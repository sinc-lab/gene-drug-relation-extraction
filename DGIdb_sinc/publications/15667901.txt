abstract
objectives. to evaluate the efficacy and potency of clinically available celecoxib for inhibition of ureteral
contractility and prostanoid release. we have previously reported that the selective cyclooxygenase (cox)-2
inhibitor ns-398 inhibits ureteral contractility.
methods. we evaluated the release of prostaglandin (pg) e2, f2␣, d2, thromboxane b2 (a thromboxane2
metabolite), and 6-keto-pgf1␣ (a prostacyclin metabolite) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from
porcine ureters in the presence and absence of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf-␣), a putative cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inducer. pge2 and pgf2␣ were the prostanoids released in greatest quantity in response to
tnf-␣. we subsequently measured spontaneous contractility and prostanoid release in porcine ureters
treated with 0.1, 1.0, or 10 ␮m concentrations of indomethacin (nonselective cox inhibitor), ns-398,
celecoxib, or 0.1%  xxxd1896xxx  (vehicle) for 2 hours. ureteral contractility and prostanoid release
were measured every 15 minutes after the addition of the various compounds. we also treated ureters with
10 ng/ml tnf-␣ and all three cox inhibitors or  xxxd1896xxx  for 2 and 4 hours and measured the pge2
and pgf2␣ release.
results. celecoxib, indomethacin, and ns-398 inhibited ureteral contractility and prostanoid release with
similar efficacy and potency. all three compounds also reduced tnf-␣-induced prostanoid release to control
levels at concentrations as low as 0.1 ␮m.
conclusions. our data have indicated that celecoxib and indomethacin inhibit pg release by the ureter to a
similar degree, even in the presence of cox-2 induction. animal experiments and clinical trials evaluating the
safety and efficacy of celecoxib for the treatment of symptomatic ureteral obstruction are warranted. urology

bstructive diseases of the ureter are among the
most painful and common disorders treated
by urologists.1 the most common cause of ureteral
obstruction is urinary calculi,2 but obstruction is
also caused by strictures, tumors, stents, diverticulum, lower pole crossing vessels, and persistent
umbilical artery.2 the lifetime incidence of sympthis study was funded in part by a grant from pfizer (formerly

tomatic stone disease alone is 13% for americans,
resulting in a cost of more than $2 billion annually.3,4 intravenous narcotics remain the mainstay of
treatment of urinary stone pain, despite the possibility of severe sedation, mood alteration, and dependency.5
increased ureteral contractility is central to the
pain induction associated with ureteral obstruction.6 contractility originates in the renal pelvis
from electrical activity at pacemaker sites and
propagates distally, creating peristalsis and urine
propulsion.7 during obstruction, increased intraluminal pressure and volume induce a transient
increase in peristaltic wave amplitude and frequency and increased renal back pressure. hypercontractility and stretch significantly potentiate
pain.8
prostanoids (prostaglandins [pgs], thromboxanes, and prostacyclins) mediate contractility,
pressure, and pain during obstruction.9,10 the two
mechanisms are prostanoid receptor activation,

resulting in increased smooth muscle tone and
contractility,9 and sensitization of nociceptors, potentiating sensory afferent stimulation.10 cyclooxygenase (cox) synthesizes prostanoids from  xxxd208xxx  and exists in two isoforms: cox-1 and
cox-2.11 cox-1 is present in most human tissues
and catalyzes homeostatic prostanoid synthesis,
regulating gastric mucous secretion, immune response, and blood flow.11 although cox-1 expression can be regulated, it is usually expressed constitutively.11 conversely, cox-2 expression is
profoundly increased by inflammation.11 ureteral
obstruction is associated with increased cox-2 expression, identifying cox-2 as a logical target of
therapy.12 we have previously shown that selective
cox-2 inhibitors decrease in vitro contractility of
the human ureter.13 the purpose of this study was
to evaluate the efficacy of clinically available celecoxib (a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor) for inhibition of in vitro ureteral contractility and prostanoid release.
material and methods
ureteral segments
we obtained ureteral segments from freshly killed domestic
swine (johnsonville foods, watertown, wis). the urinary
tract was removed and placed immediately in krebs buffer (ph
7.4) composed of 119 mm nacl; 1 mm nah2po4; 4.7 mm
kcl; 2.5 mm cacl2; 0.5 mm mgcl2; 25 mm nahco3; and 25
mm glucose. the specimens were transported to the laboratory in krebs buffer (45 minutes). we isolated 6 to 8-cm sections of ureter from the renal pelvis and divided them into 4 to
5-mm segments.

prostanoid release by gas chromatography-mass
spectrophotometry
the ureteral segments were equilibrated for 1 hour at
37°c in krebs buffer. next, we incubated the tissues for 15
minutes in krebs buffer and collected the buffer for basal
prostanoid release. we replaced the solution with buffer
containing 10 ng/ml  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf-␣)
plus 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) or bsa alone (control) to induce cox-2 expression. once per hour, we replaced the buffer for a 15-minute incubation; this buffer
was collected for evaluation of prostanoid release. this was
repeated every hour for 4 hours. next, 100 ␮l of each
collection was added to 100 ␮l of methanol and 25 ␮l of
tetra-deuterated internal standards of prostanoid degradation: [2h4]-pgf2␣, 5.2 ng/25 ␮l; [2h4]- xxxg1073xxx , 2.8 ng/25
␮l; [2h4]-pge2, 2.2 ng/25 ␮l; [2h4]-thromboxane b2, 1.1
ng/25 ␮l; and [2h4]-6-keto-pgf1␣, 3.5 ng/25 ␮l. this was
assayed for pg release as previously described.14 in brief,
the samples were dried under nitrogen, the residue was
treated with 2%  xxxd2601xxx  hydrochloride dissolved in
pyridine, and excess pyridine was evaporated under nitrogen. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was
performed with a finnigan model 9611 gas chromatograph
interfaced with a finnigan mat 4610b ei/ci mass spectrometer (finnigan mat, san jose, calif). the data were
analyzed with the superincos data system, with a sensitivity
of less than 0.1 fmol per injection for each pg. the concentration of pgf2␣, pge2,  xxxg1073xxx , thromboxane b2 (thromboxane metabolite), and 6-keto-pgf1␣ (prostacyclin me186

figure 1. (a) using gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry, we measured in vitro prostanoid release

0.045) and pgf2␣ release (n ⫽ 3, p ⫽ 0.036) compared
with control tissues (asterisk indicates statistical significance). release of other prostanoids was not altered
significantly by tnf-␣ treatment. (b) ureteral contractility was enhanced by treatment with tnf-␣ for 2 and
4 hours (n ⫽ 4, p ⫽ 0.001). this enhancement was
attenuated by addition of 1 ␮m ns-398, celecoxib, and
indomethacin, suggesting a cox-2-dependent mechanism of contractility induction. inhibition of contractility
was similar in cox inhibitor-treated tissues with or without tnf-␣ induction, and 0.1% dmso did not have a
significant effect on tissues in any experiments.
tabolite) in each sample were calculated by integration of
the line and determination of the area under the curve.
these values were compared with a standard curve and
adjusted for auto-oxidation by determination of the degradation of the tetra-deuterated internal standards. for each
prostanoid, the concentration per milliliter per gram of tissue was calculated. this procedure determined that the
prostanoids released in greatest quantity by the ureters
were pge2 and pgf2␣ (see results section); therefore, we
measured the release of these prostanoids to evaluate the
cox inhibitors in subsequent studies.

ureteral contractility
we incised ureteral segments longitudinally to open the
lumen and suspended them by opposite corners, as previously
described.15 the segments were kept in aerated krebs buffer
(95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) at 37°c during preparation. we suspended the segments in water-jacketed tissue
baths containing aerated krebs buffer (37°c) between stainless steel hangers. the tissues were attached to force displacement transducers (grass ft-o3), and tension was displayed
on a polygraph (grass model 79). the initial tension was set at
4 g, which we had found optimal for this preparation in previously performed experiments.15 the tissues were equilibrated in krebs buffer for 1 hour, during which the buffer was
replaced and tension readjusted every 15 minutes.
after equilibration, we incubated the tissues for 15 minutes.
the spontaneous contractile rates were recorded, and the
buffer was collected for basal release of pge2 and pgf2␣. we
replaced the krebs buffer and added 0.1, 1.0, or 10 ␮m doses
of ns-398 (laboratory-tested cox-2 inhibitor), celecoxib
(clinically available, highly selective cox-2 inhibitor), indomethacin (nonselective cox inhibitor), or 0.1%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso). the buffer was collected and replaced every
15 minutes for 2 hours, and the contractile rate was recorded.
all collections were evaluated for pge2 and pgf2␣ release by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cayman chemical,
ann arbor, mich) using manufacturer-directed conditions.
the contractile rates were calculated as the percentage of decrease from the spontaneous rates, and the concentration required to decrease the contractile rate by 50% (ec50) and the
effective time to 50% inhibition (et50) were calculated.
additional tissues were suspended, equilibrated, and
treated with 1 ␮m ns-398, celecoxib, or indomethacin. after 1
hour of exposure to the cox inhibitors or dmso, the buffer
was replaced with buffer containing cox inhibitors and either
10 ng/ml tnf-␣ plus 0.1% bsa to induce cox-2 expression
or bsa alone (control). we replaced the buffer for a 15-minute
incubation period; this buffer was collected for evaluation of
prostanoid release. this was repeated once per hour for 4
hours. all samples were evaluated for pge2 and pgf2␣ release
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cayman chemical)
using manufacturer-directed conditions.

statistical analysis
the contractile rates were calculated as the percentage of
decrease from the spontaneous rates for each time point after
the addition of the cox inhibitors. the ec50 and et50 were
also calculated and compared among the inhibitors. the
amount of pge2 and pgf2␣ release was calculated using the
standard curve calculations and picograms per milliliter per
gram of tissue. the percentage of pg concentrations at each
time point relative to basal release was calculated, and the
ec50 and et50 were calculated and compared among the inhibitors. all treatments (ns-398, celecoxib, indomethacin,
urology 65 (1), 2005

and dmso) were compared using a split plot analysis of variance, with fisher’s protected least significant difference test to
examine differences between treatments. next, one-on-one
pair-wise comparisons of the ec50 and et50 values were performed. p ⬍0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis
of tnf-␣-induced pg release
tnf-␣ stimulated a 3.4-fold increase in pge2 release (p ⫽ 0.045) and a 2.3-fold increase in pgf2␣
release (p ⫽ 0.036) greater than control tissues (n ⫽
3; fig. 1a). the prostanoids released in greatest
quantity from ureteral tissue were pge2 and pgf2␣,
particularly when cox-2 was induced. these prostanoids were measured in subsequent studies to determine the efficacy of the cox inhibitors.
tnf-␣ increased ureteral contractility, with
maximal effect 4 hours after tnf-␣ exposure (fig.
1b). treatment with 1 ␮m ns-398, celecoxib, or
indomethacin completely inhibited this induction.
no statistically significant difference was found between tnf-␣-induced and control tissues in the
presence of ns-398, celecoxib, or indomethacin,
indicating that all three inhibitors were able to attenuate the effect of cox induction completely.
concentrations of tnf-␣ greater than 10 ng/ml
did not produce a greater induction of prostanoid
release or contractility, although lesser concentrations produced submaximal induction (data not
shown). in addition, pretreating tissues for 1 hour
with 0.1, 1.0, or 10 ␮m  xxxd208xxx  (the cox
substrate) had no effect (data not shown).
inhibition of ureteral contractility and
prostanoid release
all doses of celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin significantly inhibited contractility after 60
minutes of treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (table i). no statistically significant
differences were observed among the treatments.
similarly, all three treatments inhibited pge2 and
pgf2␣ release in a concentration-dependent manner; no statistically significant differences were observed among the treatments (table i). in seg187

figure 2. (a) spontaneous ureteral contractility was
significantly reduced by 1 ␮m concentrations of celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin. split-plot analysis of
variance indicated that all three inhibitors significantly
(asterisk) reduced contractility at 45, 60, 75, 90, and
120 minutes of treatment (p ⬍0.05, n ⫽ 5). fisher’s
protected pair-wise comparisons determined that no
statistically significant differences existed among inhibitors. (b) pge2 release was significantly reduced by
1-␮m concentrations of celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin. split-plot analysis of variance indicated that
all three inhibitors significantly (asterisk) reduced release at all points between 30 and 120 minutes of
treatment (p ⬍0.05, n ⫽ 5). fisher’s protected pairwise comparisons determined that indomethacin was
significantly (diamonds) more effective than celecoxib
or ns-398 at 60 minutes (p ⫽ 0.02 for celecoxib and p
⫽ 0.01 for ns-398) and 90 minutes (p ⫽ 0.017 celecoxib and p ⫽ 0.007 ns-398). (c) pgf2␣ release was
significantly reduced by 1-␮m concentrations of celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin. split-plot analysis of
variance indicated that all three inhibitors significantly
(asterisk) reduced release at all intervals between 30
and 120 minutes of treatment (p ⬍0.05, n ⫽ 5). fisher’s protected pair-wise comparisons determined that
indomethacin was significantly (diamonds) more effective than celecoxib or ns-398 at 60 minutes (p ⫽ 0.007
for celecoxib and p ⫽ 0.002 for ns-398) and more
effective than ns-398 (plus sign) at 75 minutes (p ⫽
0.008).

ences were observed among the inhibitors. similarly,
all inhibitors decreased pge2 and pgf2␣ release by
more than 50% by 90 minutes; indomethacin was
more effective at inhibiting pge2 and pgf2␣ release than celecoxib or ns-398 (fig. 2b,c and table i). dmso alone had no effect on contractility
compared with untreated tissues throughout the
course of the experiment.

ments treated with a single 1-␮m dose of celecoxib,
ns-398, or indomethacin, all three drugs inhibited
greater than 50% of contractility before 90 minutes
of treatment (fig. 2a and table i). all three inhibitors reduced contractility significantly compared
with control, but no statistically significant differ188

inhibition of tnf-␣-induced pg release
celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin inhibited
tnf-␣-induced pge2 and pgf2␣ release in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (fig. 3a,b).
tnf-␣ induced a 5.0-fold increase in pge2 release
and a 4.1-fold increase in pgf2␣ release compared
with control after 4 hours. this induction was
slightly more pronounced than previously determined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, reflecting the differences between the assays
and tissues. these effects were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by all inhibitors, beginning with 50% to 80% reductions at 0.01 ␮m
and reaching complete inhibition at 1 ␮m.

lective cox inhibitor. in addition, celecoxib reduced prostanoid release in the presence of
substantial cox induction by tnf-␣. these findings suggest that cox-2 is primarily involved in
sustaining contractility and prostanoid release in
the ureter in response to tnf-␣. tnf-␣ induces
cox-2 expression and prostanoid release similar
to obstruction in the ureter.16 this mediator was
used to mimic the obstructive condition of cox-2
induction while allowing reproducible cox induction and reference to intra-ureteral “basal” prostanoid release not possible with obstruction models. the improved inhibition of prostanoid release
exhibited by indomethacin suggests a minor role
for cox-1 in this system. the capacity of celecoxib
to inhibit contractility during cox induction suggests that it may be useful to treat obstructive conditions such as stone-induced ureteral obstruction.
nonselective cox inhibitors such as indomethacin, diclofenac, and ketorolac have been used to
treat ureteral colic.17 although clinically effective,
urology 65 (1), 2005

they have caused gastric ulceration, platelet aggregation disruption, and kidney insufficiency.18 –20
therefore, opiates are still the most common therapy for treating urinary stone and obstruction-induced pain, despite the sedation and potential for
dependency.5 the identification of efficacious
cox-2 inhibitors could markedly improve urinary
stone pain treatment.
celecoxib was designed to access the cox-2 active site specifically without access to the cox-1
active site. the cox-1 and cox-2 binding sites
both have a key interacting tyrosine residue and
heme cofactor, binding sites necessary for catalysis
of pgg2 and subsequent conversion to pgh2.21
serine 530 (serine 516 in cox-2) allows for hydrogen bonding with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs such as indomethacin, ketorolac, or diclofenac and acylation by aspirin, hence, the nonspecificity of these drugs.21 however, key primary
amino acid differences exist between cox-2 and
cox-1. cox-2 replaces isoleucine 523 with the
smaller valine 509 and phenylalanine 503 with the
smaller leucine 489, allowing access of active site
“side pockets” to drugs with large multiple carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups. in addition, cox-2
replaces histidine 513 with arginine 499, facilitating hydrogen bonding with sulfonamide or sulfone
groups. therefore, these moieties are exploited in
selective cox-2 inhibitor design.21
the selectivity and efficacy of celecoxib support its use for ureteral colic. however, concerns
still exist regarding selective cox-2 inhibitors.
long-term evaluation of selective cox-2 inhibitors indicates that gastric and platelet-disrupting side effects are substantially reduced with
cox-2 inhibitors compared with nonselective
agents.22 although the overall occurrence of renal insufficiency associated with cox-2 inhibitors is less than that associated with nonselective
agents, renal failure has been reported in patients receiving cox-2 inhibitor treatment concurrent with urinary obstruction.23 in addition,
administering selective cox-2 inhibitors to rats
with ureteral obstruction reduced renal blood
flow and renal vascular prostacyclin release contralaterally; this was dependent on the angiotensin-2 receptor.24 a safety evaluation of the use of
cox-2 inhibitors during ureteral obstruction is
critical if this therapy is to gain widespread acceptance for the treatment of the pain associated
with ureteral calculi.
conclusions
celecoxib, ns-398, and indomethacin have similar efficacy and potency in the inhibition of ureteral contractility and prostanoid release. animal
and clinical trials are warranted to determine the
189

efficacy and safety of selective cox-2 blockade for
the treatment of symptomatic ureteral obstruction.
