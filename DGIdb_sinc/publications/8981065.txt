introduction
it has been recognized that angiotensin fang) ii plays very important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension via the renin-angiotensin system, and the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors have been widely used in clinical treatment of hypertension
(hall, 1989). in addition, preclinical and clinical development of
ang ii-receptor antagonists is now in progress. however, because
the antagonists, ang li analogous, often exert a partial agonistic action and ace inhibitors potentiate kinin action (abe et al., 1976,
1980; streeten and anderson, 1984; zusman, 1984; wong et al.,
1990a; fenoy et al., 1991; hajj-ali and zimmerman, 1991), these
agents possess some handicaps for clinical use as therapeutic drugs.
consequently, much research effort has been made to design a nonpeptide ang ii-receptor antagonist. furukawa and coworkers (1982)
have discovered the nonpeptide ang ii-receptor antagonists, the
imidazoleacetic acid derivatives, which are without partial agonistic
properties. thereafter, the chemical structure of this compound has
led the way for the design of other, more potent compounds, such
as losartan (dup 753) (wong et al. 1990a) and exp3174 (wong et
d., 1990b).  xxxd2150xxx , 5-[(3,5-dibutyl-lh- xxxd17xxx -l-yl)methyl]2-[2-(1h-tetrazob5-ylphenyl)] pyridine, was later synthesized as the
nonpeptide ang i1 receptor-selective antagonist (olins et al., 1993)
(fig. 1).
it has been well-documented that ang i1 exerts action via not
only direct stimulation of the ang ii receptors, but also by stimulating release of acetylcholine (ach) from the nerve terminals in the
smooth muscle of the guinea-pig ileum (robertson and rubin, 1962;

godfraind et al., 1966; hawcock and barnes, 1993), because the
contraction induced by ang 1i is inhibited by tetrodotoxin (ttx)
and atropine. these results have indicated that, in the tissues where
the ang ii-induced contraction was suppressed by ttx and atropine, the relationship between ang ii and the antagonist may be
only limited. however, in our preliminary study on the guinea-pig
isolated longitudinal muscle of taenia coli, the contraction induced
by ang ii was not affected by ttx or atropine.
in the present study we, therefore, evaluated the effects of sc52458 on peak and plateau components of the contraction induced
by ang ii in the guinea-pig taenia coli, as compared with [sarl]-  xxxg99xxx  (1-7) amide ([sarl]-ang ii), a peptide ang ii receptorselective antagonist (bovy et al., 1989).
materials and methods

measurements of tension developments
male guinea pigs weighing 250-350 g were killed by stunning and
bleeding and the taenia coli was excised. the longitudinal muscle
segment, about 1 mm in width and 1 mm in length, was dissected
using the technique previously described (usune et al., 1986). then,
the segment was suspended in a bath, about 0.1 ml, and superfused
with a modified krebs solution at 2 ml/min by the peristaltic pump
(gilson,  xxxg623xxx , villiers le bel, france). the solution,  xxxg2020xxx , 121.4;
kci, 5.9; caciz, 2.5; mgci2, 1.2; nahco~, 15.5 and glucose, 11.5
(mm), was kept at ph 7.4 by bubbling with 95% 02 and 5% coe
and at 32°c during the experiment to inhibit the spontaneous contraction. the contractions were isometrically recorded with a straingauge transducer (toyo-baldwin, t7-8-240, tokyo, japan). after a
loading of 3 mn to the segment, each preparation was allowed to

added by 2-min intervals. the experiments started 30 min after exposure of the tissue to the solution with antagonist. amplitude of
the peak and plateau component evoked by ang ii was obtained by
tonic increase from the control plateau levels before application of
ang ii. the values were expressed as a percent change (mean) in
each amplitude from control maximal peak and plateau components
(100%) induced by ang ii in the absence of  xxxd2150xxx . pa2 and
slope values were determined from schild plots using the schild
equation as described previously (arunlakshana and schild, 1959).
the data from preparations were analyzed when the amplitude of
the contraction induced by ang ii (10 s m) was recovered to the
original level after removal of the antagonists. in addition, the data
from the tissue in which the amplitude of spontaneous contractions
was greater than ang ii (10 -~ m)-induced sustained contractions
were excluded.

equilibrate for about 30 min (for electrical nerve stimulation) or 3
hr (for application of ang ii and induction of k+-depolarization) in
the flowing bath before starting the experiment.
to investigate the effects of agents on nerve stimulation of the
taenia coli, the tissues were electrically field-stimulated using platinum electrodes with a train of pulses for 3 sec at 8-12 v, 8 hz and a
duration of 0.3 msec using a stimulator (nihon kohden, sen-3201,
japan) at 25-sec intervals. the voltage level was elevated until the
contraction had reached a peak amplitude, and the experiments
started when the amplitude of the contractile responses had reached
a steady state. values of the contractile responses in the presence of
ttx, atropine,  xxxd2150xxx  and cgp-42112a were expressed as a
percent change (mean) from the control responses (100%) before
application of these drugs.
from the pattern of contraction induced by ang ii or k+-depolarization, the contraction was divided into the peak amplitude of
the very rapid component ( < < 1 min) and the plateau amplitude
of the slow component (1-2 min) and was, thereby, measured as the
respective components. application of ang ii or induction of k+depolarization was made for 1-2 rain at intervals of 20 min. all experiments started when the amplitude of contractile responses to
the agents had reached a steady state. ttx, atropine,  xxxd2150xxx  and
cgp-42112a were added to the solution 10 min before the second
application or induction. the second application or induction was
carried out 20 min after the first application or induction in the absence of each agent. values of responses induced by the second application or induction were expressed as a percent change (mean)
from the responses (100%) to the first application or induction in
the absence of these agents. in addition, the value of the second application or induction in the absence of these agents was measured
as control response for statistical analysis. the concentration-inhibition curves by antagonists of ang ii-induced contractions were
obtained from peak and plateau components of the sustained contraction induced by various concentrations of ang ii, 10-9-10 6 m,

measurements of cytoplasmic ca z+
concentrations and tension development
the longitudinal muscle segment of taenia coli, about 2 mm in
width and 7 mm in length, was prepared using the technique previously described (usune et al., 1989). to minimize movement artifacts, one end of the segment was fixed on a silicon board by fine
insect pins, but another end of the tissue, about 1 mm in length, remained free for measurement of force development. then, the segment was loaded with krebs solution containing 5 >m fura-2/am
with 0.5% dmso and 0.01% pluronic f-127 (a non-cytotoxic detergent) for 3-5 hr at room temperature (23-25°c), and was then
rinsed with krebs solution. thereafter, the segment was suspended
in a bath, about 0.5 ml, and superfused with modified krebs solution, 32°c, at 2.4 ml/min by the peristaltic pump. contractions of
the tissue were isometrically recorded with a strain-gauge transducer
(hbm, w0.5t, darmstadt, germany). the fluorescence signals and
contractions were simultaneouslymeasured in the same preparation.
fluorescence signals were measured by a double beam fluorimeter
(japan spectroscopic, cam-220, tokyo, japan). the muscle strips
loaded with fura-2, were illuminated alternately (400 hz) at 340_
+
10 nm and 380--_10 nm of the excitation wavelengths. both the
amount of fluorescence (510_+0.5 nm) induced by 340 nm (f340)and
380 nm (f3s0) excitation were measured, respectively, and f340/f3s0
referred to the fluorescence ratio. in the muscle strips that were successfully loaded with fura-2, the increase in the cytoplasmic ca 2+
concentrations ([ca>d resulted in an increase in f340,a decrease in
f3s0and an increase in the fluorescence ratio. the ratio was used to
monitor the relative [ca>], (himpens and somlyo 1988). the
changes of [ca>]~ levels that employed the ratio were calculated using a calibration curve between fura-2 and ca > in distilled water.
in the absence of fura-2, ang ii and  xxxd2150xxx , no autofluorescence was caused. fluorescence experiments were, then, confirmed
from the fact that the fluorescence signals from the strip excited at
wavelength (380 nm) were decreased by ang 11.

treatments with modified krebs solution and drugs
hyperosmotic k*-depolarizing solution (k +, 40 mm) was prepared
by addition of solid kci to the modified krebs solution. nifedipine
was dissolved with ethanol (50%) to make a stock solution of 10 s
m before dilution in distilled water. the final concentration of the
solvent was limited to 0.05%. the solvent used at this concentration did not affect contractility. other agents were dissolved with
distilled water.

results

contractile responses to
electrical field stimulation and ang ii
electrical field stimulation of the tissue evoked a contraction (fig.
2a), and ang ii, 10 s m, caused a sustained contraction consisting
of peak and plateau components (fig. 3a). the contraction evoked
by field stimulation was abolished by ttx, 10 7 m, and atropine,
10 -~' m, but not by  xxxd2150xxx , 10 `5 m, and cgp-42112a, an  xxxg101xxx 
receptor antagonist, 10 -6 m (fig. 2).
in contrast, both the components of the contraction induced by
ang ii were unaffected by ttx, atropine or cgp-42112a (fig. 3).

first application of ang ii. each column indicates mean-+se
(n=5-10). each column compared mean values in the absence
and presence of the agent (student's t-test).

vals of 20 min, amplitudes of the peak and plateau components induced by the 6th application of ang 1i were 103.6-+2.9 and
101.9-+2.9% (n=5), respectively, as compared with each control response (100%) evoked by the first application, showing that the 6
repeated applications caused almost constant response. the lack of
difference in the value of peak and plateau components between
those caused by the first and sixth application also indicates that
 xxxd2150xxx  does not affect the contraction induced by nerve activities and that both the components of the ang ii-induced contraction do not involve nerve activities or  xxxg101xxx  receptor stimulation. in
addition, tachyphylaxis is not caused in the peak and plateau components. the fi)llowing experiments were then undertaken.

components of ang ii.induced contractions
the peak and plateau components of contractions induced by ang

in fig. 4a. as compared with each control response (100%) before

returned to the control responses with, respectively, 97.3_+3.4 and

components are shown in fig. 4b. the concentration-response

by  xxxd2150xxx  or [sart]-ang i1, 10-7-10 s m (data not shown). from
these data, schild plots of  xxxd2150xxx  and [sarl]-ang ii were made

to have other actions in addition to ang ii-receptor antagonism.

component, was suppressed by  xxxd2150xxx , 0.1 and 1.0 izm. each amplitude of the peak and plateau components returned to 104.2-+2.1
and 96.9-+ 1.7% (n=5) of each control response (100%) before sc52458, 50 min after the removal.
discussion
in this study on the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig taenia coli,
ang ii evoked a sustained contraction consisting of peak and plateau components in a concentration-dependent manner, 10-9-10 6
m. ang ii was reported to induce the tachyphylaxis because nearmaximal responses to ang ii failed to keep consistent contractile responses on subsequent application in guinea-pig ileum (miasiro et
al., 1983; shimuta et al., 1989). however, each amplitude of both
components of the contraction induced by ang ii, 10 -6 m, was not
changed by its 6 times repeated applications in the present experiment. therefore, it is indicated that the ang ll-induced contraction
does not cause tachyphylaxis in the longitudinal muscle of taenia
coli under the present experimental conditions.
ang ii was demonstrated to exert action via both release of ach
and direct stimulation in the guinea-pig ileum smooth muscle (robertson and rubin, 1962; godfraind et al., 1966). in addition, hawcock and barnes (1993) have reported that ang ii-evoked contraction may be mediated by release of ach in longitudinal muscle of
guinea-pig small intestine because the contraction was inhibited by
ttx and atropine, implying that the contractile response involves
a neuronal component. in addition, ang ii receptors have been divided into two subtypes, type 1 (at~ receptors) and type 2 receptors

( xxxg101xxx  receptors) (bumpus et al., 1991). at1 receptors are antagonized by a nonpeptide at~ receptor-selective antagonist,  xxxd2150xxx 
(olins et al., 1993) and losartan (chiu et al., 1989; whitebread et
al., 1989), and  xxxg101xxx  receptors have high affinity for cgp-42112a,
an  xxxg101xxx  receptor-specific antagonist (whitebread et al., 1991; p6rsti
et al., 1993). in the present experiment, the contraction induced by
electrical field stimulation of the tissue was abolished, but the peak
and plateau components of contractions evoked by ang ii, 10 -s m,
were unaffected by ttx or atropine. in addition, the contraction by
field stimulation was not inhibited by  xxxd2150xxx  or cgp-42112a.
accordingly, the ang ii-induced contraction seems to involve the
direct activation of ang ii receptors in the muscles, without involving the neuronal component.
the peak and plateau components of ang ii-induced contractions were inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by  xxxd2150xxx ,
10-s-10 -6 m, and [sart]-ang ii, 10-7-10 5 m, ang ii receptor-selective antagonists (bovy et al., 1989), and the concentration-response
curves to ang ii of both the components were thereby shifted to the
right by these antagonists. on the other hand, both the components
were unaffected by cgp-42112a. furthermore, in the fluorescence
study with fura-2, the increases in [ca2+]i induced by ang ii were
coupled with the peak and plateau components. both increases in
[ca:+]1 and peak, as well as plateau, components were suppressed to
the same degree by  xxxd2150xxx . accordingly, the  xxxd2150xxx -induced
suppression of the peak and plateau components of ang ii-induced
contractions seems to be attributable to a reduction of [ca2+], v/a inhibition of ang ii receptor, probably ati receptor, stimulation in
the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig taenia coli. furthermore, pa2
values from schild plot analysis of  xxxd2150xxx  and [sarl]-ang ii were
8.40 and 7.15 for the peak component and 8.70 and 6.94 for the plateau component, indicating that  xxxd2150xxx  inhibits the peak and
plateau components from a lower concentration than [sarq-ang ii.
also, [sar~]-ang ii, but not  xxxd2150xxx , exerts a partial agonistic action because only [sari]-ang ii evokes a transient contraction at a
concentration of 10 -5 m.
from analysis of slope values (1.00) of the peak component obtained from the schild plot,  xxxd2150xxx  seems to be a competitive
antagonist for ang ii receptors. however, the slope value of the plateau component by  xxxd2150xxx  was 0.83 and the inhibition by sc52458 of increases in [ca2+], coupled with the plateau component
induced by ang ii, was significantly stronger than that coupled with
peak one and, similarly, the plateau component than that with peak
one. consequently,  xxxd2150xxx  may have other actions in addition
to selective antagonism for at1 receptors. thereafter, effects of sc52458 on the peak and plateau components of the sustained contraction induced by k+-depolarization (k ÷, 40 mm) were done. the
plateau component, but not peak one, was suppressed by  xxxd2150xxx ,
0.1 and 1.0 ixm, and nifedipine, 10 nm, a voltage-operated l-type
ca > channel-selective antagonist. in the same guinea-pig taenia
coli used in the present experiment, we have reported that the pla-

teau component of sustained contraction induced by k +-depolarization that is inhibited by nifedipine is caused by increase of intracellular ca 2+ through voltage-operated l-type ca 2+ channels (usune
et al., 1988). it has been well documented that the source of ca 2+
mobilization in the smooth muscle for a very rapid peak component
is the release from intracellular stored ca 2÷ and the source for the
plateau component is an influx of extracellular ca :+ through voltage-dependent c a 2+ channels, which is blocked by ca > antagonists

(verapamil, gallopamil, nifedipine,  xxxd2728xxx , etc.) (bohr, 1973;
bolton, 1979; daniel et al., 1979; yousif and triggle, 1986) and receptor-operated channels (bolton, 1979). thus, it is suggested that,
in addition to ang ii-receptor antagonism,  xxxd2150xxx  also inhibits
this type of ca 2+ channel. this profile in the effect of  xxxd2150xxx 
may be a virtue in causing smooth muscle relaxation.
the results indicate that  xxxd2150xxx  reduces increases in [ca2+]~
and consequent contractions produced by ang ii via at] receptor
activation and, also, displays ca2+-antagonistic profile in the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig taenia coll.
summary
effects of a nonpeptide angiotensin (ang) ii-receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2150xxx , on the peak and plateau components of ang ii-induced
contraction were evaluated in isolated longitudinal muscle of the
guinea-pig taenia coli, as compared with [sar]]-ang ii, a peptide antagonist. electrical field stimulation of the tissue induced a contraction and ang ii evoked a sustained contraction consisting of peak
and plateau components in a concentration-dependent manner,
10-9_10 6 m. the contraction produced by field stimulation, but
not the peak and plateau components evoked by ang ii, 10 -8 m,
was abolished by ttx, 10 7 m and atropine, 10 -6 m. however, the
field-stimulated contraction was not affected by  xxxd2150xxx , 10 -5 m,
an ati receptor-selective antagonist or cgp-42112a, 10 -6 m, an
 xxxg101xxx  receptor-specific antagonist. both components of contraction
induced by ang ii, 10 -6 m, were unchanged by 6 repeated applica-

tions, implying lack of tachyphylaxis. both the components induced
by ang ii, 10 s m, were inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by
 xxxd2150xxx , 10 8-10 6 m, and [sart]-ang ii, 10-7-10 -5 m, with shift
to the right of both the components in concentration-response
curves. the apparent pa2 values from schild plot analysis of sc52458 and [sarl]-ang ii were 8.40 and 7.15 for the peak component
and 8.70 and 6.94 for the plateau component, and the slopes 1.00
and 1.13 for the peak component and 0.83 and 0.87 for the plateau
component, respectively. also, [sar~]-ang ii, but not  xxxd2150xxx ,
evoked a transient contraction  xxxd1891xxx  -5 m. o n the other hand, both
the components induced by ang ii were unaffected by cgp42112a. in fluorescence studies with fura-2 as [ca2+]i indicator, the
increases in [ca2+]i coupled with the peak and plateau components
of contraction evoked by ang ii, 10 7 m, were inhibited by sc52458, 10 -7 m. the inhibition was greater in the increases in [ca2+],
coupled with the plateau component than those coupled with the
peak component. in addition, the plateau component, but not the
peak component, of the sustained contraction induced by k+-depo larization (k +, 40 mm), which was inhibited by nifedipine, 10 nm,
a selective antagonist of voltage-operated l-type ca 2+ channels, was
also suppressed by  xxxd2150xxx  at 0.1 and 1.0 ixm. the results indicate
that ang ii may evoke the peak and plateau components of the sustained contraction by [ca2+]~increase mediated via ang ii (at1) receptor activation in the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig taenia
coli, and that  xxxd2150xxx  exerts potent ang ii-receptor antagonistic
effects accompanied with reduction in the increase of [ca2+]l by ltype ca 2÷ channel antagonism.
