prostate cancer is often slowly progressive, and it can be difficult
to treat with conventional cytotoxic drugs. nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs inhibit the development of prostate cancer, but
the mechanism of chemoprevention is unknown. here, we show
that the r-enantiomer of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
 xxxd2065xxx  inhibited tumor development and metastasis in the transgenic mouse adenocarcinoma of the prostate (tramp) model, by
selective induction of apoptosis in the tumor cells. this proapoptotic effect was associated with loss of the retinoid x receptor
(rxr␣) protein in the adenocarcinoma cells, but not in normal
prostatic epithelium. r- xxxd2065xxx  specifically bound recombinant
rxr␣, inhibited rxr␣ transcriptional activity, and induced its
degradation by a ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent pathway.
the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx  could be controlled by manipulating cellular rxr␣ levels. these results document that pharmacologic antagonism of rxr␣ transactivation is achievable and can
have profound inhibitory effects in cancer development.

s

everal epidemiological studies have shown that the use of
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) is associated
with a reduced incidence of clinically detectable prostate cancer
(1–3). the side effects of cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors preclude the use of these agents in many elderly men (4). thus, there
is a major need to determine whether there are chemopreventative,
and antimetastatic effects of nsaids that can be separated from
cox inhibition. controversy has permeated this field, because
many of the cox-independent actions of nsaids are measurable
only at concentrations that are not safely achievable in vivo, and
because the members of this structurally diverse group of drugs are
metabolized extensively and can exert different mechanisms of
action (5, 6).
various nsaids have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in
malignant cells (7–9).  xxxd2065xxx  is a commercially available nsaid
containing a racemic mixture, in which the s-enantiomer has cox
inhibitory activity, whereas the r-enantiomer does not (10). unlike
all other chiral nsaids, the two enantiomers of  xxxd2065xxx  are not
metabolically interconvertible. moreover, the r-enantiomer is metabolized much more slowly than the s-enantiomer, and it accumulates to 10-fold higher concentrations than the s-enantiomer in
plasma (11). in a recent study, sufficient plasma levels of r- xxxd2065xxx 
were achieved after oral gavage in a xenograft prostate cancer
model to diminish the growth of the transplanted tumor (12).
the in vivo effect of r- xxxd2065xxx  was associated with enhancement
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) transactivation (12). ppar␥, as well as other nuclear hormone receptors,
forms heterodimers with the retinoid x receptor ␣ (rxr␣) (13,
14), which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate
cancer (15). the effect of rxr␣ may be due to its induction of
apoptosis through its interaction with other proteins (16–19). an
activating ligand of rxr␣, 9- xxxd2404xxx  (ra), is a lipophilic
acid similar to r- xxxd2065xxx . thus, we hypothesized that the coxwww.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0409721102

independent effects of r- xxxd2065xxx  in malignant prostate cells might
be attributed to its binding and modulation of rxr␣ activities.
here, we show that r- xxxd2065xxx  induced apoptosis of prostate
cancer cells, but not normal prostatic epithelial cells. the retodolac-induced apoptosis was associated with reduction of rxr␣
levels selectively in the tumor cells. direct interaction of r- xxxd2065xxx 
and rxr␣ was demonstrated by in vitro binding of radiolabeled
r- xxxd2065xxx  with the purified recombinant ligand-binding domain
(lbd) of rxr␣ and the ability of the drug to protect rxr␣
protein from trypsin digestion. in intact cells, r- xxxd2065xxx  antagonized rxr␣ transcriptional activity and induced its ubiquitination
and degradation. furthermore, suppression of rxr␣ expression
reduced the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx . these results demonstrate that rxr␣ acts as a receptor that mediates the coxindependent anticancer effects of r- xxxd2065xxx .

(tramp) and c57bl兾6 mice were purchased from the jackson
laboratory and bred at ucsd. all animal protocols received prior
approval by the institutional review board. plasma r- xxxd2065xxx  levels
were measured on a group of seven 15-week-old c57bl兾6 male
mice who were fed r- xxxd2065xxx  (1.25 mg兾kg) chow for 2 weeks by a
bioanalytical lc兾ms-based method developed by maxxam analytics (mississauga, on, canada). chiral hplc (23) was used to
confirm the lack of r- to s- xxxd2065xxx  in vivo interconversion.
we started 46 male tramp mice at 9–12 weeks of age on chow
with r- xxxd2065xxx  1.25 mg兾kg or control food (prepared by dyets,
bethlehem, pa) randomized by cage. at 30 weeks, or after appearance of a gross palpable tumor mass, the animals were sacrificed and necropsies were performed. the urogential system, the
periaortic lymph nodes, and the major organs were removed and
weighed. the prostatic tissues were dissected and separated into
individual lobes and weighed. tissues were fixed in 10% formalin
embedded in paraffin, sectioned in step sections at 50-␮m intervals,
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the prostate sections were
scored for carcinoma grade on a 1–6 scale (see supporting materials
and methods). the liver, lung, and lymph node sections were scored
for the presence or absence of tumor. the weights of the different
tissues, and the frequencies of metastases, in the drug treated and
control animals were compared by the mann–whitney test or
fisher’s exact test, with p ⬍ 0.05 considered significant.

assayed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (tdt;
tunel; chemicon) or stained with anti-human rxr␣ (d20;
santa cruz biotechnology), followed by staining with dapi (50
␮g兾ml; sigma) containing dnase-free  xxxg1963xxx  (100 ␮g兾ml;
boehringer mannheim) to visualize the nuclei and examined by
fluorescence microscopy (18, 19, 24). single-cell apoptosis was
detected in vitro by removing adherent cells from the plate with 5
mm edta, incubating them with annexin-v–phycoerythrin (bd
pharmingen) and analyzing by flow cytometry.

ligand binding. the human rxr␣ lbd (223–462), prepared as a
 xxxd2282xxx -tagged fusion protein in pet15b (novagen) (1 ␮g),
was incubated with radiolabeled ligand in the presence of different
concentrations of unlabeled 9- xxxd2404xxx  or r- xxxd2065xxx  at 4°c for 14 h.
the rxr␣ lbd was captured by nickel-coated beads. bound
radiolabeled ligand was determined in a scintillation counter.

transient-transfection assay. expression vectors for rxr␣, ra
receptor ␤ (rar␤), hemagglutinin (ha)-ubiquitin, and reporter
gene ␤rare-tk-chloramphenicol transferase (cat) were prepared and transfected as described (25, 26). we mixed ⬇300 ng of
reporter plasmid, 50 ng of ␤-gal expression vector (pch 110;
pharmacia), and vector expressing rxr␣ with carrier dna
(pbluescript) to give 1.0 ␮g of total dna per well. cat activity was
normalized for transfection efficiency on the basis of cotransfected
␤-gal gene activity. transfected cell lysates were separated by
sds兾page and immunoblotted (see supporting materials and
methods).

frozen in oct, sectioned, and subjected to tunel staining (red) and dapi (to
visualize nuclei) (⫻200). extensive apoptosis (tunel-positive) was detected in
the prostates of r- xxxd2065xxx -fed tramp mice compared with control chow-fed
mice.

transfected into cells in six-well plates by using lipofectamine plus
(invitrogen) (17).

dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of lncap prostate
cancer cells and prec normal human prostatic epithelial cells (see
fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the pnas
web site). at 72 h, the id50 values were ⬇150 ␮m for lncap,
compared with ⬇400 ␮m for prec (fig. 7a). concentrations of
r- xxxd2065xxx  of ⬎500 ␮m induced apoptosis in primary prostate
cancer explants (fig. 7 b–e). in the latter instance, the malignant
cells displayed shrunken and pyknotic nuclei, whereas the nuclei
from the adjacent normal prostatic epithelium appeared morphologically normal.

no detectable conversion of r- xxxd2065xxx  to the s-stereoisomer.
therefore, in vivo experiments in the tramp mouse model were
undertaken under these conditions. male tramp mice develop
histological intraepithelial neoplasia of the prostate by 8–12 weeks
of age that progresses to adenocarcinoma with distant site metastases by 24–28 weeks of age (27, 28). control chow or diets
supplemented with r- xxxd2065xxx  were initiated at 9–12 weeks. by 30
weeks, nearly all of the prostates in the r- xxxd2065xxx  treated and
untreated groups had macroscopic evidence of tumor (table 1).
however, both the average tumor mass (fig. 1) and the frequencies
of metastases (table 1) were significantly lower in the r-etodolactreated animals. histological evaluation of the excised tissues
confirmed the anti-metastatic effects of the drug and did not show
evidence of drug toxicity (fig. 2 a–l). collectively, these data
indicated that r- xxxd2065xxx  retarded the progression and metastasis
of prostate cancer in the tramp system.

fig. 3. rxr␣ is required for r- xxxd2065xxx -induced apoptosis. (a) inhibition of
rxr␣ expression by rxr␣ sirna. lncap cells were untransfected or transfected with a pool of rxr␣ sirnas or control gfp sirna for 48 h. cell lysates
were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against rxr␣ or ␣-tubulin.
(b) rxr␣ sirna suppresses the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx . lncap cells were
transfected with rxr␣ or control gfp sirna for 48 h and then treated with 500
␮m or 1 mm r- xxxd2065xxx  for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% fbs. apoptotic
cells were quantified by annexin-v binding and flow cytometry. similar results
were obtained in two separate experiments. the percentage of apoptosis
represents the percentage of annexin-v-positive drug-treated cells minus the
percentage of annexin-v-positive untreated transfected cells. (c) expression of
rxr␣ confers apoptotic sensitivity of r- xxxd2065xxx  in cv-1 cells. cv-1 cells were
transfected with gfp or gfp-rxr␣ in six-well plates. after overnight transfection, cells were treated with either 0.1% dmso (vehicle) or 1 mm r- xxxd2065xxx 
for 28 h, harvested, and fixed, and nuclei were stained by dapi. nuclear
morphology of the gfp-positive cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and cells showing nuclear condensation and fragmentation were scored
as apoptotic cells. shown are averages ⫾ means from two independent
evaluations of at least 200 transfected cells. (d) rxr␣⫺/⫺ f9 cells are resistant
to the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx . f9 cells or f9 cells without rxr (f9
cells⌬rxr) were treated with dmso or r- xxxd2065xxx  as indicated. apoptosis was
determined after 44 h of treatment. bars represent mean ⫹ sd from three
independent experiments.

fig. 4. r- xxxd2065xxx  binds to rxr␣. (a) r- xxxd2065xxx  competes with 9- xxxd2404xxx  for
binding to rxr␣. human rxr␣ lbd was incubated with 1 nm [3h]9- xxxd2404xxx  in
the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled 9- xxxd2404xxx  (f) or retodolac (䊐) at 4°c for 14 h. [3h]9- xxxd2404xxx  bound to rxr␣ was measured after
capturing the rxr␣ lbd by nickel-coated beads. the data represent the
average of total bound cpm ⫾ sem. one of five experiments is shown. (b)
r- xxxd2065xxx  binds directly to rxr␣. the indicated concentrations of [3h]retodolac were incubated with or without  xxxd2282xxx -tagged-rxr␣ lbd.
rxr␣-bound [3h]r- xxxd2065xxx  was separated with nickel-coated beads and
measured. one of three independent experiments is shown. (c) 9- xxxd2404xxx 
competes with r- xxxd2065xxx  for binding of rxr␣. purified rxr␣ lbd (1 ␮g) was
incubated with 1 mm [3h]r- xxxd2065xxx  in the presence of unlabeled 9- xxxd2404xxx 
(10⫺6 m) or r- xxxd2065xxx  (1 mm) as indicated. rxr␣-bound [3h]r- xxxd2065xxx  was
separated and assayed as described above.

sacrificed, and the prostates were examined for apoptosis. extensive
apoptosis in the prostates of drug-treated tramp mice was seen
on tunel staining of frozen sections, whereas no apoptosis was
seen in mice fed with control chow (fig. 2m). no apoptosis was
detectable in prostates of nontransgenic mice fed with r- xxxd2065xxx .
rxr␣ is required for the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx . a previous

study demonstrated that ppar␥ was associated with the apoptosis
induced by r- xxxd2065xxx  (12). ppar␥ heterodimerizes with rxr␣,
and thus, we examined its possible role. transfection of rxr␣specific sirna, but not control sirna, almost completely inhibited
rxr␣ expression in lncap cells (fig. 3a). the apoptotic effect of
r- xxxd2065xxx  in rxr␣ sirna-transfected cells was substantially
diminished (fig. 3b). cv-1 cells lack detectable levels of rxr␣ (25,
26), and they were relatively resistant to r- xxxd2065xxx -induced apoptosis. however, transfection of cv-1 cells with rxr␣, but not a
control vector, reversed this drug-resistant phenotype (fig. 3c).
similarly rxr␣⫺/⫺ f9 embryonal cells did not undergo apoptosis
with drug treatment compared with the extensive apoptosis in
wild-type f9 cells (fig. 3d). thus, rxr␣ is required for the
apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx .
r- xxxd2065xxx  binds to rxr␣. to investigate whether r- xxxd2065xxx  could
bind rxr␣, a ligand competition assay with [3h]9- xxxd2404xxx  was
used. both unlabeled 9- xxxd2404xxx  and r- xxxd2065xxx  displaced [3h]9cis-ra bound to rxr␣ lbd (fig. 4a), with an ic50 value of

fig. 5. r- xxxd2065xxx  inhibits 9- xxxd2404xxx -induced transcriptional activity of rxr␣.
(a) inhibition of rxr␣ homodimer activity by r- xxxd2065xxx . cv-1 cells were
cotransfected with or without an expression vector for rxr␣ (25 ng), a cat
reporter vector containing rxr homodimer responsive elements [(trepal)2tk-cat; 300 ng] and a ␤-gal expression vector (50 ng). after subsequent
treatment with 9- xxxd2404xxx  (10⫺8 m) and the indicated concentrations of retodolac for 24 h cat activities were determined and normalized relative to
the ␤-gal activity. (b) r- xxxd2065xxx  modulation of rxr␣兾rar heterodimer activity. zr-75-1 cells were transfected with ␤rare-tk-cat reporter plasmid (300
ng) and a ␤-gal expression vector (50 ng), and they were then treated with
all-trans-ra (10⫺7 m) and the indicated concentrations of r- xxxd2065xxx . cat
activities were determined as described above. (c) inhibition of trans-rainduced rar␤ protein expression by r- xxxd2065xxx . zr-75-1 cells were treated
with or without trans-ra (10⫺6 m), r- xxxd2065xxx  (1 mm), or their combination
for 24 h. rar␤ protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. (d)
inhibitory effect of r- xxxd2065xxx  on rxr␣兾ppar␥ heterodimer activity. zr-75-1
cells were transfected with ␤rare-tk-cat reporter plasmid (300 ng) and a
␤-gal expression vector (50 ng), treated with rxr ligand sr11237 (10⫺6 m) and
ppar␥ ligand ciglitazone (10⫺5 m) as well as r- xxxd2065xxx  and then cat activities
were determined. (e) r- xxxd2065xxx  inhibits rar␤ protein expression induced by
the combination of rxr and ppar␥ ligands. zr-75-1 cells were treated with or
without sr11237 (10-6 m), ciglitazone (10 ␮m), r- xxxd2065xxx  (1 mm) in the
indicated combinations. cell lysates were immunoblotted and probed for
relative levels of rar␤ and ␤-actin.

⬇200 ␮m for r- xxxd2065xxx . furthermore, [3h]r- xxxd2065xxx  directly
bound the rxr␣ lbd, and this binding was competitively
inhibited by both unlabeled r- xxxd2065xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  (fig. 4 b
and c).
r- xxxd2065xxx  binding induces conformational change in rxr␣. binding

of ligands to their receptors often induces changes in susceptibility
to proteolysis (13, 14). digestion of the rxr␣ lbd with a low
concentration of trypsin (3 ␮g兾ml) yielded a proteolytic fragment
of ⬇20 kda, whreeas higher concentrations of trypsin (10 or 30
␮g兾ml) completely digested the lbd (see fig. 8, which is published
as supporting information on the pnas web site). preincubation of
the rxr␣ lbd with 9- xxxd2404xxx  did not alter its sensitivity to trypsin
digestion, consistent with previous studies (29). however, incubakolluri et al.

in prostate of r- xxxd2065xxx -fed tramp mice. for 2 weeks, we fed 6- to 7-monthold tramp mice r- xxxd2065xxx -supplemented chow or control chow. the prostate tissues were immunostained for human rxr␣ (red), and the nuclei were
stained with dapi (⫻200). (b) r- xxxd2065xxx  induces rxr␣ degradation. lncap
cells were untreated, treated with 1 mm r- xxxd2065xxx  for 18 h, treated with
r- xxxd2065xxx  with pretreatment for 1 h with 20 ␮m mg132, or treated with
mg132 alone. cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies to human
rxr␣ and ␣-tubulin. (c) r- xxxd2065xxx  induces ubiquitination of rxr␣. expression
vectors for myc-tagged rxr␣ or rar␤, and ubiquitin (ha-tagged) were transfected into hek 293t cells. after 24 h, the cells were treated with r- xxxd2065xxx 
(1 mm), lysed after 24 h, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody.
the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with an anti-ha antibody to
detect ubiquitinated protein. (d) r- xxxd2065xxx  induces ubiquitination of endogenous rxr␣. hek 293t cells were transfected with a vector expressing haubiquitin and then treated with r- xxxd2065xxx  as described above and 1 ␮m
synthetic retinoids as indicated. the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an
anti-ha antibody and immunoblotted with an antibody to detect rxr␣. (e)
synthetic rxr␣ ligands inhibit r- xxxd2065xxx -induced ubiquitination of rxr␣.
expression vectors for rxr␣ (myc-tagged) and ubiquitin (ha-tagged) were
transfected into hek 293t cells. cells were treated with 1 ␮m synthetic
retinoids, sr11237, sr11345, or sr11246, as indicated. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody and the precipitated proteins
were immunoblotted with an anti-ha antibody to detect ubiquitinated
protein.

tion of the rxr␣ lbd with r- xxxd2065xxx  before trypsin digestion (3
␮g兾ml) resulted in a different digestion pattern, with two new
proteolytic fragments of ⬇18 kda, in contrast to the lack of
protection detected with ppar␥ (fig. 8).
r- xxxd2065xxx  modulates rxr␣ transcriptional activity. to test whether
r- xxxd2065xxx  binding modulated rxr␣ transcriptional activity, a
kolluri et al.

localization of rxr␣ plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis
(17). to analyze whether r- xxxd2065xxx  treatment altered rxr␣
subcellular localization, in vivo immunostaining of rxr␣ was
performed on the prostate tissues from male tramp and nontransgenic littermates fed with r- xxxd2065xxx  or control chow. rxr␣
was predominantly localized in the nucleus in the prostates of the
nontransgenic mice fed with or without r- xxxd2065xxx  chow (fig. 6a).
tramp mice fed with control chow displayed similar rxr␣
nuclear staining. however, rxr␣ staining was greatly reduced in
prostates of tramp mice fed with r- xxxd2065xxx .
rxr␣ protein levels in lncap cells were also markedly reduced
after treatment with r- xxxd2065xxx  (fig. 6b). r- xxxd2065xxx -induced
degradation of rxr␣ levels was completely prevented by the
proteosome inhibitor mg132 (fig. 6b). proteins are often ubiquitinated before degradation by proteasomes (32). thus, we determined whether r- xxxd2065xxx  induced ubiquitination of rxr␣. myctagged rxr␣ was cotransfected into hek 293t cells with or
without an expression vector for ha-tagged ubiquitin, followed by
treatment with r- xxxd2065xxx  in the presence of mg132. immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody, followed by immunoblotting
with an anti-ha antibody, revealed that rxr␣ was extensively
ubiquitinated after r- xxxd2065xxx  treatment (fig. 6c) but not after
treatment with the synthetic rxr␣ ligands sr11345 and sr11246
(fig. 6d). instead, these ligands abrogated r- xxxd2065xxx -induced
rxr␣ ubiquitination (fig. 6e), probably because of their competition for binding to rxr␣. collectively, these results demonstrate
that r- xxxd2065xxx  binds rxr␣ and induces its degradation in a
proteasome-dependent manner.
discussion
the standard therapy for progressive prostate cancer is androgen
ablation. however, many patients become unresponsive and develop metastatic disease (33). thus, there is a compelling need for
the development of unconventional agents that can delay the
progression of prostate cancer. in this article, we report that chronic
oral administration of the cox-inactive r-stereoisomer of the
common nsaid  xxxd2065xxx  inhibited tumor expansion and metaspnas 兩 february 15, 2005 兩 vol. 102 兩 no. 7 兩 2529

reporter gene containing rxr␣ homodimer-responsive elements,
(trepal)2-tk-cat (26), was transfected with a rxr␣ expression
vector into cv-1 cells. treatment of cells with 9- xxxd2404xxx  strongly
induced reporter gene activity, whereas treatment with r- xxxd2065xxx 
did not (fig. 5a). however, when transfected cells were treated with
9- xxxd2404xxx , the addition of r- xxxd2065xxx  dose dependently reduced the
transcriptional activity of rxr␣.
we investigated whether r- xxxd2065xxx  inhibited transactivation of
endogenous rxr␣. an ra-response element (␤rare) in the
rar␤ promoter, which binds various rxr-containing heterodimers including rxr兾rar and rxr兾ppar␥ (26, 30, 31),
was transfected into zr-75–1 breast cancer cells. reporter activity
was induced by all-trans-ra, presumably because of binding of
endogenous rxr兾rar heterodimer. cotreatment with retodolac suppressed all-trans-ra-induced reporter activity in a
r- xxxd2065xxx  concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that retodolac inhibited transcriptional activity of endogenous rxr兾
rar heterodimers (fig. 5b). the transcriptional effect of retodolac on rxr␣ was confirmed by analyzing its effect on the
expression of rar␤. treatment of zr-75-1 cells with all-trans-ra
strongly induced the endogenous expression of rar␤ (fig. 5c),
which was completely inhibited by r- xxxd2065xxx , consistent with the
inhibitory effect of r- xxxd2065xxx  on the ␤rare reporter gene (fig.
5b). to determine the effect of r- xxxd2065xxx  on rxr兾ppar␥
heterodimer activity, zr-75-1 cells were stimulated with the
ppar␥ ligand ciglitazone and the rxr␣ ligand sr11237 in the
presence or absence of r- xxxd2065xxx  (fig. 5 d and e) (30). the
induction of endogenous rar␤ expression by the two drugs in
combination was abolished by r- xxxd2065xxx  cotreatment (fig. 5e).

tasis in the tramp model. by analogy, r- xxxd2065xxx  could be a
prospective agent for the treatment of human prostate cancer.
in the tramp model, treatment with the cox-2 selective agent
celecoxib or the r-enantiomer of the nsaid  xxxd2141xxx  resulted
in a significantly lower primary-tumor incidence and a reduced
incidence of metastases (34, 35). however, both of these drugs may
have exerted their effect by active cox inhibition because 15% of
the  xxxd3290xxx  was converted to the active cox inhibitor
s- xxxd2141xxx  by 2–4 h after administration. in contrast, the
stereoisomers of the conformationally rigid  xxxd2065xxx  molecule,
unlike all other approved racemic nsaids, cannot undergo chiral
transformation under physiologic conditions. indeed, s- xxxd2065xxx 
was undetectable in the plasmas of the mice given diets supplemented with the r-stereoisomer. hence, the cytostatic and antimetastatic effects of r- xxxd2065xxx  in the tramp model must be
attributed to the drug or to a metabolite.
the results presented here reveal an unexpected function of
rxr␣ as a mediator of the apoptotic effect of r- xxxd2065xxx . a recent
study (12) demonstrated that inhibition of prostate tumor growth
by r- xxxd2065xxx  was associated with initial enhancement of ppar␥
transcriptional activity, followed by degradation of the receptor
(12). however, ligand competition and direct binding assays using
ppar␥ recombinant protein failed to demonstrate any direct
binding of r- xxxd2065xxx  to ppar␥ (data not shown). because
ppar␥ activity depends on heterodimerization with rxr␣, it is
possible that modulation of ppar␥ and degradation by r- xxxd2065xxx 
is mediated by its binding to rxr␣. antagonists of rxr homodimers are known to function as agonists of rxr兾ppar␥
heterodimers (36, 37).
exactly how rxr␣ mediates the apoptotic effects of r- xxxd2065xxx 
remains unknown. it is unlikely that r- xxxd2065xxx  exerts its anticancer
effect through its inhibition of rxr␣ transactivation (fig. 5)
because many rxr␣ agonists potently inhibit the growth of
prostate cancer cells. however, the binding of rxr␣ by r- xxxd2065xxx 

could affect the function and stability of several nuclear receptors
that dimerize with rxr␣, including ppar␥ and  xxxg1603xxx .
our results demonstrate that r- xxxd2065xxx  induced apoptosis of
prostate cancer, but not normal epithelium (fig. 2 and 7). the
contrasting effects might be attributable to differences in rxr␣
posttranslational processing in cancer and normal cells (38). in this
regard, it was reported recently that rxr␣ was phosphorylated by
map kinase in surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma
samples but not in the corresponding noncancerous surrounding
tissues (39).
a recent population-based study of nsaid use and prostate
cancer revealed that the relative odds of prostate cancer among the
drug users was 0.2 (95% confidence interval 0.1–0.5) in men during
the eighth decade of life but only 0.9 in men during the sixth decade,
compared with similarly aged men who did not use nsaids (3).
the stronger effect among older men raised the possibility that
nsaids may prevent the progression of prostate cancer from
latent to clinical disease, rather than reduce the frequency of
primary lesions. the experimental results with r- xxxd2065xxx  in the
tramp model of prostate cancer display many parallels with the
human population data. thus, it is possible that r- xxxd2065xxx  could
represent a potential approach toward preventing the progression
of hormone refractory prostate cancer, especially in the very elderly
patients who are not candidates for cytotoxic therapy.
