background/aims: it has been proposed that, in acute liver failure, skeletal muscle adapts to become the principle
organ responsible for removal of blood-borne ammonia by increasing glutamine synthesis, a reaction that is catalyzed
by the cytosolic atp-dependent enzyme  xxxg913xxx . to address this issue,  xxxg913xxx  expression
and activities were measured in skeletal muscle of rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization.
methods:  xxxg913xxx  protein and gene expression were investigated using immunoblotting and semiquantitative rt-pcr analysis.  xxxg913xxx  activity and glutamine de novo synthesis were measured using,
respectively, a standard enzymatic assay and [13c]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
results:  xxxg913xxx  protein (but not gene) expression and enzyme activities were significantly upregulated leading to increased de novo synthesis of glutamine and increased skeletal muscle capacity for ammonia
removal in acute liver failure. in contrast to skeletal muscle, expression and activities of  xxxg913xxx  in the
brain were significantly decreased.
conclusions: these findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle adapts, through a rapid induction of glutamine
synthetase, to increase its capacity for removal of blood-borne ammonia in acute liver failure. maintenance of muscle
mass together with the development of agents with the capacity to stimulate muscle  xxxg913xxx  could provide
effective ammonia-lowering strategies in this disorder.

1. introduction
circulating ammonia concentrations in the 250–600 mm
range have consistently been reported in both experimental
and human acute liver failure (alf) and increased arterial
ammonia concentrations have been proposed as a predictor
of brain herniation and mortality in alf patients [1]. brain
ammonia may reach millimolar concentrations in alf
and such concentrations are well established to have
deleterious effects on cerebral metabolism and function [2].

under normal physiological conditions, ammonia detoxification relies almost exclusively on hepatic urea and
glutamine synthesis by periportal and perivenous hepatocytes, respectively. alf resulting from either toxic liver
injury or viral hepatitis results in a serious compromise of
hepatocyte integrity with consequent increases of circulating ammonia. a number of studies have provided evidence
that skeletal muscle becomes the major organ responsible
for removal of excess blood-borne ammonia in cirrhotic
patients [3] as well as in animal models of chronic liver
failure [4,5]. however, evidence that a similar response
occurs in alf is limited.
the objective of the present study was the assessment of
the capacity of skeletal muscle compared to brain (a second
organ with the potential to remove ammonia) to increase its
capacity to remove increased blood-borne ammonia in alf.

four approaches based upon molecular, spectroscopic and
hemodynamic measurements were undertaken namely (1)
measurement of  xxxg913xxx  (gs) mrna and
protein, (2) measurement of gs enzyme activities, (3)
measurement of ammonia and glutamine metabolic fluxes
and (4) direct spectroscopic measurement of de novo
glutamine synthesis in experimental alf. the devascularized rat model of alf was used for the studies described
since this model recapitulates the pathologic, metabolic and
neurologic features of human alf including sustained
hyperammonemia, loss of perivascular and periportal
hepatocytes and neurological manifestations such as brain
edema and encephalopathy [6]. studies were undertaken 6 h
following hepatic devascularization, prior to the onset of
brain edema or severe encephalopathy in order to minimize
confounding effects of these complications on cerebral
metabolism.

agreement between right and left kidney flow (%20% difference)
indicated adequacy of the microsphere injection.

2.3. tissue sampling for arterio-venous differences
following the microsphere procedure, femoral veins and arteries of the
right hind limb were exposed, arterial and venous blood samples were taken
by heparinized syringes (1 ml, 25g needle). arterial and venous blood of
0.5 ml was taken and immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma for
determination of arterio-venous differences for ammonia and glutamine
across the right hind limb.

2.4. measurement of plasma ammonia
plasma ammonia levels were measured using a commercial ammonia
test kit, based on an ion exchange method, followed by colorimetric
measurement of ammonia nitrogen with the bertholet phenate-hypochlorate reaction [12].

2.5. measurement of plasma glutamine
2. material and methods
2.1. animal surgery
male sprague–dawley rats (175–200 g) were anesthetized with
isoflurane, and an end-to-side portacaval anastomosis was performed
according to the guidelines of lee and fisher [7] and as previously
described [8]. total surgery time was !15 min. sham-operated control
rats, matched for weight, were similarly anesthetized and the portal vein
was clamped for 15 min. following surgery, all animals were individually
housed with free access to food and water under constant conditions of
temperature, humidity, and light cycles.
twenty-four hours after portacaval anastomosis or laparotomy, rats
were reanesthetized and subjected to hepatic artery ligation (hal) and all
animals were sacrificed 6 h after hal. all surgical procedures were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of canadian council of
animal care and were approved by animal research committee of chum.

2.2. measurement of organ blood flow
six hours post-hal or sham operation, animals were anesthetized with
isoflurane and body temperature was maintained at 37 8c with a cma 150
temperature controller (cma microdialysis, stockholm, sweden). a pe-10
catheter (intramedic clay adams, becton dickinson, sparks, md) was
placed in the right carotid artery and advanced into the left ventricle as
previously described [9]. correct positioning in the left ventricle was
verified by hemodynamic monitoring. a pe-50 catheter (intramedic clay
adams, becton dickinson, sparks, md) was placed in the left femoral
artery. total time for catheter placement was less than 15 min.
blood flow was measured using the radioactive microsphere technique
as previously described [10]. before sacrifice 1–1.2!105 microspheres
(15g2 mm) labeled with 85sr (perkin–elmer, boston, ma) in 0.7 ml of
saline 0.05% tween 80 (sigma aldrich, st louis, mo) were sonicated for
30 min and injected over a 15 s period into the left ventricle to determine
the hind limb muscle blood flow. just before injection, withdrawal of blood
from the femoral arterial catheter was started at a rate of 0.786 ml/min
(harvard pump, mills, ma) and collected in a heparinized glass syringe for
a total time of 1.25 min.
at sacrifice, left and right kidneys, and right hind limb muscles
(posterio-medial and lateral thigh, muscles) were rapidly removed,
weighed, pooled and counted. right and left renal blood flow and skeletal
muscle flow were calculated from the radioactivity measured in those
tissues using a gamma counter according to the formula described
previously [11]

glutamine concentrations were measured in femoral arterial and venous
plasma samples using a perkin–elmer reverse phase hplc system with
fluorescence detection and precolumn o-phthalaldehyde derivatization, as
previously described [13].

2.6. measurement of tissue  xxxg913xxx  activity
groups of rats were sacrificed by decapitation. brains were rapidly
removed and dissected on ice and 1 g of posterio-medial and lateral thigh
muscle was snap frozen. all tissue samples were stored at k70 8c until use.
 xxxg913xxx  (ec6.3.1.2) activity was measured in tissue
homogenates as previously described with minor modifications [14].
briefly, cerebral cortical and skeletal muscle samples were homogenised
(20 wt%/vol) using a teflon pestle in tris-edta buffer (ph 7.4), and
homogenates were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 10 min. the supernatant
(0.1 ml) was preincubated at 37 8c for 10 min in an assay mixture
containing 100 mm imidazole (ph 7.2), 12.5 mm mgcl2, 20 mm
 xxxd26xxx , 10 mm atp, 4 mm ammonium chloride, 13 mm
phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 units of pyruvate kinase and 0.16% triton
x-100. the reaction was started by adding 2 mci of [1-14c]-glutamate
(specific activity 60 mci/mmole, perkin–elmer, boston, ma) diluted with
cold glutamate to a final concentration of 50 mm for skeletal muscle and
20 mm for cerebral cortex. after incubation at 37 8c for 60 min (30 min for
muscle) the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml ice-cold water and the
mixture was immediately passed through a column (3 cm!0.7 cm)
containing anion exchange resin (dowex ag-1x8, acetate form).
[1-14c]-glutamate was quantitatively retained on the ion exchange column.
protein content of homogenates was determined by the method of lowry
[15]. enzyme activities were expressed as micromoles of glutamine formed
per hour per milligram of protein.

2.7. gs gene expression (rt-pcr)
2.7.1. rna extraction
total rna was extracted using tri reagent (mrc inc., ohio)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. putative contaminating dna was
eliminated by adding 100 u of rnase-free dnase i per 50 mg of total rna
at 37 8c for 1 h. purified rna was then extracted with phenol, precipitated
with ethanol and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. rna
samples were stored at k70 8c until use.

2.7.2. rt-pcr analysis
 xxxg913xxx  expression was measured by the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) using the same forward

n. chatauret et al. / journal of hepatology 44 (2006) 1083–1088
and reverse primer sequences and reactions conditions as previously
described [5].

2.8. gs protein analysis (western blot)
tissue samples were homogenised in ripa buffer (50 mm tris–hcl
(ph 8.0), 150 mm nacl, 0.1% sds, 1% triton x-100, 0.5% sodium
 xxxd1835xxx ), and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 1 mm edta,
0.1 mm pepstatin a, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 100 mg/ml
phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride. after centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min,
samples (50 mg protein) were boiled for 10 min in loading buffer (50 mm
tris–hcl, ph 6.8, 10% glycerol; 2% sds, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1%
bromophenol blue). proteins were resolved by 8% denaturing sdspolyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose filters.
ponceau staining was used to ensure equal protein loading. the membranes
were blocked for 2 h in tris-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk and
0.1% tween 20 (tbst), then incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody
directed against rat gs (transduction laboratories, lexington, ky). blots
were subsequently probed with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antiserum (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in) diluted
1/12,000 in the same buffer. after extensive washing with tbst, the
peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence using the
renaissance detection system (perkin–elmer, boston, ma) and quantified
by densitometric scanning.

2.9. 1h13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic
studies
groups of hepatic devascularized rats 6 h post-hal and their paired
sham-operated controls were administered [u-13]c-glucose (400 mg/kg,
i.p.; cambridge isotope laboratories, andover, usa) and were killed
exactly 20 min later by decapitation. arterial blood glucose levels were
continuously monitored and measured by mean of a glucometer using the
 xxxg1010xxx  method. glucose was administered subcutaneously
as needed to maintain normoglycemia. immediately after sacrifice, samples
of posterio-medial and lateral thigh muscle were snap-frozen, powdered
over liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 15 ml of a 12% pca solution at
0 8c using a motor-driven polished glass tube-teflon pestle homogenizer.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000g for 15 min; the supernatants
were placed in an ice bath, and neutralized to ph 7.0 with koh. the
precipitated kclo4 was sedimented by centrifugation (40,000g for 15 min),
and supernatants were lyophilized. the lyophilized pca extracts of muscle
tissue were redissolved in 0.6–0.8 ml deuterium oxide (d2o) and
centrifuged. prior to analysis the ph was adjusted to 7.0 with deuterium
chloride (dcl) and naod. 1h- and 13c nmr spectra were recorded
on bruker drx 600 or amx 360/am 360 spectrometers, operating at

1085

frequencies of 600 or 360 mhz for 1h, and 150.9 or 90.5 mhz for 13c
measurements.
1
h nmr spectra were recorded with a 5-mm h,c,n inverse triple
resonance probe, 400 accumulations, repetition time 15 s, spectral width
7183 hz (drx 600) or 3623 hz (am/amx 360), data size 16 k, zero
filling to 32 k. chemical shifts were referenced to lactate at 1.33 ppm.
13
c nmr spectra were recorded with a 5-mm 1h/13c dual probe,
10,000 accumulations, repetition time 2.5 s, composite pulse decoupling
with waltz-16, spectral width 47,619 hz (drx 600) or 20,833 hz
(am/amx 360), data size 32 k (16 k), zero filling to 64 k (32 k).
chemical shifts were referenced to the c-3 signal of lactate at 21.3 ppm.
glutamine concentrations (mmol/g tissue) were determined from fully
relaxed 1h nmr spectra of muscle extracts using (trimethylsilyl)propionic2,2,3,3,d4-acid as an external standard. fractional enrichment in glutamine
(c3 position) a measure of de novo glutamine synthesis was calculated
from 13c nmr spectra as previously described [16].

2.10. statistical analysis of data
data were analyzed by unpaired t-test. in cases where the variances
between compared groups were significantly different, the unpaired t-test
was modified with welch’s correction. the data were considered to be
significantly different at p!0.05.

ammonia across the hind limb of control animals were
accompanied by a significant release of glutamine (a–v
difference of k84.5g20.9 mm). this a–v difference for
glutamine was significantly increased 5-fold 6 h post-hal
in the alf group (k431.8g75.6 mm, p!0.01) (table 1).
3.4. effect of alf on muscle blood flow and on fluxes of
glutamine and ammonia across the hind limb
values for muscle blood flow are presented in the
table 1. variation of renal blood flow between the right and
left kidney were less than 20% and differences between the
two treatment groups were not significant indicating that the
procedure used was valid. there was a significant 188%
(p!0.01) increase in muscle blood flow 6 h post-hal
compared to sham operated control values.
uptake of ammonia across the hind limb was significantly increased in alf rats compared to sham-operated
controls (2.76g0.51 mmol/min per 100 g of muscle versus
0.22g0.11 mmol/min per 100 g; p!0.01) (table 1). glutamine release by the hind limb was concomitantly
increased from k0.91g0.33 mmol/min per 100 g of tissue
in control rats to k12.18g2.22 mmol/min per 100 g of
tissue in alf rats (p!0.001).

was unchanged following alf (data not shown).
changes in gs enzyme activities paralleled those of gs
protein: alf resulted in a 38% increase (p!0.05) in gs
enzyme activities in skeletal muscle 6 h post-hal
(fig. 1c). in contrast, a small but significant loss
(p!0.05) of gs activity was observed in the cerebral
cortex of alf animals at the same time point.
3.3. arterio-venous differences across skeletal muscle of
alf rats
sham operated control rats manifested significantly
lower ammonia concentrations in the femoral vein
compared to the femoral artery leading to an a–v difference
of 19.8g5.8 mm. this a–v difference was increased fivefold 6 h post-hal in the hal group (103.9g14.2 mm;
p!0.001) (table 1). these positive a–v differences for

h/13c nmr measurements revealed a significant 73.4%
(p!0.0001) increase in muscle glutamine levels 6 h posthal compared to sham-operated controls (fig. 2a and b).
increased muscle glutamine levels were accompanied by
significant 61% (p!0.01) increase in 13c glutamine
labeling from [u–13c]glucose indicating increased de
novo glutamine synthesis (fig. 2b).

4. discussion
results of the present study provide the first
unequivocal evidence in support of the notion that skeletal
muscle ammonia removal capacity is increased in alf.
this increase occurs as a consequence of an early posttranscriptional increase in expression of glutamine
synthetase (gs) a cytosolic enzyme (fig. 3) that is
predominantly responsible for ammonia removal by
skeletal muscle which is devoid of an effective urea
cycle.  xxxg913xxx  activities were increased by
40% early during the progression of alf and 13c nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies revealed that
this led to a significant increase in de novo synthesis of
glutamine by skeletal muscle. these findings confirm and
extend those of a previous study based upon a report of
increased ammonia removal and glutamine release in the
femoral vein in patients with alf [17].

glutamine) from glucose in alf rat muscle compared to shamoperated controls. values represent meangse from six rats per

in the present study, induction of gs protein and enzyme
activities led to a significant decrease in arterio-venous
differences for glutamine. muscle blood flow was concomitantly increased 2.7-fold consistent with the wellestablished hyperdynamic circulation characteristic of alf.
an accurate measurement of muscle ammonia and
glutamine fluxes requires measurement of arterio-venous
differences corrected for change in organ blood flow. such a
computation in the present study reveals a 12-fold uptake of
ammonia and a corresponding increase of muscle glutamine
release from skeletal muscle. that these findings represent
principally increased glutamine synthesis in skeletal muscle
was confirmed by studies with 13c nmr which showed
unequivocally that de novo synthesis of glutamine was

muscle and brain.

significantly increased. however, since glutamine de novo
synthesis is less than total glutamine release from muscle,
synthesis of glutamine from other sources of carbon than
glucose or muscle protein breakdown cannot be ruled out.
in contrast to skeletal muscle, results of the present study
clearly demonstrate that, gs protein expression and enzyme
activities in brain manifest small but statistically significant
reductions 6 h following hepatic devascularization. a
possible explanation for these findings has recently
emerged. exposure of cultured rat astrocytes (the cells
that express gs in the brain) to pathophysiologically
relevant (low millimolar) concentrations of ammonia results
in significant nitration of gs on the tyrosine residues [18]
leading to a significant reduction of gs activity. whether, or
not similar mechanisms are responsible for the loss of brain
gs expression in alf awaits the results of ongoing studies.
these findings of a lack of induction of brain gs in alf
again underscores the brain’s lack of an adequate protective
mechanism against ammonia toxicity.
in conclusion, alf resulting from hepatic devascularization in the rat results in an early increase in gs activity in
skeletal muscle, an increase that results from posttranscriptional change in gs protein. spectroscopic studies
confirm that this increase in activity results in increased de
novo synthesis of glutamine in the muscle and studies of
arterio-venous differences corrected for muscle blood flow
reveal significant increases of muscle glutamine release.
initial studies suggest that similar mechanisms occur in alf
patients. if confirmed, these findings suggest that the
maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and the use of agents
with the potential to stimulate gs activity in skeletal muscle
could be useful in the reduction of circulating ammonia and
the prevention of the cerebral complications of alf.
