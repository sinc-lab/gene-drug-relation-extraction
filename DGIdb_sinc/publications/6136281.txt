abstract-to

elucidate its mechanism of action, the effects of  xxxd2094xxx . a norcamphanethylamine
derivative, were studied in oirro on the release of newly accumulated dopamine in superfusion experiments using slices of rat corpus striatum and substantia nigra in comparison to  xxxd2746xxx  and
d-amphetamine. furthermore, the activity of  xxxd2094xxx  on biogenic amine uptake in synaptosome
preparations and on  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  activity was evaluated. as compared to d-amphetamine,
 xxxd2094xxx  exhibited roughly 10 times less dopamine releasing activity in striatal slices at concentrations at which dopamine uptake into synaptosomes was almost completely blocked although, at high
concentrations, what was probably non-specific release due to interactions with neuronal membranes
could also be demonstrated. in addition,  xxxd2094xxx , unlike d-amphetamine did not inhibit  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx . it is concluded that, at least in the models employed, the in uifro profile of  xxxd2094xxx 
is more similar to that of  xxxd2746xxx , a reportedly pure uptake inhibitor, than to d-amphetamine.

(z-ethyiamino-3-phenyl-norcamfencamfamine
phane) is a central stimulant [l] which, according
to behavioral studies and theoretical reasoning,
should act on central dopaminergic and, possibly,
also on noradrenergic neurons. until now, little was
reported about the neurochemical mechanism of
action of this drug. therefore, some basic mechanisms underlying neuronal transmission, i.e. uptake
and release, were studied in comparison with standard drugs whose mechanism of action is established.
materials and methods

male rats of the wistar strain, (wistar wu kisslegg, ivanovas gmbh, kisslegg/allgau)
of 1.50200 g body wt were used.  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  [ec
1.4.3.4. monoamine: oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating)] activity was determined in whole brain
homogenates with [r4c]tryptamine [2] ([side chain2-i4c] tryptamine, sp. act. 48.5 mci/mmole, new
england nuclear). for the release studies, corpus
striatum (caudate putamen and globus pallidus)
and substantia nigra were carefully dissected [3]
and slices made using a mcilwain tissue chopper
(3 x 3 x 0.3 mm
for
corpus
striatum
and
0.2 x 0.2 x 0.5 mm for substantia nigra). slices were
incubated
in 10-‘m ~~h]dopamine (]7-3h (n)]
dopamine, sp. act. zlsci/mmole,
new england
nuclear), in physiological salt solution for 30 min
under an atmosphere of 95% oz/s% c02. the
physiological salt solution, which was also used as
the superfusion medium, had the following composition (mmole/l.): nacl 118; kc1 4.8; cac12 1.3;

saturated with a mixture of 95% o$%
coz, the
ph was adjusted to 7.4 by addition of naoh. after
incubation,
superfusion at 37” was started with
drug-free medium at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. in most
cases, surface radioactivity from the slices was
removed after 15 min and a constant low base line
was reached. after this time, superfusion with
medium containing the appropriate concentrations
of the drug to be tested was initiated for 2 min,
thereafter superfusion was continued with drug free
medium until base line levets of radioactivity were
obtained again. fractions of 1 ml were collected for
radioactivity counting and residual radioactivity of
the slices was also determined. release is expressed
in percentage of the total radioactivity originally
present in the slices. all other experimental details
were as described in the lit. [4, s]. in vitro transmitter uptake into synaptosomes was studied using
crude whole brain synaptosomes (pz-fraction) with
[8-3h(n)]dopamine,
r.-[7-3h(n)]noradrenaline
and
[1,2-3h(n)]serotonin
(new england nuclear, sp.
act. 15, 3.8 and 21.4ci/mmole,
respectively) at a
fmal concentration of 2 x 10mxm [6,7].

results

as shown in table 1, d-amphetamine
in vitro
showed a 50% inhibition of  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  at
a concentration of 8 x 10m6m, whereas  xxxd2094xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx  showed virtually no inhibition.
at the highest concentration tested (3 x 10m4m),
 xxxd2094xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx  exhibited inhibitions
of only 18 and 25%, respectively, probably due to
unspecific interactions with the assay system.
table 2 summarizes the results of the release
experiments. in the striatum,  xxxd2094xxx  and
 xxxd2746xxx  at a concentration of 10ebm released
less than 0.1% of the total radioactivity. in contrast,
a marked d-amphetamine
induced 3h overflow at
this concentration was observed which amounted to
more than 1%. a similar difference in effects was
observed at 10m5m of about 0.5% for  xxxd2094xxx 
and  xxxd2746xxx  vs 12% for d-amphetamine. in the
substantia nigra, which seemed to be less sensitive
than the corpus striatum, d-amphetamine
again
showed pronounced release of about 2% of the
accumulated radioactivity. the similarities between
 xxxd2094xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx  were less striking
than in the corpus striatum;
for  xxxd2094xxx 
10m5m seemed
the substantia

to be the threshold concentration
in
nigra. at concentrations
of 10e4m

and above, both  xxxd2094xxx 
and  xxxd2746xxx 
showed marked release in both areas. however, for
comparable effects, the concentrations
were 1-2
orders of magnitude higher than with d-amphetamine and non-specific release reactions, due to damage of neuronal membranes, probably occur at high
concentrations.
as for the in vitro uptake inhibition of dopamine
and noradrenaline, all drugs were quite active (table

3), with  xxxd2746xxx  being the most potent followed
closely by  xxxd2094xxx  and d-amphetamine being
almost equipotent. at 10m6m, dopamine uptake was
inhibited by 82, 88 and 76% for  xxxd2094xxx ,
 xxxd2746xxx  and d-amphetamine,
respectively. as
compared to the effects on noradrenaline and dopamine uptake, at least 10 times higher concentrations
of all three drugs were necessary to inhibit serotonin
uptake by 50%.
discussion
these results clearly show marked, although quantitative, differences
between  xxxd2094xxx 
and d-

amphetamine. at concentrations of 10e6 and 10w5m,
which almost completely inhibited synaptosomal
dopamine uptake,  xxxd2094xxx  displayed about 10
times less dopamine releasing activity than damphetamine.  xxxd2746xxx , unlike d-amphetamine,
has been recently shown to be an uptake inhibitor
and not a releaser [4], at least as far as newly accumulated dopamine is concerned. our findings, using
a different model, are in line with this view. damphetamine,
on the other hand, is generally
accepted to be predominantly a releaser rather than
an uptake inhibitor [8,9] although, in the experiments with synaptosomes, d-amphetamine and  xxxd2094xxx  were almost equipotent. because of the
fact that the synaptosome and the slice preparations
cannot be compared directly due to different sensitivities, it could be argued that the dopamine
uptake inhibition at 10e6m of both  xxxd2094xxx 
and d-amphetamine is actually a release phenomenon giving only an apparent uptake inhibition.
from the dose-response
curve in the slice preparation, however, it is clear that artifactual uptake

dopamine uptake inhibiting versus dopamine releasing properties of fencanfamine
inhibition,
due to release, should play a far greater
role with d-amphetamine
than with  xxxd2094xxx .
therefore,
it can be concluded that, at least in vitro,
in concentrations
up to 10m5m the predominant
actions of  xxxd2094xxx 
seem to be uptake inhibition
and not release of dopamine,
in contrast
to dimportant
difference
amphetamine.
another
between d-amphetamine
and  xxxd2094xxx 
is the
lack of monoamine
oxidase inhibition of the latter.
