objective—nitrates are used widely in clinical practice. however, the mechanism underlying the bioactivation of nitrates
to release no remains unclear. recent animal data suggest that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg132xxx ) plays
a central role in nitrate bioactivation, but its role in humans is not known. we investigated the role of  xxxg132xxx  in the
vascular effects of nitroglycerin ( xxxd2741xxx ) in humans in vivo.
methods and results—forearm blood flow (fbf) responses to intra-arterial infusions of  xxxd2741xxx , sodium nitroprusside
(snp), and verapamil were measured in 12 healthy volunteers before and after  xxxg132xxx  inhibition by disulfiram. all
drugs caused a dose-dependent vasodilatation. however, only the response to  xxxd2741xxx  was significantly reduced after
disulfiram therapy (33% reduction in area under the curve [auc]; p⫽0.002). separately, 11 subjects of east asian
origin, with the loss-of-function glu504lys mutation in the  xxxg132xxx  gene, received intra-arterial  xxxd2741xxx , snp, and
verapamil. only the fbf response to  xxxd2741xxx  was lower in the volunteers with the glu504lys mutation compared with east
asian and non-asian wild-type control subjects (40% reduction in auc; p⫽0.02).
conclusions—the findings suggest that  xxxg132xxx  is involved in the bioactivation of  xxxd2741xxx  in humans in vivo but accounts
for less than half of the total bioactivation. this may be of clinical importance in patients with mutations in the  xxxg132xxx 
gene and in those taking drugs that inhibit  xxxg132xxx . (arterioscler thromb vasc biol. 2005;25:1891-1895.)

itrates have been used for ⬎100 years in the treatment of
angina, heart failure, and hypertension. several different
forms are in clinical use, including nitroglycerin ( xxxd2741xxx ),
isosorbide mononitrate, and  xxxd2402xxx . nevertheless, they all induce vasodilatation via no release and display
tolerance with continued use. the exact mechanism of
bioactivation of nitrates is unclear, but several candidate
enzymes have been suggested, including glutathione-stransferase,1 cytochrome p450 reductase,2 cytochrome p450,3
old yellow enzyme,4 and  xxxg2431xxx .5
recent work by chen et al identified mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg132xxx ) as an important enzyme involved in the bioactivation of nitrates in animals and suggested that nitrate tolerance may be caused by  xxxg132xxx 
inhibition.6 although the role of  xxxg132xxx  in the bioactivation
of nitrates has been confirmed by subsequent in vitro and in
vivo animal studies,7–9 its role in humans remains unclear.
interestingly, a common glu504lys point mutation in the
 xxxg132xxx  gene is present among people of east asian ethnic
origin and causes a low-activity form of the enzyme, with
heterozygotes having ⬇6.25% of normal  xxxg132xxx  enzyme
activity10 and homozygotes 0%. the mutation is associated
with flushing after alcohol ingestion, but its effect on the
bioactivation of nitrates has not been investigated.

n

to investigate the hypothesis that  xxxg132xxx  is involved in
the bioactivation of nitrates in humans, we designed 2 clinical
studies. in the first study, the  xxxg132xxx  inhibitor disulfiram
was administered to healthy volunteers, and the vasodilatory
response to  xxxd2741xxx  was measured before and after inhibition of
the enzyme. in the second study, the response to  xxxd2741xxx  in a
group of healthy volunteers heterozygous or homozygous for
the  xxxg132xxx  mutation was compared with that in homozygous
wild-type control volunteers. venous occlusion plethysmography was used to measure forearm blood flow (fbf)
responses to intra-arterial infusions of  xxxd2741xxx  in both studies.
the responses to 2 other control vasodilators that do not
undergo the same mechanism of bioactivation as  xxxd2741xxx ,
sodium nitroprusside (snp), which acts via direct release of
no, and verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, acting via an
no-independent mechanism, were also measured.

volunteers participated in study 1, which investigated the effect of
disulfiram on fbf response to  xxxd2741xxx . sixteen subjects participated in
study 2, which investigated the influence of  xxxg132xxx  genotype on
 xxxd2741xxx  response; these subjects did not receive disulfiram. all subjects
abstained from alcohol for the duration of the study (and for 10 more
days after the end of study 1). subjects were included in order of
enrollment. no further selection of subjects occurred. the protocol
was approved by the local research ethics committee and was
performed according to declaration of helsinki principles. all
subjects gave written informed consent before inclusion.

forearm blood flow
fbf was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography as described previously.11 a 27-gauge needle (cooper’s needle works)
attached to a 16-gauge epidural catheter (portex) was inserted into
the left brachial artery under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine; phoenix
pharma), and saline or drugs were infused at a rate of 1 ml/min.
after 30 minutes of 0.9% saline infusion, snp was infused at
incremental doses, followed by  xxxd2741xxx  and then verapamil. there was
a 30-minute washout period between drugs. measurements of fbf
were made for the last 3 minutes of each infusion period. blood
pressure and heart rate were recorded at regular intervals throughout.

drugs
infused drugs were freshly prepared aseptically, using 0.9% saline as
diluent. snp (faulding pharmaceuticals) was infused at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,
and 3.0 ␮g/min, an alcohol-free preparation of  xxxd2741xxx  ( xxxd2741xxx ; lipha
pharmaceuticals ltd) at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 ␮g/min, and verapamil ( xxxd3504xxx ; abbot laboratories ltd)  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 ␮g/min. each
dose was given for 6 minutes in a stepwise fashion.
disulfiram (600 mg; dumex-alpharma a/s) was taken orally for
2 days before the second visit of study 1. the dose of disulfiram
given was considered to be adequate to produce enzyme inhibition,
guided by the effects on inhibition of alcohol metabolism, which
start within 12 hours of the first dose and persist for up to 10 days
after the final dose.12

genotyping
blood samples were taken for dna analysis for  xxxg132xxx  genotype.
genotyping was performed for the exon 12 glu504lys single-nucleotide polymorphism using the restriction enzyme eco57i (fermentas; helena biosciences europe) as described previously.13

protocol
study 1: effects of  xxxg132xxx  inhibition
twelve subjects made 2 visits separated by 1 week. the study was
of single-blinded crossover design. at 48 and 24 hours before each
visit, subjects took either placebo (before visit 1) or disulfiram

(before visit 2). all subjects then received intra-arterial snp and
 xxxd2741xxx , and fbf was measured. in addition, 6 subjects also received
verapamil. the order of administration of placebo and disulfiram
was not randomized because of the unknown period of carryover
attributable to the irreversible effect of disulfiram on the aldh
enzyme (which requires new synthesis to recover function). compliance with disulfiram therapy was ensured by witnessing the first
dose.

study 2: effects of  xxxg132xxx  genotype
eleven subjects with the glu504lys  xxxg132xxx  mutation (9 heterozygotes and 2 homozygotes), all of whom were of east asian origin
and 5 east asian control subjects homozygous for the wild-type
allele, made a single visit and underwent a fbf study with
intra-arterial infusions of snp,  xxxd2741xxx , and verapamil, as described
above. all subjects received snp and  xxxd2741xxx ; 10 of the subjects with
the  xxxg132xxx  mutation and 4 of the wild-type controls also received
verapamil. genotyping of subjects was performed after the clinical
study to avoid bias.

statistics
results are expressed as the percentage change in ratio of fbf
(infused arm: control arm) from baseline and also as change in
absolute blood flow in the infused forearm from baseline (ml/100
ml per minute).11 area under the curve (auc) was calculated for
each subject and is expressed in arbitrary units (au). results were
analyzed using anova and paired or unpaired student’s t tests as
appropriate. post hoc tests were performed using the bonferroni
method. a p value of ⬍0.05 was considered significant. data are
presented as means⫾sem unless otherwise stated.

results
study 1: effects of  xxxg132xxx  inhibition
the mean age of the subjects was 30⫾7 years (7 females),
and all were normotensive (mean bp 117⫾10/79⫾5 mm hg;
table 1). genotyping confirmed that all 12 subjects were
homozygous for the wild-type  xxxg132xxx  allele.
there was a dose-dependent increase in fbf in response to
intra-arterial infusions of  xxxd2741xxx , snp, and verapamil at both
visits (table 2). the fbf response to intra-arterial  xxxd2741xxx  was
significantly reduced after disulfiram therapy compared with
placebo (p⫽0.002; anova; figure, b), but there was no
significant change in the response to either snp (p⫽0.8;
figure, a) or verapamil (p⫽0.5). overall, disulfiram reduced
auc significantly from 798⫾91 to 532⫾90 au for  xxxd2741xxx 
(p⫽0.004) but not for snp (p⫽0.7) or verapamil (p⫽0.2).

significantly different between visits, and there was no
change in fbf in the noninfused arm, blood pressure, or heart
rate during either study.

study 2: effects of  xxxg132xxx  genotype
eleven east asian subjects with the glu504lys mutation in the
 xxxg132xxx  gene were studied, and the results were compared
with those obtained in 5 east asian subjects homozygous for
the wild-type allele, and also to those obtained on the placebo
visit for the 12 non-asian wild-type homozygotes who
participated in study 1. the baseline characteristics of the
volunteers are summarized in table 1.
again, there was a dose-dependent increase in fbf in
response to intra-arterial infusions of  xxxd2741xxx , snp, and verapamil in all subjects (table 3). there was a significantly
blunted response to  xxxd2741xxx  in the east asian subjects with the
glu504lys mutation compared with the east asian wild-type
controls (figure, d; p⫽0.02; anova). however, there was
no difference in the response to snp (figure, c; p⫽0.8) or
verapamil (p⫽0.4). the response to  xxxd2741xxx  in the subjects with
the mutation was similar to that seen in the wild-type control
patients in study 1 after disulfiram therapy (figure).
in addition, the response to  xxxd2741xxx  was compared between
the east asian subjects with and without the glu504lys
 xxxg132xxx  mutation and the (non-asian) wild-type controls
from study 1. overall, there was a significant difference in the
response to  xxxd2741xxx  between the 3 groups (p⬍0.001). post hoc
analysis revealed that the response to  xxxd2741xxx  was significantly
blunted in the subjects with the  xxxg132xxx  mutation (p⫽0.005
versus east asian wild-type controls; p⬍0.001 versus nonasian wild-type controls) but was not significantly different

between the 2 wild-type control groups (p⬎0.9). the presence of the glu504lys mutation did not influence the response
to snp or verapamil.

discussion
the main findings of this study are that inhibition of  xxxg132xxx 
by disulfiram reduces the vasodilatory response to  xxxd2741xxx , and
that inherited reduction in  xxxg132xxx  activity is associated with
a similarly reduced response to  xxxd2741xxx . in contrast, the response to control vasodilators was unaffected by pharmacological or inherited reduction in  xxxg132xxx  activity. the reduction in response was 33% in the case of pharmacological
inhibition of  xxxg132xxx  using disulfiram and 40% in the case of
genetic reduction in  xxxg132xxx  activity on the basis of auc
calculations. these data suggest that  xxxg132xxx  is involved in
the bioactivation of  xxxd2741xxx  to no in vivo in humans; but
because there was incomplete inhibition of the  xxxd2741xxx  response
in both cases, it is likely that other enzymes or pathways are
also involved.
our results in humans are consistent with those reported in
previous animal studies. chen et al demonstrated a
concentration-dependent rightward shift in the  xxxd2741xxx  relaxation curve in isolated rabbit aortic rings after treatment with
 xxxg132xxx  inhibitors.6 they also demonstrated that in vivo
blood pressure responses to  xxxd2741xxx  could be attenuated by the
administration of the  xxxg132xxx  inhibitors chloral hydrate and
cyanamide to anesthetized rabbits and rats. difabio et al and
de la lande et al confirmed that inhibition of  xxxg132xxx  with
cyanamide caused a rightward shift in  xxxd2741xxx  relaxation curves
in isolated rat aorta.8,14 sydow et al also demonstrated a
reduction in  xxxd2741xxx  response in vessels treated with the
 xxxg132xxx  inhibitors cyanamide and acetaldehyde.7 most recently, cyanamide was shown to attenuate the increase in
coronary blood flow and decline in blood pressure and left

ventricular end-diastolic pressure produced by  xxxd2741xxx  in vivo
in anesthetized dogs.9 there is some debate over whether
 xxxg132xxx  inhibition is the mechanism responsible for nitrate
tolerance because varying results have been obtained to date
in animal studies.6 – 8,14 our current study was not designed to
investigate this issue. however, having now shown that
 xxxg132xxx  is involved in the bioactivation of  xxxd2741xxx  in humans,
the question of whether  xxxg132xxx  is also involved in the
development of nitrate tolerance would be an interesting field
to investigate in the future. indeed, it has been demonstrated
previously that human blood vessels made tolerant to  xxxd2741xxx 
demonstrate impaired  xxxd2741xxx  bioconversion.15 however,
whether this is attributable to  xxxg132xxx  inactivity is not
currently known.
although we demonstrated a significantly blunted response
to  xxxd2741xxx  in our studies, the effect was only partial. however,
this is in keeping with existing data suggesting that several
different enzymes are involved in the bioactivation of
 xxxd2741xxx .1–5 moreover, the relative importance of  xxxg132xxx  compared with other enzyme systems in the clinical response to
nitrates is not known, and it is possible that there may be
compensatory upregulation of other systems when  xxxg132xxx 
activity is reduced, either because of subacute pharmacological inhibition or genetically determined low activity. as
expected, snp and verapamil responses were unaffected by
reduced  xxxg132xxx  activity, supporting the view that they act
via different vasodilatory mechanisms and do not undergo the
same type of bioactivation as  xxxd2741xxx .
the glu504lys  xxxg132xxx  mutation is a guanine to adenine
base change at residue 1951 within exon 12 of the  xxxg132xxx 
gene on chromosome 12. this single-nucleotide polymorphism results in a  xxxd2431xxx  to lysine substitution in the
enzyme and is dominant, with homozygotes and heterozygotes for the mutation having a low-activity form of  xxxg132xxx .
subjects with the mutation typically experience facial flushing and a “disulfiram-like” reaction after ingestion of alcohol.10,16,17 the dominant-negative behavior of the allele is
attributed to tetramer formation by the enzyme, and the
activity of the enzyme in heterozygotes is estimated to be
6.25% of normal.10 as expected from the fact that the
mutation is dominant, there was no apparent difference
between the drug responses in the heterozygotes and the
homozygotes in the study, although the number of homozygotes in the study was too small to perform any separate
statistical analysis. it might be the case that other mechanisms
of bioactivation of  xxxd2741xxx  can be recruited when  xxxg132xxx 
activity is decreased for whatever reason, and this could be
particularly important in the case of homozygotes for the

glu504lys mutation. the mutation is rare in white populations
but relatively common in people of east asian ethnic origin,
including the japanese (up to 50% heterozygotes) and chinese (up to 17% heterozygotes).18,19 we chose to study
volunteers with the mutation as a natural example of reduced
activity of  xxxg132xxx .
our results suggest that people with the glu504lys mutation
in  xxxg132xxx  have a reduced vascular response to nitrates.
however, a review of the literature does not identify any
clinical problems with the use of nitrates in populations with
high incidences of the  xxxg132xxx  mutation, such as the japanese, although no published work seems to have tested this
directly. whether a systematic study might reveal a need for
higher doses of nitrates to manage conditions such as acute
coronary syndromes, heart failure, and hypertension in such
populations remains to be investigated.  xxxg132xxx  may also
play a role in the metabolism of circulating nitroso compounds such as the s-nitrosothiols, and genetic variation may
be of importance in determining resting vascular tone.
one study found that japanese men homozygous for the
glu504lys mutation had an increased risk of myocardial
infarction but concluded that this may be attributable to
influences of a low alcohol intake in these men on highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels.20 however, 2 studies
looking at the relationship between  xxxg132xxx  genotype and
hypertension in japanese populations have identified a negative association between hypertension and the glu504lys
mutation in men21 and no association in women. the negative
association was again thought to be secondary to reduced
alcohol intake because of alcohol intolerance in the group
with the glu504lys mutation.22
limitations of the current study include the fact that we
only measured local vascular effects of  xxxd2741xxx  and assessed the
effect of subacute, not chronic, inhibition of  xxxg132xxx . also,
we did not measure plasma levels of  xxxd2741xxx  or its metabolites
because this was a local infusion study using very low doses
of  xxxd2741xxx . disulfiram has been suggested to have some direct
vascular effects, including increasing blood pressure in some
patients. however, in our study, blood pressure and baseline
fbf were not significantly different between the 2 visits,
before or after disulfiram was given. moreover, in the current
study, there was no difference in the response to the control
vasodilators snp and verapamil after disulfiram therapy.
disulfiram was chosen as the  xxxg132xxx  inhibitor used in this
study because it has been used widely in humans in clinical
settings and has been administered previously to healthy
volunteers without ill effect. we did not test whether complete inhibition of  xxxg132xxx  was achieved by the dosages of

mackenzie et al
disulfiram given in this study. however, the effects of
disulfiram on alcohol metabolism start within 12 hours of the
first dose, and disulfiram causes irreversible inhibition of
 xxxg132xxx , and resynthesis of the enzyme is required to reverse
the effect, which takes several days.12 therefore, we assumed
that the dose of 600 mg of disulfiram daily for 2 days was
sufficient to achieve a high degree of inhibition of  xxxg132xxx .
in summary, we have shown that  xxxg132xxx  plays a role in
the bioactivation of  xxxd2741xxx  in humans in vivo. however,
because more than half of the response to  xxxd2741xxx  was maintained after pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg132xxx  and in
people with genetically determined low activity of  xxxg132xxx ,
this suggests that  xxxg132xxx  is unlikely to be the only enzyme
involved in the bioactivation of nitrates. the findings of this
study may be of clinical importance in patients with mutations in the  xxxg132xxx  gene and may also have implications for
patients taking drugs that inhibit  xxxg132xxx  who require nitrate
therapy. another important question that requires investigation in the future is whether  xxxg132xxx  is involved in the
development of nitrate tolerance in humans.
