abstract
 xxxd3078xxx  ( xxxd3078xxx ) is a novel melatonin receptor agonist currently under investigation for the treatment of insomnia. this
study describes the neurochemical and receptor binding characteristics of  xxxd3078xxx  in vitro.  xxxd3078xxx  showed very high aﬃnity
for human mt1 (mel1a) and mt2 (mel1b) receptors (expressed in chinese hamster ovary [cho] cells), and chick forebrain
melatonin receptors (consisting of mel1a and mel1c receptors) with ki values of 14.0, 112, and 23.1 pm, respectively, making the
aﬃnities of  xxxd3078xxx  for these receptors 3–16 times higher than those of melatonin. the aﬃnity of  xxxd3078xxx  for hamster brain
mt3 binding sites was extremely weak (ki: 2.65 mm) compared to melatonin’s aﬃnity for the mt3 binding site (ki: 24.1 nm). in
addition,  xxxd3078xxx  showed no measurable aﬃnity for a large number of ligand binding sites (including benzodiazepine receptors,
dopamine receptors, opiate receptors, ion channels, and transporters) and no eﬀect on the activity of various enzymes.  xxxd3078xxx 
inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in the cho cells that express the human mt1 or mt2 receptors. taken together,
these results indicate that  xxxd3078xxx  is a potent and highly selective agonist of mt1/mt2 melatonin receptors.

controlled by neuronal output from the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (scn) of the hypothalamus. the production of
melatonin in humans is concurrent with nocturnal sleep,
and the increase in melatonin levels in the evening
correlates with the onset of self-reported evening
sleepiness (akerstedt et al., 1979; zhdanova et al.,
1996) and an increase in sleep propensity (tzischinsky
et al., 1993).
melatonin exerts its action through membraneassociated receptors (for review, see vanecek, 1998).

initial radioligand studies revealed putative melatonin
receptors in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues
from vertebrate species. 2-[125i]melatonin binding sites
were originally deﬁned as high-aﬃnity binding sites
(picomolar aﬃnity, in chick and mammalian brains and
retina) and low-aﬃnity binding sites (nanomolar aﬃnity, in mammalian brains and peripheral organs)
(dubocovich, 1995; reppert et al., 1996). two highaﬃnity human melatonin receptors have been cloned:
mt1 (also designated as mel1a, reppert et al., 1994;
slaugenhaupt et al., 1995) and mt2 (also designated as
mel1b, reppert et al., 1995a) receptors nomenclatured
by iuphar (dubocovich et al., 2000). the mt1 and
mt2 receptors in the scn are thought to be involved in
the eﬀect of melatonin on circadian rhythms (dubocovich et al., 2003; von gall et al., 2002).
the low-aﬃnity binding site (mt3, dubocovich,
1995; paul et al., 1999) has a proﬁle that is completely
diﬀerent from those of the mt1 and mt2 receptors
(nosjean et al., 2000, 2001). it has recently been characterized as a melatonin-sensitive form of quinone
reductase 2 ( xxxg1593xxx ), an enzyme related to the detoxifying
enzyme  xxxg1592xxx  ( xxxg1592xxx , ec
1.6.99.2), and it shows a wide tissue distribution,
including kidney, liver, brain, heart and skeletal muscle
in mammals.
because of melatonin’s involvement in natural sleep,
the use of exogenous melatonin has been examined as
a treatment for sleep disorders. exogenous melatonin
has been shown to have a direct sleep-promoting action
(zhdanova et al., 1995, 2001), however, it has not been
shown to have any consistent eﬀect on total sleep time
or sleep eﬃciency (hughes et al., 1998; zhdanova and
wurtman, 1997). also, melatonin may have therapeutic
eﬀects on circadian rhythm sleep disorders including jet
lag and shift-work sleep disorder (arendt et al., 1995;
sharkey et al., 2001). the secretion of endogenous
melatonin declines with aging, and this may be related
to the sleep-wake rhythm disturbance in elderly people
(mirmiran et al., 1992; skene et al., 1990). abnormal
decreases in nocturnal melatonin have also been
observed in patients with alzheimer’s disease, another
population prone to sleep disturbances (mirmiran et al.,
1992; skene et al., 1990).
 xxxd3078xxx , (s )-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahyrdo-2h-indeno
[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide ( xxxd3078xxx ), is a
novel melatonin receptor agonist under investigation
for the treatment of insomnia. in animal models,
 xxxd3078xxx  has a sleep-promoting action and does not
appear to cause learning, memory, or motor function
impairment, or to have rewarding properties (miyamoto
et al., 2003, 2004). in a clinical study,  xxxd3078xxx 
decreased latency to persistent sleep and increased total
sleep time and sleep eﬃciency in subjects with primary
chronic insomnia as measured by polysomnography
(erman et al., 2003). the present study was done to

characterize the neurochemical and receptor binding
properties of  xxxd3078xxx  as a way to distinguish it from
melatonin and other sleep agents that act at diﬀerent
receptors.

2. materials and methods
2.1. high-aﬃnity melatonin receptor binding assays
receptor binding assays were based on the methodology of rivkees et al. (1989) with minor modiﬁcation.
for the chick melatonin receptor binding assay, forebrains from 7-day-old male chicks (komatsu, japan)
were homogenized with 20–30 volumes of ice-cold 50
mm tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.7 at 25  c) and centrifuged
at 44 000!g for 10 min at 4  c. the resulting pellet was
washed twice and stored at 30  c until use in the
binding assays. test compound and 80 pm 2-[125i]melatonin were mixed with the thawed homogenate in
a total volume of 500 ml and incubated at 25  c for 90
min. the reaction was terminated by addition of 3 ml
of ice-cold buﬀer followed by vacuum ﬁltration on
a whatman gf/b. the ﬁlter was washed twice and
radioactivity was counted by a g-counter. nonspeciﬁc
binding was deﬁned as the binding in the presence of 10
mm melatonin.
for the human  xxxg1476xxx  binding assay, cdna
encoding the human mt1 gene was introduced into
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. a cell line
stably expressing mt1 receptors (cho-hmelr7) was
selected and cultured in eagle’s minimum essential
medium-a (mem-a) supplemented with 10% dialyzed
fetal bovine serum (dfbs) under a 5% co2/95% air
atmosphere. cells were harvested at conﬂuence in
ca2c–mg2c free hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  containing 5 mm edta and collected by centrifugation.
cells were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm tris–hcl
buﬀer (ph 7.7 at 25  c), washed twice, pelleted, and
stored at 30  c until the binding assays were
conducted. test compound and 40 pm 2-[125i]melatonin
were mixed with the thawed homogenate in a total
volume of 1 ml and incubated at 25  c for 150 min.
the reaction was terminated by addition of 3 ml of icecold buﬀer followed by vacuum ﬁltration on a whatman
gf/b. the ﬁlter was washed twice and radioactivity was
counted by a g-counter. nonspeciﬁc binding was
deﬁned as the binding in the presence of 10 mm
melatonin.
for the human  xxxg1477xxx  binding assay, cho
cells were transfected with a pcmv-human mt2
receptor expression vector using lipofectamine reagent (invitrogen). a cell line stably expressing mt2
receptors was selected and cultured in mem-a supplemented with 10% fbs and 300 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx 
(invitrogen) under a 5% co2/95% air atmosphere.

k. kato et al. / neuropharmacology 48 (2005) 301–310

cells expressing mt2 receptors were harvested at
conﬂuence in dulbecco’s phosphate-buﬀered saline
and collected by centrifugation. cells were homogenized
in ice-cold 50 mm tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.6 at 25  c),
washed twice, pelleted, and stored at 80  c until the
binding assays were conducted. test compound was
mixed with the thawed homogenate and 280 pm
2-[125i]melatonin in a total volume of 1 ml and
incubated at 25  c for 150 min. the reaction was
terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold buﬀer
followed by vacuum ﬁltration on a whatman gf/b.
the ﬁlter was washed twice and radioactivity was
counted by a g-counter. nonspeciﬁc binding was deﬁned
as the binding in the presence of 100 mm melatonin.
the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) was calculated using the nonlinear logistic regression analysis.
the dissociation constant of the compound for the
receptor (ki) was calculated using following equation:
ki zic50 =ð1cl=kd þ
where l and kd represent the concentration and the
dissociation constant of 2-[125i]melatonin in the binding
assay, respectively.
2.2. mt3 binding assay
the procedure for this binding assay was based on
the methodology of niles et al. (1987) with minor
modiﬁcation. brains were dissected from 7- to 8-weekold male syrian hamsters (slc, japan) and stored in
0.32 m sucrose at 30  c until use. the brain tissue was
homogenized with 20–30 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm
tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.4 at 4  c) and centrifuged at
48 000!g for 10 min at 4  c. the pellet was washed
twice and suspended in buﬀer for use in the binding
assay. test compound (25 ml) was mixed with hamster
brain homogenate and 100 pm 2-[125i]melatonin in
a total volume of 250 ml and incubated at 4  c for 60
min. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3
ml of ice-cold buﬀer followed by vacuum ﬁltration on
a whatman gf/b. the ﬁlter was washed twice and
radioactivity was counted using a g-counter. nonspeciﬁc binding was deﬁned as the binding in the
presence of 100 mm melatonin. ki values were calculated
as described above.
2.3. camp production in cho cells expressing
the human mt1 or  xxxg1477xxx 
a single clone of cho-hmelr7 exhibiting speciﬁc
2-[125i]melatonin binding and the inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production by melatonin
(cho-hmelr7-58) was selected by the limiting dilution
method and cultured in mem-a/10% dfbs, harvested
at conﬂuence by trypsin/edta treatment and seeded

303

at 5!104 cells/well in 12-well plates (iwaki glass).
after culturing for 3 days, cells were washed twice with
1 ml of modiﬁed hanks’  xxxd2988xxx 
(mhbss: hbss containing 10 mm hepes–na [ph
7.3] instead of 4.16 mm nahco3) at 37  c, and 0.5
ml of mhbss containing 100 mm 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine and a test compound were added
followed by preincubation at 37  c for 6 min. after
this, 10 ml of 50 mm  xxxd1742xxx  in mhbss was added
(ﬁnal concentration 1 mm), and the cells were incubated an additional 15 min. the reaction was
terminated by the addition of 50 ml of 55% perchloric
acid. a 200-ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was
neutralized with 100 ml of 1.6 m naoh and assayed
for camp content using a camp [125i] assay system
(amersham pharmacia biotech ltd. buckinghamshire,
uk).
a subclone (cho- xxxg1845xxx  #13), which shows inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production by
melatonin, was selected using the limiting dilution
method in the presence of 500 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx . chohmt2 #13 was cultured in mem-a containing 10%
fbs and 500 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx , harvested at conﬂuence
by trypsin–edta treatment and seeded at 4!104
cells/well in 96-well plates (asahi techno glass,
tokyo, japan). after culturing for 1 day, cells were
washed twice with 200 ml modiﬁed hanks’ balanced
salt solution (hbss–hepes, hbss containing 20
mm hepes buﬀer [ph 7.3]); 215 ml of hbss–
hepes containing 10 mm  xxxd2388xxx 
(hbss– xxxd2388xxx ) and a test compound were added
followed by preincubation at 37  c for 6 min. after
this, 10 ml of  xxxd1742xxx  solution in hbss– xxxd2388xxx  was
added (ﬁnal concentration 1 mm), and the cells were
incubated for 15 min. the reaction was terminated by
the addition of 25 ml of lysis buﬀer and a 100-ml
aliquot of the reaction mixture was assayed for camp
content using a camp enzyme immunoassay biotark
system (amersham pharmacia biotech ltd. buckinghamshire, uk).
the ic50 was calculated using the nonlinear logistic
regression analysis.

2.4. assays for other receptors and enzymes
eﬀects of  xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin on various
receptors, ion channels and transporters were evaluated
using standardized assay protocols (mds pharma
services, taipei, taiwan). receptors, transporters and
ion channels tested are shown in table 1. initially,
 xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin were tested for inhibition of
binding  xxxd1891xxx  mm. further investigation was performed
using multiple concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin to calculate the ic50 value when inhibition exceeded
50%  xxxd1891xxx  mm.

3.1. aﬃnity for the human mt1/mt2 receptors
and chick melatonin receptors
the speciﬁc binding of 2-[125i]melatonin in the chick
forebrain, which contain the chick mel1a and mel1c
receptors (reppert et al., 1995b), was saturable. the
scatchard plot of the saturation isotherm using ligand
concentrations ranging from 10 to 160 pm revealed
high-aﬃnity binding sites with a kd value of 24.7g2.3
pm and a bmax of 13.2g0.9 fmol/mg protein (three
experiments). this was also the case for human mt1
receptors in cho-hmelr7, with a kd value of 15.0g3.0
pm and a bmax of 555g114 fmol/mg protein (three

experiments), determined with ligand concentrations
ranging from 5 to 80 pm. human mt2 receptors
expressed in cho cells showed lower aﬃnities than
those of human mt1 receptors, and its kd value and
bmax were 328g12 pm and 133g2 fmol/mg protein,
respectively (three experiments) determined with ligand
concentrations ranging from 99 to 6350 pm.
the aﬃnities of the tested compounds for these
receptors are shown in table 3. the aﬃnity of  xxxd3078xxx 
for the chick melatonin receptors was found to be very
high, with a ki value of 23.1 pm, which is comparable to
that of  xxxd2377xxx  and 16 times higher than that of
melatonin.  xxxd70xxx , a precursor of melatonin with
high aﬃnity for the mt3 binding site, showed very low
aﬃnity for high-aﬃnity melatonin receptors including the
mt1, mt2, and chick melatonin receptors.  xxxd3000xxx , an
a1 antagonist with high aﬃnity for the mt3 binding site
(niles et al., 1987; pickering and niles, 1990), showed no
aﬃnity for the high-aﬃnity melatonin receptors.
all compounds showed 2- to 4-fold higher aﬃnity for
the human  xxxg1476xxx  than for the chick melatonin
receptors with almost the same order of potency. the
aﬃnity of  xxxd3078xxx  for human mt1 was comparable to
that of  xxxd2377xxx  and 6 times higher than that of
melatonin (fig. 2 and table 3).  xxxd3078xxx  and
 xxxd2377xxx  also showed high aﬃnity for the

chick forebrain melatonin receptors consist of the chick mel1a and mel1c receptors. each value represents the mean of three experiments with the
s.e.m.

human  xxxg1477xxx  with ki values of 112 and 188 pm,
respectively (fig. 2 and table 3). compared to their
aﬃnities for the  xxxg1476xxx ,  xxxd3078xxx  and 2iodomelatonin showed lower aﬃnity for the mt2
receptor.  xxxd70xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx  showed little or
no aﬃnity for human mt1 and mt2 receptors.

3.2. aﬃnity for the mt3 binding site
the speciﬁc binding of 2-[125i]melatonin to the
hamster mt3 binding site was saturable. the scatchard
plot of the saturation isotherm using ligand concentrations ranging from 100 to 2500 pm revealed a single
binding site component with a kd value of 900g89 pm
and a bmax of 80.3g6.6 fmol/mg protein (three experiments). the aﬃnity of the radioligand for these
receptors was about 1/40 of that for the chick melatonin
receptors (fig. 3).
the aﬃnities of compounds for the hamster mt3
binding site are summarized in table 4.  xxxd3078xxx 
showed very low aﬃnity for the mt3 binding sites with
a ki value of 2.65 mm, which was 1/115 000 of its aﬃnity
for the chick melatonin receptors. in contrast, both
melatonin and  xxxd2377xxx  demonstrated high
aﬃnities for the mt3 binding site. the aﬃnity of
 xxxd3078xxx  for the mt3 site was 1/110 that of melatonin
and 1/2750 that of  xxxd2377xxx .  xxxd70xxx  and
 xxxd3000xxx  also showed high aﬃnities for the mt3 binding
site, as reported previously (dubocovich, 1995; niles
et al., 1987). the aﬃnities of these two compounds were
higher than that of melatonin for the mt3 binding site
and higher than the aﬃnities of these compounds for the
chick melatonin receptors. our results indicate that
 xxxd3078xxx  is highly selective for the high-aﬃnity
melatonin receptors in contrast to other compounds.

cell homogenate of cho cells expressing the human  xxxg1476xxx 
were incubated with 40 pm 2-[125i]melatonin and various concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin,  xxxd2377xxx  and  xxxd70xxx .
nonspeciﬁc binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm
melatonin. (b) cell homogenate of cho cells expressing the human
 xxxg1477xxx  were incubated with 280 pm 2-[125i]melatonin and
various concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin,  xxxd2377xxx  and
 xxxd70xxx . nonspeciﬁc binding was determined in the presence of
100 mm melatonin.

the stimulation of cho-hmelr7-58 cells with 1 mm
 xxxd1742xxx  elevated camp content to 6- to 12-fold above
basal level.  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin, and  xxxd2377xxx 
inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4a). table 5
shows ic50 values of these compounds. these results
indicate that  xxxd3078xxx  is a potent agonist to human
 xxxg1476xxx , as potent as  xxxd2377xxx  and about
3.7 times more potent than melatonin.

fig. 3. competition by various ligands for 2-[125i]melatonin binding to
the mt3 binding site in hamster brain. hamster brain homogenate was
incubated with 100 pm 2-[125i]melatonin and various concentrations of

level.  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin, and  xxxd2377xxx 
inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4b). table 6
shows ic50 values of these compounds.  xxxd3078xxx  and
 xxxd2377xxx  potently inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp production in the cells with ic50 of 53.4 and 60.7
pm, respectively. melatonin showed moderate inhibition with ic50 of 904 pm. these results indicate that
 xxxd3078xxx  is an agonist to human  xxxg1477xxx , as
potent as  xxxd2377xxx  and about 17 times more
potent than melatonin.
3.4. eﬀects on various receptors and enzymes
 xxxd3078xxx  did not show signiﬁcant (o50%)
inhibition of the binding of any receptors, transporters,
and ion channels listed in table 1  xxxd1891xxx  mm, including
monoamine receptors, opioid receptors, central benzodiazepine receptors, and dopamine transporters. melatonin caused no signiﬁcant inhibition of the binding of
almost all receptors, except for  xxxg1108xxx , for
which the ki value was 5.6 mm. moreover,  xxxd3078xxx  and
melatonin had no eﬀect on the activity of any enzymes
listed in table 2  xxxd1891xxx –1000 mm.

in the present study,  xxxd3078xxx  demonstrated high
aﬃnity to high-aﬃnity melatonin receptors, including
human mt1 and mt2 receptors. the ki of  xxxd3078xxx 
was 3–16 times higher than that of endogenous ligand
melatonin, and this is consistent with pharmacological
eﬀects of  xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin in vivo. previously,
we showed that  xxxd3078xxx  exerts a sleep-promoting
action in freely moving cats (miyamoto et al., 2004) and
accelerates re-entrainment of circadian rhythm of
running-wheel activity following an abrupt phaseadvance in rats. these eﬀects were more potent than
those of melatonin (data not shown).
 xxxd3078xxx  inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in cho cells expressing the human mt1 and
mt2 melatonin receptors, which indicates that  xxxd3078xxx  is an mt1/ xxxg1477xxx  agonist. while melatonin
inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production with
an ic50 value comparable to the ki value for the mt1
receptor binding,  xxxd3078xxx  and  xxxd2377xxx 
showed ic50 values slightly higher than the ki value.
this suggests that the endogenous ligand melatonin has
slightly higher eﬃcacy in the stimulation of the mt1
receptors than the synthetic ligands. it has been shown
that activation of the mt1 or  xxxg1477xxx  by
melatonin inhibits  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp formation
via pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein (morgan et al.,
1989; reppert et al., 1994, 1995a), which is consistent
with the present results. melatonin also inhibits
folskolin-stimulated camp-dependent activation of
 xxxg1836xxx  activity (morgan et al., 1994) and
phosphorylation of camp response element binding
protein (mcnulty et al., 1994). thus, a camp-dependent signal transduction cascade may be involved in
 xxxd3078xxx -induced pharmacological eﬀects.
activation of mt1 and mt2 receptors in the scn are
closely related to melatonin-induced hypnotic and
chronobiotic eﬀects (for review, see dubocovich et al.,
2003; von gall et al., 2002). in mice with a target
deletion of the  xxxg1476xxx , the acute inhibitory
eﬀect of melatonin on neuronal ﬁring rate in the scn
was abolished, while the melatonin-mediated phaseshifting eﬀect appeared normal (liu et al., 1997). the

suppression of the neuronal activity by melatonin might
be important deﬁning the scn sensitivity to entraining
stimuli, and in diurnal species may contribute to the
regulation of sleep (von gall et al., 2002). on the other
hand,  xxxg1477xxx  antagonists have been shown to
block melatonin-mediated phase advances of circadian
rhythms (dubocovich et al., 1998).
in mammals, melatonin regulates reproductive and
neuroendocrine functions (reiter, 1980; malpaux et al.,
2001). although most studies on the reproductive
function of melatonin have been focused in the
hypothalamus and pituitary, recently it has been shown
that mt1 and mt2 melatonin receptors are expressed in
rat ovaries dependent on the stage of the estrous cycle
and may aﬀect steroidogenesis through camp mediated
signaling (soares et al., 2003). furthermore, the mt1
receptors have been shown to express in normal and
malignant human breast tissue, and melatonin inhibits
the growth of breast cancer cells (dillon et al., 2002;
yuan et al., 2002). it has also been reported that
melatonin regulates vascular tone. the mt1 and mt2
melatonin receptors are present in rat caudal arteries

(masana et al., 2002). activation of the mt1 receptors
facilitate adrenergic vasoconstriction (krause et al.,
1995; ting et al., 1997), while activation of the mt2
receptors mediate vasorelaxation (masana et al., 2002).
 xxxd3078xxx  shows high aﬃnity for the mt1 and mt2
receptors; thus, these potential peripheral eﬀects of
 xxxd3078xxx  should be investigated by further studies.
 xxxd3078xxx  showed a low aﬃnity for mt3, the
binding site identiﬁed as human  xxxg1593xxx  (nosjean et al.,
2000). good correlation between the amount of the
mt3 binding sites and  xxxg1593xxx  reductase activity has been
observed in various organs (including brain, liver,
kidney and heart) in the mouse and dog, although
apparent discrepancies were seen in monkey tissues
(nosjean et al., 2001). in a previous study (miyamoto
et al., 2003), we found that melatonin and n-acetyl-5ht, a precursor of melatonin biosynthesis and a potent
ligand of the mt3 binding site (popova and dubocovich, 1995), potentiated the diazepam-induced deﬁcit of
rota-rod performance in mice, whereas  xxxd3078xxx  did
not show any such eﬀect, suggesting that this action of
melatonin might be related to action at the mt3 binding
site. correlation between melatonin- and n-acetyl-5ht-induced aggravation of diazepam-induced motor
deﬁcits and their eﬀect on  xxxg1593xxx  activity is not clear. the
potential for this action of melatonin to cause unfavorable side eﬀects when used clinically is not clear;
however, these facts suggest that a selective mt1/mt2
agonist would be preferable to a non-selective melatonin
agonist for clinical treatment of sleep disturbance.
the neurochemical proﬁle of  xxxd3078xxx , which
includes a negligible aﬃnity for central benzodiazepine
receptors, opioid receptors, dopamine transporters, and
other receptors and enzymes tested even at high
concentrations, is consistent with results of our previous

pharmacological studies.  xxxd3078xxx  had no eﬀects on
motor function tested by rota-rod performance in mice
or on learning and memory as demonstrated by the
water-maze task and delayed matching to position tasks
in rats (miyamoto et al., 2003). we have studied the
abuse potential of  xxxd3078xxx  by the place-preference test
in rats and found that the compound, like melatonin,
has a very low potential for abuse, unlike morphine and
benzodiazepines (miyamoto et al., 2003).
in conclusion,  xxxd3078xxx  is a potent and highly
selective mt1/mt2 melatonin receptor agonist. its
neurochemical and binding characteristics suggest that
it has the potential to be a useful therapeutic agent for
the treatment of insomnia.
