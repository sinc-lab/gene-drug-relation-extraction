northern analysis was performed with 2 yg of poly(a)" rna prepared from c3h10t1/2 cells that were either untreated (day 0) or treated for 7
days with 1 x 10 ° m  xxxd3147xxx . blots were hybridized with **p-labeled ap2,  xxxg434xxx , ppar y, and  xxxg861xxx  cdna probes. an equivalent amount
of intact rna was run in each lane as indicated by the  xxxg861xxx  cdna probe. exposure times were 1.5, 24, 48, and 7 h for ap2,  xxxg434xxx , ppary,
and  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) blots, respectively.

and northern analysis using the adipocyte-specific markers
ap2 and  xxxg434xxx  (fig. 4c). ppary expression levels were in-
creased approximately 3-fold in response to treatment with
 xxxd3147xxx  (fig. 4c). significant adipocyte differentiation was
seen at concentrations of  xxxd3147xxx  as low as 1 x 10 7 m (data
not shown). these data provide evidence that ligand-mediated
activation of ppary is sufficient to initiate the adipogenic
signaling cascade in a mesenchymal stem cell line. further-
more, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the
reported adipogenic effects of several thiazolidinediones on
preadipocyte cell lines (14-17).

thiazolidinediones are insulin sensitizers that significantly
reduce glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in animal models of
niddm and obesity (13). our results suggest that ppary may
be a target for the antidiabetic effects of these agents. how
might activation of an adipocyte-specific transcription factor
account for these diverse therapeutic effects? in recent years
there has been a growing awareness that niddm is not only a
derangement of glucose homeostasis, but is also characterized
by elevated levels of circulating lipids. although the mecha-
nism is poorly characterized, increases in lipid levels have been
shown to interfere with glucose disposal (reviewed in ref. 28).
thus, activation of ppary in adipose may affect glucose usage
in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, the primary site of
glucose disposal, through an indirect mechanism involving
modulation of lipid levels. alternatively, activation of ppary
may regulate signaling molecules secreted by adipose such as
 xxxg2296xxx -a or the ob gene product (29, 30). these
secreted products could, in turn, modulate glucose metabolism
in other tissues.

in summary, our demonstration that an adipogenic thiazo-
lidinedione is a high affinity ligand for ppary provides com-
pelling evidence that this nuclear receptor plays a critical role
in adipogenesis. clearly, an understanding of the ppary sig-
naling cascade may lead to insights into the molecular mech-
anisms regulating energy homeostasis and the defects under-
lying obesity and niddm.

thiazolidinedione derivatives are antidiabetic agents
that increase the insulin sensitivity of target tissues in
animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes melli-
tus. in vitro, thiazolidinediones promote adipocyte dif-
ferentiation of preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cell
lines; however, the molecular basis for this adipogenic
effect has remained unclear. here, we report that thia-
zolidinediones are potent and selective activators of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (ppary), a
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily recently
shown to function in adipogenesis. the most potent
of these agents,  xxxd3147xxx , binds to ppary with a k,
of approximately 40 nm. treatment of pluripotent
c3h10t1/2 stem cells with  xxxd3147xxx  results in efficient
differentiation to adipocytes. these data are the first
demonstration of a high affinity ppar ligand and pro-
vide strong evidence that ppary is a molecular target
for the adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones. fur-
thermore, these data raise the intriguing possibility that
ppary is a target for the therapeutic actions of this
class of compounds.

 

adipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a critical
role in energy homeostasis. their primary role is to store tri-
glycerides in times of caloric excess and to mobilize this reserve
during periods of nutritional deprivation. adipocytes are de-
rived from a multipotent stem cell of mesodermal origin that
also gives rise to the muscle and cartilage lineages. studies of
the adipocyte differentiation program have been facilitated by
the availability of established mesenchymal and preadipocyte
cell lines that can be induced to differentiate upon treatment
with mixtures of hormonal stimulants (reviewed in ref. 1).

adipocyte differentiation is characterized by a coordinate
increase in adipocyte-specific gene expression. in most cases,
these increases can be accounted for by activation of gene
transcription. thus, considerable effort has been focused on the
identification of transcription factors that regulate adipocyte-
specific genes. recently, an orphan member of the nuclear

receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors,
designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y
(ppary),' was shown to be expressed in an adipose-specific
manner and its expression induced early during the course of
differentiation of several preadipocyte cell lines (2, 3). subse-
quent studies revealed that forced expression of ppary in
fibroblasts resulted in adipocyte differentiation; this differen-
tiation was significantly enhanced in the presence of weak
ppary activators (4). these data demonstrated that ppary
plays a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade.

ppar; is one of a subfamily of ppars encoded by independ-
ent genes (5). to date, three mammalian ppars, designated
 xxxg1805xxx , ppary, and nuc-1, have been identified (6-10).
ppars regulate gene expression by binding to dna sequence
elements termed ppar response elements. ppar response
elements have been identified in the regulatory regions of a
number of genes encoding enzymes that modulate lipid metab-
olism, indicating a physiological role for the ppar family in the
regulation of lipid homeostasis (reviewed in ref. 11). ppars
have been shown to be activated to various degrees by micro-
molar concentrations of long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  and a structur-
ally diverse group of compounds termed peroxisome prolifera-
tors that includes the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs (5-9,
12). however, as no binding of these compounds to the ppars
has been reported, ppars have remained “orphan” receptors.

to further examine the role of ppary in adipocyte differen-
tiation, we sought to identify activators of ppary. we report
here that a class of compounds, termed thiazolidinediones (13),
are ppary-selective ligands. thiazolidinediones are known to
have marked adipogenic effects on preadipocyte and mesenchy-
mal stem cells in vitro (14-17) and dramatic antidiabetic ef-
fects in animal models of niddm (13, 18). our data provide
strong evidence that ppary is the molecular target for the
adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones and, furthermore, sug-
gest that ppary may be the target for the antidiabetic actions
of this class of compounds.

materials and methods

plasmids—gal4-ppar chimera expression constructs contain the
translation initiation sequence and amino acids 1-76 of the glucocorti-
coid receptor fused to amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription
factor gal4, including the dna binding domain, in the psg5 expres-
sion vector (stratagene). cdnas encoding amino acids 167—468, 138-
440, and 174-475 of murine  xxxg1805xxx , nuc-1, and ppary]1 (ref. 8) were
amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted c-terminal to
gal4 in the psg5 expression vector (stratagene) to generate plasmids
psg5-gal4- xxxg1805xxx , psg5-gal4-nuc-1, and psg5-gal4-ppar,, re-
spectively. the regions of the ppars included in the chimeras should
contain the ligand binding domains based on their homology to ligand
binding domains of characterized nuclear receptors (19, 20). the chi-
meras initially contained the translation start site and n-terminal 262
amino acids of the  xxxg1601xxx , including the 7, transcrip-
tional transactivation domain (21). however, as these chimeras had
high basal activity in cv-1 cells, a 0.6-kilobase bglii fragment contain-
ing the 7, domain was removed, leaving the translation start site and
amino acids 1-76 of the  xxxg1601xxx . wild-type receptor
expression vectors were generated by insertion of cdnas encoding
murine  xxxg1805xxx , nuc-1, pparyl, and ppar y2 into the expression

vector psg5 (stratagene). reporter plasmid (uas),-tk-cat was gener-
ated by insertion of five copies of a gal4 dna binding element into the
bamhi site of pblcat2 (ref. 22). the reporter ap2-tk-cat was gen-
erated by insertion of the 518-bp ecori/xbal fragment containing the
enhancer of the ap2 gene (23) into the bamhi site of pblcat2.
cotransfection assay—cv-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates in
dme medium supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum. in
general, transfection mixes contained 10 ng of receptor expression
vector, 100 ng of the reporter plasmid, 200 ng of b-galactosidase expres-
sion vector (pch110, pharmacia) as internal control, and 200 ng of
carrier plasmid. transfections were done with lipofectamine (life
technologies, inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cell
extracts were prepared and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltrans-
ferase (cat) and b-galactosidase activities as described previously (24).
ligand binding assay—cdna encoding amino acids 174-475 of
ppar yl was amplified via polymerase chain reaction and inserted into
bacterial expression vector pgex-2t (pharmacia). gst-ppary lbd
was expressed in bl21(de3)plyss cells and extracts prepared as de-
scribed previously (25). for saturation binding analysis, bacterial ex-
tracts (100 yg of protein) were incubated at 4°c for 3 h in buffer
containing 10 mm tris (ph 8.0), 50 mm kcl, 10 mm dithiothreitol with
("h]- xxxd3147xxx  (specific activity, 40 ci/mmol) (18) in the presence or
absence of unlabeled  xxxd3147xxx . bound was separated from free radio-
activity by elution through 1-ml sephadex g-25 desalting columns
(boehringer mannheim). bound radioactivity eluted in the column void
volume and was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.
adipocyte differentiation assay—c3h10t1/2 cells were grown in a
24-well plate in dme medium (life technologies, inc.) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum. medium and compound were exchanged every
3 days. cells were stained at day 7 with oil red o and photographed.
northern analysis—c3h10t1/2 cells were grown in 225-mm flasks
in dme medium (life technologies, inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum. medium was exchanged every 3rd day and fresh compound
added. cells were harvested on day 7 and poly(a)* rna prepared using
the polyatract® system 1000 (promega).

results and discussion

thiazolidinediones are selective activators of ppary—a
transient cotransfection assay was used to screen for ppary
activators. as mammalian cell lines contain endogenous nu-
clear receptors that can complicate interpretation of the re-
sults, we used an established chimera system (26). chimeras
were constructed that fused the putative ligand binding do-
mains of the three murine ppar subtypes (a, y, nuc-1) to the
dna binding domain of the yeast transcription factor gal4.
the structural organization of the gal4-ppar chimeras is
shown schematically in fig. 1a.

expression plasmids for the gal4-ppar chimeras were co-
transfected into cv-1 cells with a reporter construct containing
five copies of the gal4 dna binding site upstream of the thy-
midine kinase (tk) promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyl-
transferase (cat) gene expression. as previously reported, all
three ppar subtypes were activated by high concentrations of
the peroxisome proliferator wy14,643 (fig. 18) (5-8, 12).
whereas the  xxxg1805xxx -gal4 chimera was activated in the pres-
ence of 1 x 1075 m wy14,643, activation of the ppary and
nuc-1 chimeras required 1 x 1074 m wy14,643 (fig. 1b). using
this assay, we identified four compounds that were efficacious
activators of the gal4-ppary chimera at a concentration of 1 x
10-5 m, yet had little or no activity on either the gal4- xxxg1805xxx  or
gal4-nuc-1 chimeras (fig. lb), even when concentrations as
high as 1 x 10~* m were used (data not shown). these chemicals
failed to activate a control chimera that lacked a ligand binding
domain (data not shown). interestingly, these four compounds,
termed  xxxd3147xxx , pioglitazone, ciglitazone, and englitazone, fall
into a class of structurally related antidiabetic agents designated
thiazolidinediones (fig. 1c).

the effects of the thiazolidinediones on wild-type ppary
were examined next. two isoforms of ppary, termed ppar y1
and ppar y2, have been identified and shown to differ in their
amino termini (2, 8~10). expression vectors for the two ppary
isoforms were cotransfected into cv-1 cells with a reporter

hancer has previously been shown to contain two ppary re-
sponse elements and to confer responsiveness to pioglitazone
(2, 27). both pparyl and ppary2 were activated by
 xxxd3147xxx  and pioglitazone in a dose-dependent and saturable
manner (fig. 2). interestingly, although the half-maximal con-
centration of activation with pioglitazone was 4 x 107” for
both ppar; isoforms, the ec,, with  xxxd3147xxx  was 3 x 10-8
m and 1 x 10-7 om for the pparyl and ppary2 isoforms,
respectively (fig. 2). thus, the two ppar; isoforms have dis-
tinct activation profiles. ciglitazone and englitazone, although
less potent, also activated both ppary isoforms (fig. 2). no
significant activation of wild-type  xxxg1805xxx  or nuc-1 was seen
in the presence of 1 x 107° m of the thiazolidinediones (data not
shown). likewise, the thiazolidinediones failed to activate
other nuclear receptors including the human  xxxd3417xxx  re-
ceptor a and the human thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  f (data not

fic. 2. thiazolidinediones activate wild-type pparyl and
ppar y2. cv-1 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for
ppary1 (a) or ppary2 (b) and reporter plasmid ap2-tk-cat. cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd3147xxx  (open dia-
monds), pioglitazone (open triangles), ciglitazone (closed squares), and
englitazone (stars), and cell extracts subsequently assayed for cat
activity. similar results were obtained in two independent experiments
performed in triplicate.

activators of ppary.

thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx  is a high affinity ppary li-
gand—although it has been shown that members of the ppar
subfamily of nuclear receptors are activated by micromolar
concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  and hypolipidemic drugs such as
clofibric acid and wy14,643, none of these compounds have
been shown to interact directly with the ppars (5-9, 12). to
test for binding of  xxxd3147xxx  to ppary, the region extending
from the end of the conserved dna binding domain to the c
terminus of ppary, which includes the putative ligand binding
domain (lbd) (19, 20), was expressed in escherichia coli as a
fusion protein with  xxxg1073xxx  (gst-ppary
lbd). radiolabeled  xxxd3147xxx  bound specifically and satura-
bly to gst-ppary lbd with a k, of 43 nm (fig. 3, a and b). no
binding was detected in control extracts from bacteria express-
ing  xxxg1073xxx  (data not shown). consistent
with the dose-response data for ppary in the transient trans-
fection assay,  xxxd3147xxx  was the most effective competitor for
binding of tritiated  xxxd3147xxx  to gst-ppary lbd, followed by
pioglitazone (fig. 3c). ciglitazone and englitazone also com-
peted for binding of tritiated  xxxd3147xxx  to gst-ppary lbd,
albeit less efficiently than pioglitazone (fig. 3c). thus, all four
thiazolidinediones bound directly to ppar y. in control experi-
ments, dexamethasone failed to compete with tritiated
 xxxd3147xxx  for binding to ppary (fig. 3c). these data repre-
sent the first description of ppar ligands and demonstrate
that ppar, is a bona fide member of the steroid/thyroid hor-
mone/retinoid family of ligand-activated transcription factors.

 xxxd3147xxx  promotes differentiation of c3h10t1/2 stem
cells to adipocytes—induction of ppary message is a very
early event during the course of differentiation of several pre-
adipocyte cell lines, preceding the induction of other adipocyte
markers such as ap2 and c/ebpa (2-4). recently, it was
shown that ectopic expression of ppary in fibroblasts induces
the entire adipocyte differentiation program as measured by

specific binding of tritiated  xxxd3147xxx  to gst-pparylbd is indicated
(open triangles). b, scatchard analysis. specific binding of  xxxd3147xxx  in
a was transformed by scatchard analysis and plotted. linear regres-
sion yielded a k, of 43 nm. similar results were obtained in three
independent experiments performed in duplicate. c, competition bind-
ing analysis was performed with gst-pparylbd and 10 no tritiated
 xxxd3147xxx  in the presence of a 100-, 500-, or 2500-fold excess of unla-
beled  xxxd3147xxx  (closed squares), pioglitazone (open squares), englita-
zone (closed circles), ciglitazone (open circles), or dexamethasone (closed
triangles). similar results were obtained in two independent experi-
ments performed in duplicate.

lipid accumulation and induction of adipocyte-specific genes
(4). these data demonstrate a causal role for ppary in adipo-
genesis. to test for an effect of a ppary-selective ligand on
adipogenesis, we treated pluripotent c3h10t1/2 stem cells
with  xxxd3147xxx . untreated c3h10t1/2 cells express ppary as
demonstrated by northern analysis (fig. 4c). treatment of
c3h10t1/2 cells with  xxxd3147xxx  resulted in efficient adipocyte
differentiation as judged by oil red o staining (fig. 4, a and b)
