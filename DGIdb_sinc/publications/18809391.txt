introduction

anabolic androgenic steroids ( xxxg7xxx ) are abused at supratherapeutic doses to improve athletic performance and physical
appearance (yesalis and bahrke, 1995) and aas abusers are
reported to fulfill the dsm-iv criteria for drug dependence

(copeland et al., 2000; pope and katz, 1994). in rodents,  xxxg7xxx 
cause conditioned-place preference, which is reversed by
dopamine antagonists (packard et al., 1998; schroeder and
packard, 2000). additionally, rodents self-administer  xxxg7xxx 
(ballard and wood, 2005; dimeo and wood, 2004; wood et al.,
2004). aas abusers self-report increased aggression and

irritability (bahrke et al., 1992) and are associated with violent
crimes (thiblin and parlklo, 2002). therefore, a number of
animal studies have been performed in order to examine longterm effects of  xxxg7xxx  upon monoamines, their receptors and
metabolites in neurocircuitries involved in these behaviours.
in some studies, sub-chronic aas administration at
supratherapeutic doses reduces dopaminergic function
(birgner et al., 2007; kurling et al., 2008). in one of the
microdialysis studies, the extracellular basal levels of the
dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydrophenylacteic acid (dopac)
and homovanillic acid (hva) are significantly reduced in the
nucleus accumbens after 14 days of  xxxd2696xxx 
administration (15 mg/kg/day i.m.). this difference persists
during the first hour after an amphetamine challenge (birgner
et al., 2007). in a similar study, pre-treatment with nandrolone
 xxxd1821xxx  (5 and 20 mg/kg/48 h for 10 days) attenuates
amphetamine- and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine
(mdma)-induced behavioural response and dopamine release
(kurling et al., 2008). in addition to this,  xxxd2696xxx 
pre-treatment prevents the amphetamine-induced effect on
hippocampal and hypothalamic dopac/dopamine ratios
(birgner et al., 2006). furthermore, 2 weeks of aas administration decreases dopamine d1-like receptor density and
increases dopamine d2-like receptor- and  xxxg2149xxx  densities in the striatum (kindlundh et al., 2001, 2004).
these dopamine receptor changes have been confirmed for
the dopamine d1- and d2-receptor subtypes in the striatum
using in situ-hybridization (kindlundh et al., 2003b). the
dysfunctional dopamine system suggested by these findings
could be related to the late stages in the development of
dependence (koob, 2006).
 xxxg7xxx  increases aggression in several rodent species
(johansson et al., 2000; mcginnis et al., 2002; melloni et al.,
1997; pinna et al., 2005) and the serotonin system may be
implicated in such behavioural changes (ricci et al., 2006). in
hamsters treated with a steroid cocktail consisting of 2 mg/
kg/day of testosterone cypionate, 2 mg/kg/day of nandrolone
 xxxd1821xxx  and 1 mg/kg/day of  xxxd355xxx  for
30 days aggressive behaviour was accompanied by decreased
density of  xxxg1108xxx -receptors in the anterior hypothalamus
(ricci et al., 2006). a  xxxg1108xxx -receptor agonist can reverse the
aggression (ricci et al., 2006), consistent with earlier behavioural studies reporting reduced aggressive and impulsive
behaviours due to either  xxxg1108xxx - or 5ht1b-receptor agonist
administration (simon et al., 1998). in studies on rats,  xxxg7xxx 
decrease the density of 5ht1b-receptors in the ca1 field of
the hippocampus (kindlundh et al., 2003a). however, effects
upon brain levels of serotonin and its metabolites are
inconclusive, possibly due to differences in dosing paradigms (kurling et al., 2005; lindqvist et al., 2002; thiblin
et al., 1999).
previous studies have mainly examined the effect of  xxxg7xxx 
on the monoaminergic systems by measuring transmitter and
metabolite levels or by detecting protein densities of receptors, enzymes and transporters. knowledge of aas-induced
effects on mrna expression of dopaminergic receptors is
limited to the dopamine d1- and d2-receptor subtypes in the
striatum (kindlundh et al., 2003a). the documented literature
of aas-induced effects on mrna expression of dopaminergic
and serotonergic receptors and transporters in other brain

areas regulating cognitive functions, control of behaviour
versus disinhibitory behaviour (impulsivity) and emotions is
restricted. the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are
crucial for cognition and memory and implicated in rewardrelated associative learning (di chiara, 1999; thierry et al.,
2000). the nucleus accumbens is not only characterized by its
acute increase of dopamine release (pontieri et al., 1995) in
response to drugs of abuse, but also, together with the
amygdala, a component of the “extended amygdala” (di
chiara et al., 1999). this area is important for e.g. emotional
conditioning. the prefrontal cortex is also important for the
regulation of inhibitory control of behaviour and therefore
plays a role in disinhibition and impulsivity (jentsch and
taylor, 1999; tekin and cummings, 2002). the primary aim of
the present study was therefore to investigate whether genetranscript expressions of dopaminergic and serotonergic
receptor subtypes, transporters and enzymes, are implicated
in aas-induced effects in brain regions predominantly
regulating cognitive functions, memory, inhibitory behaviour
and emotions (the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus
accumbens and the amygdala).  xxxd2696xxx  was
administered to male rats for 14 days at doses of 3 or 15 mg/kg/
day. based on a one-year follow-up study of aas abusers
(fudala et al., 2003), the dosing paradigm aimed to mimic one
cycle of human abuse during light and experienced aas abuse,
respectively.

results

two weeks of daily  xxxd2696xxx  administration
significantly elevated the dopamine d1-receptor mrna
expression in the amygdala at a dose of 15 mg/kg (f2, 20 = 8.16,
p = 0.003), but decreased it in the hippocampus at doses of 3 and
15 mg/kg, respectively (f2, 25 = 6.72, p = 0.005) (table 1). the
dopamine d4-receptor mrna expression was significantly
increased in the nucleus accumbens by  xxxd2696xxx 
at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days, both compared to controls
and the group of rats administered the highest dose of 15 mg/
kg/day (f2, 22 = 4.93, p = 0.017) (table 1). no statistically significant changes regarding dopamine-related transcripts were
detected in the prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area and
substantia nigra. none of the serotonin-related transcript
levels examined were statistically changed (table 2).

discussion

the major findings in the present study are that 2 weeks of
daily  xxxd2696xxx  administration (3 or 15 mg/kg)
causes alterations in mrna expression of dopamine receptors, but not in any of the investigated serotonin receptors.
in the nucleus accumbens, the lower  xxxd2696xxx 
dose of 3 mg/kg increased the transcription level of the
dopamine d4-receptor, whereas no alterations were observed
at the highest dose (15 mg/kg) (table 1). biphasic dose–response
relationships have, indeed, been described in the literature for
several transmitters and hormones, including androgens
(calabrese, 2001b) and estrogens (calabrese, 2001a). increased
mrna expression of the dopamine d4-receptor in the nucleus

accumbens may explain some of the behavioural changes
reported in aas abusers. for example, the dopamine d4receptor has been implicated in novelty seeking (dulawa et al.,
1999) and impaired behavioural inhibition (avale et al., 2004),
behavioural features that both are related to schizophrenia and
substance abuse. dopamine d4-receptor antagonists display
antipsychotic effects (boeckler et al., 2004) and several atypical
neuroleptics have high affinity for the dopamine d4-receptor
(seeman et al., 1997). d4-receptor knock-out mice display

decreased basal levels of dopamine, dopac and hva in the
striatum, as measured by microdialysis (thomas et al., 2007),
and unaltered or even increased sensitivity to ethanol, cocaine
and methamphetamine, compared to wild type mice (rubinstein et al., 1997). this is consistent with the results of increased
dopamine d4 transcription in the present study and decreased
sensitivity to other drugs, shown repeatedly after aas treatment (birgner et al., 2006, 2007; celerier et al., 2003, 2006; kurling
et al., 2008; lindqvist et al., 2002). however, chronic aas

224

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 2 4 0 ( 2 00 8 ) 2 2 1 –22 8

administration also decreases extracellular levels of dopamine,
dopac and hva (birgner et al., 2007; kurling et al., 2008), which
is inconsistent with the dopamine d4 knock-out phenotype.
therefore, the role of dopamine d4-receptor mrna expression
in the mechanism behind aas-induced alterations remains to
be evaluated.
the transcription level of the dopamine d1-receptor was
increased in the amygdala after administration of 15 mg/kg of
 xxxd2696xxx  (table 1). the amygdala is innervated
by the ventral tegmental area, and is together with the nucleus
accumbens involved in stimulus-reward learning, as part of
the extended amygdala (di chiara, 1999; koob, 2003). in the
basolateral amygdala, dopamine d1-receptor activation contributes to acquisition of cocaine-cue association (berglind
et al., 2006) and drug-seeking behaviour (see et al., 2001). thus,
the increased transcription of the dopamine d1-receptor in
the amygdala might contribute to drug-seeking behaviour
often seen among aas abusers. in the hippocampus, on the
other hand, the transcription level of the dopamine d1receptor was decreased by both doses of  xxxd2696xxx  (table 1). in addition to glutamate, dopamine has the
ability to modulate hippocampal plasticity, in the form of
long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd),
particularly during novelty detection (lisman and grace,
2005). d1/d5 antagonists impair late-phase ltp (lemon and
manahan-vaughan, 2006) and long-term memory (o'carroll
et al., 2006) whereas d1/d5 agonists facilitate late-phase ltp

(li et al., 2003). spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity
were unaffected in studies using a steroid cocktail consisting
of 2 mg/kg/day of testosterone cypionate, 2 mg/kg/day of
 xxxd2696xxx  and 1 mg/kg/day of  xxxd355xxx  for either 4 or 12 weeks (clark et al., 1995; smith et al.,
1996), and impaired memory function after 15 mg/kg/day of
nandrolone decanaote for 6 weeks (kouvelas et al., 2008). the
possible effects of aas on learning and memory need to be
further evaluated.
regarding serotonin receptors, the gene-transcript level of
the 5ht2a-receptor in the nucleus accumbens showed a trend
towards an increase, but this did not reach statistical
significance (table 2). earlier, 2 weeks of  xxxd2696xxx  administration to male sprague–dawley rats upregulated
5ht2-receptor densities in the nucleus accumbens shell (at 1,
5 and 15 mg/kg) and the ventromedial hypothalamus (at 1 and
5 mg/kg) using in vitro-autoradiography (kindlundh et al.,
2003a). interestingly, testosterone replacement in castrated
male rats has been shown to increase the 5ht2a-receptor
mrna content in the dorsal raphe nucleus (fink et al., 1999)
and ventromedial hypothalamus (zhang et al., 1999). previously, the 5ht2-receptor density was also shown to be
decreased in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala
(kindlundh et al., 2003a). no corresponding alterations in
mrna levels of 5ht2-receptors could be detected with qpcr in
this study. however, since the radioligand used in the in vitroautoradiography study labelled the 5ht2 receptors

unselectively, whereas the primers used in the current qpcr
are specific towards different 5ht2-receptor subtypes, findings from the different studies are not comparable. the data
indicate that changes in protein levels can be due to
posttranslational processing. the lack of linearity between
mrna level and protein level in the serotonin system has been
reported earlier, e.g. for the serotonin transporter in the
macaque brain following ovarian steroid treatment (lu et al.,
2003; smith et al., 2004).
in conclusion, sub-chronic administration of the aas
 xxxd2696xxx  significantly altered the gene-transcript levels of dopamine d1- and d4-receptors in the nucleus
accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus. these findings may
explain behavioural changes often observed in aas abusers
such as impulsivity and drug-seeking.

(activational systems, warren, mi, usa). the prefrontal
cortex (bregma n + 4.2), nucleus accumbens (bregma + 2.2 to
+ 1.0), hippocampus (bregma −1.8 to −5.3), amygdala (bregma −
1.8 to −3.3), ventral tegmental area (−5.2 to − 5.6) and the
substantia nigra (−4.8 to −6.04) were collected. tissues were
immersed in rnalater (ambion) allowing the solution to
infiltrate the tissue for 1 h in room temperature. all samples
were stored in − 80 °c until prepared for analysis. the
experimental procedure was approved by the animal care
and ethical committee in uppsala, sweden.

experimental procedures

4.1.

animals

ten-week-old male sprague–dawley rats (b&k, sollentuna,
sweden) were housed three in each cage at constant
conditions (22 °c, 60% humidity, a twelve-hour light/dark
circle, and food and water provided ad libitum). after being
allowed to adapt to the new environment for 7 days, the rats
were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10). two groups
were administered intramuscular injections of nandrolone
 xxxd1821xxx  (deca- xxxd2697xxx ®, organon, oss, netherlands) at a

qpcr

the used method, qpcr, offers a variety of advantages, such as
the normalization to a stable set of house-keeping genes
(hkgs) and the possibility to quantify a large number of
transcripts in the same individual. the primers were designed
with beacon designer (v4.0). forward and reverse primers,
together with accession numbers, for both house-keeping
genes (hkgs) and genes of interest (gois) are presented in
table 3. the basic local alignment search tool (blast) from
the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) was
used to verify that no homologies were shared between
amplified sequences and other cdna in the database.

total rna was isolated from individual brain tissue
samples by phenol–chloroform extraction. tissue samples
were homogenized in 500 mul trizol® (invitrogen ab, stockholm, sweden) by ultrasonication with a branson sonifier.
100 mul chloroform was added and the homogenate was
centrifuged at 12 000 ×g for 15 min (4 °c). the supernatant
was transferred to a new tube and rna was precipitated in
isopropanol. the pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol,
thereafter air-dried and dissolved in dnaase buffer. dnaase
treatment was performed at 37 °c for 2 h in order to remove
dna contamination, followed by inactivation of the dnaase
at 75 °c for 15 min. rna purity was validated by pcr and
gel-electrophoreses using primers for  xxxd3426xxx  bp cdna of
 xxxg861xxx . rna concentration was determined using a nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer (saveen & werner ab,
limhamn, sweden). cdna synthesis was performed with mmlv reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's
protocol, using random hexamer primers (ge healthcare,
sweden). the cdna synthesis was validated by pcr and
gel-electrophoreses.
qpcr was performed in a final reaction volume of 25 mul
(20 mm tris–hcl (ph 8.4), 50 mm kcl, 4 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm
dntp, sybr green 1:50 000, 10 nm fluoroscein, 0.8 pmol/mul each
of reverse and forward primer, 0.02 u/mul taq dna polymerase)
using an icycler real-time detection instrument (bio-rad
laboratories, sundbyberg, sweden). 50 cycles were performed.
annealing temperatures were 62 °c for all gois and 60 °c for
the hkgs. melting point curves were included to confirm that
only one product was formed. each assay included individual
samples in duplicate and a negative control in triplicate.
icycler iq v3.0 software was used to analyse qpcr data where
the starting quantity means were normalized to the maximum sample value of each plate, resulting in values falling
between 0 and 1. for the nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex a standard curve of four dilution points in triplicates
was included, and for the hypothalamus, amygdala and
substantia nigra the sample values were corrected for primer
efficiency using the linregpcr protocol (ramakers et al.,
2003). sample values were then divided by the normalization
factors created according to the 2 − deltadeltact method (livak and
schmittgen, 2001). the most stable set of hkgs out of seven
tested in each tissue was selected using the genorm protocol
(vandesompele et al., 2002), an approach which we have
previously validated (lindblom et al., 2006). the hkgs
included in the normalization factors were, for the prefrontal
cortex: act, h3b, tub; nucleus accumbens: cyclo,  xxxg861xxx ,
sdca; hippocampus: act, h3b,  xxxg1979xxx ; amygdala: act,
 xxxg861xxx ,  xxxg1979xxx ; ventral tegmental area: cyclo, h3b,  xxxg1979xxx ;
and substantia nigra:  xxxg861xxx , h3b,  xxxg1979xxx  (for abbreviations,
see table 3).

4.3.

statistics

statistical analysis was performed using prism v4.0 (graphpad
software inc.). the differences in normalized gene-transcript
levels were statistically evaluated with one-way anova and
newman–keuls multiple comparison test when appropriate.
results were considered significant when p b 0.05. grubb's test
was used to identify outliers.
