glomerulosclerosis

abstract
the high recurrence rate of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) in kidney
transplant recipients suggests that such patients have a circulating factor that alters
glomerular capillary permeability. serum from patients with fsgs increases glomerular
permeability to albumin. this permeability factor has been partially identified as a protein.
the removal of this protein by plasmapheresis (pp) decreases proteinuria. in this study we
report data on the therapeutic effects of pp in fsgs children with recurrence in the
transplanted kidney. three hundred pediatric (age ⬍19 years) renal transplants were performed, including 21 patients (24 transplants) with fsgs as a cause of renal failure.
fourteen (58.3%) subjects experienced disease recurrence (proteinuria ⬎1 g/m2 per day)
within 1 month after transplantation. mean age patient was 12 ⫾ 4.3 years, including
83.3% caucasians and 70.2% recipients of living donor grafts. nine were treated with 10
cycles of pp (3 cycles/weekly), initiated immediately after recurrence (⬍48 hours).
immunosuppression included high doses of cyclosporine (c2 levels of 1700 –1800 ng/ml),
mycophenolate sodium or mofetil, and prednisone. thirteen patients were induced with
anti- xxxg1173xxx  receptor monoclonal antibody ( xxxd1798xxx / xxxd286xxx ). among the patients who
underwent pp, five (55.5%) achieved a complete remission and one (12%), a partial
remission (1 g/24 hours). there were no cases of remission among the five patients who
were not treated with pp. those who achieved remission after pp experienced no
recurrences during the 2.6 ⫾ 1.4 years follow-up. pp appears to be effective to treat
recurrent fsgs following kidney transplantation. it should be started as soon as possible.

t

he clinical course of primary focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) is frequently complicated
by nephrotic range proteinuria and progression to renal
failure.1 recurrence of fsgs in the transplanted kidney is
a severe condition associated with graft loss. the high
recurrence rate of the disease in transplanted kidneys
suggests that such patients have a circulating factor that
alters glomerular capillary permeability.2 in recent years
some authors have observed that sera from patients with
fsgs increase glomerular permeability to albumin. the
permeability factor has been partially identified as a 30 to
50 kd protein.3,4 the removal of this protein by plasmapheresis (pp) decreases the proteinuria. in this report we
provide preliminary data on the therapeutic effect of pp in
children with recurrent posttransplant fsgs.
patients and methods
from 1977 to 2005, 300 pediatric (age ⬍19 years) renal transplants
were performed, including 21 patients (24 transplants) who had

fsgs as the cause of renal failure as confirmed by pretransplant
biopsy. fourteen (58.3%) of these subjects experienced recurrences (proteinuria ⬎1 g/m2 per day) within 1 month of transplantation. the patients displayed a mean age of 12 ⫾ 4.3 years, 83.3%
were caucasians, 70.2% had received a graft from a living donor.
since 2001, patients who presented with recurrent fsgs were
treated with 10 cycles of pp (3 cycles/weekly), initiated immediately
postrecurrence (⬍48 hours). for financial reasons, the number of
sessions had to be limited to 10. in each session, 50 to 75 ml/kg of
patient plasma was exchanged with 5% to 8% albumin. immunosuppressive therapy consisted of high doses of cyclosporine (c2
levels of 1700 –1800 ng/ml), mycophenolate sodium or mofetil
(until 1997 azathioprin was used), and prednisone. thirteen pafrom santo antônio children’s hospital, santa casa hospital

plasmapheresis for post-transplant fsgs
tients received induction with an anti- xxxg1173xxx  receptor monoclonal
antibody ( xxxd1798xxx / xxxd286xxx ).

results

twenty-four transplants were performed in 21 children with
fsgs, 14 (58.3%) of whom showed recurrences. of these,
nine (64.3%) were treated with pp. five of the nine (55.5%)
patients treated with pp went into complete remission
(⬍0.2 g/m2 per day) and one (12%) into partial remission (1 g/
24 hours) after receiving a total of 10 sessions. there was no
recurrence during the 2.6 ⫾ 1.4 years follow-up. infectious
complications were observed in three patients after pp: one
cytomegalovirus disease and two varicella.
there were no cases of remission among the five patients
who were not treated with pp. all untreated patients had
persistent nephrotic proteinuria range losing their grafts at
3.2 ⫾ 2.3 years after the transplant.
discussion

steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with fsgs is one of
the most common lesions leading to renal transplantation in
children.5,6 the recurrence rate is approximately 30% with
half of the grafts lost. several therapeutic regimens have
been proposed, although with conflicting results.7,8
the rapid onset of proteinuria, in general, immediately
after renal transplantation, led to the hypothesis that recurrence of fsgs was caused by a circulating plasma factor.5,9
clinical experiments demonstrated that injection of patient
serum induced proteinuria in rats.3 this circulating factor is
associated with increased glomerular permeability to albumin in recurrent fsgs.10,11 the presence of a plasma
factor may explain the benefits of plasma exchange
treatment.4,12,13
it is evident from our data and from the literature that
the effectiveness of pp treatment is quite variable; some
patients do not respond at all, whereas others experience a
relapse. these differences may be explained by variations in
the study population or in the time of onset and magnitude
of proteinuria. also, there may be differences in the level or
pathogenicity of the permeability factor, or even in the
sensitivity of the kidney to this molecule. there is some
evidence that the starting time of treatment is important.
better results are obtained when plasma exchange is started
early after the onset of proteinuria when the the renal
biopsy shows no abnormalities, except for foot process
fusion on electronic microscopy. in contrast, if pp is
delayed or after the fsgs lesions are well established, it is
less effective.6,14 –17 our study demonstrated favorable effects of plasma exchange on proteinuria in six of nine
patients with fsgs recurrence, who remained in remission
after the treatment.

in conclusion, early pp treatment for recurrent posttransplant fsgs was successful in the majority of this series of
cases without a definite adverse event. pp appeared to be
effective when started as soon as possible.
