the antitumoral activity of 13-demethyl or 13-substituted all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and 9-cis retinoic
acid (9cra) was tested using the myeloid leukemia cell line hl-60. cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry and dna fragmentation assay. the ability to bind to human  xxxg1998xxx  and
to activate either human  xxxd3417xxx  response element (rare)-mediated gene expression or rat crabpii
retinoid x response element ( xxxg1998xxx  )-mediated gene expression were determined using luciferase reporter plasmids. in terms of the magnitude of the regulatory activity for the proliferation and differentiation of hl-60 cells,
the compounds ranked as follows: atra13-ethyl atra13-demethyl atra13-phenylethyl atra13propyl atra13-butyl atra (atra analogues) and 9cra13-ethyl 9cra13-demethyl 9cra13-propyl
9cra13-phenetyl 9cra13-butyl 9cra (9cra analogues). regarding the magnitude of the apoptosis-inducing activity, the order was: 9cra13-ethyl 9cra13-demethyl 9cra, with atra and its analogues and
the other 9cra analogues virtually inactive. similar trends were observed in binding affinity for  xxxg1998xxx  and
transactivation activity toward rare- or rxre-mediated gene expression. the results clearly indicate that the
presence of a methyl group at c-13 is essential for the antitumoral activity of atra and 9cra, and that bulky
substituents exceeding two carbon atoms or the absence of substitution at position 13 significantly reduce the
binding affinity for rar and rxr, leading to a decreased rar/rare and/or rxr/rxre-mediated gene expression.

retinoids, namely all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and its
natural or synthetic analogues, have potential chemopreventive and therapeutic applications in the field of dermatology
and oncology due to their potent antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing activities towards many benign and malignant tumors. in particular, atra has been shown to be a potent inducer of the differentiation of acute promyelocytic
leukemia (apl) blasts and is widely used with chemotherapeutic drugs to treat apl.1,2) however, the clinical use of
retinoids is largely restricted for the several reasons. the
doses needed for successful treatment often cause hypervitaminosis a syndrome and some patients with apl eventually
relapse with the development of resistance to atra. in attempts to overcome these problems, numerous retinoids have
been synthesized and their antitumoral activity has been evaluated in the search for compounds with greater efficacy and
fewer side-effects. however, these efforts have been only partially successful to date, and the search for retinoids exhibiting a better therapeutic index continues. although the precise
molecular mechanisms underlying atra-induced growth inhibition and differentiation remain unclear, it is well established that in many cells, these activities involve modulations
of gene expression and are mediated by binding to the
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) and/or the nuclear retinoid x
receptors (rxrs). it has been shown that rars are activated
by many bioactive compounds including atra and 9cra,
while rxrs are activated only by 9cra.3,4)
the leukemic cell lineage hl-60 is considered a good
model for the study of antiproliferative and prodifferentiating
effects of retinoids.5) in the presence of different agents, particularly retinoids, hl-60 cells can be induced to differenti∗ to whom correspondence should be addressed.

effects of 13-demethyl or 13-substituted analogues of
atra and 9cra on cell cycle phase of hl-60 cells

september 2006

atra and 9cra have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at g0/g1 in benign and malignant tumor cells including
hl-60 cells.10,11) to examine the antiproliferative effect on
hl-60 cell growth, we measured the cell cycle phase distribution of hl-60 cells treated with increasingly higher concentrations of either atra, 9cra or their analogues. after
incubation with atra or its analogues for 3 d, all the cells
were stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide. the results are depicted
in fig. 2. the percentages of hl-60 cells arrested at the
g0/g1 phase increased significantly from 46.3% (vehicletreated cells) to 74.9% (106 m atra-treated cells), while
those arrested at the s phase decreased significantly from
45.3% (vehicle-treated cells) to 15.7% (106 m atra-treated
cells). atra analogues also caused hl-60 cells to arrest at
g0/g1 and a decrease in cells in the s phase in a dose-dependent fashion. in order of the magnitude of the cell cycle
regulatory activity, the atra analogues ranked as follows:

discussion
in this study, we examined the regulatory activities of 13demethyl or 13-substituted analogues of atra and 9cra
toward the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of hl60 cells. our results clearly indicate that in both series of
analogues, the replacement of the methyl group at c-13 with
a hydrogen, ethyl, propyl, butyl or phenylethyl group induces
a decrease or loss of these biological activities. the influence
of such modifications on the side-chain was much more
prominent in the 9cra analogues than atra analogues,
probably making it more difficult to bind to nuclear receptors, rxr and rar. demethylation and substitutions at position 13 of atra significantly reduced the potency to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation presumably due to a
decrease in the transactivation activity through a rar/rare
signaling pathway. however, these analogues were still biologically active at the concentrations tested. in contrast, the
same modifications at position 13 of 9cra remarkably reduced or diminished the ability to regulate the proliferation
and differentiation of hl-60 cells, apparently due to a severe
decrease in the binding affinity for rxr and incomplete
rxr/rxre-mediated signaling. based on these findings, it
is conceivable that the presence of the methyl group at c-13
of atra and 9cra is important for the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of hl-60 cells and around the c13 methyl group there lies a large enough cavity to adopt

alkyl groups exceeding two carbon atoms or a bulky substitute, a phenylethyl group, in the rar molecule, while the
corresponding cavity in the rxr molecule may be much
smaller and can adopt only a methyl or ethyl group. danshina et al.13,14) reported that the introduction at position 13
of the chromophore of hydrocarbon substituents bulkier than
that of the natural bacteriorhodopsin diminished the amplitudes of the electric photoresponses. furthermore, bulky substituents or an absence of substitution at position 13 of retinals decelerated the relaxation of m-inermediates and disturbed 13-cis- to all-trans-isomerization. thus, in bacteriorhodopsin, the presence of the methyl group at position 13
is essential for the light-driven proton transport and these
previous findings are consistent with our results of the 9cra
analogues binding to the  xxxg1998xxx  molecule.
it has been well documented that atra is a potent inhibitor and inducer of proliferation and differentiation of hl60 cells due to its high binding affinity for rar, while its
ability to induce apoptosis is very weak because of its low
affinity for rxr. in contrast, 9cra is a potent inhibitor and
inducer of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of hl60 cells due to its high binding affinity for both rar and
rxr. the present results were well consistent with previous
findings. among atra, 9cra and their analogues, 9cra
was the most potent retinoid in terms of inducing in differentiation and apoptosis of hl-60 cells probably due to its high
binding affinity for rxr along with relatively high affinity
for rar. the 13-ethyl analogue, 9c102, and 13-demethyl
analogue, 9c100, both possess relatively high binding affin-

ity for  xxxg1998xxx  and for rar, although a rar binding assay
was not performed, and therefore, it seems that they can exhibit significant differentiation-inducing activity in hl-60
cells (fig. 4b). based on these findings, it is suggested that
rar can recognize precisely the structural difference between an ethyl group and a hydrogen at position 13 of atra
and 9cra.
nagy et al.15) previously reported that ligand-induced activation of the rar moiety in the rar/rxr heterodimer is
sufficient to induce the differentiation of hl-60 cells, but ligand-induced activation of the rxr moiety is not sufficient to
induce differentiation, although it may potentiate cell differentiation mediated by rar binding. based on these findings,
it has been postulated that the differentiation of hl-60 cells
can be controlled by synthetic retinoids possessing the ability
to regulate a rar signaling or a rxr signaling, selectively.
 xxxd3284xxx ,16) an aromatic amide of  xxxd3417xxx , has been shown
to bind to and activate rar selectively. hx600,17) a dibenzodiazepine derivative, has been shown to be a rxr selective
agonist and also exhibits synergistic activity with rar ligands, although hx600 itself can not activate rar/rxr heterodimers. in this study, we did not succeed in finding a
rxr-selective agonist among the 13-demethyl or 13-substituted analogues of atra and 9cra.
hl-60 cells not only differentiate but also are capable of
undergoing apoptosis in response to  xxxd3417xxx . ligandevoked activation of endogenous rar is sufficient to induce
differentiation of the hl-60 cells but the induction of apoptosis requires the activation of endogenous rxr.15) in our
study, 9cra induced apoptosis in hl-60 cells. previous
studies indicated that compounds that activate both rar and
rxr could induce apoptosis. in this study, 9c102 and
9c100 were able to induce apoptosis in hl-60 cells. their
apoptosis-inducing activity was very weak and only seen at
low concentrations that were not high enough to induce hl60 cell differentiation and to activate rar or rxr-mediated
gene expression. the molecular mechanisms underlying the
induction of apoptosis by 9c102 and 9c100 remain unclear,
however, and it is conceivable that their apoptosis-inducing
activity is independent from a rar- or rxr-mediated signaling pathway.
in summary, we have evaluated for the first time the biological effects of 13-demethyl or 13-substituted analogues of
atra and 9cra on the proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis of hl-60 cells along with transactivation activity
in transfected mg-63 cells. these analogues exhibited
unique activity profiles depending upon the substituent at c13. our results suggest that the presence of a methyl group at
c-13 is essential for the antitumoral activities of atra and

1809

9cra, and that a bulky substituent exceeding two carbon
atoms or the absence of a substitution at position 13 significantly reduced their binding affinity for rar or rxr, leading to a decreased rar/rare and /or rxr/rxre-mediated gene expression.
these findings should provide useful information for the
development of analogues of atra and 9cra for biomedical applications.
