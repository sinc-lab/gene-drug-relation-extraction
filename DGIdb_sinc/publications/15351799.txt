abstract. many athletes use drugs, especially anabolic androgenic steroids (aas), but there are few reports on the
endocrinological and pathological changes in aas abusers. in this study we reported the results of endocrinological
examinations in rats administered aas and also physical changes. we separated 37 male wistar rats (7 weeks old) into 3
groups: group a was medicated with  xxxd2696xxx , metenolone acetate, and  xxxd1942xxx ; group b with
 xxxd2696xxx  and saline; and group c was given only saline. they were given subcutaneous injections of the
medications or the control vehicle once a week for 6 weeks. medications were stopped for 4 weeks, and then resumed for
another 6 weeks. after that, rats were sacrificed. serum testosterone level in group a was significantly higher than that in
group c. serum dihydrotestosterone in group a was significantly higher than that in both groups b and c. serum
estradiol-17b levels in groups a and b were significantly higher than that in group c. in pathological evaluation, heart,
testis, and adrenal gland were severely damaged. these findings indicate that there is a high degree of risk related to the
use of aas.

ben johnson, a canadian athlete who used the
anabolic-androgenic steroid (aas) stanozolol, was
disqualified from the seoul olympics in an effort to
control doping. after this notorious incident, reports
of such cases have been numerous. in japan, bodybuilders and the other athletes sometimes test positive
for aas use. takahashi, who has investigated aas
abuse among japanese athletes, reported two cases of
doping by japanese athlete [1, 2]. traditionally, it has
been thought that japanese athletes refrain from aas
use and so the public was shocked to hear of these incidents. greater anti-doping efforts and treatment for
the deleterious side effects of these drugs in japanese
athletes are needed. however, since doping control in
japan has been minimal in the past, the number of
japanese doctors and scientists participating in doping

control efforts has naturally been fewer than those in
other countries [3, 4]. because aas abuse in athletics
is widespread the side effects elicited by aas abuse
have been extensively reported [5–10].
psychotic states and infertility have social implications [11–15] and are among the serious side effects
elicited by aas abuse. however, the pathophysiology
and prognosis of aas use remains unclear. bashin et
al., berman et al., bross et al., and tricker et al.
attempted to quantify the side effects of testosterone
administration in humans [16–19]. as is unethical to
administer high doses of aas in humans, in the
current study we have used animals to determine the
pathology and prognosis resulting from aas use. we
previously reported the results of hematological and
biochemical examinations following aas administration in rats, and included data reporting the changes in
body and organ weights in these animals [20]. based
on our previous findings, we hypothesized that aas
administration would result in significant deleterious
effects on organ tissue pathology and endocrine function. pathological evaluation especially revealed

takahashi et al.

severe damage to heart, testis, and adrenal gland. aas
administration further resulted in a severe imbalance in
the endocrine system.

methods
animals and experimental conditions
we separated 37 male wistar rats (7 weeks old)
into 3 groups: group a (n = 12) was administered
 xxxd2696xxx  (8.33 × 10–2 mg/g; sankyo co.
ltd., tokyo), metenolone acetate (1.67 × 10–1 mg/g;
japan schering co., ltd., osaka), and  xxxd1942xxx 
(8.33 × 10–2 mg/g; shionogi co., ltd., osaka); group
b (n = 12) received  xxxd2696xxx  and saline;
and group c (n = 13) was given only saline. these
drug dosages were converted from 100 times the general dose for 60 kg body weight in humans, since this
dose has been previously found to be used by drug
abusers [21]. such doses were chosen based on the
fact that 100 times the normal dosing is necessary to
pharmacologically investigate the pathological effects
of drug abuse. each rat was housed in individual
cage (25 × 13 × 16 cm), and given access to rat chow
pellets (oriental yeast co. ltd., tokyo) and water ad
libitum. temperature and moisture averaged 25 ± 2°c
and 75 ± 10%, respectively. after a week of acclimation, animals were given subcutaneous injections of
aas or the control vehicle once a week for 6 weeks.
drug administration was stopped for 4 weeks, and then
resumed for another 6 weeks. this dosing regimen
was used to duplicate the “stacking” of aas and the
“steroid cycle” that is used by aas abusers in athletics. these studies followed the ethical guidelines set
by international budo university.
sacrifice
after two cycles of steroid administration, rats were
sacrificed by removing 12 ml of blood from the heart
under ether anesthesia. serum and plasma were preserved. we then extracted and recorded the wet
weight of skeletal muscles (m. extensor digitorum
longus, m. gastrocnemius, m. plantaris, m. soleus, m.
levator ani), liver, spleen, heart, kidney, adrenal gland,
and prostate gland. collected blood and tissue samples were used to make a hormonal profile. in addition, these experiments were performed during the

nighttime hours.
endocrinological examinations
endocrinological examinations included measurement of  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and
atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) in plasma, and corticosterone, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (dht),
estradiol-17b (e2), and erythropoietin (epo) in serum.
furthermore, we measured prostate specific antigen
(psa). organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin. next the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, adrenal
gland, testis, prostate gland, and spleen were routinely
processed for paraffin embedding. organs were cut
into 10 mm thin sections and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (h.e.). these tissue samples were then
examined under light microscope for quantification of
histopathological changes following aas administration.
statistical analysis
significant differences were identified using oneway anova. if the anova revealed significant
main effects (p<0.05), sheffe’s post-hoc method of one
way factorial anova and multiple comparison tests
were then used.

results
behavioral observations during experimental period
after 3 weeks, some group a and group b rats exhibited hair loss (fig. 1). after 4 weeks, some group
a (n = 5) and group b rats (n = 9) exhibited such
aggressive behavior that they could not be handled
without gloves. after 5 weeks, some rats of group b
(n = 3) demonstrated extremely aggressive and hostile
behavior. after 1 cycle of aas administration, all
group a and group b animals exhibited inactive
behavior, as evidenced by lack of locomotion upon
stimulation. a very slow locomotor movement upon
physical contact was further evident following this
experiment. after 9 weeks, two rats of group a and
group b caused self-inflicted injuries to their tails.
after 10 weeks, 6 of 12 rats in both groups a and b
were also observed to have self-inflicted bite wounds.
after 2 cycles, all group b and 4 rats of group a

exhibited aggressive and hostile, behavior again. after
13 week, these rats became physically inactive (fig. 2).

significantly higher than in group c (p<0.001). measured erythropoietin (epo) in group a was significantly lower than in group b (p<0.01) and in group c

pathological findings
we examined the pathological changes in rats following aas administration by light microscopy. the
myocardium and pericardium in the hearts of group a
rats exhibited partial fibrosis, and small round cells invaded the myocardium. scarring of the pericardium
was observed as well. cardiac myofibrils were irregularly lined, and vacuolar degeneration was observed
(fig. 5). in the kidney of group a, tubular epithelial
cells were swollen and reduced in numbers. distal tubules were partially hemorrhaged, and pas positive

sediments were also observed (fig. 6). the prostate
gland of group a was macroscopically hypertrophied.
adenomatous hypertrophy especially in the dorsolateral lobe, irregular epithelial proliferation and
starch-like sediments in the vacuoles of these cells
were also observed (fig. 7). in the testes of group a,
spermatozoa were scarred within the lumen of the
seminiferous tubules, and supporting sertoli cells were
reduced in numbers. furthermore, few interstitial cells
(leydig cells) were visible (fig. 8). although the liver
of group a was not macroscopically altered, the central veins of individual lobules were dilated, and partial
congestion in interlobular tissue was observed. because liver cells were turbid and slightly swollen, sinusoidal capillaries were not clearly observable (fig. 9).
although the wet weight of the adrenal glands of
group a was unchanged, vacuole degeneration could
be observed within the zona reticularis. the compact
cells in the upper margin of the zona fasciculata tended
to be dominant (fig. 10).

discussion
in the current study we used supraphysiologic doses
of aas in rats to investigate the pathological and
prognostic effects of aas abuse. in general, 100
times the normal dosing is necessary to pharmacologically investigate pathological effects of drug abuse
[21]. it is well established that the psychological state
of human subjects becomes unstable with aas abuse
[5, 22, 23]. furthermore pope et al. reported that
supraphysiologic doses of testosterone administration
increased ratings of manic symptoms in a few normal
men, but most showed few psychological changes
[24]. in our study, we observed hostile, aggressive
behaviors in rats following aas administration, sug-

gesting that aas and androgens might have some
effect on the central nervous system which could induce abnormal behavior. after a period of hostility,
the animals became inactive evidenced by a lack of
locomotor activity upon physical contact. martinez et
al. reported that some testosterone treated male mice
exhibited aggressive behaviors as well [25]. taken
together these data indicate that the neurological system becomes abnormal.
corticosterone level was not altered by aas administration, indicating that the rats had not experienced
any degree of significant stress in response to the doping protocol. levels of acth in groups a and b
were lower than those in group c. this finding indicates that a negative feedback response to the increase

in circulating androgens may have been initiated. in
this study, we hypothesized that plasma testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol-17b levels of aasadministered rats would be lower as previously reported in humans [13]. however, the results from the current study were in complete opposition to our original

hypothesis. aas administration in rats elicited a significant elevation in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,
and estradiol-17b. we speculate that both endogenous
testosterone and exogenous testosterone or testosteronelike substances were measured. the differences in the
aas metabolic system between rats and humans could
be responsible for these discrepant results. we were
unable to replicate the same results in preliminary
studies. bitran et al. reported that blood testosterone

levels were increased 7-fold by 1 week administration
of testosterone propinate, and 10-fold by 2 weeks administration [26]. the elevations in dihydrotestosterone
and estradiol-17b were also accompanied by an elevation in testosterone.
erythropoietin levels of group a were significantly
lower than those in groups b and c. saitoh et al. reported that injection of nandrolone into mice enhanced

431

erythropoietin levels [27]. we speculate that the discrepancy between these results and those in the present
study is due to the difference in the dose of nandrolone
utilized. because we administered aas at very high
doses, most likely a negative feedback inhibition of
epo was elicited due to an elevation in hemoglobin
levels in response to aas administration [20].
as we originally hypothesized, pathological findings indicate that organs dependent on androgens were
significantly damaged following aas administration.
the prostate gland was macroscopically and microscopically hypertrophied, although there was no evidence of carcinoma. hypertrophy of the prostate to
this degree most likely would have caused the drainage
of urine to be less likely. prostate specific antigen was
within the normal range. bitran et al. reported that
the prostate gland weight of rats with 2 week of
methandrostenolone injected decreased after aas
discontinuation [26]. the true mechanism causing
such discrepancy cannot be adequately explained.
in the testes, almost all sertoli cells and leydig cells
were reduced in numbers, and the overall damage to
the testes was tremendous. due to negative feedback
mechanisms, the secretion of endogenous testosterone
was completely inhibited. there are a few reports that
the testicular weights of male rats decreased throughout the aas treatment period [28, 29]. the findings
from the current study supports this fact. although
athletes and students readily use aas, this finding is
very shocking, and aas abusers would most likely be
quite alarmed if they knew of these pathological effects on the testes [29]. when leydig cells are destroyed, patients must be supplied with exogenous
testosterone. we feel these findings are important, as
we could find few reports regarding these pathological
effects of aas abuse.
our data indicate significant renal damage following aas administration as well. some studies indicate
the presence of androgen receptors in the kidney [30–
32], while another study suggests they are only present
within the urogenital tract [33]. data from the current
study suggest that aas affected the epithelial cells of
urinary tubules via an androgen-dependent mechanism
either directly or indirectly. however, biochemical examination indicated that renal function was normal
[20].
although heart obstruction was not considered to be
the cause of death in olympic athlete florence joyner,
data from our study indicates that cardiac damage

432

takahashi et al.

results from aas administration. significant inflammation was observed within the myocardium and
pericardium. it is likely that this could be the cause
of fatal arrhythmia in athletes who use aas. two
reports investigated the cardiac capillary bed of
testosterone-propionate administered female rats [34,
35]. although they observed the impairment of cardiac capillaries by aas, they did not report of any obstructions in the myocardial or pericardial region.
woodiwiss et al. used  xxxd2696xxx  administration in male rats, and reported that aas affected left
ventricle remolding [36]. they also reported negative
findings with regard to aas-induced cardiac damage,
although, the dose used was less than used in the
current study. regardless, the fact remains that many
athletes use large doses of aas, thus significantly
increasing their risk for sustaining cardiac damage.
although sudden death of unknown origin is sometimes reported, it is possible that this may be due to
aas-induced cardiac damage. in light of our current
findings, and those in previous reports regarding the
serious deleterious effects of aas on the myocardium,
this is a logical conclusion [37–40]. furthermore
marsh et al. reported that androgen receptors were
present in cardiac muscle [41]. our data clearly indicate that aas-induces negative cardiac effects. although experimental data obtained from animals
correlates well with data from human subjects, the
pathophysiology of adverse cardiovascular effects of
aas use is still poorly understood [42].
changes in hepatic tissue are typical following drug-

induced liver dysfunction. however, biochemical
examination has yet to reveal liver dysfunction under
these circumstances. boada et al. reported that high
doses of stanozolol treatment in male rats resulted in
inflammation or degeneration in central lobular hepatocytes and exert a proliferative effect on liver cells [43].
furthermore, there are some reports indicating that
levels of cytocrome p-450 in the liver are decreased
in male rats following aas administration [44].
the androgen secreting zona reticularis of the adrenal gland would most likely suffer damage following
aas abuse due to initiation of negative feedback mechanisms. furthermore, it was difficult to accurately
measure the weight of each adrenal gland due to its
small size. we speculate that the adrenal gland weight
among the groups was not statistically differentiated
because of this. bentvelsen et al. reported the presence of androgen receptors in the adrenal gland [33].
the results from our study corroborate these findings
as well.
in conclusion, aas administration has considerable
effects on various organs. we are unaware of any previously published reports regarding the pathological
state of aas abuse. furthermore, the degree of tissue
damage sustained by aas administration was much
greater than we originally hypothesized. in addition,
our data indicated a great imbalance in the endocrine
system as a result of aas administration. these results would strongly suggest that athletes should refrain from aas use if they wish to avoid these serious
deleterious effects.
