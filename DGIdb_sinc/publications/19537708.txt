the somatostatin analogue  xxxd3484xxx , which has a high binding affinity for the  xxxg2207xxx  receptor (somatostatin
receptor subtype 2) expressed on tumor cells, is used clinically for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of
neuroendocrine tumors and gastrointestinal disorders. there is growing interest in the development of multivalent
peptide systems, because they may have enhanced binding affinity compared to monovalent analogues. in this
report, we describe the design and synthesis of a series of  xxxd3484xxx -containing monomeric, dimeric, and
tetrameric dendrimeric conjugates. these multivalent dendrimeric cyclic peptides were obtained using cu(i)catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between peptidyl azides and dendrimeric alkynes. their affinities for the  xxxg2207xxx 
receptor were determined by a competitive binding assay on rat brain sections.

introduction
somatostatin is a cyclic peptide hormone, which circulates
in the blood in two biologically active forms:  xxxg2205xxx 
and its n-terminally extended form  xxxg2205xxx , consisting
of 14 and 28 amino acids, respectively (1-3). both hormones
exert different biological effects in the gastrointestinal system
and in the nervous system. these effects are mediated by highaffinity g protein-coupled somatostatin receptors (sstrs) and
include modulation of hormone release and neurotransmitter
release and inhibition of cell proliferation (4, 5). five different
sstr subtypes have been identified and characterized ( xxxg2206xxx -5)
(6). as some of these receptors are overexpressed in several
human tumors, especially neuroendocrine tumors and their
metastases, there is growing interest in the development of
potent analogues to target these receptors. the octapeptide
analogues  xxxd2770xxx  and octreotate, having high binding affinity
for  xxxg2207xxx -receptor-expressing tumor cells, are used clinically
for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neuroendocrine
tumors and gastrointestinal disorders (7-11).
much research has focused on the development of multivalent
dendrimeric molecules, because they show interesting properties
for enhancing the overall binding affinity compared to monovalent ligands (12-16). several research groups have prepared
multimers of cyclic arg-gly-asp (rgd) peptides and evaluated
theirbindingcharacteristicstowardthervbeta3 integrinreceptor(17-19).
our studies have shown that tumor uptake of a tetrameric rgd
dendrimer was significantly higher compared to that of the

monomeric and dimeric analogues, presumably due to enhanced
statistical rebinding (20, 21). these findings have inspired us
to prepare dendrimeric multivalent  xxxd2770xxx -based molecules.
on the basis of our experience with previously developed
dendrimeric conjugates (22-26), these  xxxd2770xxx -based dendrimers may have enhanced binding affinity for the  xxxg2207xxx 
receptor. the aim of this study was to synthesize multivalent
peptide dendrimers of  xxxd2770xxx , and to compare their in vitro
binding characteristics with monovalent congeners.
especially challenging is the efficient conjugation of these
biologically active peptides to the dendrimer. a fast coupling
reaction with high efficiency and chemoselectivity is desirable
to allow the conjugation of unprotected peptides to dendrimers
to obtain well-defined multivalent peptide dendrimers with
preservation of receptor binding affinity. several methodologies
have been investigated, and the huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (27) of an azide and an alkyne forming a triazole linkage
is particularly suitable for chemoselective bioconjugation reactions. the copper-catalyzed variant (28, 29), which regiospecifically gives 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles has led to many
applications ranging from therapeutics to macromolecules (30-35).
we recently showed that unprotected peptides could be efficiently attached to an alkyne-derivatized version of our earlier
developed dendrimers (36-39) using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (21, 40). thus, in this report we describe the
synthesis of multivalent dendrimeric  xxxd2770xxx  peptides from
dendrimeric alkynes and azido peptides. to evaluate the effect
of multivalency, the  xxxg2207xxx  receptor binding characteristics of
the corresponding monovalent, divalent, and tetravalent  xxxd2770xxx  peptide dendrimers were studied in comparison to
 xxxd2770xxx .

results and discussion
syntheses of cyclic  xxxd3484xxx  azides and dendrimeric alkynes. azido  xxxd2770xxx  4 was prepared on the solid phase
via fmoc/ xxxd3319xxx  chemistry protocols (46), as depicted in scheme
1. to enable click chemistry, an n-terminal azide functionality
was introduced via 6-azidohexanoic acid 1, which was prepared
from 6-bromohexanoic acid (52). the preparation of  xxxd2770xxx 
required a c-terminal threoninol derivative. for this purpose,
fmoc-protected threonine was reduced to its corresponding
alcohol 2 (53). following coupling of the protected threoninol,
peptide 3 was prepared on the solid phase, and 6-azidohexanoic
acid 1 was coupled to the n-terminal  xxxd1793xxx  before
cleavage from the resin. after cleavage and concomitant removal
of the side chain protection groups, the unprotected peptide 3
was obtained in an isolated yield of 29%. despite the fact that
the azide is susceptible to reduction in the presence of free thiols
as are present in cysteine-2 and cysteine-7, the synthesis and
subsequent ring closure by a dmso-mediated disulfide formation of the peptide proceeded without noticeable side reactions
and the azide remained stable throughout this procedure. thus,
linear peptide 3 was oxidized to the cyclic disulfide 4 by
treatment with dmso (47). after hplc purification, the cyclic
azido  xxxd2770xxx  4 was obtained in an overall yield of 23%.
several studies have reported on the convergent synthesis of
amino acid based dendrimers with peripheral propargyl groups
to enable a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (“click”) reaction with
peptide derived azides (21, 40). a similar methodology was
used here to prepare alkyne-derivatized dendrimers 5-7 and
their corresponding dota-conjugated derivatives 8-10 (figure
1) as a scaffold for the multimerization of  xxxd2770xxx .
conjugation of  xxxd2770xxx  to dendrimers by the click
cycloaddition reaction procedure. after obtaining azidefunctionalized  xxxd2770xxx  4 and alkynes 5-10, the stage was
set for the preparation of dendrimeric peptide systems using
chemoselective “click” chemistry, as shown in scheme 2. to
prove the concept, the first experiments were conducted with
alkynes 5-7 according to the literature procedure for microwaveassisted cycloaddition chemistry. azide 4 was reacted with
acetylene 5 in the presence of cuso4/na-ascorbate in dmf/
h2o (9:1 v/v) for 5-15 min under microwave irradiation. since
the rf values of the starting material and product were
comparable on tlc, hplc analysis was used to monitor the
progress of the click cycloaddition reaction. after 5 min at 100
°c, the monovalent cycloaddition conjugate 11 was formed.
different sources of copper catalyst, including cuoac and
activated copper-in-charcoal (cu/c) (48, 49), were used for
comparison to find the best procedure and to assess the
versatility of this approach. microwave-assisted cycloaddition
with any of the three cu(i)-sources afforded monovalent
cycloadducts in yields ranging from 40% to 70%, with cu/c
giving the highest yield. however, the use of cuoac showed

improved results in attaching peptidyl azide 4 to the divalent
alkyne 6 giving divalent  xxxd2770xxx  conjugate 12. therefore,
cuoac was chosen as the catalyst for the subsequent click
conjugation reaction with the tetravalent dendrimeric alkyne 7.
considerable amount of side products were observed during the
reactions toward divalent and especially tetravalent peptide
dendrimers, and lc-ms analyses showed most of these to be
incomplete cycloadducts. these incomplete conjugates hampered purification by hplc and resulted into a low isolated
yield of the desired product. the formation of 11 and 13 was
complete after 5 to 10 min microwave irradiation at 100 °c,
whereas the reaction time for 12 had to be extended to 20 min.

and 10.

it turned out that using an equimolar amount of cuoac gave
the best result for all cycloaddition reactions. when using more
equivalents of copper catalyst, increasing amounts of impurities
were detected by hplc. the identity of the cycloadducts 11-13
was confirmed by maldi-tof and the spectrum of cyclic
 xxxd2770xxx  tetramer 13 is shown in figure 2 as a representative
example.
scheme 3 shows the synthetic route toward dota-conjugated
 xxxd2770xxx  dendrimers 14, 15, and 16. in contrast to the synthesis
of conjugated peptide dendrimers 11-13, the dota moiety
of dendrimers 8-10 required a different copper catalyst, since
none of the above-mentioned cu(i)-sources resulted in the
desired products. fortunately, using a combination of cuso4
and copper powder as described by kessler and co-workers (50)
gave the desired conjugates in acceptable yields. figure 3 shows
the analytical hplc trace of azido  xxxd2770xxx  4 and alkyne 8
(a) and the resulting dota-conjugated  xxxd3319xxx -protected precursor
of 14 after the click reaction (b), respectively. conjugate 14
was obtained in 40% yield after purification. the isolated yields
for dimer 15 and tetramer 16 were 12% and 11%, respectively.
these relative low values were mainly due to the presence of
incomplete coupling products and concomitantly difficult purification to obtain the pure compound.
since a relatively high amount of copper had to be used
during the synthesis of 14, 15, and 16, cu-dota complexes
were formed in addition to the desired copper-free products, as
was inferred from the mass spectra. to remove residual copper
from the dota moieties, the product was treated with na2s
as described in the literature (50). this treatment, however,
reduced the disulfide bridges in  xxxd2770xxx , which had to be
restored by a reoxidation step in aqueous dmso. figure 4
shows the mass spectrum of conjugate 14 with no indication of
cu-dota complexes. however, mass analysis of either dimer
15 or tetramer 16 still clearly showed copper-bound adducts

to avoid copper contamination of the desired end-product,
since it is cytotoxic toward mammalian cells and also hampers
efficient loading of the dota moiety with radioactive metals,
approaches toward metal-free azide-alkyne cycloadditions are
particularly relevant (54). in a recent paper by rutjes and coworkers (55), it was shown that a copper-free tandem 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition retro-diels-alder ligation enabled the efficient

receptor binding assay. binding affinities toward the
somatostatin receptor of the mono-, di-, and tetravalent dota
conjugates of  xxxd2770xxx  14, 15, and 16, respectively, were
determined by a competitive binding assay on rat  xxxg2207xxx -positive
brain cryostat sections, using [111in-dota0,tyr3]octreotate as a
radiotracer. figure 5 represents a typical example of an autoradiogram, in which [111in-dota0,tyr3]octreotate was displaced by
tetravalent  xxxd2770xxx  dendrimer 13 (first and second column) and
azido  xxxd2770xxx  4 (third and fourth column) in a concentration
range from 10-10 to 10-5 m (from top to bottom) in two
independent experiments. the autoradiograms were quantified, and
the ic50 values were calculated from fitted sigmoidal displacement
curves as shown in figure 6 and summarized in table 1. on the
basis of these data, it became clear that the ic50 values of conjugate
14, dimer 15, and tetramer 16 were all within the low nanomolar
range. however, no significant increase in receptor affinity for the
tetramer 16 compared to either dimer 15 or conjugate 14 could be
measured. a possible explanation for the absence of the multivalency effect may be found in the nonoptimized spacer-arm length
either between the dota chelator and the dendrimeric core or
between the dendrimer core and the peptide. however, it is known
from our earlier work that elongating the spacer-arm length,
between the dendrimer core and the carbohydrate moiety of a

divalent galabiose derivative, resulted in a 2-fold increase in ic50
value for the inhibition of streptococcus suis bacteria (23),
compared to the analogue without a spacer. therefore, the present
dendrimeric systems of the  xxxd2770xxx  cyclic peptide may not be
ideal for augmenting receptor binding. furthermore, the importance
of the linker or other solubilizing moieties connected directly to
the dendrimer scaffold was also apparent from similar binding

experiments using conjugates 11-13 without the dota-moiety
(supporting information table si 1 and figure si 10). the resulting
ic50 values found for conjugate 11 and dimer 12 were higher than
those for their corresponding dota conjugates 14 and 15;
probably, a poor aqueous solubility of tetramer 13 prevented even
the calculation of a reliable ic50 value. incorporating the dota
moiety, which contains three hydrophilic carboxylic acid func-

tion (“click”) reaction leading to the successful synthesis of
multivalent  xxxd2770xxx -based dendrimers, either in the absence
or in the presence of the strong metal chelating dota
moiety. this conjugation method represents a chemoselective
approach for the preparation of these dendrimeric peptides
from unprotected cyclic peptidyl azides and dendrimeric
alkynes. we have tested the hypothesis regarding whether
functionalization of our dota-conjugated dendrimeric alkynes
8-10 with  xxxd2770xxx  4 will augment the binding affinity
between receptor and multivalent ligand. competitive binding
assays showed no significant increase in receptor affinity for
the dota-conjugated tetramer 16 or dimer 15 compared to

1330 bioconjugate chem., vol. 20, no. 7, 2009

the monomer 14. the role of the spacer between the scaffold
and the cyclic peptide could play a major role in improving
binding affinity of the dimeric and tetrameric conjugates, and
this aspect is currently under investigation. furthermore, to
ensure an efficient radiolabeling, alternative copper-free
“click” approaches to obtain dota-conjugated multimeric
 xxxd2770xxx  dendrimers are currently being developed in our
laboratory.
