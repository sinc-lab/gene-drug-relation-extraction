abstract:  xxxd3399xxx  is a selective  xxxd3495xxx  (avp)  xxxg231xxx  blocker used to induce
free water diuresis in the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. currently the
orally active medication is in the ﬁnal stages prior to approval by the fda for outpatient therapy.
it appears to be safe and effective at promoting aquaresis and raising serum sodium levels in
both short- and long-term studies.  xxxd3399xxx  is also effective for treatment of congestive heart
failure (chf) exacerbation, but whether there are long standing beneﬁcial effects on chf is
still controversial. prolonged use of  xxxd3399xxx  leads to increased endogenous levels of avp and
perhaps over-stimulation of v1a receptors. theoretically this activation could lead to increased
afterload and cardiac myocyte ﬁbrosis, causing progression of chf. however, after 52 weeks of
 xxxd3399xxx  therapy there was no worsening of left ventricular dilatation. in addition,  xxxd3399xxx  is
metabolized by the cyp3a4 system; thus physicians should be aware of the potential for increased
interactions with other medications.  xxxd3399xxx  is a breakthrough in the therapy of hyponatremia as
it directly combats elevated avp levels associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion
of  xxxd3495xxx , congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis of the liver.

volume overload and hyponatremia cause signiﬁcant morbidity and may lead to increased
mortality in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx  (siadh),
congestive heart failure (chf), and liver cirrhosis (lee et al 2003). elevated levels of
 xxxd3495xxx  (avp or  xxxd3495xxx ) contribute to this state of total body
water excess and hyponatremia (goldsmith et al 1983). diuretics and free water restriction
have historically been used to combat this condition but have unwanted side effects
including electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and renal failure. vasopressin receptor
antagonists (vras or “vaptans”) directly target stimulated avp receptors in the collecting
duct of the kidney, down-regulating aquaporin insertion and free water absorption.
 xxxd3399xxx , an oral v2-receptor speciﬁc antagonist, has been very effective and safe in
outpatient trials in treating hyponatremia and volume overload. it was recently approved
by the emea (european medicines agency) for use in europe. the us fda has recommended  xxxd3399xxx  for the treatment of hyponatremia, but it is currently not approved for
use in the us. presently, only intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  has been approved by the fda for
the short-term treatment (4 days) of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. unfortunately,
the lack of follow-up therapy signiﬁcantly limits the usage of  xxxd1747xxx . an efﬁcacious
oral agent would be ideal for the outpatient management of chronic hyponatremia.

regulation of vasopressin
avp or  xxxd3495xxx  (adh) is produced in the hypothalamus and delivered
to the posterior pituitary for release into systemic circulation. secretion of avp is

mediated by several mechanisms. osmotic pressure is the
most sensitive stimulus for avp release and is mediated by
osmoreceptors in the hypothalmus. sodium concentration
greatly inﬂuences osmotic pressure. a decrease in osmolality
as minimal as 1% to 2% rapidly suppresses avp secretion
and induces aquaresis. arterial pressure reduction also stimulates avp release, but typically there must be a signiﬁcant
reduction of 10% to 20% as sensed by baroreceptors in the
left atrium and aorta. it appears that arterial pressure provokes
avp release by lowering the set point of the osmoregulatory
system (schrier 2007). heart failure and cirrhosis cause an
arterial underﬁlling, stimulating avp release, and overriding
hypo-osmolality-induced avp inhibition (lien and shapiro
2007). the result is hyponatremia in the face of total body
volume overload. as for siadh, the excessive release of
vasopressin is independent of osmolality and volume status.
patients exhibit mild volume overload due to water retention
and signiﬁcant hyponatremia as a consequence.

vasopressin receptors
avp stimulates both v1a and v2 receptors. v1a receptors
are located in vascular smooth muscle and cause arterial
vasoconstriction to compensate for low arterial pressure.
avp exerts its anti-diuretic effect by stimulating the v2
receptor located on the basolateral side of the principal
cell in the cortical collecting duct. avp v2 is a g proteincoupled receptor, which when stimulated initiates adenylate
cyclase and leads to increased intracellular camp (lien
and shapiro 2007). elevated camp signals placement of
vesicle-encased aquaporin-2 channels in the principal cell
apical membrane, facilitating free water absorption in the
collecting tubule. most of the “vaptans,” including  xxxd3399xxx ,
are  xxxg231xxx -selective, except  xxxd1747xxx , which blocks
both receptors.

pharmacological actions
of  xxxd3399xxx 
 xxxd3399xxx  (study name  xxxd3399xxx ) is an orally active,
non-peptide, selective  xxxg231xxx  antagonist that blocks
avp binding and promotes free water excretion. the
comparisons and interactions between vras and diuretics
are clinically important because diuretics are likely to be
used in conjunction with  xxxd3399xxx . shoaf et al (2007)
performed a pilot, randomized, cross-over study to determine
the pharmacologic interactions between  xxxd3399xxx  and
furosemide or hydroclorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) (shoaf et al 2007).
twelve healthy young caucasian men were randomized to
receive 30 mg of  xxxd3399xxx , then 80 mg of furosemide (6) or

1150

100 mg of  xxxd2294xxx  (6), and ﬁnally both medications together.
a 48-hour washout period was observed between therapies.
multiple measurements were gathered including urinary
output, electrolyte concentrations of plasma and urine,
and neurohormone levels in addition to pharmacological
parameters.  xxxd3399xxx  alone had a 50% increase in 24-hour
urine output compared with furosemide and  xxxd2294xxx  (dosed
once daily). urinary sodium was 50% greater during
furosemide and  xxxd2294xxx  therapy in comparison to  xxxd3399xxx .
kaluresis did not differ largely between drugs. plasma
levels of sodium increased during therapy with  xxxd3399xxx 
and decreased with furosemide and  xxxd2294xxx . renin activity
was increased at 24 hours post dose for all patients treated
with furosemide,  xxxd2294xxx , or a combination of either with
 xxxd3399xxx .  xxxd3399xxx  alone had negligible increases in renin
activity but did show increased avp levels at 24 hours.
despite increased avp levels, blood pressure did not differ
in patients treated with  xxxd3399xxx . interestingly, the maximum
 xxxd3399xxx  concentration (cmax) and area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (auc∞) was increased for  xxxd3399xxx 
plus furosemide, but urinary and hemodynamic parameters
were unchanged. there was no additive effect with diuretic
adjunct therapy in this study.

 xxxd3399xxx  for treating hyponatremia
salt 1 and 2 (study of ascending levels of  xxxd3399xxx 
in hyponatremia) were designed to focus speciﬁcally on
changes in serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia
from multiple disorders including siadh, heart failure
and cirrhosis (shrier et al 2006). two separate randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 200 to 250 patients
were performed to determine reproducibility. patients were
randomized to  xxxd3399xxx  treatment (with dose adjustment
from 15 to 60 mg as needed) versus placebo and treated
for 30 days with follow-up assessment at 1 week post
completion. the area-under-the-curve (auc) for increase
in sodium levels from baseline to day 4 and day 30 was
significantly greater in the  xxxd3399xxx  versus placebo
treatment group (p ⬍ 0.001). the average baseline serum
sodium in both groups was 128 mmol/l. at day 4, tolvaptantreated patients had an average sodium of 134 and placebo
130 mmol/l (p ⬍ 0.001). serum sodium rose to an average
of 136 mmol/l in the  xxxd3399xxx  group at day 30, but was
unchanged in the placebo group. the greatest difference
was in patients with marked hyponatremia. side effects
were minimal and included dry mouth and increased thirst.
overcorrection of hyponatremia (⬎0.5 mmol/l/h) occurred
in less than 2% of  xxxd3399xxx -treated patients, yet none

of them developed central pontine myelinolysis. once
 xxxd3399xxx  was discontinued at day 30, serum sodium levels
returned to similar levels or below those of their placebo
counterparts.
 xxxd3399xxx  therapy versus fluid restriction for the
treatment of hyponatremia was studied by gheorghiade et al
(2006). twenty-eight hospitalized subjects with a serum
sodium ⬍135 mmol/l were randomized to  xxxd3399xxx  alone
(17) versus ﬂuid restriction of 1200 ml/day (11) for 27 days.
 xxxd3399xxx  doses were increased from 15 to 60 mg/day as
needed to increase serum sodium levels. the primary endpoint
was normalization of serum sodium (⬎135 mmol/l) or
an increase ⱖ10% from baseline. normalization of serum
sodium occurred in 50% of patients by day 4 when treated
with  xxxd3399xxx  and by day 8 on ﬂuid restriction (p ⬍ 0.03).
serum sodium increased 5.7 ± 3.2 mmol/l in the tolvaptantreated group and 1.0 ± 4.7 mmol/l in the ﬂuid-restriction
group (p = 0.0065). clearly  xxxd3399xxx  showed superiority in
treating hyponatremia compared with ﬂuid restriction alone.
as patients are likely to be non-compliant with ﬂuid restriction,
 xxxd3399xxx  is likely to be very successful in outpatients.

effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on congestive
heart failure: short-term effects
congestive heart failure is a common cause of hyponatremia
and associated with elevated avp levels (goldsmith

et al 1983).  xxxd3399xxx  has largely been studied in the setting
of chf as a novel way to treat chf exacerbations and
perhaps alter the natural course of heart failure. three major
studies that investigated short-term effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on
chf and related hyponatremia are summarized in table 1.
gheorghiade et al (2003) reported the ﬁrst randomized,
double-blinded trial of  xxxd3399xxx  in patients with symptomatic
heart failure. in this study, 254 patients with nyha class i, ii
or iii chf were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd3399xxx  30,
45 or 60 mg versus placebo for 25 days. patients were kept
on stable doses of chf ameliorating medications including
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors/angiotensin
receptor blockers (ace-i/arb), beta-blockers, and
furosemide and allowed to drink ﬂuids freely. weight loss
was approximately –0.8 kg for patients treated with  xxxd3399xxx 
(regardless of dose) versus a gain of +0.3 kg for placebo at
day 1 (p ⬍ 0.001 for all groups and placebo). patients maintained this weight reduction at day 25 but did not lose further
weight while on  xxxd3399xxx . signiﬁcant aquaresis was noted in
the  xxxd3399xxx  groups in comparison to placebo. urine output
measured approximately 4 l/day on therapy with  xxxd3399xxx 
and only 2 l/day with placebo, while urine osmolality
decreased in  xxxd3399xxx  groups and increased in the placebo
group. hyponatremic enrollees had larger increases in serum
sodium than normonatremic counterparts. eighty-two percent
of the hyponatremic  xxxd3399xxx  enrollees attained a normal

serum sodium level by the end of the 25 days. although not
statistically signiﬁcant, avp concentrations were higher in
 xxxd3399xxx -treated patients than placebo. again, there were
no differences in blood pressure measurements between
both groups.
gheorghiade et al (2004) then launched a larger,
randomized trial of  xxxd3399xxx  in hospitalized patients
with congestive failure exacerbation, the activ in chf
investigation (acute and chronic therapeutic impact of
a vasopressin antagonist in congestive heart failure).
three hundred nineteen patients with reduced ejection
fraction (⬍40%) and persistence of congestive symptoms
despite standard therapy with diuretics were randomized
to tolvaptatn 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg daily, or placebo for up
to 60 days. patients were continued on other chf therapy
including diuretics, ace-i/arb, and beta-blockers. the
acute primary outcome was change in body weight at
24 hours.  xxxd3399xxx  showed signiﬁcant decreases in mean
body weight (regardless of dose) in comparison to placebo.
serum sodium increased by approximately 3 meq/l for
 xxxd3399xxx -treated patients and decreased by −0.2 meq/l in
the placebo group. patients with underlying hyponatremia
that were treated with  xxxd3399xxx  often had a normalization
of their serum sodium levels. at time of discharge, dyspnea
scores were signiﬁcantly improved in the  xxxd3399xxx  treatment
arm (p = 0.04).
the third study was the everest trial (efﬁcacy of
vasopressin antagonism in heart failure outcome study
with  xxxd3399xxx ), which also examined short- and long-term
effects of  xxxd3399xxx  therapy in patients with chf exacerbation
(cheorghiade et al 2007). two identical randomized,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials (a and b) of
2000+ patients with worsening heart failure symptoms were
performed in north america, south america, and europe.
patients were given appropriate therapy with diuretics,
ace-i/arb, beta-blocker at the discretion of investigators
and then randomized to receive 30 mg of  xxxd3399xxx  versus
placebo. primary outcomes included body weight at day 7 or
discharge (whichever came ﬁrst) and changes in clinical status
measured with a visual analog scale. weight reduction was
signiﬁcantly reduced in patients treated with  xxxd3399xxx  versus
placebo at day 1 and day 7 or discharge (p ⬍ 0.001 for all
comparisons). secondary outcomes, including self-reported
dyspnea at day 1 and lower extremity edema evaluated by
clinicians, were improved on  xxxd3399xxx  (p ⬍ 0.05 except
edema evaluation in trial a). serum sodium elevated a mean
of 3.3 meq/l at day 1 and remained elevated 2.0 meq/l at
day 7 or discharge in  xxxd3399xxx -treated groups and dropped

1152

in placebo groups (p ⬍ 0.001). the change in serum sodium
was most impressive in patients with a baseline serum sodium
⬍134 meq/l at randomization. for this group, those receiving
 xxxd3399xxx  had a serum sodium increase of 5.5 meq/l at day
7 or discharge, while those of placebo had an elevation of
1.9 meq/l (p ⬍ 0.001) (konstam et al 2007). despite signiﬁcantly more thirst and dry mouth in the  xxxd3399xxx  groups there
were no other differences in adverse effects. no increased
incidence of hypotension, arrhythmia, renal failure, or
electrolyte abnormality was noted in  xxxd3399xxx -treated patients.
the short-term arm of everest study complemented the
results shown 3 years earlier in activ in chf.
the short-term effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on renal hemodynamics
in chf patients have been compared with furosemide and
placebo by costello-boerrigter et al (2005). the randomized,
placebo-controlled crossover study investigated the changes
in urine output, sodium and potassium excretion, renal
blood ﬂow (rbf), and glomerular ﬁltration rate (gfr) in
14 patients with stable class ii or iii heart failure and ejection
fraction ⬍40%. patients received either  xxxd3399xxx  30 mg or
placebo on day 1 and then were crossed to receive the other
medication on day 3. both groups then received 80 mg of
furosemide on day 5 for comparison. all other chf medications including maintenance ace-i/arb, beta-blockers,
aspirin, and diuretics were held prior to the start of the study.
patients were maintained on similar sodium-restricted diets
and were given water at prescribed points during the day. no
raw data were available in the study text, but analysis noting
statistical signiﬁcance was reported. urine output increased
signiﬁcantly with  xxxd3399xxx  and furosemide treatment versus
placebo, but there was no advantage between the two. urinary
sodium and potassium excretion was statistically greater in
furosemide than in  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo treatment. urine
osmolality was lowest in  xxxd3399xxx , signiﬁcantly reduced
from placebo (p ⬍ 0.05) but not from furosemide treatment
(p = 0.10). renal blood ﬂow, measured by pah clearance,
was signiﬁcantly lower in furosemide therapy than  xxxd3399xxx 
and placebo. renal blood ﬂow actually was mildly increased
from placebo (p = 0.19) in  xxxd3399xxx  treatement. finally,
gfr (measured by inulin clearance) was similar between
all three therapies. neurohormonal measurements at 0.5
and 2.5 hours after medication administration were also
attained – avp, renin, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide,
beta natriuretic peptide, and norepinephrine. avp levels were
similar among the three treatment groups (likely related to
short duration of  xxxd3399xxx  therapy), with only a signiﬁcant
increase in plasma renin activity in furosemide versus placebo
but not furosemide versus  xxxd3399xxx . the authors concluded

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(6)

 xxxd3399xxx  for hyponatremia

that  xxxd3399xxx  was a safe aquaretic similar in efﬁcacy to
furosemide therapy for mild to moderate chf.
in summary, aquaresis and elevations in serum sodium,
especially in hyponatremic patients, were well-documented in
short-term investigations. there was no dose-related improvement in weight loss, serum sodium increase, or chf symptoms
with escalating doses of  xxxd3399xxx . for that reason, a single
dose of 30 mg daily was used for many subsequent studies.

effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on congestive
heart failure: long-term effects
long-term effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on morbidity and mortality
associated with chf have not been validated. as mentioned
earlier, both the activ in chf and the everest studies
examined long-term outcomes. in a third study, by udelson
et al (2005), left ventricular end diastolic volume (lvedv)
and other parameters were measured while on  xxxd3399xxx . the
results of these three studies are summarized in table 2.
in the activ in chf study, the long-term primary
outcome (60 days) was worsening chf, deﬁned as death,
chf-related hospitalization, or unscheduled physician visit.
there were no differences in worsening heart failure between
the  xxxd3399xxx  groups versus placebo.  xxxd3399xxx -treated
patients tended to require less maintenance diuretic than
their placebo counterparts. a post hoc analysis identiﬁed
2 groups with improved 60-day mortality on  xxxd3399xxx  in
comparison with placebo. these groups were patients with
elevated blood urea nitrogen levels (p = 0.07) and severe
congestive symptoms (p = 0.03).  xxxd3399xxx  appeared very
safe, with minimal side effects. there was no increased
incidence of electrolyte abnormalities or renal failure with
extended  xxxd3399xxx  therapy. common side effects included
dry mouth, thirst, and urinary frequency but these were not
statistically signiﬁcant compared with placebo.

in the everest study, the long-term primary endpoints
were all-cause mortality and the composite of cardiac-related
death and hospitalization for chf (konstam et al 2007).
primary events were not different in the two groups after
a mean follow-up time of 9.9 months. again an increase
in serum sodium levels was noted in patients treated with
 xxxd3399xxx , and this increase was maintained through 40 weeks
of therapy. the authors concluded that  xxxd3399xxx  had no longterm effect on chf morbidity or mortality.
in the third study, udelson et al (2005) performed a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
240 patients with chf on standard therapy randomized to
 xxxd3399xxx  30 mg versus placebo for 52 weeks. in addition to
clinical outcomes, they measured lvedv by radionuclide
ventriculography and the plasma levels of avp, brain
natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and renin at weeks
28 and 52. progressive left ventricular dilatation occurs in the
natural course of heart failure, a process that has been slowed,
or possibly reversed, by ace-i/arb and beta-blocker
therapy. based on previous studies, it was unclear how
 xxxd3399xxx  would affect ongoing lv dilatation. on one hand,
gheorghiade’s earlier studies suggested a survival beneﬁt for
patients receiving  xxxd3399xxx  with severe congestive symptoms
(gheorghiade et al 2004). on the other, the question of
unopposed v1a activity and increased avp levels as a result
of v2 blockade was concerning as excessive  xxxg229xxx 
activity may contribute to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and
ﬁbrosis (costello-boerrigter et al 2005). this could then
lead to further dilatation of the ventricles in patients with
chf. udelson et al (2005) found that there was no change in
lvedv in the placebo group and a non-signiﬁcant decrease
(−1.8 ± 10.7 ml/m2) in  xxxd3399xxx -treated patients at the end of
52 weeks (p = 0.21 compared with baseline lvedv). avp
levels were signiﬁcantly elevated in the  xxxd3399xxx -treated

arm, but no other differences in neurohormones were noted.
during the investigation, there were 6 deaths and 21 heart
failure-related hospitalizations in the  xxxd3399xxx  group versus
11 deaths and 34 hospitalizations in the placebo group. there
was a signiﬁcant advantage of  xxxd3399xxx  on mortality and
chf hospitalization in a time-to-event analysis (p ⬍ 0.03
by log-rank test). these secondary ﬁndings contradict those
from the activ in chf and everest trials, which showed
no long-term beneﬁcial effects of  xxxd3399xxx .

synergic effects between  xxxd3399xxx 
and diuretics
in the study of shoaf et al (2007),  xxxd3399xxx  did not
demonstrate any synergy with furosemide or  xxxd2294xxx  in
healthy subjects. it should be mentioned that healthy
subjects do not have elevated avp levels or an activated
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, therefore, the additive
effects are likely to be limited. in patients with chf or
cirrhosis of the liver, these hormones are highly elevated as
a compensatory mechanism for arterial underﬁlling (schrier
2007). diuretics were used in ⬎90% of patients in the
previously described chf studies (gheorghiade et al 2003,
2004, 2007; konstam et al 2007). clearly the addition of
 xxxd3399xxx  to diuretics in treatment arms caused an increase
in urine output compared with placebo plus diuretics. to
further conﬁrm the synergic effect, comparisons between
 xxxd3399xxx  alone versus  xxxd3399xxx  plus diuretics in patients
with chf or cirrhosis are needed.

choice of vaptans for cirrhosis
and congestive heart failure
v1a +  xxxg231xxx  versus v2 blockade alone in the setting
of chf and cirrhosis is another clinical question that needs
further clarification. due to v1a blockade,  xxxd1747xxx 
tends to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (not
statistically signiﬁcant) (ghali et al 2006). v1a receptors are
abundant in the splanchnic circulation. in cirrhosis, a disease
process characterized by pathologic vasodilation of this
circulation, v1a blockade would be harmful. theoretically,
 xxxg231xxx  speciﬁc antagonists such as  xxxd3399xxx  would be
a better choice than  xxxd1747xxx  for treating cirrhosis-related
hyponatremia. as for chf, non-selective avp antagonists
may have advantages (goldsmith 2007). long-term use
of  xxxd3399xxx  is associated with an increase in endogenous
avp levels (udelson et al 2005). this could potentially lead
to unopposed v1a activation and an increase in afterload.
animal models have shown that myocardial cells contain
v1a receptors and activation could trigger myocyte ﬁbrosis

(costello-boerrigter et al 2005). per the study by udelson
et al (2005), there did not appear to be differences in
ventricular structure after 1 year of therapy with  xxxd3399xxx .
this argues against significant myocyte fibrosis with
unopposed v1a activity.  xxxd1747xxx  may be a better choice
in chf, but unfortunately the oral preparation has shown
dramatic cyp3a4 inhibition, drug–drug interaction, and is
not being developed by drug companies as a result (ghali
et al 2006). clearly, trials that investigate and advantage of
v1a +  xxxg231xxx  versus v2 blockade in chf are needed.

drug–drug interactions
 xxxd3399xxx  is metabolized by the cyp3a4 system and
therefore levels of the drug could be elevated with
coadministration of p450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole
and amiodarone (shoaf et al 2005). although  xxxg231xxx 
antagonists have less cyp3a4 interaction in comparison
to  xxxd1747xxx , the maximal plasma concentration (cmax)
was increased by 248%, and auc (area under the plasma
concentration versus time curve) 440% when  xxxd3399xxx  was
given along with ketoconazole (unpublished data). as many
chf patients that could beneﬁt from  xxxd3399xxx  are also taking
amiodarone, this is an important drug interaction to investigate. shoaf et al (2005) examined the question of interaction
between  xxxd3399xxx  and amiodarone in 2005. patients maintained on oral amiodarone 200 mg daily for ⬎10 months were
given subsequent doses of  xxxd3399xxx  (30 mg day 3, 90 mg
day 4) while amiodarone and its metabolite desethylamoidarone disposition (dea) levels were monitored. there was
no signiﬁcant change in these plasma markers for pre- versus
post- xxxd3399xxx  dosing days.  xxxd3399xxx  concentrations were
also measured and compared with previously gathered levels
in chf patients. again no signiﬁcant difference was noted
in patients simultaneously receiving amiodarone. however,
more studies are needed to determine whether long-term
treatment with  xxxd3399xxx  would have clinically signiﬁcant
effects due to drug drug–interaction.

conclusions
vasopressin receptor antagonists have clearly been the most
exciting medications to come forth in the nephrology ﬁeld for
some time.  xxxd3399xxx  shows great promise in treating patients
with hyponatremia. despite minimal risk for overcorrection
of sodium in the ﬁrst 24 hours, it appears to be quite safe.
increased thirst and dry mouth are common, but were not
severe enough for patients to stop therapy in trials. with
non-compliance a huge obstacle in ﬂuid restriction therapy,
 xxxd3399xxx  appears a better option. patients with chf show

 xxxd3399xxx  for hyponatremia

increased urine output and weight loss with  xxxd3399xxx . in
acute decompensated heart failure  xxxd3399xxx  will likely be
very helpful in ameliorating symptoms and reducing length
of hospital stay. however, long-term improvement in chf
morbidity and mortality has not been proved. once approved
by the fda,  xxxd3399xxx  is likely to have signiﬁcant impact on
clinical management of hyponatremia regardless of cause.
