abstract

purpose: abt-751is anoral antimitotic agent that binds to the  xxxd1740xxx  site on h-tubulin. a phase
1study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of abt-751in
patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias.
study design: thirty-two patients were treated: nine with 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 3), or 150
mg/m2 (n = 3) of abt-751 given orally once daily for 7 days every 3 weeks and 23 with 75
(n = 3), 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 5), 150 (n = 5), 175 (n = 3), or 200 mg/m2 (n = 4) of abt-751
given orally once daily for 21 days every 4 weeks. consenting patients had pharmacogenetic
sampling and enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (cec).
results: dose-limiting toxicity consisted of ileus in one patient at 200 mg/m2, with a subsequent
patient developing grade 2 constipation at the same dose level. one patient with relapsed acute
myelogenous leukemia achieved a complete remission that was sustained for 2 months. four
other patients had transient hematologic improvements, consisting of a decrease in peripheral
blood blasts and improvements in platelet counts. cec number was reduced in three patients with
a concomitant reduction in peripheral blasts. a previously undescribed nonsynonymous single
nucleotide polymorphism, encoding ala185thr, was identified in exon 4 of the h-tubulin gene,
 xxxg2352xxx , in three other patients. the recommended phase 2 dose in hematologic malignancies is
175 mg/m2 daily orally for 21days every 4 weeks.
conclusion: further assessment of abt-751, especially in combination with other agents, in
patients with acute leukemias is warranted.

microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton and
are important for a variety of cellular processes, including
maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport, and
segregation of chromosomes during cell division by mitotic
spindle formation (1). the mitotic spindle is composed of
microtubules and therefore is sensitive to alterations in
microtubule dynamics. microtubules are dynamic polymers,
composed of a – tubulin and h-tubulin heterodimers, which
constantly undergo growth (polymerization) or shortening

(destabilization). agents that bind to tubulin and disrupt
microtubule dynamics block cell cycle progression at the g2m phase with resultant apoptosis. these antimitotic agents
can be classified into three distinct groups based on their
tubulin binding domains: the vinca domain (e.g., vincristine,
vinblastine,  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx , and cryptophycin 52), the taxane
domain (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, and epothilones), and the
 xxxd1740xxx  site (e.g., abt-751, ci-980, and combretastatins;
refs. 2 – 7).
vinca alkaloids have shown efficacy in hematologic malignancies, whereas taxanes are more effective in solid tumors. the
use of either class of agents is frequently limited by the
development of resistance, which may be mediated by overexpression of membrane transporter proteins, such as
p-glycoprotein encoded by the  xxxg10xxx  gene. abt-751 (previously known as e7010) is an orally available antimitotic
methoxybenzene sulfonamide agent (fig. 1.) that binds
preferentially and competitively to the  xxxd1740xxx  site of the
h3 isoform of tubulin with a k i of 3.3 amol/l and inhibits
microtubule polymerization with an ic50 value of 3.1 amol/l
(8 – 11). abt-751 is not a multidrug resistance substrate (12).
in preclinical studies, abt-751 inhibited cellular proliferation
of a broad range of human tumor cell lines and xenograft
models (9, 13), including those that are paclitaxel and
doxorubicin resistant due to the multidrug-resistant phenotype.

consecutive days during a 21-day cycle or 21 consecutive days
during a 28-day cycle, the maximum plasma concentration
(c max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve
over a dosing interval (aucs ) increased proportionally with
increasing doses, indicating linear pharmacokinetics (12). abt751 was rapidly absorbed following oral dosing with the time to
c max (t max) of f2 hours. abt-751 had a half-life of f5 hours
and showed minimal accumulation after daily or twice-daily
dosing (12). efficacious concentrations (0.5-1.5 ag/ml) in
preclinical models were achieved in all dose groups (12).
a phase 1 study was conducted to determine the safety and
tolerability of abt-751 in patients with refractory or relapsed
acute leukemias or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome. in
addition, in consenting patients, additional blood samples were
collected to assess b-tubulin gene mutations and levels of cecs
and circulating epcs at baseline and at various treatment time
points.

patients and methods
similar to other tubulin-destabilizing agents, such as  xxxd1740xxx , the vinca alkaloids, and  xxxd1744xxx , high doses of
abt-751 selectively reduce tumor blood flow and induce tumor
necrosis, with negligible effects on normal vascular function
(14 – 19). this vascular effect may be independent of a direct
cytotoxic effect on tumor cells (19). it is unclear whether this is
mediated by antiangiogenesis, as has been reported for several
microtubule inhibitors (20 – 23).
increased angiogenesis, determined by greater microvessel
density and elevated surrogate angiogenic markers such as
 xxxg2413xxx , is observed in acute
leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (24 – 28) and may
predict outcome (27 – 29). microvessel density in bone marrow
biopsies and levels of angiogenic factors, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor, do not reliably reflect total tumor
angiogenic activity (30). conditioned media from primary
acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) cultures can enhance endothelial cell proliferation (31). increased plasma vascular
endothelial growth factor levels have been correlated with
endothelial precursor/progenitor cell (epc) mobilization
(32, 33). circulating endothelial cells (cec) and circulating
epcs that originate from the bone marrow contribute to tumor
angiogenesis by incorporating into newly forming blood vessels
to support tumor growth and metastasis (34 – 38). unlike
terminally differentiated cecs that detach from the vessel walls,
enter the circulation after vascular injury, and have a limited
proliferation capacity, epcs are able to form highly proliferative
endothelial colonies when exposed to angiogenic factors
(36, 39 – 41). cecs can be detected at elevated concentrations
in patients with cancer (32, 33, 35) and with a variety of
nonmalignant disorders (36 – 38) compared with healthy
controls (32). in some patients with cancer, achievement of
complete remission correlated with reductions in the number of
cecs to levels comparable with those observed in healthy
controls (32). these findings provide a strong basis for
investigating cecs and circulating epcs as pharmacodynamic
markers of efficacy for cancer drugs and for cancer surveillance.
abt-751 is currently being evaluated in patients with
advanced solid tumors (42, 43). in phase 1 studies of abt751 given to adults with solid tumors for either seven

patients. adults with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of
aml, acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (mds; refractory anemia with excess blasts
or refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation)
refractory to standard therapy, or for whom no standard
therapy was available, were eligible for enrollment. other
inclusion criteria were adequate performance status (eastern
cooperative oncology group, 0-2), age >16 years, and
adequate hepatic and renal function. all patients had to
practice effective birth control and give written informed
consent indicating that they were aware of the investigational
nature of the study, in keeping with the policies of the m.d.
anderson cancer center.
study design. this was a phase 1 trial designed to determine
the safety and tolerability of oral abt-751 in patients with
hematologic malignancies. based on preliminary experience
from phase 1 trials conducted in patients with solid tumors, the
initial dose level was 100 mg/m2 orally once daily for 7 days
every 3 weeks (i.e., 7 of 21 days; refs. 19 – 21). after the first
three cohorts were accrued, preliminary clinical experience
from a phase 1 trial conducted in solid tumors indicated that a
21-day regimen followed by 7 days off drug was well tolerated
(43). preclinical models had shown enhanced tumor activity
with chronic dosing on a 21- to 28-day schedule (12).
therefore, after approval by the institutional review board,
the treatment schema was modified to an initial dose level of
75 mg/m2 daily orally for 21 days every 4 weeks (i.e., 21 of 28
days). patients were assigned successively to one of six dose
cohorts, which ranged from 75 to 200 mg/m2/d. doses were
escalated by 25 mg/m2/d per dose level.
complete blood counts were obtained at least weekly. bone
marrow assessments were done once every 2 to 3 weeks during
the first cycle of treatment and then once every 2 to 4 weeks
thereafter, as clinically indicated until remission, at which time
they were done after every cycle. patients without evidence of
disease progression or unacceptable drug-related toxicity were
eligible to receive additional cycles of treatment.
for dose escalation to occur, three assessable patients had to
complete their first cycle without a dose-limiting toxicity (dlt).
with each dlt, three additional assessable patients had to be

abt-751 in refractory hematologic malignancies

accrued, and further escalation could occur only if no more
dlts were observed. hematologic dlt was defined using the
national cancer institute common toxicity criteria version 2.0
(44) as myelosuppression with bone marrow hypoplasia
(cellularity <5%) without evidence of leukemia for z42 days.
nonhematologic dlt was defined as any grade z3 adverse
event, except for the following: nausea and vomiting z grade 3,
drug-related fever of any grade, alopecia, or clinically insignificant biochemical abnormalities. maximum tolerated dose was
defined as the highest dose for which the incidence of dlt was
v33%.
assessment of toxicity and response. all patients were
evaluable for toxicity if they received at least one dose of
abt-751. evaluation of response was done at the end of each
cycle of treatment. a complete response (cr) required
disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to disease,
normalization of the peripheral counts (absolute neutrophil
count of z1  109/l and platelet count of z100  109/l), and
a normal bone marrow morphology with no evidence of
dysplasia and 5% or fewer blasts. a partial response was
defined as fulfilling the criteria for cr in the peripheral blood
but with 6% to 25% abnormal cells in the marrow or z50%
decrease in bone marrow blasts compared with pretreatment
values. crp was defined as per cr but with a platelet count of
<100  109/l.
sample collection. whole blood samples were collected after
obtaining written informed consent. patient blood was
collected into an acid citrate dextrose tube (becton dickinson,
sparks, md) and shipped with cold packs to arrive at and be
processed at abbott within 24 hours of collection. samples for
b-tubulin gene, cec, and circulating epc analyses were
collected on day 1 (baseline) and day 21 of cycle 1, at the
time of second and third bone marrow aspirates and/or
biopsies, and at the end of treatment or off-study.
analysis of b-tubulin gene ( xxxg2352xxx ) mutations. blood was
then transferred to a cell preparation tube (becton dickinson)
for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. leukemic
cells were enriched from the peripheral blood mononuclear
cell fraction by positive immunoselection (miltenyi biotec,
auburn, ca) with a cocktail of antibodies defined by the
patient’s bone marrow flow cytometry report. once an
antibody cocktail was assigned to a patient, all subsequent
samples from that patient were enriched similarly. three
different antibody cocktails were used: (a)  xxxg163xxx  +  xxxg382xxx  +
cd34; (b)  xxxg1417xxx  +  xxxg375xxx  + cd34; and (c)  xxxg163xxx  +  xxxg382xxx  (bd
pharmingen, san diego, ca). enriched cancer cells were
washed and centrifuged. the resulting negative fraction from
this enrichment/immunoselection procedure was used as the
control. cell pellets were stored at 80jc until dna extraction.
genomic dna was isolated from sorted peripheral wbc
using the gentra puregene system according to manufacturer’s instructions (gentra systems, minneapolis, mn). the
primer sets used to amplify exons 1 and 4 from the most
common isoform of the b-tubulin gene family,  xxxg2352xxx  (class i
h-tubulin subtype  xxxg2352xxx ; h5), and their resulting fragment sizes
are listed in table 1. exons 1 and 4 were evaluated as the
colchicines-binding site on h-tubulin and have been localized
to the nh2 terminus domain (amino acids 1-36 corresponding
to exon 1 and part of exon 2) and the cooh terminus domain
(residues 214-241 corresponding to exon 4; refs. 45 – 48). the
exon 1 pcr primer sets were designed to amplify all of exon 1,

www.aacrjournals.org

whereas the exon 4 primer sets were used to amplify the
majority of the exon 4 coding region, 102 bp in the middle of
the exon. pcr was done using the platinum taq dna
polymerase hi fi kit (invitrogen life technologies, carlsbad,
ca) under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer’s
protocol. the reactions contained 0.03 unit/al of platinum taq
dna polymerase hi fi, 1 platinum taq hi fi pcr buffer,
2 mmol/l  xxxd2534xxx , 0.2 mmol/l deoxynucleotide triphosphates
(roche, indianapolis, in), and 300 nmol/l of each primer
(integrated dna technologies, inc., coralville, ia). briefly,
50 ng of genomic dna were amplified in 50 al reaction
volumes in a geneamp pcr system 9700 (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca). for each pcr primer set, the following cycling
conditions were used: one cycle of 94jc for 90 seconds;
55 cycles of 94jc for 30 seconds, 55jc for 30 seconds, and
72jc for 30 seconds; and one final elongation cycle of 72jc for
3 minutes. each pcr fragment was amplified in a separate pcr
reaction.
the pcr products amplified from  xxxg2352xxx  exons 1 and 4 were
subjected to dideoxy sequencing using the primer sets listed in
table 1. both dna strands of each amplified fragment were
sequenced on the applied biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer
using the bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(applied biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
briefly, 2 ag of each pcr fragment were sequenced in a 20-al
reaction with 4 al bigdye terminator ready reaction mix, 4 al
cycle sequencing buffer, and 1.6 amol/l primer. the reactions
were amplified on a geneamp pcr system 9700 (applied
biosystems) using the following protocol: 25 cycles of 94jc for
10 seconds, 50jc for 5 seconds, and 60jc for 4 minutes.
sequencing fragments were purified using sephacryl s-300
high resolution (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj)
columns before analyzing on the 3130 genetic analyzer.
circulating endothelial cell and circulating endothelial precursor/progenitor cell analyses. whole blood was incubated with a
panel of fluorescent monoclonal antibodies, reacting with the
endothelial markers p1h12-fitc (cd146; calbiochem, san
diego, ca) and  xxxg1724xxx -pe (bd biosciences, san jose, ca), and
cd45-apc (bd biosciences; to exclude hematopoietic cells),
along with a nuclear stain (lds -751; molecular probes,
eugene, or). by switching the  xxxg1724xxx -pe antibody to either
cd133-pe (miltenyi biotec) or  xxxg166xxx -pe (bd biosciences),
characterization of epcs and apoptotic endothelial cells
were done, respectively. stained whole blood then underwent
red cell lysis and fixation using facslyse (dako, carpinteria,
ca) and was read using four-color flow cytometry on either
a bd lsr-ii (bd biosciences) or a bd facscalibur (bd
biosciences). a panel of isotype control antibodies (bd
biosciences) was used to establish the appropriate negative
controls. at least 50,000 events were acquired in duplicate for
each measurement.3
cecs were defined as being nucleated (lds-751 positive),
positive for cd146 and  xxxg1724xxx , and negative or dimly positive
for cd45. epcs were defined as coexpressing cd133 and
cd146, being cd45 dim or negative and nucleated.3 all
phenotypic analyses were reported as a percentage of total cecs
measured in that run.

considered significant. associations between variables were
evaluated by pearson’s correlation coefficient r.

results
study group. a total of 32 patients were entered into the
study between january 2003 and june 2004. patient characteristics are listed in table 2. twenty-nine patients (91%) had a
diagnosis of aml or mds, most of whom had poor-risk
cytogenetics (83%) and/or had a previous history of solid
tumor or other hematologic disorder requiring chemotherapy
or immunotherapy (55%). one patient with a t(8;21) had
additional clonal abnormalities, including trisomy 6 and
+der(21)t(8;21). patients were heavily pretreated with 87%
having received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens
and 19% having received an allogeneic stem cell transplant. a
77-year-old man had not received any prior therapy for aml
but had received treatment with a farnesyltransferase protein
inhibitor for mds.
dose escalation. a total of 46 cycles of therapy were given on
either a 7 of 21-day or 21 of 28-day regimen, with a median of
one cycle (range, 0-8 cycles). the first nine patients were treated
on a 7 of 21-day schedule. the first cohort received 100 mg/m2/
dose, the second 125 mg/m2/dose, and the third 150 mg/m2/
dose. no dlts were observed in the initial three patient cohorts
(table 3). patients received a median of two cycles of therapy
(range, 1-8) on the 7 of 21-day schedule.
after the first three cohorts were accrued, the treatment
schema was modified to an initial dose level of 75 mg/m2 daily
orally for 21 days every 4 weeks. no dlts were observed in the
initial five cohorts of patients. one of four patients experienced
small bowel obstruction/ileus as a dlt at the 200 mg/m2 dose
level. the next patient enrolled at this dose level experienced
grade 2 constipation with absent bowel sounds not responsive
to laxatives, but which resolved with the discontinuation
of abt-751. further expansion at this dose level was not

attempted because of concern that ileus/small bowel obstruction could recur. patients received a median of one cycle of
therapy (range, 0-2) on the 21 of 28-day schedule.
medication and protocol adherence. patient adherence to
medication was excellent with only five patients missing one or
two doses of abt-751. one patient on the 7 of 21-day regimen
required a transient dose interruption with subsequent reduction
from 100 to 75 mg/m2/dose for grade 1 confusion, dizziness,
and somnolence, which were subsequently determined to have
been caused by leukemia-related leptomeningeal involvement.
another patient on the 7 of 21-day regimen, who required a
transient dose interruption while undergoing a splenectomy for
symptomatic splenomegaly, had a subsequent dose escalation
from 100 to 125 mg/m2/dose for the third cycle of therapy. six
patients received concomitant therapy with hydroxyurea for
leukocytosis, all of whom were subsequently taken off study for
disease progression. one patient received intrathecal instillations of chemotherapy for leptomeningeal disease and was also
later taken off study for disease progression.
side effects. all 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity. the
nonhematologic toxicities for nine patients treated with the 7 of
21-day dosing regimen are summarized in table 3. the most
common grade 1 or 2 adverse effects were nausea and/or
vomiting (33%), diarrhea (33%), constipation (33%), increased
alkaline phosphatase and/or bilirubin (33%), peripheral paresthesias (22%), somnolence (22%), and anorexia (22%). one
patient receiving abt-751 at a dose of 150 mg/m2 developed
grade 1 hyperbilirubinemia during the fifth cycle of therapy. this
progressed to grade 3 (peak total bilirubin, 3.2 mg/d) on cycle
8 with the concomitant development of nonneutropenic sepsis,
pneumonia, and worsening ischemic cardiomyopathy.
grade 1 or 2 adverse events were documented at all dose
levels for patients receiving the 21 of 28-day regimen (table 4).
no consistent or significant increment in the frequency of grade
2 toxicities was observed as the dose of abt-751 was escalated.
the most frequent toxicities were gastrointestinal [i.e., nausea
and/or vomiting (56%), constipation (43%), diarrhea (39%),
anorexia (26%), abdominal pain (13%), mucositis (13%),
and elevations of transaminases, bilirubin, and/or alkaline

phosphatase (13%)]. neurologic symptoms included peripheral neuropathy (17%), dizziness (4%), and somnolence
(4%). fatigue was observed in 17% of patients, bone pain
in 13%, and weight loss in 13%. one patient experienced a
grade 3 ileus/small bowel obstruction during the first cycle of
treatment at the 200 mg/m2/dose, which resolved with
conservative management and discontinuation of abt-751.
the subsequent patient enrolled at this dose experienced grade
2 constipation unresponsive to laxatives, abdominal pain, and
nausea and vomiting. abt-751 was held and the patient
continued treatment with laxatives, with resolution of these
symptoms. the patient subsequently withdrew from the study.
further expansion at this dose level was not attempted
because of the concern of recurrent ileus/small bowel
obstruction. therefore, the recommended phase 2 dose for
hematologic malignancies is 175 mg/m2 daily orally for 21
days every 4 weeks.

twenty-four infectious episodes were noted in 19 patients
(59%). these included fever of unknown origin in four patients
(12%) and documented infections in 15 patients (47%): five
episodes of bacteremia, eight pneumonias, two cellulitis, one
perirectal abscess, one pseudomembranous colitis, and three
urinary tract infections. three patients with aml died while on
study from neutropenic sepsis.
response to treatment. twenty-nine patients were evaluable
for response. two patients withdrew from study without
completing one cycle of therapy; a third was taken off study
after developing a dlt before completion of at least one cycle
of treatment.
one patient with relapsed aml achieved a crp after two
cycles of therapy on the 7 of 21-day regimen at a dose of 150
mg/m2/dose that was sustained for 2 months, at which time a
repeat bone marrow assessment revealed the recurrence of
dysplastic features consisting of dyerythropoiesis and 5% blasts.
further treatment with abt-751 was discontinued after the
eighth cycle of therapy because of nonneutropenic sepsis with
pneumonia, worsening ischemic cardiomyopathy with pulmonary edema, and grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia. four patients had
hematologic improvement. two patients, with diagnoses of
aml and all, treated with abt-751 at a dose of 175 mg/m2/
dose for 21 days every 28 days had a reduction in the percentage
of peripheral blood blasts from 43% to 5% and from 94% to
0%, respectively. in the first patient, the blasts increased to 33%
with the discontinuation of abt-751 during the 7-day drug-free
period but disappeared completely on reinitiation of the drug.
this patient subsequently decided to withdraw from further
therapy. the second patient was taken off-study because of
disease progression in the bone marrow. one patient with aml
receiving the 125 mg/m2/dose showed a transient elevation in
the platelet count from 23  109/l to 75  109/l. another
patient with aml treated with a dose of 150 mg/m2/dose had an
elevation in the platelet count from 32  109/l to 81  109/l.

patients (82 cell fractions from 20 patients with aml, three
with all, and one with mds) and sequenced for variants in
exons 1 and 4. one patient had genomic dna isolated only
during therapy and not at baseline.
two single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) were discovered in the  xxxg2352xxx  promoter region (i.e., g ! a and c ! t at
nucleotides 49 and 38, respectively, in 75% and 79% of
patients, respectively; data not shown). six snps were detected
in genomic dna in exon 4 (i.e., 567 c ! t, 616 g ! a, 627
t ! g, 665 c ! g, 627 t ! c, and 806 c ! t in 4%, 12.5%,
75%, 46%, 12.5%, and 12.5% of patients, respectively; data not
shown). three of these snps encoded for nonsynonymous
amino acid changes. of these three nonsynonymous snps, two
have been previously reported (665 c ! g for ser201cys and
806 c ! t for ala248val; ref. 49). the ala248val change seems

close to the colchicines-binding site (amino acids 214-241; refs.
45, 46). the third novel nonsynonymous snp, 616 g ! a
(ala185thr), was detected in the control fraction and leukemia
samples of three patients with aml not responding to therapy.
loss of heterozygosity was detected at baseline in two patients
with aml, involving both snps in the promoter region in one
patient and nucleotide 627 in exon 4 in one patient. no
changes in the  xxxg2352xxx  gene sequence were detected during the
course of therapy. there was no discernible association between
individual polymorphisms and response to treatment.
circulating endothelial cell and circulating endothelial precursor/progenitor cell enumeration. phenotypic analyses of cecs,
epcs, and apoptotic endothelial cells were done on patients
with a wbc count of >1  109/l. twenty-four of 26 patients
had blood analyzed for cecs. these patients with refractory
leukemia and advanced mds (20 patients with aml, three with
all, and one with mds) exhibited wide ranges in cec and
phenotypic numbers compared with normal subjects (table 5;
fig. 2). the baseline mean cec concentrations and the
percentage of epcs were significantly different from normal
controls (p = 0.037 and p < 0.0001, respectively). similarly, the
proportion of apoptotic cecs was significantly decreased in
patients with hematologic malignancies compared with healthy
controls (p < 0.0001).
there was no difference in the cec levels and proportion
of epcs or apoptotic cecs observed in patients with aml, all,
or mds, albeit the small number of patients with diagnoses of
all or mds. there were no differences observed with age
(>60 versus <60 years) or de novo versus secondary or therapyrelated aml.
a strong correlation was observed between changes in the
cec levels and wbc counts during treatment (r = 0.89; fig. 3);
there was no correlation with epcs. decreases in cecs were
not detected until patients were dosed at z175 mg/m2, with
four of five patients showing decreased cec levels and the fifth
stable levels. there were no differences in the proportion of
epcs and apoptotic cecs in patients receiving abt-751 at doses
z175 mg/m2 compared with those receiving lower doses. two
patients with leukemia who received abt-751 at a dose of
175 mg/m2/d had decreases in cecs from 230.9/al and 18.8/al,
respectively, on day 1, to 6.1/al and 3.6/al, respectively, on day
21. these changes correlated with a reduction in absolute
peripheral blasts from 9.87  109/l and 5.5  109/l,
respectively, to 0  109/l and 0.17  109/l, respectively.

abt-751 in refractory hematologic malignancies

200 mg/m2/d showed a decrease in cec concentration from
32.8/al to 1.8/al, correlating with a reduction in peripheral
blasts from 1.54  109/l to 0.75  109/l.
baseline evaluation for the subject who experienced a crp
while receiving abt-751 at doses of 150 mg/m2 was not done;
however, all subsequent analyses showed low concentrations of
cecs ranging from 0.1/al to 1.7/al, with a value of 1.3/al at
study completion. the cec levels did not decrease in the two
patients with hematologic improvements in platelet counts,
both of whom received doses of <175 mg/m2.

discussion
abt-751 exposure results in inhibition of microtubule
assembly with resultant g2-m arrest and apoptosis. abt-751
is a candidate novel drug for development, as approved
antineoplastic agents do not target the  xxxd1740xxx -binding
domain of tubulin. it has a broad spectrum of antitumor
activity that is not affected by p-glycoprotein overexpression
and has good absorption after oral administration. (11, 12, 42).
the current study indicates that the recommended phase 2
dose for patients with hematologic malignancies is 175 mg/m2
daily orally for 21 days every 28 days. none of the three
patients treated at this dose experienced any grade 3 or 4

toxicities. although only one of the patients treated with 200
mg/m2 daily (i.e., 450 mg/d) orally for 21 days every 28 days
developed a dlt consisting of ileus/small bowel obstruction, a
subsequent patient (also receiving an actual dose of 450 mg/d)
developed grade 2 constipation. therefore, further expansion at
this dose was not pursued, as this level of toxicity was felt to be
dose limiting.
this recommended phase 2 dose is higher than the
maximum tolerated dose (i.e., 200 or f100 mg/m2) reported
for abt-751 given in patients with advanced solid tumors in
phase 1 dose-escalating trials using this schedule (43). the
patients in the 175 mg/m2/dose cohort received actual doses of
either 350 mg/d (n = 1) or 375 mg/d (n = 2). eighteen of 23
patients (78%) in the current study treated with abt-751 on the
21 of 28-day schedule received abt-751 at doses of z200 mg/d
up to a maximum of 450 mg/d; only four of them received a
dose of 200 mg/d. most patients completed at least one cycle of
therapy, except for one patient each receiving 200, 225, 325,
and 300 mg/d, and two patients receiving 450 mg/d. dlt was
observed only in one patient receiving a dose of 450 mg/d. the
dlts reported in patients with solid tumors treated with abt751 were ileus, small bowel obstruction, and peripheral
neuropathy (42, 43). the majority had colon cancer (n = 25
of 69, 36%), some with prior abdominal surgery and prior

oxaliplatin therapy. in the current study, only three patients
(9%) with all had received prior vincristine therapy, two of
whom had grade 1 or 2 peripheral paresthesias at baseline
without any worsening of these symptoms on study. eleven
patients (34%) had prior intra-abdominal surgery, including
the patient who developed the ileus.
antileukemic activity of abt-751 was observed in five patients,
four of whom had been heavily pretreated, with one patient
achieving a crp. the effect was modest and transient in the four
other patients, consisting of a decrease in peripheral blood blasts
and elevations in platelet counts. although abt-751 pharmacokinetics were not determined in this study, the daily doses given
to these patients were within the range of those given to patients
with solid tumors in ongoing phase 1 studies (11, 12, 42). in
patients with solid tumors, abt-751 accumulation measured by
trough plasma concentrations was minimal after doses once
(25-300 mg) or twice (25-175 mg) daily during multiple dosing
for 7 or 21 days. although abt-751 plasma concentrations at
steady state were about z0.5 ag/ml at dose levels similar to those
in the current study. based on the pharmacokinetics of abt-751
in patients with solid tumors, it was expected that efficacious
concentrations in preclinical models (0.5-1.5 g/ml) would be
achieved in all patients in this study.
the modest activity of single-agent abt-751 in this group of
patients may be due to acquired or inherent resistance
mediated in part by mutations in genes encoding the h-tubulin
subunits that impair binding of drugs (47, 48). therefore, we
investigated whether mutations occurred in the colchicinesbinding site of h-tubulin. like other investigators (49, 50), we
did not detect the h-tubulin mutations previously described by
monzó et al. in patients with paclitaxel resistant non – small cell
lung cancer (48). this discrepancy may be due to amplification
of homologous nonfunctional h-tubulin pseudogenes by
monzó et al. (49 – 51). we did however detect several polymorphisms. two of the nonsynonymous snps in exon 4,

clin cancer res 2005;11(18) september 15, 2005

detected in this study, have been described previously (52).
however, a novel snp on exon 4, resulting in the ala185thr
polymorphism, lying outside of the stated  xxxd1740xxx -binding
sites (45, 46), was observed. the significance of the h-tubulin
polymorphisms is currently unknown. further evaluation of
the ala185thr polymorphism, along with the two promoter
snps (49g>a and 38c>t), and complete sequencing of the
h-tubulin gene ( xxxg2352xxx ), in particular exon 2 that contains
sequences important for  xxxd1740xxx  binding, are under way.
increased cecs and circulating epcs have been described
previously in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. this is
the first study to evaluate cecs and epcs in patients with acute
leukemias and advanced mds. this patient population has
increased angiogenesis, as shown by elevated microvessel
density or  xxxg2413xxx  levels, which
may correlate with prognosis. correlation between vascular
endothelial growth factor levels and cecs have been shown
(32, 33). a correlation between cecs and wbc counts existed at
baseline, and changes in wbc on therapy were generally
reflected in changes in cec levels (fig. 3). significantly higher
and more variable cec and circulating epcs concentrations and
lower proportions of apoptotic cecs were observed in patients
with relapsed or refractory leukemia or advanced mds
compared with healthy normal subjects (table 5; fig. 2). in
addition, patients with reductions in peripheral blood blasts
had reductions in wbc counts and cec levels. these results
suggest a close relationship between cec levels and bone
marrow activity in patients with leukemia. therefore, cecs,
both in number and phenotype, may play a role as a leukemic
biomarker. measurements of cecs may provide information on
the activity of specific cancer drugs (e.g., increased apoptosis of
cecs being observed in effective antiangiogenic treatments).
there was no increase in the proportion of apoptotic cecs,
although only a small number of patients were treated at doses
z175 mg/m2. this may indicate that the mechanism of action of
abt-751 is not mediated by antiangiogenesis (53). an
important issue for future studies to examine is the dynamics
of the relationship between changes in cec and clinical
responses, the currently reported study was not large enough
to address this issue.
one patient with relapsed aml-m2 was noted to have an
extremely high number of cecs at baseline (i.e., 599.7/al, of
which 93.8% were epcs). this patient had received a prior
matched related donor stem cell transplant, while in relapse,
achieved a crp of short duration and developed chronic
graft-versus-host disease. she commenced abt-751 therapy
5 months after transplantation and at the time and was taken
off study for disease progression after completing 21 days of
therapy. the wbc count had increased from 19.5  109/l to
53.1  109/l and cecs to 846.4/al (of which 96% were epcs).
the percentage of peripheral and bone marrow blasts increased
from 81% to 91% and from 45% to 88%, respectively. this
differs significantly from mean baseline cec, epc, and
apoptotic cec levels of 2.4/al f 0.9/al (median, 1.9/al),
25.6 f 10.0% (median, 16.4%), and 36.4 f 9.9% (median,
30.7%), respectively, in five other patients with aml who had
received a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant
after a similar  xxxd2120xxx -based conditioning regimen. median
interval between allogeneic stem cell transplant and therapy
with abt-751 was 4.3 months (range, 2.7-18). median number
of cycles completed was 1 (range, 0-1). no patient achieved a

abt-751 in refractory hematologic malignancies

cr nor had hematologic improvements. no patient had active
graft-versus-host disease while receiving therapy with abt-751;
graft-versus-host disease has been documented to increase cec
levels (54).
thus, the high variability in cecs observed in patients may
be to due to the presence of comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular
disease; ref. 55), medications (e.g., statins and cyclosporin; refs.
56 – 58), prior therapy (e.g., stem cell transplant; refs. 59, 60),

or sepsis (61). therefore, individual medical history is critical
when cecs are evaluated in a given patient.
abt-751 is a well-tolerated oral microtubule inhibitor with
some evidence of clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients
with acute leukemia. the recommended phase 2 dose is 175
mg/m2 daily orally for 21 days every 28 days in this patient
population. further investigation of this agent in this population is warranted.
