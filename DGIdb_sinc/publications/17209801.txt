abstract
amphetamine is a psychostimulant commonly used to treat several disorders, including attention deﬁcit, narcolepsy, and obesity. plasmalemmal and vesicular monoamine transporters, such as
the neuronal  xxxg2149xxx  and the vesicular monoamine
transporter-2, are two of its principal targets. this review focuses on
new insights, obtained from both in vivo and in vitro studies, into the
molecular mechanisms whereby amphetamine, and the closely related compounds methamphetamine and  xxxd2611xxx , cause monoamine, and particularly dopamine, release.
these mechanisms include amphetamine-induced exchange diffusion, reverse transport, and channel-like transport phenomena as
well as the weak base properties of amphetamine. additionally,
amphetamine analogs may affect monoamine transporters through
phosphorylation, transporter trafﬁcking, and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. all of these mechanisms have potential implications for both amphetamine- and methamphetamineinduced neurotoxicity, as well as dopaminergic neurodegenerative
diseases.

 xxxd2611xxx 

overview
amphetamine (1-methyl- xxxd2901xxx , amph)∗ is a psychostimulant commonly used to treat several disorders, including attention deﬁcit, narcolepsy, and
obesity. it is one member of a collection of compounds referred to herein as
amphetamines, many of which are comprised of a phenyl ring connected to an
amino group by a two-carbon side chain with a methyl group on carbon-1 of the
side chain (figure 1). methamphetamine (meth) and  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) are other members of this group. meth is widely abused for
its ability to increase wakefulness and physical activity and decrease appetite. mdma
is an illicit stimulant/hallucinogen used, at least initially, to attain mental stimulation,
emotional warmth, enhanced sensory perception, and increased physical energy. this
review focuses on these agents, with a particular emphasis on recent studies providing
new insights into their mechanism(s) of action.

and several of its analogs were tested in animal models [1; for an excellent review
of the chemistry and metabolism of amph and its analogs, see nichols (2) and
cho & kumagai (3), respectively]. years passed before gordon alles, in an effort

to develop potent decongestants, independently synthesized the compound. he and
his colleagues were among the ﬁrst to report its stimulant effects (1; for an excellent
review of the history of amph and its analogs, see also reference 4).
several more years passed before mechanisms underlying the action of amph
began to be elucidated fully. by the late 1950s, researchers suggested that amph
acts peripherally to release a “noradrenaline-like substance” (5). years later, several studies demonstrated that amph released central catecholamines as well. since
then, numerous studies have focused on the impact of amph and its analogs on
plasmalemmal transporters, including the dopamine (da) transporter (dat), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5ht) transporter, and  xxxg2148xxx , as
reviewed below. although amph and its analogs generally display comparable actions at the various transporters, the dat is the protein most frequently implicated
in their reinforcing properties and abuse potential. thus, unless otherwise indicated,
discussion of the impact of amph on plasmalemmal transporters will focus on
the dat. the reader is directed to several excellent recent reviews for additional
discussion (4, 6–9).

exchange diffusion, reverse transport,
and channel-like transport
several lines of evidence indicate that plasmalemmal transporters are the conduits
through which amph causes monoamine release. early evidence included ﬁndings
by raiteri et al. (10), who reported that amph releases da by a mechanism that can be
prevented by the da reuptake inhibitor,  xxxd2746xxx . concurrently, fischer & cho
(11) suggested an exchange diffusion model wherein extracellular amph substitutes
or exchanges for da and is transported into cells by the dat. this increases the
probability that cytosolic da will bind to the dat and be transported out down
its concentration gradient. thus, in this model, the da-releasing effects of amph
are caused by its ability to be transported by the dat. later, liang & rutledge (12)
proposed a concentration-dependent dual mechanism of da release. in particular, and
when present at low concentrations, extracellular amph is exchanged for cytosolic
da via the dat. however, at higher concentrations, amph, a highly lipophilic
compound (13), diffuses into nerve terminals through the plasmalemmal membrane
and liberates da from intraneuronal binding sites allowing it to exit the terminal via
dat-mediated reverse transport.
for an exchange diffusion/reverse transport model to be correct, amph must be
a substrate for dat. the best evidence for amph as a transporter substrate came
from zaczek et al. (14), who demonstrated that amph accumulation was saturable,
temperature-dependent, and ouabain-sensitive in striatal synaptosomes. these data
also indicate active transport of the ligand. this accumulation was prevented by
coincubation with the dat reuptake inhibitors methylphenidate (mpd) and cocaine.
further important evidence that amph analogs are substrates for dat came from
electrophysiological studies involving xenopus oocytes expressing the dat (hdat).
speciﬁcally, sonders et al. (15) demonstrated that both meth and amph elicit dalike transporter-associated currents. likewise, sitte et al. reported, “like the natural

substrate da, [amph is] transported and induces inward currents in dat-expressing
mammalian cells” (16).
recent ﬁndings by galli and coworkers (17) conﬁrmed and extended the studies.
speciﬁcally, these researchers reported that amph causes da efﬂux from neuronal
cultures and heterologous cells stably expressing hdat via two mechanisms. one involves a rapid, channel-like dat conﬁguration permitting millisecond bursts of da.
a second consists of a slower, exchange-like mechanism. noteworthy, these authors
estimate that while the channel-like mode is responsible for one tenth of amphinduced da release, this release resembles vesicular release in both magnitude and
timing and may therefore be involved in the psychostimulant effects of amphetamines
(for discussion, see 17).
still other evidence that amph is a substrate analog for the plasmalemmal dat
comes from ﬁndings that amph inhibits activity of the striatal dat by competing
with da for a common binding site.  xxxd2546xxx  competitively inhibits striatal dat
at this substrate-binding site. this stands in contrast to cocaine that inhibits striatal
dat at a site separate from, but interacting with, that of substrate analogs (18). thus,
an overwhelming amount of data demonstrate that amph is a substrate for dat, a
feature predictably due to its similar chemical structure to da (figure 1).

phosphorylation, reactive species formation, and internalization
in 1997, our laboratory (19) demonstrated that a single in vivo injection of the amph
analog, meth, rapidly (within 1 h) and reversibly decreased plasmalemmal da
uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from the striata of treated rats;
an effect attributable to a decreased vmax of uptake. this effect was not due to residual
meth that was introduced by its in vivo original administration. furthermore,
it was not associated with a decrease in binding of the dat ligand, win 35428
(20). this decrease in uptake concurrent with a lack of effect on binding of this
presumably membrane-permeable ligand was consistent with the possibility of dat
internalization; a phenomenon since characterized extensively in vitro (see discussion
below). transport of 5ht, but not norepinephrine, was affected similarly by meth
treatment (21, 22). noteworthy and similar to the ex vivo effect, incubation of striatal
synaptosomes with meth rapidly decreased dat activity, but not win 35428
binding. dat phosphorylation likely contributed to this in vitro meth-induced
deﬁcit, as it was prevented by coincubation with a protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor
(23).
phosphorylation. a role for pkc in the effects of amph analogs on dat as assessed ex vivo was predictable, as amph application in vitro had been reported to
increase striatal particulate pkc activity (24), and several investigators had reported
downregulation of dat function in vitro in response to pkc activation (25–31). the
impact of pkc activation on dat is, however, complex and involves not only uptake
but release as well. in particular, application of a pkc activator can induce da efﬂux
(32, 33), and amph-induced da efﬂux can be prevented by application of pkc
inhibitors (32, 34). an association between da release and dat phosphorylation

is further suggested by ﬁndings that mutation of the dat n-terminus suppresses
amph-induced da efﬂux (35). of relevance are ﬁndings that phosphorylation of
the n-terminus of the dat shifts it “from a reluctant state to a willing state for
amph-induced da efﬂux, without affecting inward transport” (35).
adding to the complexity are ﬁndings of giambalvo (36) that amph and da may
have dual effects on pkc activity. during efﬂux of exogenous da, pkc activity is
stimulated. conversely, the inward transport of amph inhibits pkc activity. the
stimulatory effect of amph application in vitro requires both intracellular calcium
and endogenous da (24, 36). in a subsequent study, she reported that phospholipases
c and a(2) are involved in the amph-induced changes in pkc activity (24).
elegant studies by vaughan and coworkers (37) directly addressed whether treatment with amph analogs in vivo altered dat phosphorylation. in particular, they
found that a single administration of meth to rats increased dat phosphorylation. this was demonstrated ex vivo in rats sacriﬁced 30 min after treatment by
measuring 32 po4 labeling of striatal dat. meth application in vitro to rat dat
(rdat) llc-pk(1) cells or striatal tissue also increased 32 po4 metabolic labeling.
both the meth-induced phosphorylation and a concurrent downregulation of da
transport in vitro were prevented by coapplication of a pkc inhibitor, a transport
ﬁnding similar to that reported previously (23). importantly, meth-induced phosphorylation of dat was not observed in an n-terminally truncated protein lacking
the ﬁrst 21 residues, including six serines (i.e., a site of phosphorylation by phorbol
esters), while the decrease in dat activity was still present. taken together, these
data suggest meth can alter dat function via phosphorylation-dependent and
phosphorylation-independent mechanisms (37).
reactive species formation. one mechanism whereby meth can decrease dat
function, presumably independent of transporter phosphorylation, involves reactive
species formation. exposure to either reactive oxygen or nitrogen species can alter
dat function (e.g., 38–40). further, meth exposure can promote formation of
these reactive species (for review, see 41–44). among the ﬁrst demonstrations of this
was work by cubells et al. (45), who applied meth to postnatal ventral midbrain da
neuron cultures and provided data suggesting that meth treatment rapidly alters
vesicular da sequestration that can, in turn, promote aberrant accumulation of intraneuronal da and subsequently reactive species formation. the interplay between
the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx -2 ( xxxg2099xxx -2, a protein primarily responsible for
vesicular da sequestration) and dat function is discussed further below.
internalization. among the reasons that amph analog-induced dat phosphorylation has received considerable attention is speculation that it may contribute
to internalization of the transporter. several studies in vitro have implicated that
phosphorylation is key to internalization. for example, in 1997, zhu et al. (46) reported that application of a pkc activator decreased da uptake in oocytes expressing
the cloned hdat and decreased the binding of the dat ligand,  xxxd2546xxx , in intact
oocytes. this treatment did not alter total binding of  xxxd2546xxx , suggesting that phosphorylation contributes to internalization of the dat. similarly, pristupa et al. (31)

utilized confocal microscopy to demonstrate that pkc activation rapidly internalized the hdat from the plasmalemmal membrane, whereas pkc/pka inhibition
led to recruitment of these transporters to the cell surface. subsequent and important
studies conﬁrmed and extended ﬁndings that pkc activation can decrease surface
dat expression in vitro (47). this decrease in surface expression appears to be due
to an increase in dat endocytosis coupled with a reduction in recycling back to the
plasmalemmal membrane (48). importantly, not all internalization is entirely pkcmediated, as distinct mechanisms underlying constitutive transporter internalization
have been described (49).
in 2000, galli and coworkers (50) utilized both confocal microscopy and electophysiological techniques to demonstrate that application of amph caused dat
internalization, as assessed in hek-293 cells stably expressing the hdat. the loss
of cell surface dat was observed using confocal microscopy as early as 20 min after amph treatment and was maximal after 1 h, a time frame consistent with the
decrease in dat activity observed 1 h after meth treatment by our laboratory
(see above) that presumably reﬂected, at least in part, dat internalization. sorkina
et al. (51) extended these ﬁndings by demonstrating in vitro that amph application
induced an intracellular hdat accumulation in endosomes. using ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer technology (fret) involving stably transfected cells, these
investigators provided evidence that once internalized, the dat formed oligomers.
the formation of oligomers in vivo after amph analog treatment is discussed below.
although considerable attention has focused on internalization and effects beginning at least several minutes after treatment, gnegy and coworkers (52) utilized
biotinylation of rat striatal synaptosomes to label surface dat and thereby study
dat redistribution at very early time points. these investigators found that amph
application rapidly (within 30 s), but brieﬂy (lasting less than 2.5 min), increased
synaptosomal dat surface expression, an increase prevented by cocaine pretreatment and associated with increased delivery of dat to the plasmalemmal membrane.
da application per se did not mimic this effect. amph application did not alter da
uptake, but it did increase basal and amph-induced da efﬂux.

additional complexities
the in vivo studies mentioned above describe the impact of a single administration of
an amph analog. particularly, a single meth injection causes a rapid and reversible
decrease in dat function that is not associated with a change in bmax of binding of
win 35428 (19, 20, 53). in contrast, many studies have focused on the acute impact
of repeated administrations of the stimulant. regimens such as these involving 3–5
injections administered at 2–6-h intervals were originally designed to mimic the
“runs” wherein abusers binged on these agents. like the effect of a single meth injection, multiple meth administrations rapidly decreased dat function as well, as
assessed in rat striatal synaptosomes prepared 1 h after the ﬁnal meth treatment, an
effect attributable to a reduced vmax and an unchanged km. (20). however, the magnitude of the effect was greater than that resulting from a single injection, allowing
for the possibility that the decrease resulting from repeated injections is comprised of

more than one phenomenon. noteworthy, a similar decrease has also been observed
in mice (54). this meth-induced decrease is not due to residual drug introduced
by the original subcutaneous injections nor to an acute loss of dat protein (20). in
contrast to the effects of a single meth injection, it is associated with a decrease in
win 35428 binding. also, in contrast with effects of a single meth treatment, this
effect is only partially reversed 24 h later (20).
a series of studies comparing mechanisms underlying the acute effects of single
and repeated meth administrations have provided insight into the differential regulation of the dat. da per se contributes to at least one component of the rapid
decrease in dat activity caused by repeated meth injections, as pretreatment with
alpha-methyl- xxxd3459xxx  (a  xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor that causes da depletion),
a d1 antagonist (sch23390), or a d2 antagonist (eticlopride) partially attenuated
this deﬁcit. in contrast, these treatments did not alter the response of dat to a single
meth injection. furthermore, prevention of meth-induced hyperthermia attenuated the deﬁcit caused by repeated stimulant treatments, but did not alter the effect
of a single meth administration. finally, pretreatment with the radical scavenger,
n-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone, partially inhibited the decrease caused by multiple,
but not a single, meth treatment (55). from these studies, it has been suggested
that the response to repeated meth injections is comprised of at least two distinct phenomena. the ﬁrst is a rapidly reversing acute transporter response (atr)
that resembles the effects of a single meth injection (i.e., is temperature- and daindependent, is not associated with a change in bmax , and recovers during the ﬁrst 24
h after treatment; atrind ). the second is a da-, temperature-, and reactive species–
sensitive acute transporter response (atrda ) that persists for at least 24 h after drug
treatment and is associated with a decrease in win 35428 binding (for review, see
56). whether these atrs occur independently or if the atrind is permissive for the
atrda remains to be elucidated.
in addition to the decrease in uptake described above, baucum et al. (57) reported
that multiple administrations of meth promoted formation of higher molecular
weight (>170 kda) dat-associated protein complexes, as assessed in synaptosomal
preparations 24–48 h after treatment. these ﬁndings were remarkable in that these
data are among the ﬁrst to demonstrate complex formation in vivo. prior to this
ﬁnding, radiation inactivation studies suggested that the dat can exist as an oligomer
(58). cysteine crosslinking studies further indicated the possibility of symmetrical
dimers (59), whereas mutational analysis indicated that a critical motif in the second
transmembrane domain region of the dat is important for dat oligomerization
(60). further and as noted above, fret studies have suggested that once internalized,
dats form oligomers (51).
as with deﬁcits in da uptake, both prevention of hyperthermia and pretreatment
with alpha-methyl- xxxd3459xxx  attenuated meth-induced dat complex formation
(57). in contrast, a single injection of meth or multiple injections of mdma (i.e.,
treatments that, unlike meth, cause little or no persistent da deﬁcits) caused minimal complex formation (57). sulfhydryl bridges likely contribute to complex formation because coincubation with the reducing agent,  xxxd26xxx , converts
some complexes from a greater than 170 kda to a 70 kda species. whether the dat

is binding to itself, other large proteins, or a combination of these possibilities has
yet to be determined.

amph and vesicular monoamine transporters

it has long been recognized that in addition to the dat, the  xxxg2099xxx -2 is a critical
mediator of amph-induced da release (for review, see (4)). a recent study involving
puriﬁed striatal vesicles demonstrated that meth-induced da efﬂux has an initial
velocity of 0.54 ± 0.08 fmol/s/mug protein and is blocked by application of the vmat2 inhibitor,  xxxd3330xxx  (61). another study has shown that adolescent rats have less
meth-induced vesicular da efﬂux than young adult rats, which may contribute to
their resistance to the effects of meth (62). mechanisms whereby amph and its
analogs alter vesicular da sequestration are described below.

the weak base hypothesis
it is widely accepted that the weak base properties of amph and its analogs contribute to its ability to disrupt vesicular storage within nerve terminals. amph is a
lipophilic weak base with a pka of 9.9 (64). as it is presumed that like chromafﬁn
granules, the interior of catecholaminergic vesicles is acidic [i.e., the ph of chromafﬁn granules is approximately 5.5 (4, 63)], intravesicular amph would accept protons
once sequestered within this environment. it is predicted that this alkalinizes vesicles: a phenomenon suggested by ﬁndings involving cultured midbrain neurons and
in isolated chromafﬁn granules (64). according to this weak base hypothesis, amph
enters the cell through transport and lipophilic diffusion and then diffuses through
the vesicular membrane and accumulates in vesicles. this disrupts the proton electrochemical gradient required for vesicular da sequestration and causes increased
cytoplasmic da accumulation. the elevated cytoplasmic da concentrations and altered concentration gradient reverse transport of da via the plasmalemmal dat (64,
65). in this model, elevated cytosolic da levels and disruption of vesicular sequestration cause da release via the dat, independent of the actions of amph on the dat.
unlike the plasmalemmal transporter exchange diffusion model described above, this
model does not require a mobile site that mediates transport across the membrane, a
suggestion supported by ﬁndings that weak bases that cause amph-like release, but
are not substrates for dat, induce reverse transport in da cell cultures (65, 66).
noteworthy, and in addition to its weak base properties, amph binds the vmat2 with relatively low (micromolar) afﬁnity (67). thus, by preventing vesicular da
uptake, amph may increase cytoplasmic da concentrations and also promote plasmalemmal da exchange.
although widely accepted, a few observations have yet to be explained by the
weak base hypothesis. among these are ﬁndings by floor & meng (68) that amph
(3 mum) depleted greater than 50% of radiolabeled da from isolated synaptic vesicles,
while only causing a 12% decrease in the proton gradient. a far better correlation
was observed when high concentrations (i.e., greater than 100 mum) of amph were
applied, although the physiological relevance of these concentrations is unclear.

redistribution of  xxxg2099xxx -2
in addition to disrupting the proton gradient and thereby da sequestration, accumulating evidence indicates yet another effect of amph analogs on  xxxg2099xxx -2 function.
in particular, brown et al. (69) ﬁrst demonstrated that repeated, high-dose administrations of meth to rats rapidly (within 1 h) decreased vesicular da uptake, as assessed
in vesicles puriﬁed from striata of treated rats. this largely involved dopaminergic
nerve terminals because destruction of the striatal serotonergic projections did not
alter vesicular da transport in this preparation. concurrently, sonsalla and coworkers (70) reported that meth treatment decreased both da uptake and binding of
the  xxxg2099xxx -2 ligand, dihydrotetrabenazine (dhtbz), as assessed in mice 24 h after
treatment in a puriﬁed vesicular preparation. however and importantly, no signiﬁcant loss of dhtbz binding was observed in whole striatal homogenates at this time
point. these data were the ﬁrst to highlight the “disparity between homogenates
and vesicle preparations” (70), and they provided an important clue suggesting
the possibility that  xxxg2099xxx -2 was redistributed within nerve terminals after meth
treatment.
consistent with a redistribution hypothesis, riddle et al. (71) reported that repeated, high-dose meth administrations rapidly (within 1 h) redistribute rat striatal
 xxxg2099xxx -2 immunoreactivity from synaptic vesicle-enriched, nonmembrane (presumably cytoplasmic) subcellular fractions to a location not retained in the preparation
of the synaptosomes. this decrease occurs concurrent with a meth-induced decrease in vesicular da content in the enriched vesicular fraction (72). subsequently,
yamamoto and coworkers (73) also demonstrated that meth decreased  xxxg2099xxx -2
immunoreactivity 1 and 24 h after treatment in a similar preparation.
the decrease in vesicular da uptake caused by meth appears common among
agents that cause da release. for instance, a single injection of amph rapidly
decreased vesicular da uptake in a similar fashion (e.l. riddle, unpublished observation). repeated administration of mdma likewise decreases striatal vesicular
dopamine transport, but unlike effects of multiple repeated meth injections, the
mdma-induced decrease partially recovers by 24 h after drug treatment (74).
the effects of da-releasing agents, such as amph and its analogs, are distinctly
different than effects of reuptake inhibitors, such as cocaine and methylphenidate
(mpd) (75–76). administration of these agents to rats rapidly (within 1 h) increases both da uptake and dhtbz binding, as assessed ex vivo in a vesicleenriched, nonmembrane-associated fraction. a similar phenomenon is observed in
mice (77). the cocaine- and mpd-induced increases in uptake correspond to a shift in
 xxxg2099xxx -2 protein from a plasmalemmal membrane-associated to a vesicle-enriched,
nonmembrane-associated fraction (71, 76).
d2 receptors contribute to the amph analog-induced alteration in  xxxg2099xxx -2
function. evidence for this includes ﬁndings that the decreases in vesicular da uptake caused by a single meth or multiple mdma injections are attenuated by
pretreatment with the d2 antagonist, eticlopride (74, 78). the role of d2 receptors in affecting vesicular da uptake and  xxxg2099xxx -2 redistribution is complex, as
d2 antagonist pretreatment also attenuates cocaine- and mpd-induced increases in

vesicular da uptake and/or  xxxg2099xxx -2 distribution into nonmembrane-associated
(presumably cytoplasmic) subcellular fractions (75, 76). similar to the effects of reuptake inhibitors, treatment with the dopamine d2 agonists increases vesicular da
uptake, dhtbz binding, and  xxxg2099xxx -2 immunoreactivity (75, 79–81). this paradox
underscores the complexity of mechanisms regulating  xxxg2099xxx -2 function.

dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2: co-contributors to da release?

by ali: academic libraries of indiana on 07/10/13. for personal use only.

while a role for dat in amph-induced da release has long been recognized, the
relative contribution of alterations in vesicular sequestration to this phenomenon has
been less clear. this is a consequence of disparate ﬁndings involving pretreatment with
the  xxxg2099xxx -2 inhibitor, reserpine. consonent with a role for vesicular da as contributing to amph-induced da release, some studies have demonstrated that reserpine
treatment attenuates this phenomenon (82, 83). other studies have found relatively
little or no effect of the pretreatment (84–86). interpretation of these studies may have
been confounded by ﬁndings that reserpine can inhibit plasmalemmal da uptake
(87).
using mice lacking the dat, jones et al. (88) reported that both depletion of
da from vesicles and reversal of dat are necessary for da release. vesicular da
depletion is the rate-limiting step in this process. moreover, the plasmalemmal dat
is not necessary for vesicular da depletion by amph. finally, increases in intracellular da per se may not be sufﬁcient to reverse the transport unless amph is
present, as evidenced by ﬁndings that application of a  xxxg2099xxx -2 inhibitor did not
increase wild-type striatal slice da overﬂow unless amph was also applied to the
preparation.
one important study indicating a role for both a plasmalemmal and a vesicular
component to the da-releasing action of amph was conducted by piﬂ and colleagues
(89) and involved cos-7 cells transfected with either the cdna of the dat,  xxxg2099xxx ,
or both. application of amph rapidly increased da release in cells expressing the
dat or expressing both the dat and  xxxg2099xxx . upon prolonged amph exposure, da
efﬂux from the dat-transfected cells returned to baseline, whereas in cells containing
both the dat and  xxxg2099xxx , da efﬂux was sustained.

amphetamines, transporters,
and neurotoxicity
repeated high-dose administrations of the amph analog, meth, cause persistent
dopaminergic deﬁcits (i.e., reductions in striatal da content, dat density, and/or
activity of the da synthesizing enzyme  xxxg2276xxx ) in rodents (90, 91),
nonhuman primates (92), and/or humans (93–94). we and others have hypothesized
that da per se contributes to this persistent deﬁcit. in particular and as described
above, meth disrupts vesicular da storage and induces a redistribution of  xxxg2099xxx -2
protein, resulting in aberrant cytosolic da accumulation. this, in turn, promotes formation of da-associated reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing to persistent
deﬁcits. the dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2 likely contribute to this phenomenon because these

proteins are principal regulators of da distribution and storage. accordingly, the role
of these transporters in effecting meth-induced deﬁcits has received considerable
attention (for reviews, see 41, 56, 95).
data indicating a role for the dat in the deﬁcits caused by meth include
ﬁndings that administration of dat inhibitors attenuates the da deﬁcits caused by
meth treatment (96, 97). schmidt & gibb (96) were among the ﬁrst to suggest
that the ability of the dat uptake inhibitor, amfonelic acid, to prevent the methinduced deﬁcits was due to an inhibition of transporter-mediated da efﬂux rather
than transporter-mediated uptake of meth. furthermore, dat knockout mice are
resistant to the persistent deﬁcits caused by the stimulant (98).
the  xxxg2099xxx -2 also contributes to the persistent da deﬁcits caused by meth, as
evidenced by ﬁndings that reserpine pretreatment worsens this damage (99). moreover,  xxxg2099xxx -2 heterozygote knockout mice are more susceptible to meth-induced
da deﬁcits than wild-type controls (100). in addition, meth treatment of ventral
midbrain neuronal cultures prepared from  xxxg2099xxx -2-deﬁcient mice caused greater
degeneration of da neurites and accumulation of da-associated reactive species
compared with control cultures (101). finally, important evidence suggesting that
aberrant  xxxg2099xxx -2 function contributes to the persistent da deﬁcits caused by meth
includes ﬁndings that posttreatment with the pharmacologically distinct agents mpd
(72) and lobeline (73) reverse meth-induced alterations in  xxxg2099xxx -2 as assessed 6
and 24 h after meth exposure, respectively. these treatments also rescue da neurons (i.e., prevent persistent da deﬁcits). thus, given that the neurochemical deﬁcits
induced by the meth model are, at least in part, deﬁcits associated with dopaminergic neurodegenerative disorders, study of the role of transporters as contributing
to this damage merits attention.

conclusion
considerable effort has been devoted toward understanding mechanisms whereby
amph and its analogs affect monoaminergic neuronal function. in vivo and in vitro
studies, such as those described above, have not only elucidated the mechanisms of
amph and its analogs on monoaminergic systems, but also provide critical understanding of the physiological and pathological processes associated with monoaminergic function and regulation. this insight can lay the foundation for comprehending
the basis of not only drug abuse and addiction and the cellular nature of neurodegenerative events but also may suggest leads for developing related novel and more
effective therapeutic strategies.
