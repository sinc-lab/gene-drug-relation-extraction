interneuronal networks in the spinal ventral horn are plausible substrates for mediating anestheticinduced immobility. here, we investigated how their activity is affected by clinically relevant concentrations of  xxxd3354xxx , a barbiturate in clinical use. in cultured spinal cord slices from mice,  xxxd3354xxx 
reduced action potential activity with an ec50 of 16.6  2.4 mm. recordings of gabaa and glycine
receptor-mediated inhibitory currents indicated that the effect was largely mediated by gabaa receptors
and that glycine receptors were not relevant targets. speciﬁcally, 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  prolonged the decay
time of spontaneous gabaergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sipscs) more than twofold. although
this prolongation of decay time increased the inhibitory charge per sipsc the concomitant strong reduction of sipsc frequency resulted in less inhibitory current entering the neurons via this route.
however, 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  also induced a tonic current of 30  10 pa, mediated by gabaa receptors;
50 mm  xxxd3354xxx  nearly abolished sipsc activity but augmented tonic currents to 69  14 pa. furthermore, at this concentration, activity-depressing mechanisms independent of gabaa receptors came into
play. the results suggest that in the spinal ventral horn  xxxd3354xxx  acts mostly, but not exclusively, via
gabaa receptors. with increasing concentrations of the drug, inhibition via sipscs is limited by negative
feedback on interneuronal ﬁring whereas action potential-independent gabaergic inhibition due to
tonic currents gains progressively in impact.

1. introduction
continuous and stereotyped motor actions such as locomotion
are controlled by neuronal networks which are located in the
ventral horn of the spinal cord (marder and calabrese, 1996; beato
and nistri, 1999; kiehn, 2006). there is ample evidence that these
pattern-generating microcircuits are important for mediating anesthetic-induced immobility (collins et al., 1995; jinks et al., 2005;
kim et al., 2007). therefore, gaining knowledge about the molecular targets of anesthetics in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and
their impact on network activity therein will aid in understanding
the clinical proﬁle of currently used anesthetics and in designing
novel anesthetic strategies. using an in vitro model of mouse spinal
cord, we have recently studied the mechanisms by which two
classes of anesthetics affect action potential activity in ventral horn
networks. the volatile anesthetics enﬂurane, isoﬂurane and sevoﬂurane completely abolished spontaneous action potential ﬁring at
the higher end of clinically relevant concentrations (grasshoff and
antkowiak, 2004, 2006). the volatile agents mediated their effects
via  xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptors, glycine

receptors and other ion channels. by contrast, the intravenous anesthetics propofol and etomidate were far less capable of reducing
neuronal activity: the concentration-dependent depression of discharge rates reached a limit of approximately 60% (grasshoff and
antkowiak, 2004; grasshoff et al., 2007). both drugs altered the
activity of ventral horn neurons almost exclusively by enhancing
gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition (grasshoff and antkowiak,
2004; grasshoff et al., 2006). thus, anesthetics with a broad range
of targets like volatile anesthetics (campagna et al., 2003) may
generally be more capable of depressing spinal network activity
than more selective anesthetics like etomidate and propofol.
these observations prompt questions about the characteristics
of other anesthetic compounds in the spinal cord. here, we characterized the barbiturate  xxxd3354xxx  with regard to anesthetic efﬁcacy and target speciﬁcity in the ventral horn of the spinal cord in
vitro. it is well established that  xxxd3354xxx  enhances gabaa receptor function (lukatch and maciver, 1996; dickinson et al., 2002;
yang et al., 2006). there is also evidence that  xxxd3354xxx  affects
glycine receptors, which form part of the other major inhibitory
transmitter system in spinal cord (hadipour-jahromy and daniels,
2003). at high concentrations, additional molecular targets may
come into play (lu et al., 2006; ohtsuka et al., 2006). exploiting the
exquisite sensitivity of spontaneously active spinal networks in

vitro, we assessed to what degree  xxxd3354xxx  is capable of depressing network activity of ventral horn interneurons and which
of the currently discussed molecular mechanisms are involved. our
results show that  xxxd3354xxx  depressed network activity by 87%,
acting mostly, but not exclusively, via gabaa receptors. with increasing concentrations,  xxxd3354xxx ’s impact shifted from phasic to
tonic gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition.
2. materials and methods
2.1. spinal slice cultures
all procedures were approved by the animal care committee (eberhard-karlsuniversity, tuebingen, germany) and were in accordance with german law on
animal experimentation. all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and
the number of animals used. we used organotypic cultures of spinal cord slices
from embryos of wild type mice (e 14-15, 129/sv strain). maturing in vitro and
developing spontaneous network activity, these preparations are established in
vitro models of the spinal cord (braschler et al., 1989; spenger et al., 1991; ballerini
and galante, 1998; ballerini et al., 1999; darbon et al., 2002; avossa et al., 2003).
the preparation of spinal cord slices was performed according to the method
originally described by braschler and coworkers (1989) and as previously reported
(grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004). pregnant mice were deeply anesthetized with
isoﬂurane, and the uterus was aseptically removed into a sterile petri dish. embryos were freed from the uterus and placed in ice-cold gey’s  xxxd2988xxx  consisting of 2.0 mm cacl2, 5.0 mm kcl, 0.22 mm kh2po4, 0.84 mm
na2hpo4, 11 mm mgcl2, 0.3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 120 mm nacl, 27 mm nahco3, and 33 mm
d-glucose. spinal columns were freed from inner organs and limbs and were cut
transversely into 300 mm thick slices using a vibratome. the slices were placed on
a coverslip and embedded in a plasma clot consisting of 13 ml heparin-treated
chicken plasma (sigma, taufkirchen, germany) and coagulated by 13 ml of
a thrombin solution (sigma). the coverslips were inserted into plastic tubes containing 0.75 ml of nutrient ﬂuid including 10 nm neuronal growth factor (sigma)
and initially incubated in an atmosphere of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide at
36.0  c for 1–2 h. nutrient ﬂuid was obtained by mixing 250 ml horse serum
(invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany), 250 ml hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (sigma),
500 ml basal medium eagle (sigma), 5 ml glutamine solution (200 mm, sigma) and
10 ml glucose solution (50%, sigma). the roller tube technique described by
gähwiler was used to maintain the tissue (gähwiler, 1981). after one day in
culture, antimitotics (10 mm 5-ﬂuoro-2-deoxyuridine, 10 mm cytosine-beta-darabino-furanoside, 10 mm uridine [all from sigma]) were added to reduce proliferation of glial cells. the slices were used after 14 days in vitro (for whole cell
recordings also after 12 days in vitro).
2.2. extracellular recordings
the spinal cord slices were continuously perfused with artiﬁcial cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (acsf) consisting of 120 mm nacl, 3.3 mm kcl, 1.13 mm nah2po4, 26 mm
nahco3, 1.8 mm cacl2, and 11 mm d-glucose. the acsf was bubbled with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. bath temperature was 35  c. glass electrodes ﬁlled with
acsf (resistance approximately 2–5 mu) were used for recording extracellular
signals, which were bandpass ﬁltered (passband 200–5000 hz) in order to isolate
action potential activity. the electrodes were advanced into the tissue until extracellular single or multi-unit spike activity (usually exceeding 100 mv in amplitude)
could be clearly identiﬁed. signals were digitized on a pc  xxxd1891xxx  khz via a digidata
1200 analogue to digital/digital to analogue interface and axoscope (axon instruments, union city, california, usa).
2.3. whole cell voltage-clamp recordings
whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed on visually identiﬁed
ventral horn interneurons at room temperature (20–24  c). the cultures were
perfused with acsf as speciﬁed above which additionally contained cnqx (50 mm),
apv (50 mm), strychnine (1 mm) and mg2þ (1 mm). signals were acquired with an
epc 7 ampliﬁer (list medical, darmstadt, germany), lowpass ﬁltered at 3 khz and
digitized on a pc  xxxd1891xxx  khz via a digidata 1200 interface and clampex (axon instruments). patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (1.5 mm od) and
coated with sylgard. pipette resistances were between 1.5 mu and 2.5 mu after ﬁre
polishing. the pipette solution contained (in mm): 121 cscl, 24 csoh, 10 n-2hydroxyethyl-piperazine-n0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes), 5 ethyleneglycol-bis-(baminoethylether)-n,n,n0 ,n0 -tetraacetic acid (egta), 1 mgcl2, and 2 atp, adjusted to
ph 7.3 with 1 m naoh. cells were held at 70 mv.
2.4. perforated patch current-clamp recordings
perforated patch recordings were performed in conjunction with gaba puff
application to assess the reversal potential of gabaa receptor-mediated currents
in spinal ventral horn interneurons. patch pipettes with resistances of 3.5–4 mu
were tip-ﬁlled with an intracellular solution containing (in mm): 135 kcl, 5

nacl, 10 hepes, 5 egta, 0.5 cacl2, adjusted to ph 7.3 with 1 m koh. the pipettes
were back-ﬁlled with the same solution containing 20 mg/ml gramicidin a
(sigma). after a gigaseal was established electrode capacitance was compensated
and incorporation of the ionophore into the membrane was monitored in
voltage-clamp mode by quantifying the peak transient currents elicited by
hyperpolarizing voltage steps (10 mv). current-clamp recordings commenced
when the series resistance had dropped to less than 100 mu (usually 20–40 min
after seal formation). series resistance was regularly checked and compensated
for by adjusting the ampliﬁer’s (multiclamp 700a, molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca, usa) bridge balance. a (calculated) liquid junction potential of 3.4 mv was
subtracted from all traces.
gaba (100 mm) was applied to the recorded neuron via pressure ejection from
an electrode with w2 mu resistance, placed at a distance of 50–100 mm from the
soma. besides cnqx, apv and strychnine (same concentrations as above) the gabab
receptor blocker cgp 55845 (5 mm) was added to the bath solution.
2.5. preparation and application of test solutions
test solutions were prepared by dissolving  xxxd3354xxx  (sigma) in acsf equilibrated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. the solution was administered via
the bath perfusion using gas-tight syringe pumps (zak medicine technique,
marktheidenfeld, germany) which were connected to the experimental chamber via
teﬂon tubing (lee, frankfurt, germany). the ﬂow rate was approximately 1 ml/min.
to ensure steady-state conditions, recordings during anesthetic treatment were
carried out 10–15 min after starting the perfusate change.
2.6. data analysis
data were analyzed with in-house software written in originpro version 7
(originlab corporation, northampton, massachusetts, usa) and matlab version 7.1
(the mathworks inc., natick, massachusetts, usa).
analysis of extracellular recordings was performed as previously described
(grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004). after close inspection of the raw data action potentials were detected by setting a threshold well above base line noise. the mean
ﬁring rate was obtained from single or multi-unit activity; it is deﬁned as the
number of detected action potentials divided by the recording time of 180 s. the
natural ﬁring mode of spinal ventral horn neurons in culture consisted of bursts of
action potentials separated by silent periods (fig. 1a). a burst was deﬁned as a group
of action potentials with an inter-spike-interval of less than 0.5 s. the burst rate was
calculated as the number of bursts occurring during the recording period (180 s). in
order to quantify the peak ﬁring rate, the bursts were aligned in time, subdivided
into 50 ms bins and averaged. the peak ﬁring rate represents the highest ﬁring
frequency within the averaged burst.
analysis of base line currents (tonic currents) followed the method proposed
by glykys and mody (2007). the current traces were downsampled by a factor of
two and divided into segments of 10,000 data points, corresponding to 2 s. from
each segment, an all-points histogram was computed. the histograms had a single peak and – due to the presence of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (sipscs) – were skewed toward more negative values. a gaussian was
ﬁtted to the unskewed part of the histogram including the peak and the next two
bins toward the skewed ﬂank. the abscissa value of the gaussian’s maximum was
taken as the base line of the data segment, and the standard deviation served as
a measure of the base line ﬂuctuation. next, the control recording was inspected
for trends in the base line. if the currents changed by more than 0.15 pa/s the
experiment was omitted from analysis, otherwise the slope as present in the
control recording was subtracted from all raw data of an experiment. the computational process was then reiterated. finally, the base line and ﬂuctuation
values obtained from individual data segments were averaged within each condition (control, drug application, wash).
sipscs (phasic currents) were detected and counted by setting a threshold. all
detected sipscs of a recording were individually scrutinized and discarded if they
overlapped with neighboring events. they were then base line-corrected and
averaged. current decays were ﬁtted with a monoexponential function
(y(t) ¼ a  exp(t/s); t ¼ 0 corresponded to the peak of the averaged sipsc) from
which both the amplitude (a) and decay time (s) were extracted. the charge transfer
per sipsc (fig. 7d) was calculated as the product of the two parameters. the frequency of events was determined by combining the counts of isolated and overlapping sipscs. the average charge transfer via phasic currents (sipscs) into the
neurons was computed in two different ways. one approach was to multiply the
charge transfer per sipsc with the frequency of sipscs (fig. 7e). the other approach
consisted of computing the segment-wise iphasic (glykys and mody, 2007): from
each 2 s segment as mentioned above the base line was subtracted. the mean of the
data points thus obtained yielded the mean phasic current in the segment; these
were then averaged (fig. 7f).
statistics was performed with a two-tailed student’s t-test for paired data or,
where applicable, one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference procedure. unless otherwise stated, results are given as
mean  s.e.m. concentration–response curves were ﬁtted by hill equations, as
previously described (antkowiak and helfrich, 1998). estimated ec50 values were
derived from these ﬁts.

and 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx . the average ﬁring rates were 8.6 hz (control), 5.2 hz (10 mm), and 2.3 hz (20 mm); burst rates were 0.3 hz (control), 0.3 hz (10 mm), and 0.4 hz (20 mm). (b)

3. results
organotypic spinal slices were used after 14 days in vitro for
extracellular recordings. ventral horn interneurons, the neurons
recorded from in this study, were visually identiﬁed by means of
size, shape and location (spenger et al., 1991; streit et al., 1991;
ballerini and galante, 1998). the mean ﬁring rate and the burst rate
of these neurons remained stable over a period of 2–5 weeks, as
recently reported (grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004).
3.1. effects of  xxxd3354xxx  on average discharge rates and ﬁring
patterns of spinal ventral horn interneurons
fig.1 shows a representative example of the effects of  xxxd3354xxx  on
the discharge rates of spinal ventral horn interneurons. short excerpts
of raw data with spontaneously occurring bursts of action potentials,
separated by silent periods, are depicted in fig. 1a.  xxxd3354xxx  decreased this spontaneous network activity in a concentration-dependent way. in fig. 1b binned ﬁring rates are shown for the same
recordings as in fig. 1a. the data for 10 mm and 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  are
essentially downscaled versions of the patterns seen under control
conditions, indicating that  xxxd3354xxx  reduced average ﬁring rates but

did not impose major changes on the ﬁring mode of the spinal network. the fact that plots of cumulative spike activity (fig. 1c) had
largely constant slopes under all conditions conﬁrms this ﬁnding.
the effects of  xxxd3354xxx  on average discharge rates of spinal
interneurons are summarized in fig. 2a.  xxxd3354xxx  caused a maximal depression of action potential activity of 87.3  5.0% with an
ec50 of 16.6  2.4 mm. we also assessed  xxxd3354xxx ’s effects on ﬁring
patterns as in previous studies (grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004,
2006) by quantifying the burst rate and the peak ﬁring rate within
bursts (fig. 2b and c). peak ﬁring rates decreased in a concentration-dependent manner with an ec50 of 12.5  6.4 mm, which was
close to that for the depression of average ﬁring rates (fig. 2a).
burst rates were largely unaffected by  xxxd3354xxx  (fig. 2c): although
at the lowest concentration tested (2.5 mm) the burst rate was on
average increased by 50% linear regression did not indicate a signiﬁcant effect of  xxxd3354xxx  on burst rates (p ¼ 0.17).
3.2. contribution of gabaa and glycine receptors to the depressant
effects of  xxxd3354xxx 
to assess whether gabaa and glycine receptors are relevant
targets of  xxxd3354xxx  in the ventral horn we compared  xxxd3354xxx ’s

efﬁcacy in depressing ongoing activity in the absence and presence
of bicuculline (antagonist at gabaa receptors) and strychnine
(antagonist at glycine receptors). the rationale for this approach
was that the depressant effect of an anesthetic agent remaining
after pharmacological blockade of a receptor will reveal the extent
to which the anesthetic agent mediates its effect via other receptors
(antkowiak, 1999; sonner et al., 2003a,b; grasshoff and antkowiak,
2004). as gabaa and glycine receptors form part of major transmitter systems in the spinal cord their blockade modulated the
characteristics of basal neural activity, as reported previously
(grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004): bicuculline (100 mm) and
strychnine (1 mm) increased the mean ﬁring rate and lead to
a moderate depression of the burst rate in the spinal ventral horn.
this was accounted for in our study by expressing anesthetic effects
exclusively in relative terms.
in the presence of bicuculline, 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  did not depress
ﬁring rates at all, which was in marked contrast to its effect without
bicuculline (t-test, p < 0.001, n ¼ 10, fig. 3a). a much higher concentration of  xxxd3354xxx , 75 mm, depressed ﬁring rates only by 24%
with bicuculline, compared to 75% without bicuculline. by contrast,
strychnine did not interfere with  xxxd3354xxx ’s depressant action at
either 20 mm (t-test, n ¼ 10, fig. 3a) or 75 mm (t-test, n ¼ 10, fig. 3b).
in summary, our results indicated that up to a concentration of
20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  mediated its depressant effect entirely by gabaa
receptors whereas at 75 mm targets different from gabaa receptors
also contributed. glycine receptors, however, did not contribute at
all to  xxxd3354xxx ’s depressant effect at either concentration tested.

fig. 2. depression of ﬁring rates and changes in ﬁring patterns induced by  xxxd3354xxx .
for each concentration, the mean value and standard error were obtained from 8 to 10
recordings. (a) depression of mean ﬁring rates. the curve represents a hill ﬁt to the
data (r2 ¼ 0.987). the half-maximal effect (ec50) occurred at 16.6  2.4 mm and the
maximal depression was 87.3  5.0%. (b) depression of peak ﬁring rates (the highest
ﬁring frequency within the averaged burst). the data were ﬁtted to a hill equation
(r2 ¼ 0.995; ec50 ¼ 12.5  6.4 mm). (c) depression of burst rate. the line is a linear ﬁt
through the data (r2 ¼ 0.033).  xxxd3354xxx  had no signiﬁcant effect on burst rate
(p ¼ 0.17).

the previous results suggested that 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  was close
to the concentration at which the gabaergic contribution of the
anesthetic’s depressant effect saturated: at both 20 mm and 75 mm
 xxxd3354xxx , gabaergic currents mediated 50–60% depression of
ﬁring rates (fig. 3). a saturation of gabaa-mediated effects on
action potential depression was surprising inasmuch as effects of
 xxxd3354xxx  on gabaa receptor-mediated currents are far from saturated at 20 mm, as shown in rat hippocampal neurons (dickinson
et al., 2002) and rat spinal dorsal horn neurons (yang et al., 2006).
we presumed that the strong reduction of spontaneous activity by
 xxxd3354xxx  constituted a negative feedback on gabaergic inhibition
within the ventral horn, and performed intracellular recordings to
test this assumption. in order to isolate gabaergic currents, the
recordings were performed in the presence of blockers of glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. fig. 4a shows an
exemplary recording of gabaergic currents and their changes by
50 mm  xxxd3354xxx .  xxxd3354xxx  had several striking effects. during
the initial phase of drug application, sipscs disappeared shortly and
started to reappear at a much lower rate about 1 min after the
initial suppression. second, the current base line sloped toward
more negative values, settling to a stable level that was about 60 pa
more negative than under control conditions in the recording
shown. third, sipscs had a greatly prolonged decay time (fig. 4a,
excerpt labelled ‘b’ shows an example). fourth, current ﬂuctuations
which were not attributable to sipscs increased. when bicuculline
(100 mm) was added, sipscs were abolished. furthermore, the
 xxxd3354xxx -induced increases of holding current and base line
ﬂuctuations reverted close to control levels, indicating that these
phenomena were also mediated by gabaa receptors. effects of both
 xxxd3354xxx  and bicuculline were partly reversible after washout of
both drugs (fig. 4a, excerpt labelled ‘d’). fig. 4c and d summarizes
 xxxd3354xxx -induced alterations of the current base line. both 20 mm
and 50 mm  xxxd3354xxx  induced a tonic current, but current ﬂuctuations were enhanced relative to control only at the higher
concentration.

were young (12 days in vitro) it was conceivable that  xxxd3354xxx 
depressed ﬁring activity by imposing a gabaa receptormediated depolarization block on the neurons. in order to clarify this
issue we performed perforated patch recordings with gramicidin,
a cation-selective ionophore which leaves intracellular chloride
concentrations unaltered (ebihara et al., 1995). in the presence of
blockers of gabab receptors and of glutamatergic and glycinergic
synaptic transmission the neurons were held in current-clamp mode
(n ¼ 4, after 12–13 days in vitro). a constant small hyperpolarizing
current (10 pa to 20 pa) was injected into the neurons to prevent
them from ﬁring spontaneously. the neurons were then depolarized
for 4.4 s by a positive current (25–50 pa) so that they produced robust action potential activity (an example is shown in fig. 5a). when
a puff of gaba (100 mm) was directed at the soma 500 ms after the
depolarization step the neurons hyperpolarized temporarily to
minimal values of 65.2  5.9 mv, well below the threshold for action potential generation (fig. 5b). seconds after rupture of the
perforated membrane patch, resulting in the dialysis of the neuron
with the pipette solution containing 140 mm chloride, a gaba puff
caused a strong depolarization to 20.6  5.0 mv which also suppressed action potential activity, presumably via depolarization
block (fig. 5c). thus, we conclude that intracellular chloride concentration in ventral horn interneurons of organotypic cultures is
close to the adult state after 12 days in vitro and that gabaa receptor-mediated currents are hyperpolarizing.

ﬁring rates by 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  under control conditions (left bar), with bicuculline
(center) and with strychnine (right). 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  depressed ﬁring rates by w59%
under control conditions but had no effect with bicuculline (n ¼ 10). blockade of glycine receptors did not diminish the action potential-depressant effect of  xxxd3354xxx . (b)
depression of ﬁring rates by 75 mm  xxxd3354xxx  in the same conditions as in a. in the
presence of bicuculline, 75 mm  xxxd3354xxx  depressed ﬁring rates only by 24 %, compared to 75% without bicuculline (n ¼ 10). again, strychnine did not abate  xxxd3354xxx ’s
depressant effect.

the  xxxd3354xxx -induced shift of the current base line could be
due to an enhancement of tonic gabaergic currents produced by
minute concentrations of ambient gaba (farrant and nusser,
2005). however, we did not ﬁnd clear evidence for tonic gabaergic
currents in ventral horn interneurons. current ﬂuctuations were
diminished by a blockade of gabaa receptors, but base lines were
not signiﬁcantly affected (fig. 4b and c), a fact which points to
a direct activation of gabaa receptors by  xxxd3354xxx  (see section 4).
3.4. gabaa receptor-mediated currents in ventral horn
interneurons of organotypic cultures are hyperpolarizing
currents through gabaa receptors usually hyperpolarize and/or
shunt neurons. however, depending on the transmembrane chloride
gradient gabaergic currents can also be depolarizing, especially in
juvenile neurons of the mammalian cns. as the cultures we used

in the following, we focus on the effects of  xxxd3354xxx  on
gabaergic sipscs. as our experiments necessitated suppressing
glutamatergic synaptic transmission an important point to clarify at
the outset was to what degree the sipscs we observed were action
potential mediated. fig. 6a and b shows that sipscs were almost
completely abolished with tetrodotoxin (ttx), clearly indicating
that they were produced by action potentials under control conditions. fig. 6c and d displays the effects of 20 mm  xxxd3354xxx  on
gabaergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sipscs).
inspection of the raw data traces (fig. 6c) and averaged sipscs
extracted from these (fig. 6d) revealed that  xxxd3354xxx  prolonged
sipscs and reduced their frequency. fig. 7 presents a quantitative
analysis of these and other sipsc parameters. as in the brain,
 xxxd3354xxx  increased decay times in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 7a). it also reduced the amplitude (fig. 7b) and particularly the frequency (fig. 7c) of sipscs. consequently, we asked
how these counteracting effects combined in terms of the net inhibitory currents entering the neurons. fig. 7d illustrates that the
average charge transferred per sipsc increased with anesthetic
concentration. by contrast, the total charge transferred by sipscs
(the integral of averaged sipscs multiplied by their frequency) diminished with  xxxd3354xxx  (fig. 7e), particularly at the higher concentration. iphasic, an alternative measure of the charge carried by
phasic currents (glykys and mody, 2007), was affected in a very
similar way. these ﬁndings indicated that the  xxxd3354xxx -induced
reduction of gabaergic sipsc frequency and amplitude more than
counterbalanced their prolongation.
we also quantiﬁed  xxxd3354xxx ’s actions on glycinergic sipscs.
table 1 compares the changes of decay time and frequency of
gabaergic and glycinergic sipscs caused by 50 mm  xxxd3354xxx . in
striking contrast to the more than sixfold prolongation of the decay
time of gabaergic sipscs, no change in decay times of glycinergic
sipscs was found. the frequency of glycinergic sipscs appeared to
decrease with  xxxd3354xxx , but the effect was not signiﬁcant
(p ¼ 0.07). in conjunction with the fact that strychnine did not alter
 xxxd3354xxx ’s activity-depressing efﬁcacy these results suggest that
glycine receptors are not relevant molecular targets of  xxxd3354xxx  in
the ventral horn of the spinal cord.

4. discussion
4.1.  xxxd3354xxx  attenuates action potential activity at clinically
relevant concentrations
in the present study  xxxd3354xxx  caused a half-maximal depression of mean ﬁring rates of ventral horn neurons at a concentration close to 20 mm. this value is well within the range of
concentrations producing clinical anesthesia in humans and experimental animals. hung and coworkers (1992) determined an
ec50 of 15.6 mg/ml for a loss of reaction to verbal commands, an
estimate of hypnosis. assuming a binding of  xxxd3354xxx  to protein
of 85% (franks and lieb, 1994), this value translates into a free
aqueous concentration of 10 mm. in the same study, the ec50
concentrations for the suppression of movement to a painful
trapezius muscle squeeze and for laryngoscopy followed by intubation were 25 mm and 50 mm, respectively (hung et al., 1992).
ec50 values for several behavioral end points in rats are comparable: approximately 10 mm for the suppression of the righting
reﬂex, a surrogate measure of hypnosis, and 25 mm and 42 mm for
the suppression of limb movement in response to tail clamp and
to intubation, respectively (gustafsson et al., 1996). in summary,

it can be assumed that clinical anesthesia is caused by a free
aqueous concentration of 10–50 mm  xxxd3354xxx . therefore, we
consider anesthetic concentrations used in the present study as
clinically relevant.
4.2. gabaa receptors as the major molecular target of  xxxd3354xxx  in
the ventral horn of spinal cord
in vitro assays have shown that barbiturates modulate a variety of ligand-gated ion channels including gabaa, glycine and
glutamate receptors at concentrations ranging between 10 mm
and 1000 mm. it is not well established which of these molecular
targets contribute to barbiturate anesthesia in a signiﬁcant way.
in a recent study in vivo, zeller and coworkers have taken an
important step toward identifying relevant targets of barbiturates. they investigated mice with mutant b3 subunit-containing
gabaa receptors (n265m) which are insensitive to several general anesthetics (zeller et al., 2007). in these mutant mice, a bolus
of 50–75 mg/kg pentobarbital i.v. failed to depress painfulstimuli evoked movements, and the anesthetic-induced loss of
the righting reﬂex was briefer than in wild types. these ﬁndings
permit the conclusion that the anesthetic properties of

at which the pressure valve opened; the delay of the neuron’s response was due to the

constant on the order of a few hundred milliseconds. (c) response to a gaba puff after

pentobarbital are largely mediated via gabaa receptors. our results, as well as recent in vitro work in the spinal dorsal horn
(yang et al., 2006), suggest that this may also hold for the barbiturate  xxxd3354xxx . we observed that in the spinal ventral horn
 xxxd3354xxx -induced tonic currents and signiﬁcantly enhanced the
decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. both effects were
gabaa receptor-mediated. furthermore, up to concentrations
normally depressing ﬁring rates by slightly above 50%,  xxxd3354xxx 
lost all action potential depressing efﬁcacy when the gabaa
antagonist bicuculline was present. thus, our study provides
further evidence that the clinical actions of barbiturates are
predominantly mediated by gabaa receptors.

caused a prolongation of decay times from 24.6 ms (control) to 59.7 ms. the effect was
reversible (decay time was 25.7 ms after washout of the drug). the frequency of sipscs
was reduced from 0.8 hz (control) to 0.5 hz (20 mm  xxxd3354xxx ); it reverted to 0.9 hz
after washout. (d) averaged sipscs of the corresponding recordings displayed in a.

4.3. two different modes of gabaergic inhibition differentially
affected by  xxxd3354xxx 
we found that  xxxd3354xxx  affected two different ‘modes’ of
gabaergic inhibition: phasic currents (sipscs), which were almost
exclusively mediated by action potentials, and tonic currents, visible as drug-induced changes in the base line. tonic currents may
have been induced by direct activation of gabaa receptors or by an
enhancement of currents already existing under control conditions
(which would require minute concentrations of ambient gaba)
(farrant and nusser, 2005). in our data, a number of facts point to
a direct activation of gabaa receptors. first, under control conditions, we did not detect signiﬁcant tonic gabaergic currents. second, 50 mm  xxxd3354xxx  enhanced base line current ﬂuctuations,
which is a hallmark of receptor activation (katz and miledi, 1972;

barker et al., 1982). third, while mounting  xxxd3354xxx  concentrations depressed ﬁring rates and ipsc frequency, and thus most
likely reduced ambient gaba concentration (glykys and mody,
2007), tonic currents grew. finally, the reduction of sipsc amplitude by  xxxd3354xxx  may indicate that fewer receptors were available

sipscs were recorded in the presence of cnqx (50 mm), apv (50 mm) and either
strychnine (1 mm, n ¼ 9) for gabaergic or bicuculline (100 mm, n ¼ 5) for glycinergic
currents. statistical analysis was performed by means of a paired t-test (**p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001).

for activation by gaba, as would be expected in the presence of
a substance with agonistic properties. alternatively, a depression of
presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium conductances may explain
the decrease of sipsc amplitude (zhan et al., 1998; yang et al.,
2006). in summary, our ﬁndings are in line with other studies
providing evidence for direct activation of gabaa receptors by
 xxxd3354xxx  (lukatch and maciver, 1996; yang et al., 2006). yet, we
cannot exclude the possibility that tonic gabaergic currents do
exist (and were ampliﬁed by  xxxd3354xxx ) in interneurons in the
ventral horn; they may have been too small to be measurable under
our control conditions which necessitated blocking excitatory
synaptic transmission and thus possibly resulted in little ambient
gaba.
 xxxd3354xxx ’s effects on phasic inhibition were complex: it altered sipsc decay time, amplitude and frequency, all of which factor
into the net inhibitory current entering the neurons. conceivably,
low concentrations of  xxxd3354xxx  amplify net phasic inhibition.

c. grasshoff et al. / neuropharmacology 55 (2008) 793–802

however, assessing phasic currents only at concentrations which
depress action potentials by more than 50%, we found that the net
phasic inhibitory current decreased with increasing concentrations
of  xxxd3354xxx  (fig. 7e and f). this seemingly paradoxical result was
obtained with two independent quantitative methods. obviously,
 xxxd3354xxx ’s effect on the gabaergic network – strong depression of
sipsc rates – more than counterbalanced the effect at the receptor –
prolongation of sipscs. thus, our ﬁndings suggest that at concentrations beyond the ec50 for action potential depression tonic
currents through gabaa receptors and other inhibitory mechanisms (see below) drive ventral horn networks into an activity
regime in which phasic gabaergic inhibition is of diminished
importance.
4.4. putative molecular targets at high concentrations
at high concentrations,  xxxd3354xxx  recruits additional molecular
targets. in quantitative terms, 75 mm  xxxd3354xxx  exerted approximately one-third of its effects via targets distinct from the gabaa
receptor (fig. 3). we considered glycine receptors as candidates
because they abound in spinal cord and are reportedly affected by
barbiturates in spinal dorsal horn neurons (lu and xu, 2002).
however, even at 50 mm,  xxxd3354xxx  did not prolong  xxxg904xxx -mediated inhibitory synaptic currents. furthermore, in the
presence of the  xxxg904xxx  antagonist strychnine,  xxxd3354xxx 
reduced action potential activity unabatedly. both ﬁndings render
glycine receptors unlikely mediators of the effects of  xxxd3354xxx  on
ventral horn neurons.
a range of further molecular targets have been reported for
 xxxd3354xxx . studies by lukatch and maciver (1996) suggest that an
antagonism at nmda receptors may play a role for the depressant
actions of high concentrations of  xxxd3354xxx  (50–70 mm) on cortical
network activity (lukatch et al., 2005). this is in line with ﬁndings
by liu and coworkers (liu et al., 2006) who reported that  xxxd3354xxx 
decreased the amplitude of nmda-gated currents with an ec50 of
33.6 mm. by contrast, dickinson and coworkers (2002) found that
 xxxd3354xxx  had no effect on glutamatergic postsynaptic currents in
rat hippocampal neurons. moreover, it was argued that calcium
channels targeted by  xxxd3354xxx  (zhan et al., 1998; todorovic et al.,
2000; lingamaneni and hemmings, 2003) are unlikely to play an
important role in mediating anesthesia as  xxxd3354xxx  affects these
channels at concentrations far beyond the clinically relevant range
(dickinson et al., 2002). apart from nmda receptors and calcium
channels, potassium channels have been reported to be affected by
barbiturates (friederich and urban, 1999; liu et al., 2004). ohtsuka
and coworkers (2006) demonstrated that  xxxd3354xxx  induced
a concentration-dependent reduction of the atp depletion-induced
outward potassium current in substantia nigra neurons starting at
30 mm. in conclusion, given the relatively sparse and partly conﬂicting data on the molecular targets of  xxxd3354xxx , we are currently
left with a number of potential molecular targets different from
gabaa and glycine receptors which contribute to the activitydepressant effect of  xxxd3354xxx  at high concentrations in the spinal
cord.
4.5. multiplicity of molecular targets of several anesthetics
correlates with their potency
how does  xxxd3354xxx  relate to other anesthetic compounds with
regard to target selectivity and anesthetic efﬁcacy? in vitro
(grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004; grasshoff et al., 2007) as well as in
vivo work (jurd et al., 2003) strongly suggests that the intravenous
anesthetics etomidate and propofol produce immobility almost
exclusively via gabaa receptors. volatile anesthetics, by contrast,
target a multitude of conductances in spinal cord, among them
gabaa receptors, glycine receptors, glutamate receptors and two

801

pore domain potassium channels, none of which seems to be
dominant in mediating immobility (cheng and kendig, 2000, 2003;
wong et al., 2001; jurd et al., 2003; campagna et al., 2003;
grasshoff and antkowiak, 2004, 2006; heurteaux et al., 2004;
lambert et al., 2005).  xxxd3354xxx  is similar to propofol and etomidate inasmuch as the gabaa receptor is a major molecular target.
however, it also induces tonic gabaergic currents through direct
activation of the receptors. due to this ligand-independent inhibiting action,  xxxd3354xxx  should be superior to pure modulators of
gabaa receptors whose effect on the network – depression of ﬁring
rates of gabaergic neurons – limits the impact of the very
conductance they modulate (grasshoff et al., 2007). moreover, at
high concentrations  xxxd3354xxx  exerts part of its effects via additional molecular targets. in this regard,  xxxd3354xxx  shares properties
of volatile anesthetics. fittingly, with regard to efﬁcacy in
depressing spinal interneuronal network activity,  xxxd3354xxx 
interposes between propofol and etomidate on the one hand and
volatile anesthetics on the other hand (volatile anesthetics >  xxxd3354xxx  > propofol/etomidate). thus, with the caveat of
supraspinal action of anesthetics in mind (antognini and schwartz,
1993; antognini et al., 2002) we speculate that the heterogeneity of
molecular targets and mechanisms of action of anesthetics are
determinants of their immobilizing properties, as suggested by the
ﬁnding of signiﬁcantly more purposeful movements in patients
with propofol anesthesia versus anesthesia with volatile anesthetics (ashworth and smith, 1998; smith and thwaites, 1999;
watson and shah, 2000).
