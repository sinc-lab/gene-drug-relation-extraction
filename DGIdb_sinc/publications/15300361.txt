abstract the  xxxg2148xxx  (net) is the
carrier that drives the neuronal norepinephrine uptake
mechanism (uptake1) in mammalian hearts. the radioligand [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binds with high affinity to net. in this
study, the kinetics of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net were
measured using a rat heart membrane preparation. results
from these studies were used to set up saturation binding
assays designed to measure cardiac net densities (bmax)
and competitive inhibition assays designed to measure
inhibitor binding affinities (ki) for net. saturation
binding assays measured net densities in rat, rabbit,
and canine hearts. assay reproducibility was assessed and
the effect of nacl concentration on [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding
to net was studied using membranes from rat and canine
hearts. specificity of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net was
determined in experiments in which the neurotoxin 6hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) was used to selectively
destroy cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals in rats.
competitive inhibition studies measured ki values for
several net inhibitors and substrates. in kinetic studies
using rat heart membranes, [3h] xxxd2546xxx  exhibited a
dissociation rate constant koff=0.0123±0.0007 min−1 and
an
association
rate
constant
kon=0.0249
±0.0019 nm−1min−1. in saturation binding assays, [3h]
 xxxd2546xxx  binding was monophasic and saturable in all
cases. increasing the concentration of nacl in the assay
buffer increased binding affinity significantly, while only
modestly increasing bmax. injections of 6-ohda in rats
decreased measured cardiac net bmax values in a dosedependent manner, verifying that [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binds
specifically to net from sympathetic nerve terminals.
competitive inhibition studies provided net inhibitor and
substrate ki values consistent with previously reported

introduction
the autonomic nervous system plays a central role in the
regulation of cardiac function. abnormalities of cardiac
autonomic innervation have increasingly been implicated
as a major underlying factor contributing to the high
morbidity and mortality associated with sudden cardiac
death (schwartz 1998), congestive heart failure (packer
1992), diabetic autonomic neuropathy (ewing 1996),
myocardial ischemia (armour 1998) and cardiac arrhythmias (zipes 1995). with more than 300,000 deaths/year in
the united states attributed to sudden cardiac death alone
(virmani et al. 2001), increasing our understanding of the
role of autonomic dysfunction in these diseases is an
important research goal.
in an effort to provide clinicians with better tools for
investigating autonomic dysfunction, several radiotracers
have been developed at our institution for non-invasive
imaging studies of the sympathetic branch of cardiac
autonomic innervation. radiotracers that have been
successfully used as markers of cardiac sympathetic
neurons include the single-photon imaging agents [131i]
meta-iodobenzylguanidine and [123i]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mibg; wieland et al. 1981), and the positron
emission tomography (pet) radiotracers [11c]meta-hydroxyephedrine (hed; rosenspire et al. 1990), [11c]epinephrine (chakraborty et al. 1993), and [11c]phenylephrine
(del rosario et al. 1996). all of these imaging agents are
transported into sympathetic neurons by the neuronal
 xxxg2148xxx  (net) and subsequently stored
in vesicles by the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx 
( xxxg2099xxx ; raffel and wieland 2001).

10

as part of our ongoing efforts to characterize and
validate these radiotracers in animal models, we were
interested in implementing an in vitro assay to measure
net density in heart tissue samples. measurements of
cardiac net density in mammalian heart tissue samples
have previously been reported by several laboratories,
using [3h] xxxd2546xxx  (liang et al. 1989; böhm et al. 1995;
ungerer et al. 1996; mardon et al. 2003), [3h]desipramine
(raisman et al. 1982; kiyono et al. 2002a; kiyono et al.
2002b), or [3h]nisoxetine (böhm et al. 1998; leineweber
et al. 2000) as the radioligand in saturation binding assays.
cardiac net density (bmax) values measured for a given
mammalian species tend to vary from laboratory to
laboratory due to differences in the methods used for
tissue homogenization, subsequent tissue processing, and
saturation binding assay conditions. furthermore, there
appears to be scant information in the literature regarding
the kinetics of radioligand binding to cardiac net.
the present study was undertaken to characterize the
binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  to cardiac net and to use this
information in the design of equilibrium binding assays.
kinetic studies were performed to measure the dissociation constant koff (min−1) and the association constant kon
(nm−1min−1) for [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net purified
from rat hearts. these parameters were used to establish
incubation times for saturation binding assays designed to
measure cardiac net density and for competitive inhibition studies designed to measure equilibrium dissociation
constants (ki) for net substrates and inhibitors. in
addition to control studies, the influence of some
experimental conditions on saturation binding assay
results, including protein concentration and nacl concentration, were assessed. the reproducibility of the saturation binding assay was also investigated. the specificity of
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net was determined in studies in
which the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine was used to
chemically denervate the heart. finally, saturation binding
assays were performed with canine and rabbit heart tissue
to test the ability of the assay to measure net density and
binding affinity in heart samples from other mammalian
species.

materials and methods
animal care the care of all animals used in this study was done in
accordance with the animal welfare act and the national institutes
of health’s guide for the care and use of laboratory animals
(national research council 1985). animal protocols were approved
by the university committee on use and care of animals
(ucuca) at the university of michigan.
membrane preparations differential centrifugation of homogenized
heart tissue was used to obtain a membrane preparation enriched in
net. the buffer solution used for tissue homogenization (buffer a)
was 5 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm mgcl2 and 250 mm
sucrose. for most studies, the buffer solution used for the final
membrane preparation and for binding assays (buffer b) was 50 mm
 xxxd3449xxx  (ph7.4) containing 5 mm kcl and 100 mm nacl. for rat
heart studies, male sprague–dawley rats (225–350 g) were anesthetized with ether, a bilateral thoracotomy performed, and the heart
surgically removed and placed in a 100-ml beaker containing ice-

cold buffer a. the heart chambers were cut open and rinsed of
blood. after the aorta and excess vascular tissue were removed the
heart was blotted dry and weighed, then placed in a 100-ml beaker
containing 10 ml of ice-cold buffer a. the heart was minced with
scissors and transferred with the buffer to an ice-chilled 30-ml
borosilicate glass test tube. the heart pieces were homogenized
using a brinkmann polytron with a 12-mm sawtooth generator
(pt10/35, with kinematica pcu-2-110 controller, brinkmann,
westbury, ny, usa) kept at 4°c in a cold room. homogenization
was performed on setting 7 for 30 s (3×10-s bursts). the
homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 g (max) for 15 min at 4°c.
the supernatant fraction (s1) was removed with a polypropylene
transfer pipette and placed in a 10 ml polycarbonate ultracentrifugation tube. a fluffy layer of material at the interface between s1 and
the pellet (p1) was discarded with the p1 fraction. the s1 fraction
was centrifuged at 100,000 g (max) for 30 min at 4°c. the
supernatant fraction (s2) was discarded and 1 ml of ice-cold buffer b
was added to the tube. the pellet (p2) was removed intact from the
tube wall with the tip of a metal spatula and resuspended by
repeatedly pipetting the pellet and buffer mixture in and out of a
1.25-ml disposable pipettor (eppendorf combitip, brinkmann
instruments, westbury, ny, usa) ∼25 times. another 5 ml of icecold buffer b was added and the tube vortexed until a uniform
mixture was achieved. the resuspended p2 fraction was again
centrifuged at 100,000 g (max) for 30 min at 4°c. the supernatant
was discarded and the pellet (p3) resuspended in 1 ml buffer b. an
additional 5 ml of buffer b was added and the solution vortexed
until well mixed. membrane preparations were frozen at −80°c until
used for assays. protein concentrations in the membrane preparations were measured with the lowry spectrophotometric method
(lowry et al. 1951), using bovine  xxxg124xxx  for standards.
binding assays-common methods all assays were performed at
room temperature (22°c) in 96-well polystyrene microtiter assay
plates fabricated with a special non-binding surface designed to
minimize binding of radioligand to the plate wells (corning
costar #3641, corning life sciences, acton, ma, usa).
typically, total binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  to net in cardiac
membranes was determined by incubating 100 mul of membrane
preparation (∼100 mug protein), 100 mul of buffer b and 50 mul of
buffer b containing [3h] xxxd2546xxx  at the concentration required for a
given experiment, for a total reaction volume of 250 mul. to measure
non-specific [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding, identical well contents were
prepared except that the 100 mul aliquot of buffer b contained the
high affinity net inhibitor desipramine (dmi) at 25 mum (final dmi
concentration 10 mum). during incubation, assay plates were
continuously shaken on the tray of a shaking water bath. assays
were terminated by rapid filtration onto whatman gf/c glass fiber
filters using a brandel cell harvester equipped with a 24-well probe
(#m-24t, brandel, gaithersburg, md, usa). the wells and filters
were rinsed by filling the wells with ice-cold incubation buffer,
followed by filtration, 30 times in rapid succession, for a total rinse
volume of ∼15 ml. filter sheets were soaked in ice-cold incubation
buffer prior to use. individual filters were placed in 20 ml glass
scintillation vials along with 10 ml of scintillation cocktail
(universol es, icn biomedicals, irvine, ca, usa). vials were
shaken on an orbital shaker for 1 h and then allowed to stand
overnight. the next morning the activity in each vial was
determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. specific [3h]
 xxxd2546xxx  binding was determined as the difference between total
and non-specific [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding.
kinetics studies hearts from 12 rats were processed in parallel as
described above and their final membrane preparations combined.
this was done twice to yield two batches of membranes with
homogeneous net density. each kinetic study required the use of
two hearts worth of membrane preparation. six association
experiments and six dissociation experiments were performed,
three each from the two batches of homogenous membrane
preparation.

fig. 1 representative association and dissociation studies of [3h]
 xxxd2546xxx  binding to  xxxg2148xxx  (net) in rat heart
membrane preparations. for association studies, membranes were
incubated with 2.5 nm [3h] xxxd2546xxx  at 22°c in the absence (total
binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of 10 mum desipramine
to determine the time course of specific [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding out to

120 min (left). for dissociation studies, membranes were equilibrated with 1.5 nm [3h] xxxd2546xxx  for 120 min before desipramine
(final concentration 10 mum) was added at different time points to
track the dissociation of specifically bound [3h] xxxd2546xxx  out to
240 min (right). values plotted are means ± sem of quadruplicate
determinations of specific binding at each time point

saturation binding assays control studies were performed using an
age-matched group of six rats (group i). to determine assay
reproducibility, eight age-matched rats were used to prepare two
batches of membrane preparation with uniform net density
(group ii). for the first batch, the resuspended pellets from the
initial centrifugation at 100,000 g were combined, vortexed, and
divided into equal fractions before performing the final 100,000 g
centrifugation (“p2 combined”; n=4). for the second batch, the final
membrane preparations were combined, vortexed, and divided into
equal fractions (“p3 combined”; n=4). to assess the influence of the
protein concentration used in the assay, hearts from an age-matched
group of eight rats were individually processed and their final
membrane preparations combined to achieve a uniform net density
(group iii). saturation assays were performed using either 50 mug
protein/well (n=4) or 100 mug protein/well (n=4). to determine the
influence of the na+ concentration in the assay buffer on [3h]
 xxxd2546xxx  binding to net, hearts from 12 age-matched rats
(group iv) were homogenized and centrifuged at 1,000 g for
15 min. the s1 fractions from all 12 hearts were combined, mixed,
and divided into 12 equal aliquots before being put through the final
centrifugation steps (100,000 g for 30 min, twice). the final pellets
were resuspended in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4) containing 5 mm
kcl and one of three nacl concentrations: 100, 200 or 300 mm
(n=4 each).

blood. hearts were dissected into 1- to 3-g pieces, placed in
aluminum foil and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at
−80°c. the frozen heart pieces were later thawed and left
ventricular tissue samples weighing 1.5–2.0 g were minced,
homogenized and processed into membrane preparations as
previously described for rat hearts. control saturation binding
assays were performed on n=2–4 left ventricular tissue samples from
each animal using the same methods described above for rat hearts.
the influence of the na+ concentration in the assay buffer was
studied in canine heart samples. twelve left ventricular samples
from a single dog heart were homogenized, centrifuged at 1,000 g
for 15 min, the s1 fractions combined, then divided into equal
aliquots prior to the final centrifugation steps (100,000 g for 30 min,
twice). the final pellets were resuspended in assay buffer containing
100, 200 or 300 mm nacl (n=4 each).

specificity of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  for net to validate that [3h] xxxd2546xxx 
was binding specifically to net on sympathetic neurons, saturation
assays were performed in rat hearts that had varying degrees of
denervation induced chemically by in vivo administration of the
neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda). fifteen age-matched
rats were divided into five groups (n=3 each). each group received a
different injected dose of 6-ohda: 0 (controls), 3, 10, 30 and
100 mg/kg. doses of 6-ohda were administered i.p. in 0.7–0.8 ml
sterile 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  injection usp, 24 h prior to heart
removal.
dog and rabbit heart studies hearts were harvested immediately
post-mortem from six female adult mongrel dogs and three female
new zealand white rabbits that had been used for kidney imaging
experiments in a neighboring laboratory. these animals had been
anesthetized for 4.5–10 h prior to their death. dogs were anesthetized with 15–23 mg  xxxd60xxx  s.c., then 6–12 ml
pentothal 5% i.v., followed by continuous administration of 1–1.5%
isoflurane. rabbits were anesthetized with 17–19 mg xylazine i.m.,
then 120–130 mg ketamine i.m., followed by continuous administration of 1–2% isoflurane. hearts were surgically removed and
placed in a large beaker of ice-chilled sterile 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx 
irrigation solution. the heart chambers were cut open and rinsed of

measurements were performed using student’s two-tailed t-test for
two samples with equal variance, with p values <0.05 considered to
be significant.

results
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding kinetics
in kinetic studies of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to rat heart
net, data from association and dissociation studies were
all well described by single exponential processes (fig. 1).
the dissociation rate constant koff was measured to be
0.0123±0.0007 min−1 (n=6). the association constant kon
was measured to be 0.0249±0.0019 nm−1min−1 (n=6).
using these values to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant for [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net gives
kd=koff/kon=0.49±0.05 nm.
saturation binding assays
saturation binding assays were performed to measure
cardiac net density (bmax) and the equilibrium dissociation constant kd. binding parameters determined from
the saturation assays performed with rat heart membranes
are summarized in table 1. representative data from a
control saturation binding assay (group i) are shown in
fig. 2. the specific binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  to net was
saturable and monophasic in all cases. binding parameters
measured in assays in which the pellets from the first or
second centrifugation at 100,000 g were combined
(table 1; group ii) were comparable to the control
studies, but the bmax values had lower coefficients of
variation than the controls.
for assays comparing 50 mug protein/well with 100 mug
protein/well (table 1; group iii), the estimated binding
parameters for the two protein concentrations were not
statistically different, but the coefficients of variation in
the binding parameters for the 50 mug protein group were
higher than those of the 100 mug protein group.
for the rat heart assays done with increasing concentrations of nacl in the assay buffer (table 1; group iv), the
measured bmax values were significantly higher for
300 mm nacl than for 100 mm nacl (p<0.01) and
200 mm nacl (p<0.004). increasing nacl concentration
also lead to significant increases in the binding affinity of
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  for net, with the biggest change of kd
occurring between 100 and 200 mm nacl (p<9.1×10−5).
while the bmax values measured for 100 mm nacl studies

fig. 2 equilibrium saturation binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  to net in
rat heart membrane preparations. membranes were incubated at
22°c for 90 min in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 mum desipramine to determine specific
binding at eight [3h] xxxd2546xxx  concentrations (range 0.25–22 nm).
values plotted are means ± sem of triplicate determinations of total,
specific, and non-specific binding at each [3h] xxxd2546xxx  concentration. estimated binding parameters and corresponding uncertainties
for this particular saturation assay were bmax=461±7 fmol/mg
protein and kd=0.71±0.05 nm. results for all saturation binding
assays are summarized in tables 1, 2, 3

averaged ∼ 15% higher than the control values measured
for group i, this increase did not reach statistical
significance.
net density (bmax) measurements made in hearts from
rats injected with 6-ohda are shown in fig. 3. net
density decreased in a dose-dependent manner from a
control value of 533±54 fmol/mg protein to 40±1 fmol/mg
protein for the highest injected dose (100 mg/kg i.p.), a
reduction of 92%. fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose–
response function with variable slope yielded an estimated
ec50 of 12.4±0.5 mg/kg and hill slope of −2.77±0.32.
cardiac net densities in canine and rabbit hearts were
measured for comparison with the results from rat hearts.
in left ventricular samples from canine hearts, net
densities were found to be higher than those measured in
rat hearts (table 2). also, [3h] xxxd2546xxx  exhibited lower
binding affinity to net (higher kd values) in canine heart
than in rat heart. net densities in rabbit hearts were found
to be lower than the values measured in rat hearts
(table 3). the binding affinity of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  for rabbit

into membrane preparations. values plotted are the means ± sd
(n=3 each) of the net densities measured for each heart using
saturation binding assays

heart net was lower than the affinities seen in rat heart
and canine heart.
similar to the results in rat heart, increasing the nacl
concentration in the assay buffer increased the measured
net density in canine hearts (table 2; dog 6). bmax
values for 200 mm nacl and 300 mm nacl were
significantly higher than for 100 mm nacl (p<0.003 for
both comparisons). bmax values for 200 and 300 mm nacl
were not significantly different. binding affinity increased
(i.e., kd values decreased) with increasing nacl concentration, with significant changes between 100 and 200 mm
nacl (p<1.2×10−8) and between 200 and 300 mm nacl
(p<1.7×10−8).
competitive inhibition assays
competitive inhibition assays were performed using rat
heart membrane preparations to measure the equilibrium
dissociation constants (ki) of several net inhibitors and
substrates (table 4). representative competition curves are
shown in fig. 4. the curves were all well described by a
monophasic inhibition process and in most cases the hill
slopes were close to unity.

fig. 4 inhibition of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net in rat heart
membranes by various net inhibitors and substrates. membranes
were incubated with ∼1.3 nm [3h] xxxd2546xxx  at 22°c for 180 min in
the absence (control binding) or presence of increasing concentrations of the net inhibitor or substrate. non-specific binding was
determined using 10 mum desipramine. after correcting for nonspecific binding, values were normalized to the control and
expressed as percentage specific binding. values plotted are means
± sem of quadruplicate determinations at each concentration. the
percentage specific binding versus inhibitor concentration data were
fitted to a sigmoidal dose–response model with variable slope (“hill
slope”). ki values were calculated from the estimated ic50 values
using the cheng–prusoff correction, ki=ic50/(1+l*/kd), where l*
is the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  concentration used (1.3 nm) and kd was set to
the mean value from control saturation assays (0.81 nm). results
from the inhibition studies are summarized in table 4. dmi

discussion
kinetic studies
one of the main goals of this study was to characterize the
kinetics of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net and to use this
information in the design of saturation binding assays and
competitive inhibition studies. the measured value of koff,
0.0123 min−1, corresponds to a half-time (t0.5) of 56.3 min.
typically it is recommended that the incubation time used
in a saturation binding assay be set at five times the t0.5 of
radioligand dissociation (hulme and birdsall 1992). this
ensures that binding has reached at least 97% of the final
equilibrium values at all concentrations of radioligand
used in the assay. for [3h] xxxd2546xxx , this implies that an

incubation time of 282 min would be necessary to meet
this criteria. however, we chose to use a shorter incubation
time of 90 min in our saturation binding assays since we
were mainly interested in measuring cardiac net density
(bmax) rather than the affinity of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to
net (kd). the use of a shorter-than-ideal incubation time
causes the measured values of kd to be biased slightly
higher than the true equilibrium dissociation constant,
because binding at the lowest [3h] xxxd2546xxx  concentrations
does not reach >97% of equilibrium values. for our
purposes, the resulting small bias in measured kd values
was an acceptable trade-off for a shorter incubation time,
since this minimizes possible losses of net to degradation
during the assay.
similarly, for competition binding assays, it is recommended that the incubation time be set to five times the t0.5
of the slowest dissociation process in the assay (hulme
and birdsall 1992). since all of the net inhibitors and
substrates we studied have affinities for net lower than
[3h] xxxd2546xxx , we assumed that the dissociation rate of
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  was the slowest for all competition studies.
this again would indicate that an incubation time of
282 min would be best for these studies. however, we
used a shorter incubation time of 180 min, based partly on
the fact that for the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  concentrations used in
these studies (1.0–1.6 nm), equilibrium is effectively

reached within 90 min in the absence of a competing
ligand. while the presence of a competing ligand can
increase the time necessary to reach equilibrium, calculations using the equations for two competing ligands
binding simultaneously to a single binding site showed
that an incubation time of 180 min was sufficient for all
measured specific [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to be considered
at equilibrium values, within experimental measurement
errors. the rate of dissociation of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  from net
is slow enough for filtration to be used as the method for
separating free and bound radioligand. the filtration and
rinsing process took less than 90 s to complete, thus losses
of transporter-ligand complex during filtration were <2%.
saturation binding assays
the mean bmax value measured in control saturation
binding assays using rat heart net (461±58 fmol/mg
protein) appears to be somewhat higher than previously
reported values for male sprague–dawley rats. raisman et
al. measured net densities of 184±13 fmol/mg protein
using [3h]desipramine as the radioligand (raisman et al.
1982). böhm and coworkers reported values of ∼72 fmol/
mg protein in left ventricular samples and ∼112 fmol/mg
protein in right ventricular samples using [3h]nisoxetine
(böhm et al. 1998). kiyono et al. found bmax values of 206
±13 fmol/mg protein in the left ventricle anterior wall and
247±14 fmol/mg protein in the inferior wall, using [3h]
desipramine (kiyono et al. 2002b). for comparison,
several groups have reported cardiac net densities in
male wistar rats. ungerer et al. found cardiac net bmax
values of 125±4 fmol/mg protein using [3h] xxxd2546xxx 
(ungerer et al. 1996). leineweber et al. reported
comparable values of 123.0±7.7 fmol/mg protein in left
ventricle samples and 125.9±9.1 fmol/mg protein in right
ventricle samples using [3h]nisoxetine (leineweber et al.
2000). kiyono and coworkers measured net densities of
364±28 fmol/mg protein in left ventricle anterior wall and
459±36 fmol/mg protein in inferior wall using [3h]
desipramine (kiyono et al. 2002a). finally, mardon et al.
recently reported left ventricular bmax values of 488
±40 fmol/mg protein using crude tissue homogenates and
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  (mardon et al. 2003).
in the assay reproducibility studies in which the
resuspended p2 or p3 fractions were combined to achieve
a uniform net density in the membrane preparation
(group ii, table 1), the measured bmax values were
comparable to the control studies. however, bmax values
were grouped much more tightly than in the control
studies. this indicates that the binding assay itself is
highly reproducible and suggests that much of the

15

variability in the measured bmax values in the control
studies is due to animal-to-animal variation in cardiac
net density.
for the studies in which two different amounts of
membrane preparation were used (group iii, table 1), we
found similar binding parameters but the values for 50 mug
protein/well had higher coefficients of variation than the
values measured using 100 mug protein/well. this is most
likely due to the lower counting statistics obtained with the
lower protein concentration.
increasing the nacl concentration in the assay buffer
from 100 mm to 300 mm caused modest increases in bmax
and increased binding affinity more than twofold in rat
heart saturation assays (group iv, table 1). binding of
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  to net is dependent on the presence of both
sodium and chloride in the buffer, and increasing the nacl
concentration increases affinity by slowing the rate of
ligand dissociation from the transporter (javitch et al.
1984). similar results have been reported in studies of [3h]
desipramine binding to net from rat pheochromocytoma
cells (bönisch and harder 1986) and from bovine
adrenomedullary plasma membranes (michael-hepp et
al. 1992).
 xxxg2148xxx  density was found to be
higher in canine hearts than in rat hearts (table 2). also,
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  exhibited a lower binding affinity for net
from canine heart. in similar binding assays using [3h]
 xxxd2546xxx , net bmax values of 601±46 fmol/mg protein in
canine left ventricles have been reported (liang et al.
1989). increasing the nacl concentration in the assay
buffer had the same effect seen in related rat heart studies,
causing a small increase in net bmax but a pronounced
increase in binding affinity.
in rabbit hearts, net density was lower than in rat
hearts and [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding affinity was lower than
was seen in both rat and dog heart (table 3). rabbit heart
left ventricular net densities of ∼140 fmol/mg protein
(kawai et al. 2000) and ∼350 fmol/mg protein (shite et al.
2001) have previously been measured using [3h]nisoxetine.
böhm et al. reported cardiac net densities in nonfailing human heart of 1,102±37 fmol/mg protein using
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  in saturation binding assays (böhm et al.
1995). taking data from the present study together with
values from the literature, it appears that net density in
mammalian hearts follows the rank order human > dog >
rat > rabbit.
the specificity of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to net
associated with sympathetic neurons was verified in the
6-ohda studies (fig. 3). these findings also demonstrate
that the extensive damage inflicted on cardiac sympathetic
nerve terminals by high doses of 6-ohda (thoenen and
tranzer 1968; de champlain 1971) includes the obliteration of net proteins.

inhibition studies
the rank order of the measured ki values for the net
inhibitors and substrates studied in the competitive
inhibition studies are consistent with previously reported
values (bönisch and harder 1986; michael-hepp et al.
1992; tatsumi et al. 1997). the monophasic and complete
inhibition of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding by all of the net
inhibitors and substrates studied again verifies that the
radioligand binds exclusively to net in the rat heart
membrane preparation.
the sympathetic nerve imaging agent meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mibg) had ten-fold higher affinity for the
transporter than norepinephrine. another substrate used
for pet imaging of cardiac sympathetic innervation, metahydroxyephedrine (hed), had affinity for net comparable to norepinephrine. high affinity for net is a
desirable property for an imaging agent since it allows
the radiotracer to compete favorably with endogenous
norepinephrine for available transporters. this can be
particularly important in conditions such as congestive
heart failure where circulating levels of catecholamines
can be highly elevated (cohn et al. 1984). however, the
neuronal uptake rate of a radiolabeled net substrate used
as a cardiac sympathetic nerve radiotracer is dictated not
by its binding affinity (kd), but rather by the ratio of its
michaelis–menten transport parameters, vmax/km. the
relationship between kd, km and vmax for net substrates
has previously been studied by schömig and coworkers
using rat pheochromocytoma (pc12) cells (schömig et al.
1988).
comments on assay techniques
a few comments on technical aspects of implementing this
assay are warranted. the use of a cell harvester for
filtration is recommended since it provides highly
reproducible results. use of the corning costar nonbinding 96-well plates also contributed to assay reproducibility. [3h] xxxd2546xxx  is a very lipophilic compound
(log p>5) and tends to stick to the microplate wells. using
cotton-tipped swabs dipped in ethanol to rinse out residual
activity in the microplate wells after completing an assay,
approximately 10- to 30-fold less [3h] xxxd2546xxx  was
bound to the wells in the costar non-binding plates
when compared to standard polystyrene plates. regarding
the choice of radioligand for an net assay, based on
literature reports there does not appear to be a strong
advantage of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  over [3h]desipramine or [3h]
nisoxetine. [3h] xxxd2546xxx  was chosen for the present study
primarily because of the previously documented successes
of using this radioligand for quantifying cardiac net
density (liang et al. 1989; böhm et al. 1995; ungerer et al.
1996). also, technical data from perkin elmer/new
england nuclear states that [3h] xxxd2546xxx  is very stable
when stored at −20°c, with a decomposition rate of <1.5%
at 6 months after purification. for comparison, [3h]

16

desipramine decomposition is ∼3% at 3 months after
purification.

summary/conclusion
in conclusion, we have characterized the association and
dissociation kinetics of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to rat heart
net. [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding in rat heart membrane
preparations was found to be highly specific for net.
results from saturation binding assays demonstrated the
utility of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  as a radioligand for measuring
cardiac net density in mammalian heart samples. finally,
competitive binding assays with [3h] xxxd2546xxx  were an
effective tool for measuring the binding affinities of a wide
range of net inhibitors and substrates. the results of
these studies should be helpful to others interested in
implementing net assays as part of their research on
cardiac sympathetic innervation.
