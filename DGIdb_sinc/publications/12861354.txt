 xxxd2509xxx  etabonate: a soft steroid for the treatment of allergic diseases of the airways.  there are several approaches for developing new antiallergic/antiasthmatic agents. one of them is the improvement of an existing class of effective drug classes. due to some undesired effects of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids, there is a need for better tolerated corticosteroids.  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate belongs to the so-called class of soft steroids because it is metabolized by a one-step reaction (hydrolysis) without using the  xxxg578xxx  system. in in vitro investigations using human cells,  xxxd2509xxx  inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tnf-alpha, gm-csf, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ) according to its relative binding potency to the  xxxg1601xxx . in in vivo animal studies,  xxxd2509xxx  effectively inhibited allergically induced vascular leakage in the nasal cavity of actively sensitized brown norway rats and rhinorrhea in actively sensitized domestic pigs following nasal challenge. in several models of allergic asthma, it was clearly demonstrated that  xxxd2509xxx  was able to suppress the allergically induced late phase eosinophilia in mice, rats and guinea pigs. after intrapulmonary administration of  xxxd2509xxx , only a slight, statistically nonsignificant reduction in thymus weight was observed in a dose range far less than the therapeutically relevant doses. its therapeutic ratio is clearly superior to those of beclomethasone and budesonide.  xxxd2509xxx  is a safe steroid with an extremely wide range between therapeutic and side effect inducing doses. its elimination profile, its pronounced binding to plasma protein and erythrocytes and the low oral bioavailability makes this drug highly suitable for nasal or pulmonary use.
