key words:  xxxd2041xxx :  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate: map: repetitive sequence: microtubule-binding domain
 xxxd2041xxx -phosphate (emp), a phosphorylated conjugate of estradiol and nor-nitrogen mustard binds to microtubule-associated proteins  xxxg1360xxx  and tau. it was shown that this  xxxd2041xxx  derivative inhibits the binding of the c-terminal tubulin
peptide/3-(422-434) to both  xxxg1360xxx  and tau. this tubulin segment constitutes a main binding domain for these microtubule-associated proteins. interestingly,  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate interacted with the synthetic tau peptides v~at-g3u and v2~s- xxxg235xxx ,
representing two major repeats within the conserved microtubule-binding domain on tau and also on  xxxg1360xxx . this observation
was corroborated by the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate on the tau peptide-induced tubulin assembly into
microtubules, on the other hand, the nonphosphorylated drug cslramustine failed to block the map peptide-induced assembly,
indicating that the negatively charged phosphate moiety of  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate is of importance for its inhibitory effecl.
these findings suggest that the molecular sites for the action of estramustinc-phosphate are located within the microtubule
binding domains on tau and  xxxg1360xxx .

introduction

the multiple functions of microtubules, namety
modulation of cell shape, organelle transport, protein
secretion and mitosis appear to be mediated by at least
two main protein systems: the cytosolic motors involved
in many transport processes and the microtubule-associated proteins (maps) [1]. maps play essential cellular" roles regulating the assembly of microtubules and
stabilizing its structure [2-4]. current evidence point to
the involvement of these proteins in modulating the
interactions between microtubules with other filamentous components of the cytoskeleton [5,6]. maps are
proteins with a low level of molecular conformation [7]
that contain a microtubule-binding domain which interacts with the c-terminal moieties in tubulin subunits
[8-10] and a side domain which appears to be involved
in their interactions with other cellular protein or with
the microtubular surface [l 1,12].

abbreviations: em.  xxxd2041xxx ; emp.  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate:

sequence data derived from cdna clones revealed
the existence of a tandem of common repeats located
in the conserved region within the c-terminal one-third
moiety of  xxxg1360xxx  and tau [13,14]. recent studies point
to the involvement of these repetitive sequences in the
productive interaction of  xxxg1360xxx  and tau with the
microtubule system [15-17]. common antigenic determinants at the level of these repeats in  xxxg1360xxx  and tau
have been demonstrated using site-directed antibodies
[18]. on the other hand, maps interact with specific
binding sites within both the constant and variable
c-terminal subdomains of tubulin isoforms [10,19]. the
interaction of  xxxg1360xxx  and tau with tubulin appears to
be mediated by the binding of some of these repetitive
sequences with the segment //4422-434) within the
conserved region of fl-tubulin isotypes [20-22]. however, the high-molecular-weight components of map-i
appear to interact with an acidic moiety within the
variable domains of the distinct isoforms of fl-tubulin
[10,19,23].
 xxxd2041xxx  (em) is an adduct of estradiol and
nor-nitrogen mustard, which has been shown to arrest
mitosis [24] and it has proven to be effective in the
treatment of prostatic carcinoma [25]. the drug appears to interact with maps [26,27]. on the other
hand, previous studies have shown that the phospho-

98
rylated derivative  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate (emp)
blocks microtubule assembly and that this effect is
mediated by the drug interaction with  xxxg1360xxx  and tau
[28,29]. despite information that has been gained on
the mechanisms of action of the drug on protein secretions mediated by maps, and its anti-neoplasic action
[30-33], there is no information on the structural aspects of the em and emp binding domains on maps.
it has previously been shown that emp interacts with
the tubulin binding fragment of  xxxg1360xxx  [29]. we have
therefore focused our studies on  xxxg1360xxx  and tau domains for the interaction of emp, using assembly analysis combined with studies on the binding of the drug
to synthetic map peptides, and the effects of the emp
derivative on the interaction of c-terminal tubulin
fragments with maps. our studies demonstrate that
emp interacts specifically with the microtubule-binding domains, represented by the repetitive segments on
 xxxg1360xxx  and tau.
material and methods

materials
sucrose, dimethylsulfoxide, gtp type ii-s, egta
and the proteinase inhibitors pmsf, aprotinin and
soybean  xxxd207xxx  were from sigma. sephacryl
types s-200 and s-300 were obtained from pharmacia,
and biogei p-6 was from bio-rad. phosphocellulose
was obtained from whatman. the drugs, em and
emp and their tritiated radiolabeled derivatives were
generously provided by kabi pharmacia ab (sweden).

protein purification
tubulin was purified by cycles of assembly-disassembly [34] followed by phosphocellulose chromatography
[9]. for that purpose, microtubule protein was isolated
from bovine brain by three temperature-dependent
cycles of assembly and disassembly [9,34] and the microtubule pellets were resuspended in 0.02 m mes (ph
6.5), 0.5 mm mgci 2, 2 mm egta and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer pc) prior to the chromatographic step.
tubulin was separated from maps components by
phosphocellulose chromatography [9]. this tubulin
preparation (pc-tubulin) was used in all the experiments where purified tubulin was required.  xxxg1360xxx 
and tau were isolated as described by vera et al. [35].

peptide synthesis
the tau peptides v t~7-g2°4: vrskigstenlkhq-

pggg, vzla- xxxg235xxx : vtskcgslgnihhkpggg, and
v25°- xxxg267xxx : vqskigsldnithvpggg were synthesized on an automatic solid-phase peptide synthesizer
(type 430a, applied biosystems) and purified by reverse-phase hplc on a novopack c-18 column, with a
waters 501 apparatus. the purified peptides were sub-

jected to lyophilization and dissolved in buffer pc for
the different experiments described below.

polymerization assay
phosphocellulose-purified bovine brain tubulin (1.8
mg/ml) was adjusted to 0.i m mes (ph 6.8), 0.5 mm
mg ~+, 2 mm egta (buffer a) in the presence of the
0.16 mm of either tau peptides, and in the presence or
absence of increasing concentrations of emp. aliquots
of a fresh stock solution of emp prepared i~ buffer a
were added to 0.4 ml of assembly mixture in order to
give the final concentrations indicated in fig. 3. in the
experiments using the non-phosphorylated derivative
em, the drug was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and
4-10/~i aliquots were added to 0.4 ml assembly mixture to give the final concentrations indicated in fig. 6.
equivalent amounts of pure dimethylsulfoxide were
added to controls assayed in the absence of the drug.
after 3 min preincubation of the assembly mixture at
30°c either in the absence or the presence of the
respective drugs, 1 mm gtp was added to the assembly system and tubulin assembly was assayed turbidimetrically [36], or using the sedimentation procedure
as described by cross et al. [10].

electron microscopy
samples were obtained from the assembly mixture
(both before and after the assembly mixture was subjected to cold reversibility of the assembly products),
fixed in warm buffer a containing 1 mm gtp, stained
with uranyl acetate and observed in a philips 300
electron microscope [22].

binding studies
(a) ultracentrifugation method. binding of the 3hacetylated tubulin peptide /3-11(422-434) to  xxxg1360xxx 
under non-assembly conditions was quantitated by ultracentrifugation in a beckman airfuge, using sucrose
to provide density stabilization [37]. centrifugation was
carried out for 3 h. at room temperature at 140000 x g
on solutions containing 1.8 m g / m l  xxxg1360xxx  and the
desired concentration of tubulin peptide admixed with
tracer amounts of 3h-acetylated /]-11(422-434) peptide. under these conditions more than 99% of  xxxg1360xxx 
sedimented out of the 10 tzl aliquot removed from the
top of the sedimentation column, while blanks containing no  xxxg1360xxx  were allowed to introduce corrections
for the small amount (around 3%) of unbound peptide
sedimented during ultracentrifugation.
(b) small zone gel chromatography. the experimental conditions were those of maccioni et al. [20]. a
mixture of purified  xxxg1360xxx  (1.8 mg/ml) and stoichiometric amounts of the 3h-acetylated/3-tubulin peptide
(sp. act = 1200 cpm/nmol) in a final vol. of 0.42 mi was
incubated at 30°c for 16 rain followed by chromatographic separation in a sephacryl s-200 column (1.0 x

28 cm) equilibrated in 0.05 m mes (ph 6.8), 1 mm
mgci z. the column flow was maintained at 5.8- 10 -3
cm 3 s-~ and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. other
experimental details are indicated in the respective
figure legend.

direct interaction of/sh/ xxxd2041xxx -p with tau peptides
tau p e p t i d e s vlat-g 2°4, v21a- xxxg23xxx ~' or v25°- xxxg267xxx 
were incubated for 10 rain at 27°c either in the absence of emp (control) or with 10-20/~m emp in the
presence of tracer amounts of the 3h-labeled drug, and
the mixtures subjected to zonal chromatography in a
column of biogel p-6. fractions of 0.35 ml were collected. the peptide concentrations in each separated
fraction were determined by the fluoreseamine method
and the radioactivity associated to the tritiated emp
was determined by scintillatior: counting.
results

current information points to the roles of protein
binding domains involved in the specific macromolecular interactions between tau (or  xxxg1360xxx ) and the tubulin molecule [2,8-10,15,16]. a schematic representation
of the main sequences of the ~-ii(422-434) segment
within the c-terminal moiety ot /]-tubulin and three
repetitive sequences derived from the immature tau
are shown below.
the c-terminal /]-tubulin sequence constitutes part
of the tubulin domain for the binding of  xxxg1360xxx  and
tau [20]. on the other hand, it has been shown that the
repetitive tau sequences, which are also present in
 xxxg1360xxx  [ 13,14] constitute microtubule binding domains.
certain isoforms of the adult brain tau contain these
repeats while other isotypes contain an additional
fourth repetitive sequence [13-16]. we used synthetic
peptides corresponding to those sequences [15] to analyze the effects of emp in interfering with the tubulinmap interactions, and at the level of the assembly
system. thus, we focused on the functional domains on
 xxxg1360xxx  and tau; e.g., map domains that recognize
tubulin and their possible role in the interactions of
emp. binding studies in the airfuge, using variable

admixed with tracer amounts of the 3h-acetylated peptide and a fixed concentration of  xxxg1360xxx  [20,38], were

double reciprocal plots of fig. 1 showed that the
increase in tubulin peptide concentration [cfl(422434)] correlates with an increase in its binding to
 xxxg1360xxx  (v, moles of tubulin peptide bound per mole of
 xxxg1360xxx ). however, at the same concentration of tubulin peptide, binding decreased in the presence of emp,
indicating a competitive inhibition by the drug on the
interaction between the 3h-acetylated /]-11(422-434)
tubulin peptide and  xxxg1360xxx . the interaction was also
analyzed by small zone gel filtration on sephacryl
s-200. complex formation between  xxxg1360xxx  and the
[3h]-/]-11(422-434) was demonstrated, in agreement
with preliminary observations, as evidenced by the bimodal elution profiles of total labeled peptide displayed in fig. 2. a significant decrease in the first peak

the presence of 10/lm emp. as controls, no radioactivity was observed at the elution volume of  xxxg1360xxx 
when the labeled peptide was chromatographed alone
in the absence of  xxxg1360xxx , and no complex formation
was observed between the tubulin peptide and non-microtubular proteins such as myosin and bovine serum
albumin.

it has been reported that 18 amino acid synthetic
peptides containing the microtubule-binding repeated
sequences on  xxxg1360xxx  and tau induce tubulin assemb;y
in a cold-reversible fashion [15,17]. this assembly is
mediated by the direct interaction of the synthetic
map peptides with specific c-terminal domains on
tubulin [10,15]. thus, in order to shed light into the
map functional domains recognized by emp, the effects of the drug on tubulin assembly induced by peptides vi87-g 2°4 and v21lg z35 were analyzed. fig. 3
shows the assembly kinetics of tubulin induced by the
first tau peptide, and the inhibition exerted by increasing concentrations of emp. it is worth pointing out
that the first two tau peptides induce tubulin assembly
with a linear concentration-dependence fashion even
at peptide/tubulin molar ratios of 12:1 [15], and that
tau peptide concentrations used in these experiments
were within linearity. the drug decreased the rate of
peptide-induced assembly and the extent of microtubule polymerization as shown in the insert of fig. 3.
an increase in the constituent concentration of emp
resulted in a gradual inhibition of the level of assembly
reached at plateau. interestingly, an inhibition of
around 50% in tau peptide-induced assembly was attained  xxxd1891xxx  #zm emp, a level of drug concentration
which produced a blockage in the binding of the ,811(422-434) regulatory tubulin peptide to  xxxg1360xxx .

tcractions. in this experiment the tritiated drug was
preincubated with tau peptide v d~-g~4 and subjected
to zonal filtration chromatography on a biogel p-6
column. a fraction of bound emp co-eluted with the
tau peptide at the clution volume corresponding to the
peptide, and a large fraction of the unbound labeled
drug eluted with a v~ corresponding to the internal
volume of the column (fig. 5a). these data suggest the
formation of a complex between emp and the first tau
fragment. interestingly, an additional peptide peak
eluting at v0 resulted after preincubation of the tau
fragment with emp, since this peak was not observed
when the free peptide was subjected to chromatography. the fractions of this peak contained aggregate
forms of the tau peptide, possibly oligomers of higher
size than the free synthetic peptide. the labeled drug
also co-eluted with the apparently aggregated fraction
of tau peptide (fig. 5a). a similar elation pattern was
obtained after chromatography of the second tau peptide vzls-g !~'s, incubated with tritiated emp (fig. 5b).
studies with the tau peptide v zstlg267 did not show
interaction of emp with this third tau repeat, pcptidc
which has been also shown to have a a poor effect on
inducing tubulin assembly [15,17].
it is worth pointing out that several experiments
using the original non-phosphorylated drug em revealed that free [ah] xxxd2041xxx  does not interact at
all with either tau peptide (data not shown). this
observation was corroborated by experiments on the

102
effect of em on map-induced microtubule assembly.
actually, when em was assayed on the system in which
tubulin assembly is induced by the tau peptide it failed
to produce inhibition of polymerization and to disassemble preformed microtubules. this drug has been
shown to interact with map-l and  xxxg1360xxx  [26,27], and
did not inhibit formation of microtubules induced by
the peptide vislg tm (fig. 6a). furthermore, em did
not affect at all the minimal concentration for the
assembly (fig. 6b). furthermore, extrapolation to the
polymer coordinate in the plot of fig. 6b [40] indicate
that there is no significant change in the critical concentration (cr) for tau-peptide-induced assembly in the
presence of em.
discussion

the studies were oriented to elucidate the  xxxd2041xxx -phosphate binding domains on  xxxg1360xxx  and tau.
on the basis of recent information on the functional
sites involved in the protein interactions between tubulin and maps, we analyzed the effects of the drug on
the binding of the synthetic tubulin peptide fl-ii(422434) to  xxxg1360xxx . ]t is evident from the airfuge binding
experiment of fig. l, and the comparison of the elution
profiles obtained after zonal chromatography in the
absence and the presence of emp, that the drug interferes with the interaction between the site-specific
tubulin peptide and  xxxg1360xxx . small zone chromatography has proven to be a useful approach to analyze
the interaction of tubulin fragments with different
maps [20,38]. furthermore, the double reciprocal plot
derived from the statistical binding of /3-11(422-434),
indicates that emp competes with the tubulin fragment for the binding to the microtubule-associatedprotein  xxxg1360xxx . these studies suggest the interaction
of emp with a domain on  xxxg1360xxx  responsible for its
binding to tubulin.
another line of studies indicated that map-tubulin
interaction is mediated by both electrostatic and conformational effects, and that a cationic moiety present
in  xxxg1360xxx  and tau interacts with amino acid residues
within the c-terminal domain of tubulin isoforms
[10,4i]. thus, it is likely that emp may interact with
basic amino acid residues in the cationic segment of
the tubulin binding domain on  xxxg1360xxx , and possibly on
tau. in addition, previous studies demonstrated the
interaction of emp with the native tau protein and the
tubulin binding fragment on  xxxg1360xxx  [29,42].
1-herefore, the effect of emp on tubulin assembly
driven by tau peptides containing the repetitive sequences was analyzed. these peptides define sequences that also exist on  xxxg1360xxx  binding domains
[13-16,43]. the data shows that the drug interferes
with peptide-induced microtubule assembly, an effect
which may be mediated by emp interference with the

productive interaction between tau peptides and tubulin leading to polymer assembly. it has been shown that
the action of tau peptides in inducing tubulin assembly
follows a linear dependence with the peptide concentration [15], and that stoichiometrically higher amounts
of tau peptide in respect to tubulin were required to
reach a significant level of polymerization. the effects
of emp at coidcentrations below those used for tau
peptide to induce assembly may reflect the binding of
emp to several molecules of the same tau peptide
sequence, possibly by inducing aggregation as evidenced from fig. 5. the results on the assembly experiments were thus confirmed at the level of electron
microscopy, where filamentous structures and incomplete microtubules were observed after assembly in the
presence of emp. since emp does not interact with
tubulin [29], the results strongly suggest that emp
could interac: with map domains at the level of these
repetitive sequences. further demonstration of this
hypothesis was obtained from the bio-gel p-6 zonal
chromatographic experiments of fig. 6 which indicate a
direct interaction between emp and the peptides containing the first two .~,cquences found in the repeated
tandem wi*.hin the conserved regions in both tau and
 xxxg1360xxx  [ 13-15].
on the other hand,  xxxd2041xxx , the non-phosphorylated conjugate of estradiol and nor-nitrogen mustard, failed to inhibit tau peptide-induced tubulin assembly. in addition, em did not affect prcassembied
microtubules. these findings agree with previous observations on a lesser specificity of the interaction of
em with microtubular components as compared with
emp [29]. the phosphorylated drug emp interacts
with at least two sites on tau [39] and with 5-6 sites on
 xxxg1360xxx  with a dissociation constant of 20 /.tm [42].
however, it has been reported that the non-phosphorylated drug em binds mainly to the high-molecularweight components map-i and  xxxg1360xxx  [26]. these
observations taken together with the findings on the
interactiot~ of the emp derivative with the repetitive
domain on  xxxg1360xxx , suggest that em and emp may
bind to different domains on maps. the present data
also suggest that the the negatively charged phosphate
moiety could be critical for the selective interaction of
emp with the functional domain on maps. this information however, does not allow predictions on the
possible sites on maps for em interaction. the molecular nature of this drug suggests that a hydrophobic
domain on maps rather than the cationic
microtubule-binding moiety might be involved in the
interaction of em with maps. thus, the phosphate
moiety of emp seems to be of importance for its
maps-dependent effect, since only negatively charged
estradiol-mustard derivatives have such an effect, suggesting the functional role of a negatively charged
