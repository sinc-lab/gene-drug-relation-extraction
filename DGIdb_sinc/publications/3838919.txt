effects of  xxxd3435xxx  in patients with prosthetic heart valves.  the biological effects of a new antiplatelet agent,  xxxd3435xxx , were evaluated in patients with cardiac valvular prostheses. each patient received 900 mg/day of oral  xxxd3435xxx  for 30 days.  xxxd3435xxx  significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by  xxxd80xxx  (1 to 5 mumol) or epinephrine (12.5 mumol), showing a slight effect on bleeding time (basal: 6 +/- 1.7 min; 30 days of treatment: 8.0 +/- 2.7 min). serum levels of thromboxane b2 were significantly reduced during treatment, but changes in serum levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin f1 alpha were not observed, suggesting that  xxxd3435xxx  does not affect prostacyclin biosynthesis by the vascular wall. the results show that  xxxd3435xxx  has a marked inhibitory and selective effect on platelet function in patients with cardiac valvular prostheses.
