a novel variant l263f in human  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase 2 is associated with diminished enzyme activity.   xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase 2 is required for purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. variants in the  xxxg1187xxx  gene may account for the large inter-individual variability in baseline enzyme activity, immunosuppressive efficacy and side effects in transplant recipients receiving  xxxd2678xxx . therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and functionally characterize  xxxg1187xxx  variants.
