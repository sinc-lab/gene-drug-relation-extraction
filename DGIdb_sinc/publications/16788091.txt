abstract
the retinoid-related molecules (rrms) st1926 [(e)-3-(4⬘-hydroxy-3⬘-adamantylbiphenyl-4-yl)acrylic acid] and cd437 (6[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic
acid) are promising anticancer agents. we compared the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) trans-activating properties of the two
rrms and  xxxd3417xxx  (atra). st1926 and cd437
are better rar␥ agonists than atra. we used three teratocarcinoma cell lines to evaluate the significance of rar␥ in the
activity of rrms: f9-wild type (wt); f9␥⫺/⫺, lacking the rar␥
gene; f9␥51, a f9␥⫺/⫺ derivative, complemented for the rar␥
deficit. similar to atra, st1926 and cd437 activate cytodifferentiation only in f9-wt cells. unlike atra, st1926 and
cd437 arrest cells in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle and
induce apoptosis in all f9 cell lines. our data indicate that rar␥
and the classic retinoid pathway are not relevant for the antiproliferative and apoptotic activities of rrms in vitro. increases

in cytosolic calcium are fundamental for apoptosis, in that
intracellular calcium chelators abrogate the process. comparison of the gene expression profiles associated with st1926
and atra in f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ indicates that the rrm activates a conspicuous nonretinoid response in addition to the
classic and rar-dependent pathway. the pattern of genes
regulated by st1926 selectively, in a rar␥-independent manner, provides novel insights into the possible molecular determinants underlying the activity of rrms in vitro. furthermore, it
suggests that rar␥-dependent responses are relevant to the
activity of rrms in vivo. indeed, the receptor hinders the antitumor activity in vivo, in that both syngeneic and immunosuppressed scid mice bearing f9␥⫺/⫺ tumors have increased life
spans after treatment with st1926 and cd437 relative to their
f9-wt counterparts.

are promising antineoplastic agents (garattini and terao,
2004; garattini et al., 2004b). the activity of classic retinoids
is the consequence of selective antiproliferative and cytodifferentiating effects that are mediated predominantly by specific nuclear receptors of the rar and rxr families (altucci
and gronemeyer, 2001). in many cell types, classic retinoids

the overall antineoplastic activity of rrms. furthermore, the
use of f9 teratocarcinoma cells is likely to provide information as to the relevance of the classic rar/rxr and alternative or complementary pathways for the pharmacology of
rrms. finally, the availability of f9 teratocarcinoma cell
lines differing only in the expression of rar␥ (taneja et al.,
1997) represents a unique tool to study the significance of the
receptor for the antineoplastic activity of rrms. the growth
of f9 teratocarcinoma cells as solid tumors in syngenic
strains of animals is a further advantage, permitting in vivo
experiments.
in this study, three f9 teratocarcinoma cell lines with
different expression of rar␥ were used to investigate the
cytodifferentiating, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects of
st1926 and cd437 compared with atra. in the same system, using whole-genome microarrays, st1926 specific responses and their rar␥-dependence were defined. finally,
the involvement of rar␥ in the overall antitumor activity of
rrms was studied in normal and immunosuppressed mice
transplanted with f9 cells.

materials and methods
chemicals. atra and bapta were purchased from sigma (st.
louis, mo). fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2) was from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). st1926 and cd437 were synthesized by sigmatau industrie farmaceutiche riunite s.p.a. (pomezia, italy).
cell cultures and transfections. cos-7 (american type culture collection, manassas, va) and the f9 teratocarcinoma cell
lines, f9-wt, f9␥⫺/⫺, and f9␥51 (taneja et al., 1997), were grown
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf
serum and were free from mycoplasma. cos-7 cells were transfected
with human rar␣, rar␤, rar␥, or rxr␣ psg5-based plasmids
along with the  xxxg1057xxx -tk-cat (rar-dependent) or dr1-tk-cat (rxrdependent) reporter genes and the normalization plasmid pch110
(␤-galactosidase) (garattini et al., 2004a). transactivation assays on
the various isoforms of rar were performed using extracts of transfected cos-7 treated for 24 h with different concentrations of the test
retinoid, as described previously (garattini et al., 2004a)
cellular proliferation, viability, and apoptosis. cell number
and viability were determined after staining with erythrosin
(sigma). for the determination of the apoptotic index, adherent cells
were detached, fixed in methanol, and stained with 4,6 diamidino2-phenylindole (giannı̀ et al., 2000). the apoptotic index is the percentage of cells with features of nuclear fragmentation after counting
a minimum of 300 nuclei/field under the fluorescence microscope. in
some experiments, apoptosis was determined according to the annexin-v assay by flow cytometry (mebcyto apoptosis kit; mbl international, woburn, ma) (garattinı̀ et al., 2004a), using the flow
cytometer facscalibur (bd biosciences, palo alto, ca). caspase-3
activation was measured with the fluorogenic peptide substrate
devd-amc
(n-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin;
alexis, laufelingen, switzerland) (mologni et al., 1999).
flow cytometric cell cycle analysis. f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺
cells were counted using a coulter counter (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca) and fixed in 70% ethanol. cells (1–2 ⫻ 106) were washed
with pbs and stained with 1 ml of a solution containing 10 ␮g/ml
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) and 10,000 units of rnase overnight at 4°c in
the dark. flow cytometric analyses were performed using facscalibur, and the distribution of the cells in the different cell cycle phases
calculated by the gaussian method (ubezio, 1985).
rna preparation and rt-pcr. total rna was extracted according to the guanidinium-thiocyanate-cesium chloride method, reverse transcribed, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)

exert unique actions of oncological interest, including growth
inhibition, cytodifferentiation, and direct or indirect cytotoxicity. because the molecular mechanisms of action of retinoids are generally different from those of other antineoplastic
agents, there is growing interest in the synthesis of molecules with new properties (rishi et al., 2003; sabichi et al.,
2003; cao et al., 2004; chun et al., 2005).
a novel series of synthetic  xxxd3417xxx  derivatives [retinoid-related molecules (rrms) or atypical retinoids], with activity in leukemia and cancer cells, has been described recently (mologni et al., 1999; ponzanelli et al., 2000; sun et al.,
2002; zhang et al., 2002; garattini et al., 2004a; lopezhernandez et al., 2004; zuco et al., 2004). in certain cellular
contexts, these molecules do not show cross- resistance with
atra (marchetti et al., 1999) and other chemotherapeutics
(ponzanelli et al., 2000), suggesting novel features and mechanisms of action relative to classic retinoids and the available
anticancer agents. the prototypes of rrms are cd437 and
st1926 (garattini et al., 2004). cd437 is a retinoid originally
developed as a selective rar␥ agonist (delescluse et al.,
1991). although a preliminary report suggested that st1926
is not an efficient rar␥ agonist (cincinelli et al., 2003), we
have provided evidence that the compound does bind to and
trans-activate the receptor (garattini et al., 2004b). st1926
is a more powerful antileukemic and anticancer agent
(cincinelli et al., 2003; garattini et al., 2004a) with better
toxicologic and pharmacokinetic profiles than cd437.
st1926 is under preclinical development in view of phase i
clinical trials.
various aspects of the molecular mechanisms of action of
rrms remain unclear. from a structural standpoint, rrms
are classified as synthetic retinoids. however, the contribution of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors to the antineoplastic
activity of st1926 and cd437 is not completely defined. in
particular, involvement of rar␥ is debated (hsu et al., 1997;
holmes et al., 2000; sun et al., 2000a; zhao et al., 2001). in
certain cells, pharmacological inhibition of rar␥ blocks the
action of cd437 (holmes et al., 2000), whereas in others, this
is ineffective (mologni et al., 1999). synthesis of an active
rrm with strong apoptotic properties and no rar␥ binding
activity (dawson et al., 2001) adds to the controversy. furthermore, although the activity of st1926 and cd437 in
myeloid leukemia is predominantly the result of an apoptotic
process, rrms also inhibit growth and induce cytodifferentiation in other tumor contexts. these two further actions
may contribute to the overall antineoplastic activity of rrms
and have never been the object of a systematic study. finally,
the gene expression program set in motion by rrms and its
dependence on the activation of rar␥ or other rar isotypes
is unknown.
f9 teratocarcinoma cells represent a useful cell-autonomous model to study the activity of retinoids (boylan et al.,
1993; taneja et al., 1997; faria et al., 1999; rochette-egly et
al., 2000a,b; rochette-egly and chambon, 2001; zhuang et
al., 2003; bour et al., 2005). these cells undergo growth
arrest and differentiation along the primitive endoderm in
response to atra and other synthetic retinoids. moreover,
studies conducted with f9 sublines presenting genetic deletion of rar␥ (boylan et al., 1993) demonstrated that
endodermal differentiation requires activation of the receptor. thus, the f9 model is well suited to define the relative
contribution of cytodifferentiation and growth inhibition to

in vivo studies. f9-wt or f9␥⫺/⫺ cells (3 ⫻ 106) were inoculated intraperitoneally in 129/sv syngenic animals or in immunodeficient scid mice (charles river italia, calco, italy). st1926,
cd437, or atra was dissolved in a diluent consisting of cremophor/
ethanol (garattini et al., 2004a). all the compounds were administered i.p. or orally once per day for up to 3 weeks. body weight and
lethality were recorded every day. all the experiments were approved by the internal animal care committee and conducted according to the pertinent international and italian legislation.
gene microarrays. f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ were treated for 10 h
with vehicle (dmso),  xxxd3417xxx  (0.5 ␮m), or the synthetic retinoid st1926 (0.5 ␮m). the polyadenylated rna fraction
was isolated from total rna using magnetic oligo(dt) micro-spheres
(dynal as, oslo, norway). polyadenylated rna was amplified and
labeled with the fluorochrome cy3 or cy5 using the amino allyl
messageamp ii kit (ambion inc., austin, tx). each rna preparation represents a pool of four flasks treated independently with the
appropriate stimulus. each experimental sample consists of 1) a
replicate in which the control rna is labeled with cy3 and the
treated rna with cy5 and 2) a swapped replicate in which the
control rna is labeled with cy3 and the treated rna with cy5. an
equal amount of cy3- and cy5-labeled crnas were mixed and hybridized to the oligonucleotide microarray (agilent 60-mer microarray oligo processing protocol version 2.1; agilent technologies, palo
alto, ca). after washing, microarray glass slides were scanned with
the g2565aa dual laser scanner (agilent technologies). images
were analyzed with the feature extraction software version 7.1
(agilent technologies). dye normalization was performed automatically, using the rank consistency filter and the linearlowess
normalization method. the raw data of the microarray experiments

measurement of intracellular calcium. changes in intracellular calcium concentrations were measured at the single-cell level
in a semiquantitative fashion. in brief, f9-wt or f9␥⫺/⫺ cells were
seeded (300,000/ml) on microscopic glass slides and allowed to adhere overnight. cells were labeled with 4 ␮m fluo3-am (invitrogen)
at 37°c for 1 h. slides were washed twice with pbs and incubated in
pbs containing 1.26 mm cacl2. after addition of vehicle (dmso) or
st1926 (1 ␮m) the associated fluorescence was measured for a

gräfelfing, germany). for each experiment, cells were scanned for at
least 30 s to establish a baseline fluorescence reading before addition
of the appropriate stimulus. all incubations were carried out while
continuously scanning the cells every 200 ms.
for the quantitative determination of intracellular calcium in the

cos-7 cells (200,000/well) were transfected with expression vectors containing the indicated rar isoforms (0.1 ␮g), a  xxxg1057xxx -tk-reporter construct (1.0 ␮g) and pch110
normalizing vector containing bacterial ␤-galactosidase (0.5 ␮g). twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated for further 24 h with different concentrations of the
retinoid (0.0001–10 ␮m), using logarithmic dilutions. cat activity was measured in cell extracts and normalized for the level of transfection using ␤-galactosidase enzymatic
activity. the ec50 (the concentration giving 50% of the maximal transactivation effect) was obtained from appropriate dose-response curves run in duplicate and was
calculated with the prism version 4.0 software package (graphpad software, san diego, ca). receptor selectivity is calculated as the inverse ratio of the ec50s determined
for each couple of receptors. each value is the mean ⫹ sd of 3 independent transfection replicates. the maximal activity is relative to atra, whose transactivation effect
is taken as 100. this parameter is expressed as the % ratio of the cat activity measured for each compound (1 mm) and atra (1 mm) after transfection of the indicated

st1926 and cd437 were rar␥ activators. we compared the ability of st1926, cd437, and atra to activate
rar␣, rar␤, and rar␥ overexpressed in cos-7 cells (table
2). the ec50 reflects the affinity of each retinoid for the three
isoforms of rar. for rar␣ and rar␤, the rank order of
potency was atra ⫽ cd437 ⬎ st1926, whereas for rar␥, it
was cd437 ⬎ atra ⬎ st1926. rar selectivity was calculated as the inverse ratio of the ec50 values. the data obtained are consistent with previous results, indicating that
atra was a nonselective (pan-rar) agonist, whereas cd437
was a selective rar␥ agonist. in addition, our results demonstrated that st1926 bound and trans-activated the three
receptors with similar affinity and, unlike cd437, lacked
rar␥ selectivity. table 2 also shows the maximal activity of
each compound at saturating concentrations. it is noteworthy that both st1926 and cd437 activated rar␥ more efficiently than atra. cotransfection of rxr␣ did not change
the ec50 values of st1926, cd437, and atra for the various
isoforms of rar (data not shown). this is in line with the
concept that cos-7 cells contain significant amounts of native rxrs that combine with overexpressed rars to form
transcriptionally active rxr/rar heterodimers (garattini
et al., 2004b; giannı̀ et al., 2006).
st1926 and cd437 are unlikely to possess significant rxr
agonistic activity, as demonstrated by transfection of cos-7
cells with rxr␣ and an appropriate reporter gene activated
by rxr/rxr homodimers. under these experimental conditions, the rxr agonist 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) caused a

9.7 ⫾ 0.8 (mean ⫾ s.d., n ⫽ 3) induction of cat reporter
activity over the unliganded control sample. in contrast, the
effects of st1926 or cd437 were minimal, dose-independent,
and did not exceed a 2-fold induction at all the concentrations
investigated (0.01 ␮m-10 ␮m).
the f9 teratocarcinoma model. to define the relevance of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors, and rar␥ in particular, for the pharmacological activity of st1926 and cd437,
we chose the mouse f9 teratocarcinoma model. experiments
were performed on three clonal cell lines with different expression of rar␥. as shown in fig. 1a, wild-type f9 cells
(f9-wt) expressed rar␣ and rar␥ constitutively. as expected, rar␤ was not expressed under basal conditions.
ablation of the rar␥ gene by homologous recombination
results in an f9 subline (f9␥⫺/⫺), which maintains synthesis of rar␣ but has an absolute deficit of rar␥ (boylan et
al., 1993). rar␥ expression in the f9␥⫺/⫺ cellular background is partially reconstituted by transgenesis in f9␥51
cells (taneja et al., 1997).
figure 1b demonstrates that the proliferation curves of
f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cell lines in standard culture conditions
were very similar. furthermore, the growth of the two cell
types did not differ significantly from that determined for
rar␥51. finally, the morphology of the three lines growing
in basal conditions is indistinguishable (data not shown). the
similarities of f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells in vitro are recapitulated in vivo. figure 1c illustrates the growth characteristics and the morphology of the tumors derived from the
f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells in syngeneic 129/sv mice. the two
types of tumors grew as homogeneous solid masses in the
peritoneal cavity and had similar and highly undifferentiated cell morphology. the growth kinetics of the two tumors
were superimposable and resulted in masses of similar
weight and volume. the median survival times of animals
inoculated with f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells did not differ significantly and were 14.3 ⫾ 3.2 and 13.0 ⫾ 3.1 days (mean ⫾
sd of three independent experiments), respectively. all together, our results indicate that rar␥ expression had no
influence on the in vitro or in vivo growth and morphology of

rar␥ and retinoid-related molecules

untreated f9 cells. these features support the relevance of
the model for our comparative studies on rrms and atra.
st1926 and cd437, like atra, induce f9 cytodifferentiation via rar␥. to study cytodifferentiation, we
compared the ability of atra, st1926, and cd437 to induce
the expression of the mrnas coding for two validated markers of the primitive endoderm, collagen iv and laminin b in
f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ (fig. 2a). as expected, the synthesis of
the collagen iv and laminin b transcripts was induced in
f9-wt cells treated with atra (0.1 ␮m) for 48 h but not in

the f9␥⫺/⫺ counterpart. both st1926 and cd437 (0.1 ␮m)
were at least as effective as atra in inducing the two
marker mrnas; once again, this phenomenon was evident
only in the f9-wt cell line. hence, under the experimental
conditions considered, the two rrms acted as classic retinoids and induced primitive endodermal differentiation in a
rar␥-dependent mode. our results are consistent with the
fact that rar␥ expression is necessary for the retinoid-dependent differentiation of f9 into primitive endodermal cells
(boylan et al., 1993; plassat et al., 2000). more importantly,
they demonstrate that st1926 and cd437 activated rar␥ in
a natural cellular context and behaved like classic retinoids
at the concentration considered.
st1926 and cd437 induce growth arrest and cell
death via a rar␥-independent mechanism. we evaluated whether the rar␥-dependent cytodifferentiation induced by the two rrms was accompanied by growth inhibition. as documented by fig. 2b, the action of st1926 and
cd437 could be divided in two phases. in fact, within the first
48 h, both compounds blocked the growth of f9-wt and
f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. at first, growth inhibition was not accompanied by a loss in cell viability, which was always above 80%,
as observed in the case of control cultures (data not shown).
after 2 days of treatment, a progressive and similar decrease
in viability was evident in both cell lines. contrary to what
was observed in the case of the two rrms, equimolar concentrations of atra induced only a delay in the growth of
f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells and no significant cytotoxicity at
any of the time points considered. as shown in fig. 2c,
increasing the concentration of st1926 and cd437 to 2 ␮m
caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of viable
cells already evident at 48 h. in these conditions, st1926 and
cd437 reduced the viability of f9-wt cells from 88 ⫾ 1%
(mean ⫾ s.d., n ⫽ 3) to 66 ⫾ 2 and 63 ⫾ 6 at 0.5 ␮m, 29 ⫾
4% and 41 ⫾ 10% at 1 ␮m, as well as 12 ⫾ 4% and 6 ⫾ 2% at
2 ␮m. even at these relatively high concentrations, the cytotoxic effect of the two compounds did not correlate with
rar␥ expression. in fact, not only f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells
but also f9␥51 cells showed very similar responses to the
cytotoxic action of st1926 and cd437. it is noteworthy that
even the highest concentrations of atra (1 and 2 ␮m),
though producing a growth inhibitory effect (fig. 2c), continued to be devoid of significant cytotoxic activity on any of
the cell lines considered. in fact in all cases, cell viability did
not differ significantly from control conditions (data not
shown). overall, our results indicate that, in the case of both
the rrms and atra, growth inhibition was dissociated from
the induced cytodifferentiating action. more importantly,
they demonstrate that the observed growth inhibitory effects
of st1926 or cd437 and atra were intrinsically different.
atra showed a pure antiproliferative action, whereas the
activity of the other two compounds on f9 cell growth involved both an antiproliferative and a cytotoxic component.
st1926 and cd437 induce a g2/m arrest of the cell
cycle. the cell cycle perturbations afforded by low concentrations (0.1 ␮m) of the two rrms and atra were determined within the first 24 h of treatment. these experimental
conditions were designed to avoid interferences caused by
cytotoxicity. figure 3 shows facs profiles, along with the
corresponding quantitative results, of f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺

the appearance of early apoptotic markers, such as  xxxg166xxx  binding to the plasma membrane (fig. 4b) and

of early and late apoptotic cells, leaving the number of
necrotic cells basically unaltered. this was mirrored by a
proportional decrease in the number of viable cells in
st1926 treated f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cultures. exposure of
f9␥⫺/⫺ and f9-wt cells to 0.5 ␮m st1926 or cd437 for

marker, caspase-3, as measured by hydrolysis of the

st1926 and cd437 was similar in both f9 lines. the two
compounds caused a rapid depletion of the g1 compartment
that was already evident at 12 h. this was accompanied by
an expansion of the s and/or g2/m phase. the results obtained with atra were significantly different. despite a
slowed progression along the cell cycle, indicated by an increase in the s phase at 24 h, atra caused no accumulation
in g2/m in either f9-wt or f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. the expected
accumulation in g1, as demonstrated in previous reports (li
et al., 2004), was observed at later time points (3–4 days,
data not shown). it was clear that st1926/cd437 and atra
blocked the cells in two distinct phases of the cycle, demonstrating that the cellular mechanisms activated were different. thus, our results support the concept that a classic
retinoid dependent response was not at the basis of the early
growth arrest afforded by rrms.
st1926 and cd437 were characterized by an apoptotic action that did not require rar␥. as shown
in fig. 4a, treatment of f9-wt, f9␥⫺/⫺, and f9␥51 cells
with st1926 for 24 h induced morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and

rar␥ and retinoid-related molecules

the time dependence values for the elevation of fura-2 fluorescence induced by st1926 and cd437 in the two cell lines are
very similar. at equimolar concentrations, atra (fig. 5b,
right) and inactive st1926 congeners (data not shown) exerted
no significant action on calcium homeostasis. our data demonstrate that rrms induced a rapid and long-lasting elevation of
cytosolic calcium that is independent of the adherence to an
extracellular substratum. furthermore, they suggest that calcium mobilization represents an upstream event in the biochemical cascade activated by st1926 and cd437 in f9 cells. in
particular, rrm-dependent increases in cytosolic calcium preceded the appearance of any sign of apoptosis. as documented
by fig. 5c, the intracellular calcium chelator bapta (10 and 50
␮m) suppressed the elevation of calcium afforded by st1926 or
cd437 in both cell lines. figure 5d demonstrates that bapta
(10 ␮m) blocked the rrm-dependent caspase-3 activation observed in f9␥⫺/⫺ and f9-wt cells. these results indicate a
central role for calcium, even in the case of a transcription and
protein synthesis-dependent process of apoptosis like the one
activated by rrms in f9 cells.
comparison of the expression profiles associated
with st1926 and atra in f9-wt and f9␥ⴚ/ⴚ cells
indicates activation of retinoid-dependent and -independent pathways by rrms. f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells
were used to compare perturbations of the transcriptome
induced by equimolar concentrations of st1926 and atra.
with this type of experiment, we aimed at gathering information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the action
of st1926. in particular, we intended to identify the gene
profiles associated with the retinoid-dependent and -independent components of the rrm action. furthermore, we
wanted to establish the fraction of genes whose expression is
controlled or modulated by rar␥ activation.
as shown in fig. 6a, treatment of f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺
cells with st1926 or atra (0.5 ␮m) for 10 h results in a
significant up- or down-regulation of 2523 probes (2296
genes) (p ⬍ 0.0001 after two-way anova for any of the
two factors, cell line or treatment). a total of 903 probes
(847 genes) has regulation patterns relevant to the study
and can be classified in nine groups after pavlidis template

sults indicate that apoptosis was the main modality of the
observed rrm-induced cytotoxic effect.
equimolar concentrations of atra exerted no significant
effect on the proportion of live or apoptotic cells relative to
control conditions (fig. 4b). the apoptosis markers considered were negative in all types of f9 cells treated with up to
1 ␮m atra and for up to 6 days. indeed, f9␥⫺/⫺ cell
cultures exposed to 1 ␮m atra for 6 days contained 90 ⫾ 1%
live, 4 ⫾ 1% early apoptotic, 1 ⫾ 0.2% late apoptotic, and 4 ⫾
1% necrotic cells, compared with 92 ⫾ 1% live, 5 ⫾ 1% early
apoptotic, 1 ⫾ 0.1% late apoptotic and 3 ⫾ 1% necrotic cells in
the corresponding vehicle-treated cell cultures. similar results were obtained in f9-wt cells (data not shown). thus, in
conditions of complete cell-kill by st1926 and cd437, atra
did not show apoptotic or cytotoxic activity. the data indicate
that rar␥ expression neither mediated nor modulated rrminduced programmed cell death. in addition, they suggest
that activation of the  xxxd3417xxx  nuclear receptor pathway
is unlikely to be significant for the apoptotic process activated by rrms.
the apoptotic response of f9 cells to rrms involved an early rise in cytosolic calcium. one of the
earliest effects activated by rrms in the nb4 leukemia cell
line was is an increase in cytosolic calcium ions (garattini et
al., 2004a). we proposed that the phenomenon is at the basis
of the apoptotic process activated in this cell line. to establish whether perturbations in the homeostasis of calcium are
a general phenomenon, we performed a number of experiments in the f9 model.
in a first set of experiments (fig. 5a), the amounts of intracellular calcium were determined semiquantitatively in single
f9-wt cells grown as monolayers and preloaded with the calcium indicator fluo3-am. treatment of f9-wt cells for up to
one h with st1926, but not vehicle (data not shown), resulted in
a significant and time-dependent increase of intracellular calcium. this effect is evident in the majority of st1926 treated
cells. similar results were obtained in f9␥⫺/⫺ cells (data not
shown). to get quantitative information on the phenomenon,
fura-2 was measured continuously on suspensions of f9-wt
and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells after addition of st1926 or cd437 (fig. 5b).
treatment with the two rrms leads to an immediate increase
in the cytosolic levels of calcium with very similar time courses.

likely to be under the control of ligand-activated rar␥. homeobox a5 and iroquois-related-homeobox 2 belong to this
group, suggesting a particular significance for the process of
primitive endodermal maturation induced by st1926 and
atra. indeed, homeotic genes are well known  xxxd3417xxx 
targets and are implicated in morphogenesis and organogenesis (deschamps and van nes, 2005). several other members
of this family were noticeably induced preferentially by
atra in a rar␥-dependent fashion (fig. 6b, group 5). homeobox gene a1 (hoxa1) was the only hox gene induced
specifically by atra not only in f9-wt but also in f9␥⫺/⫺
cells (fig. 6b, group 4). however, the basal levels of hoxa1
expression were much higher in the former than in the latter
cell line (miamexpress; accession number e-mexp-361),
suggesting rar␥ independence in the case of induced expression and possible rar␥ dependence in the case of basal
expression.

significance and consisted of 11 genes. the sole gene up-

st1926 and atra in both f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells (fig. 6b).
this group consisted of genes possibly modulated by ligandinduced activation of rar␣/rar␤. among the genes whose
expression was diminished, myc and the dna methyltransferase 3b stand out. myc is a gene down-regulated by retinoids in different cellular contexts and is known to control
progression from the g1 to the s phase of the cycle. myc
down-regulation may play a role in the cell cycle arrest triggered by atra in g1 but is unlikely to be a major determinant of the g2/m arrest observed in the case of st1926. dna
methyl transferases are associated with gene silencing, and
their inhibition has been implicated in the gene activation
effects triggered by classic retinoids (fazi et al., 2005).

inhibitor (supplemental table 1), are also of particular interest. these observations indicate that st1926 has rar␥dependent effects on cellular processes other than proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
st1926 and cd437 modulated the same type of
genes. the results obtained with whole-genome microarrays were validated and extended to cd437 for a selected
number of genes. a first validation was conducted by semiquantitative agarose gel electrophoresis of the cdna
bands obtained by rt-pcr (fig. 8a, left). for c-kit, c-myc,
notch hom.3, and the homeo box a1 (hoxa1) gene, we
also obtained quantitative results by taqman real-time
pcr (fig. 8a, right). the experiments presented were
totally independent of each other and of the ones used for
the microarray analysis. the expression profile of all the
genes considered was entirely consistent with what was
observed with the microarray experiments. a small exception to this rule (1 of 10 genes, including rar␤; see below)
is represented by c-kit, which shows induction by st1926
(and cd437) also in f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. this may be because the
primers used for the rt-pcr and taqman real-time pcr
analyses are targeted against regions of the transcripts
that are different from those represented by the corresponding microarray probes. consistent with the primary
microarray data, the taqman data demonstrate that the
constitutive levels of the hoxa1 transcript are lower in
the f9␥⫺/⫺ than in f9-wt cells. it is noteworthy that all
these genes were regulated by cd437 in a fashion similar
to that of st1926, suggesting that the two compounds
activate a very similar genetic program. this further supports the concept that st1926 and cd437 belong to the
same functional family of compounds (garattini et al.,
2004a).
rar␤ belonged to the group of genes induced by atra
more than st1926 in both f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells (group
4). as a whole, the rt-pcr data (fig. 8b) confirmed that the
receptor was induced more efficiently by atra than by
rrms in f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. however, this differential effect was
not observed in f9-wt cells, also because of the lower basal
levels of the transcript in this cell line. although quantitative
differences in the induction of rar␤ by atra and st1926 or
cd437 were observed in f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells, the finding is in agreement with previous results indicating that
rar␤2 can be up-regulated by multiple rar isoforms in a
redundant fashion (rochette-egly and chambon, 2001). it is
noteworthy that rar␤ was the only retinoid receptor whose
expression was modulated by rrms or atra in f9 cells. in
fact, st1926, cd437, and atra did not affect the basal level

(leftmost lane of each experimental group), vehicle rna was labeled with the fluorochrome cy3, whereas atra- or st1926-rna was labeled with cy5.

microarrays. after filtering the data for significant changes using two-way anova (p ⬍ 0.0001), groups of genes with interesting regulation pattern
were selected after hierarchical clustering (group 1) or pavlidis template matching (all other groups). a, the scheme represents the number of probes

regulated in this group was the g protein ␣3, a polypeptide
involved in g-protein signaling.
genes specifically regulated by st1926 defined
nonretinoid-associated responses. the genes modulated by st1926, and not by atra, in both f9-wt and
f9␥⫺/⫺ cells (fig. 7, group 7) are likely to be relevant for
the selective in vitro apoptotic action and g2/m arrest
triggered by the rrm. consistent with this notion, 23 of
the 355 up-regulated genes are proapoptotic or involved in
the arrest of the cell cycle. for the same reason, 11 of the
163 down-regulated genes are positive modulators of cell
growth. the list of proapoptotic genes includes elements of
both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of programmed
cell death, such as p73, caspase-3, members of the tnf
receptor family, and traf4. as for tnf receptors, it is
important to underscore that these proteins belong to the
same family of the death receptors that plays a fundamental role in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. cd437 has
been proposed to exert its apoptotic action through activation of autocrine or paracrine loops involving death receptors and corresponding ligands, such as the fas and fasligand couple (sun et al., 2000b; jin et al., 2005). in group
7, perp,  xxxg169xxx , and bcl-2 binding component 3, are
direct or indirect targets of p53. it is noteworthy that f9
teratocarcinoma cells are known to express wild-type p53
(mayo and berberich, 1996), which sensitizes other types
of neoplastic cells to the action of rrms (sun et al., 1999).
given the importance of calcium in the process of apoptosis
triggered by rrms, the presence of 19 genes encoding
polypeptides, such as protein phosphatase 1d and diacylglycerol kinase ␣, regulated by the cation, was of particular significance. the modulation of these genes might be
the consequence of the early increase in calcium ions afforded by st1926 and cd437. group 7 contained a number
of induced genes involved in dna repair (four genes, six
probes; supplemental table 1), suggesting that st1926
may have dna damaging activity (garattini et al., 2004b).
groups 8 and 9 consisted of genes modulated by st1926,
but not atra, in either f9-wt or f9␥⫺/⫺ cells specifically.
in f9␥⫺/⫺ cells, treatment with st1926 caused down-regulation of four genes involved in motility and angiogenesis and
up-regulation of three genes responsible for cellular adhesion
(fig. 7, group 9). conversely, the rrm induced the expression of two cell motility and angiogenesis genes (septin 2 and
neuropilin) in f9-wt cells. induction of group 8 gene products acting at the interface between the cell and the extracellular space, such as receptors of the platelet-derived

of expression of rar␣, rar␥, or the three rxr isoforms (fig.
8b, left).
in vivo, the antitumor activity of rrms was hindered by rar␥ expression in the neoplastic cell. the
microarray results provide information on the possible molecular determinants of the rar␥-independent processes
(growth inhibition and apoptosis) triggered by rrms in f9

cell cultures. however, they also point to a set of rar␥dependent alterations in genes controlling processes of potential significance for the antitumor activity of rrms in
vivo, such as cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, proteolysis, and tumor/host interactions. indeed, the microarray results suggest that rrm antitumor activity might be higher in
the absence of rar␥.

route, in that a similar phenomenon was observed after i.p.
treatment with st1926 (fig. 9c). furthermore, the phenomenon was observed also in the case of the other rrm,
cd437. immunological responses do not seem to be at the
basis of the observed differences in sensitivity between the
f9␥⫺/⫺ and f9-wt tumors. this is supported by the results obtained in the b- and t-cell–deficient scid mouse
(fig. 9d). even in this model, st1926 and cd437 (i.p.
administered) demonstrate a superior effect on mice bearing f9␥⫺/⫺ tumors. thus, our results demonstrate that
rar␥ expression hinders the response of f9 cells to the
therapeutic activity of rrms in vivo. more importantly,
they suggest that the in vivo action of rrms is not simply
the result of a direct cytotoxic and growth inhibitory action
on tumor cells and may involve effects on the processes of
metastatization, angiogenesis, or interactions with the
host environment.

the above hypothesis was tested directly in vivo, taking
advantage of the fact that f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ grow as
tumors in syngeneic mice (fig. 1c). figure 9a demonstrates that long-term intraperitoneal administration of
atra at the maximal tolerated dose of 15 mg/kg did not
alter the survival of either f9-wt or f9␥⫺/⫺ tumor-bearing animals. the finding indicates that the atra-dependent antiproliferative and cytodifferentiation effects observed in cultures of f9 cells were not sufficient to
translate into a therapeutic effect in vivo. in contrast, fig.
9b demonstrates that oral administration of st1926 (30
mg/kg) resulted in a significant increase in the median
survival time of mice inoculated with both f9-wt and
f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. consistent with our hypothesis, st1926 was
much more effective in f9␥⫺/⫺ than in f9-wt tumorbearing animals. differential sensitivity of f9␥⫺/⫺ and
f9-wt tumors was independent of the administration

discussion
in this study, first we compared st1926 and cd437 to
atra for their ability to transactivate rar␣, rar␤, and
rar␥ in cos-7 transfected cells. the data indicate that
cd437 was a selective ligand of rar␥ and a stronger agonist
of the receptor than atra. st1926 itself was a better rar␥
transactivator than atra but lost rar␥ selectivity. both
st1926 and cd437 were poor rxr activators.
in f9 teratocarcinoma cells, we confirmed, in a native
context, that st1926 and cd437 were bona fide retinoids
and had the potential to activate rar␥. as expected from
classic retinoids with rar␥ agonistic activity, low concentrations of the two rrms were as effective as atra in inducing
the cytodifferentiation of f9-wt but not f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. the
results obtained with whole-genome microarrays support the
concept that st1926 is endowed with classic retinoid activity.

animals were administered vehicle or st1926 (30 mg/kg) orally, five
times a week for 2 weeks. c, six hours after inoculation, animals were i.p.
administered vehicle, st1926, or cd437 (20 mg/kg), five times a week for
2 weeks. d, six hours after inoculation, scid mice were i.p. administered
vehicle st1926 or cd437 (20 mg/kg) five times a week for 2 weeks.

st1926 modulates the expression of a large proportion of the
genes controlled by atra in f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. a
similar proportion of coregulated genes is observed in the
responses specific for the f9-wt cellular context, where
atra and rrm dependence is likely to be mediated by
rar␥. these genes are of particular interest for the differentiation of teratocarcinoma cells along the parietal
endoderm pathway.
the data obtained in the f9 model indicate that retinoid
activity was unlikely to play a significant role in rrm-induced apoptosis, which is a primary determinant of st1926
and cd437 antitumor activity. indeed, the apoptotic action of
rrms is not shared by atra, strongly suggesting that programmed cell death is not a direct consequence of the retinoid-dependent cytodifferentiating effects as in nb4 leukemic
cells (giannı̀ et al., 2000). furthermore, unlike cytodifferentiation, apoptosis was independent of rar␥ activation, as
observed in f9-wt, f9␥⫺/⫺, and f9␥51 cells. our results are
consistent with the idea that st1926 and cd437 activated
not only the classic retinoid pathway but also a second signaling pathway. in cultures of f9 cells, the second pathway is
prevalent and is at the basis of the apoptotic effect.
similar to what we observed in nb4 myeloid leukemia cells
(garattini et al., 2004a), the earliest event associated with
rrm-induced apoptosis in f9 cells is the elevation of cytosolic calcium. in nb4 cells, we demonstrated previously that
calcium increases are not due to a net influx of the cation
from the extracellular compartment and might be the result
of rrm effects on the reuptake of the ion by the mitochondrion. whatever the underlying mechanism, the rise in calcium is necessary for the programmed cell death activated by
rrms in nb4 and in f9 cells. in fact, in this last cell line,
whereas st1926 and cd437 were powerful calcium-mobilizing agents, atra and inactive rrms were devoid of this
activity. more importantly, chelation of intracellular calcium
by bapta prevented st1926-induced caspase activation,
one of the hallmarks of apoptosis. calcium mobilization was
not influenced by rar␥, in that identical effects were observed in the f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cell lines. although the
mobilization of calcium observed in rrm-treated f9 teratocarcinoma and nb4 cells is similar, the ensuing process of
apoptosis is intrinsically different. in nb4 cells, apoptosis is
very rapid and does not require gene expression or de novo
protein synthesis. in contrast, the apoptotic response of f9
cells was slower and might therefore be dependent on gene
transcription and protein synthesis. if this was indeed the
case, genes relevant for the rrm-dependent apoptosis in f9
cells must be sought for among the large number of probes
identified as specific and rar␥-independent targets of
st1926 (the genes controlled by st1926, but not atra, in
both f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells). this set of genes is of particular significance and deserves evaluation as to calcium-dependent transcriptional modulation.
the overall antitumor effect of rrms may be the result not
only of apoptotic but also of antiproliferative effects. to establish this point, we conducted studies with low and comparable concentrations of st1926 or cd437 and atra. under these conditions, the process of apoptosis activated by the
two rrms was delayed and the antiproliferative effects could
be studied in a relatively clean situation. our data demonstrate that st1926 and cd437 treatments were associated
with an early s and g2m cell cycle block in both f9-wt and

rar␥ and retinoid-related molecules

erted by st1926 (and cd437) that were not shared by atra
and that were likely to involve mechanisms unrelated to
retinoic receptor activation. the nonretinoid pathway leads
to g2/m cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which is mediated by
a perturbation of calcium homeostasis. these two processes
are likely to mediate a large proportion of the in vivo antitumor activity of both st1926 and cd437. although rar␣ and
rar␤ contribute to the genomic effects induced by st1926 in
f9 cells, activation of the two receptors does not seem to play
a significant role in the overall antitumor activity of st1926
and cd437 as well. activation of rar␥ by rrms leads to
cytodifferentiation; however, this phenomenon is unlikely to
have any significance for the in vivo antineoplastic action of
these compounds. in contrast, rar␥ seems to have an important modulatory and negative role on the response to
rrms in vivo, perhaps by acting on genes involved in cell
motility and adhesion.
in conclusion, the data presented provide the foundation
for future studies aimed to define the functional relevance of
the numerous genes modulated by rrms. our results also
have far-reaching implications at the clinical level, in that
they may orient the choice of target tumors. indeed, if rar␥related resistance is not limited to the f9 model, tumors with
low or undetectable levels of the receptor would represent the
primary targets against which to test st1926 in phase ii
clinical trials. finally, the genome-wide microarray data are
a useful resource to design rational combinations of rrms
and other chemotherapeutics.

f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. the cell cycle block afforded by atra is different and consists of a g1 arrest observed only after long
exposures (3– 4 days) (li et al., 2004). the g1 arrest caused
by atra in both f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells suggests involvement of rar␣ and or rar␤. the assumption is in line with
the observation that rar␤ activation is a critical determinant of the growth arrest induced by atra in f9 cells (faria
et al., 1999; zhuang et al., 2003).
although rar␥ is not a major determinant of rrms’
apoptotic and cytotoxic activity in vitro, the receptor seems
to play an important role in the response of f9 tumorbearing animals. syngeneic and immunodeficient mice
transplanted with f9␥⫺/⫺ cells are more sensitive to
rrms than the corresponding counterparts inoculated
with f9-wt cells. the phenomenon is not explained by
differences in basal growth, in that the f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺
untreated tumors grow in a similar fashion, show the same
histological appearance, and are lethal to animals in approximately the same amount of time. furthermore, the
phenomenon is unlikely to reflect clonal variability between the f9-wt and f9␥⫺/⫺ cells. in fact, animals transplanted with the two cell lines are equally insensitive to
atra, whereas they respond equally well to intraperitoneal injection of other chemotherapeutic agents, such as
cisplatin (m. m. barzago and e. garattini, unpublished
observations). although originally unexpected, this increased sensitivity may find an explanation in the profile
of genes selectively modulated by st1926 in either f9-wt
or f9␥⫺/⫺. in fact, the cell type-specific effects observed
on a number of genes controlling cell motility and angiogenic responses suggest relevance for the processes of invasion and metastasis. overall, our data indicate that
rar␥ expression modulates some aspects of the host/tumor interaction unrelated to immune responses.
