ligand-independent negative chronotropic responses of rat and mouse right atria to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.  negative chronotropic effects of beta-adrenoceptor (betaar) antagonists on right atria from reserpine-treated rats and mice were determined as a test of their  xxxd1422xxx  activities. betaar antagonist ici-118,551 and nonselective betaar antagonists  xxxd123xxx , propranolol, and  xxxd3377xxx  produced negative chronotropic effects. in contrast, nonselective betaar antagonists  xxxd2957xxx  and  xxxd2689xxx  as well as  xxxg91xxx -selective antagonists atenolol,  xxxd58xxx , and metoprolol did not cause a significant decrease in atrial rates. the neutral antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  but not the  xxxd1422xxx   xxxd123xxx  inhibited the negative chronotropic activities of ici-118,551.  xxxd2398xxx , salbutamol, and noradrenaline produced positive chronotropic effects; the chronotropic effects of  xxxd2398xxx  and salbutamol but not of noradrenaline were antagonized by ici-118,551. it is concluded that both  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  mediate positive chronotropic effects of catecholamines on rat and mouse atria but only  xxxg92xxx  are constitutively active.
