1. introduction

niceipline, iin rrgolitic derivative ester of bromonicotinic acid, possesses long-cstublished therapeutic
actions resulting from its cerebral and peripheral vasodilator effects 12. 10. 161. in spite of nuinerous phiirinacological studies, it3 incchanisin of action is still
not fully defined. lo this rcspcct, the best documented
action is an adrenoceptor antagonistic activity selectively exerted at the level o f alpha,-adretioceptors.
thus, in membranes prepiircd from rat cortex,  xxxd2719xxx  at nanomolar concentrations displaces specifically membrane hound jtl-pramsin or wb 4101,
whereas much higher coiiccntrations are required to
displace 3h-yohimbine or "h-dihydroalprenolol [ 1 i ,
13, 171. furthermore, hemodynamic effects of  xxxd2719xxx  in rats and dogs resemble more those of pram-

sin than those of  xxxd2914xxx  12, 10, 101. however.

lumilysergol. can displace bound 3h- xxxd3000xxx  from rat
cortical membranes i i7 i.
the above considerations pushed us to re-examine
the alpha,-adrenergic blocking activity o f  xxxd2719xxx 
in rats, with a particular emphasis on alpha,-adrenoceptor subtypes (for reviews of alpha,-adrenoceptor
subtypes see [ 8, 91). thus,  xxxd2719xxx  was tested:
( i ) for its ability to antagonize the pressor responses
elicited by the specific alpha,-agonist  xxxd1707xxx  [ 20)
in pithed rats, (ii) for its antagonism against cirazolineinduced contraction in isolated perfused rat mesenteric vascular bed, a preparation where the alpha,,-

 xxxd2719xxx  mnd alpha,, adrenweptors

adrenoceptor subtype is functionally predominant [4,
121 and in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta,
where the alpha,,-adrenoceptor subtype is functionally predominant and (iii) for its binding affinity to
alpha,-adrenoceptor subtypes. the main metabolites
of  xxxd2719xxx , lumilysergol and bromonicotinic acid,
were tested in parallel.

2. methods
2.1. pithed

rats

male sprague-dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were
briefly anesthetized with ether and pithed by inserting a
metal rod into the spinal canal via the right eye orbit. then.
animals were immediately tracheotomized and placed under
artificial respiration. the left carotid artery was cannulated
for measuring systemic blood prcssure. the contralateral
carotid artery was ligated and bilateral vagotomy was performed. i.v. injections were made through the femoral veins.
after an initial 30-min stabilization period, dose-response
curves to cumulative doses of  xxxd1707xxx , a specific agonist
of alpha, adrenoceptors [20]. and b-ht 920, a relatively
selective alpha, adrenoceptor agonist, were determined in
distinct groups of animals 30 niin after the initiation of
an i.v. infusion of  xxxd2719xxx  ( 0 . 5 pg/kg/min), pramsin
(0.5 pg/kg/min) or their vehicle (saline: 0.2 ml/kg/rnin).
b-ht 920 was also studied in a group of rats which received
a 100-fold higher dose of nicergolinc ( s o pg/kg/min i.v.).
the dose-response curves were cumulative because each
successive dose of agonist was administered as soon as thc
maximal response to the previou\ dose occurred. i n general.
the time interval between two contiguous doses was < 30 \ .

male wistar rats (250-300 g) were killed by cervical dislocation and exsanguinated. the superior mesenteric artery
was rapidly cannulated with an hypodermic needle at its
confluence with the aorta and flushed immediately with
warm krebs solution. the whole mesenteric bed was separated from the intestine by cutting close to the intestinal border and supported on a petri dish. the preparation was perfused at a constant flow ( 2 ml min-,) by means of a
peristaltic pump (ismatec, model ipc-4) with krebs solution
of the following composition (mm): nacl 118, kci 4.7,
caci, 2.5, mgso, 1.2, nahco, 25, kh,po, 1.2, glucose i 1,
gassed with 9 5 % 0 , / 5 % co, and mantained at 37 "c.
responses were measured by changes in perfusion pressure
(in mm hg) with pressure transducers (model 1050bp ufi,
morro bay, ca, usa) and recorded on a maclab system
(analog digital instruments, castle hill, australia).
the preparation was equilibrated 30 min prior to experimentation. the basal perfusion pressure was between 10 and

51

15 mmhg at the be ginning of the e xpe rim e nts, a n d
remained stable throughout the experimentation. following
the 30-min stabilization period, cumulative dose-pressor
response curves to bolus injections of the alpha,-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1707xxx  were determined in preparations perfused with  xxxd2719xxx  (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 nm),  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 nm), lumilysergol (0.03, 0.1, 0.3
and 1 pm) or their vehicle (saline). bolus doses of c i r u o line were injected through a rubber connection located close
to the cannulation point of the preparation.  xxxd2719xxx ,
 xxxd3000xxx  or lurnilysergol were infused continously via a
sidearm of the inflow of the perfusate. mean pressorresponse curves to  xxxd1707xxx  before and after the infusion of
drugs were taken as control. control experiments showed
that tissue responsiveness to  xxxd1707xxx  remained stable for
up to 5 h. multiple dose-response curves could be constructed on a \ingle preparation, allowing a better comparison between different antagonists.
in some experiments, mcsenteric vascular beds wcrc pretreated for 45 min with the alpha,, and alpha,,, irreversible
antagonist chlorethylclonidine (cec) 10 pm [ 12. is]. after
washing (30 min) and reequilibration of the preparations,
 xxxd2719xxx  was tcstcd as before.

2.3. isolated uortic rinx..r
male wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were dcprivcd of
food the evening and the morning before the experiment.
anesthesia was induced with pentobarbital sodium
(60 mg/kg i.p.). after cervical dislocation, their thoracic aortas were inmediately removed and carefully cleaned. the
endothelium was removed by gcntly rubbing the intimal surface of the aorta with a srnall wood stick. thc thoracic aorta
was cut into four rings ( 3 niin long) that were individually
placed between platinuin hooks i n 25 inl k r e h solution
maintained at 37 "c and gassed with 95% o,/s% (y)2. the
krebs medium contained (m m): nacl 1 18. naflc'o, 25.
 xxxg2125xxx , 1.25, kci 4.7, mgso, 1.2, khlpo, 1.2, glucose 11.5.
an initial load of i g was applied to the preparations and
maintained throughout a 90 min equilibration period during
which the incubation medium was renewed every 20 min.
tension was recorded on a maclab (analog digital instmments, castle hill, australia) via dynamometers pioden
control ufi (distributed through phymep, paris,france).
then, cumulative dose-tension response curves to  xxxd1707xxx 
were obtained in aortic rings incubated 20 min before, and
during the building up of the dose-response to the vasoconstrictor, with  xxxd2719xxx  (final concentration: i , 3, 10 and
30 nm),  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 nm), lumilysergol (0.1,
0.3 and 1 pm) or their vehicle (saline). an absence of functional endothelium was indicated by the failure of the preparation precontracted with a submaximum concentration of
 xxxd1707xxx  to relax to acethylcholine (1 pm).
in some experiments, aortic rings with and without endothelium were contracted with 100 nm phenylephrine (sub-

maximal concentration). when the contractile response
attained steady state (20-30 min) drugs were added in
increasing cumulative concentrations to generate concentration-relaxation curves. each succesive concentration was
added when the response to the previous concentration
reached an apparent maximum (- 10 min).
to investigate selectivity of  xxxd2719xxx  for alpha,-adrenoceptors, aortic rings were contracted with submaximum
concentrations of endothelin- 1 (et-1) or vasopressin
(avp). when the contractile response attained steady state,
 xxxd2719xxx  was added in increasing cumulative concentrations to generate concentration-relaxation curves. the
effects of  xxxd2719xxx  were compared with those of standard
antagonists. the antagonists used were bq 123 (cyc-(dtrpdasp-pro-dval-leu)) for et- 1 and skf 100273 (p-mercapto-p-p-cyclopentamethylenepropionyll , o - e t tyr2,val4,arg*-vasopressin) for avp.
2.4. binding studiej
2.4.1. alpha,, adrenoceptors
specific binding of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  to alpha,, adrenoceptors
was investigated by pretreating rat cortical membranes with
chlorethylclonidine (cec) according to minneman et al.
[ 151. binding of ['hi- xxxd3000xxx  to rat cortical membranes was
investigated according to the method of timmermans et al.
[ 191. briefly, membranes were incubated for 45 min at 30 "c
in 50 mm tris-hci (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm edta (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and 0.4 nm of ['hi- xxxd3000xxx 
(70-87 ci/mmol) with and without cold  xxxd3000xxx  (0.3-1 .o pm)
to estimate non-specific binding. the reaction was rapidly
terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters
and radioactivity trapped into the filters was determined.
specific binding always represented > 80% of total binding.
maximal receptor number (bmax)
was 190 fmovmg protein.
in control experiments, ['h]- xxxd3000xxx  specifically bound to
rat cortical membranes pretreated with cec was fully displaced by the selective alpha, a adrenoceptor antagonist
5-methylurapidil with k , = 20 nm [9].
to 5 x i e 7 m
 xxxd2719xxx  was tested in a range of
for its ability to displace [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  specifically bound to
rat cortical membranes pretreated with cec. in some
experiments, drugs were tested in rat cortical membranes
untreated with cec.
2.4.2.alpha,, adrenoceptors
specific binding of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  to alpha, adrenoceptors was investigated in rat liver membranes according to
minneman et al. [5, 151. briefly, membranes were incubated
for 45 min at 30 "c in 50 mm tris-hci (ph 7.4) containing 2 mm edta, 100 mm nacl and 0.2 nm of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  (70-87 ci/mmol) with and without cold  xxxd3000xxx 
(0.3-1 .o pm) to estimate non-specific binding. the reaction
was rapidly terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass
fiber filters and radioactivity trapped into the filters was

determined. specific binding always represented > 85%
of total binding. maximal receptor number (bmax)was
290 fmoymg protein.
2.5. compounds

 xxxd2719xxx  tartrate, lumilysergol base and bromonicotinic
acid were obtained from rhbne-poulenc-rorer laboratories
(montrouge, france).  xxxd1707xxx  hydrochloride was a gift of
synthelabo recherche (bagneux, france). b-ht 920 dihydrochloride was obtained from boehringer ingelheim (reims,
france). other compounds were purchased from merck
(darmstddt, germany), sigma (st. louis, mo, usa) or icn
biomedicals france (orsay, france). solutions of compounds
were freshly prepared every day. most compounds were
diluted in saline. a concentrated solution of lumilysergol base
in dmso (- 300 mm) was prepared and further diluted in
saline.  xxxd2719xxx  tartrate was only diluted in dmso for
doing the selectivity experiments in isolated rat aorta which
required high concentrations of the compound ( 10 pm). the
final concentrations of this vehicle exerted no significant effect
per se on the tension or pressure of the preparations studied.
2.6. statistical unalysis

unless otherwise indicated, values are reported as mean f
sem. in isolated vessels, dose-response curves to  xxxd1707xxx 
were fitted by linear regression analysis of the straight portions
of the vasoconstrictor responses. from the results of this analysis, the dose of  xxxd1707xxx  given 50% of the maximal response
was calculated (ed,"). relative antagonistic potencies (pa,:
-log of the dose of an antagonist causing a 2-fold, rightwards
displacement of the control  xxxd1707xxx -dose-response curve)
were estimated by applying the schild analysis 131. ic,, was
calculated by linear regression analysis applied to responses
enclosed between 20 and 80% of the maximum.
the responses to vasopressor agents in the pithed preparation are given as changes in mean carotid artery blood
pressure from baseline values. the doses of each vasopressor agent causing a 50 mmhg pressor response were calculated by fitting the experimental values with a least square
logistic curve [6].
statistical differences between two mean values were
determined by using a non-paired student's t-test. a significant shift (p < 0.05) refers to a significant difference
between the ed,, determined in the drug and the matched
vehicle treated group.

clearly,
 xxxd2719xxx  had identical inhibitory activity as  xxxd3000xxx  against alpha,-adrenoceptor induced pressor
responses, since both compounds similarly displaced
the control dose-response curve to  xxxd1707xxx .
to investigate the selectivity of  xxxd2719xxx  as an
alpha, -adrenergic antagonist, the compound was
tested for its inhibitory activity against pressor
responses elicited by b-ht 920 (a relatively specific
alph%-agonist) in pithed rats. figure i (lower pannel)
shows the dose-pressor responses curves obtained by
i.v. administration of cumulative doses of b-ht 920.
it can be seen that  xxxd2719xxx  (0.5 pg/kg/min i.v.) did
not significantly displaced the control curve to b-ht
920. even a very high dose of  xxxd2719xxx  (so pg/kg/
min i.v.) was unable to significantly displace the control
curve to b-ht 920. in contrast to  xxxd2719xxx , the alph%adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine antagonized the
pressor response to b-ht 920 (3- to 4-fold rightwards
shift of the control dose-response curve, table zr).

4. discussion

at least three native alpha,-adrenoceptors have
been identified pharmacologically (for reviews see
[8,9]), i.e.: (i) the alpha,,-adrenoceptor subtype,
which is functionally predominant in the rat kidney
and the rat mesenteric vascular bed [4, 121, (ii)
alphalb-adrenoceptors, where radioligand binding

studies have detected a relatively pure population in
the rat liver [ 5 ] and (iii) the alpha,,-adrenoceptor subtype, which is functionally predominant in rat aorta.
sensitivity to irreversible inactivation by chloroethylclonidine (cec) was frequently used to differentiate
alpha,,- and alpha,,-adrenoceptors from alpha,,adrenoceptors (these latter being relatively cecresistant) [12, 151. finally, it has been previously
suggested that the density or role of alpha,,-adrenoceptors may be greater in resistance vessels than in
conduit vessels [ 121.
our results show that  xxxd2719xxx  is a potent and
selective alpha,,-adrenoceptor subtype antagonist.
first,  xxxd2719xxx  was approximately 300-fold more

potent as an antagonist of alpha,-adrenoceptors in the
rat mesenteric vascular bed than in rat aorta, whereas
 xxxd3000xxx  was of similar potency in both preparations
(table izi). second, pretreatment of mesenteric vascular beds with chloroethylclonidine was unable to modify the potency of  xxxd2719xxx  to antagonize  xxxd1707xxx . third,  xxxd2719xxx  was 60 times more potent to
displace specifically bound [3hh]- xxxd3000xxx  in rat brain
membranes pretreated with chloroethylclonidine than
in rat liver membranes. finally,  xxxd2719xxx  was as
potent as  xxxd3000xxx  to reduce pressor responses to
 xxxd1707xxx  in pithed rats (fable i and f i g u r c i, upper
pannel). taking together, all these results showed that
 xxxd2719xxx  is a potent and selective alpha, ,-adrenoceptor subtype antagonist.
in the micromolar range,  xxxd2719xxx  acts  xxxd2216xxx ,adrenoceptors in rat brain membranes [ 171 and in
human platelets [ 131. this can explain the poor relaxant effects found by oudart and plotkine [ 181 in
isolated norepinephrine-contracted middle cerebral
arteries of the rabbit (vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline in cat middle cerebral arteries are almost
entirely mediated by alpha,-adrenoceptors [ 141). on
the other hand,  xxxd2719xxx  effects  xxxd2216xxx ,-adrenoceptors are irrelevant in vivo, since  xxxd2719xxx  was
unable to significantly displace the control pressor
responses to the relatively specific alpha,-agonist
b-ht 920 in pithed rats.
 xxxd2719xxx  was inactive against vasoconstrictor
responses to et-1 and avp in rat aorta. moreover,
huchet et al. [lo] have previously found in dogs that

58

m. alvarez-guerra et al.

 xxxd2719xxx  (up to 3 mgkg i.v.) was unable to antagonize
pressor responses to dopamine. however,  xxxd2719xxx 
has previously been found to exert moderate displacement of 3h-serotonin binding in rat brain membranes
[ 1i]. therefore, further investigation is required to investigate  xxxd2719xxx  effects at vascular serotonin receptors.
given the extensive metabolic transformation of
 xxxd2719xxx  into lumilysergol and bromonicotinic acid
[ 11, these two important metabolites of  xxxd2719xxx 
were also investigated here. although lumilysergol
possesses modest alpha, antagonist effects, it was 2 to
4 orders of magnitude less potent than  xxxd2719xxx  or
 xxxd3000xxx  in blocking alpha, -adrenoceptor stimulation
in the isolated mesenteric vascular bed and in rat
aorta. moreover, in radioligand binding studies its
affinity for rat brain alpha,-adrenoceptors was much
lower than that of  xxxd2719xxx . bromonicotinic acid
was inactive in all preparations used in this investigation. therefore, lumilysergol, but not bromonicotinic
acid, is an active metabolite of  xxxd2719xxx . in this
respect, we cannot exclude that a small fraction of the
alpha, -adrenergic blocking action of  xxxd2719xxx  in
pithed rats can be due to lumilysergol.
in conclusion,  xxxd2719xxx  is as potent and selective
as  xxxd3000xxx  in blocking alpha,-adrenoceptor stimulation in vivo in the rat. this action correlates well with
the very potent alpha, -adrenoceptor antagonism by
 xxxd2719xxx  in the isolated rat mesenteric vascular bed,
but not in rat aorta. these results and the binding
experiments revealed that  xxxd2719xxx  is a potent and
selective alpha,,-adrenoceptor subtype antagonist, an
alpha,-adrenoceptor subtype which is mainly represented in resistance arteries.
