a b s t r a c t
tacrolimus (fk506) and  xxxd1781xxx  (cys a) are immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of
inﬂammatory diseases and for preventing rejection of allogeneic transplants. tacrolimus forms a complex
with fk506 binding protein (fkbp), and cys a forms a complex with  xxxg798xxx . these tacrolimus–fkbp and
cys a– xxxg798xxx  complexes interact with calcineurin (can), thereby suppressing activation of t cells. in
contrast, steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs suppress the immune system mainly via inhibition of nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells ( xxxg1559xxx ) and the activating protein-1 (ap-1) pathway.
previously, we reported that tacrolimus, but not dexamethasone, reduced scratching behavior in a murine
model of atopic dermatitis. to elucidate the mechanism involved in the inhibition of scratching behavior, we
used a mouse model of allergic dermatitis to compare the characteristics of tacrolimus and cys a treatment.
we found that cys a suppressed scratching behavior induced by application of 2,4-dinitroﬂuorobenzene, as
did tacrolimus. in addition, both drugs attenuated increases in vascular permeability and scratching behavior
induced by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. these results indicate that inhibition of the can pathway plays an
important role in tacrolimus- and cys a-induced inhibition of scratching behavior in mice. furthermore, we
observed that can inhibitors suppressed mast cell-dependent allergic reaction.

1. introduction
atopic dermatitis is frequently refractory to treatment. therapy for
inﬂammatory eczema and pruritus involves the use of steroid and
tacrolimus ointments for inﬂammation, and antihistamines and
antiallergic drugs for pruritus (furue et al., 2004). pruritus is the
hallmark of atopic dermatitis, and chronic and severe pruritus can
have a deleterious impact on patient quality of life. furthermore,
scratching damages the skin barrier and worsens inﬂammation of
skin, resulting in more itching (wahlgren, 1999). although antihistamines are frequently used to suppress pruritus in atopic
dermatitis, little objective evidence exists to demonstrate their
effectiveness (klein and clark, 1999). however, tacrolimus did
improve the clinical score in an assessment of pruritus (ruzicka et
al., 1997; boguniewicz et al., 1998).
in 2008,  xxxd1781xxx  (cys a) was introduced in japan for the
treatment of severe atopic dermatitis. cys a is cyclic peptide of 11
amino acids derived from the fungus tolypocladium inﬂatum gams
(pritchard, 2005), and is a representative immunosuppressive drug
for preventing rejection of transplanted liver, kidney, heart, and lung
(frei, 1999). oral administration of cys a is an effective treatment for
immunological diseases such as psoriasis, behcet's syndrome, and

nephrosis syndrome. in addition, it was reported that cys a
signiﬁcantly reduced pruritus intensity, eczema score, and the total
number of blood eosinophils (wahlgren et al., 1990).
by forming a complex with fk506 binding protein (fkbp),
tacrolimus suppresses activation of t cells; cys a achieves the same
result by forming a complex with  xxxg798xxx . because the complexes
interact with and inhibit calcineurin (can), activation of t cells is
suppressed (liu et al., 1991). in contrast, steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs are frequently used for treatment of allergic diseases.
glucocorticoids suppress immune inﬂammation by interacting with
various transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa-lightchain-enhancer of activated b cells ( xxxg1559xxx ) and activating protein-1
(ap-1), which activate transcription of genes for inﬂammatory
cytokines and enzymes.
previously, we reported that, in mice, repeated treatment with 2,4dinitroﬂuorobenzene (dnfb) at a concentration of 0.15%, dissolved in
acetone, induced eczematous changes of the skin, including marked
inﬁltration of neutrophils and eosinophils and hypertrophy of
epidermis (nagai et al., 1997), and caused a persistent increase in
scratching behavior (inagaki et al., 2006). tacrolimus suppressed the
scratching behavior induced by the application of dnfb solution, but
dexamethasone did not (inagaki et al., 2006). our ﬁndings suggested
that tacrolimus was not dependent on an intermediary of the ikappab/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway in its suppression of scratching behavior in the mouse
model. however, the mechanism responsible for tacrolimus-induced
suppression of scratching behavior remains unknown.

in the present study, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for
tacrolimus-induced inhibition of scratching behavior, we used a
mouse model of atopic dermatitis to compare the effects of tacrolimus
with those of cys a.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
seven-week-old male balb/c mice and male icr mice were
purchased from slc, inc. (hamamatsu, japan). mice were housed in
an air-conditioned animal room at a temperature of 22 ± 1 °c and a
humidity of 60 ± 5%. experiments were undertaken in adherence with
the guidelines established by the animal experiment committee of
gifu pharmaceutical university. the animal experiment committee of
our university approved the experimental protocols employed.
2.2. antigens and antibody
2,4-dinitroﬂuorobenzene (dnfb, sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo, usa) was used to induce cutaneous reaction. dnfb was dissolved
in acetone at a concentration of 0.15%. dinitrophenyl-conjugated
ascaris suum extract (dnp-asc) and dnp-conjugated bovine serum
albumin (dnp-bsa) were prepared using the method of eisen et al.
(1954).  xxxd131xxx  gel (alum) was used as an adjuvant for
sensitization of dnp-asc. dnp-asc 10 mug in the presence of alum 1 mg
(dnp-asc/alum) was injected intraperitoneally for sensitization.
mouse monoclonal ige antibody against dnp residue (anti-dnp ige
mab) was prepared by culturing a cell line, ec1, as reported
previously (sakurai et al., 1994). the culture supernatant of ec1 was
stored at − 80 °c. the ige content of the preparation, as estimated by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), was 1.5 mug/ml.
2.3. drugs
tacrolimus (astellas pharma inc., tokyo, japan) was dissolved in
ethanol at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1%, and applied topically to
both sides of each ear lobe in a total volume of 100 mul.  xxxd1781xxx 
(wako pure chemical industries, ltd., osaka, japan) was dissolved in
0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (nacalai tesque, kyoto, japan)
solution, and administered orally at doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/
kg, or topically at a concentration of 0.1%. dexamethasone (sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa) was dissolved in ethanol at a
concentration of 0.01%.
in an experiment on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca),
tacrolimus at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg,  xxxd1781xxx  at doses of 10
and 30 mg/kg, and diphenhydramine (dph, sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo, usa) at a dose of 20 mg/kg, were dissolved in 0.5%
carboxymethyl cellulose sodium and administered orally 1 h before
eliciting the reaction.
2.4. induction of cutaneous reaction and scratching behavior by
application of dnfb
dermatitis and scratching behavior were induced by repeated
treatment of each surface of both ears with dnfb solution in balb/c
mice, as previously described (inagaki et al., 2010). brieﬂy, 2 weeks
after sensitization with dnp-asc/alum, a total volume of 100 mul of
0.15% dnfb acetone solution was topically applied 5 times every 48 h
to both sides of each ear lobe of the mice. two weeks after the ﬁfth
application, the mice received a similar ﬁnal challenge. control mice
were similarly treated with acetone in the absence of dnfb (vehicle).
each drug was treated one time or for 10 days before the ﬁnal dnfb
application.

2.5. evaluation of cutaneous reaction
cutaneous reaction was evaluated by ear swelling induced by the
ﬁnal challenge with dnfb. ear thickness was measured using a dial
thickness gauge (ozaki mfg co., ltd., tokyo, japan) and was
expressed as the increase in ear thickness from the pre-challenge
value.
2.6. evaluation of scratching behavior
scratching behavior was measured using the microact system
(neuroscience, tokyo, japan), by which scratching behavior is
automatically detected and objectively analyzed (inagaki et al.,
2002, 2003). brieﬂy, a small magnet (1 mm in diameter, 3 mm long,
coated with teﬂon) was inserted subcutaneously into both hind paws
under ether anesthesia, at least 1 week before the start of the
experiment. mice with inserted magnets were placed in an observation chamber (11 cm in diameter, 18 cm high) that was surrounded
by a round coil. the electric current induced in the coil by the
movement of magnets attached to the mouse hind paws was
ampliﬁed and recorded. then, characteristic waves corresponding to
scratching behaviors were detected by using a computer. parameters
for the detection of consecutive scratching behavior were upper limit,
0.90 v; lower limit, 0.03 v; event gap, 0.05 s; maximum frequency,
20.0 hz; minimum frequency, 3.0 hz; and minimum duration, 0.43 s.
the results of scratching behavior were expressed as both the
incidence of consecutive scratching behavior and total duration of
scratching in the period from 0 to 2 h after dnfb challenge.
2.7. detection of mrna expression
effects of drugs on mrna expression in ears of the mice were
evaluated by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (rt-pcr). in brief, total rna was extracted from excised
ears of the mice using isogen (nippon gene co., ltd., tokyo, japan).
cdna was prepared from the rna by reverse transcription (superscript ii, invitrogen corporation, ca, usa) and then ampliﬁed by pcr
icycler. pcr products were analyzed by icycler iq real time detection
system. primers employed and the conditions are listed in supplemental table 1. expression of cytokines was corrected by each
expression of  xxxg53xxx .
2.8. histological analysis
right ears of the mice were excised before corresponding timing to
the last dnfb challenge, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded
in parafﬁn. sections (3 mum) were stained with acidic toluidine blue
(ph 4.1), and number of mast cells and ratio of degranulated mast
cells in 3 sights chosen high-power ﬁeld at random was counted.
2.9. passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca)
male icr mice were passively sensitized by intradermal injection
of anti-dnp ige mab at a volume of 20 mul into clipped back skin.
twenty-four hours after the sensitization, pca was elicited by
intravenous injection of 0.25 ml of 0.5% evans blue saline solution
containing 0.1 mg/ml of dnp-bsa. immediately after antigen challenge, mice were placed in a chamber for observation of scratching
behavior for 1 h, as mentioned above. after evaluation of scratching
behavior, mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation, and the back
skin that was stained by extravasated evans blue was removed to
measure the increase in vascular permeability. quantiﬁcation of
extravasated dye was performed using a previously described method
(inagaki et al., 1984). brieﬂy, the back skin from a mouse was
dissolved in 0.7 ml of 1 n koh solution at 37 °c overnight, and 9.3 ml
of a mixture of 0.6 n phosphoric acid and acetone (5:13) was added.

h. yamashita et al. / european journal of pharmacology 645 (2010) 171–176

after vigorous shaking, precipitates were ﬁltered off and the amount
of dye was measured colorimetrically at 620 nm.
2.10. statistical analysis
the data were expressed as the mean values plus standard error.
the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference between 2 values was
evaluated by the student or welch t-test using statlight (yukms co.,
ltd., tokyo, japan). comparison of data from the tacrolimus, cys a, and
control groups was performed using the dunnett comparison test. a p
value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
3. results
3.1. application-timing for tacrolimus
tacrolimus at a concentration of 0.1% was applied topically to both
sides of each ear 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h before the ﬁnal dnfb challenge. at
all time points, tacrolimus signiﬁcantly reduced the number of scratch
attempts (fig. 1a) and duration of scratching (fig. 1b) induced by the
ﬁnal challenge. the most potent inhibition of scratching behavior was
observed when tacrolimus was given 8 h before challenge. ear
swelling at 6 h after the ﬁnal dnfb challenge was signiﬁcantly
suppressed by tacrolimus given 8 h before challenge (fig. 1c). ear
swelling at 24 h was suppressed by tacrolimus at all time points, and
the suppression by tacrolimus given 8 h before challenge was the
most potent (fig. 1d).

examined. the drug was applied 8 h before the ﬁnal challenge.
tacrolimus concentration-dependently suppressed the incidence and
duration of scratching behavior (fig. 2a, b), as well as ear swelling, at
6 and 24 h after the ﬁnal challenge (fig. 3c, d). this suppression was
signiﬁcant at concentrations of 0.1% and 1%.
3.3. administration-timing for  xxxd1781xxx  (cys a)
cys a at a dose of 30 mg/kg was administered orally 1, 2, 4, 8, and
12 h before the ﬁnal dnfb challenge. at all time points, oral
administration of cys a signiﬁcantly reduced scratch number
(fig. 3a) and scratching time (fig. 3b) induced by the ﬁnal challenge.
the inhibition of scratching behavior was most potent when cys a
was administered 4 h before the challenge. cys a suppressed ear
swelling at 6 h after the ﬁnal challenge, but the suppression was
signiﬁcant only when the drug was administered 1 or 2 h before the
challenge (fig. 3c). cys a did not affect ear swelling at 24 h after the
challenge (fig. 3d). tacrolimus at a concentration of 0.1% applied
topically 1 h before challenge signiﬁcantly suppressed both scratching
behavior and ear swelling (fig. 3a–d).
3.4. dose-dependency for cys a

the effects of tacrolimus concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 1%
on ear swelling and scratching behavior elicited by dnfb were

cys a suppressed ear swelling most potently when given 1 h
before the challenge. furthermore, scratching behavior was also
signiﬁcantly suppressed by the drug when given 1 h before challenge.
therefore, cys a was administered orally at doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, and
100 mg/kg 1 h before the ﬁnal dnfb challenge. cys a suppressed both
the incidence and duration of scratching behavior (fig. 4a, b) in a
nearly dose-dependent fashion, and suppression at a dose of 30 mg/kg
was signiﬁcant. cys a dose-dependently decreased ear swelling at 6 h
after the dnfb challenge, and suppression at doses of 30 and 100 mg/

was not affected by the drug (fig. 4d). topical tacrolimus at a
concentration of 0.1% applied 1 h before challenge signiﬁcantly
suppressed both scratching behavior and ear swelling (fig. 4a–d).

administered orally 1 h before elicitation of pca. tacrolimus and cys a
dose-dependently suppressed scratching behavior and dye leakage
associated with pca (fig. 5). suppression by 3 and 10 mg/kg of
tacrolimus and 30 mg/kg of cys a was signiﬁcant. diphenhydramine
also signiﬁcantly suppressed scratching behavior and dye leakage
(fig. 5c).

3.5. repeated application of tacrolimus and  xxxd1781xxx 
tacrolimus at concentration of 0.1%, cys a at a dose of 30 mg/kg
and dexamethasone at a concentration of 0.05% were treated for
10 days before the ﬁnal dnfb challenge. ear swelling 6 h (supplementary fig. 1a) and 24 h (supplementary fig. 1b) after the challenge
was inhibited by repeated treatment of the drugs as well as single
treatment. scratching behavior was suppressed by repeated treatment of tacrolimus and cys a, but not by dexamethasone (supplementary fig. 1c, d).
il-4, il-13,  xxxg1141xxx  and  xxxd2090xxx  mrna expressions in the ears of mice
treated with the drugs were detected by real time rt-pcr (supplementary fig. 2). in this model, both th2 cytokines (il-4 and il-13) and
th1 cytokine ( xxxg1141xxx ), and  xxxd2090xxx  which related with pruritus were upregulated by dnfb painting. tacrolimus, cys a and dexamethasone
suppressed expression of th1 and th2 cytokines, but dexamethasone
failed to suppress up-regulation of  xxxd2090xxx  expression.
topical treatments of cys a at a concentration of 0.1% once and for
10 days failed to suppress scratching behavior (supplementary fig. 3).
3.6. effects of tacrolimus and cys a on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca)
the effects of tacrolimus and cys a on scratching behavior and the
increase in vascular permeability associated with pca were examined.

30 mg/kg, and diphenhydramine at 20 mg/kg (positive control) were

3.7. histological analysis
right ears of the mice which were applied with tacrolimus
topically and cys a orally once were excised right before the last
dnfb challenge, and sliced ear sections were stained by toluidine
blue. number of mast cells and ratio of degranulated mast cells were
counted in 3 sights chosen high-power ﬁeld at random. tacrolimus
and cys a did not affect on the mast cells number, and tend to inhibit
the degranulation (supplementary table 2).
4. discussion
in our previous report, tacrolimus and dexamethasone inhibited
inﬂammation in back skin induced by repeated hapten treatment;
tacrolimus simultaneously suppressed scratching behavior associated
with the hapten treatment, but dexamethasone did not (inagaki et al.,
2006; supplementary fig. 3). in the present study, we investigated the
characteristics of tacrolimus-induced suppression of scratching
behavior by comparing tacrolimus to another calcineurin (can)
inhibitor,  xxxd1781xxx  (cys a).
first, the optimal concentration and timing of administration of
tacrolimus were studied. tacrolimus suppressed scratching behavior
and ear swelling for a prolonged period, and was most effective when

evaluated for 1 h after pca challenge. the vascular permeability was assessed by
measuring the amount of evan's blue dye induced by pca (c). each value represents the
mean ± s.e.m. of 8 or 9 mice. (−), no challenge; (+), pca; cys a,  xxxd1781xxx ; tac,

given 8 h before the ﬁnal dnfb challenge (fig. 1). because topical
treatment with cys a at a concentration of 0.1% had no effect on
scratching behavior (supplementary fig. 3), cys a was administered
orally. cys a suppressed scratching behavior most effectively when
given 4 h before challenge, and ear swelling when given 1 h before.
the effect of cys a on scratching behavior was prolonged, and peaked
between 4 h and 8 h; similar results were observed with tacrolimus.
however, although cys a maximally inhibited ear swelling when
given 1 h before challenge, tacrolimus did so when given 8 h before
(fig. 3).
time to maximum drug concentration (tmax) after oral administration of cys a in healthy adult humans is approximately 1.6 h
(avramoff et al., 2007; piñyro-lóez et al., 2007), whereas that of
tacrolimus ointment is approximately 6 h in atopic dermatitis patients
(kawashima et al., 1997). our results regarding ear swelling suggest
the possibility of a negative correlation with the tmax of these drugs.
furthermore, the results at 24 h after challenge were similar to these
at 6 h. this discrepancy with respect to the most effective administration timing of cys a for suppression of scratching behavior and ear
swelling might be due to a variety of factors; the reasons are unclear at
present. the present ﬁndings suggest that cys a and tacrolimus
suppressed scratching by the same mechanism—the can pathway—
but that the mechanisms responsible for their effects on inﬂammation
differed.
the molecular weight of cys a is approximately 1200, and that of
tacrolimus is approximately 800. generally, compounds with a
molecular weight higher than 500 do not penetrate normal skin.
however, compounds with higher molecular weights, such as
tacrolimus, can penetrate inﬂammatory skin when the skin-barrier
is broken. in ear lobes repeatedly exposed to dnfb the skin-barrier is
disrupted, and tacrolimus, but not cys a, can penetrate the skin.
immunological stimulation induces production of il-2 via activation of nuclear factor of activated t-cells (nfat) transcription in t

175

cells (jain et al., 1992). when antigen-presenting cells interact with t
cell receptors on t cells, phospholipase cgamma (plcgamma) is activated to
hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (pip2) in plasma
membranes to inositol triphosphate (ip3). then, ca2+ mobilized by
ip3 from endoplasmic reticulum (er) activates calcineurin (can), a
calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, by binding a
regulatory subunit and activating calmodulin (cam) binding. can
induces nfat activation, which is important in the transcription of
inﬂammatory genes necessary to produce a variety of cytokines. the
tacrolimus–fkbp and cys a– xxxg798xxx  complexes bind to and inhibit
the activity of can and suppress the transcription by nfat (fruman et
al., 1992; ho et al., 1996). tacrolimus also suppresses the inﬂammatory cytokine gene expression dependent on the ap-1 pathway
(okamoto et al., 1994). tacrolimus and cys a can suppress human
neutrophil chemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by
inhibiting il-8, a chemoattractant of neutrophils (sasakawa et al.,
2000).
in contrast, steroids bind to  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) in
cytoplasm, and the glucocorticoid–gr complex is transported to the
nucleus for binding to the glucocorticoid responsive element (gre).
inhibitor of kappab (ikappab) masks the nuclear translocation signal of
nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells ( xxxg1559xxx ) proteins and keeps them in an inactive state in the cytoplasm
(jacobs and harrison, 1998). in addition, glucocorticoids prevent  xxxg1222xxx  phosphorylation followed by ap-1 activation by blocking the
induction of the jun amino-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling cascade
(caelles et al., 1997). the fact that tacrolimus and cys a, but not
dexamethasone, suppressed scratching behavior in the present
experimental model suggests that the pruritus depends on the
cam–can pathway.
degranulation of mast cells dependent on ige is one of the most
important factors in inducing scratching behavior in a mouse model of
atopic dermatitis (yamashita et al., 2005, 2009). therefore, we
examined whether the effects of tacrolimus and cys a on scratching
behavior and the increase in vascular permeability were caused by
passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca). we found that, in mice, oral
administration of tacrolimus and cys a inhibited pca, scratching
behavior, and vascular permeability. topical application of tacrolimus
did not inhibit pca (data not shown), probably because the skin of the
mouse ear lobes was normal when pca was induced: tacrolimus, with
its molecular weight of 800, could not penetrate the skin. in addition,
tacrolimus and cys a inhibited mast cells degranulation in inﬂammatory skin (supplementary table 2). we hypothesize that inhibition
of ige-dependent degranulation of mast cells is one mechanism
underlying the tacrolimus- and cys a-induced suppression of
scratching behavior.
tacrolimus at a concentration of 0.1%, cys a at a dose of 30 mg/kg
and dexamethasone at a concentration of 0.05% were treated for
10 days before the last dnfb challenge (supplementary fig. 1).
repeated treatment of tacrolimus and cys a was suppressed ear
swelling and scratching behavior, but dexamethasone failed to
suppress the up-regulation of scratching behavior as well as single
treatment. these date supported the difference of action mechanism
between tacrolimus, cys a and dexamethasone. additionally, il-4, il13 and  xxxg1141xxx , which are inﬂammatory cytokines, were suppressed by
tacrolimus, cys a and dexamethasone, however,  xxxd2090xxx  related itchy
(sonkoly et al., 2006) was not suppressed by dexamethasone
(supplementary fig. 2). the cytokine proﬁle corresponded with ear
swelling and scratching.
in conclusion, tacrolimus and cys a similarly suppressed scratching behavior induced by application of a 0.15% dnfb solution. both
drugs also suppressed scratching behavior associated with pca. these
results suggest that the suppression of scratching behavior by
tacrolimus and cys a depends on the cam–can pathway. studies of
the target cells and the exact mechanisms involved are now
underway.
