abstract—the 11c-labeled  xxxg19xxx  ( xxxg19xxx ) ligand (s)-2-([11c]methoxy)-4-[3-methyl-1-(2-piperidine-1-yl-phenyl)butyl-carbamoyl]- xxxd306xxx  ([11c]methoxy- xxxd3098xxx ) was synthesized in an overall radiochemical yield of 35% after 55 min with
a radiochemical purity higher than 99%. this compound is considered for the noninvasive investigation of the  xxxg19xxx  receptor status
of pancreatic b-cells by positron emission tomography (pet) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. the speciﬁc activity was
40–70 gbq/lmol. in vitro testing of the nonradioactive methoxy- xxxd3098xxx  was performed to characterize the aﬃnity for binding
to the human  xxxg19xxx  isoform. methoxy- xxxd3098xxx  induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a hill coeﬃcient close to 1
(1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (kd) of 83 nm and an ic50 of 163 nm. insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets were
performed to prove biological activity, which was determined to be in the same range as that of original  xxxd3098xxx .

diabetes mellitus comprises a heterogeneous group of
disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels.
two major types of diabetes mellitus have been deﬁned:
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. although hyperglycemia is
the common denominator of both, the etiology and
pathophysiology of these syndromes are distinct. type
1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of insulin-producing
b-cells of the islets of langerhans. when autoimmune
destruction aﬀects more than 90% of the b-cell mass,
the resulting insulin deﬁciency culminates into the development of overt hyperglycemia. in type 2 diabetes,
on the other hand, the pancreatic b-cells are initially intact, and the disease is associated with insulin resistance and loss of b-cell function, and eventual insulin
dependency.1,2

insulin secretion is regulated by the membrane potential
of the b-cell, which depends on the activity of atp-sensitive k+ channels (katp channels) in the plasma membrane.3 closure of katp channels due to a rise of the
cytoplasmic atp/adp ratio results in a depolarization
of the membrane and in opening of voltage-sensitive
ca2+ channels. the increase in cytoplasmic ca2+ stimulates the exocytosis of insulin.
katp channels are composed of a small  xxxg1249xxx  subunit (kir6.1 or  xxxg1250xxx ) plus a sulfonylurea receptor ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a or sur2b)
belonging to the atp-binding cassette superfamily.4
surs represent the target for hypoglycemic sulfonylureas, a group of well-known antidiabetic agents, which
have been in clinical use for years.  xxxd3098xxx  is a novel
fast acting prandial glucose regulator with a short plasma half-life (<1 h).5–7 diﬀerent from the sulfonylurea
class,  xxxd3098xxx  is the ﬁrst member of the carbamoylmethylbenzoic acid chemical family to be used in a clinical setting, being a new chemical class of insulin

secretagogues with an insulin release proﬁle, which is
very diﬀerent to sulfonylureas like  xxxd2215xxx .8 the
development of radioligands, which bind avidly to subtypes of k+ channels is an important task for k+ channel research.9–11 recently, enantiomerically pure
[14c] xxxd3098xxx  was used to obtain in vivo data about
its metabolism and way of excretion.12 a detriment of
this study was the low speciﬁc activity (2–50 ci/mmol)
of the radiotracer and additionally the use of carbon14 whose radiation characteristics (short range b particle, half-life t1/2 = 5730 a) preclude a noninvasive investigation. noninvasive investigations may become
available by using a radioactive analogue with high
speciﬁc activity and labeled with a positron emitting
radionuclide, for example, 11c or 18f. positron emission
tomography (pet) is a promising imaging technique to
quantitatively assess biodistribution of radiolabeled
pharmaceuticals noninvasively in humans and animals
in vivo. this method is pre-destined to quantify and
visualize the receptor status of diverse receptor systems.
radiolabeled sulfonylureas such as 18f-labeled  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  derivatives have been
described13,14 and reviewed recently.15 these compounds have been proven to be unsuitable for b-cell
quantiﬁcation by shiue and co-workers.16 recently
sweet et al. performed a systematic screening of potential b-cell imaging agents such as  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , serotonin, l-dopa, dopamin, nicotinamide,
ﬂuorodeoxyglucose, and ﬂuorodithizone and concluded
that none of these compounds were likely candidates
providing suﬃcient speciﬁcity for quantiﬁcation with
pet.17 most recently our group investigated a promising 18f-labeled derivative of  xxxd3098xxx  whose accumulation in rat pancreas could be displaced by  xxxd3098xxx ,
indicating speciﬁc binding of that radiolabeled
compound. the pancreatic tissue displayed a stable
and fast accumulation of radioactivity from 10 to
30 min p.i.18
unfortunately, the kd value of the ﬂuorine-labeled  xxxd3098xxx  derivative was 2.8-fold decreased versus  xxxd3098xxx  (142 ± 6 and 50 ± 4 nm, respectively; n = 5 each;
p < 0.05) indicating that 18f-derivatization leads to a
decrease of the binding aﬃnity (fig. 1). in order to obtain a compound with higher aﬃnity than the 18f-derivative we synthesized the [11c]methoxy derivative 3 of
 xxxd3098xxx . derivatization in terms of methylation is
supposed to induce less alteration in aﬃnity and pharmacology as compared to ﬂuoroalkylation. with regard
to the 11c-labeling, introduction of a 11c-methyl group
is simpler to handle than a 11c-ethylation, which would
provide the structurally unchanged 11c- xxxd3098xxx .
fortunately, the analogous nonradioactive methoxy
derivative 2 revealed an aﬃnity signiﬁcantly higher
(83 ± 5 nm; n = 5) than the ﬂuorinated derivative
(p < 0.05) and similar to  xxxd3098xxx  itself (fig. 1). the
higher aﬃnity (kd 83 nm vs 142 nm) suggests the 11crepaglinide derivative to be more suitable for receptor
visualization than the 18f-derivative. the shorter physical half-life of 11c (t1/2 = 20 min) in comparison to 18f
(t1/2 = 109 min) does not appear as a drawback since  xxxd3098xxx  rapidly accumulates within the pancreas reaching its maximum 10–30 min p.i.

cos-1 cells transiently expressing human  xxxg19xxx . all incubations were
performed in tris–buﬀer (50 mm, ph 7.4) containing displacing drugs
as indicated. the ic50 values (half-maximally inhibitory concentrations) and hill coeﬃcients are: 106 ± 7 nm, 1.03 ( xxxd3098xxx , h);
163 ± 9 nm, 1.03 (methoxy- xxxd3098xxx , ); 281 ± 11 nm, 1.01 (ﬂuoroethylated  xxxd3098xxx , s). in parallel controls displacement by
unlabelled  xxxd2215xxx  was assessed (ic50 = 0.61 ± 0.03 nm, hill
coeﬃcient = 1.00, data not shown). results shown as mean ± sem
(n = 5). kds were calculated from ic50 values as described.23

a 11c-labeled  xxxd3098xxx  derivative with high speciﬁc
activity might thus become a valuable tracer probe for
the visualization and quantiﬁcation of human pancreatic
b-cell mass in vivo.
1. chemistry
the nonradioactive ôstandardõ compound (s)-2-(methoxy)-4-[3-methyl-1-(2-piperidine-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl]- xxxd306xxx  (methoxy- xxxd3098xxx ) (2),19
required for in vitro evaluation and analytical purposes,
was synthesized from the precursor (s)-2-hydroxy-4-([3methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butylcarbamoyl]-methyl)- xxxd306xxx  methyl ester (1) and methyliodide in
reﬂuxing acetone with k2co3 as a base following a similar procedure as described previously (fig. 2).18 finally,
the methylester moiety was cleaved with naoh (1 n) in

b. wängler et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 14 (2004) 5205–5209

reﬂuxing methanol. enantiomeric purity was proven by
chiral high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) (fig. 2).
for radioactive synthesis, the 11c isotope was produced
via the 14n(p,a)11c nuclear reaction. the [11c]methyliodide was synthesized with an automated synthesis module (pettrace mei microlab, ge medical systems)
within 12 min. to 1 (2.1 mg, 4.8 lmol) dissolved in
250–350 ll dmf, 1 n naoh solution was added
(4.8 ll, 4.8 lmol) and the mixture was heated at
100 c for 1 min. a solution of [11c]methyliodide (1.9–
2.2 gbq) in dmf (350–450 ll) was added and stirred
in a sealed reaction vessel at 100 c for 2.5 min. the
intermediate product was puriﬁed with hplc (acetonitrile/0.1 m acetic acid/na acetate buﬀer (ph = 5) 8:2,
ﬂow rate 4 ml/min, tr = 10.5 min).20 after diluting the
hplc fraction containing the product with 15 ml
water, it was loaded on a c18-seppac cartridge (waters)
during 7 min, washed with 2 ml water, dried with nitrogen for 1 min and eluted with 1.5 ml ethanol to yield the
intermediate (s)-2-([11c]methoxy)-4-[3-methyl-1-(2-piperidine-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl]-benzoic
acid
methyl ester. 1 n naoh solution was added (100 ll,
100 lmol) and stirred in a sealed reaction vessel at
100 c for 10 min. the mixture was neutralized with
1 m hcl (100 ll, 100 lmol). the product was puriﬁed
by diluting with 15 ml water, loading on a c18-seppac
cartridge (waters), drying with nitrogen for 1 min and
eluting with 1 ml warm ethanol to yield 220–250 mbq
of the product. dilution with physiological saline and
sterile ﬁltration gave the injectable solution for in vivo
experiments. the amount of physiological saline was adjusted so that 100 mbq of the product were dissolved in
2 ml solution and the ﬁnal ethanol concentration was
below 5%. hplc analysis showed a radiochemical purity of >99%. the novel radiotracer was obtained in an
overall radiochemical yield of 35% with a speciﬁc activity of 40–70 gbq/lmol, determined via a uv calibration
curve. enantiomeric purity was determined according
to grell et al.21 to ensure that the ester hydrolysis
does not aﬀect the enantiomeric purity. the 11c-methylation is obviously much easier to perform than the previously published 18f-ﬂuoroalkylation probably due the
better leaving group properties of iodine. furthermore,
a 11c-methylation is sterically less challenging than
a 18f-ﬂuoroethylation, which makes the synthesis of 3
easier to perform.

were performed as described.23,24 brieﬂy, cos-1 cells
cultured in dmem hg (10 mm glucose), supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs), were plated at a density
of 5 · 105 cells per dish (94 mm) and allowed to attach

 xxxg19xxx  complementary dna (genbank  xxxg19xxx )
were used to transfect 10 plates. for transfection, the
cells were incubated 4 h in a tris–buﬀered salt solution
containing dna (5–10 lg/ml) plus deae-dextran
(1 mg/ml), 2 min in hepes–buﬀered salt solution plus
 xxxd1896xxx  (10%) and 4 h in dmem-hg plus
chloroquine (100 lm). cells were then returned to
dmem-hg plus 10% fcs and were used 60–72 h
post-transfection to prepare membranes as described.23
to measure binding to membranes from cos-cells,
the resuspended fraction (ﬁnal protein concentration 550 lg/ml) was incubated in ôtris–buﬀerõ (50 mm,
ph 7.4) containing [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (ﬁnal concentration 0.3 nm, nonspeciﬁc binding deﬁned by 1 lm  xxxd2215xxx ) and either methoxy- xxxd3098xxx  2,  xxxd3098xxx 
or unlabeled  xxxd2215xxx . incubations were carried
out for 1 h at room temperature and were terminated
by rapid ﬁltration through whatman gf/b ﬁlters.
half-maximally inhibitory drug concentrations (ic50
values) and hill coeﬃcients (n) were estimated by ﬁtting
the function b = 1/(1 + ([drug]/ic50)n) to the data of
each single displacement experiment. kds were calculated from ic50 values as described.23 data shown as
means ± s.e.m. unlabeled  xxxd3098xxx , its methoxy
derivative 2 and ﬂuoroethyl derivative induced complete
monophasic inhibition curves with hill coeﬃcients close
to 1 yielding dissociation constants (kd) of 53, 83, and
142, respectively (fig. 1).
for testing the in vitro function of 2, a standardized
batch stimulation was performed according to a protocol established in our laboratory.14,25 adult rat islets
were isolated by collagenase digestion and puriﬁed by
a density gradient. brieﬂy, sprague dawley rats (central
animal facility, university of mainz), 6–8 weeks old
and with a body weight of 250–270 g, were used as islet
donors. rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal
pentobarbital administration (60 mg/kg). a midline
abdominal incision was performed and the pancreas
was exposed and injected via the pancreatic duct with
hanksõ  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss; gibco brl, long
island, ny) containing 1.7 mg/ml collagenase (serva
panplus, heidelberg, germany). after the death of the
animals, the pancreatic tissue was surgically removed

and incubated for 10 min at 37 c in the collagenase
solution. mechanical disruption of the digested pancreatic tissue was achieved by further incubation at 37 c
for 10 min in collagenase solution, interrupted every
2 min by shaking for 30 s. the digestion process was
stopped by the addition of cooled hbss plus 10% fetal
calf serum (4 c). islet puriﬁcation was achieved using a
discontinuous three-phase  xxxd3253xxx  density gradient (densities: 1.090, 1.077, and 1.040). islets were cultured in
rpmi medium (biochrom kg, berlin, germany) at
37 c. the medium contained 5.1 mmol/l (1 g/l) d -glucose, 25 mmol/l hepes, 10% fetal calf serum (greiner
laboratories, frickenhausen, germany), 0.2 g/l glutamax (gibcobrl, paisley, scotland) and antibiotics
(100 units/ml penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin; gibcobrl, paisley, scotland and 10 lg/ml  xxxd1706xxx ;
bayer, leverkusen, germany). for each sample, 10
islets were picked (equal in size and shape) in a culture-insert with a membrane of 12 lm pore size (millicell
pcf, millipore, france) and incubated in a 24-well culture-plate (falcon multiwell, becton dickinson, usa).
first, basal insulin secretion was tested by incubating
the islets with normo-glycemic culture media (rpmi
1640 + d -glucose 1 g/l + 10% fcs) for 1 h at 37 c.
after the culture period, the media were collected and
stored at 20 c. the inserts with islets were transferred
to normo-glycemic culture-medium containing 0.10 lm
of  xxxd3098xxx  or its methoxy derivative 2 and incubated
for a stimulation period of 1 h. as a positive control,
several inserts with islets were cultured in hyperglycemic
culture-medium (rpmi 1640 d -glucose 15 mm + 10%
fcs) only. for negative control, normo-glycemic
culture-medium (rpmi 1640 d -glucose 5 mm + 10%
fcs) lacking  xxxd3098xxx  or its methoxy derivative 2
was used. the insulin content of each probe was quantiﬁed by a rat-insulin elisa (mercodia, uppsala,
sweden). insulin secretion was expressed as insulin release per islet/h. the stimulation index (table 1) was calculated by dividing insulin output during stimulation
(15 mm d -glucose or 5 mm d -glucose + test substance)
by insulin secretion during basal incubation (5 mm d glucose). the relative stimulation index was calculated
by dividing insulin output during stimulation with
5 mm d -glucose + test substance by insulin secretion
during incubation with 15 mm d -glucose *100. the increase of insulin secretion after stimulation with compound 2 was determined to be 2.0 ± 0.4 ng/islet/h and
was in the same range as that of  xxxd3098xxx 
(1.9 ± 0.4 ng/islet/h) (table 1). these results indicate that
the described derivatization of  xxxd3098xxx  does not alter
its insulin-stimulating properties.

3. conclusion
[11c]methoxy- xxxd3098xxx  (3), a derivative of the sur
speciﬁc ligand  xxxd3098xxx  was synthesized as an enantiomerically pure compound with an overall radiochemical yield of 35% after 55 min with a radiochemical
purity >99% (n = 8). the radioactive synthesis is easy
to perform and the simple labeling with [11c]methyliodide is an advantage in comparison to a possible
11
c- ethylation for obtaining the structurally unchanged
 xxxd3098xxx . in comparison to 18f-labeled  xxxd3098xxx ,
the synthesis is more comfortable due to the availability of [11c]methyliodide via a commercially available
synthesis module. in vitro evaluation studies of the nonradioactive methoxy analog 2 showed that this compound binds with high aﬃnity to the human  xxxg19xxx 
receptor of the pancreas and biological activity was totally retained as proven by insulin secretion experiments.
thus, further evaluations with [11c]methoxy- xxxd3098xxx 
are planned to elucidate its use for scientiﬁc and clinical
studies using quantitative pet, although the imaging of
b-cell loss is problematic due to the fainting imaging signal with progressing disease.
