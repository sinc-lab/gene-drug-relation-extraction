a b s t r a c t
to investigate the inhibitory proﬁles of  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors on matrix
metalloproteinase-9 ( xxxg1440xxx ) activity, the inhibitory activity and molecular interaction of captopril on
human  xxxg1440xxx  were studied. plasma  xxxg1440xxx  and ace activities in samples from patient with acute
myocardial infarction were similarly inhibited by captopril. molecular models showed that captopril directly
bound to the  xxxg1440xxx  active center. compared with the other ace inhibitors, the compact structure of
captopril seemed to make the inhibitory proﬁles on the  xxxg1440xxx  active site.

1. introduction
matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-9 is a zn2+-dependent endopeptidase. clinically,  xxxg1440xxx  activity is markedly increased during the
acute phase after myocardial infarction (kai et al., 1998). after
myocardial infarction, cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular dilatation are signiﬁcantly suppressed by  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition, as well as in
 xxxg1440xxx  null mice (lindsey et al., 2002, 2006). therefore,  xxxg1440xxx 
inhibition is considered to be useful for decreasing cardiac dysfunction
and left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. however,
these reports evaluated the effect of  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition on cardiac
dysfunction 1 week or several weeks after myocardial infarction
(lindsey et al., 2002, 2006). we recently reported that  xxxg1440xxx  activity
was signiﬁcantly increased 1 day after myocardial infarction in
hamsters, and suggested that lisinopril and imidpril, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, might directly inhibit  xxxg1440xxx 
activity (takai et al., 2007; yamamoto et al., 2007b). in clinical studies,
ace inhibitors have been found to signiﬁcantly reduce the onset and
mortality of myocardial infarction; this effect may be the result of
inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  during the very acute phase after myocardial
infarction (yusuf et al., 2000; blood pressure lowering treatment
trialists' collaboration, 2007).
we recently found that lisinopril and imidapril can be stabilized in
the  xxxg1440xxx  active site; its hydrophobic group appears to preferentially
interact with the s1 site compared with the s1' site (yamamoto et al.,

2007a,b). to investigate the structural differences among ace
inhibitors and their effects on  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitory activity, captopril,
which has the smallest structure among the inhibitors, was used here.
captopril does not have a large hydrophobic moiety such as the phenyl
ethyl group of lisinopril and imidapril (kim et al., 2003), and it would
not be expected to interact with the active site. in this study, the
inhibitory effect of captopril on  xxxg1440xxx  activity in the plasma of
patients during the very acute phase after myocardial infarction was
studied, and molecular models for captopril at the  xxxg1440xxx  active site

fig. 1. effects of captopril on ace (a) and mmp (b) activities in plasma. to conﬁrm the
inhibitory effects of an ace inhibitor on ace and  xxxg1440xxx  activities in human plasma, the
plasma was incubated with captopril for 1 h at 37 °c. (a) ace activity in plasma was
measured using a synthetic substrate  xxxg1042xxx . (b)  xxxg1440xxx  activity in plasma was assayed
using the  xxxg1440xxx  activity assay system.

were constructed. based on these results and our previous studies
(takai et al., 2007; yamamoto et al., 2007a,b), the differences in the
inhibitory effects of captopril and other ace inhibitors on the  xxxg1440xxx 
activity are discussed.
2. materials and methods
2.1. inhibitory effects of captopril on ace and  xxxg1440xxx  activities
blood samples were obtained from 6 patients who had on acute
myocardial infarction. the blood samples were centrifuged at 800 g at
4 °c and plasma samples were obtained. ace activity in plasma was
measured using a synthetic substrate, hippuryl-his-leu ( xxxg1042xxx ),
speciﬁcally designed for ace (peptide institute, inc., osaka, japan)
(furubayashi et al., 2007). fifty microliters of tissue extract was

incubated for 30 min at 37 °c with 5 mumol/l  xxxg1042xxx  in 250 mul of 10 mmol/l
phosphate buffer, ph 8.3, containing 0.3 mol/l nacl. the reaction was
terminated by the addition of 750 mul of 3% metaphosphoric acid. then,
the mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 5 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was applied to a reversed-phase column (4 mm i.d. × 250 mm;
irica instrument, kyoto, japan), which had been equilibrated with
10 mumol/l kh2po4 and ch3oh (1:1, ph 3.0), and eluted with the same
solution at a rate of 0.3 ml/min. hippuric acid was detected by
ultraviolet absorbance at 228 nm. one unit of ace activity was deﬁned
as the amount of enzyme that cleaved 1 mumol of hippuric acid/min.
 xxxg1440xxx  activity in plasma was assayed using  xxxg1440xxx  activity assay
system (amersham biosciences co, piscataway, nj). to conﬁrm the
inhibitory effects on ace and  xxxg1440xxx  activities in plasma, the plasma
samples were treated with nh2–ph–hg–ac (apma), and then were
incubated with captopril for 1 h at 37 °c.

2.2. molecular modeling of the complex formed between captopril and
the  xxxg1440xxx  active domain
to construct  xxxg1440xxx  molecular models complexed with captopril,
the molecular structure of the human  xxxg1440xxx  active domain was
prepared from the coordinate sets of 1gkc chain a (rowsell et al.,
2002) in the protein data bank (pdb) including ca2+ and zn2+ ions and
crystal water molecules. to create the initial models for the complex,
several orientations of the inhibitor were considered; we applied
100 iterations of randomly docking, using a package for molecular
structure analyses, moe (molecular operating environment, chemical
computing group inc., québec, ca http://www.chemcomp.com/).
structural optimization based on energy minimization and 100picosecond molecular dynamics simulation was done as described in
our previous analyses (yamamoto et al., 2007a,b), with a distance
restraint between the captopril s atom and the zn2+ ion of  xxxg1440xxx 
active center similar to that of the x-ray structure of ace–captopril
complex (pdb code: 1uzf) (natesh et al., 2004). the most stable
structure of each model during the simulations was optimized by
energy minimization. all modeling operations were performed using
moe.
3. results
3.1. inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  activity by captopril
captopril inhibited ace activity in a dose-dependent manner at
doses from 1 mumol/l to 100 mumol/l (ic50; 45 nmol/l), and it also
dose dependently inhibited  xxxg1440xxx  activity at the same dose level
(ic50; 87 nmol/l). both dose–response curves are shown in fig. 1. these
results showed that captopril had a high ability to inhibit  xxxg1440xxx 
activity in the plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction,
although captopril was designed for ace but not for  xxxg1440xxx .
3.2. possible modes of interaction between captopril and  xxxg1440xxx  active
site
molecular models were constructed for the  xxxg1440xxx –captopril
complex using randomly docking and structural optimization. of the
100 optimized structures from the docking studies, 3 typical
interaction modes are shown in fig. 2: mode-a and mode-b are
similar to the orientations of lisinopril and imidapril in our previous
studies (yamamoto et al., 2007a,b), and mode-c interacts weakly with
the phe110 residue in the active site. these ﬁndings showed that
captopril could bind to the  xxxg1440xxx  active site directly without
molecular distortion. however, the inhibitory speciﬁcity of captopril
was not selective, except for the binding to the active center.
4. discussion
in our previous studies, we suggested that a hydrophobic
interaction at the active site involving cleavage of the phe110 residue
was important for the stabilization of hydrophobic groups of lisinopril
and imidapril (yamamoto et al., 2007a,b). compared with these ace
inhibitors, captopril was ﬂexible in binding to the  xxxg1440xxx  active site,
and hydrophobic interaction with the active site seemed to be not vital
for binding (fig. 2). the molecular structures of mode-a and mode-b
could be formed whether or not the phe110 residue was present in the
active site, because of the compact structure of captopril. captopril
appears to inhibit plasma  xxxg1440xxx  activity activated by apma in
patients during the acute stage of myocardial infarction, as described
above (fig. 1). lisinopril and imidapril have also been shown to inhibit
 xxxg1440xxx  activity of the left ventricle during the acute stage of myo-

279

cardial infarction (takai et al., 2007; yamamoto et al., 2007b; jin et al.,
2007), but their  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitory activities in plasma are signiﬁcantly
weak (data not shown).
these differences in  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitory pattern between the
various ace inhibitors may be caused by differences in the mechanism
of  xxxg1440xxx  activation. among the  xxxg1440xxx  activators in human body,
chymase has been reported to cleave the peptide bond between
phe110 and glu111 (fang et al., 1997) and to play an important role in
myocardial infarction via this activation and angiotensin-ii production
(jin et al., 2002). in a contrast, the peptide bond between ala93 and
met94 was cleaved by apma treatment in the  xxxg1440xxx  activity assay
system (okada et al., 1992). the difference in  xxxg1440xxx  cleavages needed
for activation seemed to be one of the factors in the complex pattern of
the inhibitory activity.  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition by ace inhibitors, except for
captopril, might be affected by the subtle changes of the active site,
such as the disappearance of phe110 by chymase. we think that this
point is important for the development of  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitors that
could be effective for the treatment of myocardial infarction.
