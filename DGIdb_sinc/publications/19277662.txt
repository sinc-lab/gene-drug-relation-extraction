abstract
purpose the dynamic instability of microtubules in cells
is one of the key targets of anticancer therapeutics. microtubule-disrupting agents such as vinca alkaloids and microtubule-stabilizing agents such as taxanes are important
antitumor agents. the bone marrow toxicity and human
tumor xenograft activity of three tubulin-binding compounds, vincristine, paclitaxel, and tasidotin were compared.
methods mouse and human bone marrow were subjected
to colony-forming (cfu-gm) assays over a 5-log concentration range in culture. in vivo, a range of tasidotin doses
was compared with vincristine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel
for eycacy in several human tumor xenografts.
results the ic90 concentrations for vincristine and paclitaxel for mouse cfu-gm were 30 and 27 nm, and for
human cfu-gm were 3 and 9 nm, giving mouse to human
diverentials of ten- and threefold. tasidotin produced ic90s
of >300 nm in mouse and 65 nm in human cfu-gm, thus
a >4.6-fold diverential between species. in vivo, tasidotin
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in tumor growth
delay in the rl lymphoma, the rpmi 8226 multiple
myeloma, and mx-1 breast carcinoma models. vincristine
and tasidotin were also very evective against these tumors.
the pc-3 prostate carcinoma was very responsive to fulldose paclitaxel and docetaxel while tasidotin generated a
dose dependent evect.

introduction
the cellular requirement for the dynamic xux of microtubules is one of the key targets of anticancer therapies.
although principally recognized in mitotic function for
their role in separating the duplicate set of chromosomes
during cell division, microtubules are an essential component of the cytoskeleton and are critical in many interphase
functions including directional transport of proteins and
organelles, maintenance of cell motility, cell shape and
scavolding, intracellular transport, secretion, neurotransmission and relay of signaling between cell surface receptors, and the nucleus [5, 49]. microtubules are polymers
composed of molecules of tubulin which are each dimers of
tightly linked globular protein subunits called - and
-tubulin. the biologic function of microtubules relies on
the unique dynamics of tubulin polymerization [24, 25].
microtubule assembly and disassembly are in dynamic
equilibrium. cells modify the rate of dynamic xux of
microtubules to perform speciwc functions. during mitosis,
the rates of both microtubule assembly and disassembly are
increased so that chromosomes can readily capture microtubules that are actively forming mitotic spindles.
the cytotoxicity of the vinca alkaloid anticancer agents,
vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, and vinxunine, is
caused by their interaction with tubulin and subsequent

123

1030

disruption of microtubules [23, 40]. the stimulation of the
vinca alkaloid-binding site on tubulin suppresses microtubule dynamics (switching between phases of slow growth
and rapid shortening at microtubule ends) and microtubule
treadmilling (initiating growth at the plus end and shortening at the minus end of the microtubules) causing cell cycle
arrest at g2/m [28, 29, 39, 40, 46, 51]. thus, these compounds cause a disruption of microtubules comprising the
mitotic spindle apparatus, thereby inducing metaphase
arrest in dividing cells. the vinca alkaloids also avect
microtubules involved in chemotaxis and directional migration, intracellular transport and movement of organelles
such as mitochondria and secretory granules especially in
neural cells, secretory processes, membrane traycking and
transmission of receptor signals, and structural integrity in
some cells. platelets, in particular, are rich in tubulin and
depend upon microtubules for structure. the relationships
between the inhibitory evects of vinca alkaloid on cell proliferation, mitotic arrest, mitotic spindle disruption, and
depolymerization of microtubules have been described in
detail [3, 19, 54].
the dolastatins are a family of naturally occurring
unique polypeptides containing unusual amino acids [45].
tasidotin is a third-generation synthetic dolastatin  xxxd1841xxx  analog with antitumor activity [6, 9, 10, 14, 27, 37].
in a manner similar to the vinca alkaloids, tasidotin suppresses microtubule spindle dynamics by reducing the rate
of shortening, reducing the switching frequency from
growth to shortening (catastrophe frequency), and reducing
the time of microtubule growth [6, 47].
microtubule-stabilizing agents including taxanes and
epothilones, on the other hand, exert cytotoxicity by stabilizing microtubules [15, 20]. taxanes, speciwcally paclitaxel, was discovered during a nci screen of plant extracts
for anticancer activity. it was later found that paclitaxel is
produced by taxomyces andreanae, a fungal endophyte
endemic to the inner bark of the paciwc yew [52]. the site
of paclitaxel binding on microtubules is diverent from the
binding sites for vinca alkaloids and dolastatins. paclitaxel
binds to the n-terminal 31 amino acids of the -tubulin
subunit in tubulin oligomers or polymers rather than to
tubulin dimers. thus, taxanes shift the dynamic equilibrium
between tubulin dimers and microtubules toward microtubule assembly and stabilize microtubules thus preventing
depolymerization. the taxane-bound microtubules are very
stable and the dynamic reorganization of the microtubule
network is inhibited [48]. taxanes induce microtubule bundling in cells and the formation of numerous abnormal
mitotic asters. at low concentrations, taxanes kill cells by
producing a sustained mitotic block at the metaphase-anaphase boundary which triggers apoptosis. the epothilones
are also microtubule-stabilizing agents which induce
microtubule bundling, formation of multipolar spindles,

123

cancer chemother pharmacol (2009) 64:1029–1038

and mitotic arrest. epothilones and taxanes do not bind to
tubulin polymers in an identical manner [8, 18, 32, 38, 42,
53, 54].
bone marrow is critically sensitive to many antineoplastic agents. [43]. it is important to understand the toxicity of
agents to bone marrow, and to determine whether bone
marrow progenitor cells will have greater or less sensitivity
to the agent than human malignant cells. bone marrow
granulocyte–macrophage-colony forming unit (cfu-gm)
assays that compare the sensitivity of bone marrow cells
across species are useful in predicting the blood levels of an
agent that might be achieved in patients using blood levels
tested in preclinical eycacy and safety studies as a guide.
mouse bone marrow is less sensitive to many cytotoxic
agents than is human bone marrow, allowing blood levels
in preclinical eycacy testing that cannot be achieved in
patients [11, 30, 34, 43]. an eycacious level of a compound with smaller or no diverential in bone marrow progenitor sensitivity among species may have a better
potential for reaching similar blood levels in patients as in
mice. if bone marrow toxicity is dose-limiting, these compounds may be more likely to be successful in reaching
therapeutic doses. pessina et al. [43] suggested that through
use of the ratio of mouse/human cfu-gm ic90 values and
the mouse mtd, the human mtd of a compound could be
predicted and thus the potential for achieving a therapeutic
blood level in patients estimated.
the current report compares the bone marrow cfu-gm
and tumor cell cfu activity of three tubulin binding agents,
vincristine, tasidotin, and paclitaxel. a smaller diverence in
bone marrow cfu-gm cytotoxicity between mouse and
human addresses the practical issue of achieving doses in
the clinic at a level comparable to those wrst tested in preclinical studies. antitumor activity of the compounds in
several xenograft models was assessed using the endpoints
of tumor growth delay and body weight change.

materials and methods
materials
tasidotin hydrochloride (n, n-dimethyl-l-valyl-l-valyln-methyl-l-valyl-l-prolyl- xxxd2434xxx -tert-butylamide hydrochloride) was available in-house as a stable white solid.
aqueous solutions remain stable with maximum stability of
aqueous solutions occurring at ph 5.0 in a phosphate
buvered solution. tasidotin was prepared as a 10-mm stock
solution in pbs. paclitaxel (#t1912) and vincristine
(#v8879) were purchased from sigma chemicals (st. louis,
mo). paclitaxel was prepared as a 10-mm stock solution
in dmso (sigma, #d5879). vincristine was prepared as a
10-mm stock solution in distilled water. for cell culture,

cancer chemother pharmacol (2009) 64:1029–1038

aliquots (10 l) were made in sterile, capped polypropylene
tubes and stored frozen at ¡20°c until use.
for colony-forming assays, a single aliquot of each compound was thawed the day of the assay, and a working
stock of 10 m was made from 5 l of the 10 mm drug into
5 ml rpmi1640/5% fbs. dilutions of 20£ the desired
wnal concentration were prepared from this working stock
solution in rpmi1640/5% fbs.
for xenograft studies, vincristine, docetaxel, and paclitaxel were purchased from sigma chemicals. tasidotin was
prepared in normal saline. compounds were prepared
freshly for injection into mice. compounds were administered in volumes of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. vincristine
was prepared in normal saline. docetaxel was reconstituted
in 13% ethanol for a 10 mg/ml stock solution and then further diluted with normal saline. paclitaxel was reconstituted
at 6 mg/ml in 1:1 cremophor el:ethanol and then further
diluted with normal saline.
mouse bone marrow
male balb/c mice were purchased from charles river laboratories (wilmington, ma) at 6–8 weeks of age and used
for studies  xxxd2274xxx –10 weeks of age. the mice were housed
four to eight per cage, had free access to tap water, were fed
a normal diet and observed daily. the procedures were carried out according to a protocol approved by the institutional animal care and use committee in accordance with
the federal animal welfare act (9 cfr, 1992) and were
conducted in an aaalac accredited facility.
for bone marrow collection, naïve mice were killed by
asphyxiation through inhalation of carbon dioxide. to
ensure a sterility of the bone marrow, the killed donor
mouse was placed in a biological laminar xow hood and the
whole body was sprayed with a 70%  xxxd102xxx . a
skin incision was made throughout the whole hind limb
from mid-point of inguinal ligament to the medial side of
the foot. the muscle and other connective tissues were
removed and both tibias and the femurs were extracted. the
bone medullary cavity was accessed by removing the
epiphysis of the tibia or the femur located at the end of long
bones. a blunt syringe needle (27g) was inserted into the
medullary cavity and the cavity was xushed with 2 ml of
sterile rpmi1640/5% fbs until the color of bone shaft
became pale indicating removal of the bone marrow. the
resulting cellular suspension was collected into a 50-ml
conical-bottom tube and kept on wet ice. approximately 25
million cells were obtained from each mouse [31].
bone marrow cfu-gm assay
for mouse cfu-gm assays, freshly isolated mouse bone
marrow cells were cultured in methocult (#m3534)

1031

containing the cytokines rm scf, rm  xxxg1177xxx , and rh il-6 to
assist growth (stemcell technologies, vancouver, bc).
for human cfu-gm assays, viable human bone marrow
cells (purchased as frozen vials from all cells, llc via
stemcell technologies, #abm009) were prepared with a
dnase treatment (#07900, stemcell technologies),
washed in a protocol described by the vendor, and cultured.
the culture medium used was methocult gf (#h4534),
containing the cytokines hscf, hgm-csf, hil-3 (stemcell technologies).
both the human and mouse methocult mediums were
received frozen in 100 ml volumes. upon receipt, bottles
were thawed overnight at 4°c, and divided into 3 ml aliquots in sterile 15 ml tubes the methocult mediums solidify at 37°c, and were not warmed to greater than room
temperature until the addition of cells and compounds
immediately prior to transfer to 37°c. the methocult
medium aliquots were refrozen at ¡20°c until thawing at
4°c overnight before the assay.
for experiments, 150 l of 20£ concentration of the
compounds, along with 150 l of a suspension of mouse or
human bone marrow cells, were added to the 3-ml tube of
thawed methocult medium and vigorously mixed by vortex. final cell concentrations were 4 £ 104 cells/plate for
mouse cells, 8 £ 104 cells/plate for human cells. tubes
were then allowed to sit undisturbed for 10–15 min until
the air bubbles dissipated. a blunt needle attached to a 3-ml
syringe was used to collect 2.5 ml of the cell suspension,
the air was voided from the syringe, and 1 ml of cell suspension was placed in the center of duplicate treatmentlabeled 100 cm2 culture dishes. dishes were gently rotated
to allow even coverage of the bottom surface of each dish
and then placed in a 37°c incubator for colony formation
for 13 days for mouse bone marrow and 15 days for human
bone marrow. colonies were dewned as clusters containing
30 or more cells.
human and mouse bone marrow progenitor cells were
continuously exposed to a concentration range of vincristine, paclitaxel, or tasidotin in three independent cfu-gm
colony formation experiments. the compound concentrations were made in half-log intervals covering 5 logs (10
concentrations). the ic50 and ic90 values and the 95% conwdence interval for each compound for human and mouse
bone marrow were determined by non-linear regression
analysis [31].
tumor lines
the rl lymphoma is a mature, ebv-negative, cd20+ b
cell line from a divuse large-cell lymphoma and carries a
chromosomal marker t(14, 18)(q32;q21) [2]. the rpmi
8226 line is a b lymphocyte plasmacytoma, a cell line
established from a 61-year-old male in the mid-1960s [35].

123

1032

the cell line is most often described as multiple myeloma.
the nci-h460 large cell lung carcinoma was derived in
1982 from the pleural evusion xuid of a male patient with
large cell lung cancer [1]. the human pc-3 prostate carcinoma line was developed from a bone metastasis of a grade
iv prostate adenocarcinoma from a 62-year-old patient
[26]. the pc-3 line is androgen independent, exhibits low
acid phosphatase, and testosterone-5-alpha reductase activities. the mx-1 human mammary xenograft tumor was
developed by dr. a. a. ovejera [41]. the original human
xenograft was established from a 29-year-old female
patient with no previous therapy and the tumor was diagnosed histologically as poorly diverentiated inwltrating duct
cell carcinoma.
human tumor xenografts
the eycacy of vincristine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and tasidotin was compared in human tumor xenograft studies. all
procedures were carried out according to a protocol
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee in accordance with the federal animal welfare act
(9 cfr, 1992) and were conducted in an aaalac accredited facility. prior to eycacy testing, the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of each compound was determined by the
method described by corbett et al. [7]. scid mice from
frederick cancer research and development center
(frederick, md) or nu/nu mice from harlan sprague
dawley (indianapolis, in) were implanted subcutaneously
with a 4-mg tumor fragment, and treatments were initiated
when tumors reached 100–200 mm3. at the time the tumor
volumes reached 100–200 mm3, the animals were pairmatched into treatment (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10).
for experiments with the human rl lymphoma, rpmi
8226 multiple myeloma, mx-1 breast carcinoma, pc-3 prostate carcinoma or nci-h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma
xenograft, vincristine (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) was administered by
intravenous injection into a tail vein on alternate days for wve
injections, docetaxel (20 or 12 mg/kg) was administered by
intravenous injection into a tail vein on alternate days for three
injections, and paclitaxel (20 or 10 mg/kg) was administered
by intravenous injection into a tail vein on alternate days for
three injections. tasidotin (120, 100, 80 or 40 mg/kg) was
administered by intraperitoneal injection daily for 5 days.
tumor volumes were calculated using the formula
(w2 £ l)/2 where ‘w’ is the width of the tumor and ‘l’ is the
length of the tumor. individual mice were weighed and
tumor measurements taken by calipers twice weekly. the
data are presented as mean tumor volume § sem. mice
were euthanized when the tumors reached a predetermined
volume. tumor growth delay was obtained by determining
the diverence between treatment and control group mean
tumor growth in days at a predetermined tumor volume.

results
the compounds vincristine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and tasidotin are potent cytotoxic agents for both mouse, and
human bone marrow cfu-gm (fig. 1). exposure to the
compounds produced killing of cells in an exponential
manner. the concentration response curves are shown in
fig. 2. for all compounds tested, concentrations killing 50
and 90% of the cells were achieved or nearly achieved.
human and mouse bone marrow cfu-gm ic50 concentrations were two- to threefold lower than the corresponding
ic90 concentrations; thus the concentration response curves
for these compounds are very steep, consistent with strong
binding to a critical target in the cells (table 1). human
bone marrow cfu-gm was more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of the compounds than was mouse bone marrow
cfu-gm.
vincristine was a more potent cytotoxic agent than paclitaxel or tasidotin toward human bone marrow cfu-gm
and had the largest diverential between cytotoxicity toward
mouse bone marrow cfu-gm and human bone marrow
cfu-gm. the ratios of the mouse and human bone marrow cfu-gm at the ic50 and ic90 concentrations were calculated (table 1). for vincristine and tasidotin, the ratios
were greater than or equal to 10 and for paclitaxel the ratios
were two- and threefold.

with no observable body weight loss at the dose tested
(table 2).
in the human mx-1 breast carcinoma xenograft, docetaxel (12 mg/kg), and vincristine (1 mg/kg) administration
each resulted in tumor growth delays of ¸50 days (fig. 4).

in this model, as docetaxel is an fda-approved treatment
for breast cancer as a single agent. paclitaxel (10 mg/kg)
was less evective resulting in a tumor growth delay of
13.5 days in this tumor. tasidotin had a dose-dependent
evect with 26.5 and 21 days of tumor growth delay at doses
of 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively (fig. 4). a dose of
12 mg/kg docetaxel produced a body weight loss of 7.7%,
while a dose of 1 mg/kg vincristine produced severe body
weight loss, reaching a maximum of 23.9%. paclitaxel at
10 mg/kg resulted in a maximal body weight loss of 4.0%,
and there were no body weight loss produced by tasidotin
treatment at 100 or 50 mg/kg (table 2).
the human pc-3 prostate carcinoma xenograft was also
responsive to the tubulin binding agents (fig. 5). in this
model, docetaxel (20 mg/kg) at full dose produced a tumor
growth delay >70 days while a dose of 12 mg/kg of docetaxel produced 28.5 days of tumor growth delay. a full
dose of paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) resulted in 46.5 days of
tumor growth delay. tasidotin showed a dose-dependent
evect on tumor growth delay resulting in 23 days and
17 days of tumor growth delay with doses of 100 and
50 mg/kg of tasidotin, respectively. combination regimens
including tasidotin and docetaxel were also tested. the
combination of tasidotin (100 mg/kg) along with docetaxel
(12 mg/kg) resulted in 41 days of tumor growth delay
which was greater than the tumor response from docetaxel
(12 mg/kg) alone while the combination of tasidotin
(50 mg/kg) with docetaxel (12 mg/kg) resulted in 26 days
of tumor growth delay which was not diverent from
docetaxel (12 mg/kg) alone. treatment with tasidotin was
well tolerated with no body weight loss at the 50 mg/kg
dose and 2.4% body weight loss at the 100 mg/kg dose. a
maximal body weight loss of 8.8% occurred with docetaxel
at 12 mg/kg. the group treated with a combination of

14.3% for 50 mg/kg tasidotin plus 12 mg/kg docetaxel, and
20.7% for 100 mg/kg tasidotin plus 12 mg/kg docetaxel.
the higher dose of docetaxel, 20 mg/kg, caused a body
weight loss of 24.5%. the paclitaxel dose of 20 mg/kg was
well tolerated, with a body weight loss of 1.0% (table 2).
the human nci-h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma
was less responsive to the tubulin binders than were the
other human tumor xenografts tested. a full dose regimen
of docetaxel (20 mg/kg) produced 23 days of tumor growth
delay in the nci-h460 lung while the lower dose regimen
of 12 mg/kg resulted in 18.5 days of tumor growth delay in
this tumor (fig. 6). the nci-h460 non-small cell lung
carcinoma was also less responsive to tasidotin with 7 and
4 days of tumor growth delay resulting from administration
of 100 and 50 mg/kg of tasidotin, respectively. combination regimens were also tested in the nci-h460 tumor
model. the combinations of tasidotin (100 or 50 mg/kg)
along with docetaxel (12 mg/kg) resulted in tumor
responses that were not diverent from docetaxel (12 mg/kg)

maximal body weight loss of 4.2% at the 100-mg/kg dose
and 2.8% at the 50-mg/kg dose. severe body weight loss
was exhibited in the mice receiving docetaxel, with a maximal body weight loss of 24.5% at the 20-mg/kg dose and
17.4% at the 12-mg/kg dose. tasidotin did not increase the
body weight loss when used in combination with docetaxel.
a maximal body weight loss of 10.1% occurred with paclitaxel treatment at 20 mg/kg (table 2).

discussion
bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage-colony forming
unit (cfu-gm) assays comparing the sensitivity of bone
marrows across species have been useful in predicting the
blood levels of agents that might be tolerated in patients
compared with blood levels in preclinical eycacy and
safety species [43]. for many cytotoxic agents, the bone

123

1036

marrow of mice is less sensitive than is human bone marrow, thus allowing blood levels to be achieved in preclinical eycacy testing that cannot be reached in patients. the
toxicity of three tubulin binding agents was examined for
murine and human bone marrow progenitor cells (table 1)
[11, 30, 34, 43]. the diverential sensitivity between the
cells from these two species to the tubulin binders may
explain, in part, the diverence in evects of these compounds
in patients compared to preclinical studies. the corollary is
that compounds with smaller or no diverential in bone
marrow progenitor sensitivity amongst species may have a
better potential for reaching similar blood levels in patients
as in mice. if bone marrow toxicity is dose-limiting in
patients, compounds with smaller diverences in bone marrow toxicity would more likely be successful in reaching
therapeutic doses. paclitaxel has the smallest diverence in
the ic90 value between human and mouse bone marrow and
has been a very useful clinical antitumor agent for the treatment of many tumor types [13, 33, 55]. pessina et al. [43]
reported paclitaxel ic50 and ic90 values in the mouse of
0.004 and 0.007 g/ml which compare very well with the
values from the current study of 0.009 and 0.023 g/ml,
respectively. similarly, pessina et al. [43] reported paclitaxel ic50 and ic90 values for human bone marrow cfugm of 0.0039 and 0.00061 g/ml which compare favorably
with the values from the current study of 0.0039 and
0.0076 g/ml. pessina et al. [43] went further to suggest
that through use of the ratio between mouse and human
cfu-gm ic90 values as well as the maximum tolerated
dose of the compound in mice, the maximum tolerated dose
of the compound in patients could be predicted and a therapeutic blood level in patients estimated.
each of the tubulin-binding agents studied has been
used in the clinic; thus, the normal tissue adverse reactions upon administration of each of these agents to
patients are known. the most frequent serious adverse
event upon treatment with vincristine is the development
of neurologic side evects. first, sensory impairment and
parasthesia may occur. as treatment continues, neurotic
pain and motor diyculties develop. some neuromuscular
complications may persist for prolonged periods post
therapy in some patients [36, 57, 58]. serious bone marrow depletion is usually not a major dose-limiting toxicity
with vincristine treatment. however, leukopenia, anemia,
and thrombocytopenia have been reported. peripheral
neuropathy may develop in patients receiving escalating
doses of vincristine. on the other hand, 90% of patients
treated with paclitaxel also develop some hematologic
toxicity including neutropenia, leucopenia, and anemia
[13, 33, 55]. serious neutropenia (anc < 500/mm3;
grade 4) occurs in about 52% of patients and anemia in
about 78% of patients receiving paclitaxel symptoms of
peripheral neuropathy are seen in 60% of patients as well

123

cancer chemother pharmacol (2009) 64:1029–1038

as myalgia and arthralgia. about 52% of patients treated
with paclitaxel also experience gastrointestinal distress
[4, 12]. docetaxel administration produces neutropenia in
essentially all patients treated and grade 4 neutropenia
occurs in about 80% of patients. virtually all patients
treated with docetaxel also experience leucopenia and
anemia caused by the drug. about 50% of patients treated
with docetaxel experience xuid retention. severe neurosensory symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were
observed in about 5% patients treated with docetaxel. the
major dose limiting toxicities associated with administration of tasidotin to patients are hematologic, especially
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [37]. severe neutropenia occurred in 44% of patients receiving tasidotin.
dose-related non-hematologic toxicities were mainly
gastrointestinal including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea;
fatigue also occurred frequently [37]. the principal
toxicity of tasidotin is neutropenia that is similar to other
clinical agents which interfere with microtubule dynamics
[9, 10, 27, 37]. interestingly, neurotoxicity, which occurs
often with the taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and epothilones,
was not observed in the early clinical trials of tasidotin
[27, 32].
several pharmacokinetic parameters for the tubulin
inhibitors in patients and mice are compared in table 3 [6,
17, 21, 22, 37, 50, 56]. overall, the concentration needed to
produce the same level of tasidotin-induced bone marrow
cfu-gm killing in mouse bone marrow compared with
human bone marrow is greater than eightfold. the mouse
dose of 120 mg/kg (360 mg/m2) is 7.7-fold higher than the
recommended phase ii dose for tasidotin in patients of
46.8 mg/m2 in very good agreement with the cfu-gm
wndings. at these doses, the cmax and auc for tasidotin in
mice is about 20-fold greater than the cmax and auc in
humans (table 3) [6, 37]. the concentration of paclitaxel
required to produce the same killing of mouse and human
bone marrow cfu-gm divers by two- to threefold and is
the most similar among the group of agents tested. the single mouse dose of paclitaxel is 20 mg/kg. this dose and the
doses of the comparator compounds were determined in
prior mtd experiments in the mouse [7]. by linear extrapolation of the mouse paclitaxel auc data on table 3, the
auc for a 20-mg/kg dose of paclitaxel in the mouse would
be 13,070 ng £ h/ml, which is within the range of the
human auc for 175 mg/m2 of paclitaxel administered as a
3-h infusion [21, 22]. the mtd for a single dose of vincristine in mice is 4–5 mg/kg. by linear extrapolation from the
vincristine auc data on table 3, 4–5 mg/kg of vincristine
would produce an auc of 3,360–4,200 ng £ h/ml, which
is seven- to ninefold greater than the auc for patients
treated with 2 mg/m2 of vincristine. [17, 50, 56]. as with
many anticancer agents, the resilience of the mouse to tasidotin and vincristine allows much greater exposure of

implanted human tumors to the drug molecule in the
murine host than in the human patient.
all of the tubulin-binding agents were active and evective anticancer drugs in the human tumor xenografts examined. vincristine was a very evective anticancer agent in
the rpmi 8226 human multiple myeloma and the mx-1
human breast carcinoma models. the taxanes, paclitaxel,
and docetaxel especially when administered at full dose,
were very evective anticancer agents for treatment of the
solid tumors, mx-1 breast carcinoma, pc-3 prostate carcinoma, and nci-h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma. like
vincristine, tasidotin was most evective in the rpmi 8226
multiple myeloma and mx-1 breast carcinoma models.
the nci-h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma was not
responsive to tasidotin. interestingly, co-administration of
tasidotin and docetaxel to mice bearing the pc-3 prostate
carcinoma or nci-h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma did
not increase the tumor response compared with the
response to the taxane alone. in the xenograft experiments,
administration of tasidotin resulted in lower body weight
losses than did docetaxel.
because of the mouse's greater mtd compared to
humans, the compound doses found to be eycacious in the
mouse may be diycult to achieve in the human. the ratio
of human and mouse bone marrow cfu-gm is a useful
parameter along with preclinical mouse safety and eycacy
results in the translation to the clinic. pessina et al. [43] has
validated a model utilizing the ratio between mouse and
human cfu-gm ic90 values as well as the maximum tolerated dose of the compound in mice to accurately predict the
maximum tolerated dose of the compound in patients and
estimate therapeutic blood levels. the mouse tends to be
more tolerant to xenobiotics than are humans; however,
through the application of translational techniques, more
accurate interpretation of preclinical tumor models may be
achieved in the process of the development of new drugs
[16, 44].
