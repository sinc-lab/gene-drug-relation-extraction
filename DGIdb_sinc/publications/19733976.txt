s u m m a r y
in the recent years, eight  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) have been approved for cancer treatment and
numerous are under investigation. these drugs are rationally designed to target speciﬁc tyrosine kinases
that are mutated and/or over-expressed in cancer tissues. post marketing study commitments have been
made upon (accelerated) approval such as additional pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal- or
hepatic impairment, in children, additional interactions studies and studies on the relative or absolute
bioavailability. therefore, much information will emerge on the pharmacokinetic behavior of these drugs
after their approval.
in the present manuscript, the pharmacokinetic characteristics; absorption, distribution, metabolism
and excretion (adme), of the available tkis are reviewed. results from additional studies on the effect
of drug transporters and drug–drug interactions have been incorporated. overall, the tkis reach their
maximum plasma levels relatively fast; have an unknown absolute bioavailability, are extensively distributed and highly protein bound. the drugs are primarily metabolized by cytochrome p450 (cyp)
3a4 with other cyp-enzymes playing a secondary role. they are predominantly excreted with the feces
and only a minor fraction is eliminated with the urine. all tkis appear to be transported by the efﬂux atp
binding-cassette transports b1 and g2. additionally these drugs can inhibit some of their own metabolizing enzymes and transporters making steady-state metabolism and drug–drug interactions both complex and unpredictable.
by understanding the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of these drugs and their similarities, factors that inﬂuence drug exposure will be better recognized and this knowledge may be used to limit sub- or supra-therapeutic drug exposure.

introduction: rationale behind the development of tkis
in 1960, a minute chromosome, later known as the philadelphia
chromosome, was discovered in human chronic granulocytic
leukemia and a causal relationship was suggested between this
abnormal chromosome and the disease.1–3 later, a translocation
between the long arm of the 22 and the long arm of the 9 chromosome was found which was associated with an altered heavier
human c-abl protein with  xxxg2198xxx  activity and assumingly
a growth stimulating effect.4–6 the group of heisterkamp et al.
discovered the linkage between c-abl, positioned at chromosome
9 and the  xxxg256xxx  (bcr) on chromosome 22
resulting in the bcr-abl oncogene and corresponding protein
supposedly important for the generation and/or maintenance of
the disease.7–10 ninety-ﬁve percent of all chronic myelogenous
leukemia (cml) was suggested to be result of the altered tyrosine

kinase that, under physiological conditions, is under tight control
but in fusion is deregulated and expressed constitutively resulting
in indeﬁnite proliferation.11 the involvement of protein tyrosine
kinase activity in the development of tumors made them interesting targets for selective chemotherapy and thus for rational drug
design. as a result the ﬁrst series of low molecular weight compounds (tyrphostins) that display speciﬁcity for individual tyrosine
kinase receptors were synthesized.12
also a novel compound ( xxxd2332xxx , sti571, imatinib) was
synthesized that speciﬁcally inhibits bcr-abl cell proliferation. it
competes with atp for the atp binding site of the tyrosine kinases.
in in vitro tests imatinib inhibits bcr-abl, c-abl and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (pdgfr)  xxxg2198xxx .13,14 only ﬁve years
after the presentation of the in vitro and animal study data, the
results of the phase i studies were presented.15–17 based on the
results from three additional phase ii studies, the drug that was
rationally designed to inhibit the bcr-abl protein appeared
substantially active and received accelerated approval by the fda
on the 5th of may 2001 for the treatment of three philadelphia
chromosome positive leukemia subtypes.18–20 additionally
imatinib potentially inhibits the kinase activity of the mutated

n.p. van erp et al. / cancer treatment reviews 35 (2009) 692–706

and wild-type c-kit receptor in vitro and an effect on malignancies
that is completely or partly dependent on c-kit activity was
hypothesized and conﬁrmed.21,22 the phase i study, presented in
2001, showed imatinib activity in c-kit receptor positive gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist).23 on the 18th of april 2003 the
registration of imatinib was extended to treatment of patients with
c-kit receptor positive unresectable and/or metastatic gists and
was reassigned to the ﬁrst line treatment of patients with cml in
the chronic phase.24 with the introduction of imatinib a whole
new era of tumor treatment started, with therapy that is rationally
designed and given orally on a daily basis. since the introduction of
imatinib seven additional tkis have been approved (table 1). all
tkis are designed to compete with atp for the atp binding pocket
of similar or different tyrosine kinases that are mutated and/or
over-expressed in speciﬁc tumors.
in this manuscript, we give an overview of the literature
describing the pharmacokinetic characteristics; absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion (adme), of the available
tkis. additionally, results from studies on the effect of drug transporters and drug–drug interactions have been incorporated.
absorption
imatinib
imatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a
peak plasma concentration at 2 h.25 for imatinib, the bioavailability is surprisingly well investigated for a drug with no intravenously registered formulation. the exposure after intravenous
infusion and after intake of oral capsule or solution was measured
to determine the absolute bioavailability.26 the intravenous
formulation was specially made for investigational purposes and
the capsule was used at the time the study was performed. the
later registered tablet formulation was compared to the capsules
to determine the relative bioavailability.27 the bioavailability of
imatinib is 98% which is irrespective of oral formulation (solution, capsule or tablet) or dosage (100 or 400 mg).26–28 imatinib
absorption is not inﬂuenced by food or concomitant antacid
use.29 long-term exposure might inﬂuence the bioavailability
since imatinib inhibits efﬂux transporters (atp binding-cassette
drug transporters;  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx ) and enzymes (cytochrome
p450 3a4 and  xxxg592xxx ) present at the intestinal wall, but conﬂicting data are reported on this matter.30,31 the exact gastrointestinal site of absorption is not known yet. in a case of a woman
with short bowel syndrome only 20% of the imatinib exposure
was measured indicating that absorption takes place over a longer
part of the gastrointestinal tract.32 another case report describes
the absorption from the rectum; the exposure (auc) was approximately 40% of the orally achieved exposure indicating that
absorption of the drug in the rectum takes place.33 the interpatient variability in imatinib clearance is large 40% and mainly
unexplained.34

693

geﬁtinib
the peak plasma levels of geﬁtinib occur within 3–7 h.35 the
absolute bioavailability is 60% in healthy volunteers and cancer
patients.36 administration of a granular formulation, a dispersion
of the classic tablets or administration by nasogastric tube did
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the bioavailability.37,38 food has only a
moderate and clinical non-signiﬁcant effect on geﬁtinib exposure.
data of a study with 50 mg geﬁtinib showed a 14% decrease in
auc, another study with 250 mg of the drug showed a 37% increase
in auc after co-administration with food; this combined with the
large interpatient variability (45–70%) makes the effect of food
negligible.35,36,39
 xxxd2029xxx 
the peak plasma levels of  xxxd2029xxx  occur 4 h after dosing.40 the
bioavailability following a 150 mg dose is 100% when applying a
noncompartmental approach and 60% using a 2-compartiment
nonlinear model.41 the assumed nonlinearity in the compartmental approach is not conﬁrmed by the data from the phase i dose
escalation study.42 food increases the bioavailability to almost
100%.40 since the effect of food on  xxxd2029xxx  exposure is highly variable, the drug should be taken without food.41  xxxd2029xxx  shows a
large interpatient variability (60%) which is unexplained yet.43
sorafenib
the peak plasma levels of sorafenib occurs 3 h after dosing.44
the absolute bioavailability is unknown. the relative bioavailability of tablets compared to oral solution is 38–49%.45 conﬂicting
data are published on the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics
of sorafenib. in the phase i studies no major effect of food was observed.46 however, the fda approval reports a reduction of the
bioavailability of 29% when taken with food and advices to take
sorafenib without food.47 sorafenib pharmacokinetics show a large
interpatient variability.44 the large interpatient variability is supposed to be the result of slow dissolution in the gastrointestinal
tract and enterohepatic circulation.46 the drug shows a less than
proportional increase in exposure with dose escalation. the underlying reason for this nonlinearity is not known yet.46
sunitinib
the maximum plasma concentration of sunitinib is achieved
within 6–12 h and the absolute bioavailability is unknown. the
drug may be taken with or without food since food only has a marginal effect on the exposure.48 the interpatient variability is large
40%.49 a recent case report describes a signiﬁcant decrease in sunitinib exposure (auc) in an obese patient, which might indicate that
body mass index has a pronounced effect on drug exposure and
might thereby explain partly the large interpatient variability.50

 xxxd1815xxx 
the maximum plasma concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  is achieved
within 3–5 h and the bioavailability in humans is unknown. a
14% auc increase may occur in patients taking the drug with a
high-fat meal, however, this effect is not supposed to be clinically
signiﬁcant.51 the interpatient and inter-occasion variability is
large and ranges from 32% to 118%. a substantial proportion of
the inter-occasion variability is supposed be explained by the
bioavailability.52 the origin of the interpatient variability has not
been elucidated yet.
lapatinib
the maximum plasma concentration of lapatinib is achieved
within 3–4 h.53 the absolute bioavailability has not been studied.
however, the bioavailability of the drug must be low since food
has such an extraordinary effect on the bioavailability. the largest
effect is seen with a high-fat meal, which increased the exposure of
lapatinib by 325% while a low-fat meal increased the exposure by
167%.54 possible explanations for this pronounced effect are: (1) a
delayed gastric emptying induced by food allows more time for the
tablets to dissolve and/or (2) food increases the formation of micelles by bile salts of hydrophobic substances such as lapatinib
which might be of great inﬂuence on the bioavailability. food does
not inﬂuence the half life which suggests that the increased
exposure is mainly caused presystemically.54 the interpatient
variability is large (68%) and not signiﬁcantly reduced by the
co-administration of food (52%).54
 xxxd2724xxx 
the maximum plasma concentration of  xxxd2724xxx  is reached 3 h
after oral administration.55 the absolute bioavailability is unknown but again cannot be high since the systemic exposure is
increased by 82% when the drug is given with a high-fat meal
compared to fasted state.56 the interpatient variability in exposure
is 32–64% and unexplained yet.57 in the phase i dose escalation
study a saturation of serum levels was observed with doses ranging from 400 to 1200 mg daily. a possible explanation might be
that the uptake of  xxxd2724xxx  is saturated at doses exceeding
400 mg since a modiﬁed dose schedule to a twice-daily regimen
results in an increased exposure.55
absorption: in summary
most tkis reach the maximum plasma concentration relatively
fast (3–6 h) with sunitinib as the only exception (6–12 h) (table 2).
the absolute bioavailability is only known for the three earliest
registered tkis (imatinib, geﬁtinib and  xxxd2029xxx ). it is remarkable
that the bioavailability is not mandatory for registration since this

information is used in the clinical practice to treat patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy/physiology. tkis are generally well
soluble in acidic environment and the solubility rapidly declines
above ph 4–6. a pronounced effect of food was expected for all
tkis since food can rapidly buffer gastric acid and thereby negatively inﬂuence the drug’s solubility. however, food has an effect
on only a few tkis and even then in the opposite direction, indicating that other possible factors such as micelle formation or a
hydrophobic vehicle (fat) are more important for the absorption
of tkis than the drug’s solubility is.
the bioavailability of lapatinib and  xxxd2724xxx  was pronouncedly
increased by food, the bioavailability of  xxxd2029xxx  was marginally
increased, the bioavailability of geﬁtinib, sorafenib and  xxxd1815xxx 
is clinical non-signiﬁcantly increased by food and food has no effect on the bioavailability of imatinib and sunitinib. only sorafenib
and  xxxd2724xxx  showed a less than proportional increase in exposure
with dose escalation which could be result of multiple mechanisms, e.g., saturation at the absorption site, solubility aspects
and transporter interactions. this non-proportionality distinguishes them from the other tkis and might be addressed in future
research. also the large and unexplained interpatient variability of
all tkis warrants further research.

distribution
imatinib
imatinib is extensively distributed into tissues and highly protein bound, predominantly to albumin and a1-glycoprotein
(agp), which is translated into a large volume of distribution of
435 l and a long half life of 18 h.26,58–60 changes in the unbound
drug fraction had a large effect on the intracellular drug concentration in in vitro experiments.61 the role of agp on the pharmacokinetics is underscored in in vivo studies, and a possible relation was
suggested between imatinib-free plasma levels and the treatment
efﬁcacy.62–65 imatinib only penetrates in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(csf) to a limited extent; 100-fold lower levels were measured
in the central nervous system (cns) compared to plasma.61,66–70
this limited penetration in the cns was conﬁrmed in a non-human
primate model. the drug appears to concentrate in the sinuses and
tissues surrounding the brain.58,71 atp binding-cassette (abc)
transporters  xxxg10xxx  and to a lesser extent  xxxg22xxx  are suggested
to strongly regulate the uptake in the cns and malignant cells.
inhibition of  xxxg10xxx  in in vitro and animal studies resulted in a 2–
10-fold increase in cns penetration.66,67,69,70 however, the clinical
relevance of the efﬂux transporters has to be investigated in humans. in in vivo and in vitro studies a 5–8 cell/plasma ratio was observed which indicates that imatinib is actively transported into
the leukemia cells and a possible role for the organic cation transporter (oct) 1 is hypothesized.61,62

geﬁtinib

 xxxd2724xxx 

geﬁtinib is extensively distributed into the tissues and highly
protein bound (to albumin and agp) which results in a large volume of distribution of 1400 l and a long half life of 48 h.72,73 the
blood to plasma ratio of 0.76 suggests that the drug mainly binds
to plasma proteins, with a preference for agp, and to a lesser degree to blood cells.72 the penetration in the cns is poor, probably
as a result of  xxxg10xxx  mediated efﬂux at the blood–brain barrier.73
the drug preferably distributes into highly perfused tissues (lung,
liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract) including tumor tissues.73
in mice bearing human tumor xenografts the tumor cell/plasma ratio was 11-fold as was the skin/plasma ratio which points into the
direction of active transport into speciﬁc tissues.74

the volume of distribution of  xxxd2724xxx  is not reported. although
the high level of protein binding (98%) and the long half life
(17 h) suggest that the volume of distribution is presumably
large.

 xxxd2029xxx 
 xxxd2029xxx  and geﬁtinib have a common chemical backbone
structure and are distributed very similarly in the human body.  xxxd2029xxx  is also extensively protein bound, predominantly to albumin
and agp, has a long half life of 36.2 h and an accompanying large
volume of distribution of 232 l.40 agp concentration and steadystate exposure (auc) are tightly linked.43 agp together with total
bilirubin and smoking status were the most important factors
affecting the drug clearance.75 the penetration of  xxxd2029xxx  in the
cns is poor, with cns levels that represent 7% of the plasma
exposure.76
sorafenib
the volume of distribution of sorafenib is not reported. however, since the drug is highly protein bound (99.5%) and has a
long half life of 25–48 h, a large volume of distribution is
expected.47
sunitinib
sunitinib has a large volume of distribution of 2230 l and is
highly (95%) protein bound. the half life of the drug is 40–60 h.49
 xxxd1815xxx 
 xxxd1815xxx  is extensively distributed in the extravascular space
and is highly protein bound (94%) which results in a large volume
of distribution of 2505 l and a half life of 3–5 h.77 the distribution
between plasma and blood cells was equal in in vitro experiments.77 the brain penetration is poor. in three patients the csf:
plasma ratios ranged from 0.05 to 0.28. however,  xxxd1815xxx  appears to be more potent against cns tumors than imatinib which
might be the result of a much greater potency (325-fold) along
with the low amount of proteins in the cns resulting in a relatively
large fraction of unbound drug.78
lapatinib
the volume of distribution of the terminal phase of lapatinib is
>2200 l and the half life is 24 h. the drug is highly protein bound
(>99%) to albumin and agp.79 rat and mouse studies demonstrated
a very limited penetration of the drug in the cns which was increased with 40-fold in  xxxg10xxx / xxxg22xxx  knockout mice though single transporter knockout mice have only limited effect on the
cns penetration.80,81 the translation of the results of these animal
studies to human remains difﬁcult and therefore additional studies
in humans are warranted.

distribution: in summary
tkis are extensively distributed into tissues and are highly protein bound, resulting in a large volume of distribution and a long
terminal half life (table 2). the volume of distribution, the afﬁnity
for speciﬁc plasma proteins and the cns penetration is not reported for all tkis yet. however since the tkis share multiple
pharmacokinetic characteristics, parallels might be drawn between the tkis. especially, the inﬂuence of agp on the pharmacokinetics and efﬁcacy of tkis might be interesting, since tkis are
preferably bound to this plasma protein and agp is often elevated
in cancer patients and could therefore interfere with an effective
treatment.

metabolism
imatinib
imatinib is primarily metabolized through cytochrome p450
(cyp) 3a4 and  xxxg592xxx  with cyp2d6, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 and
cyp1a2 playing a minor role.28,82–84 a recent study identiﬁed
two extrahepatic enzymes ( xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx ) and the ﬂavincontaining mono-oxygenase 3 (fmo-3) enzyme as being capable
of extensively metabolizing the drug.83 additionally, imatinib can
inhibit cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 metabolism.34,84,85 patients carrying
a polymorphism in cyp2d6 (*4 allele) show a reduced apparent
clearance indicating that cyp2d6 appear to be important in vivo
in the metabolism of imatinib.86 the clinical relevance of these enzymes at steady-state pharmacokinetics, under auto inhibition
metabolic pathways, is mainly unsolved and needs to be addressed
in additional studies. the main metabolite is cgp74588 which represents approximately 10% of the imatinib auc and has similar potency in vitro.25

geﬁtinib
in vitro studies indicate that geﬁtinib is metabolized by cyp3a4,
 xxxg592xxx , cyp2d6 and by the extrahepatic enzyme  xxxg575xxx .39,87 the
drug inhibits cyp2c19 and cyp2d6 although the clinical relevance
is questioned.88 the main metabolite is the o-desmethyl derivate
(m523595) which is present at concentrations similar to geﬁtinib
and is formed through cyp2d6 metabolism.87,89 m523595 and gefitinib have similar potency against epithelial growth factor receptor (egfr)  xxxg2198xxx  activity in isolated enzyme assays.
however, the metabolite has lower activity in a cell based assay
due to the poor penetration into the cell and is therefore unlikely
to contribute signiﬁcantly to the therapeutic activity.74 in cyp2d6
poor metabolizers a higher exposure to geﬁtinib was observed
compared to the extensive metabolizers. additionally, m523595
was undetectable in poor metabolizers. cyp3a4 activity and
 xxxg592xxx  polymorphisms did not explain the large interindividual
variability.89 in vitro studies claim that cyp3a4 is the most prominent enzyme in geﬁtinib metabolism though conﬂicting data are
presented.73,87,88 however in vivo data suggests that besides
cyp3a4 also cyp2d6 activity has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
exposure.89,90

 xxxd2029xxx 

lapatinib

the overall metabolism of  xxxd2029xxx , and formation of o-desmethyl- xxxd2029xxx  (osi-420), is predominantly through cyp3a4 and
 xxxg592xxx  and to a lesser extent by cyp1a2 and the extrahepatic isoform  xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx , with only a minor role for cyp2d6 and
 xxxg586xxx .40,75,87,91 however, induction of the enzymes cyp1a2 and
 xxxg575xxx  has a pronounced effect on the drug exposure, indicating
that both enzymes might have a more prominent role in the
in vivo  xxxd2029xxx  metabolism as suggested by the in vitro results.91
 xxxd2029xxx  is a moderate  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) inducer and
strongly induces cyp3a4 mrna levels, although the formation of
1-hydroxymidazolam is decreased in in vitro experiment showing
the potency of  xxxd2029xxx  to inhibit cyp3a4 metabolism.92 conﬂicting data are published on the effect the drug has on cyp3a4
metabolism.87

in vitro studies indicate that lapatinib is primarily metabolized
to oxidation products by cyp3a4, 3a5, 2c19 and 2c8.79 the major
enzyme is cyp3a4 which accounts for approximately 70% of the
metabolism. one metabolite gw690006 remains active against
egfr however it has lost activity against her-2, whereas other
metabolites appear to be inactive.79 lapatinib is an inhibitor of
cyp3a4 and  xxxg586xxx  and may therefore interact with substrates
of these enzymes; additional studies to investigate this effect are
ongoing.79

sorafenib
oxidative metabolism of sorafenib is mediated by cyp3a4,
additionally the drug is glucuronidated by udp glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) 1a9.47 around 50% is eliminated in the unchanged
form which is either the result of poor metabolism capacity or
the result of a low fraction of the drug that is absorbed from the
intestines.

 xxxd2724xxx 
 xxxd2724xxx  is mainly metabolized through cyp3a4. in vitro data
demonstrate that the drug is a competitive inhibitor of cyp3a4,
 xxxg586xxx , cyp2c9, cyp2d6 and ugt1a1. additional in vitro data
show that  xxxd2724xxx  may induce  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg586xxx  and cyp2c9.57
in vivo data have been published on the clinical relevance of
cyp3a4 inhibition in an interaction study with midazolam and
for ugt1a1 in a genetic polymorphism study describing an increased risk of  xxxd2724xxx  induced hyperbilirubinemia for the
ugt1a1 *28 genotype.56,96

metabolism: in summary
sunitinib
sunitinib is primarily metabolized by cyp3a4 to produce its primary active metabolite su12662 which is further metabolized by
cyp3a4 into inactive metabolites.93 data on additional enzymes
involved in the metabolism are lacking.

 xxxd1815xxx 
 xxxd1815xxx  is extensively metabolized and thus relatively small
amount of unchanged drug is excreted.94  xxxd1815xxx  is primarily
metabolized by cyp3a4 to produce its pharmacologically active
metabolites; m4, m5, m6, m20 and m24 that represent around
5% of the parent compound auc. flavin-containing mono-oxygenase 3 (fmo-3) and ugt are also involved in the formation drug
metabolites.51 in vitro data demonstrate that multiple cyp isoforms (e.g.,  xxxg575xxx , 1b1 and 3a5) are capable of metabolizing
 xxxd1815xxx , however the relevance of these other cyp-enzymes
in vivo requires further investigation.95

all tkis are metabolized in a very similar way (table 3, fig. 1).
all tkis are primarily metabolized by cyp3a4, with other cyp-enzymes and for some tkis (sorafenib and  xxxd1815xxx ) and ugt playing only a minor role. the enzymes that show afﬁnity are mostly
identiﬁed in in vitro experiments, whereas the clinical effects of
the major enzymes is typically investigated in in vivo interaction
studies in healthy volunteers. the clinical relevance of the involvement of minor enzymes is largely unsolved at the time of registration and needs to be addressed in additional studies after
registration. several tkis (imatinib, geﬁtinib, lapatinib and  xxxd2724xxx ) are inhibitors of the enzymes by which they are primarily
metabolized themselves, this could alter their metabolism substantially upon multidose use at steady-state pharmacokinetics.
there is little insight in the steady-state metabolism at this point,
which is surprising since these drugs are used on a daily basis.
some tkis ( xxxd2029xxx , sorafenib, sunitinib and  xxxd1815xxx ) are
thought to have no effect on cyp-enzyme activity which might
be the result of a lack of data rather than an absent effect. additional research to investigate the effect of these drugs on cyp-enzyme activity is needed.

excretion
imatinib
imatinib is mainly eliminated trough the liver. the kidneys only
excrete a minimal amount of the drug and its metabolites. at this

point there is still a discussion ongoing whether the clearance increases, decreases or remains the same at steady-state.97–100 however, a decrease in clearance seems more plausible since imatinib
is capable of inhibiting its own metabolic pathways. of a single
dose imatinib in healthy volunteers 81% of the dose was recovered
in urine (13.2%; 5% as unchanged imatinib) and feces (67.8%; 23%

as unchanged imatinib) in 7 days.25 this suggests that the drug
clearance will more likely be affected by hepatic impairment than
by renal dysfunction.61 surprisingly, two independent groups
found that renal impairment has a pronounced effect on imatinib
pharmacokinetics.62,101 in contrary a case study in an end-stage renal function patient claims no effect on the pharmacokinetics,
however the clearance in this patient was signiﬁcantly reduced
compared to patients with normal renal function.102 two possible
explanations for this apparent discrepancy were put forward: a
correlation between renal failure and agp levels and an effect of
elevated levels of uremic toxins in renal failure on the organic
anion transporting polypeptide  xxxg2165xxx  and hereby inﬂuencing
the hepatic elimination.101,103,104 moreover, there was no effect
observed of mild and moderate liver dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and cgp74588 in three independent studies.105–107 severe liver dysfunction resulted in elevated drug
exposure levels.106 renal and hepatic impairment is no reason for
abstaining patients from imatinib treatment though patients with
moderate renal failure should start at a 50% decreased dose and
patients with severe liver dysfunction are advised to start with a
25% dose reduction.24

ronidated metabolites in the urine.47 approximately 50% of an oral
dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the feces, due to either
inefﬁcient metabolism or lack of absorption.47 mild to moderate
hepatic impairment does not signiﬁcantly alter the exposure.
sorafenib pharmacokinetics has only recently been studied in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment.109 after a single
dose of 400 mg no signiﬁcant alterations were observed in drug
and metabolite auc regardless of the severity of renal or hepatic
impairment. however, only patients with normal or mild hepatic
and renal dysfunction tolerated (without experiencing dose limiting toxicities) a dose of 400 mg twice daily at steady-state. patients
with moderate renal and hepatic dysfunction needed a dose reduction of 50%, while patients with severe hepatic impairment did not
tolerate sorafenib. patients with very severe hepatic and renal dysfunction only tolerated 200 mg once daily, no explanation for the
discrepancy between the tolerance in severe and very severe hepatic impairment is provided.109 this recent study provides valuable
information since sorafenib is used for the treatment of patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma that is often accompanied by severe
hepatic impairment.

geﬁtinib

sunitinib

about 90% of geﬁtinib is recovered in feces (86%) and urine
(0.5%) over 10 days indicating that renal excretion is not a major
route of elimination.35 surprisingly, in patients with moderate
and severe elevated liver tests the pharmacokinetics was not altered. no data are available on the inﬂuence of renal impairment
on the pharmacokinetics.39

sunitinib is primarily eliminated via the feces (61%), with renal
elimination accounting for only 16% of the administered dose.
there are no studies on the pharmacokinetics in patients with serious hepatic or renal insufﬁciency. however, in pharmacokinetic
studies where also the creatinine clearance was assessed, there appeared to be no pharmacokinetic alterations in volunteers with a
wide range of creatinine clearances.110 additionally in a case report
describing two hemodialyzed patients on sunitinib therapy the
plasma concentration of the drug and its major metabolite at steady-state were comparable to patients with normal renal
function.111

 xxxd2029xxx 
following a 100 mg oral dose of  xxxd2029xxx , 91% of the dose was
recovered over 11 days: 83% in feces and 8% in urine of which 1%
and 0.3% as parent drug, respectively.108 no data are available
regarding the inﬂuence of hepatic dysfunction and/or hepatic
metastases and renal dysfunction on the drug pharmacokinetics.40
sorafenib
sorafenib is eliminated primarily through the liver. of a 100 mg
dose 77% is excreted with the feces and 19% is excreted as glucu-

 xxxd1815xxx 
 xxxd1815xxx  is mainly excreted by feces, 85% of which 19% as intact drug. urine excretion is around 4% of which <1% as unchanged
 xxxd1815xxx .51,112 no data are available on the effect of hepatic and
renal impairment on  xxxd1815xxx  pharmacokinetics.51

n.p. van erp et al. / cancer treatment reviews 35 (2009) 692–706

699

lapatinib

imatinib

lapitinib is primarily eliminated hepatically, with 27% of the
oral dose recovered in the feces and <2% recovered in the urine.79
it is suggested that a large part of the oral dose remains in the
intestines and is not absorbed which may contribute to the most
prevalent dose limiting toxicity diarrhea. indeed, diarrhea showed
no relation to serum levels of lapatinib.113 in patients with severe
hepatic impairment the auc of lapatinib was increased by >60%
and the half life was 3-fold increased compared to patients normal hepatic function.79 no data are available on the inﬂuence of severe renal impairment.

the high bioavailability of imatinib, a substrate for multiple
cyp-enzymes (especially cyp3a4 and  xxxg592xxx ), and also for  xxxg10xxx ,
 xxxg22xxx  with ambiguous results for slc transporters, is remarkable
and can only be explained by a low hepatic extraction and low efﬁcient transport of imatinib by the efﬂux transporters.115,117–119
although conﬂicting results have been published, imatinib is most
likely a substrate and an inhibitor of  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx .120 the
 xxxg22xxx  421c/a polymorphism is associated with a reduced clearance in humans.65 a recent study in 90 cml patients showed a pronounced effect of  xxxg10xxx  1236c/t and 2677g/t polymorphisms on
trough drug levels and an corresponding clinical effect (major
molecular response).121 however, additional studies are necessary
to conclusively determine the role of abc-transporters on imatinib
pharmacokinetics and efﬁcacy. there appears to be a modest role
for the organic cation transporter 1 (oct1) as observed in in vitro
experiments. oat1,  xxxg2115xxx  and oct2 do not transport imatinib
in vitro which is consistent with their presence on the kidneys
and the relative low renal clearance.117,122  xxxg2165xxx  and  xxxg2112xxx 
appeared to have afﬁnity for the drug, however the in vivo relevance is not yet studied.163 since the precise role of the transporters on imatinib disposition and the effect of transporter inhibition
by the drug is not completely understood, no additional warnings
have been added to the drug label. however, alertness is necessary
for possible drug interactions on drug transporter level. moreover,
the highly polymorphic transporters might explain at least in part
the large interpatient variability.

 xxxd2724xxx 
 xxxd2724xxx  recovery was assessed over 7 days after a single dose
and showed 4.4% of the drug being recovered in urine and 93.5%
in feces (69% unchanged  xxxd2724xxx ). a large amount (31%) of
unchanged  xxxd2724xxx  excreted via the feces was suggested to be
the result of unabsorbed drug.114  xxxd2724xxx  pharmacokinetics has
not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment,
however the drug label unfoundedly warns for the possible risk
of giving  xxxd2724xxx  to patients with hepatic impairment.57

excretion: in summary
all tkis are predominantly excreted with the feces and only a
minor fraction is eliminated with the urine. the fraction of unchanged drug in the feces can vary widely among the tkis. large
fraction of unchanged drug in the feces can either be the result
of a relative large fraction that is not absorbed and directly
eliminated or by a low efﬁcient metabolism. without data on the
absolute bioavailability or the time frame of the fecal elimination
it is difﬁcult to distinguish between both mechanisms. data on
the effects of mild, moderate or severe renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tkis are mainly absent (table
6). for the few tkis where the effect is studied some unexpected
results are observed. mild to moderate hepatic impairment did
not affect the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and geﬁtinib whereas
severe hepatic impairment did affect the pharmacokinetics of
imatinib and lapatinib and did not affect the pharmacokinetics of
geﬁtinib. surprisingly, mild to moderate renal impairment did
affect the pharmacokinetics of imatinib pharmacokinetics. since
the patients treated with these drugs are at risk to develop renal
or hepatic impairment at any stage of their disease it is necessary
that more data become available on the possible inﬂuence of these
impairments on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs.

drug transporters
the abc drug transporters such as  xxxg10xxx  (p-glycoprotein;
p-gp),  xxxg13xxx  (multidrug resistance-associated protein; mrp1)
and  xxxg22xxx  ( xxxg22xxx ; mxr) are efﬂux
transporters and are now recognized to have an important role
in the absorption, distribution, excretion and toxicity of xenobiotics.115 also the solute carrier family (slc) transporters, which are
inﬂux transporters, are receiving more attention although their
effect on drug kinetics is less well established at this point.116
members of the slc family are the solute carrier organic anion
transporter families ( xxxg2163xxx ), solute carrier peptide transporter family ( xxxg2088xxx ), and organic zwitterion/cation transporters (octns).116
also for the disposition of tkis efﬂux and inﬂux transporters are
gaining interest.

geﬁtinib
geﬁtinib also interacts with  xxxg22xxx  and to a lesser extend with
 xxxg10xxx .123 in in vitro experiments the drug appeared to reverse
 xxxg22xxx  mediated resistance by inhibiting  xxxg22xxx  at relatively high
drug concentrations.123–125 it is a substrate of  xxxg22xxx  in in vitro
experiments at clinically relevant drug concentration. additionally
patients carrying the  xxxg22xxx  421c/a polymorphism have higher
geﬁtinib exposure and more diarrhea compared to those carrying
the wild-type  xxxg22xxx  genotype.125,126 no association was found
between
the
 xxxg10xxx 
3435c/t
genotype
and
geﬁtinib
pharmacokinetics.125
 xxxd2029xxx 
in in vitro experiments  xxxd2029xxx  was shown to be a substrate for
 xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  but not for  xxxg15xxx . in mice studies the absence
of  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  signiﬁcantly affected the oral bioavailability.127  xxxd2029xxx  also inhibits the  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  drug efﬂux
function.128 in a recent study in humans the  xxxg22xxx 15622c/t
and 1143c/t polymorphisms, resulting in a reduced expression of
the transporter, were associated with increased auc and cmax.129
sorafenib
the role of transporters on the disposition of sorafenib is yet
unknown.
sunitinib
recently, an in vitro study demonstrated that sunitinib is a high
afﬁnity inhibitor of  xxxg22xxx  and inhibits  xxxg10xxx , albeit more weakly.
moreover, the drug is also a substrate of both transporters.130 the
bioavailability might therefore be affected by polymorphisms in
the genes encoding for these transporters but this needs to be
addressed in clinical studies.130

700

n.p. van erp et al. / cancer treatment reviews 35 (2009) 692–706

 xxxd1815xxx 
in vitro data demonstrated that  xxxd1815xxx  is a substrate of
 xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  but not a potent inhibitor of these transporters.77,131,132 additional in vitro studies suggested that the drug is
also a substrate for hoct1 however the uptake is much less hoct1
dependent compared to imatinib. inhibitors of hoct1 did not
interfere with the uptake of dasatanib and it is hypothesized that
the uptake in vivo is more likely driven by diffusion than by active
transport.131,132
lapatinib
results from in vitro studies indicated that lapatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of the efﬂux transporters  xxxg10xxx ,  xxxg22xxx 
and solely an inhibitor of  xxxg2164xxx .80 it has the potency to reverse
the  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  driven resistance on multi drug resistant
cells in vitro.133 in addition, lapatinib did not inhibit nor was a substrate of oat, oct and  xxxd3472xxx  transporter (urat) transporters
which is in line with the marginal renal clearance of the drug.80
further studies in humans are warranted to further clarify the role
of transporters on the efﬁcacy, disposition, toxicity and drug
interactions.80
 xxxd2724xxx 
 xxxd2724xxx  appears to be a substrate and an inhibitor of  xxxg10xxx 
and  xxxg22xxx , however the clinical relevance of these in vitro assessments need to be addressed.57,134
drug transporters: in summary
all tkis are substrates and inhibitors of  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx ,
except for  xxxd1815xxx  which appears to be no inhibitor of these
transporters and for sorafenib of which no data are available.
additionally, imatinib and  xxxd1815xxx  might interact with oct1. no
data are available on the afﬁnity of the other tkis for the slc
transporter family (table 3). multiple in vitro studies have been
published on the effect tkis have on drug transporters and visa
versa. at this point the clinical signiﬁcance of polymorphic transporters and interactions between drugs on transporters are mainly
undeﬁned.
drug–drug interactions
imatinib
the drug label of imatinib warns for co-administration of potent
cyp3a4 inhibitors and for co-administration of substrates of
cyp3a4 with a narrow therapeutic window. this warning makes
the clinical practice difﬁcult since a large group of drugs is either
a substrate or an inhibitor of cyp3a4. the inhibitory effect of the
drug on cyp3a4 was investigated by an interaction study with simvastatin. simvastatin clearance was reduced by 70% indicating a
clinically relevant strong cyp3a4 inhibitory effect.85 contrary results are presented in interaction studies with cyp3a4 inhibitors
after a single dose (ketoconazole) and at steady-state (ritonavir).84,135 cyp3a4 inducers (rifampicin, st. john’s wort, phenytoin
and enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (eiaed’s)) very constantly show a decrease in imatinib exposure.15,100,136–139 administration of the drug together with metoprolol, a cyp2d6 substrate,
resulted in an increase in metoprolol exposure of 23% with moderate differences between the intermediate and extensive metabolizers.140 smoking does not alter imatinib exposure, indicating no
major contribution of cyp1a2 in the metabolism of the drug.141

an interaction between imatinib and warfarin is hypothesized since
both increases and decreases in inr have been reported after starting therapy. warfarin is a substrate of cyp2c9 and cyp3a4 and both
enzymes are involved in the metabolism of imatinib.28 interactions
through the other enzymes are hypothesized and warned for in the
drug label but not yet investigated. also the effect of drug transporter inhibitors (e.g., pantoprazol, cyclosporine) on the disposition
of the drug in humans is not evolved yet and neither is the inﬂuence
of imatinib on drugs that are transported by  xxxg10xxx  (e.g.,  xxxd1885xxx )
or  xxxg22xxx  (e.g.,  xxxd2740xxx ). the cellular uptake of  xxxd2724xxx  is
enhanced by the co-administration of imatinib due to  xxxg10xxx  and
possibly  xxxg22xxx  inhibition in in vitro studies.142 the drug label does
not include warnings with regard to risks related to drug transporter interactions though alertness is on its place.
geﬁtinib
inhibitors and inducers of cyp3a4 interfere with geﬁtinib exposure. itraconazole elevated the exposure (auc) with 78%. concomitant administration of rifampicin reduced the auc with 83%.88 in
in vitro experiments geﬁtinib stimulates midazolam metabolism
through cyp3a4. an explanation for this observation is not provided yet.87 high doses of ranitidine, inducing a gastric ph > 5.0,
resulted in a decreased geﬁtinib auc.143 geﬁtinib co-administration resulted in a 35% increase in metoprolol exposure indicating
that the drug is a cyp2d6 inhibitor at therapeutic levels.88 in a case
report the possible interaction between herbal medicines (e.g., ginseng) and geﬁtinib is suggested since interruption of the herbal
medicine treatment turned the patient from a non-responder into
a responder. unfortunately, in this case the geﬁtinib plasma levels
were not measured.144 surprisingly, sorafenib reduced the auc of
geﬁtinib by 38%, where geﬁtinib has no effect on sorafenib exposure.145 there is no explanation for this observation.
 xxxd2029xxx 
inhibitors and inducers of cyp3a4 interfere with  xxxd2029xxx  exposure. co-administration of rifampicin results in a 67% decreased
drug exposure (auc).146 ketoconazole increases the drug exposure
(auc0–1) and cmax with 86% and 102%, respectively.147
co-administration of bas 100, a substance in grapefruit juice,
resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in the auc of  xxxd2029xxx  in mice, most
likely due to an increased uptake by inhibiting cyp3a4 or
 xxxg10xxx .148 smoking results in a decreased  xxxd2029xxx  auc (35.9%)
possibly by inducing  xxxg575xxx  and cyp1a2 metabolism.91 the maximum tolerated dose in smokers was 300 mg compared to 150 mg
in non-smokers. additionally the steady-state trough levels and
incidence of rash and diarrhea in smokers at 300 mg were similar
as the data for non-smokers receiving 150 mg  xxxd2029xxx .149
sorafenib
since sorafenib is metabolized by cyp3a4, an interaction with
cyp3a4 inhibitors was expected. in a drug interaction study with
ketoconazole and sorafenib, ketoconazole did not alter the
exposure. however it did decrease the plasma concentration of
sorafenib-n-oxide which is formed through cyp3a4. this ﬁnding
is consistent with an earlier mass-balance study showing that
15% of the administered dose was eliminated by glucuronidation
where only 5% was eliminated as oxidative metabolites.150 coadministration of sorafenib with geﬁtinib causes a decrease in
geﬁtinib exposure of 38%. the interaction can not be mediated
through cyp3a4 inhibition since sorafenib does not inﬂuence the
exposure of midazolam which is suggested to be solely metabolized through cyp3a4.145 in vitro data demonstrated that sorafenib
is a competitive inhibitor of cyp2c19, cyp2d6 and cyp3a4

701

n.p. van erp et al. / cancer treatment reviews 35 (2009) 692–706

although the inhibitory potency does not appear in clinical studies
where the drug was given concomitantly with midazolam (cyp3a4
substrate), dextromethorphan (cyp2d6 substrate) or omeprazol
(cyp2c19 substrate).45,47 sorafenib is also a competitive inhibitor
of  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg586xxx  though the clinical relevance of this inhibition is not studied yet.151 the hypothetical effect on cyp2c9 was
indirectly measured by the effect on warfarin therapy. the inr in
sorafenib treated patients was similar in placebo treated patients.
the effect of cyp3a4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin) is not studied, however an warning is included in the drug label of sorafenib.47 the
drug does interfere with the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly
administered antineoplastic agents doxorubicin and irinotecan.
the exposure of doxorubicin was increased by 21%. the increase
in sn-38 exposure was 67–120% most likely through competition
or inhibition of ugt1a1 and additionally the irinotecan exposure
increased with 26–41%.47
sunitinib
since sunitinib is primarily metabolized through cyp3a4, the
inﬂuence of ketoconazole and rifampicin was investigated in
healthy volunteers. co-administration of ketoconazole increased
the cumulative exposure of sunitinib and su12662 with 50%. rifampicin co-administration resulted in a 50% decrease in combined
systemic exposure.110 it is suggested that sunitinib has no inﬂuence on other co-administered drugs.
 xxxd1815xxx 
the exposure of  xxxd1815xxx  is increased 5-fold on the co-ingestion of ketoconazole in healthy volunteers. rifampicin decreased

the exposure by 82%. in vitro data demonstrated that the drug does
not induce human cyp-enzymes. it however does appear to be a
time dependent cyp3a4 inhibitor. as a result, the co-ingestion of
 xxxd1815xxx  with simvastatin (a cyp3a4 substrate) resulted in a
20% increased exposure to simvastatin. the solubility of  xxxd1815xxx 
appears to be ph dependent.  xxxd2082xxx  reduced the exposure
by 61%, the co-administration of agents that provide prolonged
gastric acid suppression is therefore not recommended.51
lapatinib
lapatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of cyp3a4 and an
inhibitor of  xxxg586xxx . a single dose of a cyp3a4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increases the exposure by 3.6-fold. in contrast carbamazepine, a cyp3a4 inducer, decreases the exposure by 75%.79 an
extrapolation is made to other cyp3a4 inhibitors and inducers
although no clinical data are available on these interactions. dose
adjustment advices are given in the package insert when combining lapatinib with an inducer or an inhibitor. these advices are not
tested in clinical setting and/or on steady-state lapatinib exposure.
in the combination of lapatinib with  xxxd2147xxx , 5-ﬂuorouracil
and irinotecan the auc of sn-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, was increased by 41%. there are multiple suggested explanations for this interaction. lapatinib showed inhibition of cyp3a4,
 xxxg2164xxx ,  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  in vitro which are enzymes and transporters important in the metabolism and disposition of sn-38.
however, further investigation is needed to determine whether
one or all mechanisms are responsible for this in vivo interaction.152 in the combination of lapatinib with paclitaxel the exposure of lapatinib as well as paclitaxel was increased with 21%
and 23%, respectively.79 the mechanism behind the described

interactions is yet unknown. since in vitro data suggest that lapatinib is an inhibitor of  xxxg10xxx , alertness may be warranted when the
drug is co-administered with  xxxg10xxx  substrates.79 however, no
clinical studies are available to conﬁrm this interaction.

 xxxd2724xxx 
 xxxd2724xxx  is mainly metabolized through cyp3a4. the concomitant administration of ketoconazole with  xxxd2724xxx  produces a 3fold increase in systemic exposure.  xxxd2724xxx  itself appears to be
a weak inhibitor of cyp3a4.56 the co-administration of midazolam
with the drug in healthy volunteers resulted in a 30% increase in
the systemic exposure of midazolam.56

drug–drug: in summary
most clinical interaction studies investigate interactions in
healthy volunteers with a single dose of the tki given together
with a cyp3a4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or a single dose of the tki given after a few days of cyp3a4 inducing therapy (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine) (tables 4 and 5). this study
design might not represent the metabolism at steady-state pharmacokinetics, since most tkis are capable of inhibiting at least
partly the enzymes by which they are metabolized. auto-inhibition
could result in the shunting of the metabolism through less prominent metabolic pathways at steady-state. therefore, interaction
studies performed at steady-state pharmacokinetics are more
informative and representative for the clinical relevance of the
investigated enzymes. fortunately, the fda is becoming stricter

n.p. van erp et al. / cancer treatment reviews 35 (2009) 692–706

and demands additional research at steady-state for the newer
tkis (lapatinib,  xxxd2724xxx ) that have potency to inhibit enzymes
and transporters.
conclusions
tkis are a relatively new and fast growing group of anticancer
drugs developed as oral formulations and administered on a daily
basis. in general, these tkis are substrates of several drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes. some of them are also capable
to inhibit drug transporters and enzymes making their disposition
and metabolism at steady-state pharmacokinetics rather complex
and unpredictable. most of the available pharmacokinetic information is based on information obtained from in vitro experiments,
animal studies, drug–drug interaction studies and mass-balance
studies in healthy volunteers with a single dose of the aimed tki.
however, it is difﬁcult to translate the results of these studies to
the clinical oncology practice where these drugs are administered
on a daily basis with possible auto-inhibiting mechanisms signiﬁcantly altering the pharmacokinetics outcomes as well as the relevance of claimed drug interactions. most information is available
for the tkis that are used for the longest time in clinical practice.
a question that arises is whether the knowledge obtained for one
tki should not be used for the rational design of studies with the
other tkis and whether translations between these drugs are possible when confronted with unexpected low or high drug exposure.
in this review the current knowledge on the pharmacokinetic
aspects; absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (adme),
drug transporters and drug–drug interactions of the individual
tkis are described. similarities and differences between the tkis
are summarized. it appears that several pharmacokinetic aspects
are unfortunately not investigated yet for these drugs. while
awaiting the results the only way to anticipate on clinical features
and drug interaction potential in the clinical practice is by translating the knowledge obtained from the other tkis as described in
this review.
