abstract
the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of ochratoxin a (ota) transport by multispecific human organic anion
transporter 4 ( xxxg2109xxx ) using mouse proximal tubule cells stably transfected with  xxxg2109xxx  (s2  xxxg2109xxx ). immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that  xxxg2109xxx  protein was localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule. s2  xxxg2109xxx  expressed  xxxg2109xxx  protein in the apical side as
well as basolateral side and the cells were cultured on the plastic dish for experiments. s2  xxxg2109xxx  exhibited a time- and concentrationdependent, and a saturable increase in ota uptake, with an apparent km value of 22.9 f 2.44 am. the ota uptakes were inhibited by
several substrates for the oats. probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate and citrinin inhibited ota uptake by  xxxg2109xxx  in a competitive manner
(ki = 44.4 – 336.4 am), with the following order of potency: probenecid> xxxd2969xxx >octanoate>citrinin. the efflux of ota by s2  xxxg2109xxx  was
higher than that by mock. addition of ota resulted in slight decrease in viability of s2  xxxg2109xxx  compared with mock. these results indicate
that  xxxg2109xxx  mediates the high-affinity transport of ota on the apical side of the proximal tubule, whereas the transport characteristics of
ota are distinct from those by basolateral oats. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
ochratoxin a (ota) is a naturally occurring mycotoxin
produced as a secondary metabolite in different species of
aspergillus and penicillum [1]. contamination of foods,
particularly cereals, nuts and coffee beans, with ota has
been noted in eastern and central europe, north africa,
north america and japan [2]. as shown in fig. 1a, ota is
a structural analogue of phenylalanine and contains a
chlorinated dihydroisocoumarin moiety [3]. recently, ota
has received considerable attention because of its deleterious effects on human and animal health. ota accumulates
in several tissues in the body, with the kidney being its main
target where it exerts toxic and carcinogenic effects [4].
three forms of human renal disease appear to be also caused,

at least in part, by enhanced exposure to ota: balkan
endemic nephropathy, chronic interstitial nephritis and karyomegalic interstitial nephritis [5]. however, the pathophysiological role of ota in human renal disease has not yet
been completely determined.
in the kidney, ota mainly impairs proximal tubular
functions and causes glucosuria, enzymuria and a decrease
in para-aminohippuric acid (pah) transport [6– 8]. an in
vivo study revealed that probenecid, a typical inhibitor of
organic anion transporter (oat), inhibited the renal clearance of ota [9]. from these results, it is thought that the
excretion of ota into the urine is mainly by tubular
secretion, presumably via the oat system, and this may
play an important role in ota accumulation and development of nephrotoxicity. on the other hand, the mechanism
for the reabsorption of ota on the apical side of the
proximal tubule has been elucidated in membrane vesicles,
cultured cells and isolated proximal tubules [9 –12]. using
the rat nephron segments, it was shown that ph-independent

[3h]ota (547.6 gbq/mmol) was purchased from moravek biochemicals inc. (brea, ca, usa). [3h]estrone
sulfate (es) (1961 gbq/mmol) and [14c]mannitol (532.4
gbq/mmol) were purchased from perkin elmer life sciences (boston, ma, usa). ota, pah, citrinin, octanoate,
 xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd2871xxx , cimetidine, aspartame and indomethacin were obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,

reabsorption of ota in the proximal straight tubule is
mediated by oat-k1, whereas ph-dependent reabsorption
in the proximal convoluted tubule is mediated by h + dipeptide co-transporter [8,11]. however, the molecular
mechanism for the apical ota transport remains unknown.
the secretion or reabsoption of various anionic substances, drugs and xenobiotics is an important physiological
function of the renal proximal tubule [13]. recently, cdnas
encoding transporters mediating organic anion transport
have been successively cloned, including oat1 [14,15],
 xxxg2114xxx  [16],  xxxg2115xxx  [17,18],  xxxg2109xxx  [19], oat-k1 [20], oatk2 [21], organic anion-transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx )
[22],  xxxg2164xxx  [23], oatp3 [24], multiple resistance-associated
protein 2 ( xxxg15xxx ) [25] and human-type i sodium-dependent
inorganic phosphate transporter (npt1) [26].
we have recently characterized ota transport by human
oat1 ( xxxg2113xxx ) and human  xxxg2115xxx  ( xxxg2115xxx ) using proximal
tubule cells stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (s2
 xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx ) [27]. in the current study, we
undertook to elucidate the role of human  xxxg2109xxx  ( xxxg2109xxx )
in ota transport on the apical side of the proximal tubule
using mouse proximal tubule cells stably transfected with
 xxxg2109xxx .

for the generation of antibody against  xxxg2109xxx , rabbits
were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthesized peptides, gnrqeavtvestsl, corresponding to cysteine and the 14 amino acids of the cooh
terminus of  xxxg2109xxx .
light-microscopic analysis of the  xxxg2109xxx  protein was
performed as previously described [28]. briefly, waxed
sections (2 am) were cut and stained by the labeled
streptavidin – biotin method. after dewaxing, the sections
were incubated with 3% h2o2 for 15 min and then with
blocking serum for 15 min. the sections were then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against  xxxg2109xxx  (1:500
dilution) for 2 h. the sections were rinsed with tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% tween 20 (tbst) and incubated
with the biotinylated secondary antibody against rabbit
immunoglobulin (dako, glostrup, denmark) for 1 h. after
rinsing with tbst, the sections were incubated for 30 min
with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated streptavidin
solution. hrp labeling was detected using a peroxidase
substrate solution with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm; dojindo
laboratories, kumamoto, japan). the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin before examination under a
light microscope. for preabsorption experiment, the  xxxg2109xxx 
peptide (200 ag/ml) was added to the  xxxg2109xxx -specific
antibody solution and incubated overnight at 4 jc. using
this preabsorbed antibody, the immunohistochemistry was
performed as described above.

gene was microdissected and s2 cells were established. the
full-length cdna of  xxxg2109xxx  [19] was subcloned into
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa), a mammalian

expression vector. s2 cells stably expressing  xxxg2109xxx  (s2
 xxxg2109xxx ) were obtained by transfecting s2 cells with
pcdna3.1- xxxg2109xxx  coupled with psv2neo, a neomycin

with pcdna3.1 lacking an insert and psv2neo were designated as s2 pcdna3.1 and used as the control (mock). s2
 xxxg2109xxx  and mock were grown in a humidified incubator at
33 jc and 5% co2, using ritc 80-7 medium that con-

tained 5% fbs, 10 ag/ml transferrin, 0.08 u/ml insulin, 10
ng/ml recombinant egf and 400 ag/ml  xxxd2191xxx  [30]. the
cells were subcultured in a medium containing 0.05%

7.2) and used for 25– 30 passages. clonal cells were isolated
using a cloning cylinder, and screened by determining the
optimal substrate for  xxxg2109xxx , [3h]es [19]. s2  xxxg2109xxx 
exhibited a dose- and time-dependent increase in es uptake
activities. the s2 monolayer was determined to be leaky
based on the results of a study wherein we estimated
paracellular secretion from cells cultured on a permeable
support, using d-[14c]mannitol as an indicator. light-microscopic analysis of the  xxxg2109xxx  protein in s2  xxxg2109xxx  was
performed as previously described [30]. the cells were
cultured on transwell chambers (coster, cambridge, ma,
usa). after the cells were washed three times with 50 mm
nh4cl in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) (containing in
mm: 136 nacl, 2.7 kcl, 8.2 nahpo412h2o and 15
khpo4, ph 7.4), they were fixed with paraformaldehyde
lysine periodate (plp) solution (containing 0.01 m naio4,
0.075 m lysine, 0.0375 m phosphate buffer with 2%
paraformaldehyde; ph 6.2) for 2 h at 4 jc. the fixed cells
were stained with the antibody against  xxxg2109xxx  and hrp as
described above. in addition, vertical sections of s2  xxxg2109xxx 
stained with polyclonal antibody against  xxxg2109xxx , showed
that the subcellular localization of  xxxg2109xxx  protein was
mainly on the cell membrane (fig. 2e), whereas no staining
was observed in mock (fig. 2f). both the basolateral and
apical portions of the membrane showed positive staining.
therefore, the cells were cultured on a solid support for use
in the following experiments.

2.4. uptake experiment
uptake experiments were performed as previously
described [30]. the s2 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue
culture plates at a cell density of 1  105 cells/well. after 2
days of culture, the cells were washed three times with
dulbecco’s modified pbs (d-pbs) solution (containing in
mm: 137 nacl, 3 kcl, 8 nahpo4, 1 kh2po4, 1 cacl2 and
0.5 mgcl2; ph 7.4) containing 5 mm d-glucose, and then
preincubated with the same solution for 10 min in a water
bath at 37 jc. the cells were then incubated in d-pbs
containing 5 mm d-glucose with [3h]ota at 100 nm for
time course experiments, and 1 am for inhibition experiments at 37 jc. the uptake was stopped by the addition of
ice-cold d-pbs, and the cells were washed three times with
the same solution. the cells in each well were lysed with 0.5
ml of 0.1 n sodium hydroxide and 2.5 ml of aquasol-2, and
radioactivity was determined using a h-scintillation counter
(aloka, lsc-3100).
2.5. inhibition study
to evaluate the inhibitory effects of several substrates for
an oat on  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake, s2  xxxg2109xxx  was
incubated for 1 min at 37 jc in d-pbs containing 1 am
[3h]ota in the absence or presence of various inhibitors

2.7. efflux study
efflux study was performed as previously described
[30]. s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock were seeded in 24-well tissue

s2  xxxg2109xxx  was incubated with solution containing various concentrations of
[3h]ota in the absence or presence of various substrates at 37 jc. the ki
values were estimated from a lineweaver – burk plot.

tame, octaonate, cimetidine, citrinin, indomethacin and
 xxxd2969xxx . pah, probenecid,  xxxd2871xxx  and cimetidine
were dissolved in d-pbs. indomethacin was initially dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with d-pbs. aspartame,
octanoate, citrinin and  xxxd2969xxx  were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and then diluted with the incubation medium.
the final concentrations of ethanol and dimethylsulfoxide
were adjusted to less than 0.1%, which did not affect the
 xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake in our system.
2.6. kinetic analysis
after preincubation as described above, s2  xxxg2109xxx  was
incubated for 1 min at 37 jc in d-pbs containing different
concentrations of [3h]ota in the absence or presence of
various inhibitors. the concentrations of the inhibitors used
are listed in the table 1. on the basis of [3h]ota uptake
under each condition, double reciprocal plot analyses were
performed as previously described [31]. when the inhibition

three times with the medium and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.1
n sodium hydroxide. the radioactivities within the supernatant and cell lysates were measured by counting the
radioactivity. the rate of efflux at each time point was
presented using the following formula: (effluxed [3h]ota
by s2  xxxg2109xxx   effluxed [3h]ota by mock)/([3h] ota by
s2  xxxg2109xxx  at time 0  [3h]ota accumulated by mock at
time 0).
2.8. cell viability assay
cell viability was assessed using the mtt assay
[30,32,34]. as described above, after s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock
were seeded at a cell density of 2  105 cells/well in 24well plates and cultured for 2 days, cells were cultured in a
medium containing 5% fbs with or without ota for 2
days at 33 jc. the number of s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock 2 days
after inoculation was 6  105 and 4  105 cells/well,
respectively. after incubation, 50 al of 5 mg/ml of mtt
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to the medium (0.5 ml), and the cells
were further incubated for 4 h. after solubilizing the cells
with isopropanol/hcl solution, optical intensity was measured at 570 nm with 630 nm as the reference (beckman,
du640).
2.9. statistical analysis
data are expressed as means + s.e. statistical differences
were determined using student’s unpaired t-test. differences
were considered significant at p < 0.05.

subtracted from those by s2  xxxg2109xxx . each value represents mean f s.e. of
four determinations from one typical experiment.

culture plates at a cell density of 1  105 cells/well. after
the cells were cultured for 2 days, they were washed three
times with d-pbs and then preincubated in the same
solution for 10 min in a water bath at 37 jc. thereafter,
the monolayers were incubated with 300 nm [3h]ota for
30 min at 37 jc, washed immediately once with 1500 al
d-pbs, and incubated at 37 jc with 500 al of d-pbs.
since the time course of ota efflux was prompt and three
times washing of cells takes time, the significant amount of
ota was effluxed during washing of cells with 500 al dpbs. thus, in order to minimize the ota efflux during
washing, the cells were washed once with 1500 al d-pbs.
after the incubation for the indicated periods of time, 50 al
of the supernatant was collected. then, the medium was
aspirated immediately and the cell monolayers were washed

3. results
3.1. immunohistochemical analysis of  xxxg2109xxx  protein in
human kidney
light-microscopic analysis of 2-am waxed sections
demonstrated that there was specific immunostaining for
 xxxg2109xxx  in the proximal tubules (fig. 2a – c). as shown in
fig. 2a and b, in the cortex, there was staining for  xxxg2109xxx 
in the proximal convoluted tubules. in addition, in the outer
medulla,  xxxg2109xxx  was located in the proximal straight

71

tubules (fig. 2c). in contrast, no immunostaining for
 xxxg2109xxx  was observed in glomeruli, the other nephron segments and arterioles. by preincubation of the antibody with
 xxxg2109xxx  peptide, the immunostaining was completely diminished (fig. 2d). the specificity of the antibody for  xxxg2109xxx 
was verified by these results.

1a). in addition, as shown in fig. 1c,  xxxd2969xxx  also
exhibited structural analogy to ota. we have already
determined the inhibitory effects of these substances on
rat-oat1-,  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota uptake
[27,34], and other researchers have also found the inhibitory
effects of some of the substances on ota transport in
tubules or cells [33,35 – 39]. as shown in fig. 6, probenecid,
 xxxd2871xxx , aspartame, octanoate, citrinin, indomethacin
and  xxxd2969xxx  significantly inhibited  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota
uptake (n = 4, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs.
control), whereas pah and cimetidine did not (n = 4, n.s.).
3.4. kinetic analysis of inhibitory effects of various drugs on
ota uptake by  xxxg2109xxx 
fig. 8. efflux of ota by  xxxg2109xxx . after 30 min of incubation in a solution
containing 300 nm [3h]ota at 37 jc, s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock were incubated
in solution at 37 jc for 30 min. the amount of [3h]ota within the
supernatant and the cell lysate was determined. the rate of efflux at each
time point was presented as the following formula: (effluxed [3h]ota by
the s2  xxxg2109xxx   effluxed[3h]ota by mock)/([3h]ota accumulated by s2
 xxxg2109xxx  at time 0  [3h]ota accumulated by mock at time 0). each value
represents the mean + s.e. of three determinations.

by s2  xxxg2109xxx  was significantly higher than that by mock.
in order to confirm the specificity of ota uptake mediated by  xxxg2109xxx , s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock were incubated in a
solution containing 100 nm [3h] ota and 100 nm [14c]
mannitol for 5 min. as shown in fig. 4, both ota (a)
and mannitol (b) uptake values by s2  xxxg2109xxx  were higher
than that by mock (n = 4, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.001 vs.
mock). however, ota uptake by  xxxg2109xxx  was approximately fourfold of that by mock, whereas mannitol uptake
by  xxxg2109xxx  was approximately twofold of that by mock.
thus, it was suggested that  xxxg2109xxx  mediates the specific
uptake of ota. the concentration dependence of hoat4mediated ota uptake was examined. the specific uptake
of ota in s2  xxxg2109xxx  revealed saturable kinetics (fig.
5a), and the eadie – hofstee plot gave a single straight
line (fig. 5b). the estimated km value for hoat4mediated ota uptake was 22.9 f 2.44 am (n = 4). the
results suggest that  xxxg2109xxx  is responsible for the highaffinity transport of ota.

to further elucidate the inhibitory effects of hoat4mediated ota uptake, inhibitory kinetics of probenecid,
 xxxd2969xxx , octanoate and citrinin was analyzed. typical
results are shown in fig. 7. the lineweaver –burk plot
analysis of probenecid (a),  xxxd2969xxx  (b), octanoate (c)
and citrinin (d) inhibition on  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake
demonstrated that these compounds inhibited ota uptake
by  xxxg2109xxx  in a competitive manner. the ki value for each
inhibitor tested is shown in the table 1.
3.5. efflux of ota by  xxxg2109xxx 
in order to determine whether  xxxg2109xxx  mediates the efflux
of ota, we compared the efflux of ota by s2  xxxg2109xxx  with
that by mock. as shown in fig. 8, s2  xxxg2109xxx  exhibited
significant amount of ota efflux, in which the amount of
ota efflux by mock was subtracted.

3.3. inhibitory effects on ota uptake by  xxxg2109xxx 
we examined the effects of various substrates on ota
uptake by  xxxg2109xxx . the substances used were as follows:
pah, probenecid (an organic anion transport inhibitor),
 xxxd2871xxx , aspartame (an artificial sweeter), octaonate (a
fatty acid), citrinin (mycotoxin), cimetidine (a  xxxg1079xxx 
antagonist as well as an organic cation transport inhibitor),
indomethacin and  xxxd2969xxx  (an anti-inflammatory drugs).
these substances except cimetidine are organic anions.
aspartame is the n-aspartl- xxxd2916xxx , thus
a structural analogue of phenylalanine and ota [33] (fig.

s2  xxxg2109xxx  and mock were cultured for 48 h in the absence
or presence of various concentrations of ota. as shown in
fig. 9, ota slightly inhibited viability in s2  xxxg2109xxx 
compared with mock, and no significant difference was
observed (n = 4, n.s. vs. mock).

4. discussion
 xxxg2109xxx  was isolated from human placenta and also
shown to be localized to the kidney [19].  xxxg2109xxx  mediated
the uptake of various substrates including pah, es and
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; however, its substrate specificity was relatively narrow compared with that of  xxxg2113xxx 
and  xxxg2115xxx . in the current study,  xxxg2109xxx  was shown to be
localized to the apical membrane of the proximal tubule
within the kidney. based on this, we characterized ota
transport using s2  xxxg2109xxx . in s2  xxxg2109xxx ,  xxxg2109xxx  is sorted to
the apical side as well as the basolateral side (fig. 2e). thus,
in confluent monolayers of s2  xxxg2109xxx  on the plastic dish,
not only the apical side but also the lateral side of  xxxg2109xxx 
protein could be exposed to uptake solution containing
various substrates because tight junction is leaky. in this
regard, we have also isolated madin – darby canine kidney
(mdck) cells stably expressing  xxxg2109xxx  (mdck  xxxg2109xxx ),
where the unidirectional transport of ota from the basolateral side to the apical side of the cells on the permeable
support was recognized and tight junction was well developed (data not shown). the km value for  xxxg2109xxx -mediated
ota uptake in mdck  xxxg2109xxx  cultured on the plastic dish
was similar to that in s2  xxxg2109xxx , i.e., 56.2 f 4.12 am
(unpublished observation).
in the current study,  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake was
found to increase in a dose- and time-dependent manner and
was saturable. the crucial parameter for the estimation of
the transport rate of a substrate is the concentration of its
free, unbound form. in this regard, although more than 99%
of ota is bound to plasma proteins [43,44], only little
albumin is filtered by the glomerulus while free ota is
filtered. thus, free ota concentration in the primary urine
is not necessarily negligible in the uptake of ota into the
proximal tubule. in addition,  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake
was inhibited by various substrates for oats. furthermore,
 xxxg2109xxx  mediated the efflux of ota. thus, it was suggested
that  xxxg2109xxx  mediates the reabsorption and the efflux of
ota on the apical side of the proximal tubule.
the intracellular content of ota in s2  xxxg2109xxx  preincubated in a solution containing 300 nm [3h]ota for 30 min
was 2.11 pmol/mg protein. the intracellular volume of
cultured fibroblasts was reported to be 3.0 al/106 cells using
[14c]urea [45]. assuming that the intracellular volume of s2
 xxxg2109xxx  is similar to that of fibroblasts, the intracellular
concentration of ota in s2  xxxg2109xxx  preincubated for 30 min

73

is estimated as 1.17 am. according to the results of dosedependent experiments (fig. 5a), ota uptake by s2  xxxg2109xxx 
incubated in a solution containing 1.17 am [3h]ota for 2
min was 5.57 pmol/mg protein. on the other hand, during
the 2-min efflux after 30-min incubation, ota efflux by s2
 xxxg2109xxx  was 0.99 pmol/mg protein. based on these, ota
efflux activity by s2  xxxg2109xxx  appears to be much lower than
ota uptake activity.
to our knowledge, there are some reports concerning the
involvement of apical oats in the transport of ota.  xxxg2163xxx 
was shown to mediate the reabsorption of ota (km = 18.9
am) [46]. in addition, as described above, oat-k1 was
thought to mediate the ph-independent reabsorption of ota
in the proximal straight tubule [8]. furthermore,  xxxg15xxx 
mediated the efflux of ota [25]. the relative contribution
of these oats including  xxxg2163xxx , oat-k1,  xxxg15xxx  and
 xxxg2109xxx  to the reabsorption and the efflux of ota on the
apical side of the proximal tubule should be elucidated in
future studies. in addition to these apical oats, the role of
oat-k2 [21],  xxxg2163xxx  [22] and npt1 [26] in the transport of
ota should be further clarified.
the  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake was significantly
inhibited by the presence of probenecid,  xxxd2871xxx ,
aspartame, octaonate, citrinin, indomethacin and  xxxd2969xxx .
these results are consistent with those of previous reports
that various substrates for oats including pah, probenecid,
 xxxd2969xxx  and octanoate inhibited peritubular ota uptake
or ota secretion in rabbit isolated proximal tubules [35 –
39]. in addition, the results of the inhibition experiments
were in contrast to the previous results that these inhibitors,
except aspartame, exhibited significant inhibitory effects on
ota uptake by basolateral oats,  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  [27].
the rank order of ki values of various inhibitors of hoat4mediated ota uptake was the same as that for  xxxg2115xxx - but
not  xxxg2113xxx -mediated ota uptake [27]. the ki values of
probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate and citrinin for hoat4mediated ota uptake were much higher than those for
 xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota uptake except that of
citrinin for  xxxg2113xxx -mediated ota uptake (more than threefold) [27,47]. thus, it was suggested that there exist some
differences in the affinity and the effects of various substrates on ota uptake between apical oat ( xxxg2109xxx ) and
basolateral oats ( xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx ). as far as we know,
there is only one report describing the effects of these
substrates on the apical ota transport, i.e., aspartame
exhibited no significant inhibitory effects on apical ota
uptake in mdck cells [37]. the discrepancy between the
result of this study and our result may be due to the ota
uptake in mdck cells mediated not only by oat but also
by proton-dependent peptide transporter.
in humans, the steady-state maximum plasma concentration of probenecid was reported to be 170 am [40] and its
unbound fraction was 11.0% [41]. thus, the steady-state
maximum concentration of unbound probenecid in the
plasma was estimated to be 18.7 am. since the therapeutically relevant concentration of a drug in the plasma are

74

thought to be within fivefold of the steady-state maximum
concentration of a drug in the plasma [48], the therapeutically relevant concentration of unbound probenecid in the
plasma is though to be within 93.5 am. in addition, since an
unbound drug is filtered through glomerulus, the concentration of unbound probenecid within the tubular fluid in the
proximal tubule may be within 93.5 am. thus, the ki value
of probenecid for  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake (4.40 am)
was much lower than the concentration of unbound probenecid within the tubular fluid in the proximal tubule (more
than threefold) [47]. based on these, it was predicted that
probenecid within the tubular fluid could inhibit ota
uptake in the apical side of the proximal tubule.
 xxxd2969xxx  exhibits inhibitory effects on  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota reabsorption on the apical side of the proximal
tubule. however,  xxxd2969xxx  appears to have no clinical
significance. the steady-state plasma concentration of  xxxd2969xxx  was reported to be 24.0 am and its unbound fraction
was 0.02% [42]. the steady-state maximum concentration
of unbound  xxxd2969xxx  in the plasma is estimated to be
approximately 0.0048 am. this concentration of  xxxd2969xxx 
is much lower than the ki value for  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota
uptake, 4.88 am.
since the addition of ota to s2  xxxg2109xxx  culture resulted
in no significant effects on viability compared with mock, it
was suggested that  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake may not
significantly contribute to ota-induced nephrotoxicity in
vivo. the results were in contrast to those in which addition
of ota resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of
s2 cells stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (unpublished
observation). previous studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2969xxx  was shown to inhibit ota-induced nephrotoxicity
[49]. in addition,  xxxd2969xxx  inhibited ota uptake mediated
by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  [27], and  xxxg2109xxx . however,  xxxg2109xxx 
did not mediate ota-induced nephrotoxicity. these results
suggest that  xxxd2969xxx  prevented ota-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx . on the other hand,
aspartame was also shown to inhibit ota-induced nephrotoxicity [33,50]. in addition, aspartame inhibited ota
uptake mediated by  xxxg2109xxx , but not  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx 
[27]. since  xxxg2109xxx  did not mediate ota-induced nephrotoxicity, it was suggested that aspartame inhibited ota
uptake by inhibiting some transporters other than  xxxg2113xxx ,
 xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx . however, there is another possibility
for the involvement of  xxxg2109xxx  in the ota-induced nephrotoxicity. since the km value of  xxxg2109xxx  (22. 9 am) is much
higher than those of  xxxg2113xxx  (0.42 am) and  xxxg2115xxx  (0.75
am) (more than threefold) [27,47], ota taken up via
basolateral oats does not move readily across the apical
membrane. this may lead to the buildup of a high concentration of ota, resulting in the selective damage of the
proximal tubular cells.
citrinin is also a nephrotoxic mycotoxin, whose structure
is related to ota. citrinin has been shown to cause renal
dysfunction, such as glucosuria and proteinuria [51]. since
citrinin inhibited  xxxg2109xxx -mediated ota uptake in a com-

petitive manner, it is possible that citrinin is taken up by
 xxxg2109xxx  and accumulated ota induces ota-induced nephrotoxicity.
in conclusion, these results suggest that  xxxg2109xxx  mediates
not only reabsorption but also the efflux of ota in the
apical side of the proximal tubule. in addition, since  xxxg2109xxx 
was originally isolated from human placenta [19], it is
possible that  xxxg2109xxx  in the human placenta plays some role
in the elimination of toxic substances including ota from
the fetus.
