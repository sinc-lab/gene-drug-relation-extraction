abstract
synovitis in horses is frequently treated by administration of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids), which inhibit
cyclooxygenase isoforms (cox-1 and cox-2). constitutively expressed cox-1 is involved in physiologic functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, whereas cox-2 is up-regulated at sites of inﬂammation. thus, cox-2 inhibitors reduce inﬂammation with reduced gastrointestinal side eﬀects as compared to non-selective cox inhibitors. the objective of the present study
was to compare the anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of the preferential cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd2065xxx  with the non-selective cox inhibitor
phenylbutazone in horses with lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced synovitis. three groups of horses (n = 6) received no treatment,
phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg, iv, q12h), or  xxxd2065xxx  (23 mg/kg, iv, q12h), respectively, 2-h following injection of lps into one middle
carpal joint. synovial ﬂuid was analyzed for white blood cell (wbc) count, and txb2 and pge2 levels. phenylbutazone and  xxxd2065xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced wbc count 6 and 24-h following injection of lps compared to untreated horses. in addition, both drugs
signiﬁcantly reduced pge2 levels (p < 0.05) 6-h following lps injection, whereas the probable cox-1 prostanoid txb2 was significantly reduced by phenylbutazone (p < 0.05), but not  xxxd2065xxx .  xxxd2065xxx  may serve as a more selective anti-inﬂammatory agent
than phenylbutazone for treatment of equine synovitis.

studies support the eﬃcacy of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) for use as analgesics in
horses with orthopedic injuries. for example, phenylbutazone was more eﬀective than placebo at reducing
post-operative pain following arthroscopic surgery
(raekallio et al., 1997). of clinically available nsaids,
phenylbutazone has shown good eﬃcacy for treatment
of equine synovitis. for instance, in a model of synovitis
induced by injection of carrageenan into the middle carpal joint, a single treatment with phenylbutazone (4.4
mg/kg, iv) had longer lasting anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects

than  xxxd2423xxx  (2.2–3.63 mg/kg, iv), and phenylbutazone was more eﬀective at reducing synovial pge2 levels
(owens et al., 1996). the principal mechanism of action
of nsaids is inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox), the
rate-limiting enzyme in production of prostanoids from
 xxxd208xxx  (vane, 1971). recently, it has been
determined that there are several distinct cox isoforms
(chandrasekharan et al., 2002). cox-1, a constitutively
expressed enzyme in most tissues, is generally thought to
elaborate prostanoids involved in physiologic functions
such as maintenance of gastrointestinal barrier function
(wallace, 1997), whereas cox-2 expression is upregulated by a variety of inﬂammatory stimuli, including
lipopolysaccharide (lps) (lee et al., 1992). thus,
cox-2 inhibitors have been shown to provide the same

degree of analgesia as non-selective nsaids in human
arthritis trials, while reducing gastrointestinal side effects (silverstein et al., 2000; simon et al., 1999). similarly, the preferential cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd2065xxx  has
been shown to reduce orthopedic pain in dogs with reduced prevalence of gastric ulceration (budsberg et al.,
1999; millis et al., 2002). this clinical outcome could
prove useful in horses, in which gastrointestinal side effects of nsaid administration have been clearly documented in horses receiving normal clinical dosages (lees
et al., 1983; cohen et al., 1995).
the objective of the present study was to compare the
anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of phenylbutazone with  xxxd2065xxx  in horses with lps-induced synovitis. the lps
model was chosen because it is an established model
of transient synovitis in horses, and because lps is a
potent stimulus of cox-2 in equine tissues (hammond
et al., 1999; rodgerson et al., 2001).
all studies were approved by the north carolina
state university institutional animal care and use
committee. eighteen mature horses selected on the basis
of a lack of palpable abnormalities of the carpi, and a
lack of a positive response to carpal ﬂexion were divided
into three groups (n = 6). in a random design, either the
left or right middle carpal joint of each horse was injected with 0.5 ng e. coli 055:b5 lps (palmer and bertone, 1994) prepared in lactated ringerõs solution
(lrs) and the opposite joint was injected with an equal
volume (1 ml) of lrs using aseptic technique. horses
were either untreated with an nsaid (n = 6), or treated with phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg, iv, q12h, n = 6),
or  xxxd2065xxx  (23 mg/kg, iv, q12h, n = 6). the dose of
 xxxd2065xxx  was established during a separate pharmacokinetic trial on six horses (campbell, blikslager, et al.,
unpublished observations). treatments were initiated
2-h after lps injection. horses were closely monitored
following lps injection for local signs of carpal inﬂammation and systemic signs of endotoxemia. for horses
that showed clinical evidence of endotoxemia or excessive discomfort (>grade 2 lameness, using the american
association of equine practitioners scale; parente et al.,
2002), appropriate medications were to be administered
(ﬂunixin, 1.1 mkg, iv, q12h for endotoxemia, or phenylbutazone 4.4 mg/kg, iv, q12h for excessive lameness), and the horse would be excluded from the
study. serial arthrocenteses and collection of synovial
ﬂuid from the middle carpal joints of the horses was performed using aseptic technique at times 0-, 6-, and 24-h
post-lps injection and submitted for cytological analyses. horses were sedated at each time point for arthrocentesis (xylazine, 0.3 mg/kg, iv). the samples from
the 0- and 6-h time points were also analyzed for
pge2 and txb2 using commercially available elisa
kits (biomedical technologies inc., stoughton, ms,
usa). complete blood cell counts were performed 0-,
6-, and 24-h post-lps injection. two-way anova on

repeated measures assessing the eﬀects of time, treatment and time–treatment interaction on synovial ﬂuid
parameters was performed. where there was a signiﬁcant time–treatment interaction, one-way anova was
performed at each time point to discern diﬀerences between treatments. p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
no horses had any observable systemic eﬀects related
to carpal lps injection, including a lack of signiﬁcant
eﬀect on rectal temperature and heart rate. furthermore, there were no signiﬁcant changes in complete
blood counts in any of the horses (p > 0.05). clinical
assessment of joint eﬀusion and inﬂammation, including
joint circumference and subjective assessment of joint
temperature, were unaﬀected by injection with lps in
all treatment groups. however, lameness of grade 2 or
less was noted in 4 of 6 horses receiving no treatment,
2 of 6 phenylbutazone-treated horses, and 3 of 6  xxxd2065xxx -treated horses. in all cases, lameness resolved within
24-h.
evaluation of synovial ﬂuid wbc counts using 2-way
anova on repeated measures revealed signiﬁcant effects of time and treatment, and a signiﬁcant time–treatment interaction (p < 0.05). using one-way anova at
each time point, there was a signiﬁcant increase in wbc
count in lps-injected joints in all groups of horses compared to vehicle-injected joints at 6-h (p < 0.05). however, there was a signiﬁcantly reduced wbc count in
the lps-injected joints from horses that received either
phenylbutazone or  xxxd2065xxx  compared to untreated
horses (fig. 1). although the wbc counts were mark-

edly reduced by 24-h, there were continued signiﬁcant
elevations in leukocyte counts in lps-injected joints
from untreated horses and phenylbutazone horses compared to vehicle-injected joints, whereas there was no

treated with phenylbutazone compared to vehicle-treated joints and compared to joints from the other treatment groups (p < 0.05, fig. 2(b)).
the most important ﬁnding from this study is that a
drug that potentially preferentially inhibits cox-2 can
provide the same degree of anti-inﬂammatory activity
as a non-selective cox inhibitor in equine synovitis.
in other words,  xxxd2065xxx  and phenylbutazone both
inhibited increases in wbc counts in synovial ﬂuid, despite the fact that  xxxd2065xxx  had no inhibitory action on
one of the prostanoids measured (txb2). the latter
may indicate a preferential inhibitory action of  xxxd2065xxx 
on cox-2 within this model, although a lack of eﬀect on
txb2 is not deﬁnitive proof of cox-2 selectivity. this is
because both cox-1 and cox-2 produce the same
intermediate prostanoids (pgg2 and pgh2), whereas
production of pge2 and txb2 is performed by prostanoid synthases acting on pgh2 (moncada and higgs,
1988). however, in some tissues, these synthases are
co-localized with one of the cox isoforms. the best
example of this is the co-localization of thromboxane
synthase with cox-1 in platelets, so that platelet produced txa2 can be conclusively used as an indicator
of cox-1 activity (ouellet et al., 2001). similarly,
pge2 production in lps-stimulated macrophages has
been conclusively linked to cox-2 activity (lee et al.,
1992). these ﬁndings have been extrapolated to whole
blood assays, which make the assumption that txa2
in whole blood is largely produced by cox-1 and
pge2 in whole blood following treatment with lps is
largely produced by cox-2 (glaser et al., 1995; brideau
et al., 1996). a lack of eﬀect of  xxxd2065xxx  on txb2 combined with signiﬁcant inhibition of pge2 in inﬂamed
joints may be attributable to a selective action on
cox-2. however, phenylbutazone only inhibited production of txb2 in joints treated with lps, suggesting
the eﬀect of these drugs on prostanoid levels may relate
to drug properties other than cox selectivity. for
example, it is possible that phenylbutazone reached
higher levels in joints in which lps-induced inﬂammation was present, thereby having a greater inhibitory effect on prostanoid production. the other complicating
factor in interpreting the data is our lack of knowledge
of the pharmacodynamics of  xxxd2065xxx  in equine synovitis. thus, although the dosage of  xxxd2065xxx  was based on
initial pharmacokinetic analyses, we do not know how
this dosage relates to in vitro cox selectivity assays,
and we did not assess synovial ﬂuid  xxxd2065xxx  levels,
which would have been useful when interpreting the action of this drug.
the principal advantage of a cox-2 inhibitor in
horses would be provision of anti-inﬂammatory and
analgesic properties without undesirable side eﬀects such
as gastrointestinal mucosal injury. we have previously
shown that exposure of equine colonic tissue to ﬂunixin
meglumine causes a marked decline in the barrier

function of this tissue, whereas this eﬀect was signiﬁcantly reduced in tissues exposed to  xxxd2065xxx  (campbell
et al., 2002). the present study suggests that  xxxd2065xxx 
has similar anti-inﬂammatory properties as phenylbutazone at the dosages studied, which combined with increased safety at the level of the gastrointestinal tract,
could be advantageous. however, additional studies
on the relationship between dosage, cox selectivity,
and eﬀects on distinct tissues and organ systems are
needed before making clinical recommendations on the
use of  xxxd2065xxx .
