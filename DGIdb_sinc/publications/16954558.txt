dependence of cardiac 11c-meta-hydroxyephedrine retention on  xxxg2148xxx  density.  the norepinephrine analog (11)c-meta-hydroxyephedrine (hed) is used with pet to map the regional distribution of cardiac sympathetic neurons. hed is rapidly transported into sympathetic neurons by the  xxxg2148xxx  (net) and stored in vesicles. although much is known about the neuronal mechanisms of hed uptake and retention, there is little information about the functional relationship between hed retention and cardiac sympathetic nerve density. the goal of this study was to characterize the dependence of hed retention on nerve density in rats with graded levels of cardiac denervation induced chemically with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda).
