abstract we have investigated the binding of  xxxd318xxx  to
calcium-saturated  xxxg2307xxx  in a  xxxg2307xxx /
troponin i complex. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
and [15 n,2 h] xxxg2307xxx  permitted the mapping of
 xxxd318xxx -induced amide proton chemical shifts. a single  xxxd318xxx -binding site in the regulatory domain was found with an
affinity constant of v140 wm31 . in the presence of cardiac
troponin i,  xxxd318xxx  binding to the c domain of cardiac troponin
c was not detected. the pattern of  xxxd318xxx -induced chemical
shifts is consistent with stabilization of more open regulatory
domain conformational states. a similar pattern of chemical shift
perturbations was observed for interaction of the troponin i
cardiac-specific amino-terminus with the  xxxg2307xxx 
regulatory domain. these results suggest that both  xxxd318xxx  and
the cardiac-specific amino-terminus may mediate an increase in
calcium affinity by interacting with and stabilizing open
regulatory domain conformations. chemical shift mapping
suggests a possible role for inactive calcium-binding site i in
the modulation of calcium affinity. ß 2001 federation of european biochemical societies. published by elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
cardiac muscle contraction is regulated by calcium-dependent interactions between members of the troponin (tn) complex and other thin ¢lament proteins including actin and tropomyosin. this complex consists of tnc, i, and t. tnc is the
ca2 -binding subunit of the troponin complex and a potential
drug target in the therapy of congestive heart failure. tnt
makes primary contact with tropomyosin while troponin i
participates in the major protein^protein interaction with recombinant ctnc (desmet1-ala2, cys35ser) (ctnc).
cardiac tnc and tni interact in head to tail fashion such
that the c domain of ctnc interacts with the n domain of
 xxxg2309xxx  [1]. the c domain of ctnc contains two high a¤nity
ca2 /mg2 -binding sites whereas the n domain, or regulatory
domain, contains a single active low a¤nity ca2 -speci¢c

binding site, site ii. site i in the cardiac isoform is naturally
inactive [2]. this region has been suggested to modulate conformational states within the regulatory domain. structures
for the n domain of ctnc bound to  xxxg2309xxx (147^163) [3] and
the c domain of ctnc bound to  xxxg2309xxx (33^80) [4] have been
determined. structural information has not been obtained on
the £exible linker connecting globular domains. cardiac tni
contains a 32 amino acid n-terminal extension that can be
phosphorylated at ser residues 23 and 24 by camp-dependent
 xxxg1836xxx  [5]. in the absence of phosphorylation, this
region is proposed to interact with the ctnc regulatory domain [6].
many ef-hand proteins undergo a conformational change
upon ca2 binding leading to exposure of a hydrophobic
pocket or cleft, referred to as the open/active form, which
interacts with appropriate target proteins. the increased a¤nity of ca2 for the open form is thought to provide the driving force for exposure of the hydrophobic cleft. in the cardiac
system, activation of ctnc appears to require interactions
with both ca2 and the  xxxg2309xxx  regulatory region [3,7,8]. exchange between open and closed n domain conformational
substates has been observed in the presence of ca2 and  xxxg2309xxx 
[6,9,10]. phosphorylation of the cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus, as a consequence of l-adrenergic stimulation, disrupts
this regulatory domain interaction resulting in decreased
ca2 a¤nity and decreased ca2 sensitivity of contraction
[6,11,12].
 xxxd318xxx  is one member of a class of pharmacological compounds capable of binding ctnc and modulating regulatory
domain ca2 a¤nity [13,14]. early studies found an apparent
 xxxd318xxx  ka of 10 wm31 for binding to ca2 -saturated ctnc
[14]. in the presence of  xxxd318xxx , ca2 a¤nity at site ii, the
regulatory site, increased [15,16]. this increase was observed
in both slow and fast skeletal muscle ¢bers, with the e¡ect
being greater in slow ¢bers [17]. nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) studies, using met residues as structural markers,
identi¢ed three or four  xxxd318xxx -binding sites in ctnc [18].
recently, an x-ray crystal structure of ca2 -saturated ctnc
with three bound  xxxd318xxx  molecules has been obtained [19].
the overall ctnc structure was compact with the two globular domains close together [19]. two  xxxd318xxx  molecules are
located in the hydrophobic cavity between domains and make
contact with both domains. a single  xxxd318xxx  appears to stabilize an open regulatory domain conformation by inserting
between helical pairs a-d and b-c, sterically preventing domain closing [19].
these studies prompted us to explore  xxxd318xxx  binding to
the ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complex. amide proton chemical shift pertur-

bation mapping was used to monitor e¡ects of  xxxd318xxx  on
ctnc in [15 n,2 h]ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx (1^211).  xxxd318xxx  binding induces
1
h^15 n amide chemical shift changes within the ctnc regulatory domain consistent with a shift in conformational equilibria toward more open states. stabilization of a more open
conformation is the expected activity of a ca2 -sensitizing
agent. in the presence of cardiac tni, no binding of  xxxd318xxx 
to the c domain of cardiac tnc was detected. our studies
demonstrate the usefulness of this system for screening compounds capable of stabilizing open/active regulatory conformations.
2. materials and methods
2.1. proteins
[15 n,2 h]ctnc and  xxxg2309xxx (1^211) were expressed and puri¢ed as previously described [9,20]. ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complexes were prepared at a known concentration, usually 0.4^0.6
mm, in 10% 2 h2 o, 20 mm tris-d11 (ph 6.8), 500 mm kcl, 10
mm cacl2 , 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm  xxxd502xxx  and 0.1 mm leupeptin.
2.2.  xxxd318xxx  titration
stock solutions of  xxxd318xxx  (sigma) were prepared fresh in 10% d4 methanol, and added in aliquots to ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc/
 xxxg2309xxx . sample ph was corrected to 6.8 as necessary. binding of  xxxd318xxx  to ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  was monitored by following
 xxxd318xxx -induced 1 hn chemical shift changes. chemical shift changes
were judged signi¢cant when they exceeded the sum of the average
plus one s.d. of all  xxxd318xxx -induced 1 hn shifts. normalized average
1
hn chemical shift data as a function of total  xxxd318xxx  were utilized to
estimate ka for drug binding.
2.3. nmr spectroscopy
experiments were carried out on a varian inova 800 mhz spectrometer. 1 h^15 n correlation experiments utilized sensitivity-enhanced
1
h^15 n hsqc-based pulse sequences [21]. data collection and processing parameters have been previously described [8].

3. results
our laboratory has developed an intact ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  model
useful for understanding structural mechanisms involved in
activation and modulation of contraction. one of the many
advantages in utilizing intact ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  for structural studies
is the ability to avoid or reduce non-speci¢c peptide and drug
interactions [22]. to further our structural understanding of
activation and modulation of the ca2 signal, we have studied
the binding of a known ca2 -sensitizing agent,  xxxd318xxx , to the
ca2 -saturated ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complex having a molecular mass
of v40 kda.
a 1:1 complex of ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc and  xxxg2309xxx 
was prepared and characterized as previously described [8].
we have previously assigned both amide proton, 1 hn , and
nitrogen,15 nh , resonances in ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc
bound to full-length  xxxg2309xxx . 1 h^15 n hsqc spectra were used
to map  xxxd318xxx  binding to ctnc during titration of ca2 saturated ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx . fig. 1 compares 1 hn chemical shift
di¡erences for ca2 -saturated ctnc bound to  xxxg2309xxx  in the
absence and presence of saturating drug. chemical shift di¡erences map primarily to defunct site i and ca2 -binding site ii
(fig. 1). no signi¢cant  xxxd318xxx -induced amide chemical shift
changes were observed in the ctnc c domain demonstrating
that any potential drug-binding sites in the c domain are
blocked in the presence of  xxxg2309xxx  (fig. 1). this is in contrast
to crystallographic studies and solution studies on free ca2 -

[15 n,2 h]ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  in the presence of saturating  xxxd318xxx . chemical
shift di¡erences were measured for 1 hn resonances of ctnc in a
0.5 mm ca2 -saturated [15 n,2 h]ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complex in the absence
and presence of 2 mm  xxxd318xxx . the horizontal line represents the

saturated ctnc where at least two c domain  xxxd318xxx -binding
sites were detected [18,19].
binding site chemical shift perturbations indicate where the
magnetic environment is changing upon addition of  xxxd318xxx .
while chemical shift changes often map to the binding interface, changes resulting from perturbation of regulatory domain equilibria may also be detected. single 1 h^15 n correlations were observed for amide protons whose chemical shift
could be followed with increasing  xxxd318xxx  concentration, consistent with fast exchange between conformational substates
relative to chemical shift di¡erences between free and drugbound forms. in addition to residues in and around sites i and
ii, chemical shift perturbations were also observed for selected
residues in the a-, b-, and d-helices (fig. 1). broadening of
1
hn resonances for ctnc residues 36^41, 50^54, 60^62, 64^
67, 74^78, and 80^86 in either the presence or absence of
saturating  xxxd318xxx  precluded mapping drug-induced chemical
shift perturbations within these regions (fig. 1). many of
these residues have been previously demonstrated to undergo
chemical exchange in several di¡erent ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complexes
[8]. the observed broadening is consistent with conformational exchange that persists even in the presence of  xxxd318xxx .
taken together, our data suggest that  xxxd318xxx -induced 1 hn
chemical shifts not only localize  xxxd318xxx  binding to the ctnc
n domain, but also reveal changes in regulatory domain conformational substates. identi¢cation of the  xxxd318xxx -binding
interface in the regulatory domain requires measurement of
distance restraints, noes, in appropriately isotope-labeled
ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complexes. in this study, the presence of protonated  xxxg2309xxx  precluded the possibility of detecting noe interactions between  xxxd318xxx  and regulatory domain 1 hn resonances.
analysis of the 1 hn chemical shift dependence with increasing concentrations of drug was used to estimate an apparent

fig. 2. the conformation of ca2 -saturated ctnc when bound to  xxxg2309xxx  is shown with regions colored to indicate 1 hn chemical shift changes
upon binding  xxxd318xxx  (a) and the  xxxg2309xxx  cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus (b). the conformation of ca2 -saturated ctnc bound to  xxxg2309xxx  was determined using long-range distance and orientation restraints (abusamhadneh, unpublished). a: calcium-saturated ctnc residues whose 1 hn
chemical shift changes in the presence of  xxxd318xxx  (fig. 1) are shown in red. b: cardiac tnc residues whose 1 hn chemical shifts are perturbed
by binding the  xxxg2309xxx  cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus are shown in yellow. residues whose 1 hn chemical shifts exhibit signi¢cant chemical shift
perturbations were obtained by comparing the absolute values of the 1 hn chemical shift di¡erences between ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx (1^80) and ctnc/phosphorylated  xxxg2309xxx (1^80) [22]. residues experiencing signi¢cant perturbations in the presence of the  xxxg2309xxx  cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus include
21, 22, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 55, 57, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 81, 84, and 90.

ka of v140 wm31 for  xxxd318xxx  binding to the ctnc regulatory domain in ca2 -saturated ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx . this value is 10fold greater than the published value for  xxxd318xxx  binding to
free ctnc [14]. at the high protein concentration used in the
nmr titrations, care must be taken to look for and minimize
non-speci¢c, weak associations. absence of  xxxd318xxx -induced
ctnc c domain chemical shifts, even in the presence of excess
drug, suggests 1 hn chemical shifts in the regulatory domain
re£ect speci¢c association. the apparent weak binding of  xxxd318xxx  to the ctnc regulatory domain in the complex may in
part explain its poor pharmacological e¡ects [14,15].
4. discussion
we have utilized our 1 hn assignments for [15 n,2 h]ctnc
bound to  xxxg2309xxx  to study  xxxd318xxx  binding and its e¡ects on
regulatory domain conformational substates. observed regulatory domain chemical shift changes map primarily to defunct site i and ca2 -binding site ii (fig. 1). both the direction and magnitude of ala-31 and asp-73 1 hn chemical shift
changes are consistent with stabilization of open regulatory
domain conformations. a similar pattern of chemical shift
perturbations has been attributed to interaction of the  xxxg2309xxx 
cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus with the ctnc regulatory domain [8,20]. observed chemical shift changes are similar to
those detected upon opening of the n domain in response
to  xxxg2309xxx (129^166) binding [23].
the apparent  xxxd318xxx -binding constant is weaker than that
determined for free ctnc [14,15,18]. several possible explanations could account for the apparent di¡erence in binding
a¤nities. analysis of the crystal structure of  xxxd318xxx  bound to

ctnc shows an overall collapsed structure. collapse of ctnc
results in all three bound  xxxd318xxx  molecules having interactions with both ctnc domains [19]. in the presence of  xxxg2309xxx ,
ctnc is more elongated and therefore it is less likely that both
ctnc domains contribute to the binding a¤nity of  xxxd318xxx 
[8,24,25]. our studies show that in the presence of  xxxg2309xxx , two
apparent  xxxd318xxx -binding sites within the c domain are
blocked (fig. 1). this observation is consistent with available
structures suggesting that c domain drug-binding sites overlap with the  xxxg2309xxx  n domain-binding site [4,19]. recently, it
has been demonstrated that both  xxxd318xxx  and a  xxxg2309xxx  regulatory peptide can bind to the isolated n domain of ctnc [26].
this observation would suggest that decreased  xxxd318xxx  a¤nity
for ctnc in the ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx  complex does not result from
competitive binding interactions. our recent comparison of
regulatory conformational substates in ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx (1^80)/
 xxxg2309xxx (129^166) and ctnc/ xxxg2309xxx (1^167) suggests that covalent
attachment of the  xxxg2309xxx  n domain to the  xxxg2309xxx  regulatory
region, via residues 81^128, modulates interactions between
the  xxxg2309xxx  regulatory region and the ctnc n domain [23],
leaving open the possibility that  xxxg2309xxx  may alter  xxxd318xxx  binding in the intact system.
we have previously demonstrated that interaction of the
 xxxg2309xxx  cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus with ctnc alters regulatory domain conformational substates, presumably toward
more open/active conformations [9,20,23]. phosphorylation of
ser-23 and ser-24 in the cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus is
thought to result in the loss of these ctnc regulatory domain
interactions. regulatory domain chemical shift changes observed upon drug binding and upon interaction with the
 xxxg2309xxx  cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus [20] suggest that both

febs 25196 26-9-01 cyaan magenta geel zwart

54

e. abusamhadneh et al./febs letters 506 (2001) 51^54

induce similar ctnc regulatory domain conformational
changes (fig. 2).  xxxd318xxx  binding to the regulatory domain
has been shown to extend the n-terminus of helix b with
formation of a side chain interaction, between glu-40 and
ser-37 [19]. these structural changes have been suggested to
stabilize defunct site i and facilitate regulatory domain opening [19]. it is interesting to speculate that the  xxxg2309xxx  cardiacspeci¢c amino-terminus also stabilizes site i and thereby increases the population of open/active conformations. thus,
the inability of site i to bind ca2 produces a conformationally active region capable of modulating the overall conformational entropy and therefore populations of apo/closed and
ca2 - xxxg2309xxx /open states. consistent with this proposal, binding
of the cardiac-speci¢c amino-terminus and  xxxd318xxx  are both
known to increase the apparent ca2 a¤nity for ca2 -binding
site ii. thus, our studies provide evidence for a conformationally active region within the ctnc regulatory domain that
may be targeted for development of ca2 -sensitizing compounds capable of increasing ca2 a¤nity in cardiac troponin.
