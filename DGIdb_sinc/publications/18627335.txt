introduction

 xxxd253xxx  is an example of an ‘old’ drug that has found new life in the modern
era. synthesized in 1964 as a potentially improved version of  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd253xxx 
was developed as a cytidine analog that did not require activation by  xxxd1836xxx 
kinase, thus bypassing one of the known signaling pathways that confers
resistance to  xxxd1790xxx  in some leukemias [1,2]. this nucleoside was ultimately a
disappointment in treating acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) [3-7]. more
recently, however, the emerging field of ‘therapeutic epigenetics’ and the
appreciation that the hypomethylating properties of this drug can translate into
clinical benefit has led to the widespread use of this agent to treat the
myelodysplastic syndromes [8,9].
the term ‘epigenetic’ refers to the inheritance of genetic information on the
basis of gene expression levels that is mediated by mechanisms other than changing
the primary nucleotide sequence of the dna. such mechanisms include
methylation of clusters of cpgs (known as ‘cpg-islands’) in the promoter region
of genes, histone modification and chromatin remodeling. due to limitations of
space, and given the complexity of these epigenetic mechanisms, several excellent
reviews of cancer epigenetics are cited for the interested reader [10-14].
 xxxd253xxx  was the first chemotherapeutic agent approved by us food and
drug administration (fda) for the treatment of all subtypes of myelodysplastic
syndromes (mds) [15]. moreover,  xxxd253xxx  was one of the first in a new class
of drugs, the hypomethylating agents. these drugs represent a significant clinical
advance in the treatment of mds, as they are among a small number of
chemotherapy agents that have been shown to change the natural history of mds
and, in fact, to prolong survival. here, we review the evolution of the use of
 xxxd253xxx  for the treatment of human disease and highlight its function as the
first clinically significant form of therapeutic epigenetic modulation.

pharmacology

 xxxd253xxx  is a cytidine analog that differs from the parent
compound by the incorporation of a nitrogen at the fifth
position of the heterocyclic ring (figure 1). the chemical
name is  xxxd253xxx .
the empirical formula is c8h12n4o5. the molecular
weight is 244. the alteration of the heterocyclic ring is
thought, in part, to contribute to the important property
of hypomethylating areas that regulate gene expression,
and it also renders the ring chemically unstable [16]. hence,
the formulation used clinically is generally administered
within a few hours of reconstitution [4]. degradation of the
parent compound is thought to be accomplished by cytidine
deaminase, and while the metabolites of the parent
compound have been identified, they are not well-defined in
terms of their clinical significance [17].
in the initial studies of patients with aml, the  xxxd253xxx 
was administered as a bolus infusion [3,5]. severe nausea
and vomiting limited the drug’s use when administered
in this manner, and subsequent studies favored
administration of  xxxd253xxx  as a continuous intravenous
(i.v.) infusion [4,7,18]. the continuous infusion regimen
is reminiscent of the schedules used to administer
 xxxd1790xxx . significant gastrointestinal toxicity was still
observed with continuous infusion dosing, and ultimately
investigators explored lower doses using a subcutaneous (s.c.)
route of administration [19,20].
in patients with mds, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd253xxx 
were studied in six patients following a single 75 mg/m2 s.c.
dose and a single 75 mg/m2 i.v. dose [21].  xxxd253xxx  was
rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration. the peak plasma
concentration of 750 + 403 etag/ml occurred in 0.5 h. the
bioavailability of s.c.  xxxd253xxx  relative to i.v.  xxxd253xxx  is
1982

approximately 89%, based on the area under the curve. the
drug is widely distributed in the tissue, with the mean
volume of distribution following i.v. dosing of 76l. mean
apparent s.c. clearance is 167 + 49 l/h. the plasma half-life
is approximately 22 min after i.v. infusion and approximately
41 min after s.c. administration. drug interaction studies
with  xxxd253xxx  have not been conducted and it is unknown
whether  xxxd253xxx  inhibits cytochrome p450 enzymes.
the known pharmacokinetic data were derived from
studies of [14c]-labeled drug, not from determinations of
 xxxd253xxx  metabolite concentrations. urinary excretion is
the primary route of elimination of  xxxd253xxx  and its
metabolites (85% after i.v. dosing and approximately 50%
after s.c. administration). less than 1% of the labeled
 xxxd253xxx  is excreted in the feces. the mean elimination
half-life of radiolabeled  xxxd253xxx  is approximately 4 h
after i.v. or s.c. administration. measurements of radioactivity
in the cns, however, suggest relatively poor penetration of
the drug.
 xxxd253xxx  enters the cell through a facilitative transport
mechanism and is activated to a triphosphate form, which
competes with ctp for incorporation into rna, thereby
producing a number of disruptive effects on rna and
protein metabolism and ultimately resulting in cytotoxcity.
 xxxd253xxx  also may be incorporated into dna, although
to a lesser degree than its incorporation into rna. the
dna incorporation, however, may confer the important
clinical effect of the drug, since  xxxd253xxx  is thought to
inhibit dna methyltransferase(s). these enzymes, in turn,
modulate the methylation status of key cytosine residues
and alter the expression of a variety of genes. by removing
the methylation-induced gene suppression that resulted in
the aberrant or neoplastic phenotype, the normal physiologic
‘wild type’ phenotype is restored.

o’dwyer & maslak

while such a model may be, in part, a simplification of
the clinical effect of the drug, it is the area of epigenetics
and the therapeutic modulation of these processes that has
been the focus of most of the current clinical investigations.
while the ‘de-repression’ of key genes silenced in malignancy
represents one potential mechanism of action, investigators
have also cited potential modulation of genes that stimulate
immune recognition or effects on stem cells as well as
modifications in histones to explain the biologic actions of
the drug [22]. the difference between the biologic and
cytotoxic effects of  xxxd253xxx  is associated with the dose [23].
in vitro, lower concentrations were associated with
the induction of differentiation in cell lines. at higher
concentrations (> 16 µmol/l) cytotoxic effects are predominant.
the drug has the greatest effect on actively dividing cells in
the s phase and relatively little effect on non-dividing
cells [24,25]. in vivo, dose response curves suggest a biphasic
response in both leukemia and normal cells, suggesting more
than a single potential mechanism for the cytotoxic effects [2].
3.

toxicity

just as the clinical effects of  xxxd253xxx  vary with the dose
administered and the route of administration, so too does
the toxicity profile. as mentioned previously, the initial
aml studies observed severe nausea and vomiting with
bolus administration. as the drug was used at lower
continuous doses, significant gastrointestinal toxicity was
observed. additionally, prolonged myelosuppression was
observed. the decrease in peripheral blood counts following
initiation of therapy were subsequently accompanied by a
rise in these counts, however, as patients demonstrated a
clinical response. in patients with previously existing hepatic
disease, profound hepatotoxicity was observed. more
rare complications included transient fever, skin reaction
or pruritus at the site of injection and transient
hypotension associated with bolus administration. in
addition, a neuromuscular syndrome was reported by one
group using higher doses (200 mg/m2) administered via
an i.v. bolus [26].
in a large multi-center mds trial, the most common
adverse reactions reported following i.v. administration
were petechiae (45.8%), weakness (35.4%), rigors (35.4%)
and hypokalemia (31.3%). the most common adverse
reactions reported by s.c. administration were nausea
(70.5%), anemia (69.5%), thrombocytopenia (65.5%),
vomiting (54.1%), pyrexia (51.8%), leukopenia (48.2%),
diarrhea (36.4%), fatigue (35.9%), injection site erythema
(35.0%), constipation (33.6%), neutropenia (32.3%) and
ecchymosis (30.5%) [27].
4.

clinical studies

as discussed above, the initial intention in developing
 xxxd253xxx  was to provide a cytidine analog that did not

require activation by  xxxg611xxx  and, thus, to
overcome a pathway by which some leukemias developed
resistance. hence, many of the first studies explored its use
in patients with relapsed/refractory disease [5-7,26,28]. doses
ranged from 150 – 750 mg/m2, with response rates generally
reported around 20%. longer infusion rates seemed to be
more efficacious than short bolus administration and also
produced less toxicity. overall, the clinical trials were
disappointing, as the outcomes were similar to other
available treatment regimens, and  xxxd253xxx  alone or
in combination failed to establish itself as a standard
therapy for this indication.
the recent emergence of epigenetics as an important
mechanism of carcinogenesis and the recognition of the
biologic effects of  xxxd253xxx  prompted renewed interest in
its clinical use. the first studies in which  xxxd253xxx  was
used to modulate gene expression and produce a
meaningful clinical effect were not in mds but in the
hemoglobinopathies [29-32]. animal studies had originally
demonstrated an increase in fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in
baboons that were treated with  xxxd253xxx . the production
of hbf is thought to be important, as it is a physiologic
counter-weight to the defective adult hemoglobin produced
in these disorders. patients with beta-thalassemia can become
symptomatic at the time the fetal hemoglobin genes are
silenced and production of this form of hemoglobin ceases.
several reports highlighted the ability of  xxxd253xxx  to
partially treat disease by inducing the production of hbf
resulting in more effective hematopoiesis [29,30]. laboratory
correlates of some of these studies included hypomethylation
of bone marrow dna near the hbg2 (gamma-globin) gene
promoter, as well as an increase in gamma-globin messenger
rna, supporting the hypothesis of therapeutic epigenetic
modulation. although initially promising, the concern over
toxicity and the potential carcinogenic effect prevented the
widespread adoption of  xxxd253xxx  for this indication. the
induction of hbf can be accomplished instead by other
drugs with potentially less toxicity.
nevertheless, the observation regarding the clinical
application of a hypomethylating agent laid the groundwork
for the use of such drugs in malignancy. hematologic
malignancies, in particular, have been noted to have
highly aberrant methylation patterns. the myelodysplastic
syndromes have long been recognized as a diverse group
of malignant disorders that are difficult to treat.
although previously labeled ‘preleukemia’, the standard
cytotoxic approaches used as anti-leukemia therapy have
limited efficacy. therefore, alternative approaches including
agents that exploited the biology of the underlying process
and induced differentiation were sought to treat these
diseases. the discovery that the methylation status of the
p15( xxxg422xxx ) gene in mds was related to disease progression
provided the rationale to investigate whether altering
the methylation patterns could impact on the natural
history of the disease [33].

 xxxd253xxx 

the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb) has
conducted two phase ii (calbg 8421 and calbg 8921)
studies of single agent low-dose  xxxd253xxx  [34,35]. the
calgb 8421 trial enrolled patients with mds to receive
 xxxd253xxx  75 mg/m2/day continuous infusion for 14 days.
forty-nine per cent of patients (21/43 evaluable patients)
had some type of response. five patients (12%) had complete
normalization of bone marrow and peripheral blood counts,
that is complete remission (cr). eleven patients (25%) had
a partial remission (> 50% restoration of the deficit from
normal of all three peripheral blood lineages, elimination of
transfusion requirements and a decrease in the percentage of
bone marrow blasts by ≥ 50%). five patients (12%) had a
hematologic improvement (> 50% restoration in the deficit
from normal of one or more peripheral blood cell lines
and/or a ≥ 50% decrease in transfusion requirements).
the second phase ii study (calgb 8921) enrolled patients
with mds to receive  xxxd253xxx  s.c. 75mg/m2/day [27,35].
similar response rates were reported.
these results led to the development of the calgb
study 9221, a randomized, open-label, phase iii, multicenter trial [36]. in this study 99 patients were randomized
to  xxxd253xxx  treatment, and 92 patients were randomized
to best supportive care.  xxxd253xxx  was administered
75 mg/m2 s.c. for 7 days in a 28-day cycle. study
patients included any of the five mds subtypes of the
french-american-british (fab) classification. patients in
the supportive care arm were crossed over to receive
 xxxd253xxx  if they had disease progression, and approximately
55% of patients in the supportive care arm did cross over to
the  xxxd253xxx  treatment arm. the primary efficacy end
point was the overall response rate (defined in the study as
cr + pr) and was found to be approximately 32%
(7% cr, 16% pr) while an additional 37% were able to
achieve hematologic improvement. as expected, no patients
in the supportive care arm sustained any sort of response. in
addition, 23% of treated patients who were transfusiondependent at the time of enrolment and had a response to
the therapy, no longer required transfusion support. the
responses were sustained with a median duration of
approximately 18 months. transformation to aml was
observed in only 15% of the  xxxd253xxx -treated group,
compared with 38% in the supportive care cohort.
importantly, treatment was well tolerated, with a treatmentrelated mortality of < 1%. there were no relevant differences
in the frequency of adverse events observed in patients
65 years and older compared to the younger patients.
however, one important question remained unanswered:
does  xxxd253xxx  treatment change survival in mds? because
this question could not be addressed by the calbg 9221
trial due to the crossover design, the international  xxxd253xxx 
high-risk mds survival study group designed a clinical
trial to specifically ask whether  xxxd253xxx  treatment has a
survival benefit. the preliminary results from the aza-001
phase iii multi-center, international, randomized trial were
1984

reported at the 2007 annual meeting of the american
society of hematology [37]. the study evaluated 358 patients
with high-risk mds, based on an independent review of
fab subtypes or international prognostic scoring system
(ipss) classification. one hundred seventy-nine patients were
randomized to treatment with  xxxd253xxx  75 mg/m2/day s.c.
for seven days every 28 days and 179 patients were randomized
to conventional care regimens (ccr). patients assigned to ccr
could receive either best supportive care alone (n = 105),
low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  (n = 49), or standard chemotherapy (n = 25).
the analysis showed that  xxxd253xxx  demonstrated a survival
advantage over ccr (24.4 months vs. 15 months, p = 0.0001),
with a median follow-up of 21.1 months. at two years,
 xxxd253xxx  demonstrated a twofold survival advantage when
compared to ccr (51% vs 26%, p = 0.0001).
one of the difficulties in extrapolating data from some of
these studies is that not only have the definitions for response
changed over the last few years, but the criteria by which
mds and aml are diagnosed have undergone revision as
well. in a effort to account for some of these changes,
silverman et al. reanalyzed the calgb 8421, 8921 and
9221 data using the world health organization (who)
classification for mds and aml, as well as the international
working group (iwg) criteria for response in mds [27].
complete remission was seen in 10 – 17% of  xxxd253xxx 
treated patients, while 23 – 36% of those patients had
hematologic improvement validating the findings from the
prior analysis. interestingly, of those patients who were
reclassified as having aml under who criteria, 35 – 48%
of them had hematologic improvement or a better response
with a median survival of 19.3 months. these results point
towards some form of clinical benefit that may not be
apparent using standard aml response criteria and suggest
a role for similar dosing of  xxxd253xxx  in treating aml.
such studies are currently underway.

expert opinion

the introduction of  xxxd253xxx  into the clinic changed the
approach to the treatment of mds and ushered in the era
of therapeutic epigenetics. more recently, a second agent,
 xxxd1823xxx  (5-aza-2′  xxxd1836xxx ), received fda approval
for mds therapy and became available for clinical use [38-41].
both agents are cytidine analogs and largely act through
their ability to demethylate key areas of specific gene
promoter regions, thereby facilitating the renewed expression
of those previously repressed genes. this mechanism is in
marked contrast to the mode of action of  xxxd1790xxx , which
is primarily thought to be of clinical benefit by virtue of its
cytotoxic effects. in aml, complete remission is achieved by
inducing marrow aplasia, temporarily eradicating the leukemic
clone and having the normal hematopoietic progenitors
repopulate the bone marrow and peripheral blood. the
application of this model to mds has been problematic, as
most patients fail aml induction-style therapy.

o’dwyer & maslak

the paradigm for therapy and response in mds has
largely changed based on the experience with  xxxd253xxx  and
 xxxd1823xxx . although some patients respond in the classic
sense by achieving cr, clinical benefit may also be obtained
by a decrease in transfusion requirements and relative
freedom from progression of disease manifested by
a transformation to aml. such effects have now
been incorporated into revised treatment response criteria
for mds [42].
the manner in which response is achieved in mds also
differs from the aml paradigm. successful induction
therapy requires one to two courses of chemotherapy to
achieve maximal clinical response. therapy with the
hypomethylating agents may require multiple courses of
therapy before a clinical benefit is seen. although an
initial reduction in peripheral blood counts may occur,
successful therapy is marked by a relative restoration of
normal hematopoiesis.
while the introduction of these hypomethylating agents
has changed the therapy of mds, most patients who
demonstrate initial responses to treatment ultimately relapse
and, thus, the treatment cannot be considered curative.
such results underscore the inherent complexity underlying
the pharmacologic manipulation of selective genetic
expression that results in restoration of the normal phenotype.

research presented at the 2007 annual meeting of the
american society of hematology emphasized this point.
figueroa et al., using a pcr-based assay, demonstrated
498 genes that were differentially methylated in patients
with mds as compared to aml, suggesting that there is
significant genome-wide epigenetic deregulation and that
much remains to be learned in order to identify the precise
pathways implicated in the disease process [43].
the recognition that dna methylation is tied to both
histone deacetylation and histone methylation and that these
processes all interact to modulate chromatin modification
and effect genetic expression has led to the development of
several other classes of drugs for use as epigenetic modulators.
several studies have combined histone deacetylators with
hypomethylating agents in an effort to amplify biologic
response and improve clinical efficacy [22,44-46]. although
several interesting biologic correlates have been observed, no
one regimen has emerged as an optimal therapy. hence,
investigations into the therapeutic modulation of cancer
epigenetics will continue to evolve as discoveries are made in
the biology underlying the disease.
