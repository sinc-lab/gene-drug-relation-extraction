abstract
the objective of this investigation was to determine whether celecoxib, a highly specific inhibitor of  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2), inhibits the promotion phase of mammary tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufas) that is known to induce cox-2 expression. sixty female sprague–dawley rats were initially maintained on an
ain-93g diet. at 50 days of age they received a single i.p. injection of  xxxd2685xxx  (mnu). one week later, all rats were
switched to a modified ain-93g diet containing 18% safflower oil plus 3%  xxxd3230xxx . half of the rats also began receiving
1500 ppm celecoxib in the diet and the control and experimental diets were continued for a further 23 weeks. celecoxib
significantly decreased both the final tumor incidence (63.3% in the celecoxib group versus 82.2% in the control group,
p , 0:05) and tumor multiplicity (0.9 ^ 0.2 tumors/rat in the celecoxib group versus 2.3 ^ 0.3 tumors/rat in the control
group, p , 0:05). at the termination of the experiment, body weights were significantly lower in the celecoxib group compared
to controls (330.6 ^ 6.1 versus 401.5 ^ 10.9 g respectively, p , 0:05) although there was no evidence of toxicity and food
intakes were not different for the two groups. fasting serum triglycerides and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation were
lower in the celecoxib group compared to controls (49.3 ^ 4.4 versus 82.8 ^ 12.6 mg/dl, p , 0:05, and 7.2 ^ 0.3 versus
11.3 ^ 0.4% of body weight, p , 0:01, respectively). these results show that administration of celecoxib to rats in a high fat
diet rich in n-6 pufas suppresses the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis induced by mnu. this inhibition may be due to
the effects of celecoxib on lipid metabolism as well as cox-2. q 2002 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

tumors and tumor cell lines from humans and rodents
contain elevated levels of prostaglandins compared to
the normal tissues from which they arise [1,2]. inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) hinders the development of chemically-induced as well as transplantable
mammary tumors [3–5]. indeed, recent epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association

between regular use of nsaids and the relative risk
of breast cancer [6,7].
the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin
biosynthesis is cyclooxygenase (cox). there are
two cox isoforms, a constitutive gene, cox-1, and
an inducible gene, cox-2. proinflammatory agents,
growth factors, tumor promoters and mitogens induce
cox-2 expression [8,9]. the transcription of cox-2
is enhanced in transformed mammary epithelial cells
[10]. a recent study has shown that expression of
cox-2 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice [11]. approximately 50% of human breast
tumors express cox-2 [12,13]. we have recently
shown that dietary n-6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
(pufas) that promote mammary gland carcinogenesis in experimental animals [14] induce cox-2
expression in rat mammary glands [15]. evidence
linking the effects of dietary fat on mammary carcinogenesis to prostaglandin synthesis also derives from
the observation that nsaids that inhibit both cox-1
and cox-2 inhibit the promoting effects of diets rich
in n-6 pufas [16,17]. furthermore, the n-6 pufa
linoleic acid is a precursor of the prostaglandin 2
series that are known to be mitogenic for normal
human and rodent mammary epithelial cells [18].
harris et al. [19] have shown that celecoxib, a new
nsaid that has a high specificity for inhibiting cox2, possesses strong chemopreventive activity against
rat mammary carcinogenesis induced by 7,12dimethylbez[a]anthracene (dmba). in that study,
celecoxib administration began 7 days prior to carcinogen treatment. since cox activity can contribute to
the oxidative metabolism of drugs and carcinogens
[20,21], it is unclear whether celecoxib is inhibiting
the metabolism of dmba, promotion of tumorigenesis, or both. moreover, harris et al. [19] used a low
fat chow diet that may not have induced cox-2
expression. another study has shown chemoprevention by the cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd2727xxx  of rat
mammary tumorigenesis initiated by 2-amino-1methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine ( xxxd23xxx ) [22].
in that study, the rats received a high fat diet (23.5%
corn oil), but again it is unclear whether  xxxd2727xxx 
inhibits  xxxd23xxx  metabolism, tumor promotion, or both.
the objective of the present study, therefore, was to
provide further evidence for the role of cox-2 in
mammary carcinogenesis by examining the effects
of celecoxib on the promotion phase of mammary

tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet rich in n-6
pufas that is known to induce cox-2 expression.

2. materials and methods
2.1. tumor induction protocol
female sprague–dawley rats (43 days old),
purchased from charles river laboratories (st
constant, québec, canada) were housed at
22 ^ 28c, 50% humidity with a 12-h light-dark
cycle. tap water was provided ad libitum throughout
the experiment. the rats were acclimatized for 1
week on an ain-93g diet. at 50 days of age, they
were given a single i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg
 xxxd2685xxx  (mnu, sigma chemical co, st
louis, mo) dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid in normal
saline and used within 30 min of preparation. after
maintaining the animals for a week on the ain-93g
diet, they were randomized into control and experimental groups (30/group) and fed a modified ain93g diet containing 18% safflower oil and 3%
 xxxd3230xxx  at the expense of carbohydrate [15], or
this diet supplemented with 1500 ppm celecoxib
( xxxd457xxx , kindly supplied by searle, skokie, il).
thereafter, animals were weighed and palpated for
mammary lesions weekly. a total of 15 weeks after
mnu administration, ten rats from each group were
randomly selected for the measurement of food
intake over a period of 5 days. also at 15 weeks
after mnu exposure, ten randomly chosen rats
from each group were fasted overnight, 400 ml
blood collected from the tail vein the following
morning and serum triglycerides levels measured
enzymatically using sigma diagnostics triglyceride
(gpo-trinder) reagent (sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo). moribund animals, those with tumors
.20 mm in diameter, or those remaining 24 weeks
after mnu administration were killed and the lesions
resected. all internal organs were examined at
autopsy. abdominal adipose tissue was excised and
weighed. all tumors plus representative samples of
liver, kidney, stomach and duodenum were fixed in
10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and
processed for histopathological evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining. serum levels of celecoxib
were kindly measured by dr ben zweifel (pharma-

cia, chesterfield, mo) using high-performance liquid
chromatography [19].
2.2. statistical analysis
differences in average numbers of tumors/rat were
determined using mann–whitney test and differences
in final body weights, food intakes, serum triglycerides and abdominal adipose tissue mass were determined using student’s t-test. tumor incidences were
compared using the x 2 test.
3. results
the effects of celecoxib on mammary tumor development over a period of 24 weeks following administration of 50 mg/kg mnu are shown in figs. 1 and 2.
the drug produced a significant reduction in the final
mammary tumor incidence (63.3% in the celecoxib
group versus 82.8% in the control group, p , 0:05)
and the average numbers of tumors/rat (0.9 ^ 0.2 in
the celecoxib group versus 2.3 ^ 0.3 in the control
group, p , 0:01). the administration of celecoxib
also increased the latency for tumor induction such
that the tumor incidence reached 50% in the celecoxib-treated rats in 21 weeks compared to 12
weeks in the control group. histopathological examination of all 36 tumors from the celecoxib group
showed that 31 were adenocarcinomas, and five
were non-malignant fibroadenomas. as expected
from our own work [23] and that of others [24],
tumors in the control group were all adenocarcinomas.
body weights over the course of the experiment
were significantly lower in the celecoxib-treated
group compared to controls (fig. 3) such that at the
termination of the experiment, the treated rats had
approximately 17% lower weights than the controls.
in order to determine whether this difference in body
weight gain was caused by differences in food intake
between the two groups, we measured food consumption during the 15th week following mnu administration. food intake was not different between the
control (12.1 ^ 0.2 g/rat per day) and celecoxib
(13.1 ^ 0.3 g/rat per day) groups.
at the end of the 15th week, we showed that the
fasting serum triglycerides levels in the celecoxib
group were lower than the control group (49.3 ^ 4.4
versus 82.8 ^ 12.6 mg/dl, p , 0:05). at the termina-

1500 ppm celecoxib beginning 1 week after mnu administration.

tion of the experiment, the weight of abdominal
adipose tissue as a % of body weight in the rats given
celecoxib was significantly lower than in the control
group (7.2 ^ 0.3 versus 11.3 ^ 0.4%, p , 0:01).
at autopsy, we examined all of the animals for
signs of toxicity induced by celecoxib. we observed
no gross changes in any tissue and no histological
changes in liver, kidney, stomach or upper intestinal
tract. furthermore, serum g-glutamyl transferase (ggt) levels were not different in control and treated
rats. serum levels of celecoxib ranged from 10.5 to
24.4 mg/ml (mean value 14.5 mg/ml).
4. discussion
the purpose of this investigation was to determine
whether celecoxib inhibits the promotion of
mammary tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet
rich in n-6 pufas. to achieve this goal, we induced
mammary gland tumors in rats by a single i.p. injection of the direct-acting carcinogen mnu rather than
the carcinogen dmba that requires metabolic activation and was used in a related study [19]. in this way,

any differences in carcinogen metabolism that may be
caused by differences in cox activity are avoided
[20,21]. furthermore, we began to administer celecoxib to the animals 1 week after carcinogen administration rather than prior to the carcinogen as in the
other study [19]. thus, the celecoxib in our protocol
could only affect post-initiation events. as is clear
from figs. 1 and 2, we found significant reductions
in both tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity in the
celecoxib group compared to the controls. these
results suggest that celecoxib, when given in a high
fat diet rich in n-6 pufas that has been shown to
induce the expression of cox-2 in the rat mammary
gland [15], acts to inhibit the promotion phase of
mammary tumorigenesis.
the interpretation of our experiment, however, is
complicated by the unexpected lower body weight
gain in the celecoxib-treated animals compared to
the controls. we chose the dose of 1500 ppm celecoxib based on previous experiments that showed no
effect of this dose on the body weights of treated rats
[19,25]. in these experiments, however, the drug was
administered in low fat diets. we showed that celecoxib given in our high fat diet gave blood levels that
were about three times higher than those obtained
with the same dose of the drug in a low fat diet
[19]. presumably, the high fat diet leads to high rate
of absorption of the drug. there were, however, no
indications of toxicity in any tissues of the treated
animals. furthermore, when we measured food intake
at 15 weeks post-mnu, there were no differences
between treated and control rats. two of our results
suggest that celecoxib may be having an effect on
lipid metabolism. we showed that celecoxib-treated
rats accumulated significantly less abdominal adipose
tissue than controls and had lower levels of fasting
serum triglycerides. at this stage, the mechanism by
which celecoxib produces these effects on lipid metabolism is not known. the mechanism may, of course,
be independent of cox-2. indeed, homozygous or
heterozygous deletions of either cox-1 or cox-2
have recently been shown to have no effect on lipid
metabolism in insulin-resistant mice [26].
although the celecoxib-treated rats were not
deprived of energy, it is of interest to compare our
results with the inhibitory effect on mammary tumorigenesis of weight gain reductions induced by caloric
restriction. similar reductions in body weight gain

s. lu et al. / cancer letters 184 (2002) 7–12

(15%, induced by chronic food restriction) to those we
observed (17%) have been shown to decrease tumor
multiplicity by 26% without affecting tumor incidence
[27]. we observed a 61% decrease in tumor multiplicity as well as a 24% reduction in tumor incidence. it is
clear, therefore, that the reduction in body weight gain
that we observed, even if it led to inhibition of carcinogenesis, could only account for a small part of the
total inhibitory effect of celecoxib.
in summary, administration of celecoxib to rats in a
high fat diet rich in n-6 pufas suppressed the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis induced by mnu.
both the incidence and multiplicity of tumors were
inhibited. the inhibition may be due to the effects
of celecoxib on lipid metabolism as well as cox-2.
