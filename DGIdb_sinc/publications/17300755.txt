and  xxxg515xxx  polymorphisms in major depressive
disorder

background: anger and irritability are prominent in a subset of individuals with major depressive disorder (mdd). phosphorylation of the
transcription factor  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) response element binding protein (creb) has been associated with aggression or reward/aversion in rodents, and markers near  xxxg515xxx  have been linked to mdd. therefore, we examined the association between
 xxxg515xxx  polymorphisms and anger expression in mdd.
methods: a clinical sample of 94 caucasian outpatients with mdd (42 male, 52 female) completed the spielberger state-trait anger
expression inventory. we examined six tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) spanning  xxxg515xxx  and flanking regions for association with a summary measure of frequency and intensity of anger expression. we also introduced a novel statistical method to dissect the
independent effect of individual snps and haplotypes.
results: for the sample as a whole, one of six snps tested was significantly associated with anger expression (empirical p ⫽ .003). among
the male subsample, this association was particularly marked (empirical p ⫽ 8 ⫻ 10⫺5). a global haplotype test of the six snps was likewise
significant (p ⫽ 3.7 ⫻ 10⫺6). no single snp or haplotype accounted for all of the association observed.
conclusion: these preliminary results suggest a strong, gender-specific association between variation at the  xxxg515xxx  locus and anger
expression in mdd.

context of depression. the gene coding for cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) response element binding protein-1
( xxxg515xxx ) is of particular interest, because its product plays a key
role in neuronal (and other cellular) signal transduction and has
been implicated in animal models of emotional reactivity and
aggression (barrot et al. 2002, 2005; david et al. 2004; pandey
2003) as well as reward and aversion circuits (barrot et al. 2005;
carlezon et al. 2005; dong et al. 2006; mcclung and nestler 2003;
pliakas et al. 2001). in humans,  xxxg515xxx  has been implicated in
mood disorders (manier et al. 2001; zubenko et al. 2003), suicide
(dwivedi et al. 2003; odagaki et al. 2001; young et al. 2004), and
antidepressant response (dowlatshahi et al. 1998; koch et al.
2002; yamada et al. 2003). in addition, markers near the  xxxg515xxx 
locus have been reported to cosegregate with recurrent, earlyonset mdd in women (zubenko et al. 2003).
we therefore examined the possible association between
polymorphisms in the region of the  xxxg515xxx  gene and variation in
anger expression in a cohort of patients with nonpsychotic mdd.
in light of evidence of gender-specific differences in both anger
expression (fava et al. 1995; perlis et al. 2005; spielberger 1996)
and in the association between creb and mood disorders
(zubenko et al. 2003), we hypothesized differential effects in
male and female subjects.

rritability is increasingly recognized as a common symptom
during major depressive episodes, with two studies finding
that approximately 40% of depressed outpatients with major
depressive disorder (mdd) reported significant irritability
(benazzi 2005; perlis et al. 2005). differences in anger expression
or level of hostility seem to have clinical implications: they have
been associated with risk for suicide attempts or ideation (cautin
et al. 2001; conner et al. 2004; horesh et al. 1997; oquendo et al.
2000; osvath et al. 2004; perlis et al. 2005; placidi et al. 2001;
romanov et al. 1994) as well as cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality (chang et al. 2002; eng et al. 2003; fava et al. 1996;
gallacher et al. 1999; jorgensen and houston 1988; mittleman
et al. 1995; perlis et al. 2005; shapiro et al. 2000; williams et al.
2001). irritable depression also seems to have distinct neurobiological correlates, including differences in amygdala and
ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation (dougherty et al.
2004; fava et al. 2000).
twin studies suggest that aspects of anger expression and
proneness to irritability display heritability comparable to that of
mdd itself (cates et al. 1993; coccaro et al. 1993, 1997; wang
et al. 2005). although a few specific loci have been associated
with anger and aggression (manuck et al. 1999; rujescu et al.
2002), little is known about the genetic basis of anger in the

subjects
a clinical sample of 94 caucasian outpatients with nonpsychotic mdd (42 male, 52 female) was recruited from consecutive
individuals presenting before beginning outpatient treatment in a
depression research program. diagnosis was confirmed by structured clinical interview for dsm-iv (scid; first et al. 1996):
inclusion required that subjects meet criteria for a current nonpsychotic major depressive episode. all subjects signed written
informed consent before study entry. the study protocol and

assessment
the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d-17;
hamilton 1960) was completed by an experienced psychiatrist or
psychologist.
all subjects completed the spielberger state-trait anger expression inventory–2 (staxi-2), which has been validated in
both psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations (spielberger
1996). the anger expression index (ax) provides a summary
measure of experience of angry feelings, with four subscales
examining inward and outward anger expression and control.
genotyping
we first identified all single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in
a region including  xxxg515xxx  and flanking regions (115 kb in all) with
the international hapmap project database (http://www.hapmap.
org), which yielded a total of 53 snps. the tagger program (de
bakker et al. 2005), which examines pairwise and multiallelic
linkage disequilibrium (ld) to determine the minimum set of
snps necessary to capture all common genetic variation in a
region, identified five tags sufficient to capture all but one of the
phase ii hapmap snps (in pairwise or multiallelic tests) in
 xxxg515xxx , with a minimum r2 of .8 (mean r2 .93) (supplement 1);
one additional snp, further 5’ to  xxxg515xxx , was also included for
consistency with prior experiments.
genotyping of snps in the region of  xxxg515xxx  was performed
with the methods previously described (sklar et al. 2002).
primers were designed with spectrodesigner software (sequenom, san diego, california). polymerase chain reaction was
performed, followed by homogeneous massextend reaction.
samples were analyzed in automated mode by a massarray rt
mass spectrometer (sequenom) (buetow et al. 2001). the resulting spectra were analyzed by spectrotyper software (sequenom) after baseline correction and peak identification. in the
present study, the six snps yielded pass rates ⱖ 97% and did not
deviate significantly from hardy-weinberg equilibrium. typical
intra- and inter-plate control samples on this platform have
yielded error rates ⬍ .1%.
analysis
single snp. we used the software package whap (http://
pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/whap/) to perform single snp
association tests. the regression-based method implemented in
whap (sham et al. 2004) was recently found to perform well in
a comprehensive simulation study comparing different haplotype-based methods for case/control association analysis (cordell 2006). for each snp, we calculated empirical significance
values on the basis of 50,000 permutations. these ensure that
deviation from normality or small sample size will not cause false
positives; furthermore, by comparing each observed statistic with
the maximum of all six statistics for each permuted dataset, we
can obtain a set of significance values adjusted for the multiple
testing of six correlated snps. we also formally tested for
gender-related heterogeneity in the association with  xxxg515xxx  (i.e.,
the gene ⫻ gender interaction). population mean and variance
for quantitative traits were drawn from those previously reported
for psychiatric populations (spielberger 1999).
haplotype and conditional testing. haplotype analyses
were conducted with whap. the initial haplotype test is an
omnibus test for any joint effect of all haplotypes observed
(minor allele frequencies [maf] ⬎ .01). whap accounts for

ambiguity in inferred haplotypes with a weighted likelihood
approach to test for association conditional on the posterior
distribution of possible haplotypic phases given the multilocus
genotype for each individual. where the omnibus test was
significant, we performed haplotype-specific tests of each haplotype versus all others.
such haplotype-specific tests do not clearly identify whether
one or multiple haplotypes are associated with phenotype,
however: a single associated haplotype could give rise to multiple haplotype-specific results, because it features in every test,
either as the test haplotype or as part of the pool of reference
haplotypes. therefore, whap allows for conditional testing,
which collectively can help to better characterize an association.
first, an “independent effect” test was performed for each snp
(i.e., testing the single snp effect conditional on the haplotype
background). a significant result would indicate that a snp has
an effect independent of the rest of the variation in the  xxxg515xxx 
gene. we also performed a second conditional test, the “sole
variant” test. rather than asking “is x still associated when we
control for everything else?” as in the independent effect test, we
ask “is everything else still associated when we control for x?”
given a significant omnibus test result, we would interpret a
nonsignificant sole-variant test result as consistent with the
hypothesis that a particular snp is the sole-variant, because
controlling for it eliminates the omnibus signal.
phenotypic testing
to exclude possible confounders, analyses were repeated
with adjustment for depression severity (measured by ham17) or
comorbid diagnoses. we also examined in an exploratory fashion the association between the snp most strongly associated
with ax (rs4675690) and the four individual anger subscales.

results
for the sample as a whole, mean age was 39.2 ⫾ 12.2 years,
and mean ham17 at study entry was 20.6 ⫾ 4.0. the dsm-iv
comorbidity included lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder
(ptsd) (4%), current ptsd (3%), lifetime panic disorder (16%),
current panic disorder (12%), and lifetime substance use disorders (31%); no subjects reported current substance use disorders.
in terms of subtype, 25 (27%) met criteria for atypical depression,
and 57 (61%) had experienced at least one prior episode.
results of single snp tests for association with the quantitative
anger phenotype are reported in table 1 along with maf. the
snp 6 (rs4675690) was associated in the full sample (empirical
p value ⫽ .003); differences in anger expression score by
genotype are illustrated in figure 1.
on the basis of this single snp result, we performed planned
gender-specific analyses. the pattern of results for men versus
women was strikingly different, with association exclusively in
men. three of six snps showed significant evidence for gene ⫻
gender interaction (table 1; repeating all analyses adjusting for
hamd or comorbid axis i disorder yielded similar results; not
shown). given the strong gender-specific nature of the results,
subsequent follow-up analyses were only performed for men
(n ⫽ 42).
an initial haplotype analysis incorporated all six snps in an
omnibus test for any joint effect of the nine haplotypes observed
(maf ⬎ .01). the omnibus result was highly significant [␹2(8) ⫽
39.656, p ⫽ 3.7 ⫻ 10⫺6], so we performed haplotype-specific
tests (table 1). these indicated that four of the nine haplotypes
were significant at the 5% level and two at the 1% level.

to better characterize the observed association, we performed conditional tests (table 1). three snps show independent effects. in a finding consistent with this analysis, no snp
passes the sole-variant test (i.e., all results are still highly significant). likewise, no single haplotype can fully explain the
omnibus association result (i.e., no single haplotype passes the
sole variant test).
finally, in an exploratory analysis, we examined association
among male subjects between rs4675690 and the four subscales
individually to attempt to clarify which aspects of anger experience and expression accounted for the observed effect. the most
significant association was observed for anger control-in (p ⬍

discussion
in this report, we identify strong evidence of association
between snps spanning  xxxg515xxx  and a summary measure of anger
expression among a cohort of men but not women with mdd.
we also introduce a conditional, regression-based method for
dissecting the genetic signal in terms of which variant might have
causal (or, at least, independent) effects. although rs4675690
shows the strongest statistical significance, it alone does not
account for all of the association between variation in  xxxg515xxx  and
the anger phenotype. the association of rs2253206, for example,
cannot be explained by its correlation with rs4675690. one
explanation is that there is a single causal variant in  xxxg515xxx  but
that it was not genotyped in this study: in this case, the multiple
association signals arise as a consequence of the ld patterns in
this gene. alternatively, these data are consistent with multiple
causal variants, which might be any of the six genotyped snps or
other untyped snps in ld with them (supplement 1).
because there are only four putative promoter snps and no
coding snps in  xxxg515xxx  according to the snpper informatics tool
(riva and kohane 2002), we used a tagging approach to ensure
adequate coverage of  xxxg515xxx  snps rather than prioritizing only
functional snps. whereas two of the tag snps lie in the  xxxg515xxx 
promoter region (as defined in dbsnp), two are 3’ to  xxxg515xxx ,
adjacent to a second gene (loc151194). although a less likely a
priori candidate, loc151194 thus cannot be excluded as mediating the observed association.
three convergent lines of evidence implicate  xxxg515xxx  in anger
expression. first, animal models of emotional reactivity, includ-

r.h. perlis et al.
ing aggression and anxiety (barrot et al. 2002, 2005; david et al.
2004; pandey 2003), which are known to correlate with anger as
well as reward/aversion pathways (barrot et al. 2005; carlezon et
al. 2005; dong et al. 2006; mcclung and nestler 2003; pliakas et
al. 2001), show changes in creb activity or expression. second,
region-specific alterations in creb activity have been observed
in animal models of antidepressant treatment (dowlatshahi et al.
1998; koch et al. 2002; yamada et al. 2003). notably, antidepressant drugs have been shown to exert effects on irritability and
anger that might overlap only partially with their effects on mood
(choi-kwon et al. 2006; davidson et al. 2002; yonkers et al.
1997). finally, in humans, changes in creb have been demonstrated in suicide victims, and suicide is known to be strongly
associated with hostility and anger expression (dwivedi et al.
2003; laifenfeld et al. 2005; odagaki et al. 2001; perlis et al. 2005;
young et al. 2004).
a primary limitation in this report is the small sample size and
inability to fully exclude admixture, and we emphasize the need
for replication and further study to examine whether the observed association is specific to depressed individuals. moreover,
because mean anger expression scores on the staxi are lower in
women (spielberger 1999) and female depressed patients express lower levels of hostility in general (fava et al. 1995), the
gender-specific effect we observe might simply indicate that the
staxi is less sensitive to typical modes of anger expression
among female subjects.
although preliminary, our findings suggest the utility of
examining non–dsm-iv-based quantitative traits in psychiatric
genetic studies (placidi et al. 2001). they further illustrate the
application of statistical methodologies that facilitate the detection and dissection of associations.
