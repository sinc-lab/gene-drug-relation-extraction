the challenge in developing hypnotic agents for the treatment of insomnia is to balance the sedative effect needed at bedtime
with the residual sedation on awakening. zaleplon is a novel pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic agent that acts as a selective
agonist to the brain omega1 receptor situated on the  xxxg830xxx  subunit of the gabaa receptor complex. zaleplon was proven
to be an effective hypnotic drug as it consistently and signi®cantly reduced latency to persistent sleep in insomniac patients
for doses of 10 mg and above in polysomnography studies. the pharmacodynamic pro®le of zaleplon on psychomotor performance, actual driving and cognitive function, including memory, was assessed in several randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies in healthy young subjects as well as insomniac patients by using various positive controls
(zolpidem, zopiclone, triazolam and ¯urazepam). the recommended hypnotic dose of zaleplon in young adults (10 mg)
produced minimal or no impairment of psychomotor and memory performance even when administered during the night
as little as 1 h before waking. no impairment of actual driving was observed when zaleplon 10 mg was administered either at
bedtime or in the middle of the night as little as 4 h before waking. zaleplon 20 mg, twice the recommended dose, generally
produced signi®cant impairment of performance and cognitive functions when these functions were measured at the time of
peak plasma concentration, i.e. 1 h after dose administration, and no impairment of driving abilities was observed 4 h after a
middle-of-the-night administration. in contrast, consistent detrimental residual effects on various aspects of psychomotor
and cognitive functions were observed with the therapeutic doses of the various commonly prescribed hypnotic agents used
as comparators, e.g. zolpidem 10 mg up to 5 h after dose administration, zopiclone 7.5 mg up to 10 h after, ¯urazepam 30 mg
up to 14 h after and triazolam 0.25 mg up to 6 h after. also, zolpidem 10 mg and zopiclone 7.5 mg were also shown to
signi®cantly impair driving ability the next morning when this was measured 4 h and up to 10 h after dose administration,
respectively. the present review shows that zaleplon 10 mg has little or no residual effect when administered in the middle of
the night, as late as 1 h before waking, and is devoid of impairment of driving abilities as assessed by actual driving 4 h after
dose administration. the lack of clinically signi®cant or minimally statistically signi®cant residual effects of zaleplon even
at its peak concentration may be explained by its unique pharmacokinetic (rapid elimination half-life) and pharmacodynamic (low af®nity, and speci®c binding pro®le to various subunits of the gabaa receptor) pro®les. these properties allow
zaleplon to be used for treatment of symptoms only when they occur, either at bedtime or later in the night, without incurring
signi®cant risk of developing next-day impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning. copyright # 2001 john

non-restful sleep (dement, 1982). it is de®ned as poor
sleep quality or an inadequate quantity of sleep that
adversely affects normal daily functioning (wagner
et al., 1998). insomnia or sleep disorder is a common
complaint that affects approximately 13% to 45% of
the adult population (bixler et al., 1979; karacan
et al., 1976; consensus development conference,
1984; mellinger et al., 1985; lugaresi et al.,
1987; ancoli-israel and roth, 1991; maczaj, 1993;

a. patat et al.

mendelson and jain, 1995; hatoum et al., 1998). it
appears that about 35% of the adult north american
population suffers from sleep disorders, about half
(19% of all adults) of whom de®ne this insomnia as
severe (mellinger et al., 1985). seventeen percent of
these patients feel that their insomnia has a serious
impact on their lives (freeman, 1996). the prevalence
of chronic insomnia in the us has been estimated at
between 9% and 15% (ford and kamerow, 1989;
costa e silva et al., 1996; ancoli-israel and roth,
1999). the prevalence of severe insomnia ranged
from 4% to 22% in a european multinational survey;
it was higher in women than in men, but did not
increase signi®cantly with age (chevalier et al.,
1999). however, other studies showed that insomnia
increases in prevalence and severity with age
(mellinger et al., 1985; foley et al., 1995). similar
studies indicate that about 16% to 30% of the population above 40 years of age complains of recurrent or
chronic sleep disorders (bixler et al., 1979; karacan
et al., 1976).
insomnia can be classi®ed as three types, based on
the duration of symptoms: transient, short-term or
chronic (freeman, 1996; kupfer and reynolds,
1997; wagner et al., 1998). transient insomnia is generally present for 2 to 3 days and is associated with
acute stress or disruption of circadian rhythms (e.g.
jet lag, shift work). short-term insomnia persists for
less than 3 weeks and is related to ongoing stress often
associated with work or family life (e.g. loss of a job,
illness). finally, long-term or chronic insomnia lasts
for more than 3 weeks and is associated with one or
more causative factors such as underlying psychiatric
or medical disorders, chronic drug or alcohol abuse,
primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnea, restless
leg syndrome), poor sleep hygiene or psychobiological insomnia. symptoms of chronic insomnia include
frequent or chronic dif®culty in falling asleep at night,
prolonged and frequent nocturnal awakenings, early
morning awakenings, insuf®cient duration of sleep
and poor quality of sleep.
insomnia is more commonly found in women,
older individuals and patients with chronic medical
or psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety (aldrich, 1989; mendelson and jain, 1995; kupfer
and reynolds, 1997; wagner et al., 1998). insomnia
has a negative impact, independent of any coexisting
disorder, on daily life and consequently on quality of
life (marquis, 1996). therefore insomnia may result
in daytime functional impairment and symptoms,
such as fatigue, irritability, anxiety, decreased ability
to concentrate and inability to perform complex tasks
(idzikowski, 1996; hauri, 1997; weissman et al., 1997;
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

roth and ancoli-israel, 1999). furthermore, epidemiological studies indicate that insomnia is associated with absenteeism and decreased productivity,
increased risk of other important health problems,
including psychiatric or general comorbidities such
as depression, and an increased probability of fatigue-related accidents (hohagen et al., 1993; stoller,
1994; chilcott and shapiro, 1996; mendelson and
jain, 1995; breslau et al., 1996; kupfer and reynolds,
1997; hatoum et al., 1998; roth and ancoli-israel,
1999; roth, 2000).
for many patients diagnosed with insomnia,
complaints involve not only a problem falling asleep
but, more often, dif®culty in maintaining sleep
throughout the regular night-time sleep period. in a
us study of more than 1000 adults aged 18 years
and older, the predominant sleep complaint was
middle-of-the-night awakenings (43%), followed by
next-day fatigue (34%) and dif®culty returning to
sleep after awakening (26%) (national sleep foundation and the gallup organization, 1995). these data
are supported by a similar study, in which chronic
insomniacs named waking up drowsy (72%), waking
up in the middle of the night (67%) and dif®culty
returning to sleep after awakening (57%) as the three
most common sleep complaints, followed by inability
to fall asleep (56%) (ancoli-israel and roth, 1999).
these ®ndings are of particular importance as insomnia is usually considered by both patients and physicians as a problem only of getting to sleep rather than
staying asleep, and medications are prescribed for
bedtime only.
currently benzodiazepines, including triazolam,
temazepam, lormetazepam, ¯unitrazepam and
¯urazepam, are among the most frequently prescribed
medications for the treatment of insomnia (nowell
et al., 1997). benzodiazepine hypnotics are effective
in the treatment of sleep disorders in that they
decrease sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings and
wake time after sleep onset; they increase total sleep
time; and they improve subject rating of the quality of
sleep. while benzodiazepines are safer than the
previous generation of hypnotics, barbiturates or
chloral hydrate (davis, 1985; harvey, 1985; hollister
et al., 1993; dingemanse, 1995; gillin and byerley,
1990; maczaj, 1993; mendelson and jain, 1995;
vgontzas et al., 1995; nowell et al., 1997), they do
have some of the same problematic side effects,
including memory and psychomotor performance
impairment and next-day hangover effects. benzodiazepine hypnotics also produce additive or synergistic
effects with other central nervous system (cns)
depressant drugs (especially alcohol) and have a

potential for the development of tolerance to their
hypnotic effects, as well as for abuse, and for
withdrawal symptoms and rebound insomnia after
abrupt discontinuation (johnson and chernik, 1983;
kales et al., 1983; consensus development conference, 1984; hindmarch, 1984; mendelson, 1987;
woods et al., 1987, 1992).
of particular relevance to the present review are the
cognitive and psychomotor impairments and
increased residual drowsiness and consequent risks
for motor vehicle and other accidents related to
impaired functioning produced by benzodiazepines
(wittenborn, 1979; ray et al., 1987, 1992; koelega,
1989; curran, 1986, 1991; ghoneim and mewaldt,
1990; patat et al., 1991; barbee, 1993; hemmelgarn
et al., 1997; van laar and volkerts, 1998; barbone
et al., 1998; neutel, 1998). this class of compounds
produces anterograde amnesia, characterized by a
de®cit in acquisition and ®xation of new information,
in a dose-dependent manner. thus, even if new
information may be temporarily recorded, as
indicated by no decrement in immediate free recall
or working memory at some dose levels, this information is not stored because of defective encoding and
consolidation as demonstrated by a marked impairment in delayed free recall measures. in addition,
these cognitive and psychomotor impairments may
still be present to a certain degree the  xxxd2476xxx 
drug ingestion. these longer-lasting side effects are
collectively referred to as the `morning hangover' or
`next-day hangover' effects of benzodiazepines.
these residual effects, which are characterized by
daytime sleepiness and impairment of psychomotor
and cognitive functions, are among the main
problems associated with hypnotics currently in use.
all these effects are highly dependent on dose and
the half-life of the hypnotic used.
epidemiological studies have also shown that the
use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics or hypnotics, as
well as of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zopiclone, is associated with an increased risk of injurious
car accidents (ray et al., 1992; hemmelgarn et al.,
1997; barbone et al., 1998; neutel, 1998; van laar
and volkerts, 1998). new users increased their risk
of injurious traf®c accidents within the ®rst 4 weeks
of a benzodiazepine prescription at an odds ratio of
3.1 (95% con®dence interval 1.5±6.2). subjects
younger than 60 years old had a risk with an odds
ratio of 3.2, while older people had a risk with an odds
ratio of 2.8. amongst the benzodiazepines, ¯urazepam and triazolam showed the largest increase in risk,
with odds ratios of 5.1 and 3.2, respectively (neutel,
1998). ray et al. (1992) reviewed records over a

5-year follow-up period (1984±1988) of 16 262
elderly (>65 years) medicaid patients who resided
in tennessee. within this population, benzodiazepine
anxiolytic users were involved in traf®c accidents at a
rate 1.5 times higher than that of subjects not treated
with psychoactive drugs. moreover, the users' accident rate increased as a function of the prescribed
dose, i.e. it increased from about that for the control
level at the lowest therapeutic dose to a rate 2.4 times
above the control level at the highest dose.
these data strongly imply a causal relationship
between benzodiazepine use and traf®c accidents.
actual driving studies have shown that benzodiazepine hypnotics, including ¯urazepam, ¯unitrazepam,
loprazolam and zopiclone, have strong residual
effects on driving performance that persist throughout
the day after ingestion (volkerts and o'hanlon, 1988;
volkerts et al., 1992; brookhuis et al., 1990, 1998;
van laar and volkerts, 1998). in these studies, some
subjects even had to stop driving prematurely because
they were unable to control the vehicle's position on
the road. such safety issues should be investigated
during the development of any drug that can disturb
performance and cognitive function, and these
investigations should be conducted by using appropriate, reliable and sensitive methods (including actual
driving) that can be easily related to everyday
activities in standardized placebo-controlled studies
in comparison with a positive control (hindmarch,
1980; brookhuis, 1998; patat, 1998, 2000). thus, a
need remains for new hypnotics that are effective
but that lack the side effects characteristic of currently
available benzodiazepines.
zaleplon (sonata1, n-(3-(3-cyanopyrazolo(1,5-a)
pyrimidin-7-yl)phenyl)-n-ethylacetamide) is a novel
non-benzodiazepine hypnotic with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates and
other drugs with known hypnotic properties. zaleplon
belongs to a new class of drugs called pyrazolopyrimidines. binding studies have shown that zaleplon
has a highly selective and low af®nity for gabaa
receptors containing the 1 subunit (also called benzodiazepine type 1 ( xxxd367xxx ) or omega 1 (t1) receptors)
(sanger et al., 1994, 1996; daèmgen and luèddens,
1999). zaleplon's preclinical pro®le demonstrated
that it possesses agonist properties and is a rapid-acting hypnotic compound that is devoid of the many
untoward side effects typically associated with other
hypnotic agents, e.g. next-day hangover, residual
effects, potentiation with alcohol, tolerance development and dependence (sanger et al., 1994, 1996; beer
et al., 1997; dooley and plosker, 2000). many of the
clinical pharmacology studies reviewed in this paper

a. patat et al.

have con®rmed these differences between zaleplon
and other hypnotics. in particular, the results of these
studies showed less marked impairment at peak concentrations of zaleplon than at equipotent doses of
other hypnotics and a lack of next-day residual effects
even when zaleplon was administered 2 h before waking. zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in
humans: its time to peak concentration (tmax) is
approximately 1 h and its terminal elimination halflife (t1/2b) is also approximately 1 h (beer et al.,
1994; greenblatt et al., 1998; rosen et al., 1999;
dooley and plosker, 2000). zaleplon is extensively
metabolized to several metabolites that are all pharmacologically inactive (vanover et al., 1994). it is
more rapidly eliminated than any other benzodiazepine or non-benzodiazepine hypnotic currently
used in clinical practice (greenblatt et al., 1983;
garzone and kroboth, 1989; salva and costa,
1995). these pharmacokinetic data indicate that
zaleplon has a rapid onset of action and a rapid
elimination half-life.
zaleplon 10 mg was found to be effective in
reducing latency to sleep onset in insomniac patients,
when assessed either objectively by polysomnography or by subjective evaluation (patient questionnaire) after a bedtime administration (dietrich and
farr, 1995; walsh et al., 1998, 2000a, 2000b,
2000c; ancoli-israel et al., 1999; elie et al., 1999;
cluydts, 2000; drake et al., 2000; hedner et al.,
2000; fry et al., 2000; dooley and plosker, 2000),
without showing pharmacological tolerance during
therapy or producing rebound insomnia or withdrawal
symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (scharf,
1999; hedner and mangano, 1999; walsh et al.,
2000b; fry et al., 2000; cluydts, 2000; dooley and
plosker, 2000). zaleplon 10 mg is equipotent to zolpidem 10 mg or triazolam 0.25 mg in terms of sleep
induction (fry et al., 2000; walsh et al., 2000a,
2000b; drake et al., 2000). like most hypnotics,
zaleplon can be used as a sleep promoter in patients
having dif®culty falling asleep at bedtime at the
beginning of the night. however, zaleplon's very
short half-life, rapid onset of action and unique
pharmacodynamic pro®le may also allow patients to
take the drug later in the night and yet be free of residual effects the next morning (vermeeren et al., 1998;
danjou et al., 1999b; walsh et al., 2000a; hindmarch
et al., 2001; stone et al., 2000; volkerts et al., 2000;
zammit, 2000; corser et al., 2000). this would be
advantageous for patients having sleep maintenance
problems or dif®culty falling sleep after being
awakened during the night. zaleplon 10 mg was
also shown to be effective when administered in
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

the middle of the night to patients with sleep
maintenance insomnia (corser et al., 2000; zammit
et al., 2000).
the objective of this paper is to review the doubleblind, placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic studies
assessing the effects of zaleplon on a variety of objective psychomotor performance and cognitive functions, including memory and driving abilities, in
healthy subjects or insomniac patients, when administered either in the morning, in the evening at bedtime
or in the middle of the night.
methods
subjects
of the 16 studies, 13 were of 371 healthy women and
men aged 18±45 and three were of 92 patients with
sleep maintenance insomnia aged 18±65. all subjects
were declared normal after the investigator reviewed
their medical histories and the results of their physical
examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram and routine
laboratory tests (complete blood count, blood chemistry, urinalysis and urine drug screen for drugs of
abuse). women were to have been using a medically
acceptable method of birth control and had to have a
negative serum pregnancy test before dose administration. each study protocol was approved by a quali®ed independent ethics committee, and written
informed consent was obtained from each participant
before inclusion in the study. any other medication,
including drugs known as potential hepatic enzyme
inducers or inhibitors, psychotropic drugs and antihistamine drugs, were prohibited from 1 mo before dose
administration to the end of the clinical trial.

study design and medication
all 16 studies were randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, single- or multiple-dose trials.
fifteen studies were crossover trials and the remaining one was a parallel-groups trial. all 16 studies
assessed the recommended dose of zaleplon
(10 mg); nine studies also assessed a dose that was
twice the recommended dose (20 mg). reference
compounds used as positive controls included the
recommended dose of zolpidem (10 mg; eight studies), zopiclone (7.5 mg; four studies), ¯urazepam
(30 mg; two studies), triazolam (0.25 mg; two studies)
and lorazepam (2 mg; one study) and twice the recommended dose of zolpidem (i.e. 20 mg; ®ve studies).
one study investigated the interaction of zaleplon
hum psychopharmacol clin exp 2001; 16: 369±392.

pharmacodynamic pro®le of zaleplon
with ethanol (0.75 g/kg), and triazolam 0.25 mg was
used as a positive control. four studies assessed a
morning single-dose administration (table 1) and 12
assessed an evening (®ve studies) or middle-of-thenight administration (eight studies) (table 2). it
should be noted that zopiclone and zolpidem were
used as positive controls in the middle-of-the-night
studies±this corresponds to an off-label use and
should be taken into account in the interpretation of
these data.
participants abstained from smoking, drinking
xanthine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, cola or
soft drinks), grapefruit-containing products and alcohol during each treatment period and the preceding
24 h. no concomitant treatment was permitted during
the study except contraceptive pills. all participants
were trained individually before entering the study
to familiarize them with the experimental tasks so
they would to reach a stable performance and to minimize any learning effects (parkin et al., 1997).
assessment criteria
cognitive processes and functions were assessed
objectively by using a wide range of standardized,
sensitive, validated and reliable psychomotor tests
(hindmarch, 1980; patat, 1998, 2000). the most commonly used tests are described below and summarized
in table 3. this is a general description as small
changes may occur from one author to another. a full
description is provided in the publication of each
study.

critical ¯icker fusion (cff). this test is used as a
means of measuring a subject's ability to distinguish
discrete sensory data and is taken as an index of
overall cns activity (smith and misiak, 1976;
hindmarch and clyde, 1980; hindmarch, 1982;
levander, 1982; parkin et al., 1997). the subjects
are required to discriminate ¯icker from fusion in a
set of four light-emitting red diodes in foveal ®xation
at a distance of 1 m. individual thresholds are
determined by method of limits. the light source is
turned on intermittently at increasing then decreasing
frequencies. during the increasing frequency phase,
the participant is asked to press a key when the
¯ickering is perceived to be replaced by a continuous
light signal. this indicates the fusion frequency.
then, during the decreasing frequency phase, the
participant indicates the frequency at which a
¯ickering light is again perceived, i.e. the ¯icker
frequency. these two frequencies (measured in hz)
are relatively stable in a given individual and reliably
re¯ect alertness and cortical arousal. the score is the
mean of three increasing and three decreasing
thresholds.
simple reaction time (srt). this test evaluates the
speed with which an individual is able to respond to
a visual or an auditory stimulus by pressing a key.
the score is the mean reaction time for 21 to 50
stimuli.

choice reaction time (crt). this test evaluates the
speed with which an individual is able to respond to a
visual stimulus by using his or her dominant hand and
is used as a measure of sensorimotor performance
(parkin et al., 1997; hindmarch and clyde, 1980).
subjects are required to extinguish, as quickly as possible, 50 stimuli appearing in a random order on one
of six light-emitting diodes located 30 cm from the
central switch of a response panel, by touching the
appropriate response button. the score is the mean
reaction time for the 50 presented stimuli. the
recognition (rrt) and motor (mrt) components
are also recorded.
critical tracking task (ctt). this test measures the
ability to control an unstable error signal in a ®rstorder compensatory tracking task (jex et al., 1966).
subjects are instructed to keep an unstable moving
bar in the middle of a horizontal plane. with the aid of
a computer mouse they can counteract or reverse the
movements of the unstable bar. if the bar hits the edge
of the plane, the subject has to start again. the root
mean square (rms) of the tracking error or the
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

frequency of cursor deviations at which the subject
loses control (rad/sec) is the outcome measure.
divided attention task (dat). this test measures the
ability to divide attention between two tasks performed simultaneously (moskowitz, 1973). with the
dominant hand, the subject performs the ctt, as
described above, but at a constant level of dif®culty
set at 50% of his or her maximal capacity. the mean
tracking error is the outcome. concurrently, a
sternberg memory scanning test (®xed version) is
performed with the other hand. before the start, a
memory set of four digits is shown. thereafter, subsequent digits are presented on the computer screen. by
button-press, the subject has to indicate whether a
digit has been shown beforehand (left button) or not
(right button). the mean reaction time is the parameter of interest.
digit symbol substitution test (dsst). this is a
paper-and-pencil test with a test-retest version. it is part
of the subtest of the wechsler adult intelligence scale
and assesses information processing, concentration

and psychomotor performance (wechsler, 1944). participants are requested to match digits with symbols
by using a code. the score is the number of correct
answers in 90, 120 or 180 s.
pharmacodynamics: actual driving
the driving test was standardized in 1984 and has
been applied to assess drugs in more than 50 separate
studies (o'hanlon and ramaekers, 1995; o'hanlon
et al., 1995). the major advantage of this test is
its realistic nature, which is dif®cult to simulate in
the laboratory. the subject drives an instrumented
car over a 100 km (61 miles) primary highway
circuit. a licensed driving instructor, who has
access to dual controls, accompanies the subject.
the subject's task is to maintain a constant speed of
95 km/h (58 miles/h) and a steady lateral position
between the delineated boundaries of the right
(slower) traf®c lane. the vehicle's speed and lateral
position relative to the left lane delineation are continuously recorded by systems described previously
(o'hanlon et al., 1982). these signals are edited
off-line to remove data recorded during overtaking
manoeuvres or disturbances caused by roadway or
traf®c situations. the remainder is then reduced to
yield the standard deviation of lateral position (sdlp,
in cm) for each successive 5 km segment and, as the
square root of pooled variance over all segments, for
the test as a whole. sdlp is an index of road-tracking
error or of the ability of the driver to control weaving
of the car. it is a reliable characteristic of individual
driving performance (test-retest reliability coef®cient
for unmedicated young and middle-aged drivers:
r 0.85) and has proven to be a very sensitive
indicator of drug-induced driver impairment. based
on the relationship between breath alcohol concentration (bac) and the ability to control weaving, an
increase in sdlp in the range of 2.5±4.0 cm would
result in increased incidence of accident proneness
(brookhuis, 1998).
pharmacodynamics: memory
sternberg memory scanning task. high-speed
scanning and retrieval from short-term memory are
assessed by using a reaction time technique
(sternberg, 1969). subjects are required to judge
whether the probe digit is contained within a short
sequence of one, three, or ®ve digits (the stimulus
set is presented sequentially for 500 ms per digit)
by using a two-button yes-no choice response
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

box. twenty trials are performed for each series of
digits, each comprising 50% correct and 50% incorrect digits. the test digit (probe) has to be correctly
recognized as present in the positive mode and as
absent in the negative mode. the scores are the slope
for each series of digits in the positive and negative
mode.
word list. short- and long-term memories are
assessed by using a list of 15±20 words. after presentation of these words for 2 min, the subject is asked to
freely recall as many words as possible in any order
(immediate free recall, ifr). delayed free recall
(dfr) is then measured 30 min after the ifr (lucki
et al., 1986). in two experiments (vermeeren et al.,
1998, 2000), a learning memory test was used, with
four presentations of the word list.
pharmacodynamics: electrophysiology
multiple sleep latency task (mslt). the multiple
sleep latency test is a polysomnographic tool for
assessment of daytime sleepiness related to hypnotic
therapy (carskadon et al., 1986). it is performed several times throughout the day to measure the length of
time required for an individual to initiate sleep in an
environment conducive to such activity. each sleep
latency testing (slt) was terminated after three consecutive epochs of stage 1, after a single epoch of any
other sleep stage, or after 20 min if no sleep occurred.
sleep latency was scored as the time from slt start to
the ®rst epoch of sleep. if no sleep occurred, a value of
20 min was used as the latency.
daytime electroencephalography (eeg). the eeg
is recorded using a six-electrode monopolar montage.
the eeg is quanti®ed in 4 s epochs for as long as
necessary to ensure at least 2 min of artifact-free
recording. data are digitized, and afterwards the
power spectrum is calculated to determine activity
over the 4.0±31.75 hz spectrum and in the `beta'
(13.0±31.75 hz) band (greenblatt et al., 1998).
statistical analysis
the statistical analysis for most studies consisted of
analysis of variance (anova) for a crossover design
with factors for subject, treatment, time (if appropriate), period, carry-over (for some studies) and
corresponding interactions. all comparisons were
two-sided and were conducted at the 5% level of
signi®cance, and bonferroni or other adjustment

results
polysomnography
the hypnotic ef®cacy of zaleplon was demonstrated
in several studies by using polysomnography (psg).
sleep latency (time to sleep onset), or latency to
persistent sleep, measured by psg, was signi®cantly
and consistently reduced with zaleplon 10 mg/night
administered at bedtime, compared with placebo, in
non-elderly patients with insomnia (dietrich and farr,
1995; walsh et al., 1998, 2000b; cluydts, 2000;
drake et al., 2000). zaleplon 20 mg/night signi®cantly improved sleep duration in addition to
reducing sleep latency. when administered in the
middle of the night in patients with sleep maintenance
insomnia, zaleplon 10 mg was also shown to
consistently and signi®cantly reduce latency to
persistent sleep as well as to signi®cantly increase
sleep time (corser et al., 2000; zammit, 2000). the
development of tolerance to the hypnotic effect as
measured by sleep latency was not observed on
psg for up to 5 weeks (walsh et al., 2000b).
similar results were observed in studies evaluating
sleep latency by questionnaire (elie et al., 1999;
ancoli-israel et al., 1999; hedner et al., 2000; fry
et al., 2000). finally, zaleplon was also effective in
reducing latency to persistent sleep in a model of
sleep maintenance insomnia, characterized by noiseinduced middle-of-the-night insomnia, by using a
sound stimulus able to prolong sleep latency (80 db
[a] 1 khz pure tone pulse with an inter-tone interval
of 1 s and a duration of 50 ms) (stone et al., 2000), as
well as in a phase-advance model of transient
insomnia (dietrich et al., 1998).
zaleplon 5 mg and 10 mg preserved sleep architecture according to the psg results obtained after visual
analysis of sleep in healthy subjects (dietrich et al.,
1998; stone et al., 2000) or in patients with insomnia
(dietrich and farr, 1995; walsh et al., 1998, 2000b;
scharf, 2000; cluydts, 2000). indeed, the time spent
in the various sleep stages was not signi®cantly
altered with zaleplon 10 mg administered for up to 5
weeks. in contrast, a higher dosage of zaleplon
(20 mg/night) signi®cantly reduced stage 1, rem
and stage 3/4 sleep, and increased time spent in stage
2 (cluydts, 2000). zolpidem 10 mg/night had effects
on sleep architecture that were similar to those of
zaleplon 20 mg in insomniac patients, i.e. shortening

of sleep latency and increase of total sleep time
(cluydts, 2000). triazolam 0.25 mg signi®cantly
decreased sleep latency and the number of awakenings while prolonging the duration of sleep. however,
in contrast to zaleplon, triazolam disrupted sleep
architecture, in particular signi®cantly decreasing
rem and stage 3/4 sleep (pakes et al., 1981; drake
et al., 2000). however, no data are yet available from
all night eeg spectral power to con®rm whether this
lack of change in sleep macro-structure still persisted
in sleep micro-structure.
effects on psychomotor performance and attention
zaleplon 10 mg was consistently devoid of any
signi®cant impairment in cns arousal (cff), speed
of reaction (crt), selective attention and coordination (tracking), divided attention (dat tracking and
reaction time), and body sway when administered
either in the morning, in the evening, or in the middle
of the night as little as 1 h before awakening (table 4).
zaleplon 10 mg showed minimal but statistically signi®cant impairing effects on vigilance assessed by a
continuous performance task (auditory vigilance) in
one study (roehrs et al., 2001) and on dsst in three
studies (when evaluated 1±1.5 h after dose administration after a morning administration (roehrs et al.,
2001) or a middle-of-the-night administration in
healthy subjects (hindmarch et al., 2001) and when
evaluated 4 h after a middle-of-the-night administration in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia
(zammit, 2000)). however, no statistically signi®cant
detrimental effects, compared with placebo, were
detected in dsst responses when assessed at
approximately 1 h after dose administration in three
other studies (troy et al., 2000; greenblatt et al.,
1998; drover et al., 1998, 2000) and at 2±4 h after
dose administration in all other studies with dsst,
including another study in patients with maintenance
insomnia using a similar design (zammit, 2000;
corser et al., 2000).
zaleplon 20 mg produced signi®cant impairment at
peak concentration, i.e. approximately 1 h after dose
administration, in cff, crt, dsst, digit cancellation, tracking, divided attention, and vigilance (rapid
visual information processing task (rvip))
(hindmarch et al., 2001; troy et al., 2000; allen
et al., 1993) (table 4). however, no impairing
effect was observed on body sway (vermeeren et al.,
1998), and no decrement was noticed in dsst
scores in two studies even 1 h after a daytime administration (greenblatt et al., 1998; drover et al., 1998,
2000).

( 0.9 min and  1.9 min versus placebo 4 h after the

contrast, ¯urazepam 30 mg produced a signi®cant
impairment in mslt, both  xxxd1891xxx  h and 14 h after an
evening administration (decrease of 6 min versus

study, and 6.2, 4.3, 2.8 min 4, 5 and 7 h after

the effects of zaleplon 10 mg and 20 mg on daytime eeg were assessed in two studies (greenblatt
et al., 1998; drover et al., 1998, 2000). both studies
focused on the eeg beta activity, which is consistently increased with benzodiazepine agonists. zaleplon 10 mg and 20 mg as well as zolpidem 10 mg
and 20 mg signi®cantly increased relative beta eeg
activity during the 4 h after administration. this effect
was more pronounced for zolpidem. unfortunately no

zaleplon 10 mg and 20 mg administered either in the
evening or in the middle of the night did not signi®cantly impair driving performance even when measured 4 h after dose administration (vermeeren et al.,
1998, 2000; volkerts et al., 2000) (table 5). in one
study, the sdlp estimates of difference from placebo
were 0.3 cm and 0.2 cm after zaleplon 10 mg
administered in the evening (10 h before) and in the
middle of the night (5 h before), respectively, and
0.7 cm and  0.2 cm after zaleplon 20 mg administered in the evening and in the middle of the night,

by  3.8 cm and  10.6 cm with zolpidem 10 mg
and 20 mg, respectively; volkerts et al., 2000).

assessment was done on the slow delta and theta eeg
activity or on the alpha eeg energy. such an analysis
would have been useful in determining the duration of
action of the drug on the cns because hypnotics are
expected to decrease relative alpha activity and
increase relative slow delta and theta waves, as previously demonstrated with zolpidem (patat et al.,
1994).
cognitive functions and memory
zaleplon 10 mg did not signi®cantly impair ifr or
various short-term and working memory tasks such
as digit span, paired words, sternberg memory scanning and visuospatial memory (table 7). zaleplon
10 mg did not signi®cantly decrease dfr, except in
two studies (of 10), at 1.25 h and 4 h after an evening
administration (vermeeren et al., 1998; troy et al.,

2000). in these studies, the dfr was 1±1.5 words less
after zaleplon 10 mg than after placebo. to correct for
a failure in initial acquisition, delayed recall was also
scored as a percentage of ifr (relative recall). there
was no signi®cant difference from placebo in relative
recall after administration of zaleplon 10 mg in these
two studies as well as in the others. zaleplon 20 mg
signi®cantly impaired short-term memory (ifr) in
three of 10 studies at 1±3 h after dose administration
and long-term memory (dfr) at 1 h after in three of
10 studies and at 4 h after in two studies (vermeeren
et al., 1998; stone et al., 2000).
in contrast, zolpidem, triazolam and zopiclone
produced consistent and signi®cant impairment of
memory of greater magnitude and longer duration
than that produced by zaleplon 20 mg. zolpidem

discussion
as a novel non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, zaleplon
possesses many of the characteristics for the ideal

treatment of insomnia. indeed, the ideal hypnotic
should rapidly induce sleep, should preserve or
restore a physiological sleep architecture (in
particular it should not decrease stages 3 and 4 and
rem sleep), and should not produce respiratory
depression. it should also be free of residual effects
on psychomotor performance and memory, even if
the patient is for some reason awakened prematurely.
in addition, interaction with concomitant medication,
especially other cns depressant drugs, and
synergism with alcohol have to be absent. rebound
insomnia, a common feature of short-acting
compounds that often leads to hypnotic abuse, must
not occur. tolerance to the hypnotic action, which
develops with all available benzodiazepine hypnotics,
must be absent. this would avoid the gradual increase
hum psychopharmacol clin exp 2001; 16: 369±392.

pharmacodynamic pro®le of zaleplon
in dose and limit physical dependence and abuse
liability.
onset of effects and their duration are mainly determined by the pharmacokinetic pro®le, particularly the
rate of absorption and distribution of the active drug,
its metabolic rate (including the potential formation
of active metabolites) and the terminal elimination
half-life of both the active compound and any active
metabolites. the ideal hypnotic should, therefore,
possess a rapid absorption and rapid distribution to
the brain to reach hypnotic concentration within a
short time, without large inter-individual and intraindividual variations, should have a short half-life
and should be devoid of active metabolites. these features would allow a rapid onset of sleep and would
prevent residual effects as much as possible.
residual effects of hypnotics are characterized by
persistent sedative effects and impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functions that may interfere with
everyday living. in the evaluation of any sleep medication, the therapeutic endpoint of restful sleep is of
little value if psychomotor or memory function is
impaired when the patient needs to be awake and
alert. all benzodiazepines may cause this impairment
during the period of medication activity. these effects
are highly dependent on dose and on the half-life of
the hypnotic used. although sedation is valuable during the desired sleep period, it should resolve by the
desired wake time. the period of pharmacological
action of any agent can be reasonably well determined
by multiplying the half-life of that agent by 2.5 to 3.
indeed, residual sedative effects have mainly been
associated with hypnotics with a long half-life, such
as barbiturates, ¯urazepam, nitrazepam and ¯unitrazepam (bond and lader, 1975; ogura et al., 1980;
hindmarch and clyde, 1980; nicholson and stone,
1980; lader et al., 1982; mattmann et al., 1982;
gorenstein and gentil, 1983; hindmarch, 1984;
bensimon et al., 1990; vermeeren et al., 1995; bocca
et al., 1999). these residual effects are usually studied
after bedtime administration of the hypnotic, i.e.
8±10 h before awakening. impairment of driving abilities has even been demonstrated 10±16 h after administration of ¯unitrazepam 2 mg, ¯urazepam 15 mg and
30 mg and loprazolam 2 mg by using actual driving
tests (volkerts and o'hanlon, 1988; brookhuis et al.,
1990; volkerts et al., 1992; brookhuis, 1998; van
laar and volkerts, 1998). the pharmacokinetic pro®le does not provide the only evidence for such
effects; epidemiological studies have shown that the
largest increases in the risk of a car accident occurred
with ¯urazepam, a long half-life benzodiazepine, and
triazolam, a short half-life benzodiazepine (neutel,
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

1998). therefore, hypnotics with a shorter half-life
may also possess such residual effects even 10 h after
dose administration, depending on the pharmacodynamic pro®le.
zopiclone, a cyclopyrolone derivative chemically
unrelated to the benzodiazepines, appears to bind to
the same recognition site as the benzodiazepines,
enhancing the function of the gabaa receptor.
however, differences in receptor function seen after
binding suggest that zopiclone and benzodiazepines
may interact with separate binding domains or produce different conformational changes in the gabaa
receptor complex (noble et al., 1998). zopiclone has
a half-life ranging from 3.5 to 6 h (goa and heel,
1986; wadworth and mctavish, 1993; noble et al.,
1998). residual effects on saccadic eye movements,
actual driving and performance tasks such as dsst
and memory (delayed free recall) (lader and denney,
1983; fossen et al., 1983; grif®ths et al., 1986;
volkerts and o'hanlon, 1988; o'hanlon, 1995;
brookhuis, 1998; bocca et al., 1999; vermeeren
et al., 1998, 2000) have been observed 9±10 h after
an evening administration of the recommended hypnotic dose, 7.5 mg. the same dose of zopiclone administered in the middle of the night, i.e. 4±5 h before
awakening, produced statistically signi®cant deleterious residual effects on actual driving, psychomotor
functions (body sway, reaction time of a logical reasoning task) and cognitive functions (immediate and
delayed free recall of a word list, spatial working
memory) the next morning (vermeeren et al., 1998).
results from recent epidemiological studies have
shown that the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics, as
well as zopiclone, is associated with increased risk
of injurious car accidents (barbone et al., 1998;
neutel, 1998). barbone et al. collected data from
19 386 drivers in the united kingdom who were
involved in a ®rst road-traf®c accident, of whom
1731 were users of a psychoactive prescription drug.
analysis showed that the odds of having a road-traf®c
accident after use of zopiclone were four times greater
than when not using a psychoactive drug. this result
is consistent with the results of actual driving studies,
which consistently demonstrated an increase in sdlp
greater than 2.5 cm 10 h after zopiclone intake
(volkerts and o'hanlon, 1988; o'hanlon, 1995;
brookhuis, 1998; vermeeren et al., 1998, 2000).
due to the consistent residual impairment produced
by zopiclone 7.5 mg, nicholson (1998) recommends
avoiding prescribing this hypnotic to patients whose
activity the next morning involves skilled work and
for whom impairment of performance such as driving
could be a danger to themselves or others.

triazolam is the benzodiazepine hypnotic with
the shortest half-life (1±4 h) (pakes et al., 1981;
jochemsen et al., 1983). despite this very short
half-life, triazolam 0.25 mg and particularly 0.5 mg
(a dose used 10±20 years ago but not recommended
nowadays) was shown to produce marked residual
effects on various objective performance and cognitive functions (hindmarch and clyde, 1980; roth
et al., 1981; spinweber and johnson, 1982; borbely
et al., 1983; gorenstein and gentil, 1983; patat et al.,
1986). some cns-related adverse effects, including
severe anterograde amnesia and behavioural changes,
have been suggested to occur with a greater frequency
with triazolam than with other benzodiazepines,
especially at doses exceeding 0.25 mg or in geriatric
patients (american hospital formulary service,
2000). in addition, epidemiological studies showed a
greater car accident risk after intake of triazolam, indicating that the pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam
in the brain may last longer than expected based on
its pharmacokinetic half-life.
zolpidem, another non-benzodiazepine derivative,
is an imidazopyridine with a very short half-life.
zolpidem binds with a high selectivity to the  xxxd367xxx 
receptor (arbilla et al., 1985, 1986; dennis et al.,
1988; benavides et al., 1988, 1996; sanger et al.,
1994; besnard et al., 1996; sanger and depoortere,
1998; depoortere et al., 1998; holm and goa,
2000). biochemical and electrophysiological studies
indicated that zolpidem functions as a selective  xxxd367xxx 
agonist with a high intrinsic af®nity (langer et al.,
1988). therefore, both zaleplon and zolpidem facilitate gaba transmission by selectively binding to the
 xxxd367xxx  site on the gabaa receptor complex. zolpidem
is also a rapid- and short-acting hypnotic. it is rapidly
absorbed after oral administration with a tmax of
1±2 h and an elimination half-life in the range of
1.5±4 h (langtry and ben®eld, 1990; salva and costa,
1995; holm and goa, 2000). it has no active metabolite. the currently recommended dose of zolpidem for
short-term relief of insomnia in adults is 10 mg.
zolpidem is considered to be essentially free of
residual impairing effects when taken even late in
the evening (morselli et al., 1988; langtry and
ben®eld, 1990; lader and hindmarch, 1996; holm
and goa, 2000), and it has been used as a stringent
and fair comparator with zaleplon in several studies.
in a number of studies the recommended dose (10 mg)
or twice the recommended dose (20 mg) of zolpidem
was shown to be devoid of any detrimental residual
effects on various psychomotor performance tests
(cff, crt, dsst, tracking) and memory tests
(nicholson and pascoe, 1986; bensimon et al.,
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

1990; fairweather et al., 1992; roehrs et al., 1994;
quera-salva et al., 1994; bocca et al., 1999), actual
driving (vermeeren et al., 1995) and electrophysiological measures (saccadic eye movement, mslt)
(richens et al., 1993; quera-salva et al., 1994; bocca
et al., 1999), when evaluated 8 h or more after a bedtime administration in young and elderly subjects.
these results are consistent with the short elimination
half-life of zolpidem and the lack of an active metabolite (langtry and ben®eld, 1990; salva and costa,
1995; holm and goa, 2000). they are also consistent
with the results of other pharmacodynamic studies
assessing eeg (delta, alpha or beta waves) (patat
et al., 1994; greenblatt et al., 1996, 1998) and various
psychomotor and cognitive tests (berlin et al.,
1993; balkin et al., 1992; wesensten et al., 1995;
wilkinson, 1995; greenblatt et al., 1996, 1998; rush
and grif®ths, 1996; rush et al., 1998; rush, 1998;
drover et al., 1998; mintzer and grif®ths, 1999),
indicating a duration of cns effects of zolpidem of
about 3±4 h in healthy young subjects after a daytime
administration of a 10±20 mg dose. however, when
the time course of effect was studied during the night
after an evening administration, zolpidem was shown
to produce a statistically signi®cant detrimental effect
on alertness, as measured by cff, up to 7 h after dose
administration, on body sway up to 10 h after the
dose, and on memory (working memory and dfr
of words) up to 4 h after (allain et al., 1995).
the pattern of memory-impairing effects produced
by zolpidem appears to be qualitatively similar to the
pattern produced by classic benzodiazepines. zolpidem impaired explicit memory (dfr) for material
presented after drug administration (anterograde
amnesia) but spared explicit memory for material
presented before drug administration (lack of
retrograde amnesia) as well as implicit and semantic
memory (mintzer and grif®ths, 1999). these results
suggest that the explicit memory de®cit is due to an
impairment in acquisition, encoding and consolidation of word or picture stimuli but not in retrieval of
previously acquired information. zolpidem also
enhanced explicit and implicit memory for material
presented before drug administration, producing a
retrograde facilitation effect, as already described
with benzodiazepines and alcohol (ghoneim et al.,
1984; parker and weingartner, 1984; weingartner
et al., 1995; mintzer and grif®ths, 1999). in two studies (danjou et al., 1999b; hindmarch et al., 2001),
zolpidem was evaluated in healthy subjects under
more stringent conditions, with doses administered
in the middle of the night (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 h before
morning awakening) and residual effects assessed
hum psychopharmacol clin exp 2001; 16: 369±392.

the next  xxxd2476xxx  waking. the subjects had a
standardized bedtime, starting at midnight, and slept
until the time of drug administration, when they were
gently awakened to receive the drug in bed before
going back to sleep. the total time allowed for sleep
was 8 h. in one study, zolpidem 10 mg was shown to
possess residual effects on dsst and explicit memory
(ifr and dfr of words) after administration up to 5 h
before waking and on crt, cff threshold and
sternberg memory scanning after administration up
to 4 h before waking (danjou et al., 1999b). in the
other study, zolpidem 10 mg produced statistically
signi®cant detrimental residual effects on objective
psychomotor performance and attention tests up to
5 h (recognition reaction time), 3 h (total crt and
dsst) or 1 h (cff threshold, motor reaction time)
after dose administration as well as on anterograde
amnesia (decrease in dfr of words) up to 5 h after
(hindmarch et al., 2001). these results observed in
healthy subjects were con®rmed in insomniac
patients. residual effects were also encountered up
to 6 h after the dose for dsst and 7 h after for mslt
in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia (corser
et al., 2000; zammit, 2000). the ®nding of residual
effects up to 5±7 h after a middle-of-the-night
administration of zolpidem 10 mg suggest a longer
duration of action than that reported after a daytime
administration, i.e. the drug's impairing effect
disappeared within 3±4 h (balkin et al., 1992; patat
et al., 1994; berlin et al., 1993; rush and grif®ths,
1996; greenblatt et al., 1998; mintzer and grif®ths,
1999). pharmacokinetic changes were observed after
an evening administration of zolpidem, compared
with a morning administration, with a blunted plasma
peak concentration and a much slower elimination,
which may explain a prolonged duration of action
(allain et al., 1995). finally, zolpidem 10 mg and
20 mg were also shown to produce statistically significant deleterious effects on driving abilities after a
middle-of-the-night administration, i.e. 4 h after dosing, with average sdlp values exceeding placebo
levels by 3.5 cm (volkerts et al., 2000).
zaleplon possesses many of the properties of the
ideal hypnotic (dooley and plosker, 2000). zaleplon
is rapidly absorbed, has a rapid onset of action
reaching its tmax in less than 1 h and has a rapid elimination half-life (beer et al., 1994; greenblatt et al.,
1998; rosen et al., 1999). it has no active metabolite
(vanover et al., 1994). the hypnotic ef®cacy of
zaleplon was demonstrated by polysomnography
(consistent reduction of latency to persistent sleep
compared with placebo). no tolerance to the hypnotic
effect occurs after 4 to 5 weeks of treatment in

polysomnographic studies (walsh et al., 2000b;
cluydts, 2000; fry et al., 2000) and after more than
6 to 12 months in clinical trials (scharf, 1999; hedner
and mangano, 1999). the risk of rebound insomnia
after treatment with zaleplon has been shown to be
minimal, even after abrupt withdrawal (scharf,
1999; hedner and mangano, 1999; fry et al., 2000;
walsh et al., 2000b; cluydts, 2000). the abuse potential of zaleplon (at 2.5 to 7.5 times the therapeutic
dose) was similar to that of triazolam (at 1 to 3 times
the therapeutic dose) in subjects with a history of drug
of abuse (rush et al., 1999). zaleplon has a low
potential for clinically important drug interactions
(darwish, 1999a). zaleplon is safe in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (george
et al., 1999). finally, the present review shows that
the recommended 10 mg dose of zaleplon has no or
minimal residual effects when administered either in
the evening at bedtime or during the night.
indeed, the results of several studies of zaleplon
10 mg and 20 mg in healthy volunteers did not show
any clinically relevant detrimental residual effects on
psychomotor performance, memory and actual
driving when zaleplon was administered either in
the evening or in the middle of the night up to 2 h
before awakening (vermeeren et al., 1998, 2000;
danjou et al., 1999b; troy et al., 2000; hindmarch
et al., 2001; stone et al., 2000; volkerts et al.,
2000). eight studies were conducted with a middleof-the-night administration in either healthy subjects
(®ve studies) or patients with sleep maintenance
insomnia (three studies) (table 2). no residual effects
were demonstrated on objective performance (cff,
crt, dsst) and explicit memory tests (ifr and
dfr, sternberg memory scanning) after zaleplon
10 mg or 20 mg was administered as little as 2 h
before waking (danjou et al., 1999b; hindmarch
et al., 2001).
zaleplon 10 mg possessed only minimal residual
effects on dsst when administered 1 h before waking (hindmarch et al., 2001). in the other studies,
after a middle-of-the-night administration of zaleplon
10 mg 2±5 h before waking, no statistically signi®cant
residual effects were shown on the various psychometric tests used in healthy subjects or insomniac
patients (vermeeren et al., 1998; danjou et al.,
1999b; volkerts et al., 2000; stone et al., 2000;
hindmarch et al., 2001; zammit, 2000; corser et al.,
2000; scharf, 2000). when administered during the
day, zaleplon 10 mg also had minimal effect (statistically signi®cant decrease in dsst 1.5 h after dose
administration; roehrs et al., 2000) or no effect (not
statistically signi®cant) on psychomotor performance

and cognitive function even at peak plasma concentrations (drover et al., 1998, 2000; greenblatt
et al., 1998).
zaleplon 20 mg, twice the recommended dose,
administered either in the morning during daytime
or in the evening at bedtime or in the middle of the
night, produced signi®cant impairment only in some
performance and memory tasks (crt, dsst, divided
attention, ifr, dfr) at the time of tmax, i.e. around
1 h after the dose, and the subjects completely recovered 2±3 h after dose administration (allen et al.,
1993; roehrs et al., 2000; drover et al., 1998, 2000;
greenblatt et al., 1998). however, the effects of
zaleplon 20 mg were less marked than those observed
with the recommended dose of zolpidem (10 mg)
under the same experimental conditions (greenblatt
et al., 1998; drover et al., 1998, 2000; hindmarch
et al., 2001). a middle-of-the-night administration
of zaleplon 20 mg, 4±5 h before waking, did not
produce statistically signi®cant residual effects on
psychomotor performance or memory (vermeeren
et al., 1998; hindmarch et al., 2001; volkerts et al.,
2000; stone et al., 2000), except on long-term
memory in two studies (vermeeren et al., 1998; stone
et al., 2000). however, other studies with a similar
memory test did not demonstrate any signi®cant
effect on memory later than 1 h after the administration of zaleplon 20 mg (allen et al., 1993; drover
et al., 1998, 2000; greenblatt et al., 1998; hindmarch
et al., 2001; troy et al., 2000; volkerts et al., 2000).
finally, an evening or a middle-of-the-night administration (4 h before the driving test) of zaleplon
10 mg or 20 mg consistently did not produce any
signi®cant deleterious effect on driving abilities in
three actual driving studies, demonstrating a better
safety with zaleplon than with the other hypnotics
(vermeeren et al., 1998, 2000; volkerts et al., 2000).
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling of
zaleplon was performed using ef®cacy (latency to
persistent sleep) and impairment in psychomotor
performance (dsst) to assess the established
pharmacokinetic pro®le of zaleplon (darwish,
1999b). the magnitude of dsst impairment was
dose-dependent and the duration of impairment was
shown to increase with the dose. the ec50 (concentration required to produce 50% of the maximum
impairment) was 212 ng/ml. the percentage reduction in latency to persistent sleep increased with an
emax (maximum effect produced) of approximately
70%. by using this model, the predicted plasma level
to cause a 50% reduction in sleep latency was
estimated at 29±30 ng/ml, which is consistent with
concentrations obtained from a 10 mg dose. this
copyright # 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

result agrees with the data from individual studies,
which range from 39% to 59%, with an average of
47% in reduction of sleep latency. the peak effect
of a 10 mg dose was predicted to produce minimal
effect on dsst (reduction of approximately 10%).
these data show that the plasma concentration
required for improving sleep latency was substantially lower than that necessary to produce psychomotor/memory impairment. the model also indicated
that increasing the dose would not cause a further proportionate decrease in sleep latency. for example,
increasing the plasma concentration from 30 to
60 ng/ml would decrease sleep latency by only
another 5% to 8%. in contrast, a 50% reduction of
the dsst score would require a greater than 10-fold
increase in plasma concentration. thus, the model
suggests that the sopori®c effect of zaleplon is significantly separated from psychomotor impairment.
pooled data from various psychomotor and memory
tests used with zaleplon and the various positive
controls in these studies also con®rmed that zaleplon
possessed a signi®cantly better pharmacodynamic
safety pro®le, producing much less impairment than
its competitors at their recommended hypnotic dose
levels (danjou et al., 1999a; patat, 1999; darwish
et al., 2000). therefore zaleplon 10 mg is as potent
as the recommended dose of the other hypnotic drugs
in inducing sleep, but is much less potent than them in
producing detrimental residual effects on psychomotor and cognitive functions.
the differences in pharmacodynamic pro®les,
including residual effects, between zaleplon and
zolpidem are likely to be related to their pharmacokinetic as well as to their pharmacological pro®les.
zaleplon has a shorter half-life than zolpidem.
despite the fact that both compounds show a similar
selectivity for the 1 subunit of the gabaa macromolecular complex, zaleplon possesses a lower af®nity for that subunit than does zolpidem (sanger
et al., 1996; daèmgen and luèddens, 1999). this lower
af®nity of zaleplon for the brain  xxxd367xxx  receptor subtype
may also contribute to the minimal psychomotor and
memory impairment observed with the clinical dose
of zaleplon, even at peak concentration (allen et al.,
1993; danjou et al., 1998, 1999; drover et al., 1998,
2000; greenblatt et al., 1998; troy et al., 2000;
roehrs et al., 2000; hindmarch et al., 2001). zaleplon
clearly demonstrates a separation of the desired sleepinducing effect from unwanted psychomotor and
memory impairment as well as residual effects,
regardless of time of administration, allowing both
patient and physician an individualized approach to
hypnotic therapy. despite a similar potency with other
hum psychopharmacol clin exp 2001; 16: 369±392.

pharmacodynamic pro®le of zaleplon
hypnotic drugs for inducing sleep, zaleplon was
shown to be less potent in producing residual effects.
indeed, in terms of potency of effects on eeg beta
waves, psychomotor performance and memory,
zaleplon has a safety margin of 2- and 2.5-fold compared with zolpidem and triazolam, respectively, i.e.
zaleplon 20 mg produces similar or lower effects than
zolpidem 10 mg (greenblatt et al., 1998), and
zaleplon 25 mg produces similar effects to triazolam
0.25 mg in subjects with a history of drug of abuse
(rush et al., 1999). another study showed that
zaleplon 20 mg produces much less impairment of
psychomotor performance and memory tasks than
lorazepam 2 mg (allen et al., 1993). in addition,
zaleplon has a shorter duration of action on eeg beta
activity, psychomotor performance and memory, as its
cns effects measured on these parameters
disappeared within 2±3 h, in contrast to 4±5 h with
zolpidem and triazolam. moreover, the magnitude
of the eeg effects on beta activity is less pronounced
with zaleplon than with zolpidem. zolpidem also
produced an increase in slow-wave sleep (guieu
et al., 1996; nakajima et al., 2000), which is related
to its hypnotic activity. however, unfortunately no
analysis of slow delta and theta waves or alpha eeg
was done on the zaleplon studies.
finally, zaleplon displays a novel receptor
selectivity different from that of other benzodiazepine
or non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in clinical use. the
differential binding of various compounds to the  xxxd367xxx 
or bz2 receptors provides some clari®cation in differentiating the actions of various compounds acting
through the gabaa system. however, this is an oversimpli®cation. the heterogeneity of benzodiazepine
receptor binding sites and, in all likelihood, the potential selectivity for different actions result primarily
from the existence of various subunits ( , and )
that form the chloride channel that is opened by
gaba. the gabaa receptor is a pentametric protein
complex that comprises ®ve subunits. the association
of these subunits forms a chloride channel which is
opened by gaba. the subunits are different
proteins that can be classi®ed into families according
to their degree of structural homology. the principal
families are the , and subunits. the subunit
carries the bz-binding sites, the
subunit carries
the gaba recognition site and the subunit makes
possible the allosteric interaction between gaba
and the bz sites (pritchett et al., 1989; pritchett and
seeburg, 1991; olsen and tobin, 1990). gaba binds
to the subunit and opens the ion channels, and the
penetration of chloride ions underlies neuronal
inhibition.

all modern hypnotic drugs (benzodiazepines, zopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon) interact with binding sites
on the
subunit and facilitate channel opening in
response to gaba. the benzodiazepine receptor or
omega receptor, in fact, corresponds to the subunit
of the gabaa receptor. although all hypnotic drugs
bind to the same binding protein, the subunit of the
gabaa receptor, this site carries different binding
domains for different chemical classes of drugs. six
different isoforms of the subunit ( 1 to 6) have
been identi®ed. the 1 subunit, especially the 1 j
2 receptors, appears to be most closely associated
with the  xxxd367xxx  binding sites, and i j 2 receptors
(i 2, 3, 5; j  1, 3) all correlate to bz2 receptors.
the subunit in¯uences the intrinsic potency of bz
receptor ligands. for the three receptor subunits, the
presence of a 2 subunit is necessary to obtain a
gabaa receptor that is responsive to low concentrations of benzodiazepines (pritchett et al., 1989).
receptors containing the 3 subunit and particularly
the 1 subunit have a reduced af®nity for these drugs
(wafford et al., 1993).
zaleplon and zolpidem bind preferentially to 1containing ( xxxd367xxx ) receptors, whereas benzodiazepines
and zopiclone are aspeci®c. in addition, zolpidem and
zaleplon demonstrate a higher af®nity for the 1 2 2
receptor, which is the predominant gabaa receptor
composition found in the brain, than for all other
2-containing receptors. their af®nities were at least
10-fold higher for 1 2 2 than for 2 1 2, 3 3 2
or 5 3 2 receptors. whereas zolpidem did not
recognize 5 3 2 receptors, zaleplon displayed a
low af®nity for this receptor subtype. finally
zaleplon, but not zolpidem, recognizes 2- and 3containing receptors that additionally contain a j
and the 3 subunit (daèmgen and luèddens, 1999).
these data suggest that the 1 j 2 receptor subtype
may be the main mediator of the hypnotic properties
of ligands binding through the gabaa receptor
macromolecular complex (depoortere et al., 1998)
and show some binding differences between zaleplon
and zolpidem.
when a hypnotic is required to induce sleep, a swift
effect and a swift recovery of normal function are
generally equally important. when determining how
to treat insomnia, the clinician must examine how
seriously the patient's daytime functioning is affected
and how rapidly correction of daytime dysfunction is
needed. if pharmacotherapy is deemed necessary, the
lowest effective dose of the hypnotic with the shortest
half-life appropriate for the patient's needs is preferable because residual effects are related to dose and
half-life. up to now, the treatment of insomnia was

based on prophylactic hypnotic use, required in order
to restrict pharmacodynamic activity to the desired
sleep period and limit daytime sedation at the desired
wake time and thereafter. unfortunately such use also
eliminated the opportunity for the patient to attempt
sleep without the aid of medication.
the quick onset of action of zaleplon, combined
with its rapid elimination, permits the withholding
of medication until after the patient has attempted
sleep without success. therefore, given that the
occurrence of an individual's sleep problem is likely
to vary from night to night, a potential bene®t of
zaleplon may be a reduction in the requirement for
nightly prophylactic use of hypnotic medication.
therefore, zaleplon 10 mg would appear to be a
useful hypnotic for patients when they have dif®culty
falling asleep, whether at bedtime, in the middle of
the night or during the late-night hours, frees them
from worry about residual effects, since it has no signi®cant risk for the development of next-day impairment of psychomotor performance and cognitive
functioning, even 1 h after ingestion, and is free of
residual impairment of driving abilities 4 h after dose
administration. zaleplon's pharmacokinetic pro®le,
featuring rapid absorption, distribution and clearance,
and its receptor-binding and pharmacodynamic pro®les may well explain the lack of residual sedative
effects even after a middle-of-the-night administration. all these results suggest that zaleplon will prove
a useful hypnotic with some key advantages over
existing treatments for the management of insomnia
and sleep disturbances in ambulant patients performing their usual daytime functions and allowing
patients to take their medication only when needed
(i.e. when symptoms occur at bedtime or during the
night) and not necessarily on a nightly basis.
