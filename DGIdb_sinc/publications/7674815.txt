potency of these compounds on rat aorta was well correlated with the affinity

alb- and ala-subtypes. these results suggest that the aid-subtype plays a
determining role in rat aorta contractions

introduction
on the basis of both functional and radioligandbinding experiments, molecular
biological techniques and the use of selective antagonists, consensus was
achieved on the subdivision of the al-adrenoceptorsinto three different alsubtypes, namely ala-, alb- and aid-adrenoceptors(1,2).
the subtype(s) of al-adrenoceptorpresent in rat aorta have been variously
classified as alb (3,4), both ala and alb (5), or atypical (6,7). aboud et al.
(8) stated that contractions of rat aorta induced by noradrenaline (na) are
mediated by non-ala, non alb-adrenoceptors,due both to the high potency of the
ala-selective antagonists and the sensitivity to the selective sib-adrenoceptor
 xxxd3249xxx  chloroethylclonidine(cec).
in a recent paper (9) we characterizedthe al-adrenoceptorin rat aorta by
utilizing cec both in biochemical and functional studies, as well as by
correlating the functional potency of several al-adrenoceptorantagonists on
this tissue contracted with na with their affinity for the ala- and albadrenoceptor subtypes determined in rat hippocampus membranes pretreated with
cec (ala), and rat liver (ale) membranes. based on these studies, our
conclusion was that the na-induced contraction of this vessel is mediated by
the ale-subtype.

data analysis

arithmetic

mean f s.e..

the displacement curves of the antagonists on the at-adrenoceptorsubtypes were
analyzed by non-linear curve fitting of the logistic equation according to the
method reported by de lean et al. (16), utilizing the allfit program (from
n.i.h.). the icso values and pseudo-hill slope coefficients were estimated by
the program. the value for the inhibition constant, k,
i, was calculated by using
the "cheng and prusoff" equation (17).
in the isolated vascular preparations, 2-3 specimens, taken from different
animals, were utilized for each concentrationof the antagonists tested. only
one antagonist concentrationwas used for each preparation. the concentrationresponse curves were analyzed as reported for the binding studies. schild-plot
parameters (paz and slope) were evaluated by linear regression analysis. the
dose-ratios (drs) (ec50 ratios of na) observed after incubationwith the
different concentrationsof the antagonists were always corrected for timedependent changes in first and second curve locations, determined in vehicletreated time-matched control curves.
correlation analysis between the binding affinity of the antagonists for the
cloned al-adrenoceptor subtypes and their functional activity in rat aortic
strips was assessed by linear regression procedure (least-squares method),
using lotus computer program. stepwise regression analysis performed to test
the effect of adding predictors (pki) on the functional activity (paz) was
performed by the statgraphics (release 2.1) computer program.
