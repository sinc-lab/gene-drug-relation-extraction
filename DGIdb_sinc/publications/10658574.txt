abstractða radioiodinated probe, [125i]-cgp 71872, containing an azido group that can be photoactivated, was synthesized and
used to characterize gabab receptors. photoanity labeling experiments using crude membranes prepared from rat brain revealed
two predominant ligand binding species at 130 and 100 kda believed to represent the long (gababr1a) and short
(gababr1b) forms of the receptor. indeed, these ligand binding proteins were immunoprecipitated using a gabab receptorspeci®c antibody con®rming the receptor speci®city of the photoanity probe. most convincingly, [125i]-cgp 71872 binding was
competitively inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cold cgp 71872, gaba, saclofen, (ÿ)- xxxd278xxx , (+)- xxxd278xxx  and (l) xxxd2431xxx  with a rank order and stereospeci®city characteristic of the  xxxg828xxx . photoanity labeling experiments
revealed that the recombinant  xxxg828xxx  receptor does not bind [125i]-cgp 71872, providing surprising and direct evidence that
cgp 71872 is a  xxxg827xxx  selective antagonist. photoanity labeling experiments using rat tissues showed that both gababr1a
and gababr1b are co-expressed in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and testis, but only the short gababr1b receptor form was
detected in kidney and liver whereas the long gababr1a form was selectively expressed in the adrenal gland, pituitary, spleen and
prostate. we report herein the synthesis and biochemical characterization of the nanomolar anity [125i]-cgp 71872 and cgp
71872  xxxg827xxx  ligands, and dierential tissue expression of the long gababr1a and short gababr1b receptor forms in rat
and dog. # 1999 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

introduction
amino acids such as  xxxd2431xxx , g- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) and glycine are neurotransmitters that bind to
speci®c receptors in the vertebrate nervous system and
mediate synaptic transmission. of these amino acids,
gaba is the most widely distributed amino acid inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous
system. the biological activities of gaba are mediated
by three types of gaba receptors: ionotropic gabaa
receptors, metabotropic gabab g protein-coupled
receptors, and ionotropic gabac receptors. each type of
receptor has its own characteristic molecular structure,
key words: cgp 71872;  xxxg828xxx ; gaba; photoanity

mediated spectrum of physiological activities.

biology
gabab receptors were ®rst distinguished by hill and
bowery.1 based on their anatomical location and physiological functions, gabab receptors act presynaptically as
autoreceptors and heteroreceptors and also act postsynaptically. functionally, gabab receptors couple
through g proteins to neuronal k+ or ca2+ channels.
receptor activation leading to increased k+ conductance
is responsible for late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
(ipsps), whereas receptor mediated decrease in ca2+
conductance results in presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release. there is also evidence that  xxxg828xxx 
activation leads to inhibition or potentiates adenylyl
cyclase activity, although the functional signi®cance of

these second messenger changes remains unclear. the
molecular cloning of two members of the rat gabab
receptor family, gababr1a and gababr1b, was
®nally achieved by expression cloning by kaupmann et
al.2 using high-anity gabab cgp 64213 and cgp
71872 receptor antagonists. this pivotal paper, however, did not report the synthesis of these powerful
 xxxg828xxx  probes. in studying the recombinant
 xxxg827xxx  receptors and a gabab-like orphan gpr
51 receptor, now identi®ed as  xxxg828xxx , we and others
observed that both receptors are functionally inactive
when expressed individually in multiple heterologous
expression systems, and that the functional gabab
receptor is a heterodimer of  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx 
subtypes.3±7 however, our understanding of the molecular basis of gabab heterodimer activation and ligand
binding is still rudimentary. with the aim of clarifying
the pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential
of the functional  xxxg828xxx , we report herein the
detailed synthesis of [125i]-cgp 71872, the characteriza-

[ i]-cgp 71872 was derived from structure±activity relationship studies starting from the  xxxg828xxx  agonist
3-aminopropylphosphinic acid, a close analogue of g- xxxd2177xxx .2,8 it was designed to be a photoanity
probe: when bound to the receptor, the aryl azide function
can be activated by photolysis (360 nm) to generate a
highly reactive nitrene intermediate which can then react to
create a covalent bond with the surrounding protein.
[125i]-cgp 71872 was prepared in a manner similar to
its synthesis summarized in a patent,9±11 with some
modi®cations (scheme 1). the preparation of ethyl (1,1diethoxyethyl)phosphinate 1 from phosphinic acid and

m. belley et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 7 (1999) 2697±2704

triethyl orthoacetate under lewis acid catalysis using the
reported procedures10,12 gave low and non-reproducible
yields of 1, along with varying amounts of diethyl (1,1diethoxyethyl)phosphonate (eto)2cmepo(oet)2. reducing the temperature and the time of the reaction greatly
improved the preparation. deprotonation of 1 with
sodium hydride and reaction with n-(5-bromopentyl)phthalimide aorded 2, which was deprotected with
chlorotrimethylsilane to give the phosphinic acid 3. treatment of 3 with chlorotrimethylsilane and triethylamine
yielded a trivalent silylated phosphonite that is very sensitive to oxidation and should be ®ltered under argon and
concentrated with a high vacuum pump. reaction with
fused  xxxd3556xxx  and epichlorohydrin at 80 c (in the
absence of solvent) and hydrolysis of the silyl ether with
acetic acid yielded the intermediate 4. the (cyanophenyl)ethylamine 6 was prepared via a new route in three steps by
a chiral reduction with (ÿ)-b-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane13,14 followed by a mitsunobu reaction with
phthalimide and deprotection to the amine.15±17 substitution of the chlorine of 4 with the primary amine 6 aorded
the secondary amine 7. the nitrile was hydrolyzed with
naoh and the phthalimide removed with concentrated
hcl to yield the amine 8. this is reacted with the commercially available n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic
acid 9 to give the intermediate 10 which is iodinated to
cgp 71872 with chloramine t and sodium iodide.

results and discussion
since the ligand binding properties of cgp 71872 have not
been reported in detail previously, its characterization is
given herein. with the high speci®c activity of iodine
(2200 ci/mmol) attached to the ligand, the tissue distribution and the therapeutic potential of gabab receptors has
also been de®ned.
[125i]-cgp 71872 labels gababr1a and gababr1b
receptors, but not  xxxg828xxx  receptors
photolabeling experiments were carried out to characterize the substrate speci®city of [125i]-cgp 71872. upon
exposure to uv light, [125i]-cgp 71872 photolabeled
major bands at 130 and 100 kda in crude membranes
prepared from rat brain at the predicted molecular mass
reported for gababr1a and gababr1b receptors2
(fig. 1a). indeed,  xxxg828xxx  gb-1713.1 and gb1713.2 polyclonal antibodies but not preimmune sera were
able to immunoprecipitate these ligand binding species
(fig. 1b) con®rming the receptor speci®city of the ligand.
similar 130 and 100 kda ligand binding species were
observed in dog brain membranes (fig. 1c). faintly
labeled species at approximately twice the molecular mass
of the receptor monomers in rat and dog brain membranes suggest that  xxxg827xxx  receptors may undergo
homodimerization,18 also reported for the structurally
related metabotropic glutamate receptors.19
with the identi®cation of the functional  xxxg828xxx 
which requires the coexpression and heterodimerization of
 xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx  receptors,3±7 it seemed important to test whether the potent cgp 71872 antagonist can

label the  xxxg828xxx  receptor. photoanity labeling
experiments using 100 nm ®nal concentration of [125i]cgp 71872 revealed that the recombinant  xxxg828xxx 
receptor3±7 (when expressed in cos-7 cells) does not bind
the ligand, even though its expression was con®rmed by
immunoblot analysis (data not shown). this suggests that
[125i]-cgp 71872 is a  xxxg827xxx  receptor selective ligand
and that the  xxxg827xxx  subunit is primarily responsible for
ligand binding to the  xxxg827xxx ± xxxg828xxx  heterodimer.
the abundant brain expression of gababr1a and
gababr1b receptors suggests that both the long and
short gabab receptors contribute to the reported
gaba and  xxxd278xxx  activated g protein-gated inwardly
rectifying k+ channels and/or ca2+ channels which
have been implicated in hippocampal long-term potential, absence epilepsy, slow-wave sleep, muscle relaxation and antinociception activities.8,20
cgp 71872 exhibits nanomolar anity for gababr1a
and gababr1b receptors
displacement of [125i]-cgp 71872 binding to membranes prepared from whole brain in ®ltration-binding
experiments was in the appropriate rank order for
gabaergic ligands: cgp 71872 (ki 0.480.08 nm
(n=4) (meanstandard deviation)) > gaba (2.50
0.06 mm (n=3)) > saclofen (156.1345.88 mm
(n=3)) > (ÿ)- xxxd278xxx  (0.520.04 mm (n=3)) > (+) xxxd278xxx  (1.140.31 mm (n=3)) >  xxxd2431xxx 
(4.910.30 mm (n=3)) (fig. 2(a)). the anity of
 xxxd278xxx  in whole brain tissue is lower compared to
previous studies using brain cortex tissues.2 one explanation might be that the  xxxd278xxx  anity in whole brain
re¯ects binding to multiple and pharmacologically different  xxxg828xxx  subtypes that are not expressed
in brain cortex.  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx  receptors
are dierentially expressed in brain, especially in the
basal ganglia, where  xxxg827xxx  rna expression is
high whereas  xxxg828xxx  rna expression is low.3±7
since the  xxxg827xxx  receptor requires the coexpression
of the  xxxg828xxx  receptor for membrane targeting and
the formation of the functional  xxxg828xxx ,3±7 this

2700

m. belley et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 7 (1999) 2697±2704

suggests the existence of other gabab receptors in the
basal ganglia that would enable the formation of a
functional  xxxg828xxx  heterodimer. further,
 xxxg827xxx  receptor isoforms exhibit dierential cellular
and extrasynaptic localization in brain, suggesting dier-

ent pharmacology and functions.21,22 photoanity
labeling experiments showed that the long gababr1a
and short gababr1b receptor forms dier slightly in
their intensity of labeling, suggesting that the short form
may have a higher anity for cgp 71872 or is more
highly expressed compared to the long gababr1a
receptor (fig. 2(b)). taken together, cgp 71872 is the
highest anity ligand so far described with a ki of
0.5 nm at gababr1a and gababr1b receptors.
peripheral tissue expression of gababr1a and
gababr1b receptors
there is clear evidence of the functional importance of
gabab receptors in the brain, but the lack of high-anity  xxxg828xxx -speci®c ligands and low peripheral
expression have made it dicult to establish a clear role
for this receptor in gabaergic mechanisms outside the
cns.23,24 the potential importance of gabab receptors
in peripheral gabaergic functions is now supported by
photoanity labeling studies using the nanomolar cgp
71872 ligand in tissues prepared from rat and dog.

cgp 71872 labeling studies revealed long and short
 xxxg828xxx  proteins in stomach and testis tissues
(table 1, fig. 3). the known involvement of gabab
receptors in stomach physiology has been to mediate
gut relaxation by inhibition of postganglionic cholinergic nerves.23 the role(s) of gabab receptors outside a
nervous based mechanism of action is less clear. in the
isolated stomach, gaba has been localized to secretory
granules of gastric mucosal epithelium and shown to
modulate gastric acid secretion likely via gabaa
receptors.24,25 the morphological feature of gabab

would, however, support the expression of gabab
receptors in the stomach such that both gabaa and
gabab receptors may be involved in mediating the
local hormone actions of gaba on the secretion of
gastrin and somatostatin.27,28
a role for gabab receptors in the testis has not been
described and is unknown. gaba has been detected in
spermatozoa and presumably acts via gabaa receptors to regulate the motility of the spermatozoon.24
recent biochemical ®ndings have shown gaba modulation of androgen secretion in testicular tissue, probably by a direct action on endocrine cells of the testis,29
but the receptors involved remain to be determined.
the long form of the receptor, gababr1a, was
expressed absent of the short gababr1b receptor in
restricted peripheral tissues (table 1, fig. 3). [125i]-cgp
71872 labeled gababr1a in endocrine tissues such as
pituitary, adrenal gland, prostate, and epithelial tissues
such as spleen. gaba and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
have been shown to be localized to both anterior and
intermediate lobes of the pituitary,24 suggesting that
gababr1a receptor activation may contribute to
gaba mediated decrease in  xxxd1752xxx -releasing
hormone, prolactin-releasing factor,  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  levels including increasing androgen production.30 indeed,  xxxd278xxx , a selective  xxxg828xxx 
agonist, exhibits robust inhibition of pituitary secretions.30 we observed gababr1a expression in the adrenal gland. although its role in local hormone actions is
not known, gabab receptors have been reported to
modulate acetylcholine-evoked catecholamine release.24
a role for gababr1a receptors in prostate and spleen
physiology is less clear. much of the evidence suggests a
role for the gabaa receptor in the immune modulatory
role of gaba on the proliferation of thymic cells and of
spleen lymphocytes.24 the localization of gababr1a in
spleen suggests that this  xxxg828xxx  form may be
important as well. no information is available about
gabab receptors in the prostate although its expression
was detected by [125i]-cgp 71872 binding.
[125i]-cgp 71872 revealed selective expression of the
short gababr1b receptor form in exocrine and epithelial
tissues such as kidney and liver (table 1, fig. 3). gaba
is believed to have a possible role in renal ammoniagenesis and in the function of proximal tubular cells.23

2701

the biological actions of gaba in these regions are likely
mediated via gabaa receptors,31 although  xxxd278xxx 
binding studies have indicated expression of gabab
receptors in the kidney as well.32 the demonstration of
high-anity gaba uptake sites on hepatocytes, localization of gaba and gad on these cells, and demonstration of bicuculline-sensitive (gabaa receptor) gaba
binding support a gabaergic component to bile secretion.24,33 the localization of gababr1b to this exocrine
tissue may suggest an in¯uence on bile secretion as well.
we showed for the ®rst time dierential peripheral tissue
expression of the long gababr1a and short
gababr1b receptor forms. because the functional
 xxxg828xxx  is a  xxxg827xxx ± xxxg828xxx  heterodimer, this suggests that possibly gababr1a±
 xxxg828xxx  and gababr1b± xxxg828xxx  heterodimers
mediate dierent physiological functions, thus accounting
for the diverse biological activities of gaba. clearly
more detailed in situ hybridization studies are needed to
con®rm that the expression of gabab receptors is not
con®ned to nerve tissue within the periphery. gabab
receptors were not detected in a number of tissues: trachea, heart, lymph node, peripheral blood leukocytes,
bone marrow, skeletal muscle, small intestine, colon,
ovary, pancreas, thyroid, thymus, and lung. one explanation for the eects of the  xxxg828xxx  agonists
such as  xxxd278xxx  on the physiology of some of these
organs may be that it involves central gabab receptors
or that other  xxxg828xxx  forms not labeled by cgp
71872 remain to be discovered at the molecular level.
experimental
synthesis of [125i]-cgp 71872; general comments
n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid was purchased from pierce. many intermediates in the synthesis
are hard to reveal on tlc (silica gel): they have to be
spotted heavily (a whole drop of reaction mixture from a
pipette), checked by uv and revealed with iodine followed
by a cerium/molybdate dip to give, sometimes, only faint
and diuse spots. the chemical shifts of the protons for
compounds 6, 7, 9 and cgp 71872 also vary from one
sample to another due to ph variation and/or contamination by solvents or impurities such as i-pr2net.acoh or
nh4oac. mass spectrometry was used often to follow
reactions and to identify the product distribution.

the fractions containing [125i]-cgp 71872 (1.24 mci; 25%
radiochemical yield) were concentrated to a ®nal volume of
2 ml.
preparation of membrane fractions
p2 membrane fractions were prepared at 4 c. tissues
were washed twice with cold pbs, collected by centrifugation at 100g for 7 min, and resuspended in
10 ml of buer a: 5 mm tris±hcl, 2 mm edta containing (1x) protease inhibitor cocktail complete2
tablets (boehringer mannheim), ph 7.4 at 4 c. tissues
were disrupted by polytron homogenization, centrifuged
at 100g for 7 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei,
and the supernatant collected. the resulting pellet was
homogenized a second time in 10 ml of buer a, centrifuged as described above and supernatant fractions
saved. the pooled s1 supernatant was centrifuged at
high speed (40,000g for 20 min) and the pellet was
washed once with buer a, centrifuged (40,000g for
20 min) and resuspended in buer a to make the p2
membrane fraction, and stored at ÿ80 c. protein content was determined using the bio-rad protein assay
kit according to manufacturer instructions.
receptor ®lter-binding assays
competition of [125i]-cgp 71872 binding experiments
were performed with 7 mg p2 membrane protein and
increasing concentrations of cold ligand (10ÿ12±10ÿ3
m). the concentration of radioligand used in the competition assays was 1 nm (®nal). each concentration
was examined in duplicate and incubated for 2 h at 22 c
in the dark in a total volume of 250 ml binding buer:
50 mm tris±hcl, 2.5 mm cacl2 (ph 7.4) with (1x)
protease inhibitor cocktail complete2 tablets. bound
ligand was isolated by rapid ®ltration through a brandel
96-well cell harvester using whatman gf/b ®lters. data
were analyzed by non-linear least-squares regression
using the computer-®tting program graphpad prism
version 2.01 (san diego).
photoanity labeling
p2 membranes were resuspended in binding buer, and
incubated in the dark with 1 nm ®nal concentration
[125i]-cgp 71872 (2200 ci/mmol) in a ®nal volume of
1 ml for 2 h at 22 c. the membranes were centrifuged
at 40,000g for 10 min and the pellet was washed in icecold binding buer, centrifuged at 40,000g for 20 min
and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold binding buer and

by centrifugation and solubilized in sample buer
(50 mm tris±hcl ph 6.5, 10% sds, 10% glycerol, and
0.003% bromophenol blue with 10% 2- xxxd26xxx ). samples were electrophoresed on precast novex
10% tris±glycine gels, ®xed, dried and exposed to
kodak xar ®lm with an intensifying screen at ÿ70 c.
 xxxg828xxx  antibodies
amino acids 212±227 (dvnsrrdilpdyelklc)
and 333±346 (catlhnptrvklfek) within the nterminus of the rat gababr1a were chosen as immunogenic peptides. identical sequences are shared with
the gababr1b receptor, but no signi®cant homology
to other g protein-coupled receptors was found after
querying the genbank database. anity puri®ed rabbit
 xxxg828xxx  polyclonal antibody 1713.1 (acetyldvnsrrdilpdyelklc-amide) and 1713.2 (acetylcatlhnptrvklfek-amide) were custom prepared
by quality control biochemicals (hopkinton, ma).
brie¯y, immunogenic peptides were incubated with thiol
coupling gel (1 mg of peptide for 1 ml of gel) and nonspeci®c sites on the gel blocked. the peptide-coupled gel
was incubated with serum, and bound antibody eluted
with glycine buer and dialyzed.
solubilization and immunoprecipitation of receptors
membranes were prepared by sonication in buer a as
described. the pellet was resuspended and stirred at 4 c
overnight in 2 ml of freshly prepared solubilization buer
consisting of 100 mm nacl, 10 mm tris±hcl, ph 7.4,
2% digitonin, and 5 mm edta with (1x) protease inhibitor cocktail complete2 tablets. the homogenate was
centrifuged at 40,000g for 20 min and the solubilized
fraction were washed with 10 ml cold buer c: 100 mm
nacl, 10 mm tris±hcl, ph 7.4, with protease inhibitors
and concentrated in centriprep 30 cartridges (amicon).
solubilized receptors were immunoprecipitated during
agitation with rabbit preimmune serum or gabab
receptor antibodies 1713.1 and 1713.2 (1:1000 dilution
each) and agarose ®xed goat anti-primary igg (1:40 dilution) (sigma, mo). the immunoprecipitate was washed
six times with 5 volumes of cold buer c for 20 min,
solubilized in sds sample buer, sonicated and electrophoresed on 10% tris±glycine gels as described.
