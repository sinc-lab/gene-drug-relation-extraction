abstract
background: lapatinib is an oral, small-molecule,
reversible inhibitor of both  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) and human  xxxg681xxx 
receptor–2 (her2) tyrosine kinases. in march 2007,
the us food and drug administration approved lapatinib for use in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the
treatment of advanced breast cancer overexpressing
her2 (her2+).
objectives: the goals of this review were to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy,
and tolerability of lapatinib, and to review studies of
the approved and investigational uses of lapatinib.
methods: english-language reports of clinical trials
of lapatinib in patients with cancer were identified
through searches of pubmed/medline (1990–october
2009) and the american society of clinical oncology
abstracts database (2003–2008). search terms included lapatinib, tykerb, her2, egfr, breast cancer, dual
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, and  xxxd2445xxx .
results: lapatinib was well tolerated in a phase ii
monotherapy trial in patients with advanced breast
cancer; however, the response was minimal in her2+
patients, and no her2– patients achieved an objective tumor response. a phase ii trial of lapatinib
monotherapy in 39 her2+ patients with breast cancer and brain metastases yielded 1 partial response,
although 15.4% of patients had stable disease for
≥16 weeks. in a phase iii trial comparing lapatinib plus
 xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx  alone in her2+ patients with advanced breast cancer that had progressed
after trastuzumab therapy, the median time to progression was 8.4 months with combination therapy,
compared with 4.4 months with  xxxd425xxx  alone
(p < 0.001). there were no significant differences between combination therapy and  xxxd425xxx  alone in
2332

terms of the overall response rate (22% and 14%,
respectively) or overall survival.
conclusions: lapatinib monotherapy was well tolerated, although the response rate was low in patients
with advanced breast cancer. lapatinib combined
with  xxxd425xxx  was associated with significant improvements in the time to progression and response
rate compared with  xxxd425xxx  alone. the available
evidence suggests that clinical efficacy in breast cancer
is limited to her2+ disease. (clin ther. 2009;31[theme

introduction
the type i family of  xxxg2198xxx  (tk) receptors
includes 4 homologous members:  xxxg682xxx , also known as
 xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr); erbb2, also
known as human  xxxg681xxx  receptor–2
(her2);  xxxg722xxx ; and  xxxg723xxx . the multidomain proteins forming these receptors contain an extracellular
ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tk domain. egfr, her2,
and  xxxg723xxx  are catalytically active;  xxxg722xxx  does not
have tk activity, but retains ligand-binding and signaltransduction function.1 the  xxxg682xxx  receptors are regulated by a family of peptide ligands that include egf
and transforming growth factor–alpha. on activation

 xxxg682xxx  receptor family (except her2,1 which has no

deregulation of the pathways controlled by these
receptors can arise from overexpression and/or mutations resulting in constitutively activated receptors.
such deregulation has been linked to the initiation
and spread of many human malignancies.4 erbbtargeted tk inhibitors have been used in clinical practice, including the potent and selective egfr inhibitors gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx .6,8 others, such as  xxxd421xxx ,
are still under investigation. these compounds share a
common 4-anilinoquinazoline core but have distinct
 xxxg682xxx -inhibition profiles and mechanisms of action.
a substantial proportion of breast and ovarian
cancers overexpress her2, which is associated with a
poor prognosis.9 her2 overexpression appears to lead
to spontaneous ligand formation, triggering ligandindependent activation of the kinase domain. many
human tumors expressing her2 display autocrine
stimulation of egfr in addition to her2 autodimerization.10 this interaction between egfr and her2

known extracellular ligand) recruits signaling proteins.
her2 functions as a coreceptor and is the preferred
partner for the other 3  xxxg682xxx  family members.2 the
 xxxg682xxx  receptors then undergo homodimerization or
heterodimerization, resulting in tyrosine autophosphorylation (excluding erbb31) and activation of signal
transduction pathways.3
multiple signal transduction pathways lie downstream
of these activated receptors, including the mitogenactivated protein kinase (mapk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathways. phospholipase cgamma and
stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription)
also lie downstream of the  xxxg682xxx  receptors. the outcome
of signaling may regulate cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, or cell adhesion.4–7 the biological response to receptor activation depends on the downstream effects on gene expression. a schematic
representation of the  xxxg682xxx  family members and their
downstream signaling molecules is shown in the figure.

may contribute to the increased rates of proliferation
associated with tumor development. jannot et al11
found that loss of erbb2 function inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells displaying  xxxg682xxx  autocrine activation. the crucial role of egfr and her2 in
cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival
provides a strong rationale for inhibition of both
egfr and her2 in the treatment of tumors with
abnormal egfr or her2 signaling.
metastatic breast cancer accounts for >40,000 deaths
each year in the united states alone.12 approximately
one fourth of breast cancers overexpress her2,13
placing patients at increased risk for disease progression and death.14 progress in the treatment of her2+
breast cancer has been achieved by targeting her2
signaling pathways. trastuzumab is a humanized
monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of the her2 receptor. approved by the us food
and drug administration (fda) in 1998, it has
been the basis of therapy for patients with her2+
metastatic breast cancer, although resistance ultimately develops.15,16
lapatinib* is an orally available, small-molecule,
reversible inhibitor of both egfr and her2 tks.17,18
in march 2007, the fda approved lapatinib for use in
combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the treatment of
advanced her2-amplified (her2+) breast cancer.19,20
like trastuzumab, lapatinib is indicated only for the
treatment of her2+ breast cancer. the goals of this
review were to summarize the pharmacokinetics,
pharmacology, efficacy, and tolerability of lapatinib,
and to review studies of lapatinib’s approved and investigational uses. the main focus was on breast cancer, although some other malignancies are included.

methods
english-language reports of clinical studies of lapatanib in patients with cancer were identified through
searches of pubmed/medline (1990–october 2009)
and the american society of clinical oncology (asco)
abstracts database (2003–2008). search terms included lapatinib, tykerb, her2, egfr, breast cancer, dual  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, and  xxxd2445xxx .
additional publications were identified through
searches of the reference lists of identified articles. all
identified clinical studies were included in the review.

establishment of her2 positivity in
breast cancer
her2 status is routinely assessed in pathologic breast
cancer specimens. consensus suggests that immunohistochemistry (ihc) should be performed first, and
then, if the results are equivocal, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (fish).21 ihc involves staining breast
tumor tissue with an antibody directed toward her2,
after which a pathologist evaluates the extent of staining. no membrane staining or staining in ≤10% of
tumor cells is categorized as 0, and faint/barely perceptible membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells is
categorized as 1+. patients with 0 or 1+ staining are
not considered candidates for lapatinib or trastuzumab therapy and do not require further testing.21
weak/moderately complete membrane staining in
>10% of tumor cells is categorized as 2+.22 tissues that
are 2+ on ihc are considered equivocal for egfr amplification and are next evaluated by fish, which
detects chromosome copies of the her2 gene. fish
evaluation involves dividing the total number of
her2 genes on 20 cancer cell nuclei by the total number on the reference gene (cep17). fish positive is
defined as a ratio ≥2, indicating twice as many her2
genes as on the reference gene, and the patient is considered a candidate for trastuzumab or lapatinib
therapy. strong complete membrane staining in >10%
of tumor cells is categorized as 3+, and patients are
considered candidates for trastuzumab or lapatinib
therapy without fish testing.22

pharmacology
lapatinib (originally known as  xxxd2445xxx ) is a
4-anilinoquinoline derivative. it is a large head group
quinazoline and differs in structure from small head
group quinazolines such as  xxxd2029xxx .17 lapatinib’s
bulky aniline head group reaches deep into an opened
back pocket of egfr. this large head group may
explain lapatinib’s slow dissociation rate relative to
other quinazolines, with a dissociation half-life of
>300 minutes from the egfr and subsequent prolonged inhibition of egfr. lapatinib binds the kinase
atp-binding cleft of  xxxg682xxx  during its inactive conformation17; however, it may not readily bind activestate  xxxg682xxx .23
lapatinib potently but reversibly binds to the intracellular tk domains of egfr and her2, leading to
inhibition of substrate phosphorylation. this inhibition blocks downstream mapk and pi3k proliferavolume 31 theme issue

tion and survival signaling pathways both in vitro and
in vivo.24,25 depending on tumor type, lapatinibtreated cells may undergo either apoptosis or growth
arrest. lapatinib is highly potent, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of <0.2 mum for both egfr
and her2.17 in addition, lapatinib is selective for
egfr and her2. when tested against a panel of other
kinases, lapatinib had ic50 values that were >1000-fold
greater than those required for egfr and her2.25
lapatinib effectively inhibits human tumor cell
lines that overexpress egfr or her2, indicating
selectivity for cancer cells that overexpress these receptors.26 in murine xenograft models, lapatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of egfr and erbb2,
as well as downstream mapk/ xxxg1369xxx /2 and pi3kappa/akt
pathways.25,27 preclinical trials in rodents and dogs
indicated no evidence of cardiac toxicity, despite high
exposure over several months.

doses up to 1800 mg/d were tested in phase i studies.29 sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned
to receive lapatinib 500, 650, 900, 1000, 1200, or
1600 mg/d continuously for 21 days. tmax occurred
3 to 6 hours after dosing, and nearly 2-fold accumulation (auc and cmax) was seen on day 20 after repeated
dosing. although variable, the cmax, cmin, and auc
generally increased with increasing dose (table i).
twice-daily dosing of lapatinib at doses up to
900 mg bid was explored early in phase i testing.29
division of the total daily dose resulted in roughly
twice the drug exposure. in subsequent phase i studies, burris et al30 noted an association between diarrhea and the lapatinib dose, but not the concentration.
the occurrence of diarrhea may, therefore, be partly
the result of local effects on the gut epithelium. a
lower divided dose might reduce the amount of unabsorbed drug and theoretically reduce the frequency
and severity of diarrhea.31

pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of
lapatinib were studied in healthy volunteers.28 sixteen subjects received single doses of lapatinib ranging from 10 to 250 mg, and 27 subjects received
lapatinib doses ranging from 25 to 175 mg/d for
8 consecutive days. lapatinib was well tolerated at
repeated doses up to 175 mg/d. in the multiple-dose
study, the auc0–∞ increased with repeated dosing,
with a geometric mean slope of 1.17 (90% ci, 1.09–
1.25). the mean t1/2 ranged from 6 to 9 hours, increasing in a dose-dependent manner. tmax occurred
at 3 to 4 hours. in the multiple-dose study, the mean
t1/2 was ~7 hours on day 1 and increased to 11 hours
on day 8 at the highest studied dose (175 mg). tmax
occurred at 3 to 4 hours and did not change significantly over time.

drug and food interactions
drug effects
lapatinib is eliminated through excretion in the
feces and hepatic metabolism. hepatic metabolism
occurs principally via cytochrome p450 (cyp)
3a4.19,32 a clinical study in healthy volunteers found
that concurrent administration of the strong cyp3a4
inhibitor ketoconazole increased the lapatinib auc
and prolonged the t1/2, and that concurrent administration of the cyp3a4 inducer carbamazepine reduced the auc of lapatinib by 72%.19 therefore,
strong inhibitors of cyp3a4, including grapefruit
juice, should be avoided, as they may increase plasma
concentrations of lapatinib and thus lapatinib toxicity.
if a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor must be used concurrently, reduction of the lapatinib dose to 500 mg/m2

may be considered. concurrent use of strong inducers
of cyp3a4 may lower plasma concentrations of lapatinib and decrease efficacy, and should also be avoided. if strong inducers must be administered concurrently, dose escalation based on tolerability may be
considered.19
at clinically relevant concentrations, lapatinib is also
an inhibitor of cyp3a4 and  xxxg586xxx .19 when cancer
patients on lapatinib received midazolam, a drug metabolized by cyp3a4, the auc of midazolam was increased by ~50%. drugs metabolized by cyp3a4 and
 xxxg586xxx  should be avoided or used with caution in
patients receiving lapatinib. in addition, modifications
in gastric ph may affect absorption of lapatinib. it has
been recommended that antacids be avoided for 1 hour
before and after lapatinib use.19 table ii lists drugs
with the potential to interact with lapatinib.

phase i studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetics
of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy generally found no clinically significant drug interactions.
chu et al33 evaluated the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib (dose range, 1250–1500 mg/d continuously) in
combination with  xxxd425xxx  (dose range, 1500–
2500 mg/m2/d for 14 days) on a 21-day schedule in
18 patients with advanced solid malignancies and
found no statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib. siegel-lakhai et al34 studied lapatinib in combination with folfox4 (oxaliplatin,  xxxd2462xxx , and 5-fluorouracil [5-fu]) in patients
with solid tumors. after establishment of the optimal
therapeutic regimen (otr) of lapatinib in combination with folfox4, the second part of the study assessed the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib, oxaliplatin,
and 5-fu alone and in combination. no interactions

between lapatinib and the folfox4 regimen were
observed.
further pharmacokinetic assessment was conducted in 27 patients (an expanded cohort) receiving the
otr in a phase i study of lapatinib combined with
trastuzumab.35 the pharmacokinetic parameters of
lapatinib and trastuzumab were not significantly affected by concomitant administration. in contrast,
midgley et al36 reported an interaction between irinotecan and lapatinib in patients receiving  xxxd467xxx 
(irinotecan,  xxxd2462xxx , and 5-fu). concurrent administration of lapatinib increased the auc of sn-38, the
active metabolite of irinotecan, by 41%; no other pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. irinotecan is
partially metabolized by cyp3a437; thus, coadministration of lapatinib may have led to an increase in the
active metabolite of irinotecan. this suggests a need to
reduce the recommended phase ii dose of irinotecan
when this drug is given in combination with lapatinib.

food effects
absorption of lapatinib is impaired by low solubility and first-pass metabolism by cyp3a4/5.30 in addition, clinical pharmacokinetic studies have indicated
that consumption of a high-fat breakfast (54 g fat)
and a low-fat meal (2 g fat) increased the lapatinib
auc and cmax.38,39 after the low-fat meal, the lapatinib auc was increased by a mean of 167% compared with the fasted state (hazard ratio [hr] = 2.67;
90% ci, 2.26–3.16); after the high-fat breakfast, it
was increased by 325% compared with the fasted
state (hr = 4.25; 90% ci, 3.60–5.02). although some
authors have recommended exploiting this food–drug
effect by using lower doses of lapatinib and thus decreasing costs,31 others have found substantial interpatient variability in the effect of food on bioavailability, with 68% variability in exposure between
patients, even when they had eaten an identical meal.39
given the unpredictable variability in plasma concentrations with food, the difficulty of maintaining a
standard diet with chronic dosing, and the risk of
adverse effects secondary to high interpatient variability, a conservative approach would be to administer
lapatinib on an empty stomach.39

nal dysfunction should not be necessary. although
lapatinib has not been extensively studied in patients
with hepatic dysfunction, preliminary studies suggest
increased exposure to lapatinib in those with severe
hepatic impairment (child-pugh class c), and dose reduction should be considered.19
lapatinib administration has not been studied in
pregnant or nursing women.19 there is a published
case report of a woman who received lapatinib for
~11 weeks (through a clinical trial) during the first
and second trimesters of pregnancy.40 she delivered a
healthy baby at the end of an uncomplicated pregnancy. while lapatinib displayed no mutagenic effects
in rats or rabbits, its use during human pregnancy or
lactation should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks to the mother and fetus.19

clinical trials and therapeutic uses
phase i studies
monotherapy
initial studies of lapatinib explored both daily and
twice-daily dosing. however, because the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib allow daily dosing, that was the
schedule selected for further study.41
burris et al30 conducted a phase i clinical trial of
lapatinib in 67 patients with advanced solid malignancies. lapatinib was tolerated at daily doses up to
1600 mg/d, with clinical activity at doses as low as
500 mg/d. a maximum tolerated dose was not
reached, and dose escalation was limited instead by
the pill burden.33 dose-limiting toxicities consisted of
diarrhea and skin rash. four of the 30 patients in the
trial with advanced breast cancer, all her2+, had a
partial response (pr) to therapy. all 4 of these patients
had progressed while receiving previous trastuzumab
and taxane- or anthracycline-based chemotherapy. an
additional 3 patients with breast cancer achieved stable disease (sd) for ≥6 months.
minami et al42 reported similar findings from a
comparable phase i study conducted in japan. pharmacokinetic values were similar to those in western
patients. common toxicities included rash, diarrhea,
anorexia, fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and emesis. the
lapatinib dose recommended by these authors for
phase ii testing was 1600 mg/d given continuously.

(a lapatinib analogue) and 5-fu, the active metabolite
of  xxxd425xxx ,43 a phase i trial of lapatinib in combination with  xxxd425xxx  was conducted in patients
with advanced solid malignancies.33 forty-five patients
were enrolled overall, with 21 enrolled at the otr for
pharmacokinetic characterization. the recommended
phase ii dose was  xxxd425xxx  2000 mg/m2 daily for
14 days and lapatinib 1250 mg/d continuously on a
21-day cycle. evidence of antitumor activity was seen
in breast, colon, lung, renal, and head and neck cancer.
these data were initially presented at asco 2004 and
published in 2007,33 forming the rationale for a phase
iii study in her2+ breast cancer.20
lapatinib has also been studied in combination
with other cancer therapies, include taxanes,44 carboplatin,45 and pegylated liposomal anthracycline.46
table iii provides a summary of studies of lapatinib combination therapy.

phase ii-iii studies in breast cancer
monotherapy
burstein et al51 reported the results of a multicenter,
open-label, phase ii study of lapatinib monotherapy in
patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
one hundred forty patients were her2+ and 89 were
her2–. patients were heavily pretreated; the her2+
patients had progressed after ≥6 weeks of treatment
with trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy. additional eligibility criteria included
eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status ≥2, archived tumor tissue, and normal cardiac ejection fraction. patients received lapatinib 1500 mg once daily until the occurrence of disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity. the response rate
(rr) was the primary end point. the mean daily dose
was 1484 mg/d, and the mean duration of treatment
was 8 weeks. most patients (65%) discontinued
therapy as a result of disease progression. on independent review, the rr was 1.4% among her2+ patients,
with an additional 4.3% achieving sd for ≥24 weeks.
no her2– patients achieved an objective tumor response or had evidence of clinical benefit (based on sd).
this lack of efficacy in her2– patients was consistent
with the reports by johnston et al52 and crown et al.44
gomez et al53 published the results of a multicenter,
randomized, open-label, phase ii study that compared
the efficacy and tolerability of lapatinib 1500 mg
once daily or 500 mg bid as first-line monotherapy in
138 patients with her2+ advanced or metastatic breast
2338

cancer. previous receipt of adjuvant trastuzumab
therapy was permitted, as long as it had been discontinued 12 months before enrollment. patients who
had received previous treatment for metastatic disease
other than endocrine therapy were excluded. the
overall rr was 24%, and there was no significant
difference in rr between treatment groups (22% for
once-daily dosing; 26% for twice-daily dosing). the
median time to response was 7.9 weeks, and the median time to treatment failure was 16.1 weeks, with
no significant difference in either between groups.

combination therapy
geyer et al20 reported the results of a randomized,
open-label, phase iii study comparing lapatinib plus
 xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx  alone. patients had
advanced or metastatic her2+ breast cancer that had
progressed during treatment with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. the exclusion criteria included
previous use of  xxxd425xxx . patients were randomized to receive either lapatinib 1250 mg/d continuously plus  xxxd425xxx  2000 mg/m2/d or  xxxd425xxx 
2500 mg/m2/d alone.  xxxd425xxx  was divided into
twice-daily doses given for 14 days on a 21-day cycle.
the primary end point was time to progression (ttp),
with secondary end points that included overall survival (os), rr, progression-free survival (pfs), and
tolerability.
the study enrolled 324 women, and >90% of patients received the assigned treatment.20 the median
ttp with combination therapy was 8.4 months, compared with 4.4 months with  xxxd425xxx  alone (hr =
0.49; 95% ci, 0.34–0.71; p < 0.001). the rr was
22% for combination therapy and 14% for  xxxd425xxx  alone (p = ns). the 1 complete response in the
study occurred in the combination-therapy group.
there was no significant difference in median os between groups (36 and 35 deaths in the combination
therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively; hr =
0.92; 95% ci, 0.58–1.46). based on the results of
this study, lapatinib was approved by the fda for use
in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in patients with
her2+ metastatic breast cancer that had progressed
during trastuzumab therapy.
in an updated efficacy analysis including an additional 6 months of follow-up, cameron et al54 reported that the difference in ttp between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups remained
significant (hr = 0.57; p < 0.001). given the long t1/2

of trastuzumab, residual trastuzumab may have augmented the clinical activity of lapatinib and affected
the initial results reported by geyer et al.20 therefore,
cameron et al also examined the data for a potential
effect of the interval between the last dose of trastuzumab and randomization to lapatinib/ xxxd425xxx 
combination therapy or  xxxd425xxx  alone. they
found that the hr for pfs was 0.59 (95% ci, 0.40–
0.86) for patients enrolled ≤8 weeks from the last dose
of trastuzumab, compared with 0.56 (95% ci, 0.35–
0.91) for patients enrolled >8 weeks from the last dose
of trastuzumab, suggesting no effect of trastuzumab
on lapatinib activity.

breast cancer with brain metastases
there is increasing awareness that the brain may be
a sanctuary site for metastatic tumor cells in women
with her2+ breast cancer receiving trastuzumab
therapy.55 there is currently no standard of care for
2340

the treatment of brain metastases apart from steroids,
radiotherapy, or surgery.56 thus, lapatinib’s ability to
cross the blood–brain barrier is clinically intriguing.
preclinical data indicated that lapatinib may prevent
the growth of brain metastases in a mouse xenograft
model.57
a phase ii study evaluated the efficacy and safety
profile of lapatinib in 39 patients with her2+ breast
cancer that had metastasized to the brain.58 eligible
patients had her2+ breast cancer and documented
progression of brain metastases after whole-brain
radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, or both; had
received previous trastuzumab therapy; and had
≥1 measurable lesion, an ecog performance status
≤2, and a life expectancy ≥12 weeks. lapatinib 750 mg
bid was administered continuously on a 28-day cycle.
the primary end point was rr in the central nervous
system (cns). only 1 patient (2.6%) had a pr, although 15.4% of patients achieved sd at both cns
volume 31 theme issue

a.j. tevaarwerk and j.m. kolesar
and non-cns sites for ≥16 weeks. an exploratory
analysis of volumetric change in cns lesions suggested
that patients who experienced ≥10% volumetric reduction at 8 weeks had a longer ttp than did those with
less or no volumetric reduction (3.5 vs 1.8 months,
respectively; p = 0.04).
the findings of geyer et al20 suggested that combination lapatinib/ xxxd425xxx  therapy may prevent or
delay progression of disease in the cns. these investigators noted that 11 women in the monotherapy
group had progressive cns metastases, compared
with only 4 women in the combination-therapy group.
although this difference was not statistically significant, it has prompted further investigation.
lin et al59 evaluated 242 patients with her2+
breast cancer and progressive brain metastases after
previous trastuzumab treatment and cranial radiotherapy. patients were initially treated with singleagent lapatinib 750 mg po bid. based on the results
of the study by geyer et al,20 the study protocol was
amended to allow patients with progressive cns
disease to continue lapatinib with the addition of
 xxxd425xxx . the primary end point was the cns
objective response, defined as ≥50% volumetric reduction in cns lesion(s) in the absence of increasing
steroid use, progressive neurologic signs and symptoms, or progressive extra-cns disease. the cns
objective rr with single-agent lapatinib was 6%, although 21% of patients had a ≥20% volumetric reduction in cns lesions. of the 50 patients who entered the lapatinib plus  xxxd425xxx  extension, 20%
had a cns objective response and 40% had a ≥20%
volumetric reduction in cns lesions.
an analysis of rates of brain metastases is being
conducted in patients enrolled in leap (lapatinib
expanded access program) and atu (french authorisation temporaire d’utilisation), and additional trials of the combination of cepecitabine and lapatinib
for brain metastasis are ongoing.
table iv provides a summary of published clinical
trials supporting the use of lapatinib in her2+ breast
cancer.

inflammatory breast cancer
inflammatory breast cancer (ibc) accounts for a
small proportion (<5%) of breast cancers in the
united states.60 this distinct clinicopathologic entity
is characterized by rapid onset of swelling, erythema,
and brawny edema of the breast, often with no clini2009

cally palpable breast mass.61 although not pathognomonic, dermal lymphatic invasion is frequently seen
on histology, and ibc frequently overexpresses her2.
phase i trials of lapatinib included 5 patients with
ibc, with 4 clinical responses.30,62
as a result, johnston et al52 conducted a phase ii
trial of monotherapy with lapatinib 1500 mg once
daily in patients with recurrent or anthracyclinerefractory ibc, not all of whom had received trastuzumab therapy. they also investigated molecular signatures potentially predictive of a response to lapatinib.
the 45 enrolled patients were grouped into 2 cohorts
based on her2 and egfr status (cohort a: her2+
and egfr+/–; cohort b: her2– and egfr+). fresh
tumor biopsies were obtained from all patients 7 days
after the initiation of lapatinib. fifteen of 30 patients
(50.0%) in cohort a had a clinical response, while
only 1 of 15 patients (6.7%) in cohort b had a clinical
response. tumor markers predictive of a response to
lapatinib in cohort a included phosphorylated  xxxg722xxx 
(pher3) expression (p = 0.021), pher2/pher3
coexpression (p = 0.005), and lack of p53 expression
(p = 0.033).
kaufman et al63 conducted an open-label phase ii
study of lapatinib 1500 mg once daily in 126 patients
with relapsed or refractory her2+ ibc. the overall
rr in this population was 39%, although no patients had a complete response. the median os was
11.2 months (95% ci, 9.1–13.5). patients who responded to lapatinib had a median os of 18.4 months
(95% ci, 12.8–26.4), whereas nonresponders to lapatinib had a median os of 8.4 months (95% ci, 5.9–
9.4). diarrhea was the most common adverse effect,
occurring in 59% of patients. other adverse effects
reported by ≥10% of patients were fatigue, nausea,
rash, anorexia, dyspnea, vomiting, and back pain.

indicators of efficacy in breast cancer
there have been reports that elevated her2 extracellular domain (ecd) concentrations predicted a poor
response to chemotherapy64 but a good response to
trastuzumab.65 work presented by gomez et al53 at
asco 2007 suggested a correlation between elevated levels of her2 mrna and the rr and ttp in
patients receiving first-line treatment with lapatinib.
further investigation is ongoing.

 xxxd425xxx  alone.20 serum samples were obtained at
baseline, at each efficacy assessment, and at withdrawal from the study. the samples were assessed for
levels of circulating ecds of egfr and her2. tumor
tissue, if available, was assessed for egfr, her by
ihc, and her2 by fish. on central fish analysis,
her2 amplification was found in 265 patients. these
patients had improved pfs with combination therapy
compared with  xxxd425xxx  monotherapy (hr =
0.471; 95% ci, 0.332–0.668; p < 0.001). for tumors
that were egfr 2+ or 3+ by ihc (14%), no association was found between the level of egfr expression
and pfs. the effect of lapatinib treatment was independent of baseline egfr or her2 ecd values. in
additional univariate analyses, no significant associations were found between pfs and visceral disease,
number of metastatic sites,  xxxg1603xxx  status,
or duration of previous trastuzumab treatment.

lapatinib in the adjuvant setting
the altto study (adjuvant lapatinib and/or
trastuzumab treatment optimization) was opened in
april 2007 and will evaluate the use of lapatinib in
the adjuvant setting. this international, randomized,
open-label, phase iii trial plans to enroll 8000 women
with her2+ breast cancer after surgical resection.
the intention is to compare the activity of lapatinib
alone, trastuzumab alone, trastuzumab followed by
lapatinib, and concomitant lapatinib and trastuzumab. neoadjuvant trials of lapatinib are also ongoing.
these may be of particular interest in light of data
presented at the 6th european breast cancer conference by chang et al,66 which suggested that unlike
chemotherapy, lapatinib decreased tumorigenic breast
cancer stem cells.

tolerability
lapatinib monotherapy is generally well tolerated.
the most common toxicities with lapatinib 1500 mg
once daily in the study by burstein et al51 were diarrhea, nausea, and rash; the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 10%, grade 3 nausea 3%, and grade 3 rash
<1%. toxicities were somewhat different in the phase ii
study of lapatinib monotherapy in ibc by johnston et
al,52 despite use of the same dose as in the study by
burstein et al; the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea was
11%, musculoskeletal pain 16%, and dyspnea 11%
(9% with pleural effusion, although there were no
grade 3/4 decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction
2009

[lvef]). in the study by lin et al58 in patients with
her2+ breast cancer and brain metastases, the effective dose was 750 mg bid. the most common grade 3
toxicities were diarrhea (21%), fatigue (15%), headache (10%), and increased transaminases (8%). grade
3 nausea and rash were noted in ≤5% of patients.
gomez et al53 noted no significant differences in toxicity between once- and twice-daily dosing. the most
common toxicities were diarrhea, rash, pruritus, and
nausea; grade 3 toxicity occurred in <5% of patients
overall.
as expected, more adverse events occurred with
combination therapy than with monotherapy, although
most toxicities were grade 1 or 2 (table v). rates of
discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events did
not differ significantly between the combinationtherapy and monotherapy arms in the phase ii study
by geyer et al20 (13% and 12%, respectively). minimal cardiac toxicity was seen, regardless of treatment
arm, despite patients having previously received anthracyclines (97% in combination-therapy arm) and
trastuzumab (96% in combination-therapy arm.)
five asymptomatic cardiac events were reported,
4 associated with combination therapy and 1 with
monotherapy.
cardiac toxicity has been reported with lapatinib,
although at a very low frequency. in the phase ii study
by burstein et al,51 only 1 patient had a grade 3 decrease in lvef, despite heavy pretreatment with anthracyclines and trastuzumab. lin et al58 reported no
symptomatic congestive heart failure, although 4 patients who had received a median of 2 previous
trastuzumab-containing chemotherapies had an asymptomatic decrease in lvef to <50%. treatment was
continued in at least 2 of these patients, with subsequent normalization of lvef.
cardiac toxicity with lapatinib also has been reported in patients with malignancies other than
breast cancer. such patients would not routinely receive anthracyclines or trastuzumab, and the data
suggested that lapatinib affected cardiac function
even in the absence of previous cardiotoxic treatment. in a phase ii trial in patients with adenocarcinomas of the salivary glands, agulnik et al67 found
that 2 patients (5%) developed asymptomatic lvef
decreases of ≥10%. safran et al50 reported that 2 patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers developed decreases in lvef of ≥20% while receiving lapatinib in
a phase i trial.

*calculated using the fisher exact test for differences in toxicities of any grade.

perez et al68 presented aggregate data for 2812 patients treated with lapatinib. lapatinib-associated decreases in lvef (national cancer institute common
terminology criteria for adverse events grade 3 or
≥20% decline from baseline) occurred with a frequency of 1.3%. the decreases in lvef were rarely
symptomatic and generally reversible with cessation
of therapy. the majority of events (68%) occurred
within 9 weeks of starting lapatinib therapy.
no formal recommendations have been made concerning surveillance for cardiac toxicity in association
with lapatinib therapy. moy and goss32 suggested following the standards contained in the consensus
guidelines for trastuzumab.69 however, decisions about
2344

the frequency with which cardiac function should be
assessed, whether therapy should be stopped in the
case of an asymptomatic decrease in lvef, and
whether treatment should be restarted after resolution
of a decrease in lvef should be based on individual
risk–benefit assessment. use of lapatinib in the setting
of an abnormal lvef remains controversial.

dosage and administration
lapatinib is indicated for use in combination with
 xxxd425xxx  in patients with her2+ metastatic breast
cancer who have already received an anthracycline, a
taxane, and trastuzumab.19 it is available as a 250-mg
tablet and should be administered once daily on an
volume 31 theme issue

a.j. tevaarwerk and j.m. kolesar
empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.
doses should not be divided. the usual dose of lapatinib is 1250 mg (5 tablets) once daily on days 1 to 21
of a repeating 21-day cycle in combination with oral
 xxxd425xxx  2000 mg/m2/d administered with food in
2 doses ~12 hours apart on days 1 to 14 of the cycle.
lapatinib tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or
split.19
lapatinib monotherapy is not associated with myelosuppression. however, because myelosuppression is
a well-known adverse effect of  xxxd425xxx , monitoring of the complete blood count should be performed
according to the treating physician’s judgment, and
both agents should be discontinued in the case of an
abnormality. in addition, patients should be monitored
for cardiac, pulmonary, and hepatic function, and appropriate dose modifications should be instituted if
toxicity is noted. to avoid drug interactions resulting in
reduced clinical activity or excessive toxicity, patients
should be advised to avoid drinking grapefruit juice
and to consult with their physician or pharmacist before starting new over-the-counter medications.19

cost considerations
the average wholesale price of lapatinib is $26.29 per
250-mg tablet. therefore, at the recommended dose of
1250 mg/d, the daily cost would be $131.46, or
$2761 for a 21-day/cycle.70 because lapatinib is currently indicated for use in combination with  xxxd425xxx , the cost of  xxxd425xxx  and other supportivecare agents needs to be taken into account to determine
the complete cost of the regimen.

future directions
current indications for lapatinib use are relatively
narrow, although additional uses are under investigation. lapatinib is being studied in various combinations in the setting of metastatic disease (eg, lapatinib
and paclitaxel, lapatinib and trastuzumab.) the recently opened altto study is examining the use of
lapatinib in the adjuvant setting.
initially, the clinical responses observed in a phase
iii comparison of lapatinib/paclitaxel and paclitaxel
in patients with her2– breast cancer71 led to some
confusion about the efficacy of lapatinib in her2–
disease. however, data presented by press et al72 at
asco 2008 indicated that on blinded reanalysis of
her2 status, these responders were actually her2+.
the current evidence suggests that the benefit of lapa2009

tinib is confined to her2+ disease, at least in metastatic breast cancer. it appears that overexpression of
egfr does not predict the efficacy of lapatinib, possibly because egfr may not be a good therapeutic
target in breast cancer, as evidenced by lack of efficacy
for single-agent cetuximab.73 it is not yet clear whether this view of lapatinib’s efficacy will hold true in the
adjuvant setting.
clinical trials of lapatinib in combination with other
medical therapies and in disease groups other than
breast cancer are ongoing. in addition, new erbbtargeted tk inhibitors such as  xxxd421xxx , which targets
egfr, her2, and  xxxg723xxx ,74 are in early stages of
clinical testing.

conclusions
lapatinib is a small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of
both the egfr and her2 tks that is approved for
use in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the treatment
of patients with advanced her2+ breast cancer that
has progressed after trastuzumab therapy. lapatinib
monotherapy appears to be well tolerated, although
the rr in advanced breast cancer was low. lapatinib
used in combination with  xxxd425xxx  was associated
with significant improvements in rr and ttp.
