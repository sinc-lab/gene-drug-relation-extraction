il-2 is a cytokine that functions as a growth factor and central
regulator in the immune system and mediates its effects through
ligand-induced hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits  xxxg1174xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and ␥c. here, we describe the crystal structure of the
trimeric assembly of the human  xxxg1175xxx  ectodomains in
complex with il-2 at 3.0 å resolution. the quaternary structure is
consistent with a stepwise assembly from il-2兾il-2r␣ to il-2兾il2r␣兾il-2r␤ to il-2兾il-2r␣兾il-2r␤兾␥c. the  xxxg1175xxx ␣ subunit forms the
largest of the three il-2兾il-2r interfaces, which, together with the
high abundance of charge– charge interactions, correlates well
with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of
 xxxg1175xxx ␣ with il-2 at the cell surface. surprisingly,  xxxg1175xxx ␣ makes no
contacts with  xxxg1175xxx ␤ or ␥c, and only minor changes are observed in
the il-2 structure in response to receptor binding. these findings
support the principal role of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ to deliver il-2 to the signaling
complex and act as regulator of signal transduction. cooperativity
in assembly of the final quaternary complex is easily explained by
the extraordinarily extensive set of interfaces found within the
fully assembled il-2 signaling complex, which nearly span the
entire length of the  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c subunits. helix a of il-2 wedges
tightly between  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c to form a three-way junction that
coalesces into a composite binding site for the final ␥c recruitment.
the il-2兾␥c interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and
the fewest hydrogen bonds in the complex, which is consistent
with its promiscuous use in other cytokine receptor complexes.

n 1976, lymphocyte-conditioned medium was found to support
the long-term growth of t lymphocytes (t cells) (1), but the
active component was not characterized as a variably glycosylated 15.5-kda protein until 1981 (2). subsequently, il-2 was
purified to homogeneity (3), and its cdna was cloned in 1983
(4). the discovery of il-2 permitted the creation of monoclonal
t cells (5), which were instrumental in the characterization of
many aspects of t cell biology. il-2 is the primary cytokine
responsible for the rapid expansion, differentiation, and survival
of antigen-selected t cell clones during an immune response, but
is also important for b cell, natural killer (nk) cell (6), and
regulatory t cell (treg) (7) function.
il-2 was the first cytokine found to mediate its effects via a cell
surface binding site with all of the characteristics of classic
hormone receptors, including high affinity, stereospecifity, and
saturability (8). kinetic binding studies revealed that the high
affinity binding (kd ⬇ 10 pm) to the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ) is due
to a rapid rate of association (kon ⬇ 107 m⫺1䡠s⫺1), but relatively
slow dissociation rate (koff ⬇ 10⫺4 s⫺1) (9). the high-affinity
 xxxg1175xxx  comprises three separate, noncovalently linked chains,
termed ␣ ( xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxd924xxx , cd25) (10), ␤ ( xxxg1175xxx ␤, p75,  xxxg1175xxx )
(11, 12), and ␥ (␥c,  xxxg1175xxx ␥, p65,  xxxg1176xxx ) (13), the latter being
a common receptor component for many cytokines, including
il-4,  xxxg1183xxx , il-9, il-15, and il-2 (14).  xxxg1175xxx ␣ contributes the
rapid association rate of il-2 binding, whereas  xxxg1175xxx ␤ is responsible for its slow dissociation rate (9).

a critical number of il-2rs must be triggered before an individual t cell will make the irrevocable, quantal (all-or-none)
decision to pass through the g1 restriction point so as to undergo
dna replication and subsequent mitosis (15, 16). however, exactly
how the cell senses this threshold of triggered il-2rs has remained
obscure. a clue to this issue may then reside in the structure–
activity relationship (sar) of the il-2兾il-2r interaction.
here, we present the crystal structure of the fully assembled,
human  xxxg1175xxx  ectodomains in complex with its ligand at
3.0 å resolution. the molecular architecture of this heterotrimeric receptor can now be analyzed to decipher the assembly,
signaling, and disassembly mechanisms of this enigmatic cytokine receptor complex, and provide insights into the cooperativity of high-affinity binding, as well as the promiscuous use of
␥c in other cytokine receptor complexes.
results
assembly of the quaternary il-2 signaling complex. the high-

affinity complex of il-2 with its extracellular  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤,
and ␥c receptor domains was assembled from the individual
receptor ectodomains expressed in insect cells. throughout
purification of ␥c, this receptor subunit existed as a stable
homotrimer, as determined by gel filtration. when incubated at
37°c in the presence of  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and il-2, the ␥c trimer
could dissociate and incorporate into the stable quaternary il-2
signaling complex. however, upon chemical deglycosylation, ␥c
aggregated and could not be dissociated for engagement in the
high-affinity complex. thus, self interaction through trimerization and surface carbohydrate sites on ␥c may serve an important
solubility role, masking epitopes for il-2 and  xxxg1175xxx ␤ recognition until formation of a productive signaling complex.
structure determination of the quaternary il-2 signaling complex.

the 3.0-å crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement by using the coordinates from an independently
assembled il-2兾il-2r complex (17), in which mutations at
asn-17␤gln and asn-45␤gln eliminated two glycosylation sites
and which crystallized in a different space group (c2). a brief
comparison of the il-2兾il-2r complexes in the triclinic (here)
and the monoclinic crystal form (17) is presented in supporting
materials and methods, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site. the x-ray structure was refined to
rfree and rcryst of 26% and 22%, respectively (table 2, which is
published as supporting information on the pnas web site). two
independent complexes in the asymmetric unit offered a valuconflict of interest statement: no conflicts declared.

fig. 2. interface between  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and il-2. open-book representation of the il-2兾il-2r␣ interface. the electrostatic potential was mapped onto the molecular
surface and contoured at ⫾35kt兾ev (blue兾red). the interface features a hydrophobic center, flanked by a large number of salt bridges and other polar contacts.
the strong electrostatic component of this interaction serves to rapidly capture il-2 and, thus, to dominate the kon rate of il-2 binding to the  xxxg1175xxx .

mainly with the long connection between helices a and b that
include helices a⬘ and b⬘ of il-2, in a region recently termed
‘‘site iv’’ (19).  xxxg1175xxx ␣ surprisingly does not contact  xxxg1175xxx ␤ or
␥c, and the three interaction sites on il-2 generally do not
overlap with each other, except for a small, but significant, region
(see below). the il-2 molecule in this quaternary complex
undergoes only minimal conformational changes, the most significant of which is the ordering of the bc loop (residues 74–81)
due to crystal-packing interactions. the  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c constructs terminate just 6 and 7 residues from the transmembrane
domains, respectively (20). thus, we can estimate the distance
from the observed c terminus (gly-165␣) of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ to the
membrane to be ⬇40 å, consistent with the predicted unstructured 54-residue linker between gly-165␣ and the putative
transmembrane domain (20).
structure of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and its interface with il-2.  xxxg1175xxx ␣ folds into two
‘‘sushi-like’’ domains d1 and d2, which form five-stranded
␤-sheet sandwiches. these domains are disposed at ⬇75° to each
other, as in the crystal structure of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ complexed with il-2
(19). d1 accounts for the majority (82%) of the total buried
surface area (1,590 å2) between  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and il-2, whereas d2
contributes only to a minor extent. the nature of the il-2兾il2r␣ interface reveals a striking dichotomy of a hydrophobic
center dominated by  xxxg1175xxx ␣ residues leu-2␣, met-25␣, leu-42␣,
and tyr-43␣ and il-2 residues phe-42il-2, phe-44il-2, tyr-45il-2,
pro-65il-2, and leu-72il-2, and a polar periphery featuring five
ion pairs (lys-38␣兾glu-61il-2, arg-36␣兾glu-62il-2, glu-1␣兾lys35il-2, asp-6␣兾arg-38il-2, and glu-29␣兾lys-43il-2; fig. 2). seven
hydrogen bonds are formed between il-2 and  xxxg1175xxx ␣ (table 3,
which is published as supporting information on the pnas web
site). no significant differences in side- and main-chain conformations are observed at the core of the il-2兾il-2r␣ interface,
but some variation in total buried surface area and shape
correlation sc in the two complexes (0.71 and 0.64, by using a
1.7-å probe) is noted (table 1). a slight rigid-body rotation (10°)
of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ with respect to il-2 seems to result from different
crystal packing environments that would give rise to the slight
variations in shape complementarity and buried surface.
architecture of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c. the ectodomains of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c

possess a cytokine-binding homology region, which is divided in
two fibronectin type-iii (fn-iii) domains termed d1 and d2.
each domain contains seven ␤-strands that form a sandwich of
two antiparallel ␤-sheets. the n-terminal d1 domains of  xxxg1175xxx ␤

and ␥c both conform to the hybrid type of the ig fold (21) where
the c⬘ strand hydrogen bonds with both faces of the ␤-sandwich
(fig. 1), similar to  xxxg718xxx  (epor) (22). in
contrast, the d2 domains belong to the switched type of ig folds,
where strand c⬘ hydrogen bonds only with strand c. domain d1
(residues 6–99) and d2 (103–209) of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ are disposed at an
elbow angle of 73°, characteristic of class i cytokine receptors
(ghr, 64°; il-4r, 82°; epor, 62° and 77°), whereas in ␥c the
elbow angles between d1 (32–125) and d2 (129–226) increases
to 92° and 98°, respectively, more typical of class ii cytokine
receptors (il-10r1, 93°; ifn-␣r2, 100°;  xxxg748xxx , 118°) (23).
the distinct elbow angle in ␥c is also accompanied by a more
extended interdomain region. finally, the d1 and d2 linker
regions of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (residues 100–102) and ␥c (126–128) both
adopt a 310 helical conformation.
a common feature of class i cytokine receptor domains
includes two highly conserved disulfide bridges in d1 that link
strands a to b, and strands c⬘ to e, as in  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c.  xxxg1175xxx ␤
d1 contains an additional disulfide between strands c and f
(cys-33␤-cys-84␤). d2 of ␥c exhibits another unique disulfide
that connects loops bc2 and fg2 (cys-160␥-cys-209␥) and
significantly contributes to the interface with il-2 (fig. 4). in d2
of both  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c, a tryptophan-arginine ladder on sheet
c⬘-c-f-g, that contains the highly conserved wsxws motif, is
present, as in other cytokine receptors (18, 24).
in  xxxg1175xxx ␤, a particularly well defined glycan structure, consisting
of four sugars n-linked to asn-17, is wedged between d1 and d2
(fig. 1 a and fig. 6, which is published as supporting information
on the pnas web site). the ␣1,6-linked core fucose forms four
hydrogen bonds with arg-105␤ and leu-106␤ of d2. moreover, the
four sugars make numerous van der waals contacts with d1 and
d2, which may help stabilize a precise orientation of the respective
fibronectin type-iii domains to each other.
interface between  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and il-2. il-2 forms the second largest

interface with  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (1,150 å2, table 1) with good shape
complementarity (0.68) and high specificity via 10 hydrogen
bonds (table 3). recognition of il-2 by  xxxg1175xxx ␤ is dominated by
the central, protruding tyr-134␤, which contributes 17% of the
buried surface area on  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (fig. 3). for il-2, asp-20il2 and
his-16il2 seem to be the most critical residues; asp-20il2 hydrogen bonds to his-133␤ and tyr-134␤, whereas his-16il2 is
tucked into a slot created by tyr-134␤, gln-188␤, and the methyl
groups of thr-74␤ and thr-73␤. major van der waals contacts in
stauber et al.

the interface are also made with arg-41␤, val-75␤, his-133␤,
leu-19il2, asp-84il2, asn-88il2, and val-91il2.
interface between ␥c and il-2. the ␥c兾il-2 interaction (970 å2) is

the smallest of the three il-2兾il-2r interfaces, although with
good surface complementarity (0.72). furthermore, this contact
surface features only two hydrogen bonds (table 3) and weak
electrostatic interactions (fig. 4), indicating low specificity. the
contribution of main-chain atoms to the buried surface area is
intermediate (17% on average) between those of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ (21%)
and  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (12%) (table 1). tyr-103␥, his-159␥, and leu-208␥
together with the disulfide (cys-160␥-cys-209␥) contribute 53%
of the buried surface on ␥c and represent the major binding
determinant. the importance of the disulfide bridge was previously appreciated from mutagenesis data (25, 26), but its direct
involvement in ligand binding was unexpected. with a buried
surface area of 72 å2 and one hydrogen bond, gln-126il2 is the
most critical il-2 residue that contacts ␥c in accordance with
biochemical data (27). glu-15il2, thr-123il2, and ile-129il2
contribute other significant interactions to the il-2兾␥c interface.
interface between  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c. in stark contrast to the relatively

small il-2兾␥c interface, the  xxxg1175xxx  structure reveals a surprisingly
large and specific interaction between the  xxxg656xxx  domains of
 xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c (1,640 å2). the predominantly polar contacts are
evenly distributed among the 22 residues of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and 31 residues
of ␥c without any obvious hot-spot residues. the low percentage of
aromatic residues among the side-chain contributions (12%), in
combination with 14 hydrogen bonds, seems to enforce much
higher specificity of ␥c with  xxxg1175xxx ␤ than of ␥c to il-2. glu-136␤ and
stauber et al.

fig. 4. interface of ␥c with il-2 and  xxxg1175xxx ␤. this ␥c interface (green兾red) with
il-2 (yellow兾red) is characterized by the smallest total buried surface area and
formation of only two hydrogen bonds. strikingly, the elbow region of ␥c
engages only partially with il-2. furthermore, ␥c exhibits a large elbow angle,
which is atypical of class-i cytokine receptors. these structural properties are
likely to contribute to promiscuity of this receptor subunit. the large contact
area with  xxxg1175xxx ␤ is colored brown and includes three residues (red) which also
interact with il-2 (red residues).

his-138␤ form the hinge of the d1兾d2  xxxg1175xxx ␤ elbow and significantly interact with both il-2 and ␥c. similarly, tyr-182␥, pro-207␥,
and leu-208␥ form the hinge of the d1兾d2 ␥c elbow and interact
with both il-2 and  xxxg1175xxx ␤.
interface between  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and ␥c: crystal artifact or physiologically
relevant. a crystal contact of considerable size and specificity is

formed between ␥c and a symmetry-related  xxxg1175xxx ␣ molecule in the
neighboring unit cell. remarkably, this interaction is observed in
both copies of the asymmetric unit, as well as in another crystal
form (17).  xxxg1175xxx ␣ d2 strands h, i, and j interact with the surface
of the ␥c elbow region that is not involved in il-2 binding. structural
features include high shape complementarity (0.68 and 0.78,
respectively), a large buried surface area (1,150 å2) and nine
interdomain hydrogen bonds. in this arrangement, the d2 domains
of  xxxg1175xxx ␤兾␥c are parallel to each other, with their c termini toward
the membrane (fig. 7, which is published as supporting information
on the pnas web site). such lateral interactions would lead to
one-dimensional lattices of  xxxg1175xxx  complexes on the cell surface that
could promote higher-order signaling assemblies, although no
measurable affinity between soluble  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and ␥c has been
detected (28). however, this same set of experiments also did not
detect any binding between  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c, which in fact form an
extensive interface in the fully assembled  xxxg1175xxx .

fig. 3. interface of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ with il-2 and ␥c. the interface of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (cyan兾red)
and il-2 (yellow兾red) is intermediate in buried surface area among the three
il-2兾il-2r interfaces. asp-20 and his-16 of il-2 are located at the center of the
binding region and are involved in many van der waals contacts and hydrogen
bonds. the interface features the highest number of hydrogen bonds, consistent with its high specificity and low koff rate of il-2 dissociation. the large
contact area with ␥c is colored brown and includes two residues (red) that also
interact with il-2 (red residues).

have long been recognized to consist of two tandem fibronectin
type-iii domains that contain sequence signature motifs as in
other cytokine receptors (13, 29). as expected, a dali search
(30) identified other cytokine receptors, such as il-4r (z-score
of 17.3, rms deviation (rmsd) of 2.4 å over 176 residues) and
 xxxg718xxx  (16.5, 3.4 å over 182 residues) as the
closest structural homologs of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and ␥c. however, the
crystal structure of the complete il-2兾il-2r complex now
enables analysis of the organization of the quaternary assembly
and the nature and extent of each of the il-2兾il-2r interfaces
and receptor subunit interactions, as well as the role of the
individual receptor subunits in the high-affinity complex assembly and signal transduction.
the precise role of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ has so far remained elusive. this
receptor subunit, together with  xxxg1175xxx ␤, can form a pseudohigh-affinity site for il-2 on the cell surface (kd ⬇ 300 pm), yet
 xxxg1175xxx ␤ itself binds il-2 only with modest affinity (kd ⬇ 450 nm)
(31). in contrast, a soluble form of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ comprising solely its
ectodomain exhibits comparable il-2 affinity (kd ⬇ 144 nm) to
its membrane-bound form, but only ⬇2-fold increased affinity
(kd ⬇ 64 nm) upon addition of soluble  xxxg1175xxx ␣ (28). minor
changes observed in the il-2 structure in response to  xxxg1175xxx ␣
binding are probably sufficient to explain the 2-fold increase in
 xxxg1175xxx ␤ affinity for il-2 in solution. however, because  xxxg1175xxx ␣
does not make any interactions with  xxxg1175xxx ␤, the massive difference in the kd of il-2 with membrane-anchored  xxxg1175xxx ␤ in the
presence or absence of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ suggests that this subunit primarily serves as a ligand carrier. for potent cell signaling,
secreted il-2 must be captured at the cell surface to minimize
its loss by diffusion away from the cell. the high affinity of
 xxxg1175xxx ␣ for il-2 and the large excess of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ over  xxxg1175xxx ␤
and  xxxg1175xxx ␥ on activated t cells facilitate this capture and
delivery to  xxxg1175xxx ␤ or to any  xxxg1175xxx ␤兾␥c complex through
two-dimensional cell surface diffusion. computational modeling
suggests that a stepwise assembly mechanism leads to a greater
number of high-affinity signaling complexes than signaling via a
preformed, fully assembled  xxxg1175xxx , considering the thermodynamics, kinetics, receptor density, and cell density of the il-2兾t
cell system (32). alternatively, cooperativity in formation of the
ternary il-2兾il-2r␣兾il-2r␤ complex may result from a preformed  xxxg1175xxx ␣兾il-2r␤ complex on the cell surface, which
would then undergo large-scale conformational rearrangements
upon assembly to higher-order il-2 signaling complexes. isothermal titration calorimetry (itc) experiments (28) have, in
fact, measured significant affinity for this heterodimer (kd ⬇ 280
nm), but the structure of the quaternary il-2 complex is difficult
to reconcile with this finding.
the preponderance of charge–charge interactions at the
il-2兾il-2r␣ interface may serve to dominate the kinetics of
il-2 recruitment by its receptor. long-range electrostatic interactions are known to accelerate the association rate kon, whereas
short range interactions govern the dissociation rate koff (33).
the rapid rate of il-2 association with  xxxg1175xxx ␣ (9) is then
consistent with strong electrostatic interactions and high electrostatic complementarity, whereas the slow dissociation rate
ascribed to  xxxg1175xxx ␤ (9) correlates well with the properties of the
il-2兾il-2r␤ interface (table 1).
thus, the  xxxg1175xxx ␣兾il-2 complex is likely to be preferentially
delivered to  xxxg1175xxx ␤, forming the pseudo-high-affinity complex, in
agreement with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (28).
this complex then recruits ␥c, possibly from ␥c trimers, burying a
large surface area between the receptor subunits (table 1) and
forming a tight three-way junction comprising  xxxg1175xxx ␤, ␥c, and il-2.
consistent with the lowest kd value measured for a single step in
 xxxg1175xxx  assembly (28), association of ␥c with il-2兾il-2␤ constitutes
the ultimate thermodynamic driving force toward the assembly of
the il-2 signaling complex. on activated t cells, il-2兾il-2␤ would
be part of the ternary il-2兾il-2r␣兾il-2␤ complex whereas, on

fig. 5. three-way junction between il-2,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and ␥c. il-2 (yellow ribbon
representation),  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and ␥c (the surfaces are colored as in figs. 3 and 4)
form a three-way junction at the heart of the high-affinity il-2 signaling
complex. the network of residues that mediate these contacts (colored red)
provides a compelling structural basis for cooperativity in the il-2兾il-2r
complex assembly.

certain natural killer cells and monocytes, il-2兾il-2␤ would not be
associated with  xxxg1175xxx ␣ due to the lack of this receptor subunit on
these cells (9). intriguingly, the buried surface areas of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and
of ␥c that are involved in receptor兾receptor and receptor兾il-2
contacts nearly span the entire length of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and of ␥c. because
the buried surface areas of  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and of ␥c that are involved in
receptor兾receptor and receptor兾il-2 contacts overlap somewhat
(figs. 3 and 4), we propose that il-2 binding to  xxxg1175xxx ␤ may induce
conformational changes in the contiguous ␥c contact area of
 xxxg1175xxx ␤, which primes the il-2兾il-2r␣兾il-2r␤ and the il-2兾il2r␤ complex, respectively, for ␥c recruitment. the il-2-dependent
 xxxg1175xxx ␤兾␥c association is further enhanced by three ␥c residues
(tyr-182␥, pro-207␥, and l208␥), which interface with both il-2 and
 xxxg1175xxx ␤, two  xxxg1175xxx ␤ residues (glu-136␤ and his-138␤) which are
correspondingly buried in il-2兾␥c interface, and by three il-2
residues (leuil12, glu-15il2, and leu-19il2), which interface with
both receptor subunits (fig. 5). this cooperative mechanism could
then account for the nondetectable affinities (⬍50 ␮m) of  xxxg1175xxx ␤
to ␥c in the absence of il-2, and il-2 to ␥c (28), and would also
provide an essential safety mechanism against premature signaling
via the  xxxg1175xxx ␤兾␥c dimer in the absence of ligand. collectively, the
three-way junction between il-2,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and ␥c provides a compelling structural basis for cooperativity in il-2兾il-2r complex
assembly initiated by, and therefore dependent on, il-2 or il-2兾
 xxxg1175xxx ␣.
the structural features of the il-2兾␥c interface provide a
plausible mechanism of how the common ␥ chain ␥c is capable
of binding to six different cytokines (34). first, the il-2兾␥c
interface is characterized by the smallest buried surface area,
and only a portion of the d1兾d2 junction of ␥c actually contacts
il-2 (fig. 4). second, the relatively large elbow angle between
d1 and d2 of ␥c with respect to other cytokine class i receptors
increases the prospective ligand-binding surface in the interdomain region. most strikingly, little specificity is conferred upon
the il-2兾␥c interface due to the formation of only 2 hydrogen
bonds, as opposed to 7 and 10 in the other two il-2兾il-2r
interfaces. our structural results also agree well with extensive
mutagenesis work on defining the epitopes on ␥c for various
cytokines (25, 26, 35). tyr-103␥, cys-160␥, and cys-209␥, identified as hot-spot residues in all of the cytokine兾␥c interfaces,
form a hydrophobic patch in the center of the il-2兾␥c interface.
because certain residues located around this hot spot were
stauber et al.

exclusively implicated in il-4 binding (ile-100␥ and leu-102␥) or
il-21 binding (asn-44␥, leu-161␥, glu-162␥), a general model
for degenerate cytokine recognition by ␥c was proposed in which
the various binding sites were largely overlapping, but not
identical (26, 35). the lack of effect on cytokine binding of
mutations involving lys-97␥, phe-156␥, leu-157␥, asn-159␥, or
his-184␥ also revealed that this portion of the interdomain
region, which in the x-ray structure does not contact il-2 but
 xxxg1175xxx ␣ of an adjacent complex in the crystal (see results), does
not seem to be involved in binding to other cytokines. given the
relatively small nature and the low specificity of the il-2兾␥c
interface that must largely overlap with other cytokine兾␥c interfaces, the ␥c specificity in the  xxxg1175xxx  complex must then arise
from specific interactions of ␥c with  xxxg1175xxx ␤. whether the
combination of a relatively specific receptor兾receptor interaction, but relatively nonspecific receptor兾cytokine interaction,
also holds for other signaling complexes involving ␥c remains an
essential, but unanswered, question. in summary, the composite
␥c-binding site on the binary (il-2兾il-2r␤) or tertiary (il-2兾
 xxxg1175xxx ␣兾il-2r␤) complex serves both cooperativity and specificity purposes in the assembly of the high-affinity il-2 signaling
complex.
upon activation, the high-affinity receptor undergoes rapid
endocytosis and subsequent dissociation in the endosome (36). the
prevalence of strong electrostatic interactions within the il-2兾il2r␣ interface (fig. 2) also provides an excellent structural solution
for promoting the dissociation of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ from the quaternary il-2
signaling complex at the lower ph within endosomes.  xxxg1175xxx ␣ can
recycle back to the plasma membrane whereas il-2,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and
␥c undergo degradation. it is noteworthy that the x-ray structures
presented here as well as elsewhere (17) were both determined at
acidic ph (5.1 and 6.1, respectively). the determined assemblies
may, therefore, be more representative of the structure as it occurs
in the endosome, where it is poised for  xxxg1175xxx ␣ disengagement.
engineered il-2 mutants with significantly increased affinity for
 xxxg1175xxx ␣ increase the potency and persistence of il-2, possibly by
preventing dissociation of il-2 from  xxxg1175xxx ␣ in the endosome and

causing an il-2兾il-2r␣ complex to be recycled to the cell surface
(37). this mechanism could account for the differential signaling
responses for il-2 versus il-15, despite their shared receptor
( xxxg1175xxx ␤兾␥c), because each ligand binds a unique ␣ chain with very
different affinities [kd ⬇ 10 nm and kd ⬇ 10 pm (membranebound), respectively] (38), and each receptor complex exhibits a
distinct pattern of persistence on the cell surface (39), further
supporting the role of  xxxg1175xxx ␣ as a regulatory ligand carrier.
in conclusion, the crystal structure of the human il-2 signaling complex has given us the opportunity to address key residual
issues on  xxxg1175xxx  assembly, the specific role of the  xxxg1175xxx ␣ chain
in modulating the signaling response, and the ability of ␥c to act
as a component of a variety of additional receptors, as well as to
suggest lateral assembly of receptor complexes on the cell
surface that could enhance signal propagation.

materials and methods
for details on expression, purification, complex formation,
crystallization, and structure determination, see supporting materials and methods. in brief, the ectodomains of the human il-2
receptor chains  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, and ␥c were individually cloned
and expressed in insect cells. recombinant human il-2 was
kindly provided by amgen as a gift to k.a.s. the high-affinity
 xxxg1175xxx  ligand complex was reconstituted from the individual protein chains by incubation at 37°c and purified by gel
filtration. the il-2兾il-2r complex crystallized in triclinic space
group p1. the crystal structure was determined to 3.0 å
resolution by molecular replacement by using the coordinates
from an independently assembled il-2兾il-2r complex (17).
data processing and final refinement statistics are shown in
