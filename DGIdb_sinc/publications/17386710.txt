abstract
17␤-boldenone (17␤-bold) and boldione (add) are steroid compounds with androgenic activity, likely to be used as growth promoters in
cattle. different studies still on-going aiming to distinguish between “natural” occurrence or illegal bold source had already indicated that their
metabolism in cattle is of relevant significance. to identify metabolites as in vivo markers to support the thesis of exogenous administration, a
further approach to the in vitro biotransformation of 17␤-bold and add was performed using different subcellular fractions obtained from
both liver and kidney of untreated cattle. polar and non-polar metabolites obtained from incubated parent compounds were formerly separated
by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) elution and successively identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(lc–ms/ms) detection.
the bovine liver was the target tissue of the main metabolic reaction transforming 17␤-bold to add and vice versa. the presence of
6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold, produced from both compounds when nadph was added as cofactors to liver post mitochondrial and microsomal
fractions suggests that cytochrome p450-dependent enzymes could be involved in the biotransformation, as it occurs for 6␤-hydroxylation of
17␤-testosterone. the results indicated that the urinary excretion profile in vivo of 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold and 16␣-hydroxy-17␤-bold could
be studied together with 17␣- and 17␤-bold as putative markers of bold treatment in cattle.

1. introduction
17␤-boldenone (17␤-bold), namely androsta-1,4-diene17␤-ol-3-one, is a steroid with androgenic activity that differs
from 17␤-testosterone by only one double bond at the 1position [1]. 17␤-bold and its esters are illegally used as
muscle and performance enhancers in race horses, in athletes
and bodybuilders, and in cattle to improve animal growth and
feed conversion [2,3]. other steroids closely related to the parent compound, 17␤-bold, are the dione form boldione or
androsta-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  (add), often used per os as precursor because of its fast and good absorption and the inactive

form of 17␤-bold, 17␣-boldenone or androsta-1,4-dien-17␣ol-3-one (17␣-bold).
to avoid consumer to unforeseeable risks from the intake of
hormone residues and their metabolites the presence of bold
residues is forbidden in animals and their products under directives 96/22/ce [4]. in 2005, 17␤-bold has been included in the
world anti-doping agency (wada) list of banned substances
and iarc has classified 17␤-bold as a probable human carcinogen [5]. moreover 17␣-bold, has been shown to play a role
in the development of human prostate carcinomas implanted in
mice [6].
in an expert report, recently written on the presence of 17␤bold and metabolites in food producing species, it is still
subject of a debate its endogenous or exogenous origin when
detected in faecal or urine samples [1]. it is reported that 17␤bold is present in the testis and the urine of entire untreated

male pig and horses [7,8]. 17␣-bold was the main in vivo
metabolite found in urine from untreated cattle and the ␣-epimer
alone, did not provide evidence of illegal treatment [9,10,11].
following the administration of 17␤-bold to one calf and
one cow, 17␣-bold, 17␤-bold, add and several hydroxylated metabolites were detected in urine [12]. in cattle, as in
humans, add could be considered both a metabolite and a
precursor of 17␤-bold, indeed the enzymatic action of 17␤hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, rapidly converted add into
17␤-bold [11,13]. the oxidation of 17␤-bold to add was
the most prominent in vitro metabolite in liver microsomes,
while in isolated hepatocytes 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold and 6␤hydroxy-add were identified, as reported by van puymbroeck
et al. [12].
barthakur et al. showed in their study that a few microorganisms, i.e. mycobacterium spp. can transform several
phytosterols, as ␤-sitosterol, to add [14]; poelmans et al.
reported the possible formation of 17␤-bold from phytosterols
present in vegetable fat, using an invertebrate like neomysis
integer as an alternative model for the study of the in vitro
metabolism [15]. thus the origin of bold in cattle urine could
be related to a dietary intake of phytosterols transformed formerly into add and then into 17␤- and 17␣-bold. these
data and the interspecies variation reported above, indicates
the importance to study the biotransformation of 17␤-bold
and add in cattle, using in vitro liver and kidney subcellular
fractions to identify other urinary markers of treatment in cattle.

lobe and kidney lobules, were collected at the slaughter house
immediately after the animal sacrifice and put into ice-cold
1.15% kcl solution.
homogenate was prepared from approximately 10 g samples
using a potter apparatus with a teflon pestle (alc heavy stirrer)
in ice-cold 10 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.6) containing 0.25 m
sucrose, 0.1 mm edta and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min
at 4 ◦ c. the supernatant was stored in liquid nitrogen as the
homogenate with mitochondrial fraction (h).
post-mitochondrial (s9), microsomal (mic) and cytosolic
fractions (c) were obtained directly from homogenised tissue in
ice-cold 0.1 m phosphate buffer ph 7.4 and 1.15% (w/v) kcl
solution (1:1; v:v), centrifuged at 9000 × g at 4 ◦ c for 20 min.
aliquots of supernatant, s9 fraction, were collected (stored in
liquid nitrogen) or centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4 ◦ c
to obtain mic and c. the microsomal pellet was suspended in
0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and stored in liquid nitrogen.

2.4. hplc analysis
the hplc apparatus consisted of a jasco pump pu-980
equipped with an lg 980-02 ternary gradient unit, a gastorr gt-103 degaser, a jasco autosampler as 950 and a jasco
uv-975 uv/vis detector (japan spectroscopic) set at 247 nm.
the column was a synergi fusion-rp 80 (150 mm × 4.6 mm,
4 ␮m) and elution was performed using water (a) and acetonitrile (b) at the following linear gradient condition for a run time
of 60 min: the solvent b was kept at 20% for 9 min, risen to 40%
in 42 min, then returned to 20% in 5 min. injection volume was
10 ␮l.

2.5. lc–ms/ms analysis
the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (lc–ms/
ms) system consisted of a waters (milford, ma, usa) model
alliance 2695 lc system equipped with a quattro ultima ii
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer from micromass (manchester, uk), equipped with electrospray ionisation (esi) ion
source, operating in positive ion mode. the analysis was performed using multiple reaction monitoring mode (mrm). for
each analyte, the two most abundant product ions were monitored using the conditions given in table 1. the analytical
column was a 2.1 mm × 100 mm i.d. 3.5 ␮m c18 waters, set
at 30 ◦ c. the mobile phases used consisted of two solutions:
(a) water/ xxxd2154xxx  (100:0.2; v/v) and (b) acetonitrile/formic
acid (100:0.2; v/v). following a 3 min isocratic period at 20%
b, a linear gradient was started reaching 45% b at 18.5 min.
injection volume was 10 ␮l.

the gradient elution efficiently separated three unknown polar
compounds (eluting respectively at 14.06 ± 2.14, 16.48 ± 2.57
and 18.90 ± 2.63 min), and add (41.91 ± 0.98 min) as in s9
and mic; 17␣-bold was not detected. when add and
nadph generating systems were incubated with liver h,
s9 and mic, one main polar compound metabolite (eluting
at 19.97 ± 1.8 min) and 17␤-bold (34.92 ± 1.61 min), were
recorded with several minor peaks (fig. 2).

main metabolites produced after the in vitro incubation of 17␤-bold 25 ␮m, performed in triplicate with h, s9, mic and c from three calves livers (l) and three
bulls kidneys (k) with nadph generating system, nad or nadh as cofactors. data (mean values ± standard deviation) from lc–ms/ms analyses are expressed
as nmol min−1 mg protein−1 .

3.2. hplc elution of nad and nadh incubations
hplc analyses of the extracted liver c incubations, with
nad and nadh added as cofactors, checked only the transformation of 17␤-bold to add and of add into 17␤-bold,
respectively.
3.3. lc–ms/ms identiﬁcation
the identification of the mixture components was achieved
in two steps: first by revealing the molecular weight of the protonated forms of the main metabolites by full scan experiments,
second by collecting information on their molecular structures
by ms/ms experiments. the confirmation of the identity of the
main compounds was achieved by comparison with the corresponding commercially analytical standards (where available).

table 1 reported retention times, typical precursor and product ions and ms/ms conditions. table 2 reported precursor
and most abundant product ions of recovered metabolites.
tables 3 and 4 summarized the formation of polar and non polar
metabolites, from 17␤-bold and add, the cellular compartment and cofactor used in liver and kidney assays.
the lc–ms/ms analyses of the incubation extracts of 17␤bold with h, s9 and mic and nadph generating system,
confirmed add and the three polar hydroxylated (m/z 303)
derivatives of 17␤-bold. two out of three metabolites eluting
at 4.07 ± 0.07and 6.23 ± 0.37 min, respectively, were confirmed
as 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold and as 16␣-hydroxy-17␤-bold
(fig. 3). the third polar metabolite was not fully identified as its
daughter ions and the retention time did not perfectly match
any of the standards purchased (table 2). no production of
17␣-bold was measured.

metabolites produced from in the incubation of liver s9 with nadph generating
system.

when 17␤-bold was incubated with liver c and nad as
cofactor, add was the only final metabolite identified, and
no 17␣-bold or other polar metabolites were produced. the
amount of add produced was by far greatly than that occurring
in s9 and mic incubation.
in c and mic from bovine kidney the production of a
small amount of add was detected; 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold,
at negligible amount, was recorded only in mic incubations;
the production of 17␣-bold, as in liver fractions, was never
detected (table 3).
when add and nadph as cofactor were incubated with
liver h, s9 and mic (table 4 and fig. 4a), lc–ms/ms analysis showed 17␤-bold (m/z 287 eluting at 12.84 ± 0.04 min)
as main metabolite, another one with m/z 301 eluting at
6.7 ± 0.05 min, that was putatively identified as an addhydroxyl derivative by ms/ms fragmentation and full scan
experiments (fig. 4b). the 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold (m/z 303,
eluting at 4.08 ± 0.07 min) was formed in liver s9, h and mic
fractions, but not in c.
when add and nadh were incubated with c, 17␤-bold
was produced together with a compound with m/z 287 eluting
at 15.11 ± 0.03 min, then identified as 17␣-bold.
add reduction into 17␤-bold was recorded in kidney mic,
c and s9 incubations at by far lower amount than in liver. only
in kidney mic 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold was also detected.
4. discussion
all in vitro assays carried out using a nadph generating
system, showed mainly cytochrome p450-dependent activity,
whereas nad or nadh confirmed cytosol oxido-reductase
reactions. in fig. 5 are reported the structures of 17␤-bold,
add and the overall metabolites obtained when the compounds
were incubated with liver microsomal fractions and nadph.
three polar metabolites supposed as hydroxylated derivatives
of 17␤-bold were found in extracts from almost all liver

subcellular fractions incubated with nadph. two derivatives
were identified as 6␤-hydroxy- and 16␣-hydroxy-17␤-bold.
cytochrome p450-dependent enzymes (mainly  xxxg590xxx ) in
bovine microsomes are known to catalyse the biotransformation of 17␤-testosterone into 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-testosterone, it
is likely that they could involved in these reactions [17]. the 6␤hydroxy-17␤-bold was also identified, as a product of add
metabolism in liver s9, h and mic and in kidney mic. although
it is not known if cytochrome p450-dependent enzymes act
immediately on add, then reduced to 17␤-bold, or directly
on the 17␤-bold formed by reduction of add, recovering an
hydroxylated metabolite of add (probably 6␤-hydroxy-add;
fig. 5) could sustain the former thesis.
the in vitro metabolite profile of 17␤-bold and add
confirmed that the conversion of 17␤-bold into add and
viceversa occurs mainly in cattle liver. the enzymes responsible
could be the same involved in the interconversion of 17ketosteroids with the corresponding 17␤-hydroxysteroids like
androstenedione (aed), estrone or add into 17␤-testosterone,
17␤- xxxd2037xxx  and 17-␤old, respectively [18]. they catalyse
the oxidation of 17␤-bold into add mainly with nad as
cofactor, and the reduction of add into 17␤-bold mainly with
nadph as cofactor. the role of add both as a precursor and
a metabolite of 17␤-bold could be confirmed.
at the experimental condition adopted 17␣-bold was
formed at very small amount in vitro, that does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the presence 17␣-bold hydroxylated
metabolites among those yet unidentified, and to explain why

fig. 5. putative transformation pathways of 17␤-bold, add and 17␣-bold by bovine liver microsomes and nadph generating system.

17␣-bold is the greatest in vivo urinary metabolite. the in
vitro techniques here used can be considered as a “closed system” and do not take into account all biotransformation reactions
occurring in vivo. in this case, the conjugation reactions that
greatly influence the in vivo rate of excretion, cannot occur. it is
likely that in vivo 17␣-bold and its hydroxyl metabolites are
preferred substrate for conjugation with glucuronic acid allowing all the conjugated form being faster excreted in urine than
17␤-bold glucuronides.
results obtained from the present study contributed to elucidate the main biotransformations of 17␤-bold and add and
the subcellular localization of the enzymes involved.
only a few studies were carried out using in vitro fractions from livers of bovine or other species. van puymbroeck
et al. showed that in vitro the 17␤-bold oxidation into
add was the main reaction in bovine liver microsomes
with some hydroxylated metabolites at the position 6 and
about the 4% of 17␤-bold was transformed; in our study
the biotransformation of 17␤-bold accounted for 10% of
incubated 17␤-bold. the incubations carried with isolated
hepatocytes led to large amounts of 6-hydroxylated metabolites of 17␤–bold and add. the same author screened
for the presence of bold metabolites in bovine urine samples, collected after the in vivo administration of 17␤-bold
undecaonate and confirmed the presence of 17␣-bold, small
amount of 6-hydroxy-17␤-bold, and an unidentified reduction
product [12].
cantiello et al., investigating the in vitro inter-conversion
between 17␤-bold and add in bovine liver fractions by
lc–ms/ms, confirmed add as both a precursor and a metabolite of 17␤-bold, further to the presence of three 17␤-bold
hydroxylated metabolites [19].
an in vitro study conducted in collaboration with the department of food safety and veterinary public health (istituto
superiore di sanità, rome) confirmed that the incubation of

17␣-bold with bovine liver mic and nadph generating system, led to add and to an hydroxyl metabolite identified as
6␤-hydroxy-17␣-bold (fig. 5) [20].
5. conclusion
the aim of the present study was to give a further contribute
to the knowledge of the biotransformation of both 17␤-bold
and add using in vitro models from cattle liver. the results
obtained indicate that, to support the hypothesis of bold and
add exogenous administration in cattle, the urinary excretion of the metabolites identified as 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold,
16␣-hydroxy-17␤-bold could be followed as putative markers
of treatment together with 17␣- and 17␤-bold. the 6␤hydroxy-17␣-bold, still under investigation in our studies in
collaboration [20], was recently adopted as a “screening metabolite” by blokland et al. in routine controls of bovine urine
applying an lc–ms/ms method [21]. these data confirmed
that further to 6␤-hydroxy-17␤-bold and 16␣-hydroxy-17␤bold, also 6␤-hydroxy-17␣-bold, can be used as potential
new marker of anabolic abuse.
