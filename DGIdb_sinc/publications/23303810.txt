background. human immunodeﬁciency virus (hiv)-infected patients on combination active antiretroviral
therapy (cart) are at increased risk of age-related complications. we hypothesized that nucleos(t)ide reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (nrti) may contribute to accelerated aging in hiv-infected individuals on cart via
inhibition of telomerase activity.
methods. telomerase activity and telomere length (tl) were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in vitro in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) cultured with nrti and ex vivo in pbmcs
from uninfected patients exposed to nrti and from hiv-infected patients on nrti-containing cart.
results. lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity in activated pbmcs in vitro. tenofovir was the most potent inhibitor of telomerase activity and caused
greatest shortening of tl in vitro at the therapeutic concentration of 0.3 mum. pbmcs from hiv-infected patients
receiving nrti-containing cart (n = 39) had signiﬁcantly lower telomerase activity than hiv-uninfected patients (n = 47; p = .011) and hiv-infected patients receiving non-nrti–containing cart (n = 11; p < .001). tl
was signiﬁcantly inversely associated with age (p = .009) and the total duration on any nrti (p = .01).
conclusions. nrtis and, speciﬁcally tenofovir at therapeutic concentrations, inhibit telomerase activity
leading to accelerated shortening of tl in activated pbmcs. the relationship between nrti, reduced telomerase
activity, and accelerated aging requires further investigation in hiv-infected individuals on cart.

methods
participants

hiv-infected patients were recruited from the alfred’s infectious diseases outpatient clinic (melbourne, australia), gold
coast sexual health clinic (miami, australia), and st vincent’s
hospital (sydney, australia). inclusion criteria included the
following: patients were hiv antibody positive, patients were receiving cart (either nrti-containing or non-nrti–containing
cart), plasma hiv rna was <50 rna copies/ml for at least
12 months prior to recruitment, and there was no history of
aids-deﬁning illness. sex-matched, healthy hiv-uninfected
individuals were recruited via advertisement within the burnet
institute (melbourne, australia). hiv-uninfected individuals who received nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis

(npep) were recruited at the alfred’s emergency and trauma
centre and the melbourne sexual health centre. npep was
administered for 4 weeks to hiv-negative patients who had
recent signiﬁcant risks of hiv exposure. blood was collected
prior to initiation of npep and then after 1, 4, and 12 weeks.
the health human research ethics committee at each
site approved the study, and all participants provided written
informed consent.

culture of pbmcs in vitro in the presence of nrtis

pbmcs from whole blood of uninfected and hiv-infected patients were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using
 xxxd3253xxx -pague plus (ge healthcare). in some experiments,
pbmcs were stained with  xxxd2676xxx -fitc, anti-cd4-apc,
anti-cd8-pe-cy7 biosciences (bd) and sorted using a facsaria ﬂow cytometer (bd). for the in vitro assays, pbmcs from
hiv-negative healthy donors were cultured with phytohemagglutinin (pha; 10 mug/ml; sigma) and human recombinant
interleukin-2 (il-2; 10 u/ml; roche) or  xxxd2676xxx  (10 mug/ml)
with anti-cd28 (10 mug/ml). nrtis (national institutes of
health aids research and reference reagent program) were
added, and il-2 and nrtis were replenished every 48 hours.
toxicity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium
(mts) dye reduction assay according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (non-radioactive cell proliferation assay, promega).

measurement of telomerase activity

telomerase-containing extracts were prepared from pbmcs,
sorted cells, or after in vitro cell culture [24]. telomerase activity was measured using the standard real-time quantitative
telomerase repeats ampliﬁcation protocol (rq-trap) as previously described [23]. standard curves were generated from
2-fold serial dilutions of telomerase-positive 1301 t-cell leukemia cells (kind gift from dr anthony jaworowski, burnet institute, melbourne, australia). relative telomerase activity
(rta) was expressed relative to 1301 cells and calculated
using the formula: ½2ct 1301 =2ct sample   1000. change in telomerase activity following cell culture was expressed relative to
telomerase activity at baseline.

measurement of tl

tl was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qpcr) where tl was expressed as a ratio to
that of a single (s) copy housekeeping gene 36b4 as previously
described [25]. tl was expressed relative to the single copy
housekeeping gene (t/s ratio) and calculated using the
t=s ratio ¼ ½2ct telomere =2ct 36b4 1 , where ct denotes the threshold cycle. change in relative tl (rtl) following cell culture
was expressed relative to rtl at baseline.

shortening of telomeres with cell division. telomeres, which
are located at the ends of chromosomes, are short, tandem, grich hexanucleotide repeats that repeat ttaggg sequences
that are 5–20 kilobases long [4, 5]. during mitotic cellular division, telomeric dna is not duplicated by dna polymerase,
and telomere length (tl) is progressively shortened until a
critical length is reached and cells then enter replicative senescence [5]. retrospective secondary analyses using samples
from large, randomized studies have shown a strong association between shortened tl in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs) and diseases of aging, including increased cardiovascular risk [6–9] and dementia [10–12].
tl is maintained via the enzyme telomerase [13], which is
a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex containing a critical
 xxxg2261xxx  (tert) subunit that is required for addition of hexameric nucleotides to the telomeric
regions [14]. the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(nrtis) zidovudine (azt), didanosine (ddi), and abacavir
(abc) have been shown to inhibit telomerase activity in replicating cell lines in vitro, leading to accelerated shortening of
tl [15–22]. this is largely thought to be due to inhibition of
tert via chain length termination, similar to the mechanism
of inhibition of the hiv reverse transcriptase (rt). however,
other mechanisms might be at work because these in vitro
assays only measure overall telomerase activity and not tert
activity speciﬁcally [23]. the effects on telomerase activity and
tl of the more commonly used nrtis such as lamivudine
(3tc), emtricitabine (ftc), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(tdf) have not been investigated.
we therefore hypothesized that nrtis inhibit telomerase
activity, leading to enhanced shortening of tl in hiv-infected
patients on nrti-containing cart. the main objective of
this study was to determine the effects of the more commonly
used nrtis on telomerase activity and tl in vitro in activated
pbmcs and ex vivo in pbmcs from both hiv-uninfected and
hiv-infected individuals receiving nrtis.

results
upregulation of telomerase activity in pha-stimulated
pbmcs in vitro

following addition of pha/ xxxg1173xxx  to pbmcs, there was a signiﬁcant increase in telomerase activity, peaking on day 7 poststimulation before returning to basal activity by 21 days
poststimulation; however, there was no change in tl
(figure 1a). upregulation in telomerase activity in pbmcs
was also observed following stimulation with  xxxd2676xxx  and
anti-cd28 (mean ± sd fold change in rta at day 3 compared
with resting cells = 31.8 ± 23.7, n = 4), which was of similar
magnitude to pha/ xxxg1173xxx  (56.4 ± 37.5). all nrtis were noncytotoxic at concentrations ranging from 0.1 mum to 300 mum,
except for tdf, which exhibited cytotoxicity at a concentration >3 mum (supplementary figure 1).
nrtis inhibit telomerase activity in vitro in pha-stimulated
pbmcs

all nrtis tested signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity in
pha-activated pbmcs with varying potency (figure 1b), but
no nrtis inhibited telomerase activity in resting, unstimulated pbmcs (data not shown). tdf was the only nrti

tested that signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity both at
therapeutic concentrations of 0.3 mum [median interquartile
range (iqr), inhibition = 65.1 (64.5%–75.6%), p = .043] and
1 mum [71.3 (52.0%–82.1%), p = .043; all n = 5]. due to cytotoxicity, we did not assess concentrations greater than 3 mum
(figure 1b).
ftc signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity only at
30 mum [38.6 (12.8%–58.4%), p = .028] and 300 mum [54.9
(25.8%–59.8%), p = .046, both n = 6; figure 1b]. inhibition of
telomerase by abc occurred at concentrations >30 mum
[30 mum = 33.5 (21.0%–60.1%); 100 mum = 58.1 (36.0%–62.7%),
and 300 mum = 81.1 (53.7%–84.9%); all n = 5, p = .043;
figure 1b]. azt inhibited telomerase activity at 100 mum [31.7
(20.3%–50.9%)] and 300 mum [63.8 (52.5%–78.1%)] (all n = 6,
p = .028; figure 1b). 3tc signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity overall (friedman p = .029); however, we did not detect
statistical signiﬁcance in pairwise comparisons of individual
concentrations (n = 4; figure 1b). finally, we examined the
combination of tdf (at 0.1 mum and 0.3 mum) and 3tc (at 3.0
mum and 100 mum) because it is commonly used in clinical practice and both nrtis were previously shown to inhibit telomerase activity in vitro (figure 1). we found no evidence of
synergistic inhibition of telomerase activity (data not shown).
we also observed enhanced shortening of tl following incubation with 3tc, abc, and tdf, consistent with inhibition
of telomerase activity mediated by these nrtis (figure 1c).
again, tdf was the only nrti tested that enhanced shortening of tl at therapeutic concentrations, which is in agreement
with the potent inhibition of telomerase activity (figure 1b).
azt and ftc did not enhance shortening of tl at all tested
concentrations in pha-activated pbmcs (figure 1c).
no change in telomerase and tl in hiv-uninfected
individuals exposed to nrti

next, we investigated the effects of short-term nrti exposure
in vivo on tl and telomerase activity in pbmcs, cd4+, and
cd8+ t-cell subsets from 29 healthy, hiv-uninfected people
[all males, mean (sd) age = 34 (8.6) years] who had recently
been exposed to hiv and had received nrtis as part of
npep. the nrtis administered included the combination of
ftc and tdf (n = 27) or 3tc and azt (n = 2), with or
without lopinavir/ritonavir for 4 weeks. cell sorting and
tert and tl analyses were only performed on patients who
had attended on at least 1 occasion during npep as well as
following npep cessation (n = 11). there was no signiﬁcant
change in tl and telomerase activity (log-transformed) at
baseline (week 0), during npep (week 1 and week 4), and 8
weeks after npep cessation in total pbmcs (week 12;
figure 2a) or in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells (data not shown).
rta in both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells was signiﬁcantly lower
than rta in pbmcs [mean (sd)]. rta pre-nrti was 1.82

categorical variables were summarized using frequency and
percentage. continuous variables were ﬁrst assessed for skew
and summarized using mean and sd. signiﬁcant differences
in independent samples were assessed using the chi2 test or
fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test or
mann–whitney u test for continuous variables as appropriate.
the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine signiﬁcance between paired samples. comparison of telomerase activity and tl using different concentrations of the same nrti
was determined using the friedman nonparametric paired
test followed by the wilcoxon signed rank test. generalized
estimating equations were used to investigate associations between telomere length and telomerase activity over time in
hiv-uninfected patients who received npep. tert was log10
transformed in order to meet the normal distribution assumption. signiﬁcant differences in the rates of change of tl and
tert against age by hiv status were assessed by adding an
interaction term between hiv status and age in the linear regression. telomerase activity and tl in pbmcs from patients
on nrti-containing cart were compared using a univariable
linear regression analysis adjusted for age. multivariable linear
regression was used to further adjust these associations for potential confounders identiﬁed as priori (p < .2 in the univariable analysis). p values < .05 were considered signiﬁcant.
statistical analyses were carried out using prism v5 (graphpad) or stata v11 software (statacorp).

36b4 (a), and telomerase activity was measured using real-time quantitative telomerase repeats ampliﬁcation protocol and expressed relative to that of
telomerase-positive 1301 cell line (b) in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from hiv-uninfected individuals receiving nrti-containing
nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (npep). horizontal lines represent the mean and error bars represent the standard deviation. statistical
signiﬁcance over weeks 0, 1, and 4 was determined using a generalized estimating equations method, and signiﬁcance between week 4 and week 12
was determined using the wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data. gray bars represent the period when subjects were on npep.

discussion
accelerated aging remains a signiﬁcant problem in hivinfected patients on cart [2, 3]. in this study we asked
whether nrtis play a role in accelerated aging in hiv-infected
individuals by inhibition of telomerase activity. we assessed
the effects of commonly used nrtis on telomerase activity
and tl in vitro using pha-activated pbmcs, which we
believe are more physiologically relevant than cell lines.
similar to previous studies of cell lines [16–22], we showed
that all nrtis signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity in
vitro. tdf was the only nrti that signiﬁcantly inhibited telomerase activity and tl at concentrations that are therapeutic
in vivo. furthermore, we showed that hiv-infected patients
receiving nrti-containing cart had lower telomerase

we then examined telomerase activity and tl in pbmcs from
hiv-infected patients (n = 39) who were receiving nrticontaining cart with hiv rna < 50 copies/ml (see table 1
for patient details). telomerase activity (log-transformed) in
hiv-infected patients (n = 36) was signiﬁcantly decreased
when compared with uninfected controls (n = 42) after adjusting for age (p = .011; figure 3a). there was a trend to shorter
tl in pbmcs from hiv-infected patients when compared
with uninfected controls using a linear regression analysis on
hiv status and adjusted for age; however, this did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance (p = .061; figure 3b).
using a linear regression analysis, we found that tl negatively correlated with age in hiv-infected patients (beta = −0.02,
p = .009), but we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant correlation between
tl and age in uninfected controls (beta = −0.004, p = .430).
when we compared hiv-infected patients with uninfected
controls, we found no signiﬁcant difference in the rate of
change of tl (p = .111; figure 3c) and telomerase activity
(p = .659, data not shown) against age.
next we compared hiv-infected patients receiving nrticontaining cart (“on” nrti; n = 39) and patients receiving
non-nrti–containing cart (“off” nrti; n = 11). these patients had been switched to non-nrti–containing cart by
their physicians for reasons other than virological failure and
had been off nrtis for a median (iqr) of 48 (45–51) weeks
(see table 1 for clinical details). telomerase activity in pbmcs
was signiﬁcantly lower in patients who were still receiving

nrti (p < .001; figure 3a), and there was no signiﬁcant difference in tl (p = .840; figure 3b) and no difference in tl
from uninfected controls (p = .162; figure 3b).
six of the 11 patients who had ceased nrtis had matched
samples available from when they were on nrti and after
36–60 weeks off nrti (but still on suppressive cart), but
there were no signiﬁcant differences in telomerase (figure 3d)
or tl (figure 3e) when on and off nrti.
in a univariate analysis of all hiv-infected patients on
nrti (n = 39), tl was inversely associated with age (p = .009)
and with duration of nrti-containing cart (p = .01;
table 2). there were no signiﬁcant associations between telomerase activity and any clinical parameters (table 2). in a
multivariate analysis for tl and telomerase, no parameter remained statistically signiﬁcant.

activity when compared with both hiv-uninfected controls
and hiv-infected patients receiving non-nrti–containing
cart.
multiple previous studies using a range of cell lines have
shown that some nrtis, including azt [16–18], ddi [18],
and abc [20], reduce telomerase activity and tl in vitro.
however, the effects of the more commonly used nrti,
namely, tdf, 3tc, and ftc, have not been evaluated in vitro
to date. we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that nrtis inhibit
telomerase activity in pha-activated pbmcs and that tdf
was the most potent inhibitor of telomerase, leading to accelerated shortening of tl. it is important to note that we only
measured rta and tl in total pbmcs and therefore are currently unable to determine from these experiments whether
the main effects of nrti were on cd4+ or cd8+ t cells, or
speciﬁc subsets of t cells, or even secondary to effects on non-

t–cell populations such as monocytes. this will be important
to understand for further studies.
tdf is a prodrug of tenofovir. in vivo, tdf is converted to
an acyclic nucleoside phosphate, which is an analog of adenosine 5′ monophosphate called tenofovir diphosphate [26]. one
explanation for the effects of tdf on telomerase could be that
tdf has a much higher afﬁnity toward the mammalian tert
subunit than other nrtis tested in this study. tdf is a very
potent inhibitor of hiv rt, with an ec50 value of 5 nm in
pbmcs, and it has a long intracellular half-life of >60 hours
in the form of its active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate [27].
in contrast, the other nrtis have far higher ec50 values, including azt (60 nm), 3tc (45 nm), ftc (58 nm), and abc
(260 nm) [26, 28–30]. the signiﬁcantly higher ec50 with rt
inhibition by tdf may explain tdf’s potent effect on telomerase via potential inhibition of tert.

we were surprised to demonstrate in vitro that ftc and
3tc inhibited telomerase activity only at high concentrations.
telomeres are made up of ttaggg repeat sequences. if
nrtis inhibit telomerase via inhibition of tert leading
to chain termination, then a cytosine analogue (such as 3tc,
2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine or ftc, 5-ﬂuoro-1-(2r,5s)-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3- oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine) would not be expected to inhibit tert. these data raise the possibility that
nrti, or potentially 3tc and ftc, inhibit telomerase activity
by an alternative mechanism to tert inhibition, such as inhibition of cell proliferation [18]. in agreement with our observation, some of the nrtis that we tested have been shown to
induce cell cycle arrest in human cancer cells (tdf and ftc
[31]) and to inhibit cellular proliferation in activated pbmcs
(azt, 3tc, and tdf [32]).
changes in tl and telomerase activity have previously been
described in cells from hiv-infected patients, in the absence
of nrti treatment. it has been shown in hiv-infected patients not receiving cart that tl is reduced in total cd8+
t cells [33], hiv-speciﬁc cd8+t cells [34], naive cd4+
t cells [35], and monocytes [36]. in vitro hiv infection of
activated cd4+ t-cells, in the absence of any nrti, led to a
reduction in telomerase activity [37]. in contrast, in cells from
hiv-infected patients, both an increase and decrease in telomerase activity in different t-cell subsets have been reported [33, 34], and no prior studies have examined telomerase
activity in total pbmcs.
given these known mixed effects of hiv infection on telomerase activity and tl, we ﬁrst assessed the effects of nrti
on telomerase and tl in hiv-uninfected individuals who had
received nrti and were unable to demonstrate any signiﬁcant
change in telomerase or tl. these ﬁndings could be explained

by the very short administration of the nrtis, that is, only 4
weeks. indeed, a recent study showed that relatively shortterm exposure to nrti during pregnancy did not signiﬁcantly
affect tl in both hiv-infected mothers and uninfected
infants [38]. in future studies, it may be of interest to assess
the effects of nrtis such as tdf or 3tc/ftc in patients
with chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. patients with
chronic hbv do not have the abnormalities in t-cell turnover
seen in hiv infection; however, they frequently receive longterm nrti treatment to control hbv replication [39].
a limited number of studies have assessed telomerase activity and tl in hiv-infected individuals receiving cart. no
studies have assessed these parameters in pbmcs, and most
studies have enrolled very few patients [22, 33]. in 1 study, the
authors demonstrated an increase in tl in cd4+ t cells and
a decrease in tl in cd8+ t cells in 7 hiv-discordant monozygotic twins who were only receiving nrtis and had persistent hiv replication [33]. in another study, telomerase activity
in both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from hiv-infected patients
was similar to that in hiv-negative controls; however, telomerase activity decreased in both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from
hiv-infected patients following introduction of nrti monotherapy with either ddi or azt [22].
in our study we chose to measure tl and telomerase activity
in total pbmcs given the large population-based studies that
demonstrate an association between clinical outcomes such as
cardiovascular disease and tl in pbmcs [6, 7]. in addition, we
hypothesized that if nrti inhibited telomerase activity, this
should occur in all mononuclear cells that express telomerase,
not just cd4+ t cells where nrtis are active against hiv. although we detected signiﬁcant reduction of telomerase activity
in patients on nrti-containing cart, it is possible that we

the greatest effect observed with tdf. reduced telomerase activity was greatest in hiv-infected patients on nrti-containing
cart. an important future clinical question will be to determine whether any inhibition of telomerase by nrtis in vivo is
reversible following cessation of nrti. the long-term effects
in hiv-infected patients of nrti exposure on telomerase activity, tl, and accelerated aging warrant further investigation.

did not detect signiﬁcant shortening of tl in pbmcs from
hiv-infected subjects, given the potentially divergent changes
in tl in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and/or the small sample
size [33]. finally, telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres has been described in multiple human cell
types [40–42] and would be of interest to explore in future
studies. to better understand the differences in ﬁndings from
our study and previous studies, future studies should assess tl
and telomerase activity in sorted t-cell subsets.
we found that the duration of nrti-containing cart was
inversely associated with tl and that there was no association
with telomerase activity. the association with duration of
nrti-containing cart demonstrated that for every year on
nrti-containing cart, there was a 0.036-unit reduction in
tl, and for a 1-year increase in age, there was a 0.018-unit
reduction in tl. however, in a multivariate analysis, both parameters were no longer statistically signiﬁcantly related to tl.
potential explanations for this ﬁnding could include the small
sample size or an interaction between these 2 parameters. the
small sample size also did not allow us to take into account
other factors that could potentially confound our ﬁndings,
such as chronic immune activation, cytomegalovirus coinfection, cigarette smoking, levels of physical activity, and the use
of statins and other art drugs [7] [43–48]. saquinavir has
been demonstrated to upregulate telomerase activity in vitro
[44, 45]. however, despite the possibility of saquinavir and
therefore other pis antagonizing nrti-mediated telomerase
inhibition in vivo, we still observed signiﬁcantly lower telomerase activity in patients receiving nrti-containing cart, suggesting that any upregulation of telomerase activity by pis was
not sufﬁcient to overcome the inhibitory effect of nrtis on
telomerase activity.
there were several limitations in our study. first, we were
unable to prove that nrtis inhibited telomerase activity in
vivo because we only performed a cross-sectional study comparing patients on nrti, off nrti, and hiv-uninfected controls. we did not include a control group of hiv-infected
patients naive to cart given the potential confounder of hiv
itself inhibiting telomerase activity as demonstrated previously
in vitro [37]. second, our comparison of patients on and off
nrti was largely cross sectional, the number of samples that
were matched was small, and the length of time off nrti was
relatively short (median of 48 weeks). any effects of nrtis on
telomerase and tl may take many years to become apparent
following initiation of nrti and/or may reverse following cessation of nrti. however, in the hiv-infected patients on
nrti-containing cart in this study, the median time on
nrti was 123 months (over a 10-year period), and we therefore believe this to be adequate time to see any signiﬁcant
changes in telomerase activity and tl.
in summary, we have demonstrated that all nrtis inhibit
telomerase activity and tl in activated pbmc in vitro, with
