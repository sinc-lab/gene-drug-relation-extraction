10.1152/ajpheart.01126.2003.—an important path of extracellular
calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle (vsm) cells is through
voltage-activated ca2⫹ channels of the plasma membrane. both high
(hva)- and low (lva)-voltage-activated ca2⫹ currents are present
in vsm cells, yet little is known about the relevance of the lva
t-type channels. in this report, we provide molecular evidence for
t-type ca2⫹ channels in rat arterial vsm and characterize endogenous lva ca2⫹ currents in the aortic smooth muscle-derived cell line
a7r5. avp is a vasoconstrictor hormone that, at physiological concentrations, stimulates ca2⫹ oscillations (spiking) in monolayer cultures of a7r5 cells. the present study investigated the role of t-type
ca2⫹ channels in this response with a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches. we demonstrate that avp-stimulated
ca2⫹ spiking can be abolished by  xxxd2638xxx  at low concentrations
(⬍1 ␮m) that should not inhibit l-type currents. infection of a7r5
cells with an adenovirus containing the  xxxg308xxx  t-type channel resulted in robust lva ca2⫹ currents but did not alter the avpstimulated ca2⫹ spiking response. together these data suggest that
t-type ca2⫹ channels are necessary for the onset of avp-stimulated
calcium oscillations; however, lva ca2⫹ entry through these channels is not limiting for repetitive ca2⫹ spiking observed in a7r5 cells.

calcium handling is a critical component of cellular function
that involves a complex set of pathways. signal transduction
mechanisms vary widely depending on the particular cell type
and function. in myocytes, influx of extracellular calcium
provides a signal for many downstream events that ultimately
influence muscle contraction. however, myocytes constitute a
broad class of cells that are specialized according to their
location and function. vascular smooth muscle (vsm) cells
form the muscular layer of blood vessels. vsm myocytes
respond to diverse stimuli that signal either contraction or
relaxation. coordinated contraction of vsm cells in the blood
vessel wall leads to vessel constriction; hence, vsm tone is
closely related to systemic blood pressure. elucidating the
mechanisms of vsm response can provide valuable information leading to new, more effective therapies for the treatment
of cardiovascular diseases.
calcium can enter cells via sarcolemmal voltage-gated ca2⫹
channels, which respond to changes in membrane potential.
two classes of voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels have been reported in vsm cells, including the well-characterized high-

voltage-activated (hva) l-type channels and low-voltageactivated (lva) t-type channels (2, 3). molecular cloning
studies showed that t-type ca2⫹ channels are encoded by a
family of related genes,  xxxg307xxx  (␣1g),  xxxg308xxx  (␣1h), and
 xxxg309xxx  (␣1i) (reviewed in ref. 34). northern blot and in situ
hybridization analyses revealed their expression primarily in
brain ( xxxg307xxx –3.3), heart ( xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg308xxx ), and kidney
( xxxg308xxx ) (4, 12, 24, 35, 40). because the three t-type ca2⫹
channels are functionally similar based on kinetic properties
(i.e., low activation threshold, fast inactivation, small singlechannel conductance), initial electrophysiological studies did
not distinguish the different isotypes. however, more recent
analyses of the cloned t-type channels have provided insight
into their individual kinetics and pharmacology (25, 28, 30).
still, means of distinguishing members of the cav3 gene family
other than at the molecular level are limited.
l-type ca2⫹ channels in vsm are an important therapeutic
target for a class of antihypertensive drugs, the calcium channel blockers. t-type ca2⫹ channels are also present in vsm,
and they comprise a separate pharmacological class resistant to
drugs that block l-type and other hva channels.  xxxd2638xxx 
selectively inhibits t-type over l-type channels (28, 31, 33),
and it was previously marketed as an alternative ca2⫹ channel
blocker (posicor; hoffmann-laroche, basel, switzerland).
posicor was withdrawn because of harmful drug interactions,
and it remains unclear whether the antihypertensive effects of
 xxxd2638xxx  were due to t-type channel block. more specific
t-type channel blockers are still not available, and consequently very little is known about the involvement of t-type
ca2⫹ channels in vsm calcium regulatory mechanisms.
the a7r5 cell line provides a convenient model system to
study mechanisms of vsm calcium regulation. this cell line
was originally derived from embryonic rat thoracic aorta and
retains many characteristics of vsm (20), including responses
to vasoactive hormones. avp is a potent vasoconstrictor hormone that plays an important role in blood pressure maintenance. exposure of vsm cells to avp leads to a rapid increase
in intracellular ca2⫹ that signals a contractile response within
seconds to minutes. at nanomolar concentrations, avp stimulates influx of extracellular ca2⫹ and release of ca2⫹ from
intracellular stores (5, 37), leading to contraction.
the a7r5 cell line also exhibits a separate response to
physiological (picomolar) concentrations of avp, and some
details of the signal transduction pathway have been resolved
(6, 7). exposure of a7r5 cells to 10 –500 pm avp induces a
pattern of calcium oscillations or “spiking” (6) associated with
repetitive action potentials. such oscillations may be related to

arterial vasomotion in vivo, which can be a determinant of
blood pressure and peripheral resistance (14).
our objective was to characterize lva t-type ca2⫹ channels in vsm at both molecular and functional levels. immunohistochemistry experiments revealed widespread expression
of  xxxg307xxx , but not  xxxg308xxx , in arterial vsm. rt-pcr experiments corroborated the immunostaining results. using a7r5
cells as a model system for vsm function, we investigated the
possible involvement of t-type ca2⫹ channels in avp-induced

ca2⫹ spiking with  xxxd2638xxx  block or adenoviral overexpression of t-type channels.
materials and methods

cell culture. a7r5 cells were cultured as described previously (8).
cells were subcultured onto rectangular (9 ⫻ 22 mm, no. 11/ 2) glass
coverslips or plastic tissue culture dishes (corning).
immunohistochemistry. polyclonal antibodies were prepared
against peptides derived from  xxxg307xxx  (cqgedtrnitnksdcaea)

fig. 1. immunostain of rat heart for  xxxg307xxx . frozen sections from rat heart (14 ␮m) were incubated with either preimmune serum (a, c, and e) or anti- xxxg307xxx 
antiserum (b, d, and f), and immunodetection was done with the abc elite kit with vector vip chromogenic substrate (vector laboratories). positive stain
was especially evident in aorta (b and d) and the coronary vasculature (f).

the antigenic peptide sequences have no homology to other voltagegated ion channels. antibodies were immunoabsorbed to the common
motif “dtrni” to avoid cross-reactivity and then twice immunoaffinity purified. rat tissues were removed and immediately frozen in
isopentane on dry ice. tissues were embedded in o.c.t. embedding
medium (tissue-tek) for cryosectioning (12- to 14-␮m sections).
sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-pbs and then dehydrated in a series of increasing alcohol concentrations. sections were
incubated in blocking buffer (1% goat serum-pbs-0.1% triton
x-100) for 1 h at room temperature, and then primary antibody
(diluted up to 1:5,000 in block buffer) was added for 1 h. sections
were rinsed in pbs-0.1% triton x-100, and then antibody detection
was done with an abc elite staining kit with vector vip chromogenic substrate (vector laboratories). a7r5 cell cultures were grown
on glass coverslips and treated essentially the same for immunocytochemistry, except that detection was by fitc-labeled secondary
antibody (amersham). digital images were taken with an sp700
camera and mds 120 software (kodak).
rt-pcr. total rna was prepared from cultured a7r5 cells by the
acid-guanidinium-phenol extraction method (9). rt-pcr was carried
out as previously described (38). quantitative real-time pcr was used
to determine relative expression of  xxxg307xxx ,  xxxg308xxx , and  xxxg309xxx .
primers and dual-labeled probes (integrated dna technologies)
were included in reactions containing either cdna or known
amounts of plasmid dna and platinum quantitative pcr supermix- xxxg2389xxx  (invitrogen) run on a bio-rad i-cycler. primers and
probes were as follows:  xxxg307xxx  upper 5⬘-ctgtgaccaggagtccacct-3⬘,  xxxg307xxx  lower 5⬘-tgggggctgagcgtcttcat-3⬘,

(invitrogen), and these plasmids were used to construct standard
curves. absolute amounts of  xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg309xxx  in mrna from a7r5
cells were determined by extrapolation of real-time pcr threshold
cycle values to the standard curves.
adenoviral construction. because ca2⫹ channel cdnas approach
the size limit for adenovirus inserts, we chose a system that allows the
homologous recombination step to occur in bacteria (18). the human
 xxxg308xxx  cdna was cloned into the shuttle vector, pshuttle-cmv, and
then cotransformed into escherichia coli strain bj5183 with adeasy-1 viral backbone. recombinants were confirmed by restriction
digestion before transfection into hek 293 cells for viral propagation.
a control virus was prepared in the same way, consisting of the
“empty” shuttle vector pshuttle-cmv in the adeasy-1 backbone.
a7r5 cells were plated and infected 24 h later with adenoviruses at a
multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2–5. experiments were performed
2–5 days after infection.
intracellular ca2⫹ concentration measurements. a7r5 cells were
plated on glass coverslips and infected with adeasy-␣1h or adenoviruses expressing empty shuttle vector (moi ⬃5). after infection for
3–5 days, lva currents were measured by patch-clamp electrophysiology to confirm expression of functional  xxxg308xxx  (␣1h) channels in
adeasy-␣1h-infected cells. calcium measurements were done essentially as described previously (7). coverslips were washed twice with
control medium (in mm: 135 nacl, 5.9 kcl, 1.5 cacl2, 1.2 mgcl2,
11.5 glucose, and 11.6 hepes, ph 7.3) and then incubated in the

same medium with 2 ␮m fura-2 am (molecular probes), 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx , and 0.02% pluronic f127 detergent for 120 min at
room temperature (20 –23°c) in the dark. the cells were then washed
twice and incubated in the dark in control medium for 1–3 h before the
start of the experiment. fura-2 fluorescence (at 510 nm) was measured
in cell populations with a perkin-elmer ls50b fluorescence spectrophotometer. background fluorescence was determined at the end of
the experiment by quenching the fura-2 fluorescence for 10 –15 min in
the presence of 5 ␮m  xxxd2379xxx  and 6 mm mncl2 in ca2⫹-free
medium. after background fluorescence was subtracted, the ratio of
fluorescence at 340-nm excitation to that at 380 nm was calculated
and calibrated in terms of intracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i).
fluo-3 am (molecular probes) was used to measure [ca2⫹]i
spiking frequency in a7r5 cells because it gave a better signal-tonoise ratio for detecting individual spikes. a7r5 cells (either uninfected or infected with empty vector or adeasy-␣1h) were incubated
for 1 h in the presence of 10 ␮m fluo-3 am, 0.1% bovine serum
albumin, and 0.02% pluronic f127 detergent and then washed and
incubated in control medium in the absence of fluo-3 am for at least
30 min. for these experiments, a single excitation wavelength (505
nm) was used and emitted fluorescence (at 535 nm) was collected at
0.5-s intervals. the frequency of ca2⫹ spiking was measured during
exposure to avp (50 –100 pm) by counting the number of spikes
during a 5-min period at least 10 min after addition of avp (to ensure
that spike frequency had stabilized).
electrophysiology. a7r5 cells were trypsinized and plated on
12-mm round glass coverslips at low density and allowed to adhere
for at least 30 min before mounting into a perfusion chamber (0.8-ml
volume). glass pipettes were made from borosilicate glass tubing

(kimax-51; kimble glass) and coated with sylgard (dow corning).
pipettes had resistances of 1–2 m⍀ when filled with internal solution
containing (in mm) 30 cscl, 100 cs-aspartate, 10 tris-egta, 2.7
cacl2 (100 nm free ca2⫹), 2 mgcl2, 5 hepes-csoh, and 2

␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx  (calbiochem) from a 20 mg/ml stock solution

tea-oh, 130 mes-h, 10 bacl2, 1 mgcl2, and 5 hepes-mes, ph
7.3. using ba2⫹ as the charge carrier helped to distinguish between
slow inactivating l-type and fast inactivating t-type ca2⫹ channels.
two hundred micromolar and twenty micromolar nicl2 were
added to the bath solution to inhibit endogenous and exogenous
t-type currents, respectively.  xxxd2638xxx  (hoffmann-laroche) was
prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in water and added to the bath
solution at the final concentration indicated. currents were recorded
with an axopatch 200b amplifier (axon instruments) in voltageclamp mode, filtered at 5 khz (low-pass bessel filter), sampled  xxxd1891xxx 
khz with a digidata 1200 interface and pclamp8 software, and
stored on a computer. the pclamp8 software was used for data
acquisition and analysis. seventy to eighty-five percent series resistance (rs) was compensated, and liquid junction potential was subtracted offline. leak and l-type current were compensated by subtraction of peak current at ⫺50-mv holding potential or mean current
at the end of a 200-ms pulse. we observed no significant rundown of
endogenous or exogenous t-type currents, although some cells displayed slight runup over time. this property is useful for isolating
endogenous t-type currents from l-type currents, which display

results

previous northern blot and in situ hybridization results
indicated that t-type ca2⫹ channels are primarily found in
brain and heart, along with notable high expression of  xxxg308xxx 
in kidney. polyclonal antibodies were made against  xxxg307xxx  and
 xxxg308xxx  to further investigate their distribution. staining patterns of these antibodies in brain are consistent with previous

in situ hybridization studies (data not shown; ref. 40). the
 xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg308xxx  antibodies showed differential staining of
brain and other tissues, ruling out cross-reactivity.
incubation of rat tissues with the  xxxg307xxx  antibody revealed
prominent staining of arteries. in heart,  xxxg307xxx  was seen in the
vsm layer of large muscular vessels such as aorta (fig. 1,
a–d) and in smaller coronary arteries throughout the myocardium (fig. 1, e and f). the  xxxg308xxx  antibody did not show a
similar pattern of arterial staining (not shown), suggesting that
this isotype has a more limited distribution in the cardiovascular system.
the  xxxg307xxx  antibody showed marked staining of peripheral
vasculature in brain, kidney, lung, liver, and testes (figs. 2– 4).
a higher-magnification image of an immunopositive arteriole
in brain (fig. 2c, enlarged in 2d) showed staining within the
vsm cells, distinguished by their elongated nuclei. figure 3
shows  xxxg307xxx -positive staining of renal arteries, along with
smaller arterioles within the kidney. figure 3c shows positive
immunoreactivity for  xxxg307xxx  in the afferent arteriole and
within the glomerular capillaries.  xxxg308xxx  was not detectable in
the renal vasculature but rather was more prominent in the
cortical collecting tubules (fig. 3d).

fig. 4. immunostain of rat tissues for
 xxxg307xxx . cryosections (12–14 ␮m) of rat lung
(a and b), testes (c and d), and liver (e and
f) were treated with anti- xxxg307xxx  antiserum.
results are shown at ⫻40 (a, c, and e) and
⫻100 (b, d, and f) magnification. note that
positive reactivity with sperm (c and d),
also known to contain t-type ca2⫹ channels,
served as an internal control for immunoreactivity of  xxxg307xxx  antiserum.

t-type ca channels in a7r5 cells

vascular components of other tissues such as lung, liver, and
testes were markedly positive with the  xxxg307xxx  antibody (fig.
4). in liver,  xxxg307xxx  was found specifically in the artery of triads
(consisting of hepatic artery, vein, and duct) and also in the thin
lining of the hepatic duct, presumably corresponding to smooth
muscle (fig. 4, e and f).
previous electrophysiology studies reported lva ca2⫹ currents in isolated vsm cell preparations (1–3, 23, 36) and a7r5
cells (27). l- and t-type channels have also been detected by
rt-pcr on isolated arteriole preparations and a7r5 cells (17,
41). immunostaining of a7r5 cells in culture showed specific
staining for  xxxg307xxx  (fig. 5b), with a consistent perinuclear
concentration and more diffuse cytoplasmic staining. the
 xxxg308xxx  antibody showed little or no reactivity, except for a
punctate pattern within the nucleus of some cells (fig. 5d).
to further characterize lva channels in a7r5 cells, we
carried out rt-pcr using primers to detect all three t-type
ca2⫹ channels ( xxxg307xxx –3.3), shown schematically in fig. 6a.
rt-pcr of a7r5 rna resulted in a single product of ⬃500 bp
(fig. 6b). isolation and sequencing of this product identified
both  xxxg307xxx  (a particular splice variation of 492 bp) and  xxxg309xxx 
(474 bp; not distinguishable on the agarose gel). the expected
size of the  xxxg308xxx  product is 489 bp; however, this isotype was
not detected by subcloning and dna sequencing of the pcr
products. we confirmed these observations with quantitative
real-time pcr for all three isotypes, in which  xxxg307xxx  was
present at a level in excess of 100-fold greater than  xxxg309xxx , and
 xxxg308xxx  was undetectable.

lva ca2⫹ currents are difficult to measure in vsm cell
preparations, partially because of the coexistence of more
robust hva l-type channels. however, we were able to detect
lva currents in 33% of control a7r5 cells tested. figure 7a
shows typical traces of l-type and t-type ba2⫹ currents
measured simultaneously in a single cell in response to a
voltage step protocol. t-type currents are easily distinguishable
by fast inactivating kinetics, compared with slow inactivating
l-type currents, and the lva t-type currents are visible as a
characteristic bump in the i-v curve around ⫺40 mv (fig. 7b).
the conductance curve obtained as described in materials and
methods was fitted with a double boltzmann distribution (fig.
7c). fit results averaged from 10 cells are presented in table 1.
the endogenous ca2⫹ currents in a7r5 cells showed relative
ni2⫹ sensitivities characteristic for  xxxg307xxx  t-type channels. at
a concentration of 200 ␮m, ni2⫹ reversibly inhibited 48 ⫾ 6%
(n ⫽ 6) of the endogenous t-type current recorded in isolation
after rundown of l-type current (fig. 8).
when a7r5 cells are exposed to very low (picomolar)
concentrations of avp, calcium oscillations are induced. to
examine a possible role for t-type ca2⫹ channels in avpinduced ca2⫹ spiking we applied  xxxd2638xxx , which at low
concentrations is selective for lva over hva ca2⫹ channels.
 xxxd2638xxx  gradually abolished avp-stimulated spiking in a
dose-dependent manner, at concentrations ranging from 10 to
100 nm (fig. 9).
because calcium entry via l-type channels is required for
avp-induced ca2⫹ spiking (8) and action potential generation,

fig. 5. immunostain of a7r5 cells for  xxxg307xxx 
and  xxxg308xxx . a7r5 cells were cultured on glass
coverslips, fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and then treated with either preimmune
serum (a and c) or anti- xxxg307xxx  (b) or anticav3.2 (d) antisera. immunodetection was with
fitc-labeled secondary antibody.

ivs3 are delineated by bars. b: pcr resulted in a single major product of ⬃500 bp, indicated by the arrow. molecular weight markers (left lane) were 100-bp
ladder (pharmacia).

it was important to rule out an effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on l-type
ca2⫹ currents. figure 10 shows the differential effect of 1 ␮m
 xxxd2638xxx  on l-type and t-type ca2⫹ currents in a7r5 cells,
measured at a single holding potential of ⫺80 mv and test
potentials of 0 and ⫺40 mv for l- and t-type currents,
respectively. although 63.5 ⫾ 8.2% (n ⫽ 5) of t-type current
was blocked,  xxxd2638xxx  had no effect on the relatively large
l-type ca2⫹ currents in a7r5 cells. at a concentration of 1
␮m,  xxxd2638xxx  did not affect l-type currents even with repetitive stimulation and prolonged exposure up to 20 min (data not
shown). although it was not systematically studied, we noted
that prolonged passage of a7r5 cells (beyond 25–30 passages)

resulted in loss of the ca2⫹ spiking response, with a coincident
loss of t-type ca2⫹ currents (fig. 10g).
because t-type ca2⫹ channels have been implicated in
action potential generation and pacemaking in cardiac and
neuronal cells, the ability of lva ca2⫹ currents to alter the
properties of avp-stimulated ca2⫹ spiking was tested by
overexpressing t-type ca2⫹ channels in a7r5 cells. to get
efficient, high-level expression of exogenous t-type ca2⫹
channels, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus carrying
the coding sequence for human  xxxg308xxx , referred to as adeasy␣1h. infection of a7r5 cells with adeasy-␣1h resulted in
large lva ca2⫹ currents in all cells tested (n ⬎ 100; fig. 11).

these currents were much larger than endogenous currents
(compare with fig. 7), and they were classified as  xxxg308xxx 
t-type currents by their relatively high sensitivity to ni2⫹,
whereby 20 ␮m ni2⫹ reversibly blocked 78 ⫾ 1% of current
(n ⫽ 9; fig. 11d).
uninfected a7r5 cells and a7r5 cells infected with either
empty vector or adeasy-␣1h were treated with varying concentrations of avp, which induced a concentration-dependent
increase in spike frequency that was similar in each of the
treatment groups. figure 12 shows representative traces from
empty vector- and adeasy-␣1h-infected coverslips, along
with statistical analysis of spike frequencies for the two groups.
although adeasy-␣1h-infected cells had much larger t-type
currents (fig. 11), avp-induced ca2⫹ spiking was not different. resting [ca2⫹]i and amplitude of ca2⫹ spikes were also
analyzed in fura-2-loaded cells. mean resting [ca2⫹]i was
46 ⫾ 1 nm in uninfected cells, 48 ⫾ 4 nm in empty vectortreated cells, and 51 ⫾ 2 nm in adeasy-␣1h-treated cells [no
significant difference (p ⬎ 0.1); n ⫽ 8 for each]. spike

we present molecular, electrophysiological, and pharmacological evidence that  xxxg307xxx  t-type ca2⫹ channels are expressed in vascular tissues and are functionally important for
vasoconstrictor responses in a7r5 cells derived from aorta
vsm. our immunostaining results indicate a wide distribution
of  xxxg307xxx  in peripheral arterial vsm and nonvascular smooth
muscle (e.g., trachea, hepatic duct, and seminiferous tubule).
using low nanomolar concentrations of  xxxd2638xxx , we were
able to completely abolish the avp-stimulated ca2⫹ spiking
response in a7r5 cells. to further investigate a putative role for
t-type channels in ca2⫹ spiking, we overexpressed  xxxg308xxx 
channels in a7r5 cells and then analyzed frequency and amplitude of ca2⫹ spiking. although lva ca2⫹ entry appears to
be necessary for ca2⫹ oscillations, t-type currents are not
limiting for repetitive ca2⫹ spiking, because their dramatic
overexpression did not alter ca2⫹ responses to avp.
calcium is an essential regulator of vsm contractility and
tone, which underscores the importance of understanding calcium regulation as it relates to therapeutic applications in
hypertension. l-type ca2⫹ channels are a common target for
antihypertensive drugs, whereby block of ca2⫹ entry leads to
muscle relaxation and vasodilation. it has long been known
that t-type ca2⫹ channels coexist with l-type channels in
vsm, yet functions of t-type channel are far less understood.
t-type channels activate at lower voltages, inactivate rapidly,

whether ca2⫹ entry via t-type channels serves to effect local
signaling or contraction in arterial myocytes.
we present data that corroborate previous reports of lva
t-type ca2⫹ currents in coronary and peripheral arterial
smooth muscle. our survey of rat tissues revealed that  xxxg307xxx 
is present throughout the vasculature. we already know that
l-type ca2⫹ channels of arterial vsm play an important role
in vasoregulation, and here we present molecular and electro-

leading to their “transient” nature, and have relatively small
(⬍10 ps) single-channel conductance. therefore, ca2⫹ entry
through t-type channels most likely has functions distinct from
l-type channels. in the heart, hva ca2⫹ channels are a major
contributor to excitation-contraction coupling in ventricular
myocytes, whereas lva channels are concentrated in nodal
pacemaker cells (4) and play a role in generation of action
potentials (16, 43). local release of ca2⫹ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ca2⫹ “sparks”) is associated with t-type channel openings in the late diastolic phase in feline atrial pacemaker cells (19, 26). t-type channels may also trigger sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2⫹ release in ventricular myocytes,
although to a much lesser extent than l-type channels (39). in
isolated artery studies using ni2⫹ and  xxxd2638xxx , t-type ca2⫹
channels were implicated in development and maintenance of

physiological data indicating that  xxxg307xxx  t-type ca2⫹ channels
coexist with l-type channels in arteries. several observations
argue against the possibility that our  xxxg307xxx  antibody recognizes l-type or other ( xxxg308xxx ,  xxxg309xxx ) t-type channels. the
antigenic peptide sequence used to produce the  xxxg307xxx  antibody does not occur in any other ca2⫹ channel, hva or lva.
immunoreactivity of the  xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg308xxx  antibodies was
blocked specifically by incubation only with the corresponding
antigenic peptide (i.e.,  xxxg308xxx  peptide did not block  xxxg307xxx 
immunoreactivity). finally,  xxxg307xxx  antibody positively stained
hek 293 cells stably transfected with  xxxg307xxx  but was negative
for hek 293 cells stably transfected with  xxxg308xxx , as well as
untransfected control cells (13).
previously, northern blots showed unusually high levels of
 xxxg308xxx  expression in the kidney (12, 42). because our results
show positive staining for  xxxg307xxx  and negative staining for
 xxxg308xxx  in renal arteries, the high northern blot signal was not
likely due to the vascular component of kidney but may reflect
expression of  xxxg308xxx  channels in the collecting tubules (fig.
3d), where their function is unknown. however, functional
studies using isolated glomerular arterioles implicated the involvement of  xxxg307xxx  in vasoconstriction (17), and  xxxg307xxx 
immunoreactivity in afferent arteriole and glomerular capillaries (fig. 3c) is consistent with these observations.
the expression of the  xxxg307xxx  channel in a7r5 aortic vsm
cells, demonstrated by both immunostaining and rt-pcr, is
supported by positive immunostaining of rat aorta for  xxxg307xxx 
and not  xxxg308xxx . the pattern of  xxxg307xxx  immunoreactivity in
a7r5 cells differs from  xxxg307xxx  staining in neonatal ventricular
myocytes (13). in a7r5 cells, there is a perinuclear concentraajp-heart circ physiol • vol

tion of positive stain, with less labeling of the plasma membrane than might be expected for a voltage-gated ion channel.
this meager plasma membrane staining in a7r5 cells might
explain why t-type currents are not more readily detected in
a7r5 cells and perhaps in other vsm cells. there is precedent
for ca2⫹ current variation in a7r5 cells with growth and
proliferation in culture (22, 36). our immunohistochemical
analysis used confluent cell monolayers similar to those used to
demonstrate ca2⫹ spiking responses to avp. we cannot rule
out the possibility that a different staining pattern might be
observed under different culture conditions.
our pcr results indicated that  xxxg309xxx  mrna is also present
in a7r5 cells; however, the levels relative to  xxxg307xxx  are
considered negligible. because we cannot distinguish  xxxg309xxx 
currents (if present) from  xxxg307xxx  currents in electrophysiological recordings, their functional significance is not known.
we detected both lva and hva components of the endogenous ca2⫹ current in one-third of the a7r5 cells tested, where
lva currents accounted for a significant proportion (⬃25%)
of the total conductance. these currents displayed hallmark
properties of t-type ca2⫹ channels including low-voltage
activation, rapid inactivation, and selective inhibition by  xxxd2638xxx . the ni2⫹ sensitivity of the lva currents was characteristic of  xxxg307xxx  as opposed to the more sensitive  xxxg308xxx 
channels. because  xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg309xxx  share a relatively high
resistance to ni2⫹ (ic50 ⬃200 –250 ␮m vs. ⬃10 ␮m for
 xxxg308xxx ; ref. 25), they cannot be distinguished in these experiments. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that
 xxxg309xxx  currents contribute to the basal lva channel activity in

a7r5 cells, especially because we detected  xxxg309xxx  mrna by
rt-pcr.
published studies on the t-type-selective ca2⫹ channel
blocker  xxxd2638xxx  suggest that t-type ca2⫹ channels may be
a target for its beneficial antihypertensive effects. however,
 xxxd2638xxx  (posicor) was not a successful pharmaceutical for
other (unrelated) reasons (15, 21, 32). even though  xxxd2638xxx 
is not used therapeutically, it remains a useful tool in the
laboratory as a selective blocker of t-type ca2⫹ channels at
low concentrations. in previous studies, we characterized
avp-stimulated ca2⫹ spiking by using a7r5 cells as a model
for vsm (5– 8). in the present study, very low (10 –100 nm)
concentrations of  xxxd2638xxx  had a profound effect on ca2⫹
spiking in this model system, in conditions under which l-type
channel inhibition was highly unlikely. previous studies investigating  xxxd2638xxx  blockade of t-type currents in vsm reported ic50 values in the range of 100 –200 nm (10, 29, 31).
similar sensitivities were reported for the cloned channels
expressed by transfection in hek 293 cells (12, 28, 33, 42).
we clearly demonstrate that, at low concentrations,  xxxd2638xxx  abolishes the avp-stimulated ca2⫹ spiking in a7r5 cells
ajp-heart circ physiol • vol

and ca2⫹ entry via l-type channels is likely unaffected.
although our data indicate that functional t-type ca2⫹ channels are necessary for avp-induced ca2⫹ spiking in a7r5 cells
(fig. 8a), both l- and t-type channels play a passive role in
the avp response, because avp does not directly affect either
l- or t-type ca2⫹ currents in a7r5 cells under voltage-clamp
conditions (ref. 6; brueggemann and byron, unpublished
observations). thus it appears that avp-induced ca2⫹ spiking
reflects a physiological response mediated by a signal transduction pathway that alters membrane potential and thereby
indirectly involves ca2⫹ entry through l- and t-type channels.
dramatic overexpression of t-type channels had no discernable effect on ca2⫹ spiking. it is plausible that, although
necessary, t-type channels are not limiting for the ca2⫹
spiking response to avp.
at a concentration of 100 nm,  xxxd2638xxx  caused a gradual,
but complete, attenuation of avp-stimulated ca2⫹ oscillations. even though we ruled out any effects of  xxxd2638xxx  on
l-type currents to the best of our ability, it is important to note
that  xxxd2638xxx  has only limited selectivity for t-type ca2⫹
channels, and unequivocal assignment of a role for t-type

channels in ca2⫹ spiking will require more specific pharmacological agents or transgenic knockout models.
together our data establish the presence of the t-type ca2⫹
channel  xxxg307xxx  in arterial vsm and suggest that these channels
may contribute to the generation of action potentials in vsm
cells. in vivo, this electrical event might underlie ca2⫹ oscillations related to arterial vasomotion, a physiological process
inherent to the vsm layer of vessel walls (11). this work
contributes to a better understanding of ca2⫹ regulatory mechanisms in vsm, which ultimately could lead to more rational
development of novel classes of antihypertensive drugs.
