abstract
the cardiovascular effects of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine, tacrine and rivastigmine injected by
intravenous ži.v.. route were compared in freely moving wistar rats. the three drugs significantly increased both systolic and diastolic
blood pressure and decreased heart rate. compared to physostigmine, a 20-fold higher dose of tacrine and a 40-fold higher dose of
rivastigmine was necessary to induce a comparable pressor effect. tacrine was chosen as a model to study the mechanisms underlying the
cardiovascular effects of i.v. cholinesterase inhibitors. atropine totally abolished while methylatropine did not affect tacrine pressor
effects. conversely, both drugs abolished tacrine-induced bradycardia. the a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  or the vasopressin v1
receptor antagonist, wb-mercapto-b,b-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, o-me-tyr 2 , arg 8 x vasopressin partially but significantly reduced
tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly. the tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a
dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine žid50 s 1.45 mg., the
muscarinic m 1 receptor antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  žid50 s 4.33 mg., the muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist methoctramine žid50 s 1.39 mg.
and the muscarinic m 3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  žid50 s 31.19 mg.. central injection of such muscarinic
receptor antagonists did not affect tacrine-induced bradycardia. our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant
cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic m 2 receptors inducing a
secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release. conversely, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced bradycardia
appears to be mediated by peripheral muscarinic mechanisms. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
several cholinomimetics are developed or already marketed for the symptomatic treatment of the most common
form of dementia, namely alzheimer’s disease, because it
is believed that a central acetylcholine deficit explains part
of the characteristic memory deficits observed in patients
suffering from this disease žwagstaff and mctavish, 1994..

for example tacrine žtetrahydroaminoacridine. and rivastigmine žsdz ena713., two reversible inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase, have been reported to improve cognitive function and behavioural deficits in patients suffering
from alzheimer’s disease žsummers et al., 1986; davis et
al., 1992. and in animal models of cognitive deficits
žohara et al., 1997..
central cholinergic systems do not only control memory
processes. they are also involved in other important
physiological functions. several experimental arguments
suggest, for example, that acetylcholine participates in the
central control of blood pressure žbrezenoff and giuliano,

1982; buccafusco, 1996.. this central cholinergic pressor
effect is assumed to be mediated, at the periphery, by an
increase in sympathetic tone žkrstic and djurkovic, 1978;
buccafusco and brezenoff, 1979. while the role of a
vasopressin release remains discussed žkawashima et al.,
1986; rascol et al., 1990; savci et al., 1998.. the subtype
of muscarinic cholinoceptors which mediate this central
cholinergic response remains largely debated, some authors having suggested the involvement of m 1 žhori et al.,
¨
1995., m 2 žozkutlu
et al., 1993; ally et al., 1995. or m 3
žmartin, 1992. subtypes. these discrepancies might be due
to differences in species or injection sites.
such cardiovascular cholinergic effects are important to
study because they suggest that there is a risk for potent
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, like those developed for the
treatment of alzheimer’s disease, to induce significant
cardiovascular side effects. indeed, pharmacovigilance
studies have shown that bradycardia is an adverse drug
reaction already reported with tacrine in humans žunpublished data from the french pharmacovigilance database..
recently, a severe increase in blood pressure induced by a
tacrine treatment has also been reported in a patient suffering from alzheimer’s disease žallain et al., 1996.. a
comparable observation has also been reported with
physostigmine žcain, 1986..
the aims of the present study are ž1. to investigate, in
freely moving rats, the cardiovascular changes induced by
an intravenous ži.v.. injection of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: tacrine žbecause it is the first
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor marketed for the treatment of
alzheimer’s disease., physostigmine žbecause it is the
reference acetylcholinesterase inhibitor compound in the
literature. and rivastigmine žbecause it is a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor developed for the treatment of
alzheimer’s disease., and ž2. to identify the central and
peripheral mechanisms involved in this response, looking
for the subtypežs. of cholinoceptoržs. implicated in such
cardiovascular responses and the respective role of the
sympathetic nervous system andror vasopressin release in
mediating these effects.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
experiments were performed on wistar freely moving
male rats weighing 250 to 350 g. these animals were
obtained from iffa credo žl’arbresle, france. and
were maintained at 20–248c with a 12 h light–dark cycle
žlight on 0800–2000 h. at least 1 week before the experiment. food pellets and tap water were available ad libitum.
all animals procedures were conducted in strict compliance with approved french agriculture department for
animal use for research and education groups.

2.2. surgical preparation
2.2.1. peripheral injections
the rats were initially anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone ž60 mg kgy1 i.p.. to insert venous and arterial
catheters allowing subsequent recording of cardiovascular
parameters and drug administration. for this purpose, animals were placed in a blanket, connected to a rectal probe,
to avoid heat loss and body temperature was maintained at
388c žharvard apparatus, england.. the right external
jugular vein and the left carotid artery were cannulated
with a polyethylene catheter žpe-50.. the catheters were
then tunneled subcutaneously to the nape of the neck,
where they were exteriorized. after this, each rat was
allowed at least 2 days to recover. arterial and venous
catheters were kept patent by daily administration of 0.1
ml of heparin ž100 ui mly1 . in 0.9% saline.
2.2.2. intracerebroõentricular injections
the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone
ž60 mg kgy1 i.p.. then the right external jugular vein and
the left carotid artery were cannulated as previously described.
rats were then placed in a stereotaxic frame žunimecanique, paris, france. for central drug administration
and a cannula was implanted, according to the atlas of
paxinos and watson ž1982., in the right lateral cerebroventricle using the following coordinates relative to bregma:
posterior 1.0 mm, lateral 1.5 mm, ventral 4.0 mm from the
surface of the skull. the cannula was connected to a 25 ml
hamilton syringe with polyethylene žpe-50. tubing. the
injection cannula was filled by backfilling with 10 ml of
injectate. the syringe itself was filled with distilled water
and an air bubble was left between water and drug solution.  xxxd2610xxx  was injected i.c.v. after each experiment for verification of the cannula placement and only
proper intracerebroventricular ži.c.v.. placements were included in the study.
2.2.3. cardioõascular parameter-recording
the day of the experiment, arterial and venous catheters
were connected to a pressure transducer and to a syringe,
respectively. then, the rat was left alone in a rodent
sampling cage so that blood pressure could stabilize. blood
pressure was continuously recorded via a pressure transducer žabbott, transpac iv, ireland. and amplifier žbionic
instruments, qazap 94104, france. coupled to a maclab
hardware unit žadinstruments, maclabr4s, australia.
connected to a microcomputer žpowermacintosh 6200,
apple, usa.. heart rate was triggered by the blood pressure signal and expressed in beats per min žbpm.. the
sampling rate was 10 hz and data were collected on a 20 s
period. respiratory rate was also recorded, by observation
of the chest movements, and expressed in breaths per min.

2.3. cardioõascular effects of the three
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
in the first part of this study, we assessed the cardiovascular effects of a bolus i.v. injection of three different
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine ž50 mg
kgy1 ., tacrine ž1 mg kgy1 . and rivastigmine ž2 mg kgy1 .
in freely moving rats. these doses were assessed because
50 mg kgy1 of physostigmine is usually reported to induce
significant cardiovascular effects in the literature
žbrezenoff and giuliano, 1982; oktay et al., 1984; tellioglu et al., 1996.. then, we performed dose–response
experiments to define the dose of tacrine and rivastigmine
which induces cardiovascular changes of the same range
than 50 mg kgy1 of physostigmine žtable 1.. the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor injection was preceded, 5 min
before, by an i.v. saline injection ž0.3 ml. in order to test
non-specific cardiovascular effects. blood pressure, heart
rate and respiratory rate were monitored during 60 min
after administration.
2.4. mechanisms of the cardioõascular effects of tacrine
in order to determine the central andror peripheral
mechanisms underlying the effects of acetylcholinesterase

inhibitors, we tested the pressor response to i.v. tacrine
administration ž1 mg kgy1 . in seven different conditions.
in the ‘saline’ group, the rats received two i.v. injections of a similar volume of saline, in order to evaluate the
effects of repeated systemic injections. the ‘methylatropine’ and ‘atropine’ groups were designed to assess the
involvement of peripheral and central muscarinic receptors
in the tacrine’s effects. the ‘ xxxd3000xxx ’, ‘ vasopressin v1
receptor antagonist’ and ‘prazosinq vasopressin v1 receptor antagonist’ groups were designed to assess the respective involvement of catecholamines and vasopressin release in the pressor response to tacrine. in the ‘chlorisondamine’ group, we assessed the effects of a ganglionic blockade on the tacrine-induced cardiovascular response.
each treatment group was assessed by at least six
separate experiments each in different animals. in the
‘methylatropine’, ‘atropine’, ‘ xxxd3000xxx ’, ‘ vasopressin v1
receptor antagonist’ and ‘chlorisondamine’ groups, each
antagonist was injected by i.v. route 5 min before the
systemic administration of tacrine. in the ‘prazosinq
vasopressin v1 receptor antagonist’ group,  xxxd3000xxx  was
the first drug injected, followed by the vasopressin receptor antagonist and, five min later, tacrine. all cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were measured 1 min
before and 3 min after the i.v. injection of the antagonists

4. discussion
the present study demonstrates that three different
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, namely physostigmine,
tacrine and rivastigmine induced significant changes in
blood pressure and heart rate in freely moving wistar rats
when injected by i.v. route. tacrine being chosen as an
example of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pharmacological family, our results show that the pressor response
to this drug was mediated by the stimulation of central
muscarinic m 2 receptors, inducing a peripheral increase in
both sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release, while its
bradycardic effect was mediated by peripheral muscarinic
mechanisms.
4.1. description and comparison of the cardioõascular
effects induced by the three different acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
4.1.1. pressor effects
at the appropriate dose of 50 mg kgy1 of physostigmine, 1 mg kgy1 of tacrine and 2 mg kgy1 of rivastigmine, the three drugs induced a maximal increase in blood
pressure response of about q30 mm hg. the duration of
these blood pressure responses, also turned out to be

similar with the three drugs, lasting 15 min on average.
however, the onset of the response was quite different,
from one drug to the other, the tacrine response occurring
within a quite short delay žmaximal effect after 1 min.
while that of physostigmine and rivastigmine effects occurred later on: maximal effect after 5 min and 15 min,
respectively žfig. 2.. we have no definite explanation for
these different delays to reach the peak effects with the
three drugs which might involve differences in crossing
blood–brain barrier. nevertheless, these pressor effects of
the three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are in good agreement with what has already been published with other
comparable drugs or cholinomimetic agents žbrezenoff
and giuliano, 1982; buccafusco, 1996..
rivastigmine has recently been claimed to have a larger
therapeutic window than tacrine when treating patients
with alzheimer’s disease žweinstock, 1997.. our data
might support this assumption, although it is difficult to
extrapolate from a single dose study like the present one.
however, one can note that there is an inverse relative
potency of tacrine and rivastigmine when considering their
cognitive and pressor effects. the present data show that
the acute dose of rivastigmine must be twice larger than
that of tacrine to induce the same increase in blood pressure, while previously published data show that the daily
dose of rivastigmine is more than 10-fold smaller than that
of tacrine to induce a clinical improvement on cognitive
functions in patients with alzheimer’s disease. indeed, the
usual recommended daily dose of tacrine is 80 to 160
mgrday žhollister and gruber, 1996. while it is only 6 to
12 mgrday for rivastigmine žsramek et al., 1996.. both
drugs have a comparable oral bioavailability of about 25%
žparnetti, 1995; novartis in-house data.. therefore, differences in peripheral pharmacokinetic mechanisms are unlikely to explain the different relative potencies of both
drugs on both functions. a different ability of the two
drugs to cross the blood–brain barrier cannot either be
advocated because both pressor and cognitive cholinergic
mechanisms are located within the blood–brain barrier.
therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that rivastigmine
might be more effective on cholinergic cognitive central
mechanisms than on pressor ones. indeed, it has been
suggested that rivastigmine has a more selective action on
acetylcholinesterase in the cortex and hippocampus žwhere
cognitive mechanisms may be located. than in the ponsmedulla žweinstock et al., 1986, 1994; weinstock, 1997.,
a brain area where the origin of the cholinergic pressor
response is generally located žbrezenoff and giuliano,
1982.. from a molecular point of view, one can speculate
that the smaller pressor potency of rivastigmine could be
related to its selectivity for the g1 molecular form of brain
acetylcholinesterase, in contrast to physostigmine and
tacrine, which block both g1 and g4 forms with equal
efficiency žweinstock et al., 1994.. however, we are not
aware of any clearly demonstrated topographic differences
in the central distribution of g1 and g4 acetylcholineste-

e. lazartigues et al.r european journal of pharmacology 361 (1998) 61–71

rase forms and no clear link between any specific g form
and different physiological functions have been published
up to now.
4.1.2. effects on heart rate
the systemic injection of the three acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors induced a very similar profile of heart rate
changes from one drug to the other. the three drugs
reduced heart rate with a similar range žy25 bpm on
average., this effect being maximal within the five first
min following the drug injection and lasting less than 10
min. this homogeneity in the heart rate response temporal
profile to the three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, is in
marked contrast with the diversity of the temporal profile
of the pressor response induced by the same three drugs.
this observation suggests that the mechanisms underlying
the pressor and bradycardic responses induced by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors might be independent.
4.2. mechanisms of the acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor-induced cardioõascular changes
4.2.1. pressor effect
according to the similar changes in blood pressure
induced by the three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and in
order to facilitate the experiments, tacrine was chosen as a
model to study the mechanisms governing the cardiovascular effects of i.v. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. the
pressor response to i.v. tacrine was clearly mediated by
central muscarinic cholinoceptors: it was antagonized by
atropine, but not by methylatropine, a drug which does not
cross the blood–brain barrier. the blockade of this response by the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine, can
also be seen as another evidence to involve central mechanisms. this finding is consistent with the well known
central location of the cholinergic systems controlling blood
pressure regulation žbrezenoff and giuliano, 1982.. this
pressor effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may involve various brain areas containing cholinergic neurons
and cardiovascular pathways: the pons–medulla žcaputi et
al., 1980; lee et al., 1991., the hypothalamus žbuccafusco
and brezenoff, 1979; xiao and brezenoff, 1988. or maybe
more rostral brain structures žhori et al., 1995..
the muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine,
was as effective as atropine to prevent the increase in
blood pressure induced by i.v. tacrine. it was 30-fold more
potent than the muscarinic m 3 receptor antagonist, p-fhhsid, but only 3-fold more potent than the muscarinic
m 1 receptor antagonist,  xxxd2965xxx . these findings suggest that central muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptors are mainly
involved in the pressor response to i.v. tacrine. this study,
to our best knowledge, is the first one to test the effects of
different selective antagonists for the three muscarinic
receptor subtypes on blood pressure response in the same
experiment. our data are in agreement with previously
published results involving central muscarinic m 2

69

cholinoceptors in the cardiovascular effects of cholinomimetic drugs in the rat žsundaram et al., 1988, 1989;
¨
ozkutlu
et al., 1993. or the cat žally et al., 1993, 1995..
our results suggest that m 3 cholinoceptors are not involved in this response, in the rat, although conflicting
opinions can be found in the literature žxiao and brezenoff,
1988; brezenoff et al., 1988; martin, 1992; flores et al.,
1996.. such differences may be due to the lack of specificity of some previously used ‘selective’ antagonists like
4-damp ž4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine. or to
differences in central injection sites. the intermediate id50
value obtained, in our study, with the muscarinic m 1
receptor antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  cannot eliminate a weak
involvement of muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptors in the pressor response to i.v. tacrine. moreover, hori et al. ž1995.
showed that the pressor response induced by the intrahippocampal administration of neostigmine in anesthetized
rats was blocked by pretreatment with the muscarinic m 1
receptor antagonist,  xxxd2965xxx . recently, a study conducted in the dog in our laboratory, showed that the
pressor response to i.c. acetylcholine was also blocked by
low doses of  xxxd2965xxx  žpelat et al., 1997..
the present data also demonstrate, as recently published
by savci et al. ž1998., that the blockade of the peripheral
a 1-adrenoceptors by  xxxd3000xxx  resulted in a significant reduction of the tacrine-induced increase in blood pressure.
like these authors, we observed that the tacrine-induced
pressor response was inhibited following the vasopressin
v1 receptor antagonist pretreatment, demonstrating that
vasopressin release also participates in the pressor effect of
tacrine. this result confirms previous studies of our laboratory performed in the dog žrascol et al., 1990; brefel et
al., 1995. showing that plasma levels of noradrenaline,
adrenaline and vasopressin are increased following central
acetylcholine administration and supports the controversial
role of vasopressin in mediating this pressor response
žbuccafusco and brezenoff, 1979; brezenoff and giuliano,
1982; kawashima et al., 1986.. this kind of interactions
between vasopressinergic and cholinergic systems are well
known, indeed, the release of vasopressin is under control
by central cholinergic synapses žkuhn,
1974., however,
¨
the receptors žnicotinic or muscarinic. implicated in this
release in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei are not
clearly identified žbisset and chowdrey, 1984..  xxxd3000xxx 
could also induce a rise in vasopressin plasma levels, when
blood pressure is lowered, reducing the ability of the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to rise blood pressure. although a similar phenomenon was observed in dogs after
administration of sodium nitroprusside žlazartigues et al.,
1998. and in rats made hypotensive by haemorrhage žulus
et al., 1995., this possibility was not tested in the current
experiments. in addition to savci et al. ž1998., our results
also show that the combined pretreatment with an a 1adrenoceptor antagonist and a vasopressin v1 receptor
antagonist nearly completely abolished the pressor response to tacrine while each drug individually only re-

70

e. lazartigues et al.r european journal of pharmacology 361 (1998) 61–71

duced the response by 50% on average. this observation
suggests that noradrenergic and vasopressinergic systems
are the two main efferent systems mediating the central
pressor cholinergic response.
4.2.2. bradycardia
the tacrine-induced bradycardia was clearly abolished
by the peripheral administration of methylatropine and
atropine, but was not influenced by the central administration of atropine or either antagonists. these data demonstrate that peripheral muscarinic mechanisms are involved
in this effect. two other observations are in agreement
with such a peripheral mechanism. the first one is the
chronology of the tacrine-induced bradycardia which occurred before blood pressure increased and disappeared
long before the pressor response ended, suggesting that a
baroreflex phenomenom is unlikely. there was indeed no
parallelism between the temporal profile of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors-induced pressor and bradycardic
responses, further supporting the dissociation of the mechanisms mediating both effects. the second observation is
that bradycardia was not altered by the ganglionic blocker
chlorisondamine. in fact, chlorisondamine rather enhanced
and prolonged the tacrine-induced bradycardia. this phenomenom may be due to the suppression of the tachycardic effects of the sympathetic outflow. our results thus
suggest that tacrine acts on heart rate by potentiating the
postganglionic effects of the parasympathetic system inducing bradycardia via m 2 cardiac receptors.
in conclusion, the present data demonstrate that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular
effects in the conscious rat. these effects consist of a long
lasting increase in blood pressure involving the central
cholinergic system via mainly m 2 and partially m 1 receptors and a bradycardia involving the potentiation of the
peripheral parasympathetic cardiac effects. new compounds, like rivastigmine seem to have a lower propensity
to induce blood pressure changes, in the conscious animal,
as compared with tacrine and physostigmine. cardiovascular side effects may be of clinical relevance in humans,
specially in patients with alzheimer’s disease, who belong
to the elderly population and may suffer from associated
hypertension and mixed, degenerative and vascular dementia. clinical comparative and pharmacovigilance studies
will be necessary to confirm, in treated patients, if the new
generation of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors actually induce fewer cardiovascular side effects than the older ones.
