contrasting effects of n5-substituted tetrahydrobiopterin derivatives on  xxxg1660xxx ,  xxxg1912xxx  and  xxxd2738xxx  syn...  tetrahydrobiopterin [(6r)-5,6,7,8- xxxd3166xxx , h(4)biopterin] is one of several cofactors of  xxxd2738xxx  synthases (ec 1.14.13.39). here we compared the action of n(5)-substituted derivatives on recombinant rat neuronal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase with their effects on  xxxg1912xxx  (ec 1.6.99.7) and  xxxg1660xxx  ( xxxg1660xxx ),the well-studied classical h(4)biopterin-dependent reactions. h(4)biopterin substituted at n(5) with methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl and acetyl groups were used. substitution at n(5) occurs at a position critical to the redox cycle of the cofactor in  xxxg1660xxx / xxxg1912xxx . we also included n(2)'-methyl h(4)biopterin, a derivative substituted at a position not directly involved in redox cycling, as a control. as compared with n(5)-methyl h(4)biopterin, n(5)-formyl h(4)biopterin bound with twice the capacity but stimulated  xxxd2738xxx  synthase to a lesser extent. depending on the substituent used, n(5)-substituted derivatives were redox-active: n(5)-methyl- and n(5)-hydroxyl methyl h(4)biopterin, but not n(5)-formyl- and n(5)-acetyl h(4)biopterin, reduced 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. n(5)-substituted h(4)biopterin derivatives were not oxidized to products serving as substrates for  xxxg1912xxx  and,depending on the substituent, were competitive inhibitors of  xxxg1660xxx : n(5)-methyl- and n(5)-hydroxymethyl h(4)biopterin inhibited  xxxg1660xxx , whereas n(5)-formyl- and n(5)-acetyl h(4)biopterin had no effect. our data demonstrate differences in the mechanism of stimulation of  xxxg1660xxx  and  xxxd2738xxx  synthase by h(4)biopterin. they are compatible with a novel, non-classical, redox-active contribution of h(4)biopterin to the catalysis of the  xxxd2738xxx  synthase reaction.
