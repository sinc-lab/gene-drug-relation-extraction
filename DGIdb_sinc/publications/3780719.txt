the activity of  xxxg649xxx  in rat tissues decreases in the order of lung > kidney > liver-spleen >
other tissues, while aminopeptidase activity is high in the kidney, and lower in the lung than in other tissues.
 xxxg649xxx  was solubilized from the membrane fraction of rat lung by treatment with papain and purified
by deae-cellulose column chromatography, affinity chromatography on concanavalin-a-sepharose and highperformance liquid chromatography gel filtration. the purified preparation was found to be homogeneous on
sodium  xxxd3215xxx /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the relative molecular mass was estimated to be
150000 by gel filtration, comprising a homodimer of two 80000-mr subunits. the enzyme activity was inhibited
by  xxxd1693xxx , o-phenanthroline and atp. this enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of s(substituent)-l-cysteinyl-glycine
adducts such as l-cystinylbis(g1ycine) and  xxxd2684xxx -s-l-cysteinyl-glycine,
as well as the conversion of
leukotriene d4 to f4.furthermore it catalyzed a hydrolytic splitting of  xxxd2460xxx - xxxd2460xxx , but not  xxxd315xxx 
p-nitroanilide, which is a good substrate for aminopeptidase. our enzyme preparation was immunologically
identical to the rat renal  xxxg649xxx . the physiological significance of the pulmonary dehydropeptidase
i on the metabolism of glutathione and its adducts is discussed.
the degradation of reduced and  xxxd2811xxx  and
of glutathione adducts is initiated by y-glutamyl transferase [l,
21, which removes the y-glutamyl moiety to form l-cysteinylglycine( xxxd1788xxx -gly), l-cystinyl-bis(g1ycine) ( ~ - m y s - g l y j
and s (substituent)- xxxd1788xxx -gly adducts, respectively. these
dipeptides or dipeptide adducts are further hydrolyzed by
dipeptidases or by  xxxg163xxx  [3,4].
campbell et al. purified the dipeptidase hydrolyzing
glycyl-dehydrophenylalaninefrom porcine [s - 71 and human
[8] kidneys. recently, it has been reported that this enzyme
specifically hydrolyzes the dehydropeptide bond in carbapenem antibiotics, and it has been referred to as dehydrope tiddse i (dhp-i) [9, 101. we have previously shown that
l- ys ys-gly, and s(substituent)- xxxd1788xxx -gly adducts are
mainly hydrolyzed by the renal dhp-i rather than by
 xxxg163xxx , and we suggested that dhp-i is an important enzyme in the metabolism of glutathione and glutathione
adducts [ill.
in the present study, the tissue distribution of activities of
dhp-i and aminopeptidase in rats was investigated, and
dhp-i was purified from the rat lung, where its specific activity was found to be higher than in the kidney. the immunological identity between pulmonary and renal dhp-i was also
compared using anti-(renal dhp-i) antibody.

analytical procedures

sodium  xxxd3215xxx /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was performed as described by
laemmli [14]. isoelectric focusing electrophoresis was performed with model sj-1070 (atto corporation, japan) using
an ampholine gel plate (ph 3.0-9.5). shodex pac ws-803
(showa denko k.k., japan) was employed for the purification and for the estimation of the molecular mass of the
enzyme using 100 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4), containing 100 mm
nacl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. for reverse-phase hplc a
column of ymc pack a-312 ods (yamamura chemical
laboratories co., ltd., japan) was used. methanol/water/
acetic acid (5:95:0.1, v/v) and methanol/water (30:70, v/v)
plus 0.25% pic a yaters assoc. inc., usa) were used as a
mobile phase for the measurement of malnet-s- xxxd1788xxx -gly
and ~-cyscy~-gly,,
respectively, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min
and the absorbance at 210 nm was monitored. leukotriene

purification of dhp-i from rat lung

results

rat lungs weighing 155 g were homogenized in 3 vol.
50 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4) and centrifuged at 105000 x g for
60 min at 4 "c. the resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 ml
100 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4) and the suspension was incubated
with 1 g papain for 3 h at 37°c. after centrifugation at
105000x g for 60 min, the clear supernatant was fractionated
with ammonium sulfate. the precipitates between 30 -80%
saturation were dissolved with 10 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4) and
dialyzed against the same buffer. the dialysate was applied to
a deae-cellulose column (2.6 x 11 cm)and dhp-i activity
was eluted at nacl concentrations of 0.15 -0.25 m in a linear
gradient in the buffer. the fractions exhibiting dhp-i activity
were pooled and dialysed against 100 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4),
containing 0.2 mm mgci2,0.2 m m caci2and 100 mm nacl
(buffer a). the sample was applied to a cona-sepharose
column (0.9 x 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer a. after
thorough rinsing, the active fraction was eluted with buffer a
containing 20 mg/ml of methyl a-glucoside and finally
purified by hplc (shodex pac ws-803). table 1 represents,
a summary of the purification procedures. the final preparation was purified about 2200-fold based on the activity in
homogenates with a recovery of 45.0%.

physicochemical properties of the purified dhp-i

dhp-i and aminopeptidase activities were determined in
various tissues from rats. the dhp-i activity was highest
in the lung followed by kidney, spleen and liver, brain and
pancreas, and small intestine (fig. 1). the specific activity in
the lung was more than twice that in the kidney. amino-

the analysis by sds-page showed that the purified
enzyme preparation contained one single protein (fig. 2 a)

preparation of antibody against renal dhp-i

dhp-i from rat kidney was purified as described previously [ll]. antisera against the rat renal dhp-i were
obtained from rabbits by the technique of noshiro and omura
[i71 as follows. the purified enzyme (0.25 mg) was emulsified
with freund's complete adjuvant (sigma chemical co., usa)
and administered by subcutaneous injection. after 3 weeks,
0.13 mg enzyme in saline was injected into an ear vein. seven
days later the rabbits were killed by exsanguinating from
the jugular vein. the antisera were precipitated with 33%
saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by passage through a
deae-cellulose (de-52) column to obtain the igg fraction.

applied. protein was stained with coomassie brilliant blue r-250. double-immunodiffusion tests were carried out in 1 yoagarose gel. the
amounts employed of anti-(renal dhp-i) antibody, purified pulmonary and renal dhp-i were 80 pg, 12 pg and 4 pg protein, respectively

ferent isoelectric points may be attributed to a difference in
the extent of sialylation of the enzyme [18], which is known
to be a glycoproteinbecause of its binding to con-a-sepharose
in the purification.
the ph optimum of the enzyme was 7.4. the catalytic
activity increased with rinsing temperature from 30°c to
60 "c.

the result of the immunodiffusion experiment is shown in
fig. 2b. the anti-(renal dhp-i) antibody reacted with the
pulmonary dhp-i as well as with the renal enzyme, the two
precipitation lines fusing completely. the results of the
immunotitration tests are shown in fig. 3. 10 pg of the anti(renal dhp-i) antibody completely inhibited 1 pg of both
pulmonary and renal dhp-i, the profiles of the two titration
curves being almost identical. it seems, therefore, that this
antibody has the same specificity for both renal and pulmonary dhp-i, which strongly indicates immunological identity
of both enzymes.

the hydrolyzing activities and the kinetic parameters of
dhp-i toward different substrates are listed in table 3. a
high activity was seen with s(substituent)- xxxd1788xxx -glyadducts,
such as l-c~~cys-giy,
and malnet-s- xxxd1788xxx -gly.  xxxd2460xxx -lleu, a common substrate for dipeptidase [12, 201, was also

in the present report, the distribution of dhp-i activity
was compared with that of aminopeptidase activity. the
highest activity of dhp-i was demonstrated in the rat lung.
this distribution profile was clearly different from that of
aminopeptidase activity, which was highest in the kidney,
and was also different from that of the dipeptidase activity
hydrolyzing  xxxd2460xxx - xxxd2460xxx  [12].
in a previous paper [ill, we proposed that renal dhp-i
could function as an enzyme in the metabolism of glutathione
and its adducts. in order to compare the enzymatic nature of
pulmonary dhp-i with that of the purified renal enzyme,
purification and characterization of the enzyme from lung
was performed. dhp-i of both organs was shown to be
immunologically identical and to have similar catalytic
properties, molecular mass and ph optimum. the activity of
the pulmonary enzyme was inhibited by o-phenanthroline, a
metal-chelating agent, which suggests that this enzyme also
contains a metal in the active site like the renal dhp-i [7].
 xxxd3463xxx , a specific inhibitor for  xxxg163xxx , exerted
only weak inhibition on the activity of dhp-i, while s-benzyll-cysteine p-nitroanilide, a substrate for  xxxg163xxx 
[21], was not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. these observations
show that pulmonary dhp-i is a different enzyme from
 xxxg163xxx .
griffith et al. [22] and ormstad et al. [23] reported that lw y s - g l y , is a main renal metabolite of glutathione in vivo,
and our previous results showed that the renal dhp-i
hydrolyzed this substrate [ll]. in the present study, it was also
found that pulmonary dhp-i hydrolyzed l - c ~ ~ c y s - g ~ y ~
very efficiently. these results, therefore, indicate that pulmonary dhp-i may have an important role in whole-body
glutathione metabolism.
in addition, leukotriene d4, an s (substituent)- xxxd1788xxx -gly
derivative of  xxxd208xxx , was hydrolyzed by the rat

525
pulmonary dhp-i at low substrate concentrations (below
20 pm). recently, it was reported that leukotriene d4 was
converted to e4 by lung homogenate of guinea pigs [24].
from these results, it is conceivable that pulmonary dhp-i is
involved in pulmonary metabolism of leukotrienes.
rutenburg et al. [25]showed that y-glutamyltransferase is
located in the bronchial epithelium of the lung. high activity
of dhp-i in the lung may indicate that the lung is a
physiologically important organ for the metabolism of not
only gutathione and its adducts but also of leukotrienes.
we wish to express our thanks to dr. keisuke murayama, the
director of the research institute of sankyo co. ltd, and dr. hideyo
shindo, the director of the analytical and metabolic research laboratories of this company, for their kind encouragement.
