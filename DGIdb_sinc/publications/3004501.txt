abstract- xxxd1879xxx 
inhibited the formation of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in rat basophil
leukemia (rbl) cells (50% inhibitory concentration, ecus,3 mm). similar concentrations also inhibited
the formation of leukotriene c, (ltc,) by ltc synthetase, a detergent-solubilized cell free particulate
enzyme from rbl cells which is capable of coupling  xxxg1346xxx  to glutathione. by contrast, the conversion
of  xxxg1346xxx  to ltc4 using enzymes from rat liver was at least ten times less sensitive to this inhibitor. the
ec50 for inhibition of the leukotriene c synthetase of rbl cells was directly proportional to the  xxxg1346xxx 
concentration in the incubations, ranging from 1.5 mm  xxxd1891xxx  ,&i  xxxg1346xxx  to over 40 mm at 500 fm lta+
kinetic analysis revealed that the in~bition of the leukotriene c synthetase reaction by  xxxd1879xxx  was competitive with respect to lta+ in contrast to diethylcarbam~ne,
piriprost (u60,257; 6,9-dee~xy-6,9-(phenyli~no)-a6,8-prostaglandin
ii), which inhibits the formation of sulfidopeptide leuktrienes in rbl cells at the s-lipoxygenase step (ec& pi@, did not inhibit the leukotriene
synthetase of these cells. on the other hand, low concentrations of piriprost, which had no demonstrable
inhibitory activity on leukotriene formation by themselves, markedly synergized the inhibitory activity
of  xxxd1879xxx .
these results are consistent with the interpretation that both piriprost and
 xxxd1879xxx  inhibit leukotriene formation but that they act on sequential steps in the biosynthetic
pathway in such a manner as to synergistically interfere with the availability or utilization of ltap in
the leukotriene c synthetase reaction:

the observation that  xxxd1879xxx 
(dec) can
inhibit the formation of slow-reacting substance of
anaphylaxis (srs-a; [l]) predates the determination
of the structure of the leukotrienes (lt) by at least 10
years and was initially based on somewhat anecdotal
clinical observations, suggesting that this antifilarial
agent had beneficial effects with respect to the
asthma of a patient who also had filariasis [2]. after
the structures of the leukotrienes became known,
there developed a concerted effort to find selective
inhibitors of their formation and it was not surprising
that dec once again received attention [3]. one of
the publications which resulted from this renewed
interest f4] suggested that extremely low concentrations of dec inhibited the formation of both
ltb4 and the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in mastocytoma cells while actuaily stimulating the formation
of 5-hydroxyei~osatetraenoic
acid (5hete),
suggesting that the site of action of dec in inhibiting
leukotriene formation may be the leukotriene a4
synthetase reaction.
we were interested in finding out whether dec
might also inhibit the conversion of  xxxg1346xxx  to ltc4
by the solubilized leukotriene c synthetase which
we had been studying [s]. this paper describes the
results of our experiments and demonstrates that
dec is a competitive inhibitor with respect to  xxxg1346xxx 
in the leukotriene c synthetase reaction.

sulfonic acid (hepes), ph 7.01 were distributed
after a brief preincubation at 30” (0.2 ml/tube) into
12 x 75 mm plastic culture tubes which contained
0.2 ml of the same buffer containing double strength
inhibitor solutions. after 2.5 min of further incubation, 50 ~1 of a neutralized 0.1 m cysteine solution
was added to each tube, and this was followed in
another 2.5 min by 50 ~1 of a 120 m/ml solution of
the calcium ionophore. incubation was continued for
20min at which time the reaction was stopped by
chilling the tubes in an ice bath and adding 2 ml per
tube of absolute methanol to dissociate any bound
leukotrienes and to precipitate the proteins. after
standing (30 min, 0’) supernatant fractions were collected by centrifugation, were dried under vacuum at
45” in a speed vat concentrator (savant instruments
inc., hicksville, ny), and were stored at -80” until
assay.
the ltc synthetase was solubilized from the high
speed particulate fraction of rbl cell homogenates
using 0.3% triton x-100 and assayed as previously
described [s, 91. briefly, reaction mixtures (0.45 ml)
consisting of solubilized enzyme, 3mm gsh and
inhibitors in suspen~ng
buffer (137mm nacl,
2.6 mm kci, 0.36 mm nah2p0.,, 10 mm hepes,
1 mm edta, ph 7.0) were equilibrated at 37” for
2 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding 50 ~1
of 0.1 mm  xxxg1346xxx , lithium salt in suspending buffer
which also contained 10 mg/ml of bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). incubations were continued for 10 min
since we have reported previously that the reaction
was linear for this period [5]. in certain experiments
where the effect of the  xxxg1346xxx  concentration on leukotriene generation was to be measured, the incubations were scaled down to a volume of 0.1 ml in
order to conserve substrate, in these experiments,
the final bsa ~ncen~ation
was increased to
10 mg/ml because prelimin~
results had shown that
this was necessary to achieve a good dependence
on the ltal dose. incubations were stopped as
described above. after drying, the samples were
rehydrated to their original volume and applied to
300 @ microcolumns of dowex 50 (h+). the columns
were extensively washed with water and with 80%
aqueous methanol,
and the sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes were eluted in 5% aqueous pyridine [5].
the samples were again dried to remove the pyridine
and were bioassayed after rehydration for ltc4 on
the guinea pig ileum using synthetic leukotriene reference standards. the reference standard was ltc4
when ltc synthetase assays were performed and a
mixture of equal parts of ltc4 and ltd4 when
samples from incubations
of intact cells were
assayed. recovery of synthetic ltc4 through this
procedure was 20.6 * 1.4% (s.e.m.) for samples
containing l-20 ng ltc+
in certain experiments, the production of ltc4
and ltd4 was monitored by two newly-developed
radioimmunoassays
(g. j. white, personal communication). both assays are based on the use of
rabbit antisera which are selective for the respective
leukotriene or group of leukotrienes.
cross-reactivity to other sulfidopeptide leukotrienes was as
follows: anti-ltc,, less than 10% for ltd4 and less
than 1% for lte4; anti-ltd1, about 14% for ltc4
and 79% for lte4. the assay procedure has been

described previously [lo] and is based on the sequestration of bound leukotrienes
by dextran-coated
charcoal at the end of the incubation.
isolation and characterization of rat liver glutathione s-transferuses. the procedures employed for

the isolation of the  xxxg1073xxx  (gsh
st) fractions from rat liver cytosol have been
described elsewhere [ll]. briefly, gsh st activity
in the 100,~ g supernatant fraction from rat liver
homogenates was isolated by adso~tion to and elution from glutathionyl sepharose and was then fractionated by serial chromatofocusing
at increasing
ph. the fractions which were eluted were characterized for their activity using both dncb and
dcnb [12], and the fraction which was primarily
used in the present studies (elution peak centering
on ph 9.0) defined a peak of activity in which biologic
activity with the two substrates and adsorption in
the ultraviolet at 280 nm appeared to coincide. the
particulate gsh st from rat liver was a suspension
of a washed microsomal fraction which was isolated
between 20,000 and 100,000 g, and which was stored
at -80” beween uses. protein concentrations were
dete~ined
by a method employing a folin-ciocalteau reagent [13].
kinetic studies and statistical treatment of the
results. it was necessary to normalize the results from

ltc synthetase assays before they could be used for
kinetic analysis. to accomplish this, the results for
all the inhibitor concentrations
in a given experiment, for which activity fell between 15 and 85% of
control (the linear portion of the log dose vs response
plot), were used to compute the regression line for
this relationship by the method of least squares.
normalized values for the extent of inhibition at each
of the inhibitor concentrations that had been used
were then interpolated from this regression curve
and were used for the kinetic estimates. this method
permitted us to reduce the scatter in the experimental
points by relying on all the values on the curve rather
than having to rely on the individual values with their
larger associated errors. the same procedure was
also used to obtain estimates of the 50% inhibitor
concentration (et&).
the evaluation of the kinetics of the inhibition of
the gsh sts was carried out under conditions where
one of the substrates (gsh) was present at saturating
concentration
and the concentration of the other
substrate was varied around the apparent k,. the
results were analyzed by the method of lineweaver
and burk 1141.
tests for synergism were carried out with intact
rbl cells which were incubated, simult~eously,
with various concentrations of both dec and piriprost. the presence of synergism in any given combination of the two inhibitors was established qualitatively as follows: inhibition was expressed as the
percent of control leukotriene
synthesis activity
which was found in the presence of any given inhibitor or combination
of inhibitors. the predicted
activity of a given combination is the geometric sum
of the activities of the inhibitors used singly. therefore, if the observed

there was a direct correlation between the ecus and

before a more careful kinetic analysis could be

the activity of the solubilized ltc synthetase of
rbl cells in the presence of a saturating (3 mm)

apparent k,,, was approximately 0.1 mm.
experiments were therefore designed to measure
the kinetics of the inhibition of the ltc synthetase
reaction by dec at lta, concentrations which were

near the apparent km rather than at the 10 ,um concentration which we employ for routine assays of this
enzyme. a lineweaver-burk plot of the results from
two such experiments is shown in fig. 4. the lines
defined by the double reciprocals of the data points
(regression coefficient 0.98 or greater) all intersect
on the ordinate, suggesting that the inhibition was
competitive. a secondary plot of the slope of these
lines against the concentration
of dec defines a
straight line (regression coefficient of 0.979) and an
estimated k, of 3.75 mm. it was not possible to

synergism between dec and piriprost. it seemed
to us that the weak inhibitory activity of dec might
be enhanced if this inhibitor were combined with
another agent which would reduce the amount of
 xxxg1346xxx  available to the ltc synthetase of the challenged cells. an inhibitor of the 5lipoxygenase
would be expected to have this effect. we chose
piriprost as a model inhibitor since it is known to
affect the formation of 5-hete, ltb4 and the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes [ 151 but not other branches
of the  xxxd208xxx  cascade. furthermore, studies
in human neutrophils have suggested that piriprost
is an inhibitor of the  xxxg147xxx  [19]. we therefore set up experiments to test the effects of combinations of dec and piriprost on the formation of
sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in ionophore-challenged
rbl cells. table 1 presents the averaged results of
two such experiments in which the same inhibitor
concentrations were tested. the agreement between
the results of the two experiments was within 10%.
it will be noted that concentrations of piriprost which
had no significant effect on the generation of leukotrienes by themselves markedly potentiated
the
inhibitory activity of dec in this system. indeed,
the observed activities of the combinations of the
two drugs were greater than the predicted activity of
the sum of the two drugs in all of the combinations
which are shown in the table.
we were interested in determining whether the
observed synergism was expressed primarily by one
of these drugs acting on the second or whether the
effects were actually bi-directional. to gain some
insight into this, we recalculated the results in table
1, expressing the activities in the tubes which contained mixtures of the two drugs relative to the
activity when either drug in the mixture was present
by itself. table 2 summarizes the activities relative
to those in the absence of piriprost but in the presence
of increasing concentrations of dec, and table 3
summarizes the activities relative to those in the
absence of dec but in the presence of increasing
concentrations of piriprost. these relative activities
permit the calculation of the apparent ecso values
for each inhibitor in the presence of increasing concentrations of the other, and these ec50 values are
also shown in the tables. it will be noted that, while
increasing concentrations of dec had little effect on
the ecso for piriprost, increasing concentrations of
piriprost had a profound effect on the ec& for dec.
this is shown in fig. 5 where the ratios of the ecso

values in the absence of the second inhibitor to those
in its presence are plotted against the concentration
of the second inhibitor. both interactions resulted in
changes in ec50 which best fit a log-log plot, but the
range of changes in the ecso for piriprost did not
exceed lo-fold, while the potentiation of the action
of dec was greater than loo-fold at the highest
piriprost concentration.
a corollary to our interpretation,
that the synergism between piriprost and dec is due to the
inhibitory activities of these compounds on different
steps in the sequence leading to the biosynthesis of
leukotrienes, is that there should not be any syn-

ergism manifested by combinations
of dec and
piriprost in the ltc synthetase reaction. table 4
shows the results of an experiment in which this
possibility was tested. it is clear that, if anything,
there was a slight antagonism rather than a synergism
between these inhibitors.
validation of the bioassay procedure. one of the
shortcomings of the quantitation of results by bioassay employing the guinea pig ileum is the everpresent danger that the inhibitors which are being
studied might interfere with the bioassay. this could
take at least two forms. the inhibitors might affect
the response of the bioassay or they might influence

rbl cells were incubated with combinations of dec and piriprost of various
concentrations and challenged with the calcium ionophore in the presence of cysteine.
see materials and methods for details. the results represent the averages of duplicate
incubations in two independent experiments and are expressed relative to the uninhibited controls which are taken as 100%. the “predicted” activity in the presence of
the combinations is obtained by deriving the least square line for the log of the
concentration against activity for the inhibitors taken singly, and then forming the
product, [(%control),* (%control)a], where a and b are piriprost and dec respectively. the table gives the ratio of the observed activity to the predicted activity. values
that are smaller than 1.0 indicate the presence of synergism. uninhibited leukotriene
production was 0.56 nmole ltd4 equivalents/lo6 cells.

the data are taken from table 1. for each concentration of dec, the activity in the
absence of piriprost was taken as loo%,htiv~and the activity in the presence of combinations of piriprost and dec was then expressed relative to this value. these activities
were then used to compute the f.v&,for piriprost at the respective concentrations of dec
by the method of least squares. the regression coefficients for these computed lines are
also shown.

the conversion of ltc to ltd and of ltd to lte
so that the differenti~ sensitivity of the bioassay to
these substances [20] might result in apparent
changes in the total amount of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes which was produced when, in fact, there was
merely a shift in the relative proportions of these
substances. we eliminated the first of these pitfalls
by demonstrating that there was no interference in
the bioassay when dec, piriprost, or combinations
of these were present in the samples to be assayed.
we sought to eliminate the second possibility by
examining the effect of the inhibitors, singly or in
combination,
on the ratios of the sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes which were produced by means of selective radioimmunoassays.
we employed dec concentrations of 0.77, 2.7 and 7.7mm and piriprost

concentrations of 2.3 and 7.0@4. in addition, we
studied the combination of 1 @i piriprost with the
dec concentrations above. through all these conditions, the molar ratio of ltc to (ltd plus lte)
was 2.08 _t 0.23 (s.d.). it is theoretically possible to
estimate the lte concentration
by solving simultaneous equations using the cross reactivity of the
antibody to ltd and the relative activities of the
three leukotrienes in the bioassay. however, when
we used the conversion constants which we had
determined on numerous occasions ([21]; 31.2 units/
pmole for ltc, 62 units/pmoie for ltd and 21.1
unitsj’pmole for lte), only uninterpretable
results
were obtained. we suspect that this may be due to
interference between the leukotrienes in the bioassay
when they are present as a mixture.

for each concentration of piriprost, the activity in the absence of dec was taken
as loo%,h,ivcand the activity in the presence of combinations of piriprost and dec
was then expressed relative to this value. these activities were then used to compute
the ecus for dec at the respective concentrations of piriprost by the method of
least squares. the regression coefficients for these computed lines are also shown.

discussion

this paper
demonstrates

addresses two related issues. first, it
that dec, which has been known to

inhibit the synthesis of srs-a for many years [l], is
an inhibitor of the terminal step in the synthesis of
the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes.
second, it shows
that this activity of dec can be markedly potentiated
by the simultaneous presence in the incubations of
loy doses of piriprost, a compound which has been
reported to be a selective inhibitor of the 5lipoxygenase.
the paper also addresses two ancillary questions
which, while they may be of some interest in their
own right, are necessary for the validation of the
main points of this paper. these are first, the vali-

431

dation of the assay procedures which were employed
and, second, the examination of the selectivity of
action of dec for the ltc synthetase compared to
other gsh sts.
one of the perennial
issues which must be
addressed in any study of inhibitors is that of possible
trivial explanations for the observed inhibition. in
our case, where the quantitation of the leukotrienes
was based on bioassay results, this is particularly
important since compounds which interfere with the
assay might be confused with compounds which
interfere in the biosynthesis of the mediators. thus,
testing for such interference in the assay has become
a routine procedure. the possibility of a more subtle
interference, for example, by shifting the ratios of
the three sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, is much more
difficult to exclude until truly selective assays of
sufficient sensitivity for the individual components
of the mixture become available. we are only able
to do this in part at the moment since we do not yet
have selective assays for ltd and lte and can only
measure the concentration of a mixture of the two.
our results, thus far, make it unlikely, however, that
shifts in the proportions of the three sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes could explain the observed results.
the results presented in this paper clearly indicate
that dec is an inhibitor of the ltc synthetase of
rbl cells. it differs from other inhibitors of this
enzyme which we have examined, such as  xxxd3255xxx  [9], in that it appears to be more selective
toward the ltc synthetase of rbl cells compared
to the gsh sts in rat liver, whereas the selectivity
of all the other inhibitors we have examined thus far
was in the opposite direction [16]. the ability to
identify selective inhibitors of ltc synthetase is of
potential practical importance since one would not
wish to encumber potential therapeutically-useful
inhibitors of leukotriene production with the hepatotoxicity which might accompany the inhibition of the
hepatic gsh sts.
the question therefore arises if the observed inhibition of ltc synthetase by dec is sufficient to
account for the inhibition of leukotriene formation
in the intact rbl cells. we cannot rule out an effect
of dec on the 5lipoxygenase or, perhaps, on the
lta synthetase as suggested by mathews and murphy [4], but the similarity in ecso values for inhibition
of leukotriene
