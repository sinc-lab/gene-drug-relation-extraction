abstract
background: inhaled  xxxd2738xxx  (ino) is proposed in the management of pulmonary hypertension (ph) in patients undergoing cardiac
surgery. secondary ph related to a long-standing heart valve disease however may be refractory to ino. aim of this prospective study was to
determine whether the combination of ino plus  xxxd1914xxx  (dp), a  xxxd1274xxx -specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor
(pde5), may enhance and/or prolong the response to ino in adult patients with secondary valve-related ph undergoing cardiac surgery, and
attenuate rebound events related to its discontinuation.
methods: responses in 27 patients, 11 male, mean age 72f11 years, with ph due to mitral and/or aortic valve disease, were studied in the
intensive care unit after cardiac surgery, during sedation and stable hemodynamic conditions. the effect of isolated ino administration (40
ppm), ino combined with dp (0.2 mg/kg i.v.), and dp alone (1 mg/kg/24 h) on pulmonary vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery
pressure, cardiac index, mixed venous o2sat%, and mean arterial pressure were determined.
results: all patients showed at least a 10% decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance vs. baseline after administration of ino [responders].
inhaled no and the combination of ino/dp produced a reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure
( pb0.05). cardiac index improved with a significant difference between ino and the association ino/dp versus baseline ( pb0.05). this
significant hemodynamic improvement versus baseline was maintained during isolated dp administration ( pb0.05), but not during isolated
ino discontinuation. mixed venous oxygen saturation showed an overall improvement of 17% ( pb0.05).
conclusions: inhaled no and dp infusion might represent a valuable association in the management of ph secondary to a heart valve
disease in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. their beneficial hemodynamic effects might be particularly valuable in the management of
patients with associated right ventricular dysfunction.

1. introduction
increased pulmonary artery pressure (pap) and vascular
resistance (pvr) may worse operative mortality after
cardiac surgery by determining right ventricular dysfunction
thus compromising cardiac output [1].

 xxxd2738xxx  (no) is an endothelial-derived relaxing
factor which modulates basal tone and influences vasoreactivity in the pulmonary vascular bed. no lowers pvr by
stimulating soluble  xxxg1587xxx  in pulmonary vascular
smooth muscle to produce 3v,5v- xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp), which in turn produces vascular smooth
muscle relaxation. pulmonary vascular tone depends greatly
on cgmp concentration which is determined by the balance
of its production by  xxxg1587xxx  and degradation by
cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase (pde5) (fig. 1).

fig. 1. inhaled into the alveolus, no diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane and activates  xxxg1587xxx  to generate cyclic guanine 3v,5v
monophosphate (cgmp). pulmonary vasorelaxation is mediated through cgmp which then undergoes degradation by the cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase
enzymes (pde5), thus showing a mean half-life of less than 1 min. diffused into the blood vessel lumen, no is bound to hemoglobin (hb) and inactivated.
hemoglobin converts to nitrosyl-hemoglobin, to methemoglobin (met-hb), and then to nitrates and nitrites by methemoglobin reductase found in erythrocytes.
with exposure to oxygen, no is oxidized to no2 which is very cytotoxic because it is rapidly converted by water in nitric acid and peroxynitrite which then
rapidly promote cytotoxic effects.

experimental work suggests that endogenous no activity (and thus cgmp production) is attenuated in some
models of ph and also in clinical pulmonary hypertension
[2–4]. in addition, persistent or increased pde5 activity
contributes to increased pulmonary vascular tone in adult
rats exposed to chronic hypoxia [5]. thus, the high resting
pulmonary vascular tone and altered vasoreactivity that
characterize clinical pulmonary hypertension may reflect
decreased endogenous no production and/or increased or
persistent pde5 activity [6].
in clinical practice, inhaled  xxxd2738xxx  (ino) has been
utilized as a selective pulmonary vasodilator in patients
undergoing cardiac operation with evidence of secondary
ph [1,7–9]. responsiveness to ino therapy however
appeared to be quite variable, with some patients having
limited or transient hemodynamic improvement.
the possibility to increase cgmp production by ino and
to reduce its breakdown by pde5 inhibitors (zaprinast,
 xxxd1914xxx ) has been tested in animal and clinical trials in
the past [1,6–11]. data from clinical studies however
showed often significant limitations in view of the small
number of patients enrolled and of the definition of ph.
moreover, very few observations dealt with the issue of ph
control by ino after routine cardiac surgery in adults
[1,12,13].
aim of our study was to determine whether the combined
use of ino, associated and followed by the administration

of the specific pde5-inhibitor  xxxd1914xxx  (dp), to
prevent cgmp breakdown, had any clinical advantage
compared to the use of ino alone in adult patients with a
heart valve disease and associated long-standing ph in the
immediate post-operative course following cardiac surgery.
the observation was also devoted to evaluate the potential
of dp to mitigate the reported clinical effect related to ino
abrupt discontinuation (rebound ph).
 xxxd1914xxx  was chosen in view of its known pde5
inhibitory activity, excellent safety profile in humans, and
prompt commercial availability.

2. materials and methods
the following study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the ethical committee of the university of
verona on the 5th of april, 2000.
between may 2000 and december 2002, 27 patients, 11
males and 16 females with a mean age of 72f11 years
(range, 52–79 years) with pulmonary hypertension (defined
as a mean pulmonary artery pressure n35 mm hg, and/or a
transpulmonary gradient n10 mm hg) secondary to a mitral
and/or aortic valvular disease were proposed for surgical
repair and thus enrolled in this study after informed consent
was obtained from each patient. patients with reactive
airways disease requiring chronic bronchodilator or anti-

inflammatory therapy and patients with intracardiac shunts
were excluded.
patients’ main characteristics and hemodynamic variables are reported in tables 1 and 2.
all patients were operated on with standard cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia (28–30 8c).
myocardial protection was achieved with blood cardioplegia
delivered antegrade, or antegrade and retrograde. valve
implantation in all positions was accomplished following
standard surgical technique [14]. in patients undergoing
mitral valve replacement, the posterior mitral leaflet and its
insertion to the papillary muscles were preserved whenever
possible, to maintain left ventricular geometry and enhance
function. intraoperative variables, including associated
procedures, are reported in table 3.
the study protocol for collection of data proceeded in the
intensive care unit as soon as the patient achieved stable
hemodynamic conditions, as deemed by the attending
surgeon, and in all cases within 3 h since arrival. patients
requiring inotropic support more than dopamine or dobutamine 3 g/kg/min, or depending on external pacing were not
included.
monitoring in each patient was obtained with a five-lead
electrocardiogram, a radial arterial line and a swan–ganz
catheter introduced through the right internal jugular vein. a
left atrial pressure monitoring catheter was also routinely
introduced in the operative room into the left atrium via the
right superior pulmonary vein after weaning the patient from
cardiopulmonary bypass [15]. collection of data took place
while the patient was sedated and paralyzed, mechanically
ventilated with a tidal volume at about 10 ml/kg and a
respiratory rate adjusted to achieve an arterial carbon
dioxide tension (pco2) of about 40 mm hg. arterial
oxygen tension (po2) was maintained at greater than 150
mm hg, and arterial ph at about 7.42. positive endexpiratory pressure at a level of 3 cm h2o was administered
in all patients. ventilatory patterns were not modified during
collection of data to avoid any influence on pulmonary
vascular tone.

thermodilution cardiac outputs were obtained by the
injection of 10 ml of iced 5% dextrose in water in b6 s
performed by a single operator (s.a.) at end-expiration.
five measurements were obtained, with the first being
discarded. the mean was calculated from the other four
measurements and used in the subsequent analysis. thermodilution technique was preferred over fick method for
logistic reasons.
inhaled no was supplied in tanks (air-liquide sanitá
s.p.a., milano, italy) and administered into the inspiratory
arm of the anesthesia breathing circuit. concentration of
ino and no2 was continuously monitored at the inspiratory and expiratory limb of the patient ventilatory system
by a noxbox (bedfont instruments, upchurch, uk).
methemoglobin concentrations were measured at baseline
and every 10 min after the first exposure to ino, with a
radiometer abl 700 blood gas analyzer (copenhagen,
denmark).
the study protocol followed two stages (fig. 2). during
the first one, after determining baseline hemodynamic
variables (time: 0 min), 40 ppm of no were added to the
ventilatory circuit for 10 min. then, hemodynamic variables
were determined (time: 10 min), and again re-determined
after 10 min since ino discontinuation (time: 20 min).
during the second stage, 40 ppm of no were again added to
the ventilatory circuit but associated to the administration of
dp (0.2 mg/kg intravenously); hemodynamic variables were

discontinued and dp infused continuously (1 mg/kg/24 h);
hemodynamic variables were then re-determined after 10
min (time: 40 min). the second stage of the protocol was
undertaken only in patients showing at least a 10% decrease
in pvr versus baseline after administration of ino [time: 10

2.1. statistical analysis
all continuous variables are presented as meanfstandard

3. results
all the 27 patients enrolled in the study completed the
protocol. fig. 3 illustrates the effects observed during the
test on pulmonary and systemic pressure, pvr, mixed
venous oxygen saturation, and cardiac index. all collected
post-operative values and results of statistical analysis are
reported in table 5.
overall, ino and the combination ino/dp produced a
statistically significant reduction of pvr (27.5% vs. baseline, and 34% vs. baseline, respectively; pb0.05) and mean
pulmonary artery pressure (17% vs. baseline, and 14% vs.
baseline, respectively; pb0.05). pulmonary vascular resistance continued to decline during isolated infusion of dp
( pb0.05 vs. baseline); this difference was statistically
significant also when compared to isolated ino, and d/c
ino ( pb0.05)(fig. 3, table 5). mixed venous oxygen
saturation showed a continuous improvement versus baseline during the study protocol, which reached at best a 17%
increment (dp vs. baseline; pb0.05).
cardiac index improved during the study protocol, with
a significant difference between ino alone and the
association ino/dp, versus baseline [( pb0.05); fig. 3].
this significant hemodynamic improvement versus baseline was also maintained during the continuous administration of dp alone ( pb0.05), but not during isolated ino
discontinuation. the difference was statistically significant
also when dp was compared to isolated ino, and d/c ino
( pb0.05). after infusion of dp, heart rate and stroke

respectively) (table 5).
there were no significant changes during the trial in
values of arterial ph, arterial po2, arterial pco2, and central
venous pressure. mean systemic arterial pressure showed a
trend towards a slight reduction after dp administration
(n=9 patients; 33%), although statistically nonsignificant.
none of the patients in the all group required volume and/or
inotropic adjustment during the trial.
methemoglobin concentration was monitored throughout
the study at each time frame, with a recorded mean highest
value of 1.7f0.3%. none of the patients showed clinical
signs of toxicity.
all patients in this series were successfully weaned from
the ventilatory support after a mean time of 21f11 h. mean
intensive care unit stay was 47f19 h. they were all
discharged to a rehabilitation unit after 9f1 days.

4. discussion
pulmonary hypertension may significantly complicate
the perioperative management of patients undergoing
operation for heart valve diseases. in this setting the
mechanism of ph depends on a chronically increased left
atrial pressure due to the valve disease itself and/or some
degree of left ventricular impairment, on the vascular
remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature in response to
chronic obstruction to pulmonary venous drainage, and
finally on pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction [1,16]. these
baseline conditions often worsen immediately after surgery
as a consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass due to an
exaggerated response to vasoconstricting agonist [1].
the potential benefits of ino in the clinical setting of
hypoxemic respiratory failure and the management of
secondary ph in cardiac surgery were reported in the

162

f. santini et al. / international journal of cardiology 103 (2005) 156–163

english literature since the early 1990s and extensively
throughout the last decade [4,7–9,12,13,17–23]. among
different possible acting mechanisms, it was also considered
that an initial exogenous dose of ino might compensate for
the demonstrated diminished expression of endothelial no
activity of pulmonary vessels in patients with ph [2], as also
shown by the decreased level of exhaled no particularly
after cardiopulmonary bypass [24].
with increasing knowledge on the biological chemistry
of no derived from animal models and monitored clinical
applications, it became soon evident that the potential
benefits of ino were limited to its continuous administration and rapidly disappeared after discontinuation, often
with catastrophic rebound effects [25–27]. the possibility to
increase and/or to prolong the effect of ino, thus minimizing unwanted withdrawal phenomena, by intervening on its
metabolic cascade were then tested [1,28–30].
in 1995, kinsella first reported the enhance response of
an hypoxemic neonate with severe pulmonary hypertension
to low-dose of ino associated to the inhibition of cgmpspecific (type v) phosphodiesterase, by dp [28]. similarly,
in 1996 al-alaiyan presented the case of a neonate with
persistent ph successfully weaned off ino without
rebound crises only associating dp [29]. fullerton et al.
reported in 1997 the successful response to the combined
therapy of ino plus dp in patients with ph related to a
heart valve disease undergoing cardiac surgery but with
demonstrated no response to ino alone [1]. similarly, in
1998 ziegler reported on the augmented effect of dp
associated to ino in decreasing pvr in paediatric patients
with ph [6].
our study, although investigating on the same pharmacological association, has several important differences. the
27 adult patients included had a higher degree of ph (mean
pulmonary artery pressure at rest n35 mm hg and/or a
transpulmonary gradient n10 mm hg), always as a
consequence of a very long-lasting cardiac valve disease.
the setting of the trial was the intensive care unit, rather
than the operating room [1] or the catheterization laboratory
[6], and no administration started only after each patient
had achieved very stable hemodynamic parameters, thus
eliminating potentially confounding variables. all patients
followed similar cardiac anesthetic protocols. moreover, our
goals in this study were not to differentiate patients between
brespondersq versus bnon-respondersq to ino, but rather: (a)
to test among those who had shown some beneficial effects
to isolated ino any advantage related to the association with
dp; (b) to evaluate the potential of dp to mitigate the
clinical effect related to ino abrupt discontinuation.
all our patients showed at least a 10% decrease in pvr
vs. baseline after administration of isolated ino (responders). this was considered an inclusion criteria to proceed to
the second part of the study. this preliminary effect of ino
in our study population was unexpected in view of the ph
aetiology in our group, indeed related to longstanding left
atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension and traditionally

considered refractory or less responsive to vasodilator
therapy.
in our series, if ino produced a significant reduction in
pvr compared to baseline, the association with dp reached
a 34% reduction which further improved to 36% during sole
dp infusion. although part of this was certainly related to
an increase in cardiac index following dp (non-selective
effect), and expressed by an increment in heart rate and
stroke volume, overall benefit on patients hemodynamics
was rewarding.
similarly, cardiac index and mixed venous saturation
raised with ino. both variables further improved during
associated ino plus dp infusion and isolated dp infusion.
interestingly enough, the isolated infusion of dp after
discontinuation of ino still produced a remarkable and
longer-lasting effect on all the tested variables. this
evidence appears particularly important when compared to
the worsening trend observed after stopping isolated ino
(fig. 3) thus confirming the potential clinical role of pde5
inhibitors in the clinical practice.
only 9 patients (33%) showed substantial changes of
systemic arterial pressure, but none required volume and/or
inotropic adjustment during the trial.
despite the fact that during our study there were no
changes in level of no2 and methemoglobin did not even
approach toxic levels, it is well known that no is a
potentially dangerous gas and its prolonged administration
should be avoided particularly if associated with high dose
of inhaled oxygen. therefore, the association of ino and
dp, besides cooperating in improving hemodynamics in
patients with ph after cardiac surgery, might also offer the
advantage to minimize the potential side effects of no as a
consequence of its briefer administration. similarly, no side
effects related to the use of dp were observed.
our study has several limitations. the cohort of patients
observed, although larger than any from previous studies,
is still quite limited. diagnosis of ph was derived from
data obtained during cardiac catheterization performed at
different centres with different protocols (patient sedation,
ventilation, oxygen administration), thus making a clear
estimate of the real pulmonary hemodynamics of each
candidate difficult to evaluate and compare. perioperative
histological and immunohistochemical analyses of lung
tissue were not performed. it is possible that some of the
effects attributed to the combined therapy ino/dp were
rather due to repetitive ino dosing. however, augmentation of pulmonary vasodilatation with repeated short
exposure to ino has not been described, whereas
experimental evidence suggests that the opposite effect
may indeed occur [31]. moreover, we did not measure
cgmp levels and it is therefore possible that dp effect
resulted from other mechanisms (i.e. inhibition of adenosine re-uptake).
finally, although none of our patients showed postoperative actual evidence of low cardiac output, particularly
related to right ventricular dysfunction, still this study

f. santini et al. / international journal of cardiology 103 (2005) 156–163

allows for several inferences on the efficacy of this
pharmacological association which might have a potential
impact on clinical practice. the availability of greater
samples of patients for future analysis might also help to
define the stage of pre-operative pulmonary hypertension
where the treatment is more indicated with a higher rate of
long-term hemodynamic response.
in summary this study demonstrates the benefits of the
association ino plus dp in patient with secondary ph due
to a heart valve disease after cardiac surgery. this
association and the subsequent continuous infusion of
dp almost invariably produced better and longer-lasting
hemodynamic effects than ino alone followed by its
abrupt discontinuation. by reducing ino administration
time, the association of dp might help to minimize the
risk of gas-induced side effects in clinical practice. the
hemodynamic improvement related to this pharmacological approach might be of particular value in the
management of patients with associated signs of right
ventricular failure, thus allowing possible re-consideration
of surgical indication.
