abstract
recent studies have suggested that the protective anti-ischemic effects of  xxxd234xxx  are stronger than the inhibition of platelet
thromboxane a 2 synthesis. since ischemic events still occur in  xxxd234xxx -treated patients, the development of new drugs with
more powerful protective effects is needed. we compared the effects of a new platelet antiaggregating drug, 2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid žtriflusal. and of  xxxd234xxx  on the interaction between human neutrophils and platelets, examining the capability of
neutrophils to generate  xxxd2738xxx  žno..  xxxd3435xxx , in the presence of neutrophils, showed a greater antiplatelet potency than
 xxxd234xxx  to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet activation. significant stimulation of no-mediated mechanisms in the presence of
 xxxd234xxx  or  xxxd3435xxx  was demonstrated by the following findings: ž1. increased metabolism of arginine to citrulline, ž2. increase
of cgmp in the plateletrneutrophil system and ž3. the inhibitory action of the l-arginine žl-arg. competitive analogue, n g-nitro-larginine-methyl ester žl-name., which was reversed by  xxxd220xxx .  xxxd3435xxx  increased the stimulation of no synthesis by neutrophils more
than did of  xxxd234xxx . the main metabolite of  xxxd3435xxx , 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid žhtb., alone or in combination
with  xxxd234xxx , did not modify no production by neutrophils. therefore, the whole molecule of  xxxd3435xxx  is needed to stimulate
no production by neutrophils. our results show that, in the presence of neutrophils,  xxxd3435xxx  exerts an antiplatelet effect greater than that
of  xxxd234xxx , demonstrating a more powerful stimulation of the norcgmp system. the present results indicate that it is
possible to develop new and more potent  xxxd234xxx -related antiplatelet drugs for the prevention of the myocardial ischemicrreperfusion processes. q 1998 elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
during the last few years, a new concept has been
emerging about thrombosis as a multicellular event in
which cell-to-cell interactions amongst platelets, neutrophils and endothelium regulate the size of a growing
thrombus žmarcus, 1990; marcus and safier, 1993.. in
brief, there is evidence showing that two vasodilating
mediators produced by endothelial cells and neutrophils
žnitric oxide žno. and prostacyclin. have synergistic antiaggregating effects, mediated by the  xxxd1274xxx  žcgmp.and  xxxd1773xxx  žcamp.-related systems, respectively

inhibition of platelet activation has been the focus of
several pharmacologic strategies in the prevention and
treatment of thrombotic events.  xxxd234xxx  remains a keystone in these preventive and damage-limiting
strategies žcoller, 1991; willard et al., 1993.. however,
various compounds have been developed to improve the
efficacy of  xxxd234xxx .
 xxxd3435xxx  ž2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid. is a
new antiplatelet drug that, despite its structural analogy to
 xxxd234xxx  žfig. 1., exhibits different pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic and biochemical properties žfrancia
et al., 1978; rabasseda and garcıa-rafanell,
1993.. tri´
flusal has greater antiplatelet aggregating activity than
 xxxd234xxx , mainly due to its inhibitory activity on

several reports have demonstrated the protective role of
 xxxd234xxx  in the control of the complications of
myocardial ischemia and in the prevention of coronary
bypass graft thrombosis žlewis et al., 1983; theroux et al.,
1988; yusuf et al., 1988; kerins and fitzgerald, 1991;
mickelson et al., 1993.. however, inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by  xxxd234xxx  does not fully explain the antithrombotic effect of this drug ždi gaetano et
al., 1985; gaspari et al., 1987; metha and metha, 1993..
we have recently reported on new evidence demonstrating
that the antiaggregating properties of  xxxd234xxx 
do not depend solely on the described selective inhibitory
effect on thromboxane a 2 production by platelets. we
found that  xxxd234xxx  also inhibits platelet activation by stimulating no generation by neutrophils žlopez´
farre´ et al., 1995.. in the same line of evidence, de la
cruz et al. ž1988. have demonstrated that leukocytes potentiate the antiplatelet aggregation effect of  xxxd3435xxx  by an
undescribed mechanism. the aim of the present study was
to compare the effect of  xxxd3435xxx  and  xxxd234xxx 
on the interaction between human neutrophils and platelets,
examining the capability of neutrophils to generate no.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
 xxxd3253xxx -hypaque medium was obtained from flow laboratories žmadrid, spain..  xxxd234xxx , l-arginine
and n g -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester žl-name. were purchased from sigma chemicals žst. louis, mo..  xxxd3435xxx 
and htb were obtained from uriach laboratories
žbarcelona, spain.. w3 hxl-arginine and the  xxxd1274xxx 
radioinmmunoassay kit were purchased from amersham
žbuckinghamshire, uk.. thrombin was purchased from
ortho diagnostic systems žraritan, nj.. all other chemicals were of the highest commercially available quality
from sigma žst. louis, mo..

human neutrophils were obtained from peripheral blood
of healthy donors by ficollrhypaque centrifugation as
previously described žlopez-farre
´
´ et al., 1993; riesco et
al., 1993.. volunteer donors had not received drugs for at
least 20 days before the experiments. the protocol was
approved by the institutional ethics committee. neutrophils ž95% pure, 98% viable by trypan blue exclusion.
were resuspended in ca2q-physiological saline solution
žpss. containing žin mm:. 140 nacl, 4.6 kcl, 2.0  xxxg2125xxx  2 ,
1.0 mgcl 2 , 5.0 d-glucose and 10.0 hepes, ph 7.4.
2.3. platelet-rich plasma preparation and platelet aggregation
platelet activation was evaluated in a lumiaggregometer
žaggrecorder, four channels. by the change in light transmission as previously reported žlopez-farre
´
´ et al., 1995..
platelet rich plasma was obtained from the same donor of
neutrophils for each experiment. in brief, whole blood was
obtained in 10% žvrv. acid-citrate–dextrose and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min. platelet rich plasma was
collected and the platelet number was counted with a
coulter counter. the platelet number was adjusted with
platelet-poor plasma, obtained from the same donor, to
2.5 = 10 8 cellsrml plasma.
a platelet-poor sample was used as control for 100%
light transmission. to correct for the possible light absorption induced by the presence of the neutrophil suspension,
the platelet-poor sample contained a number of neutrophils
equal to that of the platelet-rich sample.
platelet rich plasma ž500 m l. was incubated at 378c for
3 min in the aggregometer with continuous stirring ž1000
rpm. and then stimulated with submaximal concentrations
of thrombin ž0.025 urml. or adp ž10y6 molrl.. before
stimulation, 100 m l of the neutrophil suspension was
added to plasma rich plasma to reach a final amount of
1.25 = 10 8 platelets and 1 = 10 6 neutrophils ž125:1.,
which approximate the relative concentrations in normal
blood. in other series of experiments, increasing neutrophil
concentrations ranging from 10 6 to 10 7 cellsrml were
added to 1.25 = 10 8 platelets.
to standardize the measurements, only the values of
turbidimetry at 5 min were used for the calculations. this
time period corresponds to the plateau of the maximum
value of the first wave of platelet aggregation. this primary wave represents platelet activation rather than platelet
aggregation and is partially reversible.  xxxd234xxx 
or  xxxd3435xxx  were added to the platelet–neutrophil suspension 5 min before platelet stimulation with thrombin or
adp.
in all cases, the comparative baseline measurements
were done in the presence of the solvent of the drugs,
0.8% nahco 3 žsodium bicarbonate..  xxxd3435xxx  and htb,
diluted in 0.8% nahco 3 , were allowed to stand 30 min

before being added to the assays žas recommended by the
manufacturer.. a similar protocol was followed for  xxxd234xxx  dilution. no significant effects were detected
in any case with these concentrations of sodium bicarbonate.
to determine the mechanisms involved in platelet aggregation inhibition, neutrophils were preincubated with
the no production antagonist, l-name ž10y5 molrl., 45
min before the experiments were performed. the lname-treated neutrophils were washed before being added
to the platelets. in addition, the no scavenger 2-ž4-carboxyphenyl.-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline 1-oxyl 3-oxide

fraction. and 0.5 molrl naoh žl-arginine fraction.. the
w3 hxl-citrulline fraction was quantified by liquid-scintillation counting. this column method separates l-arginine
from  xxxd2429xxx  by up to 92 " 3%.
2.6. statistical methods
the results are expressed as means " s.e.m. unless
otherwise stated, each value corresponds to a minimum of
eight experiments. to determine the statistical significance
of our results, we used an analysis of variance žanova.
with bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons or
the paired or unpaired student t-test. a p-value- 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

2.4. measurement of cgmp
to reproduce the conditions of the platelet activation
experiments, 1.25 = 10 8 platelets and 1 = 10 6 neutrophils
were incubated in the presence of  xxxd234xxx ,
 xxxd3435xxx  or htb. thrombin was added 5 min thereafter and
the platelet–neutrophil suspension was incubated for a
further 5 min at 378c. to stop the incubation, rgw cells
were pelleted by centrifugation ž2500 rpm, at 48c, 5 min..
the supernatant was aspirated and cells were extracted at
48c with a 49:1 žvrv. mixture of ethanolrhcl 0.1 m. the
extracts were evaporated, using a speed vac evaporator
žmodel vr-1r120r240, heto lab-equipment ars, denmark.. cgmp concentrations were measured in acetylated
samples by means of a radioimmunoassay kit žamersham.
as described žriesco et al., 1993..
2.5. determination of [3 h ] xxxd2429xxx  content
as detailed elsewhere žmetha and metha, 1993;

3
l-arginine and 1 m cirml w hxl-arginine. unincorporated
3
w hxl-arginine was washed out twice with pss-ca2q
buffer. 3 = 10 6 neutrophils were then incubated in the
presence of  xxxd3435xxx  or  xxxd234xxx  for 5 min at
378c. in all cases, the comparative baseline measurements
were done in the presence of 0.8% sodium bicarbonate, the
solvent of  xxxd3435xxx  and  xxxd234xxx .
to analyze the mechanisms involved in the  xxxd3435xxx 
effects, additional experiments were performed with incubation of neutrophils with htb,  xxxd234xxx  plus
htb,  xxxd234xxx  plus camp analogues ž8-brcamp and dibutyryl camp. or trifusal plus the protein
kinase a inhibitor,  xxxd477xxx .
neutrophils were lysed with cold ethanol and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under n2 at 378c. as
previously described žriesco et al., 1993., the extracts
were resuspended in 20 mmolrl hepesrkoh, ph 5.5
and applied to columns of dowex ag50wx8 žnaq form.,
which were subsequently eluted with water žl-citrulline

žfig. 2a.. in the presence of  xxxd234xxx  or  xxxd3435xxx ,
neutrophils significantly inhibited thrombin-induced
platelet activation. the effects of both  xxxd234xxx 
and  xxxd3435xxx  were concentration-dependent žfig. 2a.. in the
presence of neutrophils,  xxxd3435xxx  showed a higher antiplatelet potency than  xxxd234xxx  at concentrations up to 0.93 = 10y3 molrl žfig. 2a.. both  xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx  showed their maximal inhibitory
effect at 3.3 = 10y3 molrl. therefore, this latter concentration was used in subsequent studies.
in the absence of neutrophils, neither acetylsalicylic
acid nor  xxxd3435xxx  modified thrombin-induced platelet activation žfig. 2a.. a concentration-dependent acetylsalicylic
acid and  xxxd3435xxx -related inhibition of platelet activation by
neutrophils was also observed when adp ž10y6 molrl.
was used as platelet activator. a significant inhibitory
effect of both  xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx  per se was
detected on the adp-induced platelet activation žfig. 2b..
however, in the presence of neutrophils, both  xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx  showed an increased antiplatelet
aggregating effect žfig. 2b..
in the presence of neutrophils,  xxxd3435xxx  at concentrations
up to 0.82 = 10y3 molrl also was more potent as inhibitor
of the adp-stimulated platelet activation than  xxxd234xxx  žfig. 2b..
the inhibitory effect of 0.82 = 10y3 molrl trifusal on
adp-stimulated platelet activation was enhanced by increasing the number of neutrophils žfig. 3a..

a role of no was further confirmed by the incubation
of neutrophils with l-arginine ž10y4 molrl., which restored the  xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx -sensitive inhibitory effect of neutrophils in the presence of l-name
ž10y5 molrl. žfig. 4.. furthermore, the no scavenger

although with lower capacity than neutrophils, platelets
also could generate no žfor review see moncada et al.,
1991.. therefore, we determined the putative role of this
platelet-dependent no in the aforementioned results. in the
absence of neutrophils, l-name ž10y5 molrl. did not
modify thrombin-induced platelet activation in either the
presence or in the absence of  xxxd234xxx  or  xxxd3435xxx  ždata not shown.. in further experiments, we preincubated platelets with l-name for 30 min and, after
washing, neutrophils were added. therefore, only no
released from platelets was blocked. when we added the
neutrophils, both  xxxd3435xxx  and  xxxd234xxx  inhibited
the activation of thrombin-stimulated l-name-treated
platelets to the same extent as with l-name-untreated
platelets žtable 1.. these results suggest that the no
released from neutrophils and not from platelets is the only
no involved in the antiplatelet effects of acetylsalicylic

w3 hxl-citrulline formation from w3 hxl-arginine as described in section 2.
neutrophils were incubated in the absence žbaseline. or in the presence of
 xxxd234xxx  žasa, 3.3=10y3 molrl.,  xxxd3435xxx  ž3.3=10y3
molrl., htb ž3.3=10y3 molrl.. žb. determination of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthesis by human neutrophils, analyzing the effect of htb or two
different camp analogues, 8-br-camp ž10y4 molrl. and dibutyryl
camp žd-camp,10y4 molrl. on  xxxd234xxx  žasa.-stimulated
w3 hxl-citrulline generation. the effect of a  xxxg1836xxx  antagonist,
 xxxd477xxx  ž10y6 molrl., on  xxxd3435xxx -dependent no synthesis was also tested.
results are presented as means"s.e.m. of five different experiments.
wp - 0.05 with respect to basal. ) p - 0.05 with respect to  xxxd3435xxx -incubated neutrophils. q p - 0.05 with respect to asa-incubated neutrophils.

this study showed that  xxxd3435xxx , a new acetylsalicylic
acid-related drug, stimulates no generation by human
neutrophils to a greater extent than  xxxd234xxx .
the functional implication of these findings is that, in the
presence of neutrophils,  xxxd3435xxx  showed a greater capacity
to inhibit platelet activation than did  xxxd234xxx .
we have previously reported that  xxxd234xxx  acts
as an antiplatelet-activating agent not only through the
traditionally described mechanisms, but also by favouring
the platelet-inactivating effects of neutrophils through a
norcgmp-related pathway žlopez-farre
´
´ et al., 1995..
ž
.
de la cruz et al. 1988 evaluated the platelet antiaggregating potency of  xxxd3435xxx , using platelet rich plasma or
platelet poor plasma plus leukocytes, and found a greater
platelet inactivating effect of  xxxd3435xxx  in the presence of
leukocytes, mediated by an undescribed mechanism. this
phenomenon was not observed with the main metabolite of
 xxxd3435xxx , htb žde la cruz et al., 1988.. therefore, we
tested the effect of  xxxd3435xxx  and its metabolite, htb, on the
norcgmp system.
our first observation was that, in the presence of neutrophils,  xxxd3435xxx  and  xxxd234xxx  showed a greater

´

capacity to inhibit both adp and thrombin-induced platelet
activation, suggesting that platelet activation was blocked
at a postreceptor level. in the presence of neutrophils,
concentrations up to 0.93 = 10y3 molrl  xxxd3435xxx  showed a
higher potency than  xxxd234xxx  to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet activation. the therapeutic dose of
trifusal used in humans is between 300 to 900 mg once
daily. these trifusal concentrations are close to but do not
reach 0.93 = 10y3 molrl in vitro. therefore, one possibility suggested by the present results is that, to obtain
antiplatelet effects more potent than those of  xxxd234xxx , the in vivo doses of trifusal should be increased.
the potential functional involvement of no in the
 xxxd3435xxx -sensitive platelet inactivation by neutrophils was
first suggested by their inhibition with the l-arginine competitive analogue, l-name. the specificity of this inhibition was established by reversing the l-name effect with
excess l-arginine. furthermore, in the presence of neutrophils, the no scavenger, c-ptio, reversed the antiaggregating platelet effects of trifusal.
previous studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3435xxx  and its
deacetylated derivative, htb, induce camp accumulation
in platelets by inhibiting camp-phosphodiesterase activity
žgarcıa-rafanell
et al., 1986.. the more potent antiplatelet
´
effect of  xxxd3435xxx  as compared to that of acetylsalicylic
acid could result from the inhibition of cgmp-phosphodiesterase activity in platelets, thus aiding the action of
no. in the plateletrneutrophil system, htb alone produced a slight but significant accumulation of cgmp and
also increased  xxxd234xxx -stimulated cgmp levels
which could be explained by the inhibition of cgmp-phosphodiesterase activity favouring the action of no. however, the experiments on w3 hxl-citrulline production by
isolated neutrophils revealed that  xxxd3435xxx  stimulated no
generation by neutrophils directly with higher potency than
 xxxd234xxx .
several recent findings have indicated that  xxxd234xxx  might contribute to increase no synthesis or no
effects. in this regard, an antagonistic effect of  xxxd234xxx  has been observed on the vasoconstrictor properties of the l-arginine competitive analogue,  xxxd3291xxx 
žrosemblum et al., 1992.. in addition,  xxxd234xxx 
might alter the contractile effects of neutrophils on the
pulmonary artery žpatterson et al., 1992.. more recently,
we have shown that  xxxd234xxx  increases no
production by neutrophils žlopez-farre
´
´ et al., 1995., an
effect that is enhanced after myocardial ischemia žlopez´
farre´ et al., 1996..
in a second set of experiments, we studied the mechanism by which  xxxd3435xxx  caused a higher activation of no
production by neutrophils. we could not exclude that the
aforementioned effects of  xxxd3435xxx  on no generation by
neutrophils were exerted not only by  xxxd3435xxx  itself but also
by the combination of  xxxd3435xxx  and the htb generated in
the solution. therefore, we evaluated the involvement of
the deacetylated moiety, htb. htb alone modified nei-

63

ther basal no generation by neutrophils nor that induced
by  xxxd234xxx , indicating that the whole molecule
of  xxxd3435xxx  causes the activation of no generation by
neutrophils.
in a further set of experiments, we analyzed the involvement of camp in the mechanism that favors
 xxxd3435xxx -stimulated no production by neutrophils. phosphorylation of enzymes represents a fast regulation mechanism of enzymatic activity. several authors have demonstrated phosphorylation of no synthase by camp-dependent  xxxg1836xxx  žbrune
¨ and lapetina, 1991; bredt et
al., 1992., but to date the various findings regarding the
effects of  xxxg1836xxx -dependent phosphorylation on
the catalytic activity of no synthase present a less than
homogeneous picture žbrune
¨ and lapetina, 1991; bredt et
al., 1992; tamaoki et al., 1995.. although the camp
analogues enhanced  xxxd234xxx -induced no generation by neutrophils, the levels obtained were lower than
those found in the  xxxd3435xxx  experiments. furthermore, the
 xxxg1836xxx  antagonist, n-w2-ž p-bromocinnamylamino.ethylx-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide žh-89. slightly
affected trifusal-dependent no generation by neutrophils.
these results suggested that the  xxxd3435xxx -sensitive stimulation of no formation by neutrophils was unrelated to the
activity of the camprprotein kinase a system. the present data do not allow us to identify the putative mechanismžs. involved in the greater increase in no production
induced by  xxxd3435xxx  than by  xxxd234xxx . however,
the finding that the combination of  xxxd234xxx  plus
htb did not produce the levels of no generation seen
with  xxxd3435xxx -incubated neutrophils might indicate that to
obtain these effects the action of the whole molecule of
 xxxd3435xxx  must be necessary.
the main difference between the molecular structures
of  xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx  lies in the fluorinated
moiety žfig. 1. of the latter drug. the introduction of
fluorine atoms changes the chemical and biological properties of drugs. a known example in cardiology is  xxxd2113xxx ,
a fluorinated derivative of procainamide žhudak et al.,
1984.. there are several reports of differences between
 xxxd234xxx  and  xxxd3435xxx  with respect to inhibition
of both cyclooxygenase žde la cruz et al., 1986; de la
cruz et al., 1992. and camp-phosphodiesterase activities
žrabasseda and garcıa-rafanell,
1993.. the mechanism
´
by which  xxxd234xxx  activates no generation by
neutrophils remains unknown. although preliminary data
from our own laboratory have suggested a potential role
for  xxxd208xxx  and its non-cyclooxygenase derivatives žlopez-farre
´
´ et al., 1994., we could not exclude a
direct action of  xxxd234xxx  on no synthase, i.e.
acetylation žroth and siok, 1978.. if this latter possibility
applies  xxxd3435xxx , by means of its fluorinated moiety, could
activate no synthesis by human neutrophils more efficiently than  xxxd234xxx . further studies, beyond
the scope of the present research, are needed to elucidate
this hypothesis.

myocardial ischemiarreperfusion results in a diminished no release from endothelial cells žxin-liang et al.,
1993.. attempts have been made to supplement the reduced no in order to attenuate myocardial injury. in
animal models, the infusion of either organic no donors,
no itself or the substrate for no synthesis, l-arginine,
provides significant cardioprotective effects against ischemia žjohnson et al., 1991; weyrich et al., 1992; lefer
et al., 1993.. although  xxxd234xxx  is used in
patients with ischemic heart disease because of its antithrombotic properties, additional protective effects could
be obtained by enhancing the no synthesis in neutrophils
as found in our in vitro experiments with  xxxd3435xxx . our
results suggest that it is possible to develop new and more
effective  xxxd234xxx -related antithrombotic drugs
whose therapeutic potential should be tested in clinical
trials.
