endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production in multiple myeloma patients treated with chimeric monoclonal anti- xxxg1181xxx  antibodies indicates the existence of a ...  in vitro as well as in vivo observations have shown that  xxxg1181xxx  plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. therefore we started a phase i/ii dose escalating study with chimeric monoclonal anti- xxxg1181xxx  antibodies (cmab) in multiple myeloma (mm) patients resistant to second-line chemotherapy. here we describe the pharmacological data as well as a new method for calculating the endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production. the cmab (clb  xxxg1181xxx /8; kd: 6.25 x 10(-12) m) was given in two cycles of 14 daily infusions, starting on day 1 and day 28. daily dose: 5 mg in patients 1-3, 10 mg in patients 4-6, and 20 mg in patients 7-9 (total dose 140, 280, and 560 mg of anti- xxxg1181xxx , respectively). using the pharmacokinetic data of free  xxxg1181xxx  and the binding characteristics of the cmab, the endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production could be calculated from day to day using a one-compartment open model. the median half-life time of this antibody was 17.6 d. no human antichimeric antibodies were induced. pre-treatment median endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production in the mm patients was 60 micrograms/d (range 13.8-230; normal controls < 7 micrograms/d). during treatment with anti- xxxg1181xxx  cmabs, the endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production immediately decreased in all patients to below 3 micrograms/d and never reached the pre-treatment value during the treatment period, except in two patients who developed an active infection, resulting in an  xxxg1181xxx  production of 128 and 1,208 micrograms/d, respectively. we concluded that in mm patients endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production is 2-30 times higher than in healthy individuals. the anti- xxxg1181xxx  cmab strongly suppress this endogenous  xxxg1181xxx  production, probably by blocking a positive feed-back loop, but this cmab does not prevent infection-induced  xxxg1181xxx  production. the chimeric anti- xxxg1181xxx  mabs have a long half-life time, a low immunogenicity, and are able to block  xxxg1181xxx -dependent processes in vivo.
