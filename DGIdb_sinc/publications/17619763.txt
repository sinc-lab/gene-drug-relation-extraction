renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a highly vascular tumor in which a growing understanding
of disease biology has been translated into clinically active systemic therapies. the most
clinically developed targeted therapies in advanced rcc are those that target the
 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) ligand or receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ) and therapy
directed against the mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor). sutent and sorafenib are
orally available inhibitors of the  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and platelet derived growth factor receptor
( xxxg1710xxx ).  xxxd3307xxx  is an mtor inhibitor that leads to g1 cell cycle arrest and may
affect vegf production. this article briefly describes the biological pathways involved in
the development of rcc and the results of clinical trials using targeted therapy in
metastatic rcc.

introduction
the estimated number of new patients with renal cell carcinoma (rcc) in 2006 is 38,890[1]. renal cell
carcinoma is a highly vascular tumor, which is resistant to most forms of standard cancer treatment
including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. immunotherapy has historically been used to treat metastatic
rcc. interferon (ifn) produces a response rate of 15-20% with a modest survival advantage over
inactive therapy[2,3]. interleukin-2 (il-2) can be given in low doses subcutaneously or as high-dose
intravenously. response rates of 15-20% are observed, with a small proportion (4-5%) achieving a
durable complete response[4,5,6]. during the past decade, there has been an explosive understanding of
the molecular mechanisms involved in rcc associated with the von hippel-lindau (vhl) syndrome.
this molecular pathway is also altered in clear cell sporadic rcc, and thus therapeutic targets have
emerged. clinical targeting of various aspects of this pathway has resulted in substantial gains in the
clinical treatment of metastatic rcc.

the vhl pathway in rcc
vhl is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by the development of renal
cysts, retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts and carcinomas and renal cell
carcinoma. in the early 1990s the vhl tumor suppressor gene was identified and mapped to chromosome
3p25[7]. somatic inactivation of both copies of the vhl gene by mutation, deletion or methylation has
been identified in up to 60% of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas[8,9,10].
the most important function of the protein product of the vhl gene ( xxxg2415xxx ) is to bind to target
proteins as an adapter molecule in the multi subunit ubiquitin ligase complex. the most important  xxxg2415xxx 
target protein is the  xxxg216xxx  of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (hif-1). under normoxic conditions,
hif-1 alpha is hydroxylated and forms a complex with the vhl protein complex. under hypoxia, hif is not
hydroxylated and therefore does not interact with vhl. a similar situation occurs when there is a loss of
function of the vhl gene as in rcc. in this circumstance, the  xxxg1048xxx  transcription factor accumulates.
hif-1 alpha binds with hif-1 beta and the complex leads to transcription of a variety of genes responsible for
the high expression of vegf[11,12] . other growth factors that are over expressed in renal cell
carcinomas as a result of vhl pathway activation are pdgf and tgf-alpha. these mitogenic growth factors
bind to the receptor tyrosine kinases on the cell membranes of rcc cells and activate downstream signal
transduction cascades, which lead to cell cycle progression and proliferation. the importance of vhl
pathway and angiogenesis in clear cell rcc led to clinical trials utilizing angiogenesis inhibitors in the
management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

bevacizumab (avastin®)
bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to vegf (the murine parent antibody is mumab
a.4.6.1). in 1997 presta et al.[13] demonstrated the effects of a humanized vegf inhibitor and showed
that it inhibits vegf-induced proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo with
potency and efficacy very similar to those of the murine monoclonal antibody. the clinical effect was
studied in a phase ii rcc trial that randomized 116 patients to receive either low dose (n=37) or high
dose bevacizumab (n=39) or placebo (n=40)[14]. the progression free survival in the group treated with
high dose bevacizumab was significantly longer than the group treated with placebo (4.8 months versus
2.5 months, p=0.001). there was a marginally significant improvement when the low dose group was
compared to placebo (p=0.053). hypertension and proteinuria were the most common side effects most
notable in the high dose bevacizumab arm. bevacizumab has also been studied in combination with the
 xxxg682xxx  (egfr) inhibitor  xxxd2029xxx [15] in which 63 patients were treated and a
response rate of 25% was observed, with additional patients experiencing minor tumor shrinkage. a
subsequent randomized trial investigated the combination of bevacizumab and  xxxd2029xxx  and was
compared with bevacizumab alone in randomized phase ii trial[16]. the progression free survival in the
group that received bevacizumab and  xxxd2029xxx  was 9.9 months vs. 8.5 months in the group that received
only bevacizumab (p=n.s.). this trial demonstrated a substantial pfs for bevacizumab in untreated
metastatic rcc patients, and also that adding  xxxd2029xxx  is not of benefit. two randomized phase iii trials
have also been completed which randomized untreated metastatic clear cell rcc patients to ifn alone or
ifn plus bevacizumab and were powered to investigate an overall survival benefit. results from these
trials will add to the data regarding the effect of bevacizumab in metastatic rcc.

sorafenib (nexavar®)
sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets raf kinases ( xxxg1924xxx , wild-type b-raf, and b-raf
v600e), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis such as  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx [17,18]. the activity of sorafenib on metastatic rcc was demonstrated in phase i studies using a
continuous dosage of 400mg bid[19]. dose limiting toxicities observed were grade 3 diarrhea, hand-foot
syndrome and fatigue. sorafenib was then compared with placebo in a phase ii randomized
discontinuation study (n=202)[20]. all patients received twelve weeks of sorafenib, and then patients with
tumor burden change within 25% of baseline measurements were randomized to placebo or continuation
of sorafenib. the median progression free survival was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (24
weeks versus 6 weeks in the placebo group, p=0.0087). the most common adverse events were fatigue,
rash / desquamation, hand foot skin reaction and diarrhea. in a phase iii trial[21] patients who received
one prior systemic therapy were randomized to receive either continuous sorafenib 400 mg bid or
matched placebo with best supportive care (bsc). the secondary end point was pfs, which was reported
after 363 events. the median pfs was significantly longer in the sorafenib treated group (24 weeks)
compared to placebo (12 weeks; p<0.000001). based on these data, sorafenib was approved by the fda
for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in december 2005.
the combination of sorafenib with other agents is also being investigated in metastatic rcc. the
combination of sorafenib and ifn alpha was investigated in two phase ii studies[22,23]. these studies
demonstrated response rates of 42% and 19%. toxicity was as expected for each agent, with a notable
low incidence of hand foot syndrome. further investigation is ongoing. a phase i/ii trial with
bevacizumab and sorafenib in metastatic rcc is also currently ongoing. limited data is available thus
far, but suggests less than full doses of both drugs are tolerable[24].

sunitinib (sutent®)
sunitinib is a potent orally active inhibitor of multiple protein tyrosine kinases including  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx . two multi-center phase ii trials were undertaken to evaluate safety and efficacy of sunitinib
dosed as 50mg daily for 28 days, followed by 14 days of rest in patients with advanced metastatic rcc
[25,26]. the first trial was conducted on 63 metastatic rcc patients who failed prior cytokine-based
therapy. the overall response rate per recist criteria was 40%, a substantial improvement over
historical standards. to confirm the results of this trial, a second open label multi center trial was initiated
treating 106 patients with cytokine-refractory clear cell rcc and demonstrated a response rate of 43%.
the combined analysis of both phase ii trials revealed a response rate of 42% and a pfs of 8.2 months.
these studies demonstrate that sunitinib is an effective second line therapy in cytokine refractory rcc.
based on these data, sunitinib was fda approved for the treatment of advanced rcc in january 2006.
continuous dosing of sunitinib 37.5 mg daily has also been investigated in a phase ii multi center
study, in which patients were randomized to receive 37.5 mg of sunitinib either in the morning or in the
evening[27]. preliminary data demonstrates a response rate of 15% and a median pfs of 8.3 months. the
response rate data is immature, and thus comparisons to the interrupted sunitinib dosing schedule can not
be made. it may be that higher, intermittent doses are required for a higher response rate, but that pfs is
identical for either schedule. further follow up is needed.
in an ongoing phase iii trial in untreated metastatic rcc (n=750)[28], sunitinib is being compared
with ifn to explore the possibility of front line usage of this potent agent. preliminary data presented
indicate a statistically significant difference in the progression free survival 47.3 vs.24.9 weeks
(p<0.000001). the objective response rate by third-party independent review was 24.8% (95% ci 19.7,
30.5) for sunitinib vs. 4.9% (95% ci 2.7, 8.1) for  xxxg1137xxx  (p<0.000001). this study demonstrated the
superior efficacy of sunitinib over ifn in the first line treatment of metastatic rcc. overall survival data
is not presently available.

the mtor pathway
mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) is a protein kinase of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(pi3k)/akt signaling pathway, which plays an important role in multiple intracellular signaling pathways
leading to tumor formation and growth. mtor phosphorylation initiates mrna translation and
subsequent translation of proteins involved in cell growth and differentiation including hif- alpha, vegf
and pdgf.

 xxxd3307xxx 
 xxxd3307xxx  is an inhibitor of mtor.  xxxd3307xxx  leads to cell cycle arrest in g1 phase in pre clinical
studies. an initial phase ii trial[29] in metastatic rcc randomized patients to one of three dose levels of
 xxxd3307xxx : 25mg, 75mg or 125 mg. the objective response rate for the entire cohort was 7%, and the
median time to progression was 5.8 months. the toxicities reported were maculopapular rash (76%),
mucositis (70%), asthenia (50%), and nausea (43%). the most frequently occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse
events were hyperglycemia (17%), hypophosphatemia (13%), anemia (9%), and hypertriglyceridemia
(6%). a retrospective analysis found that patients with multiple adverse risk factors had a more favorable
outcome than historic controls. thus, a subsequent phase iii trial randomized untreated metastatic rcc
patients with 3 or more of 6 adverse risk features to ifn alone,  xxxd3307xxx  alone or ifn plus
 xxxd3307xxx [30]. adverse risk features includes ldh > 1.5x upper limit of normal, hemoglobin < lower
limit of normal, corrected serum calcium > 10 mg/dl, time from diagnosis of rcc to treatment of > 1
year, karnofsky performance status 60-70% and multiple organ sites of metastases. the median survival
was highest in the  xxxd3307xxx  arm (10.9 months) compared to 7.3 months in the ifn monotherapy arm

(p=0.0069) and 8.4 months in the combined  xxxd3307xxx  plus ifn arm. the grade 3 adverse events were
asthenia, anemia and dyspnea; anemia and asthenia were higher among patients who received ifncontaining regimens.  xxxd3307xxx  is being further investigated in metatstatic rcc in combination with
agents that target the vegf pathway based on the preclinical evidence that the two pathways converge to
regulate hif.

discussion
renal cell carcinoma has historically been a treatment resistant tumor. association of renal cell carcinoma
with inherited vhl syndrome and the subsequent elucidation of relevant biological pathways in clear cell
rcc have changed the approach to systemic therapy. drugs targeting the vegf and related pathways
have robust clinical activity. ongoing clinical trials are exploring multiple options such as combining
molecular targets with cytokines and combining targeting agents directed against different proteins in the
same or different molecular pathways. the emergence of active agents in rcc has generated several
needs within the rcc clinical research arena. one pressing need is a pre-clinical model that can replicate
the phenotype of disease and treatment with these drugs to better understand mechanisms of response and
resistance. predictive clinical and molecular markers also require investigation to most appropriately
target these agents. in addition, standard ct scans and recist criteria are often inadequate to evaluate
response and progression with vegf-targeted therapy. investigation of newer imaging modalities and
evaluation criteria is warranted. a new era of treatment in metastatic rcc has emerged, however, where
rational therapeutic targeting has lead to substantial clinical advances.
