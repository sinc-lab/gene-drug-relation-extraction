abstract
currently, a new type of calcium channel
blockers, which can inhibit not only
l-type calcium channels abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscles, but
also n-type calcium channels that
abound in the sympathetic nerve endings,
have been developed. in this study, analysis on a like-for-like basis of the l- and
n-type calcium channel-inhibitory activity of typical dihydropyridine-type calcium-channel blockers (dhps) was performed. moreover, to understand the
differences of n-type calcium channel inhibition among dhps, the binding of
dhps to the channel was investigated by
means of hypothetical three-dimensional
pharmacophore modeling using multiple
calculated low-energy conformers of the
dhps. all of the tested compounds, i. e.
cilnidipine (cas 132203-70-4), efonidipine
(cas 111011-76-8), amlodipine (cas
111470-99-6), benidipine (cas 85387-35-5),
azelnidipine (cas 123524-52-7) and
nifedipine (cas  xxxd2722xxx ), potently inhibited the l-type calcium channel,
whereas only cilnidipine inhibited the
n-type calcium channel (ic50 value:

key words
51.2 nm). a virtual three-dimensional
structure of the n-type calcium channel
was generated by using the structure of
the peptide x-conotoxin gvia, a standard
inhibitor of the channel, and cilnidipine
was found to fit well into this pharmacophore model. lipophilic potential maps
of x-conotoxin gvia and cilnidipine supported this finding. conformational overlay of cilnidipine and the other dhps indicated that amlodipine and nifedipine
were not compatible with the pharmacophore model because they did not contain an aromatic ring that was functionally equivalent to tyr13 of x-conotoxin
gvia. azelnidipine, benidipine, and
efonidipine, which have this type of aromatic ring, were not positively identified
due to intrusions into the excluded volume. estimation of virtual three-dimensional structures of proteins, such as ion
channels, by using standard substrates
and/or inhibitors may be a useful method
to explore the mechanisms of pharmacological and toxicological effects of substrates and/or inhibitors, and to discover
new drugs.

1. introduction
dihydropyridine derivatives are effective antihypertensive agents in a wide range of patients, and many dihydropyridine-type calcium-channel blockers (dhps) are
used in the clinical treatment of hypertension [1, 2].

available worldwide. while calcium channels are pharmacologically classified into at least five different subclasses i. e. l-, n-, p-, q-, and r-type, dhps have been
considered as selective blockers of the l-type channel
[3 – 5]. although there are many reports dealing with
the inhibitory effects of various dhps on l-type calcium
channel [6 – 11], comparison is difficult because the anaogihara et al. – dihydropyridines

lytical methods were generally different, and some
dhps are not commercially available as reagents. moreover, it was reported that cilnidipine (cas 132203-70-4),
which inhibits not only the l-type calcium channel but
also the n-type channel, hardly caused reflux tachycardia as a side effect, while most dhps with only l-type
inhibitory activity may cause tachycardia with increasing heart rate [5, 12, 13]. further, amlodipine was reported to show n-type calcium channel inhibition [14],
although other authors found that it did not [13, 15]. to
address these issues at the molecular level, we performed analysis on a like-for-like basis of the l- and ntype calcium channel-inhibitory activities of typical
dhps, i. e. cilnidipine, efonidipine (cas 111011-76-8),
amlodipine (cas 111470-99-6), benidipine (cas 8538735-5), azelnidipine (cas 123524-52-7) and nifedipine
(cas  xxxd2722xxx ) (fig. 1). efonidipine and azelnidipine
were obtained by extraction and purification from medicinal products, since they are not commercially available in pure form. moreover, the binding between dhps
and n-type calcium channel was investigated by means
of three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling in order
to understand the difference of n-type inhibition activity among dhps. because n-type calcium channel is a
membrane protein, it is difficult to crystallize for x-ray
analysis [3 – 5], so we computationally generated a hypothetical three-dimensional structure of the binding
site of n-type calcium channel by using the structure
of a standard inhibitor of the channel, x-conotoxin
gvia, as a template.

2. material and methods
2.1 chemicals and assay of the inhibitory effect
on l- and n-type calcium channels
nifedipine was purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca,
usa). amlodipine, benidipine and cilnidipine were purchased
from toronto research chemicals (ontario, canada). efonidipine and azelnidipine were extracted from the drugs landeltm
(shionogi, osaka, japan) and calblocktm (daiichi-sankyo, tokyo, japan) and purified by column chromatography. the
chemical structures of both compounds were confirmed by
1
h-nmr, and the compounds were confirmed to be more than
99 % pure by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc). all other chemicals and solvents were commercial products of analytical or hplc grade. binding assays for l- [16, 17]
and n-type [18] calcium channels were carried out by mds
pharma services (taipei, taiwan). briefly, rats were killed by
decapitation and the whole brain quickly was removed. the
brain frontal lobe was then dissected and frozen at – 80 'c.
membranes were prepared from the frontal lobe and [125i]
x-conotoxin gvia binding were measured as previously reported [18]. in the inhibition study of specific [125i] x-conotoxin
gvia binding, the binding was measured in the presence of
various concentrations of the dhps at a [125i] x-conotoxin
gvia concentration of 0.01 nm. the ic50 values were calculated
from semi-logarithmic plots.

2.2 three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling
of n-type calcium channel
a pharmacophore model was constructed from the solution
structure of x-conotoxin gvia (pdb id: 1ttl) using the catalyst program (accelrys, san diego, ca, usa). the pharmacoarzneimittelforschung 2009;59(6):283–288

3. results
inhibition of l- and n-type calcium channels by dhps
is shown in fig. 2, and the ic50 values are listed in table 1. based on l-type calcium channel-inhibitory potency, the dhps were categorized into three classes,
i. e. strong inhibitors (ic50 < 1 nm): cilnidipine and benidipine, moderate inhibitors (1 nm < ic50 < 10 nm): azelnidipine, efonidipine and nifedipine, and weak inhibitors (10 nm < ic50): amlodipine. the ic50 values of
efonidipine and azelnidipine were consistent with reported values [8, 11], confirming that the extracted materials retained inhibitory activity for l-type calcium
channel. on the other hand, we found that only cilnidipine had inhibitory activity for n-type calcium channel
(ic50 value: 51.2 nm), while the other dhps showed no
apparent inhibition even at a concentration of 10 lm
(table 1).
to construct a pharmacophore model of the n-type
calcium channel blocker, model number 1 of x-conotoxin gvia was selected from 20 structures with the

lowest energy. it was reported previously that the critical channel-blocking residues are tyr13 and lys2 (fig. 3 a)
[19 – 21]. using the catalyst program to analyze the
pharmacophore model, an aromatic ring feature was
defined using the coordinates of the benzene ring of
the side chain of tyr13, and a hydrogen bond donor
was defined using the coordinates of the nitrogen atom
of the lys2 side chain. moreover, an excluded volume
was added to the pharmacophore model assuming that
x-conotoxin gvia and cilnidipine bind to the same site
on the channel. using insightii, the excluded volume
was a connolly surface with a big_dot-style atom radius
of 1.8 å for x-conotoxin gvia (fig. 3 b). after screening,
cilnidipine was mapped to the pharmacophore model
(fig. 3c), whereas other dhps such as amlodipine, azelnidipine, benidipine, efonidipine, and nifedipine, did
not fit the model. moreover, to examine the lipophilicity
of the molecular surface, lipophilic potential maps of
the solution structure of x-conotoxin gvia and the active conformation of cilnidipine were rendered using
sybyl7.1 and compared with each other (fig. 4). the lipophilic potential maps showed that similar residues
were critical for activity, supporting the identified active
conformation of cilnidipine in the pharmacophore
model.
to examine the structural differences between cilnidipine and the other dhps, low-energy conformers of the
dhps were created using the omega2 program. all of
the generated conformers were scored based on their

phore features in the model were selected based on the coordinates of the residues that are important for the inhibitory activity of x-conotoxin gvia. the excluded volume added to the
pharmacophore model was obtained from the coordinates of
the molecular surface of x-conotoxin gvia using insight ii (accelrys). all of the structures of the dhps (cilnidipine, efonidipine, amlodipine, benidipine, azelnidipine and nifedipine)
were converted in the catalyst multiconformers database
(best, maximum 255 conformers per compound). the pharmacophore model could then be used to virtually screen the
dhps using the best flexible search algorithms. to be identified as positive, a molecule was required to fit all of the features
of the catalyst model (accelrys). the lipophilic potential maps
of the molecular surfaces were rendered within the sybyl7.1
molcad module (tripos, st. louis, mo, usa). the low-energy
multiconformers of the compounds were generated using the
omega2 program (openeye scientific software, santa fe,
nm, usa). subsequently, multiconformer structures were entered in the rocs program (openeye scientific software) and
the conformer with highest shape similarity to the query molecule was selected.

similarity to the active conformation of cilnidipine using
the rocs program. the overlay between cilnidipine and
the conformation of each molecule with the best score
indicated that amlodipine and nifedipine were not compatible with the pharmacophore model because they
did not contain an aromatic ring that was functionally
equivalent to tyr13 (fig. 5 a and 5 e). on the other hand,
azelnidipine, benidipine, and efonidipine contain this
type of aromatic ring, but were not positively identified
due to intrusions into the excluded volume (fig. 5 b –
5 d). therefore, these compounds are likely to be sterically hindered from binding to n-type calcium channels.

4. discussion
three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling are
widely used for the prediction of in vitro or in vivo interactions between chemical compounds and their biological targets, such as transporters, receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. the pharmacophore could now
help to identify or construct compounds with additional
antisympathetic activities and elaborate how this could
become clinically prognostic relevance. there are several reports on three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship
(qsar) of dhps for the l-type calcium channel [22 –
24], but not the n-type calcium channel.
we firstly organized inhibitory effects of various dhps
on n-type calcium channel blockers (fig. 2, table 1).
watanabe et al. [6] compared the antihypertensive effects of dhps in shrsp rats, based on calculated ed20
values (dose with a 20 % antihypertensive effect). they
found that cilnidipine showed the lowest ed20 (1.9 mg/
kg), followed by benidipine (2.4 mg/kg), amlodipine
(3.3 mg/kg), and nifedipine (3.6 mg/kg). the order is
not entirely consistent with our results. however, the
antihypertensive effects in vivo would reflect not only
the inhibitory potency on calcium channels, but also
pharmacokinetic factors, such as bioavailability. interestingly, we found that 10 lm cilnidipine caused only
75 % inhibition, suggesting that this compound is a partial antagonist for the n-type calcium channel. fujii
et al. [12] reported a similar finding in rat dorsal root
ganglion neurons.

show the regions located in the excluded volume.

a three-dimensional model of the n-type calcium
channel blocker was constructed by extracting a pharmacophore from x-conotoxin gvia (fig. 3). x-conotoxin gvia, a well-known n-type calcium channel blocker
containing 27 amino acid residues (ckspgsscsptsynccrscnpytkrcy), was isolated from cone snail toxin
[25, 26]. then, a concise structure-activity relationship
for inhibition of n-type calcium channel was established by using our novel pharmacophore model. dhps
other than cilnidipine do not sterically fit the model.
these findings are consistent with the observed inhibiarzneimittelforschung 2009;59(6):283–288

tory activity in our experiments (fig. 2 and 5, table 1).
membrane proteins such as n-type calcium channel often are difficult to crystallize for x-ray structure analysis.
therefore, estimating virtual three-dimensional structures of these proteins and the active conformation of
inhibitors by using their native substrates and/or inhibitors as templates may be a useful method to understand
the mechanisms of the pharmacological and toxicological effects of substrates and/or inhibitors, and to discover new drugs [27, 28].
