agents which block potassium-chloride cotransport prevent sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic audiogenic seizure-prone rats.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether the loop diuretics furosemide, bumetanide and  xxxd2049xxx , which block the  xxxg2081xxx  potassium-chloride transporter in the kidney loop of henle and the  xxxg2082xxx  potassium-chloride transporter in neuronal membranes, would prevent sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic audiogenic seizure-prone rats. the rats were infused with the test agent via tail vein shortly before being tested for seizure susceptibility by exposure to loud noise (an alarm bell) for 60 s. sound exposures were repeated at intervals to determine the time course of the seizure suppression effect. all three loop diuretics suppressed sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic rats tested 2 days to 4 weeks after the ischemic exposure. furosemide 200 mg/kg had no effect in 4/4 rats made acutely audiogenic seizure-prone by infusion of bicuculline into the inferior colliculus, indicating that the effect was not due to general anti-seizure activity. mannitol 2 g/kg had no effect in 6/6 post-ischemic rats, indicating that the effect was not due to diuresis or fluid shifts. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the exposure to global ischemia caused an upregulation of the potassium-chloride transporter  xxxg2082xxx  in neurons which persisted for at least 4 weeks.
