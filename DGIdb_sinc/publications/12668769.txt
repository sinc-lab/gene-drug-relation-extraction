investigating the regulation of one-carbon metabolism in arabidopsis thaliana.  serine (ser) biosynthesis in c(3) plants can occur via several pathways. one major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (thf)-dependent activities of the  xxxg896xxx  complex (gdc,  xxxg263xxx ) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ,  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) with glycine (gly) as one-carbon (1-c) source. an alternative thf-dependent pathway involves the  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  activities with formate as 1-c source. here, we have investigated aspects of the regulation of these two folate-mediated pathways in arabidopsis thaliana (l.) heynh. columbia using two approaches. firstly, transgenic plants overexpressing formate dehydrogenase ( xxxg76xxx   xxxg131xxx ,  xxxg127xxx   xxxg128xxx   xxxg129xxx   xxxg130xxx   xxxg132xxx   xxxg133xxx   xxxg134xxx   xxxg135xxx   xxxg136xxx   xxxg138xxx   xxxg140xxx   xxxg141xxx   xxxg861xxx   xxxg862xxx .2) were used to continue our previous studies on the function of  xxxg76xxx   xxxg131xxx  in formate metabolism. the formate pool size was approximately 73 nmol (g fw)(-1) in wild type (wt) arabidopsis plants; three independent transgenic lines had similar-sized pools of formate. transgenic plants produced more (13)co(2) from supplied [(13)c]formate than did wt plants but were not significantly different from wt plants in their synthesis of ser. we concluded that  xxxg76xxx   xxxg131xxx  has no direct role in the regulation of the above two pathways of ser synthesis; the breakdown of formate to co(2) by the  xxxg76xxx   xxxg131xxx  reaction is the primary and preferred fate of the organic acid in arabidopsis. the ratio between the gdc/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathways of ser synthesis from [alpha-(13)c]gly and [(13)c]formate, respectively, in arabidopsis shoots was 21 : 1; in roots, 9 : 1. in shoots, therefore, the pathway from formate plays only a small role in ser synthesis; in the case of roots, results indicated that the 9 : 1 ratio was as a result of greater fluxes of (13)c through both pathways together with a relatively higher contribution from the  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  route than in shoots. we also examined the synthesis of ser in a gdc-deficient mutant of arabidopsis (glyd) where the gdc/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathway was impaired. compared with wt, glyd plants accumulated 5-fold more gly than wt after supplying [alpha-(13)c]gly for 24 h; the accumulation of ser from [alpha-(13)c]gly was reduced by 25% in the same time period. on the other hand, the accumulation of ser through the  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathway in glyd plants was 2.5-fold greater than that in wt plants. our experiments confirmed that the gdc/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathways normally operate independently in arabidopsis plants but that when the primary gdc/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathway is impaired the alternative  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of ser.
