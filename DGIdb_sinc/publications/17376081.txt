summary
immune escape is considered to be the driving force
behind structural variability of major antigens on the
surface of bacterial pathogens, such as fimbriae. in
the dr family of escherichia coli adhesins, structural
and adhesive functions are carried out by the same
subunit. dr adhesins have been shown to bind decayaccelerating factor (daf), collagen iv, and  xxxg427xxx -related cell adhesion molecules
(ceacams). we show that genes encoding dr adhesins from 100 e. coli strains form eight structural
groups with a high level of amino acid sequence
diversity between them. however, genes comprising
each group differ from each other by only a small
number of point mutations. out of 66 polymorphisms
identified within the groups, only three were synonymous mutations, indicating strong positive selection
for amino acid replacements. functional analysis of
intragroup variants comprising the dr haemagglutinin
(drae) group revealed that the point mutations result
in distinctly different binding phenotypes, with a
tendency of increased affinity to daf, decreased
sensitivity of daf binding to inhibition by chloramphenicol, and loss of binding capability to collagen,
ceacam3 and ceacam6. thus, variability by point
mutation of major antigenic proteins on the bacterial
surface can be a signature of selection for functional
modification.

introduction
bacterial fimbriae are organelles that mediate adherence
to host surfaces in commensal and pathogenic niches.
fimbriae are usually abundant on the bacterial surface
and, thus, the fimbrial structural subunit represents a
major surface antigen and exhibits a high level of structural variability. major surface antigens of bacterial
pathogens are under frequency-dependent selective
pressure causing extensive antigenic variation within the
population (boyd and hartl, 1998; zhu et al., 2001).
structural diversity of surface antigens is driven by horizontal gene transfer, inter and intragenic recombination,
and point mutations (boyd and hartl, 1998; peek et al.,
2001; boyd and waldor, 2002). however, mutations can
also affect protein function, and selective pressure for
functional changes may vary depending upon the environment. in pathogens, such functional mutations are a
basis for pathoadaptive evolution of virulence
(sokurenko et al., 1999). thus, for understanding
molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis and
evolution, it is necessary to distinguish the patterns of
structural changes in a major surface antigen that are
induced by immune pressure from those that are
induced by selection for functional variation. here we
show that presence of point amino acid mutations in
highly variable surface antigens of pathogenic bacteria
may be a signature for selection of adaptive functional
changes instead of or in addition to selection for immune
escape.
the dr family of adhesins of escherichia coli is associated with diarrhoea and urinary tract infections (uti)
(servin, 2005). this family includes a number of adhesins of fimbrial and afimbrial morphologies that recognize
as a receptor decay-accelerating factor (daf), a complement regulatory protein present on a variety of epithelial
surfaces (nowicki et al., 1993; medof et al., 1987). additional receptors recognized by some dr family adhesins
include type iv collagen and carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecules (ceacams) including
cea,  xxxg426xxx  and ceacam6 (westerlund et al.,
1989; guignot et al., 2000; berger et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006a). major structural, antigenic and adhesive functions of dr adhesins reside in a single structural
subunit (bilge et al., 1989; swanson et al., 1991; van loy
et al., 2002a). the gene encoding the major structural/

functional diversity in e. coli dr adhesins 181
adhesive subunit of dr adhesins is highly variable while
genes encoding regulatory and transport/assembly proteins are highly conserved among members of the dr
family (servin, 2005). it has been shown that naturally
occurring point mutations in dr family adhesins can
affect their adhesive properties (nowicki et al., 1990;
le bouguenec et al., 1993; carnoy and moseley, 1997;
pettigrew et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006a). for
example, dr haemagglutinin (drae), expressed by uropathogenic e. coli, binds to daf, type iv collagen (westerlund et al., 1989) and  xxxg427xxx  (cea),
and binding to these receptors is sensitive to chloramphenicol (cm) inhibition (nowicki et al., 1990; korotkova
et al., 2006a). afae-3, which differs from drae by three
non-synonymous nucleotide changes, fails to bind collagen, and binding to daf and cea is resistant to cm
inhibition (nowicki et al., 1990; le bouguenec et al.,
1993; pettigrew et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006a).
moreover, we have recently demonstrated that point
mutations in the drae group result in variation in ceabinding phenotypes of the adhesins (korotkova et al.,
2006a).
in this study, we undertook a phylogenetic and functional analysis of the dr family of adhesins and determined two distinct patterns of structural variability, both
emerging under strong positive selection – one distinguished by the generation of highly divergent groups likely
driven by selection for antigenic diversity, and the other

distinguished by the generation of variants within groups
differing from each other by only a small number of point
mutations resulting in adaptive functional diversification of
the adhesins.

results
diversity in the dr family of e. coli adhesins
we sequenced dr family adhesin-encoding genes from
100 e. coli isolates and constructed a phylogenetic tree
in the form of an unrooted maximum-likelihood (ml)
dna phylogram (fig. 1). the analysis revealed eight distinct groups that are relatively distant from each other
phylogenetically and separated by long internal
branches on the tree (dotted lines). the primary (parent)
alleles of each group differ from each other by an
average nucleotide distance of 58% (17–96%) and an
average amino acid distance of 66% (24–91%), with the
amino acid changes distributed throughout the protein.
interestingly, recombination does not appear to be a
mechanism for generating the extensive variation
between groups of dr adhesins according to analysis of
dr adhesin primary alleles by recombination detection
program analysis (martin et al., 2005). the rates of nonsynonymous (dn) and synonymous (ds) nucleotide substitutions were calculated between the most closely
related primary group alleles (drbe-122 and afae-5).

group is derived from the published
designation of a member, if available, or of

each group, while the short branches show

182 n. korotkova et al.
both rates (dn = 0.132, ds = 0.326) were higher than
the corresponding rates observed in housekeeping
genes of e. coli (dn < 0.01, ds < 0.1) (boyd and hartl,
1998). furthermore, the dn/ds ratio for these dr adhesins (0.41) was significantly higher than in housekeeping
genes (0.1–0.01) (boyd and hartl, 1998).
sequence variability was seen within each group as
well, producing short branches from the primary alleles,
most of which were terminal or tip in nature. in contrast
to the high intergroup variability, intragroup genetic
diversification was only 0.5% (0–1.1%) at the nucleotide
level and 1.3% (0–3.1%) at the amino acid level, each
variant resulting from a small number of point mutations
(fig. 1). likewise, the intragroup values of dn
(0.002–0.009) and ds (0–0.02) were significantly lower
than the corresponding intergroup values, and were in a
range similar to housekeeping genes. however, the
remarkable overall predominance of non-synonymous
substitutions (66) over synonymous (3) substitutions is
an unambiguous indication of positive selection for
amino acid replacement.
evolution of the drae group
to understand the basis of the strong positive selection for
the intragroup point mutations in the molecular evolution
of the adhesins, we focused on the dr family group that
includes the drae adhesin (vaisanen-rhen, 1984; garcia
et al., 1994). we have chosen this group because it is a
relatively large group, and drae is functionally the most
diverse among the dr family adhesins. it binds daf,

ceacam family molecules, and type iv collagen, and
binding to these receptors is inhibited in the presence of
cm (nowicki et al., 1988; westerlund et al., 1989; berger
et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006a). in addition, drae is
a virulence factor in an animal model of uti (selvarangan
et al., 2004). all these attributes make the drae group an
attractive candidate for a combined molecular evolutionary and functional analysis.
genes comprising the drae group adhesins were
found in 25 strains and include 13 alleles differing in one
synonymous and 16 non-synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms and resulting in 12 naturally occurring
protein variants (fig. 2). the node that included drae
contained the largest number of representatives (14
strains). all strains comprising this node are clonally distinct by pulsed-field and microrestriction fragment gel
electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). the drae
node is considered to be parental, or primary, because it
is the largest node, it is central to the other nodes on the
phylogram, and it is the only node with a synonymous
mutation, indicating its relatively long-term evolutionary
stability, because accumulation of silent mutations
reflects the ‘molecular clock’. from the primary node,
eight secondary and three tertiary nodes have evolved
by one to four non-synonymous mutations. the 16:1
predominance of non-synonymous over synonymous
substitutions within the drae group indicates the
strength of positive selection for structural variation via
point mutation. another striking feature of the drae
group is the high frequency of structural mutational ‘hotspots’, i.e. amino acid positions where substitutions have

each node corresponds to a particular
structural variant, with the designations of the
corresponding representative isolates (or
previously published alleles). the central
consensus node includes two alleles – one
with 13 representatives and the other with a
single isolate – differentiated by a single
synonymous mutation. the structural mutation
hot-spots are underlined.

occurred more than once independently. of the 16 nonsynonymous mutations, 13 (81%) appeared in hot-spots
(positions d52,  xxxd61xxx , i85, t88, i111 and t131).
we compared the number of hot-spot mutations unique
to diarrhoeal or uti sources with the number of hot-spot
mutations found in strains from both sources, each averaged over all 11 structural variants arising from the central
drae variant (table 1). specific mutations were more
likely to be associated with a single pathogenic source
rather than distributed among sources (p = 0.021, t-test),
suggesting an adaptive advantage for the drae derivatives for specific pathogenic niches.
adhesive properties of e. coli expressing drae variants
to understand the functional consequences of variation in
the drae group, we analysed adhesive properties of
isogenic recombinant strains expressing drae variants
(table 2). the recombinant strains expressed the adhesin
variants at equivalent levels as determined by immunoblot
analysis of whole cell lysates using polyclonal antisera
prepared against drae (fig. 3).
we compared the abilities of the recombinant strains to
bind human red blood cells in a slide haemagglutination

lysates were separated by sds-page and transferred onto

assay. it has been previously shown that e. coli expressing dr adhesins agglutinate human erythrocytes and bind
epithelial cells as a result of bacterial attachment to daf
present on the cell surfaces, and drae-mediated binding
to daf is inhibited by cm (nowicki et al., 1988). when the
recombinant strains expressing drae variants were incubated with human erythrocytes on agglutination slides in
standard conditions of 150 mm nacl, in the presence and
absence of 5 mm cm, the strains showed variability
in agglutination behaviour (table 2). e. coli expressing
the jjb30 (t131n),  xxxg2152xxx  (i85m,t131a) and  xxxg2076xxx 
(g68d,t88m) alleles demonstrated the highest titres in
the slide-haemagglutination assay in the absence of cm,
cm had different effects on erythrocyte agglutination
mediated by the variant adhesins expressed in recombinant strains. the haemagglutination abilities mediated by
two variants were completely insensitive to cm, including
afae-3 (d52n,t88m,i111t) as previously reported (le
bouguenec et al., 1993). haemagglutination mediated by
strains expressing jjb17 (i111t) and jjb30 (t131n)
variant adhesins was partially resistant to cm, while the
other variants did not agglutinate erythrocytes in the presence of 5 mm cm.

184 n. korotkova et al.
high salt concentrations (400–800 mm nacl) and low
ph are conditions typical of the urinary tract (brauner
et al., 1990). recently we demonstrated that salt dramatically reduces the drae–daf binding affinity, suggesting
that e. coli adherence to daf mediated by drae would be
inhibited in the urinary tract (korotkova et al., 2006b).
when we incubated the recombinant strains expressing
drae variants with human erythrocytes on agglutination
slides in the presence of 800 mm nacl, the haemagglutination of all e. coli strains was completely abrogated
except for bacteria expressing variants giving the highest
titers in standard conditions [jjb30 (t131n),  xxxg2152xxx 
(i85m,t131a),  xxxg2076xxx  (g68d,t88m)], and two additional
variants,  xxxg2099xxx  (d61g,i111t) and  xxxg2100xxx  (d52n,d61g)
(table 2). notably, all of the variants agglutinating
erythrocytes in 800 mm nacl were isolated from strains
associated with uti.
the observed haemagglutination phenotypes in
150 mm nacl corresponded in general with the ability of
the variant alleles to mediate bacterial adherence to t24
human bladder epithelial cells, suggesting that daf is the
relevant receptor for dr adhesins in the t24 cell binding
assay (table 2). consistent with these observations,
expression of ceacams, also receptors for dr adhesins,
was not detected by western blot analysis of t24 cells
(data not shown). all strains expressing drae alleles were
able to bind to 90–100% of t24 cells, whereas the parent
strain with a premature stop codon in drae did not
bind to the cells. three variants mediating the highest
haemagglutination titers,  xxxg2076xxx  (g68d,t88m),  xxxg2152xxx 
(i85m,t131a) and jjb30 (t131n), also mediated adherence of the greatest number of bacteria per t24 cell
(table 2).
the ability to mediate bacterial adherence to type iv
collagen was lost by six drae variants including afae-3
(d52n,t88m,i111t) as previously reported (carnoy and
moseley, 1997). three variants,  xxxg2099xxx  (d61g,i111t),
293 (t88a) and jjb17 (i111t), demonstrated reduced
ability to bind cea in the cea-binding assay relative to
the parent adhesin (table 2).
surface plasmon resonance analysis of drae
binding to daf
the altered binding phenotypes of bacteria expressing
drae variants could be due to changes in the affinities of
the ligand–receptor interactions. in order to test this
hypothesis we investigated daf binding by surface
plasmon resonance (spr) by flowing soluble daf over
purified variant fimbriae immobilized on the sensor
surface. the interaction between drae and daf was of
low affinity with very fast on and off rates. figure 4 presents a drae–daf sensogram (a) and a fit of these data
(b) as an example of affinity evaluation in spr analysis.

spr results for adhesin – daf interactions with other
alleles are similar and characterized by fast on and off
rates. affinity data are summarized in table 3. the
kd = 12.2 mm of daf binding to afae-3 fimbriae is in
agreement with previously reported affinities for selfcomplemented monomer and strand-swapped trimer
forms of afae-3 (10–16 mm) (anderson et al., 2004; pettigrew et al., 2004). steady state affinities of drae variants
for daf corresponded to haemagglutination and epithelial
cell-binding phenotypes of bacteria expressing the adhesins (table 3). variants which mediated the highest level of
binding to t24 epithelial cells showed the greatest affinity
to daf in spr analyses. jjb30 (t131n) was the
strongest binding variant among the tested adhesins,
demonstrating a 30-fold higher affinity to daf relative
to the ancestral drae adhesin.
when 1 mm cm was included with daf, inhibitory
effects were essentially consistent with haemagglutination inhibition assays with the affinities decreased 10-fold
in drae,  xxxg2076xxx  (g68d,t88m), 297 (i85m), 252
(a92t,i111v) and jjb30 (t131n) variants.
to test the effect of salt concentration on daf–adhesin
affinity, spr experiments were conducted in buffer containing 800 mm nacl. in agreement with our earlier observations (korotkova et al., 2006b), salt inhibited binding of
drae adhesin to daf. variants with increased affinity relative to drae in 150 mm nacl, jjb30 (t131n),  xxxg2152xxx 
(i85m,t131a) and  xxxg2076xxx  (g68d,t88m) (table 3),
showed reduced daf affinity in 800 mm nacl (data not
shown), but still demonstrated increased binding relative
to the parent drae, consistent with their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes in high salt conditions (table 2).  xxxg2099xxx 
(d61g,i111t) and  xxxg2100xxx  (d52n,d61g), which displayed
daf affinities similar to drae in 150 mm nacl (table 3),
were not as sensitive to inhibition by nacl, and showed
increased affinity at 800 mm nacl relatively to drae (data
not shown), consistent with the ability of these variants to
agglutinate erythrocytes in high salt (table 2).
surface plasmon resonance analysis of drae binding to
 xxxg426xxx , ceacam3 and ceacam6
recently we have demonstrated that drae binds the
n-domain of cea,  xxxg426xxx  and ceacam6 (korotkova
et al., 2006a). spr analysis of n-cea binding by variants
of the drae group revealed variation in cea-binding phenotypes of the adhesins (korotkova et al., 2006a) (ceabinding data from the previous study are shown in table 3
for comparison). we wished to extend the spr studies to
the other ceacam receptors of dr adhesins,  xxxg426xxx 
and ceacam6. however,  xxxg426xxx  affinities to drae
variants could not be estimated with confidence because
 xxxg426xxx  tends to self association (manuscript in preparation), and as a result the binding curve did not fit a

monovalent 1:1 interaction model (not shown). to analyse
binding of drae variants to  xxxg426xxx , the n-domain of
 xxxg426xxx  was immobilized on the sensor surface, and
purified dr fimbriae were injected to flow over the sensor
surface as analyte. a sensogram of the interaction of
n- xxxg426xxx  with drae fimbriae is shown in fig. 4c. the
binding is characterized by a rapidly rising slope upon
injection, then a rapid decrease in signal that does not fall
to baseline, but rather slowly decays. we found that only
one drae variant, 293 (t88a) failed to demonstrate
binding to n- xxxg426xxx .
ceacam6 binding to drae variants were studied by
spr by flowing n-ceacam6 over purified variant fimbriae immobilized on the sensor surface. dissociation
constants from n-ceacam6 were calculated for all drae
variants (table 3). we found that the previously reported
cea-binding activity of some variants did not correspond
to n-ceacam6 binding activity (table 3, cea data from
the previous study shown for comparison). afae-3

(d52m,t88m,i111t) and 252 (a92t,i111v), which did not
differ from drae in cea binding, failed to bind ceacam6.
figure 4d presents the spr sensogram showing failure
of afae-3 to bind ceacam6. these observations demonstrate that specific point mutations can cause different
effects on binding to the different ceacam receptors.
as the n-terminal domains of ceacam6 and
ceacam3 are identical in the regions predicted to be
involved in drae binding (korotkova et al., 2006a), we
hypothesized that dr adhesins bind ceacam3 also,
despite observations that ceacam3 does not serve as a
receptor for bacterial adherence to cells (berger et al.,
2004). first, the affinity of ceacam3–drae interactions
was calculated by spr analysis by flowing ceacam3
over drae fimbriae immobilized on the sensor surface.
we found that ceacam3 binds drae, but the interactions
are characterized by very low affinity (100 mm). when
n-ceacam3 was immobilized to the sensor chip as
ligand and purified dr fimbriae were injected to flow over

the sensor surface as analyte, a rising slope in the resonance signal was detected. after injection, the resonance
signal decreased slowly to baseline, indicating specific
binding of these fimbriae to ceacam3 (fig. 4e). no
binding was observed for four adhesins, afae-3
(d52m,t88m,i111t),  xxxg2099xxx  (d61g,i111t), jjb17 (i111t)
and 293 (t88a).

drae binding to type iv collagen
we also investigated the interaction of drae-related
adhesins with type iv collagen by spr analysis. type iv
collagen was immobilized on the sensor surface, and
purified dr fimbriae were injected to flow over the sensor
surface as an analyte. again, results were consistent with
bacterial binding phenotypes. during the injection of
drae,  xxxg2100xxx  (d52n,d61g), 297 (i85m),  xxxg2152xxx 
(i85m,t131a), jjb30 (t131n) and 252 (a92t,i111v) fimbriae, a rising slope in the resonance signal was evident
(see drae binding curve as an example in fig. 4f).
after injection, the resonance signal decreased very
slowly, indicating that fimbriae bind to type iv collagen to
form a stable complex. however, no change in the
resonance signal was detectable when the afae-3
(d52m,t88m,i111t),  xxxg2099xxx  (d61g,i111t), jjb17
(i111t),  xxxg2076xxx  (g68d,t88m), 513 (t88m) and 293
(t88a) adhesins were injected, indicating the absence of
detectable binding.
as both ligand and analyte are multimeric, the spr data
do not permit the determination of kinetic and equilibrium
values describing the intermolecular interactions of drae
variants with type iv collagen. to obtain more quantitative
information regarding affinities, we further investigated
collagen binding of those variants shown to bind collagen
by spr, drae,  xxxg2100xxx  (d52n,d61g), 297 (i85m),  xxxg2152xxx 
(i85m,t131a), jjb30 (t131n) and 252 (a92t,i111v), by
semiquantitative immunoassay. dilutions of a solution of
type iv collagen were used to coat microtiter plate wells.
fimbriae were added and bound protein was detected
with anti-dr fimbriae antisera. the concentrations of collagen mediating 50% adhesin binding were compared
between collagen-binding drae variants (table 3). drae
and  xxxg2152xxx  (i85m,t131a) adhesins showed a similar level
of collagen binding while 297 (i85m) and  xxxg2100xxx 
(d52n,d61g) showed slightly increased binding.
however, the binding of 252 (a92t,i111v) adhesin to collagen was significantly reduced.

mutagenesis and supported by structural studies (van loy
et al., 2002b; anderson et al., 2004; korotkova et al.,
2006a,b) (fig. 5). here, this observation was extended to
the other groups of dr adhesins as well. daf and ceacam
binding sites of dr adhesins encoded by the primary allele
of each of the eight groups were predicted by amino acid
sequence alignment with drae (fig. 5). there were 44
amino acid positions at which intragroup amino acid substitutions occurred. substitutions are more likely to occur
within predicted cea and daf binding sites (p = 0.0007,
fisher exact test) than outside of the regions. of these 44
sites, 17 (39%) amino acid positions are located in the

predicted cea binding site, and 7 (16%) are located in the
predicted daf binding site. as with the drae group, other
groups demonstrated structural ‘hot-spots’, i.e. amino acid
positions where substitutions have occurred more than
once independently. we found that 13 amino acid positions
have more than one substitution and that almost half of the
‘hot-spots’ are located in the cea binding surface (six
positions) (fig. 5), suggesting that ceacam receptors
play important roles in the functional evolution of the dr
family of adhesins. overall, these observations suggest
that the positive selection for functional variation demonstrated in the drae group also drives the evolution of the
other dr adhesin groups.

discussion
in summary, we have shown that the dr family of adhesins
is comprised of groups with extensive structural variation
suggestive of diversifying selection for antigenic variation.
we further show that evolution within the drae group
occurs as a result of exceptionally strong positive selection for functional variation of adhesive properties, providing strong evidence for the role of dr adhesins in niche
adaptation of e. coli expressing these structures. thus,
occurrence of point structural changes in highly variable
surface protein antigens of bacterial pathogens can be
indicative of selection for pathoadaptive functional modification of these proteins.
the dr family of adhesins is comprised of a number of
groups demonstrating extensive intergroup structural
diversity, with rates of both non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions significantly exceeding housekeeping
genes of e. coli. recombination detection program
analysis (martin et al., 2005) failed to provide strong evidence for recombination between dr alleles suggesting
that there is selection only for the transfer of the entire
gene, as seen, for example, in the ospc serotypes of
borrelia burgdorferi (dykhuizen and baranton, 2001),
rather than for intragenic recombinants as with fima,
which encodes the pilin subunit of e. coli type 1 fimbriae
(peek et al., 2001). theoretically, such diversity between
dr adhesins from different groups could emerge due to a
massive accumulation of small genetic changes in evolutionarily related, homologous genes over an exceptionally
long-term period or, alternatively, convergent evolution of
similar adhesive and structural functions in evolutionarily
unrelated, non-homologous genes. the homology
between the different dr adhesins suggests that they
share a common ancestor and so have not evolved by
convergent evolution from evolutionarily unrelated nonhomologous genes. the other, non-structural, genes in
the gene clusters that encode dr adhesins from different
groups are 99% similar (servin, 2005). thus even though
the differences between dr groups are likely to represent
the accumulation of changes over a long period of time,
the present clusters are constructed by recent recombination of the dr adhesins into the cluster.
for analysis of evolution of dr adhesins within groups,
we focused on the drae group. the predominance of
non-synonymous over silent changes is evidence of very
strong positive selection for variation. given the lack of
observed intragenic recombination in dr adhesins, the
mutational variation within the group could be a mechanism for structural variation driven by selection for
immune escape. however, this is unlikely considering that
variant alleles have diverged from the primary allele by
mostly single mutations that would not be expected to
produce major antigenic changes. instead, we demon-

strated by binding analysis that every structural variant
evolving from the ancestral drae adhesin is functionally
altered in its adhesive properties (fig. 6). these results
suggest that selection for modification of binding function
is an important aspect of adaptive evolution for the dr
family of adhesins.
positive selection for functional variation in the evolution
of bacterial adhesins associated with uti has previously
been demonstrated for the fimh adhesin of mannosespecific type 1 fimbriae (sokurenko et al., 2004; weissman
et al., 2006). e. coli strains isolated from uti possess fimh
alleles which have accumulated point mutations resulting
in enhanced affinity for monomannose-containing glycoconjugates, structures abundant in the uroepithelium, and
increased virulence in a mouse model of uti (sokurenko
et al., 1998). interestingly, selection for point mutations in
the dr adhesin appears to be much stronger than for fimh,
based on a more dramatic predominance of nonsynonymous over synonymous mutations on all terminal
branches. one important characteristic feature of adaptive
mutations is their specific preferential positions in the
protein as indicated by the high frequency of nonsynonymous hot-spots (hughes and nei, 1988). the drae
group demonstrates a number of hot-spot mutations and
there is a correlation of mutation position with the origin of
isolate (table 1). several of these hot-spots are at sites
previously associated with binding function through
genetic and structural studies. drae amino acid positions
 xxxd61xxx ,  xxxg68xxx  and t131 are likely to be located in the daf
binding region of drae (van loy et al., 2002b; anderson
et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006b). here, we found that
drae variants isolated from uropathogenic strains with
amino acid substitutions d61g, g68d, t131n and t131a
demonstrated increased affinity to daf (fig. 6). we
believe that these mutations may be adaptive because
although daf is abundant in the uroepithelium (medof
et al., 1987), the affinity of drae for daf is significantly
reduced in 800 mm nacl (korotkova et al., 2006b). therefore in the conditions of high osmolarity found in the urinary
tract the enhanced capability of the drae variants to
adhere to epithelial cells via daf could represent adaptation to that pathogenic niche. indeed, here we demonstrate
that 800 mm nacl completely inhibits haemagglutination
mediated by drae-fimbriated e. coli. however the drae
variants with amino acid substitutions d61g, g68d, t131n
and t131a have acquired the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes in high salt concentration (table 2). these observations support the hypothesis that the acquisition of
increased affinity for daf as measured by spr analysis
has biological relevance for uropathogenesis. interestingly, we see two mechanisms associated with the
increased ability of uropathogens to bind daf in high salt.

binding exhibited by the parental drae [as reflected in the
sensitivity of binding to nacl (korotkova et al., 2006b)], but
show increased daf affinity relative to drae at low and
high salt concentrations. variants  xxxg2099xxx  (d61g,i111t)
and  xxxg2100xxx  (d52n,d61g) show affinity for daf similar to
that of the parental drae at low salt, but appear to have lost
sensitivity to nacl, resulting in increased affinity relative to
drae at high salt. it is likely that the d61g mutation has
disrupted the concentration of negative charge on the
adhesin surface associated with nacl sensitivity (korotkova et al., 2006b).
the cm-binding pocket of drae has been defined by
structural studies (pettigrew et al., 2004). the frequency
of amino acid substitutions in the cm-binding pocket of
drae adhesins (positions t88 and i111), and the
simultaneous presence of two particular mutations in
afae-3 (t88m and i111t) (carnoy and moseley, 1997)
with the binding data presented here indicate that the
molecular evolution of the family leads to decreased
sensitivity of daf binding to cm inhibition. interestingly,
drae variants with no sensitivity to cm were isolated
only from uropathogenic strains (fig. 6). we speculate
that cm may be structurally related to a soluble binding
inhibitor encountered in the natural environment of bacteria expressing dr adhesins. resistance to cm inhibi-

tion of daf binding may correlate with resistance to an
inhibitor, thus enhancing the adhesive potential of bacteria expressing cm-resistant variants. alternatively, it is
possible that the inhibition of dr adhesin binding by cm
may be simply a laboratory phenomenon with no relevance to natural inhibitors, and loss of the property
may be a structural consequence of loss of ceacam/
collagen iv binding in the evolution of increased dafbinding affinity (see below).
cea,  xxxg426xxx  and ceacam6 have recently been
identified as receptors for the dr family of adhesins
(berger et al., 2004; korotkova et al., 2006a). in this
study we have demonstrated that some drae variants
bind ceacam3. ceacam3–drae affinity is the lowest
among members of ceacam family. it has been shown
that dr fimbriated e. coli do not bind cho or hela cells
expressing ceacam3, but elicit recruitment of the
ceacam3 around hela cell-adherent bacteria (berger
et al., 2004). weak interactions of dr adhesins with
ceacam3 may not permit tight attachment of bacteria
to eukaryotic cells, but they may be strong enough to
recruit ceacam3 to bacteria bound to other receptors
such as daf. ceacam molecules are expressed on
numerous cells including epithelial, endothelial and
myeloid cells (prall et al., 1996; baranov and hammar-

strom, 2004; oliveira-ferrer et al., 2004). they may play
a role in bacterial colonization of human epithelial cells
and in modulating the host immune responses associated with bacterial infection (gray-owen and blumberg,
2006). in a previous study we identified the cea binding
site on drae, which partially overlaps with cm and
collagen-binding sites (korotkova et al., 2006a). we
found that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions
in drae and other dr adhesin groups are located in the
cea binding site (fig. 5), suggesting a significant role of
ceacam receptors in e. coli adaptation to host environment. the drae group accumulates several amino acid
substitutions, namely in i111, t88 and i85, which lead to
variation in cea-binding phenotypes of the adhesins
(korotkova et al., 2006a). interestingly, dr adhesin
binding to ceacam6 and ceacam3 tends to be lost
during drae evolution. ceacam6 and ceacam3 are
expressed on neutrophils and ceacam3 is involved in
opsonin-independent phagocytosis of ceacam-binding
neisseria, moraxella and haemophilus species (mccaw
et al., 2003; schmitter et al., 2004). we suggest that
selection against ceacam binding could be due to (i)
antibacterial host defences involving interaction with
ceacam receptors expressed on immune cells (mccaw
et al., 2003; schmitter et al., 2004); and/or (ii) adhesin
adaptation to resistance to soluble inhibitors which bind
the hydrophobic pocket involving the i111 and t88 positions, because the cm and ceacam binding surfaces
overlap (korotkova et al., 2006a).
the role of type iv collagen binding in bacterial infections
mediated by e. coli expressing drae adhesins is not clear.
type iv collagen is not present at the apical domain of
polarized epithelial cells, the site of e. coli colonization
(louvard et al., 1992). however, the tropism of drae family
of adhesins to basement membrane renal interstitium,
which may become exposed as a consequence of bacterial
or inflammatory damage to the epithelial surface, has been
proposed to be important for chronicity of infection,
because these substructures in the kidney have abundant
type iv collagen as well as daf (westerlund et al., 1989).
this possibility is supported by recent observations utilizing an experimental mouse model of chronic pyelonephritis
(selvarangan et al., 2004). however, other members of the
dr family of adhesins associated with uti and pyelonephritis do not bind type iv collagen. furthermore, data presented in the current study suggest that collagen binding
tends to be lost in the process of adaptive selection which
characterizes the evolution of the drae subgroup. we
suggest that loss of the collagen-binding capability of dr
adhesins might be a trade-off resulting in reduced sensitivity of daf binding to soluble inhibitors, or reduced affinity
to other receptors such as ceacams. the presence of two
collagen-eliminating mutations (i111t and t88m) in afae-3
supports this suggestion. genetic adaptation to one envi-

ronment is often associated with loss of fitness in other
environments (weissman et al., 2003).
point mutations can alter recognition of individual
epitopes by specific antibodies (cooreman et al., 2001;
kalia et al., 2005; tzitzilonis et al., 2006), and it is impossible to completely exclude the possibility that the point
mutations appearing within dr groups are selected for by
escape from the immune response. however, we believe
that this is rather unlikely, because (i) in most cases, only a
single point mutation is found in the intragroup variants,
with no evidence for accumulation of the multiple mutations
one would expect under continuous immune pressure; (ii)
point mutations are not scattered across the surface
epitopes in the dr adhesin, but rather concentrated within
the putative binding sites; (iii) point mutations affect dr
function in what appears to be a pathogenicity-adaptive
manner; and (iv) single point mutations have been shown
to be functionally adaptive for bacterial adhesins in
mannose-specific type 1 fimbriae – fimh, but not common
in the major antigen of same fimbriae – the fima pilin
protein (sokurenko et al., 1997; 1998; 2004; weissman
et al., 2006). it might be argued that hypervariability in the
receptor-binding sites may be under immune-escape pressure to avoid those antibodies that would specifically block
binding to host tissues, and that alteration of binding function is an accidental consequence of this process. indeed,
the observation of hypervariability in the daf binding site
of the echovirus capsid protein has been interpreted in this
manner (pettigrew et al., 2006). this is unlikely in the case
of fimbrial adhesins studied here because we observe a
directionality in the selection of mutations in the drae
group tending towards the loss of sensitivity to soluble
inhibitors and increased affinity for daf.
thus, our data indicate that functional adaptation
should be considered as the likely basis for selection of
point mutations in major antigenic proteins on the bacterial surface, instead of, or in addition to, selection by
immune escape. consequently, the presence of a specific
pattern of point mutations in a protein with yet unknown
functional properties (whether or not the protein is a major
antigen) could be indicative that such a protein carries out
specific functions, e.g. ligand receptor properties or enzymatic activity, under selection for variation.

experimental procedures
bacterial strains, plasmids, eukaryotic cell lines
escherichia coli possessing dr adhesin-related genes as
determined by pcr analysis (zhang et al., 1997) or dna
hybridization (bilge et al., 1989) were obtained from existing
collections of strains isolated from faeces of healthy infants,
diarrhoeal stools, urine and blood (johnson et al., 1988; bilge
et al., 1989; zhang et al., 1997; sokurenko et al., 2004).

functional diversity in e. coli dr adhesins 191
1997) was used as a host strain for the expression of dr
adhesin variants. strain aaec does not express type 1 fimbriae (blomfield et al., 1991). puc-cm was used as a cloning
vector for the expression of dr adhesin variants. derivatives
of puc-cm were grown in the presence of 25 mg  xxxg1167xxx  cm.
derivatives of pcc90-d54stop were grown in 100 mg  xxxg1167xxx 
ampicillin. the human bladder epithelial cell line t24 (atcc
htb-4) was grown in mccoy’s 5 a medium supplemented
with 10% fbs, penicillin and streptomycin, and cultured
according to standard tissue culture techniques. enzymes
were purchased from new england biolabs (beverly, ma)
and used as recommended by the manufacturer. all constructs were confirmed by sequencing using big dye terminator method and abi sequencing (pe applied biosystems,
foster city, ca).

sequence analysis of dr adhesin variants and
construction of recombinant plasmids
for sequence analysis, the full-length adhesin-encoding
genes of drae subtype were amplified from the clinical
isolates by pcr with the following primers: drae-f:
gacagcttactgattctgggatg and drae-r: gccagcg
ggtgattggtgcc. to investigate the adhesive phenotypes of new structural variants of drae, recombinant
strains expressing dr fimbriae were constructed. genes
encoding drae-related adhesins of interest were amplified
by using the following primers: drae-bamhi: cgaggatcc
gaaggagatatacatatgaaaaaattagcgatcatggcc,
and drae-psti: cacgcacgtcctgcagtcattttgccc
agtaacc. pcr products were digested with bamhi and
psti and inserted into bamhi and psti restriction sites of
puc-cm. the resulting plasmids were transformed into
e. coli 191 a (pcc90-d54stop). this strain contains the
necessary genes of the dra operon for fimbrial expression,
with a premature stop codon at codon 54 within drae.

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and microrestriction
fingerprinting
comparisons of genomes using pulsed-field and microrestriction fingerprinting were performed as previously
described (davis et al., 2003) using restriction enzymes xbai
and avrii for pulsed-field and sau3ai and haeiii for microrestriction analysis.

phylogenetic analysis
maximum-likelihood unrooted dna phylograms were constructed using paup* 4.0b (david swofford, sinauer
associates, sunderland, ma). to analyse the drae group, an
unrooted dna ml phylogram for the group was created
separately. the synonymously differentiated alleles were collapsed in a single node, denoting a single structural variant.
thereby the dna tree was transformed to a protein tree with
two types of nodes (or structural variants) – the central
multiple-allele node and the peripheral single-allele nodes
(sokurenko et al., 2004). the ratio of the rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was computed
using dnasp 4.00 (rozas et al., 2003).

purification of dr adhesins
structural variants of drae fimbriae were purified from the
recombinant strains described above. bacteria were grown in
2 l of lb at 37°c for 4–6 h. fimbriae expression was induced
with 1 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the cultures were incubated overnight at 30°c. the cultures were
centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min and the pellets were resuspended in 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8), 150 mm nacl. the bacterial suspension was subjected to mechanical shearing by
homogenizer pro 200 (pro scientific, oxford, ct) to
remove the fimbriae and the cells were pelleted at 14 000 g
for 20 min. the fimbriae were precipitated from the supernatant with 20–30% ammonium sulphate and pelleted at
14 000 g for 30 min. the pellet was resuspended in hbs-e
buffer [10 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 3 mm edta]
and purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a superdex 200 column (amersham corporation, piscataway, nj) in
the same buffer.

purification of daf
decay-accelerating factor containing complement control
protein domains 2, 3 and 4 and an oligohistidine tag at the
c-terminal end (daf234) was expressed in pichia pastoris
and purified from the supernatant of induced cultures by
ni-nta chromatography as described previously (van loy
et al., 2002b). for spr experiments the protein was then
purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a superdex
200 column (amersham) in hbs-e buffer.

purification of n-domain of  xxxg426xxx , ceacam3
and ceacam6
the recombinant strains expressing n-domain of  xxxg426xxx 
and ceacam6 were described previously (korotkova et al.,
2006a). the sequence corresponding to the mature amino
acid sequence of ceacam3 was pcr amplified using cdna
clone (image id: 40015072; open biosystems) as a template
and inserted into pet-21d (novagen). the proteins were
expressed in e. coli bl21 (de3) and purified from inclusion
bodies. the inclusion bodies were dissolved overnight in
buffer containing 30 mm tris/hcl (ph 8.5), 150 mm nacl,
1 mm edta and 8 m urea. one volume of the protein sample
was added slowly to 20 vols of buffer containing 50 mm
ches (ph 9.2) and 500 mm arginine, and the sample was
left overnight at 4°c. the refolded protein was concentrated
by ultrafiltration and purified by gel-filtration using a superdex
75 column (amersham) in 30 mm tris/hcl (ph 8.5), 150 mm
nacl. calibration of the column was performed using gelfiltration markers (amersham).

type iv collagen-binding immunoassay
type iv collagen (sigma-aldrich) was dissolved in 0.02 m
bicarbonate buffer and bound to 96-well microtiter plate at a
~102 dilution series, i.e. 0.3–40 mg  xxxg1167xxx , for 1 h at 37°c. the
wells were then washed three times with 0.01 m phosphatebuffered saline (pbs, ph 7.2) and quenched with 0.1% bsa.
the blocking solution was removed and 100 ml of the purified

adhesin was added at a concentration 10 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in pbs
containing 0.1% bsa and incubated for 1 h at 37°c. this
concentration had been determined in preliminary experiments to be optimal for maximum binding. following washes
with pbs, the bound adhesin proteins were detected with
anti-dr fimbriae antisera (carnoy and moseley, 1997) at
1:100 dilution. the wells were washed and 1:4000 dilution of
goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody
(pierce, rockford, il) was added for 30 min at 37°c. the
bound antibodies were detected with turbo tmb reagent
(bio-rad, hercules, ca) as described by the manufacturer.

t24 cell adherence assays
t24 cells were split into 24 well plates with glass coverslips
and grown to confluence. before the assay, cells were
washed twice with hanks’ balanced saline solution and incubated with fresh medium without antibiotics and without fbs
for 1 h. the bacterial strains were grown overnight on lb
medium and harvested and resuspended in pbs to
od540 = 0.6. the bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in the tissue culture medium. then 0.1 ml of each
bacterial strain was added to each well. the adherence assay
was performed as described previously (van loy et al.,
2002a,b) and repeated in triplicate.

type iv collagen and cea bacterial adherence assays
bacteria were examined for the ability to bind type iv collagen
from human placenta (sigma-aldrich) and cea (xema,
moscow, russia) by a growth assay as previously described
(van loy et al., 2002b). briefly, plates were coated with type
iv collagen at a concentration of 15 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in pbs or cea at
a concentration of 1 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in pbs. the bacterial strains
were grown overnight in lb at 37°c. the cells were then
pelleted and resuspended in pbs and adjusted to
od540 = 4.0. fifty microlitres of each of the bacterial strain
suspensions was added to a microtiter plate well together
with 50 ml of pbs containing 0.2% bsa and allowed to bind
for 1 h at 37°c. unbound bacteria were removed by washing
with pbs and then 150 ml of sb medium was added to each
well. the plate was incubated with shaking at 37°c for 2 h.
the resulting growth was then measured at od540.

haemagglutination assay
haemagglutination of blood group o human erythrocytes
obtained from a healthy volunteer was performed following
published protocols (carnoy and moseley, 1997). inhibition of
haemagglutination by cm was examined by the addition of
5 mm cm to the erythrocyte suspension prior to the assay. to
test the effect of high salt concentration on haemagglutination
mediated by e. coli, the bacterial strains and erythrocytes
were resuspended in 10 mm hepes buffer (ph 7.4) with
800 mm nacl. the titre was defined as the highest dilution of
bacterial cells resulting in haemagglutination.

surface plasmon resonance studies
unless otherwise stated, spr measurements were carried
out in running buffer: hbs-ep buffer [10 mm hepes

(ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 3 mm edta, 0.005% p-20 surfactant
(biacore ab, uppsala, sweden)] using a biacore 3000
system (biacore ab). to analyse the interaction between
dr fimbriae and daf, n-ceacam6, n-ceacam3 or
n- xxxg426xxx , adhesins were immobilized on a cm5
research-grade sensor chip (biacore ab) by amine coupling
chemistry, using the manufacturer’s protocols. immobilization
of 100–300 response units (ru) resulted in optimal
responses for subsequent analyses. each analyte was dissolved in running buffer and analysed using a ~102 dilution
series, i.e. daf (2–200 mm), n-ceacam6 and n-ceacam3
(4–400 mm) and n- xxxg426xxx  (2–200 mm). analyte was
injected over the surface at a flow rate of 20 ml min-1 for
2 min. average equilibrium responses were measured for six
to seven concentrations of the analyte.
for competition experiments, cm was dissolved in ethanol
at a concentration of 300 mm before spr analysis. the
running buffer contained 1 mm of cm. ethanol concentration
was adjusted for each cm concentration and the blanks. daf
was dissolved in the buffer as described above.
to determine effect of high salt concentration on the
binding constants of dr adhesin–daf interactions, the
running buffer included 800 mm nacl. daf for injection was
prepared in each buffer so that the running buffer and daf
sample buffer were identical.
raw sensograms were corrected using the doublesubtraction protocol (myszka, 1999), in which the signal in the
experimental flowcell is corrected by the signal in the reference flowcell as well as an average of signal from four corrected blank buffer injections. the resulting data were
analysed with biaevaluation 3.0 software (biacore) to
globally fit data and derive equilibrium values. reported kds
are derived from analysis of equilibrium signal from at least
three analyte injections at each of the tested analyte
concentrations. error estimates were propagated from standard error of fit of the equilibrium affinity constant (ka).
to analyse the interaction between dr fimbriae and
ceacam3,  xxxg426xxx  or type iv collagen,  xxxg426xxx ,
ceacam3 or type iv collagen were immobilized on a cm5
research-grade sensor chip by amine coupling chemistry.
immobilization of 300–1000 ru resulted in optimal
responses for subsequent analyses. different concentrations
of dr fimbriae (2–0.1 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) were injected over the surface
at a flow rate of 20 ml min-1 and the surface was regenerated
by 25 ml of 0.1 mm hcl at a flow rate of 100 ml min-1 after
each injection.
