sibutramine is a widely used antiobesity drug. in acute studies, the
peripheral sympathomimetic effect of sibutramine was counteracted
by a central sympatholytic action.
objective: the objective was to test the hypothesis that blood pressure responses to long-term sibutramine therapy may be related to
sympathetic nerve traffic before treatment in a prospective open-label
study in an academic clinical research center.
patients: this study comprised 20 obese subjects (body mass index,
30 – 40 kg/m2; age, 30 –57 yr) receiving 5 d of placebo treatment followed by open-label 15 mg/d sibutramine and hypocaloric diet over 12
wk.
main outcome measures: body weight, blood pressure, heart rate,

he serotonin and  xxxg2148xxx 
(net) inhibitor sibutramine is a widely used antiobesity drug that mediates increased satiety (1, 2). a mildly
elevated energy expenditure may also contribute to weight
loss. theoretically, net inhibition with sibutramine could
induce or worsen arterial hypertension. yet in a recent analysis of two placebo-controlled trials, sibutramine did not
elicit a major pressor response (3). the observation may be
explained by the complex effect of sibutramine on the sympathetic nervous system. net inhibition in peripheral tissues
tends to increase norepinephrine overflow (4). however,
net blockade in the brain attenuates sympathetic outflow
through activation of ␣-2 adrenoreceptors (5). indeed, sibutramine ingestion over a few days attenuates the pressor
response to sympathetic stimuli in normal-weight subjects
(6) and decreases centrally generated sympathetic activity
more than 50% in obese subjects (7). the central nervous
sympatholytic effect may attenuate sibutramine’s peripheral
stimulatory actions. the mechanism may be particularly relfirst published online february 6, 2007

plasma catecholamines, and adipose tissue gene expression were
measured.
results: open-label sibutramine treatment decreased body weight
4.1 kg (p ⬍ 0.01) and msna 17 bursts per minute (p ⫽ 0.001), and
increased diastolic blood pressure 3 mm hg (p ⬍ 0.05) and heart rate
8 bpm (p ⬍ 0.01). the change in blood pressure with sibutramine
treatment was inversely correlated with initial msna (r2 ⫽ 0.34; p
⬍ 0.01). chronic sibutramine treatment increased adrenoreceptor
gene expression and plasma catecholamines.
conclusions: the blood pressure response to sibutramine treatment
is related to initial msna so that subjects with higher msna exhibit
a smaller increase or even a decrease in blood pressure. the phenomenon might be explained by a sustained reduction in central
sympathetic activity with sibutramine treatment. (j clin endocrinol metab 92: 1560 –1563, 2007)

evant in patients with raised sympathetic activity. we tested
the hypothesis that the blood pressure response to chronic
sibutramine is related to sympathetic activity before treatment. moreover, we measured plasma catecholamines and
adrenoreceptor gene expression in adipose tissue before and
during sibutramine treatment.
patients and methods
we recruited 20 obese patients from our obesity clinic and through
a press release (seven men, 13 women; age, 42 ⫾ 2 yr; body mass index,
35 ⫾ 0.7 kg/m2). patients with secondary causes of obesity, diabetes
mellitus, and other serious comorbid conditions were excluded. written
informed consent was obtained before study entry. the institutional
review board approved all studies.
patients underwent an initial cardiovascular evaluation including
measurements of sympathetic activity and an adipose tissue biopsy after
5 d of treatment with placebo. respiration and electrocardiogram were
measured continuously (cardioscreen; medis gmbh, ilmenau, germany). arterial blood pressure was determined as the mean of three
supine measurements with an automated oscillometric brachial cuff
(dinamap; critikon, newport, uk). muscle sympathetic nerve activity
(msna) was recorded from the right peroneal nerve with a unipolar
tungsten electrode as described previously (8, 9).
after the cardiovascular evaluation, we treated all patients for 3
months with 15 mg/d sibutramine in an open-label fashion. patients
received dietary advice from a dietitian before and monthly during the
study (600 kcal/d caloric deficit). we determined supine blood pressure
and heart rate during each visit. patients with an increase in blood

discussion

we tested the hypothesis that centrally generated sympathetic activity influences the cardiovascular response to longterm sibutramine treatment. msna before treatment and the
blood pressure response during sibutramine treatment were
inversely correlated. furthermore, we observed changes in
plasma catecholamines and adrenoreceptor expression that
may give further insight into sibutramine’s mechanism of
action and the contribution of net to long-term sympathetic
regulation.
previous studies showed reduction in sympathetic traffic
with systemic net inhibition by a central nervous mechanism (7, 9, 11). thus, the net response of blood pressure and
heart rate to acute net inhibition may be the sum of peripheral sympathetic stimulation and central sympathetic
inhibition. the balance between both mechanisms differs

before sibutramine treatment, supine blood pressure was
123 ⫾ 4/69 ⫾ 2 mm hg. supine heart rate was 69 ⫾ 2 bpm.
msna was 28 ⫾ 3 bursts per minute. during sibutramine
treatment, seven patients had to be excluded because blood
pressure and/or heart rate exceeded the specified margin.
with sibutramine, body weight decreased 4.1 ⫾ 0.8 kg. blood
pressure changed 5 ⫾ 3/3 ⫾ 1 mm hg (p ⬍ 0.05 for diastolic
blood pressure), and heart rate increased 8 ⫾ 2 bpm (p ⬍
0.01). the change in supine blood pressure with sibutramine
treatment was negatively correlated with msna before
treatment (fig. 1). supine plasma norepinephrine was 197 ⫾
24 pg/ml before sibutramine treatment and 332 ⫾ 27 pg/ml
after 12 wk of sibutramine treatment (p ⬍ 0.001; n ⫽ 10).
supine plasma epinephrine was 9.3 ⫾ 1.4 pg/ml before sibutramine treatment and 18.8 ⫾ 1.7 pg/ml after 12 wk of
sibutramine treatment (p ⬍ 0.001; n ⫽ 10). in nine of the 13
completers, we obtained msna recordings on the last day of
chronic sibutramine treatment (baseline, 26 ⫾ 4 bursts/min;

acute and chronic sibutramine treatment led to a similar

with acute (p ⬍ 0.05), but not with chronic sibutramine
treatment. ␤-3 adrenoreceptor expression was not affected.

consecutive study visits were excluded from the study.
we determined venous plasma catecholamine concentrations and
msna in the supine position before sibutramine treatment and again at
the end of the treatment period. before sibutramine treatment (placebo),
after 5 d of sibutramine treatment, and after 12 wk of sibutramine
treatment, we obtained abdominal sc adipose tissue samples (0.5–1.0 g)
by needle biopsy from the periumbilical region as described previously
(10). adrenoreceptor mrna expression was assessed by real-time pcr
with 18s rrna as endogenous control (“housekeeping gene”) (10).

between organs. in the heart, net inhibition results in sympathetic stimulation. in the kidney and in the vasculature,
sympathetic inhibition prevails (11, 12).
in previous studies, weight reduction of 16 kg (13) and 7
kg (14) through caloric restriction reduced msna 35.5 and
15%, respectively. in our study, a much smaller reduction in
body weight was associated with 65% reduction in msna
suggesting that the central sympatholytic action of sibutramine is sustained with chronic treatment. the mechanism is
relevant in how individual patients respond to chronic sibutramine treatment. in a patient with low sympathetic activity, sympathetic activity cannot be decreased further. the
peripheral net inhibition dominates and tends to increase
blood pressure. in contrast, in a patient with higher sympathetic activity, the central sympatholytic effect may be fully
expressed. in that patient, blood pressure may increase to a
lesser degree or even decrease.
venous norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations
were increased with chronic sibutramine treatment. in contrast, supine norepinephrine concentrations were not raised
or even decreased with acute net inhibition (6, 7, 15, 16). our
data suggest that increased plasma catecholamines with
chronic sibutramine may be explained by peripheral mech-

anisms rather than tachyphylaxis to the central sympatholytic action.
the physiological response to a change in norepinephrine
turnover is influenced by postsynaptic adrenoreceptor responsiveness. previously, net inhibition acutely increased
 xxxd2401xxx  mediated tachycardia and lipolysis (16). our
present study suggests that the phenomenon may be explained by up-regulation of postsynaptic adrenoreceptors.
up-regulation of the cardiac ␤-1 adrenoreceptor could, conceivably, contribute to the orthostatic tachycardia in patients
on net inhibitors (6, 17) or patients with genetic net deficiency (18).
the number of patients treated with selective or nonselective net inhibitors for psychiatric diseases is much
greater than the number of patients receiving sibutramine.
yet few studies addressed the effects of net inhibitors on
metabolism and cardiovascular regulation. the present and
previous studies suggest that net inhibitors elicit a central
sympatholytic effect in the brain counteracting, at least in
part, a peripheral sympathetic stimulation. furthermore,
net inhibition alters the expression of postsynaptic adrenoreceptors at least in adipose tissue. the complex interaction of central nervous and peripheral mechanisms may explain the large variability in cardiovascular and metabolic
responses to these drugs.
