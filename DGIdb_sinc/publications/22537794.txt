background: (⫾)-modafinil has piqued interest as a treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and stimulant dependence. the
r-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated.
methods: (⫾)-modafinil and its r-(⫺)- and s-(⫹)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [3h] dopamine (da) uptake and
[3h]win 35428 binding in human  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. data were
compared with cocaine and the atypical da uptake inhibitor, jhw 007. r- and s-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the
mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure.
results: (⫾)-, r-, and s-modafinil bind to the dat and inhibit da uptake less potently than cocaine, with r-modafinil having approximately
threefold higher affinity than its s-enantiomer. molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers.
r-modafinil was significantly less potent in the dat y156f mutant compared with wild-type dat, whereas s-modafinil was affected less.
studies with the y335a dat mutant showed that the r- and s-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine,
which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the dat e2c i159c. microdialysis
studies demonstrated that both r- and s-modafinil produced increases in extracellular da concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell
less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate
cocaine from saline.
conclusions: r-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. future trials with r-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the
potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.

he development of medications to treat stimulant abuse disorders remains an unmet medical need, despite decades of
research (1–3). one approach to this challenge is using “reverse translation” of clinically available medications that might
have mechanisms of action that are related to those associated with
addictive drugs, such as inhibition of dopamine (da) reuptake via
the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat). by further investigating these
agents at the molecular level and relating these observations to
behavior, a rationale for testing these agents in humans addicted to
psychostimulants might be provided. herein we compare cocaine
with the clinically available (⫾)-modafinil, its r-enantiomer ( xxxd222xxx ), and s-modafinil at the dat.

modafinil (figure 1) is used as a wake-promoting agent for the
treatment of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders (4). modafinil has
been described as a psychostimulant but is not amphetamine-like in
chemical structure, pharmacological profile, or mechanism of action.
as such, it has sparked interest for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (4,5).
modafinil has also attracted attention for the treatment of cocaine (6)
and methamphetamine dependence (7,8). in addition, the emerging
emphasis on cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction (9), has stimulated investigations into the potential
pro-cognitive effects of modafinil in this population (10 –12).
the mechanisms of action underlying the therapeutic actions of
modafinil have been debated. modafinil modulates the activity of
hypocretin, histamine, ␣-adrenergic, ␥- xxxd2177xxx , and/or
glutamate receptors (4,13). however, its ability to bind to the dat
and block da reuptake, although with low affinity compared with
cocaine, has received the most attention (14 –17). positron emission
tomography studies in human subjects have demonstrated that
modafinil binds to the dat at therapeutic doses leading to alerts
with regard to its abuse potential (18). although, preclinical data
have suggested that modafinil is like cocaine or might reinstate
cocaine taking (19 –23), the preponderance of clinical literature
indicates a low abuse liability (24 –26).
modafinil comprises r-(⫺)- and s-(⫹)-enantiomers (figure 1)
and was originally prescribed as the racemate provigil (cephalon,
frazer, pennsylvania) (27). however, more recent human studies
suggest that r-(–)-modafinil is the more metabolically stable
and longer-acting enantiomer (28 –31). we recently prepared the rand s-modafinil enantiomers, along with a series of analogues, and
showed that the r-enantiomer had approximately threefold-higher
affinity for the dat than the s-enantiomer in rat brain tissue (17).
furthermore, although the (⫾)-, r-, and s-enantiomers all stimubiol psychiatry 2012;72:405– 413

lated locomotor activity in mice, they were less effective and less
potent than cocaine. the reduced efficacy and unusual structure of
modafinil suggested that it might bind to the dat in a different
mode than cocaine. indeed, the biphenyl ring system resembles
that of the benztropine class of dat inhibitors, exemplified by jhw
007 (figure 1), which has been extensively characterized as being
“atypical” with potential for development as a medication to treat
cocaine addiction (32,33).
we previously compared the binding and da uptake inhibition
of a series of tropane-based dat inhibitors in several dat mutants
that were designed to shift the conformational equilibrium toward
either an outward- or inward-facing state (34,35). in that study we
discovered that the cocaine-like compounds (e.g., win 35428) preferred an outward-facing conformation of the dat, whereas the
benztropines (e.g., jhw 007) preferred a more occluded conformation. remarkably these data correlated with effectiveness in producing cocaine-like effects in rats (36). in subsequent studies, these
differences in binding modes were supported and further highlighted different dat binding interactions between these structurally distinct classes of dat inhibitors (37,38).
we hypothesized, on the basis of those studies, that r- and smodafinil might also bind the dat differently from cocaine, contributing to their in vivo pharmacological profiles. hence in the present
study, we compare the binding of the enantiomers and their potency
for inhibition of da uptake in human dat transfected cos-7 cells with
those of cocaine. we then tested the enantiomers in dat mutants
biased toward inward- or outward-facing conformations to investigate

the induction of specific conformations of the dat by modafinil binding. in addition da concentrations in the mouse nucleus accumbens
(nac) shell were assessed in vivo with microdialysis procedures. this
brain area has been suggested to play a significant role in mediating
the reinforcing effects of abused drugs (39 – 41). finally, we tested
modafinil and its enantiomers in a cocaine-discrimination procedure
to determine whether the enantiomers substituted for the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine as (⫾)-modafinil has been reported to
do in other species (19,22,23).

methods and materials
in vitro studies
the [3h]da uptake and [3h]win 35428 binding experiments
were carried out with standard methods on transiently transfected
cos-7 cells expressing the human dat wild-type (wt) or mutants as
described previously (35) and in detail in supplement 1. the [2(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate (mtset) labeling experiments were performed essentially as before (36) and
described in detail in supplement 1. in short, the ligands dissolved
in uptake buffer were added to the intact cells expressing either
dat e2c or dat e2c i159c in the following concentrations: (⫾)modafinil: 100 ␮mol/l, r-(⫺)-modafinil: 100 ␮mol/l, s-(⫹)modafinil: 100 ␮mol/l, da: 100 ␮mol/l, cocaine: 30 ␮mol/l, and
jhw 007: 5 ␮mol/l. the concentration of inhibitor was chosen as
the highest possible concentration that could be washed away to
allow subsequent [3h]da analysis. the mtset was added at a final

concentration of .5 mmol/l, and the cells were incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. the preincubation was stopped, and
[3h]da uptake was initiated to determine the degree of transport
inactivation by mtset.
modeling of dat/ligand complexes
the complexes between dat and modafinil enantiomers were
modeled similarly to that described previously, (38) with a wellestablished induced-fit docking protocol (42), and are described in
detail in supplement 1.
microdialysis
methods have been described in detail elsewhere (43) and provided in supplement 1. briefly, approximately 45 hours after the
surgical procedures and starting at 9:00 am microdialysis sessions
were initiated with probes connected via swivels and perfused with
ringer’s solution at a constant flow rate of 1 ␮l/min. dialysate
sampling (10 ␮l/10 min) started after approximately 30 min. mice
received cocaine, (⫾)-, s-, or r-modafinil or vehicle injections only
when stable da values were obtained. sample collection continued
for 360 min but after 2 hours occurred every 20 min. dialysate
samples were immediately injected without purification into a
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an esa
(bedford, massachusetts) 5200 coulochem detector to quantify da.
assay sensitivity for da was 2 fmoles/sample.
cocaine discrimination
experimental details are essentially identical to those described
previously (44) and provided in supplement 1. in brief, subjects
were placed in operant-conditioning chambers with overall illumination, two response levers, and pairs of green and yellow lights
above each lever. mice were trained with food reinforcement to
press both levers and eventually trained to press one after cocaine

(10 mg/kg) and the other after saline ip injections, on a doublealternation daily schedule. the ratio of responses to food pellets
was ultimately 10 (fixed-ratio 10). experimental sessions started
after a 5-min period in darkness during which responses had no
consequences. after this period lights were turned on until the
completion of the fixed-ratio requirement and the presentation of
food. sessions ended after 20 food presentations or 15 min, whichever occurred first, and were conducted 5 days/week. testing with
different doses of cocaine or modafinil was initiated after subjects
met the training criteria (supplement 1). test sessions were identical to training sessions with the exception that 10 responses on
either lever were reinforced.

results
assessment of the affinity for (ⴞ)-modafinil and its r- and senantiomers to the dat
(⫾)-modafinil and its enantiomers were tested for inhibition
of [3h]da uptake and displacement of [3h]win 35428 (figure 2).
(⫾)-modafinil inhibited [3h]da uptake with a potency that was
more than sevenfold lower than observed for da (inhibition
potency for da and (⫾)-modafinil for the dat was 1.7 and 13
␮mol/l, respectively) (figure 2a; table 1). inhibition of [3h]win
35428 binding by (⫾)-modafinil revealed lower ki values as compared with [3h]da uptake inhibition (ki ⫽ 2.3 ␮mol/l) (figure 2b
and table 1) and comparable to our previously published values
in rat brain tissue (17). interestingly, (⫾)-modafinil was less potent in inhibiting [3h]da uptake than both the r- and s- enantiomers (figure 2c and table 1). however, for the inhibition of
[3h]win 35428 binding, the observed affinity for the s-enantiomer was almost indistinguishable from the affinity for the
racemate, whereas the r-enantiomer had a higher affinity
(table 1). the discrepancy between inhibition potencies of da

transport and ki values in the binding assay could be because
[3h]da uptake inhibition is not performed under equilibrium
conditions, as the binding experiments are.
we were not able to measure any significant binding or transport inhibition of the r- and s-enantiomers to either of the homologous transporters for norepinephrine (net) or serotonin (sert),
assessed by their ability to inhibit [3h]da uptake or [3h]nisoxetine
binding at the net and [3h]5-ht at the sert (ic50 ⬎ 100 ␮mol/l for
all experiments, n ⫽ 3, data not shown). these observations are also
in accord with binding experiments performed in native rat brain
tissue (17).
the modafinil binding site in dat overlaps with the central
binding site for substrate
to characterize the modafinil binding site in the dat, we carried
out a docking study of the two enantiomers with dat models
described previously (37,38) on the basis of the crystal structure of
the bacterial homologue leut (figures 3a, b). the modafinil enantiomers were docked in the primary binding pocket (s1) in the
center of the protein that is also the binding site for da and cocaine
(37) as well as for the atypical dat inhibitor jhw 007 and its analogues (38). the top-ranked binding poses revealed a significant
similarity between the binding modes of the enantiomers, however, with unique interactions. one distinctive structural feature of
modafinil, compared with either cocaine or jhw 007, is that it lacks
a charged pyramidal nitrogen. thus, although the orientations of
the biphenyl ring systems in the binding modes of both modafinil
enantiomers might be similar to those of the benztropine derivatives (38), there is no direct interaction with asp79. in contrast, the
terminal amide moiety of modafinil tends to stack with the phenyl

c.j. loland et al.
ring of phe76 and h-bond to the backbone of ser321. these restraints result in different positioning of the chiral s ⫽ o in the rand s-enantiomers. although both enantiomers are in close vicinity
to tyr156, the s ⫽ o of r-modafinil interacts with the -oh group of
the tyr156 residue, whereas this interaction does not occur with
s-modafinil.
thus, we sought to experimentally validate the docking results
and hypothesized that the removal of the oh-group of tyr156 by
changing it to a phenylalanine (y156f) could disrupt the interaction
with r-modafinil but have little effect on the s-modafinil binding
interaction. indeed r-modafinil showed a marked decrease in affinity for the dat y156f mutant as compared with dat wt protein
(figure 3c) with a 14-fold change (table 1, compare wt and y156f
dat binding), whereas only a twofold difference in affinity was
observed for s-modafinil by the y156f mutation (figure 3d; table
1). these data are in agreement with the docking models and suggest that only r-modafinil interacts with tyr156 in the primary
binding pocket.

r- and s-modafinil preferentially bind to a different dat
conformation than cocaine
to identify the preferred dat conformational state induced
by r- and s-modafinil, two previously established methods (36)
that assess the conformational state of the dat upon binding of
different ligands were employed: 1) the shift in ic50 for [3h]da
uptake inhibition by the modafinil enantiomers between the wt
and a tyr335 to alanine mutation, and 2) the accessibility of a
cysteine inserted in  xxxg2318xxx  to the cysteine-reactive compound
mtset. we have previously shown that tyr335 is critical for

presentation with the carbon colored in cyan. (c) removal of the hydroxyl group on tyr156 in dat (y156f. open symbols) results in a ⬎14-fold decrease in ic50

rendering it insensitive to mtset [36], data not shown). data are shown as

performed in triplicate.

regulating conformational isomerization in the transport cycle
(34,35,45) and that mutation of this residue (y335a) shifts the
conformational equilibrium toward an inward-facing conformation. this suggestion has recently been supported by the crystallization of the inward-facing conformation of leut with the
cognate mutation (46). thus, the y335a mutation can be used as
a tool to probe whether a drug favors an inward-facing or outward-facing conformation (36). to assess this for the modafinil
enantiomers, we investigated their [3h]da uptake inhibition potency in the dat y335a mutant and compared it with wt (figure 4a). as previously determined, dat inhibitors such as cocaine bind preferentially to the outward-facing conformation of
the dat. this results in a large decrease in potency for [3h]da
uptake inhibition between dat wt and the y335a mutant as
determined in figure 4a for cocaine, resulting in an almost 200-

biol psychiatry 2012;72:405– 413 409
fold change in ic50. on the contrary, the nonstimulant atypical
dat inhibitor jhw 007 shows only a minor, approximately 20fold, change in ic50, suggesting that it binds to a conformation
that differs from that preferred by cocaine (figure 4a). performing the same experiments on the r- and s-modafinil enantiomers gave y335a/wt ic50 ratios (10.6 and 14.8, respectively) that
approximate that for jhw 007 (figure 4a). this suggests that
these da uptake inhibitors bind to a dat conformation distinct
from the cocaine-induced conformation and closer to the one
observed for jhw 007.
the second assay is based on the reactivity of a cysteine
inserted into position 159 in  xxxg2318xxx  of the dat located in the
vicinity of the ligand binding site on the extracellular side. previous observations in dat (35,36,47,48), net, and sert (49) have
suggested that the accessibility of this position is dependent on
the conformational state of the transporter: it is accessible to the
extracellular environment when the dat is in the outward-facing conformation and inaccessible in the closed or inward-facing
conformation. importantly, reaction of an inserted cysteine in
this position (i159c) with mtset results in inactivation of the
dat, allowing the use of da uptake as a functional read-out
for i159c reactivity (36). the i159c mutant was generated in a
mtset insensitive dat background (e2c) in which the two external endogenous cysteines were mutated to alanines (c90ac306a). incubation of .5 mmol/l mtset for 10 min in buffer
resulted in an inactivation to approximately 60% of the initial
[3h]da transport capacity. the addition of cocaine (30 ␮mol/l)
together with mtset resulted in a marked increase in inactivation to approximately only 20% remaining transport capacity,
whereas da (100 ␮mol/l) and, in agreement with previous results (36), jhw 007 (5 ␮mol/l) caused a protection from the
mtset reactivity (figure 4b). the addition of the r- or s-modafinil
enantiomers (100 ␮mol/l) caused a similar protection of cys159
from mtset reactivity as observed for jhw 007 (98 ⫾ 9% and
83 ⫾ 9% for r- and s-modafinil, respectively, compared with
102 ⫾ 5% for jhw 007, n ⫽ 4 – 8) (figure 4b). this further suggests that both modafinil enantiomers induce a conformation of
the dat in which the extracellular vestibule is closed, thus protecting cys159 from reacting with the added mtset.
microdialysis studies with cocaine, (ⴞ)-, r-, and s-modafinil
to investigate the comparative pharmacology of modafinil and
cocaine, we measured extracellular da concentrations in the
mouse nac shell (see figure 5 for statistical analyses). r-modafinil
(30, 100, 300 mg/kg ip) significantly stimulated da levels to approximately 300% of da basal levels at 40 – 60 min after injection. these
levels were maintained throughout the 6 hours of measurement
(figure 5a). similar effects were obtained with s-modafinil (figure
5b). as in previous reports (43,50), cocaine (10 –55 mg/kg) significantly stimulated the extracellular levels of da, with rapid onsets
and offsets of action. the da reached a maximum of approximately
700% of basal levels at approximately 30 min after cocaine injection
(figure 5c). the maximal increases in da levels were strongly related to the dose of cocaine, whereas the slopes of the dose-effect
curves for modafinil and its enantiomers were much more shallow
(figure 5d), indicating a limited dose-dependency in effects of
modafinil and a lower level of maximal stimulation of da, compared
with cocaine (43).
cocaine drug discrimination
cocaine produced a dose-related increase in the percentage of
drug-appropriate responses in mice trained to discriminate cocaine
(10 mg/kg) from saline injections (figure 6, filled symbols). (⫾)www.sobp.org/journal

modafinil and both enantiomers fully substituted for cocaine, although with approximately one-tenth the potency of cocaine on a
molar basis (table 2). there were no significant differences in potency between the enantiomers of modafinil, similar to the observations in the microdialysis studies.

discussion
(⫾)-modafinil and its r- and s-enantiomers bind with relatively
low affinity to the human dat and inhibit da uptake in cos7 cells,
with the r- slightly more potent than the s-enantiomer. as reported
previously in rat brain tissue (17), neither enantiomer showed measurable binding to sert or net.
both the r- and s-enantiomers docked at a common dat binding pocket significantly overlapping with the s1 binding site for da
and cocaine (37) as well as for the atypical dat inhibitors (e.g., jhw
007) (38). although a significant overlap in binding of the modafinil
enantiomers was apparent, a unique residue tyr156 that coordinated differently with the r- and s-enantiomers was identified (figure 3a, b). to verify these models, we investigated the interaction of
the enantiomers with tyr156, through a single point mutation.
according to the model, both enantiomers interact with tyr156,
but only the r-enantiomer interacts with the tyr-oh group. thus,
we hypothesized that removal of the oh-group with mutation of
tyr156 to a phenylalanine would disrupt r-modafinil but have little
effect on s-modafinil binding. indeed, r-modafinil showed a 14fold decrease in affinity for the dat y156f mutant, as compared
with dat wt protein (figure 3c; table 1), whereas only a minor
difference in affinities was obtained with s-modafinil. moreover,
the removal of the oh-group disrupts a hydrogen bond to asp79 in
www.sobp.org/journal

transmembrane helix 1, which presumably alters the orientation of
the residue and therefore only slightly affects coordination to the
s-modafinil.
we have previously provided evidence that dat tyr335 is critical
for regulating conformational isomerization in the transport cycle
(34,35,45). tyr335 is located in the third intracellular loop and is
100% conserved throughout the family of neurotransmitter/sodium symporter proteins (51). mutation of this residue changes the
conformational equilibrium of the dat, resulting in a transporter
residing preferentially in an inward-facing conformation (52). the
crystal structure of leut, a bacterial homolog of dat, supports the
suggestion of tyr335 as part of an intracellular gate (46,53). our
experiments revealed that the r- and s-modafinil enantiomers gave
y335a/wt ic50 ratios that were similar to those for jhw 007 and in
contrast to cocaine. this suggests that these dat inhibitors bind
differently from the cocaine-induced conformation and closer to
the one observed for jhw 007.
previous observations of dat (36), net, and sert (49) have
suggested that cys159 is accessible to the extracellular environment when the transporter is in an outward-facing conformation
but becomes less accessible when the extracellular gate closes
and the dat isomerizes toward an inward-facing conformation.
importantly, reaction of cys159 with the sulfhydryl reactive mtset results in inactivation of the transporter, allowing the use of
da uptake as a functional read-out for i159c reactivity (36). in
this experiment, both r- and s-modafinil protected cys159 from
reacting with mtset, further supporting their binding mode as
preferring a more extracellular occluded conformation of the
dat, unlike cocaine (figure 4b). these findings are consistent

cocaine was administered 5 min before and the modafinil enantiomers
were administered 60 min before testing. ordinates for the top panel indicate percentage of responses on the cocaine-appropriate key, and ordinates
for the bottom panel indicate the rates at which responses were emitted (as
a percentage of response rates after saline administration). abscissae: drug
dose in milligrams/kilogram (log scale). each point represents average effects of six mice, with the exception of the highest dose of r-modafinil,
which was examined in only five subjects. note the dose-effect curve for
r-modafinil has been “nudged” to the left to ensure that it can be discerned
in the graphic presentation of the data.

with the recently reported study of w84l and d313n dat mutants wherein (⫾)-modafinil displayed wt/mutant ratios different from cocaine and more like those of the dat inhibitors
benztropine, gbr 12909, and bupropion (54).
although these in vitro experiments suggested that the
modafinil enantiomers might be more like atypical dat inhibitors,
several reports of (⫾)-modafinil in models of psychostimulant
abuse suggest a cocaine-like pharmacological profile (4 – 6). cocaine, modafinil, and its enantiomers stimulated da levels in the
nac shell—a finding consistent with the literature—suggesting
that these drugs might produce reinforcing effects like those produced by other abused drugs (39 – 41). however, cocaine administration showed a time- and dose-related stimulation of da levels
that differed from that produced by modafinil and its enantiomers.
because a temporal contingency between drug-injection and drugeffects is an important feature of the reinforcing effects of drugs,

this predicts that modafinil and its enantiomers will have lower
liability for abuse in humans. moreover, the highest doses of
modafinil and its enantiomers reached similarly lower maximal effects on da levels than those with cocaine, suggesting that, although they block da reuptake, they do so differently than cocaine.
also, at variance with cocaine, the da elevations produced by
modafinil and its enantiomers were obtained at doses 10 –15 times
higher than effective cocaine doses. taken together, these data
suggest a low abuse liability for (⫾)-modafinil and its enantiomers
in humans.
finally, although (⫾)-modafinil has been evaluated in several
species, including humans, the cocaine-like discriminative-stimulus
effects of the enantiomers have not previously been described. we
found that both the r- and s-enantiomers of modafinil fully substituted for cocaine in mice, at a pretreatment time of 60 min, and
were approximately 8- to 11-fold less potent than cocaine. in addition, as with the microdialysates, no enantioselectivity was observed.
there might be several explanations for the differences we
observe in the computational/in vitro studies and behavior in
mice, as compared with the benztropine-like dat inhibitors.
first, the modafinil enantiomers bind with relatively low affinity
to the dat, and their binding affinities at net and sert were too
low to quantify, although net binding has been reported previously (15). although the modafinil enantiomers share the diphenyl moiety of the benztropines, previously reported structureactivity relationships suggest that the modafinil analogues
might bind somewhat differently at the dat (55). furthermore,
the modeling studies described herein clearly show that
r-modafinil interacts with the tyr156 –oh, and this interaction
likely causes this molecule to prefer a more occluded conformation of the dat, as opposed to cocaine, wherein the 2-carbomethoxy group prevents an h-bond from forming between asp79
and tyr 156 and thus keeps this “gate” open (37). finally, the
modafinil enantiomers are non xxxd2850xxx  dat inhibitors (56,57) in
that they have no basic nitrogen to interact with the asp79, like
most dat inhibitors. thus, modafinil and its enantiomers might
not be “atypical”— defined as having high affinity for the dat
with a preference for a more occluded conformation and devoid
of significant cocaine-like behaviors (32). however, they are certainly different from cocaine in both binding mode and pharmacological effects and show strong preference for a dat conformation different from cocaine and more similar to the
benztropines.
the present data are comparable to reported discriminative
stimulus effects of (⫾)-modafinil in rats (22) and primates (23). with

minister cocaine. in contrast, deroche-gamonet et al. (58) failed to
find reinforcing effects of (⫾)-modafinil in rats without a history of
cocaine self-administration. interestingly, one study found chronic
administration of (⫾)-modafinil to decrease cocaine self-administration (23), supporting its use as a potential substitute therapy in
human cocaine abusers.
(⫾)-modafinil and its r-enantiomer ( xxxd222xxx ) are clinically
available, and the racemate is currently being evaluated for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, cocaine, and
methamphetamine addiction (59). despite clinical availability,
there are no reports of their abuse, and the literature for the racemate predicts a low abuse liability (24,25,60). importantly, (⫾)modafinil did not serve as a reinforcer in cocaine abusers, making it
an attractive candidate for treatment of this population (61). rmodafinil does not seem to be significantly different from the racemate in preclinical studies, but reports indicate an improved pharmacokinetic profile and duration of action in humans (28,31,62,63).
thus, we suggest that r-modafinil might be a promising candidate
for a well-designed and compliance controlled clinical trial (8,64) for
cocaine or methamphetamine addiction. the therapeutic dose for
r-modafinil is typically 50 –250 mg orally/day (31), which is lower
than (⫾)-modafinil (200 – 600 mg orally/day), and might translate
into an improved side-effect profile. furthermore, the recently reported cognitive-enhancing actions of (⫾)-modafinil, especially in
methamphetamine abusers (12), suggest that additional benefit of
r-modafinil might be realized in this patient population.
