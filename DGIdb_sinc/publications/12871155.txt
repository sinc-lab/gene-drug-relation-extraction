recent developments in the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.  the acetylcholinesterase (ache) and  xxxg248xxx  (buche) inhibitory activities of a series of pyrano[2,3-b]quinolines (2, 3), [1,8]naphthyridines (5, 6), 4-amino-2,3-diaryl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinolines (11-13)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5h-cyclohepta[e]furo[2,3-b]pyridine (14), 4-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenylthieno[2,3-b]quinoline (15)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5h-cyclohepta[e]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (16) are described. these compounds are tacrine analogues that have been prepared from readily available polyfunctionalized ethyl [6-amino-5-cyano-4h-pyran]-3-carboxylates (9, 10), ethyl [6-amino-5-cyanopyridine]-3-carboxylates (7, 8), 2-amino-3-cyano-4,5-diarylfurans (17-19) and 2-amino-3-cyano-4,5-diphenylthiophene (20) via friedl√§nder condensation with selected ketones. these compounds are competitive and, in a few cases, non-competitive inhibitors for ache, the most potent being compound (14), though three-fold less active than tacrine. the buche inhibitory activity is only significant in compounds 11 and 14, ten-fold less active than tacrine. furthermore, the products 12 and 13 are selective and moderate ache inhibitors.
