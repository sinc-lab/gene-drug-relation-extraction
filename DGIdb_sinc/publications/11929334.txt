summary
abstract

 xxxd348xxx , a synthetic analogue of hirudin, is a specific and reversible inhibitor
of thrombin which binds directly with both fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin.
in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty (ptca), results from a large well designed study and its reanalysis
(n = 4312) indicate that  xxxd348xxx  is more effective than heparin in the prevention of ischaemic complications for up to 90 days after the start of treatment. in
addition, among patients undergoing ptca for post myocardial infarction (mi)
 xxxd348xxx  may be more effective than heparin in preventing ischaemic complications for up to 180 days after treatment was started. data from dose-finding
studies indicate  xxxd348xxx  has potential in the treatment of patients with unstable
angina not undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci); however, well
designed comparative studies are needed before firm conclusions can be made.
among patients with acute st elevation mi, randomised trials have demonstrated  xxxd348xxx  to be significantly more effective than heparin in improving
early patency in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. data
from the hirulog and early reperfusion/occlusion (hero)-1 trial (n = 412)
indicate that  xxxd348xxx  recipients were significantly more likely to have thrombin inhibition in myocardial ischaemia (timi) grade 3 flow at 90 to 120 minutes
than heparin recipients. in addition, data from the hero-2 trial (n = 17 073) show
 xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective than heparin in reducing adjudicated
96-hour reinfarction and 30-day investigator-reported death/reinfarction than
heparin.  xxxd348xxx  was as effective as heparin in reducing 30-day mortality.
data from a meta-analysis of four randomised trials among patients undergoing ptca or treatment for acute coronary syndromes indicate that, at after 30 to
50 days of follow-up,  xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective than heparin
in reducing the incidence of nonfatal mi and the combined endpoint of death or
nonfatal mi.
the most significant adverse events associated with  xxxd348xxx  are bleeding
complications. in individual trials,  xxxd348xxx  was as well tolerated as heparin
with, in general, a reduced incidence of bleeding complications. additionally,
 xxxd348xxx  provides a more consistent, predictable anticoagulant response. in
4312 patients with unstable angina undergoing ptca the incidence of retroperitoneal bleeding, blood transfusion and major haemorrhage was significantly
lower in  xxxd348xxx  than heparin recipients. data from the hero-2 trial in patients with acute mi indicate that although  xxxd348xxx  recipients had a signifi-

cantly higher incidence of mild or moderate bleeding than heparin recipients,
there was no difference in intracranial haemorrhage, severe bleeding or transfusions. data from a meta-analysis among 5674 patients with ischaemic heart disease show  xxxd348xxx  recipients were at a significantly lower risk of haemorrhagic
events than heparin recipients.
conclusions:  xxxd348xxx  is an effective alternative to heparin in the prevention of ischaemic complications in patients with unstable angina undergoing
ptca. in addition, the drug has shown potential in the treatment of patients with
unstable angina not undergoing pci. for patients with mi, it is clear that
 xxxd348xxx  can replace heparin in the management of mi where streptokinase is
used as the thrombolytic agent. further data are required on the efficacy of
 xxxd348xxx  in patients undergoing thrombolysis with newer thrombolytics.
pharmacodynamic
profile

 xxxd348xxx  is a specific and reversible inhibitor of thrombin and, unlike heparin,
inhibits both fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin and does not require antithrombin as a cofactor. the resultant complex is reversible, as  xxxd348xxx  is
slowly cleaved by thrombin to leave a weak thrombin inhibitor binding competitively to the fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) recognition exosite of thrombin.
in animal and in vitro studies  xxxd348xxx  has been shown to have dose- or
concentration-dependent antithrombin properties with activity against clotbound thrombin. in addition, in vitro  xxxd348xxx  weakly inhibits activated protein
c, improves vessel patency, and inhibits thrombin-induced plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 and  xxxg741xxx . in animal models,  xxxd348xxx  reduces thrombotic vascular stenosis, the time to thrombolysis, and platelet deposition.
in healthy volunteers, intravenous (iv)  xxxd348xxx  produces a dose-dependent
increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), prothrombin time and
thrombin time. in patients with acute coronary syndromes, a roughly linear correlation is observed between dose and aptt values. there is little intraindividual
and interindividual variation in aptt values with 99.1% of patients maintaining
values within a 40-second range in one study. peak prolongation of values occurred 2 hours after the start of the infusion in one study. activated clotting times
(acts) also show a dose-dependent effect.
 xxxd348xxx  is as effective as heparin in reducing plasma levels of  xxxg784xxx . in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation,  xxxd348xxx  produces an
exponential dose-dependent decrease in  xxxg784xxx  levels with the most
consistent decreases seen at dosages of 1 mg/kg/h. in addition, when combined
with  xxxd53xxx  there is some evidence to suggest it may be more effective than
heparin plus  xxxd53xxx  in preventing platelet activation.
mean aptt values are higher in patients with severe renal impairment and in
those requiring haemodialysis than in patients with normal to moderate impairment. in addition, mean acts are prolonged in patients with moderate or severe
renal function compared with those with mild impairment or normal renal function.

pharmacokinetic profile

in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca)
and in healthy male adult volunteers, iv  xxxd348xxx  exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) are dose-proportional and are
reached after 2 minutes in those receiving iv bolus injections.  xxxd348xxx  has a
small mean volume of distribution (0.156 l/kg) and does not bind to plasma
proteins,  xxxg1726xxx  or red blood cells.
 xxxd348xxx  is rapidly cleared from plasma by a combination of renal mecha-

nisms and proteolytic cleavage. renal clearance is the primary route for elimination of unchanged  xxxd348xxx  which accounts for 20% of total clearance. about
80% of  xxxd348xxx  is degraded by proteolytic cleavage, including cleavage by
thrombin with its protease, to individual amino acids and small, largely inactive
peptide fragments.  xxxd348xxx  has an elimination half-life (t1⁄2) of 25 minutes and
a total body clearance rate of 0.204 l/kg/h following iv infusion in individuals
with normal renal function undergoing pci. renal clearance is the primary route
for clearance of unchanged drug and  xxxd348xxx  clearance is 1.8-fold greater than
the glomerular filtration rate suggesting that renal secretion occurs in addition to
filtration.
in individuals with moderate renal impairment, clearance of  xxxd348xxx  is
reduced both in otherwise healthy volunteers and in patients with unstable angina
undergoing ptca. cmax and t1⁄2 increase progressively and total body clearance
decreases as the degree of renal impairment increases in severity. dosage adjustments are therefore recommended in patients with a glomerular filtration rate of
<3.6 l/h.
in patients undergoing ptca, coadministration of  xxxd348xxx  with unfractionated heparin, warfarin or thrombolytics was associated with an increased
risk of bleeding compared with that in patients not receiving these concomitant
medications. coadministration of  xxxd348xxx  with  xxxd53xxx , ticlopidine or low
molecular weight heparin has not revealed any clinically significant interactions.
therapeutic use

percutaneous coronary interventions (pci).  xxxd348xxx  is as effective as heparin in improving angiographic and procedural outcomes according to data from
a randomised, double-blind study. data from a prospectively randomised population indicate that in patients with documented evidence of an mi  xxxd348xxx 
may be more effective than heparin in preventing ischaemic outcomes. in addition, according to a reanalysis,  xxxd348xxx  is more effective than heparin in preventing ischaemic complications in patients with unstable angina undergoing
ptca. in the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study (n = 4312), 11.4% of  xxxd348xxx 
recipients reached the primary endpoint (death in-hospital, mi, abrupt vessel
closure or rapid clinical deterioration of cardiac origin) compared with 12.2% of
heparin recipients; in a prospective subgroup analysis of 741 study participants
with a documented mi, significantly fewer  xxxd348xxx  than heparin recipients
experienced procedural failure (5.1 vs 10.8%). a recent reanalysis of this study
demonstrated that  xxxd348xxx  recipients had significantly less ischaemic complications (death/mi/urgent revascularisation) than heparin recipients for up to 90
days after the start of treatment. in addition, among patients with postinfarction
angina  xxxd348xxx  produced significant improvements in the incidence of ischaemic complications for up to 180 days after the procedure compared with heparin.
evidence from further subgroup analyses indicates  xxxd348xxx  may be more
effective than heparin in preventing ischaemic rebound following abrupt discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, and that switching to  xxxd348xxx  treatment
within 1 hour of starting heparin therapy may lead to a reduction in the incidence
of major clinical events. among 2796 patients significantly fewer  xxxd348xxx 
recipients experienced ischaemic rebound than heparin recipients (11 vs 30; p =
0.001), and in 1006 patients undergoing ptca within 1 hour of heparin therapy,
the incidence of death, mi or revascularisation was lower in  xxxd348xxx  recipients
than in those who remained on heparin.

 xxxd348xxx : a review

preliminary evidence from a small nonblind study indicates  xxxd348xxx  may
have a role to play in the management of ischaemic complications following stent
placement. interim data from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
undergoing pci appear promising.
unstable angina without pci. in two dose-finding studies  xxxd348xxx  demonstrated potential in the treatment of unstable angina. in a well designed trial
among 410 patients [thrombin inhibition in myocardial ischaemia (timi) 7],
individuals receiving  xxxd348xxx  0.25 to 1 mg/kg/h iv for 72 hours were significantly less likely to suffer a secondary endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial
infarction (mi) than those who received an ineffective dose of  xxxd348xxx  0.02
mg/kg/h iv for 72 hours at both hospital discharge (3.2 vs 10%) and 6 weeks (5.2
vs 12.5%) after the start of the infusion. at both timepoints there was no difference
in the incidence of unsatisfactory outcome (primary endpoint) between any of
the four dosage groups. larger well designed studies are required to confirm the
efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in the treatment of unstable angina without pci.
myocardial infarction. taken together, results of four randomised trials
showed that  xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective than heparin in improving early patency and reducing the risk of adjudicated 96-hour and in-hospital
reinfarction, and was as effective as heparin in reducing 30-day mortality in
patients with mi. data from the hirulog and early reperfusion/occlusion
(hero)-1 double-blind trial among 412 patients indicate  xxxd348xxx  recipients
were significantly more likely to have timi grade 3 flow at 90 to 120 minutes
than heparin recipients (47 vs 35%; p = 0.02). data from the hero-2 nonblind
trial (n = 17 073) show  xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective than heparin
in reducing adjudicated 96-hour (1.6 vs 2.3%; p = 0.001) reinfarction and
investigator-reported 30-day death/reinfarction (12.9 vs 14.2%; p = 0.023).  xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients had similar incidences of adjusted 30-day mortality.
a meta-analysis of four randomised trials among patients with unstable angina
or mi (n = 4973) indicated that, after 30 to 50 days of follow-up,  xxxd348xxx  was
significantly more effective than heparin in reducing the incidence of nonfatal
mi and the combined endpoint of death or nonfatal mi.
tolerability

the most significant clinical risks associated with  xxxd348xxx  are bleeding complications.
data from the two largest trials to date indicated that  xxxd348xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of bleeding than heparin in patients undergoing ptca
for unstable or postinfarction angina, and a higher incidence of mild or moderate
bleeding than heparin among patients with mi. in 4312 patients undergoing
ptca, the incidence of retroperitoneal bleeding, blood transfusion and major
haemorrhage was significantly lower in  xxxd348xxx  than heparin recipients. the
median act value was significantly lower in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients (346 vs 383 seconds). in 17 073 patients with mi,  xxxd348xxx  recipients had
a significantly higher incidence of mild or moderate bleeding than heparin recipients. the incidence of stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or severe bleeding was
slightly higher in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients; however, statistical significance was not reached in any of the three events. there was no significant
difference among  xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients in the incidence of bleeding
requiring blood transfusion. values for aptt were significantly higher in
 xxxd348xxx  than heparin recipients, which may have accounted for the excess
mild to moderate bleeding.

a meta-analysis, that included 5674 patients undergoing treatment for acute
coronary syndromes, reported  xxxd348xxx  recipients were at a significantly lower
risk of haemorrhagic events than heparin recipients.
data reported by the manufacturer indicate the incidence of treatment-related
adverse events is similar between heparin and  xxxd348xxx  recipients. the most
frequent treatment-emergent events in  xxxd348xxx  recipients were back pain,
pain, nausea, headache and hypotension.
dosage and
administration

 xxxd348xxx  is indicated as an anticoagulant in patients with unstable angina undergoing ptca. it is intended for use only in patients taking concomitant aspirin
( xxxd234xxx ) 300 to 325 mg/day.
the recommended dosage for adults is an iv bolus of 1 mg/kg followed by a
4-hour iv infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h. a further infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h may be given
for an additional 20 hours at the discretion of the prescribing physician. current
clinical trials are evaluating a lower dosage of 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by an
infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure.  xxxd348xxx  should
not be administered by intramuscular injection.
dosage adjustments are not required in the elderly per se; however, adjustments are required in moderate or severe renal impairment and for this reason the
anticoagulant status of elderly patients receiving the drug should be monitored.
it is not known whether  xxxd348xxx  crosses the placenta or whether it is excreted
in the breast milk.  xxxd348xxx  is contraindicated in patients with active major
bleeding, or a hypersensitivity to  xxxd348xxx  or its components.
there is no known antidote to  xxxd348xxx  and no experience of overdose in
clinical trials. in the case of overdose,  xxxd348xxx  should be discontinued and the
patient closely monitored for signs of bleeding.

1. introduction
 xxxd348xxx  is a synthetic 20 amino acid polypeptide based on the structure of hirudin, a naturally occurring anticoagulant comprised of a 65
amino acid polypeptide produced by the salivary
glands of the european leech (hirudo medicinalis).[1]  xxxd348xxx  combines a fragment of the cterminus of hirudin with an n-terminus fragment
( xxxd1793xxx -pro-arg-pro-[gly]4) separated by a polymeric linker of glycyl residues.[2]  xxxd348xxx  and
hirudin are specific inhibitors of thrombin and, unlike heparin, do not require endogenous cofactors
for their anticoagulant activity.[3]
this review focuses on the potential place of
intravenous (iv)  xxxd348xxx  in the prevention of
thrombotic disorders: either in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary interventions (pcis); as a
treatment for unstable angina in patients not undergoing pci; or as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy
in myocardial infarction (mi). in a phase ii study,

the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  has also been studied
among patients with venous thrombosis after major hip or knee surgery;[4] however, subsequent
studies have not been published and this indication
is not discussed further in this review.
2. pharmacodynamic profile
2.1 mechanism of action

thrombin plays a major role in the regulation
of blood coagulation and its inhibition is key to
achieving an antithrombotic and anticoagulant
state.[5,6] thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin by
cleaving off  xxxg784xxx  and b, and binds to
fibrin through interactions with its fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )
recognition exosite.[5] in addition, it activates factor xiii which promotes clot stability,[7] and
through a feedback mechanism encourages its own
production by activating factors v and viii.[7] further, thrombin encourages platelet activation through
drugs 2002; 62 (5)

 xxxd348xxx : a review

thrombin-mediated signalling via protease activated receptors, which in addition to platelet aggregation provides surfaces for  xxxg741xxx 
complex assembly.[8,9]
 xxxd348xxx  is a specific and reversible inhibitor
of thrombin;[10] it binds to thrombin in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex.[3] in contrast to heparin,
 xxxd348xxx  inhibits both fibrin-bound and free
thrombin and does not require antithrombin as a
cofactor.[11] its  xxxd1793xxx -phe-arg-pro fragment binds
to the active catalytic site of thrombin and the cterminal region binds to the substrate binding fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) recognition exosite of thrombin (inhibition constant 1.9 nmol/l).[12] animal studies
have shown that inhibition of both sites increases
antithrombotic potency substantially compared
with inhibition of either site alone.[13] the resultant
complex is reversible, as  xxxd348xxx  is slowly
cleaved by thrombin (at the arg-pro bond) at a catalytic rate of 0.01sec-1.[12] this frees the active site
and leaves the remaining molecule (a weak thrombin inhibitor) binding competitively to the fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) recognition exosite of thrombin; blockade of the exosite prevents fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) binding.[8]
this reversible interaction means  xxxd348xxx  has
less potential to cause bleeding complications than
hirudin (see section 5).[14]
2.2 animal and in vitro studies

numerous animal and in vitro studies have investigated the pharmacodynamic properties of
 xxxd348xxx  and these are summarised in table i.
in animal and in vitro studies,  xxxd348xxx  has been
shown to have dose- or concentration-dependent
antithrombin properties with activity against clotbound thrombin. in addition, in vitro  xxxd348xxx 
weakly inhibits  xxxg1847xxx , improves
vessel patency, and indirectly inhibits thrombininduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and  xxxg741xxx .  xxxd348xxx  has demonstrated complete inhibition of thrombin-mediated platelet activation
and aggregation activities in vitro. in animal models,  xxxd348xxx  reduces thrombotic vascular stenosis, the time to thrombolysis, and platelet deposition.

in healthy volunteers,  xxxd348xxx  produces a
dose-dependent increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), prothrombin time (pt) and
thrombin time. in a randomised, placebo-controlled
trial involving 54 volunteers, a significant correlation between the dose of iv  xxxd348xxx  (0.05 to 0.6
mg/kg over 15 minutes) and the mean peak effect
on aptt (163 to 283% of baseline) was observed
(r = 0.86; p < 0.001).[28] the pt (expressed as international normalisation ratio) ranged from 1.25
± 0.06 to 2.43 ± 0.3 and the thrombin time was
prolonged to >400% of baseline at the lowest dose
of  xxxd348xxx . in 10 volunteers given an extended
infusion of iv  xxxd348xxx  (0.3 mg/kg/h for 12 or
24 hours) a constant prolongation of aptt (210 to
250% of baseline) was observed, and in 6 volunteers given an iv bolus of  xxxd348xxx  0.3 mg/kg
the mean peak aptt was 333% of baseline. like
iv administration, subcutaneous (sc) administration (0.3 to 1 mg/kg) also produced dose-dependent
prolongation of the mean peak aptt (150 to 176%
of baseline) and pt (1.18 ± 0.05 to 1.48 ± 0.17);
however, unlike iv administration where the effect
of  xxxd348xxx  on aptt levels was rapidly reversed
at the end of the infusion, the anticoagulant effect
of  xxxd348xxx  after sc administration (0.3 to 1
mg/kg) was sustained for several hours.[28]
2.3.2 in patients with acute coronary syndromes

clinical trials, discussed in detail in section 4,
indicate that in patients with acute coronary syndromes the effect of  xxxd348xxx  on aptt is similar
to that seen in healthy volunteers. values of aptt
are dose-related,[10,29-34] displaying a roughly linear correlation (r = 0.95)[31] and, unlike heparin,
values are stable over time,[29,32] showing little
intraindividual and predictable interindividual
variation.[31] in a dose-ranging study that included
410 patients with unstable angina, aptt was prolonged by 39, 132, 150 and 213% compared with
baseline for the dose groups 0.02, 0.25, 0.5 and 1
mg/kg/h, respectively,[29] with 92.9 and 99.1% of
patients maintaining aptt values within a 30- and

in vitro
in human plasma, exhibits a concentration-dependent anticoagulant effect with similar potency to  xxxd218xxx  and efegatran but lower
potency than hirudin. inhibits generation of thrombin and  xxxg741xxx [15]
dose-dependently inhibits thrombin-induced pai-1 generation in baboon cultured aortic smooth muscle cells[16,17]
inhibits both the coagulative and cellular effects of thrombin in human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells[18]
unlike  xxxd218xxx  and hirudin, produces weak inhibition of protein calcium at high concentrations[19]
completely inhibits thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation at ≈1/500th of the plasma concentration achieved during percutaneous
coronary intervention[20]
in animals
as effective as enoxaparin and heparin in improving vessel patency and reducing thrombus mass in canine stenosed coronary artery[21]
in rat balloon-injured carotid arteries, iv  xxxd348xxx  (1 mg/kg/h for 4h × 6 doses) reduces vascular stenosis and associated excess levels
of pdgf[22]
as effective as hirudin and ppack and significantly more effective than heparin (p < 0.01) in reducing the number of reocclusions in a rat
model of  xxxg1766xxx -induced thrombolysis. in addition, is as effective as ppack in reducing the time to thrombolysis[23]
in a rat carotid endarterectomy model, plasma levels are increased dose dependently. in addition, reduces platelet deposition and
increases aptt values dose dependently[24,25]
in a rat jugular vein clamping model, its dose-dependent antithrombotic action is more potent than that of heparin and  xxxd218xxx  and
similar to that of hirudin[26]
in juvenile farm pigs, local administration does not prevent thrombus formation or reduce neointimal thickening after carotid stent
implantation [27]
aptt = activated partial thromboplastin time; iv = intravenous; pai-1 = plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; pdgf = platelet derived growth

40-second range, respectively. in patients with mi,
treatment with  xxxd348xxx  (0.1 to 1 mg/kg/h for up
to 6 days) significantly prolonged aptt values in
a dose-dependent fashion (≤150 seconds).[32-34]
values of aptt in  xxxd348xxx  recipients peaked
2 hours after the start of the infusion and fell to
control values 4 hours after the end of the infusion
in one study.[35] in another trial, the half-life of the
effect on aptt was reported as 40 minutes.[10]
activated clotting times (act) show a consistent dose-dependent effect in  xxxd348xxx  recipients.[10,30] in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation, act values correlated with plasma
 xxxd348xxx  concentrations (r = 0.82).[10] the relationship between act values and abrupt vessel
closure in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) is discussed
in detail in section 4.1.1.

either iv  xxxd348xxx  0.5 mg/kg bolus followed by
0.2 mg/kg/h, or 0.15 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.6
mg/kg/h, or iv heparin 5000 units as a bolus. fifteen minutes after the start of drug treatment, reductions in median plasma levels of fibrinopeptide
a (compared with baseline) were observed in both
low- and high-dose  xxxd348xxx  recipients (0.2
mg/kg/h 27%; 0.6 mg/kg/h 81%; p < 0.05 for both
doses vs baseline) and in heparin recipients (91%;
p < 0.05 vs baseline).[10] there were no statistically
significant differences between either  xxxd348xxx 
regimen and heparin. in a study that included 55
patients with unstable angina, significant decreases
of plasma  xxxg784xxx  levels were seen at dosages of  xxxd348xxx  ≥0.25 mg/kg/h compared with
baseline (p < 0.01).[31] the dose-response was exponential, with the most consistent decreases in
 xxxg784xxx  levels seen at a dosage of 1
mg/kg/h.[31]

2.4 effect on  xxxg784xxx  levels

2.5 effect on platelet function

in patients undergoing pci,  xxxd348xxx  may be
more effective than heparin as an adjunct to
 xxxd53xxx  therapy in preventing platelet activadrugs 2002; 62 (5)

 xxxd348xxx : a review

tion. in a study in which 60 patients were
randomised to receive iv  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg
bolus then 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 hours) plus either iv heparin (administered to maintain the act
at 200 to 300 seconds) or  xxxd348xxx  (1 mg/kg bolus then 2.5 mg/kg/h for 4 hours),  xxxd348xxx  recipients had significantly less platelet inhibition at
4 hours than heparin recipients, as measured by
adp-induced aggregation (20 mumol/l adp: 91 vs
95%, p = 0.026). median inhibition was >80% of
target for both groups. in addition, 4 hours after the
start of treatment, significantly reduced levels of
the platelet activation marker beta-thromboglobulin were seen in  xxxd348xxx  compared with heparin recipients (4 hour/baseline ratio: 0.64 vs 0.89;
p = 0.045).[36]
2.6 effects of renal impairment

data from a review of unpublished studies indicate that mean aptt values are higher in patients
with severe renal impairment and in those requiring haemodialysis than in patients with normal renal function or moderate impairment.[37,38] in addition, among patients given  xxxd348xxx  (1 mg/kg
bolus followed by 2.5 mg/kg/h for 4 hours) steadystate acts are prolonged in those with moderate
renal impairment (391 seconds) compared with
those with mild impairment (365 seconds) or normal renal function (362 seconds).[38] these data are
consistent with the dose-response effect discussed
in sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 3.
3. pharmacokinetic profile
in the following section, a trial in healthy male
volunteers, which investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd348xxx  after sc as well as
single-dose and continuous iv administration, is discussed together with data from studies that enrolled patients undergoing ptca.

 xxxd348xxx  exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. peak
plasma concentrations are rapidly attained after
bolus injection. after 72-hour (0.25 to 1 mg/kg/h)
iv infusions of  xxxd348xxx  maximum plasma concentration (cmax) values were dose-proportional
(table ii).[28,35]
in healthy volunteers, cmax was reached between 15 and 19 minutes (tmax) after the start of the
infusion in those receiving 15-minute iv infusions
and at 2 minutes in those receiving an iv bolus of
 xxxd348xxx .[28] the cmax obtained when an iv bolus of  xxxd348xxx  0.3 mg/kg was administered was
37% greater than that achieved with the same dose
given by 15 minute iv infusion (table ii).[28] in
addition, a direct correlation was observed between the area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (auc) and the dose of infused  xxxd348xxx  (r = 0.9; p < 0.001). after sc injection, cmax
was ≈10% of that seen with iv administration and
tmax was 1 to 2 hours. bioavailability of  xxxd348xxx 
via the sc relative to the iv infusion route ranged
from 41 to 159%.[28]
among patients undergoing ptca, a mean
steady-state plasma  xxxd348xxx  concentration
(12 300 ± 1700 mug/l) was achieved after an iv bolus
of 1 mg/kg followed by a 4-hour iv infusion of 2.5
mg/kg/h. the mean plasma concentration was sustable ii. results of two randomised studies illustrating the relationship between dose and maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of

tained in the range 10 000 to 16 000 mug/l for the
duration of the 4-hour infusion. auc values were
dose proportional when 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg/h infusions were compared, indicating that pharmacokinetics retain linearity in this higher dosage range.
the mean volume of distribution of  xxxd348xxx 
was 0.156 l/kg.[39-41]
unlike heparin,  xxxd348xxx  does not bind to plasma proteins,  xxxg1726xxx  or red blood cells.[38,39]
3.2 metabolism and elimination

 xxxd348xxx  is rapidly cleared from plasma by a
combination of renal mechanisms and proteolytic
cleavage. [42] according to the manufacturer, following iv infusion  xxxd348xxx  has a total body
clearance rate of 0.204 l/kg/h and an elimination
half-life (t1⁄2) of 25 minutes in individuals with normal renal function undergoing pci.[39]
after iv or sc administration, up to 20% of the
dose is excreted in the urine. about 80% of bixvalirudin is degraded by proteolytic cleavage, including cleavage by thrombin with its protease, to
individual amino acids and small, essentially inactive peptide fragments.[43] following iv administration ≈70% of cumulative drug excretion is observed within 2 hours for most dosages.[28,35] renal
clearance is the primary route for elimination of
unchanged drug and  xxxd348xxx  clearance is 1.8fold greater than the glomerular filtration rate
(gfr),[38] suggesting that renal secretion occurs in
addition to filtration.
3.3 effect of disease and age

the clearance of  xxxd348xxx  is reduced in individuals with moderate or severe renal impairment.[37-39] the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd348xxx 
were studied in 40 individuals with renal impairment and the results are summarised in table iii.[37]
cmax, auc and t1⁄2 all increase progressively and
total body clearance decreases as the degree of renal impairment increases.[37] this is confirmed in
an unpublished study among 25 patients with normal, mild, or moderate renal impairment undergoing angioplasty at the recommended dosage of
 xxxd348xxx . the pharmacokinetic data in this study

are the only results derived using a  xxxd348xxx  specific assay. in patients with moderate renal impairment, auc and act (last 60 minutes) were significantly higher than in those who had normal renal
function (p < 0.001).[41] cmax was also increased in
those with moderate impairment compared with
those with normal renal function.
an unpublished analysis of major haemorrhage
incidences from a phase iii trial (n = 4312)[44] suggests gfr accounts for twice as much variability
in bleeding than either gender or age. the analysis
was reviewed by robson.[38] the gfr was responsible for nearly all the variability accounted for by
all three covariates together (r2 = 0.054 for gfr
vs 0.066 for gfr, gender or age) and the author states
the data indicate a need to reduce the dose of  xxxd348xxx  in patients with a gfr <3.6 l/h (see section
5).[38]
according to prescribing information the dose
of  xxxd348xxx  need not be adjusted in the elderly
per se; however, as most elderly individuals have
some degree of renal impairment, dosage adjustments may be necessary based on reduced renal
clearance.
3.4 drug interactions

in clinical trials that included patients undergoing ptca, coadministration of  xxxd348xxx  with
unfractionated heparin, warfarin or thrombolytics
was associated with an increased risk of bleeding
compared with that in patients not receiving these
concomitant medications;[39] however, data from a
study in 12 healthy volunteers indicate that immediate conversion of heparin to  xxxd348xxx  therapy
or vice versa can be accomplished with only transient changes in aptt levels (see section 6).[45]
preliminary drug-drug interaction studies of
 xxxd348xxx  with ticlopidine,  xxxd53xxx  and low
molecular weight heparin have not revealed any
clinically significant interactions.[39] in addition,
 xxxd348xxx  has been administered to patients with
ischaemic heart disease concomitantly taking a
broad range of cardiovascular medications.[40]

4. therapeutic use
in this section iv  xxxd348xxx  is evaluated in the
prevention of ischaemic complications after ptca
among patients with unstable angina (the only licensed indication; see section 6), as a treatment for
unstable angina without pci, or as an adjunct to
thrombolysis (with streptokinase) in patients presenting with mi. a small number of studies have
discussed the use of  xxxd348xxx  among patients
undergoing stenting procedures and these are
discussed briefly. for ethical reasons there are no
placebo-controlled trials; most studies are either
dose-ranging or compare  xxxd348xxx  with iv heparin (unfractionated).
4.1 percutaneous coronary
intervention (pci)

pcis are a broad range of techniques used for
the management of acute coronary syndromes.
these include ptca, implantation of intracoronary stents, laser angioplasty and various arthrectomy procedures. more than 500 000 pci procedures are performed yearly in the us.[46]

arteries in patients with unstable angina and in
those who have experienced an mi. during and
after this procedure there is a significant risk of
ischaemic complications.[30] two studies have
evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in the prevention of ischaemic complications following ptca:
an initial dose-finding trial[30] in patients with stable disease and the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study,
a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study in
patients with unstable or postinfarction angina.[44]
several subanalyses (prospective and retrospective)[47-51] and a recent reanalysis[52] of the latter
have been performed and are discussed together
with the primary results. the methodology of the
two studies is summarised in table iv.
taken together, the studies show  xxxd348xxx  to
demonstrate similar angiographic and procedural
outcomes compared with heparin and, based on a
reanalysis, to be more effective than heparin in preventing ischaemic complications (death, mi, revascularization) in patients undergoing ptca.
data from a prospectively randomised population[47] suggest that  xxxd348xxx  may also be significantly more effective than heparin in preventing
ischaemic outcomes among patients with post infarction angina.

 xxxd348xxx : a review

4.1.1 patients undergoing percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca)

in patients with stable disease, data from a dosefinding study indicate that a 4-hour infusion of
 xxxd348xxx  1.8 to 2.2 mg/kg/h may be useful as
sole anticoagulant therapy during ptca.[30] the
efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in 291 patients with stable
disease undergoing elective ptca was assessed in
a phase ii trial. five sequential dosage groups (0.6
to 2.2 mg/kg/h for 4 hours preceded by an initial
bolus of 25% of the infused dose) were used with
≈50 patients in each. a sixth group using a dosage
of 1 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 2.5
mg/kg/h was added later by protocol amendment.[56] acts and aptts were monitored throughout the treatment phase.
by intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of
death, mi, urgent revascularisation or abrupt vessel closure was significantly lower in the three
higher than in the three lower dosage groups (3.6
vs 12.5%; p = 0.006). the same applied when considering patients who completed ptca (3.8 vs
10.2%; p = 0.038).[56]
following on from the dose-finding study in
patients with stable disease, a well designed trial
( xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study) among 4312 enrolled patients with unstable angina demonstrated
 xxxd348xxx  (1 mg/kg bolus, then 2.5 mg/kg/h for 4
hours followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h for 14 to 20 hours)
was as effective as heparin (175 units/kg bolus followed by 15 units/kg/h for 18 to 24 hours) in preventing ischaemic complications due to ptca.[44]
the methodology of the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty
study is presented in table iv. patients had similar
baseline characteristics.  xxxd348xxx  was not titrated to act and heparin was administered to
achieve a target act of >350 seconds.
the primary endpoint was reached by 11.4% of
 xxxd348xxx  recipients compared with 12.2% of
heparin recipients. in addition, the incidence of any
clinical endpoint during hospitalisation in  xxxd348xxx  recipients was similar to that in heparin recipients (table v).
 xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective
than heparin in preventing procedural failure
among patients with postinfarction angina.[47] a

prospective subgroup analysis was performed in
741 patients undergoing ptca within 2 weeks of
a documented mi (confirmed by the presence of at
least two of the following: an elevation in the total
serum creatine kinase level of at least twice the
upper limit of normal; ecg changes; the presence
of ischaemic chest pain lasting >30 minutes). no
significant differences in baseline characteristics
were noted between treatment groups.  xxxd348xxx 
recipients were significantly less likely to have
procedural failure (the primary efficacy endpoint table v) than heparin recipients at any time after
study drug administration (5.1 vs 10.8%; p = 0.004)

results from a recent reanalysis of the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study using contemporary endpoints indicate  xxxd348xxx  is significantly more
effective than heparin in reducing ischaemic complications following ptca.[52] this reanalysis
used a composite primary endpoint of death, any
revascularisation, and enzymatic or ecg evidence
of mi. thus, the endpoint expanded the range of
enzyme elevations to be categorised as an mi, and
angiographic components of the endpoint were eliminated. in addition, the endpoints were analysed at
specific timepoints (7, 90 and 180 days). this eliminated the variable timepoint of hospital discharge
used in the original study. all analyses were conducted according to intention-to-treat principles.
neither the original analysis nor the reanalysis
strictly followed the protocol mandated analysis,
but the reanalysis formed the basis for product approval in the us.
 xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective
than heparin in reducing the incidence death, mi or
revascularization  xxxd2274xxx  and 90 days (p < 0.05) [table
vi]. at 180 days the difference was no longer significant (23 vs 24.7%). in addition,  xxxd2274xxx  and 90 days,
the incidence of revascularization was significantly lower in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients (p < 0.05). the incidences of death and mi
were similar between treatment groups at all
timepoints.
in the prospective subgroup of patients with
postinfarction angina, similar results to the original
study were observed.  xxxd348xxx  recipients were
significantly less likely to experience death, mi or
revascularization (primary endpoint) than heparin
recipients  xxxd2274xxx  and 90 days (p < 0.01). at 180 days,
between treatment-group differences remained significant (18.7 vs 25.3, p = 0.049). at both 7 and 90
days the incidence of revascularization was significantly less in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients
(p < 0.05; table vi).
various retrospective subgroup analyses of the
 xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study have been conducted.[48-51,57] the results of these analyses show
that  xxxd348xxx  is as effective as heparin among
patients with thrombus-containing lesions and

 xxxd348xxx , like heparin, does not significantly affect the occurrence of restenosis after ptca.
according to data from a retrospective subgroup
analysis,  xxxd348xxx  is as effective as heparin in preventing ischaemic complications in patients with
thrombus-containing lesions on angiography; however, angiographic determination of thrombus is
often difficult.[48] 567 patients were included in the
analysis, of whom 266 received heparin. some significant differences in baseline clinical variables
existed between treatment groups.  xxxd348xxx  recipients were less likely to have had chest pain at
rest, 48 hours before angioplasty (64 vs 72%; p =
0.05), or to have received pretreatment with heparin before randomisation (34 vs 46%; p = 0.004).
there were also significant differences between
groups in the level of anticoagulation, as measured
by the act. there were no significant differences
in the incidence of any individual ischaemic complication during hospitalisation between treatment
groups. this was also true 6 months after the procedure.
in a further retrospective subanalysis of 95 patients with thrombus-containing lesions who had
filling defects on angiography, no significant differences in the incidence of any clinical endpoint
between  xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients were
observed (nonfatal mi 4.0 vs 2.2%, need for emergency bypass surgery 0% in both groups, composite endpoint 4.0 vs 2.2%, abrupt vessel closure 20.1
vs11.1%),[48] although the sample size was too
small to make any definitive conclusions.
 xxxd348xxx , like heparin, does not significantly
affect the occurrence of restenosis after ptca. in
a retrospective subgroup analysis, 87 patients, of
whom 37 received  xxxd348xxx , were evaluated at 6
months’ follow-up.[57] the incidence of the primary endpoint of restenosis (defined as ≥50% diameter stenosis at follow-up) was similar in both
 xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients (62.2 vs 58%; p
= 0.7). baseline angiographic measurements and
minimal lumen diameter after angioplasty (≈1.44mm
± 0.37) and at follow-up (≈1.03 mm ± 0.56) were
similar for both treatment groups. in addition,
 xxxd348xxx  had no significant effect on established
drugs 2002; 62 (5)

risk factors for restenosis. the power of the study
to detect a 50% reduction in the restenosis rate was
54%; however, the authors state that as no trends
in favour of treatment were observed a higher powered study was not needed.[57]
two further retrospective subgroup analyses
have been reported as abstracts.[49,51] in one analysis  xxxd348xxx  was shown to be significantly more
effective than heparin in reducing ischaemic rebound (defined as death, mi or urgent revascularisation) following abrupt discontinuation of
anticoagulation therapy,[49] and in the other switching to  xxxd348xxx  treatment within 1 hour of initiating heparin therapy was shown to reduce the incidence of major clinical events.[51] in a subgroup
analysis of 2796 patients undergoing at least 18
hours of anticoagulation, 1313 received  xxxd348xxx 
and 1483 received heparin.[49] significantly fewer
 xxxd348xxx  recipients suffered ischaemic rebound
than heparin recipients (11 vs 30; p = 0.001). the
incidence of composite endpoints was significantly less in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients
(0.7 vs 2.3%; p = 0.001). in 1006 patients undergoing ptca within 1 hour of heparin therapy, a
second analysis evaluated whether switching to
 xxxd348xxx  therapy would affect the incidence of
major clinical events. the incidence of death, mi
or revascularisation was less in  xxxd348xxx  recipients (n = 512) than in those who remained on hep© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

arin (n = 494) [6.4 vs 9.9%, or = 0.61; 95% ci
0.38 to 0.97].[51]
a post-hoc analysis of the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study investigated the relationship between abrupt vessel closure and act values.[50]
unlike in  xxxd348xxx  recipients, in patients treated
with heparin the risk of abrupt vessel closure was
inversely related to the initial act value taken 5
minutes after administration of heparin. for every
10-second increase in the initial act value the
probability of abrupt vessel closure decreased by
1.3% (95% ci -2.4 to 0.2%; p = 0.02). in  xxxd348xxx  recipients the response was flat for initial
values; however, unlike in heparin recipients, in
patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  there was a positive correlation between the probability of abrupt
vessel closure and the maximum act (or = 0.6%
for every 10-second increase in maximum act;
95% ci 0.2 to 1%, p = 0.002). in summary, these
data suggest a more predictable initial anticoagulant response with  xxxd348xxx . in heparin recipients, the risk of abrupt vessel closure is related to
the patient’s initial responsiveness to anticoagulation, which is not predictable.[50]

plantation of intracoronary stents; therefore, this
section discusses two recent small nonblind studies
among patients undergoing stenting procedures or
other pci. preliminary results indicate  xxxd348xxx 
may have a role to play in the management of ischaemic complications following these procedures.
an abstract of a randomised study that enrolled
208 patients (methodology summarised in table
iv) undergoing elective pci, 88% of whom received stents, reported data which indicate  xxxd348xxx  in combination with provisional  xxxd53xxx 
may provide an effective anticoagulant regimen for
patients undergoing intracoronary stent placement.[54]  xxxd348xxx  recipients (24% of whom received  xxxd53xxx ) had a reduced incidence of any
unfavourable clinical outcome compared with  xxxd53xxx /heparin recipients (3.5 vs 14.1%; p =
0.013). there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of the individual clinical outcomes. double-blind trials
published in full are awaited.
 xxxd348xxx  may have a role to play in the management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia who are undergoing pci. an interim report from a noncomparative study [anticoagulant
therapy with  xxxd348xxx  to assist in pci (atbat)
- for methodology see table iv] reported two minor
bleeds and no other clinical events, 48 hours after
the procedure, in 11 patients with heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia who received  xxxd348xxx  for the
prevention of ischaemic complications.[55] all procedures were successful, as defined by timi grade
3 flow or <50% residual stenosis. timi grade flows
0 and 1 indicate complete or nearly complete occlusion, grade 2 flow denotes delayed perfusion,
and grade 3 flow indicates full perfusion with brisk
coronary flow. full results of the trial have yet to
be published.
4.2 unstable angina without pci

the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in the treatment of
unstable angina in patients not undergoing pci has
been assessed in two pilot dose-ranging studies.[29,35] neither study was sufficiently powered to
detect differences in the incidence of clinical end© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

points. taken together, they suggest  xxxd348xxx 
may have potential in the treatment of unstable angina. a third trial [timi (thrombin inhibition in
myocardial ischaemia) 8] was prematurely terminated for financial reasons and results are therefore
limited.[58]
the earlier trial was a study that included 55
patients, the first 15 of whom took part in an initial
dose-escalating study.[35] five consecutive 30-minute infusions of  xxxd348xxx  (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25,
and 0.5 mg/kg/h) were given to each of the 15 patients. the remaining 40 patients entered a further
dose-escalating study in which they received a 72hour infusion of  xxxd348xxx  (0.25, 0.5 or 1
mg/kg/h). the study was designed so that the dose
was increased when clinical control was not achieved
in two patients.
the recurrence of ischaemic chest pain, within
the first 24 hours after discontinuation of  xxxd348xxx , occurred in significantly less 1 mg/kg/h recipients than in those receiving the lower dosages
of  xxxd348xxx  (1 vs 6 patients; p < 0.05). no deaths
or mis were recorded in any patient during hospitalisation, and no severe refractory angina was observed after the discontinuation of the  xxxd348xxx 
infusion. recurrent chest pain during the infusion
period occurred in 12.5% of patients.
timi 7 was a dose-response trial among 401
evaluable patients.[29] the methodology is summarised in table vii.
baseline characteristics were similar between
each of the four dosage groups. a smaller proportion of  xxxd348xxx  1 mg/kg/h recipients received
postinfusion heparin than recipients of the lower
doses (p = 0.03).
the primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of unsatisfactory outcome at 72 hours. analysis of the results took place at the end of the 72hour  xxxd348xxx  infusion and at hospital discharge.
at both timepoints there was no difference in the
incidence of unsatisfactory outcome between any
of the four dosage groups (figure 1). at hospital
discharge, the incidence of recurrent ischaemia at
rest with ecg changes was similar between dosage
groups (6 to 8%). in addition, patients who redrugs 2002; 62 (5)

ceived one of the three higher dosages were significantly less likely to suffer a secondary endpoint of
death or nonfatal mi than low-dosage recipients at
both hospital discharge (3.2 vs 10%; p = 0.008) and
6 weeks after the start of the infusion (5.2 vs
12.5%; p = 0.009) . larger well designed studies
are needed to confirm the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in
the treatment of unstable angina without pci.
in the timi 8 trial, 133 patients (of a planned
5320) with unstable angina or non-q wave mi were
randomised to receive treatment with  xxxd348xxx

15 units/kg/h for 72 hours). data from timi 8 concur with the results of the two previous studies.
over a 2-week period, death and mi were reported

recipients (or 0.3; 95% ci 0.06 to 1.53).[58]
4.3 myocardial infarction

four randomised trials, two of which were double-blind,[32,34] have compared the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  with that of heparin in the treatment of
patients with acute st elevation mi.[31-34] three
were designed to detect differences between treatment regimens in early coronary patency parameters (intermediate endpoints)[31,32,34] and the fourth
[hirulog early reperfusion/occlusion (hero)2][33] was designed to detect differences in major
clinical endpoints such as 30-day mortality (primary endpoint) and reinfarction. taken together,
these trials indicate  xxxd348xxx  is significantly
more effective than heparin in improving early patency and reducing the risk of 96-hour and inhospital reinfarction, and is as effective as heparin
in reducing 30-day mortality.
trials that evaluated early patency used the
timi grading system.[53] patency is customarily
taken to refer to achievement of timi grade 2 or 3
flow in clinical studies.
results from three of these studies indicate that
early patency (timi grade 3 flow at 120 minutes)
was significantly more likely to occur in  xxxd348xxx  than heparin recipients.[31,32,34] in an early
nonblind pilot study, 45 patients who experienced
an mi with chest pain lasting >6 hours and st elevation were randomised to receive either heparin
(1000 units/h for 12 hours then titrated to maintain
aptt 2 to 2.5 times control) or  xxxd348xxx  (0.5
mg/kg/h for 12 hours then 0.1 mg/kg/h).[31] in addition, all patients received streptokinase (1.5 million units over 45 to 60 minutes) and aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ) 325 mg/day. the infusions were
continued for ≈4.5 days. at 120 minutes, timi 3
flow was observed in 40% of heparin versus 77%
of  xxxd348xxx  recipients [relative risk (rr) 1.92;

< 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in timi grade 3 flow between treatment
groups (40 vs 67%; p = 0.08). of 84% of patients
who had further angiograms, 4.7 ± 0.7 days after
admission, only one patient had reocclusion. the
study did not have sufficient statistical power to
detect significant differences in the incidence of
clinical endpoints.[31]
a double-blind trial among 68 evaluable patients with st elevation mi confirmed the results
of the early pilot study (see table viii for methodology).[34] patients were randomised to receive either a low- (0.5 mg/kg/h for 12 hours followed by
0.1 mg/kg/h) or high-dose (1 mg/kg/h for 12 hours

arin (500 units/h bolus followed by 100 units/h for
12 hours then titrated to maintain aptt 2 to 2.5
times control). treatment was continued for 4 to 6
days.
timi grade 3 flow at 120 minutes was significantly more likely with both dosages of  xxxd348xxx 
than with heparin (rr = 1.73; 95% ci 0.95 to 3.16,
p = 0.02). interestingly, data from the study indicate that low-dose  xxxd348xxx  recipients were significantly more likely to have early patency at 90
and 120 minutes than high-dose recipients (90 min:
85 vs 61%, p = 0.048; 120 min: 92 vs 68%; p =
0.034). the relative risks of restoring timi grade
3 flow with low-dose versus high-dose  xxxd348xxx 
were 1.40 (95% ci 1.00 to 1.97; p = 0.04) and 1.36
(95% ci 1.04 to 1.8; p = 0.02) at 90 and 120 minutes, respectively. after 4 to 6 days, patency was
still present in 96% of low-dose and 81% of highdose  xxxd348xxx  recipients. in 83% of heparin recipients the vessels remained patent. no significant
differences in the incidence of clinical endpoints
were observed.[34]
results from the hero-1 trial[32] confirm that
 xxxd348xxx  is significantly more effective than
heparin in improving early patency parameters.
hero-1 was a large, double-blind, multicentre
trial that enrolled 412 patients with mi, of whom
393 were evaluated. the methodology is summarised in table viii. patients were randomised to receive either high-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h for 12 hours then
0.25mg/kg/h), low-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.125 mg/kg
bolus followed by 0.25 mg/kg/h for 12 hours then
0.125 mg/kg/h) or heparin (5000 unit bolus followed by 1000 to 1200 units/h). treatment was
continued for up to 60 hours.
 xxxd348xxx  recipients were significantly more
likely to have timi grade 3 flow at 90 to 120 minutes than heparin recipients (47 vs 35%; p = 0.02).
70% of heparin recipients, 78% of low-dose  xxxd348xxx  recipients and 77% of high-dose  xxxd348xxx  recipients had sustained patency improvement at 3 days. in addition, time of treatment from
symptom onset affected the treatment outcomes.

patients with mi were randomised to receive either
heparin (n = 8557) or  xxxd348xxx  (8516) in a nonblind, multicentre trial. the methodology is summarised in table viii. the primary endpoint was
30-day mortality and the major secondary endpoints were adjudicated reinfarction and bleeding
(see section 5). the target aptt was 50 to 75 seconds. analysis of baseline characteristics revealed
that more women were randomised to  xxxd348xxx

the results of six randomised trials of  xxxd348xxx  among patients with unstable angina or
acute st elevation mi have been combined in a
systematic overview.[60] the overview consisted of
two separate analyses: dose-ranging studies (two
trials; n = 701) and heparin-controlled trials (4 trials; n = 4973). comparison of subtherapeutic and
active doses showed a significant reduction in mi
associated with therapeutic doses of  xxxd348xxx 
(or 0.3; 95% ci 0.12 to 0.73; p = 0.009).
the analysis[60] of the heparin-controlled trials[32,34,44] was dominated by the largest trial[44]
(87% of all patients) [see section 4.1]. in addition,
a further trial (timi 8) was terminated after the
enrolment of 133 (of a planned 5320) patients (see
section 4.2). heterogeneity analysis revealed no
significant heterogeneity for any endpoint with the
exception of the incidence of mi after 30 to 50 days
of follow-up (p = 0.05).
the main results are summarised in table ix.
seven days after treatment was initiated, no significant difference in the incidence of any clinical
endpoint was observed between  xxxd348xxx  and
heparin regimens. after 30 to 50 days of follow-up,
 xxxd348xxx  was significantly more effective than
heparin in reducing the incidence of nonfatal mi (p
= 0.035) and the combined endpoint of death/nonfatal mi (p = 0.02). the absolute risk difference

in this section, detailed information from three
large, randomised, pivotal trials is presented.
these trials compare the tolerability profile of heparin with  xxxd348xxx  among patients with unstable
angina undergoing ptca[44] and in those with
mi.[32,59]
the most significant clinical risks associated
with  xxxd348xxx  are bleeding complications.[39] in
the trials discussed in this section, bleeding was
defined as major if it was clinically overt with either a fall in haemoglobin level of ≥3 g/dl or the
requirement for transfusion, or if it was retroperitoneal or intracranial. minor bleeding was defined
as clinically overt but failing to meet the aforementioned criteria. comparative data from the manufacturer detailing adverse events other than bleeding complications are also presented.[39]
5.1 unstable angina

 xxxd348xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of bleeding than heparin in patients undergoing ptca for unstable or postinfarction angina.
following initial dose-finding studies which observed low rates of bleeding complications with
 xxxd348xxx  treatment,[29,30] a study among 4312
patients, 214 of whom received the study drugs but
failed to undergo angioplasty, reported that the incidence of retroperitoneal bleeding, blood transfusion or major haemorrhage was significantly lower
in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients (p < 0.05
vs heparin for all three parameters (figure 3).[44]
odds ratios were 0.3 (95% ci 0.1 to 0.9), 0.4 (95%
ci 0.3 to 0.6) and 0.4 (95% ci 0.3 to 0.5), respectively. this was observed against a background of
a lower level of anticoagulation in  xxxd348xxx  than
in heparin recipients. median act values and
interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentile) were
lower in  xxxd348xxx  than in heparin recipients [346
(305 to 405) vs 383 (332 to 450) seconds; p <
0.001]. in addition, 37% of heparin recipients re© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

their act levels were below the 350 second target.
current american college of cardiology/american heart association (acc/aha) guidelines recommend an act range of 300 to 350 seconds in
patients receiving heparin, using the hemochron
device.[46] pooled data from well designed trials
suggest a possible correlation between maximum
act and the incidence of major and minor bleeding.[61] no other tolerability problems were reported in this study.[44]
according to the manufacturer,[39] the percentages of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events were similar in the heparin and  xxxd348xxx  groups (83 vs 82%) in the  xxxd348xxx 
angioplasty study (data not included in the original study report).[44] the most frequent treatmentemergent events in  xxxd348xxx  recipients were

ache (12%) and hypotension (12%) [figure 4].[39]
no notable abnormalities in laboratory values were
seen and the manufacturer states the overall tolerability profile of  xxxd348xxx  is consistent with a
lack of antibody formation.[40]
5.2 myocardial infarction

according to data from the hero-2 trial (n =
17 073),[59]  xxxd348xxx  recipients had a significantly higher incidence of mild or moderate bleeding than heparin recipients (table x). the incidences of stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and
severe bleeding were slightly higher in  xxxd348xxx 
than in heparin recipients; however, statistical significance was not reached in any of the three
events. in addition, there was no significant difference among  xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients in
the incidence of bleeding requiring blood transfusion (table x). twelve-hour aptt values and inter50

quartile ranges (25th to 75th percentile) in  xxxd348xxx  recipients were significantly higher than
those among heparin recipients [108 (83 to 141) vs
77 (56 to 118) seconds; p < 0.0001]. the difference
was also significant at 24 hours [80 (64 to 100) vs
57 (43 to 74) seconds; p < 0.0001].[59]
in contrast, data from the hero-1 trial[32] indicate a significantly lower incidence of major bleeding (14 vs 27%; p < 0.01) and the need for a blood
transfusion (9 vs 19%; p = 0.02) in patients treated
with low-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.125 mg/kg iv bolus
followed by 0.25 mg/kg/h for 12 hours then 0.125
mg/kg/h for 60 hours) than in heparin recipients
(5000 units iv bolus followed by 1000 to 1200
units/h). eleven and 24 hours after commencement
of streptokinase treatment, aptt values were
lower in patients treated with low-dose  xxxd348xxx 
than in those treated with heparin (11 hours: 96 ±

5.3 meta-analysis

a meta-analysis of six randomised trials that enrolled 5674 patients evaluated the tolerability profile of  xxxd348xxx  in the treatment for ischaemic
heart disease.[60] 4603 patients underwent ptca
and 1071 received treatment for acute coronary
syndromes. in heparin-controlled trials that included 4964 evaluable patients,  xxxd348xxx  recipients were at a significantly lower risk of haemorrhagic events than heparin recipients (or 0.41;
95% ci 0.32 to 0.52; p < 0.001). the absolute risk
difference was equal to 58 fewer events per 1000
patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  (–0.058; 95% ci
–0.072 to –0.043).[60] levels of anticoagulation
were not reported.
6. dosage and administration
 xxxd348xxx  is indicated as an anticoagulant in
patients with unstable angina undergoing ptca.
us prescribing information states  xxxd348xxx  is intended for use only in patients receiving concomitant aspirin (300 to 325 mg/day). it is not currently
approved for the treatment of other thrombotic disorders discussed in this review.
the approved iv dosage for adults and elderly
patients is a bolus of 1 mg/kg followed by a 4-hour
infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h. a further infusion of 0.2
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

mg/kg/h may be given for an additional 20 hours
at the discretion of the prescribing physician. currently, a lower dosage (bolus of 0.75 mg/kg followed by 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the
procedure) is under investigation.[62] treatment
should be initiated just prior to ptca. dosage adjustments are not required per se in the elderly;
however, adjustments are required in patients with
renal impairment (table xi) [see section 3.3] and
therefore the anticoagulant status of elderly recipients of the drug should be monitored.
 xxxd348xxx  has not been studied in patients <21
years of age or specifically in patients with hepatic
impairment, although this later patient population
was not excluded from the clinical trials. studies
of the use of  xxxd348xxx  in pregnant women are
lacking, and it is not known whether  xxxd348xxx  is
excreted in the breast milk. women treated with
 xxxd348xxx  should not breast feed their infants during treatment or for at least 12 hours after treatment
ends.[40]  xxxd348xxx  is contraindicated in patients
with active major bleeding, or a hypersensitivity to
 xxxd348xxx  or its components.
 xxxd348xxx  should be administered via a dedicated iv line; no other medications should be
mixed with  xxxd348xxx  before or during administration.  xxxd348xxx  should not be given by intramuscular injection.
in patients switching from heparin, ideally heparin should be discontinued at least 30 minutes
prior to the administration of  xxxd348xxx . in addidrugs 2002; 62 (5)

there is no known antidote to  xxxd348xxx  and
no experience of overdose in human clinical trials.
in the case of overdose,  xxxd348xxx  should be discontinued and the patient closely monitored for
signs of bleeding.[39,40]
7. place of  xxxd348xxx  in the
management of acute
coronary syndromes
heparins are currently the most widely used anticoagulants in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes; however, as discussed in sections 2.1 and
3.1, they have a number of limitations resulting in
a variable anticoagulant response and a risk of
bleeding. heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is
also a risk. the variable response results in the need
to monitor the act/aptt and adjust the dose accordingly. these characteristics of heparin make
combination therapy with antiplatelet agents more
complicated. as a result, recombinant hirudins, including  xxxd348xxx , were developed. these are
specific thrombin inhibitors which, unlike heparin,
act independently of antithrombin and inactivate
both fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin (see section 2.1).
in contrast to heparin, the anticoagulant effect
of  xxxd348xxx  shows little intraindividual and predictable interindividual variation (see sections
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

2.3.2 and 3.1) and as a consequence it can be administered as a constant infusion with little need to
monitor aptt or act values. in addition,  xxxd348xxx  does not bind to plasma proteins or red blood
cells, displays linear pharmacokinetics and has a
short half-life (see sections 3.1 and 3.2).
7.1 pci

the only licensed indication for  xxxd348xxx  is
as an anticoagulant in patients with unstable angina
undergoing ptca; however, studies have investigated its use for preventing ischaemic complications in patients undergoing stent placement (see
sections 4.1.2 and 6). ptca has been used as a
means of revascularisation for the treatment of unstable angina since the early 1980s.[63] the outcome of a pci procedure is defined in terms of
angiographic and procedural success. according to
acc/aha guidelines a successful pci should
achieve substantial enlargement of the lumen at the
target site without in-hospital major clinical complications.[46] in addition, the patient should obtain
relief of signs and symptoms of myocardial ischaemia for more than 6 months after the procedure,
of which restenosis is a key determinant.
two major complications associated with pcis
are haemorrhage and postprocedural ischaemic
events. in an investigation involving 1258 patients
treated at one clinic between 1992 and 1993, 28%
of in-hospital costs resulted from induced complications.[64] early complications of pcis are caused
by arterial thrombus formation at the site of vessel
injury. arterial thrombi are rich in platelets, erythrocytes, fibrin and leucocytes.[65]
since pcis were first developed, heparin has
been the prime pharmacological intervention.[66] in
addition, studies[67,68] in the 1980s demonstrated
the beneficial effect of aspirin in pci and the two
together have become an important part of current
guidelines.[46] nevertheless, despite the widespread
use of this combination, early ischaemic complications continued to occur[69,70] and attention was focused on improving both the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of this regimen. the addition of
 xxxd1914xxx  and adjunctive thrombolytic therapy
drugs 2002; 62 (5)

 xxxd348xxx : a review

was investigated. however, it was found that  xxxd1914xxx  provided no significant improvement[71] and thrombolytic therapy (urokinase) significantly worsened clinical outcomes.[72]
unlike aspirin, which blocks only thromboxane
a2-dependent pathways of platelet aggregation,
glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonists are a class of
compounds which inhibit platelet aggregation in
response to all agonists including collagen and
thrombin. their use as an addition to heparin and
aspirin therapy has been investigated in several trials[73-75] and they have been shown to significantly
reduce the incidence of ischaemic complications,
though not bleeding complications. although most
benefit has been seen with  xxxd53xxx ,[75-77] other
agents such as  xxxd3385xxx [74] and  xxxd2017xxx [73] have
shown beneficial effects. iv glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors have now become part of the current pci
guidelines with the recommendation that their use
be considered particularly in patients with unstable
angina or with other clinical characteristics of high
risk.[46]
 xxxd348xxx  and other specific antithrombins
were developed in order to obtain a more specific
and a greater antithrombotic effect than was obtained with heparin. in the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty
study and subsequent subanalyses,  xxxd348xxx 
was shown to be as effective as heparin in preventing procedural failure among patients undergoing
ptca (see section 4.1.1). this was achieved
against a background of a significantly lower incidence of bleeding complications than heparin (see
section 5.1). in addition, a prospective analysis of
the study, which included pre-specified, randomised high-risk patients with a recent mi, demonstrated that  xxxd348xxx  was more effective than
heparin in preventing death, mi or revascularisation (see section 4.1.1). additional evidence from
a recent reanalysis of the original study suggests
 xxxd348xxx  may be more effective than heparin in
reducing ischaemic complications for up to 90
days after treatment commenced in the entire cohort, and for up to 180 days in patients with postinfarction angina; however, expert opinion has
suggested that this reanalysis be considered hy© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

pothesis generating and should not be considered
definitive.[78].
to date, limited pharmacoeconomic data are
available on the use of  xxxd348xxx  in patients with
unstable angina undergoing ptca. results of one
analysis based on the results of the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study have been published.[79] in brief,
the analysis used clinical efficacy data from the
 xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study and applied clinical
cost data from three other studies. for all patients,
the potential cost saving per patient of using
 xxxd348xxx  over heparin was between $us591 and
$us843 (year of costing not reported). in patients
with post-mi, the potential savings ranged from
$us914 to $us1411. although these data appear
promising, acquisition costs are much higher with
 xxxd348xxx  than with heparin and pharmacoeconomic analyses conducted prospectively alongside
well designed trials are needed to demonstrate cost
effectiveness.
coronary stenting is a pci procedure which, together with pharmacological intervention, has
had a significant impact on the acute risk of major
ischaemic complications and late-term restenosis.[46] seventy percent of pci procedures now involve coronary stenting.[46] the most common and
costly complication of pci is bleeding.[80] in patients undergoing stent placement, some interim
data suggest  xxxd348xxx  may be useful in patients
with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and, in
addition, preliminary evidence exists to suggest
 xxxd348xxx  may be a more effective addition to
 xxxd53xxx  therapy than heparin (see section 4.1.2).
in summary,  xxxd348xxx  has been shown to be
an effective alternative to heparin in preventing ischaemic complications among patients with unstable angina undergoing ptca. evidence from a
prospective analysis of pre-stratified post mi patients and a retrospective reanalysis of the  xxxd348xxx  angioplasty study suggests  xxxd348xxx 
may have superior efficacy to heparin both in patients with a recent mi and in the entire cohort.
further evidence from well designed trials is
needed to confirm the drug’s superior efficacy in
the modern interventional setting, including the

use of stents and glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors.
data from the atbat trial are awaited with interest.
7.2 unstable angina

the veterans administration cooperative study
(vacs) in 1983 produced strong evidence in favour of antiplatelet drug therapy in patients with
unstable angina. short-term aspirin therapy reduced the incidence of death and mi by 51% compared with placebo.[81] subsequent studies have
confirmed the beneficial effect of aspirin therapy
in unstable angina[82-84] and present us guidelines
recommend aspirin should be administered to all
patients with unstable angina, unless specifically
contraindicated.[85] subsequent to the vacs, several studies investigated the use of heparin alone
and in combination with aspirin among patients
with unstable angina.[83,86-89] taken together, these
studies demonstrated heparin was at least as effective as aspirin in preventing the risk of mi; however, when used in combination not only was there
a significant synergistic effect, but the risk of reactivation of unstable angina, seen with heparin treatment,[87] was reduced. in general, patients received
low-dose aspirin (<324 mg/day) and heparin at a
dose adjusted to produce an aptt of ≈60 to 75
seconds.[90]
although the combination of aspirin and heparin has become widely accepted as the foundation
for acute treatment of unstable angina,[14,85,90] it is
by no means ideal. aspirin provides incomplete
platelet inactivation and the disadvantages of heparin therapy have been discussed earlier in section
7. in order to achieve more complete platelet inactivation, current acc/aha guidelines suggest the
addition of an iv glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor in
high-risk patients.[85]
 xxxd348xxx  overcomes many of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic disadvantages of
heparin (see sections 2.1 and 3.1). in pilot studies,
 xxxd348xxx  has shown potential in the treatment of
unstable angina (see section 4.2). well designed
comparative studies with heparin and trials evaluating the combination of  xxxd348xxx  and iv glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors are required.

7.3 myocardial infarction

current guidelines recommend the use of a
thrombolytic, antiplatelet and antithrombotic agent
in the acute management of an mi with st segment
elevation.[91] the most common regimen has been
streptokinase, aspirin and heparin (either sc or
iv); however, despite the use of this regimen, clinical outcomes in patients with mi have still not
been optimised. indeed, only 30 to 60% of patients
achieve timi grade 3 flow at 90 minutes,[92] 30day mortality rates typically range from 6 to 8% in
major clinical trials, and rates of reinfarction remain around 4%.[93-96] in addition, haemorrhage
remains a concern with rates of intracranial bleeding ranging from 0.5 to 0.9% and rates of transfusion of at least 2%.[93-96]
efforts to improve the beneficial effects of this
standard regimen have focused on improving the
efficacy of all three components. attempts to improve the antiplatelet component of the regimen
have recently concentrated on the use of iv glycoprotein inhibitors iib/iiia.  xxxd53xxx  given with
both low-dose heparin and  xxxd3308xxx  has shown
promising results when compared with full-dose
heparin and  xxxd3308xxx .[97] however, the first
mortality mega trial of  xxxd53xxx  with reteplase
[global use of strategies to open occluded coronary arteries (gusto v)][98] showed no mortality
benefit, with a significant increase in bleeding
complications. investigator-reported reinfarction
was reduced.
early thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase
and urokinase are nonspecific fibrinolytic agents
that produce systemic breakdown of the coagulation system. this results in reduced clot lysis, increased risk of haemorrhage, and failure to achieve
optimum reperfusion. newer agents such as  xxxg1766xxx  and reteplase are more fibrin specific. in the
gusto trial,  xxxg1766xxx  given with iv heparin provided a significant survival benefit over streptokinase given with either iv or sc heparin.[96] in
theory, the need for concomitant systemic anticoagulation with antithrombotics should be more
with these newer agents, as the coagulation system
is less affected. current guidelines recommend iv
drugs 2002; 62 (5)

 xxxd348xxx : a review

heparin to be given to all patients receiving  xxxg1766xxx , and in patients at high risk of systemic emboli who receive nonselective thrombolytics.[91]
according to present acc/aha recommendations, the most effective therapy for achieving
early coronary reperfusion is  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase
in combination with iv heparin.[91]
the deficiencies of heparin as an antithrombotic
agent have been discussed earlier in section 7.
 xxxd348xxx , as a specific antithrombin, overcomes
many of the drawbacks of heparin therapy. in clinical trials of patients with acute st elevation mi,
 xxxd348xxx  has been shown to be significantly
more effective than heparin in improving early patency parameters (see section 4.3). in addition, results from the hero-2 trial (see section 4.3) indicate that these benefits translate into improved
clinical endpoints.  xxxd348xxx  was significantly
more effective than heparin in reducing adjudicated 96-hour and 30-day investigator-eported
death/reinfarction; early reinfarction following
thrombolysis has been associated with an increased risk of further reinfarction, heart failure
and death.[99] although  xxxd348xxx  was as effective as heparin in reducing 30-day mortality
longer-term data may be needed to demonstrate
any superior mortality effect.
in summary, the place of  xxxd348xxx  in the management of mi is not yet clear. results from the
hero-2 trial indicate  xxxd348xxx  can replace heparin when streptokinase is used as the thrombolytic; however, trials are awaited investigating the
combination of  xxxd348xxx  with newer thrombolytic agents such as  xxxg1766xxx . in addition, trials
investigating the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in combination with iv glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors are
needed.
7.4 tolerability issues

in patients with unstable angina undergoing
ptca, treatment-emergent events are similar between  xxxd348xxx  and heparin recipients. a metaanalysis provides some promising evidence to suggest  xxxd348xxx  recipients have a lower risk of
haemorrhagic events than heparin recipients across

all indications (see section 5.3). in addition, evidence exists from both pharmacodynamic (see section 2.3.1) and clinical trials (see section 2.3.2) to
show that  xxxd348xxx  provides a more consistent,
predictable anticoagulant response than heparin,
thus enabling the balance between a reduction in
ischaemic complications and an increase in bleeding risk to be more easily obtained than with heparin.
7.5 conclusion

in conclusion,  xxxd348xxx  is an effective alternative to heparin in the prevention of ischaemic
complications in patients with unstable angina undergoing ptca. in addition, the drug has shown
potential in the treatment of patients with unstable
angina not undergoing pci. for patients with mi,
it is clear that  xxxd348xxx  can replace heparin in the
management of mi where streptokinase is used as
the thrombolytic agent. further data are required
on the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in patients undergoing thrombolysis with newer thrombolytics.
