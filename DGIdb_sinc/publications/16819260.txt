[retinoid therapy for autoimmune diseases].  retinoid is a collective term for compounds which bind to and activate  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (raralpha, beta, gamma and rxralpha, beta, gamma), members of nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  superfamily. the most important endogeneous retinoid is  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) which is an raralpha, beta and gamma ligand. atra and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl) and some skin diseases. many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. among them,  xxxd3284xxx  ( xxxd3284xxx ) is an raralpha- and rarbeta-specific (but rargamma- and rxrs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed apl. experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. on this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. in particular, th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.
