new progestagens for contraceptive use
regine sitruk-ware
rockefeller university and population council, new york, ny, usa

the progestins have different pharmacologic properties depending upon the parent molecule, usually testosterone or
progesterone (p), from which they are derived. very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. in hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major
agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (e) usually ethinyl-estradiol
(ee). the development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge.
steroidal and nonsteroidal  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are
still in a very early stage of development. several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. these
include dienogest (dng),  xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx ), nestorone (nes), nomegestrol acetate (nomac) and trimegestone
(tmg). these new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in
activity to the physiological hormone p.  xxxd1946xxx  differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from  xxxd3238xxx . it
is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. the
antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. tmg and nes are the most potent progestins synthesized to
date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto- xxxd1849xxx  (keto-dsg) and levonorgestrel (lng). the new molecules tmg,  xxxd1946xxx  and dng also have antiandrogenic activity. striking differences exist regarding the side effects
among the progestins and the combination with ee leads to other reactions related to the e itself and whether the
associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. the 19-norprogesterone molecules and the
new molecules  xxxd1946xxx  and dng are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the lipid profile. given
their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular
risks. however, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.

introduction
the progestagens or progestogens include both progesterone (p),
the hormone secreted by ovary and placenta and the synthetic steroids or progestins that mimic the actions of endogenous p. the
new progestagens are, by definition, progestins, and this term will
be used throughout the review. several new progestins have been
synthesized in the last decade for use in both contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies (hrts) (stanczyk, 2002; sitruk-ware,
2004).
one of the main actions of p or a progestin is the secretory
transformation of an estrogen-primed (e-primed) endometrium. p
or a progestin prevents the over-proliferation of the endometrial
tissue, but the degree to which this effect is achieved depends
upon the antiestrogenic properties of the progestin and the dose
and duration of treatment. as contraceptive agents, progestins
with high anti-gonadotropic potency ensure suppression of ovulation and are combined with e in most hormonal contraceptives,
combined oral contraceptives (ocs) or non-oral delivery systems

such as vaginal rings, transdermal patches or gels. they are also
used without e as progestin-only contraceptive agents also named
progestin-only pills (pop).
the effects of progestins are related to interactions not only
with the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) but also with other steroid
hormone receptors. some progestins interact with the androgen
receptor (ar), the  xxxg730xxx  (er), the glucocorticoid
receptor (gr) or the  xxxg1602xxx  (mr). these
interactions may either induce transactivation of a steroid receptor
or prevent activation. in the target organ, the balance between the
receptor coactivators and corepressors recruited by a progestin
determines whether the overall effect of the molecule will be agonistic or antagonistic (liu et al., 2002). all progestins bind to the
pr and have the expected effect on the uterine endometrium, but
each progestin has a distinctive profile of activity in other target
tissues, a profile not necessarily shared by other members of the
same class.
secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation, p has several biological actions. it maintains pregnancy through its antiestrogenic

classification: new versus older progestins
by convention, the older progestins are divided into three generations. these molecules can be classified according to the steroid
from which they derive, p, 17- xxxd2303xxx  or testosterone, which will then determine the molecular structure. (i) the
first generation included norethynodrel and the nortestosterone
derivatives that become active after conversion to  xxxd2751xxx 
(net) (estranes). it also includes the 17- xxxd2303xxx 
derivatives (pregnanes). the second generation included  xxxd2754xxx  and levonorgestrel (lng) (gonanes), and the third generation included the lng derivatives such as  xxxd1849xxx  (dsg), its
active derivative  xxxd2067xxx  (contained in implanon® and
nuvaring®), gestodene (ges) and  xxxd2753xxx  and its active
derivative, norelgestromine (contained in the new transdermal
contraceptive evra®). most of the progestins in the first three generations were derived from testosterone. their structures were
modified to reduce the incidence of undesirable androgenic side
effects but these progestins still bind to the ar, thus making it difficult to eliminate completely some unwanted androgenic side

170

effects. (ii)  xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx ), dienogest (dng), trimegestone
(tmg), nestorone® (nes) and nomegestrol acetate (nomac) are
considered to be ‘new’ progestins, as some have only recently
reached the market and others are still under development (table i).
the new progestins have been designed to bind very specifically to the pr and not to other steroid receptors to avoid androgenic, estrogenic or glucocorticoid side effects (kuhl, 1996a;
stanczyk, 2002; schindler et al., 2003).

pharmacology of the progestins; methods of evaluation
mode of action of the progestins and transactivation of the receptors

the binding affinity of a progestin to the pr does not provide a
complete portrait of steroid hormone activity at the receptor. in
addition to binding to the receptor, the hormone must induce
receptor transactivation to produce the hormonal effect. if the hormone binds to the receptor without allowing the transactivation of
the dna machinery, an antagonistic effect may be produced (liu
et al., 2002).
the progestational action of p, as well as that of the progestins,
is mediated by the pr. in the target cell, p produces a dramatic
change in pr conformation, which is associated with transforming
the pr to an active form that can bind to specific dna elements.
this transformation is accompanied by a loss of associated heat
shock proteins and dimerization. the activated pr dimer, comprised of pr-a and pr-b, then binds to specific dna sequences
within the promotor region of p-responsive genes, referred to as
p-response elements (giangrande and mcdonnell, 1999). the
agonist-bound pr is believed to activate transcription by associating with coactivators, which act as bridging factors between the
receptor and the general transcription machinery. this is followed
by increases in the rate of transcription producing agonist effects
at the cellular and tissue levels (liu et al., 2002).

action, preventing contractions of the uterus; it transforms the
endometrium into a secretory tissue to permit implantation of a
fertilized ovum; and it prevents further ovulation through its antigonadotropic action. in addition, p has an antiandrogenic effect. p
competitively inhibits the action of androgen, as it is a preferred
substrate to the enzyme 5alpha-reductase, hence preventing the conversion of testosterone into its active metabolite dihydrotestosterone (wright et al., 1983). p also interacts with the mr;
competitive binding to this receptor by p prevents its transactivation and inhibits the mineralocorticoid effect. this antagonistic
effect prevents sodium retention and instead induces the excretion
of sodium and water (corvol et al., 1983).
the older progestins, synthesized in the 1960s and 1970s, were
designed for use in contraceptives. for this reason, a major design
target was the antigonadotropic action (henzl and edwards,
2000). the new progestins synthesized in the last two decades
were designed with the objective of creating the ‘ideal’ progestin.
it was hypothesized that a progestin with potent progestational and
antiestrogenic actions on the endometrium coupled with a strong
antigonadotropic effect and without any androgenic or glucocorticoid effects would produce the benefits of p without undesirable
effects, such as acne, a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) or bloating and water retention. in addition,
other beneficial actions of p, such as its antiandrogenic and
antimineralocorticoid effects, were incorporated into the design of
some new progestins (oettel and holz, 2000; elger et al., 2003).
antiandrogenic progestins may have several potentially beneficial
effects, such as reducing endogenous androgen action and
decreasing the incidence of acne or hirsutism.
in addition, when given in the presence of naturally secreted
estradiol (e2) or together with a synthetic e, the final effect of a
progestin on the target organs depends upon the potency of the e.
the potency differences among the es and their varying effects on
the liver, which are determined by their molecular structure as
well as by the mode of delivery, may change the way a specific
progestin, given at a certain dose, affects not only the endometrium
but also the lipid profile, the blood vessels, and, possibly, breast
tissue.

binding to androgen receptors

dng is structurally related to the  xxxd2751xxx  family of testosterone derivatives but acts as an antiandrogen. like the others in
this family, dng has the same 18-carbon nucleus as the estrane
structure (oettel and holz, 2000; teichmann, 2003). dng differs
in structure from  xxxd2751xxx  by having a cyanomethyl group
instead of an ethinyl group at c-17 and by the addition of a double
bond between c-9 and c-10 (oettel and holz, 2000; teichmann,
2003). dng has a high bioavailability (96.2%) and a rather short
terminal half-life (11.6 h) (teichmann, 2003).
the hershberger test evaluating the antiandrogenic effect of
various progestins indicates that dng has about 40% of the
potency of  xxxd1786xxx  (cpa) the most potent antiandrogenic progestin (elger et al., 2003).
when dng is combined with ethinyl-estradiol (ee) (30 mug ee
plus 2 mg dng daily) (valette®), the combination is an effective
combined oral contraceptive (coc; pearl index ∼0.2). this coc
has good bleeding control and improves androgenic symptoms
(foster and wilde, 1998; wiegratz et al., 2002).
wiegratz et al. (2002) studied the effect of four ocs on lipid
metabolism in 100 women randomized to receive either dng in
three different formulations, or a combination of ee and lng. the
changes in lipid metabolism caused by the dng-containing formulations appeared to be more favorable than those observed with ee/
lng due to the difference in androgenicity of the progestin.

 xxxd1946xxx , which is derived from  xxxd3238xxx , is essentially an
antimineralocorticoid progestin (oelkers et al., 1991; pollow et al.,
1992; fuhrmann et al., 1996;, krattenmacher, 2000; elger et al.,
2003). the affinity of  xxxd1946xxx  for the mr is about 5 times the affinity
of aldosterone itself. in addition,  xxxd1946xxx  has some antiandrogenic

progestins may be compared by evaluating their relative binding
affinities (rbas) for the various steroid receptors in comparison
to that of the physiological reference hormones (set at 100%). the
rbas of the new progestins for the er, ar, mr and gr (as compared with e2, testosterone, aldosterone, and cortisol, respectively)
are summarized in table ii. the range of rbas for the new progestins suggests that there are considerable differences in activity
among these molecules. however, the binding affinity to the steroid receptors does not always correlate with the in vivo tests of
estrogenic or androgenic potency.
in a study measuring binding to ar derived from the rat ventral
prostate, the rbas for lng and 3-keto-dsg were 70 and 40%,
respectively, as compared with 100% for t, whereas nes and p
did not show significant binding to the ar (figure 1) (kumar et al.,
2000). although mpa is not derived from testosterone but from
17alpha- xxxd2303xxx , it has an rba for the ar of 36%
(philibert et al., 1999).

in animals are used to compare the biologic activities of the progestins. although these tests are rather old, they are still the gold
standards (kumar et al., 2000) (table iii).
progestational activity is usually evaluated with the mcphail index,
which measures the dose of progestin required to transform the uterine endometrium to a secretory state in immature, e-primed rabbits. a
second assay, the pregnancy maintenance test, measures the progestin
dose required to maintain a pregnancy in ovariectomized female rats.
the third assay, the ovulation inhibition test, measures the progestin
dose required to inhibit spontaneous ovulation in female rats with normal estrus cycles; this assay is used to compare antiovulatory potencies of the progestins (kumar et al., 2000).
the in vivo biological assay of the androgenic activity of a progestin measures the effect of a given dose of progestin on the
weight of the ventral prostate or other male sex organs in immature male rats. antiandrogenic activity is assessed in the same in
vivo model by measuring the dose of progestin required to antagonize the androgenic effect of a fixed dose of testosterone on the
weight of the male sex organs (duc et al., 1995; kumar et al.,
2000; teichmann, 2003). the estrogenic activity of a progestin is
measured by the increase in uterine weight in ovariectomized
immature female rats (kumar et al., 2000).

action; its potency is about 30% of that of cpa, the most potent
antiandrogenic progestin (elger et al., 2003).
 xxxd1946xxx  has the basic 19-carbon chemical structure of its parent
compound, androstane. it has two methylene groups: one is
attached to c-6 and c-7 and the other to c-15 and c-16. in addition, a carbolactone group is attached to c-17 (stanczyk, 2002;
elger et al., 2003)  xxxd1946xxx  has a long terminal half-life (about 32 h)
and its bioavailability is 66%. (stanczyk, 2002).
 xxxd1946xxx , which has pharmacodynamic properties very similar to
p, has been used with ee in a coc (ee 30 mug plus  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg;
tradename: yasmin®) and in an hrt preparation in combination
with oral e2 (e2 1 mg plus  xxxd1946xxx  2 mg; tradename:  xxxd1946xxx ®1).
 xxxd1946xxx  has antimineralocorticoid properties not found in most
synthetic progestins. its antimineralocorticoid activity is one of its
main benefits as it counteracts the effect of the potent oral e, ee,
on  xxxg99xxx  synthesis in the liver, which, in turn, increases
aldosterone, leading to water and salt retention (oelkers et al.,
1991, 1995). because of its antimineralocorticoid activity,  xxxd1946xxx 
has been associated with weight loss, rather than weight gain usually observed in women using coc containing 19-nortestosterone
progestins (oelkers et al., 1995). however, the difference in
weight is minimal and is limited to the first cycles of oc use.
 xxxd1946xxx  and p bind to pr in uterine and mr in kidney cytosol (elger
et al., 2003). with systemic subcutaneous administration of  xxxd1946xxx  in
rats, full endometrial transformation (mcphail index) was obtained at
1 mg/day. at lower  xxxd1946xxx  doses (<1 mg per day), antimineralocorticoid activity was seen in rats with reduction in sodium and water
retention caused by suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system. the latter activity indicated that the potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was
about eight-fold higher than that of  xxxd3238xxx  (elger et al., 2003).
 xxxd1946xxx  also has antiandrogenic activity (elger et al., 2003).
antiandrogenic effects were seen in both gonad-intact and testosterone-substituted castrated male rats. the antiandrogenic
potency of  xxxd1946xxx  is superior to that of  xxxd3238xxx  but inferior to
that of chlormadinone acetate (cma) (elger et al., 2003).
endometrial transformation, inhibition of ovulation and antimineralocorticoid (e.g.. natriuretic) effects and mild antiandrogenic
effects were observed in human subjects at the same range of oral
doses (0.5–4.0 mg per day) (elger et al., 2003).

19-norpregnanes

the 19-norprogesterone derivatives of p (19-norpregnanes) are
referred to as ‘pure’ progestational molecules as they bind more
selectively to the pr. this category includes nomac, an
acetylated compound (paris et al., 1983), as well as four nonacetylated molecules: demegestone, promegestone (also known as
r5020), tmg (a promegestone prodrug) (winneker et al., 2003)
and nes (kumar et al., 2000). the19-norprogesterones are
derived from the pregnane structure but have one less carbon as
they do not have a radical methyl at c-19. although these compounds were synthesized in the early 1980s, two of the three discussed in this review are still in clinical development and may
therefore be called ‘new’ progestins.
tmg

tmg differs from promegestone by the presence of a hydroxylated carbon on the penultimate carbon of the side chain (c-17).
tmg is twice as potent as nes on the mcphail index. however,
on the ovulation inhibition test, tmg is closer in activity to
 xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) (winneker et al., 2003).
the activity of tmg on the rat uterine decidualization and ovulation assays is similar to mpa but the antiestrogenic activity of
tmg evaluated by rat uterine  xxxg282xxx  mrna expression was five times greater than that of mpa (lundeen et al.,
2001).
the rba of tmg for the pr is 588, indicating a high affinity
for the pr but only 42 for the mr (philibert et al., 1999). tmg
has also been demonstrated to have weak antiandrogenic activity
and some antimineralocorticoid activity (zhang et al., 2000;
winneker et al., 2003).
tmg binds to the human pr with an affinity greater than do
mpa,  xxxd2751xxx  (net) or lng. in contrast, tmg binds with
low affinity to the ar, the gr, and the mr and has no measurable
affinity for the er. compared to other progestins, tmg demonstrates an improved separation of its affinity for the pr from its
affinities to other classical steroid hormone receptors. in vivo,
tmg has potent progestin activity. for example, tmg produces
glandular differentiation of the uterine endometrium in rabbits and
is about 30 and 60 times more potent than mpa and net, respectively. in the rat, tmg does not have significant androgenic,

bio activity

new progestins

nes
pharmacological properties of nes

one of the most potent progestins is nes (16-methylene-17alpha-acetoxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione), a 19-norprogesterone derivative. nes’s 19-methyl substitution and the addition of the
16-methylene substituent, which enhances binding to the pr, contribute to the molecule’s high progestational activity (kumar et al.,
2000; stanczyk, 2002).
nes is not active orally but is active at target tissues when
administered continuously through sustained-release implants,
vaginal rings or transdermal systems. this progestin has been
essentially studied for contraceptive purposes.
nes, like p, does not bind to  xxxg2066xxx 
(shbg) and has a shorter half-life and higher clearance rate than
progestins that exhibit shbg binding (fotherby, 1990). the oral
bioavailability of nes is only about 10%, and its half-life is
shorter than that of the progestins that bind to shbg. however, a
much slower elimination rate is observed with the sustainedrelease subdermal nes implant (noe et al., 1993). the lack of
shbg binding and the large volume of distribution is consistent
with the high affinity of nes for pr and its accumulation in
extravascular space (noe et al., 1993). the free fraction of nes
and other progestins, such as p,  xxxd1946xxx  and dng that do not bind to

shbg (oettel et al., 2001), should be greater than most testosteronederived progestins that bind to shbg.
according to the standard in vivo bioassays, nes appears to be
one of the most potent progestins with respect to progestational
and antiovulatory activities. on the mcphail index, nes exhibited
10 times greater potency than lng and was 100 times more
potent than p (figure 2) (kumar et al., 2000; sitruk-ware, 2004).
nes was 100 times more potent when administered s.c. than when
given orally. on the pregnancy maintenance test in ovariectomized rats, nes 0.3 mg was as effective as lng 0.3 mg or p 5
mg in maintaining pregnancy; nes had the highest potency when
the steroids were administered s.c.
using the ovulation inhibition assay in rats with normal estrus
cycles, a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous ovulation was
observed for p, lng and nes when administered s.c. nes was
the most potent of the three, completely inhibiting ovulation at a
daily dose of 10 mug versus lng 20 mug or p 900 mug. (kumar et al.,
2000).
using the in vivo models for the androgenicity, lng and 3-keto-dsg
are androgenic, increasing the weight of the ventral prostate in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas nes and p do not induce such
effects. the weights of the ventral prostate and the levator ani
muscle of immature castrated male rats after nes treatment were
compared to those after treatment either with testosterone, the
control or with 3-keto-dsg or lng. both lng and 3-keto-dsg
produced a dose-dependent weight increase of the ventral prostate.
nes had no androgenic or antiandrogenic activity when administered at a dose of 20 mg–1kg−1day, which far exceeds the effective
dose for contraception in humans. estrogenicity, measured by the
increase in uterine weight, was significantly increased by lng but
not by nes at similar doses. neither progestin was shown to bind
to the er (kumar et al., 2000).
kumar et al. (2003) using the rat uterine  xxxg282xxx 
expression as a model showed that the antiestrogenic activity of
nes was superior to that of dsg or lng.
the glucocorticoid activity of progestins may account for some
of their unwanted effects. mpa, ges and nes have been shown
to bind to the gr. although mpa had glucocorticoid-like effects
at high doses and stimulated  xxxg2250xxx  (tat)
activity (guthrie and john, 1980), nes, even at high doses, did
not show glucocorticoid activity in the in vivo assays in which

glucocorticoid, anti-glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity
but it does have antimineralocorticoid activity and modest
antiandrogenic effects. the overall profile of tmg is qualitatively similar to that of p. when tmg is administered chronically, it antagonizes the effect of e2 on the uterus but does not
antagonize the beneficial bone-sparing activity of e2 (bouali et al.,
2001).
in an experimental model of osteoporosis in ovariectomized
rats, e2, given alone, prevented further bone loss and reduced bone
turnover, as measured by biochemical and histomorphometric
markers. when given with e2, tmg enhanced its beneficial
effects on bone loss and bone turnover (bouali et al., 2001).
in studies in rats, which evaluated central nervous system
(cns) gamma-amino butyric acid (gaba) (a) receptor modulatory activity, tmg had less activity on this undesirable endpoint than did p and  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (neta), which may
translate into fewer mood-related side effects (winneker et al.,
2003).
most of the clinical experience with this progestin has been collected in the treatment of postmenopausal women (grubb et al.,
2003).
in a dose-ranging study evaluating sequential combination
therapy with e2 (2 mg) plus tmg (0.05, 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mg),
given daily, to postmenopausal women, 96% of the endometrial
specimens obtained at study termination had secretory changes
without hyperplasia. in addition, the progestin did not negate the
beneficial effect of e on the lipid profile during treatment, a
finding related to the lack of androgenic activity of tmg (grubb
et al., 2003).
although tmg is one of the most potent progestins of the new
generation, it is not presently developed as a contraceptive. preliminary work using tmg in a transdermal system indicated the
feasibility of such a delivery system (maillard-salin et al., 2000),
but no clinical trials have been published so far.

r.sitruk-ware
increases in liver glycogen and tat were measured. however,
when given in doses 2000 times higher than the dose required to
block ovulation in ovariectomized female rats, nes caused thymus regression (kumar et al., 2000).
nes applications in contraceptive delivery systems

subcutaneous delivery of nes via implants. a single implantreleasing nes alone has been tested in lactating women in a
2-year study comparing the nes implant to the copper t intrauterine device (t-cu) (massai et al., 2001). nes is inactive orally and
thus will not affect the nursing infant. the implant, which is 4 cm
in length and has a silicone drug matrix core containing 80 mg of
nes, initially releases, in vitro, about 100 mug per day. the mean
nes serum levels were 175 pmol/l at one month post-insertion; by
the end of the first year, nes levels had decreased to 60 pmol/l.
no pregnancies occurred in 2195 and 2145 women-months of
exposure to the nes implant and the t-cu, respectively. during
lactation and in the first 6 months of the study, nes implant users
had significantly less irregular bleeding than did the t-cu users
(p < 0.002). implant users exhibited significant increase in irregular bleeding after infant weaning (p < 0.05), similar to that experienced by t-cu users. no serious adverse events that were likely to
be related to nes implant use were observed in either group.
a phase iii should start once the laboratory-scale prototype
implants have been up-scaled in a certified manufacturing site.
transdermal delivery systems for nes. although inactive orally,
nes is particularly well suited for transdermal delivery because it
is highly active when applied to the skin and achieves good systemic bioavailability. preliminary results of clinical trials of a nes
gel indicate that nes is absorbed transdermally and, due to its
high progestational potency and anti-ovulatory effects, can
achieve systemic serum levels that suppress ovulation in most of
the subjects (croxatto and zepeda, 1992; sitruk-ware et al.,
2003). in a 3-month multicenter phase iia study of 150 normal
cycling women, nes gel was applied to abdominal skin in daily
doses of 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg. results showed a clear doseresponse effect in serum nes levels achieved and in ovulation
inhibition: 53, 64 and 83%, respectively. (population council,

nomac. nomac is formed by adding a double bond between c-6
and c-7 of the  xxxd2303xxx  skeleton and deleting the ch3
radical at c-19. these structural changes confer a higher progestational potency to nomac than to mpa (paris et al., 1983; kuhl,
1996a).
in experiments testing the effects of progestins on the prostate
growth, duc et al. (1995) showed no effect of nomac even when
administered at very high doses. nomac has a partial antiandrogenic effect, which is 20 times lower than that of cpa. in similar
experiments, nomac had no androgenic effect (duc et al., 1995).
bazin et al. (1987) showed that oral nomac at a dose of 1.25mg
per day inhibited ovulation while permitting follicle growth, while
doses of 2.5 or 5mg per day suppressed both ovulation and follicle
development. lower doses of nomac were used in contraceptive
implants and were showing efficacy in preventing pregnancy with
one implant used over 1 year (coutinho, 1993; devoto et al.,
1997). new studies will be started with this compound combined
with e2 to develop an oc as announced by organon who recently
acquired the product (organon press release may 31, 2005).

side effects and risks of progestins used in contraception
side effects

most of the side effects attributed to progestins are usually related
to the effects of combined e–progestin products or of high doses
of the older molecules such as depot  xxxd2554xxx 
( xxxd2554xxx ) or lng and net. the effects vary whether the progestin
is associated with e or not, and when the progestin is used alone,
whether the dose is blocking or not the follicular maturation and
the endogenous production of e2. in addition, the side effects may
be related either to the androgenic or to the glucocorticoid properties of a progestin or to its estrogenic effects (sitruk-ware, 2000).
these adverse events are usually reported as headaches, bloating,
mastalgia, weight gain, mood changes and acne, in addition to
bleeding problems (nelson, 1996; erkkola and landgren, 2005).
not all of side effects occur with all of the progestins. acne is usually observed when androgenic molecules are used such as lng at
high doses and headaches are more often observed either due to
hypotrogenism in women receiving high doses of antigonadotropic agents or due to hyperestrogenism in combinations where
the e is predominant. bloating and weight gain are more usually
observed with molecules such as mpa, which at high doses exert
glucocorticoid-like activity, leading to salt and water retention. in
addition, androgenic progestins are stimulating insulin secretion
(wynn et al., 1979), which may be responsible for true weight

vaginal delivery of nes. a nes-only vaginal ring is being
developed as a contraceptive based on the potent antiovulatory
effect of this progestin. in a 6-month study of continuous use in
180 women, vaginal rings delivering 50, 75 or 100 mug per day
were evaluated (brache et al., 2001) nes serum levels remained
fairly constant throughout the study at 125, 200 and 250 pmol/l for
the low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively. luteal activity
was not dose-related and occurred infrequently (in 1.2 to 2.6% of
sampling periods). with the two higher doses, the inhibition of
follicular maturation was more pronounced; e2 levels remained in
the range of 300–400 pmol/l, which is compatible with early follicular phase e levels. all three doses effectively inhibited ovulation,
and luteal activity was suppressed when nes serum levels were
>100 pmol/l. these results indicate the excellent antigonadotropic
effect of nes; nes doses as low as 75 mug/day were sufficient to
suppress ovulation effectively and to prevent follicular growth.
when associated with ee in a 1-year contraceptive vaginal ring,
the combination of 150 mug/day of nes and 15 mug/d of ee showed
a high efficacy on ovulation suppression in a phase 2 study (sivin
et al., 2005). the project is now entering into phase iii.

unpublished data). formulation optimization is ongoing with a
higher concentration of the steroid for further development.
given its pharmacologic profile, the safety and efficacy of nes
delivered transdermally with or without e deserves further
research. studies are ongoing with gels with nes alone or combined with e2 as well as a metered-dose transdermal system
(mtds) that delivers an invisible film on the skin leading to a stable release of nes over 24 h (la guardia et al., 2004).
among the progestins tested for transdermal hormone therapy,
nes and tmg are the most suitable compounds; they rate among
the most potent progestational molecules and have proved to be
active at very low doses.

new progestins
gain. in contrast, the new molecules, which are devoid of androgenic effect or exert anti-androgenic action, may rather treat acne.
decrease in libido may theoretically be attributed to antiandrogenic molecules but this symptom has rarely been reported with
the low doses used in contraceptives. (schneider, 2003) antimineralocorticoid molecules such as  xxxd1946xxx  would rather induce salt
and water elimination and prevent the small weight gain associated with water retention (oelkers et al., 1995).
progestins and venous risk

progestins and the breast

the role of progestins on the breast cells has been controversial
since the past three decades. the action of the progestins on the
breast cells differ according to the molecule, dose and duration of
use and the resulting balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis (desreux et al., 2003; sitruk-ware and plu-bureau, 2004).
however, progestins are usually combined with ee in hormonal
contraceptives and the final results depend on the balance of
effects on the breast tissue.
it has been demonstrated that breast cells in the late phase of
cell cycle activity are initially driven to the s phase of dna synthesis by progestins (musgrove et al., 1991). this effect is transient

the major risks attributed to hormonal contraceptives have been
focused on the risk of venous thromboembolism (vte) and cardiovascular disease although the occurrence of such events is very
rare in the young population of women using contraceptives.
the increased risk of vte with use of ocs is well known. in all
large studies conducted since 1995, the odds ratio (or) of vte is
about four for any oc use (farley et al., 1999). in the early 1990s,
the risk of vte was associated with the dose of ee. the vte risk
for use of an oc with a third-generation progestin was found to be
about twice that for use of an oc with second-generation progestins. in a recent meta-analysis (kemmeren et al., 2001), a relative risk of vte of 1.7 was established for use of ocs with thirdgeneration progestins versus second-generation progestins. the
difference of effects observed between second and third generation oc may be related for some of the variables to the difference
in the androgenic properties of the progestin. third-generation
progestins are less androgenic than second-generation compounds,
and this difference is reflected on the changes in shbg and hdl
(odlind et al., 2002).
although there is no marker for vte risk, epidemiological
studies document that second-generation ocs carry lower risks
than do third generation ocs. shbg has been proposed as a possible marker of the venous risk (odlind et al., 2002). the authors
correlated the percentage of increase in shbg with the observational data on vte published for various categories of ocs, the
higher the estrogenicity as indicated by shbg levels, the higher
the risk of vte. however, the observational data cannot be used
to extrapolate changes from a given protein as a surrogate marker
to the risk of vte.
ocs containing ee generally increase the synthesis of shbg,
but the progestogen component modifies this effect (odlind et al.,
2002). an oc containing the androgenic progestogen lng is not
associated with a high increase in shbg, while other progestagens, such as dsg, ges (ges), or cpa, which are less androgenic or antiandrogenic, are associated with a higher shbg
increase as they do not oppose the estrogenic effect. the dose of
ee influences the rise in shbg, but the progestogen component
modulates the dose response.
in the euras post-marketing surveillance study (heinemann
and dinger, 2004) comparing a new oc containing an antiandrogenic progestin,  xxxd1946xxx  that does not oppose the ee-related
increase in shbg, with other second or third generation of ocs
on the incidence of vte no differences in relative risk of vte
were observed. this observation is of interest as the magnitude of
changes in shbg was significantly different between the new oc
and a lng containing oc.
ee impacts strongly on the liver proteins whether delivered
parenterally or orally. the assumption that non-oral delivery

would avoid the first pass effect on the liver appears to be true for
e2 but not for ee, which has a long half-life and is not metabolized readily (goebelsmann et al., 1985). it has been previously
shown that ee given vaginally would stimulate corticosteroidbinding globulin (cbg) and shbg as well as oral ee (goebelsmann
et al., 1985). therefore, the same cautions and contraindications
that apply to ocs are likely to apply to any system containing ee
and new progestins with non-androgenic properties would not
oppose this effect of ee.
the influence of progestins on hemostasis parameters depends
on type and dose of the association with that of an e, the route of
administration and the duration of its application (kuhl, 1996b).
when used with ethinyl-estradiol (ee), several combinations of e
and progestins lead to an acceleration of coagulation and fibrinolysis (wiegratz et al., 2004). this is primarily induced by the
hepatic impact of ee. wiegratz et al. (2004) showed an antagonistic effect of lng on the ee-induced rise on some coagulation and
inflammation markers such as  xxxg750xxx  activity and fragment
1 + 2 and on the ee-dependent reduction of total and free protein
s but not with dng, an antiandrogenic progestin. therefore, progestogens with androgenic properties may counteract the
e-induced changes in the hepatic synthesis of platelet aggregation
and readiness for coagulation while non-androgenic progestins
would not (kuhl, 1996a; wiegratz et al., 2004; rad et al., 2005).
progestogen-only pills cause only minor effects on coagulation
and fibrinolysis (kuhl, 1996b). in combinations of ee and new
progestins, the studies of clotting factors and liver proteins show a
profile similar to the third-generation contraceptives (magnusdottir
et al., 2004; rad et al., 2005).
very few epidemiological studies have considered the risk of
progestins given alone for contraception, without e. in a retrospective case–control study, conard et al. (2004) studied women
at high risk of vte who received cma for contraceptive purpose
(cma is a pregnane derivative from the second-generation of progestins). they found no increase in risk in cma users as compared to controls with a relative risk of vte at 0.8 (95%
confidence interval = 0.2–3.9). further studies with the new progestins used alone are warranted.
with associations of new progestins and e2, the effect on clotting factors should theoretically be neutral, but data has yet to
come. the future should bring new combinations of hormonal
contraceptives using e2 instead of ee and the use of non-androgenic
progestins with potent antigonadotropic properties will ensure the
contraceptive effect with a better tolerability profile and less
impact on the liver metabolism than with ee.

r.sitruk-ware

conclusion
in conclusion, the progestins available for contraception are not
similar. there may be profound differences among these molecules according to their structure, metabolites and pharmacodynamic actions. it is therefore inappropriate to consider the various
effects of the older and newer progestins as class effects.

176

the new progestins developed for contraceptives and hrt regimens have been designed to be closer in structure and function to
the natural hormone p. their design suggests that their use should
not be accompanied by adverse effects on the surrogate markers of
cardiovascular risk. preliminary data on the new progestins from
pharmacologic studies supports the potential of these agents to be
generally well tolerated, but their final effect will depend upon the
type and dose of the associated estrogen.

and further application of progestins suppresses the cyclins, halting breast cell division in early g1 phase. in addition, the normal
cell cycle in breast cells can be shifted from cell division to cell
differentiation under the action of p as has been shown in a study
with mcf-7 human breast cells in which progestin-induced
growth inhibition was due to cell differentiation rather than to
apoptosis (alkhalaf et al., 2002).
in a recent study conducted in surgically postmenopausal
cynomolgus monkeys  xxxd2044xxx  (cee) plus
mpa induced a diffuse epithelial proliferation in the mammary
glands but ee plus neta did not (suparto et al., 2003). in
another study using fine needle biopsy specimens from mammary
glands of women using e2 (2 mg) or  xxxd2040xxx  (ev) 2 mg
plus neta (1 mg) or dng (2 mg), (conner et al., 2003) ki67,
used as a proliferation marker, did not differ significantly between
neta or dng although the dng group showed a tendency for a
weaker proliferation.
in addition, previous in vitro studies in mcf-7 or t47d breast
cell lines have compared the effects of several progestins on cell
proliferation (catherino et al., 1993; catherino and jordan, 1995).
in these studies, nomac, as well as mpa, did not induce proliferation while ges and lng did promote proliferation. whether the
in vitro data can be extrapolated to a clinical setting has long been
debated. only a long-term randomized controlled trial could provide definite proof that various progestins act differently on the
risk of breast cancer. however, using the available tools, under the
same experimental conditions, not all progestins have the same
effects on breast cells.
epidemiological studies have raised controversies as to the role
of progestins used in hrt for the risk of breast cancer (million
women study collaborators, 2003; sitruk-ware and plu-bureau,
2004; dietel et al., 2005). the million women study suggested
that users of several of the older progestins used in hrt would
increase the risk of breast cancer within the first 2 years of treatment. one of the most recent observational studies showed differences in risk according to the categories of progestins used in hrt
and no risk was found for users of  xxxd3023xxx  (fournier
et al., 2005). dietel et al. (2005) studying the pathobiological
aspect of hormone-sensitive breast cancers indicated that the long
developmental process of tumors is in apparent contradiction to
results of some epidemiological studies that showed increased
cancer risk, implying primary initiation in hrt users within
observation periods of 1–6 years. this indicates that great caution
should be exercised when interpreting epidemiological studies.
whether the use of hormonal contraceptives increases the risk of
breast cancer later in life, when the incidence of breast cancer is
increased has been largely studied. in the most recent populationbased, case–control study, current or former oral-contraceptive
use was not associated with a significantly increased risk of breast
cancer (marchbanks et al., 2002). the role of new combinations is
still unknown and further studies are warranted.
