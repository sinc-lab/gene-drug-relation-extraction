occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors by clozapine
in the primate brain: a pet study
received: 2 may 2002 / accepted: 22 august 2002 / published online: 13 february 2003
 springer-verlag 2003

abstract rationale: the pharmacological mechanism
underlying the atypical properties of the antipsychotic
drug clozapine remains to be identified. the serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine-1a (5-ht1a) receptor subtype has
been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia and is one among several central neuroreceptors for which clozapine has moderate affinity in vitro.
objective: the aim of this positron emission tomography
(pet) study was to determine  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy
in the monkey brain after iv injection of clozapine in
doses that previously have been shown to give plasma
concentrations representative of the 200 to 800 mg oral
dose range recommended for clinical management of
patients. methods: each of four cynomolgus monkeys was
examined three times on the same day with pet and the
radioligand [carbonyl-11c]way-100635. the first measurement was performed at baseline conditions, the
second after clozapine 1.5 mg/kg and the third after
6 mg/kg. two additional monkeys were examined at
baseline and after 15 mg/kg iv. central  xxxg1108xxx 
occupancy was calculated using an equilibrium-ratio
analysis. results: the occupancy ranged from 23 to
34% after 1.5 mg/kg clozapine and from 36 to 49% after
6 mg/kg in different brain regions of the four monkeys.

were between 39 and 51% in the two monkeys. there was
no evident difference between the frontal cortex, the
temporal cortex and the raphe nucleus. conclusion: the
study shows that clozapine occupies 5-ht1a receptors in
the primate brain at clinically representative plasma
concentrations. the results support that the 5-ht1a
receptor is a candidate target for the atypical drug actions
of clozapine.

introduction
clozapine has been termed an atypical antipsychotic drug
because the drug is effective in many patients refractory
to conventional antipsychotic drugs and does not produce
significant extrapyramidal side effects (kane et al. 1988;
lindstrom 1988; baldessarini and frankenburg 1991;
casey 1997). however, despite extensive research, the
pharmacological mechanism underlying the atypical
properties of clozapine remains to be identified.
the clinical efficacy of conventional antipsychotic
agents has been generally attributed to their ability to
block d2 dopamine receptors in the brain. this hypothesis
has been further supported by the finding that antipsychotic drugs have common affinity for d2 dopamine
receptors in vitro (seeman et al. 1976) and by the reported
high occupancy (70–90%) of d2 dopamine receptors
demonstrated by positron emission tomography (pet) in
patients with schizophrenia (farde et al. 1992). however,
in contrast to classical neuroleptics, clozapine is a weak
antagonist at the d2 dopamine receptor (millan et al.
1995) and the d2 dopamine receptor occupancy is low
(20–67%) in treated patients (farde et al. 1989b; nordstrom et al. 1995). these observations suggest that
binding to other neuroreceptors apart from the d2
dopamine receptor may explain the mode of action of
clozapine.

235

the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1a (5-ht1a) receptor is one
among several central neuroreceptors for which clozapine
has moderate affinity (ki=160 nm) (mason and reynolds
1992; newman-tancredi et al. 1996). presynaptic 5-ht1a
receptors mediate inhibition of 5-ht release and are
highly concentrated on cell bodies in the raphe nuclei
(romero et al. 1994). this autoreceptor has been given a
key role in current hypotheses on the drug treatment of
anxiety and depression (baldwin and rudge 1995;
berendsen 1995). the postsynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  in
the neocortex is of particular interest in schizophrenia
research because several laboratories have demonstrated
elevated  xxxg1108xxx  binding in the neocortex post
mortem (hashimoto et al. 1993; joyce et al. 1993;
sumiyoshi et al. 1996) and by pet in vivo (tauscher et
al. 2002).
studies on the relationship between plasma clozapine
concentration and clinical efficacy have suggested that
most patients respond at a plasma clozapine concentration
above 350 ng/ml (hasegawa et al. 1993; kronig et al.
1995; spina et al. 2000), whereas other studies support
that some patients may respond at a lower level (nordstrom et al. 1995). in a recent pet study, 1.5 mg/kg
clozapine was administered iv to cynomolgus monkeys
(nyberg et al. 2002). the plasma clozapine concentration
was between 104 and 194 ng/ml at a d2 dopamine
receptor occupancy of 57 to 59% (nyberg et al. 2002).
importantly, the plasma concentration and d2 dopamine
receptor occupancy values were close to those reported
previously in clozapine treated patients (nordstrom et al.
1995). the dose of 1.5 mg/kg clozapine iv should thus
provide a clinically representative plasma concentration
level for the study of clozapine binding to 5-ht1a
receptors in the primate brain.
the aim of this pet study was to determine if
clozapine occupies 5-ht1a receptors in the primate brain
in vivo. central  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was determined using pet and the radioligand [carbonyl11
c]way-100635 in six cynomolgus monkeys. to test
the hypothesis conclusively, not only 1.5 mg/kg but also
higher doses of 6 and 15 mg/kg were used.

materials and methods
the study was performed at the department of clinical neuroscience at the karolinska institute after approval from the animal
ethics committee of northern stockholm, sweden. principles of
laboratory animal care were followed according to nih publication
no.85-23, revised 1985.

radiochemistry
[carbonyl-11c]way-100635 was prepared by 11c-acylation of the
precursor way-100634 with [carbonyl-11c]cyclohexanecarbonyl
chloride as previously described in detail (pike et al. 1996; hall et
al. 1997). the specific radioactivity was about 2000 ci/mmol
(74 gbq/mol) at end of synthesis. the specific radioactivity (sr)
was 500 to 1800 ci/mmol at time of intravenous administration.
the radiochemical purity was higher than 99%.
pet system
radioactivity in brain was measured with the siemens ecat exact
hr47 system which was used in the three-dimensional mode
(wienhard et al. 1994). the system covers an axial distance of
15 cm. the transaxial resolution of the reconstructed images is
about 3.8 mm full width at half-maximum (fwhm) and the axial
resolution 4.0 mm fwhm. transmission scans were acquired with
three rotating 68ge-68ga sources and used to correct the emission
scans for the attenuation of 511 kev photon rays through tissue and
head support.
pet studies on monkeys
six cynomolgus monkeys (a to f) weighing 3–5 kg were obtained
from the swedish institute of infectious disease control, solna,
sweden. anesthesia was induced by repeated intramuscular
injection of a 2:3 mixture of ketamine (ketalar; 1–2 mg/kg per
hour) and xylazin (rompun; 1 mg/k per hour). a head fixation
system was used to secure a fixed and reproducible position of the
monkey head during the pet measurement (karlsson et al. 1993).
the positioning of the imaging planes was parallel to the
canthomeatal line. body temperature was controlled and fixed at
37c by a heating pad with thermostat. radioactivity in brain was
measured for 93 min after iv injection of radioligand.
in each of four monkeys (a to d) a baseline pet measurement
was performed in the morning. a sterile physiological phosphate
buffer (ph=7.4) solution containing about 1.4 mci (50 mbq) of
[carbonyl-11c]way-100635 was injected as a bolus into a sural
vein during 2 s. the pet measurements were repeated on the same
day 30 min after iv administration of clozapine 1.5 mg/kg and
6 mg/kg, respectively.
two additional monkeys (e and f) were examined twice on the
same day. the first measurement was at baseline conditions and the
second was 30 min after iv injection of clozapine in the high dose
of 15 mg/kg.
clozapine concentrations in plasma
for determination of clozapine plasma levels, venous blood
samples (2 ml) were obtained from the femoral vein at 30 min
after start of the pet measurement by using lithium heparin
monovettes. the samples were centrifuged and the serum was kept
frozen until analysis. plasma clozapine concentration was determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with single ion
detection (bondesson and lindstrom 1988).
regions of interest (rois)

compounds
clozapine was purchased from sigma ltd, sweden. the solution of
clozapine was prepared as an intravenous stock solution batch
according to good laboratory practice routines. the radioligand
precursor way-100634 was obtained as a gift from wyett
research ltd (uk).

for analysis of regional brain radioactivity, regions of interest
(rois) were drawn on the summation pet images which represent
radioactivity measured between 9 and 93 min. rois were drawn for
the frontal cortex, the temporal cortex, the raphe nucleus and the
cerebellum. the anatomical delineation of regions was guided by
an atlas showing a series of horizontal sections of a cynomolgus
monkey brain in situ obtained by serial cryomicrotomy (karlsson et
al. 1993). regional radioactivity (nci/ml) was measured for each
sequential time frame, corrected for 11c-decay and plotted versus

236
time. data were pooled for regions that appear in both brain
hemispheres.
calculation of  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy
by the ratio method
the pet system measures the total radioactivity concentration in a
region of interest (croi). assuming negligible specific binding in
the cerebellum, the region can be used as reference for free and
non-specific binding (cn) in brain (farde et al. 1989a, 1998). the
time curve for specific binding, cb(t), of [carbonyl-11c]way100635 was defined as:
cb ðtþ ¼ croi ðtþ  cn ðtþ

receptor occupancy (%) was defined as the percent reduction of r
after administration of clozapine when compared with r at
baseline.
following an intravenous bolus injection of ligand, the
relationship between receptor binding and the concentration of
ligand at equilibrium is given by a hyperbolic (curvilinear)
function, derived from the law of mass action (farde et al.
1989a; ito et al. 1998).

the  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy induced by pretreatment with

described previously for other radioligands (farde et al. 1992,
1997). in brief, the curves for cb(t) and cn(t) were integrated for the
interval from 33 to 63 min after [carbonyl-11c]way-100635 iv
injection. the integration period include time of peak equilibrium
(farde et al. 1989a, 1997). the ratio (r) of regional specific
binding [cb(t)] to the cerebellum (cn(t)) was then calculated for all

apparent equilibrium dissociation constant and f is the concentration of free (unbound) ligand.
equation (3) was used to describe the relationship between the
plasma concentration of clozapine and receptor occupancy (karlsson et al. 1995; farde et al. 2000). the calculation is based on the
assumptions that there is a linear relationship between dose and
plasma concentration and the unbound plasma fraction of the drug
is constant. given these assumptions, f may be substituted with the
drug concentration and equation (3) can be rewritten as:

ð3þ

ð4þ

where occmax is the maximal occupancy that can be induced by
clozapine and [drug]pl is the plasma clozapine concentration.
in the present study,  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was plotted
versus the corresponding clozapine drug concentration in plasma.
each data point was treated as a separate observation, and equation
(4) was fitted to the experimental data using an iterative procedure
where occmax and kapp
d were varied to minimize the sum of squared
differences between fitted and experiment values. the fitting
procedure was executed using the program kaleidagraph implemented on an ibm personal computer.

results
during the baseline pet measurement, there was a
marked accumulation of radioactivity in the frontal
cortex, the temporal cortex and the raphe nucleus,
whereas the radioactivity in the cerebellum was low
(fig. 1).
after pretreatment with clozapine, the radioactivity
was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in all regions,
whereas there was no evident effect of clozapine on the

time radioactivity curves for the cerebellum (fig. 2). the
 xxxg1108xxx  occupancy ranged from 23 to 34% after
1.5 mg/kg clozapine iv and from 36 to 49% after 6 mg/kg
clozapine iv (table 1). in the two additional monkeys,
pretreated with 15 mg/kg, the calculated regional 5-ht1a
receptor occupancy was between 39 and 51%. there was
no evident difference between the occupancy values for
the regions examined. the clozapine plasma concentrations at time of the pet measurement are given in table 1.
the relationship between plasma concentration and  xxxg1108xxx  receptor occupancy could be described by a
hyperbolic function (eqn 4). the calculated maximal
reduction of [carbonyl-11c]way-100635 binding was
about 50% (fig. 3).

discussion
the atypical antipsychotic clozapine binds to cloned
human 5-ht1a receptors in vitro with an affinity of
160 nm (ki) (newman-tancredi et al. 1996). in the
present study, pet and the selective radioligand [carbonyl-11c]way-100635 were used to evaluate the occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors by clozapine in the primate brain
in vivo. the binding on the frontal cortex, the temporal
cortex and the raphe nucleus but not the cerebellum was
reduced in a dose-dependent manner after pretreatment
with clozapine (figs 1 and 2), the reduction of [carbonyl11
c]way-100635 binding indicates that clozapine indeed
occupies central 5-ht1a receptors in the primate brain in
vivo.
the plasma concentrations after 1.5 and 6.0 mg/kg
clozapine iv were between 149 and 682 ng/ml (table 1)
and similar to those reported in a previous monkey study
from our laboratory (nyberg et al. 2002). in clozapine
treated patients it has been show that a daily oral dose

range of 125–600 mg clozapine corresponds to plasma
concentrations of 76–930 ng/ml (nordstrom et al. 1995).
another study reported that most patients respond at a
plasma clozapine concentration above 350 ng/ml (hasegawa et al. 1993; kronig et al. 1995; spina et al. 2000).
the plasma concentration range measured after clozapine
1.5 and 6.0 mg/kg iv is thus similar to the plasma
concentration ranges reported in patients responding to
clinical treatment with clozapine. the  xxxg1108xxx 
occupancy observed in the present study should accordingly be expected also in patients responding to clozapine
treatment.
a minimal d2 dopamine receptor occupancy of about
70% has been suggested for the antipsychotic effect of
classical antipsychotics (farde et al. 1992; kapur et al.
2000). the low d2 dopamine receptor occupancy range in
clozapine treated patients may suggest that the pharmacological effect of clozapine is mediated by receptors
other than the d2 subtype (farde et al. 1989b, 1992). the
present study shows that clozapine binds to the 5-ht1a
receptor in the primate brain. however, there are at
present no data on the relationship between pharmacological effects and degree of 5-ht1a occupancy in
humans. it is thus not possible to conclude a pharmacological significance of  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy in
relation to clozapine treatment.
it has been suggested that clozapine is a partial agonist
at cloned human 5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et
al. 1996). the relationship between clozapine iv dosage
and receptor occupancy was described by a saturation
hyperbola giving a maximal  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy
of 50% (fig. 3). in other words, even if plasma clozapine
concentrations reached a very high level, it was not
possible to induce  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy higher than
about 50%. it has been proposed that g-protein coupled
receptors may exist in high and low affinity states.
antagonist such as way-100635 binds with the same
affinity to the two states, whereas agonist such as
endogenous serotonin binds with different affinity to the
two states (de lean et al. 1980; chou et al. 1999).
clozapine is a partial agonist for 5-ht1a receptors
(newman-tancredi et al. 1996) and may thus bind
preferentially to the sub-population of 5-ht1a receptors
that are in the high affinity states. this hypothesis may
provide an interpretation of the present finding of 50%
maximal  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy. interestingly, a
similar reasoning can also explain a recent pet study
showing a plateau effect of endogenous d2 dopamine
receptor occupancy after amphetamine induced dopamine
release (mukherjee et al. 1997).
one of the atypical profiles of clozapine is less
extrapyramidal symptoms, such as dystonia, akathesia
and tardive dyskinesa. several experimental studies have
reported a beneficial effect of  xxxg1108xxx  agonists in
reversing and preventing the development of catalepsy in
rodents (invernizzi et al. 1988; hicks 1990; neal-beliveau et al. 1993). this effect has been further confirmed in
a primate model of extrapyramidal symptoms (liebman
et al. 1989) and may represent an action on somatoden-

239

dritic autoreceptors in the raphe. an effect of clozapine on
 xxxg1108xxx  mediated function could thus contribute
to the very low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in
clozapine treated patients with schizophrenia. however,
the effects of selective 5-ht1a agonists or antagonists
have to our knowledge not been examined in patients with
schizophrenia.
the results of the present study in monkeys indicate
that clozapine occupies 5-ht1a receptors in the primate
brain. the 20–50%  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy at clinically relevant doses is similar to the 20–67% d2
dopamine receptor occupancy previously reported in
clozapine treated patients (farde et al. 1992; nordstrom
et al. 1995) and monkeys (nyberg et al. 2002). we
suggest that the  xxxg1108xxx  is a candidate target for
the atypical drug actions of clozapine.
