 xxxd414xxx , a fully-human mab against  xxxg1170xxx  for the potential treatment of inflammatory disorders.  novartis ag is developing  xxxd414xxx , an intravenously or subcutaneously infused, fully human mab that neutralizes the bioactivity of human  xxxg1170xxx , which is involved in several inflammatory disorders.  xxxd414xxx  has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of  xxxg1567xxx -associated periodic syndromes (caps) and possibly for other complex inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sojia), copd disease and ocular diseases. currently in phase iii clinical development,  xxxd414xxx  was recently granted eu and us orphan drug status for sojia and caps. early clinical trials have established the administration of  xxxd414xxx  every 2 weeks to be safe and effective, offering a considerable advantage over the existing treatment with the human  xxxd2806xxx  anakinra, which must be injected daily and which is often poorly tolerated by patients. the availability of more than one il-1 targeting biological agent is undoubtedly advantageous, not only for patients and clinicians, but also for the elucidation of disease mechanisms.
