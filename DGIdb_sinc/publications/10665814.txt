abstract
the voltage gated calcium channel family is a major target for a range of therapeutic drugs.  xxxd2638xxx  (ro 40–5967) belongs
to a new chemical class of these molecules which differs from other ca2+ antagonists by its ability to potently block t-type ca2+
channels. however, this molecule has also been shown to inhibit other ca2+ channel subtypes. to further analyze the mechanism
governing the ca2+ channel– xxxd2638xxx  interaction, we examined the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on various recombinant ca2+ channels
expressed in mammalian cells from their cloned cdnas, using ca2+ as the permeant ion at physiological concentration. expression
of alpha1a, alpha1c and alpha1e in tsa 201 cells resulted in ca2+ currents with functional characteristics closely related to those of their native
counterparts.  xxxd2638xxx  blocked alpha1a and alpha1e with a kd comparable to that reported for t-type channels, but had a lower affinity
(苲30-fold) for alpha1c. for each channel, inhibition by  xxxd2638xxx  was consistent with high-affinity binding to the inactivated state.
modulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation properties by the nature of the coexpressed  xxxg217xxx  or the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  splice variant
altered block at the  xxxd2638xxx  receptor site. therefore, we conclude that the tissue and sub-cellular localization of calcium channel
subunits as well as their specific associations are essential parameters to understand the in vivo effects of  xxxd2638xxx .  1999

1. introduction
voltage-gated calcium channels (vgccs), are transmembrane proteins involved in the regulation of cellular
excitability and ca2+ homeostasis. vgccs, classified as
l-, n-, p-, q-, r- and t-type based on their functional
properties, are critical for many cellular functions
including muscular contraction, neurotransmitter release
and excitability. to date, ten ca2+ channels genes have
been reported and termed alpha1s for the first one identified
in skeletal muscle and alpha1a through to alpha1i for the nine
others isolated subsequently (perez-reyes et al., 1998).
when transiently expressed from their cdna in a host

system together with their ancillary beta and alpha2delta subunits,
alpha1a exhibits the characteristics of p- and q-type channels, alpha1b encodes an n-type channel, alpha1c alpha1d and alpha1s
constitute three different types of l-type channels, and
alpha1e seems to correlate to resistant r-type channels
defined as vgccs insensitive to all known ca channel
antagonists and toxins. the recently described alpha1f gene
is highly homologous to alpha1d and probably corresponds
to an l-type channel (fisher et al., 1997). finally, alpha1g
alpha1h and alpha1i the latest genes identified, have been unambiguously characterized as members of the t-type ca
channel family (perez-reyes et al., 1998; cribbs et al.,
1998; lee et al., 1999).
vgccs are major targets for a variety of therapeutic
agents such as dihydropyridines (dhps), benzothiazepines (btzs), and phenylalkylamines (ppas) that are used
in the treatment of hypertension, stroke, acute ischemia,
migraine and epilepsy. these drugs are considered as l-

type ca2+ channel antagonists. in addition to the dhps,
btzs and paas, a new molecule ( xxxd2638xxx , a tetralole
derivative) has been described with a potent action on
low-voltage activated t-type vgccs (mishra and
hermsmeyer, 1994).  xxxd2638xxx  has proven to be effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases but the
relationship between the clinical effect (hypotension
with no increase in heart rate) and the inhibition of ttype channels has not clearly been established. in
addition to the block of t-type ca2+ channels,  xxxd2638xxx 
was also reported to block channels induced by alpha1a, alpha1b,
alpha1c and alpha1e expression in xenopus oocytes
(bezprozvanny and tsien, 1995). to further compare
 xxxd2638xxx  blockade of different calcium channel subtypes, we studied its action on three major classes of
cloned ca2+ channels. our results provide the first comparison of the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on recombinant alpha1a,
alpha1c, alpha1e currents in nearly physiological conditions
(transiently expressed in mammalian cells and currents
recorded in physiological levels of external calcium). in
addition, our results show that the voltage-dependent
kinetics of inactivation of ca2+ channels, determined by
the nature of the associated  xxxg217xxx  isoform and/or
alternative splicing of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  gene, is critical for the
action of  xxxd2638xxx .

2. materials and methods
2.1. transient expression of recombinant calcium
channels
cdnas encoding vgccs  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx  and beta subunits and
reporter genes (cd8 or gfp) were inserted in vertebrate
expression vectors. rat brain alpha1a isoforms, alpha1e, beta2a, and
alpha2delta were cloned in pmt2 (stea et al., 1994; soong et
al., 1993; bourinet et al., 1999); rat brain alpha1c and beta1b,
in pcep4 (tomlinson et al., 1993); and cd8 (generously
provided by dr brian seed, massachusetts general
hospital) and gfp (a kind gift from dr kye chesnut,
university of florida) in cmv promoter driven vectors.
human embryonic kidney cells expressing the sv40
large antigen (tsa201 cells) were obtained from dr richard horn (jefferson medical college). they were grown
in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v). for optimal
transfection, cells were plated at 30–40% confluence on
glass coverslips coated with poly- xxxd2793xxx . a calcium
phosphate transfection procedure was used with an alpha1alpha2delta-beta-cd8 or gfp cdna mix at a molar ration of
1:1:1:0.1. after an incubation of at least 48 hours, positively transfected cells were identified either with anticd8 antibody coated beads (when cd8 was
cotransfected), or using an epifluorescence illumination
source on the microscope (when gfp was
cotransfected). for xenopus oocyte transient expression,

stage v and vi oocytes were prepared as described
(bourinet et al., 1996), and nuclear injection was performed with 10 nl of an  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -alpha2delta-beta cdna mix (1:1:1 molar
ratio). oocytes were then incubated at 18°c for three to
six days in nd96 medium.
2.2. electrophysiology
positively transfected tsa201 cells were analyzed by
whole-cell patch clamp using either a biologic rk300
or an axopatch 200a amplifier. leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using a p/5 method. except where
indicated in the text, currents were evoked with 50 ms
long depolarizing pulses from ⫺100 mv to the potential
giving the maximum inward current delivered at 0.1 hz.
extracellular solution contained (in mm): 2 cacl2, 160
teacl, 10 hepes (ph to 7.4 with teaoh). pipettes
of typical resistance of 1–2 m⍀, made of borosilicate
glass, were filled with an internal solution containing (in
mm): 110 cscl, 3 mgcl2, 10 egta, 10 hepes, 3 mgatp, 0.6 gtp (ph to 7.2 with csoh).  xxxd2638xxx  (a gift
from dr robert koen, produits roche) was prepared
daily in the external solution  xxxd1891xxx  mm. the various
dilutions were applied to cells by gravity driven perfusion controlled by solenoid valves.
macroscopic oocyte currents were recorded using two
electrode voltage-clamp as described (bourinet et al.,
1996) in a solution containing (in mm): 5 baoh2, 25
teaoh, 25 naoh, 2 csoh, 30 nmdg, 5 hepes (ph
to 7.3 with  xxxd390xxx  acid). the endogenous
oocyte ca2+-activated cl⫺ current was completely suppressed by injection of a bapta solution (2–5 mm estimated final concentration). on line leak subtracted currents were evoked at 0.1 hz by 100 ms long depolarizing
pulses from ⫺80 to 0 mv. oocytes were continuously
perfused and  xxxd2638xxx  dilutions were applied by a perfusion system controlled by solenoid valves.
pclamp6 software was used for data acquisition and
analysis. current-voltage curves were fitted using a
modified boltzmann equation as described (bourinet et
al., 1996). inactivation curves were constructed by normalizing the current after a 15 sec conditioning prepulse
and then fitted to a boltzmann equation. apparent dissociation constants (kd) were obtained from the fits of
the  xxxd2638xxx  dose-response curves using a sigmoidal
function. results are presented as the mean±sem.

3. results
3.1. recombinant ca2+ currents in mammalian cells
transfection of rat alpha1a, alpha1c, or alpha1e with  xxxg831xxx -delta and beta1b
subunits produced a robust expression of ca2+ channels
as determined by the presence of a large ca2+ current density. this allowed the comparison of these three major

types of vgccs with a physiological concentration of
ca2+ as the charge carrier. the alpha1a alpha1c and alpha1e channels
were activated by depolarization greater than ⫺40 to ⫺30
mv, had a maximum amplitude around 0 mv, and
reversed near +60 mv (fig. 1). they all deactivated with
monoexponential decay kinetics which was best fitted
with a time constant of less than 1 ms (in the range of
0.2 to 0.5 ms, data not shown). as expected from previous
work (deleon et al., 1995; bourinet et al., 1996), comparison of current kinetics using either ca2+ or ba2+ as
the charge carrier showed that, unlike alpha1a and alpha1e, the
recombinant alpha1c l-type currents displayed marked ca2+dependent inactivation comparable to that observed for
native l-type currents (data not shown).
3.2. dose-dependence of  xxxd2638xxx  block
we studied the antagonistic effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on
the ca2+ currents generated by alpha1a, alpha1c, and alpha1e. the
dose-response curves in fig. 2a show that the alpha1a and
alpha1e channels were blocked in the sub-micromolar concentration range (apparent kd of 0.3 and 0.4 µm
respectively), while at least a 10 fold higher concen-

3

tration was required to produce an equivalent block of
the alphalc channels (apparent kd of 12 µm). all three doseresponse curves were best fitted with a hill number of
1; consistent with a 1 to 1  xxxd2638xxx  to ca2+ channel
interaction. comparison of the current traces obtained
before and after the steady state effect of 1 µm  xxxd2638xxx  is reached, further illustrates this difference in sensitivity (fig. 2b). more than 75% of the alpha1a and alpha1e currents were blocked while the alpha1c current was almost
unaffected.
3.3. voltage-dependent block
 xxxd2638xxx  block of all high-voltage-activated ca2+
channel subtypes has previously been suggested to be
strongly dependent on the resting membrane potential
(bezprozvanny and tsien, 1995; but see also aczél et
al., 1998). therefore, we tested whether or not this also
occurred in our experimental conditions. ca2+ currents
were evoked from a holding potential (hp) of either
⫺100 mv or ⫺60 mv. fig. 3 shows the significant leftward shift in the dose response-curves without modification of the slope observed when the hp was switched

⫺7.4 and ⫺5.1 (alpha1e); ⫺12.3 and ⫺7.3 (alpha1c).

beta1b; open triangle: alpha1c  xxxg831xxx  beta1b). the results indicates that alpha1a and alpha1e channels are more potently blocked than alpha1c. the data are well described
by a hill coefficient of 1, suggesting a 1:1 interaction between the channel and the drug. (b) representative current traces before and after the
application of 1 µm  xxxd2638xxx . currents were evoked by 50 ms step depolarizations from ⫺100 mv to 0 mv at 0.1 hz. scale bars beside the
current traces correspond to 0.3 na.

from ⫺100 to ⫺60 mv.  xxxd2638xxx  was 4 to 5 fold more
potent when the membrane was maintained at the less
polarized potential. apparent kds at ⫺100 mv and ⫺60
mv were respectively 0.3 µm and 0.06 µm for alpha1a, 0.4
µm and 0.02 µm for alpha1e, and 12 µm and 3 µm for alpha1c.
consistent with these findings we observed a significant
leftward shift (7 mv) of the alpha1a inactivation curve in
the presence of 1 µm  xxxd2638xxx  (v0.5 cont: ⫺39 mv;
v0.5 mib: ⫺46 mv). furthermore, the rate of drug washout (koff) was dramatically speeded up at hyperpolarized potentials (data not shown). these data are consistent with a preferential effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on the
inactivated state of each ca2+ channel subtype
(bezprozvanny and tsien, 1995).
3.4. modulation by b-subunits
we further assessed whether factors influencing the
voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1a, alpha1e and alpha1c
modulate the effect of  xxxd2638xxx . in particular, we concentrated our study on the potential role of the various
beta subunits, in view of their differential modulation of
the decay kinetics of ca2+ currents. for example, the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
isoform promotes a slowing of the voltage-dependent
inactivation of the ca2+ current generated by most of the

 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subtypes (olcese et al., 1994; qin et al., 1998). similar results are reported on fig. 4 which shows that the
global decay kinetics of the ca2+ currents generated by
alpha1a, alpha1e and alpha1c were much slower when coexpressed
with beta2a instead of beta1b (fig. 4a). consistent with the
slower kinetics, the steady-state inactivation curves of
alpha1a and alpha1e were dramatically shifted towards a more
positive potential in the presence of beta2a (fig. 4b). in
contrast, almost no shift was observed with alpha1c but the
inactivation time course was incomplete (fig. 4b) consistent with the presence of the non-inactivating component observed in fig. 4a. therefore the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  would be predicted to be dependent upon the nature
of the beta-subunit.
the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  was therefore compared in the
presence of either the beta1b or the beta2a subunit. first, it was
obvious that the inhibition of each type of current (i.e.
currents generated by alpha1a, alpha1e and alpha1c) was weaker with
beta2a (fig. 5). the concentration of drug required to block
the same fraction of current was approximately 10 fold
higher for alpha1a (kd[beta1b] 0.3 µm; kd[beta2a] 3 µm) and for
alpha1e (kd[beta1b] 0.4 µm; kd(beta2a) 3 µm). there was much
less difference in the case of alpha1c (kd[beta1b] 12 µm ;
kd[beta2a] 21 µm) probably due to the smaller effect of beta2a
on the steady-state inactivation curve of alpha1c (fig. 4b).

(+ xxxg831xxx  and beta1b) at holding potentials of ⫺100 mv and ⫺60 mv respectively. note that depolarization increased substantially channel sensitivity
towards the drug. step depolarizations of 50 ms to 0 mv were delivered either from ⫺100 mv or ⫺60 mv at 0.1 hz. (b) effect of 1 µm  xxxd2638xxx 
on the steady-state inactivation curve of alpha1a (+ xxxg831xxx  and beta1b). note the significant shift of the curve to the left in the presence of the drug. a 5 sec
conditioning depolarization and a 100 ms test pulse were applied every 25 s (interval sufficient to allow recovery from inactivation).

3.5. differential block of a1 splice variants
in addition to the differential modulatory effects of the
 xxxg217xxx  isoforms, each  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit also exhibits distinct
biophysical properties. certain critical regions within the
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  molecules determining their diverse voltage-dependent inactivation have been mapped by structure-function studies (zhang et al., 1994; parent et al., 1995). it
was notably shown that an alternatively spliced alpha1a isoform (alpha1a–b) exhibits markedly reduced inactivation
(bourinet et al., 1999). this effect was attributed to a
single amino acid insertion within the linker between the
first and the second transmembrane domain. thus, we
compared the  xxxd2638xxx  block of alpha1a–b and alpha1a–a. as
it was difficult to obtain comparable current densities of
these isoforms in tsa201 cells, we transiently expressed
them in xenopus oocytes, where they generate similar
current density. inactivation protocols showed the distinct inactivation of the two alpha1a variants. while the alpha1a–a
current was almost totally inactivated at the end of a 15
s depolarization to 0 mv, a large component of alpha1a–b
current remained (苲20% inactivated current fig. 6a).

construction of the inactivation curves from these protocols further indicated partial inactivation of alpha1a–b channels and a shift by about 20 mv towards more depolarized potentials. when hps were maintained for at least
one minute to achieve steady-state conditions (see protocol in fig. 6b), the fraction of current inactivated at ⫺80
mv was negligible for alpha1a–b but substantial for alpha1a–a
channels (fig. 6b). in parallel with these differences in
inactivation properties, the dose-response curves (fig.
6c) showed that alpha1a–b was much less sensitive to  xxxd2638xxx  than alpha1a–a (kd [alpha1a–a]=12 µm vs kd [alpha1a–b]=66
µm).
3.6. use dependent inhibition
in addition to the voltage-dependent block, some calcium antagonists decrease ca2+ channel activity with a
use-dependent effect. in this process drug action is conditioned by repetitive opening of the channel. this type
of block is enhanced upon increasing the stimulation frequency. bezprozvanny and tsien (1995) as well as aczél
et al. (1998) have demonstrated the use-dependent effect

fig. 4. comparison of the voltage-dependent inactivation of recombinant ca2+ channels with two distinct beta subunits. (a) inactivation kinetics of
all ca2+ channels are slowed by beta2a subunit coexpression. (b) mean steady state inactivation curves obtained for 8 to 15 cells with either beta1b or
beta2a subunits. boltzmann fit across the data point clearly show that beta2a shifted the curve toward more depolarized potentials for alpha1a and alpha1e, while
alpha1c is less affected.

fig. 5. coexpression of ca2+ channel with beta2a results in a reduced blocking efficacy by  xxxd2638xxx . dose-response curves obtained with alpha1a, alpha1e,
and alpha1c coexpressed with  xxxg831xxx  and with either beta1b or beta2a. the stimulation protocol was as described in fig. 2. note that the magnitude of the beta2a
effect on  xxxd2638xxx  block parallels the beta2a modulation of the steady state inactivation shown in fig. 4b.

of  xxxd2638xxx  notably on alpha1a channels. we assessed
whether this process could be evidenced in our experimental conditions. however, we found that increasing
the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 hz to 1 hz
strongly decreased the current generated by alpha1a subunit
expressed with beta1b. this decrease reflected spontaneous
inactivation promoted by the stimulation rate which
would indeed favor voltage-depend block as described
in fig. 3. by contrast, with beta2a instead of beta1b, a similar

increase in the frequency of stimulation had no effect on
alpha1a currents. therefore we used this subunit combination that minimized the contribution of spontaneous
voltage-dependent block to explore the use-dependent
inhibition. in agreement with the work of bezprozvanny
and tsien (1995), we found that an increase in the stimulation rate strengthens the action of  xxxd2638xxx  (fig. 7b).
thus, we conclude that  xxxd2638xxx  can block ca2+ channels with several mechanisms.

for t-type vs l-type ca2+ channels in cardiovascular
tissues (mishra and hermsmeyer, 1994; benardeau and
ertel, 1998). therefore t-type ca2+ channel blockade
appeared to be the most straightforward molecular explanation of the drug’s therapeutic benefit (ertel et al.,
1997). however this should be re-examined as, i) a clear
role of t-channels in cardiovascular physiology has yet
to be established; and ii)  xxxd2638xxx  can also potently
block most high-voltage-activated ca2+ channel subtypes (viana et al., 1997; randall and tsien, 1997;
mcdonough and bean, 1998), including partially inactivated cardiac l-type channels (mangoni et al., 1997).
thus the question as to whether the clinical effects of
 xxxd2638xxx  may involve a broader action on diverse ca2+
channel subtypes should be addressed. the molecular
mechanisms governing the interactions between  xxxd2638xxx  and various types of recombinant ca2+ channels
expressed in mammalian were therefore dissected in
detail.

4. discussion
the repertoire of therapeutic molecules acting on
vgccs (also called ca2+ channel antagonists) is to date
restricted to l type channels, and therefore preferentially
targets cell types expressing these channels (mostly cardiovascular cells). in contrast a recently developed molecule,  xxxd2638xxx , has been reported to be more selective

our experiments provide the first comparison of the
functional properties and  xxxd2638xxx  sensitivity of alpha1a,
alpha1c and alpha1e channels expressed in mammalian cells at
physiological external calcium concentration. compared
to xenopus oocytes, the recipient cells mostly used so
far to compare cloned ca2+ channel properties, the kinetics of recombinant channels in tsa201 cells are more
closely related to that of their native counterparts. as
observed in oocytes (bezprozvanny and tsien, 1995),
application of  xxxd2638xxx  inhibited recombinant alpha1a,
alpha1c, and alpha1e channels with a one to one ca2+ channel–
 xxxd2638xxx  interaction. the drug was clearly less effective on alpha1c l-type ca2+ channels than on alpha1a and alpha1e.
in terms of specificity the inhibition by  xxxd2638xxx  of
both alpha1a and alpha1e channels coexpressed with beta1b was
quite similar to that reported for native t-type ca2+
channels or recombinant alpha1h (cribbs et al., 1998). in
comparison to the oocyte expression system, we
observed an increased potency of the drug and a larger
difference in sensitivity between alpha1c, and alpha1a or alpha1e
(but see below the role of  xxxg217xxx ).
4.2. voltage-dependent effects of  xxxd2638xxx 
an important feature of ca2+ channel antagonists is
their mode of action on the channel itself (hering et al.,
1998). for example, dhps have a better affinity at depolarized membrane potential for the inactivated state of
l-type ca2+ channels (bean, 1984). our results show
that state-dependent block with  xxxd2638xxx  is not restricted to l-type channels (alpha1c), but is a common feature
for all the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subtypes, in agreement with bezprozvanny
and tsien (1995). analysis of our results using the

fig. 7. use-dependent block of alpha1a ca2+ channels by  xxxd2638xxx . (a) effect of changing the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 hz to 1 hz on
alpha1a calcium currents. note that this acceleration in the frequency profoundly reduced alpha1a  xxxg831xxx  beta1b currents (left panel) while it spared alpha1a  xxxg831xxx  beta2a
currents (right panel). the histograms in insets are means of four to five experiments. (b) acceleration of stimulation frequency enhanced alpha1a
(+ xxxg831xxx  beta2a) channel block by  xxxd2638xxx  (1 µm). depolarization of 50 ms in duration to 0 mv were applied from ⫺100 mv every 10 s (0.1 hz) or
1 s (1 hz).

modulated receptor hypothesis (as in bean, 1984; bezprozvanny and tsien, 1995; mcdonough and bean,
1998) showed that the affinity for the inactivated state
is 50 to 100 fold higher than for the resting state (not
shown). however, despite this homology with l-type
channel block by dhps, published studies using chimeras of alpha1c and alpha1e led to the conclusion that  xxxd2638xxx 
and dhp have distinct receptor sites (schuster et al.,
1996). thus distinct drug binding sites on ca2+ channels
can support state-dependent block.
4.3. factors affecting voltage-dependent inactivation
modulate  xxxd2638xxx  block
various factors account for the wealth of heterogeneity in calcium channel inactivation, including the different combinatorial possibilities provided by the diverse
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and beta subunits, and the existence of variants generated by alternative splicing within each class of subunit.
however there has been essentially no report of altered
pharmacology as a consequence of these factors. our
data supports a close control of the  xxxd2638xxx  receptor
site by factors governing voltage-dependent inactivation.

first, coexpression of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits with beta2a markedly
reduced the degree of  xxxd2638xxx  block of channels subtypes exhibiting “pure” voltage-dependent inactivation.
this occurred typically with alpha1a and alpha1e. in contrast,
with alpha1c channels which display weak voltage-dependent inactivation compared to prominent ca2+-dependent
inactivation, the effect of beta2a coexpression on  xxxd2638xxx 
block is less pronounced. this suggests that the ef-hand
region in the alpha1c carboxy terminus which accounts for
ca2+-sensitive inactivation (deleon et al., 1995) does
not interfere with  xxxd2638xxx  binding. second, the ultra
slow voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1a channels
generated by a single valine insertion in the intracellular
loop between domains i and ii, also reduced  xxxd2638xxx 
blocking affinity. third, it is interesting to note that both
beta2a coexpression and the valine insert in the domain i–
ii linker of alpha1a which are cumulative in terms of slowing
inactivation, are also additive in terms of reducing the
effects of  xxxd2638xxx . therefore our results suggest that
the blocking properties of  xxxd2638xxx  closely depend on
factors affecting voltage-dependent inactivation of ca2+
channels. these include differences in the subunit composition of ca2+ channels, but also many other factors

c. jiménez et al. / neuropharmacology 39 (2000) 1–10

known to alter voltage-dependent inactivation properties
such as channel-syntaxin interactions (bezprozvanny et
al., 1995) or the phosphorylation state of the channel
(stea et al., 1995).
4.4. pharmacological implications
consequently to understand the effect of  xxxd2638xxx 
and ca2+ channel antagonists in general, it is crucial to
consider both tissue and sub-cellular localization of calcium channel subunits as well as their specific associations. it has been demonstrated that  xxxd2638xxx  does not
cross the blood brain barrier and therefore has an effect
limited to the cardiovascular system, inducing hypotension without increasing heart frequency.
it is well established that the ubiquitous and predominant ca2+ channel in the different adult cardiovascular
muscle cells is the l-type, with in some case coexistence
with t-type. thus, even if  xxxd2638xxx  is more selective
for t-type versus l-type channels, the effect of t-type
channel inhibition in the hypotensive action of the drug
remains obscure. so far, t-type ca2+ channels have been
identified in cultured but rarely in freshly dissociated
arterial myocytes (richard and nargeot, 1998). in agreement with this finding, no evidence for a role of t-type
ca2+ channels in the contractile activity of smooth muscle cells has been provided. therefore, blockade of the
diverse vascular smooth muscle l-type ca2+ channels is
certainly a candidate mechanism to explain the hypotensive effect, considering the state-dependent block by
 xxxd2638xxx  and the depolarized resting potential of these
cells. moreover, at the molecular level, the alpha1c gene is
able to generate a splice variant giving rise to marked
voltage-dependent inactivation and probably a more pronounced affinity for  xxxd2638xxx  (soldatov et al., 1997).
the tissue distribution of these splice variants needs to
be taken into account. in addition, another factor that
might contribute to an increased  xxxd2638xxx  sensitivity
of l-type ca2+ channels is the presence of the  xxxg838xxx  subunit
isoform in human smooth muscle cells (collin et al.,
1994), since this isoform is the most efficient in conferring fast inactivation to nearly all  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits (olcese
et al., 1994).
apart from muscle cells,  xxxd2638xxx  certainly blocks
non l-type ca2+ channels in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells within the cardiovascular system, such as the
intracardiac and vascular parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve terminals and chromaffin cells. in these cell
types, at synaptic endings in particular, neurotransmitter
release is triggered by p/q- and n-type channels (alpha1a
and alpha1b subunits), and possibly r-type channels (alpha1e,
jeons and wurster, 1997). the potent inhibition of these
channels by  xxxd2638xxx , and consequently the inhibition
of neurohumoral control of vasculature may be involved
in the overall effect of the drug. consistent with this
idea, a recent report showed that  xxxd2638xxx  at clinical

9

doses inhibits noradrenaline release in human heart
though a blockade of n-type channels (gothert and molderings, 1997). block of the sympathetic tone would also
be expected to play a role on perivascular nerve endings,
since the density of these synapses is increased in hypertensive animal models such as shr rats (burnstock,
1993).

5. concluding remarks
altogether, our data are consistent with a voltagedependent block which implies that ca2+ channel diversity resulting from combinations of the different types
of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits (and their respective variants) and the
different beta subunits may significantly affect pharmacological properties. demonstration of a potent block by
 xxxd2638xxx  of various hva calcium channels in the same
range of concentration as that blocking t-type channels
should contribute to our understanding of the drug
effects, and to further development of derivatives for
new therapeutic targets, notably in the cns.
