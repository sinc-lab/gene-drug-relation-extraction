abstract
joint manipulation has long been used for pain relief. however, the underlying mechanisms for manipulation-related pain relief remain
largely unexplored. the purpose of the current study was to determine which spinal neurotransmitter receptors mediate manipulationinduced antihyperalgesia. rats were injected with capsaicin (50 ml, 0.2%) into one ankle joint and mechanical withdrawal threshold
measured before and after injection. the mechanical withdrawal threshold decreases 2 h after capsaicin injection. two hours after capsaicin
injection, the following drugs were administered intrathecally: bicuculline, blocks g- xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptors; naloxone,
blocks opioid receptors; yohimbine blocks, a2-adrenergic receptors; and  xxxd2621xxx , blocks 5-ht1/2 receptors. in addition, nan-190,
 xxxd2419xxx , and mdl-72222 were administered to selectively block 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, and 5-ht3 receptors, respectively. knee joint
manipulation was performed 15 min after administration of drug. the knee joint was flexed and extended to end range of extension while the
tibia was simultaneously translated in an anterior to posterior direction. the treatment group received three applications of manipulation,
each 3 min in duration separated by 1 min of rest. knee joint manipulation after capsaicin injection into the ankle joint significantly increases
the mechanical withdrawal threshold for 45 min after treatment. spinal blockade of 5-ht1/2 receptors with  xxxd2621xxx  prevented, while
blockade of a2-adrenergic receptors attenuated, the manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia. nan-190 also blocked manipulation-induced
antihyperalgesia suggesting that effects of  xxxd2621xxx  are mediated by  xxxg1108xxx  blockade. however, spinal blockade of opioid or
gabaa receptors had no effect on manipulation induced-antihyperalgesia. thus, the antihyperalgesia produced by joint manipulation
appears to involve descending inhibitory mechanisms that utilize serotonin and noradrenaline.

1. introduction
joint manipulation has long been used as a modality for
pain relief. the use of this form of manual therapy has evolved
from the traditions of bonesetting to orthodox practice in a
number of health care disciplines. modern manipulative
therapy can range from slow oscillating glides to high velocity,
low amplitude techniques (haldeman and hooper, 1999).
manipulation-induced analgesia has been demonstrated in

a number of studies in human subjects (vernon et al., 1990;
vicenzino et al., 1996, 1998; zusman et al., 1989). also, recent
meta-analyses of the clinical literature, focusing on spinal
manipulation, suggest that manipulative therapy is effective
for the treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain
(bronfort, 1999; van tulder et al., 1997). however, the
underlying physiological mechanisms for joint manipulationrelated pain relief remain largely unexplored.
it has been suggested that manipulation-induced analgesia may be a multifactorial effect resulting from beneficial
influences on the chemical environment of peripheral joints,
facilitation of tissue repair processes, segmental inhibitory
processes within the central nervous system and activation
of descending inhibitory pathways projecting from the brain

to spinal cord (wright, 1995; wright and vicenzino, 1995).
recently, we showed that knee joint manipulation decreases
secondary mechanical hyperalgesia in the paw induced by
injection of capsaicin into the ankle joint in rat (sluka and
wright, 2001). since the manipulation is proximal to the
injured joint, these data suggest that central neural
mechanisms mediate the reduction in hyperalgesia.
blockade of spinal receptors can elucidate potential
mechanisms for the antihyperalgesia produced by joint
manipulation. a number of different receptors found in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord may be involved. presynaptic
inhibition can occur through activation of spinal gaminobutyric acid (gaba) receptors on primary afferent
fibers, which depolarize the terminal thus inhibiting
neurotransmitter release from primary afferents and the
consequent incoming afferent activity (see eccles et al.,
1962; sluka et al., 1995). gaba receptors are also located
post-synaptically and when activated hyperpolarize the
neuron thus decreasing the effectiveness of excitatory input
(malcangio and bowery, 1996).
opioids are involved in both segmental inhibition and
descending inhibition (fields and basbaum, 1999). however, systemic blockade of opioid receptors with naloxone
has no effect on the analgesia produced by manipulation in
humans (vicenzino et al., 2000; zusman et al., 1989).
descending inhibitory pathways from the rostral ventral
medulla (rvm) utilize serotonin as a neurotransmitter and
those from dorsolateral pons utilize noradrenline (fields and
basbaum, 1999). the purpose of this study is to determine,
using behavioral pharmacology techniques, which dorsal
horn neurotransmitter receptors mediate this manipulationinduced antihyperalgesic effect.

2. methods
all experiments were approved by the animal care and
use committee at the university of iowa and are in
accordance with the national institutes of health and the
international association for the study of pain policies on
use of laboratory animals.
2.1. joint inflammation
male sprague-dawley rats (250 – 350 g, harlan, indianapolis, in; n ¼ 113) were anesthetized briefly with
halothane (2 – 5% v/v) and injected with 50 ml of 0.2%
w/v capsaicin (sigma, st louis, mo) into the left ankle
joint. this produces a robust secondary mechanical
hyperalgesia of the paw, which is fully developed in 2 h
after injection (sluka, 2002).
2.2. drug administration
intrathecal catheters (32 g, polyurethane; 10.5 cm;
recathco, allison park, pa) were placed acutely

immediately prior to drug administration (storkson et al.,
1996). prior to insertion, a 32-gauge polyurethane catheter
was glued to pe 10 tubing (0.28 mm id, polyethylene;
5 cm; becton dickson and company, sparks, md).
animals were anesthetized with halothane (2 – 5% v/v)
and a 23-gauge hypodermic needle was inserted through the
skin into the l5 – l6 intervertebral space until a tail flick was
noted. the 32-gauge polyurethane catheter was inserted into
the intrathecal space through the needle and advanced
cranially until 3.5 – 4.0 cm was under the skin. after
placement, the needle was withdrawn. drugs were then
given intrathecally, through the catheter, while the animal
remained anesthetized, and the catheter removed after drug
administration. acute catheter placement was chosen
instead of direct spinal injection in order to insure that the
drug was targeted specifically to the lumbar enlargement
and the effects of dilution and diffusion on drug concentration at the target site would be minimized. it was not
possible, therefore, to verify catheter placement in these
experiments with acute catheter placement since the
catheter is removed after drug administration. however,
the experimenters placing the catheters have performed
hundreds of chronic catheter placements with approximate
accuracy of 99% (skyba et al., 2002; sluka, 2002). further,
the presence of a tail flick upon needle insertion is a good
indication that the needle has access to the intrathecal space.
bicuculline methiodide (0.3 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 11), naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate (10 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 12),
 xxxd2621xxx  maleate (30 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 12), or yohimbine
hydrochloride (30 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 10) were administered
spinally to block g- xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptors
(kaneko and hammond, 1997), opioid receptors
(dickenson et al., 1981; woolf, 1980), serotonergic
(5-ht1 and 5-ht2) receptors (calejesan et al., 1998), or
a2-adrenergic receptors (sawynok and reed, 1991),
respectively. in addition, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4(4-[2-phthalimido]butyl)piperazine hydrobromide (nan190, 15 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 12),  xxxd2419xxx  tartrate (30 mg/
10 ml; n ¼ 14), or 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (mdl72222, 12 mg/10 ml; n ¼ 12) were administered spinally to
block 5-ht1a (mjellem et al., 1993), 5-ht2a (sasaki et al.,
2001), or 5-ht3 receptors (sasaki et al., 2001), respectively.
all doses were chosen based on previously published
studies showing selectivity for the specific receptor type/
subtype(s), e.g. blocking the analgesic effects of the
corresponding receptor agonist. all drugs were purchased
from sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo, usa). isotonic,
sterile saline adjusted to ph 7.2 served as a vehicle control
ðn ¼ 12þ: drugs were given 15 min prior to the joint
manipulation while the animal was anesthetized with
halothane (1 – 2% v/v). all animals received only one
administration of antagonist or vehicle. none of the drugs
administered intrathecally had any effect on gross motor
function, i.e. gait or withdrawal to noxious stimuli.
in our laboratory, we previously tested yohimbine
hydrochloride,  xxxd2621xxx  maleate, nan-190,  xxxd2419xxx ,

d.a. skyba et al. / pain 106 (2003) 159–168

and mdl-72222 and showed that the doses used in the
current study blocked the analgesic effects of appropriate
receptor agonists (radhakrishnan et al., 2003). also, in the
current study, we confirmed that the doses of naloxone
hydrochloride dihydrate and bicuculline methiodide blocked
the analgesic effects of their agonists. two hours after intraarticular capsaicin injection, separate groups of animals were
pretreated with bicuculline methiodide (0.3 mg/10 ml;
n ¼ 4), naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate (10 mg/10 ml;
n ¼ 5), or vehicle (2 groups; n ¼ 9). after 15 min, animals
in the naloxone group and one of the vehicle groups received
i.t. injections of  xxxd2670xxx  (1 mg/ml; sigma, st louis,
mo), while animals in the bicuculline group and the
other vehicle group received i.t. injections of muscimol
(0.1 mg/10 ml; sigma, st louis, mo).
2.3. joint manipulation
after drug administration, anesthesia was maintained
with 1– 2% v/v halothane for approximately 30 min. the
knee joint manipulation was performed under anesthesia
15 min after drug administration. the femur ipsilateral to
the injection site was stabilized, and manipulation was
performed by moving the tibia on the femur. the knee joint
was flexed and extended to the end range of extension while
the tibia was simultaneously translated in an anterior to
posterior direction. the treatment group received three
applications of manipulation, each 3 min in duration
separated by 1 min of rest. our group has previously
shown this time frame to be optimal for producing
antihyperalgesia in this model (sluka and wright, 2001).
three control groups were utilized: (1) vehicle was given
with manipulation; (2) vehicle was given with anesthesia
only; and (3) drugs were given with anesthesia only.
previously, we demonstrated that anesthesia with hand
contact (sham) has no effect on the hyperalgesia and is
similar to anesthesia alone (sluka and wright, 2001).
2.4. behavioral measurements
animals were tested for withdrawal thresholds to
mechanical stimuli (von frey filaments) applied to the
plantar aspect of the hindpaw (gopalkrishnan and sluka,
2000). von frey filaments with bending forces from 9 to
418 mn were applied in a progressively increasing manner
until the hindpaw was withdrawn or 418 mn was reached.
each filament was applied twice. the filament of lowest
bending force from which the animal withdrew was
considered the mechanical withdrawal threshold of the
hindpaw. after a response, the filaments above and
below were tested to confirm the withdrawal threshold.
the test – retest reliability of this method was previously
established (r 2 ¼ 0:7; p ¼ 0:007) (gopalkrishnan and
sluka, 2000). tests were performed before and 2 h after
capsaicin injection, and 15, 30, 45 min and 1 h after joint
manipulation.

161

2.5. statistical analysis
differences in mechanical withdrawal thresholds
between groups were assessed with a kruskal – wallis
analysis of variance test and a mann – whitney u post-hoc
test. values were considered significant at p # 0:05: all
data are presented as the median with the 25th and 75th
percentiles.

3. results
3.1. joint manipulation reverses mechanical hyperalgesia
two hours after injection of capsaicin into the ankle
joint, there was a decrease in the mechanical withdrawal
threshold of the ipsilateral paw for all groups (p ¼ 0:0001;
signed rank test). manipulation of the knee joint significantly increased the mechanical withdrawal threshold of the
ipsilateral paw 15 min (p ¼ 0:03; signed rank test), 30 min
(p ¼ 0:05; signed rank test), and 45 min (p ¼ 0:03; signed
rank test) after application (fig. 1). the decrease in
withdrawal threshold returned by 60 min.
analysis of all groups shows a significant group effect for
mechanical withdrawal threshold 15 min ( x2 ¼ 68;
p ¼ 0:0001), 30 min ðx2 ¼ 52; p ¼ 0:0001þ; and 45 min
ðx2 ¼ 34; p ¼ 0:003þ after joint manipulation. the following results are organized by drug treatment.
3.2.  xxxd2621xxx  prevents manipulation-induced
antihyperalgesia
spinal administration of  xxxd2621xxx  maleate
(30 mg/10 ml), 15 min before manipulation of the knee
joint, prevented the increase in mechanical withdrawal
thresholds resulting from the treatment. withdrawal
threshold values for the group pretreated with  xxxd2621xxx 
were significantly less when compared to the manipulation
and vehicle group 15 min ðp ¼ 0:009þ; 30 min ðp ¼ 0:041þ;
and 45 min ðp ¼ 0:026þ after manipulation (fig. 1a).
 xxxd2621xxx  without joint manipulation had no effect on
the decreased mechanical withdrawal threshold, and
thresholds were similar to intrathecal injection of vehicle
without joint manipulation.
3.3. yohimbine attenuates manipulation-induced
antihyperalgesia
intrathecal administration of yohimbine hydrochloride
(30 mg/10 ml) 15 min prior to manipulation of the knee joint
attenuated the increase in withdrawal threshold, which
results from knee joint manipulation. the withdrawal
threshold for the group pretreated with yohimbine was
significantly less 15 min ðp ¼ 0:041þ after manipulation
when compared to the group that received vehicle prior
to manipulation (fig. 1b). yohimbine without joint

fig. 1. graphs represent the mechanical withdrawal threshold for groups of animals that received drug or vehicle and subsequently knee joint manipulation or
no treatment. separate groups received intrathecal (i.t.) injection of  xxxd2621xxx  (a), yohimbine (b), bicuculline (c), or naloxone (d) 2 h after 0.2% intraarticular capsaicin and 15 min prior to joint manipulation. spinal injection of  xxxd2621xxx  (30 mg/10 ml) significantly prevented the manipulation-induced
increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold at 15, 30, and 45 min compared with the ‘vehicle, manipulation’ control group. yohimbine (30 mg/10 ml) had a
partial effect, decreasing the mechanical withdrawal threshold 15 min post-manipulation. neither i.t. bicuculline (0.3 mg/10 ml) nor naloxone (10 mg/10 ml)
significantly affected the increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold resulting from knee joint manipulation. data are presented as medians with 25th and 75th
percentiles. *significantly less than manipulation with vehicle control ðp , 0:5þ:

manipulation had no effect on the decreased mechanical
withdrawal threshold, and thresholds were similar to
intrathecal injection of vehicle under anesthesia without
joint manipulation (fig. 1b).
3.4. bicuculline or naloxone does not affect
manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia
intrathecal administration of bicuculline methiodide
(0.3 mg/10 ml) or naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate
(10 mg/10 ml), prior to manipulation of the knee joint,
had no effect on the resultant increase in mechanical
withdrawal thresholds when compared to vehicle control

(fig. 1c and d). further, neither drug without joint
manipulation affected the decreased mechanical withdrawal
thresholds produced by capsaicin, and thresholds were
similar to vehicle without joint manipulation (fig. 1c
and d). this suggests that the changes in withdrawal
thresholds noted in treatment groups result from joint
manipulation and not from administration of the receptor
antagonists.
while the doses of bicuculline and naloxone were chosen
based on previously published work (dickenson et al., 1981;
kaneko and hammond, 1997; woolf, 1980), we tested them
against their agonists in this model to confirm that they were
adequate to block spinal gabaa and opioid receptors,

respectively. administration of either morphine or muscimol in vehicle groups increased mechanical withdrawal
thresholds 15 and 30 min after drug injection (table 1).
however, pretreatment with naloxone completely blocked
the effect of morphine, and pretreatment with bicuculline
completely blocked the effect of muscimol on mechanical
withdrawal thresholds (table 1). thus, the inability of
spinal naloxone and bicuculline to prevent or attenuate
manipulation-induced changes in mechanical withdrawal
thresholds is not due to ineffective blockade of spinal opioid
or gabaa receptors.
3.5. effects of selective 5-ht receptor antagonists
spinal administration of nan-190 (15 mg/10 ml,
5-ht1a) 15 min before knee joint manipulation prevented
the increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold resulting
from the manipulation. withdrawal threshold values for the
ipsilateral side were significantly less than those for the
manipulation and vehicle group 15 min ðp ¼ 0:002þ; 30 min
ðp ¼ 0:015þ; and 45 min ðp ¼ 0:002þ after manipulation
(fig. 2a). nan-190 without joint manipulation had no
effect on the decreased mechanical withdrawal threshold,
and thresholds were similar to intrathecal injection of
vehicle without joint manipulation.
in contrast, spinal administration of  xxxd2419xxx 
(30 mg/10 ml, 5-ht 2a) or mdl-72222 (12 mg/10 ml,
5-ht3) prior to knee joint manipulation had no effect on
the increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold resulting
from the treatment (fig. 2b and c).  xxxd2419xxx  or mdl72222 also had no effect on the decreased mechanical
withdrawal thresholds resulting from intra-articular capsaicin injection, and thresholds were similar to intrathecal
injection of vehicle without joint manipulation.

4. discussion
blockade of spinal cord serotonin receptors prevents the
antihyperalgesia resulting from knee joint manipulation.
also, blockade of a2-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord
attenuates the antihyperalgesia produced by knee joint
manipulation. in contrast, spinal administration of gabaa
or opioid receptor antagonists does not affect manipulationinduced antihyperalgesia in this animal model. further,

selective serotonin receptor antagonists were administered
to determine the serotonin receptor subtype (s) involved in
this antihyperalgesia. blockade of spinal 5-ht1a receptors,
but not 5-ht2a or 5-ht3 receptors, prevents manipulationinduced antihyperalgesia. these data suggest that knee joint
manipulation activates descending inhibitory pathways that
utilize serotonin and noradrenaline, which inhibit transmission of nociceptive information by acting on 5-ht1a and
a2-adrenergic receptors in spinal cord of rats.
it should be noted that this study was designed so that an
uninjured joint, proximal to the site of injury was
manipulated. this manipulation is within the normal
working range of the joint that activates large diameter
joint afferents in the uninjured knee joint (see schaible and
grubb, 1993). thus, manipulation of the uninjured knee is
expected to activate large diameter afferent fibers to reduce
hyperalgesia.
4.1. descending monoaminergic inhibitory pathways
serotonergic fibers in the spinal cord originate supraspinally in the rvm whereas noradrenergic fibers in the spinal
cord originate supraspinally in the dorsolateral pons (clark
and proudfit, 1991; fields and basbaum, 1999; westlund
et al., 1983). agonists to serotonergic and a2-adrenergic
receptors delivered spinally produce analgesia, reduce
hyperalgesia, and reduce dorsal horn neuron activity
(ali et al., 1994; barasi and clatworthy, 1987; bardin
et al., 2000, 2001; eide, 1992; fairbanks and wilcox, 1999;
oyama et al., 1996; sawynok and reed, 1991; yang et al.,
1994; zhao and duggan, 1988).
the periaquaductal gray (pag) sends projections to both
rvm and dorsolateral pons (a6/a7 cell groups) (beitz,
1982; cameron et al., 1995). from there neurons in both
rvm and dorsolateral pons project to the spinal cord (clark
and proudfit, 1991; fields and basbaum, 1999; skagerberg
and bjorklund, 1985; sluka and westlund, 1992; westlund
et al., 1983). there is also evidence that activation of
neurons in the rvm, some of which contain  xxxg2240xxx ,
produces spinal antinociception indirectly through connections with descending noradrenergic fibers in the a7 cell
group (nuseir et al, 1999; yeomans and proudfit, 1990,
1992). noradrenaline is the primary neurotransmitter of
neurons in the dorsolateral pons and serotonin of neurons in
the rvm (clark and proudfit, 1991; fields and basbaum,

fig. 2. graphs represent the mechanical withdrawal thresholds for groups of animals that received intrathecal (i.t.) injection of the 5-ht1a antagonist, nan190 (a), the 5-ht2a antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx  (b), or the 5-ht3 antagonist, mdl-72222 (c) 2 h after 0.2% intra-articular capsaicin and 15 min prior to joint
manipulation. spinal administration of nan-190 (30 mg/10 ml, 5-ht1a) significantly prevented the manipulation-induced increase in mechanical withdrawal
threshold at 15 min, 30 min, 45 min compared with the ‘vehicle, manipulation’ control group. neither i.t.  xxxd2419xxx  (30 mg/10 ml, 5-ht2a) nor mdl-72222
(12 mg/10 ml, 5-ht3) significantly affected the increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold resulting from knee joint manipulation. data are presented as
medians with 25th and 75th percentiles. *significantly less than manipulation with vehicle control ðp , 0:05þ:

1999; skagerberg and bjorklund, 1985). in fact, stimulation
of pag or rvm increases release of 5-ht and noradrenaline spinally (bowker and abhold, 1990; cui et al., 1999;
hammond et al., 1985; sorkin et al., 1993). electrical
stimulation of any of these descending inhibitory pathways
exerts inhibitory effects on dorsal horn neurons (fields et al.,

1977) and produces antinociception (aimone et al., 1987;
basbaum et al., 1976; fields and basbaum, 1999; jones and
gebhart, 1986; mayer et al., 1971; reynolds, 1969;
yeomans et al., 1992). in the current study, spinal
administration of  xxxd2621xxx  or yohimbine prevents or
decreases joint manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia.

d.a. skyba et al. / pain 106 (2003) 159–168

since serotonin and noradrenaline in spinal cord are
released from descending bulbospinal neurons, our data
strongly support the hypothesis that joint manipulationinduced antihyperalgesia involves activation of descending
inhibitory pathways. however, since naloxone has no effect
on joint manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia, this
suggests activation of non-opioid descending inhibitory
systems. further, blockade of gaba receptors in the spinal
cord has no effect on joint manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia, suggesting that presynaptic or local inhibitory
pathways are likely not involved in joint manipulation
antihyperalgesia.
the role of this descending analgesia system in
modulating pain-related behavior may depend on duration
and type of noxious stimuli involved. descending serotonergic neurons do not appear to tonically inhibit spinal
transmission of noxious mechanical or thermal input in
normal animals (bardin et al., 2000; zhuo and gebhart,
1991). in contrast, spinal administration of noradrenergic
receptor antagonists decreases hotplate and tail flick
latencies in rat, indicating that descending noradrenergic
neurons are involved in tonic inhibition of spinal transmission of noxious heat (proudfit and hammond, 1981;
sagen and proudfit, 1984; zhuo and gebhart, 1991). there
is also pharmacological evidence suggesting both descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways are activated
in models of chemogenic and neuropathic pain. intrathecal
pretreatment with  xxxd2621xxx  or yohimbine increases
licking and biting during both phases of the formalin test
and post-treatment increases pain-related behaviors in the
second phase (omote et al., 1998). spinal administration of
 xxxd2621xxx  or yohimbine also further reduces paw
withdrawal latencies to heat after chronic constriction
injury (satoh and omote, 1996). further, dorsal horn serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations increase bilaterally
after formalin injection and after chronic constriction injury
(omote et al., 1998; satoh and omote, 1996). in the current
study, spinal administration of serotonin or noradrenaline
receptor antagonists does not further reduce mechanical
withdrawal thresholds subsequent to intra-articular capsaicin injection. thus, descending monoaminergic neurons do
not appear to inhibit spinal transmission of mechanical
stimuli (mechanical hyperalgesia) after capsaicin injection.
4.2. selective serotonin receptor antagonists
in this study, spinal administration of  xxxd2621xxx 
prevents joint manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia. the
effectiveness of this non-selective serotonin receptor
antagonist prompted evaluation of more selective serotonin
receptor antagonists. the 5-ht1, 5-ht2, and 5-ht3 types of
serotonin receptors are found in the spinal dorsal horn (kia
et al., 1995; ridet et al., 1994; thor et al., 1993, see
coggeshall and carlton, 1997 for review). however, there is
some controversy regarding the role of serotonin receptors
in spinal antinociception. for instance, spinal administration

165

of  xxxg1108xxx  agonists facilitates nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord (alhaider and wilcox, 1993;
ali et al., 1994; zhang et al., 2001b), inhibits spinal
nociceptive transmission (bardin et al., 2001; mjellem et al.,
1992; oyama et al., 1996), or has no effect (bardin et al.,
2000; millan, 1994; sasaki et al., 2001). in the present
study, spinal administration of  xxxd2621xxx  or nan-190
prevents antihyperalgesia induced by knee joint manipulation. this suggests that peripheral joint manipulation
increases physiological levels of serotonin that predominantly act on spinal 5-ht1a receptors to produce
antihyperalgesia.
the central neural mechanisms by which peripheral nonpharmacological manipulations like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) or manipulative therapy
relieve pain are pharmacologically heterogeneous. for
instance both low and high frequency tens decrease
secondary hyperalgesia produced by injection of 3%
kaolin/carrageenan into the knee joint (sluka et al., 1998,
1999). however, the mechanisms for tens-antihyperalgesia differ depending upon frequency of stimulation.
antihyperalgesia produced by low (4 hz) and high
(100 hz) frequency tens is dependent upon spinal mand d-opioid receptors, respectively (sluka et al., 1999),
while data from the current study show that antihyperalgesia
induced by peripheral knee joint manipulation, administered
at a frequency of 0.5 –1 cycles per second, does not depend
on spinal opioid receptors. further, blockade of spinal
5-ht2 or 5-ht3 receptors prevents antihyperalgesia induced
by low, but not high, frequency tens, while blockade of
spinal a2-adrenergic receptors with yohimbine has no effect
(radhakrishnan et al., 2003). in contrast, our data show that
spinal blockade of 5-ht1a and a2-adrenergic receptors
prevents or attenuates antihyperalgesia resultant from knee
joint manipulation. these findings should be tempered by
the fact that the pain model employed may affect serotonin
receptor expression. for instance, carrageenan inflammation is associated with upregulation of 5-ht2a mrna
and increases in extracellular 5-ht in the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord (zhang et al., 2000, 2001a).
4.3. manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia
manipulation of cervical or thoracic spine produces an
immediate, localized hypoalgesic effect and reduces pain in
human subjects (terrett and vernon, 1984; vernon et al.,
1990; vicenzino et al., 1996; zusman et al., 1989). further,
cervical manipulation produces hypoalgesia in, people with
lateral epicondylitis or cervical spine pain, that is
accompanied by sympathoexcitation: evidenced by changes
in skin conductance, blood flow and/or skin temperature
(sterling et al., 2001; vicenzino et al., 1998). in addition,
the initial hypoalgesic effect of spinal manipulation is
not reversed by systemic administration of naloxone
(vicenzino et al., 2000; zusman et al., 1989). wright and
colleagues hypothesize that this coordinated hypoalgesic

166

d.a. skyba et al. / pain 106 (2003) 159–168

and autonomic response may be the result of activation of
descending inhibitory pathways in the central nervous
system. specifically they suggest that joint manipulation
activates the lateral periaqueductal gray since glutamate
excitation of the lateral pag produces a similar response,
namely that of non-opioid analgesia, sympathetic excitation, and motor facilitation (bandler and shipley, 1994;
cannon et al., 1982; lovick, 1991). these data from human
subjects are consistent with the current findings in this
animal model. taken together, we hypothesize that joint
manipulation produces a non-opioid form of analgesia,
mediated by spinal serotonergic and noradrenergic
receptors utilizing descending inhibitory pathways from
the rvm and dorsolateral pons.
although manipulation in clinical settings is often
performed at the site of injury or the spine, a segmentally
related but non-involved joint was chosen in order to
minimize local peripheral effects and focus on those effects
mediated by the central nervous system. further studies are
necessary to more directly investigate supraspinal involvement and evaluate other pain models. as the time/force
profiles of different forms of manipulation vary, other forms
of joint manipulation should also be evaluated.
