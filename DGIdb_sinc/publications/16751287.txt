(scd) is a major public health problem,
killing approximately 400,000 north americans annually (18,
22–24, 29). scd generally occurs in the setting of structural
heart disease including cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. calcineurin is a calcium-activated phosphatase that is intimately
involved in the generation of cardiac hypertrophy. calcineurin
dephosphorylates a cytosolic protein, nuclear factor of activated t cells 3 (nf- xxxg2056xxx ), that translocates into the nucleus to
interact with transcription factors gata binding protein 4 and
myocyte enhancing factor-2 and thus activates a range of
hypertrophic genes (20). molkentin et al. (20) overexpressed a
constitutively active calcineurin in transgenic mouse hearts and
sudden cardiac death

observed massive cardiac hypertrophy followed by fibrosis,
congestive heart failure, and premature death. subsequent
studies showed that those premature sudden deaths were
caused by a progressive conduction defect (heart block generating asystole) with more rarified episodes of nonsustained
pleomorphic ventricular tachycardia (11).
recent studies indicate that overexpression of calcineurin is
associated with development of heart block, whereas overexpression of nf- xxxg2056xxx  is not, even though overexpression of
nf- xxxg2056xxx  produced comparable extents of cardiac hypertrophy
(14). these data suggest that nongenomic effects of calcineurin
contribute to the phenotype. this possibility is in keeping with
previous studies that found that calcineurin can activate a range
of signal transduction pathways, including pkc (10). the
mechanism of the heart block has not been elucidated. although previous studies reported that overexpression of calcineurin causes an increase in the density of l-type calcium
current (ica-l) (36) and a decrease in the density of all components of transient outward potassium current (11), such ion
channel defects could be compensatory to maintain excitability
and contractility but do not easily explain heart block. action
potential (ap) recordings in calcineurin-overexpressing (cn)
mouse hearts showed decreased maximum change of potential
over time (dv/dtmax) of phase 0 of the ap, indicating the
possibility of downregulation of the cardiac sodium channel.
moreover, profound downregulation of the sodium channel
would be expected to produce a conduction defect. accordingly, the density and function of the cardiac sodium channels
were assessed at various stages of development in this transgenic mouse model. parallel in vivo studies addressed the
contribution of decreased sodium channel activity to the heart
block phenotype.
methods

this investigation conformed to the guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals published by the national institutes of health
(nih publication no. 85-23, revised 1996), approved by the animal
care and use committee of the university of calgary.
female wild-type (wt) mice and transgenic cn mice in the icr
background were compared (20). electrophysiological studies were
performed on only one mouse line since molkentin et al. (20) have
reported that all lines have identical cardiac phenotypes. all animals
were housed in the animal care unit of the university of calgary
according to our animal care guidelines.
the genotypes from the f1 and f2 generations of the transgenic
mice were determined by southern blot (20), and all subsequent
the costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment
of page charges. the article must therefore be hereby marked “advertisement”

overexpression of calcineurin in transgenic mouse heart results in
massive cardiac hypertrophy followed by sudden death. sudden
deaths are caused by abrupt transitions from sinus rhythm to heart
block (asystole) in calcineurin-overexpressing (cn) mice. preliminary
studies showed decreased maximum change in potential over time
(dv/dtmax) of phase 0 of the action potential. accordingly, the hypothesis was tested that decreased activity of the sodium channel
contributes to heart block. profound decreases in activity of sodium
currents (ina) paralleled the changes in action potential characteristics.
progressive age-dependent decreases were observed such that at
42–50 days of life little sodium channel function existed. however,
this was not paralleled by decreased protein expression as assessed by
immunocytochemistry or by western blot. since calcineurin can
interact with the ryanodine receptor, we assessed whether chronic in
vitro treatment with bapta-am, thapsigargin, and ryanodine could
rescue the decrease of ina. all of these treatments rescued ina to levels
indistinguishable from wild type. the nonspecific pkc inhibitor
 xxxd2195xxx  also rescued the decrease of ina. to assess
whether decreased sodium channel activity contributes to sudden
death in vivo, the response to  xxxd1991xxx  (20 mg/kg) was assessed: 6 of
10 young cn mice died because of asystole, whereas 0 of 10
wild-type mice died (p ⬍ 0.01). moreover,  xxxd1991xxx  produced
exaggerated prolongation of the qrs width in sinus beats before the
heart block. catecholamine tone appears necessary to support life in older
cn mice because propranolol (1 mg/kg) triggered asystolic death in five
of six cn mice. we conclude that decrease in sodium channel activity is
in the common final pathway to asystole in cn mice.

recovery from inactivation was measured with a standard twopulse protocol. from a holding potential of ⫺110 mv, a 50-ms
conditional pulse to ⫺25 mv was applied, followed by a test pulse
with the same shape but at various intervals from 2 to 150 ms. the
amplitude of the ina was normalized to the amplitude of the conditioning pulse. the protocols were repeated every 8 s. the time course
of the recovery from inactivation was fitted to a two-exponential

the strategy used to measure ina at physiological [na]o was to
measure ina conductance in proximity to its reversal potential. to
have adequate voltage-clamp control under these physiological conditions, the pipette resistance was adjusted from 0.5 to 1 m⍀. the
access resistance was 1–2 m⍀ and was compensated to ⬎90% (11).
the test pulse potentials were applied from ⫹20 to ⫹70 mv for 60 ms

molecular mechanism of decrease in sodium channel expression by
calcineurin. neonatal myocytes were isolated and cultured from wt
mice as described previously (35). for patch-clamp recordings, 2 ⫻
105 myocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips. after 24 h in
culture, the medium was replaced by serum-free medium, and the
virus infection was delivered [control, adenovirus (ad)-green fluorescent protein (gfp) at 5 tissue culture 50% infectious dose (tcid50)/
myocyte or ad-constitutively active calcineurin obtained from j. d.
molkentin (university of cincinnati, cincinnati, oh) at 5 tcid50/
myocyte]. typically 90% of the myocytes showed expression of gfp
24 h after infection. at 12 h after viral infection chronic pharmacological treatments [ryanodine (10 nm), bapta-am (10 ␮m), and
thapsigargin (1 ␮m)] were given. patch-clamp measurements were
performed 24 h after treatment.
sodium channels were labeled with subtype-specific antibodies
against voltage-dependent sodium channel (nav)1.1,  xxxg2024xxx , and
 xxxg2028xxx  subunits and examined under the confocal microscope. we
viewed five to seven myocytes per experiment for each antibody used
in this study, and the results were consistent for all slides examined.
antibodies were provided by w. a. catterall and r. e. westenbroek.
control cells included preincubation of the primary antibodies with
their respective peptides or incubation with no primary antibody.
these negative control studies showed no specific staining. briefly,
single ventricular myocytes were plated on laminin-coated glass
coverslips and incubated (5% co2, 37°c) for 6 –12 h. myocytes were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, rinsed in pbs, 0.1 m tris
buffer (tb), and 0.1 m tris-buffered saline (tbs), treated in 2%
avidin-tbs and rinsed in tbs, treated in 2% biotin-tbs and rinsed in
tbs, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum-tbs-0.1% triton
x-100. the myocytes were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted
1:20 in tbs containing 0.10% triton x-100 and 10% normal goat
serum) overnight at 4°c. myocytes were then rinsed in tbs, incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit igg (diluted 1:300), rinsed in
tbs, incubated in avidin d fluorescein (diluted 1:300), rinsed in tbs,
rinsed in tb, and rinsed in distilled water briefly. coverslips were
mounted on slides with vectashield mounting medium (vector laboratories). cells were viewed with a leica dm rxa2 confocal
microscope. for control cells, either primary antibodies were preincubated with their antigenic peptide or no primary antibody was used.
apparent plasmalemmal expression was quantitated by subtracting
the apparent intracellular staining from the putative surface staining.
whole cell measurements of ina disclosed that total current was
decreased; however, total measured current is the product of the
number of functional channels (n), single-channel conductance, and
open probability. following the methods of heinemann et al. (16), we
performed nonstationary noise analysis, a validated method to estimate n (25). currents were elicited from a holding potential of ⫺80
mv with a prepulse of ⫺120 mv for 500 ms before the test pulse of
⫺20 mv for 25 ms. myocytes were isolated from 5-day-old neonatal
mice. the rationale for the choice of the 5-day-old neonates relates to
the following: 1) the ␣-myosin heavy chain promoter does not become
robustly active until the first week after birth; 2) round and small cells
allow optimal spatial clamp (⬍25 pf); and 3) our data showed that at
this time the current density of ina was significantly reduced (p ⬍
0.05) without a difference in capacitance between cn and wt mice.
only for noise analysis, [na]o was increased to 30 mm nacl to
increase unitary channel conductance. the concentration of nmg was
reciprocally reduced to 112 mm. the pipette solution for the ina
recording contained (mm) 120 cscl, 20 tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 atp-mg, 0.5 gtp-na2, 5 egta, 10 nacl, 2 cacl2, and 10
hepes (ph 7.2, adjusted with csoh). the pipette resistance was 1–3
m⍀. no capacitance or series resistance compensation was applied.
analyses were performed with custom software developed in mat-

matings were determined by pcr on dna from tail biopsy specimens. for pcr analysis, oligonucleotides for the human growth
hormone sequence (5⬘-gtctgactaggtgtccttct-3⬘; 5⬘cgtcctcctgctggtatag) were used (18). the pcr conditions
were as follows: denaturation at 95°c for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 1 min at 94°c, 1 min at 60°c, and 1 min at 72°c.
aps and sodium currents. voltage-dependent sodium currents (ina)
and aps were measured in isolated ventricular cardiac myocytes with
conventional patch-clamp methods in either voltage- or current-clamp
configuration (11). a rapid solution changer (solution change ⬍2 s)
was used to expose the myocytes to a low-extracellular sodium
concentration ([na]o) solution (10 mm) just before application of the
voltage-clamp pulses. all experiments were performed at room temperature. an axopatch 200b (axon instruments) amplifier was used.
access resistance was ⬍5 m⍀. series resistance was routinely compensated to ⬎80% (11). capacitive transients were minimized by
capacitance compensation and then digital subtraction. the current
was filtered with a low-pass bessel filter at 5 khz and digitalized at
a rate of 10 khz. the peak transient current between its onset and up
to 60 ms was measured as the amplitude of ina. the membrane
potential was held at ⫺120 mv. test pulses of 60-ms duration were
applied from ⫺90 to ⫹50 mv in 5-mv increments with 5 s between
pulses. voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation of ina was measured by applying paired pulses. the conditional pulse was 5 s in
duration and varied from ⫺130 to ⫺25 mv, which was followed by
a test pulse of ⫺25 mv. the inactivation curves were fitted to the
boltzmann equation:

results

aps and ina. the time course to development of cardiac
hypertrophy of the individual ventricular myocytes was assessed by measuring their capacitance at 14, 28, and 42–50
days of life (table 1). the capacitance of cn ventricular
myocytes increased significantly from age 14 to age 28 days,
but there was no significant change thereafter. cn myocyte
values at all developmental times were significantly greater
than those in wt myocytes. this is in keeping with previous
studies measuring cardiac mass index and wall thickness with
two-dimensional echocardiography (14, 31).

mice and the time course of change in mean ap characteristics

observed (anova). in cn mice, progressive time-dependent
decreases in the overshoot potential and dv/dtmax of phase 0,
and increases in excitability threshold were noted. the ap
features of cn myocytes were compared to those of ttxtreated (5 ␮m) wt cells (fig. 1a, right). in cn ventricular
myocytes at 42–50 days, the changes in overshoot potential,
dv/dtmax of phase 0, and excitability threshold were similar to

lab (coherent therapeutics, calgary, ab, canada). using 5 successive leak records (hyperpolarized to ⫺100 mv from ⫺80 mv) to
correct 60 successive test records, we determined the mean current as
a function of time. using successive difference records, we estimated
current variance as a function of time. finally, using the effective
variance least-squares fitting method of orear (25) to analyze the plot
of ensemble current variance as a function of mean current, we
estimated n. a correlation time of 0.8 ms was estimated by autocovariance function centered at the time of peak current.
in vivo relevance of decreased activity of ina density to heart block
phenotype. surface ecgs were recorded in conscious, unsedated mice
(34). signal-averaged ecgs were obtained by aligning all normal
sinus rhythm cardiac cycles to a common point in the ecg waveform.
to do this, we created software in matlab designed to perform a
wavelet transform of the ecg using the second derivative of the
gauss function as our wavelet [gauss support (⫺5,5) and wavelet
scale ⫽ 25 ms]. each r wave produced a large-magnitude, local
minimum in the wavelet transform space that could be easily localized
with a threshold. the ecg for each cardiac cycle was defined as the
voltages within a sampling window starting 35 ms before the first r
wave and ending 35 ms before the next r wave. through this process,
the mean of the compiled cycles for each 60-s recording was calculated.
to assess the heart rhythm disturbances that caused the spontaneous scds, telemeters were chronically implanted and spontaneous
scd was observed in older free-roaming animals. the scd occurred
at least 1 wk (median 8 wk) after implantation of the telemeter, and
the mice were not on any medications. to assess the morphological
precursors of spontaneous heart block, repetitive episodes of the onset
of heart block were superimposed and signal averaged with custom
software in matlab (coherence therapeutics). the fiduciary point
of the qrs for each sinus beat just prior to heart block was defined by
a wavelet transform.
to further explore the pathophysiological role of profound downregulation of ina in the heart block phenotype in vivo, we assessed the
incidence of heart block leading to scd before and after  xxxd1991xxx 
treatment (20 mg/kg ip) in mice at 28 days of age, a time at which
spontaneous sudden deaths only rarely occur in this transgenic mouse
model. the rationale for the use of  xxxd1991xxx  relates to the cardiac
arrhythmia suppression trial (cast) study, in which  xxxd1991xxx 
induced sudden cardiac deaths in humans (1, 6, 15, 33). moreover,
300 –1,000 nm concentrations of  xxxd1991xxx  selectively block the
cardiac sodium channel, with minimal effect on other cardiac currents
(7, 8).  xxxd1991xxx  does inhibit the delayed rectifier current (ikr) but
only at high (micromolar) concentrations (12). in addition, we previously reported (11) that dofetilide, the selective ikr channel blocker,
never caused sudden death in this transgenic model. although the
more specific sodium channel blocker ttx was used in vitro, it is not
possible to use ttx in vivo, since ttx blocks the neuronal sodium
channels at nanomolar concentrations but the cardiac sodium channels
only at micromolar concentrations (12). thus, if ttx had been given
in vivo to mice, only neurological responses would have been seen.
moreover, ttx would have compromised neural regulation of breathing, which would have confounded any in vivo result.

those seen in ttx-treated wt cells. these data were consistent with the possibility of downregulation of sodium channels
in these mice.
the time course of changes in the ap characteristics parallel
the survival curves of these mice. in a previous study (11), we
reported the kaplan-meier survival curves of cn and wt
mice. scds began to occur at 3 wk of age. the rate of
development of scd was nearly linear thereafter. between 3
and 7 wk of life, ⬃25% of the cn mice died of scd. no
deaths occurred in the wt mice (n ⫽ 40) over this time course.
to assess whether decreases in sodium current density
underlie the decrease in dv/dtmax of phase 0 of the aps, ina was
recorded. representative examples of the families of sodium
channel current records elicited by the protocol are shown in
fig. 2a: wt on the left and cn on the right. figure 2b shows
mean current-voltage relationships, comparing wt to cn at 28
days (n ⫽ 5 each). peak current density is significantly reduced. to assess whether shifts in the current-voltage relationship exist, comparing wt to cn, currents were normalized to
the peak current and the results are plotted in fig. 2a (inset).
the normalized current-voltage relationships are similar in
both wt and cn mice, with the peak current developing at a
voltage of ⫺30 mv. thus the character of the current-voltage
relationship of the residual currents in cn mice is similar to
that seen in wt mice. figure 2c shows the progressive
time-dependent changes in ina density at various times during
development. at 42–50 days, ina was virtually abolished.
these data indicate that decrease in ina is responsible for the
decrease in dv/dtmax of the aps.
to assess whether shifts in steady-state inactivation could
contribute to the observed decrease in sodium current density,
steady-state inactivation properties were evaluated in myocytes
from 28-day-old mice. steady-state inactivation was assessed
with the protocol illustrated in fig. 2d (inset). in cn mice,
steady-state inactivation was shifted by 3 mv in the hyperpolarizing direction compared with wt mice [nonsignificant
(ns)]. if the myocyte had a physiological resting potential of
⫺80 mv, ⬃60% of the sodium channels would be available for
activation in cn mice, whereas 70% of the channels would be
available in wt mice. these data indicate that shifts in steadystate inactivation could only contribute modestly to the measured downregulation of the peak density of ina.
to assess whether changes in recovery from inactivation
could contribute to the observed decrease in current density,
recovery properties were evaluated. recovery from inactivation was assessed with the protocol illustrated in fig. 2e. the
mean time course of recovery was compared in wt vs. cn
mice (28 days). no significant change in the time course of
recovery from inactivation was noted. since only minimal
changes in steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation of ina were observed and since ina is virtually abolished
in 50-day-old cn mice, it is likely that changes in density of
ina were related to changes in n.
nonphysiological conditions (e.g., [na]o of 10 mm) were
required to biophysically estimate ina density in ventricular
myocytes. to record ina under more physiological [na]o conditions (145 mm), the density of the ttx-sensitive ina was
measured at potentials in proximity to its reversal potential of
⫹45 mv in the smaller atrial cells from wt and cn mice (fig.
2, f and g). the slope of the current-voltage relationship
should measure whole cell ina conductance. in wt myocytes

d). as expected, the changes in ina were paralleled by changes
in dv/dtmax. these data indicate that this rescue of the decreased density of ina has physiological relevance.
to further explore whether changes in intracellular calcium
concentration could mediate a downregulation of ina by activation of pkc, we assessed whether chronic (5 h) in vitro
treatment with the pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  (100
nm) would rescue the downregulation of ina. figure 4a shows
that  xxxd2195xxx  rescues ina density and dv/dtmax to
values indistinguishable from those in wt cells.  xxxd2195xxx  has no effect on wt cells (fig. 4b). these data,
taken in concert, indicate that overexpression of calcineurin
alters calcium homeostasis, leading to activation of pkc,
which results in a decrease in activity of the sodium channel.
the effects of  xxxd2195xxx  on density of ina are
paralleled by changes in dv/dtmax (fig. 4, c and d).
next, we recorded the characteristics of the pattern of
beating of the spontaneous aps in neonatal myocytes overexpressing calcineurin vs. wt myocytes. figure 5 shows representative examples. myocytes overexpressing calcineurin consistently showed erratic beating patterns, with abrupt slowing
(n ⫽ 18). importantly, treatment with ryanodine and  xxxd2195xxx  (n ⫽ 7) reproducibly reversed this phenotype
to a regular beating pattern, similar to that seen in wt myocytes.
to confirm that the pharmacological treatments would produce qualitatively similar results in adult myocytes, cells were
isolated from 14-day-old wt and cn mice. after collagenase
dispersion, cells were cultured for 24 h. however, after 24 h of
culture, the normally clear margins of the cn cells had blurred,
the ends of the myocytes rounded up, and their resting potentials were depolarized. accordingly, for subsequent studies

at 28 days the conductance was 5.9 ⫾ 0.06 ns/pf, whereas in
cn myocytes it was 1.4 ⫾ 0.14 ns/pf (n ⫽ 3 each). these data
provide confirmation of the measurements of ina recorded in
the traditional manner.
molecular mechanism of decrease in sodium channel expression by calcineurin. infection of neonatal cardiac myocytes with an adenovirus that overexpresses constitutively
active calcineurin significantly decreased density of ina to a
magnitude similar to that seen in adult cardiac myocytes
freshly isolated from these transgenic mice (fig. 3a). since
previous studies indicate that calcineurin can modulate ryanodine receptor function (2, 4), we assessed whether strategies
designed to alter intracellular calcium homeostasis could rescue the downregulation of ina. accordingly, we assessed the
ability of chronic (24 h) in vitro treatment with ryanodine (10
nm), bapta-am (10 ␮m), and thapsigargin (1 ␮m) to rescue
the downregulation of ina. figure 3a shows mean density of
ina (pa/pf). all of these treatments rescued ina density to a
value indistinguishable from that in wt cells. importantly,
these treatments had no effect on wt cells (fig. 3b). thus the
effects of these drugs were specific to cells overexpressing
calcineurin, but not to wt cells. to assess the physiological
relevance of these changes in ina, the dv/dtmax of phase 0 was
evaluated in spontaneous aps in separate cells (fig. 3, c and

4 h. qualitatively, the mean current density of the wt cells
was 25 ⫾ 7 pa/pf in mean 69-pf cells, whereas in cn
myocytes it was 1.5 ⫾ 0.7 pa/pf in mean 103-pf cells(p ⬍

6 pa/pf, respectively. the qualitative effect of the pharmacological treatments in adult cardiac myocytes was similar but
quantitatively less than observed in calcineurin adenovirustreated neonatal myocytes, possibly because of the shorter drug
exposure time.
total cardiac sodium channel protein expression was evaluated with two methods: 1) western blots on whole ventricle
homogenates in 28-day-old wt and cn hearts and 2) immunocytochemistry in neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes infected
with an adenovirus containing constitutively active calcineurin
(provided by j. d. molkentin) vs. a gfp adenoviral control
(fig. 6). the overall results were similar with both methods.

wt and 9.5 ⫾ 0.3 for cn. overexpression of calcineurin has
no gross effects on overall sodium channel protein expression
as assessed by these two techniques.
although western blots and immunocytochemistry evaluate
overall protein expression, they do not necessarily estimate
functional n. accordingly, nonstationary noise analysis was
performed. figure 7 shows representative examples of leakcorrected mean current (fig. 7, top) and ensemble variance
(fig. 7, middle) for wt and cn myocytes as a function of
time. effective variance least-squares fitting (25) for the plot of
ensemble current variance as a function of mean current (fig.
7, bottom) allows estimation of n. in these representative
examples, an estimate of 50,600 functional channels was obtained for the wt myocyte, and an estimate of 19,500 functional channels was obtained for the cn myocyte. mean n
values were 31,000 ⫾ 11,000 in wt myocytes and 10,000 ⫾
9,000 in cn myocytes (n ⫽ 3). this change in functional
channel activity occurred at a time when hypertrophy had not
yet developed; the capacitance values of wt and cn myocytes
were equal.
in vivo relevance of decreased activity of ina to the heart
block phenotype. next, in vivo studies were performed to
provide evidence that the decrease in activity of ina contributed
to the in vivo heart block phenotype. figure 8a shows the in
vitro effects of  xxxd1991xxx  on ina and its corresponding in vivo
effects on qrs duration. as expected,  xxxd1991xxx  produced
concentration-dependent block of the sodium channel in ventricular myocytes from 28-day-old mice (n ⫽ 5 for wt; n ⫽ 4
for cn). at baseline, ina is quite large (⬎10 pa/pf) in wt but
quite small in cn myocytes. after  xxxd1991xxx  treatment (3 ␮m),
the residual current in wt was still significantly greater than
the baseline, drug-free current density in cn mice. importantly, at 3 ␮m, the residual sodium current in cn myocytes
was virtually nonexistent. these in vitro data would predict
that cn mice could have exaggerated responses to  xxxd1991xxx 
when given in vivo. during subsequent in vivo studies, signalaveraged ecgs were obtained during normal sinus rhythm.
figure 8b shows representative examples of the duration of the
qrs in wt vs. cn mice. the qrs duration was obviously and
significantly (p ⬍ 0.001) prolonged by  xxxd1991xxx  in cn mice
(fig. 8b), but  xxxd1991xxx  had much less of an effect in wt (ns).
importantly, fig. 9a shows that in vivo  xxxd1991xxx  treatment
reproducibly triggered heart block in young (28 day old) cn
mice (6/10) but not in wt mice (0/10). the character of the
drug-induced heart block in young cn mice was compared to
the spontaneously occurring episodes in older cn mice (23
wk) (fig. 9b). after acute  xxxd1991xxx  treatment (20 mg/kg ip),
6 of 10 cn mice and 0 of 10 wt mice (p ⫽ 0.01) died because
of asystole. these data indicate that acute treatment with
 xxxd1991xxx  triggers heart block and death in cn mice. the heart
block and asystole after  xxxd1991xxx  treatment are similar to those
seen during spontaneous scd in older cn animals (fig. 9b).

block from telemetry data were superimposed and signal was
averaged with custom software (prospector; coherent therapeutics). figure 10 shows this analysis. figure 10a shows the
mean signal averaged qrs from 244 superimposed and signalaveraged episodes of heart block. the mean qrs values of r1,
r2, and r3 beats are shown, and these qrs complexes are
placed in the context of the onset of heart block in fig. 10b. at
the fiduciary point, the magnitude of the qrs just preceding
heart block was significantly less (p ⬍ 0.0005) than that of the
precursor beats (r1 and r2, fig. 10). no difference is observed
in the p-wave morphology or amplitude before heart block. no
difference is seen in the r-r interval preceding onset of heart
block. these data indicate that the morphological change
occurring in the ecg just before heart block exists only in the
qrs, which abruptly decreases in magnitude just before heart
block. these data point to ion channels that generate the qrs,
dominantly the sodium channel. no significant change in the
qt intervals was observed just before heart block.
the next question addressed was “how can the heart beat
without a sodium channel?” previous studies have reported
slow-response aps whose upstrokes are carried dominantly by
ica-l (3, 17, 19). if this was the situation in cn mice, it would
be expected that excitability would be exquisitely dependent on
catecholamine tone and sudden death might be precipitated by

beta-blocker treatment in older cn mice. propranolol (1 mg/
kg) triggered heart block (asystole) and instantaneous death in
five of six cn animals (aged 17 wk) studied. propranolol had
no effect on heart rhythm in five age-matched wt mice.
discussion

the new information provided by this study includes: 1)
progressive time-dependent decrease in cardiac sodium channel activity occurs in cn mice; 2) decrease in sodium channel
activity occurs by day 5 of neonatal life and precedes the
development of cardiac hypertrophy; 3) the reduction in ina
activity measured in vitro is paralleled by in vivo prolongation
of the qrs width, and decreases in qrs amplitude immediately precede spontaneous episodes of heart block; 4) overexpression of cn alters calcium homeostasis, leading to activation of pkc resulting in decrease in functional sodium channel
activity; 5) abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and pkc
activation are upstream determinants of decreased sodium
channel activity; 6) overall channel protein expression as
measured by western blots and immunocytochemistry is unchanged; and 7) decrease in functional sodium channel activity is
in the common final pathway to heart block (asystole) in cn mice.

ina: common final pathway to heart block

aps and ina: part of the pathway to heart block. decreased
activity of ina was consistently manifest in three separate cell
types: 1) adult cardiac myocytes from cn mice, 2) wt
neonatal cardiac myocytes treated with adenoviral overexpression of calcineurin, and 3) day 5 neonatal myocytes from cn
mice. importantly, the decrease in ina activity in the day 5
neonatal myocytes from cn mice occurred without a significant difference in cell size (compared to wt) as assessed by
capacitance values. therefore, decrease in ina does not appear

to be a nonspecific downstream target secondary to cardiac
hypertrophy. in review, consistent results observed in three
separate cell types confirms that decreased activity of ina is
associated with calcineurin overexpression.
the evidence that decreased activity of ina contributes to the
common final pathway to heart block includes the following. 1)
there is a consistent time course of the decrease in activity of
ina and the development of heart block and asystole in vivo. 2)
sodium channel current activity asymptotes to tiny values

during aging in cn mice, and sodium channel activity is
necessary for cardiac propagation. 3)  xxxd1991xxx , a selective
sodium channel blocker, produces exaggerated block of ina in
vitro and triggers heart block and asystole in vivo in young cn
mice but not in wt mice. this ecg phenotype is identical to
that which occurs during spontaneous scd in older cn mice.
4) adenoviral overexpression of calcineurin in isolated wt
neonatal cardiac myocytes recapitulates the decrease in
activity of ina. 5) the magnitude of the qrs (r3 beat, fig.
10) just preceding heart block is significantly less (p ⬍
0.0005) than in the precursor beats (r1 and r2 beats, fig.
10), indicating that the defect predisposing to heart block
exists in the qrs. 6) our previous study (14) reported that
the pacing cycle length that elicits heart block in cn mice is
well correlated with left ventricular effective refractory
period. activity of ina is an important determinant of excit-

ability and ventricular effective refractory period. 7) previous studies have reported that in the absence of sodium
current, “slow” action potentials can still be elicited with
phase 0 being carried by ica-l (3, 17, 19), but the magnitude
of this current is critically dependent on catecholamines.
blockade of adrenergic maintenance of this “slow” action
potential would be expected to precipitate heart block. in the
present study, the beta-blocker propranolol consistently triggered heart block, asystole, and death in cn mice. 8) in
humans, mutation in the cardiac sodium channel that decreases functional sodium channel activity creates the same
phenotype— heart block (30). probst et al. (26, 27) reported
a splicing mutation that decreases  xxxg2028xxx  gene expression,
leading to hereditary progressive cardiac conduction defect.
9) haploinsufficiency of this  xxxg2028xxx  trait in combination
with aging causes hereditary lenegre heart block. these

potential clinical relevance. previous studies have reported
that calcineurin plays an important role in pathological cardiac
hypertrophy (10, 11, 14, 20, 35). cardiac hypertrophy can lead
to calcium overload due to increases in calcium entry via ica-l
(35), abnormalities of calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (sr), calcium buffering within the sr, and release
from the sr and/or removal from the cell by the sodium/
calcium exchanger. abnormalities of calcium homeostasis can
activate a multitude of downstream targets. one of these
targets is pkc. activation of pkc decreases the activity of ina,
contributing to the heart block phenotype in cn mice. importantly, calcium homeostasis is dynamic. interventions designed
to enhance sequestering and/or buffering of calcium may have
therapeutic activity.
in conclusion, decrease in activity of ina contributes to heart
block and asystole in murine hearts overexpressing calcineurin.

data, taken in concert, provide evidence that decrease in
cardiac sodium channel activity contributes to the common
final pathway to heart block in cn mice. however, it is clear
that the effect on the sodium channel is indirect. the sodium
channel is likely a downstream target for abnormalities in
calcium homeostasis and pkc activation.
molecular mechanism of downregulation of cardiac sodium
channel. chronic (24 h) in vitro treatment with ryanodine,
thapsigargin, and bapta-am rescues the downregulation of
ina seen with overexpression of calcineurin. to further address
whether altered calcium homeostasis could activate downstream signal transduction pathways, we assessed whether the
pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  could rescue the downregulation of ina. cross talk between signal transduction pathways could be mediated by alterations in calcium homeostasis.
the involvement of the pkc pathway as a downstream signaling pathway for calcineurin is in keeping with studies of de
windt et al. (10).
the molecular mechanisms observed in neonatal ventricular
myocytes treated with an adenovirus overexpressing constitutively active calcineurin are qualitatively similar to those observed in primary cultures of myocytes from 14-day-old cn
mice treated with the same pharmacological treatments. thus
the insights into mechanism appear to apply to both kinds of
cells.
in terms of calcium homeostasis, chu et al. (9) reported that
overexpression of calcineurin increased protein expression and
activity of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2⫹-atpase
(serca)2a and increased expression of phospholamban and
its phosphorylation. these biochemical findings were associated with an increase in the ca2⫹ transient amplitude (1.5-fold)
and the rate of ca2⫹ signal decay (2-fold). thus abnormalities
of serca2a and phospholamban cannot explain the result
observed here. calcineurin has been reported to interact with
the ryanodine receptor (4, 19) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
receptor and with the  xxxg798xxx  complex (5, 13). however, the
molecular mechanism by which calcineurin interacts with these
proteins is uncertain, and whether pkc is an upstream mediator of this interaction is also unknown.
previous studies by qu et al. (28) reported that pkc activation decreases functional sodium channel expression. activation of pkc by oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (10 ␮m) decreased the sodium current by ⬃33% at a holding potential of
⫺114 mv and 56% at ⫺94 mv. this reduction in peak current
was partially related to an 8- to 14-mv shift of steady-state
inactivation in the hyperpolarized direction. in the present
study, we found only a modest shift in the steady-state inactivation of ina. in the study by qu et al. (28), single-channel
recordings showed that the probability of channel opening was
reduced by pkc activation but single-channel conductance
was unaffected. murray et al. (21) and shin and murray (32)
also addressed the mechanism of the effects of pkc on
decreased activity of the cardiac sodium channel. their studies
provide evidence that pkc modulates the human cardiac sodium channel by at least two mechanisms, one similar to that
seen with rat brain channels at a conserved serine (residue
1503) involving a conserved putative pkc site and a second
mechanism more specific to the cardiac isoform. importantly,
murray et al. (32) also reported decreased functional sodium
channel activity without a change in overall protein expression
