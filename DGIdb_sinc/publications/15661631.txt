stimulants: use and abuse in the treatment of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder
kevin cf fone1 and david j nutt2
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the most
prevalent childhood developmental disorder and is also of
unclear neurobiological aetiology. however, recent
advances in molecular genetics and brain imaging implicate
dopaminergic hypofunction in the frontal lobes and basal
ganglia in adhd. psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate and
amphetamine, which are potent inhibitors of the dopamine
transporter) are the first choice medication for adhd and have
a good acute efficacy and safety profile when used for this
disorder. whether long-term psychostimulant administration to
adolescents alters neural development and behaviour or
increases the risk of substance abuse is less certain. the
precise molecular mechanism of action of psychostimulants is
beginning to be established. furthermore, preclinical studies
have begun to use lower clinically relevant doses and oral
administration of psychostimulants to determine their longterm effect on development, behaviour and neurochemistry,
which is an important public health issue associated with
chronic medication of adolescents with adhd.

introduction
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the
most prevalent childhood developmental disorder that
www.sciencedirect.com

affects between 3% and 7% of school-age children.
adhd is a chronic condition that severely impairs function both at home and in school, and frequently persists
into adulthood [1,2,3]. two separate classification systems are used internationally to diagnose adhd (termed
hyperkinetic disorder in some countries). in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disease 4th
edition (dsmiv) [4], adhd is characterised by persistent hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention that are
differentially expressed in three subtypes: primarily inattentive, primarily hyperactive/impulsive or combined in
type. however, in the international classification of
diseases 10th edition (icd-10, extensively used in
europe [5]), all three behaviours must be present for
the diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, which thus has
no subtypes. in the uk and us, diagnosis is based on a
structured clinical interview together with symptoms rated
by parents and teachers in different settings (i.e. home,
school and the community) [3] using diagnostic scales.
the aetiology of adhd is unclear. however, estimates
of heritability from twin studies range from 0.5 to 0.9
which, together with a fivefold increase in risk in firstdegree relatives, strongly implicates a genetic component
[6]. although the neurobiological basis of adhd is
unresolved, recent advances in molecular genetics and
brain imaging have improved our understanding of
adhd, and increasing indirect evidence implicates
dopaminergic hypofunction in the frontal lobes and basal
ganglia [7]. early structural magnetic resonance imaging
(mri) used to visualize anatomical changes demonstrated a smaller fronto-basal ganglia network [8] in
adhd, but these changes are not diagnostic. functional
mri studies to detect brain region-specific changes in
blood flow and metabolism resulting from neuronal activity show reduced striatal activation in both children [9]
and adolescents [10] with adhd during performance of
tasks requiring response inhibition. recent single positron emission tomography analysis using the dopamine
(da) transporter (dat) ligands [123i]altropane and
[tc-99min]trodat-1 to detect dopaminergic neuronal
activity suggests that a marked increase in striatal dat
levels exists in patients with adhd [11,12]. however,
one group failed to replicate this finding in just nine
adults with adhd [13]. an increase in dat levels would
be predicted to result in greater clearance of da from the
synapse and hence a relative deficiency of this neurotransmitter. there is, however, considerable debate as
to whether increased dat levels reported in imaging
studies causes a reduction in synaptic da or whether
elevated da triggers the rise in dat levels [1].

no single gene abnormality reliably predicts adhd but
consistent association occurs between polymorphisms in a
40 base pair variable tandem nucleotide repeat in the 30 untranslated region of the human  xxxg2149xxx  gene and the da
 xxxg658xxx  7 repeat allele [6]. furthermore, psychomotor stimulants such as methylphenidate (ritalin) and
dexamphetamine (adderall), which are potent dat inhibitors, are first-line medication for non-comorbid adhd.
positron emission tomography imaging with a da d2
receptor radioligand, [12c]raclopride, shows that oral
administration of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate
increases synaptic da levels sufficiently to displace striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in the human brain [14] and
causes greater striatal da release during more highly
motivated tasks [15], consistent with the role of da in
attention.
the psychostimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine are the drugs of choice for adhd, providing clinical
benefit against the three core symptoms in 70–80% of
patients in all age groups [3,16]. development of slowrelease preparations has addressed the problematic short
half-life (2–5 h) of original preparations. however, occasional marked side effects (including loss of appetite,
insomnia and, less commonly, motor tics) and rebound
symptoms following rapid drug withdrawal makes the
development of alternative medication desirable. the
psychostimulant pemoline is no longer recommended
as a treatment because of hepatic toxicity. the a2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine is used, particularly in adhd
with comorbid conditions, but is associated with more
severe side effects, such as sedation. tricyclic antidepressants are considered as second-choice drugs for
adhd but are less effective than psychostimulants
and less frequently used because of potential cardiotoxicity [3,16,17]. the antidepressant buproprion has few
adverse effects but is mainly prescribed for comorbid
adhd and depression [17].
although the acute effects of methylphenidate on
human and animal behaviour are well established, fewer
reports have documented longer-term effects or benefits. furthermore, the consequence of repeated psychostimulant administration to adolescent animals or
humans on brain development is poorly understood.
given the progressive increase in the prescription of
psychostimulants for adhd, there is an urgent need to
better understand their potential long-term adverse
effects and molecular mechanisms of action, which are
herein reviewed.

psychostimulant treatment — use and abuse
diagnosis of adhd in young children is difficult because
the characteristic behaviours are common daily events in
this age group, and there is no specific clinical feature or
any confirmatory biological marker. there is considerable
debate among psychiatrists as to whether many cases of
current opinion in pharmacology 2005, 5:87–93

adhd go untreated. in a sample of 1422 adolescents in
north carolina, one-quarter of those confirmed to have
adhd according to dsmiii criteria were not receiving
drug therapy and more than half receiving stimulants
failed to meet the diagnostic criteria [18], suggesting a
considerable mismatch between symptoms and medication. however, the revised criteria for adhd and hyperkinetic disorder in dsmiv and icd-10 classification
systems, respectively, require a pervasive impairment
in psychological development (occurring in two or more
life settings), which has improved diagnostic consistency
[19].
almost 200 randomized controlled clinical trials have
confirmed the efficacy and safety of the range of psychostimulants used to treat adhd. however, a major concern
of repeated use of psychostimulants is whether this
increases the risk of individuals turning to substance
abuse in later life. the oral, rather than the intravenous,
route of administration of methylphenidate limits abuse
potential owing to the lower bioavailability and increased
(first-pass) metabolism. in addition, the slower brain entry
seen with oral preparations reduces the onset of dat
blockade and the rate of elevation of extracellular da
measured by microdialysis in rats [20]. in addition, the
newer longer-acting formulations of methylphenidate
(e.g. concerta and  xxxd2615xxx ) are designed to give slower
regulated release during the day, further attenuating
acute effects. with intravenous administration in rats,
dogs and primates, methylphenidate maintains high rates
of self-administration comparable with amphetamine and
cocaine, and methylphenidate can substitute for intraperitoneal or subcutaneous cocaine in rat drug discrimination
studies [21]. however, with oral methylphenidate administration, most human studies show no preference in
double-blind tablet choice procedures over placebo or
no drug, and much lower subjective ratings of drug effect
are seen than with amphetamine [21]. this is consistent
with the low levels of drug abuse reported in adhd
patients on psychostimulants [17]. indeed, one recent
meta-analysis found that untreated adhd adolescents
were at a twofold higher risk of developing drug abuse
[22] than were those on medication, suggesting that
previous exposure to methylphenidate may reduce the
subsequent risk of abuse of stimulant drugs. this might
be explained by an improved school performance leading
to less exclusion, less criminal activity and greater feelings of self-worth. it is also possible that the presence of
methylphenidate in the brain reduces the effects of illicit
stimulants or other drugs. the diversion of prescribed
psychostimulants to adolescents not suffering from
adhd is another area of concern, but there is little
quantitative information on this topic [21]. one area of
current concern is that the methylphenidate capsule
might be opened and the contents taken intra-nasally
(‘snorted’) to get a ‘rush’ as a consequence of faster brain
entry.

pharmacological mechanism of action of
psychostimulants — dat or net inhibition?
as discussed above, dopaminergic hypofunction in the
frontal cortex and basal ganglia is thought to be a neurobiological feature of adhd, and several imaging studies show that this can be reversed by methylphenidate
[4]. although both cocaine and methylphenidate elicit
conditioned place preference in dat gene knockout
mice, this does not occur in dual dat and serotonin
reuptake transporter (sert) gene knockout mice [23].
this implies that the rewarding effect of psychostimulants is not entirely dependent upon da mechanisms but
might also involve serotonin. in fact, methylphenidate is a
potent inhibitor in vitro of the noradrenaline transporter
(net) and not sert, and enhances rat hippocampal
noradrenaline (ne) to an extent comparable to that of
striatal da in microdialysis studies following intraperitoneal injection [24]. furthermore, oral administration of a
low dose of methylphenidate preferentially enhances
hippocampal ne efflux without affecting da in the
nucleus accumbens [25]. these data are consistent with
the proposal that enhanced noradrenergic neurotransmission, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, contributes to
the in vivo effects of methylphenidate [2]. congruent
with this idea, the selective net inhibitor atomoxetine
(table 1) is an effective treatment for adhd [26,27]
and the a2-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine (which is
occasionally prescribed and can be effective in children
with adhd [28]) enhances regional cerebral blood flow
in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing spatial
working memory tasks [29]. unfortunately, no highaffinity ligands are available to visualize net in the
human brain, making it difficult to evaluate its relevance
to adhd. however, there are few dat transporters in
the prefrontal cortex and it has been suggested that da
uptake in this brain area may occur via net. this would
explain the efficacy of net inhibitors in adhd, which

may increase da levels in the prefrontal cortex where it is
most beneficial.
although both methylphenidate (a piperidine) and
amphetamine (a  xxxd2901xxx ) are classed as
psychostimulants, their pharmacological mechanisms of
action differ considerably. methylphenidate blocks the
monoamine reuptake transporters (i.e. dat, net and
sert) by interaction from the external surface of the
neurone but is not a substrate for transport. although
amphetamine interacts with the transporter substrate
recognition site on dat, methylphenidate binds to a
distinct (but possibly overlapping) site that has high affinity
for cocaine [30]. in addition, unlike methylphenidate,
amphetamine also crosses the cell membrane through
transport and diffusion, enabling interaction with the
vesicular  xxxg2099xxx -2 ( xxxg2099xxx -2) responsible
for sequestration of cytoplasmic da. through this
mechanism, amphetamine displaces vesicular da and
activates release of newly synthesized intraneuronal monoamine by reverse transport. this latter process, unlike
dat inhibition, occurs independent of cell firing rate
and can bypass the normal autoregulatory processes
[31]. this results in a more rapid build-up of synaptic
monoamine with amphetamine compared with methylphenidate, particularly after oral administration, and might
account for the reduced abuse liability of methylphenidate.

long-term effects of psychostimulants
numerous animal studies have examined the acute
effects of methylphenidate on behaviour and neurochemistry. in the rat, both methylphenidate and amphetamine
increase da (and ne) levels in all major terminal areas
[24], including the nucleus accumbens and other areas of
the brain reward circuitry, characteristic of drugs with
abuse liability. but is abuse potential a real risk with
chronic administration in humans? in the adult rodent,

repeated methylphenidate does not cause any persistent
change in monoamine or  xxxg2099xxx  levels
[32,33]. indeed, pre-treatment of rats for one hour with
methylphenidate (4 mg/kg ip bi-daily for four days)
increases [3h]da uptake,  xxxg2099xxx -2 ligand ([3h]dihydrotetrabenazine) binding and  xxxg2099xxx -2 levels in rat striatal
vesicles ex vivo [34]. acute methylphenidate also protects
against the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine by
reducing intracellular da accumulation [35]. by contrast,
withdrawal following five days of amphetamine (5 mg/kg
ip for five days) is accompanied by a 20–40% upregulation
of dat mrna in the rat substantia nigra and ventral
tegmental area lasting up to 14 days [36], implying that
compensatory dat protein proliferation occurs. this
feature might explain the symptoms of ‘crash’ following
amphetamine discontinuation, as increased dat would
lead to reduced dopamine in the synapse. however, the
long-term effect of psychostimulants on behaviour is
controversial and is dependent upon age, dose and route
of administration, as discussed below. most groups report
sensitisation of locomotor behaviour (involving mesolimbic/nucleus accumbens da), and in particular stereotype
(involving nigro-striatal da) behaviour [24,37], with
repeated methylphenidate administration in adult rats.
this sensitisation appears to increase with intermittent
dosing regimens and longer withdrawal periods [38], and
may require longer abstinence periods in young rats [39].
other groups have reported no change but strain differences might partially account for these apparent disparities in the effect of repeated methylphenidate [40].
however, locomotor sensitisation (a common feature of
drugs that enhance reward seeking) tends to require
administration of relatively high doses of methylphenidate (>10 mg/kg ip [37,39]), which is of questionable
clinical relevance (therapeutic doses being 0.3–1.0 mg/
kg po). unfortunately, few animal studies have attempted
to correlate plasma and brain levels of psychostimulants
with behavioural outcomes following different routes of
administration to enable comparison with human data
(see [20]).
subcutaneous injection of adolescent mice for seven days
(from postnatal day 26) with methylphenidate (2.5–
80 mg/kg) caused no subsequent change in performance
in open field, elevated plus maze or spatial learning
paradigms [41]. however, a longer methylphenidate
treatment for 15 days (2 mg/kg ip bi-daily with a 4 h
interval) produced enduring behavioural changes in the
rat [42]. pre-exposure of young rats to low doses of
methylphenidate (2–4 mg/kg for four to seven days starting at postnatal day 28–35) is associated with increased
self-administration of cocaine [38], attenuation of stimulated striatal da release [33] and reduced ventral tegmental da neuronal firing [43] after 1–2 weeks of
withdrawal. these effects are consistent with increased
addiction liability following treatment of young rats,
which might be relevant to the abuse potential of methylcurrent opinion in pharmacology 2005, 5:87–93

phenidate in humans. moll et al. [44] found no persistent
reduction of striatal dat density when methylphenidate
was given after puberty, but they did find a marked
progressive reduction in dat density (by 70%) in 70day-old rats following prepubertal administration of
methylphenidate (2 mg/kg/d for two weeks). interestingly, the effects of methylphenidate on the immediate
early gene c-fos are also age dependent. methylphenidate
increased striatal c-fos expression in mice if given on
postnatal day 3 or 7 but not on postnatal day 24 or 45
[45]. furthermore, twice daily injection of rats with
methylphenidate for 15 days produces sustained elevation of camp response element binding protein (creb)
in the nucleus accumbens [46]. as fos and creb are
transcription factors, alteration in their expression could
trigger long-term changes in protein expression, mesolimbic da function and, ultimately, behaviour following
repeated methylphenidate [42]. there are clearly many
problems in extrapolating the effect of short-term administration of stimulants in rodents to potential effects in
humans receiving medication for many years, as elegantly discussed recently [47]. nonetheless, it raises
the possibility that the risk of developing substance
abuse may be greater in younger children prescribed
psychostimulants.

future alternatives to psychostimulants
psychostimulants have been the sole drug group of choice
for adhd therapy for many years but several non-stimulant medications have recently been developed. the
most extensively studied, and the only non-stimulant
medication available on prescription in the us, is atomoxetine (strattera; ()-n-methyl-g(2-methylphenoxy)benzenepropamine hydrochloride; ly139603) [26,27].
in vitro binding studies show that atomoxetine is a selective ne reuptake inhibitor, having a relative potency of
inhibition in cell lines expressing recombinant human
net, dat and sert of 1:15:290 (table 1). despite
this, atomoxetine causes a threefold increase in both ne
and da overflow in the rat prefrontal cortex in microdialysis studies [48], and so an indirect effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission (or even a direct action on
dat in vivo) might contribute to its therapeutic actions
in adhd.
in two recent studies, acute or short-term administration
of the novel alerting agent modafinil (provigil, a form of
stimulant licensed for the treatment of disorders of daytime sleepiness such as narcolepsy) has been shown to
enhance performance of adhd patients to a similar
extent as amphetamine [49] and improve short-term
memory span, visual memory and response inhibition
tasks by reducing impulsivity [50]. although the pharmacological mechanism of action of modafinil is unclear, it
may enhance histamine release or affect a1-adrenoreceptor function without affecting dopaminergic activity.
these features could lead to an improved side effect

profile and reduced abuse liability. further long-term
placebo-controlled clinical trials with modafinil in adhd
will clearly be of interest.

the relative potencies of the various psychostimulant
medications on dat, net and sert might be important predictors of their acute effects on behaviour. however, more subtle differences in their effects on  xxxg2099xxx -2
and monoamine storage are also evident. the molecular
mechanisms underlying long-term alterations produced
by psychostimulants are also beginning to be unravelled,
and changes in transcription factors, such as fos and
creb, could trigger enduring changes in protein expression and (potentially) neuronal function and behaviour.
there are clearly many problems extrapolating the effect
of relatively short-term administration of psychostimulants in rodents to the potential effect in humans receiving intermittent medication for many years. nonetheless,
evidence suggests that a low dose of methylphenidate
administered by the oral route probably has a low risk of
abuse liability, but increasing evidence points to a greater
potential impact in adolescent animals. the results from
long-term placebo-controlled clinical trials of novel alternatives to psychostimulant medication for adhd will be
of great interest.

a review of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and clinical studies
performed with the selective ne reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. initial
clinical reports suggest that atomoxetine has a similar efficacy, side effect
profile and discontinuation rate to methylphenidate. however, few longterm studies have been performed to evaluate any drug abuse or adverse
effects associated with atomoxetine.

an overview from lilly research laboratories on the pharmacology and
clinical trials performed with atomoxetine. in six acute double-blind
placebo-controlled paediatric studies, there was an 8–10 point improvement using the adhd rating scale iv (maximal score being 54) over the
placebo baseline rating within two to fours weeks of treatment onset. in a
total of 3294 child and adolescent adhd patients studied for up to two
years, approximately 5% discontinued treatment, most commonly
because of insomnia.

following withdrawal from repeated administration of a low (2 mg/kg ip)
dose of methylphenidate to 28-day-old (adolescent) rats for either three
days or two weeks, there was an increase or decrease in basal firing rate
of ventral tegmental dopaminergic neurones, respectively, recorded in
chloral hydrate anesthetised rats. however, there was no change in
sensitivity to the d2 da receptor agonist quinpirole after either withdrawal
period, suggesting that this effect on firing rate was not caused by
alterations in da autoreceptor function. the authors discuss the relevance of these dopaminergic changes to the risk of increased addiction
liability after exposure of adolescent rats to methylphenidate.
