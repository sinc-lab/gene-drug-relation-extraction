abstract
in the heterocellular toad skin epithelium the h-adrenergic receptor agonist  xxxd2401xxx  activates  xxxd1773xxx -dependent cl channels
that are not located in the principal cells. with four experimental approaches, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the signalling
pathway targets  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) – chloride channels of mitochondria-rich cells. (i) serosal
application of  xxxd2401xxx  (log10ec50 =  7.1 f 0.2; hill coefficient = 1.1 f 0.2), as well as noradrenaline, activated an anion pathway with
an apical selectivity sequence, gcl>gbrzgno3>gi, comparable to the published selectivity sequence of cloned human cftr expressed in
xenopus oocytes. (ii) known modulators of human cftr,  xxxd2215xxx  (200 amol/l) and genistein (50 amol/l), depressed and activated,
respectively, the receptor-stimulated gcl. genistein did not modify the anion selectivity. (iii) transcellular voltage clamp studies of single
isolated mitochondria-rich cells revealed functional h-adrenergic receptors on the basolateral membrane. with f 60,000 mitochondria-rich
cells per cm2, the saturating activation of 11.9 f 1.6 ns/cell accounted for the measured  xxxd2401xxx -activated transepithelial conductance of
600 – 900 as/cm2. in  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cells,  xxxd2215xxx  (200 amol/l) reversibly inhibited the transcellular conductance by 9.6 f 1.6
ns/cell. (iv) with primers constructed from cloned xenopus cftr and pcr amplification of reverse-transcribed mrna from toad skin, fulllength bufo cftr cdna was generated. the derived protein of 1466 residues shows 86% homology with xcftr and 89% homology with
hcftr. all major functional sequences, that is, the r- and the nbf1- and nbf2-domains are well-conserved as are the predicted
transmembrane segments proposed to form the pore of the channel protein. these new results taken together with our previously identified
small-conductance cftr-like cl channel in the apical membrane of the mitochondria-rich cells lead to the conclusion that the toad’s cftr
gene codes for a functional cl channel in the apical plasma membrane of this minority cell type.

1. introduction
the function and regulation of the  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) chloride channel
[1] have been studied extensively in mammalian epithelia
[2]. the protein is expressed in the apical membrane, and
following  xxxd1773xxx -dependent phosphorylation of the rdomain cytosolic atp activates channel activity [3 – 5].
phosphorylation by the  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) catalytic
subunit was indicated in studies of native cells [6] and
cultures expressing native [7,8] or cloned [9] human cftr.
in vivo, the formation of the second messenger  xxxd1773xxx 
is controlled by, e.g., stimulation of h-adrenergic receptors

on the basolateral membranes of the epithelium. this
scheme seems to be applicable to several mammalian
epithelia like ducts of sweat glands [8,10], upper airways
[11], intestine [12], ducts of the exocrine pancreas [13], and
male reproductive tracts [14]. likewise, salt secretion by
epithelia of lower vertebrates such as shark rectal gland
[15,16], gills of marine teleosts [17,18] and frog subepidermal gland [19 – 21] depends on  xxxd1773xxx -regulated
cftr. the absorbing chloride cells and small intestine of
the freshwater-adapted euryhaline teleost, fundulus heteroclitus, also expresses cftr. however, in contrast to the
seawater-adapted fundulus, the channel protein in the
freshwater-adapted fish is localized to the basolateral membrane [18]. the purpose of the present study is to investigate
a previously identified h-adrenergic receptor-regulated chloride conductance of the skin of anuran amphibia, which
was hypothesized to be located in mitochondria-rich cells of

e.h. larsen et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1618 (2003) 140–152

the nacl- and fluid-absorbing epidermis [22]. this was
done by selectivity and pharmacological analysis of the
activated channel of the intact epithelium, by transcellular
voltage clamp of single isolated mitochondria-rich cells, and
by molecular biological characterization of the putative
channel protein. some of the results have been referred to
in previous review articles [23,24].

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and preparations
toads (bufo bufo) were kept in an indoor (winter) or
outdoor terrarium with free access to a pool of tap water and
fed with mealworms ad lib. for increasing the yield of
mitochondria-rich cells in single-cell studies, toads were
kept for 1 –2 weeks in running distilled water (20 jc). the
animals were killed by double pithing and the skin removed
by dissection. the epithelium was isolated by exposure of
the serosal side of the skin for 2 h at room temperature by a
ringer’s solution containing collagenase at a concentration
of 2 mg/ml (type 2, worthington chemical, nj). single
mitochondria-rich cells were obtained by trypsin treatment
of the isolated epithelium by a method modified from refs.
[25,26]. for 1 h, the isolated epithelium was kept in
collagenase ringer (2 mg/ml, c-9891, ec 3.4.24.3, sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa) and after washing in ca2 +-free

ringer, it was bathed in ca2 +-free trypsin ringer (0.1 mg/
ml, t-4665, ec 3.4.21.4, sigma) and centrifuged for 5 min
at 800– 1200 rpm. the remaining epithelium was transferred to a fresh trypsin solution, while the isolated cells
were washed and stored in nacl ringer’s solution until use.
rounds of 5 min trypsin treatment of the epithelium,
centrifugation, and wash were repeated until the major
fraction of the epithelial cells was isolated. in order to
protect the h-adrenergic receptors from exogenous enzymes,
in all steps of the isolation procedure, the solutions
contained 1 amol/l of the receptor antagonist propranolol.
2.2. experimental setups
for studies of mitochondria-rich cells in situ, the intact
epithelium was mounted in a perspex chamber that could be
perfused continuously on the outside with well-aerated
ringer’s solutions of different compositions as indicated
in the text. isolated cells were transferred to a perspex
chamber with a cover-glass bottom and volume of 300 al.
by gravity force, the chamber was perfused at a rate of
f 85 al/s with a well-aerated solution of desired composition. with the chamber mounted on the table of a nikon
tms inverted microscope (dfa a/s, copenhagen, denmark) the cells were viewed at 40 magnification. by
suction, the neck of a mitochondria-rich cell was positioned
in the tip of a patch clamp pipette (vitrex, modulohm a/s
herlev, denmark) fabricated on a two-step vertical puller
(hans ochotzki, homburg, germany) and polished (mf-90
narishige, tokyo, japan) for obtaining a resistance of 1.2–
1.6 mv (measured with nacl ringer’s in bath and pipette).
2.3. electrophysiological measurements

fig. 1. the protocol for studying the receptor-activated chloride
conductance of collagenase-isolated toad skin epithelium. when mounted
with nacl – ringer’s solution on both sides, the preparation exhibited a
spontaneous transepithelial potential difference, vt =  38 mv. following
short-circuiting (arrows), for monitoring the conductance at intervals of 20
s, vt was clamped to + 20 mv for 2 s. at the arrow indicated ‘kcl’ the
outside of the epithelium was superfused with a solution in which all of the
sodium ions were replaced by potassium ions, which reduced the shortcircuit current as well as the conductance. adding  xxxd2401xxx  to the
serosal solution stimulated the transepithelial conductance leaving isc near
zero.

the transepithelial potential difference, vt, was measured
via calomel electrodes matched to within 1 mv (k401,
radiometer, copenhagen). current was passed across the
preparation via ag/agcl half-cells placed in the chambers. in

three series of experiments were conducted with 5 am  xxxd2401xxx  in the serosal bath (1-iso, 2-iso, and 3-iso, respectively). in the 1-iso group, 100 amol/l
furosemide was contained in the serosal solution. in this one shift to nitrate solution was not included in the protocol (n.d. = not determined).
in the fourth series of experiments, 10 am noradrenalin was added to the serosal bath (noradr).
in the 3-iso group, the conductance was measured by a transepithelial voltage pulse with amplitude, dvt =  20 mv. in the other three groups, the conductance
was determined by dvt = + 20 mv as illustrated in fig. 1.

experiments in which the anion composition of the outside
solution was changed, a platinum wire replaced the ag/agcl
current electrode of the outside chamber. voltage clamping at
vt = 0 mv was performed by a vcc600 amplifier (physiological instruments inc., san diego). the transepithelial
conductance was measured at intervals of 20 s by recording
the current response to a voltage pulse of 20 mvof amplitude
and 2-s duration. the amplifier was interfaced to a powerlab/
8sp a/d converter and the digitized signals processed with
the chart software (adinstruments, castle hill, nsw, australia). single-cell voltage clamp was performed with the
axopatch-200b amplifier interfaced to a digidata 1322a
using pclamp9 for recording and analysis (axon instruments, foster city, ca). currents were low-pass filtered
(20 hz corner frequency, frequency device, ma, usa)
and sampled at a rate of 50 hz.

currents through apical na+ channels, na+ in the outside

epithelia, and 100 amol/l amiloride was added to the pipette
solution in single cell studies. in the anion selectivity study,

2.4. cloning of toad cftr
by sequence comparison of cftr from different species, three primers were generated using xcftr cdna [27]
as template. the primers (mwg-biotech) were designed to
contain restriction endonuclease sites at their 5v-ends, enabling us to clone the fragments into a vector for sequencing. total rna was isolated from belly skin of a toad using
a guanidine thiocyanate-phenol extraction kit from advanced biotechnologies, ltd. onestep rt-pcr (qiagen)
was performed, the pcr products displayed on a 1%
agarose gel and bands were cut out and eluted. the
amplified products was then digested with restriction endonucleases and cloned into the pegfp-c2 vector (clontech),
mini-prepped (qiagen), and sequenced. alignment of
bbcftr with other cftr’s was performed using vector
nti (informax inc.).

200 as/cm2. (b) a similar protocol was applied for the study of the transepithelial conductance with noradrenalin in the serosal bath.

100 and 10 mmol/l dmso, respectively.

3.1. conductance activation of the intact epithelium by
receptor stimulation
routinely, the transport activity of the isolated epithelium
was analysed by monitoring the transepithelial potential
difference (vt) and active sodium current with nacl – ringer’s solution on both sides. fig. 1 shows the standard
protocol applied to a preparation with a steady state
vt =  38 mv and an active na+-current, isc c 40 aa/cm2.
mean values for 49 isolated epithelia are given in table 1.

fig. 4. response of the h-adrenergic receptor-activated cl conductance to
modulators of the activity of cftr cl channels. genistein (50 amol/l)
added to the external perfusion solution resulted in fast stimulation of the
conductance.  xxxd2215xxx  added to the serosal bath at concentration of
amol/l slowly decreased the receptor-activated cl conductance.

mounting of the preparation in the perfusion chamber, the
external side was superfused with a kcl –ringer’s solution,
and at steady state, 5 am  xxxd2401xxx  was added to the
serosal bath. following receptor occupation, the transepithelial conductance increased and attained a quasi-stationary
value in the course of 15 –25 min. application of the agonist
resulted in a significant conductance increase while the
short-circuit current was maintained at a value not significantly different from zero (fig. 1, table 2). this provides
the evidence that the conductance increase is not caused by
stimulation of functional subepidermal glands, which would
generate a significant inward short-circuit current carried by
an active efflux of cl [28,29]. a similar conclusion was
reached in a study with the membrane-permeable dibutyryl
 xxxd1773xxx  analogue, which stimulated the conductance of
amiloride-treated preparations while the short-circuit current
remained zero (isc = 0.1 f 0.3 aa/cm2 with 500 am dbcyclic amp [22]). it is also in agreement with a light
microscopic examination of the collagenase-isolated epithelium, showing that the isolation protocol with collagenase
removes the subepidermal glands leaving their ducts closed

[30]. finally, we will show (table 3) that the activated
conductance is not affected by adding furosemide to the
serosal solution at a concentration which is known to block
subepidermal gland secretion.
binding of the agonist to the h-adrenergic receptor
appears to be governed by second-order reaction kinetics
as revealed by a sigmoid relationship between the logarithm
of the  xxxd2401xxx  concentration (log10[iso]) and the relative conductance activation with a hill-slope near unity
(fig. 2). the full curve in this figure is the best fit of eq.

immediately prior to shift to another external anion (a) and
gav the conductance recorded during exposure to a. calculated in this way, we could take into account that some
preparations exhibited partial ‘desensitization’ as discussed
above. the results are compiled in table 3, which indicate
similar anion-selectivity sequence with  xxxd2401xxx  and
noradrenalin, gcl>gbrzgno3>gi. thus, all four anions
tested permeate the receptor-controlled apical chloride channel. in the majority of experiments, the conductance was
determined by applying a voltage pulse every 20 s across
the epithelium of 2-s duration and 20 mv amplitude (serosal
side grounded, see fig. 1). in the experiments denoted 3-iso
of table 3, the pulse polarity was reversed. the results
indicate that the conductance sequence of the four anions
tested is independent of the direction of the transepithelial
voltage step.

3.2. selectivity of the receptor-activated conductance of the
intact epithelium
the receptor-activated conductance was dependent on
the anion in the external perfusion solution (fig. 3a).
serosal application of noradrenalin resulted in a conductance activation of similar selectivity (fig. 2b). in some
preparations, the activated conductance passed through a
peak value for partially decaying during the subsequent
period of several minutes. examples of this type of ‘desensitization’ are given in figs. 1 and 3b. in other preparations,
a slow monotonous development of the conductance activation was recorded as illustrated in fig. 3a. these types of
responses were recorded both with  xxxd2401xxx  and noradrenalin. with the conductance of the epithelium perfused
on the outside with gluconate –ringer’s solution taken as

a shift of vp from + 50 to  100 mv is composed of an instantaneous
ohmic component (iohmic) and a more slowly developing dynamic
component (icl) with the latter representing activation of the apical cl
conductance [26]. (b) an experiment with a similar protocol but with the

3.3. pharmacology of the receptor-activated conductance of
the intact epithelium
heterologously expressed human cftr-mediated whole
cell currents are reduced by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea
compound,  xxxd2215xxx  [31]. in our preparation of an
anuran epithelium, the addition of this inhibitor at a concentration of 200 amol/l in the serosal solution resulted in a
significant depression of the  xxxd2401xxx -activated transepithelial conductance (figs. 4 and 5). the isoflavone
genistein is a potent kinase inhibitor, which was shown to
enhance the  xxxd1773xxx -activated cftr-mediated cl
secretion in a mammalian cell culture [32,33]. the results
given in figs. 4 and 5 show that 50 amol/l genistein added
post- xxxd2401xxx  stimulated the transepithelial conductance to a value that is significantly above that of the
receptor-activated conductance. by comparing results listed
in tables 3 and 4, it can be seen that the anion conductance
sequence of  xxxd2401xxx  + genistein-stimulated preparations is similar to that of preparations stimulated by  xxxd2401xxx  only.

these two cells and results from one of the cells are shown in
fig. 6b. like in fig. 6a, the transcellular conductance was
activated at  100 mv from a holding potential of 50 mv
(signs referring to apical side). for this cell, icl =  3.4 na.
notably, brief exposure of the apical plasma membrane to a
cl-free solution (gluconate substitution, fig. 6b) reversibly eliminated the non-linear component, which provides
direct evidence that it is carried predominantly by a flux of
cl from the apical to the basolateral side of the mitochondria-rich cell. in the present study, at  100 mv, the cl
currents ranged from  1.2 to  8.5 na/cell (icl =  4.5 f
0.9 na/cell, mean f s.e., n = 10, vp =  100 mv), which is
within the range of currents reported in our previous study
of 31 mitochondria-rich cells [26]. the voltage dependence
of icl obtained in the present study of cells from animals
kept in distilled water (section 2) are summarized in fig.
6c. the chloride currents exhibit a strongly outwardly
rectifying icl/v relationship with vanishing currents for
v z 25 mv. a similar relationship characterizes the cl
currents of the intact epithelium (recently reviewed in ref.

3.4. studies on single mitochondria-rich cells
for investigating the cellular locus of the receptor-controlled cl conductance, we extended the analysis to single
cells. the majority of mitochondria-rich cells has a flasklike or slender cylindrical shape, which is maintained
following isolation while principal cells become spherical
[25]. with low-resistance patch clamp glass electrodes and a
small negative pressure, the ‘neck’ of a mitochondria-rich
cell can be manipulated into the tip of the electrode. in this
configuration, cell currents can be studied by transcellular
voltage clamping [26]. fig. 6a shows that the voltage clamp
current can be resolved in a linear (ohmic) and a non-linear
(time-dependent) component. in the previous study, the
evidence was presented that the latter is carried by cl
[26]. this hypothesis shall be verified below. accordingly,
the non-linear current is denoted, icl. in the example shown
in fig. 6a, a shift of the transcellular electrical potential
difference (vp) from + 50 to  100 mv resulted in a
chloride current of icl =  2.3 na. in two experiments, we
were able to position a mitochondria-rich cell with the apical
membrane in the bath. similar results were obtained with

fig. 8. db- xxxd1773xxx  (250 amol/l) in bath stimulated the chloride currents
at all pipette potentials (  100 mv v vp v 50 mv). the icl/v relationships
were recorded from the same cell before and after the addition of cyclic
amp to bath. it was assumed that the leakage conductance estimated prior
to  xxxd1773xxx  treatment was not affected by the stimulation of the cellular
conductance.

indicates conductance activation prior to  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition (arrow). (b)  xxxd2215xxx  caused a conductance decrease of, dgglib =  9.6 f 1.6 ns
(n = 11, n = 6 cells). following superfusion with  xxxd2215xxx -free ringer’s solution, the conductance returned to a value that was 1.4 f 1.0 ns above the
conductance recorded prior to adding  xxxd2215xxx .

[24]) and of single cells isolated from toads in ion balance
[26].
with cl currents deactivated at vp= + 50 mv,  xxxd2401xxx  stimulated the transcellular conductance (fig. 7, left
hand panel). a similar response was seen in cells clamped at
 100 mv (fig. 7, right hand panel). in one cell, the
response to different agonist concentrations, 10, 50, and
100 nm, was studied. with these three different concentrations, quantitatively similar effects were obtained,
dgiso = 7.2, 7.7, and 7.0 ns/cell, respectively (vp= + 50
mv). this indicates that 50 nm  xxxd2401xxx  represents a
saturating concentration. in 16 experiments with five cells,
the  xxxd2401xxx -induced conductance, dgiso, ranged from
7 to 29 ns/cell with an average of 11.9 f 1.6 ns/cell
(mean f s.e., n = 16). addition of the membrane-permeable
form of  xxxd1773xxx  to the bathing solution also stimulated
the chloride currents at all potentials. this is shown in fig.
8 depicting icl/v relationships for a cell before and after
 xxxd1773xxx  treatment.
the  xxxd1773xxx -activated currents were inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx  at both negative and positive pipette potentials.
as shown in fig. 9a, in cells pretreated with 10 amol/l
 xxxd1742xxx , brief exposure of 200 amol/l  xxxd2215xxx  reversibly reduced the transcellular conductance. in some
cells, a small conductance stimulation preceded the conductance inhibition (arrow fig. 9a). results of 11 experiments
with six cells are summarized in fig. 9b, showing that, on
average,  xxxd2215xxx  reduced the transcellular conductance by 10 ns, which was recovered following wash with
 xxxd2215xxx -free saline. thus,  xxxd2215xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of the targeted ion channel.
3.5. toad skin cftr
by rt-pcr we generated full-length cdna of bbcftr
by homology cloning using three pairs of sequence-specific

primers each spanning about 1500 bp of the cloned xcftr
cdna. the three bands of the reverse-transcribed and
amplified messages (fig. 10) were ligated into a vector for
manual sequencing. the derived amino acid sequence is
given in fig. 11. the bbcftr encodes a 1466 amino acid
protein with homology at protein level of 86% with xcftr
and 89% of hcftr, respectively. with residue numbers
referring to the bbcftr protein, both the r-domain (588 –
864) and the nbf1 (434 – 587) and nbf2 (1227 – 1394)
domains are well-conserved. the predicted transmembrane
segments (underscored in fig. 11) indicate conserved amino

correspond to the 5v, middle, and 3v end of bbcftr, respectively.

4. discussion
4.1. expression of functional cftr in the skin epithelium
in a previous study, we obtained the evidence that
 xxxd2401xxx  acts via a  xxxd1742xxx -activated adenylate cyclase
and  xxxd1773xxx  [22]. for probing the molecular identity of
the receptor-activated  xxxd1773xxx -dependent conductance,
in the present study of the intact isolated epithelium, we
applied three different experimental protocols.

firstly, the selectivity study (fig. 3, table 3) indicated
that the population of channels, which is activated by
receptor occupation, exhibits an anion conductance sequence comparable to the cloned human cftr expressed
in xenopus oocytes, which conducts chloride, bromide, and
iodide as well as nitrate in the following order of efficiency,
gcl>gbrzgno3>gi [34 – 37]. two cell line studies reported
a bromide conductance of human cftr that is similar to
that of chloride [38,39], and in one study, the nitrate
conductance was similar to chloride [38]. thus, there is an
unexplained quantitative variation of this feature of the
cftr channel that may be ascribed to different experimental protocols. there is, however, unanimous agreement
among all of the reported results, including those of our

150

e.h. larsen et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1618 (2003) 140–152

own study, that the three halide ions as well as nitrate
conducts significant currents through the  xxxd1773xxx -dependent population of channels. our results agree with those
of nagel and van driessche [40], who studied the power
density spectrum of  xxxd1742xxx -activated current fluctuations
in the skin of b. viridis. they concluded that the population
of  xxxd1742xxx -activated channels exhibits a voltage-independent ratio of the open/close probability, and conducts
chloride as well as nitrate.
secondly, we investigated the pharmacology of the
receptor-activated conductance by using known cftr
modulators. chloride conductance inhibition by sulfonylureas is generally taken as an indication of cftr channelmediated membrane currents [41]. in a concentration-dependent manner, this reversible inhibitor decreases the open
state probability of the cloned human cftr channel when
studied in a cell-free system [42]. the open state probability
of native anuran cftr residing in the apical membrane of
the subepidermal glands is also reversibly depressed by
application of  xxxd2215xxx  on the cytosolic side of inside–
out patches [21]. the finding that  xxxd2215xxx  significantly reduces the receptor-activated cl conductance of the
gland-free preparation (figs. 4 and 5) provides compelling
evidence for functional expression of anuran cftr in the
absorbing epidermal epithelium. the kinase inhibitor genistein enhanced the  xxxd2401xxx -activated conductance
(figs. 4 and 5). this is compatible with a modulator, which
acts by increasing the open probability of cftr channels in
the plasma membrane. the molecular mechanism of interaction of genistein with cftr is still subject to discussion
[38]. recent evidence suggests that this isoflavone compound may enhance the single channel open state probability of human cftr by binding at nbf2 [43]. the present
finding that the genistein-activated conductance has a selectivity sequence similar to that of cftr (table 4) provides additional evidence for functional expression of cftr
in the apical plasma membrane of the toad skin epithelium.
our third approach was to apply a molecular biological
method for identifying the  xxxd2401xxx  activated anion
channel. using rt-pcr technique, we identified the message of the toad cftr gene in the skin (fig. 10). the
primary structure of the protein derived from the cloned
cdna showed a high degree of identity with human cftr
and xenopus cftr. the functional groups involved in
regulation of the opening of the channel, nbf1, nbf2 and
the r-domain [1], are all well-conserved. of special note, the
predicted residues of the putative pore region of the human
channel protein, which have been hypothesized to confer the
discrimination between anions, e.g., r334, f337, t338, and
s341 [34,44 –47], are also conserved in bbcftr (r330,
f333, t334, and s337, respectively, fig. 11), which is
compatible with our selectivity analysis above (tables 3
and 4). another residue in this region that has been studied
by point mutation is k335 of hcftr, corresponding to r331
of bbcftr (fig. 11). mutation of the basic lysine at this
position of hcftr expressed in hela cells to the acidic

residue,  xxxd2431xxx , resulted in a sequence selectivity shift
from gclfgbr>gi>gf (wild-type) to gbrfgi>gci>gf
(k335e) [38]. our analysis of the  xxxd1773xxx -activated
apical conductance of the toad skin epithelium would suggest that replacement at this position by natural mutation of
lysine by another basic residue, arginine (r331 of fig. 11),
does not have a similar pronounced effect on the halide
conductance selectivity (tables 3 and 4).
4.2. expression of cftr in the apical membrane of
mitochondria-rich cells
in a previous study with double-barreled cl-selective
microelectrodes, we showed that  xxxd2401xxx , as well as
exogenously applied  xxxd1773xxx , evoke a cl conductance,
which is not located in the principal cells of the epithelium
[22]. with this technique applied to another heterocellular
epithelium, the collecting duct of rat kidney, schlatter et al.
[48] arrived at a similar conclusion. the studies presented
here of single isolated mitochondria-rich cells provide the
evidence that the targeted cftr cl channels are in this
cell type. we showed that mitochondria-rich cells express
functional h-adrenergic receptors on their basolateral membrane (fig. 7). similar to the intact epithelium [22,24],
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulated the current through single cells at
both positive and negative transcellular potential differences
(fig. 7). with a receptor-activated conductance of about 12
ns/cell (section 3.4) and f 60,000 mitochondria-rich cells/
cm2 [49] our single cell recordings account for a tissue
conductance of f 700 as/cm2. this number is within the
range of receptor-activated gcl of intact epithelia (600 – 900
as/cm2, table 3). furthermore, the  xxxd1773xxx -activated
transcellular conductance was inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx 
(fig. 9), similar to the chloride conductance of the intact
epithelium (figs. 4 and 5). the inhibition was reversible like
the  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition of the native anuran cftr cl
channel in a cell-free system [20].
following isolation, the cells became more sensitive to
 xxxd2401xxx  (sections 3.1 and 3.4). we have no explanation for this. one reason might be the delayed exposure to
 xxxd2401xxx  of mitochondria-rich cells in situ. as the
ligand would have to diffuse from the serosal bath through
the unstirred layer on the serosal side and the labyrinth of
intercellular spaces of three to four layers of principal cells,
targeted receptors may desensitize before concentration
equilibration is reached. another explanation may be that
the exposure of propranolol for several hours (section 2)
increased their sensitivity to the ligand.
in a patch clamp study, our group identified a f 7 ps
cftr-like cl channel in cell-attached and inside – out
apical membrane patches of mitochondria-rich cells [50].
the frequency of observing this channel almost doubled
after adding  xxxd1742xxx  to the cell preparation. furthermore,
in an immuno-histochemical study with monoclonal antibodies raised against human cftr, it was shown that
epitopes of the highly conserved regions of the r-domain

e.h. larsen et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1618 (2003) 140–152

and c-terminus are expressed exclusively in mitochondriarich cells [23,24].
in conclusion, our studies show that the toad’s cftr
gene codes for a cl channel in the apical membrane of the
mitochondria-rich cells of the heterocellular epithelium.
