hypercholesterolemia is a disease caused by corruption in
cholesterol homeostasis in the whole body, which is maintained by absorption of cholesterol from the gut (1-3),
hepatic cholesterol synthesis (4-6), and the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream via the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor pathway (7-10). endogenous cholesterol is synthesized through the mevalonate (mva) pathway (11), where cholesterol synthesis is regulated by 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis (12).
it is important to determine the activity of whole-body
sterol synthesis to diagnose hypercholesterolemia, and to

evaluate the efficacy of lipid-lowering and anti-atherogenic
drugs. whole-body sterol synthesis has been measured by
means of cholesterol intake/balance methods (13, 14) and
kinetic approaches using labeled cholesterol (15,16). these
methods, however, are complicated and need prolonged
measurement intervals. recently, the blood concentrations
of intermediate molecules of the mva pathway such as
mva (17-19), squalene (20), and lathosterol (21) have been
adopted as good indicators for measuring whole-body sterol
synthesis. jones et al. (22), in particular, have shown that
there is a good correlation between the concentration of
plasma mva and the rate of incorporation of deuterium
into plasma free cholesterol in humans. in addition, parker
et al. (18) and naoumova et al. (23) have reported that

in experimental nnimnln and humans, the concentration of serum mevalonate (mva), a
direct product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase, is considered to reflect the activity of whole-body sterol synthesis. the relationship between
the concentration of serum mva and the activity of sterol synthesis in tissues, however,
has not been fully clarified. in the present study, we examined mva metabolism by using
pravastatin, a liver-selective inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx , and common marmosets,
a good model animal for studying lipid metabolism. in the time course study, the maximal reduction in the concentration of serum mva was observed 2 h after a single oral
administration of 30 mg/kg pravastatin to common marmosets. we, therefore, examined
the relationship between the concentrations of serum and hepatic mva, and sterol synthesis in some tissues at this time point. sterol synthesis was determined ex vivo in tissue slices by measuring the incorporation of [14c]acetate into digitonin-precipitable
[14c]sterols. pravastatin at 0.03-30 mg/kg reduced dose-dependently the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis, whereas no significant reduction of sterol synthesis was observed in
other tissues such as intestine, kidney, testis and spleen, even with the highest dose (30
mg/kg). the liver-specific inhibition of sterol synthesis caused parallel reductions in the
concentrations of both serum and liver mva. in addition, there were good correlations
between the concentration of either serum or hepatic mva and the activity of hepatic
sterol synthesis. these data indicate that the major origin of serum mva is the liver, and
that the concentration of serum mva reflects the concentration of hepatic mva and the
activity of hepatic sterol synthesis 2 h after a single oral administration of pravastatin

materials—pravastatin was prepared as described previously (32, 33). m i-labeled protein a was purchased from
amersham international (amersham, uk). [l-14c]acetate
was obtained from new england nuclear (boston, ma,
usa). all other chemicals were from sigma chemical (st.
louis, mo, usa) or wako pure chemical industries
(osaka).
animals—male common marmosets (25cmo0 g) were
purchased from charles river japan (kanagawa). the animals were housed individually in stainless steel hanging
cages in a temperature- and light-controlled room flights on
from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.), and had free access to water
and a normal commercial chow diet (md-7; funabashi
farm, chiba) (28). animal experiments were carried out
according to the guidelines provided by the institutional
animal care and use committee ofsankyo (tokyo).
administration of pravastatin—the present study consisted of two different experiments. in the first experiment,
we examined changes in the concentrations of serum mva
and total cholesterol after a single oral administration of 30
mg/kg pravastatin to common marmosets. in this experiment, the common marmosets were divided into 2 groups
(n = 6) with comparable concentrations of mean serum
mva levels determined 7 days before the initiation of the
drug administration. blood was withdrawn to determine
the initial values and then pravastatin was administered to
the common marmosets at 9:00 a.m. blood was withdrawn
from a femoral vein at the indicated time-points after the
drug administration. over the experimental period, the
common marmosets were fasted.
in the second experiment, the common marmosets were
divided into 5 groups (n = 5) based on the serum mva concentrations determined 7 days before initiation of the drug
administration as described above. after blood sampling
from a femoral vein to determine the initial values, pravastatin was orally administered once to these animals at the
dose of 0.03, 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg. two hours after the pravastatin administration, blood was withdrawn again, and
then the marmosets were sacrificed under anesthesia with

40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (i.p.), and the liver, intestine, spleen, kidneys, and testes were excised. changes in
the concentrations of serum and hepatic mva, and sterol
synthesis in different tissues were determined as described
below.
pravastatin was dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc). common marmosets in the control group received the vehicle (0.5% cmc) only.
determination of serum total cholesterol—blood samples were kept at room temperature for 40 min, and serum
was separated by centrifugation at 2,150 xg for 10 min at
4°c. the concentration of serum total cholesterol was determined enzymaticauy with a hitachi type 736 automatic
analyzer (25).
determination of serum and liver mva—the concentrations of serum and liver mva were determined using a gas
chromatographic-mass spectrometer with minor modification (34, 35). in brief, 300 mg of liver was homogenized in
0.9 ml saline for 1 min with a polytron homogenizer at the
maximal speed and the homogenates were used for measurement of the liver mva concentrations. after the addition of the internal standard, mevaonolactone-d4, to each
sample, mva was converted into the lactone form with
hydrochloric acid, and the converted lactone was extracted
using ethyl acetate. the extracts were evaporated to dryness and then dissolved in  xxxd2052xxx . lipids in the solutions were absorbed on a silica centrifuge column, and then
eluted with acetone. the dried extracts were trimethylsilylated with trimethyl chlorosilane and hexamethyl disilazone. derivatized samples were analyzed with a mass
spectrometer (hewlett packard model-5988). this involved
electron capture and selected ion mode monitoring of ions
at m/z ratios of 220 and 224 to detect the derivatised mva
and mevaonolactone-d4, respectively.
determination of sterol synthesis in tissue slices—sterol synthesis was determined ex vivo in tissue slices by
measuring the incorporation of p4c] acetate into digitoninprecipitable [14c]sterols as described previously (24-26).
statistical analysis—values are expressed as means ±
se. statistical analysis was performed with williams' test
or the paired t-test. comparison among the independent
groups was performed with student's i-test. the correlation
analysis involved pearson's correlation coefficient.

mva and total cholesterol after a single oral administration of pravastatin at 30 mg/kg are shown in fig. 1. the
pre-treatment values of serum mva in the control and
pravastatin 30 mg/kg groups were 74.8 ± 8.7 and 68.0 ± 7.0
nm, respectively. over the 24 h monitoring period, there
were no diurnal changes of serum mva or total cholesterol
in the control group. pravastatin had decreased the concentration of serum mva by more than 80% by 2 h after the
administration (fig. 1a). the reduced level of serum mva
returned almost to the pre-treatment level within 24 h
after this dosage. on the other hand, a single oral administration of pravastatin at 30 mg/kg did not significantly
change the level of serum total cholesterol (fig. ib).
the relationship between the serum and hepatic mva
levels, and the activity of sterol synthesis in tissues—
since pravastatin at 30 mg/kg maximally lowered the
serum mva concentration at 2 h after a single oral administration, we examined the relationship between the concentrations of serum and hepatic mva, and the activity of
sterol synthesis in some tissues at this time point. a single
oral administration of pravastatin at a dose of 0.03--30 mg/
kg reduced the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis in a dosedependent manner (fig. 2a). pravastatin even at the highest dose (30 mg/kg), however, did not inhibit the activity of
sterol synthesis in the intestine, spleen, kidneys and testes
(fig. 3). pravastatin also decreased dose-dependentiy the
concentrations of both serum (fig. 2b) and liver (fig. 2c)
mva, and these reductions occurred in a similar fashion.
effects of pravastatin on total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, and  xxxg1318xxx  protein—there were no changes in
the level of total cholesterol after the oral administration of
pravastatin at 0.03 and 30 mg/kg (fig. 2d). there were no

discussion

there have been some papers describing methods for determining whole-body sterol synthesis, such as cholesterol
intake/balance methods (13, 14), kinetic approaches (15,
16), and determination of the intermediate molecules of
cholesterol synthesis (17-21). these methods, however, are
complicated and need prolonged measurement intervals.
among these methods, monitoring of the serum mva concentration (17-19) seems to be a good indicator for wholebody sterol synthesis (18, 22, 23). these studies, however,
did not de-monstrate the major origin of serum mva, or
the relationship between the serum mva concentration
and the activity of sterol synthesis in tissuea in the present
study, we addressed these issues using pravastatin, a liverselective inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx  (24-27), and
common marmosets, a good model animal for examining
lipid metabolism (28-31).
in the present study, a single oral administration of pravastatin to common marmosets caused liver-selective inhibition of sterol synthesis: pravastatin inhibited dosedependently the sterol synthesis in the liver (fig. 2a), but
not in other tissues, such as the intestine, another major
tissue of sterol biosynthesis, kidneys, spleen and testes
(fig. 3). the liver-selective inhibitory action of pravastatin
was consistent with our previous findings with rodent models (24-27). under these conditions, pravastatin caused
parallel and dose-dependent reductions in the concentrations of serum (fig. 2b) and liver (fig. 2c) mva. in addition, there were good correlations among three parameters,
i.e. the hepatic mva level, serum mva level and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis (fig. 4). we, therefore, conclude that the origin of serum mva is the liver, and that
the concentration of serum mva reflects the concentration

of hepatic mva and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis
at 2 h after a single oral administration of pravastatin in
common marmosets.
we should consider the possibility that pravastatin may
enhance the decay of serum mva, leading to a reduction in
serum mva; the increase in the utilization of mva by the
liver and nonhepatdc tissues, and the increase in excretion
of mva from the body. using radiolabeled mva, mcnamara et al. (36) found that approximately 40% of the
metabolism of circulating mva occurs in the kidneys, the
remaining 60% of serum mva being taken up by the liver
and nonhepatic tissues for the synthesis of sterols (50%)
and nonsterol products (10%), respectively. since pravastatin cannot permeate the cell membrane in nonhepatic tissues (26), this agent did not significantly inhibit sterol
synthesis in the nonhepatic tissues. the results suggested
that pravastatin is less able to increase the uptake-protein
of mva in nonhepatic tissues. in addition, a single oral
administration of pravastatin did not even change the levels of  xxxg1318xxx  proteins in the liver, by which this
agent is taken up. we, therefore, think that the reduction of
serum mva after a single oral administration of pravastatin is primarily due to the inhibition of hepatic sterol synj. biochem.

in the control common marmosets fasted overnight (fig.
1a). kopito et al. (37) have also reported that in fasted
humans, there was no diurnal change of serum mva, although more than a five times diurnal change of serum
mva in fed humans was observed. in addition, parker et
al. (18) have shown that lovastatin, another hmg-coa
reductase inhibitor, maximally decreased plasma mva in
humans at 4r-6 h after its administration: the decreased
level of serum mva recovered and returned to the initial
level within 24 h. these data obtained in a human study
are similar to those obtained in the present study (fig. 1a),
indicating that common marmosets are similar to humans
regarding mva metabolism as well as lipid metabolism
(28-31).
we have reported that the 28-day administration of pravastatin to common marmosets at doses of 1-30 mg/kg dosedependently reduced the level of ldl-cholesterol (28):
pravastatin significantly reduced ldl-cholesterol at doses
of more than 3 mg/kg. in the present study, a single oral
administration of pravastatin to common marmosets at a
dose of more than 3 mg/kg reduced the level of serum mva
by more than 80% as compared to the initial level when
monitored 2 h after the oral administration of this agent.
these data might indicate that the reduction of the serum
mva level at 2 h after a single oral administration of pravastatin is a good indicator of the ldl-cholesterol lowering
effect of this agent. it is of interest of how pravastatin
affects the serum mva level in comparison with the ldlcholesterol lowering effect after repeated oral administration in these animal models and men. further studies are
necessary to clarify the clinical usefulness of serum mva
monitoring for examining the action of the statins in
patients who exhibit variety in the efficacy as to lowering of
serum cholesterol.
in summary, by using pravastatin, a liver-selective inhibitor of sterol synthesis (24-27), and common marmosets, a
good animal model for studying lipid metabolism (28-31),
we demonstrated that serum mva mainly originated from
the liver, and that changes in the level of serum mva
reflected the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis and the
content of mva 2 h after a single oral administration of
pravastatin in common marmosets.
