importance of the field: contrasting with the broad activation of the pi3k/
akt/mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) survival pathway in most cancer,
activity of rapalogues appears to be restricted to a few tumor types.
areas covered in this review: the analysis of molecular activity of the pi3k/
akt/mtor pathway and resistance mechanisms of rapamycin and rapalogues
led to the development of several inhibitory molecules.
what the reader will gain: new anticancer agents including pi3k inhibitors,
dual pi3k/mtor inhibitors, specific mtor inhibitors, and akt inhibitors may
have direct inhibitory effects on targets by competing with atp or may be
non-atp-competitive allosteric modulators of protein functions. in addition,
another way of blocking the abnormal activation of the pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway may be achieved by using hsp90 inhibitors. in this paper we review
novel drugs inhibiting the mtor signaling pathway.
take home message: several trials are ongoing with novel drugs targeting
key kinases involved in the mtor pathway. benchmarking those agents
with rapalogues in rationally designed preclinical models and conceiving
clinical trials in  xxxd2072xxx / xxxd3307xxx -sensitive tumor types may help to
identify drugs with a real clinical potential. understanding mechanisms
associated with primary and acquired resistance to rapalogues may help to
enlarge indications and provide a rationale for designing combinations that
will minimize the risk of developing resistance to rapalogues.

introduction

the pi3k/akt/mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) pathway is considered
one of the most commonly activated signaling pathways in human cancer [1,2].
rapamycin (sirolimus), first isolated from the soil of rapa nui (easter island),
was the first identified potent inhibitor of the  xxxg1743xxx /akt/mtor pathway. rapamycin specifically inhibits the function of mtor, a protein thus named when its
rapamycin-inhibiting properties were discovered. rapamycin was discovered as a
 xxxd3457xxx  produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus and was first used as
an antifungal agent against candida albicans and other yeasts [3]. rapamycin also
displayed immunosuppressive properties and is often used alone or in combination
with  xxxd1781xxx  after organ transplantation. in vitro and in vivo experiments
demonstrated that rapamycin yields cell cycle blockage in g1/s transition [4], eventually induces apoptosis or autophagy in cancer cells, and/or inhibits tumor angiogenesis. while rapamycin may induce a complete block in g1/s transition in
t cells, no effect on cell cycle was found in several other cell types. thereby, most

the proof of concept that inhibition of mtor may yield
survival benefit in patients with cancer has been
provided with  xxxd3307xxx  and  xxxd2072xxx  in patients
with renal cell carcinomas as well as in those with
mantle cell lymphoma.
contrasting with the broad activation of this survival
pathway in cancer, activity of rapalogues appears to be
restricted to a limited number of tumor types.
new anticancer agents can be classified as pi3k
inhibitors, dual pi3k/mtor inhibitors, specific mtor
inhibitors, and akt inhibitors.
most current anticancer agents are still in early stages of
clinical development and their potency, specificity,
safety, and antitumor activity remain to be established.
enrollment of cancer patients with specific genetic
alterations appears to be a key factor for monitoring the
success of such targeted therapies.
drug development of these novel anticancer agents may
also require early investigate in combination with other
targeted therapies (and chemotherapy) to encompass
pathway of redundancies and prevent resistance.
the antiangiogenic properties of these drugs may well
be underestimated in current studies and may warrant
further investigation to guide clinical development.

this box summarizes key points contained in the article.

cell-cycle and/or pro-apoptotic effects of rapamycin appear to
be cancer cell-specific, and may depend to some extent on
genetic factors.
rapamycin binds the cytosolic immunophilin protein
 xxxg798xxx  (fk-binding protein 12).  xxxg798xxx  specifically binds
the mtor complex 1 (mtorc1) but has no direct interaction on the mtor complex 2 (mtorc2). thereby, rapamycin stands as an allosteric inhibitor of mtorc1 with no
direct effects on mtorc2. several rapamycin derivatives
(rapalogues), sharing with rapamycin molecular moieties
responsible for interaction with mtor and  xxxg798xxx  and displaying very similar mechanisms of action, have been recently
developed such as  xxxd3307xxx ,  xxxd2072xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx ,
and are currently used in clinical trials with promising results
in the treatment of patients with cancer [2]. as a result of positive phase iii trials,  xxxd3307xxx  and  xxxd2072xxx  were
recently approved for the first- and second-line treatment,
respectively, of patients with clear renal cell carcinomas. furthermore,  xxxd3307xxx  displayed potent inhibitory properties
against  xxxg366xxx -dependent survival in lymphoma cells and
the drug was recently approved for the treatment of mantle
cell lymphoma. promising data in phase ii trials with  xxxd2072xxx  in neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, hepatocellular,
gastric, head and neck carcinomas, and several other tumor
types led to randomized phase ii/iii studies from which
mature clinical results are awaited. although the mtor signaling pathway is frequently activated in cancer, clinical
results of single-agent rapalogues remain somewhat limited
and restricted to tumors with highly developed angiogenesis.
920

this recently led to the hypothesis that rapalogues may
primarily act through their antiangiogenic properties [5,6].
current clinical development of rapalogues was impaired
by toxicity when combined with chemotherapy and several
targeted therapies. furthermore, the antiproliferative activity
of rapalogues appeared to be limited by various molecular
mechanisms of resistance in cancer cells. until now, mechanisms of resistance to rapalogues remains only partially
elucidated. for instance, akt (pkb) activation following
exposure to rapalogues seems to be a common feature in cancer cells and may at least in part contribute to cancer cell survival. current research seeks novel anticancer drugs designed
to overcome potential mechanisms of resistance to rapalogues.
screening of libraries from several drug companies allowed
the identification of molecules with inhibitory properties
against the kinases of mtor, pi3k, and/or akt. herein,
we review possible mechanisms of resistance to currently
developed rapalogues and current strategies aimed at counteracting such resistance using new compounds acting at
different levels of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway.
2.

the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway

the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway is frequently activated in
human cancers and plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, motility, survival, apoptosis, autophagy, and angiogenesis [7]. this pathway is activated by a variety of signals,
including nutrients such as amino acids, glucose and oxygen
and/or mitogens (hormones and growth factors) (figure 1) [8].
nutrients enter the cytoplasm by passive diffusion and
activate mtorc1 directly or indirectly in inhibiting the
tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx ). mitogens
activate mtor pathway through membrane receptors (such as
pdgfr,  xxxg1145xxx , vegfr, and  xxxg682xxx  -- 4) and cytoplasmic
molecules such as ras or  xxxg1194xxx  substrate ( xxxg1198xxx ).
these result in a direct (interaction of p85 subunit of pi3k
with tyrosine phosphate motifs on activated receptors) or indirect (ras,  xxxg1198xxx  proteins) activation of the pi3k. these signals
activate akt, which plays a central role in pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway by cooperating in activating many other cytoplasmic
proteins. the downstream multiprotein complexes mtorc1
(which contains raptor protein) and mtorc2 (which contains
rictor protein) may be activated. downstream targets of
mtorc1 are the ribosomal s6 kinase (p70s6k), activating
 xxxg1989xxx  and s6k2, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4e-binding protein 1 ( xxxg693xxx ). mtorc1 can phosphorylate
 xxxg693xxx , resulting in the release of  xxxg693xxx  from  xxxg692xxx 
( xxxg693xxx  binds the surface of  xxxg692xxx  to prevent its interaction
with eif4 g) and the interaction of  xxxg692xxx  with eif4 g and
other proteins to assembly the mammalian ribosome initiation
complex  xxxg692xxx  [7]. in cancer cells,  xxxg693xxx  phosphorylation
will eventually result in the initiation of translation. the activation of mtorc1 downstream targets leads to protein synthesis, such as cell cycle regulating proteins,  xxxg1048xxx , fgf,
vegf, stat3, c-myc [9].

in addition, mtorc2 complex is functionally distinct of
mtorc1 complex [2,10]. indeed, mtorc2 phosphorylates
the hydrophobic motif of the agc kinase family, including
akt (s473),  xxxg1837xxx  (pkca), and the serum/
glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (sgk1) [10]. while several
papers have been published on mtorc1, mechanisms regulating mtorc2 functions are not well understood. the
activation of mtorc2 complex leads to actin regulation,
cytoskeleton formation and cell survival [11].
mechanisms resulting in the activation of pi3k/akt/
mtor pathway in cancer cells are growth factor receptor
stimulations, amplifications or mutations of pi3k or akt,
losses of function of the negative regulator phosphatase and
tensin homolog (pten), and mutant forms of the ras oncogene. the activation of mtor (mtorc1 and mtorc2)
and the antiproliferative effects of rapalogues may be largely
dependent on the genetic background of cancer cells. the
pi3k/akt/mtor pathway is negatively regulated by the
pten and tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 ( xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx 
complex). pten catalyzes the degradation of the pip3
generated by the pi3k. pten is the most important negative regulator of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway and mutations of the pten gene cause an uncontrolled activation
of akt and mtor. pten is mutated, inactivated by
methylation, or deleted in many human tumors [12,13]. the

 xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx  heterodimer inhibits the mtor pathway. in
normal cells, the direct phosphorylation and the inactivation
of  xxxg2338xxx  by akt lead to mtorc1 activation.  xxxg2338xxx  stimulates the conversion of  xxxg1954xxx  (ras-homologue enriched in
brain, member of the small gtpase superfamily)-gtp to
 xxxg1954xxx -gdp, which inactivates mtor pathway. loss of
 xxxg2338xxx  function leads to enhanced  xxxg1954xxx --gtp signaling and
mtor activation [14-16]. nevertheless, many mechanisms
leading to mtorc1 remain unknown. for instance,
mtorc1 can also be activated directly, and independently
of  xxxg2337xxx  --  xxxg2338xxx  complex, by rag gtpases (proteins
involving in the modulation of nuclear transport) [17].
mtorc1 activity can also be mediated by pim, a serine/
threonine kinase. in vitro experiments showed that  xxxg1752xxx 
protein reduced the association between pras40 and
mtorc1 complex through phosphorylation of pras40,
and then increased mtor activity [18].
in recent years, rapalogues have been developed and
approved in advanced renal cell carcinoma [19,20] and pretreated mantle cell lymphoma [21], but the majority of malignant diseases still lack benefit when treated with rapalogues as
single agents. therefore, there is an urgent need to analyze
which mechanisms of resistance are prevalent in those diseases
to improve the use of new inhibitors of mtor in specific
situations for the future.

3. mechanisms of resistance to mtor
inhibitors

rapalogues are natural products that are in part substrates
for atp binding cassette transporters and subject to metabolism, leading to trivial mechanisms of primary or secondary
resistance that may affect their efficacy in clinical trials.
beyond those basic pharmacokinetic mechanisms, effects
resulting from mtor inhibition in cancer cells may also
trigger complex pharmacological mechanisms of resistance.
resistance to rapalogues is sometimes thought to be related
to the activation of signaling cascades other than the  xxxg1743xxx /
akt/mtor pathway. for instance, the raf/mek/erk
pathway has been shown to be activated under treatment
with  xxxd2072xxx  [22]. counteracting this activation using
 xxxd1661xxx , a novel raf/vegfr inhibitor, in combination
with  xxxd2072xxx  led to enhanced effects on cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo [23]. although most of these
mechanisms remains poorly understood, it is currently
suspected that mtorc2 and/or akt activation may play
a role in resistance to rapalogues. finally, deregulations of
cell cycle and apoptosis function may also be factors of
resistance to rapalogues in cancer cells. herein, we will focus
primarily on the role of mtorc2 and akt in resistance
to rapalogues.
effects of mtorc1 inhibitors on the
mtorc2 complex

3.1

rapamycin and rapalogues are primarily inhibitors of
mtorc1. a recent study [24] demonstrated that rapamycin
inhibits mtorc1 in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma
(dlbcl) lines, as well as in many models of tumor cells,
even if some of these models were resistant to rapamycin.
rapamycin was shown to activate mtorc2 and consequently akt473, which in turn represent a potential mechanism of resistance. in a recent study, the investigators
inhibited rapamycin-induced akt phosphorylation in lymphoma cells by knocking down the mtorc2 component rictor. thereby, activation of mtorc2 is frequently recognized
as an important mechanism of resistance to mtorc1 inhibition by rapamycin and rapalogues. mtorc2 was shown to
act by phosphorylating pkca [11]. pkca is known to be
involved in carcinogenesis and its role in actin cytoskeleton
organization and cell survival is extensively recognized.
thereby, pkca activation may play a role in resistance to
mtorc1 inhibition. in addition, gupta and colleagues
demonstrated that addition of the  xxxd565xxx   xxxd2839xxx  could overcome rapamycin resistance through a
phosphatase that antagonizes mtorc2 activation. the
investigators proposed to use histone deacetylase inhibitors
in combination with mtor inhibitors for dlcbl in future
clinical trials. since the mtor kinase is a catalytic subunit
that belongs to both mtorc1 and mtorc2 complexes,
drugs that target the mtor kinase have been proposed to
shut down the complete mtor pathway. some preliminary
922

preclinical and clinical results are available and will be
discussed later in this manuscript.
an interesting genetic syndrome that may be used as a
model for the study of mtorc1/c2 complexes in the clinic
is the tuberous sclerosis (tsc), a severe autosomal-dominant
disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomas in multiple organs [25,26]. tsc can cause intellectual
handicap, epilepsy, autism, and renal and heart failure. mutation of one or two tumor-suppressor genes  xxxg2337xxx  or  xxxg2338xxx 
may lead to these disorders. in this context, mtorc1 activation and akt suppression are observed. interestingly, huang
and co-workers [27,28] have shown that the tsc complex
( xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx ) is directly linked to the mtorc2 complex,
acting like an activator of mtorc2. in vitro, they found
that  xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx  complex could directly stimulate the activity of mtorc2. these results could be important to understand biological mechanisms associated with an increased
mtorc2 complex after inhibition of mtorc1 with rapalogues and to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance
to these drugs in human cancer models with a tsc-defined
genetic background. while inhibiting mtorc1 signaling,
the authors found that  xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx  complex promotes
mtorc2 activity. the loss of  xxxg2338xxx  decreases the phosphorylation of both pi3k-dependent and pi3k-independent substrates of mtorc2. stimulation of mtorc2 kinase
activity with purified  xxxg2337xxx -- xxxg2338xxx  complex in vitro showed
that this regulation was direct rather than through secondary
signaling events.
it is intriguing to observe that the loss of the tsc complex
could be associated with very high levels of constitutive
mtorc1 signaling, resulting in a syndrome characterized
by benign tumors [16]. this observation suggests that elevated
mtorc1 activity is not sufficient by itself for the development of malignancies. interestingly, recent studies have found
that mtorc2 activity was important for malignant transformation in some specific situations [29-31]. it remains unclear
whether the role of mtorc2 in cancer is mediated solely
through akt or also through its other downstream targets,
such as pkca.
3.2

inhibitors of mtorc1 may activate akt (s473)

many authors have also shown that mtorc1 inhibitors,
including rapamycin and rapalogues, activate p-akt(s473) in
several human cancer cell lines (figure 2) [32,33]. inhibition of
 xxxg1989xxx  by rapalogues was thought capable of activating  xxxg1198xxx ,
leading to a feedback loop mechanism that may reactivate
akt. however,  xxxg1198xxx -dependent akt activation would be
expected to occur on t308 rather than on s473. investigators
have subsequently suggested that mtorc2 may directly phosphorylate akt at s473. several studies have also found that,
while mtorc2 complex is not directly inhibited by rapamycin and rapalogues, prolonged exposure to these drugs may
inhibit both mtorc1 and mtorc2 activities [34]. using
rapalogues ( xxxd3307xxx  and  xxxd2072xxx ) in acute myeloid
leukemia models in vitro and in vivo, zeng and colleagues [35]

have shown that rapalogues play a critical role in blocking
mtorc1 complex but may also inhibit akt via
mtorc2 functions. gulati and co-investigators [36] found in
a glioblastoma cell model that akt activation was suppressed
by sirna silencing of mtorc2 co-protein rictor, but not
by mtorc1 co-protein raptor, confirming that akt activation was a direct effect of enhanced mtorc2. these results
are somehow confusing when compared to those described by
wang and colleagues, who found that akt activation by rapamycin was not dependent on mtorc2, since knocking down
rictor did not modify rapamycin-induced akt phosphorylation [37]. this was associated with the development of resistance
to mtor inhibitors [37].
although precise mechanisms of akt activation and regulation under exposure to rapalogues remains basically
unknown, akt activation is currently considered as a detrimental factor in the context of cancer progression and may
participate in acquired resistance to rapalogues.

new inhibitors of the pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway

4.

that of rapalogues. most frequently, novel pi3k/akt/mtor
inhibitors are small molecules competing with atp. those
compounds will be extensively reviewed in this paper. some
other drugs are non-atp-competitive inhibitors, such as
the hsp90 inhibitor that indirectly modulates akt. we
decided not to include these drugs in the review, although
their mechanisms of action may have an impact on the
pi3k/akt/mtor signal transduction pathway. new drugs
that compete with atp can be classified as pi3k inhibitors,
pi3k/mtor inhibitors, specific mtor inhibitors, or akt
inhibitors (figure 3 and table 1). target specificity for these
novel anticancer agents may sometimes be an issue and therefore, they may be preferentially referred as inhibitors of the
mtor signaling pathways with some degree of specificity
related to currently available data (table 1). many of these
new compounds are currently in phase i trials to evaluate their
pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in patients with cancer.
disease-oriented clinical trials with patient selection according to specific genetic tumor deregulations are still awaited
to serve as a proof of concept for these drugs.
pi3k inhibitors and dual pi3k/mtor inhibitors
pi3k is formed by a p85 regulatory subunit and a
p110 catalytic subunit. pi3k phosphorylates pip2, leading
to pip3, which in turn activates akt, then mtor (figure 4).
due to chemical similarities between the pi3k p110 subunit
4.1

the increasing attention paid to the role of the pi3k/akt/
mtor pathway in tumor progression as well as resistance
to rapamycin led to the search for small molecules that inhibit
the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway with mechanisms other than

and the mtor protein, some pi3k inhibitors may interact
with both pi3k and mtor and are referred as dual pi3k/
mtor inhibitors, whereas others, only blocking the pi3k
p110 catalytic subunit, are considered as more specific
pi3k inhibitors. pi3k inhibitors currently in clinical development may either inhibit all catalytic pi3k isoforms (p110a,
p110b,  xxxg1747xxx  and p110g) or only one specific isoform.
the complete inhibition of all pi3k isoforms has been
expected to be associated with toxicity such as immunosuppression and diabetes. in vivo study in human melanoma xenografts showed that  xxxd2942xxx , a dual pi3k/mtor inhibitor,
induced mouse immunosuppression [38]; but no report of
immunosuppression has been reported in patients treated
during phase i clinical trials. conversely, inhibition of only
one specific isoform was associated with a better toxicity
profile but activity seems to be more limited in cancers [39,40].
the proper balance between efficacy and toxicity related
to full or partial inhibition of pi3k isoforms remains
controversial [8].
 xxxd1801xxx  is a new orally dual pi3k/mtor inhibitor
displaying antiproliferative and antitumor activity [41] in
cancer models harboring pi3k mutations [42]. when tested
in breast cancer,  xxxd1801xxx  induced death in cancer cells
with her2 amplification [42,43] and/or  xxxg1745xxx  mutations,
but not in cancer cells with loss of pten function or
 xxxg1285xxx  mutations [43]. in addition, when tested in glioma
models,  xxxd1801xxx  yielded antitumor activities decreasing
vegf expression in glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. thus,
 xxxd1801xxx  was considered as a drug with antiangiogenic
924

properties [44] as well as direct antiproliferative effects in cancers. interestingly,  xxxd1801xxx  induced significant tumor
growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer xenograft models [45].
 xxxd1801xxx  is currently in phase i/ii clinical trials. another
pan-pi3k inhibitor,  xxxd3198xxx , also displayed both antitumor
and antiangiogenic effects [46] in human cancer models.
cal-120, a novel dual p110b/ xxxg1747xxx  pi3k inhibitor, was
shown to block the pi3k/akt/mtor cascade and thereby
decreased mtorc1 and mtorc2 activities. antitumor
effects were reported in a panel of 23 human cancer cell lines,
with the exception of cells with  xxxg1285xxx  mutations. laboratory
reports showed that cal-120 inhibited tumor growth in
mice bearing human cancer xenografts [47].  xxxd2787xxx  is
another potent oral pan-pi3k and mtor inhibitor [48] that
has been tested in a panel of human cancer cells and mouse
xenografts.  xxxd2787xxx  inhibits mtorc1, mtorc2,
and downstream cell signaling. cell growth inhibition was
associated with induction of apoptosis by the activation of caspases 3 and 7 [49]. in addition, experiments showed that breast
cancer cells harboring activating mutations of pi3k were preferentially sensitive to  xxxd2787xxx , whereas cells harboring
pten mutations were more resistant to  xxxd2787xxx  [50].
interestingly, transient increases in plasma insulin and blood
glucose were observed in treated murine xenografts [49]. other
pi3k and mtor inhibitors such as  xxxd196xxx  [51] and
sb2312 [52] showed very consistent results in vitro and
in vivo, including the inhibition of the mtorc1 and
mtorc2 pathways as well as the inhibition of tumor growth
in xenograft models, including those with mutations of pi3k

and pten [51].  xxxd1575xxx , a dual pi3k and mtor inhibitor
showed inhibition of cell proliferation in several human cancer cell lines and caused important tumor regression in
xenograft models [53,54]. several phase i clinical trials of
pi3k and mtor inhibitors are ongoing to detect evidence
of activity and to describe the toxicity profile of these novel
anticancer agents.
atp-competitive mtor kinase inhibitors
preclinical experiments have suggested that drugs blocking the
mtor kinase by competing with atp to the atpbinding sites may be potentially more efficient than other
mtor inhibitors such as rapalogues in cancer cells. unlike
rapalogues, kinase inhibitors do not require co-factors such
as  xxxg798xxx  to bind with mtor and, thereby, are expected
to inhibit mtorc1 as well as mtorc2 complexes, making
these interesting agents to recapitulate most of the antiproliferative effects of rapalogues, while preventing resistance due
to akt activation.

 xxxd267xxx , a novel mtor kinase inhibitor, was used in
several human cancer cell lines at concentrations that specifically inhibit the mtor kinase [55].  xxxd267xxx  displayed
potent antiproliferative effects and was considered more
efficient than rapamycin in several cancer models [56].
 xxxd267xxx  inhibits the phosphorylation of mtorc1 and
mtorc2 substrates and downstream proteins (p70s6k,
4e-bp1and akt) [57]. moreover, cells lines displaying intrinsic and acquired resistance to rapamycin and akt activation
were shown to remain sensitive to  xxxd267xxx  [56,57].
houghton and colleagues [58] and chresta and co-workers [57]
have evaluated  xxxd267xxx  in tumor xenografts, resulting
in growth inhibition in several human cancer models. several
studies have recently evaluated the cellular effects of
other novel mtor kinase inhibitors (ar-mtor-1 [59];
 xxxd2358xxx  [60], xl388 [61]) and consistently reported that
mtorc1/mtorc2 complex inhibition was associated
with antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo in solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies.

figure 4. mechanisms of action of drugs with dual mtor/
pi3k-inhibitory functions.

to investigate the respective role of mtorc1 and
mtorc2 inhibition in the antiproliferative effects of kinase
inhibitors, feldman and colleagues [62] have evaluated two
mtor kinase domain specific inhibitors named pp242
and pp30, targeting mtorc1 and mtorc2 complexes,
respectively. these two mtor kinase inhibitors display
stronger antiproliferative effects than rapamycin. the
authors also showed that mtor kinase inhibition using
pp242 was more potent than rapamycin to block the
formation of the  xxxg692xxx  complex. the inability of rapamycin
to sustainably and completely inhibit mtor functions
may, at least in part, be an underpinning molecular
mechanism that helps to explain the resistance of cancer cells
to rapalogues.
in summary, inhibition of mtor kinase is regarded as a
promising area of research for the identification of novel anticancer agents that may broaden the activity and overcome
resistance to rapamycin and rapalogues. most of the current
mtor kinase inhibitors seem to be directed against cancer
cell functions. effects of mtor kinase inhibitors on tumor
angiogenesis remain to be investigated.
akt inhibitors
akt plays a crucial role in the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway
and is therefore considered a promising therapeutic target.
numerous akt inhibitors have been developed, including
lipid-based phosphatidylinositol analogues, atp-competitive
inhibitors, and allosteric inhibitors, and some of them yielded
promising results.  xxxd2886xxx  is an oral bioavailable alkylphospholipid [63] that targets the pleckstrin homology domain of
akt, preventing its translocation to the plasma membrane.
in preclinical experiments,  xxxd2886xxx  has shown significant
antitumor activity [64] by inhibition of akt and other
pi3k/akt/mtor pathway components including mtor,
4.3

926

raptor, rictor, s6 kinase, and  xxxg693xxx  by promoting their degradation [65].  xxxd2886xxx  also induces caspase-dependent
apoptosis [66,67], as well as autophagy [65].  xxxd2886xxx  has demonstrated antitumoral activity in preclinical studies, but
clinical validation is lacking [68].  xxxd2886xxx  has been tested
as single agent in a phase ii clinical trial in recurrent prostate
cancer patients [69], but no objective response was observed
using psa criteria for response. nevertheless, other phase ii
clinical trials are ongoing, notably in combination with
other anticancer agents, and one phase iii has been started
in myeloma in a phase iii clinical trial in combination
with bortezomib.
 xxxd2240xxx  is an atp-competitive, pan-akt kinase
inhibitor that inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis
in a panel of cancer cells [70-72]. daily administration of
 xxxd2240xxx  produced significant inhibition of tumor growth
in mice bearing human tumor xenografts including ovarian,
prostate and breast cancers.
cct129254 is a small-molecule inhibitor of akt that has
already been tested in mice bearing human xenografts including breast, ovarian, kidney, lung, prostate, and colon cancers
[73]. the authors have shown a significant inhibition of tumor
growth in most animal models, even when using cells harboring egfr mutations. in addition, cct129254 seems to
have been well tolerated.
 xxxd2659xxx  is a highly selective non-atp-competitive akt
inhibitor that has already been tested in a phase i trial, being
well tolerated at the oral dose of 60 mg; mild to moderate
skin, gastrointestinal and general disorders were reported [74].
although still preliminary, these results support the continuing investigation of akt inhibitors in clinical trials for
patients with tumors that display akt activation, as well as
to counteract akt activation that appears to be a common
mechanism of survival in cancer cells becoming resistant to
cytotoxic drugs and targeted therapies.
5.

conclusion

various molecular mechanisms of resistance to rapalogues
have been identified. the use of new molecules that can target
the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway may yield broad antitumor
effects in tumor types that are dependent on this pathway
for survival. these new drugs, such as pi3k inhibitors,
pi3k/mtor inhibitors, mtor inhibitors, and akt inhibitors are currently used in the early stage of drug development,
either as single agents or in combination with cytostatic or
cytotoxic agents in specific tumor types. a better understanding of individual tumor biology may help drug development
in better-individualized tumor types.

carcinomas as well as in those with mantle cell lymphoma.
while the broader activation of this pathway has been
described in several tumor types, the clinical efficacy of rapalogues appears to be limited to tumor types with a high level
of neoangiogenesis.
several drugs capable of blocking the pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway are currently under investigation in clinical trials.
the aim is to broad the current spectrum of activity of rapalogues or to counteract acquired resistance mechanisms developed by cancer cells in response to mtor inhibition. most
current anticancer agents are still in early stages of clinical development and their potency, specificity, safety, and antitumor
activity remain to be established. enrollment of cancer patients
with specific genetic alterations appears to be a key factor for
the success of those targeted therapies. redundancies between
several survival pathways may cooperate to participate in resistance to these novel anticancer entities. we may well need to
improve our understanding of tumor biology before treating
patients with these drugs as single-agent therapy. we may also
need to investigate these drugs early in combination with other
targeted therapies to encompass survival mechanisms induced
by cross-talks in cell signaling. it is also possible that the
pi3k/akt/mtor pathway may act primarily by enhancing

angiogenic processes developed in tumor angiogenesis in
response to pdgf/pdgfr, vegf/vegfr, and other proangiogenic-dependent mechanisms. thereby, the antiangiogenic properties of those drugs may well be underestimated in
current studies and may warrant further investigation to guide
clinical development.
one of the cornerstones of resistance to rapalogues seems to
be akt activation. several novel mtor kinase inhibitors
inhibit downstream mtor signaling as well as akt phosphorylation. whether akt inhibition by novel mtor pathway inhibitors may provide a clinical benefit in clinical trials is
currently being investigated. to address this question, several
trials are currently using akt along with  xxxg1989xxx  or  xxxg693xxx 
phosphorylation in skin biopsy, activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and/or tumor biopsies as surrogate
markers to monitor activity.
