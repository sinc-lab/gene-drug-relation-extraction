summary to evaluate the role of endothelin (et) in respiratory homeostasis we studied the effects of the eta and etb
receptor blocking agent  xxxd358xxx  on respiratory mechanics and control in seven anaesthetised spontaneously breathing
pigs, for180 min after single bolus administration (20 mg/kg i.v.).the results show that the block of etreceptors induced a
significant increase in compliance and decrease in resistance of the respiratory system, entailing a significant reduction
of diaphragmatic electromyographic activity, without affecting the centroid frequency of the power spectrum.  xxxd358xxx 
administration induced a significant increase in tidal volume (v t), accompanied by a significant decrease in respiratory
frequency, without any significant change in pulmonary ventilation, co2 arterial blood gas pressure or ph. since the relationship
betweenv t and inspiratory time remained substantially constant after  xxxd358xxx  administration, the changes in respiratory
pattern appear to be the result of an upward shift in inspiratory off-switch threshold. both inspiratory and expiratory times during
occluded breathing were increased by block of etreceptors, suggesting also a central respiratory neuromodulator effect
of et. in conclusion the present results suggest that the block of etreceptors in spontaneously breathing pigs exerts a
role on mechanical properties of the respiratory system as well as on peripheral and central mechanisms of breathing control.

introduction
endothelins (ets) are a family of isopeptides (et-l, et-2
and  xxxg675xxx ) with potent vasoactive properties. et-l is a 21amino acid peptide isolated for the first time from porcine
aortic endothelial cells1 and it is known that et-1 is also
synthesised in the brain and its concentration in the
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is higher than that in the
plasma.2,3 different receptor subtypes for endothelin,
named eta and etb , have been identified. binding of
et-1 to eta as well as to etb2 receptors, localized on the
vascular smooth muscle cells, induces vasoconstriction,4
while binding to  xxxg677xxx  receptors, localized on the
endothelial cells, causes vasodilatation via  xxxd2738xxx 
and prostacyclin release.5,6 numerous studies using

himmunoistochemistry, autoradiography and in situ
hybridization techniques have shown the existence of
et-1 binding sites in the nervous system and particularly
in brain stem, hypothalamus, nucleus tractus solitarius
and ventrolateral medulla.7–10 both eta and etb receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system;
also some authors maintain that et-1 neuronal activity is
mediated by the eta receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane.11 this wide distribution of et-1 binding
sites in the brain and the presence of et-1 in csf suggest
that the peptide plays a role as a neuromodulator and
may be involved in the centrally mediated cardiorespiratory control.
previous works12–14 have shown that, in analogy with
other species, in pigs the comparison between a spontaneous pattern of breathing and one following occlusion
of airways at end expiration permits evaluation not
only of the phasic afferences from pulmonary vagal
receptors involved in the respiratory phase switching
mechanisms, but also the central respiratory rhythm.
because both receptor subtypes appear to be involved in
cardiovascular and respiratory responses, we used  xxxd358xxx , a dual et-1 receptor antagonist,15 to demonstrate the

centres.
materials and methods
all animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with our institutional guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals. when the pigs were present in our
institute they were fed with a standard diet with free
access to water, but were deprived of food for 24 h before
experimentation. at the end of each experiment the pigs
were sacrificed by an i.v. bolus of thiopental sodium. the
study was performed in 7 spontaneously breathing large
white pigs of either sex, weighing 23.29+1.54 kg
(mean+sem), and about 3 months old. the animals were
sedated with 0.05 ml/kg 1% propionylpromazine hydrochloride i.m. (bayer italia spa, milan, italy) and anaesthetised with 15 mg/kg of thiopental sodium (farmitalia
carlo erba, milan, italy) injected into the auricular vein. a
steady depth of anaesthesia was maintained during the
experimental protocol by continuous infusion of a dilute
solution of thiopental sodium (9 mg/kg/h). the animals
were tied in the supine position on a heated operating
table and, after tracheostomy, an endotracheal tube was
inserted into the lower portion of the extrathoracic
trachea. the tracheal cannula was connected to a fleish
pneumotachograph no. 2 (fleisch, lausanne, switzerland), to record the respiratory airflow and, by electronic
integration, the tidal volume (vt). the pressure drop
across the two ports of the pneumotachograph was
measured with a differential pressure transducer (statham pm 15, 10846). a side port of the tracheal cannula
was connected to a pressure transducer (statham 15299)
for measurement of tracheal pressure (pt). polyethylene
catheters were inserted into the right femoral artery to
monitor systemic arterial pressure and into the right
femoral vein for drugs administration. a balloon-tipped
catheter (swan-ganz 5f) was introduced into the right
jugular vein and allowed to float through the right heart
to the pulmonary artery. cardiac output (co) was
evaluated by the thermodilution method (cardiac output
computer 701, i.l., milan, italy). systemic and pulmonary
arterial pressures were recorded by connecting the
catheters to a fluid-filled capacitance manometer (bell &
howell 4-422). blood gas analysis was evaluated on
arterial blood samples (5 ml) using a haemogasanalyzer
(system 1302, i.l., milan, italy).
all signals were calibrated independently and recorded
simultaneously on a multichannel pen recorder (nec sanei instruments polygraph mod.8k40). mean arterial
pressure (map), mean pulmonary arterial pressure
(mpap) and heart rate (hr) were evaluated from the
polygraph traces; stroke volume (sv) was calculated as
co/hr.

procedure and data analysis
after recording 20 consecutive breaths for the determination of spontaneous pulmonary ventilation (v̇e) and
breathing pattern, analyzed in terms of tidal volumes,
inspiratory and expiratory times (ti and te) and respiratory frequency (fr), the changes in mechanical properties
of the respiratory system were evaluated by the airways
occlusions method. occlusions were performed at endinspiration or at various lung volumes during expiration,
in order to construct the passive volume–pressure (vt/pt)
relationship of the respiratory system. at each volume,
changes in pressure were computed after about 2–3 s, a
time that seemed sufficient to accommodate most of the
stress-relaxation phenomena. during the period of the
occlusion no evidence of spontaneous respiratory activity
was present. passive compliance of the respiratory system
(crs) was then obtained from the slope of the vt/pt
relationship, which was linear within the range of the
spontaneous tidal volume. after reopening of the airways,
closed at end inspiration, the passive time constant of the
respiratory system was computed at 64% of expiratory
flow. the resistance of the respiratory system (rrs) was
evaluated as time constant divided by crs. in addition, we
evaluated the reflex role of the phasic lung volumerelated vagal information by comparison between phasic
inspiratory time and the inspiratory time obtained during
occlusion of the airways at the end-expiratory level. the
occluded inspiratory time (tio) was determined on the
tracheal pressure record from the onset of the inspiratory
effort until the peak of negative pressure, developed in
the airways, and the occluded expiratory time (teo) from
peak value to the onset of the next breath.12
diaphragmatic electromyograms (emg) were recorded
directly from the anterior part of the right costal
diaphragm, using a transcutaneous bipolar concentric
needle electrode. the emg signals were recorded by an
electromyograph (keypoint, dantec), band-pass filtered
between 20 hz and 10 khz. raw emg signals were also
stored on a fm magnetic tape recorder (racal 4 channelsrecorder, racal, hythe, southampton), and then played
back through an anti-aliasing filter with a low pass filter
set at 1000 hz (frequency devices, model 902, heaver
hill, ma, usa) and digitized at 2000 hz by a 12-bit
analogue–digital converter (data translation inc, model
2801, marlboro, ma, usa). emg signals during the entire
inspiratory phase were processed with the hamming
window function and a 512 or 256 point fast fourier
transformation, using a personal computer to obtain the
power spectrum. the power spectra were quantified in
terms of the centroid frequency (cf). emg signals
throughout the entire respiratory phase were also
evaluated as moving-average electromyograms (demg)
by an rc integrator with a time constant of 100 ms.

study protocol
after evaluation of control values,  xxxd358xxx , a dual eta
and  xxxg677xxx  antagonist, freshly mixed in distilled
water, was i.v. administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg.
preliminary experiments showed that this dose was
sufficient to assure significant and reproducible inhibition of eta and etb receptors in pigs. all parameters were
evaluated in control conditions (time–30 min), immediately after  xxxd358xxx  injection (time 0 min), and each
30 min for a period of 180 min. the same measurements
were performed in a group of three shame operated pigs,
which received the vehicle alone instead of  xxxd358xxx 
administration.

statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean+standard error of the
mean (sem). the statistical significance of differences
between baseline values and post-treatment conditions
was evaluated by the student’s paired t-test. statistical
significance was set at p50.05.

results
no significant changes were found in any parameters
throughout the entire experimental period in the group
of shame operated pigs. table 1 reports the results
obtained in the group of seven pigs treated with
 xxxd358xxx . a significant although transient decrease in
mean systemic arterial pressure was associated with a
significant increase in heart rate. also pulmonary arterial
pressure and stroke volume decreased, even if not to a
significant degree. blood temperature evaluated by swanganz catheter showed a steadily increase, essentially
appearing 60 min after  xxxd358xxx  administration. in
control conditions arterial blood pco2 was 44.9 mmhg

obtained in control conditions and 150 min after  xxxd358xxx  administration, corresponding in all animals to peak

the values of inspiratory time obtained during occluded
breaths. the relationships were approximated by joining
the coordinates of the unoccluded to those of the
occluded breaths. the figure shows that  xxxd358xxx 
displaced the tidal volume vs inspiratory time relationship rightward, modifying vt and tio, without changing
phasic ti. figure 3(b) shows the expiratory vs inspiratory
time relationships obtained by joining the coordinates of
unoccluded to those of the occluded breaths in control
conditions and 150 min after  xxxd358xxx  administration.
data show that  xxxd358xxx  modified the te /ti balance,
essentially throughout the lengthening of phasic te and
occluded ti.
 xxxd358xxx  did not modify the centroid frequency of the
diaphragmatic electromyogram; on the contrary, a significant reduction in demg was observed during unoccluded
but not during occluded breaths as shown in figure 4.

discussion
our study shows that the dual block of eta and etb
receptors, in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing pigs,
significantly affects cardiovascular parameters, respiratory mechanics, breathing pattern and diaphragmatic
activity. particularly the lengthening of occluded inspiratory time, associated with an increase of tidal volume,
seems to reflect the involvement of ets on respiratory
centres activity. it is known that et-1 and  xxxg675xxx  are the
predominant et peptides in the central nervous system;
nonetheless, owing to the dual eta and  xxxg677xxx 
antagonistic action exerted by  xxxd358xxx , it is not possible
to ascertain the relative role played by et-1, et-2 or  xxxg675xxx 
in determining the effects detected during the present
study.16
our results show that  xxxd358xxx  causes a decrease of
map associated with a progressive and long-lasting
increase in hr. although etb receptors have been
associated with smooth muscle relaxation by the stimulation of  xxxd2738xxx  and prostacyclin release from
endothelial cells, eta receptors appear to play a prominent role in vascular tone control, mediating the
vasoconstriction and pressure responses at the level of
smooth muscle cells.17 thence the decrease in map, due
to the lack of the vasoconstrictor peptide effect, actuated

by the antagonist action of  xxxd358xxx , may be in turn
responsible for the activation of the baroreceptor reflex
leading to the increase of hr. nevertheless the permanence of the increased hr even when map is restored to
control conditions (table 1) may suggest a central role of
ets in cardiovascular regulation.
the mechanisms responsible for the changes in
mechanical properties of the respiratory system after
 xxxd358xxx  administration are less clear. although, in
principle, eta receptors have been found to be responsible for marked bronchoconstriction both in vitro or
in vivo,18–20clement et al.21 showed that such a bronchoconstrictor effect is very mild in pigs. moreover the
changes in rrs presently observed could be the result of a
change also in lung tissue resistive properties, depending
on pulmonary vascular factors. it is reported that
 xxxd358xxx  administration decreases lung water accumulation22 both reducing vascular permeability and improving pulmonary haemodynamics. consequently, the
changes in pulmonary arterial pressure may influence
extravascular lung water and hence pulmonary resistance
and compliance. unfortunately, after et receptor antagonism, the decrease in mpap, possibly promoting a
resorption of pulmonary water, was not statistically
significant and further investigations seem to be neces& 2001harcourt publishers ltd

sary to clarify the relationship between mechanical
properties of the lung and pulmonary haemodynamics
under these conditions.
the reduction in resistance as well as the increase in
compliance of the pulmonary system can explain the
reduced diaphragmatic involvement despite the increase
in tidal volume as it results in the present data. the
decrease in demg was not associated with any change in
power spectrum centroid frequency, demonstrating the
lack of recruitment of new motor units and the constancy
in neural respiratory drive, in line with the finding that
 xxxd358xxx  administration has no effect on ventilation,
arterial blood gas tension and ph. nevertheless, our
results after  xxxd358xxx  administration may suggest a role
of ets in respiratory centres rhythm regulation at the
central level. assuming that the comparison between the
phasic and occluded inspiratory time allows an estimate
of the reflex role of the phasic lung volume related vagal
information, our results show that ets also act as vagal
neuromodulators. in fact, after  xxxd358xxx  administration,
phasic inspiration time does not change, while occluded
inspiratory time increases. the lengthening of tio, that
reflects the activity of the respiratory centres in absence
of vagal influence, further shows the central role of ets,
but the rightward displacement of the vt/ti relationship
in the absence of changes in ti means that more afferent
input from pulmonary stretch receptors is needed to cut
short inspiratory activity. since the relationship between
vt and inspiratory time remained substantially constant
after  xxxd358xxx  administration, the changes in respiratory
pattern appear to be the result of an upward shift in
inspiratory off-switch threshold.
several authors reported that endothelin binding sites
are widespread in the brain8,10,23,24 and particularly in
medullary neurons, responsible for respiratory centre
rhythm.25
the central role played by et is suggested by several
investigations showing not only the wide expression
of et in the cns, but also its role as a neurotransmitter involved in cardiorespiratory and hypothalamic
functions.25–28
the progressive increase of blood temperature
observed in pigs after  xxxd358xxx  seems to confirm this
finding, even if the endothelin intrinsic mechanism on
the thermoregulatory centre is not clear. et-1 might
directly act as a neuromodulator or, inducing  xxxg1884xxx  expression, might indirectly favour the
release of pge2.29 it is known that after  xxxd358xxx 
administration et-1 plasma levels increase:30–32 this
may occur by involvement of endothelial etb receptors
acting as high-capacity storage/clearance site for circulating et-1.33 it has been reported that circulating et-1
does not cross through the blood–brain barrier, but
willette et al.33 maintained that non-peptide, a specific et

albertini et al.

receptor antagonists may act extravascularly/abluminally
to increase et-1 in the cns. to our knowledge, no data
are reported about extravascular activity of  xxxd358xxx ,
consequently we do not know if it can act only at an
abluminal or also at an extravascular level. in any
case, the increase of et-1 plasma and/or cns levels
might represent a mechanism of cyclooxygenase activation, inducing the increase of pge2. the last may
cross the blood–brain barrier and consequently, acting
at the hypothalamic level, may be responsible for
the increase in blood temperature.34 the progressive
changes in cardiac activity and in blood temperature,
observed by us, seem also to show that  xxxd358xxx 
induces a long-lasting block of etb receptors, considered
the main cause of et-1 clearance, even if hemsen
et al.32 do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may be involved in the overall elimination of the
peptide.
in conclusion this study shows that ets act as
cardiorespiratory centre modulators and that et-1 is
involved in the mechanism regulating blood temperature.
changes in breathing pattern, diaphragmatic activity and
mechanical properties of the respiratory system obtained
during block of et receptors can be considered a way to
improve pulmonary function, especially during diseases
associated with a great et release.
