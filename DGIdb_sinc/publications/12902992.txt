the clinical effectiveness of opioid maintenance for heroin dependence is believed to result from a medication’s ability to decrease mopioid receptor (mor) availability thereby replacing agonist effects, alleviating withdrawal symptoms and attenuating heroin effects. we
empirically tested this hypothesis in five heroin-dependent volunteers who were successively maintained on 32, 16, 2, and 0 mg daily
buprenorphine (bup) tablet doses. we predicted and confirmed that higher bup doses would decrease in vivo mor availability
(measured with pet and [11c] xxxd440xxx ), increase plasma levels of bup and its metabolite nor-bup, and decrease withdrawal symptoms
and hydromorphone (hyd) responses. relative to placebo, bup significantly decreased mean ( 7 sem) whole-brain mor availability
41 7 8, 80 7 2, and 84 7 2% at 2, 16, and 32 mg, respectively. regions of interest (rois) (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus,
amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate) showed similar dose-dependent effects. changes in mor availability varied across rois
(prefrontal cortex, 47% vs amygdala, 27%) at bup 2 mg, but were more homogeneous across rois at bup 32 mg (94–98%; except
thalamus, 88%). relative to placebo (0 ng/ml), peak plasma levels of bup and nor-bup were comparable and dose-dependent (0.5–1, 5–
6, and 13–14 ng/ml at 2, 16, and 32 mg, respectively). mor availability decreases were negatively correlated with bup plasma level and
positively correlated with questionnaire-based opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuation of hyd symptoms. these findings suggest
that high-dose bup maintenance produces near-maximal mor occupation, mor availability correlates well with plasma levels, and buprelated opioid symptoms and antagonist blockade exhibit concentration–effect relationships.

introduction
buprenorphine (bup) is a high-affinity, m-opioid receptor
(mor) partial agonist and k-opioid antagonist (cowan et al,
1977; heel et al, 1979; lewis et al, 1983). bup’s mor actions
offer agonist substitution (thereby reducing drug use,
craving, and withdrawal symptoms) and antagonist
blockade (eg subjective high and respiratory toxicity),
which can improve treatment outcome (bickel and amass,

1995). numerous clinical trials support the safety and
efficacy of bup (eg fudala et al, 1990; johnson et al, 1995,
2000; ling et al, 1998), which led to us food and drug
administration approval in october 2002 of two sublingual
tablet formulations (bup alone (subutext) or combined
with naloxone using a 4 : 1 dose ratio (suboxonet) to deter
parenteral bup misuse). unlike other opioid medications
(eg methadone), bup has low oral bioavailability relative to
sublingual bioavailability that led to the use of this different
route of administration. bup has a unique pharmacology
among opioid medications due to its intermediate intrinsic
activity and high affinity at mors. however, there are
presently no in vivo studies of the functional dosedependent relationship between the concentrations of bup
in brain (binding at mors) with concentration in the
peripheral compartment (plasma level) or with symptom
effects (ie agonist substitution and withdrawal alleviation)

and blockade of opioid effects. the present study describes
a within-subject multisystem approach to these issues,
which may be important for understanding the mechanism
of action of drug abuse medications.
a central belief underlying the pharmacotherapy of
opioid dependence is that the ability of a medication to
occupy brain mors (which mediate the abuse and
dependence potential of opioids) may predict its clinical
efficacy. specifically, higher medication doses are hypothesized to decrease mor availability (or ‘binding potential’)
and provide agonist replacement that minimizes withdrawal
symptoms, promotes clinic attendance, and prevents heroin
reinforcement, euphoria, and side effects. at present, this
hypothesis is relatively untested for drug abuse medications, and there are many important and interesting
questions to address. first, it would be valuable to know
the receptor occupancy requirements (ie dose-proportional
decrease in receptor availability) of a medication that yields
clinically useful effects such as withdrawal alleviation, drug
abstinence, or antagonist blockade. second, plasma levels of
a drug are sometimes assumed to proxy for cns
concentrations, but data are sparse as to whether medication plasma levels and receptor availability are linearly
related; this is likely to depend on several factors, for
example, affinity and biodistribution. third, the extent of
between-subject heterogeneity in receptor availability during medication treatment is not well understood. characterizing these individual differences, and their
relationship with other endpoints may provide theoretically
and clinically useful information, for example, whether
baseline levels of receptor availability relate to the severity
of physical dependence.
kling et al (2000) reported that heroin-abstaining
methadone-maintained patients (30–90 mg/day) had 22–
35% lower opioid receptor availability (measured with
positron emission tomography (pet) 22 h after the last
daily dose) than healthy controls. however, that study used
[18f]cyclofoxy, a nonselective m- and k-receptor marker
(carson et al, 1993); therefore, the binding potential
measure in that study refers to two receptor populations.
as methadone has higher affinity for mor than k-receptor
sites (kristensen et al, 1995), use of a nonselective radiotracer may underestimate mor availability changes. fortunately, a mor-selective ligand, [11c] xxxd440xxx , has been
developed and validated (frost et al, 1989; titeler et al,
1989), prompting our use of this radiotracer in the present
work. in a preliminary study, we (zubieta et al, 2000)
examined mor availability in three heroin-dependent
volunteers following 12 days of maintenance each on 2
and 16 mg sublingual bup liquid and after detoxification (6
days maintenance at 0 mg) under double-blind conditions.
in vivo binding potential measures were obtained with
[11c] xxxd440xxx  and pet 4 h following the daily bup dose.
bup dose-dependently reduced mor availability 36–50%
(across regions of interest (rois)) at 2 mg and 79–95% at
16 mg relative to placebo. decreased mor availability at the
2 and 16 mg bup doses paralleled decreases in ratings of
heroin craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms.
pharmacokinetic studies have showed that the bup
sublingual tablet produces peak plasma bup concentrations
that are approximately 50–60% of the same sublingual
liquid doses (mendelson et al, 1997; nath et al, 1999; schuh

and johanson, 1999). this opens the possibility that the
occupancy of mor-binding sites might differ between the
tablet and liquid formulations. as the tablet will be used
clinically, one purpose of the present study was to
investigate mor availability at 2 and 16 mg bup tablet
doses and retrospectively compare the results with our
previous study using these same bup liquid doses (zubieta
et al, 2000). another pharmacokinetic issue is whether norbup, the principal metabolite of bup, might influence (ie
additively decrease) mor availability. some animal data
suggest that nor-bup may have low brain permeability and
that the analgesic potency of nor-bup is four times less than
bup following i.c.v. administration (ohtani et al, 1995;
pontani et al, 1985).
earlier human laboratory studies showed that administration of subcutaneous bup (jasinski et al, 1978; mello
et al, 1982) or sublingual bup liquid (bickel et al, 1988;
rosen et al, 1994; walsh et al, 1995) could attenuate the
reinforcing, subjective, and physiological effects of mor
agonists. recent human laboratory studies have demonstrated that daily bup 16 mg sublingual tablet doses, relative
to lower daily tablet doses (2–8 mg), can significantly
decrease the reinforcing efficacy of m-opioids (comer et al,
2001; greenwald et al, 2002). an important question that
remains, pertaining to bup’s therapeutic efficacy, concerns
the functional relationship between mor occupancy
requirements and clinical outcome measures such as opioid
withdrawal suppression and antagonist blockade (cf woods
et al, 1992). for this reason, participants in the present bup
maintenance study were given the option to participate in a
hydromorphone (hyd) challenge study to determine the
correlation between mor binding, plasma concentrations,
and antagonist blockade ability.
the primary goal of the present study was to replicate
systematically our previous findings that bup maintenance
dose-dependently reduces mor availability in vivo (zubieta
et al, 2000). the present study included methodological
improvements to extend the scope and significance of these
earlier findings. first, we compared data obtained with the
bup tablet to those previously acquired with the liquid
formulation. second, we evaluated changes in mor binding
over a 16-fold range of bup daily maintenance doses (32,
16, and 2 mg), relative to placebo. third, we measured the
plasma concentrations of bup and its principal metabolite,
nor-bup, in the same individuals at these same bup doses.
fourth, we studied the ability of bup to suppress opioid
withdrawal symptoms, to attenuate effects of the full
m-agonist hyd, and correlated these changes with brain
concentrations of the medication (ie decreased mor
availability in vivo).

methods
participant recruiting and selection
institutional review boards of wayne state university and
university of michigan approved all procedures. this study
was carried out in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki as adopted and promulgated by the national
institutes of health. heroin-dependent volunteers were
recruited from the detroit area by advertisements and word
of mouth. volunteers provided medical history, blood and

protocol. the participants were initially outpatients for 2
weeks while being stabilized on 32 mg/day bup. bup
administration took place on an outpatient basis until 4
days prior to each pet scan, when all participants were
admitted to an in-patient unit (monday afternoon until
friday 1100); a subset of these subjects underwent hyd

urine samples, and received an electrocardiogram, tuberculin screening, and a physical examination. those selected
reported no chronic health problems and were not taking
prescribed medications. volunteers were not seeking
treatment and were willing to participate in a short-term
study involving bup maintenance and detoxification. an
experienced clinician administered a semistructured interview (scid-iv; first et al, 1996), and opioid dependence
severity was determined using the addiction severity index
(mclellan et al, 1985a, b). volunteers were excluded if they
met dsm-iv diagnostic criteria for a current axis i disorder
(excluding opioid and nicotine dependence), or were
cognitively impaired. during screening, volunteers were
required to provide a urine specimen that tested positive for
opioids and negative for methadone, benzodiazepines, and
barbiturates. cocaine-positive samples were allowed, but
subjects meeting dsm-iv criteria for cocaine abuse or
dependence were excluded and could not have cocainepositive urine samples on the days of pet scans (but did
not exclude subjects from undergoing hyd challenges). the
volunteers were also required to provide an alcohol-free
breath sample. after the procedures were fully explained, all
volunteers provided written informed consent and were
paid in proportion to time of participation. an optional,
coordinated study was designed to examine the ability of
the different bup doses to attenuate effects of hyd.
separate informed consent was required for volunteers to
participate in the hyd challenge study.
in all, 13 volunteers enrolled in the primary study and, of
these, seven discontinued. four stopped attending the
research clinic early in the protocol and were lost to
follow-up. we terminated two subjects’ participation for
unsanctioned drug use. another experienced an adverse
event that may have been an idiosyncratic allergic reaction
to  xxxd440xxx  or hyd. five (three males and two females)
completed all four pet scans and pharmacokinetic evaluations. three of these five volunteers also completed all four
hyd challenge sessions. a sixth participant (female)
completed all hyd test procedures, but did not complete
the final pet and mri scans due to withdrawal discomfort.
the six participants ranged in age from 34 to 45 years and
had completed from 9 to 14 years of education (median ¼ 11.5). participants reported using heroin from 2 to 20
years (median ¼ 5) and spending from $150 to $450 per
week on heroin (median ¼ $225). the primary route of
heroin self-administration was intravenous for three
volunteers and intranasal for three volunteers. all participants reported daily use of cigarettes. in the 30 days prior to
screening, three participants reported using marijuana at
least once, and one reported using cocaine at least once.

challenges after the bup dose and immediately prior to
admission. at 2 h after their bup dose on friday,
participants were discharged from the in-patient unit and
transported by taxi with a staff escort to the university of
michigan pet center. the scan began at about 1300 and
took about 90 min. after the pet scan, they were escorted
home and resumed outpatient bup maintenance until the
next in-patient admission. this cycle was repeated for each
bup dose evaluation.

drug administration
buprenorphine. heroin-dependent participants were maintained on different doses of bup hcl using combinations of
2 and 8 mg sublingual tablets (without naloxone) and
matching placebo tablets (manufactured by reckitt and
colman, london uk; supplied by research triangle
institute, research triangle park, nc, usa). bup was
administered daily at about the same time (always at 0900
during the in-patient stay). bup tablets (four per day) were
held under the tongue until they dissolved. the participant
took two tablets at a time while supervised by a research
assistant. when the first two tablets dissolved (determined
by visual inspection of the mouth), the next two tablets were
immediately administered in the same manner. the total
dosing time was usually about 10 min. volunteers received
bup induction doses over 11 days: 4 mg (days 1–2), 8 mg
(days 3–4), and 16 mg (days 5–7). participants were
maintained for 12 days on bup 32 mg (phase 1); 2 days
on 24 mg; 12 days on 16 mg (phase 2); 6 days on 8 mg and 2
days on 4 mg; 14 days on 2 mg (phase 3); and 12 days on
0 mg (phase 4). the study concluded immediately after the
final pet scan. volunteers were informed that they were
fully detoxified and heroin-abstinent, and reminded that
they could receive a treatment referral if they wished.
hydromorphone. hyd challenge sessions were conducted
on the eighth maintenance day (monday) at each bup dose

level, immediately before in-patient admission and 4 days
prior to each pet scan. hyd (dilaudid-hpt, 10 mg/ml
ampoules obtained from knoll pharmaceuticals, whippany,
nj, usa) was administered as a single 24 mg i.m. injection
into the deltoid muscle (volume ¼ 2.4 ml).

measures
urinalysis. observed urine samples for toxicology testing
were obtained three times/week (monday–wednesday–friday) during the outpatient period, and daily during each inpatient stay. semiquantitative analyses of urine samples (see
greenwald, 2002) were performed using fluorescence
polarization immunoassay (abbott adxs analyzer and
standard reagents). these were analyzed for levels of
opioids, methadone, cocaine metabolites, benzodiazepines,
and barbiturates.
vital signs and symptom questionnaires. during 2 days
(wednesday–thursday) of each in-patient stay, vital signs
(respiration rate, oral temperature, oxygen saturation, heart
rate, and blood pressure) were measured immediately
before and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 h after daily bup
administration. opioid symptoms and heroin craving were
also rated at these same time points. opioid agonist and
withdrawal symptoms were assessed using a 32-item
inventory (schuster et al, 1995), with 16 agonist scale
items and 16 withdrawal scale items. each item was scored
on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), yielding total
scores ranging from 0 to 64. heroin craving was measured
using the heroin craving questionnaire, which is a 45-item
scale with each item scored 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree). factor analysis of the 45-item responses
produced a 34-item factor (tiffany et al, 1995, unpublished
data; see schuster et al, 1995); the 34-item score has been
reported routinely in previous studies. both the 16-item
opioid symptom and 34-item craving questionnaire scores
are sensitive to opioid agonist dose-effects (greenwald et al,
1999, 2002; greenwald, 2002) and were used in our earlier
mor neuroimaging study (zubieta et al, 2000).
during hyd challenge sessions, vital signs and subjective
drug effects were measured three times. the following
visual analog scale (vas) ratings were added to the
measures above: good drug effect, bad drug effect, liking,
stimulated, high, anxious, and sedated. the entire assessment battery took about 45 min to complete. session
baseline assessments started 45 min prior to bup administration. assessments of post-bup effects began 1 h 30 min
after the bup dose. hyd was administered 2 h 15 min after
the bup dose and post-hyd assessments began 45 min
later. after completing these test sessions, the participant
was escorted to the in-patient unit for admission.
plasma pharmacokinetics. blood samples (8 ml each) were
withdrawn from an antecubital vein using a 22-gauge
butterfly needle, and collected into 10-ml vacutainer tubes
containing heparin. in all, 10 samples were taken: one
immediately before the ninth daily maintenance dose of
bup (0 h), and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postbup. after collection, each tube was inverted several times
and centrifuged for 15 min. the plasma was siphoned using
plastic, disposable pipettes, placed into plastic cryogenic

tubes, and frozen at 201c prior to analysis. plasma
concentrations of bup and nor-bup were determined using
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem
mass spectrometry (moody et al, 2002). the sensitivity of
this method is demonstrated by a 0.1 ng/ml lower limit of
quantitation. the time-to-peak concentration (tmax), peak
concentration (cmax), and 24-h area under the curve (auc)
values were calculated.

mor-binding measures. four pet brain scans were
conducted at 4 h after the last of 12 daily doses of bup 32,
16, 2 mg, or placebo. volunteers refrained from cigarette
smoking, caffeine, and food intake for 2 h prior to scanning.
brain images were acquired with a siemens ecat exact-47
scanner in 3-d mode (intrinsic fwhm resolution e6 mm
in-plane and 5 mm in the z-axis) with septa retracted.
participants were positioned in the pet scanner gantry using
the orbito-meatal line as the reference line, and one
intravenous (antecubital) line was placed. a light forehead
restraint was used to eliminate intrascan movement. all
volunteers also underwent a single high-resolution mri
scan, which was used to coregister pet functional images.
[11c] xxxd440xxx  was synthesized at high specific activity
(41000 ci/mmol) by the reaction of 11c-methyliodide and
a nonmethyl precursor (dannals et al, 1985), with minor
modifications to improve its synthetic yield (jewett, 2001).
approximately 15 mci (555 mbq) was administered to each
subject per pet scan, with a maximum mass injected of
0.03 mg/kg per study. this ensured that the compound was
administered in tracer quantities (receptor occupancy at
these tracer doses has been calculated at 0.3–0.6% for areas
of both high and low receptor concentrations). a total of
55% of the [11c] xxxd440xxx  dose was administered as a
bolus and the remainder as a continuous infusion, using a
computer-controlled automated pump to achieve steadystate tracer levels. in all, 16 sets of scans were acquired over
70 min with an increasing duration (30 s up to 10 min).
time points were decay-corrected by a calculated method
and reconstructed using hanning 0.5 filtered back-projection, in a 24  24 cm field of view and a 128  128 pixel
matrix, with scatter correction. attenuation correction was
performed through a 10-min transmission scan (68ge
source) obtained immediately prior to the pet study.
dynamic images were coregistered using automated computer routines (minoshima et al, 1992).
image data were transformed, on a pixel-by-pixel basis,
into two sets of parametric maps: (1) a tracer transport
measure (k1 ratio), which is proportional to cerebral blood
flow (tracer transport ¼ blood flow  extraction) and (2) a
receptor-related measure. tracer transport and binding
measures were calculated using a modified logan graphical
analysis (logan et al, 1996), with the occipital cortex (an
area devoid of mors; frost et al, 1989) as input function
(distribution volume ratio, dvr). the logan plot becomes
sufficiently linear 5 min after starting radiotracer administration, with a slope proportional to the (bmax/kd)+1 for
this receptor site (koeppe, 1999), where bmax/kd is often
referred to as the ‘binding potential’ (bp; mintun et al,
1984). kd is assumed to remain constant within subjects;
thus, the bp measure is presumed to be directly proportional to the concentration of mors in the human brain.

t1-weighted mr images were then coregistered to the k1
images and nonlinear warped to the international conference in brain mapping (icbm) stereotactic coordinates
(meyer et al, 1997). the transformation matrix was then
applied to the k1 and dvr images. rois of identical size
(9 mm diameter spheres) were then localized in the mr
images and subsequently transferred to k1 and dvr maps.
rois were placed bilaterally in all regions following
brodmann definitions. bup did not produce lateralized
differences in mor binding in a previous study (zubieta
et al, 2000); therefore, data for right- and left-sided rois
were averaged to yield a single regional value. the global
binding potential value was calculated using spm99 (friston
et al, 1995) as the average value across all brain voxels.

data analyses
data for mor binding are expressed as the mean 7 1 sem
for the dvr minus 1 of each roi (binding potential
measure, bp ¼ bmax/kd). we examined different pharmacokinetic indices (eg peak and several auc post-bup
measures) that were very highly correlated with one
another. for simplicity, we used the mean of the 3-h and
4-h post-bup time points because these data were collected
at the same time points as mor binding estimates. bup
dose-dependent changes in regional mor binding were
examined with one-way univariate repeated measures
analyses of variance (anovas) using superanovat. bup
dose- and time-dependent changes in plasma drug and
metabolite levels were evaluated with two-way univariate
dose  time repeated measures anovas. opioid withdrawal and agonist symptoms, heroin craving scores, and
vital signs related to bup administration during two
consecutive days of the in-patient stay were analyzed with
three-way dose  day  time univariate anovas. all
analyses used huynh–feldt adjustments for violations of
sphericity. bup attenuation of hyd-induced subjective
effects and vital signs was examined using post-hyd minus

post-bup change scores (ie excluding pre-bup session
baseline values), which were entered into one-way bup
dose anovas. individual-subject pearson correlation
coefficients were calculated across the four bup dose
conditions to examine associations among the variables.
the minimum level of significance in all analyses was set at
po0.05.

results
urinalysis
urine toxicology testing indicated that participants continued to use opioids during the four outpatient periods,
regardless of bup tablet dose, although self-reported
amounts of heroin used decreased by more than half at
the two higher maintenance doses. urinalysis testing of
samples collected during each in-patient stay indicated that
urine samples of four of the five participants were drug free
on the mornings prior to pet scans. opioid urine levels
decreased more slowly for the fifth participant (female) than
other participants across in-patient days, testing between
500 and 635 ng/ml on the mornings of the four pet scans
(300 ng/ml is the cutoff value for a positive urine in this
assay). nevertheless, we decided to include this subject in
the sample because her whole brain and regional mor
availability values were within 10% of the other subjects and
did not meet criteria as an outlier. as mor availability in
this subject was not different relative to other subjects, the
changes secondary to bup administration would not be
likely to be heavily influenced by the possible presence of
residual opioids and/or slower metabolism.

bup effects on lor availability
compared to the placebo condition, bup 2 mg decreased
mor availability 27% (amygdala) to 47% (prefrontal cortex),
with a reduction in whole-brain mor availability of 41%.

buprenorphine tablet maintenance dose (mg s.l.)

figure 2 bup dose-dependently decreased mor availability for five heroin-dependent participants, as shown in four rois. upper left: prefrontal cortex
(brodmann area 11). upper right: subgenual anterior cingulate (brodmann area 25). lower left: nucleus accumbens. lower right: amygdala. decreases in
availability appear as increasing values on the ordinate because this reflects greater displacement of the mor radiotracer, [11c] xxxd440xxx , by higher bup
doses.

in rank order from high to low. relative to placebo, bup
16 mg reduced mor availability 85–92%, and bup 32 mg
decreased mor availability 94–98%. mor binding potential
of bup at these two higher doses was more consistent
across rois, although the thalamus showed slightly less
reduction. significant dose-dependent decreases in mor
availability were demonstrated for whole-brain estimates
and all rois. least square post hoc testing indicated that, for
all rois, mean mor availability significantly differed
between all doses except for the 32 vs 16 mg comparisons
(which never differed from one another). as shown in
figure 2, interindividual variability was marked at the bup
2 mg dose (up to six-fold, depending on the roi), whereas
interindividual variability was minimal for the bup 16 and
32 mg conditions. figure 3 illustrates clear dose-related
changes in mor availability for all rois for one representative subject (#7500; also see figure 2).
to examine the comparability of changes in mor
availability produced by liquid and tablet formulations
of bup, we compared binding changes from the present
study with those obtained in our previous report
(zubieta et al, 2000). data for the 2 and 16 mg doses were
examined using percent change from placebo (the 32 mg
dose was not administered in the earlier study). mor
binding in the rois was obtained using identical procedures for both sets of data. analyses of variance indicated
no formulation or formulation  dose effects for any roi
(all p’s40.30), indicating no significant differences in mor
binding change between the bup tablet and liquid delivery
systems. table 1 enables the reader to compare the
mor binding values for these doses across the two
formulations.

and 32 mg (row 5). images are scaled so that binding in the occipital cortex,
an area devoid of m receptors, is equal to 1. four transverse sections (from

(cmax), and auc measures are shown in the table inset. with the 0-mg doses coming after prolonged bup maintenance, there existed the possibility of
residual drug or metabolite being present; accordingly, these samples were also subjected to analysis. bup was not detected in any sample and is displayed as
0 ng/ml; nor-bup was occasionally found in quantifiable amounts, resulting in mean values slightly in excess of 0 ng/ml. for bup plasma levels, there were
significant effects of dose, f(3,96) ¼ 22.48, po0.01, and time, f(8,96) ¼ 9.66, po0.005, but no significant dose  time interaction (po0.07). for nor-bup
plasma levels, there were significant effects of dose, f(3,96) ¼ 21.27, po0.01, and time, f(8,96) ¼ 3.68, po0.04, but no significant interaction (po0.13).
least squares post hoc testing indicated that mean bup and nor-bup plasma levels significantly differed from one another at all doses except between 2 mg
and placebo.

(cmax) of bup and nor-bup at each maintenance dose were
similar. however, nor-bup accumulated more than bup
from 2- to 24-h following the daily dose, as indicated by the
roughly two-fold higher auc values for nor-bup.

the two high bup doses significantly decreased the ability of
hyd to increase opioid agonist symptom scores and drug
‘high’. a similar, but nonsignificant, trend was observed for
‘good drug effect’. there were no other trends for subjective
drug effects.

bup-related opioid symptoms
the first two rows of data in table 2 present opioid
withdrawal and agonist symptom scores during bup
maintenance. the average withdrawal scores on day 1
(but not day 2) of the in-patient stay significantly increased
during maintenance on bup placebo and 2 mg daily doses
relative to the two higher maintenance doses. average
opioid agonist scores on days 1–2 of the in-patient stay
tended to increase at higher bup doses, but this was not
significant. there were no other significant effects for
symptom measures (eg heroin craving) or vital signs related
to bup dose during the in-patient stays.

functional relationships among measures
to assess bup dose-dependent relationships, mean values
for medication concentrations and effects were correlated
across the four bup dose levels; these are presented in
table 3. variables of interest were whole-brain mor
binding; plasma level of bup (3–4 h post-bup, when mor
availability was measured); opioid agonist and withdrawal
symptoms, and heroin craving during bup maintenance (in
the absence of hyd); and hyd-induced subjective and
physiological effects. m-receptor binding and bup plasma
levels were significantly related. mor availability was
significantly and positively related to baseline withdrawal
symptoms and heroin craving, and negatively related to
opioid agonist symptoms. there were correlations of similar
magnitude (but opposite sign) between bup plasma levels
and these subjective measures. finally, greater mor

mor availability refers to mean (n ¼ 5) whole-brain absolute bmax/kd values. similar results were obtained when separate pearson correlation coefficients were
computed between mor availability in brain rois and the other measures.
b
plasma level is the mean (n ¼ 5) bup concentration averaged from the 3- and 4-h post-bup time points, that is at the same post-bup time that mor availability was
measured.
c
mean (n ¼ 5) opioid withdrawal, agonist symptom and heroin craving measures represent the average questionnaire scores across two in-patient hospitalization days
of bup maintenance, independent of hyd challenges.
d
hyd responses are the mean pre- to post-hyd change scores for total agonist symptoms, and vas ratings of drug ‘high’ and ‘good effect’. these data were available
for three participants, and correlations of this measure with mor binding potential and bup plasma levels were computed only for these three subjects. significance of
these correlation coefficients was not determined due to the small sample size.

availability and lower plasma levels (at lower bup doses)
was related to greater hyd subjective effects (ie less
antagonist blockade). however, due to the small number
of subjects, the significance of these latter correlations could
not be assessed.

discussion
this study replicates and extends previous findings
(zubieta et al, 2000) that bup, a newly approved medication
for heroin abuse, dose-dependently binds in vivo to human
brain mors, which mediate the reinforcing and physical
dependence-producing effects of heroin. a major aim of
this study was to assess the relationship between the
concentrations of bup in the brain (mor occupancy) and
periphery (plasma levels) across doses for each participant.
plasma levels are sometimes assumed to serve as a proxy for
brain levels, but this assumption has rarely been evaluated.
another aim was to assess the magnitude of relationships of
both mor binding and plasma levels to clinically relevant
opioid symptom effects.
daily bup tablet maintenance produced substantial doserelated decreases in mor binding, reaching nearly complete
(490%) occupancy of most roi receptor sites. the tablet
doses that produced these large changes in mor binding
potential are roughly similar to bup liquid doses that have
been shown to be clinically effective in treatment studies
(bickel and amass, 1995; johnson et al, 2000; ling et al,
1998; schottenfeld et al, 1993). the mean mor binding
potential values for the 32 mg/day dose were higher than,
but did not significantly differ from, the 16 mg/day bup
dose. binding changes produced by the 2 mg dose were
lower and more variable across subjects, consistent with our

previous data (zubieta et al, 2000). the present study also
found significant dose- and time-dependent changes in
plasma concentrations of bup and its metabolite, nor-bup.
peak plasma levels of bup and nor-bup were similar
shortly after the daily maintenance dose, whereas nor-bup
accumulated more during the 24-h sampling period than
bup. these peak bup plasma levels produced by daily
tablet doses of 16 mg (6.3 ng/ml) and 2 mg (0.3 ng/ml) were
higher and lower, respectively, than peak bup plasma levels
produced by the 8 mg tablet in this laboratory (3 ng/ml;
schuh and johanson, 1999). therefore, the present findings
are internally and externally consistent.
using the bup plasma concentration from 4 h postadministration, which corresponds to when mor availability was
measured with pet, individual-subject correlation coefficients between these two measures were high, albeit
imperfect, during steady-state maintenance. similar relationships between mor binding and drug plasma concentration were obtained using alternative pharmacokinetic
indices, including the sum of bup and nor-bup levels. one
explanation for the observed correlations is that the binding
estimates in the present study could involve a three-way
competition among bup, nor-bup, and tracer doses of
[11c] xxxd440xxx  used to measure receptor concentrations,
that is, such that competition from nor-bup would weaken
the relationship. however, data suggest that nor-bup has
limited access to the brain (ohtani et al, 1995; pontani et al,
1985). as the present study allowed for washout of illicit
heroin (and other drugs) and as nor-bup probably has little
influence, it appears that bup is the principal compound
competing with [11c] xxxd440xxx  when measuring mor
availability in the present study. one potential reason for
the imperfect linear association between bup levels in brain
(mor availability) and periphery (plasma concentration)
neuropsychopharmacology

buprenorphine and l-receptor availability
mk greenwald et al

2008

could reflect hysteresis (ie a nonlinear relationship) due to
the high affinity of bup at mors.
to compare the extent of mor occupancy across bup
sublingual liquid and tablet formulations, this study
included tablet doses of 2 and 16 mg thereby matching
our previous study using the same liquid doses and pet
scanning procedures (zubieta et al, 2000). this comparison
is of interest because pharmacokinetic data (mendelson
et al, 1997; nath et al, 1999; schuh and johanson, 1999)
suggest that bioavailability of the bup tablet is about 40–
50% lower than the liquid formulation. inspection of data
for individual rois found close agreement at each dose
across studies except for the amygdala, which (due to its
small size) is subject to partial volume averaging effects and
lower signal-to-noise ratios. statistical comparison of bupinduced mor availability changes in this study and the
previous one found no significant differences between the
liquid and tablet formulations. these findings suggest that
the bup liquid vs tablet formulation potency differences
previously observed for plasma levels may not apply to
brain concentrations. the fact that the liquid and tablet
produced similar reductions in opioid withdrawal symptoms at each dose in both studies further supports this
conclusion. although this comparison produced encouragingly similar data, the conclusions are necessarily limited
by the small sample sizes used in each study. specifically,
caution should be exercisedfespecially at low bup doses
(or high receptor availability levels)fbecause the lack of
statistical difference (ie apparent similarity) in mean mor
availability across bup formulations could be masked by
large standard deviations.
results of this study support a previous finding of an
inverse relationship between bup plasma levels and withdrawal symptoms (kuhlman et al, 1998). the present study
similarly showed that mor availability was also strongly
related to withdrawal symptoms. other subjective effects
measures (eg agonist symptoms, craving) were also
significantly correlated with these biological measures of
bup concentration. these data demonstrate a direct (within-subject, dose–response) relationship between in vivo
human brain receptor binding and clinical symptoms
produced by a drug abuse medication, which has long been
assumed to occur, but not previously tested in humans. the
final aim of this study was to begin exploring the relationship between decreased mor availability or higher plasma
concentrations and the ability of bup (a partial mor
agonist) to exhibit functional antagonism of the effects of
hyd. for participants who contributed to this preliminary
assessment, hyd effects were attenuated as predicted.
furthermore, albeit the sample size was small and precluded
statistical evaluation, the ability of bup to bind to mors was
positively related to its antagonist blockade of hyd
subjective effects.
in conclusion, the novel findings of this study are as
follows: the bup tablet dose-dependently decreased in vivo
mor availability (replicating previous results with the bup
liquid formulation), increased plasma levels of bup and its
metabolite nor-bup, decreased opioid withdrawal symptoms, and attenuated hyd effects. mor binding dosedependently correlated with plasma levels, withdrawal
symptoms, and blockade of hyd agonist symptoms. this
study integrates information across these multiple levels of
neuropsychopharmacology

analyses, helping to characterize the pharmacodynamic
actions of bup and improve understanding of the
functional relationships among clinically relevant endpoints.
