summary-this paper summarizes the animal and human studies with  xxxd2725xxx  available at the time of
the meeting. the following was demonstrated in the rat and confirmed in man: interaction of  xxxd2725xxx 
with the prostatic  xxxg183xxx , antiandrogen activity against testosterone (in particular against the
early transient rise induced by  xxxg930xxx  analogs) and adrenal androgens. thus, as shown in 4 different
double blind studies performed in stage d2 prostrate cancer patients, the combination of  xxxd2725xxx  with
surgical or chemical castration enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone and thus seems a step
forward in the hormonal treatment of prostatic carcinoma.

potent antiandrogen activity in the hamster and dog
than in the rat [14].
(2)  xxxd2725xxx  did not interact with the receptors
of other steroid hormones and thus was devoid of
other hormonal or antiho~onal
activities, by contrast to steroid antiandrogens [3,5,14-201.
(3)  xxxd2725xxx  was active by itself, by contrast to
 xxxd2143xxx  which needs to be converted
into
hydrox~uta~de
in order to act [21-231.
the phar~cokinetics
of  xxxd2725xxx  in the rat and
dog [4,24] revealed a good absorption by oral route
and a long plasma half-life (around 7 h in the rat and
11 h in the dog). a high (in the fm order) and
sustained plasma level of  xxxd2725xxx  was obtained
after a single oral administration
of lomg/kg to
castrated rats. this could explain why, in spite of its
low rba and its rapid dissociation from the ar in
vitro, a high and sustained interaction with ar was
observed in uivo [4,5].
 xxxd2725xxx  was thus selected to treat prostatic
carcinoma in men, and the rationale of combining
antiu~droge~ treutment with surgical or chemical
castration was demonstrated in experimental models
designed to mimic the therapeutic context [5, 141.

introduction
androgens
of testicular and adrenal origin are the
principal
growth factors for both normal or can-

cerous prostatic tissue. the non-steroid
antiandrogen, anandronk ( xxxd2725xxx  = ru 23 908), is
being developed at roussel uclaf [l-5] for the
treatment of prostatic cancer patients whose testosterone is suppressed by chemical or surgical castration, to counteract the trophic effect of adrenal
androgens which remain after castration [6-s] and to
inhibit the “flare-up” effect due to the early transient
rise in testosterone when castration is performed by
treatment with  xxxg930xxx  anaiogs[9-121, this paper
summarizes the animal and human studies currently
available with  xxxd2725xxx .

animal studies

 xxxd2725xxx  was selected on three pharmacological
criteria:
(1)  xxxd2725xxx 
interacted
with the cytosol
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) of the castrated rat prostate
with a weak relative binding affinity (rba),
decreasing with the time of incubation (rba =
4.5% and 0.5% of that of testosterone after 30 min
and 24 h of incubation at o’c), indicating that the
complex formed between  xxxd2725xxx  and the receptor was less stable than that formed with
testosterone [13]. this was related to an antiandrogen activity of  xxxd2725xxx 
against exogenous
androgens, at doses between 1 and 50 mg/kg on the
castrated rat prostate without agonist activity even at
high doses [z, 3, 141.
the rba of  xxxd2725xxx  was higher for the ar of
the prostatic tissue of hamster, dog, and human than
for the rat prostate ar and this was related to a more

*to whom correspondence

three points were to be confirmed:
(1)  xxxd2725xxx  was able to inhibit the trophic effect
of adrenai androgens
on the prostate of castrated
rats. adrenal androgens are very weak androgens by
themselves but can be converted
in the prostatic cell

into testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
(dht)
[6-x, 2.51. plasma assays in castrated men[rj
indicated that while testosterone and dht concentrations were less than 10% of those measured before
castration, the concentration of 3n  xxxd175xxx 
glucuronide,
which is the metabolite of dht
excreted in the plasma and thus reflects tissular dht
concentration,
remains -30%
of pre-castration
levels, presumably due to the transformation
of
adrenai androgens into dht. however, laboratory
animals, and especially the rat, secrete very low

should be sent.

fig. 1. inhibition by  xxxd2725xxx  of the trophic effect of
adrenal androgens on the “castrated” rat prostate. group
of 5 adult male rats were continuously administered adrenal
androgens by minipumps for i5 days. one group was left
intact, while the other had their testosterone secretion
suppressed by orchiectomy from the first day of adrenal
androgen administration.each castrated group was treated
simultaneously with solvent or increasing doses of  xxxd2725xxx . one group of rats was orchie~tomized but had no
adrenal androgen supplementation. prostate weights were
determined on the 16th day.

amounts of adrenal androgens in comparison to men.
in order to clarify the role of adrenal androgens, we
introduced the four principal adrenal androgens (a4
androstenedione,
1 lp-hydroxy
androstenedione,
dhea and dhea sulfate) to rats by minipumps for
15 days (fig. 1). this resulted in plasma levels
equivalent to those observed in humans (a4 = 0.7 f
0.1, 118 oh a4=1.3*0.2,
dhea=3.7*0.6,
dhea
sulfate = 684 f 55 ng/ml).
under
these
conditions when testosterone secretion was suppressed by orchiectomy, the prostate weight was
30% of that of non-castrated controls, the remaining
tissue probably stimulated by the trophic effect of the
adrenal androgens. when  xxxd2725xxx  was given to
rats from the day of castration, the trophic effect of
adrenal androgens was completely inhibited and the
weight of the prostate was reduced to that of totally
androgen deprived rats (fig. 1). similar results were
obtained in rats receiving adrenal androgens, but
whose testosterone secretion was suppressed by
diethylstilboestroi
or  xxxg930xxx  analog ( xxxd387xxx )
r5, 141.
(2)  xxxd2725xxx  was also shown to inhibit the “flareup” effect of  xxxg930xxx  analogs in the rat (fig. 2) when
intact rats were given a daily administration
of
 xxxd387xxx , there was a transient increase in prostate
weight due to the transient rise in testosterone. the
castrating effect of  xxxd387xxx  started only after a few
days in contrast to the immediate atrophic effect of
orchiectomy. the combination of  xxxd2725xxx  with
 xxxd387xxx  completely inhibited this transient trophic
activity of the  xxxg930xxx  analog and the castrating

treatment

fig. 2. inhibition of the effect of the initial rise in testosterone induced by  xxxd387xxx  treatment in the rat. groups of
5 adult male rats received daily for is days a s.c.injection of
 xxxd387xxx  (i yg/kg per day) alone or combined with an oral
administration of  xxxd2725xxx  (20 mgikg per day). control
intact rats and a group of castrated rats received solvent
only. the rats were killed after 2,4 or 15 days of treatment
or 2, 4 or 15 days after castration and prostates were
weighed.

effect of the combination was very similar to that of
orchiectomy.
(3) finally, the antiandrogen effect of  xxxd2725xxx 
was measured in an experimental androgen-dependent tumor model,
the shionogi
carcinoma
model [26]. the combination of  xxxd2725xxx  with castration was able not only to delay the appearance of
tumors in mice inoculated with carcinoma cells, but
also to decrease the incidence of tumors, although in
the few remaining tumors androgen-independent
cells were able to grow under the total androgen
blockade treatment [ 141.

studies in man

studies were performed in man, to assess the
kinetic profile of  xxxd2725xxx , to confirm its antiandrogenic activity and to evaluate its tolerance and
efficacy in patients with prostate cancer.
(1) kinetics: the compound was almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; a
high concentration
of non-metabolized
compound
was observed during the first hours following administration of a single dose and the half-life of
elimination was about 48 h, which permits a once-aday administration 1233.
during chronic intake, the steady-state concentration was attained after about 2 weeks, and was
proportional to the dose [23,27].
(2) the anti-androgenic activity of  xxxd2725xxx  was
studied in six healthy volunteers who received the
compound at the dose of 300 mg/day. after 4 and x
weeks of treatment, the plasma concentrations
of
lh, testosterone and estradiol, and the lh response
to  xxxg930xxx  stimulation had markedly increased, a
enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone on

studies of the antiandrogen

groups and the groups treated with orchiectomy or
 xxxd387xxx  alone:
more patients improved subjectively in the active
drug groups, as evidenced by the higher percentages
of patients who reported decreased bone pain and
whose performance status was improved at months
1, 3, and 6 of treatment (significantly different from
placebo in two studies). when  xxxd2725xxx  was given
together with  xxxd387xxx  (study ii) it prevented the
increase in bone pain reported during the first month
of treatment
by several patients treated with
 xxxd387xxx  alone.
the efficacy was also apparent on objective criteria since the percentages of normalized prostatic
acid phosphatase levels were higher in the  xxxd2725xxx -treated
groups, as well as the numbers of
patients with a decreased number of metastases on
bone scan.
when subjective
and objective criteria were
pooled as proposed by the npcp to evaluate the
percentages of patients who had progression of their
disease within the first 6 months of treatment the
differences between the  xxxd2725xxx 
and placebo
groups were of a similar magnitude in the 4 studies,
with 24-40% of patients in progression at 6 months
in the placebo groups compared to only 9-23% in
the  xxxd2725xxx  groups (table 1).
in two studies, there was a suggestion that the
addition of  xxxd2725xxx  may prolong survival time.
frequently reported undesirable symptoms were
hot flushes and gastro-intestinal symptoms, of similar
frequency in both  xxxd2725xxx  and placebo groups;
impaired visual adaptation to darkness (24% with
 xxxd2725xxx , 3% with placebo); and intolerance to
alcohol (15% with  xxxd2725xxx , 0% with placebo).
only few patients had to stop treatment because of
adverse events.

negative
feedback
exerted
by androgens
on the
secretion of lh by the pituitary [28].
(3) studies in prostate cancer: a non-comparative
study of the combination
of  xxxd2725xxx 
with either
orchiectomy
or  xxxd387xxx  in patients with advanced
cancer was reported by labrie et al.. to give very
good results, especially
in patients who had no
previous

hormonal

treatment,

 xxxd2725xxx 

with very few adverse

effects [‘_y].

four multicenter
double-blind
clinical trials in
prostate cancer were therefore initiated in order to
compare castration alone and the combination of
castration with the antiandrogen  xxxd2725xxx : all studies included patients with advanced prostate cancer
who had not received previous hormonal treatment,
with a life expectancy of at least 3 months and no
other life-threatening
disease. follow-up examinations were performed after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24
months of treatment. individual criteria, such as
pain, performance
status, primary tumor size,
metastases on bone scan and chest x-ray and  xxxg46xxx , were evaluated and the
npcp
(national
prostatic
cancer
project)
criteria[30] were used to determine the objective
response at each of the 6-monthly follow-ups.
the designs of the four studies varied slightly in
that: study i [31] was a dose-response
study and
three groups were compared: orchiectomy + xxxd2725xxx 
300 mglday;
orchiectomy +
 xxxd2725xxx 
150 mg/day; and orchiectomy + placebo; results
were reported for 160 patients followed for 6-36
months.
in study ii [32],  xxxd387xxx  500 pg/day + placebo
was compared to  xxxd387xxx  +  xxxd2725xxx  300 mg/day;
results on 49 patients followed for 6-36 months were
reported.
study iii [33] compared orchiectomy +  xxxd2725xxx 
300 mg/day
and orchiectomy + placebo;
(170
patients followed for 3-24 months).
in study iv [34] patients with stage c as well as
stage d prostate cancer were included (100 patients)
and were treated
either with orchiectomy+
 xxxd2725xxx 
300 mg/day or with orchiectomy +
placebo.

discussion

the antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd2725xxx  has been
demonstrated in animals and in man.
in four different double blind studies performed in
patients with metastatic prostate cancer who had not
received previous hormonal treatment, the combination of  xxxd2725xxx  with orchiectomy or  xxxd387xxx 

for patients with metastatic
disease, there were
several differences between the  xxxd2725xxx -treated

moreover,
when castration was achieved by the
 xxxg930xxx  analog  xxxd387xxx , the evolution of bone pain
during the first month of treatment suggests that
 xxxd2725xxx  may prevent the  xxxg930xxx  analog-induced
flare-up of the disease. on the rat prostate,  xxxd2725xxx 
treatment was able to inhibit the trophic effect due to
the early increase in testosterone
induced by
 xxxd387xxx .
the combination
of  xxxd2725xxx  with castration
seems therefore to be a step forward in the hormonal
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, with possible prolonged survival in two studies. however,
although adding  xxxd2725xxx  to castration will improve symptoms and objective tumor regression rate
by preventing growth of androgen-dependent
tumor
cells, such treatment has no impact on hormoneindependent tumor cells. these, as shown in the
experimental
tumor model, probably
continue
growing and eventually cause a relapse of the disease. an additional non-endocrine
therapy might
further improve the results obtained with the association of castration and  xxxd2725xxx .
