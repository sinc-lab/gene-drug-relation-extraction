(received 13 april 1982/accepted 2 june 1982)
we investigated the activity of carbonic anhydrase in blood-free perfused white skeletal
muscles of the rabbit. carbonic anhydrase activities were measured in supernatants and
in triton extracts of the particulate fractions of white-skeletal-muscle homogenate by
using a rapid-reaction stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a ph electrode. an average
carbonic anhydrase concentration of about 0.5,um was determined for white skeletal
muscle. this concentration is about 1% of that inside the erythrocyte. some 85% of the
muscle enzyme was found in the homogenate supernatant, and only 15% appeared to be
associated with membranes and organelles. white-skeletal-muscle carbonic anhydrase
was characterized in terms of its michaelis constant and catalytic-centre activity
(turnover number) for co2 and its inhibition constant towards  xxxd2058xxx . these
properties were identical with those of the rabbit erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx ,
suggesting that a type-c enzyme is present in white skeletal muscle. affinity
chromatography of muscle supernatant and of lysed erythrocytes showed that, whereas
rabbit erythrocytes contain about equal amounts of carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes b
and c, the b isoenzyme is practically absent from white skeletal muscle. similarly,
 xxxd2058xxx -inhibition curves suggested that white skeletal muscle contains no
carbonic anhydrase a. it is concluded that white skeletal muscle contains essentially one
carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme, the c form, most of which is probably of cytosolic
origin.

skeletal muscle has long been thought to be one of
the few tissues in which carbonic anhydrase is not
present (roughton, 1935; maren, 1967). roughton
(1935) concluded that a catalysis of the interconversion
co2

hco3-

by carbonic anhydrase might even be unfavourable
for the removal of metabolically produced co2 from
muscle cells, since the cell membranes can be
expected to be highly permeable for co2 but not for
hco3-. more recently, evidence has been accumulated indicating that carbonic anhydrase does occur
in skeletal-muscle tissue and may serve to accelerate
the release of co2 from muscle tissue and its uptake
by blood. kawashiro & scheid (1976) showed that a
facilitation of co2 transport occurs across layers of
skeletal-muscle tissue, and it is probable that a
muscle carbonic anhydrase is responsible for this
enhancement of co2 transport. effros & weissman
(1979) concluded that in skeletal muscle a carbonic
anhydrase is accessible from the capillary bed that
vol. 205

speeds up co2 exchange between blood and tissue.
zborowska-sluis et al. (1974) reported that the
space of distribution of hco3- in the blood-free
hind limb of dogs is decreased by the specific
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. thus
functional studies show that significant carbonic
anhydrase activities must be present in skeletal
muscle.
koester et al. (1977) and carter et al. (1978)
isolated a new carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme. type
a, from red skeletal muscle. carbonic anhydrase a
has an extremely low specific activity and is highly
acetazolamide-resistant. it thus appears questionable whether the above-mentioned functional effects
of acetazolamide treatment, which were in part
achieved with relatively low doses of the inhibitor,
can be attributed to the carbonic anhydrase a of
red-skeletal-muscle fibres. we have therefore investigated the possibility that a high-activity acetazolamide-sensitive carbonic anhydrase is also present in
skeletal muscle, and report in the present paper on
the activity and properties of such an enzyme in
white skeletal muscle.

methods
preparation of skeletal-muscle tissue homogenate
all experiments were performed with skeletalmuscle tissue from the hind limbs of adult rabbits
weighing 2-3 kg. the tissue was rendered blood-free
by perfusion with dextran solution. for assessment
of contamination of the perfused muscles with
erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, the erythrocytes of
the rabbits' circulating blood were labelled with 5"cr
before the artificial perfusion was started. approx.
20ml of the rabbits' erythrocytes was exchanged
for rabbit erythrocytes that had been loaded with
51cr as described by gray & sterling (1950). after
1 h, catheters were inserted into the abdominal aorta
and the caval vein, through which the hind limbs
were perfused with a 6% (w/v) solution of dextran
(dextran 60000; knoll a.g., ludwigshafen, west
germany) equilibrated with co2/o2 (1:9) at 370c.
the perfusion was continued until the outflowing
perfusion fluid was free of erythrocytes, usually for
several hours. this long perfusion time, during which
the hind limbs were almost continuously moved or
the muscles were massaged, proved to be necessary
to achieve a nearly complete removal of erythrocytes from the tissue. the specific radioactivity of
the muscles perfused in this way was 1/20000th to
1/200000th of that of the erythrocytes in the
circulating blood before the perfusion was started.
this implies that erythrocytes occupy a volume
fraction of less than 0.0001 of the perfused muscles
(for details see gros et al., 1980).
at the end of the perfusion the muscles of the hind
limbs were excised and cut into pieces approx.
5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm in size. red-skeletal-muscle
and white-skeletal-muscle pieces were separated
according to appearance. only white-skeletal-muscle
pieces free of any reddish or brownish tinge were
collected, frozen in liquid n2 and homogenized in a
mikro-dismembrator (braun, melsungen, west
germany). after thawing, the homogenate was
centrifuged at 30000g for 1 h without prior addition
of buffer. the supernatant was decanted and used
for determinations of carbonic anhydrase activity
after suitable dilution. in some cases this supernatant was re-centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h, but no
significant changes in carbonic anhydrase activity
resulted. haem concentration in these white-skeletalmuscle supernatants was .3 um, whereas it was
>30m in identically prepared red-skeletal-muscle
supernatants. this indicates that the present preparation of white skeletal muscle was largely free of
haemoglobin as well as myoglobin. to assess
carbonic anhydrase associated with the particulate
fractions of white-skeletal-muscle tissue, the pellet
obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate was
again frozen and thawed, then resuspended in 4vol.
of 0.9% nacl and again centrifuged at 30000g for

w. siffert and g. gros

1 h. the supernatant was decanted and the procedure repeated five to seven times until no carbonic
anhydrase activity was detectable in the supernatant washing solution. the final pellet was
incubated in 8vol. of buffer containing 10mmtris/hc1, 0.3 m-sucrose and 0.5% triton x- 100
(ph 8.0) and stirred for 2 days. the suspension was
then centrifuged at 30000 g for 1 h. the supernatant
was concentrated in an amicon unit equipped with a
pm10 membrane (amicon, witten, west germany),
dialysed against the desired buffer, a step that also
removed most of the triton, and was then used for
measurements of carbonic anhydrase activity.
preparation of lysed rabbit erythrocytes
lysed rabbit erythrocytes were prepared by twice
washing rabbit erythrocytes in 0.9% nacli, lysing
them in 3 vol. of distilled water, then adding
sufficient naci to restore the ionic strength to 0.15 m
and centrifuging at 30000g for 30min to remove
erythrocyte 'ghosts'. for determinations of carbonic
anhydrase activity, small volumes of the clear lysate
were added to the desired buffers.
determination of carbonic anhydrase activity
carbonic anhydrase activities were determined by
using a rapid-reaction stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a ph-sensitive glass electrode as previously described (crandall et a!., 1971; gros et al.,
1976). muscle extracts or haemoglobin sofutions
were appropriately diluted in c02-free buffer and
rapidly mixed in this apparatus with co2 solutions
that had been prepared by equilibrating unbuffered
0.15 m solutions of nacl or naf with various
co2/n2 mixtures. the reaction occurring between
the (acid) co2 solution and the (nearly neutral)
buffer solution is a hydration of co2, which is
accompanied by a release of protons. the resulting
ph change was recorded and the initial slope of the
ph trace, together with the buffer capacity of the
solution, were used to calculate the initial rate of the
co2-hydration reaction. by subtracting the independently determined uncatalysed hydration rate,
the rate of co2 hydration due to carbonic anhydrase
catalysis was obtained. the catalysed reaction rate
was usually at least 10 times the uncatalysed rate.
the determinations of enzyme activity were done
in either 30 mm-imidazole/hcl buffer containing
0.15m-naci or 10mm-sodium  xxxd285xxx  buffer containing 0.15 m-naf. enzymes were characterized in
terms of their inhibition constants towards  xxxd2058xxx , k;, their catalytic-centre activity (turnover number), kcat, and their michaelis constant,
km. temperature was 25 0c throughout.
inhibition constants
these were derived from measurements of initial
catalysed co2-hydration rates at various concen1982

k; values were derived from such data as follows. to

(total)  xxxd2058xxx  concentration, [itot.], a secondorder polynomial of the form

(1)

was fitted. assuming non-competitive inhibition
(maren et al., 1960; leibman & alford, 1960;
maren & wiley, 1968) it can be shown that the
coefficients obtained from a second-order regression
analysis have the following meanings:
a = kcat.[etot.][co2iki/(km+ [c02])

(2)

b = [etot.1-k1

(3)

c = -(km+

[c02c)/([co2 kcat.)

(4)

where kcat is the catalytic-centre activity of the
enzyme, [etot ] its total concentration, [co2] the
initial concentration of co2, and km the michaelis
constant of the enzyme for co2. by using the fitted
values of a, b and c,- the total enzyme concentration
can be calculated from
[etot ] = b/2 + b2/4-a .c
and the inhibition constant can be obtained from
k, =-a c/[etot.i
thus inhibition experiments of the type shown in
fig. 1 allowed us to estimate both [etot.] and kv. in
addition, kcat/(km + [co2]) as a measure of the
specific activity of the enzyme could be derived from
the value of the coefficient c and the known co2
concentration. it may be noted that this kind of
analysis, when a high-affinity inhibitor such as
 xxxd2058xxx  is being used, yields reliable estimates of the coefficients b and c, but the coefficient a
is obtained with less accuracy because, owing to the
low k1 value, it is relatively small. this implies that
the values of [etot.] (note that under the present
conditions a * c < b2/4) and the specific activity
kcat/(km + [co2]) are generally determined with
greater precision than k1. another possible source of
error for k1 results from the disturbance of the
equilibrium between enzyme and inhibitor that is
caused by the 1: 1 mixing of the ethoxzolamideincubated diluted supernatant with the enzyme- and
inhibitor-free co2 solution. after the mixing process in the stopped-flow apparatus the equilibrium
between enzyme and inhibitor will be re-established
by partial dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor
complex. kinetic experiments with other sulphonamides (kernohan, 1966; lindskog et al., 1971)
indicate that this reaction may be slow, with a
half-time similar to that of the uncatalysed co2

vol. 205

hydration, and thus not complete in the initial stages
of the catalysed co2 hydration observed in the
present work. the degree of enzyme inhibition
during the initial reaction phase may therefore be
greater than expected from the total concentration of
inhibitor present after mixing. it can be shown that
this can lead to an underestimation of k, by at most
50% of the true value but does not affect the
estimated values of the total enzyme concentration,
the specific activity or kcat.
michaelis constants and catalytic-centre activities
these were determined from measurements of
catalytic rates at different co2 concentrations.
plotting 1/vcat versus 1/[co2] yielded straight lines
(see fig. 2), which allowed us to calculate
vmax.= [etoj.]kcat. and the michaelis constant km.
inserting values of km and [co2] together with the
value of c (as obtained from an inhibition experiment) into eqn. (4) yielded the catalytic-centre
activity kcat.
affinity chromatography
carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes b and c were
separated by affinity chromatography as described
by siegmund et al. (1976). p-aminomethylbenzenesulphonamide (serva, heidelberg, west germany)
was coupled to cnbr-activated sepharose (pharmacia, freiburg, west germany). the affinity
column (1.5cm x 50 cm) was pre-equilibrated with
0.1 m-tris/hcl buffer, ph 8.9. samples were dialysed
against the same buffer before application to the
column. non-specifically bound proteins were desorbed with 0.1 m-tris/l m-kci buffer, ph8.9.
 xxxg287xxx  was eluted with 0.1 mkh2po4/1m-kcl buffer, ph6.7, and  xxxg293xxx  was eluted with 0.1 m-acetate/1 m-kcl
buffer, ph 5.5. fractions containing isoenzymes b
and c respectively were pooled, concentrated and
extensively dialysed against the desired buffer before
use for measurements of carbonic anhydrase
activity.

both constants are almost identical for the muscle

inhibition experiments like those shown in fig. 1
were performed with purified preparations of
erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases b and c and
muscle carbonic anhydrase (i.e. type c, see below),
as obtained by affinity chromatography of lysed
erythrocytes and of white-skeletal-muscle supernatant respectively. to avoid the almost complete
inhibition of the b isoenzyme by 0.15 m-c1- (maren
et al., 1976) and its partial inhibition by imidazole
(khalifah, 1971), these experiments were performed
in 0.15m-naf with 1omm- xxxd285xxx  as buffer. the
ph was 7.5, the co2 concentration was 2.3 mm and
the temperature was 250c. k, values and specific
activities for muscle isoenzyme c and erythrocyte

isoenzyme c were calculated from the data and are
shown in table 2. although the absolute values of k,
and kcat./(km + [c021) for these purified preparations deviate significantly from those obtained in
dilute haemoglobin solutions and muscle supernatants (see the discussion section), they indicate
clearly that the properties of the white-skeletalmuscle isoenzyme closely agree with the properties
of the erythrocyte c isoenzyme but differ markedly
from those of the erythrocyte b isoenzyme.

diluted in imidazole/nacl buffer; km = 4.1 mm. the data points were used to calculate linear regressions (r > 0.99),
which yielded the michaelis constants, kmi which are also shown in table 1. the lines shown represent the computed
regression equations.

0.15m-nacl and 30mm-imidazole buffer (0), the
ph was 7.0 and the temperature was 250c. for
both solutions straight lines with correlation coefficients r> 0.99 were obtained. from the regression coefficients similar km values of 3.2 mm for
the muscle enzyme and 4.1 mm for the erythrocyte
enzyme were calculated. fig. 2(a) shows that
imidazole has no marked effect on the kinetic
properties of the muscle enzyme: replacement of
imidazole by  xxxd16xxx  (a) or phosphate
(0) did not alter the catalytic rates and led to almost
identical values of km and vmax.'
from these km values and the specific activities
kcat/(km + 0.0023 m) as derived from inhibition
curves, the catalytic-centre activities were estimated
to be 90000s- for the white-skeletal-muscle enzyme
and, not significantly different, 120000s- for the
erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. we conclude that
there is good agreement between the kinetic properties of the muscle enzyme and the erythrocyte
carbonic anhydrase (whose activity under the
present conditions of 0.15 m-cl- is constituted solely
by the type-c isoenzyme; see the discussion

section).
isoenzyme pattern
to study the distribution of carbonic anhydrase
isoenzymes, white-skeletal-muscle supernatant and

vol. 205

lysed erythrocytes were subjected to affinity chromatography. determinations of carbonic anhydrase
activity on the peaks of isoenzymes b and c as
eluted from the affinity column showed that about
20% of the total carbonic anhydrase activity in
erythrocytes is contributed by isoenzyme b and 80%
by isoenzyme c when the inhibitory cl- is absent.
with the specific activities of isoenzymes b and c as
given in table 2, this leads to a molar ratio of 1 : 1
for [b isoenzyme]/[c isoenzymel in rabbit erythrocytes, a value in excellent agreement with the
findings reported by mcintosh (1970). in contrast,
in white-skeletal-muscle supernatant only approx.
1% of the total carbonic anhydrase activity is due to
isoenzyme b and 99% originates from isoenzyme c.
similarly, the carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme a,
which has been shown to occur in high concentrations in red skeletal muscle (koester et al.,
1977; siffert et al., 1980), appears to be absent from
white skeletal muscle. this is evident from fig. 1(a),
which shows that carbonic anhydrase activity in
white-skeletal-muscle supernatant is almost completely inhibited at 0.l pm- xxxd2058xxx , whereas
inhibitor concentrations of 0.4 mm for acetazolamide (koester et al., 1977) and 60m for  xxxd2058xxx  (w. siffert & g. gros, unpublished work)
are necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of carbonic
anhydrase a. we conclude that carbonic anhydrase

w. siffert and g. gros

564

isoenzymes a and b are practically absent from
white-skeletal-muscle cytosol of the rabbit and that
the carbonic anhydrase activity detected there is
almost solely due to the isoenzyme c. in rabbit
erythrocytes, on the other hand, isoenzymes b and
c are both present to an appreciable extent.

carbonic anhydrase associated with particulate
fractions
carbonic anhydrase activity in the particulate
fractions was determined by using the pellet obtained by centrifugation of white-skeletal-muscle
homogenate. after freezing and thawing and subsequent extensive washing of this pellet to remove all
free carbonic anhydrase (see above), carbonic
anhydrase could be extracted by treating it with
triton. activity measurements in this extract
showed that about 10-15% of the total carbonic
anhydrase activity of white-skeletal-muscle tissue
seems to be associated with the particulate fractions. no attempt was made to identify the subcellular structures responsible for this enzyme
activity, and it should be noted that some activity
may also have been extracted from unbroken cells
rather than from membranes and organelles. the
enzyme was not characterized in terms of inhibition
constants or kinetic properties, but it was found that
the carbonic anhydrase of the pellet extract was
almost fully inhibited by 0.2,um- xxxd2058xxx ,
which rules out isoenzyme a as the form present in
the particulate fractions.
discussion
properties of rabbit erythrocyte carbonic an-

hydrases
the properties of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase
shown in table 1 are those of the c isoenzyme, since
the b isoenzyme can be expected to be fully inhibited
under conditions of 0.15 m-c1- (maren et al., 1976).
this is confirmed by the excellent fit achieved by
applying eqn. (1) (which uses only a single value of
k, and kcat.) to the inhibition data of fig. 1(b), and
thus suggests the presence of only one active
isoenzyme. comparisons of the present findings are
therefore made below with other data for various c
isoenzymes. literature data on rabbit carbonic
anhydrase suitable for comparison exist only for km.
mcintosh (1970) reported for the erythrocyte c
isoenzyme at 45mm-cl-/5 mm-phosphate, ph 7.0
and 0°c a km value of 6.2mm, which agrees
reasonably well with the present value of 4mm,
obtained at 0.15 m-cl-, ph 7.0 and 250c, if km can
be assumed to be independent of temperature
(sanyal & maren, 1981). the k1 for  xxxd2058xxx 
shown in table 1 is of the order of that reported by
maren (1967) for the human c isoenzyme. it is
30-40 times lower than the k1 value that we

obtained for acetazolamide with the same erythrocyte lysate under identical conditions (24nm). this
latter value is in excellent agreement with the ki for
acetazolamide found by skipski & scott (1980) for
the rabbit c isoenzyme and by several workers for
the c isoenzymes of other species (see maren,
1967).
the catalytic-centre activity of 120000s- given
in table 1 is clearly indicative of a type-c
isoenzyme. it is, however, about only one-quarter of
the kcat value obtained by khalifah (1971) for the
human c isoenzyme at ph 7.0 in the absence of
inhibitory anions such as cl-. part of this discrepancy is probably due to the presence of
0.15m-cl- in our erythrocyte lysates, a cl- concentration that is known to cause approx. 40%
inhibition of the human c isoenzyme (maren et al.,
1976). indeed, the specific activity, kcat./(km +
[c021), given in table 2 for the isolated erythrocyte
c isoenzyme, is almost twice the value found in the
crude lysate (see table 1). this higher value is very
probably due to the absence of inhibitory anions and
buffers, and to the somewhat higher ph value in the
purified enzyme preparation as compared with the
crude lysate.
the rabbit erythrocyte b isoenzyme exhibits a
specific activity one-quarter of that of the c
isoenzyme under the present conditions. at ph 8.2
and 0oc, koester et al. (1977) reported an even
more pronounced difference in specific activity of
rabbit b and c isoenzymes, that of the former being
one-seventh of that of the latter. another marked
difference between the b and c isoenzymes is their
affinity towards  xxxd2058xxx . the ki of the
erythrocyte b isoenzyme is almost 10 times that of
the c isoenzyme. this finding is at variance with
maren's (1967) observation of identical k1 values of
human b and c isoenzymes for  xxxd2058xxx , but
in keeping with the properties of many other
sulphonamides, which show an approximately 10fold greater affinity towards the c isoenzymes as
compared with the b isoenzymes.
it may be noted that the inhibition constants
obtained for the isolated c isoenzymes (table 2) are
significantly higher than those obtained for the same
isoenzyme in the crude erythrocyte and whiteskeletal-muscle preparations (table 1). at least part
of this discrepancy seems to be due to the difference
in ph between the crude preparations (ph 7.0) and
the purified enzyme solutions (ph 7.5). this is
suggested by the finding of a 3-fold increase in k1
when the ph of the erythrocyte lysate was raised to
7.5.

carbonic anhydrase of white-skeletal-muscle tissue
of the rabbit
the present results show that, in contrast with
earlier conclusions (roughton, 1935; maren, 1967),

1982

carbonic anhydrase in white skeletal muscle
 xxxg293xxx  is present in white-skeletalmuscle tissue. most of this enzyme appears to be
cytosolic, and only a minor part may be associated
with membranes or organelles. the identification of
this carbonic anhydrase as a type c isoenzyme
derives from the following findings. (a) inhibition
constants and kinetic properties of the carbonic
anhydrase of crude white-skeletal-muscle extracts
are identical with those of lysed erythrocytes (figs. 1
and 2 and table 1); the latter are known to contain
only one active isoenzyme,  xxxg293xxx .
(b) the catalytic-centre activity of the muscle
carbonic anhydrase (table 1) is significantly higher
than those reported for b isoenzymes in the presence
(mcintosh, 1970; maren et al., 1976) and even in
the absence of inhibitory ions (khalifah, 1971;
sanyal & maren, 1981). (c) affinity chromatography of white-skeletal-muscle homogenates yields
a type-c isoenzyme, but only insignificant amounts
of  xxxg287xxx . furthermore, the present
data show that the carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme a
is absent from white-skeletal-muscle tissue. this
follows from the full inhibition that is obtained with
0.1 pm- xxxd2058xxx  (fig. 1), a concentration that
is known to leave carbonic anhydrase a almost
unaffected (koester et al., 1977; siffert et al., 1980).
we conclude that white-skeletal-muscle tissue of the
rabbit contains essentially one carbonic anhydrase
isoenzyme, the c form.
a crucial assumption, that the carbonic anhydrase that we find in muscle homogenate is not
due to erythrocytes still present in the muscles after
perfusion, forms the basis of this conclusion and
deserves discussion. the 100-fold higher concentration of carbonic anhydrase that we find in
erythrocytes than in muscle homogenate (table 1)
implies that the presence of 1% (v/v) erythrocytes in
the perfused muscle could produce the c-isoenzyme
activities that we find in the white-skeletal-muscle
supernatants. there are three lines of evidence to
suggest that erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase indeed
contributes negligibly to the measured muscle
enzyme activities. (a) the determinations of 51cr
radioactivity in white-skeletal-muscle homogenates
indicate that only 0.01-0.001% (v/v) of erythrocytes were present in the muscles after perfusion (for
details see gros et al., 1980). thus at most 1% of
the present muscle enzyme activities should be due
to residual erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. (b)
measurements of haemoglobin concentrations in the
supernatants argue in a similar way against the
presence of significant amounts of erythrocytes in
these muscles. from the a 410, the haem concentration in the supernatants was estimated to be
3 pm. assuming that all of this haem represents
haemoglobin, a maximum of 0.015% for the volume
fraction of erythrocytes in the perfused muscles can
be inferred. (c) the isoenzyme patterns in erythrovol. 205

565
cytes and in white skeletal muscle are different.
although b-isoenzyme activity is almost absent
from white-skeletal-muscle homogenates, it contributes about 20% of the total enzyme activity in
erythrocytes when inhibitory ions are not present.
these findings taken together appear to support
strongly the conclusion that the c isoenzyme found
in white skeletal muscles originates from this tissue
and not from erythrocytes.

possible localization and physiological significance
of white-skeletal-muscle carbonic anhydrase
the present data show that most of the whiteskeletal-muscle carbonic anhydrase is of cytosolic
origin and only 10-15% is associated with the
particulate fractions. which tissue components and
subcellular structures are possible sources of this
carbonic anhydrase? in the recent literature, the
following structures have been implicated as possible
sites of carbonic anhydrase activity in muscle tissue:
mitochondria, endothelial cells and sarcoplasm.
(1) mitochondria. dodgson et al. (1980) obtained evidence for the presence of carbonic anhydrase in the matrix of skeletal-muscle mitochondria of guinea pigs. it is possible that the
carbonic anhydrase that we find in the particulate
fractions actually is associated with the mitochondria. however, since electron microscopy of the
homogenates obtained with our homogenization
procedure (r. dermietzel, personal communication) revealed a significant number of damaged
mitochondria, it is possible that mitochondrial
carbonic anhydrase has been unmasked and is
present in the muscle supernatants. the following
rough calculation attempts to estimate how much
carbonic anhydrase can be expected to appear in the
supernatant when all mitochondrial enzyme is set
free. by using the 'standardized catalytic constant'
(intramitochondrial catalysed rate constant per
mitochondrial protein concentration), as determined
by dodgson et al. (1980) for guinea-pig muscle,
0.067s-'*mg-l*ml, and a value of 200mg*ml-' for
the mitochondrial protein concentration (b. t.
storey, personal communication), one calculates an
intramitochondrial rate constant for the catalysed
co2 hydration of 13.4 s-'. assuming that white
skeletal muscle contains 3% (v/v) mitochondria
(weibel, 1979), one would expect a rate constant of
approx. 0.4 s-1 for the whole tissue if all mitochondria are disrupted. with rate constant =
[etot.] kcat./ (km + [c021), the physiological co2
concentration [co21 =1 mm, and km and kcat.
from table 1, one then estimates a maximal
concentration of 17 nm for mitochondrial carbonic
anhydrase in the supernatant. this is only 3.5% of
the enzyme concentration that we actually find in
white-skeletal-muscle supernatant. although this
calculation is valid for guinea-pig rather than rabbit

566
skeletal muscle, it appears probable that mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase, if present in the
supernatants investigated in the present work, can
account for only a minor part of the enzyme actually
detected there.
(2) sarcoplasm and endothelial cells. indirect
evidence suggests that a major part of the intracellular space of skeletal-muscle tissue contains
carbonic anhydrase (zborowska-sluis et al., 1974).
however, the muscles studied by these authors were
of the mixed type, and it is thus possible that the
effects they observed are due to the isoenzyme a,
which is known to be present in high concentrations
in red fibres (koester et al., 1977; carter et al.,
1978; tashian et al., 1980; siffert et al., 1980).
indeed, histochemical evidence obtained by lonnerholm (1980) suggests that  xxxg293xxx  is
not present in muscle fibres but occurs in high
concentrations in capillaries, an observation also
reported by ridderstrale (1979). although the
specificity of the histochemcal method employed by
ridderstrale (1979) and lonnerholm (1980) has
been questioned (muther, 1977; gay, 1980), the
cytoplasm of endothelial cells must be considered as
a possible location of the cytosolic c isoenzyme. it
may be noted that effros & weissman (1979), on
the basis of h'4c03-' 4co2-wash-out curves, hypothesized that muscle carbonic anhydrase may be
associated with the endothelial plasma membranes
and serve to accelerate co2 equilibration in the
capillary. besides the mitochondria, the endothelial
cell membrane may thus constitute a source of the
carbonic anhydrase that can be extracted from the
particulate fractions. a definite answer to the
question of isoenzyme-c localization in white
skeletal muscle has to await further physiological
and histochemical studies.
we are indebted to dr. r. e. forster and dr. b. t.
storey (philadelphia) for letting us know the details of
their determinations of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase
and for helpful discussions. we thank dr. r. dermietzel
(essen) for electron-microscopic investigation of the
muscle homogenate.
