abstract
this study investigates the involvement of a2-adrenergic receptors (ar) in mouse brain induced by a low dose of
methamphetamine (meth, 2 mg/kg). immunohistochemical studies show that a2a-ar increased in the dentate gyrus
area of the hippocampus 24 h after five repeated administrations of meth. the hippocampal a2a-ar proteins rose 3.2fold when compared to the saline-administered mice. the other adrenergic receptor, a1d-ar, were not changed by the
treatment. moreover, ao-subunits of gtp-binding proteins (gao), one of the downstream molecules of a2a-ar, was also
increased by the treatment. these suggest that the repeated administration of low-doses of meth causes quantitative
changes of the signaling of a2a-ar in the mouse hippocampus.

a2-adrenergic receptors (a2-ars) have physiological and
pharmacological roles in the central nervous system. three
subtypes of a2a, a2b, and a2c-ar have been isolated
[7,12,19], which are all coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and regulation of ion channel through gi and go
proteins. a2-ars have been shown to play a role in inhibiting the release of norepinephrine or other neurotransmitters
in the presynaptic nerve endings of synapse and peripheral
nerves systems [3,4]. as shown in previous study, the a2aar have protective effects on the depression and anxiety in
knock-out model mice [16]. other studies suggested that
a2c-ar could influence the locomotor and temperature
control function using genetic altered expression mouse
model of a2c-ar [14]. moreover, a2-ar antagonists have
a counter effect for locomotor activity and startle response
in rats and mice [15]. however, the brain region-specific
functions of a2-ar subtypes were not well defined.
methamphetamine (meth) and related psychostimulants
are known to block dopamine re-uptake and increase dopamine release [1,18]. recently, it was shown that the dopaminergic neurons at nucleus accumbens synchronized with the
hippocampal neurons [5], and other studies suggested that the
administration of d-amphetamine caused increase of extracel* corresponding author. tel.: 181-42-995-1484; fax: 181-42996-5191

lular norepinephline in rat frontal cortex [20]. since these
results provided for the projection of dopaminergic neurons
to noradrenergic neurons, we hypothesized that the noradrenergic neurons in spatial region of brain play a role in the
meth-induced behavioral changes. the purpose of the
present study was to investigate an involvement of brain  xxxg82xxx  on meth-induced behavioral changes in mouse.
male ddy mice (tokyo experimental animal co., tokyo,
japan) weighing 20–30 g were housed on 12/12 h light/dark
cycle. mice were allowed free access to standard diet and
water. all procedures involving animal preparation were
approved by the national defense medical college animal
committee. all behavioral measurements were made in the
same time from 13.00 on day 3 of the administration. the
ambulatory activity was measured in tilting-type ambulometer amb-m20 (o’hara & co., ltd., tokyo, japan) as
described previously [8]. mice were placed in the experimental chamber (20 cm diameter, 18 cm high) 30 min
before the injection of meth. mice were treated with saline
vehicle (10 ml/kg, s.c.) or meth (2 mg/kg, s.c.), then
immediately placed in the chamber (time 0). data collection
lasted for a duration of 120 min (10 min £ 12).
the animals were treated meth or saline every 3 days
for repeated administrations. twenty-four hours after the
fifth meth or saline administration, the mice were sacrificed, then the brains were excised and embedded in tissuefreezing medium. for nissel’s staining, the brain slices (10

meth administration. the meth-induced ambulatory activities
were measured by tilting type ambulometor. the mice received
injection of meth (2.0 mg/kg) or saline every 3 days. the ambulatory activity was then measured for periods of every 10 min.
the present data indicate a typical behavioral effect of meth

previously [9]. neighboring slices were used for immunohistochemical study. the a2a-ar immuno-reactive protein
was visualized with affinity purified anti-a2a-ar goat polyclonal antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz,
ca) and using abc kit and manufacture’s protocol.
twenty-four hours after the fifth meth or saline administration the animal was anaesthetized with an injection of
sodium pentobarbital and sacrificed. the brain was excised
and separated brain regions (hippocampus, cereblum,
prefrontal cortex, and olfactory bulb). then each brainregion were homogenized with extraction buffer (50 mm
tris–hcl (ph 7.4), 1 mm edta, 1 mm (ethylenebis(oxononitrilo))tetraacetate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyfluoride). the extract was centrifuged to remove cell
debris. samples (30 mg of total protein) were analyzed by
conventional sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (sds-page) as described earlier [10].
the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from sds-page
gel to polyvinylidene difuoride membranes was performed
as described previously [17]. for immuno-detection of the
transferred proteins, the procedure of burnette [2] was used
except that the second antibody was linked to horseradish
peroxidase, then detected by ecle (amersham-pharmacia). for quantification of the immunoblot, densitomeric
analysis was performed with a nih image analyzer.
data represent group means ^ sem for each experiment.
statistical analysis was performed using student’s t-test,
and p , 0:01 was considered highly significant, p , 0:05
was considered significant.

ambulatory activity was hyper activated by repeated
administration of meth in mice. as shown fig. 1, repeated
administration of meth (2 mg/kg, every 3 days, s.c.)
caused the increase of maximum response in ambulatory
activity and the hyperactivity was sustained. reverse tolerance of meth was observed during treatment.
to investigate the brain region-specific changes of a2-ar
by repeated administration of meth, we employed immunohistochemical studies using anti-a2a-ar antibody. we
first tested for a specificity of the antibody in brain crude
extract by immunoblot analysis. the a2a-ar protein was
detected in a single band (data not shown). as shown in fig.
2a, the expression of a2a-ar increased in the dentate gyrus
(dg) area of hippocampus compared with saline-injected
control mouse. however, the morphology of pyramidal cell
layer on hippocampus did not change compared with the
control (fig. 2b). these results indicated that repeated

administration of meth increased the a2a-ar in hippocampus without any remarkable morphological changes.
a2a-ar has been known to couple with gi and go proteins
and transduce the extracellular adrenergic input into intracellular signaling such as protein kinases and cations. we
investigated the expression of a2a-ar and its downstream
molecule gao in hippocampus by immunoblot analysis. in
repeated meth administered group, the a2a-ar expressions significantly increased to 3.2-fold in hippocampus
compared with control group (p , 0:01, student’s t-test,
fig. 3a), however, the upregulation did not observe in
prefrontal cortex, olfactory bulb and cerebellum (fig. 3a).
similar results observed in hippocampal a2a-ar mrna
expression by using reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction methods (data not shown). moreover, in the
treatment groups, the hippocampal gao expressions also
significantly increased in comparison with the control
(p , 0:05, student’s t-test, fig. 3b). however, one of
other adrenergic receptors, a1d-ar did not significantly
change (fig. 3c). these indicate that repeated administrations of meth result in the quantitative increase of a2a-ar
and gao in mouse hippocampus.
previous studies on psychostimulants have shown that the
effects of psychostimulants involved the changes on dopamine release from substantia nigra. meth, one of the
psychostimulants, has also been known to activate the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. recently, one study
suggested that the nucleus accumbens can be synchronized
by synaptic inputs from the hippocampus [5]. repeated
meth administration induced hyper-activation of ambulatory activity in mouse. the phenomenon is known to be the
model of reverse tolerance by repeated meth administration. however, the molecular mechanisms of reverse tolerance remain unclear. therefore, we supposed that meth
may modulate the function of adrenergic neurons associating with the activated function of dopaminergic neurons,
and the changes on noradrenergic neurons may contribute
the formation of reverse tolerance induced by repeated
meth administration.
the main finding of this study is that the hippocampal a2aar increased during repeated meth administration in mice.
as shown in figs. 2 and 3, the hippocampal a2a-ar expression increased by the treatment of repeated meth administration. the possibilities of relations between a2a-ar and the
ambulatory hyperactivity have been proposed by others who
showed the intraperitoneal administration of yohimbine, an
a2-ar antagonist, decreased amphetamine-induced rotation
in rat, and uk14304, an a2-ar agonist, increased the effect
[11]. the a2c-ar has been reported to be highly expressed in
hippocampus and other brain regions. other studies for a2car, lack of the a2c-ar increased and over-expressed the
receptor decreased the locomotor activity induced by damphetamine [13]. because the a2c-ar also activated when
norepinephrine was released in hippocampus, we cannot
exclude the possibility that a2c-ar or other ar also were
associated with meth-induced locomotor activity.

as the results from the studies of a forced swim test using
a2a-ar knock out model mouse showed that the receptor
have some roles in the anxious effect [16]. in addition, the
combined administration of a2-ar antagonist idazoxan and
d2/3 dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride raised dopamine output in the medial prefrontal cortex [6]. combined
with our results, a2-ar can modulate the dopamine signaling, since dopaminergic neurons project into adrenergic
hippocampal neurons. the hippocampus has known to
relate the formation of memory and neuronal plasticity.
moreover, the dg region has known under a projection
from entorhinal cortex, however, we cannot exclude the
reasons why repeated meth treatment induced the upregulation of a2a-ar at dg region in hippocampus.
our results show that the repeated administration of
meth up-regulates the a2a-ar in the dg region of hippocampus and gao in hippocampus. these suggest that the
hippocampal a2a-ar play some roles in the formation or
sustaining of reverse tolerance by meth. although the
downstream signaling of hippocampal a2a-ar on the
formation of reverse tolerance remain unclear, these results
may be useful in the study for elucidation of therapeutic
target in the meth abuse in human.
