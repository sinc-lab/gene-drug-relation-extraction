abstract
inhaled glucocorticoids are widely used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without much evidence of efficiency in this
disease where neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology. this prompted us to test the effects of several currently used inhaled
and systemic glucocorticoids on human neutrophil apoptosis. beclomethasone, budesonide, dexamethasone,  xxxd2145xxx ,
hydrocortisone and prednisolone inhibited apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by flow cytometric analysis,
annexin-v binding and morphological analysis. the maximal inhibition of apoptosis was 50–60%. the order of potency was fluticasone
propionate žec 50 0.6 " 0.2 nm. f budesonide žec 50 0.8 " 0.2 nm. ) dexamethasone f  xxxd1853xxx  beclomethasone f
hydrocortisone. the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids were reversed by mifepristone. moreover, glucocorticoids slightly enhanced the
inhibitory effect of granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx  žgm-csf. on neutrophil apoptosis. the present data suggests that

1. introduction
neutrophils are crucial to host defense mainly through
phagocytosing and destroying infectious agents žsmith,
1994.. however, they are also thought to be an important
cellular mediator of tissue damage in many acute and
chronic inflammatory conditions žhaslett, 1999.. as other
human phagocytes, neutrophils die through apoptosis during the resolution of inflammation žhaslett, 1999.. this
process determines the rapid clearance of intact senescent
neutrophils by macrophages and thus provides an injurylimiting granulocyte clearance mechanism žcox et al.,
1995b; haslett, 1999.. distinct from necrosis that loses
cell membrane integrity and releases the dying cell’s contents in an uncontrolled and possibly harmful manner,

apoptotic cell is phagocytosed intact without releasing its
contents žhaslett, 1997.. human neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis at a rapid rate in vitro and in vivo žcox
et al., 1995; haslett, 1999.. this process can be inhibited
by granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx 
žgm-csf. žbrach et al., 1992; dibbert et al., 1999. and
leukotriene b 4 žhaslett, 1999.. the lifespan of the mature
circulating neutrophil is estimated to be between 8 and 20
h but can be increased to a few days when the cell is
recruited into the tissue žmoulding et al., 1998..
it is reasonable to suppose that failure to remove neutrophils and their toxic products from tissues could result
in chronic persistent inflammation. neutrophils are thought
to be involved in a variety of inflammatory lung disorders.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is believed to be
the consequence of chronic airway inflammation žbarnes,
1998; jeffery, 1999.. increased numbers of inflammatory
cells and high levels of inflammatory mediators have been
reported in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue in
the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

of neutrophils and neutrophil activating inflammatory mediators such as  xxxg562xxx  and leukotriene b 4 as well as
neutrophil-derived oxidants and proteases are found in the
airway lumen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
žjeffery, 1999.. neutrophils thus seem to be involved in
the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
žbarnes, 1998; o’byrne and postma, 1999..
glucocorticoids are effective in controlling the inflammation in asthma and several other chronic inflammatory
diseases. however, the effect of inhaled glucocorticoids in
the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is
controversial. though there are some studies to suggest
that inhaled glucocorticoids may be of benefit in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, many reports suggest that
the inflammatory process in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease is resistant to the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids, especially in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease žpostma and kerstjens, 1999; van
grunsven et al., 1999.. in some studies in patients with
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, glucocorticoids have been reported not to reduce, but even to
increase, neutrophil numbers in induced sputum žhoshino
and nakamura, 1996; inoue et al., 1999; keatings et al.,
1997.. therefore, we hypothesized that inhaled glucocorticoids at low concentrations could delay neutrophil apoptosis.
the aim of the present study was to find out whether
the currently used inhaled glucocorticoids beclomethasone,
budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  affect constitutive
apoptosis or gm-csf-afforded human neutrophil survival.
a preliminary insight on the mechanism of action of
inhaled glucocorticoids was made by investigating whether
their effects are mediated via  xxxg1601xxx .

2. materials and methods
2.1. neutrophil isolation and culture
neutrophils were isolated under sterile conditions.
briefly, a buffy-coat preparation ž50 ml. from normal
individuals was collected into 10 ml of acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant and hydroxyethyl  xxxd2538xxx . white
blood cell pellet was laid onto  xxxd3253xxx  and centrifuged at
700 = g for 30 min at 20 8c. the mononuclear cell layer
was discarded and the phagocyte pellet was resuspended
and washed in hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  žhbss..
contaminating red blood cells were lysed by hypotonic
lysis. the remaining granulocytes were washed twice with
rpmi 1640. the neutrophils were counted using microscopic examination in kimura stain, and the purity of
neutrophil population was ) 98%. the cells were resuspended at 2 = 10 6 cellsrml, cultured for the indicated time
ž37 8c; 5% co 2 . in prmi 1640 ždutch modification. with
10% fetal calf serum plus antibiotics.

2.2. flow cytometry
2.2.1.  xxxd3027xxx  staining
neutrophil apoptosis was determined by  xxxd3027xxx  staining of dna fragmentation and flow cytometry

solution, fixed by 70% ethanol and incubated in ice for 30
min. the cell pellet was resuspended in  xxxd3027xxx 
solution ž25 mgrml in pbs., incubated for 60 min and
measured by flow cytometry. the cells showing decreased
relative dna content were considered as apoptotic.
2.2.2. annexin-v
annexin-v binding and analysis by flow cytometry
were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. briefly, the cells ž5 = 10 5 . were washed in pbs
solution and suspended in 195 ml of binding solution ž10

was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. the cells
were then washed and resuspended in binding buffer containing 10 mgrml  xxxd3027xxx  and analyzed by flow
cytometry.
2.3. morphology
neutrophils were spun onto cytospin slides ž1000 rpm,
7 min., fixed in methanol and stained with may–
grunwald–giemsa.
the cells showing the typical features
¨
of neutrophil apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, nuclear
coalescence and nuclear chromatin condensation were considered as apoptotic žhaslett, 1997.. when the percentages
of apoptotic cells obtained by morphological analysis and
flow cytometric analysis of relative dna content were
compared, a significant correlation between the two methods was observed ž r s 0.922, p - 0.00001, n s 75..

4. discussion
the present results show that the commonly used inhaled glucocorticoids beclomethasone, budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  inhibit constitutive apoptosis of human
neutrophils in vitro. our study extends the previous reports
žkato et al., 1995; liles et al., 1995; meagher et al., 1996.
which showed that dexamethasone andror methylprednisolone delay neutrophil apoptosis.

369

the ec 50 values of budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  for the inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis were 0.8
and 0.6 nm, respectively. the maximal concentration in
plasma ž cmax . has been reported to be in a range of
2.2–5.6 nm for budesonide and 0.18–2 nm for fluticasone
after administration by inhalation žmeibohm et al., 1998;
thorsson et al., 1994, 1997.. the tissue concentrations of
budesonide and fluticasone in the lung have been reported
to be substantially higher than those in plasma žbarnes,
1998; barnes et al., 1998; hogger
and rohdewald, 1998;
¨
thorsson et al., 1997.. thus, the inhibitory effects of
budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  on neutrophil apoptosis are obtained at drug concentrations that are found in
the lung during inhalation therapy. the ec 50 of beclomethasone in inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis in the present study was 20 nm, whereas cmax has been reported to
be 2.3 nm after inhalation žharrison et al., 1999.. however, it may be possible that beclomethasone concentrations locally in the lung would be high enough to inhibit
neutrophil apoptosis. this idea is supported by the finding
of hoshino and nakamura ž1996. that treatment with
inhaled beclomethasone increased the numbers of neutrophils in bronchial biopsies. the ec 50 values of prednisolone and hydrocortisone in inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis were 13 and 38 nm, respectively. the cmax of
prednisolone was reported to be 500 nm after oral administration žbarnes et al., 1998.. intravenous hydrocortisone
produced cmax of 1–1.6 mm žaalto-korte and turpeinen,
1995.. hence, prednisolone and hydrocortisone inhibit
neutrophil apoptosis at highly clinically relevant drug concentrations.
there is evidence that neutrophil numbers are increased
in the airways of subjects with status asthmaticus and
during exacerbations of asthma. analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial biopsies žwenzel et al.,
1997. and induced sputum žjatakanon et al., 1999; louis et
al., 2000. revealed significantly increased neutrophil numbers in severe asthma as compared with mild asthma or
normal control subjects. at present, it is not known whether
neutrophilic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis
of severe asthma or whether it is an iatrogenic phenomenon. in the study of jatakanon et al. ž1999., all
patients with severe asthma associated with neutrophilia
were treated with oral prednisolone combined with highdose inhaled steroids. in the study of wenzel et al. ž1997.,
severe asthma was classified based on the use of oral
steroids at doses equivalent or greater than 20 mgrday
prednisolone. furthermore, louis et al. ž2000. reported
that the numbers of neutrophils in induced sputum in those
asthmatic patients who were treated with high doses of
inhaled glucocorticoids were increased, but not in those
treated with low doses. since oral and inhaled glucocorticoids increase neutrophil survival by reducing apoptosis at
clinically relevant drug concentrations, it is possible that
treatment with high dose glucocorticoids contributes to the
neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthma.

glucocorticoids are effective to control the inflammation in asthma and several other chronic inflammatory
diseases. in contrast, the role of glucocorticoids in the
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not
clear. there are more than 100 studies that have investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on the inflammation in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease žpostma and kerstjens, 1999. but the results are conflicting. neutrophils have
been shown to be present in increased numbers in induced
sputum in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease žjeffery,
1999; o’byrne and postma, 1999.. since it is now well
recognized that apoptosis provides a granulocyte clearance
mechanism that would tend to limit tissue injury and
promote resolution of inflammation žhaslett, 1999., a delay in constitutive apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids
may increase the numbers of neutrophils in the airways of
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. furthermore, during apoptosis neutrophils lose their capacity
to degranulate žhaslett, 1999.. thus, modulation of apoptosis in neutrophils by glucocorticoids regulates their
afunctional longevityb žcox, 1995.. thus, the inhibition of
constitutive neutrophil apoptosis by currently used inhaled
or oral glucocorticoids may inhibit the course of resolution
of the neutrophilic inflammation. therefore, there exists a
possibility that long-term treatment with oral or inhaled
glucocorticoids may not be of benefit to the patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
the basic mechanism of glucocorticoid actions is that
glucocorticoids penetrate into the cell and bind to  xxxg1601xxx  molecules in the cytoplasm žbarnes et
al., 1998.. glucocorticoids differ in their receptor affinity.
the agents that have high glucocorticoid-receptor affinity,
e.g.  xxxd2145xxx  and budesonide žtable 1., were
more potent in inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis than beclomethasone and dexamethasone. an antagonist of the
 xxxg1601xxx , mifepristone žagarwai, 1996.,
completely reversed the effects of budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  on neutrophil apoptosis. this suggests that
budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  modulate neutrophil
apoptosis through  xxxg1601xxx . we žzhang et
al., 2000. and others žadachi et al., 1996; meagher et al.,
1996. have previously shown that inhaled glucocorticoid
enhance human eosinophil apoptosis at clinically relevant
drug concentrations via  xxxg1601xxx . the reason for the opposing effects of glucocorticoids on
eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis remains unknown at
the present.
neutrophil apoptosis can be delayed by inflammatory
mediators such as gm-csf ždibbert et al., 1999.. glucocorticoids are effective in inhibiting gm-csf synthesis in
several human cell types žbarnes et al., 1998.. recently,
dibbert et al. ž1999. reported that peripheral blood and
bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil apoptosis is delayed in
inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, pneumonia and idiopathic fibrosis. furthermore, gm-csf and
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor were shown to be

the main survival-prolonging factors for neutrophils in
these diseases ždibbert et al., 1999.. thus, it is possible
that the slight enhancement of the anti-apoptotic effect of
gm-csf by inhaled glucocorticoids has clinical relevance
in some situations. it is, however, difficult to estimate the
clinical net effect by glucocorticoids on neutrophilic inflammation as they ža. inhibit gm-csf production, žb.
inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and žc. enhance gm-csf-afforded survival.
in conclusion, we have shown that the currently used
inhaled glucocorticoids žbudesonide and  xxxd2145xxx . inhibit human neutrophil apoptosis at clinically
relevant drug concentrations via an effect on  xxxg1601xxx .
