produces acyl-coas, which are primary substrates for energy
use via ␤-oxidation and for the synthesis of triacylglycerol,
phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and sphingomyelin, and are
the source of signaling molecules like ceramide, diacylglycerol,
and  xxxd208xxx  (1, 2). acyl-coas up-regulate uncoupling
protein in brown fat and key enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ␤-oxidation; are essential for vesicle trafficking;
and play a critical role in the transport of  xxxd2154xxx  into cells
by making transport unidirectional. protein esterification with
 xxxd2681xxx  and palmitate anchors proteins to specific membranes and enables them to function correctly (3). thus, acylcoas participate in a large number of cellular reactions that
involve lipid synthesis, energy metabolism, and regulation, but
how acyl-coas are partitioned or directed toward these diverse
synthetic, degradative, and signaling pathways is not
understood.
currently, five different rat acs cdnas have been cloned,
each the product of a different gene (4 – 8). rat  xxxg47xxx –5 share a
common structural architecture and are further classified into
two subfamilies based on amino acid identity and fatty acid
preference (4 – 8).  xxxg47xxx , acs2, and acs5 make up one subfamily with about 60% homology to one another, and  xxxg48xxx  and
 xxxg49xxx  make up a second subfamily with about 70% homology to
each other and 30% similarity to  xxxg47xxx . within each subfamily,
the acs isoforms differ in their mrna size, tissue distribution,
and transcriptional regulation.  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 are all
expressed in liver.
studies with the acs inhibitors triacsin and troglitazone
suggested that long chain acyl-coas are functionally channeled
toward specific metabolic fates. in most of these studies, de
novo glycerolipid synthesis was severely inhibited, whereas
phospholipid reacylation and ketone bodies formation was less
impaired. inhibition of fatty acid incorporation into cholesterol
esters varied with cell type, being completely blocked in human
fibroblasts and only moderately decreased in hepatocytes. for
example, in hepatocytes, triacsin c did not alter oxidation of
pre-labeled intracellular lipid, but did inhibit triacylglycerol
synthesis 40% and 70% in hepatocytes isolated from starved
and fed rats, respectively (9). additionally, in hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats, troglitazone blocked incorporation of
 xxxd2777xxx  into triacylglycerol, but not into phospholipid (10). in
addition, troglitazone inhibited ketone body production. in
human fibroblasts, triacsin c blocked the incorporation of
[3h]glycerol into phospholipid by 80% and the incorporation
into triacylglycerol by 99%, indicating severely impaired acy-

inhibition studies have suggested that acyl-coa synthetase (acs, ec 6.2.1.3) isoforms might regulate the use
of acyl-coas by different metabolic pathways. in order
to determine whether the subcellular locations differed
for each of the three acss present in liver and whether
these isoforms were regulated independently, noncross-reacting peptide antibodies were raised against
 xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5.  xxxg47xxx  was identified in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane
(mam), and cytosol, but not in mitochondria.  xxxg49xxx  was
present primarily in mam, and the 76-kda acs5 protein
was located in mitochondrial membrane. consistent
with these locations,  xxxd2684xxx , an inhibitor of
 xxxg49xxx , inhibited acs activity 47% in mam and 28% in
endoplasmic reticulum. troglitazone, a second  xxxg49xxx  inhibitor, inhibited acs activity <10% in microsomes and
mitochondria and 45% in mam. triacsin c, a competitive inhibitor of both  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , inhibited acs
activity similarly in endoplasmic reticulum, mam, and
mitochondria, suggesting that a hitherto unidentified
triacsin-sensitive acs is present in mitochondria.  xxxg47xxx ,
 xxxg49xxx , and acs5 were regulated independently by fasting and re-feeding. fasting rats for 48 h resulted in a
decrease in  xxxg49xxx  protein, and an increase in acs5. refeeding normal chow or a high sucrose diet for 24 h after
a 48-h fast increased both  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  protein expression 1.5–2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies.
these results suggest that  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  may be linked
to triacylglycerol synthesis. taken together, the data
suggest that acyl-coas may be functionally channeled to
specific metabolic pathways through different acs isoforms in unique subcellular locations.

(5 ␮g of total protein), were analyzed by western blot with antibodies raised against full-length  xxxg47xxx  (a) or unique peptides from  xxxg47xxx  (b),  xxxg49xxx 
(c), acs5 (d), or the flag epitope (e). the mc lane represents liver microsomes blotted with  xxxg47xxx  peptide antibody. protein antibody complexes
were visualized by chemiluminescent detection of horseradish peroxidase linked to goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse igg. the molecular mass values
of recombinant  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 were 68, 74, and 76 kda, respectively, on this gel system.

experimental procedures

materials—[2-3h]glycerol and [9,10-3h]palmitate were from amersham pharmacia biotech. glycerol,  xxxd2832xxx -coa, atp, and bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (essentially fatty acid-free) were from sigma. triacsin c
(⬎95% pure) was from biomol. troglitazone was the gift of dr. steven
jacobs, glaxosmithkline. a polyclonal antibody to rat  xxxg47xxx  was the
gift of dr. paul watkins, kennedy krieger institute.
animals—animal protocols were approved by the university of north
carolina (unc), chapel hill, nc and university of alberta institutional
animal care and use committees. male and female (150 g) harlan
sprague-dawley rats were housed on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with
free access to water. control animals had free access to purina rat chow.

fasted animals were sacrificed after being without food for 48 h. refed
rats were sacrificed after being fed purina rat chow or a high sucrose diet
(69.5% sucrose, dyets, inc.) for 24 h after a 48-h fast.
subcellular fractionation—for subcellular localization experiments,
liver cytosol, microsomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria-associated membrane (mam), and mitochondria were isolated from male rats by a method (19) modified by vance (20). liver
total membrane fraction, microsomes, and mitochondria were isolated
from female rats by differential centrifugation (21) in the presence of
protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin) for subcellular localization and nutritional regulation experiments. fractions were stored in aliquots at
⫺80 °c. protein concentrations were determined by the bca method
(pierce) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.
immunoblotting—peptides corresponding to regions of rat  xxxg47xxx ,
 xxxg49xxx , and acs5 that show poor amino acid conservation ( xxxg47xxx ,
mevhelfryfrmpelidir;  xxxg49xxx , eihsmqsveelgskpenssi;
acs5, kcgiemlslhdaenl) were synthesized, purified, and coupled
to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the unc/pmbb micro protein chemistry facility. rabbit antibodies to these peptides and to purified mitochondrial  xxxg1808xxx  were raised commercially in new zealand white rabbits (immunodynamics, la jolla, ca). antibodies to pemt2 were made
as described previously (22). proteins were separated on an 8% (or 12%
for pemt2) polyacrylamide gel containing 1% sds and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (bio-rad). for chemiluminescent
detection, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating the
membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
igg and picowest reagents (pierce). for quantitation, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with 0.5 ␮ ci of 125i-protein a
(icn), exposed to a phosphor screen, and quantified with the molecular
dynamics storm 840 and imagequant software.
enzyme assays—diacylglycerol acyltransferase was assayed at 23 °c
with 200 ␮m  xxxd690xxx ,2-diolein and 25 ␮m [3h] xxxd2832xxx -coa (23), acyl-coa
synthetase was assayed at 37 °c with 5 mm atp, 250 ␮m coa, and 50
␮m [3h]palmitate (24), and glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase
( xxxg1808xxx ) was assayed at 23 °c with 300 ␮m [3h]glycerol-3-p and 112.5
␮m  xxxd2832xxx -coa in the presence or absence of 2 mm  xxxd2684xxx 
to inhibit the microsomal isoform (25). microsomal  xxxg1808xxx  was estimated by subtracting the  xxxd2684xxx -resistant activity (mitochondrial  xxxg1808xxx ) from the total. all assays measured initial rates.
[3h] xxxd2832xxx -coa (26) and [3h]glycerol 3-phosphate (27) were synthesized enzymatically.
results

 xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 are located in different subcellular
fractions—the relative distribution of acs activity in rat liver
is 7% in peroxisomes, 20% in mitochondria, and 73% in microsomes (28). since measurements of acs activity do not distinguish among the different acs isoforms, we localized each
isoform in order to determine whether it is evenly distributed
or, instead, located in a specific subcellular membrane.
we raised isoform-specific rabbit antibodies against unique
peptides present in  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , or acs5 because an antibody
raised against purified  xxxg47xxx  not only recognized purified recombinant  xxxg47xxx , but also recognized purified recombinant
 xxxg49xxx  and acs5 (fig. 1a). the cross-reactivity is most likely

lation of glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol via the de novo synthetic pathway from glycerol
3-phosphate (11). incorporation of [14c] xxxd2777xxx  into triacylglycerol was also blocked 95%, consistent with impaired acylation
via the de novo pathway; however, incorporation into phospholipids was not impaired, suggesting that separate pools of acylcoas exist and that the reacylation pathway is functionally
separate from de novo glycerolipid synthesis. taken as a whole,
these studies suggest that there are functionally independent
acyl-coa pools within cells, and that acyl-coas might be channeled toward specific fates rather than being freely available
for all possible enzymatic reactions.
yeast provide clear evidence for functionally different acslinked pathways. in candida lipolytica, studies using acs
mutants indicate that acs i activates exogenous  xxxd2154xxx  for
glycerolipid synthesis and acs ii activates them for ␤-oxidation (12). in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the acs proteins faa1p
and faa4p account for 99% of yeast c14-coa and c16-coa
activity (13) and activate exogenously derived  xxxd2154xxx  destined for phospholipid synthesis (14). faa4p is specifically
needed for myristoylation of protein substrates (15), and faa2p
is required for peroxisomal ␤-oxidation (16, 17). yeast acs
isoforms are also differentially inhibited by triacsin c (18).
from these data, gordon’s group (17) concluded that there are
differences in location or accessibility of those acyl-coas that
are derived from endogenous synthesis and those acyl-coas
formed from exogenously provided  xxxd2154xxx . thus, genetic
studies in yeast link specific acs isoforms to different pathways that use acyl-coas.
we examined  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 in rat liver, which
contains a variety of pathways that use acyl-coas, in order to
determine whether the subcellular locations, inhibition by specific inhibitors, and nutritional regulation might link the different acs isoforms with different metabolic pathways. our
data indicate that  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 are present in different subcellular membranes; that acs activity is inhibited by
triacsin c, troglitazone, and nem to varying degrees in these
subcellular fractions; and that nutritional changes regulate
each acs isoform independently.

fig. 2. location of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 in rat liver subcellular fractions. cytosol (c), microsomes (mc), fractions enriched in
smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ser), fractions enriched in rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer), mam, crude mitochondria (cmt), and pure
mitochondria (pmt) fractions (100 ␮g of protein) were analyzed by
western blot with antibodies against  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , or acs5 (a) and
 xxxg1808xxx  or  xxxg1482xxx  (b) . molecular mass is indicated on the right.

somal fraction, which comprises rough er, smooth er, and
mam (fig. 2a). the molecular mass is smaller than that predicted by the cdna sequence (78 kda), but in agreement with
the size of the recombinant  xxxg47xxx  run in the same manner (fig.
1). a prominent  xxxg47xxx  band was also detected in the cytosol,
but cytosolic acs specific activity was only 2.6% that of microsomal acs specific activity (3.5 versus 132 nmol/min/mg of
protein). although  xxxg47xxx  was present in crude mitochondria,
which contain the mam fraction, no  xxxg47xxx  band was observed
in purified mitochondria (fig. 2a), as we reported previously
(9).  xxxg49xxx  (74 kda) was enriched in the mam fractions from rat
liver (fig. 2a) and chinese hamster ovary cells (data not
shown), and was only very weakly detected in microsomal and
mitochondrial fractions. in some preparations,  xxxg49xxx  was detected as a doublet with a larger 75-kda protein (data not
shown), consistent with alternative start sites as described for
the human  xxxg49xxx  homologue (30). the acs5-specific antiserum
detected a protein of 76 kda in the mitochondrial fraction (fig.
2a), 73- and 74.5-kda proteins in er, and a 74.5-kda protein in
cytosol and mam fractions (fig. 2a). the 76-kda protein
agrees with the size predicted by the cdna sequence and
migrates to the same position as recombinant acs5. taken
together, these data indicate that  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 each
have unique distributions in liver subcellular membranes.
inhibition of acs activity in liver subcellular fractions—
since  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 were present in different subcellular membranes and the recombinant proteins expressed in

due to the high degree of sequence similarity found among
 xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5. the specificity of each of our peptide
antibodies was verified by immunoblot analysis of each isoform
specific antibody against purified recombinant rat  xxxg47xxx ,
 xxxg49xxx , and acs5, each with a c-terminal flag epitope (29).
peptide antibodies for  xxxg49xxx  and acs5 each recognized only
the correct acs isoform (fig. 1, c and d). the  xxxg47xxx  peptide
antibody failed to recognize recombinant  xxxg47xxx -flag (fig. 1b)
because the initial two amino acids of the n-terminal sequence
had been altered to clone the recombinant protein. however,
the recombinant  xxxg47xxx -flag protein detected by the flag antibody and the major band in rat liver microsomes detected by
the  xxxg47xxx  peptide antibody migrate to the same position, showing that the  xxxg47xxx  peptide antibody recognizes native  xxxg47xxx 
(fig. 1e).
rat liver was fractionated by two different methods. one
method used a sucrose gradient to further purify microsomes
into er1 and er2 fractions that are enriched in rough and
smooth er, respectively (19, 20). a percoll gradient separated crude mitochondria into mam and purified mitochondria (19, 20). the second method used only differential centrifugation (21) and produced mitochondria that had very
little microsomal contamination and microsomes that primarily contained er membranes, as well as the mam fraction. the purity of each fraction was ascertained by enzymatic assays for the er enzymes dgat and nem-sensitive
 xxxg1808xxx , and for the mitochondrial enzyme nem-resistant
 xxxg1808xxx  and an by immunoblots for mitochondrial  xxxg1808xxx  and
for  xxxg1482xxx , the mam marker. these markers showed that the
microsome fraction was free of mitochondrial contamination
because little nem-resistant  xxxg1808xxx  activity was present (table i) and no mitochondrial  xxxg1808xxx  protein was detected by
immunoblotting (fig. 2b). in the er and mam fractions
purified using gradients, 11–28% of the  xxxg1808xxx  activity was
resistant to nem (table i), indicating that these fractions
were somewhat contaminated with mitochondria. no  xxxg1482xxx 
was detected in the er and purified mitochondria by immunoblot analysis (fig. 2b), indicating that these fractions were
not contaminated with the mam fraction. very low dgat
and nem-sensitive  xxxg1808xxx  activities were measured in the
purified mitochondria (table i), indicating little contamination with er. dgat activity was enriched in the mam fraction compared with er, consistent with previous results (40).
the microsome fraction (100,000 ⫻ g pellet) also has high
dgat activity, and it contains the mam fraction, as evidenced by the presence of the mam-specific marker,  xxxg1482xxx 
(fig. 2b).
the location of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 in rat liver was
determined by western blot analysis of various subcellular
fractions.  xxxg47xxx  (68 kda) was strongly detected in the micro-

fig. 4. troglitazone specifically inhibits acs activity in mitochondria-associated membrane. microsomes, mitochondria, or

increasing concentrations of troglitazone (0 –50 ␮m). data are representative of two independent experiments and are presented as percentage of acs activity remaining after treatment with inhibitor. control specific activities (100%): microsomes ⫽ 89 nmol/min/mg;

c, thiazolidinediones, and nem (29), we hypothesized that
these inhibitors would affect acs activity differently in each
fraction. triacsin c (10 ␮m), which inhibits purified recombinant  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  by 60%, and does not inhibit acs5 (29),
decreased acs activity in microsomes, mitochondria, and
mam by 60% (fig. 3). this result is surprising because the only
acs we identified in mitochondria was acs5, which is resistant to inhibition by triacsin c (29). the mitochondria we assayed were free of contamination by the mam fraction as
determined by the absence of  xxxg1482xxx  on an immunoblot (data not
shown). therefore, the observed inhibition suggests that mitochondria contain a hitherto undescribed triacsin-sensitive acs.
troglitazone and nem, two specific  xxxg49xxx  inhibitors, were
more selective inhibitors of acs activity in liver subcellular
fractions. troglitazone  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m decreased acs activity 25% in
mam, but had no effect on activity in the microsomal or mitochondrial fractions (fig. 4). with 50 ␮m troglitazone, acs activity was inhibited 45% in mam, again with little effect on
microsomal or mitochondrial acs activity. nem, a second

(n ⫽ 4) were analyzed by quantitative western blot analysis with
peptide antibodies against  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , or acs5 and 125i-protein a.
the blots were exposed to a phosphor screen for quantitation with a
molecular dynamics storm 840 system. the blots shown are representative, and the numbers below the bands indicate the -fold change
compared with normally fed rats. the mean and s.d. for each are as
follows:  xxxg47xxx , n (1 ⫾ 0.05), f (0.8 ⫾ 0.05), r (1.8 ⫾ 0.1), s (1.9 ⫾ 0.02);
 xxxg49xxx , n (1 ⫾ 0.08), f (0.5 ⫾ 0.07), r (1.6 ⫾ 0.15), s (2 ⫾ 0.12); acs5,

 xxxg49xxx  inhibitor, decreased acs activity 50% in mam and only
27% in the smooth er fraction (fig. 5). these results are
consistent with the immunolocalization of  xxxg49xxx  preferentially
to the mam fraction.
nutritional regulation of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 in liver—if  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 are linked to different metabolic
pathways, one might expect that each isoform would be regulated differently under conditions of fasting and re-feeding.
acs activity and protein expression were measured in liver
microsomes and mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation from control rats, from rats fasted for 48 h, and from rats
fasted for 48 h and then refed either purina rat chow or a high
sucrose diet for 24 h. the microsomes contained mam, and the
mitochondria were free of contamination by mam as determined by immunoblot with antibody against  xxxg1482xxx , the mamspecific marker (data not shown). acs activity, assayed with
palmitate as the fatty acid substrate, was similar in microsomes and in mitochondria isolated from control rats (18.5 ⫾3.5
and 14.3 ⫾ 2.9, respectively), 48-h fasted rats (21.8 ⫾ 0.9 and
11.9 ⫾ 2.9, respectively), and rats fed purina rat chow for 24 h
after a 48-h fast (15.1 ⫾ 4.5 and 14.2 ⫾ 2.4, respectively).
although total acs activity was unchanged by nutritional
status,  xxxg47xxx  protein expression increased 1.8- and 2-fold with
purina chow and high sucrose re-feeding, respectively (fig. 6).
 xxxg49xxx  protein expression also increased with re-feeding (50%

long chain acyl-coa synthetase catalyzes the initial step
required for oxidation, elongation, and desaturation of fatty
acids; for the synthesis of complex lipids and acylated proteins;
and for a variety of signals that regulate cellular metabolism
(1, 2). it had been thought that the acss synthesize a common
pool of acyl-coas, which move freely within cell membrane
monolayers and have equal access to the numerous metabolic
pathways in which they participate. however, genetic studies
in yeast link specific acs isoforms to different pathways that
use acyl-coas (12–17). in addition, in cultured cells, inhibitors
of acs (triacsin and troglitazone) selectively alter the synthesis and oxidation of cellular lipids, suggesting that the acs
isoforms might be differentially inhibited, and that triacsinsensitive isoforms might be functionally linked to de novo glycerolipid synthesis whereas triacsin-resistant acs isoforms
might be functionally linked to phospholipid reacylation pathways and to ␤-oxidation (9 –11, 31–33). these data, together
with our results showing that triacsin c inhibits recombinant
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , but not acs5, and that thiazolidinediones
specifically inhibit  xxxg49xxx  (29), suggested that acyl-coa entry
into specific metabolic pathways could be mediated by the
action of individual acs isoforms.
in this paper, we show that  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 differ in
their subcellular distribution, suggesting that, as in yeast,
acyl-coas may be channeled toward specific metabolic pathways. functional channeling could occur if a particular acs
were located in a membrane that contained only a handful of
specific pathways that use acyl-coas or if each acs were
physically associated with the downstream enzymes in a specific pathway. to examine this question, we investigated the
subcellular locations of the three acss expressed in rat liver.
 xxxg47xxx , the first cloned and best studied acs isoform, has been
reported to be present in virtually every subcellular fraction.
an early study with a polyclonal antibody raised against  xxxg47xxx 
purified from microsomes reported that  xxxg47xxx  protein was present in rat liver microsomes, peroxisomes, and mitochondria
(34). others have identified  xxxg47xxx  in glut4 vesicles (35) and
in plasma membrane (36) from fat cells. acs activity has been
reported in nuclei from rat liver (37), and in cytosol of pc12
neurons (38), but the acs isoform was not determined in either
case. our studies showed  xxxg47xxx  protein in the microsomal
fraction of rat liver.  xxxg47xxx  does not appear to contribute to the
acs activity present in mitochondria, since our peptide antibody did not detect  xxxg47xxx  in purified mitochondria under any
nutritional condition, consistent with our previous study (9).
although  xxxg47xxx  had been identified in rat mitochondria with
an antibody raised against an acs purified from microsomes
(34), the antibody may have recognized epitopes on non- xxxg47xxx 
isoforms present in mitochondrial membranes as we showed in
fig. 1.
we also detected a significant amount of  xxxg47xxx  protein in rat
liver cytosol. although a cytosolic location is consistent with
measurements of  xxxd2777xxx  acs activity in the cytosol of pc12
cells, acs activity and  xxxg47xxx  protein expression are absent in
the cytosol from 3t3-l1 adipocytes (36). since, in liver cytosol,
acs specific activity was barely detectable, our antibody may
cross-react with a non-acs cytosolic protein of the same molecular mass. alternatively, cytosolic  xxxg47xxx  may be largely
inactive, but become active after it translocates to intracellular
membranes as occurs with  xxxd2777xxx -activated  xxxg756xxx , the bacterial

acs (39).
the subcellular locations of  xxxg49xxx  and acs5 have not been
reported previously. some of the mitochondrial acs activity is
accounted for by acs5, since we detect a 76-kda protein (in
agreement with the predicted size of acs5) specifically in
mitochondria. the acs5 peptide antibody also detects 73- and
74.5-kda proteins in er and mam, and a 74.5-kda protein in
cytosol and mam fractions. both  xxxg48xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  can use
alternative start sites (6, 30), but no alternative start site is
present in the acs5 sequence that would yield proteins smaller
by 1.5 or 3 kda. the smaller immunoreactive proteins might
represent acs5 after proteolytic cleavage, or it may be that the
acs5 peptide antibody recognizes a novel acs isoform with a
high degree of sequence similarity.
 xxxg49xxx  is highly enriched in the mam fraction, an er-like
membrane that can be found in mitochondria or er preparations, depending on the cell fractionation method employed.
the mam fraction contains  xxxg1482xxx -2, microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein, apob, and high specific activities of acyl-coa:
cholesterol acyltransferase, dgat (40), and phosphatidylserine synthase-1 and -2 (41). vance’s group has hypothesized
that mam may be involved in importing lipids into mitochondria (42) or in very low density lipoprotein assembly (40).
inhibition studies with purified  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5
showed that triacsin c inhibited only  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , whereas
the thiazolidinediones and nem were more selective and only
inhibited  xxxg49xxx  (29). consistent with these inhibition studies
and the location of the three isoforms in liver, troglitazone and
nem had their maximum effects in mam where  xxxg49xxx  is
located. similarly, triacsin c was a potent inhibitor of acs
activity in er and mam, membranes that contain both  xxxg47xxx 
and  xxxg49xxx . surprisingly, however, triacsin c inhibited acs
activity in mitochondria to the same extent that it inhibited
activity in er (fig. 2). since the triacsin-resistant acs5 is the
only acs isoform detected in mitochondria, a hitherto unknown triacsin-sensitive acs may be present in mitochondria.
another possibility is that purified acs5-flag, which is not
inhibited by triacsin, does not have the same properties as the
in situ enzyme. we do not believe that this is the case, since the
flag epitope does not interfere with acs activity (29) and
triacsin c is unable to inhibit acs activity in an e. coli membrane fraction containing overexpressed acs5-flag (data not
shown).
because mam may be a specialized site for very low density
lipoprotein biosynthesis, the presence of  xxxg49xxx  in this fraction
and its inhibition by triacsin c suggests that  xxxg49xxx , like  xxxg47xxx ,
is linked to triacylglycerol synthesis. consistent with this hypothesis, we found that  xxxg49xxx  protein expression decreased
47% after a 48-h fast, and was up-regulated by re-feeding
either normal chow (50% increase) or a high sucrose diet (64%
increase). the most remarkable finding was the specific inhibition of recombinant  xxxg49xxx  by thiazolidinediones (29) and the
ability of troglitazone to specifically inhibit acs activity in
mam (fig. 3). it has been hypothesized that the mechanism by
which thiazolidinediones produce their anti-diabetic effects is
through their ability to lower plasma  xxxd2154xxx  (43). further study
is needed to determine whether thiazolidinediones are insulin sensitizers, in part, because of their inhibitory effect on  xxxg49xxx .
in humans, the gene for  xxxg49xxx  lies on the x chromosome and
is part of a large deletion that results in a human disorder that
combines alport syndrome with elliptocytosis, dysmorphic facies, and mental retardation (44). it is not known whether the
deleted  xxxg49xxx  contributes to these problems or whether the
disorder is associated with abnormalities in serum lipids. however, since expression of  xxxg49xxx  is highest in human brain, and
human and rat  xxxg49xxx  show a preference for  xxxd208xxx , it has

subcellular locations of acyl-coa synthetases 1, 4, and 5

been suggested that, in brain,  xxxg49xxx  might be critical for recycling  xxxd208xxx  into phospholipids that are sources for signaling molecules related to intellect and coordination (30).
consistent with its microsomal location and the powerful
triacsin-mediated inhibition of triacylglycerol synthesis in fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and hepg2 cells (11, 31–33),  xxxg47xxx  has
been linked to triacylglycerol synthesis.  xxxg47xxx  mrna is prominent in liver and adipose tissue (4), and in 3t3-l1 cells only
after they differentiate into adipocytes (45).  xxxg47xxx  mrna expression also increases in adipose tissue and muscle after
ppar␥ activation (46), and in liver after high dietary fat refeeding (4). the presence of  xxxg47xxx  in glut1 vesicles is hypothesized to be linked to vesicle trafficking, which requires  xxxd2832xxx -coa (35), but  xxxg47xxx  could, in fact, function to increase fatty
entry into cells in response to insulin stimulation. on the other
hand, liver  xxxg47xxx  is regulated by ppar␣ (46 – 48), whose activation is usually associated with the up-regulation of enzymes
of fatty acid oxidation. our finding that  xxxg47xxx  is present in er,
mam, and possibly peroxisomes2 provides a potential explanation, if the various physiological processes result in changes in
the amount of  xxxg47xxx  protein present in different subcellular
organelles (e.g. peroxisomes versus er). in fact, reciprocal differences in acs activity were observed in mitochondria and
microsomes after stimulation by cytokines, but, unfortunately,
the acs isoforms involved were not identified (49).
acs5 may be linked to the ␤-oxidation pathway because its
protein expression increased 80% after a 48-h fast. this increase in acs5 protein contrasts with a previous study that
reported a 50% decrease in acs5 mrna after a fast (8). it is
possible that the rate of acs5 protein turnover is decreased in
response to fasting. although the presence of a triacsin-sensitive acs linked to ␤-oxidation is consistent with previous observations that treatment of hepatocytes with triacsin c (10
␮m) results in a 30% decrease in acid soluble metabolites (9),
because recombinant acs5 is not sensitive to triacsin (29),
there must be a novel triacsin-sensitive acs in mitochondria.
many unique eukaryotic enzymes catalyze the same lipidbiosynthetic reaction (50). these enzymes are encoded by different genes and are often located in distinct cellular locations.
our findings show that  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 are located in
different liver subcellular membranes and that nutritional
changes regulate each isoform independently, consistent with
the hypothesis that eukaryotic systems have redundant lipidbiosynthetic enzymes in order to provide independent regulation of activity and compartmentalization of lipid pools (50).
