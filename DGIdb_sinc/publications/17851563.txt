inosine 50 -monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 ( xxxg1186xxx ) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo pathway for
purine synthesis and is a major target of the immunosuppressive drug  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa). few variants of the
 xxxg1186xxx  gene have been reported. the objective of this study was to identify and characterize  xxxg1186xxx  variants to
determine whether genetic variation contributes to differences in mpa response and toxicity in transplant patients.
seventeen genetic variants were identified in the  xxxg1186xxx  gene with allele frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 42.7%.
in this study, 191 kidney transplant patients who received  xxxd2677xxx  were genotyped for  xxxg1186xxx . two
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2278293 and rs2278294, were significantly associated with the incidence of biopsyproven acute rejection in the first year post-transplantation. future studies of the multifactorial nature of acute rejection
must consider  xxxg1186xxx  polymorphisms in mpa-treated patients.
inosine 50 -monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh) (ec
1.1.1.205) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of
de novo biosynthesis of guanine by driving  xxxd557xxx  (imp) to xanthosine monophosphate with the
reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). this
enzyme is the target of  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa), the active
constituent of the prodrug  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf),
which is widely used clinically to prevent allograft rejection
following solid organ transplantation.1 mpa is also used as
an immunomodulator in immune-related diseases such as
aids, lupus nephritis, myasthenia gravis, and immune
thrombocytopenic purpura.2–6 unlike other cell types, which
can use the salvage pathway for purine synthesis, lymphocytes are exclusively dependent upon the de novo pathway
catalyzed by impdh for the generation of guanosine
nucleotide.7,8 mpa uncompetitively, selectively, and reversibly inhibits this pathway and therefore inhibits cell
proliferation.
impdh has two isoforms named  xxxg1186xxx  and  xxxg1187xxx ,
and the genes that encode these proteins are located on two
different chromosomes.9  xxxg1186xxx  is located on chromosome
7 region q32.1 and is constitutively expressed in all tissues.

 xxxg1186xxx  shares 84% amino-acid homology with
impdh210,11 and has substrate affinities and ki values that
are virtually indistinguishable.12 in an  xxxg1186xxx -knockout
mouse model,  xxxg1186xxx  deletion inhibited t-cell activation
in response to  xxxd2676xxx  and anti-cd28 antibodies.13
although mpa has been shown to inhibit the activities of
both  xxxg1186xxx  and  xxxg1187xxx  isoforms in vitro,  xxxg1187xxx  is
4.8 times more sensitive to mpa inhibition than  xxxg1186xxx .14
several mutations in the impdh-binding site confer
variable degrees of resistance to mpa in the parasite
tritrichomonas foetus, and varying drug-sensitive forms of
this enzyme have been detected in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
however, few studies have been reported on impdh gene
variants in humans.15–17 recent findings have shown that
mutations in  xxxg1186xxx  cause autosomal-dominant retinitis
pigmentosa.18,19 no other changes in  xxxg1186xxx  that result in
a change in the genotype–phenotype relationship have been
described.
as maintenance of the balance between rejection and overimmunosuppression is difficult, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitoring of mmf have been proposed to
optimize drug dosage and the administration schedule.20

hale et al.21 previously reported that the area under curve
(auc) of mpa is inversely associated with the likelihood of
allograft rejection after renal transplantation in patients
receiving mmf. the relationship between mmf pharmacokinetic parameters and the risk of adverse effects is not as well
defined. considering the significant variability in the effects
of a given concentration of mpa, the therapeutic range for
the desired pharmacologic effect without adverse effects in
most patients is difficult to discern.22 interindividual
variability in impdh activity has been observed in healthy
volunteers as well as transplant patients.23,24 pharmacodynamic monitoring of impdh activity has been proposed,
and a significant relationship has been reported between
pretransplant impdh activity and clinical outcome after
renal transplantation.24 however, mpa is most frequently
administered to transplant patients without monitoring mpa
plasma concentrations, impdh concentrations, or other
relevant gene polymorphisms.
the considerable variability in baseline impdh activity
and mpa response may logically be under the control of
genetic variation within the impdh genes or in gene
expression. analysis of genetic variants could provide the
explanation for the variability of impdh activity and mmf
response in transplant patients. therefore, the objective of
this study was to identify  xxxg1186xxx  genetic variants in renal
transplant patients and to retrospectively look for the
association of these polymorphisms with leukopenia or
biopsy-proven acute rejection in renal transplant patients
receiving mpa.

results

to examine  xxxg1186xxx  genetic variation, 17 exons and the
intron–exon boundary regions were initially sequenced from
30 genomic dna samples from liver transplant patients.
seventeen genetic variants were identified in the  xxxg1186xxx 
gene. eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), including four exonic variants and seven intronic snps with
relatively high allele frequencies, were subjected to taqman
snp assay using an abi 7900 real-time pcr system. the
identified polymorphisms and their frequencies are listed in
table 1. table 2 lists the demographic data for the 191 renal
transplant patients who were divided into patients with and
without an episode of biopsy-proven acute rejection in the
first postoperative year. no significant demographic difference was found between the group with rejection and
without rejection with respect to age at transplantation,
weight, height, gender, and race/ethnicity (p40.05). all of
the snps genotyped were in the hardy–weinberg equilibrium
(p40.05 observed vs predicted).
two novel non-synonymous variants, asp301asn and
gly519arg, were identified in exons 10 and 15 of  xxxg1186xxx .
the effects of these polymorphisms were determined on
impdh production (see supplementary material, table s4
and figures s3 and s4), and neither was found to change
impdh activity or binding.
biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in 15% of patients
in the first postoperative year, which approximates the rate of
rejection observed currently in transplant centers in the
united states with a high percentage of high-risk patients.25

mpa,  xxxd2678xxx . data were represented as mean+sd.

two snps, rs2278293 and rs2278294, were significantly
associated with the incidence of biopsy-proven acute
rejection in the first year post-transplantation (table 3,
po0.05, w2). the prognostic value of each of these snps in
predicting biopsy-proven rejection exceeded 50% for both
the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value
(table 4). both of these snps are intronic, and one is a
component of a haplotype block. the odds ratio by logistic
regression analysis was 0.34 for snp rs2278293 (95%
confidence interval: 0.15–0.76; p ¼ 0.008) and 0.40 for
rs2278294 (95% confidence interval: 0.18–0.89; p ¼ 0.02).
leukopenia occurred in approximately 32% of the
patients receiving mpa in the first postoperative year
(table 3). in previous reports of leukopenia in mpa-treated
transplant patients, leukopenia occurs in 25.9–39.3% of
patients, depending on the criteria for classifying leukopenia.26 leukopenia was not associated with any of the
 xxxg1186xxx  snps. we observed leukopenia in the one variant
 xxxg1187xxx  l263f patient in accordance with our previous
observations.27
six tagging snps were selected to present the two
haplotype blocks in  xxxg1186xxx  (table 1 and figure 1). two
haplotypes, rs11770116–rs2288548 and rs2278294–rs2228075,
were also examined for their influence on leukopenia or acute
rejection within 1-year post-transplantation (figure 1). no
haplotype association was found for leukopenia or acute
rejection.
the genotype distribution for all of the snps, with one
exception, was not statistically different between the hispanic
and non-hispanic patients (table s2). the distribution was
significantly different for rs2288553, but this snp was not
significantly associated with either acute rejection or
leukopenia (table s3).

discussion

numerous snps have now been associated with acute
rejection after renal transplantation. most of these snps
have been part of the transplant immune response and
include cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and
growth factors. the pharmacogenetic factors affecting drug
bioavailability, direct action, and disposition in organ
transplant patients have not been associated with acute
rejection previously, with the exception of an  xxxg10xxx 
polymorphism.28
plasma concentrations of mpa are affected by a number of
gene polymorphisms. both the glucuronidating uridine 50 diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) enzymes29–31 and
the drug transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein-2
( xxxg15xxx )32 polymorphisms may affect mpa plasma concentrations. p-glycoprotein,  xxxg15xxx , and the organic aniontransporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ) transporters may play
a potential role in mpa disposition, so it is not surprising
that considerable variability in mpa pharmacokinetics has
been observed in transplant patients.33 figure 2 shows that
the critical step in exerting the effect of mpa is at impdh,
which is controlled by  xxxg1186xxx  and  xxxg1187xxx .
our previous explorative study showed that  xxxg1187xxx  is
more conserved than its isoform  xxxg1186xxx . although we
identified a novel variant l263f that affects enzyme activity
in  xxxg1187xxx ,27 its rare frequency precludes it from having a
large effect in a small patient population. another snp,
rs11706052, was not associated with the incidence of biopsyproven rejection in this study. owing to the low frequency of
the l263f variant, further studies in larger populations
would be needed to define its impact on clinical outcome.
the impdh monomer contains eight-stranded a/b
barrels, which are the core domain of the  xxxg1186xxx  protein.

for approximately 2% of families with autosomal-dominant
retinitis pigmentosa, and de novo  xxxg1186xxx  mutations are also
rare causes of isolated leber congenital amaurosis.35 two
 xxxg1186xxx  variants, arg105trp and asn198lys, were reported
in two patients with isolated leber congenital amaurosis. the
asp226asn mutation is associated with a severe early-onset
form of retinal degeneration. retinitis pigmentosa is a rare
disease, and we did not observe these variations in our
transplant patients. the only previous report relating to
transplant patients was that a 9-bp insertion within the
 xxxg1186xxx  promoter region was found in a patient exhibiting
severe azathioprine resistance, possibly by reducing the
promoter activity.36
hispanic renal transplant patients are considered to be
high-risk patients and have a higher rate of graft failure based
on united network for organ sharing (unos) data than do
the caucasian renal transplant patients.37 the rates of biopsyproven acute rejection have varied in high-risk renal
transplant populations given antibody-induction therapy
from 15.6%38 to 26.4%39 but are as low as 5% at individual
centers.40 no evidence could be found in this study that the
inclusion of a significant number of hispanic patients
influenced our analysis of  xxxg1186xxx  polymorphisms and
biopsy-proven acute renal transplant rejection.
the accurate assessment of those transplant patients who
are at risk for the development of acute rejection will require
looking at a multiplicity of immune and pharmacologic
factors. in this population of renal transplant patients,
 xxxg1186xxx  snps were prognostic of the development of
biopsy-proven acute rejection in the first postoperative year.
the mechanism of association between  xxxg1186xxx  polymorphisms and acute rejection is still to be determined. one
possible explanation is their linkage to other snps that may
control  xxxg1186xxx  mrna expression, enzyme activity, and
ultimately lymphocyte proliferation. future prospective
studies should examine the mechanism by which  xxxg1186xxx 
polymorphisms might affect the immunologic response in
transplant patients receiving mpa. both pharmacogenomic
and immunogenetic factors will have to be considered in
developing treatment algorithms for transplant patients.41
this study supports the inclusion of  xxxg1186xxx  polymorphisms as one factor that must be tested in developing a panel
of gene polymorphisms used to assess the risk of acute
rejection for transplant patients being treated with mpa.
methods
patient population. in the impdh-sequencing initial study, 30
dna samples of liver transplant patients at the university of
southern california were screened to identify snp candidates in
 xxxg1186xxx . in the following study, we genotyped 191 kidney
transplant patients from the national institute of transplantation
(st vincent’s medical center) in los angeles. all kidney transplant
patients had been treated from the time of transplantation with
tacrolimus, mmf, and prednisone-based immunosuppression, with
the exception of five patients who received cyclosporine in place of
tacrolimus. the therapeutic serum target level was 5–15 mg/ml for
tacrolimus and 100–200 mg/ml for cyclosporine. mmf doses were
adjusted based upon patient’s tolerance of the adverse effects of the
715

articles
drug with respect to gastrointestinal side effects and development of
leukopenia. the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used
for the renal transplant study: (1) patients who underwent renal
transplantation from 2000 to 2005, with available dna, and had
post-transplant survival more than 1 year with follow-up information available; (2) patients must have been on mmf for at least 1
year; and (3) patients must not have been receiving antiviral
(valganciclovir, ganciclovir), anticancer, or other leukopenia-causing
medications at the time when leukopenia was recorded.
the protocols were approved by the institutional review boards
of the university of southern california and st vincent’s medical
center in los angeles. all patients or guardians provided informed
written consent to undergo genotyping. anticoagulated venous
blood was obtained from each patient, and dna was extracted from
whole blood using a commercially available dna extraction
procedure (qiagen, valencia, ca). sequencing and genotyping were
performed in patients who had been previously transplanted, and all
patient information was collected retrospectively. patients were
managed according to the standard transplant center protocol,
which did not include monitoring of mpa plasma concentrations.
at most transplant centers, mpa doses are adjusted based upon
patient’s tolerance of the adverse effects of the drug with respect to
gastrointestinal side effects and the development of leukopenia.

identification in the  xxxg1186xxx  gene was
performed by pcr amplification followed by bidirectional direct
dna sequencing, as described previously.27 pcr was carried out in
a total volume of 50 ml using 50 ng of genomic dna, 5 pmol of each
forward and reverse primer (sigma, st louis, mo), 0.2 mm dntp
(promega, madison, wi), 1  pcr buffer, and 1.5 u of thermostable taq dna polymerase and tgo dna polymerase with
proofreading activity and high fidelity (expand 20 kbplus pcr
system; roche applied science, penzberg, germany). the primers
used are described in table s1. the pcr process included initial
denaturation at 921c for 2 min and 10 cycles of denaturation at
921c for 10 s, annealing at 571c for 30 s, and synthesis at 681c for
7 min followed by additional 25 cycles of denaturation at 921c for
10 s, annealing at 571c for 30 s, and synthesis at 681c for 7 min, with
the time extended by 10 s for each successive cycle. the final
elongation was carried out for 5 min at 721c. amplified pcr
products were purified by using the qiagen pcr purification kit
(qiagen) and sequenced by conventional means using the bigdye
terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit on abi 377 xl
sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). snps were
identified by transferring the chromatograms to sequence assembly
software sequencher 4.1.4 (gene codes, ann arbor, mi). each base
call was compared with the consensus sequence, and the snps were
confirmed by visual inspection of the chromatograms.
for genotyping the snps identified, we genotyped 191 transplant
patients by taqman assay using the abi 7900 real-time pcr
system (applied biosystems). two oligonucleotide probes for each
snp were synthesized by applied biosystems. dna concentration
was measured photometrically and the dna was diluted to a
concentration of 2 ng/ml. amplification was performed in a final
volume of 25 ml dna solution at a concentration of 2 ng/ml,
100 pmol/ml of each probe, 2.5 ml of taqman universal pcr master
mix (applied biosystems), and distilled water. in every assay,
controls for the wild type and mutations were included. reaction
mixtures were loaded into 96-well plates and placed in an abi prism
sequence detector 7900 (applied biosystems). the pcr conditions
were as follows: initial denaturation at 951c for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of denaturation (941c for 15 s), annealing, and extension
in one step (601c for 60 s).
a representative chromatogram of the (a) g519r and (b) d301n
heterozygotes for the  xxxg1186xxx  gene is shown in figure s1. the
arrows indicate that the variant is c/t and a/g in the sense sequence
(a, adenine; g, guanine; c, cytosine; and t, thymine).

statistical analysis. allele and genotype frequencies were calculated
for each locus and tested for hardy–weinberg equilibrium using
arlequin version 3 (http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3).
determination of linkage disequilibrium (ld), tagging snps,
haplotype blocks, and frequencies were performed by using
haploview version 3.2. haplotype blocks were defined according
to the ‘‘solid spine of ld’’ setting in haploview 3.2 software, which is
under the analysis criteria solid spine of ld40.8.
each variant in  xxxg1186xxx  underwent univariate analysis for the
difference of allele distribution between patients with or without
leukopenia and between patients with or without rejection within
1-year post-transplantation by w2 test. considering the low
frequency of the minor alleles, we combined the homozygous
variant with the heterozygous patients. therefore, the presence or
absence of the variant alleles, instead of genotype, was compared in
this population. multiple logistic regression analysis was performed
to examine the association between  xxxg1186xxx  variants and acute
rejection in patients. for snps with p-value o0.05, clinical
prognostic values (sensitivities, specificities, negative and positive
predictive values) were assessed for their association with acute
rejections occurring in the first postoperative year. all p-values
o0.05 were considered as significant. statistical analysis was
performed using the spss software program version 14.0 for
windows (spss, chicago, il).
the incidence of both leukopenia and rejection was treated as a
dichotomous trait. patients with a white blood cell count 43,000/ml
were considered as not having leukopenia, and patients with a white
blood cell p3,000/ml during mpa treatment were considered as
having leukopenia. further subgroup analysis was carried out using
the grades of leukopenia described by the southwest oncology
group (swog).42
