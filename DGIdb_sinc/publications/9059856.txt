1. introduction
during the last two trimesters of gestation the human
placenta is an organ that occupies a unique physiological
position, and is able to play an important endocrine role.
this organ synthesizes a large variety of hormones, such
as progesterone, estradiol and estriol from precursors obtained from the mother or fetus which are secreted in both

maternal and fetal blood compartments žbourget et al.,
1995..
the human syncytiotrophoblast is known to serve several roles in pregnancy. it mediates the transport of nutrients, exchange of minerals and immunoglobulins from the
maternal to fetal circulation. this polarized epithelium has
a cell layer with a microvillous apical plasma membrane
žbrush-border. facing maternal blood, containing filamentous internal actin structure and rich in alkaline phosphatase activity, and a smooth basal membrane facing fetal
circulation rich in adenylate cyclase and naq,kq-atpase
activities.

although it has been demonstrated that human placenta
is able to synthesize and secrete acetylcholine žsastry et
al., 1976; olubadewo and sastry, 1977., the function of
this neurotransmitter in a non-innervated organ has not yet
been clearly defined. it has been suggested that acetylcholine could regulate placental amino-acid transport
žrowell and sastry, 1980; yudilevich and sweiry, 1985.,
blood flow žboura et al., 1986., the release of placental
hormones, such as chorionic somatomamotrophin, andror
regulate prostaglandin output from placental tissue žking
et al., 1991.. however, the existence of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human placental tissues has not been
clearly demonstrated. the first report on the existence of
muscarinic receptors in human placenta žfant and harbison, 1977. was not confirmed in further studies by other
authors žwelsch and wennerberg, 1978., and no additional
evidence on this field has been produced since then.
in order to clarify these controversial observations, the
aim of this study was focused on investigating the presence and distribution of muscarinic receptors in brushborder and basal plasma syncytiotrophoblast membranes
from human term placenta.

2. material and methods
2.1. membrane preparation
human term placentas were obtained within 30 min
after normal delivery and placed on ice-cold 0.9% nacl.
all the procedures were carried out at 48c. the umbilical
cord, amnion, chorion and fibrous membranes were removed and the syncytiotrophoblastic tissue was cut into
small pieces with scissors. brush-border membranes were
prepared using a homogenization and mg 2q precipitation
technique žglacier et al., 1988. and basal plasma membranes were obtained according to a method described
previously žkelley et al., 1983.. both syncytiotrophoblast
basal plasma and brush-border membrane preparations were
resuspended in 5 mm hepesrtris, ph 7.4, containing
proteinase inhibitors ž1 mgrml leupeptin, 1 mgrml aprotinin, 0.1 mgrml bacitracin and 0.1 mgrml phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride. and were frozen at y808c
until use for muscarinic receptor binding assay. the purity
of preparations was assessed by measuring the enrichment
of the brush-border membrane enzyme alkaline phosphatase žlansing et al., 1967. and the basal plasma membrane marker, w 3 hxdihydroalprenolol binding žkelley et al.,
1983., as compared with the homogenate.
2.2. drugs and ligands
w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine žspecific activity 80–84
cirmmol. was purchased from amersham žamersham,

uk.. hepes, tris and other chemicals were purchased
from sigma žst. louis, mo, usa.. 4-diphenylacetoxy-nmethylpiperidine methiodide ž4-damp., dicyclomine and
hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  žhhsd. were from research
biomedicals international žnatick, ma, usa.. atropine
sulphate was a generous gift from b. braun medical
žbarcelona, spain..  xxxd2965xxx  dihydrochloride and
ž11ž2-diethyl-amino.methyl.-1-piperidinylacetyl-5-11-dihydro-6 h-pyridož14.benzodiazepine žaf-dx 116. were generous gifts from dr. karl thomae žbiberach, germany..
himbacine was a generous gift from dr. w.c. taylor
žsydney, australia..
2.3. binding assays
membranes were resuspended in 20 mm hepes buffer,
ph 7.4, containing 50 mm nacl and 10 mm mgcl 2 , to
achieve the final protein concentration of approximately
300 mgrml ž296 " 15. for brush-border membranes and
140 mgrml ž140 " 12. for basal plasma membranes. samples were incubated for 45 min at 308c in the presence of
the radioligand žw 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine. in a final volume of 1 ml, in the absence or presence of 10 mm atropine
to define the specific binding. binding reactions were
stopped by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 20 mm tris
buffer, ph 7.4, and then bound and free ligands were
separated by rapid filtration under vacuum through whatman gfrb glass filters, presoaked with 0.1% polyethylenimine for 1 h before filtration using a brandel filtration
manifold. the filters were washed three times with 4 ml of
ice-cold distilled water, and placed in vials containing 4 ml
of scintillation liquid žformula 989 liquid scintillation
cocktail, dupont nen, wilmington, de, usa.. the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting
žwallac 1410. with 50% counting efficiency. saturation
experiments were carried out with eight concentrations of
w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine, ranging from 0.05 = 10y9 m
to 2 = 10y9 m. inhibition studies of the binding of 2 =
10y9 m w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine with the muscarinic
receptor antagonists  xxxd2965xxx , af-dx 116, himbacine,
4-damp, dicyclomine and hhsd were carried out with
22 concentrations of these drugs, ranging from 6 = 10y1 0
m to 8 = 10y5 m.
protein was measured by the method of lowry et al.
ž1951. using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
2.4. data analysis
all binding data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting
procedure using the ligand program modified by mcpearson ž1985.. in saturation experiments, the statistical
analysis was performed by the analysis of covariance test;
statistical significance was set at p - 0.05. all data represent the mean " s.e.m. from three to five experiments
performed in triplicate.

3. results
3.1. membrane purity
in order to obtain a correct interpretation of the binding
data, the purity of the membrane preparation was previously analyzed. alkaline phosphatase activity in syncytiotrophoblast brush-border membranes was on average
enriched 18-fold compared to the homogenate žhomogenate: 1.1 " 0.2; brush-border membranes: 20.4 " 4.8;
basal plasma membranes: 2.1 " 0.9 mmolrmin per mg
protein., while w 3 hxdihydroalprenolol binding in basal
plasma membranes was more than 30-fold greater than the
binding in the homogenate žhomogenate: 90.5 " 8.1;
brush-border membranes: 87.4 " 7.2; basal plasma membranes: 2843.1 " 313.8 fmolrmg protein..
3.2. binding assays
to perform a pharmacological characterization of the
muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human placental syncytiotrophoblast brush-border and basal plasma membranes,
saturation and competition binding experiments were carried out. specific w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine binding
reached the equilibrium at 20 min of incubation at 308c
and was stable for up to 90 min ždata not shown.. the
results obtained in saturation experiments with w 3 hx nmethyl-scopolamine to placental membranes žtable 1. revealed the existence of a single population of muscarinic
receptors in both brush-border and basal plasma membrane
preparations žfig. 1. with similar affinities ž k d 0.28 " 0.04

experiments with the above antagonists the hill coefficients were close to 1, suggesting the existence of a
homogeneous population of binding sites in both brushborder and basal plasma membranes. moreover, in all the
experiments performed, the best fit was to the one-site
model. all these data, taken together, suggest that the
muscarinic receptors expressed in syncytiotrophoblast
brush-border and basal plasma membranes from human
term placenta belong to different subtypes.

4. discussion
human placenta express a variety of different receptors,
among them endothelin žmcqueen et al., 1993., dopamine
d 2 and 5-ht2 žvaillancourt et al., 1994., epidermal growth
factor žduello et al., 1994., estrogen and progesterone
žpatricio, 1994., calcitonin žlafond et al., 1994.,  xxxg99xxx  žjimenez
´ et al., 1996. and a- and b-adrenocepž
tors falkay et al., 1994.. furthermore, several mrna
encoding for different receptors have been found in human
placenta, such as human k-opioid receptor žmansson et al.,
1994. and histamine h 1 receptor žfukui et al., 1994..
however, contradictory data on the existence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in this tissue exist. whereas
some authors have suggested the presence of binding sites
for muscarinic ligands žfant and harbison, 1977., this
finding has not been confirmed by other authors žwelsch
and wennerberg, 1978..
based on the existence of  xxxg440xxx  and
acetylcholine in human placenta, we have investigated the
presence of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in syncy-

tiotrophoblast brush-border and basal plasma membranes
from human term placenta.
the results of the present study indicate the presence of
specific and saturable binding sites for w 3 hx n-methylscopolamine in both brush-border and basal plasma membranes from human term placenta that label a single population of muscarinic receptors. the dissociation constant
ž k d . for the tracer as determined by saturation experiments was in agreement with previously reported data
obtained in several tissue preparations žwaelbroeck et al.,
1990; lazareno et al., 1990; pavıa
´ et al., 1991. and in
transfected cell lines expressing different muscarinic receptor subtypes ždorje
¨ et al., 1991.. the number of binding
sites per mg of protein which can be labeled by the tracer
in basal plasma membranes was comparable to that reported for human submandibular gland žmartos et al.,
1985., and was greater than in brush-border membranes.
these findings unequivocally show the existence of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human term placenta.
at present, at least three pharmacologically different
muscarinic receptor subtypes have been defined: m 1
acetylcholine receptors which have high affinity for  xxxd2965xxx , and are preferentially localized in nervous tissue;
m 2 acetylcholine receptors which have a high affinity for
af-dx 116, and are preferentially localized in cardiac
tissue, and m 3 acetylcholine receptors which have a high
affinity for both hhsd and 4-damp, and are localized
preferentially in glandular tissue žhulme et al., 1990.. a
fourth subtype žm 4 . has been suggested in rabbit lung,
chicken heart and ng108-15 cells žlazareno et al., 1990..
moreover, five different molecular subtypes have now
been delineated: m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , m 4 and m 5 . there seems to
be a general agreement that the molecular subtypes m 1 , m 2
and m 3 represent the pharmacological muscarinic m 1 , m 2
and m 3 receptor subtypes, respectively žgoyal, 1989..
in order to pharmacologically characterize the above
described binding sites, several antagonists competing with
w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine were used in this work. the
inhibition constant ž k i . values obtained in brush-border
membrane preparation with  xxxd2965xxx , a selective muscarinic m 1 receptor antagonist, were closer to the values
found for the muscarinic m 1 than for the m 3 receptor
subtype in mammalian tissues žhulme et al., 1990;
delmedo et al., 1989. and than for the muscarinic m 3 or
m 4 receptor subtypes when expressed in transfected cell
lines žbuckley et al., 1989; dorje
¨ et al., 1991.. these
results, in terms of high affinity for  xxxd2965xxx , were in
agreement with those obtained when using af-dx 116, a
selective muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist, as the competing drug which showed low affinity for the receptors
found in brush-border membranes. the k i values for this
antagonist were similar to those found in transfected cell
lines expressing the muscarinic m 1 receptor subtype
žbuckley et al., 1989.. these findings strongly suggest that
the receptor in brush-border membranes belongs to the
muscarinic m 1 receptor subtype.

j. paõıa
´ et al.r european journal of pharmacology 320 (1997) 209–214

interestingly,  xxxd2965xxx  showed low affinity for the
muscarinic receptor subtype present in basal plasma membranes. this affinity was similar to that found in rat heart,
a tissue that mainly expresses the muscarinic m 2 receptor
subtype ždelmedo et al., 1989; lazareno et al., 1990., and
closer to the muscarinic m 2 than to the m 4 receptor
subtype when expressed in transfected cell lines ždorje
¨ et
al., 1991.. again, the behavior of the antagonist af-dx
116 was the opposite, showing high affinity for the muscarinic receptor subtype in basal plasma membranes. the
k i values in this preparation were similar to the values
found for the muscarinic m 2 receptor subtype expressed in
rat heart ždelmedo et al., 1989. and in transfected cell
lines expressing the muscarinic m 2 receptor subtype
žbuckley et al., 1989.. these findings strongly suggest that
the receptor in basal plasma membranes belong to the
muscarinic m 2 receptor subtype.
as we started to perform the competition experiments
using the two antagonists with the highest selectivity
žpirenzepine – m 1 , af-dx 116 – m 2 ., and based on the
k i values found, it was highly tempting to think that the
receptors found in brush-border and basal plasma membranes correspond to the muscarinic m 1 and m 2 receptor
subtypes respectively. in order to confirm this possibility
and to establish a difference between muscarinic m 1-m 3
and m 2-m 4 receptor subtypes, further competition experiments using the muscarinic receptor antagonists hhsd,
4-damp, himbacine and dicyclomine were carried out.
regarding brush-border membranes from human placenta, hhsd showed k i values closer to the muscarinic
m 1 than to the m 3 receptor subtype expressed in transfected cell lines žbuckley et al., 1989.. moreover, k i
values for 4-damp in the same membranes were closer to
the muscarinic m 1 than to the m 3 receptor subtype
žlazareno et al., 1990., whereas both himbacine and dicyclomine showed k i values similar to the values found in
transfected cell lines expressing the muscarinic m 1 receptor subtype ždorje
¨ et al., 1991.. when the same experiments were performed in basal plasma membranes from
human placenta, himbacine showed k i values closer to
the muscarinic m 2 than to the m 1 receptor subtype ždorje
¨
et al., 1991., while the k i values for dicyclomine were
closer to the values for the muscarinic m 2 than for the m 4
receptor subtype expressed in rat heart and rabbit lung,
respectively žlazareno et al., 1990.. hhsd and 4-damp
showed k i values similar to those found for the muscarinic m 2 receptor subtype when expressed in transfected
cell lines ždorje
¨ et al., 1991. or rat heart žlazareno et al.,
.
1990 .
competition experiments show therefore clear differences in terms of affinities between brush-border and basal
plasma membranes from syncytiotrophoblast, supporting
the idea that the receptors found in brush-border and basal
plasma membranes can be preliminarily classified as the
muscarinic m 1 and m 2 receptor subtypes respectively.
interestingly, the muscarinic m 2 receptor subtype was

213

expressed in 4-fold higher number than the muscarinic m 1
receptor subtype in human term placenta. our observations
demonstrating a polar distribution of different subtypes of
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human syncytiotrophoblast tissues are in agreement with our previous findings for  xxxg99xxx  receptors žjimenez
et al., 1996..
´
in summary, the major findings of this study are as
follows. firstly, specific w 3 hx n-methyl-scopolamine binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors has been for the
first time clearly identified in syncytiotrophoblast brushborder and basal plasma membranes from human term
placenta. secondly, the muscarinic receptors in syncytiotrophoblast brush-border and basal plasma membranes
from human term placenta showed a different pattern in
terms of the number of receptors expressed. thirdly, a
preliminary muscarinic receptor subtype classification in
this tissue has been performed, showing that the receptors
in brush-border and basal plasma placenta membranes
belong respectively to the muscarinic m 1 and m 2 receptor
subtypes.
the functional significance of these findings in terms of
the number of receptors and distribution of different subtypes in this tissue is as yet unknown, but these receptors
probably mediate different functions as they belong to
different subtypes and are coupled to different second
messengers. several possibilities have been proposed for
the effect of placental acetylcholine, such as a role in the
control of amino-acid transport, in the regulation of placental blood flow, an effect on the release of placental hormones, andror an involvement in the mechanism of human parturition žking et al., 1991..
