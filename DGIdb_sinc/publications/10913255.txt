abstract: general anesthetics have been reported to alter the functions of  xxxg85xxx 
(gpcr) signaling systems. to determine whether these effects might be mediated by direct binding
interactions with the gpcr or its associated g protein, we studied the binding character of halothane on
mammalian rhodopsin, structurally the best understood gpcr, by using direct photoaffinity labeling with
[14c]halothane. in the bleached bovine rod disk membranes (rdm), opsin and membrane lipids were
dominantly photolabeled with [14c]halothane, but none of the three g protein subunits were labeled. in
opsin itself, halothane labeling was inhibited by unlabeled halothane with an ic50 of 0.9 mm and a hill
coefficient of -0.8. the stoichiometry was 1.1:1.0 (halothane:opsin molar ratio). the ic50 values of
isoflurane and 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane were 5.0 and 15 mm, respectively. ethanol had no
effect on opsin labeling by halothane. a nonimmobilizer, 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane, inhibited
halothane labeling by 50% at 0.05 mm. the present results demonstrate that halothane binds specifically
and selectively to gpcrs in the rdm. the absence of halothane binding to any of the g protein subunits
strongly suggests that the functional effects of halothane on gpcr signaling systems are mediated by
direct interactions with receptor proteins.

general anesthetics have been considered to act on
neuronal membranes, and exert their effects on synaptic
transmission (1). neuronal membrane proteins, including a
variety of receptors and channels, are responsible for
information transfer across the synaptic membranes, and have
therefore attracted attention as potentially relevant anesthetic
targets. the activity of many neuronal membrane proteins,
such as the ligand-gated ion channels, has been demonstrated
to be sensitive to anesthetics (1), but the molecular interactions underlying the changes in activity are poorly understood. indeed, it remains unclear whether anesthetics exert
their effect through direct binding interactions with the
protein, or whether they simply alter important properties
of membrane lipids.
g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) are neuronal membrane proteins that recognize and transmit signals from
diverse ligands to a variety of g proteins, which in turn
amplify and sustain the duration of the signals (2). not only
in brain function, but also in hormonal control of cardiovascular system and metabolism, gpcrs and g proteins are
essential signaling intermediaries. the extensive list of
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that work through
gpcrs includes acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine,

adenosine, and opioids (3). the functional significance of
the effects of volatile anesthetics on these gpcrs has been
shown in several different in vitro systems. halothane
inhibited m1 muscarinic (4) as well as thromboxane a2
receptor signaling in xenopus oocytes (5). halothane was
also shown to reduce the agonist binding affinity of the
beta-adrenergic receptor in rat myocardium (6). these data
agree that the site of halothane action is most likely the
receptor and/or its associated g protein, but not intracellular
signaling systems. in addition, these data suggest that widely
distributed gpcr signaling systems might be targets that
contribute to anesthetic action. however, direct binding of
any volatile anesthetic to gpcrs or g protein has not yet
been demonstrated.
mammalian rhodopsin is a member of the 7-helix gpcr
family. structure-function relationships in rhodopsin have
been extensively studied in order to understand the molecular
mechanisms of signal transduction by gpcrs in general (2,
3). although rhodopsin is a photoreceptor and we are not
proposing rhodopsin itself as an important anesthetic target,
rhodopsin is considered a reasonable model of the gpcrs
of perhaps greater relevance to anesthesia for the following
reasons: (1) the primary to tertiary structural features of
the rhodopsin family of gpcrs, which includes many
neurotransmitter receptors discussed above, are highly
conserved (3). (2) ligand binding sites in the transmembrane
core in these gpcrs are similar, particularly the sites for
biogenic amines and rhodopsin ligand retinal (2, 7, 8). (3)
g protein binding domains are highly homologous (7). (4)
transducin (gt), the g protein associated with rhodopsin, is
most similar to gi. gt r subunit has approximately 70%

amino acid homology to gi (9). in addition to these
substantial similarities, functional effects of volatile anesthetics on rhodopsin have been demonstrated in both in vivo
(10) and in vitro systems (11, 12). finally, among these
gpcrs, rhodopsin is the only one that can be obtained in
high mass and purity in native biological membranes (13),
an important practical consideration when attempting to relate
weak binding to a single molecular target. therefore,
confirming and characterizing binding of halothane to
rhodopsin in the retinal membranes could give us significant
insight into the molecular interactions of anesthetics with
gpcrs.
methods
materials. fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local
slaughterhouse (mopac, inc., soudertown, pa), and the
retinas were dissected in room light. rod disk membranes
(rdm)1 were prepared by sucrose flotation in isotonic buffer
(20 mm mops, 100 mm kcl, 6 mm mgcl2, 1 mm
dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm edta, ph 7) as previously
described (14). the membranes were stored in the same
medium on ice at a rhodopsin concentration of 200-300 µm
under argon. absorption spectra of the rdm measured
before experiments showed no specific peak for rhodopsin
conformers. [14c]halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-[1-14c]trifluoroethane) (specific activity 51 mci/mmol) was purchased from dupont, nen (boston, ma). labeled halothane
was further purified by hplc on a c4 column (supelcosil,
lc-304, supelco, bellefonte, pa) using a solvent system
of h2o-methanol (4:1). all final photolabeling solutions
contained less than 0.5 m methanol. we thus tested photoaffinity labeling of [14c]halothane to rdm with increasing
concentrations of methanol, 30 mm-3.0 m. methanol did
not show significant displacement of halothane labeling up
to the concentration of 1.0 m. unlabeled halothane was
obtained from halocarbon laboratories (hackensack, nj).
the thymol preservative was removed before use with an
aluminum oxide column. isoflurane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) was purchased from ohmeda
ppd, inc. (liberty corner, nj). 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (f3) and 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (f6)
were obtained from pcr incorporated (gainesville, fl). all
other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
photoaffinity labeling of halothane to retinal membranes. rdm were incubated with [14c]halothane in isotonic
mops buffer in 2 ml quartz cuvettes (5 mm path length)
at room temperature in the light and were exposed to 254
nm light (hg pencil calibration lamp; oriel, stanford, ct)
at a distance of ∼5 mm for 60 s with continuous stirring.
the final concentrations in the photolabeling solution were
opsin 25 µm and [14c]halothane 16 µm. the photolabeled
rdm were centrifuged and washed twice with isotonic
mops buffer. g proteins were then removed from labeled
retinal membranes by washing 3 times with 100 µm gtp
in hypotonic buffer (10 mm mops, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm

(15). supernatant was collected and microconcentrated using
10 kda molecular weight cutoff membranes (microcon10,
amicon inc., beverly, ma). sds/page of the labeled
membranes and isolated g proteins was performed in
modified laemmli gels [acrylamide 15%, bisacrylamide
0.03%, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 380 mm, and sds
0.1%], and followed by autoradiography of the dried gel.
protection from [14c]halothane labeling by unlabeled
halothane. rdm were incubated with [14c]halothane and
with increasing concentrations of unlabeled halothane in
potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm kh2po4, 2 mm mgcl2,
100 mm kcl, ph 7) in 2 ml quartz cuvettes at room
temperature in the light and were exposed to 254 nm light
as described above. the final concentrations in the photolabeling solution were opsin 3.1 µm, [14c]halothane 3.4 (
0.7 µm, and unlabeled halothane 0-6.0 mm. one milliliter
of the cuvette contents was vacuum-filtered through glass
microfiber filters (gf/b, whatman international ltd., england) and washed with 15 ml of ice-cold saline. retained
label on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation, which
we defined as label incorporation in the rdm. sds/page
of the remaining labeled membranes was performed in the
modified laemmli gels, and the gel was stained with
coomassie blue. the relative mass of opsin in the bands on
sds/page was determined by reflective density using an
imaging densitometer (gs-710, bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca). rhodopsin bands in the dried gels were excised
and dissolved by incubating with 30%  xxxd2298xxx 
at 60 °c for 5 h. label incorporation into opsin itself was
determined in the dissolved gel slices by scintillation
counting, and disintegrations per minute (dpm) were normalized to the relative mass of opsin. we defined this dpm as
label incorporation in opsin.
protection from [14c]halothane labeling by other anesthetics and a nonimmobilizer. photoaffinity labeling of
[14c]halothane to the rdm was evaluated in the presence
of isoflurane, f3, f6, and ethanol at the concentrations given
in the figures. isoflurane, f3, and f6 were prepared in
potassium phosphate buffer, and allowed to equilibrate for
several hours after vigorous vortexing and sonication.
photoaffinity labeling and sds/page were performed
following the protocol described above.
quantitation and statistics. the data of the halothane
protection study were fitted to sigmoid dose-response curves
with variable slopes using nonlinear least-squares regression.
the ic50 value is the concentration of the compound required
to inhibit half of the inhibitable [14c]halothane labeling. the
bottom of the protection curve was forced to zero for f6
and ethanol in rdm, and halothane and f3 in opsin, because
the initial fitted values were negative.

from the top are ovalbumin (43.0 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29.0
kda), beta-lactoglobulin (18.4 kda), lysozyme (14.3 kda), and bovine

bands in lane 1 from the top are phosphodiesterase (pde), rhodopsin
(opsin) dimer (rh-d), and rhodopsin (opsin) monomer (rh). the
two small bands immediately above the rhodopsin monomer are g
protein beta and r subunits. the resulting autoradiogram (lane 2)
shows dominant incorporation into opsin and lipids (below the 6.2
kda standard). in lane 3, the prominent bands from the top are
phosphodiesterase (pde), g protein  xxxg217xxx  ( xxxg2225xxx ), r subunit (gr),
and  xxxg218xxx  (ggamma). the weak band immediately below the r
subunit is rhodopsin. there is no appreciable label incorporation
in g protein subunits in the autoradiogram (lane 4).

containing 3.1 nmol of opsin. incorporation of [14c]halothane
into the rdm was significantly inhibited in the presence of
f6, f3, isoflurane, and ethanol. f3, isoflurane, and ethanol
inhibited halothane labeling at higher concentrations with
ic50 values of 5.1 mm, 8.1 mm, and 5.2 m, respectively
(table 1). f6, a nonimmobilizer, displaced halothane binding
by 50% at a concentration of 0.17 mm.
figure 3 illustrates protection from halothane photolabeling
in opsin itself (from excised, dissolved gel bands). label
incorporation to opsin in sds/page is presented as dpm
normalized to the relative mass of opsin in the bands using
reflective density. incorporation of [14c]halothane into opsin
was significantly inhibited by unlabeled halothane with an
ic50 value of 0.9 mm and a hill coefficient of -0.8. at the
ic50 of halothane, 0.53 ( 0.01 nmol of halothane was
incorporated into opsin 1.00 ( 0.03 nmol (mean ( sem, n
) 7). ic50 values of isoflurane and f3 were 5.0 and 15 mm,
respectively (table 1). incorporation of [14c]halothane into
opsin was not inhibited by ethanol. f6 inhibited halothane
photolabeling in opsin with an ic50 of 0.05 mm. to
determine stoichiometry, we used label incorporated in the
rhodopsin band in sds/page. stoichiometry based on
halothane incorporation at ic50 is 0.53 ( 0.02 (halothane:
opsin molar ratio). the maximum stoichiometry is thus 1.1
(halothane/opsin).
figure 4 shows a gradual decrease in label incorporation
in opsin in the sds/page autoradiogram with increasing
concentrations of unlabeled halothane. the relative mass of
opsin in the sds/page decreased at high concentrations of
halothane, indicating the predictable aggregation/crosslinking of opsin by ultraviolet light (uv).

in the lipids. the autoradiogram showed that label incorporation into any of the g protein subunits was not appreciable.
this result was confirmed by scintillation counting of the
dissolved gel slices of the g  xxxg2255xxx , beta, and gamma subunits.
because of the possibility that halothane binds to receptorunbound g proteins, we studied photoaffinity labeling of
[14c]halothane to purified g proteins in the same condition
as described above. label incorporation into the purified g
proteins was at least 10-fold lower than that in rhodopsin.

isoflurane, f3, f6, and ethanol. figure 2 illustrates protection from halothane photolabeling in the rdm by anesthetics
and a nonimmobilizer. with increasing concentrations of
unlabeled halothane, 85% of the [14c]halothane labeling was
inhibitable with an ic50 of 0.9 mm and a hill coefficient of
-0.8. at the ic50 of halothane, 5.2 ( 1.3 nmol of halothane
(mean ( sem, n ) 7) was incorporated into the rdm

stoichiometry for halothane in rhodopsin. the present
results demonstrate preferential binding of halothane to
gpcrs in bovine retinal membranes in the low millimolar
concentration range. halothane was incorporated into opsin
with the calculated stoichiometry of 1.1:1 (halothane:
rhodopsin), probably indicating only a single specific binding
site for halothane in this 40 kda receptor. for comparison,
the  xxxg456xxx  (290 kda) in torpedo
membranes was photolabeled with [14c]halothane with at
least a 5:1 halothane:receptor molar ratio (16). skeletal muscle ca2+-atpase (110 kda) was also labeled with a 5:1 stoichiometry, a value we recalculated based on the published
data (17). thus, the stoichiometry of halothane labeling in
these membrane proteins is not a simple feature of molecular
mass, but appears to rely on the different tertiary and quaternary structures of these proteins. this finding is also consistent with our previous finding in soluble proteins that specific
halothane binding is a feature of the tertiary structure of the
proteins (18, 19). in addition, binding stoichiometry may be
dependent on more subtle conformational shifts. rhodopsin
is known to undergo a series of light-induced conformational
changes, during which helix orientation as well as receptor
volume are reported to change (2). potential anesthetic
binding sites, such as the hydrophobic core or a lipid-protein
interface, might also change during the cycle. the present
experiments were performed only on bleached rhodopsin,
opsin, in the rdm, which is the receptor protein without
bound ligand. therefore, further work will be required to
isolate and label the various rhodopsin conformers.

concentrations are shown under the autoradiogram. the relative
mass of opsin in the sds/page significantly decreased to 80 (

respectively, compared to the opsin without unlabeled halothane.

specificity and selectivity of halothane binding in rhodopsin. considerable differences in the ability to inhibit halothane labeling between the other anesthetics strongly
suggest that binding sites for different anesthetics are distinct.
in addition, the binding sites for halothane in opsin appear
to be fairly specific. the ic50 of halothane in opsin was 0.9
mm, only 2-fold higher than the immobilization ec50 value
previously reported in rats (20) and 4-fold higher than the
analogous ec50 value in tadpoles (21). on the other hand,

the ic50 of isoflurane was at least 10-fold higher than its
ec50 values (20, 22), and ethanol did not provide significant
protection from halothane photolabeling in opsin. the
potencies of these anesthetics and the nonimmobilizer, except
ethanol, to inhibit halothane labeling in opsin are similar to
those in the intact rdm, suggesting the specific binding sites
for halothane in the membranes reside in rhodopsin.
in the present study, ethanol was unique among the
anesthetics used. ethanol inhibited halothane labeling in the
rdm only at very high concentrations, but did not affect
halothane labeling in opsin, suggesting the  xxxd102xxx inhibitable
fraction in the rdm is lipid. consistent with this interpretation, ethanol has been shown to interact with specific domains of membrane lipids, and the lipid-protein interface
appears to be one of the sites affected by ethanol (23). it is
thus possible that specific interactions of ethanol with
membrane lipids could displace halothane labeling in the
rdm lipids. in this context, it is of interest that ethanol is
thought to affect some membrane protein functions through
lipid-mediated mechanisms. for example, ethanol enhanced
metarhodopsin ii formation by disordering phospholipid acyl
chain packing in the rdm (24). similarly, another study
showed that the effect of ethanol on protein kinese c (pkc)
activity was dependent on the lipid composition of the
bilayers (25). however, we cannot entirely eliminate the
possibility that ethanol directly interacts with rhodopsin.
direct interactions of ethanol with membrane-associated
proteins have been demonstrated in pkc (25), and saturable
ethanol binding to membranes (26) also suggests interactions
with protein. the present result indicates that, if there is an
ethanol binding site in rhodopsin, it is expected to have little
communication with the halothane binding sites.
a nonimmobilizer, f6, protected opsin from halothane
photolabeling with an ic50 of 0.05 mm, suggesting that f6
shares the binding domain with halothane in opsin. although
nonimmobilizers, or nonanesthetics, do not prevent animals
from moving in response to noxious stimuli at concentrations
predicted to be anesthetic based on lipid-partitioning (27),
f6 has been reported to bind in protein sites where anesthetics do. f6 quenched human  xxxg124xxx  (hsa) fluorescence from its single tryptophan with a dissociation constant
of 160 µm (28), indicating that f6 binds in the same hsa
domain as halothane (29, 30). however, the effects of f6
on global stability and regional dynamics of the soluble
proteins are opposite to anesthetics (31, 32). further, it has
been reported that f6, as well as halothane, f3, and ethanol,
inhibited muscarinic m1 (33) and 5-ht type 2a receptor
induced currents in xenopus oocytes (34). however, a pkc

halothane binding to a  xxxg85xxx 
inhibitor abolished the effects of the anesthetics on both
receptors, but had no effect on f6 actions, suggesting the
inhibitory mechanism of f6 is different from halothane and
does not involve pkc. in addition, a recent report suggested
f6 affects learning and memory (35), in which muscarinic
receptors are considered to play an important role. taken
together, these data suggest that f6 may exhibit a form of
isosteric competition, a commonly accepted mechanism of
many receptor antagonists.
volatile anesthetics and gpcr signaling system. the
present results clearly show the absence of halothane
photolabeling to any of g protein subunits in the rdm. this
suggests that functional effects of halothane on the rhodopsin
signaling system are mediated through direct interactions
with the receptor protein. although the present study was
not designed to address the functional influence of halothane
on rhodopsin, specific binding can be associated with specific
functional changes of protein (36). in fact, volatile anesthetics
and alcohol have been reported to affect conformational
changes in rhodopsin. halothane was shown to reduce the
light-induced proton uptake of rhodopsin in rdm (11),
suggesting that halothane may inhibit the metarhodopsin i
to metarhodopsin ii transition. this effect was also illustrated
by  xxxd1993xxx  (12) and ethanol (24) using absorption spectra.
furthermore, dark adaptation, in which rhodopsin regeneration with retinal from opsin plays an important role, was
retarded in humans under halothane anesthesia (10). these
findings suggest that anesthetics may preferentially bind to
a certain conformer of rhodopsin. considerable conformational dependence of halothane photolabeling has been
demonstrated in soluble protein (36). photoaffinity labeling
on regenerated rhodopsin and its conformers could give us
more insight for functional effects of halothane binding in
gpcrs.
a number of studies have shown that volatile anesthetics
interfere with other gpcr signaling as well. halothane has
been reported to inhibit thromboxane a2 signaling in a
competitive way at the membrane receptor (5, 37). halothane,
however, has no effect on intracellular signaling pathways
in this system, indicating that halothane interacts with the
receptor or receptor-g protein coupling (5). this effect was
also demonstrated in m1 muscarinic receptor signaling (4).
in addition, halothane decreased ligand binding affinity in
opioid receptor from guinea-pig brain (38) and in beta-adrenergic receptor in rat myocardium (6). although these data
clearly show a wide spectrum of anesthetic effects through
gpcr signaling systems, differentiation of possible anesthetic binding sites, such as between the receptor and its
associated g protein, does not appear to be detectable in the
experimental settings used in these studies. therefore, further
identification of anesthetic binding sites in this type of
receptor needs to be done with the use of combined
experimental techniques including photoaffinity labeling.
lipid photolabeling in the rdm. the present study shows
that some of the inhibitable labeling can be attributed to
membrane lipids. in the rdm, approximately 85% of the
halothane labeling was inhibited by unlabeled halothane
(figure 2), which is greater than the total label incorporation
into opsin itself. although volatile anesthetic partitioning into
membrane lipids has long been considered to be nonspecific
and nonsaturable, a recent nmr spectroscopic study shows
xenon interacts saturably and preferentially with the am-

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 29, 2000 8501
phiphilic head region of a model membrane (39). further,
recent molecular dynamics studies show that anesthetic
molecules partition into localized regions within the lipid
bilayers (40). these data indicate anesthetics may interact
specifically with the distinct structural organization of lipid
bilayers, suggesting saturability, and encourage future studies
on preferential localization of halothane in the rdm lipids
for a greater understanding of halothane dynamics in
biological membranes.
halothane and other volatile anesthetics are known to
partition well into the lipid bilayers. the synaptosomal
membrane/buffer partition coefficient for halothane was
reported to be 27.5 (41), and phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol
(2:1) bilayer/buffer partitioning was 50 (42). one could thus
argue that preferential binding of halothane to rhodopsin,
but not to g protein, might be only due to a higher
concentration of halothane in the rdm than in buffer.
however, thermodynamics dictate similar occupancy of
otherwise similar protein sites in different environments when
referenced to the same standard state (in this case, water).
in other words, preferential partitioning of halothane into
lipids as compared to water indicates lower binding constants
for the same protein site when immersed in lipids (smaller
free energy difference for anesthetic‚lipid-anesthetic‚protein
than for anesthetic‚water-anesthetic‚protein). the lower
binding constants are compensated by the higher concentration, and occupancy becomes equivalent. in addition, halothane labels the 65 kda bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) with
a stoichiometry of ∼5:1 (halothane:protein molar ratio) (36),
far higher than the stoichiometry for rhodopsin in rdm at
a similar aqueous halothane concentration. therefore, both
theory and data indicate that halothane concentration differences between buffer and membranes do not explain
preferential binding to rhodopsin as compared to transducin.
the lack of transducin labeling is due to the lack of specific
binding sites, suggesting that any effects of halothane on
this protein are indirect.
limitations. rapid binding kinetics of small molecules
such as volatile anesthetics preclude conventional binding
studies. we thus used direct halothane photoaffinity labeling
to characterize halothane binding in the present study.
however, the photochemistry involved in the direct photoaffinity labeling technique is complex and not completely
characterized (18). uv light exposure converts the rapid
kinetics of halothane equilibrium binding to covalent linkage
by creating a reactive chlorotrifluoroethyl radical. accordingly, the labeling produced by uv exposure for 30 or 60 s
in the present study may not necessarily reflect halothane
equilibrium binding. however, close agreement between
equilibrium and photolabeling approaches has been obtained
in several soluble proteins (29, 30). membrane proteins
represent a more complex system, in which features of
potential anesthetic binding sites, such as a lipid-protein
interface, may be fundamentally different from those in
soluble proteins. thus, anesthetic binding sites in rhodopsin
in the rdm need to be further studied using equilibrium
binding techniques.
in summary, the present data clearly show specific and
selective binding of halothane to gpcrs, but not to the
associated g protein. to allow extrapolation to other gpcrs
in the cns, further characterization of the binding sites and
functional effects is required.
