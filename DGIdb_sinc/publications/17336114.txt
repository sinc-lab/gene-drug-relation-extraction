abstract
 xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase ( xxxg858xxx ) dewciency (mim 601240), an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis, presents with mental retardation, extrapyramidal symptoms, autistic-like behavior and epilepsy. other hallmarks are cerebral creatine dewciency, increased levels of  xxxd2244xxx  in body xuids and mutations in the  xxxg858xxx  gene. creatine supplementation partially restores
cerebral creatine content. worldwide, 29 patients have been identiwed and 15 diverent mutations have been reported in the  xxxg858xxx  gene.
ten out of these 29 patients are of portuguese origin. likely, a founder evect and a high carrier rate in portugal exist, since in 17 out of the
20 portuguese alleles the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation was found. we investigated the carrier rate of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation in diverent regions of portugal and conwrmed the pathogenic nature of this missense mutation by transient transfections. anonymous bloodspots (1002) were screened for the presence of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation by snapshot (single nucleotide
polymorphism multiplex kit). eight carriers of c.59g>c; p.trp20ser were detected of which four are derived from the archipelagos.
this suggests that the carrier rate of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation is relatively high in these islands, as well as in other parts of portugal. it also implies that newborn screening in these regions is warranted for this treatable disorder.

introduction
in 1994 the wrst disorder of creatine biosynthesis,  xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase ( xxxg858xxx ) dewciency (mim
601240) was reported [1,2].  xxxg858xxx  dewciency is an autosomal recessive disorder, and patients usually present with
developmental delay in the wrst months of life, muscular
hypotonia and weakness, progressive extrapyramidal signs
and symptoms, mental retardation, epilepsy and autistic or
self-aggressive behavior [2,3]. according to the severity of
the main clinical features (mental retardation, epilepsy and
motor handicap)  xxxg858xxx  dewciency is classiwed as a mild,
intermediate or severe phenotype [4]. biochemically,
patients show cerebral creatine dewciency, accumulation of

 xxxd2244xxx  and reduced creatine levels in body xuids
[5,6]. various methods, including stable isotope dilution gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (sid gc–ms), high
performance liquid chromatography, and tandem mass
spectrometry (ms) are being used to measure these metabolites in body xuids. furthermore, the metabolites can also
be quantitated in dried blood spots by tandem ms [7–9].
conwrmation of the diagnosis is obtained by mutation
detection and enzyme assays [2,10]. patients with  xxxg858xxx 
dewciency, especially if treated early in life, have shown
favorable response to oral supplementation of creatine
monohydrate and dietary restriction of arginine in combination with ornithine supplementation [11].
so far, 29 patients have been described from a total of 22
families (fig. 1a) [4,11,12] showing a broad clinical spectrum from mild developmental delay and autistic features
to severe mental retardation and severe epilepsy. fifteen

amino acids have been reported. recently, ten portuguese
patients were identiwed of whom eight are homozygous and
one is compound heterozygous for the c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser (w20s) mutation [4,13], suggesting a high carrier rate for this mutation. we therefore investigated the
prevalence of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation in diverent regions of portugal.
materials and methods
subjects
anonymous blood spot samples (1002), randomly obtained from various portuguese areas were obtained from the portuguese neonatal
screening committee (porto n d 192, coimbra n d 192, lisboa n d 188,
faro n d 192, archipelagos n d 238).

screening for the presence/absence of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser
dna was extracted from dried blood spots on wlter paper (qiaamp®
96 dna blood kit, qiagen). exon 1 of the  xxxg858xxx  gene was ampliwed by
pcr using the following primer pair: forward primer, 5⬘-ggcggcgcg
cgatcgaggtcgggtcgccgt-3⬘ and reverse primer, 5⬘-cgggg
cagccccggcctcagtttcccctgc-3⬘. ampliwcation was initiated
after 15 min hotstart taq (qiagen) activation step at 95 °c, followed by 38
cycles of denaturation, annealing and ampliwcation (45 s at 94 °c, 45 s at
60 °c and, 1 min at 72 °c). pcr products were puriwed (millipore vacufold multiscreen pcr plates) and subsequently analyzed by snapshot.
the snapshot procedure was performed according to the instructions
of the manufacturer (abiprism snapshot multiplex kit, applied biosystems) using a primer (5⬘-agaactgcagccccgcgt-3⬘) directly
upstream of the nucleotide being involved in the mutation (c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser). calf intestinal phosphatase (cip, 1u/l) was used to remove
excess of dntp, ddntp and primers. the snapshot reactions were
resolved on a genetic analyzer in the genescan mode (abi3100). in case a

heterozygous mutation was detected by snapshot its presence was conwrmed by direct dna sequence analysis of an independent pcr product.

transient transfection of  xxxg858xxx -w20s orf in hela cells
the open reading frame (orf) of the  xxxg858xxx  gene was cloned as
described previously (pegfp– xxxg858xxx ) [14]. in brief, the wild type  xxxg858xxx 
orf has been cloned in frame upstream of the initiation codon of the
enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) within the pegfp-n1 vector (clonetech) thus encoding a  xxxg858xxx –egfp fusion protein. a similar
approach was used to clone the  xxxg858xxx  orf containing the c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser mutation. this orf was ampliwed by pcr using cdna from
a  xxxg858xxx  dewcient wbroblast cell line containing the homozygous mutation with forward primer 5⬘-cgcgcgatcgaggtcgggtc-3⬘ and
reverse primer 5⬘-gaagccgggaaagcttctggtg-3⬘. the pcr
product was cloned in frame with egfp in expression vector pegfp-n1.
this construct (pegfp-w20s: encoding a fusion protein egfp– xxxg858xxx 
containing the p.trp20ser), as well as, the empty vector (pegfp-n1) and
pegfp– xxxg858xxx  were then transiently transfected into hela cells as
described previously [14]. cell pellets for  xxxg858xxx  activity and western blot
were stored at ¡80 °c until further use.
the  xxxg858xxx  enzyme assay was performed according to verhoeven
et al. [10]. to prove  xxxg858xxx –egfp fusion protein expression, all lysates of
the transfectants (30 g) were separated in a 12% sds–polyacrylamide gel
and transferred to a hybond™ membrane by standard procedures. immunodetection was performed using an anti-egfp antibody and ecl detection kit (amersham biosciences).

results
validation of the snp detection by snapshot
to ascertain that the snapshot procedure allows the
detection of wild type c.59g, homozygous or heterozygous
c.59g>c, the procedure was tested using the dna isolated
from a control, a  xxxg858xxx  dewcient patient (c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser homozygous) and a carrier of the mutation
(c.59g>c; p.trp20ser heterozygous). as illustrated in
fig. 2 the three genotypes are easily discriminated using
snapshot.
carrier rate of c.59g>c; p.trp20ser
blood spots from diverent regions of portugal (fig. 1b),
were screened for the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation using
snapshot. eight heterozygous subjects were detected, suggesting a carrier rate of 0.8% (ci 0.2–1.3%). the highest frequency of heterozygous individuals was detected in the
archipelagos (madeira and açores islands, 4/238) and in
porto (2/192). in coimbra and lisboa one carrier was identiwed respectively (1/192 and 1/188). in the archipelagos the
carrier rate may be as high as 1.7% (table 1).

the p.trp20ser allele does not increase  xxxg858xxx  activity in
hela cells
in order to establish the pathogenicity of the c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser mutation, hela cells were transfected with
pegfp-w20s(trp20ser). in contrast to the pegfp–
 xxxg858xxx  transfection, where the  xxxg858xxx  activity did
increase (7766 pmol creatine/mg protein/h), the  xxxg858xxx

detected whereas in pegfp– xxxg858xxx  and pegfp- w20s(trp20ser)
transfectants,  xxxg858xxx –egfp fusion protein (t60 kda, see arrow) is
detected.

activity did not increase upon transfection with pegfpw20s (236 pmol creatine/mg protein/h) nor with the
pegfp-n1 (mock, 320 pmol creatine/mg protein/h).
to investigate proper expression of the  xxxg858xxx  fusion
proteins, cell lysates from the pegfp-w20s, as well as
pegfp– xxxg858xxx  and pegfp-n1 transfected hela cells
were analyzed by sds–page western blot using an antiegfp antibody. high levels of the  xxxg858xxx  fusion protein
(t60 kda) were detected in both pegfp– xxxg858xxx  and
pegfp-w20s cells (fig. 3). in the mock transfectant, the
egfp protein (t30 kda) was present (fig. 3). this shows
that the lack of  xxxg858xxx  activity in the pegfp-w20s transfection is not due to the absence of the protein expression.
discussion
in literature, 29 patients avected with  xxxg858xxx  dewciency
have been described. strikingly, among those, ten are of
portuguese origin and 17 of the 20 alleles contain the same
mutation, (c.59g>c; p.trp20ser) (fig. 1).
this led us to study the prevalence of this mutation
among the portuguese population by snapshot in dry
bloodspots of porto, coimbra, lisboa, faro and the archipelagos. in total, eight carriers were identiwed out of 1002
individuals, suggesting a carrier rate of 0.8% (ci d 0.2–
1.3%). in the archipelagos and porto the carrier rate may
be as high as 1.7 % (ci d 0–3.3) and 1.0 % (ci d 0–2.5),
respectively. in the archipelagos, that include the madeira
and açores islands, the population has lived in relative isolation and this may explain the relatively high prevalence
compared to other regions in portugal. however, porto is a
large urban area and also there the prevalence appears to
be high. these two regions are geographically distant, suggesting that  xxxg858xxx  dewciency occurs more frequently in
portugal than in other countries due to founder evect.
already a high number of founder mutations, of which several are associated with rare autosomal recessive disorders
of metabolism (e.g., the machado–joseph disease [15], gaucher disease [16] argininemia and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria [17,18]), have been detected in portugal.
the molecular approach that we chose to investigate the
presence of the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation has several
advantages: (1) the method is rapid (data available within
24 h), of high throughput and has low costs (2) the results
are reliable and there is clear discrimination between wild
type, homozygous mutation or heterozygous mutation, (3)
the method is easy to implement in a diagnostic setting. a
drawback could be that an expensive capillary electrophoresis system is needed for high throughput analysis. however, in many diagnostic laboratories such equipment is
used for dna sequence and/or gene scan analysis and thus
might already be available. furthermore, in case of suspicion of  xxxg858xxx  dewciency (i.e., high  xxxd2244xxx  levels
in body xuids or by the almost or complete absence of cerebral creatine) in mediterranean countries, the snapshot
analysis may be used to quickly scan for the presence of the
c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation.

the homozygous or compound heterozygous c.59g>c;
p.trp20ser mutation has been found in eight and one
portuguese patient, respectively. furthermore compound
heterozygosity for the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation has
been reported in a spanish patient; the homozygous
c.59g>c; p.trp20ser has also been found in a turkish
patient. the mutation was considered pathogenic as it
avects a highly conserved amino acid residue (fig. 4, see
box alignment: conserved in all species except in canis
familiaris), it was not found in 210 control dutch chromosomes and it is associated with impaired  xxxg858xxx  activity in
wbroblasts. here, we proved that c.59g>c; p.trp20ser is
pathogenic since, in pegfp w20s transient transfected
hela cells, increased  xxxg858xxx  activity could not be detected,
in contrast to the wild type pegfp– xxxg858xxx  transfectants.
successful transfections of both wildtype pegfp– xxxg858xxx 
and pegfp-w20s were indicated by high expression levels
of the fusion proteins as detected by western blotting
(fig. 3).
the heterogenic clinical presentation of the  xxxg858xxx 
patients has resulted in the classiwcation of mild, intermediate or a severe phenotype. early diagnosis of this progressive disorder is important as the clinical outcome in  xxxg858xxx 
dewcient patients appears to be related to the age that the
treatment is started [11]. favorable response to oral supplementation of creatine and ornithine has been shown, but
complete reversal of the symptoms has not yet been
observed in  xxxg858xxx  dewcient patients. diagnosis of  xxxg858xxx 
dewciency is feasible already at birth [11]. initiation of treatment early in life and perhaps at a presymptomatic stage of
the disease will be evective in improving the outcome in
patients with  xxxg858xxx  dewciency. neonatal screening trials
for this treatable disorder have been initiated in various
countries using blood spots and tandem ms. unfortunately, no data has been published yet. neonatal screening
at the metabolite level will allow the detection of  xxxg858xxx 
dewcient patients, who may have novel mutations. in case
metabolite screening is not feasible, screening at the molecular level in portugal for the c.59g>c; p.trp20ser mutation and perhaps in other mediterranean countries, likely
will result in the detection of the majority of  xxxg858xxx  dewcient patients. so far, nine out of 10  xxxg858xxx  dewcient
patients of portuguese origin contained at least one
c.59g>c; p.trp20ser allele. the snapshot method as well
as other snp detection assays could be considered, including pyrosequencing or mutation scanning methods like
dhplc [19]. a disadvantage of primary molecular screening is the risk of identifying heterozygotes, in whom additional investigations (e.g., dna sequence analysis,
metabolite screening and/or enzyme studies) are warranted
to exclude compound heterozygotes, resulting in additional
costs and counseling.
screening for  xxxg858xxx  dewciency in the archipelagos and
porto meets the criteria for a population screening (1) high
frequency of carriers in the target population, (2) availability of a speciwc and reliable test, (3) access to genetic counseling to couples identiwed as carriers, and (4) availability

neonatal screening in portugal, especially in the areas where
a relative high prevalence of c.59g>c; p.trp20ser carriers
has been shown.
