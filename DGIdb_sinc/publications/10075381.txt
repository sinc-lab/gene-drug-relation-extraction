comparison of the effects of  xxxg100xxx 
blockade and angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibition on atherosclerosis
susan hope, peter brecher, and aram v. chobanian

angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors
reduce the development of atherosclerosis in
hypercholesterolemic animals across a wide range
of species. although the mechanism for these
effects has not been well delineated, it has been
assumed generally that both  xxxg99xxx 
suppression and interference with the breakdown
of bradykinin are involved. to determine whether
 xxxg99xxx  receptor blockade provides similar
effects as those observed with ace inhibition, we
examined the influence of irbesartan, an at1
receptor antagonist, on aortic atherosclerosis in
watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits using
the identical protocol that was employed in our
earlier studies involving ace inhibitors. at a dose
of irbesartan (30 mg/kg/day), which was selected
because it appeared to block most of the pressor
effects of infused angiotensin in rabbits, no effect
on atherosclerosis was observed. however, a
higher dose of irbesartan (75 mg/kg/day) caused
reductions in blood pressure and aortic

c

atherosclerosis similar to those seen in earlier
studies with ace inhibitors. the decrease in aortic
intimal surface involvement with irbesartan was
from 38.9 6 3.8% in controls to 24.1 6 3.0% in the
treated group (p < .01). aortic cholesterol content
was also significantly reduced in those animals
(p < .02). the findings indicate that suppression of
the renin-angiotensin system by  xxxg100xxx 
blockade in a genetically hypercholesterolemic
rabbit model causes comparable inhibition of
aortic atherosclerosis as that achieved by ace
inhibition, and that a mild reduction of blood
pressure induced by both classes of agents may
contribute to their antiatherosclerotic action in this
model. am j hypertens 1999;12:28 –34 © 1999

onsiderable interest has been focused on
the potential role of  xxxg99xxx  (aii) in
causing vascular injury and atherosclerosis. several years ago, our laboratory demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)

inhibitors diminished the development of atherosclerosis in the watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic
(whhl) rabbit, an animal that has a genetic defect in
the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor, which
causes elevations in circulating low-density lipopro-

teins and early onset of atherosclerosis.1,2 antiatherosclerotic effects of ace inhibition were also reported
subsequently in several other animal models.3– 6 furthermore, the development of fibromuscular plaques
in the rat after arterial balloon-injury was diminished
by ace inhibition.7
as ace inhibitors have dual effects in reducing
conversion of  xxxg99xxx  to aii and by blocking
bradykinin breakdown, the antiatherosclerotic action
of these drugs could be related to either or both of
these actions. in the rat carotid artery balloon injury
model, studies comparing the effect of losartan, an
 xxxg100xxx  antagonist of aii, with that of ace
inhibition, alone or in combination with a bradykinin
receptor antagonist, hoe140, have suggested that
both the bradykinin-related effects and the inhibition
of aii are important in reducing the response to this
form of arterial injury.8 in the cholesterol-fed rabbit,
contrasting results have been reported regarding the
effects of  xxxg99xxx  blockade on lesion development. inhibition of atherosclerosis was observed with
the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist, e-4177,9 whereas in a
second study, the at1 blocker, sc51316, had no effect.4
the current investigation was undertaken to examine the action of a new  xxxg100xxx  antagonist, irbesartan, on atherosclerosis in the whhl rabbit model.
the pharmacology of irbesartan has been described by
cazaubon et al.10 the protocol used was essentially
identical to that previously employed by us for ace
inhibitors to allow comparisons between the two drug
classes. the findings indicate that  xxxg100xxx  blockade with irbesartan in the whhl rabbit causes a
similar inhibition of atherosclerosis as that attained by
ace inhibition at doses that provide comparable lowering of blood pressure.
materials and methods
low-dose irbesartan (30 mg/kg/day) study in the
initial study involving a 30 mg/kg/day dose of irbesartan, 24 whhl rabbits, which were bred within our
facility, were assigned randomly to either the control
or the irbesartan-treated group. the dose selected was
shown in earlier studies in new zealand white rabbits
to inhibit by an average of 73% the pressor responses
to intravenously administered aii (0.3 nmol) (n. trippodo, personal communication). the irbesartan was
added to the pelleted agway prolab high fiber rabbit
chow (agway, syracuse, ny), which also contained
4% karo syrup to enhance the palatability of the mixture and improve adherence of the drug to the food.1
the drug was administered at 3 months of age when
the animals were approximately 2.0 kg in weight and
continued without interruption for 9 months. control
whhl rabbits were handled identically except that
irbesartan was omitted from the food.

 xxxg100xxx  blockade and ace inhibition

plasma concentration of irbesartan was measured in
11 of the whhl rabbits treated with 30 mg/kg/day
for 1 to 4 months. assays were performed at bristolmyers squibb using solid-phase extraction followed
by hplc fluorescence. plasma irbesartan in these animals averaged 127.5 6 62.8 ng/ml.
systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured noninvasively at monthly intervals using a tail
cuff plethysmograph with photoelectric cell detector
as described previously.1 serum cholesterol was measured at monthly intervals on blood samples obtained
from the central ear artery after overnight fasting.1
all animals were killed with pentobarbital (100
mg/kg intravenous) at the end of the 9-month treatment period. the tissues were fixed by whole body
perfusion with 10% acetate-buffered formalin.1 the
aorta was removed, cleaned free of adventitia, and
maintained in formalin. aortic surface involvement by
atherosclerosis was determined on photographs of the
intimal surface that were projected onto a digitizing
tablet (model sd 402e, wacom technology, inc., vancouver, wa).2 the total area and lesion areas were
traced and quantitated using the national institutes of
health image 1.49 processor with an analysis program for the macintosh computer (apple, cuppertino,
ca). cholesterol content of the different aortic regions
was assayed as described previously.1
high-dose irbesartan (75 mg/kg/day) study because of the failure of the 30 mg/kg/day dose of
irbesartan to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis (see results), a separate trial was instituted using a
larger dose. this decision was based on the possibility
that the degree of  xxxg100xxx  inhibition in the vasculature with the 30-mg dose was incomplete or otherwise inadequate to influence atherosclerosis. in addition, because our studies with ace inhibitors had
suggested that blood pressure lowering might be involved in their antiatherogenic action,11 we used a
dose of irbesartan that produced a 15- to 20-mm hg
average reduction in systolic blood pressure, as was
seen in the studies with ace inhibitors. the 75 mg/
kg/day irbesartan dose was selected from studies in
which doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg/kg/day were
administered over a 1- to 3-week period in a separate
group of whhl rabbits.
twenty-two whhl rabbits were assigned randomly to either control or drug-treated groups. except
for differences in drug dosage, the protocol used was
identical to that described for the lower-dose studies.
statistical analyses of data on body weight, serum
cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate were made
by two-way anova with correction for repeated
measures using the sas program (sas institute, inc.,
cary, nc). the values of aortic surface atherosclerosis
were analyzed by the wilcoxon rank sum test. aortic

for independent measures.
results
low-dose irbesartan study clinical data no significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate, or
serum cholesterol concentration were present between
control and irbesartan-treated animals (figure 1). during the final 3 months of the study, body weight was
significantly less in treated than in control rabbits,
though not during earlier periods.
aortic atherosclerosis irbesartan had no significant effect on aortic surface involvement by atherosclerosis
in either the total aorta or in the individual regions
(table 1). aortic cholesterol content also did not differ
significantly between the two groups (table 2).
high-dose irbesartan study heart rate and serum
cholesterol were comparable in the two groups

throughout the study (figure 2). body weights were
significantly lower in treated than control rabbits during the final 5 months of the trial, but the animals

discussion
these studies demonstrate that the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan, when used at a dose that reduces
blood pressure, inhibits the development of atherosclerosis in the whhl rabbit. the degree of reduction
of atherosclerosis was remarkably similar to that observed with either captopril or  xxxd3409xxx . with irbesartan (75 mg/kg), the total aortic surface involvement
was decreased by an average of 38%, whereas in the
prior studies with captopril1 and  xxxd3409xxx ,2 the
reductions averaged 36% and 37%, respectively.
the 30 mg/kg dose of irbesartan, which failed to
lower blood pressure, was adequate to inhibit most of
the pressor effect of infused aii. this dose also produced steady-state plasma concentrations of irbesartan nearly 75 times higher than that reported to inhibit
the contractile effects of aii on rabbit aorta or to block
aii-induced proliferation of cultured smooth muscle
cells.10 in view of recent reports that  xxxg100xxx 
mrna levels are elevated in atherosclerotic aorta of
hypercholesterolemic rabbits,9 and that macrophages
in atherosclerotic plaques are a rich source of aii and
ace,12 perhaps a higher dose of irbesartan may be
required to inhibit atherosclerosis than that needed to
affect certain other vascular actions of aii.
aii has been shown experimentally to have a broad

range of effects that can induce or be associated with
arterial injury. these include an increase in superoxide
(•o22) anion production, stimulation of arterial
smooth muscle proliferation, reduction of endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation, increased monocyte
adherence to endothelium, enhanced release of  xxxg674xxx  from arterial tissue, inhibition of plasminogen
activation, and stimulation of lipoxygenase production by macrophages with an increase in the capacity
of macrophages to oxidize low-density lipoproteins.13–18 aii, through its effect on the  xxxg100xxx ,
has been reported to increase the activity of nadh/
nadph oxidase, the major source of superoxide
(•o22) production in arterial tissue studied both in
vitro19 and in vivo.13 by reducing superoxide anion
production,  xxxg100xxx  inhibition could also diminish inactivation of  xxxd2738xxx .
bradykinin enhancement by ace inhibition also
may lead to increases in  xxxd2738xxx  (no) by stimulation of cgmp. augmentation of synthesis of no in
cholesterol-fed rabbits by increase in dietary intake of
l-arginine has been shown to diminish atherosclerosis,20 whereas inhibition of no synthesis promotes the
disease.21 the observation that  xxxg100xxx  blockade
can cause an inhibition of aortic atherosclerosis similar
to that induced by ace inhibition does not rule out
the potential importance of bradykinin and  xxxd2738xxx  in the antiatherosclerotic effects of ace inhibitors.
we have observed previously that doses of the ace
inhibitor  xxxd3409xxx , which caused marked reductions in serum and arterial ace activities but which
did not lower blood pressure in the whhl rabbit, also
did not inhibit atherosclerosis.11 in previously published studies on the effects of other antihypertensive
drugs in the whhl rabbit, the calcium antagonists
nifedipine22 and verapamil,23 and the b-blocker propranolol,24 all failed to inhibit atherosclerosis in this
model.
hemodynamic and mechanical factors appear to
affect  xxxd2738xxx  production and release by endothelial cells. flow-mediated vasodilation is accompanied
by increase in  xxxd2738xxx  release.25 mechanical stimuli associated with uniform laminar shear stress (or
low shear stress) can cause potentially favorable upregulation of endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase as well
as of superoxide dismutase and  xxxg1884xxx ,
whereas turbulent shear stress may cause opposite
changes.26 in addition, it has been reported that increase in shear stress may reduce endothelial cell ace
expression.27 whether aii suppression, through blood
pressure or other hemodynamic effects, can cause beneficial effects on endothelial function and protection
against atherosclerosis remains to be determined.
the clinical significance of the current findings is
unclear. no specific data are available concerning the
influence of either ace inhibitor or aii receptor

ajh–january 1999 –vol. 12, no. 1, part 1

blockade on atherosclerosis in humans. several clinical studies have demonstrated that ace inhibitors
reduce the rate of recurrence of myocardial infarction
in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.28 –30 a
recent study comparing the effects of losartan and
captopril in patients with heart failure suggests that
losartan also may have cardioprotective value.31
whether such actions are in any way related to inhibiting plaque formation or reducing the risk of plaque
rupture is unknown. we hope that the large number
of clinical studies that are currently in progress will
provide some important insights into these issues.
