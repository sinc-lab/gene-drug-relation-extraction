summary

 xxxd2807xxx  ( xxxd2807xxx ) is
a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)
which is effective in models of inflammation, pain
and pyrexia. it is effective and well tolerated in the
clinical management of adult rheumatoid arthritis
(ra), osteoarthritis (oa),  xxxg1055xxx , soft
tissue disorders and post operative dental pain.
 xxxd2807xxx  has a high oral bioavailability (95%),
with peak plasma concentrations at 3 to 5 hours
after dosing. it is metabolised in the liver by
oxidative and conjugative pathways and readily
eliminated by the renal and faecal routes.
 xxxd2807xxx ’s strong analgesic qualities are
particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal
conditions such as periarthritis of the shoulder,
since it exhibits actions such as inhibition of cox-1
and cox-2 isoenzymes, inhibition of nuclear
translocation of  xxxg1559xxx  and of metalloproteases, and
modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system.

 xxxd2807xxx  ( xxxd2807xxx ) is a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), of the
 xxxd3029xxx  class without potential for enantiomeric metabolism. this compound has been shown to
be effective in in vitro and animal models of
inflammation, pain and pyrexia1 and has subsequently
been shown to be effective and well tolerated in the
clinical management of signs and symptoms of adult
rheumatoid arthritis (ra), osteoarthritis (oa),
 xxxg1055xxx , soft tissue disorders such as
bursitis and tendonitis, and post operative dental pain2.

this editorial addresses the accompanying
paper by barbara heller and rosanna tarricone on
the management of shoulder periarthritis pain, in
which they studied the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd2807xxx  compared to the comparator drug
diclofenac over a 15 day period. both  xxxd2807xxx 
and diclofenac compared well in the primary study
endpoint of reduction in shoulder pain.  xxxd2807xxx 
and diclofenac were well tolerated and  xxxd2807xxx 
showed better improvement in shoulder function
and in the mental health item of the sf-36 quality
of life component. the study by heller and
tarricone is an addition to the large number of
clinical trials which demonstrate that  xxxd2807xxx 
has equal efficacy in comparison with standard
doses of commonly used anti-rheumatic agents
such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen,
indomethacin etc. in several different painful
musculoskeletal conditions.

 xxxd2807xxx  has a high oral bioavailability (95%), with
peak plasma concentrations which occur between 3 to 5
hours after dosing. it has a long plasma half-life (about
50–60 hours) which allows a once a day administration.
steady state plasma concentrations of  xxxd2807xxx  are
achieved within 4–7 days following repeated oral
administration. there is a reduction in the rate of
absorption of  xxxd2807xxx  with food, but the extent of
absorption is unchanged3.  xxxd2807xxx  is > 99.5% bound
to albumin. the proportion of unbound  xxxd2807xxx  is
increased at higher  xxxd2807xxx  concentrations after single

or repeated doses. this increase in free (unbound)
 xxxd2807xxx  results in an increase in clearance.  xxxd2807xxx 
is metabolised in the liver by oxidative and conjugative
pathways and is eliminated by the renal and faecal
routes. these dual metabolic and elimination pathways
may reduce the risk of disproportionate drug accumulation and toxicity when  xxxd2807xxx  is used in the elderly
and in compromised patients1,3,4.
in this issue, barbara heller and rosanna tarricone have
tackled the tough issue of the management of shoulder
periarthritis5, a painful, often refractory and emotionally
distressing disorder, which causes physical dysfunction.
there are no pain receptors in hyaline cartilage, but
they are present in synovium and subchondral bone.
innervation of joints comes from specific articular
nerves which penetrate the joint capsule as branches of
peripheral nerves, nerve branches from adjacent muscle
nerves and the nerve supply to the fibrous joint capsule,
ligaments and periosteum. the adventitial fibres of
synovial arteries and arterioles are innervated by
sympathetic fibres. a-delta mechanoreceptors are
present in the fibrous capsule and joint pain is thought
to be mediated by stimulation of the a-delta mechanoreceptors and the c polymodal fibres in the synovium
and surrounding joint capsule6.
pain is an activation of the neurosensory system to
produce an unpleasant sensory and psychobehavioural
experience associated with actual or potential tissue
damage. the sensation of pain, or nociception, is an
exaggeration of sensory detection and is the expected
physiological response to an adverse physical stimulus.
the pain occurs as a result of activation of nociceptive
transducers at the site of tissue damage by the
components of the inflammatory response. nsaids
block or modify the inflammatory response and hence
restore the nociceptive sensitivity to the resting state7.
as discussed by heller and tarricone5, shoulder periarthritis results from a number of insults to the shoulder
mechanism and these include the capsule, the rotator
cuff tendons, the labrum and the supporting neural
tissues and mediators. in many patients there is a
sympathetic efferent nerve component as well as
inflammatory and mechanical mediation of nociception
which contributes to their persistent pain.
the sympathetic efferent pain can result from acute
cell tissue damage which causes the release of chemical
mediators such as  xxxg2240xxx , interleukin i-beta (il i-beta),
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), hydrogen (h+) and potassium
(k+) ions, to directly or indirectly sensitise the
peripheral nerve endings to produce pain or primary
hyperalgesia. the a-delta and c polymodal afferent
pain responses junction with the efferent nerve reflexes
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and secondary
sensitisation of tissues in and around the area of injury
results. the sensitisation of the dorsal horn cells of the
1276 editorial commentary: oxaproxin in treatment of pain

spinal cord with  xxxg2240xxx  facilitates the link with the
sensitisation in the injured tissues to form a closed loop
pathway that becomes self sustaining and is referred to
as sympathetic efferent nerve mediated pain8,9. this
persistent, self sustaining pain may continue, even when
the stimuli from the injured tissues begins to subside.
the persistent character of the pain that some patients
with periarthritis experience is consistent with sympathetic efferent nerve mediated pain.
 xxxd2807xxx  is well placed to act as an nsaid with
strong analgesic qualities to be used in a painful
condition like periarthritis of the shoulder, which
exhibits pain derived from the inflammatory response,
mechanical dysfunction and sometimes resultant sympathetic efferent pain6.
 xxxd2807xxx  is an inhibitor of several steps along the
 xxxd208xxx  pathway and exerts powerful activity in
the control of inflammation and pain due to its cyclooxygenase inhibitory effect and the consequent reduction
in prostaglandins synthesis. in vitro studies on the two
isoforms of cox enzyme, performed on human platelets
and human synovial fluid cells, demonstrated that
 xxxd2807xxx  inhibits both cox-1 and cox-2 isoenzymes10.
 xxxd2807xxx  also has a pivotal role in pain and inflammation
regulation by its inhibitory action on nuclear translocation
of  xxxg1559xxx , which occupies a key position in the induction
of il-ibeta,  xxxg1173xxx , 6 and 8,  xxxg2296xxx 
( xxxg2296xxx ), granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor,
cox-2,  xxxg1763xxx  and adhesion
molecules11,12. in a local joint condition such as
periarthritis, intra articular inhibition of inflammation is
crucial.  xxxd2807xxx  can achieve high synovial tissue
concentrations, 100 µm, which are 4–5 times higher than
in plasma, when given at therapeutic doses12. this is also
relevant to the inhibitory action of  xxxd2807xxx  on
metalloproteases13 which can be increased in the synovial
fluid and synovium by il-i and  xxxg2296xxx  induction of
synoviocytes and chondrocytes14.
 xxxd2807xxx  stimulates the activity of the endogenous
cannabinoid system. cannabinoid receptors are present in
joints on the peripheral terminals of primary sensory
neurons, at synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
and in pain-processing areas of the brain15. the breakdown
of n-arachidonyl phospholipase in neuron membranes
results in the generation of anandamide, the endogenous
ligand of cannabinoid receptors, which are able to reduce
pain signal transmission in neurons.  xxxd2807xxx  directly
inhibits the anandamine hydrolase responsible for
hydrolysis of anandamide and thus enhances the local
levels of anandamide necessary to stimulate cannabinoid
receptors and therefore inhibit pain transmission11,12,16.
this action may be integral to the observations by heller
and tarricone that  xxxd2807xxx  significantly improved the
mental health sf-36 quality of life measurement in the
patients with shoulder periarthritis5.

heller and tarricone have evaluated the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd2807xxx  to the comparator drug diclofenac in
the management of periarthritis pain in the shoulder
over a 15 day period5. both  xxxd2807xxx  and diclofenac
compared well in the primary study endpoint of
reduction in shoulder pain. while shoulder function
improved in both drugs, the outcome was significantly
better for  xxxd2807xxx . patient satisfaction with the
 xxxd2807xxx  was significant for the patients’ assessment of
overall efficacy and in the mental health item of the sf36 quality of life component.
this paper is a well done study in a difficult pain
treatment area, shoulder periarthritis. the results add to
the clinical efficacy profile of  xxxd2807xxx  which is well
documented in a large number of clinical trials versus
placebo and/or other nsaids2. these trials demonstrate that  xxxd2807xxx  has equal efficacy and for some
outcomes is superior, in comparison with standard doses
of commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as aspirin,
diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin etc. in different
pathologies. the drug exhibits a good tolerability
profile, in both healthy human subjects and in patients
with inflammatory painful disorders. in the heller and
tarricone study there were no adverse effects over the
15 day treatment period in the  xxxd2807xxx  group. the
literature shows that  xxxd2807xxx  is well tolerated but can
produce mild gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea,
diarrhoea, constipation and occasionally vomiting similar
to other nsaids2.  xxxd2807xxx  is given as a once-daily
dose of 1200 mg but may be increased up to
1800 mg/day in specific painful pathological conditions.
heller and tarricone’s study demonstrates that
 xxxd2807xxx  is a useful choice in the management of
periarthritis pain of the shoulder5.
