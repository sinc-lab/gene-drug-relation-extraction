abstract
amphetamine and substituted amphetamines, including methamphetamine, methylphenidate (ritalin),  xxxd2611xxx  (ecstasy), and the herbs khat and ephedra, encompass the only widely administered class of drugs that predominantly release
neurotransmitter, in this case principally catecholamines, by a non-exocytic mechanism. these drugs play important medicinal and social
roles in many cultures, exert profound effects on mental function and behavior, and can produce neurodegeneration and addiction. numerous
questions remain regarding the unusual molecular mechanisms by which these compounds induce catecholamine release. we review current
issues on the two apparent primary mechanisms — the redistribution of catecholamines from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol, and induction of
reverse transport of transmitter through plasma membrane uptake carriers — and on additional drug effects that affect extracellular
catecholamine levels, including uptake inhibition, effects on exocytosis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and metabolism.

1. introduction: what is an amphetamine?
amphetamine (amph) (1; see fig. 1 for enumerated
chemical structures) and its many derivatives are so varied in
structure and effects that they could be considered the orchids
of the psychoactive drugs. this review addresses the multiple
mechanisms of action that underlie these compounds’ most
prominent and paradigmatic biological effect—to elevate
extracellular levels of catecholamines and serotonin via a
mechanism that is independent of the classical means of
transmitter release by secretory vesicle fusion. we review
current ideas within a historical context to help frame future
research on this rewarding but addictive, popular but despised,
beneficial and destructive class of drugs.
alexander shulgin (1978), a specialist in psychomimetic
phenethylamines, states that ‘‘the name amphetamine
designates one unique chemical and there can be no
justification for its use in the plural’’; nevertheless, the plural
is destined to survive until the language evolves, as the
generic names for many compounds that contain the amph
structure also include the term. for the purposes of this
review, we cautiously define ‘‘the amphetamines’’ to follow
the rules implied by the generic name of the ur-compound as
sharing an a-methyl-phenethyl xxxd2850xxx  motif. the chemists
j.h. biel and b.a. bopp (1978) state the definitive structural
features of amph as (1) an unsubstituted phenyl ring, (2) a
two-carbon side chain between the phenyl ring and nitrogen,
(3) an a-methyl group, and (4) a primary amino group. the
most studied such compounds, amph and methamphetamine (meth) (2), are addressed most specifically in this
article (although meth does not obey the fourth rule,
having a secondary amine). while both compounds are
stellar examples of catecholamine releasers, they simplify
our review by having little affinity for neuronal receptors
(although see section 6.4). this article is not intended to
review data that compare how chemical substitutions to
amph alter the drugs’ efficacy in relation to each
mechanism, an enormous subject [see an excellent review
by david nichols, 1994]. for purposes of comparison, we
nevertheless sometimes discuss chain-substituted ampheta-

mines, such as methylphenidate (3), and ring substituted
amphetamines, such  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma: ecstasy) (4), as well as non-a-methylated
phenethylamines, such as tyramine (5) or mescaline (6)
(both of which also have ring substitutions).
it is often asked if amph and meth differ in effect. the
two drugs show no differences in terms of changes in
dopamine release in the striatum, elimination rates, or other
pharmacokinetic properties (melega et al., 1995), and equal
doses of the two drugs are not distinguished in human
discrimination studies (lamb and henningfield, 1994).
there is, however, a subtly greater dopamine release by
amph than meth in the prefrontal cortex, and likely as a
result, some subtle differences in effects of the drugs on
working memory and behavioral tolerance (shoblock et al.,
2003a, 2003b). amph can elicit somewhat more locomotor
activity in rodents than meth, perhaps due to indirect
effects (shoblock et al., 2003a). the occasional statement in
the literature that meth is more addictive, favored by drug
addicts, a more potent psychostimulant, or has diminished
peripheral activity appears to be unfounded (shoblock et al.,
2003a). by tradition, studies on mechanisms of action are
generally on amph, and studies of neurodegeneration on
meth. this may be because meth is more readily
available on the illicit market due to its easier synthesis,
which uses either a one-step reduction of ephedrine (7) or
pseudoephedrine, drugs that at this writing remain readily
available, or a condensation of phenylacetone and methylamine (cho, 1990). because ephedrine is a stereochemically pure natural product, the first method of meth
manufacture yields only the more active s(+)-enantiomer
(section 5.2).

and alcohol, amphetamines have been administered as plant

products for thousands of years. the principal species so
used are members of the genus ephedra and the tree catha
edulis, known in arabic and swahili as khat (qat) and over
much of east africa as myrrha (miraa).
ephedra sinica, often known simply as ephedra and in
china as ma huang (‘‘looking for trouble’’), has been
recovered from middle eastern neolithic gravesites and
vedic temples in india. the herb has been identified, although
controversially, as soma, the food of the vedic gods
(mahdihassan and mehdi, 1989). a first century ad chinese
book of herbal medicine, shen nong ben, mentions its use for
treating asthma and upper respiratory infections. the major
active component, ephedrine (7), was identified in 1887 by
nagajoshi nagai, a founder of the pharmaceutical society of
japan. in the western united states, a stimulant tea was
brewed from a different ephedra species, the herb mormon
tea (e. nevadensis), so called because it was not proscribed by
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, although a
recent report suggests that new world ephedra lacks
phenethylamine-related alkaloids (caveney et al., 2001).
over-the-counter ephedrine has been a popular appetite
suppressant and widely used by athletes to boost performance.
it was implicated in the death of baltimore orioles pitcher
steve bechler in february 2003 and was banned from use as a
dietary supplement on the american market by the fda in
april 2004. today, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (8) are the
most common precursors for amateur laboratories that
produce meth for the illicit market (section 1).
the fresh leaves of the shrub or tree catha edulis, native to
kenya and somalia and widely cultivated in yemen, contain
the amphetamines cathinone (9) and norpseudoephedrine
(cathine) (10). the leaves’ clinical use was reported in the
11th century by abu al-rihan bin ahmed al-baironi in
pharmacy and therapeutic art (al-motarreb et al., 2002).
the fresh leaves or stems are chewed, as the stored product
racemizes and loses activity. khat is not proscribed by the
koran and is common from the horn of africa through the
middle east. the herb is used by an estimated 55% of the
population of northern somalia (elmi, 1983) and as many as
85% of adult males in north yemen (pantelis et al., 1989), and
represents 30% of yemen’s agricultural product (al-motarreb
et al., 2002). it is associated with gregariousness, feelings of
contentment, suppression of fatigue, and appetite loss. khat is
habit forming, induces paranoia and other behavioral
disturbances (jager and sireling, 1994; yousef et al.,
1995), but is said to produce relatively benign withdrawal
symptoms. khat is incorporated into fascinating and complex
social rituals, particularly in yemen, where homes may
maintain two separate rooms devoted to khat chewing, the
mandher, a small upper story room with many windows, and a
dewan for large social gatherings (al-motarreb et al., 2002).
there is a suspicion expressed in kenya that long-term khat
addicts have motor deficits (personal communication), but
this has not been studied systematically. (myrrha, as the plant
is known in kenya, should not be confused with myrrh, one of
the gifts to jesus by zoroastrian magi (matthew 2:11). myrrh

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

is derived from commiphora myrrha, a different tree native to
kenya and somalia, a region also native to the tree that
provides frankincense, boswellia sacra.)
while additional plant species contain natural amphetamines, including amph and meth in acacia species
(clement et al., 1998) and amph in egyptian jasmine (nofal
et al., 1982), we are not aware of other plants commonly used
to administer these drugs. there are, however, plant products
with components similar to amphetamines. synephrine, a
sympathomimetic amph congener lacking an a-methyl
group, is found in citrus plants including citrus aurantium,
bitter orange (pellati et al., 2002). the world’s most widely
used psychostimulant is said to be  xxxd215xxx , the principal
active compound in the betel nut palm areca catechu, which is
consumed by 10–20% of the world’s population (gupta and
warnakulasuriya, 2002). (n.b., caffeine and nicotine do not
enhance locomotor behavior in rodents and are not considered
psychostimulants.) in addition to  xxxd215xxx , which is not a
phenethylamine, some phenethylamine-like compounds are
present in the betel nut and flower, the ingredients of the paste
known as betel quid. while used experimentally as a
muscarinic agonist, the psychostimulant mechanism of action
of betel has been little studied, although it has been reported to
produce amph-like catecholamine release (wang and
hwang, 1997; chu, 2002).
another phenethylamine analog, mescaline (6), derived
from dried tops of the peyote cactus lophophora williamsii
and related species, avoids classification as an amphetamine
due to lack of an a-methyl group. this plant appears in
native american funerary art of 2000 years ago (furst,
1972), and its use by the aztecs for predicting the future and
other practices was discussed by f. hernandez, the spanish
king’s personal physician, in nova plantarum, animalium et
mineralium mexicanorum historia in 1576. its ongoing use
by tarahumara and huichol indians in mexico preceded the
european invasion. around 1880 it was incorporated by
more northern tribes into the rituals of the native american
church, a religion that includes about 200,000 adherents of
mostly plains indians, and for whom religious use of peyote
has been protected by federal law since 1965, most
specifically by the american indian religious freedom act
amendments of 1994. there are no reports of neurotoxicity,
overdose, or drug dependence from peyote (mccann and
ricaurte, 1994), and the mechanism of action of this drug is
quite different than that of amphetamines (nichols, 1994;
schmidt, 1994), although mescaline has inspired the
synthesis of numerous amph derivatives (section 2.4).
2.2. endogenous amph-like compounds?
it has long been known that decarboxylated metabolites
of the aromatic amino acids —  xxxd2901xxx  (11) from
phenylalanine, its metabolite phenylethanolamine (12),
tyramine (5) from tyrosine, and tryptamine from tryptophan
— are formed in the peripheral nervous system (nakajima
et al., 1964) and the brain (inwang et al., 1973). these

409

compounds have been suggested to modulate affective
behaviors including excitement and alertness, are decreased
in the urine of depressed patients (sabelli and mosnaim,
1974) and are elevated by marijuana (cannabis sativa)
(sabelli et al., 1974). these ‘‘trace amines,’’ however, do not
appear to be stored in substantial quantity in either the
central nervous system or periphery (berry, 2004).
trace amines share with amph several mechanisms of
action and could possibly act as endogenous amphetamines.
high levels of  xxxd2901xxx  applied exogenously or
reached during  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) inhibition elicit
amph-like psychostimulant responses (bergman et al., 2001).
like amph, it releases dopamine in a manner dependent on
the presence of an intact  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) (section
5.3) as assayed using cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis in
wild-type and dat knockout mice (sotnikova et al., 2004),
although a subset of behavioral responses to the compound
were found to be independent of the presence of dat.
it remains to be determined if  xxxd2901xxx  is a
neurotransmitter or released in a regulated fashion; at least
when present in high levels, it would likely be transported
into synaptic vesicles (niddam et al., 1985) by the vesicular
 xxxg2099xxx . other studies, however, variably
implicate release by diffusion across membranes rather than
reverse transport via catecholamine transporters and in some
cases, insensitivity to reserpine (an inhibitor of vesicular
catecholamine uptake: section 3.1) (berry, 2004).
as is the case with mescaline and in contrast to amph,
the trace amines lack the a-methyl group that inhibits mao
(section 6.1), and are thus thought to be rapidly metabolized
in the brain. it remains unknown if local levels of bphenethylamine normally reach concentrations that elicit
endogenous amph-like effects, or even reach levels that
significantly activate receptors, although some of the trace
amine compounds have very high affinity for the recently
identified trace amine receptors (section 6.4).
2.3. synthetic amphetamines
synthetic amph was invented in 1887 by lazar
edeleanu (1862–1941, a.k.a. edeleano), a rumanian
chemist who described its synthesis in his doctoral
dissertation under a.w. hofmann at the university of
berlin (edeleano, 1887). edeleanu later became famous for
also inventing the method to distill petroleum using sulphur
dioxide, providing the tell-tale odor of gasoline distilleries.
amph was bequeathed its generic name from a
contraction of a-methyl-phenethyl xxxd2850xxx . some notion of
the colorful history of this drug can be seen from the 1989
merck index listing, which lists 17 trade names, not even
including such familiar trade names as adderall, benzedrine,
and dexedrine, or for that matter the myriad nicknames used
by drug abusers. of course, chemists have since developed an
astonishing range of synthetic amph derivatives.
following work discussed below by barger and dale that
introduced the concept of sympathomimetic amines (sec-

410

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

tion 3.1), researchers have examined a wide range of
catecholamine-like derivatives for the ability to raise blood
pressure and to relieve nasal and bronchial congestion from
colds and hay fever. amph was independently resynthesized by gordon alles in 1927 in an effort toward
developing synthetic sympathomimetics, and he and his
coworkers are credited with the first report of its stimulant
effects (alles, 1933). walter hartung and james munch
from sharp & dohme laboratories identified amph (called
in that study phenyl-2-amino-1-propane) as a particularly
efficacious sympathomimetic, as well as being particularly
active when administered orally (hartung and munch,
1931).
amph was introduced commercially in 1932 by the
pharmaceutical firm smith, kline and french as benzedrine,
which was the free base administered in inhaler form. the
first report of amph use as a clinical treatment, for
narcolepsy, is credited to myron prinzmetal, a colleague of
alles (prinzmetal and bloomberg, 1935). in 1936, smith
kline and french began to sell benzedrine as 10 mg tablets
without prescription. it is said that the first widespread use of
amph stemmed from word-of-mouth reports spread from
campus to campus following experiments by the department
of psychology at the university of minnesota on alertness in
college students (angrist and sudilovsky, 1978). over 50
million benzedrine tablets were sold during the first 3 years
of availability.
amph was made available by prescription only on
january 1, 1939. initially associated with students, and soon
after with artists, musicians, the armed forces, and truck
drivers, amph’s popularity contributed directly to at least
one deathless work of art, the boogie woogie ‘‘who put the
benzedrine in mrs. murphy’s ovaltine?’’ by harry ‘‘the
hipster’’ gibson (1944).
until 1946, the pharmaceutical industry promoted more
than 30 uses for amph, including treatment of schizophrenia,
opiate addiction, infantile cerebral palsy, seasickness, radiation sickness, and persistent hiccups (bett, 1946; miller and
hughes, 1994). by 1970, annual pharmaceutical production
reached 10 billion tablets, with perhaps 50–90% diverted to the
black market. the united states justice department imposed
legal quotas on amph production in 1971.
amph, meth, and methylphenidate are still very
widely prescribed for weight control, narcolepsy, and
attention deficit disorder. the latter disorder is a particular
concern, as the national institute of mental health estimates
that it is exhibited by 3–5% of the population, and the
number of american children treated with these three
amph congeners increased from 0.6 per 100 to 2.4 per 100
between 1987 and 1996 (olfson et al., 2002). adderall, a
mixture of s(+)- and r()-amph, is presently the most
commonly prescribed treatment in the united states for
juvenile attention deficit disorder. the mechanism underlying its efficacy remains obscure, although it has been
suggested that it is due to a specific enhancement of ‘‘tonic’’
dopaminergic signalling (knutson et al., 2004).

beginning in the spanish civil war, and in all subsequent
wars, amph has been used by the military to promote
alertness. millions of tablets and pills were supplied to
american troops during world war ii, and unknown
quantities were administered to german, japanese, and
british military and support personnel, in particular to the air
forces on long flights and bombing missions. this use
remains current, especially for fighter pilots on long
missions (caldwell et al., 2003), although it has been
suggested that it causes hallucinations, particularly in people
with a common mutation in catecholamine-o-methyl
transferase enzyme (mattay et al., 2003).
an initial report on amph abuse and induction of
psychosis in two cases soon followed its introduction
(young and scoville, 1938), although this was thought to
unmask a latent psychosis. the authoritative documentation
of amph psychosis is credited to p.h. connell (connell,
1958). the addictive potential of amph was mentioned as
early as 1937 (guttmann and sargeant, 1937) but was a topic
of much debate [see discussion in angrist and sudilovsky,
1978] and not fully recognized until the mid-1960s (lemere,
1966). the initial reports of central nervous system
neurotoxicity induced by amphetamines also appeared in
the 1960s (pletscher et al., 1963).
as with cocaine, amph use tends to occur in epidemic
waves. a well-known example occurred in japan from 1947
to 1957, and was associated with returning troops who were
administered amph, partly under coercion, along with
large-scale advertising of the drug to the general public from
manufacturers. by 1954, 550,000 japanese were using the
drug illicitly (fukui et al., 1994). the epidemic ended only
after draconian legal intervention reduced the meth
content of the illicit drug supply (konuma, 1994). another
example occurred in sweden in 1942, 4 years following its
introduction, when an estimated 3% of the country’s
population used amph (rylander, 1972).
as of 2000, the u.s. drug enforcement agency states
that meth is the most prevalent illicitly manufactured
controlled substance, with 6394 reported clandestine
laboratory seizures that year. the dea estimates that 4%
of the american adult population has used amphetamines at
least once. local epidemics are current in both rural pockets
of the united states, including the western, mid-western,
and southern states (f. butterfield, new york times,
february 11, 2002) and large cities. one percent of
wyoming’s population is now said to require treatment
for meth addiction (t. egan, new york times, december
8, 2002). mdma and meth are associated with dance
parties and clubs, and meth use in gay dance clubs in new
york may have reached so-called epidemic proportions (a.
jacobs, new york times, january 29, 2002).
mdma, originally developed by merck in 1912 and
patented in 1914 for use in synthesis of styptic drugs based
on hydrastinine, was used in the united states by
psychotherapists, particularly for couples therapy, from
1978 until 1985 when it was assigned schedule i status.

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

there are nevertheless ongoing efforts by some to
reintroduce mdma for clinical use, as well as a significant
and controversial body of literature suggesting neurotoxicity
in serotonin neurons. illicit mdma is still widely selfadministered, and 9.3 million tablets of mdma were
confiscated in the united states in 2000.
an early effort to synthesize amph derivatives on the
basis of knowledge of structure–function relationships
resulted in trimethoxyamphetamine (tma) (hey, 1947)
(13), due to the addition of an a-methyl group to mescaline
in order to inhibit its deamination (section 6.1). in the words
of david nichols, the synthesis of tma ‘‘began the journey
that ultimately led to the synthesis and pharmacological
evaluation of nearly 200 potentially hallucinogenic substituted amphetamines’’ (nichols, 1994). many other
amph derivatives have been explored for clinical uses,
including appetite suppression (e.g., fenfluramine; 14), and
as mao inhibitors (section 6.1) for treatment of parkinson’s
disease (deprenyl; 15).

3. evidence for multiple sites of action
3.1. history of roles for plasma membrane transporters
and secretory vesicles
the earliest scientific efforts into understanding amph
action raised issues still debated today. this history is
inextricably bound with the study of the adrenal medulla and
its role as a secretor of catecholamines. the term catechol is
derived from the plant product catechu (a.k.a. gambir), a
cake of aqueous extract of leaves and twigs from the black
catechu tree, catechu nigrum, native to burma and india, or
from uncaria gambier, a vine native to india and malaysia.
catechu contains up to 30% catechol, and was traditionally
used to dye fabric brown (although tannic acid, also present,
contributes to this) and as an astringent in the treatment of a
variety of medical disorders.
the british physician george oliver discovered the
ability of adrenal gland extract to increase blood pressure by
injecting it into his own son, noting a contraction of his son’s
radial artery [see a fine review on the history of adrenal
medulla research (carmichael, 1989)]. by 1894, oliver with
edward albert schafer confirmed that this extract increased
blood pressure (in dogs). the compound responsible was
independently identified by three laboratories; stolz, dakin,
and john jacob abel in 1897, a founder of the journal of
biological chemistry, who named the compound epinephrine. the preparation from oxen and sheep adrenals was
patented as adrenaline by the pharmaceutical firm parke
davis. competing claims for priority provide one reason that
this transmitter has 38 different names in the merck index.
ernst joseph friedman published epinephrine’s chemical
structure in 1906.
these findings inspired the hypothesis of secretory
transmission that is the foundation of contemporary

411

neuroscience. thomas renton elliott, a student of john
newport langley at cambridge university, upon confirming
oliver and shaefer’s findings by injecting epinephrine into
dogs, proposed that nerves communicate via release of a
chemical (elliot, 1904), writing that ‘‘adrenaline might then
be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when
the impulse arrives at the periphery’’ [see a fine review on
the early history of neurotransmission (valenstein, 2002)].
not incidentally, elliott also proposed as early as 1914
that nerves could accumulate epinephrine by an uptake
system, suggesting that the adrenal gland might ‘‘depend on
what could be picked up from the circulating blood and
stored in its nerve endings’’, although demonstration of
uptake mechanisms arrived more than 40 years later (section
5.1).
inquiry into pharmacological rather than endogenous
stimulant mechanisms was essentially initiated by george
barger and henry h. dale (1910). barger, a chemist
studying compounds, he isolated from putrid meat, found
that isoamylamine, a weak base that did not posses a
catechol ring, could, like epinephrine, raise blood pressure.
he and dale, working together at the wellcome physiological research laboratories, then examined other noncatechol weak bases for epinephrine-like functions. dale,
the physiologist of the pair, initially assayed the compounds
by observing uterine contraction. they suggested that active
compounds be called sympathomimetic to indicate ‘‘the
relation of the action to innervation by the sympathetic
system, without involving any theoretical preconception as
to the meaning of that relation or the precise mechanism of
the action.’’ sympathomimetic potency was rated by the
effect on blood pressure. among the compounds they
identified were  xxxd2901xxx , and the amph
isomers, b-methylphenethylamine and phenylpropylamine.
in later work by j.h. burn and coworkers, sympathomimetics that caused membrane contraction after sympathetic
postganglionic denervation (and were not blocked by
reserpine) were called directly acting, in contrast to
indirectly acting amines that required innervation to produce
contraction (and had reserpine-sensitive responses; see
below) (fleckenstein and burn, 1953).
another sympathiomimetic, cocaine, derived from the
andean erythoxylon coca and related species, provided
important insights into the mechanisms involved (cocaine is
now understood to act primarily as an inhibitor of the plasma
membrane monoamine uptake transporters: see below and
section 5.1). during the 1880s and until the harrison tax
act in 1914, which restricted coca products, there was a
widespread vogue for cocaine use in the united states
(angrist and sudilovsky, 1978), where it was associated
with the introduction of coca-cola in 1886 and initially
enthusiastic reports by sigmund freud (1884).
in the same year as barger and dale’s study, alfred
fröhlich and otto loewi at the pharmacology institute in
vienna initiated fundamental research into cocaine action,
reporting that cocaine potentiated epinephrine’s increase in

412

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

blood pressure (fröhlich and loewi, 1910). surprisingly, a
later study showed that cocaine did not potentiate but rather
blocked the effect of the paradigmatic sympathomimetic
drug, tyramine (tainter and chang, 1927) even though they
each independently increased blood pressure; this was
sometimes labeled the cocaine paradox.
insight as to why two sympathomimetics respond in
opposite manners to cocaine arrived with the introduction of
reserpine to the west, derived from the indian snakeroot,
rauwolfia serpentina, known in bihar and uttar pradesh as
pagal-ki-dawa (‘‘medicine for the insane’’). snakeroot, a
climbing shrub that grows from the himalayas to indonesia,
was used in the subcontinent for treating mental illness,
snakebite, and scorpion stings for thousands of years. during
the 1940s, rustom jal vakil of bombay’s kem hospital
found it effective for lowering blood pressure, and it was
prescribed to over 1 million hypertensive patients in india.
subsequent reserpine trials by nathan kline of new york
rockland state hospital for treatment of violent mentally ill
patients received extraordinary attention in the west.
reserpine was considered a ‘‘miracle drug’’ and to some
extent replaced electric convulsive therapies and lobotomies. the u.s. news and world report (november 11,
1955) said, ‘‘mentally retarded children improved in
behavior, developed higher iqs. patients with the excruciating heart pains of angina pectoris had both severity and
frequency of attacks reduced. dogs were cured of
carsickness; mares that spurned foals were made normal.
skin diseases have been made less severe, and intolerable
itching relieved. prospects for recovery in mental disease
have risen to 90% from 65.’’ it can be considered the first
antipsychotic drug. however, side effects including nightmare, parkinsonism and gastrointestinal disturbances,
together with the development of other drugs, have limited
subsequent clinical use of reserpine.
arvid carlsson et al. (1957) soon showed that reserpine
blocked tyramine’s increase of blood pressure. yet reserpine
and tyramine did not appear to act at the same site. the
authors suggested that ‘‘tyramine belongs to a group of
sympathomimetic amines which are fully active only in the
presence of an intact adrenergic system.’’ in a variation of
the cocaine paradox, it was not clear why intact neurons
would be required for tyramine’s action, and not for
norepinephrine.
this puzzle was essentially solved by j.h. burn and m.j.
rand at oxford (burn and rand, 1958), who showed that
exogenous epinephrine could still elevate blood pressure
following reserpine, whereas exogenous tyramine, phenethylamine, ephedrine, and amph were no longer
effective following reserpine. they concluded ‘‘the sympathomimetic amines may be divided into two classes, one
consisting of substances like noradrenaline and adrenaline,
which act on vessels in both normal and reserpine-treated
animals, and the other consists of substances like tyramine
which act only on vessels of normal animals and have little
or no action on those treated with reserpine’’ and that

tyramine and amph, which were in the second class, ‘‘act in
the normal animal by releasing a noradrenaline-like
substance.’’
the statement by rand and burn above is to our
knowledge the first clear declaration that amphetamines act
by releasing catecholamines. it also provided a mechanistic
explanation for the difference between directly- and
indirectly-acting sympathomimetics. burn and rand further
provided an important clue toward solving the 30-year-old
mystery of the cocaine paradox, why cocaine blocks the
effects of tyramine, in that ‘‘the action of cocaine may be to
arrest the release of the noradrenaline-like substance from
the store.’’ in other words, their study also introduced the
oft-confirmed finding that uptake blockers also block reverse
transport, although the discovery of an uptake transporter
system occurred only that year in independent work by
barbara hughes and bernard brodie (section 5.1).
thus, many of the current concepts, controversies, and
approaches used to elucidate amph action were introduced
by 1958. note, however, that while these studies used a
plasma membrane uptake blocker (cocaine) to determine if a
drug was a releaser and a vesicular  xxxg2099xxx 
( xxxg2099xxx ) inhibitor (reserpine) to determine involvement of
intracellular stores, the identification of reserpine as a
blocker of vesicular catecholamine uptake per se did not
occur until 1962 (carlsson et al., 1962; kirshner, 1962).
from the mid-1960s through the 1970s, a variety of
studies by numerous groups showed that amph also
released catecholamines in the cns, as reviewed by david
segal and roland kuczenski (1994), following the earlier
work in the periphery. a role for amph in inducing central
dopamine release was suggested, again by using cocaine or
other uptake blockers as amph antagonists (heikkila et al.,
1975b; raiteri et al., 1979; liang and rutledge, 1982;
parker and cubeddu, 1988), as had burn and rand earlier. in
comparing amph with cocaine, mary ritz and michael
kuhar pointed out that while self-administration of cocainelike blockers correlated with their binding efficacy to dat,
amph was far more potent than would be expected from its
binding. the investigators interpreted this finding to mean
that, as found long before in the periphery, release rather
than reuptake blockade may be most important for amph
action in the brain (ritz et al., 1987). a role for plasma
membrane transport in amph-mediated release was
directly confirmed much later by measuring amphmediated dopamine flux through dat and its inhibition
by uptake blockers (sulzer et al., 1995), as well as electrical
currents associated with dopamine and amph transport
(sonders et al., 1997; sitte et al., 1998) (section 5.4).
3.2. plasma membrane versus synaptic vesicles?
while classical pharmacological studies related above
implicate both plasma membrane uptake transporters and
monoamine secretory/synaptic vesicles as playing roles in
amph action, and all subsequent studies concerned agreed

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

on a role for catecholamine transporters, the role of synaptic
vesicle pools has been often doubted, mostly due to results
from reserpine experiments. as discussed, this investigative
direction was initiated by a study demonstrating reserpine
blockade of tyramine action (burn and rand, 1958). thus,
the first such report indicated a role for secretory vesicles in
amph action. the conclusions differed greatly in later
literature due to differences in experimental design. an
extremely brief review follows.
most studies, both on dopamine and norepinephrine
systems, were conducted with in vivo reserpine injections
generally given 24 h prior to amph administration. in
nearly all examples of which we are aware, reserpine
blocked amph release of norepinephrine (kalisker et al.,
1975; fitzgerald and reid, 1993; florin et al., 1995),
consistent with a role for vesicular catecholamine. however,
since norepinephrine is predominantly synthesized from
dopamine within vesicles by lumenal dopamine b-hydroxylase, the fraction of total catecholamine concentration
represented by norepinephrine would be expected to be
lower in the cytoplasm than in vesicles. thus, the effect of
 xxxg2099xxx  inhibition on amph-mediated release could be
greater for norepinephrine than dopamine.
within the literature on combinatorial effects of reserpine
and amph on dopamine release, some in vivo experiments
found little or no effect of reserpine on amph (niddam
et al., 1985; callaway et al., 1989; arbuthnott et al., 1990),
others reported reserpine blockade (parker and cubeddu,
1986, 1988; sabol et al., 1993), and still others found both
responses depending on conditions (florin et al., 1995).
attempts to resolve the issue by examining dopamine
release from synaptosomes yielded contradictory results
(bagchi et al., 1980; masuoka et al., 1982).
one likely explanation for the conflicting findings is that
reserpine causes a delayed upregulation of tyrosine
hydroxylase activity via enhanced transcription (pasinetti
et al., 1990), thus producing higher levels of cytosolic
dopamine. in ventral midbrain neuronal culture, where it is
straightforward to measure all of the dopamine in the
system, shorter-term exposure to reserpine (90 min)
depleted exocytic dopamine release but did not increase
 xxxg2276xxx  activity (larsen et al., 2002), and also
inhibited amph-mediated dopamine release by 75%
(sulzer et al., 1996). in conclusion, the contribution of
vesicular catecholamines to amph-mediated efflux appears
to be greatest when vesicle stores are intact, and may thus be
considerable under typical conditions in which the vast
majority of catecholamines, perhaps >99% (fon et al.,
1997; mosharov et al., 2003), are stored in the vesicles.
under conditions that enhance  xxxg2276xxx  activity
(section 6.2), the role for non-vesicular dopamine may be
much greater.
new approaches to this long-standing question have
arisen over the past decade as genetic manipulations have
allowed the issue of a role for synaptic vesicles in amph
action to be addressed without reliance on reserpine. such an

413

approach to understanding amph action provides a
paradigmatic example of the application of gene knockout
technology when the drug in question has two targets with
functions that are closely intertwined. christian pifl and
collaborators transformed cos cells to express dat, the
central vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2), or both
(pifl et al., 1995). while this cell line lacks synaptic vesicles,
vmat2 expression in other acidic organelles, possibly
including endosomes and lysosomes as well as secretory
organelles, apparently provides a means to accumulate
dopamine. amph released dopamine only in cells that
expressed dat. the release was greater, however, for cells
that also coexpressed  xxxg2099xxx , and whereas dopamine efflux
from dat cells reached a peak and quickly returned to
baseline in the continued presence of the drug, release was
sustained in cells that coexpressed dat and vmat2. the
authors concluded that there was both a plasmalemmal
component and vesicular component in the dopaminereleasing action of amph.
consistent with the results from transfected cell lines,
results from studies using mouse mutants indicate participation of both dat and  xxxg2099xxx  in amph action. cyclic
voltammetry studies by sara jones and coworkers demonstrated that knockout mice that do not express dat did not
exhibit amph-mediated dopamine release (giros et al.,
1996; jones et al., 1998). unfortunately, vmat2 knockout
mice do not feed and die soon after birth (fon et al., 1997;
takahashi et al., 1997; wang et al., 1997), and so could not
be assayed in the same manner. neuronal cultures derived
from vmat2 knockout mice survive, however, and amphmediated dopamine release from  xxxg2099xxx  knockout ventral
midbrain neurons was depressed by 65% (fon et al., 1997).
as was the case for neuronal cultures and reserpine, this
preparation allowed the system’s entire neurotransmitter
pool to be measured. a rapid (30 min) effect of amph was
to increase  xxxg2276xxx  activity in these mutant
neurons (section 6.2), and along with the drug’s inhibition of
mao (section 6.1), this provided most of the source for the
remaining dopamine release (larsen et al., 2002). the
enhancement of  xxxg2276xxx  activity by amph
was far greater in ventral midbrain dopamine cultures that
lacked vmat2 expression or wild-type cultures exposed to
reserpine than in untreated wild-type neuronal cultures.
strikingly, far more dopamine was released into the
extracellular media by amph than was present in the
entire vmat2 knockout cultures at the time that the drug
was added.
the basis for the greater activation by amph of tyrosine
hydroxylase in neurons that do not accumulate vesicular
dopamine remains mysterious. the ability of amph to alter
 xxxg2276xxx  activity may underlie much of the
controversy in the literature of reserpine and amph
interaction, prominently including findings using labeled
dopamine that suggest that amph preferentially releases a
‘‘newly synthesized pool’’ of dopamine [as reviewed and
explored by kuczenski, 1975]. interestingly, amph

414

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

promoted locomotion and survival in vmat2 knockout
mice incapable of synaptic vesicle-mediated dopamine
neurotransmission (fon et al., 1997) — while the basis for
this observation remains unknown, it suggests the possibility
of physiological roles for non-vesicular dopamine release.
finally, perhaps the most satisfying evidence that both
synaptic vesicle and cytosolic dopamine pools both
contribute to amph action was provided by elegant cyclic
voltammetry studies in striatal brain slice by sara jones et al.
(1998). using this approach, dopamine released by electrical
stimulation of midbrain terminals or amph perfusion was
detected at 100-ms resolution. jones stimulated the
terminals at regular intervals until the amount of dopamine
released per pulse was stable. she then continued stimulating throughout the experiment and perfused amph. amph
provided a rapid, relatively small amount of baseline, i.e.,
unstimulated, dopamine release. minutes later, the amount
of dopamine released per electrical pulse decreased while
the baseline stimulation-independent release increased.
thus, it appeared that the greatest amount of dopamine
released was redistributed from vesicles into the cytosol. a
later study showed that a portion of the decrease in
electrically-evoked dopamine release was due to a d2
dopamine receptor feedback mechanism (schmitz et al.,
2001), but also confirmed that the dopamine that previously
resided in synaptic vesicles and was redistributed to the
cytosol was responsible for most of the amph-mediated
release.
a variety of reports suggest the notion that low
concentrations of amph preferentially release catecholamine already resident in the cytosol, whereas higher
concentrations are required to redistribute vesicular catecholamine to the cytosol. if true, with lower drug concentrations
the release is from the cytosolic pool, and with higher
concentrations mostly from the vesicular pool (seiden et al.,
1993). the first such claim we are aware of is from a study in
which ‘‘bound’’ norepinephrine, i.e., that left over in the tissue
after amph exposure, was more efficiently released at higher
amph or tyramine levels (langeloh and trendelenburg,
1987). the ‘‘bound’’ transmitter was assumed to reflect the
vesicular pool.
it has, however, until recently been impossible to
carefully distinguish dopamine in one pool versus the other,
as discussed (parker and cubeddu, 1988), except in the case
of knockout mouse mutants as discussed above. one
prediction that could test a role for the vesicle pool would be
that if amph simply releases cytosolic catecholamine, then
the free catecholamine levels in the cytosol should decrease.
on the other hand, if amph redistributes catecholamine
from vesicles to the cytosol, the free cytosolic levels might
increase.
testing these predictions has required a means to measure
cytosolic catecholamines. an initial approach used an
intracellular carbon fiber electrode to measure free cytosolic
dopamine in a giant dopamine neuron in the pond snail
planorbis corneus (sulzer et al., 1995); exposure to amph

increased cytosolic dopamine, consistent with redistribution
of vesicular dopamine to the cytosol. moreover, when
amph accumulation by plasma membrane transporters was
skirted by an intracellular injection of 100 mm amph,
there was a rapid (within 5 s) increase in cytosolic da,
indicating that the effects on vesicles can be quite rapid. in a
more detailed approach, eugene mosharov et al. (2003)
developed intracellular patch electrochemistry, using a
carbon fiber electrode placed inside a patch electrode used in
whole cell mode, to measure cytosolic catecholamine levels
in chromaffin cells and neurons (mosharov and sulzer,
unpublished). they found that 10 mm amph induced a 15fold increase in cytosolic dopamine within 10–15 min of
exposure, strongly supporting redistribution of vesicular
catecholamines. cytosolic catecholamines returned to near
control levels by 40 min, but cytosolic catechol metabolites
remained elevated as long as amph was present. the
complete relationship between amph concentration and
resulting cytosolic catecholamine and vesicular levels
remains to be elucidated, as do the interacting roles of
catecholamine synthesis and metabolism (section 6), but to
date all results indicate that amph redistributes vesicular
catecholamine to the cytosol.
in summary, experiments using electrochemical detection techniques, mutated transporters, and reserpine in
neuronal cultures are all consistent with the ability of amph
to act on both vesicular and plasma membrane transporters,
and accordingly, to affect monoamine pools both in synaptic
vesicles and the cytosol. these findings also indicate a
generally unappreciated role for amph-induced de novo
dopamine synthesis (section 6.2) in providing much of that
dopamine still released after reserpine as well as additional
effects on catecholamine metabolism that contribute to
amph effects. it may be that amph, but not reserpine,
causes extensive catecholamine release in parts because it
blocks mao (section 6.1); strikingly, while either mao
inhibition or reserpine alone does not increase cytosolic
catecholamine, the combination does (mosharov et al.,
2003). there are additional potential actions of amph on
extracellular catecholamine levels, such as induction of
small excitatory currents at dat (section 6.5), the ability to
directly bind receptors (section 6.4), and effects on dat and
 xxxg2099xxx  expression (section 6.3). the multiple interplay of
these actions easily provides us the opportunity for a verbose
review.

4. amph actions on synaptic vesicles
4.1. early studies on vesicular uptake
given the very controversial role for synaptic vesicles in
amph action, it is interesting that effects of these drugs on
isolated vesicles have long been noted. the first secretory
vesicles studied were, not surprisingly, the so-called
chromaffin vesicles of the adrenal gland. the term

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

chromaffin was introduced in 1902 by alfred kohn (1867–
1959) (kohn, 1902) of the prague german medical faculty,
who later survived imprisonment in the nazi’s theresienstadt (terezin) concentration camp (carmichael, 1989).
he used the term to describe both the reaction of chromate
salts to produce a brown color and the cells that reacted. in
1918, william cramer showed that reaction with osmic acid
vapor demonstrated ‘‘adrenalin granules’’ with the ‘‘appearances of fine coal dust scattered over the medulla’’ and
suggested that adrenaline secretion to the blood was
mediated by these organelles, effectively extending eliot’s
secretory hypothesis, but now suggesting structures that
might be involved. the above terms were combined by
fritiof stif sjostrand to coin the phrase chromaffin granules
(carmichael, 1989) although they are genuine secretory
vesicles, and the terms chromaffin granules and chromaffin
vesicles are interchangeable.
the first report that amph-like compounds redistribute
catecholamines from isolated vesicles preceded the demonstration of catecholamine uptake by vesicles. in 1953,
hermann blaschko with arnold welch and nils-åke hillarp
and coworkers independently published means to isolate
chromaffin vesicles by centrifugation. in 1960–1962, h.j.
schümann and coworkers showed that tyramine, bphenethylamine, amph, meth, and ephedrine each
induced the release of catecholamines, but not atp, from
suspended chromaffin vesicles (schümann and weigmann,
1960; schümann and philippu, 1961, 1962). they also
showed that tyramine and  xxxd2901xxx  were accumulated into chromaffin vesicles stoichiometrically with
catecholamine release. they concluded that amph (and
similar compounds) ‘‘acts by displacement of the catechol
amines without releasing equivalent amounts of atp.’’
these results were confirmed by carlsson and coworkers
for a variety of amines, including ephedrine, mescaline, and
 xxxd3007xxx  ( xxxd3007xxx : n-diphenylpropyl-amphetamine)
(16) (carlsson and hillarp, 1961; carlsson et al., 1963).
they noted that, except for reserpine,  xxxd3007xxx  was the
most potent amine inhibitor of vesicular catecholamine
uptake. moreover,  xxxd3007xxx  was far more efficacious
than reserpine at promoting efflux from the vesicles, and at
‘‘higher [10 mm], but still very low concentrations it caused
complete release of the granule amines,’’ making it ‘‘the
most active releasing agent known to date, apart from
mercuric chloride.’’ uptake of norepinephrine into isolated
small synaptic vesicles was later shown by charles rutledge
and coworkers to be inhibited by amph and less potently by
eight amph analogs (knepper et al., 1988).
a closely related concept to the uptake of amph in
secretory vesicles is that of the ‘‘false transmitter’’ (kopin,
1968). in this scenario, a molecule other than the native
biogenic amine transmitter is accumulated within a secretory
vesicle and is then available for release during exocytic
fusion. in the process of being loaded into secretory vesicles,
the false transmitters promote non-exocytic efflux of the
native catecholamines by displacing them from storage

415

vesicles into the cytoplasm and ultimately into the
extracellular milieu. acutely, the false transmitters indirectly
promote sympathomimetic activity whereas they diminish it
over longer periods by reducing vesicular stores. the
paradigmatic false transmitter is tyramine, and it is thought
that dietary tyramine of microbial origin found in red wine,
beer, cheese, and sausage promotes hypertension in patients
taking mao inhibitors by a false transmitter action.
one prediction stemming from the hypotheses above is
that if drugs such as amph and tyramine redistribute
dopamine from synaptic vesicles, the drug should decrease
the amount of transmitter released per secretory vesicle
fusion event, i.e., the ‘‘quantal size.’’ this prediction became
testable with the development of carbon fiber electrodes
capable of recording quantal exocytosis by amperometry,
initially (as usual) from adrenal chromaffin cells (wightman
et al., 1991). using this technology, amph provided the first
instance of a manipulation that affected the quantal size of
catecholamine release, as amperometric recordings in pc12
cells, an adrenal chromaffin cell-derived cell line, demonstrated that 10 mm of amph for 10 min decreased quantal
size by 50% (sulzer et al., 1995).
decreased quantal size by amph and other weak bases
was later confirmed in chromaffin cells (mundorf et al.,
1999) and the giant dopamine neuron of planorbis corneus.
using the latter system, andrew ewing and coworkers
demonstrated the existence of two classes of dopamine
vesicles that were differentially depleted by amph
(anderson et al., 1998): at low concentrations, amph
preferentially depleted the large vesicles, while at higher
concentrations, amph depleted small vesicles more than
large vesicles. interestingly, biphasic effects of amphetamines also occur in isolated chromaffin vesicles (slotkin and
kirshner, 1971), possibly due to lipophilic diffusion vs.
 xxxg2099xxx -mediated uptake, although the basis for this
observation remains enigmatic.
4.2. vesicular ph and catecholamine accumulation
amph is a lipophilic weak base with a pk of 9.9 (mack
and bö xxxg1566xxx , 1979) and is thus protonated in acidic
organelles including catecholamine vesicles (sulzer and
rayport, 1990): once charged, it is less membrane permeable and accumulates in the acidic structure.
not surprisingly given the preceding discussion, chromaffin vesicles were the first subcellular organelle shown to
acidify, as well as to use the resulting electrochemical
gradient to provide the energy for accumulation of
intravesicular transmitter. following the elucidation of the
vacuolar  xxxg215xxx  (known as the v-atpase), again in
chromaffin vesicles (cidon and nelson, 1983), it became
clear that all components of the secretory system, including
endosomes, lysosomes, and the golgi apparatus, use this
system to regulate internal acidity.
the acidic ph gradient in secretory vesicles provides the
energy to accumulate transmitter against its concentration

416

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

gradient. literature on vesicular uptake of catecholamines
and its relationship to vesicular ph gradients is featured in an
extensive review (johnson, 1988). the vesicular monoamine
transporters used to harness this energy to selectively
accumulate catecholamines, histamine, and serotonin were
initially cloned by robert edwards and coworkers from a
chromaffin cell tumor line (pc12 cells) (liu et al., 1992),
and later termed the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  1
( xxxg2098xxx ). soon to follow was the description of a closely
related gene expressed preferentially in the cns now known
as vmat2 (erickson et al., 1992; liu et al., 1992).
there is extensive evidence that amph is a substrate for
both vmats. by measuring inhibition of serotonin uptake
into cho cells transfected to express either  xxxg2098xxx  or
vmat2, doris peter et al. (1994) found a nearly 10-fold
higher affinity for meth at vmat2, with a preference for
the s(+)-isomer. they also demonstrated competition for
binding between meth and reserpine, suggesting they
might bind to the same site on  xxxg2099xxx . george uhl’s
laboratory similarly reported that amph displaced the
vmat2 blocker  xxxd3330xxx  (gonzalez et al., 1994).
it should be noted that  xxxd3330xxx  and reserpine are
thought to bind to different sites on  xxxg2099xxx  (schuldiner et al.,
1993a), and that the means by which amph apparently
displaces both ligands is still not understood. nevertheless,
the antagonism of  xxxg2099xxx  ligand binding by amph supports
the possibility of its transport.
in fibroblasts transfected to express either  xxxg2098xxx  or
vmat2, jeffrey erickson et al. (1996) found that bphenethylamine, amph, and mdma exhibited 10- to 20fold higher affinity for vmat2 than  xxxg2098xxx , whereas
fenfluramine had similar affinity for both transporters. for
both vmats, s(+)-amph was about 5-fold more potent
than the r()-isomer. it should be noted that, as has also
been true with the plasma membrane transporters, it is
difficult to design experiments to prove that amph is an
actual substrate, in part due to its lipophilicity and retention
in acidic compartments due to its charge.
there are at least two non-exclusive hypotheses that may
explain the mechanism by which amph redistributes
vesicular monoamines to the cytosol, the weak base
hypothesis and  xxxg2099xxx  competition.
4.3. the weak base hypothesis
all sympathomimetics are weak bases with amine
moieties that are capable of accepting protons with pk’s
in the range of 8 to 10 (sulzer and rayport, 1990).
secretory vesicles are acidic; chromaffin vesicles, which are
the best characterized, maintain a ph of 5.0–5.6, depending
on conditions (johnson, 1988; pothos et al., 2002; markov
et al., submitted for publication) that as above (section 4.2)
provide the energy to accumulate monoamine transmitters.
the final catecholamine concentration gradient at equilibrium is impressive; given sufficient synthesis (in dopamine
neurons and chromaffin cells, following administration of

the precursor l-dopa), vesicles can achieve levels that, if
they were free in solution, would be close to a molar (staal
et al., 2004). as cytosolic catecholamine levels in
chromaffin cells are 10 mm (mosharov et al., 2003),
acidification provides the energy to maintain an accumulation of about 100,000-fold.
whether used as drugs or not, weak base compounds that
are sufficiently membrane permeable to enter secretory
vesicles bind free protons, alkalinize the existing acidic ph
gradient and thus decrease the energy that provides
accumulation of neurotransmitter. the alkalinization of
vesicle interiors by amph was initially demonstrated on
isolated chromaffin vesicles and in organelles (likely a
combination of several secretory organelles) of cultured
midbrain dopamine neurons (sulzer and rayport, 1990)
labeled with the weak base vital dye acridine orange to
provide real time observation of vesicular ph gradients. the
concentration required for amph to collapse 50% of the
chromaffin vesicle proton gradient was 50 mm for isolated
vesicles. the effect of amph on chromaffin vesicle ph
gradients was neither stereo-specific nor blocked by
reserpine, suggesting that much of its entry into the isolated
vesicle preparation was due to lipophilic diffusion rather
than via  xxxg2098xxx .
similar results were later reported for mdma, fenfluramine, and parachloroamphetamine (pca) (17) on isolated
chromaffin granules (rudnick and wall, 1992; schuldiner
et al., 1993b). those authors suggested that the effect of
pca on vesicles was solely due to effects on ph, whereas
mdma and fenfluramine exerted effects both by altering
both ph gradients and vesicular transport.
the hypothesis of vesicular ph gradient collapse by
amph has recently been confirmed in cultured chromaffin
cells with improved estimates of ph using fluorescent
ratiometric methods. this approach showed that 100 mm
meth at 30 min can almost completely collapse the ph
gradient in chromaffin vesicles; surprisingly, longer-term
meth (24 h) can lead to a rebound acidification with an
accompanying delayed increase in quantal size (markov
et al., submitted for publication); the mechanism underlying
this apparent compensation is unknown.
the weak base hypothesis provides a straightforward
explanation for the alkalinization of vesicular ph gradients
observed with amph, and at least a partial explanation of
amph’s decrease of quantal size (section 4.1) and its
increase of cytosolic dopamine (section 3.2). even
compounds such as ammonium chloride and chloroquine,
agents long used to disrupt ph gradients in the laboratory,
release dopamine from cultured dopamine neurons (sulzer
et al., 1993) and intact striatum as measured by microdialysis (sulzer et al., 1992) via reverse transport following
vesicle alkalinization. to date, all compounds that collapse
vesicular ph gradients, including the weak bases chloroquine and ammonium chloride (mundorf et al., 1999;
pothos et al., 2002), and vesicular chloride channel blockers
and the h+-atpase inhibitor  xxxd279xxx  (pothos et al.,

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

2002), lower the number of catecholamine molecules in
vesicles in situ, i.e., decrease quantal size (sulzer and
pothos, 2000), presumably by redistribution to the extravesicular milieu following ph gradient collapse.
there are, however, phenomena that occur at vesicles that
are not explained by this action. first, there is no
straightforward relationship between effects on ph gradients
and monoamine accumulation (reith and coffey, 1994).
second, the effect of ph gradient collapse on monoamine
release from isolated vesicles is comparatively less efficient
than that on monoamine uptake (sulzer and rayport, 1990);
this contrasts with findings of more effective amphmediated release than uptake blockade at plasma membrane
transporters (section 5). the lower efficiency of release with
vesicles could be due to the presence of intravesicular
monoamine binding sites, such as chromogranins and
additional glycosaminoglycan groups, both soluble and
resident in the vesicle membrane, that continue to bind
catecholamines in alkalinized states (and decrease the
genuine free concentration of transmitter in vesicles).
several studies have tested the weak base hypothesis by
comparing effects on vesicular ph and catecholamine
redistribution. in isolated synaptic vesicles from whole rat
brain, 3 mm amph depleted at least 70% of previously
accumulated labeled dopamine, but only collapsed the
proton gradient by 12% (floor and meng, 1996), although
the level of alkalinization from higher levels of amph
(100 mm) appeared to correlate with release. in
chromaffin granule ghosts, amph inhibited dopamine
uptake more effectively than expected from its collapse of
ph (reith et al., 1993). another indication that
alkalinization may not be sufficient to fully explain
redistribution of vesicular dopamine is that  xxxd279xxx , a
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitor that is not a  xxxg2099xxx  substrate,
decreased the ph gradient 2-fold more than amph (floor
and meng, 1996), but released dopamine at only half the
rate. [it should be noted, nevertheless, that  xxxd279xxx ,
like amph and control weak bases like chloroquine, is
quite effective at decreasing quantal size from vesicles
that are resident in neurons and secretory cells (pothos
et al., 2002).]
the arguments above should also be tempered by
considering that the suspension buffer greatly affects the
results in these experiments, particularly the chloride
concentration, which provides a counterion that decreases
the vesicular voltage gradient and allows a larger ph
gradient (johnson, 1988; pothos et al., 2002). the floor and
meng study, however, found a similar discrepancy between
proton gradient collapse and da release at both 8 and
90 mm chloride (floor and meng, 1996).
another important consideration is the relationship
between the proton gradient and vesicular monoamine
accumulation is not linear, but rather


¼

417

where [a] is the concentration of monoamine, dc is the
voltage gradient, and z is rt/f = 50 mv. if only dph
changes, one monoamine molecule would be redistributed
for two protons. assuming a typical dc = 80 mv, alkalinization of vesicular ph gradients from ph 5.6 to 5.9, a
seemingly unimpressive change, would in theory lead to a
loss of 75% of vesicular transmitter. thus, an apparently
small change in ph that may be difficult or impossible to
measure, particularly in small vesicles, may greatly affect
vesicular transmitter.
another objection to the weak base hypothesis based on
the relationship between the ph gradient and redistribution
is that in wild-type cho cells, a 2 order-of-magnitude
higher level of meth was required to abolish acridine
orange staining than to inhibit serotonin uptake in vmattransfected cho lines (peter et al., 1994). a caveat
particular to that experiment, however, is that cho cells
do not contain synaptic vesicles, and the effects of meth
were likely measured on other acidic organelles that
accumulated serotonin, such as lysosomes.
perhaps most damning to the completeness of the weak
base action for explaining effects at vesicles is that the s(+)amph stereoisomer is several fold more effective than the
r()-isomer (peter et al., 1994). as the s(+)-isomer exhibits
preferential binding to the transporter (peter et al., 1994;
erickson et al., 1996), these results endorse a complementary role for  xxxg2099xxx  competition.
as an interesting addendum to the weak base effects of
amph, rapid perfusion of the drug as well as nonpsychostimulant weak bases induced quantal exocytosis
from chromaffin cells via a weak base action (see section
6.6).
4.4.  xxxg2099xxx  competition
a recurring theme is that while amphetamines compete
with reserpine binding to  xxxg2099xxx  (peter et al., 1994) and with
ligands for plasma membrane transporters (section 5), it is
not straightforward to prove that they are actually
transported substrates. if it is transported by  xxxg2099xxx , it is
likely that amph translocation from the cytoplasm to lumen
will promote the reverse transport of monoamines from the
lumen since such ‘exchange diffusion’ is a general
phenomenon of carrier proteins (section 5.5). regardless
of whether amph is a  xxxg2099xxx  substrate or merely binds
without being transported, there must be a competition
between monoamines and amph for the uptake site. while
uptake blockade would not itself deplete vesicular transmitter, there is an ongoing leak of vesicular transmitter,
particularly with synaptic vesicles (floor et al., 1995; pothos
et al., 2000; schonn et al., 2003). the combination of these
effects would increase cytosolic monoamines providing that
amph in binding  xxxg2099xxx  does not act like cocaine at the
plasma membrane transporter and block reverse transport to
the cytosol. such blockade appears unlikely as there is a leak
of vesicular transmitter even with reserpine, which binds

418

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

strongly to the cytosolic face of the transporter: in a manner
still not explained, reserpine apparently blocks uptake but
not release through the  xxxg2099xxx . it should be noted that, while
sheer conjecture, the release of monoamines by amph or
reserpine could occur via a different vesicular transporter or
channel.
differential binding of amph and its derivatives to
 xxxg2099xxx  has been measured in isolated vesicles (reith et al.,
1993) and digitionin-permeabilized cells (erickson et al.,
1996), but competition for binding per se is not a simple
parameter to measure since a vesicular/cytosolic ph gradient
is also required for uptake and can be altered by the
protocols used. this point was made explicit by shimon
schuldiner et al. (1993b), who showed that genuine dph
dissipation can yield an artifactual apparent competitive
inhibition in translocation assays. this would lead to an
overestimation of the effects due to  xxxg2099xxx  binding and an
underestimate of effects due to weak base action.
attempts have been made to integrate both hypotheses.
for example, a study on isolated synaptic vesicles from
whole brains and adrenal chromaffin vesicles (reith et al.,
1993) suggested that amph binding to  xxxg2099xxx  is too weak
to provide the underlying mechanism for vesicular monoamine uptake inhibition, although the authors agree that low
concentrations of amph might inhibit uptake with little
effect on ph.
in summary, there are numerous unanswered questions
about the effects of amph on vesicles. a role for amph
uptake competition with catecholamines can be inferred,
particularly at low levels of amph, but remains to be clearly
differentiated from the drug’s weak base effects on
transvesicular proton and voltage gradients, particularly
for synaptic vesicles. the mechanism of how reverse
transport occurs is unknown, and a very old issue of how
reserpine can inhibit uptake but not halt reverse transport
remains opaque. the intravesicular milieu including
catecholamine and amph binding sites and vesicular ion
channels, particularly the anion conductances of cl, may
play important roles that remain uncharacterized. the
rebound acidification of vesicles may have a significant
effect on neurotransmitter release, but this remains to be
explored. as will shortly be apparent, many similar concerns
pertain to effects of amph at the plasma membrane, even
where study of many of these issues is easier to conduct.

5. actions at plasma membrane transporters
5.1. early studies of cellular monoamine uptake
while the sine qua non property of amph at monoamine
transporters is the promotion of monoamine release via
reverse transport, there are yet profound mysteries in
understanding how this works. it is additionally clear that
amph is an uptake blocker as well as a releaser, and
differentiating between elevating extracellular monoamines

by reverse transport or uptake blockade can be difficult. of
course, the many amph derivatives and different transporters maintain different combinatorial properties, an important topic beyond the range of this article.
although a specific uptake system for epinephrine was
theorized by t.r. eliott around 1914 (section 3.1), the actual
identification of a specific transmitter uptake system
occurred more than forty years later by bernard brodie
and his fellow, f. barbara hughes, with many further
insights provided by julius axelrod. axelrod received a
bachelor’s degree in chemistry in 1933 and wrote many of
his celebrated papers as a technician in brodie’s lab before
entering graduate school and receiving a ph.d. 21 years later
(axelrod, 2003). his co-discovery of neuronal norepinephrine uptake along with discovery of catechol-o-methyl
transferase was acknowledged by the 1970 nobel prize in
medicine.
in their initial reports, hughes and brodie examined
serotonin and catecholamine uptake in guinea pig blood
platelets (hughes et al., 1958; hughes and brodie, 1959).
their argument for a specific uptake transport system was
mostly based on inhibition of accumulation by reserpine;
this was prior to the identification of reserpine with vesicle
uptake sites (section 3.1), and they assumed that reserpine
inhibited the plasma membrane uptake site. they concluded
that there was ‘‘an endergonic mechanism that rapidly
extracts serotonin from the surrounding medium against a
concentration gradient’’.
similar findings were soon published for neuronal
catecholamine uptake by two groups. georg hertting and
axelrod (1961) injected tritiated norepinephrine (provided
by seymour kety’s laboratory, which had recently developed the technology) into cats, comparing its presence in
peripheral tissues following removal of superior cervical
ganglia. during the same year, hans dengler et al. (1961)
first demonstrated cns uptake of norepinephrine by
examining cortical brain slices. as had barbara hughes,
they identified inhibition by reserpine but suggested that the
uptake system worked to deliver catecholamines to ‘‘an
intracellular pool distinct from the particulate sites,’’ or in
contemporary terms, to the cytosol rather than to vesicles.
leslie iversen introduced the terms ‘‘uptake 1’’ for
cocaine-sensitive neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and
‘‘uptake 2’’ for the less avid, non-neuronal uptake, and these
terms were widely adopted in the literature. many years
later, uptake 2 was shown to likely be due to the action of an
organic cation transporters on astrocytes (jonker and
schinkel, 2004).
axelrod’s group re-addressed the classical issue of how
and which psychostimulants block reuptake and which
induce release. they initially reported that cocaine blocked
norepinephrine uptake into the nerves innervating heart,
spleen, and adrenal gland (whitby et al., 1960). while burn
and rand had shown in 1958 that cocaine blocked what later
was confirmed to be reverse transport (section 3.1), to our
knowledge, whitby’s study is the first to show that cocaine

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

blocks catecholamine uptake, which is now acknowledged
to be its primary means of elevating extracellular
catecholamine levels.
in a reformulation of burn and rand’s earlier categories
of directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetics, axelrod
divided drugs that elevated norepinephrine levels in the
blood into compounds that (a) prevent norepinephrine
uptake, i.e., lower tissue norepinephrine levels when
administered before the labeled norepinephrine, or (b)
release norepinephrine, i.e., lower tissue norepinephrine
when administered after labeled norepinephrine (axelrod
et al., 1961). the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and
 xxxd1677xxx  were labeled uptake blockers, while
reserpine, amph, and tyramine were considered releasers.
while axelrod confirmed burn and rand’s prior hypothesis
that amph releases catecholamine, he eventually reported
that amph could block both uptake and release of labeled
norepinephrine in the brain (axelrod, 1971), underlining the
reoccurring theme that both aspects at the transporter may be
important.
most of the neurotransmitter transporters were cloned
over a very short period. two families of plasma membrane
neurotransmitter transporters were identified on the basis of
sequence homology: one family includes the norepinephrine
(pacholczyk et al., 1991), dopamine (kilty et al., 1991;
shimada et al., 1991; usdin et al., 1991), gammaaminobutyric acid (gaba) (clark et al., 1992), and
serotonin (5ht) (blakely et al., 1991; hoffman et al.,
1991) transporters and the other includes transporters for
glutamate (pines et al., 1992; storck et al., 1992; tanaka,
1993; arriza et al., 1994). the transfection of these
transporters into cells provided new means to identify
pharmacological effects on uptake and reverse transport.
5.2. how is catecholamine uptake powered?
plasma membrane and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters are referred to as secondary active transporters or
concentrative transporters because they utilize electrochemical energy derived from preexisting ion gradients,
particularly sodium, and the transmembrane electrical
potential. the coupling coefficients of the transporter for
organic substrate and the pertinent ions determine the
magnitude of the substrate concentration gradient at
equilibrium. the monoamine plasma membrane transporters and vesicular transporters are thus analogous in
depending on electrochemical gradients built by other
pumps, but differ in that the plasma membrane transporters
mostly rely on co-transport of driving co-substrate ions with
substrates whereas vesicular carriers counter-transport
monoamines and protons (sections 4.1 and 4.2).
in principle, concentrative transporters must possess at
least one conformation that prevents substrates from simply
diffusing down their concentration gradient. this property is
often labeled a gating mechanism. literature on the traversal
of a substrate or ion co-substrate binding site between

419

internal and external faces often invokes an alternating
access model (jardetzky, 1966), meaning that binding sites
for substrates and co-substrates are alternately exposed to
extracellular and cytoplasmic environments via conformational changes in the transporter protein.
studies by leslie iversen’s laboratory and others indicated
that catecholamine uptake by membrane transporters
followed michaelis–menten type kinetics and required an
ion gradient that would presumably act as a co-substrate,
principally consisting of sodium (iversen, 1963). the sodium
concentration gradient could then be invoked as a means to
provide energy for the accumulation of cytosolic catecholamine against its concentration gradient.
the precise stoichiometry of ion exchange for catecholamines has been the subject of many studies. perhaps the
most notable in neurons was of dat activity in striatal
synaptosomes, indicating that dopamine accumulation
against a concentration gradient required the cotransport
of 2 na+ and 1 cl ions (krueger, 1990), resulting in net
import of two cations per transport cycle, and these values
are now widely assumed under ‘‘physiological’’ conditions
for dat. the stoichiometry of ion gradients have nevertheless continued to be controversial, in part because this
coupling may be altered under different conditions (pifl and
singer, 1999), and there may well be different values for the
other catecholamine transporters. isotopic studies on
 xxxg2148xxx -expressing cells and membrane
vesicles indicated a stoichiometry of one na+ and one cl
for each molecule of norepinephrine for net (galli et al.,
1996), while mammalian sert was proposed to be
electroneutral due to additional counter ion flow (rudnick,
1998). for all of the monoamine transporters, the role of cl
may be particularly variable, even between paralogs (species
variants of a single transporter). the electrical gradient (i.e.,
membrane potential) also contributes to the driving force for
substrate uptake as recently pointed out for dat (section
5.5), but this factor is also likely to vary between different
transporters.
5.3. amph uptake
it might seem that amph ought to be subject to the same
rules for accumulation as catecholamines, but this remains
uncertain, and indeed, as is the case for  xxxg2099xxx  (section 4.4),
it has historically been difficult to determine if amph is a
genuine substrate of dat and other plasma membrane
transporters, i.e., whether it is transported. this is in part due
to the drug’s lipophilicity and accumulation as a weak base
in lysosomes and other acidic intracellular organelles (mack
and bö xxxg1566xxx , 1979). this is an important issue, as if amph
is not a substrate, it may simply block uptake or even cause
release via a channel-like mechanism (section 5.5).
an initial case for specific uptake of amph by
transporters was made in studies of stereospecificity,
although it certainly is possible that binding has stereospecificity even if no transport occurs. a variety of studies in

420

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

the 1970s examined differential effects of amph stereoisomers on plasma membrane uptake transport of tritiated
catecholamines by synaptosomes. in an initial study by
joseph coyle and solomon snyder (1969), the s(+)-isomer
preferentially blocked catecholamine uptake in cortical but
not striatal synaptosomes. as there is more dopamine in the
striatum and more norepinephrine in the cortex, it was
suggested that the s(+)-isomer was more effective than the
r()-isomer at the norepinephrine than the dopamine
uptake system. most follow-up studies, as reviewed by
kenneth moore (1978), however, found the opposite
response, with the s(+)-isomer more potent at blocking
dopamine uptake by dat, and less stereoselectivity for net.
presently, selectivity for the s(+)-isomer by dat is widely
accepted.
while there was evidence of cocaine inhibition of amph
uptake into heart tissue in the 1960s (ross and renyi, 1966),
the classic demonstration of genuine amph uptake in
neuronal-like cells did not occur until 1984 (bö xxxg1566xxx , 1984),
mostly due to the aforementioned background uptake due to
the drug’s lipophilic nature. for instance, although cho et al.
(1975) demonstrated that the more hydrophilic metabolite 4hydroxyamphetamine (23) could be accumulated by way of
the dopamine carrier in rat striatal synaptosomes, they were
unable to demonstrate temperature-dependent uptake of
amph itself. h. bö xxxg1566xxx  used pc12 cells, a cancer
(phaeochromocytoma) cell line of rat chromaffin cells with
neuronal characteristics (greene and tischler, 1976). this
study finally confirmed that cellular accumulation of
radiolabeled amph was indeed similar to that of labeled
norepinephrine in that it required na+ and cl, and was fully
blocked by cocaine and desipramine. pc12 cells were later
shown to endogenously express the net but not the dat
(lorang et al., 1994).
the first convincing data we are aware of that confirmed
amph as a transporter substrate in true neurons were from
careful experiments using low concentrations (5 nm) of
radiolabeled amph and striatal synaptosomes by robert
zaczek et al. (1991a). they showed that amph accumulation was saturable, ouabain-sensitive (ouabain blocks na+/
k+ exchange, and thus runs down the na+ gradient required
for uptake) and temperature-dependent, consistent with
active transport. they estimated an apparent km of 97 nm
and vmax of 3.0 fmol/mg tissue/min for s(+)-amph uptake
into striatal tissue. the dat blockers gbr12909, methylphenidate, and cocaine, as well as meth, were potent
inhibitors of amph accumulation while serotonin was
relatively weak, presumably because striatal amph uptake
relied on dat, which is much more highly expressed in the
striatum than sert.
the same study also confirmed as discussed above that
s(+)-amph was an 8-fold more potent inhibitor of the
transport than r()-amph at blocking dopamine uptake
(see also preferential binding of the s(+)-isomer at  xxxg2099xxx ,
section 4.1, and at mao, section 6.1). interestingly, the
lab’s accompanying study showed evidence that the amph

once accumulated into the cytoplasm may not be free but
rather bound to small soluble acidic peptides in the cytosol
(zaczek et al., 1991b).
more recently, whole cell electrophysiological recordings of the transporter-mediated currents have convincingly
shown that amph is a genuine substrate for the transporters,
as related in section 5.4. given that, it may be surprising that
the ionic stoichiometry for amph uptake remains
uncharacterized. it may be that binding and transport have
different requirements. it appears that amph binds even in
the absence of extracellular na+, whereas high affinity
binding of cocaine analogs appears more strongly affected
by na+ removal (reith et al., 1980; sonders et al., 1997; li
et al., 2002; wang et al., 2003).
5.4. differentiating uptake blockade from release
very early work found that cocaine and other uptake
blockers inhibit tyramine-induced increase of extracellular
catecholamines (tainter and chang, 1927) (section 3.1), and
much later, a similar inhibition by cocaine was reported for
amph-mediated release (fischer and cho, 1979; liang and
rutledge, 1982; parker and cubeddu, 1988). those findings,
however, only demonstrated a role for plasma membrane
transporters. cocaine sitting at the entry site of the
transporter should in principle block both uptake and
reverse transport. while one might imagine that uptake
blockade precedes reverse transport, until quite recently,
available approaches were too slow to differentiate whether
cocaine blocked amph action due to its inhibition of
amph uptake as a substrate or its blockade of dopamine
reverse transport (heikkila et al., 1975a).
thus, analogous to the problems related above in proving
that amph was a transported substrate, it was difficult to
prove directly that catecholamines could undergo reverse
transport, and it was argued that transporters might be
designed so as to not allow reversal. a real time
demonstration of this function via dat was finally provided
from studies using the giant dopamine neuron of the pond
snail planorbis corneus. dopamine was injected directly
into the cytosol by a pipette and its efflux from the neuron
measured by amperometric recording, thus avoiding the
problem with concurrent uptake blockade. the resulting
dopamine efflux was completely and reversibly blocked by
the uptake inhibitor  xxxd2746xxx , thus indicating that all of
the detectable dopamine was released by reverse transport
(sulzer et al., 1995). since the released dopamine was never
taken up by the transporter, this further suggested that
reverse transport occurred when an equilibrium across the
transporter was disrupted. similarly, when amph was
directly injected into the cytosol, dopamine was released in a
 xxxd2746xxx -inhibitable manner even though amph had not
been accumulated by the transporter. these findings
indicated not only amph-induced reverse transport in the
absence of uptake blockade, but also that uptake and reverse
transport can be dissociated under some circumstances. (as

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

well as strongly suggesting a role for amph-mediated
redistribution and subsequent release of synaptic vesicle
dopamine.) later studies of labeled ne flux in transfected
cells confirmed that reverse transport and uptake blockade
both occur, dependent in part on amph concentration (pifl
et al., 1999).
a rapid method that can characterize compounds as uptake
blockers or transported substrates is to measure the
transporter-associated ion currents (section 5.1) that accompany substrate uptake. this approach was first approached by
recording a heterologous system of cloned dat in the oocyte
of the african clawed frog, xenopus laevis (sonders et al.,
1997). known substrates of dat induce na+-dependent
currents mediated by dat, whereas non-substrate inhibitors
of the transporter such as cocaine block these currents.
because amph elicited such ‘‘transport-associated currents,’’ this electrophysiological approach thus clearly
identified amph as a dat substrate regardless of its ability
to lipophilically traverse the membrane. this approach further
indicated that the amph derivative methylphenidate (3), for
instance, was not a substrate but rather a dat blocker. given
ritalin’s widespread use as a pharmacotherapy for adhd in
children and adults and the neurotoxicity associated with the
class of releasers, this might be considered welcome news
(section 2.3).
the extent of contributions of both reverse transport and
uptake blockade to amph action in striatum were finally
measured using rapid electrochemical recordings in brain
striatal slice preparations and a ‘‘random walk/finite
difference’’ analysis that incorporated michaelis–menten
kinetics. (a tutorial on this approach is available at http://
cumc.columbia.edu/dept/neurology/sulzer/download.html.)
the results showed that amph’s effect on dopamine
overflow was due primarily to reverse transport but that
uptake inhibition also contributed a substantial component
of the total effect (schmitz et al., 2001).
5.5. models of how amph activates reverse transport
if neurotransmitter transporters had no gating mechanism
they could not maintain a high level of cytosolic substrate.
their obvious ability to concentrate substrate could arise
from either of two non-exclusive mechanisms: (1) the
transporter could function asymmetrically, operating more
efficiently for uptake, or (2) the prevailing gradient of
pertinent ions, substrate, and membrane potential might
determine substrate flux to favor uptake.
current research suggests that both mechanisms are
important. for instance, for the gaba transporter  xxxg2143xxx ,
gaba elicits ‘‘transport currents’’ (a surrogate measure of
gaba flux) with clear asymmetries (hilgemann and lu,
1999). in contrast, some mutants of the bacterial lactose
permease transporter affect both uptake and reverse transport
equally (abramson et al., 2003), while glycine transporters
appear to transport substrate according to the imposed
electrochemical gradient (roux and supplisson, 2000).

421

for reverse transport to be effective, one or both of these
functions needs to be countervailed, and accordingly, there
are at least two non-exclusive hypotheses that may explain
the mechanism by which amph enhances reverse transport.
we label these as:
(1) facilitated exchange diffusion: this implies a net
asymmetric substrate flux due to intrinsic structural
properties, and in its classical formulation, an upper
limit of one-for-one molecular exchange of amph for
catecholamine.
(2) channel-like transport modes: this implies a reliance on
transmembrane gradients for net flux and an exchange
ratio that can exceed one-for-one catecholamine
exchange of amph.
as related below, there are also hypotheses that integrate
both mechanisms.
5.5.1. facilitated exchange diffusion
the most prominent model in the literature used to
explain how amph induces monoamine release at plasma
membrane uptake transporters is the facilitated exchange
diffusion model. this is based on concepts introduced by
wilfred stein and coworkers at hebrew university to
describe glucose transport (stein, 1967). the model relies on
a binding site for substrate that can crisscross the plasma
membrane. to accumulate cellular glucose, the binding site
would take up a molecule of glucose extracellularly and then
translocate the molecule across the membrane to release the
glucose in the cytosol. reverse transport would occur when
the binding site faces the cytosol after release of the
substrate, where it could bind another molecule of cytosolic
glucose and later release it extracellularly following its retransversal to the external site. an important aspect of this
classical model is that the traversal of the binding site is
driven by the substrate; thus, there would be a limit of no
more than one molecule of glucose released from the cell for
each molecule taken up.
an important facet of this model is the question of why
there would be relatively little reverse transport of substrate,
since as above, there would otherwise be no net cytosolic
accumulation. in stein’s classical formulation of the model,
transport in the reverse direction would be relatively
infrequent due to sodium binding to the binding site, which
would be much more frequent at the extracellular face and
would favor a confirmation that preferentially elicits uptake.
this idea was specifically extended to catecholamine
transporters by donald bogdanski and brodie, who
suggested that sodium ions, present at higher levels on
the extracellular surface, would favor an outward facing
orientation (bogdanski and brodie, 1969). this hypothesis
essentially partakes of both the idea of transporter
asymmetry and that a transporter can be driven by
transmembrane gradients. thus, while there is still an upper
limit of one molecule of glucose released for each molecule

422

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

taken up, uptake under normal sodium gradients would
exceed efflux.
in its adaptation to explaining amph action (paton,
1973), facilitated exchange diffusion states that amphinduced dopamine release resulted from translocation of
amph as a substrate of dat, thus increasing the probability
that the dat binding sites face the cytosol. then dopamine,
which is at higher concentration in the cytosol, could bind
the internalized binding site, thereby increasing the rate of
reverse transport of dopamine. a molecule of dopamine
released by reverse transport would follow the uptake of an
amph molecule, and in this model’s classical form, there
would be at most one molecule of dopamine released for
each molecule of amph taken up. since there is less
intracellular sodium to immobilize the inward face, most of
the reverse traversals of the binding sites would return
empty. thus, amph would work by increasing the rate of
outward-to-inward traversals and increasing the opportunity
for intracellular dopamine to bind and be carried outwards.
also by this model, any external substrate, including
dopamine itself, would be predicted to stimulate counterflux
of internal substrate molecules.
in 1969, hans thoenen et al. showed that tyraminemediated norepinephrine release from cat iris required the
presence of external sodium. this supported the idea that
amph-like releasers must be accumulated by plasma
membrane transporters to induce release. the first suggestion that facilitated exchange diffusion per se underlies
sympathomimetic-mediated catecholamine release was by
d.m. paton in 1973 in a study that showed that tyramine and
 xxxd2584xxx  (30 ,alpha-dihydroxyamphetamine) increased
efflux of norepinephrine from rabbit atria in a manner
inhibited by cocaine or the norepinephrine uptake blocker
desipramine. while essentially a restatement of the old
‘‘cocaine paradox’’, and not substantially different than
much earlier experiments by burns and others (section 2),
paton interpreted the results to indicate that ‘‘the ability of
noradrenaline,  xxxd2584xxx  and tyramine to increase efflux
is in keeping with an accelerative exchange diffusion
process’’. the idea that the cotransport of sodium with a
substrate, which would increase the affinity for substrate for
the inward face, could favor reverse transport was suggested
by sammet and graefe (1979). thus, all of the ingredients
for an amph facilitated exchange diffusion mechanism
were in place by 1979.
it has not, however, been an easy task to prove the
existence of classical facilitated exchange diffusion driven
by amph. first, some of the presumed requirements for this
model, such as the ability to saturate transport, temperature
dependence, inhibition by uptake blockers, sensitivity to
structural modification or stereospecificity, could equally
well apply to other modes of release via the transporter that
do not require a mobile carrier to traverse the membrane (in
the case of the standard version of the model) or to have a
binding site(s) with alternating access to either side (a more
common version of the model at the present time); moreover,

these same properties could be consistent with release by a
channel-like mode.
one prediction that might specifically endorse facilitated
exchange diffusion is that for compounds that elicit release via
exchange, those that are better substrates for uptake should
also be better releasers, i.e., a linear regression between the
two properties. the first study we are aware of designed to test
paton’s theory of facilitated exchange diffusion as a means of
amph action was by charles rutledge and coworkers
(arnold et al., 1977), in which they showed that the s(+)amph was a more potent releaser of dopamine and
norepinephrine from chopped cortical brain tissue than its
stereoisomer. they wrote that the temperature dependence
and stereospecificity of amph-mediated release ‘‘suggest
that a carrier-mediated, facilitated diffusion is involved in
amphetamine-induced transport of norepinephrine and
dopamine.’’
a more specific prediction of a linear relationship
between uptake and release was tested by j.k. fischer and
arthur cho (1979), who reported a nearly linear relationship
between the inhibition of dopamine uptake and release for
both amph optical isomers, and three other sympathomimetics. for instance, s(+)-amph was about 3-fold more
efficacious than the r()-isomer at both uptake and release.
they concluded that while amph enhances cytoplasmic
dopamine levels by ‘‘stimulation of granular release,’’ i.e.,
redistribution of vesicular dopamine, and by mao inhibition, there was no release of dopamine unless amph was
taken up the transporter.
in contrast, a follow-up study by u. trendelenburg and
collaborators showed a non-linear relationship between
uptake and release of various amph-like compounds
(langeloh et al., 1987). they compared the effects of a
variety of sympathomimetics using rat vas deferens, tubes that
transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts
and are surrounded by smooth muscle innervated by
norepinephrinergic terminals. they did not confirm the
predicted straightforward relationship between uptake and
release reported by fischer and cho, but rather that some
compounds, including amph, were substantially better
releasers than substrates for uptake. the curve of release
versus uptake was related to uptake to the 4th power, and they
used that relationship to surmise that there might be four
different contributors to efflux. they suggested that these
were (in the absence of vesicular stores and mao activity,
which were pharmacologically blocked in that study): (1)
facilitated exchange diffusion, (2) cotransport of sodium that
would increase the affinity of catecholamines to the inward
facing binding site, (3) cotransport of chloride, which would
also increase affinity, and (4) competitive inhibition of
catecholamine reuptake.
a study by sarah jones et al. (1999) to test facilitated
exchange diffusion in the striatum found that dopamine
displacement from vesicles by  xxxd1639xxx -1248 and reserpine-like
compounds, which would be expected to increase cytosolic
dopamine levels, did not cause dopamine efflux. this was

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

interpreted to mean that simply increasing the intracellular
dopamine concentration was not enough to cause dopamine
efflux and that actual uptake of amph by dat was essential.
later results, however, contradicted the assumption that
reserpine elevates cytosolic dopamine levels (mosharov et al.,
2003), as cytosolic catecholamines were rapidly metabolized
by mao to dopac and similar derivatives that are not dat
substrates (section 6.1). note also that a requirement of
amph to elicit reverse transport can be consistent with a gated
channel-like model.
an electrochemical study of norepinephrine reverse
transport in transfected cells by nianhang chen and
joseph justice (1998) used tyramine and cocaine to test
predictions of facilitated exchange diffusion. after
allowing the cells to accumulate dopamine and then
challenging them with tyramine, they found that more
tyramine was taken up than dopamine released. as they
increased dopamine accumulation, tyramine-induced
dopamine release became comparatively more efficient
(but still less than one-for-one exchange). the authors
concluded that ‘‘theoretically, with the intracellular
dopamine approaching infinitely high concentration, the
efflux rate of internal dopamine would equal the uptake
rate of external m-tyramine,’’ which would be consistent
with facilitated exchange diffusion.
there are, however, conflicting results in the tradition of
the langeloh study indicating that uptake and release can be
uncoupled. in the case of dat, applying zinc (10 mm) to
dat-transfected cells stimulates efflux of intracellular
[3h]dopamine despite its concomitant inhibition of substrate
uptake (scholze et al., 2002; meinild et al., 2004). this
dissociation contravenes the expectation that efflux velocity
principally depends on the rate of outward-to-inward facing
binding sites. recent efforts to produce concatemers of
sert and gaba transporters suggest that the quaternary
arrangement of the proteins may regulate amph driven
reverse transport (seidel et al., 2005).
despite the difficulty in proving classical facilitated
exchange diffusion, there is also little reason to state that it
does not occur. there are, nevertheless, instances of
amph-driven reverse transport that facilitated exchange
diffusion cannot explain. for instance, amph injected
directly into giant dopamine neurons of the planorbis
corneus pond snail induces reverse transport of dopamine
(sulzer et al., 1995), although in that case, the amph was
never transported by dat. similarly, membranophilic weak
bases that are not dat substrates, such as chloroquine and
methylamine, collapse synaptic vesicle ph gradients and
induce reverse transport that is halted by dat blockers
(sulzer et al., 1993). moreover, simply increasing
intracellular sodium can drive dopamine efflux in the
absence of extracellular amph (khoshbouei et al., 2003),
and release of synaptosomal dopamine in na+-free medium
or after inhibition na+/k+ exchange by ouabain is well
established (raiteri et al., 1979). each of these examples
points out that classical facilitated exchange diffusion

423

cannot be sufficient to explain all of the release of
catecholamines by amph.
5.5.2. channel-like transporter modes
direct evidence for channel-like release events mediated
by amph is recent, as very rapid recording technology is
required to observe such events. in the initial reports, patch
clamp recordings of cell lines expressing catecholamine
transporters displayed transient very large events that
appeared to indicate ion channel-like mode of conduction
of catecholamine (galli et al., 1996, 1998). such events
resemble uncoupled ion conductances similar to those
recorded in classical ion channels. these uncoupled ion
conductances have been associated with dat (sonders
et al., 1997), serotonin transporter (sert) (mager et al.,
1994) and glutamate transporters (wadiche et al., 1995; otis
and jahr, 1998).
the existence of ion-channel like conductions of
catecholamines themselves was confirmed by simultaneously measuring both large current and catecholamine
release events by combining patch-clamp with amperometric recordings, which demonstrated that the channel-like
activity of the net transporter was temporally associated
with transmitter flux (galli et al., 1998). the authors thus
concluded that the transmitter can cross the cell membrane
through an aqueous net pore.
amph-triggered channel-like dopamine release events
mediated by dat were recently recorded from cultures of
both midbrain dopamine neurons and a dat-transfected
cell line (kahlig et al., 2005). the channel-like events were
surprisingly large, consisting of 10,000 molecules
released over at most a few milliseconds, startlingly similar
to quantal release events measured from synaptic vesicle
exocytosis from axons of the same neurons (pothos et al.,
1998; staal et al., 2004); unlike quantal events, however,
amph-triggered events were completely blocked by
cocaine.
using simultaneous patch-clamp and amperometric
recordings as they had for net, the investigators confirmed
that amph-mediated reverse transport at dat required the
presence of intracellular sodium, but found that the number
of released dopamine molecules per ion transported was far
higher during the brief episodes of channel-like release than
the much slower, lower level of release assumed to be due to
exchange diffusion. they estimated that about 10% of
amph-mediated dopamine released was due to the
channel-like events; although due to the difficulty in
measuring slow release with amperometry (schmitz et al.,
2001), the genuine contribution by channel-like events may
be higher. more strikingly, extracellular amph increased
the frequency of channel-like release events by 8-fold,
while extracellular dopamine had no effect on the frequency
of the channel-like events. these results suggest an
unexpected very different response by dat to amph or
dopamine, the basis of which is entirely unknown, although
the authors speculate that it may have to do with additional

424

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

proteins associated with dat that are regulated selectively
by the neurotransmitter.
5.5.3. a grand unified theory? a role for second
messengers?
as above, stein’s introduction of a facilitated exchange
diffusion model underlying reverse transport already had a
role for transmembrane gradients. under most circumstances, its adaptation by paton, sammet and graefe, and
fischer and cho as an exchange mechanism of amph for
cytosolic catecholamine via increasing outward-to-inward
facing conformations is consistent with amph action, so
long as a sufficient pool of cytosolic substrate is available.
nevertheless, the ability of amph, membranophilic weak
bases, na+, or zn2+ to release transmitter even when not
taken up by dat, as well as the recent demonstration of the
existence of amph-induced channel-like release events
mediated by dat that release very large quantities of
substrates via reverse flow through the transporter, indicates
that a more detailed explanation of the structural changes
that occur during reverse transport and its regulation by the
various transmembrane gradients is required.
an important aspect may be due to amph’s ability to
stimulate the cotransport of ions, as originally suggested by
thonen’s study (thoenen et al., 1969), and the consequent
rearrangement of electrochemical gradients (sitte et al.,
1998; khoshbouei et al., 2003). the recent finding that
amph’s increase of intracellular sodium concentration may
be sufficient to stimulate amph-induced dat-mediated
dopamine efflux (khoshbouei et al., 2003) supports the
notion that this action is essential for its stimulation of
dopamine efflux (pifl and singer, 1999; pifl et al., 2004).
how might this work at the level of transporter structure?
a ‘‘unified’’ model that encompasses roles for both substrate
and ion gradients, as well as channel-like properties in which
multiple substrates could be transported without a shuttling
binding site, could be consistent with reports of the structure
of the first secondary active transporters to be crystallized,
the plasma membrane e. coli bacterial lactose permease and
glycerol-3-phosphatase transporters (abramson et al., 2003;
huang et al., 2003) as well as a putative prokaryotic
glutamate transporter from the thermophilic archaean
pyrococcus horikoshii (yernool et al., 2004); unfortunately,
only a single conformation is currently available for each
transporter, and so these hypotheses are quite conjectural.
these first two structures were suggested to be consistent
with a rocker-switch alternating access model, in which
tilting of transporter domains would close a ‘‘cavity’’ on the
cytoplasmic side (the inward-facing conformation) to
thereby open a new ‘‘cavity’’ on the extracellular (or for
bacteria, periplasmic) side (the outward-facing conformation) (huang et al., 2003; locher et al., 2003). the structure
of the putative glutamate transporter (yernool et al., 2004)
suggested an alternate model in which coordinated ‘‘flipper’’
movements of two sets of two hairpin loops might allow
alternating access by occluding the transporter, perhaps in a

series of three conformations. as pointed out in a short
review (kavanaugh, 2004), this differs from the rockerswitch model in that it provides an ‘‘open state’’ on either
side of the membrane without an ‘‘open channel’’.
both models would provide variations on the classical
facilitated exchange diffusion, but without the requirement
for a binding site that traverses the membrane, and so they
can seemingly provide for channel-like events. there would
then be no limit of a one-for-one molecule exchange of
cytosolic substrate in reverse transport. rather, reverse
transport may follow electrochemical/ionic/substrate gradients that act to lower the energy barrier for favorable
conformations that favor translocation. if in the case of
amph reverse transport, this would be provided by amph
acting as a substrate itself or its accompanying cotransported
ion(s). this would be neither classical facilitated exchange
diffusion with a one-to-one molecule limit nor a channel that
simply follows a substrate gradient once it has been opened,
but rather a gating mechanism that exhibits aspects of both
classical hypotheses.
new work (khoshbouei et al., 2004) seems consistent
with such a unified model, invoking an asymmetric
transporter that suggests a conformational property of
dat that typically favors influx over efflux, but with net flux
controlled by transmembrane substrate gradients, and also
introduces a potential second messenger system that may
provide the basis for these observations. evidence for an
asymmetric conformation of the transporter is that when the
first 22 amino acids of the n-terminal region of dat were
truncated or if serine residues in that region were mutated to
alanine (which cannot be phosphorylated), amph-mediated
dopamine efflux was selectively reduced by 80%. as
mutating the same serine residues to aspartate in order to
simulate serine phosphorylation resulted in normal amphmediated efflux, the authors suggested that phosphorylation
of some serines may shift dat from a ‘‘reluctant’’ state to a
‘‘willing’’ state that favors amph-induced dopamine efflux,
without affecting normal dopamine uptake.
consistent with a regulation of transport direction by
second messenger systems, numerous putative phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases were identified in the
intracellular domains of the dat (giros et al., 1996; grånäs
et al., 2003). in addition, multiple protein kinases have been
shown to regulate dat function (melikian and buckley,
1999; carvelli et al., 2002; grånäs et al., 2003; loder and
melikian, 2003). interestingly, amph has been shown to
increase striatal particulate protein kinase c (pkc) activity
(giambalvo, 1992). accordingly, pkc activation has been
shown to stimulate dat-mediated release of dopamine
(giambalvo, 1992; kantor and gnegy, 1998), and amphmediated da release is inhibited by pkc inhibitors and by
downregulation of pkc (kantor and gnegy, 1998), whereas
[3h]da uptake is unaffected by these manipulations.
moreover, phosphorylation of net by protein kinase c is
reported to be required for amph-mediated efflux (kantor
et al., 2001).

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

it may be that the combination of amph and
phosphorylation produces a dat conformation that favors
dopamine efflux. this would also be a new non-classical
variant of facilitated exchange diffusion (if one could still
call it that), as there would no longer be a requirement of a
one-for-one exchange of dopamine and amph molecules. it
may be that some such dat states underlie the channel-like
release events.
in summary, despite very strong confirmation of the
notion that amph elicits reverse transport, there are many
unanswered questions on how it does so. how do changes in
ion and substrate concentrations and gradients affect
facilitated exchange diffusion or channel-like properties?
how important is the putative channel-like mode for the
efflux of neurotransmitter, and why is it selectively activated
by amph but not dopamine? how do second messenger
systems and associated proteins alter these states? what are
the relevant structural conformations, and are the neurotransmitter and ion substrate binding and translocation sites
identical on the cytosolic and extracellular sides? while the
classical transport models have contributed important ideas,
is it time to develop new names for the revised models that
avoid confusing semantic traps? or, as in friedrich
nietchze’s version of the wisdom of zarathustra, shall we
researchers ‘‘muddy their water that it may seem deep’’?

6. other mechanisms that affect extracellular
catecholamine levels
there are many other properties of amph that contribute
to drug effects, but we have attempted to limit this review to
those that affect extracellular catecholamines. here we
review additional mechanisms that may be important in
regulating extracellular catecholamines, in particular for
amph and meth. for some mechanisms, such as mao
inhibition, the effects are clearly germane, while for others a
genuine role is yet to be elucidated.
6.1. amphetamines as  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors
a means by which amphetamines can influence neurotransmitter release apart from effects on plasma membrane
and vesicular transporters is to increase the quantity of
biogenic amine available for release by inhibiting maos —
key mediators of amine catabolism located on the outer
mitochondrial membrane. amph derivatives are competitive
inhibitors of these enzymes, and recognition of this fact far
predates the isolation of the enzymes. hermann blaschko
et al. (1937) used a range of substrates and inhibitors to
characterize amine oxidizing activities in various tissue,
animal, and plant preparations. they demonstrated that many
isopropylamines, including amph and ephedrine, are not
themselves subject to degradation by the enzyme preparations
but can nevertheless block the consumption of oxygen
otherwise used to oxidize substrates including epinephrine

425

and tyramine. it is worth noting merton sandler’s opinion that
these studies of amine oxidation by blaschko ‘‘were probably
responsible for triggering off the psychopharmacology
revolution’’ (sandler, 2004) as they presaged the introduction
of mao inhibitors for treatment of depression: such use of the
drugs was initiated in the early 1950s after mood elevation
was noted following administration of iproniazid to
tuberculosis patients.
mann and quastel (1940) reported an analogous finding
on mao inhibition motivated by an entirely different
rationale. amph has long been used for treating narcolepsy
(section 2.3). the authors were interested in testing a
hypothesis that narcolepsy resulted from amine-induced
inhibition of brain metabolism by determining whether
amph prevented a gradual decline in respiration observed
in tissue treated with amine oxidase substrates such as
tyramine. their findings suggested that aldehydes formed by
amine oxidation depressed respiration and that amph
inhibited their formation, albeit with modest potency.
in 1971, leitz and stefano published a study of
norepinephrine metabolism and release in which they drew
the bold conclusion that the principal actions of amph,
tyramine, and  xxxd2584xxx  on neurotransmitter release is
mediated through mao inhibition. using perfused rat hearts
preloaded with [3h]norepinephrine, they observed that
amph and tyramine increased [3h]norepinephrine and
concomitantly decreased its tritiated deaminated metabolites in the perfusate. to bolster their argument, the authors
also showed that tranylcypromine (18), an irreversible mao
inhibitor which is an amph analog, had effects comparable
to those of amph on releasing tritiated species. these
results, however, were likely the conflated outcome of at
least three distinct mechanisms: (1) effects on mao activity;
(2) efflux through plasma membrane net; and (3) the efflux
of the acidic and glycol metabolites. furthermore, tranylcypromine is a substrate of the plasma membrane
transporters and therefore could promote efflux, while the
timescale tested may have been too short to observe
irreversible effects of tranylcypromine on mao. rutledge
(1970) made a concerted attempt to disentangle such factors
using rabbit brain slices and synaptosomal preparations and
reached a different conclusion: that amph prevents
deamination most potently by acting at plasma membrane
transporters to block reuptake and facilitate efflux of amines
from the cytoplasm which thus escape mao, although
amph additionally acts to directly inhibit mao.
the development of relatively specific irreversible
inhibitors for mao a ( xxxd1730xxx ) and b (deprenyl) (13)
subtypes in the 1960s (knoll et al., 1965; johnston, 1968;
knoll and magyar, 1972) facilitated the study of inhibitor
selectivity. amph and many of its analogs show 5-fold or
greater selectivity for mao a over mao b (mantle et al.,
1976; robinson, 1985; scorza et al., 1997), and most behave
as reversible and competitive non-substrate inhibitors. the
affinity of amph for mao a is typically in the range of
10 mm for the s(+)-enantiomer, a few fold higher in affinity

426

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

than its optical antipode (mantle et al., 1976; robinson,
1985). thus, the stereoselectivity of mao a for s(+)-amph
is similar to those of dat and  xxxg2099xxx . meth, which shows
comparable affinity and stereoselectivity to amph at the
plasma membrane transporters, in contrast, displays about
five-fold lower affinity (100 mm) than ( )-amph for
mao a and essentially no stereoselectivity (robinson,
1985). the affinities of amph and meth for maos
compare unfavorably with their potency at net and dat,
which are usually reported in the 100–200 nm range
(references in sections 5.1 and 5.2).
considering the poor affinity and stereoselectivity of
mao b for amph and meth, it is curious that the
prototypic substrate for mao b is  xxxd2901xxx , which
differs from amph only in lacking the a-methyl group, and
that the first and still widely-used irreversible selective mao
b inhibitor is ()-deprenyl, an n-2-propynyl analog of
meth. [note that deprenyl is metabolized to amph and
meth (reynolds et al., 1978).] amph-like structures have
served as a useful scaffold for the development of much
more potent competitive and irreversible inhibitors including amiflamine (ask et al., 1989) (19), 4-methoxy-amph
(pma) (20), 4-methylthio-amph (scorza et al., 1997) (21),
pheniprazine (22), and tranylcypromine (18).
in summary, while there is a relatively low potency of
amph at mao, one cannot discount a contribution from
mao inhibition to its spectrum of physiological activity.
notably, while neither reserpine nor mao inhibitors alone
increase cytosolic dopamine, intracellular patch electrochemistry shows that the combination of the two causes a
profound increase similar to that of amph itself (mosharov
et al., 2003). as amph is a substrate of the plasma membrane
transporters, it could be concentrated in the cytoplasm to a
level that inhibits maos on the outer mitochondrial
membranes. numerous factors already mentioned make it
difficult to determine the cytoplasmic amph concentrations
attained after physiological doses of the drug, including the
ability of amph to lipophilically diffuse across membranes
and its uptake into vesicles by  xxxg2099xxx  and due to its
accumulation as a weak base in acidic compartments.
finally, although little data is available, a major metabolite
of amph (cho and kumagai, 1994) 4-oh-amph (amethyl-p-tyramine) (23) is likely to serve as a competitive
inhibitor of mao a. as a substrate of the plasma membrane
transporters (cho et al., 1975, 1977) with lower membrane
permeability than amph, the 4-oh-amph metabolite might
be more likely than amph to reach high levels in the
cytoplasm to serve as an effective mao inhibitor.
6.2. promotion of dopamine synthesis
amph has long been noted to enhance dopamine
synthesis, and this provides an important role in its action
under some conditions, e.g., following reserpine treatment
(section 3.2). this effect can be so profound, as measured in
dopamine neuronal culture, that amph releases far more

dopamine in the culture medium than was initially present in
the entire culture prior to amph exposure (larsen et al.,
2002).
there were initial indications that amph enhanced
dopamine synthesis in in vivo experiments (costa et al.,
1972), but a confirmation that this was due to tyrosine
hydroxylase activity awaited measurement of the conversion
of radiolabeled tyrosine to dopamine in rat striatal
synaptosomes (kuczenski, 1975), where amph at concentrations up to 15 mm enhanced dopamine synthesis by as
much as 70%, while higher levels sharply decreased
conversion, reaching control levels of activity at
500 mm. this enhancement of  xxxg2276xxx 
requires extracellular calcium (fung and uretsky, 1982).
the mechanism by which amph enhances tyrosine
hydroxylase activity is unknown. while calcium-dependent
second messenger phosphorylation of serine residues on
 xxxg2276xxx  can regulate enzymatic activity
(griffiths and marley, 2001), the relationship to amph
remains obscure. an alternate possibility is that amph may
substitute for dopamine at its  xxxg2276xxx -binding
site from where it exerts feedback inhibition (goldstein and
greene, 1987; haycock, 1993). similarly the mechanism of
amph’s  xxxg2276xxx  inhibition at higher levels
remains unknown, although it has long been suggested to be
due to feedback inhibition from increased levels of cytosolic
dopamine (harris et al., 1975) (section 6.1).
6.3. effects on dat and  xxxg2099xxx  trafficking
this hypothesis that amph acutely regulates dat cell
surface expression originated from a study by annette
fleckenstein and coworkers in which a single, high dose of
amph administered to rats decreased dat function 1 h
later (fleckenstein et al., 1997). further work confirmed that
dopamine regulates transporter cell surface expression. for
example, in xenopus laevis oocytes expressing dat,
application of dopamine reduced dat cell surface expression as measured by binding by the dat ligand [3h]win
35,428 (gulley et al., 2002) and similar dopamine regulation
of dat membrane expression was observed in rat striatal
synaptosomes (chi and reith, 2003).
like dopamine, amph acutely reduced cell surface
expression of human dat (hdat) in cell lines, leading to a
concomitant loss of dat activity (saunders et al., 2000).
kahlig et al. (2004) using confocal imaging and electrophysiology, demonstrated that amph application causes
hdat to redistribute from the plasma membrane as an active
carrier. sorkina et al. (2003) extended these observations by
showing that amph-induced intracellular accumulation of
hdat on endosomal vesicles.
in addition to mediating hdat cell surface redistribution,
amph and its derivatives appear to regulate vmat2
function. in particular, a single meth injection rapidly (1 h)
and reversibly decreased dopamine uptake in a vesicleenriched fraction obtained from rat striatum (brown et al.,

d. sulzer et al. / progress in neurobiology 75 (2005) 406–433

2000, 2002) [for review, see fleckenstein and hanson,
2003]. the meth action was likely largely associated with
the dopaminergic system, as the destruction of the
serotonergic projections did not alter the effects on vesicular
dopamine uptake. it is possible that the response to amph is
indirect and that the apparent inhibition of vmat2 is due to
d2 autoreceptor activation following dopamine release
(brown et al., 2002). if vmat2 is indeed redistributed to
endosomes or other compartments, it will be important to
determine the signaling and mechanics involved.
6.4. trace amine receptors and other potential
receptors for amph
as discussed, there has long been speculation that
endogenous amph-like biogenic amines, prominently
including  xxxd2901xxx , act as endogenous amphetamines (section 2.2). there has been a resurgence in interest
in this topic due to the discovery of a family of 15
mammalian g protein-coupled trace amine receptors
(borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001). the rat trace
amine receptor, rtar1, which has been the most thoroughly
characterized of these receptors (bunzow et al., 2001), acts
to stimulate camp production; additional downstream
second messenger responses are likely to be involved.
little is now known about the physiological actions of these
receptors, and there is as yet no data indicating that they are
involved in amph’s role in enhancing extracellular
catecholamines.
rtar1 is activated by a broad array of amines, including
 xxxd2901xxx  and tyramine. amph and meth are
both potent activators, with nearly identical responses to
both isomers. mdma and hydroxylated amph derivatives
are likewise effective, while fenfluramine has no action.
interestingly, the meta-o-methyl derivatives of the catecholamines, namely 3-methoxytyramine, normetanephrine,
and metanephrine, are more efficacious activators of rtar1
than their respective precursors dopamine, ne, and
epinephrine.
there are other receptors that may be activated by
amph. amph binds to a-2 adrenergic receptors (ritz and
kuhar, 1989), and while these are presynaptic receptors, we
are unaware of a demonstration that they are located on
dopamine terminals. it is nevertheless possible that this
action underlies effects of amph on anxiety and other
effects of central norepinephrine neurons, where the
presynaptic receptor is found, and it is interesting that the
anxiogenic and psychotomimetic drug yohimbine (from the
west african tree corynanthe yohimbe), is an a-2 blocker.
it should be noted that some amph analogs, prominently
including ‘‘hallucinogenic’’ derivatives directly activate
serotonin receptors and moreover that some are more
specific for sert than dat (e.g., fenfluramine). many
derivatives have been developed by medicinal chemists
through extensive studies on structure–function relationships and are beyond the scope of this review, but are

427

discussed in excellent reviews by others (nichols, 1994;
schmidt, 1994).
one study claims that amph releases catecholamines by
activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (liu et al.,
2003), primarily based on measuring ca2+ transients in
chromaffin cells (see also section 6.6). in apparent contrast,
single channel electrophysiological studies indicate that
amph (spitzmaul et al., 1999) and ephedrine (bouzat,
1996) act as nicotinic receptor channel blockers. it will be
interesting to see how this issue develops and whether there
is any pharmacological significance.
6.5. depolarization at the dat
as detailed above (section 6.4), catecholamine transporters transport na+ and cl ions. susan ingram et al.
(2002) reported that dat activation by amph can induce
sufficient excitatory current to potentiate neuronal firing.
surprisingly, this excitation follows the inward flux of cl,
which normally hyperpolarizes these neurons. if borne out,
the finding could explain reports of amph-induced
neuronal excitation (shi et al., 2000) and exocytic
catecholamine release (pierce and kalivas, 1997; darracq
et al., 2001). it may be that relatively low exposures to
amph stimulate dopamine neuronal firing or enhance the
releasable vesicular pool, although we are not aware of
direct evidence at this time beyond ingram’s study to support
these possibilities. rather, experiments with striatal slices
demonstrate that amph-induced dopamine release inhibits
dopamine release by activating presynaptic terminal d2
autoreceptors (schmitz et al., 2001), and there is a
significant literature on d2 autoreceptor inhibition of firing.
6.6. intracellular calcium triggered via weak base
effects
mark wightman and coworkers reported that rapid
perfusion of amph as well as non-psychostimulant weak
bases induced quantal exocytosis from chromaffin cells via a
weak base action (mundorf et al., 1999), as the accumulation
of intravesicular calcium by chromaffin vesicles can may be
indirectly dependent on h+ gradients (haigh and phillips,
1993). the level of calcium redistributed from the vesicles
by amph may be sufficient to induce vesicular exocytosis,
and this could underlie a portion of amph action in
secretory cells under some conditions. amph has not yet
been observed to induce exocytosis via effects on cytosolic
calcium levels from vesicles in central neurons, and from the
data discussed in sections 2–5, there remains little evidence
suggesting a substantial direct effect on exocytosis in central
acute amph-mediated catecholamine release, although this
has by no means been ruled out. it should, however, be
pointed out that a prominent indirect effect of amph is to
activate presynaptic d2 or adrenergic receptors that inhibit
subsequent evoked vesicular catecholamine release
(schmitz et al., 2001).

7. epilogue
despite the importance of self-administered drugs of
reward and addiction, a thorough understanding of the
mechanisms of action of some, including ethanol and
amph, continues to elude us. perhaps our deepest
impression from perusing over a century of literature on
amph is that while new technologies allow some longstanding hypotheses to be revised, refined, or discarded,
variations on the earliest questions on mechanisms of action
continue to re-arise. we hope that the historical approach we
have adopted here underlines the profound insights gleaned
from relatively restricted experimental tools by the talented
pioneers of this research.
