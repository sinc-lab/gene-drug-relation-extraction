abstract: progesterone is one of the first nuclear receptor hormones to be described functionally
and subsequently approached as a drug target. because progesterone (1) affects both menstruation
and gestation via the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), research aimed at modulating its activity is
usually surrounded by controversy. however, ligands for pr were developed into drugs, and their
evolution can be crudely divided into three periods: (1) drug-like steroids that mimic the gestational
properties of progesterone; (2) drug-like steroids with different properties from progesterone and
expanded therapeutic applications; and (3) non-steroidal pr ligands with improved selectivity and
modulator properties and further expanded therapeutic applications. although the latter have yet to
see widespread clinical applications, their development is founded on a half century of research,
and they represent the future for this drug target. ß 2006 wiley periodicals, inc. med res rev, 27, no. 3,

1. introduction
few research programs generate more controversy than those aimed at altering the effects of the
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) because they potentially involve altering the reproductive habits of our
species. modulating pr activity via synthetic ligands often breeds arguments with religious
overtones and touches on issues such as overpopulation, poverty, and women’s empowerment. while
these issues are worthy of serious discussion, they are beyond the scope of this article, which will
focus on the evolution of synthetic pr ligands and their therapeutic applications. the development of
pr ligands can be divided into three periods: (1) the development of steroid ligands that mimic the
effect of progesterone (1); (2) the development of steroid ligands with expanded properties and
therapeutic applications; and (3) the development of non-steroidal ligands with enhanced properties
leading to still greater therapeutic index and additional applications.

pr has long been an important drug target because of its role in the female reproductive cycle.
progesterone is crucial for the events that lead to fertilization and the establishment of pregnancy, and
it prepares the endometrium for implantation through cell proliferation. when progesterone levels
fall, menstruation and endometrial repair occur.1 serum concentrations of progesterone begin to
increase just prior to the mid-cycle gonadotropin surge that precedes ovulation. increased
progesterone levels in plasma are responsible for the lack of ovulation during pregnancy through
negative feedback to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  release system. this
inhibitory effect of progesterone is the basis for oral contraceptives (ocs), which contain synthetic
progesterone analogs. the term progestin became widely used when referring to this general class
of pr agonists, which includes progesterone and its synthetic analogs.2 likewise, anti-progestin
is the general term for compounds that inhibit the effects of progesterone, such as mifepristone
(ru486).
pr is a member of the steroid/nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  superfamily of transcription factors.
nuclear receptors are multi-domain proteins with functionally independent regions associated with
dna and ligand binding. in the absence of a ligand, pr is associated with a complex of heat shock
proteins in a transcriptionally inactive state. upon binding a ligand, the receptor changes
conformations, disengages from the heat shock proteins,3–6 enters the nucleus, and binds
progesterone response elements in various gene promoters to modulate transcriptional activity.7
progesterone-bound pr activates transcription either by direct interaction with the transcriptional
machinery, or through the recruitment of co-activators, such as steroid receptor co-activator-1,8
which are often regarded as amplifiers of transcriptional regulation.8,9 nuclear receptor co-repressors
have the opposite effect, decreasing transcription when recruited to the gene promoter.10 synthetic
pr ligands have been designed to recruit both co-activators and co-repressors, thereby activating and
inhibiting gene activation.
the development of synthetic  xxxd2554xxx , anti- xxxd2554xxx , and pr modulators, along with the
increasing therapeutic applications for pr ligands, is the focus of the current review. we will start
with the identification and implementation of pr as a drug target for contraception, follow with the
improvement of oral contraceptives and the expanded use and modulation of pr by synthetic steroids
for a wider array of therapies, and take a look at the non-steroidal compounds currently in
development that represent the next wave of pr modulators. finally, the structure and flexibility of
the pr binding pocket in the presence of different  xxxd2554xxx  will be discussed. within the last decade,
molecular biology and crystallography have combined to provide an atomic view of pr/ligand
complexes. these studies have shown that a protein whose primary function is to stringently
recognize a specific small molecule is surprisingly amenable to modulation by a wide variety of small
molecules.

2. the development of steroid oral contraceptives
 xxxg1737xxx  is one of the ‘‘classic’’ members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily
because its biological activity and cognate hormone were discovered before the protein was
identified. in fact, the development of ocs (or ‘‘the pill’’) represents a model success story for
traditional drug discovery methods, which relied heavily on animal models during all stages of
pharmaceutical development and testing. this story also stems from a monumental period in the
medicinal chemistry, when steroid hormone natural products were identified, purified, synthesized,
and improved upon. the significance of the work on steroid biochemistry is recognized by four nobel
prizes in chemistry and two in medicine or physiology between 1927 and 1969.
as with the other classic nuclear receptor hormones, successful identification of progesterone
was initiated by the identification of a specific tissue that contained the pertinent biological activity.

the localization of gestational activity in the corpus luteum (or yellow body) was discovered through
surgical studies which showed that removal of the corpus luteum terminated pregnancy11 and that
extracts from the corpus luteum suppressed ovulation in rats.12 corner and allen showed that
gestational activity in castrated rabbits can be restored by extracts from corpus luteum, up to and
including normal birth.13,14 this observation became a convenient assay to test progestational
activity—the administration of hormone extract to castrated rabbits produced an easily recognized
proliferation of the uterine mucosa. clauberg15 developed a modified assay that eliminated the need
for castration; injection of the hormone extract into infantile rabbits induced endometrial
development. these assays provided a means for identifying and purifying the active ingredient,
so by 1934 several groups announced the purification of crystalline  xxxd3023xxx  from sow
ovaries.16–19 ovaries from 10–15 sows were required to produce enough purified hormone to induce
the characteristic physiological changes in the uterus in a single rabbit. however, this effort produced
sufficient quantities of purified material to permit physical characterization of the compound, which
launched synthetic chemistry efforts to produce the hormone in more useful amounts.

initial attempts at the bulk synthesis of progesterone involved conversion from abundant naturally
occurring steroids. different labs used different materials that were both plentiful and chemically
tractable as synthetic starting points. these included the steroids cholesterol (2) (typically derived from
cow and pig fat), stigmasterol (3) (from soybeans), and diosgenin (4) (found in certain mexican yams).
during these early synthetic efforts,20,21 the observation that 14-iso-17-isoprogesterone (5), the c17
isomer of progesterone, exhibited no gestational activity,22,23 led to the assumption that progestational
activity was limited to compounds with structural features closely related to progesterone.

attempts at bulk synthesis of progesterone were not a purely academic pursuit. the previous
observation that progesterone prevented ovulation12 was noted by haberlandt,24 who conclusively
proved that it could be used for fertility control. these experiments were later reproduced in the
united states, and at the 5th international planned parenthood conference in 1955, gregory pincus
demonstrated that large doses of orally administered progesterone inhibited ovulation in women.25
despite its promise as a contraceptive, the practical use of progesterone was limited by the fact that it
is essentially inactive when administered orally. the desire for a compound with contraceptive
properties and better drug-like properties corresponded with a shift in the synthetic focus to
compounds structurally distinct, but functionally similar, to progesterone.

several breakthroughs from different sources came together for the eventual development of oral
contraceptives. in a 1944 paper, ehrenstein examined the effect of removing the ‘‘angular methyl’’ at
the 19 position of progesterone.26 synthesis resulted in inversion at carbons 17, 14, and perhaps 10
and produced an oily mixture of stereo isomers of 19-nor-progesterone (6). despite the extremely
poor yield (0.07%) and complex mixture of stereo isomers, the material was as effective as
progesterone for contraception in rabbits.27 these surprising results encouraged the synthesis of the
stereo isomer 14-allo-17-iso-progesterone (7).23 although 17-iso-progesterone was known to be
inactive, ehrenstrein’s results made it plausible that inversion of stereo centers at both c14 and c17
could lead to a biologically active compound. unfortunately 14-allo-17-iso-progesterone was
discovered to be completely inactive biologically. therefore, removal of the angular methyl group at
c19 appeared to be the key factor in the high contraceptive activity.
this answer was not as obvious as it might seem in hindsight. birch described the synthesis of
19-nor-testosterone (8),28 which was stereo-chemically identical to testosterone but lacked the c19
angular methyl. however, 19-nor-testosterone was found to have lower biological activity in
 xxxg183xxx  than testosterone29 indicating that removal of the angular methyl does not
guarantee greater biological activity. ultimately, 19-nor-progesterone was synthesized, with all the
correct chiral centers,30 and was found to be four to eight times as potent as the natural hormone31 by
the clauberg assay when given by injection. 19-nor-progesterone was the most potent progestin of
the time; however, it was still ineffective when given orally.

in fact, the modification needed to produce orally active  xxxd2554xxx  had been made 13 years prior
to the 19-nor-progesterone experiments. in 1938, inhoffen had observed that 17a-ethynyl-testosterone
(9) was actually a weakly active progestin when administered orally.32 could the enhancement of
progestational activity conferred by removing the c19 angular methyl from progesterone be applied
to 17a-ethynyl-testosterone? to test this hypothesis, 19-nor-17a-ethynyl-testosterone, or  xxxd2751xxx  (10), was synthesized in 1951 by scientists at syntex.33,34 at just about the same time, synthesis
of the double bond isomer of  xxxd2751xxx , norethynodrel (11), was reported by scientists at
searle.35 the initial animal experiments36,37 indicated that both compounds were orally active
 xxxd2554xxx  with approximately twice the activity of progesterone. the first human experiments were
published less than a year later,38 followed by clinical trials for contraception.39–41 more extensive
clinical trials of a combination of norethynodrel with the estrogen  xxxd2581xxx  (12) were carried out and
the results were presented at a symposium organized by searle at their headquarters.42  xxxd2581xxx 
(17a-ethynyl-estradiol 3-methyl ester) originally surfaced as an impurity in the large scale synthesis
of norethynodrel for these clinical trials. however, the combination of estrogen and progestin caused
less bleeding irregularities than progestin alone, prompting the inclusion of 1.5%  xxxd2581xxx  in later
formulations. the u.s. food and drug administration approved the combination therapy as  xxxd2054xxx 
for menstrual regulation in 1957 and for contraception in 1959.  xxxd2751xxx  was licensed to parkedavis and, under the name  xxxd2751xxx , was also approved for menstrual regulation in 1957 and
contraception in 1962. with the introduction of these two ocs into the marketplace, the era of
 xxxg1737xxx  ligands entered a new phase.

approval of the two ocs ended the first period in the evolution of pr ligands. this period
encompassed the isolation of gestational activity, purification and identification of progesterone,
identification of therapeutic uses for progesterone ligands, and development of pr drugs. other
accounts of this early work on  xxxd2554xxx  emphasize different aspects of the research. fieser’s books
contain a complete and readable summary of synthetic efforts for all steroid hormones.20,21 first hand
accounts of the events leading to these inventions, the intense competition to develop oral
contraceptives, and the twists and turns of research and development are easy reading.43–45 no matter
your belief system, the development of easily administered contraceptives surely represents a
milestone in the relationship between science and our species’ conduct.

combination ocs continue to be the most popular form of reversible birth control to the present day.
17a-ethinyl-estradiol (ee) (13) has been the most commonly used estrogen component, while the
progestin has changed over the decades.46 until 2000, all  xxxd2554xxx  used in ocs fell into two classes.
those structurally related to 19-nor-testosterone were called estranes ( xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2754xxx  (14),
levonorgestrel (15), gestodene (16),  xxxd1849xxx  (17),  xxxd2753xxx  (18), and dienogest (19)), while
those related to 17a- xxxd2303xxx  were called pregnanes ( xxxd2554xxx  (20),
 xxxd2557xxx  (21), chlormadinone (22), and cyproternone (23)).47
as clinical experience with oral contraceptives grew, so did our understanding of observed side
effects. because many of these  xxxd2554xxx  are derived from testosterone, they bind to androgen
receptor (ar) and to the other steroid receptors to a lesser extent. many of the adverse effects
associated with older  xxxd2554xxx  are due in part to this lack of selectivity. commonly reported side
effects associated with oc use—breast tenderness, weight gain, increased blood pressure, decline of
libido, and mood swings—are the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment. all  xxxd2554xxx 
bind to the pr and have the expected progestational effect, but each progestin has a distinctive profile
of activity in the other hormone receptors. the increased blood pressure and weight gain comes from
 xxxg1602xxx  (mr) agonism, the decline of libido comes from ar antagonism, while
the breast tenderness is from  xxxg730xxx  agonism.46 as table i illustrates, successive
generations of ocs were modified to reduce the adverse androgenic effects, and the fourth generation

of  xxxd2554xxx  has been designed with steroid nuclear receptor selectivity in mind. the desire for an
increased therapeutic index and compliance made the goal to have no androgenic (ar), estrogenic
(er) or glucocorticoid (gr) adverse effects.48

even achieving the selectivity of progesterone will not eliminate off-target effects.
progesterone is a high affinity passive antagonist for mr,47,49 a steroid hormone regulated
transcription factor that plays a physiological role in the regulation of water and electrolyte
(primarily sodium and potassium) levels in mammals. although mr effects in the distal nephron of
the kidney and colon are thought to have the largest influence on vascular blood pressure, mr has
been shown to be located in many tissues, including the brain and heart.50,51 a naturally occurring
mr mutation that turns progesterone into an mr agonist points out its role in sodium homeostasis
and blood pressure as well as the regulation in pregnancy.52 a recently developed steroidal
progestin, drosperinone (25), is an analog of the mr antagonist spironolactone (24) that displays a
pharmacologic profile more closely related to that of progesterone. acting as a pr agonist, but mr
and ar antagonist, drosperinone has been shown to bind pr in the uterus and mr in the kidney.53
the affinity of drosperinone for mr is five times that of aldosterone. mr antagonism is one
of drosperinone’s main benefits, as it counteracts ee’s effect of increasing angiotensin synthesis
in the liver, leading to increased levels of the mr agonist aldosterone. because of this mr
antagonism, drosperinone is associated with weight loss, rather than the weight gain normally
associated with estrane ocs.48

4. anti- xxxd2554xxx 

in the early 1980s baulieu, in collaboration with roussel uclaf, investigated compounds that block
gr action. they were inspired by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen (27), which has a core similar to the
known estrogen diethylstilbestrol (26), but blocks the effects of estrogens at the  xxxg730xxx .
tamoxifen has a low affinity for er, but it is hydroxylated derivative,  xxxd91xxx  (28) binds
tightly due to the phenol which mimics the estradiol a-ring. the third phenyl group of tamoxifen
occupies a position near carbon 11 on a steroid scaffold on the b-side of the overall steroid plane. this
proved to be region of great importance in anti-hormone function.54 substitutions at other regions of
the steroid scaffold were also described, but many were inactive. further development led to ru-486
(mifepristone) (29), a derivative of  xxxd2751xxx , that binds to pr with an affinity five times that of
progesterone.55 the affinity of mifepristone for rat thymus gr was three times greater than that of
dexamethasone, but affinity for the rat prostate ar was only 25% of that of testosterone, and there was
no detectable binding to mouse uterine er or rat kidney mr.56 mifepristone is similar in structure to
 xxxd2751xxx , but has a 4-dimethylaminophenyl group at the 11b position and a 1-propynyl chain at
the 17a position instead of an ethynyl group. the pendant group at the 11b position is responsible for
mifepristone’s anti-progestin action, inducing or stabilizing a biologically inactive receptor
conformation.
mifepristone is the classic anti-progestin, blocking the action of progesterone on the uterus and
cervix. when administered during the early stages of pregnancy, this anti-progesterone action results
in termination by disrupting the capillary endothelial cells of the deciduas. as a result the trophoblast
separates from the decidua, secretion of human  xxxd2228xxx  into the maternal circulation
declines and endometrial bleeding results. in addition, mifepristone softens the cervix, facilitating
expulsion of the embryo from the uterus.57
while mifepristone is the best known anti-progestin, onapristone (zk98299) (30) is a pure
progesterone antagonist that was in clinical development. the clinical trials were halted due to liver

toxicity. onapristone has the same pendant group at the c11 position as mifepristone, suggesting that
it induces a similar conformational change in the receptor. however, the substituents around the c17
position are different, and the stereochemistry of c18 is opposite that of progesterone and
mifepristone. unlike mifepristone, onapristone is devoid of a progestagenic activity in all models.58
it is unknown how the changes around c17 and c18 mediate these functional consequences.

5. steroidal  xxxg1737xxx  modulators

 xxxd2554xxx  and anti- xxxd2554xxx  occupy opposite ends of the pr transcriptional activity spectrum. in
between lay the selective  xxxg1737xxx  modulators (sprms). these are ligands that cause
less transcriptional activation than  xxxd2554xxx  and less transcriptional repression than the antiprogestin, and exhibit partial agonist/antagonist and tissue selective effects in animals and humans.
because sprms have the potential to provide the beneficial effects of  xxxd2554xxx  and anti- xxxd2554xxx 
while avoiding the adverse side effects, this class of ligands is receiving significant attention for
pharmaceutical development. the potential of sprms to provide an expanded therapeutic index may
result in an expansion of pr mediated remedies.
asoprisnil (31) is an 11b-benzaldoxime-substituted steroidal sprm that was in late stages of
clinical development until early 2006 (tap pharmaceutical) for the treatment of uterine fibroids and
endometriosis.59 asoprisnil has a threefold greater binding affinity for pr than progesterone, a
reduced binding affinity for gr compared to dexamethasone (with minimal transcriptional
repression in vivo), a low affinity for ar, and no affinity for er or mr.60 asoprisnil has a large
pendant group off of c11, like mifepristone, but the pendant terminates with a polar oxime instead of
the more hydrophobic dimethyl amine. it is likely that any conformational changes induced by
mifepristone are also induced by asoprisnil, but that the effects are mediated by this polar substituent.
the partial agonist effects of asoprisnil are clearly evident in the rabbit uterine epithelium
(mcphail test) and in the guinea pig uterus and vagina. while the anti-progestin mifepristone showed
no agonist activity in the rabbit uterus, asoprisnil showed agonist activity at doses under 0.03 mg.
however, the agonist effects of asoprisnil in the rabbit uterus never reached the level of epithelial
stimulation induced by progesterone. in guinea pigs, asoprisnil induced the protestagenic responses
of vaginal mucification, and reduced uterine weights in both intact and ovariectomized animals. in the
rabbit model, asoprisnil also showed partial antagonist effects in the presence of progesterone, but the
antagonist effects were weaker than those of mifepristone. importantly, the dose-response curve of
asoprisnil reached a plateau approximately 0.3 mg, that is, there was no further increase in antiprogestagenic activity at higher doses. these data suggest that at saturating doses, asoprisnil has both
anti-progestagenic and agonist activity.61
the unique pharmacological profile of asoprisnil appeared promising for various therapeutic
indications in gynecology, including treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. asoprisnil

clearly differed from anti- xxxd2554xxx  or  xxxd2554xxx  as evidenced by the results of studies in pregnancy
and parturition models and endometrial effects in various animal models. studies in non-human
primates indicated that asoprisnil had the potential to suppress endometrial proliferation and induce
amenorrhea by targeting the endometrium. these effects occurred in the presence of follicular-phase
estrogen concentrations.62 asoprisnil clinical trials in humans were halted in early 2006, at the time
of this review the final reports had not been released.
6. non-steroidal pr ligands
winneker and colleagues63 have provided an excellent review of non-steroidal  xxxg1737xxx 
modulators covering many of the chemical scaffolds reported in the literature. zhang et al. have also
written an excellent review on these types of compounds.64 in the following sections, we highlight
each of the chemical classes of non-steroidal pr modulators, summarize the structure–activity
relationships (sars) around them, and review in vitro and in vivo activities.
a. 6-aryl-1,4-dihydro-2h-benzo[d][1,3]oxazines

pr antagonist activity has been demonstrated in many compounds encompassing 6-aryl
dihydroquinolines such as 32.65 zhang et al.66 replaced the dihydroquinoline scaffold with a
benzoxazine core to provide novel 6-aryl-1,4-dihydro-2h-benzo[d][1,3]oxazines as pr ligands. as a
result, the 6-arylbenzoxazines, such as 33, showed potent pr agonism.66 sar investigation around
this scaffold indicated that the 2-position controlled the functional activity of these compounds.
generally, pr agonist activity was modulated by the substitution of small alkyl groups at the 2position. larger 2-substituents produced compounds with weak antagonism.67 the benzoxazine
illustrated in structure 33 had an ec50 value of 0.35 nm in a human t47d cell line alkaline
phosphatase assay, compared to an ec50 of 0.92 nm for progesterone.66  xxxd3171xxx  had a high pr
affinity with an ic50 of 11.5 nm in a competition-binding assay using the cytosol from human t47d
breast carcinoma cell line.67,68 when tested in a rat decidualization assay by subcutaneous
injection,69 this compound had an ed50 of 1.50 mg/kg and was more than three times as potent as
progesterone (ed50 of 5.62 mg/kg).
b. 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]-oxazine-2-thiones

384

madauss, stewart, and williams

zhang et al.70 further examined the effect of various structural moieties at the 2-position of the
benzoxazine compound, given its tendency to modulate functional activity. potent pr agonists were
discovered by substituting the 2-alkyl group with a thiocarbonyl group providing 6-arylbenzoxazine2-thiones such as 34 and 35. these compounds had greater pr agonist potency than progesterone
with an ec50 of 0.4 to 0.6 nm in the t47d functional assay. the 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazine-2-thiones were evaluated in the ovariectomized female rat decidualization model, delivered
by either subcutaneous injection or oral administration, and were more potent in vivo than
progesterone. a preliminary sar study of the 6-arylbenzoxazine-2-thiones showed that pr agonist
activity was limited by the size of the 3 0 - and 5 0 -substituents on the 6-aryl group.70 substituents larger
than chloro or cyano led to a decrease in pr antagonism. pr agonist activity and potency was
significantly reduced by halogen substitution in the 8-position. methylation of the ring nitrogen
changed the functional activity of the compounds to weak pr antagonism.
c. 5-aryl-3,4-dihydroindole-2-thiones

with a scaffold similar to that of the 6-arylbenzoxazine-2-thiones, 5-aryl-3,4-dihydroindole-2thiones were also shown to be pr agonists. compounds such as 36–38 showed significant potency in
the t47d alkaline phosphatase assay with ec50 values in the range of 0.36 to 2.0 nm.71 the in vitro
and oral potency in the rat decidualization assay was improved by a 5 0 -fluorine substituent as in 37,
providing a fourfold increase in potency in vivo with an ed50 of 0.1 mg/kg, po. this compound had
the same potency as medroxy progesterone acetate ( xxxd2554xxx , see previous section for structure) in the rat
 xxxg282xxx  assay with an ed50 of 0.025 mg/kg, po. the cyano-thiophene derivative 38 was
extremely efficacious in these in vivo models with potencies equal to those of 37.
d. 5-aryl-3,3-disubstituted indolines and cyanopyrroles

 xxxg1737xxx  ligands

385

the sar of a class of pyrrole-containing pr modulators was recently revealed by wyeth,72 and
was found to be sensitive to the chemistry of its substituents. the 2 0 ,5 0 -nitropyrrole 39 was reported
to be an antagonist in the t47d assay with a potency of 180 nm. by exchanging the nitro to a cyano
group such as 40, the functional activity of these compounds could be switched from antagonist to
agonist with an improvement in potency (ec50 of 1.1 nm).72 the 5-pyrrolo-indolones showed similar
characteristics: where the nitro-indolone 42 was an antagonist with an ic50 of 36 nm; the cyanoindolone 43 was an agonist with an ec50 of 2.8 nm.72 a cyano-substituted heterocycle such as 44 was
discovered to be important for agonist activity. although the imidazole analog of compound 40 (44)
had reduced agonist activity, with an ec50 of 130 nm, the pyrrole 45 was an antagonist with ic50 of
41 nm.72 however, upon conversion of the carbonyl group in 40 to a thiocarbonyl as in 41, the
functional activity of the compound was converted to a full agonist.73 because this compound had a
t1/2 of 60 min, 31% bioavailability at 1 mg/kg, and an ec50 of 0.5 mg/kg po in rat models, it has been
moved forward into the clinic under the name  xxxd3286xxx .73 the compound also showed tissue
dependence, exhibiting its maximum potency in the uterus and low potency in the vagina.73 as a
result,  xxxd3286xxx  moved into phase i trials for hormone replacement therapy and phase ii for
contraception. recently, a crystal structure of  xxxd3286xxx  in complex with the pr ligand binding
domain has been solved.74 in early 2006 tanoproget was pulled from all clinical trials due to
breakthrough bleeding.
e. 1,2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinolines

*

madauss, stewart, and williams

the 1,2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinolines such as 46 have been extensively studied by ligand
pharmaceuticals. they found that by including a benzylidene moiety at the 5-position of the ring
system as in 47, potent pr agonist activity could be achieved.75 compound 47 was active in the pr/pre
cotransfection assay in cv1 cells with ec50 of 3.6 nm and showed agonist activity in the t47d assay
with an ec50 of 19 nm. compound 47 also showed comparable efficacy with  xxxd2554xxx  in a rat uterine
epithelial cell height model. however, 47 was demonstrated to have lower efficacy than  xxxd2554xxx  in a
lobulo-alveolar breast epithelium model, using brdu labeling when dosed with estrone, suggesting that
this compound might show tissue selectivity and, thus, modulation. pr agonist activity was also
demonstrated in 5-aryl derivatives of 46 (e.g., 48).76 compound 48 was active on hpr-b with an ec50 of
1.3 nm in cv-1 cells co-transfected with the protein. the compound also had strong binding affinity for
the receptor with a ki of 0.1 nm. compound 48 was reported to have activity similar to that of 47 in the
in vivo rat uterine and mammary models. other derivatives of this series, such as the 5-dithian-2-ylidene
49 and butyl analog 50, were also pr agonists.77,78 compound 49 showed activity in the cv-1 cotransfection assay comparable to the aromatic derivatives 47 and 48 with an ec50 of 2.1 nm. the alkyl
derivative 50, however, was somewhat weaker with an ec50 of 15 nm.
f. tetrahydro-pyridazines

tetrahydro-pyridazine compounds have been reported by ortho.79 the sulfonyl derivative 51 was a
functional agonist in t47d cells and in the modified mcphail assay.80 the compound also exhibited
high affinity for pr derived from rabbit uterus, with an ic50 of 0.02 nm. the functional sar of this
chemotype is very sensitive to substitution. for example, the chlorinated derivative 52 is a pr
antagonist in a human t47d cell proliferation assay.
g. hexahydro-3h-naphtho[2,3-b]furan-2-ones

tabata et al.81,82 described a series of natural products with pr activity. the initial compound was the
secondary metabolite 53, which was isolated from penicillium oblatum. the researchers reported the
isolation of these tricyclic lactones and their affinity in porcine uterine cytosol. in this assay,
compound 53 had an ic50 of 30 nm. the lactam derivative, 54, was found to be a potent pr ligand in
steroid receptor binding assays in the t47d cytosol, with a relative binding affinity of 92% as
compared to progesterone. in vitro pharmacology of this compound in t47d cells showed it to be a
mixed agonist–antagonist. the compound was also found to be an orally active agonist in the
modified mcphail assay.80

h. benzimidazole-2-thiones

a series of benzimidazole-2-thiones were reported as pr agonists by bristol-myers squibb.83
compounds such as 55 in which the r1-position was generally n-linked, contained a 5-membered
ring heterocycle such as imidazole or pyrrole, and the r2-position was a branched or cyclic alkyl
group showed potency and efficacy in a t47d transactiviation and a mmtv reporter assay. as an
example, compound 56 had an ec50 of 3.9 nm and efficacy of 107% and had affinity in a t47d whole
cell binding assay with a ki of 28.6 nm. this compound significantly reduced the e2-induced
increase in epithelial cell height in the endometrium of e2 treated immature rats at doses of 10 and 30
mg/kg subcutaneously by 16% and 25%, respectively.

madauss, stewart, and williams

compound 57, 2,2,4-trimethyl-6-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-quinoline, was identified as a pr antagonist
through screening.84 sar optimization provided compounds such as the 3 0 -cyano-5 0 -fluorophenyl1,2-dihydro-quinoline 58, which also showed antagonist activity in cotransfected cv-1 cells with
an ic50 of 30 nm while its des-fluoro analog did not. although these compounds showed favorable
in vivo efficacy, the apparent hepatomegaly observed in the tested animals caused major concern for
their development.84 similar in vitro hpr-b activity in cv-1 cells was shown by the 1,2dihydrochromenoquinolines (59–60) compared with the parent compounds (57–58).78 among the
most potent 1,2-dihydrochromenoquinolines, 59 had an ic50 of 16.7 nm in co-transfected cv-1 cells,
slightly more potent than its unconstrained analog 58. compound 59 was also orally active in an
ovulation inhibition model in the mature rat.78 recently, the sar of the 5-position was further defined
by preparation of several 5-methylidene-1,2-dihydrochromenoquinolines. although most analogs
were pr agonists, the cyano derivative 60 was shown to have some pr antagonist activity with an ic50
value of 65 nm.85 conformationally constrained tricyclic analogs that form a 5-membered ring were
generally less potent compared with their unconstrained partner.86 to potentially avoid the
hepatomegaly observed in the 6-phenyl-dihydroquinolines, 6-phenyl bioisosteres were substituted on
other dihydroquinolines. from this work, various 6-thienyl-dihydroquinolines were identified and
showed pr antagonist activity.65 for example, compound 61 had an ic50 of 24 nm in the cv-1 cotransfection assay and was orally active in rodent models. the 6-thienyl-dihydroquinoline 61 showed
no hepatomegaly at the pharmacological dose. the 3-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinolines such as 62
had pr antagonist activity in the cv-1 co-transfection assay showing an ic50 of 14 nm. saturated
compounds such as the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinolines 63 showed pr antagonist activity with an ic50 of
31 nm. some of the 6-aryl-dihydroquinolines and their analogs were profiled in the t47d cell line and
showed a range of functional activity from weakly potent pr antagonists to partial agonists.65
j. derivatives of 6-aryl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-ones

various benzimidazolones and benzthiazolones were reported to show pr antagonist activity in the
cv-1 pr/pre-luciferase and t47d alkaline phosphatase assays.87 compounds 64 and 65 had
activity in the pre-luciferase assay with ic50 values of 106 and 326 nm, respectively. they showed
better potency in the t47d alkaline phosphatase assay with ic50 values of 29 and 84 nm, respectively.
in vitro potency was determined by the lipophilic substituent at the 1-position of the
benzoimidazolones.87

converting the thiocarbonyl group of 37 to a carbonyl reversed the pr functional profiles of these
compounds to antagonist.88 an sar study of these compounds showed that many 5-aryl substituents
were tolerated and that small lipophilic groups at the 3-position provided pr antagonist activity in the
alkaline phosphatase assay.88 among the most potent in this series were the 5-(3-cyano-5fluorophenyl) indol-2-ones 66, 67, and 68 with ic50s ranging from 13 to 20 nm in a t47d alkaline
phosphatase assay. also, all three compounds were active in the rat decidualization assay at a dose of
3 mg/kg, po.88

l. derivatives of 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazin-2-ones

as with the 5-aryl-indol-2-thiones and indol-2-ones, pr functional activity was changed from
agonistic to antagonistic when converting the 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazin-2-ones to the
corresponding 6-aryl-benzoxazine-2-thiones.89 many of these compounds showed pr antagonist
activity in the in vitro pr/pre-luciferase and alkaline phosphatase assays.89 but for many of the
compounds, results in the alkaline phosphatase and pre luciferase assay were inconsistent with
functional activity. for instance, compounds 69 and 70 were moderately potent pr agonists with
ec50 values of 90.0 and 61.1 nm, respectively, in the alkaline phosphatase assay. however, these
compounds were potent pr antagonists with ic50 values of 15.9 and 6.7 nm, respectively, in the cv-1
pre-luciferase assay.89 both compounds did have robust pr antagonist activity similar to
mifepristone in the ovariectomized mature female rat decidualization model when administrated
orally. as with its sister series (e.g., 40), this series had sensitive sar which was dependent on the
placement of substituents on the core template. substituents at the 2 0 - or 6 0 -positions generally led to
a reduction in activity. however, re-positioning the 5 0 -fluorine of compound 69 to the 4 0 -substitution
71, or replacing the sulfur atom of 70 with an oxygen atom as in 72, gave molecules that displayed
good antagonist activity in vitro with ic50 values of 13.9 and 8 nm, respectively, in a t47d assay.
agonist activity was also found in the rat decidual model with these compounds having ed50 values
of 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg po, respectively.

m. cyclic and acyclic carboxamidines and 2-arylimino heterocycles

bayer described two similar classes of cyclic and acyclic carboxamidines and 2-arylimino
heterocycles as pr modulators for various indications.90,91 in the carboxamidine series, prototype
compounds are illustrated in compounds 73–75. a 2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl moiety was found to be a
desirable group for activity when attached to the imine nitrogen. cyclic and acyclic carboxamidines
were evaluated for pr binding using protein from t47d cell cytosol and radio-labeled
progesterone.90 in this assay, compounds 73 and 74 had 80%–100% inhibition of the radio-labeled
ligand at a concentration of 200 nm. heteroaryl groups, such as the quinoline in 75, were reported to
provide less potency in their pr binding in comparison to the 2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl substituent of
analog 74. in the 2-arylimino heterocycles, thiazolidines such as 76 inhibited the binding of radiolabeled progesterone at 80%–100% when tested in the t47d cell cytosol binding assay at 200 nm.91
analogs containing 6- and 7-membered rings, such as 77 and 78, showed similar binding potency to
76. replacement of the thiazolidine core with thiazolinones, as in 79, furnished compounds with
potency in pr binding equal to that of 76. oxazolidines, represented by 80, were as potent as 76 in pr
binding affinity. compounds such as 4,5-dihydrothiazole 81 also inhibited 80%–100% of radiolabeled progesterone pr binding at a concentration of 200 nm.

scientists at glaxosmithkline have reported the discovery of 4- and 5-substituted pyrazolines as
potent pr antagonists.92 using a homology model of pr in the antagonist mode and structure-guided
design, compounds such as 82 were predicted, and found to be, potent and efficacious antagonists.
the 4-substituted r-methyl derivative, such as 83, was a partial agonist with a binding affinity ki of
19 nm in a proprietary pr fluorescence polarization (fp) assay and an ic50 of 25 nm (51% of ru486)
in a hpr-b bacmam assay in cv-1 cells using an mmtv-luciferase promoter.92 the racemic (r/s)p-n,n-dimethylaniline 82 was an antagonist with a binding affinity ki of 19 nm in the fp assay and an
ic50 of 79 nm (95% of ru486) in the cell-based assay.92

7. compound interactions with the  xxxg1737xxx 
ligand binding domain
pr is a multi-functional protein, containing distinct n-terminal, dna-binding, hinge, and ligandbinding domains (lbds). the two isoforms of pr, pra and prb, are splicing variants from the same
gene, with different n-termini but identical ligand-binding domains. thus, although detailed
interactions of the compound with the hormone-binding domain are identical for both pr isoforms,
the functional consequences differ depending on the makeup of the pr dimer bound to the promoter
sequence. nevertheless, information about compound binding to pr can aid attempts to improve
potency and selectivity and provide clues for functional modulation.
another impediment to understanding the link between ligand structure and pr functionality is
the lack of diversity of compounds in pr/ligand structures. although pr ligands have been described
with a diverse range of functional activity, all publicly available pr lbd/ligand structures consist of
pr bound to potent agonists.93–96 these structures provide clues about important pr/ligand interactions, but they are all derived from the same crystal form (p21 with two molecules per asymmetric
unit) and show very little protein conformational variability (fig. 1a). in fact, the rms difference
between corresponding ca atoms for the same subunit from different complexes essentially is the
same as between subunits in the same crystal. does pr adopt the identical conformation for all potent
agonists, thereby favoring this crystal form; or does it like to crystallize in this form and constrain
the conformation with different compounds? further studies are needed to answer this question.
pr/ligand structures representing a functionally diverse set of ligands are required to determine the
relationship between conformational changes and observed transcriptional activity.
most of the pr/ligand structures are of atomic resolution, allowing detailed comparison of the
protein conformation. the overlap between them extends beyond main chain position, to details of
the side chain conformation within the binding pocket (fig. 1b). an overlay of five different complex
structures shows that the position of the side chains varies little, with the exception of the noticeable
changes for phe794, leu797, and tyr890 caused by the large 17a furoate moiety of mometasone
furoate. this degree of conformational overlap suggests a set of required interactions with pocket
residues are necessary for tight pr binding. both the steroid progesterone95 and the non-steroid
tanaproget96 form a hydrogen bond network upon binding to pr (fig. 2). the 3-keto oxygen of
progesterone and the cyano nitrogen of  xxxd3286xxx  form direct hydrogen bonds to gln725. these
direct ligand/protein hydrogen bonds are strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds to residues
gln725 and arg766 via a conserved water molecule. the ligands are positioned for these hydrogen
bonds by hydrophobic interactions with phe778. the carbonyl of phe778 also forms a hydrogen bond
with arg766. thus, there is a highly cooperative network of interactions that stabilizes the position
and orientation of the ligand by the residues of the binding pocket.
despite the lack of obvious pr/progesterone interactions around the d-ring,95 some of the other
potent agonists display specific polar interactions with the protein.  xxxd2665xxx  (fig. 3a) and
 xxxd3286xxx  (fig. 3b) make direct hydrogen bonds to asn719.74,93  xxxd2751xxx , and likely other
estranes as well, shift slightly in the pocket, allowing space for a water molecule to mediate a

hydrogen bond between the ligand and asn719.93 hydrogen bonds to this conserved asparagine have
been shown to stabilize the position of the af2 helix and promote agonism in mr.49
other pocket interactions that account for the tight binding are essentially hydrophobic, and
therefore less specific. an overlay of the ligands (fig. 4a) shows that even the steroids fill the cavity in
a variety of ways, and only converge at the ‘‘3’’ position. however, the residues in pr make only
minor adjustments to accommodate these ligands (fig. 4b). in fact, only small differences at residues
phe794, leu797, and tyr890 were required to create the 17a pocket that accommodates the large

and  xxxd3286xxx  (cyan ligand and protein, red water) both form direct hydrogen bonds to gln725 which are strengthened by water

furoate ester moiety of  xxxd2665xxx . this observation correlates with the previously
mentioned principle of least action for pr/agonist crystal structures, where the pocket residues make
the smallest motion needed to accommodate a ligand. ligands that exceed this minimal allowed
motion either do not bind as well to pr, or are not as agonistic.
antagonists, such as mifepristone, cause a conformational change in pr which correlates with a
difference in biological activity.97,98 in gr, a comparison of the dexamethasone and mifepristone
complexes suggests that the changes are mostly associated with the conformation of the af2.99 in
agreement with proteolysis data,97,98 pr likely undergoes a similar af2 conformational change upon
the binding of mifepristone, which allows the binding of the transcriptional co-repressors.100 it is
worth noting that met909, a residue on the af2, closes off the pr ligand binding pocket (fig. 4b) but
possibly could be forced out of position by an 11b substituted ligand, such as mifepristone.95
surprisingly, the c-terminal residues of pr are required for antagonism as well as agonism. when the
c-terminal 42 residues of pr are truncated, the protein does not bind agonists, but activates
transcription in the presence of mifepristone.101 in fact, the c-terminal 12 residues, the ‘‘f’’ domain,
of pr are required for the antagonist effects of mifepristone.102 how can a small stretch of residues
that packs against the helix 8/helix 10 interface be responsible for the diverse biological effects of pr
bound to different ligands? a pr antagonist structure is needed to definitively answer these questions.
other steroidal non-agonists, such as onapristone (30) and asoprisnil (31), have a c11 pendant
group like mifepristone, and likely cause the same af2 shift. if the pr af2 shifts to the same extent as
that of gr when binding a ligand with a c11 pendant group, a new protein surface is created, with the
capping substituent on the end of the c11 pendant group forming part of that surface. the pendant
group of onapristone is identical to that of mifepristone, so the new surface created by the af2 shift
will also likely be the same. it is unknown how the changes induced by different moieties around the
onapristone c17 and c18 produce the functionality observed. the polar oxime moiety of asoprisnil
likely mediates the ‘‘partial antagonist’’ effects of this compound compared to the more hydrophobic
dimethyl amine of the full antagonists. the surface created by the af2 shift will have some polar
character to it, and will alter the interactions with co-factors.
as mentioned previously, the paucity of non-steroidal pr structures, and of non-agonist pr
structures, makes it difficult to develop a more general set of rules for predicting ligand-induced pr
functionality. most of the non-steroidal compounds are small and flat, and act as agonists. many, such
as  xxxd3286xxx  (41), have a cyano or nitro group to mimic the steroid o3 on the a-ring. others have no
obvious a-ring but still act as agonists (e.g., 47) even with a pendant group. the pyrazolines (82, 83)
appear to follow the same rule as steroids, with the dimethyl aniline acting as the mifepristone c11
pendant group. presumably some of the non-steroidal partial agonists act in a similar fashion, by
pushing on met909 with smaller substituents that do not force a conformation shift of the af2. more
difficult to predict are those that show large functional changes with small structural changes, such as
the conversion of the agonist (51) to an antagonist (52) via small substitution changes in the phenyl
ring, or conversion of the agonist (37) to the antagonist (68) via the substitution of an oxygen for a
sulfur. does the ligand orientation, the protein conformation, or both, change with a small change in
the chemical template? more structural and chemical data are required before ligand-induced pr
functionality can be predicted.
while the ligand-binding pocket in pr of most species accommodates substitutions at the
steroid position 11b, like the dimethylaniline group of mifepristone, the amino acid glycine at
position 722 appears to be critical for mifepristone binding and action. hamster and the chicken pr
are insensitive to mifepristone and have a cysteine rather than a glycine at this position. mutation of
this cysteine by a glycine in chicken pr restores the binding and antagonistic action of mifepristone.
likewise, substitution of cysteine at position 722 in the human pr generates a receptor that no
longer binds mifepristone. the human gr also has a glycine in this corresponding position, and
cysteine substitution produces a loss of binding, not only to mifepristone, but also to dexamethasone.
taken together, these results suggest that gly722 in human pr is at a position in the 11b-pocket

of the receptor that is critical for mifepristone’s biological action.103 this type of spontaneous
mutation in the pr of humans may account for the unresponsiveness to mifepristone observed in
some women.

8. conclusions
 xxxg1737xxx  is one of the first nuclear receptors to have its corresponding hormone purified
and characterized. this identification led to pr’s successful recognition as a drug target for
contraception, a therapy that has been in practice worldwide for close to 50 years. over that time
period, pr ligands have evolved from steroids that mimic the effects of progesterone, to steroids that
mimic but improve on progesterone’s biological effects, to steroids that have different biological
effects from those of progesterone, and finally to non-steroids with a wide array of activities and
possible therapeutic indications.
pr ligands have also evolved to include compounds throughout the functional spectrum from
full agonists to full antagonists. pr ligands have shown a consistency in the a-ring portion of the
molecule, with the real functional changes seen with c- and d-ring variations. the path to
antagonism (full or partial) in steroidal compounds is through substitutions on the 11b position, with
large pendant groups pushing on met909 and forcing a conformational change in the af2. partial
agonists presumably also push on met909, but with not enough to force a conformation shift. the
switch to the wide variety of non-steroidal ligands permits a wider spectrum of interactions with pr
and of functional consequences than was possible with the steroid scaffold. we expect the next 50
years will see a similar increase in understanding the myriad roles of pr and a corresponding
improvement in pr-targeted therapies.
