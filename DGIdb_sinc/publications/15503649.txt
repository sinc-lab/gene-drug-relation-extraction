 xxxd1682xxx  analogs: novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease?   xxxd1682xxx  plays a key role in regulating calcium and mineral homeostasis in support of normal development and maintenance of bone. the classic effects of  xxxd1682xxx  include promoting absorption of dietary calcium in the gut and, through its actions as a steroid endocrine hormone, regulating the synthesis and secretion of  xxxg1885xxx . the effects of the  xxxd1682xxx  system are mediated through the highly regulated generation of the potent, active metabolite 1,25- xxxd408xxx  (calcitriol).  xxxd1682xxx  exerts its effects through the vitamin  xxxg657xxx  (vdr), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor expressed in a wide array of tissue and cell types. studies performed in mice rendered deficient for vdr suggest that calcitriol and vdr may inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and reduce blood pressure in the long-term. clinical studies suggest that administration of  xxxd1682xxx  analogs produces differential benefit with regards to mortality in dialysis patients; other studies suggest that  xxxd1682xxx  analogs may provide cardiovascular benefit in both dialysis and nondialysis patients. this paper reviews clinical and preclinical studies, which suggest that  xxxd1682xxx  analogs may provide therapeutic utility in the treatment of cardiovascular disease independent of those mechanisms typically associated with the  xxxd1682xxx  endocrine system.
