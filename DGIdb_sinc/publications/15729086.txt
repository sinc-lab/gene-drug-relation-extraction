antagonist, on olanzapine-induced weight gain in
first-episode schizophrenia patients

histamine antagonism has been implicated in antipsychotic
drug-induced weight gain.  xxxd321xxx , a histamine
enhancer with h1 agonistic/h3 antagonistic properties
(48 mg t.i.d.), was coadministered with olanzapine (10 mg/
day) in three first-episode schizophrenia patients for 6
weeks. body weight was measured at baseline and weekly
thereafter. clinical rating scales were completed at
baseline and at week 6. all participants gained weight
(mean weight gain 3.1 ± 0.9 kg) and a similar pattern of
weight gain was observed: an increase during the first
2 weeks and no additional weight gain (two patients) or
minor weight loss (one patient) from weeks 3 to 6. none
gained 7% of baseline weight, which is the cut-off for
clinically significant weight gain.  xxxd321xxx  was safe and
well tolerated and did not interfere with the antipsychotic
effect of olanzapine. our findings justify a placebocontrolled evaluation of the putative weight-attenuating

effect of  xxxd321xxx  in olanzapine-induced weight gain.

introduction

receptor affinity profiles of typical and atypical antipsychotics and their potential to induce weight gain and
found that the most robust predictor of a propensity to
increase weight was the affinity to the h1-receptor. it is
worthy of note that the antipsychotic agents (clozapine,
olanzapine) and antidepressants ( xxxd156xxx , mirtazapine) have the highest propensity to induce weight gain,
and are potent h1-antagonists.

the mechanism underlying atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain has not yet been determined, although
the histaminergic system has consistently been implicated (baptista et al., 2002; kroeze et al., 2003). even
though an initial report described the potential of the h2antagonist  xxxd2744xxx  to attenuate olanzapine-induced
weight-gain (sacchetti et al., 2000), a subsequent
controlled study demonstrated only an early transient
effect of the drug that waned by week 16 of the trial
(cavazzoni et al., 2003). another h2-antagonist,  xxxd2082xxx , proved ineffective in preventing/attenuating olanzapine-induced weight gain in a small placebo-controlled
study (poyurovsky et al., 2004). hence, it appears that h2
antagonists ( xxxd2744xxx ,  xxxd2082xxx ) are of limited value
in the management of olanzapine-induced weight gain in
schizophrenia patients.
the histamine  xxxg1078xxx  appears to be an alternative
mediator of feeding behaviour and weight regulation
within the histaminergic system (rossi et al., 1999). the
h1-receptor antagonism increases feeding in rodents
(fukagawa et al., 1989) and h1-knockout mice are prone
to obesity and are resistant to the anorectic effect of
leptin (masaki et al., 2001). wirshing et al. (1999) and
kroeze et al. (2003) evaluated the relationship between

 xxxd321xxx , a structured analog of histamine, exerts h1
receptor agonistic and h3 receptor antagonistic properties
(fossati et al., 2001; lacour and sterkers, 2001). the drug
crosses the blood–brain barrier and acts centrally by
enhancing histamine synthesis in tuberomammillary
nuclei of the posterior hypothalamus (lacour and
sterkers, 2001).  xxxd321xxx  has been shown to inhibit
food intake and increase the satiety signal in animal
models of obesity (rossi et al., 1999; szelag et al., 2001).
 xxxd321xxx  is used clinically in the treatment of vertigo,
and was shown to be safe and well tolerated, without
significant drug–drug interactions (mira et al., 2003).
overall, these findings suggest that  xxxd321xxx  may be
efficacious in the prevention and/or attenuation of weight
gain induced by atypical antipsychotics. because
young and previously untreated patients appear to be
particularly vulnerable to antipsychotic-induced weight

gain (potenza et al., 1999), we evaluated a putative
moderating effect of  xxxd321xxx  on olanzapine-induced
weight gain in first-episode drug-naı̈ve schizophrenia
patients.

methods
three patients who were hospitalized for a first episode
of schizophrenic disorder (three men; mean age 22 ± 1.7
years; mean duration of illness 1.5 ± 0.4 years) at the
tirat carmel mental health center, tirat carmel, israel,
participated in the trial. all patients underwent a
structured clinical interview for dsm-iv axis-i disorders. patients with medical illnesses that could affect
body weight (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism) and
patients who had body mass index (bmi) r 30 kg/m2
were excluded. the study was approved by the institutional review board. the nature of the study was
explained in detail to potential participants and the
attending physician evaluated and confirmed their
capacity to provide their informed consent to participate
in the trial. accordingly, written informed consent was
then obtained from all recruits before the initiation of
study procedures.
 xxxd321xxx  (48 mg/day t.i.d) was coadministered with
olanzapine (10 mg, once daily) for 6 weeks. weight and
bmi were measured at baseline and weekly thereafter at
08.00 h before breakfast. clinical rating scales, completed
at baseline and at the end of week 6, included the
clinical global impression (cgi) scale (guy, 1976), the
scale for the assessment of positive (saps) (andreasen,
1984) and negative symptoms (sans) (andreasen,
1983) and the hamilton rating scale for depression
(ham-d) (hamilton, 1967). emergent drug-induced
side-effects were closely monitored.

results
all participants completed the 6-week trial and gained
weight (mean weight gain was 3.1 ± 0.9 kg). all demonstrated a similar pattern of weight gain over the study
period, namely an increase in weight during the initial 2
weeks of the trial with no additional weight gain (two
patients) or a minor reduction of body weight (one
patient) from weeks 3 to 6 (table 1). none gained 7% of
initial body weight, which is the cut-off for clinically
significant weight gain (kanders et al., 1991).
there was a significant decrease from baseline to week 6
in the cgi (4.0 ± 0.1 versus 2.3 ± 0.6; t = 4.91, p < 0.01)
and in the saps (3.5 ± 1.4 versus 0.5 ± 0.9; t = 3.12,
p < 0.05), and a non-significant decrease in the sans
(10.0 ± 5.3 versus 7.7 ± 4.7; t = 0.56, p = 0.60) and
ham-d (7.0 ± 5.3 versus 1.3 ± 2.3; t = 1.71; p = 0.16)
scores.  xxxd321xxx  addition was safe and well tolerated,
and no clinically significant side-effects of the olanzapine- xxxd321xxx  combination were revealed.

discussion
all study participants gained weight, suggesting that
 xxxd321xxx  is ineffective in the prevention of olanzapineinduced increase in body weight. however, the lack of
weight gain from week 2 to the end of the study, after the
initial increase in the first 2 weeks, indicates a possible
attenuating effect of  xxxd321xxx  on olanzapine-induced
weight gain. the lack of a placebo control precludes
definitive conclusions. however, the mean weight gain in
 xxxd321xxx /olanzapine-treated patients (3.1 ± 0.9 kg)
was lower than that observed in two groups of olanzapine/placebo-treated patients with similar clinical and
weight characteristics at baseline in our previous studies
of fluoxetine (poyurovsky et al., 2002) or  xxxd3089xxx 
(poyurovsky et al., 2003) addition to olanzapine for
attenuation of weight gain (5.0 ± 1.2 kg and
5.5 ± 3.1 kg, respectively). because the possible weight
gain attenuation was observed only after 2 weeks, the
marked antagonistic effect on the presynaptic h3
receptor, rather than the direct but weak agonistic effect
on postsynaptic h1 receptors (lacour and sterkers,
2001), may account for the delayed weight gain attenuation. because olanzapine treatment was associated with a
significant improvement of positive symptoms and
general psychopathology, it appears that  xxxd321xxx 
does not interfere with the beneficial antipsychotic
effect of olanzapine. it is worthy of note that potential
therapeutic properties of h3 receptor antagonists
in schizophrenia have also been suggested (morisset
et al., 1999). the lack of any clinically significant
side-effects indicates that the olanzapine/ xxxd321xxx 
combination is safe and well tolerated in schizophrenia
patients.
overall, the findings of the present study appear to justify
a placebo-controlled evaluation of the putative weightattenuating effect of  xxxd321xxx  in antipsychotic-induced
weight gain.
