involvement of serotonin 2a receptors in
phencyclidine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition
of the acoustic startle in rats

and masatoshi tanaka
background: the disruption of prepulse inhibition of
acoustic startle (ppi) is an animal model for some aspects
of schizophrenia. phencyclidine causes psychotomimetic
symptoms in human and disrupts ppi in animals, however,
the mechanism underlying this disruption remains unclear. the present experiment tested the hypothesis that
serotonin 2a receptor blocking property of drugs reverses
the phencyclidine-induced ppi disruption.
methods: the ed50 value of spiperone, haloperidol,
chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, seroquel, pipamperone,  xxxd2637xxx , or desipramine to reverse
the phencyclidine- or apomorphine-induced ppi disruption in rats was determined. then the correlation between
the ed50 value and the affinity for the serotonin 2a, 2c,
dopamine d2, or ␣-1 receptor of each drug was examined.
results: the ed50 value of the drugs to reverse the
phencyclidine-induced ppi disruption was significantly
correlated with the affinity for the serotonin 2a receptor,
but not for the dopamine d2, serotonin 2c, or ␣-1 receptor
of each drug. in contrast, the ed50 value of the drugs to
reverse the apomorphine-induced ppi disruption was
significantly correlated with the affinity for the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx , but not for the serotonin 2a receptor.
conclusions: an activation of serotonin 2a receptors
would mediate the phencyclidine-induced ppi disruption.

introduction

t

he startle reaction to a strong acoustic stimulus is
reduced by the prior presentation of a weak stimulus
(graham 1975). this reduction, termed prepulse inhibition

(ppi), has been used as a measure of sensorimotor gating and
is significantly diminished in schizophrenic patients (braff
1978). in animal studies, ppi is changed by manipulations of
neural circuitry linking the limbic cortex, striatum, pallidum,
thalamus, and pontine reticular formation (kodsi et al 1995;
lipska et al 1995). in particular, ppi is disrupted by systemic
apomorphine. the disruption of ppi by apomorphine is
reversed by the administration of  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists but not by  xxxg655xxx  antagonists,
with potency correlating well with clinically effective dosages of each drug. substantial evidence supports the importance of dopaminergic activity in the nucleus accumbens in
regulating ppi (swerdlow 1994; yamada, et al 1998). thus,
the disruption of ppi is a valid animal model for some aspects
of schizophrenia (swerdlow et al 1994; wan et al 1995;
johansson et al 1995). phencyclidine, a noncompetitive
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist, causes
psychotomimetic symptoms in human subjects and also
disrupts ppi in animals; however, the precise mechanism
underlying this disruption remains unclear. phencyclidineinduced ppi disruption was reversed by the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine (bakshi et al 1994), olanzapine (bakshi
and geyer 1995),  xxxd3096xxx  (johansson et al 1994), and
seroquel (swerdlow et al 1996), but not by halperidol (keith
et al 1991; hoffman et al 1993). dizocilpine, a noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist, induced disruption of ppi
was restored by  xxxd2419xxx , a serotonin 2a antagonist (varty
and higgins, 1995a). these data led us to hypothesize that the
serotonin 2a antagonistic property of each drug may restore
the phencyclidine- or dizocilpine-induced disruption of ppi.
to clarify the involvement of the serotonin 2a receptor
underlying the disruption of ppi by phencyclidine in rats, we
investigated whether the potency of various drugs to reverse
the phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi correlated with
the affinity to serotonin 2a receptor of each drug or not.

light/dark schedule (lights on  xxxd2274xxx  am) with food and water
provided ad libitum. the behavioral testing was performed
between 9 am and 3 pm, during the light phase. two startle
chambers (sr-lab, san diego instruments, san diego, ca)
were placed in a sound-attenuated room with a 60-db ambient
noise level. each chamber consisted of a plexiglas cylinder 8.2
cm in diameter resting in a 12.5 ⫻ 22.5 cm plexiglas frame
within a ventilated enclosure. acoustic noise bursts and background noise were presented via a supertweeter speaker (radio
shack, usa) mounted 24 cm above the animal. the sound levels
were measured and calibrated with a quest sound level meter. a
piezoelectric device mounted below the plexiglas frame detected
and transduced motion within the cylinder. the delivery of
acoustic stimuli was controlled by an sr-lab microcomputer
and interface assembly (san diego instruments) that rectified
and digitized (from 0 to 4095) stabilimeter readings, and then
recorded them. the readings were collected for 1 ms beginning
at the stimulus onset. the scale-response sensitivities were
calibrated using sr-lab startle calibration system. each startle
session began with a 5-min acclimation period in the chamber to
68 db background noise. after the acclimation period for 5 min,
the rat was exposed to two stimulus types presented in a
pseudorandom order: a 120-db 40-ms noise burst (p); or p
preceded 100 ms earlier by a 20-ms noise burst 8 db above
background (pp), with a variable intertrial interval (average 15
sec) for a total of 36 trials (18 prepulse trials and 18 pulse alone
trials). the startle amplitude for each type of stimulus was
defined as the mean maximum value of trials measured in
arbitrary units. the percentage ppi was defined as 100 ⫺ [(startle
amplitude on pp trials/startle amplitude on p trials)⫻100].

drug treatment
seven days before drug testing, male wistar rats (350 to 400g,
n ⫽ 50 to 90 for one testing drug) were individually placed in
a startle chamber with 68 db background noise. after a 5-min
acclimation period, the rat was exposed to two stimulus types
presented in a pseudorandom order; a 120-db 40-ms noise burst
(p); or p preceded 100 ms earlier by a 20-ms noise burst 8 db
above background (pp), for a total of 36 trials. the rats were
divided into five groups matched for mean ppi on these trials.
dose levels of each drug were set according to the clinical
potency of each drug. each rat was pretreated with one dose of
haloperidol (0, .03, .1, .3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally;
rbi, natick, ma), clozapine (0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, ip, sandoz,
hanover, nj), risperidone (0, .03, .1, or 0.3 mg/kg, ip, janssenkyowa, tokyo, japan), chlorpromazine (0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, ip,
yoshitomi, osaka, japan), spiperone (0, .03, .01, or .3 mg/kg, ip,
rbi, natick, ma), seroquel (0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, ip, zeneka,
cheshire, uk), pipamperone (0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, ip, eisai,
tokyo, japan), olanzapine (0, .3, 1, or 3 mg/kg, ip, eli lilly,
indianapolis, in),  xxxd2637xxx  (0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, ip, rbi,
natick, ma), or desipramine (0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, ip, rbi,
natick, ma). thirty min later, the rats were treated with
phencyclidine (vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg, ip) or apomorphine (vehicle or 1 mg/kg, ip), then placed in the startle chamber for a 5-min
acclimation period, and tested as described above. if the highest
dose of each drug had no effect on phencyclidine-induced

disruption of ppi, an increased dose was employed. in the case of
haloperidol, increased doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) were tested,
because there was no effect from 1 mg/kg of haloperidol. in the
case of clozapine or seroquel, these drugs tended to reverse the
phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi, but the effect was not
significant. so additional rats (n ⫽ 10 for clozapine and n ⫽ 5 for
seroquel) were tested until a significance was obtained. each rat was
tested twice to observe the effects of the same drug on the
apomorphine- and phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi at an
interval of 1 week. the drug (apomorphine or pcp) was counterbalanced, i.e., apomorphine was tested in half of the groups while
the other half was tested by phencyclidine, then 1 week later, the
opposite drug challenge was performed in each half of the group.

data analyses
a one-way analysis of variance with fisher post-hoc comparisons was used to assess differences in the drug-induced changes
in ppi. the ed50 values were estimated by the dose of the drug
that caused 50% recovery from apomorphine- or phencyclidineinduced reduction of ppi from the dose–response curve drawn
using computer graphic software (crikett graph). the correlation
between the ed50 value of the drug required to attenuate
apomorphine- or phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi and
the ki d2, ki serotonin 2a, ki serotonin 2c, or ki ␣-1 value of
each drug was calculated by pearson correlation.

results
as shown in figure 1, the control ppi was 65.7 ⫾ 3.9
(mean % ⫾ sem). phencyclidine and apomorphine both
reduced the ppi in a dose-dependent manner. the reduction of ppi by 1.5 mg/kg ip of phencyclidine was
significant compared with that by vehicle injection (ppi,

anova). apomorphine (1 mg/kg) also reduced the ppi

disruption of ppi. these data are consistent with the
previous findings that clozapine (bakshi et al 1994),
seroquel (swerdlow et al 1996), and olanzapine (bakshi
and geyer 1995), but not halperidol (keith et al 1991;
hoffman et al 1993) attenuated the phencyclidine-induced
reduction of ppi in rats. risperidone also attenuated the
phencyclidine-induced reduction of ppi in wistar rats, as
reported by varty and higgins (1995b) that disocilpineinduced disruption of ppi was restored by risperidone.
however, swerdlow et al (1996) failed to find this effect
of risperidone. this discrepancy may be explained by the
difference of animal species (we and varty used wistar
rats and swerdlow et al used spraque dawley rats) and/or
the difference in the time schedule of the drug administration. the drug potency for the attenuation of the
phencyclidine-induced reduction of ppi was significantly
correlated with the ki serotonin 2a receptor affinity of
each drug but not significantly correlated with the ki d2
receptor affinity, the ki serotonin 2c receptor affinity, or
the ␣-1 receptor affinity of each drug. although,  xxxd3000xxx ,
an ␣-1 receptor antagonist has been reported to attenuate
the phencyclidine-induced reduction of ppi (bakshi et al
1997), antagonism of ␣-1 receptors may not play a major
role in mediating the blockade of phencyclidine-induced
reduction of ppi by neuroleptics.  xxxd2637xxx , which possesses a high affinity for serotonin 2a receptors, attenuated the phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi, but
failed to attenuate the apomorphine-induced disruption of
ppi. this result was consistent with the previous finding
that the dizocilpine-induced disruption of ppi was attenuated by  xxxd2419xxx , a serotonin 2a antagonist (varty and
higgins 1995a). these data suggest that the mechanism
underlying the disruption of ppi induced by phencyclidine
is due to the activation of serotonin 2a receptors. however, little is known about how serotonin 2a receptors
contribute to the phenycylclidine-induced disruption of
ppi. we observed that the ppi value of each rat was
negatively correlated with the 5-hydroxy-indole acetic
acid (5-hiaa) levels in the striatum, nucleus accumbens,
and prefrontal cortex (unpublished data). the systemic
administration of doi, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (a serotonin 2a agonist) was reported to disrupt ppi
in rats (sipes and geyer 1994), which was antagonized by
the microinfusion of mdl 100,907, a specific serotonin
2a antagonist into the ventral pallidum but not into the
nucleus accumbens (sipes and geyer 1997). these data
indicate that the activity of serotonergic neurons in the
ventral pallidum may influence the ppi value of each rat.
it has been reported that serotonin 2a receptor antagonists
reversed phencyclidine-induced locomotor activity (gleason and shannon 1997; maurel et al 1995), head-twitch
and head-weaving (nabeshima et al 1984, 1987; yamaguchi et al 1987). phencyclidine was reported to increase the

prepulse inhibition and serotonin 2a receptor

extracelluler level of serotonin and 5-hiaa in the nucleus
accumbens (hernandez et al 1988) and striatum (lillrank
et al 1994) and to inhibit the uptake of 3h-serotonin (hori
et al 1996). dizocilpine increased serotonin metabolism in
rat several brain regions (loscher et al 1991). in an
electrophysiologic study, phencyclidine produced a concentration-dependent depression of the monosynaptic reflex which was antagonized by serotonin 2 receptor
antagonists (ohno and warnick 1989). these data suggest
that phencyclidine increases the extracelluler levels of
serotonin, resulting in the induction of behavioral and
physiologic changes. chlorpromazine did not fully restore
phencyclidine-induced disruption of ppi. it has been
reported that a high dose of the d1 antagonist sch23390
decreased ppi (swerdlow et al 1991). d1 antagonistic
property of chlorpromazine at the highest dose (30 mg/kg)
may cause an inverted u shaped chlorpromazine dose–
response curve.
all of the drugs used in the present study except
 xxxd2637xxx  and desipramine attenuated the apomorphine
induced reduction of ppi. the potency for these drugs in
attenuating the reduction of ppi was significantly correlated with the ki d2 value of each drug. these results
confirmed previous findings (swerdlow et al 1994). thus,
the potencies of neuroleptics to attenuate apomorphine
induced disruption of prepulse inhibition of the acoustic
startle in rat better correlated with their dopamine d2
affinities than their serotonin 2a affinities, while their
potencies to attenuate phencyclidine-induced disruption of
ppi better correlated with their serotonin 2a affinities. the
data indicate that the disruption of ppi by phencyclidine
could be generated by the activation of serotonin 2a
receptors but not by that of dopamine d2 receptors.
phencyclidine causes schizophrenia-like symptoms in human subjects, which include sensorimotor gating deficit. a
number of serotonergic agonists have been shown to
sometimes exacerbate symptoms of schizophrenia (krystal et
al 1993; marshall et al 1989). the present results suggest that
serotonin 2a receptor blocking property of neuroleptics may
contribute to the amelioration of some aspects of the psychotic state caused by the nondopaminergic system.
