covering letter and a questionnaire covering the diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis in
childhood was circulated between october 1992 and february 1993 amongst 672 european members
of the european thyroid association (eta) and members of the european society for pediatric
endocrinology (espe). almost 50% replied to the letter and 99 individuals or groups from 22 countries
completed the questionnaire. a consensus was reached on the use of total thyroxine (t4) and/or free
t4 and  xxxd3368xxx  as routine diagnostic tools. two-thirds included total triiodothyronine (t3 ) and/or
free t3 and 32% used a  xxxg2328xxx  test. surprisingly, thyroglobulin autoantibodies were used as a routine test by 78%; 63% included  xxxg2341xxx  antibodies and 60%
microsomal antibodies, whereas only 50% measured  xxxg2320xxx  antibodies. for thyroid imaging,
40% performed a thyroid scintigram and 56% measured the size of the thyroid gland by ultrasound.
antithyroid drugs (atd) were the basic initial treatment of choice given by 99% of the respondents for
children with uncomplicated graves' disease.  xxxd435xxx ,  xxxd2594xxx  and  xxxd2594xxx  were the
most frequently used drugs, with a median initial dose of 0.8 mg \m=.\kg1 day1. two-thirds added betablockers and a few used sedatives. the atd dose was adjusted for each patient by 39%, whereas 56%
combined atd with t4 for long-term treatment; 84% gave treatment for a fixed period (44% for 1\p=n-\2
years). surgery was considered the treatment of choice in children with an adenoma (83%), with a
nodular (53%) or large goiter (16%) and recurrence after atd (14%). radioiodine was the treatment
of choice by 18% of the respondents for patients with recurrence after surgery and recurrence after

disease in childhood. because
frequently at puberty, the
patients may be treated by either pediatrie endocrinologists or by internists and adult endocrinologists.
therefore, few prospective collaborative studies have
examined the rationale approach to the diagnosis and
treatment of thyrotoxicosis in children. we wanted to
survey the present european consensus on diagnosis
and treatment in order to identify problems and to
create the knowledge necessary to launch relevant
prospective clinical studies. questionnaire studies on
treatment of thyrotoxicosis in adults have been
conducted in europe, the usa and japan (1, 2), and
the results have raised many fruitful discussions. with
this in mind, a questionnaire on the diagnosis and
treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood was circulated
to all european members of the european thyroid

association (eta) and to members of the european
society of pediatrie endocrinology (espe). the ques¬
tionnaire was a modification of a questionnaire
designed by an eta working group in 1985 (1).
while there may be reservations about the value of
questionnaire studies, in our opinion the response rate
in the present study was large enough to justify
conclusions. this paper thus summarizes a european
consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of thyro¬
toxicosis in childhood in 1993. however, prospective
studies are needed to reach a rationale approach to the
diagnosis and treatment in the future.

materials and methods
a total of 672 letters were circulated to all european
members of eta and espe between october 1992 and
february 1993.

graves' disease and physicians were asked to outline
their basic diagnostic and therapeutic approach. the
questionnaire listed all available thyroid function tests,
both in vitro and in vivo, including the possibility of
giving the names of assays and manufacturers.
comments could be made about each test and more
information could be added if some details had been
overlooked. the physicians then were asked to choose
antithyroid drugs (atd), surgery or radioiodine as their
basic treatment approach. for each treatment modality
there was a range of questions covering details on how
that specific treatment would be given.
a list of 12 variations to the case history then was
presented (table 2) and the physicians were asked
whether they would change their basic treatment
approach given for the initial case history. for each
variation they were asked to answer the same questions
about treatment.

did both a scintigram and ultrasound size. twentyseven per cent did neither a scintigram nor ultrasound.
the diagnostic use of these tests differed from country to

country (table 4).

the main reason for performing a scintigram or
ultrasound is to differentiate between graves' disease
and juvenile thyroiditis with transient thyrotoxicosis
and nodular goitre. however, the determination of
thyroid autoantibodies also might be helpful to clarify
the differential diagnosis. if no scintigram was performed,
28/59 would do tests for  xxxg2320xxx  antibodies
(anti-tpo-ab) whereas 23/40 would do both. a tsh
receptor antibody ( xxxg2341xxx -ab) assay was used routinely
by 36/59 who did not do a thyroid scintigram and by 25/
41 who did a scintigram. fourteen of the respondents did
neither  xxxg2341xxx -ab nor any of the three in vivo tests.
seventy-four per cent of the pediatricians and 74% of
the endocrinologists included bone age as routine
investigation, but only 36% of the internists.
other routine investigations. these comprised chest x-ray

in vitro diagnostic procedures (table 5). basal tsh was the
routine choice of 92% of respondents, and 32% also
would perform a trh test. either total t4 and/or free t4
were the routine investigations chosen by 99%, but only

two-thirds would include either total and/or free t3. the
most frequent thyroid autoantibody used routinely was
thyroglobulin antibody (tg-ab). sixteen per cent of
those measuring tg-ab did neither microsomal nor antitpo-ab. about two-thirds measured  xxxg2341xxx -ab. of the
different  xxxg2341xxx -ab assays, 13 were indicated to be
function stimulating, two function and growth stimu¬
lating, one receptor stimulating and inhibiting and two
receptor inhibiting. no major differences in the choice of
autoantibodies were found between the pediatricians,
endocrinologists and internists.

basic treatment of uncomplicated graves' disease. in 98
out of 99 questionnaires, the basic treatment chosen

for the patient in the case history was with atd. one
only chose radioiodine as the basic treatment. this
respondent commented that he had seen only two
cases during his whole career and that both had been
treated elsewhere before he saw them. the initial
treatment was  xxxd435xxx - xxxd2594xxx - xxxd2594xxx 
(cmt) for 83 respondents and  xxxd3036xxx  (ptu)
for the last 16. sixty-six per cent added beta-blockers
and another 8% would add beta-blockers only if the
hyperthyroidism was severe. only 4% would add
barbiturates and another 4% benzodiazepines. no
universal agreement on the initial cmt dose was
found, whereas most agreed on the same ptu dose
-day^ xxxd1338xxx ). in 21 responses a total
dose per day was given, rather than "mg kg-1 day",
and some even used a fixed dose despite weight and
age. in these 21 cases we calculated the dose in
mg·kg1 -day-1 from the weight given in the case
history (30 kg). the range of doses used are shown in
fig. 2.
the initial treatment was modified by 79% on the
basis of both clinical and laboratory criteria by 61/78.
however, 17 used laboratory data alone and nine used
clinical criteria alone. two different ways of modifying
treatment were chosen, either by adapting the initial
atd dose as the thyroid hormones normalized
("adapters") or by adding t4 to the treatment
("combiners"). three per cent indicated that they
would add t4 if the patient had a large goiter. as seen

variations to the original case story (table 8). eightythree per cent would choose surgery for the basic
treatment if the patient had an adenoma. other

surgical treatment was to obtain euthyroidism without

discussion
this paper summarizes the results of a questionnaire
study sent to 672 european physicians, all members of
either eta or espe, on management and therapy of
thyrotoxicosis in the pediatrie age groups. three
hundred members of both societies replied. many of
them never see patients and amongst the clinicians only
some had seen children with thyrotoxicosis. therefore,
only 99 out of the 300 members who replied could fill in
the questionnaire. we consider that the 99 positive

replies constitute a satisfactory response rate, particu¬
larly when compared with a previous questionnaire
study on the treatment and diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis

in adults conducted amongst eta members in 1985 in
which 100 responses were obtained (1).
the fact that 22 countries are represented is an
important point in our response profile. we did not
ask how many patients with thyrotoxicosis in childhood

the respondents had actually diagnosed and treated.
however, it is known that in many areas of the world
physicians correspond nationally on certain diseases
that are rarely seen. we consider, therefore, that our
results represent a reliable consensus on diagnosis and
treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood, although we
cannot discount the possibility of some under-reporting.
there was a consensus on treating the patients as
outpatients and also on using total t4 routinely as a

in many cases combined with free t4;
very few considered the t3 uptake test, or an equivalent
measure of protein binding, a useful routine investiga¬
tion. measurement of tsh also was the test of choice in
most cases, and one-third still considered a trh test to
be appropriate for routine use. the centers using this
approach were scattered around europe and it is
possible that some still have an insensitive tsh assay
for routine use. total t3 and/or free t3 also were used

by two-thirds of the responders. cases of t3 thyro¬
toxicosis have been reported in children (3) and a
measurement of t3 might, therefore, be recommended
for diagnosis. the diagnostic significance of routine
investigation of thyroid autoantibodies is debated. in
childhood thyrotoxicosis the physician needs to dis¬
tinguish between graves' disease and autoimmune
thyroiditis with transient thyrotoxicosis (4). thus,
 xxxg2341xxx -ab may be of some help but is probably only
positive in about 80% of subjects with newly diagnosed

graves' disease. the almost universal use of tg-ab,
which has been shown to provide less information than
anti-tpo-ab (5), was surprising, whereas only 50%
measured anti-tpo-ab. however, even the anti-tpo-ab
titers seem of debatable diagnostic significance because
patients with childhood graves' disease also have high
positive anti-tpo-ab titers (l lavard, h perrild, brock
jacobsen and m hoier-madsen pers. comm.). the
widespread use of the old methods for measuring
microsomal antibodies is intriguing.
the responses on the use of in vivo diagnostic tests
reflect the increasing use of ultrasound in some
countries, especially germany and italy. a routine
scintigram still has its advocates. the uk respondents
reported very limited use of in vivo diagnostic tests,
whereas the german respondents often used all the
alternatives routinely. ultrasound studies also may be of
diagnostic value for excluding nodules that might be
autonomous—although very rare in children—and
for measuring the thyroid size, which might be of
prognostic value, but there are no prospective studies to

compared to those given cmt (l lavard, h perrild and
brock jacobsen, pers. comm.). there was no consensus
on whether to adapt the dose or combine it with t4 and
there was no agreement on the duration of treatment.
investigating these variables could be the objectives of a
prospective study. no consensus was reached as to
what criteria should be used for stopping treatment. the

limited use of  xxxg2341xxx -ab for this purpose also is the
conclusion in a recent european meta analysis (8), but
the data were obtained predominantly from adults. a
proper evaluation of the significance of changes in
thyroid autoantibodies in children with thyrotoxicosis
also must await a prospective study, as childhood
thyrotoxicosis probably is a special disease entity.
radioiodine treatment of thyrotoxicosis in children
has its strong advocates in the usa (9). in europe,
radioiodine is the treatment of choice in adults with
multinodular goiter (1). in this study, 22 out of 99
physicians from nine countries would consider radio¬
iodine treatment as the treatment of choice for children
with recurrent thyrotoxicosis after surgery, or with
recurrent thyrotoxicosis 2 years after atd. however,
radioiodine is preferred by only a small percentage of
physicians for this group of patients in europe. hardly
any of the respondents chose radioiodine for the
patients with a toxic adenoma or a multinodular toxic

the 1985 eta survey. in adults, 22% favored radio¬
iodine as the initial treatment for an adult patient with
moderate graves' disease. the atd were given in doses
similar to those indicated for
children and for a fixed period, most frequently 12-24
months. an adult with a large goiter would be treated
surgically by 51% as the initial treatment compared to
16% of the children. radioiodine was preferred by 17%
as the initial treatment for an adult with a large goiter.
surgery was not often a primary therapeutic option
for adults in europe, apart from patients with large
goiters. even after recurrence after atd, only 10%
would choose surgery. adults with recurrences 2 years
after atd treatment and 4 years after surgery were
treated with radioiodine by 64% and 77% of responders,
respectively. no data on nodular goiters or adenomas in
adults are included in the eta survey, but radioiodine
must be expected to be used as frequently in
hyperthyroid adults with these diseases as for patients
with graves' disease. in children, surgery seems to be

after surgery is high in children (4,10) and it is a matter
of concern that so few countries have a centralized
surgical service for children with thyrotoxicosis,
especially when the general approach by many is to
obtain a near-total thyroidectomy, with a statistically
increased risk of complications. the debate on the use of
radioiodine, possibly in an ablative dose, to avoid any
risk of thyroid cancer and to avoid recurrence is still
open. the responses were generally no different
whether the respondents were pediatricians, inter¬
nists, surgeons or endocrinologists.
it is of interest to compare the results of the present
study with the eta survey on thyrotoxicosis in adults

acknowledgments. we especially thank the secretary of espe, professor
wg sippell and professors g hennemann and a burger (eta) for their
help in setting up the study. kodak (uk) sponsored the clinical
symposium on "thyrotoxicosis in childhood" at the eta conference
in cardiff 1993, and novo nordisk denmark sponsored distribution of
the questionnaire.
