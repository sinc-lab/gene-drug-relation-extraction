background: portal hypertension is a clinically important consequence of
cirrhosis that can lead to morbidities such as variceal bleeding, hepatic
encephalopathy and ascites. all of these outcomes carry high mortality rates.
there have been several drugs created to assist with endoscopic therapy for
the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. recently,  xxxd3491xxx  has been
studied in patients to evaluate its efficacy as treatment for acute variceal
hemorrhage. although no comparisons have been made between  xxxd3491xxx 
and other somatostatin analogues, this drug has been shown to have efficacy
in the control of acute variceal bleeding as well as reducing the risk of recurrent
bleeding and death, especially when started prior to endoscopy. objective:
this paper reviews the literature regarding the basic science and clinical
efficacy of  xxxd3491xxx  in acute variceal bleeding. methods: we used a pubmed/
medline search in order to review the literature regarding the drug,  xxxd3491xxx . results/conclusions:  xxxd3491xxx  appears to have benefit in the control
of acute variceal bleeding. it is easy to administer and has few side effects,
which are minor. these findings endorse the need for future trials to evaluate
 xxxd3491xxx  and its use in acute variceal hemorrhage, a morbidity among
patients with cirrhosis.

introduction

portal hypertension is defined as elevated pressure within the portal vein and its
tributaries. in north america and europe, the most common cause of portal
hypertension is cirrhosis, which is most frequently due to hepatitis c (hcv). other
less common etiologies include portal vein thrombosis, budd–chiari syndrome
and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. a serious consequence of portal hypertension,
with a high associated mortality rate, is acute variceal bleeding. the most important
aspect of managing a patient with acute variceal bleeding is immediate initial
control of hemorrhage and the prevention of recurrent bleeding [1]. the current
standard of therapy is the combination of endoscopic treatment and administration
of vasoactive drugs, including somatostatin and its analogues as well as vasopressin
and  xxxd3318xxx . the management of variceal bleeding, which occurs in about
one-third of patients with cirrhosis, has become a clinically important topic due
to associated mortality rates as high as 30 – 50% [2-5]. however, in recent years
there has been a significant risk reduction of 5 – 25% that is associated with
improved patient management. despite appropriate therapy, nearly 25% of deaths
occur in the early bleeding period. hence, there is a demand for development of
faster and more targeted therapies aimed at providing assistance during the early
phases of variceal hemorrhage [6].  xxxd3491xxx  mimics the hormone somatostatin,
and has been studied in the early treatment of variceal hemorrhage (box 1) [7]. in

addition to similar efficacies, possible advantages for using
 xxxd3491xxx  compared with other agents include longer duration
of action and stability at room temperature for storage. a
review of the studies involving  xxxd3491xxx  for the management
of acute variceal bleeding is reported in this paper.
2.

overview of the market

management of acute variceal bleeding entails achieving
hemostasis [8]. currently, methods to control variceal bleeding
include endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy, surgical
shunt or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, balloon
tamponade, and vasoactive drug administration. the most
common initial treatment approach is administration of a
vasoactive drug (either  xxxd3318xxx  or vasopressin or a somatostatin analogue) at the time of admission, followed by
endoscopic treatment [9-11]. previously, sclerotherapy was the
primary endoscopic treatment for control of variceal hemorrhage. however, after the demonstration of improved efficacy,
endoscopic band ligation (ebl) has evolved as the preferred
endoscopic therapy [12].
direct vasoconstrictors, such as vasopressin and  xxxd3318xxx ,
have been used in the management of variceal hemorrhage.
their mechanism of action is mesenteric vasoconstriction
resulting in the decrease of portal blood flow and reduction of
variceal pressure. however these drugs, specifically vasopressin,
can cause systemic vasoconstriction, which in turn may lead
to organ hypoperfusion manifested by significant adverse effects
including cardiac, brain or intestinal ischemia. another drug
2338

class used in the setting of acute variceal hemorrhage includes
somatostatin and its analogues. although their mechanism of
action is not completely understood, these agents reduce portal
blood flow and pressure through the inhibition of vasodilatory
hormones such as glucagon,  xxxg2240xxx , calcitonin gene-related
peptide, and  xxxg2417xxx  [11,13,14].
the hospitalization and mortality rate for variceal bleeding
has been decreasing over time [15]. in fact, the hospitalization
rate for bleeding esophageal varices decreased by 15% in
2000 compared with 1990. one possible explanation for
this phenomenon is primary prophylaxis for esophageal
varices using oral beta-blockers and ebl, because over a
similar time period the treatment of outpatient non-bleeding
varices increased by 55% [16]. nevertheless, acute variceal
bleeding is a major cause of mortality for cirrhotic patients.
therefore, there is still a necessity to discover effective,
cheaper and targeted therapies in order to decrease mortality
and morbidity.  xxxd3491xxx  has potential to fill this void
given its similar efficacy when compared to other vasoactive
agents, but has a longer duration of action and can be
stored at room temperature.

introduction to the compound

 xxxd3491xxx  ( xxxd3491xxx ®,  xxxd3491xxx ® ir,  xxxd3491xxx , bmy 41606)
is a cyclic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin developed by
the debiopharm group (lausanne, switzerland). studies have
shown in rat models of cirrhosis that administration of
 xxxd3491xxx  and octreotide resulted in reduction of splanchnic

fortune, jackson, leonard & trotter

blood flow and portal flow without affecting systemic blood
flow [17-20]. other reports investigating the effects of somatostatin analogues using in vitro and animal models have
shown that  xxxd3491xxx , compared with other analogues, has
more potent inhibition of growth hormone release, gastric
acid secretion and bicarbonate secretion [21-24]. human studies
will be discussed in another section.

chemistry

based on a recently published review,  xxxd3491xxx  was produced
by substituting along the peptide chain of somatostatin (a native
14 amino acid peptide) down to a cyclic 8-amino acid analogue [21].  xxxd3491xxx  is a white lyophilisate that is reconstituted
with  xxxd3213xxx  prior to injection or infusion.
5.

pharmacokinetics

 xxxd3491xxx  is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring
hypothalamic hormone, somatostatin. somatostatin inhibits
the secretion of vasodilatory peptides from the gastrointestinal
tract, including glucagon, which has been shown to contribute
to the maintenance of portal hypertension. while natural
somatostatin has a very short half-life (3 min), the elimination half-life of  xxxd3491xxx  is reported to be approximately 10 times longer than that of its parent compound
(30 min) [2]. although the exact mechanisms of action in
variceal bleeding are unknown, somatostatin and its analogues
appear to cause indirect splanchnic vasoconstriction and
decrease portal inflow through inhibition of multiple vasodilatory peptides [21]. results from various pharmacokinetic
studies have shown rapid elimination of  xxxd3491xxx 
following a single intravenous injection in both healthy
volunteers and patients with liver and renal impairment.
when given as a continuous infusion,  xxxd3491xxx  plasma
concentration and clearance at steady state were similar to
values estimated following a single intravenous injection,
suggesting first-order kinetics [21].
6.

pharmacodynamics and metabolism

pharmacodynamic studies of healthy volunteers demonstrated
suppression of gastric acid secretion and inhibition of the
secretion of pancreatic enzyme, which is similar to somatostatin [21]. portal hypertension rat models showed significant
decrease in portal pressure and collateral flow after administration of  xxxd3491xxx , providing a potential mechanism for its
effect on variceal pressure [20].  xxxd3491xxx  binds with high
affinity to somatostatin-receptor subtypes 2 and 5 and, unlike
octreotide, also has intermediate affinity for subtype 4 [25,26].
 xxxd3491xxx  is rapidly metabolized to its main metabolite,
des-[trp8-nh2]- xxxd3491xxx , which does not bind to
somatostatin receptors and is eliminated predominantly in
bile (76%), with the remainder eliminated through the
kidney. biliary products of elimination are degraded in the

gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the formation of single
amino acids that are subsequently absorbed through the
intestines. it is the only somatostatin analogue that is stable
at room temperature for extended periods of time [21].
7.

clinical efficacy

the pivotal clinical study for  xxxd3491xxx  was performed as a
large randomized, double-blinded trial using the somatostatin
analogue prior to endoscopic therapy. this phase iii trial
involved 227 patients with cirrhosis from 22 centers who
were hospitalized for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
treatment groups were randomized to either  xxxd3491xxx  plus
endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or banding, based on
physician preference) or endoscopic therapy plus placebo [2].
 xxxd3491xxx  was given (as a 50-mug bolus followed by infusion
at a rate of 50 mug/h for 5 days) prior to endoscopy in the
study group versus placebo given to the control group. the
average time between initiation of infusion of  xxxd3491xxx  or
placebo and endoscopy was 2.6 ± 3.3 h. the primary end
point was the control of bleeding and survival after 5 days,
which was the same primary end point used in other somatostatin analogue trials [27-30]. control of bleeding was assessed
using the baveno consensus guidelines [31]. secondary end
points were control of bleeding at the time of initial endoscopy, control of bleeding 6 h after randomization, the number
of units of blood given during the 5 days of treatment, the
incidence of late recurrence of bleeding (occurring during
day 6 – 42), and survival at day 42.
regarding the primary end points, control of bleeding and
survival in the first 5 days was significantly greater with
 xxxd3491xxx  than placebo (66 vs 50%, p = 0.02). with regard
to the secondary end points, control of bleeding at time of
endoscopy was greater in the  xxxd3491xxx  group over the control group (64 vs 51%, p = 0.03). control of bleeding at
6 h after randomization was also greater in the  xxxd3491xxx 
group (p = 0.001), and the number of units of blood given
was fewer in the  xxxd3491xxx  group than placebo group with
2.0 ± 2.2 versus 2.8 ± 2.8 units (p = 0.04). the secondary end
points provide important information that with better control
of bleeding at time of endoscopy, visualization and effective
application of treatment may be subjectively optimized and
therefore more likely to decrease re-bleeding. also, lower blood
requirements may improve patient survival and decrease
risk of transfusion-related complications, such as acute lung
injury [32,33]. however, there was no significant difference in
42-day survival or re-bleeding rates. in addition, some investigators have been critical of the pivotal  xxxd3491xxx  study
because of its use of combined primary end points. their
arguments were that if both end points were separated, then
neither one would be statistically significant [7].
one meta-analysis was created using the  xxxd3491xxx  data from
the pivotal trial and three additional unpublished pharmaceutical phase iii trials. these analyses compared combination
with endoscopy and  xxxd3491xxx  versus endoscopy alone using

 xxxd3491xxx 

similar primary end points (control of bleeding and survival
at day 5) [2,21,34]. integrating a collection of 623 patients,
the meta-analysis revealed an overall odds ratio for use of
 xxxd3491xxx  at 1.51 (95% confidence interval [ci]; 1.07 – 2.13,
p = 0.02). however, these results cannot provide strong support for the use of  xxxd3491xxx . the additional phase iii trials
were unpublished trials performed by the pharmaceutical
company itself; hence, we would recommend only the study by
cales and colleagues [2] as the acceptable supporting evidence
for  xxxd3491xxx ’s use in acute variceal bleeding.
another meta-analysis was performed in order to further
investigate the efficacy of using natural somatostatin and its
synthetic analogues in combination with endoscopic therapy
in acute variceal hemorrhage [35].  xxxd3491xxx  as included in
this meta-analysis assessing whether vasoactive drugs improve
control of acute variceal bleeding and increase survival
rates [2]. there were four other peer-reviewed trials and
three abstracts included in this meta-analysis. these studies
reviewed the efficacy of octreotide and somatostatin [27,30,36-38].
all trials used the same primary end points: initial hemostasis, 5-day hemostasis, and 5-day mortality. initial control of
bleeding was achieved in 88% of patients treated with
endoscopy plus vasoactive drug and in 76% of those treated
with endoscopy alone (overall rr 1.12, 95% ci: 1.02 – 1.23,
test for heterogeneity, p = 0.094). five-day hemostasis was
achieved in 77% treated with endoscopy plus vasoactive drug
and in 58% treated with endoscopy alone (overall rr 1.28,
95% ci: 1.18 – 1.39). the number needed to treat was
calculated to be eight for 5-day hemorrhage control and five
for 5-day survival. however, five-day mortality was not found
to be significantly reduced by combining endoscopy with
drug therapy based on an overall relative risk of 0.73 (95%
ci: 0.45 – 1.18, test for homogeneity, p = 0.96) [35]. hence,
with the exception of the study by cales and co-workers [2],
no major trial has been performed to reproduce clinical efficacy for  xxxd3491xxx  in the early control of acute variceal
bleeding. however, a collection of centers in the united
states has initiated a study to further investigate  xxxd3491xxx  [39]
and may provide further information regarding  xxxd3491xxx ’s
clinical potential.

safety and tolerability

adverse effects that occurred in the  xxxd3491xxx  trials were
generally mild and primarily included gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations of the gastrointestinal hormonal system.
these events included imbalances of glucagon, insulin, growth
hormone levels, and alterations with the gastrointestinal secretory hormones. symptoms consisted mostly of diarrhea, loose
stools, nausea and abdominal discomfort as well as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. the safety profile for  xxxd3491xxx 
was reviewed from the pharmaceutical studies as well as the
initial phase iii trials [2,21,35]. the majority of the studies
used 1.2 mg daily dosing and the remainder used 1.5 mg/day.
abstracted from the variceal bleeding trials, adverse events
2340

occurred no more frequently with  xxxd3491xxx  infusion than
with placebo (p = 1.0). the only adverse effects to occur in
> 5% of treated patients were consistent with the complications of patients’ cirrhosis, including hepatic encephalopathy,
esophageal variceal hemorrhage and esophageal ulcer. when
compared with the placebo group, the rates of similar adverse
events were not statistically different [2]. in addition, the  xxxd3491xxx  meta-analysis revealed that hyperglycemia occurred
more frequently among those treated with  xxxd3491xxx  [34],
octreotide [28] and somatostatin [30] than in placebo [35]. it is
not known whether  xxxd3491xxx  is excreted into human breast
milk or if it has teratogenicity.
in studies using  xxxd3491xxx  for other indications, observed
adverse reactions included leukopenia, neutropenia, fatigue,
headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
in patients treated for metastatic breast cancer [21]. diarrhea,
vomiting and anorexia have occurred in those treated with
 xxxd3491xxx  for pancreatic cancer [40]. steatorrhea has occurred in
patients treated with  xxxd3491xxx  for aids-related diarrhea [41].
9.

regulatory affairs

 xxxd3491xxx  is currently under review by drug regulation
agencies of north america and europe for the use in
acute variceal hemorrhage. postmarketing surveillance is not
applicable at this time, as  xxxd3491xxx  is in the final stages
of review.
10.

conclusion

acute variceal bleeding remains as a major clinical cause of
morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and portal
hypertension. continued efforts are being made to optimize
our universal management of these patients so that outcomes
are improved and healthcare costs are reduced. there have been
considerable advances made in this field, which have increased
survival and decreased recurrence of hemorrhage [21]. new
strategies consisting of volume resuscitation, prophylactic
antibiotics, and combination of vasoactive drug therapy with
endoscopic therapy have probably led to these results [2]. it
has been accepted that drug therapy should be administered
immediately upon admission and adequate resuscitation performed prior to endoscopy and continued for 2 – 5 days [21].
 xxxd3491xxx  has demonstrated efficacy in the early management
of acute variceal hemorrhage, but only based on combined
primary end points of hemostasis and survival after 5 days.
in addition,  xxxd3491xxx ’s efficacy is limited to only one major
study performed in europe and not yet in the united states.
although it did not show significant reduction in mortality,
 xxxd3491xxx ’s observed effect on hemostasis, as well as its favorable safety profile, make it an potential option for vasoactive
therapy in acute variceal bleeding. future studies will need
to be developed in order to understand the clinical role of
 xxxd3491xxx  in this very difficult clinical setting. it will be
of great interest to see results acquired from a recently

expert opinion

the treatment of portal hypertension and its sequelae continues
to be a field of research development in order to improve
the management of cirrhotic patients. currently, none of the
commonly administered intravenous agents used in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding in the united states (vasopressin,  xxxd3318xxx , octreotide, etc.) are fda-approved for
this indication. in the summer of 2008, a north american
phase iii trial was completed in support of registration of
 xxxd3491xxx  for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding in the
united states [39]. should  xxxd3491xxx  by approved by the
fda for this indication, its use in the united states might
expand. the benefits of somatostatin analogues include their

favorable safety profile and few contraindications. these
benefits are in contrast to the less tolerable safety profile of
vasopressin.  xxxd3491xxx  could provide another effective option
to hospitals and endoscopists for use in patients with acute
variceal bleeding. specific advantages for  xxxd3491xxx  over
other somatostatin analogues include its stability at room
temperature (making it easier for storage), as well as its longer
duration of action. this drug could be provided in any setting,
whether given by emergency medical services or a hospital
of any size; thus providing another option to assist in acute
variceal bleeding.
