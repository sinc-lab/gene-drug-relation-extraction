receptors (aar) may involve a
decrease in synthesis, an increase in degradation, or a combination of the two mechanisms.
norepinephrine
(ne) causes
downregulation
of aar in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells
(rbsmc). to study the role of receptor degradation
in this
phenomenon,
we studied the half-life (tl,z) of the aar under
basal conditions and during exposure to ne. we first determined the disappearance
rate of aar in the presence of
cycloheximide,
a commonly used method for measuring receptor tli2. by this approach, the basal t112 was surprisingly
long,
cells was 11.8 *
172 t 20 h. in contrast, the t 1i2 in ne-treated
0.3 h, suggesting that either ne decreased the t1,2 of aar or
cycloheximide
increased the basal tl,z. to distinguish
these
possibilities,
basal receptor tli2 was determined
by a second,
independent
method based on the repopulation
of aar after
irreversible
alkylation
with chloroethylclonidine.
this approach indicated a basal t ii2 (7.4 t 0.2 h) that was similar to
the tl12 with ne but more than 20-fold shorter than the tl12
with cycloheximide.
we conclude that in rbsmc ne-induced
downregulation
of aar occurs without a decrease in receptor
tli2. the unexpected
finding that cycloheximide
markedly
increases the basal t l/2 of the aar further indicates that the
tl,2 of the aar is regulated, at least in part, by a short-lived
protein that may regulate and/or mediate receptor degradation.

density in response to agonist stimulation is an increase
in the degradation rate of the receptor.
in smooth muscle cells obtained from the rabbit aorta
(rbsmc), ne exposure over a period of 24 h causes a
marked decrease in the density of aar (6, 23), with a
50% reduction in receptor density at - 11 h (13). we
have shown that this agonist-induced downregulation of
aar density is associated with an - 80% decrease in
mrna steady-state level (13) due to a protein kinase
c-mediated decrease in mrna stability (14). although
this finding might suggest that ne may cause aar
downregulation at the mrna level, there is no information about the effect of ne on aar degradation in these
cells.
the present experiments were undertaken to determine the potential roles of altered aar synthesis and
degradation in the process of ne-induced aar downregulation in rbsmc. we hypothesized that a decrease
in the rate of aar synthesis, as suggested by the marked
decrease in mrna level, is a major factor in ne-induced
downregulation of aar in rbsmc. this explanation
would require that the degradation rate for the aar be
relatively rapid, with a basal receptor tl12 similar to the
observed time course of ne-induced aar downregulation (i.e., on the order of 11 h).
as the initial approach to this issue, we determined
the hi2 of the rbsmc aar under basal conditions by
chloroethylclonidine;
cycloheximide;
rabbit aorta
measuring the rate of total cellular aar disappearance
in the presence of cycloheximide to block new receptor
synthesis. using this approach, hughes and insel (12)
have shown in b&h1 cells that the basal t112for aar is

the recovery of aar after washout of ne was abolished

basal tli2 based on inhibition of protein synthesis. a
standard approach for the assessment of basal receptor
tli2 is to determine the rate of receptor loss in the
presence of cycloheximide to block new receptor synthesis (19). under these conditions, receptor density should
decrease by first-order kinetics as described in eq. 1.
the addition of cycloheximide (5 pg/ml) to rbsmc
resulted in a slow decrease in aar density over 72 h,
with a tliz of 172 t 20 h (r = 0.901, p < 0.001, n = 4;
fig. 2). this tliz is surprisingly long and exceeds by
several fold the t112values for aar determined in ddt1
mf-2 ( - 7 h) or b&h1 (- 24 h; 12, 21). a potential
trivial explanation for the long t1,2 observed with cycloheximide is that the concentration used in these experiments was not adequate to inhibit aar synthesis fully.
however, we found that this concentration of cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis, as assessedby [3h]leutine incorporation, by > 95% without adversely affecting cell viability for up to 3 days (data not shown).

basal aar tli2 based on receptor repopulation. another possibility is that cycloheximide affects the tii2 of
the aar. a second approach to the determination of
receptor tii2 is based on the assumption that under
steady-state conditions the rates of receptor synthesis
and degradation must be equal. if this reasonable
assumption is true, the basal tii2 of aar can be determined by measuring the rate of appearance of new
receptors after irreversible alkylation of existing receptors (19).
assuming first-order degradation of receptors, rt, the
amount of receptor at time, t, can be described by

agreement with the tl/2 based on the disappearance rate
of aar with cycloheximide in the same cells (12).
in rbsmc, we utilized cec, an alkalizing agent that
selectively and irreversibly inactivates cc-adrenergic receptors of the 1b subtype (10, 22). cec reduced aar

’ the tliz in the presence of cycloheximide
(172 h) was

longer than the tilz derived by the receptor
repopulation
method (7.4 h). there are two possible
explanations for this discrepancy. one possibility is that
cec exposure,
per se, leads to an increase in the
synthesis
rate of aar. to address this possibility,
the
level of aar mrna was examined 1) in rbsmc exposed
to cec (10 pm, 20 min) and washed as per the binding
experiments
and 2) in control rbsmc not exposed to
cec but washed as per the binding experiments.
under
these conditions, cec exposure had no effect (n = 5) on
aar mrna levels compared with washed cells not
exposed to cec (fig. 5). however, the washing protocol,
per se, caused a 16 + 10% increase in a4r mrna level
over 8 h in both cec-treated
and washed control cells,
compared with unwashed control cells (n = 4). to determine the significance of this washing-induced
increase
in mrna level, binding experiments
were performed in
unwashed control cells and control cells washed as per
the cec-washout
protocol. washing caused a 16 +- 5%
(p < 0.05, n = 7) increase in aar density at 24 h,
compared with unwashed control cells. thus, although
washing causes an increase in aar synthesis rate, the
magnitude of this effect is small, and it would have a
minimal effect on the observed recovery rate of aar
after cec exposure. it is also possible that the cec
method underestimated
the apparent receptor synthesis
rate due to retention of cec in the media and/or on the
cell surface after washing, thus masking the true rate of
receptor reappearance. to examine this possibility, cells
were incubated with cec (10 fm) for 4 h, and the media
containing cec was transferred
to a second culture dish
for 20 min. under these conditions, the cec-containing
media caused only a 3 + 3% (n = 4) decrease in aar
density as measured by [3h] xxxd3000xxx 
binding.
a second explanation, which we favor, for the discrepancy in tliz determined
by cec and cycloheximide
is
that cycloheximide
causes a prolongation
of aar tlia
under basal conditions. this explanation would suggest
that inhibition of protein synthesis stabilizes the receptor and/or decreases the activity of a protein(s) involved
in degradation of the receptor. a similar prolongation
of
basal tliz has also been observed for estrogen receptors
in cultured uterine cells (1) and insulin receptors
in
fibroblasts
(15, 16). this observation,
however, is novel
with regard to aar, or adrenergic receptors, in general.
our data do not allow a precise determination
of the
time course of this effect. however, from inspection of
fig. 2 it can be deduced that the protein(s)
involved
must be relatively short lived.
if, as suggested by these data, ne causes downregulation of aar by a decrease in receptor synthesis
rather
than an increase in degradation,
the effect of ne on
receptor
density should be abolished when receptor
synthesis
is blocked by cycloheximide.

receptor

mined by the receptor-repopulation
technique is similar
to the tlib observed in the presence of ne (i.e., 7.4 and
11.8 h, respectively),
thereby indicating that a decrease
in receptor stability is not associated with the initial
effect of ne. we have also been unable to demonstrate
a
ne-induced
change in the proportion
of surface-tononsurface
aar in intact rbsmc assayed at 4°c or by
cell fractionation
techniques
(unpublished
data). by
contrast, using these approaches we (4) and others (8)
have been able to demonstrate
a clear ne-induced
translocation
of aar in dtt, mf-2 cells. thus these
data support the hypothesis that a decrease in receptor
synthesis may be the major mechanism responsible for
the first several hours of agonist-induced
downregulation of aar in rbsmc. it should be noted, however,
that our data do not exclude a potential role for a change
in receptor tli2 at later times (e.g., > 24 h).
it is of interest to compare these findings in rbsmc to
those reported in ddtl mf-2 cells. in ddti mf-2 cells,
morris et al. (21) found that epinephrine
causes an
- 60% decrease in aar density at a time when mrna
steady-state
levels were increased
by - 40%, thus
strongly suggesting that the decrease in receptor density
was due to an increase in receptor degradation. of note,
they also found that the basal tli2 of &jr mrna (- 7 h)
in ddtl mf-2 cells was not affected by exposure to
epinephrine.
hu et al. (11) have recently shown that
activation
of protein kinase c in ddtl mf-2 cells
induces the expression of the aar mrna. these effects
of ne and phorbol esters are in further contrast to our
observations
in rbsmc that both ne and phorbol esters
decrease the tl,2 of aar mrna (13, 14).
taken together,
it appears that changes in both
synthesis and degradation can be involved in the regulation of aar expression by agonist and that the relative
importance of changes in synthesis vs. degradation may
be species- and/or tissue-dependent.
we suggest that a
comparison
of ddti mf-2 and rbsmc may yield further insight regarding the structural
determinants
of
the stability of both the aar receptor and its mrna and
the modulation of receptor and mrna stability by ne.
