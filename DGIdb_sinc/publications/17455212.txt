 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  receptor gene variants have been
associated with clinical aspects of schizophrenia;
however only specific features were analyzed in
different samples. to assess the complex interaction between genetic and clinical factors, we
studied the possible cross-interactions between
 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms, symptomatology of schizophrenia
and schizoaffective disorders, and the occurrence
of treatment induced side effects taking into
consideration possible clinical confounding variables. one hundred thirty one outpatients in
stable remission meeting the dsmiv criteria for
schizophrenia spectrum disorders and receiving
long-term maintenance therapy with haloperidol,
fluphenazine, zuclopenthixole, or risperidone were
genotyped for  xxxg655xxx  a-48g,  xxxg656xxx  ins-141cdel,
and  xxxg656xxx  ser311cys polymorphisms. psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the
positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia (panss). extrapyramidal side effects
were assessed with the simpson–angus extrapyramidal side effects scale (eps), the barnes akathisia scale (bars), and the abnormal involuntary
movement scale (aims). drug dosage was
included as covariant because it was associated
with the severity of symptomatology, akathisia,
and parkinsonism. no association was observed
for  xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms and extrapyramidal side effects, or with the other clinical
variables considered. our study suggests that
 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  variants are not liability factors
for tardive dyskinesia.

introduction
schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disturbance that
recognizes a strong genetic predisposition [sanders et al.,
2004; abdolmaleky et al., 2005]. despite decades of investigation no unequivocal liability gene has been identified except for
some evidence that a few genes in particular may be involved
[benson et al., 2004; corfas et al., 2004; owen et al., 2004;
maier et al., 2005]. different approaches had been applied to
identify some liability genes that could influence specific
symptomatology of schizophrenia [shinkai et al., 2000; serretti
et al., 2000a, 2000b; himei et al., 2002; pae et al., 2003; strous
et al., in press], treatment outcomes [arranz et al., 1995, 2000;
malhotra et al., 2004; lane et al., 2005], and extrapyramidal
side effects [segman et al., 1997, 1999, 2001], with different
results. strong mutual correlations exist between the clinical
factors: drug dose can influence symptomatology and side
effects [mossman, 1997]; side effects such as tardive dyskinesia
are influenced by the age of the subject and duration of
treatment and so on [jeste and caligiuri, 1993]. therefore in
order to better assess the complex interaction between genetic
and clinical factors mutually correlated, a comprehensive
assessment is needed.
dopamine system, especially dopamin d1 and d2 receptors,
are one of the main focuses of investigation. disturbances of
dopamine mediated transmission are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and dopamine receptors are important targets of the antipsychotic treatment. neuroimaging
studies have indeed confirmed that the antagonism of d2
receptor in the striatum is responsible for the occurrence of
acute eps [farde et al., 1992].
as the density of the  xxxg656xxx  is infuenced by the genetic
polymorphism of the dopamine d2-receptor gene ( xxxg656xxx )
[jonsson et al., 1999], the effects of the antipsychotic drugs
that are antagonists of this receptor may be modulated by its
polymorphisms [scharfetter, 2001]. several polymorphisms
have been detected in  xxxg656xxx  gene, including two putative
functional polymorphisms: a cytosine insertion/deletion variant located in the promoter region at position 141 (141c
ins/del), and the polymorphism at the position 311 in exon 7
leading to the substitution of serine with cysteine (ser311cys)
[itokawa et al., 1993; arinami et al., 1997].  xxxg656xxx  311 ser/cys

dolžan et al.

variant was associated both with the clinical symptoms of
schizophrenia [himei et al., 2002; lane et al., 2004], in
particular with delusions and symptoms of disorganization
[serretti et al., 1998, 2000a] and with the efficacy of the
antipsychotic treatments [lane et al., 2005], but not with the
extrapyramidal side effects [kaiser et al., 2002; chong et al.,
2003; segman et al., 2003]. on the contrary, the associations of
the  xxxg656xxx  141c ins/del polymorphism with the clinical
characteristics were not so conclusive—some studies found the
associations and others did not regarding either the symptomatology [ohara et al., 1998; himei et al., 2002], treatment
efficacy [arranz et al., 1998; scharfetter, 2004; wu et al., 2005],
or extrapyramidal side effects [mihara et al., 2001; nakazono
et al., 2005].
besides d2 receptors, d1 receptors may also be involved in
the symptomatology of schizophrenia and in antipsychotics’
efficacy. as systematic screening for mutations identified no
sequence changes in the coding region of the  xxxg655xxx  gene [feng
et al., 1998] and the single base substitutions identified in the
50 -upstream regulatory region (50 -utr) were not located in
regions that could have important influence on the level of
transcriptional activity [cichon et al., 1996] it was long
considered unlikely that  xxxg655xxx  gene, in particular its mostly
studied a-48g (ddei) polymorphism, would play a major role in
the genetic predisposition to either schizophrenia or bipolar
affective disorder. also no association was found between the
severity of main symptoms of schizophrenia and the ddei
polymorphism in the 50 -utr of the dopamine  xxxg655xxx  in
japan [kojima et al., 1999]  xxxg655xxx  genetic variants were
not associated with visual hallucinations in parkinson disease
[goetz et al., 2001]. new evidence that  xxxg655xxx  polymorphism
may be of functional importance came from positron emission
tomography studies during which significant regional brain
metabolic effects and involvement in clinical response to
clozapine were observed for the  xxxg655xxx  48gg genotype
[potkin et al., 2003]. clinical evidence was demonstrated only
recently with a finding of association between  xxxg655xxx  48gg
genotype and worse performance on prefrontal cortex test in
schizophrenia patients [rybakowski et al., 2005].
though many evidence has been reported for the involvement of  xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  receptor polymorphism in the clinical
aspects of schizophrenia, we realized that only individual
features were analyzed in each study; as an example  xxxg656xxx 
gene variants have been associated with symptomatology,
efficacy, and side effects but in different samples. as it is known
that these features are correlated, not considering them jointly
may lead to spurious associations.
a comprehensive assessment taking into account the
treatment, symptomatology, and side effects has never been
reported and it would be useful to detect gene effects given that
it has been recently suggested that gene variants have a small
but broad effect on complex traits [sanders et al., 2004; chotai
et al., 2005; kendler, 2005; serretti et al., in press].
we have gathered a large amount of clinical information on
slovenian outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder in stable remission, receiving long-term maintenance
antipsychotic treatment that would allow such comprehensive
analysis. in our previous study, we focused on the association of
genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome p450 cyp2d6 involved
in the metabolism of antipsychotic drugs with psychopathological symptoms and the occurrence of eps [kores plesnicar
et al., 2006].
in the present study, we have used this well-documented
group of patients to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of
 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  influence the symptomatology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and the occurrence of treatment
induced side effects taking into consideration possible clinical
confounding variables. this enabled us to study the possible
cross-interactions between the symptomatology and extrapyr-

amidal side effects in patients in stable remission and receiving
long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment.
patients and methods
patients and clinical ratings
all of the patients were of slovenian caucasian origin and
had clinically stabilized schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as defined by dsm iv criteria for schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder [american psychiatric association,
1994]. the patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic
population as they were coming for their regular monthly
check-ups. clinically stabilized schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder was the primary inclusion criteria. patients whose
medical history mentioned abuse of or dependence on psychoactive substances, patients with hepatic diseases, and those
receiving concomitant medication, with the exception of anticholinergic agents, were not included [kores plesnicar et al.,
2006]. at the end, from 151 eligible patients, the written
informed consent was obtained from 131 (55 males and 76
females), who were included in this study. the excluded
subjects did not significantly differ from the studied sample
regarding clinical and demographic features. the slovenian
ethics committee for research in medicine approved the study.
all patients had been receiving maintenance treatment with
antipsychotics that are known substrates of cyp2d6. they
had been receiving haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  (6%) 50–100 mg/4
weeks, oral fluphenazine (3.8%) 2.5–5 mg daily or fluphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  (16.8%) 25–50 mg/4 weeks, oral zuclopenthixole
(0.76%) 25–40 mg daily, or  xxxd3568xxx   xxxd1821xxx  (53%)
100–400 mg/4 weeks, oral tioridazine (1.52%) 50–100 mg daily
or oral risperidone (16%) 1–6 mg daily. in order to ensure
uniform doses for calculations, we converted them to chlorpromazine equivalents following published values [bazire,
2003; woods, 2003]. compliance was controlled by treating
clinicians.
patients were examined by an experienced psychiatrist who
was not aware of the results of the genotyping. psychopathological symptoms, their stability, and severity were assessed
with the use of the positive and negative syndrome scale for
schizophrenia (panss) [kay et al., 1987, 1989]: in the last
2 months no single item was supposed to increase by more than
one in any of the consecutive ratings; in the same period the
drug dosage was also supposed to be unaltered. scores from the
last assessment were used in the study.
tardive dyskinesia symptoms were assessed with the
abnormal involuntary movement scale (aims) [guy, 1976],
akathisia with the barnes akathisia scale (bars) [barnes,
1989] and parkinsonism with the simpson–angus extrapyramidal side effects (sas) [simpson and angus, 1970]. tardive
dyskinesia was diagnosed if at least ‘‘moderate’’ abnormal
involuntary movements in one or more of the seven body areas
or at least ‘‘mild’’ movements in two or more areas were present
[guy, 1976]. akathisia was diagnosed if a patient scored ‘‘mild’’
or worse on the global clinical assessment on the barnes scale. if
a patient had a total score of 0.3 or more on the simpson-angus
scale, parkinsonism was diagnosed [simpson and angus, 1970].
genotyping
genotyping of  xxxg655xxx  was performed by polymerase chain
reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis (pcr–rflp),
as described by sato et al. [sato et al., 2000]. after digestion of
amplified fragments of  xxxg655xxx  with ddei fragments of 146, 42,
and 217 bp were obtained in the presence of 48a allele and
146 and 259 bp for 48g allele. a total of 124 patients were
successfully genotyped for  xxxg655xxx .
 xxxg656xxx  del-141c ins alleles were identified by pcr–rflp
as described by arinami et al. [arinami et al., 1997]. after

 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms and long-term antipsychotic treatment

digestion of amplified fragments of  xxxg656xxx  promoter region with
bstni fragments of 160 and 144 bp were obtained in the
presence of 141c ins. as bstni recognition site was abolished
in the presence of 141c del, this allele was diagnosed by the
presence of the 304 bp uncut fragment. a total of 120 patients
were genotyped.
 xxxg656xxx  ser311cys alleles were identified by pcr–rflp as
described previously [arinami et al., 1997; dubertret et al.,
2004]. after digestion of amplified fragments with sau96i,
fragments of 126, 92, 53, and 23 bp were obtained in the
presence of 311ser allele. as one of the sau96i recognition sites
was abolished in the presence of 311cys, this allele was
diagnosed by the presence of the 149, 92, and 53 bp fragments.
all the genotyping was performed blind to patient’s clinical
status. in our sample, all genotypes were in hardy–weinberg
equilibrium ( xxxg655xxx  a-48g: w2 ¼ 2.24, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.13;  xxxg656xxx 
ins-141c del: w2 ¼ 1.35, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.25;  xxxg656xxx  ser311cys:
w2 ¼ 0.02, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.89). a total of 127 patients were
genotyped.
statistical analysis
all the analyses comparing categorical variables were
performed with the w2 test. associations between categorical
and continuous variables were tested with the t-test and the
one-way analysis of variance (anova), depending on the
nature of the independent variable. analysis of covariants
(ancova) was employed to weigh results for individuals’
dosages of drugs. correlations between continuous variables
were evaluated by the spearman r test. differences were
considered significant considering an alpha level of 0.017
(bonferroni correction: 0.05/3 polymorphisms).
with an alpha level of 0.017, in our sample we had a power of
0.80 to detect large effect sizes, corresponding to a difference of
approximately 0.8 points on delusional scores at the panss
between  xxxg655xxx  48ag variants (d ¼ 0.91); 1.6 points between
 xxxg656xxx  ser311cys genotypes on severity of abnormal involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia) (d ¼ 1.75); 0.55 points
between  xxxg656xxx  ins/del variants on severity of stereotypy(d ¼ 0.76) [cohen, 1988].
results
demographic and clinical data
demographic and clinical features of the sample are
illustrated in table i.

811

diagnostic subgroups in schizophrenia spectrum disorders
were not significantly different regarding demographic and
clinical features, such as sex, symptomatology (scores at the
panss), drugs, dosages (chlorpromazine equivalent), and
severity of extrapyramidal side effects (scores at the sas,
aims, and bars) (data not shown).
in our sample, positive symptoms (panss positive scale—
panssp) were more severe in males than in females (t ¼ 3.17,
df ¼ 129, p ¼ 0.0019) and depression (on the panss general
scale—panssg) positively correlated with age (r ¼ 0.25,
p ¼ 0.018), i.e., in older patients it was more severe than in
younger ones. all panss scores were also correlated with the
number of hospitalizations (panss r ¼ 0.25, p ¼ 0.005;
panssp r ¼ 0.28, p ¼ 0.001; panssn r ¼ 0.23, p ¼ 0.008).
antipsychotics’ dosage was associated with the severity of
symptomatology (total panss scores) (r ¼ 0.43, p ¼ 0.0001),
mostly of positive symptoms (panssp scores) (r ¼ 0.52,
p ¼ 0.00001), but also of negative (panss negative scale—
panssn) (r ¼ 0.28, p ¼ 0.001) and general ones (panssg
scores) (r ¼ 0.38, p ¼ 0.0001).
akathisia was significantly associated with higher antipsychotic dosages (t ¼ 2.41, df ¼ 129, p ¼ 0.0039) and extrapyramidal symptoms at the sas also showed a similar trend
(r ¼ 0.21, p ¼ 0.048). finally, akathisia at the bars was
positively correlated with tardive dyskinesia symptoms
(abnormal involuntary movements) at the aims (r ¼ 0.22,
p ¼ 0.011).
subjects, grouped according to their genotypes for  xxxg655xxx  and
 xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms, were not different for demographic and
basic clinical features, such as age, sex, diagnosis, and drug
used (data not shown).
 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms and symptomatology
for the genetic analyses, we included drug dose as covariant
given its significant weight as stratification factor. genetic
variants did not differentiate patients regarding symptomatology (table ii), except  xxxg655xxx , which showed a trend toward a
positive effect on delusions (ancova, including dose as
covariant: f ¼ 3.23, df ¼ 2, 120, p ¼ 0.043), and  xxxg656xxx  141c
ins/del, which showed an effect on the negative symptom of
stereotypy (ancova, including dose as covariant: f ¼
11.28, df ¼ 1, 124, p ¼ 0.0011). delusional severity was
increased in patients homozygous for the  xxxg655xxx  48g containing allele, while stereotyped thinking was more severe
among subjects carrying the del allele of the  xxxg656xxx  141c
ins/del polymorphism.

 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms and side effects
of antipsychotic treatment
the  xxxg656xxx  311 ser/cys genotype showed a non-significant
trend to be associated with the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia
(w2 ¼ 3.70, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.05; or ¼ 0.10–95%, ci ¼ 0.02–0.75); in
fact, two of the only three heterozygous carriers of the cys
allele had a positive diagnosis of full tardive dyskinesia. this
could be considered a false positive given that is due to only
three subjects; however all these three 311 ser/cys subjects
showed an overall higher rate of side effects. these results were
not influenced by the introduction in the model of the
metabolizing status defined according to the number of the
functional cyp2d6 alleles [kores plesnicar et al., 2006].
results were also independent of the drug used (typical versus
atypical); in the case of the 3  xxxg656xxx  311 cys carrying subjects,
one was treated with  xxxd3568xxx  and two with risperidon.
finally, the  xxxg655xxx  also showed a marginal effect on
dyskinesia, but only on abnormal involuntary movement of
the trunk (ancova including dose as covariant: f ¼ 3.67,
df ¼ 2, 119, p ¼ 0.028).
discussion
the present paper investigated  xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  gene
variants with a comprehensive assessment of symptomatology
and treatment side effects in a sample of clinically stable
schizophrenic outpatients. our results suggest mainly a
negative association with a possible marginal finding between
 xxxg656xxx  311 ser/cys genotype and tardive dyskinesia, though
this finding is due to only three subjects.
in our sample we observed a cross correlation between
symptomatology, drug dose, and extrapyramidal side effects.
this is not surprising as more severe patient symptomatology
may force the clinician to increase the dose of the antipsychotic
and to cause more severe side effects accordingly. this
phenomenon is not new in the literature [seeman, 1981; kane
and smith, 1982; pierre, 2005] and in the context of our study
this finding was reported with the aim of reducing the bias
when investigating gene associations with symptomatology
and extrapyramidal side effects.
we found no association with  xxxg655xxx  a-48g polymorphism
and either symptomatology of schizophrenia or extrapyramidal side effects of the treatment, except for the marginal
association with higher scores for delusions (panss) and the
abnormal involuntary trunk movement (aims). the  xxxg655xxx 
48gg genotype has been recently associated with worse
results on prefrontal cortex performance test [rybakowski
et al., 2005]. the same polymorphism was not associated with
symptomatology of schizophrenia in japanese patients
[kojima et al., 1999] and the association was quite weak in
our sample. the number of the studies is however too low to
consider an overall disadvantageous effect of this genotype on
specific symptomatology or extrapyramidal side effects conclusive.
regarding the  xxxg656xxx  ins-141cdel genotype, we only
observed higher scores for stereotyped thinking and no
association with extrapyramidal side effects. it is well
established that stereotyped patterns of behavior are related
to disturbed striatal dopaminergic function [cooper and
dourish, 1990] and our result is in line with the finding of a
correlation between the degree of striatal  xxxg656xxx  binding
asymmetry in schizophrenia subjects and the neuropsychological measures of stereotypy [pedro et al., 1994]. the findings
about the associations of this polymorphism either with the
symptomatology or the extrapyramidal side effects have not
been conclusive even within different studies on japanese
schizophrenics, although they were all performed in hospitalized patients. while an increase in the severity of positive

 xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  polymorphisms and long-term antipsychotic treatment

symptoms was associated with the number of the del alleles in
one study [himei et al., 2002], in another study of similar size
no associations were observed between the ins/del genotype
and either positive symptoms of schizophrenia or the response
to antipsychotic medication [ohara et al., 1998]. similarly,
there is the discrepancy on the occurrence of extrapyramidal
side effects between different japanese studies [hori et al.,
2001; mihara et al., 2001, 2002; nakazono et al., 2005]. only
two studies addressed the occurrence of extrapyramidal side
effects in caucasian patients. no associations between tardive
dyskinesia and the ins/del genotype were observed in longterm hospitalized isreali schizophrenics [segman et al., 2003].
similarly no association was found between the ins/del
genotype and early or late extrapyramidal side effects in
german schizophrenics [kaiser et al., 2002]. it can be
concluded that the  xxxg656xxx  ins-141cdel polymorphism is not
predictive for extrapyramidal side effects, at least not in
patients of caucasian origin, while the studies in japanese
patients are inconclusive and need further validation.
the other putative functional  xxxg656xxx  polymorphism,
ser311cys, was not associated with clinical symptomatology
in our study. these findings however need validation in a
larger sample because of the very low frequency of ser/cys
genotype in our sample (0.024). this observed frequency was
even lower than the frequency of 0.043 reported for german
schizophrenic patients in which unfortunately only the extrapyramidal side effects were studied [kaiser et al., 2002]. in a
larger group of italian schizophrenic patients, in which the
frequency of ser/cys genotype was 0.10, a strong correlation
was observed with disorganized and delusional symptomatology [serretti et al., 2000a]. observations of the significant
association between the presence of  xxxg656xxx  311cys allele and
symptomatology, however in the opposite direction, came from
asian schizophrenic patients in which the frequency of ser/cys
genotype was higher than in our sample. the presence of
311cys allele was associated with significantly lower positive
and negative symptoms in japanese schizophrenics [himei
et al., 2002], while han chinese patients with this genotype
scored lower on all panss subscales [lane et al., 2004].
however, it has been already observed that oriental populations may reverse association observed in caucasians [serretti
et al., 2005]. although the duration of the treatment may
influence residual symptomatology, the interindividual variance is generally believed to be substantially stable over time
[maziade et al., 1996]. in fact the duration of the treatment did
not seem to influence the association of ser/cys genotype with
the symptomatology in both asian samples, as the japanese
patients were long-term hospitalized patients [himei et al.,
2002], and the han chinese were newly hospitalized patients
with acute exacerbation [lane et al., 2004]. the absence of
association between  xxxg656xxx  ser311cys polymorphism and
symptomatology of schizophrenia in our study could be more
related to the small sample size and the low cys allele
frequency than to the fact that our patients were on long-term
maintenance treatment. alternatively we may hypothesize an
influence of the severity of the disease, as all our schizophrenics
were outpatients in stable remission.
in contrast to several other studies which found no
association of  xxxg656xxx  311 ser/cys genotype and tardive
dyskinesia [kaiser et al., 2002; chong et al., 2003; segman
et al., 2003] or with early side effects [kaiser et al., 2002], we
observed a marginal association between this genotype and the
tardive dyskinesia despite the fact that this finding is due to
three patients only.
though symptomatology is believed to be due to frontal
cortex dopamine disregulation and involuntary movements to
limbic disregulations [lewis, 2002], we could hypothesize that
 xxxg656xxx  ser/cys subjects have an overall dopamine imbalance
that could result both in the presently observed association

813

with more severe aims scores and in the previously reported
association between  xxxg656xxx  ser/cys variant and delusion and
disorganization [serretti et al., 2000a]. however, the low
frequency of ser/cys genotype and the small sample size could
not allow us to replicate the association with symptomatology.
the low frequency of the  xxxg656xxx  ser/cys variant did not allow us
to perform linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses due
to insufficient informativeness; moreover other interesting
polymorphisms (such as taqi a) were not typed in the present
sample thus exposing to the risk of a false negative finding.
the strength of the present paper is its possibility to control
for mutual interactions of clinical and genetic factors. also, our
findings were not biased by the genetic heterogeneity as all the
patients were recruited in a geographic area with ethnically
homogeneous population [tiilikainen et al., 1997; vidan-jeras
et al., 1998].
the main limitation of the present paper is its cross-sectional
nature that did not allow us to investigate the direction of
possible cross correlations. we observed that higher doses were
associated with more severe symptomatology, most probably
due to an attempt to control for more severe baseline
symptoms. we could not investigate lifetime symptomatology;
however more severe present symptomatology was associated
with the number of previous hospitalisations. also the
association between drug doses and side effects has been
previously reported and tardive dyskinesia symptomatology
has been strongly associated with lifetime cumulative dose of
antipsychotics. unfortunately, this information was not available in our sample and this is a strong limitation of our study.
in conclusion, our study evidenced that  xxxg655xxx  and  xxxg656xxx 
variants are not influencing liability to tardive dyskinesia
independently from the other clinical variables we included in
the model.
