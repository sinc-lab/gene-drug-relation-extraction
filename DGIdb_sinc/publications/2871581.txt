abstract. 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma),
3,4-methylenedioxy-amphetamine (mda), and their optical
isomers, were assayed for their affinities at radiolabeled
brain serotonin (5-ht1, 5-ht2) and dopamine (d2) binding
sites. ( r ( - ) - m d a and r ( - ) - m d m a displayed moderate
affinities for 3h- xxxd2419xxx -labeled 5-ht2 sites ( k i = 3425
and 3310 nm, respectively) whereas the affinities for their
s(+)-enantiomers were lower (ki = 13,000 and 15,800 nm,
respectively). similar absolute and relative affinities were
obtained at 3h-serotonin-labeled 5-ht1 sites; binding at
d2 sites was very low (ki>25,000 nm in each case). the
( - ) > ( + ) order of potency at 5-ht2 sites is consistent with
the observation that r ( - ) - m d a is a more potent psychoactive agent than its s(+)-enantiomer, but contrasts
with the reported finding that s ( + ) - m d m a is more potent
than r ( - ) - m d m a in humans. these results suggest that
m d m a , unlike m d a and other hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines, does not work primarily through a direct
interaction at 5-ht sites.

3,4methylenedioxyamphetamine - 5-ht receptors - dopamine
receptors

3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) has attracted the attention of psychopharmacologists because of
its psychoactive actions and putative therapeutic utility
(anderson et al. 1978). although this agent is structurally
related to 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda) and certain other hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines, its particular psychoactive properties (including minimal, if any, hallucinogenic effects) indicate that m d m a may possess a
mechanism of action distinct from that of these other
agents. we have recently reported that a significant correlation exists between the human hallucinogenic potencies, as
well as discrimination derived edso values, of a series of
substituted phenylisopropylamines and their brain 5-ht2
receptor affinities (glennon et al. 1984). in the present
study, we wished to determine and compare the affinities
of m d m a and m d a for brain 5-ht1, 5-ht2 and dopamine (d2) binding sites in order to gain information on
their mechanism of action.

materials and methods

3h- xxxd2419xxx  (90.4 ci/mmol), ah-serotonin (27.3 ci/
mmol) and 3h-n-methylspiperone (76.7 ci/mmol) were obtained from new england nuclear. 3h-n-methyl-spiperone
is a new radioligand for dz dopamine receptors (titeler
et al. 1985). serotonin hc1 and  xxxd2850xxx  were obtained
from sigma. sulpiride and cinnanserin were gifts from dr.
m. kuhar. m d m a and its isomers were synthesized as
their hc1 salts and were available from an earlier study;
m d a and its isomers were obtained as their hc1 salts from
nida.
the membrane preparation and radioligand binding assays were performed as described previously (glennon et al.
1984). male zivik-miller sprague dawley rats (200 g) were
decapitated and the brains were removed and placed in
ice-cold 0.9% saline. dissecting over ice, the striata and
frontal-parietal cortices were removed and again placed in
saline. the pooled tissues were weighed and quick frozen
over dry ice before being stored at - 2 5 ° c. the time between dissection and freezing was not longer than 30 min
and tissue was stored for no longer than 1 week. tissue
was homogenized in 30 vol 50 m m tris-hc1, 10 m m
mgc12, and 0.5 m m na2edta (ph 7.7 at 25 ° c). following homogenization the homogenate was centrifuged at
35 000 g for 15 min. the pellets were resuspended and incubated at 37 ° c for 15 min followed by recentrifugation. the
final incubation medium (2.0 ml) included 0.4 nm 3h- xxxd2419xxx , 1.0 nm 3h-serotonin, or 0.1 nm 3h-n-methyl-spiperone for 5-ht2, 5-ht1, or d2 dopamine receptor assays,
respectively. wet (4 mg and 8 mg wet weight) cortical tissue
was used for the 5-ht 2 and 5-ht1 assays respectively and
2.5 mg of striatal tissue was used for the  xxxg656xxx  assays.
cinnanserin 10-6 m was used as the excess displacing agent
for the 5-ht2 assays and 10 -6 m serotonin was the excess
displacing agent for the 5-ht~ assays.  xxxg2020xxx  140 m m was
present in the  xxxg656xxx  assays as the excess displacing
agent, as sulpiride (10-5 m) is a sodium-dependent ligand.
 xxxd2850xxx  (10 -5 m) was present in all assays. each compound was assayed in triplicate three times at 11 different
concentrations. after incubation for 15 min at 37°c the
incubation media was filtered over gf/b filters, washed
with 10 ml ice-cold buffer, and placed in scintillation vials
with 5 ml scintillation fluid (scintiverse, fisher). after
equilibration the vials were counted on a beckman 3801
at an efficiency of 50%. competition experiments were ana-

results

table i lists the ki values for m d m a and related compounds at the 5-ht1, 5-ht2, and d2 receptors. racemic
m d m a was found to possess a nearly equal affinity for
5-t-it1 and 5-ht2 sites (ki = 6850 and 8300 nm, respectively) and a rather low affinity for dz sites (ki = 41250 nm).
binding was stereoselective at 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 sites in
that r ( - ) - m d m a possesses about a 3-fold greater affinity
than does its s(+)-enantiomer. similar absolute and relative affinities were obtained with (+)-, r ( - ) - , and s(+)mda.
diseussiorl

the affinity of ( + ) - m d a for 5-ht~ sites is in the same
range as that of other hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines of comparable human potency. in addition, as with
other hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines, the r ( - ) isomer is several-fold more potent than its s(+)-enantiomer
with respect to its human potency (shulgin 1978) and
5-ht2-site affinity (table 1). racemic mdma, and its
isomers, display a binding profile similar to that of mda.
however, it has been claimed that in human subjects
(_%)-mdma produces an effect that is reminiscent of, but
somewhat different from, that of m d a and, furthermore,
(although only limited data are available) that s(+)m d m a is several-fold more potent than r ( - ) - m d m a
(anderson et al. 1978). if, indeed, s ( + ) - m d m a is more

potent than r ( - ) - m d m a , it is unlikely that this effect
can be attributed to a direct 5-ht2-mediated mechanism
because of the greater potency of r ( - ) - m d m a for 5-ht2
sites.
m d a produces both hallucinogen-like and amphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects in animals; it has
also been demonstrated that r ( - ) - m d a may be primarily
responsible for the former effect, whereas it is the s(+)isomer that produces the amphetamine-like effect (glennon
1985). these results are consistent with those observed in
human subjects; that is, there is a considerable stimulant
component associated with s ( + ) - m d ~ (shulgin 1978).
knowing that n-methylation decreases the potency of hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines, but has essentially no
effect on the potency of stimulant phenylisopropylamines
(such as amphetamine) (glennon 1985), it seems entirely
possible that m d m a is more amphetamine-like than
mda. this would also explain the greater potency of s(+)m d m a over r ( - ) - m d m a . thus, the hypothesis that we
are currently developing is that m d m a acts via a mechanism more closely related to the mechanism of action of
amphetamine than to that of the hallucinogenic phenylisopropylamines. however, m d m a does bind to 5-ht binding sites and (in addition to any indirect or releasing properties that it might possess) may also be capable of producing
effects that are serotonin related.
