summary the kidney is not only a primary  xxxd2019xxx  target organ but also is a key site of  xxxd2019xxx 
metabolism. recent studies have shown that  xxxd2019xxx  has important physiologic effects on proliferation
and differentiation in a variety of benign and malignant cells. our preliminary immunohistochemical study
showed that  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr) was highly expressed in renal distal tubules and collecting ducts,
whereas the renal proximal tubules and glomeruli did not express vdr. these observations led us to study
the expression of vdr in various kidney tumors to determine the possible diagnostic utility of vdr.
paraffin tissue microarray (tma) blocks were constructed containing core cylinders from clear cell (52),
papillary (35), chromophobe (20), sarcomatoid (20), and metastatic (59) renal cell carcinomas (rccs).
oncocytomas (20), normal adult kidneys (12), and normal adult adrenals (6) were also included. in
addition, 30 clear cell rccs and 3 collecting duct carcinomas were also studied using conventional
sections. furthermore, vdr messenger rna and protein expression was also quantified using real-time
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis.  xxxg2412xxx  was
strongly positive in collecting duct carcinomas (100% [3/3], cytoplasmic), papillary rccs (94% [33/35],
cytoplasmic), chromophobe rccs (85% [17/20], membranous), and oncocytomas (90% [18/20],
cytoplasmic with perinuclear accentuation). in contrast, vdr expression was focal/weak and present
only in the peripheral regions of clear cell rccs.  xxxg2412xxx  was weakly positive in sarcomatoid
variant rccs (88% [14/16]) regardless of the type of associated original rcc. overall, vdr is a
discriminative marker for renal cell tumors. the preferential expression of vdr in chromophobe rccs,
oncocytomas, and collecting duct carcinomas is in agreement with the concept that these tumors
differentiate toward epithelium lining the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts. considering the
different vdr expression patterns, vdr is a useful ancillary tool in distinguishing chromophobe rccs
from oncocytomas. in addition, the focal and much weaker vdr expression in clear cell rccs makes
vdr valuable in distinguishing clear cell rcc from other types of rccs.

the steroid hormone  xxxd408xxx  3
[1,25(oh)2d3] ( xxxd1682xxx ) triggers multiple signaling
pathways in its target cells [1].  xxxd1682xxx  has been shown

expression of  xxxg2412xxx  in kidney tumors
to regulate ca2+ uptake from the intestine [2], modulate the
growth of the joint growth plate [3], and regulate the
differentiation of keratinocytes [4]. the  xxxd1682xxx –vitamin
d receptor (vdr) system also inhibits clonal proliferation
of a variety of human malignancies [5,6] and promotes the
differentiation of these malignant neoplasms.  xxxd2019xxx 
receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a
 xxxd1682xxx –activated transcription factor that interacts with
coregulators and the transcriptional complex to alter the rate
of target gene transcription [7]. it has been shown that there
is a significant portion of vdr in the cytoplasm [8], which
exerts rapid bnongenomicq actions that take place outside
the nucleus. recently, several studies have also revealed the
presence of vdr in the cytoplasmic membrane [1]. the
kidney is not only a primary  xxxd2019xxx  target organ but is
also critically involved in  xxxd2019xxx  metabolism. although
the expression of vdr messenger rna (mrna) is
ubiquitous along the nephron segments [9], autoradiographic studies have failed to detect significant binding of vitamin
d3 in the proximal tubules [10], suggestive of the
differential distribution of vdr in the nephron segments.
these studies are in keeping with the findings that vitamin
d3 induces  xxxd2019xxx –dependent calcium reabsorption in
distal tubules [11]. renal cell carcinomas (rccs) are
clinicopathologically heterogenous diseases, and they are
the most common malignant tumors of the adult kidney.
renal cell carcinomas represent 2% of all malignant tumors
[12]. renal cell carcinomas are categorized as clear cell,
papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, and unclassified
types [13]. oncocytomas are one of the most important
benign kidney tumors. the diagnosis of primary kidney
tumors, especially in small biopsies, may be problematic,
requiring the discovery of additional new markers. in
addition, previous studies have shown the correlation of
the classification of primary kidney tumors with distinctive
cytogenetics of each entity and its prognostic impact
[12,14,15]. precise subtyping of primary kidney tumors is
important for predicting prognosis and designing appropriate treatment. the goal of this study was to investigate the
expression levels of vdr in normal kidney and various
types of primary kidney tumors to evaluate the possible use
of vdr as a diagnostic marker.

2. materials and methods
2.1. case selection and tissue microarray
a total of 177 cases of primary kidney tumors from
radical nephrectomy specimens and 59 metastatic rccs
were selected from the surgical pathology archives of the
university of chicago hospitals between 1992 and 2002. all
paraffin-embedded donor tissue blocks were sampled with
1.5-mm puncher using a beecher tissue microarray (tma)
instrument (beecher instruments inc, sun prairie, wi).

[n = 30] and type 2 [n = 5]) with fuhrman grade 1 (n = 2),
grade 2 (n = 23), grade 3 (n = 7), and grade 4 (n = 3);
20 chromophobe; 20 sarcomatoid components of rccs
(15 associated with clear cell rccs, 3 associated with
papillary rccs, and 2 associated with unclassified rccs);
20 oncocytomas; 59 metastatic rccs; and 12 normal
kidneys were subjected to routine hematoxylin and eosin
and immunohistochemical staining. in addition, 3 collecting
duct carcinomas were also used for immunohistochemical
analysis by using conventional tissue blocks. to better
understand the vdr expression in clear cell rccs, vdr
immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 30 clear
cell rccs (table 1) with fuhrman grade 1 (n = 5), grade 2
(n = 10), grade 3 (n = 8), and grade 4 (n = 7) using nonarray
sections. among these 30 clear cell rccs, 15 cases
contained a minority population of cells with sarcomatoid
and/or poor differentiation, 10 cases showed extension to
renal veins and/or metastasis to perinephric lymph nodes, 2
cases had subcutaneous metastasis, and 2 cases displayed
invasion to the adrenals. fifteen adrenal cortical carcinomas
were also used for this study.

chromophobe rccs expressed vdr (c and d) (original magnification 200) with a characteristic membranous staining pattern.

2.2. immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemical staining was performed on 4-lm
sections obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tma and conventional blocks. endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with 3%  xxxd2298xxx  for
5 minutes. a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-vdr3 antibody
(c-20, santa cruz, ca) at 1:1000 dilution was applied for
1 hour at room temperature. a subsequent reaction was
performed with a biotin-free horseradish peroxidase enzyme–labeled polymer of the envision plus detection
system (dako, carpinteria, ca). a positive reaction was
visualized with diaminobenzidine solution, followed by
counterstaining with hematoxylin. colonic adenocarcinomas were used as positive controls. appropriate negative
controls for the immunostaining were prepared by using
nonimmune rabbit igg.

2.3. evaluation of immunohistochemistry
immunoreactivity was evaluated in a semiquantitative
manner by analyzing both staining intensity and percentage

of positive cells. positive vdr staining was defined as
coarse, dense cytoplasmic and/or membranous staining. we
divided the staining intensity into 4 categories: negative (0),
weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3) reactivity. immunoreactivity was considered negative in cases with weak
staining of less than 5% of cells [16]. positivity was divided
into focal (5%-50% positive cells) or diffuse (n50% positive
cells). to reduce interobserver variation in the evaluation of
staining patterns, the above semiquantitative method was
used to independently score immunohistochemical staining
of the tumors by 3 pathologists (w. l., m. s. t., and t. k.),
and a consensus score was achieved.

2.4. rna isolation and real-time reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
total rnas were extracted from frozen specimens of 5
clear cell rccs and 3 normal human kidney tissue using
trizol reagents (invitrogen corp, carlsbad, ca). vitamin
d receptor mrna expression was assessed by real-time
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
[17]. briefly, first-strand complementary dnas were

cell rccs showed focal immunoreactivity of vdr in the periphery of the tumor (b) (original magnification 200).  xxxg2412xxx 
expression was higher in the areas with sarcomatoid (c) (original magnification 200), poor differentiation (d) (original magnification
200), and vascular invasion (e) (original magnification 200). subcutaneous metastatic clear rccs showed the diffuse vdr staining (f)
(original magnification 200). clear cell rccs with adrenal invasion expressed vdr (left) (g and inset), whereas adrenal tissue was
negative for vdr (right). neither adrenal cortical carcinomas (h) (original magnification 200) nor their vascular invasion component (h
inset) (original magnification 200) were positive for vdr.

synthesized from 5 lg of total tumor and normal kidney
rnas in a 50-ll reaction using moloney murine leukemia
virus–reverse transcriptase (invitrogen) and oligo(dt) 12-18
as the primer. the complementary dnas were then used as
the template (5 ll per reaction) for real-time rt-pcr
amplification. real-time rt-pcr was carried out using a
cepheid smart cycler (cepheid, sunnyvale, ca) and a
sybr green pcr reagent kit (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca). the pcr primers for human vdr are
5v-ccaggataagatccg gctgg-3v (forward) and 5vaaagtag cgagagg caccaa-3v(reverse).  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) was used as
the internal control for each reaction;  xxxg861xxx  primers are
5v-tgaccctggagact ttgacc-3v (forward) and 5vgttgaaggggcagg tga at a-3v (reverse). all
primers were tested for their specificity by conventional
pcr before being used for the real-time pcr quantitative
studies. the ct value was obtained from the real-time pcrs,
and the starting amount of each target mrna was calculated
based on a calibration curve and the ct value. the amount
of mrna was normalized to  xxxg861xxx  mrna and presented
as relative values.

for vdr detection. human kidney extract was used as a
positive control [18]. the separated proteins were transblotted onto an immobilon-p membrane (millipore, bedford, ma) at 45 ma overnight, with the use of a minigel
transfer apparatus (bio-rad, hercules, ca). the membranes
were stained with 0.05% india ink to confirm equal protein
loading and transfer. the membrane was then blocked with
tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% tween-20 and 5% dry
milk. subsequently, the membrane was incubated sequentially with c-20 (1:10 000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antirabbit igg (k&p laboratories,
gaithersburg, md) (1:10 000 dilution) dissolved in the same
solution for 1 hour each at room temperature. the vdr
protein recognized by c-20 was visualized using a
lumiglo chemiluminescent substrate kit (k&p laboratories). the same membrane was reprobed with antibody
against b-actin (sigma, st. louis, mo) for equal loading
control. immunoreactive bands were quantified by measuring the densities of the immunostained bands using the
quantity one program (bio-rad).

2.5. western blot analysis
frozen specimens of 11 clear cell and 3 papillary rccs
were obtained from surgical pathology archives of the
university of chicago hospitals between 1992 and 2002.
 xxxg2412xxx  levels in these samples were determined
by western blot analysis, as previously described [17]. the
specimens were placed into ice-cold sample buffer, boiled
for 5 minutes, and sonicated for 1 minute with a branson
microprobe (branson, danbury, ct). after sonication, the
samples were boiled for an additional 3 minutes and
centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. protein concentration was determined using the amido black method. the
conventional glycine-based sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system (12% gel) was used

fig. 4 relatively low expression of vdr mrna in 5 clear cell
rccs.  xxxg2412xxx  mrna expression was analyzed by
real-time rt-pcr, and the vdr mrna levels were compared
with the levels of normal human kidneys.

1274

2.6. statistical analysis
data were presented as the mean f sd and analyzed
with student t test to assess significance. p values of .05 or
lower were considered statistically significant.

3. results
3.1.  xxxg2412xxx  expression in
nonneoplastic kidneys and adrenals
 xxxg2412xxx  expression was strongly present in
distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of normal
adult kidneys (fig. 1a). immunoreactivity was found in
both the cytoplasm and cell membrane of the epithelium
lining the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts.
however, the positive staining of vdr was absent in
proximal renal tubules and glomeruli of normal kidneys. all
6 submitted adrenal glands did not display the expression
of vdr.

3.2.  xxxg2412xxx  expression in renal and
adrenal tumors
ninety-four percent of primary papillary rccs (94%
[33/35]) diffusely and strongly expressed vdr. in 28 type 1
papillary rccs, vdr staining was diffusely cytoplasmic
(fig. 1b) and displayed a pattern similar to the staining of
distal renal tubules. five type 2 papillary rccs demonstrated a predominantly membranous staining pattern (fig. 1c).

w. liu et al.
the intensity of vdr immunostaining did not correlate to
fuhrman nuclear grade in both types of papillary rccs.
there was no statistical significance of the average
immunostaining intensity between types 1 (2.50) and 2
(2.40) papillary rccs. the remaining 2 papillary rccs with
clear cell features did not express vdr (fig. 1d).
 xxxg2412xxx  was positive in most sarcomatoid
variant rccs (88% [14/16]) (fig. 1e), regardless of the
types of associated original rccs. the average immunostaining intensity was significantly lower in sarcomatoid
rccs (1.31) than in both type 1 and 2 papillary rccs (both
p b .01).
all 3 collecting duct carcinomas (100% [3/3]) strongly
expressed vdr (fig. 1f) (mean intensity, 3.00) in the
cytoplasm and cell membrane of the tumor cells.
of oncocytomas, 90% (18/20) were positive for vdr
(fig. 2a and b) (mean intensity, 2.51) showing a
cytoplasmic staining pattern with a perinuclear accentuation
(fig. 2b inset). of chromophobe rccs, 85% (17/20) were
positive for vdr (fig. 2c and d) (mean intensity, 2.24),
demonstrating a characteristic membranous staining pattern.
in general, fuhrman nuclear grade of the tumor cells did not
correlate with the immunostaining intensity of vdr in
chromophobe rccs. there was no statistically significant
difference in the average vdr-immunostaining intensity
between oncocytomas and chromophobe rccs.
importantly, 45 (87%) of 52 tma clear cell rccs were
negative for vdr (fig. 3a). the remainder (13% [7/52]) of
clear cell rccs demonstrated only scattered vdr-positive
tumor cells (b5%). to verify these findings in tma clear

kidney tissue (lane 1), human papillary rccs (prcc) (lanes 2, 3, and 4), and human clear cell rccs (crcc) (lanes 5-15).  xxxd2019xxx 
receptor protein expression levels were significantly less in clear cell rccs than in papillary rccs (b) ( p b .01).

expression of  xxxg2412xxx  in kidney tumors
cell rccs, 30 clear cell rccs with variable characteristics
(table 1) were analyzed using conventional nonarray
sections. in contrast to tma study, clear cell rccs were
not entirely negative for vdr expression. focal/weak vdr
immunoreactivity was detected in the peripheral regions
(fig. 3b) in clear cell rccs, reflecting the heterogeneity of
vdr expression in this tumor type. in vdr positive areas,
the average immunostaining intensity of vdr was 1.17 in
clear cell rccs, which was significantly lower than that in
oncocytomas, papillary and chromophobe rccs, and
collecting duct carcinomas (all p b .01). similar to the
other types of rccs, there was no correlation between
fuhrman nuclear grade and vdr-immunostaining intensity
in clear rccs. however, the average of vdr immunostaining intensity was higher in the areas with sarcomatoid
(fig. 3c) (1.40) or poor differentiation (fig. 3d) (3.00).
increased vdr-staining intensity was also present in areas
with vascular invasion (fig. 3e) (2.50) and perinephric
lymph node metastasis (2.50). interestingly, although 2 clear
cell rccs with fuhrman grade 1 demonstrated focal vdr
immunoreactivity, their subcutaneous metastatic counterparts showed the diffuse vdr-staining pattern (fig. 3f).
two clear cell rccs with fuhrman nuclear grade 2 displayed adrenal invasion. the tumor cells demonstrated
diffuse vdr immunostain (fig. 3g, left and inset);
however, the adjacent adrenal tissue was not immunoreactive to vdr antibody (fig. 3g, right). in contrast, all 15
adrenal cortical carcinomas were completely negative for
vdr (fig. 3h and inset).

3.5.  xxxg2412xxx  expression in
metastatic rccs
most frequent metastatic sites of rccs in this study were
lung (31% [18/59]) and bone (25% [15/59]). among these

3.3.  xxxg2412xxx  mrna expression in clear
cell rccs
 xxxg2412xxx  mrna expression was also
analyzed by real-time rt-pcr in clear cell rccs. all 5
clear cell rccs expressed vdr mrna (fig. 4), but the
vdr expression levels were much lower than normal
kidney controls. there was an average of 21% of vdr
mrna expression, ranging from 7% to 50% (mean f sd,
21% f 8%), by clear cell rccs compared with normal
kidney controls.

3.4. western blotting analysis of vdr expression
in rccs
western blot analysis exhibited the presence of vdr
protein in the extracts of human papillary and clear rccs
(fig. 5a). the molecular weight was approximately 50 kd,
which was identical to the corresponding positive control
(normal human kidney tissue). in parallel with our
immunohistochemical study, papillary rccs had much
higher vdr expression levels when compared with those
of clear cell rccs. after normalization to b-actin,
densitometric measurements revealed that papillary rccs
(fig. 5b) (mean f sd, 1.28 f 0.15) expressed significantly
higher vdr protein levels than that of clear cell rccs
(mean f sd, 0.41 f 0.18) ( p b .01).

fig. 6  xxxg2412xxx  expression in metastatic rccs
(tmas). metastatic rccs were immunoreactive to vdr in
papillary (a) (original magnification 200), clear cell (b) (original
magnification 200), and sarcomatoid (c) (original magnification
200) rccs.

1276
metastatic rccs, 33 cases were positive for vdr (59%
[33/59]) (fig. 6). all 6 metastatic papillary rccs were
immunoreactive to vdr (fig. 6a), and their average
immunostaining intensity was 2.50. there was no statistically significant difference when their immunostaining
intensity was compared with the primary papillary rccs.
in contrast, 25 metastatic clear cell rccs were positive for
vdr (49% [25/51]) (fig. 6b). for metastatic clear cell
rccs, the average immunostaining intensity was 1.97,
which was significantly higher than that of primary clear
cell rccs (mean intensity, 1.17) ( p b .01). both metastatic
sarcomatoid rccs were immunoreactive to vdr with
average immunostaining intensity 1.50 (fig. 6c).

4. discussion
human renal cell tumors are thought to arise from the
precursor cells of different specialized epithelium located
along the length of the nephron [19-21]. clear cell rccs
and papillary rccs, the 2 most common rccs, arise from
the epithelium of the proximal tubule. on the contrary,
oncocytoma, chromophobe, collecting duct, and medullary
rccs are believed to arise from the distal nephron. multiple
monoclonal antibodies have been studied in the diagnosis of
kidney tumors [22-25]; however, most of these antibodies
have limited clinical diagnostic use because of requirement
of special tissue preparation or lack of specificity. more
recently, pn-15 [26] and  xxxg1417xxx  [27,28], specific for
proximal nephron or tumors with proximal nephron origin,
have also been tested in the diagnosis of kidney tumors. at
present, there is no reliable marker specific for distal
nephron or tumors derived from it.
we have shown that adult kidneys selectively expressed
vdr.  xxxg2412xxx  expression was strongly present
in distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of normal
adult kidneys. in contrast, vdr expression was not found in
proximal renal tubules and glomeruli. previous studies have
revealed that distribution of vdr in the nephron segments
is heterologous in rat [10], and  xxxd2019xxx –induced calcium
reabsorption mainly occurs in distal tubules [11,29]. our
findings are consistent with these studies.
we hypothesized that the differential expression of vdr
observed in renal tubules might also be present in the various
kidney tumors. most of our tma clear cell rccs did not
express vdr. this finding is contradictory to previous study
[18] claiming that clear cell rccs do express vdr. to
resolve the disagreement, we further analyzed vdr mrna
and protein expression in clear cell rccs using nonarray
blocks. in general, vdr mrna expression levels in clear
cell rccs were much lower than in normal kidney controls.
immunohistochemical analysis of nonarray sections revealed
that clear cell rccs were not entirely negative for vdr
expression but exhibited focal vdr immunoreactivity in the
peripheral regions. consistent with their focal vdr immunoreactivity, western blot analysis demonstrated that vdr

w. liu et al.
expression levels in clear cell rccs were much lower than in
papillary rccs. overall, similarly to proximal renal tubules,
vdr expression was focal and low in classic clear cell rccs,
which provides additional evidence for the concept that
classic clear cell rccs may arise from the precursor
epithelium of proximal tubules. although vdr expression
in clear cell rccs did not correlate with increased fuhrman
nuclear grade, its expression did increase in the sarcomatoid
or poorly differentiated areas in clear cell rccs. increased
vdr immunoreactivity was also observed in perinephric
lymph node metastases and intravascular tumor islands of
clear cell rccs. these findings have similar implications to
those published data in colorectal carcinomas [30], where the
up-regulation of vdr correlated with the tumor progression.
similarly, our data suggested that vdr expression might be
up-regulated in clear cell rccs as tumor dedifferentiates or
progresses (invasion and metastasis), probably as a counteractive measure in response to tumor cell growth. the
phenomena can be used to differentiate clear cell rccs with
adrenal invasion from primary adrenal cortical carcinomas
that were completely negative for vdr.
on the contrary, almost all the papillary rcc strongly
expressed vdr regardless of the types of papillary rccs,
which suggested that papillary rcc did not fully recapitulate the differentiation of proximal tubular epithelium.
instead, it may show some characteristics of the distal
nephron. interestingly, 2 of 35 papillary rccs were
completely negative for vdr. we further reviewed the
morphology of these 2 cases by using the original nonarray
slides. both cases showed typical papillary formation with
distended stomal core by collections of foamy histiocytes;
however, the tumor cells displayed uniform clear cell
differentiation. because these 2 cases demonstrated clear
cell features and the absence of vdr staining, this
observation may support our conclusion in primary clear
cell rccs that vdr-expression level was inversely
proportional to the degree of clear cell differentiation. on
the other hand, vdr can be used as a discriminative marker
for clear cell and papillary rccs because of their
differential vdr expression levels.
both chromophobe rcc and oncocytoma are thought to
differentiate toward intercalated cells [31,32]. although
chromophobe rcc is a malignant tumor and oncocytoma is
a benign one, they both have some morphological and
genetic overlaps [12,15]. it is imperative to distinguish these
2 entities because of marked differences in prognosis and
treatment. the overlapping features sometimes cause the
differential diagnostic difficulty. our study demonstrates
that both chromophobe rcc and oncocytoma strongly
expressed vdr; however, they had different vdr staining
patterns. oncocytoma exhibited cytoplasmic staining of
vdr with a perinuclear accentuation (fig. 2b). in contrast,
most chromophobe rccs showed characteristic membranous staining, which corresponds to their well-defined thick
cell membranes (fig. 2d). furthermore, vdr immunoreactivity is also useful in distinguishing chromophobe from

expression of  xxxg2412xxx  in kidney tumors
clear cell rccs in view of the virtually much weaker vdr
expression by clear cell rccs.
sarcomatoid rcc has been found to arise in all types of
rccs [33]. because there is no evidence that it arises de novo
as sarcomatoid rcc [20], it is not considered as a separate
entity [33]. it is rather viewed as a manifestation of highgrade carcinoma of the type of rcc from which it arises [33].
although most sarcomatoid rccs were positive for vdr,
the intensity of the staining was weaker than non–clear cell
vdr-positive rccs. on the other hand, there was no
difference of vdr staining intensity among the sarcomatoid
rccs arising in the different subtypes of rccs. our results
suggest that decreased vdr staining in intensity may reflect
the loss of the differentiation of their original rccs as they
progressed to a high-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma.
collecting duct carcinoma is believed to originate in the
distal nephron. unlike chromophobe rcc and oncocytoma,
which recapitulate differentiation of intercalated cells of the
cortical collecting duct [33], collecting duct carcinoma is
thought to differentiate toward the epithelium lining
medullary collecting ducts. all collecting duct carcinomas
strongly and diffusely expressed vdr in a staining pattern
that was indistinguishable from that of the collecting duct
epithelium of adult kidney.
in conclusion, most chromophobe, papillary, and oncocytic renal tumors exhibited extensive vdr immunoreactivity. in contrast, vdr expression in clear cell rccs was
limited to focal and peripheral regions of the tumor.
interestingly, vdr expression was up-regulated in metastatic, angioinvasive, and poorly differentiated foci of clear
cell rccs. the relationship between vdr expression and
the metastatic potential of clear cell rccs requires further
study. the variable levels of vdr expression, together with
the different vdr immunoreactive patterns, can be used as
ancillary tools to distinguish various subtypes of kidney
tumors from each other and to differentiate metastatic clear
cell rcc from adrenal cortical carcinoma.
