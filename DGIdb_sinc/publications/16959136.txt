i abstract i
this study was designed to validate an enzyme-linked
immunosorbentassay (elisa)and liquid chromatography-tandem
massspectrometry (lc-ms-ms) method for the detection of nine
benzodiazepines in hair. sixteen hair case samples were tested
from drug-related deaths where a positive benzodiazepine blood
result was obtained. the case samples were decontaminated with
0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx , distilled water, and dichloromethane.
for elisa analysis, the samples were extracted by incubation in
monobasicphosphate buffer for i h and then neutralized with
dibasic phosphatebuffer. they were diluted 1:5 with phosphate
buffer saline (pbs) prior to analysis. for lc-ms-ms, the samples
were incubated overnight in methanol/25% ammonium hydroxide
(20:1). the benzodiazepineswere extracted by solid phase.
thirteen sampleswere confirmed positive by lc-ms-ms. the
benzodiazepines detected included diazepam, nordiazepam,
temazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and iorazepam. using a cutoff concentration of 0.1 ng/mg oxazepam, the immunalysis|
benzodiazepinemicroplate elisa demonstrated a sensitivity and
specificity of 100% and 81%, respectively, compared with
lc-ms-ms results.

introduction
benzodiazepinesare the most frequent]y prescribed drugs in
the world as they are cheap, effective,and safe. in addition to
this, they are addictive and, thus, widely abused (1). they tend
to appear more often in overdose cases than any other type of
drug. one study showed that 45% of drug-related deaths tested
positive for diazepam, and 33% of these cases tested positive for
temazepam (2). the scottish health statistics show that diazepam is currently the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepine in scotland (3).
benzodiazepines include a large number of drugs, which are
used as sedatives, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants. they exert an additive effect when taken simultaneouslywith alcohol and other drugs, including opiates, sedatives,
antidepressants, and neuroleptics (4).
despite benzodiazepine abuse being the most significant in

the world, it is the detection of other drugs in hair, such as
heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, and cannabis, that have been
welt researched and documented, genzodiazepine detection
has, however, been reported in hair collected from living and
deceased users using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(gc-ms) (5-10) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (lc-ms-ms) (11-13). another study identified
five benzodiazepines using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)and a restriction access extraction column

(14).
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)is a fast, automated, and sensitive technique that can be used to screen
large numbers of unknown samples. immunoassay systems
used for hair testing must display cross-reactivity with the
parent drug and metabolites that are found in hair, must not be
affected by interference from the extracted hair matrix, and
must be capable of detecting drug concentrations found in
hair (typicallyin the pg/mg range). there appear to be a limited
number of publications that have studied elisascreening for
benzodiazepines in hair. in one study, two postmortem hair
samples tested positive for benzodiazepinesby elisa,and these
were confirmed as positive for flunitrazepam and its metabolite
using gc-negative ion chemical ionization-ms at a cut-off of
0.1 ng/mg 7-aminoflunitrazepam (15). benzodiazepinesin hair
have been detected using fluorescence polarization immunoassay and radioimmunoassay (16,17).
the aim of this study was to validate an elisa and
lc-ms-ms method for detecting benzodiazepines in hair. for
this purpose, the results from the diagnostic testing of 16 postmortem case hair samples using both methods were compared.

experimental
samples
the 16 hair samples tested were postmortem case samples
submitted to our laboratory. one scalp hair sample was collected in each case. the samples selected for testing were from
cases in which the blood result was positivefor benzodiazepines
using a validated in-house lc-ms-ms method. thirteen negative hair samples were obtained from volunteers and post-

procedure prior to spiking to produce the calibrators for the
elisa and lc-ms-ms procedures.

apparatus
microplate elisa. a miniprep 75 automatic pipettor, purchased from tecan (san jose, ca),was used to dilute samples
and to pipette all calibrators, controls, and samples into the microplate wells. the plates were washed using a columbus plus
washer system from tecan (gr6dlg, austria) and read using a
sunrise remote eia autoreader from tecan. disposableborosilicate glass culture tubes (75 • 12 ram, vwr international,
poole, u.k.) were used for the samples and dilutes.
lc-ms-ms. this consisted of a surveyor hplc system with
an lcq deca xp plus ion trap ms. hplc was performed on a
gemini c18 column (150 mm• 2.0 ram, 5-1jm particle size),
fitted with a guard column with identical packing material (4
mm x 2.0 ram, phenomenex, torrance, ca).

elisamethod
an aqueous extraction method previously used for elisa
screening for cocaine and amphetamine in hair was used
(18,19). monobasic phosphate buffer (0.5 ml) was added to
each sample. the samples were incubated in an oven for 1 h at
60~ after cooling, 50 pl of dibasic phosphate buffer was
added to each sample to neutralize the acidic medium. the
samples were vortex mixed, then diluted 1:5 on-line with pbs.
the diluted extracts were also vortex mixed.
each elisarun contained a set of calibrators consisting of a
blank and spiked hair samples at a concentration of 0.1, 0.2, and
0.5 ng/mg oxazepam. a positive control (0.3 ng/mg oxazepam)
and a negative control were used to check kit performance.
these were distributed to wells at the beginning and end of the
plate. the calibrators and controls were prepared by spiking approximately 10 mg of drug-free decontaminated hair with oxazepam at the desired concentration, then extracting the spiked
samples in the same way as the case samples.
fifty microliters of diluted hair extract was added to the microplate weils in duplicate and left to infiltrate the antibodies for
i h. after this time passed, 100 tjl of benzodiazepine enzyme
conjugate reagent was added to each well. the plate was then
left in the dark at room temperature for an incubation period
of 1 h.
following incubation, the microplate wellswere washed with
deionized water (6 x 350 ijl) in order to remove any unbound
sample or residual conjugate reagent that may be left in the
wells. tmb substrate reagent (100 ijl) was added to the wells,
and the plate was left to incubate in the clark at room temperature for an additional 30 rain. after 30 rain, the reaction was
stopped by adding 100 ijl of stop reagent to each well. the contents of the wells turned yellow following addition of the stop
reagent, and this was to enable the chromophore to be detected at 450 nm. a reference wavelength of 620 nm was used
for background correction.

chemicals and reagents
methanol, acetonitrile, ammonium hydroxide, cyclohexane,
ethyl acetate,  xxxd2154xxx , dichloromethane, and  xxxd2400xxx 
were purchased from  xxxg257xxx  (poole, u.k.) and were of analytical
grade. ammonium formate and sodium  xxxd3215xxx  were
purchased from sigma-aldrich (dorset, u.k.). 7-aminoflunitrazepam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, diazepam, nordiazepam, nitrazepam,
7-aminoflunitrazepam-d 7, flunitrazepam-d7, oxazepam-ds, lorazepam-d4, temazepam-d5, diazepam-ds, and nordiazepam-ds
were obtained from promochem (teddington, u.k.). solidphase mixed-mode cation exchange-hydrophobic phase extraction columns (zsdau020, 200 rag) were purchased from
united chemical technologies (bristol, pa). benzodiazepine
direct elisakits were purchased from immunalysis (pomona,
ca). the kits contained a 96-well antibody-coated microplate,
benzodiazepine conjugate labelled with horseradish peroxidase, substrate solution containing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (tmb),and stop solution containing 1n hydrochloric acid.
monobasic phosphate buffer [0.025m, ph 2.7 with 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa)],dibasic phosphate buffer (0.sm, ph 9.0
with 0.1% bsa),and phosphate buffer saline (pbs) (0.1m, ph
7.0 with 0.1% bsa) were also purchased from immunalysis.

dose-response curve. a dose-response curve was generated
for approximately 10 mg of drug-free decontaminated hair
spiked at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5

methods
washing of hair samples
the root-0.5 cm section was removed from each sample
where roots were present. the 0.5 cm-tip section was weighed
out into a vial for analysis and cut into 2-3-ram segments
using a pair of clean scissors. each sample was then split into
two separate vials for the elisa and lc-ms-ms extraction
procedures.
the samples were washed with 1 ml of 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate with a 10-rain sonication, 2 x 1 ml deionized water with
a 10-min sonication, and 2 x 1 ml dichloromethane with a 10rain sonication. the washings were not analyzed because the
likelihood of benzodiazepine contamination from an external
source was very low. blank hair was also washed using this

where ao is the mean absorbance value, and c is the standard
deviation of the absorbance values (20,21).
the intraday precision of the b/b0 (%) values was calculated
by spiking 10 drug-free decontaminated hair samples at 0.10
ng/mg oxazepam. these were tested on the same day and on
the same plate. this process was carried out on five separate
days, and an interday precision of the b/b0 (%) values was
calculated.
sensitivity and specificity. the sensitivity and specificity of
the assay were calculated by applying equations 2 and 3, respectively, which require the total number of true positives
(tp), true negatives (tn), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn) to be counted.

cross-reactivity. the microplate elisa is directed towards
oxazepam and cross-reacts 100% with it. to calculate cross-reactivity, pbs was spiked  xxxd1891xxx -200 ng/ml oxazepam to establish
a calibration graph. the cross-reactivity of other benzodiazepines was calculated relative to the calibration graph constructed from oxazepam-spiked calibrators. benzodiazepine
standards were also prepared in pbs, and the cross-reactivity at
100 ng/ml oxazepam was calculated (table i).

the cross-reactivity of the assay with some unrelated drugs
was also tested at a concentration of 10,000 ng/ml.
lc-ms-ms method
an alkaline pre-extraction was used prior to benzodiazepine
extraction by solid phase (22). ammoniated methanol was
found to produce slightly higher recoveries than just methanol
for diazepam, oxazepam, and flunitrazepam in another study
(14). methanol/25% ammonium hydroxide solution (1.5 ml,
20:1) was added to each calibrator and sample, left to sonicate
for 1 h, and stored at room temperature overnight. the solvent
was removed from the vials and transferred to a test tube. the
hair was washed twice more with 0.75 ml solvent, and the
washings were removed and transferred to the corresponding
test tube. the contents of the test tubes were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and reconstituted in 1 ml of phosphate
buffer (0.1m, ph 6.0).
solid-phase extraction (spe) method
world wide monitoring clean screen| columns (zsdau020)
were conditioned sequentially with 3 ml methanol, 3 ml distilled water, and 1 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1m, ph 6.0). the
vortex mixed samples were loaded onto the columns and allowed
to drip through without the presence of a vacuum. the columns
were washed sequentially with 2 ml distilled water, 2 ml 20%
acetonitrile in phosphate buffer (0.1m, ph 6.0), 2 ml cyclohexane, and 2 ml distilled water. the columns were dried for 5
min under full vacuum after the second part of wash step, for t
min after the third part of the wash step, and for 5 min after the
final part of the wash step. the analytes were eluted using
1.5 ml 2% ammoniated ethyl acetate (followed by a 2-min
drying step on full vacuum) and 1.5 ml dichloromethane/
isopropanol/ammonium hydroxide (78:20:2). the samples
were reconstituted with 100 i~l of the mobile phase initial
conditions.

lc-ms-ms conditions
the column was maintained at 25~ the mobile phase
consisted of 3mm ammonium formate/0.001%  xxxd2154xxx 
in water (a) and acetonitrile (b) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.
the initial gradient conditions were 65% a, decreased to
20% a after 13 rain. the mobile phase composition was 10%
a from 13.5 to 16.5 min. initial conditions were restored from
16.5 to 20 rain, and the system was allowed time to equilibrate. the total run time was 20 min. a divert valve taking
lc flow to waste was used for the last 7 min of the run to preserve the ms source.
all mass spectral data were collected in electrospray positive
ion mode. the capillary temperature, sheath and auxiliary gas
flow rates, and collision energies were optimized for each analyre. the probe voltage used was 4.5 kv. internal standard data
was collected in selected ion monitoring mode, and analytes
were identified on the basis of their retention time and full
ms-ms spectra. the analyte product ion ratios were monitored to gain further qualitative identification data. the optimum tuning parameters as well as precursor and product
quantitation ions are shown in table ii.

in this study, evaporation of the eluant in the spe method
was investigated as a potential means of lowering analyte recovery. four spiked samples were prepared in eluant and blown
down with nitrogen at 40~ and the results were compared
with three spiked samples that were not prepared in eluant or
heated during blowing down with nitrogen.
intraday precision. five extracted standards were prepared at
10 ng/30 mg and 50 ng/30 rag. standards were also prepared at
2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ng/30 mg to produce linearity data. a
blank was prepared containing no internal standard as well as
a blank containing only internal standard. the blown down extracts were reconstituted in 100 ljl of mobile phase, and 201jl
was injected. the mean product ion/peak-area ratio value was
substituted into the regression equation for a particular drug,

are shown in figure 2.

recovery
the total extraction recovery for each analyte is given in
table iv for 10 and 50 ng/30 mg and ranged from 53 to 98%.
generally, the analytes had total extraction recoveries > 70% at
both concentrations. 7-aminoflunitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide recoveries were lower than the other analytes.
the experiment conducted on the authentic hair case sample
to determine the efficiency of the alkaline extraction showed
that the greatest concentration of diazepam and nordiazepam
were detected followinga 16 h incubation (4.26 and 1.67 ng/mg,
respectively).the concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam
detected after a 1, 2, and 4 h incubation were similar and were
within a small range (2.40-2.70 ng/mg and 0.90-1.16 ng/mg,
respectively).

stability
alkaline pre-extraction. the recovery for all analytes
following the overnight alkaline extraction ranged from
87 to 102% (tablev). these results show that this milder alkaline extraction using methanol/25% ammonium hydroxide
(20:1) is suitable for benzodiazepines. the lower 7-aminofluni-

 xxxd1866xxx  and chlordiazepoxide recoveries were not a result of
alkaline hydrolysis. lorazepam was hydrolyzed to a greater extent than temazepam or oxazepam, which have a similar chemical structure to lorazepam. it is possible that the presence of an
electron withdrawing chlorine atom on both aromatic rings in
the lorazepam structure increases the lability of the ring c=n
to attack by the base used in the extraction, promoting hydrolysis. temazepam and oxazepam only have an electron withdrawing chlorine atom and are, therefore, less susceptible to
hydrolysis.
evaporation. with the exception of 7-aminoflunitrazepam
and chlordiazepoxide, the analyte recoveries were all > 98%. 7aminoflunitrazepam recovery was 72%, and chlordiazepoxide
recoverywas 89%, which could partly explain the lower total extraction recovery values found for these analytes. the recovery
values for the evaporation step are given in table vi.
intra- and interdayprecision. the intra- and interday precision  xxxd1891xxx  ng/30 mg and 50 ng/30 mg were acceptable (all <
20%). the % rsd values were generally lower at the higher
concentration. these values are shown in tablesvi and vii. the
% rsd values were relatively high for some analytes at both the
low and high spike concentrations. it may be the case that precision is slightly lower because of the "soft" ionization mode
used in the ms-ms system.
lod andloq. the lod and loq for all the benzodiazepines
tested ranged from 0.03 to 0.62 ng/30 mg and 0.05 to 1.02
ng/30 rag. the values are shown in table viii.

case sample results

discussion

the validated elisaand lc-ms-ms methods for the detection of benzodiazepines in hair have been successfully applied
to 13 postmortem positive case samples. table ix shows the
elisaand lc-ms-ms results for benzodiazepines in the 13 tp
samples. overall, the elisaand lc-ms-ms results correlated
well. thirteen of the 16 hair case samples were screened and
confirmed as tp using a cut-off value of 0.1 ng/mg oxazepam.
this cut-off value was used as it produced no fn results. cutoff values of 0.2 and 0.5 ng/mg oxazepam produced one fn
and two fn results, respectively.using a 0.1 ng/mg cut-off, the
sensitivity and specificity of the immunalysis benzodiazepine
microplate elisa were 100% and 81%, respectively, versus
lc-ms-ms.
benzodiazepines detected by lc--ms-msin the samples included diazepam (10 samples), nordiazepam (10 samples), oxazepam (3 samples), temazepam (10 samples), lorazepam (1
sample), and nitrazepam (1 sample). the diazepam levels detected in 3 of the 10 samples were below the loq; therefore,
only 7 samples were reported as positive. using lc-ms-ms,
benzodiazepine hair concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 2.86
ng/mg diazepam, 0.27 to 1.79 ng/mg nordiazepam, 0.35 to 0.89
ng/mg oxazepam, and 0.22 to 0.73 ng/mg temazepam. one
sample tested positive for lorazepam at 0.38 ng/mg, and another
sample tested positive for nitrazepam at 0.24 ng/mg.
table iv. recovery in spiked hair

a comparison of the hair and blood results, shown in table x,
found that diazepam was detected in 10 tp hair case samples
where a diazepam-positive result was found in blood. one
sample contained a diazepam levelin hair < lod. nordiazepam
was not detected in one sample in which the blood result was
positive. interestingly, temazepam was detected in four samples
in which the blood result was negative. there was, however,one
case where the hair tested negative for temazepam and the
blood results were positive. the level of temazepam in blood was
very low in this case (0.02 mg/l). this levelcould be for a naive

user, but there is no information in the police report to support
this. oxazepam was detected in one sample for which the blood
result was positive. interestingly, oxazepam was detected in
two samples for which the blood result was negative. in contrast, five hair case samples tested negative for oxazepam where
the blood result was positive. the blood results were very low in
three of these cases (samples 3, 5, and 13). lorazepam and nitrazepam were detected in one hair sample for which the blood
result was negative.
in general, benzodiazepine levels were in the ranges reported
in the literature. with the exception of sample 8, nordiazepam
was always detected at a higher concentration than diazepam.

this finding is consistent with other studies (5,9).
oxazepam was only detected in three samples. a possible
reason for this low detection rate may be that oxazepam has a
relatively short half life compared with nordiazepam, for example, and is a polar compound, which may not readily incorporate into hair (14).
temazepam levels have not been widely reported in hair. in
this study, temazepam levels were present within a relatively
short range of 0.22-0.36 ng/mg, with the exception of sample 8,
which had a higher temazepam level of 0.73 ng/mg. a possible
reason for the lower temazepam levels found in our study is that
temazepam could be present as a metabolite of diazepam, rather
than the parent compound. lorazepam levels
in hair have also not been widely documented.

azepines in hair. thirteen samples screened as tp using the
elisaversus the lc-ms-ms method. the immunalysis benzodiazepine microplate elisa showed 100% sensitivity and
81% specificity using a cut-off value of 0.1 ng/mg oxazepam.
the lc-ms-ms method used provided the sensitivity necessary for quantitation of benzodiazepines in postmortem hair
samples. it appears that mild alkaline extraction conditions are
suitable for benzodiazepines and does not result in any significant hydrolysis. an incubation time of 16 h in the alkaline
medium produced the greatest diazepam and nordiazepam recoveries compared with the shorter incubation times for one
authentic hair case sample. the evaporation step in the spe
method resulted in a relatively high loss of 7-aminoflunitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which is partly responsible for
the lower total extraction recoveries for these analytes.
the comparison of the hair and blood results has shown that
some benzodiazepines were detected in hair but not in blood
and vice versa. hair analysis for benzodiazepines should be
used to complement blood analysis.
