the clearance of hyaluronan (ha) and chondroitin sulfates
from the circulating blood and lymph in the body is mediated
by the membrane-bound ha receptor for endocytosis
(hare). previously, we found that two hare species of
~175 kda and ~300 kda are abundant in the sinusoidal
endothelial cells in rat liver, spleen, and lymph nodes
(zhou et al. [2000], j. biol. chem., 275, 37733±37741). in
the present study, immunocytochemical analysis of human
tissues showed a similar pattern with abundant expression of
hare in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver,
spleen, and lymph nodes. the two human hare proteins
were immunoaffinity-purified from human spleen. each protein was recognized in western blots using several anti-rat
hare monoclonal antibodies and was able to bind 125 i-ha
specifically. in nonreducing sds±page, these two human
hare species migrated at ~190 kda and ~315 kda; both
proteins are ~15 kda larger than the corresponding rat
hares, although the de-n-glycosylated core proteins are
essentially the same mass. after reduction, the human 190kda hare gave a single 196-kda species, which was not
seen in the ~315-kda hare after reduction. the reduced
~315-kda hare yielded two major proteins at ~250 kda
and ~220 kda. we determined the sequence of the human
190-kda hare cdna based on analysis of internal tryptic
peptides, as well as rt-pcr and 50 race analyses using
human spleen and lymph node cdna libraries. the human
gene that encodes hare is on chromosome 12.

ha is a high-molecular-weight linear polysaccharide
found in the extracellular matrix of all vertebrate tissues.
the polysaccharide is an alternating copolymer composed
of only two sugars: b(1,3)-linked-d-glucuronic acid and
b(1,4)-linked-n-acetyl- xxxd2211xxx . a wide range of
cellular activities utilize or require ha, including cell
proliferation, cell adhesion, recognition, morphogenesis,
differentiation, and inflammation (laurent and fraser,
1992; knudson and knudson, 1993; toole, 1997;
abatangelo and weigel, 2000). every day in tissues
throughout our bodies, we continuously synthesize and
degrade as much as 5 g of ha (laurent and fraser,
1991). because the total body content of ha in a typical
70-kg adult is ~15 g, we therefore turn over about onethird of our total body ha every day. laurent and
fraser (1992) and their co-workers showed that this
large burden of ha turnover in mammals is mediated
primarily by the liver and lymph nodes. this group and
ours demonstrated that the sinusoidal liver endothelial
cells (lecs) have a very active, recycling, endocytic
receptor that removes ha and a variety of chondroitin
sulfates from the circulation (fraser et al., 1983, 1985;
laurent et al., 1986; raja et al., 1988; mcgary et al.,
1989). presumably, the removal of this circulating ha is
necessary for normal health. because the rate of ha
turnover is so high, failure to remove it would likely
lead to extremely elevated concentrations of ha in the
blood within days. the physiological consequences of
increased blood viscosity due to accumulation of ha
are not known, but elevated serum ha levels are found
in a variety of disease conditions such as liver cirrhosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, and some
cancers (lai et al., 1998; manicourt et al., 1999; freitas
et al., 1996; thylen et al., 1999).
in previous studies using unique anti-rat monoclonal
antibodies (mabs), we purified this endocytic recycling
ha receptor (zhou et al., 1999), which has since (zhou
et al., 2000) been designated the ha receptor for endocytosis (hare), from rat liver lecs. we also demonstrated that hare is localized to the lecs, as expected,
but is even more abundantly expressed in the sinusoidal
endothelial cells of the spleen and lymph nodes. we
recently reported the first characterization of a functional
cdna for the rat 175-kda hare, confirming that this
smaller hare is an independent receptor able to function in the absence of the larger hare species (zhou
et al., 2002). here we describe the first purification of the
human hare proteins using cross-reactive anti-rat
hare mabs and identify the sequence of the human
190-kda hare protein.

subunit characterization of the two human hare
iso-receptors
the affinity purified 190-kda hare and ~315-kda
hare proteins were subjected to two-dimensional
340

fig. 1. immunoaffinity purification of the human hare proteins. human
hares were purified from nonidet p-40 extracts of human spleen tissue by
affinity chromatography using the anti-rat 175-kda hare mab-30. the
hare proteins were eluted at low ph, concentrated, subjected to sds±
page, and transferred to nitrocellulose. the membrane was stained with
0.05% copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid, tetrasodium salt (lane 1)
and then destained with distilled water. the destained nitrocellulose
membrane was treated with tbst to block nonspecific binding sites and
assessed for 125 i-ha-binding activity (lane 2). after the ligand blot assay,
the nitrocellulose membrane was subjected to western blot analysis using a
mixture of mabs raised against the rat 175-kda hare protein (lane 3). the
open and closed arrows indicate the positions of the human hare proteins
at ~190 kda and ~315 kda, respectively. these two human hare species
correspond to the previously characterized rat 175-kda and 300-kda
hare proteins (zhou et al., 1999).

sds±page analysis to determine their subunit compositions (figure 2). after reduction, the 190-kda hare
yielded a single major protein that migrated at ~196 kda,
indicating that the smaller hare contains only one polypeptide. two smaller minor bands are likely degradation
products of the larger protein. as with the rat 175-kda
hare (zhou et al., 1999), the reduced protein is unfolded
and thus migrates more slowly in sds±page. this
behavior is typical for receptors with extracellular domains
containing disulfide bonds, such as the cys-rich hare proteins (zhou et al., 2002). the ~315-kda hare yielded two
major proteins of ~220 and ~250 kda after reduction, indicating that the larger hare contains at least two types of
disulfide-bonded subunits. we have consistently observed
these two subunits in multiple independent preparations of
purified human spleen hare. the apparent molar ratio of
the 250 kda:220 kda subunits is about 2±3:1. in contrast,
the rat 300-kda hare contains three subunits in apparent
molar ratios of 1:1:1, respectively (zhou et al., 1999).
localization of hare in human tissues
using mab 30, which works well in immunocytochemical
applications, we found abundant hare protein expression
in human liver, spleen, and lymph node (figure 3). staining
intensity and therefore protein expression levels were much
greater in lymph node than in spleen or liver. in each tissue,
only cells in the sinusoidal regions were stained. in spleen,
the germinal centers and white pulp areas of splenic nodules
were unstained, whereas the venous sinusoids of the red pulp
stained strongly (figure 3a). controls using mouse serum
showed very low background staining in spleen (figure 3b)
or the other tissues (not shown).

identification and purification of human hare
we used a specific mab against the rat 175-kda hare to
purify the two rat liver hare proteins (zhou et al., 1999)
that had been identified in earlier studies employing a
photoaffinity derivative of ha (yannariello-brown et al.,
1992) and a novel ligand blot assay (yannariello-brown
et al., 1996, 1997). zhou et al. (2002) showed that the 175kda hare is functional as an endocytic receptor for ha in
the absence of the 300-kda hare; therefore, these two
hare species are iso-receptors for ha. the rat 175-kda
and ~300-kda hare proteins are each able to bind 125 iha in a ligand blot assay following nonreducing sodium
 xxxd3215xxx ±polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds±
page) and electrotransfer. furthermore, they are immunologically related, because all mabs raised against the
175-kda hare also recognize the 300-kda hare (zhou
et al., 2000). the 175-kda rat hare contains only one
protein, whereas the rat 300-kda hare contains three
distinct disulfide-bonded subunits of about 260 kda, 230
kda, and 97 kda (zhou et al., 1999). the 260-kda and
230-kda subunits of the 300-kda hare are both recognized by the panel of anti-175-kda hare mabs.
when we tested the ability of our mabs raised against the
rat 175 kda hare to recognize a human hare homolog,
we found that three of the eight mabs (numbers 30, 154,
and 159) showed specific reactivity in western blots and
immunocytochemistry. in particular, the level of expression
of putative hare proteins in human spleen was great
enough to detect specific 125 i-ha binding activity and
western reactivity in crude extracts (data not shown).
the specific reactivity of the human hare proteins
with mab 30, which had been used to purify the rat liver
hare, enabled us to purify hare directly from detergent extracts of human spleen by immunoaffinity chomatography (figure 1). elution of proteins bound to mab 30,
using a low ph buffer, yielded the same two species identified in crude extracts as candidate hares. a 50-fold
excess of nonlabeled ha inhibited 125 i-ha binding to
either of the two human hares by 490% (not shown).
the two human hare species at ~190 kda and ~315 kda
are larger by about ~15 kda than the corresponding rat
hare species. ha-binding activity and reactivity with
anti-rat hare mabs comigrated with these two major
proteins at ~190 kda and ~315 kda. the anti-rat 175kda hare mabs that cross-react with the 190-kda
human hare also recognize the ~315-kda hare.
based on densitometric analysis of protein detected in
western blots and ligand blots of the affinity purified proteins, the ~315-kda hare is consistently more abundant
that the 190-kda hare in human spleen. the apparent
molar ratio of the ~315-kda hare:190-kda hare in
spleen is ~2±3:1. interestingly, an almost reverse ratio is
observed for the two hare iso-receptors in rat liver
(zhou et al., 1999).

identification of the human 190-kda hare

analysis of nh2-terminal and internal peptide sequences
and determination of the 190-kda hare sequence
the affinity-purified hare proteins were reduced and separated by sds±page; the band corresponding to the reduced
190-kda hare was excised and subjected to internal peptide analysis following trypsin digestion. when the protein
databases were searched using the amino acid sequences
derived from the purified protein, an identical match was
found for a subset of seven peptides (table i) predicted to be
within a hypothetical human protein of unknown function
under accession number bab15793. seven additional tryptic
peptides derived from the 190-kda hare were matched by
mass spectroscopic analysis (within 50.2 da) to the same
deduced sequence in the database (table ii). this sequence
had also been independently identified (zhou et al., 2002)
as the most likely human homolog of hare based on an
overall homology of ~85% (78% identity) between the 1431amino-acid rat 175-kda hare and a putative 1193-aminoacid protein encoded by bab15793. the purified protein
was also subjected to automated amino acid sequence
analysis, and the nh2-terminal sequence was identified as
xllpnllmrl. this latter sequence is 67% identical to the
nh2-terminus of the rat 175-kda hare and was not identified in the putative open reading frame (orf) encoded by
bab15793, as will be discussed.
the identical match of 14 tryptic peptides that contain a
total of 120 amino acids (~10% of the protein), including a
23-residue peptide (table i), should be enough to conclude
that the partial sequence encoded by bab15793 is part of
the human hare. to support this conclusion further,
however, we utilized reverse transcriptase polymerase

fig. 3. immunocytochemical localization of hare in human liver, spleen,
and lymph node. sections of human spleen (a and b), lymph node (c), and
liver (d) were treated with anti-hare mab-30 (a, c, and d) or mouse
serum (b) and then stained as described in materials and methods. a
relatively low magnification is shown (the bar represents ~500 mm) to
emphasize the localization of the human hare protein in the sinusoidal
regions of each tissue.

chain reaction (rt-pcr) with human spleen or lymph node
mrna and a combination of human hare-specific and
bab15793-specific primers (babs) to identify, clone, and
sequence pcr products that span portions of a ~4-kb
region of the hare-coding sequence (table iii). the
eight pcr products shown in table iii each encoded two
to four tryptic peptides predicted to be in the bab15793
protein and confirm the relationship between the purified
human spleen hare and the partial protein sequence
deduced from bab15793.
the nucleic acid sequence and deduced protein sequence
for the 190 kda hare are deposited under genbank
accession number ay227444. the bab15793 nucleotide
sequence contains a partial orf of 1193 amino acids that
starts at nucleotide position 606. our rt-pcr products
generated from spleen mrna confirmed almost all of the
4575-bp bab15793 sequence with several important exceptions. most significant, key results characterizing new
human hare sequences were obtained from the most 50
rt-pcr product generated from primer pair bab1f

hare proteins. the two human hare proteins were immunoaffinitypurified from human spleen using anti-rat 175 hare mab-30, subjected
to nonreducing sds±page, and the gels were stained with coomassie
blue (lane 1) to visualize the hare proteins. the 190-kda hare and
~315-kda hare protein bands were excised, minced, and divided into
two portions for analysis by sds±page, with or without reduction
using b- xxxd26xxx , followed by silver staining. the 190-kda
hare protein gives a single ~196-kda species either with (lane 4) or
without (lane 2) reduction. the excised 315-kda hare is a single band
without reduction (lane 3) but gives two major species after reduction

error. the 140 amino acid sequence derived from the 1f±2r

the human hare proteins from spleen were immunoaffinity purified,
subjected to sds±page, and the 190-kda protein band was excised and
analyzed for internal peptide sequence following trypsin digestion. the
amino acid sequences of these 10 tryptic peptides were highly homologous
or identical to the sequences of the rat 175-kda hare, reported by zhou
et al. (2002), and seven of these (not in bold) were identical to regions
within a human hypothetical protein of unknown expression and
unknown function under genbank accession number bab15793. hare
peptides in bold were not in the orf for bab15793. in several cases, a
major (first) and minor (second) peptide sequence was determined from
the same high-performance liquid chromatography peak.

the molecular masses of seven peptides derived from tryptic digestion of the purified human 190-kda hare protein were determined by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry at the louisiana state university protein chemistry facility and corresponded with perfect identity to
deduced sequences within a predicted human protein of unknown function (accession number bab15793). the monoisotopic peptide masses were searched
against entries in the database, using peptidesearch software from the embl protein and peptide group. identical masses are assigned in this search if the
difference between the observed and predicted (calculated) masses for a peptide is 50.2 da. the corresponding starting and ending residues for each
peptide within the deduced protein sequence are shown. the n-terminal r or k residues in parentheses indicate the deduced residue in the protein and
confirm that trypsin digestion occurred on the c-terminal side of those amino acids as expected.

residues. this cdna was further extended by 50 rapid amplification of cdna ends to a position equivalent to the nh2
terminus of the rat 175-kda hare. we also obtained an
additional upstream in-frame sequence encoding 227 residues. only a few minor nucleotide differences were found
between the spleen and lymph node cdnas for hare.
based on all of these results, we conclude that we have identified and assembled a partial human cdna sequence for the
full-length hare, within which is encoded the 190-kda
hare. the numbering convention for the 190 kda hare
protein starts with the nh2-terminal ser1 residue found in
both spleen and lymph node cdna pools (which were pooled
from multiple individuals). nh2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed a leu residue at position 1 in the
purified protein from one individual. when a nucleotide
sequence error in bab15793 (omission of an a, at position
695, which resulted in a frame shift) was corrected, the
upstream orf was continuous with our cdna; this correction deleted eight amino acids at the n-terminal end of the
orf derived from bab15793. a second error in the bab15793 nucleotide sequence at t1452 (rather than c) is silent.
the human core protein is smaller, at 1416 amino acids,
than the corresponding rat protein (1431 amino acids),
although the native human protein is larger as assessed by
sds±page (figure 4, lanes 1 and 3). the possibility that
carbohydrate modifications are responsible for the apparent size difference between the rat and human hare proteins was confirmed by treatment of both proteins with
endoglycosidase-f to remove n-linked oligosaccharides
(figure 4, lanes 2 and 4). the deglycosylated rat and
human core proteins were virtually identical in size. because
the native human 190-kda hare is larger than the rat
protein by ~15 kda, the human protein presumably has
either more or larger n-linked oligosaccharides.

bab primers were derived from the bab15973 sequence. hsp primers were derived from the peptide sequences obtained from purified human spleen
hare, using the degenerate nucleotides found in the corresponding regions of the bab15973 sequence. the number of peptide sequences shown in tables i
and ii that were confirmed within each pcr product is indicated.

fig. 4. deglycosylation of hare. one microgram of purified rat (lanes 1
and 2) and human (lanes 3 and 4) hare proteins were denatured by
boiling in 0.5% sds, mixed with 0.5% np-40 and de-n-glycosylated using
~5 units n-glycosidase f at 37 c overnight. after sds±page and
electrotransfer to nitrocellulose, the hare protein bands were detected
using a mixture of anti-hare mabs.

hare (zhou et al., 2002). the human protein is predicted
to be a type i membrane protein (figure 5), with a large
nh2-terminal extracellular domain (~1324 amino acids), a
single transmembrane domain (~21 amino acids), and a
small cooh-terminal cytoplasmic domain (~72 amino

acids). the predicted mass of the 1416-residue core protein
is 154,090 da and the pi is ph 5.9.
the protein contains 17 potential n-glycosylation sites
(-n-x-t/s-) in the extracellular domain. twelve of these
sites are identical with sites in the rat 175-kda hare
(figure 6). an additional three nonclassical glycosylation
sequons (-n-x-c-) are present in the human hare, two
of which are conserved with the rat hare. an interesting feature of such cys-containing sites is that glycosylation and participation of the cys in a disulfide bond may
be mutually exclusive (miletich and broze, 1990). the 190kda hare extracellular domain has a delta serrate ligand
domain, and four b-ig-h3/fasciclin-like domains,three
metallothionein domains, four furin-like domains, a link
domain, and ~24  xxxg681xxx  (egf)-like
domains (many of which overlap) arranged in two cysteinerich clusters separated by a 353-amino-acid region that is
cysteine-poor, as well as one 93-amino-acid link (or xlink)
domain near the membrane junction (gly1063 ±tyr1155 ).
many of the programs, such as pfam-hmm, scanprosite,
smart (schultz et al., 1998), or cd-search, identify
domains that are only partial or weak matches (e.g., early protein and delta serrate ligand domains) or overlap with other
domains. in particular, the egf-like domains (figure 5)
show this latter characteristic. although the overall

fig. 5. domain organization of the human 190-kda hare. the scheme depicts the organization of protein domains identified by the programs
pfam-hmm, cd-search, scanprosite, or smart (schultz et al., 1998). abbreviations used are tmd (transmembrane domain) and egf (epidermal
growth factor). potential n-linked oligosaccharides at -n-x-t/s- sites are indicated by the carets.

organization of all of these domains is very similar between
the human and rat hare proteins, the exact arrangement
and number of each type of domain is not identical.
the cytoplasmic domain of the human hare
(~y1345 ÿl1416 ) contains four tyr, seven ser, one his, and
five thr residues, although only residues s1362 , s1402 , t1388 ,
y1384 , and y1396 are predicted (by netphos 2.0) to be phosphorylated. pest motifs for rapid degradation or consensus sequences for o-glycosylation with glcnac are not
present. as expected, the cytoplasmic domain contains several putative candidate motifs for targeting the protein to
clathrin-coated pits. the sequence ysyfri1350 at the junction between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains
contains an interesting overlapping combination of two
fxxb motifs, where f is either tyrosine or phenylalanine,

the human 190-kda hare and the rat 175-kda hare
protein sequences are 77% identical, with a gap frequency
of only 0.2% (using the sim alignment program), over a
region containing 1416 residues (figure 6). an additional
6.5% of the amino acid differences between the two proteins
are conservative substitutions (e.g., r/k or s/t). almost all
of the cysteine residues within the extracellular domains
of the two hare proteins are absolutely conserved,
which suggests that the two proteins have the same overall
folding and organization of their polypeptide chains. the
other hare family members (zhou et al., 2002) also share
this extensive conservation of cysteine residues in their
extracellular domains, as well as the same overall domain

human hare has no cysteine residues in its transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains. the cytoplasmic domains
of the rat and human hare proteins are less conserved
(25% identical) than their transmembrane (76% identical) or
extracellular domains (80% identical). nonetheless, two
candidate fxxb motifs for targeting these receptors to
coated pits are highly conserved: the human hare motifs
ysyfri1350 and fqhf1360 differ by only one amino acid
from the corresponding regions in the rat hare cytoplasmic domain (figure 6).

discussion
fig. 7. model for the organization of the two human spleen hare
iso-receptors. the 190-kda and ~315-kda hare iso-receptors isolated
from spleen are depicted as separate species in approximate molar ratios of
1:2, respectively. the 190-kda hare contains only one protein. the large
hare complex is composed of two (or perhaps three) disulfide-bonded
subunits of about 250 kda and one subunit of 220 kda. the molar ratios of
the two hare iso-receptors may be different in different tissues. all
hare proteins and subunits are membrane-bound and are predicted to
contain small cytoplasmic domains and very large ectodomains. the
hare proteins are elongated rather than globular (yannariello-brown
et al., 1997).

human proteins, derived from accession number
aaf82398, was designated fell because it contains fasciclin, egf-like, and link domains. the three sequences
represented by aaf82398, cab61358 and bab15793,
are 95% identical and may be the same sequence; the
slight differences could be due to sequencing errors or alternative splicing. the sequences of cab61827, which encodes
stabilin-1, and baa13377 are more related to each other
than to the three sequences noted or to hare. although
the baa13377 mrna sequence is present in endothelial
cells, the presence of protein or associated ha-binding
activity was not determined (tsifrina et al., 1999). hare
and the bab15793 sequence, which has recently been
extended by several other submissions to the database,
may be derived from a large protein originally designated
 xxxg2211xxx , deposited as a sequence of unconfirmed function
(politz et al., 2002). the  xxxg2211xxx  sequence was obtained
from a soluble protein, which was isolated from whole
liver extracts. because we have confirmed the first function for a member of this protein family, it may now be
more relevant to designate these proteins as hare or
hare-like rather than as fells or stabilins.
the overall similarities in their extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains suggest that the
members of this hare protein family may all be able
to bind ha,  xxxd1687xxx , or other glycosaminoglycans and mediate their endocytosis through the clathrincoated pit pathway. the differences in their membrane
and cytoplasmic domains also raise the possibility that
the members of this family could interact with different
membrane or cytoplasmic regulatory factors and, consequently, process or route these bound ligands through
different intracellular pathways.

the rat 175-kda hare protein is a functional endocytic
ha receptor when expressed from a nonnaturally occurring
synthetic cdna (zhou et al., 2002). the protein is not
directly encoded by an mrna but is derived from the
proteolytic processing of a larger protein, which may be
the large 260-kda subunit of the 300-kda hare complex
(zhou et al., 1999). the mrna encoding the rat 175-kda
hare is ~10 kb, substantially longer than that required for
this size protein. the strikingly similar characteristics of the
rat and human hares indicate that a similar proteolytic
processing generates the human 190-kda hare from one
of the large subunits of the 315-kda hare. the two
human hare iso-receptors described here have a very
similar organization to the two rat hares, and the three
anti-rat mabs that recognize the 190-kda human hare
also cross-react with the two large subunits of the human
~315-kda hare.
the organization of the two hare iso-receptors purified
from human spleen is depicted in figure 7. the 190-kda
and ~315-kda hares are most likely iso-receptors able to
function independently as coated pit mediated endocytic
receptors for ha. the 190-kda hare contains a single
protein. the ~315-kda hare is a disulfide-bonded complex that contains two to three copies of a 250-kda subunit
and one copy of a 220-kda subunit. spleen has about two
to three times more of the ~315-kda hare species compared with the 190-kda hare.
the link domain is clearly a good candidate for an habinding region, but it is very likely that other, perhaps
multiple, non-link ha-binding domains are also present
in the extracellular domain of hare. day, jackson, and
colleagues have extensively investigated the structural
requirements for ha-binding activity of link domains
from different proteins (bajorath et al., 1998; kahmann
et al., 2000; banerji et al., 1998; mahoney et al., 2001). in
general, the affinity constants of these link domains are
in the 106 m ÿ1 range, which is not suitable for efficient
receptor-mediated endocytosis. receptor±ligand complexes
targeted to coated pits typically have kd values in the 1±50
nm range. the longer ~315-kda hare iso-receptor
probably has more ha-binding domains than the smaller
190-kda hare.
the human hare sequence reported here shares a high
level of identity with the rat 175-kda hare and a family
of human proteins (zhou et al., 2002). one of these deduced

purification and sequence analysis of the hare from
human spleen
human spleen tissue was obtained from a 14-year-old
female patient undergoing splenectomy for hereditary
spherocytosis following approval from the university of
rochester research subjects review board. the tissue
was cut into small pieces on ice, added to 2% nonidet
p-40 in tbs containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors
(2 mm diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm n- xxxd2684xxx ), then homogenized using a tissumizer power homogenizer (tekmar,
cincinnati, oh) and incubated at 4 c for 1 h. the extract
was diluted fourfold with tbs and centrifuged at 12,000  g
for 30 min at 4 c. the supernatant was loaded onto a
column containing anti-rat hare mab-30 (zhou et al.,
1999, 2000) for affinity chromatography (~2 mg/ml igg
coupled to cnbr-activated sepharose). the same antibody
was used previously to purify the rat hare (zhou et al.,
1999). the column was washed with 10 volumes of tbst
and then eluted with 100 mm sodium citrate, ph 2.5. eluted
fractions were neutralized with 1 m tris, pooled, dialyzed
against tbs at 4 c, and concentrated using a centricon-30
device (amicon, part of millipore, bedford, ma).
the concentrated sample was subjected to sds±page
and in some cases then transferred to nitrocellulose.
the ha-binding activity of hare was determined by a
125
i-ha ligand-blot assay, and hare protein was localized
by western blot analysis as will be described. purified
human hare preparations were subjected to sds±
page, and gels were stained with coomassie blue to identify the proteins. the 190-kda human hare protein band
was excised and sent to the protein chemistry lab at the
university of texas medical branch at galveston for
trypsin digestion and amino acid sequence analysis of
internal peptides. samples of the tryptic digests were also

the human gene ( xxxg2211xxx ) encoding hare, which is in
the genome database (originally under accession number
nt_024383.2 and now nt_035234.1), is located on chromosome 12 and appears to be a highly interrupted gene.
the nucleotide sequence representing the orf for the portion that encodes the human 190-kda hare protein has
over 40 exons interrupted by introns that vary in length
from 143 to 70,255 nucleotides. the full-length hare gene
contains 69 exons that span 180.3 kb. all of the sequences
within this region were deposited as putative or known gene
products of unknown function. the present study provides
the first identification of a function for the protein encoded
by this gene. the human hare nucleotide sequence
reported here is 499% identical to the nucleotide sequence
of the exons identified in the nt_024383.2 gene. the mouse
hare gene (accession number ac025501.3) has a similar
organization, although the orientation and many of the
hare exons (assigned when the sequence was compiled)
appear to be incorrect throughout this region of the gene.
our current model for ha and  xxxd1687xxx  turnover in mammals highlights the role of hare in liver and
lymph nodes and to a lesser extent in spleen (weigel and
yik, 2002). hare mediates the uptake of ha into these
tissues so it can be removed from the lymph, or blood, and
degraded. a large fraction of the ~5 g of ha turned over
daily by humans is probably derived from skin, which contains about 50% of our total body ha (laurent and fraser,
1992) and which, remarkably, has a half-life of only ~1±1.5
day (tammi et al., 1991). presently, there are important
clinical uses for ha-containing devices in treating wounds,
osteoarthritis, and in eye surgery (abatangelo and weigel,
2000; panay and lower, 1999).
additional future uses of ha in clinical applications are
likely to be developed based on our growing understanding
of the biology of ha and its multiple roles in wound healing
(iocono et al., 1998; chen and abatangelo, 1999), angiogenesis (west et al., 1985; deed et al., 1997; rahmanian
et al., 1997), macrophage activation (horton et al., 1998,
2000), and metastasis (csoka et al., 1997; delpech et al.,
1997). a variety of different drug delivery systems utilizing
ha are also being developed (cantor et al., 1998; illum
et al., 1994; luo et al., 2000). given the likely increase in
the clinical uses of ha-containing devices and drugs, it is
now important that we understand the overall mechanism
of ha turnover in the body. in particular, the present
molecular identification and characterization of the human
receptor responsible for ha clearance is timely and should
facilitate further studies in this field.

identification of the human 190-kda hare

ligand blot assay
purified human spleen hare preparations were mixed
with equal volumes of a 2 sds sample buffer (laemmli,
1970) to give final concentrations of 16 mm tris±hcl, ph
6.8, 2% (w/v) sds, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01% bromophenol blue. no reducing agent was added unless as noted in
the figures. after sds±page, the contents of the gel were
electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 24
v at 4 c using 25 mm tris, ph 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20%
methanol, and 0.01% sds in a genie blotter apparatus
from idea scientific (minneapolis, mn). the nitrocellulose
membrane was treated with tbs containing 0.1% tween-20
at 4 c for 2 h or tbst overnight and then incubated with
2 mg/ml 125 i-ha in tbs without or with a 150-fold excess of
nonlabeled ha (as competitor) to assess total and nonspecific binding, respectively (yannariello-brown et al.,
1996, 1997). the nitrocellulose membrane was washed five
times for 5 min each with tbst and dried at room temperature. the bound 125 i-ha was detected by autoradiography with kodak (rochester, ny) biomax film.
nonspecific binding in this assay is typically 55%.
western blot analysis of human hare
nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  in tbs at 4 c overnight either after the
ligand blot assay or directly after sds±page and electrotransfer (burnette, 1981) as described. the membrane was
then incubated with anti-rat hare mabs (e.g., 1:5000
dilution of ascites) at room temperature for 2 h, washed

five times for 5 min each with tbst, and incubated with
goat anti-mouse igg conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
for 1 h at room temperature. the nitrocellulose was washed
five times for 5 min each with tbst and incubated with
the substrates p-nitro blue tetrazolium and sodium 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine for color
development (bio-rad), which was stopped by washing
the membrane with distilled water.
two-dimensional electrophoresis of human hare
immunoaffinity-purified human hare was first subjected
to sds±page without reduction and the gel was stained
with coomassie blue. the 190-kda and ~315 kda-hare
protein bands were excised from the gel, cut into small
pieces, divided into two portions, and then incubated in
sds sample buffer with or without 1.25% b- xxxd26xxx  at 90 c for 4 min; identical results were also obtained
with or without reduction using 10 mm dithiothreitol
followed by alkylation with 50 mm iodoacetamide. the
samples were then subjected to a second dimension of
sds±page in the absence of reducing agent and parallel
portions were processed in gel to identify the proteins by
silver staining (blum et al., 1987).
immunocytochemistry
human lymph node, liver, and spleen tissues were identified
by search of the computerized surgical pathology database
at the university of rochester following approval from the
institutional research subjects review board. the original
hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were reviewed, and
appropriate tissue blocks were selected for staining. the
tissues had been fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
at the time of surgery, processed, and paraffin embedded
overnight on a tissue tek v.i.p. processor. tissue sections
(5 mm) were collected on charged slides and dried at 60 c
overnight. the slides were dewaxed three times for 3 min
each with xylene, followed by four washes for 3 min each
with alcohol (100%, 95%, 90%, 70%), followed by a single
2-min wash in water at room temperature.
the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with
3%  xxxd2298xxx  for 6 min, followed by two 2-min
water washes. the slides were digested for 15 min at 37 c
in prewarmed 0.1 n hcl containing 0.32 mg/ml pepsin,
followed by a 2-min water wash and a 2-min phosphate
buffered saline (pbs) wash. the slides were washed with
pbs and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody
(1:500) at room temperature for 60 min. after a 1-min pbs
wash, the slides were treated with secondary antiserum (biotinylated horse anti-mouse, 1:200) for 30 min at room temperature. after another pbs rinse, the slides were incubated
with streptavidin±horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 from
jackson immunoresearch laboratories, west grove, pa)
for 30 min, washed once with pbs, and washed once
with distilled water. color development was for 5 min with
2.0% (v/v) aminoethylcarbazine and  xxxd2298xxx 
according to the manufacturer's instructions (scytek,
ut), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin.
slides were viewed with an olympus bx-40 light microscope equipped with an olympus dp10 digital camera for
photography.

from life technologies (part of invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
with random hexameric oligonucleotides or oligo(dt)20.
the pcr reactions using advantage 2 cdna polymerase
mix from clontech were carried out with incubation at
94 c for 2.5 min; 35 cycles of 50 c for 1 min, 68 c for 3
min, and 94 c for 1 min; and one cycle of 50 c for 1 min
and 68 c for 15 min. oligonucleotide primers were based
on either the human 190-kda hare peptide sequences
(hsp primers) or the nucleic acid sequence under genbank
accession number bab15793 (bab primers), which is
derived from accession number ak024503 (i.e., the
mrna for flj00112 protein). pcr products were

the dna bands were excised and purified using a gel
extraction kit. the purified pcr dna products were
cloned into pcr4-topo vector using the topo-ta cloning kit (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the colonies were
screened by pcr, and the dna insert size was verified by
restriction enzyme digestion using ecori. the plasmid
dnas from positive clones were purified using qiaprep
spin plasmid kits, and the complete inserts were sequenced
by the dna sequencing facility of the oklahoma medical
research foundation, oklahoma city, ok.
