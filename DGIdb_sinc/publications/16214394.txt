abstract
 xxxg783xxx  was originally isolated from human genomic dna by degenerate pcr. we isolated  xxxg783xxx  cdnas from various species, and
precisely analyzed its mrna expression in rat tissues, and found that  xxxg783xxx  was highly expressed in ␤ cells in the islets of rat pancreas.
when compared to the cell-surface receptors (i.e., choresistokinin receptor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, and sulfonylurea receptor) that
are known to predominantly express in the pancreatic ␤ cells,  xxxg783xxx  mrna was comparable to these receptors in mrna expression levels. in
addition, all of pancreatic ␤ cell lines, which we examined, expressed  xxxg783xxx  mrna at significant levels. its highest expression was detected
in a mouse ␤ cell line min6. to reveal the function of  xxxg783xxx , we searched for the ligands of  xxxg783xxx  by screening more than 1500 compounds.
as a result we found that cho cells expressing  xxxg783xxx  specifically responded to free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas), that is, elevation of intracellular
ca2+ was detected in these cells. among ffas tested, apparent stimulatory activities were detected in c12- to 16-length saturated ffas (e.g.,
 xxxd1921xxx ,  xxxd2681xxx , and  xxxd2833xxx ) and in both c18- and c22-length unsaturated ffas (e.g.,  xxxd2777xxx , elaidic acid, linoleic acid,
a- xxxd2490xxx , g- xxxd2490xxx ,  xxxd208xxx ,  xxxd2318xxx , and docosahexaenoic acid) at ec50 of micro molar range. we found
that ffas induced ca2+ influx and activated map kinase in cho cells expressing  xxxg783xxx . as it is known that the increase of intracellular ca2+
promotes insulin secretion, we expected the stimulation of ffas through  xxxg783xxx  would promote insulin secretion from pancreatic ␤ cells.
as we expected, ffas induced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) in min6 cells. our results indicate that  xxxg783xxx  is a cell-surface
receptor for ffas and regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic ␤ cells. ffas are known not only to provide an important energy source as
nutrients for the body but also to act as signaling molecules in various cellular processes including insulin secretion. however, the molecular
mechanism behind the relationship between insulin secretion and ffas is little understood. we believe that the discovery of a cell-surface
ffa receptor on pancreatic ␤ cells will provide a clue to resolve the relation between ffas and insulin secretion, and thus eventually lead to
the development of anti-diabetic drugs.

1. introduction
insulin is secreted from pancreatic ␤ cells in response to
elevated plasma glucose and various factors modify its secretion [1]. although free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas) are known as an
important energy source as nutrients, recent studies demonstrate that ffas additionally play a role in many important
biological functions, such as modulation of insulin secretion
[2,3]. ffas acutely enhance insulin secretion and support
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis). however, the

molecular mechanism behind these effects of ffas on pancreatic ␤ cells has remained unclear.

2. g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs)
gpcrs have common structure which span across the
cell membrane seven times and couple to g proteins to
transduce signals in cells. a variety of substances act as ligands for gpcrs. numerous gpcr genes have been found
in the human genome. however, the ligands of many of
these remain unknown, and such ligand-unknown gpcrs
are called as ‘orphan gpcrs’. gpcr genes in the human

genome are estimated to be around 700. half of these are
sensory receptors including receptors for smell. the other
half is regulatory receptors for cell functions. at present, the
number of orphan gpcrs is expected to be approximately
120.

3.  xxxg783xxx 
 xxxg783xxx  was first reported as one of the orphan gpcrs
clustered with gpr41, gpr42, and gpr43 on chromosome
19 [4]. these gpcrs have significant sequence homology
each other. at present, it is clarified by several groups, that
all of these gpcrs function as receptors for various lengths
of free  xxxd2154xxx  [5–8].
in analyzing for tissue distribution, we found that  xxxg783xxx 
mrna was predominantly expressed in the pancreas (fig. 1,
upper left). furthermore, by in situ hybridization, we confirmed that it was expressed in ␤ cells in the pancreatic islets
(fig. 1, below). supporting for these results, significant levels of  xxxg783xxx  mrna were detected only in pancreatic ␤ cell
lines (fig. 1, upper right).

4. search for  xxxg783xxx  ligand
we found that cho cells expressing human  xxxg783xxx 
specifically responded to ffas. using a fluorometric image
plate reader (flipr), we detected signal transduction as

intracellular calcium ion influx. we found that c10- to
c16-length saturated ffas and c18- to c22-length unsaturated ffas induced intracellular ca ion influx in cho cells
expressing  xxxg783xxx  in all species examined. their ec50 values
were micro molar levels (table 1).
ffa is also called as non-esterified fatty acid (nefa).
normal plasma levels in human are 0.2–1.7 mm, but most of
ffas are bound to  xxxg124xxx  [9]. ffas are well known
as nutrients for an important energy source in the peripheral
tissues. excess amounts of ffas are stored in the liver and

adipose tissues. in addition, ffas are known to modulate
insulin secretion from pancreas. however, this mechanism
remained unknown.

5. physiological function of  xxxg783xxx 
using the mouse pancreatic ␤ cell line, min6, we found
that at higher glucose concentrations, ffas induced insulin
secretion from the min6 cells. these results suggest that
ffas amplified glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from
pancreatic ␤ cells (fig. 2).
to determine whether insulin secretion by ffas is through
 xxxg783xxx , we used small interference rna (sirna) specific for
mouse  xxxg783xxx . ffa-induced insulin secretion was specifically suppressed by the sirna (fig. 3). our results indicate
that at least a part of insulin secretion from min6 cells by
ffas is through  xxxg783xxx  [7].

6. conclusion
our results indicate that  xxxg783xxx  is a cell-surface receptor
for ffas and regulates insulin secretion form pancreatic ␤
cells. we believe that potent and selective  xxxg783xxx  agonists
should represent a new class of drug for the improvement of
diabetes and consequently prevent in insulin-resistance and
