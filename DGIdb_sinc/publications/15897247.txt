abstract
acquired drug resistance represents a major challenge in
the therapeutic management of breast cancer patients. we
reported previously that the retinoid x receptor – selective
agonist  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ,  xxxd330xxx ) was efficacious
in treating animal models of tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer. the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of
 xxxd330xxx  on development of acquired drug resistance and
its role in overcoming acquired drug resistance in advanced
breast cancer. paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin were
chosen as model compounds to determine the effect of
 xxxd330xxx  on the development of acquired drug resistance. human breast cancer cells mda-mb-231 were
repeatedly treated in culture with a given therapeutic agent
with or without  xxxd330xxx  for 3 months. thereafter, cells
were isolated and characterized for their drug sensitivity.
compared with parental cells, cells treated with a single
therapeutic agent became resistant to the therapeutic
agent, whereas cells treated with the  xxxd330xxx  combination remained chemosensitive. cells with acquired drug
resistance, when treated with the combination, showed
increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic agent. furthermore,
cells treated with the combination regimen had reduced
invasiveness and angiogenic potential than their resistant
counterparts. these in vitro findings were further confirmed in an in vivo mda-mb-231 xenograft model. our
results suggest a role for  xxxd330xxx  in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents in prevention and overcoming
acquired drug resistance in advanced breast carcinoma.

women (1). the american cancer society estimates that
f215,990 women in the united states will be found to have
breast cancer and 40,110 women will die from the disease
in 2004. although chemotherapy provides the major
therapeutic modality for treatment of advanced breast
cancer, the 5-year survival for disseminated breast carcinoma is <20% due to relapse with drug-resistant disease.
several mechanisms of drug resistance have been characterized in breast cancer cell lines. the best understood
mechanism is p-glycoprotein (pgp) – mediated drug resistance (2). pgp has been shown to contribute to resistance to
natural product – based chemotherapeutic agents, including
taxanes, anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, podophyllotoxins,
and camptothecins (3). the relationship among pgp
expression, pgp function, and drug resistance in clinical
samples of breast carcinoma was best illustrated by
mechetner et al. (4). these investigators showed that the
level of pgp expression in freshly resected breast tumors
was strongly correlated with the degree of clinical
resistance to paclitaxel and doxorubicin. their findings
also revealed that both intrinsic and acquired expression
of pgp in breast cancer was likely to contribute in part to
therapeutic failure and relapse. other resistance mechanisms in breast cancer include alterations of glutathione
metabolism, altered topoisomerase, increased thymidylate
synthase levels, decreased reduced folate carrier, and
mutations in the  xxxg2313xxx  (5 – 9). thus,
developing effective treatment strategies to enhance
cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents while
reduce the risk of developing drug resistance is highly
desired.
 xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ,  xxxd330xxx ), a selective retinoid x
receptor ligand (10), has been shown to be an efficacious
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent in preclinical rodent models of breast cancer (11 – 14). furthermore, in
the rat n-nitroso-n-methylurea – induced mammary carcinoma model, tumors that were resistant to tamoxifen
responded to both  xxxd330xxx  and  xxxd330xxx /tamoxifen
combination (15). mechanistically, tumor regression by
 xxxd330xxx  in the rat n-nitroso-n-methylurea – induced
mammary tumors involved differentiation induction
along the adipocyte lineage leading to terminal cell
division followed by cell death (16). more recently, we
have shown that  xxxd330xxx  when combined with
paclitaxel produced a synergistic growth inhibition
(combination index < 1) in a rat n-nitroso-n-methylurea–
induced mammary tumor-derived cell line in vitro. in the
rat n-nitroso-n-methylurea – induced tumor model in vivo,
the  xxxd330xxx /paclitaxel combination regimen produced
a statistically significant decrease, when compared with
single agents alone, in total tumor burden and an

increase in overall objective response without further
intensifying the major side effects of paclitaxel (17). phase
i/ii clinical trials indicated that  xxxd330xxx  is safe and
well tolerated (18).
the encouraging results of  xxxd330xxx  alone or in
combination in preclinical models of early-stage mammary
carcinoma led us to examine the efficacy of  xxxd330xxx  in
more advanced preclinical models of breast cancer. to
evaluate the role of  xxxd330xxx  in treatment of breast cancer
further, we studied the efficacy of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic
combinations and determined the influence of  xxxd330xxx 
on the development and treatment of multidrug resistance
in advanced human breast cancer.  xxxd330xxx  represents a
good candidate for chemotherapy-based combinations due
to its nonoverlapping side effect profile with most
chemotherapeutic agents and its unique mechanism of
action. mda-mb-231 cells was chosen as a model cell line
because of its sensitivity to several cytotoxic agents used in
the treatment of breast cancer (19 – 21). in addition, mdamb-231 cells do not express the estrogen or progesterone
receptors, are  xxxg721xxx  positive, and have mutant p53
(22). thus, mda-mb-231 cells represent a model of
advanced breast cancer in which to examine the role of
 xxxd330xxx  in combination with cytotoxic agents for breast
cancer therapy. paclitaxel (a microtubule-stabilizing agent,
pgp substrate), doxorubicin (a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor,
pgp substrate). and cisplatin (an  xxxd3249xxx , non-pgp
substrate) were used to determine the effect of  xxxd330xxx 
on the development of acquired drug resistance.

materials and methods
chemicals and reagents
rpmi 1640, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and gentamicin were obtained from cambrex bioscience (walkersville,
md). paclitaxel in sterile solution was obtained from bristol
myers squibb (princeton, nj).  xxxd330xxx  was synthesized
at ligand pharmaceuticals, inc. (san diego, ca). paclitaxel,
vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate, and 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(mtt) were from sigma chemicals (st. louis, mo).
cell line
the human breast cancer cell line mda-mb-231 and
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) were
obtained from the american type culture collection
(manassas, va) and cambrex bioscience, respectively.
mda-mb-231 cells were routinely cultured in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/l
glutamine in 95% air-5% co2. huvecs were maintained in
egm-2 supplemented with  xxxg787xxx ,
heparin,  xxxg681xxx , hydrocortisone, vascular
endothelial growth factor,  xxxd228xxx , and 5% fetal
bovine serum.
in vitro drug sensitivity assay
to determine the drug effect after a single exposure,
mda-mb-231 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture
plates. stock solutions of each cytotoxic compound or
 xxxd330xxx  were dissolved in dmso, and the final

concentration of the solvent was <0.1%. mda-mb-231 cells
were exposed to the cytotoxic agent for 3 days and
 xxxd330xxx  for 6 days. drug-induced growth inhibition
was measured by mtt assay as described previously (17).
to determine the effect of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination after multiple exposures, mda-mb-231 cells were
seeded at 2  106 in t-225 flasks overnight. the various
combinations and treatment schemes are illustrated in
fig. 1. briefly, the cells were exposed to the combination regimens on a 10-day cycle. typically, exposures used
a 3-day treatment cycle with the cytotoxic agent (or
combination) and then were washed, counted, and replated
followed by a 7-day exposure either to  xxxd330xxx  or to
control medium. at the end of each treatment cycle, the
cells were trypsinized, when possible counted, replated,
and exposed to the same treatment regimen again. this
procedure was repeated 10 times. for the cytotoxic agent
alone regimen (fig. 1, scheme 1), the cells were exposed to
30 nmol/l paclitaxel, 50 nmol/l doxorubicin, or 5 amol/l
cisplatin alone for 3 days followed by 7 days in control
medium. for the sequential combination (fig. 1, scheme 2),
the cells were treated with a cytotoxic agent for 3 days
followed by 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  for 7 days. for the
simultaneous drug combination (fig. 1, scheme 3), the cells
were exposed to a cytotoxic agent and 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx 
for 3 days followed by a 7-day drug holiday. for the
combination of intermittent cytotoxic agent with continuous  xxxd330xxx  (fig. 1, scheme 4), the cells were exposed to
a cytotoxic agent and 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  for 3 days
followed by 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  for 7 days. control cells
were treated similarly with fresh medium containing
0.1% solvent (not shown in fig. 1). cell growth in the
presence of 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  either given continuously
or on a 7-day on, 3-day off cycle was also evaluated as an
additional control. drug-induced growth inhibition was
measured by trypan blue exclusion. the sensitivity of
resistant variants to various cytotoxic agents was evaluated
on 96-well tissue culture plates for 3 days. drug effect was
measured by mtt assay as described previously.
measurement of pgp activity
the degree of pgp efflux activity was quantified by
measuring the accumulation of a fluorescent pgp substrate
calcein in the cytosol according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (molecular probes, eugene, or). the intracellular accumulation of free calcein was measured with
a fluorescence microplate reader (biotek instruments,
winnoski, vt) at excitation/emission wavelength of 485/
530 nm.
rna preparation and quantitative real-time pcr
total rna was isolated using rneasy mini kit (qiagen,
valencia, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
rna samples were eluted in rnase-free water and stored
at 80jc. total rna (1 ag) was reverse transcribed into
cdna in a 50 al reaction volume containing 1 reverse
transcription buffer, 5.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 2 mmol/l
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 amol/l random hexamer, 0.4 unit rnase inhibitor, and 1.25 unit mulv reverse

transcriptase (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). human brain and liver cdna were used as standards
(ambion, austin, tx). the resulting cdna was diluted in
rnase-free water, aliquoted, and stored at 80jc. realtime pcr was done using a dual-fluorescent nonextendable
probe containing a 5v 6-carboxyfluorescein reporter dye
and a 3v 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (tamra).
cdnas (50 ng each) were used for real-time pcr in a final
volume of 50 al containing 1 taqman buffer (applied
biosystems), 300 nmol/l of each forward and reverse
primer, and 100 nmol/l probe. reactions were carried out

in an abi prism 7700 sequence detection system (applied
biosystems) for 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95jc and 60
seconds at 60jc. the level of expression of the target gene
was normalized to the expression level of the housekeeping
gene 36b4.

36b4,  xxxg13xxx ,  xxxg22xxx , and mvp and liver standard for
36b4,  xxxg10xxx ,  xxxg11xxx ,  xxxg15xxx , and  xxxg16xxx . the probes were
obtained from integrated dna technologies (coralville, ia).
cell invasion and angiogenesis assays
the invasion assay was carried out in a matrigel-coated
24-well transwell unit (bd biosciences, bedford, ma).
briefly, mda-mb-231 parental and drug-resistant cells
were grown in culture medium until 80% confluence. cells
were trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free medium,
and seeded at 1  105 in triplicate wells. the lower
chambers were filled with culture medium containing
5% fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant. the fraction
of cells invading into and through the matrigel matrix
after 18 to 20 hours was quantified by mtt assay. to
determine the ability of mda-mb-231 parental and drugresistant cells to modulate angiogenesis, 3  106 parental
cells or drug-resistant variants were cultured in 10 ml

serum-free medium. the conditioned medium was collected 48 hours later. huvecs (5  104) were seeded into the
upper chamber of the matrigel-coated transwells. the
conditioned medium from mda-mb-231 parental cells and
drug-resistant variants was used as chemoattractant and
added to the lower chambers. the fraction of cells invading
into and through the matrigel matrix after 24 hours was
quantified by mtt assay. results of invasiveness and
angiogenic potential were normalized with parental cells
and expressed as an invasion index.
fluctuation analysis
mda-mb-231 cells were seeded at 1,000 per flask in
75 cm2 tissue culture flasks. the flasks were divided into
two groups, with one group of cells grown in culture
medium and the other group in 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx . cells
were allowed to grow to 80% confluence (average of
4.2  106 cells per flask from cells grown in the culture
medium and 4.5  106 cells per flask from cells grown in
the  xxxd330xxx -containing medium). the total cell population from each flask from both treatment groups was
seeded onto separate 96-well plates overnight. for cultures
that contained >3.5  106 cells per flask, only 3.5  106 cells
were seeded on the plate to avoid high cell density per well.
cells grown in the culture medium during the expansion
period were treated with 30 nmol/l paclitaxel for 7 days,
whereas cells grown in 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  during the
expansion period were treated with a combination of
30 nmol/l paclitaxel and 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx . drugcontaining medium was changed every other day for 7 days
and then replaced by drug-free medium. surviving
colonies were counted 3 weeks later. in a control
experiment, the bulk population of mda-mb-231 cells
(4  107 cells at 2  106 cells per plate) without expansion of
the population before drug treatment was treated directly
with paclitaxel to determine the number of drug-resistant
variants in the total population. mutation rate was
calculated according to the method of catcheside (26).
in vivo animal studies
for the human xenograft tumor model, mda-mb-231
cells in log phase were harvested and resuspended in 1:1
(v/v) mixture of culture medium and matrigel (bd
biosciences, san diego, ca). tumor cells were implanted
s.c. into right and left axial regions of 6-week-old female
athymic nude mice (harlan, madison, wi) with 25 gauge
needle containing 5  106 cells/100 al. thereafter, fresh
tumors harvested from donor mice were minced into 1 to
3 mm3 in size. approximately 25 to 30 fragments in 1:1
culture medium and matrigel were injected s.c. into
recipient mice with a 16 gauge needle. this process was
repeated twice before initiation of the study. animals were
randomized 2 days after tumor injection. treatment began
when tumors were palpable (4 – 5 days after tumor
injection). each group consisted of 6 to 10 animals bearing
two tumors per animal.  xxxd330xxx  was prepared in an
aqueous solution containing 10% (v/v)  xxxd2982xxx 
(m r 400)/tween 80 (99.5:0.5) and 90% of 1% (w/v)
carboxymethylcellulose (sigma chemicals) and dosed

orally once daily at 100 mg/kg. doxorubicin and cisplatin
were dissolved in sterile saline. paclitaxel was prepared
freshly each time from the concentrated stock solution
(6 mg/ml) with sterile saline. the cytotoxic agents were
given i.p. once weekly. doses used for cytotoxic agents and
 xxxd330xxx  were at the maximum tolerated dose, the dose
that caused <10% weight loss during the study. animals
receiving no drugs were given vehicle for  xxxd330xxx  orally
daily and saline i.p. weekly. animals receiving  xxxd330xxx 
only were given saline i.p. once weekly; animals receiving
cytotoxic agent only were given vehicle for  xxxd330xxx 
orally daily. the treatment continued for 6 weeks. tumor
growth was measured with an electronic caliper (mitutoyo,
inc., utsunomiya, japan) twice weekly. tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula: 1/2ab 2, where a is the
longest and b is the shortest axis of the tumor. animal
weights were recorded once weekly. the animals used in
this study were housed in a u.s. department of agriculture – registered facility in accordance with nih guidelines
for the care and use of laboratory animals.
data analysis
dose-response curves for growth inhibition were generated and plotted as a percentage of untreated control. the
drug concentration needed to produce 50% growth
inhibition, ic50, was determined by nonlinear least squares
regression (jmp, cary, nc). differences in mean values
between groups were analyzed by unpaired student’s t test
with two-tailed comparison. multiple comparisons used
two-way anova followed by tukey-kramer test. differences of p < 0.05 are considered significant. software for
statistical analysis was by sigmastat (spss, inc.,
chicago, il).

results
effect of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination on the
development of acquired drug resistance in vitro
when used as a single agent, paclitaxel produced a
sigmoidal concentration-dependent growth inhibition in
mda-mb-231 cells with an ic50 of 3.17 f 0.2 nmol/l
(mean f sd, n = 3), whereas  xxxd330xxx  showed limited
growth inhibitory activity up to 10 amol/l.  xxxd330xxx  did
not interfere or enhance paclitaxel activity in various
combinations with paclitaxel after single exposure (data
not shown). to determine the effect of the  xxxd330xxx /
paclitaxel combination after multiple exposures, cells were
subjected to repeated treatment for 10 cycles (see fig. 1).
after four treatment cycles, paclitaxel activity was not
enhanced nor was it inhibited by the combination with
 xxxd330xxx  when compared with cells treated with paclitaxel alone (fig. 2a). cells treated with continuous
 xxxd330xxx  grew similarly as vehicle-treated cells (fig. 2a).
repeated treatment with intermittent paclitaxel alone
resulted in the development of paclitaxel resistance within
80 days (fig. 2b; fig. 1, scheme 1). treatment with
intermittent paclitaxel and continuous  xxxd330xxx  (fig. 1,
scheme 4) resulted in complete growth inhibition, whereas

effect of  xxxd330xxx  on the development of acquired drug resistance in
mda-mb-231 cells: (b) paclitaxel,
(c) doxorubicin, and (d) cisplatin.
mda-mb-231 cells were subjected
to various treatments as described in
fig. 1. at the end of each treatment
cycle (10 d), cells were harvested by
trypsinization. viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion
and reexposed to the same treatment. the procedure was repeated
10 times. because only 5% of the
cells for the vehicle control and
 xxxd330xxx -treated groups were
reseeded for the following cycle,
and assuming the growth rate of
these cells represents the growth
rate of the total population, projected
cell numbers were shown for these
two groups in a.

simultaneous combination (fig. 1, scheme 3) delayed the
development of paclitaxel resistance for 1 and 2 months,
respectively, compared with cells treated with paclitaxel
alone (fig. 2b). repeated exposure to  xxxd330xxx  for 10
cycles did not alter cell growth (data not shown).
because the combination of intermittent paclitaxel and
continuous  xxxd330xxx  prevented the development of
paclitaxel resistance, we sought to determine whether
this treatment regimen could be applied to other
cytotoxic agents to prevent or delay acquired drug
resistance. two additional cytotoxic compounds, doxorubicin (a pgp substrate) and cisplatin (a non-pgp substrate), were used to evaluate the efficacy of the
 xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination. similar to paclitaxel,
 xxxd330xxx  did not interfere with the activity of either
doxorubicin or cisplatin after single exposure (data not
shown). repeated exposures to the single cytotoxic agent
alone resulted in development of acquired drug resistance, whereas the combination treatment delayed the
growth of the cells (fig. 2c and d) and remained
chemosensitive (see below).
characteristics of resistant variants
the surviving cells after prolonged treatment with a
single cytotoxic agent or with  xxxd330xxx  were isolated and
evaluated for their drug sensitivity. cells isolated from

paclitaxel or doxorubicin alone were cross-resistant to other
pgp substrates but responded to the non-pgp substrate
cisplatin (table 1a and b). cells isolated from the cisplatintreated culture were resistant to cisplatin alone (table 1c).
on the other hand, the surviving cells isolated from the
intermittent cytotoxic agent and continuous  xxxd330xxx 
(fig. 1, scheme 4) remained chemosensitive toward all the
compounds tested (table 1).
it was apparent that the resistant cells isolated from
the various  xxxd330xxx /paclitaxel combinations showed
a differential multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotype
(table 1a). the resistant cells from the sequential combination (fig. 1, scheme 2) showed a 20-fold resistance to
tubulin agents and a 3-fold resistance to doxorubicin,
whereas the resistant cells from the simultaneous combination (fig. 1, scheme 3) showed a 6-fold resistance to
paclitaxel but were sensitive to other tubulin agents and
doxorubicin. to further examine the mechanism of the
mdr phenotype in paclitaxel-resistant cells, the efflux
activity of pgp and  xxxg10xxx  gene expression was determined.
as seen in fig. 3a, the extent of paclitaxel resistance (table
1a) was correlated with the efflux activity of pgp, being
highest in paclitaxel-resistant cells followed by cells
derived from the sequential combination and lowest in
cells derived from simultaneous combination. addition of

note: mean f sd, n = 3 from three separate experiments. mda-mb-231 parent cells and cells recovered from the cytotoxic agent treatment
alone or from the combination were tested for the sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin at various concentrations
for 3 days. drug effects were measured by mtt assay. ic50, the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of cell growth for each drug, was
determined. results were normalized with the parental cells and expressed as the resistant factor (rf).

 xxxd330xxx  had no effect on the efflux activity in the
paclitaxel-resistant cells, whereas the pgp inhibitor verapamil significantly decreased the efflux activity of pgp in
these cells (data not shown). to elucidate the mechanism of
increased pgp efflux activity in the resistant cells, real-time
pcr was used to analyze mrna levels for genes known to
be involved in drug resistance:  xxxg10xxx  (pgp),  xxxg11xxx  (mdr/
tap),  xxxg13xxx  ( xxxg13xxx   xxxg1448xxx ),  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx ),  xxxg16xxx  ( xxxg16xxx ),  xxxg22xxx 
(breast cancer – resistant protein), and mvp (lung-resistant
protein). our data showed that  xxxg10xxx  mrna was barely
detected in mda-mb-231 parental cells or cells treated
with  xxxd330xxx  but was increased f150-fold in cells
treated with paclitaxel alone, 50-fold in cells treated with
sequential combination, and 20-fold in cells treated with
simultaneous combination (fig. 3b). the expression of
other resistant genes was not altered in the paclitaxelresistant variants (data not shown). the level of  xxxg10xxx 
mrna expression was consistent with the degree of efflux
activity of pgp and mdr phenotype (compare fig. 3 and
table 1a). taken together, these results showed that
increased  xxxg10xxx  mrna expression was responsible for the
mdr phenotype in paclitaxel-resistant cells. our data
further showed that  xxxd330xxx  can influence the mdr
phenotype in paclitaxel-resistant cells through modulation
of  xxxg10xxx  mrna expression.

830  xxxd330xxx  and drug resistance in breast carcinoma

effect of  xxxd330xxx  on invasion and angiogenic
ability
several lines of evidence have suggested that tumor cells
selected for drug resistance are more invasive than their
parental cells (27, 28). to determine whether  xxxd330xxx 
can influence invasiveness and angiogenesis, cells derived
from single cytotoxic agents (drug-resistant) and from the
combination (drug-sensitive) were subjected to matrigel
invasion and angiogenesis assays. as seen in fig. 5, drugresistant cells showed a 2-fold increase in invasiveness and
angiogenic potential compared with the parental cells. in
contrast, cells treated with the combination regimen
showed a 50% reduction in invasiveness and angiogenic
ability compared with the parental cells. the extent of
invasiveness and angiogenesis of these cells was further
correlated with the degree of drug resistance (see table 1).
resistant cells that were treated with  xxxd330xxx  alone or in
combination also showed a decreased invasiveness and
angiogenic ability compared with cells treated with single
cytotoxic agents (data not shown).

figure 4. effect of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination on reversal of
acquired drug resistance: (a) paclitaxel, (b) doxorubicin, and (c) cisplatin.
paclitaxel-, doxorubicin-, or cisplatin-resistant mda-mb-231 cells were
repeatedly treated with vehicle, cytotoxic agent alone,  xxxd330xxx  alone,
or intermittent drug with continuous  xxxd330xxx . parental cells were used
as reference control and treated with a given cytotoxic drug for 3 d. viable
cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion at the end of each
treatment cycle. points, mean (n = 3); bars, sd.

effect on the growth of drug-resistant cells. however, the
drug-resistant cells were resensitized to the cytotoxic agent
after multiple exposures to the  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic
combination (fig. 4a – c). in general, the reversal of drug
resistance became apparent after repeated treatment for
three cycles. the remaining viable fraction of cells
continued to decrease with increasing treatment cycles,
reaching <1% of untreated control after 8 to 10 treatment
cycles.

effect of  xxxd330xxx  on mutation rate
the ability of  xxxd330xxx  to prevent and overcome
multidrug resistance and reduce invasion and angiogenesis
suggested that  xxxd330xxx  may maintain and/or increase
genomic integrity of the cells to prevent the cancer cell from
modifying its genome resulting in the acquisition of drug
resistance. to test this possibility, the effect of  xxxd330xxx 
on the frequency of developing drug resistance was
evaluated using luria-delbrück fluctuation analysis (29).
as seen in table 2, no surviving clones were found in the
bulk population of 2  107 cells treated with paclitaxel in a
single step (control group), indicating that preexisting
paclitaxel-resistant variants in the mda-mb-231 cell
population was minimal. in the fluctuation groups, the
average number of colonies per plate in paclitaxel-selected
cells was 2.4, whereas the average number of colonies per
plate in the  xxxd330xxx -treated cultures decreased 6-fold.
because the variance in the number of surviving colonies
per plate exceeded the mean in the fluctuation groups, the
above findings suggested that paclitaxel resistance in these
clones arose spontaneously rather than being induced by
environmental selection. the mutation rate in the cells
expanded in control medium was calculated to be 7.3 
10 8 per cell generation, whereas those treated with
 xxxd330xxx  during the expansion period had a 7-fold
reduction in the mutation rate (p < 0.05, t test). similar
results were obtained by mss maximum likelihood method
(ref. 30; data not shown). the above findings suggest that
the interference with developing paclitaxel resistance by
the combination was due to a reduction in the spontaneous
mutation rate by  xxxd330xxx .
effect of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination in vivo
as seen in fig. 6, mda-mb-231 tumors grew continuously throughout the course of study in both control and drugtreated animals. when compared with vehicle control,
 xxxd330xxx  given alone at 100 mg/kg daily had no effect on
tumor growth. treatment with doxorubicin (5 mg/kg)

invading into and through the matrigel matrix was quantified by mtt assay. huvecs (5  104) were seeded onto the upper chamber of the matrigel-coated

fig. 6b), whereas no significant difference in tumor
volumes were seen in animals treated with paclitaxel
(20 mg/kg) or cisplatin (5 mg/kg) relative to the vehicle
control (fig. 6a and c). on the other hand, the combination
of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic agent reduced tumor volume by
f40% relative to cytotoxic agents alone (p < 0.05 in all
cases) and by 60% relative to vehicle control (p < 0.05 in all
cases). the benefit of adding  xxxd330xxx  to the cytotoxic
regimen became apparent beyond 3 weeks as the tumor
volume in mice receiving the combination therapy began to
diverge from the tumor volume in mice treated with the
cytotoxic agent alone. in a separate study, animals were
treated with paclitaxel for 2 weeks followed by the
 xxxd330xxx /paclitaxel combination. our data showed that
treatment with paclitaxel followed by the combination
resulted in a 40% decrease in tumor growth compared with
paclitaxel alone (fig. 6d). taken together, the above
findings indicated that the combination regimen produced
significant decrease in tumor volume than single agents in
mda-mb-231 xenograft model. our data further showed
that treatment with a single cytotoxic agent followed by the
combination resulted in a much greater delay in tumor
growth compared with the single cytotoxic agent alone.

discussion
the present study shows that the  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic
combination can delay or prevent the development of
acquired drug resistance in mda-mb-231 cells. the
extent of acquired paclitaxel resistance correlated with
the mdr phenotype and efflux activity of pgp and  xxxg10xxx 
gene expression. cells with acquired drug resistance
(paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin), when treated with
a  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination, were resensitized to
the cytotoxic agent. interestingly, cells treated with the
combination regimen showed reduced invasiveness and
angiogenic ability than their resistant counterparts. the
in vivo mda-mb-231 xenograft model showed that the
 xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination produced a statistically
significant greater antitumor efficacy than single agents.
our findings suggest that the  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic
combination may be an efficacious treatment for advanced breast cancer by interfering with tumor cell
progression to a more malignant drug-resistant, invasive
phenotype.
genetic instability of cancer cells is thought to be one of
the major factors giving rise to drug-resistant mutant or
variant subpopulations (31, 32). our data show that longterm exposure to the  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination can

note: individual populations at 1,000 cells per flask were allowed to
expand in either the culture medium or 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  until 80%
confluence. the total cell population from each flask was seeded onto
separate 96-well plates and exposed to 30 nmol/l paclitaxel. cells grown in
1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx  during expansion period were treated with combination of 30 nmol/l paclitaxel and 1 amol/l  xxxd330xxx . treatment was

delay and overcome acquired drug resistance and decrease
invasive and angiogenic capacity. we hypothesize that
 xxxd330xxx  may increase and/or maintain the genomic
integrity of cells to prevent the cancer cell from modifying
its genome resulting in the development of acquired drug
resistance. this hypothesis was further supported by luriadelbrück fluctuation analysis. as seen in table 2, treatment
with  xxxd330xxx  decreased the spontaneous development of
paclitaxel resistance. in theory, if resistance was induced by
drug selection, the number of surviving colonies would be
expected to have a poisson distribution, with the variance
close to the mean (29). our data showed that the variance in
the number of surviving colonies per plate was much
greater than the mean, indicating that paclitaxel-resistant
variants in mda-mb-231 cells arose randomly rather than
being induced by drug exposure. because pretreatment
with  xxxd330xxx  followed by drug selection significantly

decreased the spontaneous mutation rate compared with
expansion without  xxxd330xxx , this suggests that  xxxd330xxx 
can maintain/increase genomic integrity of the tumor cells
by interfering with the acquisition of spontaneous mutations that result in drug resistance.
the molecular mechanism by which  xxxd330xxx  modulates drug-resistant genes and maintains genomic
integrity is unknown at present. several possibilities
exist. first, the tumor suppressor gene p53 functions to
maintain genomic integrity by preventing cells with
unstable genomes from transiting through the cell cycle.
the functional role of p53 as a central mediator of the
dna damage and regulation of apoptosis is well
established (33, 34). in addition, wild-type p53 has been
shown to repress  xxxg10xxx  promoter activity,  xxxg10xxx  expression,
and pgp protein level, whereas mutant p53 stimulates such
effects (35 – 37). recent studies have indicated that a small
ubiquitin-like modifier protein is involved in p53 stability,
function, and transcriptional regulation and genomic stability (38, 39). the accumulated evidence suggests the
important role of wild-type p53 in dna repair, regulation
of apoptosis pathways, and  xxxg10xxx  gene expression level.
mda-mb-231 human breast cancer cells contain mutant p53
(22). it is possible that  xxxd330xxx  may interfere with mutant
p53-mediated cell survival after multiple exposures to
cytotoxic agents through inhibiting mutant p53 activity
and/or restoring a wild-type p53 phenotype. second,
aneuploidy is one of the most common genomic abnormalities of cancer cells (40). early studies by duesberg et al.
showed that genomic instability of cancer cells was
proportional to the degree of aneuploidy (41). these
investigators further showed that aneuploid cells can
acquire multidrug resistance by chromosome reassortments
in the absence of multidrug resistance genes (42). thus,
 xxxd330xxx  may maintain/increase genomic integrity
through stabilizing dna ploidy. third, the nuclear factornb has been shown to play an important role in controlling
apoptotic cell death (43, 44) and the expression of the  xxxg10xxx 
gene (45). furthermore, we have recently shown that a novel
rexinoid  xxxd1077xxx  inhibited nuclear factor-nb activity to
increase the activity of chemotherapeutic agents (46). it is
possible that  xxxd330xxx  may interfere with drug-resistant
gene expression through inhibition of nuclear factor-nb to
prevent and overcome multidrug resistance. fourth, the
 xxxg1598xxx  is a member of the nuclear
 xxxg1603xxx  superfamily that heterodimerizes with
retinoid x receptor. it was reported that paclitaxel could
enhance  xxxg10xxx  gene expression through the steroid and
xenobiotic receptor in both primary hepatocytes and colon
cancer cells, thereby increasing its own clearance and
leading to the development of drug resistance (47). the
 xxxg1598xxx  was also found to be
involved in cisplatin resistance by inducing glutathione stransferase expression in endometrial cancer cells (48).
 xxxd330xxx  may directly or indirectly antagonize the steroid
and xenobiotic receptor activity to prevent paclitaxel- and
cisplatin-induced expression of drug-resistant genes. taken
together,  xxxd330xxx  may interfere with one or more of the

above-mentioned pathways to suppress multidrug resistance
gene expression. ongoing research focuses on elucidating the
mechanism of action of  xxxd330xxx  in maintaining genomic
integrity to prevent and overcome multidrug resistance.
in the present study, we observed that cells that
developed acquired drug resistance showed an increased
invasiveness and angiogenic potential, whereas cells
treated with the combination regimen were chemosensitive
and had reduced invasive and angiogenic ability. coexpression of drug resistance and invasion/metastasis has
been observed in patient samples (49, 50). cells that
coexpress these properties are due either to selection of
more aggressive cells or to increase in the metastatic
potential following chemotherapeutic insults (27). it is
likely that the  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic combination interfered
with increased survival and tumor progression after drug
exposure through maintaining and/or increasing genomic
integrity. using cdna microarray analysis, we have
recently identified several  xxxd330xxx -regulated genes,
many of which were important for drug resistance,
metastasis, and angiogenesis.1 we are currently evaluating
the functional roles of these genes.
our present findings have important implications for
patients with breast cancer as well as other diseases. for
example, we have recently reported that the  xxxd330xxx /
paclitaxel combination delayed and overcame paclitaxel
resistance in non – small cell lung cancer (51). in addition,
the results from a recent phase i/ii clinical trials showed
that addition of  xxxd330xxx  capsules to cisplatin/vinorelbine

chemotherapy extends survival in late-stage non – small cell
lung cancer patients (52). ongoing research is directed
toward understanding the mechanisms by which  xxxd330xxx  prevents and overcomes acquired and intrinsic drug
resistance. information obtained from these studies will
have significant impact on the therapeutic use of  xxxd330xxx  in cancer treatment.
