blockade of epithelial nall channels by triamterenes - underlying mechanisms
and molecular basis
received: 2 january 1996/accepted: 17 may 1996

abstract the three subunits (a, /3, y) encoding for the
rat epithelial na' channel (renac) were expressed in
xenopus oocytes, and the induced na' conductance
was tested for its sensitivity to various triamterene
derivatives. triamterene blocked renac in a voltagedependent manner, and was 100-fold less potent than
amiloride at ph 7.5. at —90 mv and —40 mv, the
ic 50 values were 5 tm and 10 µm, respectively. the
blockage by triamterene, which is a weak base with a
pk. of 6.2, was dependent on the extracellular ph. the
ic 50 was 1 pm at ph 6.5 and only 17 µm at ph 8.5,
suggesting that the protonated compound is more
potent than the unprotonated one. according to a simple kinetic analysis, the apparent inhibition constants
at —90 mv were 0.74 pm for the charged and
100.6 pm for the uncharged triamterene. the main
metabolite of triamterene, p-hydroxytriamterene  xxxd3258xxx , inhibited renac with an approximately
twofold lower affinity. derivatives of triamterene, in
which the p-position of the phenylmoiety was substituted by acidic or basic residues, inhibited renac with
ic 50 values in the range of 0.1-20 µm. acidic and basic
triamterenes produced a renac blockade with a
similar voltage and ph dependence as the parent
compound, suggesting that the pteridinemoiety of
triamterene is responsible for that characteristic.

expression of the renac co-subunit-deletion mutant,
a278-283, which lacks a putative amiloride-binding
site, induced a na' channel with a greatly reduced
affinity for both triamterene and amiloride. in summary, renac is a molecular target for triamterene that
binds to its binding site within the electrical field,
preferably as a positively charged molecule in a voltage- and ph-dependent fashion. we propose that
amiloride and triamterene bind to renac using very
similar mechanisms.

introduction

the epithelial na' channel plays an important role in
epithelial na -' absorption in the distal colon, urinary
bladder, salivary and sweat ducts, respiratory tract and,
most importantly, in the distal tubules of the kidney
[7, 8, 11, 15]. regulation of this epithelial na' channel
has a major impact on na' balance, blood volume and,
consequently, blood pressure. therefore, an inhibition
of epithelial na t -channel expression by aldosterone
antagonists [6], or direct blockade by amiloride or triamterene together with loop diuretics and thiazides are
used for the treatment of hypertension [6]. recently,
the genes encoding for three homologous subunits (a,
/3 and y) of the rat epithelial na' channel (renac) have
been cloned [4, 5]. expression of these subunits in
xenopus oocytes induced an amiloride-blockable na'
channel that exhibited the usual epithelial na + -channel characteristics, in numerous tissues [5]. however,
little is known about the triamterene sensitivity of
epithelial na' channels [20]. for several triamterene
derivatives, distinct effects on the excretion of na t , k +
and mgt were observed in vivo [13, 19]. in addition,
certain triamterene derivatives exerted antiarrhythmic

761

effects in the heart in both in vivo and in vitro studies
[1, 2]. in the present study, we were therefore interested
in the sensitivity of renac to triamterene and several
triamterene derivatives with distinct antikaliuretic
profiles [13]. moreover, we wanted to analyze the
influence of membrane potential and ph on renac
blockade by triamterene and amiloride, because in certain tissues these parameters have been shown to affect
the effects of amiloride and triamterene on epithelial
na channels [16, 21].

the ampicillin repair oligonucleotide and the oligonucleotide primer
carrying the deletion mutant, a278-283. correct mutation was
confirmed using the prism cycle sequencing kit (perkin elmer)
and an automated sequencer (pharmacia, germany).

voltage clamp in xenopus oocytes
the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp configuration was used to
record currents from xenopus laevis oocytes, 2-8 days after crna
injection. recordings were performed at 22 °c using a geneclamp
amplifier (axon instruments, foster city, calif., usa), and
maclab d/a converter and software for data acquisition and
analysis (ad instruments, castle hill, australia). the nd 96 solution (control) contained (mm):  xxxg2020xxx  96, kcl 2,  xxxg2125xxx , 1.8, mgcl 2
1, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes) 5
(titrated with naoh to ph 7.5). for some experiments the ph of
the nd 96 solution was adjusted to either 5.5, 6.5, 8.5 or 9.5, by
titration with hcl or naoh. as indicated below, in some experiments na' was replaced by n-methyl-d-glucamine (nmdg) solution. the microelectrodes were filled with 3 m kcl solution and
had resistances in the range 0.5-0.9  xxxg1394xxx . chemicals used were:
amiloride (sigma) and triamterene (gift from procter and gamble).
the triamterene derivatives used are given in table 1. they were
also a gift from procter and gamble. the amplitude of the induced
na' currents varied considerably, depending on the day of channel expression and the batch of oocytes. furthermore, the mutant
channel, a278-283, induced considerably smaller currents than the
wild-type channel. for studies with this mutant we selected only
oocytes that produced inward currents >0.1 µa at —90 mv (1 out
of 10 injected oocytes; determined by replacement of na' with
nmdg). throughout this study, the total na' current amplitude

materials and methods
oocyte handling, rna synthesis and mutagenesis
the handling and injection of xenopus oocytes and synthesis of
crna have been described previously, in detail [3]. one day after
dissection, oocytes were selected and injected with the appropriate
crna encoding for the a-, a278-283, /3- and y-subunits of renac
[5]. the crna for the wild-type a-subunit or its mutant, a278-283,
was always coinjected with an equal amount of /3- and y-subunit
crna (10 ng/oocyte).
the deletion mutation, 0278-283, in the a-subunit was produced
by subcloning the a-renac fragment into p alter vector (altered
sites in vitro mutagenesis system, promega, heidelberg, germany).
single-stranded cdna was obtained using helper phage r 408.
synthesis of mutated a-renac-cdna was induced by annealing of

was determined at least once for each experimental day by superfusion with nmdg solution, or with a 3 pm or 5 pm amiloride
solution at the beginning and at the end of each set of experiments.
the amiloride-sensitive na' current decreased during the timecourse of the individual experiments (approximately 15 min) to
73.9 ± 3.9'% (n = 17) of the value at the beginning of the experiments. data are presented as means with standard errors (sem),
where n represents the number of experiments performed. a paired
student's t-test was used to test for statistical significance the level
of which was set at p < 0.05.

results
xenopus oocytes that expressed renac produced large
inward currents at —90 mv, varying from approximately — 300 na to —4 to at days 1 and 5 after crna
injection. these currents were completely abolished in
the absence of extracellular na' (nmdg solution) or
in the presence of 3-5 tm amiloride (n = 90; data not
shown; [5]), in accordance with what has been described
previously. superfusion of the oocytes with 100 pm triamterene resulted in an almost complete block of the
renac-induced inward currents (n = 5; fig. ia). the
addition of 100 tm triamterene did not significantly
alter the effects of a saturating concentration of
amiloride (3 µm) on the holding current (n = 5; fig.
ia). neither procedure affected significantly the holding current of control (non-injected) oocytes (n = 6;
fig. 1b).
subsequently we analyzed the concentration inhibition relationship of the triamterene-mediated renac
blockade. as shown in fig. 2, triamterene produced a
concentration-dependent blockade of renac, with an
ic s0 value of 5.6 ± 0.3 µm at a holding potential of
fig. 1 effects of triamterene at ph 7.5 on a oocytes expressing rat
epithelial na channels (renac) and b control oocytes. a renacexpressing oocytes produced large inward currents at —90 mv,
which were almost completely abolished by 100 pm triamterene.
amiloride (3 µm) exerted the same effect, and the addition of triamterene did not increase significantly the amiloride-mediated
renac blockade. b in control oocytes, only small triamterene- and
amiloride-insensitive leakage currents were observed at —90 mv.

—90 mv (fig. 2a, c; n = 10). under the same conditions, amiloride produced a renac blockade with
an ic 50 value of 53.9 ± 5.7 nm (n = 6). the blockade
by both k + -retaining diuretics depended on the membrane potential. at —40 mv, triamterene and
amiloride blocked the renac, with ic 50 values of
10.0 ± 1.4 pm (fig. 2b, c; n = 10) and 98.0 ± 16.7 nm
(n = 6), respectively.
amiloride is a relatively strong base with a pka of
8.7, and the protonated form is thought to be the more
effective channel blocker [14, 17, 21]. in contrast, triamterene is a weak base with a pka of 6.2 and, at physiological ph, most of the compound is unprotonated.
we were therefore interested in the ph dependence of
the effects of triamterene on renac and recorded the
inhibition of renac-mediated inward current, which
was exerted by triamterene in solutions with ph values in the range 5.5-9.5. the holding potential was

the blockade by triamterene was normalized against the maximal
observed blockade at the respective potentials. the data were fitted
to a hill equation with a variable maxmum. at —90 mv, the
extrapolated maximal inhibition was not significantly different from
the renac inhibition that was caused by 100 pm triamterene. the

—90 mv. changes in solution ph did not alter the voltage dependence of the triamterene-mediated blockage
of renac (data not shown). however, the decrease in
ph increased systematically the inhibitory potency of
triamterene (fig. 3a), suggesting that, as in the case of
amiloride, the protonated compound was the more
effective blocker. by fitting the data using the massaction relationship (solid lines in fig. 3a), apparent
inhibition constants (km p) were obtained. in fig. 3b,
the values of km p were plotted against the ph of the
triamterene solutions used.
to interpret these data quantitatively, simple blocking kinetics for the protonated (concentration t +) and
unprotonated triamterene (concentration t °) were considered. from the probability of the channel being open
in the presence of triamterene, we obtained the prediction:
kkp= 1/[(t + /(t + +t °))ikm++(1 —b)/k °m](1)
where km and km' are the inhibition constants for the
charged and uncharged compound, and t+/
(t + + t ° ) = 10 —p h /(10 — p h + 10 — p k a). in fig. 3b, the
arrow points to the relationship predicted by eq. 1 for
km = 0.73 µm, k°m = oo and pka = 6.2. the dashed lines
represent predictions for korn = 250, 125, 80 and 50 µm
(from left to right). while these relationships did not
match the data, the plots nevertheless suggested that
resealing of the ph variable might achieve a fit.
therefore, a parameter aph was introduced, to allow
for a systematic deviation of the local ph at the outer
membrane surface from the ph of the bulk solution.
using:
ph10 ,1 = pheulk + aph, (2)
introduced into the expression for b (in eq. 1), the data
were fitted to eq. 1, and yielded the solid line passing
through the data points in fig. 3b. we thus obtained
the parameter values aph = —0.881, km = 0.74 µm,
km° = 100.6 µm. in fig. 3b, a weak blocking effect
exerted by the uncharged form of triamterene (t°)
caused the slope of the right branch of the curve to
become smaller. this is shown by the dashed curves, for
which kron was systematically decreased (see legend).
therefore, when k°m was set to infinity, the theoretical
curve was too steep, irrespective of aph, and the fit to
the data points was not satisfactory. in the framework
of the kinetic blocking model used, these results indicate that (1) a local ph near the blocking site, lower than
that of the bulk solution, determined the equilibrium
between t+ and t ° ; (2) both t+ and to contributed to
the overall blockage effect; and (3) the blocking efficacy
of t + was 136-fold larger than that of t ° .
subsequently we analyzed the concentration/blockade relationship of several triamterene derivatives,
including the main metabolite of triamterene,
p-hydroxytriamterene  xxxd3258xxx  (chemical
structures and ic 50 values are given in table 1; concentration/blockade relationships are given in fig. 4).

bulk solution, and km r the apparant value of the inhibition constant (both in µm). a stoichiometry of one blocker molecule per

derived from panel a, were plotted against the ph of the bulk solution. the arrow points to a predicted relationship for the case where
only the charged form of triamterene, at concentration t+, blocks
the channel (eq. 1 with k° = —). the inhibition constant of this
process, km, was set at 0.74 pm, and the pka of triamterene to 6.2
[13,19]. the dashed lines allow for the possibility that the uncharged
form of triamterene, at concentration t ° , can also block the channel (eq. 1). the inhibition constant of this process, k/., was set at
250, 125, 80 and 50 pm (from left to right). the relationships thus
predicted had attenuated slopes, but did not fit the data. finally,
a parameter aph was introduction, which allowed for the possibility that the local ph at the outer surface of the membrane differed
from that of the bulk solution (eq. 2). curve-fitting with this model
yielded the solid line that passes through the data points. the parameter values were aph = —0.881, km= 0.74 pm, k m = 100 pm

3048, which are basic and acidic hydrophilic triamterene derivatives, respectively, blocked renac with
an ic 50 value of 2.5 ± 0.6 tm (n = 5), respectively. rph
2964, a basic hydrophobic triamterene derivative, was
the most potent renac blocker, with an ic 50 value of
94.7 ± 12.5 nm (n = 5). taken together, these findings
correlate with the antikaliuretic potency of these substances that have been described previously in in vitro
studies (see tablel; [9, 12, 18]). as is the case for triamterene and amiloride, the ic 50 value for all triamterene derivatives was shifted to higher values at
—40 mv (data not shown).
in another set of experiments, we analyzed the ph
dependence of renac blockade by amiloride, the
fig. 5 ph dependence of
renac blockade by amiloride,
triamterene, the basic
triamterene derivative rph
2964, and the acidic

acidic triamterene derivative rph 3048, and the basic
derivative rph 2964. these compounds were superfused at ph 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 (the holding potential was
—90 mv) at the concentrations that corresponded
approximately to their ic so value under control conditions (ph 7.5; —90 mv). at 100 nm amiloride, there
was virtually no difference in the extent of renac
blockade at either ph 6.5 or 7.5 (n = 5). however, an
increase in ph to 8.5 significantly decreased the
amiloride-mediated renac blockade (fig. 5; n = 5). in
contrast, for both acidic and basic triamterene derivatives, there were significant differences in the extent of
renac blockade at ph 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 (fig.5; n = 5).
as for triamterene, both of these compounds were more
effective at an acidic ph.
raising antibodies against amiloride, lin et al. [10]
identified a putative binding site for amiloride, corresponding to sequence 278-283 of the renac co-subunit. to test the hypothesis that this putative binding
site is involved in amiloride- and triamterene-mediated
renac inhibition, we produced a deletion mutant
(0278-283) and coexpressed it with the fi- and y-renac
subunits. expression of the mutant in xenopus oocytes
also induced an inward current, which could be
completely abolished by replacing extracellular na'
with nmdg. however, on average the mutant-induced
na' currents were much smaller than the wild-type
currents. therefore we selected only oocytes with a
na' current (at —90 mv) larger than 100 na for
the analysis of triamterene- and amiloride-mediated
inhibition. as shown in fig. 6, the mutant-induced
currents were much less sensitive to amiloride and
triamterene. triamterene, at 100 µm, a saturating
concentration for wild-type renac blockade, inhibited the mutant renac by 5.7 ± 0.3 % ( n = 5), and
the ic 50 value for amiloride was 3.44 ± 0.19 µm
(n = 5), about 100-fold higher than for the wild-type
(fig. 6a,b).

discussion

the present study demonstrates the blockade of renac
by triamterene and several of its derivatives. moreover,
the data suggest a similar binding region at the renac,
and a similar blocking mechanism for these compounds
and amiloride. all triamterenes block renac with a
rank order of potency correlating with their antikaliuretic effects in vivo [9, 12, 18], suggesting that renac
blockade in the collecting duct is the major diuretic
mechanism of triamterene.
the affinity of both amiloride and triamterene is
clearly dependent on the membrane potential and is
greater at more negative potentials. this suggests that
both drugs bind to renac mainly as protonated molecules within the electrical field, as has been suggested
for amiloride binding in studies using toad bladder [14,
21]. the results showing the unaltered voltage  xxxd2870xxx -

dence of triamterene derivatives with negatively or positively charged substitutions at the phenyl moiety also
indicate the orientation of the triamterene molecule
within the membrane. the lack of an effect of these
charged side chains on the voltage dependence of the
block may be due to a location of these residues outside of the electrical field. amiloride binding to renac
has been shown to occur where the field strength is
approximately 20°/) of the maximum, corresponding to
a distance of 6 a (0.6 nm) within the membrane
[14, 21]. assuming a similar value for triamterene, the
estimated distance of 10 a (1 nm) between one end of
the positively charged pteridine moiety and the side
chains of the phenyl moiety is large enough to allow
the side chain to stick out of the membrane. on the
other hand, the fact that the side chains can affect the
affinity of triamterenes to renac suggests that these
moieties can interact with another distinct region at
the outer entrance of the channel.
the strong ph dependence of the triamterene-mediated renac blockage suggested that the different
degree of blocker protonation may be the main reason
for the difference between the apparent inhibition constants, k p, of amiloride and triamterene. while
amiloride is almost completely protonated at physiological ph, triamterene is mainly unprotonated. its
blocking potency increased greatly, however, when the
ph was lowered. we found that the empirical relationship between and solution ph could be interpreted quantitatively, when allowing for the possibility
that the local ph at the membrane was 0.881 ph units
smaller than in the bulk solution. the local proton concentration would thus be 7.6-fold larger than in the
bulk phase. this is a reasonable value, which implies
an effective surface potential of —51 mv due to negative fixed charges. our results do not allow the distinction between the effects of negative fixed charges in
the cortical layer of the oocyte and those at the channel entrance. however, if the protonation reaction of
triamterene were fast with respect to diffusion times,
then it would be the fixed charge density at the channel entrance which determined the local ph and,
thereby, the equilibrium between t+ and t°. our data
are consistent with the blockage of renac caused by
the protonated and unprotonated triamterene.
however, the protonated triamterene was by far the
more effective blocker. the values at —90 mv were
0.74 µm for t + and 100.6 tm for t°.
these data and similarities in their chemical structure suggest similar mechanisms underlying amiloride
and triamterene binding to renac. further support of
this notion is provided by the reduced binding of both
triamterene and amiloride to the renac deletion
mutant that lacks a putative amiloride-binding site.
however, the fact that the mutant could still be blocked
by amiloride and triamterene (although with a much
lower affinity) suggests that other regions of the renac
are also involved in the binding of these compounds.

further studies are required to complete our understanding of the molecular basis of renac blockade by
triamterene and amiloride.
