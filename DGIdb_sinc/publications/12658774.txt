summary: in order to further investigate the effect of annexin~ (ann- ~ ) on tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx )-dependent plasminogen (plg)activation and its interactive mechanism, recombinant
native ann- 1i bound  xxxg1766xxx , plg and plasmin with high affinity was examined. the flow cytometric
assay showed that the ann- g expression rate was higher in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(huvec) (87.65 %) than in the hl-60 cells as controls (35. 79 %). two irrelevant proteins,
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) and equine igg (eig) had no effect on the production of plasmin.
ann- i -mediated enhancement of  xxxg1766xxx -dependent plg activation was inhibited by t- xxxd146xxx 
acid or by pretreatment of ann- ~ with  xxxg502xxx  with the inhibitive rate being 77.8 % and
77.0 ~ , respectively. it was revealed that the effect of ann- ~ on pi.g activation was specific for tpa. urokinase didn't bind to ann- i , demonstrating the role of receptor-related lysine residues on
activation of plg, showing that the ann- ~ -plg interaction was dependent upon carboxyl-terminal
lysine residues. these findings suggest that annexin 11-mediated co-assembly of  xxxg1766xxx  and plg may
promote plasmin generation and play a key role in modulating fibrinolysis on the endothelial surface.

 xxxg164xxx  , a calcium-dependent phospholipid
binding protein with molecular weight of 36 kd, is a
member of annexin family consisting of 13 members
in mammalians. this phospholipid-binding protein is
distinct from the urokinase receptor and from other
known cellular binding sites for plasminogen ( p l g )
and tissue plasminogen activator ( t - p a ) . endothelial
cells express abundant binding sites for the fibrinolytic zymogen and t - p a . binding of plg to endothelial
cells enhances the catalytic efficiency of its activation
by  xxxg1766xxx . celt surface plasmin activity may contribute
to several endothelial cell functions including thromboresistance, angiogenesis, and activator of growth
and differentiation factors [~. recent studies have
suggested  xxxg164xxx  excrete from and express on
colon adenocarcinoma cells, large-cell lymphoma
cells, chondrocytes, and endothelial cells, possibly
via extrusion of microvesicles. annexin k possesses a
variable amino-terminal "tail" domain followed by a
conserved " c o r e " region that imparts membranebinding capability. the latter consists of either four
or eight homologous "endonexin" motifs which contain the general consensus sequence ( i . / m ) - k - g - x g - t - ( 3 8 r e s i d u e s ) - ( d / e ) :2'aj. it is not yet clear
what role ann- ~ may play maintaining intravascular
as well as extravascular homeostasis in vivo and in
vitro. in the present study, we identified annexin
as an endothelial cell surface co-receptor for p l g and
t - p a and examined the mechanism by which annexin
associates with the endothelial cell surface. the
data indicate that this interaction is an equilibriumbased, calcium-dependent binding event, with an abzhang xiaohui, male, born in 1966, associate professor

solute requirement for a carboxyl terminal lysine-dependent mechanism. these findings suggest that calcium-medicated binding of annexin 11 to the cell
membrane may play a central role in the control of
cell surface plg activation.

when a  xxxg1766xxx -specific substrate was used in the
presence of  xxxg164xxx  , no change in t - p a activity
was observed. t o determine whether the effect of
ann- i on plasminogen activation was specific for t
p a , we compared  xxxg1766xxx  to urokinase ( u - p a ) , an ac
tivator that has a distinct glycoprotein receptor and
does not bind to ann- ii . in the presence of ann- i ,
p i . g activation by t - p a was significantly enhanced
( 8 . 3 - 4 - 1 . 2 ) as compare with control (1.6-+-0. 6) ( p

while  xxxg1767xxx -dependent p l g activation re
mained unchanged (1.4--t-0.7). these data demon
strated that the effect of ann- i on p i . g activation
applied specifically to t - p a , suggesting a requirement
for trimolecular assembly.

to evaluate the effect of  xxxg165xxx  on plasmin
generation, p l g was preincubated with recombinant
 xxxg164xxx  or h u v e c s and then exposed to  xxxg1766xxx .
in the presence of co-receptor, the activity of p l g
was increased by 6.08-fold for recombinant annexin
i and by 5 . 2 3 for h u v e c s expressing  xxxg164xxx 
as compared with that in the controls (1.3--1-0. 3).
compared with h u v e c s , recombinant  xxxg164xxx 
had no significant influence on the activation of plg.
this demonstrated that the conversion of h u v e c s
to native a n n - i was not involved in augmentation
of plasmin generation. these results indicated that
both soluble, n o n - m e m b r a n e - b o u n d ann-ii and

effect of receptor-related lysine residues on
activation of plg

discussion
endothelial cells are thought to play a key role in

23

intravascular plasmin generation in vivo. t h e y syn-.
thesize and secrete the two major forms of p i . g activator, tissue p i . g activator ( t - p a ) and urokinase,
and release the physiological inhibitor of these activators, p i . g activator inhibitor type-1 ( p a l ] ) e ~ ] in
addition, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial
cells bind both p i . g and t - p a in a concentration-dependent manner. these binding interactions preserve
catalytic efficiency and apparently protect plasmin
and t - p a from their inhibitors, thus potentially modulating hemostatic and thrombotic events at the blood
vessel surface.
endothelial cell membranes contain a major nonfibrin p l g and t - p a binding protein, which is oriented on the outer face of the membrane. this mr36000 protein specifically binds t - p a as well as plg.
t h e isolated t - p a / p l g binding site is resistant to reduction and preserves the capacity for plasmin generation ~s3. our studies provide support for the hypothesis that p i . g and t - p a can assemble on the endothelial cell surface in a manner that enhances cell surface
plasmin generation.
in the present study, recombinant annexin
had a profound effect on the efficiency of t - p a - d e pendent pi.g activation. this effect required lysinebindingsites of p l g , as it was abrogated in the presence of the lysine analog e- xxxd146xxx  acid or by
treatment of  xxxg165xxx  by  xxxg502xxx , indicating a carboxyl terminal lysine-dependent mechanism. t h u s , annexin [ is fibrin-like in its ability to
independently bind both t - p a and p l g , its enhancement of plasmin generation, and its specificity for tpa in contrast to  xxxg1767xxx . interestingly, the effect of
ann- ~ on enhancement of plasmin generation was
limited to  xxxg1766xxx -dependent p l g activation and was
not observed with  xxxg1767xxx . this observation supports
the hypothesis that co-assembly of p i . g and t - p a in
the presence of ann- k is necessary for enhancement
of plasmin generation [6'r?. f u r t h e r m o r e , catalytic activity of both t - p a and plasmin was fully preserved in
the presence of annexin k . this effect was specific
for t - p a , because urokinase-mediated p l g activation was not affected by annexin ~ .
t o the extent that annexin g enhances p l g activation upon binding of substrate and activator, its
effects may be considered to the fibrin like. annexin
belongs to a family of highly homologous, amphipathic, calcium- and phospholipid-hinding proteins c8"9]. t h a t no major structural difference exists
between free annexins and phospholipid-associated
annexins is suggested by comparison of the high resolution crystal structure of  xxxg166xxx  with low resolution electron diffraction images. t h u s , in the present
study, the catalysis-enhancing properties of phospholipid-free annexin ~ may mimic those of m e m b r a n e
associated annexin ~ . t o g e t h e r , these data suggest
that annexin ~ mediated co-assembly of t - p a and
p l g may promote plasmin generation at the blood
vessel surface.
