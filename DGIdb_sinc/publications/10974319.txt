abstract
we measured, using microdialysis, the effects of sibutramine, given intraperitoneally, on brain dopamine and serotonin flux into
striatal and hypothalamic dialysates of freely moving rats, and on the uptake of [3h]-da into striatal synaptosomes. for microdialysis
experiments, samples collected every 30 min were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, in a single run. administration
of a low dose of sibutramine (2.0 mg/kg, i.p) had no effect on dopamine or serotonin concentrations in striatal dialysates but higher
doses increased both: 5 mg/kg increased these concentrations to 196±24% (p⬍0.01) and 221±28% (p⬍0.01) of baseline, respectively; 10 mg/kg increased dopamine to 260±66% (p⬍0.01) and serotonin to 160±20% (p⬍0.05) of baseline. in hypothalamus, the
5 mg/kg sibutramine dose increased the dopamine concentration to 186±40% (p⬍0.05) and that of serotonin to 312±86% (p⬍0.01)
of baseline, while the 10 mg/kg (i.p.) dose increased dopamine to 392±115% (p⬍0.01), and serotonin to 329±104% (p⬍0.01) of
baseline. in vitro, sibutramine blocked [3h]-dopamine uptake into striatal synaptosomes, with an ic50 value of 3.8 µm.
these findings indicate that sibutramine has at least as great an effect on brain extracellular dopamine levels as on brain serotonin,
and suggest that the drug’s antiobesity action may result from the changes it produces in brain dopamine as well as serotonin
metabolism.  2000 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
sibutramine has been demonstrated to produce dosedependent weight reduction in obese patients (weintraub
et al., 1991; ryan et al., 1995; bray et al., 1996; lean,
1997) and is currently being used to treat this disorder.
it has been proposed that the drug’s clinical effects are
mediated by brain serotonin (5-ht) and noradrenaline
(na; lean, 1997), and inhibition of the uptake of these
transmitters might indeed be expected to reduce food
intake (samanin and garattini, 1993). in support of this
hypothesis, the decrease in food intake among rats given
sibutramine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was inhibited by the alpha
1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx , the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol, or the 5-ht receptor
antagonists metergoline, ritanserin and sb200646

(jackson et al., 1997a). moreover, sibutramine’s ability
to cause weight reduction in freely-feeding rats was
mimicked by the concurrent administration of fluoxetine
(a 5-ht uptake inhibitor) and nisoxetine (an na uptake
inhibitor), but neither drug was effective when given
alone (jackson et al., 1997b).
it has been proposed that sibutramine affects the
uptake of one brain catecholamine, na, but not that of
the other, dopamine (da) (luscombe et al., 1990). its
administration to rats (3 mg/kg) for 3 or 10 days
decreased the number of alpha-2 and beta-1 adrenoceptors in rat brain (heal et al. 1989, 1991; heal et al.,
1992a) but its administration for 1 or 14 days failed to
affect the numbers of dopaminergic d1 or d2 receptors
(cheetham et al., 1995; martin et al., 1995). (its effects
on the kinetic properties of various 5-ht receptors have
not been examined.) the efflux of [3h]-da from preloaded rat striatal slices was not altered by 10⫺7–10⫺5
m sibutramine. nor, in vivo, did the drug (3 or 6 mg/kg,
p.o.) alter levels of 3-methoxytyramine—a da metabolite which reflects da turnover and utilization—in rat

striatum. a higher sibutramine dose (6 mg/kg, p.o.) also
failed to induce circling behavior in rats with unilateral
nigrostriatal lesions (heal et al., 1990; heal et al.,
1992b), suggesting that it does not enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission. luscombe et al. (1990) examined the ability of plasma, taken from healthy male volunteers who had received 15 mg of sibutramine twice
daily, to inhibit the uptake of [3h]-na by rat cortical
synaptosomes, [3h]-5-ht by human platelets and [14c]da by rat striatal synaptosomes. na uptake was
inhibited by 60% and 5-ht by 40%, but da uptake
declined by only 20%. contrary results were obtained
by buckett et al. (1988), who used an in vitro preparation
to study sibutramine’s effect on na, da and 5-ht reuptake. they found that the ic50 for sibutramine’s inhibition of [14c]-na uptake was 2.17±0.38 µm while
those for [14c]-da and [14c]-5-ht uptake were 10.8±4.2
µm and 477±111 µm respectively. the differences
between the results obtained using in vitro and in vivo
preparations raise the possibility that sibutramine’s
metabolites might also have effects on these parameters.
we have investigated the effect of sibutramine on net
da and 5-ht flux from rat striatum and hypothalamus,
using in vivo microdialysis. we have also examined the
drug’s effect on da uptake into striatal synaptosomes,
and compared this effect with that of amphetamine, a
well-studied dopaminergic drug.

2. methods
2.1. animals
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 200–300 g were
purchased from taconic farms (germantown, ny,
usa), housed two per cage, kept on a 12:12-h light/dark
cycle, and given ad libitum access to food and water.
all animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the national institute of health guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals.
2.2. drug treatments
sibutramine was dissolved in saline and administered
intraperitoneally. all pharmacological treatments were
performed after stabilization of da and 5-ht levels in
perfusate, usually after about 2 h of perfusion. control
animals received only the saline vehicle i.p. for in vitro
experiments the concentrations of sibutramine and
amphetamine, dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(acsf), were expressed as final concentrations in the
reaction tubes. in control experiments tubes contained
only acsf.

2.3. brain microdialysis
dialysis probes of concentric design (tossman and
ungerstedt, 1986) were constructed from fused silica
capillary tubing (polymicro technologies, phoenix, az,
usa). tubing of 140 µm diameter was inserted within
wider silica capillary tubing (300 µm) and secured at the
inflow site using epoxy resin. a 2-mm or 4-mm length of
hollow microdialysis fiber (spectrum medical industries,
ca, usa) was sealed at its tip and secured between the
end of the wider silica capillary tubing and the inner
tubing, using a cyanoacrylate adhesive. as anticipated
from the literature and from prior studies in our laboratory, the probes exhibited in vitro recoveries of 11±2%
and 15±2% for da and 5-ht, respectively; data were
not corrected for probe recovery. probes were implanted
into the striatum (a, +0.7; l, 0.3; v, ⫺6.5; with respect
to bregma; paxinos and watson, 1986) or hypothalamus
(ap ⫺3.6; l, 1.8; v, 9.6; with respect to bregma) of
rats that had been anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine
(8.7/0.13%; 1 ml/kg, i.p.). animals were used 2 days
after surgery. the probes were perfused at a flow rate
of 1.7 µl/min, using a cma microperfusion pump
(carnegie medicin, acton, ma, usa), with acsf (in
millimolar): na+, 145; k +, 2.7; mg2+, 1.0; ca2+, 1.2,
adjusted to ph 7.4±0.2 with phosphate buffer, 2.0.
samples collected every 30 min were analyzed immediately by hplc with electrochemical detection. animals
were decapitated at the end of each experiment, and
probe locations were confirmed by visual examination
of the probe tracks.
2.4. hplc with electrochemical detection
dialysate samples were analyzed by reversed-phase
hplc, coupled with electrochemical detection. the
mobile phase was composed of 75 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate (nah2po4), 1 mm  xxxd3215xxx 
(sds), 0.1 mm ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid
(edta), 15% acetonitrile and 20% methanol; this was
adjusted to ph 5.7 with sodium hydroxide. this mobile
phase was delivered at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (lc10ad pump, shimadzu, columbia, md, usa) through
an hr-80 column (c18, 4.6×80 mm, 3 µm, esa,
bedford, ma, usa). da and 5-ht were detected using
a coulometric detector (coulochem ii, esa, bedford,
ma) coupled to a dual electrode analytical cell (model
5014). the potential of the first electrode was set at
⫺175 mv, and that of the second at +175 mv. under
these conditions, the sensitivities for da and 5-ht were
2 fmol/20 µl.
2.5. uptake of [3h]-da into striatal synaptosomes
crude synaptosomes were prepared from rat striatum
essentially as described by dodd et al. (1981). both stri-

atums, pooled together from five rats, were homogenized
in 10 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at
1000g at 0°c for 15 min to remove cell debris and
nuclei. the supernatant fluid was then layered onto 4 ml
of 1.2 m sucrose and centrifuged (130,000g) at 0°c for
15 min. the pellet contained mitochondria, while synaptosomes, myelin and some microsomes were retained at
the interface. the interface was diluted in 0.32 m
sucrose, layered onto 4 ml of 0.8 m sucrose, and centrifuged as above for 15 min. the resulting pellet contained
synaptosomes, while myelin was retained at the interface
and microsomes remained suspended mainly in the
upper phase. synaptosomes were then suspended in
acsf (ph=7.4) to give a final concentration of 4.5–5
mg/ml of protein (lowry et al., 1951), and stored on ice
for as short a time as possible prior to use in the [3h]da uptake assay. for monoamine uptake experiments,
 xxxd3426xxx  µl drug solution (sibutramine or amphetamine at
0.1–30 µm final concentration), 50 µl acsf, and 100
µl of fresh striatal synaptosomes were incubated at 37°c
in duplicate for each dose. after 5 min, 50 µl ice-cold
[3h]-da (final concentration 1×10⫺8 m) was added and
the samples maintained at 37°c for a further 5 min. the
reaction was terminated by addition of 4 ml ice-cold
saline, followed by rapid filtration over whatman glass
fibre filters (gf/f) under a vacuum. the tubes were
rinsed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold saline. these washings
were also filtered, and filters were then washed with 4
ml ice-cold saline. the filters were placed in scintillation
fluid (opti-fluor, 10 ml) and the accumulated radioactivity was allowed to solubilize and then assayed by
liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (beckman ls6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter) with a counting efficiency of about 50%. data were calculated as
percent inhibition of accumulation, using the formula:
% inhibition⫽

2.6. statistical analysis
for microdialysis experiments, mean baseline levels
were calculated as averages of the four consecutive 30min samples collected immediately before drug administration. in calculating and presenting the results, levels
(predrug baseline and postdrug samples) were expressed
as percentages of mean baseline value±s.e.m. effects
of various doses were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (anova). when significant effects were
found, post hoc analyses were carried out using dunnett’s test. for synaptosome experiments the concentration required to produce a 50% inhibition of [3h]-da
uptake (ic50) was determined by linear regression, following by log transformation of the concentrations.

2.7. reagents
the reagents used included amphetamine (sigma
chemical co. mo, usa), nah2po4, sds and edta
(fluka, buchs, switzerland), methanol and acetonitrile
(em science, cherry hill, nj, usa), opti fluor scintillation fluid (packard instrument company, meriden, ct,
usa), and [3h]-da (nen life science, boston, ma,
usa). other reagents used were of the highest grade
commercially available.

3. results
3.1. effect of a single dose of sibutramine on da and
5-ht concentrations in striatal dialysates
baseline da and 5-ht levels in striatal dialysates collected prior to drug administration were 140±16 and
8±0.6 fmol/50 µl (n=28), respectively. baseline levels of
the experimental groups, i.e. prior to drug administration, did not differ significantly from each other. a 2
mg/kg sibutramine dose did not affect dialysate da or
5-ht concentrations. higher doses (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.)
significantly increased both da and 5-ht concentrations
(fig. 1a,b). the maximum increases in da were to
196±24% (p⬍0.01) and 260±66% (p⬍0.01) of baseline,
after the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively; maximum
increases in 5-ht were to 221±28% (p⬍0.01) and
160±20% (p⬍0.05) of baseline. the increase in da concentrations reached statistical significance in 30–60 min
samples at 5 mg/kg, and in 0–30 min samples at the 10
mg/kg sibutramine dose. the increase in 5-ht concentrations reached statistical significance in 120–150 min
samples at the 5 mg/kg dose, and in 30–60 min samples
at the 10 mg/kg dose.
3.2. effect of a single dose of sibutramine on da and
5-ht concentrations in hypothalamic dialysates
baseline da and 5-ht levels in hypothalamic dialysates collected prior to drug administration were 15±2 and
9±0.4 fmol/50 µl (n=19), respectively. baseline levels of
the experimental groups, i.e. prior to drug administration, did not differ significantly from each other. the 5
and 10 mg/kg sibutramine doses both caused significant
increases in da and 5-ht concentrations (fig. 2a,b).
maximum increases in da were to 186±40% (p⬍0.05)
and 392±115% (p⬍0.01) of baseline, respectively;
maximum increases in 5-ht were to 312±86% (p⬍0.01)
and 329±104% (p⬍0.01) of baseline. the increase in
da concentrations reached statistical significance in 0–
30 min samples after both the 5 and 10 mg/kg sibutramine doses, and remained statistically significant for 3 h
after the 10 mg/kg dose. the increase in 5-ht concentrations reached statistical significance in 0–30 min

these data show that sibutramine enhances the net

in vivo, and that its efficacy in increasing extracellular

probably at least partially direct, inasmuch as sibutramine also blocks the uptake of [3h]-da into striatal synaptosomes. the striatal da and 5-ht terminals on which
sibutramine can act are probably on neurons originating
in the substantia nigra and dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively (graybiel and ragsdale, 1979; steinbusch et al.,
1980; van der kooy and hattori, 1980; van bockstaele
and pickel, 1993). the drug may also act indirectly
through axo-axonal da-5ht synapses, inasmuch as both
5-ht and da have been shown to increase each other’s
release in rat brain (benloucif et al., 1993; matsumoto
et al., 1995). less is known about the origins of the
hypothalamic da and 5-ht terminals on which the drug

may act, but it is generally accepted that the serotoninergic neurons project from the raphe nuclei while the
dopaminergic neurons are mostly intrinsic (sawyer and
clifton, 1980; lindvall et al., 1984; larsen et al., 1996).
sibutramine’s effect on da concentrations in brain
extracellular fluid, in vivo, has not been demonstrated
previously. the notion that the drug does not affect
dopaminergic neurons was based on in vitro observations, including its lack of effect  xxxd1891xxx ⫺7–10⫺5 m on
[3h]-da efflux from preloaded rat striatal slices, or on
3-methoxytyramine concentrations in striatal tissues at 3
and 6 mg/kg doses (heal et al., 1992b). however, in
those studies bupropion, a known da uptake inhibitor,

also failed to affect [3h]-da efflux or 3-methoxytyramine accumulation, indicating that the experimental systems used might not have been sufficiently sensitive.
under our experimental conditions, which measured
extracellular da levels in vivo, directly, sibutramine
clearly increased da in extracellular fluid (e.c.f.) from
striatum and hypothalamus by at least as much as it did
5-ht.
sibutramine’s effect on 5-ht concentrations in brain
e.c.f. has been documented previously using in vivo
microdialysis, and found to be weaker than that of other
5-ht uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine,
given at the same doses (prow et al., 1996; gundlah et
al., 1997). in vitro studies also demonstrated that sibutramine is a weaker 5-ht reuptake inhibitor than paroxetine, sertraline or fluoxetine. for example, sibutramine’s
ki values for inhibiting [3h]paroxetine binding and [3h]5-ht uptake were 2.1 and 3.1 µm, respectively, while
those of fluoxetine were 1.9 and 10.9 nm, respectively
(cheetham et al., 1993).
the increase in da caused by sibutramine persisted
for 3 h. this prolonged action could be mediated in part
by the drug’s primary and secondary amine metabolites,
inasmuch as these compounds are also known to inhibit
da uptake in vitro (luscombe et al., 1989). (we were
unable to investigate the metabolites’ effects on da levels in vivo because we were unable to obtain these
compounds.) thus, it is plausible that sibutramine’s
effect on food consumption might stem, in part, from its
action on dopaminergic neurotransmission. the present
experiments show that sibutramine increases synaptic
da levels and blocks uptake of [3h]-da into striatal

synaptosomes; they do not allow speculation as to
whether or not the drug also releases da.
apparently, no studies have been published investigating the dopaminergic component of sibutramine’s hypophagic effect. metoprolol, a selective beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, metergoline, a non-specific 5-ht
antagonist, ritanserin, a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist, and
sb2000646, a 5-ht2b/2c antagonist all partially antagonized sibutramine’s hypophagia, while  xxxd3000xxx , an alpha
1 adrenoceptor antagonist, fully blocked this effect
(jackson et al., 1997a). the complete inhibition by prozosin is surprising because beta 1 adrenoceptors and 5ht2a/2c receptors, which are not thought to be inhibited
by this drug, are also partially responsible for the hypophagia. one possible explanation might be that alpha 1
adrenoceptor receptors may be downstream to the 5-ht
and beta adrenoceptors. in addition, the doses of adrenergic (0.3–10 mg/kg, i.p.) and serotoninergic (0.1–40
mg/kg, i.p.) antagonists used were chosen based on their
not having an effect on food consumption when given
alone. their in vitro affinities for their respective receptors are in the range 10⫺7–10⫺9 m (leysen et al. 1981,
1985; hoyer, 1988; kenneth et al., 1994). however, no
data are available concerning their brain concentrations
after systemic administration to rats. it is conceivable
that these drugs attain high enough concentrations to
affect da receptors, inasmuch as ritanserine and metergoline do have weak affinities for these receptors. sibutramine might also attain sufficiently high brain concentrations, after systemic administration of hypophagic
doses, to influence dopaminergic as well as serotoninergic and adrenergic neurons.

a. balcioglu, r.j. wurtman / neuropharmacology 39 (2000) 2352–2359

in conclusion, sibutramine increases da as well as 5ht concentrations in rat brain e.c.f. this effect on da
neurotransmission might also be responsible for the
drug’s hypophagic effect.
