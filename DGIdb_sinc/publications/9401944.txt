abstract
the functional affinities of the al-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd1809xxx , currently being used to reverse
diagnostic pupillary dilation, were determined at subtype a in rat vas deferens, at subtype b in guinea-pig
spleen and at subtype d in rat aorta and compared with various al-adrenoceptor subtype-discriminating
antagonists.
 xxxd1809xxx  had relatively high affinity both at rat vas deferens ala-adrenoceptors (paz = 7.93) and at rat
aortic ald-adrenoceptors (paz = 8.26), whereas its affinity at guinea-pig splenic alb-adrenoceptors
(pa2 = 7.13) was lower. the reference antagonists, 5-methylurapidil and the 5-methylurapidil/flesinoxan
hybrid, b8805-033 ( ( k ) - 1,3,5-trimethyl-6[[3[4(2(2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxymethyl)
- 1 , 4 -benzodioxin - 5 -yl)-1piperazinyl]propyl]-amino]2,4(lh,3h)- xxxd3470xxx ), were 40- and 1500-fold selective for the a subtype,
whereas spiperone and bmy 7378 (8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl] ethyl] - 8-azaspiro[4.5]decane7,9-dione dihc1) were confirmed as selective for the b and d subtypes of al-adrenoceptors, respectively.
thus, in functional experiments  xxxd1809xxx  seems to be moderately selective (approximately 10-fold) for
the a and d over the b subtype of al-adrenoceptors; the possible therapeutic consequence of this is discussed.

al-adrenoceptors comprise a heterogeneous family (minneman & esbenshade 1994). molecular biological techniques
have provided evidence for the existence of at least three genes
encoding ala-, alb- and crld-adrenoceptors (with lowercase
letters) that are expressed in distinct parts of the brain and body
(for recent reviews, see bylund et a1 1994; hieble et a1 1995)
and that correspond to the pharmacologically defined native
ala-, aib- and ald-adrenoceptors (with uppercase letters)
(morrow & creese 1986; han et a1 1987; cotecchia et a1 1988;
lomasney et a1 1991; schwinn et a1 1991; forray et a1 1994).
each of these subtypes has been observed to have a distinct
expression pattern in various tissues in man (weinberg et a1
faure et a1 1995).
 xxxd1809xxx  (34 2-[4-(2-methylphenyl)-l -piperazinyl]ethyl ] 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazolo-[4,3-a]pyridine
hcl; fig. l),
currently being used as eye-drops to reverse the diagnostic
mydriasis produced by the al-adrenergic agent, phenylephrine,
or the antimuscarinic drug,  xxxd3450xxx , is thought to initiate
this effect by al-adrenoceptor blockade (doughty & lyle
1992). functional and binding studies have demonstrated that
 xxxd1809xxx , in the concentration range lo-* to low7 m,
inhibits noradrenaline-evoked contraction of rat vas deferens
(lisciani et al 1982) and binds to al-adrenoceptors in rabbit iris
(valeri et al 1986) and various brain regions of the rat (valeri
et al 1988), however, studies exploring its affinity for the
subtypes a, b and d of al-adrenoceptors are lacking. this
might be of particular importance, because the hypothesis had
been advanced (alessandri et a1 1992) of a heterogeneous
population of at least two different al-adrenoceptors located in
the iris dilator muscle in man, one being activated by endogenous noradrenaline and the other by phenylephrine, and
which differ in their sensitivity to ca2+ entry blockade.
although characterization of these subtypes and their functions
still awaits elucidation, recent in-vitro data suggest that the
relevant al-adrenoceptor mediating phenylephrine-induced

contraction of the iris dilator muscle in man has similarity to
the subtype l (ishikawa et a1 1996), which is distinct from the
commonly known subtypes a, b and d (muramatsu et a1
1990a). therefore, the ability of agents such as  xxxd1809xxx  to
initiate the reversal of mydriasis by blockade of al-adrenoceptors raises the question of their possible selectivity for
existing al-adrenoceptor subtypes.
the aim of this study was to determine the functional affinity of  xxxd1809xxx  at different al-adrenoceptors by using rat
vas deferens for subtype a (han et a1 1987; eltze & boer
1992; ford et a1 1994), spleen from guinea-pig for subtype b
(eltze 1994) and rat thoracic aorta for subtype d (kenny et al
1995; testa et a1 1995; eltze 1996). antagonists which are
selective for the a subtype of al-adrenoceptor, rather than the
b and d subtypes, namely 5-methylurapidil (gross et a1 1988)
and its newly developed flesinoxa hybrid, b8805-033 (eltze et
a1 1996), as well as spiperone (michel et a1 1989) and bmy
7378 (goetz et a1 1995) known to be selective for alb- and
ald-adrenoceptors, respectively, were used for comparison.
affinities of the reference antagonists at al-adrenoceptor subtypes in these tissues have previously been published (eltze &
boer 1992; eltze 1994, 1996; eltze et a1 1996).

for calculation of antagonist affinities (pa2 values) were performed as described in detail elsewhere (eltze & boer 1992).

(30 min equilibration) of test drug for determination of
antagonist affinity (paz value) at alb-adrenoceptors were
performed as previously described (eltze 1994).

noradrenaline by more than 25% (not shown) were not used
for the regression analysis. this possibly resulted from ca2+
entry blockade and a non-specific smooth muscle depressant
activity described for  xxxd1809xxx  (lograno et a1 1987). in
particular, cazf-channel blockers preferentially inhibit noradrenaline-evoked contraction of rat vas deferens after aiaadrenoceptor stimulation (han et a1 1987; eltze & boer 1992).
the paz value obtained from the constrained three-point
schild plot was 7.93 (paz=7.91 at a slope= 1.02, not significantly different from 1.oo, p > 0.05; fig. 3). affinities for
the reference antagonists 5-methylurapidil,  xxxd3000xxx , b8805033, spiperone and bmy 7378, previously determined in this

at least four agonist concentration-response curves were
recorded until contraction of the tissues was reproducible. the
antagonist-induced shifts were related to the final control curve
and determined for each individual preparation. schild plots
were constructed to estimate the paz value and the slope fi of
the regression line from each experimental series, which generally comprised at least four different antagonist concentrations (arunlakshana & schild 1959). the paz values quoted in
table 1 were calculated from schild plots in which the slopes
of the regression lines were constrained to 1.00. when the
slope of the schild plot differed significantly (p < 0.05) from
unity, pa2 values determined from constrained regression lines
(fi = 1.oo) should be regarded as approximations.

discussion
al-adrenoceptor blockade appears to be the predominant feature of  xxxd1809xxx , marketed as eye-drops for reversing the
diagnostic mydriasis induced by phenylephrine,  xxxd3450xxx  or
their combination (lisciani et a1 1982; valeri et a1 1986, 1988;
doughty & lyle 1992); however, nothing is known about the
mechanism of its interaction with the subtypes a, b and d of
al-adrenoceptors. by using functional in-vitro methods, the
reference antagonists, 5-methylurapidil and b8805-033, were
confirmed as selective for ala-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens as opposed to alb-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig spleen and
crld-adrenoceptors in rat aorta (aia> alb= ald), whereas
 xxxd3000xxx  behaved unselectively in these tissues (ala=
alb= crid). bmy 7378 had approximately 30-fold greater
affinity for aid- than for either ala- or alb-adrenoceptors
(giid> ala = alb). in contrast with spiperone, which shows
slight selectivity for alb-adrenoceptors over both ala-and aldadrenoceptors (alb> a l a= aid),  xxxd1809xxx  shows approximately 10-fold greater affinity for the a or d than for the b
subtype of al-adrenoceptors (a1a = ald > aib).
pupil diameter is an opposing dynamic function of the
noradrenergic innervation of the ins dilator muscle producing
mydriasis and cholinergic innervation of the iris sphincter
muscle producing miosis (turner 1975; van alphen 1976;
yoshitomi et al 1985). little is known about the possible
existence of al-adrenoceptor subtypes on the iris dilator
muscle in man and the mechanisms and response characteristics whereby al-adrenoceptor stimulation and blockade result

results.

in pupil dilation and contraction, respectively. initially the
hypothesis of at least two different al-adrenoceptors located in
this tissue had been advanced by using  xxxd2728xxx , which
attenuated mydriasis evoked by conjunctival instillation of
tyramine but not that of phenylephrine (alessandri et a1 1992).
because az-adrenoceptors, which are generally sensitive to
ca2+ entry blockade (van meel et a1 1981), are not detectable
on the iris dilator muscle in man (fanciullacci et a1 1988) the
possibility of their involvement in the mydriatic effect elicited
by tyramine can be excluded; it is most likely that it is based
on stimulation of ala-rather than of aib-or aid-adrenoceptors,
whereas the  xxxd2728xxx -resistant mydriatic effect after phenylephrine is more consistent with the characteristics of
responses generally observed after aib- and ald-adrenoceptor
stimulation (han et a1 1987; minneman 1988; schwinn et a1
1991). if this is true, it could be speculated that ala-adrenoceptors reside in the synaptic region of neuromuscular junction
within the iris dilator muscle where they are primarily activated by neuronal noradrenaline release, whereas aib- or aldadrenoceptors, or both, are located in perisynaptic regions
where they can be stimulated pharmacologically by exogenous
al-adrenoceptor agonists or physiologically by plasma catecholamines, the presence of which has been demonstrated in
the vascular system of the rat (vargas et a1 1994; zhou &
vargas 1996).

most recently, the al-adrenoceptor in isolated human iris
dilator muscle activated by phenylephrine and blocked by
exceptionally high concentrations of  xxxd3000xxx  (pa, = 7.3;
ishikawa et al 1996), has been suggested as belonging to a new
subtype, designated all (muramatsu et a1 1990a). however,
the higher affinity of  xxxd2914xxx  (pa2=7.5) than of 5methylurapidil (pa2 = 6.6) in the iris in man (ishikawa et a1
1996) is also consistent with the affinity difference observed at
cloned and expressed alb-adrenoceptors (average pki = 7.4
compared with 6.9; values taken from eltze 1996), as they
have been shown to exist in iris dilator muscle of the rat (hill
et a1 1993) and the rabbit (takayanagi et a1 1992). presently,
the observed characteristics of the differentially initiated and
blockable responses in the iris of man in-vivo (alessandri et a1
1992) and in-vitro (ishikawa et a1 1996) are difficult to interpret, but it has been tentatively suggested that ala-adrenoceptors mediate neuronally induced mydriasis; no conclusion
can be made about other al-adrenoceptor subtypes (l or b, or
both) involved in mydriasis evoked by exogenous agonists
until more data for al-adrenoceptor subtype-discriminating
antagonists, which should differentially block each mydriatic
response, are available. preliminary experiments on rabbit
aorta, which is considered to be endowed with all-adrenoceptors (muramatsu et a1 1990b), showed  xxxd1809xxx  to have
relatively low affinity (pa2 = 7.04; eltze, unpublished) comparable with that determined at aib-adrenoceptors in guineapig spleen (pa2= 7.13).
whether the resulting functional receptor selectivity profile
observed for  xxxd1809xxx  (ala = ald> a i b= gil) has any
therapeutic consequence in respect of preferential blockade of
one or several al-adrenoceptor subtype(s) specifically involved
in mydriasis (a, and l or b, or both) is unclear. however, by
considering the applied dose of  xxxd1809xxx  generally needed
for reversing mydriasis (1 to 4 drops of a 0.5% solution, i.e. a
concentration of 1.5 x
m; doughty & lyle 1992) and the
relatively narrow concentration range which blocks all existing
al-adrenoceptor subtypes (approximately a factor of lo), this
seems rather unlikely.
