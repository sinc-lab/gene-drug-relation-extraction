abstract
several receptors which bind the hormone amy (amylin) with high afﬁnity have now been identiﬁed. the
minimum binding unit is composed of the ct (calcitonin) receptor at its core, plus a ramp (receptor activity
modifying protein). the receptors have been named  xxxg157xxx (a) , amy2(a) and  xxxg159xxx (a) in accordance with the
association of the ct receptor (ct(a) ) with  xxxg1926xxx ,  xxxg1927xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  respectively. the challenge is now
to determine the localization and pharmacological nature of each of these receptors. recent attempts to
achieve these aims will be brieﬂy discussed.

amy (amylin)
amy, a 37-amino-acid peptide hormone, shares amino acid
and structural similarity with ct (calcitonin), cgrp (ct
gene-related peptide) and  xxxg80xxx . hence, these
peptides are grouped together as the ct peptide family [1].
a common pair of cysteine residues in each peptide contributes an n-terminal ring structure that is the key factor
in determining the biological activity. truncation of the
sequence encoding this region renders each peptide an antagonist. amy, a product of the pancreatic islet, has a range
of effects that relate to nutritional status, inhibiting food
intake, gastric emptying and post-prandial glucagon secretion
as well as opposing the metabolic actions of insulin in skeletal
muscles [2].

the molecular nature of amy receptors
to our knowledge, there is no report describing the identification of a single molecular entity that encodes an amy
receptor. attempts to identify amy receptors from tissues
or cells that responded to this peptide were problematic due
to consistent identification of ct receptors (for which amy
has low affinity) [3]. with hind-sight, such information is
extremely informative given that it is now clear that highaffinity amy-binding sites are formed by ct receptors
[4]. the circumstance under which this occurs is extremely
unusual. unlike most g-protein-coupled receptors, the ct
receptor can be modified in such a way that its natural
affinity for amy is increased by several orders of magnitude.
the proteins that mediate this effect are known as ramps
(receptor activity modifying proteins), a family of three
single-transmembrane spanning proteins [5]. ramps and

their receptor partners (of which relatively few have been
identified) appear to associate in the endoplasmic reticulum,
and are co-trafficked to the cell surface where they form
stable complexes that act as receptors for such peptides as
amy, cgrp and  xxxg80xxx  [5]. for a discussion of
how ramps and their receptors interact, see conner et al.
(this issue). in addition to a shift in amy affinity, the binding
profile of other peptides is also altered when the ct receptor
is associated with different ramps [4]. thus ramps act as
pharmacological switches, modulating the responses of cells
to extracellular stimuli.
there are minimally six types of human amy receptor
that can be reconstituted in recombinant expression systems
[1]. these arise from interactions between the three ramps,
the ct receptor and its major splice variant (table 1). if
other splice variants of the ct receptor in various species are
also considered, the potential receptor diversity and specificity in its actions that amy could elicit are quite considerable [6]. although not strictly considered as amy receptors,
cl–ramp complexes (where cl stands for ct receptor-like receptor) are also capable of binding high concentrations of amy and could be pharmacologically, if not
physiologically, relevant [1]. thus with appropriate pharmacological characterization, it is probable that all aspects of
amy behaviour can be accommodated by the receptors in
this scheme.

amy receptor pharmacology
the binding properties of the six main receptors have been
characterized in some detail. a general pattern has emerged
whereby  xxxg157xxx  receptors have high affinity for salmon ct,
amy and cgrp and lower affinity for mammalian cts [1].
for amy2 and  xxxg159xxx  , a similar pattern is principally
observed although the affinity for cgrp is lower. interestingly, the precise receptor phenotype is dependent on
cell type and ct receptor splice variant, particularly for
 xxxg1927xxx -generated amy receptors [7]. whereas in hek-293

table 1 nomenclature of amy receptors, resulting from
association of ramps with ct receptors
on the basis of nomenclature described in [1]. ct(a) was formerly
known as ctri1− or ctr2 and ct(b) as ctri1+ or  xxxg321xxx . the nomenclature
described is for human receptors, the rat ct receptor isoforms can also
be considered in this scheme, e.g. rat ct(a) (formerly ctr1a or c1a).

cells, ct(a) is capable of producing  xxxg80xxx -sensitive
receptors with each ramp, in cos-7 cells, there is essentially no binding or response to this peptide [4,8]. such
variations between studies will probably reflect inherent variability in endogenous ramp, receptor and g-protein
complement.
the profile of peptide interaction at  xxxg157xxx  receptors has
been found to be similar to that for endogenous amy receptors in mouse alpha-tsh cells and nucleus accumbens, where
high affinity for cgrp in addition to amy is a feature [3,9].
cross-reactivity of cgrp and amy at each other’s binding
sites is substantial and some biological effects of amy may be
inhibited by the cgrp receptor antagonist cgrp8-37 [10].
indeed, this resulted in early speculation that amy mediated
its biological actions through cgrp receptors. as amy is
only a weak agonist of cloned  xxxg320xxx  receptors, the results
are supportive of the existence of a separate subset of receptors that interact closely with amy and cgrp. this is
probably the  xxxg157xxx  receptor, with the effects of amy not
mimicked by cgrp mediated by amy2 or  xxxg159xxx  receptors.
the relative affinities of antagonists at each of the
cloned amy receptors have not been resolved. nevertheless,
salmon (s) ct8-32 was capable of inhibiting amy responses
at  xxxg157xxx (a) , whereas an equal concentration of cgrp8-37
was ineffective [11]. the relative insensitivity of these receptors to cgrp8-37 has led to speculation that this may
be the molecular entity responsible for the putative
‘cgrp2 ’ receptor [12]. indeed, cgrp8-37 may be useful in
distinguishing the effects of cgrp mediated through  xxxg320xxx 
(cl/ xxxg1926xxx ) and  xxxg157xxx  receptors. on the other hand, it is
unlikely that there is sufficient separation between the effects
of sct8-32 or ac187 (a sct8-32 analogue) to distinguish
between ct and the subtypes of amy receptor although
this has yet to be tested empirically. the effectiveness of
amy8-37 , an antagonist of amy receptors in tissues, has not
been reported.

signal transduction and receptor
regulation
unsurprisingly, given the relatively recent identification of
the molecular nature of amy receptors, there is very little
specific literature on the signal transduction, desensitization

or other regulation of cloned amy receptors. however, as
the main signalling unit is probably the ct receptor, many
of the properties of this receptor could be extrapolated to
amy receptors. therefore those amy receptors formed
from ct(a) would be expected to signal through gs and
camp (as they do) and gq . on the other hand, those receptors formed from ct(b) might be expected to have reduced
signalling capacity and reduced internalization [6]. for cl/
ramp heterodimers, the associated ramp subtype does
not appear to affect appreciably the regulation of cl in
terms of internalization and recycling but there has been no
investigation of this type for amy receptors [13].

co-localization of amy receptor
components
ramps are abundant with the mrna of at least
one ramp present in almost every tissue or cell line [5].
ct receptors are similarly abundant [6]. a cursory examination of the literature, attempting straightforward overlap
of tissue mrna expression or binding is unlikely to be
sufficiently informative, although it is clear that ct receptors
are expressed wherever amy binding is present [3]. a
detailed study at the cellular level is required to ascertain the
correlation between individual ramps, ct receptor splice
variant and amy phenotype. at present, this information is
lacking although there has been some recent progress in this
regard. in situ hybridization was used to map the localization
of ct(a) , ct(b) and each ramp in the rat area prostrema and
subfornical organ, areas where circulating amy is thought to
modulate eating and drinking behaviours. mrna for either
one or both ct receptors was observed, along with ramps
in regions where amy also stimulated c-fos gene expression
[14]. although there was insufficient resolution to confirm
that the ramp and receptor mrnas were expressed in the
same cells, it is a step forward that function and each receptor
component were examined in the same study. cgrp is also
able to excite subfornical organ neurons [15], consistent with
at least an  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor phenotype in these cells.

conclusion
cloning of ramps has enabled understanding of the
molecular basis of amy receptors. the diversity arising
from multiple ramps, multiple ctr isoforms and the
contribution of other cellular factors provides much distinct
and subtle pharmacology, the full impact of which remains to
be elucidated.
