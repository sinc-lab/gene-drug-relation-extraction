major depression is associated with the upregulation of a2a-adrenoceptors in brain tissue and blood platelets. the homologous
regulation of these receptors by g-protein-coupled receptor kinases (grks) might play a relevant role in the pathogenesis and treatment
of depression. this study was designed to assess the status of the complex a2a-adrenoceptor/gai/grk 2 in the platelets of depressed
patients (n ¼ 22) before and after treatment with the antidepressant mirtazapine, an antagonist at a2a-adrenoceptors (30–45 mg/day for
up to 6 months). a second series of depressed suicide attempters (n ¼ 32) were also investigated to further assess the status of platelet
grk 2 and grk 6. platelet a2a-adrenoceptors and gai protein immunoreactivities were increased in depressed patients (49 and 35%)
compared with matched controls. in contrast, grk 2 content was decreased in the two series of depressed patients (27 and 28%). grk
6 (a grk with different properties) was found unchanged. in drug-free depressed patients, the severity of depression (behavioral ratings
with two different instruments) correlated inversely with the content of platelet grk 2 (r ¼ 0.46, n ¼ 22, p ¼ 0.032, and r ¼ 0.55,
n ¼ 22, p ¼ 0.009). after 4–24 weeks of treatment, mirtazapine induced downregulation of platelet a2a-adrenoceptors (up to 34%) and
gai proteins (up to 28%), and the upregulation of grk 2 (up to 30%). the results indicate that major depression is associated with
reduced platelet grk 2, suggesting that a defect of this kinase may contribute to the observed upregulation of a2a-adrenoceptors.
moreover, treatment with mirtazapine reversed this abnormality and induced downregulation of a2a-adrenoceptor/gai complex. the
results support a role of supersensitive a2a-adrenoceptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of major depression.

introduction
the noradrenergic hypothesis of depression postulates a
reduced function of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine at
various adrenoceptors in specific brain regions (ressler and
nemeroff, 1999). recent functional and biochemical
approaches further indicate that major depression is
associated with noradrenergic dysfunction and upregulation of inhibitory a2a/c-adrenoceptors in the brain (callado
et al, 1998; garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999; fu et al, 2001;
gonzález-maeso et al, 2002; ordway et al, 2003). chronic

npp10200303297/default.pdf

psychosocial stress in monkeys (a model of depression) has
also been shown to induce persistent increases of a2aadrenoceptors in the brain (flügge et al, 2003). moreover,
depressed patients also display upregulation and supersensitive a2a-adrenoceptors in blood platelets (garcı́asevilla et al, 1981, 1986, 1987, 1990; piletz et al, 1991;
gurguis et al, 1999). these observations suggest that
patients with mood disorders might have an underlying
disturbance of noradrenergic system, perhaps due to
hyperactive a2-adrenoceptor function (fu et al, 2001).
the regulation of a2a-adrenoceptors is also an important
issue in major depression because most antidepressant
drugs have indirect regulatory effects on these receptors
(charney, 1998; esteban et al, 1999). the homologous
regulation of receptors is induced by a family of g-proteincoupled receptor kinases (named grk 1–7), some of which
translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (eg
grk 2 but not grk 6) to phosphorylate the agonist
(endogenous ligand)-activated receptors (pitcher et al,

mirtazapine and regulation of a2a-adrenoceptors
ja garcı́a-sevilla et al

581

1998). this process eventually results in receptor desensitization and downregulation and/or a change in receptor
signaling (lefkowitz, 1998). since the a2a-adrenoceptor is
regulated by grk 2/3 (eason et al, 1995), a heuristic
hypothesis in major depression is that a defect in grk 2/3
function could lead to receptor supersensitivity, which in
turn could predispose to illness. alternatively, increased
grk 2/3 activity might help to compensate for excessive
stimulation of a2a-adrenoceptors. few studies have dealt
with the involvement of brain grks in major depression
and in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs
(garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999; miralles et al, 2002; grangemidroit et al, 2003). in the prefrontal cortex of drug-free
depressed suicides, the content of grk 2/3, but not of grk
6, was found increased in parallel with those of a2aadrenoceptors and gai coupling proteins, which was
interpreted as a compensation of the abnormal higher
functioning of the a2a-adrenoceptor/gai complex in depression (garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999; grange-midroit et al, 2003).
changes in receptor function in blood platelets have often
been used as an indirect marker of neurotransmitter
receptor alterations in psychiatric disorders (stahl, 1985;
camacho and dimsdale, 2000). moreover, recent findings
indicate that the platelets can synthesize proteins in
response to external stimuli and that these cells contain
messenger rna for a wide diversity of proteins (lindemann
et al, 2001), which allows the investigation of posttranscriptional receptor regulatory mechanisms. therefore,
this study was designed to assess the biological status of the
complex a2a-adrenoceptor/gai/grk in the platelets of
patients with major depression. the aim was also to
determine whether treatment with the antidepressant
mirtazapine (holm and markham, 1999; millan et al,
2000), an antagonist at a2a-adrenoceptors that enhances
the release of norepinephrine and serotonin, results in the
modulation (eg reversal of baseline abnormalities) of
platelet a2a-adrenoceptors and associated regulatory proteins in depressed patients.

subjects and methods
patient selection and treatment
a first series of depressed patients (n ¼ 22) were examined
and treated (mirtazapine) in the affective disorders unit of
the sant pau hospital, autonomous university of barcelona
(adu patients), and a second series of depressed suicide
attempters (n ¼ 32) were examined in the emergency
psychiatric unit, department of psychiatry, university of
geneva (epu patients). the study protocols were approved
by the respective institutional review boards.
in the adu series, 22 consecutive eligible outpatients 18
years or older were recruited, examined, and treated by
three research psychiatrists (vp, dp, and ea), with high
inter-rated reliability and good internal consistency (alvarez et al, 1997). each patient was rated by the same clinician
along the study. the inclusion criteria were: (1) a diagnosis
of major depressive disorder according to dsm-iv criteria
(apa, 1994), single episode (diagnostic code 296.2, 14
patients), or recurrent episodes (diagnostic code 296.3,
eight patients); (2) absence of any active antidepressant
treatment during a minimum of 2 months before admission;

and (3) provision of informed consent after complete
description of the study. all selected depressed patients (20
women, two men, mean age 7 sd: 42 7 3 years) were free
of other psychiatric disorders (except personality disorder,
n ¼ 2, which was assessed by medical history and clinician’s
judgment) or severe organic pathology, and were permitted
their regular habits but were warned not to use psychotropic drugs, except for moderate doses of prescribed
benzodiazepines. the baseline clinical ratings (the 17-item
hamilton rating scale for depression, hrsd, and the
montgomery-åsberg rating scale for depression, marsd)
and blood sampling were performed on the same day and
before the onset of mirtazapine treatment. the mean global
score on the hrsd was 19 7 2 (range, 18–24, n ¼ 22) and
on the marsd was 26 7 4 (range, 20–33, n ¼ 22). the mean
duration of the depressive episode was 3.1 7 0.8 months.
whenever possible, depressed patients were studied again
after treatment with mirtazapine (30–45 mg/day for an
initial period of 6 months). clinical ratings and biochemical
assays were repeated 1 (n ¼ 22), 4 (n ¼ 21), 12 (n ¼ 16), 24
(n ¼ 12), and 28 (n ¼ 12) weeks after the onset of treatment.
plasma concentrations of mirtazapine were monitored by a
hplc/ultraviolet detection method at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks,
and were found in the therapeutic range (dodd et al, 2000).
at week 24, mirtazapine was substituted by placebo during
4 weeks (study end point: 28 weeks) to assess the clinical
and biochemical effects of drug withdrawal. safety was
evaluated by the assessment of treatment-emergent adverse
events, routine clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs.
therapeutic response was defined as a 50% reduction in the
baseline hrsd, and clinical remission as a reduction of the
score to 9 or below. in all, 12 depressed patients completed
the 6-month treatment phase, and showed a good
therapeutic response and remission of the depressive
episode. mirtazapine withdrawal (4 weeks) did not induce
reappearance of depressive symptoms. four patients did
not respond to mirtazapine treatment and were excluded
from the study (from week 4 to 12), two patients were
withdrawn for excessive drug side effects (anxiety, weightgain), and four patients abandoned the study for personal
reasons. in all, 15 normal volunteers who were matched
with one or two of the selected patients for sex and as
closely as possible for age ( 7 4 years) were also studied.
the healthy controls (13 women, two men, mean age:
43 7 14 years) were recruited among hospital employees
and written informed consent was also obtained. control
subjects were interviewed by a research psychiatrist to
exclude those with a history of psychiatric disorders,
medical illness, or drug or alcohol abuse. control subjects
were drug free for a minimum of 2 weeks before the assays,
and only one blood sample was obtained.
in the epu series, 32 consecutive eligible hospitalized
suicide attempters 18 years or older were recruited and
examined by two research psychiatrists (gr and aa). the
inclusion criteria were: (1) an immediate suicide attempt,
defined as a self-destructive act carried out with at least
some intent to end one’s life, which required hospitalization
for medical treatment of the sequelae of the attempt; (2) a
dsm-iv diagnosis of major depressive disorder (single
episode, 31 patients; recurrent episodes, one patient); (3)
absence of antidepressant treatment during a minimum of 2
weeks before admission; and (4) provision of informed

consent after description of the study. all selected depressed
suicide attempters (27 women, five men, mean age 7 sd:
34 7 10 years) were free of other psychiatric disorders
(except personality disorder, n ¼ 19, which was assessed by
medical history and clinician’s judgment) or severe organic
pathology. the methods of suicide attempts were drug
overdose (n ¼ 28 with positive urine toxicology, including
antidepressant drugs, n ¼ 7, and benzodiazepines plus
ethanol, n ¼ 18) and venesection (n ¼ 4). suicidal ideation
and the actual risk of suicidal behavior (rsb) at the time of
hospital admission was assessed with an adaptation of the
suicidal thinking and behavior questionnaire (chiles et al,
1989), where the scale scores from 0 (low risk, 0–2) to 5
(high risk, 3–5). the mean global score for rsb was
2.8 7 1.6 (range, 0–5, n ¼ 32). the mean global score on the
hrsd was 25 7 5 (range, 13–34, n ¼ 32). a total of 17
normal volunteers who were matched with one or two of the
selected patients for sex and as closely as possible for age
( 7 5 years) were also studied. the healthy controls (14
women, three men, mean age: 34 7 10 years) were recruited
among hospital employees and screened as above.

platelet samples and membrane preparation
venous blood (35 ml) was obtained by venipuncture
(fasting subjects, 0830–1000) and the platelets were
immediately isolated by centrifugation on a specific cell
separation medium as described previously (garcı́a-sevilla
et al, 1997) the pellets of the platelets were stored at 801c
until assays. crude platelet membranes (and protein
content) were prepared for the immunodetection of the
target proteins as reported in detail previously (garcı́asevilla et al, 1997, 1999)

immunoblot assays and quantitation of target protein
contents
the relative densities of platelet a2a-adrenoceptors and
associated regulatory proteins were assessed by quantitative
immunoblotting by using specific polyclonal antibodies and
in-gel standard curves as described previously (garcı́asevilla et al, 1997). in brief, solubilized target membrane
proteins were separated by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6  8-cm minigels, 15 wells,
mini 2-d cell, bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca, usa),
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (western blotting),

labeled with the specific primary antibody (overnight at
41c), and subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing the secondary
antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit
igg antiserum (1 : 5000 dilution). the following primary
antibody were used: anti-a2a-adrenoceptor, 1 : 500 dilution
(produced and characterized in this laboratory (ozaita et al,
1999; garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999); anti-gai1/2, 1 : 7000
dilution (as/7, du pont-nen research products, boston,
ma, usa), anti-grk 2, 1 : 5000 dilution (c-15, santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa), anti-grk 6, 1 : 1000
dilution (c-20, santa cruz biotechnology), and anti-pp-2a
catalytic subunit, 1 : 20 000 dilution (clone 46, transduction
laboratories, lexington, ky, usa). bound antibody (immunoreactivity) was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection system (amersham
international, little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk) and
visualized by the exposure to autoradiographic film
(amersham ecl hyperfilm) for 1–15 min (autoradiograms). the autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometric scanning (gs-700 imaging densitometer, resolution:
42 mm, bio-rad laboratories) by measuring the integrated
optical density (iod) of the immunoreactive bands. in
previous studies, the antibodies used had been tested and
characterized in human platelets and/or human and rat
brain tissue, and labeled bands with molecular masses of
70 kda (mature a2a-adrenoceptor), 40 kda (gai2 subunit),
80 kda (grk 2), 66 kda (grk 6), and 36 kda (pp-2a)
(garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1997, 1999; ozaita et al, 1999; grangemidroit et al, 2002, 2003).
the procedure for the quantitation of target proteins in
human platelet and brain membranes by immunoblotting
has been described in detail previously (garcı́a-sevilla et al,
1997; grange-midroit et al, 2003). briefly, two platelet
samples of different protein content, in duplicate or
triplicate, from one or two depressed patient (eg drug free
and after mirtazapine treatment) were evaluated using
standard curves (ie total protein loaded vs iods), which
consisted of five points of different protein content
(resulting in a linear relationship) of a control subject
matched for sex and age, all loaded on the same gel (see
figure 1 for quantitation of grk 2). given a known amount
of protein from a problem sample loaded in the gel well (pr,
the real amount), the percentage change with respect to
control samples was calculated as the ratio between the
amount of protein corresponding to the iod value of the

subject (15–60 mg protein), was used to quantitate the content of grk 2 (25 and 50 mg protein in triplicates) in the depressed patient (mean value for grk
2: 46% of matched control). the molecular mass of grk 2 (80 kda) was determined by calibrating the blot with prestained molecular weight markers as
shown on the left-hand side.

all series of data were analyzed with the program graphpad

distributions (kolmogorov–smirnov normality test). results are expressed as mean values 7 sd (text) or sem
(figures). the one-sample t-test (identical in its implementation to the paired t-test), direct paired t-test, or analysis of
variance (anova) with repeated measures was used for the
statistical evaluations. in the 12 patients who completed the
treatment, anova with repeated measures (before, during,
and after mirtazapine) allowed an assessment of drug effects
(basal vs protein change in immunoreactivity) and time
(changes with the duration of treatment). significant
interactions revealed by anova were further examined
with bonferroni’s multiple comparison test to determine
when significant effects occurred and the magnitude of the
changes. changes in behavioral rating (score on the hrsd)
were assessed by the w2 test. pearson’s correlation
coefficients were calculated to test for possible association
among variables (eg relation between platelet grk 2 and
behavioral rating). the level of significance was chosen at
pp0.05. all tests were two-tailed.

note that in the depressed patient the basal immunodensities (p vs c) of

did not alter the immunodensities of the target proteins.

9 and 3%). the changes in immunoreactive proteins were
significant both in patients with a single depressive episode
(n ¼ 14) and in those with the recurrent type of depression
(n ¼ 8) (data not shown). moreover, protein changes were
similar in depressed patients with low suicidal ideation
(n ¼ 16) and in those with moderate suicidal behavior
(n ¼ 6) (item 3 of the hrsd) (data not shown).
for the 22 patients, the severity of depression on the
hrsd (total score) correlated inversely with the immunodensity of platelet grk 2 (r ¼ 0.46, n ¼ 22, f ¼ 5.28,
p ¼ 0.032) (figure 4). a similar negative correlation between
clinical behavioral ratings and platelet grk 2 was also
obtained when the severity of depression (total score) was
measured with the montgomery–åsberg rating instrument
(r ¼ 0.55, n ¼ 22, f ¼ 5.70 p ¼ 0.009) (not shown). in
contrast, no statistically significant correlation was observed between the density of a2a-adrenoceptors (r ¼ 0.08,
n ¼ 22, p40.05) or gai2 proteins (r ¼ 0.11, n ¼ 22,
p40.05) and the severity of depression (hrsd). platelet

(r ¼ 0.38, n ¼ 22, p ¼ 0.08) or grk 2 (r ¼ 0.22, n ¼ 22,

multiple regression analysis between grk 2 enzyme
(dependent variable) and a2a-adrenoceptors and gai2

the unexpected observed decrease in the content of platelet
grk 2 in major depression. in this group of depressed
suicide attempters, the immunodensity of platelet grk 2
was also found decreased (mean 7 sd: 28 7 37%, n ¼ 32,
t ¼ 4.37, p ¼ 0.0001) when compared with that of age- and
sex-matched controls (figure 5). two patients exhibited a
very high (176%) or a very low (13%) density of platelet
grk 2 corresponding to 2.8 sd above and 1.6 sd below the
mean of the depressed group (figure 5). after removal of
these two patients, the decrease of platelet grk 2 was
similar: 30 7 31% (n ¼ 30, t ¼ 5.33, po0.0001). however, no
experimental factors were identified that would justify
excluding these observations (the patients were tested twice
with similar results using different matched controls). the
decrease of platelet grk 2 in depressed suicide attempters
was more pronounced in women (30 7 36%, n ¼ 27,
t ¼ 4.39, p ¼ 0.0002) than in men (18 7 43%, n ¼ 5,
t ¼ 0.91, p ¼ 0.41), although no significant difference was
found between sexes (t ¼ 0.70, df ¼ 30, p ¼ 0.49). moreover,
the decreases of platelet grk 2 were similar in high-risk
(32 7 37%, n ¼ 18, t ¼ 3.72, p ¼ 0.002) and in low-risk
(23 7 37%, n ¼ 14, t ¼ 2.34, p ¼ 0.036) suicide attempters.
the downregulation of platelet grk 2 was also similar in
depressed suicide attempters with (35 7 31%, n ¼ 19,
t ¼ 4.94, po0.0001) or without (25 7 40%, n ¼ 13, t ¼ 2.24,
p ¼ 0.04) a concomitant diagnosis of personality disorder
(t ¼ 0.77, df ¼ 30, p ¼ 0.45). for the 32 patients, the severity
of depression on the hrsd (total score) also correlated
inversely, but weakly, with the immunodensity of platelet
grk 2 (r ¼ 0.27, n ¼ 32, p ¼ 0.13) (not shown). suicidal
ideation (score on the rsb) did not correlate with platelet
grk 2 (r ¼ 0.08, n ¼ 32, p ¼ 0.65).
in depressed suicide attempters, the immunodensity of
platelet grk 6 (a receptor kinase that belongs to a different
subgroup of the grk family) was not significantly different
from that in age- and sex-matched controls (7 7 24%
decrease, n ¼ 32, t ¼ 1.68, p ¼ 0.10) (figure 5). similarly, the

abundance of phosphatase type pp-2a in the platelets did
not differ from that in the controls (7 7 28% decrease,
n ¼ 29, t ¼ 1.37, p ¼ 0.18). in these patients, however, there
were positive and significant correlations between the
contents of grks and pp-2a in the same platelet samples
(for grk 2: r ¼ 0.45, n ¼ 29, f ¼ 6.72, p ¼ 0.015; for grk 6:
r ¼ 0.38, n ¼ 29, f ¼ 4.57, p ¼ 0.042). in depressed suicide
attempters, clinical behavioral ratings (hrsd and rsb) did
not correlate significantly with platelet grk 6.

a2a-adrenoceptors and associated regulatory proteins
during and after mirtazapine treatment
treatment of depressed patients with mirtazapine (30–
45 mg/day for 1–24 weeks) induced a time-dependent
regulation of the initially abnormal immunodensities
of target proteins in the platelets toward basal values
(figures 2 and 3). thus, mirtazapine treatment for 4 and 24
weeks was associated with the downregulation of a2aadrenoceptors (percentage change 7 sd: 29 7 41%,
n ¼ 21, t ¼ 3.22, po0.005, and 34 7 42%, n ¼ 12,
t ¼ 2.74, po0.02 by paired t-test) and gai2 proteins
(20 7 23%, n ¼ 21, t ¼ 4.25, po0.001, and 28 7 24%,
n ¼ 12, t ¼ 3.92, po0.005), and with the upregulation of
grk 2 (27 7 27%, n ¼ 21, t ¼ 4.17, po0.001, and 30 7 24%,
n ¼ 12, t ¼ 4.01, po0.005) (figure 2). during the treatment
(1–24 weeks), the plasma concentrations of mirtazapine
were found in the therapeutic range (22.4 7 7.2–
35.7 7 13.6 ng/ml). in most patients, mirtazapine treatment
was also associated with good clinical response
(hrsd 7 sd, basal: 19 7 2%, n ¼ 22; 4-week treatment:
11 7 4%, n ¼ 21, po0.001; 24-week treatment: 6 7 6%,
n ¼ 12, po0.05). substitution of mirtazapine by placebo (4
weeks) in remitted patients with major depression (n ¼ 12)
was not associated with the reappearance of depressive

the results of the first part of the study indicate the
existence of an increased density of the a2a-adrenoceptor/
gai protein complex in blood platelets of drug-free
depressed patients, which is in agreement with previous
reports in postmortem brains (callado et al, 1998; garcı́asevilla et al, 1999; ordway et al, 2003) and platelets (garcı́asevilla et al, 1981, 1986, 1987, 1990; piletz et al, 1991;
gurguis et al, 1999) from depressed subjects. therefore,
these results further support the existence of supersensitive
a2a-adrenoceptors in major depression (fu et al, 2001;
gonzález-maeso et al, 2002; see also flügge et al, 2003).
unexpectedly and in marked contrast to previous observations in the brains of drug-free depressed suicides (garcı́asevilla et al, 1999; grange-midroit et al, 2003), the content
of platelet grk 2 was found reduced in drug-free depressed
patients. in fact, the combined results of the two series of
patients investigated (adu and epu) clearly indicate that
the abundance of platelet grk 2 is decreased (28 7 34%,
n ¼ 54, po0.0001) in major depression. the similar results
obtained in the adu (drug-free patients; at least 2 months)
and epu (suicide attempters mainly by drug overdose)
series of depressed patients indicate that possible acute
drug effects (epu series, for example, cyclic antidepressant
drugs) were not involved in the decrease of grk 2 (see
miralles et al, 2002). moreover, the reduced platelet grk 2
was not related to suicidal behavior, but it showed a clear
tendency to correlate inversely with the severity of
depression (total score on the hrsd or marsd). in this
context, grk 6 (a grk with different properties) and
protein phosphatase pp-2a (involved in receptor resensitization) (pitcher et al, 1998) were found unchanged in the
platelets of depressed patients (current results) and in the
brains of depressed suicides (grange-midroit et al, 2003),
suggesting some specificity for grk 2 in major depression.
recent functional genomic approaches (ie changes in
gene expression after methamphetamine treatment in rats
using oligonucleotide genechip microarrays) have identified several novel candidate genes that may be involved in
mood disorders or schizophrenia (niculescu et al, 2000).
interestingly, one of these induced genes coded for grk 3
and the immunodensity of this kinase (a close homolog of
grk 2) was shown to be decreased in lymphocytes from a
small group of subjects (n ¼ 4) with bipolar disorder
(niculescu et al, 2000). in this context, the observed
reduction in the content of platelet grk 2 in depressed
patients could suggest that a defect in the transcriptional
regulation of grk 2 may contribute to the upregulation of
a2-adrenoceptors and/or to the pathogenesis of major
depression (ie inability of grk to desensitize the receptor
and hence a greater inhibitory response of norepinephrine).
as mentioned, however, an increased expression of grk 2/3
was observed in the prefrontal cortex of drug-free depressed
suicides (garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999; grange-midroit et al,
2003), and most probably this is an adaptive mechanism to
neuropsychopharmacology

585

compensate the abnormal higher functioning of some
receptors in the brain (eg homologous regulation of the
a2-adrenoceptor/gai complex) (garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999).
in the current study, the decrease of platelet grk 2 in
depressed patients was more pronounced in women than in
men, suggesting that hormonal factors could also play a
role. thus, treatment of female rats with estradiol reduced
protein content, enzyme activity, and messenger rna of
grk 2 in the hypothalamus (ansonoff and etgen, 2001). on
the other hand, the platelet aggregation (induced by
epinephrine) and reactivity are increased in depressed
patients (garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1986, 1990; musselman et al,
1996, 2000), and activated platelets produce reactive oxygen
species, such as  xxxd2298xxx  (maresca et al, 1992)
that can modulate the expression of grks. thus, the
exposure of lymphocytes to  xxxd2298xxx  resulted in
marked decreases in grk 2 expression and in agonistinduced desensitization of b2-adrenoceptors (lombardi
et al, 2002). this latter mechanism could also explain the
observed decrease of grk 2 and upregulation of a2aadrenoceptors in the platelets of depressed patients. clearly,
further studies are still needed to clarify the molecular
mechanisms of the reduced platelet grk 2 in major
depression.
the results of the second part of the study indicate that
the treatment of depressed patients with mirtazapine (1–24
weeks) was associated with good clinical response and with
a time-dependent downregulation of the complex a2aadrenoceptor/gai proteins and with the upregulation of
grk 2 in the platelets. the antidepressant mirtazapine
(holm and markham, 1999; delgado et al, 2002) is a potent
a2a-adrenoceptor antagonist that enhances the release of
norepinephrine (acting at a2a-autoreceptors) and serotonin
(acting at a2-heteroreceptors) in nerve terminals (millan
et al, 2000; haddjeri et al, 1997). therefore, the observed
clinical efficacy and downregulation of a2a-adrenoceptors
induced by  xxxd2651xxx  also support a relevant role of
supersensitive a2a-adrenoceptors in the pathogenesis of
major depression (fu et al, 2001; gonzález-maeso et al,
2002). chronic antidepressant treatments have been repeatedly shown to induce downregulation and desensitization of
a2-adrenoceptors and/or gai proteins in the platelets of
depressed patients (garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1986, 1987, 1990,
1997; piletz et al, 1991; gurguis et al, 1999), and in the rat
(smith et al, 1981; barturen and garcı́a-sevilla, 1992;
kovachich et al, 1993; mongeau et al, 1994; esteban et al,
1999; mateo et al, 2001) and human (de paermentier et al,
1997; garcı́a-sevilla et al, 1999) brains. similar to other
antidepressant drugs, mirtazapine could also induce the
downregulation of platelet a2-adrenoceptors, indirectly,
through the rise in plasma norepinephrine induced by the
drug. in healthy subjects and in depressed patients, the
a2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan
have been shown to increase the plasma concentrations of
norepinephrine (osman et al, 1989; andrews et al, 1999)
and of its main neuronal metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol
(andrews et al, 1999), indicating significant blockade at
presynaptic a2a/c-adrenoceptors in peripheral adrenergic
nerves. concomitantly, yohimbine reduced the orthostatic
(upright posture) increase in the platelet aggregation
response induced by the increased norepinephrine, also
indicating blockade of a2a-adrenoceptors in the platelets
neuropsychopharmacology

(andrews et al, 1999). similar results should be expected
after the systemic administration of mirtazapine, a more
selective and potent a2a-adrenoceptor antagonist (millan
et al, 2000).
mirtazapine treatment in depressed patients (1–24 weeks)
was also associated with a rapid and sustained upregulation
of platelet grk 2, which closely paralleled the downregulation of a2a-adrenoceptors, suggesting that the expression of these proteins are regulated in a concert manner
by the antidepressant. thus, mirtazapine treatment would
reverse, through direct or indirect mechanisms (see above),
the basal deficit of platelet grk 2 to finally allow the
homologous regulation of the a2a-adrenoceptor. however,
during receptor desensitization and downregulation, grks
are in turn subjected to complex regulatory mechanisms (eg
increased activity of grk 2 by its phosphorylation by other
kinases) (kohout and lefkowitz, 2003), which also could be
involved in the observed upregulation of grk 2 induced by
mirtazapine. future studies should clarify whether other
antidepressant drugs (eg cyclic antidepressants) are also
able to reverse, and by which mechanism, the reduced
expression of grk 2 in the platelets of depressed patients.
in conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that
major depression is associated with increased a2a-adrenoceptor/gai complex and decreased receptor kinase grk 2 in
blood platelets. this suggests that a defect in the regulation
of platelet grk 2 may contribute to the upregulation of
a2a-adrenoceptors. in drug-free depressed patients, the
severity of depression correlated inversely with the expression of platelet grk 2. treatment with the a2-adrenoceptor
antagonist mirtazapine was associated with good clinical
response and downregulation of a2a-adrenoceptor/gai
complex and upregulation of grk 2 in the platelets.
together, the results support a role of supersensitive
a2a-adrenoceptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of
major depression.
