abstract
in the last few years, our knowledge of genetically determined causes of short stature has greatly increased by reports of challenging patients, who offered the opportunity
to study genes that play a role in growth. since the first paper
that showed the etiology of laron syndrome [godowski pj,
et al: proc natl acad sci usa 1989;86:8083–8087], many mutations in the  xxxd3223xxx  (gh) receptor have been
identified. recently, new mutations or deletions have been
found in several components of the gh–insulin-like growth
factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ) axis: a homozygous mutation of the gh1 gene,
resulting in a bio-inactive gh; mutations in the  xxxg2216xxx  gene,
which plays a major role in the gh signal transduction; a ho-

review, we describe the clinical and biochemical features of
these genetic defects. genetic analysis has become essential

introduction

body growth is regulated by many genes, of which
only a few have been clarified. however, in the last years
our knowledge of genetically determined causes of short
stature has greatly increased and genetic analysis is becoming essential in the diagnosis of short stature.
a review article in this journal in 2003 described the
most important genetically determined causes of short
stature and the genes involved [2]. only 2 years later im-

portant papers were published presenting new diseases,
caused by genetic defects in the  xxxd3223xxx  (gh)–
insulin-like growth factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ) axis. in this review,
we will give an overview of the clinical aspects and the
biochemical parameters for these genetic defects in the
gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis and we present a flow chart for the diagnostic approach of these disorders.
we will focus on those children, whose height is more
than 2.5 sds below the mean of the population reference.
the first discriminating step in the diagnostic process of
short stature is the presence or absence of dysmorphic
features or disproportionate stature. hereditary causes of
short stature in combination with dysmorphic or disproportionate features were reviewed by kant et al. [2]. in
summary, in case of dysmorphic features a chromosomal
abnormality (numeric, structural, mosaic or uniparental
disomy) is suspected and karyotyping is indicated. dysmorphic features may be minor, as seen in patients with
silver-russell syndrome, who have in 10% of the cases
uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. one can consider
to look for noonan syndrome, prader willi syndrome of
22q11 deletion in patients with short stature and subtle
dysmorphic features.
disproportionate short stature is the result of skeletal
dysplasia, a category of disorders affecting in most cases
the epiphysis, metaphysis or diaphysis of the long bones,
with specific radiological characteristics. the genetic basis of these disorders is emerging, as many skeletal dysplasia gene loci have been identified. more than half of all
patients with skeletal dysplasias have a mutation at
 xxxg485xxx  or  xxxg793xxx . mutations in the shox gene are
even more frequent, but do not always present with skeletal abnormalities. 2–3% of the children with idiopathic
short stature have a shox deletion or mutation [3]. it is
particularly worthwhile to look for a shox deletion or
mutation because treating these children with gh results
in a similar catch-up growth as seen in girls with turner
syndrome treated with gh. recently, deletions in the
pseudoautosomal region downstream the shox gene
were identified in patients with leri weill dyschondrosteosis [4]. phenotypically these patients were indistinguishable from patients with shox deletion.
the child with proportionate short stature should be
screened for organic, systemic and endocrine disorders.
in children born small for gestation age (sga) and a
small head circumference chromosome disorders, congenital infections or exposure to toxins should be considered. after excluding organic and systemic diseases  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3 measurements serve to focus on disturbances in the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis. as further diagnostic
222

horm res 2006;66:221–230

procedures heavily depend on  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3 concentrations, we would like to stress the importance of a
reliable  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3 assay.

gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis

the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis plays a key role in regulating somatic growth. genetic defects in one of the components
(pituitary gh secretion,  xxxg890xxx  (ghr), post-receptor signaling and  xxxg1144xxx ) of this axis usually result in proportionate growth retardation. in the last years, several
patients with new genetic defects in the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis
have been identified. we will summarize the genetic, biochemical and clinical aspects of these new findings (table 1).
pituitary gh secretion
classical gh deficiency can be the result of a mutation
in the gh releasing  xxxg1603xxx  (ghrh-r) gene
[5], a genetic defect in one of the genes playing a role in
the ontogenesis of the gh producing cells in the anterior
pituitary (pou1f1, prop1, hesx1, lhx3, lhx4, etc.)
[6] or a mutation or deletion of the gh1 gene [6]. dysfunctional gh variants, caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the gh1 gene, have been described by
takahashi et al. [7]. recently, the first homozygous missense mutation in the gh1 gene (gh-c53s) has been described [8]. this mutation leads to the absence of the disulfide bridge cys-53 to cys-165, resulting in reduced
ghr binding and signaling. these genetic defects are
comparatively rare causes of short stature.
recent studies demonstrate high diversity in the proximal promoter region of the gh1 gene, resulting in some
haplotypes that are associated with a reduced level of gene
expression, while other haplotypes were associated with
increased expression [9]. one can speculate that a haplotype, associated with reduced expression of gh, results
in a condition with low spontaneous gh secretion and
thus low levels of  xxxg1144xxx , while stimulated gh secretion
may be normal.
growth  xxxg1603xxx  and gh signaling
the biological effects of gh can only be reached in the
presence of a normal functioning ghr, and an intact
post-receptor signaling pathway. deletions and mutations in the extracellular domain of the ghr gene result
in classical gh insensitivity (laron syndrome). more recently, mutations in the transmembrane and intracellular
domain of the receptor were identified, resulting in gh

insensitivity syndrome with normal or high levels of gh
binding protein [10–12].
the first report of a specific molecular defect in the
gh signal transduction was published by kofoed et al.
[13]. the authors described a patient with a homozygous
missense mutation in the highly conserved sh2 domain
of the  xxxg2216xxx  gene, which is essential for the gh signaling cascade and  xxxg1144xxx  transcription. at the moment of
writing this review, several patients with homozygous
mutations in the  xxxg2216xxx  gene have been described: a
frame shift mutation [14, 15], a nonsense mutation [16],
another frameshift mutation [17], and a splice site mutation [18]. all patients appear to show hyperprolactinemia;
some of them have a serious immunodeficiency, while
others show no such clinical symptoms.

recently, a heterozygous mutation of the ib gene was
described [19, 20]. ib is part of the nfb signaling
pathway, playing a major role in immune responses. besides severe immune deficiency, this patient also had
signs of partial gh insensitivity, suggesting that the
nfb pathway could play a role in the gh signal transduction.

genetic disorders in the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis

horm res 2006;66:221–230

 xxxg1144xxx 
one of the biological effects of gh is stimulating  xxxg1144xxx  production, which is mainly taking place in the liver, but
also in all other cells of the body.  xxxg1144xxx  has endocrine,
paracrine and autocrine functions.  xxxg1144xxx  secretion is under control of many other factors than gh (e.g. nutrition).  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1146xxx  and insulin are the most important
223

regulators of prenatal growth. postnatally,  xxxg1144xxx  remains
important, while the role of  xxxg1146xxx  is still unclear. in
1996, one patient with a homozygous deletion of exons 4
and 5 of the  xxxg1144xxx  gene was described. phenotypically
he showed intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal
growth failure, microcephaly, mental retardation, sensorineural deafness and multiple dysmorphic features [21].
in 2003, a patient with intrauterine growth retardation,
short stature, delayed psychomotor development and
sensorineural deafness was described, with a homozygous mutation, changing the normal amino acid sequence
of the e domain of the  xxxg1144xxx  precursor, resulting in low
circulating levels of  xxxg1144xxx  [22]. in 2005, we described the
first patient with a homozygous missense mutation of the
 xxxg1144xxx  gene [23]. the phenotype of this 55-year-old patient was similar to that of the patient with an  xxxg1144xxx  deletion [21]. family members with a heterozygous  xxxg1144xxx  mutation were shorter and had lower head circumferences
than family members without the mutation. recently, a
boy was presented with a partial  xxxg1144xxx  deficiency due to
a homozygous missense mutation of the  xxxg1144xxx  gene, resulting in pre- and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, mild developmental delay and normal hearing
tests [24].
in the circulation  xxxg1144xxx  is bound to binding proteins
(igf-binding proteins, igfbp’s). these proteins exhibit
specific characteristics in relation to delivery of  xxxg1144xxx  to
different tissues. igfbp-3 production is strongly dependent on gh. igfbp-3 forms with  xxxg1144xxx  and acid-labile
subunit (als) a ternary complex in the circulation. a homozygous deletion of the als gene, resulting in a ‘circulating  xxxg1144xxx  deficiency’, was described in 2004 [25]. this
patient was not very short, but had a very delayed puberty. later, a boy with a similar phenotype was reported
[26].
 xxxg1144xxx  receptors ( xxxg1145xxx ) are widely spread through the
body. children with a deletion of the distal long-arm of
chromosome 15, which includes the  xxxg1145xxx  gene, are
short [27]. it was assumed that specific mutations/deletions of the  xxxg1145xxx  gene could result in growth retardation.
the first report on mutations in the  xxxg1145xxx  gene was
published in 2003 by abuzzahab et al. [28]: a compound
heterozygous mutation of the  xxxg1145xxx  gene, resulting in
reduced  xxxg1144xxx  binding and decreased receptor phosphorylation and a nonsense mutation in exon 2, resulting in
reduced expression of  xxxg1145xxx . recently, a heterozygous
mutation in the cleavage site of the proreceptor of  xxxg1145xxx 
was reported in a 6-year-old japanese girl and her mother [29]. we described a mother and daughter with a het224

horm res 2006;66:221–230

erozygous missense mutation in the intracellular part of
the  xxxg1145xxx  [30]. a 13.6-year-old girl was presented with a
heterozygous missense mutation in the highly conserved
n-terminal fibronectin type iii domain of the  xxxg1145xxx 
[31]. recently, a new heterozygous missense mutation at
the  subunit of the  xxxg1145xxx  was described in a 4year-old girl with short stature (–3.6 sds) and her mother [32].

proposal for a diagnostic flow chart for patients
with severe short stature of unknown origin

although we acknowledge that undoubtedly future
studies will show additional cases of the genetic defects
described above, as well as new genetic disorders, we think
that developing a diagnostic algorithm might be helpful
in the evaluation of severely short children. for this purpose, we developed some flowcharts, based on the recently described patients, in combination with theoretical
considerations. the flowcharts can be used as guidelines
in the diagnostic process of patients with idiopathic short
stature. as our knowledge of genetic causes of short stature is increasing rapidly, these diagrams undoubtedly will
be subject of adaptation in the coming years.
as main inclusion criterium for considering genetic
evaluation, we choose a height sds of !–2.5, assuming
that more pathology is found with a lower height sds. we
believe that deviation of growth is not a valuable parameter, as in some of the earlier described cases growth is far
below, but parallel to, the –2.5 sds line. similarly, target
height cannot be used as criterium, because in some cases parents are short due to the same genetic defect (as in
the cases of heterozygous  xxxg1145xxx  mutations).
figure 1 shows the first diagnostic step in a child with
a height !–2.5 sds. proportions should be measured and
in case of disproportionate short stature a skeletal survey
is performed and the child is referred to a clinical geneticist. radiological abnormalities can point to a known
skeletal dysplasia, requiring specific molecular analysis.
if no or minimal radiological abnormalities are found,
the shox and  xxxg793xxx  gene can be analyzed, as in some
cases mild disproportionate short stature is the only clinical feature [33, 34].
karyotyping should be carried out when dysmorphic
features are found, but also in the absence of dysmorphic
features karyotyping is usually carried out in all girls
with unexplained short stature. recently, it was argued
that also in boys with short stature karyotyping should
be considered, in order to diagnose a xy/x chromosomwalenkamp/wit

al pattern [35]. in the dysmorphic child with a normal
karyogram a genetic defect of the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis is still
possible: e.g. the patient with a deletion of the  xxxg1144xxx  gene
[21] and the patients with  xxxg1145xxx  gene mutation showed
dysmorphic features [28]. obviously, if another cause for
short stature is found by basic diagnostic screening, genetic analysis of the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis is not indicated.
the next criterium in a child with proportionate short
stature is the presence or absence of being sga, defined as
a birth weight or length of !–2 sds. in case of sga, further
investigations will be focused on genetic defects of  xxxg1144xxx 
production or sensitivity. indeed, children with classical
gh deficiency or insensitivity are usually not born sga.
in case of sga, one should look for mutations or deletions
in the  xxxg1144xxx  or  xxxg1145xxx  gene or a  xxxg1144xxx  signal transduction
defect. in children with a normal birth weight and length
additional testing should be focused on disturbances in
gh secretion, gh sensitivity or gh signaling.
in children with short stature, born sga, measuring
the head circumference is essential.  xxxg1144xxx  plays a key role
in intrauterine growth and cerebral development and pre-

natally  xxxg1144xxx  secretion is gh independent. therefore, in
sga children with a small head circumference primary
 xxxg1144xxx  deficiency or insensitivity should be considered
(fig. 2). the  xxxg1144xxx  level will determine the differential diagnosis. undetectable  xxxg1144xxx  levels will indicate a homozygous  xxxg1144xxx  deletion or nonsense mutation with absolutely no production of  xxxg1144xxx . theoretically, one can expect very low  xxxg1144xxx  levels in cases of a homozygous
missense mutation in the  xxxg1144xxx  gene resulting in an abnormal  xxxg1144xxx  protein that can only be partially detected
by the assay.  xxxg1144xxx  levels between –2 and 0 sds could be
the result of heterozygous mutations or deletions of  xxxg1144xxx .
it is conceivable that in the future polymorphisms in the
promoter region of the  xxxg1144xxx  gene will be found that may
explain the short stature in some of these cases. in case of
a heterozygous mutation of  xxxg1145xxx  plasma  xxxg1144xxx  is usually elevated, but it can be low if the child is malnourished
by extremely poor appetite [30]. in spite of these theoretical possibilities, at present, we do not advise further genetic analysis, at least with the current tools available, in
patients with  xxxg1144xxx  levels in the lower normal range. the

differential diagnosis in patients with normal or high
 xxxg1144xxx  levels consists of a homozygous  xxxg1144xxx  missense mutation, resulting in an abnormal  xxxg1144xxx  molecule, or a heterozygous  xxxg1145xxx  mutation with decreased or absent binding of  xxxg1144xxx  to the mutated receptor. in all these conditions, igfbp-3 levels are within the normal range.
with a normal head circumference these genetic defects are less probable, but they cannot be completely
ruled out. heterozygous mutations or deletions of the
 xxxg1144xxx  or  xxxg1145xxx  gene could present with short stature,
sga and a head circumference 1 –2 sds. one may consider to perform in vitro experiments with fibroblasts of
patients, that meet these criteria. depending on the sensitivity of the fibroblasts to  xxxg1144xxx , the  xxxg1144xxx  gene or the
 xxxg1145xxx  gene can be sequenced.
we will now discuss the group of patients with short
stature and a normal birth weight and length. the first
diagnostic step in these patients is to determine the igf226

horm res 2006;66:221–230

i and igfbp-3 levels. if the  xxxg1144xxx  level is below the normal
range (!–2 sds) the interpretation of the gh peak in a
stimulation test determines the next step (fig. 3). an mri
of the pituitary-hypothalamus region should be performed to demonstrate or exclude anatomical defects.
gh deficiency is usually diagnosed if the gh peak is
below 20 mu/l (equivalent to 6.6, 7.7 or 10 g/l, depending on the standard used) in two tests. depending on the
presence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies analysis
of transcription factors as hesx-1, prop-1, and pit 1 is
required. in special cases analysis of lhx3 or lhx4 can
be considered. in case of isolated gh deficiency, we advise to analyze the gh and ghrh-r gene, but one can
argue that these tests could be restricted to those children
in whom a positive family history for short stature or extremely short stature is found.
a gh peak within the lower normal range (20–
30 mu/l) can be the result of a disturbance in the gh sewalenkamp/wit

cretion and one can consider to analyze the gh promoter gene. in several countries, including the netherlands,
the combination of very low  xxxg1144xxx  and borderline gh
peaks after stimulation, is sufficient indication for gh
therapy. a low 12- or 24-hour profile, which has been
termed ‘neurosecretory dysfunction’ by several investigators, could be used as criterium for analysis of the gh
promoter gene.
a normal gh peak (30–40 mu/l) in combination with
low  xxxg1144xxx  levels in patients with clinical features of gh
deficiency and retarded skeletal maturation can be present. in these cases a low 12- or 24-hour gh profile could
reflect a relatively inactive gh promoter haplotype. one
should note, however, that in some cases with a gh signaling disorder very low  xxxg1144xxx  levels in the presence of
normal gh peaks have been found.

1 60 mu/l) consists of: bio-inactive gh, a ghr defect, a
gh signal transduction defect ( xxxg2216xxx  mutation) or an
als deficiency (fig. 4). the response of  xxxg1144xxx  to increasing doses of gh (the  xxxg1144xxx  generation test, described in
table 2) will roughly distinguish the conditions characterized by an abnormal gh molecule from gh insensitivity states. we are aware that many different protocols
for the  xxxg1144xxx  generation test have been described, and
that the diagnostic value of all of them is still uncertain.
theoretically, in patients with a bio-inactive gh,  xxxg1144xxx 
will reach normal levels with the lowest gh dose, while
in patients with a ghr or post-receptor problem  xxxg1144xxx 
will not increase or only on the highest gh dose.

insensitivity can result in low  xxxg1144xxx  levels with a normal
gh peak in the stimulation test (40–60 mu/l). at his moment, however, we do not propose genetic analysis in
these patients, as we think the time and money investment will not be balanced by the results.

conclusion

in patients with short stature a systematic diagnostic
approach may reveal the cause of the growth disorder.
the medical history, including birth weight, length and
head circumference, and physical examination, including body proportions, are necessary for the first differential diagnosis. biochemical evaluation will point to a
more specific diagnosis, which can be confirmed with
molecular techniques. in this review, we discussed new
genetic defects in the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis and proposed a
practical flow chart for the diagnostic work-up.
the proposed diagnostic pathways will lead to maximum results when pediatric endocrinologists, adult endocrinologists, clinical geneticists and molecular biologists cooperate. an unusual presentation of a patient with
a growth disorder should alert the clinician to look for
new abnormalities in the gh– xxxg1144xxx  axis or other genes
involved in growth.
