tacrine protection of acetylcholinesterase from inactivation by  xxxd2393xxx : a circular dichroism study.  tacrine ( xxxd3270xxx ) showed an apparent noncompetitive inhibition of torpedo acetylcholinesterase (ache) with a dissociation constant, ki, of 8.5 nm. it altered the cd bands of ache in the near-uv region, which monitor the local conformation of aromatic side groups, but not those in the far-uv region, which measure the secondary structure. an extrinsic cd band was induced at 348 nm, with a molar ellipticity of 35,000 deg cm2 dmol-1 (bases on tacrine), when each ache subunit (mr = 67,000) was saturated with one tacrine (mol/mol). with this band as a probe, the bound tacrine could be displaced by  xxxd1968xxx  or  xxxd1820xxx , both of which are known to bind to the anionic site at the active center of ache, but not by  xxxd3027xxx , which binds to the peripheral site of the enzyme. tacrine protected ache from inactivation by  xxxd2393xxx  (dfp). ache completely lost its enzymatic activity when 1 mol of dfp was bound per mol of subunit upon incubation of 7 microm ache (subunit) with 100 microm dfp for 40 min, but tacrine-treated ache retained 60% of its activity and bound only 0.2 mol of dfp per mol of subunit under similar conditions. the corresponding cd, at 348 nm, of the ache-tacrine-dfp complex increased or decreased gradually, depending on the order of addition of tacrine and dfp, and reached an equilibrium value (80% of its original) after 2 days. the difference absorption spectrum of the ache-tacrine-dfp complex was the same as that of the ache-tacrine complex. these results suggest that the protective effect of tacrine may be due to steric hindrance at the esteratic site of the enzyme.
