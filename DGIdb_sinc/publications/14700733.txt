abstract
although studies have suggested that dopamine can be transported by serotonin transporters (serts), such activity has not been
characterized at the cloned serts. dopamine and serotonin uptake by human sert expressed in hek-293 cells was compared at 37 and 40
8c. elevated temperature was found to alter serotonin transport, but had no significant effect on dopamine transport. these effects led to a 10fold increase in the serotonin:dopamine transport ratio reflecting an increased preference of serts for dopamine as opposed to serotonin at
the higher temperature. the effects of  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) on sert-mediated dopamine transport were also
evaluated by pre-incubating sert-expressing cells with mdma. the presence of intracellular mdma caused a decrease in [3h]dopamine
uptake but had no effect on [3h]serotonin transport suggesting that intracellular mdma may be capable of inhibiting transporter function.

the abuse of  xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma, ‘ecstasy’) has increased over the past decade
[16]. mdma has been shown to modulate the serotonin (5ht) system by stimulating efflux of 5-ht from serotonergic
neurons through the serotonin transporter (sert) [12]. in
addition to effects on 5-ht release, mdma also stimulates
an acute release of dopamine (da) [16]. rats and nonhuman primates are susceptible to neurochemical changes
in serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain following
mdma administration [10]. abuse of mdma may result in
effects in the human brain, possibly due to damage of
serotonergic neurons [3]. additionally, studies in rats have
yielded significant evidence that mdma behaves as a
selective serotonergic neurotoxin by damaging 5-ht axons
and axon terminals [13]. although efflux of serotonin is
commonly accepted to be the basis for the psychoactive
properties of mdma, the cause of serotonergic neurotoxicity is not known.
evidence exists that da can be transported into 5-ht
terminals [14]. following uptake of da, monoamine
oxidase b (mao-b) present in 5-ht terminals could

deaminate da, yielding reactive dopamine species as well
as  xxxd2298xxx  that may cause oxidative insult,
including membrane lipid peroxidation [18]. other laboratories have shown that reactive oxygen species diminish
naþ/cl2-dependent transporter function [8], consistent
with the finding that 5-ht transport is decreased following
a single dose of mdma [4]. l -deprenyl, a selective mao-b
inhibitor, is able to block mdma-induced lipid peroxidation and long-term 5-ht terminal degeneration in rats
[18]. however, rats pretreated with l -deprenyl experienced
mdma-induced hyperthermia and were not protected
against serotonergic neurotoxicity following multiple
doses of mdma [17]. lack of protection against neurotoxicity by prohibiting formation of reactive oxygen and
dopamine species suggests additional neurotoxic mechanisms beyond oxidative damage.
several studies have shown that mdma produces an
increase in body temperature for 3– 6 h after administration
[7,13]. in addition, several laboratories have demonstrated
that agents that prevent hyperthermia and decrease core
body temperature protect against the neurotoxicity caused
by mdma [9]. even so, the relationship between mdmainduced neurotoxicity and hyperthermia remains unclear.
although da has been shown to move into 5-ht terminals,

the exact mechanism by which da is transported into 5-ht
neurons has not been elucidated. therefore, one purpose of
our studies was to confirm that the cloned sert could
facilitate da uptake. furthermore, we investigated a
possible role of elevated temperature in the propagation of
da transport by sert. our results revealed that sert
transports da, and at increased temperature, the ratio of 5ht to da transport is shifted such that sert has an
increased preference for da. finally, we examined the role
of internal mdma on da transport kinetics to consider a
possible ‘trans’ acceleration effect on da transport.
wild-type hela and hek-293 cells were purchased
from american type culture collection (atcc; manassas,
va). sert plasmids and hek-293 cells stably expressing
 xxxg2150xxx  were provided by dr randy blakely (vanderbilt
university). the recombinant vvt7-3 vaccinia virus was a
generous gift from dr bernard moss (nih).
hela cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (dmem) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs) supplemented with 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin,
and 1% l -glutamine. hek-293 cells stably expressing
 xxxg2150xxx  were maintained in dmem with 10% dialyzed fbs
supplemented with 1% penicillin (50 u/ml), 1% streptomycin (50 mg/ml), 1% l -glutamine, and genetecin ( xxxd2191xxx ;
600 mg/ml). all cells were grown in a 37 8c humidified
environment with 5% co2. transient expression of  xxxg2150xxx 
was accomplished using the recombinant vaccinia virus t7
expression system in hela cells as previously described [1,
2,5]. hela cells expressing  xxxg2150xxx  were assayed 6 –8 h
after transfection. saturation transport kinetic assays were
performed in 24-well culture dishes pre-coated with poly-d lysine. at the time of assay, cells (plated at 75,000 cells per
well) were washed once with 1 £ krebs/ringer’s/hepes
(krh) buffer (120 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 2.2 mm cacl2,
10 mm hepes, 1.2 mm kh2po4, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , ph 7.4).
cells were incubated at 37 or 40 8c with increasing
concentrations of substrate 5-ht (0.625 –20 mm; specific
activity diluted to approximately 2 ci/mmol with unlabeled
5-ht) or da (7.8 –250 mm; specific activity diluted to
approximately 0.2 ci/mmol with unlabeled da) for 5 or 10
min in krh buffer containing d -glucose (1.8 g/l), l  xxxd228xxx  (100 mm),  xxxd2850xxx  (100 mm); the catecholo-methyl transferase inhibitor, ro 41-0960 (100 mm), was
present in assays with da. fluoxetine (10 mm) or cocaine
(10 mm) was used to define non-specific uptake. assays
were terminated by washing twice with krh buffer. the
amount of accumulated [3h]substrate was then determined
using a packard topcount microplate scintillation and
luminescence counter. in experiments with mdma
pretreatment,  xxxg2150xxx /hek-293 cells were washed once
with 1 £ krh buffer, mdma (10 mm) added to the cells,
and plates were incubated at 37 or 40 8c for 1 h prior to
assay. substrate km and vmax values were derived by nonlinear regression curve fitting (one site binding-hyperbola)
with graphpad prism v. 3.02 using the michaelis-menten
equation (y ¼ (vmax p x)/(km þ x)).

to explore sert-mediated uptake of da,  xxxg2150xxx  was
expressed in hek-293 and hela cells. kinetic analysis of
5-ht and da uptake by  xxxg2150xxx /hek-293 cells revealed
significant transport of both substrates at 37 8c (table 1;
fig. 1). no significant specific transport of either substrate
was observed in vector-transfected cells (data not shown)
confirming that the observed uptake was mediated by
 xxxg2150xxx . the vmax value for 5-ht transport by  xxxg2150xxx 
expressed in hek-293 cells was approximately 7-fold
greater than the 5-ht vmax value observed in  xxxg2150xxx /hela
cells which could be due to differences in sert surface
expression levels between the two cell types (fig. 1).
surprisingly, the da transport vmax value from  xxxg2150xxx /
hek-293 cells was over 60-fold higher than that observed
in the  xxxg2150xxx /hela cells (fig. 1). these results are
consistent with previous findings that implicate cell-specific
uptake of substrates by sert [15]. the lack of a
proportional increase in 5-ht and da uptake in the two
cell types suggests that differing sert surface expression
could alter sert transport properties, a phenomenon that
has previously been reported [11]. it is also possible that da
uptake could be influenced by cell-specific factors including
other interacting proteins absent in some cell types or posttranslational modifications. perhaps neural tissue proteins,
in addition to sert, may be affected by mdma, and these
alterations may influence da transport into serotonergic
neurons.
due to the lack of da transport by  xxxg2150xxx  expressed in
hela cells, additional transport properties were examined
only in  xxxg2150xxx /hek-293 cells. kinetic analysis of 5-ht
transport by  xxxg2150xxx  revealed significant changes in relative
affinity and velocity of transport at increased temperature
(table 1). the vmax value for 5-ht transport was nearly 4fold greater at 40 8c as compared to 37 8c. furthermore, the
km value for 5-ht was also greater at 40 8c. these findings
suggest that increased temperature may increase transport
capacity while also reducing the relative affinity of sert
for 5-ht. da transport by  xxxg2150xxx  was less affected by

increased temperature than was 5-ht (table 1). the vmax
value for da was not altered by the increase in temperature
to 408c. although the difference did not achieve statistical
significance, a trend toward a decreased km value for da
was observed at 40 8c as compared to 37 8c (table 1).
although the km value for da uptake by sert at 37 8c was
higher than the km value for 5-ht (75.5 mm vs. 9.5), such a
km value for da is physiologically relevant in that synaptic
concentrations of dopamine have been predicted to reach in
excess of 1 mm [6]. one consideration is the combined
effects of elevated temperature on substrate transport km
values. the ratios of the km values for 5-ht to da at 37 and
40 8c are 0.12 and 1.05, respectively. this 10-fold increase
in the 5-ht:da ratio reflects an increase in preference of
sert for da as opposed to 5-ht at the higher temperature.
such an effect could influence the uptake of da into
serotonergic terminals in response to mdma-induced
hyperthermia.
a common property of transporters is the ability of
internal substrate to accelerate the uptake of external
substrate. this ‘trans’ acceleration phenomenon could
occur as a result of mdma being transported into the cell
and then influencing the uptake of either 5-ht or da. we
did not observe an increase in either 5-ht or da transport
in response to pretreatment with 10 mm mdma (fig. 2).
indeed, following 1-h pretreatment with 10 mm mdma,
da uptake by  xxxg2150xxx  was partially inhibited (fig. 2b)
suggesting that internal mdma may in fact preferentially
alter da uptake without disrupting 5-ht recognition. the
above experiments were performed at 37 8c, however the
effect of internal mdma on 5-ht and da transport by
sert at 40 8c was similar to that observed at 37 8c
suggesting no effect of temperature under these conditions
(data not shown).
our data suggest that at normal physiological temperature (37 8c) as well as at elevated temperature (40 8c), da is
transported into cells expressing  xxxg2150xxx . this finding is
consistent with previous reports that da can be transported
into 5-ht neurons [14] and implicates sert as the

mechanism by which da gains entry into 5-ht terminals.
this mechanism was hypothesized by schmidt and lovenberg in 1985 [14], prior to the cloning of sert. this report
confirms that da can be a substrate for sert at
physiologically relevant concentrations and that elevated
temperature as well as internal mdma may influence the
uptake of da by sert.
