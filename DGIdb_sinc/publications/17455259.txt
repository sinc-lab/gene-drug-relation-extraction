advanced second generation inhibitors of histone deacetylases
(hdac) are currently used in clinical development. this study
aimed at comparing the pharmacological properties of selected
second generation hdac inhibitors with the hydroxamate and
benzamide head group, namely saha,  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx , ci994,
 xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx . in biochemical assays using recombinant
hdac1, 3, 6 and 8 isoenzymes, saha and  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx 
behave as quite unselective hdac inhibitors. in contrast, the benzamides ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  are more selective, potent
inhibitors of at least hdac1 and  xxxg1035xxx . all hdac inhibitors
induce histone h3 hyperacetylation, correlating with inhibition of
proliferation, induction of cell differentiation and apoptosis. a
broad cytotoxicity is seen across cell lines from different tumor
entities with  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx  being the most potent agents. the
apoptosis inducing activity is evident in arrested and proliferating
rko colon cancer cells with inducible, heterologous p21waf1 expression, indicative for a cell-cycle independent mode-of-action.
differentiation of mda-mb468 breast cancer cells is induced by
benzamide and hydroxamate analogs. the reversibility of drug
action was evaluated by pulse treatment of a549 lung cancer cells.
whereas paclitaxel induced irreversible cell cycle alterations already after 6 hr treatment, hdac inhibitor action was retarded
and irreversible after >16 hr treatment. interestingly, pulse treatment was equally effective as continous treatment. finally, the efﬁcacy of  xxxd1797xxx , saha and  xxxd2001xxx  in a549 nude mice xenografts
was comparable to that of paclitaxel at well tolerated doses. we
conclude that despite a different hdac isoenzyme inhibition proﬁle, hydroxamate and benzamide analogs as studied display similar cellular proﬁles.

posttranslational modiﬁcation by reversible acetylation of lysine
residues in histone proteins and their putative role in rna synthesis
was ﬁrst described in 1964 by allfrey et al.1 since this landmark article, the natural antifungal antibiotic  xxxd3426xxx  (tsa) was
found to act by inhibition of mammalian histone deacetylases
(hdac).2 subsequently, the ﬁrst human hdac named hd1 (syn.
hdac1), a homolog of yeast transcriptional regulator  xxxg1033xxx , was isolated.3 since then, enormous progress was made in understanding reversible protein acetylation in general and histone modiﬁcations in
particular.4,5 chromatin condensation and transcriptional activity is
regulated by acetylation of n-terminal lysine residues in core histone
proteins h3 and h4 by histone acetyltransferases (hats) and deacetylation by hdacs. hdacs are components of transcriptional
silencing complexes as ﬁrst described for the mrpd3/n-cor /msin3
complex.6 up to now, 11 different hdac isoenzymes belonging to
the class i (hdac 1, 2, 3, 8), class ii (hdac 4–7, 9, 10) and class
iv families (hdac11) have been described.7 hdac class iii
enzymes, also named sirtuins/sir2 homologs with 7 human isoenzymes (sirt 1–7), are nad1-dependent enzymes and insensitive
to inhibition by hdac class i/ii inhibitors like tsa.8
in model studies on leukemic blasts of acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) patients containing the fusion proteins pml-rara,
aml-eto and plzf-rara, hdacs were found to be aberrantly
recruited to transcription factor complexes, repressing gene transcription and causing a blockade of hematopoietic precursor cell difpublication of the international union against cancer

ferentiation.9,10 on the basis of this rational for targeted interference,
tsa was used to trigger terminal differentiation of primary aml
blasts ex vivo.11 hdac inhibition is now well established as a new
approach for solid and hematological tumor therapy.12–14 studies
with different hdac inhibitors showed broad activity towards cancer cells, namely activation of proapoptotic and inhibition of antiapoptotic pathways, induction of cell differentiation, antiangiogenic
activity and synergism with established and experimental cancer
therapeutics.15–17 it is highly likely that this broad spectrum of activities cannot be explained by affecting transcriptional regulation only.
consequently, hdac substrates different to histone proteins like
stat1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) or stat3,
hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), p53 or a-tubulin have been
described.18–20 there is now growing evidence for hdac functions
distinct from transcriptional regulation, namely for  xxxg1037xxx  in cell
motility and chaperone activity19–21 or  xxxg1039xxx  in association with
a-actin and regulation of smooth muscle cell contractility.22
hdac inhibitors belonging to 4 different chemical classes were/
are evaluated in clinical trials, namely the benzamide ci994/
acetyldinaline analogs  xxxd2001xxx  (berlex-schering ag,23) and
 xxxd2661xxx ,24 the hydroxamate analogs  xxxd3529xxx  (saha, merck25–27),  xxxd297xxx  (topotarget/curagen28),
laq-824/ xxxd2839xxx  (novartis29–31) and cra-024781,32 the butyrate
analog  xxxd3485xxx  (topotarget33) and the cyclic peptolid  xxxd1841xxx /fk228 (gloucester pharma/nci34). the results of phase i
studies of  xxxd1841xxx , saha as well as  xxxd2001xxx  have been published.25,34,35 a complete response was recognized in a heavily pretreated patient with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma at a dose of 400
mg saha given orally twice daily25 and in a patient with peripheral/cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ) treated with  xxxd1841xxx .36 saha recently was approved for treatment of advanced/
refractory  xxxg2343xxx  (zolinzatm, merck inc.). regarding isoenzyme
selectivity, few data have been published until now.26,36,37 furumai
et al. described tsa as an unselective hdac inhibitor in contrast to
 xxxd1841xxx , showing partial selectivity towards hdac class i isoenzymes. richon et al. showed inhibition of hdac1 and  xxxg1035xxx 
by saha with ic50 values of 10 and 20 nm, respectively.

hdac inhibition with benzamide or hydroxamate analogs

we have selected ci994,  xxxd2001xxx ,  xxxd2661xxx , saha and
 xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx  as hdac inhibitors that were or are in clinical
trials for comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies. these studies
included inhibition of recombinant hdac1, 3, 6 and 8 isoenzymes in biochemical assays, induction of hdac regulated
pharmacodynamic effects in cells (histone h3 hyperacetylation,
p21waf1 expression) and induction of breast cancer cell differentiation. the antiproliferative/cytotoxic action was evaluated using
cancer cell lines originating from different tumor types including
rko colon carcinoma cells arrested by induction of heterologous
p21waf1 expression and density arrested normal human bronchial
epithelial (nhbe) cells. finally, the antitumor efﬁcacy of selected
hdac inhibitors towards a549 lung cancer xenografts was compared at the mtd (maximal tolerated dose). although we could
identify clear differences in hdac isoenzyme speciﬁcity, benzamide and hydroxamate analogs as studied behave surprisingly
similar in cellular assays and xenograft studies. we conclude that
a statement regarding superiority of isotype selective benzamide
hdac inhibitors ﬁnally requires phase ii/iii efﬁcacy data.
material and methods
chemicals
hdac inhibitors saha,  xxxd2661xxx ,  xxxd2001xxx , ci-994 (acetyldinaline),  xxxd1797xxx  and  xxxd2839xxx  were synthesized by altana
pharma; tsa (calbiochem no. 647925), cisplatin (gry pharma)
and paclitaxel (sigma no. t1912) were supplied as indicated. in
general hdac inhibitors were dissolved as 20 mm stock solutions
in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and subsequently diluted for respective biochemical and cellular assays.
biochemical hdac assay
hdac activity was isolated from hela nuclear extracts according to a method originally described by dignam et al.38 mass cultures of hek293 cell lines with stable expression of human
hdac1 and  xxxg1037xxx  (kindly provided by e.verdin, gladstone
institute for immunology, san francisco, ca) were lysed and
ﬂag-tagged proteins puriﬁed by m2-agarose afﬁnity chromatography (sigma art. no. a-2220). human  xxxg1035xxx -flag was coexpressed with the smrt dad domain in sf21 insect cells, whereas
human  xxxg1039xxx -flag was expressed without cofactor in sf21 cells.
fractions from the puriﬁcation were analyzed by western blotting
and for speciﬁc activity in the biochemical enzyme assay.
the hdac enzyme activity assay was done as described.39
brieﬂy, 40 ll hela cell nuclear extract, 29 ll enzyme buffer [15
mm tris hcl ph 8.1, 0.25 mm edta, 250 mm nacl, 10% (v/v)
glycerol]; for recombinant hdac isoenzymes, 0.1 mg/ml bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa was added) and 1 ll compound were added
per well of a microtiter plate. the reaction was started by addition
of 30 ll substrate (ac-nh-ggk(ac)-amc ﬁnal 25 lm, thermo
biosciences, ulm, germany). after incubation for 90 min at 30°c,
reaction was terminated by adding 25 ll stop solution (50 mm
tris hcl ph 8, 100 mm nacl, 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 2 lm tsa).
after 40 min incubation at room temperature, ﬂuorescence was
measured using a wallac victor 1420 multilabel counter (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm). the hdac1, 3, 6 and 8 assays
were done with slight modiﬁcations. about 14 ng/well hdac1, 2
ng/well  xxxg1035xxx  or 10 ng/well  xxxg1037xxx  were incubated with 6, 25
or 10 lm ac-nh-ggk(ac)-amc, respectively, for 2 or 3 hr at
30°c. in contrast, 100 ng/well  xxxg1039xxx  were incubated with 50
lm ac-nh-rhk(ac)k(ac)-amc for 3 hr at 30°c. termination
of the reaction and all further steps were done as described earlier
for hela cell nuclear extracts.
for the enzyme kinetic studies with hdac1, selected hdac inhibitor (around ic50 value) as well as ac-nh-ggk(ac)-amc substrate (up to 100 lm) concentrations were evaluated under standard
conditions as described earlier. lineweaver-burk plots were derived
from the reaction rate in lmol/min at deﬁned substrate and inhibitor
concentrations using graphpad prism software.

tumor cell lines
the human tumor cell lines hela (cervical cancer/ccl-2),
a549 (lung cancer/ccl 185), mcf-7 (breast cancer/htb-22) and
mda-mb468 (breast cancer/htb-132) were from atcc (promochem, gemany). the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line
rko and transfectant rkop21waf1 were described recently.40
nhbe cells were supplied by clonetics (cambrex cc-2541). all
cell lines were cultivated at 37°c, 5% co2 in medium as stated on
the atcc and clonetics information sheets or as published.
cellular histone h3 hyperacetylation assay
to quantify the cellular efﬁcacy of hdac inhibitors, an assay
was established in 96-well scale on the cellomics ‘‘arrayscan ii’’
platform. a polyclonal rabbit antibody, speciﬁcally binding to
acetylated histone h3k9114 was used as primary antibody and
alexa fluor 488 labeled goat anti rabbit-igg for counterstaining
as described.41 brieﬂy 5 3 103 hela cells/well in 200 ll dmem
with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) were cultivated in packard view
plates black (art. no. 6005182) for 24 hr before addition of test
compound. after further incubation with test compound for 24 hr,
the culture medium was discarded and cells ﬁxed for 15 min by
addition of 100 ll ﬁxation buffer [3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in
phosphate buffered saline/pbs]. after discarding the ﬁxation
buffer and wash with pbs, cells were permeabilized by addition
of 100 ll/well permeabilization buffer [154 mm nacl, 2.7 mm
na2hpo4, 1.54 mm kh2po4, 0.5% (v/v) triton x-100] for 15
min. after discarding the permeabilization buffer and washing
twice with 100 ll/well blocking solution [pbs with 0.3% (v/v)
tween 20 and 1% (w/v) bsa] at room temperature, the primary
antibody speciﬁc for acetylated histone h3 k9114 (calbiochem
no. 382158) in blocking solution (50 ll/well) was added. after
incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, the wells were washed
twice with 100 ll/well blocking solution before addition of the
secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit alexa fluor 488; mobitec
no. a-11008) in blocking solution (50 ll/well) containing 0.2 lg/
ml hoe33342 for dna staining. after further incubation for 1 hr
at room temperature, wells were washed twice with 100 ll/well
blocking solution. finally, 100 ll/well pbs were added and image
analysis performed on the cellomics ‘‘arrayscan ii.’’ data analysis was done with the algorithm ‘‘mitotic index,’’ calculating normalized nuclear ﬂuorescence intensity. the threshold was set
manually and the percentage of cells above this threshold was
quantiﬁed. the program identiﬁes cells by nuclear staining with
hoe33342, next nuclear ﬂuorescence of alexa fluor 488 quantiﬁes nuclear histone acetylation levels. by comparing histograms
of dmso and positive control treated cells, a threshold ﬂourescence intensity is selected, giving about 80% positive cells in the
hdac inhibitor treated cell population.
in parallel to the cellomics histone h3 hyperacetylation assay,
the cellular efﬁcacy of hdac inhibitors was studied in hela,
mda-mb468 and a549 cell lysates by western blotting. after
treatment with compound for 24 hr, cells were lysed [50 mm tris
hcl ph 8, 150 mm nacl, 1 (v/v) np-40, 0.5% (w/v) na-desoxycholate, 0.2% (w/v) disodiumdodecylsulfate (sds), 0.02 (w/v)
nan3, 1 mm na-vanadate, 20 mm naf, 100 lg/ml pmsf, protease inhibitor mix/roche and 50 u/ml benzonase] and respective
equal amounts of protein separated by sds-page before transfer
to polyvinylidendiﬂuoride/pvdf membrane (biorad) by semidry
blotting. the following antibodies were used for western blot
analysis: ac-histone h3 k9114 (calbiochem no. 382158, polyclonal/rabbit), histone h3 (cell signaling no. 9715, polyclonal/rabbit), p21 (santa cruz no. sc-397, clone c19 rabbit polyclonal),
b-actin (sigma a-5441; clone ac-12, mouse monoclonal).
fireﬂy luciferase reporter gene assay
a reporter gene construct was designed to monitor gene activation by fusing a sequence derived from the p21waf1 promoter
(from 2100 to 250 according to ref. 42) containing 2 sp1
gggcgg response elements 50 to the cmv (cytomegalovirus)
minimal promoter and ﬁreﬂy luciferase. the construct psbc2

(sp1)2 cmvmin luc was stably transfected into hela cells and
the clonal cell line tf 03-3.2c7 with superior inducibility by tsa
was selected for all further experiments. for the homogenous
assay, 1 3 104 cells/well (96-well packard view plate) were cultivated for 24 hr before treatment with test compound. after 16 hr,
cells were lysed in lysis-substrate buffer as described.43 the
induction of ﬁreﬂy luciferase by 10 lm tsa was set 100% and respective ec50 values were calculated from dose-response curves.
proliferation and apoptosis assays
the antiproliferative activity of compounds on normal and
tumor cell lines was evaluated by using the alamar blue (resazurin)
cell viability assay.44 cells were seeded into 96-well ﬂat bottom
plates at respective densities to allow proliferation during 72 hr cultivation with test compound. 24 h after seeding, 1 ll each of the compound dilutions were added per well (n 5 4). after incubation for
72 hr at 37°c in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% carbon
dioxide, cell viability was determined by addition of 20 ll 90 mg/l
resazurin solution (sigma) and subsequent measurement of ﬂuorescence at excitation 544 nm and emission 590 nm as described.44 in
the rkop21waf1 cell system, p21waf1 expression was induced by
treatment with 10 lm ponasterone a for 24 hr.40 rko cells with/
without p21waf1 expression (2 3 104 cells/well induced, 6 3 103
cells/well not induced) were treated with the test compound for
72 hr and metabolic activity quantiﬁed as described earlier.

apoptosis induction in rkop21waf1 cells was measured by using
the cell death detection elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) (art. no. 1774425, roche biochemicals, mannheim, germany) as described in the protocol. apoptosis induction after 48 hr
incubation with test compound was calculated relative to the apoptosis induction by 50 lm cisplatin (5100 cisplatin units/cpu).
for the microscopic analysis, rkop21waf1 cells in subconﬂuent
culture were treated for 48 hr with different drug concentrations.
next, the cells were washed and stained with calcein am and ethidiumbromide homodimer as described in the live/dead assay
kit (molecular probes). stained cells were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy and visual examination of cells with red and
green ﬂuorescent for vital (esterase positive) and damaged cells.
flow cytometry and differentiation assay
for cell cycle analysis, a549 or mda-mb468 cells in subconﬂuent, asynchronous proliferating culture were exposed to the
hdac inhibitor at 37°c, detached with trypsin and ﬁnally collected by centrifugation. in the continuous treatment schedule,
a549 cells were treated with 32 nm  xxxd2839xxx  or 100 nm paclitaxel
for 30, 34, 40, 48 and 56 hr. in the discontinuous schedule (‘‘pulse
treatment’’), a549 cells were treated for 6, 10, 16, 24 and 32 hr
with 32 nm  xxxd2839xxx  or 100 nm paclitaxel, followed by drug withdrawal and cultivation for additional 24 hr. in kinetic experiments,
mda-mb468 cells were continously treated for 11, 16 and 24 hr
with 10 lm  xxxd2001xxx  or15 lm saha. after washing, ﬁxation with

calibur device (becton dickinson). in respective histograms the
percentage of cells as a function of ﬂuorescence intensity (excitation 488 nm, emission 585 nm/fl-2), representing cells within a
deﬁned cell cycle stage (subg1, g1, s and g/2m) were calculated.
for quantiﬁcation of mda-mb468 or mcf-7 cell differentiation,
1 3 106 cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes and, after
cultivation for 24 hr, treated with hdac inhibitor for further 24 or
48 hr. finally, cells were collected by trypsination, washed twice
with pbs and resuspended in 1ml of staining solution (5 lg/ml nile
red in pbs). after incubation for at least 5 min at room temperature, cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on a facs calibur device (excitation 488 nm, emission at 530 nm/fl-1 and (630 nm/fl3). from respective histograms the percentage of cells with ﬂuorescence at 650 nm (phospholipids) and 530 1 650 nm (phospho- and
neutral-lipds) were calculated. for microscopic analysis, mdamb468 cells were cultivated on 2-well chamber slides, treated with
test compound for 24 hr, ﬁxed with 1.5 vol % glutaraldehyde/pbs
and ﬁnally treated with staining solution. after washing with pbs,
cells were analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy.

the parameters evaluated include tumor growth as measured by
palpation, body weight and hemogram (white and red blood cells,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets).
results
hydroxamates like saha and  xxxd1797xxx  are unselective hdac
inhibitors, whereas ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  preferentially
inhibit hdac1 and  xxxg1035xxx  class i enzymes
the hydroxamates saha and  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx  as well as the
benzamides ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  (structures shown in
fig. 1) were selected to determine their hdac inhibitory potency
and selectivity. as summarized in table i, the hydroxamates
saha and  xxxd1797xxx  (similar data for  xxxd2839xxx , not shown) are
potent unselective agents with a complete inhibition of hela nuclear extract hdac activity as well as recombinant hdac1, 3, 6

mean ic50 values were calculated from proliferating cell cultures only (26 different cell lines for laq2824,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx ,20 different cell lines for saha). rkop21waf1 cells were growth arrested in g1/g2 by induction of exogenous p21waf1, whereas nhbe cells were
growth arrested by high cell density. ccrf-cem – vincristine resistant as well as hct215 cell lines overexpress p-glycoprotein and are resistant to mdr substrates like vincristine. for 72 h before quantiﬁcation of metabolic activity, which correlates with cell number.

and 8 with ic50 values from 1.8 nm (hdac1/ xxxd1797xxx ) to 1.2 lm
( xxxg1039xxx /saha). in comparison to hdac1, 3 and 6, the inhibition of  xxxg1039xxx  was signiﬁcantly weaker. the benzamide analogs
ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  are partial inhibitors of hela nuclear extract hdac activity, however showing full and potent inhibition of hdac1 and 3 isoenzymes. in contrast,  xxxg1037xxx  is not
inhibited by hdac inhibitors of the benzamide class up to 100
lm and  xxxg1039xxx  is inhibited at high lm concentrations only (table i). the mode of hdac1 inhibition for  xxxd2001xxx  and saha was
studied by enzyme kinetics using respective lineweaver-burk
transformations of the reaction rate at different substrate and inhibitor concentrations. as shown in figure 2, saha and  xxxd2001xxx 
display a substrate competitive inhibition of hdac1 with ki values of 14 nm and 1.3 lm, respectively.
these results highlight, that the chemical scaffold as deﬁned
primarily by the zn21 complexing head group greatly inﬂuences
the selectivity. in contrast to hydroxamates, benzamide analogs
discriminate between class i enzymes hdac 1/3 and  xxxg1037xxx  as a
class ii representative.

induction of histone h3 hyperacetylation and p21waf1 expression
in hela cervical carcinoma cells
cellular activity was determined by quantiﬁcation of histone
h3 hyperacetylation and of p21waf1 induction. as shown in figure 3
and summarized in table ii, all hdac inhibitors induced concentration-dependently histone h3k9114 hyperacetylation in hela
cervical carcinoma cells (fig. 3a, cellomics assay), veriﬁed by
western blotting (fig. 3c). correlating with histone h3 hyperacetylation, endogenous p21waf1 as well as the luciferase reporter
gene were concentration-dependently induced by all hdac inhibitors. only weak activation up to 10% relative to 10 lm tsa was
observed for the benzamides ci994 and  xxxd2001xxx  in the reporter
gene assay (fig. 3b).
cell-cycle independent antiproliferative, proapoptotic activity
in diverse tumor entities
saha,  xxxd1797xxx ,  xxxd2839xxx ,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  were
tested in a deﬁned cell line panel consisting of 22 tumor and 3 normal cell lines emanating from different tissues/organs (table iii).

figure 5 – cytotoxicity on arrested and proliferating normal
human bronchial epithelial cells. proliferating as well as growth
arrested normal human bronchial epithelial (nhbe) cells were treated
with different concentrations of  xxxd1797xxx , saha and  xxxd2001xxx  and metabolic activity was quantiﬁed after 72 hr. respective concentrationeffect curves are shown.

in addition, rko colon carcinoma cells with inducible expression
of p21waf1 causing a complete cell cycle arrest at g1 and g2 were
included to test for proliferation/cell cycle dependent cytotoxicity 40.
as summarized in table iii, saha,  xxxd1797xxx  and  xxxd2839xxx  (proﬁle
not shown),  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  are broadly active antiproliferative and cytotoxic agents.  xxxd1797xxx  and  xxxd2839xxx  depicted superior
cytotoxic activity with a mean ic50 5 55 nm and 35 nm, respectively, whereas saha,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  were active in the
low lm range (mean ic50 5 3.3, 2.57 and 1.1 lm, respectively).
arrested, nonproliferating rkop21waf1 cells were killed by all
hdac inhibitors, although concentration-effect curves in the alamar blue proliferation assay were slightly rightward shifted (fig.
4a). induction of apoptosis was quantiﬁed by the cell death detection
elisa and live/dead staining. in both assays, all hdac inhibitors induced apoptosis in arrested and proliferating rko cells,
although to a lesser extent in arrested rko cells (figs. 4b and 4c,
exempliﬁed by saha).
the action towards proliferating and density arrested nhbe
cells was also studied. nhbe cells are arrested by contact inhibition were partially protected towards hdac inhibitors as exempliﬁed by saha, displaying ic50 values of 1.3 lm (proliferating)
versus 29 lm (arrested), discriminating by a factor of 22 (fig. 5).
comparable results were obtained for  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx ,  xxxd2001xxx 
and  xxxd2661xxx  discriminating by a factor of 7, 18 and 5, respectively (data for  xxxd2839xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  not shown).
in summary, the hdac inhibitors as studied are cell-cycle independent antiproliferative, proapoptotic agents with broad antitumor activity, discriminating between proliferating and arrested
normal cells.
induction of breast cancer cell differentiation
differentiation of the breast cancer cell line mcf-7 by saha
was described recently,45 but the differentiation inducing activity
of benzamide analogs is not published. therefore, we studied the
induction of neutral lipid droplets (triglyceride synthesis) as a
hallmark of differentiated breast cells by saha and  xxxd1797xxx  in
comparison to  xxxd2001xxx . initially, the kinetics of histone h3 hyperacetylation, p21waf1 induction and cell cycle alterations in mdamb468 cells at ic90 concentrations of saha and  xxxd2001xxx  were
determined. as shown in figure 6a, histone h3 hyperactylation
became evident after 8 hr. the induction of p21waf1 by saha and
 xxxd2001xxx  was obvious after 8 and 12 hr, respectively. consistent
with these data, a time-dependent depletion of cells in s-phase and
partial arrest in g2/m, followed by apoptosis was seen by ﬂow
cytometry (fig. 6b). compared to saha, the effects of  xxxd2001xxx 
were slightly delayed. next, mda-mb468 and mcf-7 as a positive control were stained with the vital dye nile red binding to
neutral and phospholipids. the induction of neutral lipid containing droplets after treatment of mda-mb468 cells for 24 hr with
saha,  xxxd1797xxx  and  xxxd2001xxx  is shown in fig. 6c.  xxxd2001xxx  at

figure 6 – induction of mda-mb468 breast cancer cell differentiation. mda-mb468 cells were treated with saha and  xxxd2001xxx  at
ic90 concentrations (15 and 10 lm, respectively) for different times,
followed by western blot analysis (a; p21waf1 and histone h3 hyperacetylation, b-actin as control). in parallel, hdac inhibitor treated
cells cells were analysed by ﬂow cytometry and the percentage of cells
in deﬁned stages of the cell cycle are shown in b. finally, mdamb468 cells were treated for 24 and 48 hr with different concentrations of saha,  xxxd1797xxx  and  xxxd2001xxx  and stained with nile red. lipid
droplets/neutral lipids are stained yellow-green (see arrows in ﬂuorescence microscopic ﬁgure). quantitative data are summarized in c
(shown: percentage of cells staining positive for polar and neutral
lipids).

10 lm concentration induced neutral lipids in 38% of cells, which
is comparable to 15 lm saha (36%) and 0.1 lm  xxxd1797xxx 
(37%). comparable results were obtained with mcf-7 cells (data
not shown).
from these experiments we conclude, that induction of breast
cancer cell differentiation coincides with p21waf1 induction,

figure 7 – cell cycle analysis of a549 cells after continous and discontinous treatment. continuously proliferating a549 non small cell lung
cancer cells were analysed by ﬂow cytometry after dna staining. cells were treated with (a) 32 nm  xxxd2839xxx  or (b)100 nm paclitaxel. in the
discontinous, pulse treatment schedule, a549 cells were treated for times as indicated before further 24 hr cultivation without drug. the histograms show selected times for pulse- and continous-treatment.

as potent as saha.
reversibility of action in a549 nsclc
the reversibility of drug action is an important feature for cancer therapy, in particular to estimate the exposure time needed to
eliminate the cancer cells in a patient. two treatment schedules
were pursued, namely a discontinuous, pulse treatment and a continuous treatment without drug withdrawal. cell cycle alterations
in both schedules as a function of time were determined by ﬂow

cytometry.  xxxd2839xxx  and paclitaxel at relevant ic90 concentrations
(32 nm and 100 nm, respectively) were selected. as shown in figure 7a for  xxxd2839xxx , irreversible cell cycle alterations were
induced after 16 hr treatment and massive apoptosis (cells in
subg1) was detectable after 24 and 32 hr. respective histograms
are shown for discontinous and continous treatment with  xxxd2839xxx .
interestingly, discontinous treatment was as effective as continous
treatment. comparable results were seen with hdac inhibitors
from different classes and potency (data not shown). as a reference compound, the stabilizing tubulin inhibitor paclitaxel was
included, showing an irreversible mode-of-action after 6 hr

treatment (fig. 7b). a distinct arrest in the m-phase is seen as
expected from this tubulin targeting agent.
in summary,  xxxd2839xxx  at ic90 concentration induced irreversible
cell cycle alterations in a549 nsclc (nonsmall cell lung cancer)
cells after 16 hr treatment, with discontinuous treatment being
as effective as continous treatment. comparable results were
obtained with other advanced second generation hydroxamate and
benzamide analogs.
comparison of tolerability and efﬁcacy in a549 xenograft
experiments
finally saha,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd1797xxx  were evaluated for efﬁcacy in nude mice a549 xenograft experiments. paclitaxel given
at a dose of 15 mg/kg i.v. served as a positive control. for all
compounds the clinically relevant application route was preferred, namely orally for saha and  xxxd2001xxx  and intravenously
for  xxxd1797xxx . doses were selected close to the mtd to allow
comparison of efﬁcacy and tolerability data (for details see table
iv). all hdac inhibitory compounds showed antitumor efﬁcacy
in the range of 0.23–0.35 values for best t/c (tumor versus control) (vol % of mean), slightly less active than paclitaxel at optimal dose. tolerability in general was good with body weight loss
of 6% (at day 7) for  xxxd2001xxx  only. thus, all compounds are
active in the a549 tumor xenograft with comparable tolerability
and efﬁcacy.
discussion
there is growing evidence for reversible protein acetylation as
an important posttranslational modiﬁcation, regulating diverse biological processes including gene transcription.46 in this regard,
deacetylation of core histone proteins by hdacs in the context of
gene repression is well understood.4 for example in aml, leukemia associated fusion proteins like aml-eto are causing aberrant recruitment of hdacs into respective transcriptional
repressor complexes.10 inhibition of hdac activity triggered
aml/apl blast differentiation or resensitization towards all-trans
 xxxd3417xxx  therapy.11,47 stimulated by these studies and evidence for antitumor activity of ﬁrst generation hdac inhibitors,
namely tsa, butyrate analogs and  xxxd1841xxx /fk228, pharmaceutical companies initiated programs to develop optimized second generation analogs. as a result, saha,  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx ,
cra024781 and  xxxd297xxx  as analogs of the hydroxamic acid
tsa, and ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  as benzamides have
entered clinical trials. we selected saha,  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx ,
ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  for a comparative study.
until now, few data on the isoenzyme selectivity of hdac
inhibitors are published.24,26,36,37 furumai et al. described tsa as
an unselective hdac inhibitor with ic50 values from 5 to 28 nm
for hdacs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10 and ic50 5 490 nm for  xxxg1039xxx .36 in
contrast,  xxxd1841xxx /fk228 depicted some preference towards
inhibition of hdac1 and 2 (ic50 5 36 nm and 47 nm, respectively) versus hdac 4 and 6 (ic50 5 510 nm and 14 lm, respectively). li et al. used recombinant hdac1 and  xxxg1035xxx , showing
inhibition of ic50 5 148 nm and 119 nm, respectively, for saha
and inhibition of hdac1 by  xxxd2001xxx  with ic50 5 5.99 lm.37
finally,  xxxd2661xxx  inhibited hdac1, 2, 3 and 11 with ic50
from 0.1 to 2 lm and hdacs 4–8 with ic50 values >20 lm.24

our own data using hela nuclear extract hdac activity as well
as recombinant hdac1, 3, 6 and 8 showed complete inhibition in
all assays by the hydroxamates saha and  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx  supporting a broad inhibition of class i and ii enzymes. in contrast,
benzamide analogs ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  in this experimental setting typically showed ﬂat concentration-effect curves
and evidence for partial inhibition only. this is explained by
selective hdac isoenzyme inhibition: whereas hdac1 and 3 are
potently inhibited, weak  xxxg1039xxx  and no inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx  up
to 100 lm were seen. enzyme kinetic studies with hdac1 revealed a substrate competitive inhibition mode for  xxxd2001xxx  (ki 5
1.3 lm) as well as saha (ki 5 14 nm). we conclude that
ci994,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx  are isotype-selective inhibitors
with reduced potency in biochemical assay compared to saha
and  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx .
we next studied the effects on hela cervical carcinoma cells,
the source for the hdac activity assay. we tested for induction of
histone h3 hyperacetylation, of endogenous p21waf1 expression
and of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by a p21waf1 promoter
fragment. these functional assays for cellular hdac inhibition
were compared to cytotoxicity. cells were treated with hdac
inhibitors for 16–24 hr in the functional assays and for 48 and 72
hr in the apoptosis and proliferation assays, respectively. in general, cellular histone h3 hyperacetylation and p21waf1 gene induction correlated well with cytotoxicity (table ii). nevertheless, the
induction of luciferase reporter gene expression by ci994 and
 xxxd2001xxx  was only about 10% compared to 10 lm tsa, which
could not be explained by cytotoxicity (data not shown). sp1 transcription factor binding sites in proximity to the tata box of the
p21waf gene have been described as tsa responsive elements.48
we therefore hypothesize that hdac class i isotype selective
benzamide analogs represented by ci994 and  xxxd2001xxx  in this study
inhibit transcription factor complexes distinct from those adressed
by unselective hydroxamate analogs like saha.
the antiproliferative activity of hdac inhibitors was studied
in detail by using a broad selection of tumor and normal cell lines.
in vitro, saha,  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx ,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd2661xxx 
were broadly active with mean ic50 values of 3.3 lm, 55 nm/35
nm, 2.57 lm and 1.1 lm, respectively. this results shows the
superior potency of  xxxd1797xxx / xxxd2839xxx  in vitro. apoptosis was
induced in various cell lines by hdac inhibitors of both classes
comparable to the standard 50 lm cisplatin (data not shown).
interestingly, proliferating and arrested rko colon carcinoma
cells were killed with comparable efﬁcacy by all hdac inhibitors. concentration effect curves were slightly right shifted in the
arrested state, as shown for saha,  xxxd2001xxx  and  xxxd1797xxx  in figure
4a. also, the induction of apoptosis was retarded in arrested versus
proliferating rko cells. comparable data were published recently
for tsa treated sk-mel13 melanoma cells with inducible
 xxxg421xxx  expression and normal serum-starved forskin ﬁbroblasts.49
the reversibility of action of hdac inhibitors was simulated
by discontinous and continous drug treatment. in model experiments with a549 nsclc cells, pulse treatment was similar effective as continous treatment. up to 16 hr treatment, the effects of
hdac inhibitors as exempliﬁed by  xxxd2839xxx  are largely reversible
(fig 7a). this contrasts paclitaxel, where irreversible cell cycle
alterations were induced already after 6 hr or earlier. this result
indicates that prolonged, but not continous hdac inhibitor expo-

hdac inhibition with benzamide or hydroxamate analogs

sure at concentrations above the ic50 are needed to induce potent
apoptosis and antitumor efﬁcacy in patients.
another hallmark of hdac inhibitor action is the induction of
tumor cell differentiation as described for saha.45 we addressed
the question what discriminates hydroxamates as pan-hdac
inhibitors from benzamides as more selective agents with respect
to induction of breast cancer cell differentiation. we treated
mda-mb468 and mcf-7 breast cancer cell lines with hdac
inhibitors of both classes and quantiﬁed neutral lipid synthesis as a
marker for differentiation into milk fat producing breast cells. in
parallel we studied the kinetics of histone h3 hyperacetylation,
p21waf1 induction, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.
 xxxd2001xxx , saha and  xxxd1797xxx  at about ic90 concentrations induced
neutral lipid synthesis in both breast cancer cell lines, most prominent between 24 and 48 hr. the induction of histone h3 hyperacetylation and p21waf1 precedes depletion of cells in s-phase, followed by induction of differentiation and ﬁnally strong apoptosis
after 48 hr. therefore, the induction of differentiation is transient
and coupled to ﬁnal apoptotic cell death in this experimental
system. since  xxxd2001xxx  as a benzamide representative was equally
active, transcriptional reprogramming by inhibition of at
least hdac1 and 3 isoenzymes seems crucial for differentiation
induction.
finally we compared selected hdac inhibitors for in vivo efﬁcacy and their therapeutic window. for the a549 xenograft experiments, the compounds were dosed at the mtd using the preferred
application route, namely oral application for  xxxd2001xxx  or saha
and intravenous application for  xxxd1797xxx . all compounds showed
very good antitumor activity with best t/c values between 0.23
and 0.35. comparable data were obtained in various other tumor
models, e.g. for saha at 60 or 120 mg/kg in the rko, hct15
and hct116 colon carcinoma and mda-mb468 breast carcinoma models (t/c values in the range of 0.4–0.83; data not
shown). surprisingly, the about 50-fold higher in vitro potency of
 xxxd1797xxx  did not translate into a more potent antitumor activity
in vivo, possibly explained by a rapid metabolism or excretion. all
hdac inhibitors were well tolerated with minor body weight loss
in  xxxd2001xxx  treated animals only. comparable data were published
for  xxxd2001xxx  with potent in vivo activity at the mtd of 49 mg/kg
given orally 5 days/week23 and  xxxd1797xxx  with 50 mg/kg given

1147

intravenously 5 days/week, causing a t/c 5 0.15 in the a549
model.50 one explanation for the therapeutic window seen in the
xenograft studies is a certain degree of discrimination between
proliferating and arrested normal cells. as a model, we used proliferating and density arrested, nonproliferating nhbe cells. with
a factor of 22, saha showed the highest discrimination. a selective induction of apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species by saha has been published recently for sv-40 transformed
wi-38 human lung ﬁbroblasts, compared to the parental normal
cell line.51 mechanistically, this was explained by about 2-fold
enhanced thioredoxin expression in saha treated normal cells
only, antagonizing reactive oxygen species. this type of tumor
cell selectivity, also shown for  xxxd1797xxx  in normal human dermal
ﬁbroblasts,30 might contribute to the therapeutic window seen in
xenograft studies and clinical trials.
in summary, this comparative study with second generation
hdac inhibitors conﬁrmed many features of this new class of
cancer agents. these features include transient induction of cell
differentiation, cell cycle independent growth arrest and apoptosis
induction, a broad activity spectrum across many tumor types and
hints to understand the therapeutic window seen in patients.
clearly, the kinetics and mechanisms differ from traditional, cytotoxic agents like paclitaxel. surprinsingly, the pharmacological
cellular proﬁle of broad, unselective hydroxamate and isotype
selective benzamide hdac inhibitors is quite similar. further
studies addressing the biological functions of hdac isoenzymes
by using more selective hdac inhibitors certainly will be needed
for translation into more efﬁcacious and tolerable therapy with
this new class of agents.
