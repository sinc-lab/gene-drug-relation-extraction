pathophysiology of migraine —
new insights
rj hargreaves and sl shepheard

abstract: current theories propose that the primary dysfunction in migraine occurs within the cns and that this evokes changes
in blood vessels within pain-producing intracranial meningeal structures that give rise to headache pain. migraine is now thought of as
a neurovascular disorder. it has been proposed that genetic abnormalities may be responsible for altering the response threshold to
migraine specific trigger factors in the brain of a migraineur compared to a normal individual. the exact nature of the central
dysfunction that is produced in migraineurs is still not clear and may involve spreading depression-like phenomena and activation of
brain stem monoaminergic nuclei that are part of the central autonomic, vascular and pain control centers. it is generally thought that
local vasodilatation of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels and a consequent stimulation of surrounding trigeminal sensory nervous
pain pathways is a key mechanism underlying the generation of headache pain associated with migraine. this activation of the
‘trigeminovascular system’ is thought to cause the release of vasoactive sensory neuropeptides, especially cgrp, that increase the pain
response. the activated trigeminal nerves convey nociceptive information to central neurons in the brain stem trigeminal sensory nuclei
that in turn relay the pain signals to higher centers where headache pain is perceived. it has been hypothesized that these central neurons
may become sensitized as a migraine attack progresses. the ‘ xxxd3263xxx ’ anti-migraine agents (e.g. sumatriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx 
naratriptan) are serotonergic agonists that have been shown to act selectively by causing vasoconstriction through 5-ht1b receptors that
are expressed in human intracranial arteries and by inhibiting nociceptive transmission through an action at  xxxg1110xxx  receptors on
peripheral trigeminal sensory nerve terminals in the meninges and central terminals in brain stem sensory nuclei. these three
complementary sites of action underlie the clinical effectiveness of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists against migraine headache pain and its
associated symptoms.

résumé: physiopathologie de la migraine – nouveaux concepts. les théories actuelles proposent que la dysfonction primaire dans la migraine est
localisée dans le snc et qu’elle provoque des changements dans les vaisseaux sanguins localisés dans les structures méningées intracrâniennes
produisant ainsi la douleur. la céphalée résulte de ces changements. on pense maintenant que la migraine est un désordre neurovasculaire. des
anomalies génétiques pourraient être responsables de l’altération du seuil de la réponse aux facteurs spécifiques déclenchant la migraine dans le cerveau
d’un migraineux comparé à un individu normal. la nature exacte de la dysfonction centrale chez les migraineux n’est pas encore claire et pourrait
impliquer un phénomène qui se propage ressemblant à la dépression et à l’activation des noyaux monoaminergiques du tronc cérébral qui font partie
des centres autonomes, vasculaires et du contrôle de la douleur. on pense en général que la vasodilatation locale des vaisseaux sanguins intracrâniens
extracérébraux et une stimulation des voies sensitives nociceptives adjacentes du trijumeau constituent un mécanisme clé dans la production de la
céphalée associée à la migraine. on pense que cette activation du “système trigéminovasculaire” provoque la libération de neuropeptides sensitifs
vasoactifs, spécialement du cgrp qui augmente la réponse douloureuse. les nerfs trijumeaux activés amènent l’information nociceptive aux neurones
centraux situés dans les noyaux sensitifs trigéminés du tronc cérébral qui, à leur tour, relayent les signaux douloureux aux centres supérieurs où la
douleur est perçue. on a émis l’hypothèse que ces neurones centraux peuvent devenir sensibilisés à mesure que l’accès de migraine progresse. les
agents antimigraineux de la famille du  xxxd3263xxx  (sumatriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan) sont des agonistes sérotoninergiques dont l’action
sélective sur les récepteurs 5-ht1b, exprimés dans les artères intracrâniennes humaines, cause une vasoconstriction et inhibe la transmission nociceptive
par leur action sur les récepteurs  xxxg1110xxx  situés sur les terminaisons nerveuses sensitives périphériques du trijumeau dans les méninges et sur les
terminaisons centrales dans les noyaux sensitifs du tronc cérébral. ces trois sites complémentaires d’activité expliquent l’efficacité clinique des
agonistes 5-ht1b/1d contre la migraine et ses symptômes associés.

the specific cause of common forms of migraine headache is
unknown but studies on families suffering from familial
hemiplegic migraine (fhm) have suggested that genetic factors
may be involved.1,2 in fhm, a rare subtype of migraine with
aura, missense mutations in a neuronal specific p/q calcium
channel gene that give rise to amino acid substitutions in the
pore-forming and voltage sensor regions of the alpha 1a subunit
of the channel have been identified. it was hypothesized that
these changes may provide the basis for channel and consequent

brain dysfunction in fhm sufferers. recent studies from hans
and colleagues3 have shown that these mutations produce a
constellation of changes in channel expression and kinetics that
result both in a net gain and a net loss of function. fhm is

thought to be a genetically simple (autosomal dominant)
disorder, whereas the more common migraine variants are likely
to be genetically complex (multifactorial polygenic) with a
substantial influence from ‘environmental factors’ that increase
genetic penetrance to produce the observed phenotype. the
study of fhm has nonetheless given a framework for the study
of other migraine disorders (see review by kathy gardner, this
supplement). there is, however, no doubt that deciphering the
genetic basis of common migraine with and without auras is
going to be a monumental task.
it has been suggested that it is theoretically possible for all
individuals to suffer a migraine attack. the occurrence and
frequency of attacks in any individual will be governed by the
responsivity of their cns to migraine specific triggers (e.g. certain
foods, hormones, changes in levels of stress, consciousness and
even exposure to light and sound). it has been hypothesized that
genetic abnormalities result in a lowered threshold of response to
these specific trigger factors in migraineurs. the trigger factors
can thus be conceptualized as modulators of the genetic set point
that predisposes to migraine. conversely, in normal individuals,
who lack genetic deficits relevant to migraine, exposure to the
same trigger factors would not breach the ‘migraine threshold’ and
so an attack would not be initiated. it is possible that the abnormal
hyper-responsivity of the brain of migraineurs, like fhm, may be
a consequence of genetic abnormalities in ion channels that
regulate neuronal excitability. this has given rise to the description
of migraine as a channelopathy.4
the theory suggests that, as a result of this channelopathy,
migraine specific triggers can provoke marked cns dysfunction
that can characterize and initiate the early stages of a migraine
attack. in this respect, the presence of blood flow changes, both
oligemia and hyperaemia, have been taken to be indicative of
altered cns activation and have supported a role for spreading
depression, or indeed activation, in migraine (particularly with
aura) pathogenesis.5,6,7,8 it is interesting to speculate that the
presence or absence of aura may also reflect a threshold
phenomenon that is determined by the extent of the early cns
dysfunction produced by migraine trigger factors. such an
explanation could accommodate those patients who present
symptoms of migraine with aura and migraine without aura. the
first clear observation in support of the integrated hypothesis was
that patients with no history of migraine developed migraine-like
episodes after surgery to implant electrodes in the periaqueductal
grey matter and raphe nuclei in the brain stem.9 more recent
research using neuroimaging has shown these specific nuclei
(raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey) to be
selectively activated in the brain stem of migraine patients
during a spontaneous migraine attack.10 these nuclei are
involved in signal integration within pathways that modulate
craniovascular status and that provide endogenous pain control.
this pattern of activation appears to be unique to migraineurs
since similar patterns are not as pronounced in cluster headache
(much lower significance scores in brain stem than hypothalamic
gray)11 nor seen in experimental capsaicin-induced clinical head
pain.12 most recently, mri studies have also revealed that the red
nucleus and the brain stem dopaminergic region of the substantia
nigra may become activated in concert with the occipital cortex
during the visual aura of migraine.13 it was suggested that
dysfunction in these brain stem nuclei could also be involved in

a perturbation of endogenous pain control systems and underlie
the disturbances in autonomic gastrointestinal dopaminergic
functions associated with migraine. it is noteworthy that
migraineurs are supersensitive to the dopamine agonist
apomorphine,14 and that dopamine antagonists primarily relieve
the gastrointestinal stasis and nausea associated with a migraine
attack.15,16 whilst this observation offers a potential explanation
for the efficacy of dopamine antagonists such as  xxxd3018xxx  and metoclopramide in migraine therapy, the changes in
these dopaminergic nuclei were not sustained during the
headache pain phase, which is when these drugs are commonly
given in the emergency room setting.
current opinion is therefore that migraine is a ‘neurovascular’
disorder. in migraineurs, it is proposed that genetic abnormalities
cause an inability to handle migraine trigger factors adequately
and result in a primary neural dysfunction within the cns.
indeed, studies have shown that the brain of migraineurs has
altered responsivity to transcranial magnetic stimulation.17,18 the
central dysfunction probably then activates brain stem
autonomic nuclei, that then initiate the processes that lead to
headache pain.6 the early studies of harold wolff19,20 showed
that the brain itself was relatively insensate,whereas stimulation
of the intracranial extracerebral vasculature was associated with
acute pain. the generation of migraine headache pain is now
thought to involve cns dysfunction that leads to dilatation of the
vasculature in intracranial extracerebral tissues and a consequent
activation of the trigeminal sensory nerves that then relay pain
signals to the brain.
trigeminovascular pathophysiology of headache pain
although the central processes involved in the initiation of a
migraine attack are relatively poorly understood, considerably
more is known about the factors involved in the pathophysiology
of migraine headache pain. the brain has a sparse sensory
innervation and, like other viscera, it is the capsule structures
(meninges) that are the most significant pain producing
intracranial tissues.21,22,23 primarily the ophthalmic division of
the trigeminal nerve (v cranial nerve) innervates the meninges.
the trigeminal nerves arise from pseudo-unipolar neurones in
the trigeminal ganglia and project to the intracranial extracerebral blood vessels in the meninges (peripheral terminals) and
behind the blood brain barrier into the trigeminal nuclei in the
brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord (central terminals).
these fibres therefore provide a pathway for pain signal
transmission from meningeal blood vessels into the brain where
headache pain is registered. this system has been described
collectively as the ‘trigeminovascular’ system.
our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms
involved in migraine pain has been enhanced by increased
knowledge of the serotonin receptor distribution within the
trigeminovascular system and their functional pharmacology.
this has been driven by the introduction of highly effective acute
anti-migraine drug therapies and in particular, the selective
serotonin receptor agonists that have become collectively known
as the triptans. the 5-ht1b/1d agonists currently available for
clinical use are sumatriptan (imitrex®),  xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd3135xxx ®)
naratriptan (amerge®) and  xxxd3562xxx  (zomig®) with  xxxd1976xxx 
a fifth entrant currently in the late stages of the regulatory
approval process.

migraine treatment strategies
there are several possible anti-migraine approaches that
could be followed based on the scheme for migraine
pathophysiology that has been proposed above.
for example, migraine prophylactic agents could inhibit the
central processes involved in the initiation of a migraine attack
or prevent meningeal vasodilatation and so stop the occurrence
of migraine pain. indeed, it has been speculated that the key
mode of action of sodium valproate is to enhance activity within
central inhibitory pathways by promoting the release of the
neurotransmitter gaba through a blocking action at terminal
ion channels. calcium channel antagonists such as verapamil and
 xxxd2125xxx  reduce neuronal activation directly by blocking
voltage gated calcium channels. the serotonin antagonist  xxxd2022xxx  agents (e.g. pizotifen,  xxxd2621xxx ) have been
suggested to block the initial meningeal vasodilator step in the
migraine pathogenesis pathway through blocking 5-ht2b
receptors that have been proposed to mediate a  xxxd2738xxx 
dependent vasodilatation.24 indeed, there have been strong
arguments for a pivotal role for  xxxd2738xxx  (no) in mediating
the vasodilator and inflammatory effects of vasoactive
neuropeptides and in the sensitization of perivascular sensory
nerves.25 in support of this hypothesis, it has been observed that
migraineurs are supersensitive to no-donors such as glyceryl
trinitrate26 and there is preliminary evidence that no-synthase
inhibitors may be effective anti-migraine agents.27 the mode of
action of the adrenergic -blockers (propranolol, metoprolol,
 xxxd2689xxx ) and brain penetrant serotonin antagonists is also likely
to be central by inhibition of the monoaminergic nuclei (raphe
nuclei (5-ht) and locus coeruleus (ne)) that become activated
at the onset of an attack, thereby preventing disturbances in
vascular control systems. older agents such as amitriptyline also
work centrally but it is difficult to discern the critical mechanism
involved in their actions because of their rich receptor and ion
channel pharmacology. it is clear, however, that all these
prophylactic strategies are of little value once a migraine attack
has progressed to the point at which the trigeminovascular
system has become activated. at this time then, a different
therapeutic approach is needed to reverse migraine headache
pain.
key steps in migraine headache pain
current theories suggest that after an initial cns dysfunction,
there are three key processes in the generation of migraine
headache pain. these mechanisms have been carefully studied in
the clinic and with experimental models. the first key process is
thought to involve meningeal blood vessel dilation.20,28 as the
arteries swell, they activate perivascular sensory trigeminal
nerves causing pain impulses to be transmitted to the caudal
brain stem nuclei. activation of these nerve terminals triggers the
second key process in migraine – a release of vasoactive
neuropeptides.21,29 these substances worsen and perpetuate
vasodilatation, setting up a vicious cycle that increases
meningeal blood vessel diameter further, thereby increasing
nerve activation and intensifying headache pain. the most
notable of these peptides is  xxxg2240xxx ,  xxxg2240xxx  and
calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp).30  xxxg2240xxx  primarily
increases blood vessel permeability (with transient dilation),

 xxxg2240xxx  has longer lasting effects on permeability and blood
vessel calibre whereas cgrp produces a profound and long
lasting vasodilatation but has no effects on blood vessel
permeability. indeed, the vasodilator effects of cgrp potentiate
the permeability effects of the neurokinins. their effects are
mediated primarily by endothelial  xxxg2240xxx  (nk1) receptors
and  xxxd2738xxx  release ( xxxg2240xxx ) and by actions directly on
vascular smooth muscle (cgrp). the third key event involves
the relay of pain impulses from the activated peripheral sensory
nerves to second order sensory neurones within trigeminal nuclei
in the caudal brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord
(trigeminocervical complex).31 it has been hypothesized that
these central sensory neurones may become sensitized during
migraine. this sensitization may be responsible for the
intensification of headache pain as an attack progresses and for
an increased sensitivity to convergent sensory stimuli from
extracranial tissues.32,33,34 the trigeminal sensitization process
may underlie the facial sensory disturbances that are sometimes
associated with migraine and perhaps also underpins its
transformation in some individuals to a more chronic condition.
the trigeminal nuclei are then responsible for relaying incoming
pain signals to higher cortical centres where migraine pain is
registered. symptoms commonly associated with a migraine
attack such as nausea, phono and photophobia are produced
when other associated central nuclei and pathways are activated.
an ideal acute anti-migraine therapy would target these three
key processes occurring in the trigeminovascular system that
give rise to headache pain. it is noteworthy that acute  xxxd2022xxx  agents that target the trigeminovascular system have
little or no therapeutic value as prophylactics since this system is
not in play until headache pain has started.
5-ht1 receptor subtype distribution in
trigeminovascular pathways

vasoconstrictor 5-ht1b receptors. detailed molecular
biology mapping of mrna and immunohistochemistry for
receptor protein have shown conclusive evidence for substantial
populations of 5-ht1b receptors on human meningeal blood
vessels.35,36 these receptors are localized on the smooth muscle
and mediate vasoconstriction. the 5-ht1b receptors are thus
ideally placed to reverse the dilation of meningeal vessels that is
thought to occur during a migraine attack. evidence for 5-ht1b
receptors has also been found on human coronary arteries37
making it important to establish the relative contribution of this
subtype to the contractile responses in coronary arteries as well
as in the target meningeal blood vessels (see discussion below).
vasodilator 5-ht1b and 5-ht7 receptors. it is fascinating to
see that evidence is now emerging for 5-ht1b and 5-ht7
receptors on vascular endothelium which could mediate
vasodilatation. these receptors could be involved in the
pathogenesis of migraine by initiating the meningeal
vasodilatation that activates the trigeminovascular system. it is
therefore possible that a 5-ht7 antagonist could be a migraine
prophylactic agent. these vasodilator endothelial 5-ht receptors
could also have a role in migraine headache recurrence with the
serotonin agonist anti-migraine agents. thus endothelial 5-ht1b
and 5-ht7 receptors could remain preferentially activated as
plasma concentrations fall with time after dosing when 5-ht1bmediated vasoconstrictor effects diminish. it is interesting to

suppl. 3 – s14

le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques

speculate that 5-ht1b and 5-ht7 receptors could be the link to
the vasculature for the early observations (decrease in platelet 5ht and increased urinary 5-ht metabolite 5-hiaa) that
suggested serotonergic activation as a key early process in the
initiation of a migraine attack.
trigeminal inhibitory  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors. studies
on the localization of 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors in human
trigeminal ganglia and trigeminal nerves have produced a series
of interesting findings. mapping studies in ganglia have been
inconclusive, showing mrna evidence either for both
subtypes38 or purely for  xxxg1110xxx  receptor expression.39,40
immunohistochemical receptor protein mapping has shown that
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors are present on cell bodies in human
trigeminal ganglia. however, only  xxxg1110xxx  receptors were
detected in trigeminal nerves projecting peripherally to the dural
vasculature and centrally to the brain stem trigeminal nuclei.36
activation of such prejunctional receptors on nerve terminals is
known to modulate neurotransmitter release. the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors are thus ideally placed peripherally, to inhibit activated
trigeminal nerves and promote normalization of blood vessel
calibre by preventing vasoactive neuropeptide release and
centrally, to interrupt pain signal transmission from the blood
vessels to second order sensory neurones in the brain stem.
interestingly,  xxxg1110xxx  receptors were also localized within the
solitary tract nucleus in the brain stem36 which receives
trigeminal inputs and is involved in the autonomic regulation of
nausea and vomiting – two effects often clinically important in
migraine.
a trigeminal location has recently been described for  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors41 where its prejunctional pharmacological effects are
thought likely to be similar to those of the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
(inhibition of sensory nerve activation and peptide release in the
periphery and interruption of nociceptive transmission within
central trigeminal nuclei). however,  xxxg1112xxx  receptors are also
relatively abundant throughout the brain raising the possibility
that its activation centrally may have other effects in addition to
trigeminal inhibition.42  xxxg1112xxx  mrna has also been demonstrated in human blood vessels although there appears to be no
expression of functional receptors since  xxxg1112xxx  agonists appear
devoid of vascular effects.43
5-ht receptor profile of acute anti-migraine drugs
the serotonin receptor family is currently grouped into seven
subfamilies (5-ht1 to 5-ht7) and fourteen receptor subtypes that
have different anatomical locations.44 the most common sites of
action for effective serotonergic agonist acute anti-migraine
drugs (ergots and the 5-ht1b/1d agonists) appear to be through
vasoconstrictor 5-ht1b receptors on the meningeal vasculature
and inhibitory  xxxg1110xxx  receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals.
older anti-migraine compounds such as the ergot alkaloids
have strong affinity for the anti-migraine 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors but they also retain high affinity for other serotonin,
adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor subtypes (see table45,46)
that can potentially mediate unwanted nausea, dysphoria,
asthenia and vascular effects. the  xxxd3263xxx  agents are a significant
progression since they target only the anti-migraine 5-ht1b and
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors and have reduced or eliminated unwanted
activity at most other monoamine receptor subtypes, thereby
improving therapeutic tolerability. the main limitations with the

ergotamine are nausea and vomiting that can exacerbate the
gastrointestinal symptoms commonly occurring in migraine.
these effects are reduced with dihydroergotamine but nausea is
still prominent. the 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor specificity
profile of the  xxxd3263xxx  agents currently in clinical use (sumatriptan,
 xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx , and naratriptan) and those in
development ( xxxd1976xxx , frovatriptan, almotriptan) is broadly
similar.46 the individual potencies of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists at 5ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors vary somewhat but this is usually
reflected in the clinical dose, supporting the idea that activity at
these receptors is primarily responsible for their therapeutic
effects. some differences between the  xxxd3263xxx  agents are also
apparent in ancillary activity at 5-ht1a,  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors46,47 and these may be involved, together with their
potency at 5-ht1b/1d receptors, in producing their individual
efficacy tolerability profiles.
anti-migraine

mechanisms of action for the

5-ht1b/1d

agonists

the figure shows diagrammatically the key sites of action for
the 5-ht1b/1d agonist  xxxd2022xxx  agents. first is a vascular
mechanism of action. the 5-ht1b/1d agonists selectively
constrict pain-producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels
by a direct action at 5-ht1b receptors on the vascular smooth
muscle.48 this effect reverses the vasodilatation and so reduces
trigeminal sensory nerve activation during migraine. the 5ht1b/1d agonists have good selectivity for the target blood
vessels over others (e.g. coronary) that could mediate adverse
effects (see below).
second is a neurogenic mechanism of action probably at  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.49,50 the 5-ht1b/1d agonists inhibit peripheral
trigeminal nerves and prevent neuropeptide release from the
activated peripheral terminals thereby removing the influence of
potent vasodilator peptides, particularly cgrp. this action
breaks the dilator cycle of events that could intensify pain
transmission and thereby promotes normalization of meningeal
blood vessel calibre.
third is a central mechanism of action probably at  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors within brain stem sensory trigeminal nuclei. brain
penetrant 5-ht1b/1d agonists inhibit neurotransmitter release from
the central terminals of activated trigeminal nerves.51,52 this action
interrupts pain transmission from cranial structures that would
otherwise pass through these central pain relay stations. preclinical studies show that this action appears to be specific for
trigeminal sensory divisions since 5-ht1b/1d agonists did not
reduce pain transmission in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn53 – an
observation that could explain why this class of compounds are
not general analgesics. more recent studies have revealed that
centrally acting 5-ht1b/1d agonists can also prevent dural
vasodilatation-evoked sensitization of caudal trigeminal
neurones,34 a phenomenon that could underlie their effectiveness
in reducing extracranial facial sensory disturbances during
migraine. as an aside, it is interesting to note that opiates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents also inhibit this sensitization
process and this may underlie their utility in migraine.
the relative importance of each of these mechanisms to
migraine  xxxd234xxx  has been a subject of much discussion
but it should be remembered that all could occur simultaneously.
it is therefore likely that they act in a complementary manner to

reduce the intense trigeminal input that occurs during a migraine
attack and so all contribute to the relief of migraine headache
pain and associated symptoms.
central actions of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists
there have been many debates on the importance of
differences in the lipophilicity of the  xxxd3263xxx  agents and the effect
that this has on oral absorption and brain penetration to the
central terminals of the trigeminal nerves. it is, however, worth
noting that all the 5-ht1b/1d agonists currently in clinical use are
very poorly brain penetrant when compared to agents like
diazepam. it has been argued that the speed of absorption and
access to the central sites could influence how fast the anti-

migraine clinical response is achieved, but it is also likely that
these factors will underlie the consistency of response and
therefore the drug’s overall effectiveness. there is one caveat to
this argument and that is that the brain penetrability of the  xxxd3263xxx 
agents have been determined experimentally in normal systems
where the blood-brain barrier is intact. it has been speculated, but
as yet unproven, that the blood-brain barrier may be open during
migraine attack. it is not known whether this occurs early or late
in an attack, but if it does, then clearly once it happens then all
compounds will have equal access to central sites and differences
between the various agents will disappear.
trigeminal afferent fibres project to the solitary tract nucleus
(nts) that is involved in the emetic reflex. it follows that
activation of this pathway during migraine may be the cause of

vasoconstriction through an action at 5-ht1b receptors on the vascular smooth muscle on meningeal

(cgrp) neuropeptide release through an action at prejunctional  xxxg1110xxx  receptors and 3) inhibition of
pain signal transmission within the brain stem trigeminal nucleus caudalis by preventing sensory
neurotransmitter release through an action at  xxxg1110xxx  receptors on central trigeminal nerve terminals.

migraine-associated nausea and vomiting. the 5-ht1b/1d
agonists have been shown to decrease nausea and vomiting and
this is likely to be an indirect effect of reducing trigeminal input
to the nts. fast drug penetration to central sites may bring
additional benefits for the  xxxd3263xxx  agents by giving access to  xxxg1110xxx  receptors in the solitary tract nucleus. it is therefore
noteworthy that the more brain penetrant 5-ht1b/1d agonists such
as  xxxd3135xxx  have some of the fastest effects against migraine
associated nausea.54 however, it is important to remember that
any benefit here could be offset by simultaneous activity at
central  xxxg1108xxx  sites, since these may be pro-nauseant.
the window between activity at  xxxg1110xxx  and 5-ht1a receptors
should therefore be maximized for the greatest anti-nausea
therapeutic gain. remember that recent preclinical studies55
suggest that agonist actions at central 5-ht1a receptors are
unlikely to contribute to the anti-nociceptive effects of the 5ht1b/1d agonists in trigeminal nuclei, in contrast to their
analgesic effects in spinal dorsal horn.
all tripan 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists are partial
agonists in human coronary arteries

the demonstration that 5-ht1b receptors are present in the
coronary arteries has given rise to concern over the potential for
adverse cardiac events with the ergots and the 5-ht1b/1d agonists
and has resulted in this class of drugs being contraindicated for
use in cardiovascular risk patients. adverse cardiac events are,
however, rare with all the 5-ht1b/1d agonists for two reasons.
first, the  xxxg1109xxx  reserve appears to be lower in the
coronary than the meningeal arteries.37 second, collectively all
the  xxxd3263xxx  5-ht1b/1d receptor selective agonists lack activity at
5-ht2a receptors46,47 which mediate most of the serotonergic
contraction in coronary vessels.56 taken together, these factors
confer craniovascular selectivity and cardiovascular safety for
the  xxxd3263xxx  class. at therapeutic concentrations there are no
marked differences between the  xxxd3263xxx  5-ht1b/1d selective
agonists in their contractile effects on human coronary arteries in
vitro.57 it is noteworthy that all the agents in the  xxxd3263xxx  class are
partial agonists in human coronary blood vessels in vitro57,58 as
their maximum effects are only a small fraction of the response
that can be evoked by the endogenous ligand serotonin. any
small differences between the responses to the various  xxxd3263xxx 
agents reflects their relative therapeutic potency and occur at
high concentrations that are supramaximal clinically and
therefore irrelevant to their therapeutic use against migraine.
there has been much discussion comparing the potential
cardiovascular safety of the various  xxxd3263xxx  compounds but the
arguments have often confused the safety and tolerability aspects
of their profiles. although there may be differences in the
tolerability profiles of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists, their potential
coronary safety profiles, as judged by pharmacological studies,
appear basically indistinguishable at this time.
novel approaches to acute migraine therapy
several recent drug development projects have been directed
towards blockade of the prejunctional effects i.e. release of
vasoactive peptides from activated trigeminal nerves, in the hope
of discovering acute anti-migraine agents that lack the

postjunctional vasoconstrictor effects of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists.
the  xxxg2240xxx   xxxg2242xxx  antagonists (ly303870,
rp100,893 gr205,171 and l-758,298) have failed in clinical
trials for acute migraine treatment and, although disappointing,
this finding is of interest with regard to the migraine
pathogenesis theory.59 experimental studies show that neurogenic extravasation/inflammation in the meninges is mediated by
neurokinins acting at nk1 receptors on the vascular endothelium.60 if this neurogenic extravasation occurs in migraine,
then it should have been completely blocked by these agents.
these data suggest that theories encompassing a role for ongoing
neurogenic dural extravasation in the headache pain phase of
migraine may have to be re-evaluated perhaps by examining the
activity of these agents as prophylactics. attention has now been
directed towards cgrp-induced meningeal vasodilatation as a
primary factor in producing migraine headache pain. increased
cgrp levels are perhaps one of the most reliable biochemical
markers in migraine and cluster headache and levels are
normalized concomitant with successful therapy.30 cgrp
antagonists have been shown experimentally to block meningeal
artery vasodilatation,61 suggesting that they may have  xxxd2022xxx  activity. non-peptide, cgrp antagonists are thought to
be in early clinical trials.
these antagonist approaches involve postjunctional blockade
of only one of the vasoactive substances that are released when
the trigeminal nerves are activated and, since many substances
are released, this strategy runs the risk that the other unblocked
components can still be active in the migraine process. a more
complete approach is to target prejunctional receptors on the
trigeminal nerve terminals to prevent the release of all vasoactive
substances at the same time. immunohistochemical and mrna
studies in human tissues have shown that it is the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor that is selectively located on the perivascular and central
terminals of trigeminal fibres.36 as a result it has been suggested
that a  xxxg1110xxx  selective agonist (effectively a sensory neuropeptide-release inhibitor) would be an attractive drug target since
it could potentially modulate transmission in the trigeminal
pathways but lack the 5-ht1b mediated vasoconstrictor activity
of current  xxxd3263xxx  anti-migraine agents. recent reports also
suggest that  xxxg1110xxx  receptors may modulate glutamatergic
transmission in the cerebral cortex in vitro62 and if this occurs in
the medullary dorsal horn, then it may be important in the central
anti-nociceptive actions of the 5-ht1b/1d agonists and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor selective agonists. the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor selective
agonist pnu 142,633 recently completed have entered phase ii
clinical trials and the data showed no evidence for acute efficacy
against migraine (r. mccall, personal communication, ibc
migraine conference philadelphia, may 1999). this finding was
disappointing since the rationale for the development of these
compounds appears sound. the reason for the failure is probably
that pnu 142,633 lacked sufficient efficacy at  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
(approximately one third the efficacy of sumatriptan at gorilla
cloned  xxxg1110xxx  receptors) and so was unable to shut down the
activated sensory nerves during migraine.63 it should be
remembered that the actions of the serotonin agonists to inhibit
neurotransmitter peptide release will be frequency dependent
such that the harder the nerves are firing the harder it is to inhibit
them. the  xxxg1110xxx  hypothesis thus remains untested and requires
re-evaluation with a compound with equally full efficacy at 5-

ht1d receptors as the currently used ‘ xxxd3263xxx ’ agents but lacking
activity at 5-ht1b receptors.
several of the current  xxxd3263xxx  agents have affinity for  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor sites and it has been proposed that this may contribute
to their anti-migraine efficacy.64 the development of  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor selective agonists has been underpinned by the same
lines of argument that were used for the  xxxg1110xxx  selective
strategy, since functional  xxxg1112xxx  receptors appear to be present
on peripheral trigeminal nerve terminals but absent from blood
vessels. the most advanced compound in this class is
ly334370.65 this compound has been recently withdrawn from
phase iii clinical trials, due to animal toxicity. preliminary phase
ii data on the efficacy of ly 334370 were recently presented at
the international headache society in barcelona and looked
promising with anti-migraine efficacy being demonstrated at 60
and 200 mg doses.66 it remains to be established whether this is
due to activity solely at  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, as the plasma
concentrations after 200 mg of ly334370 were quite high,67
raising the possibility that selectivity may have been
compromised. further studies with this class are clearly
warranted.
further clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of  xxxg1110xxx  or the  xxxg1112xxx  selective agonists as anti-migraine
agents will help settle the long-running debate on the relative
importance of vasoconstriction and trigeminal inhibition to the
anti-migraine effects of the “ xxxd3263xxx ” 5-ht1b/1d agonists. the
success of these strategies is likely to be critically dependent
upon adequate brain penetration to central trigeminal sites to
interrupt trigeminal pain signal transmission. it will be most
interesting if only one of these approaches shows anti-migraine
efficacy, since this will redefine the anti-migraine neuropharmacology of the trigeminovascular system and perhaps reveal other
neural components as novel therapeutic targets. future  xxxd2022xxx  strategies will undoubtedly examine the relationship of
p/q calcium ion channel mutations to brain dysfunction and
perhaps target this as a migraine prophylactic strategy. in
addition, the findings of ‘wind up’ in the trigeminal dorsal horn
that can be driven by meningeal dilation and inflammation
suggests that drugs that target this sensitization process may have
a role in anti-migraine therapy.
