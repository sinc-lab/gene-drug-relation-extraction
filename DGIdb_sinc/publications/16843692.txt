abstract
we have utilized caenorhabditis elegans to study human methylmalonic acidemia. using bioinformatics, a full complement of mammalian homologues for the conversion of propionyl-coa to succinyl-coa in the genome of c. elegans, including propionyl-coa carboxylase subunits a and b ( xxxg1677xxx -1,  xxxg1678xxx -1), methylmalonic acidemia cobalamin a complementation group ( xxxg1414xxx -1), co(i)balamin
adenosyltransferase ( xxxg1415xxx -1),  xxxg1416xxx  (cblc-1), methylmalonyl-coa epimerase (mce-1) and  xxxg1485xxx  (mmcm-1)
were identiwed. to verify predictions that the entire intracellular adenosylcobalamin metabolic pathway existed and was functional, the
kinetic properties of the c. elegans mmcm-1 were examined. rna interference against mmcm-1,  xxxg1415xxx -1,  xxxg1414xxx -1 in the presence of  xxxd3029xxx  revealed a chemical phenotype of increased methylmalonic acid; deletion mutants of mmcm-1,  xxxg1415xxx -1 and mce-1 displayed
reduced 1-[14c]-propionate incorporation into macromolecules. the mutants produced increased amounts of methylmalonic acid in the
culture medium, proving that a functional block in the pathway caused metabolite accumulation. lentiviral delivery of the c. elegans
mmcm-1 into wbroblasts derived from a patient with muto class methylmalonic acidemia could partially restore propionate xux. the
c. elegans mce-1 deletion mutant demonstrates for the wrst time that a lesion at the epimerase step of methylmalonyl-coa metabolism
can functionally impair xux through the  xxxg1485xxx  pathway and suggests that malfunction of mcee may cause methylmalonic acidemia in humans. the c. elegans system we describe represents the wrst lower metazoan model organism of mammalian propionate spectrum disorders and demonstrates that mass spectrometry can be employed to study a small molecule chemical phenotype in
c. elegans rnai and deletion mutants.

fig. 1. major pathway of the conversion of propionyl-coa into succinyl-coa in human cells. the biotin-dependent enzyme, propionyl-coa carboxylase
( xxxg1677xxx ,  xxxg1678xxx ) converts propionyl-coa into d-methylmalonyl-coa which is then racemized into l-methylmalonyl-coa and isomerized into succinylcoa, a kreb cycle intermediate. the l- xxxg1485xxx  (mut) reaction requires adenosylcobalamin. the class and genes associated with
methylmalonic acidemia are mut (mut),  xxxg1414xxx  ( xxxg1414xxx ), cblb ( xxxg1415xxx ), cbld variant 2 (unknown gene(s)), cblc (mmahc), cblf (unknown gene(s)).
question marks indicate unknown genes or poorly dewned cellular processes [6–10,19].

cofactor, accumulate methylmalonic acid in their tissues
and body xuids, and display secondary metabolic perturbations such as hyperglycinemia, hyperammonemia and intermittent hypoglycemia [1]. despite meticulous dietary
control, avected individuals exhibit extreme metabolic
instability and suver from severe complications, such as
developmental delay, renal disease, pancreatitis and metabolic infarction of the basal ganglia [2–5]. the pathophysiology of these processes and disease complications remain
poorly dewned.
a common feature of cell lines derived from mut,
 xxxg1414xxx ,  xxxg1415xxx  and cbld variant two dewcient patients is
diminished 1-[14c] propionate incorporation into macromolecules, an indirect assay of propionate xux through the
pathway depicted in fig. 1 [11,12].
the function of the methylmalonyl-coa epimerase or
racemase (mcee) in vivo is uncertain. one older report
proposed that patients who harbor mutations at this locus
are protected from developing methylmalonic acidemia
because a free methylmalonic acid shunt bypasses the epimerase reaction [13]. the striking conservation of the gene
throughout the phyla suggests that the gene product may
play a critical role in intermediary metabolism [14].

the methylmalonyl-coa epimerase (mce-1) of c. elegans has been studied [15]. a deletion mutant has no phenotype and exhibits relative resistance to oxidative stress.
while the gene product has been demonstrated to possess
methylmalonyl-coa epimerase activity in vitro, the biochemical phenotype of the mutant has not been evaluated.
speciwcally, whether it displays a functional impairment of
1-[14c]-propionate incorporation into macromolecules,
suggesting an active role in propionyl- and methylmalonylcoa metabolism, remains unknown. because there are no
dewnitive reports of methylmalonic acidemia patients with
mcee gene mutations, and no other animal models of
mcee dewciency exist, the role of the mcee gene in methylmalonyl-coa metabolism remains mysterious.
methylmalonic acidemia has been diycult to study in
model organisms. earlier evorts have used nutritional [16]
and cobalamin-analog treatments [17] to induce methylmalonic aciduria in rats. both of these treatments are artiwcial
and produce an incomplete block, especially in the case of
nutritional dewciency, causing combined  xxxg1479xxx  and  xxxg1485xxx  functional impairment. establishing tractable model organism systems to
study methylmalonic acidemia will be required to better

understand the symptoms and complications associated
with this group of disorders, develop new therapies and further dewne genes that may play a role in methylmalonylcoa and cobalamin metabolism. to date, knock-out
murine models of  xxxg1485xxx  have displayed a severe neonatal phenotype with uniform mortality
by 24–36 h of life [18,19]. organisms more amenable to
genetic manipulations such as yeast and drosophila do not
possess cobalamin-dependent metabolic enzymes or utilize
alternative pathways for propionyl-coa metabolism, such
as the methylcitrate cycle [20].
in the present report, we employed a combination of
informatic, genomic, biochemical, and metabolic analyses
to identify and characterize c. elegans genes predicted to
participate in methylmalonyl-coa metabolism. in addition
to providing direct biochemical evidence for  xxxg1485xxx  activity and adenosylcobalamin synthetic
capacity, we show that c. elegans can be used to dewne the
function of gene products previously suspected to participate in methylmalonyl-coa metabolism in man, particularly methylmalonyl-coa epimerase. we propose that c.
elegans may be used in genetic and genomic evorts to
identify genes that inxuence cobalamin and methylmalonyl-coa metabolism and demonstrate the utility of mass
spectrometry to study chemical phenotypes in c. elegans.
materials and methods
strains
c. elegans bristol n2, rb1434 mmcm-1(ok1637), rb1347 mmab1(ok1493), vc974  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1484) and rb512 mce-1(ok243) nematodes
were obtained from the caenorhabditis genetics center, university of
minnesota, minneapolis, mn, usa. deletion mutants rb1434, rb1347

and rb512 were generated by the oklahoma medical research foundation (omrf) knockout group, oklahoma city, ok, usa. deletion
mutant vc974 was isolated by the reverse genetics core facility at the
university of british columbia, vancouver, canada. nematodes were
grown at 20 °c on nematode growth media (ngm) plates using e. coli
strain op50 as a food source [21].

bioinformatics and sequence analysis
the blastp searches were performed against wormbase
(www.wormbase.org) using protein sequences from the ncbi
(www.ncbi.nih.gov) known to be involved in the conversion of propionylcoa to succinyl-coa in humans. reciprocal comparisons yielded identical results. the sequence accession numbers are displayed in table 1.

radioactive incorporation study
10–20 mg of c. elegans were incubated with 2 ci of [1–14c] sodium
propionate (perkinelmer, boston, ma) in 500 l of pbs with 50 g/ml of
kanamycin for 24 h. worms were examined for viability and re-suspended
in 500 l of 5% trichloroacetic acid (tca) solution, heated for 10 min at
85 °c and then placed on ice for 20 min. insoluble material was concentrated by centrifugation at 16,060£ g for 10 min. the pellet was rinsed
with 500 l of ice-cold 5% tca, re-suspended in 500 l of 1 n naoh and
heated at 85 °c for 15 min. protein concentration was determined using
the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad, hercules, ca). incorporation of
radioactive isotopes was measured using scintillation system ls6500
(beckman instruments, fullerton, ca).

isolation of cdna and c. elegans homologues
rna was isolated from a mixed worm population using rneasy mini
kit (qiagen inc., valencia, ca). superscript first-strand synthesis system
for rt-pcr (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) was used to generate single strand
cdna libraries. the cdnas for mmcm-1,  xxxg1414xxx -1,  xxxg1415xxx -1,  xxxg1677xxx -1,  xxxg1678xxx -1
and mce-1 were isolated by pcr using primers designed against sequences
obtained from wormbase. the forward and reverse primers were designed
with restriction enzyme sites for directional cloning; the forward primer
also contained a kozak consensus sequence for expression. pcr products

were cloned into pcr 2.1 topo vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using
ta cloning. clones were screened by pcr and positive clones were
sequenced.

isolation of break point sequences in c. elegans mutants
dna was isolated from c. elegans using dneasy tissue kit (qiagen
inc., valencia, ca). the genomic dna from each mutant underwent pcr
using the inner left and inner right primers designed by the c. elegans
knockout project at omrf for mutant screening. pcr products were
cloned into pcr 2.1 topo vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using ta
cloning. five clones from each mutant strain were then sequenced and
compared to the genomic dna sequence to determine the site of the deletion. the sequences have been deposited in wormbase under the respective gene entries.

rna interference
mmcm-1,  xxxg1414xxx -1,  xxxg1415xxx -1,  xxxg1677xxx -1,  xxxg1678xxx -1 and mce-1 were cloned into
the rnai vector ppd129.36 and transformed into e. coli strain op50 [22].
feeding rnai was performed as described [23]. the strains were grown
overnight from individual colonies in lb with 100 g/ml of ampicillin at
37 °c. one milliliter of overnight culture was then placed in 30 ml of lb
with 100 g/ml of ampicillin and grown to od of 0.4 absorbance units at
595 nm. the culture was induced with 0.4 mm iptg for an additional 4 h.
bacteria were concentrated by centrifugation and plated on 100 mm ngm
agar plate with 12.5 g/ml of tetracycline, 100 g/ml of ampicillin and
1 mm iptg. strains were grown overnight at room temperature. the following day two 100 mm plates per strain were seeded with c. elegans eggs
prepared using standard methods. nematodes were grown at 20 °c until
plates were cleared.

loading studies
nematodes were washed from plates (two plates per strain) after feeding rnai with 6 ml phosphate buvered saline (pbs) and puriwed via a
sucrose gradient (30% sucrose in ultra-pure water). the animals were
placed in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes and suspended with 5 mm of sodium propionate (sigma) in 500 l pbs with 50 g/ml kanamycin incubated at 20 °c
for 48 h. the worms were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed
for gc/ms analysis. metabolite levels were normalized to protein concentration of the pellet or wet weight.

gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms)
methylmalonic acid concentrations were determined using capillary
gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy with stable isotopic internal calibration as described [24]. in some experiments, organic acids were puriwed
after perchloric acid precipitation of macromolecules and anion exchange
column chromatography [25].

mitochondrial preparations
isolation of intact mitochondria from c. elegans was performed as previously described [26], with the modiwcations detailed below, to obtain
well-functioning mitochondria. a total of 1 to 3 g of freshly washed adult
worms were washed twice with 10 ml msm-e [150 ml msm (40.08 g mannitol, 23.96 g sucrose, 1.047 g mops, 3 ml 0.1 m edta, ph 7.4, per liter)]
and re-suspended by centrifugation (300£ g, 10 min, 4 °c). a glass potter/
elvehjem tissue grinder with a texon (dupont, wilmington, de) pestle
(wheaton, millville, nj) was then used for initial rupture: 3 slow strokes
at 400 rpm. proteinase subtilisin a (sigma, mo) was added to the homogenate (5 mg per gram of worms) and stirred for 10 min on ice. immediately
afterward, the slurry was homogenized in the same apparatus as before,
with 10 slow strokes at 400 rpm. an equal volume of msm-eb (50 ml
msm-e + 0.2 g defatted bovine  xxxg124xxx ) was added and the
homogenate was centrifuged (300£ g, 10 min, 4 °c). the supernatant was

67

pipetted into a fresh centrifuge tube, while the pellet was re-extracted in
the same manner as described above. centrifugation (7000£ g, 10 min,
4 °c) of the supernatants from both the original and re-extracted homogenizations yielded mitochondrial pellets, which were re-suspended in 10 ml
msm-e, centrifuged (7000£g, 10 min, 4 °c), and then re-suspended in
10 ml msm, and centrifuged as before. the wnal mitochondrial pellet was
re-suspended in approximately 100 l of msm (per »2 g of fresh-washed
adult worm pellet initially used). total protein concentration was determined by the lowry assay with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0–100 g) used as
standard [27]. two microliters of protease inhibitor cocktail (p8340,
sigma, mo) were added per 100 l mitochondrial preparation. oxidative
phosphorylation assays on the puriwed mitochondrial preparations veriwed functional activity. isolated mitochondria were frozen at ¡80 °c prior
to enzymatic analyses.

expression of c. elegans mmcm-1 in yeast
a sequence veriwed, full-length c. elegans mmcm-1 cdna was cloned
into the pyes-dest52 gateway vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and
transformed into strain invsc1. the vector carries a ura selection
marker and uses the gal4 promoter to drive expression of the insert.
expression was induced after growth in galactose containing media and
conwrmed by comparison to a lacz expression control and enzymatic
assay for the  xxxg1485xxx  gene product. lysates were
prepared by homogenization with acid-washed glass beads and subsequent centrifugation and were used for enzyme kinetic assays as
described [23].

enzymatic assays and kinetics
 xxxg1485xxx  activity was assayed using a radioactive
succinate thiokinase-linked assay as described [28]. the assay mixture contained: 95 l of d/l-[methyl-14c]methylmalonyl-coa (150 ci per mmol),
1 mm in 3 mm hcl], 45 l of tris-hcl buver, 0.5 m, ph 9, 45 l mgcl2,
0.1 m, 45 l gdp, 20 mm, 50 l adenosylcobalamin (variable concentration), 20 l of succinate-coa ligase (succinyl thiokinase) prepared at
5 units/ml, yeast cell lysate or mitochondrial preparation extract (variable
volume) and water to bring the volume to 450 l. the tubes were incubated
in a 30 °c dry block for 30 min (in dark). the reactions were stopped by
acidiwcation and extracted with ethylacetate. an aliquot was then counted
by liquid scintillography to determine activity. the wild-type murine
enzyme, expressed in an identical fashion in yeast, served as a control for
the kinetic studies. assays were performed in triplicate for all concentration points and the kinetics repeated twice. kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear regression modeling of the kinetic data and regression
statistics were calculated as previously described [29].

lentiviral correction
the c. elegans mmcm-1 cdna was cloned into plenti6/v5-dest
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using gateway lr clonase enzyme mix (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). a replication-incompetent, hiv-based lentivirus
was generated by using the virapower lentiviral expression system
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the viral construct has the mmcm-1 gene
driven by the cmv promoter; the backbone also has a blasticidin cassette
driven by the e7 promoter. a control virus expressing egfp was also prepared and used in parallel for correction experiments. human muto wbroblast cell lines were transduced with virus containing either the c. elegans
mmcm-1 or egfp. the transduced cells were selected and expanded in
dmem with 5% fetal bovine serum containing 2.5 g/ml blasticidin prior
to 1-[14c]-propionate propionate incorporation assays.

unique worm homologues for each gene product (table 1).
the homologues have been named in accordance with c.
elegans nomenclature (http://biosci.umn.edu/cgc/nomenclature/nomenguid.htm). the high degree of similarity suggests that these proteins are functionally related. mut,
 xxxg1678xxx ,  xxxg1677xxx ,  xxxg1414xxx , mcee,  xxxg1415xxx  and mmahc
have similarities of 97.8, 95.3, 94.6, 82.5, 79.6 53.7% and 52%
with the worm homologues (table 1). the functional
domains of the predicted protein products were also highly
conserved between species. this would be expected for
mut,  xxxg1677xxx  and  xxxg1678xxx  because of the high degree of similarity seen at the amino acid level.  xxxg1414xxx , mcee and
 xxxg1415xxx , which had a lower degree of similarity, also had
conservation of all known domains between species. the
c. elegans  xxxg1415xxx -1 gene product only has a similarity of
53.7%, but the adenosylcobalamin transferase domain of
this protein displays 97.6% similarity with the same domain
in the human enzyme. such protein domain conservation
may be more indicative of proteins with similar function
than a simple residue alignment. the high degree of similarity and domain conservation between the human enzymes
involved in propionate metabolism and c. elegans proteins
would seem to be unlikely, unless enzymatic function was
conserved. as a secondary conwrmation that cobalamin
metabolic pathways might be intact in c. elegans, we
performed similar searches to identify genes that might
participate in methylcobalamin metabolism. single homologues of  xxxg1479xxx  (5-methyltetrahydrofolate–
homocysteine methyltransferase) and  xxxg1479xxx 
reductase (msr) appear to be present with a similar degree
of protein and domain conservation; wp: ce01609 is 80%
similar to human  xxxg1479xxx  (blast e-value d 0.0)
and wp: ce00868 is 50% similar to  xxxg1479xxx 

reductase (blast e-value d 1.5e-75). however, homologues
of  xxxg2255xxx , transcobalamin ii, intrinsic factor, and
the e. coli periplasmic binding protein btuf were not
detected. queries with  xxxg557xxx  and  xxxg1342xxx  produced a nonspeciwc alignment to a number of c. elegans genes in the
egf-like domains of these genes.
we wrst attempted to verify the existence of functional
c. elegans homologues of propionate metabolism genes,
which were identiwed using bioinformatics, using an rnai
approach. rnai directed against mmcm-1,  xxxg1414xxx -1 and
 xxxg1415xxx -1 cause the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in
the supernatant at 2-3 times the levels seen in the wild-type
nematodes (fig. 2). interference against  xxxg1678xxx -1 was used as
a negative control and produced no increase in mma versus the wild-type strain. methylmalonic acid levels did not
diver from controls, probably because  xxxg1678xxx -1 rnai blocks
the conversion of propionyl-coa to d-methylmalonylcoa. bacterial rnai feeding strains were loaded with propionate in the same manner as nematodes and did not
exhibit levels of methylmalonic acid above wild-type nematodes (data not shown) demonstrating that the bacteria
were not producing methylmalonic acid in our experiment.
attempts were made to clone  xxxg1677xxx -1 and mce-1 into rnai
vectors, but in bacteria, these vectors were unstable and
toxic, respectively.
three c. elegans deletion mutants suspected to remove
portions of genes identiwed in our bioinformatic analysis,
mmcm-1 and  xxxg1415xxx -1, were studied and the deletion breakpoints delineated when not known. the c. elegans mmcm-1
deletion mutant, strain rb1434, has a portion of exon 2
and all of exon 3 deleted. exon 3 appears to encode a portion of the highly conserved  xxxd1739xxx  binding pocket
and would be predicted to produce a non-functional

by nematode wet weight (mg), detected in supernatant after rnai against indicated genes in the presence of 5 mm  xxxd3029xxx  in pbs. mmcm-1 (p
value vs wt d 0.004),  xxxg1414xxx -1 (p value vs wt d 0.005), and  xxxg1415xxx -1 (p value vs wt d 0.33, ns) rnai showed increases in methylmalonic acid concentrations relative to wild-type. propionyl-coa carboxylase subunit b ( xxxg1678xxx -1) rnai creates a block prior to the formation of methylmalonyl-coa, therefore methylmalonic acid concentrations are not increased (p value d 0.211, ns vs wild-type). values are from two independent experiments, averaged,
with ranges indicated by error bars.

protein. rt-pcr performed on mmcm-1 deletion mutants
did not detect mrna (data not shown). based on the rtpcr results, which showed no mmcm-1 rna transcript,
and the neonatal lethal phenotype observed in mice with a
similar deletion, the c. elegans mmcm-1 mutant would be
predicted to have no enzymatic activity. strain rb 1347
harbors a deletion of the wrst exon of the putative  xxxg1415xxx -1
gene. the second exon of  xxxg1415xxx -1 begins with a start codon
and expression studies to characterize the rna made by
this mutant were not pursued. the deletion of  xxxg1415xxx -1 harbored in strain vc974 has been described by the generating
laboratory and appears to remove the c-terminal exon that
has high homology with the adenosyltransferase domain.
strain rb512 has previously been shown to harbor a deletion of the mce-1 gene [15]. propionate incorporation and
metabolic analysis of the mce-1 mutant have not been previously described.
in order to verify the phenotypes observed in our rnai
treated animals, we conducted 1-[14c]-propionate propionate
incorporation studies on the c. elegans deletion mutants.
1-[14c]-propionate incorporation studies, routinely used to
study human mutant cell lines [11,12], were adapted to detect
blocks in propionate metabolism of c. elegans as described
above. radioactive incorporation studies with the n2 strain
showed that c. elegans incorporates 1-[14c]-propionate from
propionate into protein in amounts similar to those seen in
human cells [11 § 4 nmols/mg/18 h] [30] (fig. 3). furthermore, a robust stimulation of incorporation was observed
when  xxxd2300xxx  ( xxxd2300xxx ) was added to the
medium in excess. c. elegans mmcm-1,  xxxg1415xxx -1 and mce-1
deletion mutants all exhibited a diminished ability to incorporate 1-[14c]-propionate into protein as compared to
wild-type nematodes (fig. 3). the n-terminal deletion
mutant  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1493) displayed a less severe block than

69

the c-terminal mutant  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1484), possibly because the
c-terminal deletion removes a domain critical to  xxxg1415xxx -1
function as the sequence analysis would suggest. the mce-1,
mmcm-1, and  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1484) mutant animals exhibited
a > 80% decrease in the ability to incorporate propionate relative to wild-type animal. a similar decrease in 1-[14c]-propionate xux can been seen in human muto wbroblasts when
compared to wild-type controls.
to assess the biochemical response to precursor loading,
we incubated the n2, mmcm-1,  xxxg1415xxx -1 (ok1484, ok1493)
and mce-1 mutant strains with  xxxd3029xxx  and measured methylmalonic acid in the supernatant (fig. 4). preliminary studies suggested methylmalonic acid was easily
detected in the supernatant, which ranged in concentration
from 0.5–10 m and was present at higher concentrations
than in whole cell worm extracts. while both the wild-type
and mmcm-1 animals produce an increased amount of
methylmalonic acid after loading, the mmcm-1 mutant
accumulated 17 times more methylmalonic acid than the
wild-type strain (fig. 4). the  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1484, ok1493) and
mce-1 mutant strains show approximately a two-fold
increase in the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in comparison to wild-type animals. kanamycin treatment provided a bactericidal evect on the residual feeding strain to
assure bacteria had no evect on metabolite measurements;
growth assays of the bacteria that were incubated for 24 h
in kanamycin showed uniform and complete sensitivity and
failed to incorporate c14 propionate or produce metabolites. furthermore, metabolic measurements of the supernatant from the wash steps of puriwcation, before and after
 xxxd3029xxx  loading indicating that the bacteria were not
producing mma (data not shown).
attempts to demonstrate  xxxg1485xxx 
enzyme activity in crude worm extracts were unsuccessful.

we therefore sought to examine isolated mitochondrial
preparations to determine whether detectable activity
might be present. we found that puriwed mitochondria harbored signiwcant  xxxg1485xxx  activity and
the activity was destroyed by heat inactivation (table 2a).
a yeast over-expression strain was created using a fulllength sequence veriwed c. elegans methylmalonyl-coa
mutase and was employed in comparison with wild-type c.
elegans mitochondrial preparations to examine apparent
kinetic constants (table 2b). the initial reaction velocities
of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions were graphed against
substrate concentrations in michaelis–menton plots. the
kinetic parameters and lineweaver–burke plots were determined from these data by curve wtting using non-linear
regression [29].
the apparent km for adenosylcobalamin for the mouse
enzyme, the c. elegans enzyme from isolated mitochondria,
and the c. elegans enzyme over-expressed in the yeast system, were all within the 10¡8 m range and were similar to

that reported for human enzyme [31]. the c. elegans
mutase enzyme in the mitochondrial preparations appears
to exist predominantly as an apoenzyme and, in the presence of adenosylcobalamin, exhibits a vmax of 6.42 mol/
min/mg. this is comparable to the vmax observed for ascaris lumbricoides of (4.73 mol/min/mg) [32] but much less
than the mouse enzyme.
the c. elegans  xxxg1485xxx  cdna was
introduced into a human muto cell line by lentiviral delivery.
blasticidin was used to select for transduced cells; an egfp
control was conwrmed by xorescence and western analysis
using antibodies against egfp (data not presented). cell
lines that had undergone transduction plus selection were
studied by c14 macromolecule incorporation. the expression of c. elegans mutase signiwcantly increased the mutasedependent label movement into macromolecules in mutant
cell lines to 30% of wild-type but failed to reach 100% normalized xux as assessed by this assay (fig. 5). the c. elegans
mmcm-1 corrected cell line also exhibited increased methyl-

discussion
in these studies, we have used genetic, genomic and biochemical methods to establish the existence of an adenosylcobalamin-dependent  xxxg1485xxx  in c.
elegans. the conservation and extreme similarity between the
vertebrate and predicted worm enzymes suggests that the
entire propionyl-coa to succinyl-coa pathway depicted in
fig. 1 is functionally intact in c. elegans. our wndings demonstrate that native c. elegans mitochondria do harbor an
active mutase that is predominantly apoenzyme in constitution. the observed kinetic constants of the nematode  xxxg1485xxx  show high aynity adenosylcobalamin
binding, as seen in vertebrate mutases and a vmax that
approximates what has been seen in other organisms. the
signiwcant fraction of apoenzyme versus holoenzyme
observed in our mitochondrial preparations suggests a modulation of or dependence upon cobalamin in the environment
or the food source. the accentuation of activity in whole
worm incorporation experiments after incubation in the
presence of  xxxd2300xxx  further demonstrates the existence of adenosylcobalamin synthetic capacity in vivo and
suggests that propionate metabolism can be greatly increased
when the environment is cobalamin-replete. the mechanisms
for extra-cellular cobalamin uptake and transport are
unclear from a bioinformatics analysis as the extracellular
proteins known to participate in these processes do not
appear to have c. elegans homologues. however, the synthesis of methylcobalamin seems likely, given the presence of
gene products that are highly similar to human vitamin
b12—dependent  xxxg1479xxx  and  xxxg1479xxx  reductase. future studies, perhaps similar to the ones

described herein, will be required to examine the functionality and nature of these enzymatic pathways.
a number of other lines of experimental evidence indicate the presence of an adenosylcobalamin metabolic pathway in c. elegans when grown under laboratory conditions.
the mmcm-1 and  xxxg1415xxx -1 deletion mutants have diminished 1-[14c]-propionate incorporation compared to wildtype animals, indicating that downstream movement of the
label from 1-[14c]-propionate into protein is impaired, presumably at the step of conversion of methylmalonyl-coa
to succinyl-coa. these metabolic blocks are consistent
with a functional defect in adenosylcobalamin synthesis in
the case of the  xxxg1415xxx -1 mutants, and impairment in apoenzyme synthesis in the case of the mmcm-1 deletion mutant.
the deletion in the  xxxg1415xxx -1(ok1493) mutant removes the
wrst exon, which may contain an inverted repeat. the possibility of an internal translation product from the deleted
allele with residual activity is feasible given the fact that the
second exon begins with a start codon. the other mutants
all display severe blocks and appear to have similar activity
in this assay, consistent with the proposed roles for the gene
products in methylmalonyl-coa metabolism.
the mmcm-1 mutant exhibits increased methylmalonic acid production, which is accentuated in the face of
precursor loading. the mutant consistently produced
greater than tenfold more methylmalonic acid than the
n2 strain (p value d 0.02), but exhibits variability
between experiments, which explains the larger standard
deviation observed in this strain versus n2. the mce-1
and  xxxg1415xxx -1 deletion mutant strains appear to have
decreased viability in propionate-containing medium but
consistently produce more methylmalonic acid than the
n2 strain. preliminary observations indicate diminished
survival by these strains under propionate loading, which
likely explains the milder increases in metabolite production by these mutants, especially since the mutants show

72

display a severe impairment in the c14 incorporation
assays. the results show that the c. elegans system might
be used to examine inducers and regulators of the  xxxg1485xxx  reaction by virtue of metabolite
production.
a surprising wnding was that the mce-1 mutant had a
severe block in c14 propionate incorporation. although
mutations in mut,  xxxg1414xxx  and  xxxg1415xxx  have been shown
to cause methylmalonic acidemia in humans, mcee dewciency has not yet been proven to cause methylmalonic acidemia [33]. montgomery et al. [13] administered a number
of methylmalonic acid isotopomers to vitamin b12 dewcient
rats and analyzed methylmalonic acid output by mass spectrometry. they noted a rearrangement of label in the urine
after peritoneal injection of methylmalonic acid into the
cobalamin-dewcient rats, which was not observed in control
animals. to explain the label distribution observed, they
posited the existence of a “free” methylmalonic acid shunt,
which was able to bypass the epimerase reaction and proposed that this mechanism protected patients with mcee
lesions from developing methylmalonic acidemia. the
results we have observed are not entirely consistent with the
existence of a bypass in c. elegans because the mce-1 deletion mutant exhibits a block as severe as the c. elegans
mcm mutant and produces increased methylmalonic acid.
if a free-shunt was functionally operational over the physiological range of methylmalonyl-coa concentrations,
selective pressure on the mcee gene might be lessened or
removed and conservation between species would not be
predicted. mutations of mcee may result in either a mild
or an embryonic lethal phenotype in humans, which could
go undetected. if a free mma metabolic shunt exists in c.
elegans, it appears to be incapable of handling the normal
xux through this pathway as assessed in the assays we have
performed. isotopomer studies using the mutant strains
may be useful to further examine this issue. the results
observed with the c. elegans mce-1 deletion mutant suggest
that humans with functional methylmalonyl-coa epimerase lesions will have methylmalonic acidemia and cell lines
from these patients will exhibit a block in 1-[14c]-propionate incorporation. the identiwcation and careful clinical
characterization of patients harboring suspected mcee
mutations will be required to resolve this issue.
we also demonstrated that the c. elegans mutase can
partially correct wbroblasts derived from muto human
patients. the level of correction was signiwcantly increased
over the mutant background and gfp in all instances. the
corrected human cell line displayed similar intermediate
correction and could be stimulated by  xxxd2300xxx 
addition to the media. the reason for a partial correction of
the human cell line is uncertain, but may relate to the specialized mitochondrial importation sequences found at the
n-terminal end of the c. elegans gene. other mitochondrial
enzymes have been shown to have a limited cross-species
correction for this reason, even when the species barrier is
relatively close, such as between human and mouse [34]. if
c. elegans mitochondrial localized genes are to be used for

cross-species correction of mutant cell lines, for example, to
identify unknown cobalamin disease genes or disease gene
modiwers, future studies will be required to determine optimum expression parameters.
we have documented that this model organism can be
used to study the pathophysiology of human methylmalonic
acidemia by demonstrating that the mce-1 mutant has a
functional dewcit in 1-[14c]-propionate incorporation and
predict, based on these results, that the human homolog will
cause methylmalonic acidemia in humans when mutated.
the metabolic lesions generate a chemical phenotype that
might be useful if rnai or targeted deletion mutant analysis could be coupled to metabolic prowling. such an analysis
could identify mutants that produced increased amounts of
methylmalonic acid and/or reduced 1-[14c]-propionate
incorporation, and might identify new genes involved in
intracellular cobalamin and propionyl-coa metabolism,
some of which may have human homologues that are
mutated in patients with propionic acidemia, methylmalonic
acidemia and/or homocysteinemia. the experiments presented here also demonstrate that sensitive mass spectrometry measurements can be performed on small numbers of
animals to determine chemical phenotypes and suggest that
metabolic prowling will be useful to study c. elegans rnai
and deletion mutants in other pathways.
