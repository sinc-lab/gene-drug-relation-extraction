summary
rats and humans manifest elevated response thresholds to aversive stimuli during gestation and
parturition. this pregnancy-associated antinociception is mediated, in part, by a spinal cord dynorphin/k antinociceptive system. simulating the maternal pregnancy blood concentration profile (in non-pregnant animals) of
17-/3-estradiol ( xxxd2037xxx ) and progesterone (p) produces an opioid antinociception which closely approximates that of
actual pregnancy. the current study was initiated in order to determine whether sex steroid-induced antinociception
involves a spinal cord k-opiate receptor-coupled system (as does the antinociception of actual gestation). additionally, sex steroid modulation of the intrathecal (i.t.) antinociceptive effectiveness of a k agonist was investigated. the
opioid antinociception associated with simulating the pregnancy blood concentration profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p (hormonesimulated pregnancy, hsp) is significantly antagonized by i.t. administration of nor-binaltorphimine, an antagonist
highly specific for the k-opiate receptor. this indicates that exposure (of non-pregnant animals) to the pregnancy
blood profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p activates a spinal cord k-opiate receptor analgesic system, as occurs during actual
gestation. furthermore, during hsp, antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h (k-selective) is significantly
enhanced ( ~ 40%). this effect is abolished in animals treated concomitantly with steroid hormones and systemic
naltrexone or i.t. nor-binaltorphimine. in contrast to the effects of steroid treatment on antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h, l~loalteration in antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. sufentanil was observed on day 19 of
hsp over all doses tested (0.1-1 nmol). thus, during hsp (and actual gestation), a less robust constituent of
intrinsic opioid pain-attenuating systems in the spinal cord is recruited.
pf to mediate, at least in part, the maternal antinociception of gestation, pf, positive modulation of the spinal
cord k analgesic system occurs post-synaptically. this laboratory previously reported that simulating the pregnancy
blood concentration profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p also positively modulates spinal dynorphin content and the processing of its
precursor, suggesting a presynaptic loci of action. thus, female rats possess a spinal dynorphin/k analgesic system
that can be positively modulated, pre-synaptically as well as post-synaptically, by circulating sex steroids.

introduction

in rats, as well as in humans, pregnancy and parturition are associated with elevated maternal pain thresholds (gintzler 1980; gintzler et al. 1983; baron and

et al. 1987; sander et al. 1988, 1989). this phenomenon
is manifest in response to somatic as well as visceral
noxious stimuli. these include, in rats, electric foot
shock (gintzler 1980), thermal stimuli applied to the
tail (toniolo et al. 1987; kristal et al. 1990), colorectal
distention (iwasaki et al. 1991) and, in women, pressure applied to the dominant forearm (cogan and
spinnato 1986) or finger (whipple et al. 1990)) and
radiant heat (rust et al. 1983) as noxious stimuli. in
rats, elevated response thresholds to aversive stimuli

methods
experiments employed female sprague-dawley rats (250-300 g,
charles river) which were maintained in an approved controlled
environment with lights on for 14 h/day (05:00-19:00 h). food and
water were available ad libitum. all experimental procedures were
reviewed by the institutional animal care and use committee.
animals were ovariectomized at the beginning of the study and were
allowed to recover for 1 week prior to experimental use.
reflexive jumping in response to electric foot shock was used as
an index of pain threshold as described previously (gintzler 1980).
briefly, jump thresholds were defined in milliamperes as the lower of
two consecutive intensities that elicits the simultaneous withdrawal
of both front paws from a charged grid. each trial began by applying
 xxxd3426xxx  msec foot shock at a current intensity of 0.1 ma. subsequent
shocks were increased in 0.5-ma steps,  xxxd1891xxx -sec intervals, until 6-7
trials were completed. jump thresholds were determined in experimental and control rats between 10:00 and 13:00 h. after a consistent baseline was obtained (over 5-8 days), animals were ovariec-

tomized, and baseline jump thresholds were re-established. previous
studies using this testing paradigm demonstrated that repeated determination of jump thresholds does not alter jump thresholds and
confound data interpretation (gintzler 1980).
 xxxd2037xxx  and p were administered via the subcutaneous implantation
of silastic tubing filled with either a solution of  xxxd2037xxx  (in sesame oil) or
crystalline p, as previously described (bridges 1984; dawson-basoa
and gintzler 1993). pregnancy-like levels of  xxxd2037xxx  and p were simulated
in non-pregnant, ovariectomized rats, by changing the concentration
of e e in the tubing (10 mm tubing/100 g body weight) and by
altering the number of 45 mm p implants on days 4, 15 and 19
(bridges 1984; dawson-basoa and gintzler 1993). (see bridges (1984)
and bridges and ronsheim (1987) for details of implantation procedure and comparison with steroid plasma levels of actual gestation.)
as a control, the same experimental design was employed using
implants that contained sesame oil (vehicle for  xxxd2037xxx ) and empty
silastic tubing (as a vehicle control for p).
on day 4 of hsp, a permanent indwelling catheter was inserted
into the lumbar subarachnoid space essentially as described elsewhere (yaksh and rudy 1976; roberts et al. 1985; sander et al.
1989). briefly, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40
mg/kg, i.p., anpro pharmaceutical) following pre-treatment with
atropine (0.85 mg/kg, i.p., anpro pharmaceutical). a saline-filled
catheter (pe-10, clay-adams) was inserted through an incision in the
atlanto-occipital membrane and slowly introduced into the spinal
subarachnoid space (7.5 cm). a loose knot was made in the exposed
end and fixed with silastic medical adhesive. the cephalic portion of
the catheter was externalized through the skin above the skull in the
parietal area where it was relatively inaccessible to the paws. all
animals were allowed to recover for a minimum of 2 weeks before
experimental use and appeared to be free of infection upon gross
inspection. those exhibiting motor impairment (see below) were
eliminated from the study.
to investigate the potential contribution of k receptors to the
antinociception of hsp, animals were injected intrathecally with
nor-bni, a k-selective opiate receptor antagonist (portoghese et al.
1987). hsp animals were fitted with intrathecal (i.t.) cannulae on day
4 of the study. on day 19 of hsp, baseline jump thresholds were
determined, 30 min after which animals were restrained in plastic
decapicones (braintree scientific, braintree, ma). i.t. injections (87
nmol nor-bni in 5 p.l of saline) (levine et al. 1994) the same dose of
nor-bni that antagonized the antinociception of actual gestation
(sander et al. 1988)) were administered over a 60 see period to the
lumbar subarachnoid space (via the indwelling cannula). all cannulae were flushed with 10 o.l of saline to insure complete drug
delivery. jump thresholds were re-determined 5, 10, 30, and 50 min
following injection. the effect of i.t. nor-bni in ovariectomized
animals treated with hormone vehicle (instead of  xxxd2037xxx  or p) was
determined in an analogous fashion. since this laboratory has previously demonstrated that the i.t. administration of 15 /xl of saline
(same volume used in the present study) does not affect jump
thresholds (sander and gintzler 1987), this control was not repeated.
mean jump thresholds obtained at various time points following the
i.t. application of nor-bni were compared with the baseline jump
thresholds obtained in the same animal 30 min prior to treatment.
the data for the experimental and control groups were analyzed
using a 2-tailed student's t test.
the above protocol was repeated for assessment of the contribution of spinal /~ receptors to the antinociception of hsp. the #
antagonist  xxxd1793xxx -cys-tyr-o-trp-arg-thr-pen-thr-nh2 (ctap, 34
nmol) (kramer et al. 1993) was applied to the i.t. space 20, 35, 50 and
65 min after which jump thresholds were re-determined. to demonstrate abolishment of i.t. sufentanil antinociception by ctap, initial
jump thresholds were obtained after which ctap (34 nmol) was
administered intrathecally. after a 5 min interval, i.t. sufentanil was
administered (0.6 or 1.2 nmol). jump thresholds were re-determined
15 min thereafter.

171
in order to determine whether the antinociceptive efficacy of
intrathecally administered r ~nd /z opioids is positively modulated
during hsp, dose-response curves to i.t. u50,488h (~-selective;
upjohn, kalamazoo, mi) and sufentanil (g-selective; janssen pharmaceutical) were generated daring this condition. for experiments
involving u50,488h, animals ~ere ovariectomized and divided into 3
treatment groups. group 1 received the entire regimen of ez and p,
whereas group 2 received the same regimen of hormone treatment
while maintained on chronic systemic naltrexone (2 naltrexone pellets, 30 mg each, encased in nylon mesh and implanted subcutaneously at the time of ovariectomy). these pellets were replaced on
days 1 and 4, the days on which steroid doses 1 and 2, respectively,
were implanted (see yoburn et al. 1986) for pharmacokinetics of
naltrexone pellets). animals in group 3 did not receive any hormone
treatment (or naltrexone) subsequent to ovariectomy. animals comprising all groups were fitted with i.t. cannulae (see above) on day 4
of hormone treatment. on day 19 of hsp, the time at which
significant increases in pain threshold were previously observed
(dawson-basoa and gintzler 1993), dose responsiveness to i.t.
u50,488h or sufentanil was determined. data were analyzed using
analysis of covariance (ancova) and linear trend analysis.
baseline analgesic threshold levels (5-8 determinations) were
determined for all groups the using the flinch-jump procedure (see
above), after which opioid ago;aists were administered intrathecally.
following an interval appropriate for either u50,488h or sufentanil
(20 and 15 min, respectively) pain thresholds were re-determined and

compared with jump thresholds obtained from the same animal prior
to analgesic administration. for u50,488h, cumulative dose responsiveness to increasing i.t. concentrations (10, 20, 60, 90 and 120 nmol)
(pelissier et ai. 1990; sullivan and dickenson 1991) were determined
20 min following i.t. administration (maximum antinociception was
observed 15 min following injection). increasing doses were applied
immediately following each jump threshold determination. allowing
3 min for jump threshold assessment at each dose, the fourth
concentration was administered approximately 90 min following the
initial injection. in a preliminary study, this laboratory determined
that the antinociception produced by i.t. u50,488h had not diminished 60 min following application. furthermore, 90 min following
i.t. administration, of u50,488h, > 90% of the suppression of c
fiber-evoked responses were still observed (sullivan and dickenson
1991). the decrement of analgesic effects of the initial injection at
the time (113 min) of the fifth and last dose determination, (approximately 45%) (sullivan and dickenson 1991) should not confound the assessment of the antinociception resulting from the last
i.t. application since the initial dose represents less than 10% of the
final cumulative i.t. concentration.
in order to determine the effect of nor-bni on the antinociception produced by i.t. u50,488h, jump thresholds of additional groups
of hormone-treated and control animals were determined immediately after which nor-bni was administered to the lumbar i.t. space.
following a 5 min interval, jump thresholds were reassessed and
u50,488h was injected intrathecally. jump thresholds were re-de5e

fig. i. effect of a r-selective opiate receptor antagonist on the antinociception of hsp. on day 19 of hsp, ovariectomized rats were injected
with either 34 nmol of ctap (bzr a) or 87 nmol of nor-bni (bars c1-c3). thereafter, jump thresholds were determined at 20, 35, 50 and 65 min
(for ctap) or 5, 30, and 50 min for nor-bni). since ctap was without effect at all time points, only the 5 min point is depicted. controls
consisted of ovariectomized rats that did not receive hormone replacement. these were also injected with nor-bni (87 nmol) after which jump
thresholds were determined at tile intervals described above for the experimental group. since nor-bni was without effect on pain thresholds of
untreated controls at all time intervals tested (5, 30 and 50 min), data is depicted for only the 50 min time point (bar b). in all cases, mean jump
thresholds obtained at various in,lervals following the experimental procedure were compared with baseline jump thresholds obtained in the same
animal 30 min prior to experimental injections and are plotted as mean + sem% of pre-injection jump thresholds. initial jump thresholds for
steroid-treated and control groups were 0.28 and 0.25 ma, respectively. since jump thresholds in control animals, assessed at the same 5, 30 and
50 min, did not change, repeated testing does not confound data interpretation. inset depicts the inability of 87 nmol of nor-bni to attenuate
antinociceptive responses to either i.t. 6 nmol (a) or 1.2 nmol sufentanil (b). * p < 0.05.

termined 20 rain following i.t. agonist administration. following a 20
rain rest interval, this cycle was repeated for each dose of u50,488h
tested (10, 20, 60, 90 and 120 nmol). this procedure was used,
instead of cumulative dose responsiveness, in order to allow for
determination of agonist-induced antinociception within the time
frame of maximum r-receptor antagonism.
for sufentanil, animals were divided into 2 groups. group 1
received the entire regimen of  xxxd2037xxx  and p. group 2 did not receive any
hormone treatment but were maintained on silastic tubing filled
with sesame oil (vehicle for  xxxd2037xxx ) and empty silastic tubing (vehicle for
p). since naltrexone sensitivity of the antinociceptive effects of i.t.
sufentanil has been well documented (yaksh et al. 1986), a naltrexone group was not included in this study. dose responsiveness to
sufentanil was not determined in cumulative fashion since the duration of antinociception following its i.t. application was much shorter
than that of u50,488h (10-15 rain). instead, analgesic responsiveness to increasing doses of sufentanil (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0 nmol) was
determined 15 rain following i.t. application, at 20 rain intervals,
when the antinociception resulting from the previous injection was
no longer manifest. doses higher than 1.0 nmol were not employed
since the i.t. application of 3 nmol sufentanii resulted in hindlimb
paralysis (unpublished observations). the antinociception resulting
from a single injection of the highest dose (1.5 nmol; n = 4) was
indistinguishable from that resulting from the i.t. administration of
the same concentration after dosing with increasing concentrations.
thus, desensitization resulting from exposure to multiple doses of
sufentanil was not a confounding factor.
in a separate group of animals, motoric integrity was assessed 20
rain following administration of the highest i.t. dose of u50,488h
using both the righting reflex and the incline plane test. in the
righting reflex test, each rat was placed upside down and its latency
to righting was measured. any rat failing to right within < 1 sec was
considered to be motorically compromised. for the incline plane

test, rats were placed on wire-mesh screens set at a 90° angle and
their ability to maintain position assessed. a cut-off score of 60 see
was used to indicate motorically intact animals.

results
fig. 1 depicts the effects of the i.t. administration of
nor-bni on pain thresholds during day 19 of hsp rats.
on day 19 of hormone treatment, nor-bni administration (87 nmol) (levine et al. 1994) produced a highly
significant reduction in jump threshold (fs,30 = 193.24,
p < 0.01). at both the 5 and 30 min time points, the
mean maximum jump threshold reduction was approximately 38%. fifty minutes following i.t. application,
jump thresholds began to return to control levels but
were still significantly less than those observed prior to
nor-bni treatment. in contrast to what was observed
in hormone-treated animals, the same concentration of
nor-bni administered i.t. to vehicle-treated rats was
without effect on jump thresholds at all time points
e x a m i n e d (f6,36 -- 3.92, p = 0.3).
in order to revalidate, in the rat, the opiate receptor-type selectivity of nor-bni following i.t. application, the same i.t. concentration used above (87 nmol)
was tested for effects on antinociceptive responses to
i.t. sufentanil (0.6 or 1.2 nmol), nor-bni failed to
produce any attenuation of the sufentanil-induced ele-

fig. 2. effect of the pregnancy blood profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p on analgesic effectiveness of i.t. u50,488h. reflexive jumping in response to electric
foot shock was used as an indicator of pain thresholds. antinociceptive actions of i.t. u50,488h were determined in untreated ovariectomized
rats, ovariectomized rats treated with the pregnancy blood profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p (hsp) or ovariectomized rats receiving the same regimen of
hormone treatment while maintained on systemic naltrexone. responsiveness to u50,488h was determined 20 rain following i.t. administration.
increasing doses were applied immediately following each jump threshold determination. data is presented as mean + sem pain threshold at
each dose. baseline jump thresholds for hormone-treated, control and hormone-treated plus naltrexone were 0.33, 0.29 and 0.27 ma,
respectively. inset depicts dose-response relationship to i.t. sufentanil in control or hsp rats.

in the absence and presence of nor-bni, respectively;
see inset to fig. 1). furthermore, i.t. application of the
/z-selective antagonist (.'tap (kramer et al. 1993), at a
concentration (34 nmol) that abolishes antinociceptive
responses to i.t. sufentanil (0.6 or 1.2 nmol, n - - 3 for
each concentration) had no effect on nociceptive
thresholds of hsp at any of the time points examined
(20, 35, 50 and 65 min following i.t. application; f4,20 =
0.95, p > 0.4; see fig. 1, bar a).
the effect of the pregnancy profile of circulating  xxxd2037xxx 
and p on spinal k-opioj[d antinociception is illustrated
in fig. 2. an ancova revealed a significant group
effect (fl,15 = 103.05, p < 0.01), dose effect (fl,16 =
239.59, p < 0.01) and interaction between group and
dose (]74,13 = 4.43, plt;0.05). as a result of simulating
the pregnancy blood concentration profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p,
analgesic responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h is significantly enhanced ( ~ 40%). this effect is abolished in
animals treated concomitantly with steroid hormones
and subcutaneous naltrexone pellet implants (fi,15 =
332.0, p < 0.001). moreover, analgesic responsiveness
to i.t. u50,488h in rats exposed to pregnancy levels of
 xxxd2037xxx  and p as well as naltrexone is also significantly
different from that obse:rved in control animals (fl15 =
468.6, p < 0.001).
consonant with these observations is the finding
that antinociceptive responses to i.t. u50,488h, in control or steroid-treated animals (10-120 nmol), were
abolished by i.t. administration of nor-bni (87 nmol).
in the presence of nor-bni, neither a dose nor group
effect was observed (/74,56= 1.17 and fi,ls = 0.11, respectively, p > 0.05; n = 8 for each group).
in order to more definitively implicate spinal ropiate receptors in the antinocicpetive actions of i.t.
u50,488h, dose responsiveness of steroid-treated and
control animals to this agonist was determined in the
presence of i.t. nor-bni (87 nmoles).
since intrathecally applied x opioids have been
shown to produce limb paralysis, integrity of motoric
function was assessed using the incline plane test (90 °)
and the righting reflex. even at the highest dose of
u50,488h employed (120 nmol), neither test revealed
any impairment of motor function (n = 10 for each
test).
the effect of simulating the pregnancy blood profile
of circulating  xxxd2037xxx  and p on spinal/z-opioid antinociception was also assessed. an ancova indicated a significant dose effect (f4,56 = 86.37, p < 0.05) but no
group effect (fl13 = 0.01), or group by dose effect
(f4,56 = 0.83; p > 0.05 for both). in contrast to the
effects of steroid treatment on analgesic responsiveness
to i.t. u50,488h, no alteration in antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. sufentanil was observed on day 19

of hsp over all doses tested (0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5
nmol).

discussion

this report demonstrates that the opioid antinociception associated with simulating the maternal pregnancy blood concentration profile of e z and p can be
significantly antagonized by the i.t. administration of
nor-bni, an antagonist highly specific for the x type of
opiate receptor (portoghese et al. 1987). based on
previous observations in pregnant animals (sander et
al. 1988), it is highly unlikely that the ability of i.t.
nor-bni to lower jump thresholds of hsp is due to an
effect produced at some site distal to the spinal cord
subsequent to diffusion into and transport via the
blood. however, despite the application of us0,488h
into the lumbar i.t. space, antinociception was manifested in the front paws. this, most likely, results from
rostral diffusion within the spinal cord to thoracic and
cervical regions. however, interaction with supraspinal
k receptors cannot be unequivocally eliminated at this
time. this notwithstanding, given that elevated jump
thresholds of actual pregnancy can be attenuated with
i.t. (sander et al. 1989) but not i.c.v, administration of
naltrexone (unpublished observations) a spinal loci of
action in the present paradigm is favored. thus, the
ability of i.t. nor-bni to attenuate jump thresholds of
steroid-treated animals indicates that the opioid
antinociception of hsp is mediated, at least in part, by
a spinal cord (presumably lumbar) opioid analgesic
system.
despite the reported receptor-type selectivity of
nor-bni (portoghese et al. 1987; takemori et al. 1988;
tortella et al. 1994), interaction of this r-selective
antagonist with spinal cord /z receptors has been reported (guirimand et al. 1994). in the current experimental paradigm, this potential interaction is not a
confounding factor since the same concentration of
nor-bni that lowered nociceptive thresholds of hsp
did not attenuate the spinal antinociception produced
by i.t. sufentanil (/z-selective; inset to fig. 1). moreover, i.t. ctap, at concentrations that abolished
antinociceptive responses to i.t. sufentanil, did not
attenuate the elevated jump thresholds of hsp (fig. 1,
bar a).
this study did not definitively eliminate the possibility that, during hsp, the ability of nor-bni to lower
jump thresholds was mediated via an interaction with
spinal 8 receptors. however, the absence of reports
that the pharmacological effects of nor-bni are mediated via this receptor type makes this possibility unlikely. thus, the most plausable interpretation of the
data presented in fig. 1 is that exposure (of non-preg-

174

nant animals) to the pregnancy maternal blood concentration profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p activates a spinal cord
k-opiate receptor analgesic system, as occurs during
actual gestation (sander et al. 1988).
this laboratory previously reported that the pregnancy blood profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p produced an opioidmediated elevation in nociceptive thresholds (gintzler
and bohan 1990; dawson-basoa and gintzler 1993).
however, in the current study, the initial jump thresholds of hormone-treated (day 19) and control animals
were not different. this (unexpected) similarity of jump
thresholds could have resulted from initial jump
thresholds of the hormone-treated groups being lower
than those of the corresponding control groups. as a
consequence, any hormone-induced elevation in jump
thresholds would have been masked, thereby resulting
in the coincidence of jump thresholds of hormonetreated (day 19) and control groups. since, in the
current study, jump thresholds in the hormone-treated
group were not determined prior to steroid administration, this conjecture must remain as such. therefore,
differences in baseline jump thresholds between hormone-treated and control groups could have obscured
any steroid-induced increases. this also aplies to the
animal groups used to assess the effect of steroid
treatment on antinociceptive responses to u50,488h.
however, it should be noted that in the study assessing
the effect of steroid treatment on antinociceptive responses to u50,488h, jump thresholds on day 19 of
hsp in the presence of naltrexone are significantly
lower than those of the hsp group (without naltrexone). this indicates that in the steroid-treated group,
opioid tone contributes to overall nociceptive thresholds, an effect not observed in untreated, non-pregnant
animals and consistent with the previous demonstration of an opioid antinociception associated with hsp
(gintzler and bohan 1990; dawson-basoa and gintzler
1993). furthermore, in the study assessing the effects
of ctap on steroid-mediated antinociception, jump
thresholds were determined prior to steroid dosing and
were found to be significantly lower (t = -9.53, p <
0.001; 37%) than those observed on day 19 of hsp.
the ability of spinal k-opiate receptors to mediate
sex steroid-induced antinociception is consonant with
their localization within the spinal cord. k-opiate receptors are present, in high density, in the lumbosacral
area of both rats (gouarderes et al. 1985) and humans
(gouarderes et al. 1986). in rat spinal cord, k-binding
sites are discretely distributed in superficial layers of
the dorsal horn and in lamina x, around the central
canal (gouarderes et al. 1985), regions involved in the
processing of nociceptive stimuli. of particular relevance to the present study, k sites are more densely
present in the lumbo-sacral segment of the spinal cord
than in cervical or thoracic areas (gouarderes et al.
1985). thus, there is a cephalic-caudal gradient of k

receptors along the spinal cord which parallels the
distribution of dynorphin (1-17) in this tissue (medina
et al. 1993b). additionally, although the k1 subtype of
receptor (through which u50,488h acts) is most prominent in rat cervical and thoracic areas, they are present
and quantifiable in rat lumbar spinal cord (besse et al.
1992). in the cervical region (and presumably lumbar)
kl-opiate receptor sites decrease in response to dorsal
rhizotomy (besse et al. 1990) demonstrating their relationship to primary sensory afferents.
the localization of k receptors parallels the distribution of dynorphin in lamina ii and other regions of
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and are consistent
with reports that i.t. dynorphin (piercey et al. 1982;
przewlocki et al. 1983; han and xie 1984; herman and
goldstein 1984; guirimand et al. 1994) or u50,488h
(pelissier et al. 1990) can induce antinociception. additionally, it should be noted that analgesia elicited by
electroacupuncture stimulation can be significantly attenuated by the i.t. injection of igg against dynorphin
both in rats and rabbits (han and xie 1984).
the antinociception that results from activation of
spinal cord k-opiate receptors is stimulus-specific. for
example, i.t. u50,488h is considerably more effective
in attenuating nociceptive responses to visceral chemical (schmauss and yaksh 1984) or mechanical (pressure) (schmauss 1987) than to cutaneous thermal stimuli (schmauss and yaksh 1984). this is of particular
relevance to the present study since visceral chemical
and pressure modalities of pain are more closely related to the physiological state of pregnancy (in which
a spinal cord dynorphin/k antinociceptive system is
activated (sander et al. 1988, 1989) and, presumably,
hsp than is cutaneous thermal. thus, the magnitude
of antinociception resulting from steroid administration was probably under represented in the present
study. however, activation of a nor-bni-sensitive spinal
analgesic system in response to somatic aversive stimuli
has been demonstrated (watkins et al. 1992; menendez et al. 1993).
numerous studies have demonstrated that actions of
dynorphin in the spinal cord are multifaceted. the
antinociceptive effects ascribed to spinal dynorphin
notwithstanding, hyperalgesia and neurotoxicity have
also been associated with the i.t. administration of this
opioid peptide. for example, a spinal cord dynorphin
system is activated in response to peripheral inflammation (hollt et al. 1987; ruda et al. 1988; stiller et al.
1993) and this has been implicated in the expansion of
nociceptive fields associated with this type of peripheral inflammation (dubnar and ruda 1992). this mode
of action, however, is not, necessarily incompatible
with the present formulation of spinal antinociceptive
actions of dynorphin since the physiological state associated with each is quite distinct. furthermore, the
neuronal sites of action within the cord that mediate

175

antinociception or nociceptive field expansion have not
been defined and could also be disparate.
with respect to the n eurotoxicity associated with the
exogenous administration of dynorphin (1-17), it should
be noted that given the very small i.t. lumbar space in
the rat ( ~ 50/zl, dr. joseph fenstermacher, personal
communication), the concentration of intrathecally administered dynorphin that has been associated with
neurotoxicity ( ~ 20 nmol) (martinez-arizala et al. 1988;
faden 1990) approaches the/zm range. this is approximately 1000 times the affinity constant of dynorphin
for the k receptor. while such extracellular concentrations might be achieved in response to severe spinal
cord trauma and thus mediate the accompanying neurotoxicity, these observations do not preclude other
transmitter functions for dynorphin when released endogenously in physiological concentrations. indeed, the
neurotoxic effects and motoric impairment produced
by of i.t. dynorphin (1-17) notwithstanding, this peptide has also been reported to produce antinociception
following i.t. application using the tail pressure nociceptive response (schmauss 1987). since tail flick responses were unaffected in these animals, it is extremely unlikely that the increase in the tail pressure
reflex latency reflects compromised motoric function
(schmauss 1987).
changes in the activity of opioid systems can be due
to pre- or post-synaptic modulation, i.e., fluctuations in
the rate of release (or degradation) of opioids a n d / o r
alterations in the various parameters of binding to
opiate receptors (affinity, coupling, density, etc.). the
present results demonstrate that during hsp, the maximum analgesic responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h is increased by approximately 40%. this augmented response is attenuated by concomitant treatment with
naltrexone (see fig. 2) indicating that the  xxxd2037xxx  / p induced enhanced analgesiic responsiveness to u50,488h
is mediated via (k) opiate receptors. thus, post-synaptic components of a spinal opioid analgesic system
can be modulated by circulating female sex steroids.
this laboratory has previously demonstrated that
simulation of the pregnancy blood concentration profile of e2 and p can positively modulate lumbar dynorphin a(1-17) content. the magnitude and temporal
pattern of this increase in dynorphin a(1-17) closely
parallels that observed during actual gestation. additionally, late pregnancy is also associated with significantly enhanced processing of dynorphin precursor
peptides throughout the spinal cord. this illustrates
that circulating sex steroids can also influence pre-synaptic parameters of spinal cord opioid function. thus,
a progressive increase in the circulating levels of  xxxd2037xxx 
and p, such as that which occurs during actual pregnancy, modulates pre-synaptically as well as post-synaptically a spinal dynorphin/k-opioid analgesic system.
supraspinal opioid function has been shown to be

sensitive to peripheral sex steroids. ovariectomized
rats given estradiol and progesterone, approximating a
blood concentration achieved during pregnancy, manifested a 52% increase in opiate receptor binding density and the concentration of/3-endorphin in the preoptic area (bridges and ronsheim 1987). additionally,
acutely administered estrogen positively regulates
proenkephalin mrna levels in the ventrolateral aspect
of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (romano et
al. 1988). treatment with progesterone attenuates the
rapid decline in hypothalamic levels of proenkephalin
mrna that occurs following the cessation of estrogen
administration (romano et al. 1988). the demonstration of such effects of estrogen and progesterone,
however, have been for the most part, confined to
regions of the hypothalamus. this report, in combination with the previously reported biochemical assessment of spinal dynorphin content during hsp (medina
et al. 1993a), represent the first demonstrations of
female sex steroid responsiveness of a spinal cord
opioid analgesic system(s).
in the present study, the steroid-mediated augmented antinociceptive effects of i.t. u50,488h were
abolished by systemic naltrexone indicating mediation
by opiate receptors. additionally, since antinociceptive
responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h in rats exposed to
pregnancy levels of  xxxd2037xxx  and p as well as systemic
naltrexone is also significantly different from that observed in control (untreated) animals, it is suggested
that antinociceptive responses to i.t. u50,488h, observed in the absence of hormone treatment are also
mediated via opiate receptors. these conclusions are
underscored by the ability of i.t. nor-bni to abolish
antinociceptive effects of i.t. u50,488h in control or
steroid-treated animals. furthermore, these actions of
nor-bni, coupled with its inability to attenuate
antinociceptive responses to i.t. sufentanil (inset to fig.
1), indicate that u50,488h is indeed acting via its
preferred receptor type. it is interesting to note that
the steroid-induced augmented antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. u50,488h was not accompanied by a
horizontal shift in its dose-response curve. thus, the
pregnancy profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p enhances the antinociceptive efficacy of i.t. u50,488h.
simulating the pregnancy blood concentration profile of  xxxd2037xxx  and p failed to alter antinociceptive responsiveness to i.t. sufentanil, a g-selective opioid (inset to
fig. 2). this is consistent with the finding that i.t.
administration of ctap, a highly selective and potent
/z-selective antagonist (kramer et al. 1993), neither
altered jump thresholds of actual pregnancy (gestational day 20; n = 6; unpublished observations) nor
those of hsp (fig. 1, bar a). thus, the potent/z-opiate
receptor analgesic system in the spinal cord appears
not to be sensitive to the pregnancy blood profile of  xxxd2037xxx 
and p and not to participate in the antinociception

176

associated with gestation. instead, during the condition
of pregnancy, a less robust constituent of intrinsic
opioid pain-attenuating systems in the spinal cord is
recruited to mediate, at least in part, the maternal
antinociception of gestation. moreover, the absence of
an effect of  xxxd2037xxx  and p on antinociceptive responses that
generalizes to i.t./z opioids indicates that trivial explanations such as a change in paw resistance does not
confound current conclusions.
in summary, the spinal cord of female rats contains
a dynorphin/k analgesic system that is sensitive to
circulating  xxxd2037xxx  and p. simulating the pregnancy blood
concentration profile of these steroids produces an
antinociception that is mediated, at least in part, via
spinal k-opiate receptors. female sex steroid modulation of the spinal cord i< analgesic system occurs on
pre-synaptic and post-synaptic levels. the marked parallels between the antinociception produced by female
sex steroid treatment and that of actual gestation indicate that the profile of change in circulating  xxxd2037xxx  and p
are parameters of the pregnant condition critical to its
associated opioid antinociception.
