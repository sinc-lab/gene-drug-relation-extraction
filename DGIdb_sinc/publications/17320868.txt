abstract
estrogen involvement in neuroprotection is now widely accepted, although the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of estrogen action
in neuroprotection remain unclear. this study examines estrogenic effects in a mixed population of cells in attempts to identify the contributing
cells that result in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. utilizing primary mesencephalic neurons, we found expression of both  xxxg730xxx 
alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) and  xxxg731xxx  ( xxxg731xxx ) with a predominance of  xxxg730xxx  on both dopamine neurons and astrocytes. we also found that 17betaestradiol protects dopamine neurons from injury induced by the complex i inhibitor, 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (mpp+) in a time- and erdependent manner. at least 4 h of estrogen pre-treatment was required to elicit protection, an effect that was blocked by the er antagonist, ici
182,780. moreover,  xxxg730xxx  mediated the protection afforded by estrogen since only the  xxxg730xxx  agonist, hpte, but not the  xxxg731xxx  agonist, dpn,
protected against dopamine cell loss. since glial cells were shown to express significant levels of  xxxg730xxx , we investigated a possible indirect
mechanism of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection through glial cell interaction. removal of glial cells from the cultures by application of the
mitotic inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, significantly reduced the neuroprotective effects of estrogen. these data indicate that neuroprotection
provided by estrogen against mpp+ toxicity is mediated by  xxxg730xxx  and involves an interplay among at least two cell types.

introduction
estrogen is known predominantly as a reproductive hormone, but its biological functions are widespread, encompassing actions such as differentiation, neuronal survival and
maturation (belcher and zsarnovszky, 2001; beyer et al., 2003).
although the neuroprotective actions of estrogen have been
extensively studied, a single mechanistic pathway has not been
identified, suggesting multiple possible mechanisms. this may
be because estrogen actions are cell-type-specific and depend
on the  xxxg730xxx  (er) subtype targeted as well as the
contributing adjacent cell types. as a result, estrogen-mediated
neuroprotection responses may be different depending on the
brain region affected. the present study examines estrogen's

effects in a mixed population of mesencephalic cells, containing
both neurons and glia in attempts to identify the er and cells
that elicit estrogen-mediated neuroprotection of midbrain
dopamine (da) neurons.
the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is a target of estrogen and evidence suggests that estrogen serves as a neuroprotectant in many disorders originating in the brain, including
the nigrostriatal neurodegeneration observed in parkinson's
disease (pd) (kuppers et al., 2000). such estrogen-mediated
neuroprotection has been observed using neurotoxic agents
such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp)
in vivo or its active metabolite, mpp+ in vitro, which
selectively damages dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra similar to the cell loss observed in pd (d'astous et al.,
2006; sawada et al., 2002). furthermore, as the brain ages and
estrogen levels decline, the risk for acquiring neurodegenerative disease increases, which further substantiates the importance of understanding estrogen's role in neuronal survival
(dluzen, 2000).

the role of estrogen in regulating the differentiation and
maturation of developing neurons has been characterized in
dopaminergic neurons of the developing midbrain (hutchison
and beyer, 1994; hutchison et al., 1997; kuppers et al., 2001).
differentiation of embryonic midbrain dopaminergic neurons
involves rapid estrogen signaling via calcium and activation of
the camp/pka/pcreb signaling cascade concomitant with an
up-regulation of bdnf (beyer and karolczak, 2000; ivanova et
al., 2001).
like estrogen, neurotrophic factors such as gdnf, bdnf,
ngf and  xxxg1614xxx  play a critical role in the survival and
differentiation of embryonic da neurons (hyman et al., 1994;
lin et al., 1993; skaper et al., 1993). initially thought to be
prevalent only in the developing brain, these same neurotrophic
factors are found in substantial levels in the adult brain (buck et
al., 1987; ho et al., 1995; maisonpierre et al., 1990), where they
play a significant role in both the protection and the
regeneration of neurons in response to injury (tomac et al.,
1995). therefore, factors that regulate the production and/or
release of trophic factors may have implications in the treatment
of neurodegenerative disorders.
glial cells are an important source of trophic factors and proinflammatory proteins, which are involved in the protection and
repair of damaged neurons. in response to estrogen, microglial
inflammatory mediators such as tnf-alpha are down-regulated in
astrocytes while trophic factors such as igf-1 and  xxxg2269xxx  are
up-regulated (liao et al., 2002; duenas et al., 1994). similarly,
such responses in vitro have been observed in in vivo models of
neurodegeneration. for example, quesada and micevych
(2004) reported a decrease in da cell loss by 17beta-estradiol
and igf-1 following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) lesioning
of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and that the igf-1
receptor antagonist jb-1 blocked these effects. together these
studies demonstrate that estrogen positively regulates trophic
factor signaling. since glia and neurons are responsive to
estrogen, it is possible that the neuroprotective mechanism of
estrogen requires signal cross-talk between the two cell types.
although there is substantial evidence demonstrating estrogen-mediated neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons, the
majority of these studies have been conducted in homogeneous
cell lines that are only representative of a neuronal population.
this becomes a problem when trying to identify estrogens
mechanism of action because these neurons do not fully express
the phenotypic properties of true neurons and are not cultured
amongst other physiological cell-types, such as glia. we utilize
an in vitro model of neurodegeneration in which mouse primary
mesencephalic cultures, containing both neurons and glia, are
pretreated with 17beta-estradiol and estrogenic compounds
followed by exposure to the dopaminergic neurotoxin, mpp+.
materials and methods
primary mesencephalic cultures
animal procedures were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee of the university of texas
health science center at san antonio and were conducted in

accordance with policies for the ethical treatment of animals
established by the national institutes of health.
progenitor cells were harvested from e13.5 (vaginal plug,
day 0.5) embryos from time-mated c57bl/6 mice (harlan
sprague-dawley, indianapolis, in). pregnant mice were killed
by co2 asphyxiation and e13.5 embryos were collected in 1×
hbss containing  xxxd2193xxx . the ventral mesencephalon was
dissected away from underlying tissue at the mesencephalic
flexure as previously described by studer et al. (1997) and
single cells were mechanically dissociated from pooled
mesencephalic tissue with fire-polished pasteur pipettes. cells
were plated directly onto glass coverslips (12 mm diameter,
fisher) in 24-well plates (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa).
coverslips were pretreated by washing in acid followed by heat
sterilization and subsequent coating with 500 mug/ml poly-lornithine for 1 h at 37 °c in 8% co2 followed by 10 mug/ml
fibronectin overnight at 4 °c. cells were grown in chemically
defined media (dm) at a density of 160,000 cells/cm2 with
 xxxg787xxx  (20 ng/ml; upsate biotechnology, lake placid, ny) and
incubated at 37 °c in 5% co2. basal medium comprised of
mem/ham's f-12 (gibco/invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) 1/1 (v/v)
supplemented with 25 mm nahco3, 25 mm, glucose, 15 mm
hepes and 2 mm glutamine. defined medium was prepared by
supplementing basal medium with 100 mug/ml human apotransferin, 60 mum putrescine, 5 mug/ml insulin, 30 nm sodium
selenite and 20 nm progesterone. following this protocol, th+
neurons represent 4–5% of the total number of neurons in
culture, as determined by th (1:1000; novus biologicals,
littleton, co) vs. neun (1:1000; chemicon, temecula, ca)
immunocytochemistry. for neuron-enriched cultures, mesencephalic cells prepared as above were treated with the mitotic
inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (dfur) at a concentration
of 15 mug/ml beginning on day 2 for 48 h (day of plating was
considered as day 0). cultures were rinsed and replaced with
fresh serum-free defined media prior to 17beta-estradiol treatments. neuronal enrichment was verified by immunocytochemistry using  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) (1:200;
boehringer mannheim corp., indianapolis, in), mac-1
(1:500; serotec, raleigh, nc) and th (1:1000; novus
biologicals, littleton, co). dfur treatment reduced glial
expression by > 95% whereas the number of th-expressing
neurons remained the same between dfur- and non-dfurtreated coverslips. all chemicals were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo) unless otherwise noted.
preparation of astroglial monolayers
glial cultures were prepared from the midbrain of postnatal
day 0–3 c57bl/6 mice (harlan sprague-dawley, indianapolis,
in) pups. a modified protocol from ho and blum (1997) was
used for the preparation of astroglial cultures. briefly, the
meninges were removed from dissected midbrain and tissues
were trypsinized (2.5 mg/ml) and treated with dnase i (10 mug/
ml) for 15 min at 37 °c. dulbecco's minimal essential medium
(dmem) (gibco/invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) was added and the tissue
suspension was centrifuged. following resuspension in dmem

m. bains et al. / experimental neurology 204 (2007) 767–776

plus 10% fbs, the cell suspension was filtered through a 70mum nylon mesh screen (falcon, franklin lakes, nj). cells
were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish and
grown in 5% co2 at 37 °c. confluent monolayers were
shaken at 37 °c for 2 h at 250 rpm to remove microglia. the
purity of the cells was assessed using antibodies directed
against mac-1 and gfap for identification of microglia and
astrocytes, respectively.
chemicals and treatments
17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-estradiol, 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionitrile (dpn) (tocris, ellisville, mo), and 2,2-bis(phydroxyphenyl)-1,1-trichloroethane (hpte) (cedra corp.,
austin, tx) were added to the mesencephalic cultures 24 h,
or at indicated times prior to mpp+ treatment and were then
removed by replacing cultures with fresh media containing
mpp+ for 24 h. 1 mum  xxxd2165xxx  (ici) (tocris, ellisville, mo)
was applied to cultures at least 1 h before addition of 17betaestradiol. mpp+ (0.1 m), 17beta-estradiol (1 mm), and dfur
(25 mg/ml) were dissolved in water, 17alpha-estradiol, dpn, hpte
and  xxxd2165xxx  were dissolved in ethanol at 1 mm before use
and diluted in defined media to the final concentrations. control
cultures received the appropriate amount of vehicle, which did
not alter dopamine neuronal survival as measured by th
immunocytochemistry. all chemicals were purchased from
sigma (st. louis, mo) unless otherwise stated.
cell fractionation
subcellular fractionation analysis was performed as previously described (jeske et al., 2004). following homogenization by 20 strokes in a potter–elvehjem homogenizer in a
hypotonic homogenization buffer (25 mm hepes, 25 mm
sucrose, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 50 mm nacl, ph 7.2), the samples
were centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 min to remove nuclei (n) from
the homogenate. the resulting post-nuclear supernatant was
centrifuged at 15,000×g for 30 min to separate cytosolic
proteins (c) from cell membrane proteins (m). equal proportion
aliquots from each crude fraction were combined with 2× sds–
page sample buffer, resolved by sds–page and visualized
by western blot analysis.
sds–page and western blotting
protein samples were boiled in sds–page loading buffer,
separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide sodium  xxxd1781xxx 
(sds) gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf)
membranes (millipore, billerica, ma). membranes were
incubated in 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h to
block non-specific antibody binding followed by overnight
incubation at 4 °c with the appropriate primary antibody ( xxxg730xxx :
santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca;  xxxg731xxx : zymed
laboratories, san francisco, ca; flotillin-1: bd transduction
laboratories, lexington, ky). membranes were washed and
incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to
horseradish peroxidase (amersham biosciences, buckingshire,

769

england) for 1 h at 25 °c and developed using a chemiluminescence kit (amersham biosciences; buckingshire, england).
immunocytochemistry
fluorescent immunocytochemistry
mesencephalic cultures were grown on poly  xxxd2793xxx  and
fibronectin-coated coverslips for 5 days in defined media.
coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs),
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °c.
following fixation, coverslips were rinsed twice with pbs, and
incubated with 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% triton x-100 in
pbs for 30 min at 25 °c. coverslips were then incubated with a
combination of anti-sera directed specifically towards  xxxg730xxx 
(1:500; mc20 santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca),
 xxxg731xxx  (1:500; zymed laboratories, san francisco, ca), th
(1:500; novus biologicals, littleton, co) and gfap (1:500;
chemicon, temecula, ca), overnight at 4 °c. coverslips were
then rinsed three times and incubated with appropriate
fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (jackson immunoresearch, west grove, pa) for 1 h at 25 °c. following three
rinses with pbs, nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′diamidino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride (dapi; 100 ng/ml)
for 5 min. coverslips were mounted onto glass microscope
slides with permafluor aqueous mounting medium (thermo/
shandon immunon, pittsburgh, pa) and dried overnight. to
confirm that double labeling was not due to bleed through of
fluorescent dyes, coverslips were also incubated with only one
of the primary antibodies. for double-label immunofluorescence, stained cells were viewed on a zeiss axioplan 2
microscope and images captured using axiovision imaging
software. confocal analysis of coverslips was carried out in
conjunction with uthscsa imaging core services, san
antonio, tx, usa.

at specified times, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and washed in pbs. endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched by a 10 min incubation in 0.3% h2o2. nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation for 30 min
in pbs with 5% goat serum (vector laboratories, burlingame,
ca) containing 0.01% triton x-100. cells were incubated with
primary antibody (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine
hydroxylase (th); pel-freeze, rogers, ar) in blocking solution
overnight at 4 °c. cells were washed three times with pbs and
then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit igg (1:500; vector
laboratories, burlingame, ca) for 2 h at room temperature.
cells were washed and incubated with extravidin (1:1000) for
1 h at room temperature. after further washes, staining was
visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (0.05% in
0.003% h2o2). coverslips were then washed and mounted on
glass microscope slides in aqueous mounting medium (thermo/
shandon immunon, pittsburgh, pa). stained cells were viewed
on a zeiss axioplan 2 microscope and images captured using
axiovision imaging software (carl zeiss inc., göttingen,

receptor expression in mouse mesencephalic cultures
to verify and characterize the expression of estrogen
receptors (er) in mouse mesencephalic cultures, subcellular
fractionation of cell homogenates was performed to determine
the relative distribution of the er subtypes among the nuclear,
cytosol and membrane compartments (fig. 1a). there was
expression of both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  in the cytosolic and

mesencephalic glial cultures (c–f). cultures were stained with  xxxg730xxx  (green) or  xxxg731xxx  (red) and the nuclei were counterstained with dapi (blue).

membrane fractions, with a predominance of  xxxg731xxx  in the latter
and low expression of either receptor in the nuclear fraction
(fig. 1a). in order to investigate whether astroglia alone could
respond to 17beta-estradiol, purified astrocytes cultured from
mouse mesencephalon were also analyzed for er expression.
as shown in fig. 1b, in purified astrocytes,  xxxg730xxx  expression
was limited to the cytosolic fraction with low expression either
in the nuclear or in the membrane compartments. equivalent
proportions of each fraction were resolved by sds–page in
order to make a direct comparison as to the relative abundance.
this results in a lower level of protein analyzed in the
membrane fraction, which explains the low level of er
expression in the membrane fraction. expression of  xxxg731xxx  was
very low in all three fractions.
 xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  expressions were also visualized by double
fluorescence immunocytochemistry. as shown in figs. 2a, b,
primary mesencephalic cultures express both receptors, which
appear to be localized within the same neurons. the observed
 xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  expression on the same neurons was not caused
by fluorophore bleed-through because we still detected similar
er distribution in mesencephalic cultures stained with single
er-specific antibody (data not shown). consistent with the
western blot data, there was abundant expression of  xxxg730xxx  and
 xxxg731xxx  in the cytoplasm (figs. 2a, b). immunostaining of purified
astrocyte cultures revealed abundant expression of  xxxg730xxx  in
comparison to  xxxg731xxx  in agreement with western blot analysis and
more background than cellular staining of  xxxg731xxx  (figs. 2c, d).

771

interestingly, the dapi counterstain suggested that most of
 xxxg730xxx  was localized to the perinuclear compartment and
cytoplasm as was observed with the western blot data (figs.
2c, e). the dapi counterstain of  xxxg731xxx  showed that the overall
low level of  xxxg731xxx  expression was mostly cytoplasmic than
nuclear (figs. 2d, f).
to ascertain the expression of estrogen receptors on da
neurons, double label immunofluorescence was performed
using th as a dopaminergic marker. fig. 3a shows primary
mesencephalic neurons immunocytochemically labeled with
th (red) and  xxxg730xxx  (green). merged figures reveal double
staining of  xxxg730xxx  in the cell body of da neurons, which was
evident in all th+ cells. to confirm previous results of  xxxg730xxx 
expression in pure astrocyte cultures, mixed mesencephalic
cultures were doubly labeled with gfap (green) and  xxxg730xxx  (red).
merged figures reveal abundant staining of  xxxg730xxx  in astrocytes
(fig. 3b).
estrogen prevents mpp+-induced loss of th-immunoreactive
(th-ir) cells in primary mesencephalic cultures
cell counts of th-ir da neurons were used as a measurement of mpp+ toxicity of da neurons. treatment with 1, 5 and
10 mum mpp+ caused a dose-dependent reduction in th-ir cells
(fig. 4, ***p < 0.001 compared to vehicle control). 10 mum
mpp+, which caused a 50% reduction in the number of th-ir
cells, was used for the remainder of the experiments.

not further protect against th-ir cell loss (data not shown).
furthermore, adding 17beta-estradiol during or post mpp +
treatment, without pre-treatment, did not protect da neurons
from mpp+-induced cell death (data not shown).
 xxxg730xxx  activation is required for estrogen-mediated protection of
da neurons

initial does response experiments in the range of 10 pm to
100 nm 17beta-estradiol were conducted and no protection from
mpp+ toxicity was observed until 10 nm, which displayed full
protection (data not shown). treatments were organized into
seven groups: control, 24-h pre-treatment with 17beta-estradiol
(10 nm), 24-h treatment with mpp+ (10 mum), and 0.25-, 0.5-,
1-, 4- and 24-h pre-treatment with 17beta-estradiol followed by a
24-h treatment with mpp+. as shown in fig. 5, treatment with
17beta-estradiol alone had no effect on the number of th-ir
neurons and was comparable to control, while treatment with
10 mum mpp+ significantly reduced the number of th-ir cells by
55% (fig. 5, ***p < 0.001 compared to vehicle-treated control).
an increase in th-ir cell protection from mpp+ toxicity was
observed with increased time of 17beta-estradiol pre-treatment.

to determine if the estrogen-mediated protection of da
neurons was er-dependent, cultures were treated with the 17betaestradiol stereoisomer, 17alpha-estradiol and the er alpha/beta antagonist,  xxxd2165xxx  (ici). 17alpha-estradiol failed to protect against
mpp + -induced neurotoxicity, whereas application of ici
(1 mum) 1 h prior to 17beta-estradiol exposure completely blocked
the neuroprotection provided by estrogen (fig. 6, ++p < 0.01
compared to 17beta-estradiol plus mpp+ treatment).
to determine the contribution of the er alpha or beta subtype to the
neuroprotective effect of estrogen, mesencephalic cultures were
pre-treated with 17beta-estradiol, 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)1,1,1-trichloroethane (hpte), an  xxxg730xxx -specific agonist (roy
et al., 1999), diarylpropiolnitrile (dpn), an  xxxg731xxx -specific
agonist (frasor et al., 2003) or hpte simultaneously with
dpn for 24 h prior to exposure with mpp+. as observed
previously, 24-h exposure of 10 mum mpp+ induced a significant
decrease in the number of th-ir neurons compared to vehicle
control (fig. 7, ***p < 0.001 compared to vehicle control). as
expected, 24 h (10 nm) completely protected against mpp+induced loss of th-ir cells (fig. 7, ###p < 0.001 compared to
mpp+-treated control). hpte (10 nm), which had no effect on
th cell number when given alone, also protected against

discussion

fig. 7. neuroprotective effect of estrogen on th-ir is mediated by  xxxg730xxx . mouse
mesencephalic cultures were pre-treated with 17beta-estradiol, hpte, or dpn for
24 h prior to the addition of mpp+ (10 mum). results are presented as number of
th-ir cells, expressed as percent of control, and represent the mean ± sem of

mpp+-induced loss of th-ir cells (fig. 7, ###p < 0.001 compared to mpp+-treated control). on the other hand, dpn
afforded no significant protection from mpp+-induced th cell
loss and was comparable to mpp+ treatment alone. in addition,
hpte and dpn combined did not provide any further
protection than hpte alone (data not shown), thus eliminating
the role of  xxxg731xxx  in conjunction with  xxxg730xxx  in the neuroprotective
effects of a 24-h pre-treatment.

examined whether the presence of glia in mesencephalic
cultures was necessary to induce protection by 17beta-estradiol.
5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (dfur), a mitotic inhibitor, was used
to remove glial cells from primary mesencephalic cultures.
cells were pre-treated with 17beta-estradiol as previously
described; however, cultures were treated with a lower
concentration of mpp+ (5 mum) since, in the absence of glia,
the sensitivity to mpp+-induced toxicity increases (data not
shown). consistent with the above results, mpp+ (5 mum)
induced a 55% decrease in th-ir neurons and treatment with
17beta-estradiol alone caused no significant change in the number
of th-ir cells (fig. 8, ###p < 0.001 compared to vehicle control).
however, 24-h pre-treatment with 17beta-estradiol followed by
mpp+ exposure no longer protected against the loss of th-ir
cells (fig. 8, ***p < 0.001 compared to vehicle-treated control).
non-dfur-treated cells pre-treated with 17beta-estradiol for 24 h
served as a positive control and showed similar protection from
mpp+ as previously observed (fig. 8, +++p < 0.001 compared to
mpp+ treatment). the total number of th-ir cells did not differ
between dfur and non-dfur treatments (data not shown).
these results suggest a crucial role for glia in the  xxxg730xxx -mediated
protection of da neurons by estrogen.

17beta-estradiol displays survival promoting and neuroprotective effects; however, our studies demonstrate that its actions are
highly dependent on surrounding glial cells. by counting the
number of th-ir neurons after estrogenic and mpp+ exposure,
we found 17beta-estradiol and hpte ( xxxg730xxx -specific agonist) to be
significantly neuroprotective against mpp+-induced da cell
loss. pre-treatment for at least 4 h was required to induce
significant protection of da neurons from mpp+ toxicity and
was comparable to a 24-h pre-treatment. these neuroprotective
effects of 17beta-estradiol were observed only when mesencephalic neurons were cultured in the presence of glia. treating
the cultures with dfur to eliminate astrocytes completely
abolished the observed estrogen-induced neuroprotection. the
dependence of glia to elicit the  xxxg730xxx -mediated neuroprotection
was supported by the immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
data showing abundant expression of  xxxg730xxx  in glial cultures.
these data are consistent with recent findings suggesting an
interaction of estrogen with glial cells to induce neuroprotection
(dhandapani et al., 2005; pawlak et al., 2005).
neuroprotective studies with estrogen have demonstrated the
requirement of an estrogen pre-treatment prior to neurotoxin
exposure in order to display neuroprotective effects. results
from this study support the notion that there is a time-specific
response of estrogen on neuronal survival, which is dependent
on the duration of estrogen exposure prior to injury. in the
present study, estrogen-mediated neuroprotection against
mpp+-induced da cell loss could be observed by 1 h of
estrogen pre-treatment with a rise in protection occurring by 4 h
and full protection by 24 h of pre-treatment. these observations
do not necessarily rule out rapid membrane signaling (seconds
to minutes), since estrogen-mediated effects at the membrane

may also lead to downstream signaling and regulation of gene
expression, which is observable hours later.
a previous study in rat mesencephalic cultures demonstrated
protective properties of 17beta-estradiol and its inactive stereoisomer, 17alpha-estradiol against mpp+ induced toxicity (callier et
al., 2002). neuroprotection was only observed using high
concentrations of mpp+ (50 mum), which is no longer selective
for the da neuron. the protection was likely due to antioxidant
properties of the steroids as only concentrations in the high
micromolar range (10–100 mum) were able to induce protective
effects. in addition the protection against mpp+ toxicity was
observed in serum-supplemented and not serum-free medium,
which could also contribute to the neuroprotection. in contrast,
our study utilized mouse mesencephalic cultures grown in
serum-free conditions and all treatments were conducted in
serum-free defined media to eliminate possible protective
effects by amino acids, hormones and growth factors present
in serum. however, consistent with callier et al. (2002), full
protection was not observed with a 1-h 17beta-estradiol pretreatment as a longer pre-treatment (at least 4 h) was necessary
to induce full neuroprotection. the lower concentrations of
steroid used to elicit protection, the lack of protection by 17alphaestradiol, and the blocking of neuroprotection by ici, the nonselective er alpha/beta antagonist, reduce the likelihood of an
antioxidant effect of 17beta-estradiol in our studies.
a second study in rat primary mesencephalic cultures
showed that low concentrations (1–10 nm) of both 17betaestradiol and 17alpha-estradiol were neuroprotective against mpp+induced neuronal toxicity and both effects were completely
reversed by ici (sawada et al., 2002). such protection was
postulated to involve a decrease in tnf-alpha levels (sawada et al.,
2002). this was supported by western blot data, which showed
only  xxxg731xxx  staining and a decrease in tnf-alpha staining after 17betaestradiol treatment. we found expression of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  in
the mouse mesencephalic and glial cultures by both western
blotting and immunofluorescence and the use of the eralphaspecific agonist, hpte established a functional role for the
observed  xxxg730xxx . expression of both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  mrna has
been reported in the embryonic rat mesencephalon (lu et al.,
2004; raab et al., 1999), therefore it is unclear as to why there
was no observable expression of  xxxg730xxx  by sawada et al. (2002).
the screening of estrogenic compounds specific to either
 xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  revealed hpte, an  xxxg730xxx -specific agonist, as a
significant protectant against mpp+-induced da cell loss. dpn,
the  xxxg731xxx -specific agonist afforded no protection alone or in
combination with hpte, which indicated that  xxxg731xxx  did not play
a role in the observed protection by 17beta-estradiol of th
neurons 24 h post mpp+ treatment. these studies are consistent
with reports of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection through  xxxg730xxx 
(cordey and pike, 2005; dubal et al., 2006; zhao et al., 2004).
studies in ischemic er knockout mice demonstrated that unlike
 xxxg731xxx  knockouts, in ovariectomized  xxxg730xxx  knockouts estrogen
replacement no longer protected against cerebral ischemia
(dubal et al., 2001). studies by zhao et al. (2004) report a
protective effect of ppt, another  xxxg730xxx -selective agonist, in
addition to dpn against glutamate-induced toxicity in primary
hippocampal neurons.

in our mesencephalic culture system, dpn did not protect
against mpp+-induced damage of da neurons. however, this
does not rule out a role for  xxxg731xxx -mediated neuroprotection
because although no effect of dpn was found 24 h post mpp+
treatment, it remains possible that  xxxg731xxx  may be involved in the
later stages of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection such as
regeneration and survival of protected neurons. the role of
 xxxg731xxx  in neuronal survival has been studied in  xxxg731xxx  knockout
mice where the lack of  xxxg731xxx  results in morphological deficits
characterized by brain atrophy and neuronal shrinkage (wang et
al., 2003). in addition, studies have shown an immediate
induction of  xxxg730xxx  followed by a down-regulation of  xxxg731xxx  in late
stage ischemic injury (24 h), which is prevented by estrogen
treatment (dubal et al., 2006). similarly, in this study, the initial
estrogen-mediated neuroprotective actions of estrogen were
 xxxg730xxx -mediated, occurring within 24 h of mpp+ exposure. it will
be of interest to further examine the role of  xxxg731xxx  on neuronal
survival at later times after mpp+ exposure.
defining the neuroprotective role of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  becomes
complex when comparing different models of neurodegeneration, which utilize different species and/or modes of inducing
neuronal damage. although the mechanisms of action reported
differ in each case, the commonality is the neuroprotection
afforded by estrogen. in addition, the time point at which
estrogen-induced neuroprotection is measured is critical
because these differences may dictate the specific role of each
er subtype. furthermore, since estrogen appears to target
multiple cell types, studying estrogen signaling in a system that
allows estrogen to interact with both neuronal and non-neuronal
cells would provide a more comprehensive understanding of
estrogen-mediated neuroprotection.
in the present study, protection of da neurons was abolished
when mesencephalic cultures were devoid of glia, which
suggested a role for glia in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection.
dfur inhibited glia cell proliferation resulting in the detachment of glia cells from mesencephalic cultures. the concentration of mpp+ utilized in the dfur-treated mesencephalic
cultures was lower than the 10 mum mpp+ used in experiments
where glia were present in the cultures in order to achieve only
50% reduction of th-ir neurons in the 24-h period. in response
to toxicity, glia become activated and presumably release
soluble factors to protect and maintain neuronal homeostasis,
which may explain why in the presence of glia, 10 mum mpp+
was necessary to induce a 50% reduction of th-ir neurons and
in the absence of glia, 5 mum mpp+ was sufficient to reduce thir neurons by 50%. when the neurons depleted of glia were
subjected to mpp+ exposure, 17beta-estradiol pre-treatments no
longer protected neurons from mpp + toxicity. the data
presented here indicates an interaction of estrogen with glial
cells to facilitate the observed protection of da neurons.
such estrogen–glial cell interactions have been studied in
models of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection and suggest a
distinct responsiveness of astrocytes to estrogen (dhandapani et
al., 2005; garcia-ovejero et al., 2005; pawlak et al., 2005).
studies have shown signaling pathways targeted by estrogen as
well as downstream neurotrophic growth factors regulated in
response to estrogen. dhandapani et al. showed that estrogen

m. bains et al. / experimental neurology 204 (2007) 767–776

treatment increased the expression and release of both  xxxg2269xxx 
and tgf-beta2 in cortical astrocytes through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)–akt signaling pathway (dhandapani et
al., 2005). furthermore in the presence of the pi3k inhibitors,
 xxxd2523xxx  and  xxxd3536xxx , estrogen no longer protected
cortical neurons from  xxxd412xxx -induced neuronal toxicity
(dhandapani et al., 2005). such rapid signaling suggests actions
by a membrane estrogen responsive system, which has been
described in mouse midbrain astroglial cultures (pawlak et al.,
2005). estrogen was found to phosphorylate and activate both
src and  xxxg1369xxx /2, with maximum phosphorylation occurring  xxxd2274xxx 
and 15 min, respectively, an effect that was suggested to be
mediated by  xxxg730xxx  (pawlak et al., 2005). indeed it is possible that
estrogen acting on glial cell membrane ers may activate signal
transduction pathways to regulate downstream transcription
and/or release of proteins, which act to protect against mpp+
toxicity. together, these studies further support the notion that
estrogen-mediated neuroprotection involves several mechanisms, direct and indirect, which, when integrated together,
promote neuronal survival.
in summary, the current findings demonstrate that estrogenmediated neuroprotection of da neurons involves an interplay
of more than one cell type. in addition, the study indicates that
estrogen effects are time-dependent, suggestive of a signal
transduction response regulating protein phosphorylation and/
or downstream transcription. the requirement of glia to elicit
estrogen effects supports an indirect estrogen action to protect
da neurons, possibly by inhibiting the endogenous proinflammatory and/or enhancing the protective properties of
glial cells. further studies are necessary to characterize estrogen
signaling in non-neuronal cells and to determine estrogenmediated signals between cell types resulting in the observed
neuroprotection. thus, restoring the depletion of estrogen in the
aging brain may prevent the loss of estrogen-mediated trophic
support, thus reducing the risk for neurodegenerative diseases
such as parkinson's disease.
