mechanisms of the natriuretic effects of  xxxg1417xxx  inhibition in dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats.  to explore the mechanisms of the renal effects of  xxxg1417xxx  (nep) inhibition, the effects of an nep inhibitor,  xxxd419xxx  (uk 79,300; uk), in dahl salt-sensitive (ss) and salt-resistant (sr) rats were examined. uk dose-dependently decreased blood pressure (bp) in ss rats (20 mg/kg: 174 +/- 5 vs. 155 +/- 8 mm hg, p < 0.01) but not in sr rats. urinary sodium excretion (unav) of both rat strains receiving high-salt diets was increased to a greater extent than that of rats receiving low-salt diets. basal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) level in hypertensive ss rats was higher than in sr rats (192 +/- 18 vs. 118 +/- 24 pg/ml, p < 0.05). uk increased anp levels in the plasma and urine two- and 11-fold, respectively. uk-induced increases in unav, urinary  xxxd1274xxx , and plasma anp concentrations were significantly augmented by coadministration of a clearance receptor agonist, c-anf(4-23) or brain natriuretic peptide (bnp). thus, the effects of nep inhibition appear to be potentiated by the reduced receptor-mediated metabolism of anp. this may explain the greater response to the nep inhibitor in dahl rats with hypertension or high-salt feeding.
