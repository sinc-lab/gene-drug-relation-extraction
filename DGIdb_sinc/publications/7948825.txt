abstract  xxxd3252xxx  is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of
action. recent studies highlight the capacity of  xxxd3252xxx  to bind  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ) and
deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer.  xxxg787xxx  stimulates the production of
granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. the
effect of  xxxd3252xxx  in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse
rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing.  xxxd3252xxx  has been demonstrated to be efficacious in
healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term
use and maintenance. in stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and
has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or h2
antagonists. the potential advantages of  xxxd3252xxx  lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with
longer duration of remission.

key words: growth factors, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer,  xxxd3252xxx .

introduction
 xxxd3252xxx , a basic aluminium salt of sucrose octasulphate,
is a unique, locally active ulcer healing agent. it has a
wide range of mechanisms of action.  xxxd3252xxx  is one of
the few drugs that exhibit both acute gastroprotection and
chronic ulcer healing properties in patients and experimental animals without suppression of gastric acidity.
during the asian-pacific congress of gastroenterology
held in bangkok in december 1992,  xxxd3252xxx  was
discussed by a group of ulcer experts at a pharmaceutical
company sponsored symposium. this review draws attention to newer proposed mechanisms of action, its efficacy
and safety in the treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric
ulcer, reflux oesophagitis and in prophylaxis against stress
ulcer.

mechanism of action
the mechanism of action is multi-factorial, but not all its
effects are equally important for acute mucosal protection
and for accelerated healing of chronic duodenal ulcer.*
initial concepts of  xxxd3252xxx ’s mode of action included
both direct binding to the ulcer crater and the stimulation

of endogenous prostaglandin production within the gastric mucosa, resulting in improved site-protection. it may
also have a role in adsorbing to the gastric mucosa,
enhancing the protective effect of the surface-active
phospholipid mucosal barrier and the mucus needed to
stabilize it.3
more recently, these concepts have been expanded to
include the important role of growth factors. epidermal
growth factor (egf) is secreted by salivary and brunner’s
glands. this is a potent gastric protective agent stimulating the proliferation of epithelial cells, and to a lesser
extent, some of the cellular components of granulation
tissue. nexo and poulsen demonstrated an enhanced
binding of egf in  xxxd3252xxx -treated rats, indicating that
elevated local levels of e g f might play a role in the
mechanism of acute gastroprotection by ~ucralfate.~
however, e g f does not bind directly to  xxxd3252xxx  and its
contribution to  xxxd3252xxx -related ulcer healing is uncertain.
 xxxd3252xxx  binds avidly to  xxxg787xxx 
( xxxg787xxx ) because of the profound heparin-like binding
activity of the drug.  xxxg787xxx  has very
potent ulcer healing properties related to its stimulation
of granulation tissue production, angiogenesis and proliferation of smooth muscle cellse5indeed,  xxxd3252xxx  and its
water-soluble potassium sucrose octasulphate derivative
avidly bind  xxxg787xxx  both in oitro and in oioo, delivering it

 xxxd3252xxx : the bangkok review
in large concentrations to an ulcer crater.6 further,
 xxxd3252xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  synergisticallyaccelerate the healing
of chronic (chemically induced) erosive ga~tritis.~
importantly, ulcer healing with  xxxd3252xxx  and/or  xxxg787xxx  is
achieved without reduction in acid secretion.
thus growth factors, especially  xxxg787xxx , play an important role in the mechanism of action of  xxxd3252xxx .
 xxxd3252xxx  binds  xxxg787xxx  synergistically, giving gastric protection by maintenance of blood flow, minimization of
vascular injury (induced chemically) and allowing surviving epithelial cells to repair any defects. in chronic ulcer,
 xxxd3252xxx  binds and concentrates  xxxg787xxx  at the ulcer
crater, prompting production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization - the basis of quality ulcer
healing.

efficacy in ulcer healing
 xxxd3252xxx  given in a dose of 4 g/day (1 g three times daily
30 min before meals and 1 g at night), has been shown to
be significantly better than placebo and as effective as
cimetidine (0.8-1.2 g/day) or ranitidine (150 mg twice
daily), in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers. l4
healing rates after 4 weeks of  xxxd3252xxx  therapy range
from 60 to 92% in duodenal ulcer patients and 47 to 62%
in gastric ulcer patients. gastric ulcer healing rates after 8
weeks of therapy are of the order of 75 to 83%. the
combined use of  xxxd3252xxx  and cimetidine for active
duodenal ulcer is not more effective than either drug

newer dosage regimen

acid rebound a n d h. pylori
there is good evidence that the site-protective agents,
including  xxxd3252xxx , result in lower relapse rates after
duodenal ulcer healing, compared to histamine (h2)
receptor antagonists.8 there are a number of proposed
explanations, including better angiogenesis and less inflammation, alteration in gastrin levels, altered  xxxg1079xxx  regulation: helicobucter pylori and parietal cell
sensitivity. marks et al. l o demonstrated significant reduction in parietal cell sensitivity with ulcer healing induced
by  xxxd3252xxx  compared to ranitidine. a large hong kong
study showed a correlation between reduction in h. pylori
organisms and a significant reduction in the degree of
gastritis.” there is a certain amount of evidence to
suggest  xxxd3252xxx  may have an effect on h . pylori. a
recent paper from south africa shows similar h. pylori
eradication in duodenal ulcer patients treated with two
antibiotics (metronidazole and tetracycline) plus either
 xxxd3252xxx  or bismuth.l 2 this is preliminary evidence that
 xxxd3252xxx  could be used in a triple therapy regimen
directed against h. pylori, much as bismuth has been.
mechanistic studies suggest that there are acute effects
of  xxxd3252xxx  on h. pylori.  xxxd3252xxx  may, in part, prevent
the breakdown of gastric mucus by h. pylori-derived
proteases and lipases, and also may inhibit bacterial
colonization by h. pylori, which disrupts mucosal laminin
receptors by its phospholipase activity. overall, these
results may explain the differences in inflammation and
in secretory response observed following treatment with
 xxxg1079xxx  antagonists or  xxxd3252xxx . this remains a
challenging area of research and brings together many of
the current topics of great interest in peptic ulcer disease,
particularly the mechanisms of inflammation in the
gastric and duodenal mucosa.

clinical results i n peptic
ulcer a n d r e f l u x oesophagitis
 xxxd3252xxx  is a safe and effective drug in the short and long
term management of patients with peptic ulcer disease
and in those with mild to moderate degrees of reflux
oesophagitis.

single- and double-blind studies have shown that  xxxd3252xxx  given in a dose of 2 g twice daily (on waking and
before bed) is as effective as the conventional dose of 1 g
four times daily in both duodenal ulcer and gastric ulcer
healing.14,16

newer preparations
 xxxd3252xxx  is available in tablet form (1 g), in granular
form (1 g sachet) and in a palatable suspension. the latter
contains either 1 g of  xxxd3252xxx  per 5 ml or 1 g per
10 ml. the suspension is the preferred formulation in
the treatment of reflux oesophagitis, in the intensive care
setting, and in the occasional patient who may experience
difficulty swallowing the 1 g tablet.

smoking and duodenal ulcer healing
data derived from six duodenal ulcer studies suggest that
smoking has no adverse effect on healing in sucralfatetreated patients. the healing rate among 198 smokers
and 173 non-smokers culled from these studies was 79
and 77%, respectively.16

maintenance treatment
duodenal ulcer
the efficacy of  xxxd3252xxx  in maintenance therapy has been
amply confirmed in a number of placebo and cimetidinecontrolled studies. these showed  xxxd3252xxx  to be significantly better than placebo and at least as effective as
cimetidine or ranitidine. the dose of  xxxd3252xxx  in these
studies was 2-2.5 g/day and in all but one of them the drug
was given in divided d ~ s e s . ~ ~ j ~ j ~

gastric ulcer
the efficacy of  xxxd3252xxx  given in a dose 1 g twice daily,
or 2 g at night, in maintenance therapy has also been
demonstrated in a number of placebo and cimetidinecontrolled studies. the drug has been shown to be
significantly better than placebo and at least as effective as
cimetidine.14,16~1

relapse rates after  xxxd3252xxx  therapy
after ulcer healing
an early study showed that  xxxd3252xxx -healed ulcers have
a longer duration of remission than those following
short-term treatment with cimetidine.'* three subsequent studies showed only a marginal advantage of
 xxxd3252xxx  over cimetidine, but the duodenal ulcer study
of 238 patients by lam et al. showed the remission period
following  xxxd3252xxx  healing to be double that of
cimetidine.l9 more recent ranitidine-controlled duodenal
ulcer studies showed a similar advantage of  xxxd3252xxx  in
terms of early relapse.16

after maintenance therapy
the data following withdrawal of maintenance therapy
are perhaps more controversial, but most studies have
also shown  xxxd3252xxx  to have an advantage over h2
receptor antagonists in this context.8i20
the reason for the differences in relapse rates is not
clear. acid rebound following treatment with an h2
receptor antagonist may be relevant, but differences in the
degree of inflammation and quality of healing and a
possible  xxxd3252xxx  effect on h.pylori cannot be excluded.

reflux oesophagitis
 xxxd3252xxx  given in a dose of 4-6 g/day has been shown to
be superior to placebo and as effective as  xxxg1079xxx 
antagonists and antacidlalginate preparations in the shortterm treatment of reflux oesophagitis in studies carried
out in over 700 patients with grades 0-2 oesophagitis.
healing rates of the order of 50-65%, with improvement
in a further 20-30%, have been noted in most 8 week
studies, with variations being due mainly to the severity of
the disease and precise dosage schedules.2'.22the highest
healing rates occurred in those studies containing the
greatest proportion of patients with grade 1 or 2 oesophagitis. patients with more advanced disease respond less
satisfactorily.

safety profile in routine clinical practice
clinical
 xxxd3252xxx  is well tolerated. constipation occurs in about
3% of patients and nausea and mild headaches are rarely
encountered. a rare complication has been bezoar formation in the o e s o p h a g ~ s . ~ ~

phosphate and vitamin bi 2 binding
 xxxd3252xxx  reduces the hyper-phosphataemia in chronic
uraemia, albeit at the risk of raised blood aluminium
levels, but has no measurable effect on normal phosphate
levels in patients with normal renal function.  xxxd3252xxx 
has no effect on vitamin b12 absorption.

drug interactions
the bioavailability of phenytoin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics and l-thyroxine may be impaired by concomitant
dosing with  xxxd3252xxx , but normal kinetics are restored by
administering the drug 2 h before  xxxd3252xxx . whether
 xxxd3252xxx  inhibits absorption of  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists
remains uncertain.

stress ulcer prophylaxis
stress ulcers are multiple lesions involving the gastric
mucosa and located primarily in the acid-secreting gastric
fundus and body. these lesions can be seen in various
medical and surgical conditions and may cause minor
episodes of bleeding or major haemorrhage with a fatal
outcome. attempts have been made to optimize intensive
care and medical treatment to reduce the incidence of
stress ulcer bleeding.

incidence of stress ulcer bleeding
in intensive care unit patients, the incidence of endoscopically verified stress ulcer may range from 60 to 100%.
occult bleeding from these lesions is considerably less
common (15-25%), while obvious bleeding is still less
common ( ~ 5 % ) . ~ ~
the likelihood of bleeding from stress ulceration increases with a number of risk factors, such as sepsis,
peritonitis, respiratory failure, head injury, burns, hepatic
failure, multiple trauma, hypotension, renal failure, major
operative procedures and especially if any of these are
combined with mechanical ventilation. thus, in the
routine postoperative patient, stress ulceration is rare.
in recent years, the incidence of stress ulcer seems to
have declined. this is believed to be partly due to greater
awareness that trauma and bleeding increase the risk of
stress ulcers; early resuscitation at the site of trauma has
proved important. intensive care treatment has improved
in regard to the attention paid to the balance of fluid and
electrolytes and general body homeostasis.

a1uminium

prophylaxis

the total aluminium load in patients on full-dose  xxxd3252xxx  therapy (4glday) is of the order of 800mg/day.
 xxxd3252xxx  is only minimally absorbed, however, and the
small amount of aluminium absorbed is readily excreted
in patients with normal renal function, while the drug
should be used with caution in patients with poor renal
function.24 a 12 month maintenance study showed no
alteration in serum aluminium and phosphate levels.20

the aim of stress ulcer prophylaxis is to decrease morbidity and mortality. the drugs that have been used for stress
ulcer prophylaxis are antacids,  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists
and  xxxd3252xxx . omeprazole has not as yet been studied in
prophylactic regimens, but has been used in the treatment of established bleeding.
antacids,  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists and  xxxd3252xxx  have
all been compared to placebo. tryba in a large meta-

sucraljate: the bangkok review

analysis found that both antacids and  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists were significantly better than placebo in reducing
stress ulcer bleeding.26  xxxd3252xxx  achieves similar prophylaxis to antacids or to  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists.26
side effects with antacids,  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists and
 xxxd3252xxx  are relatively uncommon in clinical practice.25
importantly, in intensive care units, a possible higher
incidence of nosocomial pneumonia following acid reduction was suggested by craven et al2’ if acid inhibition
led to nosocomial pneumonia, this would suggest that the
prophylaxis for stress ulcer may increase the risk to the
patient.28heyland and mandel found that the incidence
of nosocomial pneumonia correlated directly with the rate
of gastric colonization by gram-negative bacilli.zs tryba
found that  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists or antacids were
associated with higher rates of pneumonia, as compared
to  xxxd3252xxx .26thus,  xxxd3252xxx  may protect equally with
high dose antacids or  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists, but result
in lower rates of nosocomial pneumonia.29
