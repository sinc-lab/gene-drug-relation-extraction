(ipc) induces a state of cardioprotection against subsequent prolonged ischemia-reperfusion injury. the cardioprotective mechanism of ipc is complex and
involves a variety of triggers that activate multiple signaling
pathways, most converging on mitochondria (37). the cellular
survival program activated by ipc integrates several processes,
including opening of atp-sensitive potassium channels (20,
56), regulation of fatty acid metabolism (28), production of
reactive oxygen species (41), and regulation of mitochondrial
permeability transition (25). moreover, ipc elicits protective
effects on cellular bioenergetic status by downmodulating the
atpase activity of mitochondrial atp synthase, thereby promoting cell survival after ischemic insult (2, 6, 14, 24, 43, 55).

pharmacological preconditioning is a cardioprotective state
similar to ipc.  xxxd1868xxx , an antihypertensive and antihypoglycemic drug, is commonly used to induce preconditioning in
animal models of ischemia-reperfusion (17, 20). this hydrophobic compound passively enters cells and organelles like
mitochondria. functionally,  xxxd1868xxx  is commonly considered
as a selective opener of mitochondrial atp-sensitive potassium (mitokatp) channels (18, 19, 20), but at relatively high
concentrations (⬎100 ␮m) the drug has other effects, including the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (22, 48). interestingly, similar to ipc,  xxxd1868xxx  has beneficial bioenergetic
consequences in perfused rat hearts and isolated rat heart
mitochondria (2, 6, 33).
activation of mitokatp channels is considered to be a major
trigger or end effector of ipc (19, 20, 40), even if some authors
have provided renewed support for a role of sarcolemmal katp
channels in ischemic cardioprotection (47, 51). evidence for
the existence of mitokatp channels and for their involvement
in ipc derives from pharmacological studies, since katp
channel openers (e.g.,  xxxd1868xxx ) mimic ipc and  xxxg1253xxx 
blockers (e.g.,  xxxd2215xxx ) inhibit ipc (17, 19, 20, 23).
however, the molecular structure of mitokatp channels is not
clear yet (12, 34), despite recent advances in understanding its
structure (3, 30). moreover, alternative mechanisms have been
recently overviewed (4, 23).
mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase is the major producer of
atp for contractile function and ionic homeostasis in cardiomyocytes (13). when oxygen deprivation collapses the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient, f0f1 atp synthase
switches from atp synthesis to atp hydrolysis and thus,
during severe ischemia, is a major consumer of atp (13).
therefore, inhibition of f0f1 atp synthase during ischemia,
which should conserve myocardial atp, may play a key role in
the energy-sparing effect elicited by ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning (2, 6, 24, 55). numerous authors have
suggested that inhibition of the atpase activity of f0f1 atp
synthase is carried out by the enzyme’s natural inhibitor
protein, if1 (2, 7, 24, 55). if1 is a noncompetitive inhibitor that
reversibly binds with 1:1 stoichiometry to the ␤-subunit of f1,
the catalytic sector of f0f1 atp synthase; binding requires
atp hydrolysis associated with loss of proton motive force and
is favored by a low mitochondrial electrochemical gradient
(32). we recently documented (14, 43) that if1 binding to f0f1
atp synthase increases during ipc in goat heart in vivo. in
addition, by studying both the purified enzyme and isolated
mitochondrial membranes from beef heart, we demonstrated

comelli m, metelli g, mavelli i. downmodulation of mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase by  xxxd1868xxx  in cardiac myoblasts: a dual
effect of the drug. am j physiol heart circ physiol 292: h820 –h829,
2007; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00366.2006.—similar to ischemic preconditioning,  xxxd1868xxx  was documented to elicit beneficial bioenergetic consequences linked to cardioprotection. inhibition of atpase
activity of mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase may have a role in such
effect and may involve the natural inhibitor protein if1. we recently
documented, using purified enzyme and isolated mitochondrial membranes from beef heart, that  xxxd1868xxx  interacts with the f1 sector of
f0f1 atp synthase by promoting if1 binding and reversibly inhibiting atp hydrolysis. here we investigated the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on
the enzyme in cultured myoblasts. specifically, embryonic heartderived h9c2 cells were exposed to  xxxd1868xxx  and mitochondrial
atpase was assayed in conditions maintaining steady-state if1 binding (basal atpase activity) or detaching bound if1 at alkaline ph.
mitochondrial transmembrane potential and uncoupling were also
investigated, as well as atp synthesis flux and atp content.  xxxd1868xxx  at a cardioprotective concentration (40 ␮m cell-associated concentration) transiently downmodulated basal atpase activity, concomitant with mild mitochondria uncoupling and depolarization, without affecting atp synthesis and atp content. alkaline stripping of if1
from f0f1 atp synthase was less in  xxxd1868xxx -treated than in untreated
cells. pretreatment with  xxxd2215xxx  prevented, together with mitochondria depolarization, inhibition of atpase activity under basal but not
under if1-stripping conditions, indicating that  xxxd1868xxx  alters alkaline
if1 release.  xxxd1868xxx  inhibition of atpase activity in if1-stripping
conditions was observed even when mitochondrial transmembrane potential was reduced by fccp. the results suggest that  xxxd1868xxx  in a
model of normoxic intact cells directly promotes binding of inhibitor
protein if1 to f0f1 atp synthase and enhances if1 binding indirectly by
mildly uncoupling and depolarizing mitochondria.

dual effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase

(9) that interaction of  xxxd1868xxx  with the ␤-subunit of the f1
sector promotes binding with if1 and reversibly inhibits atp
hydrolysis. in the present study, we continued our investigation
of  xxxd1868xxx ’s effect on f0f1 atp synthase, using a biological
model of embryonic heart-derived myoblasts (h9c2). we provided evidence for a dual effect of  xxxd1868xxx  resulting in
enhancement of if1 binding to the enzyme and downmodulation of atpase activity, being a mild but detectable mitochondrial depolarization and uncoupling factor triggering such
binding.

and is reported as units (micromoles of atp per minute) per milligram of protein. furthermore, the buffer composition (containing
egta and ⬍5 mm na⫹ concentration) was chosen to minimize
interference from ca2⫹- and na⫹-k⫹-atpases (8); this was verified
experimentally by performing the assay with 10 ␮m sodium orthovanadate and 2 mm ouabain, respectively. oligomycin-sensitive
atpase activity, indicative of correct coupling of f0 and f1 moieties
of the f0f1 atp synthase complex, was assayed in the presence of 4
␮m oligomycin (8). oligomycin concentration was chosen on the
basis of a dose-dependence study of the atpase activity inhibitory
effect, which permitted us to avoid using submaximal concentrations.
cell-associated  xxxd1868xxx  concentration. h9c2 cells were incubated with 100 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx  in culture medium for 0 –30 min and
harvested by trypsinization. cell pellets were extracted with 0.33 n
perchloric acid (500 ␮l per 10-cm dish).
cell-associated  xxxd1868xxx  concentration was determined by an
hplc method (54) using a lichrosorb rp-8 column (10 cm ⫻ 4.6
mm internal diameter; particle size, 5 ␮m; chrompack, middelburg,
the netherlands). calibration curves, obtained by adding known
amounts of  xxxd1868xxx  to the culture medium immediately before
trypsinization, were linear for the range 0.02–10 ␮g (r ⫽ 0.966); the
sensitivity limit was 0.3 ␮m. the recovery of  xxxd1868xxx  from perchloric acid extracts was 85.2% (sd 0.9) (n ⫽ 4), based on a standard
curve.  xxxd1868xxx  for standard solutions was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide and diluted in water or culture medium to a final concentration of 0.01– 0.05%.
mitochondrial respiration assays. mitochondrial basal respiration
in intact (nonpermeabilized) h9c2 cells, treated with 100 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx  or vehicle for 10 and 30 min, was measured in 3 ⫻ 106 cells
suspended in 2 ml of culture medium. o2 consumption was measured
in an oxygraphic cell at 37°c with a clark-type o2 electrode (yellow
springs instruments, yellow springs, oh). the solubility of o2 was
taken to be 200 nmol o2/ml. addition of 1 mm kcn completely
suppressed o2 consumption, indicating that mitochondrial respiration
was being measured.
to assess the rate of respiration uncoupled from atp synthesis in
nonpermeabilized cells, fccp (5 ␮m) was added directly to the
oxygraphic cell. the ratio of fccp-stimulated respiration to basal
respiration was considered as the respiratory control ratio (rcr). to
assess the rate of respiration coupled to atp synthesis (atp synthesis
flux), 10 ␮m oligomycin was added directly to the oxygraphic
chamber containing nontreated or  xxxd1868xxx -treated cells; atp synthesis flux was calculated as the difference between basal respiration
rate and that measured in presence of oligomycin. fccp and oligomycin concentrations were chosen on the basis of dose dependence
studies of the respective effects on the basal respiration rate, which
permitted us to avoid using submaximal concentrations.
atp content. h9c2 cells were incubated for 10 –30 min with 100
␮m  xxxd1868xxx , 10 min with 25 ␮m fccp, or with the respective
vehicles in culture medium. cells were harvested by trypsinization
and extracted with 0.6 m trichloracetic acid (500 ␮l per 10-cm dish).
atp content was determined by hplc according to pogolotti and
santi (44), using a strong anion exchange column (partisil 10 sax; 25
cm ⫻ 4.6 mm; farmitalia, milan, italy).
mitochondrial transmembrane potential. mitochondrial transmembrane potential (⌬␺m) was measured by confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry, using the fluorescent probe 5,5⬘,6,6⬘-tetrachloro-1,1⬘,3,3⬘tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodine (jc-1; molecular
probes, eugene, or). subconfluent cultures (in 2-cm glass or 10-cm
plastic culture plates) were incubated with 100 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx , 25 ␮m
fccp, or vehicle for 10 or 30 min in culture medium. in some
experiments, cells were treated with 10 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  for 1 h. to
avoid cells being differently deprived of nutrients because of the
different incubation times required for the treatments, the medium was
replaced with fresh complete medium containing 10 ␮g/ml jc-1
before labeling for 5 min at 37°c in the dark.

chemicals and reagents. all materials were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo), unless otherwise stated.
cell cultures. h9c2, a clonal line of rat embryonic heart-derived
myoblasts, was obtained from american type culture collection
(crl-1446; rockville, md). the cells were maintained in culture
medium consisting of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (euroclone, devon, united kingdom), 10% fetal bovine serum (biochrom,
berlin, germany), penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml),
and glutamine (4 mm). to prevent loss of differentiation potential,
cells were not allowed to become confluent and were monitored for
the absence of tubular structure formation and myogenin expression.
passages 12–25 were used for all experiments described in this
article. cell density and viability were determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion test (10).
mitochondrial atpase assays. h9c2 cells, grown in 10-cm tissue
culture plates, were incubated in culture medium for 0 –30 min in the
presence of 10 – 400 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx  or vehicle (0.05%  xxxd1896xxx ). in some experiments, cells were treated with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (fccp) for 10 min at 25
␮m or with vehicle (0.1% ethanol). in some experiments, cells were
treated with 10 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  for 1 h. after treatments, cells were
harvested by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% edta in phosphate-buffered saline), pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in a
 xxxd1868xxx -free, ice-cold solution of buffer a (mm: 1 mgcl2, 2 egta,
20 hepes ph 7.0) or buffer b (mm: 1 mgcl2, 2 egta, 1 naatp, 20
hepes ph 9.2), and homogenized by sonication (up5og sonifier;
hielscher, berlin, germany). conditions were controlled to expose
catalytic sector f1 to solvent and to avoid uncoupling from the f0
domain (8). specifically, atpase activity was monitored during
ultrasonic treatment in the absence and in the presence of fccp to
evaluate breaking of mitochondria and formation of submitochondrial
particles (smp) and in the presence of oligomycin to ensure minimized damage to the enzyme coupling subunits during the treatment
(7). homogenization at ph 7.0 maintains the binding equilibrium
between if1 and f0f1 atp synthase, permitting us to measure “basal”
atpase activity, while homogenization at ph 9.2 detaches 95% of
bound if1 (46), permitting us to measure “potential” (uninhibited)
atpase activity. cell homogenates were assayed for atpase immediately. smp deprived of if1 were prepared accordingly to vadineanu
et al. (53). briefly, cells were homogenized by sonication in buffer b
and centrifuged at 150,000 g for 20 min at 4°c. the resulting pellet,
washed in buffer b, was then exposed to 100 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx  for 10 min
in buffer a or b, and atpase activity was assayed immediately. total
protein content was determined according to lowry et al. (36), with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
maximal atpase activity (vmax) was determined by coupling the
production of adp to the oxidation of nadh via pyruvate kinase and
lactic dehydrogenase reactions with a  xxxd1868xxx -free assay buffer
containing an atp-regenerating system (mm: 50 tris 䡠 hcl ph 7.4, 30
sucrose, 50 kcl, 4 mgcl2, 2 naatp, 2 egta, 2 phosphoenolpyruvate, and 300 nadh with 3 iu lactate dehydrogenase and 4 iu
pyruvate kinase). activity was measured by following nadh oxidation at 340 nm on a perkin-elmer vis-uv spectrometer lambda14

results

we first examined the effects elicited on the atpase activity
of mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase by the exposure of cultured h9c2 myoblasts to  xxxd1868xxx . when subconfluent cultures were homogenized at ph 7.0, atpase activity was 0.126
u/mg (sd 0.006) (n ⫽ 20). the presence of 10 ␮m na
orthovanadate and 2 mm ouabain reduced atpase activity by
2% and 7%, respectively, confirming that the assay conditions
were specific for mitochondrial atpase. nevertheless, the
oligomycin-sensitive atpase activity, indicative of correctly
assembled enzyme complex, was low [0.063 u/mg (sd
0.002)], although still in the range reported for cell lines
assayed under experimental conditions avoiding mitochondrial
isolation (5). this may suggest that disturbed assembly/stability of f0f1 atp synthase complex occurred in h9c2 cells,
considering that the homogenization conditions were carefully
controlled to minimize damage to the coupling subunits of the
enzyme.

sensitive atpase activity was observed at concentrations
known to have cardioprotective effects (50 –200 ␮m) (fig. 1).
the maximum inhibitory effect (26% and 27% in the two
cases) was achieved at 100 ␮m.  xxxd1868xxx  had no effect on
cell viability (data not shown).
the time course analysis of the inhibitory effects of 100 ␮m
 xxxd1868xxx  revealed maximal reduction in atpase activity over
10 min (fig. 2a). thereafter, activity remained relatively
constant until it returned to the control value at 30 min. the
profile of cell-associated  xxxd1868xxx  during the time course
paralleled that of the inhibitory effects, with a maximum
concentration  xxxd1891xxx  min (fig. 2b). concentrations of cellassociated  xxxd1868xxx  at all time points were less than the 100
␮m added to the medium and below those at which the drug
exerts pharmacological effects other than mitokatp activation
(e.g., inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase).
the fact that  xxxd1868xxx  inhibition of atpase was transient
pointed to a reversible downmodulation of f0f1 atp synthase,
probably by naturally occurring if1, similar to that we previously observed on ipc (14, 43). to test this hypothesis, taking
into account that if1 binding to f0f1 atp synthase is optimal
at ph 6.7 and that sonication at ph 9.2 releases 95% of bound

25%, showing that free if1 is available in cells but in a low
amount. fccp concentrations lower than 25 ␮m had little
effect in this cell system (data not shown). homogenization at
ph 9.2 fully overcame the protonophore’s inhibitory effects,
returning atpase activity to that of control cells and confirming that the inhibitory action of fccp is due to increased if1
binding. fccp treatment had no effect on cell viability, and its
vehicle had no effect on atpase activity (data not shown).
control experiments using smp deprived of if1 showed that
atpase activity was not affected by  xxxd1868xxx  at both ph 7.0
and 9.2 (fig. 3b), suggesting that the drug did not interfere per
se with the catalytic activity of the enzyme and confirming the
role of if1 in the atpase activity inhibition afforded by
 xxxd1868xxx .
the time course of  xxxd1868xxx  inhibition of mitochondrial
atpase assayed in homogenates prepared at ph 9.2 was
similar to that observed in homogenates prepared at physiological ph, with a rapid and significant decrease between 0 and
10 min and recovery at 30 min (fig. 4a). at all time points,
atpase activity in alkaline extracts was greater than that in ph
7.0 extracts. with the consideration that alkaline treatment
removes ⬎95% of bound if1 (46), the atpase activity observed in control cells at ph 9.2 was taken as the activity of
if1-free enzyme. on this basis, we calculated the amount of
if1-inhibited enzyme as the ratio of the enzyme activity mea-

only the oligomycin-sensitive respiration, i.e., respiration coupled to atp synthesis (atp synthesis flux), an overall low rate
[2.1 nmol o2 䡠min⫺1 䡠mg protein⫺1 (sd 0.2)] was observed in
control cells. this suggests that the proton gradient driving
atp formation was not perfectly tight to oxidative phosphorylation and that the atp synthesis control over respiration was
quite low. the low coupling might depend on both basal proton
leak and disturbed assembly/stability of f0f1 atp synthase
complex, which we suggested above to occur in control cells
on the basis of the observed low value of oligomycin-sensitive
atpase activity. when cells were incubated with 100 ␮m
 xxxd1868xxx  for 10 min, atp synthesis flux increased but not
significantly so. as expected, 10 min of 25 ␮m fccp blunted
atp synthesis flux. finally, in cells treated with 100 ␮m
 xxxd1868xxx  for 10 min, cellular atp content showed a negligible, nonsignificant increase (fig. 5b), while in cells treated
with 25 ␮m fccp for 10 min atp content was significantly
reduced. thus, in normoxic cells exposed to  xxxd1868xxx , mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase normally synthesized atp despite a significantly reduced vmax of atp hydrolysis.
the fact that  xxxd1868xxx  did not reduce atp levels agrees
with its small effect on atp synthesis flux and suggests that
the transient uncoupling is too moderate to significantly alter
mitochondrial energetics. if this is the case, membrane depolarization should also be moderate. therefore, we investigated
the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on ⌬␺m by monitoring the fluorescence
intensity of the lipophilic cation jc-1. at confocal microscopy,
control cells had punctuate red staining indicative of normal
mitochondrial uptake of jc-1 driven by high ⌬␺m (fig. 6a).
after treatment with  xxxd1868xxx  (10 min, 100 ␮m), cells maintained punctuate staining but were predominantly green with
some yellow, indicative of lower ⌬␺m; quantification of red
fluorescence intensity (590 nm) indicated a 23% (sd 2) decrease in ⌬␺m compared with control cells. cells treated with
fccp had blotchy greenish-yellow fluorescence, indicating
lower ⌬␺m but also undefined mitochondrial edges and leakage
of dye. similar results were observed at flow cytometry:
 xxxd1868xxx  treatment for 10 min altered the peak of the red
fluorescence intensity distribution (fig. 6b). mean fluorescence intensity was 26% (sd 2) less than in control cells (p ⬍
0.001), in agreement with confocal microscopy results. the
intensity profile for a 30-min treatment with  xxxd1868xxx  was
similar to that of control cells. fccp treatment resulted in a
54% (sd 3) reduction in mean red fluorescence intensity (p ⬍
0.001 vs. control cells). these results are in agreement with the
effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on mitochondrial atpase, and they suggest that  xxxd1868xxx  treatment of h9c2 cells moderately and
transiently decreases ⌬␺m, similar to its inhibition of f0f1 atp
synthase.
because of its hydrophobic nature,  xxxd1868xxx  passes through
membranes and may interact with f0f1 atp synthase irrespectively of its effects on mitokatp channels or mitochondrial
depolarization. to test this hypothesis, h9c2 cells were preexposed for 1 h to  xxxd2215xxx  before treatment with 100 ␮m
 xxxd1868xxx . when compared with no preexposure,  xxxd2215xxx  treatment prevented the  xxxd1868xxx -induced loss of
⌬␺m, as indicated by stable jc-1 red fluorescence intensity
measured with flow cytometry (fig. 7a);  xxxd2215xxx  alone
had no effect on ⌬␺m.  xxxd2215xxx  pretreatment also
blocked  xxxd1868xxx ’s time-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial atpase activity, assessed in homogenates made at ph 7.0

sured after sonication at ph 7.0 to the value of the activity of
if1-free enzyme. with respect to the 20% inhibition of the
atpase activity of f0f1 atp synthase observed in nontreated
cells during  xxxd1868xxx  treatment, we calculated 41% of if1inhibited enzyme ( xxxd1891xxx  and 20 min), which then returned to
20% at 30 min (fig. 4b).
to determine whether the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  involved
uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, we assayed the cnsensitive o2 consumption of intact suspended h9c2 cells.

the rcr [1.8 (sd 0.2)], that the measurements were typical of
intact (nonpermeabilized) cells. with the consideration that

(fig. 7b). thus, when mitokatp channels are blocked,  xxxd1868xxx  is unable to transiently induce mitochondrial depolarization
and inhibit atpase.
we further compared mitochondrial atpase activity in
homogenates prepared at ph 7.0 and ph 9.2 from cells
subjected to various pharmacological treatments (fig. 8).
figure 8a demonstrates that, as already shown, atpase
activity from control and  xxxd1868xxx -treated cells was ⬃20%
higher (p ⬍ 0.05) in homogenates made at ph 9.2 than at ph
7.0, because of alkaline stripping of if1. pretreatment with
 xxxd2215xxx  blocked the inhibitory effects of  xxxd1868xxx  in
homogenates prepared at physiological ph and did not alter
the limited increase in atpase activity observed at ph 9.2.
this result suggests that  xxxd1868xxx  treatment altered if1
release from atp synthase at alkaline ph, irrespective of
the effects elicited on ⌬␺m. when the experiments were
repeated in presence of 25 ␮m fccp (fig. 8b), we again
observed fccp inhibition of atpase in ph 7.0 homogenates but full recovery of atpase activity in ph 9.2 homogajp-heart circ physiol • vol

enates; these results were not altered by pretreatment with
 xxxd2215xxx , indicating that fccp uncoupling stimulated
if1-mediated atpase inhibition independently of the state
of mitokatp channels. when cells were treated with both
 xxxd1868xxx  and fccp, there was no additive inhibitory effect
on atpase assessed in ph 7.0 homogenates, likely because
of limited if1 availability, and the recovery of atpase
activity in alkaline homogenates was only partial (as observed with  xxxd1868xxx  alone). finally, when cells were
treated with both  xxxd1868xxx  and fccp after preexposure to
 xxxd2215xxx , atpase activity in ph 7.0 homogenates was
reduced to the same extent as without  xxxd2215xxx , indicating that the inhibition was due to fccp uncoupling rather
than to  xxxd1868xxx . however, when these triply treated cells
were homogenized at ph 9.2 to strip bound if1, there was
only modest recovery of atpase, attributable to the inhibitory effects of  xxxd1868xxx . notably, in all four diazoxidetreated samples, atpase activity measured after alkaline
stripping of if1 was significantly lower than that in the

such activity compared with the respective non-fccp controls (fig. 8). these results show that, even in presence of a
 xxxg1253xxx  blocker,  xxxd1868xxx  interfered with alkaline
release of if1 from f0f1 atp synthase. furthermore,  xxxd1868xxx  had this effect even when if1 binding was increased

because an improved mitochondrial energy state is recognized to play an important role in the biochemical mechanisms
of ipc and pharmacological preconditioning (2, 24, 43, 55), we
used cultured rat h9c2 myoblasts to characterize the effects
elicited by  xxxd1868xxx  on mitochondrial f0f1 atp synthase in
intact cells. in this model system, under normoxic conditions,
 xxxd1868xxx  inhibited the atpase activity of f0f1 atp synthase
in a transient manner, with a maximal effect of 26% at 100
␮m. this effect of  xxxd1868xxx  coincided with a transient and
mild mitochondria uncoupling and membrane depolarization
but was achieved without reducing atp synthesis flux or
cellular atp content. concerning atp synthesis flux, the
limitation of the experimental setup consisting of the fact that
oligomycin increases proton motive force by inhibiting its
dissipation by atp synthesis as well as proton leak proportionally should be considered. nevertheless, because  xxxd1868xxx 
had no effect on oligomycin sensitivity of basal respiration, we
can expect that the limitation was common to both control and
 xxxd1868xxx -treated cells, thus not altering the finding that atp
synthesis rate was not affected by  xxxd1868xxx . our finding are
consistent with those of fryer et al. (17), who found that the
rate of atp synthesis in isolated mitochondria of diazoxidetreated heart was not affected by the drug. furthermore, the
unaltered atp levels were in accordance. the mitochondrial
effects of  xxxd1868xxx  were blocked by pretreating cells with
 xxxd2215xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  blocker. however, even in the
presence of  xxxd2215xxx  or fccp (which strongly uncouples
and depolarizes mitochondria), the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  was
observed as a lower atpase activity in homogenates prepared
by sonication at ph 9.2 (i.e., by an effective way of releasing
bound if1). these results suggest that  xxxd1868xxx  elicits its
effects through interference with if1 binding and/or release,
although other ph-dependent pharmacological effects of the
drug cannot be ruled out. moreover, these results are consistent
with a dual effect of  xxxd1868xxx  leading to atpase inhibition: by
mildly uncoupling and depolarizing mitochondria,  xxxd1868xxx 
indirectly favors binding of if1 to f0f1 atp synthase and
thereby inhibits atpase activity; in addition,  xxxd1868xxx  directly alters if1 binding/release to/from f0f1 atp synthase, as
if1 alkaline stripping is less effective. this is in accordance
with our previous report (9), in which we described a lower kd
value of if1 binding to purified f1 in the presence of  xxxd1868xxx ,

phoric” effect of the drug (23, 27, 38, 39). unfortunately, we
do not know whether or not k⫹ cycling contributes to the
uncoupling and mitochondrial depolarization elicited by  xxxd1868xxx  in our conditions. we did not perform experiments
addressing this question, considering that a number of side
effects, possibly occurring by culturing cells under conditions
of low k⫹ concentration, may challenge data reliability in
intact cells. on the other hand, with regard to the effect
afforded by  xxxd1868xxx  on f0f1 atp synthase and promoting
if1 binding to the enzyme, in our previous paper (9) we
reported experiments run with isolated membrane-bound enzyme and documented that if1 binding to submitochondrial
particles was similarly affected by  xxxd1868xxx  in both the absence and the presence of 75 mm k2so4. thus we may suggest
that in cells the effect altering the steady state of if1 binding/
release to/from the enzyme was also afforded by  xxxd1868xxx 
independently of k⫹ cycling. conversely, the effect inducing
if1 binding and mediated by mitochondrial depolarization
possibly depended on energy-diverting k⫹/h⫹ cycling. in the
resting state of our cells, in which o2 consumption is low and
⌬␺m is high, concomitant with the effects observed by us (i.e.,
mild loss of ⌬␺m and inhibition of atpase activity mediated
by if1 binding), a modest increase of mitochondrial k⫹ influx
and matrix expansion may be caused by  xxxd1868xxx , as suggested by garlid and coworkers (11, 15, 19, 20). in this
hypothesis, the induction of if1 binding to atp synthase
consequent to mild loss of ⌬␺m afforded by  xxxd1868xxx  may be
an additional molecular consequence of mitokatp channel
opening, besides preservation of mitochondrial intermembrane
architecture and of the normal low outer membrane permeability to adp/atp (15). our data concerning the protective effect
of  xxxd2215xxx  may prompt us to conclude, within a pharmacological approach, that this was the case. nevertheless,
metabolic effects of  xxxd2215xxx  not related to the activity of
specific katp channels have been reported (23) and must be
considered, together with the finding that the sensitivity of
mitochondrial na⫹ and k⫹ channels to  xxxd2215xxx  critically depends on factors such as mg2⫹, atp, and gtp concentrations (29, 50).
although mitokatp channels have been implicated in most
studies regarding ipc and pharmacological preconditioning,
there is no conclusive molecular evidence for their existence
and no definitive information regarding structural properties.
studies in which mitokatp channels are pharmacologically
manipulated, including the present study, must be interpreted
with caution because of the multiple metabolic effects of drugs
active at these potassium channels. as already mentioned,
besides the actions on atpase reported here and by others (2,
6, 55) and those on succinate dehydrogenase (22, 48),  xxxd1868xxx  also acts as a protonophoric uncoupler (26, 27, 33) and
inhibits other nucleotide-requiring cellular atpases (16). furthermore,  xxxd2215xxx  reduces fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase (35) and blocks atp-binding cassette transporters (42) and chloride channels (56);
whether these actions, other than  xxxg1253xxx  inhibitors, play
a role in its ability to block  xxxd1868xxx -induced preconditioning
remains to be tested. drug potency and targets may be critically dependent on the metabolic state of the cells and on the
experimental conditions chosen (29).
as reported by many authors (2, 6, 24, 55), we believe that
reducing atp hydrolysis rate in ischemia is a fundamental

although it did not influence the energization-dependent if1
release. the selective action of  xxxd1868xxx , inhibiting the hydrolase but not the synthase activity of f0f1 atp synthase,
may be responsible for the beneficial effects of pharmacological preconditioning on bioenergetics and cell survival during
ischemia-reperfusion. a similar action has been reported by
grover et al. (21) for a series of selective atpase inhibitors.
in the cell system investigated here, the maximal effect of
 xxxd1868xxx  on f0f1 atp synthase was observed at 100 ␮m, a
relatively high concentration but nonetheless within the pharmacological range. although some effects have been observed
at lower concentrations (18, 39), other authors have also used
100 ␮m (1, 22). to our knowledge, no authors have measured
cell-associated concentrations of  xxxd1868xxx , which may vary in
different cells depending on the efficiency of drug-extruding
machinery. when h9c2 cells were exposed to 100 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx , the cell-associated drug concentrations were 30 – 40 ␮m
over 30 min. therefore, in the experiments reported here, low
intracellular concentrations of  xxxd1868xxx  should have helped
avoid undesired effects such as succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (22, 48).
our results regarding the ability of if1 in inhibiting atpase
activity in rat cells in response to stimuli (i.e.,  xxxd1868xxx 
exposure) are in agreement with those of das (13) and hassinen et al. (24), who observed in hearts of small rodents
if1-dependent inhibition of atpase during ischemia and ipc;
conversely, rouslin and broge (46) reported no significant
inhibition. the low level (20%) of bound if1 observed in h9c2
cells under normoxic, physiological conditions is in accordance with schwerzmann and pedersen (49) and rouslin (45),
who both reported a 0.2 ratio of bound if1 to catalytic sector f1
in rat. finally, the modest mitochondrial uncoupling achieved
with  xxxd1868xxx  in h9c2 cells is similar to that reported by
minners et al. (38, 39), who indicated properly in a modest
uncoupling the cellular response of preconditioning-mediated
cardioprotection. the mechanism by which uncoupling of
oxidative phosphorylation in preconditioning results in a beneficial adaptive mitochondrial response to cellular stress has
not been established yet. it may include reduction of excessive
reactive oxygen species generation in the contest of ischemia
(41), uncoupling-induced augmentation of glucose uptake (31),
and preservation of mitochondrial calcium overload (26). inhibition of atpase activity of f0f1 atp synthase, due to the
dual effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on if1 binding documented here, may
be central to the adaptive response by attenuating atp depletion. it should be emphasized that  xxxd1868xxx  elicited decrease
of ⌬␺m and enhancement of respiration, but not decrease of
mitochondrial atp synthesis and enhancement of atp hydrolysis. therefore,  xxxd1868xxx  cannot be considered to act as a
“conventional protonophore” under the experimental conditions we used, although we cannot exclude such an effect on a
different timescale. we can speculate that the expected increase of atp hydrolysis may be counteracted by the effect
altering the steady state of if1 binding/release to/from the f0f1
atp synthase that  xxxd1868xxx  afforded concomitantly, resulting
in promotion of if1 binding and inhibition of atpase activity.
conversely, at present we do not have a clear explanation for
the finding that the expected decrease in atp synthesis flux
was undetectable.
 xxxd1868xxx  uncoupling may be due to k⫹ influx induced by
the opening of mitokatp channels and/or to the “protono-

aspect of cardioprotection. in our opinion, both the mechanism
documented by garlid and coworkers and that suggested by us
and involving a dual effect on atp synthase may contribute to
 xxxd1868xxx -mediated reduction of energy waste. we therefore
speculate that the modest dissipation of ⌬␺m caused by  xxxd1868xxx  in the resting state of our cells, whether mediated by
mitokatp channels or by other mechanisms, could be sufficient
to induce if1 binding to atp synthase, thereby inhibiting atp
hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme but not atp synthesis.
therefore, mild uncoupling and the dual effect on atp synthase documented by us during normoxia may represent important effects helping in the search for the mechanisms, still
unknown, by which  xxxd1868xxx  confers cardioprotection during
ischemia.
in conclusion, we observed that in normoxic intact cells,
 xxxd1868xxx  has a dual effect on mitochondrial atp synthase that
can be summarized as follows.  xxxd1868xxx -triggered mitochondrial uncoupling and depolarization inhibit atpase activity by
promoting binding with the membrane potential-sensitive inhibitor if1. concomitantly,  xxxd1868xxx  interferes with the binding/release of if1 to/from the enzyme, further enhancing the
inhibition. the transient nature of  xxxd1868xxx  effects we observed remains to be explained. nevertheless, the finding that
cell-associated drug concentration significantly varies over the
same timescale and parallels such effects may suggest a threshold effect of the drug concentration, which appeared to diminish to the initial value at 30 min as a likely consequence of high
efficiency of drug-extruding machinery. furthermore, it should
be emphasized that in fully energized mitochondria diazoxideinduced reduction of ⌬␺m likely has a relatively small and
transient effect, whereas under conditions of metabolic stress
relatively small decreases in ⌬␺m can translate into large
decreases of matrix ca2⫹ and large changes in the functional
state of mitochondria and specifically of atpase/synthase.
under such conditions  xxxd1868xxx  effects may be thus amplified
and made longlasting. it is also possible that a deeper investigation of the actual relevance of energy-diverting k⫹/h⫹
cycling as a mechanism of the effects documented here (as
discussed above) may provide a contribution to the explanation
of their transient nature. the biological relevance of these
results versus cardioprotection needs further in vivo investigation.
