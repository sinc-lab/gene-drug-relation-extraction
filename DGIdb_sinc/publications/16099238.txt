resistance to thyroid hormone harboring a commonly
occurring mutation in the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  ␤
gene (p453t)

resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a dominantly inherited syndrome of reduced
tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone (th) usually due to mutations in the th
receptor ␤ gene (tr␤). we studied pituitary and peripheral tissue responses to
graded doses of liothyronine (l-t3) in 5 affected members (2 children and 3 adults)
of a family with rth due to the common tr␤ mutation p453t. overall, the 5 subjects
studied exhibited suppressed  xxxd3368xxx  response to  xxxg2328xxx  of 51% ⴞ 8%, 12.1% ⴞ 1.5%, and 6.3% ⴞ 3% of the 100% baseline on 50, 100,
and 200 ␮g/dl l-t3, respectively. this degree of suppression was greater than that
observed in subjects with rth due to other tr␤ mutations, indicating less resistance.
compared with normal subjects, however, the family described here demonstrated
less suppression by l-t3, compatible with their rth, although of a mild magnitude.
the 2 children with rth demonstrated less l-t3–mediated suppression of prolactin
and cholesterol than the adults. patients often receive thyroid ablative therapy
before the diagnosis of rth and are left with variable degrees of hypothyroidism.
our results demonstrate that graded doses of l-t3 can be used to evaluate rth
patients, even under the condition of limited thyroid reserve, when results are
compared with their baseline. we demonstrate that rth patients can be evaluated
either on or off thyroid hormone and still be distinguished from hypothyroid subjects
without rth. (j lab clin med 2005;146:85–94)

incidence has been estimated to be 1 case per 40,000 –
50,000 live births.2,3 the molecular basis for the syndrome in most patients is mutations localized to the ligand-binding domain (lbd) and adjacent hinge region of
the th receptor ␤ gene (tr␤).4 – 6
the severity of reduced th sensitivity ranges from
clinically asymptomatic and euthyroid to variable stigmata compatible with thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. this variation is likely due to the magnitude of
functional impairment of the mutant tr␤ and the relative level of tissue expression of the mutant tr␤ and
other unidentified cofactors. some rth subjects may
exhibit symptoms and signs of th deficiency in 1 tissue
while manifesting findings of thyrotoxicosis in another
tissue. reports of subjects with rth usually describe
the molecular basis for the condition and the thyroid
function tests as a reflection of the sensitivity of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis to th feedback.
there is a paucity of data on pituitary and peripheral
tissue action of th in multiple subjects with an identical mutation. furthermore, the ability to assess rth
by a challenge with th in subjects with limited thyroidal reserve has not been evaluated.
we report a large family with rth caused by a
single nucleotide change in exon 10 of the tr␤ gene
resulting in the substitution of threonine for proline at
codon 453 (the p453t mutation). this is a relatively
common tr␤ gene mutation that has been previously
described in 8 families4,7–16 and characterized extensively in vitro. the purpose of this study was to compare patterns of th responsiveness of individuals harboring the same mutation within the same kindred. the
opportunity to study several subjects with identical
mutations and similar genetic backgrounds but differ-

ent thyroidal reserve due to previous ablative treatment
provided the opportunity to evaluate the validity of a
standard protocol applied to various baseline thyroid
states.
patients and methods
patients. the propositus was a 5-year-old male (iv-1) (fig
1) who presented in 2003 with significant asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and a history of recurrent episodes of otitis media. he
was hyperactive and had a short attention span, as well as a
small goiter. thyroid function tests demonstrated elevated
serum free t4 and t3 levels and tsh concentration at the
upper limit of normal.
other affected family members included the mother (iii-6)
and maternal grandmother (ii-6) of the propositus. iii-6 was
a 29-year-old female noted to have abnormal thyroid function
tests as a teenager. she was subsequently started on levothyroxine (l-t4) therapy by her outside physician for presumed
hypothyroidism secondary to autoimmune thyroid disease.
on presentation to us, she was taking 175 ␮g l-t4 daily, as
well as oral contraceptive pills. her medical history was
significant for allergic rhinitis. she had a heteroechogenic
thyroid gland that was twice the normal size.
ii-6 was a 48-year-old female, mother of iii-6 and grandmother of iv-1. she was treated with 131i several years ago
for presumed hyperthyroidism. he medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. she denied any
significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
on presentation, she was taking 75 ␮g liothyronine (l-t3)
daily, as well as antihypertensive agents and inhaled steroids
for asthma. her thyroid gland was heteroechogenic and of
twice-normal size.
a 30-year-old male (iii-9), a first cousin of iii-6, was
found to have abnormal thyroid function tests as a teenager.
his test abnormalities were interpreted as graves’ disease,

prompting treatment with 131i. at the time of presentation to
us, he was taking 300 ␮g l-t4 daily. his medical history was
significant for hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, and anxiety. on review of systems, he complained of
occasional palpitations, panic symptoms, anxiety, hyperactivity, inability to concentrate, and insomnia. his thyroid gland
was of normal size. his social history was remarkable for
unemployment for several years.
subject iv-3 was a 5-year-old female, daughter of iii-9.
she had an unremarkable developmental history but was
noted to have abnormal thyroid function tests by her pediatrician. tests were obtained because of thyroid disease in her
cousin (iv-1) and signs of attention deficit and hyperactivity.
she was noted to have a small goiter.
subjects of kindred mgg were studied in comparison to 3
other groups previously reported by our laboratory.17 three
groups of control subjects were evaluated: (1) a group of 6
euthyroid adults age 22–50 years with serum tsh in the
normal range, (2) a group of 7 adult hypothyroid subjects with
elevated serum tsh, and (3) a group of 5 rth subjects in
whom 4 subjects harbored tr␤ mutations (p453s, r338w,
g345r) and 1 subject had non-tr rth.
clinical studies. five members of the kindred mgg, spanning 3 generations (iii-9, iv-3, iv-1, iii-6, and ii-6) (fig 1),
underwent in vivo testing involving the administration of
increasing doses of l-t3. trh tests were performed before
and after each dose of l-t3 to evaluate the extent of pituitary
resistance to th. all subjects discontinued thyroid medication for 3 weeks before admission to the general clinical
research center (gcrc). the rationale for stopping the
thyroid medications was to observe the effect of standard
graded doses of l-t3 that would result in comparable serum
t3 levels in all subjects. the main pitfall to this approach is
that each subject with a history of previous treatment was
variably hypothyroid at the time of the study compared with
the untreated children. however, based on previously published studies, the elevated baseline tsh levels in the adults
should not blunt the incremental increase in tsh with trh
compared with that in the children, as we discuss later in this
article.18 –20 in addition to kindred mgg, 6 euthyroid, 7 hypothyroid, and 5 rth adults who were all adults, unrelated to
kindred mgg, and off treatment were studied under the same
protocol to provide normative and rth control data.
before admission to the gcrc at the university of chicago, the subjects were interviewed to obtain a detailed history of activity and dietary habits. total calorie intake and
content (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) were calculated,
and an equivalent diet schedule was applied for the entire
11-day study period. daily morning basal metabolic rate
(bmr) was measured in the adult patients using the medgem
calorimeter (healthetech, golden, col).21 sleeping pulse (at
4 am) was monitored daily. results for bmr and sleeping
pulse were averaged for 3 days on each dose and compared
with the single baseline measurement obtained on the  xxxd2476xxx  admission to the gcrc. baseline blood tests and the
trh test were done in the morning of the second day. the
first dose of l-t3 was given at 8 pm on the second day, and

this was continued for 3 days (6 doses). the second trh test
was performed with the sixth dose of l-t3 on day 5. the
same cycle was repeated with the 2 subsequent incremental
doses of l-t3, with blood and trh testing done on days 8
and 11.
the incremental doses of l-t3 given to the adults were 50,
100, and 200 ␮g/day for 3 consecutive days in a split dose
every 12 hours (8 am and 8 pm), for a total of 6 doses per
incremental dose. for the 2 children under age 15 years (iv-1
and iv-3) the incremental l-t3 doses given were 25, 50, and
100 ␮g/day in split doses as for the adults. these doses
resulted in comparable serum t3 levels (fig 2). note that the
difference in the absolute serum t3 concentrations in the
normal and hypothyroid control groups is related to the
method of t3 determination, with normal ranges 30% lower
than the current assay.
the trh tests were performed on days 2, 5, 8, and 11. in
these tests, 100 ␮g of trh (ferring, lausanne, switzerland)
was injected as a single intravenous bolus given 30 min after
the first blood sample was obtained (⫺30 min), 15 min after
administration of the last incremental dose of l-t3 and just
before collection of the 0-min blood sample. blood samples
were collected at ⫺30, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240
min for measurement of tsh, total t3 (tt3), and prolactin
(prl). total t4 (tt4), free t4 index (ft4i), and thyroglobulin were also measured in the sample obtained 180 min after
trh administration.
from the blood samples obtained at ⫺30 min, the following determinations were also obtained: cholesterol, creatine
kinase (ck), ferritin,  xxxg2066xxx  (shbg),
thyroglobulin, tt4, ft4i, and reverse t3.
the institutional review board and the gcrc at the
university of chicago approved this protocol. informed consents were obtained from all participants in the study. the
research conforms to the principles of the declaration of
helsinki.
thyroid function testing and clinical assays. thyroid
function tests were obtained in all members of the family who
were available. these tests were performed while subjects
were taking their medications as indicated (table i). serum
tsh, total tt4, tt3, and prl were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (roche boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, ind). ft4i was calculated as the product
of tt4 and t4 resin uptake ratio. shbg was measured by
competitive protein binding assay.22 the normal ranges are
given in table i. cholesterol, ck, and ferritin were measured
in the hospital clinical chemistry laboratory by automated
assays.
dna isolation and tr␤ amplification and sequencing. genomic dna was extracted from circulating white blood

cells of 19 family members and used for direct sequencing of the
tr␤ gene. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of the
last 3 coding exons (8, 9, and 10) of tr␤ was carried out using
100 ng of genomic dna as the template and 10 pmol each of an
appropriate pair of primers, as described previously.9 the first
denaturation was at 94°c for 3 min, followed by 35 denaturation
cycles of 1 min at 94°c, 1 min of annealing at 55°c, and 1 min
of extension at 72°c. the final extension was for 5 min at 72°c.

tive to repeated-measures analysis of variance and was used
because of the small sample size. this method of analysis was
used in a previous study evaluating the tsh and prl responses to trh.17
friedman’s test was also used to determine whether significant changes occurred in the peripheral markers between
l-t3 doses. the small sample sizes in this study limited the
use of statistical analysis to evaluate differences between
groups and among family members. therefore, peripheral
tissue marker responses to l-t3 were also expressed descriptively as percent change relative to baseline and plotted
against the individual’s free t3 index (ft3i) measured in the
serum sample. for bmr and pulse data, student t-tests were
used to determine whether differences existed between
groups. results of hypothyroid subjects were not available for
bmr and pulse.
results
tr␤ gene sequencing and genotyping. the coding region for the lbd of the tr␤ was sequenced, and a
single base substitution was found at the tr␤1 cdna
nucleotide position 1642 in exon 10, where a cytosine
was replaced by an adenine. this results in substitution
of the normal proline (cct) in codon 453 with a
threonine (act). this mutation creates a new xcm1
restriction site. when the amplified pcr fragment containing the a1642 is cut by xcm1, 3 fragments of size
421, 288, and 133 bp are produced. the mutation
producing tr␤ p453t was thus identified in 1 allele of
8 of the 19 family members tested.
effect of l-t3 on the pituitary. the baseline tsh response to trh varied among the 5 subjects. the 3 adult
subjects had higher absolute peak tsh values, in agreement with their higher basal tsh values. this was
expected for the 3 adults who were hypothyroid due to
either previous treatment with 131i (subjects ii-6 and
iii-9) or concomitant autoimmune thyroid disease (subject iii-6).
the effect of graded doses of l-t3 on the tsh
response to trh was also studied in the 5 affected
subjects. aucs were calculated for each subject at each
dose of t3. aucs for the 3 different doses were sig-

nificantly different (p ⬍ .01; friedman’s test), with
higher doses leading to smaller aucs. this was true
for all 5 patients (table ii). these data were also
compared with that obtained previously by us from 5
subjects in 4 families with rth as well as 13 nonresistant subjects who were either euthyroid or hypothyroid.17 the mean auc was expressed as percent basal
tsh secretion. among the 2 nonresistant groups,
whether euthyroid or hypothyroid, no significant differences were seen in the tsh response to trh with 100
or 200 ␮g of l-t3. however, at 100 ␮g l-t3, kindred
mgg was suppressed to 12.1% ⫾ 0.2%. this degree of
suppression is significantly less than that in the normal
and hypothyroid groups (4.1% ⫾ 1.0% and 6.0% ⫾
3.0%, respectively) but is similar to that in the rth
group (19.8% ⫾ 4.3%) [fig 3(a)].
effect of graded doses of l-t3 on prl responses to
trh was also evaluated [fig 3(b)]. prl response
reflects the effects of tr␤ mutations on another pituitary cell type, the lactotroph. prl secretion is stimulated by trh, and its response is suppressed by th.
thus, in resistant patients there is less suppression and
an overall higher prl response to exogenous trh. in
contrast, normal non-rth individuals have appropriate
suppression and decreasing of prl secretion with increasing doses of l-t3. in this study, the adult patients
demonstrated decreasing aucs for prl response with
increasing l-t3 doses, whereas the 2 children did not
(table ii). prl secretion changed little with the increasing 3 l-t3 doses in kindred mgg, with values
compared with baseline of 91.7% ⫾ 5.8% at 50 ␮g t3,
73.4% ⫾ 6.7% at 100 ␮g t3, and 72.3% ⫾ 12.5% at
200 ␮g t3 (fig 3). in contrast, nonresistant normal
subjects demonstrated decreased prl secretion with
increasing l-t3 dose of 74% ⫾ 43% of baseline with
50 ␮g, 48% ⫾ 4% with 100 ␮g, and 18% ⫾ 6% with
200 ␮g [fig 3(b)]. the hypothyroid subjects suppressed
equally well as the euthyroid controls, and better at the
highest (200 ␮g) dose of l-t3. the lack of change in
prl response in kindred mgg compared with non-rth

effect of l-t3 on peripheral tissues. peripheral markers
of th action on the liver include those that are positively regulated by t3, such as shbg and ferritin, and
those that are negatively regulated by t3, such as cholesterol and ck (fig 4). other useful peripheral markers affected by changes in serum th levels include
body weight, bmr, and pulse. body weight tends to
decrease, bmr tends to increase, and heart rate tends to
increase with exposure to higher levels of th.
percent change from baseline was calculated for each
peripheral marker to evaluate differences between l-t3
doses. in addition, the changes in peripheral markers in
kindred mgg were compared with those in normal
euthyroid controls and rth subjects by calculating the
incremental change from baseline (fig 4). among the

positively regulated markers, changes in shbg are
significantly different than baseline (p ⬍ .05; friedman’s test), with the highest l-t3 dose leading to the
greatest increase in shbg from baseline. subjects ii-6,
iii-6, and iv-1 did show very small decreases in baseline shbg with the first 2 doses, but did increase above
baseline at the highest l-t3 dose. in contrast, no significant difference was detected in ferritin levels between l-t3 doses. the 2 children demonstrated either
small decreases or no change in ferritin levels from
baseline with all 3 doses of l-t3, whereas the adults
exhibited small increases to no change in ferritin.
among the negatively regulated markers, cholesterol
demonstrated significant differences in percent of baseline (p ⬍ .05). ck levels did not demonstrate significant changes with incremental doses of l-t3.
weight did not decrease in any of the subjects. sub-

ject iv-3 actually demonstrated weight gain at all l-t3

were observed in the subjects during the course of the
study, the increase in bmr was similar to that observed
in normal subjects on the highest dose of l-t3 (133%
⫾ 1.7% in kindred mgg and 132% ⫾ 9% in normal
subjects) compared with other rth subjects who demonstrated no change in bmr with l-t3 administration
(fig 5). pulse rate among family members did significantly increase with incremental doses of l-t3. the
increase in pulse from baseline at the highest dose of
l-t3 in kindred mgg (93% ⫾ 14%) was similar to that
in other rth subjects (104% ⫾ 9%) but significantly
less than that in normal subjects (137% ⫾ 17%) (fig 5).
discussion

the main goal of this study was to evaluate pituitary
and peripheral tissue responses in a kindred with the
same mutation, to control as much as possible for
genetic variables and to determine whether there is
heterogeneous resistance to th. in addition, using hy-

pothyroid subjects without resistance, we wished to
determine whether standard l-t3 suppression protocol
could identify rth in subjects with limited thyroidal
reserve. we evaluated the responses of tsh and prl
to trh stimulation during administration of graded
doses of l-t3. subjects with rth do not suppress tsh
response to trh to the same degree as do nonresistant
individuals; however, a dose-dependent partial suppression is generally seen in most cases. resistant individuals, particularly children, demonstrated little to no
dose-dependent changes in the prl response to trh,
whereas nonresistant subjects exhibited significant suppression with increasing l-t3 doses. the relative
changes in tsh were not affected by age or by preexisting hypothyroidism.
the degree of th resistance in younger subjects with
rth appears to be out of proportion to the generally
higher levels of tt4 and tt3 in unaffected normal
children. the mild degree of th resistance seen in the
affected subjects of the current family with the p453t
mutation is confirmed by the sensitivity to suppression

with l-t3. this mild resistance to th is likely due to
the modestly reduced affinity of the mutant tr␤ for t3,
which has been measured between 0.29,10 and 0.44,7 (ka
mutant/ka wild-type tr␤).
prl response in the affected family members decreased less with incremental doses of l-t3, in contrast
to t3 dose-dependent suppression of trh-induced
prl secretion seen in nonresistant subjects. trh stimulation of prl after suppression by l-t3 was less
suppressed in the 2 children than in the 3 adults with
rth. this indicates age-related differences in pituitary
lactotroph sensitivity to th that is more apparent in the
subjects with rth.
the tr␤ p453t mutation has been previously described in 8 unrelated families with rth (table
iii).4,7,9 –16 heterogeneity in th levels exists among these
kindreds, despite identical mutations. tsh was within the
normal range in all cases, but free t3 varied from 117% to
195% the upper limit of normal and free t4 varied from

j lab clin med

124% to 586% the upper limit of normal. a review of the
different cases revealed no obvious age-related differences. most affected subjects had goiters. resting pulse
rates varied, although heart rates were generally higher in
the younger subjects. as expected, attention deficit disorder was present in 2 families, and “nervousness” was
noted in the propositus of another. detailed clinical data
were not available for several of these kindreds. the
family presented herein had similar thyroid function tests
and clinical symptoms as those previously reported in
other families with the same mutation. detailed in vivo
studies of peripheral markers during th administration
were not performed in any of the studies and thus are not
available for comparison.
heterogeneity in the responses of the pituitary and
peripheral tissues in subjects with rth harboring the
same mutation have been described previously. classification of rth based on the presence or absence of signs
of hyperthyroidism led to assigning 2 phenotypes to rth:
generalized resistance to th ( xxxg2284xxx ) and pituitary resistance to th ( xxxg2284xxx ). but rth subjects with identical
mutations (r320l, r338w, and r429q) were classified
as both  xxxg2284xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx .9 this suggests that  xxxg2284xxx  and
 xxxg2284xxx  represent parts of the variable clinical spectrum of
a single genetic entity. furthermore, responses of negatively th-regulated markers, such as cholesterol and ck,
were more variable than positively th-regulated markers
and showed distinct differences between affected members of the same family.23 two members of family f51
were children, age 2.5 and 6.5 years, with a point mutation
i431t. one of these children showed a paradoxical increase in ck and normal suppression of cholesterol in
response to l-t3, whereas the other demonstrated a
blunted response of cholesterol and a normal response of
ck to l-t3.23 this heterogeneity was also seen in the
currently reported family primarily in pituitary prl responses to trh. with regard to peripheral tissue responses to th, only a few differences were seen among
family members. these differences occurred in the responses of the negatively regulated markers, cholesterol
and ck.
shbg, ferritin, cholesterol, and cpk are dependent on
liver function, because the liver is the site of synthesis
and/or degradation of these substances. liver function is
principally tr␤ dependent. heart rate and metabolism
have a major tr␣ dependency. however, the expression
of a dominant negative mutant tr␤, even in small
amounts, can reduce the effect of th in these tissues.
the 3 adult subjects of the kindred mgg showed a
normal increment of bmr; the children could not be
tested. the increase in bmr could be due to reversal of
hypothyroidism being so different than in the other
rth patients. alternatively, the bmr may be related

to the mild rth and its primary dependence on th
action mediated through tr␣.
we have demonstrated that rth patients can be
evaluated either on or off th and still be distinguished
from hypothyroid subjects without rth. this is an
important finding for clinicians evaluating subjects
with rth, because most of these patients often have
had previous treatment aimed at reducing th levels
leaving the subjects with limited thyroid reserve.
we thank dr. neal scherberg for thyroid function test assays and
the nursing, nutrition, lab and statistical cores of the general
clinical research center, without whom this research would not be
possible. we also thank the patients who participated and the referring physician, dr. l. pardo.
