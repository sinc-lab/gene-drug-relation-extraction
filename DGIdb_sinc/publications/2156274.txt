behav 35(1) 99-103, 1990.--using the acth analog [125i-tyr23,phe2,nle4]acth(1-24), the existence of specific binding sites
for acth in atrial membrane preparations was demonstrated. the dissociation constants (kd), determined by scatchard analysis, were
not significantly different for membrane preparations of adrenal gland or atrial tissue (being 6.40 x 10-12 m and 8.86 x 10-12 m
respectively). no binding was observed to membrane preparations from kidney or lung. while the binding of the acth(1-24) analog
to atrial membranes was inhibited by acth(i-24), it was not affected by norepinephrine or epinephrine. it was proposed that the
acth(1-24) analog may bind to sites located on the adrenergic nerve endings associated with the cardiac tissue, and that such binding
would interfere with the neuronal reuptake of the catecholamines.

basse'i~, strand and cairncross (2) found that  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) induced an enhanced myocardial sensitivity
to both norepinephrine and epinephrine. while previous studies
had suggested that acth's action in this regard may be attributed
to its ability to inhibit the uptake and retention of the catecholamines by the adrenergic nerve endings (1,2), it is only recently that
such an inhibition by acth(1-24) has been confirmed in atrial
tissue (11). since acth(1-24) does inhibit neuronal uptake in rat
cardiac tissue, it is reasonable to suggest that receptors for the
peptide hormone may exist in this tissue. acth binding sites in
the rat median eminence have been localised in vivo (16). these
binding sites were localised to axon terminals in the region, and it
is possible that they may be the receptors associated with the
neuronal uptake process. outside the cns it is becoming apparent
that cells other than those in the adrenal gland can bind acth,
including adipocytes (12) and lymphocytes (9). however, so far
no specific binding sites for acth in rat cardiac tissue have been
reported.
the present study was undertaken to investigate the existence
of specific binding sites for acth(1-24) in atrial tissue of the rat
using crude membrane preparations. despite numerous attempts to
study the binding of acth to its receptors by direct binding
methods, detection and characterisation of the receptors has
proved difficur (5).
the major difficulties encountered are the extraordinary propensity of the hormone to bind to inert materials and nonreceptor
components of the target tissue, and the low biological potencies
of the radiolabelled acth preparations (5). loss of biological
potency of acth results from the introduction of an iodine atom

acth analog

into tyrosine residue in position 2 and the oxidation of the
methionine in position 4. the synthesis of an acth analog in
which the tyrosine2 in replaced by phenylalanine and the
methionine4 by  xxxd2755xxx  produces a peptide equipotent with
acth in stimulating steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cells, and
where iodination retained full biological potency (5,8). the acth
analog was used in this study.
method

animals
male csf rats, 90 ___5 days old, were used in this study. the
animals were housed in groups of 3 under conditions of constant
temperature and humidity (21 +-0.5°c, 46% humidity) and subjected to a 12-hr reversed night-day schedule (light 2000 to 0800
hr) beginning at least 14 days prior to the commencement of
experimentation. food and water were provided ad lib.

radiolabelled acth analog, [1251-tyr23,phe2,nle4]
acth(1-24)
the acth analog [phe2,nie4]acth(1-24) (australian laboratory services, sydney) was radioiodinated by the modified
chloramine t method of djura and hoskinson (6), and purified
using sep-pak reverse-phase cartridges (waters associates,
sydney); purity being confirmed using high performance liquid
chromatography (7). the specific radioactivity of the batches of
the [~25i]acth analog varied between 460 to 1420 ci/mmol.

method of durand (7). animals were killed by cervical dislocation
and exsanguinated. both adrenal glands and the atria were rapidly
dissected out, weighed and stored in liquid nitrogen. five pairs of
adrenals or 5 sets of atria were homogenised in 10 ml of 10 mm
"iris hc1 buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose at 4°c. the homogehate was first centrifuged at 4°c for 10 min at 600 x g to remove
unbroken cells and nuclei. the supernatant was then centrifuged at
20,000 x g for 30 min at 4°c. the pellet was resuspended in 6 ml
of cold 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing no sucrose. the suspension
was used as the crude membrane preparation in subsequent
studies. the protein content of the suspension was assayed using
the bio-rad microassay procedure (bio-rad, sydney, australia).
this assay is based on the method of bradford (4).

[1251]acth(1-24) analog binding assay
the assay was performed in polystyrene tubes 10 × 55 mm.
membrane preparations (200 ixl) in 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing
1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) (protein concentration; atria 0.7
mg/ml; adrenal gland 0.39 mg/ml) were incubated at 4°c with 50
p~l of [~25i]acth(1-24) analog (80,000 cpm) and 200 p,1 of 20
mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing 1% bsa for 2, 5 and 10 rain.
incubations were routinely conducted in triplicate. after the
selected incubation period, 0.5 ml of cold "iris buffer containing
0.1%  xxxd2982xxx  was added to the incubation mixture,
vortexed, then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for 10 rain at 4°c. an
aliquot of the supernatant (500 pj) was taken and counted in a
gamma counter. by subtracting the total activity in the supernatant
from the activity added, the activity of the [~25i]acth(1-24)
analog bound to the membrane preparation was obtained. this
represented the total activity bound (both specific and nonspecific
binding). nonspecific binding was assessed by replacing the 200
ixl of  xxxd3449xxx  (1% bsa) in the incubation mixture with an equal
volume of buffer containing an excess (100 ixm) unlabelled
acth(i-24) (synacthan, ciba-geigy australia ltd.).

tissue specificity in the binding of [1251]acth(1-24) analog to
membrane preparations
to determine whether the binding phenomenon was specific
for atrial and adrenal membranes, the binding of [125i]acth(124) analog to membrane preparations from several different tissues
was compared. all membrane preparations were prepared identically. incubations were carried out for 2 min, as described above,
with membranes from rat atria, adrenal glands, kidney and lung
(protein concentrations ranging from 400 to 700 p,g/ml). the
activity of [125i]acth(1-24) analog specifically bound was
determined and expressed as counts/min/mg of protein.

displacement of [12sl]acth(1-24) analog binding
since it had previously been reported that acth(1-24) would
inhibit the neuronal uptake of the catecholamines (11), the ability
of norepinephrine and epinephrine to inhibit the binding of the
[~25i]acth(1-24) analog to atrial membrane preparation was
investigated. in this series of experiments the amount of isotope
bound (total bound) was measured in the presence of increasing
concentrations of either unlabelled acth(1-24), norepinephrine,
or epinephrine. the final concentration of the inhibitor in the
incubation mixture ranged from 4.26 × 10-4 m to 4.26 × 10-7 m.
the incubation time was 2 min. the results are expressed as a
percentage of total bound in the absence of the inhibitor.

scatchard analysis of [12sl]acth(1-24) analog binding
to characterise the properties of both the adrenal and atrial

mehrabani and basset'i

binding sites, the binding of the [~25i]acth(1-24) analog to
membrane preparations was measured using variable amounts of
the radiolabelled analog. the method was essentially the same as
that described previously with the exception that membrane
preparations (200 p,l) were incubated with varying volumes of
[125i]acth(1-24) analog (7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 p,l)
together with 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx  to give a final volume of 750  xxxd1919xxx .
the ratio of bound to free [125i]acth(1-24) analog was calculated and plotted against the amount of labelled analog bound.
scatchard analysis (14) was carried out to determine the apparent
dissociation constant, ka.
the relationship between the bound/free ratio and the total
[125i]acth analog bound was found not to be linear over the
range of acth concentrations investigated (see figs. 4 and 5)
indicating at least two populations of binding sites in both adrenal
and atrial tissue. subsequent studies concentrated on the highaffinity binding sites by using only the lower concentrations of the
acth analog (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 20 pal; the final
incubation volume remaining at 750 ixl). under these conditions
binding to only a single population of binding sites was observed
on scatchard analysis.
results

the time course for the binding of [izsi]acth(1-24) analog to
both adrenal and atrial membrane preparations is shown in fig. 1.
maximum binding at 4°c with both membrane preparations
occurred within 2 min, the earliest time at which measurements
were made. this is in agreement with the observations of ways,
zimmerman and ontjes (17) who found also that maximum
binding of [~zsi]acth(1-24) to adrenal membrane preparation at
4°c occurred within 2 min. with atrial membrane there was no
significant change in binding over the time period studied (unpaired t-test, p>0.05). however, with adrenal membranes, total
binding declined slowly, so that by 10 min incubation the total
binding was significantly less than at either 2 or 5 min (unpaired
t-tests, p<0.05 in both cases). while, with the present data, it is
not possible to say why binding to the adrenal membrane declined
with time, a similar observation has been reported by saez et al.
(13). saez suggested that the decline could be due to either
degradation of the ligand or a denaturation of the receptor. a
similar pattern was seen if the percentage of [~zsi]acth(i-24)
analog specifically bound to the membrane preparations was
plotted against time.
through this series of experiments the percentage of the
[~25i]acth(1-24) analog bound to membrane preparations was
68.8 - 0.1% (mean ~ s.e.m.), of which 48.6 ---0.4% was specifically bound. the ratio of specifically bound to total bound did not
vary significantly throughout these experiments, and there was no
significant difference between atrial and adrenal preparations in
terms of the percentage total bound or the percentage specifically
bound.
the binding of [125i]acth(1-24) analog to membrane preparations from a number of tissues is shown in fig. 2. the results
are expressed as the activity of the labelled analog specifically
bound to the membrane preparation per mg of protein in the
incubation tube. although the adrenal and nonadrenal tissues all
showed some nonspecific binding of the radiolabelled analog, only
the adrenal and atrial preparations showed any appreciable binding
which was displaceable with unlabelled acth(1-24). both kidney and lung tissue showed little specific binding of [ ~25i]acth(124) analog. the [125i] analog specifically bound/mg protein was
significantly greater in the adrenal tissue when compared to atrial
tissue (unpaired t-test, p<0.001).

analog was reduced to 46.7% of the total isotope bound in the
absence of inhibitor. this observation is in close agreement with
the finding reported earlier that an excess of unlabelled acth(124) (100 o,m) will inhibit the specific binding of the labelled
analog and that the percentage of the total bound isotope specifi-

cally bound was 48.6%. the catecholamines, norepinephrine and
epinephrine did not significantly alter the binding of the
[t2si]acth(1-24) analog to atrial membrane preparations over
the dose range studied, 4.26 x 10 - 7 m to 4.26 × 10-4 [one-way
analysis of variance; norepinephrine, f(5,12) = 2.85, p>0.05;
epinephrine, f(5,12) = 1.06, p>0.05].
a scatchard plot of the binding of [~25i]acth(1-24) analog to
atrial tissue is shown in fig. 4, and to adrenal tissue in fig. 5. in
both cases the relationship between the bound/free ratio and total
acth analog bound is not linear over the range of acth analog
concentrations examined, indicating at least two populations of
binding sites. in order to investigate the high-affinity binding sites
in both tissues, we subsequently concentrated on the binding at
lower concentrations of the [125i]acth(1-24) analog. these
concentrations corresponded to the initial steep portions of the
scatchard plots shown in fig. 4 and 5. on the basis of these
studies the mean ( ± s.e.m.) k d for the atrial membrane (n =5)
was found to be 8.25_+0.98×10 -~2 m, and for the adrenal
membranes ( n = 5 ) 6.57±0.51 × i0 -~2 m. an unpaired t-test
showed no significant difference between these two values
(p>0.05).

rations obtained from adrenal and atrial tissue. little binding was
observed to membrane preparations obtained from kidney or lung
tissue. ways, zimmerman and ontjes (17) also demonstrated the
absence of acth(1-24) binding sites in kidney, lung and liver
preparations.
the present study does not determine on which cell type in the
atrium the acth receptors are located. it is known that acth
alone does not affect the mechanical characteristics of the heart
(15). the positive inotropism induced by acth is dependent
upon the release of endogenous norepinephrine (15), or the
administration of exogenous norepinephrine (2,19).
investigating the possible mechanisms by which acth may
exert its affect on atrial tissue, zeiler e t al. (19) proposed that
acth may affect atrial contractility by a direct action on the
cardiac muscle itself. they suggested that while acth does not
appear to affect cardiac  xxxd1773xxx  directly, it may affect other
components of the chain of intracellular reactions triggered by
 xxxd1773xxx . on the other hand, mehrabani and bassett (11)
reported that acth(1-24) inhibited the neuronal reuptake of
norepinephrine in cardiac tissue, and proposed that the acthinduced potentiation of the inotropic actions of the catecholamines
(2) was due to such an inhibition of reuptake. if this were the case
then the acth binding sites in cardiac tissue may be located on
the adrenergic nerve terminals associated with the cardiac tissue,
and not on the heart muscle itself. in the median eminence acth
binding sites have been localised to axon terminals in the region
(16), and such receptors may be associated with the adrenergic
uptake process.
it is of interest to note that while acth(1-24) inhibits the
neuronal uptake of the catecholamines (11), the catecholamines do
not appear to interfere with the binding of acth in cardiac tissue.
recent studies have shown the  xxxg1385xxx  to be a complex
structure. in the mouse adrenal tumor it is composed of 4 separate
protein subunits, the ability to specifically bind [~25i]acth being
localised to only one of these subunits (3).
studies of the structure-activity relationship of acth in

discussion

while previous studies have indicated the possible importance
of acth as a modulator of catecholamine activity in cardiac
tissue (1, 11, 15), there have been few reports suggesting the
existence of specific acth receptors in such tissue. the evidence
for acth receptors in the heart has generally been indirect,
involving studies utilizing cholinergic and adrenergic stimulation
and blockade (15). zeiler, strand and e1-sherif (19) were able to
show that [125i]acth(1-24), when incubated with canine left
atrial sections, would bind to sites in cardiac tissue, a finding
which is in agreement with those of the present study using rat
atrial membrane preparations. binding of the acth(1-24) analog
was only observed to any appreciable extent in membrane prepa-

cardiac acth receptors

adrenal tissue have shown that the peptide sequences necessary for
the binding and biological activity of the hormone are localised in
different parts of the molecule. although there is an overlap of
function, the n-terminal sequence appears to be essential for its
biological action while the 11-24 sequence at the c-terminal is
important for binding (13). ways et al. (17) also concluded that
for acth's action on the adrenal gland the structural requirements
for biological activity and for receptor binding are not identical. if
the acth binding sites in cardiac tissue are similar to those in
adrenal tissue, then while the binding of acth to its receptor may
inhibit the neuronal reuptake of the catecholamines (the biological
response), the catecholamines need not affect the binding of
acth to its receptor. in the present study, scatchard analysis of
the binding of the acth(i-24) analog to both adrenal and atrial
membranes gave similar kd values, indicating that indeed the
binding sites in both tissue may be similar.
the dissociation constant obtained for the high-affinity binding
sites of the adrenal membrane preparation is in close agreement
with that obtained by gallo-payet and escher (8) using the same
(125i-tyr23,phe2,nie4]acth(1-24) analog and isolated rat adrenal cells (k d = 1.0 × 10-11 m for fasciculata cells). however,
using a similar acth analog, [ 125i_tyr23 ,phe 2,nle 3]acth(1-38)

and isolated rat adrenal cells, buckely and ramachandran (5)
reported a k d of 1.4 x 10 - 9 m. as suggested by gallo-payet and
escher (8), the marked differences in k d values may be associated
with differences in cell preparation. buckely and ramachandran
(5) assayed their ceils after 18 hr of primary culture at 37°c,
whereas gallo-payet and escher (8) tested freshly harvested cells,
reporting visible decrease in binding capacity after several hours of
primary culture. the membrane preparations used in the present
study were all freshly prepared. the k d values obtained with the
acth analog also are in agreement with values obtained for rat
adrenal cells using normal [t25i]acth(1-39) (10,18).
in summary, using the acth analog [125i-tyr23,
phe2,nlea]acth(1-24), it has been possible to demonstrate the
existence of specific binding sites for acth in atrial membrane
preparations. while the binding of the acth analog was inhibited
by acth(1-24), it was not affected by the catecholamines,
norepinephrine or epinephrine. it is proposed that acth may bind
to sites on the adrenergic nerve endings and not on the cardiac
muscle itself. in so doing, acth would interfere with the
neuronal reuptake of the catecholamines, and thus explain the
acth-induced enhanced myocardial sensitivity to both norepinephrine and epinephrine.
