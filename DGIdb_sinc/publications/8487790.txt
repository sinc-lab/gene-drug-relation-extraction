[interaction of  xxxd3393xxx  and cimetidine in persistent fetal circulation of the newborn infant].  a newborn was treated with  xxxd3393xxx  for persistent pulmonary hypertension. oxygenation improved during continuous infusion of the drug, but gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. therefore, cimetidine was given. after this there was a rapid deterioration with decrease of oxygen saturation and arterial po2 values.  xxxd3393xxx  induces a dilatation of the pulmonary vascular system by stimulating h1 and h2 receptors. blocking of h2 receptors by cimetidine abolishes the effect of  xxxd3393xxx  at least partially. our case shows that the interaction between  xxxd3393xxx  and cimetidine is of clinical significance. the recommendation to use cimetidine as prophylaxis against gastrointestinal side-effects induced by  xxxd3393xxx  can no longer be maintained.
