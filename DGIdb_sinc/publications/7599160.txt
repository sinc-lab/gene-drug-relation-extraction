abstract
the uptake and metabolism
of cobalamin
(cbl) has been studied in l-1210 murine leukemia cells propagating in vitro. extracellular
cbl (protein bound and free) and intracellular cbl (protein bound and free) were determined after culturing l-l 210 cells in the presence
of [ 57co]cyanocobalamin ( xxxd1771xxx ) bound to transcobalamin ii (transcobalamin, tc). the intracellular pool of free [ “co]cbl increased
during the first 24 h of culture and a substantial fraction of this free pool was effluxed from the cell to the medium. upon depletion of
extracellular tc-[ “co] xxxd1771xxx , the intracellular concentration of free cbl decreased as did the efflux of cbl to the medium. internalized
[ “co] xxxd1771xxx  was converted to  xxxd2300xxx 
( xxxd2300xxx ), methylcobalamin
(me-cbl) and s-deoxyadenosylcobalamin.
these cbl
forms were found in both soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble (membrane) fractions. intracellular protein-bound [ “co]cbl fractionated
with  xxxg1479xxx  (ms) and methylmalonyl-coa
mutase (mu) activity. the major form of cbl associated with the two enzymes
was  xxxd2300xxx . cells propagated in medium containing n5-methyltetrahydrofolate
and homocysteine showed a substantial increase in ms
activity which paralleled the increase in the intracellular concentration of me-cbl and the cbl bound to the enzyme.

1. introduction

in humans, cobalamin (cbl) deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, methylmalonic
aciduria and peripheral as
well as central nervous system abnormalities
[1,2]. the
pathological manifestations
of cbl deficiency are due to
the aberrant functioning of two intracellular enzymes that
require two specific forms of cbl as cofactors. the first
enzyme,  xxxg1479xxx  (ms) catalyzes the transfer
of the methyl group of n5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(methylthf) to homocysteine to generate methionine and tetrahydrofolate (thf) and requires methylcobalamin
(me-cbl)
as a cofactor [3,4]. cbl-deficient
cells fail to replicate on
n”-methyl-thf
because of their inability to generate thf
[5]. the latter could be generated from n”-formyl-thf
or
folate through pathways not dependent on cbl but in the
presence of limiting amounts of these compounds, growth
ceases after a few generations due to entrapment of folate

in the form of methyl-thf
[6,7]. the second enzyme,
methylmalonyl-coa
mutase (mu) utilizes 5’-deoxyadenosylcobalamin
(ado-cbl) as the cofactor [8] and catalyses
the isomerization of methylmalonyl-coa
to succinyl-coa.
the methylmalonic
acidemia in cbl deficiency is due to a
block in this pathway [9].
l-1210 cells propagating in culture require a minimum
of 200 molecules of cbl per cell for normal growth and
replication ceases when intracellular
cbl drops to  xxxd1338xxx 
molecules per cell [5]. transport of cbl into l-1210 cells
and other mammalian cells is mediated by transcobalamin
ii (transcobalamin,
tc), a cbl binding protein in plasma
[lo]. the transport process involves binding of tc-cbl to a
cell surface receptor and the subsequent internalization
of
the complex [11,12]. most of the intracellular cbl is bound
to the two cbl dependent enzymes, a cytosolic ms and a
mitochondrial
mu [13]. a specific form of cbl is a
cofactor for each of the above enzymes. however, intracellular events leading to the synthesis and subsequent
disposition of these cbl forms are largely unknown. the
present investigation was undertaken to obtain information
on the synthesis, compartmentalization
and disposition of
cbl compounds in l-1210 mouse leukemia cells propagat-

ing in culture and to provide a model of cbl homeostasis
in a cbl-replete system.

2. materials and methods

2.1. materials
the following were obtained from commercial sources:
rpmi 1640 medium (flow laboratories); human serum
and rpmi 1640 medium deficient in folate and
cyanocobalamin ( xxxd1771xxx ) (irvine scientific); [57co]cncbl, specific activity > 10 kbq//xmol (amersham); dl[14c-methyl]methylmalonyl-coa (p.l. biochemicals); i~l[~4c-methyl]methyltetrahydrofolate, barium salt
(amersham); amberlite xad-2,
1 2 5 - 150 /z
(accurate/serva); ado-cbl, me-cbl, l-homocysteine thiolactone;  xxxd3156xxx ; sephadex g-25 (sigma);
sephacryl s-200 (pharmacia); deae-cellulose de-52
(whatman); sep-pak c18 cartridge (waters) and dowex
 xxxg2361xxx -x8, 200-400 mesh, c1- form (biorad).

2.2. methods
methyl-thf was synthesized by the method of gupta
and huennekens [14]. for the preparation of [svco] xxxd2300xxx ,
a solution of [57co] xxxd1771xxx  was acidified to ph 3.0 with
acetic acid and photolyzed under continuous purging with
argon for 4 h by  xxxd3426xxx -w tungsten lamp at a distance of 10
cm. [svco] xxxd2300xxx  was purified by passage through a
sep-pak cartridge as described under 'quantitation of
cobalamins'. the radioactive purity of the product was
greater than 95%, as judged by thin layer chromatography
(tlc) [15] and by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) [ 16].

growth of l-1 210 cells in the presence of [szco] xxxd1771xxx 
mouse leukemia l-1210 cells normally maintained as a
suspension culture in rpmi-1640 medium containing 5%
fetal calf serum were adapted to grow in 10% human
serum. approx. 10-15 subcultures were required to attain
the original doubling time of about 12 h. flasks (150 cm 2)
containing 50 ml of cbl-deficient rpmi-1640 medium,
penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 /xg/ml)
and 10% human serum saturated with [57co] xxxd1771xxx  were
innoculated with 107 cells and the cultures were incubated
at 37°c in 5% co2-95% air. cell numbers were determined using a coulter counter and cell viability was
determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. the cbl binding
capacity of each lot of human serum was determined by
the method of gottlieb et al. [17].

'medium' fraction was retained for analysis (see below).
the pellet (cell fraction) was washed twice in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs), suspended in 50 ml of 0.015 m
sodium phosphate, ph 7.0, containing 2 mm glutathione
and disrupted for 60 s using a branson sonifier fitted with
a microprobe. the sonicate was centrifuged (105000 × g,
1 h, 4° c) to obtain the 'insoluble membrane fraction' and
the 'soluble cytoplasmic fraction'. the soluble fraction
was further fractionated into free cbl and protein-bound
cbl by chromatography on a 1.5 × 25 cm column of
deae-cellulose that had been equilibrated in 0.02 m
sodium phosphate, ph 7.0, containing 2 mm glutathione.
the column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer
and then eluted with a linear gradient formed by mixing
300 ml of buffer and 300 ml of 0.5 m  xxxg2020xxx  in the buffer at
a flow rate of 60 m l / h and 3 ml fractions were collected.

separation of free and protein-bound cobalamin compounds in the medium fraction
a 10 ml aliquot of the medium fraction was chromatographed at 4° c on a 2.5 × 90 cm column of sephacryl
s-200 that had been equilibrated in 0.05 m potassium
phosphate, ph 7.0, containing 0.5 m naci. elution was
carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 120 m l / h
and 3 ml fractions were collected.

quantitation of" cobalamins
aliquots of cells, medium or various subfractions
(membrane-bound, soluble protein-bound, intracellular free
pool) were mixed with five volumes of ethanol and heated
for 20 min at 70°c and centrifuged (1500 × g, 10 rain,
25 ° c). the supernatant was evaporated to dryness using a
buchi rotary evaporator and the residue was dissolved in 2
ml of water. the solution was desalted by passage through
a sep-pak cartridge that had been conditioned by washing
with 3 ml of acetonitrile followed by 12 ml of water. the
cartridge was washed with 10 ml of water and then eluted
with 6 ml of 50% acetonitrile. the eluate was evaporated
to dryness, dissolved in 30 /zl of water and analyzed for
cbl compounds by two-dimensional tlc and bioautography [15] and by hplc [16]. the recovery of radiolabeled
cbl in the ethanol extract was 91 _+ 3% and the overall
recovery of cbl after the desalting procedure was > 85%.
this yield is considerably higher than the ~ 50% recovery
of cbl from solid tissues and serum and is similar to the
extractability of cbl from mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes
and other suspension cultures. all of the above steps were
carried out under dim red light in order to prevent photolysis of the cbl coenzymes. radioactivity was determined in
a beckman gamma spectrometer.

2.3. enzyme assays
fractionation procedure
at various time intervals, the contents of one flask (or,
in some instances, the pooled contents of 20 to 30 flasks)
were centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 rain, 4° c). the supernatant

 xxxg1485xxx 
the following was adapted from the procedures of
mazumder et al. [18] and kolhouse et al. [19]. the reaction

e. v. quadros, d. w. jacobsen/biochimica et biophysica acta 1244 (1995) 395-403

mixture (in a capped tube) contained 0.15 p.mol of
[14c]methylmalonyl-coa (50000 dpm), 1 /zmol of glutathione, 20 /zmol of  xxxg2020xxx , 20 /zmol of potassium phosphate, ph 7.4 and the sample (200 /xl) in a total volume of
400 /zl. after incubation at 30°c for 10 min in the dark,
the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 /zl of 2
m perchloric acid. the tube was heated at 100°c for 3
rain, cooled to 4°c and centrifuged (1500 × g, 15 min,
4° c). the supernatant (250 /zl) was treated with 50 /zl of
2 m perchloric acid and 500 p.! of 4% potassium permanganate and heated at 100 ° c for 5 min. after centrifugation
(1500 x g, 15 min, 4° c), the supernatant (400 p.1) and 200
/~1  xxxd3029xxx  were combined in a glass counting vial
and heated at 90°c for 60 min. after cooling, 0.5 ml of
water and 10 ml of scintillation cocktail were added and
the sample was analyzed for radioactivity using a beckman ls counter. this assay measured only the holo form
of the enzyme. to measure the sum of the holo and apo
forms, the sample was incubated with 7.4 nmol of ado-cbl
for 10 rain in the dark prior to the enzyme assay.

the tube containing the assay mixture was evacuated,
filled with argon and incubated at 37 ° c for 1 h in the dark.
the reaction was stopped by transferring the tubes to an
ice bath and the mixture was applied to a 0.5 x 3 cm
column of agi x8, c1- form, in a pasteur pipet. the
washed column was eluted with 2 ml of water and the
product [~4c-methyl]methionine formed was collected in a
glass counting vial; after the addition of 15 ml of scintillation fluid, the radioactivity was determined as described
above.

3. results

3.1. labeling of intracellular and extracellular cobalamins
l-1210 cells were propagated in a medium that contained 10% human serum saturated with [syco] xxxd1771xxx .
cells were harvested at 5, 24, 48 and 72 h and partitioning
of labeled cbl between the cells and the medium was
determined. the values reported for the cbl in the medium,
cells and the various subfractions of cells represent the
distribution of tc-bound [57co]cbl added to the culture.
these values do not include the small contribution of
endogenous unlabeled cbl in the cells used as the inoculum and the holo-tc in human serum. data from a representative experiment are shown in fig. 1. the culture
medium initially contained a total of 3.7 pmol of bound
labeled cbl, of which 2.7 pmol were associated with tc
and 1.0 pmol with other cbl binders in human serum.
disappearance of tc-bound [svco] xxxd1771xxx  from the

 xxxg1479xxx 
the following procedure was adapted from the method
of taylor and weissbach [20]. the reaction mixture contained 125 nmol of ns-[ 14c]methyltetrahydrofolate (60 000
dpm), 750 nmol of homocysteine, 50 nmol of  xxxd3156xxx , 10 /xmol of dithiothreitol, 12.5 /xmol of
potassium phosphate, ph 7.2 and the sample (300 /zl) in a
total volume of 500/zl. this assay measures the holo-form
of the enzyme; 24 nmol of me-cbl were included in the
reaction to measure the sum of the holo and apo forms.

experimental conditions as in fig. l except that the extracellular free
subfraction was analyzed for individual cbl forms, as described in
section 2. + a t time '0' all of the [57co] xxxd1771xxx  in the medium was
protein-bound and no free [57co]cbl was detected at 1 / 2 h.

medium was linear with time and essentially complete by
48 h (fig. 1). in contrast, [57co]cbl bound to other serum
proteins was unchanged over the entire 72 h period (data
not shown). the loss of tc-bound cbl from the medium
could be fully accounted for by labeled cbl retained
intracellularly plus free cbl returned to the medium.
time-dependent changes in the concentration of intracellular [57co]cbl, expressed as molecules/cell, are shown
in fig. 1 inset. the maximum concentration (3200
molecules/cell) was achieved at 24 h but this value declined to a stable level of about 1000 molecules/cell as
the stationary phase of growth was reached. the size of the
free cbl pool in the culture medium increased and its
composition changed markedly over the 72-h period (table 1).  xxxd1771xxx , initially the major form, was replaced
progressively by  xxxd2300xxx  and ado-cbl and at the conclusion of the experiment the latter two forms accounted for
84% of the total cbl. the presence of ado-cbl in the
medium suggests that the extracellular free cbl must have
originated from  xxxd1771xxx  that had been processed inside the

cells. a comparison of the relative proportions of the cbl
forms in the intracellular free pool with the free cbl in the
culture medium revealed that at 24 and 48 h, the ratios of
the coenzyme forms (me-cbl + ado-cbl) to the noncoenzyme forms ( xxxd1771xxx  +  xxxd2300xxx ) were similar (data
from tables 1 and 2). this provides additional evidence
that the free cbl in the medium originated from the
intracellular free pool.

3.2. compartmentalization of intracellular labeled cobalamins
cells grown in the presence of [57co] xxxd1771xxx  were
disrupted by sonication and the lysate was separated by
centrifugation into the intracellular insoluble and soluble
tractions. the latter was further separated into free cbl and
protein-bound subfractions by chromatography on deaecellulose. table 2 summarizes the concentration of
[57c0]cbl and the concentration of individual cbl forms in
each of these fractions as a function of time. [ 5 7 c o ] c b l
taken up by the cells during the first 24 h was distributed
almost equally among the three compartments. at 72 h,
however, most of the label had shifted into the insoluble
fraction and the protein-bound subfraction of the soluble
fraction. the insoluble fraction, which includes plasma
membranes and mitochondrial membranes, may contain
tc-cbl bound to the membrane receptor and cbl bound to
mu still associated with the mitochondrial membranes.
this assumption is supported by the high initial level of
 xxxd1771xxx  and the nearly constant amount of ado-cbl in this
subfraction. the protein-bound subfraction of the soluble
fraction was a mixture of mu, cytoplasmic ms and nondegraded internalized tc. the latter protein was detected
up to 48 h but by 72 h it had disappeared and all of the
labeled cbl was associated with the two enzymes. the

experimental conditions as in fig. 1 except that cells were lysed and the mixture was separated into the indicated fractions. the latter were analyzed for
radioactivity and for individual cbl forms. the protein-bound fraction was the pooled contents of tubes 100-150 alter chromatography of the soluble
fraction on deae-cellulose (see section 2 and fig. 2).

major form of the cytoplasmic protein-bound cbl was
 xxxd2300xxx  (77% of the total) and smaller amounts of ado-cbl
(12%),  xxxd1771xxx  (7%) and me-cbl (4%) were also present.

surement of enzymes was resolved on a separate deaecellulose column and a slight difference in the sodium
chloride gradient may have contributed to a shift in the
elution profiles and hence, the enzyme peaks cannot be
directly correlated with the elution profile of the
[svco]cbl-labeled protein peaks. as shown in fig 2b, the
holo-mu appeared in two peaks of approximately equal
activity which were centered at fractions 120 (same as
fraction 112 in fig. 2a) and 140 (same as fraction 130 in
fig. 2a). the first peak contained most of the apo-mu as
shown by the increase in enzyme activity when ado-cbl
was included in the assay. in contrast, relatively little
apo-mu was found in the second peak. holo-ms activity
was contained in a single peak and was centered at fraction
138 (same as fraction 130 in fig. 2a). the apo-ms

profile (data not shown) followed by a small amount of tc
(fraction 57) and an unidentified component (fraction 73).
most of the radioactivity was contained in a broad peak

b cells were grown under standard conditions (see section 2), except that the rpmi 1640 was supplemented with 20 tim folate. cells were harvested at 48

fraction were analyzed for ms activity.
c cells were made folate deficient by culturing in folate and cbt-deficient rpmi 1640 medium fbr 48 h and then propagated in medium supplemented with
20 /zm 5-methyl-thf, 150 /zm homocysteine and 10% human serum saturated with [svco] xxxd2300xxx ; concentration of the latter was 74 pm.

the radiolabeled peak (shown in fig. 2a) and was centered
at fraction 156 (fig. 2c).

was centered at tube 130 (same as tube 138 in fig. 2c)
which was followed in this instance by an even larger peak
at tube 158 (same as tube 156 in fig. 2c). measurement of
ms in a separate sample subjected to similar analysis
showed that regions of both radioactive peaks contained
considerable amounts of apo-ms activity and the ratio of
apo-ms activity in the two peaks was similar to that
observed in cells grown in normal rpmi-1640 medium. in
contrast, the distribution of holo-ms was reversed in that
the region of the second peak contained higher holo-ms
activity (fig. 3).

3.4. enhancement of the levels of me-cbl and methionine
synthase
the intracellular folate pool was lowered by growing
cells in folate-free medium for 48 h. these cells were then
supplied with 5-methyl-thf, homocysteine and [ 5 7 c o ] o h cbl for analyzing the enzyme-bound [57co] xxxd2300xxx  and
with nonradioactive  xxxd2300xxx  for measuring the ms activity. culturing cells under these conditions, resulted in a
nine-fold increase in the level of me-cbl and a three-fold
increase in the holo form of ms (table 3). additional
information was obtained by subjecting the intracellular
soluble fraction to chromatography on deae-cellulose
which showed two major [svco]cbl-labeled peaks in the
region of ms activity (fig. 3). the first radiolabeled peak

4. discussion

the relatively small amount of cbl distributed among
various cellular compartments is difficult to estimate using

sufficiently labeled to allow their quantitation. in the present investigation, an expanding population of l-1210 cells
was provided with [svco] xxxd1771xxx  bound to cbl binders in
human serum. the concentration of tc-cbl in the medium
was similar to that in human plasma. only tc-bound-cbl
was taken up by the cells. although the tc in the medium
had dropped to zero at the end of the experiment, the data
indicated that a large intracellular pool of cbl was generated and converted to the coenzyme forms. indeed, the
release of free cbl back into the medium demonstrated that
an excess was present intracellularly. even though most of
the tc from the medium was taken up by cells within 48
h, at no time was there a build-up of intracellular tc. in
fact, at 24 h when more than 50% was taken up, the level
of tc [57cn]cbl in the soluble fraction was less than 4%
of the total cytosolic radioactivity. previous reports [21,22]
have indicated that after incubating l-1210 cells in serum,
approx. 50% of the cytosolic radioactivity was associated
with tc. more recently, using 125i-labeled tc and human
fibroblasts in culture, it was shown that after an initial lag
period of about 2 h, the protein is rapidly broken down
[23]. our results indicate progressive uptake of tc-cbl and
rapid release of free cbl into the cytosol. since only a
small fraction of the internalized cbl is transferred to
cbl-dependent enzymes, the uptake of tc-cbl appears to
be a function of extracellular tc-cbl concentration and is
not influenced by intraceilular cbl concentration.
the continuous efflux of free cbl was originally thought
to occur via diffusion since during the early stages of
culture, a high concentration of free intracellular cbl is

401

generated. based on an average diameter of l0 /~m, the
l-1210 cell has a volume of 5.2. 10 -~3 ml and the
cytoplasmic space would account for ~ 20% of this volume. using these parameters, at 24 h the intracellular pool
of free cbl is estimated to be 2.5- 10 -8 m while the
extracellular concentration is 10. 10 -12 m. this would
favor the effiux of free cbl by diffusion. further analysis
of this process however, indicated that the cbl efflux is
fairly rapid, taking less than 2 h to complete, approximately equal to the free cbl in the cell and virtually nil at
4° c. extracellular cbl concentration (370 pm tc-bound
cbl or 35 /zm free cbl) did not affect the effiux of
intracellular cbl (data not shown). cell viability was >
95% throughout the culture and for effiux studies, hence
the effiux observed could not be due to leakage of cbl
from nonviable cells.
these observations suggest that a transport system exists for effiux of free cbl out of cells. the large pool of
free cbl generated within the cell during tc-cbl uptake
may represent surplus cbl that is not needed in the cell. a
system for removing this surplus may be present in most
cells since the effluxed cbl would then be available to the
extracellular binders for mobilizing to other cells or organs. when very little tc-cbl is available such as in cbl
deficiency, the intracellular free pool should be virtually
nil. whether the efflux phenomenon is a peculiarity of
l-1210 cells in culture or a normal function of cells both
in vivo and in vitro needs to be determined.
the major form of cbl in human plasma is me-cbl and
this form is disproportionately reduced in cbl deficiency

fig. 4. schematic representation of cbl metabolism in l1210 cells. the figure shows the internalization of tcii- xxxd1771xxx  via the membrane receptor and
the intracellular pool of cbl cofactors. me-cbl is the cofactor for the cytosolic enzyme ms and ado cb! is the cofactor for the mitochondrial enzyme mu.
 xxxd2300xxx  and gs-cbl are thought to be intermediary forms in the synthesis of cbl coenzymes. the interaction of cbl with intracellular glutathione (gsh)
generates gs-cbl. this cbl form was not analyzed in the present study but is shown in the figure for completeness.

[24]. ado-cbl and  xxxd2300xxx  account for more than 80% of
the tissue cbl [25]. a number of other cbl forms have
been identified in animal tissues [26] and recent reports
have suggested that glutathionyl cbl (gs-cbl) may be an
intermediate in the synthesis of cbl coenzymes [27,28].
the  xxxd2300xxx  levels reported in the present study may
include intracellular gs-cbl. however, the hplc and the
2-dimensional tlc methods used in this study do not
resolve gs-cbl from  xxxd2300xxx ; hence, we could not identify
any gs-cbl. even though gs-cbl has been shown in an
enzymatic system, the distribution of this cbl form in cells
and tissues is yet to be established. a hypothetical scheme
for the flow of cbl into and out of l-1210 cells and the
intracellular interconversion of these forms is outlined in
fig. 4. the rapid appearance of free  xxxd1771xxx  inside the cell
and simultaneous increase in  xxxd2300xxx  suggests that some
 xxxd1771xxx  is converted to  xxxd2300xxx  while the vitamin is being
dissociated from tc in the lysosome or soon thereafter.
lysosomal ph a n d / o r specific enzymes may play a role in
cleaving the co-c bond. even the coenzyme forms of cbl
are subjected to co-c cleavage when transported into cells
[29]. the cbl reductases or enzymes involved in the
synthesis of cbl coenzymes may mediate the removal of
the upper axial ligand [27,28].
 xxxd2300xxx  is presumed to be the substrate for the enzymatic formation of ado-cbl and me-cbl. in bacterial
systems, the transformation to ado-cbl is believed to
involve a reducing system followed by adenosylation
[30,31]. the preponderance of ado-cbl in the soluble
fraction suggests the existence of a similar system in
l-1210 cells but the origin of ado-cbl, be it mitochondrial
or cytoplasmic, has not been determined. whether a similar system exists for the synthesis of me-cbl is not known.
since the cbl bound to proteins co-eluting with mu and
ms activity from the deae column contains ~ 80% of
the cbl in the hydroxo form, it would seem that both of
these enzymes bind  xxxd2300xxx  avidly. fenton and rosenberg
[32] have shown that ado-cbl is synthesized in mitochondria when isolated mitochondria are incubated with
[svco] xxxd2300xxx . even though a separate cytoplasmic synthesis of ado-cbl has not been demonstrated, the existence
of such a system cannot be ruled out. however, it does
appear to be synthesized at a rate higher than the needs of
the mutase as shown by the fact that a considerable
amount of ado-cbl is found in the free state in the cell and
in the culture medium.
the specific activity of mu in l-1210 cells in culture
for 48 h is 11.6 n m o l / h per mg protein. using a turnover
number of 14000 min i reported for the sheep liver
enzyme [33], this would correspond to ~ 400 copies of the
enzyme/cell. since mu consists of two identical subunits,
each capable of binding ado-cbl, the molecules of ado-cbl
on the enzyme should be ~ 800 which is not in agreement
with ~ 300 molecules of ado-cbl present in the cell.
however, there is some uncertainty about the level of the
mutase and its correlation to the level of ado-cbl in the

cell since ado-cbl is equally distributed among the soluble
protein, the insoluble membrane fraction and as free cbl in
the soluble fraction.
the small amount of me-cbl synthesized under the
present experimental conditions is consistent with the fact
that cells grown on  xxxd2146xxx  do not place much demand
on ms. assuming that the turnover number for the l-1210
enzyme is similar to the value (780 min -1) reported for
the bacterial and mammalian enzymes [34], one should
find ~ 2200 molecules of ms holoenzyme per cell. since
the level of me-cbl in the cell was 32 molecules, it is
possible that the level of me-cbl on the enzyme may not
reflect the true activity of the enzyme and that it could be
synthesized directly on the enzyme during the catalytic
cycle. in order to test this hypothesis, the soluble fraction
from l-1210 cells grown on methyl-thf, homocysteine
and [57co] xxxd2300xxx  was fractionated on a deae column
and [57co]cbl-labeled ms was obtained (peak centered at
fraction 158, fig. 3). aliquots of the pooled ms were
incubated at 37 ° c in the presence of substrates and cofactots; the enzyme was separated from the reaction mixture
by passing through a sephadex g-25 column and analyzed
for cbl forms. the proportion of me-cbl on the enzyme
from an initial level of 4% had increased to 35% at l0 min
to 45% at 1 h and 64% at 2 h. this increase was observed
even in the presence of a large surplus of homocysteine in
the reaction mixture. cbl bound to the enzyme did not
dissociate or exchange with exogenously added me-cbl
during the assay (results not shown). these and previous
observations that the cbl on the purified enzyme from e.
coli k i2 can be directly methylated [35,36] and that the
intracellular synthesis of me-cbl is affected by folate
analogues [37] suggests that ms is the most likely site of
me-cbl synthesis.
the present results focus attention on some intriguing
characteristics of mu and ms in l-1210 cells. it is not
clear, for example, why the two cbl-dependent enzymes
exist in the apo form when there is surplus free cbl in the
cell (table 2). another puzzling aspect of this study is the
observation that the enzymes exist in multiple forms that
can be separated chromatographically (figs. 3 and 4). it is
understandable that the apo and holo forms may elute
differently because of the difference in cofactors associated with the two forms but the distribution of protein
bound [57co]cbl as well as the enzyme activity in the
elution profile indicates that each enzyme may also exist in
two holo forms. two peaks of holo activity for each of the
enzymes in the region of the protein-bound cbl peak were
also observed in rat-liver extracts [38]. factors other than
the bound cbl may contribute to the heterogeneity of these
enzymes. based on the ratio of holo-enzyme to the apo-enzyme, it appears that the two enzymes are less than 30%
saturated with cbl. since the cbl was not limiting, factors
other than the availability of cbl must dictate the binding
and stimulation of enzyme activity by cbl cofactors, among
them, the affinity ( k a) of the enzyme for the cbl cofactor.
