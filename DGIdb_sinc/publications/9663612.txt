 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptor stimulation enhances experimental gastric carcinogenesis induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine in wistar rats.  the effect of prolonged administration of the norepinephrine-mimicking agent  xxxd2584xxx , the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and the  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic agonist clonidine on the incidence of gastric cancers induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng), the  xxxg1626xxx  activity of the gastric cancer and the labeling index of the gastric mucosa were investigated in wistar rats. rats received s.c. injections of  xxxd2584xxx , phenylephrine or clonidine every other day after 20 weeks of oral treatment with mnng. at week 52, administration of  xxxd2584xxx  and phenylephrine at the higher dose significantly increased the incidence of gastric cancers, the  xxxg1626xxx  activity of the gastric cancers and the labeling index of the antral epithelial cells. administration of phenylephrine at the lower dose and clonidine at both doses had no significant effect on the incidence of gastric cancers, the  xxxg1626xxx  activity of the gastric cancers or the labeling index of the gastric mucosa. our results suggest that adrenoreceptor stimulation enhances gastric carcinogenesis and that such enhancement is mediated through  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptors without  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor involvement.
