introduction
sleep is a physiological state that has been shown to be
necessary to maintain homeostasis, proper body functioning and mental health in humans. the control of
sleep and wakefulness is a complex process involving
the coordinated activity of numerous neuronal circuits.
it is thought that a fundamental role in this phenomenon is played by a relatively small group of hypothalamic neurons that synthesize and release orexins
(also known as hypocretins).

in humans, the orexinergic cell population is formed
by ∼80 000 neurons that are exclusively localized in the
perifornical nucleus and the lateral and posterior hypothalamic area (peyron et al., 1998). they are therefore
in an ideal position to inﬂuence both sleep and wakefulness. similar to other neuropeptides, orexins have
a broad spectrum of regulatory effects in the central
nervous system. they inﬂuence the physiology of
virtually all brain functions, from sleep and homeostasis to memory, emotions and reward (sakurai and
mieda, 2011).
many reviews have been written in the last 10 yr on
orexin neurons and their role in the regulation of sleep
and wakefulness (e.g. sakurai, 2007; bonnavion and de
lecea, 2010; nishino 2011). animal models have been
of great use to explore the mechanisms involved.
therefore, we will only brieﬂy report the general
knowledge on this issue to aid understanding of our

insomnia is a serious medical and social problem, its prevalence in the general population ranges from 9 to
35% depending on the country and assessment method. often, patients are subject to inappropriate and
therefore dangerous pharmacotherapies that include prolonged administration of hypnotic drugs, benzodiazepines and other gabaa receptor modulators. this usually does not lead to a satisfactory improvement in patients’ clinical states and may cause lifelong drug dependence. brain state transitions require
the coordinated activity of numerous neuronal pathways and brain structures. it is thought that orexinexpressing neurons play a crucial role in this process. due to their interaction with the sleep–wakeregulating neuronal population, they can activate vigilance-promoting regions and prevent unwanted
sleep intrusions. understanding the multiple orexin modulatory effects is crucial in the context of pathogenesis of insomnia and should lead to the development of novel treatments. an important step in this
process was the synthesis of dual antagonists of orexin receptors. crucially, these drugs, as opposed to
benzodiazepines, do not change the sleep architecture and have limited side-effects. this new pharmacological approach might be the most appropriate to treat insomnia.

fig. 1. an outline model of interaction of orexins and selected dual orexin receptor antagonists (doras) with the orexin
receptor 1 ( xxxg1031xxx ) and  xxxg1032xxx  ( xxxg1032xxx ) molecules.  xxxg1031xxx  is a gq-coupled receptor, its excitation causes phospholipase
cbeta (plcbeta) pathway activation, which leads to calcium ions release from endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent neuron
depolarization. extracellular ca2+ can also ﬂow through an alternative way via non-selective cationic channels (nscc) in the
cell membrane opened with the help of gq.  xxxg1031xxx  may also activate  xxxg1759xxx  leading to the production of
lysophosphatydylcholine (lpc) and polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas), mainly  xxxd208xxx . these substances promote
the opening of nscc and activate ca2+ inﬂux. diacylglycerol lipase (dagl) converts diacylglycerol to endocannabinoid –
2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-ag), which stimulate the cannabinoid 1 (cb1) receptors. as opposed to  xxxg1031xxx ,  xxxg1032xxx  is conjugated
with gq as well as gi/o protein. in the case of gi/o protein activation, the closing of g-protein gated inwardly rectifying
potassium (girk) channels occurs, followed by an inhibition of k+ outﬂow leading to an increase of neuronal excitability.

main focus. this review aims at reporting and discussing recent evidence highlighting a key role of orexinergic neurons in the context of pathogenesis of
insomnia and the development of new treatments
targeting this system.
orexinergic innervation: the source of
sleep–wake cycle modulation
orexins were independently isolated in 1998 by two
groups searching either for neuropeptides speciﬁcally
expressed in the hypothalamus (de lecea et al., 1998)
or for endogenous ligands of orphan receptor
hfgan72, deﬁned today as  xxxg1031xxx  ( xxxg1031xxx ;
sakurai et al., 1998). they belong to and possess a structural homology to other known neuropeptides of the
incretin family. the group is composed of two peptides:
orexin a and b. they are derivatives of one polypeptide
precursor called  xxxg1030xxx  and are generated
following post-translational activity of convertases.

orexin a and b are peptides with fundamentally different characteristics, well preserved among vertebrates.
orexin a is composed of 33 amino acids with two
disulphide bridges (cys6–cys12 and cys7–cys17) in
its molecule. it is characterized by a higher stability
in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and in blood than orexin
b. on the other hand, orexin b is a linear molecule
composed of 28 amino acids and its concentration in
the brain is 2–5 times higher in comparison to orexin
a (sakurai et al., 1998).
orexins act via two receptors, known as  xxxg1031xxx  and
 xxxg1032xxx , belonging to the g-protein-coupled receptor
family. they are composed of seven transmembrane
domains encoded by separate exons and show signiﬁcant homology among mammals. they show diverse
afﬁnity to orexins:  xxxg1031xxx  has higher afﬁnity to orexin
a, whereas  xxxg1032xxx  is equally sensitive for both peptides.
their activation always induces excitation of target
neurons through cascades of secondary transmitters
(kukkonen, 2013; fig. 1).

orexinergic cells, which co-express glutamate and
dynorphin, are projection neurons that target multiple
brain regions involved in the execution of sleep/wake
cycles (peyron et al., 1998). many of these targets
are reciprocally connected to orexinergic cells providing feedback and feed-forward information (sakurai
et al., 2010; fig. 2). the main orexinergic projections
target wakefulness-promoting regions such as the
histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus in the posterior hypothalamus, the cholinergic neurons of the
basal forebrain and the brainstem, the monoaminergic
neurons in the brainstem such as the locus coeruleus
(lc) and the raphe nuclei. moreover, they are innervated by neurons originating from serotoninergic
raphe nuclei and noradrenergic lc cells. both monoamines have inhibitory effects on orexinergic neurons.
an additional source of inhibition is indirectly
mediated by dopamine from the ventral tegmental
area via  xxxg831xxx -adrenoreceptors and glycinergic inhibitory
ﬁbres (yamanaka et al., 2003; hondo et al., 2012).
importantly, orexinergic cells receive excitatory cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain (sakurai, 2007).
in agreement with the observed widespread orexin
action in the central nervous system, their receptors
have been identiﬁed in various brain regions (trivedi
et al., 1998; marcus et al., 2001).

involvement of orexinergic signalling in
sleep–wake cycle regulation
accumulating data highlight the role of orexins in the
transition from sleep to wakefulness (de lecea et al.,
2012). intracerebroventricular infusion or local microinjections of orexins into the lc result in a large
increase in waking time and a decrease in paradoxical
sleep (ps) periods (hagan et al., 1999; bourgin et al.,
2000). activation of orexin neurons using optogenetic
tools drastically increases the transition from sleep to
wakefulness (adamantidis et al., 2007). recent studies
have also shown that optically inhibiting lc neurons
during orexinergic stimulation block orexin-dependent
sleep to wake transitions. conversely, when the same
lc perikarya were photo stimulated, concomitant activation of orexinergic neurons increased the probability
of the aforementioned switches compared with orexin
stimulation alone. these ﬁndings have emphasized
the crucial role of orexin-lc neuronal interplay in the
regulation of non-rapid eye movement sleep/wake
cycles (carter et al., 2012).
in addition, a defect in the orexinergic system
( xxxg1030xxx  knockout mice (chemelli et al., 1999)
leads to a narcolepsy phenotype as translated by
sleep fragmentation, a shortened ps latency and direct

associated with an increase of sws and ps without any
alterations in their ratio. importantly, no cataplexy
with ps intrusions was recorded and animals returned
to normal sleep–wake cycles after cessation of treatment. no traditional long-term, non-desirable outcomes of the pharmacotherapy such as the rebound
effect and tolerance were reported (brisbare-roch
et al., 2010).
in healthy subjects, the drug caused both objective
(electrophysiological measurements) and subjective
sleep symptoms (brisbare-roch et al., 2007; hoever
et al., 2010). almorexant was administered orally to
participants in the morning hours in doses between
1 and 1000 mg and quantitative electroencephalogram
(eeg) signals were recorded for 25 min starting 90 min
post-administration (brisbare-roch et al., 2007). the
authors reported a dose-dependent reduction of
latency to sws stage 2, total sleep time (tst) and
amount of time in stage 2. these effects lasted >6 h
for the higher dose (1000 mg) associated with an
increase in eeg delta and theta band frequency power (the
extent of this increase being unknown). almorexant
was well tolerated with no episodes of cataplexy but
some adverse effects have been reported. almorexant
has also been tested on sleep variables in patients
suffering from primary insomnia (at doses 50, 100,
200 and 400 mg) and was shown to improve sleep
efﬁciency (tst divided by time in bed), decreased
sleep initiation and the time spent in sws stage 1
(hoever et al., 2012b).the drug also had an effect on
sleep architecture with a normalization of sws distribution over the course of the night and an increase in

the ps duration to normal values. the safety proﬁle
was favourable for the lower doses, some adverse
events were evident only for the 400 mg dose; however, no symptoms of narcolepsy or cataplexy were
observed (hoever et al., 2012b). some concerns have
been raised that almorexant might improve insomnia
by inducing narcoleptic-like symptoms, such as direct
transition from wakefulness to rapid eye movement
sleep rather than promoting physiological sleep. it
has also been suggested that almorexant may cause a
reduction in muscle tone (tafti, 2007). this controversy
indicates that further studies are needed to ﬁnd out
whether almorexant is a safer hypnotic agent than
traditional drugs. in 2008, clinical trials of almorexant
(restore physiological sleep with the orexin receptor
antagonist almorexant) started with a study involving
709 patients with chronic primary insomnia. this polysomnographic evaluation was focused on the efﬁcacy
and safety of 16-d oral administration of almorexant
(200 and 100 mg) in adults. according to the results
reported by actelion (www.actelion.com, www.
sleepreviewmag.com/sleep_report/2010-01-13_03.asp),
the study has shown a superiority of almorexant compared to placebo on objective and subjective wakefulness after sleep onset (waso). a recent ﬁnding in
healthy subjects has shown that lower doses (100 and
200 mg) of almorexant were well tolerated. from
5200 mg, some adverse effects, e.g. headache, fatigue,
blurred vision, were reported more frequently for the
almorexant than placebo. one case of sleep paralysis
was described at the highest (1000 mg) dose only
(hoever et al., 2012a).

sb-649868
sb-649868 is a dora with similar afﬁnity to  xxxg1031xxx  and
 xxxg1032xxx  with a 3–6 h half-life (di fabio et al., 2011; bettica
et al., 2012c; table 2).
when administrated to rats, sb-649868 was able to
reduce sleep latency and wakefulness with a concomitant increase of tst and ps time without any motor
coordination impairment (di fabio et al., 2011; piccoli
et al., 2012). these results were conﬁrmed by studies
in healthy humans or patients suffering from insomnia
(bettica et al., 2012a, b, c). in most cases, these effects
were dose-dependent, especially for tst. when compared with zolpidem, sb-649868 has a greater ability
to decrease tst and waso (bettica et al., 2012b).
objective hypnotic activities of sb-649868 were in
accordance with subjective sleep quality improvements
assessed by questionnaires and by pharmaco-eeg
showing an increase of theta and decrease of alpha and beta
waves 1 and 2 h after drug dosing (bettica et al.,
2012a, b).
analysis of sleep phases revealed that the duration
of ps was augmented after the sb-649868 administration while an opposite effect of zolpidem was

insomnia is often associated with neuropsychiatric
disorders such as depression resulting in putative
dangerous drug interactions. despite the inhibitory
effect of almorexant on cyp2d6, an isoform of cytochrome p450 engaged in metabolism of many psychiatric drugs, it has been shown that the concomitant
action of almorexant and desipramine (an antidepressant) did not modify the expected effects of almorexant
alone (cruz et al., 2010). interestingly, a recent study
on mice suggested that almorexant might even present
antidepressive properties (nollet et al., 2011) and could
indicate an involvement of the orexinergic system in
the pathophysiology of major depression. supporting
this assumption almorexant has been shown to induce
a robust antidepressant-like effect and the restoration
of stress-related dysregulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis independently of a neurogenic action (nollet et al., 2012). however, it is worth
noting that narcoleptic patients also present depressive
symptoms (peyron et al., 2000; jara et al., 2011).
since 2008, actelion and glaxo smith kline have
conducted phase ii studies on almorexant. however,
at the beginning of 2011, they unexpectedly discontinued these studies due to unfavourable safety
and tolerance proﬁles of the drug (actelion.com).
both companies do not reveal the detailed causes
and therefore no information is available for potential
continuation of these studies in the future.

cyp3a4 is known to metabolize sb-649868 (renzulli
et al., 2011), so an inhibition of self-metabolism may
occur.
sb-649868 seemed to be quite well tolerated with
side-effects mostly related to the sleep-promoting
mechanism of action (bettica et al., 2012a, b, c).
however, a dose-related cognitive impairment was
observed 2 h after drug administration with no
residual effects in the morning several hours later
(bettica et al., 2012c).

human model of noise-induced insomnia (bettica
et al., 2012b) or even decreased in patients and healthy
subjects (bettica et al., 2012a, c).
interestingly, sb-649868 was also shown to dosedependently inhibit cyp3a4 using simvastatin as a
known drug metabolized by this enzyme. after
administration of sb-649868, exposure to simvastatin
was increased, suggesting cyp3a4 attenuation
(bettica et al., 2012c). it is worth mentioning that

 xxxd3267xxx , like almorexant, is a dual antagonist of
orexin receptors and is currently in phase 3 clinical
trials (table 3). changes in sleep behaviour after
30 mg/kg treatment were observed in rats (cox et al.,
2010). it has also been shown to induce a transient
decrease in locomotor activity, dose-dependently promote sleep and to positively modify sleep architecture
in rats, dogs and rhesus monkeys (cox et al., 2010;
winrow et al., 2011).
randomized, double-blind clinical trials focused on
the efﬁcacy and tolerance of  xxxd3267xxx  in patients
suffering from primary insomnia. polysomnographic
studies involved two 4-wk sessions of oral administration of  xxxd3267xxx  at doses of 10, 20, 40 and
80 mg. the treatment was shown to have signiﬁcant
dose-related effects for sleep induction and maintenance parameters. in general, the drug was well tolerated with only one patient suffering from side-effects
in the form of hypnagogic hallucinations and daytime
sleepiness (herring et al., 2012).
mk-6096
mk-6096 is a highly potent and selective antagonist of
both orexin receptors in humans and rats, with equivalent potency for  xxxg1031xxx  and  xxxg1032xxx  (winrow et al.,
2012). it represents a new series of doras, a
2,5-disubstituted piperidine with a molecular structure
slightly different to that of almorexant and  xxxd3267xxx .
mk-6096 has been shown to dose-dependently promote sleep in rats and dogs (coleman et al., 2012;
table 3). in rats, a reduction in active wakefulness
has been observed associated with an increase in
sws and ps and a decrease in latency for both states.
this sleep-promoting effect was less evident after
almorexant administration and, in this case, no
changes in sws and ps latencies were observed
(winrow et al., 2012). moreover, in contrast to almorexant (revealing lower efﬁcacy in somnolescence
induction), mk-6096 treatment in dogs led to a signiﬁcant dose-dependent decrease in active wakefulness

conclusions
the present century has witnessed an increase of
sleep-related disorders accompanied by efforts to
produce more effective treatments than the traditional
benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines (z-drugs),
antagonists of h1-histamine receptors and agonists of
melatonin receptors. the ideal candidate would only
promote sleep during night time with no sleep architectures disturbances. it would also provoke a negligible recurrence of insomnia on discontinuation of
treatment and no rebound effects or withdrawal symptoms. orexins have been shown to play a crucial role in
sleep physiology and seem the correct target for novel
therapies for insomnia. the recent development of
doras has shown very promising results in animal
models and humans, although some concerns regarding their safety have been raised. furthermore, orexins
not only play a role in sleep–wake cycle regulation, but
are also involved in a wide variety of neurological
functions. these include the control of energetic
homeostasis, the regulation of biological rhythms,
pain reception, the activity of the hpa axis, the reward
system as well as learning, motivation and addiction.
orexin receptors show a wide distribution in the central nervous system and are all modulated by the
different doras; therefore, going far beyond a simple
sleep regulator effect. for instance, orexins are able to
activate the hpa both via  xxxg1801xxx  release promotion and direct  xxxg1031xxx -mediated
stimulation of adrenal cortex secretion (kuru et al.,
2000; spinazzi et al., 2006). there are also suggestions
that hpa stimulation by orexin a could be mediated
through the release of  xxxg1590xxx  (russel et al.,
2001). although the hpa system may probably be
involved in sleep modulation, data concerning its
role in this process are rather conﬂicting (katayama
et al., 2010; lattova et al., 2011). glucocorticoid effects
seem to be dose dependent, low doses decrease

corresponding with an increase in light sws phase 1
and deep delta sws phase 2 as well as a trend increase
in ps (coleman et al., 2012; winrow et al., 2012).
sws phase 1 and 2 latencies were reduced, whereas
ps latency showed a tendency to decrease. in comparison to almorexant, mk-6096 has higher bioavailability
and a cerebrospinal ﬂuid:plasma ratio. in addition, it
induces somnolence in dogs at markedly lower doses
than almorexant. it is also noteworthy that mk-6096
binds human orexin receptors more rapidly (approx.
2-fold) than almorexant (winrow et al., 2012).
although only few data are available yet, this novel
dora has a promising preclinical proﬁle.
