relative efficacy of prenalterol and  xxxd2964xxx  for beta-1 adrenoceptors: measurement of agonist affinity by alteration of receptor number.  both prenalterol and  xxxd2964xxx  are partial agonists (when compared to  xxxd2401xxx ) in rat left atria. schild analysis with the  xxxg91xxx  selective antagonist atenolol indicated that all three agonists stimulate beta-1 adrenoceptors in this preparation. atria from rats implanted with mini-osmotic pumps which delivered  xxxd2401xxx  (400 micrograms kg-1 hr-1) s.c. for 4 days were 9 times less sensitive than control, to  xxxd2401xxx , and produced no responses to either prenalterol or  xxxd2964xxx . schild analysis with atenolol on these desensitized atria indicated a homogeneous population of beta-1 adrenoceptors. in the desensitized atria, both prenalterol and  xxxd2964xxx  functioned as competitive antagonists of responses to  xxxd2401xxx  and schild analysis yielded estimates of the equilibrium dissociation constants (kp) of prenalterol (0.09 micron) and  xxxd2964xxx  (2 micron) in these tissues. the estimates of kp were utilized to calculate the relative efficacy of  xxxd2964xxx  and prenalterol;  xxxd2964xxx  was shown to have 2.3 times the efficacy of prenalterol on beta-1 adrenoceptors. the implications of this method as a means of calculating the kp for partial agonists are discussed. these data also serve as a caveat to the use of  xxxd2964xxx  in the determination of functional cardiac beta adrenoceptor subtypes in experimental animals and in man.
