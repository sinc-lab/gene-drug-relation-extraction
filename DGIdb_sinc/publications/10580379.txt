abstract—the effects of the antidepressant drugs  xxxd3555xxx , imipramine, maprotiline or  xxxd2746xxx  on.
mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (mao) activity in mouse, rat, dog and monkey brains were compared in
vitro. mouse, rat, dog and monkey brain mao-b activities were inhibited by  xxxd3555xxx  more potently than
mao.-a activity. imipramine inhibited mao-b more potently than mao-a activity in mouse and rat
brains. when dog and monkey brains were investigated, mao-a activity was inhibited more potently than
mao-b activity at high concentrations of imipramine, while at low concentrations, mao-b activity was
more potently inhibited. maprotiline and  xxxd2746xxx  inhibited mouse and rat brain mao-b activity more
potently than mao-a activity, while the inverse was true for dog and monkey brains. all four drugs are
competitive inhibitors of mao-a, but noncompetitive inhibitors of mao-b in all animal brains. the
respective k; values of these reagents for monkey brain mao-a and mao-b were low compared to those of
mouse, rat and dog. these results indicate that monkey brain maos are more sensitive to antidepressant

drugs than those in rodent brain.

various antidepressant drugs have been developed, and
their antidepressive effects have been observed in animal
models. antidepressant drugs have heretofore been con-
sidered effective in the treatment of depression because
they inhibit the active uptake of amines into the
presynaptic cells of the brain (1, 2). it is known that
 xxxd3555xxx  is a dicyclic antidepressant and also a selective
serotonin uptake inhibitor, imipramine is a tricyclic anti-
depressant and inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin
uptake, maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant and a
selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, and nomifen-
sine is a noncyclic antidepressant and inhibits norepi-
nephrine and dopamine uptake. it has been demonstrated
that tricyclic antidepressant drugs inhibit monoamine
oxidase (mao), particularly mao-b in vitro, and this in-
hibition may be important in the long-term use of these
drugs, in vivo (3, 4). previously, we reported that mao-
a was inhibited by the following drugs (in ascending
order of potency): imipramine, maprotiline,  xxxd3555xxx 
and viloxazine, while mao-b was inhibited by the fol-
lowing drugs (in ascending order of potency): imipra-
mine, maprotiline,  xxxd3555xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx  in vitro
(5). we also demonstrated that all four drugs are com-
petitive inhibitors of mao-a, noncompetitive inhibitors

115

of mao-b, and are more potent for mao-b in mouse
brain (5).

the present study was conducted to determine whether
or not the dicyclic drug  xxxd3555xxx , the tricyclic drug im-
ipramine, the tetracyclic drug maprotiline, and the non-
cyclic drug  xxxd2746xxx  inhibit mao activity in rat, dog
and monkey brains in a way similar to their inhibition in
mouse brain in vitro.

materials and methods

drugs

the following drugs, donated by the manufacturers,
were used in the study:  xxxd3555xxx  hydrochloride (fuji-
sawa, osaka), imipramine and maprotiline hydrochloride
(ciba-geigy, takarazuka) and  xxxd2746xxx  maleate
(hoechst, frankfurt, germany). all other chemicals were
obtained from wako pure chemical industries (osaka).

hydroxytryptamine binoxalate ({2-“c], 5-ht; 1.48-2.22
gbq/mmol) and {f-phenylethylamine hydrochloride
(fethyl-1-“c], 8-pea; 1.48-2.22 gbq/mmol), were
purchased from dupont nen (new england nuclear)
products (boston, ma, usa).

enzyme preparation

the mice (ddy male, 7 weeks, n=5) and rats (wistar
male, 7 weeks, n=5) were sacrificed by decapitation and
then their brains were quickly removed. adult male
mongrel dogs (3- to 5-year-old, n=3) and japanese
monkeys (macaca fuscata, male, 3- to 6-year-old, n=3),
donated by the animal center, oita medical university,
were killed by blood depletion under ketamine (30
mg/kg, i.m.) anesthesia, and their brains were quickly
removed. the brains were homogenized in 10 vol 0.32 m
sucrose solution (previously adjusted to ph 7.4 with 0.5
m nahco,). mitochondrial fractions were prepared by
differential centrifugation (6, 7). the mitochondria were
washed twice by resuspension in 0.32 m sucrose solution
and were used as the enzyme preparations. all operations
were carried out at 4°c. this study was performed ac-
cording to the oita medical university guidelines for the
care and use of laboratory animals.

assay of mao activity

the mao activity was measured using the labeled sub-
strates [*c]-s-ht and ['*c]-8-pea, as described pre-
viously (6, 7). for investigating the effects of these anti-
depressant drugs on mao activity in vitro, the enzyme
was preincubated for 20 min at 25°c with antidepressants
at concentrations of 1.0mm to 1.0 um before adding the
substrates. the remaining mao activity was measured
after the substrates were added. reaction was initiated by
adding 25 wl of substrate including labelled 5-ht or £-
pea, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°.
the reaction was then stopped by adding hydrochloric
acid (2n). the reaction products were extracted with 2
ml of benzene-ethyl acetate (1:1, volume/volume). triton
x-100-toluene scintillation liquid (10 ml) was added to
1.0 ml samples of the extract, and the radioactivity was
measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. enzyme
activity was expressed as nmol/min per milligram of pro-
tein. to determine the mechanism by which mao activ-
ity was inhibited by the drugs investigated, the effects of
various concentrations of antidepressants on mao activ-
ity in the mitochondria of mouse, rat, dog and monkey
brains were studied in vitro using 5-ht (for assay of
mao.-a activity) and 8-pea (for assay of mao-b activ-
ity) as substrates.

measurement of protein

the protein concentrations of the enzyme preparations
were measured according to the method of lowry et al.
(8) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. the pro-
tein concentration of the enzyme preparations was ad-
justed to 1.0 mg/ml.

statistics

all values are expressed as the mean+s.e.m. the sig-
nificance between mao-a activity and mao-b activity
in the in vitro experiments was determined by dunnett’s
t-test or student’s t-test. p values of 0.05 or less were
considered statistically significant.

results

effects of antidepressant drugs on mao activity in vitro
 xxxd3555xxx : both mao-a and mao-b activities were
inhibited in all the animal species investigated in a dose-
dependent manner. the residual activities of mao-a
were about 40%, 50%, 25% and 10% with 1.0mm
 xxxd3555xxx , while the residual activities of mao-b were
about 35%, 40%, 40% and 20% in mouse, rat, dog and
monkey brains, respectively (fig. 1).  xxxd3555xxx  inhibited
mao-b activity more potently than mao-a activity,
although the inhibition curve of mao-a was identical to
that of mao-b using mitochondria from dog brain.

imipramine: both mao-a and mao-b activities in
the brains of the four animal species also were inhibited in
a dose-dependent manner. the residual mao-a activities
were about 30%, 25%, 10% and 5% with 1.0 mm im-
ipramine, while the residual mao-b activities were about
15%, 10%, 30% and 20%, respectively (fig. 2). imipra-
mine inhibited mao-b activity more potently than
mao.-a activity in mouse and rat brain mitochondria.
when dog and monkey brain mitochondria were used for
the enzyme preparations, mao-a activity was inhibited
more potently than mao-b activity with 1 mm and 100
um (in monkey) and 1.0 mm (in dog) concentrations of
imipramine, while  xxxd1891xxx  7m imipramine, mao-b activ-
ity in monkey brain was inhibited more potently.

maprotiline: maprotiline potently inhibited both
mao-a and mao-b activities in the brains of four
animal species in a dose-dependent manner; using 1.0
mm of maprotiline, the residual activity was recorded
as follows: about 35%, 25%, 0% and 10%, (mao-a
activity) and about 20%, 15%, 35% and 35% (mao-b
activity, fig. 3), respectively. maprotiline also inhibited
mao-b activity more potently than mao-a activity in
mouse and rat brain mitochondria. however, when dog
and monkey brain mitochondria were used for the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  preparations, mao-a activity was inhibited more
potently than mao-b activity with the drug at 100 um
and 1.0mm.

 xxxd2746xxx : the residual mao-a activities were
about 60%, 70%, 30% and 25% with 1.0mm nomifen-
sine, while the residual mao-b activities were all about
50% (fig. 4). when mouse and rat brains were investi-
gated, mao-b activity was inhibited more potently than
mao-a, while mao-a activity in dog and monkey

kinetics of the inhibition of mitochondrial mao in the
brains of different animal species by various antidepres-
sant drugs, in vitro

the kinetics of the inhibition of mao in brain
mitochondria of four animal species upon the addition of
each of the four antidepressants were investigated using
lineweaver-burk double-reciprocal plots. the results
using 5-ht and 8-pea as substrates are shown in figs. 5
and 6, respectively. all of these antidepressants are com-
petitive inhibitors of mitochondrial mao-a in mouse,
rat, dog and monkey brains, whereas all these drugs are
noncompetitive inhibitors of mao-b. the respective
k, values were calculated by the method of dixon and
expressed as the mean+s.e.m. for determinations in
mouse, rat, dog and monkey brains from the apparent
michaelis constants (figs. 5 and 6), and the results are
shown in table 1.

 xxxd3555xxx : the k; values for both mao-a and b ac-
tivities in monkey brain were lower than the values for the
other animal species.

imipramine: the k; values for mao-a activity in dog
and monkey brains and for mao-b activity in monkey
and rat brains were lower than the value for the other
animal species. when rat brain was used for the enzyme
preparation, the k; value for mao-a activity was higher

maprotiline: the k; values for mao-a activity in dog
and monkey brains also were low, while those for mao-
b activity in rat and monkey brains were much lower than
the values for the other animal species. when rat brain
was used for the enzyme preparation, the k; value for
mao.-a activity was higher than that for mao-b activ-
ity, while in dog, the k; values for mao-b activity were
higher than that for mao-a activity.

 xxxd2746xxx : the k; value for mao-a activity in
monkey brain was much lower than the values for the
other animal species.  xxxd2746xxx  showed high k; values
for mao-b activity in all the animal species. when

tions, the k; values for mao-a activity were higher than
those for mao-b activity, while in dog and monkey, the
k, values for mao-b activity were higher than those for
mao-a activity.

more potent for mao-b than mao-a (9). previously,
we reported that mouse brain mao-b was inhibited by
dicyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic and non-cyclic antidepres-
sant drugs more strongly than mao-a (5). in the present
study, we demonstrated that the inhibiting action of vari-
ous antidepressants differs depending on animal species.
that is, mouse, rat, dog and monkey brain mao-b
activity were inhibited by the dicyclic antidepressant
 xxxd3555xxx  more potently than mao-a activity. the tri-
cyclic antidepressant imipramine inhibited mao-b activ-
ity more potently than that of mao-b in mouse and rat
brains. when dog and monkey brains were used for the

enzyme preparations, mao-a activity was inhibited
more potently than mao-b activity at high concentra-
tions of imipramine, while at low concentrations, mao-
b activity was more potently inhibited. however, when
the tetracyclic and non-cyclic antidepressants maprotiline
and  xxxd2746xxx  were used, mouse and rat brain mao-b
activities were inhibited more potently than mao-a
activity, while dog and monkey brain mao-a activities
were inhibited more potently than mao-b activities. it
is not clear how the different mao inhibition by these
antidepressants occurs. the flavin-containing mao is a
membrane-bound mitochondrial enzyme that exists in

 
 

antidepressant and animal species mao 121

two forms, mao-a and mao-b. two forms of mao
activity have been described on the basis of substrate
specificity and drug sensitivity. the two forms of mao
have subunits of similar molecular mass (55-65 kda)
with the a form being about 3-kda larger than the b-
form (10).  xxxd2112xxx  (fad)-bearing
subunits of these two forms differ in their peptide maps
(11). it is also known that the mao-a/mao-b ratio
varies greatly from one animal species to another and also
one organ to another, although the high levels of both
forms are found in the brain for most species (12).
moreover,  xxxd1730xxx  (13), a selective mao-a inhibitor,
and deprenyl (14), a selective mao-b inhibitor, inhibit
the enzyme by forming a covalently linked inhibitor
flavin-adduct in a ratio of 1:1 (15), like that formed with
 xxxd2850xxx , a selective mao inhibitor. however, anti-
depressants used in the present experiment were not
specific mao inhibitors and did not bind to the  xxxd135xxx -
enzyme. thus, it was necessary to use high concentrations
of antidepressants to inhibit mao activity. it may be
related to differences in the chemical structures (dicyclic,
tricyclic, tetracyclic and non-cyclic structure) of these
antidepressants or to the differences in the binding sites
for these antidepressants in the particular animal species
used in the present experiments.

to determine the mechanism of mao inhibition by the
four types of antidepressant drugs, the effects of various
concentrations of these reagents on mao activities in the
mitochondria of mouse, rat, dog and monkey brains were
studied in vitro. in this study, lineweaver-burk double-
reciprocal plot analysis also showed that these reagents
are competitive inhibitors of mitochondrial mao-a in
the brains of all animal species investigated, but the re-
agents are noncompetitive inhibitors of mao-b. these
findings agree with a previous report stating that various
antidepressants are competitive inhibitors of mitochon-
drial mao-a in mouse brain, but the reagents are
non-competitive inhibitors of mao-b (6). moreover,
edwards and burns (4) also reported that the inhibition
of mao by antidepressants, including tricyclics, as dem-
onstrated by kinetic studies as well as by dialysis studies,
is reversible. these in vitro observations, suggest that
multiple, large doses of antidepressants do not directly
alter mao by competitive or noncompetitive binding,
but instead cause conformational changes in the mao
molecule itself.

the respective k; values of these antidepressants for
monkey brain mao-a and mao-b activities were very
low compared to those for mouse, rat and dog. in addi-
tion, the k; values of these reagents for monkey brain
mao.-a activity were lower than the k,, value by about
83 um (mao-a k,, value), calculated using lineweaver-
burk plots. from these results, it appeared that the anti-

depressant drugs were more potent for monkey brain
mitochondrial mao when compared with the maos of
other animal species investigated. we also found that
when monkey brain mao-a was used for the enzyme
preparation, the potency of mao inhibition was 10 times
greater for imipramine, 20 times greater for maprotiline
and 40 times greater for  xxxd2746xxx  than the potencies
of these drugs in rodent brain.
