synthesis and biological activity of spin-labeled analogs of biotin,

spin-labeled analogs of biotin ( xxxd344xxx ), hexamethonium,  xxxd1820xxx , dichlorisoproterenol, propranolol, and
primaquine containing the nitroxide free radical have been synthesized and tested for biological activity. the four
spin-labeled analogs of biotin, 4-biotinamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy
(iv), 3-biotinamido-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy(v), 3-biotinamidomethyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-l-pyrrolidinyloxy
(vi), and 4-(biotinylglycyl)amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy
(vii), all interacted with avidin, a specific biotin binding protein
found in raw egg white, at the same sites as did biotin itself. an unsymmetrical  xxxd1820xxx  spin label (xviii) in
which one of the quaternary methyl groups had been replaced by the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy)
moiety
was 13 times more potent as an inhibitor of torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase than the parent drug. the symmetrical  xxxd1820xxx  (xvi) and hexamethonium (xiv) spin labels were 18 and 1.8 times as active as  xxxd1820xxx  in the same assay system. the substitution of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy)
group for the isopropyl groups of &adrenergic blocking drugs dichlorisoproterenol and propranolol, to give spin labels xxi and xxii,
caused a 45 and 54% reduction, respectively, in the ability of these compounds t o inhibit the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated
activity of rat fat cell membranes. finally, modification of primaquine by the introduction of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy)substituent into the amino group of the butyl side chain completely abolished the ahility of
the drug to bind t o nucleic acids. these results suggest that the incorporation of the nitroxide group into drug molecules may be a useful approach t o the synthesis of more specific spin labels for biological systems, such as egg white
avidin, acetylcholinesterase, and the /?-adrenergic receptor.
during recent years spin-labeled drug molecules have
played a n increasingly important role in studies of t h e interaction of drugs with their cellular targets or “receptor”
macromolecules.1-5 spin-labeled drugs have also been used
t o determine t h e levels of morphine, barbiturates, sulfonamides, a n d other drugs in biological f l ~ i d s t. h~ e~ most

commonly employed spin labels utilize the nitroxide group,

procedures for synthesizing spin-labeled analogs of sulfonamides, acetylcholine, a n d barbituric acid. w e now report

discussion
egg white avidin is a tetrameric protein (mass 68,000
daltons) which binds four molecules of b i ~ t i n l " ~ (vitamin
*
h). green has shown15 t h a t when 2-(4'-hydroxyazobenzene) xxxd306xxx  (haba) binds to avidin t h e absorption
maximum of the dye shifts from 348 to 480 nm. each avidin molecule has four binding sites for haba from which
t h e dye can be displaced by biotin.15 t h e addition of biotin
spin label iv to a haba-avidin complex resulted in t h e
displacement of an equivalent amount of dye. similar results were obtained with labels v-vii. t h e interaction of
biotin spin labels iv-vi1 was also monitored by means of
optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.16 these
experiments clearly demonstrated t h a t t h e biotin spin labels occupied the same binding sites as did biotin.

a n d x x i i was assayed by measuring their ability t o inhibit
t h e  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated increase in adenylyl cyclase
activity of r a t f a t cell membranes. it can be seen from
t a b l e i1 t h a t t h e replacement of t h e n-isopropyl group of
dichlorisoproterenol a n d propranolol by the more bulky piperidyl moiety caused a decrease in @-adrenergic blocking
activity.
t h e electron spin resonance spectra of solutions containing t h e primaquine analog (xxiii) a n d either yeast rna

t h e introduction, into a drug molecule, of t h e nitroxide

leave t h e biological activity of t h e drug unchanged, (ii) enhance t h e biological activity of t h e drug, or (iii) partially or
completely abolish the biological activity of t h e drug. in

chcl,r solution extracted with dilute hc1. the acid solution was
made basic with dilute naoh and extracted with chc1:j. the
chc1:j solution was dried (nazs04) and the solvent removed to
give 0.52 g (98%) of pure xi (gc-ms, ir) as a red oil.

contained acetylcholine (0.25 mm), nacl (0.1 m),
mgclz (40 mm),
and tris-hc1 buffer, ph 8.0 (10 mm). the initial rate of acetylcholine hydrolysis was measured at 22' in the absence of (ko) and
presence ( k , ) of increasing inhibitor concentrations. the ki value
(le., the concentration of drug producing 50% inhibition of enzyme
activity) for each spin label was determined graphically from a plot
of log [(kolk,) - 11 against log [spin label]. the following concentration ranges were employed: xiv, 10-6-10-4 m; xvi, 6 x 10v-6
x 10-6 m ; xviii, io-'-10-5 m ; xx, 10-5-10-3 m .
