abstract
abnormal activity of the cardiac  xxxg2161xxx  ( xxxg2161xxx ) can aﬀect intracellular ca2+ homeostasis and cause arrhythmias.
the n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas), however, may prevent arrhythmias. to test the eﬀect of pufas on the cardiac  xxxg2161xxx 
current (incx1), the canine  xxxg2161xxx  cdna was expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek293t) cells. the average density of incx1
was 10.9 ± 2.6 pa/pf (n = 44) in  xxxg2161xxx -transfected cells and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa, c20:5n-3) signiﬁcantly inhibited incx1.
the suppression of incx1 by epa was concentration-dependent with an ic50 of 0.82 ± 0.27 lm. epa had a similar eﬀect on outward
or inward incx1. docosahexaenoic acid (dha, c22:6n-3) and  xxxd208xxx  (aa, c20:4n-6) also signiﬁcantly inhibited incx1,
whereas the saturated fatty acid,  xxxd3244xxx  (sa,  xxxd3244xxx ), did not. our data demonstrate that the n-3 pufas signiﬁcantly suppress
cardiac incx1, which is probably one of their protective eﬀects against lethal arrhythmias.

a major cause of death in patients with chronic heart
failure is sudden cardiac death that is actually more
common among patients with a less severe degree of
the disease and accounts for more than half of total
mortality from chronic heart failure [1,2]. several studies
have shown that  xxxg2161xxx  is elevated at the transcript, protein, and activity levels in several models of cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure [3–5]. increased activity
of  xxxg2161xxx  may contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis,
particularly in its reverse mode. delayed after-depolarizations (dads) and early after-depolarizations (eads)
have been observed in failing hearts. in the rabbit and
dog heart failure models, enhanced  xxxg2161xxx  activity
may lead to the increased occurrence of dads and triggered arrhythmias [6,7]. eads, however, mainly result

from the loss of repolarizing k+ currents, whereas enhanced ncx currents are beneﬁcial [8]. intracellular
ca2+ overload is one of the major causes of ischemiareperfusion injury and arrhythmias. in langendorﬀperfused whole rabbit hearts, the  xxxg2161xxx  inhibitor
kb-r7943 almost completely blocked ventricular arrhythmias (tachycardia and ﬁbrillation) associated with
both ischemia and reperfusion, indicating a critical role
for  xxxg2161xxx  in the events [9]. therefore, it will be a great
beneﬁt to heart failure patients if the natural n-3 ﬁsh oil
 xxxd2154xxx  inhibit the  xxxg2161xxx  currents.
we have found that the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in ﬁsh oil, namely  xxxd2318xxx 
(c20:5n-3, epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (c22:6n-3,
dha), are anti-arrhythmic in animals [10–14] and probably in humans [15–19]. because of the importance of
ncx in the heart, it behooves us to learn if these ﬁsh
oil  xxxd2154xxx  will modulate the actions of ncx, as this

may be an important role of these  xxxd2154xxx  in their
beneﬁcial actions on the heart. therefore, we have utilized the availability of the dog  xxxg2161xxx  cdna [20] expressed in hek293t cells to learn if polyunsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  speciﬁcally modulate the activity of ncx.

materials and methods
cell culture and transient transfection of  xxxg2161xxx  cdna. hek293t
cells were cultured in dulbeccoõs modiﬁed eagleõs medium (dmem)
according to the method described previously [21,22]. cloned canine
cardiac cnx1 cdna of the  xxxg2161xxx  (generously provided
by dr. philipsonõs laboratory) was transfected into hek293t cells with
a calcium phosphate precipitation method [21,22]. a reporter plasmid
cd8-pih3m (1 lg, cell surface antigen) and  xxxg2161xxx  cdna clone (3 lg)
in the pcdna1/amp vector were prepared in 250 mm cacl2, added to
a test tube containing 0.36 ml hbs (2·) solution (in mm): 274 nacl, 40
hepes, 12 dextrose, and 10 kcl, 1.4 na2hpo4, ph 7.05, and incubated
at 22 c for 20 min. the dna solution was then dripped over a cell
culture of a ti-25 ﬂask containing 7 ml of the culture solution. the
transfection was satisfactory under these conditions [22]. the transfected cells were trypsinized and replated 15 h later to an appropriate
density in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (which also served as recording
chambers) containing 2 ml of fresh dmem. transfected cells were
incubated at 37 c in air with 5% co2 added and 98% relative
humidity and used within 4 days. transfection-positive cells which were
identiﬁed by binding immunobeads (cd8-dynabeads m-450, dynal
a.s., oslo, norway) coated with a monoclonal antibody (iti-5c2)
speciﬁc for cd8 antigen were selected for patch-clamp experiments.
recording of  xxxg2161xxx  currents. during an experiment hek293t cells
plated in a culture dish were continuously superfused (1–2 ml/min) with
tyrodeõs solution (in mm): nacl 137, kcl 5, mgcl2 1, cacl2 1.5,
hepes 10, and glucose 10, ph 7.4. recording glass electrodes had a
resistance of 0.7–1.2 mx when ﬁlled with the pipette solution and were
connected via ag–agcl wire to an axopatch 200b ampliﬁer (axon
instruments, ca). cells coated with cd-8 beads were chosen for patch
clamps. after forming a conventional ‘‘gigaseal’’ the capacitance of an
electrode was compensated. additional suction was used to form the
whole-cell conﬁguration. the capacitance (26.3 ± 1.2 pf, n = 96) of cells
was measured with the pclamp software (version 8.02, axon instruments, ca). correction of cell capacitance and series resistance
was performed before data collection. experimental voltage-clamp
protocols were similar to those used in other studies [23,24]. with a
membrane potential at 0 mv, outward or inward incx1 was triggered
by changing extracellular concentration of ca2+ from 0 to 1 mm or
na+ from 0 to 145 mm, respectively. the ramp  xxxg2161xxx  current was
recorded by pulses from a holding potential of 40 mv to a 100-ms
step depolarization to +60 mv, then to a descending voltage ramp to
100 mv (from +60 to 100 mv at 100 mv/s) and a step back to
40 mv. the descending portion of the ramp (from +60 to 100 mv)
was used to plot the current–voltage (i–v) relation curve. the magnitudes of incx1 were measured at the voltages near +60 mv and
100 mv and compared in the absence or presence of  xxxd2154xxx .
external solutions with or without  xxxd2154xxx  were exchanged rapidly
with a perfusion system described previously [21,22]. experiments were
conducted at 22–23 c.
materials and solutions. the experimental concentrations of fatty
acids (sigma, st. louis, mo) were obtained by dilution of the stocks
that were prepared weekly in ethanol  xxxd1891xxx  mm and stored under a
nitrogen atmosphere at 20 c. the dilution contained negligible
ethanol which had no eﬀect on  xxxg2161xxx  currents. the pipette solution
for recording the reverse (outward) exchange currents contained (in
mm): nacl 120, kcl 5, mgcl2 2, tea-cl 20, hepes 10, glucose 8,
na2atp 1, ph 7.3, and egta 5 plus cacl2 4.28 (1 lm free ca2+) and

the bath solution contained (in mm): licl 145, mgcl2 2, tea-oh 10,
hepes 10, and glucose 10, ph 7.4, with either 0.5 mm egta (<1 nm
free ca2+) or 1 mm cacl2 [16]. the pipette solution for recording
forward (inward) exchange currents contained (in mm): nacl 20,
csoh 100, kcl 5, mgcl2 2, tea-cl 20, hepes 10, glucose 8, na2atp
1, ph 7.3, and egta 5 plus cacl2 4.94 (5 lm free ca2+) and the bath
solution contained (in mm): nacl 145, mgcl2 1, cacl2 1.0, egta
0.5, hepes 10, and glucose 10, ph 7.4 (0.5 mm free ca2+). the pipette
solution for recording ramp incx1 was the same as that for recording
forward (inward) exchange currents and the bath solution contained
(in mm): nacl 137, kcl 5, mgcl2 1, cacl2 1.5, hepes 10, and glucose
10, ph 7.4.
data analysis and statistics. the amplitude of peak incx1 in forward or reverse mode was measured and analyzed. current density,
pa/pf, of incx1 of each cell was calculated by dividing the amplitude
of peak current by the cell membrane capacitance. the normalized
incx1 after the treatment with pufas was calculated as i(pufas)/
i(control) from the same cell. the reversal potential of incx1 was calculated by the equation,  xxxg2031xxx  = 3ena 2eca. data are presented as
means ± sem and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(anova) or by un-paired studentõs t test. statistical signiﬁcance was
set at the level of p < 0.05.

na+/ca 2+ exchange currents in hek293t cells transfected with  xxxg2161xxx  cdna
to determine whether there was an endogenous
incx1 in hek293t cells, we recorded the outward
whole-cell incx1 at a holding potential of 0 mv. nontransfected hek293t cells had no obvious outward currents when the external solution was switched from
0 mm [ca2+]o to 1 mm [ca2+]o (fig. 1a, control cell).
the average density of incx1 in the control hek293t
cells was 0.06 ± 0.02 pa/pf (n = 16, fig. 1b, control).
however, in the hek293t cells with transfection of
the canine  xxxg2161xxx  cdna, signiﬁcant outward currents
were elicited when the extracellular solution was
switched from 0 mm ca2+ to 1 mm ca2+ (fig. 1a,
 xxxg2161xxx -transfected cell). the average density of incx1
in the transfected hek293t cells was 10.9 ± 2.6 pa/pf
(n = 44, p < 0.001, versus the control; fig. 1b). these results demonstrate that after  xxxg2161xxx -cdna transfection,
the hek293t cells expressed signiﬁcant amount of
na+/ca2+ exchange currents.
inhibition of incx1 by epa
our previous data show that the n-3 polyunsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) prevent ventricular arrhythmias in
dogs [25] and inhibit na+, ca2+, and k+ currents in isolated mammalian cardiomyocytes [26–28]. cardiac na+/
ca2+ exchanger is the primary ca2+ extrusion mechanism in the heart [29] and dramatically aﬀects membrane
action potentials [30]. to assess the eﬀects of pufas on
incx1, we transfected the canine  xxxg2161xxx  cdna into
hek293t cells. fig. 2 shows that outward incx1 at a

cdna ( xxxg2161xxx -transfected cell). the components of the pipette and
bath solutions for recording outward incx1 were described in
materials and methods. to elicit outward incx1, the 0 mm ca2+external solution was switched to one with 1 mm [ca2+]o. the membrane
potential was held at 0 mv. (b) the averaged amplitudes of peak

holding potential of 0 mv was elicited by switching the
external solution from 0 mm [ca2+]o to 1 mm [ca2+]o
in a control (panel a) and an epa-treated (panel b)
hek293t cells. in the absence of epa, outward incx1
did not show a signiﬁcant rundown during the 5-min observation. in the presence of 30 lm epa, however, outward incx1 was signiﬁcantly inhibited (fig. 2b). the
inhibition of outward incx1 initiated within 30 s and
reached the maximal eﬀect in 4 min after external application of 30 lm epa. outward incx1 recovered toward
the control level after washout of epa with the bath solution containing 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (figs. 2b
and c).
inhibition of incx1 by epa was concentration-dependent. fig. 3 shows the inhibition of outward incx1
in  xxxg2161xxx -transfected hek293t cells treated with diﬀerent concentrations of epa. the ic50 of epa for
incx1was 0.82 ± 0.27 lm. these results indicate that
epa is a signiﬁcant and highly potent inhibitor of the
outward current of cardiac na+/ca2+ exchangers.
epa-induced inhibition of incx1 in both forward and
reverse modes
as our above results show that epa signiﬁcantly inhibited the outward current, a reverse mode of incx1
(figs. 1–3), we applied a ramp protocol (upper panels
in figs. 4a and b) to elicit voltage-dependent incx1

and to assess whether epa inhibited both reverse (outward current) and forward (inward current) modes of
the current. fig. 4a shows that the amplitude of the
control ramp-activated incx1 was signiﬁcantly reduced
in the presence of 5 lm epa (fig. 4a, epa). the inhibition initiated within 20 s and reached the maximal effect around 4 min after external application of 5 lm
epa. epa at 5 lm reduced incx1 by 82.5 ± 2.3%
(n = 13, p < 0.001) for the reverse mode and 80.0 ± 3.4%
(n = 13, p < 0.01) for the forward mode in  xxxg2161xxx -transfected hek293t cells (fig. 4b). recovery of incx1 toward the control level was observed after washout of
epa for 3–5 min with the external solution containing
0.2% bovine fetal albumin (figs. 4a and b, washout).
to evaluate the eﬀect of the ncx blocker nickel on
incx1, we added 5 mm nicl2 into the extracellular solution. incx1 was signiﬁcantly inhibited after the perfusion with ni2+ in  xxxg2161xxx -transfected hek293t cells
(fig. 4c). nicl2 at 5 mm inhibited incx1 by
90.0 ± 2.6% (n = 9, p < 0.001) for the reverse mode and
87.8 ± 2.9% (n = 9, p < 0.01) for the forward mode of
 xxxg2161xxx  (fig. 4d). the inhibited current was returned
to the control level after washout of ni2+. compared
with the eﬀect of epa on incx1, ni2+ produced a similar
level of inhibition, but more recovery of the inhibited
incx1 was observed in hek293t cells treated with
5 mm ni2+ than with 5 lm epa (figs. 4b and d).
to further test the eﬀects of epa on the forward
mode of incx1 (inward), we held the membrane potential at 0 mv and switched the external solution from
0 mm [na+]o to 145 mm [na+]o in  xxxg2161xxx -transfected
hek293t cells. fig. 5 shows that a signiﬁcant inward
current was elicited when the extracellular solution
was switched from 0 to 145 mm na+ (fig. 5a). the amplitude of inward incx1 was signiﬁcantly inhibited after
extracellular application of 10 lm epa (fig. 5b). the
inhibition of inward incx1 initiated within 30 s and
reached the maximal eﬀect in 4 min after extracellular
perfusion of 10 lm epa. the average inhibition of inward incx1 caused by 10 lm epa was 77.8 ± 5.0%
(fig. 5c, n = 13, p < 0.001), which was similar to that
(88.9 ± 4.9%, fig. 3) of outward incx1 in the presence
of 10 lm epa. signiﬁcant recovery of inhibited inward
incx1 by epa was observed after washout of epa with
the external solution containing 0.2% bovine fetal albumin (fig. 5c, 71.8 ± 24.5%).
eﬀects of other  xxxd2154xxx  on incx1
to evaluate the eﬀects of other polyunsaturated or
saturated  xxxd2154xxx  on incx1, docosahexaenoic acid
(dha, c22:6n-3),  xxxd208xxx  (aa, c20:4n-6),
and  xxxd3244xxx  (sa,  xxxd3244xxx ) were applied to ncx1transfected hek293t cells. fig. 6 shows that other
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  also signiﬁcantly reduced
outward incx1 in hek293t cells transfected with

switching the external solution from 0 mm [ca2+]o to 1 mm [ca2+]o as described in fig. 1. outward incx1 did not signiﬁcantly run down during 5-min

from the  xxxg2161xxx -transfected hek293t cells shown in (a,b). the values of outward incx1 in (c) were normalized to their corresponding control

not signiﬁcantly alter outward incx1 (6.9 ± 17.5% inhibition, n = 5, p > 0.05). these results indicate that pufas
could signiﬁcantly and speciﬁcally inhibit incx1 in
 xxxg2161xxx -transfected hek293t cells.

the n-6  xxxd208xxx  (aa), but not by the saturated
fatty acid,  xxxd3244xxx . it had been shown [31] that polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  of both the n-3 and n-6 classes are
antiarrhythmic, but aa proved to be anomalous. in
about a third of the experiments it proved to be proarrhythmic. however, the arrhythmias were not the direct
result of the aa, but rather were caused by cyclooxygenase products of aa. when cycloxygenase was inhibited
by indomethacin, the aa was only antiarrhythmic. later
it was shown [32] that the prostaglandins formed from
aa were all proarrhythmic, whereas the prostaglandins
formed from epa were not. this is the reason we have
stressed the importance of the n-3 ﬁsh oil  xxxd2154xxx 
for clinical use and not the n-6  xxxd2154xxx .
we had previously shown that the n-3 ﬁsh oil fatty
acids were potent inhibitors of the l-type calcium current (ica,l) [27]. we had been assuming that the action
of these  xxxd2154xxx  in preventing triggered non-reentrant
ventricular arrhythmias resulting from delayed after po-

tentials was based on the action of the  xxxd2154xxx  on
ica,l. but the eﬀect of the n-3 ﬁsh oil  xxxd2154xxx  on inhibiting incx is much too potent to ignore. the eﬀect
of these  xxxd2154xxx  to prevent fatal arrhythmias was
clearly masking their eﬀect on incx1, as well. perhaps
the eﬀects of these  xxxd2154xxx  combine their actions on
both ica,l and on incx1 to produce the beneﬁcial action
of these  xxxd2154xxx  to prevent fatal ventricular arrhythmias. how much either eﬀect might contribute to the
beneﬁcial action, we do not now know.
there is a similar issue now with the actions of the
 xxxd2154xxx  on the cardiac toxicity from digitalis-like glycosides. one of our earliest experiments with the n-3 ﬁsh
oil  xxxd2154xxx  showed they prevented ouabain-induced
arrhythmias in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [33]. after
we found that the ﬁsh oil  xxxd2154xxx  potently inhibited
the l-type ca2+ channel currents, the prevention of cardioglycoside toxicity was attributed to inhibition of
ica,l. but it is equally logical to attribute this to inhibi-

tion of incx. indeed, it is generally accepted that cardioglycoside toxicity is caused by the action of na+/ca2+
exchangers.
with the occurrence of a myocardial infarction there
occurs a zone of ischemia. cells in the periphery of the
ischemic zone will be partially depolarized, but viable.

121

such partially depolarized cells are potentially proarrhythmic, as any further small depolarization can initiate an action potential, which may induce an
arrhythmia. ischemia has been shown to be associated
with an increased concentration of na+ in the myocytes.
this has been attributed to two factors: (1) inhibition of
the na–k-atpase sodium pump because of lack of oxygen and substrates will directly lead to increased [na+]i.
(2) ischemia is associated with intracellular acidosis due
to lactic acid accumulation. the increased intracellular
h+ has been shown to exchange for extracellular
na+[34], which would further increase intracellular
na+. this elevated intracellular na+ and the decreased
membrane potential in the partially depolarized ischemic myocyte should favor removal of the high na+ in
exchange for ca2+ entering the myocyte via the ncx
operating in the reverse mode. it seems that n-3 ﬁsh
oil would act to reduce intracellular calcium, and thereby help to prevent overload of cytosolic ca2+ and triggered arrhythmias. if so, this might act to complement
the action of the pufas to inhibit the l-type calcium
current, which accomplishes the same beneﬁcial antiarrhythmic action [27].
it seems that any cardiac dysfunction which resulted
in prolonged action potentials would enhance the
opportunity for ncx operating in reverse mode to increase [ca2+]i and promote triggered cardiac arrhythmias. just such conditions may occur in certain long
qt syndrome-associated mutations of  xxxg2028xxx  and lead
to maintained depolarizing currents and action potential
prolongation, setting up a substrate for arrhythmias
[35]. these mutant na+ channels can reopen during
the plateau of the action potential. the eﬀect is to maintain a small depolarizing ina to persist during the plateau phase and thus prolong the action potential
duration [36]. again the prolonged action potential with
the depolarized state of the membrane potential would
favor action of ncx in its reverse mode causing
[ca2+]i overload and possible triggered arrhythmias,
which can be prevented by the n-3  xxxd2154xxx .
a recent study [37] reported the eﬀects of the open
versus closed states of the gap junctures in the myocardium during reperfusion injury. blockade of l-type
ca2+ channels did not modify propagation of high
ca2+ between adjacent cells with contracture and death
of myocytes, but inhibition of the  xxxg2161xxx 
in its reverse mode did. it seems that the n-3 pufas
might have therapeutic beneﬁt by suppressing myocardial damage from reperfusion injury.
it has been pointed out [38] that the lipid environment surrounding the  xxxg2161xxx  may also
be modiﬁed during ischemia and aﬀect the transporter.
the accumulation of lysophosphatidyl-choline early following myocardial infarction increases sarcolemmal permeability to ca2+has been shown to cause arrhythmias
[39] and was shown to inﬂuence na+/ca2+ exchange

activity [40]. other changes in the sarcolemmal lipids
and fatty acid composition may have secondary eﬀects
on the  xxxg2161xxx  [40,41].
there is increasing interest for a possible role of na+/
ca2+ exchange in the pathophysiology of the failing
heart and numerous studies have been recently reported.
whether in this failing state of the heart or in other cardiac conditions the ﬁnding that the  xxxg2161xxx 
is strongly inhibited in both its forward and reverse
modes of operation by n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
will help in the understanding or treatment of these maladies remains to be seen.
