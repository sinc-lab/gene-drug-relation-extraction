abstract
the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist and gastroprokinetic,  xxxd3302xxx , possesses  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity. however, the relevance of such
activity is unclear. in this study, the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist and  xxxg1117xxx  agonist activities of  xxxd3302xxx  were investigated.
two piezoelectric crystals were implanted on the stomach fundus or oesophagus of anaesthetized sprague–dawley rats. measurement of the
transmission time of ultrasonic pulses between the implanted crystals provided a continuous record of inter-crystal distance, and thus of muscle
length.
in the stomach fundus,  xxxd3302xxx  (1 and 3 mg kg−1 ), administered subcutaneously (s.c.), inhibited the contractile response evoked by the 5ht2b receptor agonist, bw 723c86 (0.01–1 mg kg−1 intravenously (i.v.)). sb 206553 (1 mg kg−1 s.c.), a selective 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist,
also inhibited the bw 723c86-mediated responses. in the rat oesophagus,  xxxd3302xxx  (0.001–0.3 mg kg−1 i.v. or 0.003–3 mg kg−1 s.c.) increased
inter-crystal distance, consistent with smooth muscle relaxation; the responses were inhibited by the  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist,  xxxd2943xxx  (0.1 mg kg−1
s.c.).
data from this in vivo rat study are consistent with  xxxd3302xxx -induced  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated oesophageal relaxation, and antagonism of
 xxxg1114xxx -mediated stomach fundus contraction. the clinical relevance of the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonism of  xxxd3302xxx  remains to be
determined.

1. introduction
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), which originates in enterochromaffin cells and intrinsic neurons of the alimentary tract,
plays a pivotal physiological role in regulating gastrointestinal
motility via an interaction with 5-ht1 , 5-ht2 , 5-ht3 , and 5ht4 receptors [1].
activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, located on motor neurons
and interneurons in the alimentary tract results in facilitation
of gastrointestinal motility by augmenting cholinergic and nonadrenergic, non-cholinergic neurotransmission [2]. additionally, stimulation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors on smooth muscle inhibits
colonic circular muscle contractile activity in humans [3]. with
respect to the role of the  xxxg1114xxx  in gastrointestinal physiology, preclinical data indicate an involvement in the

development and function of the enteric nervous system and alimentary tract [4–6].  xxxg1114xxx  mrna and protein are
expressed in the human and rodent gastrointestinal tract [5,6],
and their activation enhances neurogenically mediated contraction of colonic longitudinal smooth muscle [5].
drug discovery efforts have identified several 5-ht ligands
with clinical efficacy in gastrointestinal disorders. the  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor agonists,  xxxd1708xxx  (propulsid® ),  xxxd3039xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx , mosapride and  xxxd3302xxx  (zelnorm® ) have demonstrated
efficacy in patients suffering disorders characterized by reduced
gastrointestinal motility [7–9]. notable amongst these agents is
 xxxd3302xxx  [10–12], which is approved in several countries for
the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in females and chronic constipation in males and females.
clinical studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3302xxx  increases gastric emptying and accelerates small intestinal and colonic transit in humans [13,14]. although the gastrointestinal actions of
 xxxd3302xxx  are attributed to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor activation, the compound binds to 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 receptors, and is a potent

354

 xxxg1114xxx  antagonist [15]. the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  could have clinical significance.
the objective of this study was to investigate the 5-ht2b
receptor antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  in vivo, and to compare
its potency in this respect to its  xxxg1117xxx  agonist activity. while the
rat stomach fundus [16] and oesophagus [17] exist for assaying,
respectively, 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist potency and
efficacy in vitro, investigation of such activity in vivo, in rodents,
is generally limited to intestinal transit or gastric emptying of test
meals containing a marker [18,19]. implanted strain gauge force
transducers have been used successfully in guinea pigs [20] to
measure “real-time” gastrointestinal contractility, although due
to the technical challenges, are more commonly used in larger
species. in this study, digital sonomicrometry was used in anticipation that it would provide a sensitive means of recording real
time changes in oesophageal and stomach fundus responsiveness in a less invasive manner than utilization of strain gauges or
other forms of tissue tension measurement. traditionally used
in cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology studies, digital sonomicrometry utilizes miniature piezoelectric crystals to
transmit and receive ultrasonic pulses, and the “time of flight” of
the sound wave is measured with high sensitivity. as the speed
of sound in biological tissue is fixed, a continuous record of
inter-crystal distance is provided, and changes in muscle length
are recorded. the in vivo sonomicrometry output (i.e. intercrystal distance) is considered equivalent to that generated by
traditional tissue bath methodology in which changes in muscle
length are recorded isotonically. the application of this technique to the gastrointestinal field has been reported recently for
measuring stomach motility in response to intravenous cholecystokinin [21].  xxxd2943xxx  ( xxxd2943xxx ) and sb 206553, selective
 xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonists, respectively [22,23]
and bw 723c86 and ␣-methyl 5-ht, selective  xxxg1114xxx 
agonists, were used to characterize definitively the pharmacological responses evoked by  xxxd3302xxx . the oesophageal activity
of  xxxd3302xxx  was compared to that produced by  xxxd1708xxx  and
mosapride, both of which are  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists [19,24].
2. materials and methods
all experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of good laboratory animal care provided by the animal care and usage committee of theravance inc. adult,
male sprague–dawley rats (250–350 g, harlan) were acclimated
to the colony room (temperature controlled at 21 ± 1 ◦ c and
12:12 h light-dark cycle commencing  xxxd2274xxx :00 am) for at least
5 days following arrival. during this period, standard rat diet
(harlan teklad) and drinking water were available ad libitum.
rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2–3%) via a nose
cone for the duration of each experiment. animals were placed
on a heated pad to maintain body temperature at 37–38 ◦ c
(monitored rectally with a sensor (physitemp bat-12)). the
right femoral vein was exposed, and a micro-renathane cannula
(mre-033) was inserted to permit i.v. administration of test
agents. a midline incision was made in the skin and muscle
layers of the abdomen to expose the stomach and oesophagus.
two piezoelectric crystals (1 mm diameter; sonometrics corp.)

were gently glued, approximately 2 mm apart, in a longitudinal
orientation, to the stomach fundus or distal oesophagus using
vetbond tissue adhesive. the wires connecting the crystals to
the measurement device (sonometrics corp. trx series 8) were
exteriorized through the abdominal incision site.
the settings for the sonometrics system were fixed within the
sonoview software (sonometrics corp. version 3.2.1) as follows: sampling rate = 99.4 hz, transmit pulse = 375 ns, inhibit
delay = 1.2–1.5 mm, velocity of sound through biological tissue = 1.59 mm ␮s−1 . drug vehicle, followed by increasing doses
of  xxxd3302xxx , bw 723c86 or ␣-methyl 5-ht (dosing volumes:
0.3–1 ml kg−1 over 3 s, i.v. or s.c.), were administered cumulatively (i.v.) or non-cumulatively (s.c., in the right flank).
 xxxd2943xxx  and sb 206553 were administered s.c., 15 min prior
to i.v. administration of  xxxd3302xxx  or bw 723c86.
changes in inter-crystal distance (in mm) were averaged for
each treatment group. from the dose–response relationship for
each agonist, an ed50 value (i.e. the dose resulting in 50% of
the maximum response) was calculated using prism graphics
software 3.0 (graphpad inc.). the data were fitted to a sigmoidal
dose–response relationship with variable slope according to the
following equation:
y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10∧ ((log ed50 − x)
×hillslope)),
where x is the logarithm of the agonist dose, y is the response,
and the bottom and top are the curve asymptotes.
 xxxd3302xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  were purchased (apin chemicals
and sequoia research products, respectively). bw 723c86,
␣-methyl 5-ht and sb 206553 were purchased from tocris
cookson.  xxxd2943xxx  and mosapride were prepared using published synthetic procedures [22,23].  xxxd2943xxx , ␣-methyl 5-ht
and sb 206553 were dissolved in 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose
in water (d5w), while  xxxd3302xxx  and mosapride were prepared
in 10 % sulfobutyl ether-beta cyclodextrin (10% sbe/cd). bw
723c86 was formulated in dmso (1% by volume) in d5w.  xxxd1708xxx  was formulated in 10% sbe-cd and  xxxd1710xxx  (20 mm).
doses were expressed in terms of the free base weights of each
compound.
3. results
3.1. stomach fundus
following crystal placement, 30 min proved sufficient to
establish a stable sonomicrometry recording of inter-crystal
distance. no spontaneous changes in stomach fundus muscle length were observed after this stabilization period, and
preparations remained viable for up to 2 h thereafter. following i.v. administration, the selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonist,
bw 723c86 (0.01–1 mg kg−1 ), but not its vehicle, produced a
dose-dependent reduction in fundus inter-crystal distance, consistent with longitudinal smooth muscle contraction (fig. 1a and
b). the mean ed50 value (with 95% confidence intervals) for
bw 723c86 (n = 7) was 65 (23–190) ␮g kg−1 and the mean
maximum response was 0.24 (0.15–0.32) mm (equivalent to a

j.l. mccullough et al. / pharmacological research 53 (2006) 353–358

maximum change from resting levels of 8.2 (4.3–12.1)%). the 5ht2b receptor agonist, ␣-methyl 5-ht (0.01–0.1 mg kg−1 i.v.),
also produced a dose-dependent reduction in fundus inter-crystal
distance (data not shown). the responses evoked by bw 723c86
and ␣-methyl 5-ht had a rapid onset (of typically <1 min after
dosing) and reached a maintained maximum response typically
within 2 min. responses evoked by ␣-methyl 5-ht were more
transient than those induced by bw 723c86, and more prone
to desensitization. in subsequent studies, bw 723c86 was used
routinely, rather than ␣-methyl 5-ht, as the former was considered likely to provide a more accurate representation of 5ht2b receptor agonist activity. pretreatment of rats with the
selective 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist, sb 206553 (1 mg kg−1
s.c., n = 10) attenuated the bw 723c86-mediated responses.
sb 206553 produced a rightward shift in the dose–response
curve to bw 723c86, with a reduction in the maximum agonist
response (fig. 1b). pretreatment with  xxxd2943xxx  (0.1 mg kg−1
s.c., n = 8), a selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist, was associated with only a small (i.e. approximately twofold) rightward
shift in the bw 723c86 dose response curve (fig. 1b). neither
 xxxd2943xxx  (0.1 mg kg−1 s.c.) nor sb 206553 (1 mg kg−1 s.c.)
had any effect on the resting inter-crystal distance per se.
intravenous administration of  xxxd3302xxx  (0.001–1 mg kg−1
i.v.) had no effect on the resting activity of the stomach fundus, with or without prior treatment with sb 206553 (1 mg kg−1
s.c.). similarly  xxxd3302xxx  (1 and 3 mg kg−1 s.c.) had no effect on
the resting activity of the fundus. however,  xxxd3302xxx  (1 and
3 mg kg−1 s.c., n = 10 for each), 5 min after  xxxd2943xxx  treat-

receptor interaction), inhibited the contractile response evoked
by bw 723c86 (0.01–1 mg kg−1 i.v.) in a dose-dependent manner.  xxxd3302xxx  produced a rightward shift in the bw 723c86
dose–response curve, with a reduction in the maximum agonist
response (fig. 2).

following crystal placement on the rat oesophagus,
30 min proved sufficient to establish a stable sonomicrometry recording. no spontaneous changes in oesophageal muscle length were observed after this stabilization period, and
preparations remained viable for up to 2 h. following i.v.
administration,  xxxd3302xxx  (0.001–0.3 mg kg−1 , n = 4),  xxxd1708xxx 
(0.03–3 mg kg−1 , n = 3) and mosapride (0.1–10 mg kg−1 , n = 5)
but not their vehicles (0.5 ml kg−1 ), evoked dose-dependent
increases in inter-crystal distance, consistent with relaxation
of the oesophagus (fig. 3a and b). the responses had a rapid
onset (typically 0.5–1 min after dosing) and reached a maintained maximum response within 2–3 min. the calculated mean
ed50 values (with 95% confidence limits) for  xxxd3302xxx ,  xxxd1708xxx  and mosapride were 11 (7–15) ␮g kg−1 , 142 (46–434) and
1824 (240–14,048) ␮g kg−1 , respectively. as a result of the low
potency of mosapride and solubility limitations, it was unclear
whether a maximum response to the compound was achieved.
it is considered that a combination of these issues, together perhaps, with an inherently high degree of inter-tissue variability,
contributed to the large confidence interval in the mosapride
potency determination. the mean maximum responses evoked
by  xxxd3302xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  were similar (0.19 (0.17–0.20) mm
and 0.18 (0.12–0.25) mm, respectively; equivalent to a maximum change from resting levels of 8.7 (8.0–9.4) and 8.3
(5.4–11.2)%, respectively). following s.c. dosing,  xxxd3302xxx 
(0.003–3 mg kg−1 ) increased the inter-crystal distance in a dosedependent manner (ed50 = 17.2 (9.7–30.4) ␮g kg−1 , maximum

reaching a plateau generally by 10–15 min) than those following i.v. dosing. pretreatment of rats with  xxxd2943xxx  (0.1 mg kg−1
s.c.) abolished the  xxxd3302xxx  (0.001–0.3 mg kg−1 i.v.)-mediated
oesophageal responses (fig. 4).  xxxd2943xxx  (0.1 mg kg−1 s.c.) had
no effect on resting inter-crystal distance per se.
4. discussion
 xxxd3302xxx  (zelnorm® ) was introduced recently for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and

chronic constipation, and is currently under clinical evaluation in diabetic gastroparesis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
and functional dyspepsia [7]. the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx 
is attributed to its  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity, although
it has affinity for other, non- xxxg1117xxx  receptors relevant to gastrointestinal function, such as the  xxxg1113xxx  family [11].
recently,  xxxd3302xxx  was shown to possess high  xxxg1114xxx 
binding affinity and potent 5-ht2b antagonist activity. localization of 5-ht2b receptors in the smooth muscle and myenteric
plexus of the gastrointestinal tract, and their role in augmenting
neuronally-mediated contraction of the human colon has been
demonstrated [4].
this study examined the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist and
 xxxg1117xxx  agonist activities of  xxxd3302xxx . as the rat isolated stomach fundus [16] and oesophagus [17] have been used widely
for assaying, respectively, 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistmediated changes in isometric tension, these tissues were
selected for this in vivo digital sonomicrometry investigation.
in addition to  xxxd3302xxx , the selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonists,
␣-methyl 5-ht and bw 723c86, and the selective  xxxg1117xxx  or
5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonists,  xxxd2943xxx  [25] or sb 206553,
respectively, were used as pharmacological tools to validate the
study findings. bw 723c86 and ␣-methyl 5-ht possess at least
80 or 10-fold higher affinity, respectively, for human and rat
5-ht2b receptors over the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c subtypes and
considerably greater selectivity over other non-5-ht2 receptors [26,27]. sb 206553 is a potent, mixed 5-ht2b/2c receptor
antagonist with at least 100-fold selectivity over 5-ht2a and
non-5-ht2 receptors [22].
the data from this study are consistent with the documented
role for 5-ht2b , but not  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity, in
contraction of the rat stomach fundus. thus, bw 723c86 and
␣-methyl 5-ht, but not  xxxd3302xxx , produced dose-dependent
reductions in inter-crystal distance indicative of smooth muscle contraction. with the oesophagus, following i.v. administration of  xxxd3302xxx , a dose-dependent increase in inter-crystal
distance was observed, consistent with  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistmediated relaxation of this preparation in vitro [28,29]. in
support of this conclusion, the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists,  xxxd1708xxx  and mosapride, also increased inter-crystal distance
and pretreatment with the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist,  xxxd2943xxx , inhibited the  xxxd3302xxx -induced responses. the
rank order of agonist potency following i.v. administration was
 xxxd3302xxx  >  xxxd1708xxx  > mosapride, consistent with their relative
potencies at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor [29,30].
this study provided further evidence that  xxxd3302xxx  is not
a selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist, but rather is a mixed
 xxxg1117xxx  agonist/5-ht2b antagonist. thus,  xxxd3302xxx  (1 and
3 mg kg−1 s.c.), in animals pretreated with  xxxd2943xxx , at
a dose (0.1 mg kg−1 s.c.) which abolished  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonist-mediated oesophageal responses, inhibited the contractile response evoked by bw 723c86 (0.01–1 mg kg−1 i.v.) in
the stomach fundus. sb 206553, a selective 5-ht2b/2c receptor
antagonist, also inhibited the bw 723c86-mediated responses.
rodent studies implicate activation of 5-ht2b receptors in
the development of the enteric nervous system [6]. it is evident
that mrna for the  xxxg1114xxx  is expressed throughout the

j.l. mccullough et al. / pharmacological research 53 (2006) 353–358

human and rodent gastrointestinal tract [4,6]. in humans, 5-ht2b
receptor protein is localized in circular and longitudinal muscle
layers, and in myenteric neurons of the colon [4]. furthermore,
 xxxg1114xxx  activation is associated with augmentation of
neurogenic contractions of human isolated colonic longitudinal
smooth muscle [4], consistent with intestinal prokinetic activity
in humans.
the observations that  xxxd3302xxx  has identical binding affinity
(ki = 4 nm) for the human 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor subtypes
[15], and that the maximum steady-state plasma concentration
is approximately 9 nm after oral administration of the approved
clinical dose in humans [31], suggest that 5-ht2b receptors are
occupied by  xxxd3302xxx  therapeutically. in this rodent study, the
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist potency of  xxxd3302xxx  exceeded its 5ht2b antagonist potency when administered via the same, s.c.,
route, despite the identical affinity of  xxxd3302xxx  at these subtypes [15]. this discrepancy may be a consequence of high
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx , a large  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
reserve in oesophageal tissue and/or differences in penetration
of  xxxd3302xxx  to the 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the stomach
and oesophagus, respectively. a disparity in tissue penetration
is unlikely; in isolated rat oesophagus and stomach fundus, there
was good agreement between the corresponding pec50 and pkb
values [15]. as the 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor functional potencies will be dependent clinically on the nature and degree of a
pathophysiological role for 5-ht at each receptor subtype, the
significance of the potency differential in the rat is unclear. the
relevance of the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx 
in the human gastrointestinal tract should become clear when
highly selective  xxxg1114xxx  antagonists or  xxxg1117xxx  agonists
have been evaluated therapeutically. such compounds are now
in clinical development and data are awaited with interest.
