with a binding affinity of 110% which is in the same order of
magnitude as levonorgestrel itself. the competition experiments suggest that  xxxd2753xxx  is a prodrug and that the melevonorgestrel
and
levonorgestrel-17tabolites,
acetate, which actively bind to the  xxxg1737xxx ,
must first be formed from the parent drug via metabolic processes in vivo. these are the actual biologically active compounds which are responsible for the gestagenic potency.

introduction

 xxxd2753xxx 

(d-(-)-13~-ethyl-17~-acetoxy-l7-ethinyl-4-gonen-

is a new orally active progestational compound
3-one-oxime)
(l-4). in the standard clauberg progestational assay, it is a
moderately potent progestin and it is active as an antiovulatory agent in rats, rabbits and hamsters. in contrast to other
synthetic progestins,  xxxd2753xxx  has an apparent endometrial
sparing action in the baboon and serves as a replacement for
progesterone in ovariectomized pregnant rats at doses lower
than those required with other progestins. up to now, it is an
open question whether  xxxd2753xxx  itself or certain metabolites of  xxxd2753xxx  may be responsible for stimulation at the
receptor level and the subsequent pharmacological response.
five urinary 17-a-ethinyl-metabolites have been characterized
by combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, following oral administration of "c- xxxd2753xxx  to women (5).
the metabolites include  xxxd2754xxx  as well as its reduced and
hydroxylated transformation products. however, intact  xxxd2753xxx  was not detected. more recently, small amounts of  xxxd2753xxx  and large amounts of 17-deacetylated  xxxd2753xxx 
(levonorgestrel-3-oxime) were measured in blood after oral
administration of  xxxd2753xxx  in combination with  xxxd2054xxx  to women (6). no evidence for the presence of deoximated  xxxd2753xxx  (levonorgestrel-17-acetate) was given.
