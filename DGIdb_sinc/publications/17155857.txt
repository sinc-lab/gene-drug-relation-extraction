phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4) is an important camp-metabolising enzyme in
immune and inflammatory cells, airway smooth muscle and pulmonary
nerves. the  xxxg1697xxx  (pde4) enzyme plays a significant role in
modulating the activity of camp, an important second messenger that
mediates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle and suppresses inflammatory cell function, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response. selective inhibitors of this enzyme show a broad spectrum of activity in animal
models of copd and asthma. these drugs block the hydrolysis of camp via
inhibition of pde4 and are attractive candidates for novel anti-inflammatory
drugs. at present, two second-generation pde4 inhibitors for the treatment
of copd and asthma patients are being tested in clinical phase iii trials. the
most advanced compound is the orally active, selective pde4 inhibitor
 xxxd1697xxx  ( xxxd1697xxx ™,  xxxd1697xxx , cis-4-cyano-4-[3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; glaxosmithkline).  xxxd1697xxx  shows high
selectivity for camp-specific pde4, an isoenzyme that predominates in
pro-inflammatory and immune cells and that is 10-fold more selective for
 xxxg1700xxx  than for  xxxg1697xxx , -b or -c. in vitro,  xxxd1697xxx  suppresses the activity of
several pro-inflammatory and immune cells that have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of asthma and copd. moreover, it is highly active in animal
models of these diseases.  xxxd1697xxx  has been shown to exert potent
anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. it is orally active and may
be effective in the treatment of asthma and copd; however, complete assessment of the therapeutic value of this novel compound class must await the
outcome of longer-term clinical trials. this review presents a summary of the
preclinical and clinical profile of  xxxd1697xxx  in patients with copd.

1. introduction

inhibition of phosphodiesterase (pde) activity has been widely used in the treatment of respiratory diseases that are associated with inflammatory processes, such
as asthma and copd via the application of theophylline [1]; however, because theophylline may lead to serious adverse effects, its dose must be carefully titrated in
the patient and plasma concentration routinely monitored [2]. there are
∼ 10 – 15% of patients receiving theophylline who experience gastrointestinal
upset, insomnia and other minor side effects [3]. potentially life-threatening
cardiovascular and cns complications (such as arrhythmias and convulsions) can

 xxxd1697xxx 

occur when theophylline plasma levels rise to > 20 µg/ml [2].
clinical use of theophylline is further complicated by potential drug interactions via the cyp1a2 enzyme, which is
inhibited by many drugs and compounds, including beta2-agonists, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, digoxin, warfarin and
tobacco smoke [2]. due to its narrow tolerability margin, the
current global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (gold) guidelines on the management of copd have
recommended the use of theophylline as restricted to
individuals with a poorly controlled disease [4,5,201].
however, pde isoenzymes remain an attractive therapeutic
target as they are differentially expressed in various cells and
tissues, mediating several distinct functions. in particular,
attention has focused on pde4 subtype activity. the selective
inhibition of pde4 confers an anti-inflammatory effect that
may be clinically relevant in patients with inflammatory diseases such as asthma or copd [4,6-10]. in fact, it has been suggested that pde4 inhibitors may be superior to
corticosteroids in clinical use because they not only induce
anti-inflammatory effects but also influence a number of
other cell types implicated in obstructive lung diseases,
including respiratory epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and
submucosal glands [111-13].
together with the identification and molecular cloning of
several gene families of pdes, these findings have sparked the
clinical development of a number of pde-specific
inhibitors [14,15] including awd-12281, ic-485, ono-6126,
arofylline, grc-3886, tetomilast,  xxxd1697xxx  ( xxxd1697xxx ™,
 xxxd1697xxx ,
cis-4-cyano-4-[3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; glaxosmithkline) and
 xxxd3140xxx . all of these compounds are being tested in clinical
trials. at present, the most advanced pde4 inhibitors are
 xxxd3140xxx  and  xxxd1697xxx , which are in late phase iii trials for
asthma and/or copd [9,16-18]. altana pharma has withdrawn its eu marketing authorisation application for  xxxd3140xxx  ( xxxd3140xxx ®) in november 2005 although submission of a
new marketing authorisation application will be pursued after
further clinical data are available [202]. this review focuses on
the therapeutic potential that the novel pde4 inhibitor  xxxd1697xxx  offers as an immunomodulatory and bronchodilatory
agent in the treatment of copd.

the pde4 gene family consists of four major genes (a, b,
c and d) that are spliced by alternative mrna processing,
resulting in a variety of pde4 isoforms (labelled 1 – 9) [19,22].
the pde4 gene products are differentially expressed in various tissues and cell types (table 1). although pde4 inhibitors
that are known to date do not discriminate between products
derived from the 4 pde4 genes [25], the bronchodilator role
attributed to pde4 ablation in the mouse is preferentially
mediated via  xxxg1700xxx , whereas the anti-inflammatory role in
this species (and possibly in humans) is mediated via engagement of  xxxg1698xxx  [26,27] and possibly  xxxg1697xxx  [28], as is the case
for  xxxd1697xxx  [29].  xxxd1697xxx  is a potent (inhibitory rate constant [ki] = 92 nm), isoenzyme-selective pde4 inhibitor and
is essentially inactive against pde1, -2, -3, -5 and -7 [29]. the
potency of  xxxd1697xxx  against pde4 is comparable with that of
 xxxd3142xxx  (ki = 26 nm).  xxxd1697xxx  is ∼ 7-fold more selective
for  xxxg1700xxx  (median inhibitory constant [ic50] = 12 nm)
than for  xxxg1697xxx  (ic50 = 115 nm), -b (ic50 = 86 nm) or -c
(ic50 = 308 nm) [30].
native pde4 isoforms can adopt two active conformational states (or conformers) [31], which can be distinguished pharmacologically by their relative sensitivity towards
 xxxd3142xxx . the affinity is determined via the binding of
divalent metal ions (mn2+ and mg2+) located at the bottom of
its active site [32]. the two distinct conformers are termed
hpde4 and lpde4, respectively [7,33]; one conformational
state interacts with  xxxd3142xxx  with high affinity in the
nanomolar range (high-affinity pde4; hpde4), whereas the
other exhibits a much lower affinity in the micromolar range
(low-affinity pde4; lpde4) [33]. generally, inhibition of
hpde4 is correlated with certain adverse events (such as
emesis and gastric acid secretion), whereas potential therapeutic effects are related to lpde4 interaction in inflammatory processes [21,31,34,35].  xxxd1697xxx  was among the first of
a new generation of pde4 inhibitors, which was specifically
designed to: primarily have equivalent potency to (r)- xxxd3142xxx  (ki = 100 nm) for inhibition of lpde4, the conformer
of pde4 that predominates in selected inflammatory cells
and, second, to have a reduced potency as an inhibitor of
hpde4 [36,37].
3. classification

2. pde4

pdes are critically involved in the modulation of signal
transduction and act via the degradation of cyclic nucleotides
(camp and/or cgmp). the pde isoenzymes  xxxg1695xxx , -4, -7
and -8 show specificity for camp [19,20]. pde4 camp pdes
are members of the pde superfamily of enzymes, which is
composed of ≥ 11 members that hydrolyse camp and/or
cgmp [19,20]. pde4 is the main camp-metabolising enzyme
that is expressed in many inflammatory cells and its
inhibition attenuates the production of various inflammatory
cell functions.

110

of pde4 inhibitors

camp phosphodiesterases
based on their structural characteristics, pde4 inhibitors can
be divided into at least four distinct structural classes [12,38,39]:
• the  xxxd3142xxx -type pde4 inhibitor [40];
• the nitraquazone-type pde4 inhibitor [41];
• the xanthine nucleus-type inhibitor (either containing or
resembling a xanthine nucleus [42], including
denbufylline); and
• other
pde4
inhibitors
(including
1-aryl-2,3bis[hydroxy-methyl] naphthalene ligands and indazole
derivatives) [30].

4. molecular

structure of  xxxd1697xxx 

 xxxd1697xxx  is structurally related to  xxxd3142xxx  [37]. the structure of  xxxd1697xxx  contains three pharmacophores (figure 1): a
carboxylic acid moiety; a nitrile moiety; and a
3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl moiety.
studies have suggested that the 3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl moiety, together with an appropriately positioned
h-bond acceptor, is the minimum pharmacophore required
for pde inhibition [37]. to decrease conformational flexibility,
avoid chirality and maintain the spatial relationships between
the pharmacophore units, a 1,4-substituted cyclohexane ring
was used to position the carboxylic acid, nitrile and
3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl moieties relative to each
other [37].
5. pharmacokinetics

and metabolism

 xxxd1697xxx  demonstrates a markedly improved side-effect
profile over the archetypal pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx , which
has been attributed to its inability to discriminate between
the high-affinity  xxxd3142xxx  (hpde4) binding site and the
enzymatic catalytic domain. in addition, factors (such as its
negative charge at physiological ph) limit its access to certain
tissues such as the cns or gastric glands. furthermore,
 xxxg1700xxx  subtype selectivity may also play an important
role [30,43], although it has been suggested that pde4 selectivity possibly contributes to the poor therapeutic ratio of
 xxxd1697xxx  [44].
in humans,  xxxd1697xxx  is rapidly and completely absorbed
after oral administration, providing a dose-proportional systemic exposure with doses of ≤ 4 mg. it is completely bioavailable, has a terminal elimination half-life of ∼ 6.5 h and
is subject to negligible first-pass hepatic metabolism [30]. in
addition, it exhibits low intersubject variability.  xxxd1697xxx 
is predominantly protein bound (99.4%) but this binding is
concentration independent at clinically relevant doses, with
a small volume of distribution at steady state (17 l). plasma
clearance (∼ 2 l/h) is almost entirely metabolic, through
multiple parallel pathways.  xxxd1697xxx  is extensively metabolised, with decyclopentylation, acyl glucuronidation and
3-hydroxylation of the cyclopentyl ring representing the
principal routes. the most abundant metabolite, formed by
the action of  xxxg586xxx , has < 10% of the activity of the

parent molecule [43]. most of the drug is excreted in the
urine (∼ 90%) and faeces (6 – 7%), with non-metabolised
 xxxd1697xxx  accounting for < 1% of the administered dose.
total plasma  xxxd1697xxx  pharmacokinetic parameters did not
change significantly with renal or hepatic impairment but
concentrations of unbound  xxxd1697xxx  increased with
declining renal or hepatic function. a dose of 15 mg b.i.d.
has been found to be clinically effective. smoking and age
have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd1697xxx .
5.1 drug

interaction
 xxxd1697xxx  has been shown to have no clinically relevant interactions with a range of drugs that are likely to be coadministered to patients with copd, with the exception of
erythromycin. in this case, concurrent administration with
 xxxd1697xxx  was associated with an increased incidence of
gastrointestinal adverse events [43].
5.2 mode

of action
based on their ability to suppress the activation of a variety of
inflammatory cells, pde4 inhibitors are considered to be
promising anti-inflammatory drugs [45,46]; however, the
detailed mechanism of pde4 inhibitors involved in
anti-inflammatory activities is not fully understood as yet.
the ability of the compounds to inhibit pde4 catalytic activity (which correlates with the anti-inflammatory potency of
these agents) has now been known for several years [35,47].
pde4 selectively catalyses the hydrolysis of camp [36], and
the anti-inflammatory effects of selective pde4 inhibitors are
believed to be mediated via the reduction of camp hydrolysis
(figure 2). camp is a second messenger and raised camp levels exert inhibitory effects on many inflammatory cells via
activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) [48,49]. camp/pka also
induce smooth muscle relaxation and modulate neural
transmission in animal models [48].
pde4 inhibitors are also known to interfere with cellular
signalling via a camp- and pka-independent mechanism,
leading to activation of transcription factors, consequently
blocking leukocyte activation and cytokine synthesis [50,51];
for example,  xxxd3140xxx  inhibits the production of several
inflammatory mediators, such as no, tnf-alpha and il-1 in a
murine macrophage cell line (raw264.7) via inhibition of
 xxxg1559xxx  activation, phosphorylation of  xxxg1372xxx /jnk and p38

inhibitors was further confirmed by in vivo data showing that
 xxxd3140xxx  also reduces plasma levels of lps-triggered no,
tnf-alpha and il-1, which is associated with an increased survival rate from septic shock. other studies have shown that
pde4 inhibitors decrease fmlp-induced oxygen radical
release in bronchoalveolar lavage cells enriched in neutrophils
through direct  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk activation by a camp- and
pka-independent mechanism [49].

potential of  xxxd1697xxx 

a significant effort has been made to delineate the
anti-inflammatory properties of pde4 inhibitors on immune
cell and structural airway cell function (figure 3). the
first-generation selective pde4 inhibitor,  xxxd3142xxx , decreases
the influx of inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation
induced by various stimuli [21,45,53,54]. exposure of rat eosinophils to  xxxd3142xxx  reduces eosinophil migration evoked by
either  xxxd2973xxx  or leukotriene b4 in vitro [55].
it has also been demonstrated that salbutamol itself does not
modify eosinophil migration induced by either  xxxd2973xxx  or  xxxg354xxx  in vitro, but clearly improves the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3142xxx . this suggests an involvement of
the camp pathway in eosinophil chemotaxis [56].  xxxd3142xxx 
also inhibits neutrophil infiltration by 63% in a guinea-pig
model of lps-induced lung neutrophilia [57], decreases
lps-induced lung neutrophilia in mice by 75% [58] and abolishes neutrophil influx induced by antigen challenge in brown
norway rats [59].
 xxxd1697xxx  has been shown to exhibit similar effects.
in vitro,  xxxd1697xxx  suppresses the activity of many pro-inflammatory and immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of
copd and is highly active in animal models [60-62]; for example,  xxxd1697xxx  inhibits neutrophil degranulation (including
the release of  xxxg694xxx , matrylisin and
myeloperoxidase), whereas the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor milrinone and

the nonselective pde inhibitor theophylline showed no
effect [63]. in addition, the drug also reduced neutrophil
adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells [54]. moreover,  xxxd1697xxx  inhibits antigen-driven  xxxg1180xxx  production,
cytokine-induced adhesion to endothelial cells and chemotaxis [48,62]. in addition,  xxxd1697xxx  blocks the release of
tnf-alpha by lps-stimulated murine mononuclear cells, human
monocytes or whole blood obtained from healthy individuals
in vitro [36,65]. furthermore,  xxxd1697xxx  decreases lps-stimulated tnf-alpha production in whole blood from patients with
copd [66]. it also inhibits the release of tnf-alpha and
gm-csf by bronchial epithelial and sputum cells isolated
from patients with copd. furthermore, it significantly
reduced the chemotactic activity of supernatant fluids harvested from cultured bronchial epithelial and sputum cells of
copd patients [18].
comparison of the selective pde4 inhibitor  xxxd1697xxx  and
the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on cigarette smoke- and
lps-induced airway neutrophilia [17] revealed another interesting action. as expected, both  xxxd1697xxx  and dexamethasone were able to dose-dependently block lps-induced
neutrophilia; however, neutrophilia induced by cigarette
smoke was inhibited by  xxxd1697xxx , whereas dexamethasone
treatment failed to affect neutrophil infiltration [66]. this
effect of  xxxd1697xxx  may be of potential clinical relevance in
patients suffering from copd.

in addition to the suppression of inflammatory cell function,  xxxd1697xxx  may also affect the tissue-remodelling process
in copd. mmps play an important role in the proteolytic
degradation of the extracellular matrix, both in physiological
processes and during pathological events [67]. the most
accepted theory for the pathogenesis of copd (which
includes emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis) involves
deteriorated lung homeostasis. this abnormal remodelling
causes a net increase in deposited extracellular matrix and
collagen content in the lungs, resulting from mmps/timps
imbalance [68]. the process is accompanied by a striking
fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation and activation, which
increases the production of matrix-degrading enzymes [69].
furthermore, local overexpression of cytokines and/or
growth factor stimulates resident lung fibroblasts to synthesise increased amounts of collagen, as well as of various
mmps such as collagenase-1 ( xxxg1418xxx ), and gelatinases a
and -b ( xxxg1428xxx  and -9, respectively) [70].
 xxxd1697xxx  has also been shown to inhibit fibroblast
chemotaxis and function; for example,  xxxd1697xxx  significantly

attenuates the tnf-alpha-induced release of both  xxxg1418xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  from human fetal lung fibroblasts (hfl-1) [71].
fibroblasts cultured with pma or tnf-alpha released increased
amounts of pro- xxxg1418xxx , whereas  xxxg2269xxx  had no effect [72].
incubation of fibroblasts with  xxxd1697xxx  inhibited the
tnf-alpha-induced increase in pro- xxxg1418xxx . these results demonstrate that this pde4 inhibitor is effective in inhibiting the
pro- xxxg1418xxx  and -2 secretion induced by tnf-alpha, suggesting
a potential therapeutic benefit of  xxxd1697xxx  in lung diseases
associated with tissue remodelling [72].
there is another interesting aspect of pde4 inhibition that
should be noted. the selective pde4 inhibitor ci-1044, at a
dose of 30 mg/kg/day p.o., significantly inhibited the development of emphysema by 89% at 24 weeks following cigarette smoke exposure in mice [73]. these data support the use
of pde4 inhibitors as a novel copd therapy. however,
although it is likely that other pde4 inhibitors show similar
action, this effect has yet to be demonstrated for  xxxd1697xxx .
in 2003, the anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd1697xxx  that
were observed in preclinical studies were confirmed in a

small, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 59 patients
with copd [74]. after 12 weeks of  xxxd1697xxx  therapy,
bronchial biopsies taken from treated patients indicated that
 xxxd1697xxx  significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory
markers (i.e., cd8+ t lymphocytes and cd68+
macrophages) [74].

 xxxd1697xxx  has demonstrated efficacy in some clinical trials
with respect to lung function, number of exacerbations and
quality of life (qol).
function
in a randomised phase ii study involving 424 patients with
moderate disease,  xxxd1697xxx  produced significant improvements relative to the placebo with regard to the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1), forced vital capacity (fvc) and
peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) [9,75]. improvements in exertional dyspnoea, rescue bronchodilator use, and resting arterial oxygen saturation and sao2 were also noted [9,76]. the
improvement in lung function and health status of subjects
with copd who were administered  xxxd1697xxx  were confirmed in additional 6-month multi-centre phase iii studies
that involved larger cohorts of patients. in three of these
investigations, statistically significant enhancements in fev1,
fvc, and trough fev1 were demonstrated. other lung function parameters, including trough forced expiratory flow
between 25 and 75% of the fvc (fef25–75) and trough
fev6, showed improved values by  xxxd1697xxx , suggesting that
a clinically important effect of the drug may have occurred in
the small airways [23].
the potential for  xxxd1697xxx  to promote bronchodilatation
was also assessed in patients with copd. fev1 was measured
in patients before and at ≤ 8-h intervals after receiving placebo
or a single dose of  xxxd1697xxx , or  xxxd1697xxx  in combination
with inhaled salbutamol (400 µg) and/or ipratropium
bromide (80 µg). however, in contrast to the inhaled
bronchodilators,  xxxd1697xxx  did not cause acute bronchodilation in patients with copd [77]. the mean maximum
increase in fev1 was 140 ml following oral administration of
 xxxd1697xxx  and 152 ml following placebo compared with salbutamol (280 ml) or ipratropium (297 ml). interestingly, the
combined treatment of  xxxd1697xxx  with both salbutamol and
ipratropium (p < 0.01) resulted in an enhanced increase in
fev1 amounting to 379 ml [77].

and pefr versus baseline [10]. interestingly, the improvements
in lung function observed with  xxxd1697xxx  are independent of
smoking status [70], which further emphasises the potential
therapeutic role of pde4 inhibition in copd.
in a randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled
clinical trial with  xxxd3140xxx  in patients with
moderate-to-severe copd over a 26-week period,
treatment was associated not only with a positive effect on
lung function but also on the frequency of exacerbations.
 xxxd3140xxx  decreased the number of exacerbations by 48%
relative to the placebo, although this effect did not reach
statistical significance [10]. a similar trend was observed in a
dose-ranging study with  xxxd1697xxx , although exacerbations
were not an outcome parameter [9].

7.1 lung

7.2 exacerbations

 xxxd1697xxx  significantly reduces the risk of exacerbations that
require treatment by a physician or hospitalisation [15,23] and
provided sustained improvement in lung function over
6 months in patients with mild-to-moderate disease [78,79].
these data are comparable with the efficacy of  xxxd3140xxx  in
patients with copd, with significant improvements in fev1
114

7.3 quality

of life
qol was assessed using the st george’s respiratory questionnaire (sgrq) and the medical outcomes study 36-item
short-form health survey (sf-36), and this was recorded
before and after therapy with  xxxd1697xxx  or placebo. the
results of the two questionnaires demonstrated a consistent
improvement in qol approaching what is considered to be
clinically relevant [9,15,23].
8. side-effect

profile of  xxxd1697xxx 

theophylline is associated with serious cardiovascular and
cns side effects, even at therapeutic doses [2]. these effects
are generally attributed to nonselective inhibition of pdes
(see above) as well as concomitant adenosine receptor antagonism, and include tachycardia, serious arrhythmias, focal and
generalised seizures, and coma [4]. when the first generation
of pde4 inhibitors were developed, it was hypothesised that
these compounds would present fewer side effects than theophylline due to their selectivity for pde4; however, these
agents are associated with a number of adverse events (including nausea, vomiting and gastric acid secretion) that limit
their clinical use [80].
in contrast, second-generation pde4 inhibitors have an
improved therapeutic ratio. thus, a major benefit of
 xxxd1697xxx  and  xxxd3140xxx  is its superior safety and tolerability
profile versus theophylline and the first-generation pde4
inhibitors. indeed,  xxxd1697xxx  has proven safe and well
tolerated at doses of ≤ 15 mg b.i.d. in both short- and
long-term dosing trials, with a moderate incidence of adverse
events [9,15,23]. the most common adverse experience was
nausea, which developed within a few days of starting treatment and was generally mild or moderate and self limiting. in
contrast, vomiting was rare. in addition, there was no pattern
or trend for any other serious adverse effect that was
associated with  xxxd1697xxx . nevertheless, at doses of > 20 mg
b.i.d., the frequency and severity of adverse effects significantly increased the emetic side effects of pde4 inhibitors
and the drug was not well tolerated [81]. thus, it appears that
cns side effects are still closely associated with selective

pde4 inhibition. a possible explanation has been offered by a
2005 study showing that inhibition of  xxxg1700xxx  in the brain is
responsible for the emetic response [60]; therefore, this adverse
effect is difficult to control even with the specific inhibitors
that are currently available. thus, it remains to be seen
whether or not these pde4 inhibitors will be able to
overcome the emetic side effects of earlier compounds.
in laboratory animals (non-human primates, rats and
mice), the inhibition of pde4 by  xxxd1697xxx  and other inhibitors is associated with vasculitis in multiple organs and
mesenteric vessels at doses of 30 – 200 mg/kg/day [82-84]. as
the development of vasculitis has not been observed in
humans, this may represent a species-specific adverse effect.
the reason for this adverse effect is unclear. it is possible that
certain species are relatively more sensitive to pde4
inhibitor-induced toxicity because tissue expression levels of
mrnas encoding  xxxg1697xxx , -b, -c and -d are significantly
higher in the animals than in humans [85]; however, it
remains unclear whether pde4 inhibition-associated
vasculitis has any relationship to the gastrointestinal adverse
effects reported in humans (abdominal pain, diarrhoea,
nausea and vomiting).
9. clinical

development

the clinical programme developed for  xxxd1697xxx  in copd
has included a total of 4093 patients in both phase ii and
iii trials to date. evidence of safety and efficacy has been
based on 4 pivotal trials involving 2883 patients. in addition, 2 phase iii open-label extension studies (n = 1069)
followed patients treated with  xxxd1697xxx  for 3 years. the
primary end points were fev1 and total score on the
sgrq survey [30].
9.1 phase

i trials
 xxxd1697xxx  was well tolerated at doses of < 15 mg (2, 4, 7, 10,
15 or 20 mg p.o.) administered twice daily in a 9-day study
involving 42 healthy male volunteers [81,86]. no drug-related
effects were observed in haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or cardiovascular tests (i.e., ecg and blood pressure);
however, nausea and vomiting was frequently observed at
doses of 15 mg b.i.d.
9.2 phase

ii trials
phase ii trails were performed both in asthma and copd.
9.2.1 asthma

in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial involving
27 patients with allergic asthma, patients received  xxxd1697xxx 
10 mg b.i.d. for 7 days. exercise-induced airways obstruction
was assessed on days 1 and 7. the results show that  xxxd1697xxx 
reduced the mean fall in fev1 by > 10% (23.6 versus 32.9%)
compared with placebo [87], suggesting a protective effect of
the drug against exercise-induced airways obstruction. no
treatment-related adverse effects were observed with 10 mg

b.i.d. but nausea and vomiting occurred at the twice-daily
doses of 15 and 20 mg [87]. in another phase ii study in
303 asthma patients after a 6-week treatment with  xxxd1697xxx 
5, 10 or 15 mg b.i.d., the fev1 increased by nearly 300 and
200 ml from baseline at the highest and lowest dose,
respectively, whereas the placebo caused an increase of
100 ml [30].
9.2.2 copd

two phase ii clinical trials, conducted in out-patients with
moderate copd, evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of orally administered  xxxd1697xxx  [202]. in 1 of the studies
(study number 032), 424 patients with moderate copd
(fev1 = 46.8% of predicted, fev1/fvc = 54.6% and
post-salbutamol reversibility = 5.4%) received  xxxd1697xxx  twice
daily (5 mg b.i.d., n = 109; 10 mg b.i.d., n = 102; or 15 mg
b.i.d., n = 107) over a period of 6 weeks [9,203]. at the highest
dose,  xxxd1697xxx  showed a significant antiobstructive effect
with an increase in mean fev1 compared with placebo at
week 6 (130 versus -30 ml; p < 0.0001). this translates to a
difference between the  xxxd1697xxx  and placebo groups of
160 ml, which represented an 11% improvement in lung
function when compared with subjects who received
placebo [9,203]. the fvc and pefr, exertional dyspnoea, rescue bronchodilator use, and resting and post-exercise sao2
also improved significantly.
it should be emphasised that  xxxd1697xxx  < 15 mg b.i.d. only
produced a marginal improvement in lung function, which
was confirmed in a similar multi-centred phase ii study
(number 038) [203]. in this study, patients with moderate
copd (n = 224) received  xxxd1697xxx  2.5 or 5.0 mg b.i.d. over
a period of 4 weeks in a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. an increase in pre-bronchodilator fev1
from baseline could be observed in each treatment group. the
greatest improvement over placebo in fev1 was observed
with the 5-mg dose 1 h after the first dose. in addition, a
trend towards a reduction dyspnoea (according to the borg
scale after a 6-min walking test) and towards a reduction in
the number of exacerbations was observed; however, there
were no significant changes in pre- or post-bronchodilator
fev1 levels in any of the treatment groups compared with
baseline or when the active treatment group was compared
with the placebo controls [88]. thus, a twice-daily dose of
15 mg appears to be the minimal effective dose required to
produce clinically meaningful effects.
in addition to lung function, the qol was assessed using
the sf-36 and sgrq surveys before and after therapy with
 xxxd1697xxx  or placebo [9]. consistent improvements were
observed for those subjects receiving  xxxd1697xxx  15 mg b.i.d.
when compared with the placebo group, although no
statistical significance was achieved [9,89].
the drug was generally well tolerated. the most common
adverse effects were nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain;
however, there was no significant difference in serious adverse
events between the active treatment group and placebo [9,75].

improvements in health status (assessed with the
[79,107]

function (fev1) were observed in patients receiving
 xxxd1697xxx  for 6 months. in addition, use of healthcare
resources (i.e., physician visits, emergency department
visits and hospitalisation) was lower in  xxxd1697xxx -treated
patients and exacerbation of copd was significantly
reduced.
a total of two of the studies reached clinical significance
but two did not. in the two positive trials, there was a
mean change in fev1 from baseline of 10 ml for  xxxd1697xxx 
compared with 20- and 30-ml reductions, respectively,
for placebo

fev1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s.

another investigation on 59 patients with copd receiving  xxxd1697xxx  15 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks assessed
the effect of  xxxd1697xxx  on bronchial inflammation. treatment with  xxxd1697xxx  led to a transient rise of fev1 (40 ml)
at week 8, but was not different at the end of the study. a net
difference of 70 ml between the  xxxd1697xxx  and placebo
groups was observed. this value is comparable to an increase
of 160 ml observed in the study by compton and colleagues
in patients with a similar level of pre-study obstruction [9].
treatment did not alter the relative numbers of sputum
neutrophils, macrophages, total cell counts, nor change the
concentrations of il-8 and  xxxg694xxx . in addition,
no significant treatment-related effects were seen in the numbers of subepithelial neutrophils, il-8 mrna+ or tnf-alpha
mrna+ cells. however, immunostaining of bronchial biopsies of the central airways obtained at baseline and at week 10
demonstrated that  xxxd1697xxx  treatment was associated with a
decline in cd8+ t lymphocytes (p = 0.001) and cd68+
macrophages (p < 0.05) compared with placebo, both of
which are increased in copd and correlate with disease
severity [9,74,76]. in addition, a post hoc analysis revealed a
decrease in subepithelial cd4+ t lymphocytes (42%;
p = 0.025) and neutrophils (37%; p = 0.049). this is the
first significant finding demonstrating a reduction of airway
tissue inflammatory cells characteristic of copd by any
agent (table 2).

9.3 phase

iii trials
the improvement in lung function and health status in the
phase ii trials prompted glaxosmithkline to commit itself to
a comprehensive phase iii development programme for a
period of 6 months evaluating efficacy, cardiovascular safety
and mechanism of action. in these studies,  xxxd1697xxx  was
given at the maximum-tolerated dose (15 mg b.i.d.), which
was the only dose in all of the phase ii studies that was found
to produce improvements in lung function, symptoms and
qol that were superior to placebo [9,203,204].
a total of 4 pivotal studies of  xxxd1697xxx  in a total of
2883 patients (study number 039, n = 647; study 042,
n = 700; study 091, n = 711; and 156, n = 825) comparing
 xxxd1697xxx  15 mg b.i.d. with placebo over 24 weeks were performed [30,90]. in the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre investigation
(study 039), involving 647 patients with stable copd
(n = 431) receiving  xxxd1697xxx  15 mg b.i.d. (216 patients
receiving placebo) over 24 weeks, the pde4 inhibitor caused
an improved health status (as assessed using the sgrq survey) [91]. this set of patients demonstrated improved lung
function with a mean increase from baseline in fev1 of 10 ml
compared with a decrease of 30 ml in the placebo group
(difference: 40 ml; p = 0.002; table 3). in addition, a significantly greater percentage of subjects in the  xxxd1697xxx  group
were exacerbation free at 24 weeks ( xxxd1697xxx : 74%;

placebo: 62%). moreover, a reduced use of healthcare
resources (physician visits, emergency department visits and
hospitalisation) was observed [9,78,92]. serial measurements of
disease-specific health status (i.e., total score of the sgrq
survey) showed a significant improvement in subjects who
had been treated with  xxxd1697xxx  (study 039), although the
effect was only modest (table 4).
gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea and
abdominal pain) were generally mild or moderate and predominantly occurred within the first 3 weeks of treatment but
occasionally interfered with daily activities ( xxxd1697xxx : 17%;
placebo: 8%)
the results of the other 3 studies (studies 042, 091 and
156) were less convincing. the same end-point measures were
made as those described for trial number 039. after a 4-week,
single-blind, run-in phase, a total number of 2236 patients
(1361 receiving  xxxd1697xxx  and 875 placebo controls) with stable copd were treated with  xxxd1697xxx  15 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 24 weeks (table 4). in all of the trials, fev1 was
maintained or improved (0 – +30 ml) in patients receiving
 xxxd1697xxx  versus placebo and the mean difference between
treatments in fev1 as change from baseline did not reach statistical significance in study numbers 042 and 091. a clinically significant reduction (26%) in the risk of
moderate-to-severe copd exacerbations (exacerbation-free
rates) with  xxxd1697xxx  compared with placebo was found only
in study 091 [75,93]. similarly, a statistically significant
improvement in qol associated with  xxxd1697xxx  relative to
placebo could be demonstrated only in study 156.
10. discussion

the concept of pde4 inhibition as a principle method of
treatment for obstructive airways disease and other inflammatory airway conditions is an attractive approach. indeed,
several preclinical and clinical data support the use of pde4
inhibitors (such as  xxxd1697xxx ) in treating copd.  xxxd1697xxx  is
orally active and has been shown to exert a consistent
anti-inflammatory effect in several preclinical studies. in the
only human study reported to date,  xxxd1697xxx  treatment
reduced the density of cd8+ t lymphocytes and cd68+ cells
in the airway mucosa in patients with copd [64]. in addition,
the drug is well tolerated [9,92], reduces the incidence of copd
exacerbations and appears to improve health status [79].
however, despite the anti-inflammatory action, a bronchodilatory effect of  xxxd1697xxx  appears to be weak and could not
be consistently demonstrated. a total of 2 of the 4 pivotal
studies (studies 039 and 156) that reached clinical significance, whereas 2 (studies 042 and 091) did not. indeed, in
the two studies that did reach significance, this was largely
due to a decrease in fev1 in the placebo group rather than an
increase in those receiving  xxxd1697xxx .
the poor performance of  xxxd1697xxx  in these efficacy
studies is difficult to explain given the considerable
improvement in fev1 obtained in trial 032, which showed

an improvement of trough fev1 at week 6 for  xxxd1697xxx 
between 130 ml (relative to baseline) and 160 ml (relative to
placebo). the level of improvement demonstrated in the
phase iii trials (maximal increase in fev1 of 3% from mean
baseline value) is less than that achieved by oral
theophylline in subjects with stable copd (∼ 100 ml) [94].
this is also significantly less than the reversibility achieved by
inhaled salbutamol (6.5 – 6.7%) and several other
pulmonary drugs [202]. although the reasons for this
discrepancy remain to be determined, the aspects
discussed in sections 10.1 – 10.3 may provide some
potential explanations.
10.1 discrepancy

between phase ii and iii trials
a possible explanation could be that the highest tolerated
dose of  xxxd1697xxx  (i.e., 15 mg b.i.d.) falls on the leading edge
of the dose–response curve and that it is the low therapeutic
ratio of this compound that prevents efficacy from being realised. another factor that could account for the difference
includes the large degree of variability in the  xxxd1697xxx  plasma
trough concentrations, where the coefficient of variation
exceeded 60% and the fact that the data are highly
unbalanced [90].
another potentially relevant aspect relates to the question
of whether fev1 is indeed the most appropriate parameter for
measuring drug effects in copd; for example, it has been
suggested that the forced inspiratory volume in 1 s may better
reflect lung function in copd in terms of reproducibility of
bronchodilator responses, particularly in severe disease [95] as
it excludes the effect of small airways collapse during
expiration in these patients. thus, the varying severity of
copd in patients enrolled (e.g., the proportion of patients
with or without emphysema in phase ii and iii studies) may
have also affected the data.
the systemic distribution of the drug may also provide an
additional explanation. oral administration enables the drug
to reach the most distal airways (bronchioli), which are often
not fully reached by drug inhalation. addressing the bronchioli
may be important as small airways play a significant role in the
pathophysiology in copd. indeed, the phase iii trial
(study 039) shows an improved fef25–75 and trough fev6 by
 xxxd1697xxx , suggesting that a clinically important impact of the
drug may have occurred in the small airways [90,91].
10.2 deterioration

in trough fev1
a second relevant question that deserves consideration refers
to the rapid deterioration in trough fev1 within few weeks
in three of the four phase iii studies in subjects receiving
placebo. this also contrasts to the data obtained in the
phase ii trial (study 032), and other long-term clinical trials
of copd, where no meaningful change in fev1 relative to
baseline was observed [94,96]. the reasons may partially relate
to two important factors. first, it may be possible that the
data are distorted due to subject withdrawal (e.g., only 76%
or 164 subjects completed the double-blind phase in

trial 039). second, in contrast to phase ii trials, subjects
with copd were only enrolled if they were poorly reversible
to inhaled salbutamol at baseline (increase in fev1 < 8.6%
from baseline). it is possible that this criterion was introduced to detect improvements in lung function that are
unrelated to bronchodilation; however, the study design did
not take into account the impact of regression towards the
mean [97,98]. it has been suggested that bronchodilator
responsiveness in moderate-to-severe copd is rather
variable and does not predict disease progression [99]. thus,
post-bronchodilator values may give a false impression of
poor reversibility as mean fev1 because a significant
proportion of subjects with poorly reversible copd at
enrolment will show substantial reversibility at the end of
the trial [90].
10.3 dissociation between fev1 and other end-point
variables

there is a dissociation between the minimal level of improvement in fev1 and other end-point measures (qol and delay
in the time to the next exacerbation) detected in most
phase iii trials. the 40-ml difference in fev1 between  xxxd1697xxx  and placebo is unlikely to explain the effect of  xxxd1697xxx  on health status and the recurrence of exacerbation
between groups. thus, what could be responsible for the
larger change in health status other than the small change in
fev1? the qol score measured with the sgrq survey
reached the minimal important difference of 4 u after only
6 months of therapy [100]. these findings are in line with
those recently reported for  xxxd3140xxx  in a similar large
6-month trial [101]. although the explanations for this discrepancy remain to be defined, it is possible to speculate that (due
to its systemic distribution)  xxxd1697xxx  may reach the distal airways and decrease inflammation around the small airways,
which may lead to changes in resting lung volumes rather
than dynamic lung function parameters. in addition, one may
speculate that other factors regarding the mode of action of
 xxxd1697xxx  are involved. copd is a systemic disease that is
associated with increased cytokine levels such as tnf-alpha.
thus, it may be possible that an improvement in qol and the
delay in exacerbations may be due to its systemic effect as well
as being less effective in improving fev1.
11. expert

opinion: therapeutic significance

pde4 inhibitors are being developed for asthma, arthritis,
psoriasis and copd. for copd,  xxxd1697xxx  is one of the

most advanced pde4 inhibitors (which has been evaluated in
phase i, ii and iii trials as well as in dose–response experiments); however, these trials have, demonstrated an inconsistent clinical significance regarding the level of lung function
improvement and perceived qol in patients with copd.
therefore, it remains unclear to what degree  xxxd1697xxx  can
provide true clinical improvement compared with
theophylline to date and whether it will compete against
presently available copd treatments (i.e., supplemental
oxygen, inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids and antibiotics) [102]. indeed, the lung function improvement was
smaller than that reported in a meta-analysis of theophylline
studies [103].  xxxd1697xxx  may possibly be beneficial as an
adjunct therapy, together with standard therapies (e.g., to be
used in combination with corticosteroids or beta2-agonists),
especially if longer-term studies show that the increases in
fev1 are more substantial. this view is based on the finding
that the drug is active in smokers (where it appears to be effective, whereas glucocorticoid is not [66]) and improvements in
lung function observed with  xxxd1697xxx  are independent of
smoking status [70]. in addition, it may emerge that phase iii
trials were misled in their use of post-bronchodilator values as
a means to predict disease progression or treatment effect [90],
and studies differently designed may reveal a similar improvement of lung function associated with  xxxd1697xxx  as was
observed in phase ii trials.
finally,  xxxd1697xxx  ≤ 15 mg b.i.d. is safe and well tolerated
in both short- and long-term dosing trials with a low
incidence of adverse effects. no evidence for drug–drug interactions with commonly prescribed medications for copd
and asthma (such as digoxin, corticosteroids, salbutamol,
theophylline or warfarin) were found. moreover, the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1697xxx  are essentially the same in
smokers and non-smokers, indicating that no dose
adjustments of  xxxd1697xxx  will be required in patients with
copd; however, full knowledge of the therapeutic value of
this novel type of compound awaits the outcome of
longer-term clinical trials.
