plasma hyaluronan biding protein ( xxxg1011xxx ) is a novel  xxxg745xxx , which has an amino acid sequence homology to that of  xxxg1044xxx  activator (hgfa), and has a similar domain structure to that of urinary plasminogen activator ( xxxg1767xxx ), found in human plasma. we searched the  xxxg1011xxx  substrate in human plasma
by measuring the digested protein bands on  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sdspage). the results showed that fibrinogen and fibronectin were the major substrates of  xxxg1011xxx .  xxxg1011xxx  cleaved
the a -chain at multiple sites and the b -chain between lysine53 and lysine54 but not the g -chain of fibrinogen.
therefore,  xxxg1011xxx  did not initiate the formation of the fibrin clot and did not cause the fibrinolysis directly.  xxxg1011xxx 
did not cleave (activate) prothrombin and plasminogen, but it converted the inactive single chain urinary plasminogen activator to the active two chain form.
key words  xxxg1011xxx ; fibrinogen; fibronectin; plasminogen activator; extracellular matrix

 xxxg1011xxx  ( xxxg1011xxx ) is a novel  xxxg745xxx  found in human plasma.1) the amino acid sequence of  xxxg1011xxx  is similar to that of  xxxg1044xxx  activator (hgfa).1) the domain structure of  xxxg1011xxx  is
composed of three  xxxg681xxx  (egf) domains,
one kringle domain and one  xxxg745xxx  domain from its
amino-terminus.1) this domain structure is similar to that of
urinary plasminogen activator ( xxxg1767xxx ), although  xxxg1767xxx  has
only one egf domain.2) additionally, the genes of  xxxg1011xxx  and
 xxxg1767xxx  locate closely on chromosome 10q25—q263) and on
chromosome 10q24,4) respectively, in humans.
 xxxg1011xxx  is present as the 70-kda inactive single chain precursor in human plasma. it transforms to the active two chain
form, 50-kda heavy chain and 27-kda light chain, which are
linked by a disulfide bond, by autocleavage. this process is
accelerated in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine and
 xxxd1860xxx  similar to factor xii ( xxxg743xxx ) of the
coagulation system. furthermore, the active heterodimer
form of  xxxg1011xxx  changes to the inactive form, 50-kda heavy
chain to two 26-kda fragments, and 27-kda light chain to
17-kda and 8-kda fragments, which are all bridged by disulfide linkages, by autocleavage. we identified the c1-inhibitor
as the major inhibitor of the  xxxg745xxx  activity of  xxxg1011xxx 
in human plasma, but the natural substrate of  xxxg1011xxx  has not
been elucidated yet. in this paper, we describe how  xxxg1011xxx 
converts inactive single chain urinary plasminogen activator
(scu-pa) to the active two chain form and cleaves a -chain
and b -chain of fibrinogen in a different manner from those of
thrombin and plasmin.
materials and methods
materials thrombin, prothrombin, plasmin, plasminogen and single chain tissue plasminogen activator (sct-pa)
were purchased from sigma. single chain urinary plasminogen activator (scu-pa) was obtained from techno clone,
austria. s-2444 (synthetic  xxxg1767xxx  substrate, l-pyroglutamylglycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline) was from chromogenix,
sweden and molecular weight standards for  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) were
from gibco brl.
purification of  xxxg1011xxx   xxxg1011xxx  was purified from human
∗ to whom correspondence should be addressed.

plasma with ac4 (anti- xxxg1011xxx  mouse monoclonal antibody)conjugated sepharose 4b as described previously. briefly,
human plasma (500 ml) was applied to the column of ac4sepharose (1 mg igg/ml sepharose, total volume of 50 ml).
after washings with 0.5 m nacl, 10 mm sodium phosphate
and 0.1% nonidet p-40, ph 7.4 (500 ml) and distilled water
(100 ml),  xxxg1011xxx  was eluted with 0.2 m glycine–hcl, ph 2.5
from the column. aliquots of the purified  xxxg1011xxx  were stored
in a freezer at 280 °c and were neutralized with 1 m tris before use.
sds-page sds-page was performed according to
laemmli using 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing or non-reducing conditions.5) after electrophoresis, the
proteins in the gel were stained with 0.1% coomassie brilliant blue r-250, 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol for 30
min at room temperature. the gel was destained in 10%
acetic acid and 30% methanol to obtain a clear back-ground.
purification of  xxxg1011xxx  substrate from human plasma
human plasma (500 ml) was fractionated with polyethylene
glycol (peg) 4000 to 0—5% precipitate, 5—12% precipitate, 12—23% precipitate and 23% supernatant as described
previously.6) each precipitate was dissolved in 10 mm tris–
hcl, ph 7.4 (500 ml). each fraction (1 m l) was incubated
with or without  xxxg1011xxx  (300 ng) in 50 mm tris–hcl and 100
mm nacl, ph 7.4 (total volume of 15 m l) at 37 °c for 1 h.
the samples were analyzed on sds-page and the digested
protein bands were observed after coomassie staining. the
major  xxxg1011xxx  substrate of 60 kda under reducing conditions
was purified from the 0—5% peg 4000 fraction with
columns of diethylaminoethyl (deae)-sephacel, phenyl
toyopearl 650m, bio gel a-0.5 m and hydroxyapatite.6)
amino acid sequence analysis the samples (100 pmol
each) were analyzed on sds-page (10% polyacrylamide
gel) under reducing conditions. after electrophoresis, the
proteins in the gel were transferred to a pro blot membrane
(perkin elmer applied biosystems) electrically. the proteins
on the membrane were stained with 0.1% coomassie brilliant
blue r-250, 1% acetic acid and 40% methanol for 1 min and
the membrane was destained in 50% methanol. the protein
bands were cut off and the amino acid sequences were analyzed with a 473a protein sequencer (perkin elmer applied
biosystems).

measurement of the activation of scu-pa by  xxxg1011xxx 
the conversion of inactive scu-pa to active two chain  xxxg1767xxx 
(tcu-pa) by  xxxg1011xxx  was measured according to yoshida et
al.7) s-2444 (final concentration of 0.65 mm, synthetic  xxxg1767xxx 
substrate), scu-pa (1 m g) and each amount of  xxxg1011xxx  were
mixed in 50 mm tris–hcl and 100 mm nacl, ph 7.4 (final
volume of 200 m l) using a 96-well microtiter plate. the plate
was incubated at 37 °c for the indicated time. the absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a microplate reader
model 450 (bio rad).
results
identification of the major  xxxg1011xxx  substrate in human
plasma the peg fractions were digested with  xxxg1011xxx  and
analyzed on sds-page under reducing conditions (fig. 1).
the results apparently indicated that the 60-kda band in the
0—5% peg fraction was the major  xxxg1011xxx  substrate in
human plasma. the minor substrate (over 200 kda) of  xxxg1011xxx 
was also observed in the same fraction. the 60-kda band
was purified with the columns of deae-sephacel, phenyl
toyopearl 650m, bio gel a-0.5 m and hydroxyapatite (data
not shown). the purified protein revealed a single band (over
200 kda) under non-reducing conditions, and 70-kda, 60kda abd 50-kda bands under reducing conditions (fig. 2).
the amino acid sequence analyses of the 70-kda and the 50kda bands indicated that they were the a -chain and the g chain of fibrinogen, respectively. we could not determine the
amino acid sequence of the 60-kda band due to the blocked
amino-terminal residue. fibrinogen is composed of two
chains each of the a -chain (70 kda), b -chain (60 kda) and g chain (50 kda) which are connected by disulfide bonds to
form 340-kda protein.8) the amino-terminal amino acid of
the b -chain is blocked by pyroglutamyl residue. we concluded that fibrinogen was the major substrate of  xxxg1011xxx  in
human plasma.
characterization of the fibrinogen cleavage by  xxxg1011xxx 
it is known that thrombin releases amino-terminal 16 amino
acids ( xxxg784xxx ) from the a -chain and amino-terminal 14 amino acids ( xxxg785xxx ) from the b -chain of
fibrinogen to produce fibrin, which is the origin of the coagulation.9) on the other hand, plasmin cleaves all chains of fibrinogen and fibrin at the multiple sites to cause the fibrinolysis.10,11) we compared the fibrinogen cleavage by  xxxg1011xxx  with
those by thrombin and plasmin (fig. 3). thrombin reduced
the molecular weight of fibrinogen slightly and plasmin
caused the fragmentation of fibrinogen under non-reducing
conditions.  xxxg1011xxx  caused more molecular weight reduction
than that of thrombin under non-reducing conditions. thrombin digestion of fibrinogen showed cleavages of the a -chain
and the b -chain but not the g -chain under reducing conditions. the fragmentations of all chains of fibrinogen were observed in the plasmin digestion under reducing conditions. in
 xxxg1011xxx  treatment, the a -chain and the b -chain disappeared
and the g -chain band became dense. the amino acid sequence analysis of this dense band of the g -chain showed the
amino-terminal sequence of the g -chain and the sequence
from lysine54 of the b -chain. these results suggested that
 xxxg1011xxx  cleaved the a -chain and the b -chain but not the g chain of fibrinogen, and each chain was connected by disulfide linkages to form the macromolecule (over 200 kda). we

investigated whether  xxxg1011xxx  initiated the formation of fibrin
clots in solution and whether  xxxg1011xxx  caused fibrinolysis in
zymography.12) as we expected, both results were negative
(data not shown).
activation of scu-pa by  xxxg1011xxx  we then examined
whether  xxxg1011xxx  cleaved (activated) prothrombin and plasminogen, and both results were negative (data not shown).
however,  xxxg1011xxx  cleaved sct-pa (data not shown), and scu-pa
(50 kda) to 30-kda and 18-kda fragments (fig. 4). it is
known that inactive scu-pa is cleaved to the active two chain
form (30-kda and 18-kda subunits).13) accordingly we studied whether  xxxg1011xxx  activated scu-pa using synthetic  xxxg1767xxx 
substrate, s-24447) (fig. 5). scu-pa alone and  xxxg1011xxx  alone
did not hydrolyse s-2444 efficiently. but the mixture of scupa and  xxxg1011xxx  hydrolysed s-2444 effectively, indicating that
 xxxg1011xxx  converted inactive scu-pa to the active dimer form.
scu-pa was activated by  xxxg1011xxx  in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 6).

100 mm nacl, ph 7.4 (total volume of 15 m l) at 37 °c for 1 h. the samples were analyzed on sds-page (12.5% polyacrylamide gel) under reducing conditions. after
electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were stained with coomassie brilliant blue r250. m: molecular weight standards, 1: scu-pa and 2: 11phbp.

discussion
in this paper, we described that  xxxg1011xxx  cleaved the a -chain
and the b -chain, but not the g -chain, of fibrinogen and fibronectin.  xxxg1011xxx  may act as an initial inhibitor of the coagulation which occurred at a local place in the body, because
 xxxg1011xxx  cleaved the a -chain at multiple sites, and cleaved between lysine53 and lysine54 of the b -chain of fibrinogen. the
released fragments from the a -chain and the b -chain of fibrinogen by  xxxg1011xxx  might have some physiological function,
although the cleavage sites in the a -chain have not been determined. in fibrin formation, thrombin releases amino-terminal 16 amino acids peptide ( xxxg784xxx ) which has
anti-thrombin action14) from the a -chain. it also releases
amino-terminal 14 amino acids peptide ( xxxg785xxx )
which increases rat blood pressure,15) potentiates contractions
of the rat uterus in response to bradykinin,16) and serves as a
weak chemoattractant for human neutrophil,17) from the b chain of fibrinogen.
 xxxg1011xxx  did not cleave (activate) prothrombin or plasminogen; however, it cleaved sct-pa and scu-pa. it has been
reported that both sct-pa and two chain  xxxg1766xxx  (tct-pa) have
similar activities,18) but scu-pa showed little activity while
tcu-pa was more active.13) the active tcu-pa converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin.19) plasmin causes fibrinolysis,10,11) degrades various components of the extracellular
matrix such as fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycan and collagen,20,21) and also activates latent matrix metaloproteases22)
and growth factors.24)  xxxg1011xxx  may act as the initial factor of
the above pathway.
we also tried to purify the minor  xxxg1011xxx  substrate of over
200 kda on sds-page under reducing conditions from a
0—5% peg fraction of human plasma. nevertheless, we
failed to isolate it because the solution gelled during the
ultra-filtration, before gel-filtration. however, we could identify this protein as fibronectin by western-blot analysis with
the commercial anti-human fibronectin mouse monoclonal
antibody. we may be able to detect the other more minor substrates of  xxxg1011xxx  using more sensitive detection methods.
