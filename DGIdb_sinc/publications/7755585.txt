expression of human all-trans- xxxg1932xxx  and its ligand-binding domain in escherichia coli.  all-trans- xxxd3417xxx , one of the hormonally active derivatives of  xxxd3105xxx , occurs physiologically in plasma at a concentration below 10 nmol/l. the methods currently used for its quantification are based on hplc, need about 1 ml of serum, are relatively laborious and thus not well suited for mass analysis. the affinity and specificity of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors for all-trans- xxxd3417xxx  encouraged us to express both the entire human  xxxg1932xxx  ( xxxg1932xxx ) and two versions of its  xxxd3417xxx -binding domain in escherichia coli in the hope that these recombinant proteins might be used as binders in a ligand-binding assay for all-trans- xxxd3417xxx . the recombinant receptors, the whole receptor [ xxxg1932xxx -(v7-q448)], corresponding to domains a-f, and the ligand-binding domain [ xxxg1932xxx -(e149-q448)], corresponding to domains d-f, were expressed in the vector pet 3d/bl21 (de3) as inclusion bodies, solubilized with guanidinium chloride, renatured and purified by ion-exchange chromatography.  xxxg1932xxx -(p193-q448), corresponding to domains e-f, was expressed in the vector pet 3d/bl21(de3)plyss, and purified by reversed-phase chromatography. under non-denaturing conditions, the expressed whole receptor [ xxxg1932xxx -(v7-q448)] and the d-f construct ( xxxg1932xxx -(e149-q448)] behaved chromatographically as monomeric proteins whereas the e-f construct [ xxxg1932xxx -(p193-q448)] had a strong tendency to aggregate.  xxxg1932xxx -(v7-q448) and  xxxg1932xxx -(e149-q448) had similar kd values for all-trans- xxxd3417xxx  (1.4 and 0.6 nmol/l respectively) whereas  xxxg1932xxx -(p193-q448) bound all-trans- xxxd3417xxx  less avidly (kd 9.6 nmol/l). 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  bound to  xxxg1932xxx -(e149-q448) and  xxxg1932xxx -(v7-q448) as avidly as all-trans- xxxd3417xxx . competition experiments showed weak or no binding of 4-oxo-all-trans- xxxd3417xxx , 4-oxo-13-cis- xxxd3417xxx , 13-cis- xxxd3417xxx ,  xxxd71xxx  and retinol by  xxxg1932xxx -(e149-q448).
