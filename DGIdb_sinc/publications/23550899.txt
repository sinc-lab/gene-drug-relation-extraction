chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods using
a triple-quad mass spectrometer equipped with a heated
electrospray ionization interface [30]. metabolites identified in
urine indicated the metabolic pathways responsible for their
generation [26]. mean urinary recovery of drug-related radioactivity found that nearly 48% of the metabolites were generated
from amide hydrolysis of  xxxd2650xxx  by endogenous esterases
(m5 [deacylated  xxxd2650xxx ], m16-nv-acetylated] and
m17) [26]. cyp3a4/5 mediated n-dealkylation or oxidation
of the secondary amine accounts for 18% of the urinary metabolites including (m8 [ xxxd2650xxx -n-a-oxidation body (phenylacetic acid derivative)], m15 [ xxxd2650xxx -n-o-glucuronide])
and m18- n-coo-glucuronide [30].
glucuronidation is involved in generation m11, m12,
m13 and m14, which together account for 34% of urine
metabolites. glucuronidation consist of several conjugation
mechanisms including o-glucuronic acid conjugation that produces m11 [ xxxd2650xxx -o-glucuronide], n-glucuronic acid
conjugation is responsible for m14 [ xxxd2650xxx -nw-glucuronide], whereas carbamoyl glucuronic acid conjugation generates
m12 [ xxxd2650xxx  ketone oxidation body] and m13 [ xxxd2650xxx -n-coo-glucuronide] [26]. the role of cyp3a4/5 in
metabolism of  xxxd2650xxx  was supported by in vitro studies
on human liver microsomes, which reported that metabolism
of  xxxd2650xxx  correlated significantly with the testosterone
6-beta-hydroxylation [28]. antagonism of cyp3a4 by antiserum
blocked 80% of the  xxxd2650xxx ’s metabolism.
since the total systemic exposure of pharmacologically
inactive metabolites m11 and m12 is 17 and 10%, respectively (> 10%) they are qualified as major metabolites based
on ich m3 (r2) guidelines [20]. the slowest step in the elimination of  xxxd2650xxx  is likely to be metabolism as t1/2 for
none of the metabolites (m5, m11, m12, m13, m14,
m16, m17) was longer than parent drug [20]. except for
m13, the plasma exposure for all circulating metabolites was
higher in women than in men [20], but m13 only contributes
< 2% of total drug-related plasma exposure and 0.07% of the
dose in urine is contributed by m13.
effect of renal impairment
urinary recovery of administered oral dose of  xxxd2650xxx  as
unchanged parent drug and metabolites was nearly 20% [24]
to 55% [26]. there is a slight variability in ae0 -- t% caused
by pharmacogenetics of cyp2d6 [29] and gender [20]. in addition, there are gender differences in plasma exposure after oral
administration of  xxxd2650xxx  [18,20,24] and the reports of
comparatively lower clr in women [31].
age and weight matched subjects of both sexes were classified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) into
healthy subjects with no impairment of renal function or
those with mild, moderate, or severe impairment (n = 8 per
group) for an open-label, parallel-group study [25]. after a single oral dose of  xxxd2650xxx , the geometric mean auc0 -- inf
was 31, 66 and 118% higher in subjects with mild, moderate
and severe renal impairment, respectively compared to healthy

subjects. the increase in cmax of subjects with mild, moderate
and severe renal impairment was 6, 23 and 92%, respectively.
study concluded that renal function correlates with clr, but
not with apparent total body clearance of  xxxd2650xxx .
effect of hepatic impairment
the published article discussed above [25] for effect of renal
impairment on  xxxd2650xxx , also described a separate study
that was designed to determine the impact of hepatic
impairment. child--pugh classification for hepatic function
was used to stratify both male and female subjects (n = 8 per
group) into either healthy subjects with no hepatic impairment
or those with mild, moderate hepatic impairment. subjects
with hepatic impairment were matched for sex, age and body
mass index (bmi) to healthy controls. progressively higher
auc0 -- inf of 19 and 65% was recorded in subjects with
mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects [25]. mild and moderate hepatic
impairment raised the cmax by 9 and 175%, respectively
over healthy subjects. study could not detect any association
between pk parameters and child--pugh scores. due to the
intrinsic intersubject variability in pk parameters of  xxxd2650xxx  seen in healthy adults [20], a significant overlap in the
plasma exposures of healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic
or renal impairment [25] was not a surprising finding.
2.4.4

effect of gender and age on pks of  xxxd2650xxx 
studies to determine oral bioavailability [24] and proarrythmic
safety [18] of  xxxd2650xxx  noted gender differences in plasma
exposure at all doses of  xxxd2650xxx  and in safety at higher
doses. during single oral dose administration of  xxxd2650xxx 
(25 -- 100 mg) for bioavailability, females showed 64% higher
auc0 -- inf and < 45% higher cmax, compared to males [24].
higher plasma exposure in females relative to males was also
noted at steady state reached after daily dosing for 10 days
in a safety study [18], where females showed ~ 40 -- 50% higher
auc0 -- t for a single dosing interval of 24 h and 30 -- 60%
higher mean cmax [18]. systemic clearance (cl/f) was
also ~ 30 -- 40% lower in females.
initial findings from smaller single dose studies prompted a
larger study to investigate the effect of gender and effect of
multiple dose levels on the pks of  xxxd2650xxx . the age associated increased prevalence of oab [32] justified the investigation on the effect of age on the pks of  xxxd2650xxx .
comparison of single- and multiple-dose pks in young
(18 -- 45 years) and elderly subjects (‡ 55 years) of mostly
caucasian descent was recently reported for  xxxd2650xxx  [20].
the report described two separate studies conducted on
96 and 75 subjects, respectively.
first study employed a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, multiple dose--escalation study design for a total of
six separate dose levels (four for young and two for elderly).
twelve subjects (six men and six women) were randomly
assigned to receive either (50, 100, 200 and 300 mg)  xxxd2650xxx  ocas tablets for young and only 50 and 200 mg for

elderly subjects. on day 1 of the study, 12 subjects received a
single dose of  xxxd2650xxx  and 4 subjects received placebo,
followed by a 3-day washout and once-daily dosing for
10 days at selected dose level.
second open-label crossover study enrolled 75 subjects,
where 36 healthy young (18 men and 18 women) and 39 older
(21 men and 18 women) subjects were stratified by age and sex
and randomized to receive 1 of 6 treatment sequences, where
each subject received 2 out of 3 possible doses of  xxxd2650xxx 
ocas (25, 50 and 100 mg) in random sequence separated by
a minimum of 14 days. subjects received a loading dose of  xxxd2650xxx  twice daily on day 1, followed by once daily dosing for
6 days. premature discontinuation of treatment was reported for
six subjects due to hematocrit measurements below the normal
range recorded prior to treatment period and other two subjects
withdrew due to withdrawal of consent and serious adverse event.
steady state auc0 -- t seems to be achieved within 7 days of
once-daily dosing at all doses of  xxxd2650xxx . analysis of variance (anova) of auc0 -- t and cmax following multiple
doses of 25 -- 100 mg revealed no significant differences
between older subjects (‡ 55 years) and young subjects. the
90% ci for auc0 -- t and cmax ratios (both sexes) fell within
the default equivalence limits of 0.80 and 1.25.
in contrast to age, anova analysis found significant effect
of gender on  xxxd2650xxx  pks, with significantly higher cmax
and auc0 -- t (38 -- 44%), respectively, in women of all age
groups compared to men.
similar results were obtained for the elderly subpopulation
aged ‡ 65 years (the current age cutoff for elder hood in the
international conference on harmonization [ich]). compared to younger men, a small decrease in cmax was noted
in older and elderly men, whereas auc0 -- t was only slightly
decreased in older but not in elderly men. plasma exposure for
metabolites of  xxxd2650xxx  discussed in section 2.4.2 was also
measured and it was found similar in all age groups for m12,
m13 and m16. a general age associated increase in plasma
exposure for m5, m8, m11, m14 and m15 was noted with
mean increases in auc0 -- t ranging from 27% for m14 to
62% for m8 in older subjects. higher values of cmax and
auc0 -- t were noted for m11 and m12 in women relative
to men, but there was no difference in the plasma exposure
of metabolites between older and younger women.
the tmax for  xxxd2650xxx  was found to independent of age
in both single dose and multiple dose studies. biphasic decline
was noted in plasma curve, which suggests multicompartmental elimination of  xxxd2650xxx  with a faster and slower
elimination phase. the elimination t1/2 was dependent on
regimen and ranged from ~ 26 to 37 h in first study and
54 to 65 h in study 2. mean estimates of clr ranged from
10.4 to 19.6 l/h in young subjects and ae0 -- t% and clr
were generally lower in older and elderly subjects, and lowest
in elderly women, consistent with the generally lower renal
capacity of women and elderly [31]. mean t1/2 was generally
slightly longer in elderly and in women, compared to men,
whereas ae0 -- t% tended to be higher in women.

time-dependency and dose-dependency in pks
of  xxxd2650xxx 

2.4.6

auc values measured from single dose and steady state levels
in 171 subjects [20] were compared to assess any dose dependency in pks of  xxxd2650xxx . comparison of auc0 -- inf and
auc0 -- t revealed doubling of plasma exposure at steady
state. approximately dose proportional increase was observed
in single dose auc0 -- inf of  xxxd2650xxx . the age independent
difference between auc0 -- t and auc0 -- inf suggests time
dependent nonlinear pks at doses of ‡ 100 mg either due to
increased bioavailability or autoinhibition of cyp2d6 [33].
no apparent change in t1/2 or clr was observed with repeat
dosing of  xxxd2650xxx .
dose-nonproportionality was observed in both auc0 -- inf
and cmax after single doses in single dose crossover studies [24].
doubling of the dose within the range of 25 -- 100 mg once
daily at steady state also resulted in an estimated increase in
cmax and auc0 -- t of 3.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively. deviations from dose proportionality were in general independent
of age and gender of subjects [20]. dose dependent increase
in ae0 -- t% for  xxxd2650xxx  and its metabolites was noted in
young subjects from 6.6% at 25 mg to 18% at 300 mg.
non-linearity for other pk parameters such as tmax, t1/2,
and clr was not detected [20].
drug interaction
the ability of  xxxd2650xxx  to inhibit the activity of the most
relevant cyp enzymes, including  xxxg575xxx /2,2b6,2c8,
2c9,2c19, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx , 3a4/5 were studied in vitro using
human liver microsomes [33].
except for cyp2d6, the in vitro concentration of  xxxd2650xxx  required for mediating 50% inhibitory concentration
(ic50) with and without pre-incubation amounted
to > 100 mmol/l [33] which is 370-fold higher than cmax
measured in human pk studies [18,20,24]. therefore,  xxxd2650xxx  is predicted not to cause clinically significant drug--drug
interactions based on its therapeutic plasma exposure range of
79 -- 630 ng·h/ml and the high ic50 values needed for inhibition of  xxxg575xxx /2,2b6, 2c8, 2c9,2c19,  xxxd851xxx , 3a4/5.
however, study found  xxxd2650xxx  to be a time-dependent
inhibitor of cyp2d6 with ic50 decreasing threefold from
13 mmol/l to 4.3 mmol/l after its 30-min pre-incubation
with human liver microsomes [33].
the (quasi-) irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibition
of cyp2d6 by  xxxd2650xxx  may lead to metabolic drug--drug
interactions when other drugs metabolized by cyp2d6 are
co-administered [28]. though,  xxxd2650xxx  did not inhibit or
induce cyp3a4/5 [33], but they make significant contribution
in hepatic clearance of  xxxd2650xxx , therefore drug--drug interactions may occur with concomitant administration of drugs
that exert inducible (rifampin) or inhibitory (ketoconazole)
effect on those enzymes [34]. in addition, drug interaction
can also occur from effect of other drugs on efflux transporters
such as p-gp [27], that play a role in oral bioavailability of
 xxxd2650xxx  [24].
2.4.7

interaction of  xxxd2650xxx  with inhibitors and inducers of
cyp3a4 was studied by two-period, one sequence crossover
study design. interaction of  xxxd2650xxx  with cyp3a4 and
p-gp inhibitor ketoconazole was studied in 24 healthy adult
subjects with equal number of both sexes [35]. single dose of
 xxxd2650xxx  (100 mg) was administered on day 1 in period
1 and on day 4 in period 2, which also involved multiple dosing of ketoconazole (400 mg qd) daily from day 1 to 9. the
steady state plasma levels of ketoconazole caused a 1.4- and
1.8-fold increase in cmax and auc0 -- inf, respectively. the
effect of ketoconazole on  xxxd2650xxx  exposure is well
explained by an increase in bioavailability due to inhibition
of p-gp efflux and cyp3a4-mediated first-pass metabolism
as well as reduced metabolic clearance. the increased
ae0 -- t% of  xxxd2650xxx  in presence of ketoconazole observed
in this phase i study [35] is apparently similar to the increased
ae0 -- t% in cyp2d6 pm individuals [29] suggesting reduced
metabolic clearance of  xxxd2650xxx  mediated by cyp3a4 in
presence of ketoconazole [35]. although, there were differences
in the formulation of  xxxd2650xxx  used in two studies, which
may also impact the pk parameters.
rifampin is a potent inducer of several cyp isoforms
including  xxxg590xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c9 and 2c19, and is a weak
inducer of cyp1a2, ugt and transporters including p-gp.
the interaction of  xxxd2650xxx  with rifampin was studied in
a one sequence, crossover study in 24 healthy (13 male and
11 female) volunteers [36]. in this 15 day study, effect of repeat
doses of rifampin 600 mg daily given from fifth day onward
for 10 days was studied on the pks of a single dose of  xxxd2650xxx  (100 mg) administered on day 1 and on day 12. in contrast to the increase in cmax and auc0 -- inf of  xxxd2650xxx  in
presence of ketoconazole, the co-administration of rifampicin
led to a moderate 0.35- and 0.44-fold decrease in cmax and
auc0 -- inf of  xxxd2650xxx , which could be related to induction of p-gp in intestine, leading to reduced oral bioavailability of  xxxd2650xxx , which is consistent with lack of effect on
t1/2 of  xxxd2650xxx . the ae0 -- t% of  xxxd2650xxx  decreased
from 7.8 to 4.5% in presence of rifampin [36]. consistent
with strong induction of the  xxxg590xxx  and ugt mediated
metabolism of  xxxd2650xxx  by rifampicin, the ratio to parent
drug to metabolites m8 and m15 in plasma also increased.
tmax of  xxxd2650xxx  remain unchanged with ketoconazole [35],
but was hastened in presence of rifampicin from 3.5 to 2.7 h.
hastening of tmax was probably related to higher expression
of transporters in presence of rifampin causing an efficient
distribution of  xxxd2650xxx  to different tissues.
effect of cyp2d6 inhibition by  xxxd2650xxx  was studied
using the same study design as in preceding paragraph for
cyp3a4 by replacing ketoconazole with  xxxd2650xxx  and
replacing  xxxd2650xxx  with desipramine (an antidepressant
and cyp2d6 substrate) in the foregoing study conducted
on 28 healthy volunteers for 38 days [34]. single oral dose of
50 mg desipramine was given on 1st, 18th and 38th day of
the study.  xxxd2650xxx  100 mg was administered daily from
5th day to 23rd day to achieve steady state levels. interaction

of multiple doses of  xxxd2650xxx  with single dose of desipramine led to longer t1/2 of desipramine and a 1.8- and
3.4-fold increase in cmax and auc0 -- inf, respectively. the
incidence of adverse events was low and similar across treatments groups in different studies.

clinca
the efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  in oab has been demonstrated by
reduced number of incontinent days, mean voided volume,
urgency episodes and micturition frequency in randomized
controlled trials. the treatment outcomes were recorded
from patient-completed diaries submitted at the final
visit of treatment period ranging from 2 weeks to
12 months [13-15,17,37]. health-related quality of life (hrql)
assessments were also made using various instruments at
baseline and at the end of treatment.
enrolled oab patients in these trials study had on average
oab symptoms for at least 3 months and were willing to
complete the micturition diary. patients recorded at least
3 episodes of severe urgency and have average frequency
of > 8 voiding episodes in a 24 period recorded in 3 day micturition diary preceding to enrollment. patients were excluded
from these trials, if they could not safely stop the use of other
oab medications, or had symptomatic urinary tract infection; clinically relevant stress incontinence, an indwelling
catheter chronic inflammation, bladder stones, previous pelvic
radiation therapy, previous or current malignant disease of the
pelvic organs or severe hypertension.
 xxxd2650xxx  met the primary efficacy endpoints in phase iii
randomized placebo controlled trial for once-daily dosing for
12 weeks at 50 and 100 mg dose [12]. compared to placebo,
statistically significant reduction in mean number micturitions per 24 h and incontinence episodes was observed at final
visit from baseline [12]. apart from dose dependent increase in

respective baseline values and reduction of only -1.17 in placebo group [11]. adjusted mean decrease in number of micturitions per 24 h of 1.93 and -1.77 at 50 mg and 100 mg dose
was also significant on final visit from baseline and only1.34 for placebo. pooled efficacy analysis of phase iii pivotal
trials showed that although the dose of 50 mg achieved the
primary efficacy endpoints, it resulted only in a modest reduction of 0.55 micturitions/24 h and 0.44 incontinence
episodes/24 h compared with placebo [38].
other key efficacy end points and hrql outcomes were also
met by  xxxd2650xxx . long-term efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  was
assessed during a 12-month long study, where both  xxxd2650xxx 
and active control of  xxxd3398xxx  successfully met secondary efficacy endpoint of the study with measured improvement in key
oab symptoms at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months relative to baseline
values recorded at the time of enrollment [10].
encouraged by efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  in pre-clinical
studies on bladder outlet obstruction [37], a recent study
evaluated efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  in 52 oab patients suffering
from benign prostatic hyperplasia and 45 oab patients unresponsive to antimuscarinic agents [19]. enrolled patients
received 50 mg  xxxd2650xxx  once daily for upto 8 weeks
and were evaluated by oab symptom score (oabss), international prostate symptom score-quality of life (ipss-qol)
index, and ipss at baseline and at end of treatment. effectiveness of  xxxd2650xxx  decreased from 85.2% in newly diagnosed
oab patients to 61.6 % in oab patients unresponsive to
antimuscarinic agents. newly diagnosed oab patients treated
with antimuscarinic agents served as control group.
in addition to taking  xxxd2650xxx , bph patients were
allowed to continue with their treatment of a1 blocker.  xxxd2650xxx  significantly improved each domain of oabss and
ipss-qol index without any significant difference compared
to antimuscarinic therapy. results supported use of  xxxd2650xxx 
in combination with a1 blocker for male wet oab.  xxxd2650xxx  was less effective against night time urine frequency than
controls. there was a slight increase in post-void residual
(pvr) by  xxxd2650xxx , but the increase was non-significant.
the study found that around two-fifths of oab patients will
respond neither to  xxxd2650xxx  nor to antimuscarinic agents.

 xxxd3398xxx ) were most commonly reported, followed by
headache (6.9% on  xxxd2650xxx  vs. 9.4% on  xxxd3398xxx ).
but, the comparative incidence of dizziness and palpitations
was slightly higher with  xxxd2650xxx .
the tolerability and incidence of teae with once daily
administration of  xxxd2650xxx  for 12 weeks at 50 and
100 mg dose was similar to  xxxd3398xxx  extended release
4 mg [11]. incidence of dry mouth with 50 mg mirbegron
was even lower than that of placebo (0.5 vs. 1.5%), but it
rose to 2.1% at 100 mg [12]. the effect of  xxxd2650xxx  on
pvr was comparable to placebo group [12]. the most frequent teaes included hypertension, urinary tract infections,
nasopharyngitis, headache, constipation and dry mouth
occurring at a similar incidence across all treatment groups,
except for dry mouth, which was highest in the  xxxd3398xxx 
group (8.6%) versus  xxxd2650xxx  50 mg (2.8%) and 100 mg
(2.3%) [12]. increased incidence for a variety of neoplasms
was noted in phase iii trials submitted to fda by astellas
especially in the  xxxd2650xxx  100 mg group compared to
placebo [38]. it remains to be investigated if the neoplasm
risk is true  xxxd2650xxx -related effect or not.
incidence of mild teaes was 8.4% at lower daily dose of
50 mg  xxxd2650xxx  for 4 -- 8 weeks in bph patients [19].
tolerability assessments at higher doses (100 and 200 mg)
for 12 week therapy of  xxxd2650xxx  included physical examinations, supine blood pressure and pulse rate, orthostatic
stress testing, resting 12-lead ecgs, clinical laboratory tests
(biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis) and adverseevents monitoring using investigators’ questionnaires and
subjects’ spontaneous reports [11,12].
a statistically significant increase in mean pulse rate of
1 beats per minute was reported in  xxxd2650xxx  treated
patients at the final visit on 12 week relative to baseline [40].
the higher pulse rate in  xxxd2650xxx -treated patients was not
associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular
adverse events. rise in pulse rate of  xxxd2650xxx  treated
patients prompted a detailed investigation on effect of  xxxd2650xxx  on the heart rate (hr) and cardiac repolarization
(qt interval) [18]. a total of 44 healthy males and 44 healthy
females were enrolled in a placebo controlled study to determine the effect of steady state plasma  xxxd2650xxx  levels on
hr and qt interval at therapeutic (50 -- 100 mg) and supra2.6 sa

and on the last drug administration day.  xxxd2650xxx  did not
cross the threshold of 10 ms for the largest time-matched drug
effect on qtc within therapeutic dose range of 50 -- 100 mg
in either sex. only in females, at 200 mg supratherapeutic
dose,  xxxd2650xxx  crossed the threshold by prolonging the
qtci interval at 0.5 -- 6 h and  xxxd1891xxx  h post-dosing. the effect
on supine pulse rate noted in earlier study was, therefore, gender dependent. the increased effect on pulse rate of elderly
and women may be related to increased plasma exposure
noted in women groups in different clinical studies [16,19,28].
safety of  xxxd2650xxx  at 50 mg and 100 mg dose on
long-term administration of 12 months was determined
with around 800 oab patients at each dose level [10]. the primary endpoint of the study was safety, which was measured in
terms of incidence and severity of teaes. incidence of mild
or moderate teaes was 59.7 and 61.3% with two doses of
 xxxd2650xxx , respectively, and 62.6% with tolterdine, suggesting comparable tolerability of  xxxd2650xxx  and  xxxd3398xxx  er
4 mg. most common teaes was dry mouth, and its
incidence at 50 mg mirbegron dose was 2.8% compared to
8.6% with  xxxd3398xxx  [10].
on the 12th month final visit relative to baseline,  xxxd2650xxx  treated patients at 50 and 100 mg dose showed an
adjusted mean rise of 0.2 and 0.4 mm hg in morning systolic
blood pressure, respectively. in contrast, 800 patients taking
tolterdine daily for 12 months showed an adjusted mean
decrease in morning systolic blood pressure from baseline to
final visit. although, incidence of tachycardia at 100 mg
dose of  xxxd2650xxx  was comparable to tolterdine, it was lowered at 50 mg dose [10]. overall, compared to the antimuscarinics, the incidence of dry mouth is lower with  xxxd2650xxx 
(2.1 and 1.5%) and constipation (< 2%) was also notably
lower in the  xxxd2650xxx  treated groups than what is reported
in randomized, controlled trials of other oab agents (dry
mouth 9 to 34%, constipation 4 to 21%).

 xxxd2650xxx  is a novel, orally active treatment for oab with
proven efficacy and good tolerability. over 5000 oab
patients have been treated with  xxxd2650xxx  at doses of 50 or
100 mg from 6 weeks to 12 months with statistically significant improvements in daily micturition episodes and number
of incontinence episodes. the efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  achieved
through a distinct mechanism of action is comparable to existing drugs for oab. the clinically relevant efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  including improved hrql measures over placebo has
also been demonstrated in both newly diagnosed oab and
patients who had been treated with antimuscarinics.
clinical studies [13-15,17,39] reported that the incidence and
severity of teae in  xxxd2650xxx -treated patients was similar
to antimuscarinics. compared to oab patients treated with
 xxxd3398xxx , the incidence of dry mouth is more than threefold
lower in  xxxd2650xxx  treated patients. low risk of dry mouth
is comparable to placebo group, which may increase treatment adherence to  xxxd2650xxx  in elderly oab patients. the
use of  xxxd2650xxx  in elderly patients should be balanced
against the risk of cardiovascular side effects, which is reported
in studies ranging from 12 weeks to 12 months. the risk of
cardiovascular toxicity is most evident at higher doses in
females, but the risk is comparable to placebo at lower
therapeutic doses.
the potential risk of cardiac effects in presence of drug
interaction due to cyp2d6 inhibition by  xxxd2650xxx  has
not been evaluated so far. widely prescribed anti-hypertensive
drugs such as metoprolol is metabolized by cyp2d6 and,
therefore, cyp2d6 inhibition by  xxxd2650xxx  is likely to alter
the plasma exposure of metoprolol. since hypertension is
frequently a co-morbidity of oab, caution may be necessary
in use of  xxxd2650xxx  for treating oab symptoms in patients

on pvr from administration of  xxxd2650xxx , which is consistent with animal studies that showed absence of any effect on
detrusor contractility [37].  xxxd2650xxx  improves oab symptoms by enhancing storage function and relaxing the urinary
bladder. efficacy of  xxxd2650xxx  in treating symptom of nocturia may not be comparable to antimuscarinics. adding  xxxd2650xxx  to a1-blocker for treating male wet oab may be an
option but combination may lower the treatment satisfaction
for lower urinary tract symptoms. the current standard therapy for oab is antimuscarinic drugs, which are known to
interact with muscarinic mechanisms that are necessary for
mental functions.
 xxxd2650xxx  seems to exhibit non-linear dose dependent
increase in cmax and auc0 -- t in both sexes without any
change in t1/2. the non-linearity is confirmed by changes in
bioavailability and ae0 -- t%. the reported sex differences in
plasma exposure of  xxxd2650xxx  are reduced but not eliminated by weight normalization of (cmax and auc0 -- t). the
pk profile of  xxxd2650xxx  metabolites mirror that of the parent drug, which suggest that non-linear increase in plasma
exposure (cmax and auc0 -- t) may not be due to saturable
first-pass metabolism.
cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 enzymes are partly responsible for
metabolism of  xxxd2650xxx  and studies have reported differences
in plasma exposure of  xxxd2650xxx  between em and pm for
cyp2d6. these differences can be accentuated by pronounced
role of transporters (p-gp) in absorption and excretion.
ketoconazole and rifampicin not only inhibit and induce
cyp3a4, respectively, but they also have similar effect on
intestinal p-gp, which suggest that first pass metabolism and
bioavailability of  xxxd2650xxx  is altered in presence of these

two drugs. since the mechanism of action of  xxxd2650xxx 
is different from antimuscarinics, it may encourage pharmaceutical companies to combine two agents at lower doses to
improve efficacy and lower side effects. however, such combination therapy of oab should merit careful consideration for
antimuscarinic drugs with high ae0 -- t% that are excreted
unchanged in urine such as trospium and solifenacin.  xxxd2650xxx  [24] is also excreted as unchanged drug, and if both drugs
compete for the same excretion pathway it can result in higher
plasma exposure for either of the drugs.
the lower propensity of  xxxd2650xxx  to cause dry mouth
may make it an attractive drug candidate for oab patients
not responding to existing antimuscarinic agents. apart
from improved safety, patient compliance for the treatment
regimen will be assisted by once-daily formulation of
 xxxd2650xxx . compared to antimuscarinics, there is considerable variability in plasma exposure of  xxxd2650xxx  [20,25].
however, based on the available information, there does not
seem to be any need for dose adjustment based on age, gender
or cyp2d6 polymorphism.  xxxd2650xxx  has limited potential
for drug interactions and the low 50 mg dose provides a sufficient margin for increased plasma exposure from cyp3a4
inhibition by ketoconazole like drugs. in coming years,
pharmaceutical may combine lower doses of  xxxd2650xxx  and
antimuscarinic for improved safety and treatment adherence
in oab.
