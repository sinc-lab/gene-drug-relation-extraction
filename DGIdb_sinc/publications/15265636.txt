abstract
the activation of ␣2 -adrenoceptors has been reported to impair memory functions in both rats and humans. the ␣2 -adrenoceptor subtype
responsible for this detrimental effect is still unknown. the effect of the ␣2 -agonists clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  on memory processes, in
dependence to the time of administration, was evaluated in the mouse passive avoidance test. clonidine (0.02–0.2 mg kg−1 i.p.) and  xxxd2241xxx  (0.1–0.3 mg kg−1 i.p.) induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. from time–course experiments emerged that the impairment
of memory function was detectable only when clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  were administered 60 min before or immediately after the training
test, respectively. this detrimental effect was prevented by pretreatment with the ␣2 -antagonist yohimbine (1–3 mg kg−1 i.p.) and by the
␣2a -antagonist brl-44408 (0.3–1 mg kg−1 i.p.). by contrast, the ␣2b,c antagonists arc-239 (10 mg kg−1 i.p.) and  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg kg−1
i.p.) did not revert the amnesia induced by both clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx . at the highest effective doses, clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  were devoid of behavioral side-effects as well as maintained unaltered the motor coordination, as revealed by the rota-rod test. furthermore, none of
the compounds used modified the spontaneous motility as indicated by the animex apparatus. these results indicate that clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  impaired memory processes in a mouse passive avoidance paradigm through the selective activation of the ␣2a -adrenoceptor subtype.

1. introduction
agonists of ␣2 -adrenoceptors produce a wide variety of
central and peripheral effects. these include an antihypertensive action, alleviation of opiate-withdrawal syndrome,
antinociception, cardiovascular control, feeding, and sedation [37]. they have many clinical uses: to lower blood
pressure [48], promote anesthesia [30], ameliorate symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorders [24,43]. this broad range of effects
is consistent with the broad projections of the noradrenergic system along the length of the neuroaxis. subtypes
of ␣2 -adrenoceptors were originally discovered by bylund
[10] and boyajian and leslie [8], and later confirmed with
the identification of different ␣2 -adrenoceptor subtypes
in humans [31,34,39]. these receptors have distinct pattern in the nervous system: the ␣2a is widely distributed
throughout the nervous system and is localized both pre∗ corresponding author. tel.: +39-055-4271312;

and post-synaptically, with high levels in the cortex and in
the locus coeruleus; the ␣2b is dense in kidney, and mostly
localized to the thalamus in brain; the ␣2c is densest in
striatum, but has also been localized in cortex, on locus
coeruleus dendrites, and to a small degree on presynaptic
terminals in the peripheral nervous system [37].
one aspect of the ␣2 -adrenoceptor function receiving
increasing examination is its role in cognitive functions.
clonidine and other ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists have previously been shown to improve spatial working memory
in animals that have depleted levels of noradrenaline.
in monkeys, a 6-ohda lesion of the prefrontal cortex,
causing significant depletion of both noradrenaline and
dopamine, produced a profound impairment on the delayed alternation task [9] that was significantly improved
by clonidine administration [3]. aged monkeys, with naturally occurring cathecolamine depletion, are also improved
by ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonist treatment [26,38] as were animals with noradrenaline depletion produced by reserpine
[11] or mptp [44]. similarly, clonidine improved spatial
working memory in aged rats [45] as well as reversed
rat working memory deficits induced by the anxiogenic

drug fg7142 [6]. the clonidine-induced beneficial effect
was reversed by the ␣2 -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine [33] further suggesting a role of ␣2 -adrenoceptors
in ameliorating memory functions. evidence suggests that
␣2a -adrenoceptors are involved in cognitive enhancement
produced by ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists in aged monkeys [2].
recent literature on ␣2a -adrenoceptor mutant mice further
evidence the role of this receptor subtype in working memory performance and in cognitive enhancement produced
by ␣2a -adrenoceptor agonists [15]. in humans, clonidine
has been used clinically to treat disorders thought to involve
prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, such as mania [21], adhd
[25], and tourette’s syndrome [12]. clonidine has also been
shown to alleviate spatial working memory and attentional
set-shifting defect in parkinson’s disease patients [41], to
improve prefrontal cortex tasks in patients with korsakoff’s
syndrome [35], and schizophrenia [14].
in spite of the fact that there is a large consensus on
the ameliorative effect produced by ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists on memory functions, there are also some studies indicating the induction of a detrimental effect induced by the
above-mentioned compounds on cognitive processes. clonidine treatment provoked memory disturbances in rats in a
step-down [16,17] and shuttle-box [22,32] paradigms. recent humans studies showed that systemic administration
of clonidine disrupted memory accuracy in delayed matching to sample test in alzheimer’s disease patients [42] and
disrupted spatial working memory in healthy subjects [27].
the infusion of the ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists dexmedetomidine and clonidine impaired memory processes and reduced
performance on the digit symbol substitution test in healthy
young volunteers [19,20].
although most research has focused on the ameliorative effect of cognitive processes induced by activation of
␣2 -adrenoceptors, the induction of a detrimental effect on
memory function by ␣2 -agonists also deserve examination.
the aim of the present study was to further elucidate the
pharmacological profile of ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists in a
mouse passive avoidance paradigm in order to investigate
their potential amnesic effect in laboratory animals. in particular, our attention was focused on the identification of the
␣2 -adrenoceptor subtype involved by using selective pharmacological antagonists. since agonists of ␣2 -adrenoceptors
can induce numerous pharmacological effects such sedation
and hypotension [37], in order to exclude that the effects
produced by treatments were due to the induction of side
effects, some additional behavioral tests (rota-rod, animex
apparatus) were performed.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
four-week-old male swiss albino mice (23–25 g) from the
morini (san polo d’enza, italy) breeding farm were used.
fifteen mice were housed per cage (26 cm × 41 cm). the

cages were placed in the experimental room 24 h before the
test for acclimatization. the animals were fed a standard
laboratory diet and tap water ad libitum and kept at 23±1 ◦ c
with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, light on  xxxd2274xxx .00 a.m. the
same mice were not used for different behavioural tests. all
experiments were carried out in accordance with the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals as adopted and
promulgated by the national institutes of health.
2.2. passive avoidance test
the test was performed according to the step-through
method described by jarvik and kopp [28]. the apparatus
consisted of a two-compartment acrylic box with a lighted
compartment connected to a darkened one by a guillotine
door. as soon as the mouse entered the dark compartment,
it received a punishing electrical shock (0.5 ma, 1 s). the
latency time for entering the dark compartment were measured in the training test and after 24 h in the retention test.
the maximum entry latency allowed in the training and retention sessions was 60 and 180 s, respectively. the administration schedule of each drug used is reported in the figure
legends. between 11 and 25 mice per group were tested.
2.3. rota-rod test
the apparatus consisted of a base platform and a rotating
rod with a diameter of 3 cm and a non-slippery surface. the
rod was placed at a height of 15 cm from the base. the rod,
30 cm in length, was divided into five equal sections by
six disks. thus, up to five mice were tested simultaneously
on the apparatus, with a rod-rotating speed of 16 rpm. the
integrity of motor coordination was assessed on the basis
of the number of falls from the rod in 30 s according to
vaught et al. [49]. those mice scoring less than three and
more than six falls in the pretest were rejected (20%). the
performance time was measured before (pretest) and 15, 30,
and 45 min after the beginning of the test. clonidine and
 xxxd2241xxx  were administered 60 and 20 min, respectively,
before the test. twelve to fifteen mice per group were tested.
2.4. spontaneous activity meter (animex)
locomotor activity in mice was quantified using an animex activity meter type s (lkb, farad, sweden) set to
maximum sensitivity. every movement of mice, which were
placed on the top of the animex activity meter, produced a
signal due to variation in inductance and capacity of the apparatus resonance circuit. then signals were automatically
converted to numbers. on the day of the experiment the mice
were treated and then the cage, containing five mice, was
put on the measuring platform. activity counts were made
for 10 min starting 15 min after the beginning of the test. because of the arbitrary scale adopted to quantify movements,
drug-treated mice were always compared with saline-treated
ones. the test was performed 60 min after administration of

clonidine, yohimbine,  xxxd3000xxx , and arc-239, 20 min after
administration of  xxxd2241xxx  and 30 min after administration
of brl-44408. fifteen mice per group were tested.

be administered in a volume of 10 ml kg−1 by intraperitoneal injection.
2.6. statistical analysis
all experimental results are given as the mean ± s.e.m.

3. results
3.1. amnesic effect of  xxxg831xxx  -agonists
clonidine (0.125 mg kg−1 i.p.), administered 60 min before the training session, induced amnesia in the mouse
passive avoidance test. a reduction of the entrance latency
to the dark compartment was observed also when injected
20 min prior to the test, even if the statistical significance was
not reached. by contrast, when administered immediately
after the training session, no detrimental effect on mouse
memory processes was detected (fig. 1a). similarly,  xxxd2241xxx  (0.3 mg kg−1 i.p.) induced amnesia in the same experimental conditions. a statistically significant reduction of
the entrance latency was reached when administered 20 min
before or immediately after the training session, whereas,
when injected 90, 60, or 30 min before the first session of
the test it was completely ineffective (fig. 1a). the amnesia induced by both ␣2 -agonists was of the same intensity
of that produced by the well-known amnesic drug scopo-

lamine (1.5 mg kg−1 i.p.), used as the reference drug (fig. 1a
and b).
the amnesic effect of clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  was induced in a dose-dependent manner. the doses of clonidine
and  xxxd2241xxx  of 0.002 and 0.1 mg kg−1 , respectively,
i.p. were devoid of any effect. a statistically significant impairment of mnemonic functions was reached at
0.02 mg kg−1 i.p. (clonidine) and 0.2 mg kg−1 i.p. ( xxxd2241xxx ), whereas the maximum detrimental effect was obtained by administering the doses of 0.2 mg kg−1 i.p. (clonidine) and 0.3 mg kg−1 i.p. ( xxxd2241xxx ) (fig. 1b).
no difference among the entrance latencies of each group
in the training session of the passive avoidance test was
observed (fig. 1a and b).
3.2. prevention by yohimbine and brl-44408 of
 xxxg831xxx  -agonist-induced amnesia
the amnesia induced by clonidine (0.125 mg kg−1 i.p.)
and  xxxd2241xxx  (0.3 mg kg−1 i.p.) was dose-dependently

passive avoidance test. (b) lack of prevention by yohimbine of amnesia induced by scopolamine (1.5 mg kg−1 i.p.),  xxxd2550xxx  (20 mg kg−1 i.p.), and

 xxxd2550xxx , and baclofen were administered immediately after the training session. vertical lines represent s.e.m.; ∗ p < 0.05 in comparison with

prevented, in the mouse passive avoidance test, by i.p. pretreatment with the ␣2 -antagonist yohimbine. the dose
of 0.1 and 0.25 mg kg−1 were completely ineffective;
at 0.5 mg kg−1 yohimbine only reverted the guanabenzinduced amnesia, while the doses of 1 and 3 mg kg−1
enhanced the entrance latency in the retention session up
to a value comparable to that produced by control animals
(fig. 2a). the ␣2 -antagonist, at the dose of 3 mg kg−1 ,
did not modify the amnesia induced by the muscarinic
antagonist scopolamine (1.5 mg kg−1 i.p.), the nicotinic antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  (20 mg kg−1 i.p.), and the gabab
agonist baclofen (2 mg kg−1 i.p.), as illustrated in fig. 2b.
yohimbine, at the highest dose employed, did not produce
any effect in the mouse passive avoidance test in comparison with saline-treated mice when given alone (fig. 2a
and b).

the administration of the ␣2a,c -antagonist brl-44408
(0.3–1 mg kg−1 i.p.) antagonized the memory disruption
produced by both clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  without showing
any memory facilitating activity when given alone (fig. 3a).
similarly to yohimbine, brl-44408 (1 mg kg−1 i.p.) was
inactive in preventing amnesia induced by scopolamine,
 xxxd2550xxx , and baclofen (fig. 3b).
no difference between the entrance latencies of each
group in the training session of the passive avoidance test
was observed (figs. 2 and 3).
3.3. lack of effect by  xxxd3000xxx  and arc-239 of
 xxxg831xxx  -agonist-induced amnesia

(10 mg kg−1 i.p.), in contrast to the ␣2a,c -antagonist, was

at the dose of 1 mg kg−1 i.p., did not modify the entrance

groups (fig. 4).
3.4. effect of alpha-adrenoceptor modulators on mouse
behavior
the administration of the ␣-adrenoceptor modulators used
in the present investigation elicited their effect on cognitive

processes without changing animals’ gross behavior, spontaneous motility or motor coordination. the spontaneous
motility of mice, evaluated by means of the animex apparatus, was not modified by the above-mentioned treatments
administered at the highest active doses (fig. 5).
the rota-rod performance, evaluated as number of
falls in 30 s, of mice treated with clonidine at the doses
of 0.125 mg kg−1 i.p., and  xxxd2241xxx  at the doses of
0.30 mg kg−1 i.p., was not impaired in comparison with
saline-treated mice, indicating the lack of motor incoordination. on the contrary, clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  administered

(1 mg kg−1 i.p.),  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg kg−1 i.p.), and arc-239 (10 mg kg−1 i.p.), evaluated in the mouse animex apparatus. the test was performed 60 min
after administration of clonidine, yohimbine,  xxxd3000xxx , and arc-239, 30 min after administration of brl-44408 and 20 min after administration of

at higher doses (0.50 and 1.0 mg kg−1 i.p., respectively),
produced a significant impairment of the rota-rod performance by increasing the number of falls from the rotating

4. discussion
the current study examined the effects exerted by activation of ␣2 -adrenoceptors on memory processes. to this
purpose two chemically diverse ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists,
the imidazoline derivative clonidine and the guanidine
derivative  xxxd2241xxx , were investigated. the results showed
that systemic administration of clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx 
induced a dose-dependent amnesia in a mouse passive
avoidance paradigm of intensity comparable to that exerted
by scopolamine, used as reference amnesic drug. various
observations described a detrimental effect on memory processes induced by clonidine in mice [23], rats [17,22,32],
and humans [20,27,42]. data reported in the present study
confirm and extend the above-mentioned literature reports,
further supporting the hypothesis of a negative role for
␣2 -adrenoceptors in the modulation of cognitive function.
the impairment of memory processes induced by the
investigated ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists is time-dependent.
time–course experiments indicated that clonidine-induced
amnesia was detectable when the compound was administered 60 min before the training session of the test. similarly,  xxxd2241xxx  exerted its detrimental effect when admin-

415

istered 20 min before or immediately after the first session
of the passive avoidance test. at all other administration
times, clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  were unable to modify
the entrance latency values in comparison with the control
group. in our experimental conditions, an amelioration of
memory processes induced by clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx 
was never observed at any administration time. however, it
should be taken into account that an improvement in cognition of animals that have no memory impairment is difficult
to demonstrate in the passive avoidance test. as a matter of fact, well-known nootropic drugs such as piracetam
and  xxxd181xxx  or cholinomimetics such as physostigmine
and oxotremorine, do not show any memory facilitation in
unamnesic animals [13,18].
the ␣2 -antagonist yohimbine reversed the impairment
of memory function induced by clonidine and guananbenz,
a profile consistent with ␣2 -adrenoceptors contributing to
amnesia. ␣2 -adrenoceptors are divided into several subtypes: ␣2a , ␣2b , and ␣2c [37]. the ␣2a -subtype is the key
␣2 -adrenoceptor involved in numerous effects produced by
␣2 -adrenoceptor activation, such as modulation of nociception, cardiovascular function, sedation, lipid metabolism,
and release of noradrenaline [29]. the involvement of this
receptor subtype in the mechanism of amnesic action of
clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  was, therefore, investigated. the
administration of the ␣2a -adrenoceptor antagonist, brl44408 [40], prevented the amnesia induced by clonidine and
 xxxd2241xxx , consistent with actions at ␣2a -adrenoceptors.
the ␣2 -antagonists used selectively prevented the amnesia
induced by ␣2 -agonists since neither yohimbine nor brl44408 were able to reverse the memory impairment induced
by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, the nicotinic antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  or the gabab agonist baclofen at
the highest dose effective against clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx 
amnesia. we can, therefore, exclude any unselective effect
not related to a ␣2 -adrenoceptor blockade.
overexpression of ␣2c -adrenoceptors impaired navigation in the mouse morris water maze task [7] suggesting
an involvement of the ␣2c -adrenoceptor subtype in the
modulation of memory function. the anatomical distribution of ␣2c -adrenoceptors (i.e. prefrontal cortex, striatum)
suggests their involvement in mediating the effects of ␣2 adenoceptors agonists on working memory [1,36]. in our
experimental conditions, the ␣2b,c -adrenoceptor antagonists arc-239 and  xxxd3000xxx  [47] were unable to prevent
the amnesia induced by clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  indicating
that the adreneceptor subtype responsible for the induction
of memory impairment by the ␣2 -agonists in a passive
avoidance paradigm does not belong to the ␣2b and ␣2c subtypes. similar results have been obtained investigating the
␣2 -adrenoceptor subtype involved in the memory enhancing properties of ␣2 -adrenoceptor agonists. experiments
performed with mice with inactivation of the ␣2c -receptor
gene indicate that the beneficial effect of ␣2 -adrenoceptor
agonists on spatial working memory is not mediated via
␣2c -adrenoceptor subtype [46].

the involvement of ␣1 -adrenoceptors in the modulation
of mnemonic functions has also been postulated. systemic administration of the imidazoline/␣1 -adrenoceptor
agonist  xxxd1707xxx  impaired delayed response performance
in aged monkeys [4]. furthermore, local infusion of the
␣1 -adrenoceptor agonists directly into the prefrontal cortex in rats impaired performance on a delayed alternation
task [5].  xxxd3000xxx  is not only a ␣2b,c -adrenoceptor antagonist, but it is also a ␣1 -adrenoceptor antagonist. the
inability of  xxxd3000xxx  to reverse the detrimental effect induced by clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  indicates that not even
␣1 -adrenoceptors are involved in the mechanism of amnesic
action of the two investigated compounds.
clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  belong to two different chemical classes. since both compounds showed a similar pharmacological profile, we can exclude that the induction of
amnesia is related to the particular chemical structure of
each molecule. it is plausible to suppose that the memory
impairment produced by the above-mentioned compounds
is dependent to their capability to activate ␣2 -adrenoceptors.
agonists of ␣2 -adrenoceptors induce numerous pharmacological effects, such as sedation and hypotension [37],
whose appearance could lead to an alteration of the results
obtained. it has been, therefore, necessary to choose a range
of doses of clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  at which these compounds showed amnesic properties without any behavioral
side effect. clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx , at the highest doses
used, did not impair motor coordination as revealed by the
rota-rod test, and did not modify spontaneous motility as indicated by the animex apparatus. the observation that, in
the first session of the passive avoidance test, the latency
to enter the dark compartment of the light–dark box was
not modified by the administration of clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  further confirms the absence of behavioral side effects. higher doses of clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  were not
used because they impaired the mouse rota-rod performance.
all other ␣2 -adrenoceptor modulators used were administered at doses that did not modify the animals’ spontaneous
motility.
in conclusion, our results evidence that the activation of
the ␣2a -adrenoceptor subtype is a requirement for the induction of amnesia by clonidine and  xxxd2241xxx  in the mouse
passive avoidance test. contemporary, the lack of involvement of ␣2b and ␣2c subtypes has been observed.
