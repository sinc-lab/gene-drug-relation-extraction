abstract
background
heavy menstrual bleeding (hmb) is an important cause of ill health in pre menopausal women. medical therapy, with the avoidance
of possibly unnecessary surgery is an attractive treatment option, but there is considerable variation in practice and uncertainty about
the most effective therapy.  xxxd1806xxx  is a synthetic steroid with anti-oestrogenic and anti progestogenic activity, and weak androgenic
properties.  xxxd1806xxx  suppresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium, leading to endometrial atrophy (thinning of
the lining of the uterus) and reduced menstrual loss and to amenorrhoea in some women.
objectives
to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of  xxxd1806xxx  when used for heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive years.
search methods
we searched the menstrual disorders and subfertility group’s specialised register (april 2007). we also searched the cochrane
controlled trials register (cochrane library, issue 2, 2007), medline (1966 to april 2007), embase (1980 to april 2007,
cinahl (1982 to april 2007). attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of included trials and relevant review
articles.
selection criteria
randomised controlled trials of  xxxd1806xxx  versus placebo, any other medical (non-surgical) therapy or  xxxd1806xxx  in different dosages for
heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive age with regular hmb measured either subjectively or objectively. trials that
included women with post menopausal bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding and pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were
excluded.
data collection and analysis
nine rcts, with 353 women, were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. quality assessment and data extraction were performed
independently by two reviewers. the main outcomes were menstrual blood loss, the number of women experiencing adverse effects,
weight gain, withdrawals due to adverse effects and dysmenorrhoea. if data could not be extracted in a form suitable for meta-analysis,
they were presented in a descriptive format.

main results
most data were not in a form suitable for meta analysis, and the results are based on a small number of trials, all of which are underpowered.  xxxd1806xxx  appears to be more effective than placebo, progestogens, nsaids and the ocp at reducing mbl, but confidence
intervals were wide. treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  caused more adverse events than nsaids (or 7.0; 95% ci 1.7 to 28.2) and progestogens
(or 4.05, 95% ci 1.6 to10.2).  xxxd1806xxx  was shown to significantly lower the duration of menses when compared with nsaids
(wmd -1.0; 95% ci -1.8 to -0.3) and a progesterone releasing iud (wmd -6.0; 95% ci -7.3 to -4.8). there were no randomised
trials comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd3410xxx  or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.
authors’ conclusions
 xxxd1806xxx  appears to be an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding compared to other medical treatments. the use of  xxxd1806xxx 
may be limited by its side effect profile, its acceptability to women and the need for continuing treatment. the small number of trials,
and the small sample sizes of the included trials limit the recommendations for clinical care. further studies are unlikely in the future
and this review will not be updated unless further studies are identified.

plain language summary
 xxxd1806xxx  is an effective treatment for the reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding, but the adverse effects may be unacceptable to
women
options to help avoid surgery can be important for many women who are having problems with heavy menstrual bleeding. one of the
drug options is  xxxd1806xxx .  xxxd1806xxx  suppresses the hormones that increase the endometrium (the lining of the uterus that is shed during
menstruation). however,  xxxd1806xxx  can also produce male characteristics and some menopause-like symptoms, as well as weight gain
and acne. the review found that although  xxxd1806xxx  is effective at reducing menstrual blood loss there are not enough trials to show
whether this treatment is acceptable to women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

background
heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) can have a significant
impact on women’s lives. in the uk, one in 20 women aged 30
to 49 consult their general practitioner each year with heavy menstrual bleeding (vessey 1992) and it accounts for 12% of all gynaecological referrals (bradlow 1992). once referred to a gynaecologist, surgical intervention is highly likely (coulter 1991).
heavy menstrual bleeding (hmb) or menorrhagia is clinically
defined as greater than or equal to 80 ml blood loss per menstrual
cycle (hallberg 1966; cole 1971). it is, however, the woman’s
perception of her own menstrual loss which is the key determinant
in a referral and, indeed, subsequent treatment. the main aim of
the treatment of menorrhagia is to reduce blood loss in order to
improve quality of life and prevent anaemia.
many factors can cause hmb for example coagulation disorders,
endocrine disorders, uterine abnormalities and other pelvic pathology. these disorders should be excluded before decisions are made
about treatment as they may require different management. however, in most cases, there is no pathological cause of the heavy

bleeding, and the condition is labelled dysfunctional uterine bleeding (ehcb 1995). eighty percent of women treated for menorrhagia have no uterine abnormality and over a third of the women
undergoing hysterectomies for hmb have a normal uterus removed (gath 1982; clarke 1995). although patient satisfaction
with hysterectomies is high (coulter 1994), there are complications and occasional death associated with hysterectomy (dicker
1982). complications are more likely when the hysterectomy is
performed by the open abdominal route, as is usually the case
(hospital 1995). effective medical therapy, that avoids unnecessary surgery, is therefore an attractive alternative.
a wide variety of medications are available to reduce hmb but
their effectiveness has been questioned (coulter 1995). the aim
of this review is to see if  xxxd1806xxx  is an effective therapy for hmb.
 xxxd1806xxx  is chemically derived from testosterone (a naturally occurring hormone). it inhibits ovulation and reduces oestrogen levels. it also causes endometrial atrophy (thinning of the lining of
the uterus), reduced menstrual loss and leads to amenorrhoea (absence of periods) in some women (chimbira 1980b).  xxxd1806xxx  has

a dramatic effect on increasing haemoglobin and serum ferritin
levels and may therefore be valuable in women who need effective
therapy to stop very heavy bleeding and restore their haemoglobin
and iron status to normal (ford 1994; chimbira 1979).  xxxd1806xxx 
has androgenic properties (a tendency to cause male characteristics) which may result in acne, seborrhoea (greasy skin) and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). other side effects include weight
gain, irritability, musculoskeletal pains, hot flushes and breast atrophy (loss of breast tissue). longer term treatment with  xxxd1806xxx 
may cause liver effects (including benign hepatic adenomas) in
some women.

searching other resources
citation lists of included trials and relevant review articles were
also searched. for most of the included trials (cameron 1987;
chimbira 1980a; higham 1993; lamb 1987; fraser 1991), the
first author was contacted to clarify issues related to data extraction.

data collection and analysis
the review was undertaken by four reviewers (hb, al, kd and
ca), two of whom (kd, hb) have clinical expertise and one of
whom has specific statistical expertise (al).
selection of trials for inclusion in the review was performed by the
reviewers after employing the search strategy described previously.
included trials were analysed for the following quality criteria and
methodological details:
trial characteristics
1. method of randomisation
2. presence or absence of blinding to treatment allocation
3. quality of allocation concealment
4. number of women randomised, excluded or lost to follow up
5. whether an intention to treat analysis was done
6. whether a power calculation was performed
7. duration, timing and location of the study
8. source of funding of the study
characteristics of the study women
1. age and any other recorded characteristics of women in the
study
2. other inclusion criteria
3. exclusion criteria
interventions used
1. types of medical therapy used
2. dose, duration and timing of administration of medical therapy
outcomes
1. methods used to measure menstrual blood loss after treatment
2. methods used to evaluate adverse effects
3. methods used to measure symptoms of dysmenorrhoea
4. methods used to assess duration of menses
5. methods used to evaluate efficacy of intervention
6. methods used to assess acceptability of intervention
7. methods used to assess quality of life measures
8. methods used to measure time to relapse
all assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were
performed independently by two reviewers (hb and al) using
forms designed according to cochrane guidelines. discrepancies
were resolved by discussion.
one of the included trials was published in turkish (buyru 1995).
the methods, results and any associated tables or figures for this
study were translated by metin gulmezoglu of the cochrane collaboration. additional information was sought from the principal
investigators of trials in which the methodology and/or original

trial data was inadequately reported in the publication. letters
were sent to the authors of five of the included trials (cameron
1987;chimbira 1980a;fraser 1991;higham 1993;lamb 1987) to
request additional information. replies were received from dr
is fraser, from the fraser 1991 study, and j higham from the
higham 1993 study, who both supplied individual participant
data. a reply was also received from i cameron of the cameron
1987 study, who was unable to supply any additional information.
replies were not received for the other studies.
one of the included studies was of a cross-over design (fraser
1991). for each treatment, data from both arms of the cross-over
were combined in the publication. it may not be valid to include
the results after the cross-over because of potential carryover effects, and only data from before the cross-over were used in this
review. individual participant data were obtained from the principal author and the reviewers calculated means with their standard
deviations for phase one data.
allocation concealment was scored according to the categories
used by the cochrane collaboration; allocation concealment was
adequate (a), unclear (b), inadequate (c), or that allocation concealment was not used (d). other aspects reported in the methodological quality section of the review are; method of randomisation, use of blinding, use of intention to treat analysis, baseline
similarity of comparison groups, numbers lost to follow up and
trial design and power. details of any other important methodological issues are reported in the table of characteristics of included studies.
three of the studies reported the number of pads used per day
as one of the subjective measures of mbl. this outcome was not
included in this review as it may be an inaccurate measure of mbl.
there is no correlation between blood loss and the number of pads
or tampons used (fraser 1984; chimbira 1980c). sanitary pad
usage is based more on habit, convenience and individual personal
hygiene than quantity of blood (chimbira 1980c).
quality of life measures were not assessed in a generic validated
score in any of the trials. however, dysmenorrhoea was assessed
by two authors and this outcome was added to the protocol. both
authors used a simple three point scoring system (where 1= mild
pain and 3= severe pain). one author recorded scores for backache
and abdominal pain (bonduelle 1991) and the other recorded a
score for dysmenorrhoea (dockeray 1989).
statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis described in the cochrane handbook.
where possible, the outcomes were pooled statistically. for dichotomous data (for example proportion of women experiencing
side effects), results for each study were expressed as an odds ratio
with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta analysis
with rev man software using the fixed effects mantel-haenszel
model, unless there was significant heterogeneity in which case a
random effects der simonian and laird model was used. continuous data were shown as a weighted mean difference (wmd) and
95% confidence interval. heterogeneity between the results was

examined by inspecting the scatter in the data plots and the overlap in their confidence intervals and more formally by checking
the results of the chi-squared tests. however, as some outcomes
contained only one trial, it was not appropriate to look at heterogeneity for all outcomes.
difficulties were encountered with the reporting of continuous
outcomes. meta-analysis with the rev man software offers a
wmd option to combine outcomes and requires data to be presented as absolute values of means with their standard deviations.
for many outcomes, particularly menstrual blood loss, the data are
skewed and authors correctly presented their data as medians with
a range. where possible original data were obtained from the principal authors in order to calculate means with their standard deviations. this was done for one study (higham 1993). where only
medians and ranges were available, as in the cameron study, the
data were inspected for skew ness. if the distribution appeared to
be skewed (median towards one end of the range), the results were
reported in the other data section of the review. if there did not
appear to be significant skew ness, the median was taken as being
the mean and an estimate of the standard deviation was roughly
calculated from the range ((range x 0.95)/4). for the cameron
study, means and standard deviations were estimated from the data
for duration of menses, but the data for mbl (which showed skew
ness) were reported in the other data section.
for one study, standard errors were reported. these were converted
to standard deviations (standard error x square root of n (where
n= group size)) for the outcome of menstrual blood loss so that a
wmd could be calculated (chimbira 1980a).
when the mean was reported, but there was evidence of highly
significant skew ness (mean/sd<1), the results were reported in
the other data section of the review. analyses based on means
are only appropriate where the data is approximately normally
distributed. a mean to standard deviation ratio of less than one
indicates distinct evidence of a skewed distribution (altman 1996)
and it is not appropriate to use this data in a meta-analysis. the
mbl data for three studies (chimbira 1980a; dunphy 1998;
fraser 1991) was reported in the other data section for this reason.
where data could not be extracted in a form suitable for inclusion
in the meta-analysis, for example where figures were inadequately
reported in the publication, the data were reported in the other
data tables.
a priori it was planned to perform sensitivity analyses on results
to assess the possible contribution of:
-differences in adequacy of allocation concealment, clear concealment only compared to uncertain or inadequate concealment
-differences in methodological quality; trials of high quality only
compared to all other trials
-differences in methods of defining menorrhagia and assessing
menstrual blood loss, use of objectively determined (alkaline
haematin method) menorrhagia compared to other methods
however, such analyses were not possible as the number of studies
included in the review was inadequate.

it is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for rcts will
be carried out annually and the review updated accordingly.

description of studies
see: characteristics of included studies; characteristics of excluded
studies.
eleven rcts (reported in ten publications) comparing  xxxd1806xxx 
with either placebo, other medical treatments or other doses of
 xxxd1806xxx  in women with heavy menstrual bleeding were identified.
studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with surgical treatments and studies
comparing the effectiveness of various medical treatments as preoperative agents for menorrhagia were excluded from this review.
trials excluded from this review
two trials were excluded from the review. one of them (need
1992) was a study of 11 women with subjective and objective heavy
menstrual bleeding who all received 200 mg  xxxd1806xxx  per day for
one month. the women were then split into four groups and given
either  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day,  xxxd1806xxx  100 mg/day,  xxxd1806xxx  50 mg/
day or placebo. there was concern that there was not a sufficient
washout period between the induction and treatment phases of
the trial. in addition the numbers randomised to each of the four
arms of the trial were very small (only 2-3 women per arm), so
that after withdrawals from the study some of the results became
meaningless. the data from the initial induction phase of this trial
could not be used as there was no control group- all the women
received  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day. one publication reported on two
trials, and one of these (chimbira 1980b) was excluded from the
review. it was a before-after treatment study of eight women- each
participant took placebo followed by  xxxd1806xxx  (the order the same
for all women). this is likely to cause bias as there is no controlling
for the time effect.
trials included from this review
nine rcts met the inclusion criteria for this review. one trial
compared  xxxd1806xxx  with placebo (lamb 1987), seven compared
 xxxd1806xxx  with other medical therapies (bonduelle 1991; buyru
1995; cameron 1987; dockeray 1989; dunphy 1998; fraser
1991; higham 1993) and one study compared different doses of
 xxxd1806xxx  (chimbira 1980a). unpublished data were obtained for
two of these trials to obtain separate figures for the group who
had received  xxxd1806xxx  before cross-over (fraser 1991) and to try
to obtain individual participant data for blood loss measurements
(higham 1993). the authors of two other studies (chimbira
1980a; lamb 1987) were contacted for additional data, but further

the locations of the included studies were as follows: uk (five
studies), ireland, australia, turkey and canada (one study for
each). the review is based on studies that included a total of 353
women. the study women in the nine trials were pre menopausal
women aged from 18 to 50 years, and all had a subjective complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding. five of the studies required the
women to have objectively determined (by the alkaline haematin
method) heavy menstrual bleeding. however, the cut off point
for this varied between trials. one study defined heavy mbl as
greater than 50 ml per cycle (cameron 1987), one used >60 ml
per cycle, as the cut off point (chimbira 1980a) and three studies defined heavy mbl as greater than or equal to 80 ml/cycle
(dockeray 1989; dunphy 1998; higham 1993). in all of these
studies women were randomised after the mean menstrual blood
loss had been confirmed as meeting the criteria for the particular
study. for one of these studies, mbl was measured for one month
prior to starting treatment (dunphy 1998). in the other four studies requiring women to have objectively determined hmb, mbl
was measured for two months prior to starting treatment.
most of the studies required the women to have regular (21 to 35
days cycle) menses, but the higham trial included both ovulatory
and anovulatory women. pelvic pathology was an exclusion criteria
in eight studies. other exclusion criteria included pregnancy (two
studies), hormone or anticoagulant treatment (two studies) and
iud use (two studies).
interventions
the duration of treatment was two cycles in three studies
(cameron 1987; dockeray 1989; fraser 1991) and three cycles in
the other six studies. four of the included studies also had a three
month follow up period after treatment was stopped (chimbira
1980a; dunphy 1998; higham 1993; lamb 1987).
chimbira 1980a compared two different dosages of  xxxd1806xxx ; 100
mg/ day and 200 mg/day. all the other studies (bonduelle 1991;
buyru 1995; cameron 1987; dockeray 1989; dunphy 1998;
fraser 1991; higham 1993; lamb 1987) used  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/
day. in one of these studies (dockeray 1989)  xxxd1806xxx  was given
twice daily as two 100 mg doses. in all the other studies 200 mg
 xxxd1806xxx  was given once daily.  xxxd1806xxx  was given from day five of
the cycle in one study (fraser 1991), or throughout the cycle from
the start of the menses, in all other studies.
five studies compared  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen. one of these
(dunphy 1998) compared  xxxd1806xxx  with medroxyprogesterone,
(10 mg on days 16-25 of the cycle), the other four compared  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2751xxx  (bonduelle 1991; buyru 1995; cameron
1987; higham 1993). in two of these studies,  xxxd2751xxx  was
given as a dose of 5 mg three times daily on days 19-26 of the
cycle (bonduelle 1991; higham 1993), and in the other two, it
was given as 5 mg twice daily on days 15-25 of the cycle (cameron
1987) and on days 16-25 of the cycle (buyru 1995). in one of
these studies (dunphy 1998) women were given placebo for the
other days of the cycle to ensure blinding.

in three trials  xxxd1806xxx  was compared with a nsaid. three studies compared  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2556xxx  acid (cameron 1987;
dockeray 1989 and fraser 1991) and the fraser study also compared  xxxd1806xxx  with naproxen. where the comparison intervention was  xxxd2556xxx  acid, this was given in a dose of 500 mg three
times daily for a maximum of five days per cycle. naproxen, was
given as an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg three to
four times daily for a maximum of five days.
one study (fraser 1991) compared  xxxd1806xxx  with a low dose
oral contraceptive pill (ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx  30ug and levonorgestrel
150ug) for 21 out of every 28 days. in one study (cameron 1987),
one of the comparison interventions was a progesterone impregnated coil releasing 65ug progesterone daily.
outcomes
for all of the trials mbl was a main outcome measure. in five trials menstrual blood loss was objectively measured by the alkaline
haematin method (cameron 1987; chimbira 1980a; dockeray
1989; fraser 1991; higham 1993). in the remaining four trials
mbl was measured subjectively. the dunphy study assessed mbl
by using the pictorial chart method described by higham (1990).
in this study blood loss was recorded each month by women using the chart method and the total blood loss each month was
recorded. the bonduelle study used a scoring system, where heaviness of bleeding was rated on a scale and scored for each day of
bleeding from 1 to 7 (where 1=spotting and 7= flooding). the
daily values were combined to yield a menstrual bleeding intensity
score for each period. three studies assessed mbl by the number
of pads used per day (bonduelle 1991; buyru 1995; lamb 1987).
this outcome was not included in the analysis, as it is an inaccurate
measure of mbl. the mbl data in the lamb (1987) trial could
not be extracted as the paper gave no details on the type of score
used or the information used to obtain a score. the author of this
trial was contacted for further details, but no reply was received.
two studies (bonduelle 1991; higham 1993) assessed the efficacy
of treatment. both assessed this subjectively, and the higham study
also assessed this objectively (the number of women with mbl <80
ml/cycle (measured by the alkaline haematin method) at the end of
the intervention was reported). three studies reported mbl after
discontinuation of treatment. dunphy 1998 and chimbira 1980a
measured mbl for three months after the intervention. the data
from the chimbira study could not be included in the analysis as
the figures for one of the intervention groups were not reported.
the higham trial reported the recurrence rates of menorrhagia
of the three groups during the placebo follow up phase. however
this could not be included in the analysis as those who continued
in the follow up phase were only a small subset of all the original
women, and the numbers entering this stage of the trial were so
small that some of the results were meaningless.
seven studies reported on the effects of treatment on the duration of menses (bonduelle 1991; buyru 1995; cameron 1987;
chimbira 1980a; dockeray 1989; higham 1993; lamb 1987).

bonduelle (1991), chimbira (1980a) and dockeray (1989) reported the effects on dysmenorrhoea as one of the outcome measures. the bonduelle (1991) trial used a scoring system for backache and abdominal pain and the other two studies assessed the
numbers reporting an improvement in dysmenorrhoea.
side effects were reported in a number of ways. some studies
reported numbers of women experiencing any adverse events,
whereas others reported on specific adverse events (such as weight
gain, hirsutism, nausea). six studies reported on the total number of women experiencing any side effects from the treatment.
five studies looked at the number of women experiencing specific
adverse events (buyru 1995; chimbira 1980a; dockeray 1989;
higham 1993; lamb 1987). however the results of these could
not be included in the meta-analysis, as they were reported as frequency of events (rather than the number of women experiencing a particular side effect). four trials (bonduelle 1991; buyru
1995; dunphy 1998; higham 1993) reported the number of withdrawals due to side effects and dockeray (1989) assessed treatment
acceptability.
five studies assessed weight gain as one of the outcome measures.
the way in which this was reported varied between trials. the trials
by chimbira (1980a) and dunphy (1998) looked at the mean
weight gain for the different treatment groups. two studies assessed
the number of women with weight gain over a certain value. the
higham (1993) study reported on the number of women with
a weight gain of less than3kg and the bonduelle (1991) study
reported the number of women with weight gain of less than 2kg.
lamb (1987) compared the mean weight of the two groups after
treatment.

risk of bias in included studies
see table 1
randomisation and allocation concealment
allocation to an intervention group was randomised in all of the
included trials. all included studies were given an allocation score
of b due to unclear details regarding the method of allocation
and allocation concealment. in six trials, the authors stated that
women were allocated at random to one of the interventions, but
gave no further details. higham (1993) described randomisation
as “patients were allocated to the treatments in strict sequential
order. patients were stratified across treatment groups according to
whether they were ovulatory or anovulatory and by their mean objectively measured menstrual loss during baseline”. in the dockeray (1989) trial, women were assigned to one of the two treatments according to a prepared randomisation code, but no other
details were given. dunphy (1988) also reported randomised allocation according to a random code.
blinding
blinding was uncertain in three of the studies (buyru 1995;
chimbira 1980a; fraser 1991). in the cameron (1987) study, nei-

ther the treatment providers nor the women were blinded, as the
study compared three medical treatments and a progesterone releasing intrauterine device, but it is unclear as to whether the outcome assessors were blinded. two of the studies (dunphy 1998
and lamb 1987) were reported as being double blind and two were
open studies with no blinding (bonduelle 1991; dockeray 1989).
two studies (fraser 1991; higham 1993) were single blind. in the
fraser (1991) study the laboratory staff who performed the mbl
assays were blinded, but the treatment providers and women were
not blinded. the higham (1993) study was a single blind study,
with the women not blind to the intervention.
withdrawals , dropouts and intention to treat anaylsis
withdrawal rates from randomisation to the end of the treatment phase ranged from 0 to 47% (14 out of the 30 randomised)
in bonduelle 1991. there were no reported drop outs or exclusions post randomisation in buyru 1995 and cameron 1987.
in chimbira 1980a it was unclear whether there were any withdrawals. withdrawals after randomisation and prior to treatment
included 20% (6 out of 30) in bonduelle 1991, 9% (2 out of 23) in
dunphy 1998 and 5% (3 out of 57) in higham 1993. drop outs
during the treatment phase were as follows: bonduelle 1991, 27%
(8 out of the 30 randomised); higham 1993, 18% (10 of the 57
randomised); fraser 1991, 16% (7 out of 45); dunphy 1998, 13%
(3 out of 23) and 3% (1 out of 40) in dockeray 1989. lamb 1987
reported 10 withdrawals out of 76 women (13%) between randomisation and the end of the first month of treatment. reasons
for withdrawal were usually due to side effects of treatment, unwillingness to continue, non-compliance or failure to meet some
inclusion criteria. in the higham (1993) study, three women were
excluded prior to treatment, two were excluded due to a pharmacy
dispensing error and one due to menopausal symptoms.
higham 1993 reported that an intention to treat analysis was performed, however three women who withdrew after randomisation
were excluded from the intention to treat analysis. an intention
to treat analysis was performed by default in two studies (buyru
1995; cameron 1987) where there were no reported withdrawals.
baseline similarity of comparison groups
one study presented no information on the baseline similarity
of the comparison groups (chimbira 1980a). dunphy 1998 and
fraser 1991 only presented data on pretreatment menstrual blood
loss, and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups on this measure. higham 1993 presented data on
age, weight, duration of menses, cycle length, haemoglobin concentration and pretreatment menstrual blood loss. there was no
significant difference between the three treatment groups on any
of these measures. in the dockeray 1989 study, the two groups
did not significantly differ in terms of age, height, parity, menstrual blood loss measurements and numbers with dysmenorrhoea.
buyru 1995 reported no significant differences between the two

groups in terms of age, weight, baseline haemoglobin and duration
of menses.
in three trials (bonduelle 1991; cameron 1987; lamb 1987) there
were imbalances between the  xxxd1806xxx  and comparison groups
in potentially important baseline factors. in the cameron 1987
study, the groups differed in terms of mbl at baseline, which was
significantly higher in the  xxxd1806xxx  group. there were however,
no differences between the four groups in terms of age, height,
weight, parity and duration of menses. bonduelle 1991 presented
data on age, gravidity, duration of menorrhagia, bleeding scores,
backache scores and abdominal pain scores. abdominal pain scores
were significantly higher in the  xxxd1806xxx  group, but the two groups
were comparable on the other measures. lamb 1987 reported no
differences between the two groups in terms of weight, age, weight,
blood pressure, parity and duration of symptoms. however there
were differences between the groups for blood loss scores, with the
 xxxd1806xxx  group having higher blood loss scores.
trial design
fraser 1991 is a cross-over study. this trial did not have a sufficient
washout period before women were crossed over to another treatment, and only the data from the first arm of the cross-over were
used in this review. it is not valid to include the results from after
the cross-over because of potential bias from carryover effects. the
other eight trials were parallel in design (bonduelle 1991; buyru
1995; cameron 1987; chimbira 1980a; dockeray 1989; dunphy
1998; higham 1993; lamb 1987).
trial size and power caluculation
a statistical power calculation was included in the method of the
dunphy trial. the authors reported that 34 women would be
needed for the study to have sufficient power. however the authors
were only able to recruit 23 women, and only 18 of these women
were included in the analysis.
source of funding
for six of the included studies, the source of funding was a pharmaceutical company. one study was funded by a birthright research grant, and two studies did not state any source of funding.

effects of interventions
overall nine studies compared the use of  xxxd1806xxx  with placebo,
other medical treatments or different doses of  xxxd1806xxx  for the
treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. the studies contained a
total of 353 women.
 xxxd1806xxx  versus placebo
one study with 66 women compared  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg once daily
with a matched placebo once daily for three months of treatment
(lamb 1987).
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)

this study did not assess objective mbl, and subjective mbl was
assessed using an unidentified scoring system. it was not possible
to include data for the menstrual blood loss scores, as the type
of scoring system used and the figures were poorly reported in
the paper. the authors report no significant differences in blood
loss scores for the placebo group when comparing before and after
treatment scores. a significant difference in blood loss scores was
reported for the  xxxd1806xxx  group compared to the pre-treatment
scores, but it is unclear how this was calculated.
duration of menses
the data for duration of menses could not be included in this
review as the figures were inadequately reported in the paper. the
author reported no difference in duration of menses for the placebo
group comparing pre and post treatment figures. a significant
difference in duration of menses was reported for the  xxxd1806xxx 
group (when comparing before and after treatment figures), but
the authors do not indicate how this was calculated.
withdrawals due to side effects
the number of withdrawals due to side effects during the intervention did not significantly differ between the two groups (or
2.06, 95% ci 0.18, 23.94).
body weight
the trial reported data on the mean body weight for each group.
after three months treatment the mean weight (kg) of the  xxxd1806xxx 
group was significantly greater than that of the placebo group
(wmd 6.70, 95% ci 0.98, 12.42).
 xxxd1806xxx  versus progestogens
five of the included studies involving a total of 131 women compared 200 mg  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen. for four of the studies
the comparison intervention was  xxxd2751xxx , and in one study
the progestogen was  xxxd2554xxx .
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)
four of the studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen reported data on mbl. in two trials mbl was measured objectively using the alkaline haematin method. one small parallel trial
comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2751xxx  in the meta analysis (n=
37) showed no significant difference between the two groups for
menstrual blood loss after treatment (wmd -35.60 , 95% ci 102.20 to 31.00) (higham 1993). the other trial reporting objectively measured mbl, contained data which was not reported in a
form suitable for pooling. this trial reported mbl as medians and
ranges, rather than means and standard deviations and is included
as descriptive data in the other data section (cameron 1987). in
this trial the groups were not comparable at baseline, and the study
compared mbl after treatment to mbl at baseline for the different treatment groups. there was no significant difference between
the before and after treatment values for the progestogen group
(p>0.05), where as mbl after treatment was significantly lower
than that at baseline for the  xxxd1806xxx  group (p<0.05) (cameron
1987).
two studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen reported sub-

jective measures of mbl. both are included as descriptive data
in the other data section due to skewing of the data in one
(dunphy 1998) and use of a non-standard bleeding scale in the
other (bonduelle 1991). one trial used the pictorial chart method
described by higham (1990) to record monthly blood loss and
reported that mbl after three months treatment was significantly
lower in the  xxxd1806xxx  group compared to the medroxyprogesterone
acetate group (p=0.0128) (dunphy 1998). the other study used a
seven point scoring system where daily bleeding scores were combined to give a score for each menstrual period. the trial compared bleeding scores after three months treatment and showed a
significant difference between the two groups in favour of  xxxd1806xxx 
(p<0.05).
one study (n=18) included the outcome of mbl three months
after the intervention. the trial showed that mbl (assessed by the
pictorial chart method) was significantly lower in the progestogen
group three months after treatment was stopped (wmd 203.00,
95%ci 25.65 to 380.35) (dunphy 1998).
side effects
four trials reported the number of women in each of the two
treatment groups experiencing side effects. the four studies in
the meta analysis showed that significantly more women in the
 xxxd1806xxx  group experienced side effects compared to the progestogen group (or 4.05, 95% ci 1.61 to 10.21) (bonduelle 1991;
buyru 1995; dunphy 1998; higham 1993). commonly reported
side effects for  xxxd1806xxx  treatment included acne, weight gain,
headache, nausea and tiredness. one study found that adverse effects were reported with a similar frequency and were of a similar
nature in both treatment groups (bonduelle 1991). commonly
reported side effects in this study were weight gain, bloating, gastro-intestinal symptoms, skin changes, lethargy, depression and reduced concentration. buyru 1995 found that headaches and muscle cramps were reported with similar frequency in both groups,
but the  xxxd1806xxx  group also complained of weight gain, acne, nausea and intermenstrual bleeding. the higham (1993) study found
that both groups reported the adverse effects of muscle cramps
and depression with similar frequency. in this study, other commonly reported side effects amongst the  xxxd1806xxx  group included
headache, weight gain, nausea and vomiting and acne, where as
other adverse effects reported amongst the progestogen group were
premenstrual tension symptoms (higham 1993).
withdrawals due to side effects
four trials comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen reported the
number of withdrawals due to side effects. pooling of data from
these studies showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of withdrawals due to side effects
(or 1.67, 95% ci 0.53 to 5.23).
duration of menses
four studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen assessed the
duration of menses. the chi square test for heterogeneity showed
there is significant heterogeneity within the comparison (19.52,

df=3, p=0.0002). to consider this heterogeneity, the data was analysed using a random effects model to take into account the variability between the studies when calculating the summary statistic.
pooling of data from these trials shows that there was no significant difference between the groups in the duration of menses after
treatment (wmd -0.74, 95%ci -2.31, 0.82).
dysmenorrhoea
one of the studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen reported
this outcome (bonduelle 1991). abdominal pain and backache
were assessed using a three point scoring system. the study compared before and after treatment scores for both measures of pain
for the two groups. for the  xxxd1806xxx  group there was no significant difference in the before and after treatment scores on either
of these measures of dysmenorrhoea (p>0.05). the post treatment
backache score was significantly lower than that at baseline for
the  xxxd2751xxx  group (p<0.05), but there was no significant
difference in the before and after treatment abdominal pain scores
(p>0.05). this trial was included as descriptive data in the other
data section due to the use of a non standard pain scale.
weight gain
three studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen reported
weight gain as an outcome measure. one trial reported weight gain
as mean weight gain, and showed that the mean weight gain was
significantly higher in the  xxxd1806xxx  group (wmd 2.80, 95% ci
1.60 to 4.00) (dunphy 1998). one study reported the number of
women with a weight gain of >2kg and the another reported the
number of women with weight gain of less than 3kg. for weight
gain as a dichotomous variable there was no significant difference
between the  xxxd1806xxx  and progestogen groups. where the number
of women with weight gain >2kg was assessed the or was 2.86
(95% ci 0.48 to 17.11) (higham 1993) and where the numbers
with weight gain less than 3kg was reported the or was 5.57 (95%
ci 0.48 to 64.09) (bonduelle 1991). but the reported results are
imprecise with wide confidence intervals.
efficacy of intervention
three studies included this outcome. one study assessed this objectively, reporting the number in each group with mbl of <80
ml at the end of the intervention, and the other two studies assessed efficacy subjectively. the study assessing efficacy objectively
showed a significant difference in favour of  xxxd1806xxx . significantly
more women in the  xxxd1806xxx  group had a mbl of less than 80 ml
at the end of the intervention (or 7.20 95% ci 1.28 to 40.37)
(higham 1993).
for subjective efficacy of medication, where efficacy was measured
as the number of women rating the treatment as highly or moderately effective, subjective efficacy was significantly better after
 xxxd1806xxx  treatment than after  xxxd2751xxx  (or 4.33, 95% ci
1.09 to 17.17) (higham 1993). where efficacy was assessed by
the numbers rating their mbl as none or moderate, there was no
significant difference between the two groups (or 5.83, 95% ci
0.70 to 48.87) (bonduelle 1991).

 xxxd1806xxx  versus. nsaids
three studies compared  xxxd1806xxx  with a nsaid for the treatment
of heavy menstrual bleeding. all three studies compared  xxxd1806xxx 
with  xxxd2556xxx  acid, but one trial also used naproxen as a comparison intervention.
menstrual blood loss (objective/subjective)
all three studies reported this outcome, and all assessed mbl using the alkaline haematin method. one small parallel trial (n=39)
in the meta-analysis showed that mean mbl after two months
treatment was significantly lower in the  xxxd1806xxx  group compared
to the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group (wmd -96.70, 95% ci -138.80,
-54.60) (dockeray 1989). two other trials are included as descriptive data in the other data section as one reported mbl in a
form unsuitable for inclusion in the meta analysis and in the other
the data showed significant skewness. one trial included in the
other data section, compared  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2556xxx  acid and
reported mbl as medians and ranges. in this trial the groups were
not comparable at baseline and the study compared mbl after
treatment to mbl at baseline for the different treatment groups,
rather than comparing mbl across the groups. mbl after treatment was significantly lower than that at baseline for the  xxxd1806xxx 
group (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between
the before and after treatment mbl values for the  xxxd2556xxx 
acid group (p>0.05) (cameron 1987). the other trial was a crossover trial which compared  xxxd1806xxx  with both  xxxd2556xxx  acid and
naproxen. when the mean and standard deviation were calculated
from the individual participant data and put into the meta-analysis, mean mbl after two months treatment was significantly lower
in the  xxxd1806xxx  group compared to both the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group
(p=0.001) and the naproxen group (p=0.02) (fraser 1991). these
figures refer to data prior to women crossing over to the other
treatment .
side effects
one study which compared  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2556xxx  acid reported this outcome. there were significantly more adverse effects
in the  xxxd1806xxx  group compared to the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group 75%
compared to 30% (or 7.00, 95% ci 1.74 to 28.17) (dockeray
1989). the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group complained mainly of nausea,
vomiting and diarrhoea; the  xxxd1806xxx  group complained of more
serious adverse effects such as musculoskeletal pains, dizziness,
flushes, acne, behavioural changes, tiredness, breast atrophy, hirsutism and hoarseness.
withdrawals due to side effects
none of the studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a nsaid reported
this outcome.
duration of menses
two trials in both of which  xxxd2556xxx  acid was the comparison
intervention assessed this outcome. pooling of data from these
trials showed the duration of menses was significantly shorter in
the  xxxd1806xxx  groups after two months of treatment (wmd -1.03;
95% ci -1.78 to -0.28).

dysmenorrhoea
one parallel study reported this outcome. dysmenorrhoea was assessed in two ways in the study; according to the number of women
in each intervention group who reported an improvement in dysmenorrhoea after two months treatment, and using a three point
pain scale scoring system. the number reporting an improvement
in dysmenorrhoea showed no significant difference between the
two interventions (or 1.20; 95% ci 0.20, 7.31). the dysmenorrhoea scores showed no significant difference between the two
groups after two months of treatment (p>0.05) (dockeray 1989).
the data for the dysmenorrhoea scores was included in the other
data section due to the use of a non-standard pain scale.
acceptability of treatment
one study included the outcome of the numbers in each group
unwilling to continue that particular treatment. this small parallel
trial (n=39) compared  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2556xxx  acid and showed
no significant difference between the two groups with regard to
the number unwilling to continue the treatment (or 1.11; 95%
ci 0.32 to 3.90) (dockeray 1989).
 xxxd1806xxx  versus. oral contraceptive
one small cross-over study involving 12 women compared  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with an oral contraceptive (ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx  30ug
and levonorgestrel 150ug) (fraser 1991). only the data prior to
the crossover were included in the analysis.
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)
blood loss was measured objectively using the alkaline haematin
method. after two months treatment mean mbl for the  xxxd1806xxx 
group was significantly lower than that for the oral contraceptive
group (p=0.02). the trial was included in the other data section
as descriptive data due to skew ness of the data.
other outcomes
the only trial comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with an oral contraceptive did
not report any other outcome measures.
 xxxd1806xxx  versus progesterone releasing iud
one trial with 14 women compared  xxxd1806xxx  with a progesterone
releasing intrauterine device (releasing 65ug progesterone daily)
for two months treatment.
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)
mbl was measured objectively using the alkaline haematin
method. the study compared mbl after the intervention with
that at baseline for each of the interventions, rather than making
comparisons between the groups as the groups were not comparable at baseline. for both groups mbl after the intervention was
significantly lower than that at baseline p<0.05 and p<0.01 for
the  xxxd1806xxx  and progesterone releasing iud interventions respectively (cameron 1987). the trial was included as descriptive data
in the other data section as the data was not reported in a form
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
duration of menses
the one trial comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progesterone releasing
iud reported data on the duration of menses after two months

treatment compared with that at baseline for each group. the
results show that the mean duration of menses was significantly
shorter in the  xxxd1806xxx  group (wmd -6.00; 95% ci -7.25 to 4.75).
 xxxd1806xxx  200 mg versus.  xxxd1806xxx  100 mg
one study involving 32 women compared  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with
 xxxd1806xxx  100 mg for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding
(chimbira 1980a).
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)
mbl was reported objectively after three months treatment and
compared with mean mbl at baseline for each group. for both
groups mean mbl after three months treatment was significantly
lower than mean mbl at baseline (p<0.01). there was no significant difference between the two groups after three months of
treatment (p=0.2) (chimbira 1980a). this trial was reported in
the other data section as descriptive data as the data showed significant skewness.
duration of menses
the mean duration of menses was included as one of the outcome
measures in the study comparing  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with  xxxd1806xxx 
100 mg. the authors reported that the duration of menses after
three months treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg was significantly
less than that at baseline (p<0.01). there was no significant difference in the duration of menses after three months treatment with
 xxxd1806xxx  100 mg compared to that at baseline (p>0.05). the trial
was reported as descriptive data in the other data section as the
figures were inadequately reported in the paper.
dysmenorrhoea
the study assessed the outcome of the numbers in each group
reporting an improvement in dysmenorrhoea after three months
treatment. for this outcome there was no significant difference between the two groups (or 0.68; 95% ci 0.12 to 3.83) (chimbira
1980a).
weight gain
the trial comparing  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with  xxxd1806xxx  100 mg reported the mean gain in weight for the two groups,  xxxd1806xxx  200
mg (mean weight gain 2.3 kg after three months of treatment),
 xxxd1806xxx  100 mg (mean of 2.1 kg) (chimbira 1980a). no standard deviations were reported in the trial so a wmd could not be
calculated.
 xxxd1806xxx  200 mg versus reducing dose  xxxd1806xxx 
one small parallel trial compared  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with a reducing
dose of  xxxd1806xxx  for three months treatment. thirty six women
were involved in this comparison. the reducing dose  xxxd1806xxx  was
a regime of  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day for one month, 100 mg/day the
next month and  xxxd1806xxx  50 mg/day for the third month.
menstrual blood loss (objective or subjective)
mean mbl was measured objectively after three months treatment, and there was no significant difference in mean mbl between the two groups (wmd 33.50; 95% ci -32.38 to 99.38)

(higham 1993).
side effects
the number of women in each intervention group experiencing
adverse effects was reported as an outcome measure. for this outcome there was no significant difference between the two groups
(or 1.13, 95% ci 0.14 to 9.07) (higham 1993).
withdrawals due to side effects
the number of withdrawals due to side effects showed no significant difference between the  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg group and the
group taking a reducing dose of  xxxd1806xxx  (or 0.88, 0.15 to 5.05)
(higham 1993).
weight gain
the study comparing  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg with a reducing dose of
 xxxd1806xxx  assessed the number of women in each group who had a
weight gain of less than 2kg after three months treatment. there
was no significant difference between the two groups on this outcome measure (or 0.32, 95% ci 0.08 to 1.28) (higham 1993).
duration of menses
the mean duration of menses for women in the two intervention
groups was assessed after three months treatment. the only trial in
the meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the two
intervention groups (wmd 1.30, 95%ci -0.76 to 3.36) (higham
1993).
subjective efficacy of intervention
subjective efficacy was measured as the number of women rating
the treatment as highly or moderately effective in each of the intervention groups. there was no significant difference between the
two groups after three months of daily treatment (or 1.18, 95%
ci 0.30 to 4.73) (higham 1993).

discussion
the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of  xxxd1806xxx  for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.
despite the fact that  xxxd1806xxx  has been available for the treatment
of menorrhagia for a considerable length of time, there is a general
lack of well-designed research to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of this therapy. the results of this review are based on a
small number of trials which are underpowered and with unclear
allocation concealment.
the largest trial had 20 women in each arm. a power calculation
for sample size based on a (alpha)=0.05 and b (beta)=0.80 where
 xxxd1806xxx  treatment is compared to either progestogen or nsaid
therapy (the most common medical treatments) indicated that
at least 30 women in each arm would be required to show an
acceptable increase in benefit (30%) in the proportion of women
having their menstrual bleeding reverting to normal (<80 mls/
cycle). it was not feasible to consider a benefit of treatment in terms
of the actual quantity of blood loss, mls/cycle, that women find
satisfactory and no data were available to assess satisfaction with

treatment. therefore, where no differences between interventions
are reported, it may be that the trials are too small to show any
difference.
menstrual blood loss: objective measurement
 xxxd1806xxx  was shown to be no more effective than progestogens
at reducing mbl by one trial included in the meta-analysis. if
response to treatment is defined as reduction of menstrual blood
loss to <80 ml/cycle, significantly more women in the  xxxd1806xxx 
group had their mbl reduced to below 80 ml/cycle. another trial,
included as descriptive data, suggested that  xxxd1806xxx  may be more
effective than progestogens at reducing mbl. one limitation of
the studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen is that in all
these studies, the progestogen was given in the luteal phase of the
cycle (days 19-26). progestogens given during the luteal phase of
the cycle in women with ovulatory hmb may increase, rather
than reduce menstrual blood loss (preston 1995).
 xxxd1806xxx  was shown to be more effective at reducing mbl than
 xxxd2556xxx  acid by the one trial included in the meta-analysis and
two other trials.  xxxd1806xxx  was also shown to be more effective than
naproxen at reducing mbl by one small trial included in the metaanalysis. thus there is consistent evidence that  xxxd1806xxx  is more
effective than nsaids in reducing mbl.
 xxxd1806xxx  was shown to be more effective at reducing mbl than
the oral contraceptive pill by one small trial included as other
data. the results of one trial included as descriptive data indicate
 xxxd1806xxx  is no more effective than a progestogen releasing iud in
reducing mbl.
on the available evidence, a 200 mg daily  xxxd1806xxx  regime appears
to be no more effective in reducing mbl compared to  xxxd1806xxx 
100 mg or a reducing dose  xxxd1806xxx  regimen. there are some
limitations to this evidence. the results are based on one trial and
small numbers of women for all comparisons and the data for
some comparisons are heavily skewed.
it is possible that the differences found were underestimated. trials
were included in this review if women had a subjective complaint
of heavy menstrual bleeding and/or if they had objectively determined heavy menstrual bleeding. in all of the included studies,
women had a subjective complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding
and in five studies, women had their mbl objectively measured by
the alkaline haematin method. to comply with the definition of
objectively defined menorrhagia, trials would have to include only
women with mbl>80 ml/cycle. however in one study women
were included if their objectively defined mbl was>50 ml/cycle
(cameron 1987) and another included women with a mbl of
>60 ml/cycle. menorrhagia was correctly defined as objectively determined mbl of >80 ml/cycle in three studies (dockeray 1989;
dunphy 1998; higham 1993).
many women who seek medical help for heavy menstrual bleeding
have normal blood loss (fraser 1984; haynes 1977) and results

from one rct have suggested that there is little response to therapy
in women with mbl <35 ml (fraser 1981). since a proportion of
the study women with a complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding
may have had normal menstrual blood loss, it is likely that some
reported differences between treatment and placebo groups have
been underestimated.
menstrual blood loss: subjective measurement
whilst the alkaline haematin extraction method is the most accurate method for assessment of blood loss and is used as the
standard, a woman’s own perception of her mbl is important in
the evaluation of effectiveness of treatment on mbl. therefore a
woman’s subjective assessment is an important outcome measure.
three studies recorded mbl according to subjective measures.
one trial compared  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg daily and a placebo and
the authors reported that  xxxd1806xxx  was significantly more effective
after two months treatment.  xxxd1806xxx  was shown to be significantly
more effective than progestogens at reducing mbl by one study
which used a pictorial bleeding chart method to assess mbl and
by one study which used a bleeding intensity score to assess mbl.
the subjective assessment of mbl is an important outcome measure, as most diagnoses and interventions for heavy menstrual
bleeding are based on clinical evidence, in the absence of objectively determined heavy menstrual bleeding. it is therefore important in practice that any intervention results in a significant improvement in the woman’s own perceived cyclical loss.
menstrual blood loss after cessation of
therapy
it has been reported that  xxxd1806xxx  has a significant ’carry-over’
effect and many women have reduced mbl for up to four months
after cessation of therapy (shaw 1994), suggesting that  xxxd1806xxx 
could be used intermittently.  xxxd1806xxx  might be more acceptable
in clinical use if it could be effectively used intermittently. there
are no studies assessing intermittent  xxxd1806xxx  use for hmb, but
two of the included studies (dunphy 1998; lamb 1987) assessed
whether  xxxd1806xxx  has a significant ’carry-over’ effect. lamb (1987)
reported that a reduction in blood loss score was maintained for
four months after treatment ceased, but insufficient information
was provided for these data to be included in the review. this
finding was not confirmed in one study which compared  xxxd1806xxx 
with a progestogen, and found there to be no significant carry-over
effect of  xxxd1806xxx  3 months after treatment was stopped (dunphy
1998).
as  xxxd1806xxx  has a rapid and significant effect on increasing haemoglobin and serum ferritin (chimbira 1979; ford 1994), it may be
valuable in women who need a highly effective short term treatment to stop very heavy bleeding and restore their haemoglobin
and iron status to normal. one of the potential short term uses
of  xxxd1806xxx  is to use it intermittently, however there is currently

 xxxd1806xxx  for heavy menstrual bleeding (review)

12

insufficient evidence to assess whether  xxxd1806xxx  can be effectively
used on an intermittent basis.
adverse events
there were no significant differences in reported adverse effects
with  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg in comparison with a reducing dose  xxxd1806xxx . no data are available for whether women treated with  xxxd1806xxx 
experience more adverse effects than those treated with the oral
contraceptive or a progestogen releasing iud. however, women
treated with  xxxd1806xxx  experienced significantly more adverse effects than those treated with a progestogen and those treated with
 xxxd2556xxx  acid.
 xxxd1806xxx  has weak androgenic properties, and hence can cause side
effects related to this. these side effects spontaneously resolve after
cessation of treatment. none of the included trials reported data
on numbers experiencing specific adverse events in a suitable form
for inclusion in this review, but commonly reported side effects
for  xxxd1806xxx  treatment included acne, weight gain, headache, nausea and tiredness. one study comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with  xxxd2556xxx 
acid, reported that women in the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group experienced mostly gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea/vomiting
and diarrhoea, whereas women in the  xxxd1806xxx  group experienced
more serious side effects such as musculoskeletal pains, flushes,
behavioural changes, lethargy, and androgenic effects such as acne,
breast atrophy, hirsutism and hoarseness (dockeray 1989).
women using  xxxd1806xxx  for heavy menstrual bleeding are likely to
require long term treatment, so any adverse events which affect
adherence to treatment or treatment safety are particularly important. one study reported that for the women treated with  xxxd1806xxx , the side effects of breast atrophy, hirsutism and hoarseness
did not develop until the second month of treatment (dockeray
1989). as the studies included in this review all involved two to
three months treatment, data on the side effect profile of  xxxd1806xxx 
for longer term treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  would be useful. a longer
period of treatment would enable the longer term liver effects of
 xxxd1806xxx  to be assessed. these potential liver effects may be an
important factor limiting the long term use of  xxxd1806xxx  and they
have not been evaluated by any of the studies.
weight gain
weight gain is one of the androgenic side effects of  xxxd1806xxx  which
may limit its use (irvine 1999), and is therefore an important
outcome measure. when compared to placebo, the mean weight
of the  xxxd1806xxx  group was significantly greater than that of the
placebo group after two months treatment. three studies assessed
weight gain for  xxxd1806xxx  compared with a progestogen. the mean
weight gain of the  xxxd1806xxx  group was significantly greater than
that of the progestogen group. however when weight gain was
assessed in terms of the number of women with a weight gain of
less than 2kg (higham 1993) and the number of women with
a weight gain of less than 3kg (bonduelle 1991), there was no

significant difference between the two interventions. there was
no significant difference in terms of the number of women with
weight gain of less than 2kg when  xxxd1806xxx  200mg was compared
with a reducing dose of  xxxd1806xxx . however assessment of weight
gain by a dichotomous outcome may not be sensitive to determine
real differences between the groups. one study compared mean
weight gain for  xxxd1806xxx  200mg versus 100 mg. there appears to
be no difference in terms of mean weight gain between these regimens, however there is currently insufficient evidence to answer
this question.
withdrawals due to side effects
there was no significant difference in withdrawals due to side
effects when  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg daily was compared to placebo,
progestogens or a reducing dose  xxxd1806xxx . however, due to the
small number of women involved in the studies, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate this outcome adequately. it may be that
the numbers are too small to reveal any differences between the
groups. the large drop out rates of several trials (five studies had
drop out rates of more than 10%) points towards the treatment
being unacceptable to women. some of these may be unreported
withdrawals due to side effects.
dysmenorrhoea
there was no significant difference between  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day,
nsaids and a reducing dose of  xxxd1806xxx  in terms of the number
of women reporting an improvement in dysmenorrhoea. there is
insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference
between  xxxd1806xxx  and progestogens with regards to improvement
in dysmenorrhoea. one study has evaluated this, and the results
indicate that progestogens may produce a greater improvement in
dysmenorrhoea (bonduelle 1991).
duration of menses
a significant reduction in the duration of menses in favour of
 xxxd1806xxx  is shown for those trials comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with nsaids
and a progesterone releasing iud. the results of one trial indicate
that the duration of menses may be shorter after treatment with
a 200mg  xxxd1806xxx  regimen when compared with a 100 mg regimen. another study showed that the duration of menses is significantly shorter for women treated with a reducing dose of  xxxd1806xxx 
compared to those treated with  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day. there is no
significant difference in the duration of menses when  xxxd1806xxx  is
compared to progestogens. the results from one trial comparing
 xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen, indicate that  xxxd1806xxx  may cause substantially more protracted bleeding in some women, whereas this
is not the case for  xxxd2751xxx  (higham 1993). the reason for
this is unknown.
efficacy of intervention
two studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx  with a progestogen evaluated subjective efficacy of treatment. one study showed subjective efficacy

13

was significantly greater for  xxxd1806xxx , where as the second found
no difference between the two interventions.
acceptability of intervention

 xxxd1806xxx  is more effective than progestogens, nsaids and the
ocp, although the results are imprecise with wide confidence intervals.
3. what is the optimum dosage of  xxxd1806xxx ?

one study comparing  xxxd1806xxx  and  xxxd2556xxx  acid assessed the
acceptability of treatment , and found there was no difference
between the two treatments in terms of the number of women
unwilling to continue treatment. however, it may be that too
few women were included in the analysis to show any difference
between the groups. the study reported that the reason women
were unwilling to continue treatment differed between the two
groups. for the  xxxd2556xxx  acid group, the reason most women
gave for being unwilling to continue treatment was due to a lack
of efficacy, whereas for women in the  xxxd1806xxx  group it was largely
due to side effects (dockeray 1989).
dosage
one of the objectives of this review is to determine the optimum
dosage of  xxxd1806xxx  as a treatment for hmb. two small trials compared the standard dose of  xxxd1806xxx  for hmb, 200 mg/day with
a lower dose of 100 mg and a reducing dose regimen. no differences in effectiveness or frequency of adverse events were reported,
but women treated with 200 mg/day had a shorter duration of
menses when compared with a reducing dose regimen. numbers
of women in the trials were insufficient to adequately assess this
outcome.
it is important to note that there are no studies comparing  xxxd1806xxx 
with  xxxd3410xxx  and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine
system (mirena). these treatments may be as effective as  xxxd1806xxx ,
but an objective comparison has not been carried out.
no study has included changes in quality of life or resource cost as
outcome measures.  xxxd1806xxx  has a contraceptive effect in doses of
above 200 mg/day, however it is not licensed for use as a contraceptive, and therefore women not wishing to conceive require additional contraception. this is particularly important with  xxxd1806xxx  as it is has a teratogenic effect and there is a risk of less thanof a
female fetus if exposure to  xxxd1806xxx  is continued between 8 and 18
weeks of gestation. this means that the acceptability of  xxxd1806xxx 
to women, and quality of life outcomes are very important and
they have not been properly addressed by any of the trials.
summary of these results in terms of the objectives

the standard dose of 200 mg/day of  xxxd1806xxx  does not appear
to differ in effectiveness and frequency of adverse events when
compared to 100 mg/day or a reducing regimen. however these
results are based on one small trial for each comparison.
4. does treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  lead to an improved quality of
life for women with hmb?
the included trials only assessed improvement in dysmenorrhoea
and there were insufficient data to address this outcome adequately.
5. do women tolerate treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  and find it acceptable?
there was an increased frequency of adverse events when  xxxd1806xxx 
was compared with other medical therapies. this did not appear to
affect the acceptability of the treatment. however this comparison
was only reported by one small study.

authors’ conclusions
implications for practice
the results do not give clear indications for recommending  xxxd1806xxx  as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.  xxxd1806xxx  appears to
be an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding when compared to other medical treatments, though it is uncertain whether
it is acceptable to women. the use of  xxxd1806xxx  may be limited by
its side effect profile, its acceptability to women and the need for
continuing treatment.

implications for research
additional well designed rcts with sufficient power are needed to
test the efficacy of  xxxd1806xxx  compared to other medical therapies.
future trial design needs to include outcomes such as quality of
life measures and a longer period of treatment (at least six months)
to adequately evaluate adverse events and participant satisfaction.
however, there may be difficulties in doing long term research
because of the side effects of  xxxd1806xxx  and the existence of more
acceptable alternatives.

study

reason for exclusion

chimbira 1980b

8 women were recruited in a placebo controlled trial, each patient took placebo for 2 cycles, followed by  xxxd1806xxx 
for 2 cycles. this is likely to cause bias since there is no controlling for the time effect

need 1992

11 women were recruited for this study. patients took  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day for 1 month, patients were then split
into 4 groups and given either  xxxd1806xxx  200 mg/day,  xxxd1806xxx  100 mg/day,  xxxd1806xxx  50 mg/day or placebo. there
was concern that there was no a sufficient washout period between the 2 phases of the trial, which is likely to
cause bias. also the numbers randomised to each of the 4 arms of the 2nd phase of the trial were very small, and
some of the results became meaningless
