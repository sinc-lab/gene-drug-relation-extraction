construction and characterization of a novel fusion protein consisting of  xxxd2676xxx  antibody fused to recombinant interleukin-2.  t cells can be activated in vitro by monoclonal antibodies to cd3 ( xxxd2676xxx ) to become non-mhc restricted killer cells (cd3-ak).  xxxd2676xxx  activation upregulates the expression of the interleukin (il)-2 receptors on t cells whose expansion is facilitated by il-2. the therapeutic effect of in vivo administration of  xxxd2676xxx  and il-2 has been investigated in many types of human cancers. to circumvent the toxicities posed by systemic administration of high-dose il-2, there is interest in forming a strategy for targeting and concentrating il-2 at the site where it is needed. this study investigates the feasibility of constructing a novel fusion protein consisting of il-2 fused to the constant region of  xxxd2676xxx  antibody. our results indicate that the specific  xxxg1175xxx -binding capability and bioactivity of the il-2 portion as well as the cd3-binding and biological functions of  xxxd2676xxx  portion remain intact in this  xxxd2676xxx /il-2 fusion protein. thus, cytokines fused to  xxxd2676xxx  antibody by genetic engineering is feasible and may provide a new class of immunotherapeutics for cancer.
