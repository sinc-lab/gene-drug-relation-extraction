local anesthetics suppress excitability
by interfering
with ion channel function. ensheathment
of peripheral
nerve fibers, however, impedes diffusion of drugs to
the ion channels and may influence the evaluation of
local anesthetic potencies. investigating
ion channels in
excised membrane patches avoids these diffusion barriers. we investigated the effect of local anesthetics with
voltage-dependent
nail and k ’ channels in enzymatitally dissociated sciatic nerve fibers of xcnoptls laeuis
using the patch clamp method. the outside-out configuration was chosen to apply drugs to the external face
of the membrane. local anesthetics reversibly blocked
the transient na ’ inward current, as well as the steadystate k’~ outward
current. half-maximal

any authors have investigated the effect of
local anesthetics on peripheral nerve excitability. early experiments studying compound action potentials in sciatic nerves demonstrated the failure of action potential conduction during local
anesthetic exposure. in voltage clamp experiments on
squid giant axons (1) and on single myelinated frog
nerve fibers (2), na+ inward current underlying the
action potential was reversibly blocked by these
drugs. subsequent studies further explained the

(logi”‘) revealed that ester-bound local anesthetics were
more potent in blocking na+ channels than amide
drugs. within these groups, lipophilicity
governed local anesthetic potency. we conclude that local anesthetic action on peripheral nerve ion channels is mediated via lipophilic drug-channel interactions. implications:
half-maximal blocking concentrations of commonly used
local anesthetics for na+ and km’ channel block were
determined
on small membrane
patches of peripheral nerve fibers. because drugs can directly diffuse
to the ion channel in this model, these data result
from direct interactions
of the drugs with ion

mechanisms of local anesthesia (3,4) and led to distinct
theories on ion channel blocking mechanisms, such as
the modulated receptor hypothesis (5,6) and the
guarded receptor hypothesis (7). development of the
patch clamp method (8) enabled direct investigations
of molecular interactions of local anesthetics and different ion channels. however, these experiments were
mostly conducted on cell bodies of excitable neural
tissues, not on axonal ion channels, which are the
primary target for local anesthesia. we used the axonal patch clamp method (9,lo) for the first time to
determine potencies of clinically used local anesthetics
in suppressing na+ and delayed rectifier k ’ channels
of peripheral nerve. this method allows the direct
application of drugs to ion channels in amphibian
peripheral nerve fibers and enabled us to compare the
blocking potencies of local anesthetics with the blocking potencies reported for other ion channels.

methods
sciatic nerves of the clawed toad xenopus laevis were
enzymatically
prepared as described elsewhere (9). in
brief, sciatic nerves of the animals were dissected,
desheathed,
and treated with collagenase and protease to obtain single, partially demyelinated
fibers.
the procedures
were approved
by the appropriate
animal care and use committee. for recording axonal
ionic currents,
the outside-out
configuration
of the
patch clamp method (8) was applied to partially demyelinated
axons. patch pipettes were pulled from
borosilicate
glass (clark electromedical
instruments,
pangbourne, uk) coated with sylgard 184 (dow corning, seneffe, belgium) and were fire-polished
at the tip
before use. the resistance of the pipettes after filling
with internal solution was 15-25 ma. the bath solution contained (in mm): nacl 115; kc1 2.5;  xxxg2125xxx , 2;
hepes 10, adjusted to ph 7.4 with tris. for nat
current recording,
10 mm tetraethylammoniumchloride was added to suppress kt currents (ri-tea); for
k+ current recording, 100 nm tetrodotoxin
was added
to suppress na+ currents (ri-ttx). the pipette solution for na+ current recording
contained (in mm):
cscl 110; nacl13; egta 2, hepes 10, ph adjusted to
7.2 with tris (cscli). for the investigation
of kt
channels, cscl was replaced with kc1 (kcl,).
different
concentrations
of local anesthetics
were
applied to the patches using a multiple-barrel
perfusion system that allowed solution exchanges within
1 s. all local anesthetics were purchased as hydrochloride salts from sigma (deisenhofen,
germany), except
etidocaine and mepivacaine, which were obtained as
clinical formulations
from astra (wedel, germany).
after forming an outside-out
patch from the nodal
membrane, the holding potential was adjusted to -90
mv in the voltage clamp mode of an epc7 patchclamp amplifier
(list, darmstadt,
germany).
the
pulse protocol used to elicit na+ currents comprised a
50-ms prepulse to -130 mv to remove fast inactivation, followed
by a 50-ms test pulse to -40 mv to
activate nat currents. steady-state kt currents were
activated by a 50-ms potential step to 60 mv and were
measured as the mean current during the last 20 ms of
the pulse. for analysis, currents were filtered with a
four-pole
bessel filter, digitized
with a labmaster
tm-40 ad/da
board (scientific solutions,
solon,
oh), and stored on the hard disk of a computer. to
reduce the noise of single current traces that originated from individual channel openings, 20 successive
traces, elicited every 5 s, were averaged to measure the
peak nat current or steady-state kt current. blocking
potencies of the local anesthetics were determined by
analyzing concentration
inhibition curves, which were
constructed
by measuring
the inhibition of the peak
na+ current or steady-state
kt current amplitude at
different
concentrations
(c) normalized
to control.

results
na+ currents recorded from outside-out patches had a
peak amplitude
of 50-150 pa. assuming
a single
channel current of 1 pa per channel at -40 mv (9),
this current results from simultaneous
openings of
50-150 channels at the peak. externally applied local
anesthetics reversibly blocked the peak na+ current in
a concentration-dependent
manner, as shown for lidocaine (fig. 1a). the steady-state
outward
kt current
(fig. 1b) was also reversibly blocked; however, higher
local anesthetic concentrations
were necessary,
and
block was not complete at high concentrations.
onand offset of na’ and kt current block was rapid for
all the local anesthetics investigated
and occurred in a
few seconds. potencies of local anesthetics
in suppressing
nat and k+ channels were derived from
concentration-inhibition
curves for different local anesthetics (fig. 2). ic,, values, as revealed by nonlinear
least-squares
fitting of the data, are listed in table 1.

nat current and b,,, was assumed to be 0.8 for k+
current. fitting the data with varying hill coefficients
(p) resulted in values of 0.99-1.22. assuming
firstorder binding kinetics, p was fixed to 1 before fitting
and reporting the ic,, data. the naf channel blocking
potencies (ic,, values) of all local anesthetics correlated poorly (y = -0.71) with their lipid solubilities,
measured
as octanol:buffer
partition
coefficient
(logp”). however,
if only amide-linked
local anesthetics are considered
(mepivacaine,
lidocaine,  xxxd383xxx ,
etidocaine),
the correlation
was good
(y = -0.93) (fig. 3a). local anesthetics dissociate into
charged
(protonated)
and neutral
(unprotonated)
forms depending on their pka values. the fraction of
the neutral drug (f,) at a given ph can be calculated
from the drug’s pka value as f. = l/(1 + 10[pka- xxxg102xxx ).
considering
the amount of neutral drug in the ic,,
values improved
the correlation
of the amide-linked
drugs with logi?’ to y = -0.99 (fig. 3b).

discussion
the primary target tissue for local anesthetics is the
peripheral nerve in which excitability is impaired by
the interaction of these drugs with axonal ion channels. studies investigating
the effects of local anesthetics on peripheral
nerve na+ channels have mainly
been conducted
on intact nerves measuring
compound action potentials or on single fibers using voltage clamp techniques (4). in all these experiments,
the
connective tissue surrounding
the fibers must be penetrated by the drugs before nat channels are blocked.
in this study, the effects of local anesthetics on axonal ion channels were studied in outside-out patches.

the direct exposure of the channels in the patch to the
test solution. impeding diffusion barriers such as the
epi-, peri-, and endoneurium
or the myelin sheath are
absent in these experiments,
which facilitates investigations of interactions
between the drug and the ion
channel. the ic,, values presented herein thus reflect
direct binding of the local anesthetic molecule to the
ion channel protein. to ensure full availability of naf
channels, i.e., removal of inactivation,
the membrane
holding potential was set to -90 mv, and a 50-ms
prepulse to -130 mv was applied before na+ current
activation.
phasic (use-dependent)
block as induced by repetitive
membrane depolarizations
under local anesthetics was
not investigated in our experiments. because of the small
number of ion channels in a patch (50-150), there were
large fluctuations of current amplitude caused by random channel openings in successive traces. averaging
20 traces in control and in drug solution reduced this
channel noise but made the investigation of phasic (usedependent) block impossible.
potencies for na’ and kt channel block in xenopus
nerve fibers have already been determined
for lidocaine and procaine in early nonner clamp experiments (ll), a method that allows the measurement
of
ionic currents
in a single node of ranvier of large
myelinated nerve fibers (12). in contrast to outside-out
patches, the myelin sheath and endoneurium
surrounding the axons were still intact in these preparations and acted as a diffusion
barrier for all drugs
superfusing
the nerve. ic,, values for procaine and
lidocaine were 5-10 times higher for nat and k’
current
inhibition
in nonner
clamp experiments,
which indicates possible impediment
of drug diffusion by the myelin sheath and the endoneurium.
furthermore, in our experiments,
the application of local
anesthetics reduced the na+ peak or steady-state
k+
current in a few seconds and was well reversed in the
same time period after switching
back to the control
solution. conversely,
in nonner clamp experiments,
washout
of high local anesthetic concentrations
required several minutes and depended on the duration
of exposure of the nerve to the drug (11). this observation can be explained by the absorption
of large
local anesthetic quantities in the myelin sheath, which
still surrounds
the axon in these experiments.
slow
release of the drug during washout procedures
continues to block nodal ion channels, resulting in a slow
reversibility.
two general theories try to explain local anesthetic
action upon excitability: 1) general perturbation
of the
lipid bilayer can result in altered channel function;
and 2) specific interaction of the drug molecule with
one or more binding sites on the ion channel protein
can directly impair channel function. the membrane
perturbation
theory predicts the dependence of local
anesthetic potency on its lipid solubility, whereas the

structural elements of the drug and the ion channel are
more important in the specific receptor theory.
the potencies of all local anesthetics investigated
demonstrate a poor correlation with the logarithm of
their logi”, i.e., lipid solubilities, a result that favors
the specific receptor theory rather than nonspecific
membrane perturbation effects. however, if only
amide local anesthetics are considered, a good correlation with logi” is observed, which is even better if
only the neutral, i.e., lipophilic portion, of the drug is
considered as the active form. the basic structure of
the molecule-ester or amide type- is probably important for its binding affinity to na+ channels,
whereas lipid solubility determines the potency
within these classeseither by governing its concentration in the membrane or by hydrophobic binding to
the channel protein. similar results have been obtained from potencies derived from the reduction of
the axonal peak nat current in vaseline gap experiments (13) and more unspecifically from the reduction
of compound action potential amplitudes (14). in these
experiments, however, connective tissue, which must

be penetrated by the drugs before na+ channel block,
was still present and may account for dependence on
lipid solubility.
more evidence for specific drug-channel interactions comes from different affinities of one local anesthetic to different axonal ion channels. for example,
ester-linked local anesthetics such as procaine and
tetracaine are potent blockers of na+ currents but
have less effect on voltage-dependent k+ currents and
almost no effect on an axonal background channel
(flicker channel) observed in small myelinated fibers
(15). conversely,  xxxd383xxx  is a much more potent
blocker of the flicker k+ channel than of the na+
channel in the same preparation, and lidocaine is
equally potent in blocking both channel types. membrane perturbation, as an nonspecific effect, would
result in more nonspecific blocking effects of all different ion channels in the same membrane. in cloning
experiments, a putative local anesthetic binding site
has been identified in the pore region on the a-subunit
of rat brain nat channels expressed in xenopus oocytes (16), which supports the hypothesis that local
anesthetics act via specific receptors located on ion
channels. besides these specific effects, some nonspecific interactions may exist and contribute to channel
block at higher drug concentrations.
in summary, in this article, we report fundamental
ic,, values for peripheral nerve na+ and kt channel
block by commonly used local anesthetics. ester local
anesthetics were more potent in blocking na+ channels than amide drugs, but within these groups, lipophilicity determined potency. lipophilic interaction
with the nat channel is the most likely mechanism of
peripheral nerve na+ channel block.
