absrract: the receptor pharmacology of  xxxd162xxx  was investigated with in vitro radioligand binding technique.
 xxxd162xxx  possessed a high affinity to the 5-ht, receptors (ki= 16.5k2.1 nm) and a moderate affinity to a,-adrenergic
receptors of rat cerebral cortical membranes (k,=172k 14 nm). the affinity of  xxxd162xxx  for striatal and limbic
dopamine d, receptors was low and not significantly different (k, k s.e.m. = 540 & 59 nm vs 403 k 4 2 nm; p < 0. i i , n =
4). the affinity for striatal and limbic sht, receptors was measured as well and found to be very close to the affinity
to the cerebral cortical sht, receptor. the drug affinity for d, and 5-ht, receptors seems thus not to be influenced by
the location of the receptor moiety. the affinity for several other rat brain receptors such as 5-ht,,, a,-adrenergic,
dopamine d,, muscarinic mi and m2, opiate sigma and p,-adrenergic was low.
the pseudo-hill coefficient of the  xxxd162xxx  competition binding curve was consistently higher than one indicating
antagonistic and complex interactions with the  xxxg1113xxx  or with a,-adrenergic and dopamine d, receptors.
the antagonistic properties of  xxxd162xxx  were investigated by its ability to antagonize the serotonin-induced formation
of inositol-i-phosphate in human blood platelets.  xxxd162xxx  inhibited this sht, receptor-mediated intracellular response
with similar potency as  xxxd2419xxx .
these results suggest that  xxxd162xxx  is a selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist.

 xxxd162xxx  is a psychotropic drug with potent effects in
animal behavioural models of predictive value for antipsychotic activity and is currently undergoing clinical trials.
 xxxd162xxx  potently antagonizes 5-htp induced head
twitches (gustafsson et al. 1986). a behavioural response
thought to be mainly mediated by brain serotonergic 5ht, receptors (peroutka & snyder 1982). an involvement
of a,-adrenergic receptors cannot be excluded (arnt et al.
1984).
 xxxd162xxx  has previously been shown to possess high
affinity for 5-htz receptors in in vitro ligand binding
studies, but to possess substantially lower affinity for a,and a,-adrenergic, d, dopaminergic and 5-ht,, serotonergic receptors (svartengren & christensson 1985;
haskins et al. 1987).
this study summarizes the receptor pharmacology of
 xxxd162xxx  based on own studies (svartengren & christensson 1985; svartengren el al. 1986; svartengren & celander 1988) and results from other laboratories (haskins
e / al. 1987; engel et al. 1989; brian largent, personal
communication).
it is not known whether  xxxd162xxx  acts at the 5ht, receptor as an agonist or as an antagonist, but indirect evidence such as competition curve slope and inhibition of 5-htp induced head twitches suggests that  xxxd162xxx  is an antagonist. in order to obtain further support for this assumption  xxxd162xxx  was tested for its
ability to inhibit 5-ht-induced formation of inositol-lphosphate in human blood platelets, as it is known that
the 5-ht, receptor is linked to inositol phosphate formation in brain (conn & sanders-bush 1984) and in human
platelets (de chaffoy de courcelles et al. 1985; simonsson & alling 1988).

animals
male sprague-dawley rats (mollegaard, denmark) weighing
30cl350 g, were used. the animals were kept in a room with a 12/
12 hrs light-dark cycle and had free access to water and food
(pellets).
preparation of tissue homogenate
the rats were decapitated and cerebral cortex, striatum (g. pallidus,
n. caudate, putamen) and limbic forebrain (n. accumbens, olfactory
tubercle, septum) were rapidly dissected on ice. the dissection procedure and definition of rat brain structures were slightly modified
from the procedure used by horn & phillipson (1976). the tissues
were homogenized on ice in tris buffcr, ph 7.4, using a polytron
homogenizer. the homogenates were washed several times by centrifugation and the final pellet resuspended in buffer. in some cases a
preincubation (10 min, 37°c) step were included in order to inactivate endogenous neurotransmitters. the protein concentration of
the final tissue homogenate was determined (lowry et al. 1951) and
the tissue homogenate was stored at - 80°c until used.
binding assays

tissue homogenate was incubated with the appropriate radioligand
(table 1) and increasing concentrations (io-"to lo-' m) ofamperozide hci according to methods previously described by the following investigators: ' xxxd736xxx -oh-dpat (peroutka 1985), 'h- xxxd2419xxx 
(leysen et al. 1982), 'h- xxxd3000xxx  (greengrass & bremner 1979), 'hclonidine (u'prichard et al. 1977), 'h-sch 23390 (billard e f al.
1984) ,'h-spiroperidol (grigoriadis & seeman 1985) and 'h-qnb
(vanderheyden et al. 1987).
following incubation, the contents were rapidly filtered by a
skatron cell harvester using whatman gf/b glass-fiber filter mats.
the filter circles were cut out, dried for 30 min and placed into
scintillation minivials and 4 ml of beckman ready protein scintillation cocktail added. the vials were counted 24 hrs later in a
beckman ls 1801 scintillation counter.

competition of  xxxd162xxx  for 'h-ligand binding in various brain regions. affinities were determined using the curve fitting program
ligand or graphically (a,-adrenergic and di) as described in material and methods. the ki values are averages+s.e.m. from two to
seven individual experiments.

inositol-i-phosphate assay
the assay of inositol- 1-phosphate following stimulation of human
platelets with 5-ht was performed according to berridge el al.
(1982) and simonsson & alling (1988). in brief, 'h-labelled human
platelets were stimulated with
m 5-ht for 10 min in the
presence of 10 mm lici. when  xxxd162xxx  or  xxxd2419xxx  was
used, these agents were added 10 min prior to stimulation. after
extraction of platelets, the water-soluble phase was applied to a
dowex 1-8x column and 'h-ip, eluted with 200 mm ammonium
formate in 100 mm  xxxd2154xxx .
data analysis
competition binding data were analysed by the iterative curve fitting program ebda (mcpehrson 1983) to provide estimates of
affinity and slope factor (analogous to the pseudo-hill coefficient).
detailed analyses were performed using the iterative, non-linear
curve fitting program ligand (munson & rodbard 1980) run on
a vax computer system.
non-specific binding (ni) was determined by iteration of the
entire displacement curve of the defining ligand (table 1) using
untransformed data. this approach was in good agreement with
the conventional definition of non-specific binding, since the plateau
coincided closely to the level obtained by excess defining ligand.
the value of ni was used to constrain the binding data of
 xxxd162xxx  and other drugs run in parallel experiments in order to
obtain the specific receptor binding and thus the k, value. the kivalues of  xxxd162xxx  to dopamine d, and a,-adrenergic receptors
were determined graphically. the k, values were averaged out from
2 to 7 individual experiments.

results and discussion
in vitro receptor binding data indicate a high affinity of
 xxxd162xxx  for the 5-ht, receptor in rat cerebral cortex as
is shown in table 1. it should also be noted in table 1 that
 xxxd162xxx  interacts with the 5-ht, receptor in striatum
and limbic forebrain with high and similar affinity as for
the cortical  xxxg1113xxx . it suggests that the location of
the receptor does not influence the drug affinity.
 xxxd162xxx  binds to the a,-adrenergic receptor with
moderate affinity and to the a,-adrenergic, 5-ht,,, dopaminergic d, and d,, muscarinic mi and m2 receptors with
low affinity, which indicate a selectivity of  xxxd162xxx  for
the 5-ht, receptor. data from other laboratories show no

affinity for the 5-ht,, and 5-htic (haskins et al. 1987),
p,-adrenergic, opiate sigma (brian largent, personal communication) and benzodiazepine receptor (engel et al.
1989). these data further confirm that  xxxd162xxx  is a
selective 5-ht, receptor drug. it cannot, however, be excluded that  xxxd162xxx  could be potent at some as yet not
tested receptor type such as gaba, histamine or excitatory
amino acid receptors.
similarly as for the 5-ht, receptor the affinity of  xxxd162xxx  for the dopamine d, receptor from two tissue sources
- striatum and limbic forebrain -are not significantly different. in vitro affinity to d, or 5-ht, receptor can therefore
not explain the proposed functional limbic selectivity of
 xxxd162xxx  (gustafsson et al. 1986; svartengren et al. 1986).
haskins et al. (1987) found no difference in the regional
affinity of  xxxd162xxx  either. other in vitro binding studies
indicate increased drug affinity of atypical neuroleptics for
limbic d, receptors as compared to the striatal d, receptor
(borison el al. 1983) or no change (seeman & ulpian, 1983;
reynolds et al. 1982). altar et al. (1986) demonstrated using
in vitro autoradiographic technique a slightly increased affinity of clozapine and thioridazine for limbic structures.

j. svartengren and p. simonsson

pettersson et al. (1990) found a slight increased dopa
accumalation and dopac content in limbic brain areas as
compared to striatum following in vivo administration of
 xxxd162xxx .
the possibility exists that a difference appears if receptor
binding is performed in vivo since kinetic and/or morphologic factors might influence the distribution of the drug.
 xxxd162xxx  invariably competes with 'h- xxxd2419xxx 
binding as well as with 'h-spiroperidol and 'h- xxxd3000xxx 
binding for a variable proportion (1&20%) of non-specific
binding i.e. that binding component remaining by excess of
defining ligand. computerized curve fitting showed that
displaceable non-specific binding significantly influenced
the appropriate determination of the drug affinity and the
slope factor (svartengren & celander 1988). the pharmacologically characterized specific binding for the 5-ht2 (leysen et al. 1982; svartengren & christenson 1985), al
(greengrass & bremner 1979) and d, (seeman 1983) resulted in competition binding curves which were quite steep
(slope factors > 1; data not shown) as analysed by ebda
program, indicating antagonistic and complex interactions
of  xxxd162xxx  with the receptor binding site.
it is known that the cortical 5-ht, receptors are involved
in the formation of inositol-1-phosphate in rat cerebral
cortex (conn & sanders-bush 1984).
thus 5-ht stimulated the formation of 'h-ip, in human
platelets prelabelled with jh-inositol, while 5 pm  xxxd162xxx 
only had a marginal effect when added on its own. the 5-ht
response was effectively inhibited by  xxxd162xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  (table 2). these results indicate that  xxxd162xxx  acts as
an antagonist of this 5-htz receptor-mediated response. the
5-htlc receptor is coupled to inositol-1-phosphate formation as well (conn et al. 1986) but it is unlikely that  xxxd162xxx  exerts its effects through this receptor subtype since the
affinity is very low (haskins et al. 1987). this further
strengthens the evidence in favour of the sht, receptor antagonistic properties of  xxxd162xxx .
