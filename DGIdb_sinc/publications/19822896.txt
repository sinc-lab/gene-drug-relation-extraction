 xxxd2724xxx  has a higher binding affinity and
selectivity for bcr-abl with respect to
imatinib and is an effective treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) after imatinib failure. in a phase 2 study, 73 early
chronic-phase, untreated, phⴙ cml patients, received  xxxd2724xxx  at a dose of
400 mg twice daily. the primary endpoint
was the complete cytogenetic response
(ccgr) rate at 1 year. with a median
follow-up of 15 months, the ccgr rate at

1 year was 96%, and the major molecular
response rate 85%. responses were rapid,
with 78% ccgr and 52% major molecular
response at 3 months. during the first
year, the treatment was interrupted at
least once in 38 patients (52%). the mean
daily dose ranged between 600 and
800 mg in 74% of patients, 400 and 599 mg
in 18% of patients, and was less than
400 mg in 8% of patients. dose interruptions were mainly due to nonhematologic

and biochemical side effects. myelosuppression was irrelevant. one patient progressed to blastic crisis after 6 months;
one went off-treatment for lipase increase
grade 4 (no pancreatitis).  xxxd2724xxx  is safe
and very active in early chronic-phase
cml. these data support a role for  xxxd2724xxx  for the frontline treatment of cml.
this study was registered at clinicaltrials.

introduction
the development of imatinib (im), a small molecule targeting the
protein  xxxg2198xxx  (ptk) that is coded by the bcr-abl
fusion gene on the philadelphia chromosome (ph), has revolutionized the treatment of ph⫹ chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) and has
radically modified the prognosis and the outcome of the disease.1-4
the patients who are treated with im 400 mg daily achieve a
complete cytogenetic response (ccgr) in 65% to 85% of cases,
and a major molecular response (mmolr) in 40% to 60% of cases.
responses are stable, and 5- to 7-year survival free from progression or relapse ranges between 65% and 85%.5-11 however, 15% to
20% of patients are or become resistant to im, and most patients
continue to harbor detectable, though minimal, residual disease.3,4,10,12-17 although mostly in a quiescent state, ph⫹ stem cells
are detectable even in optimal responders, and bcr-abl kinase
domain (kd) point mutations may be also found both in patients
who are protein  xxxg2198xxx  (ptk) inhibitors (ptki) naive
patients, as well as in optimal responders.18-23 other bcr-abl
targeting agents were rapidly developed, such as  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd359xxx , and inno-406,24-28 all having different degrees of
potency and selectivity, and different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.  xxxd2724xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  have already been
registered for the treatment of im-resistant and im-intolerant
patients, to whom they offer a significant therapeutic benefit.29-32
 xxxd2724xxx  is more selective for bcr-abl than any other ptkis.25
moreover, the concentrations of  xxxd2724xxx  that are required to inhibit

the in vitro growth of ph⫹ cells are many fold lower than those
required for im.24-26,28 the mean trough blood concentration of
 xxxd2724xxx  (889 ng/ml, for a dose of 400 mg twice daily) is much
higher than the concentrations required to inhibit the growth of ph⫹
cells carrying most of known bcr-abl kd point mutations, with
the exception of t315.33 the characteristics of these second
generation ptkis are such that they may represent an important
advance also as a frontline therapy. for these reasons, the
gimema cml working party designed and conducted a study of
 xxxd2724xxx  in the frontline therapy of previously untreated, early
chronic-phase ph⫹ cml. a preliminary report of this study was
presented at the 2008 meeting of the american society of
hematology.34

determination of bcr-abl transcript type and level. women who were
breastfeeding, pregnant, or of childbearing potential without a negative
pregnancy test were not enrolled. patients were excluded if their who
performance status was 2 or more, they had other uncontrolled serious
medical conditions, or they had received prior treatment with any investigational agent. the study protocol was approved by the ethic committees of
all participating centers and was conducted in accordance with the
declaration of helsinki. all patients gave written informed consent.
once the screening procedures were completed, all patients were
assigned to receive  xxxd2724xxx  400 mg twice daily, after at least 1 hour of
fasting condition. no dose escalation was allowed. the core trial time was
1 year, during which the treatment was continued at the assigned dose. in
case of adverse events (ae), the dose was adapted, or treatment was
discontinued (table 1). after 1 year of treatment, all patients were allowed
to continue on  xxxd2724xxx .
treatment and response monitoring required a physical examination,
blood counts, and differential and blood chemistry every 15 days for
3 months, then monthly for 1 year, a bone marrow aspirate with cytogenetics after 3, 6, and 12 months, and a quantitative determination of bcr-abl
transcripts level in peripheral blood after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. an
electrocardiogram was required twice during the first month, then at month
2, 3, 5, 7, and 12. an echocardiogram was required at 12 months. all data
were collected through electronic case report forms, but all sites were
monitored directly by trained personnel for data quality and consistency.
definition of phase, risk, and response
the accelerated (ap) and blast phase (bp) were identified according to
european leukemianet criteria.3 in particular, bp was identified by a
percentage of blast cells (ⱖ 30%), or blast cells and promyelocytes
(ⱖ 50%), respectively, or by any extramedullary blast involvement, excluding spleen and liver. the relative risk (rr) was calculated and defined
according to sokal et al35 and hasford et al.36 the hematologic response
(hr) and the cytogenetic response (cgr) were defined according to eln
criteria.3 the molecular response was defined as major (mmolr) if the
bcr-abl:abl ratio was less than 0.10% on the international scale, in

cytogenetic studies were performed by chromosome banding analysis of at least
20 marrow cell metaphases, after short-term culture (24 and/or 48 hours) with
standard g or q banding techniques. if marrow cells could not be obtained, or the
number of metaphases was less than 20, fluorescence in situ hybridization of
interphase cells was performed with bcr-abl extra-signal, dual-color, dualfusion probes (vysis lsi bcr-abl translocation probe; abbott molecular),
counting at least 200 nuclei. the response was classified as complete only when
bcr-abl⫹ nuclei were 0 or 1 (⬍ 1%).38,39
bcr-abl transcript level
bcr-abl transcript level assessment was performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction according to suggested procedures and
recommendations.37,40 abl was used as a control gene. all analyses were
performed on an abi prism 7900 sequence detection system (applied
biosystems). bcr-abl transcripts level was expressed as a percentage
according to the international scale, taking advantage of the ongoing
international initiatives that allow to standardize the quantitation of
bcr-abl transcripts through the use of a conversion factor and consequently to express their results according to the scale.41-43 the lower
detection limit of the assay is 10⫺4. in patients with undetectable (⬍ .0001)
bcr-abl transcript levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction, a nested reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was run
with a lower detection limit of 10⫺6. the reference laboratory that
performed all molecular analyses on this study was located in bologna
(conversion factor, 0.6), and the data were checked and validated (10
samples at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) in orbassano and naples.
statistics
the primary endpoint of the study was the ccgr rate at 1 year. this is a
binary variable in which each patient is classified at 1 year as a ccgr or
not, according to the intention-to-treat principle. based on the expectation
that the ccgr rate after 12 months of standard im treatment would range
between 50% and 70%, and using a fleming single-stage design (62), we
set p0 (as the proportion of responses below which the treatment would be
considered of no interest) at 50% and p1 (as the proportion of responses
above which the treatment would be considered of interest) at 70%. with a
one-side alpha error of 0.025 and a power 1-beta of 90%, the number of
patients to be enrolled was 6544 and was adjusted to 70 to account for
dropouts and withdrawals. no subgroup analysis was planned.

results
a total of 76 patients were screened; 2 patients refused and 1 did
not fit the eligibility criteria because of severe coronary hearth
disease. a total of 73 patients fit the eligibility criteria and were
enrolled over an 8-month period, between june 2007 and february
2008, in 18 gimema clinical centers. this report is based on the
data collected up to april 2009, with a median follow-up of
15 months (range, 12-24 months). main baseline data are reported
in table 2. hematologic and cytogenetic responses are shown in
table 3. the chr rate was 100% at 3 months, 99% at 6 months,
and 97% at 12 months. the ccgr rate was 78% at 3 months, and
96% at 6 and 12 months. only 1 patient so far, who had achieved a
ccgr after 3 months from treatment start, relapsed and progressed
to bp at month 6, with a t315i bcr-abl kd mutation.
the molecular response is shown in figure 1. two patients
achieved a mmolr after 1 month of treatment, and 15 (21%) after
2 months of treatment. the mmolr rate was 52% at 3 months,
66% at 6 months and reached 85% at 12 months, when the median

bcr-abl:abl ratio was 0.006%. at month 12, 9 of 10 patients
not in mmolr had a bcr-abl:abl ratio between 0.1% and

patients (7%) tested negative with nested pcr.
the nonhematologic aes are listed in tables 4 and 5. skin rash,
with pruritus, and bone/muscle/joint pain were more common,
being grade 3 in 5% and 4% of patients (table 4). peripheral edema
was rare, 4% overall and never grade 3. biochemical laboratory
abnormalities were more frequent, particularly bilirubin increase,
53% all grades and 16% grade 3 (table 5). pancreatic enzymes
were increased in 29% (lipase) and 18% (amylase) of patients. no
patient reported clinical symptoms or had any evidence of pancreatitis. lipase elevation reached grade 4 in 3 patients, and one of
these patients discontinued  xxxd2724xxx  after 9 months for this reason.
this patient, who was in ccgr and mmolr at time of  xxxd2724xxx 
discontinuation, is currently on imatinib 400 mg daily, as a
second-line treatment, maintaining the ccgr and the mmolr
(without any evidence of lipase increase). hyperglycemia was not
frequent, 12% all grades and 3% grade 3; all the episodes of
hyperglycemia were transitory and clinically irrelevant. anemia,

overall, the number of patients with at least one ae grade 3/4 was 5 (7%), and
the number of patients with at least on ae grade 2, 3, or 4, was 21 (29%). all the
hematologic aes were identified during the first quarter of therapy. their identification
was based on 431 blood counts which were due out of 438 counts (per protocol,
blood counts and differentials were due every 15 days during the first quarter). the
frequency of all grade 3/4 aes reported in 280 cp patients who were treated with
 xxxd2724xxx  second line32 was higher (29% neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, 10%
anemia).

neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were exceedingly rare (table
6), and this was confirmed by the careful review of all blood counts
and differentials that were due every 2 weeks during the first
quarter of therapy.
biochemical laboratory abnormalities and, less frequently,
nonhematologic aes, led to temporary dose interruption in 38 patients (52%; table 7). the median cumulative duration of dose
interruptions was 19 days (range, 3-169 days). overall, 74% of
patients received a mean daily dose ranging between 600 and
800 mg, while 16% of patients received 400 to 600 mg and 8% less
than 400 mg. all 584 electrocardiograms were checked and
reviewed; transient and clinically irrelevant abnormalities were
noticed in 16 patients (22%). in 2 patients, the duration of qtc was
prolonged to more than 450 msec, but in no case was qtc longer
than 500 msec.
no subgroup analysis had been planned, and no subgroup
analysis was possible, also because of the high response rate.
however, it may be noted that the ccgr rate of the 10 high-sokalrisk patients was 50% at 3 months and that the only one patient who
failed and developed bp was high risk. it should also be noted that
5 patients took a mean daily dose of less than 400 mg in the first
quarter of therapy and that at the end of this quarter “only” 2 of
them were in ccgr, while 1 was in pcgr and 2 were in less than
pcgr. however, after 12 months of therapy, all these 5 patients
were in ccgr.

discussion
this study provides important new information on the early
therapeutic effects of  xxxd2724xxx , 400 mg twice daily, in previously
untreated, early chronic phase ph⫹ cml patients. the results are
straightforward, because after 1 year of treatment all but 2 patients
were in ccgr and 62 of 73 patients (85%) were in mmolr. only
1 patient discontinued the treatment due to an ae (persistent and
recurrent lipase elevation grade 3/4, without any clinical conse-

quence), and only 1 patient failed. moreover, it was shown that
both the cgr and the molr were achieved very rapidly, with 78%
of patients already in ccgr and 52% of patients already in
mmolr, after only 3 months of therapy. all these responses were
durable through study duration.
a high and rapid response rate was not unexpected, because
the phase-2 studies had already shown that in im-resistant, late
chronic-phase patients with  xxxd2724xxx  a major (complete plus
partial) cgr could be achieved in approximately 50% of patients
and that the median time to response was less than 3 months.32,45
however, the magnitude and rapidity of the response in this
frontline study of  xxxd2724xxx  was greater than expected. it cannot be
explained by a single-center effect, because the patients were
enrolled competitively in 18 clinical centers. however, all centers
were experienced in the management of cml with ptkis,
including  xxxd2724xxx  second-line. it should also be noted that patients
distribution by risk was shifted, in that the proportion of high-risk
patients was less than expected. this was likely due to chance, as a
result of the relatively low number of patients enrolled because no
selection occurred. high-risk (sokal) patients were 10; one of them
progressed to bp, and the remaining 9 were in ccgr at 12 months.
an independent, single-center study of  xxxd2724xxx  frontline in ecp
cml has provided similar cytogenetic response rates.46
 xxxd2724xxx  is more potent and more selective toward bcr-abl
than im.24-28 the mean trough blood level that is achieved with
400 mg twice daily is many fold higher than the concentration that
is required to inhibit the growth of 50% of cultured ph⫹ cells,
wild-type or mutated.33 the flux of  xxxd2724xxx  into cml cells is not
dependent upon transporter proteins, as in the case of im.47,48
therefore, although a single-arm study of a relatively small number
of patients cannot yet provide sufficient evidence and cannot allow
comparisons with other therapies, the results are such that they raise
the legitimate expectation that a prospective randomized study of
 xxxd2724xxx  versus im may confirm that in the short-term  xxxd2724xxx  is
superior to im. one such study is ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov
nct00471497). a superiority of  xxxd2724xxx  in the short term could
contribute to a better long-term outcome, because on im therapy, most
failures occur during the first 3 years of treatment.7-9
in this study, the frequency and the degree of nonhematologic
and biochemical aes was as expected from phase 2 studies,32,45
with few minor and irrelevant differences (tables 4 and 5), which
may be easily explained by the fact that all patients were in ecp
and previously untreated. only grade 3/4 hyperglycemia and
hypophosphatemia were significantly less frequent than previously
reported32,45 (3% vs 12% and 3% vs 15%, respectively; table 5).
most dose discontinuations, interruptions, and reductions were
guided either by clinically relevant side effects, mainly skin and
bone-muscle-joint pain, or more frequently by clinically uneventful

the percentage of patients who received a different cumulative median daily dose of  xxxd2724xxx  in the first quarter, in the second quarter, in the second half, and overall is
shown. at 12 months, the number of patients receiving the full dose of 800 mg daily was 51 (71%), the number of patients with a permanent dose reduction to 400 mg was
18 (25%), and the number of patients receiving less than 400 mg was 3 (4%).

 xxxd2724xxx  for the frontline treatment of ph⫹ cml

biochemical abnormalities, mainly bilirubin and pancreatic enzymes elevation. we were surprised that the degree of hematopoietic toxicity (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) was
lower than expected from the earlier results of phase 2 studies32,45
(table 6). the rarity of hematologic aes may be explained again
by the fact that all patients were previously untreated and in ecp.
we also think that the dose interruptions and reductions, which
were due to biochemical abnormalities, prevented the occurrence
of hematologic toxicity. as a matter of fact, the treatment was
interrupted at least once in 52% of patients, and 26% of patients
took a mean daily dose lower than 600 mg. because all patients but
2 achieved a ccgr, the question may be asked if a dose of 400 mg
twice daily is necessary, suggesting to explore if a lower dose can
be as effective and more easily manageable, particularly in lowrisk patients.
we conclude that  xxxd2724xxx  400 mg twice daily is safe and highly
effective, in ecp, previously untreated ph⫹ cml patients, provided that the dose is properly adjusted to account for nonhematologic and biochemical side effects. the results obtained within the
frame of a controlled trial need confirmation in the clinical practice.
the response rates are such that  xxxd2724xxx  is expected to be more
effective and more rapid than im in the short term. because it has
been shown that with im most primary and secondary failures
occur during the first 2 years of therapy,7-9 it is possible that a more
rapid response may help to reduce failures and also improve the
late outcome of therapy.
