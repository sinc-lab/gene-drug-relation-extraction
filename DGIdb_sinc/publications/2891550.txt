using radioligand binding techniques and human frontal cortex, we determined the equilibrium dissociation
constants (kds) of 17 neuroleptics at the serotonin 5-htia and serotonin 5-ht2 receptors with [3h]wb4101 and
[3h] xxxd2419xxx , respectively. at the serotonin 5-htaa receptor, the most and least potent neuroleptics were  xxxd1679xxx  (k d = 230 nm) and fluphenazine (kd = 40 #m), respectively. at the serotonin  xxxg1113xxx , the most
and least potent neuroleptics were spiperone (k d = 0.38 nm) and molindone, (k d = 5/am), respectively.

1. introduction

psychotherapeutic drugs antagonize m a n y different receptors in the central nervous system.
this antagonism m a y explain a drug's therapeutic
and adverse effects as well as its interactions with
other drugs. in addition, there appears to be a
relationship between a drug's receptor affinity (or
its reciprocal, the equilibrium dissociation constant) and its potency or likelihood of causing an
effect. specifically for neuroleptics, there is a
strong correlation between dopamine d-2 receptor
affinity and daily dose for treating schizophrenia
(richelson and nelson, 1984b).
the radioligand binding assay is presently the
method of choice in assessing a drug's affinity for
certain receptors. most assays of this type have
utilized animal brain tissue, and some investigators have found good correlations between these
results and those obtained with the use of h u m a n
brain tissue (richelson and nelson, 1984a, b;
fowler, 1986). because there are examples of dif* to whom all correspondence should be addressed: guggenheim 7, mayo foundation, rochester, mn 55905, u.s.a.

ferences in results between species (pazos et al.,
1984; schnellmann et al., 1984), we have routinely
used human brain tissue in our radioligand binding studies, and here we report the dissociation
constants (kds) of 17 neuroleptics at the serotonin
5-htia and 5-ht 2 receptors of h u m a n brain.

2. materials and methods
2.1. tissue preparation

h u m a n brain tissue was obtained at the time of
autopsy (range 1.3-12.5 h after death) from donors
with no known history of neuropsychiatric illness.
cardiovascular events were responsible for death
in all five donors: myocardial infarction in two
and cardiac dysrhythmia, ruptured thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm, and pulmonary embolism in the others. specimens appeared grossly
normal. tissue was stored in a liquid nitrogen
refrigerator until its use. g r a y matter was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice cold buffer using a
brinkmann polytron pt-45 (45 s, setting 8). the
buffer used for the serotonin 5-htaa assays was

50 mm tris hc1 (ph 7.7 at 25 o c) containing 5
mm  xxxd2534xxx  and 0.5 mm edta, and that used
for the serotonin 5-ht2 assays was 50 mm tris
hc1 (ph 7.7 at 25°c). the homogenate was
centrifuged at 38 000 × g for 10 rain. the pellets
were resuspended in buffer to give 30 and 10 mg
initial wet weight/ml for the serotonin 5-htia
and 5-ht2 assays, respectively. aliquots of homogenate were stored at -33 ° c.

2.2. receptor assays
into glass culture tubes (12 x 75 mm) were
placed the tritiated ligand (0.05 ml), drug solution,
and buffer. for the serotonin 5-htaa assays, 0.10
ml of 9 gm  xxxd3000xxx  was also added to each tube.
the solution was stirred using a vortex mixer.
homogenate (0.25 ml) was added to each tube,
and the suspension (1.0 rnl) was again stirred
using a vortex mixer. the final concentration of
each radioligand was 0.51 and 0.26 nm for the
serotonin 5-ht1a ([3h]wb4101) and 5-ht2
([3h] xxxd2419xxx ) assays, respectively. duplicate
samples were incubated at 37 °c for 1 h and the
suspensions were then filtered under vacuum using
whatman g f / b filter strips on a brandel m-24 r
cell harvester. the tubes and filters were rinsed
with 3 x 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. the filter circles
were placed in 6 ml plastic mini-vials (research
products international) and 4 ml scintillation fluid
(safety solve, research products international)
was added to each. after the tubes stood 5 h, the
radioactivity was measured using either a searle
isocap 300 or a beckman ls 7800 liquid scintillation counter at an efficiency of 30 and 42%, respe~..tively~ispecific binding was defined as total

3. results

3.1. serotonin 5-htia receptor of human frontal
cortex
although [3h]wb4101 has been considered to
label al-adrenoceptors, it has been shown that this
radioligand may be used to label the serotonin
5-i-it1 (probably, 5-ht1a) site under certain experimental conditions (norman et al., 1985). because [3h]wb4101 has high affinity for al-adrenergic sites,  xxxd3000xxx  (900 nm), a potent and selective al-adrenoceptor antagonist, was used in each
assay to block its binding to these receptors. binding to serotonin 5-htia receptors was rapid, reached steady state within several min and

maintained this level of binding for at least 1 h.
competition experiments revealed that wb4101
possessed a k d + s.e.m. equal to 3.1 + 0.3 nm
(n = 29), which is similar to that (3.8 nm) reported
using rat cortical homogenates (norman et al.,
1985). the hill coefficient did not differ significantly from unity, indicating that the compound
bound to a single class of receptor sites under
these conditions.
of the 17 neuroleptics studied at the 5-ht~a
receptor,  xxxd1679xxx  was the most potent with
a k d = 230 ___20 nm and a hill coefficient essentially equal to unity (table 1). the weakest binding
was exhibited by fluphenazine, with a k d = 40 +
10 btm. n o correlation existed between the log of
the kds and the log of the average daily doses for
treating schizophrenia (r = 0.15, p = 0.58).

et al., 1982).  xxxd2419xxx  had a k d = 0.56 + 0.04
n m (n = 29), which is comparable to previous
studies by leysen et al. (1982) using rat prefrontal
cortex ( k d = 0.42 nm). hill coefficients for
 xxxd2419xxx  and the neuroleptics were essentially
equal to one (table 2), indicating binding to a
single population of receptor sites.
kds for the 17 neuroleptics were relatively low
(table 2), and spiperone (k d = 0.38 + 0.05 nm),
d-butaclamol (k d = 0.4 + 0.1 nm) and  xxxd1679xxx  (k d = 0.43 _ 0.08 nm) all b o u n d m o r e
strongly than  xxxd2419xxx . molindone had a k d =
5 + 1 #m, which was greatly different from the
values for the other compounds. again, no correlation existed between the log of the kds and the
log of the average daily doses (r = 0.097, p = 0.71).

4. discussion
here we have presented the data for 17 neuroleptics binding at the serotonin 5 - h t 1 (probably,
5-htia ) and 5 - h t 2 receptors present in n o r m a l
h u m a n brain frontal cortex. f o r these compounds,
there was no significant correlation between the
log of their kds at the  xxxg1108xxx  and the
log of their kds at the 5 - h t 2 receptor. however,
all but one c o m p o u n d , molindone, b o u n d m o r e
potently to the 5 - h t 2 receptor (table 2).
we c o m p a r e d our data for six c o m p o u n d s in
c o m m o n with the study of leysen et al. (1982)
who also used [3h] xxxd2419xxx  as a radioligand but
used rat prefrontal cortex. a significant correlation (r = 0.98, p = 0.0005) existed between the two
sets of data. we have cited in this paper other
comparisons between our results and those of
others using animal brain. these comparisons suggest that there are no large species differences
between h u m a n and animal brain serotonin receptors, although pazos et al. (1984) reported species
differences for mesulergine, an apparently selective serotonin 5 - h t 2 ligand.
the clinical relevance of serotonin receptor

blockade b y neuroleptics is unknown. certainly,
the lack of correlation between receptor affinity
and neurleptic dose indicates that serotonin receptor blockade alone does not explain the m o d e of
action of these drugs. however, vascular side-effects of these c o m p o u n d s m a y be mediated by
blockade of serotonin receptors (peroutka, 1984).
