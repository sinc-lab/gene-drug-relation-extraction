abstract: the widely clinically used benzothiadiazines and high ceiling diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide,  xxxd2297xxx ,
 xxxd3066xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx ,  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide and bumetanide, contain so2nh2 moieties acting as an effective zincbinding function in carbonic anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) inhibitors. these drugs were launched in a period when only isoform ca ii
was known and considered physiologically/pharmacologically relevant. although acting as moderate-weak inhibitors of ca ii, all these
drugs considerably inhibit other ca isozymes known nowadays to be involved in critical physiologic processes, among the 16 cas present in vertebrates. some low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against such isoforms were recently detected, such as metholazone against ca vii, xii and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  against ca vb, vii, ix, xii and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii and xiii,
furosemide against ca i, ii and xiv, and  xxxd381xxx  against ca ix and xii. the x-ray crystal structure of the ca ii –  xxxd2343xxx  adduct was also reported recently, revealing interesting aspects useful for the drug design of ca inhibitors. it has also been proposed that
the recently observed beneficial effect of  xxxd2343xxx  for the treatment of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes might be due to
its potent inhibition of ca isoforms present in kidneys and blood vessels, which would thus explain both the blood pressure lowering effects as well as organ-protective activity of the drug. thus, these old drugs may be useful as leads for new applications.

introduction
acetazolamide ( xxxd63xxx )
1, is a potent but promiscuous inhibitor of the ubiquitous metalloenzymes carbonic anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) and was the first
non-mercurial diuretic to be used clinically, already in 1956 [1,2].
acetazolamide represents the prototype of a class of pharmacological agents with apparently limited therapeutic usefulness nowadays,
but which played a major role in the development of fundamental
renal physiology and pharmacology, as well as for the design of
many of the presently widely used diuretic agents, such as among
others the thiazide and high ceiling diuretics [1-6]. in mammals, 16
different -ca isozymes or ca-related proteins (carp) were described so far, with very different catalytic activity, subcellular
localization, tissue distribution and susceptibility to be inhibited by
sulfonamides [1-5,7,8]. these enzymes catalyze a very simple
physiological reaction, the interconversion between carbon dioxide
and the bicarbonate ion, and are thus involved in crucial physiological processes connected with respiration and transport of
co2/bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues and lungs, ph and
co2 homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/
organs, biosynthetic reactions (such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis
and ureagenesis), bone resorption, calcification, tumorigenicity, and
many other physiologic/pathologic processes [1-5,7,8] cas are
highly abundant in the kidneys (a total concentration of about 8 –
10 mum has been estimated for this organ), and many isoforms have
been shown to be present in various tissues of this organ [9,10]. ca
isoforms present in kidneys, such as ca ii, iv, vb, ix, xii and
xiv play a crucial function in at least three physiological processes: (i) the acid-base balance homeostasis (by secreting and excreting protons, due to the carbon dioxide hydration reaction catalysed by these enzymes); (ii) the bicarbonate reabsorption processes, and (iii) and the renal nh4+ output [2,11,12]. these important functions are well localised in the different segments of the
nephron: bicarbonate reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule,
whereas urinary acidification and nh4+ output in the distal tubule
and collecting duct [2,11,12]. following the administration of a

ca inhibitor (cai), such as acetazolamide 1, the urine volume
promptly increases, and its normally acidic ph (of 6) becomes alkaline (around 8.2) [2,10-12]. an increased amount of bicarbonate is
eliminated into the urine (120 times higher than the amount eliminated normally), together with na+, and k+ as accompanying
cations, whereas the amount of chloride excreted is diminished. the
increased alkalinity of the urine is accompanied by a decrease in the
excretion of titratable acid and ammonia, and in consequence by
metabolic acidosis. this sequence of events is due to the inhibition
of various ca isozymes in the proximal tubule, which leads to inhibition of h+ secretion by this segment of the nephron. inhibition
of both cytosolic (ca ii) as well as membrane-bound (ca iv and
ca xiv) enzymes seems to be involved in the diuretic effects of
the sulfonamides [2,11,12]. inhibition of such cas decreases the
availability of protons for the na+ – h+ antiporter, which maintains
a low proton concentration in the cell. the net effect of these processes is the transport of sodium bicarbonate from the tubular lumen
to the interstitial space, followed by movement of the isotonically
obligated water, and whence augmented diuresis. cais also increase phosphate excretion (by an unknown mechanism) but have
little or no effect on the excretion of calcium or  xxxd2531xxx 
[2,11,12].
acetazolamide 1, and structurally related sulfonamides, such as
 xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3 and  xxxd1872xxx  4 were
and are still used for the treatment of edema due to congestive heart
failure, and for drug-induced edema, in addition to their applications as antiglaucoma agents [1,2,11]. however, these systemic
cais generally produce many undesired side effects due to inhibition of cas present in other organs than the kidneys [1,2]. the
structurally related compound to acetazolamide,  xxxd307xxx  5,
with a quite acidic pka of 3.2 for the secondary sulfonamide group
is completely ionised at the physiological ph, as sulfonamidate
anion [11]. its renal effect on bicarbonate excretion is around 10
times as potent as that of acetazolamide, the drug being maximally
active at doses of 1 mg/kg, and being actively and rapidly accumulated in the kidney, but its plasma half-life is of only 20 min [11].
all these facts make  xxxd307xxx  a renal specific cai, but the
compound remained an orphan drug and has not been developed for
wide clinical use, due to its inappropriate pharmacokinetics, although some annecdotical reports indicate that it might be beneficial for patients suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease
[1,11].

tor of hca i, iv and vi (kis in the range of 2.84 – 8.25 mum) and
shows very weak inhibition against siozymes hca iii, va and xiii
(kis of 10.2 – 870 mum). it is already apparent that even small structural changes in the benzothiadiazine scaffold, such as the substitution of the chlorine atom in ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety by a
trifluoromethyl group, such as in the pair 6a/6b, has dramatic consequences for the ca inhibitory properties of the two compounds,
basically against all investigated ca isozymes (table 1). (iii)
 xxxd3066xxx  7 is the only diuretic among compounds 1-12 investigated here which is not approved for clinical use in europe (but it
is approved in usa) [6,11] and this derivative was not available to
be investigated here. literature data [6] show it to be a very weak
hca i and a modest hca ii inhibitor, with inhibition constants in
the range of 1.26 – 35 mum (table 1). (iv)  xxxd2627xxx  8 shows very
weak hca i and iii inhibitory properties (kis in the range of 54 –
610 mum), being a low micromolar inhibitor (thus, not a very efficient one) of hca ii, vi and xiv, with inhibition constants in the
range of 1.714 – 5.432 mum. however, the drug is a medium potency
inhibitor of isozymes hca iv, va, vb and ix (k is in the range of
216 – 750 nm) and a very efficient one against hca vii, hca xii
and mca xiii (kis in the range of 2.1 – 15 nm). (v)  xxxd1680xxx 
9 also shows a very interesting inhibition profile, acting as a weak
hca iii inhibitor (with a ki of 11 mum, this compound is one of the
most effective hca iii inhibitors ever detected among all know
sulfonamides except trifluoromethanesulfonamide which has a ki
of 0.9 mum) [3,16] and a rather weak hca vi and hca xiv inhibitor (kis in the range of 1.347 – 4.95 mum).  xxxd1680xxx  is a moderate hca va inhibitor (ki of 917 nm) and an effective, or very
effective inhibitor of the other mammalian ca isozymes. thus, the
ubuiquitous hca i and ii, as well as hca iv, show inhibition constants in the range of 138 – 348 nm, but isoforms vb, vii, ix, xii
and xiii are inhibited in the low nanomolar range (kis in the range
of 2.8 – 23 nm). these results showing 9 to be such a strong cai
against many isoforms are quite unexpected, and considering the
wide clinical use of the compound for the treatment of hypertension
[17] at least two issues can be raised: is the inhibition of these ca
isozymes responsible for some of the therapeutic effects of the drug
(or for some side effects observed with it), and, secondly, can these
observations be useful for the design of cais with increased selectivity for some ca isoforms or for envisaging novel therapeutic
applications of the drug (e.g, an an adjuvant to antitumor therapies,

using acetazolamide 1 as lead, a large number of other quite
successful sulfonamide diuretics were developed in the 60s and 70s,
such as the benzothiadiazines 6 (hydrochlorothiazide 6a,  xxxd2297xxx  6b and the like),  xxxd3066xxx  7,  xxxd2627xxx  8,
 xxxd1680xxx  9,  xxxd2343xxx  10, furosemide 11 and bumetanide 12
[1-3]. some of them are among the most widely clinically used
diuretics [6,11,13,14] and as they all possess primary so2nh2
moieties, acting as excellent zinc-binding groups for the metal ion
present within the ca active site [1-3], it is to be expected that they
should also have ca inhibitory properties. however, this issue has
been investigated only in the 60s or 70s when these drugs were
launched, and when only one ca isozyme (i.e., ca ii) was presumed to exist and be responsible for all the physiologic effects of
the sulfonamide drugs [11]. the interaction of some of these clinically used diuretics with all 12 catalytically active mammalian ca
isoforms was reinvestigated recently [15] the x-ray crystal structure
of one of them ( xxxd2343xxx  10) in complex with ca ii was also
reported [15]. such data are highly useful for the design of novel
classses of more isozyme-selective cais and most importantly, to
understand some new pharmacological effects of these old drugs.
sulfonamide diuretics as carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors
in table 1, the inhibition data of the 12 mammalian catalytically active cas with drugs 1-12 are shown [15]. these data show
that similarly to the clinically used/orphan drug classical sulfonamide cais, i.e., compounds 1-5, the clinically used diuretics 6-12
also act as inhibitors of all twelve investigated ca isozymes, but
with an inhibition profile quite different from that of inhibitors
investigated earlier, and particularly different from that of sulfonamides 1-5. the following should be noted from these inhibition
data. (i) hydrochlorothiazide 6a acts as a medium potency inhibitor
of isoforms hca i, ii, vb, ix and xii, with inhibition constants in
the range of 290 – 603 nm, the compound being a weaker inhibitor
of isoforms hca va, vi, vii, xiii and xiv (k is in the range of
3.655 – 5.010 mum) and an exceedingly weak one against hca iii
(ki of 0.79 mm). (ii)  xxxd2297xxx  6b shows an inhibition
profile quite distinct from that of the closely structurally related
diuretic 6a, being a rather efficient inhibitor of the following isoforms hca ii, vb, vii, ix, xii and xiv, with inhibition constants
in the range of 305 – 435 nm. this sulfonamide is a weaker inhibitable 1.

inhibition data with some of the clinically used sulfonamides 1-12 against isozymes i – xiv (the isoforms ca viii, x and xi are devoid of catalytic activity and probably do not bind sulfonamides as they do not contain zn(ii) ions) [1,2]

considering its strong inhibitory effects against the tumor-associated ca isozymes ix and xii) [18]? we shall reply to some of these
questions after considering in detail the inhibition profile of the
remaining three drugs. (vi)  xxxd2343xxx  10 acts as an inefficient ca
i and iii inhibitor (k is in the range of 51.9 – 230 mum), is a weak
inhibitor of isoforms ca ii, va, vi, and xiv (kis in the range of
890 – 4950 nm) but shows significant inhibitory activity against
ca iv and vb (k is in the range of 213 – 274 nm) and excellent
inhibition of ca vii, ix, xii and xiii, with inhibition constants in

the low nanomolar range (kis in of 0.23 – 36 nm). these data are
indeed remarkable, also considering the wide use of the drug as
diuretic and its beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, as recently reported in an important clinical trial [13,14].
(vii) furosemide 11 acts as a very weak hca iii inhibitor (ki of
3200 mum), but it shows moderate inhibitory activity against many
isoforms, such as ca iv, va, vb, vi, vii, ix, xii and xiii, with
kis in the range of 261 – 564 nm. the compound is on the other
hand a much better inhibitor of ca i, ii and xiv, with kis in the

range of 52 – 65 nm. (viii)  xxxd381xxx  is again an extremely
weak hca iii inhibitor (k i of 3400 mum), similarly to furosemide
with which it is structurally related. however,  xxxd381xxx  is also a
weak inhibitor of hca i, ii and xiii (kis in the range of 2570 –
6980 nm), probably due to the quite bulky phenoxy moiety in ortho
to the sulfamoyl zinc-binding group. the compound shows better
inhibitory activity against isoforms ca iv, va and xiv (k is in the
range of 250 – 700 nm) but excellent inhibition of the tumorassociated isoforms ca ix and xii (kis in the range of 21.1 – 25.8
nm, i.e., the same order of magnitude as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2 or  xxxd2058xxx  3). thus, it may be observed that  xxxd381xxx  is an effective inhibitor of only the tumor-associated
isoforms ca ix and xii, discriminating thus between these drug
targets [18] and other ca isoforms that should not be inhibited by a
cancer-specific cai.
binding of  xxxd2343xxx  to human  xxxg293xxx 
in order to understand at molecular level the interactions between  xxxd2343xxx  10 and the active site of a ca isozyme, the x-ray
crystal structure of the  xxxd2343xxx  adduct with the ubiquitous,
highly investigated isoform hca ii was reported [15]. interactions
between the protein and zn2+ ion were entirely preserved in the
adduct, as in all other hca ii – sulfonamide/sulfamate/sulfamide
complexes investigated so far [19-24]. a compact binding between
the inhibitor and the enzyme active site was observed, similarly
with what reported earlier for other such complexes, with the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+ binding site and the key hydrogen
bonds between the so2nh2 moiety of the inhibitor and enzyme
active site all retained (figs. 1 and 2) [19-24]. thus, the ionized
nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide group of 10 is coordinated to the
zinc ion at a distance of 2.15 å, (table 3). this nitrogen was also
hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of thr199 (n--thr199og=2.86 å), which in turn interacted with the glu106oe1
atom (2.5 å, data not shown). one oxygen atom of the sulfonamide
moiety was 3.06 å away from the catalytic zn2+ ion, being considered as weakly coordinated to the metal ion, whereas the second

one participated in a hydrogen bond (of 3.19 å) with the backbone
amide group of thr199 [19-24]. his64 (in its in conformation)
made strong van der waals contacts (< 4 å) with the conh moiety
of the inhibitor, but these interactions cannot actually be considered
as hydrogen bonds). a very strong interaction was on the other
hand the offset face-to-face stacking between the annulated orthophenylene moiety of  xxxd1171xxx  and the phenyl group of phe131
(figs. 1 and 2), which has been observed previously for several
other adducts of hca ii with sulfonamides such as the pyridinium
derivative 13 [8] and sulpiride 14 [23]. such a stacking interaction

bound within the hca ii active site. active site residues coordinating the
metal ion (his94, 96, 119) as well as those involved in the binding of the
inhibitor (his64, phe131 and thr199) are shown [15].

hibitors between the three compounds. thus, whereas 13 is a very
strong hca ii inhibitor (ki of 21 nm), sulpiride 14 is a slightly
weaker one (k i of 40 nm) whereas 10 is a moderate-weak inhibitor
(ki of 2.52 mum, table 1). however, we consider this as a quite
positive and interesting feature of  xxxd2343xxx  as a cai (as discussed above), which might be used to design compounds with
reduced affinity for the ubiquitous, house-keeping enzyme hca ii,
but strong inhibitory properties against other isoforms, such as hca
iv, vb, vii, ix, xii or xiii, against which  xxxd2343xxx  act as a
much more efficient cai (table 1).

was in fact demonstrated to be highly important for the orientation
of the inhibitor within the active site and for the potency of a sulfonamide as cai against this isoform [8] thus, in order to better
understand the binding of 10 to hca ii, the superpositions of its
hca ii adduct with those of  xxxd1872xxx  4 [24] as well as
those of sulfonamides 13 [8] and 14 [23] are shown in fig. (3). two
facts can be observed. first, a quite peculiar orientation for the
phenyl ring of inhibitors 4 and 10 bound within the enzyme active
site may be observed with respect to that of other benzenesulfonamides whose structures in complex with hca ii have been
reported (fig. 3a) [19-24]. it may be seen that the plane of the
phenyl moiety of the benzene-1,3-disulfonamide 4 and of  xxxd2343xxx  10 appears clearly rotated by almost 30° and tilted by approximately 10° with respect to its most recurrent orientation, as the
one of derivatives 13 and 14 (fig. 3b and 3c). this peculiar conformation may be ascribed to the presence of the secondary sulfonamide group in the meta position of 4, and the corresponding
bulky carbohydrazide substituent in the meta position to the sulfamoyl moiety of 10, which probably orient the entire molecule in
this unusual conformation, when bound within the enzyme cavity.
in addition, both these cais (i.e., 4 and 10) possess a chlorine atom
in ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety coordinated to the zn(ii) present in
the enzyme cavity, which could also influence the orientation of the
organic scaffold due to steric impairment in the rather restricted
environment near the metal ion [24]. in fact, fig. (3a) shows that
the sulfamoyl-chloro-phenyl fragment present in the scaffold of
inhibitors 4 and 10 is practically completely superposable in these
two hca ii – sulfonamide complexes, whereas the second sulfamoyl group of  xxxd1872xxx  4 binds in the same active site
region as the much bulkier carbohydrazide moiety of  xxxd2343xxx 
10 (fig. 3a). the second feature which is salient for the adduct of
10 with hca ii regards the stacking interaction in which phe131
participate with the phenylene moiety of the bicyclic ring present in
 xxxd2343xxx . as seen from figs. (1-3), the two rings, i.e., the orthophenylene moiety of the  xxxd1171xxx  and the phenyl group of
phe131 are strictly parallel to each other, being at a distance of 3.41
– 3.46 å. the same stacking has been previously evidenced between the phenyl moiety of phe131 and the 2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium ring of the positively-charged sulfonamide 13 [8], or the same
phenyl moiety and the n-ethyl-pyrrolidine group of sulpiride 14
[23]. in both these complexes this stacking interaction has been one
of the main factors assuring a strong affinity of the inhibitor for the
hca ii active site. as seen from figs. (4b and 4c), although the
phenylene moiety of 10 binds in the same active site region as the
trimethylpyridinium ring of the positively-charged sulfonamide 13,
and the n-ethyl-pyrrolidine group of sulpiride 14, these three cyclic
moieties are not very well superposable with each other, which in
part probably explain the net difference of activities as hca ii in-

potential novel applications of the diuretic
sulfonamides in therapy
but what is the relevance of the above mentioned findings for
the drug design of cais with diverse pharmacological applications
? we think that there are at least several aspects that need to be
considered for answering this question. first, the classical sulfonamide diuretics 6-12 (widely used drugs to treat hypertension [1315]) were considered till recently to be inactive as cais, due to the
fact that they were launched in a period when only ca ii was well
known (and considered as responsible of all physiologic effects of
cais). it may indeed be observed that in contrast to the classical
cais of type 1-5 (generally low nanomolar ca ii inhibitors), all
compounds 6-12 (except furosemide 11) are much weaker inhibitors of this isozyme, usually in the micromolar range. indeed, only
furosemide 11 is a good ca ii inhibitor among these diuretics, with
a ki of 65 nm, whereas all others show kis in the range of 138 –
6980 nm (table 1). again with the exception of furosemide 11, the
diuretics 6-12 have low affinity for ca i, the other isoform known
when these drugs have been discovered. however, data of table 1
show that many of the drugs 6-12 appreciably inhibit cas discovered after their introduction in clinical use, with some low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against many of them. examples of such situations, are among others: metholazone 8 against
ca vii, xii and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  9 against ca vb, vii, ix, xii
and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  10 against ca vii, ix, xii and xiii, furosemide 11 against ca i, ii and xiv, and  xxxd381xxx  12 against
ca ix and xii among others (table 1). as already mentioned
above,  xxxd381xxx  12 is a tumor-specific (targeting ca ix and
xii) cai, of equal potency to acetazolamide 1, but without the
promiscuity of acetazolamide which is a potent cai against most
mammalina isozymes. indeed,  xxxd381xxx  is a weak inhibitor of
all other isoforms except ca ix and xii, which are overexpressed
in tumors [18].  xxxd2343xxx  10 and  xxxd1680xxx  9 are also strong
inhibitors of the tumor-associated cas, but they are also effective
in inhibiting ca vii and xiii too (table 1). it is thus clear, that
these old drugs may indeed have newer applications in therapy or as
experimental agents, in situations in which the selective inhibition
of some ca isozymes is needed, and which cannot be obtained with
the presently used compunds of types 1-5.
a second important aspect of these findings is whether we can
explain some recent observations of clinical trials in which such
diuretic agents have been employed, and how this is reflected in the
drug design process. thus, a relevant question arising is: how these
inhibitory activities of compounds of type 6-12 against ca isoforms known nowadays to play important physiological functions
[1-8], is reflected by the pharmacologic effects (or side effects profile) of these drugs ? it is in fact known that many interesting
classes of novel drugs have been discovered just by observing side
effects of some clinically used agents [1-3]. recently it has been
observed that  xxxd2343xxx  10 in combination with an ace inhibitor
(as diuretics) are highly beneficial for the treatment of patients with
hypertension and type 2 diabetes [13,14]. treatment with  xxxd2343xxx  was also shown to lead to a significant decrease of plasma
adiponectin concentration in patients with essential hypertension
[14]. adiponectin is considered to participate in the pathogenesis of
carbohydrate metabolism disturbances often found in patients
treated with other thiazide-type diuretics [14]. on the other hand,

diuretics

classical sulfonamide cais such as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2  xxxd2058xxx  3, and other compounds possessing such
properties, are known to induce vasodilation in a variety of tissues
and organs, including the kidneys, eye vasculature, brain vessels,
etc. [25-30]. however, the exact mechanisms by which they produce this beneficial effect for many pathologies (e.g., hypertension,
glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, etc), or the isoforms involved in it,
are unknown for the moment [25-30]. in line with these studies [2530], a very recent report shows that  xxxd2343xxx  10 has a protective
role against ischemia-induced injury and dysfunction of the bloodbrain barrier, probably due to its vasodilating effects [31,32]. an
organ-protective effect of  xxxd2343xxx  in animal models of renal
failure has also been reported, showing the drug to be beneficial in
preventing damage to the capillary structures, the endothelium, and
in reducing the hypertrophy of superficial glomeruli among others
[13,14,33]. all these effects are probably mediated by inhibition of
cas present in blood vessels or in the kidneys, but no specific
pharmacologic or biochemical studies are available so far, except
for these clinical observations mentioned here [13,14,28-33]. the
lesson we learned from all these data is that probably many of the
recently reported beneficial clinical properties of  xxxd2343xxx  10 are
due indeed to its diuretic effects, but in conjuction with its strong
inhibition of some ca isozymes (such as ca iv, vb, vii, ix, xii
and/or xiii) reported here for the first time, isoforms present in
kidneys and blood vessels. this hypothesis may explain both the
blood pressure lowering effects as well as organ-protective activity
of the drug. for medicinal chemists this means that probably it is
possible to design sulfonamide cais possessing an inhibition profile similar to 10, but with a stronger activity against the target isoform(s) involved in these pathologies, provided that it will be possible to understand which these isozymes are.
conclusions
the widely used sulfonamide drugs, the benzothiadiazines and
high ceiling diuretics, among which hydrochlorothiazide,  xxxd2297xxx ,  xxxd3066xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx ,  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide and bumetanide, which contain primary sulfamoyl moieties acting as potential zinc-binding functions, were recently investigated as inhibitors of 12 catalytically active mammalian cas. these widely used drugs were launched in a period when
only isoform ca ii was known and considered physiologically/
pharmacologically relevant, and thus no inhibition data against
other ca isoforms were available in the literature till recently [15].
although acting as moderate-weak inhibitors of ca ii, and ca i,
all these drugs were shown to considerably inhibit other ca
isozymes known nowadays to be involved in critical physiologic
processes, among the many cas present in vertebrates. some low
nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against such isoforms
were detected, such as metholazone against ca vii, xii and xiii,
 xxxd1680xxx  against ca vb, vii, ix, xii and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx 
against ca vii, ix, xii and xiii, furosemide against ca i, ii and
xiv, and  xxxd381xxx  against ca ix and xii. the x-ray crystal
structure of the ca ii –  xxxd2343xxx  adduct was also resolved at
high resolution, showing features that may be useful for the drug
design of novel classes of cais. we proposed that the recently
observed beneficial effect of  xxxd2343xxx  for the treatment of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes is due to the potent
inhibition of ca isoforms present in kidneys and blood vessels,
which explain both the blood pressure lowering effects as well as
organ-protective activity of the drug. thus, a class of old drugs may
be useful to design ca inhibitors with completely novel applications in therapy.
