 xxxg682xxx  (egfr) is expressed,
albeit at low or intermediate levels, in human melanomas
at the different stages of tumor progression. coexpression
of egfr with its ligand tgfa indicates their role in
paracrine and autocrine growth regulation of melanomas.
as it was previously observed for several types of cancer,
speciﬁc inhibitors of egfr-mediated signaling may
reduce antiapoptotic properties of cancer cells and
sensitize them to cytotoxic drugs. we recently reported
that arsenite, particularly in combination with inhibitors
of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) kinase (mek)-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (erk) pathways, induces high levels of apoptosis
in different melanomas. since egfr signaling operates
via activation of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mek-erk pathways, we suggested that the combination of arsenite and
egfr inhibitors might also effectively induce apoptosis in
melanoma. here, we demonstrate that a moderate
concentration of arsenite (5–10 lm) indeed upregulates
apoptosis induced by egfr inhibitors in egfr-positive
melanomas. in contrast, induction of apoptosis in
melanomas with negligible surface expression of egfr
or with defective egfr signaling requires direct suppression of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mapk pathways by speciﬁc
pharmacological inhibitors in the presence of arsenite.
under these conditions, metastatic melanoma cell lines
undergo  xxxg2303xxx  (trail)and  xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx )-mediated apoptosis. taken together, these data provide additional
approaches in sensitizing melanomas to the cytotoxic
effects of speciﬁc inhibitors of survival pathways.

introduction
 xxxg682xxx  signaling has become
an important target in anticancer drug development due
to its ability to control tumor cell proliferation and to
suppress apoptosis (yarden and sliwkowski, 2001).
extensive efforts to develop  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) inhibitors for anticancer therapy
(levitzki and gazit, 1995; wakeling et al., 1996; dancey
and sausville, 2003; gschwind et al., 2004) ﬁnally led to
approval of one of the small reversible inhibitors,
geﬁtinib (iressa, astrazeneca), for non-small-cell lung
cancer treatment and of an inhibitory anti-egfr
monoclonal antibody, imc- xxxd467xxx  (erbitux, imclone
systems), for metastatic colorectal cancer treatment.
activation of the egfr pathway in cancer cells is based
on several distinct mechanisms, such as ampliﬁcation
and/or overexpression of the egfr gene, increased
production of ligands, egf or tgfa, decreased
receptor turnover, and the presence of altered forms of
receptors due to speciﬁc activating mutations or
profound gene rearrangement. effects of egfr signaling on cell proliferation and survival are mediated by the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), pi3k- xxxg118xxx 
and stat pathways (schlessinger, 2000; sibilia et al.,
2000; yarden and sliwkowski, 2001; gschwind et al.,
2004). despite a ubiquitous low-level expression of
egfr in normal cells, inactivation of the egfr gene in
mice has minimal effects on development and survival
(threadgill et al., 1995), indicating that pharmacological
inhibition of egfr signaling should have relatively
minor effects on normal cells. the results of clinical
trials for non-small-cell lung cancer with the egfr
inhibitor geﬁtinib were relatively modest, showing
objective tumor response rates of 10–18% (blackledge
and averbuch, 2004; dancey, 2004). however, the
identiﬁcation of genetic changes in the egfr kinase
domain that can predict tumor response to geﬁtinib was
described in two recent publications (lynch et al., 2004;
paez et al., 2004), resolving the problem of when
geﬁtinib-based monotherapy will be effective for nonsmall-cell lung cancer treatment. combined chemotherapy to treat different forms of cancer, as a rule, is much
more effective than monotherapy. however, the addition of geﬁtinib to traditional chemotherapy failed to

induce signiﬁcant responses (giaccone et al., 2004),
indicating the importance of ﬁnding proper combinations of  xxxd1256xxx  with modulators of other
signaling pathways in the cell.
melanoma is largely curable at early stages of cancer
development; however, there are no adequate treatments
for locally advanced or metastatic stages of this disease
(perlis and herlyn, 2004). therefore, it is very important
to develop novel agents, especially in different combinations, that are both effective and low in toxicity for
melanoma treatment. in contrast to some other tumors,
melanomas express egfr only at low or intermediate
levels while other types of growth factor receptors, such
as  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx , and their correspondent
growth factors are also involved in the paracrine and
autocrine control of melanoma cell proliferation (halaban, 1996; lazar-molnar et al., 2000). in the present
study, we have addressed the question with regard to
effects of suppression of egfr signaling on melanoma
survival. previously, we reported that arsenite in
combination with inhibitors of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mek)-extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathways induces high
levels of apoptosis in different melanomas (ivanov and
hei, 2004). since egfr signaling operates via activation of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mek-erk pathways
(yarden and sliwkowski, 2001), we suggested that the
combination of arsenite and egfr inhibitors would
also be an effective inducer of apoptosis in melanoma.
here, we demonstrate that a moderate concentration of
arsenite (5–10 mm) induces an additive or synergistic
upregulation of apoptosis stimulated by egfr inhibitors in egfr-positive melanomas. in contrast, apoptosis induction in melanomas with negligible surface
expression of egfr requires direct suppression of the
pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mapk pathways by speciﬁc pharmacological inhibitors in the presence of arsenite. under
these conditions, metastatic melanoma cells may undergo  xxxg2303xxx  (trail)- or
 xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx )-mediated apoptosis. these data provide additional approaches to
increase apoptotic responses of melanomas to cytotoxic
effects of speciﬁc inhibitors of survival pathways.

results
egfr surface expression in human melanomas and
sensitivity of cancer cells to egfr inhibitors
the egfr surface expression has been determined
using monoclonal anti-egfr antibody and ﬂow
cytometry in both human melanocytes and melanoma
cell lines at different stages of tumor progression
(figure 1a). melanocytes possess low, almost negligible
surface levels of egfr (data not shown). radial growth
phase wm35 and metastatic hhmsx, femx, lox
and om431 melanoma cells were also characterized by
negligible surface expression of egfr. on the other
hand, two early melanoma cell lines, sbcl2 (radial
growth phase), wm793 (vertical growth phase), and

wm9 metastastic melanoma demonstrated average
levels of surface expression of egfr; lu1205 metastatic melanoma cells possess a low surface expression of
egfr (figure 1a). these data indicate an absence of a
direct correlation between surface egfr expression
and the stage of melanoma development. furthermore,
high levels of surface egfr expression may not directly
correlate to the efﬁciency of egfr signaling due to the
possibility of inactivating mutations in the egfr gene
(lynch et al., 2004). the wm793 and wm9 melanoma
cells were chosen for treatment with increased doses of
ag1478, a highly speciﬁc inhibitor of egfr signaling
(levitzki and gazit, 1995). ag1478 (20 mm) induced
reasonably high levels of apoptosis 48 h after treatment
of these cells (figure 1b); pd153035, another inhibitor
of egfr signaling, demonstrated the similar effects
(data not shown). two egfr inhibitors (20 mm) have
been applied for treatment of human melanocytes and
additional melanoma cell lines. these concentrations of
inhibitors are equivalent to doses, which have been used
recently in clinical trails of geﬁtinib (iressa, astrazeneca) for non-small-cell lung cancer treatment (levitzki
and gazit, 1995; wakeling et al., 1996; dancey and
sausville, 2003; gschwind et al., 2004). besides wm793
and wm9, only sbcl2 melanoma cells with intermediate
levels of surface expression of egfr developed high
levels of apoptosis following treatment with inhibitors
(figure 1c).
arsenite increases apoptosis induced by egfr inhibitors
we previously observed that a moderate concentration
of arsenite (5–10 mm) may effectively induce apoptosis in
melanomas, particularly in combination with inhibitors
of the mek-erk and pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathways (ivanov
and hei, 2004). we suggested that the combined
treatment of arsenite and  xxxd1256xxx  should also
be an effective inducer of apoptosis in melanoma,
because egfr-mediated signaling operates via mekerk and pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathways (yarden and sliwkowski, 2001). indeed, ag1478 (20 mm) in concert with
arsenite (10 mm) demonstrated additive effects in the
induction of apoptosis of wm793 cells 24 and 48 h after
treatment (figure 2a). it is interesting to note that the
effects of ag1478 on apoptosis were quite similar to the
effects of  xxxd2523xxx , an inhibitor of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx 
pathway (figure 2b). indeed, western blot analysis of
the total protein of wm793 cells indicated a suppression
of egfr phosphorylation and a substantial inhibition
of phospho- xxxg118xxx  levels following treatment with
ag1478 or combination of ag1478 and arsenite.
simultaneously,  xxxd1256xxx  ag1478 did not affect
basal or arsenite-induced phospho-erk levels, revealing that the mek-erk pathway was not activated by
egfr signaling in wm793 melanoma cells. heme
oxygenase-1 ( xxxg1062xxx ) induction was chosen as a hallmark
of oxidative stress stimulated by arsenite; ag1478
effectively blocked  xxxg1062xxx  induction by arsenite, indicating possible involvement of the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway in
this regulation (figure 2c). so, from two main signaling
pathways, mek-erk and pi3k- xxxg118xxx  usually activated

by egfr in different cell systems, only the pi3k- xxxg118xxx 
pathway was under the control of egfr signaling in
early melanoma wm793 cells. it correlates with the
presence of braf activating mutation t1796a
(v599e), which makes the downstream mek-erk
cascade partially independent of gfr stimulation, in
many melanoma lines including wm793 (dong et al.,
2003; satyamoorthy et al., 2003). our data also indicate
that alternative  xxxg791xxx -,  xxxg1145xxx - or c-met-mediated
signaling may be involved in the regulation of the mekerk cascade in melanomas (satyamoorthy et al., 2003).
the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway affects general cell survival
and proliferation via control of protein levels and
activities of several transcription factors and correspondent target genes, as well as via regulation of the mtor
kinase that is the central controller of general protein
synthesis (bjornsti and houghton, 2004; hanada et al.,
2004). furthermore, the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway has some
speciﬁc antiapoptotic functions, such as an inactivation
of caspase-9 and proapoptotic protein bad (kandel and
hay, 1999). we used rapamycin (100 nm) for speciﬁc
inhibition of mtor (figure 2b). rapamycin did not
promote the effects of arsenite-induced apoptosis,
oncogene

indicating that the  xxxg118xxx -mtor pathway was not
critically involved in the regulation of this type of
apoptosis in wm793 cells. on the other hand,  xxxd2271xxx , a general inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases,
induced apoptosis of wm793 melanoma cells and
increased arsenite-induced apoptosis of these cells highlighting the role of protein tyrosine kinases in general
cell survival (figure 2b). one of the prominent
antiapoptotic actions of arsenite, suppression of nuclear
factor kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ) activity and  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
transcription (kapahi et al., 2000; ivanov and hei,
2004), which was observed after treatment wm793 cells
by arsenite alone or in concert with ag1478 (data not
shown), may be responsible for enhancing ag1478induced apoptosis.
caspase-3-mediated cleavage of parp, an important
feature of apoptosis, was evident 18 h after treatment
with ag1478, pd153035, arsenite and combinations of
inhibitors with arsenite (figure 2d). to further investigate the role of caspases in apoptosis induced by egfr
inhibitors, we used n-acetyl-ile-glu-thr-asp-cho
(aldehyde) (ac-ietd-cho) (an inhibitor of  xxxg342xxx 
and -6), n-acetyl-leu-glu-his-asp-cho (aldehyde)

(c) western blot analysis of total and phosphoegfr, phospho-erk and phospho- xxxg118xxx  levels following treatment with ag1478 (20 mm), arsenite (10 mm) or their combination.
induction of  xxxg1062xxx  was used as a demonstration of arsenite-induced oxidative stress. b-actin served as an internal standard. (d) parp
cleavage was determined by western blot analysis 18 h after treatment with ag1478 (20 mm), pd153035 (20 mm), arsenite (10 mm) and
indicated combinations of inhibitors with arsenite. (e) effects of caspase inhibitors, ac-ietd-cho (50 mm), ac-lehd-cho (50 mm)
and zvad-fmk (50 mm), on induction of apoptosis of wm793 cells by ag1478 or pd153035 (20 mm) treatment

(ac-lehd-cho) (an inhibitor of caspase-9) and
zvad-fmk (a general caspase inhibitor). both caspase8 and -9 inhibitors notably suppressed apoptosis
induced by ag1478, but were less effective for suppression of pd153035-induced cell death; zvad-fmk treatment was an effective suppressor for death induction by
ag1478 or pd153035 (figure 2e).

we further elucidated the effects of arsenite on
ag1478-induced apoptosis using two additional
egfr-positive melanomas, sbcl2 and wm9
(figure 3). for both lines, egfr inhibitors ag1478
(20 mm) or pd153035 (20 mm) and pi3k- xxxg118xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd2523xxx  (50 mm) induced apoptosis and dramatically
enhanced apoptotic effects of arsenite (figure 3a and b).

analysis was performed using ﬂow cytometry

it was well correlated with the downregulation of egfr
phosphorylation and a decrease in basal phospho- xxxg118xxx 
activity following ag1478 (20 mm) treatment
(figure 4a). no negative effects of ag1478 on basal
or arsenite-induced phospho-erk levels have been
observed. arsenite-induced  xxxg1062xxx  activity was substantially suppressed in the presence of ag1478 (figure 4a).
as expected, arsenite alone or in the combination with
ag1478 downregulated  xxxg1559xxx  activity and nf-kbdependent transcription (data not shown) providing
conditions favorable to enhancement of apoptosis.
apoptotic abilities of ag1478, pd153035 and arsenite
in wm9 metastatic melanoma that ﬁnally target
caspase-3 were additionally conﬁrmed by the speciﬁc
caspase-3-dependent cleavage of parp 18 h after
treatment (figure 4b). to further verify the role of
 xxxg118xxx  as a target of suppression by egfr inhibitors, we
used previously established wm9-aktmyr cells (ivanov
et al., 2002) with high levels of permanently active
phospho- xxxg118xxx  and control wm9-puro cells (figure 4c).
wm9-aktmyr cells were substantially more resistant to
apoptotic effects of  xxxd2523xxx  and ag1478 than control
cells (figure 4d).

arsenite treatment. as expected in this case, egfr
inhibitors, ag1478 (figure 5a) and pd153035 (not
shown), induced only slight apoptotic effects and did
not upregulate arsenite-induced apoptosis in lu1205
melanoma cells. by contrast,  xxxd2271xxx , a general
protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, was very effective for
increasing arsenite-induced apoptosis in lu1205 cells
(figure 5a), demonstrating a probable role of alternative
growth factor receptor pathways in the regulation of cell
survival in case of deﬁciency of egfr signaling. since
inhibition of both pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mek-erk pathways may partially mimic the downstream effects of
growth factor receptor inhibition, we treated lu1205
cells with  xxxd2523xxx  (50 mm) and  xxxd1169xxx  (50 mm) with
or without arsenite (figure 5a). we previously observed
(ivanov and hei, 2004) that such treatments induced
high levels of apoptosis in lu1205 cells. as expected,
the combination of  xxxd2523xxx  with arsenite was less

effective than the combination of  xxxd2523xxx ,  xxxd1169xxx 
and arsenite (data not shown).
staining lu1205 cells by annexin-v–fitc and
 xxxd3027xxx  (pi) with subsequent ﬂow cytometry
revealed initial apoptotic and secondary necrotic events
6 h after arsenite treatment in the presence of inhibitors
(data not shown). western blot analysis indicated
suppression of phospho- xxxg118xxx  and phospho- xxxg1366xxx 
activities following treatment with the combination of
speciﬁc inhibitors, while electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (emsa) demonstrated a downregulation of nfkb dna-binding activity (for both bands p65-p50 and
p50-p50) (figure 5b) and  xxxg1559xxx -dependent transcription (data not shown) in the presence of arsenite. since
lu1205 cells produce trail and  xxxg2296xxx  and have
surface expression of  xxxg2296xxx  receptor
(tnfr)1,  xxxg1057xxx   xxxg2298xxx  and  xxxg1057xxx  death receptors (grifﬁth et al.,
1998; ivanov and ronai, 1999), a decrease in the basal
 xxxg1559xxx  activity by arsenite, a decrease in  xxxg118xxx  activity
by  xxxd2523xxx  and a decrease in erk activity by
 xxxd1169xxx  may sensitize these cells to trail- or
 xxxg2296xxx -mediated cell suicide (chen et al., 2001; franco
et al., 2001; zhang et al., 2003b). indeed, pretreatment
with anti-trail or, to a lesser extent, with anti- xxxg2296xxx 
antibodies partially suppressed apoptosis that was
induced by arsenite in combination with  xxxd2523xxx 
and  xxxd1169xxx  (figure 5c). hence, for melanoma cells
with low or negligible levels of surface egfr, it was
possible to induce efﬁcient levels of apoptosis by direct
inhibition of downstream pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mek-erk
signaling pathways in the presence of arsenite.

what are some of the target genes, whose expressions
are dependent on both the egfr- and arsenitemediated signaling? determination of arsenite-affected
gene expression in several cell systems using microarrays
revealed a dramatic upregulation of  xxxg1062xxx  following
arsenite treatment (liu et al., 2001a; yih et al., 2002;
rea et al., 2003; zheng et al., 2003). induction of  xxxg1062xxx 
is the hallmark feature of oxidative stress (durante,
2003). arsenite efﬁciently induced  xxxg1062xxx  in melanomas
6 h after treatment with maximal levels at a dose 10–
20 mm (figure 6a). the role of ap-1/ xxxg206xxx  ( xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx ) transcription factors in the
regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression has been well
established (alam and den, 1992; lee et al., 2000;
gong et al., 2002). ap-1 exists in multiple homo or
hetero combinations of jun–jun, jun–fos and jun–
 xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx  proteins, which may be targets of different
signaling pathways (shaulian and karin, 2002). a
probable function of hif-1 in the transcriptional
activation of  xxxg1062xxx  was also described (lee et al.,
1997).  xxxd3177xxx  (an mapk p38- xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx  inhibitor) and
most effectively  xxxd2523xxx  (a pi3k- xxxg118xxx  inhibitor)
downregulate the  xxxg1062xxx  induction in both wm793 and
lu1205 melanoma cells.  xxxd1169xxx  (an mek-erkelk1-cfos inhibitor) was partially effective only in
lu1205 cells.  xxxd3231xxx  ( xxxg1370xxx  (jnk)’s
inhibitor) did not notably affect  xxxg1062xxx  protein levels in
oncogene

mild increase in apoptosis for lu1205 cells (data not
shown). positive regulation of expression of antiapoptotic protein  xxxg1062xxx  by pi3k- xxxg118xxx  and mek-erk
pathways or by egfr signaling allows connecting the
upregulation of arsenite-induced apoptosis after
 xxxd2523xxx ,  xxxd1169xxx  or ag1478 cotreatment (see
figures 2 and 3), to a certain extent, with suppression
of the  xxxg1062xxx  expression.
it is interesting to note that downregulation of
arsenite-induced  xxxg1062xxx  protein levels in cancer cells by
egfr inhibitors may serve as an easily performed
additional test in the determination of the physiologically active state of egfr signaling in these cells (as an
alternative to the determination of egfr phosphorylation). the absence of the surface egfr expression or
mutations of egfr that disturb egfr-mediated
signaling may suppress the effects of egfr inhibitors
on  xxxg1062xxx  activity, as we observed for femx melanoma
cells (figure 6b and c).

these data supported the role of ap-1/ xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx -dependent
regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  expression (via mapk p38 and erk)
in melanomas. targets of pi3k- xxxg118xxx  signaling for the
 xxxg1062xxx  expression are not completely identiﬁed. probable
targets are transcription factors nrf2 and hif-1, which
controls the  xxxg1062xxx  gene transcription. the stability of
nrf2 and hif-1 proteins is dependent on pi3k- xxxg118xxx 
signaling (jiang et al., 2001; alam and cook, 2003;
martin et al., 2004). if inhibitors of egfr signaling
downregulate the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway, they also should
suppress  xxxg1062xxx  induction by arsenite. indeed, we observed
an effective suppression of arsenite-induced  xxxg1062xxx  expression in the egfr-positive wm793 melanoma cells by
ag1478 and the absence of suppression for the egfrnegative femx cells (figure 6b and c).
 xxxg1062xxx  is known to possess numerous antioxidative
stress functions, including interference and suppression
of tnf- and fasl-mediated apoptosis (brouard et al.,
2002; zhang et al., 2003a). direct suppression of  xxxg1062xxx 
by introduction of its pharmacological inhibitor, zncontaining  xxxd3037xxx  (pp ix (zn2 þ )) (50 mm),
notably accelerated arsenite-induced apoptosis of
wm793 melanoma cells and had a certain, but relatively
oncogene

apoptosis is one of the key regulatory mechanisms in
the development of multicellular organism and in the
regulation of its general homeostasis, and also in the
initiation and progression of degenerative diseases.
apoptosis serves as a defensive mechanism to remove
potentially dangerous cells such as primary tumor cells
and virus-infected cells. however, most if not all
metastatic cancer cells have serious defects in the control
of apoptosis providing cancer cells the ability to resist
death (evan and vousden, 2001; johnstone et al., 2002;
kitada et al., 2002). two fundamental signaling pathways, ras-raf-mek-erk-( xxxg696xxx ,  xxxg1222xxx 
(ap-1)) and pi3k- xxxg118xxx -(fkhd, mtor), which are
initiated by the interactions of growth factor receptors
with cognate growth factors, are involved in the
regulation of cell proliferation and general cell survival
(figure 7). components of these two pathways are
frequent targets for gene mutations, which may change
their inducible status to a permanently active state. for
example, ras and braf genes together have activating
mutations in almost 80% of all melanomas (davies
et al., 2002; tuveson et al., 2003; reifenberger et al.,
2004). the egfr gene by itself is also very often
mutated in different tumors (lynch et al., 2004). the
 xxxg1559xxx  signaling pathway tnfr-traf2-ikkikb* xxxg1559xxx -( xxxg1559xxx ) (figure 7), which balances cell
survival and proapoptotic functions, is also often
overactivated in different tumors as a result of
epigenetic or genetic alterations (karin et al., 2002,
2004; orlowski and baldwin, 2002; lin and karin, 2003;
chen and greene, 2004).
we recently investigated apoptotic activity of arsenite
in human melanomas (ivanov and hei, 2004), which is
based on two main aspects of arsenite function in the
cell: (1) arsenite acts as a sulfhydryl reagent, which binds
to free thiol (–sh) group of enzymes and inhibits their
functions (snow, 1992) and (2) arsenite induces strong
production of reactive oxygen species (ros) with

egfr inhibitors and arsenite upregulated apoptosis

figure 7 kinase targets and inhibitors. a schematic illustration of the principal signaling pathways that are affected by the inhibitors,
which are described in this paper. protein  xxxg2198xxx  activity of egfr is inhibited with ag1478 or pd153035. downstream
events of egfr-mediated signaling include a formation of multisubunit scaffold complex with the activation of the ras-raf-mekerk pathway.  xxxd1169xxx  and  xxxd3462xxx  are speciﬁc inhibitors of  xxxg1361xxx /2. the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway that is initiated at the active egfr
can be suppressed with pharmacological inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  or with the endogenous inhibitor pten. the mek-erk and pi3kakt pathways activate the speciﬁc sets of transcription factors, which are involved in the antiapoptotic and cell-cycle gene expression.
 xxxg118xxx  also regulates general protein translation via mtor kinase, which is sensitive to rapamycin. the tnfr-mediated signaling
induces via adaptor proteins ikk activity followed by phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of ikb, and release
and nuclear translocation of  xxxg1559xxx , which regulates the expression of many different genes, including antiapoptotic genes.
simultaneously, the tnfr-mediated signaling may activate  xxxg342xxx /caspase-3 proapoptotic pathway; at normal conditions,
however, this pathway is suppressed by the  xxxg1559xxx -dependent antiapoptotic proteins. arsenite upregulates the mapk pathways, but
eventually suppresses ikk- xxxg1559xxx  activation affecting a balance between cell survival and apoptosis

subsequent development of oxidative stress, which
affects multiple targets in the cell (hei et al., 1998; liu
et al., 2001b; li et al., 2002). there are two important
targets of enzymatic inhibition by arsenite: (1) inhibitor
nuclear factor kappa b-kinase b ( xxxg1159xxx ) (kapahi et al.,
2000; roussel and barchowsky, 2000; hershko et al.,
2002), which results in the suppression of  xxxg1559xxx 
transcription factor activation followed by the dramatic
change of the anti- and proapoptotic functions of the
cells (karin and lin, 2002; amit and ben-neriah, 2003;
mathas et al., 2003) and (2) jak2  xxxg2198xxx ,
which results in the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and functional activation of stat3, which controls
numerous survival functions of cells (darnell, 2002;
levy and darnell, 2002; hayashi et al., 2003; cheng
et al., 2004). as a result of oxidative stress, stressinduced kinase pathways (mkk6-mapk p38, mkk4/
7-jnk and mek- xxxg1369xxx /2) simultaneously activate and
upregulate the ap-1 (jun–fos, jun– xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx ) transcription factors and induce ap-1-dependent gene expression
(cavigelli et al., 1996; chen et al., 1998; ludwig et al.,
1998; bode and dong, 2002). on the one hand,
arsenite suppresses general cell survival via inhibition
of  xxxg1559xxx  and stat3, and on the other, it stimulates
map kinases and some antiapoptotic functions. to

enhance proapoptotic events, it would be necessary to
suppress the mapk and pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathways in
concert with arsenite treatment (figure 7). we present
here data that show the additive or synergistic effects of
egfr inhibitors and arsenite on apoptosis in egfrpositive melanomas. in these melanomas, egfr
inhibitors suppressed the pi3k- xxxg118xxx  pathway, while
the mek-erk pathway was independent of their
actions. this obviously indicates that other gfrs (such
as  xxxg791xxx ,  xxxg1145xxx  and c-met) are involved in the
regulation of mek-erk signaling in melanomas
(satyamoorthy et al., 2003; von willebrand et al.,
2003). furthermore, braf t1796a (v599e) activating
mutation, which has been found in wm793, wm9,
lu1205, om431 and lox melanomas (but not in
sbcl2, wm35 or femx) upregulates basal levels of
erk activity (dong et al., 2003; krasilnikov et al.,
2003; satyamoorthy et al., 2003). the combination of
 xxxd2523xxx  (an inhibitor of pi3k- xxxg118xxx ),  xxxd3462xxx  (an
inhibitor of  xxxg1361xxx /2-erk) and arsenite (an inhibitor of
 xxxg1159xxx  and jak2), which affects the downstream targets
of gfr and  xxxg1559xxx  signaling, was extremely effective
for the induction of apoptosis in all tested melanomas,
as well as in the prostate adenocarcinomas (vn ivanov
and tk hei, unpublished observations).

there is an obvious mechanistic analogy in the
general arrangement of pro- and antiapoptotic signaling
between melanomas and prostate adenocarcinomas. in
this respect, androgen-dependent lncap cells with low
basal  xxxg1559xxx  activity and high sensitivity to  xxxg2296xxx - or
arsenite-induced apoptosis are similar to early wm793
melanoma cells. on the other hand, highly aggressive
androgen-independent du145 prostate cancer cells
with a high basal  xxxg1559xxx  activity and resistance to both
 xxxg2296xxx - or arsenite-induced apoptosis are quite similar to
metastatic melanoma lu1205. for both cell systems,
downregulation of the basal  xxxg1559xxx  activities by different
agents may induce  xxxg2296xxx - and trail-mediated apoptosis (huerta-yepez et al., 2004). surprisingly, in spite of
the high surface expression of egfr in  xxxg1682xxx  and du145
prostate cancer cells, inhibitors of egfr (alone or in
concert with arsenite) induced only modest levels of
apoptosis (vn ivanov and tk hei, unpublished observations). this was opposite to egfr-positive melanomas,
which are highly responsive to the combined treatment of
egfr inhibitors and arsenite, as was shown in this study.
this discrepancy may reﬂect potential mutations and
alterations of the egfr gene in prostate cancer cell lines,
as has been recently reported in non-small-cell lung cancer
cells (lynch et al., 2004; paez et al., 2004).

(alexis, san diego, ca, usa) were added (1–5 mg/ml) 1 h
before arsenite treatment. apoptosis was assessed by quantifying the percentage of hypodiploid nuclei undergoing dna
fragmentation (nicoletti et al., 1991) or by quantifying the
percentage of annexin-v–fitc-positive cells (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa). flow cytometric analysis was
performed on a facs calibur ﬂow cytometer (becton
dickinson) using the cellquest program. surface expression
of egfr on cancer cells was determined by staining them with
phycoerythrin (pe)-anti-egfr monoclonal antibody (bd
pharmingen) and by ﬂow cytometry.
western blot analysis
cell lysates (50–100 mg protein) were resolved on 10% sds–
page, and processed according to the standard protocols.
the antibodies used were polyclonal anti-phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42
map kinase (thr202/tyr204), anti- xxxd1355xxx /42 map kinase,
anti-phospho- xxxg118xxx  (ser473), anti- xxxg118xxx , anti-phospho-p38
map kinase (thr180/tyr182), anti- xxxg1368xxx , antiparp (cell signaling, beverly, ma, usa), polyclonal
anti- xxxg1062xxx  (stressgen, victoria, canada) and monoclonal
anti-b-actin (sigma) (optimal dilutions of abs were 1 : 1000
to 1 : 10 000). the secondary abs (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse)
were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1 : 5000
to 1 : 10000). signals were detected using the ecl system
(amersham, piscataway, nj, usa).

human melanoma cell lines, wm35, sbcl2, lu1205 (also
known as 1205lu), wm9, wm793 (satyamoorthy et al., 1997;
berking et al., 2001; li et al., 2001, 2003) and om431 were
maintained in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, l-glutamine and antibiotics. femx, hhmsx
and lox, human melanoma lines (myklebust et al., 1994),
were maintained in rpmi1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. normal human
melanocytes were maintained in ticva medium.
treatment, apoptosis studies and fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (facs) analysis
cells were exposed to arsenite (1–10 mm) in the medium for 6–
48 h. speciﬁc inhibitors of egfr ag1478 (20 mm) and
pd153035 (20 mm), pi3k- xxxg118xxx   xxxd2523xxx  (50 mm), of mekerk  xxxd1169xxx  (50 mm) or  xxxd3462xxx  (10 mm), of jnk’s  xxxd3231xxx 
(10–20 mm) and of mapk p38  xxxd3177xxx  (5–10 mm) were used
with or without 5–10 mm arsenite. inhibitors were added to
media 30 min before arsenite treatment. antibodies against
 xxxg2296xxx  (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa) and trail
oncogene

emsa was performed for detection of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding

was used for the determination  xxxg1559xxx  transactivation.
transient transfection of  xxxg1559xxx  reporter construct (0.5 mg)
and pcmv-b-gal (0.25 mg) into 5  105 melanoma cells was
performed using lipofectamine (life technologies-invitrogen). proteins were prepared for b-gal and luciferase analysis
16 h after transfection. luciferase activity was determined
using the luciferase assay system (promega, madison, wi,
usa) and was normalized based on b-galactosidase levels.
