ga-101, a third-generation, humanized and glyco-engineered anti-cd20 mab for the treatment of b-cell lymphoid malignancies.  glycart biotechnology ag, genentech inc, f hoffmann-la roche ltd, biogen idec inc and chugai pharmaceutical co ltd are developing ga-101, a third-generation, humanized and glyco-engineered anti-cd20 igg1 mab, for the potential treatment of b-cell malignancies. compared with classic type i cd20 antibodies (eg, rituximab), ga-101 binds with high affinity to the cd20 type ii epitope, resulting in the induction of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity that is 5- to 100-fold greater than observed upon treatment with rituximab. ga-101 also exhibits superior direct cell killing properties than rituximab. in preclinical studies, ga-101 was significantly more potent and effective in depleting b-cells than rituximab, and induced dose-dependent antitumor activity, complete tumor regression and improved long-term survival in xenograft mouse models of b-cell malignancy. in a phase i/ii clinical trial, ga-101 had a similar safety profile to rituximab, and exhibited promising efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory cd20-positive lymphoid malignancies. at the time of publication, phase i/ii trials for ga-101 were ongoing in b-cell malignancies. based on preclinical and preliminary clinical data, ga-101 appears to be a promising therapeutic agent for cd20-positive b-cell lymphoid malignances, including non-hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
