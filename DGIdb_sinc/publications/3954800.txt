abstract-the antidepressant  xxxd2647xxx  (3-(2-morpholino-ethylamino) 4-methyl 6-phenyl pyridazine,
dihydrochloride) andits main metabolites were examined for their  xxxg1357xxx  (mao) inhibitory
effects in the rat. in our experimental conditions,  xxxd2647xxx  displayed in vitro a very weak affinity for
brain mao a and b with icons close to 1 mm. however, ex uivo, after intraperitoneal administration,
this drug behaved as a specific and short-acting type a mao inhibitor (maoi) of mild potency (ed~” =
12.8mg/kg). in comparison, the reversible type a maois, moclobemide and cimoxatone, were
respectively 14 and 5 times more potent. when administered orally,  xxxd2647xxx  proved to be considerably
less active. the results presented in this study suggest that  xxxd2647xxx  inhibits mao a mainly after
being converted into active metabolites. however, the chloroform extractable metabolites were found
inactive in vitro towards this enzyme, suggesting that mao inhibitory activity is mediated by one or

more other non-identified metabolites.

a number of studies have demonstrated that in most
mammalian tissues,  xxxg1357xxx  (mao, ec
1.4.3.4, monoamine oxygen oxidoreductase (flavin
containing)) exists in two distinct forms, i.e. mao
a and mao b. in the rat brain, type a mao
preferentially deaminates 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5
ht, serotonin) and noradrenaline (na), and is selectively inhibited by  xxxd1730xxx  and harmaline, whereas
type b mao prefers pphenethylamine
(pea) as
substrate and is highly sensitive to the specific inhibitor l-deprenyl. finally, dopamine (da) seems to be
deaminated by both forms of mao [l].
during the last few years, selective and shortacting type a mao inhibitors (maois) have been
developed as potential antidepressants
since the
endogenous monoamines 5-ht and na are thought
to play a major role in depression [2]. these compounds include cimoxatone [3], moclobemide [4],
amiflamine [5] and cgp-11305 a [6].
 xxxd2647xxx 
[3-(2-morpholino-ethylamino)
4methyl 6-phenyl pyridazine, dihydrochloride]
[7]
(fig. 1) is chemically unrelated to other known psychotropic drugs, and has recently been shown to
be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of
various depressive disorders [8,9]. this compound
exhibits an original spectrum of antidepressant activities when compared in various rodent models to
tricyclic and atypical antidepressants [lo]. moreover,
 xxxd2647xxx  stimulates central dopaminergic transmission [lo-131. preliminary biochemical studies
have suggested that  xxxd2647xxx  administered intraperitoneally could act, at least in part, by inhibiting
mao activity in rat brain [14]. these results
prompted us to examine, both in vitro and ex viuo,
the effects of  xxxd2647xxx  on mao a and b activities

in the rat. for comparison this study includes two
short-acting type a maois, moclobemide (ro ll1163) and cimoxatone (md 780515).
materialsand methods
male sprague-dawley albino rats (charles river
breeding laboratories, france, 210 2 20 g, s.e.m.)

always refer to the salt if any. the rats were decapitated, their striata and liver rapidly dissected out,
weighed, frozen on dry ice and stored at -80” until
estimation of mao activity. after thawing, pooled
or individual striata (65.2 ? 1.4mg, s.e.m.) and
livers (9.9 * 0.1 g, s.e.m.) were homogenized in
16~01. (w/v) of ice-cold 0.1 m na2hp04/kh2p04
buffer, ph 7.40, using a polytron homogenizer (pt
10 model, kinematica,
switzerland;
setting 6,
20 set) .
mao activity was determined according to kan
and strolin benedetti [15]. fifty ~1 of homogenate
were preincubated with the inhibitor (50 4) in 200 ~1
of 0.1 m na/k phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, for 5 min
at 37”. when irreversible maois were used, the
preincubation
time was 30 min. the reaction was
started by addition of 50 ~1 of (14c) 5-ht (mao a
activity) or (‘“c) pea (mao b activity). the final
substrate concentrations and incubation times were
as follows: 5-ht, striatum and liver, 48opm and
520 ,&4 respectively,
10 min;
pea,
striatum,
12.5 ,um, 5 min. serotonin and pea concentrations
were chosen as 3 times their respective k,,, values
(kan, unpublished results). in all cases, enzyme
activity was linear with both time and tissue concentration. finally, in conditions used for determination of mao a activity in the striatum with 5ht as substrate, the percentage of the total mao
activity due to the b form did not exceed 3-4% [16].
the reaction was stopped by addition of 250 ~1 of
2n hcl and the acid metabolite was extracted in
4ml of a mixture of toluene-ethylacetate
(v/v) by
vigorous mixing (turbula, bachofen, switzerland)
for 10min. after centrifugation
(looog, 5min),
1.5 ml (5ht) or 1 ml (pea) of the organic layer
were added to 5 ml of the scintillator cocktail unisolve@ (koch-light).
the
radioactivity
was
measured in a beckman ls-1801 scintillation spectrometer using plastic mini-vials. samples run with
2n hcl were used as blanks. triplicate determinations at each concentration of the mao1 were
used, and 8-12 different
concentrations
were
analysed.
the concentrations
inhibiting
mao
activity by 50% (x5,,)
were determined from log
concentration-inhibition
curves. the determination
of the kinetic parameters of mao a (k,,, and v,,,,,)
and the analysis of its inhibition by  xxxd2647xxx , were
determined from regression analysis of graphical
data (double-reciprocal
and dixon plots). the inhibition of both forms of mao ex viuo after administration of the test compounds to rats was measured
in vitro as described above. the doses producing
50% inhibition (edge) were determined from log
dose-inhibition
plots.
mao activity was expressed as percent of
control ? s.e.m. statistical significance was calculated using the appropriate tests (see legends of
the figures).

results

in homogenates
of rat striatum,
 xxxd2647xxx 
behaved as a very weak inhibitor of mao activity
with similar lcso
values for mao a and b (9 10m4and
3 10m3m respectively) (table 1). like  xxxd2647xxx ,
moclobemide slightly inhibited mao a (iq =
6 10m4m) and mao b (icy,,
= 1 10e3 m). in comparison, cimoxatone was much more potent and
specific towards type a mao (~csa = 2 lo-*m)
(table 1). as expected,  xxxd1730xxx  and harmaline
showed strong affinity and selectivity for mao a,
and r_-deprenyl exhibited potent type b mao
inhibiting properties (table 1). the double-reciprocal plot (lineweaver-burk)
of mao a inhibition
by  xxxd2647xxx  was linear (r 2 0.92). all straight lines
crossed on the l/v axis at the same point suggesting
that the inhibition was fully competitive in nature
(fig. 2a). in these conditions, the dixon plot yields
a ki of 174@m (fig. 2b). finally, the minaprineinduced inhibition of mao a in vitro was not
modified when the preincubation time was enhanced
until 30 min (data not shown).

;d order to assess if  xxxd2647xxx  inhibits mao a
activity per se or after conversion into active metabolites, rats were treated with skf-525 a (75 mg/kg,
lp.) a potent blocker of the hepatic cytochrome p450 hydroxylating system [18]. ninety minutes later,
an acute dose of  xxxd2647xxx  (15 mg/kg) was administered i.p. animals were sacrificed 15min after
 xxxd2647xxx 
treatment.
in these conditions,
the
expected reduction of mao a activity induced by
 xxxd2647xxx  alone (50 f 3%) was significantly reduced
to 33 zl2% (p < 0.001) in rats pretreated with skf525 a. in these conditions, skf-525 a alone did not
inhibit mao a.

deamination of 5-ht and pea by rat striatum was
studied in vitro. as shown in table 3, none of the
compounds tested displayed a significant affinity for
either mao a or mao b.
discussion

the results obtained in this study indicate that in
our experimental conditions,  xxxd2647xxx , at least ex
viuo after i.p. ad~nistration,
behaves as a specific
and short-acting type a maoi. this conclusion is
mainly supported by the weak inhibitory effect of
 xxxd2647xxx  on pea deamination in striatum, compared to the high inhibition of s-ht deamination
observed in this structure as well as in the liver (table
2, fig. 3). furthermore, no inhibition was observed
24 hr after treatment suggesting that the effect was

et ai.

reversible in nature (figs. 3 and 4). thus, the values
measured for mao activity do not represent an
absolute determination,
but are dependent on the
conditions of tissue dilution used in the assay. however, the activity of  xxxd2647xxx  after oral administration appeared at doses considerably higher than
after i.p. administration
(table 2). finally,  xxxd2647xxx  protected against the irreversible inhibition of
mao a induced by  xxxd1730xxx  thus confirming the
reversible and specific effect of the drug towards
mao a (fig. 4). similar evidences have been presented with several short-acting type a maois [19]
including moclobemide 1203 and cimoxatone 1151.
according to the ex vivo edge values of mao a
inhibition listed in table 2,  xxxd2647xxx  appeared, as
a moderate type a mao1 after i.p. administration,
in this respect,  xxxd2647xxx  was much less potent than
moclobemide
and cimoxatone.
en vivo, moclobemide is a very potent, short-acting and selective
inhibitor of mao a (table 2) [4]. however, in vitro,
this compound displayed a very slight affinity for this
enzyme (table 1) [21], although much higher iq,
values (1-3 @f) have been published [4,20]. such
discrepancies could be explained, at least in part, by
different expe~mental
conditions (tissue dilution,
substrate concentrations) used in mao assays. biochemical studies have clearly demonstrated
that
cimoxatone is a potent, specific and reversible type
a mao1 [3,15]. in vitro, this compound showed a
strong affinity for the active site of mao a (table
1) [21,22]. fix viuo, cimoxatone was, however, less
potent than expected (table 2) due to its biotransformation to a less active metabolite [22].
the discrepancy between in vitro and ex uivo (i.p,
or p.o.) results with  xxxd2647xxx  (tables 2 and 3)
suggests that one (or several) metabolitets) may be
responsible for mao a inhibition. this conclusion
could be supported by the following observations.
brain concentrations of unchanged  xxxd2647xxx  (1214@f) detected in rat after an acute i.p. dose of
15mg/kg 1231 were 10 times below its ki value
towards brain mao a (174pm, fig. 1). furthermore, when the hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450 hydroxylating system was blocked by sw-52.5
a [18], a slight but significant decrease of the mina-

effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on  xxxg1357xxx  in rat

prine-induced
inhibition
of brain mao a was
observed. however, the effect of skf-525 a was
rather weak (17%) suggesting that part of the conversion of  xxxd2647xxx  could not involve this system.
 xxxd2647xxx  undergoes extensive biotransfo~ation
in different species including rat, with major groups
of metabolites derived from phenyl-hydroxylation
or
degradation of the morpholin ring [17]. the difference in potency towards mao a between the i.p.
and the p.o. route cannot be ascribed to a poor
biodisponibility
since in rats 90% of  xxxd2647xxx  is
absorbed after oral administration.
this difference
could be due to metabolic differences between the
two routes although no qualitative or quantitative
differences were observed in the chloroform extractable metabolites after i.p. or oral administration.*
these metabolites were tested, but brain type a
mao was not inhibited by any of the compounds
tested (table 3). in particular, metabolites m3 and
m5 (fig. l), which were detected in rat and monkey
brain after  xxxd2647xxx  administration * [23,24], were
inactive (table 3). thus the precise mechanism by
which  xxxd2647xxx  inhibits type a mao ex uivo, is
at present unclear. however, the existence of an
undetected metabolite with sufficient affinity for this
enzyme cannot be excluded.
as far as mono~ine
levels and metabolism are
concerned,  xxxd2647xxx  was reported to induce modifications which are compatible with mao inhibition.
thus,  xxxd2647xxx  (3-30 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced 5-ht
levels in various rat brain regions. this increase was
associated with a significant reduction of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5hiaa)
levels [25,26]. in these
conditions,  xxxd2647xxx  failed to modify striatal da
levels, but decreased its acid metabolites
3-4
dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (dopac) and homovanilic acid (hva), and enhanced the levels of 3methoxytyramine (3-mt), the extraneuronal metabolite of da 1141. in terms of dose-ranging and time
dependency, these effects are consistent with the
 xxxd2647xxx -induced
mao a inhibition,
reported
above. comparable patterns have been published
for moclobemide [4,20] and cimoxatone [3].
similarly, part of the pharmacological profile of
 xxxd2647xxx  in rodent models of antidepressant activity
fits with its mao inhibiting properties. thus, like
most type a maois [27],  xxxd2647xxx  antagonized
the effects of reserpine, potentiated
5-hydroxytryptophan
(5”htp)-induced
tremor and headtwitches, and reduced immobility in the despair test,
in mice, with a dose-range of 3 to 30 mg/kg i.p. and
p.o. [lo]. this suggests that the mao inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2647xxx  does not fully account for its
pharmacological activities.
this study clearly indicates that ex vivo, at least
after i.p. administration,
in rodents the antidepressant drug  xxxd2647xxx  behaves, as a moderate
specific and short-acting type a maoi. this property appears to be mediated by (a) yet non-identified
metabolite(s).
