conformational changes in prorenin during renin inhibition
in vitro and in vivo

background some renin inhibitors induce changes in
the conformation of prorenin in vitro and influence
the quantification of active renin by immunoradiometric
assays. whether such changes in renin recognition by
monoclonal antibodies exist after oral administration of
 xxxd113xxx , the first orally available renin inhibitor, is not
known.
methods two commercially available immunoradiometric
assays (cisbio and nichols) were compared to determine
immunoreactive active renin concentrations in plasma
samples collected in a single oral dose crossover study
comparing the renin inhibitor,  xxxd113xxx  (300 mg), with the
 xxxg99xxx  antagonist,  xxxd3487xxx  (160 mg), in healthy
male subjects.

difference between the results obtained with the two assays
depended on incubation time.
conclusions depending on incubation conditions,
circulating renin inhibitors interfere with the recognition of
active renin molecules by the monoclonal antibodies used in
commercially available assays. careful consideration must
therefore be given to the methodology used for quantifying
immunoreactive plasma active renin when patients are
treated with renin inhibitors, to avoid an overestimation of
the magnitude of active renin release attributable to
conformational changes in plasma prorenin. j hypertens

results the addition of  xxxd113xxx  to plasma samples in vitro,
at concentrations of 1–100 mmol/l, increased active renin
immunoreactivity in both the cisbio and nichols assays. in
the crossover study, the two assays gave similar values for
the plasma immunoreactive active renin concentration
before treatment and following  xxxd3487xxx  administration
(intraclass coefficient for agreement between the two
assays u 0.92). however, a bland–altman plot showed a
systematic bias towards higher values (1.75-fold higher;

introduction

active renin [11]. thus, monoclonal antibodies selective
for active renin do not bind (4g1) or bind only minimally
(r1-20-5) to prorenin in immunoradiometric sandwich
assays, but recognize human acid-treated prorenin and
prorenin bound to a renin inhibitor.

incubation of the renin inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx  (10 mmol/l)
with plasma for 1 h at 378c prevents the inactivation of
cryo- and acid-activated prorenin [1,2]. this result was
obtained with the anti-renin monoclonal antibodies 4g1
and 3e8, used in the development of the cisbio commercial kit (cisbio international, bagnols-sur-ceze,
france) [3,4] and extended to another pair of monoclonal
antibodies, r1-20-5 and r3-36-16, subsequently used in
the development of the nichols commercial kit (nichols
institute, san capistrano, california, usa) [5–7]. on the
basis of these results, derkx et al. [2] suggested that
active-site directed renin inhibitors induced a change
in the conformation of the prorenin molecule, enhancing
recognition of its 43-amino acid residue prosegment.
this interpretation was confirmed using monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies directed against various sequences of the prorenin peptide sequence [8–10]. another
renin inhibitor, sr 43845, used at a concentration of
100 mmol/l, also increases the detection of prorenin by
the 4g1 monoclonal antibody directed against human

the observation of derkx et al. [2] led us to investigate
whether the administration of a new orally active renin
inhibitor,  xxxd113xxx , might lead to an overestimation of
plasma immunoreactive active renin concentration or
influence prorenin conformation in vivo. this hypothesis
was suggested by the results of a study in which we
compared the effects on plasma immunoreactive active
renin concentration and blood pressure of single oral
doses of 300 mg  xxxd113xxx , 160 mg  xxxd3487xxx , 80 mg
 xxxd3487xxx  combined with 150 mg  xxxd113xxx , and placebo
in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive male volunteers [12]. we observed a marked dissociation between
the renin response and the blood pressure response to the
renin inhibitor and the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist:

concentration was significantly much longer after the
administration of 300 mg  xxxd113xxx  than after the administration of 160 mg  xxxd3487xxx , whereas the decrease in
24-h blood pressure was similar [12].
to test the possibility of an overestimation of plasma
immunoreactive active renin concentrations with  xxxd113xxx  in vivo, we first performed measurements of plasma
immunoreactive renin concentrations in vitro with two
commercially available kits, in the presence of increasing
concentrations of  xxxd113xxx  by comparison with  xxxd3095xxx ,
the first renin inhibitor known to induce conformational
change of the prorenin molecule [2]. in addition, in two
different sandwich assays, we compared the results of
plasma immunoreactive active renin measurements
obtained during the experiment performed in vivo in
sodium depleted normotensive subjects [12].

materials and methods
ex-vivo/in-vitro experiment

we quantified immunoreactive active renin in parallel
with the cisbio kit, which was developed from the diagnostics pasteur kit (sanofi diagnostics pasteur, marnes la
coquette, france) [4], and the nichols kit [2], under the
conditions recommended by the manufacturers.
plasma samples from two normal control subjects were
incubated with various concentrations of  xxxd113xxx  and
a control renin inhibitor,  xxxd3095xxx , from 10 nmol/l to
100 mmol/l. the inhibitors were added in plasma just
before starting the incubation. in the cisbio assay, the
sample was shaken and incubated for 3 h at room temperature whereas, in the nichols assay, the sample was
incubated for 24 h at room temperature without shaking.
the cisbio assay was also carried out on a third plasma
sample, using an incubation time of 24 h without shaking.
in-vivo study in normotensive subjects with mild
sodium depletion

plasma immunoreactive active renin was determined in
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, fourperiod crossover study in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive male subjects. as previously reported [12]. after
providing their written informed consent for participation, 12 healthy caucasian normotensive male volunteers
(aged 18–35 years) received a single oral dose of 300 mg
 xxxd113xxx  (a300), 160 mg  xxxd3487xxx  (v160), a combination
of these two drugs (each at half dose; a150 þ v80) or
matched placebos (p), 12 h after the induction of mild
sodium depletion by a single oral dose of 40 mg furosemide. the subjects were also fed a sodium-restricted diet
(30 mmol/day), as in the protocol used to demonstrate the
additive effects of captopril and losartan on blood pressure and renin release [13]. treatments were allocated
according to a latin square design. the protocol was
approved by the ‘comité consultatif de protection des
personnes se prêtant à des recherches biomédicales’

(paris-cochin, france). the study adhered to the principles of the declaration of helsinki and title 45, us
code of federal regulations, part 46, protection of
human subjects, revised november 13, 2001, effective
december 13, 2001. all procedures followed were in
accordance with institutional guidelines.
plasma immunoreactive active renin was determined
with the cisbio commercial kit [4], as in all our previous
studies. care was taken to avoid cryoactivation [14–16],
and two separate aliquots were frozen for each plasma
sample. plasma active renin was also determined with the
nichols kit [2]. renin determination was standardized
with the two kits by using the same medical research
council (mrc) standard (lot 68/356) for both, rather
than the standard provided by the manufacturers.
total renin (prorenin þ active renin) concentration was
also determined with the cisbio kit after activating all
renin molecules by incubation at 48c for 1 h, followed
by trypsin treatment (5 ml of 100 mg/ml trypsin in
0.0025 n hcl) and incubation at 48c for 1 h [16].
statistical analysis

plasma immunoreactive active renin concentrations were
log-transformed for statistical analysis. a repeatedmeasures analysis of variance was used to assess the
effects of  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  on plasma active renin
concentration, plasma total renin concentration and
plasma active renin/total renin ratio. the model included
treatment (placebo,  xxxd113xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx ), time (h4,  xxxg1956xxx ,
 xxxd638xxx  and h48) and their interaction as fixed effects and
the baseline value as the covariate. period and carry-over
effects were tested and excluded from the model when
not significant. if a significant interaction was obtained in
f-tests (p < 0.05), treatments were compared in pairs,
using holm correction.
analysis of inter-assay reliability

an intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for
each treatment ( xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx ) to assess agreement between the two assays. agreement was assessed
visually, by plotting the concentrations obtained with the
two assays against each other, and the line corresponding
to equal concentrations in both assays. a bland–altman
plot was also drawn, with the mean difference between
the two assays  2 sd as the limits of agreement. all data
analyses were carried out with sas software (sas institute inc., cary, north carolina, usa). p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

inter-assay reliability for the cisbio and nichols assays,
after the oral administration of 160 mg  xxxd3487xxx  or
300 mg  xxxd113xxx  to sodium-depleted healthy subjects

similar plasma active renin concentrations were obtained
with both assays for plasma samples collected before
treatment (p ¼ ns) and after  xxxd3487xxx  (160 mg) administration (p ¼ ns; fig. 1). by contrast, significantly higher
immunoreactive renin concentrations were obtained with
the nichols assay than with the cisbio assay for plasma
samples collected after  xxxd113xxx  (300 mg) administration
(p < 0.0001; fig. 1). this marked difference was
observed at peak plasma  xxxd113xxx  concentration
(306  136 ng/ml; 4 h after intake) and persisted at lower
plasma  xxxd113xxx  concentrations (11.3  3.9 ng/ml; 24 h
after drug intake) [12].
the bland–altman plot showed a systematic bias
towards higher values being obtained with the nichols
assay than with the cisbio assay following  xxxd113xxx 
administration (fig. 2a,c), with the recorded plasma
immunoreactive active renin concentrations being
1.75-fold higher (1.02–3.01) in the nichols than in the
cisbio assay after  xxxd113xxx  administration. the phenomenon was absent in one  xxxd113xxx -treated volunteer. in the
absence of this outlier, the line of identity between both

in active renin/total renin ratio after oral administration

plasma total renin concentration was found to have
increased similarly 12 h after the administration of
160 mg  xxxd3487xxx  or 300 mg  xxxd113xxx  (fig. 3). the values
were obtained with the cisbio kit and were significantly
higher following  xxxd113xxx  intake than  xxxd3487xxx  intake,
24 and 48 h after administration. the active renin/total
renin ratio increased following the stimulation of renin

release by  xxxd3487xxx  and  xxxd113xxx , and this ratio was
significantly higher after  xxxd113xxx  than after  xxxd3487xxx 
administration (fig. 3).

discussion
the two immunoradiometric assays studied here, which
measure plasma active renin concentration, gave similar
results over a large range of values, from 1.3 pg/ml before
treatment to 2485 pg/ml after  xxxd3487xxx  administration.
however, following the oral administration of the renin
inhibitor,  xxxd113xxx , the nichols assay gave much higher
values than the cisbio assay. this difference was
observed at maximum plasma concentrations of the drug
(cmax of  xxxd113xxx  ¼ 306  106 ng/ml) and persisted for
several hours, after drug intake, at much lower plasma
 xxxd113xxx  concentrations.

of renin inhibitors to plasma, as previously reported with
 xxxd3095xxx  and s4385, were also observed with  xxxd113xxx ,
in both assays. at  xxxd113xxx  concentrations between 1 and
100 mmol/l, the values for immunoreactive plasma active
renin concentration obtained in vitro were higher in the
nichols assay than in the cisbio assay. the two assays
differ in the monoclonal antibodies used and in incubation conditions. the cisbio assay involves a 3-h incubation at room temperature with shaking whereas the
nichols assay involves a 24-h incubation without shaking.
deinum et al. [7] showed that the formation of open
prorenin, leading to the recognition of a small fraction of
prorenin (0.5–2%) with the nichols kit, can be prevented
by incubating samples for 6 h at 378c. as demonstrated
with plasma 3, if incubation time was increased from 3 to
24 h for the cisbio kit, then modified prorenin recognition levels are similar to those observed with the
nichols kit. long periods of incubation at room temperature enhance the recognition of modified prorenin by the
second iodinated antibody. the assay is based on this
second antibody recognizing active renin immobilized by
the primary antibody, which recognizes both active renin
and prorenin.
the higher values obtained in the nichols assay at times
when circulating  xxxd113xxx  concentrations were below
those required to modify prorenin conformation in vitro
suggest, for the first time, that the phenomenon described by derkx et al. [1] in vitro may operate in vivo.
prorenin molecules with a modified conformation,
strongly bound to the renin inhibitor, may persist in
the bloodstream long after the peak concentration of
 xxxd113xxx  has been reached. a higher plasma active/total
renin ratio is expected after any acute stimulation of renin
release [17], and this preferential increase in active renin

is observed both after  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx . it is much
more marked 12, 24 and 48 h after oral  xxxd113xxx  intake in
the cisbio assay with a 3-h incubation period, which
suggests that changes in the conformation of prorenin
in the presence of a renin inhibitor may either affect the
results of the cisbio assay with a 3-h incubation period,
although less than with the nichols kit, or occur before
incubation in vitro.
the long duration of action of  xxxd113xxx  on plasma
immunoreactive active renin concentration cannot be
solely attributed to an overestimation of its measurement,
instead of a prolonged release of renin induced by the
decrease in  xxxg99xxx  levels following renin inhibition [18]. indeed, plasma  xxxg99xxx  concentration
was significantly lower 24–48 h following administration
of a single oral dose of 300 mg  xxxd113xxx  than after placebo
[12,19]. trypsin-activated plasma renin (total renin) concentration was higher after  xxxd113xxx  than after  xxxd3487xxx ,
for up to 48 h after administration, and urinary aldosterone concentration was lower 18–24 h after  xxxd113xxx  than
after  xxxd3487xxx  administration [12]. moreover,  xxxd113xxx 
has been shown to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients 24 h after intake [19,20], and to be more
effective on both plasma active renin and blood pressure
at daily doses of 300 and 600 mg than irbesartan at a
150 mg daily dose [21].
perspectives and conclusion

these observations have two different implications. the
first implication concerns the interpretation of immunoreactive active renin measurements during renin inhibition.  xxxg99xxx  trapping assays have been shown to
be necessary to avoid overestimating plasma renin inhibition by the most widely used in-vitro methods for

assessing plasma renin activity [18,22–24]. similarly, the
method used to quantify immunoreactive active renin in
plasma must be carefully chosen and defined with care.
this is particularly true if the aim is to compare the
intensity and duration of renin–angiotensin system
blockade by different methods (angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibition,  xxxg99xxx  antagonism and renin
inhibition) at the site of the juxtaglomerular cells where
these blockers dose-dependently inhibit angiotensin
ii-renin feedback and increase total renin concentration
[25,26]. second, if renin inhibitors not only block the
enzymatic activity of renin in vivo, but also change the
conformation of prorenin, then they may also modify
renin metabolism [27] and binding to various receptors,
including the  xxxd1292xxx /insulin-like growth
factor 2 receptor [17,28] or the renin receptor [29].
