differential metabolism of dihomo-gamma- xxxd2490xxx  and  xxxd208xxx  by cyclo-oxygenase-1 and cyclo-oxygenase-2: implications for cellular s...  prostaglandin (pg) e(1) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties and to modulate vascular reactivity. these activities are sometimes distinct from those of pge(2), suggesting that endogenously produced pge(1) may have some beneficial therapeutic effects compared with pge(2). increasing the endogenous formation of pge(1) requires optimization of two separate processes, namely, enrichment of cellular lipids with dihomo-gamma- xxxd2490xxx  (20:3 n-6;  xxxd1886xxx ) and effective cyclo-oxygenase-dependent oxygenation of substrate  xxxd1886xxx  relative to  xxxd208xxx  (aa; 20:4 n-6).  xxxd1886xxx  and aa had similar affinities (k(m) values) and maximal reaction rates (v(max)) for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), whereas aa was metabolized preferentially by cyclo-oxygenase-1 (cox-1). to overcome the kinetic preference of cox-1 for aa, cp-24879, a mixed delta(5)/ xxxg758xxx  inhibitor, was used to enhance preferential accumulation of  xxxd1886xxx  over aa in cells cultured in the presence of precursor gamma- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3 n-6). this protocol was tested in two cell lines and both yielded a  xxxd1886xxx /aa ratio of approx. 2.8 in the total cellular lipids. from the enzyme kinetic data, it was calculated that this ratio should offset the preference of cox-1 for aa over  xxxd1886xxx . pge(1) synthesis in the  xxxd1886xxx -enriched cells was increased concurrent with a decline in pge(2) formation. nevertheless, pge(1) synthesis was still substantially lower than that of pge(2). it appears that employing a dietary or a combined dietary/pharmacological paradigm to augment the cellular ratio of  xxxd1886xxx /aa is not an effective route to enhance endogenous synthesis of pge(1) over pge(2), at least in cells/tissues where cox-1 predominates over cox-2.
