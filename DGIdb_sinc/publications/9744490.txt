abstract
synthetic and naturally occurring steroids exert a variety of neural effects that include modulation of
nocturnal sleep. the present study focuses on the effect of  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) activation on
the nocturnal sleep electroencephalogram (eeg) in male volunteers. as a pr ligand, the synthetic
progesterone  xxxd2557xxx  was used, which has the advantage over progesterone in that it is not
metabolized into other steroid compounds which could cloud the progesterone-mediated effects
through their own neuroactive properties. nine healthy male volunteers were investigated in a
prospective single-blind randomized study design. they received either placebo tablets or  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate dosages of 160, 320 or 480 mg at 14.00 h and 19.00 h. blood samples were drawn halfhourly from 22.00 h until 07.00 h. after 320 mg  xxxd2557xxx , plasma  xxxg1801xxx  secretion was
lower and growth hormone secretion was higher than after 160 mg and 480 mg  xxxd2557xxx  or
placebo. similarly, the reduction in the relative amount of rapid eye movement sleep was most
pronounced after 320 mg. thus,  xxxg1737xxx  activation, as reflected by the sleep eeg and
associated pituitary hormone secretion, follows a nonlinear u-shape dose dependency of a welldefined pr ligand, which may explain the unresolved inconsistencies of neuroendocrine
progesterone effects to date. moreover, employing a cv1 cell line, contransfected with a human
 xxxg1601xxx  expression vector and a reporter gene-based detection system for
transcriptional activity, revealed that a pr agonist such as  xxxd2557xxx  may also activate
glucocorticoid receptors. this may account for some of the neuroendocrine effects of  xxxd2557xxx  and
other progestins.

steroids exert pronounced regulatory influences upon the
central nervous system, including specific effects on sleep
architecture and concomitant hormonal secretion. several
naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives of adrenocortical steroids have been investigated to assign the sleependocrine effects to either the mineralocorticoid (mr) or the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr) (1–4). gr antagonists, such as
mifepristone (5), also bind at progesterone receptors (pr)
and pr agonists such as medroxyprogesterone also bind at
gr (6, 7), which complicates the allocation of distinct
physiological and behavioural effects to specific receptors.
despite a large data base of experiments in animals and
investigations in humans, the impact of progesterone on
sleep-electroencephalogram (eeg) effects remains uncertain
because of conflicting findings at all plasma concentration
ranges. at very low concentrations, no correlation of plasma
progesterone levels with the sleep–wake cycle is detectable in
males (8). some reports indicate that an increase of endogenous progesterone during the late luteal phase of the menstrual

cycle coincides with a rapid eye movement (rem ) sleep
reduction, and that shallow sleep is increased (9–12).
however, other investigations failed to find such an association (13, 14). studies during the last trimenon of pregnancy,
where plasma progesterone concentrations are much higher
than in the luteal phase, also failed to produce consistent
results (15–17). those studies that found an association
between sleep-eeg stages and plasma progesterone concentrations agree that progesterone reduces the amount of rem
sleep (9–12, 18).
 xxxd3023xxx  evokes a sleep-eeg pattern comparable to those of positive allosteric modulators of the gabaa
receptor. in rats, the amount of rem sleep and non rem
sleep was reduced (19). studies in man showed an increase
in shallow sleep and a nonsignificant reduction of rem sleep
(20). because of the fast kinetics of neuronal responses, it
was suggested that progesterone may act in the central
nervous system at the membrane level, as well as at nuclear
receptors, through certain metabolites that stereoselectively

modulate gaba receptor function and also regulate gene
a
expression via the pr (21).
to clarify the role of progestins upon sleep eeg and to
avoid a contamination of pr-mediated effects by neuronal
activities of steroids derived from naturally occurring progesterone, the present study used the synthetic progestin  xxxd2557xxx  (meg), which excludes such a possibility. we
chose to test two hypotheses: (i) that graded dosages of meg
dose-dependently influence hormonal secretion and sleep
architecture, and (ii) that a correlation between the effects
upon hormonal secretion and sleep eeg exists.
results
endocrine effects
multivariate analysis of variance (manova) of hormonal
secretion with the indicators auc (area under curve) and
ml (mean location, i.e. average of concentration values in a
given time interval ) revealed significant ‘treatment’, ‘time’ or
‘treatment by time’ effects for acth, cortisol and growth
hormone (gh ) [ wilk’s multivariate tests of significance;
‘treatment effect’ on acth and cortisol: min f(3, 6)=10.07,
p=0.042; ‘time effect’ on acth, cortisol and gh: min f(2,
7)=48.76, p<0.0001; ‘treatment by time’ effect on acth,
cortisol and gh: min f(3, 6)=30.15, p=0.009].

or the lower dosage and caused significantly higher auc and
ml values of gh secretion than pla in the first half of the
night (tests with contrasts, p<0.05).
sleep-eeg effects
application of one-factorial multivariate analysis of variance
with treatment as the ‘within-subjects’ factor to sleep-eeg
parameters of the total night resulted in significant main
effects for the parameter ‘treatment’ as shown in set a of
table 2 [ wilk’s multivariate test of significance; treatment
effect: f(12, 59)=2.06, p=0.040]. the following variables
contributed to the significant main trial effects: stage 2 sleep
and sws latency, which were significantly increased by meg
320 compared to pla, and the amount of rem sleep, which
was reduced by meg 320. by considering the eeg-sleep
parameters in the first and second halves of the night (set b),
the repeated measures in manova yielded both a significant
‘treatment’ and a significant ‘time’ effect [ wilk’s multivariate
test of significance; for both main effects p<0.05]. whereas
the treatment effect emerged only for the amount of rem
sleep, a time effect (differences between 1st and 2nd halves of
the night) was also obvious for the parameter sws. for the
amount of rem sleep, the significant treatment differences
were located between meg 320 and pla. in the first half of
the night, a marginal increase of time awake was observed
also, but failed to reach statistical significance.

acth and cortisol
as shown in fig. 1 and table 1, until 03:00 h no treatment
effects became obvious for acth and cortisol. comparison
of the different conditions in the second time interval
(03:00–07:00 h) revealed the regular circadian secretory profile of acth for the placebo condition, followed by that of
cortisol, with an increase beginning at 03:00 h in the morning
(fig. 1). administration of meg 160 delayed the spontaneous morning rise of plasma acth and cortisol concentrations by approximately 150 min, whereas the higher dosages
meg 320 and meg 480 abolished the morning rise totally.
the medium dosage (meg 320) suppressed circulating
plasma acth and cortisol concentations more potently than
the higher dosage of meg 480 as indicated by the area
values in table 1 and fig. 2. comparing the auc and ml
values of the 2nd time interval, a tendency to a ‘u-shaped’
dose response can be observed. for acth, only meg 320
led to a pronounced and significant reduction compared to
pla, meg 160 and meg 480. polynomial contrasts in
manova revealed a nonlinear dose effect of meg on
acth and a linear effect on cortisol. compared with pla,
meg 160, meg 320 and meg 480 led to a significant
reduction of cortisol (tests with contrasts; p<0.05), with no
statistical difference between the two larger meg dosages.
growth hormone
administration of meg induced an increase of gh secretion
during the first half of the night (fig. 1). evaluation of the
different effects of the three dosages on gh secretory activity
revealed an inverted ‘u-shaped’ dose response of meg:
again, the 320 mg dosage was more effective than the higher

transcriptional activity of  xxxd2557xxx  via corticosteroid
receptors
the genomic effects of  xxxd2557xxx  via the hgra and
the hmr were determined by assessing the potency of the
steroids to induce transcription through the hormoneresponsive mtv promoter. the respective steroid receptor
expression vectors were cotransfected with the mtv-luc
reporter gene in the monkey kidney cell line cv-1. in this
system, the agonistic activity of steroids is proportional to
the induction of the mtv promoter as measured by the
extent of luciferase production in the cells. using expression
vectors for the hgra and the hmr, we obtained dose
response curves for  xxxd2557xxx .  xxxd2557xxx 
displayed a clear agonistic activity via the hgra (fig. 3).
such an effect could first be detected at a 10 nm concentration
and was at a maximum at 100 nm. however, the hmr was
not responsive to  xxxd2557xxx  at either concentration
(data not shown).
discussion
one important result of our study is that the endocrine effects
of the different meg dosages reveal a nonlinear dose
response. the medium dose of 320 mg exerted the most
pronounced inhibitory effects on acth and cortisol secretion
and the most stimulatory effect on gh secretion.
progesterone, as well as several synthetic derivatives such
as meg, exert partial agonistic effects at gr (22–27). these
reported findings are supported by our transfection experiments indicating a strong gr agonistic activity of meg:

f. 2. the secretion of acth, cortisol and growth hormone (gh ) as indicated by the area values (mean±sem ) for the whole night from 23:00
to 07:00 h. area values for acth are expressed as pg×min per ml×30, cortisol and gh are expressed as ng×min per ml×30.

mately 25% of the maximum effects of both cortisol and
dexamethasone, i.e. a 250 vs 900-fold induction (28).
considering the impact of bioavailability and compartiment distribution on plasma levels of meg after oral
administration in the sleep-endocrine experiments, approximated plasma concentrations of maximum 100–300 nm meg
are achieved which correspond well to the concentration
range in the transfection experiments. since the existence of
pr at the anterior pituitary is unproven to date, the observed
neuroendocrine effects of meg can be explained by a stimulation of gr at the corticotrophs, suppressing acth and to
a lesser extent cortisol, and curtailing the morning rise of
these hormones. the stimulative effects of meg on the
release of gh resemble the effects obtained after administration of dexamethasone (29). treatment with dexamethasone
was reported to increase the  xxxg892xxx  capacity (30) and gh gene expression (31)
and to result in a down-regulation of somatostatin receptors
(32).
regarding sleep architecture, the major finding is that
meg mainly reduced the amount of rem sleep. in addition,
a nonsignificant enhancement of time awake, and an increase
of stage 2 sleep and the sws latency by meg 320 was
observed. interestingly, again a nonlinear dose response
emerged indicating that the 320 mg dosage was the most
effective in reducing rem sleep. meg is not quickly metabolized within a few hours because it contains an acid oxy
group in position 17a and a methylation in position 6, which
together with a double bond linkage leads to a considerable
inhibition of metabolization (33). therefore, the sleep-eeg
effects have to be explained by interaction with either pr or
gr, or both. studies investigating the sleep-eeg effects of

gr agonists such as cortisol or dexamethasone also consistently showed a decrease in the amount of rem sleep (1–4,
33–35). intravenous administration of progesterone promoted sleep in rats (36), cats (37) and monkeys (38).
moreover, the highest meg dose used in the current study
reduced the time until sleep onset markedly. however, unlike
gr agonists, the reduction of rem sleep was associated
rather with increased shallow sleep (the amount of sleep
spent in stage 2) than with an increase in sws as reported
for more potent gr agonists. hence, the sleep-eeg effects
of meg appear to be composed of gr agonistic effects in
combination with agonistic effects at pr.
the nonlinear dose response observed in our experiments
for both endocrine and sleep-eeg effects remains to be
clarified. it may be that at higher dosages meg interferes
with other steroid receptors (39), which could either influence
the regulation of hormonal secretion and sleep or lead to a
different occupation of pr and gr. another explanation
might be that at higher plasma meg concentrations a
desensitization of pr occurs, which buffers the effects of the
high meg dose. also unresolved is the observation that the
highest meg dosage largely suppressed cortisol, but affected
acth to a lesser extent.
it was reported that  xxxd3023xxx  antagonizes mr,
thus enhancing hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal function (28).
in the cotransfection experiment reported here, such a possibility was excluded, which agrees with corresponding binding studies of other investigators (7, 37). also, the failure
of meg to affect the amount of sws makes an
mr-antagonistic effect of this steroid at the systemic level
unlikely, because canrenoate, a mr antagonist, unlike meg,
was found to suppress sws considerably. other mr ligands,

acetate (meg). individual plates of cv-1 cells were cotransfected with
5 mg b-galactosidase expression plasmid, 5 mg of the reporter plasmid
mtv-luc and 5 mg of hgr expression plasmid. transfected cells were
incubated with steroids at the indicated concentrations. the induction
of the mtv promoter was calculated from the relative light units (rlu )
measured in the individual cell extracts and the baseline activity of the
mtv promoter, equivalent to approximately 2,000 rlu, was set at 1.
the results are presented as the mean of three independent experiments
with a variation from the mean of less than 30%.

however, did not induce such effects, preventing a established
conclusion about the extent to which meg treatment may
have produced some of its effects through disruption of the
mr/gr balance. in cells coexpressing both steroid receptor
subtypes, any alteration of the relative gr vs mr occupancy
results in a differing composition of nuclear homo- or heterodimerization (40) and in different systemic consequences,
including alteration of sleep physiology (41).
the data reported here suggest that pr agonists such as
meg exert their neuroendocrine and sleep-modulatory effects
not only through pr activation, but also through their
agonistic action on gr. because of this unspecificity, different
affinities of meg to steroid receptors may explain the
nonlinear dose effects. the clinical implications of this finding
include consideration of systemic effects through grs whenever synthetic progestins are used as treatment.

(63–75 kg) were investigated by our sleep research unit. each subject was
given a thorough medical examination and received a semistructured interview.
individuals with drug abuse, a personal or familial history of psychiatric
disorders or a recent stressful life event were excluded. subjects who complained of symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea or sleep-associated movement
disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, were not included. furthermore,
none of the participants had been subjected to sleep deprivation, had
consumed alcohol during the 2 days preceding polysomnography, or had
excessive coffee (restricted to 150 ml in the morning) or nicotine intake
(restricted to 3 cigarettes on the day before investigation), and had carried
out no shift work or time shifts during the 3 months preceding the study

all subjects were examined under video observation in a sound-shielded room
in our sleep research unit. they slept for two nights in a row on four
occasions, each occasion separated at least by 1 week. the first night of each
trial served for habituation to the experimental setting, including attachment
of the electrodes and cannulation of a forearm vein to evaluate needle effects.
in a prospective, single-blind setting the volunteers received either placebo
(pla), 160 mg  xxxd2557xxx  (meg 160), 320 mg (meg 320) or 480 mg
(meg 480) in randomized order. to assure constant plasma levels of meg
during the investigation night, the dosage of meg 160 or pla tablets was
divided and given repeatedly at 14:00 h and 19:00 h. at 18:00 h, all volunteers
had an electrolyte- and calorie-balanced standard meal. at 19:30 h, an
intravenous cannula was placed into a forearm vein, connected to a long
piece of tubing. a saline infusion of 0.9% nacl at 70 ml/h was given to keep
the line patent. blood samples were drawn every 30 min from 22:00 h to
7:00 h via the line to avoid direct manipulation in the investigation room.
the eeg electrodes were attached at 22:00 h. the subjects were allowed to
sleep between 23:00 h ( lights off ) and 7:00 h ( lights on).  xxxd2557xxx 
was obtained from bristol-myers squibb gmbh, munich, germany.
sleep-eeg analysis
sleep polygraphs of the respective nights were recorded by visual scores
according to standard procedures. the scoring was done by a trained
technician unaware of the experimental design. the sleep-eeg parameters,
i.e. sleep continuity parameters [sleep period time, sleep efficiency index, sleep
onset latency, slow wave sleep (sws) latency] and sleep structural parameters
[time awake, stage 2 sleep, sws and rapid eye movement (rem ) sleep] that
were routinely calculated have been described in detail elsewhere (41–43).
hormonal measurements
plasma cortisol concentrations were analysed using a commercially available
radioimmuno assay kit with coated tube technique ( icn biomedicals, carson,
ca, usa). the detection limit was 0.3 ng/ml plasma, intra and interassay
coefficients of variation for 20 and 40 ng/ml levels were below 7%.
immunoradiometric assays without extraction procedures were used (nichols
institutes, san juan capistrano, ca, usa) for acth and growth hormone
(gh ) measurements. our detection limit for acth was 3.5 pg/ml; and the
intra and interassay coefficients of variation at 20 pg/ml plasma were below
8%. for growth hormone, the minimum detectable amount was 0.2 ng/ml
plasma; both coefficients of variation were below 8% at 5 ng/ml plasma.
cell culture and transfection
cv-1 cells (monkey kidney) were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem ) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped steroid-free fetal calf serum for reporter gene assays (21,
44). transfections were performed using an electroporation system
(biotechnologies & experimental research inc., san diego, ca, usa) after
determination of the optimal electric field strength (21, 45). five mg reporter
gene, the mouse mammary tumour virus promoter upstream of the luciferase
gene (mtv-luc ), and 5 mg receptor expression vector were cotransfected
with 5 mg pch110 (pharmacia lkb, freiburg, germany), an sv 40 promoterdriven b-galactosidase expression vector. electroporated cells were replated
in phenol red-free dmem supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped steroidfree fetal calf serum and immediately incubated with various concentrations
of steroids within the range 0.01–1,000 nm. after 24 h, cells were harvested
and extracts were assayed for luciferase (21, 46) and b-galactosidase (21, 47)
activity to check for transfection efficiency. the construction of the plasmid
mtv-luc (48) and expression vectors for the human  xxxg1601xxx 
(hgra) (49) and the human  xxxg1602xxx  (hmr) (44) have
been described previously.
statistical methods
for comparison of parameters of hormonal secretion and for comparison of
sleep-eeg variables, a two-factorial multivariate analysis of variance with
repeated measures design was applied (manova). thereby treatment and
time were two within-subjects factors with four levels (pla, meg 160, meg
320, meg 480) and two levels [time intervals 23:00 h–03:00 h (first half of

726 dose response of  xxxd2557xxx 
the night) and 03:00 h–07:00 h (second half of the night)], respectively. areas
under the curve (auc ) calculated according to the trapezoid rule and mean
locations (ml) in each of the two time intervals were used for the description
of hormonal secretion instead of concentration values at the various time
points. mean hormonal concentrations at the various single time points were
compared between trials only at the exploratory level. in the case of significant
trial or time effects, subsequent univariate f-tests within manova were
used to identify those variables that contributed to these effects. pairwise
differences between the treatments or the time intervals were finally analysed
and tested in manova with contrasts. the univariate f-tests and tests with
contrasts were performed at a reduced level of significance, corrected by the
bonferroni procedure. as a nominal level of significance, we accepted a=0.05.
