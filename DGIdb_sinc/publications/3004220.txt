ann arbor, michigan
to study possible cellular antigonadotropic effects of  xxxd1806xxx , monolayer cultures of anterior pituitary cells
from immature female rats were treated with  xxxd1806xxx . measurements of luteinizing hormone release in
response to 10- 8 mol/l  xxxg930xxx  challenge and iodine 125-labeled gonadotropinreleasing hormone binding activity were done after exposure to increasing concentrations of  xxxd1806xxx  and
for increasing lengths of time. it was found that luteinizing hormone secreted by pituitary cells in response
to  xxxg930xxx  was inhibited after  xxxd1806xxx  treatment in a dose- and time-dependent
manner when compared to controls. also, a 45% decrease in  xxxg931xxx 
binding capacity was observed in pituitary cells cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of
 xxxd1806xxx  in the range of 10- 8 to 10- 4 molll when compared to controls. furthermore, exposure to  xxxd1806xxx 
for 25 to 96 hours caused a marked decrease in  xxxg930xxx  binding activity
(p < 0.005). under these experimental conditions  xxxd1806xxx  treatment decreased the pituitary receptors for
 xxxg930xxx  in a dose- and time-dependent manner. scatchard analysis of saturation
curves for the binding of  xxxg930xxx  to cellular  xxxg930xxx 
receptors indicated that the observed decrease in  xxxg930xxx  binding in the danazoltreated group was due to a change in the number of  xxxg930xxx  binding sites rather
than a change in the affinity. it is therefore concluded that the antigonadotropic activity of  xxxd1806xxx  appears
to be related to a decrease in  xxxg930xxx  receptors in the pituitary. (am j osstet

 xxxd1806xxx , a synthetic heterocyclic steroid, chemically
related to 17u-ethinyl testosterone, has received wide
attention because of its various endocrine properties.1. 2 since the introduction of  xxxd1806xxx  in 1971 the
medical management of endometriosis has been significantly advanced. there are at least four pharmacologic mechanisms by which  xxxd1806xxx  might exert its
therapeutic effects: (1) direct inhibition of  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh)" and gonadotropin secretion: (2) interaction with intracellular androgen and

metabolism. 7
our previous studies, which used pituitary cells in
culture as a model system, have shown that one of the
effects of  xxxd1806xxx  is directly antigonadotropic, inhibiting the responsiveness of the anterior pituitary with
respect to gnrh-induced luteinizing hormone release. 8 the purpose of the present study was to further
investigate the mechanism of this inhibition to determine whether the antigonadotropic activity of  xxxd1806xxx 
is related to alteration in the number of gnrh receptors in the pituitary.

for radioimmunoassay were generously provided by
the hormone distribution program of the national institute of arthritis, diabetes, and kidney diseases. reagents for cell culture were obtained from
grand island biological company (grand island, new
york). the nondegradable analog of gnrh, desglylo[d-ala6 ]gnrh ethylamide, was purchased from
beckman instruments, inc. (palo alto, california).  xxxg1338xxx , dowex 50-w, and cm cellulose were obtained from sigma chemical company (st. louis, missouri), glucose oxidase from miles laboratories, inc.,

anterior pituitary cell culture. the cell cultures
were prepared by the procedure described by vale et
al. 9 with minor modifications. briefly, anterior pituitaries were removed from immature female rats and were
placed in ca2+ - and mg2+ -free earle's  xxxd2988xxx . after mincing and rinsing with earle's solution,
the tissue was incubated at 37° c with stirring in earle's
solution containing 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (crystalline, miles laboratories, elkhart, indiana), 0.3% collagenase (type i, worthington biochemical corporation, freehold, new jersey), and 0.1 % hyaluronidase
(worthington) for 60 to 75 minutes followed by treatment with 0.25% pancreatin (grand island biological)
for 15 minutes. after three rinsings the cells were suspended in medium at a final concentration of 5 x 10 5
cells per milliliter; 2.0 ml of this suspension (10 6 cells)
were plated to tissue culture dishes (35 x 10 mm, falcon plastics, oxnard, california) and maintained at 37°
c in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air/5% carbon dioxide. cell attachment occurred 48 hours after
plating. the medium used for culture was dulbecco's
modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10%
horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mmol/l nonessential amino acids, glutamine, gentamicin (50 j,l-gi
ml), and  xxxd2761xxx  (10 iu/ml) (supplemented dulbecco's modified eagle's medium). the sera were previously treated with dextran coated charcoal to remove
endogenous steroids.
after 2 days of culture the medium was replaced with
supplemented dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
containing danazo!.  xxxd1806xxx  was dissolved in 70% ethanol; final concentration of ethanol was 0.5%, which
was also included in the control cultures. for luteinizing
hormone release studies, after incubation for indicated
times with the test substance, the cultures were washed
with medium and challenged for 4 hours in dulbecco's
modified eagle's medium containing 10- 8 molll of
gnrh. at the end of this incubation period the media

receptors. at the end of incubations, as described in
each experimental protocol in the figure legends, the
cultured cells were washed twice with dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, scraped free with a rubber policeman, and transferred to 12 x 75 mm glass tubes at
a concentration of approximately 2 x 106 cells per
tube. preparation of radioiodinated d-ala 6 gnrh for
use as radioligand was performed by the  xxxg1338xxx  method. ii. the specific activity of the labeled peptide ranged from 850 to 1500 j,l-ci/j,l-g.
the assay for gnrh receptors was performed as
follows l2 : 50,000 cpm of [ 125 i]d_ala6 gnrh (approximately 10- 11 mol/l) were incubated with approximately
2 x 106 pituitary cells for 80 minutes at 22°. nonspecific binding was determined in the cells incubated with
tracer and excess unlabeled ligand (2 x 10- 5 moill).
specific binding was assessed by subtracting nonspecific
binding from the total binding. incubations were performed in a total volume of 0.3 ml of assay buffer
(dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, 0.1 % bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 25 mmol/l of n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes) with 0.5
mmolll of bacitracin, ph 7.4) and terminated with 2
ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (ph
7.4) followed by immediate filtration under vacuum
through glass fiber filters (whatman gf/c, whatman,
inc., clifton, new jersey) presoaked in i % bovine  xxxg124xxx  in phosphate-buffered saline solution, in
a multi phase holder. the filters with pituitary cells were
washed three times with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered
saline solution, and bound radioactivity was determined
in a gamma spectrometer. to study the effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on  xxxg931xxx  content and affinity, pituitary
cells after  xxxd1806xxx  treatment were incubated with
50,000 cpm of radioiodinated d-ala6 gnrh and increasing concentrations of unlabeled analog from 0.25
to 2.25 mmol/l in the absence or presence of a 1000fold excess of unlabeled analog. the amount of gnrh
bound to the cells was determined at each point.

of each exposure time, media were replaced with dulbecco's

dioimmunoassay. it can be observed in table i that
 xxxd1806xxx  treatment of the pituitary cells significantly inhibited the gnrh-stimulated luteinizing hormone release in a dose-dependent manner when compared to
controls.
the time course for  xxxd1806xxx  effect on pituitary cell
responsiveness to gnrh with respect to luteinizing hormone release was then examined (fig. i). cultures were
exposed to 5 x 10- 6 molll of  xxxd1806xxx  for increasing
lengths of time, from 6 to 48 hours, after which luteinizing hormone released in response to a 10- 8
mol/l of gnrh challenge was measured. the results
demonstrate a significant, progressive decline in luteinizing hormone secretion in response to gnrh as
the duration of exposure to  xxxd1806xxx  is increased. after
48 hours of  xxxd1806xxx  exposure, luteinizing hormone response was 30% of controls (p < 0.005). thus pretreatment with  xxxd1806xxx  causes a decreased responsiveness
to gnrh for luteinizing hormone release in a time and
concentration dependent manner.

further experiments were performed to determine
whether the decreased responsiveness of the pituitary

of pituitary receptors for gnrh. in the first experiment the cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd1806xxx  (10- 8 to 10- 4 moill) , after which

fig. 3. effect of increasing  xxxd1806xxx  exposure time on gnrh binding activity. pituitary cell cultures
were incubated with 40 flmolll of  xxxd1806xxx  or control diluent for increasing lengths of time as
indicated. at the end of each time period, cells were collected and gnrh binding studies were
performed as described in materials and methods (**p < 0.005 versus control at the same time
point).

the cells were collected and binding of [ '25 i]d_ala6 gnrh
was determined. as seen in fig. 2, there appears to be
a dose-related inhibitory effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on gnrh
binding activity, with a significant decrease (p < 0.005)
exhibited in those cultures exposed to 10- 5 and 10- 4
molll of  xxxd1806xxx .
the effect of  xxxd1806xxx  exposure on gnrh binding
capacity by pituitary cells was then determined. cultures were incubated with 40 jj.mol/l of  xxxd1806xxx  for
24, 48, and 96 hours, and the cells were collected and
gnrh binding assays were performed. as indicated in
fig. 3, there is a progressive decrease in gnrh binding
with longer exposure to danazoj, with a significant
(p < 0.005) decrease in binding activity in those cultures pretreated with  xxxd1806xxx  for 96 hours when compared to controls.

to determine whether the effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on
gnrh receptors was due to a change in the binding
affinity, control and  xxxd1806xxx -treated cells were assayed
for gnrh binding activity with ['25 i]d_ala 6 gnrh
(-10- ii molll) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled analog to approach saturation of the gnrh
receptor sites (fig. 4). these data were transformed
according to scatchard 14 to determine the diffusion
constant and the number of binding sites. the scatchard plots of the binding data gave two linear, parallel
lines suggesting that the observed decrease in gnrh
binding in  xxxd1806xxx -treated cells was due to a change in
the number of binding sites rather than a change in
the affinity. for control cells, the diffusion constant was
9.09 x 10- 10 mol/l and the binding capacity was 100

effect of  xxxd1806xxx  treatment on protein synthesis. to
determine whether  xxxd1806xxx  exposure affected protein
synthesis by the pituitary cell cultures, the incorporation of tritiated leucine into trichloroacetic acid precipitable proteins was measured. as can be seen in the
data presented in table ii, no appreciable change in
protein synthesis occurred in those cells treated with
 xxxd1806xxx . total cellular protein content also was similar
in control and  xxxd1806xxx -treated cultures.
comment

although  xxxd1806xxx  is widely used in the clinical management of a number of gynecologic and endocrine
disorders, the cellular mechanism of action of  xxxd1806xxx 
is not yet understood. however, its antigonadotropic
action has been widely recognized. the site of antigonadotropic action has been reported to be both at
the hypothalamic 15 and at the pituitary '6 level. we have
previously reported that exposure of rat anterior pituitary monolayer cell cultures to  xxxd1806xxx  in vitro
caused an inhibition of the responsiveness of the cells
to gnrh challenge for luteinizing hormone release in
a dose-related manner." additionally, those studies also
revealed that the inhibitory effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on luteinizing hormone release is not due to inhibition of
luteinizing hormone synthesis in the cell cultures but

to diminished responsiveness to gnrh. this brought
up the interesting possibility that  xxxd1806xxx  acts at the
pituitary level by inhibition of some step(s) involved in
the action of gnrh on the pituitary. the concentration
of  xxxd1806xxx  used in the present in vitro studies is slightly
higher than the blood concentrations of  xxxd1806xxx  in
women treated with a single 400 mg dose of the drug. 17
however, it is conceivable that the present concentrations may be achieved in therapeutic situations when
the treatment lasts for longer periods and consists of
higher doses. thus the concentration of the  xxxd1806xxx 
that produced the in vitro effect is comparable to that
seen in therapeutic situations.

menon, peegel, and katta

the present study clearly shows that exposure to
 xxxd1806xxx  decreases the number of gnrh receptors in
pituitary cell cultures, and this decrease is not due to
a change in the affinity of gnrh-receptor interaction.
the decrease in the binding of 125i-labeled gnrh is
not due to an adverse effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on the viability
of pituitary cells in culture, since no change was observed in amino acid incorporation into proteins or in
total protein content in  xxxd1806xxx -treated cells when compared to controls. that the inhibition of gnrh receptors is not due to nonspecific steroid effect of  xxxd1806xxx 
is also evidenced by the fact that incubation with cholesterol did not alter gnrh binding activity when compared to controls (data not shown).
the mechanism by which  xxxd1806xxx  exposure causes a
diminution in the number of gnrh receptors in the
pituitary is not currently understood. a number of possibilities may account for this decrease. first, it is possible that  xxxd1806xxx  may alter the  xxxg931xxx  turnover, so that the internalized receptors or newly synthesized gnrh receptors may not be recycled, thereby
preventing their entry into plasma membranes.
a second possibility is that  xxxd1806xxx  may selectively
inhibit synthesis of gnrh receptors in the gonadotrophs. since the concentration of gonadotrope is low
in relation to other cell types, it is possible that this
selective inhibition of the receptor protein(s) may not
be reflected when the effect of  xxxd1806xxx  was tested on
the total protein content in the cell. such a possibility
is therefore still likely although no change in total protein content was observed in the cultures after exposure
to  xxxd1806xxx . finally, it is also possible that  xxxd1806xxx  exposure might cause internalization of gnrh receptors,
thereby decreasing the total number of available cell
surface receptors. further studies are needed to examine these possibilities.
it can be concluded from these studies that in addition to direct inhibition of steroidogenesis in the
gonads 18 and adrenals,19  xxxd1806xxx  also causes a decrease
in gnrh responsiveness of the pituitary gland by decreasing the available gnrh receptors.
