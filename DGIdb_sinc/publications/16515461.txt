abstract: s- xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the polyamines
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx . polyamines are ubiquitous organic cations that are absolutely required for normal cell proliferation and differentiation.  xxxg152xxx  catalyzes decarboxylation of s- xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) which provides
aminopropyl groups for spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  synthesis. mammalian  xxxg152xxx  is produced as a proenzyme (38
kda) which is cleaved to form the alpha (30.7 kda) and beta (7.7 kda) subunits of the mature enzyme. it is here shown that the
catalytic activity of the enzyme was completely eliminated when lysine 12 was mutated to an arginine residue in the small
subunit; however, the proenzyme processing was not affected. on the other hand, mutations of other lysine residues
(lys45→arg and lys56 →arg) did not affect either the enzyme activity or the proenzyme processing. structure analysis
using swiss deep viewer v3.7 has indicated that arg in place of lys12 may eliminate  xxxg152xxx  activity by restricting
the mobility of thr85 through hydrogen bonding. sequence alignment of various  xxxg152xxx  sequences indicated that
thr85 is in a highly conserved region, suggesting that thr85 is critical for the decarboxylation reaction.

introduction
 xxxg152xxx  is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  [1]. it belongs to a small class of
decarboxylases which uses a covalently bound pyruvate as a
prosthetic group [2]. all known adometdcs are synthesized
as proenzymes. upon synthesis, the proenzyme undergoes an
autocatalytic cleavage reaction at an internal serine residue
to generate two nonidentical subunits termed alpha and beta [1].
human  xxxg152xxx  is synthesized as a 38 kda proenzyme
which is subsequently cleaved to from 30.7 (alpha) and 7.7 kda
(beta) subunits [3]. the pyruvate cofactor is simultaneously
formed from an internal serine residue, and remains covalently attached to the n-terminus of the large subunit [4].
the mature human  xxxg152xxx  is a heterodimer consisting
of these two non-identical subunits (i.e., alpha2beta2) [5].
the first step of  xxxg152xxx  catalysis is the binding of
substrate  xxxd3156xxx  through the pyruvate prosthetic group that
reacts to form a schiff base adduct with the substrate. the
pyruvoyl cofactor in this schiff base adduct linkage then acts
as an electron sink to aid in the breaking of the c-coobond and the elimination of co2 from the enzyme-substrate
complex. to release the final product, dcadomet, a protonation must occur at the alpha carbon of the product. through this
protonation, the pyruvate is regenerated and is available for
another cycle of catalysis [6].
processing and activity of the mammalian  xxxg152xxx 
and yeast enzymes is enhanced by the presence of putrescine
[7,8]. site-directed mutagenesis studies of the human
 xxxg152xxx  have indicated that the interaction of putrescine

with four acidic residues (glu11, glu178, glu256, and
asp174) is essential for the change in conformation that favors the processing reaction [9,10]. likewise, site-directed
mutagenesis has identified glu8, glu11, cys82, his127,
glu133, thr245, and glu256 to play important roles in
 xxxg152xxx  activity [4,9]. in addition, these results demonstrated that the small subunit is part of the active enzyme
complex, and in fact contains residues which play critical
roles in both processing and catalytic activity [11].
in this study, we demonstrate that mutating lys12 in the
small subunit to an arginine residue eliminated the catalytic
activity of the mature enzyme completely without any effect
on the proenzyme processing. in contrast, lys45→arg or
lys56→arg mutation did not affect either the enzyme activity or the proenzyme processing.
materials and methods
anti- xxxg152xxx  polyclonal antibody was generously
provided by dr. a. e. pegg, penn state university college
of medicine, hershey, pa, u.s.a. dna isolation kits were
purchased from qiagen (chatsworth,ca). [14cooh]
 xxxd3156xxx  was purchased from amersham. unless otherwise
mentioned, all other chemicals were obtained from fisher
(pittsburg, pa).
cell culture maintenance
cos-7 cells were maintained in dmem (plus 4.5 g/l
glucose) supplemented with 10% fcs, 2mm glutamine, 100
µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 u/ml penicillin in a humidified
atmosphere at 37oc with 5% co2. stock cultures were
maintained in 75 cm2 corning flasks, and experimental cultures were grown in 10 cm 2 or 6 cm 2 falcon plates. the cells
were subcultured when they were 70-80% confluent. after

inactivation of  xxxg152xxx 

aspirating the medium, the cells were washed twice with
pbs-edta solution, and incubated with 0.25% trypsin solution at room temperature for 3 min. trypsin was then removed and the cells were incubated for additional 10-12 min
at 37oc until the cells detach. fresh culture medium was
added and the cells were dispensed into new culture flasks.
western blotting
the ecf detection system (amersham) was utilized for
western blotting according to the manufacturer’s instructions. proteins were separated by sds-page [12] and transferred to pvdf membranes at 30v, 4oc overnight in the
transfer buffer. next morning, the transfer was continued at
90v for an additional hour. to detect  xxxg152xxx , the blots
were incubated with anti- xxxg152xxx  polyclonal antibody
(1:500 dilution) overnight in tris-buffered saline-tween 20
(tbs-t). the blots were then extensively washed with tbst and incubated with anti-rabbit alkaline-phosphataseconjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h.
the fluorescence developed was scanned with a molecular
dynamics' fluorimager, and specific bands were quantified
using imagequant software.

tion with same restriction enzyme (sca i). the digested dna
was then used to transform epicurian coli xl1-blue competent cells. plasmid dna from single colonies was purified
and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion for initial confirmation of positive clones. the positive clones were further
checked and confirmed for the desired mutations by dna
sequencing using an abi 737 automated sequencer at the
molecular genetics core facility of the hershey medical
center.
 xxxg152xxx  activity assay
to determine the activity of the mutants and wild type
his- xxxg152xxx , equal amounts of cell lysate were assayed
for  xxxg152xxx  activity by measuring the ability to convert
[14cooh] xxxd3156xxx  into 14co2 over an hour incubation at
37oc. the assay mix consisted of 1.25 mm dtt, 50 mm
sodium phosphate buffer ph 6.8, 2.0 mm putrescine and
3.84 µm [14cooh] xxxd3156xxx  (57 mci/mmol) in a total volume of 0.25 ml. the specific activity was calculated as the
amount of substrate converted (pmole) per mg of cell extract
in 1 h at 37oc [13].
structure analysis

plasmid construction
pqehissami plasmid containing his-tagged human
 xxxg152xxx  cdna was digested with xhoi and psti restriction enzymes, and the digested dna was electrophoresed on
0.8% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. the
dna fragment containing his-tagged human  xxxg152xxx 
cdna was cut out of the gel and put into spin-x centrifuge
filter. after centrifugation the eluted dna was precipitated
from 2m ammonium acetate plus 2.2 volumes of 100%
etoh. the dna pellet was washed with 70% etoh and
finally resuspended in double distilled h2o. the dna fragment was then ligated into the mammalian expression vector
pcdna3.1/zeo(-) which had been digested with the same
restriction enzyme. the ligation was carried out with t4
dna ligase overnight at 16oc.
site-directed mutagenesis
point mutations at selected lysine sites were introduced
into his- xxxg152xxx  using the chamelon site directed
mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions
(stratagene). the selection primer and all mutagenic primers
were synthesized at the macromolecular core facility of
penn state university hershey medical center: selection
primer, 5'-ctg tga ctg  xxxg889xxx  acg cgt caa cca
agt c-3' (which converted the unique sca i site to an mlu i
site); k12r, 5'-agg gac cga gag gct gct gga gg3'; k45r, 5'-cat act ttt gag gga tgt gca at-3';
k56r; 5'-aag tgt gac aag aac tga caa gc-3'.
briefly, the two primers (selection and mutagenic primer)
were annealed to the plasmid, then t7 dna polymerase and
t4 dna ligase were added to the mixture together with the
4 dntps. after 1 h at 37oc, the dna was digested with sca
i (12 units) at 37oc for 1 h. the digested dna mixture was
then used to transform competent xlmuts e. coli cells. to
increase the mutagenesis efficiency, the transformed cells
were incubated at 37oc with shaking overnight. plasmid
dna was purified from this culture and subjected to diges-

human  xxxg152xxx  structure coordinates (entrez structure: 1jen) were obtained from entrez's molecular modeling database. swiss deep viewer [14] was used to visualize
and analyze wild type and k12r mutant  xxxg152xxx . after
replacing lys12 with arginine, the energy minimization was
computed by the grosmos 96 implementation of swiss deep
viewer v3.7 to obtain a rotamer with no clashes with surrounding residues. the ramachandran plot was analyzed to
determine that psi, phi and gamma angles of arginine in place of
lysine 12 were within the allowed regions. potential hydrogen bonds between the arginine side chain and other parts of
the molecule were also determined and visualized with swiss
deep viewer. clustalw (available at the biology workbench package of san diego supercomputer center) was
used to determine the conserved residues between human,
yeast, potato and leishmania  xxxg152xxx  sequences using
the default parameters. multiple alignment output was colored with the boxshade program.
results
in a previous study, we demonstrated that  xxxg152xxx 
was ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26s proteasome [15].
in order to further clarify the proteolytic mechanism, several
critical lysine residues were selected and mutated to arginine
to determine which lysine served as the ubiquitin attachment
site for subsequent targeting to the 26s proteasome (polyubiquitin chains are commonly attached to a lysine residue on
a target protein [16]). mutations of k12r, k45r and k56r
were made and their activities were subsequently determined. the selected lysine residues were surface exposed
and replaced with arginine in order to keep the overall
charge unchanged. interestingly, the k12r mutation eliminated the catalytic activity completely (table 1) with no effect on the processing rate (as determined using western blot
analysis). on the other hand, the k45r or k56r mutations
had no effect on the processing, and only minimal effects on
activity (table 1). knowledge of the 3-d structure of a pro-

tein provides valuable understanding of the function of
amino acid residues critical for the enzymatic activity. initial
analysis of human  xxxg152xxx  3-d structure showed that
lys12 was not in a substrate access site, and therefore arginine in place of lysine could not cause the inactivation by
simply blocking substrate access to the active site. next, the
human  xxxg152xxx  model was mutated in silico by substituting the lysine at position 12 with arginine, with the k12r
mutant sequence subjected to energy minimization for
structural refinement using swiss deep viewer v3.7. no
substantial change was observed in the backbone of the
molecule compared with the wild type when two models
were superimposed. therefore, subsequent analyses were
performed on the side chain. the k12r substitution did not
disturb the two hydrogen bonds between residue 12 and
thr81; however, the substitution resulted in the formation of
a hydrogen bond between the side chain and thr85 (fig. 1a
and 1b), probably decreasing the mobility of thr85, which
also interacts with cys82, the proton donor during the decarboxylation of  xxxd3156xxx  [6]. to date no mutational analysis
has been carried out to determine whether the residue thr85
is critical for  xxxg152xxx  activity. sequence alignment of
various  xxxg152xxx  sequences have indicated that thr85 was
in fact in a highly conserved region (fig. 2), suggesting that
thr85 is probably critical for the activity. as expected,
lys12 was also in a conserved region but lys45 and 56 were
not conserved in  xxxg152xxx  sequences (fig. 2). using
swiss deep viewer v3.7, the lysine at position 45 was also
replaced with arginine, and the effect of this substitution on
the structure was examined. no difference on the backbone
interaction with several other residues (asp41, ile42 and
glu48) was observed as compared with the wild type; however, the analysis indicated that the arginine side chain in
place of the lysine forms a hydrogen bond with asp46 (data
not shown), which, as expected, was not conserved among
 xxxg152xxx  sequences (fig. 2).
discussion
previous studies have identified several key residues
critical for  xxxg152xxx  activity (e.g., glu11, cys82, his127
and glu256), [4,6,9] for putrescine stimulated processing
(e.g., glu11, glu256, and asp174), [9,10] for the proenzyme
processing site (the cleavage occurs at the sequence

lsessm between glu67 and ser68 in human  xxxg152xxx 
[17]), and for cys82 serving as the proton donor during decarboxylation reaction [6]. the evidence presented in the
current work shows that lysine 12 also plays an important
role in  xxxg152xxx  activity, whereas lysine 45 and 56 are not
essential for activity. the comparison of the mutant model
with the wild type structure indicated that the lys45→arg
substitution results in the formation of a hydrogen bond between the side chain and thr85. the mutant modeling also
indicated that thr85 interacts with cys82, the proton donor
during the decarboxylation of  xxxd3156xxx  reaction. therefore,
one possibility is that the mutation of k12r eliminated
 xxxg152xxx  activity by restricting the mobility of thr85 and
cys82, which subsequently interferes with the proton donation reaction. the protonation occurs at the alpha carbon of the
product, and through this protonation, the pyruvate is regen-

erated and is available for another cycle of catalysis [6]. in
the light of this evidence, it is therefore possible that the
dcadomet may never be released from the k12r mutant
enzyme and may remain covalently linked to the pyruvate
cofactor. further experiments will be required to test this
possibility.
many  xxxg152xxx  inhibitors have been developed and
used against various cancers and parasitic infections. however, many of these inhibitors have serious side effects and
developing specific and potent drugs is highly desirable. in
addition to the contributions to understanding the structurefunction relationships in enzyme activity, the evidence presented in this study provides an alternative target for the design of new inhibitors, where interaction of an inhibitor with
both thr85 and cys82 simultaneously may irreversibly and
more potently inactivate  xxxg152xxx .
