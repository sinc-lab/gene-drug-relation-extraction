objectives: the salicylate  xxxd2579xxx  is commonly used
for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, yet its
precise mechanism of action is unknown. because transcription factor nf-␬b plays an important role in inflammatory
bowel diseases, we investigated the effects of  xxxd2579xxx 
therapy on nf-␬b activation in patients with ulcerative
colitis.
methods: a total of 20 patients with moderately active
ulcerative colitis received  xxxd2579xxx  for 8 wk. biopsies
were taken before and after drug administration and analyzed for nf-␬b activation using an antibody specific for
active nf-␬b.
results: in biopsies of active ulcerative colitis but not in
noninflamed mucosa, activation of nf-␬b was detected
predominantly in macrophages.  xxxd2579xxx  therapy resulted
in a strong abrogation of nf-␬b activation in situ.
conclusions: our results suggest that the therapeutic
properties of  xxxd2579xxx  rely at least in part on the inhibition
of nf-␬b activation, resulting in the suppression of proinflammatory gene expression in the inflamed mucosa. (am j

introduction
derivatives of  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) are widely
used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease such
as ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease (1, 2). because of
its favorable safety profile and tolerability, sulfa-free  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) preparations are the preferred type
of medication. to deliver orally taken  xxxd2579xxx  down to the
inflamed intestinal mucosa for its topical action, two different modes of drug targeting have been created: either  xxxd2579xxx 
linked to a carrier molecule (prodrug), or specially coated
 xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) forming a delayed release formulation.
however, although  xxxd2579xxx  preparations are one of the most

effective drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory
bowel diseases, the mechanisms of molecular action by
which these salicylates exert their anti-inflammatory effects
are largely unknown (3).
recently it was suggested that the transcription factor
nf-␬b plays an important role in the inflammatory process
of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (4 – 8). nf-␬b designates a group of transcription factors consisting of different proteins including nf-␬b1 (p50), nf-␬b2 ( xxxg799xxx   xxxg1560xxx ), p65
(rela), c-rel, and relb, which share a common structural
motif called the rel homology domain (9 –11). the active
form of nf-␬b is a heterodimer that is frequently composed
of the p65 and p50 subunit. in nonstimulated cells, nf-␬b
is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a latent, inactive complex
bound to inhibitory proteins termed i␬b. many different
stimuli activate nf-␬b, including cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor (tnf) and interleukin (il)-1, lipopolysaccharides, bacterial and viral infections, activators of protein
kinase c, and oxidants (12). these stimuli induce the phosphorylation of i␬b by a multiprotein i␬b-kinase (ikk)
complex containing ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ (13, 14). this event
is followed by the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of i␬b at the proteasome, leading to the nuclear translocation of nf-␬b through the nls (nuclear location sequence) of its heterodimeric subunits. in the nucleus, nf-␬b
binds to specific consensus sequences in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby activating the transcription of
a wide spectrum of proinflammatory genes. for example,
nf-␬b is known to regulate the expression of a variety of
cytokines (tnf, il-1, il-2, il-6, and il-8) as well as
adhesion molecules (icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx ,  xxxg2048xxx , and
madcam-1) and certain enzymes involved in inflammation, such as  xxxg1578xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  (12, 15). as indicated above, some of the proteins
whose genes are switched on by nf-␬b, such as tnf and
il-1, are themselves strong activators of nf-␬b, giving the
potential of a positive amplification loop.

ajg – december, 2000

dysregulated expression of a number of nf-␬b target
genes, most prominently tnf, has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (16 –18). indeed, inhibition of nf-␬b activation using a selective proteasome inhibitor to prevent i␬b degradation attenuated
chronic inflammation in an experimental model of crohn’s
disease (19). furthermore, it has been shown that a single
local injection of antisense oligonucleotides for the p65
subunit of nf-␬b effectively abrogated colonic inflammation in different mouse models of colitis (6). thus, nf-␬b
activation and its subsequent transcriptional activation of
proinflammatory gene expression presumably occupy a critical position for the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal
inflammation.
the present study was designed to investigate the effect
of  xxxd2579xxx  therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis on
nf-␬b activation. because the activation of nf-␬b is regulated at the posttranslational level, it cannot be assessed by
measuring mrna or proteins levels in tissue biopsies. we
therefore employed an antibody that detects the nuclear
location sequence (nls) of the p65 subunit of nf-␬b,
which is normally masked by bound i␬b (20). thus, the
antibody exclusively detects activated nf-␬b and allows
the investigation of its activation state by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections. we show that in patients
with ulcerative colitis, mucosal nf-␬b activation is increased, particularly in macrophages. therapeutic administration of  xxxd2579xxx  indeed effectively downregulated the
activation of nf-␬b in these patients. our results therefore suggest that inhibition of nf-␬b activation may be
involved in the therapeutic and anti-inflammatory actions
of  xxxd2579xxx .

materials and methods
reagents
the mouse monoclonal antibody (igg3), which selectively
binds to the nls sequence of the activated p65 nf-␬b
subunit, was kindly provided by dr. h. stockinger (roche
molecular research, penzberg, germany). biotinylated
goat anti-mouse igg and peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complex were obtained from dako diagnostica gmbh
(hamburg, germany). cy3-conjugated f(ab⬘)2 goat antimouse igg was received from dianova (hamburg, germany). fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated anticd14 monoclonal antibody (igg2a) was purchased from
santa cruz biotechnology (heidelberg, germany). dimethylformamide, 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (aec) and hematoxylin solution were obtained from sigma (deisenhofen,
germany).
patients
we investigated 20 patients (female or male, 18 –70 yr of
age) with an acute episode of moderate ulcerative colitis

3453

(clinical activity index according to rachmilewitz 6 –12,
endoscopic index ⱖ4). the patients participated in a randomized, double-blind study investigating the therapeutic
effect of a newly developed  xxxd2579xxx . this formulation
consisted of  xxxd2579xxx  pellets with a particle size of ⬍2
mm coated with eudragit l (dr. falk pharma gmbh,
freiburg, germany). the patients received 1.5– 4.5 g/day
 xxxd2579xxx  but did not obtain any immunosuppressive
agents such as steroids, azathioprine, or  xxxd1781xxx  in the
last 4 wk before starting  xxxd2579xxx  administration. biopsies were taken from the affected colon of these patients
before and after  xxxd2579xxx  therapy. the clinical diagnosis
of active moderate ulcerative colitis and the remission due to
the  xxxd2579xxx  therapy were histologically confirmed by pathologists. histological assessment of the degree of inflammation correlated with the macroscopic tissue damage assessed
by endoscopy.
immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections
sections 4 ␮m thick were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated through degraded concentrations of ethanol. after blocking of endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol, the sections were incubated with
0.05% trypsin for 15 min at room temperature. after washing in pbs, nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) for 1 h. then the anti-p65
nf-␬b antibody (10 ␮g/ml) was added to the slides and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber.
after repeated washings in pbs, the sections were incubated
with biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (2 ␮g/ml) for
1 h. the sections were washed again and then covered for 30
min with an avidin-biotin complex reagent containing
horseradish peroxidase. finally, the sections were washed in
pbs and stained in freshly prepared substrate solution (4 mg
aec in 10 ml sodium acetate buffer ph 4.9, 500 ␮l dimethylformamide, 0.03%  xxxd2298xxx ) for 10 min. the
reaction was stopped by extensive rinsing in demineralized
water. alternatively, tissue sections were stained by the
immunofluorescence method using a cy3-conjugated second goat anti-mouse antibody (1 ␮g/ml). macrophages were
identified using fitc-conjugated anti-cd14 (1 ␮g/ml).
subsequently, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in glycerol/gelatin.
activation score
to allow a semiquantitative analysis of the number of
nf-␬b activated cells in the mucosa, we established an
activation score. positively stained cells were counted by
light microscopy with a 400-fold magnification. it was determined which percentage of cells was nf-␬b positive, and
the average of four microscopic fields was taken as the
activation score of the tissue section: 0 –1% (⫺), 2–5% (⫹),
5–10% (⫹⫹), and 10 –25% (⫹⫹⫹).

results
immunohistochemical identification of cells
containing activated nf-␬b in the inflamed mucosa
in initial experiments, we investigated nf-␬b activation in
tissue biopsies of ulcerative colitis in untreated patients with
a monoclonal antibody selective for the active form of the
p65 subunit of nf-␬b. figure 1a shows several nf-␬b
positive cells in the lamina propria of a patient with ulcerative colitis, detected with the indirect immunoperoxidase method. in contrast, either no or only little staining
was observed in noninflamed mucosal tissue obtained
from control individuals (fig. 1b). the immunoreaction
was specific for nf-␬b, as experiments including the
omission or preabsorption of the primary antibody with
the p65 nls peptide abolished the staining (data not
shown).
to identify the cell types in which nf-␬b was activated,
we employed fluorescent double labeling techniques. using

a fitc-labeled anti-cd14 antibody to identify macrophages
and a cy3-conjugated secondary antibody to detect activated nf-␬b, green and red fluorescence was observed in
very similar cell populations (fig. 2). the double staining
demonstrates that the cells containing activated nf-␬b were
mainly macrophages located in the lamina propria. in some
cases, single scattered nf-␬b positive cells were located in
or close to the epithelial tissue (data not shown).

before starting  xxxd2579xxx  administration. the extent of

patients before and after therapy are juxtaposed. note that  xxxd2579xxx  treatment almost completely abrogated nf-␬b activation.

nf-␬b activation was determined with an activation score
as outlined in materials and methods. it could be demonstrated that patients receiving oral  xxxd2579xxx  for 8 wk
clearly revealed a remission of their active moderate ulcerative colitis accompanied by a decreased or negative nf-␬b
activation score. figure 3a shows a patient with a moderate
nf-␬b activation score (⫹⫹) before  xxxd2579xxx  treatment,
which resulted in a negative activation score after 8 wk of
 xxxd2579xxx  therapy (fig. 3b). figure 3c also demonstrates
nf-␬b–positive cells in the lamina propria of a patient with
moderate ulcerative colitis. similarly to the staining pattern
of figure 2, nf-␬b positive cells seemed to be predominantly macrophages of the lamina propria (fig. 3a, c). in
some cases, endothelial and epithelial cells were also nf-␬b
positive. after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment, neither macrophages
nor epithelial cells revealed activated nf-␬b. in most cases
studied, we observed that  xxxd2579xxx  strongly inhibited
nf-␬b activation in situ. the activation score, which was

relatively high (50% of patients with an activation score of
⫹⫹ or ⫹⫹⫹) before beginning the therapy, decreased to
moderate (⫹, 20% of patients) or even negative levels (75%
of patients) after  xxxd2579xxx  therapy (table 1). these data
therefore clearly indicate that administration of  xxxd2579xxx 
inhibits nf-␬b activation in the mucosa of patients with
ulcerative colitis.

discussion
 xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) is an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used for the treatment, and the maintenance of remission, of active mild and moderate inflammatory bowel
diseases. among the known actions of  xxxd2579xxx  and other
salicylates are the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways to reduce the production of prostaglandins
and leukotrienes, as well as its scavenging effect of reactive
oxygen intermediates (1, 21, 22). recently, new mechanisms of drug action have been suggested. several reports
have shown that salicylates inhibit the activation of nf-␬b
and subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines
(23–27).
there is now increasing evidence that nf-␬b is centrally
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. first, as demonstrated in the present and in previous
studies, nf-␬b activation is strongly elevated in ulcerative

3456

bantel et al.

colitis and crohn’s disease (4, 5, 8). second, it was shown
in mouse models that p65 nf-␬b antisense oligonucleotides
efficiently prevented increased nf-␬b activation and cytokine production along with an efficient abrogation of clinical and histological signs of mucosal inflammation (6).
therefore, inhibition of nf-␬b activation may be a promising target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
in the present study, we show for the first time the
inhibition of nf-␬b activation in inflamed mucosa by a
salicylate compound. a total of 20 patients with active
moderate ulcerative colitis received  xxxd2579xxx  for 8 wk,
and biopsies were taken from the affected colon before and
after the  xxxd2579xxx  therapy. we clearly demonstrate an inhibitory effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on nf-␬b activation in these patients
that was in agreement with clinical observations, such as the
improvement of inflammatory symptoms including abdominal pains and diarrhea, and endoscopic observations including tissue damage. before  xxxd2579xxx  therapy, tissue sections of
patients with active ulcerative colitis showed areas of inflammation with nf-␬b–positive epithelial cells and macrophages. after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment, cells containing activated
nf-␬b were mostly completely absent. this prompt effect
of  xxxd2579xxx  treatment indicates that the anti-inflammatory
activity of  xxxd2579xxx  may at least partially be ascribed to
the inhibition of nf-␬b activation.
in our experiments, positively stained cells were mainly
found in the lamina propria, often located close to small
blood vessels. as identified by double-staining with anticd14, nf-␬b activation was predominantly localized in
macrophages. in addition, epithelial and endothelial cells
were found to stain positively to varying degrees. a similar
tissue distribution has been recently demonstrated in another
study investigating nf-␬b in inflammatory bowel diseases
(5). it was surprising to find that nf-␬b activation in vivo
seemed to be mainly restricted to macrophages and, to a
lesser extent, to other cells, given that in vitro nf-␬b is
activated in a variety of cell types. also in rheumatoid
arthritis, lymphocyte infiltrates have been recently found to
remain unstained for activated nf-␬b (28), indicating a
central role of macrophages in these chronic inflammations.
alternatively, lymphocytes may use alternative forms of the
nf-␬b heterodimer that do not contain p65 but rel-b or
other nf-␬b subunits and therefore escaped immunodetection. however, it should be noted that at least ex vivo–
derived peripheral lymphocytes activate nf-␬b p65 (29).
it has been shown previously that salicylates are able to
inhibit nf-␬b activation in several cellular systems. however, different mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in their inhibitory effect, which may depend on the
cell type or the nf-␬b activating stimulus. salicylates have
been found to stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase
p38 (30). it was proposed that p38 is involved in the inhibitory effects on nf-␬b, as a p38-specific inhibitor abolished
the prevention of nf-␬b activation by salicylates. furthermore, it has been suggested that  xxxd3219xxx  may
inhibit the protein synthesis of p65 nf-␬b while having no

ajg – vol. 95, no. 12, 2000

direct effect on the activation of the transcription factor (31).
in most studies, salicylates interfered with the activation of
nf-␬b by inhibiting i␬b degradation. it has been demonstrated that aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  inhibit the activity
of i␬b kinase-␤ because of their binding to the kinase,
which reduces atp binding and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of i␬b (32). it has also been reported
recently that  xxxd2579xxx  may directly inhibit i␬b kinase-␣ (33).
in view of the conflicting data concerning the molecular
mechanisms of salicylate action, we investigated the effect
of these drugs on nf-␬b activation in human colonic epithelial cell lines. in contrast to the efficient inhibition observed in vivo,  xxxd2579xxx  failed to inhibit inducible nf-␬b
activation in cell cultures (data not shown), which is in line
with previous reports (26, 34). the discrepancy between the
effect of  xxxd2579xxx  after administration in patients and incubation of cell cultures is currently under examination and
may be caused by cell type–specific differences in drug
action, the requirement of an intestinal environment, or
other factors. despite these open questions, our data clearly
demonstrate that  xxxd2579xxx  is a potent inhibitor of nf-␬b
activation in vivo, suggesting that inhibition of this crucial
inflammatory regulator may contribute to its therapeutic
efficacy. immunohistological detection of activated nf-␬b
in situ may serve as a diagnostic tool to monitor the therapeutic efficacy of salicylates and other newly developed
anti-inflammatory drugs.
