involvement of  xxxg1113xxx  in imipramine-induced
hyperglycemia in mice

effects of imipramine on plasma glucose levels were investigated
in mice. imipramine i. p. induced dose-dependent hyperglycemia, which was enhanced by pretreatment with 5-ht1/2/5/7 receptor antagonist  xxxd2621xxx  and 5-ht2a/2b/2c receptor antagonist ly 53 857. 5-ht2c/2b receptor antagonist sb 206 553 also
augmented imipramine-induced hyperglycemia although  xxxg1108xxx  and  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist (-)-propranolol, xxxg1113xxx  antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  and 5-ht3/4 receptor antagonist  xxxd3451xxx  each had no effect. imipramine i. p.-induced hyperglycemia was antagonized by the 5-ht2c/2b receptor agonist 1-(3chlorophenyl)piperazine (mcpp), while the  xxxg1114xxx  ago-

introduction
serotonergic mechanisms are involved in glucose homeostasis as
demonstrated by several reports that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) receptor agonists affect plasma glucose levels in
rats or mice. the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-npropylamino)tetralin(8-oh-dpat) elevates plasma glucose levels of rats and mice [1 ± 4].  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists including buspirone and ipsapirone also induce hyperglycemia in
rats [5 ± 6]. furthermore, hyperglycemic effects were elicited in
rats following the administration of a 5-ht2a/2c receptor agonist,
1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-aminopropane (doi), and a
5-ht2c/2b receptor agonist, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine
(mcpp), in rats [7 ± 8]. many antidepressants inhibit reuptake of
5-ht at nerve terminals and elevate 5-ht levels at synaptic cleft

nist bw 723c86 had no effect. intracerebroventricular injection
of imipramine also elevated plasma glucose levels, which is enhanced by sb 206 553. hyperglycemia elicited by central injection of imipramine was abolished by adrenalectomy. these results suggest that imipramine-induced hyperglycemia in mice is
related to its inhibition of the central  xxxg1115xxx . moreover,
our results indicate that adrenaline release is related to imipramine-induced hyperglycemia.

[9 ± 10]. we previously reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and  xxxd3555xxx 
induce hyperglycemia in mice, although the mechanisms for hyperglycemia elicited by these ssris may not be identical [11 ± 12].
imipramine, a tricyclic compound, is a widely used antidepressant and that is effective for several types of depression. imipramine inhibits reuptake of both 5-ht and noradrenaline at nerve
terminals [13]. it has been reported that imipramine may affect
glucose homeostasis. imipramine increases blood glucose levels
of animals and humans [14 ± 15]. however, the detailed mechanisms for imipramine-induced hyperglycemia are not yet clear,
and the involvement of 5-ht receptor has not been studied. in
the present study, therefore, we investigated the effects of imipramine on plasma glucose levels and the involvement of 5-ht
receptor subtypes in glycemic responses to imipramine.

materials and methods
animals
male ddy mice weighing 28 ± 32 g were obtained from slc japan
inc (japan). mice were given free access to food and water and
they were housed under a controlled 12/12 h light/dark cycle
(lights on from 7: 00 a. m. to 7: 00 p. m.) with room temperature
at 23  1 8c and humidity at 55  5 %. the experimental procedure
was approved by the kobe pharmaceutical university animal
care and use committee.

determination of plasma glucose levels
only one sample was taken from each mouse. mice were decapitated and blood was collected in tubes containing sodium fluoride. plasma glucose was measured following the method described in our previous study [6].

adrenalectomy
adrenalectomy was performed under anesthesia with pentobarbital na at 50 mg/kg. 0.5 % nacl was given to adrenalectomized
mice to maintain mineral balance. experiments were carried
out one week after the operation. after the experiments, adrenalectomized mice were dissected to confirm that the adrenal gland
had been removed.
statistics
dose-related effects on plasma glucose levels were evaluated by
one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by dunnett's
test. the effects of 5-ht receptor antagonists on imipramine-induced effects were analyzed by two-way anova followed by tukey's test.

discussion and conclusions
it has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants including imipramine elevate blood glucose levels in diabetes patients [14,17].
gupta et al. [15] demonstrated that the acute administration of
imipramine induces hyperglycemia in fasted rabbits and antagonizes insulin-induced hypoglycemia. as shown in our results,
imipramine induces hyperglycemia dose-dependently in nonfasted mice. imipramine  xxxd1891xxx  and 20 mg/kg i. p. elicited hyperglycemia which peaked 30 min after treatment. our result is consistent with previous finding obtained in different species [15].
it is recognized that the mechanism of antidepressant effects of
imipramine is closely related to inhibition of reuptake of 5-ht or

the involvement of the  xxxg1113xxx  in pharmacological effects of imipramine has been reported. imipramine is a wellknown antidepressant and reduces immobility time in the forced
swimming test, which is the screening model for assessments of
antidepressants [19 ± 21]. using the forced swimming test, redrobe and bourin [20] previously reported that non-selective 5ht2 receptor antagonist ritanserin amplified anti-immobility effects of imipramine in the forced swimming test. our previous
report [21] demonstrated that the non-selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist ly53857 enhanced the anti-immobility effects of imipramine. these results suggest that the  xxxg1113xxx  participates in pharmacological effects of imipramine. thus, the enhancing effects of ly53857 on imipramine-induced hyperglycemia are consistent with previous results obtained with forced
swimming test. these results indicate that hyperglycemia induced by imipramine is closely associated with direct effects of
imipramine on the  xxxg1113xxx .
the  xxxg1113xxx  family is divided into 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5ht2c receptor subtypes [22]. as shown in the results, the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  did not affect imipramine-induced hyperglycemia. the 5-ht2c/2b receptor antagonist sb
206 553 apparently enhanced hyperglycemia induced by imipramine. these results suggest that the selective blockade of the 5ht2c/2b receptor increases imipramine-induced hyperglycemia in
mice. in forced swimming test, anti-immobility effects of imipramine were amplified by sb 206 553 [21], which are similar to
present results. previous report demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants including imipramine have an appropriate affinity
for the  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes [18]. imipramine may act as
the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, since imipramine can inhibit 5ht-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the choroid
plexus, which is identified as a  xxxg1115xxx -mediated response [18]. we further studied effects of the 5-ht2c/2b receptor
agonist mcpp on imipramine-induced hyperglycemia. as shown
in results, mcpp significantly inhibited hyperglycemia elicited by
imipramine. however, the  xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86
did not affect  xxxd2338xxx -induced hyperglycemia. therefore, antagonistic effects of mcpp on imipramine-induced hyperglycemia are due to stimulation of the  xxxg1115xxx  but not the 5-

we previously reported that the 5-ht2c/2b receptor agonist mcpp
increases plasma glucose in rats, which is antagonized by the
non-selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist ritanserin [8]. however,
as shown in fig. 4, mcpp itself did not alter plasma glucose levels
in mice. differential involvement of the  xxxg1115xxx  agonist
in glycemia of rats and mice occurs. species difference may be
present in glycemic responses to 5-ht receptor agonists or antagonists. it has been reported that the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist
flesinoxan induces hyperglycemia in rats but did not elevate
plasma glucose levels in mice at the doses that induced hyperglycemia in rats [23, 24]. hyperglycemia induced by  xxxg1108xxx  agonists in rats is closely connected to facilitation of adrenaline release probably based on stimulation of hypothalamus
adrenal medulla branch of the sympathetic system [2, 5, 25 ±
26]. therefore, differences in adrenaline facilitation mediated
by 5-ht may be present in rats and mice. the role of the 5-ht2c
receptor in glycemia of humans is not yet clear. however, since
imipramine has been reported to elevate glucose levels in diabetes patients, effects of imipramine on plasma glucose levels in
humans may be comparable with those of mice. we demonstrated that the 5-ht1/2/5/7 receptor antagonist,  xxxd2621xxx  enhanced imipramine-induced hyperglycemia. the participation
of the 5-ht5 and 5-ht7 receptor in hyperglycemia induced by
imipramine cannot be excluded at present.
previous studies indicated that imipramine rapidly entered the
brain of mice and that brain concentration of imipramine at a
dose of 15 mg/kg i. p. was about 6 g/g 30 min after the injection
which is the maximum level [19]. as shown in results, imipramine i. c. v. 5 and 10 g induced an apparent hyperglycemia in
mice 15 and 30 min after the treatment. since the peak effects
were observed at these points, the significant hyperglycemia
may appear before 15 min after imipramine i. c. v. this suggests
that elevation of imipramine in the central nervous system is
related to hyperglycemia elicited by the peripheral injection of
imipramine. hyperglycemia induced by imipramine i. c. v. was
enhanced by the 5-ht2c/2b receptor antagonist sb 206 553, which
is in agreement with results of i. p. therefore, imipramine-induced hyperglycemia may be elicited by inhibition of the central
 xxxg1115xxx .
adrenaline plays an important role in regulation of blood glucose
levels. since imipramine elicited hyperglycemia, we studied effects of adrenalectomy on hyperglycemia. adrenalectomy
strongly inhibited hyperglycemia elicited by imipramine i. c. v.
therefore, adrenaline release from adrenal gland may be required for imipramine-elicited hyperglycemia. it has also been reported that imipramine blocks glucose transport in platelets
and erythrocytes [27, 28]. these mechanisms may be involved in
imipramine-induced hyperglycemia; further studies are needed
to clarify hyperglycemic effects of imipramine.
in summary, our results indicate that imipramine by peripheral
injection elicits hyperglycemia. the selective blockade of the 5ht2c/2b receptor increases imipramine-induced hyperglycemia
in mice. imipramine-induced hyperglycemia was reversed by

receptor antagonist, (-)-propranolol and the 5-ht3/4 receptor antagonist,  xxxd3451xxx  did not affect hyperglycemia induced imipramine. these results suggest that imipramine-induced hyperglycemia is related to the  xxxg1113xxx , but not to the 5-ht1a/1b

noradrenaline. imipramine has an affinity for the  xxxg1113xxx ,
and the direct interaction with this receptor may be related to
pharmacological effects of imipramine [18]. therefore, it is conceivable that pharmacological effects of imipramine may be
related to 5-ht receptors and that hyperglycemia induced by
imipramine may be also associated with 5-ht receptor subtypes.
in the present study, we examined the involvement of 5-ht receptor subtypes in imipramine-induced hyperglycemia in mice.
