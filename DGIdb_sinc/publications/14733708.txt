abstract
natural prostaglandins (pgs) such as  xxxg1073xxx  , pge 2 , pgf22a , and pgi2 exhibited the
highest affinity for their respective cognate receptors, but were the least selective agents
when tested in receptor binding assays.  xxxd3414xxx  acid ([1]-fluprostenol) was the most
fp-receptor-selective compound, exhibiting a high affinity (ki 5 35 6 5 nm) for the fp
receptor, and minimal affinity for dp (ki 5 52,000 nm), ep1 (ki 5 9540 nm), ep3 (ki 5
3501 nm),  xxxg1875xxx  (ki 5 41,000 nm), ip (ki . 90,000 nm), and tp (ki 5 121,000 nm) receptors.  xxxd3414xxx  acid was the most potent pg analog tested in  xxxg1878xxx  functional
phosphoinositide turnover assays in the following cell types: human ciliary muscle
(ec50 5 1.4 nm), human trabecular meshwork (ec50 5 3.6 nm), and mouse fibroblasts
and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ec50 5 2.6 nm). although  xxxd2446xxx  acid exhibited
a relatively high affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx  (ki 5 98 nm), it had significant functional
activity at fp (ec50 5 32–124 nm) and ep1 (ec50 5 119 nm) receptors.  xxxd340xxx 
acid was less selective, exhibiting a relatively high affinity for the fp (ki 5 83 nm), ep1
(ki 5 95 nm), and ep3 (ki 5 387 nm) receptors.  xxxd340xxx  acid exhibited functional
activity at the ep1 (ec50 5 2.7 nm) and fp (ec50 5 2.8–3.8 nm in most cells) receptors.
 xxxd340xxx  (nonhydrolyzed amide) also behaved as an fp agonist at the cloned human
 xxxg1878xxx  (ec50 5 681 nm), in h-tm (ec50 5 3245 nm) and other cell types. unoprostone and s-1033 bound with low affinity (ki 5 5.9 mm to . 22 mm) to the  xxxg1878xxx , were not selective, but activated the  xxxg1878xxx . in conclusion,  xxxd3414xxx  acid
has the highest affinity, the highest fp-receptor-selectivity, and the highest potency at the
 xxxg1878xxx  as compared to the other ocular hypotensive pg analogs known so far, including free acids of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone isopropyl ester.

introduction
elevated intraocular pressure (iop) is the major risk factor associated with the etiology of glaucoma,
a progressive optic neuropathy that can ultimately cause blindness (1,2). prostaglandin (pg) analogs of
501

the fp-class represent the most potent therapeutic agents in the clinical management of ocular hypertension and glaucoma today (3). the marketed pg analogs used to reduce iop include  xxxd3414xxx ® ( xxxd3414xxx ) (4–6), xalatan® ( xxxd2446xxx ) (7), rescula® (unoprostone isopropyl ester) (8), and  xxxd340xxx ® ( xxxd340xxx ) (9). despite the fact that all these pgs are ester or amide pro-drugs and are structural analogs
of  xxxd1902xxx , it has been claimed that  xxxd340xxx  (9) and unoprostone (10) mediate their biological actions
independent of the classical pg receptors. in view of the importance of this issue, we decided to determine the relative receptor affinities, receptor selectivities, and functional agonist potencies of these and
other related compounds, including some naturally occurring pgs, at the major pg receptor subtypes. we
utilized radioligand-receptor binding and second messenger assays to ascertain these parameters.

materials and methods
dp-receptor binding assay
frozen-thawed human blood platelet membranes (40–60 mg/ml stock in 25 mm tris-hcl [ph 7.4]
containing 138 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm edta) were incubated with 2–10 nm [3h]- xxxg1073xxx 
in the absence and presence of 10 mm bwa868c or 10 mm unlabeled  xxxg1073xxx  to define total and nonspecific binding, respectively, as described previously (11). the total volume of the assay mixture was
500 ml. the incubations (20 minutes at 23°c) were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration (using a whatman gf/b glass fiber filter previously soaked in 1% polyethyleneimine (pei) and 0.1% bsa), the receptor-bound radioactivity determined by scintillation spectrometry, and the data analyzed by a nonlinear, iterative, curve-fitting computer program. experiments were also performed with [3h]-bwa868c
(2–5 nm final) as the radioligand as described previously with essentially the same results as with [3h] xxxg1073xxx , except that [3h]-bwa868c yielded much greater specific binding than [3h]- xxxg1073xxx  (11).
cloned human ep1 and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor binding assays
membranes of human embryonic kidney (hek-293) cells expressing recombinant human ep1 and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors were incubated with up to 3 nm [3h]-pge 2 in 10 mm 2-[n-morpholino] ethanesulfonic
acid buffer containing 1 mm edta and 10 mm mncl2 (ph 6) for 90 minutes at 23°c in the presence
of the test agents or buffer. nonspecific binding was defined with 10 mm unlabeled pge2 (12,13). the
incubations were terminated as described above and the data analyzed, also as described above.

 xxxg1874xxx  binding assay
the bovine corpus luteum expresses high-affinity [3 h]-pge 2 binding sites that exhibit  xxxg1874xxx  subtype pharmacology (14). washed total particulate bovine corpus luteum membranes (20–60
mg/ml) were prepared by standard homogenization and centrifugation procedures and incubated with
[3 h]-pge 2 (0.9–2 nm) in krebs buffer (ph 7.4) for 1 hour at 23°c in a total volume of 500 ml as
described previously (14). nonspecific binding was defined with 1 mm unlabeled pge2 . the assays
were terminated by vacuum filtration (using a whatman gf/b glass fiber filter previously soaked in
0.3% pei) and the data analyzed as described above for dp assays.

fp-receptor binding assay
the bovine corpus luteum expresses high-affinity [3h]pgf 2a binding sites that reflect pharmacological characteristics of fp receptors (14). washed total particulate bovine corpus luteum mem502

branes (20 mg/ml final) were incubated with [3 h]-pgf 2a (0.9–1.5 nm) in krebs buffer (ph 7.4) for
2 hours at 23°c in a total volume of 500 ml as described previously (14). nonspecific binding was
defined with 1–10 mm unlabeled  xxxd1902xxx  or  xxxd1729xxx . the assays were terminated by vacuum filtration (using a whatman gf/b glass fiber filter previously soaked in 0.3% pei) and the data analyzed as described above for dp assays.

ip- and tp-receptor binding assays
human platelets express specific ip and tp prostanoid receptor binding sites (15). frozen-thawed
expired human platelet membranes (40 mg/ml) dispersed in 50 mm tris-hcl containing 10 mm
 xxxd2534xxx  (ph 7.4) were incubated with 1 nm [3h]-sq29548 or 3 nm [3h]- xxxd2331xxx  to label tp and ip
receptors, respectively, as described previously (15,16). nonspecific binding was defined with 10 mm
pinane thromboxane or 10 mm  xxxd2331xxx  for tp and ip receptors, respectively. the incubations (60
minutes at 23°c) were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration (using a whatman gf/b glass fiber filter previously soaked in 0.3% pei) and the data were analyzed as described above for dp assays.

fp- and tp-receptor phosphoinositide turnover assays
[3 h]-inositol phosphates ([ 3 h]-ips) produced via agonist-mediated activation of phospholipase
c were quantified via previously published procedures (14,16,17). in brief, confluent swiss 3t3 fibroblasts, rat vascular smooth-muscle cells (a7r5), hek-293 expressing the cloned human ciliary
body  xxxg1878xxx , human ciliary muscle (h-cm), and human trabecular meshwork (h-tm) cells (all
containing functional fp receptors), and immortalized human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells
(npe) (16) containing tp receptors were exposed to 2–3 mci of [3 h]-myo-inositol in 0.5 ml dmem
for about 24 hours at 37°c. after labeling of the cell membrane phospholipids, the cells were rinsed
once with dmem/f-12 containing 10 mm licl, and the agonist stimulation experiment was performed in 0.5 ml of the same medium to facilitate accumulation of [ 3 h]-ips. cells were exposed
to the agonist or vehicle buffer for 60 minutes at 37°c, followed by aspiration of the medium and
immediate addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx . the cell lysates (0.9 ml) were loaded
on columns containing 1 ml ag 1-x8 anion exchange resin in the formate form. unincorporated
[3 h]-myo-inositol was removed by washing with 10 ml of distilled water and discarded. the total [3 h]-ips were collected into scintillation vials by washing the columns with 8 ml of 50 mm
ammonium formate and 4 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate made in 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx . the radioactivity associated with the total [3 h]-ips was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy
on a beta-counter.

dp-,  xxxg1873xxx  -,  xxxg1875xxx  - and ip-receptor induced camp production
stimulation of camp production via these receptors was studied in embryonic bovine tracheal
fibroblasts (ebtr) (18), immortalized nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells (npe) (19), chinese hamster ovary cells (cho) (20), and national cancer bank-20 (ncb-20) cells (21), respectively. cultured cells in 24-well plates were exposed to the compounds of interest in culture media containing
0.8 mm ascorbate and 1.0 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor,  xxxd2388xxx , at
23°c for 15 minutes to permit accumulation of camp. after aspiration of the reaction medium, icecold 0.1 m acetic acid (150 ml, ph 3.5) was added for the termination of camp production and cell
lysis. finally, the samples were neutralized with ice-cold 0.1 m sodium acetate (225 ml, ph
11.5–12.0). the camp produced was quantified using an enzyme immunoassay as described previously (18–21).

data analyses
original data (dpm) from the different ligand binding experiments were analyzed using a nonlinear, iterative curve-fitting computer program as described previously (14–16). the inhibition constants (kis) were calculated from ic50 values as described previously (14–16,22). the pi turnover and
camp production functional data were analyzed by the sigmoidal fit function of the origin scientific
graphics software (microcal software, northampton, ma) to determine agonist potency (ec50) values (14–21).

results
receptor binding studies
a survey of the receptor-binding affinities of some key natural pgs revealed that in general each
possessed the highest affinity for their respective preferred receptor; that is,  xxxg1073xxx  for dp receptor,
pgi2 for  xxxg1879xxx , et cetera (table 1). however, it was evident that none of the natural pgs were
selective because they exhibited significant affinity for several other pg receptors. for example, pge2
interacted with ep1 (ki 5 26 nm), ep3 (ki 5 3 nm), and  xxxg1875xxx  (ki 5 0.9 nm) receptors with nanomolar affinity, and  xxxd1902xxx  cross-reacted with ep3 receptors (ki 5 24 nm) in addition to fp (ki 5 130
nm) receptors (table 1).
the synthetic pg analogs were, in general, more selective than the natural pgs (tables 1 and
2). however, the degree of relative selectivity for the  xxxg1878xxx  among the pg analogs studied varied significantly (table 2).  xxxd3414xxx  acid ([1]-fluprostenol) was the most fp-receptor-selective
compound, exhibiting a high affinity (ki 5 35 6 5 nm) for the  xxxg1878xxx  and minimal affinity for
dp (ki 5 52 6 7.2 mm), ep1 (ki 5 9.5 6 1.2 mm), ep3 (ki 5 3.5 6 0.4 mm),  xxxg1875xxx  (ki 5 41 6 2.6
mm), ip (ki . 90 mm), and tp (ki 5 121 mm) receptors (table 2). fluprostenol (racemic) was an
fp-receptor selective agent but less so than the (1)-fluprostenol enantiomer ( xxxd3414xxx  acid) (table
2).  xxxd340xxx  acid was less selective, exhibiting a relatively high affinity for three different pg receptors, (i.e., fp [ki 5 83 nm], ep1 [ki 5 95 nm], and ep3 [ki 5 387 nm]). although  xxxd2446xxx

acid exhibited a relatively high affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx  (ki 5 98 nm), it also displayed high affinity for the pg uptake site (ki 5 149 nm) (see table 3 legend). the prodrug,  xxxd340xxx , had the
highest affinity for fp receptors among the pg receptor subtypes, but was not selective because it
also had affinity for other pg receptors (table 2). a similar profile of affinity for unoprostone,
s-1033, and  xxxd340xxx  existed for the different pg receptors (table 2).

functional signal transduction studies
in functional second messenger assays,  xxxd3414xxx  acid was the most potent pg analog tested in the
phosphoinositide turnover assays in the following cell types expressing native or cloned fp receptors: at
cloned human  xxxg1878xxx  expressed in hek-293 cells (ec50 5 2.4 6 0.3 nm), and in
h-cm (ec50 5 1.4 6 0.2 nm), h-tm (ec50 5 3.6 6 1.3 nm), mouse fibroblasts and rat aortic smooth
muscle (ec50 5 2.6 6 0.5 nm) cells (table 3).  xxxd3414xxx  acid did not have any significant functional
activity at the other pg receptors studied (dp,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3,  xxxg1875xxx , ip, and tp; table 4).  xxxd2446xxx  acid exhibited varying levels of functional activity at fp (ec50 5 32–124 nm) and ep1 (ec50 5 119 nm) receptors. similarly,  xxxd340xxx  acid also exhibited functional activity at the ep1 (ec50 5 2.7 nm) and fp
(ec50 5 2.8–3.8 nm in most cell types except h-tm) receptors in different cell types (tables 3 and 4).
 xxxd340xxx  (amide) had a relatively low affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx  compared to other fp-class pgs,
but behaved as an fp agonist at the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  (ec50 5 681 nm), in h-tm
(ec50 5 3245 nm) and other cell types (tables 2 and 3). unoprostone and s-1033 bound with relatively
low affinity to the  xxxg1878xxx  and were not as selective (table 2). both of the latter compounds were
 xxxg1878xxx  agonists with lower potencies than other pg analogs discussed above (table 3).
as expected, the pro-drugs,  xxxd340xxx  (amide), unoprostone isopropyl ester,  xxxd2446xxx  (isopropyl ester), and  xxxd3414xxx  (isopropyl ester), displayed a lower fp-receptor functional activity than
their respective free acid hydrolytic products in a number of different cell types derived from different species (mouse, rat, and human) (table 3). however, the observation that  xxxd340xxx  (amide)
behaved as an fp agonist in all of the five cell types studied was significant (table 3). this was further substantiated by the antagonism studies described. thus, the fp-nature of the activity of  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx  acid,  xxxd340xxx  acid,  xxxd2446xxx , unoprostone, and (6)-fluprostenol in cells
expressing natural or recombinant fp receptors was confirmed by the blockade of the pi turnover induced by these agonists by the fp-receptor-selective antagonist, al-8810 (ki 5 0.2–5.7 mm; see
table 3 legend).
the relative agonist potency of the various pg analogs was also ascertained in other pg receptor functional assays. as shown in table 4, the natural pgs exhibited agonist activity at multiple receptors, albeit weak activity at times. for instance, pgi2 was active at ip and ep1 receptors, and pge2
activated ep1 ,  xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx , and ip receptors (table 4). similarly, of the synthetic pg analogs,  xxxd1729xxx  was a potent agonist at ep1 and ep3 receptors, and  xxxd2446xxx  acid and  xxxd340xxx  acid
were active at ep1 receptors as discussed above. in contrast,  xxxd3414xxx  acid did not exhibit any appreciable activity at any pg receptors other than fp receptors (tables 3 and 4). the fp agonist activity of the various pg analogs and the antagonist effects of al-8810 were well correlated (p ,
0.0001) in the different cell types derived from various species: h-cm versus h-tm, r 5 0.97; h-cm
versus cloned human ocular  xxxg1878xxx , r 5 0.96; h-cm versus mouse 3t3 cells, r 5 0.93; h-cm
versus rat a7r5 cells, r 5 0.96; h-tm versus cloned  xxxg1878xxx , r 5 0.95; h-tm versus mouse 3t3
cells, r 5 0.91; and h-tm versus rat a7r5 cells, r 5 0.93.

discussion
the current studies have demonstrated the relative ligand binding affinities and functional agonist potencies of numerous natural pgs and synthetic iop-lowering pg analogs. these studies are the

first to compare and contrast such pharmacological properties of these compounds. the overall conclusion is that the natural pgs do not show any significant level of selectivity for any given pg receptor subtype. however, the synthetic pgs possess greater fp selectivity than the natural pgs, but
some are more receptor-subtype-selective than others.
from the ligand binding and functional data obtained from the current studies, and some extracted from the literature, it is evident that the most potent and fp-receptor-selective pg agonist is

 xxxd3414xxx  acid. it has nanomolar affinity and potency at the  xxxg1878xxx  with minimal affinity and
activity at other major pg receptor subtypes.  xxxd3414xxx  acid potently stimulated pi turnover via the
cloned human  xxxg1878xxx , and via the endogenously expressed fp receptors in h-cm, h-tm, rat
smooth muscle, and mouse fibroblasts with very similar potencies (ec50 5 1.4–3.6 nm). in contrast,
 xxxd340xxx  acid (17-phenyl-trinor- xxxd1902xxx  ), while having a relatively high affinity and activity at the
 xxxg1878xxx , also avidly interacts with and activates human ep1 (23) and ep3 receptors (14). similarly,  xxxd2446xxx  acid bound to and activated the human  xxxg1872xxx  (23) in addition to the fpreceptor. the propensity for  xxxd340xxx  to cause ocular itching (24), ocular pain (24,25), hyperemia
(26), and general discomfort shortly after topical ocular dosing may be related to its hydrolysis to the
free acid that activates ep1 and ep3 receptors, and perhaps other receptors too. such adverse effects
of  xxxd340xxx  acid may be mediated by cytokines released by activation of ep1/ep3 receptors (27).
the hydrolytic breakdown of  xxxd340xxx  to its free acid in corneal and other tissues has been ob509

served following topical ocular dosing in cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits (28), and in vitro using
human and rabbit (29,30), and human and bovine (31) ocular tissues. due to the relatively high affinity and potency of  xxxd340xxx  acid at the human ep1 and ep3 receptors (23), even a small amount
of hydrolysis of the parent pro-drug would be sufficient to evoke the ocular surface side-effects mentioned above.
two recent publications have claimed that  xxxd340xxx  (9) and unoprostone (10) produce their
biological effects independent of any conventional pg receptors. our present findings, coupled with
other recent data (32–36), have demonstrated clearly that both these compounds have direct fp-receptor agonist activity, observations that have been replicated in five different cell types (including
three different species) expressing recombinant or endogenous fp receptors (table 3). furthermore,
the fp-receptor activity of  xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone was antagonized by the fp-receptor antagonist al-8810, using pi turnover assays (present studies) and intracellular ca21 mobilization studies
(32,34,35,36). the latter intracellular ca21 mobilization studies revealed that  xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone, along with  xxxd3414xxx  acid and  xxxd2446xxx  acid, directly activated fp receptors in several
cell types within 3–5 seconds (32,33,36), thus virtually eliminating the possibility that such  xxxg1878xxx  activation might be attributable to hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  to its free acid by these cells in
vitro. recent intracellular ca21 mobilization studies in h-cm cells have demonstrated fp-receptor
antagonist-sensitive responses to  xxxd340xxx  beginning at 30 nm (unpublished observations), this being similar to previous data obtained for the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  (36).
it is noteworthy that the rank order of potency of the various pg analogs and their relative potencies among the five different cell types used in the current study is well correlated (r 5 0.91–0.97;
p , 0.0001). this was not unexpected, however, because the  xxxg1878xxx  is highly homologous among
the three different species studied and is coupled to the same signal transduction pathways involving
pi turnover and intracellular ca21 mobilization (37,38). the ec50 values reported for some pg analogs
in the cat iris contraction assays ( xxxd2446xxx  acid ec50 5 16 nm; s-1033 ec50 5 360 nm) ref. (39)
were slightly lower than those obtained from our cell-based pi turnover assays. however, such differences in agonist potencies in assays involving different cell types and tissues may be explained by
differences in receptor density and/or differences in receptor-effector coupling, and amplification of
the signaling mechanisms in these different systems (40–42). the pro-drug  xxxd340xxx  has been
claimed to exert its actions via nonprostaglandin receptors but via pharmacologically uncharacterized
and nonvalidated “ xxxd340xxx  receptors” (43). however, this claim is currently flawed in light of the
fact that  xxxd340xxx  competes effectively for binding to the  xxxg1878xxx  radiolabeled with [3 h]pgf 2a
(ref. 33; this study), [3 h] xxxd3414xxx  acid (36) and for [3h]-17-phenyl- xxxd1902xxx  (43), all well-known potent fp agonists, with ki values of 6.3 mm, 9.2 mm, and 254 nm, respectively. these affinity parameters appear physiologically relevant because  xxxd340xxx  concentration achieved in the ciliary bodies following topical ocular dosing of monkey eyes was 2.64 mm (43). similarly,  xxxd340xxx  also
directly activates the  xxxg1878xxx  with half maximal effects (ec50) being observed between 0.68 mm and 12.1 mm in five different cell types using pi turnover assays (this study), responses that can be antagonized by al-8810, an  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist.  xxxd340xxx  also directly
stimulated fp receptors to mobilize intracellular ca21 within seconds of addition to three different
cell types (human, rat, mouse) expressing fp receptors with ec50 values of 1.47 mm to 3.9 mm, these
values again being close to the in vivo concentration achieved after topical ocular dosing of monkeys
(43). these fp-receptor-mediated intracellular ca21 mobilization activities of  xxxd340xxx  are also
blocked by the fp antagonist (32,33,36). furthermore,  xxxd340xxx  also exhibited physiologically relevant activity at the cat  xxxg1878xxx  by stimulating pi turnover with an apparent ec50 value # 1 mm
(43). therefore,  xxxd340xxx  has direct agonist activity at the  xxxg1878xxx  in numerous cell types derived from several different species, including humans.
in a related issue, it has been claimed that  xxxd340xxx  is not subject to hydrolysis in vitro or in
vivo (9,43), although this may be a reflection of the low sensitivity (detection limit of 25 nm) of the
hplc assay system used by these authors (9). once again, this claim is contradicted by numerous
studies where significant hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  to  xxxd340xxx  acid has been demonstrated in vitro
510

using human and rabbit (29,30), bovine (31,44), and human and porcine (45) ocular tissues, and also
in vivo following topical ocular dosing of monkeys and rabbits (28).  xxxd340xxx  acid (,30 nm) was
generated from  xxxd340xxx  hydrolysis in vitro (45), and up to 106 nm  xxxd340xxx  acid was found
in the aqueous humor and ciliary bodies after topical ocular dosing with  xxxd340xxx  of rabbit and
monkey eyes (28). because  xxxd340xxx  acid (17-phenyl  xxxd1902xxx  ) is a very potent  xxxg1878xxx  agonist
(e.g., cat iris contraction ec50 5 0.7 nm, [ref. 46]; h-cm  xxxg1878xxx  ec50 5 3.8 nm, table 3), even
a small amount of hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  would generate sufficient  xxxd340xxx  acid to fully occupy and activate fp receptors in such tissues as ciliary muscles to induce its reported iop-lowering
activity (9,43). therefore, in the absence of appropriate and detailed pharmacological and/or cloning
data to unequivocally demonstrate the existence of the so-called “ xxxd340xxx  receptor” (9,43), the latter remains an enigma, and thus all of the actions of  xxxd340xxx  in vivo can be attributed to its potent hydrolytic product,  xxxd340xxx  acid.
in conclusion, the present and other recent studies have demonstrated that while  xxxd3414xxx  acid
exhibits a high affinity, high fp-selectivity, and high functional potency at the  xxxg1878xxx  of many
species,  xxxd340xxx  acid has a high affinity for, and agonist activity, at ep1 and ep3 receptors (in
addition to its  xxxg1878xxx  activity).  xxxd340xxx  acid’s activity at ep1 and ep3 receptors may contribute to the reported ocular side-effects, such as ocular itching and ocular pain, associated with  xxxd340xxx  (24–27). in addition, direct fp-receptor agonist activity of  xxxd340xxx  has been demonstrated in five different cell types (table 3), thus corroborating earlier observations using different
assay procedures (32–36).

note added in proof
a recent clinical study of 31 patients dosed via topical ocular route of administration once daily
with  xxxd340xxx  revealed the presence of 22.0 6 6.3 nm of  xxxd340xxx  free acid in the aqueous humor of the dosed eyes 2 hours post dose (47). the identity of  xxxd340xxx  acid in the aqueous humor
was confirmed by hplc and mass spectrometry. this study demonstrated the active hydrolysis of
 xxxd340xxx  to its free acid by human eyes in vivo thus confirming the many in vitro studies using
ocular tissues of many species (29–31,44) and the data from in vivo studies in the monkey (28). due
to the high potency of  xxxd340xxx  acid at the  xxxg1878xxx  (ec50 5 0.7 nm in cat iris;
ec50 in h-cm cells 5 3.8 nm), such a high concentration in the aqueous humor of  xxxd340xxx  acid
would be expected to activate the fp receptors in the anterior segment and thus account for the ioplowering associated with  xxxd340xxx . hence,  xxxd340xxx  is a pro-drug.
