improvement by the insulin-sensitizing agent, troglitazone, of abnormal
fibrinolysis in type 2 diabetes mellitus
ken kato, daishiro yamada, sanae midorikawa, wakano sato, and tsuyoshi watanabe
this study evaluated abnormal fibrinolysis in diabetic patients in terms of the pathophysiological significance and reversibility
by oral hypoglycemic agents. forty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly treated for 4 weeks with
 xxxd2215xxx  {n = 23) or troglitazone (n = 24). before and after treatment, glycemic control, steady-state plasma glucose and
insulin (sspg and sspi, respectively), and markers of fibrinolysis (tissue plasminogen activator [tpa] and plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 [pal-l]) were analyzed in each patient. pretreatment plasma pal-1 in diabetic patients, but not tpa, was
well correlated with the severity of retinopathy assessed by the fluorescence technique. four weeks of treatment with
troglitazone significantly decreased hemoglobin alc (hbalc), sspg, and pal-1 without an alteration of tpa. the troglitazoneinduced decrease in plasma pal-1 (50.3 v28.8 i~mol/l; p < .05) was correlated with hbalc (8.80% v7.21%, r = .539, p < .01) and
sspg (16.2 v 8.97 mmol/l, r = .562, p < .01) but not with sspi. in contrast, treatment with  xxxd2215xxx  for 4 weeks also
reduced the hbalc titer to almost the same extent as troglitazone (1.38% v 1.59%), but did not change the plasma pal-1 or
sspg titer. these results suggest that an abnormal fibrinolytic state, especially overproduction of pal-l, may be a pathogenic
factor in the development of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, which may be improved by correction of the insulin
resistance with troglitazone.

a s c u l a r complications are a common factor
determining morbidity and mortality in the diabetic
population. the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia induces
macroangiopathy and microangiopathy in diabetic patients are
poorly understood, although some metabolic changes induced
by hyperglycemia are proposed to mediate this process. ~-s the
fibrinolytic system may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and other diabetic vascular complications. 4,5 two of the main determinants of fibrinolytic activity in
the circulation are tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) and its
inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (pai- 1), with pai- 1
considered to be more critical for total fibrinolytic activity
compared with tpa. 6 several studies have suggested that plasma
pai-1 is elevated in diabetic patients, possibly associated with
insulin resistance. 7,s however, the precise interaction between
insulin resistance and plasma pai-1 in the diabetic population
has not been clarified.
troglitazone, a newly developed thiazolidinedione derivative, has been shown to decrease plasma glucose by enhancing
insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. 94° thus, this
agent may be a useful tool to clarify the role of insulin resistance
in the fibrinolytic abnormality in diabetic patients. the present
study examines the action of troglitazone on abnormal fibrinolysis in comparison to  xxxd2215xxx , a sulfonylurea, to elucidate
(1) the interrelationship between insulin resistance and abnormal fibrinolysis and (2) the clinical relevance of the treatment of
insulin resistance for the correction of abnormal fibrinolysis in
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

subjects and methods
patients
forty-seven randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(22 men and 25 women) admitted for glycemic control to the third
department of internal medicine, fukushima medical university, were
enrolled in this study. thirty healthy, nondiabetic individuals (13 men
and 17 women) aged 48 to 67 years (mean, 52) were used as control
subjects to evaluate basal plasma pai-1 and tpa levels. all patients were
free of liver dysfunction, hematologic diseases, thyroid dysfunction,
hypertension, and infectious disease and were placed on an optimumcalorie dietary regimen (25 kcal/standardized body weight per day)
containing 150 mmol sodium per day for at least 2 weeks before the
study.
the study protocol was approved by the committee for human
research of fukushima medical university, and all subjects provided
informed consent to participate. the study was performed in accordance
with the declaration of helsinki and its revisions.

protocols
our preliminary study indicated that 400 mg/d troglitazone and 2.5
mg/d  xxxd2215xxx  possess almost equal potency in terms of hypoglycemic action in type 2 diabetic patients. the chemical structure of the
agents is shown in fig 1. thus, we performed a randomized group study
in which 200 mg troglitazone twice dally orally after breakfast and
dinner or 2.5 mg  xxxd2215xxx  once daily orally before breakfast were
prescribed for 24 and 23 patients, respectively, for 4 weeks. subjects
were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups according to the
randomization code. there were no significant differences between
troglitazone and  xxxd2215xxx  groups in age, sex, body mass index
(bmi), waist to hip ratio, serum triglyceride (tg), total cholesterol
(tc), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), diabetic complications, and duration of diabetes (table 1). the severity of diabetic
retinopathy was classified by 3 grades according to the conventional
classification using a fluorescent technique: no retinopathy, simple
retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy. the stage of diabetic nephropathy was assessed by the grade of mlcroalbumlnnria (20 to 200 ~g/min
for urinary albumin excretion rate or 30 to 300 mg/d for urinary albumin
excretion) and/or overt and consistent proteinuria (>0.3 g/d for total
protein).

samples were obtained from the cubital vein in the  xxxd2476xxx  an
overnight fast for the determination of hemoglobin ai~ (hbai~), tg,
tc, hdl-c, tpa, and pai-1 in serum samples. blood for the
determination of tpa and pai-1 was citrated, immediately cooled in
icewater, and then centrifuged at 3,000?< g at 4°c for 15 minutes, and
the resultant plasma was stored at - 2 0 ° c until tpa and pai-1
determinations. under the conditions we used, the measurement of the
two variables was stable for at least 3 months after sample collection.
plasma glucose was assayed enzymatically using an autoanalyzer
(glucose auto and stat, ga-1122). hbai~ was determined using an
autoanalyzer (hlc-723ghb) coupled with high-performance liquid
chromatography. serum  xxxg941xxx  (alt), aspartate
aminotransferase (ast), tg, and tc were determined enzymatically
using an autoanalyzer (cobas fara; baxter, chicago, il). the hdl-c
level was measured using commercially available kits (hdl-l-2
daiichi) and an autoanalyzer (cobas fara). plasma pai-1 and tpa
antigen levels were measured by specific and sensitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay methods using kits from biopool, umeft, sweden
(tintelize and imulyse-5).
insulin sensitivity was estimated in all diabetic patients by the
steady-state plasma glucose (sspg) method using octreotide, a somatostatin analog (novartis pharma, basel, switzerland) as originally
described by harano et al. h briefly, intravenous catheters were placed
in both arms after the subjects fasted overnight. blood was sampled
from one arm for determination of plasma glucose and insulin every 30
minutes until 120 minutes from the start of the examination, and the

so=nhconh
'~

contralateral arm was used for administration of the test substance;
octreotide in a solution containing 0.5% human  xxxg124xxx  was
administered at 30 pg/h to suppress endogenous insulin secretion.
simultaneously, insulin and glucose were infused at 50 mu/kg/h and 6
mg/kg/min, respectively. plasma glucose and insulin reached plateau
levels in 90 and 30 minutes, respectively. we defined the plasma
glucose and insulin value at 120 minutes of infusion as the sspg and
steady-state plasma insulin (sspi), respectively. under these conditions, sspg was shown to be inversely correlated with insulin
sensitivity as previously reported. 11

results
plasma pai-1 was significantlyincreased in all of the diabetic
patients compared with the nondiabetic control subjects and
increased significantlyin correlation with the grade of retinopathy in the diabetic patient (fig 2a). however, plasma tpa was
not well correlated with- the grade of retinopathy in diabetic
patients, although it was significantlyhigher in diabetic patients
with retinopathy versus the control subjects and diabetic
patients without retinopathy (fig 2b). hbalc, pal-i, tpa,
sspg, sspi, alt, and ast levels before treatment were not
significantlydifferent between the two treatment groups. after 4
weeks of treatment with  xxxd2215xxx , good glycemic control
was achieved in all of the patients as judged from the decrease
in the hbalc level. in patients treated with troglitazone for 4
weeks, glycemic control remained poor in 4 patients
(hba1c > 8%), improved in 15 (hbalc < 8% but >6.5%), and
was very good in 5 (hbaio =< 6.5%). the reduction of the
hbamc level in patients after treatment with troglitazone

(1.59% + 0.16%) was essentially equal to that obtained after
treatment with  xxxd2215xxx  (1.38% + 0.10%). a significant
reduction in the plasma pai-1 level was found only in the
troglitazone group. in contrast, no significant differences in
plasma tpa and sspi were observed before and after treatment
in any of the patient groups. an improvement of the hbato level
and of sspg was well correlated in the troglitazone group
(r = .539, p < .01), but not in the  xxxd2215xxx  group (fig 3).
in addition, a positive correlation was observed between the
changes in sspg and in pai-1 (r--.562, p < .01) in the
troglitazone group. however, in the  xxxd2215xxx  group, the
decrease in sspg was only 14% and was not correlated with the
decrease in plasma pai-1 (fig 4). no significant changes in tg,
tc, hdl-c (data not shown), alt, and ast (table 2) were
observed before and after treatment with the medications.

discussion
we first confirmed that the plasma concentration of pai-1,
but not tpa, is well correlated with the severity of retinopathy in
japanese type 2 diabetic patients. 12 thus, it is suggested that

pai- 1, but not tpa, may have a pathogenic potential for diabetic
microangiopathy as previously suggested.13,14
next, we demonstrated that glycemic control with troglitazone, but not  xxxd2215xxx , resulted in a significant decrease of
sspg and plasma pai-1 without changes in the plasma
lipoprotein profile and liver function. an early report that
treatment of nondiabetic obese patients with metformin decreased the plasma pai-1 level 15 supports the presence of a
biological interrelationship between an increase in the pai-1
level and insulin resistance. our results clearly show that the
decrease of plasma pai-1 in diabetic patients treated with

troglitazone was correlated with a decrease in the sspg level,
although the exact mechanism underlying this relationship
remains to he explored. in diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance
is associated with a high concentration of plasma insulin and its
precursors ( xxxg1193xxx  and split  xxxg1193xxx ). insulin 8,16 and
 xxxg1193xxx  1.7 were reported to enhance pai-1 release from
endothelial cells or hepatocytes in parallel with increased
expression of pai-1 mrna. thus, it may be possible that
hyperinsulinemia enhanced pai-1 expression in our patients.
however, our data clearly show that sspi was not changed, in
contrast to plasma pal-1, by treatment with either troglitazone
or glibenclarnide. in contrast, endothelial dysfunction in relation to insulin resistance seems to play a pathogenic role,
instead of hyperinsulinemia, in the elevation of plasma pai-1 in
our diabetic patients, as we recently reported that troglitazone
improves endothelial cell function such as the overexpression of
 xxxg674xxx  and pai-1 in human umbilical endothelial cells in
culture.is,19
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that the improvement
of insulin resistance with troglitazone decreases the plasma
pal1 level, which may be beneficial for the prevention of
diabetic vascular complications.
