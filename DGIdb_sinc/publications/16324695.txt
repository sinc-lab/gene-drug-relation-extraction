abstract
preincubation (30 min) of bovine tracheal smooth muscle with various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 mum) of  xxxd2098xxx  decreased isoprenalineinduced maximal relaxation (emax) of  xxxd2586xxx -contracted preparations in a concentration dependent fashion, indicating desensitization of
the  xxxg92xxx . preincubation with 1 mum of the protein kinase c (pkc) activator  xxxd2925xxx  (pma) caused a small but
significant decrease in  xxxd2398xxx -induced emax, indicating activated pkc-mediated heterologous  xxxg92xxx  desensitization. to
investigate the capacity of activated pkc to regulate homologous desensitization, we incubated the smooth muscle strips with the combination of
both 1 mum pma and 1 mum  xxxd2098xxx . this combined treatment synergistically decreased the  xxxd2398xxx -induced maximal relaxation, as
compared to the individual effects of pma and  xxxd2098xxx  alone, indicating a common pathway for heterologous and homologous desensitization.
moreover, the specific pkc-inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-3-(1h-indol-3-yl) maleimide ( xxxd2195xxx ) markedly
increased the potency and emax of  xxxd2398xxx  for all conditions used, including control conditions, and the synergistic effects of pma and
 xxxd2098xxx  were completely prevented. in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that homologous desensitization of the beta2-adrenergic
receptor can be enhanced by pkc activation. for the first time we have provided evidence that this concept is functionally operative in airway
smooth muscle, and it may explain the reduced bronchodilator response to  xxxg92xxx  agonists in patients with asthma during a severe
exacerbation.

1. introduction
inhaled  xxxg92xxx  agonists are by far the most effective bronchodilators used for the relief of symptoms in patients
with asthma (hall, 2004). however, it has been shown that
chronic beta-agonist therapy can diminish the efficacy of these
drugs (beasley et al., 1999; sears et al., 1990) and it is well
known that patients with asthma have a reduced bronchodilator
response to beta-agonists during a severe exacerbation (hancox et
al., 1999; torphy, 1988). possible mechanisms, which could
account for these effects, are the development of homologous
and/or heterologous desensitization of the  xxxg92xxx .

protein kinase c (pkc) have been described in modulating
the function of the  xxxg92xxx .
homologous desensitization of the  xxxg92xxx  is characterized by a rapid loss in agonist-stimulated camp generation, primarily mediated by grks, which recognise the
agonist-occupied form of the receptor, and involves phosphorylation of the receptor. such phosphorylation results in the
binding of beta-arrestin which prevents coupling of the receptor
to its stimulatory g protein (gs), subsequently followed by
sequestration and/or downregulation of the receptor (krupnick
and benovic, 1998; penn et al., 1998).
heterologous desensitization is initiated by second messenger dependent kinases such as pka and pkc. cyclic ampactivated pka can phosphorylate the  xxxg92xxx , thereby
causing uncoupling of the receptor from its gs protein, which
results in a diminished adenylyl cyclase response (penn et al.,
1998). agents which activate pkc, such as muscarinic agonists

152

and phorbol esters, have also been shown to attenuate
responses to beta-agonists (grandordy et al., 1994), presumably
by phosphorylation of the  xxxg92xxx  and subsequent
uncoupling from gs (pitcher et al., 1992). recently, we have
presented direct functional evidence for the involvement of
pkc in the cross-talk between the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx 
and  xxxg92xxx  in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (boterman et al., 2005) and rat oesophagus smooth muscle (oostendorp et al., 2004). heterologous desensitization does not
promote beta-arrestin binding to the receptor and subsequent
rapid internalization (bohm et al., 1997; shore and moore,
2003).
interestingly, heterologous and homologous desensitization
are not necessarily completely independent processes. thus, it
has been shown that pkc can mediate changes in the cellular
expression and activity of grks (de blasi et al., 1995). pkcmediated phosphorylation not only upregulates the activity of
 xxxg970xxx  (chuang et al., 1995) but also targets this kinase to the
plasma membrane (winstel et al., 1996). in addition, it has been
suggested that pka can induce beta- xxxg2010xxx  expression (iacovelli et al., 1996; parruti et al., 1993) and pka-mediated phosphorylation has been also shown to promote the translocation
of  xxxg970xxx  to the plasma membrane (cong et al., 2001). little is
known, however, about the functional consequences of these
interactions. in this study, we present direct evidence for the
capacity of pkc to regulate homologous  xxxg92xxx 
desensitization in bovine tracheal smooth muscle, using the
specific pkc activator  xxxd2925xxx  (pma)
and a specific nonselective pkc inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-3-(1h-indol-3-yl) maleimide (gf
109203x) (toullec et al., 1991).  xxxd2195xxx  inhibits all
conventional (alpha,  xxxg836xxx  and beta2) and novel (delta, epsilon and theta) pkc
isozymes present in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (webb et
al., 1997), and is 200-fold more selective in inhibiting pkc
compared to pka (toullec et al., 1991).
2. materials and methods
2.1. reagents
dulbecco's modification of eagle's medium (dmem), foetal bovine serum, nahco3 solution (7.5%), penicillin / streptomycin solution (5000 u/ml : 5000 mug/ml) and hepes solution
(1 m) were obtained from gibco brl life technologies
(paisley, u.k.).  xxxd2586xxx  chloride, (−)- xxxd2398xxx  hydrochloride and pma ( xxxd2925xxx ) were
obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.),
 xxxd2195xxx  (2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]3-(1h-indol-3-yl) maleimide) was purchased from boehringer
(mannheim, germany) and  xxxd2098xxx  hydrobromide was a
generous gift from boehringer-ingelheim (ingelheim, germany) all other chemicals were of analytical grade.
2.2. tissue preparation
fresh bovine tracheas were obtained from the slaughterhouse and were transported to the laboratory within 30 min at

room temperature in krebs–henseleit (kh) buffer of the following composition (nm): nacl 177.5, kcl 5.6,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2,
cacl2 2.5, nah2po4 1.3, nahco3 25.0, glucose 5.5, pregassed with 95% o2 and 5% co2; ph 7.4. the tracheal smooth
muscle was dissected carefully and smooth muscle strips
(12 × 3 mm) were prepared free of mucosa and serosal connective tissue in kh buffer gassed with 95% o2 / 5% co2 at room
temperature. subsequently, all strips were maintained overnight in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) supplemented with 10 mm nahco3, 20 mm hepes, 100 u/ml
penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum at
37 °c (55 rpm).
2.3. experimental procedure
after washing in several volumes of kh-buffer, gassed with
95% o2 and 5% co2, ph 7.4 at 37 °c, the bovine tracheal
smooth muscle strips were mounted in 20 ml organ baths
containing gassed kh-buffer (37 °c) for isotonic recording,
using a preload of 500 mg. after a 60 min equilibration period
the strips were precontracted twice with cumulatively administered  xxxd2586xxx  (0.1, 1, 10 and 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mum, respectively) with a 60 min washing period in between. after
washing, basal tone was established with  xxxd2398xxx  (0.1
mum), immediately followed by a 30 min washing period.
after preincubation for 45 min in the absence or presence of
10 mum  xxxd2195xxx , smooth muscle strips were incubated with
kh-buffer (35 min), 1 mum pma (35 min), 0.1, 1 or 10 mum
 xxxd2098xxx  (30 min), or 1 mum pma (35 min) plus 1 mum  xxxd2098xxx 
(30 min), immediately followed by a thorough washing period
of 45 min. in separate experiments, it was found that this
concentration of  xxxd2195xxx  caused complete inhibition of
10 mum  xxxd2925xxx  (pma)-induced contraction (data not shown). subsequently, smooth muscle tone
was raised with  xxxd2586xxx  at 1 m, which concentration was
built up gradually in 3 concentration steps. cumulative concentration–relaxation-curves were constructed using (−)- xxxd2398xxx  (0.1 nm–100 mum), added in 0.5 log increments. at the end
of each experiment, the smooth muscle strips were washed
twice and basal tone was re-established with 10 and 100 mum
 xxxd2398xxx . in all experiments, the reduction of methacholineinduced smooth muscle tone, as a consequence of the preincubation condition, was carefully compensated for by additional
administration of small amounts of the contractile agonist,
before  xxxd2398xxx  relaxation curves were obtained.
2.4. data analysis
responses were expressed as percentages of the response
to 100 mum  xxxd2586xxx  in the second precontraction in each
experiment, with reference to basal tone as established at the
end of each experiment. all data are presented as mean ± s.e.
m. curves were fitted using the logistic 4-parameter model
(sigmaplot 8.0). statistical analysis was performed by means
of the two-tailed student's t-test for paired or unpaired
observations. p values b 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

3. results
3.1. effect of  xxxd2098xxx  treatment on  xxxd2398xxx -induced
relaxation
in order to establish  xxxd2098xxx -induced desensitization of the
 xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation of bovine tracheal smooth
muscle, contracted by 1 mum  xxxd2586xxx , smooth muscle
strips were preincubated with various concentrations of  xxxd2098xxx  for 30 min. both 1 and 10 mum  xxxd2098xxx  significantly
reduced the maximal response (emax) of the  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation from 71.4 ± 2.8% to 64.7 ± 4.2% (p b 0.05)
and 34.6 ± 2.9% (p b 0.001), respectively (fig. 1, table 1),
whereas 0.1 mum  xxxd2098xxx  was ineffective. in contrast, the
potency (pd2) of  xxxd2398xxx  to induce relaxation remained
unchanged (table 1).
3.2. effect of pma treatment on  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation
we also examined the effect of pretreatment with 1 mum
pma, an activator of pkc, on the  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation. fig. 2a shows a small but significant reduction of the
 xxxd2398xxx -induced emax from 71.2 ± 3.2% to 64.2 ± 3.4%
(p b 0.05). no change was found in the pd2 value of  xxxd2398xxx  (table 2).

emax and pd2 values were significantly increased compared to
their respective controls in the absence of  xxxd2195xxx  (table

without 1 mum pma, the potency of  xxxd2398xxx  in the presence
of  xxxd2195xxx  was significantly decreased (fig. 2b, table 2),

3.3. effect of the combination of pma and  xxxd2098xxx  on

in fig. 2b it is shown that combined pretreatment of pma
(1 mum) and  xxxd2098xxx  (1 mum) caused a significant potentiation
of the desensitization of  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation by
 xxxd2098xxx  (fig. 2b) or pma (fig. 2a) alone. the decrease in
emax for the combined treatment was significantly (p b 0.05)
different from the sum of the individual effects of  xxxd2098xxx  and
pma preincubation (table 2). again, the potency of  xxxd2398xxx  was not significantly changed.

4. discussion
the present study has established that activation of pkc by
pma causes a marked aggravation of beta2-agonist-induced beta2adrenoceptor desensitization.
preincubation of bovine tracheal smooth muscle with 1 mum
 xxxd2098xxx  for 30 min caused a small but significant decrease of
the  xxxd2398xxx -induced maximal relaxation of the  xxxd2586xxx -induced contraction, whereas no effect was found on the
potency of  xxxd2398xxx . with 10 mum  xxxd2098xxx  the emax of
 xxxd2398xxx  was markedly reduced, indicating a concentration-dependent desensitization of the  xxxg92xxx . both
pka- and grk-mediated phosphorylation of the  xxxg92xxx  could account for this effect. for  xxxd2398xxx , it has
been established that at low receptor occupancy (agonist concentration b 10 nm) the pka pathway is selectively activated
(lohse et al., 1990), whereas with higher agonist concentrations (n 50 nm), grk-induced desensitization is quantitatively
more important (clark et al., 1999; pitcher et al., 1998; tran et
al., 2004). this would imply that at both concentrations used,
 xxxd2098xxx  caused a desensitization of the beta2 adrenoceptor with a
substantial grk-mediated contribution. to date seven members of the grk family have been identified, but only  xxxg970xxx 
(betaark 1),  xxxg971xxx  (betaark 2) and grk5 appear to be involved
in agonist-induced  xxxg92xxx  phosphorylation (fredericks et al., 1996; menard et al., 1996; stoffel et al., 1997). to
investigate a putative contribution of pkc-activation in this
homologous desensitization by grks, we considered 1 mum
 xxxd2098xxx  to be most appropriate, as the desensitization induced
by this concentration was only small. moreover, in separate
experiments we found that this concentration of  xxxd2098xxx 
causes a submaximal (85.7 ± 2.0%) relaxation of 1 mum  xxxd2586xxx -induced tone (data not shown), indicating that this
concentration is relevant with regard to the relief of bronchoconstriction in severe asthma.
exposure of bovine tracheal smooth muscle to 1 mum pma
for 35 min caused a small but significant decrease in isopren-

aline-induced maximal relaxation, with no effect on the pd2.
activated pkc is most likely responsible for this heterologous
desensitization, as it has been demonstrated in various cells and
tissues that activation of pkc via agonist-induced pi metabolism or phorbol esters may lead to uncoupling of the beta-adrenoceptor, presumably as a result of phosphorylation of the
receptor and/or gs (abdel-latif, 1991; budd et al., 1999;
grandordy et al., 1994; houslay, 1991; meurs et al., 1986;
pyne et al., 1992; sibley and lefkowitz, 1985; yuan et al.,
1994). in addition, we have recently demonstrated the functional relevance of this receptor cross-talk in bovine tracheal
smooth muscle by the marked potentiation of beta-agonist-induced relaxation of cholinergic smooth muscle tone in the
presence of the specific pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  (boterman
et al., 2005). to investigate the capacity of activated pkc to
regulate homologous desensitization, we incubated the bovine
tracheal smooth muscle preparations with the combination of
both 1 mum pma and 1 mum  xxxd2098xxx . this combined treatment
synergistically attenuated the  xxxd2398xxx -induced maximal
relaxation, as compared to the individual effects of pma and
 xxxd2098xxx , indicating a common pathway for heterologous and
homologous desensitization in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.
although in chinese hamster ovary cells, coexpressing the m3muscarinic and  xxxg92xxx , activation of the plc pathway
appeared to have no effect on homologous  xxxg92xxx 
desensitization (budd et al., 1999), it has been shown in mononuclear leukocytes that activated pkc not only increased the
expression of  xxxg970xxx  (de blasi et al., 1995), but also increased
its phosphorylation and activation, resulting in an enhanced
homologous desensitization of the  xxxg92xxx . thus, pretreatment of mononuclear leukocytes with 1 mum pma significantly potentiated the degree of homologous desensitization
induced by the incubation of 10 mum  xxxd2398xxx  for 5 min
(chuang et al., 1995). our results are in agreement with these
findings. moreover, we have found that  xxxd2195xxx  markedly
increased the potency and maximal relaxation of  xxxd2398xxx 
for all conditions used, including control conditions. as
expected, the 1 mum pma-induced desensitization, due to
pkc-mediated phosphorylation of the  xxxg92xxx  and/or
gs, was completely prevented in the presence of  xxxd2195xxx ,
the two concentration–relaxation curves of  xxxd2398xxx  becoming superimposed (fig. 2a). in contrast, the  xxxd2098xxx -induced
homologous desensitization as well as the synergistic effects of
pma and  xxxd2098xxx  were incompletely prevented, the positions
of the two concentration–relaxation curves in the presence of
 xxxd2195xxx  being significantly right from the corresponding
control curve (fig. 2b, table 2). these findings indicate that
part of the grk-mediated desensitization induced by  xxxd2098xxx ,
alone or in combination with pma, is not susceptible to potentiation by pkc. it is also possible, however, that this pkcinsensitive component represents the pka-mediated desensitization. interestingly, pka-mediated phosphorylation of  xxxg970xxx ,
enhancing  xxxg92xxx  phosphorylation and desensitization, was recently found in hek 293 cells (cong et al.,
2001). this opens the fascinating possibility that both pkc
and pka are able to potentiate desensitization by phosphorylation of grks.

m. boterman et al. / european journal of pharmacology 529 (2006) 151–156

in conclusion, the present study not only confirms our
previous findings, showing that pkc is directly involved in
the acute functional cross-talk between the muscarinic m3
receptor and  xxxg92xxx  in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (boterman et al., 2005), but also that homologous desensitization of the  xxxg92xxx  can be enhanced by pkcactivation, presumably by phosphorylation and activation of
grks, indicating that the efficacy of homologous desensitization indeed can be modulated heterologously. for the first time
we have provided evidence that this concept is functionally
operative in airway smooth muscle. it may be of great functional importance for the development of a reduced bronchodilator response in patients with severe asthma. thus, various
inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters released during
a severe exacerbation are known to cause activation of pkc in
airway smooth muscle cells (barnes, 1998). prolonged inhalation of beta2-agonists during such an exacerbation may therefore
lead to aggravation of the homologous beta2-agonist-induced
desensitization due to the mediator- and neurotransmitterinduced activation of pkc, causing further activation of
grks.
