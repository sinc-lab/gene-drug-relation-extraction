sex-related differences in the antinociceptive effects of opioids:
importance of rat genotype, nociceptive stimulus intensity,
and efficacy at the µ opioid receptor

abstract rationale: recent studies indicate that morphine is more potent as an antinociceptive agent in male
than female rodents and monkeys. objectives: to evaluate the influence of sex, nociceptive stimulus intensity
and an opioid’s relative efficacy on opioid-induced antinociception in rat strains (f344 and lewis) that display
differential sensitivity to morphine antinociception.
methods: antinociceptive testing was conducted using a
rat warm-water (50–56°c) tail-withdrawal procedure.
dose–response and time-course determinations were
performed with various opioids. results: across the nociceptive stimulus intensities tested, the high-efficacy µ
opioids morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol were
equally effective in males and females, but on average
2.5-fold more potent in males. at moderate stimulus intensities, the low-efficacy µ opioid buprenorphine was
approximately 0.4-fold more potent in males, and at
higher stimulus intensities more potent and effective
(greater maximal effect) in males. at low stimulus intensities, the low-efficacy µ opioid  xxxd1864xxx  and the µ/kappa
opioid butorphanol were greater than 8.9-fold more potent in males, and at moderate stimulus intensities were
more potent and effective in males. at a low stimulus intensity, the µ/kappa opioid nalbuphine was more potent and
effective in males. at stimulus intensities in which buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and nalbuphine produced maximal effects in males but not females, these
opioids antagonized the effects of morphine in females.
genotype-related differences were noted as opioids were
generally more potent in f344 than lewis males, whereas no consistent differences were observed between f344
and lewis females. conclusions: that sex differences in
the potency and effectiveness of opioids increased with

introduction
sex differences in morphine-induced antinociception
have been described in rodent nociceptive assays using
thermal, chemical, and electrical stimuli (cicero et al.
1996, 1997; kepler et al. 1989; kest et al. 1999). when
sex differences are observed, morphine is generally
1.3–6.9 times more potent in males than females. comparable findings have been reported in rhesus monkeys
when tested using the warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure, where morphine is approximately twofold more
potent in males than in ovariectomized females (negus
and mello 1999). pharmacokinetic factors cannot account for these sex differences, as acute morphine administration in male and female rodents results in comparable morphine brain and serum levels (craft et al.
1996; cicero et al. 1997). additionally, sex differences
are still apparent when pharmacokinetic factors are minimized, such as when morphine is administered intracerebroventricularly (kest et al. 1999) or into the rostral
ventromedial medulla (boyer et al. 1998).
several factors are known to contribute to sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception, including dose,
type of assay, and testing conditions (cicero et al. 1996;
bartok and craft 1997; kest et al. 1999). of particular
importance is genotype, as the antinociceptive potency
of morphine can vary markedly between males and females of various inbred mouse strains. for example,
kest et al. (1999) recently reported that, using the
warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure, morphine was
3.7- to 6.9-fold more potent in males of three mouse

431

strains (akr/j, c57bl/6j, swr/j), equally potent in
seven strains (129, a, balb/c, c3h/he, dba/2, lp,
sjl), and 5.0-fold more potent in females of one strain
(cba/j). although there are data suggesting that sex
differences in morphine-induced antinociception are
more pronounced in sprague-dawley than wistar furth
rats (kasson and george 1984), studies directly addressing this issue in rats have not been reported.
recent studies also suggest that the magnitude of
sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception can
be influenced by the opioid’s relative efficacy. in rhesus monkeys, sex differences have been observed with
morphine but not with the higher efficacy µ opioid fentanyl (negus and mello 1999). the sex differences observed with butorphanol and nalbuphine, low-efficacy
opioids which are active at both µ and kappa opioid receptors, are even larger than those obtained with morphine
and more pronounced when tests are conducted with a
high-intensity nociceptive stimulus. similarly, there is
evidence that strain differences in the antinociceptive
effects of opioids in male rats also increase with decreases in the relative efficacy of the opioid and with
increases in the intensity of the nociceptive stimulus
(morgan et al. 1999a; sudakov et al. 1993). whereas
the antinociceptive potency of high-efficacy µ opioids
(morphine, levorphanol) are less than 8.0 times more
potent in f344 than in lewis rats, there are marked differences in both the potency and effectiveness of lower
efficacy opioids (morgan et al. 1999a). for example, at
low and moderate nociceptive stimulus intensities, buprenorphine is approximately 3.4–19 times more potent
in f344 than in lewis males and, at high nociceptive
stimulus intensities, buprenorphine produces a maximal
effect in f344 males and a submaximal effect in lewis
males. as with sex differences in opioid sensitivity in
rodents, pharmacokinetic factors (gosnell and krahn
1993; guitart et al. 1993) and differences in absolute µ
opioid receptor numbers (sudakov et al. 1993; elmer et
al. 1995) cannot completely account for these strain
differences.
the present study examined the role of nociceptive
stimulus intensity and the relative efficacy of opioids in
determining sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception. comparisons were made between f344 and
lewis rats, as males of these strains are known to differ
markedly in their sensitivity to the antinociceptive
(morgan et al. 1999a) and reinforcing (sudakov et al.
1993) effects of µ opioids as well as their basal levels of
opioid peptides (nylander et al. 1995). if there are differences across rodent strains and within a strain between the sexes in the underlying receptor mechanisms
mediating opioid antinociception, differences would be
most apparent under conditions that require maximal usage of the opioid system, such as when high efficacy
tasks are employed (i.e., tasks that require a large proportion of receptors to be activated for a drug to produce an effect) and when opioids with low efficacy are
tested (i.e., opioids that require activation of a large
fraction of the receptor pool to produce an effect). con-

sequently, tests were conducted across a range of nociceptive stimulus intensities (water temperature) using
relatively high- (morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , levorphanol) and
low-efficacy µ opioids (buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx ) that
have been shown to produce their antinociceptive effects via activation of the µ opioid receptor (adams et
al. 1990; gerak et al. 1994; smith et al. 1999; walker et
al. 1998, 1999). additional tests were conducted with
opioids that are active at both µ and kappa opioid receptors
(butorphanol, nalbuphine), but possess low efficacy at
both receptor sites (leander 1983; walker et al. 1994;
smith et al. 1999).
finally, a characteristic of low-efficacy drugs is that
their agonist and antagonist effects are determined, in
part, by the intensity of the nociceptive stimulus. as the
intensity of the nociceptive stimulus increases, the agonist effects of these drugs systematically decrease. further, under conditions in which low-efficacy drugs fail to
produce a maximal response, these drugs antagonize the
effects produced by higher efficacy agonists (kenakin
1993). thus, in order to demonstrate that the failure of
an opioid to produce a maximal response at higher nociceptive stimulus intensities in a given strain or sex reflects low efficacy at the µ opioid receptor and not the
failure to test sufficiently high doses or sex/strain differences in the pharmacokinetic actions of the drug, antagonism tests were conducted in which these opioids were
administered in combination with a higher efficacy opioid (i.e., morphine).

materials and methods
animals
intact (non-gonadectomized) male and female f344 and lewis
rats were obtained from charles river suppliers (raleigh, n.c.).
all testing occurred between 3 and 6 months of age, and during
the testing period male f344 rats weighed approximately 320 g,
male lewis rats approximately 350 g, female f344 rats approximately 180 g, and female lewis rats approximately 220 g. all rats
had unlimited access to water and food, although food intake for
male rats of the lewis strain was occasionally limited to ensure
proper fit in the restraint tubes. all rats were individually housed
in a colony maintained on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle.
apparatus and testing
on at least two separate occasions prior to the start of testing, each
rat was habituated to plastic restraint tubes for approximately
30 min. during tests for antinociception, rats were placed in the
restraint tubes with their tails hanging freely over the edge of a table, and the distal 7 cm of the tail was immersed into an insulated
mug containing water taken from water baths maintained at each
designated temperature. the latency to tail-withdrawal was then
recorded at 40°c (control) and then at water temperatures ranging
from 50°c to 56°c. tests at each temperature were separated by
2–3 min. two temperatures were examined in a single test session,
with the exception of butorphanol when three temperatures were
tested. a 15-s cut-off was imposed in all tests to minimize tissue
damage.
after baseline latencies were recorded, the first injection of
drug was administered i.p. and, after 15 min, the latency to remove the tail from the water was determined. each of the water

432
temperatures was presented once, with the order of testing counterbalanced across rats. immediately following these tests, the
next drug dose was administered such that each successive dose
increased the total drug concentration by 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 log
units. fifteen minutes after the drug injection, latency to tail withdrawal from the water was again determined. this procedure continued until the maximal effect obtained at a given dose was greater than 80% or until the highest possible dose without producing
toxic effects was tested; all tests lasted between 2 and 4 h. during
combination tests with morphine, a single dose of buprenorphine,
 xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, or nalbuphine was administered with the
latency to remove the tail recorded 15 min later. next, the first
dose of morphine was administered, and testing continued in the
manner described above.
one hundred and fifty-two rats were used, with each drug tested in five to six rats. no rat was exposed to the testing procedures
described above on more than eight occasions and at least 6 days
separated each test. unpublished observations from our laboratory
indicate that, under conditions in which tests are separated by at
least 6 days, repeated dose–response curves can be determined for
morphine with no evidence of the development of tolerance.
time-course procedure
baseline tail-withdrawal latencies were obtained as described
above. subsequently, a dose of morphine or  xxxd1864xxx  was administered and, 15 min later, latency to remove the tail at water temperatures of 52°c and 55°c was re-determined. tail-withdrawal
latencies were determined 15, 30, and 60 min post-drug administration and continued every 60 min until tail-withdrawal latencies
approximated control values.
temperature–effect determination
for two tests, no drugs were administered and rats were tested
with water temperatures ranging from 50°c to 56°c. no more
than three temperatures were examined in any given test with each
temperature presented twice and the average of the two tests recorded.
data analysis
for dose–response and time-course testing, latencies to tail-withdrawal following administration of drug were converted to percentage maximal effect using the following equation: % antinociceptive effect =[(observed-baseline)/(15 s-baseline)]×100. the
dose of each drug required to produce 50% maximal antinociceptive effect was derived mathematically (least-squares method) using log-linear interpolation with at least three doses on the ascending limb of the dose–effect curve. in order to determine differences in drug potency across strains and sexes, relative potency
estimates were calculated (procedure 11, tallarida and murray
1987). analyses of the temperature–effect curves were conducted
using a repeated-measures analysis of variance (anova) with sex
and strain as the between-groups factors and temperature as the repeated-measures factor. simple effects analyses (pairwise comparisons) were then conducted to examine the effect of sex within a
rat strain and the effect of strain within a sex at each temperature.
for the time-course analyses, the area under the curve was estimated using the trapezoidal rule (procedure 25, tallarida and murray 1987). a repeated-measures anova with sex and strain as
the between-groups factors and temperature and dose as the repeated-measures factors was then conducted on the area under the
curve and peak antinociceptive effect. simple effects analyses
were conducted at each temperature, examining the effect of rat
strain within a sex as well as the effect of sex within a rat strain. in
order to determine whether the rank order of potency and effectiveness of each drug tested was similar across male and female
f344 and lewis rats, spearman’s rank order correlation coeffi-

cient was performed. for all statistical analyses, the alpha level
was set at 0.05.
drugs
the following drugs were used:  xxxd2670xxx , buprenorphine
hcl,  xxxd2070xxx  hcl (all provided by the national institute on drug
abuse), butorphanol tartrate (sigma-aldrich co., st. louis, mo.),
levorphanol tartrate and nalbuphine hcl (both from research biochemical inc., natick, mass.), and  xxxd1864xxx  hcl (astra pharmaceuticals, westborough, mass.). small amounts of lactic acid were
added to  xxxd1864xxx  and buprenorphine to promote solubility. doses
for all drugs are expressed in terms of the salts. all drugs were
dissolved in distilled water and administered i.p. in an injection
volume of 0.5–1.0 ml/kg.

results
baseline latencies
at 40°c water temperature (control), rats from both
strains and sexes failed to withdraw their tail by the 15-s
cut-off time. figure 1 shows tail-withdrawal latencies for
water temperatures ranging from 50°c to 56°c in both
male and female rats of the f344 and lewis strains. a
repeated-measures anova indicated a main effect for
strain (f1,18=34.81, p<0.05), but not sex (f1,18=1.21,
p>0.05) with no strain by sex interaction (f1,18=2.97,
p>0.05). additionally, effects were observed for temperature (f1,18=469.65, p<0.05), temperature by strain interaction (f1,18=5.28, p<0.05), and temperature by sex interaction (f1,18=12.60, p<0.05). examination of the effect of sex within a rat strain indicated that f344 males
and females had similar latencies at the temperatures
tested, whereas lewis males had longer latencies (pairwise comparisons, p<0.05) than lewis females at water
temperatures of 50°c and 53°c. strain differences were
also noted, as f344 females had longer latencies than
lewis females at each temperature tested (p<0.05) and
f344 males had longer latencies than lewis males at 51,
52, 54, and 55°c (p<0.05).

morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol
figure 2 shows that at a water temperature of 56°c, for
both male and female f344 and lewis rats, morphine,
 xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol produced dose-dependent increases in tail-withdrawal latencies, with maximal
(>80%) or near maximal effects obtained at the highest
dose tested. similar effects were obtained when these
drugs were tested at a water temperature of 52°c (data
not shown). as shown in table 1, in almost all instances, the ed50 values for these drugs increased with increases in water temperature and, on average (collapsed
across strains), these drugs were 2.6-fold and 2.2-fold
more potent at 52°c than 56°c water temperature in
males and females, respectively. as shown in table 2,
when collapsed across f344 and lewis rats, morphine,
 xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol were either more potent in
males or equally potent in males and females. across
the stimulus intensities examined, morphine,  xxxd2070xxx ,
and levorphanol were on average 2.5-fold more potent
in males, and, with one exception, the magnitude of the
observed sex differences did not exceed 3.8-fold. table 3 shows the relative potency of morphine,  xxxd2070xxx ,
and levorphanol in f344 rats of both sexes relative to
lewis rats. strain differences in the relative potency of
these opioids were not consistently observed across the
stimulus intensities.
buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx 
figure 3 shows that at a water temperature of 52°c, buprenorphine produced maximal effects in f344 males
and females and was 8.0 times more potent in males (ta-

at a 0.3-mg/kg dose, whereas even a dose as high as

females. similar sex differences were obtained in lewis
rats, where at 52°c buprenorphine was 12.9 times more
potent in males (table 2) and, at 56°c, the highest dose

of buprenorphine tested produced near maximal effects
in lewis males and only a 36% effect in females. for
both f344 and lewis rats, the maximal effect obtained
with buprenorphine at the water temperature of 56°c
was greater (p<0.05) in males (table 2). based on the
ed50 values, buprenorphine was approximately 4.0- and
12-fold more potent at the 52°c than the 56°c temperature in f344 and lewis males, respectively (table 1).
these values could not be calculated for females, as less
than maximal effects were obtained at 56°c. when compared across strains, buprenorphine was generally more
potent in f344 than in lewis males and in f344 than
lewis females (table 3).
figure 4 shows that, in f344 males,  xxxd1864xxx  produced maximal effects at each temperature tested,
whereas in females maximal effects were obtained at
50°c and intermediate (<50%) effects at both 52°c and
55°c. relative potency estimates indicated that at the
water temperatures of 50°c and 52°c,  xxxd1864xxx  was 23
and 60 times more potent in males, respectively (table 4). in lewis rats,  xxxd1864xxx  was equipotent and effective in males and females at 50°c, more potent and effective in males at 52°c, and ineffective in both males
and females at 55°c. in all instances, the ed50 values for
 xxxd1864xxx  increased with increases in temperature and, on
average (collapsed across strains),  xxxd1864xxx  was 4.8-fold
and 102-fold more potent at the water temperature of
50°c than 52°c in males and females, respectively (table 5). when collapsed across the temperatures,  xxxd1864xxx 
was more potent in f344 than in lewis males, whereas
no consistent potency differences were obtained between
f344 and lewis females (table 6).
butorphanol and nalbuphine
as shown in fig. 5, at water temperatures of 50°c and

at 55°c, butorphanol was minimally effective in both
males and females. in lewis rats, butorphanol produced
maximal effects at 50°c in both males and females and
was 8.9 times more potent in males (table 4). maximal
effects were also obtained in males at 52°c, whereas in

as described above, buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and nalbuphine produced maximal effects in
males under conditions in which submaximal or minimal effects were obtained in females. to determine
whether this was a consequence of these opioids having
low efficacy at the µ opioid receptor, the failure to test
sufficiently high doses, or a pharmacokinetic action
that limited the opioids access to µ opioid receptors,
these opioids were administered in combination with
morphine in f344 and lewis females. in these tests, a
leftward shift in the morphine dose–effect curve would
indicate that an insufficient dose range was examined
and that doses higher than those tested would probably
have produced a maximal effect, or that the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug limited access to µ opioid
receptors. in contrast, a rightward shift (antagonism) of
the curve would be indicative of low efficacy at the µ
opioid receptor. figure 7 shows the effects of morphine

and lewis females, respectively (data not shown). in
both rat strains, a dose of butorphanol that produced
minimal effects alone flattened the morphine dose–effect
curve such that even a dose as high as 100 mg/kg failed
to produce a maximal effect. comparable effects were
obtained in tests conducted at 55°c (data not shown). a
dose of nalbuphine that had little effect in f344 females
produced a 6.9- and 5.1-fold rightward shift in the morphine dose–effect curve at the water temperatures of
50°c and 52°c (data not shown), respectively. similar
effects were obtained in lewis females at 50°c and 52°c
(data not shown), where nalbuphine produced a 7.8- and

curve, respectively.

also shown in fig. 7 is the finding that, at 52°c,  xxxd1864xxx  produced a 55% effect in f344 females and a

doses of morphine produced greater effects in lewis
than f344 males (p<0.05), but differences were not obtained between f344 and lewis females. the time
course of morphine in f344 and lewis rats at a water
temperature of 55°c was similar to that obtained at
52°c.
the time-course effects of several doses of  xxxd1864xxx  in
male and female f344 and lewis rats at 52°c are also
shown in fig. 8. because  xxxd1864xxx  was more potent in
males, different yet equieffective doses were tested. analyses were conducted only on the common dose of  xxxd1864xxx  (10 mg/kg) and, at this dose, area under the curve
analyses indicated main effects for strain (f1,19=5.30,
p<0.05) and sex (f1,19=43.90, p<0.05), but not temperature (f1,19=2.01, p>0.05). examination of the effect of
sex within a strain indicated that the effect of  xxxd1864xxx 
was greater in males of both strains than their female

counterparts (p<0.05). the effects of rat strain indicated
that  xxxd1864xxx  was equieffective in f344 and lewis males,
as well as between f344 and lewis females. analyses
conducted on the peak effect of  xxxd1864xxx  indicated differences for strain (f1,19=4.90, p<0.05), sex (f1,19=44.06,
p<0.05), temperature (f1,19=18.98, p<0.05), and for a
temperature by sex interaction (f1,19=11.70, p<0.05). the
peak effect of  xxxd1864xxx  was greater in f344 males than
females (p<0.05) and greater in lewis males than females (p<0.05). in contrast, the peak effect of  xxxd1864xxx 
was similar in f344 and lewis males and in f344 and
lewis females. although the magnitude of the effects
produced by  xxxd1864xxx  at 55°c was smaller than that obtained at 52°c, differences between males and females at
55°c were comparable with those obtained at 52°c.

comparison of the relative potency and effectiveness
of opioids
at the lowest temperature in which maximal effects were
obtained in f344 and lewis rats of both sexes (50°c:  xxxd1864xxx , 52°c:  xxxd2070xxx , buprenorphine, morphine, levorphanol), the relative potencies of the µ opioids examined was significantly (p<0.05) correlated across females (r=1.0), males and females of the f344 strain
(r=1.0), and collapsed across sex and strain (r=0.93).
high correlations were also obtained between males
(r=0.70) and between lewis males and females (r=0.70),
although these were not significant. when collapsed
across strains and sexes, the following rank order of potency was obtained:  xxxd2070xxx  > buprenorphine >  xxxd1864xxx  > levorphanol > morphine. butorphanol and nalbuphine were not included in this analysis as, in addition to
having activity at both µ and kappa opioid receptors, there
were a number of instances in which these opioids failed
to produce a maximal effect in the females. a similar
analysis was conducted on the effectiveness of these opioids in producing an antinociceptive effect at the different water temperatures. the relative effectiveness of
these opioids was significantly (p<0.05) correlated
across males (r=0.99), females (r=0.97), males and females of the f344 (r=0.99) and lewis (r=1.0) strains,
and collapsed across sex and strain (r=0.96). when collapsed across strains, sexes, and temperatures, the rank
order of effectiveness of the opioids tested was  xxxd2070xxx 
= levorphanol = morphine > buprenorphine >  xxxd1864xxx  >
butorphanol > nalbuphine.

discussion
the present study provides evidence of sex-related differences in both the potency and antinociceptive effectiveness of various opioids. the magnitude of these sex
differences generally increased with decreases in the relative efficacy of the opioids and with increases in the nociceptive stimulus intensity (water temperature). with
lower efficacy opioids, maximal effects were frequently
obtained in males under conditions in which these opioids antagonized morphine-induced antinociception in females. strain-related differences in sensitivity to opioidinduced antinociception were also observed, as lower efficacy opioids were more potent in f344 than lewis
males and, in general, the magnitude of these strain differences were more pronounced at higher stimulus intensities. in contrast, there were no consistent differences in
the potency or effectiveness of the opioids examined between the f344 and lewis females. as a consequence of
the strain-related differences in males but not females,
the sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception
were generally larger in f344 than in lewis rats.
the rankings of relative potency ( xxxd2070xxx  > buprenorphine >  xxxd1864xxx  > levorphanol > morphine) and efficacy ( xxxd2070xxx  = levorphanol = morphine > buprenorphine >  xxxd1864xxx ) of the µ opioids examined in the

present investigation were generally comparable across
strains and sexes and were similar to those obtained in
other rodent strains, in other species, and other µ-opioid-sensitive assays (young et al. 1991, 1992; picker et
al. 1993; tiano et al. 1998; morgan et al. 1999b). such
findings suggest that, in males and females of the f344
and lewis strains, these opioids are active at the µ receptor and most likely share a common mechanism of
action. that the potency of  xxxd1864xxx  and buprenorphine
for antagonizing the effects of morphine was also comparable in f344 and lewis females suggests that the
relative affinity of these opioids for the µ receptor was
not influenced by genotype. in contrast to the µ opioids
examined, butorphanol and nalbuphine have activity at
both the µ and kappa opioid receptors and it is not completely clear as to which opioid receptor(s) mediates
their antinociceptive effects (leander 1983; walker et
al. 1994; smith et al. 1999). nevertheless, the finding
that these opioids antagonized the effects of morphine
in the f344 and lewis females indicates that, in females, their relative efficacy at the µ receptor was lower than that of the µ opioids examined. comparable µ
antagonist potencies for butorphanol and nalbuphine
have been also obtained in sprague-dawley and long
evans male rats (young et al. 1992; walker et al. 1994;
morgan et al. 1999b).
the sex-related potency differences obtained with the
high-efficacy µ opioids morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol in f344 and lewis rats are in agreement with reports of sex differences in morphine-induced antinociception in sprague-dawley rats (cicero et al. 1996,
1997). it should be noted, however, that several reports
have failed to identify sex differences in sensitivity to
morphine, and these inconsistencies may be related to
dose, strain, testing conditions, or type of opioid tested
(kasson and george 1984; islam et al. 1993; bartok and
craft 1997; kest et al. 1999; negus and mello 1999).
similarly, in the present investigation, sex differences
were not observed with the high-efficacy µ opioids  xxxd2070xxx  in f344 rats or morphine in lewis rats, and the
magnitude of the sex differences with morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol varied slightly across nociceptive
stimulus intensities. if there are fundamental sex differences in the physiological mechanisms that underlie opioid sensitivity, then it might be predicted that differences
in the potency of opioids would be least apparent (or occur only under a limited set of conditions) with the higher efficacy µ opioids, as they require activation of so few
receptors to produce a response.
in contrast to effects obtained with the high-efficacy
µ opioids, marked strain and sex differences were obtained with the lower efficacy µ opioids buprenorphine
and  xxxd1864xxx , as well as with the mixed µ/kappa opioids butorphanol and nalbuphine. for example, at a water temperature of 52°c, buprenorphine was equally effective
in males and females, but approximately ten times more
potent in males. at 56°c, buprenorphine produced maximal or near maximal effects in males and only intermediate (<50%) effects in females. the magnitude of the

440

sex differences obtained with  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol,
and nalbuphine was greater than that obtained with buprenorphine, and these opioids were also less effective
antinociceptive agents than buprenorphine. further, at
some water temperatures, these opioids produced maximal antinociceptive effects in males and were ineffective in females.
of particular importance is that, under conditions in
which buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and nalbuphine produced maximal effects in males and failed to
produce maximal effects in females, these opioids antagonized the effects of the higher efficacy µ opioid morphine. such findings would be predicted if buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and nalbuphine were functioning as low-efficacy µ opioids, as under conditions in
which a low-efficacy compound fails to produce a maximal effect in a given preparation it should antagonize the
effects produced by a more efficacious compound acting
at the same receptor site (kenakin 1993). that at the
higher water temperatures these opioids produced a maximal response only in males and antagonized the effects
of morphine in females suggests further that sex differences in the potency and effectiveness of these low-efficacy opioids in females was not a consequence of sex
differences in opioid pharmacokinetics (craft et al. 1996;
cicero et al. 1997). as such, these findings indicate that
the effects of buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and
nalbuphine varied between the sexes in terms of their potency and efficacy at the µ opioid receptor. similarly, in
rhesus monkeys, butorphanol and nalbuphine are both
more potent and effective as antinociceptive agents in
males than ovariectomized females (negus and mello
1999). in contrast, in a time-course assessment, the potency and effectiveness of buprenorphine has been reported to be similar in male and female sprague-dawley
rats (bartok and craft 1997). these discrepancies may
reflect procedural or strain differences.
there are several possible explanations for the sex
and strain differences observed in the potency and effectiveness of opioids. in particular, some studies indicate a
correlation between non-drug nociceptive latencies and
sensitivity to morphine-induced antinociception with
morphine being more potent in the strains with the longer non-drug latencies (mogil et al. 1996, 1997; elmer et
al. 1998). in the present investigation, the baseline tailwithdrawal latencies were longer for f344 males than
lewis males and the opioids examined were generally
more potent in f344 males. this relationship was not,
however, apparent between f344 and lewis females or
between males and females of the same strain. for example, in both f344 and lewis rats, the males and females
exhibited similar baseline latencies, yet female rats were
less sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of µ opioids
than their male counterparts.
restraint stress may have also played a role in determining sex and strain differences, as previous investigations indicate that the initial physiological stress response is larger in f344 than in lewis male rats
(dhabhar et al. 1996). although restraint stress can po-

tentiate the antinociceptive effects of morphine, the magnitude of this potentiation has been shown to be comparable in f344 and lewis rats (woolfolk and holtzman
1995). moreover, this potentiation is reduced with increased habituation to the stressor (calcagnetti and
holtzman 1990) and in the present study all rats were
initially habituated to the restraint tubes on multiple occasions and a preliminary assessment of a morphine
dose–effect curve was obtained (not used in any analyses). as such, the role of restraint stress in accounting for
obtained differences between the sexes and strains was
probably minimal.
alternatively, these findings appear to suggest that the
relative efficacy (i.e., relative fractional receptor reserve)
of opioids is greater in male than female rats. it is well
established that as the intensity of a nociceptive stimulus
increases, the potency of an opioid in producing an antinociceptive response decreases as more and more receptors need to be activated. at some point, opioids that
bind to a large proportion of the receptor population cannot activate a sufficient number of receptors to produce a
response (i.e., low-efficacy opioids). as such, these lower efficacy opioids will produce a maximal response using low- but not high-intensity nociceptive stimuli. further, as the maximal response produced by a low-efficacy opioid decreases, there is an increase in its ability to
antagonize the effects of higher efficacy opioids
(kenakin 1993). consistent with these predictions, in the
present investigation, the potency and effectiveness of
buprenorphine,  xxxd1864xxx , butorphanol, and nalbuphine
decreased with increases in water temperature, and these
opioids antagonized the effects of morphine in females
under conditions in which they produced maximal effects in males. thus, under conditions requiring maximal
receptor occupancy or maximal usage of the opioid receptor system, relatively large sex differences may be
apparent in both the potency and effectiveness of an opioid. such findings would suggest that sex differences in
the potency of morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol also
reflect their greater relative efficacy in males. whether
these differences are a consequence of differences in the
relative density and/or sensitivity (e.g., receptor–effector
coupling mechanisms) of the µ opioid receptor population remains to be determined.
the present findings have a number of implications
for examining sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception. first, the failure to obtain sex differences in
the antinociceptive potency of high-efficacy µ opioids in
a particular strain or under a particular condition may not
predict whether males and females are equally sensitive
to lower efficacy opioids. second, sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception are most apparent under
conditions that require maximal usage of the opioid
system, such as when high-efficacy tasks are employed
and when opioids with low efficacy are tested. third, the
combined use of low-efficacy opioids and high-intensity
nociceptive stimuli to maximize sex differences may facilitate strategies developed for identifying the specific
genes that underlie opioid-induced antinociception

441

(mogil et al. 1999). finally, the role of sex hormones on
opioid sensitivity has not been clearly elucidated as the
results of male and female gonadectomies on sensitivity
to morphine’s antinociceptive effects are inconsistent
and vary across assays and testing conditions (kepler et
al. 1989; ali et al. 1995; negus and mello 1999). since
the magnitude of sex differences in morphine’s antinociceptive effects in non-ovariectomized animals is typically small, enhancing these differences by utilizing lower
efficacy opioids may provide a more sensitive assay.
