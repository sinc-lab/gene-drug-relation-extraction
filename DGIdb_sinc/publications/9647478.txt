1 we have used patch-clamp methods to study the eects of the detergents, cremophor, tween 80 and
triton x100 on the  xxxg1253xxx  in the pancreatic b-cell from mouse.
2 all three detergents blocked  xxxg1253xxx  activity with the following order of potency: tween 80
(ki5*83 nm)4triton x100 (ki=350 nm)4cremophor. in all cases the block was poorly reversible.
3 single-channel studies suggested that at low doses, the detergents act as slow blockers of the katp
channel.
4 unlike the block produced by  xxxd3394xxx , that produced by detergent was not aected by
intracellular mg2+-nucleotide,  xxxd1868xxx  or trypsin treatment, nor did it involve an acceleration of
rundown or increase in atp sensitivity of the chanel.
5 the detergents could block the pore-forming subunit, kir6.2dc26, which can be expressed
independently of  xxxg19xxx  (the regulatory subunit of the  xxxg1253xxx ). these data suggest that the
detergents act on  xxxg1250xxx  and not  xxxg19xxx .
6 the detergents had no eect on another member of the inward recti®er family: kir1.1a ( xxxg1249xxx ).
7 voltage-dependent k-currents in the b-cell were reversibly blocked by the detergents with a far lower
potency than that found for the  xxxg1253xxx .
8 like other insulin secretagogues that act by blocking the  xxxg1253xxx , cremophor elevated
intracellular ca2+ in single b-cells to levels that would be expected to elicit insulin secretion.
9 given the role of the  xxxg1253xxx  in many physiological processes, we conclude that plasma borne
detergent may have pharmacological actions mediated through blockage of the  xxxg1253xxx

introduction
closure of the  xxxd83xxx  (atp)-sensitive
 xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1253xxx ) is a key component in the
mechanism by which glucose and other metabolites stimulate
insulin secretion from pancreatic b-cells (ashcroft & rorsman,
1989). katp channels constitute the dominant potassium
permeability of the b-cell plasma membrane, the extent of
 xxxg1253xxx  activity controlling the membrane potential of
the b-cell (smith et al., 1990). it is widely thought that the
activity of the  xxxg1253xxx  in the pancreatic b-cell is primarily
controlled by the ratio of cytosolic atp/adp (ashcroft &
rorsman, 1989). at low, subthreshold, glucose concentrations
(55 mm) the cytosolic atp/adp ratio is low and the activity
of the  xxxg1253xxx  results in a hyperpolarized membrane
potential (*770 mv). as the glucose concentration is raised,
the concomitant increase in cell metabolism and the atp/adp
ratio inhibits the katp channels which results in depolarization
of the membrane potential. if this depolarization is suciently
large (4750 mv), ca2+-dependent action potentials are
elicited, promoting in¯ux of ca2+ into the b-cell and
stimulation of insulin secretion (ashcroft & rorsman, 1989;
duchen et al., 1993). this vital role of the  xxxg1253xxx  in the
stimulus-secretion of insulin therefore makes this ion channel
an important target for therapeutic drugs (ashcroft, 1996). it
is well established that sulphonylureas, such as  xxxd2215xxx ,
which are administered to control non-insulin-dependent

diabetes mellitus, directly inhibit the activity of the katp
channel (ashcroft, 1996). in doing so they mimic the action of
glucose and promote insulin secretion. clearly, any circulating
agent which can inhibit the activity of katp channels might be
expected to stimulate insulin secretion and perturb both insulin
and glucose homeostasis, thereby making the  xxxg1253xxx  an
important target for environmental agents.
the molecular structure of the atp-sensitive potassium
channel consists of four inward-recti®er k+ channel poresubunits ( xxxg1250xxx ), and four high anity sulphonylureas
receptor subunits ( xxxg19xxx , inagaki et al., 1995; sakura et al.,
1995; clement et al., 1997).  xxxg19xxx  belongs to the atp-binding
cassette family of proteins (aguilar-byran et al., 1995) which
also contains the multidrug resistance gene (mdr) product, pglycoprotein (p-gp) (bradley et al., 1988).
cremophor is a polyethoxylated castor oil and is a
surfactant commonly used as a vehicle for the parenteral
administration of water insoluble drugs and vitamins. it has
been shown that low doses of cremophor can reverse the
mdr phenotype by blocking the ability of p-gp to transport
lipophilic substances (friche et al., 1990; woodcock et al.,
1992). the improvement in the eectiveness of anti-cancer
drugs against mdr-expressing cells when administered with
cremophor has suggested that this surfactant may have
possible therapeutic potential (woodcock et al., 1992; webster
et al., 1993). two other surfactants (helenius et al., 1979),
triton x100 (non-ionic) and tween 80 (anionic) can also
inhibit p-gp at concentrations that are too low to disrupt
membrane integrity (friche et al., 1990; woodcock et al., 1992;

530

p.a. smith & p. proks

zordan-nudo et al., 1993). considering the structural
homology between  xxxg19xxx  and p-gp, one might expect them
to possess a similar pharmacology. for example tween 80 and
cremophor have both been shown to stimulate smooth muscle
contraction in aortic rings, results that may be interpreted in
terms of an inhibition of katp channels by the detergents
(zengil et al., 1995). using patch-clamp techniques, we have
therefore investigated whether detergents can block katp
channels in pancreatic b-cells and therefore act as insulin
secretagogues. the possible consequences of surfactants on
insulin release and other processes that involve katp channels
are discussed.

methods
b-cell preparation
for this study pancreatic b-cells were prepared from nmri
mice as previously described (duchen et al., 1993). cells were
plated onto glass cover slips or directly onto plastic petri dishes
and maintained for 1 ± 4 days in rpmi 1640 tissue culture
medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 50 mu ml71
penicillin and 50 mg ml71 streptomycin at 378c in a humidi®ed
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air.

molecular biology
we used techniques identical to those described by gribble et
al. (1997). xenopus oocytes were defolliculated and injected
with 2 ng of mrna encoding either a truncated form of
 xxxg1250xxx  (kir6.2dc26) or kir1.1a. currents were measured in
giant inside-out patches excised from oocytes 1 ± 4 days after
injection. mock-injected oocytes had no such currents.

electrophysiology
solutions for whole-cell recordings of k-atp currents in
pancreatic b-cells the standard extracellular (bath) solution
contained (in mm): nacl 140, kcl 5.6, mgcl2 1.2, cacl2 2.6,
hepes 10 (ph 7.4 with naoh). the pipette was ®lled with
either a mgatp or mgatp-free solution. the mgatp
solution contained (in mm): kcl 107, mgcl2 1-2 (free
mg2+*0.6 ± 1.3 mm), cacl2 1 (free ca2+*20 nm), egta
10 and hepes 10 (ph 7.15 with koh; total k*137 mm) and
0.3 mm k2atp. the mgatp-free solution contained (in mm):
kcl 110, cacl2 4.6 (free ca2+*30 nm), edta 10, hepes 10
(ph 7.15 with koh; total k2+*138 mm). for whole-cell
recordings of voltage-gated k+ currents the bath contained the
standard extracellular solution and pipettes were ®lled with the
mgatp solution supplemented with a total of 3 mm k2atp
to block k-atp currents.
in studies on cloned channels in oocytes, the pipette
solution contained (in mm): kcl 140, mgcl2 1.2, cacl2 2.6
and hepes 10 (ph 7.4 with koh). the internal (bath)
solutions were similar to those used in the studies on b-cells;
either the mgatp-free solution or one that contained (in mm):
kcl 110, mgcl2 2, cacl2 1, egta 10 and hepes 10 (ph 7.2
with koh). in the studies on the cloned inward-recti®er k+
channel, kir1.1a ( xxxg1249xxx ), 1 mm atp was included in the
internal solution to maintain channel activity. for these
experiments the detergents were only tested on the cytoplasmic
face of the channel by addition of the compounds directly to
the bath solution.
for outside-out single-channel recordings, pipettes were
®lled with the mgatp-free solution and the bath contained the

effects of detergents on katp channels

standard extracellular solution, for inside-out single-channel
recordings these solutions were reversed such that pipettes
were ®lled with the standard extracellular solution and the
bath contained the mgatp-free solution.
recording methods patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries, coated with sylgard at their tips and
®re-polished immediately before use. membrane currents were
recorded with an epc-7 patch-clamp ampli®er (list electronic, darmstadt, germany). the zero-current potential of the
pipette was adjusted with the pipette in the bath just before
establishment of the seal. no corrections have been made for
the liquid junction potentials (54 mv). only one cell was
studied from each petri dish. all electrophysiological experiments were conducted at room temperature, 23 ± 258c.
whole-cell current analysis whole-cell  xxxg1253xxx  activity
was monitored as the current ¯owing in response to alternate
10 mv depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses of 200 ms in
duration, applied at 0.5 hz (trube et al., 1986). drugs were
tested only after the whole-cell currents had reached a steadystate level (i.e. normally within 5 min after the standard wholecell con®guration had been obtained following the equilibration of the cytosolic solution with the pipette solution). drugcontaining solutions were alternated with control solutions.
due to the slow time course and poor reversibility of the block
by the surfactants, the katp currents in the presence of
surfactant were measured as the fraction of that obtained in
control before exposure to the drug. in the majority of
experiments only one concentration of detergent was tested per
cell, dose-response relationships were constructed by pooling
the data from individual cells. in experiments where rundown
of the katp currents was present, the value for the amplitude
of the control current was estimated by a linear extrapolation
of the control current to the point at which the current
amplitude in detergent was measured.
cloned k-atp channel analysis macroscopic currents of
cloned channels expressed in oocytes were recorded from giant
inside-out patches in response to a 3 s voltage ramp from
7110 to 100 mv (hilgemann et al., 1991). the slope
conductance of the expressed currents was measured by ®tting
a straight line to the linear portion of the data between 720
and 7100 mv; the average of 3 ± 5 consecutive ramps was
calculated for each solution.
single-channel analysis of k-atp currents the membrane
potential was held at 0 mv for both outside-out and inside-out
patch studies. although 0 mv is above the threshold for
activation of both the outward delayed-recti®er and ca2+activated k-channels, both channel types are substantially
inactivated by the continuous depolarization. furthermore,
the free ca2+ concentration in the mgatp free solution
(530 nm) is well below that required for activation of ca2+activated k-channels.
single-channel data were ®ltered with an 8 pole bessel
(73 db at 2 khz) and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz. single-channel
currents were analysed with the half-amplitude threshold
technique following the methods detailed by colquhoun &
sigworth (1995) and were essentially the same as those
described in smith et al. (1994).
in most cases the activity of the k-atp channel was stable
for the lifetime of the patch, with little or no rundown due to
the absence of mg2+ in the cytoplasmic solution (kozlowski &
ashford, 1990). the relationship between the concentration of
detergent and channel activity was determined as described

p.a. smith & p. proks

below. we did not attempt to discriminate between the number
of available channels, n, and their open probability, po.
due to the use of identical electrochemical gradients and
ionic conditions the kinetic and biophysical properties of the
 xxxg1253xxx  were independent of whether they were recorded
in the inside-out or outside-out patch con®gurations. the
eects of the detergents on the kinetic parameters of the singlechannels were indistinguishable whether they had been applied
intracellularly to inside-out patches, or extracellularly to
outside-out patches: because the parameters overlapped
considerably. for these reasons, data from the two patch
con®gurations were pooled.
quanti®cation of inhibition to quantify the degree of
inhibition of currents produced by detergent, the fractional
block was calculated as follows; whole-cell recordings, the
amplitude of the native katp current in the presence of a drug
(i) was expressed as fraction of its amplitude in control
solution (ic), i.e. i/ic; macroscopic recordings, the slopeconductance of the cloned katp current in the presence of a
drug (g) was expressed as fraction of its amplitude in control
solution (gc), i.e. g/gc; single channel recordings, channel
activity in the test solution (npo) was normalized to its value in
control solution (npo ) before exposure to the surfactant i.e.
npo/npo .
mean dose-response curves were ®tted with the modi®ed
hill equation:

where d is the drug concentration, ki is the concentration of
drug which produces half-maximal inhibition of katp, io is the
fractional, drug-insensitive, component and nh is the hill
coecient.
for the display of whole-cell katp current records data
were ®ltered with an 8 pole bessel (73 db  xxxd1891xxx  hz) and
digitized at 200 hz.

voltage-dependent k+ currents
whole-cell voltage-dependent k+ currents (ik(v)) were evoked
from a holding potential of 770 mv by incremental 10 mv
voltage steps of 200 ms duration applied at a frequency of
0.5 hz. to correct for linear leak currents and uncompensated
capacity transients, the current responses of negative voltage
steps to 7100, 790 and 780 mv were scaled, averaged and
subtracted from the raw current traces. the percentage
outward current remaining in the presence of surfactant was
measured as a fraction of that obtained in control solution
before and after exposure to the drug. the k+ conductancevoltage relationship, which is an estimate of the voltagedependence of activation, was calculated by dividing ik(v) by
the estimated electrochemical driving force: vm ± ek, where
vm is the membrane potential and ek is the nernst
equilibrium potential for potassium (*780 mv), assuming
the currents measured are carried solely by k+ ions. no
corrections were made for the voltage errors (54 mv) arising
from the series resistance (3.4+0.2 mo, n=7).

ca2+ measurements
microphotometry with the calcium ¯uorophore, ¯uo-3, was
used to monitor [ca2+]i as described previously (duchen et al.,
1993). cells were incubated with 1 mm ¯uo-3-am ester
(molecular probes, oregon, u.s.a.) at room temperature
(23 ± 258c) for 20 ± 30 min in hank's solution supplemented

with 2.8 mm glucose. the dye was excited at a wavelength of
480 nm and the ¯uorescence monitored at 530 nm. the
¯uorescence signal was ®ltered at 1 ± 10 hz with a 4-pole
bessel ®lter and stored on dat tape pending analysis. the
¯uorescence signals have not been calibrated in terms of
[ca2+]i but are presented as percentage change in signal. as
fluo-3 has a kd for ca2+ of *1 mm (molecular probes)
changes in ¯uorescence are expected to depend linearly on the
[ca2+]i across the physiological range (*100 ± 500 nm).
for these experiments the bath was continuously perfused
with a modi®ed hank's solution which contained (in mm): kcl
5.6, nacl 137, nah2po4 1.2, nahco3 4.2, mgcl2 1.2, cacl2
2.6 and hepes 10 (ph 7.4 with *6 mm naoh) and 2.8 mm
glucose. experiments were conducted at 31 ± 338c to promote
cellular metabolism and quasi-physiological ca2+ handling by
the b-cells (duchen et al., 1993).

reagents
 xxxd3394xxx , cremophor-el, triton x100 and tween-80
(polysorbate-80) were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide
(dmso; ®nal concentration 50.1%).  xxxd1868xxx  (68 mm) was
dissolved in 0.1 mm naoh (®nal added oh equivalents
50.1 mm). all other chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were
obtained from sigma.
the action of trypsin on the ecacy of the detergents was
tested by the application of either 20 or 50 mg ml71 of trypsin
(type ix, sigma) for 5 or 2 min, respectively, to the inner face
of inside-out patches (proks & ashcroft, 1993).

statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean+s.e.mean (n), where n is the
number of samples. statistical signi®cance was determined by
the wilcoxon u-statistic for paired data and mann ± whitney
with correction for ties for unpaired data. p50.05 was
considered signi®cant.

results
we ®rst compared the eects of detergents on standard
whole-cell katp currents, recorded with mgatp-containing
pipette solution, with that of the sulphonylurea,  xxxd3394xxx , a well characterized blocker of this channel (ashcroft,
1996). application of 5 mm  xxxd3394xxx  to the bath caused a
rapid and reversible block of the katp current to 46+4%
(n=12) of its control value (figure 1a). the time course for
both the onset and reversal of the  xxxd3394xxx  block was
limited by the rate of bath perfusion and re¯ects the time
course of the drug concentration in the bath. subsequent
perfusion of 561074% v/v cremophor caused a slow
inhibition of the katp current and produced a steady-state
block within 5 min of application (figure 1a). cremophor
561074% v/v reduced the katp current to 37+6% (n=8)
of its control value. in the majority of whole-cell
experiments, the block produced by cremophor was poorly
reversible (see later).
it is conceivable that our measurement of the block
produced by cremophor is due to, or enhanced by, rundown
of the  xxxg1253xxx : a spontaneous decay in katp current
amplitude which is accelerated by intracellular mg2+
(kozlowski & ashford, 1990). to check for this possibility
the experiments were repeated with a mg2+-free pipette
solution, conditions under which rundown is absent
(kozlowski & ashford, 1990).

katp currents. pipette contained 0.3 mm mgatp.

figure 1b illustrates a typical whole-cell recording of katp
currents made with a mg2+- and nucleotide-free pipette
solution. clearly both  xxxd3394xxx  and cremophor can still
block the katp current.
the time course of the block produced by cremophor was
dose-dependent. in 161075% v/v cremophor, the lowest dose
of cremophor tested, the steady-state block of the katp
current was reached within 5 min of application. at a higher
dose (4261073% v/v) of detergent the steady-state block
caused by cremophor was almost immediate in onset and, like
that produced by  xxxd3394xxx , was limited by the rate of bath
perfusion (data not shown). figure 1c displays the doseresponse relationships for the steady-state block of the katp
channel produced by cremophor. the best ®t of the mean data
with the hill equation was obtained with a ki of 561075% v/v
and nh of 0.7.
although the data in figure 1c suggest that cremophor
appears to be more potent at blocking katp currents in the
absence of mgatp than in its presence, this dierence was not
signi®cant for any of the concentrations of detergent tested.
the ki for cremophor in the absence of mgatp was
2.561074% v/v (nh=0.7).
the drug  xxxd1868xxx  is a speci®c opener of the  xxxg1253xxx ,
it also acts non-competitively to inhibit the block of the katp
channel produced by  xxxd3394xxx  (kozlowski & ashford,
1992; schwanstecher et al., 1992). cloning-expression studies
have demonstrated that, like tobutamide,  xxxd1868xxx  only exerts
its major action on the  xxxg1253xxx  in the presence of  xxxg19xxx 
and not by a direct eect on the inward recti®er subunits

(tucker et al., 1997). we therefore investigated whether the
block of katp by cremophor, like that obtained with
 xxxd3394xxx , was aected by  xxxd1868xxx . bath application of
200 mm  xxxd1868xxx  increased the katp current by 140+14%
(n=4, figure 1d). in agreement with previous work (trube et
al., 1986), the k+-channel opener abolished the block of katp
channels produced by a low concentration of sulphonylurea;
5 mm  xxxd3394xxx  blocked the katp current by 54+4% and
2+1% (n=4) in the absence and presence of 200 mm
 xxxd1868xxx , respectively. however,  xxxd1868xxx  did not prevent
the inhibition of the katp current caused by a concentration of
cremophor of a similar potency to that of 5 mm  xxxd3394xxx 
(figure 1d), although it did reduce the amount the block
caused by the surfactant: 561074% v/v cremophor blocked
the katp current by 66+6% (n=6) and 43+3% (n=4) in the
absence and presence of 200 mm  xxxd1868xxx , respectively. due
to cell to cell variation in the rate of rundown of the katp
currents the signi®cance of this dierence (p=0.04) is dicult
to assess.
on the basis of these results we investigated the idea that
the inhibition of the katp current by cremophor is not
mediated via the sulphonylurea receptor,  xxxg19xxx , but is via a
direct action of the detergent on the inward recti®er subunit,
 xxxg1250xxx . this was achieved by testing the surfactant on
modi®ed atp-sensitive channels (dkatp) which were
assembled from kir6.2dc26. dkatp possesses biophysical
properties similar to those of wild-type katp channels, but
can be expressed independently of the  xxxg19xxx  subunit and is
therefore insensitive to  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd1868xxx  (tucker et

p.a. smith & p. proks

al., 1997). figure 2a shows that application of 0.01% v/v
cremophor to the cytoplasmic face of a giant patch
completely inhibited the current ¯owing through dkatp
channels. at this concentration, cremophor inhibited dkatp
currents by 94+3% (n=3). this is a similar degree of block
to that produced by the same concentration of detergent on
the wild-type  xxxg1253xxx  (82%). likewise the block was
irreversible over the time course of the experiment.
cremophor 0.01% v/v applied in the absence of internal
mgatp also blocked dkatp by a similar amount (92+1%,
n=3) to that found for the native channel (89%). a 10 fold
lower concentration of cremophor (161073% v/v) applied
in the presence of mgatp inhibited the current ¯owing
through dkatp channels by 75+3% (n=6, data not shown),
an amount similar to the inhibition of native katp channels
produced by 261073% v/v cremophor (77%).
to determine if cremophor could aect other members of
the inward-recti®er family, cremophor was tested on kir1.1a
( xxxg1249xxx ). cremophor 0.01% v/v, a dose that produces near
maximal block of katp and dkatp, had no eect on currents
carried by kir1.1a (data not shown): in the presence of
cremophor the slope conductance for kir1.1a was
101+0.24% (n=3) of the control value. the similarity of the
time course and ecacy of the block of dkatp produced by
cremophor to that observed on the native  xxxg1253xxx 
supports the idea that the surfactant acts directly on the
inward-recti®er subunits and not on  xxxg19xxx , furthermore the

block by this surfactant is not shared by the kir1.1a inwardrecti®er subunit.
cremophor is composed of a complex mixture of
hydrophilic (17% wt/wt) and hydrophobic (83% wt/wt)
compounds. the hydrophilic component consists mainly of
glycerin polyglycol ethers (10% wt/wt) and polyglycols (7%
wt/wt). whereas the hydrophobic component consists
predominantly of esters of ricinoleic acid with glycerin
polyglycol ethers and polyglycols, it also contains a little
unreacted ricinoleic acid (3% wt/wt, muller, 1996). it is
possible that one or several of the compounds present in
cremophor account for its inhibition of the k-atp channel.
diacylglcyerols have been shown to block katp channels at
micromolar concentrations (plant, 1989), we therefore tested
if the monoacylglycerol component of cremophor, ricinoleic
acid, can also block  xxxg1253xxx  activity. ricinoleic acid
has an estimated concentration of *10 mm in a 161072%
v/v cremophor solution.
addition of 8 mm ricinoleic acid to that bath blocked wholecell katp currents, recorded with a mgatp-containing pipette
solution, by only 6+4% (n=5), in fact two of these cells failed
to show any response to the fatty acid. ricinoleic acid is
therefore unlikely to be responsible for the majority of the
block of the  xxxg1253xxx  produced by cremophor.
triton x100 (tx100), non-ionic) and tween 80 (tw80,
anionic) are surfactants which, unlike cremophor, have a
more homogeneous composition. they were investigated for
their ability to block native katp, dkatp and kir1.1a-channel
activity. tx100 and tw80 inhibited the current ¯owing
through the  xxxg1253xxx . both tx100 (figure 2c, d) and
tw80 (data not shown) at 161074% v/v blocked currents
¯owing through the dkatp channel irrespective of the presence
of mgatp: dkatp current was blocked 73+2% (n=3) by
tx100 and 87+4% (n=3) by tw80. the recovery of dkatp
from block by these surfactants was also poorly reversible
(figure 2). tx100, at a concentration that completely inhibited
the activity of katp and dkatp (161074% v/v), was without
eect on currents carried by kir1.1a: in the presence of tx100

the slope conductance of kir1.1a was 100+0.1% (n=3) of
control values (data not shown).
figure 3a and b demonstrates that bath application of
either tx100 or tw80 at 161074% v/v, produced a rapid
inhibition of the native whole-cell katp current. at all
concentrations tested, the onset of block produced by tx100
and tw80, like that observed with  xxxd3394xxx , was almost
immediate in onset and was governed by the rate of bath
perfusion, steady-state inhibition being reached within 2 min
of detergent addition.
the dose-dependency of the  xxxg1253xxx  block by tx100
in the absence of mgatp is shown in figure 3c. the best ®t of
equation 1 to this data gave a ki of 261075% v/v (nh=1.6).
this anity for tx100 is *12 fold higher than that ®tted for
cremophor under similar conditions (2.561074%). comparison of the block produced by 161074% v/v tw80 with the
other surfactants suggests that the ki for tw80 is 5161075%
v/v. maximal block of the katp current was observed at
tx100 and tw80 concentrations in excess of 261073% v/v,
values 10 fold lower than that determined for cremophor
under similar conditions (161072% v/v). however, the
maximal amount of inhibition of katp produced by tx100
or tw80 was similar to that produced by cremophor (*80 ±
90%). the inhibition produced by 161074% v/v tw80 or
tx100 was, like that produced by cremophor, unaected by
mgatp.
all three surfactants showed poor reversibility which was
independent of whether mgatp was present or absent. in the
absence of mgatp, a condition in which decay of the katp
current due to rundown is minimized, the katp current
blocked by 161074% v/v tx100 (77% block), 161074%
v/v tw80 (81% block) or 261073% v/v cremophor (75%
block), recovered after 5 min of wash in control solution by
only 48+4% (n=3), 22+14% (n=3) and 30+7% (n=5),
respectively. little further improvement in recovery was seen
after a further 5 min of washing.
surfactants, such as tx100, are known to alter ion
channel function: by decreasing the stiness of the
plasmamembrane they can aect the stability of the dierent
channel states (lundbaek et al., 1996). we therefore studied
the single-channel behaviour of the  xxxg1253xxx  to
investigate whether a similar mechanism could explain the
block of this channel by surfactants (see methods). figure 4
shows representative records of single-channel katp currents
recorded in inside-out patches in control (a) and in the
presence of 161074% v/v cremophor (b), tw80 (c) or
tx100 (d). all three detergents decreased channel activity
(npo) in a dose-dependent manner (figure 4e). the order of
potency of block for 161074% v/v detergent in the excised
patches was tx1004tw804cremophor. in two patches
tested, a 10 min wash in control solution after application of

either tw80 or cremophor recovered npo to only *50%
of control values, this poor reversibility is comparable to the
whole-cell situation.
the single-channel recordings shown in figure 4 clearly
demonstrate that the inhibition of  xxxg1253xxx  activity by the
surfactants was not due to an open-channel rapid block
mechanism, nor a reduction in the single-channel conductance,
because neither the open channel current noise or the singlechannel current amplitude (2 pa, table 1) was aected by the
surfactant.
the kinetic properties of the  xxxg1253xxx  were not
obviously aected by detergent (figure 4 and table 1),
channel openings still occurred both singularly and
clustered within bursts. the failure of the detergents to
aect either the burst length or open-channel lifetime
signi®cantly, indicate that they do not act by an open
channel block mechanism. the lack of an eect of
detergent on the lifetime for gaps within the burst and the
absence of additional fast closed states further indicate that
the inhibition of  xxxg1253xxx  activity by detergent was
not via a ¯ickery, open-channel, block mechanism. the
slowest close-channel lifetime component, tc,4, was signi®cantly lengthened by all three detergents, as was the
proportion of closures that fell into this class (table 1).
trypsin treatment of the intracellular membrane surface has
been demonstrated to increase  xxxg1253xxx  activity and
remove the regulatory aects of  xxxg19xxx  (proks & ashcroft,
1993). after trypsin treatment, the channel is unaected by
sulphonylureas or mgadp. we observed that trypsin
increased  xxxg1253xxx  activity by 350+132% (n=10, data
not shown). however, it did not aect the ability of either
161073% v/v cremophor or 161074% v/v tx100 to inhibit
channel activity: in trypsin-treated patches cremohor blocked
by 76+12% (n=4) and tx100 blocked by 97+1% (n=7)
compared to 70% and 93%, respectively, in untreated patches
(table 1).
to investigate whether detergents aected other types of
k+-channels, they were tested on the voltage-dependent
outward k+ currents (ik(v)) present in the b-cell. ik(v) in the
b-cell is principally carried by  xxxg1237xxx  (roe et al., 1996).
figure 5 illustrates that membrane depolarization to
potentials greater than *40 mv elicits outward k+-currents
which were rapidly and reversibly blocked by 0.01% v/v
cremophor. this concentration of detergent, which inhibits
 xxxg1253xxx  activity by *90%, blocked the peak and the
steady-state ik(v) by 18+5% and 41+5%, respectively
(n=3, figure 5ci). 261073% v/v cremophor, which inhibits
 xxxg1253xxx  activity by *75%, blocked the peak and the
steady-state ik(v) by only 8+2% and 5+5%, respectively
(n=3, data not shown). application of 261073% v/v
tw80, which maximally blocks the  xxxg1253xxx  (490%),

inhibited the peak and the steady-state ik(v) by 27+5% and
43+5%. respectively (n=3, figure 5b and di). comparisons
of the peak current-voltage relationships for ik(v) in control,
in detergent and that of the detergent-sensitive current
(figure 5ci and di), suggest that the inhibition of ik(v) by
detergent is voltage-independent. this idea is also supported
by the percentage block produced by the detergent being
independent of voltage (figure 5ei). the conductancevoltage relationships for the activation of ik(v) in control
and detergent are shown in figure 5cii and dii. there was
no obvious aect of detergent on the voltage-dependence of
activation of ik(v) (figure 5cii and dii). figure 5eii
demonstrates that both cremophor and tw80 enhanced
the inactivation of i-kv. inspection of the whole-cell current
records (figure 5a and b) suggests that the increase in
inactivation by detergent is caused by an acceleration of the
rate of inactivation.
in the intact b-cell, inhibition of the  xxxg1253xxx 
resulted in membrane depolarization and calcium in¯ux.
figure 6 illustrates that in sub-threshold 2.8 mm glucose,
bath application of 10 mm  xxxd3394xxx  elicited a rapid and
reversible rise in intracellular [ca2+]i. subsequent application
of 261073% v/v cremophor, which is expected to block
 xxxg1253xxx  activity by a similar amount to that caused by
10 mm  xxxd3394xxx  (*75%, figure 1), also produced a rise
in intracellular [ca2+]i. removal of cremophor was followed

a

by a slow recovery of the intracellular [ca2+] back to basal
values. addition of 11 mm glucose stimulated a reversible
increase in intracellular [ca2+]. the increases in intracellular
[ca2+] elicited by  xxxd3394xxx , cremophor and glucose were
all associated with an increased root mean square noise in
the ¯uorescence signal (figure 6b): the noise (% ¯uorescence) was 2.4% in control, 5% in  xxxd3394xxx , 8% in
cremophor and 5.2% in glucose. these data are consistent
with ca2+ entry associated with ca2+-dependent action
potential activity elicited by membrane depolarization on
block of katp channels. the ability of glucose to increase
the intracellular [ca2+] con®rms that the cell is a glucoseresponsive b-cell. similar results were obtained in four other
cells.

p&1.08) and triton x100 (mw&628, p&1.1) are homogeneous compounds, conversion of units (% v/v to nm), give a
ki of *350 nm for triton x100 and 5*83 nm for tween 80.
the polydisperse nature of cremophor prevents this calculation (muller, 1996). tween 80 is obviously a very potent
blocker of katp channels.
the hill coecients varied slightly between the dierent
surfactants. the low hill coecient of cremophor (*0.6)
may be explained if the detergent undergoes self association
in aqueous solution and exists predominantly as a dimer
(kessel, 1992). if the dimer cannot block the channel but
one or both of its constituent parts can, cremophor would
need to dissociate before it could inhibit the  xxxg1253xxx ,
thereby producing the observed square root dependency
(nh=0.5) of detergent concentration to block the channel.
the high hill coecient of triton x100 (*1.6) has several
possible explanations: (1) at least two molecules of detergent
must bind to the channel to inhibit its activity. (2) triton
x100 associates in the media and then binds as a dimer. (3)
triton x100 has a high level of positive cooperativity,
binding of one detergent molecule favouring further binding
before block ensues.

the block of katp by detergent is independent of
mgatp
the ability of the detergents to block irrespective of the
presence of mgatp supports the notion that the reduction in
katp current produced by the detergents is due to a direct
block of the channel and is not due to an acceleration of
channel rundown. the ability of the detergents to block in the
absence of atp show that they do not inhibit the  xxxg1253xxx 
by increasing its sensitivity to atp.

the block of katp is mediated via  xxxg1250xxx  and does not
involve  xxxg19xxx 
the ability of the detergents to block dkatp, in the absence of
 xxxg19xxx , by a comparable amount to the native channel, strongly
supports the idea that the surfactants do not act through  xxxg19xxx 

effects of detergents on katp channels

but act directly on the  xxxg1250xxx  pore subunit. the observation
that trypsin treatment of the inner membrane surface appears
to uncouple  xxxg19xxx  from  xxxg1250xxx  (proks & ashcroft, 1993) but
has no eect on the ability of detergents to inhibit katp
supports a lack of involvement of  xxxg19xxx . furthermore, the
failure of detergent to block currents ¯owing through inwardrecti®er channels composed solely of kir1.1a pore-subunits
suggest that  xxxg1250xxx  has a speci®c detergent-sensitive site that is
absent from kir1.1a. the eect of detergent on the behaviour
of the  xxxg1253xxx  can be explained by it either binding
directly to this site or acting indirectly though alterations in the
interactions between the  xxxg1250xxx  pore subunit and its membrane
lipid-environment e.g. annular lipids. if the topology of the
octameric model proposed for the quartenary structure of the
 xxxg1253xxx  by clement et al. (1997) is correct, namely four
 xxxg19xxx  molecules forming a ring around the channel pore,
eectively shielding the  xxxg1250xxx  subunits from the membrane
environment, then the model of a direct action of detergent on
 xxxg1250xxx  is favoured. the slow rate of reversal of the block of the
 xxxg1253xxx  produced by the dierent detergents are entirely
consistent with their nanomolar anities.

mechanism of the block of katp channels by detergent
single-channel analysis of the kinetics of the  xxxg1253xxx 
suggests all the surfactants tested act as slow channel blockers
(smith et al., 1994), promoting or stabilizing closed state/s that
proceed those that are involved in the open-channel burst
behaviour. this is manifest as a reduction in npo, with little or
no eect on the kinetic behaviour of the channel during a
burst, but causing elongation of the longest closures between
bursts. a decrease in npo would increase both the length and
proportion of periods during which channel openings are
absent, i.e. increasing the likelihood of the longest close time
component, tc,4.
the similar potency of block of the  xxxg1253xxx  in excised
patch and whole-cell, for which the holding potentials dier by
*70 mv, indicates that the block produced by detergent is
voltage-independent, also supported by the ®nding that the
block of the cloned channels by detergent is independent of the
ramp voltage. the high anity of block of the  xxxg1253xxx 
produced by tween 80 (ki583 nm) is more consistent with a
pharmacological rather than physicochemical action of this
detergent on the  xxxg1253xxx .

block of ik(v) by detergents
the mechanism of block of ik(v) produced by cremophor and
tw80 clearly diers to that of  xxxg1253xxx  being of a far
lower potency and easily reversible, the latter consistent with
their low anity. moreover, the detergents appear to act by
causing an acceleration of inactivation and not by a tonic
block. a similar phenomenon has been described for tx100
on the cloned voltage-gated k-channel,  xxxg1237xxx  (hoèllerer &
heinemann, 1996). the molecular identity of the voltage-gated
k-channels which underlie the bulk of ik(v) in the pancreatic bcell have been shown to be  xxxg1237xxx  (roe et al., 1996). although,
under certain experimental conditions, k+ ¯ux through large
ca2+-activated k+-channels may contribute to the outward
k+-current (ashcroft & rorsman, 1989), the absence of both
a voltage-dependent biphasic activation of the whole-cell
current and a bell-shaped hump in the current-voltage
relationship of ik(v), suggest that these channels were not very
active in this study and ik(v) is indeed carried mainly by  xxxg1237xxx .
whether cremophor and tw80 block ik(v) in b-cells by a
similar mechanism to that proposed for the action of tx100

538

p.a. smith & p. proks

on  xxxg1237xxx  by hoèllerer and heinemann (1996), namely a
lowering of the energy barrier between the resting channel and
its c-type inactivated conformation promoting inactivation, is
unknown.

comparison of detergent eects on mdr
from this study it appears that any similarities in the
pharmacology of p-glycoprotein and katp channels are
unlikely to be achieved by the channel protein containing a
structural homologue of p-glycoprotein:  xxxg19xxx . instead it
appears that the channel pore-subunit itself,  xxxg1250xxx , may
possess a lipophilic binding site. other lipophilic compounds
have already been shown to block directly the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit,
e.g.  xxxd2914xxx  on dkatp (proks & ashcroft, 1997).  xxxg1250xxx 
is not unique in the possession of a modulatory lipophilic
binding site/s, since other ion channels, e.g. the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor, have also been described that are
modulated by lipophilic signalling molecules (barrentes, 1993).
it is tempting to speculate that the putative lipophilic binding
site on  xxxg1250xxx  proposed in this study may be an alternative
route by which b-cell metabolism could eect the activity of
the  xxxg1253xxx  and insulin secretion.

physiological consequences of detergent
expectedly, low doses of cremophor can depolarize the b-cell
and elicit ca2+ entry. similar eects were observed with low
doses of tx100 and tw80 (data not shown). furthermore, we
have demonstrated that in intact cells this eect is reversible
and does not appear to destroy normal b-cell function;
therefore ruling out the general disruption of the membrane
by low doses of detergent. the increase in intracellular ca2+
produced by the detergents are comparable to those produced
by other insulin secretagogues, namely glucose and tolbuta-

effects of detergents on katp channels

mide. therefore it is possible that plasma borne detergent, at a
sucient concentration, may elevate levels of circulating
insulin. whether this is the case is not known.
plasma measurements of cremophor in patients receiving
the surfactant, either as a vehicle for lipophilic drugs or as a
therapy for cancer, are typically around 0.1% v/v (webster et
al., 1993; buckingham et al., 1996). assuming 99% of this is
bound to plasma protein, the free concentration is estimated to
be 161073% v/v (webster et al., 1993), a concentration well in
excess of the ki for block (361075% v/v) of  xxxg1253xxx 
activity. it is interesting to speculate about the clinical and
pathological impact of detergents in our environment on
physiological process which involve katp channels composed
of  xxxg1250xxx . for example both tween 80 and cremophor have
been found to stimulate smooth muscle contraction in aortic
rings at concentrations as low as those employed here
(161074% v/v for tween 80 and 161073% v/v for
cremophor, zengil et al., 1995). it is conceivable that these
eects may simply be due to detergent-mediated inhibition of
katp channels in the smooth muscle.

conclusion
in conclusion we have demonstrated that surfactants are
potent blockers of the  xxxg1253xxx  and appear to act via the
 xxxg1250xxx  pore-subunit. the concentrations of unbound surfactant in the plasma of patients receiving drug administrations
which contain detergent are expected to aect the activity of
katp channels and associated physiological functions.
