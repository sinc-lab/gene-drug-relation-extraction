mutations within the abl kinase domain and overexpression of src family kinases have
been identified among the known mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid
leukemia (cml). the development of agents with dual inhibitory activity against src and
abl kinases is one approach to overcome imatinib resistance. one such agent,  xxxd1815xxx 
(formerly  xxxd1815xxx ), is approximately 300-fold more potent against bcr–abl than
imatinib, and is active against all tested abl mutant isoforms, except for t315i.  xxxd1815xxx  has
demonstrated high efficacy in phase i and ii studies in patients with cml following failure of
imatinib therapy. studies exploring the efficacy of  xxxd1815xxx  as front-line therapy in patients
with bcr–abl-expressing hematologic malignancies are underway.

the incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia
(cml) is low worldwide. in the usa, approximately 34,810 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in the year 2005, of which 4600
corresponded to patients with cml. hence, cml
represents 14% of all cases of leukemia and 20% of
those diagnosed in adult patients. the annual incidence of cml is 1.6 cases per 100,000 adults [1],
with a slight male preponderance (male:female
ratio 1.4:1). however, with the annual mortality
now reduced to 1–2% with  xxxd2333xxx 
therapy, the prevalence of cml in the usa, if the
current results remain as favorable, will peak at a
level of 250,000 patients, which will make cml a
common indolent leukemia. cml is exceedingly
rare in children; the median age of patients at diagnosis is 65 years. neither chemical exposure nor
genetic predisposition play a role in the development of cml, although there is an increased frequency in individuals with heavy exposure to
radiation [2].
cml has been classically described as a triphasic disease. approximately 90% of patients
with cml are diagnosed in a chronic phase (cp).
untreated patients in cp inevitably progress to a
blast phase (bp) after a median of 3–5 years, frequently preceded by an accelerated phase (ap) [3].
the estimated risk of transformation to bp is
5–10% per year during the first 2 years after diagnosis, but the annual progression rate increases to
up to 20–25% thereafter [3,4]. the introduction of
small molecules, such as  xxxd2333xxx , targeting the kinase activity of the bcr–abl kinase has
redefined the treatment of cml. a second generation of these compounds has reached advanced
stages of clinical development. the preclinical and
clinical development of  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ®;
 xxxd1815xxx ) is discussed in this review.

pathogenesis of cml

the diagnosis of cml is based upon the detection of the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation,
known as the philadelphia (ph) chromosome [5,6].
this juxtaposes two genes, abl, which encodes
a protein with  xxxg2198xxx  activity, and bcr,
which encodes a protein with serine kinase activity. the result is a fusion gene, bcr–abl,
which, upon translation, gives rise to a fusion
protein with increased  xxxg2198xxx  activity.
typically, the breakpoint in bcr occurs in the
major  xxxg256xxx  (m-bcr). the
resultant mrna is translated into a 210-kd protein (p210bcr–abl) [7]. alternatively, breakpoints may occur in a more centromeric area,
known as the minor  xxxg256xxx 
(m-bcr); this produces a smaller protein product (p185bcr–abl). rarely, the breakpoint is
in a more telomeric region termed µ-bcr; this
gives rise to the product p230bcr–abl [7].
regardless of the breakpoint, the increased  xxxg2198xxx  activity of bcr–abl results in autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of a
number of downstream pathways, including ras,
c-myc, phosphatidylionositol 3-kinase (pi3k)
and others. the final result is increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, altered adhesion to
the stroma and disruption of genetic stability,
which leads to the leukemic phenotype.
imatinib therapy & resistance

the use of interferon (ifn)-alpha in cml has been
associated with a complete hematologic response
(chr) rate of 80% and a complete cytogenetic
response (ccgr; 0% ph-positive cells) rate of
up to 30% [8].  xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec™) is
an orally bioavailable 2-phenylaminopyrimidine
with targeted inhibitory activity against the

constitutively active abl  xxxg2198xxx , with
50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 µm [9–11]. in the phase iii,
international randomized study of interferon
and sti571 (iris) trial, the efficacy of imatinib
was compared with the combination of  xxxg1137xxx 
and low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  in patients with newly
diagnosed cml in cp [12]. after a median followup of 60 months, the projected chr and ccgr
rates were 98 and 87%, respectively [13]. the estimated 5-year survival rate was approximately
90%. based on these results, imatinib has become
the standard front-line therapy for cml. however, a subset of patients with cml exhibit either
primary or secondary resistance to imatinib.
approximately 2–4% of patients with cp cml
treated with imatinib develop resistance every
year, for the first 3 years after start of therapy,
due, in half of them, to point mutations in the
abl  xxxg2198xxx  domain. more than
30 different bcr–abl point mutations have
been reported [14], conferring varying degrees of
insensitivity to imatinib [15]. the most frequent
mutations are those that map to the p-loop
region of the kinase domain, which serves as a
docking site for atp [15–17]. other reported
mechanisms of resistance include overexpression
or amplification of bcr–abl or its protein product, disruption of the transport of imatinib into
the cells or increased transport out of the cells, and
bcr–abl-independent mechanisms such as the
overexpression of src-related kinases. several
strategies are being investigated to overcome imatinib resistance, including the development of
novel  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors with enhanced
activity against bcr–abl compared with imatinib and/or with inhibitory activity against other
kinases that modulate downstream bcr–abl
signaling pathways.
molecular targets in cml

several biological models, such as retrovirally
transduced bcr–abl-positive mouse cells [18] and
bcr–abl-expressing cd34+ cells in culture
[19,20], have demonstrated that deregulated abl
 xxxg2198xxx  activity is critical in the pathogenesis of cml. distinct pathways involving a host of
 xxxg2198xxx  proteins are activated in
bcr–abl-expressing cells [21]. phosphorylation at
the y177 site of bcr is essential for bcr–abl
leukemogenesis [22,23]. this residue constitutes a
high-affinity docking site for the src homology
(sh)2 domain of growth factor receptor-bound
protein (grb)2. in turn, grb2 recruits sos (a
guanine nucleotide exchanger of ras) and the
656

scaffold adapter grb2-associated binding protein (gab)2 through its sh3 domain. phosphorylation of gab2 leads to recruitment of pi3k
and src homology-containing  xxxd1075xxx 
phosphatase (shp)2 (also known as  xxxg1894xxx ),
whereas sos activates ras [24]. the importance of
the y177 residue in bcr–abl signaling is highlighted by the fact that mutation of y177 to phenylalanine (y177f) largely abolishes grb2
binding and abrogates bcr–abl-induced ras
activation [22]. in a stem cell transplantation model
of cml, bcr–ably177f has a greatly reduced
ability to induce a myeloproliferative disorder in
mice [25]. of note,  xxxg1894xxx  is required for normal
activation of the ras–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway that most receptor
tyrosine kinases signal through [24]. bcr–abl
also phosphorylates the src kinases lyn,  xxxg1028xxx 
and fgr. once phosphorylated,  xxxg1028xxx  activates
signal transducer and activator of transcription
(stat)5 [26,27]. therefore, bcr–abl promotes
hematopoietic cell transformation mainly through
ras, pi3k and  xxxg2216xxx  activation. all these elements have been shown to upregulate the expression of  xxxg366xxx , thus inducing cell cycle
progression from g1 to s phase [28,29].
src: a target for cml therapy

src kinases form a family of nine structurally
homologous nonreceptor intracellular tyrosine
kinases (src, fyn, yes, blk, yrk, fgr,  xxxg1028xxx ,
lck and lyn) that regulate signal transduction
pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation
and survival [30]. the expression of some src
kinases is ubiquitous; others display different tissue-specific expression patterns. for instance,
 xxxg1028xxx , lyn, fgr, lck and blk are strictly
restricted to hematopoietic cells [30]. furthermore,
 xxxg1028xxx  expression is strictly circumscribed to myeloid cells and b-lymphocytes, whereas lyn is
expressed in myeloid cells, b-lymphocytes and natural killer cells [30]. multiple domains of bcr–abl
interact with  xxxg1028xxx  and lyn, leading to their activation. experiments with src dominant-negative mutants suggest that src kinases play a role
in proliferation of bcr–abl-expressing cell
lines [30–32]. neither the formation of the
 xxxg1028xxx –bcr–abl complex nor the bcr–ablmediated activation of  xxxg1028xxx  are dependent on the
abl kinase activity [33]. overexpression of src
kinases has been implicated in bcr–abl-mediated leukemogenesis and, in some cases, of imatinib resistance [34–37]. paired samples from patients
with cml obtained before and after imatinib failure suggest that overexpression and/or activation of
future oncol. (2006) 2(6)

 xxxd1815xxx  – drug

 xxxg1028xxx  and lyn occurs during cml progression
to bp, indicating that acquired imatinib resistance may be, at least in part, bcr–ablindependent and mediated by overexpression of
src kinases [35]. activation of src kinases may
promote phosphorylation of bcr–abl and
interaction with grb2 [32,33]. interestingly, it has
been demonstrated that  xxxg1028xxx  phosphorylates the
activation loop of abl kinase in vitro and blocks
the binding of imatinib [38]. abl has significant
sequence homology with src and, in its active
configuration, bears a remarkable structural
resemblance with src family kinases. not surprisingly, atp-competitive compounds originally
developed as src inhibitors frequently exert
potent inhibition of abl kinase due to the striking resemblance between the catalytically active
state of both protein kinases [39]. based on the
structural similarity between abl and src, and
their critical role in the pathogenesis of cml,
small-molecule inhibitors with overlapping activity against both abl and src may result in
enhanced activity against cml compared with
that of imatinib, a potent abl  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor, but with negligible activity against src
kinases. this may be at least partially due to the
fact that in the inactive configuration, the only
one to which imatinib can bind, abl is much less
structurally similar to src.
preclinical development of  xxxd1815xxx 

a series of substituted 2-(aminopyridyl)- and
2-(aminopyrimidinyl)thiazole-5-carboxamides,
initially developed as immunosuppressant drugs,
were identified as potent dual src and abl
kinase inhibitors [40].  xxxd1815xxx , n-(2-chloro-6methylphenyl)-2-(6-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl)-2-methylpyrimidin-4-lamino)
thiazole-5-carboxamide), was selected for further
in vivo studies based on its modest plasma protein binding and sustained blood levels in 4-h
exposure studies (figure 1) [40]. the 3d co-crystal

structure of  xxxd1815xxx  complexed with the abl
kinase revealed the presence of two hydrogen
bonds at the hinge region of the atp-binding site
involving the residue met318, and one hydrogen
bond between the hydroxyl oxygen of thr315 and
the amide nitrogen of  xxxd1815xxx  [40,41]. in this
model, similar bonds were observed between
 xxxd1815xxx  and src kinase, with the addition of
another hydrogen bond between  xxxd1815xxx  and the
src residue lys295 [40].  xxxd1815xxx  effectively
inhibited several src family kinases including
src (ic50 0.55 nm), lck (ic50 1.1 nm), fyn
(ic50 0.2 nm) and yes (ic50 0.41 nm). in addition,  xxxd1815xxx  was a highly potent atp competitive inhibitor of abl (ic50 <1 nm), c-kit (ic50
13 nm),  xxxg1710xxx 
(ic50 28 nm), ephrin a2 (ic50 17 nm), and
showed some activity against  xxxg682xxx  (ic50 80 nm)
and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases
(ic50 100 nm) [40,42]. owing to its less stringent
binding requirements,  xxxd1815xxx  binds both the
active and inactive conformations of the abl
kinase. a possible consequence of the inhibition
of the src family kinases is that  xxxd1815xxx  also
inhibits the proliferation of solid tumor cell lines
such as pc-3 (prostate; ic50 5–9 nm), mdamb-211 (breast; ic50 10–12 nm), widr (colon;
ic50 38–52 nm) and h69 and h526 (small cell
lung cancer) in vitro and/or in tumor xenograft
models, supporting the development of  xxxd1815xxx 
for the treatment of solid tumors [40,42].
pharmacokinetics in a rat model identified
 xxxd1815xxx  as having a high volume of distribution
(vss 6.3 l/kg) with systemic clearance of approximately 40% of hepatic blood flow. a 10 mg/kg
oral dose was rapidly absorbed and demonstrated
a half-life of 3.1 h and a measured oral bioavailability of 27%. the in vivo activity of  xxxd1815xxx 
was evaluated in a k562 xenograft model of
cml, demonstrating complete tumor regressions and low toxicity at doses ranging from 5 to
50 mg/kg in a 5-day on, 2-day off schedule,
without apparent toxicity [40].
in cellular assays,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the proliferation of bcr–abl-transfected ba/f3 cells and
human bcr–abl-expressing k562 cells with
ic50 values of 1.3 and less than 1 nm, respectively,
and demonstrated high potency against 14 of 15
clinically relevant imatinib-resistant abl mutant
isoforms [15,42,43], supporting the less stringent conformational requirements of  xxxd1815xxx  on abl for
kinase inhibition compared with imatinib (figure 2)
[43]. of note, t315i retained kinase activity even in
the presence of micromolar concentrations of
 xxxd1815xxx , suggesting that this residue acts as a
657

gatekeeper for atp-competitive small-molecule
kinase inhibitors. in a model of imatinib-resistant,
bcr–abl-mediated disease, severe combined
immunodeficient mice were injected intravenously
with ba/f3 cells expressing different bcr–abl
isoforms as well as the firefly luciferase gene.
administration of  xxxd1815xxx  (10 mg/kg twice daily)
by gavage for 2 weeks resulted in mice displaying
greater than 1-log lower levels of bioluminescent
activity and prolonged survival compared with
untreated controls. mice harboring t315i did not
respond to  xxxd1815xxx . notably,  xxxd1815xxx  markedly
inhibited the growth of bone marrow progenitors
isolated from patients with cml harboring imatinib-sensitive or -resistant (m351t) disease, but
not marrow progenitors obtained from healthy
volunteers [43]. in a saturation mutagenesis screening, significantly fewer mutations were induced
with  xxxd1815xxx  compared with imatinib. still, ten
bcr–abl mutants were generated, the most frequent being f317v>t315a>t315i>f317l. all
of these mutants represent points of contact
between  xxxd1815xxx  and the abl kinase. these
mutants could potentially account for clinical
resistance to  xxxd1815xxx  in clinical practice. in fact,
instances of  xxxd1815xxx  failure associated with one of

these mutations, t315a, have been described [44].
however, despite reduced activity against these
mutants, the ic50 values for  xxxd1815xxx  against eight
of these mutants (excluding t315a and t315i)
are less than 53 nm. the clinical significance of
these in vitro findings is still to be defined. of
note, the combination of  xxxd1815xxx  with imatinib
greatly reduced the recovery of drug-resistant
clones (figure 3) [44]. similar results were observed
in another cell-line-based mutagenesis assay [45].
only approximately 5–15% of patients
treated with imatinib at standard doses achieve a
complete molecular response (i.e., undetectable
bcr–abl transcript levels) [46]. the persistence
of residual disease in most patients has been
associated with persistence of primitive leukemic progenitors [27]. bcr–abl-expressing
cd34+/lin- leukemic stem cells of patients with
cp cml remained viable in a quiescent state in
the presence of growth factors and imatinib [47],
suggesting the possibility of relapse even after
prolonged exposure to imatinib [48]. although
 xxxd1815xxx  is significantly more potent than imatinib within the cml stem cell compartment,
some quiescent stem cells survive, suggesting
that this population may be innately insensitive,

at least to some extent, to both agents [49]. moreover, several imatinib-resistant abl kinase
domain mutations have been detected in
cd34+/bcr–abl+ progenitors [50], and the
activity of both imatinib and  xxxd1815xxx  against
k562 cells forced into quiescence by nutrient
depletion is approximately tenfold lower than
against proliferating k562 cells [51]. interestingly,
studies in quiescent k562 cultures and in
murine k562 xenografts demonstrated that the
combination of  xxxd1815xxx  and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor bms-214662 produced supraadditive cytotoxicity at clinically achievable
concentrations [51].
it has been reported that therapy with imatinib in patients with cml results in significantly
lower percentages of cd4+ t cells that synthesize interleukin (il)-2,  xxxg1141xxx  and tumor necrosis
factor (tnf)-alpha than the activated t cells of control subjects, which translates into decreased
t-cell proliferation in vitro [52]. of note, no
effects were observed on the ability of activated
t cells, obtained from patients with cp cml
during  xxxd1815xxx  treatment, to synthesize il-2,
il-10,  xxxg1141xxx  or tnf-alpha cytokines, despite the
potent activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against src family
kinases [53].

clinical development of  xxxd1815xxx  in
imatinib-resistant cml

 xxxd1815xxx  was first investigated in a phase i doseescalation study involving patients with cml in
all phases who had failed or developed intolerance to imatinib therapy (table 1) [54]. in patients
with cp cml, which was the first cohort investigated,  xxxd1815xxx  was administered either as single or divided oral doses of 15–180 mg for
5 days followed by a 2-day break every week.
within 2 h of oral administration of the higher
doses, plasma concentrations in the range of
100–200 nm were achieved; the terminal halflife was approximately 5 h [55]. recently, results
from this phase i study of  xxxd1815xxx  have been
reported in patients with cml in all phases
resistant or intolerant to imatinib or with
ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ph+ all) [54]. a total of 84 patients (40 with
cml cp, 11 with cml ap, 23 with cml in
myeloid bp, and 10 with ph+ all) received
 xxxd1815xxx  (15–240 mg daily) in 4-week cycles. a
chr was achieved in 37 (92%) patients with
cml cp and a major cytogenetic response in 18
(45%), including a ccgr in 14 (35%). major
hematologic responses were observed in 31
(70%) of 44 patients with cml ap, bp or

ph+ all, and major cytogenetic (cg)
responses (ph-positivity <35%) were achieved
in 27, 35 and 80% of patients in cml ap, bp,
and ph+ all, respectively. responses were
maintained in 95% of patients with cml cp
and in 82% of patients with cml ap after a
median follow-up of more than 12 and
5 months, respectively. however, only one
(10%) patient with ph+ all remained relapsefree after a median follow-up of 4 months [54].
overall,  xxxd1815xxx  therapy was well tolerated.
the most frequently encountered toxicities
were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal and
fluid retention syndromes. grade 3–4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was observed in 45
and 35% of patients with cml cp and in 89
and 80% of those with ap, bp, or ph+ all,
respectively. diarrhea occurred in 23% of
patients, but was grade 1–2 in all but one
patient. nonmalignant pleural effusions
affected 15 patients, likely related to  xxxd1815xxx 
therapy, most frequently grade 1 or 2 and manageable, and grade 1–2 peripheral edema was
observed in 16 (19%) patients. in this phase i
study, 60 (71%) of 84 patients presented with
bcr–abl mutations at baseline. chr and
cg responses were observed across all
mutations, except in 4 patients harboring the
t315i mutant bcr–abl isoform, including
1 patient who developed this mutation while
receiving  xxxd1815xxx .
results from a series of open-label phase ii
studies of  xxxd1815xxx  in patients with cml in all
phases who had failed or become intolerant to
imatinib, have recently been reported (table 1). in
these studies,  xxxd1815xxx  was administered at a
dose of 70 mg twice daily, based on pharmacokinetic data and optimal inhibition of bcr–abl
660

and src activity [55]. in one study, involving
exclusively patients with cml in cp,
387 patients resistant (75%) or intolerant
(25%) to imatinib with a median age of
58 years (range: 21–85 years) were treated [56].
a chr was observed in 90% of patients and
major cg response was reported in 78% of
imatinib-intolerant (68% ccgr and 10%
cgpr) and in 42% of imatinib-resistant (30%
ccgr and 12% cgpr) patients. bcr–abl
mutations were detected in 160 (44%) of 363
assessable patients, the most frequently encountered mutation being g250e (n = 23), and
t315i (n = 3), respectively. significant molecular responses were not observed until after
6 months of  xxxd1815xxx  therapy, with a median
bcr–abl/abl ratio of 0.3% at 9 months [56].
the 10-month progression-free survival rate
was 88%. the most common nonhematologic
toxicities were diarrhea (32%), headache
(30%), rash (22%), superficial edema (20%)
and pleural effusion (17%). grade 3–4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia were reported in
47% of patients each [56].
a total of 174 patients with cml ap were
treated with  xxxd1815xxx  in another phase ii
study [57]. a total of 91 (52%) patients had
failed imatinib therapy at doses equal or
higher than 600 mg daily. the median duration of  xxxd1815xxx  therapy was 7 months
(range: 0.13–13) and the average daily  xxxd1815xxx  dose was 113 mg (range: 24–192).  xxxd1815xxx  dose was reduced in 53% and escalated in
46% of patients, respectively, and 63 (36%)
patients eventually discontinued  xxxd1815xxx 
owing to progression (n = 27), toxicity (n = 10)
or death (n = 10). a major hematologic
response was reported in 102 (59%) patients,
future oncol. (2006) 2(6)

 xxxd1815xxx  – drug

including 59 (34%) patients who achieved
chr and 43 (25%) with no evidence of leukemia (nel). a major cg response was attained
in 60 (34%) patients, including 43 (25%) and
17 (10%) patients who had ccgr and cgpr,
respectively. major cg response was noted in
34 (36%) of 94 patients harboring bcr–abl
mutations. the majority of patients (97%)
experienced some degree of cytopenias,
although 18 and 45% of patients entered the
study with baseline neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. the most common
nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea (61%)
and rash (27%). pleural effusion was observed
in 43 (25%) patients and managed with diuretics
and/or pulse steroids [57].
preliminary data after a minimum follow-up
of 6 months has recently been presented on
109 patients with cml myeloid bp [58] and on
94 patients with either cml lymphoid bp
(n = 48) or ph+ all (n = 46) [59]. a total of 91%
of patients were resistant to imatinib in each
group and the proportion of patients who had
failed imatinib therapy at doses equal or higher
than 600 mg daily were 50, 52 and 46% in myeloid bp, lymphoid bp and ph+ all, respectively.
the overall hematologic and cytogenetic response
rates among patients with myeloid bp were 48%
(49% for imatinib-resistant and 40% for imatinib-intolerant) and 44% (ccgr 25%, cgpr
6%, minor/minimal cytogenetic response 13%),
respectively. major hematologic responses were
observed in 33% (chr 29% and nel 4%) of
patients with lymphoid bp and in 39% (chr
33% and nel 7%) among those with ph+ all,
and major cg response were reported in 44%
(ccgr 38%) of patients with lymphoid bp and
in 46% (ccgr 44%) of those with ph+ all.
 xxxd1815xxx  therapy was frequently associated with
myelosuppression, although this was pre-existing
in a substantial proportion of patients. grade 3–4
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was observed
in 64% (18% at baseline) and 64% (43% at baseline) of patients with cml in myeloid bp and in
81/74% (48/20% at baseline) and 88/78%
(67/48% at baseline) in those with lymphoid
bp/ph+ all, respectively. the most frequent
nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea
(30–37%), nausea (18–22%) and vomiting
(17–20%), which were generally grade 1–2 and
manageable. pleural effusion was observed in
30% (grade 3–4 in 13%) of patients receiving
 xxxd1815xxx  in myeloid bp and in 16% (grade 3–4
in 4%) of patients with lymphoid bp/ph+
all [54,59].

evaluation

in summary, the results from the phase i and ii
studies demonstrate significant clinical activity of
 xxxd1815xxx  in all stages of cml. responses have
been durable with present follow-up, particularly
among patients treated in cp and ap, and
responses were observed across a wide range of
mutations, except t315i, confirming the results
obtained in vitro. overall,  xxxd1815xxx  was well tolerated. myelosuppression occurs particularly in
ap and bp. in most instances, myelosuppression is
transient and reversible with dose adjustments.
most nonhematologic adverse events are mild and
manageable. fluid retention has received significant attention, particularly in the form of pleural
effusion. this is more common (20–30%) in bp
than in earlier stages (10–15% in cp) and is frequently mild, with grade 3–4 cases present in only
3–5% in cp and 10–15% in bp. this can usually
be managed with treatment interruptions and the
use of diuretics and corticosteroids. only occasionally does it require thoracentesis and it rarely
results in permanent treatment discontinuation.
recently, results of a randomized, multinational, open-label phase ii study comparing the
activity of  xxxd1815xxx  and high-dose imatinib have
been reported [60]. the analysis was based on data
from 150 patients with resistance to imatinib less
or equal to 600 mg daily, randomized 2:1 to
receive  xxxd1815xxx  70 mg twice daily or imatinib
400 mg twice daily. crossover was allowed for
progression, lack of response or intolerance. after
a follow-up of 3 months, major cg response was
achieved in 35% (ccgr 21% and cgpr 14%)
of patients in the  xxxd1815xxx  arm and in 29%
(ccgr 8% and cgpr 21%) in the high-dose
imatinib arm. in addition, 15% of patients in the
 xxxd1815xxx  arm and 76% in the imatinib arm
experienced progression or crossed over due to
intolerance. interestingly, among 19 patients who
crossed over to  xxxd1815xxx  therapy, 42% achieved
major cg response. by contrast, none of the four
patients who crossed over to the imatinib arm
achieved a major cg response. weight gain,
muscle cramps and general fluid retention were
more common with high-dose imatinib. myelosuppression was more frequent with  xxxd1815xxx .
there were no significant differences in other toxicities, except for the occurrence of pleural effusion
in 11% of patients treated with  xxxd1815xxx  [60].
dynamics of molecular response
to  xxxd1815xxx 

molecular analysis of imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients (19 in cp and 14 with advanced disease [ap, bp and ph+ all]) treated at university

drug evaluation – quintás-cardama, kantarjian & cortes

of california, los angeles (ucla), ca, usa, in
the phase i dose-escalation trial of  xxxd1815xxx 
showed that six (43%) of 14 patients in ap and
seven (37%) of 19 patients in cp achieved equal
to or greater than 2-log reductions, including
four patients in each group who had a major
molecular response (mmr; i.e., bcr–abl/abl
ratio <0.05%) as measured by quantitative pcr.
responses were maintained in two of six patients
with advanced disease and six of seven patients
in cp achieving equal to or greater than 2-log
reductions. mutations were detected at last analysis in all 23 patients with baseline mutations.
the same mutation present at baseline was
present in 21 patients, and five had an additional
mutation. mutations were present in all patients
who progressed (one cp and seven ap/bc), and
it was t315i in six of them. t315i evolved in
three other patients who have not progressed
(one cp and two ap/bc), making this mutant
the most frequently detected during  xxxd1815xxx 
therapy. t315i mutation was accompanied by
significant increments in bcr–abl transcripts
in all patients [61].
an analysis of the dynamics of molecular
response to  xxxd1815xxx  has recently been
reported [62]. a total of 54 patients (cp: 29
[55%], ap: 14 [26%], bp: 10 [19%]) received
 xxxd1815xxx  at 140 mg daily (n = 49) or at 100 mg
daily (n = 4) in phase ii studies for a median of
36 weeks (range: 11–73). patients in cp had a

baseline median bcr–abl/abl ratio of
68.99%. after 1 month of therapy, there was
an increase in bcr–abl transcript levels,
reaching a median value of 99%. however, by
2 months a significant decrease in the
bcr–abl transcript level was observed, with a
median value of 11.64%. by 9 months, the
median value had decreased to 0.12%. by contrast, patients with advanced-phase cml
(baseline bcr–abl/abl ratio of 100%)
experienced a steady decline in transcript levels
from the start of  xxxd1815xxx  therapy, but the
decline was slower and less pronounced than
that observed in cp. the lowest median pcr
value achieved by this group of patients was
observed at 9 months (0.94%). at this time
point, the median bcr–abl transcript level
reached by these patients was similar to that
achieved by patients in cp at 6 months
(0.99%). in addition, by 12 months, the
median pcr value had more than tripled the
median levels at 9 months (3.98%). ten
patients achieved at least a mmr by quantitative real-time pcr. three of these patients
have achieved undetectable bcr–abl levels,
considered a complete molecular response. all
ten patients who achieved a mmr were in cp
at the start of  xxxd1815xxx  therapy, and three of
five evaluated had an abl kinase domain
mutation at the start of therapy. no t315i
mutations were observed in this study [62].

executive summary
chronic myeloid leukemia
• approximately 5000 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) are diagnosed each year in the usa.
• imatinib therapy is associated with complete cytogenetic response rates of 80–90% in early chronic phase.
• imatinib is inactive against several abl kinase domain mutations, fails to eradicate primitive quiescent bcr–abl-expressing
progenitor cells, and induces complete molecular responses in a small percentage of patients.
src family kinases as targets for cml therapy
• bcr-abl activates src kinases both through phosphorylation and direct binding.
• patients with advanced-stage cml who progress on imatinib therapy have been found to overexpress certain src family kinases,
supporting their possible role in cml progression and promotion of resistance.
 xxxd1815xxx 
•  xxxd1815xxx  is an atp-competitive, dual src/abl kinase inhibitor that is 300-fold more active against bcr-abl than imatinib.
•  xxxd1815xxx  has demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of abl kinase mutants, except t315i.
• preliminary results from phase ii studies in patients who had previously failed imatinib demonstrated that  xxxd1815xxx  therapy has
been associated with complete hematological responses in 90% and cytogenetic responses in over 45% of patients in chronic
phase, and significant activity in patients with advanced-stage cml.
•  xxxd1815xxx  was generally well tolerated, the most common side effects being neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal.
• the potential role of  xxxd1815xxx  as front-line therapy in cml is currently being investigated.

future perspective

despite the excellent results obtained with
imatinib, there is a need to improve therapy in
cml. the remarkable response rates obtained
with  xxxd1815xxx  in patients with cml in the
post-imatinib failure setting have prompted
several ongoing clinical trials to address the
activity of this dual src/abl inhibitor in
newly diagnosed cml. there are important
questions regarding the optimal use of  xxxd1815xxx 
in cml, such as the correct  xxxd1815xxx  dose
schedule (daily vs twice daily, 100 vs 140 mg
daily) which may maximize cytogenetic and
molecular responses with optimal tolerability

and safety. an extended follow-up of patients on
 xxxd1815xxx  therapy will provide invaluable information to accurately define the incidence and
durability of molecular responses and dasatinibassociated long-term toxicity. it remains uncertain whether the in vitro activity of  xxxd1815xxx 
observed against primitive quiescent leukemic
cells will translate into improved and more durable response rates in cml, particularly in the
front-line setting. finally, investigating combinations of  xxxd1815xxx  with other tyrosine kinases,
such as imatinib or  xxxd2724xxx  (amn107) or
other inhibitors, such as farnesyl transferase
inhibitors, is appealing.
