abstract. the mechanism

by which 30% medium hyposmolarity induces prl secretion by gh4c1 cells was
compared with that induced by 100 nmol/l trh or 30
mmol/l k+. removing medium ca2+, blocking ca2+ channels with 50 \g=m\mol/l verapamil, or inhibiting calmodulin
activation with 20 \g=m\mol/ltrifluoperazine, 10 \g=m\mol/lchlorpromazine or 10 \g=m\mol/l  xxxd2956xxx  almost completely
blocked hyposmolarity-induced secretion. the smooth
muscle relaxant, w-7, which is believed relatively specific
in inhibiting the ca2+-calmodulin interaction, depressed
hyposmolarity-induced prl secretion in a dose-dependent manner (r \m=-\0.991, p<0.01 ). the above drugs also
blocked or decreased high k+-induced secretion, but had
=

much less effect on trh-induced secretion. secretion
induced by trh, hyposmolarity, or high k+ was optimal
at ph 7.3-7.65 and was significantly depressed at ph 6.0
or 8.0, indicating that release of hormone induced by all
3 stimuli is due to an active cell process requiring a physiologic extracellular ph and is not produced by nonspecific cell toxicity. the data suggest hyposmolarity and
high k+ may share some similarities in their mechanism
of stimulating secretion, which is different from that of
trh.

secretion is unknown and could be due to a variety

of factors, but the release of hormone is not due to
nonspecific toxicity (1-3). a rise in cytosolic ca2+
concentration is believed to be an important com¬
ponent of the secretory cascade between stimulus
and exocytosis in many systems (4,5). medium hy¬
posmolarity induces an increase in cytosolic ca2+
concentration in bladder epithelial cells (6) and in
erythrocytes of the worms, glycera dibranchiata
and noetia ponderosa (7). there is no rise in cy¬
tosolic ca2+ concentration if extracellular ca2+ con¬
centration is reduced below 100 nmol/l, indicating
that the rise in cytosolic ca2+ concentration is due
to increased influx of ca2+ across the plasmalemma

(6).

there is a significant difference in the role of
extracellular ca2+ concentration in hyposmolarityinduced secretion in normal pituitary compared to
tumor-derived gh cells. in the former, removal of
extracellular ca2+ concentration does not depress
hyposmolarity-induced secretion but markedly re¬
duces that induced by trh (8,9). the situation is
the reverse in gh cells: reduction of extracellular
ca2+ concentration depresses hyposmolarity-in¬
duced secretion to a much greater extent than that
due to trh (8). because of the dependence of
hyposmolarity-induced secretion on extracellular
ca2+ concentration in gh4c, cells and because
these cells are extensively employed to study trh
action, we utilized gh4c, cells to evaluate the effect
of calcium channel-blockers and calmodulin inhib¬
itors to obtain greater insight on the role of ca2+ in
hyposmolarity-induced secretion.

materials and methods
cell preparation

cells were grown in monolayer in ham's f-10
medium (gibco) supplemented with 15% horse serum
and 2.5% fetal calf serum (gibco) at 37°c (f-10+). four
days prior to the experiment the cells were harvested with
13.4 mmol/1 edta and subcultured in 24-well multiwell
tissue culture plates, each well containing 10° cells. one
day before the experiment the cells were placed in fresh
culture medium. to validate that each well contained an
approximately equal number of cells, basal secretion of
prl in each well during a 10-min incubation with f-10+
was measured. there was no statistical difference
(p>0.05) in basal prl secretion among the different wells
in which the control and test groups were randomly dis¬
tributed.
for the experimental studies, the cells in each well were
washed once with fresh f-10+, then incubated for 10 min
with medium containing various test substances. in some
experiments krebs-ringer-bicarbonate (krb) was used
for the incubation medium. where indicated an equimolar quantity of nacl was substituted for cacl2 in the krb
and 0.1 mmol/1 egta added to make a "ca2+-free"
medium. preliminary studies indicated that >50% of total
prl secreted in the presence of various types and con¬
centrations of secretagogues during a 1-h incubation was
released into the medium in the first 10 min. this cor¬
responds temporally to the initial high-amplitude secretagogue-stimulated secretory burst seen with perifused
gh4c, and other pituitary cell types (10,11). incubation
was terminated by
removing the incubation medium; the
media samples were stored at 20°c until assayed for
prl. at the end of incubation, >95% of the cells were
viable as measured by their ability to exclude 208 umol/1
trypan blue. to evaluate the possibility that the prl in¬
crease in the media may be caused by cell detachment we
compared centrifuged and uncentrifuged media. there
was no significant difference between the two
groups in
either ca2+-containing or ca2+-free media (p>0.05).

gh4c,

 xxxd2956xxx , 10 umol/1 chlorpromazine, and 20 umol/1  xxxd3431xxx  were chosen. preliminary study in our lab¬
oratory indicated that basal prl secretion and cell viabil¬
ity are not significantly affected at these concentrations.
prolactin assay
prl released into the medium

was measured by a doubleradioimmunoassay
using protocols and specific
antibody
reagents supplied by the national hormone and pituitary
program of the niddk. the samples from each exper¬
iment were analyzed in a single assay to avoid inter-assay
variation. the intra-assay coefficient of variation for all
assays was <8%. the upper and lower range of sensitivity
in all assays was between 1 and 50 ug/1. none of the drugs

utilized interfered with the prl assay.

statistics

experiments were repeated at least twice with essen¬
tially identical results each time. for each experiment,
there were four control wells containing medium alone
and four wells with each experimental condition. percent
inhibition was calculated by the formula:
[1-(st-ct)/(sc-cc)] x 100,
where: st stimulators + test agents, sc stimulators
alone, c, control + test agents, cc control alone. the
results were analyzed with the newman-keul's multiple
comparison test and linear regression and correlation
where indicated. a p-value <0.05 was considered statis¬
tically significant. all values are expressed as mean ± sem.

preparation of drugs and medium

the drugs to be tested were prepared immediately before
use.  xxxd2956xxx  (sigma) was initially dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, n-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chlorot -naphthalene sulfonamide (w-7, sigma) was dissolved in f-10+ via acidi¬
fication with 1 mol/1 hc1 to ph 3.2 during stirring in the
dark at room temperature, with adjustment of the ph to
7.3 after solubilization was achieved. verapamil (sigma),
 xxxd3431xxx  hc1 (sigma), chlorpromazine hc1 (steris
laboratories, phoenix, az, usa), trh (sigma), and kc1
were directly dissolved in f-10+. distilled deionized water
was added to the medium to
produce various degrees of
hyposmolarity; hc1 and naoh (0.1 mol/1) were used to
adjust the medium ph, which was measured with a corn¬
ing ph meter. to minimize any nonspecific effect which
these reagents may have in high concentration, 10 |xmol/l

discussion
previous perifusion studies have indicated that a
normal extracellular ca2+ concentration is not re¬
quired and in fact depresses hyposmolarity-in¬
duced hormone secretion in normal pituitary cells
(9), but is required in gh4c[ cells (8). surprisingly,
the reverse is true for trh; a normal extracellular
ca2+ concentration is necessary for the induction of
secretion by trh in normal pituitary cells, whereas
a normal extracellular ca2+ concentration is a
factor but is not essential for trh-induced secre¬
tion in gh cells (8,12). our present data show that
hyposmolarity also induces prl secretion in a
gh4c| cell monolayer system. this phenomenon is
dependent on ca2+ influx into the cell. trh-in¬
duced prl secretion in this system is less  xxxd2870xxx ¬
dent on extracellular ca2+ influx. this suggests
that ca2+ mobilization from intracellular pools or
other intermediary signal transducers such as pro¬
tein kinase c or camp may be more important than
ca2+ influx in trh-induced prl secretion in
gh4c, cells (13).
as indicated above, hyposmolarity-induced prl
secretion cannot be ascribed to cell death for the

following

reasons: 1) cell viability indicated by
blue
staining was not significantly different
trypan
before and after 10-min exposure to a 30% de¬
crease in osmolarity (p>0.05). 2) prl secretion was
optimal at a normal extracellular ph. 3) gh cells
grow and function well after prolonged exposure

to

50% hyposmolarity (3).

our conclusions are quite different from the
recent report of day & hinkle that 50% hyposmo¬
larity did not stimulate prl secretion in gh cells
and actually depressed secretion induced by trh
and  xxxd1742xxx  (3). it is highly probable that this
conflict is due to differences in experimental pro-

pre-incubation media, then continued the cell in¬
cubation in hyposmolar media for another 20 min,
during which hormone secretion was evaluated. in
our experiments, we rinsed the cells once in isosmolar media and then incubated them in hypos¬
molar media for 10 min without pre-incubation in
hyposmolar media. in dynamic perifusion studies,
when the cells are exposed continuously to hypo¬
smolarity for a prolonged period, peak high-am¬
plitude secretion occurs within the first 2 min and
returns to near baseline by 10 min (1,9). day &
hinkle's experimental design would have missed
the period of hyposmolar stimulation of secretion.
the cell line and the composition of the hyposmo¬
lar media we used were also different from theirs,
perhaps partially contributing to the different re¬
sults.
high-medium k+ depolarizes the cell membrane
and causes an influx of ca2+ into the cytosol, thus
inducing exocytotic secretion in many types of cells
(14). depleting extracellular ca2+ concentration or
the presence of 50 pmol/1 verapamil blocks hor¬
mone secretion induced by high extracellular k+
(15), suggesting that it is dependent on ca2+ influx
into the cell. in the present study secretion induced
by either high-medium k+ or hyposmolarity ap¬
peared dependent on an increased influx of ca2+
into the cytosol, consistent with direct observations
that hyposmolarity will increase the influx of
medium ca2+ across the plasmalemma (6). the
critical role of an influx of ca2+ in hyposmolarityinduced prl secretion in gh4ct cells is further
strengthened by our observation that the calcium

channel-blocker, verapamil, prevents hyposmola¬

rity-induced

secretion.
calmodulin is a heat-stable multifunctional ca2+binding protein that meets all the criteria for a ca2+
receptor (16). it is ubiquitous in eukaryotes (4). anti-calmodulin drugs inhibit the secretory activities
of many cells including neurotrophils (17), mast
cells (18), pituitary cells (19), and other endocrine
cells (20,21). it is widely accepted that exocytosis is
triggered by ca2+-calmodulin interactions rather
than by increased cytosolic ca2+ concentration per
se (5,22). neuroleptic drugs such as those we have
employed herein ( xxxd3431xxx , chlorpromazine,  xxxd2956xxx ) bind to the ca2+-calmodulin com¬
plex and thereby inhibit the complex from inter¬
acting with its target in the response cascade (23).
these agents thus can serve as important tools with

which to investigate the actions of cytosolic ca2+
concentration in biological systems. our data indi¬
cate that they are quite effective in inhibiting hy¬
posmolarity-induced secretion in gh4c, cells, al¬
though their action is probably not exclusively lim¬
ited to inhibiting the complexing of ca2+ and cal¬
modulin (24,25). however, the smooth muscle
relaxant w-7 is believed to be more specific (26,27),
although not completely so (28), in inhibiting calmodulin-dependent processes. in our studies, it
clearly inhibited prl secretion induced by both hy¬
posmolarity and high k+, although it had a much
lesser effect on secretion induced by trh.
reducing medium ph to 6.0 or increasing it to
8.0 decreased prl secretion induced by trh, hy¬
posmolarity or high-medium k+. the precise ex¬
planation for this inhibition is clouded, since we did
not measure intracellular ph and it is doubtful that
the intracellular ph would change to the same
extent as the medium ph because of intracellular
buffering mechanisms. however, the secretory
process induced by these agents is clearly optimal at
a physiologic extracellular ph. this is further ev¬
idence against hyposmolarity inducing secretion by
a nonspecific toxic effect.
our data are consistent with the concept that hy¬
posmolarity induces cell swelling and plasmalemma expansion of gh4c, cells. this causes an
increase in ca2+ influx through verapamil-sensitive
ca2+ channels with a resultant increase in ca2+calmodulin complexing which then activates exocytotic secretion. this concept is supported by our
recent observations with fura-2 that intracellular
ca2+ increases when gh^ cells are exposed to
hyposmolarity (29). prl secretion induced by
trh in gh cells is apparently achieved at least in
part by a different transducing mechanism which is
much less dependent on ca2+ influx across the plasmalemma (12,30).
it is particularly intriguing that the relative de¬
pendence on ca2+ influx of secretion induced by
hyposmolarity or trh is diametrically opposed in
gh4c, and normal pituitary cells (8,9). this indi¬
cates some profound difference in the reaction
chain by which secretion is induced in these two
types of cells. presumably the normal pituitary cells
are closer to the physiologic situation existing in
vivo. the available data suggest that in normal pi¬
tuitary cells, ca2+ channel-blockers and calmodulin
inhibitors should have a much greater effect on
trh-induced secretion than on the induced by hy¬

posmolarity.
