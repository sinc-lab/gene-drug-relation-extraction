specific aims
in mammals, two genes,  xxxg1378xxx  and  xxxg1379xxx , encode for
methionine adenosyltransferase (mat), which catalyzes
formation of  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ), the principal biological methyl donor and precursor for polyamines. we have shown that  xxxg1378xxx  knockout (referred
to as mato) mice have markedly lower hepatic  xxxd3156xxx 
levels, hepatic hyperplasia, and develop spontaneous steatohepatitis. the aim of the current study was to examine
the mechanisms and consequences of some of these
changes.

principal findings
1. chronic hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  deficiency led to an
aberrant gene expression profile reminiscent of
diabetes, obesity, and other conditions associated
with steatohepatitis
absence of hepatic  xxxg1378xxx  resulted in chronic hepatic
 xxxd3156xxx  deficiency. to examine the consequence of this
on differential hepatic gene expression profiles, we analyzed results obtained using oligonucleotide microarrays
from 3-month-old wild-type (wt) and mato mice according to the biological processes in which they participate. most genes up-regulated in mato mouse liver
clustered into four biological processes: cell communication, cell growth and/or maintenance, cell death, and
development. most genes that were down-regulated in
mato mouse were involved in metabolism. some of the
genes implicated in hepatocyte differentiation and proliferation that were up-regulated in mato mice include
␣-fetoprotein and  xxxg1379xxx , which are markers of differentiation, and  xxxg1681xxx , peroxisome
proliferator activator receptor ␥, and early growth response 1, markers of hepatocyte proliferation. likewise,
altered gene expression was observed in a variety of genes
known to be involved in acute-phase response and oxidative stress. for example, orosomucoid, metallothioneins 1
and 2, myeloperoxidase, lipopolysaccharide binding pro1292

tein, cd14, and fas antigen were up-regulated whereas
mitochondrial ribosomal protein s12, cyp4a10, and
cyp4a14 were down-regulated in mato mice. the expression of numerous genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was altered in mato mice liver.
 xxxg825xxx ,  xxxg1782xxx , 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6biphosphatase, glycerol kinase, and  xxxg1739xxx  were up-regulated in mato mice.
consistent with this abnormal expression of genes
involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, mato
mice had elevated hepatic tgl levels (26.4⫾4.2 mg/g
wet liver in wt mice vs. 114.5⫾33.1 mg/g wet liver in
mato mice, p⬍0.05) and hyperglycemia (8.17⫾0.72
mmol/l glucose in wt mice vs. 11.06⫾0.97 mmol/l in
mato mice, p⬍0.05) although the circulating levels of
insulin were normal (0.99 ng/ml insulin in wt vs. 0.92
ng/ml in mato mice).
2. hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  deficiency led to spontaneous
oxidative stress and increased expression of
 xxxg589xxx  ( xxxg589xxx ) and uncoupling
protein 2 ( xxxg2375xxx )
since  xxxg589xxx  is up-regulated in diabetes, obesity, and
steatohepatitis, we tested the hypothesis that  xxxg589xxx 
was also increased in mato mouse. we observed that
liver  xxxg589xxx  mrna and activity were induced in

rna (30 ␮g each lane) samples were analyzed by northern blot

cdna probe to ensure equal loading. representative northern

and wt animals untreated or treated with das. two doses of
das (200 mg/4 ml of corn oil/kg, p.o., controls received same
volume of corn oil) were administered to mice 12 h apart and
animals were killed 2 h after the second dose.  xxxg589xxx  activity
was determined as liver microsomal  xxxg589xxx -dependent hydroxylation of  xxxd2821xxx  (pnp) to p-nitrocatechol. results

3-month-old mato mice with respect to wt animals
(fig. 1a, b) and that when knockout mice were treated
with diallyl sulfide (das), an effective inhibitor of
 xxxg589xxx , hepatic  xxxg589xxx  activity was decreased (fig. 1b).
we also determined the expression of  xxxg2375xxx , an anion
carrier that uncouples the respiratory chain from oxidative phosphorylation and hence might enhance the vulnerability of hepatocytes to necrosis. although hepatocytes do not normally express uncoupling proteins, lipids
up-regulate  xxxg2375xxx  expression in hepatocytes and obesity
induces expression of  xxxg2375xxx  in hepatocytes and promotes
liver atp depletion. we observed that the hepatic content
of  xxxg2375xxx  mrna was markedly induced in mato mice
with respect to wt animals (fig. 1a).
consistent with increased expression of  xxxg589xxx  and
 xxxg2375xxx , the serum concentration of malondialdehyde, a
measure of lipid peroxidation, was higher in mato mice
than in wt animals. gsh synthetic enzymes are known to
be induced under oxidative stress. indeed, we observed
that the hepatic mrna levels of several key enzymes of the
trans-sulfuration and gsh synthetic pathways— cystathione ␤ synthase (cbs), glutamate-cysteine ligase (gcl)
subunits, and  xxxg982xxx —were all increased in
mato mice compared with wt animals (fig. 1a). despite this increase in the expression of genes involved in
gsh synthesis, hepatic content of gsh was reduced by
⬃40% in knockout mice vs. wt animals.
3. three-month-old mato mice are predisposed to
carbon tetrachloride (ccl4)-induced hepatotoxicity
due to increased expression and activity of  xxxg589xxx 
to examine whether the increased  xxxg589xxx  activity in
mato mice predisposes to toxicity, we examined the
liver injury and cancer in mice lacking  xxxg1378xxx 

effect of ccl4, a hepatotoxic molecule biotransformed
by  xxxg589xxx . histological analysis revealed that liver
injury caused by ccl4 was much more severe in mato
mice than in wt animals and that das administration
prevented ccl4-induced liver injury in mato mice. as
previously demonstrated, das treatment also ameliorated ccl4-induced liver injury in wt mice. liver injury
was evaluated also by measuring blood  xxxg941xxx  (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase
(ast) levels. baseline blood ast and alt levels were
similar in knockout and wt mice, but the elevation of
blood ast and alt levels in response to ccl4 was
much higher in mato mice than in wt animals. das
pretreatment markedly reduced the elevation of ast
and alt levels caused by ccl4 in knockout mice. das
administration also protected ccl4-induced ast and
alt elevation in wt mice.
4. chronic hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  deficiency led to
spontaneous generation of hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc)
we examined the consequence of chronic hepatic
 xxxd3156xxx  deficiency on hepatic tumorigenesis. by 18
months of age, five (two male and three female) of
eight mato mice (four male and four female) spontaneously developed hcc. the tumor is multifocal in
two animals but unifocal in the other three. the tumor
is composed of hepatocytes with round to oval nuclei
and prominent nucleoli, forming thickened trabecular
cords lined by endothelial cells. some of the tumor
cells contain fat (fig. 2). although the other three
animals did not have hcc, their livers contained cystic
and inflammatory changes.

conclusions and significance
 xxxg1378xxx  encodes a catalytic subunit that organizes
into dimers, mat iii, and tetramers, mat i;  xxxg1379xxx 
encodes a catalytic subunit that associates to form
mat ii. whereas the combination of mat i/iii
provides the hepatocyte with a set of enzymes capable
of efficiently metabolize methionine without being
inhibited by the cellular accumulation of  xxxd3156xxx ,
mat ii is strongly inhibited by ␮mol/l concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx . consequently, though the disruption of  xxxg1378xxx  in mato mouse leads to an increased
expression of  xxxg1379xxx , the capacity of the knockout
mice liver to metabolize methionine is markedly
diminished, and this leads to hypermethioninemia
and reduced hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  content. thus, the
mato mouse is an excellent model with which to
examine the consequence of chronic hepatic
 xxxd3156xxx  deficiency, a situation that likely occurs in
patients with advanced liver disease, where hepatic
mat activity falls and  xxxg1378xxx  expression is decreased.
analysis of the differential gene expression profiles
of knockout and wt mice suggests that mato mice
1293

have abnormal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
this was corroborated by the finding that mato
mice have elevated liver tgl levels and hyperglycemia. these alterations preceded any histological sign
of steatosis in the knockout mice.  xxxg589xxx  and  xxxg2375xxx 
are known to be up-regulated by aberrant nutritional
conditions such as diabetes and obesity. thus, abnormal metabolism rather than a direct effect of  xxxd3156xxx 
may be the trigger of the increased  xxxg589xxx  and  xxxg2375xxx 
expression in mato mice. consistent with this,
hepatic  xxxg589xxx  mrna content was unchanged in
2-wk-old mato mice; exogenous  xxxd3156xxx  did not
affect  xxxg589xxx  expression in primary hepatocytes
from 3-month-old mato mice but, as previously
demonstrated, reduced  xxxg1379xxx  expression.
consistent with this increase in  xxxg589xxx  activity,
knockout mice were more prone to develop liver
injury in response to ccl4. microarray data revealed
that hepatic mrna levels of cyp4a10 and cyp4a14
were reduced in mato mice. these results agree
with recent data indicating that the metabolic roles
of  xxxg589xxx  and cyp4a in lipid oxidation may be
complementary and the regulation of their expression coordinated. thus, in  xxxg589xxx  null mice, the
hepatic expression of cyp4a genes is up-regulated;
in obese diabetic ob/ob mice and fa/fa zucker rats, in
which  xxxg589xxx  is down-regulated, cyp4a genes are
up-regulated.
we also observed an increase in total lipid peroxides in serum and a marked decrease of hepatic gsh,
proof that a deficiency in  xxxd3156xxx  generates hepatic
oxidative stress in knockout mice. hepatic gsh levels
decreased in mato mice although the hepatic

figure 3. consequences of decreased hepatic  xxxd3156xxx .

mrna levels of several enzymes involved in cysteine
and gsh synthesis were markedly increased.
whereas the up-regulation of antioxidant genes may
reflect a general adaptive mechanism to dissipate
oxidative stress generated by oxidant genes such as
 xxxg589xxx ,  xxxg2375xxx , etc., the reduction in gsh content,
despite the induction of its synthetic enzymes, may
reflect the inability of the adaptive response to cope
with the level of oxidative stress and channeling of
 xxxd3156xxx  away from trans-sulfuration for cysteine synthesis, the rate-limiting precursor for gsh, due to its
markedly depleted level.
another important finding of this study was the
observation that knockout mice spontaneously develop
liver tumors. the induction in mato mice of hcc
strongly implies that  xxxg1378xxx  helps to prevent liver
cancer through its capacity to maintain high  xxxd3156xxx 
levels. this interpretation is consistent with our earlier
work showing that in hepatocarcinoma huh-7 cells
differing only in the type of mat gene that is expressed,  xxxg1379xxx  expression associates with more rapid
cell growth whereas the opposite is observed for
 xxxg1378xxx . cells expressing  xxxg1379xxx  had lower  xxxd3156xxx 
levels than cells expressing  xxxg1378xxx , and treatment of
huh-7 cells with  xxxd3156xxx  led to reduced cell growth.
 xxxd3156xxx  therapy has been shown to be effective in
preventing the growth of rat hcc and we have found
that addition of  xxxd3156xxx  to hepatocytes markedly inhibits hgf mitogenic activity.  xxxd3156xxx  accelerated the
resynthesis of i␬b and blunted the activation of nf-␬b
in cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes.
taken together, these results suggest a broad scenario
in which hepatocytes are kept in a proliferative, immature
state in response to a chronic deficiency in  xxxd3156xxx .
these immature hepatocytes have an impaired metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates reminiscent of that found
in diabetes, obesity, and other conditions associated with
steatohepatitis, which leads to the development of hcc.
further studies are required to clarify the mechanism by
which a chronic deficiency in  xxxd3156xxx  generates oxidative
stress, particularly since impaired  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis is a
common feature in human liver cirrhosis and this information may identify new targets for designing therapy of
this disease. figure 3 summarizes the main findings of this
work.
