abstract: two mutations, r450q and p803s, in the coding region of the human topoisomerase iir
gene have been identified in the atypical multidrug resistant (at-mdr) cell line, cem/vm-1, which exhibits
resistance to many structurally diverse  xxxg2312xxx -targeting antitumor drugs such as  xxxd3309xxx ,
doxorubicin,  xxxd168xxx , and mitoxantrone. the r450q mutation mapped in the atp utilization domain,
while the p803s mutation mapped in the vicinity of the active site tyrosine of human topoisomerase iir.
however, the roles of these two mutations in conferring multidrug resistance are unclear. to study the
roles of these two mutations in conferring multidrug resistance, we have characterized the recombinant
human dna topoisomerase iir containing either single or double mutations. we show that both r450q
and p803s mutations confer resistance in the absence of atp. however, in the presence of atp, the
r450q, but not the p803s, mutation can confer multidrug resistance. the r450q enzyme was shown to
exhibit impaired atp utilization both for enzyme catalysis and for its ability to form the circular protein
clamp. interestingly, an unrelated mutation, g437e, which is also located in the same domain as the
r450q mutation, exhibited multidrug hypersensitivity in the absence of atp. however, in the presence
of atp, the g437e enzyme is only minimally hypersensitive to various  xxxg2312xxx  drugs. in contrast
to the r450q enzyme, the g437e enzyme exhibited enhanced atp utilization for enzyme catalysis. in
the aggregate, these results support the notion that the multidrug resistance and sensitivity of these mutant
enzymes are due to a specific defect in atp utilization during enzyme catalysis.

human type ii dna topoisomerases catalyze an atpdependent strand-passing reaction (1-3). it does so by
transiently breaking one of the two crossing dna double
helices (4, 5). coupled to transient dna cleavage, each
subunit of the  xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2311xxx ) homodimer is
covalently linked to the 5′-phosphoryl ends of the transiently
broken dna strands (5). the crossing dna segment is
thought to be transported through the transient break and
the entire protein-protein interface (6). two type ii dna
topoisomerases, htop2r and htop2beta, have been identified
and characterized in human cells (7-9). htop2r is a cell
proliferation marker, with its highest level shown in the late
s and g2/m phase and its level dramatically reduced in the
g1/g0 phase of the cell cycle. htop2beta, on the other hand,
experiences little fluctuation during the cell cycle and is
present in both proliferating and quiescent cells (10, 11).
htop2r is involved in dna replication (12, 13), and

chromosome condensation and segregation (14-19). inhibition of  xxxg2311xxx  activity by icrf193 can cause m-phase arrest
of yeast and mammalian cells, consistent with a proposed
role of  xxxg2311xxx  as a major component of mitotic protein
scaffold (20).
both human top2r and  xxxg2312xxx  have been shown to be
molecular targets for many structurally diverse antitumor
drugs such as etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx ),  xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ),
adriamycin, mitoxantrone, and  xxxd168xxx  (21, 22). these
anticancer drugs are known to abort the cleavage/religation
cycles of  xxxg2311xxx , resulting in stimulation of the covalent
cleavage intermediate, the reversible cleavable complex (23).
a human leukemic cell line selected for resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  (ccrf-cem/vm-1) confers an “atypical” multidrug
resistance phenotype (24). this cell line is only cross-resistant
to  xxxg2311xxx  poisons that stabilize the reversible cleavable
complexes (25). nuclear extracts isolated from the resistant
cells exhibited reduced  xxxg2311xxx  catalytic activity and a reduced
capacity to form cleavable complexes in the presence of  xxxd3309xxx  (25). two point mutations have been identified and
mapped to r450q and p803s on the htop2r gene in this
resistant cell line (26, 27). the r450q mutation is located
in the b′ domain (28), while the p803s mutation is located
only two amino acids away from the active tyrosine (y805).
it is unclear whether both mutations are present in the same

allele or in separate alleles. the roles of these two mutations
in conferring the multidrug resistant phenotype are also
unclear. however, recent studies in a yeast system have
demonstrated that both mutations appear to be required for
maximum resistance to multiple  xxxg2311xxx  drugs (29).
to study the roles of these two mutations in conferring
multidrug resistance, we have constructed htop2r cdna
clones with either single or double mutations in a yeast
expression system. using partially purified recombinant
mutant htop2r, we have characterized their catalytic
activity, cleavage activity, and protein clamp forming activity
in vitro. we showed that in the absence of atp, the  xxxd3309xxx -induced dna cleavage activity of mutant htop2r with
either a single (r450q or p803s) or double (r450q/p803s)
mutation was greatly reduced. however, in the presence of
atp, only the r450q mutation is responsible for conferring
multidrug resistance to drug-induced dna cleavage. the
p803s mutation had no effect on drug-induced dna
cleavage in the presence of atp. this atp effect of the
r450q mutation was also mirrored by impaired atp
utilization for enzyme catalysis and the formation of protein
circular clamp. to further characterize the relationship
between the mutation in the b′ domain and drug resistance,
we also created another mutation g437e which is 13 amino
acids away from r450q in a “walker consensus sequence”
(30). surprisingly, in the absence of atp, this mutation
confers multidrug hypersensitivity rather than multidrug
resistance in the drug-stimulated dna cleavage assay. in
contrast to the r450q mutation, the  xxxg437xxx  mutation exhibits
more efficient atp utilization for enzyme catalysis.
materials and methods
materials. the yeast strain bcy123 (mata pep4::his3
 xxxg1936xxx ::leu2 bar1::hisg lys::gal1/10-gal4 can1  xxxg1661xxx 
trp1 ura3 his3 leu2-3,112) and the plasmid yepwob6
containing the wild-type htop2r cdna were obtained from
j. c. wang (harvard university, cambridge, ma). plasmids
pmj1/r450q and pmj1/p803s containing r450q and p803s
mutations, respectively, were constructed as described previously (29). cem and cem/vm-1 cell lines were obtained
from w. beck (cancer center, university of illinois at
chicago, chicago, il). p4 dna was isolated as described
previously (31, 32).  xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ) was obtained from
bristol-myers squibb co. icrf193 was obtained from t.
andoh (soka university, tokyo, japan).
p4 unknotting assay. the  xxxg2311xxx  catalytic activity was
measured by the p4 unknotting assay using knotted p4 dna
as described previously (32, 33). the  xxxg2311xxx  enzymatic
activity was estimated by 2-fold serial dilution of the enzyme.
for each reaction (25 µl), 200 ng of p4 dna was incubated
with the enzyme in the reaction buffer [40 mm tris (ph
7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm dtt, 0.5 mm
edta, and 30 µg/ml bsa]. after incubation at 37 °c for
30 min, each reaction was terminated by addition of 5 µl
of a stop solution (5% sucrose, 10 mm edta, 1% sarkosyl,
and 0.05% bromophenol blue) and then the mixture loaded
onto a 0.8% agarose gel. the electrophoresis was carried
out at room temperature for 4 h at 1.6 v/cm in tpe buffer
(0.09 m tris-phosphate and 0.002 m edta). the gel was
viewed under uv light after ethidium bromide staining.

unless otherwise indicated, 1 mm atp was included in all

construction of mutant htop2r overexpression plasmids. to construct plasmids overexpressing mutant htop2r,
the r450q and the p803s mutations in plasmids pmj1/rfq
and pmj1/pfs (29), respectively, were swapped into the
htop2r cdna in yepwob6 (35). briefly, the fragment
containing the r450q mutation was excised from pmj1/
rfq by digestion with ndei and kpni. the fragment was
then used to replace the corresponding htop2r cdna
fragment in yepwob6, resulting in yepm1. the p803s
mutation was similarly introduced from a ndei-kpni
fragment in pmj1/pfs into htop2r cdna in yepwob6,
resulting in yepm2. yepm3 was similarly constructed by
introducing both the r450q and p803s mutations into
htop2r cdna in yepwob6 (figure 1a). the mutation
g437e was generated by pcr-based site-directed mutagensis. three rounds of pcr were carried out to introduce the
g437e mutation into htop2r cdna in yepwob6. the
resulting plasmid is named yepm4 (figure 1a). the

purification of mutant htop2r from yeast cells. overexpression and purification of mutant enzymes were carried
out as described previously (35) with slight modifications.
plasmids containing either a single or double mutation were
separately transformed into a protease-deficient yeast strain
bcy123. the bcy123 harboring the plasmid was inoculated
into 100 ml of sd medium (synthetic uracil drop-out
medium) containing 2% glucose. when the cell density
reached an od600 of about 0.7, the culture was diluted with
1 l of fresh glucose-free sd medium containing 3% glycerol
and 1% lactic acid. when the od600 of this culture reached
about 0.7, galactose was added to a final concentration of
2%. after galactose induction for 12 h, yeast cells were
collected by centrifugation. the cell pellet was washed once
with prechilled water followed by washing with buffer i [50
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.7), 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 10%
glycerol/25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium bisulfite, 1
mm pmsf, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm  xxxd302xxx ,
5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin a]. after washing,
the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer i (1 ml of buffer
i per gram of the cell pellet) and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
frozen cells were thawed on ice and mixed with half a
volume of acid-washed glass beads (sigma). the mixture
was vigorously vortexed 10 times (vortexing for 20 s and
chilling for 40 s at 0 °c) at the maximum speed. the cell
lysate was centrifuged at 13000g for 15 min at 4 °c. the
supernatant was collected and subjected to high-salt peg
(5% peg and 1 m nacl) precipitation so nucleic acids could
be removed as described previously (36). the high-salt peg
supernatant was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite (bio-rad biogel htp) column. after loading, the column was washed
with 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) and eluted
with a linear salt gradient (0.2 to 0.7 m kpi). the fractions
containing activity were pooled and stored at -70 °c. the

figure 1: overexpression of mutant htop2r in the yeast system. (a) the plasmid map for the htop2r overexpressing plasmid, yepm.
plasmids, yepm1 (r450q), yepm2 (p803s), yepm3 (r450q/p803s), and yepm4 (g437e), were constructed from the same expression
vector, yepwob6, as described in materials and methods. yepwob6 contains wild-type htop2r cdna under the control of the pgal1
promoter. the three mutations are also denoted in the htop2r putative domains. (b) sds-page of partially purified recombinant htop2r.
fifteen microliters of each protein sample (wild type, r450q, and g437e) was loaded onto a 6% sds gel (bio-rad mini-gel system) (see
lanes 2-4, respectively). the same amount of protein for the wild-type enzyme (htop2r), p803s, and r450q/p803s (see lanes 6-8,
respectively) was also loaded onto a 4 to 20% gradient sds gel (ready gradient gel from bio-rad). lanes 1 and 5 contained the protein
molecular weight markers.

peak fractions of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were
analyzed on sds-page (figure 1b).
purification of enzymes from cem and cem/vm-1 cells.
cem and cem/vm-1 cells were cultured in the rpmi1640
medium supplemented with 10% fbs, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °c in a co2
incubator. ten liters of cells was used for each purification
following the procedure described previously (36). nuclei
isolation and high-salt peg precipitation were performed as
described previously (36). the peg supernatant was loaded
directly onto a hydroxyapatite column, and peak fractions
eluted from a linear salt gradient (0.2 to 0.7 m kpi) were
pooled. the pooled fractions were diluted and loaded onto
a bio-rex 70 column. peak fractions from the bio-rex 70
column eluted with the same salt gradient were pooled,
dialyzed against 30 mm kpi (ph 7.0), 50% glycerol, and 1
mm dtt, and stored at -70 °c.
filter binding assays. the formation of protein clamp was
assayed by glass fiber filter retention of circular dna using
a previously published method (1, 37). an equimolar mixture
of radiolabeled linear and circular dna samples was used

in each filter binding assay. the radiolabeled dna substrate
was generated by nick translation of nicked phc624 (38)
carried out in the presence of [3h]dctp (2.5 ci/mmol) for
1 h at 14 °c, followed by ligation with t4 dna ligase in
the presence of 5 µg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 h at 25 °c.
the mixture was then phenol extracted and run through a
sephadex g-50 spin column (amersham pharmacia biotech)
to remove the unincoporated nucleotides. to generate the
linear dna substrate, the labeled supercoiled dna was
digested with the restriction enzyme ecori. labeled dna
substrate (0.05 pmol, 7000 cpm) was incubated in a 25 µl
reaction mixture containing 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 50
mm kcl, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mm edta,
50 µg/ml bsa, and 15 nm wild-type or mutant htop2
proteins. the reactions were carried out in the presence 1
mm of atp with or without 1 mm icrf193. following
incubation at 37 °c for 15 min, the nacl concentration in
the reaction mixture was made 1 m by using a 5 m nacl
stock solution. the mixture was then filtered through a gf/c
glass fiber filter. a portion (2% of the filtrate by volume) of
the protein-free dna recovered from filtrate and a portion

figure 2: mutant  xxxg2311xxx  purified from cem/vm-1 cell lines
exhibits  xxxd3309xxx  resistance with a reduced dependence on atp. (a)
cell extracts prepared from cem/vm-1 cells exhibited a reduced
level of dna cleavage in the presence of  xxxd3309xxx . equal amounts
of cell extracts from cem and cem/vm-1 cells were used in the
cleavage assay. the cleavage reactions were carried out in the
presence of 1 mm atp with different concentrations of  xxxd3309xxx  as
indicated. (b) dna cleavage induced by partially purified mutant
 xxxg2311xxx  from cem/vm-1 cells exhibits minimal atp stimulation
in the presence of  xxxd3309xxx . wild-type and mutant  xxxg2311xxx  were
partially purified from cem and cem/vm-1 cells, respectively,
as described in materials and methods. the cleavage assays in the
presence of either 5 or 100 µm  xxxd3309xxx  were performed to monitor
drug sensitivity. equal amounts of enzymes were used in each
reaction. the reaction mixtures containing 1 mm atp were labeled
+atp at the top of the lanes. the reaction mixtures without atp
were labeled -atp at the top of the lanes.

(10% of the wash by volume) of the protein-bound dna
recovered from filter by subsequent washing with 1% sds
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. all samples
were treated with 100 µg/ml proteinase k at 45 °c for 15
min before being loaded onto a 1.6% agarose gel containing
1 µg/ml ethidium bromide. at the end of gel electrophoresis,
the gel was dried and autoradiographed.
results
 xxxg2311xxx  isolated from the multidrug resistant cell line
cem/vm-1 is resistant to  xxxd3309xxx .  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna
cleavage in the presence of  xxxd3309xxx  was performed in a
standard cleavage assay using 32p end-labeled yepg dna.
as shown in figure 2a, cell extracts prepared from cem/
vm-1 cells exhibited a much (about 10-100-fold) reduced
level of dna cleavage in the presence of  xxxd3309xxx  as
compared to the levels of those prepared from the wild-type
cem cells, consistent with the previous report (25).  xxxg2311xxx 
was also partially purified from both cem and cem/vm-1
cells (see materials and methods). partially purified  xxxg2311xxx 
from cem/vm-1 cells, as expected, was resistant to  xxxd3309xxx  (data not shown). strikingly, wild-type and mutant  xxxg2311xxx 
exhibited quite different dna cleavage properties in the
presence of  xxxd3309xxx . dna cleavage by wild-type  xxxg2311xxx  was
strongly atp-stimulated (figure 2b). in the presence of 1
mm atp,  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by vm-

mao et al.
26 was stimulated more than 50-fold (figure 2b). by
contrast, under the same conditions, dna cleavage by mutant
 xxxg2311xxx  was only minimally affected by 1 mm atp (figure
2b). the altered atp effect on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna
cleavage in nuclear extract prepared from the mutant cem/
vm-1 cell line has been reported previously (39).
both the r450q mutation and the p803s mutation of
htop2r confer resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  in the absence of atp.
to characterize mutant htop2r in cem/vm-1 cells,
recombinant enzymes were constructed and overexpressed
in yeast. the two putative mutations, r450q and p803s,
were introduced into htop2r either singly or in combination
(see materials and methods for construction and expression).
in the absence of atp, both r450q htop2r and p803s
htop2r exhibited about 10-100-fold greater resistance to
 xxxd3309xxx  than wild-type htop2r (figure 3; see the -atp
lanes). r450q/p803s htop2r exhibited several-fold greater
resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  than either r450q or p803s mutant
htop2r in the absence of atp (see figure 3 and table 1).
the r450q mutation but not the p803s mutation confers
resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  in the presence of atp. surprisingly,
in the presence of 1 mm atp, p803 mutant htop2r
exhibited wild-type sensitivity to  xxxd3309xxx  (figure 3). by
contrast, the r450q mutant enzyme exhibited about 300fold greater resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  than the wild-type enzyme
(figure 3). the double mutant (r450q/p803s) enzyme
exhibited resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  (about 300-fold) similar to
that of the r450q enzyme. the r450q mutant enzyme was
also shown to be cross-resistant to  xxxd168xxx  ( xxxd168xxx ),
adriamycin (adr), and mitoxantrone (mtx) in the presence
of 1 mm atp (figure 4).
r450q mutant htop2r exhibits reduced catalytic activity and requires higher atp concentrations for catalysis.
previous studies have shown that mutant  xxxg2311xxx  in the nuclear
extracts prepared from cem/vm-1 cells requires higher atp
concentrations for catalysis (39). to test whether the r450q
enzyme behaves similarly, the catalytic activity of the r450q
enzyme was assayed using the p4 unknotting assay. as
shown in figure 5, in the presence of 1 mm atp, the r450q
enzyme is about 4-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme.
however, in the presence of 10 µm atp, the r450q enzyme
was about 40-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme.
our preliminary studies using extensively purified enzymes
have also demonstrated that the r450q mutant enzyme has
reduced dna-dependent atpase activity (t. khalifah, t.
hu, t. s. hsieh, and l. f. liu, unpublished results).
the r450q enzyme exhibits impaired ability to form
the circular clamp in the presence of atp and icrf193.
wild-type  xxxg2311xxx  can form a circular clamp upon atp
binding and can be locked in that conformation with the
nonhydrolyzable atp analogue,  xxxd604xxx  (1). icrf193, a
derivative of bisdioxopiperazine, binds  xxxg2311xxx  and inhibits
atp hydrolysis, resulting in inhibition of  xxxg2311xxx  catalytic
activity (40). in the presence of icrf193 and atp,  xxxg2311xxx 
is arrested in a circular clamp conformation similar to that
formed in the presence of  xxxd604xxx  (41). the interlocking
between the  xxxg2311xxx  circular clamp and circular plasmid dna
has been demonstrated to be stable even in 1 m nacl using
a filter binding assay (1). the amount of the interlocked
 xxxg2311xxx -dna complexes can be estimated from salt-resistant
complexes by washing the filter with sds (1). using such
a filter binding assay, we showed that the amount of

figure 3: recombinant mutant htop2r exhibiting both  xxxd3309xxx  resistance and altered atp dependence. wild-type (htop2r), p803s,
r450q, and r450q/p803s enzymes were partially purified and used in the dna cleavage assay. the concentrations of  xxxd3309xxx , and the
presence (+atp) or absence (-atp) of 1 mm atp, are denoted at the top of the lanes. equal amounts of enzymes (based on protein
content) were used in each reaction (0.2 µg of each enzyme).

a cc
20 is defined as the  xxxd3309xxx  concentration necessary to cleave
20% of the plasmid dna. the relative cc20 is the ratio of cc20(mutant)
to cc20(wild-type). b atp stimulation is estimated as the -fold of
increased drug concentration in the absence of atp for achieving the
same extent of cleavage in the presence of atp.

interlocked  xxxg2311xxx -circular dna complexes in the presence
of 1 mm atp and 1 mm icrf193 was reduced 60% for
the r450q enzyme compared to that of the wild-type enzyme
(see the bands marked rc in figure 6).
g437e htop2r confers multidrug hypersensitivity in the
absence of atp. the r450q mutation is located in the b′
domain and appears to be part of the walker consensus motif
(r/k)x2-3gxlphi2(d/e) (amino acids 450-461) (28). close
inspection of the amino acid sequence surrounding this region
has identified another walker consensus motif (amino acids
434-444). to test whether mutations within this putative
walker consensus motif can also confer multidrug resistance,
we constructed the g437e mutant htop2r. surprisingly,
the g437e mutant enzyme exhibited multidrug hypersensitivity rather than multidrug resistance (figure 7). in the
absence of atp, the g437e enzyme was more than 100fold more sensitive to  xxxd3309xxx  than the wild-type htop2r
(figure 7; see the -atp lanes marked  xxxd3309xxx ). similarly,
in the absence of atp, the g437e mutant enzyme was more
than 100-fold more sensitive to adriamycin (adr) and
mitoxantrone (mtx) and about 10-100-fold more sensitive
to  xxxd168xxx  ( xxxd168xxx ) than the wild-type htop2r (figure
7; see the -atp lanes marked adr, mtx, and  xxxd168xxx ).
strikingly, in the presence of 1 mm atp, the g437e enzyme
and the wild-type enzyme exhibited almost identical sensitivity to all these  xxxg2311xxx  drugs (figure 7; see the +atp lanes).

figure 4: r450q enzyme exhibiting reduced catalytic activity at
low atp concentrations. the catalytic activities of the wild-type
enzyme (htop2r) and the mutant r450q enzyme were monitored
by the p4 unknotting assay as described in materials and methods.
equal amounts of the two enzymes were used, and the activities of
the two enzymes were compared using 2-fold serial dilution of the
enzymes. the atp concentrations for the reactions shown in the
gels were 1 mm (a) and 10 µm (b), respectively.

apparently, atp had a much reduced dna cleavage
stimulatory effect on the g437e mutant htop2r (less than
10-fold stimulation) than on the wild-type enzyme (100- to
>1000-fold stimulation depending on the drug) (figure 7).
the g437e mutant enzyme is catalytically more active
than the wild-type enzyme at low atp concentrations.
figure 8a shows that in the presence of 1 mm atp, the
g437e enzyme and the wild-type enzyme had about the same
specific activity. however, in the presence of 10 µm atp,

enzyme, in contrast to the r450q enzyme, is more efficient
in atp utilization for catalysis.
discussion
previous studies have identified two mutations, r450q
and p803s, in the coding region of the htop2r gene in the
atypical multidrug resistant cell line, cem/vm-1 (27, 28).

mao et al.
on the basis of our current studies with recombinant mutant
htop2r enzymes, it appears that one or both of these two
mutations in htop2r are likely to be responsible for atypical
multidrug resistance in cem/vm-1 cells.
in the absence of atp, both the p803s and the r450q
mutations can confer resistance to  xxxd3309xxx . this in vitro result
is consistent with results obtained from previous in vivo
studies with the yeast system (29). the molecular basis for
multidrug resistance in the absence of atp is unclear. it
seems possible that these mutations affect either a fundamental step in enzyme catalysis such as dna binding or a
common step in drug interaction with the enzyme-dna
complex such as drug intercalation into the dna duplex.
however, in the presence of 1 mm atp, only the r450q
mutation confers multidrug resistance. the p803 mutant
htop2r is as sensitive to  xxxd3309xxx  as the wild-type htop2r
in the presence of 1 mm atp. in the presence of 1 mm
atp, the r450q mutation appears to be dominant since the
double mutant, like the r450q mutant, is resistant to  xxxd3309xxx . atp is known to stimulate  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna
cleavage (33, 42). however, the mechanism for the stimulatory effect of atp on dna cleavage is not known. our
recent studies have demonstrated that the dna cleavage
stimulatory effect of atp is drug-dependent. dna cleavage
induced by drugs such as  xxxd3309xxx  and mmasa is very
sensitive to atp (more than 50-fold stimulation) and is also
strongly inhibited by adp. on the other hand, dna cleavage
induced by drugs such as amonafide and  xxxd320xxx  is much
less sensitive to atp and is also much less inhibited by adp
(43, 44; h. m. wang and l. f. liu, unpublished results).
both yeast and human  xxxg2311xxx  are known to undergo conformational change to form circular protein clamp upon atp
binding (1, 33, 41). the cleavage-stimulatory effect of atp
could be due to the circular clamp conformation which is
more favorable for the accumulation of the cleaved intermediate (the  xxxg2311xxx -drug-dna cleavable complex) in the
presence of many  xxxg2311xxx  poisons such as  xxxd3309xxx  and
 xxxd168xxx .
in the case of the r450q mutant enzyme, the affinity for
atp is probably reduced by the mutation, which could
explain why atp only has a minimal cleavage-stimulatory
effect on the r450q mutant enzyme. for the p803s mutant
enzyme, the mutation probably does not alter the atp
affinity for this enzyme. consequently, atp has the same
cleavage-stimulatory effect on this enzyme as that of the
wild-type enzyme (table 1). consistent with the cleavage
assay results, the ability of the r450q mutant enzyme to
form the circular clamp in the presence of atp and icrf193
is defective (figure 6). however, the ability of the p803s
mutant enzyme to form the circular clamp is similar to that
of the wild-type htop2r (data not shown). it seems plausible
that the atp-stimulated  xxxg2311xxx -mediated cleavage in the
presence of various drugs is related to the atp-stimulated
conformational change of  xxxg2311xxx .
we also studied another mutation, g437e, which is 13
amino acids upstream from the r450q mutation on htop2r.
the g437e mutation was generated by site-directed mutagensis and is not a mutation originally identified in the
cem/vm-1 cell line. the g437e mutation is also located
in the b′ domain. by aligning with the yeast  xxxg2311xxx  crystal
structure (45), it maps in a loop structure immediately before
the b′beta1beta sheet in the rossman fold structure (a putative

figure 7: g437e enzyme conferring multidrug hypersensitivity in the absence of atp. the cleavage assay was performed as described
in the legend of figure 4 except that another set of reactions which did not contain atp (denoted as -atp) was included; 0.2 µg of each
enzyme was used in the reaction. the concentrations of various drugs are denoted.

(lanes with “no drug” in figure 7). we have also observed
that the g437e enzyme requires a lower atp concentration
for its catalytic reaction than the wild-type enzyme (figure
8). these results suggest that the rossman fold structure
identified in the yeast  xxxg2311xxx  crystal structure may somehow
affect atp utilization and multidrug sensitivity and resistance. the simplest explanation is that this rossman fold
structure represents an atp binding site. however, recent
studies have demonstrated that the n-terminal fragments of
yeast  xxxg2311xxx  which do not contain this rossman fold exhibit
dna-stimulated atpase activity (47). it seems possible that
this rossman fold may allosterically affect the atpase
activity of  xxxg2311xxx , which in turn may affect multidrug
sensitivity and resistance. further studies are necessary to
determine the role of this rossman fold in atp utilization
during  xxxg2311xxx  catalysis and multidrug sensitivity and resistance.

g437e mutation in the same domain gives a phenotype
similar to that of the r450q mutation which maps in a loop
next to the b′beta1beta sheet. surprisingly, the g437e mutant
enzyme confers multidrug hypersensitivity instead of multidrug resistance (figure 7). this mutant enzyme has a higher
level of background cleavage than the wild-type enzyme
