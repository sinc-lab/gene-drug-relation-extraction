abstract
serotonin (5-ht)-receptor-based mechanisms have been postulated to play a critical role in the action of the new generation of
antipsychotic drugs (apds) that are usually referred to as atypical apds because of their ability to achieve an antipsychotic effect with lower
rates of extrapyramidal side effects (eps) compared to first-generation apds such as haloperidol. specifically, it has been proposed by
meltzer et al. [j. pharmacol. exp. ther. 251 (1989) 238] that potent  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism together with weak dopamine (da) d2
receptor antagonism are the principal pharmacologic features that differentiate clozapine and other apparent atypical apds from firstgeneration typical apd. this hypothesis is consistent with the atypical features of quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone,
which are the most common treatments for schizophrenia in the united states and many other countries, as well as a large number of
compounds in various stages of development. subsequent research showed that 5-ht1a agonism may be an important consequence of 5ht2a antagonism and that substitution of 5-ht1a agonism for 5-ht2a antagonism may also produce an atypical apd drug when coupled
with weak d2 antagonism. aripiprazole, the most recently introduced atypical apd, and a  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist, may also owe some of
its atypical properties to its net effect of weak d2 antagonism, 5-ht2a antagonism and 5-ht1a agonism [eur. j. pharmacol. 441 (2002) 137].
by contrast, the alternative ‘‘fast-off’’ hypothesis of kapur and seeman [am. j. psychiatry 158 (2001) 360] applies only to clozapine and
quetiapine and is inconsistent with the ‘‘slow’’ off rate of most atypical apds, including olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. 5-ht2a and
5-ht1a receptors located on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, 5-ht2a receptors on the cell bodies of da
neurons in the ventral tegmentum and substantia nigra and gabaergic interneurons in the cortex and hippocampus, and 5-ht1a receptors in
the raphe nuclei are likely to be important sites of action of the atypical apds. at the same time, evidence has accumulated for the important
modulatory role of 5-ht2c and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors for some of the effects of some of the current apds. thus, 5-ht has joined da as a critical
target for developing effective apds and led to the search for novel drugs with complex pharmacology, ending the exclusive search for
single-receptor targets, e.g., the d3 or  xxxg658xxx , and drugs that are selective for them.

interest in the role of serotonin (5-ht) in the mechanism
of action of antipsychotic drugs (apds) is the result, in large
part, of the evidence that the superior efficacy and tolerability of the ‘‘atypical’’ apds clozapine, quetiapine, olan-

 xxxd1733xxx , risperidone, and ziprasidone for some aspects of
schizophrenia may be due, in part, to their direct or indirect
effects on various 5-ht receptors, especially 5-ht2a and  xxxg1108xxx  receptors (meltzer, 1999; meltzer et al., 1989; millan
et al., 1998b,c; liégeois et al., 2002; ichikawa and meltzer,
1999; carlsson, 1978; gefvert et al., 1998; lieberman,
1993; maurel-remy et al., 1995). relatively potent blockade of 5-ht2a receptors coupled to weaker antagonism of
dopamine (da) d2 receptors has been found to be the only
classical pharmacologic features those atypical apds share
in common (creese et al., 1976; meltzer, 1999; meltzer and
stahl, 1976; kapur and seeman, 2000; reynolds, 1996).
the atypical apds related to clozapine, e.g., risperidone,
olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone, increase the release
of da in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. da

terminals synapse on the dendritic spines and shafts of
pyramidal cells as well as on gabaergic inhibitory interneurons (sesack et al., 1995). the effect of atypical apds to
release da in the cortex and hippocampus may be critical to
their ability to improve cognition and negative symptoms
(meltzer and mcgurk, 1999; farde et al., 1988). as will be
discussed, the so-called ‘‘5-ht2a/d2’’ model continues to
be generative of novel apds with efficacy for psychosis,
cognitive dysfunction, and low extrapyramidal side effects
(eps). the purpose of this review is to consider the role of
5-ht in the efficacy and side effects of the novel antipsychotic agents and possible strategies for developing other
antipsychotic agents that depend upon serotonergic function
in ways that differ from those of clozapine.

2. serotonin receptors involved in apd action
the major 5-ht receptors implicated in the action of
clozapine and other recently introduced antipsychotic
agents, or of potential value for developing more effective
or better tolerated antipsychotic agents, include the following: 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, 5-ht3,  xxxg1119xxx , and 5-ht7
receptors (meltzer and nash, 1991). it follows from this that
the 5-ht transporter, a major route for inactivation of 5-ht,
would also impact on the effectiveness and tolerability of
apds. this would explain the ability of selective 5-ht
reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants, which inhibit
5-ht reuptake to cause a wide range of eps, including
tardive dyskinesia in vulnerable subjects (meltzer et al.,
1979; gill et al., 1997). a possible role of the 5-ht2a
receptor in the action of clozapine was suggested by
numerous investigators (altar et al., 1986; rasmussen and
aghajanian, 1988; meltzer et al., 1989). the hypothesis that
a relatively high affinity for the  xxxg1113xxx  compared
to their affinities for the  xxxg656xxx  was the basis for the
difference between ‘‘atypical’’ and ‘‘typical’’ antipsychotic
agents (with atypical antipsychotic defined as an agent
causing low eps at doses with demonstrated or putative
antipsychotic activity) contributed to the development of
most of the current generation of atypical antipsychotic
agents: quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone,
all of which have higher affinity for 5-ht2a than for d2
receptors (meltzer, 1999; meltzer et al., 1989; schotte et al.,
1996).  xxxg1108xxx  agonism has also been suggested to
be able to contribute to an atypical apd profile (vandermaelen and braselton,1990; wadenberg and ahlenius,
1991). although only aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine
and ziprasidone (lawler et al., 1999; burris et al., 2002;
ozdemir et al., 2002) are 5-ht1a agonists, the effect of
risperidone and olanzapine, as well as these agents, to
increase da release in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats
is blocked by the 5-ht1a antagonist way100635 (ichikawa
et al., 2001a), suggesting that 5-ht1a agonism is an
important component of the action of all members of the
5-ht2a/d2 antagonist family as well as aripiprazole. thus,

both 5-ht2a antagonism and 5-ht1a agonism may be the
most important of the5-ht receptors for apd action.
while some of these atypical apds also have affinities
for 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx  or 5-ht7 receptors that are in the same
range as that for the  xxxg1113xxx , comparable affinity
for 5-ht2a and none of the other 5-ht receptors is
characteristic of all of these agents (roth et al., 1994;
meltzer and fatemi, 1996; schotte et al., 1996). thus, it
is not likely that high affinity for the 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx  or 5ht7 receptor are of primary importance to the low eps
profile of the entire class of agents, or another shared
characteristic, such as ability to improve cognition (meltzer
and mcgurk, 1999; harvey and keefe, 2001). however,
this does not rule out that the low eps effects of specific
drugs, or other actions, including the ability to improve
cognition are dependent, in part, on their affinities for one or
more of these 5-ht receptors or for other types of receptors,
e.g., the alpha1- and  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic receptors (hertel et
al., 1999; wadenberg et al., 2000). furthermore, there is
considerable evidence for interactions among the 5-ht2a, 5ht2c and 5-ht1a receptors (roth et al., 1994, 1995;
meltzer, 1999). because of space limitations, this article
will focus on these three 5-ht receptors and briefly consider
the others.
2.1. serotonin 5-ht2a receptors
the  xxxg1113xxx  is widely distributed in the brain
with highest concentrations in the cortex (hoyer et al.,
1986). 5-ht2a (and 5-ht1a) receptors have been localized
on the cortical and hippocampal pyramidal glutamatergic
neurons (hirose et al., 1990; jakab and goldman-rakic,
1998 ) as well as on gabaergic interneurons (willins et al.,
1997), both of which play a key role in schizophrenia. 5ht2a receptors on g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) interneurons stimulate gaba release, and thereby, have an important
role in regulating the inhibition of neuronal activity (cozzi
and nichols, 1996; abi-saab et al., 1999). however, 5ht2a receptors located on pyramidal neurons can also
diminish the effect of gabaa currents, thereby reducing
the net inhibition due to gaba (feng et al., 2001).
risperidone has been found to block this effect (feng et
al., 2001).  xxxg1117xxx  receptors also modulate gabaa signalling on pyramidal neurons bidirectionally (cai et al.,
2002a,b). 5-ht2a receptors are also located in the substantia
nigra and ventral tegmentum from which the nigrostriatal
and mesocorticolimbic da neurons arise, respectively
(hoyer et al., 1986; nocjar et al., 2002), as well as their
terminal regions, indicating the possibility of a relevant
roles for these receptors in modulating many of the actions
of apds.
several postmortem studies have found a significant
decrease in cortical 5-ht2a receptors in schizophrenia
(arora and meltzer, 1991; burnet et al., 1996). however,
a recent pet study failed to find a decrease in 5-ht2a
receptors in the cortex of 10 unmedicated patients with

h.y. meltzer et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 27 (2003) 1159–1172

schizophrenia (okubo et al., 2000). this discrepancy may
be related to the effect of some apds to down-regulate 5ht2a receptor density (matsubara and meltzer, 1989).
as previously mentioned, many atypical apds, e.g.,
clozapine and risperidone, bind with high affinity to 5ht2a receptors (meltzer et al., 1989). this is the case for
some typical apds, including chlorpromazine and spiroperidol, as well. not all atypical apds do so. exceptions
include the substituted benzamide drugs, including sulpiride, sultopride,  xxxd155xxx , raclopride,  xxxd3096xxx  and
tiapride (chivers et al., 1988), which are highly specific
antagonists of d2 and d3 receptors (burt et al., 1975;
seeman et al., 1975; sokoloff et al., 1990; gessa et
al.,1991; kramer et al., 1997). there are some muscarinic
agents that may be antipsychotic (bymaster and felder,
2002). the substituted benzamides may owe their atypical
properties to their potent d3 antagonism. what distinguishes
the subgroup of atypical apds with 5-ht2a antagonism
from the typical apds that are also potent 5-ht2a antagonists, however, is that all the atypical agents, but none of
the typical antipsychotics, have significantly greater affinity
for the  xxxg1113xxx  than they do for the  xxxg656xxx 
(meltzer et al., 1989; schotte et al., 1996). several atypical
antipsychotic compounds, e.g., clozapine, melperone and
 xxxd3195xxx , were not directly selected for clinical development on the basis of this pharmacological model. they were
empirically found to have lower eps potential first in
animal models and then in man. however, risperidone,
quetiapine and olanzapine, as well as blonanserin, org5222 and ziprasidone, to name a few, were chosen for
development because they fit this model. many compounds
have now been identified that are consistent with this model
(see, meltzer, 1999, for a review). indeed, all compounds
that fit this model have proved to have atypical antipsychotic properties, whether in animal models, e.g., doserelated differential blockade of dopaminergic models of
psychosis vs. catalepsy, or in clinical trials, where they
produce minimal eps at doses that are antipsychotic.
blonanserin (oka et al., 1993) is an example of a drug that
fits this pharmacologic profile, which has very weak affinity
for any other type of receptor linked to antipsychotic action.
neuroimaging studies with some of these atypical antipsychotics have confirmed that at clinically effective doses, at
least in the lower dose range where eps are minimal, their
occupancy of 5-ht2a receptors in the human cortex exceeds
their occupancy of d2 receptors in the striatum (str) (farde
et al., 1992, 1995; nordstrom et al., 1993, 1998; nyberg et
al., 1993; kapur et al., 1998, 1999; okubo et al., 2000). this
is even truer for their occupancy of d2 receptors in extrastriatal regions such as the ventral midbrain and thalamus
(kessler and meltzer, unpublished data).
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism may confer atypicality on
apds with relatively weaker  xxxg656xxx  antagonism (or
partial  xxxg656xxx  agonism) because of the ability of 5ht2a receptors to modulate the activity of dopaminergic
neurones differentially in different regions of the brain. as

1161

mentioned earlier, excitatory 5-ht2a receptors are present
on pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus;
these glutamatergic neurones project rostrally to midbrain
nuclei containing cell bodies of monoaminergic neurones
and regulate their firing rate (jakab and goldman-rakic,
1998; martı́n-ruiz et al., 2001). cortical pyramidal cells
also express inhibitory 5-ht1a receptors, which, as previously mentioned, play an important in the action of apds.
the dynamic interplay between 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors influence, along with many other factors, the net
increase in the release of glutamate from these neurons
(davies et al., 1987; araneda and andrade, 1991).
considerable information as to how  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists modulate dopaminergic activity differentially
in the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical systems
has been obtained from microdialysis as well as electrophysiological studies. administration to rodents of selective
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists, such as haloperidol or sulpiride,
produces a large increase in extracellular da concentrations
in the neostriatum and in the nucleus accumbens (nac),
whereas the increase in extracellular da in the prefrontal
cortex produced by these agents when given alone is modest
(pycock et al., 1980; moghaddam and bunney, 1990; pehek
and yamamoto, 1994; kuroki et al., 1999; liégeois et al.,
2002). in contrast, the predominant effect of (salmi and
ahlenius, 1996) is to increase da levels in the mouse
prefrontal cortex (mpfc) with smaller increases in the other
two regions (moghaddam and bunney, 1990; pehek and
yamamoto, 1994; kuroki et al., 1999; fig. 1).
the administration of a mixed 5-ht2a/2b/2c receptor
antagonist, ritanserin, alone had little effect on the release
of da in any brain region (andersson et al., 1995).
however, when ritanserin was combined with a selective
d2/3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, facilitation of da
release in the prefrontal cortex was observed, whereas the
raclopride-induced da release in the str was unaffected
(andersson et al., 1995). similar observations have been
obtained with a highly selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist,
m 100907 (seeman and van tol, 1994; westerink et al.,
2001). a recent study of the dose – response relationship for
this effect from our laboratory found that the synergy
between m 100907 and haloperidol was greatest at low
doses of haloperidol, e.g., 0.1 mg/kg, which would be
expected to produce much less than 80% occupancy of d2
receptors (seeman et al., 1976; liégeois et al., 2002; fig 2).
there was no synergy with regard to cortical release of
da between m10fs0907 and high-dose haloperidol, 1.0
mg/kg, which would be expected to fully occupy cortical d2
receptors (fig. 3).
this provides clear support for the importance of potent
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism coupled with weak  xxxg656xxx 
blockade and suggests that it may be possible to generate a
clozapine-like profile, at least for the effect on cortical da
release, with doses of haloperidol, which have slight impact
on nigrostriatal function, by augmentation with a 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist. the 5-ht2a antagonist m100907 sup-

pressed the haloperidol-induced release of da in the nac
at both low and high doses of haloperidol (carlsson and
lindquist, 1963; lee et al., 1994; liégeois et al., 2002).
these observations suggest that concomitant blockade of 5ht2a and d2 receptors may stimulate the mesocortical da
pathway relative to the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. this idea has been confirmed with a series of mixed
5-ht2a/ xxxg656xxx  antagonists, including the atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, zotepine,
and quetiapine, which all cause a marked rise in extracellular da concentrations in mesocortical projection areas
(volonté et al., 1997; kuroki et al., 1999; rollema et al.,
2000; rowley et al., 2000; stephenson et al., 2000; westerink et al., 2001; ichikawa et al., 2002c). low-dose
haloperidol, by itself, does not reproduce the cortical effects

of clozapine on da release (marcus et al., 2002). if
mesocortical dopaminergic activity is important for the
antipsychotic action of these drugs, especially with respect
to impact on negative symptoms and cognition, this enhanced activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic system,
compared to the nigrostriatal system, may explain why the
atypical apds show antipsychotic effects at doses that do
not produce eps.
these neurochemical results are consistent with behavioural studies showing that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists can
potentiate effects of  xxxg656xxx  antagonists in animal
models of apd action. thus, ritanserin increases the effect
of raclopride to block conditioned avoidance responding in
rats, a classic test of antipsychotic potential (wadenberg et
al., 1996). augmentation of low-dose haloperidol with

ritanserin improved negative symptoms (duinkerke et al.,
1993), whereas monotherapy with ritanserin was found to
improve both positive and negative symptoms without any
occupancy of d2 receptors (wiesel et al., 1994). although
ritanserin has adverse cardiovascular side effects and cannot
be approved for general use, other  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists such as m100907, sr46349-b and acp-103 could
be useful as adjunctive antipsychotic treatments or possibly
as monotherapy in some psychotic states, including treatment of patients with l-dopa-induced psychosis. however,
recent results with sr46349-b, another 5-ht2a/2c receptor
antagonist devoid of  xxxg656xxx  antagonism, suggest that
this drug may have useful clinical properties when used
alone (rinaldi-carmona et al., 1992; talvik-lotfi et al.,
2000; bonaccorso et al., 2002; meltzer et al., unpublished
data). the difference between sr46349-b and, e.g.,
m100907, may be attributable to an interaction with 5ht 2c receptors, as will be subsequently discussed.
nra0045 is a putative atypical apd studied only in rats
to date. it produces minimal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in vivo
in contrast with high occupancy of 5-ht2a and alpha1adrenoceptors, which has been suggested to be the basis for
its atypical profile (chaki et al., 1999).
there is also intriguing evidence that 5-ht2a single
nucleotide polymorphisms determine some of the variation
in response to treatment with clozapine and perhaps other
atypical apds as well (arranz et al., 1995; masellis et al.,
1998).
kapur et al. (1999), who initially strongly endorsed the
hypothesis of potent 5-ht2a and relatively weaker d2
antagonism as the basis for the atypical antipsychotic
properties of clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone (kapur and remington, 1996), subsequently rejected
any role for 5-ht in the action of clozapine and related

drugs, arguing that the difference between typical and
atypical antipsychotics may be fully explained by the
kinetics of their interaction with the  xxxg656xxx  (kapur
and seeman, 2000, 2001) and that low doses of drugs such
as haloperidol could achieve most, if not all, of the benefits
of clozapine with regard to antipsychotic action and eps
(kapur and seeman, 2000, 2001). they embraced the ‘‘fastoff’’ theory, originally postulated by burki et al. (1975), i.e.,
that atypical apds do not bind tightly to the  xxxg656xxx  and
can be easily displaced by endogenous da (kapur and
seeman, 2000). however, this theory could only apply to
quetiapine and clozapine, which have low affinity for the d2
receptor and, thus, according to elementary kinetic considerations, would have a high kd, i.e., a rapid rate of
dissociation from the d2 receptors. (according to the law
of mass action, the dissociation rate from a receptor is
related to its affinity, with ki = kon/koff.) only low-affinity
drugs such as clozapine have ‘‘fast’’ dissociation rates.
however, as shown by their own data, koff, directly measured (kapur and seeman, 2000) or calculated from kon (a
relative constant which can be calculated from the data in
kapur and seeman, 2000) and ki data reported by them in
various publications, or others, of atypical apds with a high
affinity to the  xxxg656xxx , such as  xxxd2330xxx , blonanserin,
olanzapine, org-5222, risperidone and ziprasidone, must
be slow. table 1 provides the koff data as reported by kapur
and seeman (2000) or calculated by the method described
above. it may be seen that  xxxd3195xxx , an atypical apd with
virtually no eps throughout its clinical range (zimbroff et
al., 1997), actually has a slower koff rate than haloperidol,
whereas olanzapine has a koff rate that is only slightly more
rapid than chlorpromazine and much slower than quetiapine
and clozapine. these considerations lead to a clear rejection
of the koff hypothesis as a general model.

from kapur and seeman (2000).

kapur and seeman (2001) argue that the atypical features
of some substituted benzamides such as  xxxd155xxx  indicate that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism is not needed to
explain atypicality. this is certainly true for  xxxd155xxx ,
but could not apply to drugs such as  xxxd3195xxx , ziprasidone
or risperidone, which have such a high affinity for the d2
receptor that they would be expected to produce severe eps
without some other pharmacologic characteristic to counteract the effect of the expected high occupancy of d2
receptors. this group has recently shown that changing
the ‘‘5-ht2a/d2’’ ratio of clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  by making
isomers, isoclozapine and  xxxd2511xxx , which have lower and
higher ratios, respectively, creates a typical neuroleptic in
the case of isoclozapine, and an atypical antipsychotic in the
case of isoloxapine (kapur et al., 2002; vanderspek et al.,
2003). while these authors conclude that this validates the
hypothesis that modulation of the  xxxg656xxx  plays the
critical role in determining the typical vs. the atypical
properties of an antipsychotic, it does no such thing,
because the two starting compounds, clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx , have 5-ht2a antagonist properties. the challenge,
which they have not yet met, would be to do this same
exercise with compounds that lack 5-ht2a antagonist
properties or something that might be comparable, e.g.,
alpha1- or  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic antagonist properties, and
make such conversions in eps liability relative to antipsychotic potency.
the ability of atypical antipsychotics to stimulate dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex may underlie the
demonstrated benefit of such drugs on cognitive performance (hagger et al., 1993; green et al., 1997; laruelle
and abi-dargham, 1999; purdon, 2000). it has been
demonstrated in monkeys that this neuronal system is
important for optimal performance in psychomotor tasks,
via activation of local d1 receptors (sawaguchi and goldman-rakic, 1991). improving cognitive function is an
important attribute of certain atypical antipsychotics, helping to maintain adequate social integration of the patient
(meltzer and mcgurk, 1999; mcgurk and meltzer, 2000).
nonetheless, clozapine causes impairment of working
memory after 1 –2 months of treatment, which nevertheless
normalises after 6 months of treatment (hagger et al.,
1993; lee et al., 1999). this memory deficit appears at
the same time as other measures of cognitive function start

to improve and is not observed with other atypical antipsychotics. it has been suggested that overstimulation of
d1 receptors, as with too little stimulation, may lead to
impairment in some aspects of working memory (williams
and goldman-rakic, 1995; arnsten, 1998). okubo et al.
(1997) reported binding of radioligand to the  xxxg655xxx 
was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of drug-naı̈ve or
medication-withdrawn patients with schizophrenia. this
reduction was related to the severity of the negative
symptoms (for instance, emotional withdrawal) and to poor
performance in the wisconsin card sorting test consistent
with the concept of decreased dopaminergic activity in the
cortex being important for cognitive function and negative
symptoms. decreased  xxxg655xxx  density might result
from down-regulation because of excessive release or too
little inactivation of da. it should be noted that clozapine
is also a partial agonist at the  xxxg655xxx  (salmi and
ahlenius, 1996), and this could lead to excessive d1
receptor stimulation and impairment of cognition. no other
atypical apd is, to our knowledge, a  xxxg655xxx  partial
agonist. the finding that cognition in schizophrenia is
worse in patients with the valval genotype of catecholo-methyl-transferase (comt), an enzyme that inactivates
da by o-methylation, than in those who have the val/val
genotype (egan et al., 2001) is further evidence that too
little da stimulation in the cortex can impair cognition.
there is also evidence that apds acting at 5-ht2a
receptors may improve the mood state of patients with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. the notion that serotonergic neurotransmission is involved in the control of mood
has been popular for a long time, and this is the neurochemical target of many of the most widely used antidepressant drugs (nutt, 2002). in particular, certain 5-ht2a
receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of major
depressive disorders, namely, trazodone and nefazodone
(de vane, 1998), whereas ritanserin has been shown to be
useful in the treatment of dysthymia (lapierre, 1994). it has
been demonstrated that augmentation treatment with risperidone (ostroff and nelson, 1999) or olanzapine (shelton et
al., 2001) can improve outcome in patients with treatmentresistant depression treated with selective 5-ht reuptake
inhibitors (ssris), although patient numbers in these trials
were small. nonetheless, these studies have generated much
interest in the notion that such atypical antipsychotics may
have a more universal clinically useful effect on mood
(thase, 2002). in the context of improving mood in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics drugs, it has
long been recognised that clozapine has a more beneficial
effect on mood than do typical antipsychotic medications
(ranjan and meltzer, 1996; anonymous, 1998). in several
of the recent clinical trials of mixed 5-ht2a/ xxxg656xxx 
antagonists in schizophrenia, improvement on clinical rating
scale for depression has been manifest (anonymous, 1998),
although significant differences with comparators have not
always been observed. it should be noted that clozapine has
been found to be superior to olanzapine in the reduction of

h.y. meltzer et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 27 (2003) 1159–1172

suicidal behaviors in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are at high risk for suicide (meltzer
et al., 2003). this effect may be related, in part, to 5-ht2a
receptor antagonism and its effects on neurotransmitter (e.g.,
da, norepinephrine (ne) and 5-ht) release.
2.2. 5-ht release
serotonin has been found to have complex effects on
cognition in animal and human studies. our laboratory
(ichikawa et al., 1998) studied the effect of  xxxd162xxx , an
atypical apd which is a 5-ht2a antagonist without appreciable d2 antagonism, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
haloperidol and s(  )-sulpiride on extracellular 5-ht levels
in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nac of awake, freely
moving rats, using in vivo microdialysis with dual probe
implantation. risperidone and clozapine significantly increased extracellular 5-ht levels in the medial prefrontal
cortex and the nac, respectively.  xxxd162xxx  significantly
increased extracellular 5-ht levels in both regions. olanzapine, s(  )-sulpiride, haloperidol and the selective 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist m100,907 had no significant effect on
extracellular 5-ht levels in either region. thus, the ability to
increase extracellular 5-ht levels in the medial prefrontal
cortex and the nac by these apds is not directly related to
their affinity for 5-ht2a receptors because olanzapine and
m100907 had no significant effect on extracellular 5-ht
levels. a variety of mechanisms other than those involving 5ht2a receptors, e.g., reuptake inhibition ( xxxd162xxx ) and
blockade of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (olanzapine and clozapine), may contribute to the ability to increase extracellular
5-ht levels in the brain. the increase in extracellular 5-ht
levels in the medial prefrontal cortex or nac following
 xxxd162xxx , clozapine, or risperidone administration may
not be related to the effect on psychotic symptoms but could
be related to the effects on other types of psychopathology
such as depression, negative symptoms, or cognition. somewhat similar results were reported by antoniou et al. (2000)
in acute and chronic studies of 5-ht turnover in the
hippocampus.
2.3. serotonin 5-ht1a receptors
the  xxxg1108xxx  is perhaps the best characterised 5ht receptor subtype from a functional point of view, and
plays an important role in controlling the activity of monoaminergic neurones (see barnes and sharp, 1999, for a
review). this receptor subtype can be considered as functionally antagonistic to the  xxxg1113xxx , both at the
presynaptic and postsynaptic level. activation of inhibitory
5-ht1a autoreceptors on the cell bodies in the raphe nucleus
attenuates firing of these neurons (sprouse and aghajanian,
1986; sprouse et al., 1999; blier and de montigny, 1987).
activation of 5-ht2a receptors, in contrast, generally leads
to activation of serotonergic neurones by multiple mechanisms, including a direct or indirect mechanism to inhibit

1165

gabaergic inhibitory interneurons, and a direct effect to
excite glutamatergic and other neurons (matsuyama et al.,
1997; celada et al., 2001). postsynaptically, both 5-ht1a
and 5-ht2a receptors are localised on the pyramidal neurones in the cortex, where the  xxxg1108xxx  inhibits
neuronal output by activation of a hyperpolarising potassium current, and the 5-ht2a facilitates output via activation
of phospholipase c (araneda and andrade, 1991; martı́nruiz et al., 2001). it has been suggested that 5-ht1a
receptors may be found on presynaptic terminals of gaba
neurons and pre- and/or postsynaptically on the gabaergic
interneurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
(matsuyama et al., 1997). this opposition between the
two 5-ht receptor subtypes suggests that agonists at  xxxg1108xxx  receptors may modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain in a similar fashion to  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists.  xxxg1108xxx  agonists can stimulate the
release of da in the prefrontal cortex as well as potentiate
the effect of  xxxg656xxx  blockers on da release (ichikawa
and meltzer, 1999). this potentiation is antagonised by the
selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way100635. local
administration of way1001635 into the rat prefrontal
cortex blocked the effect of subcutaneous mkc-242, a
potent selective 5-ht1a agonist, to increase cortical da
release in the cortex (sakaue et al., 2000). these authors
also found that fluoxetine and buspirone increased da
release in the prefrontal cortex. buspirone, a 5-ht1a partial
agonist, but not fluoxetine, increased da release in the
nac as well. mkc-242 also increased da release in the
hippocampus. these results suggest that  xxxg1108xxx 
activation is critically involved in the regulation of da
release in these two brain regions, which are involved in key
cognitive function.
because clozapine has been shown to be a partial agonist
at 5-ht1a receptors (assié et al., 1997; newman-tancredi
et al., 1998), the possibility arises as to whether the effects
of clozapine on mesocortical da release might be mediated
by activation of this receptor subtype. this idea is supported
by the observation that the stimulatory effects of clozapine
are attenuated by way100635 (rollema et al., 1997;
ichikawa et al., 2001a,b). this finding has since been
extended to ziprasidone and quetiapine, which are also  xxxg1108xxx  receptor partial agonists (newman-tancredi et al.,
1998), and more surprisingly, to risperidone and olanzapine,
which are not (travis et al., 1998; rollema et al., 2000;
ichikawa et al., 2001a, 2002c). in addition, the facilitatory
effects of m100907, a highly selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist (ichikawa et al., 2001a), and sr46349-b, a
mixed 5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonist (bonaccorso et al.,
2002), on sulpiride- or haloperidol-evoked cortical da
release are also abolished by way100635. taken together,
these results suggest that atypical antipsychotics exert their
effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, at least in part,
via activation of 5-ht1a receptors (millan, 2000), presumably due to concomitant potent 5-ht2a and relatively weak
 xxxg656xxx  antagonism (ichikawa et al., 2001a).

1166

h.y. meltzer et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 27 (2003) 1159–1172

this concept has important clinical implications, suggesting that  xxxg1108xxx  agonists may be of use in combination with  xxxg656xxx  blockade for the development of
future generations of atypical antipsychotics with a wide
spectrum of action (bantick et al., 2001). that this may be
possible has been supported by two small pilot studies, one
double-blind, of augmentation of low-dose haloperidol
treatment by the  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist tandospirone (sumiyoshi et al., 2001a,b). both studies showed a
beneficial effect of tandospirone augmentation on cognitive
function over conventional antipsychotic treatment alone. it
should be noted that the literature on the effect of 5-ht1a
agonists (as well as other serotonergic agents) on cognition
is conflicting with some studies indicating improvement,
and others impairment (meneses, 1998).
it has recently been demonstrated that  xxxg1108xxx 
stimulation leads to a reduction of the amplitude of the
stimulation of the ampa-type  xxxg981xxx  in pyramidal neurons of the pfc (cai et al., 2002b). the molecular
basis for this effect was shown to be inhibition of ca2 + /
calmodulin-dependent kinase ii which was due to inhibition
of  xxxg1836xxx  and ensuing activation of protein
phosphatase 1 (cai et al., 2002b). the authors suggested
this may be a mechanism by which 5-ht1a receptors
modulate memory and anxiety.
agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors may contribute to
the efficacy of the novel antipsychotic agent aripiprazole
( xxxd221xxx ), which is currently undergoing regulatory
approval for the treatment of schizophrenia. this drug was
originally developed as a presynaptic da  xxxg656xxx  partial
agonist, with some postsynaptic  xxxg656xxx  antagonist
properties (kikuchi et al., 1995). however, it is more
effective and better tolerated than previously studied partial
da agonists (kane et al., 2002; jordan et al., 2002). this
may be because aripiprazole also has potent  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist activity, with an affinity of 17 nm, as well
as 5- partial agonism and  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonism is
 xxxd336xxx , currently in clinical trials in patients with
schizophrenia. unlike aripiprazole, it lacks  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism. it will be interesting to see whether this agent is
also effective and well tolerated.
2.4. serotonin 5-ht2c receptors
many drugs that bind to 5-ht2a receptors with high
affinity also bind to some extent to the structurally related 5ht2c receptor. this receptor has received relatively little
attention in studies of apds, but may well be important in
explaining some of the differences observed between the
various apds, and in pointing the way for future apd
development. roth et al. (1992) demonstrated that highaffinity binding to the  xxxg1115xxx  did not distinguish
typical and atypical apds. messenger rna for the 5-ht2c
receptor is present in both the cell bodies and terminal fields
of dopaminergic neurones of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems (pompeiano et al., 1994). they are also located

on the soma of da neurons in the ventral tegmental area
and substantia nigra, where they play a key role in regulating the tonic activity of these neurons. although certain
atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, aripiprazole,
olanzapine and ziprasidone, bind to 5-ht2c receptors with
relatively high affinity comparable to their 5-ht2a or d2
affinities, quetiapine, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx  do not.
similarly, among the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists, which
lack appreciable d 2 receptor affinity, ritanserin and
sr46349-b have significant  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists,
whereas m100907 does not. certain specific ligands for this
receptor, which are devoid of  xxxg1113xxx  affinity, have
been developed, e.g., the agonist ro 60-0175 and the
antagonists sb242084 and b206553. the latter is also a
 xxxg1114xxx  antagonist.
striatal 5-ht2c receptors exert a facilitatory control on
basal da release, which appears to be both tonic and phasic
(lucas and spampinato, 2000). 5-ht2c receptors appear to
mediate the tonic inhibitory serotonergic tone on da neurones in the ventral tegmental area (prisco et al., 1994;
kelland and chiodo, 1996; millan et al., 1998a; di matteo
et al., 1999; gobert et al., 2000 ). the consequence of this is
that administration of  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists can
directly increase da release in the nac and in the prefrontal cortex (di matteo et al., 1998) and 5-ht2c agonists
such as ro 60-0175 markedly suppress dialysate levels of
da and noradrenalin in the frontal cortex of rats (millan et
al., 1998a). it will be recalled that the selective 5-ht2a
receptor antagonists m100907 only does this when d2
receptors are concomitantly blocked. stimulation of da
release in these areas has been demonstrated with
sb242084 (millan et al., 1998a) and sb206553 (di matteo
et al., 1998; gobert et al., 2000). activity at 5-ht2c
receptors may also explain why sr46349-b, unlike
m100907, is able to increase da release in rat mpfc
(bonaccorso et al., 2002).
these findings suggest that the combination of 5-ht2a
and  xxxg1115xxx  blockade may be a more efficient
way of augmenting antipsychotic action than either alone.
for the moment, neither a highly selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist nor a true mixed 5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonist has been evaluated in schizophrenia. this
mechanism may contribute to explaining the apparently
superior efficacy of sr46349-b compared to m100907 in
the treatment of schizophrenic patients (meltzer et al.,
unpublished data). behavioural studies with sb228537, a
selective 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist and using selective
5-ht2a and  xxxg1114xxx  antagonists as controls
indicate that  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism can produce a
significant reversal of haloperidol-induced catalepsy
(reavill et al., 1999). however, not all atypical apds
are  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists, e.g., risperidone (roth et
al., 1992).
an association between antipsychotic-induced weight
gain and the 750c/t polymorphism of the  xxxg1115xxx 
in a group of chinese patients with schizophrenia was

h.y. meltzer et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 27 (2003) 1159–1172

recently reported (reynolds et al., 2002), but these results
were not replicated.

1167

8-oh-dpat (ruat et al., 1993), did not affect ach release
in the mpfc (consolo et al., 1996; yamaguchi et al.,
1997a,b).

2.5. serotonin  xxxg1119xxx /7 receptors
 xxxd2330xxx  has appreciable affinity for  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7
receptors like clozapine. the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor may be important to antipsychotic actions (roth et al., 1994; frederick
and meador-woodruff, 1999; branchek and blackburn,
2000; zhukovskaya and neumaier, 2000) and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (shinkai et al., 1999; ohmori et
al., 2001) or bipolar affective disorder (vogt et al., 2000). it
may be possible that sb271046, a selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor
antagonist, can improve cognition (rogers and hagan,
2001) via facilitation of cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic activity (dawson et al., 2001) and perhaps acetylcholine (ach) release.
a weak positive association has been reported between
the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor gene and a silent thymidine to cytosine
polymorphism at position 267 (c 267t) within the first
exon of  xxxg1119xxx  receptor and response to clozapine in a
chinese sample (yu et al., 1999). however, we were unable
to replicate this finding in a mixed caucasian/afro-american sample (masellis et al., 2001).
several studies suggest the role of  xxxg1119xxx  receptors in the
control of cholinergic transmission, perhaps including ach
release. for example,  xxxg1119xxx  receptors are not located on 5ht or da neurons, but possibly on cholinergic and
gabaergic neurons (branchek and blackburn, 2000). scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist,
reversed ‘‘stretching’’ behavior in rats produced by  xxxg1119xxx 
receptor antagonists (bourson et al., 1998; sleight et al.,
1998b; bentley et al., 1999; wettstein et al., 1999) or its
gene deficiency in mice (reviewed by branchek and blackburn, 2000). although  xxxg1119xxx  receptors distribute most
densely in the str and nac (sleight et al., 1998a; barnes
and sharp, 1999; branchek and blackburn, 2000),
sb271046, a selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, has been
reported to increase glutamate release but not da release in
the mpfc and dorsal hippocampus without an effect in the
nac or str (dawson et al., 2001). ach release could
increase in the mpfc via an interaction with glutamate
release (schoffelmeer et al., 1997; fadel et al., 2001),
although this is controversial (materi and semba, 2001).
clozapine and 8-oh-dpat, both of which increase
ach release in the mpfc (ichikawa et al., 2002a,b), have
appreciable affinity (ki), 61 and 52 nm, respectively, for 5ht7 receptors (ruat et al., 1993). however, clozapine is a
5-ht7 receptor antagonist (garraway and hochman, 2001)
and r(+)-8-oh-dpat may be a 5-ht7 receptor agonist
(ehlen et al., 2001) as well as a  xxxg1108xxx  agonist.
there is no clear evidence to date that 5-ht7 receptor
stimulation enhances ach release (nakai et al., 1998;
vanhoenacker et al., 2000). furthermore, the 5-ht2a/2c
receptor antagonist ritanserin, which has also potent affinity for 5-ht7 receptors compared with that of clozapine or

3. conclusions
to improve on the efficacy of antipsychotics that are
potent  xxxg656xxx  blockers, much interest has revolved
around complementing or replacing d2 dopaminergic antagonism by an action on serotonergic transmission. as d2
receptors are mainly localized in the limbic system and
str, whereas schizophrenia has key aspects such as cognitive impairment and deficits in motivation and affect,
which are largely dependent upon nonstriatal mechanisms
that are not directly targeted by d2 antagonists, it is clear
that there should be more effective means to treat this
complex syndrome.  xxxg1113xxx  blockade, under the
condition of weaker  xxxg656xxx  antagonism, may contribute
to the ability of atypical apds to increase da release in the
medial prefrontal cortex while having a smaller effect on
mesolimbic da release. this may contribute to their advantages for cognition, negative symptoms and antipsychotic
activity. antagonism at 5-ht2c receptors may also be useful
for improving cortical function. the use of  xxxg1108xxx 
agonists may substitute for 5-ht2a antagonism and achieve
many of the same benefits in combination with weak d2
receptor blockade. some new antipscyhotic drugs are weak
d2 antagonists or partial  xxxg656xxx  agonists, and 5-ht1a
receptor partial agonists; aripiprazole may owe its efficacy
and tolerability, which far exceeds that of other d2 partial
agonists that have been tried in schizophrenia, to 5-ht1a
receptor agonism, along with  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism.
further research is needed to determine how to use this
information to design more effective antipsychotic agents,
which can then be modulated by more selective agents. for
most patients, more complex agents such as the atypical
apds have greater potential for interacting at various
elements of the circuitry that underlies the multiple deficits
of schizophrenia.
