 xxxd2289xxx  (ha), a high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of repeating  xxxd2683xxx  and dglucuronic acid subunits, is an abundant glycosaminoglycan
present in ecm, connective tissue, cartilage, bone marrow,
and synovial fluid (1). several proteins have ha binding
properties and are found in various tissues. thus, cd44
was found on the sv-3t3 cell surface (2, 3).  xxxg1061xxx 
(receptor for ha-mediated motility) was found in the
culture media of 3t3 cells and chick embryo fibroblasts (4).
habps ( xxxd2289xxx -binding proteins) were found in
chick embryo (5). hyaluronectin was found in human brain
(6, 7). proteoglycan core proteins and link proteins were
found in cartilage (8-10), and  xxxg2297xxx  was found as a tumor
necrosis factor-inducible protein in human fibroblasts (11).

in the catabolism of ecm, proteolysis and its control
mechanism have been studied to some extent for matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps) (12-14) and tissue inhibitors
of matrix metalloproteinases (timps) (15, 16). the degradation of ha and its regulation mechanism, however, have
not been elucidated clearly. only limited knowledge is
available on hyaluronidase (ph-20) on sperm membrane
(17). when we searched for ha-binding proteins in human
plasma using ha-conjugated sepharose, we found that only
one protein specifically bound to the column. in this paper,
we describe the purification of a novel ha-binding protein
( xxxg1011xxx ) from human plasma and the molecular cloning of
its cdna.

a novel hyaluronan-binding protein ( xxxg1011xxx ) was purified from human plasma by affinity
chromatography on hyaluronan-conjugated sepharose. the contaminating igm and albumin in the partially purified preparation were removed with anti-igg antibody-conjugated
sepharose and anti-albumin antibody-conjugated sepharose, respectively, and no other
contaminant was observed. finally, 800 pig of  xxxg1011xxx  was isolated from 500 ml of human
plasma.  xxxg1011xxx  gave a single 70-kda band on sds-page under non-reducing conditions,
and 50-kda and 17-kda bands under reducing conditions. thus,  xxxg1011xxx  was a heterodimer
composed of 50-kda and 17-kda subunits, bridged by a disulfide linkage. both subunits
had novel n-terminal ami no acid sequences, indicating that  xxxg1011xxx  was a novel hyaluronanbinding protein in human plasma. the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide
sequence of the cloned  xxxg1011xxx  cdna exhibited significant homology to that of hepatocyte
growth factor activator (hgfa). the results of northern blot analysis indicated that liver,
kidney, and pancreas expressed  xxxg1011xxx  mrna. the predicted structure of  xxxg1011xxx  showed
three  xxxg681xxx  (egf) domains, a kringle domain and a  xxxg745xxx 
domain, from its n-terminus, although hgfa has a fibronectin type h domain, an egf
domain, a fibronectin type i domain, an egf domain, a kringle domain, and a serine
protease domain, from its n-terminus.

with lysylendopeptidase. various combinations of the
primers were used for pcr with quick-clone™ cdna
(human liver; clontech laboratories) as a template for
amplification of a  xxxg1011xxx  cdna fragment. the reaction
mixture (100/^1) comprised 10 mm tris-hcl, ph8.3, 50
mm kc1,1.5 mm mgcl2,0.001% gelatin, 0.5 ^gcdna, 0.2
mm of each dntp, 2.5 units of recombinant taq dna
polymerase, and 0.5 //m primer. the reaction mixture was
overlaid with one drop of light  xxxd2648xxx . the reactions
were carried out for 5 cycles (94'c: 30 s, 37'c: 30 s, 72'c:
1 min), and 30 cycles (94'c: 30 s, 55'c: 30 s, 72'c: 1 min),
followed by final extension at 72'c for 5 min, using a dna
thermal cycler (perkin elmer cetus). when the primers
(nl and cl) based on the amino acid sequences, tvclpdgsfpsechisgwgvtetgk (primer nl.tlclpd. sense,
64-fold degeneracy) and pgqdtcqgdsggpltcek (primer cl, gpltcek, antisense, 256-fold degeneracy) were
used for pcr, an about 250-bp dna fragment was amplified. to confirm the pcr product, it was reamplified using
primers n2 (chisgw) and c2 (qdtcqgd), which were
based on other amino acid sequences within the same
peptides.
screening of human liver cdna—the pcr product
subcloned into puch9 was labeled with [a- 32 p]dctp by
the random priming method (22) (du pont-new england
nuclear kit) for use as a screening probe. the labeled probe
was used in a conventional plaque hybridization procedure
(23) to screen a human liver cdna library constructed in
the agtll phage vector (clontech laboratories). the
hybridization was carried out in a solution comprising 5 x
ssc, 5 x denhardt's, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5,100 ^g/ml
of denatured salmon sperm dna, 0.1% sds, 10% dextran
sulfate, and 50% formamide at 42°c. the membranes were
washed with 2 x ssc containing 0.1% sds at room temperature and then with 0.1x ssc containing 0.1% sds at 50°c.
several rounds of screening were carried out to obtain
positive clones.
characterization of the isolated positive clones and
construction of full length cdna—the inserts of two
independent positive clones (c7-1 and c8-1) were mapped
using several restriction enzymes and then subcloned into
the puc119 vector. after subcloning of the inserted dna,
the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (24) with a shimadzu
dna sequencer model dsq1000. the sequence of clone
c8-1 was all included in that of clone c7-1, which did not
contain the full length cdna of  xxxg1011xxx . in order to construct
the full length cdna, the 5'-end of the  xxxg1011xxx  transcript
was amplified by the pcr technique according to the
method described by edwards et al. with a slight modification (25). to obtain the (-)-strand of  xxxg1011xxx  cdna, the
human liver cdna (quick clone™ cdna; clontech) was
amplified using primer  xxxg1011xxx -anti-900, which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence just downstream of the
5'-end of clone c7-1. the reaction was performed as
follows: 7 min at 96'c for initial denaturation, 25 cycles of
amplification using a step program (96'c, 1 min; 55*c, 1
min; 72*c, 2 min), and final extension at 72'c for 15 min.
the excess amounts of primers and dntp were removed
with a centricon-30 (amicon, usa). the sample was
concentrated to 23//i by centrifugation under reduced
pressure. the ( — )-strand cdna was then tailed with
poly(c) at its 3'-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransj. biochem.

branes (hybond n) were purchased from amersham
japan. nitrocellulose filters were from schleicher and
schuell. multiple tissue northern blot and quickclone™ cdna (human liver) were purchased from
clontech laboratories. a random-primer labeling kit was
obtained from du pont-new england nuclear.
purification of  xxxg1011xxx —ha-sepharose was prepared
according to the method of tengblad (18). briefly, eahsepharose (50 ml), ha (100 mg), and iv-ethyl-iv'-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (5 g) were mixed in
200 ml of distilled water, and then the ph was adjusted to
4.5 with 0.1 n hc1. the mixture was rotated at room
temperature overnight. the gel was washed with 0.5 m
nacl, 0.1 m sodium acetate, ph 4.0, and then 0.5 m nacl,
0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 8.3, three times alternately. then, the
resulting ha-sepharose was washed with phosphatebuffered saline (pbs). human plasma (500 ml) was applied
to the ha-sepharose column (50 ml) at theflowrate of 150
ml/h. after washing with 0.5 m nacl containing 10 mm
sodium phosphate and 0.1% np-40, ph7.0 (500 ml),
followed by with distilled water (100 ml), the bound
proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-hcl, ph 2.5. the
absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm, after
neutralization with 1 m tris. the contaminating igm and
albumin in the  xxxg1011xxx  preparation were removed by passage
through columns of anti-igg antibody-conjugated sepharose and anti-albumin antibody-conjugated sepharose,
respectively, as described previously (19).
electrophoresis—sds-page was performed according
to the method of laemmli (20) in slab gels (10% gel or
12.5% gel) under reducing or non-reducing conditions.
after electrophoresis, proteins in a gel were stained with
0.1% coomassie brilliant blue g-250 in 10% acetic acid and
30% methanol for 30 min, and then the gel was destained in
10% acetic acid and 30% methanol.
amino acid sequence analysis—after electrophoresis,
proteins in the gel were transferred to a pro blot membrane
(applied biosystems) in 20 mm tris containing 150 mm
glycine and 20% methanol electrically. the proteins on the
membrane were stained with 0.1% coomassie brilliant
blue g-250 in 1% acetic acid and 40% methanol for 1 min,
and then the membrane was destained with 50% methanol.
the protein bands were cut off and their n-terminal amino
acid sequences were analyzed with a 473a protein sequencer (applied biosystems). for intra-molecular amino acid
sequence analysis, the purified  xxxg1011xxx  (70 /zg) was reduced
and carboxymethylated according to the method of cleland
(21). the carboxymethylated  xxxg1011xxx  was digested with 1 mg
of lysylendopeptidase at 37'c overnight in 10 mm trishcl, ph 7.0. the peptides were separated by hplc on a
syn chropak rp-p column (2.1 x 250 mm; syn chrom) as
follows. the digested sample was applied to the column,
which had been equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile in 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (tfa). the peptides were eluted with a
linear gradient of acetonitrile (5-50%, 45 min) in 0.1% tfa
at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. the peptide peaks were
monitored by measuring the absorbance at 214 nm and
appropriate peaks were collected. the n-terminal amino
acid sequence of each material was analyzed as above.
preparation of a specific screening probe for  xxxg1011xxx 
cdna—several sense and antisense mixed oligonucleotide
primers were synthesized based on the amino acid sequences of the peptides generated on digestion of  xxxg1011xxx

ferase with 1 mm dctp. after heat treatment of the
reaction mixture at 65'c for 15 min, the mixture was
diluted to 300 //i with 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta, ph
8.0. the diluted mixture (10 ^1) was amplified with primer
amp-dg-20 [5'-ccgaattcgg(g)20-3'] and primer
 xxxg1011xxx -anti-900. both primer amp-dg-20 and primer
 xxxg1011xxx -anti-900 contain ecobi recognition sites at their
5' -ends for subcloning. the pcr reaction was carried out as
follows; the reaction mixture was denatured at 95'c for 5
min and then cooled to 72'c, followed by the addition of 2.5
units of taq dna polymerase, and then was overlaid with
one drop of  xxxd2648xxx . for initial extension, the reaction

mixture was annealed at 50*c for 2 min and then extended
at 72"c for 30 min. the following amplification was carried
out with a step program (94"c, 1 min; 50°c, 1 min; 72'c, 2
min, 35 cycles) and final extension at 72'c for 15 min. the
pcr product (5'-race) was extracted with phenol/chloroform, digested with ecobl, and then separated on a 1.5%
agarose gel. the resulting pcr product was subcloned into
the ecobl-digested puch9 plasmid vector.
northern blot analysis—a multiple tissue northern
blot (clontech laboratories), which had been blotted with
polyadenylated rna from various human tissues, was used
to analyze the expression of  xxxg1011xxx  mrna. the filter was

purification of  xxxg1011xxx —when human plasma was applied
to a column of ha-sepharose, a small fraction (0.02%) of
plasma proteins bound to the column and were eluted with
0.2 m glycine-hcl, ph 2.5. these ha-binding proteins
gave >203-, 70-, and 50-kda bands on sds-page under
non-reducing conditions, and 80-, 55-, 50-, and 28-kda ones
under reducing conditions (fig. 1, a-1). from these results,
we assumed that igm and albumin contaminated the eluate.
then, the ha-sepharose column eluate was applied to
columns of anti-igg antibody-conjugated sepharose and
anti-albumin antibody-conjugated sepharose. the resulting eluate gave a single band of 70 kda on sds-page
under non-reducing conditions (fig. 1, a-2, lane 1). finally,
800//g of ha-binding protein ( xxxg1011xxx ) was purified from
500 ml of human plasma. the purified  xxxg1011xxx  bound to
newly prepared ha-sepharose, indicating the direct binding of  xxxg1011xxx  to ha (data not shown). n-terminal amino
acid sequence analysis of  xxxg1011xxx  revealed several sequences, suggesting that  xxxg1011xxx  was composed of several
peptides.  xxxg1011xxx  gave 50- and 17-kda bands on sds-page
under reducing conditions (fig. 1, a-2, lane 2), and both
materials exhibited two n-terminal amino acid sequences,
respectively (fig. lb). sequence 2 (major sequence) started
from the fifth amino acid of sequence 1 (minor sequence) in
the 50-kda material, and sequence 2 (major sequence)
started from the seventh amino acid of sequence 1 (minor
sequence) in the 17-kda material. these results suggested
the trimming of four and six amino acids from the nterminals of the 50- and 17-kda materials, respectively. a
homology search of these sequences with the published
databanks [genetyx  xxxg2302xxx , nbrf-pdb (pie) rel. 44 and
swiss-prot rel. 31] indicated that  xxxg1011xxx  was a novel
protein and the sequence of the 17-kda material showed
partial homology to that of  xxxg1044xxx 
activator (hgfa), which is known as a  xxxg745xxx 
(data not shown). from these results, we concluded that
 xxxg1011xxx  was a novel ha-binding heterodimer, in which the
two subunits were bridged by disulfide linkage(s).
intra-molecular amino acid sequence analyses of
 xxxg1011xxx — xxxg1011xxx  (70 us) was reduced and carboxymethylated, and then digested with lysylendopeptidase (1 //g). the
digested sample was applied to a reversed-phase hplc
column and the peptides were separated (fig. 2a). the
n-terminal amino acid sequence of each peptide supported
that  xxxg1011xxx  was a novel protein (fig. 2b), and peak
materials 13, 18, and 24 showed significant homologies to
hgfa (data not shown). peak materials 11,12,17, 21, and
22 gave two or three amino acids at every step, while peak
materials 36 and 37 showed no detectable sequences.

isolation and sequencing of  xxxg1011xxx  cdna cbnes—tcb.
was applied to amplify the cdna fragment encoding  xxxg1011xxx 
from human liver cdna. the pcr product amplified with
the two mixed oligonucleotide primers (nl and cl) was
about 250 bp in size and was confirmed to encode the amino
acid sequences of the peptides which were used for the
design of the pcr primers, the nested pcr and nucleotide
sequence analysis (data not shown). after subcloning of the
amplified cdna fragment into the puc119 plasmid vector,
it was used as a probe to clone the full-length  xxxg1011xxx  cdna
from a human liver cdna library. approximately 8 x105
clones of the cdna library were screened with the
32
p-labeled probe, two positive clones being isolated. these
two clones (clones c7-1 and c8-1) were sequenced and
found to be truncated at their 5'-ends. the full length cdna
of  xxxg1011xxx  was constructed as described under "materials
and methods." figure 3a shows a restriction map of clone
c7-1, the region of the probe produced by pcr, the 5'race, and the sequencing strategy for  xxxg1011xxx  cdna. the
constructed cdna had an overall length of 2,312 bp and
contained an open reading frame encoding 560 amino acid
residues. the molecular weight of the precursor of  xxxg1011xxx 
was calculated to be 62,670 from the sequence. the
complete nucleotide sequence of  xxxg1011xxx  cdna and the
amino acid sequence deduced from it are shown in fig. 3b.
although the nucleotide sequence surrounding the first
in-frame initiation codon at nucleotides 1-3, gcctgatgt, does not match well the consensus sequence, ccaccatgg, described by kozak (26, 27), this codon appears to be
the most likely candidate for the translation start site
because this methionine is followed by 23 hydrophobic
amino acid residues, which may be in a signal peptide
sequence (28). the second in-frame codon, atg, 9 bp
downstream from the first in-frame one, is also possibly the
initiation codon. the third in-frame codon, atg, 24 bp
further downstream from the second in-frame one, is
unlikely to be the initiation codon because the putative
signal peptide is too short. as shown in fig. 3b, the c7-1
clone included a 3'-poly(a) tail and the consensus polyadenylation signal, aataaa (29), positioned at 46 nucleo-

distribution of the  xxxg1011xxx  message in adult human
tissues—the expression of  xxxg1011xxx  mrna in human adult
tissues was examined by northern blot hybridization. a
multiple tissue northern blot (clontech laboratories),
which had been blotted with polyadenylated rnas from
human adult heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas, was probed with the
3z
p-labeled cdna (clone c7-1). two hybridized signals (3
and 2.3 kb) were detected in the liver, kidney and pancreas
(fig. 4). a small band of 1.3 kb was observed for the
pancreas besides the signals of 3 and 2.3 kb. in skeletal
muscle, only a 6 kb band was detected. the significance of
the appearance of these 1.3- and 6-kb bands is not clear at
present.

ha-binding proteins have been found in several tissues,
although ha-binding proteins in plasma have not been
reported so far. in this paper, we described the purification
and characterization of a novel ha-binding protein ( xxxg1011xxx )
in human plasma. the ha-sepharose column eluate contained only  xxxg1011xxx , igm, and albumin, suggesting that
 xxxg1011xxx  was a major ha-binding protein in human plasma
(fig. lb), and the contaminating igm and albumin could be
removed with anti-igg antibody-sepharose and anti-albumin antibody-sepharose, respectively. our results indicated that  xxxg1011xxx  was a disulfide-bonded heterodimer. sequence 2 of the 50-kda material showed cleavage on the
c-tenninal side of methionine, and sequence 2 of the 17kda material showed cleavage on the c- terminal side of
lysine, therefore, the cleavage of both n-termini might be

caused by different proteolytic enzymes.
we isolated two independent cdna clones (c7-1 and
c8-1) encoding  xxxg1011xxx  from a human liver cdna library.
clone c7-1 was found to contain the full sequence of clone
c8-1 insert cdna and to be truncated at the 5'-end. in
order to obtain the full length cdna, the 5'-end of the
human  xxxg1011xxx  transcript was amplified by the pcr technique. the nucleotide sequence of the constructed cdna
(nucleotides —96 to 2312) contained the full open reading
frame, starting at nucleotides 1-3 of the initiation codon
and terminating at nucleotides 1681-1683 of a stop codon
(taa). the 1,680 bp open reading frame coded for a
polypeptide of 560 amino acid residues. all amino acid
sequences of the peptides generated on digestion of  xxxg1011xxx 
with lysylendopeptidase are included in this reading frame,
supporting that this cdna encodes  xxxg1011xxx  (fig. 3b).
a homology search of the nucleotide sequence of  xxxg1011xxx 
cdna revealed that it was identical to that of hepatocyte
growth factor activator (hgfa)-like mrna registered in
ddbj by kitamura et al. (accession number, d49742). the
cdna of hgfa-like mrna is 3,008 bp in length, while
 xxxg1011xxx  cdna is 2,312 bp in length. this discrepancy is due
to the utilization of a different polyadenylation signal in the
3'-region of the  xxxg1011xxx  transcript. the precursor of  xxxg1011xxx 
consists of 560 amino acid residues. the overall amino acid
sequence of the  xxxg1011xxx  precursor shows significant sequence
homology (about 31%) to that of hgfa {30). interestingly,
the  xxxg1011xxx  precursor is about 100 amino acid residues
shorter than the hgfa precursor. hgfa consists of
characteristic structural domain, a type i and a type ii
fibronectin domains, two egf domains, a kringle domain
and a  xxxg745xxx  domain, while  xxxg1011xxx  consists of three
egf domains, a kringle domain and a  xxxg745xxx

protease would consist of a 50-kda fragment and an about
25-kda fragment corresponding to ne29i-phe537, which
contains an intact catalytic domain.
all cysteine residues contained in three-fourths of the
c-terminal region of the  xxxg1011xxx  precursor are located
virtually identically to those of hgfa with the exception of
cys589 in hgfa (fig. 5). therefore,  xxxg1011xxx  is predicted to
have a similar secondary structure to that of hgfa in this
region. the predicted structural domains in the  xxxg1011xxx 
precursor are shown in fig. 6.  xxxg1011xxx  as well as hgfa is
synthesized as a single peptide precursor, and then may be
converted to a two-chain form of 50- and 25-kda fragments
linked by a disulfide bond. in the case of hgfa activation,
the hgfa precursor is truncated at its n-terminal region,
resulting in the 34-kda active form containing a catalytic
domain. on the other hand, active  xxxg1011xxx  derived from the
precursor may still retain the n-terminal domains through
disulfide-bonded linkages.
the hgf-converting enzyme reported by mizuno et al. is
also a heterodimeric protein, which has similar enzymatic
properties to hgfa {31). but the molecular mass (90 kda)
of the hgf-converting enzyme consisting of 65- and

domain. the n-terminal amino acids of the 50- and 17-kda
fragments of  xxxg1011xxx  correspond to phei and ile29i in the
deduced amino acid sequence, respectively. thus, a mature
form of  xxxg1011xxx  may be produced on proteolytic cleavage of
the peptide bond between  xxxg189xxx ,0-ile29i of a single peptide
precursor. however, the 17-kda fragment is much smaller
than the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid
sequence fromlle29i tophe 6 j 7 of the c-terminus, suggesting
further proteolytic degradation in the c-terminal region of
the fragment. the 17-kda fragment is unlikely to contain
ser.,86, which is essential for  xxxg745xxx  activity as an
active site. it is notable that the peptide corresponding to
phe6<6-lys65i was recovered on digestion of  xxxg1011xxx  with
lysylendopeptidase. therefore,  xxxg1011xxx  should have the
c-terminal region which is absent from the 17-kda fragment, although we could not identify the c-terminal region
as a band on sds-page. we detected weak proteolytic
activity in the  xxxg1011xxx  preparation with iti as a substrate
(data not shown). the weak protease activity of  xxxg1011xxx 
might be explained by the finding that a major portion of
our  xxxg1011xxx  preparation is degraded in the c-terminal
catalytic domain; an active form of  xxxg1011xxx  as a serine

32-kda fragments clearly differs from that of  xxxg1011xxx .
although the function of  xxxg1011xxx  has not been clarified yet,
 xxxg1011xxx  may exhibit its biological functions on binding to ha
in ecm, connective tissue, cartilage, bone marrow, and
synovial fluid. the protease which activates the  xxxg1011xxx 
precursor and the natural substrate of active  xxxg1011xxx  should
be elucidated.
the results of northern blot analysis showed that  xxxg1011xxx 
was expressed in liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. the sizes of the signals, however, varied with the
tissue. in liver, two signals were detected. the band of 3 kb
may correspond to the hgfa-like mrna registered by
kitamura et al. the other band, 2.3 kb, should correspond
to  xxxg1011xxx  mrna. besides the signals detected in liver, a
strong hybridization signal (1.3 kb) was detected in pancreas. this signal is too short to encode  xxxg1011xxx . a large band
(6 kb) was also detected in skeletal muscle. at present, it is
unknown whether these bands reflect an alternatively
spliced form of  xxxg1011xxx  mrna or a cross-hybridized mrna.
regarding the ecm-stabilizing activity of the iti family,
the heavy chains of the family are cleaved and bind to ha
firmly (32-37). however, the enzyme involved in the
cleavage of the heavy chains of the iti family and the
mechanism by which the heavy chains bind to ha tightly
have not been elucidated. although several proteases could
cleave iti (38), and human  xxxg694xxx  cleaved  xxxg2057xxx 
of iti preferentially (39),  xxxg1011xxx  might also be a candidate
of the enzyme concerned in this process, because  xxxg1011xxx 
exhibited ha binding properties and cleaved  xxxg2057xxx  of iti
weakly. further work is needed to elucidate the natural
substrate and the nature of  xxxg1011xxx .
