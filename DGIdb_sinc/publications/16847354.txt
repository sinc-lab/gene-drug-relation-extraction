effect of  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency on glyoxylate metabolism in rats with or without glyoxylate overload.  we examined the effect of  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency on glyoxylate metabolism and hepatic alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt) activity in rats with normal or high glyoxylate intake. male rats were divided into four groups: a control group, a  xxxd3049xxx -free diet group, a glyoxylate water group, and a  xxxd3049xxx -free diet + glyoxylate water group. each group was given special diet (control or  xxxd3049xxx -deficient diet) and drinking water (plain or 0.5% glyoxylate water) for 4 weeks, after which biochemical parameters and hepatic agt mrna level were measured. compared with control rats, the urinary oxalate/creatinine ratio was higher in each of the other 3 groups. the urinary  xxxd2219xxx /creatinine ratio was also higher in the  xxxd3049xxx -free diet group and the  xxxd3049xxx -free diet + glyoxylate water group than the control group, while the urinary glycine/creatinine and citrate/creatinine ratio was lower in both groups. the hepatic agt mrna level was reduced in the  xxxd3049xxx -free diet group, but was increased in the glyoxylate water group than the control group. these results suggest that  xxxd3049xxx  is necessary for glyoxylate metabolism as a coenzyme of agt. especially in the presence of a high glyoxylate intake,  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency leads to severe hyperoxaluria and hypocituria.
