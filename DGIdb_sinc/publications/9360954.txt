these receptors interact with endogenous opioid peptides to
modulate pain-controlling pathways and circuits that modulate
behaviors including mood and reward (2). m opioid receptors
interact with rapidly acting opioid drugs, such as heroin, to
produce marked euphoria and behavioral reward. they are also
primary targets of the slower and longer acting opioids, such as
methadone and laam,1 that represent the best current substitution therapeutics for opiate addiction (3).
m receptors desensitize after repeated stimulation by opioid
agonists, in fashions that display similarities to desensitizing
events noted for other g-protein coupled receptors. agonistinduced m receptor desensitization can be correlated with receptor phosphorylation. m receptors display naloxone-reversible phosphorylation and desensitize after morphine or
damgo treatments (1). both of these agonist-induced events
are insensitive to pretreatments with the protein kinase c
inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx , which inhibits  xxxd2925xxx -induced m
receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.
many opiates and opioid ligands can recognize m receptors
with high affinities. plant-derived alkaloids, synthetic compounds of several classes, and endogenous opioid peptides can
function as agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists with a
range of abilities to induce or block induction of analgesia and
euphoria. however, mutagenesis studies and studies with receptor chimeras support the idea that different receptor features could be involved in recognition of these different ligand
classes (4 – 6). mutations that change naloxone from a full
antagonist to a partial agonist can leave the intrinsic activity of
opioid peptides unchanged, for example see claude et al. (7).
these differences raise the possibility that m receptor occupancies by opioid drugs of different classes could alter the conformation of the m receptor in distinct fashions. some of these
differences could render the receptor an improved or a worse
substrate for kinases and phosphatases and thus directly confer different susceptibilities to phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. alternatively, selective activation of different g-protein classes by different m agonists could trigger different m
receptor phosphorylation and desensitization events.
the current study thus investigates the effects of opioid
ligands of various classes and varying intrinsic activities on m
receptor activation, phosphorylation, and desensitization using
human m receptors expressed in cho cells (hmcho), and the
receptors coexpressed in xenopus oocytes with a g-protein
linked k1 channel. the results support striking parallels between opioid efficacies in opening ion channels and inhibiting

m opioid receptors are subject to phosphorylation and
desensitization through actions of at least two distinct
biochemical pathways: agonist-dependent m receptor
phosphorylation and desensitization induced by a biochemically distinct second pathway dependent on protein kinase c activation (1). to better understand the
nature of the agonist-induced m receptor phosphorylation events, we have investigated the effects of a variety
of opiate ligands of varying potencies and intrinsic activities on m receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. exposure to the potent full agonists sufentanil,
dihydroetorphine,  xxxd2070xxx , etonitazine, and [d-ala2,
mephe4, glyol5]enkephalin (damgo) led to strong receptor phosphorylation, while methadone, l-a-acetylmethadone (laam), morphine, meperidine, dadl, bendorphin(1–31), enkephalins, and dynorphin a(1–17)
produced intermediate effects. the partial agonist buprenorphine minimally enhanced receptor phosphorylation while antagonists failed to alter phosphorylation.
buprenorphine and full antagonists each antagonized
the enhanced m receptor phosphorylation induced by
morphine or damgo. the rank order of opiate ligand
efficacies in producing m receptor-mediated functional
desensitization generally paralleled their rank order of
efficacies in producing receptor phosphorylation. interestingly, the desensitization and phosphorylation mediated by methadone and laam were disproportionate to
their efficacies in two distinct test systems. this generally good fit between the efficacies of opiates in m receptor activation, phosphorylation, and desensitization
supports the idea that activated receptor/agonist/g-protein complexes and/or receptor conformational changes
induced by agonists are required for agonist-induced m
receptor phosphorylation. data for methadone and
laam suggest possible contribution from their enhanced desensitizing abilities to their therapeutic
efficacies.

results

22 compounds, representing each of the major opiate and
opioid classes, produced substantially different effects on m
receptor phosphorylation when tested in receptor phosphorylation assays at screening dose concentrations (1 mm) that were
significantly above their previously reported 0.1–10 nm ki values (table i) (12). when drugs were incubated with hmcho
cells at this concentration for 20 min, dihydroetorphine, sufentanil,  xxxd2070xxx , etonitazine, and damgo caused increased m
receptor phosphorylation producing values 6 – 8-fold above basal levels. methadone, morphine, meperidine, dadl, bendorphin(1–31),  xxxg1801xxx ,  xxxg1722xxx , and dynorphin a(1–17) produced intermediate effects, ;2–5 fold above
basal levels. neither the partial agonist buprenorphine, the
largely k agonists ketocyclazocine and a-neoendorphin, the
mixed agonist/antagonist pentazocine, the mixed k/m agonist
butorphanol, the weak m agonists meperidine and 3-m-hydroxy-5-phenylmorphan, or the m antagonists naloxaonazine
and ly255582 had any robust effect on m receptor phosphorylation. each stimulated phosphorylation levels less than twice
basal levels (fig. 1a-d). phosphorylation was reversible. addition of naloxone to cells incubated with morphine reduced m
receptor phosphorylation levels to close to basal values by 30
min (fig. 2). the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine
extended to its effects on m receptor phosphorylation. 1 mm
buprenorphine blocked m receptor phosphorylation when coincubated with 1 mm concentrations of the fuller m agonists morphine or damgo (fig. 3).

m opioid receptor phosphorylation—phosphorylation of the m opioid
receptor in hmcho (8) was described as (1). briefly, hmcho and nontransfected chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were plated at 80%
confluence in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. cells were incubated at 37 °c for 2 h
with 300 mci/ml of [32p]orthophosphate (8500 ci/mmol; nen life science products) in phosphate-free dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium.
labeled cells were then exposed to various opioid ligands at 1 mm for 20
min or to other treatment times and concentrations as indicated in the
figure legends. ligands and free 32p were removed from cells by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; subsequent procedures
were carried out at 4 °c. cells were solubilized for 60 min with 0.8 ml
of ripa1 buffer (1% igepal ca-630, 0.5% na2  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1%
sds, 5 mm edta, 10 mm naf, 10 mm na2 pyrophosphate, 1 mm okadaic
acid, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml  xxxd302xxx , 10
mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin a in phosphate-buffered saline
buffer). supernatant from a 15 min, 150,000 3 g centrifugation was
preadsorbed by incubation with 100 ml of presoaked protein a-sepharose beads (pharmacia biotech inc.), followed by microcentrifugation. a
sample of this supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by the
bradford method (bio-rad). for immunoprecipitation, 700 ml of the
supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 100 ml of the protein a-sepharose bead slurry and a 1:500 final dilution of an antiserum directed
against the c-terminal 18 amino acids of the m opioid receptor. beads
were washed three times by resuspension with 1 ml of ripa1 followed
by microcentrifugation, and immunoprecipitated proteins then dissociated from beads by extraction with 60 ml of sds-page gel loading
buffer (4% sds, 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 6.8, 5% glycerol, 0.5% 2- xxxd26xxx , and 0.005% bromphenol blue). 20 ml of the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 8% sds-page gels with prestained
molecular mass standards (amersham), and radiolabeled proteins were
identified by autoradiography using hyperfilm-mp (amersham) with
intensifying screens. autoradiographic densities of bands of interest
were quantified by scanning densitometry and normalized to the
amounts of extracted cell protein subjected to immunoprecipitation.

rna quality and sizes were assessed after separations using 1.2%
formaldehyde agarose gels, and full-length rnas were stored in 75%
ethanol at 270 °c. oocytes were isolated from mature female xenopus

0.2% collagenase a, injected with 16 –20 ng of rnas encoding the m
opioid receptor and  xxxg1252xxx  in molar ratios of 3:1, and incubated for 2–3

for efficacies, with two exceptions. methadone and laam each
led to more dramatic receptor desensitization than morphine,

were lower than those of morphine. interestingly, both laam
and methadone treatments led to levels of m receptor phosphorylation greater than those caused by morphine (fig. 5; especially compare responses at 1 mm). this response appeared to
represent a general property of m receptor interactions with
these drugs, and not to depend just on one test system, since
morphine displayed equal efficacy to methadone and greater
efficacy than laam in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase from the
same hmcho cell system in which the m receptor phosphorylation results were obtained (table i).

tion (1, 13, 14). the parallels between ligand efficacy and
desensitization in the current data are consistent with the
relationships between the properties of these opioid ligands in
neurally derived cell lines that endogenously express d opioid
receptors (15). correlations between the efficacies of these opioid ligands in receptor activation and their abilities to cause m
receptor phosphorylation, relationships between receptor desensitization and phosphorylation, and parallels between time
course and dose-response relationships for m receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (1) each support the possibility
that causal relationships could exist among agonist efficacy in
ion channel opening, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.
studies from several laboratories, but not all, have demonstrated desensitization observed in agonist-treated m receptor/
girk coexpressing xenopus oocytes by treatments that alter
levels of kinases including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase c (1, 16, 17). only one report (1)
separated a kinase-dependent pathway from an agonist-induced pathway. kovoor et al. (18), however, interpreted data
from a similar system to suggest that desensitization may not
involve direct receptor phosphorylation. although the results
from the current study do not document direct evidence for m
receptor phosphorylation in xenopus oocytes, the similar patterns of opioid ligand efficacies observed in the xenopus oocyte
and the hmcho systems are totally consistent with the idea
that the mechanisms of receptor desensitization found in these
two distinct test systems are likely to be similar. studies of
phosphorylation and desensitization patterns in receptor mutants with systematic alanine substitutions for individual candidate phosphoacceptor sites will help to add evidence to the
increasingly strong current hypothesis that m receptor phosphorylation is targeted by agonist activation and leads to
desensitization.
the parallels between higher ligand efficacy and enhanced
receptor phosphorylation that suggest that an activated receptor conformation may enhance m receptor phosphorylation have
also been described for b2 adrenergic receptors (19). the data
from methadone and laam, on the other hand, provide highly
interesting exceptions to this general rule. methadone and
laam represent some of the current most effective anti-addiction substitution pharmacotherapeutics (3, 20). although their
long-acting human pharmacologies have been considered important for their therapeutic efficacies (21), detailed studies of
these mechanisms of action have not been carried out. more
prominent receptor phosphorylation and desensitization could
enhance the abilities of both methadone and laam to block
effects of subsequent doses of addictive abused opiates, possibly

contributing to their pharmacological blockade properties and
therapeutic efficacies.
studies of ligand interactions with mutant m receptors suggest that different ligand classes recognize amino acids lying in
different m receptor domains. receptor occupancies by opioid
drugs of different classes might thus alter m receptor conformations in distinct fashions. the ligand-to-ligand differences in
m receptor phosphorylation observed in the present studies
could reflect ligand-to-ligand differences in receptor/ligand conformations that could improve, or worsen its ability to serve as
a substrate for activated kinases or phosphatases. if methadone and laam occupancies produced a m receptor conformation that resulted in better access to kinases without enhanced
efficacy in g-protein activation, for example, its observed differences from morphine could be explained. distinct ligand/m
receptor conformations could also differentially activate different g-proteins. more prominent activation of selected g-pro-

teins by m receptors occupied by methadone or laam could
also conceivably yield more strongly enhanced efficacies in
activating the kinases that lead to receptor phosphorylation
than those that activate ion channels or inhibit adenylyl cyclase, providing another explanation for the observed methadone/morphine differences described here. further experiments that test effects of m receptor mutants and chimeras on
methadone, laam, and morphine affinities and efficacies, as
well as association and dissociation rates for receptor binding,
may provide further evidence to support the relative contributions of each of these mechanisms.
desensitization could represent the inability of m receptors
still expressed on cell surfaces to activate appropriate g-proteins when they bind agonist ligands. removal of m receptors
from cell surfaces to sites where they can no longer transduce
ligand recognition to g-protein activation could also contribute
to the observed patterns of desensitization. there is some cor-

ably, these data will also help to explain the especial therapeutic efficacies of methadone and laam through enhanced abilities to phosphorylate and desensitize the m opioid receptors

relation between desensitization results and the loss of membrane receptors in some expressing cell systems (22). liganddependent opioid receptor internalization has been reported
(23). m receptor internalization in cho cells can be mediated
by opiate agonists in the rank order  xxxd2070xxx  . damgo .
methadone in initial studies.2 however, morphine treatments
provoke no internalization at concentrations up to 10 mm.2 the
time courses for agonist-induced m receptor phosphorylation
are also faster than the reported losses of membrane receptors
(1, 22). receptor dephosphorylation and resensization both
take place within minutes of agonist removal (fig. 2). each of
these lines of evidence suggests significant differences between
the internalization results and the results obtained for phosphorylation and for desensitization. it thus seems unlikely that
internalization contributes to all of the desensitizing effect
observed in the current studies. further studies, including
those using phosphoacceptor site mutants, may well document
which contributions internalization may make to agonist-induced desensization and the role that phosphorylation may
play in each event.
g-protein receptor kinases (grks) readily phosphorylate the
ligand-activated forms of several g-protein coupled receptors
but can find unoccupied or antagonist-occupied receptors poor
substrates (24). desensitization of m receptors, observed in
systems including cho cells, xenopus oocytes, shsy5y cells,
and locus coeruleus neurons (1, 25–28), appears unlikely to
require a kinase of limited distribution. it is conceivable that a
widely distributed member of the g-linked receptor kinase
family, or another broadly-distributed kinase, could be responsible for agonist-induced m receptor phosphorylation. regulation of dephosphorylation could also play a significant role in
the accumulation of phosphorylated receptor species.
the pharmacological profile of m opioid receptor efficacy,
phosphorylation, and desensitization that these data define
documents that phosphorylation and desensitization are widespread consequences of m opioid receptor occupancy by agonists
that include opioid peptides. responses to both exogenous opioids and endogenous opiates are thus both likely to desensitize
through broadly distributed biochemical mechanisms. conceiv-
