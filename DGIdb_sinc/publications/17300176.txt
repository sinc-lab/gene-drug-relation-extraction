abstract:

 xxxg1296xxx  is a member of a large family of catalytically diverse but structurally homologous
pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx ) dependent enzymes known as the aspartate aminotransferase superfamily
or r-family. the homo sapiens and other eukaryotic constitutive kynureninases preferentially catalyze
the hydrolytic cleavage of 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine to produce 3-hydroxyanthranilate and l-alanine, while
l-kynurenine is the substrate of many prokaryotic inducible kynureninases. the human enzyme was cloned
with an n-terminal hexahistidine tag, expressed, and purified from a bacterial expression system using ni
metal ion affinity chromatography. kinetic characterization of the recombinant enzyme reveals classic
michaelis-menten behavior, with a km of 28.3 ( 1.9 µm and a specific activity of 1.75 µmol min-1
mg-1 for 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine. crystals of recombinant  xxxg1296xxx  that diffracted to 2.0 å were
obtained, and the atomic structure of the  xxxd3047xxx -bound holoenzyme was determined by molecular replacement
using the pseudomonas fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  structure (pdb entry 1qz9) as the phasing model. a
structural superposition with the p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  revealed that these two structures resemble
the “open” and “closed” conformations of aspartate aminotransferase. the comparison illustrates the
dynamic nature of these proteins’ small domains and reveals a role for arg-434 similar to its role in other
aat r-family members. docking of 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine into the human  xxxg1296xxx  active site
suggests that asn-333 and his-102 are involved in substrate binding and molecular discrimination between
inducible and constitutive  xxxg1296xxx  substrates.

mammalian  xxxg1296xxx  ( xxxg1296xxx ) is a pyridoxal 5′phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx )1 dependent constitutive (1) enzyme that
catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine
to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and l-alanine (eq 1).

in contrast, prokaryotic inducible kynureninases preferentially hydrolyze l-kynurenine to yield  xxxd189xxx  and
l-alanine. mammalian  xxxg1296xxx  is a member of the
catabolic cascade known as the “kynurenine pathway” (2),
through which the majority of dietary tryptophan is hepatically degraded (3), and provides for the de novo biosynthesis
of nad+ in the absence of niacin (2, 4). in extrahepatic cells,
kynurenine pathway genes are expressed in immune system

cells such as macrophages and microglia, although the
primary metabolite produced in these cells appears to be
quinolinic acid and not nad+ (5, 6). quinolinic acid (qa)
is a known agonist of nmda sensitive glutaminergic
ionotropic receptors (7) and is thus an excitotoxin. qa is a
known necrotic agent of cultured neuron cells (8), and
prolonged exposure causes excitotoxic damage at concentrations 10 times below physiological levels (9). excessive qa
in cns tissues resulting from the overstimulation of the
kynurenine pathway is thought to contribute to the etiology
of many neurodegenerative diseases, including aids-related
dementia complex, alzheimer’s, stroke, epilepsy, and huntington’s disease (10-18). since  xxxg1296xxx  acts at a
metabolic branch point that directs metabolites to the
production of either quinolinate via  xxxg1296xxx  or xanthurenic acid via 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (3),
inhibitors of this enzyme could prevent the overproduction
of quinolinate. thus, inhibitors that specifically target
constitutive kynureninases have potential therapeutic value.
toward this end, the availability of the three-dimensional
structure of human  xxxg1296xxx  is an important step for
rational drug design.
 xxxg1296xxx  belongs to the  xxxd3047xxx  dependent aspartate
aminotransferase superfamily fold (19, 20) (or r-family),
subgroup iva (21). this catalytically diverse group shares a
very low level of sequence identity but retains significant
structural homology (22). only a few amino acid residues
are conserved among all members: (1) the  xxxd3047xxx  enzyme
schiff base forming lysine, (2) an active site aspartate, and
(3) a substrate binding arginine invariantly located on a small

domain beta-hairpin loop (19). in aspartate aminotransferase,
this arginine plays an important role in substrate binding and
catalysis by stabilizing and orienting the substrate within the
active site. also, the small domains of aspartate aminotransferases are known to undergo conformational changes upon
ligand binding (23).
in this work, we report the first cloning, expression,
purification, characterization, and crystallization of homo
sapiens  xxxg1296xxx  (hkyn) using a bacterial expression
system and the atomic structure to 2.0 å resolution.
experimental procedures
protein expression and purification. the h. sapiens
 xxxg1296xxx  was cloned into a pet100 plasmid using a
topota kit (invitrogen) after pcr amplification from a
placental cdna clone obtained from the american type
culture collection (atcc mgc-5080; genbank accession
number u57721) to generate an n-terminal hexahistidine
recombinant protein fusion. the resulting plasmid was
sequenced to confirm the identity with the genbank cdna
sequence. the pcr oligonucleotide primers used for amplification were 5′-gagccttcatctcttgagctgcc-3′
(forward) and 5′-gttgccctagaaaacactgctaa-3′
(reverse). a single colony of escherichia coli bl21(de3)
cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid was inoculated into 1 l of zyp-5052 medium (24) containing 100
mg/l ampicillin and grown at 37 °c for 20 h with shaking
at 300-325 rpm. prior to being harvested, the cultures were
prechilled for 1 h at 4 °c and then collected by centrifugation
at 2500g for 15 min at 4 °c. cell pellets were resuspended
in 30 ml of ice-cold buffer [0.3 m nacl, 0.05 m kpi (ph
7.0), and 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx ] and sonicated for four cycles of 1
min sonication intervals followed by 2 min on ice. cell debris
was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 25000g and 4
°c. the supernatant was allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min followed by the dropwise addition of 4 ml
of a 2% protamine sulfate solution (in resuspension buffer),
and the resultant cloudy solution was centrifuged for 40 min
at 25000g and 4 °c. the supernatant was applied to a nicam (sigma) resin column pre-equilibrated with buffer a
[0.3 m nacl, 0.05 m kpi (ph 7.0), and 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx ] at
a rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °c. after a 1 h wash with buffer
a (1.5 ml/min),  xxxg1296xxx  was eluted from the column
with a 360 min linear gradient from 0 to 100% buffer b
[0.3 m nacl, 0.05 m kpi (ph 7.0), 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx , and 150
mm imidazole, at 4 °c] (0.5 ml/min). sds-page analysis
of fractions eluting from the column was used to determine
appropriate samples to be pooled and concentrated. pooled
fractions were dialyzed for 6 h at 4 °c in a 3.5 l solution
containing 0.1 m kpi (ph 7.0) and 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx  and then
exchanged, via two 10-fold dilutions, into 0.05 m hepes
(ph 5.2) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx  using amicon centriprep
centrifugal filter units (ym-30 membrane). protein concentrations were determined using a bradford (bio-rad) assay
(25).

assays.
crystallization, structure determination, and refinement.
high-throughput crystallization trials were conducted at the
hauptman-woodward institute (26). screenings were performed with an 11 mg/ml  xxxg1296xxx  solution in several
buffers: (1) 30 mm mops (ph 7) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx , (2) 30
mm kpi (ph 7.5) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx , (3) 50 mm hepes
(ph 5.2) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx , and (4) 30 mm mops (ph 7),
0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx , and 10% glycerol.
 xxxg1296xxx  crystals were grown in-house at 23.5 °c
using the microbatch under-oil method (27) by mixing 2 µl
of a 9.2 mg/ml  xxxg1296xxx  solution in 50 mm hepes
(ph 5.2) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx  with 2 µl of 0.05 m mgcl2, 0.1
m tris-hcl (ph 8.0) and 25% peg 3000. crystals were
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with a cryoprotectant containing 0.055 m mgcl2, 0.11 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0), and 33%
peg 3000. x-ray synchrotron data were collected (detector
distance of 200 mm, 200 frames, 1° oscillations, 5 s exposure,
lambda ) 0.97934 å) at advanced photon source sbc-cat
beamline 19-bm in argonne, il (28). data were processed,
scaled, and merged using hkl2000 (29). the merged
scalepack (30) intensities were used as input for the
molrep (31) utility in the ccp4 crystallographic suite (32),
and a suitable molecular replacement solution was identified
using the pseudomonas fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  (pkyn)
[pdb (33) entry 1qz9 (21)] as a model (initial rvalue ) 55.7).
all water molecules, heteroatoms, and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
coordinates were deleted from the molecular replacement
model. the electron density for the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor was used
to evaluate the success of phasing methods. phases of the
highest-scoring molrep solution and the hkyn sequence
were used as input for the automated building package
resolve (34) with default set parameters and no input
model. the highest-scoring resolve solution was refined
with refmac5 (35) in the ccp4 suite with arp/warp (36,
37) automated water addition (3sigma cutoff). refined phases
were subsequently used as input into the arp/warp
automated free atom model building utility in ccp4. two
tandem resolve-arp/warp cycles produced a  xxxg1296xxx  model covering approximately 83% of the predicted
amino acid sequence. manual building of the remainder of
the model and  xxxd3047xxx  docking were carried out with the
xtalview/xfit (38) ccp4 utility, followed by restrained
refinement in refmac5. a final tls refinement was used
with the following residue segments: 6-52, 53-65, 66101, 102-111, 112-134, 135-180, 181-200, 201-252,
253-267, 268-277, 278-285, 286-291, 292-306, 307329, 330-375, 376-391, 392-413, and 414-460. tls
groups were defined on the basis of secondary structure and
were chosen to maximize the improvement in rfree. molprobity (39) and procheck (40) were used to identify errors
during the building and refinement process and evaluate the
quality of the final structure.
structural superpositions and ligand docking. structural
superpositions were determined using the hkyn monomer
as a reference model with strap (41) and the iterative and
magic fit utilities in the swiss pdb viewer (spdbv) (42).
3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine was docked into the hkyn dimer
using the molecular docking algorithm moldock (43) in the
molegro virtual docker. active site cavities were identified

human  xxxg1296xxx  crystal structure
using the molegro van der waals molecular surface prediction algorithm with a grid resolution of 0.5 å.  xxxg1296xxx 
and 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine atoms were defined using the
molegro atom definition tool. the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
was defined as a cofactor, and the protonation and hybridization state of individual  xxxd3047xxx  atoms were defined to correspond
to the internal aldimine dipolar ionic tautomer. all water
molecules were deleted from the model, and hydrogens were
added using the molegro protonation wizard. arg-434 was
modeled to resemble the position of arg-375 in 1qz9 with
xtalview/xfit. side chain atoms of arg-434, asn-333*
(residues having an asterisk are associated with a second
subunit of the dimeric biological unit), ser-75, and the
3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine 2-amino and 3-hydroxyl group were
defined as hydrogen bond donors. the 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine r-carboxylate and gamma-carbonyl groups were defined as
hydrogen bond acceptors. a total of 50 docking runs with a
population size of 200 were calculated over a 15 å radius
surrounding the predicted active site cavity, with a grid
resolution of 0.2 å and a maximum of 5000 iterations per
pose. prepositioned ligands were randomized in the predicted
active site cavity prior to each docking run, and docking was
constrained to the predicted active site cavity.
results
protein purification and kinetic analysis. although
h. sapiens  xxxg1296xxx  was expressed in e. coli cells from
a pet vector under lac control, a pilot expression study
revealed that the addition of iptg or the use of rosetta cells
containing rare trnas did not increase the final yield. also,
a large pellet of insoluble protein, which has the same sdspage molecular weight as the soluble  xxxg1296xxx  fractions, results from each culture. no attempt was made to
resolubilize the insoluble protein pellet. the final yield was
only increased (by 2 mg/l) when zyp-5052 (24) was used
as the growth medium (as opposed to lb broth). the
expression and purification from e. coli yield ∼8.4 mg of
crystallization purity grade protein from a 1 l culture. the
recombinant enzyme has a specific activity of 1.75 µmol
min-1 mg-1, a kcat of 3.5 s-1, a km for 3-hydroxy-dlkynurenine of 28.3 ( 1.9 µm, and a kcat/ km of 2.5 × 105
s-1 µm-1 for 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine.
crystallization. high-throughput screens of  xxxg1296xxx 
in 50 mm hepes (ph 5.2) and 0.2 mm  xxxd3047xxx  yielded two
crystallization conditions that produced two distinct morphologies. crystals grow at a range of ph values in hepes
buffers (5.2-7.5), but the best crystals grow with hepes
(ph 5.2). exchanging the protein buffer from kpi (ph 7.0)
to hepes (ph 5.2) results in a 20-30% loss of protein mass.
 xxxg1296xxx  is subsequently stable for several weeks at
4 °c in 50 mm hepes (ph 5.2) and 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx .
crystallization solutions contained (a) 0.1 m tribasic kpi,
0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0), and 40% peg 4000 and (b) 0.05

model geometry. the final  xxxg1296xxx  model was
refined to 2.0 å with rfree and r values of 0.195 and 0.150,
respectively (see table 1 for model statistics), with 98% of
the cdna predicted amino acid residues (residues 6-460)
fitted to the electron density. an eight-residue segment
between helix h16 and beta-strand s17 (residues 379-386)
could not be modeled due to poor electron density and is
not included in the pdb file. cysteine 45 had additional
electron density protruding from the gamma-sulfur atom which
was modeled as a cysteinesulfenic acid. the structure had
good geometry with rms deviations from ideal bond lengths
of 0.008 å and bond angles of 1.135° with 97.3, 2.5, and
0.2% of the residues in the favorable, generously allowed,
and disallowed regions of the ramachandran plot, respectively (table 1). the conformation of the single residue in
the disallowed region, thr-353, appears to be forced into an
unusual geometry by a strong hydrogen bond (2.50 å)
between its side chain gamma-oxygen and the ala-352 carbonyl
oxygen. electron density is clearly visible between these two
atoms. this residue is located on a three-residue turn that
connects the first (helix h15) and last (helix h16) helices
of the large and small domains, respectively, and has
excellent electron density at contour levels as high as 1.8sigma.
the c2 crystallographic unit cell contained one monomer
per asymmetric unit, with approximately 53% bulk solvent,
and there are 535 water molecules in the final model.
overall fold. the biological dimer (figure 1) can be
generated by applying the crystallographic symmetry operator
1 - x, y, -z to the monomer. monomers are related by a
2-fold rotation axis located at the interface of the large
domains. evaluation of the crystal contacts between molecules revealed only a dimeric  xxxg1296xxx  form; no higher
polymerization forms were identified. each monomer (figure
2) consists of a small domain (residues 9-74 and 354-462)
and a large domain (residues 75-353), which have rbetasandwich and greek key rbetar architecture, respectively. the
large domain is composed of a seven-stranded mixed
beta-pleated sheet with agfedbc topology (beta-strands s5s8, s10, and s11) surrounded by r-helices h8-h14. the
small domain is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel
beta-pleated sheet (beta-strands s17, s18, s20, and s21) with

abed topology surrounded by r-helices h17-h20. the
organization of the secondary structure elements in the small
and large domains is consistent with other  xxxd3047xxx  dependent
r-family members.
important dimerization contacts are provided by (1) a twohelix bundle formed between residues on r-helix h4 and
its 2-fold related counterpart, (2) interactions between
residues on beta-strand s2 and residues on r-helix h4, and (3)
hydrogen bonding between ala-164 and asn-318*, ser-167
and trp-305*, his-142 and val-303*, ser-174 and val-303*.
the active site is formed at the bottom of a large cavity found
at the interface of the large and small domains; it is
amphiphilic in nature and has dimensions of 10 å × 23 å
wide and 16 å deep. the large domain face of the active
site is lined with the hydrophobic side chains of tyr-226,
phe-225, leu-310*, phe-314*, met-316*, trp-305*, and phe165, which form a large hydrophobic patch directly above
the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor. on the opposite side of the active site cleft,
the small domain face contains the charged side chains of
gln-402, asp-426, arg-434, arg-428, and asn-429. the
bottom of the active site is lined with the side chains of ser75 and his-102*.
 xxxd3047xxx  binding site. the electron density returned from the
molecular replacement solution showed continuous density
between the -nitrogen of lys-276 and the 4′-carbon atom
of the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor (figure 3). this observation is consistent
with the presence of an enzyme- xxxd3047xxx  internal aldimine
complex, and follows the observed spectroscopic characteristics of the active enzyme which has a 422 nm absorption
maximum. the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate molecule is stabilized
and properly oriented at the monomer-monomer interface
via extensive hydrogen bonding with residues contributed
by 2-fold related monomer chains (figure 4). hydrogen
bonding between  xxxd3047xxx  phosphate oxygens and the side chains
of residues involved in monomer-monomer contacts (trp305* and ser-167, asn-333* and gly-278, and asn-333*
and tyr-275) coordinates residues from both monomer chains
within the active site.  xxxd3047xxx  oxygens are within hydrogen
bonding distance of atoms of trp-305*, tyr-275, asn-333*,
ser-332*, and thr-138. also, a water bridge appears to
coordinate one of the  xxxd3047xxx  oxygens with the main chain
amide nitrogen of leu-137. the coenzyme pyridine ring is
stabilized via pi-pi stacking interactions with the phenyl ring
of phe-165. phe-165 is conserved in all kynureninases, and

lima et al.
it is likely that these enzymes stabilize the  xxxd3047xxx  pyridine ring
through pi stacking with the side chain of this phenylalanine
residue. the  xxxd3047xxx  pyridine nitrogen is hydrogen bonded with
the side chains of asp-168 and asp-250, which are strictly
conserved among kynureninases. density can be observed
between the delta-oxygen of asp-168 and the  xxxd3047xxx  pyridine
nitrogen. the delta-oxygens of asp-168 and asp-250 share a
strong hydrogen bond (2.59 å), and electron density can be
seen extending between these atoms. aspartate 250 is the
expected conserved aspartate involved in  xxxd3047xxx  binding and
maintaining the  xxxd3047xxx  pyridinium nitrogen protonated (44)
among r-family members. the  xxxd3047xxx  phenolic 3′-oxygen is
stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the his-253 delta-nitrogen
(2.95 å) and the lys-276  xxxd3047xxx  aldimine nh group (zetanitrogen-3′-oxygen distance, 2.58 å). the interactions of
asp-250 and his-253 with  xxxd3047xxx  atoms fix the pyridine ring
as the dipolar ionic tautomer, resulting in the 422 nm
absorption peak. the active site is highly solvated with two
well-ordered water molecules interacting with one of the  xxxd3047xxx 
oxygens, and another with the  xxxd3047xxx  3′-oxygen. also, water
molecules connect active site residues of the large and small
domains through a continuous string of seven waters between
the delta-oxygen and nitrogen atoms of asn-333*, the his-102*
-nitrogen, and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of ser-75,
across the active site cavity and passing directly over the
aldimine nh group toward the his-253 -nitrogen, and
ending at the main chain carbonyl oxygen of phe-225 in the
small domain. four of the water molecules closest to the
side chains of asn-333* and his-102* occupy a large space
in the active site that is devoid of any amino acid side chains.
comparison with the p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx . the
sequence of h. sapiens  xxxg1296xxx  is 26% identical with
that of the p. fluorescens ortholog, and a structural superposition reveals a high level of homology with a 1.2 å2 rmsd
over 317 amino acid residues. human  xxxg1296xxx  has an
additional r-helix (helix h1) that is part of a 25-amino acid
extension at the n-terminus. there are three additional loops
in hkyn: (1) a 14-amino acid loop connecting beta-strand s2
and beta-strand s3 (residues 52-65), (2) a 10-amino acid loop
between helix h11 and beta-strand s7 (residues 191-200), and
(3) a 9-amino acid loop between helix h16 and beta-strand s17
(residues 378-387). for the most part, these extensions are
found exclusively in constitutive  xxxg1296xxx  orthologs.
residues that play a role in stabilizing the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor are
well-conserved. however, residues surrounding the  xxxd3047xxx 
moiety are much less conserved and include the following
variations: thrpkyn-96 to leuhkyn-137, serpkyn-97 to thrhkyn138, thrpkyn-131 to serhkyn-167, glypkyn-281* to serhkyn-332*,
and thrpkyn-282* to asnhkyn-333*. absolutely conserved
active site residues include phe-165, asp-168, asp-250, his253, cys-273, tyr-275, lys-276, arg-434, and trp-305*.
the structural superposition of hkyn with pkyn reveals
differences in the quaternary structures not related to the
primary structures. these high-order variations lie within
elements of the small domain and in a large domain loop
between beta-strands s15 and s16 (residues 310-320), henceforth termed beta-strand s15-s16loop, that extends above the
active site cavity (figure 5). conformational differences in
the small domain are mainly observed in the beta-hairpin
formed by beta-strands s20 and s21. this hairpin, the s20s21 beta-hairpin, contains two arginines conserved among
kynureninases and other r-family members (arghkyn-434 and

arghkyn-428). of these, arghkyn-434 is known to be dynamically and catalytically important in substrate binding and
catalysis (21). the side chain zeta-carbons of these arginines
are separated in the superpositioned structures by 5.9 å
(between arghkyn-434 and argpkyn-375) and 11.18 å (between
arghkyn-428 and argpkyn-369). in hkyn, the side chain of
arg-434 is thoroughly stabilized at the small domain-large
domain interface with hydrogen bonds to the backbone
carbonyls of lys-427 and tyr-226, through a water bridge
to the conserved asp-426, and by a hydrogen bond with the
side chain of arg-428. in pkyn, the arg-375 side chain is
also extensively hydrogen bonded but is instead stabilized
within the active site cavity with hydrogen bonds to asp367 (equivalent to asphkyn-426) and tyr-176, with the  xxxd3047xxx 
aldimine through a chloride ion, and with atoms on a peg
molecule. the pkyn arg-375 guanidino nitrogens are thus
much closer (by 6.5 å) to the  xxxd3047xxx -lys-276 imine bond
than in the hkyn structure.
the hkyn and pkyn s20-s21 beta-hairpins are approximately 11.2° apart if measured from the pkyn  xxxd3047xxx -lys
aldimine. at their maximum separation point, r-carbons
within this beta-hairpin (of the conserved prohkyn-430 and
propkyn-371) are 5.9 å distant (figure 5). behind the s20-

s21 beta-hairpin, residues on helix h17 and beta-strand s18 are
5.8 å away (between r-carbons of prohkyn-410 and propkyn350) from those of their prokaryotic counterparts (figure 5).
also, small domain helices h16 and h18 are each separated
from their prokaryotic counterparts by 2.7 å (between
r-carbons of leuhkyn-371 and leupkyn-320) and 3.7 å
(between r-carbons of ilehkyn-457 and ilepkyn-398), respectively. these conformational changes bring the entire small
domain of the bacterial  xxxg1296xxx  closer to the lys-276plp atoms and large domain active site residues.
large domain residues that line the active site cavity also
exhibit considerable differences between  xxxg1296xxx  crystal
structures. the phehkyn-314 side chain (figure 5) is found
within the active site cavity, 14.8 å from its prokaryotic
counterpart (phepkyn-263), although phepkyn-263 was observed
to have poor electron density in the bacterial structure (21).
here, the side chain of phehkyn-314 forms part of a large
hydrophobic patch directly above the  xxxd3047xxx  moiety with the
side chains of ile-110*, phe-165, trp-305*, phe-306*, and
met-316*. the side chains of arg-313* and met-316* are
7.5 and 5.5 å from their prokaryotic counterparts, respectively (not shown).

each molegro output pose was evaluated on the basis of the
moldock score, protein interaction, hydrogen bonding, and
affinity interaction energies. the pose with the best overall
energy values with these criteria had values of -114.5,
-124.7, -18.9, and -25.8 kj/mol, respectively. this pose
is positioned within the active site cavity with the r-amino
moiety within hydrogen bonding distance of the side chains
of small domain residues arg-434 and ser-75. the aromatic
ring moiety is centered among the side chains of his-102*,
ile-110*, trp-305*, phe-306*, phe-314*, asn-333*, and tyr275 (figure 6). the main chain carbonyl oxygen of ser-75
is also within hydrogen bonding distance of the aromatic
ring 2-amino group, whereas the 3-hydroxy group is within
2.9 å of the asn-333* delta-nitrogen.

previously, the human enzyme was expressed in sf9 insect
cells using a baculovirus expression vector (46) and in cos-1
cells transfected with human  xxxg1296xxx  cdna (47). until
now, its expression has not been reported using a bacterial
expression system. the km values and specific activity for
3-hydroxykynurenine that have been reported for the constitutive forms of  xxxg1296xxx  range from 3 (46) to 49 µm

(47) and from 0.16 µmol min-1 mg-1 for sf9 cells (46) to
5.5 µmol min-1 mg-1 for the enzyme expressed in cos-1
cells (46), respectively. the michaelis constant (km ) 28.3
µm) and specific activity (1.75 µmol min-1 mg-1) of our
enzyme for 3-hydroxykynurenine agree best with that for
the enzyme expressed in cos-1 cells (46). we find this to
be a good indicator that the expression of the human enzyme
in a bacterial system is functionally comparable to that from
a eukaryotic expression system. we also determined the km
of the human enzyme for the bacterial substrate, l-kynurenine, to be 493 ( 46 µm. this agrees well with that reported
for the human enzyme expressed in cos-1 (46) cells. all
of our data were fit with hypero (48), prism (graphpad),
and enzfitter (biosoft) and found to exhibit classical
michaelis-menten behavior, which also contrasts with
reports of sigmoid kinetic behavior from the enzyme
expressed in sf9 cells (47). attempts to fit our data to a hill
equation were unsuccessful. we measured the kinetic properties of a pseudonative enzyme (with the hexahistidine tag
proteolytically removed) and found no change in km and only

a slight loss of activity (<3%). this enzyme had classic
michaelis-menten behavior as well.
like other members of the  xxxd3047xxx  dependent r-family,
 xxxg1296xxx  appears to undergo conformational changes
during catalysis. in this work, we identify two regions in
the small and large domains that could play a role in opening
and closing the active site cavity: the small domain s20s21 beta-hairpin and the large domain s15-s16loop. the s20s21 beta-hairpin in particular emerges as a dynamic region since
a structural superposition between hkyn and the structures
of pkyn (pdb entry 1qz9), 2-aminoethylphosphonate transaminase (pdb entry 1m32) (49),  xxxg1562xxx  (pdb entry 1jf9)
(50), cystathionine beta-lyase (pdb entry 1ibj) (51), csdb (pdb
entry 1i29) (52), alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (pdb
entry 1h0c) (53), histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (pdb
entry 1fg3) (54), maly (pdb entry 1d2f) (55), serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (pdb entry 1bj4) (56), and 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (pdb entry 2ch2) (57) reveals
that the difference in the s20-s21 beta-hairpin conformational
states observed between kynureninases is also clearly visible
with other members of the r-family (figure 7). on the basis
of the structural superposition, it appears that the conformation of the conserved arg-434 in hkyn is a function of the
positioning of the small domain, in particular that of the
s20-s21 beta-hairpin. furthermore, the conformational changes
required to position the hkyn s20-s21 beta-hairpin, arg-434,
and small domain elements closer to active site residues (thus
resembling the structures of 1qz9) would be very similar to
the movements observed between aspartate aminotransferase
open (pdb entry 1ama) (58) and closed (pdb entry 9aat)
(59) states. although the small domains of kynureninases
and aspartate aminotransferases do not superimpose well,
in part due to a difference in length between the small and
large domain linker r-helix (32 residues in aspartate aminotransferase vs 21 residues in  xxxg1296xxx ), the relative
motion that must be undertaken by the entire small domain
is very similar between the aat open/closed and pkyn/hkyn
pairs (figure 8). even though the small domain movements
in aspartate aminotransferase are much more pronounced, it
is possible that neither the pkyn structure nor the hkyn
structure demonstrates a fully closed/open state, but rather
an intermediate between them. thus, the investigation of new
 xxxg1296xxx  conformational states presents an interesting
avenue of research. it is also possible that the second crystal
morphology of  xxxg1296xxx  crystals grown in solution a
might contain this different conformational state. it is
important to note that these conditions would require some

optimization to produce crystals with desirable diffraction
properties.
the two  xxxg1296xxx  structures taken together suggest
that the arghkyn-434/argpkyn-375 side chain is dynamic near
the vicinity of the  xxxd3047xxx  aldimine bond. this conserved residue
plays an important role in the substrate binding and catalysis
of other  xxxd3047xxx  r-family members. site-directed mutagenesis
studies with aspartate aminotransferase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase have shown that this residue is
important for both substrate specificity and regulation of the
conformational changes that accompany substrate binding

in these enzymes. arginine to lysine mutants of serine
hydroxymethyltransferase have a 15-fold reduction in affinity
and 0.03% of the wild-type catalytic activity (60). arginine
to alanine mutants do not bind substrate or have catalytic
activity (61). also, aspartate aminotransferase arginine to
aspartate mutants have catalytic properties that are several
orders of magnitude lower than those of the wild type (23).
the structural superposition between these  xxxg1296xxx 
orthologs also suggests that it is reasonable to presume that
arg-434 is involved in substrate binding as well. human
 xxxg1296xxx  crystals shatter within seconds of exposure to
a mother solution containing 100 µm 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine. thus, we speculate that substrate binding causes a
conformational change that breaks crystal contacts and causes
these crystals to shatter. this conformational change is likely
to be initiated by an interaction between the substrate’s
r-carboxyl group and the arg-434 guanidino nitrogens,
which is seen in aspartate aminotransferase (62). this is an
important step in the closure mechanism since aspartate
aminotransferase arginine to alanine mutants cannot adopt
fully closed conformational states (62). subsequently, the
aromatic ring of the substrate can occupy an amphiphilic
pocket near the  xxxd3047xxx  moiety between the charged side chains
of ser-75, his-102*, tyr-275, and asn-333* and the
hydrophobic side chains of ile-110*, phe-306*, phe-314*,
and trp-305* (figure 6). substrate binding within the active
site would tether the s20-21 beta-hairpin and, consequently,
the rest of the small domain to the large domain through the
side chain of arg-434 and stabilize the closed state until
product release. the binding of substrate to both small and
large domain residues would place a certain amount of strain
on substrate bonds which would be released as the substrate
is cleaved. in this way, the large and small domains act as
a spring-loaded catalytic unit that puts strain on the substrate
bonds and facilitates hydrolysis. the docking of 3-hydroxyl-kynurenine in the  xxxg1296xxx  active site reveals that
substrate r-carboxylate oxygens are likely to form hydrogen
bonds with the side chain of arg-434. the docking also
suggests that the 2-amino and 3-hydroxyl moieties of the
substrate are likely to be within hydrogen bonding distance
of atoms on asn-333*, ser-75, and his-102* and in a
favorable distal quadrupole pi-pi stacking interaction with
the side chain of the conserved trp-305*. several atoms in
the  xxxg1296xxx -3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine docking solution
occupy the positions of atoms on a peg molecule found in
the active site of 1qz9 (not shown). the moldock docking
algorithm positions the r-nitrogen of 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine

lima et al.
asnhkyn-333* and the smaller hishkyn-102* side chains form
an environment in human  xxxg1296xxx  that would allow this
group (3-hydroxyl) to interact favorably with their side chains
and not be sterically hindered (by trp-69* in pkyn).
interestingly, these two point mutations are conserved among
constitutive and inducible kynureninases, with inducible
kynureninases having a thr-trp pair, whereas constitutive
orthologs contain the asn-his pair. on the basis of these
deductions, we have designed site-directed mutagenesis
experiments to determine whether these residues play a role
in substrate binding and specificity.

as required for formation of the 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine
external aldimine, which is the first intermediate in the
 xxxg1296xxx  catalytic mechanism (63). 3-hydroxy-lkynurenine is also properly oriented such that the r-carbon
can be properly protonated by lys-276 (21) in subsequent
catalytic steps to form the appropriate product enantiomer
(l-alanine). also, the position of the top-scoring docking pose
from our calculations is oriented within the active site in a
fashion similar to that of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutanoic
acid in the crystal structure of anopheles gambiae 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (pdb entry 2ch2) (57) (superimposed figure in the supporting information). in both
cases, r-carboxylate atoms are near small domain residues,
whereas the hydrophobic ring moiety is anchored on the large
domain side of the active site cavity.
inducible kynureninases preferentially catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of kynurenine, which is not hydroxylated
at the 3′-position. on the other hand, constitutive orthologs
preferentially utilize 3-hydroxykynurenine as a substrate. at
present, there is a poor understanding of the molecular basis
of the discrimination process between these two very similar
molecules. the problem is further complicated by the fact
that these enzymes have active sites that are highly conserved. many of these conserved residues are found near
the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor, and there are currently
no substrate or inhibitor  xxxg1296xxx  complex crystal
structures to help identify residues involved in substrate
differentiation. it is thus difficult to predict with certainty
which residues convey molecular specificity. however, a
structural superposition of the docked hkyn-3-hydroxy-lkynurenine structure with pkyn reveals contacts that can aid
in directing experiments aimed at identifying these residues
(figure 9). specifically, the trppkyn-69* side chain phenyl
group and the gamma-carbon of thrpkyn-282* form a hydrophobic
patch that is unfavorable for hydrogen bonding with the
3-hydroxyl moiety of 3-hydroxykynurenine. these groups
are more suitable for accommodating the kynurenine 3′methyne carbon. on the other hand, the delta-nitrogen of
