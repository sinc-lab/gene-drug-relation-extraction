abstract

introduction

androgenic disorders offemale skin such as hirsutism,
acne and alopecia are etiologically caused by androgen
excess. skin 5a-reductase activity is a major factor
influencing the manij2station of endogenous androgen
excess in women. oral contraceptives have proven us&l
f o r the treatment of androgen disorders of the skin.
the mechanisms of action by which oral contraceptives
correct skin androgen levels may include inhibition of
5a-reductase and  xxxg183xxx  activity. w e investigated the inhibitory efect of oral contraceptive progestins
and  xxxd2054xxx  on skin 5a-reductase and their
injluence on  xxxg183xxx  activity and ajinity, using
three dgerent in vitro assay systems. it was shown that
 xxxd2753xxx  blocked 5a-reductase activity with an ic50
value of iopm, followed by levonorgestrel ( i c ~ o
52 pm), dienogest (ic.50
55 pm),  xxxd1786xxx 
(ic5o 8 7 p m ) and gestodene (ic50 9 8 p m ) . to
determine thefull androgenic potential ofthe progestins,
 xxxg183xxx  binding ajinities and activation
potentials were determined. the progestins  xxxd2753xxx 
and dienogest in particular combined 5a-reductase
inhibition with minimal androgenicpotential.these data
demonstrate that the progestins  xxxd2753xxx  and
dienogest might help in the treatment of clinical
hyperandrogeny in women.

exaggeration of peripheral androgen metabolism
and elevated  xxxd3240xxx  (dht) concentration are etiological factors in the pathophysiology of acne, hirsutism and androgenic
alopecia. the clinical manifestations associated
with hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism and
acne, are disturbing to most patients and there are
serious health risks associated with these conditions, including cardiovascular disease, intravascular thrombosis, insulin resistance and
polycystic ovary syndrome’. risk reduction strateges include the use of oral contraceptives with low
androgenic progestins2 which suppress gonadotropin secretion and reduce circulating androgens3.
in many androgen-responsive organs, such as
skin and the prostate, androgenic responses are
elicited mainly by dht4. reduction of testosterone to d h t is catalyzed by the enzyme
5a-reductase5. two isoforms of 5a-reductase have
been characterized, which differ in michaelis
menten constants and ph requiremend. the
presence of both isoenzymes was demonstrated for
a number of tissues including the central nervous
system, the urogenital tract, the respiratory tract,
the gastrointestinal tract, skin and the endocrine

system'. i n clinical studies finasteride, a potent
5a-rcductase type 2 inhibitor, suppressed circulating iiht beyond 70% and led to improvements in
wonicn suffering from hirsutisni and acne8-"'.
the effect of the recently introduced progcstogens on inhibition of 5a-rcductase are unknown.
the knowledge about progestin binding to the
 xxxg183xxx  and thereby inducing androgenic or antiandrogenic effects is based mainly on
animal experiments". we investigated the 5areductase inhibitory potential of a variety of
progestins in human skin homogenate. furthermore, the androgenic properties of the progestins
were examined by analysis of the binding affinities
to the  xxxg183xxx  and the effects on  xxxg183xxx  activity.

materials and methods
preparation of skin tissue
human skin tissue biopsies were obtained from 30
healthy women (age 18-26 years) undergoing
breast reductions. underlying fat tissue was carefully removed. the skin tissue was homogenized
and pulverized with a dismembrator. a nuclear
pellet was prepared by centrifugation of the
homogenate at 1500 g for 15 min. the pellet was
resuspended in sorensen phosphate buffer (1:15
 xxxd2987xxx  phosphate/l :15 disodium phosphate, ph 7.0). the enzyme suspension was frozen
in aliquots at -8ooc.

measurement of 5a-reductase activity
enzyme activity was investigated by measuring the
percentage production of 5a-dht from the substrate testosterone. the optimal standard mixture
contained 0.25 mg/ml protein tissue, 1 p m
''c-testosterone (59.8 mci/mmol) and 500 p m
nadph and was incubated for 40 min. the synthetic hormones were added in concentrations of
1, 5, 10,25 and 50 pm. the reaction was stopped
by the addition of cold ethylacetate. extraction of
the organic compound was followed by evaporation under vacuum. the steroids were separated by
silica-gel chromatography in chloroform/acetone
(185/15). the radioactive spots were identified
and quantitated by tlc scanning. for each steroid
hormone tested, the inhibitor concentration at half
maximal enzyme activity was determined (ic~o).

224

this parameter allows direct coniparison of the
inhibitory potential of different substrates. each
experiment contained untreated controls (maximal
conversion rate of 1 pm testosterone in d h t
equals 100% 5a-reductase activity). the inhibitory
potential was always determined in relation to the
controls. the experiments were carried out in triplicates and values are expressed as means & standard
deviation (sd).

transfection of cells and reporter gene
analysis
the androgenic profile of the progestins was
evaluated in vitro by transactivation assays. the
hormone-dependent transcriptional activation can
be analyzed in cell culture by transfection of the
steroid receptor and a reporter gene linked to a
hormonally responsive promoter. cos-1 cells
were co-transfected with psvhar'* and the
luciferase reporter plasmid aretk-luc13 using
lipofectin reagent (life technologies inc,
rockville, md, usa). the transfected cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of hormones ( xxxd2751xxx , levonorgestrel,  xxxd2754xxx ,
 xxxd2067xxx , gestodene, dienogest,  xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx ,  xxxd2054xxx 
and finasteride) for 24 h. as the steroid hormones
were dissolved in ethanol, controls were cultured
in the appropiate ethanol concentration (0.1%).
for the reporter gene assay, the transfected cells
were harvested, disrupted and cellular extracts
were prepared. protein concentrations of the cell
extracts were determined according to the procedure of bradfordt4. luciferase activity was
measured as previously de~cribed'~.

androgen-receptor binding assay
forty-eight hours after transfection of the human
androgen-receptor expressing vector in cos-1
cells, the cells were harvested by scraping and
resuspended in 10 mm tris-c1, ph 7.0, 1 mm
edta, 250 mm sucrose, 12 mm  xxxd2668xxx . the binding assay was performed
according to the method described by neubauep.
the cells were homogenized by sonification and
centrifuged at 100000 g for 45 min. the pellet was
resuspended in 10 mm tris-c1, ph 7.0, 1 mm
edta, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm sodium
molybdate. aliquots were incubated with 0.5 nm

10, 100, 1000 and 10000-fold molar excess of
non-radioactive mibolerone, dht, testosterone
and steroid hormones. reaction tubes were incubated for 20 h a t 4°c. after addition of dextran-coated charcoal (50 mm tris, 1.5 m m
edta, 1% dextran-coated charcoal, 0.1% gelatin),
bound and free steroids were separated by vortexing, incubation for 30 min and centrifugation.
samples were analyzed using a liquid scintillation
counter. competitive binding activity data were
expressed as percent of control measured in
samples incubated in the absence of non-radioactive competitor.

results
inhibition of 5a-reductase in vitro
the progestins  xxxd2751xxx , levonorgestrel,
 xxxd2754xxx ,  xxxd2067xxx , gestodene, dienogest,  xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx  and the
estrogen  xxxd2054xxx  as well as finasteride were

analyzed for porential inhibitory effects on skin
5a-reductase. 5a-reductase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of 1 p m
14c-testosterone to 5a-dht in human skin
homogenate. the synthetic hormones were added
in concentrations of 1,5,10,25 and 50 pm. figure
1 shows that none of the progestins inhibited
5a-reductase activity completely.  xxxd2753xxx 
reached 50% inhibition at a concentration of
10 p m (ic50).estimated icso
values were 52 p m
for levonorgestrel and 55 p m for dienogest. for
 xxxd1786xxx  and gestodene the ic50 values
were delineated as 87 and 98 pm. for  xxxd2754xxx ,
 xxxd2751xxx  and  xxxd2067xxx , ic50 values
were higher than 100 pm. as a positive control,
finasteride with an ic50 value of 1 p m is shown.
the estrogen  xxxd2054xxx  did not have any
inhibitory potential.

discussion
oral contraceptives (oc) have proven useful
for the treatment of androgenic disorders.
the most obvious action of estrogen-progestin
oral contraceptives o n hyperandrogeny is an antigonadotropic effect, which lowers ovarian androgen secretion”. it is still unclear at present whether
oral contraceptives are also active in reducing
hyperandrogenism through inhibition of 5areductase activity and/or  xxxg183xxx 
activity18. based mainly o n animal experiments,

some progestins have been shown to have androgenic or antiandrogenic effects”.
the aim of our study was to investigate the
potential of oc progestins and  xxxd2054xxx  to
inhibit skin 5a-reductase activity. to characterize
the full androgenic potential, the effects on  xxxg183xxx  activity and the  xxxg183xxx 
binding affinities were examined. w e performed a
broad characterization of the androgenic profile of
synthetic hormones using three different in vitro
assay systems.
dht is the most biologically active androgen
in skin. it is metabolized from testosterone by
the enzyme 5a-reductase20. inhibition of 5areductase has been proven useful in the treatment
of hirsutism, acne and alopecia in female
in addition to a variety of synthetic
non-steroidal and steroidal inhibitors, there is
evidence that progesterone is a competitive
~.
there have
inhibitor of 5 a - r e d ~ c t a s e ~however,
been only a few reports demonstrating such
activity with synthetic progestins, and all these
studies have been performed with genital skin25,26.
the androgen metabolism and 5a-reductase
enzyme pattern of genital skin does not reflect the
situation in non-genital skin, such as facial and
scalp skin, whereas skin from the breast exhibits a

gynecological endocrinology

similar andogen pattern and 5a-reductase activity
to facial and scalp skin (unpublished data).
in our in vitro model using breast skin,  xxxd2753xxx  showed 50% inhibition of 5a-reductase
at a concentration of 10 pm. this effect is in the
range of finasteride (ic50 1 pm). in men receiving
finasteride (5 mg/day orally) for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia it causes an approximately 50% reduction in chest hair growth2’. in
balding stumptail macaques, a monkey model of
male pattern baldness, it induces hair regrowth28
and it has beneficial effects on baldness in young
men and female idiopathic h i r s ~ t i s m ~ ~ -these
~’.
results and our finding that a progestin has inhibitory effects on 5a-reductase in vitro provide
evidence for the usefulness of progestins in the
treatment of hirsutism and male-pattern baldness in
women.
in our studies, levonorgestrel, dienogest,  xxxd1786xxx  and gestodene had ic50 values
between 52 and 98 pm. o u t of all progestins
tested, only  xxxd1786xxx  has already
been reported to inhibit skin 5a-reductase
activity31. in our assay,  xxxd2054xxx  did not
influence 5a-reductase activity. in genital skin
tissue, 17p-estradiol has been shown to inhibit
5a-reductase only at high concentration^^^. these

data suggest that estrogens appear not to be a major
factor influencing 5a-reductase activity.
it has been reported that progestins can exert
androgenic activity33.to get more insight into the
pharmaceutical potential ofthe different progestins
it has been necessary to characterize their androgenic profile. in most studies, the androgenicity of
synthetic steroids is analyzed with animal experiments, by evaluating their effects on the weight of
the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate and levator
ani muscle of the rat, or chick comb
another approach is the measurement of
p-glucuronidase, ornithine carboxylase and
 xxxg110xxx  activities in mouse kidney
in response to androgen admini~tration~~”’.
in such bioassays some progestins displayed
significant androgenic activity. d- xxxd2754xxx ,
lynestrenol and norethynodrel stimulated
p-glucuronidase activity in female balb-c mice
sixfold”. levonorgestrel increased the weight of
seminal vesicles and prostate gland in juvenile
castrated rats two- to threefold and had about
10-fold greater androgenic potency than norg e ~ t i m a t e ~although
~.
not directly comparable,
these animal data agree with our results which
demonstrate 1.6-5-fold activation of the androgen
receptor reporter gene by  xxxd2754xxx  and levonorgestrel at the physiological concentration of 1 nm.
 xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx , dienogest and
 xxxd2067xxx  showed weak agonistic effects
only at high concentrations (> 10 nm).
gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx  have been
characterized by animal studies and transactivation
assays. in castrated rats, seminal vesicle weight was
increased by a 10-fold higher dose of gestodene
and a 30-fold higher dose of  xxxd2067xxx 
than testosterone p r ~ p i o n a t e in
~ ~contrast
.
to the
difference between gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx  in in vivo experiments, cat (chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase) reporter gene data
showed an equal increase of 2.5% upon treatment

of transfected cells with 1 nm gestodene or
3-keto-desoge~trel~~’.in our experimental
approach, gestodene exhibited the strongest
agonistic potential whereas  xxxd2067xxx 
failed to transactivateour luciferase reporter gene.
we used a competitive receptor binding assay
to analyze a possible correlation between the biological effects measured and receptor binding aftinities of the various progestins. our experiments
show that strong binding affinity directly correlates
with activation of receptor function in the case of
 xxxd2751xxx , levonorgestrel,  xxxd2754xxx  and
gestodene. conversely,  xxxd2067xxx , dienogest and  xxxd2753xxx  did not activate androgen
receptor activity significantly and showed only low
receptor affinities.  xxxd1786xxx  has a binding affinity comparable to  xxxd2751xxx  and
testosterone but is unable to activate receptor
activity. this behavior might contribute to the
reported antiandrogenic action of cyproterone
acetate41.furthermore, the data show that receptor
affinity studies alone are not sufficient to predict
agonistic behavior. for the characterization of a
unique progestin it seems necessary to investigate
the effect-on receptor transactivation activity.
our results agree with data from juchem et ~ 1
and phillips et ~ 1 . ’who
~ showed that the relative
binding affinities (relative to the reference compound  xxxd2631xxx ) decrease in the following order:
gestodene, levonorgestrel,  xxxd2067xxx  and
 xxxd2753xxx . our experiments further show that
gestodene and levonorgestrel have even higher
binding affinities than testosterone. although all
sex steroids have the same basic structure, relatively
minor structural modifications can cause dramatic
alterations in biochemical activity.
in summary,  xxxd2753xxx  and dienogest were
shown to have the most promising profile in terms
of inhibitory potential on 5 ~ r e d u c t a s eand low
 xxxg183xxx  activity for application to the
therapy of hyperandrogenism in women.
