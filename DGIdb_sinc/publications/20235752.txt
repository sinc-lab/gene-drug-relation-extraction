abstract
the inhibitory effects of some drugs on 6- xxxg1733xxx  from human erythrocytes have
been investigated. for this purpose, initially, erythrocyte 6- xxxg1733xxx  was purified
3364 times in a yield of 58% by using ammonium sulfate precipitation and 2’,5’-adp sepharose 4b affinity gel. a
temperature of +4°c was maintained during the purification process. enzyme activity was determined with the
beutler method by using a spectrophotometer at 340 nm. this method was utilized for all kinetic studies. many
commonly used drugs were investigated in this study. some drugs (ketotifen (ki: 8.3 ± 1.7 mum),  xxxd1796xxx  (ki:
10.1 ± 0.7 mum),  xxxd2561xxx  (ki: 50.9 ± 13.2 mum), furosemide (ki: 127 ± 37.8 mum), methotrexate (ki: 136.7 ± 25.3 mum),
metochloropramide hydrochloride (ki: 2.1113 ± 0.6979 mm),  xxxd3130xxx  hydrochloride (ki: 6.0353 ± 1.2783 mm), and
 xxxd2171xxx  (ki: 73.4 ± 21.9 mm)) inhibited enzyme activity in vitro. ki constants for the enzyme were found
by means of lineweaver–burk graphs. all drugs showed non-competitive inhibition. in addition, ic50 values of the
drugs were determined by plotting activity percent vs [i].

introduction
6- xxxg1733xxx  (e.c.1.1.1.44;  xxxg1733xxx ),
the third enzyme in the pentose phosphate metabolic pathway, catalyzes the conversion of 6-pga ( xxxd593xxx ) and nadp+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate) to d-ribulose-5-phosphate and nadph, which
protects the cell against oxidizing agents by producing
 xxxd2213xxx  (gsh)1,2. nadph is also a coenzyme
participating in the synthesis of a number of biomolecules
such as  xxxd2154xxx , steroids, and some amino acids3,4. in the
case of lack of nadph, the concentration of gsh in living
cells declines, resulting in cell death. gsh is indirectly produced by  xxxg1733xxx ; therefore,  xxxg1733xxx  can be defined as an indirect antioxidant enzyme4,5. many agents are known to activate or inhibit enzymes in vitro and in vivo6–9, so affecting
metabolic pathways. inhibition of  xxxg1733xxx  leads to decreased
nadph and gsh, which will cause cell damage especially
in older erythrocytes, resulting in some problems in living
cells6–8.
the effects of many commonly used drugs (netilmicin
sulfate,  xxxd454xxx ,  xxxd143xxx , isepamycin, chloramphenicol,
ceftazidim, teicoplanin, ampicillin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin,

 xxxd455xxx ,  xxxd2871xxx ,  xxxd2193xxx , ciprofloxacin,
cefozin, decefin, streptomycin, combisid,  xxxd2578xxx , larnoxicam, metronidazole, imipenem, ornidazole, vancomycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin) on  xxxg1733xxx  enzyme
activities have been investigated10,11. however, no reports
could be found in the literature on the effects of ketotifen,
 xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , furosemide, methotrexate, metochloropramide hydrochloride,  xxxd3130xxx  hydrochloride, and
 xxxd2171xxx  on human erythrocyte  xxxg1733xxx , although
 xxxd228xxx  has been reported to stimulate  xxxg1733xxx  in vitro and
in vivo10.
this study was aimed at the purification of human
erythrocyte  xxxg1733xxx , and determination of the effects of
some commonly used drugs on human red blood cell
 xxxg1733xxx  activity.

activity determination
 xxxg1733xxx  activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 25°c
as described by beutler12. briefly, the enzyme sample was
added to a 1 ml (final volume) incubation mixture containing 0.1 m tris-hcl + 0.5 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(edta) (ph 8.0), 10 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm nadp+, and 0.6 mm
6-pga, and the increase in absorption at 340 nm due to the
reduction of nadp+ was measured at 25°c. one enzyme
unit represents the reduction of 1 µmol of nadp+ per min at
25°c, ph 8.0.

(ph 6.0) and 25 ml of a buffer of 0.1 m k-acetate and
0.1 m k-phosphate (ph 7.85). washing continued until an
absorbance of 0.05 at 280 nm was obtained. elution of the
enzyme was carried out with a mixture containing 80 mm
k-phosphate, 80 mm kcl, 5 mm nadp+, and 10 mm edta
(ph 7.85). enzyme activity was measured in all fractions,
and the activity-containing fractions were pooled, then
dialyzed in 50 mm k-acetate + 50 mm k-phosphate buffer
(ph 7.0) for 2 h with two changes of buffer. all procedures
were performed at 4°c11.

preparation of hemolysate
fresh human blood samples were collected in tubes containing edta, then centrifuged (15 min, 2500 × g), and the
plasma and buffy coat (leukocytes) removed. the packed
 xxxd187xxx  were washed three times with kcl (0.16 m), hemolyzed with five times the volume of ice-cold water, and then
centrifuged (4°c, 10,000 × g, for 30 min), to remove the ghosts
and intact cells11.

protein determination
the protein content in all samples was quantified spectrophotometrically at 595 nm according to bradford’s method13,
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

ammonium sulfate precipitation
the hemolysate was subjected to precipitation with ammonium sulfate (gradient 35–65%). enzyme activity was determined both in the supernatant and in the precipitate for
each respective precipitation. the precipitated enzyme
was dissolved in phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 7.0), and
gave a clear solution which contained partially purified
enzyme11.
purification of  xxxg1733xxx 
the ammonium sulfate fraction (35–65%) of the hemolysate
obtained as above was loaded onto a 2’,5’-adp sepharose
4b affinity column and the flow rate was adjusted to
20 ml/h. the column was then sequentially washed with
a 25 ml buffer of 0.1 m k-acetate and 0.1 m k-phosphate

sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
enzyme purity was examined using laemmli’s procedure14
with 3% and 8% acrylamide concentrations for running and
stacking gel, respectively. bovine albumin (66,000), chicken
ovalbumin (45,000), and bovine carbonic anhydrase
(29,000) were used as standards (sigma: mw-sds-200) (see
figure 1).
in vitro effect of drugs
in order to determine the effects of some drugs on human
 xxxg1733xxx , concentrations of ketotifen (0.0018–0.0282 mm),
 xxxd1796xxx  (0.0049–0.054 mm),  xxxd2561xxx  (0.02–
0.285 mm), furosemide (0.03–0.6 mm), methotrexate
(0.036–0.55 mm),
metochloropramide
hydrochloride
(0.83–8.335 mm),  xxxd3130xxx  hydrochloride (1.54–15.4 mm),
and  xxxd2171xxx  (24.99–249.935 mm) were added
to the reaction mixture and the enzyme activity was measured. an experiment in the absence of drug was used as
control (100% activity). the ic50 values were obtained from
activity (%) vs. drug concentration plots (for example
figure 2). in order to determine the ki values, the substrate (6-pga) concentrations were 0.006, 0.012, 0.024,
0.036, 0.048 mm for ketotifen,  xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx ,
furosemide, methotrexate, and 0.003, 0.006, 0.012, 0.024,

discussion
it is known that many drugs have adverse effects on the
body when used for therapeutic or other purposes16 which
may be dramatic and systematic17. a good example is that
of pamaquine used for malaria treatment, which caused
severe adverse effects in patients within a few days, resulting
in black urination, hyperbilirubinemia, a dramatic decrease
in blood hb levels, and finally death, which occurred in
cases of severe g6pd ( xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase) deficiency18. therefore, investigation of the effects of
some drugs on the enzyme activity of human erythrocyte
 xxxg1733xxx  is very important.
here, human erythrocyte  xxxg1733xxx  enzyme was purified
with a 58% yield and 3364-fold purification in 5–6 hours
using 2’,5’-adp sepharose 4b affinity gel chromatography (table 1). sds-page showed that high purity for the
enzyme had been obtained (figure 1). the inhibitory
effects of some drugs on  xxxg1733xxx  activity in humans have

inhibition of human erythrocyte 6- xxxg1733xxx    479
been reported in several investigations9–11. for example, it
has been reported that netilmicin sulfate,  xxxd454xxx ,  xxxd143xxx , isepamycin, chloramphenicol, ceftazidim, teicoplanin, ampicillin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin,  xxxd455xxx ,
 xxxd2871xxx ,  xxxd2193xxx , ciprofloxacin, cefozin,
decefin, streptomycin, combisid,  xxxd2578xxx , larnoxicam,
metronidazole, imipenem, ornidazole, vancomycin,
clindamycin, and amoxicillin inhibit human erythrocyte
6pgd10,11, and that ampicillin and  xxxd143xxx  inhibit rat redcell 6-pga9. however, to the best of our knowledge, the
inhibitory effects of the drugs examined here on human
erythrocyte  xxxg1733xxx  have not been studied. in order to show
the inhibitory effects, while the most suitable parameter
is the ki constant, some researchers use the ic50 value9,10.
therefore, in this study, both the ki and ic50 parameters
of these drugs for  xxxg1733xxx  were determined. ic50 values of
ketotifen,  xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , furosemide, methotrexate, metochloropramide hydrochloride,  xxxd3130xxx 
hydrochloride, and  xxxd2171xxx  were 0.0084, 0.0120,
0.0550, 0.1250, 0.1420, 3.2700, 3.6600, and 209.10 mm,
respectively. ki constants of ketotifen,  xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , furosemide, methotrexate, metochloropramide
hydrochloride,  xxxd3130xxx  hydrochloride, and  xxxd2171xxx  were 8.3 ± 1.7 mum (non-competitive), 10.1 ± 0.7
mum (non-competitive), 50.9 ± 13.2 mum (non-competitive),
127 ± 37.8 mum (non-competitive), 136.7 ± 25.3 mum (noncompetitive), 2.1113 ± 0.6979 mm (non-competitive),
6.0353 ± 1.2783 mm (non-competitive), and 73.4 ± 21.9 mm
(non-competitive), respectively (table 2). in this study, the
drugs inhibited  xxxg1733xxx  activity, compared with the control
group. the drugs can cause non-competitive inhibition
by binding to other sites affecting the three-dimensional
structure of the enzyme20.
the ki constants show that ketotifen had the highest
inhibitory effect, followed by  xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx ,
furosemide, methotrexate, metochloropramide hydrochloride,  xxxd3130xxx  hydrochloride, and  xxxd2171xxx . the
ic50 values showed the same trend. from this investigation,
by using the obtained ki and ic50 values, undesirable side
effects of these drugs on  xxxg1733xxx  activity and body metabolism and fatty acid synthesis can be reduced. according to
these data, if it is required to administer ketotifen,  xxxd1796xxx , and  xxxd2561xxx  to patients, their dosage should be
very well controlled to decrease hemolytic and other side
effects due to possible inhibition of  xxxg1733xxx .
