interactions between h1-antagonists and opioids:
a drug discrimination study
received: 10 september 1996 / final version: 27 december 1996

abstract we previously demonstrated that combination of opioids, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, with
the histamine h1-receptor antagonists  xxxd3443xxx 
and chlorpheniramine could enhance their rewarding
e¤ects in rats. in the present study, the e¤ects of combined treatment with opioids and h1-antagonists on
discriminative stimulus e¤ects were examined in rats
trained to discriminate between cocaine (10 mg / kg) or
morphine (3.0 mg / kg) and saline, since it is believed
that discriminative stimulus e¤ects of abused drugs are
related to their rewarding e¤ects.  xxxd3443xxx  and
chlorpheniramine, but not pentazocine or dihydrocodeine, generalized to the discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of cocaine. pentazocine (3.0 mg / kg) and dihydrocodeine (5.6 mg /kg) signiþcantly potentiated the
cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of low doses
of  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine, respectively.
on the other hand, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine,
but not  xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, generalized to the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine.
neither 1.0 or 3.0 mg /kg  xxxd3443xxx  nor chlorpheniramine a¤ected the morphine-like discriminative
stimulus e¤ects of pentazocine and dihydrocodeine,
respectively. these results suggest that the potentiation
of the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of h1antagonists by opioids may be involved in the enhanced
rewarding e¤ects of combinations of opioids and h1antagonists.

introduction
the taking of several drugs simultaneously by
drug abusers is becoming common. the abuse of combinations of  xxxd3443xxx , a histamine h1-receptor
antagonist, and pentazocine, a mixed opioid agonistantagonist (ts and blues), by heroin addicts is well
established (lahmeyar and steingold 1980; poklis and
whyatt 1980; debard and jagger 1981). on the other
hand, in japan, the abuse of over-the-counter cough
syrups, which usually contain active ingredients including dihydrocodeine (l-opioid receptor agonist) and
chlorpheniramine (h1-antagonist), has been spreading
among adolescents (tani et al. 1984; ueyama et al.
1984), and is becoming a serious social issue due to its
consequence of petty crime.
many investigators have sought to characterize the
interaction between these opioids and h1-antagonists
in animals. for example,  xxxd3443xxx  potentiates the
antinociceptive activity of pentazocine (tagashira et al.
1984a; yeh 1985), and does not potentiate the ability
of pentazocine to inhibit morphine withdrawal signs in
rodents (tagashira et al. 1984b). chlorpheniramine
suppressed the development of physical dependence to
(suzuki et al. 1988) and the acute toxicity (kase et al.
1978) of dihydrocodeine. furthermore, we previously
demonstrated that the combination of opioids, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, with the h1-antagonists
 xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine, respectively,
could enhance the rewarding e¤ects of opioids using a
conditioned place preference paradigm in rats (suzuki
et al. 1990, 1991a). nevertheless, the pharmacological
basis of the interaction between these drugs is unclear.
the drug discrimination procedure has been used to
clarify a drugs internal state based on its discriminative stimulus e¤ects and to characterize the interactions
between psychoactive drugs, and it is believed that discriminative stimulus e¤ects of abused drugs are related
to their rewarding e¤ects. the e¤ects of h1-antagonists
on discriminative stimulus e¤ects and other behavioral

347

e¤ects of opioids are well characterized in animals
(shannon and su 1982; shook et al. 1984; sanson et al.
1986; leza et al. 1991; suzuki et al. 1996). furthermore,
we recently demonstrated that  xxxd3443xxx  and
chlorpheniramine have cocaine-like discriminative
stimulus e¤ects in rats (suzuki et al. 1996). therefore,
in the present study, we examined the e¤ects of pentazocine and dihydrocodeine on the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of  xxxd3443xxx  and
chlorpheniramine, respectively, in rats trained to discriminate between 10 mg /kg cocaine and saline. on the
other hand, previous studies have demonstrated that
l-opioid receptor agonists generalized to the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine (shannon and
holtzman 1976, 1979), while pentazocine completely
generalized or partially generalized to the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine in animals (shannon
and holtzman 1976, 1979; shannon and su 1982;
shook et al. 1984). in the present study, the e¤ects of
pentazocine and dihydrocodeine alone in combination
with  xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, respectively,
were also examined in rats trained to discriminate
between 3.0 mg / kg morphine and saline.

materials and methods
sixteen male fischer 344 rats (charles river japan, atsugi, japan)
were maintained at 200230 g (80% free-feeding weight). water was
available ad libitum for all of the rats in their home cages. the rats
were housed in individual cages at a room temperature of 22 ± 1°c
with a 12 -h light-dark cycle (light on 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.).
these studies were conducted in accordance with the guide for
care and use of laboratory animals adopted by the committee
of care and use of laboratory animals of hoshi university which
is accredited by the ministry of education, science, sports and
culture of japan.

apparatus
experiments were conducted in operant-conditioning test chambers
(model gt8810; ohara & co., ltd, tokyo, japan) equipped
with two levers, with a reinforcement cup mounted midway between
the levers. white lamps were installed above each of the
levers. chambers were enclosed within sound- and light-attenuating boxes and supplied with white noise to mask extraneous
sound. reinforcement consisted of a 20-mg food pellet (ohara &
co.).

discrimination training
discrimination training was performed according to the method
described by suzuki et al. (1994). brießy, before they were trained
to discriminate between morphine or cocaine and saline, all rats
were trained to press a lever. training began under a þxed-ratio
(fr 1) reinforcement schedule in which the rat was presented with
a food pellet each time it pressed a lever. when reinforcement was
provided, the light above the lever was illuminated. after the
response rates had stabilized, the fr requirement was increased
steadily to a reinforcement schedule of fr 10. after the response
rates had stabilized under fr 10 and the rat had received 40 rein-

forcements during four consecutive sessions, the rats were divided
into two experimental groups. one group of rats (n = 8) was trained
to discriminate between morphine (3.0 mg /kg) and saline. injection
of morphine or saline was administered sc 30 min before each session. another group of rats (n = 8) was trained to discriminate
between cocaine (10 mg / kg, ip, 15 min before the start of the session) and saline. fifteen-minute sessions were conducted once a
day, according to a double alternation schedule [sddssddssd
(d = drug, s = saline)]. discrimination training was continued until
all of the rats met the required criterion [during þve consecutive
training sessions, at least 83 % of the responses that occurred before
the þrst reinforcement (frf) were made on the correct lever (i.e.,
frf ≤ 12)].

testing procedure
after the animals had attained the criterion, dose-response, generalization and combination tests were initiated; test sessions
were performed only when frf ≤ 12 for at least three consecutive
discrimination training sessions. during the test session, rats
were placed in the operant box until they had made ten responses
on either lever or 5 min had elapsed. in the dose-response test,
rats were tested for lever selection after the administration of
various doses of cocaine or morphine. in generalization tests,
various doses of pentazocine, dihydrocodeine,  xxxd3443xxx 
or chlorpheniramine were tested instead of the training drugs.
in the combination test, in rats trained to discriminate between
cocaine and saline, þxed doses of pentazocine or dihydrocodeine
that produced less than 20 % cocaine-lever responses in the generalization tests, or saline, were administered in combination with
 xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, respectively. on the other
hand, in rats trained to discriminate between morphine and saline,
þxed doses of  xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, or saline were
administered with morphine and pentazocine or dihydrocodeine,
respectively. the pretreatment times and doses of drugs used were
15 min for 1.25 10 mg /kg cocaine; 30 min for 0.3 3.0 mg / kg
morphine, 1.0 17 mg / kg pentazocine, 1.0 10 mg / kg dihydrocodeine, 0.310 mg /kg  xxxd3443xxx  and 0.3 10 mg / kg chlorpheniramine.

drugs
 xxxd1736xxx  (takeda pharmaceutical industries, osaka,
japan), morphine hydrochloride (sankyo, tokyo, japan),  xxxd3443xxx  hydrochloride (sigma, st louis, mo., usa), chlorpheniramine maleate (sigma), pentazocine (socegon injection; yamanouchi pharmaceutical tokyo, japan) and dihydrocodeine
(sankyo) were dissolved in saline and injected in a volume of
1.0 ml/ kg.

data analysis
during the training sessions, accuracy was deþned as the number
of correct responses as a percentage of the total responses before
the þrst food pellet. during the test sessions, performance was
expressed as the number of drug-lever responses as a percentage of
the total responses upon completion of fr 10. drugs were considered to have generalized to the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of
cocaine or morphine if more than 80 % of the responses were on
the drug lever. response rate (responses /min) was also evaluated
during the test sessions. the response rate was calculated by dividing the total number of responses made on either lever by the time
(min) to complete the þrst ratio. further, in rats that made fewer
than ten responses before 5 min had elapsed, responding was considered to be disrupted and the data obtained were not included in
the calculations. the e¤ects of pretreatment with saline or drugs on

the dose-response or dose-generalization curves were compared
using a two-factor (groups × dose) repeated measures analysis of
variance (anova). the paired students t-test was used to compare the percentage of drug-lever responding or response rates during the combination test.

rats required approximately 21 sessions to acquire the
cocaine-saline discrimination and approximately 20
sessions to acquire the morphine-saline discrimination.
once rats attained the criterion, drug-saline discrimination stabilized and was maintained with a high degree
of accuracy. during the dose-response tests, cocaine
(1.25 10 mg /kg) and morphine (0.3 3.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate
responses and the training dose of cocaine or morphine
engendered more than 80 % drug-appropriate responses
in all of the rats (fig. 1).
in the generalization tests,  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine produced cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects (fig. 2). on the other hand, pentazocine
(1.0 17 mg / kg) and dihydrocodeine (1.0 10 mg/kg)
did not generalize to the discriminative stimulus e¤ects
of cocaine (fig. 2). two out of eight rats showed a disrupted response at the highest dose of pentazocine.
pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, but not  xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, completely generalized to
the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine, and the
response rates decreased as the dose was increased
(fig. 3).
in the combination tests, 3.0 mg / kg pentazocine,
but not 1.0 mg / kg, signiþcantly shifted the dosegeneralization curve of  xxxd3443xxx  to produce
cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects to the left
[f (1,56) =8.85, p < 0.01], and both 1.0 mg/kg and
3.0 mg / kg signiþcantly potentiated the cocaine-lever
responding to  xxxd3443xxx  at doses of 1.0 and/or
1.7 mg / kg compared to pretreatment with saline
(fig. 4a). furthermore, 5.6 mg / kg dihydrocodeine

chlorpheniramine at doses of 1.0 and 1.7 mg/kg as
compared to pretreatment with saline (fig. 4b). on the
other hand, pretreatment with 3.0 mg / kg  xxxd3443xxx  or 3.0 mg / kg chlorpheniramine did not a¤ect
the discriminative stimulus e¤ects at any dose
(0.33.0 mg / kg) or the dose-response curve of morphine, compared to pretreatment with saline (tables 1
and 2). furthermore, pretreatment with 1.0 and
3.0 mg / kg  xxxd3443xxx  and 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg
chlorpheniramine did not a¤ect either the morphinelike discriminative stimulus e¤ects at any dose of pentazocine
(1.0 10 mg /kg)
or
dihydrocodeine
(1.0 10 mg / kg), respectively, or the dose-generalization curves to pentazocine and dihydrocodeine for the
discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine, respectively, compared to pretreatment with saline (tables 1
and 2). the response rates during all of the combination tests were not di¤erent from those in combination
with drug or saline at any dose.

in the present study, we found that pentazocine and
dihydrocodeine can potentiate the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of  xxxd3443xxx  and
chlorpheniramine, respectively, and that  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine do not a¤ect the morphine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of pentazocine
and dihydrocodeine. on the other hand, these opioids
and h1-antagonists themselves induce rewarding e¤ects
(suzuki et al. 1990, 1991a; unpublished observation),
like morphine and cocaine. furthermore, we previously
demonstrated that the combination of opioids, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, with h1-antagonists,

 xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine, respectively,
enhances their rewarding e¤ects in a conditioned place
preference paradigm in rats (suzuki et al. 1990, 1991a).
these results suggest that the e¤ects of opioids on the
cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of h1-antagonists, rather than the e¤ects of h1-antagonists on the
morphine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of opioids, may be involved in the enhancement of rewarding e¤ects in the combination of opioids and
h1-antagonists, since it is believed that discriminative
stimulus e¤ects of abused drugs are related to their
rewarding e¤ects.
it is not yet clear why the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of h1-antagonists are potentiated
by opioids. a wide range of evidence suggests that
although cocaine inhibits the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, the dopaminergic (especially the mesolimbic) system plays the primary role in

the discriminative stimulus e¤ects (cunningham et al.
1992) and rewarding e¤ects (spyraki et al. 1987;
hubner and moreton 1991) of cocaine. both  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine, as well as cocaine, can
inhibit the neuronal uptake of dopamine in synaptosomes (tuomisto and tuomisto 1980; shishido et al.
1991; oishi et al. 1994). furthermore, we recently
demonstrated that the psychostimulant-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine are, at least in part, mediated by the
dopaminergic system (suzuki et al. 1996). on the other
hand, some behavioral e¤ects of pentazocine are suppressed by dopamine receptor antagonists, suggesting
that activation of the dopaminergic system may be
involved in the e¤ects of pentazocine (ukai et al. 1989;
hudzik and slifer 1990), while it has been shown that
l-opioid receptor agonists increase the release of
dopamine from nerve terminals using a microdialysis

351

procedure (di chiara and imperato 1988). the
dopamine-releasing e¤ect of l-opioid receptor agonists
might be potentiated by inhibitors of dopamine uptake
(heikkila et al. 1975; koe 1976; masukawa et al. 1993;
suzuki et al. 1995a). thus, it is conceivable that
dopaminergic actions of pentazocine and dihydrocodeine are involved in their ability to enhance the
cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine.
several reports have indicated that h1-antagonists
stimulate the central nervous system in animals when
given alone (barnett et al. 1984; iorio et al. 1986;
sansone et al. 1986). h1-antagonists increase the
response rate under þxed-interval schedules of either
food presentation or shock avoidance in squirrel monkeys (mckearney 1982, 1985; bergman and spealman
1986, 1988). in the present study,  xxxd3443xxx  and
chlorpheniramine generalized to the discriminative
stimulus e¤ects of cocaine. these results corroborate
previous results that some h1-antagonists have psychostimulants-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects in
animals (evans et al. 1989; suzuki et al. 1996) and suggest that  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine themselves may have psychostimulant-like abuse potential.
in the present study, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, but not  xxxd3443xxx  or chlorpheniramine, generalized to the discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of morphine. these results agree partly with previous results in rats (shannon and holtzman 1976,
1979; shannon and su 1982; shook et al. 1984; nishida
et al. 1989). furthermore, neither  xxxd3443xxx  nor
chlorpheniramine potentiated the morphine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, respectively. these þndings contrast with
previous results that opioid-induced hyperlocomotion
or place preference is potentiated by certain h1-antagonists (sansone et al. 1986; suzuki et al. 1990, 1991a;
leza et al. 1991; masukawa et al. 1993). thus, the
mechanisms of discriminative stimulus e¤ects of opioids might di¤er from those of hyperlocomotion or
rewarding e¤ects.
the activation of l-opioid receptors could modify
the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens,
which is a terminal region of mesolimbic dopaminergic system (di chiara and imperato 1988; spanagel
et al. 1990) and could induce some behavioral e¤ects
(e.g. rewarding e¤ects and locomotion), which may be
mediated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic system
(suzuki et al. 1991b; funada et al. 1993; meyer and
meyer 1993; narita et al. 1993). nevertheless, the role
of dopaminergic mechanisms in discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine remains unclear. neither the
d1-receptor antagonist sch23390 nor the d2-receptor
antagonist haloperidol produces reliable attenuation of
the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine (higgins
et al. 1994; suzuki et al. 1995a). furthermore, we previously demonstrated that the rewarding e¤ects of morphine are mediated by l2-opioid receptors (suzuki et al.

1993), while the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine are mediated through l1-opioid receptors
(suzuki et al. 1995b). in addition, the dopamine-releasing e¤ects of morphine from the dopaminergic nerve
terminals is regulated by l2-opioid receptors
(pasternak and wood 1986). thus, it is conceivable that
the dopaminergic system is less involved in the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of morphine than in its
rewarding e¤ects, which may explain in part the present þnding that the discriminative stimulus e¤ects of
opioids, unlike their rewarding e¤ects, were not potentiated by stimulant-like h1-antagonists.
previous studies have demonstrated that the morphine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of pentazocine
can be potentiated by  xxxd3443xxx  in rats (shannon
and su 1982; shook et al. 1984); these results are inconsistent with the present results. the degree of generalization of pentazocine to the discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of morphine may explain these discrepant
results. for example, in the present study, pentazocine
completely generalized to the discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of morphine, while in other studies pentazocine
alone failed to generalize to these e¤ects of morphine
(shannon and su 1982; shook et al. 1984). thus, the
degree of the morphine-like discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of pentazocine may play an important role in
determining the e¤ects of pentazocine in combination
with  xxxd3443xxx .
in conclusion, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine
potentiated the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus
e¤ects of  xxxd3443xxx  and chlorpheniramine, respectively, while these h1-antagonists did not a¤ect the morphine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of these
opioids. these results suggest that potentiation of the
cocaine-like discriminative stimulus e¤ects of h1-antagonists by opioids may be involved in the enhancement
of rewarding e¤ects by combinations of opioids and
h1-antagonists.
