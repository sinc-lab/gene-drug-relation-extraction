purification and properties of calmodulin from phymatotrichum omnivorum.  mycelia of phymatotrichum omnivorum obtained  xxxd1891xxx  day intervals during 10 to 50 days of growth were used for isolating calmodulin, and studying its effect on glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase,  xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase and ca++atpase. glycogen synthase was inhibited until the 30th day by calmodulin, whereas calmodulin obtained from the 40th day stimulated glycogen synthase activity and the 50th day sample had no effect. camp phosphodiesterase and ca++atpase of p. omnivorum were stimulated by the respective calmodulin. molecular weight of the purified fungal calmodulin was approximately 18 kd as revealed by  xxxd3215xxx  gel electrophoresis.  xxxd3431xxx ,  xxxd1869xxx  and lidocaine inhibited calmodulin activity and calmodulin activation of pde, respectively.
