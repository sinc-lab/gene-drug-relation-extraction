summary. candida albicans, the most important
opportunistic fungal pathogen, is able to generate
remarkable amounts of reactive oxygen species
(ros). since ros are highly cytotoxic, this
mechanism may contribute to the pathogenicity of
this yeast, including its invasiveness and the
inflammatory response of the host.  xxxd3314xxx , a
synthetic antifungal agent of the allylamine class,
inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of
 xxxg2197xxx . furthermore, there is evidence
that  xxxd3314xxx  at therapeutic concentrations can
be considered a free radical scavenger in vitro and
could exert an anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. in
this study we investigated whether  xxxd3314xxx 
affects the generation of ros by c. albicans.
blastoconidia of the c. albicans strain 3153a were
cultured in yepg-medium and, subsequently,
incubated with different doses of  xxxd3314xxx  (1, 10
and 100 lg ml)1) for 10 and 60 min, respectively.
ros generation was measured by lucigeninenhanced chemiluminescence. formation of ros
was considerably dependent on cell number.
chemiluminescence signals were measured at a

amplified. in conclusion,  xxxd3314xxx  reduced the
ability of c. albicans to generate ros. besides the
known effect on ergosterol biosynthesis, this mechanism may contribute to its antifungal action.

introduction
candida albicans is the most important opportunistic
fungal pathogen. the yeast is able to cause
candidosis, a disease that can vary from superficial
mucosal complaints to life-threatening systemic
disorders. several virulence factors of c. albicans
are known, including dimorphism, which is the
ability to grow in either a yeast-like (blastoconidial)
or a mycelial (hyphal) form in response to different
environmental factors [1]. the argument that
hyphae represent an advantage in tissue invasion
seems obvious and widely accepted, but definitive
experimental evidence is lacking [2].
reactive oxygen species (ros) have received
increasing attention as short-acting compounds
involved in inflammation and tissue damage.
ros may react with polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
in cellular membranes, nucleotides, and sulfhydryl
bonds in proteins [3], and they have been related to
the tissue injury in yeast infections [4].
the mitochondria in c. albicans are capable of
generating extracellularly released ros [5]. in our
previous work we demonstrated that ros generation by c. albicans is dependent on morphogenesis
and that their highest levels are found in cells with
hyphal form [6]. thus, ros generation may play a
major role in tissue invasion and infection.
 xxxd3314xxx , a synthetic allylamine antifungal
agent, inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of
 xxxg2197xxx . when exposed to  xxxd3314xxx ,
fungi accumulate squalene while becoming deficient
in ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell
membranes. the inhibition of  xxxg2197xxx 
leads to fungistatic and fungicidal actions. although
earlier studies suggested that  xxxd3314xxx  had less
activity against candida species, the clinical efficacy of
 xxxd3314xxx  in cutaneous candida infections has been
proven [7].  xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated good
activity against some azole-resistant c. albicans
strains, and could therefore be a useful therapeutic
option in cases of severe superficial candida infections.
furthermore, there is evidence that, at therapeutic concentrations,  xxxd3314xxx  can be considered a
free radical interceptor in vitro and could exert an
anti-inflammatory activity in vivo [8]. the substance
is capable of interacting with cell membranes and
inhibiting the generation of ros [9, 10].
in this study, the effect of  xxxd3314xxx  on ros
generation by c. albicans was analysed. we

investigated whether  xxxd3314xxx  influences the
oxidant properties of this pathogen.
materials and methods
candida albicans strain 3153a was cultured on
sabouraud glucose (4%) agar (bag, lich,
germany). cultures were prepared in yeast extract
peptone glucose (yepg) medium to obtain yeast cells
(blastoconidia) in the stationary phase by incubating
for 21 h at 25 c. samples at a concentration of
1 · 106 cells ml)1 to 1 · 109 cells ml)1 were
prepared in saline and yepg medium. candida cells
at a concentration of 1 · 108 cells ml)1 were
incubated in saline with  xxxd3314xxx  (novartis,
nürnberg, germany) at concentrations of 1 lg ml)1,
10 lg ml)1 and 100 lg ml)1 dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (dmso; merck, darmstadt, germany).
incubation was performed for 10 min and 60 min at
25 c in a shaking incubator. the duration was
restricted to exclude effects of  xxxd3314xxx  on cell
number and growth, which had been studied prior to
the experiment.
ros measurements were carried out using
lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence as described
before [11]. lucigenin solution (n,n ¢-dimethyl-9,9¢biacridinium dinitrate; fluka, buchs, switzerland)
was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline at a
concentration of 0.1 mmol l)1 and 200 ll fungal cell
suspension was measured in the tube luminometer
lb 953 (berthold, wildbad, germany). chemiluminescence signals were recorded for yeast cells at
different cell numbers and for 1 · 108 cells ml)1
incubated with  xxxd3314xxx  using the slow kinetic
method. the calculation was performed using
the average counts per minute (c.p.m.) over
measurement periods of 20 min.
all data were expressed as means ± standard
deviation. data were analysed using analysis of
variance (anova) for multiple comparisons.
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
results
generation of ros was detectable in c. albicans
blastoconidia. the results were dependent on yeast
cell number and on media used for measurement.
chemiluminescence signals could be found at
concentrations ‡ 1 · 106 cells ml)1 of c. albicans
blastoconidia. the maximum was measured at concentrations > 1 · 108 cells ml)1 (fig. 1). at higher
concentrations, ros generation was inhibited in
both media, which is likely to be a protective
mechanism. the media used for measurements
strongly affected the total amounts of ros.

dependent on the  xxxd3314xxx  concentration used.
at a  xxxd3314xxx  concentration of 1 lg ml)1 (t 1)
the inhibition was 9.4% and at 100 lg ml)1
(t 100) it was 24% (fig. 2a).
the inhibition was significant when the control
incubated with dmso and the highest chosen
 xxxd3314xxx  concentration of 100 lg ml)1 (t 100)
were compared (p < 0.05).
after 60 min of incubation with  xxxd3314xxx  the
inhibition was amplified. the final inhibitory effect
was 18% for 1 lg ml)1  xxxd3314xxx  (t 1) and 41.1%
for 100 lg ml)1  xxxd3314xxx  (t 100) (fig. 2b). the
effect was significant for  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations
of 10 lg ml)1 (t 10) and 100 lg ml)1 (t 100)
(p < 0.05).
discussion

measurements in saline revealed the highest values,
which could be explained by the lack of nutrients in
this solution and the resulting stress within the cells.
furthermore, yepg medium presumably possesses
light-quenching effects in chemiluminescence measurements [6, 12]. due to these results, further
experiments were carried out with blastoconidia at
a cell number of 1 · 108 cells ml)1 in saline.
after 10 min of incubation with  xxxd3314xxx  a
dose-dependent inhibition of ros generation was
already measurable. dmso itself as the soluble
reagent revealed antioxidant properties. however,
the inhibition of ros generation was considerably

 xxxd3314xxx , a synthetic allylamine antifungal
agent, possesses antioxidant properties. camera
et al. demonstrated that at therapeutic concentrations  xxxd3314xxx  can be considered a free radical
interceptor in vitro and could exert an antiinflammatory activity in vivo [8]. the in vitro
properties of the drug could be related to its
chemical structure.  xxxd3314xxx  possesses one
double and one triple bond, conjugated where an
adduct can be formed following exposure to ros.
furthermore, this agent is capable of interacting
with cell membranes and, thus, inhibiting the
generation of ros [9, 10]. naftifine, another

inhibitory effect of  xxxd3314xxx 

antifungal drug of the allylamine class, has been
reported to inhibit chemiluminescence and superoxide anion production of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes [13, 14].
as we demonstrated in our previous work,
c. albicans is able to generate significant amounts
of ros [6] but this ros generation is dependent
on the morphological form of the yeast. the
formation of hyphae, usually acknowledged as a
major virulence factor in candida pathogenicity, was
shown to be associated with markedly increased
ros formation. ros generation was not closely
linked to the ability to form hyphae, but was highest
in germinative cells.
in this study, the effects of  xxxd3314xxx  on the
generation of ros by c. albicans were investigated in the yeast phase. the results reveal a
time- and dose-dependent inhibition of ros
generation by c. albicans. after 10 min incubation
with 100 lg ml)1  xxxd3314xxx  a significant reduction
of ros was measured (p < 0.05). after 60 min a
significant reduction of ros formation was
demonstrated with a  xxxd3314xxx  concentration of
10 lg ml)1 (1%) which corresponds to the dose
applied for topical preparations [7].
due to this time-dependency it is likely that not
only radical scavenging properties but also an
interaction with the generation of ros is responsible for the  xxxd3314xxx -induced inhibition. the
remarkable increase of the inhibitory effect after
60 min suggests an inhibition of the ros generation within the candida cells.
in summary,  xxxd3314xxx  reduces the generation
of ros by c. albicans. besides the known
influence on ergosterol biosynthesis, this mechanism may contribute to an antifungal action and
could exert an anti-inflammatory effect within the
host.
further investigations are needed to prove
whether  xxxd3314xxx  inhibits the generation of
ros as well in the hyphal phase, which is
associated with markedly increased ros generation.
