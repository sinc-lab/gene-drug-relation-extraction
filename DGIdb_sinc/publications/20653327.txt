implications for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus

abstract

preventing morbidity and mortality from diabetes mellitus is of paramount importance as the incidence
of this disease is increasing across the world. while microvascular complications of diabetes such as
nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy are reduced with intensive glycemic control, treatment of hyperglycemia has not been consistently shown to have effects on the macrovascular complications of diabetes
such as coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. preventive efforts have accordingly shifted toward the modification of other cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. agonism of
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) has long been an attractive target for antidiabetic
therapy due to the role of ppars in glycemic control and lipid metabolism. ppar-g agonists such as
rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are used in clinical practice for the treatment of diabetes, and there is some
evidence that pioglitazone may have positive effects on cardiovascular complications by virtue of its
favorable effects on lipid profiles. however, they have not been shown to reduce macrovascular events.
ppar-a agonism is the mechanism of action in the fibrate class of medications; these agents have been
shown to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) levels, reduce triglyceride levels, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. given the prevalence of lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes, dual
ppar-a/g agonists (glitazars) could potentially benefit patients with diabetes. a phase ii trial examining a
novel dual ppar agonist,  xxxd106xxx , showed that therapy with this agent reduced hyperglycemia and
favorably modified levels of hdl-c and triglycerides with an acceptable safety profile.  xxxd106xxx  is
currently being studied in large-scale clinical trials to assess whether it will reduce the risk of major
cardiovascular endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) among patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease. if ongoing studies confirm the theoretical benefit and safety of dual ppar-a/g agonism,  xxxd106xxx  may become the first therapy demonstrated to reduce macrovascular complications in
patients with diabetes.

1. introduction
diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of disorders
linked by the inability to properly regulate glucose that is increasing in both incidence and importance. type i diabetes
predominantly affects children and young adults and is characterized by the inability of pancreatic islet cells to provide
adequate levels of insulin. patients with type ii diabetes have
peripheral insulin resistance resulting in impaired insulin secretion and excessive hepatic glucose production.[1] while the
incidence of type ii diabetes in childhood is increasing, the
onset of type ii diabetes classically occurs in adult patients with

central obesity. the prevalence of diabetes increases with age
and currently affects one-fifth of the world’s population.[2] the
incidence of diabetes is greatest in the pacific rim and countries
with western lifestyles; however, the incidence of diabetes is
increasing across the world as obesity, western diet and lifestyle, and inactivity become more common.[3]
the mechanism behind the development of complications in
patients with diabetes is not fully understood but numerous
hypotheses have been developed. the most commonly accepted
hypothesis is that chronic hyperglycemia results in the formation of advanced glycosylated products that in turn promote
atherosclerosis. this hypothesis is supported by evidence that

the majority of complications from diabetes are long-term sequelae related to the duration of hyperglycemia.[4]
the vascular system is disproportionately affected by diabetes at both the macrovascular (coronary, cerebral, and
peripheral arterial disease) and microvascular (neuropathy,
nephropathy, and retinopathy) levels. diabetes has been consistently shown to increase the risk for development of coronary
artery disease and is defined by the american heart association as one of the major risk factors for heart disease.[5] while
there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of
cardiovascular events over the past 30 years,[6] diabetes has
actually increased in importance as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular events during this period.[7]
this article examines the evidence for glycemic control,
discusses the risk factors for the development of diabetesrelated adverse events, and highlights the therapeutic potential
of  xxxd106xxx  in the treatment of patients with diabetes.

2. intensive glucose control
glycemic control has long been thought to be paramount to
the prevention of diabetic complications. this hypothesis was
first tested in the dcct (table i gives full trial names of trial
acronyms used in this article), which randomized 1441 patients
with type i diabetes to either intensive or conventional diabetes
management. patients in the intensive glycemic control arm
were treated with insulin administered either by a pump or three
or more injections per day in order to achieve the goals of
intensive therapy including preprandial blood glucose concentrations between 70 and 120 mg/dl (3.9 and 6.7 mmo/l) and
postprandial concentrations of less than 180 mg/dl. patients in
the intensive glycemic control group had significantly better
glycemic control with an average glycosylated hemoglobin

(hba1c) of 7.3%, while individuals in the standard group had
an average hba1c of 9.1%. while there was a significant reduction in microvascular events, there was no difference in
macrovascular events between the two groups.[8] the glycemic
control hypothesis of diabetes was further tested in patients
with type ii diabetes in the ukpds, which randomized 3867
patients with newly diagnosed type ii diabetes to either an intensive or a conventional diabetic regimen. patients in the intensive glycemic control group achieved a hba1c of 7.0% while
patients in the conventional group had a hba1c of 7.9%; this
difference was statistically significant. as in the dcct,
intensive glycemic control was effective in reducing microvascular events by 25%; however, the 16% reduction in the
relative risk of myocardial infarction was not statistically significant. in addition, there were no differences in the incidence
of either death or stroke after a median of 10 years’ follow-up.[9]
recently, several trials examining the efficacy and safety of
intensive glycemic control in patients with diabetes have been
published that have resulted in considerable debate regarding
the role of this strategy. the accord trial was designed to
test a strategy of intensive glycemic, bp, and lipid control in
patients with diabetes and either known coronary artery disease
or significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. 10 251
patients were randomized to treatment groups designed to
achieve a goal hba1c of either 6.0% (intensive group) or
7.0–7.9% (conventional group). after a mean of 3.5 years of
follow-up, there was a 22% increased risk of all-cause mortality
in the group randomized to intensive glycemic control that
resulted in the premature cessation of the intensive glycemic
control arm.[10] in addition, the accord trial contained two
embedded studies designed to evaluate the effect of intensive bp
control and combination treatment with a fibrate and hmg
coa-reductase inhibitor (statin), which also failed to improve
outcomes.[11,12]
publication of similar studies such as advance and
vadt examining intensive glycemic therapy that achieved
similar levels of glycemic control to that in the accord trial
have not shown harm but also did not reduce the occurrence of
either death or macrovascular complications.[13,14] in addition,
post-trial follow-up of the ukpds identified additional events
over time and found that there was a 15% risk reduction
for myocardial infarction and a 13% reduction in all-cause
mortality in the group treated with initial intensive glycemic
control.[15] while these studies have provided some reassurance
that intensive glycemic control is not harmful, the majority
have failed to show a significant impact on macrovascular
events, making it doubtful that hyperglycemia is the sole cause
of macrovascular diabetic complications.[16]

3. risk factors for cardiovascular disease
among patients with diabetes mellitus
patients with type ii diabetes frequently have additional
comorbidities and risk factors that are clearly associated with
the development of cardiovascular disease. the majority of the
comorbidities and risk factors associated with diabetes and
macrovascular complications are both modifiable and treatable. tobacco abuse, obesity, and reduced physical activity
have all been associated with both diabetes and the development of cardiovascular disease. for example, in the ukpds,
3055 patients with diabetes and no known coronary artery
disease were followed for the development of angina with ecg
changes, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death. in the
335 patients who had a cardiac event, risk factors such as increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels,
decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) levels,
increased systolic bp, and tobacco abuse were all positively
associated.[17]
the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and aggressive
atherosclerosis seen in patients with diabetes when compared
with the non-diabetic population has been hypothesized to be in
part due to differences in lipid profiles described as diabetic
dyslipidemia. while the pathogenesis of diabetic dyslipidemia is
not fully understood, it is clear that patients with diabetes have
increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, higher levels of smaller,
denser ldl-c particles, and lower hdl levels.[18] in patients
both at risk for and with coronary artery disease, the treatment
of hyperlipidemia has consistently been shown to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular events; however, even with treatment,
patients with diabetes have higher event rates when compared
with patients without diabetes.[19]
hypertension has long been associated with the development of both coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular
disease. the role of hypertension in the prevention of diabetic
complications has been studied in several trials. the ukpds
evaluated the relationship between diabetic complications and
systolic bp and found that for every 10 mmhg decrease in mean
systolic bp, the relative risk of death was reduced by 15% and
myocardial infarction by 11%. these effects persisted despite
the adjustment for other risk factors commonly associated with
macrovascular events such as glycemic control, hyperlipidemia,
tobacco abuse, age, and sex.[20] additional studies have also
shown that hypertension is the greatest risk factor for the development of cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes.[21] it is possible that the modification and treatment of
diabetic comorbidities will have a greater impact on improving
outcomes in patients with diabetes since there is a lack of sigª 2010 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

nificant and overwhelming evidence that glycemic control
prevents macrovascular complications (see section 2).[22]

4. therapies for the treatment of diabetes
there are multiple treatment options currently available for
patients with diabetes. dietary modifications and daily exercise
can provide adequate benefit in some patients with impaired
insulin sensitivity and diabetes; however, the majority of
patients with diabetes will require the initiation of hypoglycemic
therapies. oral hypoglycemic medications are commonly prescribed for patients with hba1c <9% or in whom diet/exercise
has not been sufficient. there are currently a variety of medications (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones [tzds],
exenatide, pramlinitide, and acarbose) approved for the treatment of hyperglycemia that all have differing mechanisms and
efficacy.[23] in addition, other hypoglycemic agents such as the
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitors (alogliptin and  xxxd2487xxx ) are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
the tzd class of medications are widely used in the treatment of diabetes and work through the binding and activation
of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars).
thus far, three ppars (ppar-b/d, ppar-g, and ppar-a,)
have been identified in humans, each of which has a unique
effect on lipid metabolism and glycemic control.[24] the tzds
currently approved for use in clinical practice (rosiglitazone
and pioglitazone) work predominantly through the activation
of ppar-g. while there are some class effects, each tzd has
differences in its effect on glycemic control and lipid profiles
that are likely explained by differences in the degree of ppar
agonism for each individual tzd.
rosiglitazone was the first currently available tzd approved
for use in clinical practice and is a strong ppar-g agonist.
(troglitazone was the first tzd approved for clinical use but it
was taken off the market in 2000 due to concerns regarding liver
failure.) during initial clinical trials, rosiglitazone was found to
be effective in reducing blood glucose levels with an average
decline in hba1c of 0.5–1.5% and fasting glucose levels of approximately 50 mg/dl.[25] in addition to the effects on blood
glucose levels, rosiglitazone was found to affect lipid levels with
an increase in both ldl-c and hdl-c levels. based on its effect
on the surrogate endpoint of blood glucose levels, rosiglitazone
was approved by the us fda for clinical use in 1999.[26]
the fda has also approved pioglitazone for use in clinical
practice. similar to rosiglitazone in its efficacy of blood glucose
control and reduction in hba1c, it has been suggested to have
slightly better effects on lipid parameters.[27] pioglitazone

increases ldl-c levels in a manner similar to rosiglitazone;
however, pioglitazone has been shown to significantly reduce
triglyceride levels and increase hdl-c levels such that there is
improvement in the hdl-c : ldl-c ratio.[27]
4.1 clinical studies of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (ppar)-g agonists

initial clinical studies of the ppar-g agonists were not
adequately powered to evaluate the effects on cardiovascular
clinical endpoints such as death, myocardial infarction, and
heart failure. based upon an apparent numeric excess of cardiac
complications in the smaller trials of rosiglitazone, nissen and
wolski[28] performed a meta-analysis of all publicly available
clinical studies of rosiglitazone and found a significant 43%
increased risk for myocardial infarction and a trend toward
an increase in death from cardiovascular causes. in addition,
both a meta-analysis and an observational study comparing
rosiglitazone with pioglitazone suggested that rosiglitazone
is associated with increased death, myocardial infarction, or
stroke, raising concern over its safety.[29,30] a subsequent
open-label, non-inferiority study did not show an increase in
cardiovascular mortality with rosiglitazone;[31] however, conclusions regarding the safety of rosiglitazone from this study
are limited by the low event rates that left it inadequately
powered. nevertheless, the trial was notable for a significant
increase in the rates of heart failure in patients treated with
rosiglitazone.
while data regarding the safety of rosiglitazone are contradictory and have been associated with controversy, studies of
pioglitazone have not identified similar concerns.[29,32] the effects of pioglitazone on cardiovascular outcomes were specifically addressed in the proactive study. in proactive,
patients with diabetes and hba1c >6.5% (regardless of whether
they were on hypoglycemic therapy) and evidence of extensive
macrovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery
at least 6 months before recruitment, or acute coronary syndrome at least 3 months before recruitment) were randomized
to pioglitazone versus placebo in addition to their existing
diabetic treatment regimen. the primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac and peripheral vascular events (all-cause
mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction/acute coronary
syndrome, stroke, endovascular or surgical intervention on the
coronary or leg arteries, or above the ankle amputation) that
was not reduced by pioglitazone. a prespecified secondary
endpoint of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke was significantly reduced by 16% in the
ª 2010 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

patients treated with pioglitazone. these data suggest pioglitazone may provide some level of secondary prevention among
patients with diabetes and macrovascular disease.
lincoff and colleagues[29] further evaluated the cardiovascular effects of pioglitazone with a meta-analysis of patient
level data collected from all manufacturer-sponsored clinical
trials of pioglitazone that were randomized, double-blinded,
and controlled with either placebo or an active comparator.
in the 19 trials identified (n = 16 390 patients), there was a
statistically significant 18% reduction in the risk of a composite
endpoint of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke among patients treated with pioglitazone. while this meta-analysis is limited in that 32% of the
entire population and 55% of the patient-years came from one
study, it provides further evidence that pioglitazone may be
effective in the prevention of vascular complications in patients
with diabetes.
4.2 dual ppar-a/g agonists

the reason for the apparent differences between cardiovascular outcomes with the tzd medications (see section 4.1)
has not been fully elucidated. it has been hypothesized that the
beneficial effects of pioglitazone on lipid profiles may play a
role, and it is known that agonists of ppar receptors modify
the transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid
metabolism. for this reason, efforts to improve the effects of
ppar receptor agonists on lipid parameters have focused on
increasing agonism toward the ppar-a receptor
the ppar-a receptor is the site of action for gemfibrozil,
 xxxd2096xxx , and some elements of omega-3  xxxd2154xxx .[33] in
clinical studies, ppar-a receptor agonists have been shown to
increase hdl levels, decrease triglyceride levels and  xxxd2154xxx ,
and shift ldl toward less atherogenic particles.[34] the positive
effects of fibrates (weak ppar-a receptor agonists) on both
hdl-c levels and cardiovascular endpoints have been shown
in clinical studies such as the helsinki heart study, va-hit,
and the field study (table ii).[35-37]
given the favorable effects of fibrates on both clinical and
lipid parameters and the hypoglycemic effects of ppar-g agonists (see section 4), a dual ppar-a/g agonist could be effective
in the treatment of patients with diabetes. termed the glitazars,
several dual ppar-a/g agonists have been developed, although
none have been approved for clinical use due to the results of
both preclinical animal studies and clinical studies.[25,38-40]
agents such as  xxxd3072xxx , mk-0767, and naveglitazar were
found to be associated with an increased incidence of
both bladder cancer and hyperplasia in rodent studies.[41] due

to these concerns, a phase iii study with  xxxd3072xxx  was
terminated early and further development was not pursued. in
addition, the development of tesaglitazar was discontinued
because of indications that it may cause renal dysfunction.[25]
muraglitazar is the glitazar with the most extensive data and
has been shown to be effective in reducing hba1c and triglyceride levels while increasing hdl-c levels.[42] after completion of phase iii studies, it was recommended for fda
approval. prior to official approval from the fda, a metaanalysis performed by nissen and coworkers[43] found that the
2374 patients treated with muraglitazar had an increased risk of
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke when compared with
patients who received either pioglitazone or placebo. after
publication of these data, the sponsor withdrew its application
from the fda and muraglitazar was never approved for clinical use. while the theoretical benefits of dual ppar agonism
are promising, development of agents has been limited due to
the adverse effect profile seen in prior studies.
4.2.1  xxxd106xxx 

a new dual ppar-a/g agonist,  xxxd106xxx , has recently been
developed by hoffmann-la roche. designed to be a balanced
agonist of both ppar-g and ppar-a, 13 clinical studies have
been completed thus far in over 600 patients evaluating the
clinical effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd106xxx . the
compound has been found to have peak onset in approximately
3 hours and a half-life between 5 and 16 hours.[44]
a phase ii dose-finding study on  xxxd106xxx  (synchrony)
was recently published.[38] this randomized, double-blind,
ª 2010 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients with type ii diabetes
who were either treatment-naı̈ve or had been previously treated
with no more than two antidiabetic agents. patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic bp >160 mmhg or diastolic bp
>100 mmhg), myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months,
congestive heart failure (new york heart association class iii
or iv), or therapy with fibrates within 1 month were excluded
from enrollment.
following a single-blind, 4- to 5-week placebo run-in period to
wash out any previous hypoglycemic or weight-lowering drugs,
332 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with one
of four  xxxd106xxx  doses (50 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg once
daily), placebo, or open-label pioglitazone. patients were followed
for 16 weeks with the primary endpoint being the efficacy of the
drug in reducing hba1c concentration over the study period.
changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose levels and lipid
profiles were prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints. given the
prior concerns regarding cardiac safety with the glitazars, an independent blinded clinical events committee adjudicated on, according to prospectively defined criteria, the incidence of safety
endpoints, including peripheral edema, death (cardiovascular vs
non-cardiovascular), heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and admission to hospital for unstable
angina. changes in bodyweight and renal function, as well as
markers of inflammation, were also measured.
after 16 weeks of therapy,  xxxd106xxx  when compared with
placebo was found to produce a significant, dose-dependent
reduction in hba1c of -0.85% (95% ci -0.50, -1.20; p < 0.0001)
and the concentration of fasting plasma glucose (-2.16

mmol/l, 95% ci -1.35 to -2.98; p < 0.0001). although the
study was not powered to assess the significance of differences
between  xxxd106xxx  and pioglitazone, the 150 mg dose of  xxxd106xxx  when compared with 45 mg of pioglitazone was associated with similar reductions in hba1c and fasting glucose
levels. perhaps more important than the hypoglycemic effects,
there were dose-dependent, statistically significant beneficial
effects on lipid parameters.  xxxd106xxx , compared with placebo, increased hdl-c levels in a dose-dependent manner by up
to 28% (figure 1) and reduced triglyceride levels by as much as
38% (figure 2).  xxxd106xxx  also significantly reduced ldl-c
levels, although by a lesser magnitude than the other lipid
fractions. the substantial favorable effects of  xxxd106xxx  on
hdl-c and triglyceride levels support the hypothesis that this
agent might reduce cardiovascular complications among diabetic patients.
all doses of  xxxd106xxx  were well tolerated throughout the
study. adverse event rates in the  xxxd106xxx  treatment groups
were similar to those of both the placebo and pioglitazone
groups. most adverse events were mild and considered unrelated to treatment; however, at all doses of  xxxd106xxx  there
were dose-dependent increases in both bodyweight and the
number of patients with edema, which were similar to those
with pioglitazone. prior studies of fibrates, tesaglitazar, and
phase i studies of  xxxd106xxx  have suggested that ppar-a
agonism may result in a decline in creatinine clearance. in
synchrony,  xxxd106xxx  reduced creatinine clearance by
between 4% and 14%. in patients treated with the 150 mg dose,
 xxxd106xxx  reduced creatinine clearance by 6% (table iii).
while these results are promising, caution is warranted in
overoptimistic interpretation of the data given that the small
sample size and short duration of this phase ii study prevent
definitive conclusions regarding both efficacy and long-term
safety of  xxxd106xxx . large-scale, ongoing phase iii studies will

provide both stronger evidence and further data on the effects
and safety of  xxxd106xxx .
based upon these data from the synchrony study, the
150 mg daily dose of  xxxd106xxx  was selected for the ongoing
phase iii trial because it was thought to offer the optimal
combination of glycemic control equal to that of pioglitazone,
adverse effects of magnitude equal to or less than with placebo
or pioglitazone, and favorable effects on lipid profiles that were
numerically greater than with pioglitazone. these findings from
synchrony suggest that  xxxd106xxx  may be an effective
agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia and the modification
of cardiac risk factors in diabetic patients, without the attendant
safety concerns observed with previously studied glitazars.
in light of previous studies that suggested pioglitazone may
reduce macrovascular complications,[32] the effect of  xxxd106xxx 
on lipid profiles observed in synchrony raise hope that an
agent with balanced ppar-a and -g agonism may favorably
influence cardiovascular endpoints while achieving glycemic
control. towards this end,  xxxd106xxx  is currently under evaluation in a large-scale phase iii randomized trial (alecardio)
to determine whether this agent can reduce cardiovascular
mortality and morbidity in patients with type ii diabetes and
a recent acute coronary syndrome event. a total of 6000 patients with type ii diabetes will be randomized within 2–6 weeks
of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (myocardial
infarction or unstable angina) to either 150 mg of aliglitazar or
placebo in addition to standard medical therapies for coronary
artery disease and diabetes. the trial is event-driven, and will
continue until there have been 950 adjudicated endpoints
and all patients have been treated for a sufficient duration
(minimum 2.5 years) to develop an adequate safety database.
the primary endpoint of the study is the time to first occurrence
of any component of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

5. conclusion
type ii diabetes is prevalent across the world and leads to
substantial disability and reduced life expectancy. while macrovascular complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction,
and peripheral vascular disease remain the most common
causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients, studies
evaluating the efficacy of intensive glycemic control have failed
to convincingly demonstrate a reduction in these macrovascular
events. given the lack of impact on cardiovascular endpoints
achieved through the reduction of hyperglycemia alone, increased attention has turned toward additional risk factors that
are common in patients with diabetes. hypoglycemic agents
with a positive impact on lipid parameters may be a promising
approach to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with
diabetes.  xxxd106xxx , a novel agonist of both ppar-g and
ppar-a, appears to be effective in the treatment of hyperglycemia while reducing triglyceride levels and increasing
hdl-c levels. a large-scale clinical trial of the effect of  xxxd106xxx  on cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and
stroke is currently ongoing. if successful, this investigation may
lead to approval of the first agent specifically targeted to reduce
the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.
