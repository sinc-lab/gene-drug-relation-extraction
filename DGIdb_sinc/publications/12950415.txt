review article: mechanisms of action of  xxxd2579xxx  in preventing colorectal carcinoma in inflammatory bowel disease.  a series of epidemiological, experimental and preliminary clinical trials strongly suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  or 5-aminosalicyclic acid ( xxxd2579xxx ) may have antineoplastic and potentially prophylactic chemopreventive properties. it is assumed that  xxxd2579xxx  may have similar genetic and molecular targets as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), which is further supported by its close similarity with aspirin, differing only in its structure by the presence of an amino group at position 5 of the benzene ring. the putative chemopreventive actions include the inhibition of inflammatory cascades and/or reactions involved in cell growth and proliferation, such as cyclo-oxygenase (cox-1 and cox-2), which regulate cell proliferation through the formation of prostaglandins; lipoxygenase; nuclear factor kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ), responsible for the subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory molecules; map kinases and bcl-2, as well as the activation of apoptotic processes, such as the stimulation of intestinal sphingomyelinase. the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor delta ( xxxg1806xxx ), which also regulates gene transcription, is thought to play a role in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory driven carcinogenesis. this may be another significant target. it is hypothesized that 5-asas may prevent the enhancing effect of prostaglandins on  xxxg1806xxx  binding to dna by its cox inhibitory properties, decreasing proliferation of colorectal mucosal cells in non-inflammatory bowel disease patients with sporadic polyps of the large bowel.
