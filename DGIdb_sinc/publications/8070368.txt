abstract
recent analyses of  xxxd2285xxx  (hfsh) using antipeptide antibodies. monoclonal antibodies. and chimeric constructions of hcg/hfsh
strbngly suggest that the &terminal region, including residues bl-100
of the hfsh b-subunit, is involved in subunit association as well as
hfsh heterodimer binding and/or activation of receptor. to test this
hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate five triple
alanine mutants of the c-terminal region of hfshp: qsl, h83,  xxxg85xxx ;
k86,  xxxd88xxx , s89; d90, s91, t92;  xxxd93xxx , t9.5, v96; and r97,  xxxg98xxx , l99. the
baculovirus-infected insect cell system was used for expression. high
five@cells were infected with virus harboring either ahfshp complementary dna (cdna) or wild-type hfsh@ (hfshp*) cdna and
coinfected with virus containing hfshol cdna. after infections, media
were assayed for fsh using a heterodimer-specific enzyme-linked
immunosorbent capture assay. all ahfshfl subunits formed heterodi-

mers with hfshp subunit and were secreted in the medium. these
results suggest, for all five mutants, that side chains of amino acids
substituted with alanine had no significant role in subunit association.
the fshs ahfsh and hfsh” were tested in a rra, using cell lines
that express the hfsh receptor, to determine if there were any changes
in binding activity. similarly, ahfsh and hfsh- were compared for
receptor activation by measuring the levels of progesterone production
in an in vitro fsh bioassay. ahfsh-(93-96) exhibited minimal binding
activity and no detectable steroidogenic activity. ahfsh-(97-99)
showed reduced binding affinity compared with that of hfsh”,
whereas the binding potency and bioactivity of the remaining ahfsh
were comparable to those of hfsh*. these data demonstrate that
within the hfsh&(81-99)
region,  xxxg815xxx -binding sites are contained within the sequence 93-99. (endocrinology 135: 1235-1240,

activate the inositol phosphate pathways (4, 5).
much progress has been made in elucidating the regions
of glycoprotein hormone subunits that interact with receptor
or its complementary subunit (6). studies employing chemical modifications and cross-linking of specific amino acid
residues (7, 8), highly specific antibodies (9, lo), synthetic
peptides (11, 12), immunological approaches (13, 14), and
site-directed mutagenesishave identified certain regions that
are important in determining the molecular structure and in
receptor binding and transduction of hormonal response(for
reviews, see refs. 6 and 15-17). early attempts to map the
surfacesof the glycoprotein hormones used the approach of
chemical modification, reviewed by ryan et al. (11). the
 xxxd2285xxx  (hfsh) p-subunit has been analyzed (18), and
its dna has been sequenced(19, 20). however, the tertiary
structure of hfsh/3 has not been resolved. the biological
activity of fsh depends on binding to its receptor, and this
requires interaction of specific sequencesof the hormone
subunits with the receptor as well as a specific interaction
between subunits. the role of specific amino acids within
each subunit in receptor binding and subunit associationis
not fully understood (21, 22).
it has been previously reported that the 81-100 c-terminal
region of hfsh/3 is involved in subunit associationas well as
receptor binding. antibodies that bind hfsh/3, but not heterodimeric hfsh, were mapped with hfsh/3 peptides to
determine the epitope. one monoclonal as well as one pol-

he glycoprotein hormones are a family of structurally related proteins including fsh, lh, tsh, and
cg. these hormones are synthesized and secreted by the
anterior pituitary gland, which is under hypothalamic and
gonadal control. the exception is cg, which is secreted by
placental cells in primates and equids. glycoprotein hormonesare heterodimeric, composedof noncovalently bound
ly-and p-subunits. the primary structure of the a-subunit of
the different glycoprotein hormones is identical within a
given species. however, between glycoprotein hormones,
the a-subunit has been shown to have different n-linked
oligosaccharide chains (l), which may result in conformational changes specific to each hormone. the hormonespecific p-subunits have different primary structures for each
glycoprotein hormone and are believed to confer specificity
of receptor binding to each hormone (2). however, there are
similaritiesbetween p-subunit sequencesfrom different hormones that may confer subunit association capability (3).
the glycoprotein hormones bind their receptors with similar
affinities, and all activate the  xxxg67xxx  signal transduction pathway. although less well defined, some appear to

yclonal anti-hfsh/3 antibody bound to synthetic peptide
hfsh-(81-100).
when this peptide was incubated with
hfshp and hfsha in  xxxg220xxx  recombination assay, it was
the most potent inhibitor of subunit recombination
(23).
these data suggested that amino acids within sequence
hfshp-(81-100)
participate in the subunit association of
hfsha and hfsh/3 to form heterodimeric fsh. synthetic
peptides of hfshp were tested as inhibitors of fsh binding
to receptor and for stimulation of estradiol biosynthesis (24).
peptides with the sequence 81-95 inhibited binding of fsh
to receptor and stimulated estradiol biosynthesis in sertoli
cells, suggesting that these sequences interacted with receptor
and could stimulate steroidogenesis (24).
to identify regions on the p-subunit responsible for receptor binding and specificity, campbell and co-workers
(25)
constructed hcg/i/hfshp chimeras in which cg/lh activity
could be switched to fsh activity. they noted that although
the chime& subunit, consisting of hcg/3 amino acid residues
1-93 and the hfsh/3 residues 94-l 14, associated with human
a-subunit, this heterodimer exhibited very little cg/lh
receptor binding, but bound efficiently to the  xxxg815xxx .
recently, morbeck et al. (26) tested a series of overlapping
peptides corresponding
to the entire sequences of the /3subunits of hlh and hcg to determine receptor-binding
sites. in both cg and lh, the sequence 81-95 of the /3subunit inhibits receptor binding (hcgp residues 81-95 correspond to hfsh@ residues 75-89). to clarify the contributions of specific amino acids in the hcgp-(93-100)
loop to
cg/ xxxg1325xxx  binding, puett and co-workers
replaced
single amino acid residues using site-directed mutagenesis
(27, 28). their results provided strong evidence that arg94,
arg95, ser96, thr9’, and asp99 contribute to cg/ xxxg1325xxx 
binding. these data provide experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis that amino acids within sequences
81-100 of hfsh@ are involved in receptor binding and
activation. in this communication we describe results obtained using site-directed mutagenesis to create triple mutations to alanine in the hfsh/3 sequence 81-99 (table 1). a
homologous system was used in which hfsh was tested for
receptor binding and activation using hfsh receptors.

for heterodimeric hfsh using hfsh/3- and hfsha-specific
antibodies, which bind heterodimeric hfsh (fig. 1). the
recombinant hfsh secretion levels in these seriesof experiments ranged from l-2 yg/ml.
in this capture elisa, the capture antibody mab
46.3h6.b7 was directed against hfsh@, and association of
hfshp with hfsha was detected using rabbit antipolyclonal

to assessthe ability of mutated subunits to associatewith
their wild-type complementary subunit (29).
the data in fig. 1 indicate that there was no significant

at present, the hfsh receptor-binding site(s)for the hfsh
receptor has not been conclusively identified. there is a
considerable amino acid homology among the p-subunits of
the glycoprotein hormones, and 12 cysteine residues that
form disulfide bonds are conserved in all p-subunits (2). this
homology and the fact that the common a-subunit associates
with all p-subunits indicates similarity in the folding patterns
of the p-subunits.
there is strong evidence that regions within the c-terminal
of the glycoprotein hormones are involved in receptor binding and activation. this may, however, involve different
binding determinants for each hormone. a putative determinant loop (35) within the c-terminal region of the glycoprotein hormone family has been examined for receptorbinding activity. for example, keutman et al. (10) demonstrated that synthetic peptides corresponding to hcg/3 and
hlh/i-(93-100) inhibit hcg binding to receptor. santa coloma and reichert (24) reported that hfsh&(bl-95) synthetic
peptide inhibited hfsh binding to the  xxxg815xxx  of calf
testicular membrane (although this requires an 0.8-mm peptide concentration). this sequence is analogous to hcgp
sequence93-100. however, studies by morris et al. (36) on
the htsh p-subunit demonstrated the analogous htsh/3
peptide is not active; instead, htsh&(lol-112) [corresponding to hfsh/i-(loo-llo)] inhibited the binding of bovine
tsh to receptor, whereas the htsh@-(86-93) peptide, spanning the loop 86-93, had minimal receptor binding inhibition. moreover, morbeck et al. (26) scanned the entire /3subunit of hlh and hcg; their results confirm the presence
of several binding regions in lh and cg p-subunit, of which
the sequence 81-95, not 93-100, appears to be the most
prominent [this corresponds to hfshp-(75-89)]. however, a
longer peptide spanning the sameregion, p-(81-105), was 5fold lessactive than p-(81-95). difficulties encountered when
using synthetic peptide could be due in part to steric differences between peptide and the entire protein. analyses by
campbell et al. (25) also suggestthat the hfshp c-terminal
region is involved in receptor binding and activation. these
investigators constructed a chimeric hcg@/hfshp subunit
consisting of residues hcg/3-(1-93) and hfsh/?-(94-114).
this chimera exhibited high binding affinity to the hfsh
receptor, suggesting that residues specific for receptor binding are contained in hfsh/3 sequences88-108. all of these
studies argue in favor of the hypothesis that residueswithin
the hfsh/3 c-terminal region are involved in receptor binding and bioactivity, and perhaps in subunit association, but
the exact residuesinvolved remain to be determined.
to precisely map the functional activity of the hfshp c-

hfshb c-terminal
terminal, we generated five triple alanine-scanning mutants
of hfshp-(81-99)
to investigate the involvement
of this
region of hfsh/3 in receptor binding and activation. to
preserve disulfide bridge formation, cysteines were not mutated. alanine mutation does not alter conformation or impose severe electrostatic or steric effects, and alanine is found
buried and exposed in proteins with equal frequency. thus,
the advantage of alanine mutagenesis is that the backbone
structure of the protein should be minimally altered (37-39).
in our present studies we tested the hypothesis that the
hfshp region 81-100 is involved in both subunit association
as well as receptor binding and activation. previously, vakharia et al. (23) demonstrated that the hfsh/3 synthetic
peptides corresponding to hfshp residues 81-111 greatly
inhibited association of (y- and p-subunits, suggesting that
this region contains residues involved in subunit association.
santa coloma et al. (40) found that synthetic peptides corresponding to hfsh&(ll-25),
-(41-55), -(51-65), and -(lol111) were able to bind to a-subunit. here we tested the triple
alanine-scanning mutants that span the hfshp-(81-99)
region, and all were capable of forming heterodimers with the
hfsh”’ a-subunit. this conclusion is based on an elisa
capture assay that was used to determine concentrations of
heterodimer per volume medium. within the limits of this
detection method, we found no noticeable difference in
heterodimer levels among the five ahfsh and hfsh”‘. we
conclude that none of the side chains of residues that were
changed to alanine is essential for subunit association. within
the 81-99 region, only four residues were not changed. these
were c82, c84, c87, and c94. it is conceivable that these
residues contribute to subunit association because of a motif
that is recognizable by the a-subunit. however, this could
be difficult to test because ruddon and co-workers (41) have
shown that the hcg/3 disulfide bond 93-100 is formed at
the same time that assembly with the a-subunit occurs [this
bond corresponds to hfshp-(87-94)].
it is a reasonable assumption that in this family of glycoprotein hormones, disulfide bonds are all being formed in a similar manner;
therefore, in hfsh the formation of the disulfide bond 8794 could be an important factor in heterodimer formation.
as only improperly folded subunit is not associated, small
effects may not be observed in viva. the association may
proceed much more efficiently in vim despite mutations that
would remove residuesthat play somerole in the association
process.subunit recombination in vitro is not a very efficient
procedure, yielding a 50-60% recombination.
in the current studies we examined short sequencesto
identify amino acids responsible for fsh binding and activation. these data demonstrate that hfsh@ residues  xxxd93xxx ,
t95, and v96 are involved in receptor binding. no progesterone was secreted by y-l cells treated with ahfsh-(9396) at a level lo-fold that of hfshw’, and ahfsh-(97-99)
showed reduced binding activity compared to hfshw’.however, it will be necessary to use a loo-fold molar excessof
ahfsh-(93-96) and ahfsh-(97-99) to confirm that there
heterodimers are involved in bioactivation. residues q81,
h83,  xxxg85xxx ; k86,  xxxd88xxx , s89; and d90, s91, t92 have no
functional significance, as these residuesare neither essential

for subunit association nor involved in receptor binding or
activation.
this work challenges the notion that the residuesforming
the so-called determinant loop of the glycoprotein hormones
define receptor binding (sequence87-94 in fsh). only one
residue within this loop,  xxxd93xxx , may be significant for fsh
binding. when comparing residues in the vicinity of the 12
cysteines, in all known mammalian glycoprotein hormone psubunits, the  xxxd233xxx  corresponding to position 99 in
hcgp and position 93 in hfsh is conserved (27). puett and
co-workers (42) prepared an inversion mutant in which arg94
and asp99 were switched to give hcg@asp94,arg99), this
mutant was capable of association with a-subunit, but the
resulting heterodimer had no bioactivity. theseinvestigators
(27) also made a single amino acid substitution, replacing
asp99with arg, and the resulting heterodimer was inactive.
they proposed that this negatively charged side-chain interacts with a positively charged group on the receptor.
in conclusion, mutational analyses of the hfshp c-terminal region 81-100 provides a functional map of residues
important for binding and activation of hfsh. to identify
which individual residuesare necessaryfor receptor binding,
we are preparing single mutants in this region. the current
work demonstrates that there is an hfsh receptor-binding
site at the c-terminal of the p-subunit, and that this site
flanks the c-terminal end of the determinant loop and involves amino acids within hfsh@-(93-99).
note

added

in proof

the crystal structure
of hcg has been reported
while this publication
was in press.‘,’ the homologous
loop of hcg/3 is surface accessible and
oriented into the solvent. the stretch of c-terminal
@ subunit including
the loop is wrapped
over the (y subunit
while remaining
covalently
bonded
to the p subunit
through
the disulfide
linkages
(9-90, 26-110)
(see footnote
1). there is a close association
between
the inner surface
of this part of the fl subunit and the 01 subunit including
a short area of
parallel @ sheet between
0 99-101 and o( 53-57 (see footnote
1). other
interactions
between
this stretch of fl subunit
and the (y subunit
were
noted (see footnotes
