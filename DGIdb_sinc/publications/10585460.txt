the liver cytosolic enzyme  xxxg131xxx  (fdh)1 converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10formyl-thf) to tetrahydrofolate (thf) in an nadp1-dependent dehydrogenase reaction or an nadp1-independent
hydrolase reaction (fig. 1) (1–3). 10-formyl-thf represents
one of the major forms of folate in the cell (4) and plays a
significant biological role, being involved in two reactions of the
de novo purine biosynthesis pathway (5). it is also involved in

protein biosynthesis in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria through formylation of the specialized methionyl-trna
that is necessary for initiation of translation (6). the dehydrogenase reaction performed by fdh is important for recycling
excess 10-formyl-thf that is not needed for purine biosynthesis and restoration of the thf pool (5). the reaction is probably
important also for metabolism of formate by clearing it as co2
and thus protecting the cell from formate intoxication (7). it is
not clear whether the hydrolase reaction has any physiological
significance and whether the reaction occurs in vivo. study of
the hydrolase reaction in vitro, however, is important as a
means of understanding the fdh mechanism. the enzyme has
a very complicated structure. it exists as a homotetramer of
902-residue subunits. the fdh monomer is composed of two
functional domains (amino- and carboxyl-terminal) connected
by an ;100-residue linker (8 –10). the carboxyl-terminal domain of fdh (residues 420 –902) has ;50% identity to class 1
and 2 aldehyde dehydrogenases (8, 9), suggesting that this part
of the fdh molecule is derived from an aldehyde dehydrogenase-related gene. earlier, we showed that the hydrolase catalytic center is located within a 310-residue amino-terminal
domain of the enzyme (10), whereas the dehydrogenase reaction requires the full-length enzyme (9, 10). we have also
shown that the 310-residue amino-terminal domain of fdh
(nt-fdh) can be expressed separately as a functional protein.
it bears the folate-binding site and carries out the 10-formylthf hydrolase reaction converting 10-formyl-thf to thf and
formate (10). thus, the enzyme is an interesting example of a
natural fusion of two unrelated proteins in which the aminoterminal domain bears the substrate-binding site while the
machinery of the aldehyde dehydrogenase homologous carboxyl-terminal domain is used as the catalytic center in the dehydrogenase reaction.
nt-fdh shares some sequence identity with other enzymes
that also use 10-formyl-thf as a substrate:  xxxd149xxx -ribonucleotide formyltransferase (gart) (11), l-methionyl-trna
formyltransferase (fmt) (6), and 10-formyl-thf hydrolase
(12). although the overall identity between proteins in this
group is low (16 –30%), there is a region of ;70 residues in the
middle of the peptide sequences where identity increases to
30 –50% (fig. 2). this region was predicted to be a folatebinding site (8). four out of the 14 conserved residues in this
region are glycines, and two are prolines, apparently reflecting
a similar overall fold of the region. resolved crystal structures
of two of the enzymes, gart (13, 14) and fmt (15), revealed
that despite relatively low overall sequence identity, this part
of the two protein molecules, which is adjacent to the bound
folate substrate, has a very similar structure (fig. 3) (13–15).
besides the glycine and proline residues, there is a strictly
conserved aspartate in this area that might be a candidate for
folate binding and/or catalysis. resolved crystal structures of
gart and fmt showed that this aspartate is adjacent to the

the enzyme  xxxg131xxx  (fdh) catalyzes conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate in either a dehydrogenase or
hydrolase reaction. the hydrolase reaction occurs in a
310-residue amino-terminal domain of fdh (nt-fdh),
whereas the dehydrogenase reaction requires the fulllength enzyme. nt-fdh shares some sequence identity
with several 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-utilizing enzymes. all these enzymes have a strictly conserved aspartate, which is asp142 in the case of nt-fdh. replacement of the aspartate with alanine, asparagine,
glutamate, or glutamine in nt-fdh resulted in complete
loss of hydrolase activity. all the mutants, however,
were able to bind folate, although with lower affinity
than wild-type nt-fdh. six other aspartate residues located near the conserved asp142 were substituted with
an alanine, and these substitutions did not result in any
significant changes in the hydrolase activity. the expressed d142a mutant of the full-length enzyme completely lost both hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities. this study shows that asp142 is an essential residue
in the enzyme mechanism for both the hydrolase and
dehydrogenase reactions of fdh, suggesting that either
the two catalytic centers of fdh are overlapped or the
dehydrogenase reaction occurs within the hydrolase
catalytic center.

substrate bound in the active center (13, 14) and imply that it
might function within the catalytic center. in the gart crystal
structure, the conserved aspartate is located within the flexible
loop, and it is likely that binding of the cofactor is required for
stabilization of this loop (16). however, the relative orientation
of this loop can vary considerably in all the different gart
structures (16). it is well known that protein flexibility is often
directly linked to protein function (16). earlier studies on
gart showed that mutation of the conserved aspartate to

asparagine results in non-active enzyme (11). later it was
concluded that the aspartate is not absolutely required for
catalysis, although its replacement results in an enzyme with
substantially reduced activity (17). from the crystal structure
of fmt, the conclusion has also been made that, similar to
gart, the conserved aspartate is located within the enzyme
active center and probably participates in the catalytic mechanism (15). in this work, we studied the role of the conserved
aspartate in fdh function.

involvement of asp142 in fdh enzyme mechanism
experimental procedures

purification steps contained 10 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm nan3.
the fdh mutant was purified from the cell-free culture medium by
affinity chromatography on a column of 5-formyltetrahydrofolatesepharose essentially as we earlier described (19). a column (1.5 3 10
cm) was packed with ;8.0 ml of settled gel and equilibrated with 10 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.4, containing 10 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm nan3
(buffer a). medium (200 ml) containing 2- xxxd26xxx  (10 mm) and
nan3 (1 mm) was applied to the affinity column. the column was then
washed with buffer a containing 1 m kcl (100 ml). the enzyme was
eluted from the column with buffer a containing 1 m kcl and 20 mm
 xxxd2146xxx . the eluate was passed through a column of bio-gel p6-dg
(bio-rad) equilibrated with buffer a and concentrated to ;5 ml using
an amicon filtration cell. additional purification was done on a mono q
column in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, with a linear kcl gradient (0 – 0.5 m
in buffer a) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (amersham pharmacia biotech).
analysis of the mutant proteins—sds-page was done according to
the method of laemmli (20) on an 8.0% gel. western immunoblot
analysis was performed as described by burnette (21) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against pure rat liver fdh and goat anti-rabbit igg
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (22). protein concentration was
determined using the bradford protein assay (23). amino-terminal sequence analysis of wild-type and mutant nt-fdh was carried out in the
vanderbilt medical center core facility using automated edman degradation with gas-phase analysis on an lf-3000 apparatus (beckman)
or on an applied biosystems model 470a protein sequencer
(perkin-elmer).
assay of enzyme activity—all assays were performed at 30 °c in a
perkin-elmer lambda 4b double-beam spectrophotometer. for measurement of hydrolase activity, the reaction mixture contained 0.05 m
tris-hcl, ph 7.8, 100 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , and 5 mm substrate
10-formyl-ddf. 10-formyl-ddf is an alternative, stable substrate for
the enzyme (24). the reaction was started by the addition of enzyme
(1–20 mg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml and read against a blank cuvette
containing all components except the enzyme. the appearance of the
product, 5,8-dideazafolate (ddf), was measured at 295 nm using a
molar extinction coefficient of 18.9 3 103 (25). the addition of nadp1
to the reaction mixture provided a measure of both dehydrogenase and
hydrolase activities, i.e. total activity of the enzyme. hydrolase activity
measured in the absence of nadp1 was subtracted from the total
activity to give the dehydrogenase activity. dehydrogenase activity was
also measured independently using the increase in absorbance at 340
nm due to production of nadph and a molar extinction coefficient of
6.2 3 103. aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using propanal as we earlier described (9). the reaction mixture contained 50 mm
caps, ph 9.4, 5 mm propanal, 1 mm nadp1, and enzyme in a total
volume of 1 ml. activity was estimated from the increase in absorbance
at 340 nm.
fluorescence studies—all fluorescence experiments were done on a
perkin-elmer model 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. emission
fluorescence spectra of wild-type and mutant nt-fdh were recorded by
scanning from 300 to 460 nm with fluorescence excitation at either 280
or 295 nm. protein samples (0.1 mg/ml) were in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5.
binding of 10-formyl-ddf and ddf to the nt-fdh mutants was detected by measuring the quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence.
protein samples (;10.0 nm) were in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.8. the
concentrations of ligands were varied from 2 to 2000 nm for 10-formylddf and from 50 nm to 40 mm for ddf. the experiments were done at
25 °c. fluorescence excitation was at 291 nm, and emission was monitored at 340 nm. the data were corrected for dilution effect, for 10formyl-ddf or ddf intrinsic fluorescence, and for absorptive screening
caused by ddf. intrinsic fluorescence of 10-formyl-ddf or ddf was
measured experimentally. in case of ddf, the observed fluorescence
signal was multiplied by the correction factor (c) to obtained the corrected data. the correction factor was calculated according to the equation c 5 10da/2, where da is the absorbance of ddf at the excitation
wavelength (26). kd values for the ligands were calculated from data on
fluorescence quenching in the presence of ligands that were plotted in a
linear form. the value (1 2 f/fo)21 was plotted against the inverse of
ligand concentration (27). this is a modified form of the classical sternvolmer plot that relates the decrease in fluorescence to the concentration of a collisional quencher (28). f is intrinsic fluorescence observed at
a quencher concentration; fo is fluorescence in the absence of quencher.
the slope of the line (least-squares fit) gave a kd. variation of the
measured values was ;5%.

materials—10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-formyl-ddf) was obtained from dr. john b. hynes (department of pharmaceutical chemistry, medical university of south carolina). all media were obtained
from difco or life technologies, inc. sds-page standards were purchased from amersham pharmacia biotech. other chemicals were obtained from sigma.
site-directed mutagenesis—we used the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene) to introduce point mutations into nt-fdh
cdna cloned to the prset vector (18) or into full-length fdh cdna
cloned to the pvl1393 vector (18). after introduction of the mutation,
the vector was transformed into escherichia coli xl-1 blue cells using
a standard protocol, and the cells were grown on lb/ampicillin plates to
allow mutant selection. plasmids were isolated by using the quantum
prep kit (bio-rad) and sequenced to identify clones carrying the mutation. the entire coding region of the clones carrying the introduced
mutations was sequenced to ensure the absence of random mutations.
sequencing was carried out in the vanderbilt medical center core
facility.
expression of nt-fdh mutants—expression of nt-fdh mutants was
done as we earlier described (18). the prset vector carrying the
mutation was transformed into e. coli bl21(de3) cells (novagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the cells were grown in 4 ml
of nzcym medium (life technologies, inc.) containing ampicillin (50
mg/ml) overnight at 37 °c with shaking. nzcym medium (100 ml)
containing ampicillin was inoculated with the overnight culture and
incubated at 37 °c with shaking until a600 5 0.6 (;6 h), followed by
induction with isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 3 g, 10 min), resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 2 mm edta, and 0.1% triton x-100), and incubated
for 30 min with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme at 37 °c. the suspension was
chilled on ice and sonicated (three times for 30 s). the cellular debris
was removed by centrifugation (13,000 3 g, 15 min, 5 °c), and the
supernatant was examined for the presence of nt-fdh by sds-page
followed by immunoblot analysis and for 10-formyl-ddf hydrolase
activity.
purification of nt-fdh mutants—the mutants were purified using a
procedure that we earlier developed for wild-type nt-fdh (18). all
buffers used in purification steps contained 1 mm nan3. the supernatant of the cell lysate (2 ml), obtained as described above, was dialyzed
overnight against 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, and was then passed
through a 0.2-mm filter (nalgene) to remove insoluble contaminants.
purification was done on a deae memsep 1000 hp ion-exchange
membrane chromatography cartridge (millipore corp.) with a linear
nacl gradient (0 – 0.4 m in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4) using a consep
lc100 chromatography system (millipore corp.). lysate samples of 1
ml each containing ;4 mg of total protein were used in the chromatography run. the chromatography was done at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min,
and fractions of 0.8 ml were collected. the fractions were analyzed for
the presence of nt-fdh by sds-page and immunoblot analysis. the
fractions containing nt-fdh were combined; dialyzed against 20 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.4; concentrated using a centricon 10 (amicon-millipore); and stored at 4 °c in the presence of 1 mm nan3 and 10 mm
2- xxxd26xxx .
expression of the d142a mutant of fdh—the expression of the
full-length fdh mutant was done in insect cells using a baculovirus
expression system as we previously described (19). the pvl1393 vector
carrying mutant fdh cdna and linearized acnpv viral dna were
cotransfected into sf9 cells using the baculogold transfection kit
(pharmingen, san diego, ca) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
recombinant viral stock was amplified in sf9 cells to produce high-titer
virus stock.  xxxd102xxx  cells were seeded as a monolayer in 25-cm2 flasks
(;2 3 106 cells/flask) and grown overnight. each flask was infected
with 0.1 ml of high-titer virus stock. culture medium and cells were
collected separately 2– 4 days post-infection, and the recombinant protein production was detected by sds-page (20) followed by western
immunoblot analysis (21) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised
against pure rat liver fdh and goat anti-rabbit igg conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase (bio-rad) (22). protein concentration was determined using the bradford protein assay (23). for large-scale recombinant protein production,  xxxd102xxx  cells were seeded in 225-cm2 flasks
(;20 3 106 cells/flask); and after growing overnight, each flask was
infected with 1.0 ml of high-titer virus stock. the culture medium at
96 h post-infection was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells,
and used to isolate recombinant protein.

results

site-directed mutagenesis of aspartate 142 in nt-fdh function—we mutated aspartate 142 to alanine and expressed the
mutants in e. coli. earlier, we had expressed nt-fdh in e. coli
(18) and showed that it is a functional protein identical to the
protein expressed in insect cells (10). the mutant was expressed as a soluble protein, and it showed a high level of
expression similar to that of wild-type nt-fdh (fig. 4a). analysis of 10-formyl-ddf hydrolase activity in the soluble fraction
of the cell lysate in which the mutant was the major protein
component did not reveal any activity. mutant nt-fdh was
purified (fig. 4b) from the cell lysate in one step by ion-exchange chromatography as we previously described (18). mutant and wild-type nt-fdh demonstrated identical chromatographic behavior when purified on an ion-exchange column
(data not shown). analysis of the purified mutant protein
showed that it did not produce detectable hydrolase activity.
based on the limit of the assay, we estimated that the mutant
had ,0.02% of the activity of wild-type nt-fdh. thus, we
assumed that the mutant was practically inactive.
we additionally expressed three nt-fdh mutants in which
aspartate 142 was changed to asparagine, glutamate, or glutamine. all of the expressed mutant proteins were soluble and
showed levels of expression similar to those of wild-type ntfdh and other mutants (fig. 4a). no 10-formyl-ddf hydrolase activity was detected in the soluble fraction of cell lysates
for all of the expressed mutants. the proteins were purified

(fig. 4b) using ion-exchange chromatography (18). all the mutants demonstrated identical chromatographic behavior during
the purification similar to that of the d142a mutant and wildtype nt-fdh (data not shown). assay of the hydrolase activities of the purified mutants showed that they all completely
lost activity. based on the detectable level of the activity, we
concluded that, similar to the results obtained with the d142a
mutant, the hydrolase activities of the mutants were ,0.02% of
that of the wild-type protein. to study whether recombinant
proteins were subjected to proteolytic degradation, we sequenced the first five residues from the amino-terminal end.
analysis of the amino-terminal sequences of wild-type nt-fdh
and the mutants showed that the sequences were identical and
corresponded to the original sequence of nt-fdh. we also
recorded emission spectra of protein fluorescence to learn
whether the mutations affected the protein tertiary structure.
the spectra were generated at an excitation wavelength of
either 280 or 295 nm. with excitation at 295 nm, the spectrum
reflects fluorescence of tryptophans, whereas at 280 nm excitation, there is significant contribution of tyrosine residues to
the fluorescence. nt-fdh has six tryptophan and five tyrosine
residues, with one of the tryptophans located just six residues
upstream of the mutated aspartate. we observed that emission
fluorescence spectra were identical for wild-type nt-fdh and
all asp142 mutants for each of the excitation wavelengths with
the maximum at 337 nm (data not shown).
site-directed mutagenesis of aspartates in the putative folate-binding region of nt-fdh—we also mutated to alanine all
other aspartate residues in the region between residues 106
and 158. in addition to d142a, the following mutants were
created and expressed in e. coli: d127a, d138a, d139a,
d145a, d157a, and d158a. all mutants were expressed as
soluble proteins, and they revealed high and similar levels of
expression. analysis of the 10-formyl-ddf hydrolase activity
in the soluble fraction of the cell revealed that all the mutants
possessed activity. we purified the mutants using ion-exchange
chromatography (18) (fig. 5) and measured their specific activity. all six mutants displayed activity similar to that of
wild-type nt-fdh (table i).
ligand binding study—we studied binding of 10-formylddf and ddf to the purified mutant proteins using titration
of tryptophan fluorescence (27, 28). we previously used this
approach to study binding of 10-formyl-ddf and ddf to fulllength fdh and nt-fdh (10). the fact that the hydrolase
reaction does not proceed in the absence of 2- xxxd26xxx 
allowed us to specifically measure binding of 10-formyl-ddf
since no reaction can take place (10, 24). to study binding
parameters under the same conditions, we also did not use

probably reflects changes in the affinity of folate binding due to
the mutation. nevertheless, the mutant still interacted with
the affinity column strongly enough to allow the use of this
procedure for purification. during ion-exchange chromatography on a mono q column, the mutant was eluted at ;0.3 m kcl,
similar to wild-type fdh. all three activities, i.e. hydrolase,
dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, inherent to wildtype fdh were assayed for the mutant. we observed that the
mutant protein displayed aldehyde dehydrogenase activity
similar to that of wild-type fdh (fig. 8). as expected, similar
to the nt-fdh mutants, the d142a fdh mutant completely
lost 10-formyl-ddf hydrolase activity (fig. 8). assay of 10formyl-ddf dehydrogenase activity revealed that, together
with the hydrolase activity, the fdh mutant also lost the
dehydrogenase activity (fig. 8). based on the detection limit of
the assay used, we estimated that the mutant has ,0.02% of
the hydrolase activity and ,0.01% of the dehydrogenase activity of wild-type nt-fdh. the difference in the figures is ex-

2- xxxd26xxx  in titrations with ddf. we observed significant and similar quenching of tryptophan fluorescence using
both 10-formyl-ddf (38% maximal quenching) and ddf (42%
maximal quenching). such a significant level of quenching
might be explained, in our opinion, by the fact that two out of
a total of six tryptophans of nt-fdh are located within the
conserved region, which was suggested to be a putative folatebinding site (8). two mutants, d142e and d142q, showed a
lower level of maximal quenching with 10-formyl-ddf (26%)
compared with the wild-type protein and d142n and d142a
mutants (36 –38%) (fig. 6a). we explain this phenomenon by
the fact that the longer side chain of glutamate or glutamine
apparently creates steric hindrance for the formyl group of the
substrate within the binding pocket, preventing it from assuming the correct orientation in which maximal quenching could
be achieved. limitation of the flexibility of the asp142-bearing
loop after introducing a residue with a longer side chain could
be the factor generating the steric hindrance. in contrast with
10-formyl-ddf, in the presence of ddf (which does not have a
formyl group), fluorescence was decreased in a similar manner
for all mutants as well as for wild-type nt-fdh, with maximal
quenching between 39 and 42% in each titration (fig. 6b). the
fluorescence experiments showed that mutation of the aspartate resulted in a significant decrease in apparent binding
affinity of nt-fdh for the substrate of the hydrolase reaction,
10-formyl-ddf, as well as for the product of the reaction, ddf
(table ii). the highest decrease was observed for the d142a
mutant, and the lowest changes were observed for the d142n
mutant. two other mutants, d142e and d142q, displayed
similar affinity, with apparent kd values intermediate between
those of the d142a and d142n mutants (table ii). all mutants
showed a proportional decrease in affinity for both 10-formylddf and ddf, with the difference in dg for binding of 10formyl-ddf and ddf within 2.0 –2.2 kcal/mol, similar to that
for the wild-type enzyme. this suggests that asp142 does not
contribute to the binding of the formyl group of the substrate.
site-directed mutagenesis of aspartate 142 in fdh—to
study the role of the conserved aspartate in fdh function, we
changed the residue in the full-length enzyme to alanine. the
fdh mutant was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as we previously described (9, 10). we
used this expression system instead of expression in e. coli
because earlier we showed (18) that, in contrast to nt-fdh, the
full-length enzyme is expressed in e. coli as an insoluble protein. the d142a mutant was expressed in insect cells in
amounts similar to those of wild-type fdh and was purified
(fig. 7) using affinity chromatography followed by chromatography on a mono q column. in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the mutant showed a slightly different elution pattern
from the affinity column, i.e. it started eluting at 1.0 m nacl,
whereas the wild-type enzyme was not eluted by 1.0 m nacl,
but required 20 mm folate to elute it (data not shown). this

plained by the fact that wild-type fdh has ;2-fold higher
dehydrogenase activity than hydrolase activity. thus, we concluded that the mutant was inactive with respect to both hydrolase and dehydrogenase reactions. to estimate conformational integrity of the mutant, we compared its emission
fluorescence spectra with the spectra of wild-type fdh at excitation wavelengths of 280 and 295 nm. at both excitation
wavelengths, the spectra of the wild-type enzyme and mutant
were similar, with an emission maximum at 335 nm (data not
shown).
discussion

there are several enzymes in the cell that use 10-formylthf as a substrate, either transferring the formyl group to
another compound or releasing it as formate. all these enzymes

have a strictly conserved aspartate that has been predicted to
be involved in substrate binding and/or catalysis of fdh (8).
studies on gart showed that this aspartate is an important
residue in the enzyme catalytic mechanism (11, 17). yet, the
simple extrapolation of the role of this residue in catalysis to
other enzymes is not valid. for example, another 10-formylthf-utilizing enzyme (aicar formyltransferase) that carries
out a reaction that is very similar to gart reaction has no
substantial identity to the other 10-formyl-thf-requiring enzymes. however, after introducing a number of gaps, the alignment of the conserved amino acid sequence of human gart
with the sequence of human aicar formyltransferase indicated that the sequence is at least partially conserved (30). as
a result of such an alignment, an aspartate residue in the
aicar formyltransferase sequence that corresponds to the
aspartate in the gart active site was identified. in contrast
with gart, site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed
that this residue is not involved in aicar formyltransferase
function (30). this led to the conclusion that this aspartate is
simply part of a common structural motif. the fact that 10formyl-thf synthetase/c1-synthase also reveals elements of
the conserved sequence (8) supports this conclusion. these
enzymes synthesize 10-formyl-thf from thf and formate in
an atp-dependent reaction (31), thus catalyzing a reaction
that is the reverse of the fdh hydrolase reaction. all c1synthetases also have a conserved aspartate corresponding to
the conserved aspartate of 10-formyl-thf-requiring enzymes
(8, 32). it has been shown, however, that, similar to aicar
formyltransferase, this aspartate is not a critical catalytic residue (32).
in the case of nt-fdh, the single amino acid substitution of
alanine for aspartate 142 resulted in complete loss of activity.
the common homologous region of 10-formyl-thf-requiring
enzymes is enriched with aspartate residues. in the case of
nt-fdh, seven out of 14 total protein aspartates are located in
this region within the sequence of 32 residues (fig. 2). besides
the strictly conserved aspartate, three out of the other six
aspartates in this region are common for three out of four
proteins. however, none of the residues except the conserved
one was crucial for hydrolase activity. to elucidate further the
role of asp142 in the function of the enzyme, we expressed
mutants in which the residue was changed to asparagine, glutamate, or glutamine, a common approach in the study of the
asp-asn-glu-gln quartet. in some cases, if aspartate is involved in catalysis, asparagine or glutamate is able to at least
partially compensate, and the proteins retain some enzyme
activity (33–39). in the case of nt-fdh, none of the mutants
revealed any hydrolase activity, suggesting that asp142 is an
essential and irreplaceable residue in the hydrolase catalytic
center of fdh. a similar result has been reported for gart;
the d144n gart mutant was essentially inactive (11). the
role of asp142 in fdh function is even more complex since the
residue is also critical for dehydrogenase catalysis. this suggests that the dehydrogenase mechanism is not independent
and is related to the hydrolase mechanism.
site-directed mutagenesis experiments often raise the question of whether the mutant retains the same folded conformation as the wild-type protein or whether the mutation creates
significant changes in protein conformation, in other words,
whether the lack of activity is a result of the loss of a catalytically important residue or whether it is just a result of incorrect folding due to changes in amino acid sequence. in most
cases, it is unlikely that a single amino acid substitution will
influence folding significantly (40, 41); and usually, the protein
compensates for changes by small adjustments in its structure
(42). in practice, there are simple signs, such as the level of

involvement of asp142 in fdh enzyme mechanism

expression and solubility of the recombinant protein, that indicate whether the protein is functional or whether there are
significant disturbances of its structure. in our experiments
asp142 mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type nt-fdh
except for lack of activity. they were expressed as soluble
proteins at the same level as wild-type nt-fdh, were eluted
from an ion-exchange column at the same concentration of salt,
and were recognized with specific antibodies raised against
fdh. comparison of emission fluorescence spectra of wild-type
and mutant nt-fdh indicated that the mutations did not alter
the environment of tryptophan or tyrosine residues, also sug-

gesting that protein conformation was not disturbed. all of the
above were also true for the d142a mutant of full-length fdh.
it is necessary to emphasize that mutation of three other aspartates (asp138, asp139, and asp145) located in close proximity
to the conserved one (just three and four residues upstream
and three residues downstream, respectively) did not change
the enzyme activity. this suggests that amino acid alterations
in this area do not noticeably affect protein conformation. this
probably is connected with the fact that the region presents a
flexible loop in protein structure. we make this assumption
based on the crystal structures of gart and fmt (see fig. 3).
all this together supports the conclusion about the direct involvement of asp142 in the hydrolase and dehydrogenase
reactions.
based on the calculated difference in dg for binding the
substrate and product of the reaction, we earlier suggested that
the formyl group of the substrate is hydrogen-bonded in the
protein-binding site (10). our present results suggest that the
conserved aspartate is not the residue involved in binding of
the substrate formyl group. this conclusion is based on the fact
that, compared with the wild-type protein, the mutants revealed a proportional decrease in affinity for both the substrate
(10-formyl-ddf) and the product (ddf) of the reaction. if
interaction occurs through the formyl group, the mutants
would display a decrease in affinity only for 10-formyl-ddf,
but not for ddf, which does not have the formyl group. binding
energy is often used as a characteristic of molecular recognition
in site-directed mutagenesis (43– 49). the difference between
dg for binding of 10-formyl-ddf and ddf was similar for the
wild-type enzyme and all mutants, suggesting no disruption of
bond(s) between the enzyme and the formyl group of the substrate. at the same time, replacement of asp142 resulted in a
significant decrease in affinity for folate, suggesting involvement of the residue in substrate binding. mutation of the
aspartate to alanine weakened the binding energy by ;1.7
kcal/mol, whereas the disruption of a hydrogen bond involving
a charged group generally weakens binding by 3.5– 4.5 kcal/mol
(50). if the aspartate is not involved in hydrogen bonding of
folate, the decrease in binding energy could probably reflect
weakening of electrostatic interactions or distortion of substrate due to slight conformational changes within the binding
pocket. however, the conformational alterations, if any, were
not significant since we did not detect any changes in tryptophan fluorescence of the mutants compared with wild-type
nt-fdh. in some cases, disruption of a hydrogen bond results
in lower changes in dg (51, 52). one possibility might be that
an oxygen of the carboxyl group of asp142 is hydrogen-bonded
to n-10 of folate through a molecule of water as was proposed
for gart (14). the oxygen of the carboxamide group of asparagine can probably significantly compensate for the oxygen of
the aspartate in the interaction with folate. asparagine, however, is not able at all to substitute for the aspartate in the
enzyme mechanism. summarizing, we would like to emphasize
that the binding experiments resulted in two conclusions: first,
that asp142 influences folate binding, and second, that it is not
involved in binding the formyl group of the substrate.
this study provides strong evidence that aspartate 142 contributes directly and profoundly to fdh catalysis and is an
essential residue for both hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities of fdh. this suggests that it is involved in both fdh
catalytic centers, leading to the conclusion that both centers
are overlapped. earlier, we showed that the dehydrogenase
reaction requires full-length fdh (9, 10). we also identified a
residue (cys707) located in the carboxyl-terminal domain of
fdh that is crucial for the dehydrogenase reaction, but that
does not participate in the hydrolase reaction of fdh (53).

fig. 9. model of the fdh hydrolase catalytic center. the loose
model suggests that hydrolase and dehydrogenase catalytic centers are
overlapped. flexibility of the loop where asp142 (shown as a closed
circle) is presumably located allows transfer of the substrate within the
binding pocket from the “hydrolase” site (a) to the “dehydrogenase” site
(b). the model with the tight substrate-binding pocket suggests that
there is no separate dehydrogenase catalytic center and that the dehydrogenase reaction occurs within the hydrolase catalytic center (c).

thus, transfer of the substrate within the superimposed catalytic center from the hydrolase to the dehydrogenase site
should allow its close contact with the cysteine in the carboxylterminal domain (fig. 9b). flexibility of the loop where the
aspartate is presumably located (see structures in fig. 3)
should allow such transfer switching between hydrolase (fig.
9a) and dehydrogenase (fig. 9b) reactions. this is the “loose”
model of the substrate-binding pocket. the switching from the
hydrolase reaction to the nadp1-dependent dehydrogenase
reaction in this model might be mediated, for example, by
binding of nadp1. the other possibility might be that the
substrate is not very flexible in the folate-binding site (fig. 9c).
this is the “tight” model of the substrate-binding pocket. in
this model, the dehydrogenase reaction occurs within the hydrolase catalytic center when cysteine 707 of the adjacent carboxyl-terminal domain is involved in the catalysis. both models
are consistent with existence of one folate-binding site/fdh
monomer (54). there is a principal difference between loose
and tight models of the catalytic center. the loose model suggests that either the hydrolase or the dehydrogenase reaction
can occur, and depending on the reaction, the formyl group is
removed from the substrate by two different mechanisms either as formate or as co2. the tight model suggests that the
dehydrogenase mechanism includes the hydrolase mechanism
as an essential part. we expect that further studies will allow
us to make more definite conclusions about the structure of the
hydrolase/dehydrogenase catalytic center and about the hydrolase/dehydrogenase catalytic mechanism.
