prefrontal cortical dopamine (da) regulates various executive cognitive functions, including attention and working memory. efforts to
enhance prefrontal-related cognition, which have focused on catecholaminergic stimulant drugs, have been unsatisfactory. recently, the
demonstration that a functional polymorphism in the catecholamine-o-methyltransferase (comt) gene impacts prefrontal cognition
raises the possibility of a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of prefrontal lobe executive dysfunction. to explore in a
proof of concept study the effects of  xxxd3395xxx , a cns penetrant specific comt inhibitor, we performed a randomized, double blind,
placebo controlled, and crossover design of this drug in normal subjects stratified by comt (val158met) genotype. comt enzyme
activity was determined in peripheral blood. forty-seven normal volunteers with no family history of psychiatric disorders underwent
neuropsychological testing and 34 of those subjects underwent physiological measurement of prefrontal information processing assessed
by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). we found significant drug effects on measures of
executive function and verbal episodic memory and a significant drug by genotype interaction on the latter, such that individuals with val/
val genotypes improved, whereas individuals with met/met genotypes worsened on  xxxd3395xxx . fmri revealed a significant tolcaponeinduced improvement in the efficiency of information processing in prefrontal cortex during a working memory test. this study
demonstrates enhancement of prefrontal cortical function in normal human subjects with a nonstimulant drug having comt inhibitory
activity. our results are consistent with data from animal studies and from computational models of the effects of selective enhancement
of da signaling in the prefrontal cortex.

introduction
recent studies have shown that a polymorphism in the
catecholamine-o-methyltransferase (comt) gene (val108/158
met) that encodes enzyme variants with different activity
can predict prefrontal cortical function presumably because
of varying the availability of synaptic dopamine (da). this
genetic effect has been demonstrated in humans for
performance on a variety of cognitive tests, such as working
memory and executive function (egan et al, 2001; ho et al,
2005) as well as prefrontal physiology as assessed by
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) (egan et al,

2001; mattay et al, 2003). there are also reports that
comt genotype affects function on declarative memory
tests referable to processing in temporal lobe structures
implicated in long-term memory (de frias et al, 2004)
converging evidence from electrophysiological studies in
experimental animals indicates that da focuses and
stabilizes prefrontal cortical networks by modulating
nmda, non-nmda, and gabaergic currents (seamans
and yang, 2004). consistent with this basic evidence,
neuroimaging studies with pharmacological manipulations
in normal humans using indirect agonists such as
amphetamine or with levodopa treatment in patients with
parkinson’s disease have demonstrated that increasing da
activity, to some extent, ‘focuses’ pfc activity during
executive cognition (ie it enhances prefrontal physiologic
‘efficiency’) (cools et al, 2002; mattay et al, 2000, 2002,
2003). in contrast to psychostimulant drugs (eg amphetamine, methylphenidate), which target all biogenic amines
throughout the brain, animal studies showed that comt
appears to specifically affect extracellular da levels,
primarily in cortical regions where da transporters are

1012

functionally inconsequential (gogos et al, 1998; mazei et al,
2002; moron et al, 2002; tunbridge et al, 2004).
a distinct but more specific pharmacological approach to
regulate cortical da signaling may be achieved by increasing extracellular da through inhibition of comt. in
humans, comt is found in high concentrations in the
cortex relative to subcortical regions such as the striatum
and amygdala (lloyd et al, 1975; matsumoto et al, 2003)
consistent with the absence of functional da transporters in
cortical areas such as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
(hall et al, 1999; mazei et al, 2002; pozzi et al, 1994; sesack
et al, 1998). thus, comt appears to represent the main
catabolic pathway by which da is removed from the cortical
synaptic cleft (karoum et al, 1994). even though the
knockout model presents a complex neurochemical neural
dynamics that goes beyond the mere synaptic neurotransmitter release or metabolism, studies of comt knock-out
mice and of comt inhibitors in rodents indicate that
comt has little impact on norepinephrine flux in
prefrontal cortex, perhaps because of the abundance of
functional norepinephrine transporters (gogos et al, 1998;
tunbridge et al, 2004). thus, relatively specific manipulation of prefrontal da through blockade of the activity of
comt may represent a novel approach to improve
cognitive function by increasing da-mediated prefrontal
signal-to-noise ratio, a measure of response strength
relative to background noise. moreover, because comt
does not appear to significantly impact extracellular da
levels in the rat striatum (gogos et al, 1998; li et al, 1998;
tunbridge et al, 2004) it might be expected that these effects
would occur without psychostimulant properties and abuse
potential.
in the last 30 years, a number of compounds with
inhibitory activity on comt were discovered (guldberg and
marsden, 1975). among them,  xxxd3395xxx  (zurcher et al,
1990a, b) proved to be the most potent in vitro. whereas
most of these comt inhibitors inhibit peripheral comt
with greater potency than the enzyme present in the central
nervous system,  xxxd3395xxx  does penetrate the blood–brain
barrier (ceravolo et al, 2002) and inhibits brain comt
activity in vivo with an inhibitory dose 50 (id50) value of
26–28 mg/kg in the rodent (da prada et al, 1991; zurcher
et al, 1991). in behavioral studies in rats, intraperitoneal
administration of  xxxd3395xxx  following pretraining facilitated
spatial working memory. similarly,  xxxd3395xxx  improved the
performance of senescent poor-performing rats in a spatial
memory task (liljequist et al, 1997). in patients with
parkinson’s disease,  xxxd3395xxx  was reported to improve
function in attentional tasks, auditory verbal short-term
memory, visuo-spatial recall, and constructional praxia,
changes that are not typically associated with levodopa
therapy alone (gasparini et al, 1997). taken together, these
data suggest that  xxxd3395xxx  may improve some aspects of
cognition. to our knowledge, this possibility has not been
tested in normal human subjects.
in this study, we have evaluated the effects of  xxxd3395xxx 
on measures of cognitive function and prefrontal cortical
information processing in normal subjects. specifically,
based on the prior evidence of the effects of genetic
variation in comt on cognition and prefrontal cortical
physiology, we predicted that comt inhibition in normal
volunteers would enhance prefrontally mediated cognitive
neuropsychopharmacology

function as measured on specific cognitive tests and the
efficiency of this processing assayed with fmri. we also
predicted that because comt val108/158met genotype
influences performance on cognitive tests of prefrontal
cortex function such as working memory and executive
function (egan et al, 2001; goldberg et al, 2003) as well as
prefrontal efficiency as assessed by fmri (egan et al, 2001;
mattay et al, 2002, 2003), that genotype would interact with
the effects of  xxxd3395xxx , such that individuals with val
alleles, because of their higher enzyme activity and
putatively lower da concentrations in the dlpc, would
show greater benefit.

methods
subjects and treatment
participants. normal volunteers were recruited from local
and national sources as volunteers for the ‘cbdb/nimh
sibling study’. briefly, all participants gave written informed consent to be part of an institutional review boardapproved protocol. all participants underwent a structured
clinical interview (scid-i) to rule out an active axis i
diagnosis and a questionnaire for evaluation of personality
disorder to rule out axis ii diagnosis. diagnosis was made
following dsm-iv criteria. the family history was obtained
by a trained research nurse using a sib study genogram
that gathers information up to third degree relatives and
beyond. the sample met the hardy–weinberg predictions
(hardy, 1908; weinberg, 1908). participants with a family
history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
schizophrenia spectrum disorder (schizotypal, paranoid,
schizoid personality, or delusional disorder) were excluded
from the study. participants were aged 18 to 55 years and
had an iq greater than 90. normal volunteers taking any
type of medication on a regular basis were excluded form
the study. to take part in the study, normal volunteers
needed to be off all medications for 6 weeks. individuals
with significant medical conditions that might affect the
central nervous or cardiovascular system, or liver function,
a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness for
longer than 5 min, or other drug or alcohol abuse within the
past 3 months were excluded. because of the potential toxic
effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on liver function, subjects with a history
of alcohol dependence were excluded. demographics of the
sample are listed in table 1. forty-seven individuals
participated in the study. seventy-eight percent of the
participants were caucasians of european ancestry, 11%
were african american, 7% were asians, 2% were
hispanics, and 2% mixed race. demographic breakdown
across the three genotypes groups did not differ (table 1).

treatment. subjects were enrolled as outpatients for a
double-blind, placebo controlled, and crossover study
lasting 3 weeks. a table of random numbers was used to
prepare the randomization. both  xxxd3395xxx  and placebo
were coded. coded  xxxd3395xxx  was administered for 7 days at
a dose of 100 mg three times a day on the first day and then
at a dose of 200 mg three times a day for the next 6 days.
neuropsychological testing and fmri were performed on
the seventh day. after a one-week wash-out period
following the first arm, the subjects who received coded
 xxxd3395xxx  received coded placebo three times a day and
those who started on the coded placebo received coded
 xxxd3395xxx  three times a day, in both cases for 7 days. at the
end of both arms, coded compounds were discontinued
over a 3-day period to avoid potential withdrawal reactions.
to mask the urine discoloration produced by  xxxd3395xxx ,
participants took also a coded capsule containing 100 mg
of riboflavin twice daily during both arms of the
protocol.
test schedule. prior studies have shown that plasma levels
peak about 1.5–2.0 h after administration of  xxxd3395xxx  and
maximum inhibition of comt activity in red blood cells is
achieved between 1 and 4 h following administration of the
drug (jorga et al, 1999; jorga, 1998; mannisto and kaakkola,
1999). therefore, neuropsychological testing (npt) and
fmri were performed 2 h after the dose of  xxxd3395xxx  on day
7 and the neuropsychological battery was completed in 75–
80 min for the npt and 60–75 min for the fmri. functional
mri was started at 2 h after the morning dose and npt was
started at 2 h after the afternoon dose.

neuropsychological testing
the following tests were administered to all subjects: (1) n
back test of working memory and updating. we used a
block design in which subjects perform first a block of 1
backs, then a block of 3 backs, a block of 0 backs, and finally
a block of 2 backs. the dependent measure included
accuracy and reaction time (rt) for the 0 back, 1 back, 2
back and 3 back conditions (this task was administered to
42 subjects); (2) verbal fluency (for categories), in which
subjects are asked to generate as many words as they can
in 1 min that fit within an exemplar category (eg animals,
groceries); (3) verbal episodic memory (a list of 15
semantically unrelated words was presented orally by the
examiner, followed by immediate free recall; the list was
repeated three times); (4) continuous performance test of
target detection and attention; (5) cantab intradimensional/extradimensional (id/ed) componential test of set
shifting; (6) letter number span; (7) trail making b test of
attention, visual scanning, and rapid set switching; and (8)
wisconsin card sorting test of executive function.
these specific tests were selected because they have
demonstrated sensitivity to comt genotype (notably, n
back, cpt, verbal memory, id/ed), engage prefrontal
cortical processes, and/or demonstrate a response to
psychostimulant medication (notably verbal fluency, trail
making and letter number span) (d’esposito et al, 2000;
gold et al, 1997; gourovitch et al, 2000).

profile of mood states. the poms (mcnair and lorr, 1981),
a self-rated questionnaire consisting of 65 items, was
administered in order to assess whether  xxxd3395xxx  induced
changes in mood or activation.
data analysis. all cognitive variables were analyzed by
repeated measure anova in which drug status (on
 xxxd3395xxx , off  xxxd3395xxx ) served as the within-subject
variable, and order (drug then placebo or placebo then
drug) and comt genotype (val homozygote, met homozygote, val/met heterozygote) served as between-subject
class variables. based on the earlier studies cited above, we
were particularly interested in the main effects of drug and
drug  genotype interactions, suggesting genotypic modulation of drug responses.
fmri data acquisition
each subject was scanned using a ge sigma 3t scanner with
a real-time functional imaging upgrade (milwaukee, wi).
bold fmri (gradient echo epi sequence, 24 axial 6 mm
thick interleaved slices, tr/te ¼ 2000/30 ms, flip angle ¼ 901,
fov ¼ 24 cm, and matrix ¼ 64  64) was conducted while
subjects performed three levels of the wm task. stimuli were
presented via a fiber-optic goggle system and the responses
were recorded via a fiber-optic response box. during each
treatment condition, four cycles of the wm task (1-back, 2back, or 3-back) alternating with the 0-back (sensorimotor
task) were administered. each task combination was
obtained in 4 min and 8 s, 124 whole-brain images with four
cycles of 30 images each (15 during working memory
(1-back, 2-back, or 3-back) and 15 during the 0-back task.
the first four scans at the beginning of each time series were
acquired to allow the signal to reach a steadystate and were
not included in the final analysis. the order of the task
combinations was counterbalanced across subjects but
maintained within subjects across drug conditions. we used
a block design for the fmri task in which 1-, 2-, or 3-back
alternate with the 0-back and were administered as separate
runs. the procedure is precisely as described in a study of the
effects of amphetamine on this task in normal subjects
(mattay et al, 2003). to preclude the effects of learning on
brain activation patterns, all subjects were trained on the nback task until they reached a ceiling in their performance.
the training was ‘subject specific’. this was performed
during a separate session before the fmri sessions. with
such a design, although it is unlikely for individuals to
improve on their n-back performance scores during the
fmri procedure, there could be an improvement in cortical
efficiency (ie a decrease in bold activity for the same level of
performance).

image processing
in three subjects, imaging data could not be acquired at all
three levels of the n-back working memory task owing to
time constraints, and in another three subjects, imaging
data from one of the two sessions were lost owing to a
computer malfunction. image analysis, therefore, was
limited to data from the 41 subjects with complete data
sets. whole-brain analysis was completed using spm99
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), again as described
neuropsychopharmacology

 xxxd3395xxx  and cognition and cortical information processing

elsewhere (mattay et al, 2003). briefly, images for each
subject were realigned to the first volume in the time series
to correct for head motion, spatially normalized into a
standard stereotactic space (montreal neurological institute
template) using a 12-parameter affine model and smoothed
to minimize noise and residual differences in gyral anatomy
with a gaussian filter, set  xxxd1891xxx  mm full-width at halfmaximum. voxel-wise signal intensities were ratio normalized to the whole-brain global mean. data sets were also
screened for high quality (scan stability) as demonstrated
by small motion correction (o5 mm translation and 31
rotation) and matched voxel variance across the drug and
placebo sessions. data from 34 subjects (8 met/met, 16 val/
met, 10 val/val) met these stringent criteria and final image
analysis was limited to the data from these subjects.
predetermined condition effects at each voxel were
calculated using a t-statistic, producing a statistical image
for the contrast of the working memory task (1-back,
2-back, or 3-back) vs the sensorimotor control (0-back) for
each subject for each drug condition. these individual
contrast images were then used in a conservative secondlevel random effects model that account for both scan-toscan and subject-to-subject variability.
because of our strong a priori hypothesis as noted above,
and our use of a rigorous random effects statistical model, a
statistical threshold of po0.05, with a small volume
correction (svcfusing 30 mm diameter spheres over the
activation peaks in the right and left dlpfc) for multiple
comparisons, was used to identify significant responses for
all comparisons.
for the analysis, a series of one-tailed t-tests were
performed to evaluate the main effects of the working
memory task at each level of task difficulty during each
drug condition. analysis of variance (anova) was then
performed to explore drug, genotype, and working memory
load effects. the latter analysis was constrained by using a
mask obtained by combining the one-tailed t-test activation
maps for each working memory task level during both
placebo and  xxxd3395xxx  conditions. post hoc analysis was
performed using a region of interest approach. volumes of
interest (voi) were defined in the right and left dlpfc (ba
9/46) encompassing voxels that showed a significant main
effect of drug (po0.02, in right dlpfc and po0.03, svc
in left dlpfc). using marsbar (http://www.marsbar.
sourceforge.net), mean percentage change in bold signal
was extracted from these voi for each wm task state and
each drug condition in every subject.

comt genotyping
blood samples were collected from all participants, and
dna was extracted using standard methods. comt
val158met (rs4680 g to a) genotyping was determined
using taqman 50 -exonuclease allelic discrimination assay
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) as described elsewhere (chen et al, 2004).

comt enzyme assay
comt enzyme activity was determined in whole peripheral
blood collected after 7 days of treatment with either placebo
or  xxxd3395xxx . blood was obtained before and 4 h after
neuropsychopharmacology

the morning administration of placebo or  xxxd3395xxx . the
comt enzyme activity assay is based on the organic solvent
extraction method that separates the radioactive product,
the methylated catechol, and the free radioactive coenzyme, 3h- xxxd3156xxx  (sam). one hundred
microgram of supernatant at a concentration of 5 mg
protein/ml was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube
from each sample and equilibrated to temperature shortly
before the enzyme assay. five hundred microgram of the
substrate mixture containing 10 mm tris, ph 7.4, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1.5 mci of 3sam, 10 mm of catechol, and 1 mm of dtt
was added to each tube. the tubes were then incubated at
371c for 20 min. the reactions were immediately terminated
by placing the tubes on ice and adding 500 ml of 1 m hcl.
the radioisotope-labeled catechol products from the reactions were extracted and determined by mixing the reaction
mixture with 10 ml scintillation fluid (flow i, molecular
diagnosis) and measuring the radioactivity of the mixture
in a scintillation counter. the relative comt enzyme
activity is presented as dpm per mg total protein. to
establish a baseline control for nonspecific reactions that do
not depend on comt, 5 ml of the specific comt inhibitor,
 xxxd3395xxx  (10 mg/ml), was added to a tube containing
100 mg of the sample. the high concentration of potent
inhibitor will block the specific reaction catalyzed by
comt, and the radioactivity from this reaction served as
a baseline. each sample was assayed three times and the
mean taken as the measure of comt activity. comt
activity during the two placebo time points was highly
correlated (r ¼ 0.90, po0.0001, spearman rank order
correlation).

results
demographic information
of the 51 volunteers who qualified for the study, four
subjects dropped out from the study, thus 47 subjects were
available for the final analysis. one male dropped out owing
to gastrointestinal difficulties thought unrelated to  xxxd3395xxx , and one female and one male dropped out before
starting the compound for undisclosed reasons. a second
female tested weakly positive for pregnancy at the end of
her first arm (placebo) and her trial was discontinued. all
47 subjects were included in the neuropsychological testing
analysis. however, only 34 were included for fmri analysis
and 39 for comt enzyme assays. subjects were excluded
because they did not complete the entire fmri study, or
because of unavailability of the mri scanner or their blood.
all subjects confirmed urine discoloration throughout the
trial. the most common side effects reported with  xxxd3395xxx 
were dizziness (10%), nausea (10%), diarrhea (10%), loss of
appetite (5%), stiffness (5%), sleep difficulties (5%), muscle
spasms (2%), and irritability (2%). similar reports occurred
with placebo: that is nausea (10%), sleep difficulties (7%),
loss of appetite (7%), diarrhea (7%), dizziness (7%),
vomiting (2%), and stiffness (2%). in all cases, symptoms
were mild and short lived with the exception of one subject
in whom gi symptoms were moderate. in two subjects, liver
enzyme levels doubled during the active phase of the
protocol. lfts rapidly normalized after discontinuing the
compound.

the demographic characteristics of the 47 individuals
who completed the study are presented in table 1. fifteen
subjects had val/val genotypes, 21 were val/met, and 11 were
met/met. nonparametric analysis for gender revealed
nonsignificant differences between genotypes (w2 ¼ 2.52,
p ¼ 0.11, val/val vs val/met; w2 ¼ 2.69, p ¼ 0.10 val/met vs
met/met; w2 ¼ 0.04, p ¼ 0.85 met/met vs val/val). anova
comparisons for age, education, or iq revealed no
significant differences between genotypes groups (table 1).

comt enzyme assay in blood
determination of whole-blood comt activity on placebo
(‘baseline’) showed that val/val individuals had higher
enzyme activity when compared to val/met and met/met
individuals (56 656710 292 cpm/mg protein, val/val; 46 0397
9078 cpm/mg protein, val/met; 39 41375126 cpm mg protein, met/met) (see figure 1). these data are consistent with
earlier reports of the effect of comt genotype on red blood
cell comt activity (syvanen et al, 1997). no gender
differences in comt activity were observed in the whole
cohort or in the cohort stratified by genotype during the
placebo phase. analysis of variance of these data showed a
highly significant effect of genotype on comt activity
(f(36) ¼ 9.29; p ¼ 0.0005). post hoc analysis indicated that
val/val individuals have greater activity than val/met
subjects (po0.001) and met/met individuals (p ¼ 0.001).
likely due to small sample size, there were no significant
differences between the val/met and the met/met groups.
repeated measures anova of comt activity determined
4 h after treatment (placebo vs  xxxd3395xxx ) revealed a
highly significant drug effect (f(36) ¼ 84.9; po0.0001) and
a significant genotype  drug interaction (f(36) ¼ 11.80;
p ¼ 0.0001) (figure 1). repeated measure anova of comt
activity before the morning dose of medication revealed a
main effect of genotype (p(36) ¼ 6.42, p ¼ 0.004) and of
drug (f(36) ¼ 34.45, p ¼ 0.0001), but no drug  genotype
interaction (f(36) ¼ 2.25, p ¼ 0.12). on average, however,  xxxd3395xxx  administration at this dose led to only

neuropsychological testing
three of the tests of executive cognition showed positive
effects of  xxxd3395xxx . on the trail making test, a significant
effect of  xxxd3395xxx  (f ¼ 4.64, df ¼ 1, po0.05) was observed,
ie individuals while on  xxxd3395xxx  performed the trail
making test more rapidly than while on placebo
(figure 2a). no order (f ¼ 0.03, df ¼ 1, p40.05) nor
genotype (f ¼ 0.10, df ¼ 2, p40.05) effects were present,
nor was a genotype  drug interaction (f ¼ 0.18, df ¼ 2,
p40.05) found for this test. for the n-back test, a
drug  test interaction (f ¼ 2.8, df ¼ 3.30, po0.05) was
present on the rt measure, such that rt for 2- and 3back conditions improved with  xxxd3395xxx , whereas rt for
the less demanding 0- and 1-back conditions showed little
change. no genotype (f ¼ 0.24, df ¼ 2,10, p40.05) or order
(f ¼ 0.53, df ¼ 1.10, p40.05) effects were present, nor was a
genotype  drug interaction (f ¼ 0.02, df ¼ 2.10, p40.05)
found (figure 2b). for intradimensional set shifting, a
significant drug  genotype interaction (f ¼ 4.9, df ¼ 2,
po0.05) was present, such that individuals with val/val
genotypes markedly improved while receiving  xxxd3395xxx ,
whereas individuals with met/met genotypes worsened
(figure 2d).  xxxd3395xxx  also showed a trend for the
predicted effect on verbal episodic memory in the form of
a drug  genotype interaction (f ¼ 2.34, df ¼ 2, p ¼ 0.1),
such that individuals with val/val genotypes markedly
improved while receiving  xxxd3395xxx , whereas individuals
with met/met genotypes worsened. neither order effects
were present (f ¼ 1.6, df ¼ 1, p40.05) (figure 2c). for none
of these three tasks was either a main effect of drug status
(f ¼ 1.45, df ¼ 1, p40.05) or a main effect of genotype
(f ¼ 2.08, df ¼ 2, p40.05) found, likely because of these
interaction effects. no order effects or other interactions
were found.
as a further exploration of the specificity of these findings
to  xxxd3395xxx  treatment per se, we also constructed a series of
multiple regressions in order to assess whether variance in
 xxxd3395xxx -induced comt inhibition independently contributed to variance in cognition effects. on–off difference
scores for each cognitive measure served as the dependent
variables. genotype, percent comt inhibition (derived
from active drug vs placebo activity measures), and
genotype  percent comt inhibition served as the independent variables in each regression. percent inhibition did
not enter significantly (ie po0.15) in any of the regressions.
thus, individual variations in comt inhibition in peripheral blood were not a significant predictor of cognitive
response to  xxxd3395xxx , independent of the fact of drug
administration. however, consistent with drug status 
genotype interactions in the anova analyses (see above),
comt genotype entered significantly as a predictor of
verbal memory recall and id shifting.
there were no changes in any of the poms scales
associated with  xxxd3395xxx  treatment. specifically, scales for
tension, vigor, anger, and fatigue did not differ significantly
between the arms of the study (by matched pair t-test, all
p40.10).

imaging results
the spatial distribution of the n-back-related activation
responses analyzed as a main effect of task included pfc
(ba 9-10/44-46), pericingulate cortex, anterior cingulate
(ba 24, 32), and parietal cortex (ba 7, 39-40) bilaterally at
all levels of task difficulty on both drug conditions. analysis
of variance revealed a significant main effect of drug on the
efficiency of information processing during the task, with
greater activation in brain regions subserving wm,
particularly in the dlpfc (ba 9/46) bilaterally on placebo
compared with  xxxd3395xxx  (po0.02, svc in right dlpfc;
po0.03, svc in left dlpfc) (figure 3a and b). this was
observed in the absence of a significant difference in
accuracy or rt across the two drug conditions (data not
shown). analysis in the reverse direction did not reveal
hyperactivation in the pfc on  xxxd3395xxx  relative to the
placebo condition. these data are consistent with prior
results based on comt genotype in normal subjects and
with our hypotheses based on these prior probabilities.

comment
we have found that  xxxd3395xxx , a cns penetrant comt
inhibitor (ceravolo et al, 2002), enhances memory and
executive cognition and the physiologic efficiency of
neuropsychopharmacology

prefrontal cortical information processing in normal human
subjects. to our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a
pharmacological enhancement of these functions in normal
subjects without psychostimulant properties. our data are
consistent with the effects of a functional polymorphism in
the comt gene on similar cognitive and physiologic
measures in normal subjects, and with some of the effects
of amphetamine, an indirect monaminergic agonist with
psychostimulant effects. whereas biogenic aminergic
stimulants tend to enhance da, norepinephrine, and
serotonin in widespread regions of brain,  xxxd3395xxx 
relatively selectively enhances cortical extracellular da
levels (tunbridge et al, 2004). these regionally restricted
effects of comt inhibition, which are consistent with the
apparent lack of psychostimulant properties of  xxxd3395xxx ,
suggest low potential for abuse and tolerance.
our cognitive effects are also in line with previous clinical
data on elderly patients with parkinson’s disease in which
 xxxd3395xxx  administered over a 6-month period in combination with l-dopa was effective in improving working
memory and attentional impairments, and these effects
persisted even after tapering the dose of l-dopa (gasparini
et al, 1997). the maximum clinical effect of  xxxd3395xxx  in
patients with parkinson’s disease was reported to occur
during the first day of treatment and continued unchanged
during the first week of treatment. experimental studies in

animals showed that  xxxd3395xxx  has a 60% brain bioavailability reaching a brain concentration to 1% of plasma
concentrations (forsberg et al, 2003).  xxxd3395xxx  inhibits
brain comt with an id50 of about 27 mg/kg reaching a 70%
comt activity inhibition within 30 min (da prada et al,
1991; zurcher et al, 1991). in human volunteers, a 70%
maximum inhibition of red blood cells comt activity is
observed at 2 h with a 60% inhibition at 4 h after an acute
dose of 200 mg of  xxxd3395xxx  (jorga, 1998). previous studies
of comt activity in human red blood cells (syvanen et al,
1997) and in human brain (chen et al, 2004) have also
indicated that comt val/met genotype affects comt
activity, but the difference between homozygote genotypes
is less than that associated with higher doses of  xxxd3395xxx 
administration. our data in peripheral blood on and off
 xxxd3395xxx  are consistent with these various earlier reports.
interestingly, we found evidence that comt genotype
interacts with  xxxd3395xxx -induced inhibition, such that val/
val individuals may be more drug sensitive. this may reflect
the greater capacity of the val allele to bind ligand because
of its greater stability (chen et al, 2004). however, these
results involve small samples of met/met individuals and
need further investigation.
a previous fmri study showed that prefrontal da
receptor activation with amphetamine results in an
improvement in the efficiency of pfc information proces-

sing during the same n back test in normal volunteers
(mattay et al, 2003). a similar effect of l-dopa therapy was
found in patients with parkinson’s disease undergoing fmri
during the same task (mattay et al, 2002). efficiency is an
operational measure of information processing based on the
fmri response during working memory challenge. in
principle, the same behavioral output in the context of less
cortical activation would imply more efficient processing of
the information. in our study,  xxxd3395xxx  also improved
dlpfc functional efficiency in normal volunteers. we did
not, however, observe overall significant genotype by
 xxxd3395xxx  effects on fmri-based efficiency measures, likely
because of the limited power of the small sample. similarly,
 xxxd3395xxx  improved frontal lobe function as revealed by
several significant effects on tests of executive function,
psychomotor speed and speed of processing, verbal
memory, and measurements of intradimensional shifting.
in these latter two tests, drug  genotype effects were
observed, because of a particularly positive effect in val/
val individuals. this drug by genotype effect is consistent
with relatively lower prefrontal cortical da signaling in
these subjects and presumed benefit of enhanced prefrontal
da in this context (mattay et al, 2003; weinberger et al,
2001).
we observed main effects of  xxxd3395xxx  in tests that
demand speed of response in the context of working
neuropsychopharmacology

memory, namely trail making (in which the sequencing of
letters and numbers proceeds in an alternating fashion) and
n back at high loads in which updating of the working
memory buffer is near continuous. for two other tasks, the
response to  xxxd3395xxx  was modulated by comt genotype.
intradimensional shifting requires rule generalization in the
face of a salient distractor; we have found an effect of comt
genotype in a large sample of schizophrenic probands that
are consistent with these results (diaz-asper et al, 2005).
the comt effect on episodic memory may reflect its effect
on prefrontal cortical function, a region engaged during
encoding of verbal information and/or engagement of the
medial-temporal lobe thought to be involved in the
consolidation of the memoranda. regarding the latter
possibility, in humans comt is known to be abundantly
expressed in medial temporal lobe regions, especially the
hippocampus (matsumoto et al, 2003). furthermore, comt
genotype effects on a variant of an episodic memory task
have been described in an aging adult population (de frias
et al, 2004). the presence of genotype effects on some tests
of executive cognition but not others may indicate a more
selective effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on circumscribed prefrontal
processing circuits strictly related to those tasks. we cannot
rule out, however, that the restricted genotype effects may
be due to a lack of statistical power in our sample.
the magnitude of the effects of  xxxd3395xxx  on the various
cognitive tests is small, consistent with earlier reports of the
effects of comt genotype in normal subjects on the same
tests, which generally have involved even larger samples.
there are undoubtedly many reasons for this, including the
cns potency of the drug and our relatively low dosing. the
most important factor, however, is that these subjects are
normal individuals without obvious deficits on the tasks
used. thus, there is a ‘ceiling effect’ on performance built
into this study, making the positive effects much more
remarkable. it is interesting to note that the effect sizes for
those tests that demonstrated improvements in the  xxxd3395xxx  condition ranged from 0.23 to 0.51 with a mean of
0.34. interestingly, we did not observe an effect of comt on
wisconsin card sort (wcst) performance, consistent with
evidence that comt genotype appears not to reliably
predict variation in wcst performance as it does in other
measures, such as the n back and ids stage of the id/ed
test (diaz-asper et al, 2005; egan et al, 2001; goldberg et al,
2003). the lack of an effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on wcst measures
also may be confounded by a strong order effect with this
task, such that taking it once dramatically alters the
cognitive demands of subsequent trials.
it is important to acknowledge that we performed a
number of tests in this study, based on earlier reports
of comt genotype effects on well-validated measures of
executive cognition and episodic memory, and none of our
cognitive results would survive statistical correction for
multiple comparisons. we could have restricted our
measures only to tests, for example n back and trails, that
have shown consistent earlier comt genotype effects, but
this did not seem appropriate to this ‘proof of concept’
pharmacological intervention. we do not believe that an
agnostic correction for multiple testing is an appropriate
procedure in this context because the tests were based on
very strong prior probability of effects and are strikingly
similar to what has been reported as the cognitive correlates
neuropsychopharmacology

of comt genotype. in our normal population, it is
reasonable to expect that in some of the tests measuring
cognitive functions unrelated to comt,  xxxd3395xxx  would
not induce statistically significant changes. the lack of
effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on comt-unrelated functional measures
provided further evidence on the specificity of the cognitive
tests in which this drug had a statistically significant effect.
by the same logic, differences in our results from earlier
studies with amphetamine are not surprising, given the
inevitability of cohort effects due to relatively small
samples, and to the global effect of amphetamine on other
biogenic amines and in brain regions other than cortex.
in contrast to the effects on cognition, the effect of
 xxxd3395xxx  on an fmri measure of prefrontal cortical
efficiency during executive cognitive processing was clear
and robust, and consistent with earlier main effects of
amphetamine. these results are in line with evidence in
experimental animals of a role of comt in cortical da
signaling. polymorphisms in the comt gene contribute to
the variability in the cortical responses to classic indirect
dopaminergic agonists (mattay et al, 2003). in fact, the
effects of amphetamine on prefrontal efficiency measured
with fmri (mattay et al, 2003) were more noticeable in
val/val individuals, a group with putatively higher comt
activity in the frontal cortex and, hence, relatively lower
dlfpc synaptic da concentrations. in line with these
findings, we expected that normal val/val individuals
would have a differentially greater improvement in dlpfc
physiological efficiency, working memory, and other
cognitive tasks related to frontal cortex executive function
after administration of  xxxd3395xxx . to some degree, our
neuropsychological data are consistent with this prediction.
a significant drug  genotype effect was observed in
measurements of intradimensional shifting and a trend
towards significance of this interaction was found in verbal
episodic memory, supporting the notion that trait differences in synaptic da in the dlpfc may be responsible for
this differential response between groups. we did not find,
however, a significant interaction of genotype on fmri
measures, as previously reported with amphetamine. for a
variety of reasons related to the differential pharmacology
of these drugs, noted above, direct comparisons of their
effects are limited.
the present study provides, to our knowledge, the first
evidence of enhancement of executive cognition and frontal
lobe function by a nonstimulant drug. the ability of
 xxxd3395xxx  to improve executive cognitive function putatively by selectively increasing da turnover in the
prefrontal and possibly temporal cortices provides a unique
example of ‘targeted’ pharmacology for the treatment of
cognitive disorders. the possibility that there may be
interactions with comt genotype that modify these effects
also illustrates that this novel pharmacological strategy may
also be genotype targeted. importantly, unlike psychostimulants, the improvement of cognitive function and
frontal lobe physiologic efficiency in normal volunteers is
not accompanied by changes in motor function or mood
status, implicating a lack of effect of the drug on the
mesolimbic and mesostriatal dopaminergic systems. this
regionally selective effect is consistent with studies in
animals (gogos et al, 1998; mazei et al, 2002; tunbridge
et al, 2004).
