the objective of this study was to examine the ocular hydrodynamic effects of topically and centrally
administered  xxxd2698xxx , alone and following pretreatment with pertussis toxin (ptx) and a2/i1
receptor antagonists. topically and intracisternally administered  xxxd2698xxx  was examined for its
ability to alter intraocular pressure (iop) of rabbits in the absence and presence of receptor antagonists
(rauwolscine, efaroxan) and a gi/o ribosylating agent ptx. in addition, the topical effects of  xxxd2698xxx 
on pupil diameter and aqueous humor ¯ow rate were evaluated. topical unilateral application of
 xxxd2698xxx  (7.5, 25 and 75 mg; 25 ml) elicited an ipsilateral dose-dependent mydriasis (2, 4 and
5.5 mm) that peaked at 2 hr with a duration of up to 5 hr. the iop decreases induced by  xxxd2698xxx 
were bilateral and dose-dependent (3, 6 and 10 mmhg); the response peaked at 1 hr and lasted for up to
5 hr. pretreatment with efaroxan (250 mg) elicited signi®cantly greater antagonism of the ocular
hypotensive response to  xxxd2698xxx  than did rauwolscine (250 mg) suggesting an involvement of
imidazoline (i1) receptors. intracisternal application of  xxxd2698xxx  (3.3 mg) also produced bilateral
reductions (6 mmhg) of iop that were immediate (10 min post drug) and lasted for approximately 2 hr.
in ptx-pretreated (2.5 mg kg ÿ1, i.a.) rabbits, the ocular hypotensive effects of  xxxd2698xxx  by both
routes (topically and centrally) were attenuated by 50±65 %. in addition to producing ocular hypotension, topical application of  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg; 25 ml) caused signi®cant reduction, from 2.8 to
1.5 ml min ÿ1, in aqueous humor ¯ow. these in vivo data indicate that, regardless of route of
administration, alteration of aqueous humor ¯ow by  xxxd2698xxx  was induced by the activation of a2
and i1 receptors. the ocular hypotensive effects produced by central administration did not result in
sedation, therefore, there is the suggestion that central a2 adrenergic receptors were stimulated
minimally by  xxxd2698xxx . thus, these data suggest that ocular hypotensive effects and suppression of
aqueous humor ¯ow rate by  xxxd2698xxx  are mediated, in part, by a2 and/or central i1 at both central
(brain) and peripheral (eye) sites. moreover, these data indicate that the receptors are linked to ptx# 2001 academic press
sensitive g(i/o) proteins.

1. introduction
compounds possessing imidazoline (e.g. meditomidine) or guanidinium (e.g. aganodine) moieties have
been shown to reduce intraocular pressure (potter and
ogidigben, 1991; ogidigben et al., 1996) and systemic
blood pressure (bousquet et al., 1989; head and
sannajust, 1992; chan, sannajust and head, 1996)
in humans and laboratory animals.  xxxd2698xxx , 2(1-naphthylmethyl)imidazoline was classi®ed originally as an  xxxg831xxx  adrenoceptor agonist but, in fact,
elicits a variety of pharmacological effects by interacting with several receptors, including alpha (a1 and a2)
adrenoceptors and imidazoline (i1) receptors. in
binding studies,  xxxd2698xxx  was among the most
selective drugs for a2a receptors in human platelets
(piletz, zhu and chikkala, 1996). moreover,  xxxd2698xxx  ranked third (regunathan et al., 1995) and fourth

(regunathan et al., 1996), respectively, among seven
drugs that inhibited 3h idazoxan binding in smooth
muscle and endothelial cells indicating signi®cant
af®nity for imidazoline sites. in human serum,
 xxxd2698xxx  weakly inhibited [3h]idazoxan binding
to anti-idazoxan antibodies (wang et al., 1997). the
ability of  xxxd2698xxx  to inhibit the binding of 2-(2benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline, a selective imidazoline
(i2) ligand to rat, guinea pig and rabbit brain
membrane homogenates suggested its af®nity for
i2 sites (hosseini et al., 1997).
because previous experiments in rabbits had
demonstrated the ocular hypotensive activity of
 xxxd2698xxx , the objectives of this study were to
investigate potential sites and mechanisms of action
by: (1) examining the modulatory effects of centrally
and peripherally administered  xxxd2698xxx  on iop;
(2) determining the involvement of a2 and imidazoline
(i1) receptors by pretreating with rauwolscine and
efaroxan, respectively, prior to challenge with  xxxd2698xxx ; (3) evaluating the effects of ptx pretreatment

on  xxxd2698xxx -induced responses thereby implicating
the involvement of gi/o protein in the naphazolineinduced reduction of iop; and (4) elucidating the
ocular hydrodynamic action of  xxxd2698xxx  by evaluating its effect on the ¯ow rate of aqueous humor.

2. materials and methods
animals
new zealand white (nzw) rabbits (oryctolagus
cuniculus) of either sex weighing 2.5±4.0 kg were
maintained on a 12 hr dark/light cycle. animals were
dark adapted, i.e. lights were off during the daylight
hours during which time these experiments were
conducted. intraocular pressure was measured in the
dark using special lighting conditions described previously (rowland, potter and reiter, 1981). performing all experiments at the same time of day minimized
variability related to diurnal rhythm. animal care and
treatment in this investigation were in compliance
with guidelines by the national institute of health
(nih) and the association for research in vision and
ophthalmology (arvo) resolution in the use of
animals for research. all experimental procedures
had prior approval by the institutional animal care
and use committee of morehouse school of medicine.
drug preparation and administration
the drugs used in this study and their
suppliers were:  xxxd2698xxx , 2-(1-naphthylmethyl)
imidazoline; efaroxan, (2-ethyl-2-[imidazolin-2-yl]2,3-dihydrobenzofuran)hydrochloride;
bordetella
pertussis toxin obtained from sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo, u.s.a.) and rauwolscine, obtained from
carl roth kg (karlsruhe, germany). the salt of each
agent was dissolved in sterile physiological saline on
each day of the experiment and the concentrations of
each drug are expressed as the active base. the choice
of vehicles for various drugs was necessitated by
adequate solubility of a particular drug (e.g. rauwolscine) in water versus saline.
in the intraocular pressure (iop) experiments
involving topical application,  xxxd2698xxx  and vehicle
solutions were administered unilaterally into the
conjunctival sac; efaroxan and rauwolscine solutions
were applied bilaterally prior to administration of
either  xxxd2698xxx  or vehicle. topical applications of
 xxxd2698xxx  were 25 ml with the contralateral (fellow) eyes receiving equal volumes of saline. in
experiments involving administration into the brain,
drug and vehicle solutions were applied into the
cisterna magna (intracisternally) in 10 ml volumes. a
masked technique was utilized in iop experiments
where the person involved in drug administration and
measurement of iop had no knowledge of the
solutions' contents.

intra-arterial injection of pertussis toxin
a sterile, ®ltered stock solution of ptx
(200 mg ml ÿ1) containing 50 % glycerol, 50 mm
sodium phosphate, 0.5 m nacl, ph 7.2, was stored
below 08c. on the day of injection, a portion of the
stock solution was diluted in a sterile, physiological,
saline solution into which 1 % sodium ¯uorescein was
added. in order to localize the injection of ptx as
much as possible into the ipsilateral eye, rabbits
were anesthetized with intramuscular (im) injection
of a mixture of ketamine (44 mg kg ÿ1), xylazine
(10 mg kg ÿ1) and  xxxd60xxx  (0.75 mg kg ÿ1)
body weight, for isolation of the common carotid
artery. validation and success of ¯uorescein/ptx
administration was conducted by examination of the
ipsilateral eye for ¯uorescein stain immediately
following the injection. subsequently, rabbits were
allowed 7 days to recover before topical application or
intracistemal injection of  xxxd2698xxx .
iop measurements
iop was measured using a bio-rad calibrated
digilab pneumatonometer model 30d and expressed
as millimeters of mercury (mmhg). before tonometry,
10 ml of 0.05 % proparacaine was applied to the
corneas to minimize any discomfort to the animal.
two base-line (control) readings were taken at ÿ0.5
and 0 hr after which drugs or vehicle were administered as described above. subsequent iop measurements were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr after
topically administered drug and 10, 20, 30, 60, 120
and 180 min following administration of drug
solutions into the cisterna magna. at the end of
each day's measurement, stability of the tonometer
was veri®ed using the calibrator veri®er supplied by
bio-rad. pupil diameter (mm) was measured horizontally using an optistick (allergan, irvine, ca,
u.s.a.) at the time of iop.
intracisternal catheter implantation and injection
method
for surgical implantation of intracisternal
catheters, nzw rabbits (2.5±4 kg) were anesthetized
with intramuscular (im) injection of a mixture
(1 cc kg ÿ1) of ketamine (44 mg kg ÿ1), xylazine
(10 mg kg ÿ1) and  xxxd60xxx  (0.75 mg kg ÿ1).
the procedure for surgery and implantation of the
catheter was performed according to the methods
described by head and sannajust (1992). on the day
of the experiment, animals were removed from their
cages and their catheters were ¯ushed with 20 ml
saline using a 50 ml syringe. subsequently, injection
of test drug and vehicle (10 ml) was made with a 27
gauge needle attached to a 50 ml hamilton glass
syringe. the syringe was mounted in an injector
applicator, the tridak stepper, calibrated to deliver

n a p h a z o l i n e - i n d u c e d s u p p r e s s i o n o f a q u e o u s h u m o r p r e s s u r e a n d f lo w

0.01 ml per division. the implanted catheter was
¯ushed with an equal volume of saline to insure
complete delivery of the drug into the cerebrospinal
¯uid (csf) in the cisterna magna.
measurement of aqueous humor flow rate
aqueous humor ¯ow rates were measured in
normal rabbit eyes, using ¯uorescein dilution as
quanti®ed by a fluorotron master (ocumetrics, palo
alto, ca, u.s.a.). this dye dilution procedure
employed the uniform stromal depot method for
¯uorescein introduced by yablonski et al. (1978).
the general method of ¯uorometric measurement of
¯uorescein concentration and calculation of aqueous
humor ¯ow rate have been described previously by
brubaker (1989). basal (control) recordings of ¯ow
rate were established in one of the experiments. the
following week, rabbit eyes of the same group were
treated bilaterally with  xxxd2698xxx , and ¯ow rates in
both eyes were determined. fluorometric recordings
started at 30 min after topical treatment with
 xxxd2698xxx , and subsequent recordings were made
at 1 hr intervals for 5 hr.
presentation and statistical analysis of data
the student's t-test for paired data were used to
evaluate drug-induced changes, except in cases where
more than two groups of data were compared, in
which case an analysis of variance (anova) (prism)
was performed. a probability level of 0.05 was
selected as the minimum level of signi®cance. data
presented in graphs, represent the mean + s.e.
3. results
effects of topical  xxxd2698xxx  on iop and pupil diameter
in normal and ptx pre-treated rabbits
intraocular pressure (iop) responses to  xxxd2698xxx 
were determined in normal and ptx pre-treated nzw,
dark-adapted rabbits. it has been demonstrated
previously that the sympathetic tone, camp levels
and iop are higher in dark-adapted than in light
adapted rabbits (rowland et al., 1981; chu, ogidigben and potter, 1996), enabling a larger range of
response during drug-induced lowering of iop.
 xxxd2698xxx  (7.5 mg), as shown in fig. 1, caused a
slight but signi®cant decrease (4.5 mmhg) in iop, an
intermediate dose of 25 mg produced a larger decrease
(9.0 mmhg) and the highest dose used in this study
(75 mg) elicited a maximum iop response of
10.5 mmhg at 1 hr. thus,  xxxd2698xxx  (7.5, 25
and 75 mg) elicited signi®cant, dose-dependent iop
decreases in both the ipsilateral [fig. 1(a)] and the
contralateral [fig. 1(b)] eyes of dark-adapted rabbits.
 xxxd2698xxx 's ocular hypotensive action lasted for up
to 5 hr at all the doses tested, in normal, dark-adapted

333

rabbits. there was no evidence of a transient
hypertensive phase in normal rabbits as has been
described for other a2 agonists, such as brimonidine
(burke and potter, 1986). the contralateral pressure
response was similar to the ipsilateral response in both
magnitude and duration of action. in ptx (2.5 mg
kg ÿ1, i.a.) pre-treated eyes, basal pressures were
slightly
lower
(24.8 mmhg)
than
normal
(25.9 mmhg), but this difference was not statistically
signi®cant. in contrast to normal rabbits,  xxxd2698xxx 
(75 mg) induced an initial transient ocular hypertensive effect in both ipsilateral and contralateral eyes
before a reduction occurred later in both eyes reaching a maximum of 3 mmhg at 2 hr (fig. 2). the
ocular hypotensive responses induced by  xxxd2698xxx 
at day 7 after ptx pre-treatment were 65 % less than
the responses of normal rabbits.
the pupillary response, a determinant of  xxxd2698xxx 's effect on iris function, was measured before and
after topical administration of  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg) in
conscious, normotensive rabbits (fig. 3). the mydriatic response to  xxxd2698xxx  in the ipsilateral (drugtreated eye) was immediate in onset, maximal at 2 hr
and had a duration of more than 5 hr. in contrast, the
response in the contralateral eye had a late onset that
occurred at 2 hr, peaked at 3 hr and lasted for more
than 5 hr. this mydriatic response was presumed to
be caused by the action of  xxxd2698xxx  on postjunctional a1 adrenoceptors located on the radial muscle
of the iris (murray and leopold, 1985).
effects of intracisternal (i.c.)  xxxd2698xxx  on iop in
normal and ptx pre-treated rabbits
 xxxd2698xxx  exhibited a bilateral reduction on iop
upon topical administration, therefore, it was hypothesized that the response could be mediated, in part, by
an action of the drug in the central nervous system. in
normotensive rabbits, the ocular hypotensive
responses elicited by  xxxd2698xxx  (3.3 mg, i.c.) were
bilateral and of immediate onset. iop was lowered
5 mmhg in both eyes at 5 min and lasted for about
120 min (fig. 4). intra-arterial pretreatment with
ptx, 7 days prior to experimentation, signi®cantly
inhibited (50±65 %) the lowering of iop by intracisternally
administered
 xxxd2698xxx 
(fig. 5)
suggesting involvement of a gi/o protein in the
response. intracisternal  xxxd2698xxx  did not elicit
signi®cant mydriatic response in this study.
antagonism of  xxxd2698xxx -induced ocular hypotension
by rauwolscine and efaroxan
rauwolscine is an antagonist that is relatively
selective for a2 receptors, whereas the antagonist
efaroxan, has greater selectivity for i1-preferring
receptors (ernsberger et al., 1992, 1993). these
inhibitors were chosen because  xxxd2698xxx  has
been suggested to have greater selectivity for a2

adrenoceptor receptors than i1 receptors, (devedjian
et al., 1994; piletz et al., 1996) but also has been
suggested to interact with purported l1 receptors
(regunathan et al., 1996). rauwolscine and efaroxan,
when administered alone, have been demonstrated to
have minimal effects on iop in rabbits (ogidigben,
chu and potter, 1994). in this study, topical, bilateral
pre-treatment with rauwolscine (250 mg) 30 min
before a challenge with  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg, topically
and unilaterally) inhibited the iop lowering effects of
 xxxd2698xxx  by 60 % in the ipsilateral (drug-treated)
and contralateral (vehicle-treated) rabbit eyes. topical,
bilateral pre-treatment with efaroxan (250 mg),
antagonized  xxxd2698xxx -induced ocular hypotension

more completely (100 %) in the ipsilateral
( xxxd2698xxx -treated) eyes (fig. 6) than did rauwolscine. interestingly, the contralateral iop responses to
 xxxd2698xxx  were antagonized to an equivalent extent
by both rauwolscine and efaroxan (data not shown).
 xxxd2698xxx -induced changes in aqueous humor flow
rate
another aspect of the ocular hydrodynamic action
of  xxxd2698xxx  was examined using quanti®cation of
¯uorescein concentration in the aqueous humor over
time. fluorometric measurement of aqueous ¯ow rate
was performed in normal rabbits before and after

value was compared by paired t-test.

topical, bilateral treatment with  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg).
 xxxd2698xxx  reduced the aqueous humor ¯ow rate
signi®cantly from 2.6 to 1.5 ml min ÿ1 (p 5 0.05)
(fig. 7). thus, the lowering of iop by  xxxd2698xxx 
could be related, in part, to suppression of the
aqueous ¯ow rate.

4. discussion
the objectives of this mechanistic study were to: (1)
determine the ocular hypotensive activity of topically
and intracisternally administered  xxxd2698xxx  on iop
before and following pretreatment with receptor
antagonists and pertussis toxin; and (2) elucidate

other possible actions on ocular hydrodynamics by
examining the effects of  xxxd2698xxx  on aqueous ¯ow
rate in normal rabbits.
the results of this study, using centrally administered (i.c.)  xxxd2698xxx  to normal rabbits, agrees
with previous work from this laboratory utilizing

 xxxd2674xxx  and brimonidine (campbell and potter,
1995). in the former study, the results suggested that
imidazoline (l1) receptors in the central nervous
system are involved in lowering iop by agonists
with activity on a2/i1 receptors, such as  xxxd2674xxx .
unilateral, topical application of  xxxd2698xxx  lowered

f ig . 6. antagonism of  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg; topical, unilateral)-induced ocular hypotension by efaroxan (250 mg; topical)
and rauwolscine (250 mg; topical). iop responses of the ipsilateral eyes of normal nzw rabbits were recorded after topical,
bilateral pretreatment with: (1) efaroxan; or (2) rauwolscine in separate studies; followed 30 min thereafter with topical,
unilateral administration of  xxxd2698xxx  in each study. the average starting iop was 25.5 mmhg for the efaroxan study and

the same group of rabbits for the ®rst 2 hr (0, 1 and 2 hr) without  xxxd2698xxx  (pre-drug). at the end of the second hour,
rabbits were pretreated with  xxxd2698xxx  (75 mg; topical, bilateral) and aqueous ¯ow rate measurements were continued at one
hr intervals thereafter for another 3 hr (3, 4 and 5 hr, post-drug). *signi®cantly (p 5 0.05) different between  xxxd2698xxx  and

iop in normal, dark-adapted rabbit eyes dose
dependently (4.5, 9 and 10 mmhg) with no initial
transient hypertension, an effect previously observed
following topical ipsilateral applications of certain a2/
imidazoline agonists (i1) to eyes of light-adapted
rabbits (burke and potter, 1986; jin et al., 1991;
potter and ogidigben, 1991; ogidigben et al., 1994).
the lack of an initial hypertensive response to
 xxxd2698xxx  could be due to the fact that the intraocular pressure and sympathetic tone of dark-adapted
rabbits are elevated compared to light-adapted rabbits
(mclaren, brubaker and fitzsimon, 1996). intracistemal application of  xxxd2698xxx  produced a
bilateral, dose-dependent reduction in iop in darkadapted rabbit eyes with no initial transient hypertension; similar responses have been reported for
other centrally applied a2/i1 (ogidigben and potter,
1997).
con®rmation of receptor involvement in the iop
reduction by  xxxd2698xxx  was accomplished by using
rauwolscine and efaroxan, which are relatively
selective antagonists of a2 and imidazoline (i1)
receptors, respectively. topically applied rauwolscine
and efaroxan given alone cause minimal changes in
intraocular pressure in vivo (ogidigben et al., 1994).
partial antagonism of  xxxd2698xxx 's effect on iop by
rauwolscine suggests that topically applied  xxxd2698xxx  activated a2 adrenoceptors to cause a decrease in
iop whereas full antagonism by efaroxan indicates
that  xxxd2698xxx  can activate both a2 and i1 receptors
to effect a reduction in intraocular pressure.
ptx causes ribosylation of gi/o proteins, thereby
preventing dissociation of the alpha-subunit following
a ligand(agonist)±gi/o receptor interaction. this
action of ptx attenuates the pharmacological effects
of the agonists whose receptors are coupled to gi/o
proteins (ui, 1984; kaslow and burns, 1992; oharaimaizumi et al., 1992). the effects of ptx pretreatment on the function of ocular tissues in vitro (jin
et al., 1989) and in vivo (ogidigben et al., 1994) have
been demonstrated to interfere with the activities of
receptors negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase.
these data agree with a relatively recent in vivo
cardiovascular study utilizing rats that concluded that
imidazoline receptors in the cns are coupled to ptxsensitive gi/o proteins (takada et al., 1997). therefore, to determine whether  xxxd2698xxx 's activation of
a2/i1 receptors in the eye involved gi/o proteins,
rabbits were injected with ptx (2.5 mg kg ÿ1, i.a.) and
then challenged with  xxxd2698xxx  topically (75 mg)
and centrally (3.3 mg). the rabbits used in experiments involving ptx pretreatment were the same as
those used initially for the determination of central
and peripheral actions of  xxxd2698xxx  on iop (figs 1
and 3). ptx-pretreatment, as demonstrated, caused a
signi®cant attenuation of the ocular hypotensive
response to topically and intracisternally administered
 xxxd2698xxx  suggesting that gi/o proteins are likely to

m. j. ogidigben et al.

be linked to receptors involved in the expression of the
ocular hypotensive effect of  xxxd2698xxx .
the lowering of iop by  xxxd2698xxx  was accompanied by a reduction of aqueous humor ¯ow rate. the
effect of  xxxd2698xxx  on aqueous humor ¯ow rate was
utilized to examine possible sites and mechanisms of
action by which  xxxd2698xxx  induces changes in
ocular hydrodynamics. these data suggest that
 xxxd2698xxx  can act at ocular (iris-ciliary body) sites,
to reduce aqueous ¯ow rate and in the brain to lower
iop. moreover, inhibition of the ocular hypotensive
activity of  xxxd2698xxx  by rauwolscine and efaroxan
suggests that  xxxd2698xxx -induced iop reduction is
mediated by combined actions on i1 and a2 receptors
in the iris-ciliary body. the design of this study does
not permit localization of a precise site of action in the
brain. the mechanism responsible for the lowering of
iop by  xxxd2698xxx  is due, in part, to a reduction of
aqueous humor formation, and this effects appear to
involve a ptx-sensitive gi/o protein coupled to a2/i1
receptors.
