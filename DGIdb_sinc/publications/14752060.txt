atypical beta-adrenoceptor subtypes mediate relaxations of rabbit corpus cavernosum.  this study was performed to characterize the beta-adrenoceptor population in rabbit isolated corpus cavernosum (rbcc) by using nonselective and selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in functional assays.  xxxd2583xxx ,  xxxd3130xxx ,  xxxd2098xxx , and 8-hydroxy-5-[(1r)-1-hydroxy-2-[n-[(1r)-2-(rho-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]carbostyril (ta 2005) (3-100 nmol each) dose dependently relaxed the rbcc preparations. these relaxations were markedly reduced by n(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name; 10 microm) and 1h-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (odq) (10 microm), whereas the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor sq 22,536 [9-(2-tetrahydrofuryl) adenine] (10 microm) had no effect. in contrast, neither l-name nor odq affected the  xxxd2401xxx -induced rbcc relaxations, but sq 22,536 abolished this response. sildenafil (1 microm) significantly potentiated the relaxations induced by beta(2)-agonists without affecting the  xxxd2401xxx -evoked relaxations.  xxxd3142xxx  (10 microm) enhanced the relaxations elicited by  xxxd2401xxx  but had no effect on those induced by the selective beta(2) agonists. propranolol and (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1h-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ici 118,551) determined a rightward shift in the concentration-response curves to  xxxd2401xxx  in a noncompetitive manner with a reduction of maximum response at the highest antagonist concentration, with the slope values significantly different from unity. propranolol and ici 118,551 had no effect on the relaxations elicited by  xxxd2098xxx , ta 2005,  xxxd2583xxx , and  xxxd3130xxx . atenolol and 1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy) ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]- xxxd2400xxx  methanesulfonate (cgp 20712a) (0.1-10 microm) failed to affect the relaxations induced by all tested beta-adrenoceptor agonists. our study revealed the existence of two atypical beta-adrenoceptors in the rabbit erectile tissue.  xxxd2401xxx  relaxes the rabbit cavernosal tissue by activating atypical beta-adrenoceptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase pathway, whereas the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists relax the rbcc tissue through another atypical beta-adrenoceptor subtype coupled to  xxxd2738xxx  release from the sinusoidal endothelium.
