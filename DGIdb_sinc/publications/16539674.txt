abstract
we have recently shown that the l-opioid receptor [mor1, also
termed l-opioid peptide (mop) receptor] is associated with the
 xxxg1773xxx  ( xxxg1773xxx ), a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane. we further demonstrated that, in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells
co-expressing mor1 and  xxxg1773xxx , treatment with (d-ala2, me
phe4, glyol5)enkephalin (damgo) led to an increase in  xxxg1773xxx 
activity and an induction of receptor endocytosis, whereas
morphine, which does not induce opioid receptor endocytosis,
failed to activate  xxxg1773xxx . in contrast, a c-terminal splice variant of
the l-opioid receptor (mor1d, also termed mop1d) exhibited
robust endocytosis in response to both damgo and morphine
treatment. we report here that mor1d also mediates an
agonist-independent (constitutive)  xxxg1773xxx -activation facilitating

agonist-induced and constitutive receptor endocytosis. inhibition of  xxxg1773xxx  activity by over-expression of a dominant negative
 xxxg1773xxx  (npld2) blocked the constitutive  xxxg1773xxx  activation and
impaired the endocytosis of mor1d receptors. moreover, we
provide evidence that the endocytotic trafficking of the d-opioid
receptor [dor, also termed d-opioid peptide (dop) receptor]
and cannabinoid receptor isoform 1 (cb1) is also mediated by a
 xxxg1773xxx -dependent pathway. these data indicate the generally
important role for  xxxg1773xxx  in the regulation of agonist-dependent
and agonist-independent g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr)
endocytosis.

phospholipase d (pld), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (pc) to generate choline and phosphatidic acid (pa), is
assumed to play an important function in signal transduction,
membrane trafﬁcking, and cytoskeletal reorganization (liscovitch and cantley 1995; liscovitch et al. 1999). recently,
two mammalian plds ( xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx ) have been
identiﬁed (colley et al. 1997; kodaki and yamashita 1997;
park et al. 1997). subcellular fractionation studies have
demonstrated the presence of  xxxg1772xxx  in intracellular membranes, e.g. er, golgi, and vesicular compartment (colley
et al. 1997; lucocq et al. 2001), whereas  xxxg1773xxx  was shown
to be largely associated with the plasma membrane (colley
et al. 1997; park et al. 2001; o’luanaigh et al. 2002) and to
physically interact with various membrane receptors, e.g. the
 xxxg681xxx  receptor (slaaby et al. 1998) and
l-opioid receptor (koch et al. 2003). moreover, recent
studies implicated a role for  xxxg1773xxx  in regulating clathrincoated vesicle-mediated g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr)
endocytosis (shen et al. 2001; koch et al. 2003; bhattacharya et al. 2004; du et al. 2004).

for the l-opioid receptor, we have recently demonstrated
that agonist-induced and adp-ribosylation factor (arf)dependent  xxxg1773xxx  activation is a prerequisite for receptor
endocytosis and recycling affecting the development of opioid

tolerance (koch et al. 2003, 2004). interestingly, endogenous
opioids, as well as the synthetic peptide (d-ala2, me phe4,
glyol5)enkephalin (damgo), promote  xxxg1773xxx  activation and
rapid endocytosis of l-opioid receptors, whereas the highly
addictive drug morphine fails to promote  xxxg1773xxx -activation and
l-receptor endocytosis (koch et al. 2001, 2004). however, a
c-terminal splice variant (mor1d) of the l-opioid receptor
revealed receptor endocytosis after both damgo and morphine treatment (koch et al. 2001). this suggests that
morphine might be able to stimulate  xxxg1773xxx  activity via
interaction with the mor1d receptor. thus, in the present
study, we tested the effect of damgo and morphine treatment
on the mor1d-mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation. we demonstrate
that mor1d exhibits a constitutive  xxxg1773xxx -activation resulting
in a facilitation of agonist-dependent and agonist-independent
receptor internalization. furthermore, for the ﬁrst time, we
provide evidence that receptor-mediated  xxxg1773xxx -activation is
also required for the endocytosis of the d-opioid and
cannabinoid receptor isoform 1 (cb1) implicating a general
key role of  xxxg1773xxx  in the regulation of agonist-induced and
constitutive gpcr endocytosis.

materials and methods
epitope tagging and cloning of cdna
the mouse l-opioid receptor splice variant (mor1d), the rat
d-opioid receptor (dor), and the human cannabinoid receptor
(cb1) were tagged at the amino terminus with the ha epitope tag
sequence mypynvpnya using polymerase chain reaction and
then subcloned into the peak10 expression vector (edge bio
systems, gaithersburg, md, usa). dr s. ryu (pohang, south
korea) kindly provided the human  xxxg1773xxx  cdna subcloned into the
pcdna3.1 expression vector. the catalytically inactive (k758r)
 xxxg1773xxx  mutant (npld2) was constructed by pcr-mutagenesis and
subcloned into the pcdna3 expression vector.
generation of cell lines co-expressing ha epitope-tagged opioid
receptors (hamor1, hamor1d or hador) or cannabinoid
receptor (hacb1) and  xxxg1773xxx , or the catalyticall inactive
(k758r)  xxxg1773xxx  mutant (npld2)
cells were ﬁrst transfected with peak10 : hamor1, peak10 : hamor1d, peak10 : hador or peak10 : hacb1 plasmid containing  xxxd3041xxx  resistance using a modiﬁed calcium phosphate
precipitation method (koch et al. 2001). stable transfectants were
selected in the presence of 1 lg/ml  xxxd3041xxx  (sigma, deisenhofen, germany). to generate cell lines co-expressing hamor1,
hamor1d, hador or hacb1, and  xxxg1773xxx  or npld2, cells were
subjected to a second round of transfection with pcdna3 :  xxxg1773xxx  or
pcdna3 : npld2 containing the neomycin resistance gene by
using effectene (qiagen, hilden, germany), and selected in the
presence of 1 lg/ml  xxxd3041xxx  and 500 lg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (life
technologies, eggenstein, germany). the whole pool of resistant
cells was used without selection of individual clones. receptor
expression and  xxxg1773xxx  expression was monitored using receptor
ligand binding assays, pld activity assays and quantitative elisa

as described below. expression of npld2 was monitored by
confocal microscopy, revealing that over 90% of the transfected
cells expressed both the receptor and npld2. cell ﬁxation,
antibiotic incubations, and confocal microscopy were carried out
as previously described (koch et al. 2001, 2003).
radioligand binding assays
binding studies were performed on membranes prepared from stably
transfected cells. the dissociation constant (kd) and number of
[3h]damgo binding sites (bmax) were calculated by scatchard
analysis using at least six concentrations of [3h]damgo in a range
from 0.3 to 9 nm as previously described (koch et al. 2001). nonspeciﬁc binding was determined as radioactivity bound in the
presence of 1 lm unlabelled damgo.
pld assays
pld activity was determined using a transphosphatidylation assay
(kotter and klein 1999). human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells
expressing mor1d, dor or cb1, and/or  xxxg1773xxx  were kept in
serum-free optimem containing 1,2,3-[3h]glycerol (1 lci/ml;
speciﬁc activity 40 ci/mmol; american radiolabeled chemicals,
st louis, mo, usa) for 24 h in order to label phospholipids.
cells were then exposed to serum-free medium containing drugs
and 2% ethanol. the following drugs were added as aqueous
solutions, resulting in end concentrations of 1 lm damgo,
1 lm morphine, 1 lm [d-pen(2,5)]-enkephalin (dpdpe), 1 lm
{2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholino) methyl] pyrrolo-(1,2,3de)-1,4-bezoxazin-6-yl}(1-naphtylyl) methadone monomethanesulfonate (win 55 212-2), 1 lm phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx -13-acetate
(pma), 1 lm calphostin c, 5 lm chelerythrine or 25 lg/ml
brefeldin a (bfa) (all from sigma). during the assay, bfa was
added 15 min before pma or agonists. after 30 min of drug
treatment, cells were extracted in 2.5 ml of ice-cold methanol/water
(3 : 2, v : v). subsequently, 1.5 ml chloroform and 0.35 ml h2o
was added, and the lipid phase was separated by thin layer
chromatography using the lower phase of methanol : chloroform : water (10 : 10 : 9, v : v : v). individual phospholipids were
stained with iodine, identiﬁed by standards, and spots corresponding
to phosphatidylethanol (ptdetoh), pa and pc were isolated and
subjected to liquid scintillation counting. pld activity was
expressed as per cent [3h]ptdetoh of the total cellular pc
concentration.
quantitative internalization assay
receptor-expressing cells with and without co-expression of the
dominant negative  xxxg1773xxx  (npld2) were seeded at a density of
2 · 105 per well and grown onto poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well
plates overnight. after washing, cells were pre-incubated with 1 lg
afﬁnity-puriﬁed rabbit anti-ha antibody for 2 h in optimem 1
(life technologies) at 4c. cells were then treated as indicated with
1 lm damgo, 1 lm morphine, 1 lm dpdpe, 1 lm win 55 212-2
and/or 1 lm pma, in optimem for 60 min. to prevent receptors
from recycling back to the plasma membrane, the culture medium
was supplemented with 50 lm monensin. subsequently, cells
were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(1 : 1000, amersham, braunschweig, germany) for 2 h at room
temperature (25c). plates were developed with 250 ll of abts
solution (roche molecular biomedicals, mannheim, germany).

 xxxg1773xxx -activity facilitates gpcr endocytosis 367

after 10–30 min, 200 ll of the substrate solution from each well

microplate reader.

results

functional expression of l-opioid receptor splice variants
the l-opioid receptor isoforms mor1 and mor1d were
ha-epitope tagged and stably expressed with and without
 xxxg1773xxx  in hek293 cells (koch et al. 2001). hamor1 and
hamor1d expression was monitored by ligand binding
experiments and immunocytochemical analyses as previously
published (koch et al. 2001). the hek293 cells stably
expressing hamor1 or hamor1d receptors were subjected to a second round of transfection with pcdna3 :  xxxg1773xxx .
saturation binding experiments (n ¼ 3–5) revealed that the
afﬁnities (ki) to [3h]damgo and the numbers of binding
sites (bmax) of hamor1 and hamor1d were not altered
by the co-expression of  xxxg1773xxx .
agonist-selective endocytosis of l-opioid receptor splice
variants
hek293 cells stably expressing the n-terminal ha-tagged
mor1 and mor1d receptors were pre-incubated with antiha speciﬁc antibodies for 2 h at 4c in order to label cell
surface receptors. these cells were then treated with
damgo or morphine for 30 min at 37c. control cells
were incubated at 37c for 30 min in the absence of agonist
to examine whether these receptors may undergo constitutive
or tonic internalization. after 30 min of damgo treatment,
both l-opioid receptor isoforms exhibited robust (50–60%)
endocytosis (fig. 1). after exposure to morphine, only
hamor1d receptors revealed strong (50%) receptor endocytosis, whereas the hamor1 receptor was highly resistant
to morphine-induced endocytosis (fig. 1). moreover, it was
clearly demonstrated that only hamor1d but not
hamor1 receptor-expressing cells revealed a marked
constitutive receptor endocytosis (30%).
mor1d constitutively stimulates  xxxg1773xxx  activity in
hek293 cells
as agonist-mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation has been previously
described for the l-opioid receptor (koch et al. 2003), it
was reasonable to assume that agonist-stimulation of the
l-opioid receptor splice variant mor1d might also
activate  xxxg1773xxx . because mor1d receptors exhibit robust
endocytosis after damgo and morphine treatment
(fig. 1), the mor1d receptor was suggested to activate
 xxxg1773xxx , not only after damgo, but also after morphine
treatment. to test this hypothesis, we stably co-expressed
ha epitope-tagged mor1 or mor1d and human  xxxg1773xxx 
in hek293 cells. hek293 cells have been shown to
endogenously express  xxxg1773xxx  (rumenapp et al. 1997; meier

fig. 1 agonist-selective endocytosis of l-opioid receptor splice variants. hek293 cells expressing ha epitope-tagged mor1 and mor1d
were either not treated or treated with 1 lm damgo or 1 lm morphine
for 30 min at 37c as indicated. cell surface receptors were labelled
with affinity-purified rabbit anti-ha antibody followed by a peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit antibody. receptor internalization, quantified as
the percentage loss of surface receptors, was measured by elisa
as described in material and methods. data are presented as
means ± se of five independent experiments performed in duplicate.

et al. 1999), but the expression level is very low and
under the detection limit of the transphosphatidylation
assay (koch et al. 2003, 2004). thus, we stably coexpressed human  xxxg1773xxx  and monitored the expression by
pma-mediated  xxxg1773xxx -stimulation and pld-assay. activation of pkc by pma promoted a 4.5-fold increase in
 xxxg1773xxx  activity for both mor1- xxxg1773xxx - and mor1d-pld2expressing cells, demonstrating a similar expression level
of  xxxg1773xxx  for both cell lines. we then incubated mor1pld2- or mor1d- xxxg1773xxx -expressing hek293 cells for
30 min with the l-agonist damgo and determined the
relative pld activity. as shown in fig. 2(a), treatment of
mor1- xxxg1773xxx -expressing cells with the l-receptor selective
agonist damgo led to a 3-fold increase in the  xxxg1773xxx 
activity after 30 min compared with untreated mor1pld2 controls, whereas an incubation for 30 min with
morphine failed to induce activation of  xxxg1773xxx . in contrast,
mor1d- xxxg1773xxx -expressing cells exhibited marked  xxxg1773xxx 
activity after both damgo and morphine treatment.
however, in contrast to  xxxg1773xxx - or mor1- xxxg1773xxx -expressing
hek293 cells, mor1d- xxxg1773xxx -expressing cells already
revealed a high constitutive  xxxg1773xxx  activation (2-fold
increase in activity) even without agonist-treatment
(fig. 2a). remarkably, compared with the constitutive
 xxxg1773xxx -activation in mor1d- xxxg1773xxx -expressing cells, further
agonist-treatment resulted only in a slight additional
increase of  xxxg1773xxx -activity.
however, the observed damgo-induced portion of
 xxxg1773xxx  activation in mor1d- xxxg1773xxx -expressing cells was
opioid receptor mediated, because it could be blocked by the

agonist-induced and constitutive mor1d endocytosis is
decreased by co-expression of a catalytically inactive
mutant (k758r) of  xxxg1773xxx 
after over-expression of the k758r-negative mutant of
 xxxg1773xxx  in ha epitope-tagged mor1d cells (hamor1dnpld2), the damgo- and morphine-induced hamor1d
internalization was reduced by nearly 60% compared with
control cells expressing hamor1d alone (fig. 3), suggesting that over-expression of npld2 impairs receptor-mediated
 xxxg1773xxx  activation and subsequent receptor internalization.
furthermore, the constitutive endocytosis of hamor1d
receptors was also drastically reduced by the npld2
co-expression (fig. 3, 37c control), indicating the important role for  xxxg1773xxx  in the constitutive receptor endocytosis.

opioid antagonist naloxone (fig. 2b). furthermore,
damgo-mediated activation of  xxxg1773xxx  in mor1d-pld2expressing cells could not be blocked by the pkc-inhibitor
calphostin c, which was shown to completely block the
pma-stimulated and pkc-mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation
(fig. 2b). this indicates that activation of pkc seems not
to play a major role in the mor1d-induced  xxxg1773xxx  activation
in these cells. as pkc and/or arf-gtp proteins can
mediate  xxxg1773xxx  activation, we examined whether activation of
 xxxg1773xxx  by the opioid receptor variant mor1d involves arfgtp proteins. figure 2(b) shows that damgo-mediated
activation of  xxxg1773xxx  was completely blocked by the arf
inhibitor bfa, indicating that agonist-induced  xxxg1773xxx  activation by the mor1d receptor is arf-dependent. in control
experiments, bfa had no effect on the pma-induced  xxxg1773xxx 
activation (data not shown).

general role for  xxxg1773xxx  in the regulation of gpcr
endocytosis
to analyse whether receptor-mediated activation of  xxxg1773xxx  is
also involved in the endocytosis regulation of other gpcrs
than the l-opioid receptor, we expressed ha epitope-tagged
 xxxg479xxx  (hacb1) or  xxxg1632xxx 
(hador) with and without  xxxg1773xxx  in hek293 cells.
comparable with the l-opioid receptor splice variant
mor1d, in hek293 cells expressing the hacb1 receptor
or hador and  xxxg1773xxx , we detected both a constitutive and
agonist-mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation (figs 4a and 5a). agonists
used were win 55 212-2 and dpdpe for speciﬁc stimulation
of cb1 and hador, respectively. those agonist-mediated
 xxxg1773xxx  activations were speciﬁcally blocked by the cb1receptor antagonist n-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-1h- xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxamide

agonist-mediated dor- and cb1-receptor endocytosis
(figs 4b and 5b). co-expression of cb1 or dor and
catalytically inactive n- xxxg1773xxx  led to a strong reduction of
both agonist-induced and constitutive receptor endocytosis,
suggesting an important role of  xxxg1773xxx  in the regulation of
gpcr endocytosis.
discussion

pld is a widely distributed enzyme found in bacteria, fungi,
plants and animals. its principle substrate is phosphatidylcholine and its product, phosphatidic acid, is believed to have
many different functions in signal transduction, vesicle
formation and cytoskeletal dynamics (liscovitch and cantley
1995; liscovitch et al. 1999). there are two mammalian

pld isoforms ( xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx ) which occur as splice
variants (liscovitch et al. 2000; exton 2002).  xxxg1772xxx  appears
to be localized to the golgi or perinuclear vesicular
structures, whereas  xxxg1773xxx  appears to be associated with the
plasma membrane (liscovitch et al. 1999).  xxxg1772xxx  seems to
play a role for the vesicle formation from the golgi apparatus
(ktistakis et al. 1996) and  xxxg1773xxx  has been suggested to be
involved in vesicle formation from the plasma membrane
(colley et al. 1997).  xxxg1772xxx  can be activated by arf, rho,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and protein kinase c
(pkc) (lee et al. 1997; exton 2002), whereas  xxxg1773xxx  is
predominantly activated by arf (exton 2002; koch et al.
2003). furthermore, pld-activity has been shown to be
regulated by a number of gpcrs including the vpac 1 and
2 (for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) receptors and  xxxg71xxx 
(for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide) receptor
(mcculloch et al. 2001), metabotropic glutamate receptors
(shinomura et al. 2000; kanumilli et al. 2002; bhattacharya
et al. 2004), m1-m4 muscarinic receptors (sandmann et al.
1991), the endothelin receptor (ambar and sokolovsky
1993), the a2-adrenergic receptor (macnulty et al. 1992), d2
dopamine receptor (senogles 2000) and l-opioid receptor
(koch et al. 2003). however, the mechanisms of pld
activation by gpcrs, as well as the cellular functions of
activated pld, are still incompletely understood. recent
publications implicated an involvement of receptor-mediated
 xxxg1773xxx  activation in the regulation of receptor endocytosis
(shen et al. 2001; koch et al. 2003; bhattacharya et al.
2004; du et al. 2004). the present study provides evidence
for an essential role of  xxxg1773xxx  in the agonist-induced and
constitutive endocytosis of various gpcrs, namely the
l-opioid receptor splice variant mor1d, the d-opioid
receptor (dor) and the cannabinoid (cb1) receptor.  xxxg1773xxx 
was shown to be constitutively activated by the co-expression of mor1d, cb1 or dor (figs 2a, 4a and 5a) inducing
constitutive receptor endocytosis (figs 2b, 4b and 5b).
agonist treatment resulted in a further elevation of  xxxg1773xxx 
activity, which could be blocked by receptor speciﬁc
antagonists and by the arf-inhibitor bfa (figs 2b, 4a and
5a), but not by pkc-inhibitors calphostin c or chelerythrine.
these results indicate that the mor1d-, dor- and cb1mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation after agonist treatment is arf
dependent and that pkc is not required. this is in line with
other ﬁndings, that d2- and l-opioid receptor-mediated
 xxxg1773xxx  activation is arf and not pkc dependent (senogles
2000; koch et al. 2003). presumably, the  xxxg187xxx  protein,
which has been demonstrated to selectively activate  xxxg1773xxx 
in vivo (hiroyama and exton 2005), might be involved in the
gpcr-mediated  xxxg1773xxx  activation. this assumption is supported by recent ﬁndings that  xxxg187xxx  protein plays an
essential role in the endocytosis regulation of gpcrs
sequestered via the clathrin-coated pathway (claing 2004;
houndolo et al. 2005). thus, it is possible that the gpcrmediated  xxxg1773xxx  stimulation may involve a direct interaction

of receptors with arf protein. the npxxy motif, which is
highly conserved within the seventh transmembrane domain
of many gpcrs, including the l-opioid receptor, d-opioid
receptor and  xxxg479xxx , was previously demonstrated to represent a speciﬁc arf binding site implicated
in receptor-mediated pld activation (mitchell et al. 1998).
mutations of this npxxy motif have been demonstrated to
prevent ligand-induced endocytosis of gpcrs, including
the d-opioid receptor and the type 2 vasopressin receptor
(kramer and simon 1999; bouley et al. 2002). moreover, we
recently demonstrated the co-immunoprecipitation of arf
with the mor1- xxxg1773xxx  complex in hek293 cells, indicating
the tight interaction between opioid receptors, arf protein
and  xxxg1773xxx  (koch et al. 2003). thus, it seems reasonable to
speculate that agonist-induced endocytosis of many gpcrs
might be generally regulated via interaction with arf/ xxxg1773xxx 
proteins. in contrast metabotropic glutamate receptors that do
not have a npxxy motif have been demonstrated to activate
 xxxg1773xxx  in an arf-independent pathway (shinomura et al.
2000; kanumilli et al. 2002; bhattacharya et al. 2004).
but how can  xxxg1773xxx  activation regulate gpcr endocytosis? in addition to the early evidence that b-arrestins play an
important role in receptor desensitization by preventing
g-protein binding, it has been elucidated that they also
function as endocytic adapters, linking receptors to the
clathrin-coated pit machinery (shenoy and lefkowitz 2003;
claing 2004). thus, interaction of b-arrestins with endocytotic elements including clathrin and the adapter protein 2
(ap-2) are important for induction of clathrin-dependent
gpcr endocytosis (laporte et al. 2002). interestingly, it has
been shown that the recruitment of the ap-2 adapter
complex is also facilitated by phosphatidic acid, the
metabolite of pld activation (liscovitch and cantley
1995; arneson et al. 1999). pa is known to extensively
activate type i phosphoinositide-4-phosphate 5-kinases in
mammalian cells, resulting in an increased phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [ptdins(4,5)p2] level of the membrane (jones et al. 2000; ling et al. 2002). clathrin,
dynamin and proteins of the ap-2 adapter complex contain
domains that mediate their binding to ptdins(4,5)p2-containing membranes [reviewed in mousavi et al. (2004)].
thus, receptor endocytosis might be regulated by both
gpcr binding to b-arrestin and gpcr-mediated  xxxg1773xxx 
activation resulting in the subsequent recruitment and/or
interaction with components of the ap-2 complex. in
addition, an increase in the level of pa after  xxxg1773xxx  activation
results in a change of the physical properties, e.g. charge and
ph, of cellular membranes, thereby facilitating vesicle
formation. thus, it can be suggested that activation of
 xxxg1773xxx  may be a general key step during the induction of
gpcr endocytosis. in fact, the present study revealed that
 xxxg1773xxx  activity is essential for both constitutive and agonistdependent mor1d-, dor- and cb1-receptor endocytosis.

 xxxg1773xxx -activity facilitates gpcr endocytosis 371

resulted in a loss of both agonist-dependent and constitutive
endocytosis, indicating the requirement of  xxxg1773xxx  activity for
induction of gpcr endocytosis. moreover, these results
clearly demonstrate that agonist-independent  xxxg1773xxx  activation provides an important alternative mechanism to barrestin for the regulation of constitutive endocytosis of
gpcrs.
