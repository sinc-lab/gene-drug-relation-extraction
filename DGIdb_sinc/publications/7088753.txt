summary
the effects of  xxxd193xxx  were compared with aspirin
and placebo on platelet aggregation and on the
diuretic action of  xxxd2167xxx  in normal volunteers.
aspirin significantly reduced platelet aggregation at
3 and 6 hr after administration, but  xxxd193xxx  only
at 3 hr. only aspirin significantly reduced the increase
in urine sodium and potassium produced by  xxxd2167xxx .

 xxxd193xxx , an  xxxd189xxx  ester derivative,
is an analgesic agent which inhibits prostaglandin
synthesis and has some anti-inflammatory properties
(wisanto et al., 1981). other anti-inflammatory
analgesics such as aspirin have been shown to
inhibit, at least in part, the diuretic action of
 xxxd2167xxx  (henry, 1980) and to inhibit platelet
aggregation (zuckerand peterson, 1968). the authors
have compared the effects of  xxxd193xxx  and aspirin
on platelet aggregation and  xxxd2167xxx -induced
diuresis in normal human volunteers.
material and methods
six healthy volunteers (5 male, 1 female) aged
20-22 years participated in the study. a history of
peptic ulcer, analgesic-induced asthma and other
chronic illness was excluded in all subjects, who
abstained from use of any medication for at least
one week before the study and from smoking on
the days of the study. after a light breakfast of
toast and fruit-juice they were given with 100ml
water the following treatments at weekly intervals
in a double-blind randomized order based on 2
latin squares, using a double-dummy technique:
(a) aspirin 600 mg in a capsule; (b)  xxxd193xxx 
300 mg as two 150 mg tablets; (c) matching capsule
and tablet placebos.
one hour after this treatment  xxxd2167xxx  20 mg as a
tablet was given.

the bladder was emptied before  xxxd2167xxx 
ingestion and a urine aliquot collected. all urine
passed was then collected at hourly intervals for 7
hr, and urine volume, na+ and k+ estimated.
nine-millilitre blood samples were collected
immediately before each analgesic treatment or
placebo, and at 3 and 6 hr later into 1-ml 3 8 % trisodium citrate solution.
platelet-rich plasma was prepared as the supernatant after centrifugation at 120 g for 5 min. the
remainder was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min to
prepare platelet-poor plasma. platelet aggregation
was measured in a payton-dual aggregometer using

results
urinary estimations
aspirin significantly (p=0 05) reduced the  xxxd2167xxx -induced increase in sodium excretion at 2 and
3 hr, and potassium excretion at 2 hr (fig. 1), but
had no significant effect on urine volume.  xxxd193xxx  had no significant influence on either electrolyte excretion or urine volume.

platelet aggregation
both aspirin and  xxxd193xxx  inhibited adpinduced platelet aggregation at 3 hr (p < 005), but
only aspirin had a significant inhibitory effect at
6 hr (p < 005) (table 1).

discussion
the mechanism underlying the inhibitory influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
on the diuretic and anti-hypertensive effects of
 xxxd2167xxx  and thiazide diuretics is still uncertain.
although a pharmacokinetic mechanism may be
present (benet, 1979), it is also possible that the
interaction involves inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis in the kidneys (patak et al., 1975; abe
et al., 1978). platelet aggregation is also thought to
involve prostaglandin activity, and the anti-aggregatory effect of aspirin to involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. this effect is permanent because
aspirin irreversibly acetylates the platelet cyclooxygenase enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis (roth et al., 1977). platelet aggregation does
not then return to normal until a new generation of
platelets have entered the circulation (marian,
packham and mustard, 1980).
 xxxd193xxx  appears to differ from aspirin in
certain important aspects. firstly, although it has a
marked inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation at
3 hr after administration, comparable to the effect of
aspirin, this effect has disappeared at 6 hr while

of aspirin, as expected, is unchanged.
in the platelet, therefore, appear to be
in comparison with the irreversible
aspirin. secondly, while aspirin has a
significant inhibitory effect on the sodium and
potassium excretion induced by  xxxd2167xxx ,  xxxd193xxx  had no measurable effect under the conditions
of this study, although such an effect in larger doses
cannot be excluded. it can be concluded, however,
that doses of aspirin and  xxxd193xxx  with similar
effects on platelet aggregation at 3 hr after ingestion
had markedly different effects on  xxxd2167xxx -induced
sodium and potassium excretion. the dose of
 xxxd193xxx  used, 300 mg, had been shown to be an
effective analgesic in preliminary clinical testing
(a. hedges and p. turner, personal communication)
and in controlled double-blind clinical trials
(wisanto et al., 1981).
the clinical importance of these pharmacological
differences has yet to be explored. bown et al.
(1980) found that faecal blood loss after 7 days'
treatment with  xxxd193xxx  450 and 900 mg daily
was similar to that after placebo and significantly
less than that after aspirin 1800 mg daily, but
experience of its use is still too limited to conclude
that it produces fewer episodes of major blood loss.
there is little doubt that anti-inflammatory drugs
such as aspirin and indomethacin can antagonize the
effects of diuretics and precipitate heart failure
(turner and warrington, 1980).
it will be interesting to see if the absence of
interaction of  xxxd193xxx  with  xxxd2167xxx  in this
single-dose volunteer study truly predicts a lack of
this action in the clinical situation.
