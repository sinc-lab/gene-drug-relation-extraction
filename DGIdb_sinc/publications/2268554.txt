inhibitory effect of synthetic progestins, 4-ma and cyanoketone on human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene-isomerase activity.  human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-hsd) purified from human placenta transforms c-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as c-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids.  xxxd3436xxx , epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-hsd with ki values of approximately 50 nm. 4-ma, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-hsd with a ki value of 56 nm. synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and ru2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with ki values of 110 and 190 nm, respectively.  xxxd1786xxx , a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as  xxxd2754xxx  and  xxxd2751xxx  that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-hsd activity at ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microm, respectively.
