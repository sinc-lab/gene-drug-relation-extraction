u- a 9-year-old girl was evaluated for behavioral changes and seizures. initial computerized tomography and
cerebral angiography revealed a left cerebral vascular mass, diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation. an
embolization procedure was attempted but was terminated before completion because the patient developed a
right hemiparesis. her fight-sided neurological deficit subsequently increased with enlargement of the mass
lesion. on follow-up cerebral angiography approximately 2 years later the vascular maltbrmation was no
longer demonstrated. biopsy of the mass lesion revealed it to be an anaplastic astrocytoma. this case is
reported with a review of the literature on the coexistence of a brain tumor and a vascular malformation, the
difficulties in diagnosis, and possible etiologies.

arely is there confusion in differentiating a
brain t u m o r with a b n o r m a l vasculature from
an arteriovenous m a l f o r m a t i o n (avm) of the
brain. this report describes a 9-year-old girl in whom a
left cerebral mass lesion, initially diagnosed a n d treated
as an avm, was subsequently proved f r o m biopsy
e x a m i n a t i o n to be an astrocytoma. this case raises
several questions as to the possible etiology: that is, the
coexistence o f two separate lesions, the evolution of
one lesion into the other, a single "multipotential"
lesion, or misdiagnosis.
case report
this 9-year-old caucasian girl started to tire easily
a n d her face occasionally b e c a m e "beet red" beginning
in september, 1983. in n o v e m b e r , 1983, she developed
a seizure. a l u m b a r puncture showed clear colorless
cerebrospinal fluid (csf). a computerized tomography
(ct) brain scan on n o v e m b e r 15, 1983, showed a
contrast-enhancing lesion in the left centrosylvian region, with draining veins into the vein o f galen and
straight sinus (fig. 1). there was a large low-density
area in the left middle fossa consistent with csf, believed to be a dilated trapped temporal horn of the left

lateral ventricle. there was a slight midline shift from
left to right. bilateral cerebral and left vertebral angiography (fig. 2) performed on n o v e m b e r 16 revealed
vascular m a l f o r m a t i o n with some mass effect in the left
centrosylvian region, being fed primarily by the left
anterior choroidal artery, left lenticulostriate branches
of the insular loops of the left middle cerebral artery,
left medial a n d lateral choroidal artery, branches o f the
left posterior cerebral artery, and (to a lesser extent)
the left thalmoperforating artery. primary drainage was
into the vein o f galen and straight sinus. this constellation of findings was considered compatible with an
avm of the left cerebrum. anticonvulsant medication
was initiated.
in january, 1984, follow-up ct revealed a slightly
increased left-to-right shift of the midline, but the
appearance was otherwise essentially similar to the
changes seen in n o v e m b e r , 1983. the patient was
referred for embolization of the avm. t h e procedure
was terminated when, during two test balloon inflations, she developed a right hemiparesis.
in june, 1984, a fight visual field defect was d e m o n strated. in july, repeat c t without contrast enhancem e n t showed enlargement o f the left cerebral lesion,

the left cerebral mass lesion; however, serial follow-up
c t scans demonstrated progressive enlargement of the
left cerebral mass lesion.
in august, 1985, it had b e c o m e apparent to the parents that the patient's condition was deteriorating, primarily manifested by withdrawal from activities and
apathetic mood. by september, her speech had become
m o r e hesitant and on occasion she would stop speaking
in the middle o f a sentence. left carotid and left vertebral angiography on september 10 showed hypovascularity of the mass. the previously demonstrated abnormal vascular pattern was not present (fig. 3). a
post-angiography ct scan delineated the left cerebral
mass lesion (fig. 4).

on september 12, 1985, the patient underwent a left
temporal craniotomy with subtotal resection of the
mass. multiple fine vessels traversed the tumor, but no
avm was seen within the operative field. histological
examination disclosed foci of mild to moderate astrocytic proliferation, irregular dilated sinusoidal vascular
channels, and an increased n u m b e r of small arterioles
and veins. p a r e n c h y m a adjacent to blood vessels was
sparsely cellular with abundant rosenthal fibers and
hemosiderin pigment. other areas had astrocytic proliferation and pleomorphism (fig. 5).
six months later (in march, 1986) the patient underwent a second subtotal resection when her condition
acutely deteriorated following a probable seizure. a c t
scan at that time evidenced further enlargement of the
tumor. the histological diagnosis was increased cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, and vascular proliferation consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma.

review of literature
coexistence of a vascular malformation and an intracerebral brain t u m o r is an infrequent occurrence.
review o f the literature discloses 13 previously reported
cases (table 1). in 1958, white, et al., 2~ in their review
of intracranial vascular tumors found at necropsy, included a patient with a left temporal lobe cavernous
h e m a n g i o m a and an astrocytoma of the septum pellucidum. fine, et al., 4 in 1960 described a 15-year-old
boy with a right parietal a v m and an intraventricular
oligodendroglioma. they believed that the coexistence
of the two lesions in the same patient was fortuitous.
in 1966, welcher and seidep 9 described a patient with
two discrete lesions in the same hemisphere: an avm

and an astrocytoma. the brain tumor, discovered at
necropsy, had not been suspected during life. they
considered their report o f coexisting lesions to be the
first, apparently unaware o f the reports of fine, et al.,
or white, et al. in 1965, r a y n o r and kingman ~4 reported a patient with a hemangioblastoma and a vascular malformation occurring as one lesion. these authors credit themselves with presenting the first case of
two intermixed lesions within the same mass, as welt as
the demonstration of an increase in size and vascularity of the lesion. in 1971, heffner, et al.,8 reported a patient whose initial radiographic study suggested "vascular glioma;" however, surgery' disclosed a nonvascular
astrocytoma and a "typical a v m . " crowell, et at., 2
described a patient who presented with subarachnoid
hemorrhage (sah) and whose angiogram showed an
avascular mass; an oligodendroglioma and avm were
disclosed at the same site. zuccarello, et al., "-~ reported
the case o f a patient with an intermixed avm and
malignant astrocytoma. they suggested that the association of a t u m o r and vascular malformation represented a definite entity and not a coexistence of individual lesions. in 1982, fischer, et al., 5 described two
patients with glial neoplasms and cavernous hemangiomas. in one o f these, the lesions were combined and
coexistent; in the other, an oligodendroglioma apparently subsequently grew at the same site as the hemangioma. chee, et al., ~ reported a case of coexisting
oligodendroglioma and angioma in which the ct scan
had not shown the angioma. an interesting case is that
o f martinez-lage, et a l , ~2 in which the sah is believed
to have originated from the intraventricular oligodendroglioma rather than the parietal avm. licata, et
al., ~ reported two patients with central nervous system (cns) parenchymal tumors and avm's; one had
coexistent lesions while the other patient's tumor appeared subsequently at the site o f the former angioma.
o f these 14 cases, including ours, the vast majority
(11 patients) had simultaneous occurrence or coexistence of the two lesions, whereas three apparently
showed subsequent development o f a t u m o r at the same
site as the previously diagnosed vascular malformation
(table 2). a m o n g the 11 simultaneously occurring lesions, six were coexistent but separate within the same
hemisphere,8.1h2,~9 ipsilateral ventricle, 5 or septum pellucidum 2~ and five were coexistent but combined or
intermixed. ~4 in the remaining three patients, tumors
were found at varying periods o f time after the initially
diagnosed vascular lesion: 5 years, 5 30 months, ~ and
22 months (our case).
a separate group of combined or coexistent neural
tumors and vascular malformations is that of peripheral
nervous system neurilemomas and angiomas reviewed
in 1979 by kasantikul and netskyfl they described
eight cases o f their own in addition to five culled from
the literature and proposed that a c o m m o n embryological origin from ectomesenchyme could explain their
simultaneous occurrence. we have not included this
group in our tabulation, since we are concerned with

intracranial cns parenchymal tumors and associated
vascular lesions.
other features include an age range at occurrence
from 11 to 25 years in patients with oligodendrogliomas
and vascular malformations, with the only exception
being a 43-year-old man. in cases in which the patient's
sex was known, the majority were male: all five cases
of oligodendroglioma and four of five cases of astrocytoma.
etiology

and diagnosis

the question raised by the present case report is that
of the possible occurrence of two different cns lesions,
either simultaneously or sequentially within the same
patient, or the existence throughout the clinical course
o f only one lesion. difficulties encountered in pathological and radiological interpretations can thwart a
clear resolution of the issue. the gross and histological
features of brain tumors (gliomas) and vascular malformations have m a n y similarities. in 1937, trnnis ~s first
described arteriovenous shunting and abnormal blood
vessels observed at surgery for a glioblastoma multiforme. since then, other vascular changes within malignant gliomas have been well described ~3 and include: increased small blood vessels, mainly capillaries,
excessively convoluted masses of capillaries ("glomeruloids'); sinusoidal channels; and prominent endothelial and adventitial proliferation affecting all sizes of vessels. tortuous ectatic vessels, aneurysmal dilations, and
arteriovenous anastomoses with early draining veins
as well as thrombosed vessels in varying stages of organization and recanalization may be seen in both tumors

and vascular malformations. the avm, particularly,
can exhibit any or all of these features, in addition to
abnormally structured arteries and veins.
radiographic vascular changes of tumors can overlap
with those of vascular malformations, causing diagnostic confusion. the presence o f abnormal afferent and
efferent blood vessels and arteriovenous shunting of
blood, in the absence o f mass effect and edema, usually
leads to the radiographic diagnosis o f an avm. difficulty may arise in differentiating an avm which was
ruptured with h e m a t o m a formation from a t u m o r with
mass effect. kumar, et al, ~~ reviewed 60 cases o f clinically ruptured avm's, in which high-resolution ct
demonstrated local or remote mass effect in 33 patients.
there are similarities between the c t scan appearance
o f their cases, as illustrated in their figs. 1 and 3, and
the ct scan findings in our case. vascular malformations may simulate tumors, showing high density on
noncontrast ct but not appearing on angiography (socalled "cryptic" angiomas, now more readily appreciated by a characteristic magnetic resonance (mr) image
appearance). by contrast, a recent report by rigamonti,
et al., ~ describes a patient with a right frontal venous
malformation diagnosed by angiography, ct, and mr
imaging who 1 year later developed a glioblastoma in
the same site. they suggested that the initial studies did
not exclude the possibility that the venous malformation represented a rather p r o m i n e n t venous drainage of
the subsequently diagnosed gliobtastoma.
multiple etiologies for the association of vascular
malformations and tumors within the same patient
have been proposed. these include: fortuitous association; 4'~-~genetic predisposition; 2~ a distinct entity, possibly of viral origin, with biological potential to evolve
along different lines; 5 a secondary or reactive neoplastic glial change to a previously existing vascular malformation; 2j and the influence o f a t u m o r angiogenesis factor. 6,7,~7 another theory was that of russell and
rubinstein,~6 who rejected the concept of two different
lesions, diagnosing instead either "hypervascularized
t u m o r or undue glial reaction." since concomitant
histopathological sampling and radiographic studies
throughout the duration o f these lesions have not been
performed in any of these cases, these proposals remain
speculative.
o f the cases reviewed, a vascular malformation was
not initially diagnosed by angiography in five of 11
cases 3'5'8"j4 or with ct ~,5,~'~2 (table 3). in a case cited
by heffner, et al., 8 the angiographic pattern of abnormal vasculature associated with a frontal mass was
considered to be a "vascular glioma." in the two cases
of fischer, et al., 5 the initial angiograms were normal
in one and showed mass effect but no "pathologic
vessels, early draining veins, or t u m o r blush" in the
other. in the six cases in which the vascular malformation was diagnosed by angiography, a separate mass
lesion was suspected in only two: by ventriculogram in
one 4 and by ct in the other. 12
in the present case, the angiographically abnormal
804

vessels, initially felt to represent an avm, regressed and
disappeared over a period of 22 months. within the
same period a progressively enlarging hypovascular
mass developed at the same site. two biopsies with
subtotal resection, obtained 6 months apart, confirmed
a diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma without evidence
of a vascular malformation. it is the our contention
that this case represents an avm in which a malignant
(anaplastic) astrocytoma grew, replacing the avm.
we realize that this case may just as well represent a
single lesion (anaplastic astrocytoma) in which the vascular pattern initially simulated the angiographic appearance of an avm. it is suggested that future research
may include, a m o n g other goals, the search for a t u m o r
angiogenetic factor in resected vascular malformations
in the hope of defining a possible relationship between
the two lesions.
