abstract
the histamine  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) is involved in the chemotaxis
of leukocytes and mast cells to sites of inflammation and is
suggested to be a potential drug target for asthma and allergy.
so far, selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonists have not been identified. in the
present study, we therefore evaluated the human  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx )
for its interaction with various known histaminergic ligands.
almost all of the tested  xxxg1078xxx  and  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists, including
several important therapeutics, displaced less than 30% of
specific [3h]histamine binding to the  xxxg1081xxx  at concentrations up
to 10 ␮m. most of the tested  xxxg1079xxx  agonists and imidazolebased  xxxg1080xxx  ligands show micromolar-to-nanomolar range  xxxg1081xxx 
affinity, and these ligands exert different intrinsic  xxxg1081xxx  activi-

histamine exerts many (patho-)physiological effects
through its interaction with four histamine receptor subtypes
that all belong to the family of g protein-coupled receptors
(hough, 2001). the histamine  xxxg1078xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx ) and h2
receptor ( xxxg1079xxx ) were pharmacologically identified long before
their cdnas were cloned (gantz et al., 1991; yamashita et

ties, ranging from full agonists to inverse agonists. interestingly,
we identified 4-methylhistamine as a high-affinity  xxxg1081xxx  ligand
(ki ⫽ 50 nm) that has a ⬎100-fold selectivity for the  xxxg1081xxx  over
the other histamine receptor subtypes. moreover, 4-methylhistamine potently activated the  xxxg1081xxx  (pec50 ⫽ 7.4 ⫾ 0.1; ␣ ⫽ 1),
and this response was competitively antagonized by the selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj 7777120 [1-[(5-chloro-1h-indol-2-yl)carbonyl]-4-methylpiperazine] (pa2 ⫽ 7.8). the identification of
4-methylhistamine as a potent  xxxg1081xxx  agonist is of major importance for future studies to unravel the physiological roles of the

for more than two decades. the cdna encoding the histamine  xxxg1080xxx  was cloned more recently (lovenberg et al., 1999),
and bioinformatic analysis of human genome databases resulted in identification of the gene encoding the human  xxxg1081xxx 
( xxxg1081xxx ) based on its sequence homology to the  xxxg1080xxx  gene
(37%) (oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001;
nguyen et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001). although the  xxxg1080xxx  is
mainly present in the nervous system, the  xxxg1081xxx  is distributed mainly in hematopoietic cells (oda et al., 2000; liu et
al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001). the  xxxg1081xxx 
shows a different pharmacological profile compared with the
closely related  xxxg1080xxx , although many  xxxg1080xxx  ligands also interact

4-methylhistamine is a potent and selective histamine  xxxg1081xxx  agonist

with the  xxxg1081xxx . like the  xxxg1080xxx , the  xxxg1081xxx  couples to pertussis
toxin-sensitive gi/o proteins and thereby inhibits forskolininduced camp production (oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a;
zhu et al., 2001). in addition, the  xxxg1081xxx  also activates mitogenactivated protein kinase (morse et al., 2001) and mobilizes
calcium in eosinophils and mast cells (buckland et al., 2003;
hofstra et al., 2003).
the presence of the  xxxg1081xxx  on leukocytes and mast cells
suggests that this new histamine receptor plays an important role in the modulation of the immune system. this
hypothesis is supported by the fact that il-10 and il-13
modulate  xxxg1081xxx  expression (morse et al., 2001) and that
binding sites for cytokine-regulated transcription factors,
such as interferon-stimulated response element, interferon
regulatory factor-1, nuclear factor-␬b, and nuclear factoril6, are present upstream of the  xxxg1081xxx  gene (cogé et al.,
2002). physiological roles of the  xxxg1081xxx  include the control of
il-16 release by human cd8⫹ t cells (gantner et al., 2002),
chemotactic responses and cytoskeletal changes of human
eosinophils (o’reilly et al., 2002; buckland et al., 2003; ling
et al., 2004), chemotaxis and intracellular calcium mobilization in mast cells (hofstra et al., 2003), and control of leukotriene b4 production by mast cells that subsequently leads to
neutrophil recruitment into peritoneum (takeshita et al.,
2003; thurmond et al., 2004). these studies suggest that the
 xxxg1081xxx  is a potential drug target for immune system-related
diseases.
until recently, potent and selective  xxxg1081xxx  ligands were not
available. in the early studies, the  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist thioperamide was identified as an equally effective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist
(oda et al., 2000; hough, 2001). high-throughput screening
and subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts recently identified the indolylpiperazine jnj 7777120 (jablonowski et al.,
2003; thurmond et al., 2004) and the related benzimidazole
analog vuf 6002 (terzioglu et al., 2004) as selective and
potent  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists. studies directed toward selective
 xxxg1081xxx  agonists have so far been less successful. burimamide,
clozapine, and clobenpropit are all known to act as  xxxg1081xxx 
agonists, and clozapine and clobenpropit have been proven
useful for initial pharmacological studies (gantner et al.,
2002; buckland et al., 2003; bell et al., 2004; ling et al.,
2004). currently, the most selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonist is the imifuramine analog oup-16, which displays a 15-fold selectivity
for the  xxxg1081xxx  compared with its binding affinity for the  xxxg1080xxx 
(hashimoto et al., 2003). however, the lack of selectivity of
currently known agonists for the  xxxg1081xxx  limits their use as  xxxg1081xxx 
agonists.
in our search for selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonists, many known
histaminergic ligands of different structural classes, including several important therapeutics, were evaluated for their
interaction with the  xxxg1081xxx . our studies resulted in the identification of 4-methylhistamine, a presumed moderately active and selective  xxxg1079xxx  agonist (durant et al., 1975), as a
high-affinity  xxxg1081xxx  agonist with a more than 100-fold selectivity over the  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx , and  xxxg1080xxx .

cell culture. sk-n-mc cell lines, which stably express either the
human  xxxg1080xxx  (sk-n-mc/hh3) or  xxxg1081xxx  (sk-n-mc/hh4) as well as a
camp-responsive element (cre)-driven ␤-galactosidase reporter
gene sk-n-mc/hh3 or sk-n-mc/hh4 cells (lovenberg et al., 1999;
liu et al., 2001a), were cultured in eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 600 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  at 37°c in 5% co2 and
95% humidity.
radioligand binding assays. the sk-n-mc/hh3 cell homogenates were incubated for 40 min at 25°c with approximately 1 nm
[3h]n␣-methylhistamine in 25 mm kpo4 buffer and 140 mm nacl
(ph 7.4 at 25°c), with or without competing ligands, whereas the
sk-n-mc/hh4 cell homogenates were incubated 1 h at 37°c in 10 nm
[3h]histamine and 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4 at 37°c), with or without
competing ligands. bound radioligands were collected on 0.3% polyethyleneimine-pretreated whatman gf/c [and washed three times
with 3 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (4°c) containing 25 mm tris-hcl
and 140 mm nacl (ph 7.4 at 4°c) for the  xxxg1080xxx  and 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.4 at 4°c) for the  xxxg1081xxx ]. binding analysis of 10 nm [3h]jnj
7777120 and 0.1 nm [125i]iodophenpropit to the  xxxg1081xxx  was performed
with the same conditions as described for [3h]histamine. in satura-

tion binding analysis, the nonspecific binding of [3h]histamine or
[3h]jnj 7777120 was determined with 1 ␮m clobenpropit. the binding analysis of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  and [125i]iodoaminopotentidine
binding to human  xxxg1078xxx  and human  xxxg1079xxx , respectively, was performed
according to bakker et al. (2004). the binding data were analyzed
with prism 4.0 (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca), and data
are presented as mean ⫾ s.e.m. mouse and rat  xxxg1081xxx  radioligand
binding assays were performed according to liu et al. (2001b).
colometric  xxxd1773xxx  assay. a reporter cre-␤-galactosidase
reporter gene assay was used to determine (inverse) agonistic or
antagonistic activity of either the  xxxg1080xxx  or  xxxg1081xxx . approximately 4
million cells/96-well plate of sk-n-mc/hh3 and sk-n-mc/hh4 cells
were exposed for 6 h to histaminergic ligands in serum-free eagle’s
minimum essential medium containing 1 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx . thereafter,
the medium was discarded, the cells were lysed in 100 ␮l of assay
buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer at ph 8.0, 4 mm 2-nitrophenol-␤-d-pyranoside, 0.5% triton x-100, 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.1 mm
mncl2, and 40 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx ), incubated overnight at room
temperature, and the ␤-galactosidase activity was determined at 420
nm with a powerwavex340 plate reader (bio-tek instruments inc.,
winooski, vt). the od420 might differ between experiments due to
intra-assay variability; therefore, intrinsic activity of agonists was
determined relatively to activity of histamine.

primary cell experiments. cell culture of balb/c mice-derived
bone marrow mast cells (bmmcs) and in vitro bmmc chemotaxis
assay was performed as described previously (hofstra et al., 2003).
purification of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the human
eosinophil shape change assay were performed as described previously (ling et al., 2004). the mouse-derived bmmcs were obtained
following approved protocols that follow national institutes of
health/international animal care and use guidelines.

results
pharmacological characterization of the  xxxg1081xxx  expressed in sk-n-mc cells. stable transfection of the  xxxg1081xxx 
cdna in sk-n-mc cells resulted in the expression of functional  xxxg1081xxx  proteins. the  xxxg1081xxx  could be labeled with both
agonist and antagonist radioligands. the  xxxg1081xxx  agonist
[3h]histamine shows saturable binding to the expressed  xxxg1081xxx 
with a minimal amount of nonspecific binding (fig. 1a).
analysis of the [3h]histamine saturation binding yielded a
kd value of 11 ⫾ 1.0 nm (n ⫽ 6) and a bmax value of 1.8 ⫾ 0.4
pmol/mg protein. recently, jnj 7777120 was described as a
selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist (jablonowski et al., 2003). in our

fig. 1. the cell line sk-n-mc/hh4 stably expresses functional  xxxg1081xxx  and cre-control ␤-galactosidase. the homogenate of sk-n-mc/hh4 cells shows
a saturable binding for the  xxxg1081xxx  agonist [3h]histamine (a) and also for the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist [3h]jnj 7777120 (b). the binding of [3h]histamine to the
 xxxg1081xxx  is inhibited by h3/4r ligands (c). the full agonist histamine and partial agonist clobenpropit  xxxg1081xxx  inhibit the 1 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx -induced cre
activation, as measured by a ␤-galactosidase reporter gene, whereas the  xxxd1422xxx  thioperamide dose-dependently blocks the  xxxg1081xxx  constitutive
activity (d). data shown are from representative experiments, each performed in triplicate.

4-methylhistamine is a potent and selective histamine  xxxg1081xxx  agonist

hands, the nonimidazole jnj 7777120 shows  xxxd3426xxx -fold selectivity for the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 7.8 ⫾ 0.1 against [3h]histamine)
over the  xxxg1080xxx  (pki ⫽ 5.3 ⫾ 0.1 against [3h]n␣-methylhistamine), allowing the use of [3h]jnj 7777120 to label the  xxxg1081xxx 
(thurmond et al., 2004). the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist [3h]jnj
7777120 exhibits a somewhat higher level of nonspecific
binding to  xxxg1081xxx  expressing sk-n-mc cells, but it also binds
saturably and shows an equipotent affinity (kd ⫽ 11 ⫾ 3.6
nm; n ⫽ 3) and results in a bmax value of 1.7 ⫾ 0.4 pmol/mg
protein (fig. 1b). the binding of either 10 nm [3h]histamine
(fig. 1c) or 10 nm [3h]jnj 7777120 (data not shown) to the
 xxxg1081xxx  is fully displaced by histamine (pki ⫽ 7.8 ⫾ 0.1), the
h3/4r antagonist thioperamide (pki ⫽ 6.9 ⫾ 0.1) and the  xxxg1081xxx 
agonist/ xxxg1080xxx  antagonist clobenpropit (pki ⫽ 8.1 ⫾ 0.1), in a
good agreement with the results reported previously (oda et
al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001).
the sk-n-mc/hh4 cells used in this study coexpress a
cre-controlled ␤-galactosidase reporter gene and can therefore also be used for a functional analysis of  xxxg1081xxx  ligands.
stimulation of the  xxxg1081xxx  with histamine resulted in the inhibition (58 ⫾ 3%; n ⫽ 16) of the  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated (1 ␮m)
camp-mediated reporter gene transcription with a pec50
value of 7.7 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 16) (fig. 1d). treatment of sk-n-mc/
hh4 cells with the g␣i/o protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (100
ng/ml for 16 h) completely inhibited histamine induced responses, confirming the coupling of the  xxxg1081xxx  to g␣i/o proteins
(oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; zhu et al., 2001). in our
hands, histamine exerted the maximally observed level of
inhibition in this assay and is therefore referred to as a full
agonist (intrinsic activity ␣ ⫽ 1). as reported previously (oda
et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001), clobenpropit
acts as a potent partial  xxxg1081xxx  agonist with a pec50 value of
7.7 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 3) and an intrinsic activity of 0.8 (fig. 1d).
treatment of sk-n-mc/hh4 cells with pertussis toxin (100
ng/ml for 16 h) resulted in an increase of 1 ␮m forskolinstimulated cre activity by 130 ⫾ 3%, suggesting that the
 xxxg1081xxx  shows a detectable level of constitutive activity in the
sk-n-mc/hh4 cells. in line with previous observations on
inverse agonism by thioperamide (liu et al., 2001a; morse et
al., 2001), 1 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cre activity was increased by thioperamide with a pec50 value of 7.0 ⫾ 0.1 (fig.
1d). the inhibition of the constitutive activity of the  xxxg1081xxx  by
thioperamide was of the same magnitude as observed after
treatment with pertussis toxin and thioperamide is referred
to as a full inverse  xxxg1081xxx  agonist (intrinsic activity ␣ ⫽ ⫺1).
in sk-n-mc/hh4 cells the camp-driven ␤-galactosidase
reporter-gene transcription also can be activated by endogenously expressed g␣s protein-coupled ␤ adrenergic receptors (bahouth et al., 2001). the ␤2 adrenergic receptor agonist feneterol induced ␤-galactosidase activity to a similar
extent to that of  xxxd1742xxx , with a pec50 value of 6.9 ⫾ 0.1
(n ⫽ 6).  xxxg1081xxx  activation by histamine inhibited the 100 nm
feneterol-induced ␤-galactosidase activity for 39 ⫾ 3% with a
pec50 value of 7.4 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 7). however, inverse agonistic
activity of thioperamide, at the  xxxg1081xxx , could not be easily
demonstrated with a feneterol-based assay system (data not
shown). the evaluation of the functional activity of all the
various histaminergic ligands was therefore performed using
 xxxd1742xxx  (1 ␮m) stimulated sk-n-mc/hh4 cells.
all compounds were preliminarily tested as displacers of
[3h]histamine binding to the  xxxg1081xxx  expressed in sk-n-mc/
hh4 cells at a concentration of 10 ␮m. compounds inhibiting

the specific binding of 10 nm [3h]histamine to the  xxxg1081xxx  by
ⱕ30% are expected to have a ki ⬎ 10 ␮m based on the cheng
and prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff, 1973): ki ⫽ ic50/(1
⫹ [radioligand]/kd) and were excluded for further testing.
active compounds (displacement ⱖ30%) were tested more
extensively in both [3h]histamine displacement studies and
the cre-␤-galactosidase-based functional  xxxg1081xxx  assay.
most  xxxg1078xxx  ligands are devoid of  xxxg1081xxx  activity. histamine potently displaces [3h]histamine from the  xxxg1081xxx  with a
pki value of 7.8 ⫾ 0.1 (table 1), whereas  xxxg1078xxx  agonists with
substituents at the 2-position of the imidazole ring show
significantly lower affinities. substitution of the imidazole
ring with either a small methyl or large 3-bromophenyl substituent is not tolerated and causes an almost 100-fold drop
of affinity. bulkier substituents at the 2-position (1,1-diphenylpropyl in histaprodifen) even result in a total loss of
affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 1). agonists, lacking the imidazole ring, such as tea, pea, or 8r- xxxd2498xxx  (bakker et al.,
2004), are also not active at the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 1).
after an initial report that the  xxxg1081xxx  can be labeled with
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  (nguyen et al., 2001), a large number of
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists (table 1), including many clinically relevant
drugs, were evaluated for their  xxxg1081xxx  affinity as well. almost
all tested  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, including  xxxd3050xxx , showed
pki values ⬍5 (table 1) and did not show functional activity
at 1 and 10 ␮m at the  xxxg1081xxx  (data not shown). although
structurally similar to some tricyclic  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists devoid
of  xxxg1081xxx  affinity, clozapine binds with moderate potency to the
 xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 6.7 ⫾ 0.1) and exerts full agonistic activity at
the  xxxg1081xxx  with a pec50 value of 6.8 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 5). ndesmethyl clozapine, a clozapine metabolite, showed a
slightly decreased affinity (pki ⫽ 6.5 ⫾ 0.1), whereas n-oxide
clozapine, another clozapine metabolite, is totally devoid of
 xxxg1081xxx  affinity. furthermore, we evaluated clozapine analogs
of therapeutic importance as well.  xxxd2511xxx  and  xxxd160xxx 
showed ⬎10-fold lower affinity (pki 5.4 ⫾ 0.1 and 5.3 ⫾ 0.1,
respectively), whereas octoclothepin did not show binding for
the  xxxg1081xxx  at all.
some  xxxg1079xxx  ligands act as  xxxg1081xxx  agonists. within the
series of known  xxxg1079xxx  agonists that we have tested, only some
ligands retain  xxxg1081xxx  activity. replacement of the imidazole
ring of histamine in the selective  xxxg1079xxx  agonists amthamine
and amselamine (leurs et al., 1994) results in a total loss of
 xxxg1081xxx  activity at concentrations up to 10 ␮m. dimaprit, a
 xxxg1079xxx  agonist/ xxxg1080xxx  antagonist lacking an imidazole group,
binds the  xxxg1081xxx  with moderate affinity, showing a pki value of
6.5 ⫾ 0.1, and exerts partial  xxxg1081xxx  agonistic activity (table 1).
impromidine, which was reported to bind to both  xxxg1079xxx  and
 xxxg1080xxx , also binds potently to the  xxxg1081xxx  with a pki value of
7.6 ⫾ 0.1 and acts as a partial  xxxg1081xxx  agonist (␣ ⫽ 0.5). both the
r- and s-enantiomers of the related sopromidine bind, respectively, ⬎10 and ⬎100 times less potently. in fact, the
first reported  xxxg1079xxx  selective agonist 4-methylhistamine (durant et al., 1975) is the only known  xxxg1079xxx  agonist that also acts
as full agonist at the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 1). 4-methylhistamine binds
two times less potently than histamine to the  xxxg1081xxx , exhibiting a pki value of 7.3 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 3).
most tested  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists, including cimetidine, mifentidine, aminopotentidine, ranitidine,  xxxd2082xxx , and tiotidine, only displaced ⬍30% of 10 nm [3h]histamine binding to
the  xxxg1081xxx . only the h2/3r ligand burimamide shows a high

burimamide acted as a potent, albeit partial  xxxg1081xxx  agonist
(pec50 ⫽ 7.7 ⫾ 0.1; ␣ ⫽ 0.7). previously, we reported on
various burimamide analogs as  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists (vollinga et
al., 1995). in our search for  xxxg1081xxx  selective ligands, various
burimamide analogs were therefore investigated for their
 xxxg1081xxx  activity. in this series of compounds, the presence of an
isopropyl (vuf 4683 and vuf 4616) or cyclohexyl (vuf
4617) moiety adjacent to the thiourea group improved the
affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 2). interestingly, this series of
closely related compounds exerts partial agonistic, neutral
antagonistic, and inverse agonistic activities at the  xxxg1081xxx 
(table 2; fig. 2a). substitution on the thiourea with aromatic
substituents, like a benzyl group in vuf 4686, results in a
reduced  xxxg1081xxx  agonistic activity. a total loss of agonistic  xxxg1081xxx 
activity, but not affinity (pki ⫽ 7.6 ⫾ 0.1) is surprisingly
observed for vuf 4614. as can be seen in fig. 2b, vuf 4614
was able to competitively block the  xxxg1081xxx  agonistic responses

of histamine, resulting in a pa2 value of 6.8. finally, within
this series we identified vuf 4742 as an  xxxg1081xxx   xxxd1422xxx  (fig. 2a). this burimamide analog bound with moderate
affinity to the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 6.9 ⫾ 0.1; n ⫽ 4) and acted as a full
 xxxd1422xxx  with a pec50 value of 7.2 ⫾ 0.1 (n ⫽ 5), in
accordance with its binding affinity.
evaluation of  xxxg1080xxx  ligands at the  xxxg1081xxx . the  xxxg1081xxx 
shares its highest sequence homology with the  xxxg1080xxx , and it is
therefore not surprising that in the initial studies some  xxxg1080xxx 
ligands were identified as  xxxg1081xxx  ligands as well. we therefore
characterized in this study a large set of known  xxxg1080xxx  ligands
for their interaction with the  xxxg1081xxx . the histamine analogs
n␣-methylhistamine, (r)-␣-methylhistamine, and (s)-␣methylhistamine show an almost 2 order of magnitude lower
affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  than for the  xxxg1080xxx . however, the  xxxg1081xxx 
retains some level of stereoselectivity for (r)-␣- (pki ⫽ 6.6 ⫾
0.1) and (s)-␣-methylhistamine (pki ⫽ 5.4 ⫾ 0.1) (table 3).

compounds that exerted a biphasic response: a slight decrease of  xxxd1742xxx  stimulated ␤-galactosidase activity at concentrations up to 1 ␮m and an increase at
concentrations ⱖ10 ␮m. the latter effect is not mediated by the  xxxg1081xxx , because it cannot be blocked by  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj 7777120.

fig. 2. burimamide analogs exert different intrinsic activities at the  xxxg1081xxx . a, burimamide acts as a  xxxg1081xxx  partial agonist, which dose-dependently
inhibits 1 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx -induced cre activation in sk-n-mc/hh4 cells. various burimamide analogs act as  xxxg1081xxx  agonists (vuf 4683, burimamide, and
vuf 4686), a neutral  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist (vuf 4614), or an inverse  xxxg1081xxx  agonist (vuf 4742). b, neutral  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist vuf 4614 competitively
antagonizes the histamine response at the  xxxg1081xxx , resulting in a rightward shift of histamine dose-response curve. data shown are from representative
experiments, each performed in triplicate.

increasing the spacer length between imidazole and amine
group from two carbon atoms (histamine, pki ⫽ 7.8 ⫾ 0.1) to
three carbon atoms (homohistamine, pki ⫽ 7.5 ⫾ 0.1) slightly
decreases the affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx , whereas four carbon
atoms (imbutamine, pki ⫽ 8.0 ⫾ 0.1) results in a slightly
higher  xxxg1081xxx  affinity. a further increase of the spacer length
proved to be detrimental for  xxxg1081xxx  affinity. the highly potent
 xxxg1080xxx  agonist impentamine shows only moderate affinity at
the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 6.6 ⫾ 0.1) (table 3). interestingly, besides the
affinity, impentamine also looses intrinsic activity for the
 xxxg1081xxx  (␣ ⫽ 0). previously identified  xxxg1080xxx  agonists, including
immepip, imetit, and vuf 8328 (an imetit analog) (wieland
et al., 2001), also potently bind the  xxxg1081xxx  with pki values of
7.7 ⫾ 0.1, 8.2 ⫾ 0.1, and 8.0 ⫾ 0.1, respectively. at the  xxxg1081xxx 
these ligands also act as agonists, but exert somewhat lower

intrinsic activity (␣ values of 0.9, 0.9, and 0.6, respectively)
(table 3). as reported previously (kitbunnadaj et al., 2004),
the recently identified  xxxg1080xxx  agonist immethridine (pki ⫽
9.1 ⫾ 0.1) binds much less potently to the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 6.6 ⫾
0.1) and is also not able to fully activate the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 3). in
agreement with our findings with n␣-methylhistamine, the
methylated immepip analog methimepip shows a large selectivity for the  xxxg1080xxx  (pki ⫽ 9.0 ⫾ 0.1) over the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽
5.7 ⫾ 0.1), as reported previously (kitbunnadaj et al., 2005).
also various  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists bind to the  xxxg1081xxx  (oda et al.,
2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001).
in our hands the isothiourea-based  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists clobenpropit and iodophenpropit both potently bind to the  xxxg1081xxx 
(table 3). yet, both ligands have very distinguishable intrinsic activities at the  xxxg1081xxx . clobenpropit, which acts as inverse

␣, intrinsic activity (1 designated for full agonistic, 0 for neutral antagonist, and ⫺1 for full inverse agonistic activity).

agonist at the  xxxg1080xxx  (wieland et al., 2001) behaves as a
potent partial agonist at the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 3; fig. 3, a and b).
in contrast, iodophenpropit, which also acts as an inverse
agonist at the  xxxg1080xxx  (wieland et al., 2001), behaves as a
neutral antagonist at the  xxxg1081xxx  with a pki value of 7.9 ⫾ 0.1
(n ⫽ 6) (table 3; fig. 3, a and b). as expected, iodophenpropit
competitively antagonized the action of histamine at the
 xxxg1081xxx , yielding a linear schild-plot and a pa2 value of 8.0
(fig. 3, c and d), in accordance with its binding affinity.
besides clobenpropit, also the known  xxxg1080xxx  ligands proxyfan
and the related iodoproxyfan show reasonable  xxxg1081xxx  affinity
with pki values of 7.3 ⫾ 0.1 and 7.9 ⫾ 0.1, respectively. as
observed for their action at the  xxxg1080xxx , both compounds act as
partial agonist at the  xxxg1081xxx  (table 3).
evaluation of the potential use of [125i]iodophenpropit as  xxxg1081xxx  radioligand. as reported in the previous
section and in other studies, the  xxxg1081xxx  can be labeled with
either [3h]histamine or the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist [3h]jnj 7777120
(oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001; nguyen
et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001; thurmond et al., 2004). previously, we described [125i]iodophenproprit as a suitable high
affinity  xxxg1080xxx  radioligand (jansen et al., 1992). considering,
the relatively high affinity of iodophenpropit at the  xxxg1081xxx  and
its high sensitivity, we investigated the potential of this
radioligand to label the  xxxg1081xxx . due to the  xxxg1081xxx  affinity of
[125i]iodophenpropit, saturation binding experiments were
not feasible. we therefore used homologous [125i]iodophenpropit displacement analysis to determine a kd value of
34.4 ⫾ 4.1 nm for [125i]iodophenpropit. the bmax value obtained using [125i]iodophenpropit-binding displacement experiments (3.8 ⫾ 0.4 pmol/mg protein) is approximately 2
times higher than those obtained with either [3h]histamine
(1.8 ⫾ 0.4 pmol/mg protein) and [3h]jnj 7777120 (1.7 ⫾ 0.4
pmol/mg protein). [125i]iodophenpropit binding to membranes of sk-n-mc/hh4 cells was competitively displaced by
a variety of h3/4r ligands (fig. 4), despite a high level of
nonspecific binding of approximately 60% as determined

with 10 ␮m imetit. however, iodophenpropit and the related
clobenpropit also displaced the nonspecific binding, resulting
in a multiple site binding profile. the pki values of compounds for the  xxxg1081xxx  obtained using [125i]iodophenpropit displacement studies are consistent with their corresponding
values obtained using displacement of either [3h]histamine
or [3h]jnj 7777120 binding to the  xxxg1081xxx ; only the pki value
of thioperamide obtained using [125i]iodophenpropit displacement studies seems to deviate somewhat form the pki
values obtained using either [3h]histamine or [3h]jnj
7777120 displacement studies (fig. 4; table 4).
4-methylhistamine as a selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonist. after
our initial observation of the relative high affinity of 4-methylhistamine for the  xxxg1081xxx , this histamine analog was evaluated in more detail. 4-methylhistamine not only has high
affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  (pki ⫽ 7.3 ⫾ 0.1; n ⫽ 3) but also exhibits
considerable selectivity for the  xxxg1081xxx  over the other three
human histamine receptors (fig. 5a). the human histamine
h1, h2, and h3 receptors were tested for their interaction
with 4-methylhistamine, using respectively 1 nm [3h] xxxd3050xxx  (kd ⫽ 1.6 nm), 0.5 nm [125i]iodoaminopotentidine
(kd ⫽ 0.5 nm) and 1 nm [3h]n␣-methylhistamine (kd ⫽ 2.9
nm) binding to homogenates of transfected cells. as can be
seen in fig. 5a, 4-methylhistamine shows highest affinity for
the  xxxg1081xxx  and binds considerably less potently to the other
histamine receptors, resulting in a ⬎100-fold and ⬎100,000fold selectivity over the  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1079xxx , and  xxxg1078xxx , respectively.
4-methylhistamine not only binds to the  xxxg1081xxx  but also has a
high affinity, albeit reduced compared with the  xxxg1081xxx , for the
mouse and rat  xxxg1081xxx  with ki values of 73 and 55 nm, respectively (fig. 5b). moreover, 4-methylhistamine exerts full agonistic activity at the  xxxg1081xxx  (fig. 5c), resulting in a pec50
value of 7.4 ⫾ 0.1 (␣ ⫽ 1; n ⫽ 5). in contrast, 4-methylhistamine exhibits only moderate affinity for the  xxxg1079xxx  (pki ⫽
5.1 ⫾ 0.1; n ⫽ 3) and  xxxg1080xxx  (pki ⫽ 5.2 ⫾ 0.1; n ⫽ 4), and
partial agonistic  xxxg1080xxx  activity (fig. 5d). the  xxxg1081xxx  agonistic
effects of 4-methylhistamine can be antagonized by the se-

duced ␤-galactosidase activity yields a pa2 value of 7.8 (data
not shown), which is in agreement with the  xxxg1081xxx  affinity of
jnj 7777120 (table 3) (jablonowski et al., 2003; thurmond
et al., 2004). at the mouse and rat  xxxg1081xxx , 4-methylhistamine
also acts as a full h4 agonist, although with reduced pec50
values of 5.8 ⫾ 0.1 and 5.6 ⫾ 0.1, respectively.
previously, the  xxxg1081xxx  has been shown to be involved in the
regulation of eosinophil and mast cell function (o’reilly et
al., 2002; buckland et al., 2003; hofstra et al., 2003;
takeshita et al., 2003; ling et al., 2004; thurmond et al.,
2004). indeed, 4-methylhistamine also acted as  xxxg1081xxx  agonist
at human eosinophils and induced a rapid change in eosinophil cell shape, as measured by the gated autofluorescence
forward scatter assay (ling et al., 2004). the  xxxg1081xxx  agonist
4-methylhistamine acted as a full agonist and dose-dependently induced a change in forward scatter (fig. 6a) with an
ec50 value of 0.36 ⫾ 0.09 ␮m, which was 3-fold less active
compared with histamine. the effects of 4-methylhistamine
on human eosinophils were not inhibited by  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx  or  xxxg1079xxx  antagonist ranitidine, but they could be
antagonized by the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj 7777120 (fig. 6b).
 xxxg1080xxx  antagonists were not included in this assay because

e, 4-methylhistamine exerts a full  xxxg1081xxx  agonistic activity that is competitively antagonized by jnj 7777120. data shown are from representative
experiments, each performed in triplicate.

ling et al. (2004) have previously demonstrated that the  xxxg1080xxx 
antagonist jnj 637940 did not affect histamine-induced eosinophil shape change and that the  xxxg1080xxx  was not expressed in
eosinophils. finally, 4-methylhistamine was tested as an
 xxxg1081xxx  agonist at mouse bmmcs as described previously (hofstra et al., 2003). like histamine, 4-methylhistamine dosedependently induced migration of murine bmmcs with an
ec50 value of 12 ␮m (fig. 6c), again a somewhat lower
potency compared with histamine (hofstra et al., 2003). furthermore, we found that the effect of 4-methylhistamine
on murine bmmcs was completely inhibited by the selective
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj 7777120 in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 6d).

discussion
with the addition of the  xxxg1081xxx  to the histamine receptor
family (oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001;
nguyen et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001), this potential new drug
target has created a lot of excitement in the field. the predominant expression of the histamine  xxxg1081xxx  on hematopoietic
cells (oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001;
zhu et al., 2001) and the  xxxg1081xxx  effects on, e.g., eosinophil and
mast cell functions (gantner et al., 2002; o’reilly et al., 2002;
buckland et al., 2003; hofstra et al., 2003; takeshita et al.,
2003; ling et al., 2004; thurmond et al., 2004) imply that this
new histamine receptor subtype may play a role in various

allergic and inflammatory conditions. so far, the search for
selective  xxxg1081xxx  ligands has resulted in the discovery of potent
neutral  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists as jnj 7777120 (jablonowski et
al., 2003; thurmond et al., 2004) and vuf 6002 (terzioglu et
al., 2004), whereas potent and selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonists or
inverse agonists have so far not been described. in search for
new  xxxg1081xxx  ligands, we therefore screened a library of known
histaminergic ligands, using sk-n-mc cells stably expressing the  xxxg1081xxx . in this cell line the  xxxg1081xxx  binds [3h]histamine
and [3h]jnj 7777120 with high affinity (fig. 1, a and b) and
functionally inhibits  xxxd1742xxx -induced cre-mediated responses through pertussis toxin-sensitive gi/o proteins (fig.
1d). in these cells the  xxxg1081xxx  also exhibits constitutive activity, which is blocked by pertussis toxin or the nonselective
 xxxd1422xxx  thioperamide (fig. 1d).
considering the  xxxg1081xxx  shares its highest sequence similarity
with the  xxxg1080xxx , it is not surprising that the  xxxg1081xxx  is targeted by
various imidazole containing  xxxg1080xxx  ligands (oda et al., 2000;
liu et al., 2001a; morse et al., 2001; zhu et al., 2001). the
standard  xxxg1080xxx   xxxd1422xxx  thioperamide (arrang et al.,
1983) also acts as an  xxxd1422xxx  at the  xxxg1081xxx . moreover,
in the present study we confirm that the presumed  xxxg1080xxx 

agonists immepip, imetit, (r)-␣-methylhistamine, and imbutamine also act as potent  xxxg1081xxx  agonists. furthermore, the
 xxxg1081xxx  is activated by the  xxxg1079xxx / xxxg1080xxx  antagonist burimamide, the
 xxxg1080xxx  antagonists clobenpropit, and the  xxxg1080xxx  agonist iodoproxyfan, indicating that for  xxxg1081xxx  agonism considerable
structural diversity (piperidine, isothiourea, thiourea, and
ether) in the side chain of imidazole ring is allowed, including
aromatic substitutions as indicated by the  xxxg1081xxx  agonism
displayed by clobenpropit. however, our detailed analysis of
various  xxxg1080xxx  ligands indicates that  xxxg1081xxx  efficacy can be
modulated by differential hydrophobic substitution on the
side chain. in the burimamide series we observed that differential substitution on the thiourea group gives rise to  xxxg1081xxx 
(partial) agonists, a neutral antagonist (vuf 4614; pki ⫽ 7.6)
and a full  xxxd1422xxx  (vuf 4742; pki ⫽ 6.9). in addition,
in the clobenpropit series, we observe that a slight change on
the isothiourea substituent results in a modulation of  xxxg1081xxx 
efficacy. the clobenpropit analog iodophenpropit (a phenylethyl substituent instead of a benzyl group) retains high  xxxg1081xxx 
affinity (pki ⫽ 7.9), but it has lost agonistic activity completely. in this study, we identified iodophenpropit as a highaffinity, neutral antagonist for the  xxxg1081xxx . in view of the ⬃15

1320

lim et al.

nm affinity of iodophenpropit for the  xxxg1081xxx , we evaluated
[125i]iodophenpropit as a potential new  xxxg1081xxx  radioligand. the
 xxxg1081xxx  can be labeled to the same extent with both the agonist
[3h]histamine and the neutral antagonist [3h]jnj 7777120.
surprisingly, the bmax value determined with [125i]iodophenpropit was twice as much as that determined with either
[3h]histamine or [3h]jnj 7777120, suggesting that the radioligands might bind to different  xxxg1081xxx  subpopulations, similarly to recent findings on the binding of two  xxxg1078xxx  radioligands to the  xxxg1078xxx  (booth et al., 2002). yet, the potential
existence of different  xxxg1081xxx  subpopulations needs further investigation. the binding of the three radioligands to membranes of sk-n-mc/hh4 cells was displaced by a variety of
h3/4r ligands, and the pki values obtained from these displacement studies show a high correlation. despite being
shown as a potential  xxxg1081xxx  radioligand, [125i]iodophenpropit
has to be used with caution, as in our hands a high level of
nonspecific binding limits its use.
from our screening of many  xxxg1078xxx  ligands, only the tricyclic
clozapine shows reasonable  xxxg1081xxx  affinity, as reported previously (oda et al., 2000; liu et al., 2001a; zhu et al., 2001).
despite their structural similarity to clozapine, other tested
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists do not show any appreciable affinity for the
 xxxg1081xxx . we can therefore not confirm that  xxxd3050xxx  binds
to the  xxxg1081xxx  (nguyen et al., 2001), either studied by displacement of [3h]histamine binding to the  xxxg1081xxx , by saturation
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding assays (data not shown), or by functional  xxxg1081xxx  assays. clinically used  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, such as
cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, and  xxxd2504xxx , demonstrate significant in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, which
are not related to their  xxxg1078xxx  activity (gelfand et al., 2004).
the data from our study do not support the involvement of
the  xxxg1081xxx  in the anti-inflammatory effects of these  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists.
an important finding of this study is the discovery of
4-methylhistamine as a potent and selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonist in
both recombinant and endogenously expressing  xxxg1081xxx  systems. whereas this compound is originally described as a
relatively selective  xxxg1079xxx  agonist (durant et al., 1975), our
present data show that this histamine analog exhibits more
than 100-fold selectivity over the recombinant  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx , and
h3rs. 4-methylhistamine not only acts as a full agonist at
the recombinant  xxxg1081xxx  but also induces migration of mouse
bone marrow derived mast cells and a shape change of human eosinophils. both processes have recently been shown to
be induced by histamine via interaction of the  xxxg1081xxx  (hofstra
et al., 2003; ling et al., 2004). the relative potencies of
histamine and 4-methylhistamine on human eosinophils are
similar to those observed in recombinant systems. similar to
the observations with histamine (hofstra et al., 2003; ling et
al., 2004), the potency of 4-methylhistamine on mouse mast
cells is somewhat lower than in recombinant systems. although the mouse  xxxg1081xxx  shows a lower affinity for both histamine and 4-methylhistamine compared with the  xxxg1081xxx , the
low potency at bmmcs seems not merely an issue of species
difference, but also it might be related to a low  xxxg1081xxx  expression level. in fact, the  xxxg1081xxx  in bmmcs is present at a very low
density because it cannot be detected by radioligand binding
studies (r. l. thurmond, unpublished observations). moreover, the cellular environment might dictate the potency of
an agonist, such as composition of g proteins and accessories
proteins in the cells (kenakin, 2004).

in conclusion, from a large screening of many known histamine receptor ligands we have identified a variety of compounds with interesting  xxxg1081xxx  activities. the major significance of these findings is the reevaluation of numerous
histaminergic ligands at the new histamine receptor subtypes. based upon our data, many imidazol-containing  xxxg1080xxx 
ligands, including various  xxxg1080xxx  reference compounds, show
potent  xxxg1081xxx  activities and should be treated with caution.
more recently developed  xxxg1080xxx  agonists, such as immethridine
(kitbunnadaj et al., 2004) or methimmepip (kitbunnadaj et
al., 2005), or nonimidazole  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists, such as jnj
6379490 (ling et al., 2004) or a-349821 (esbenshade et al.,
2004), hardly act at the  xxxg1081xxx  and will therefore provide good
tools to selectively target the  xxxg1080xxx . in the series of tested  xxxg1080xxx 
ligands, we have identified iodophenpropit as potent neutral
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonist and the burimamide analog vuf 4742 as the
second identified  xxxg1081xxx   xxxd1422xxx . from the screening of
 xxxg1079xxx  ligands, we have identified 4-methylhistamine as the
first high-affinity  xxxg1081xxx  agonist (ki ⫽ 50 nm) that has a
⬎100-fold selectivity for the  xxxg1081xxx  over the other histamine
receptor subtypes. the identification of 4-methylhistamine
as a potent  xxxg1081xxx  agonist will be of major importance for future
studies to unravel the physiological roles of the  xxxg1081xxx .
