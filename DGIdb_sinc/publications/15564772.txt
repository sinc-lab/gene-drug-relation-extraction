abstract
background: the human histamine  xxxg1078xxx  is constitutively active and exhibits basal activation of nuclear
factor-îb (nf-îb), an important modulator of allergic
inflammation. certain h1 antihistamines have recently
been shown to inhibit basal nf-îb activity by stabilizing
the  xxxg1078xxx  in an inactive state, a phenomenon called
‘inverse agonism’. methods: we evaluated the effect of
the new h1 antihistamine,  xxxd1846xxx , on basal and
histamine-stimulated nf-îb activity and compared it
with the activities of other h1 antihistamines. results:
transiently transfected cos-7 cells co-expressing nfîb-luciferase and the  xxxg1078xxx  exhibited constitutive
nf-îb activity. h1 antihistamines reduced basal nf-îb
activity (rank order of potency:  xxxd1846xxx  1  xxxd3050xxx  1 cetirizine 1 loratadine 1 fexofenadine). histamine stimulated basal nf-îb activity 8-fold, which was
blocked by h1 antihistamines (rank order of potency:  xxxd1846xxx  1 cetirizine 1  xxxd3050xxx  1 loratadine 1 fexofenadine). neither histamine nor antihistamines had any
effect on nf-îb activity in the absence of the  xxxg1078xxx .
conclusions:  xxxd1846xxx , acting through the histamine  xxxg1078xxx , inhibited basal nf-îb activity and can

introduction

histamine, acting via h1 receptors, plays a key role in
the induction of early-phase nasal allergic symptoms such
as sneezing, itching and rhinorrhea that occur following
mast cell degranulation [1]. these initial allergic symptoms are caused predominantly by direct stimulation of
neuronal responses and glandular secretion by histamine.
it has become increasingly apparent, however, that histamine also has more complex pro-inflammatory effects [2].
histamine modulates the maturation and migration of
key allergic inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, b and t lymphocytes, and dendritic cells [2]. it
has also been shown to upregulate the release of cytokines,
chemokines and adhesion molecules by inflammatory
cells, epithelium and endothelium [3]. a major component of the inflammatory action of histamine appears to
be its ability to activate, via the  xxxg1078xxx , intracellular
regulators of gene expression, such as nuclear factor-îb
(nf-îb) [4].

histamine receptors belong to the g-protein-coupled
receptor (gpcr) superfamily [5]. recently, it has been
recognized that, like other gpcrs, the h1, h2, h3 and h4
histamine receptor subtypes are constitutively active [6–
9]. thus, in the absence of histamine, the  xxxg1078xxx  activates intracellular targets such as nf-îb at a low level.
histamine stimulates this basal activity, and some h1
antihistaminic compounds have recently been shown to
inhibit this constitutive  xxxg1078xxx  signaling [6], an effect
that is termed ‘inverse agonism’. therefore, the  xxxg1078xxx  can be thought of existing in active and inactive forms,
with the active form being stabilized by the agonist histamine and the inactive form being stabilized by inverse
agonists [4, 5].
 xxxd1846xxx  is a new, selective, non-sedating h1 antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of seasonal [10]
and perennial allergic rhinitis [11] and chronic idiopathic
urticaria [12]. previously, we have shown that  xxxd1846xxx  is a potent antagonist of histamine at the human h1
receptor and is more potent than other commonly used
antihistamines in this regard [13]. the  xxxd1422xxx 
activity of  xxxd1846xxx , however, has not yet been determined. therefore, we studied the effect of  xxxd1846xxx 
and other antihistamines on basal and histamine-stimulated nf-îb activity using a luciferase reporter gene assay.

cells expressing an nf-îb-luciferase reporter gene or co-expressing
the human histamine  xxxg1078xxx  with an nf-îb-luciferase reporter
gene.

all luminescence and concentration data were tabulated as
means b standard error of the means for at least 3 experiments. data
points were acquired in quintuplicate or greater for each experiment.
curves were fitted to the data using a non-linear, least-squares,
curve-fitting program (prism, graphpad software inc., san diego,
calif., usa).

methods
a 10 –2 m aqueous solution of histamine (sigma, st. louis, mo.,
usa) was diluted in cell culture medium to a concentration range of
10 –4 to 10 –9 m.  xxxd1846xxx  and loratadine (schering-plough,
kenilworth, n.j., usa) 10 –2 m stock solutions in dmso were
diluted in cell culture medium to make a concentration range of 10 –5
to 10 –11 m. cetirizine,  xxxd3050xxx  and fexofenadine solutions (schering-plough, kenilworth, n.j., usa) were made in the same manner
and concentration range as  xxxd1846xxx  and loratadine.
immortalized cos-7 african green monkey kidney cells (american type culture collection, manassas, va., usa) were cultured at
37 ° c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium/10% fetal calf serum containing 2 mm glutamine,
1.5% sodium bicarbonate, penicillin 100 u/ml, streptomycin 100 ìg/
ml. cdna for the human histamine  xxxg1078xxx  was cloned into a
pcdna3.1 expression vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, calif., usa).
the pcdna3.1-h1 (0.25 ìg/well) and a nf-îb-luciferase reporter
gene (0.05 ìg/well; stratagene, la jolla, calif., usa) were co-transfected into cos-7 cells using the lipofectamine 2000 protocol (invitrogen).
cells were plated onto black 96-well view plates® (packard, meridien, conn., usa). after 20 h of transfection, the cell culture
medium was replaced with medium containing study drugs and incubated for 24 h. thereafter, cells were lysed using steady-glo®
reagent, and luciferase activity was measured with a top count®
scintillation counter (packard) using the steady-glo luciferase assay system (promega corp., madison, wisc., usa).

results

in cos-7 cells co-expressing h1 receptors and nf-îbluciferase, basal constitutive luciferase activity was elevated 44% relative to that of cells expressing nf-îb-luciferase alone (fig. 1). incubation for 24 h with h1 antihistamines reduced basal luciferase activity, indicating that
the antihistamines acted as  xxxg1078xxx  inverse agonists
(fig. 2; table 1).  xxxd1846xxx  demonstrated the most potent inverse agonism among the antihistamines tested,
with an ic50 of 0.67 b 0.41 nm (n = 7). the rank order of
potency was  xxxd1846xxx  1  xxxd3050xxx  1 cetirizine 1
loratadine 1 fexofenadine. in cos-7 cells that expressed
only nf-îb-luciferase and not the  xxxg1078xxx , no effect
on constitutive nf-îb activity was noted, indicating that
 xxxd1846xxx  and the other h1 antihistamines mediated
their effects on nf-îb via inverse agonism at the h1
receptor (data not shown).
in cos-7 cells co-expressing the  xxxg1078xxx  and the
nf-îb-luciferase reporter gene, incubation for 24 h with
histamine resulted in a concentration-dependent rise in
nf-îb activity with an ec50 value of 740 b 100 nm

(n = 4) (fig. 3). the maximal, 8-fold increase from baseline
luciferase activity occurred following incubation with
10 –4 m histamine. control cells that contained the nfîb-luciferase reporter gene but not the  xxxg1078xxx  demonstrated no increase in luciferase activity following incubation with histamine for 24 h, indicating that histamineinduced increases in nf-îb were h1-receptor-mediated
(fig. 1).
co-incubation for 24 h with histamine (10 –5 m) and
h1 antihistamines inhibited the histamine-induced rise in
nf-îb activity, although no compound fully suppressed
histamine-induced nf-îb activity (fig. 4).  xxxd1846xxx 
was the most potent inhibitor of histamine-induced nfîb activity, with a ki of 0.25 b 0.13 nm (n = 5) (table 2).

discussion

histamine h1 receptors, like some other members of
the gpcr superfamily, are constitutively active in the
absence of bound agonist [5, 6]. the phenomenon was

first observed with stimulation of inositol phosphate formation in cells transfected with recombinant receptor
[14] and was subsequently extended to activation of basal
nf-îb activity [6], which is a key regulator of gene
expression in response to allergic inflammatory signals.
antagonists that inhibit this constitutive activity in the
absence of agonist are said to be inverse agonists. a number of antihistamines have been characterized as inverse
agonists with effects on constitutive nf-îb activity. in
this study, we have demonstrated, using a luciferase
reporter gene assay, that  xxxd1846xxx , heretofore uncharacterized in this regard, inhibits constitutive h1receptor-mediated nf-îb activity. this supports the concept that all currently available h1 ‘antagonists’ are inverse
agonists at the  xxxg1078xxx  [14, 15]. we have shown pre-

316

int arch allergy immunol 2004;135:313–318

viously in competition binding studies that  xxxd1846xxx 
is a more potent antagonist at the  xxxg1078xxx  than other
commonly used antihistamines [13]. our current results
indicate that the general rank order of potency of h1
inverse agonism resembles that of h1 antagonism.
nf-îb is one of a number of cytosolic transcription
factors that play an important role in the expression of
specific genes in response to activation of membranebound receptors [16]. nf-îb exists primarily in the form
of a heterodimer of nf-îb1 and rela subunits, the latter
of which contains a nuclear localization sequence [17]. in
its inactive state, nf-îb is complexed to its inactivator,
i-îb, which protects the nuclear localization sequence
[18]. i-îb is itself inactivated by serine phosphorylation,
and is subsequently removed and degraded [19]. the factor responsible for i-îb serine phosphorylation, i-îb
kinase, is modulated by upstream signals originating from
membrane receptors. once decomplexed from i-îb, nfîb translocates to the nucleus and binds to îb domains
on promoter regions of a wide variety of genes that encode
inflammatory proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines
[20]. promoter-bound nf-îb aids transcription by a variety of dna remodeling proteins, ribonuclear binding proteins and transcription factors, a process that can eventually lead to mrna expression and protein synthesis [21].
nf-îb influences the activity of genes that encode important allergic inflammatory mediators, such as the highly
inducible gene promoters for the chemokines il-8 and
 xxxg363xxx  [22], and intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(icam-1) [23]. furthermore, inflammatory signaling via
cell surface receptors for the inflammatory cytokines il1ß and tnf-· is mediated in part by nf-îb [24]. normal

wu/anthes/kreutner/harris/west

nf-îb activity is required to permit inflammatory responses to occur. marquardt and walker [25] have shown
that in mice with a mutant form of i-îb (which did not
undergo phosphorylation), ige activation of mast cells
failed to result in expression of mrna or protein for the
inflammatory cytokine il-6. others have shown that
eosinophilic responses are disrupted [26], and il-4 and
il-13 secretion is inhibited in mice deficient in nf-îb
subunits [27, 28].
signaling via the  xxxg1078xxx  causes activation of phospholipases, including phospholipase c and the accumulation of inositol triphosphate [5, 10], although pathways
involving protein kinase c have also been implicated [29].
histamine activation of nf-îb appears to be mediated
via changes in intracellular calcium levels. for instance,
hu et al. [30] found that histamine stimulation in endothelial cells decreased the frequency of intracellular calcium oscillations and caused a parallel, 14-fold increase in
nf-îb activity. cellular activation by ige and the release
of the inflammatory cytokines are also mediated by
increased intracellular calcium [31], protein kinase activation [32] and are associated with increased nf-îb
translocation to the nucleus [33]. a blockade of intracellular calcium abolishes both ige-induced nf-îb translocation and cytokine release [31]. an h1 antihistamine such
as  xxxd1846xxx  could potentially decrease allergen-igeinduced mast cell activation by reducing nf-îb activity
via  xxxg1078xxx  inverse agonism. indeed, reduced mast
cell and basophil activation and cytokine release in response to anti-ige or calcium ionophore have been demonstrated with  xxxd1846xxx  in a variety of in vitro models [34, 35]. the mechanism by which  xxxd1846xxx  acts
at the  xxxg1078xxx  is probably linked to alterations in
intracellular calcium concentrations. berthon et al. [36]
demonstrated that  xxxd1846xxx  (2.5–50 ìm) decreased
antigen-induced rises in intracellular calcium in basophil
leukemic cells in vitro by both inhibiting the intracellular
mobilization of calcium and the influx of extracellular calcium.

in the clinical setting,  xxxd1846xxx  has been shown to
improve both early- (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itch) and
late-phase (nasal obstruction) symptoms of allergic rhinitis, with the latter effect potentially due to downregulation
of allergic inflammatory cytokine responses [37].  xxxd1846xxx  reduces the generation of the cytokines il-4/il-13
[34], il-6, il-8 [38] and the adhesion molecules  xxxg2049xxx 
[39] and icam-1 [40] from human basophils, mast cells
and endothelium in vitro. some of these effects were demonstrated at nanomolar or subnanomolar concentrations,
which indicates that they may be clinically relevant. further in vivo animal studies have shown that  xxxd1846xxx 
has an immunomodulatory effect on allergic bronchial
inflammation in mice [41], while preliminary data in
patients with allergic rhinitis suggest that  xxxd1846xxx  at
its clinical dose reduces nasal mucosal inflammation during the allergy season [42]. downregulation of allergic
inflammation by an antihistamine may occur due to nfîb inhibition, which, in turn, could reduce the activation
of a variety of genes coding for inflammatory factors. in
support of this hypothesis, papi et al. [41] previously demonstrated that  xxxd1846xxx  inhibited rhinovirus-induced
icam-1 upregulation via decreased nuclear nf-îb binding in bronchial epithelial cells. in light of the in vitro
studies outlined above, the results of the current study are
consistent with  xxxd1846xxx  mediating important antiinflammatory effects via inverse agonism at the  xxxg1078xxx , which leads to alterations in second messenger concentrations and decreased cytosolic calcium, which, in
turn, produces reduced nf-îb activity.
in conclusion,  xxxd1846xxx  is a potent  xxxd1422xxx 
at the  xxxg1078xxx  and reduces both basal and histaminestimulated nf-îb activity. the rank order of potency for
basal  xxxg1078xxx  inverse agonism was similar to that for
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonism:  xxxd1846xxx  1  xxxd3050xxx  1
cetirizine 1 loratadine 1 fexofenadine. it remains to be
determined whether this comparatively greater inverse
agonistic action of  xxxd1846xxx  at the  xxxg1078xxx  translates into benefits in terms of reduced allergic inflammation in vivo.
