airway remodeling in chronic asthma is characterized by increased
smooth muscle mass that is associated with the reduction of the
bronchial lumen as well as airway hyperresponsiveness. the development of agents that inhibit smooth muscle growth is therefore
of interest for therapy to prevent asthma-associated airway remodeling. all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra) suppresses growth of vascular
smooth muscle cells (smcs) from the systemic and pulmonary circulation. the present study investigated the effects of atra on human
bronchial (airway) smcs. human bronchial smcs were found to
express mrnas for  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar)-␣, -␤, -␥, and retinoid x receptor (rxr)-␣, -␤, but not rxr-␥. although atra was
not effective in inhibiting proliferation or in inducing apoptosis in
airway smcs, we found that atra (0.2–2 ␮m) inhibited the smc
migration in response to platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf), as
determined in a modified boyden chamber assay. both rar and
rxr agonists also blocked pdgf-induced airway smc migration.
atra also inhibited pdgf-induced actin reorganization associated
with migration. pdgf-induced actin reorganization and migration
were blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3k)
and akt. however, migration was blocked by inhibitors of the mek/
erk pathway, with no effect on cytoskeletal reorganization. atra
suppressed pdgf-induced akt activation without influencing erk
activation. rar was found to form protein–protein interactions with
the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  pi3k subunit. these results suggest that  xxxd3417xxx  inhibits airway smc migration through the modulation of the pi3k/akt
pathway.

asthma is a chronic airway disorder characterized by airﬂow
obstruction, airway inﬂammation, and persistent airway hyperreactivity (1). although airway remodeling involves alterations
of several of cell types, airway smooth muscle cells (smcs)
appear to play a critical role. the airway smcs change from a
contractile phenotype to a proliferative (or synthetic) phenotype
characterized by increased growth, migration, production of extracellular matrix proteins, and secretion of a variety of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors (2). not surprisingly, the
proliferative/synthetic phenotype also has reduced expression
of contractile proteins (2, 3).

the change in airway smc phenotype is believed to occur
after exposure to growth factors, which initiate smc proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and cause migration of these cells. several
factors have been identiﬁed that may aid the phenotypic switch of
airway smcs, including platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf),
 xxxg681xxx , and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(2, 3), and these factors have been shown to be elevated in the
plasma of patients with asthma (4, 5). importantly, growth arrest
of the proliferative/synthetic smcs in culture restores the cells
to a contractile phenotype (3). the ability of growth arrest to
revert the pathologic phenotype of airway smcs has led to a
search for pharmacologic agents to inhibit airway smc growth.
all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra) is an active metabolite of
 xxxd3105xxx  that has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of
cancer cells (6), some types of epithelial cells (7), and vascular
smooth muscles (8–10). atra inhibits pdgf-induced proliferation and induces apoptosis in rat and human aortic smcs (11–
13). in cultured pulmonary artery smcs, atra inhibits serotonin-induced proliferation (8). in vivo studies indicate that atra
reduces systemic and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle remodeling; both in the carotid artery balloon injury model system in
rats (9), and in pulmonary hypertension induced by monocrotaline in rats (14), atra inhibited remodeling, primarily through
the regulation of smc growth.
the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar) and retinoid x receptors
(rxr) mediate the biological effects of atra. these receptors
are members of the superfamily of steroid hormone ligand–
activated transcription factors (15, 16). rar bind atra as well
as 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , a naturally occurring isomer, whereas the
rxr bind only 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx . when bound to their ligand,
rar–rxr heterodimers activate gene transcription by binding
to speciﬁc promoter elements (16), and also affect the activities
of other transcription factors, such as activator protein (ap)-1
(17). atra has additionally been demonstrated to directly interfere with the activation of signal transduction proteins, including
extracellular signal–regulated kinases  xxxd1355xxx /p42 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) (18), as
well as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3k) and akt (19). thus,
atra regulation of cell activities potentially occurs through both
nuclear and cytoplasmic mechanisms; studies suggest that the operative mechanism in any case is cell-type–speciﬁc.
the present study examined effects of atra on airway smc
growth and migration. although atra has little or no effect
on airway smooth muscle proliferation and apoptosis, we found
that atra is an effective inhibitor of airway smc migration
induced by pdgf. the mechanisms of atra actions involve
its ability to inhibit pi3k/akt-dependent reorganization of actin
cytoskeleton.

from adult bovine pulmonary artery and cultured in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fbs, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and
0.5%  xxxd164xxx , as previously described (20). cells at passages 2–6
were used for experiments. atra, 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , 13-cis retinoic
acid (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo), 4-[e-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl] xxxd306xxx  ( xxxd1058xxx ) and
 xxxd1079xxx  (biomol, plymouth meeting, pa) were dissolved
in dmso for stock solutions. for working solutions, a further dilution
was made using cell culture medium with no serum, so that the ﬁnal
concentration of dmso did not exceed 0.02%.

methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay
human bronchial smcs were cultured in 96-well plates for 24 h in
dmem containing 10% fbs followed by 72 h of growth arrest in
dmem containing 0.1% fbs. human bronchial smcs were then
treated with pdgf (10 ng/ml) with or without 30-min atra (2 ␮m)
pretreatment, or atra alone, for 4 d. medium was aspirated, and 100
␮l/well of methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (mtt, sigmaaldrich) solution was added (0.5 mg/ml mtt in serum free dmem).
cells were incubated at 37⬚c, 5% co2, for 4 h. mtt stain was aspirated,
and 150 ␮l/well of dmso was added; the plate was then agitated for
5 min before reading at 570 nm, with 595-nm reference, in a spectramax

measurements of apoptosis
the neutral comet assay was used to measure double-stranded dna
breaks as an indication of apoptosis, as previously described (21). cells
were treated with apoptotic stimuli, washed in pbs, embedded in 1%
agarose, and placed on a comet slide (trevigen, gaithersburg, md).
cells were then placed in lysis solution (2.5 m nacl, 1% na-lauryl
sarcosinate, 100 mm edta, 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx , 0.01% triton x-100)
for 30 min. the nuclei were subsequently electrophoresed for 20 min
at 1 v/cm in 1⫻ tris/borate/edta buffer (tbe; 5⫻ tbe stock has
250 mm tris, 250 mm boric acid, and 5 mm edta), ﬁxed in ethanol,
followed by staining with sybr green (molecular probes, eugene, or)
and visualization with a ﬂuorescence microscope at 478 nm excitation
and 507 nm emission wavelengths. between 100 and 150 comets were
scored per experiment and assigned into type-a, -b, or -c categories
based on their tail moments. type-c comets were deﬁned as apoptotic
cells, as described by krown and colleagues (22).
for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine

results
effects of atra on airway smc proliferation and apoptosis

atra typically inhibits 50–90% of aortic or pulmonary smc
proliferation induced by growth factors (8, 10, 11, 13, 23). we
tested the hypothesis that atra may also inhibit the proliferation of airway smcs. to induce proliferation, human bronchial
smcs were treated with pdgf with or without pretreatment
with atra. in contrast with ﬁndings from vascular smcs, we
found that atra reduced pdgf-induced proliferation of airway smcs by only 5–10% (figure 1a).
atra has also been shown to induce apoptosis of vascular
smcs (12). the neutral comet assay, which determines the incidence of double-stranded dna breaks, was used to demonstrate
that atra treatment induced apoptosis of bovine and human
pulmonary artery smc (figure 1b). in contrast, apoptotic cell
death was not produced in response to atra in human bronchial airway smc, as monitored by comet assay (figure 1c).
similarly, tunel assay (figure 1d) and the measurement of
mitochondrial membrane potential (figure 1e) failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant apoptosis by atra in airway smcs. positive
controls,  xxxd1816xxx  (dnr) and  xxxd2298xxx , effectively elicited apoptosis in airway smc.
effects of atra on airway smc morphology,
actin polymerization, and migration

treatment of airway smcs with pdgf induces an alteration of
airway smc shape (figure 2a). cells appear to be more elongated, with multiple processes extending from the cell body.
these changes in morphologic characteristics in response to
pdgf are not accompanied by indications of cell death. atra
pretreatment attenuated pdgf-induced processes from forming
on the cells.
the actin cytoskeleton of airway smcs is also altered in
response to pdgf treatment (figure 2b). untreated airway
smcs contain multiple actin stress ﬁbers, mostly oriented along
the length of the cell body. with pdgf treatment, the cells
appear to lose most of the actin stress ﬁbers. these changes are
consistent with cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during
migratory responses (24). atra treatment alone did not appear
to alter the actin ﬁbers. however, pretreatment with atra
inhibited most of the actin rearrangement of pdgf.
because atra inhibited both morphologic and actin cytoskeletal changes induced by pdgf, we characterized the effects of atra on pdgf-induced airway smc migration using
a modiﬁed boyden chamber assay, which allows for determination of motility in random directions. as shown in figure 2c,
pdgf caused a 4-fold increase in migration of airway smcs
after 24 h, and atra blocked these events. atra by itself

699

had no effect. while the therapeutic level of atra in human
plasma could reach 1–2 ␮m (25), the effects on airway smc
migration were observed with atra concentrations as low as
0.2 ␮m (figure 2d). dmso, which is used as vehicle for atra
and other retinoids, has no effect on pdgf-induced airway smc
migration. this does not appear to be due to the effects of
atra on cell proliferation, as mtt assay showed that atra
is not effective in inhibiting pdgf-induced cell proliferation;
additionally, migration assay with 4 h of pdgf treatment also
exhibits the ability of atra to inhibit migratory responses, as
monitored using a modiﬁed boyden chamber assay (figure 2e).
thus, although atra is ineffective in inhibiting proliferation
and inducing apoptosis of airway smcs, atra is an efﬁcient
inhibitor of airway smc migration. furthermore, our results
using  xxxd1800xxx , a general inhibitor of gene transcription
(figure 2f), showed that atra inhibition of smc migration
does not mediate gene transcriptional events.
atra inhibits pdgf activation of akt, but
not mek/erk

to further determine the mechanism of  xxxd3417xxx  actions,
signal transduction pathways were examined. two pathways,
pi3k/akt and mek/erk, have been shown to be involved in
activation of migration by a number of growth factors (26–28).
similarly to observations by goncharova and colleagues (29) in
pulmonary vascular smc, pdgf-induced airway smc migration appears to be dependent on pi3k/akt pathway, as a pi3k
inhibitor,  xxxd2523xxx  (figure 3a), inhibited pdgf-induced smc
migration. similarly, an inhibitor of mek,  xxxd3462xxx , also blocked
migration in response to pdgf (figure 3a). interestingly, although  xxxd2523xxx  is effective in inhibiting pdgf-induced actin
reorganization,  xxxd3462xxx  did not inhibit this activity (figure 3b),
suggesting that inhibition of migration by  xxxd3462xxx  occurs via a
different mechanism.
atra has been shown in carcinoma cells to inhibit the pi3k/
akt pathway (30). atra has also been shown to inhibit p42/
 xxxd1355xxx  erk activation in some cell types and activate erk in
others, including aortic smcs (31, 32). western blot experiments
using phosphospeciﬁc antibodies revealed that atra inhibits
pdgf-induced akt activation, although cellular levels of akt
were not changed (figure 4a). atra alone does not activate
erk in airway smc and does not affect either the phosphorylation of erk by pdgf or cellular levels of total erk protein
(figure 4b). smith and colleagues (18) reported that seruminduced nuclear translocation of phospho-erk is inhibited by
atra treatment in f9 carcinoma cells. we show that 30 min
pretreatment of airway smcs with atra does not inhibit nuclear translocation of pdgf-induced phospho-erk (figure
4c).
consistent with our ﬁnding that akt activation is blocked by
atra, smc migration was inhibited by adenovirus-mediated
gene transfer of dominant negative akt (dnakt) (figure 5a).
moreover, a constitutive active mutant of akt attenuated the
inhibition of migration by atra (figure 5b).
roles of rar

aortic smcs (11) and pulmonary artery smcs (8) express
rar␣, rar␤, rar␥, rxr␣, and rxr␤, but not rxr␥.
given the different response of the airway smcs to atra
compared with vascular smcs, we hypothesized that airway
smcs may express a different subset of atra receptors, and
rt-pcr was used to determine the receptor expression patterns
in airway smcs. as shown in figure 6a, 30 cycles of pcr
generated products of 201, 752, and 327 bp, which correspond
to rar␣, rar␤, and rar␥, respectively. detection of rxr

figure 4. atra inhibits pdgf activation of akt, but not activation of erk. bronchial smcs were grown to 80% confluence, placed in serum-free medium overnight, and then
treated with pdgf (10 ng/ml), with or without pretreatment

required 40 cycles of pcr, which generated 93- and 510-bp
products, corresponding to rxr␣ and rxr␤, respectively.
however, the rxr␥ product with the expected size of 532 bp
was not generated. we have performed pcr up to 50 cycles to
conﬁrm that rxr␥ is not detectable. control experiments with
no reverse transcription show that no bands were produced,
conﬁrming that our pcr products resulted from cdna and not
from contaminating genomic dna. these results indicate that,
similarly to vascular smcs, airway smcs express rar␣, rar␤,
rar␥, rxr␣, and rxr␤, but not rxr␥.
treatment of the airway smcs with atra increased dna
binding toward both rar and rxr response elements, as demonstrated by emsa (figure 6b). these results are similar to
those we obtained previously using human pulmonary artery
smcs (8). these results conﬁrm that, in human bronchial smcs,
rar and rxr are functional dna-binding proteins.

pharmacologic methods were used to determine the identities
of speciﬁc rars and rxrs required for the inhibition of pdgfinduced smc migration by atra.  xxxd1058xxx  (rar agonist) and
 xxxd1079xxx  (rxr agonist) both mimicked the actions of
atra in the inhibition of pdgf-induced airway smc migration (figure 6c). these results indicate that the activation of
either rar or rxr is sufﬁcient to block the migratory effects
of pdgf. this suggests that rar-rxr heterodimer activation
may be involved in the mechanism of atra inhibition of
pdgf-induced migration. in addition to atra, biological  xxxd2071xxx  include 9-cis and 13-cis  xxxd2071xxx . although
atra is a natural agonist for rar, 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  can
activate both rar and rxr. although  xxxd2404xxx  does
not directly affect these receptors, it can be isomerized to atra
or 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx . we found that both 9-cis and 13-cis retinoic
acid isomers are effective inhibitors of pdgf-induced airway

discussion

figure 5. effects of adenovirus expressing akt mutants on the atra
inhibition of pdgf-induced smc migration. hbsmcs were infected for
24 h with (a ) adenovirus expressing dominant negative akt (dnakt) or
control adenovirus (control adv), or (b ) with adenovirus expressing
constitutively active akt (caakt adv) or control adenovirus. cells were
then split into migration chambers, were allowed to attach to membranes for 2 h, and were then treated with pdgf (10 ng/ml), with or
without 30-min pretreatment with atra (2 ␮m). cell were fixed,
stained, and counted 20 h after treatment. bar graphs represent
means ⫾ sem. * significantly different values from control at p ⬍ 0.05.
western blot results for the expression of akt mutants are also shown.

smc migration (figure 6d). inhibitory effects were comparable
to that exerted by atra.
to provide evidence for the possible roles of rar in pi3k/
akt pathway inhibition, we explored whether rar might interact with pi3k. immunoprecipitation/western blot experiments
revealed that, in human bronchial smc, rar␣ forms protein–

the major ﬁnding of this study is that atra and other biologically active retinoids inhibit airway smc migration in the absence of antiproliferative or apoptotic effects. atra inhibits
pdgf activation of the pi3k/akt pathway in airway smc, but
does not block phosphorylation or nuclear localization of p42/
 xxxd1355xxx  erk. we also show that inhibition of akt, by the adenoviral
expression of a dnakt, can block pdgf-induced migration, and
the expression of constitutively active akt attenuates the inhibition by atra of pdgf-induced migration. finally, we demonstrate that rar␣ can form protein–protein interactions with
the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  pi3k subunit in human airway smc.
the scheme in figure 7 describes a model in which retinoids
affect airway smc migration. pdgf activation of airway smc
migration requires both mek/erk and pi3k/akt pathways.
inhibition of pi3k/akt by either pharmaceutical inhibitors or
dnakt blocks both migration and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, but inhibition of erk blocks migration without
inhibiting actin changes. atra or its isomers bind a retinoid
binding protein and prevent pdgf activation of akt, possibly
by blocking the upstream activation of pi3k. the identity of
the atra binding protein directly involved in pi3k/akt regulation in airway smcs is still under investigation in our laboratories. another retinoid binding protein, the cellular retinolbinding protein-i, has been shown to act as an inhibitor of pi3k
by directly blocking heterodimerization of the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  and p110
pi3k subunits in breast epithelial cells (30), which might serve
as the target of atra in airway smcs. atra has also been
shown to affect the subcellular localization of pi3k and  xxxg1369xxx /2
in carcinoma cells (18, 33). the mechanisms by which atra
regulates subcellular localization of signal transduction proteins
is also not well deﬁned, although an intact actin cytoskeleton
appears to be required for regulation of erk (18).
interestingly, atra does not result in growth arrest or apoptosis of airway smcs, despite the fact that airway smcs express
the same proﬁle of rars and rxrs as vascular smcs, which
readily undergo apoptosis with atra treatment. consequently,
it appears that the effects of atra are speciﬁc for smcs of
different tissue origins. the mechanism of atra regulation of
smc growth has been shown to involve both nuclear (gene
regulatory) and non-nuclear actions (10, 34, 35). although we
have determined that atra regulation of migration in airway
smcs involves the pi3k/akt and not the erk pathway, the
signaling pathway(s), which allow airway smcs to proliferate
in the presence of atra, require further investigation.
recently, work from our group demonstrated that patients
with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension have decreased
levels of plasma retinoids (8). we also found that atra inhibits
proliferation of pulmonary artery smcs. given the possibility
that atra may negatively regulate pulmonary artery smc
mass, the decreased atra level in the plasma of pulmonary
hypertension patients implies a potential role of this speciﬁc
retinoid in pulmonary vascular remodeling. decreased levels of
plasma retinol, a precursor of atra, have been found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; this disease,
like asthma, often includes increased smooth muscle mass in
airway remodeling (36). further work is required to determine
whether plasma levels of atra are involved in reduced inhibition of airway smc migration in patients with asthma. naturally

occurring negative regulatory agents, such as atra, may provide novel strategies for prevention of airway remodeling. furthermore, the results of the present study, together with those
of a recent work by fang and coworkers (37), showing that
atra inhibited airway inﬂammation in asthmatic rats, suggest

that atra might have beneﬁcial effects in patients with asthma
through multiple mechanisms.
