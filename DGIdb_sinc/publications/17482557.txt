abstract
folate-activated one-carbon units are derived from serine through the activity of the pyridoxal-phosphate (plp)-dependent isozymes
of serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ). the eﬀect of  xxxd3049xxx  availability on the activity and expression of the human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic  xxxg2069xxx  isozymes was investigated in human mcf-7 cells. cells were cultured for 6 months in  xxxd3049xxx  replete
(4.9 lm pyridoxine) minimal essential medium (amem) or  xxxd3049xxx -deﬁcient medium containing 49, 4.9 or 0.49 nm pyridoxine. total
cellular plp levels and  xxxg2069xxx  activity were reduced 72% and 7%, respectively, when medium pyridoxine was decreased from 4.9 lm to
49 nm. cells cultured in medium containing 4.9 nm pyridoxine exhibited 75%, 27% and 60% reduced levels of plp,  xxxg2069xxx  activity and
s- xxxd3156xxx , respectively, compared to cells cultured in amem. cytoplasmic  xxxg2069xxx  activity and protein levels, but not
mrna levels, were decreased in cells cultured in  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁcient medium, whereas mitochondrial  xxxg2069xxx  activity and protein levels
were less sensitive to  xxxd3049xxx  availability. plp bound to cytoplasmic  xxxg2069xxx  with a kd = 850 nm, a value two orders of magnitude
lower than previously reported for the bovine cytoplasmic  xxxg2069xxx  isozyme. collectively, these data indicate that  xxxd3049xxx  restriction
decreases the activity and stability of  xxxg2069xxx , and that the cytoplasmic isozyme is more sensitive to  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency than the mitochondrial isozyme in mcf-7 cells.

pyridoxal-phosphate is a cofactor for the mitochondrial
and cytoplasmic isozymes of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cshmt1 and mshmt), the p-protein of the glycine
cleavage system, cystathionine b-synthase (cbs) and
c-cystathionase, all of which contribute to homocysteine
metabolism either through folate-mediated one-carbon
metabolism or the transsulfuration pathway (fig. 1).
folate cofactors carry and chemically activate single carbons for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate and methionine [1]. the single carbons are derived from serine and
glycine through the activity of three plp- and folate*

dependent enzymes: the mshmt and  xxxg2068xxx  isozymes
and the glycine cleavage system [2–4].  xxxg2069xxx  catalyzes
the reversible interconversion of serine and thf to methylenethf and glycine [5]. in mitochondria, serine is converted to glycine and formate through a folate-dependent
pathway initiated by mshmt. formate derived in the
mitochondria is a major source of one-carbon units for
cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism through its conversion
to 10-formylthf by the enzyme 10-formylthf synthetase
[6]. alternatively,  xxxg2068xxx  can generate folate-activated
one-carbon units from serine in the cytoplasm in the form
of methylenethf [7] (fig. 1).
in the cytoplasm, methionine can be adenylated to
form s- xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) which serves as a
cofactor for cellular methylation reactions, including the
methylation of proteins, dna, rna, phospholipids and
neurotransmitters. s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ), a

fig. 1. the role of plp in folate-mediated one-carbon and homocysteine metabolism. tetrahydrofolate (thf)-mediated one-carbon metabolism is
required for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. the hydroxymethyl group of serine is the major
source of one-carbon units which are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate in a reaction initiated by the plp-dependent enzyme mshmt,
or in the cytoplasm through the activity of  xxxg2068xxx . formate derived in mitochondria can enter the cytoplasm and function as a one-carbon unit for folate
metabolism. the transsulfuration pathway is initiated by the plp-dependent enzyme cbs. the one carbon is labeled in ‘‘bold’’.  xxxg1475xxx ,

product of  xxxd3156xxx -dependent reactions, is hydrolyzed to
yield homocysteine, which can be metabolized by the
remethylation or transsulfuration pathway (fig. 1). the
generation of 5-methylthf, which is a cofactor for
folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation, requires
plp. likewise, the metabolism of homocysteine by the
transsulfuration pathway is initiated by the plp-dependent
enzyme cbs.
elevated serum homocysteine is a biomarker for folate
deﬁciency and/or impaired folate metabolism, and is an
independent risk factor for vascular disease.  xxxd3049xxx 
deﬁciency is also associated with elevations in serum homocysteine. one study in humans indicated that marginal  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency did not aﬀect homocysteine
remethylation or synthesis in the absence of dietary methionine intake [8]. other studies of  xxxd3049xxx -restricted rats
indicated that the homocysteine remethylation and the
transsulfuration pathways were compromised in rats fed
 xxxd3049xxx -deﬁcient diets, thereby indicating that both
 xxxg2069xxx  and cbs were sensitive to dietary intake of vitamin
b6. plp binds tightly to cbs (kd = 700 nm [9]) and cystathionase (kd = 1.4 lm [10]). however, the dissociation
constant for the interaction of plp with puriﬁed bovine
 xxxg2068xxx  was reported to be 27.5 lm [11]. this observation
lead [12] to predict that folate-dependent remethylation of
homocysteine may be more sensitive to  xxxd3049xxx  restriction than the transsulfuration pathway.
in this study, the interaction of plp with the human
 xxxg2069xxx  isozymes was investigated in mcf-7 cells to determine the inﬂuence of plp availability on mshmt and
 xxxg2068xxx  activity, expression, and on the cellular methylation potential.

materials and methods
materials
all reagents were analytical grade unless otherwise noted.  xxxd3392xxx ,  xxxd3156xxx ,  xxxd3157xxx , glycine, pyridoxine and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate
were obtained from sigma. [3h] glycine was obtained from perkin–elmer.
1-heptanesulfonic acid was obtained from acros. sodium phosphate,
phosphoric acid and hplc grade methanol were purchased from fisher.

cell culture in pyridoxine deﬁcient medium
mcf-7 cells were passaged for 6 months in modiﬁed minimal essential
medium (amem) that lacked nucleotides, nucleosides but contained 10%
dialyzed and charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, 250 lm serine, 10 lm
methionine, 0.2 mm glycine, 50 nm 5-formylthf and one of ﬁve diﬀerent
concentrations of pyridoxine. under these culture conditions, functional
folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is essential for cell survival. cells
were cultured either in modiﬁed amem which contained 1 mg/l (4.9 lm)
pyridoxine (referred to as amem), amem containing 0.01 mg/l (49 nm)
pyridoxine, amem containing 0.001 mg/l (4.9 nm) pyridoxine, amem
containing 0.0001 mg/l (0.49 nm) pyridoxine and amem containing
0.00001 mg/l (0.049 nm) pyridoxine. intracellular plp concentrations
were monitored during the repletion period to ensure steady-state levels of
intracellular plp were achieved for each culture condition.

determination of cellular plp
frozen cell pellets (10–30 million cells) were vortexed in 700 ll of milliq water; 500 ll of cellular lysate was used for hplc analysis and the
remaining 200 ll was used for determination of protein concentration [13].
a solution of  xxxd3392xxx  and glycine (250 mg/ml) was added to 500 ll
of cellular lysate or plp standards such that the  xxxd3392xxx  was in a
molar excess of plp (>10 mg/ml) in the sample or standard. the samples
or standards were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.
protein was precipitated with the addition of 70% trichloroacetic acid and
the solution was clariﬁed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min). the

c. perry et al. / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 462 (2007) 21–27
supernatant was collected and 30–50 ll of a 25% sodium hydroxide
solution was added to achieve a ph between 3.0 and 5.0. chromatagraphic
separation was performed by hplc using a c18 luna phenomenex column (5 l 100 å, 25 cm · 4.6 mm) and an isocratic mobile phase consisting
of 60 mm sodium phosphate (ph 6.5), 400 mg/l of edta, and 9.5%
methanol. the derivatized plp was quantiﬁed using a shimadzu rf-10a
ﬂuorescence detector using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380
and 450 nm, respectively [14].

western blot analyses of  xxxg2068xxx , mshmt and  xxxg861xxx 
cell pellets were homogenized by sonication in 10 mm tris, ph 7.5,
150 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 5 mm edta, 1% triton x-100, 20 mm
 xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. the lysates
were cleared by centrifugation and the soluble protein concentration of the
supernatant determined [13]. protein extracts (60 lg/lane) were run on an
8% sds–page gel, then transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride microporous membrane (millipore) using a minitransblot apparatus (biorad). for detection of  xxxg2068xxx , mshmt and  xxxg861xxx , the membrane
was incubated overnight at 4 c with puriﬁed polyclonal antibodies generated in sheep (1:10,000 dilution). the membrane was washed in phosphate-buﬀered saline containing 0.1% tween 20, then incubated for 2 h
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep secondary
antibody (1:6500 dilution; pierce). proteins were visualized using the super
signal west pico chemiluminescent detection system (pierce). the protein
bands were quantiﬁed using chemiimager 4400 from alpha innotech
corp. (san leandro, ca).

determination of s- xxxd3156xxx  and
s- xxxd3157xxx 
cellular  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels were determined by hplc. all
sample and standards were prepared and derivatized as described
previously [15]. following derivativization, cell extracts were applied to a
5 l, 25 cm·4.6 mm c8 column and separated using a binary buﬀer system
consisting of: buﬀer a (25 mm sodium phosphate, ph 3.0, 10 mm
1-heptanesulfonic acid and 18% methanol) and buﬀer b (25 mm sodium
phosphate, 10 mm 1-heptanesulfonic acid and 30% methanol). plp was
eluted from the column using a binary gradient follows: 0–10 min, 100% of
buﬀer a; 10–20 min, linear gradient of 0–100% of buﬀer b; 20–30 min,
100% of buﬀer b; 30–35 min, linear gradient of 100–0% buﬀer b and
35–40 min, equilibration with 100% buﬀer a. the ﬂuorescent  xxxd3156xxx  and
 xxxd3157xxx  derivatives were detected using a using a shimadzu rf-10a
ﬂuorescence detector using excitation and emission wavelengths of 270
and 410 nm, respectively.  xxxd3157xxx  standards and samples eluted between
11 and 16 min, whereas  xxxd3156xxx  eluted between 29 and 33 min.

puriﬁcation of mitochondria
mcf-7 cells 5 · 106 in 1.0 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buﬀer,
ph 7.5, containing 300 mm sucrose were disrupted by 50 strokes of a
dounce homogenizer (wheaton pestle a (tight ﬁtting)), and the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described previously [16].  xxxg861xxx  and cox iv proteins were used as cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial markers, respectively, by western blot analyses. cox iv
was not present in the cytoplasmic fraction; hence there was no need to
correct for mitochondrial breakage. mitochondrial fractions were determined to be free of  xxxg861xxx  protein and therefore were not corrected for
 xxxg2068xxx  contamination. protein concentrations were determined by the
method of lowry as described previously using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard [13].

activity assay
a sensitive radioassay was used to measure mshmt and  xxxg2068xxx 
enzyme activity in cell extracts from as few as 1 · 106 cultured cells as
described previously [16,17]. the assay is based on the observation that

23

thf accelerates the  xxxg2069xxx -catalyzed exchange of the pro-2s proton of
glycine, and that 5-formylthf inhibits this reaction [18]. isolated mitochondria were lysed in 200 ll of 20 mm sodium phosphate buﬀer, ph 7.2,
10 mm  xxxd26xxx , 0.5% triton x-100. mshmt activity was
measured by diluting 40 ll of the mitochondrial fraction to 500 ll with
10 mm potassium phosphate buﬀer, ph 7.5, 10 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
and glycine such that the ﬁnal glycine concentration was 1 mm with a
speciﬁc activity of 2 · 106 dpm/lmol. the reaction was initiated by the
addition of thf (1 mm) and incubated at 37 c for 30–120 min. control
reactions were performed to correct for background exchange by the
addition of 5-formylthf (1 mm) in lieu of thf. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of 50 mm hcl (4 c), and the solution
was passed through a column containing 0.8 ml of dowex 50ag (biorad) to sequester the radiolabeled glycine. the column was washed with
an additional 2 ml of 50 mm hcl, and the tritiated water was collected
and quantiﬁed by scintillation counting. control reactions containing
5-formylthf exhibited less than 4% proton exchange compared with the
thf-catalyzed exchange reaction. all assays were performed in duplicate,
and all experiments were repeated at least twice.

message level determination
total rna was extracted using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca, usa) according to the manufacture’s instructions. cdna was prepared using the high-capacity cdna archive kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa).
brieﬂy, the reaction mixture contained reverse transcriptase (rt) buﬀer,
rt random primers, dntp mixture, dnase- and rnase-free water,
multiscribe rt enzyme and 8 lg sample rna per reaction. the reaction
was incubated for 10 min at 25 c followed by 120 min at 37 c.  xxxg861xxx 
and  xxxg2068xxx  mrna were quantiﬁed using fam-labeled probes purchased from applied biosystems (assay-on-demand gene expression
products). the components of a 25 ll gene expression assay reaction
included 12.5 ll of a taqman universal pcr master mix (amperase
ung), 1.25 ll of 20· fam-labeled probe, 5 ll of diluted cdna and
6.25 ll of water. the reaction samples were loaded onto an optical reaction plate and covered with optical adhesive cover (applied biosystems).
the reaction was performed using an abi prism 7500 sequence detection
system (applied biosystems). the mixture was incubated for 2 min at
50 c and for 10 min at 95 c, followed by 40 cycles of pcr at 95 c for
15 s and at 60 c for 1 min. all samples were performed in triplicate. the
expression of  xxxg861xxx  was used for normalization of all samples.

puriﬁcation of recombinant human  xxxg2068xxx  protein
the expression and puriﬁcation of human recombinant  xxxg2068xxx  was
preformed as described previously [19]. escherichia coli cell pellets were
lysed in a buﬀer containing 40 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.0, and
10 mm  xxxd26xxx  using a french press, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. for puriﬁcation of the
recombinant  xxxg2068xxx  protein, the clariﬁed supernatant was applied
directly to a carboxymethyl sepharose ion exchange column, and the
protein was puriﬁed to homogeneity as described previously [19]. the
puriﬁed recombinant protein was greater than 95% pure as determined by
sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein concentrations were
determined by a modiﬁed lowry assay [13]. the puriﬁed protein was
stored at 80 c.

determination of the plp binding aﬃnity
apocshmt lacking plp was prepared as described previously [19].
the aﬃnity of plp for recombinant human apo- xxxg2068xxx  protein was
determined using a modiﬁcation of a previously described binding assay
[19]. the binding of reduced folate to  xxxg2069xxx  results in the formation of a
plp-glycine-quinonoid intermediate, which has an absorption maximum
at 502 nm ( = 40,000) [18]. the aposhmt (lacking bound plp) does not
form the quinonoid intermediate and therefore did not exhibit an increase

24

c. perry et al. / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 462 (2007) 21–27

in absorbance at 502 nm upon binding 5-formylthf. recombinant
human apo- xxxg2068xxx  protein (1 lm) was added to a cuvette that contained
1 ml of the reaction buﬀer (200 mm glycine, 50 mm hepes, ph 7.3, and
500 lm [6s]-5-formylthf (a value equal to 20· kd)). after a 30 min
incubation, the absorbance spectrum was recorded from 550 to 400 nm.
plp was added incrementally (to achieve ﬁnal concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8 or10 lm), and the spectrum was recorded. to determine the aﬃnity of
plp for apo- xxxg2068xxx  in the absence of glycine and 5-formylthf,  xxxg2068xxx 
and plp were incubated for 30 min, and the glycine and 5-formylthf
were added immediately before the spectra were recorded. to quantify the
aﬃnity of  xxxg2068xxx  for plp, the absorbance at 502 nm was recorded as a
function of plp added to the cuvette. the data were curve ﬁt by nonlinear
regression using prism software.

statistical analysis
diﬀerences in culture medium pyridoxine and  xxxg2069xxx  activity were
analyzed using one-way anova with newman–keuls pairwise comparison test using graphpad software.

results

of the plp content present in cells cultured in amem
(table 1). cells cultured in medium containing 4.9 or
0.49 nm pyridoxine did not display signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in cellular plp content compared to cells cultured in medium containing 49 nm pyridoxine. the reductions in cellular plp levels resulted in decreased cellular  xxxd3156xxx  levels
by 65% and 75% in cells cultured in medium containing 4.9
and 0.49 nm pyridoxine, respectively, compared to cells
cultured in amem.  xxxd3157xxx  levels were not aﬀected by
decreasing medium pyridoxine concentrations from
4900 nm to 4.9 nm, although  xxxd3157xxx  levels do not always
reﬂect cellular homocysteine metabolism because of its
export into the culture medium (table 1). overall, the
75% decrease in cellular plp levels resulted in nearly a
65% decrease in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio, often referred
to as the methylation capacity of the cell [21].
eﬀect of  xxxd3049xxx  availability on  xxxg2069xxx  protein, mrna
and activity

generation of plp-deﬁcient cells
mcf-7 cells were passaged for 6-months in either modiﬁed amem (4.9 lm pyridoxine) or modiﬁed amem containing either 49, 4.9, 0.49 or 0.049 nm pyridoxine to
ensure steady-state levels of intracellular plp were
achieved. culture medium was refreshed every 48 h. cells
passaged in medium containing 0.049 nm pyridoxine were
not viable after 2 months and were discarded. cells cultured in medium containing 0.49 nm pyridoxine demonstrated a slight attenuation of growth rate compared to
all other cell cultures (less than 25% inhibition of growth
rate, data not shown). after 6 months of passage, the cell
lines were expanded, harvested, and plp,  xxxd3156xxx ,  xxxd3157xxx ,  xxxg2069xxx  protein,  xxxg2069xxx  activity and  xxxg2069xxx  mrna
levels were quantiﬁed. the concentrations of  xxxd3049xxx 
in the culture medium are in the range of that found in
human plasma. in a recent large-scale epidemiological
study, the average plasma  xxxd3049xxx  level was about
50 nm, with a range of 19–150 nm [20].
eﬀect of  xxxd3049xxx  availability on cellular plp levels and
the cellular methylation potential in mcf-7 cells
cells cultured in medium with 49 nm pyridoxine contained 0.07 nmol plp/lg protein or approximately 25%

the  xxxg2069xxx  isozymes diﬀered in their sensitivity to plp
availability.  xxxg2068xxx  protein levels were sensitive to exogenous pyridoxine availability; cells cultured with 49, 4.9
and 0.49 nm pyridoxine exhibited a 10%, 33% and 60%
decrease in  xxxg2068xxx  protein levels, respectively, compared
to cells cultured in amem (fig. 2). these changes
occurred without decreases in  xxxg2068xxx  mrna levels
(table 2). the mshmt protein levels were less sensitive
than  xxxg2068xxx  protein levels to pyridoxine availability.
cells cultured in medium containing 49 and 4.9 nm pyridoxine exhibited a 5% increase in mshmt protein
whereas cells cultured with medium containing 0.49 nm
pyridoxine contained 44% less mshmt protein compared
to cells cultured in amem.
total  xxxg2069xxx  activity in cell extracts appeared to
reﬂect both the eﬀects of  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency on  xxxg2069xxx 
protein levels and the relative ratio of apoenzyme to
holoenzyme. total  xxxg2069xxx  activity in crude cell extracts
decreased by 7%, 27% and 58% in amem containing
49, 4.9 and 0.49 nm pyridoxine, respectively, compared
to extracts from cells cultured in amem (fig. 2a). addition of plp to the assay buﬀer, which converts all apoenzyme to active holoenzyme, increased total  xxxg2069xxx 
activity in all cell extracts (referred to as the stimulation
index).  xxxg2069xxx  activity was stimulated by 1.5-fold in

4.9 nm pyridoxine exhibited a 43% reduction in mshmt
activity, but an 89% reduction in  xxxg2068xxx  activity. the
addition of plp in the assay stimulated mshmt and
 xxxg2068xxx  activity in extracts from cells cultured in amem
containing 4.9 nm pyridoxine, but did not restore the
activity to levels observed in extracts from cells cultured
in amem; the magnitude of the stimulation was consistent with the observed change in total  xxxg2068xxx  and
mshmt protein levels (fig. 3).
aﬃnity of recombinant human  xxxg2068xxx  for plp
the dissociation constant for plp binding to  xxxg2068xxx 
was determined in the presence and absence of glycine
and 5-formylthf. the kd was determined to be 850 nm,
and was independent of both glycine and 5-formylthf
(fig. 3).
discussion
a recent study of rats fed ﬁve diets containing a range of
 xxxd3049xxx  levels from adequate to deﬁcient resulted in a
reduction of plasma plp from 900 to 70 nm and a 30%
reduction in liver plp content over the entire range [22].
in that study, both mshmt and  xxxg2068xxx  activities
decreased linearly with reductions in liver plp concentrations; total unstimulated  xxxg2069xxx  activity decreased over
the range from adequate to deﬁcient. although not investigated in that study, decreased protein levels were proposed
to account for the reduction in  xxxg2069xxx  activity as a function of plp status. interestingly, the ratio of aposhmt/
holoshmt did not change among the ﬁve dietary groups
for either  xxxg2069xxx  isozyme; apoenzyme consistently
accounted for 50% of total stimulated  xxxg2069xxx  activity
along the continuum of  xxxd3049xxx  status in rats (fig. 4).
there are three striking diﬀerences between the previous
study performed in rats and the results from the current
study of human mcf-7 cells. first, although total unstimulated  xxxg2069xxx  activity decreased with  xxxd3049xxx  availability, total stimulated  xxxg2069xxx  activity decreased only in the
cells cultured in the lowest pyridoxine concentrations
(amem with 0.49 nm pyridoxine). second, mshmt activity was not stimulated in crude extracts of mcf-7 cells cultured in amem, indicating that all of the mshmt protein
was plp-bound. third, the  xxxg2068xxx  and mshmt isozymes did not exhibit similar decreases in speciﬁc activity
as plp levels declined; the  xxxg2068xxx  was more sensitive to
plp availability. this study is also the ﬁrst to show that
 xxxg2069xxx  protein levels respond to plp availability.  xxxg2068xxx 
protein levels decreased with reduced plp availability,
whereas mshmt protein levels were increased in cells cultured in amem containing 49 nm and 4.9 nm pyridoxine
compared to cells cultured in amem. reductions in
 xxxg2068xxx  protein and activity as a function of decreasing
pyridoxine availability occurred without decreases in

fig. 4. the aﬃnity of plp for  xxxg2068xxx  in vitro. the increase in
absorbance at 502 nm resulting from the formation of a  xxxg2068xxx -plpgly-5-formylthf ternary complex was recorded as a function of plp in
the reaction buﬀer. a kd of 850 nm was determined by nonlinear
regression (95% conﬁdence interval: 0.5415–1.170; r2 = 0.9912).

 xxxg2068xxx  mrna levels, indicating that apocshmt is vulnerable to turnover.
cellular  xxxd3156xxx  levels decreased markedly with reductions in pyridoxine in the culture medium (table 1). previously, we have shown that  xxxg2068xxx  functions to inhibit the
generation of  xxxd3156xxx  in mcf-7 cells by sequestering 5methylthf and homocysteine remethylation [23]. therefore, reductions in  xxxg2068xxx  protein are not expected to
negatively aﬀect  xxxd3156xxx  levels. the reduction in  xxxd3156xxx 
likely reﬂects the conversion of holomshmt to apomshmt and decreased production of formate from serine
in the mitochondria; mcf-7 cells do not contain a plpdependent glycine cleavage system for formate production.
 xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency in rats also lead to depressed
 xxxd3156xxx  levels in liver [12].
finally, this study oﬀers some clarity regarding the aﬃnity of human  xxxg2068xxx  for plp. previously, one study determined that  xxxg2068xxx  puriﬁed from bovine liver exhibited a
kd of 27 lm for plp, whereas  xxxg2068xxx  puriﬁed from rabbit liver was reported to exhibit a kd of 700 nm for plp
[24]. in this study, we demonstrated that recombinant
human  xxxg2068xxx  binds plp with a kd of 850 nm, and this
value was independent of bound folate or glycine substrates. therefore, given the very high sequence identity
between the mshmt and  xxxg2068xxx  isozymes, it seems likely
that the plp-dependent enzymes involved in transsulfuration and one-carbon metabolism exhibit comparable aﬃnities for plp.
