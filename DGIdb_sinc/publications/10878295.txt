abstract
 xxxd2450xxx , the newest disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ždmard. for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis žra.,
acts by inhibiting  xxxg633xxx , the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway for pyrimidine production. the
drug thus limits t-cell proliferation, a process thought to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ra. in placebo-controlled
trials,  xxxd2450xxx  was superior to placebo and comparable to  xxxd3255xxx  and methotrexate for improving the signs and
symptoms of ra; and superior to placebo,  xxxd3255xxx , and methotrexate for improving health-related quality of life. in the
same trials,  xxxd2450xxx  was also superior to methotrexate and comparable to  xxxd3255xxx  for slowing radiographically
assessed progression of ra. when used in combination therapy in an open-label trial,  xxxd2450xxx  resulted in improvement
for over half of a group of ra patients who had failed to respond to methotrexate alone. the most common adverse events
associated with  xxxd2450xxx  treatment were gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions, alopecia, and elevated liver
enzyme levels. adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. clinical trial
results indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  is an efficacious and safe addition to the roster of therapeutic agents used to treat ra.

et al., 1998.. since mitogen-stimulated proliferation
of cd4q t-cells requires an expansion of the pyrimidine nucleotide pool within lymphocytes by 8- to
16-fold to support synthesis of new dna žfairbanks
et al., 1995., disruption of pyrimidine synthesis inhibits t-cell proliferation, a process thought to be a
key step in the pathogenesis of ra, by preventing
generation of sufficient pyrimidine for the
metabolism of new dna.
a77 1726 may also have a selective effect on
lymphocyte populations involved in the pathogenesis
of ra. lymphocytes treated in vitro with a77 1726
and then stimulated, arrest in the g1 phase of the cell
cycle žcherwinski et al., 1995b. when proto-oncogene proteins that serve as sensors of dna damage
prevent cells from entering the s phase of the cell
cycle during which dna is replicated. autoimmune
lymphocytes may be more susceptible to cell-cycle
arrest during  xxxd2450xxx  treatment because their
rapid division rate enhances the possibility of dna
damage in the face of reduced pyrimidine levels.
such damage would be sensed and would result in
cessation of antigen-driven cell proliferation žfox,
1998..

2. actions of  xxxd2450xxx  in animal models of ra
the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  has been tested in
several animal models of ra or in ra-like conditions. the model most commonly used, adjuvant-induced arthritis žaia. in rats, is produced by sensitizing animals with subdermal injections of adjuvant. in
this model, arthritis develops within 2 weeks and is
characterized by reduced body weight, paw edema,
and the development of inflammatory lesions. when
given within 2 weeks of adjuvant injection, oral
 xxxd2450xxx  inhibited the dermal hypersensitivity that
characterized the initial stages of aia development
žhambleton and mcmahon, 1990..  xxxd2450xxx  also
limited or prevented the subsequent development of
full-blown arthritis as evidenced by significantly reduced paw edema and decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate žesr. žbartlett and schleyerbach,
1985; pasternak et al., 1987..
in a closely related model of aia,  xxxd2450xxx 
treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of
joint swelling induced by injection of bovine serum

albumin into the knee joint of previously sensitized
rats. in animals treated with oral  xxxd2450xxx  ž5 or
10 mgrkg., the reduction in knee swelling was
significantly greater than that following intraperitoneal injection of 5 mgrkg cyclosporine.  xxxd2450xxx  ž10 mgrkg. also resulted in the greatest reduction in the concentration of circulating matrix component antibodies žthoss et al., 1996., a parameter
that correlates closely with the severity of arthritis in
this model.
 xxxd2450xxx  has also been shown to be effective
in a mouse model of proteoglycan-induced progressive polyarthritis. in this model, genetically susceptible balbrc mice express both cell-mediated and
humoral immunity in response to intraperitoneal injections of cartilage proteoglycans suspended in adjuvant. treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  ž35 mgrkgrday.
reduced both the acute inflammation and the cartilage damage seen in control proteoglycan-injected
animals that did not receive  xxxd2450xxx . the decreased inflammation and joint damage was associated with a reduction in titers of antibodies directed
against both the injected proteoglycans and autoantibodies to murine proteoglycans. this observation led
the authors to speculate that the improvement of
arthritis symptoms seen with  xxxd2450xxx  was due
primarily to the ability of the drug to suppress
production of autoreactive antibodies žglant et al.,
1992, 1994..

3. efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  in ra patients
3.1. phase ii dose-finding trial of  xxxd2450xxx 
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  was initially
assessed in a phase ii dose-finding clinical trial. in
this randomized, double-blind study, 402 patients
with active ra as defined by american college of
rheumatology žacr. criteria žarnett et al., 1988.
were treated with a loading dose of  xxxd2450xxx  of
50 mg followed by 5 mgrday, a loading dose of 100
mg followed by a dose of 10 or 25 mgrday, or
placebo žmladenovic et al., 1995.. treatment was
continued for 24 weeks. stable doses of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs žnsaids. and prednisone
žf 10 mg. were permitted during the trial. a washout

period of at least 3 months from prior dmard
therapy was required.
the primary efficacy variables in this study were
tender žtjc. and swollen joint count žsjc., based on
68 joints, and physician and patient global assessment of disease. treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  significantly improved all primary efficacy variables in a
dose-dependent manner žtable 1.. the number of
positive clinical responses defined by acr criteria
žfelson et al., 1993. was also determined. by acr
criteria, a responder is defined as a patient who has a
g 20% improvement in both tjc and sjc and in at
least three of the following five criteria: patient
global assessment, physician global assessment, pain
intensity, health assessment questionnaire žhaq., or
esr. the number of patients with acr 20% response increased in a dose-dependent manner during
treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  and the number of responders among the patients treated with 10 and 25
mgrday  xxxd2450xxx  was significantly higher than in
the placebo group.
the response in terms of a number of secondary
efficacy variables including haq score, pain assessment, morning stiffness, and esr was also determined during treatment with the different doses of
 xxxd2450xxx . all variables were significantly improved compared to placebo during treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  at doses of 10 and 25 mg with the
exception of morning stiffness, which was significantly improved only with 25 mg  xxxd2450xxx . in a
subsequent population pharmacokinetic model analysis of dose-finding data, a dose of 20 mg of  xxxd2450xxx  daily was shown to result in maximum probability of clinical success žweber and harnisch, 1997..
based on this finding, 20 mg of  xxxd2450xxx  daily
was chosen as the standard dose.

293

3.2. phase iii trials of  xxxd2450xxx 
a multinational, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that compared the efficacy of
 xxxd2450xxx  to that of  xxxd3255xxx  in 358 patients
with active ra has recently been reported žsmolen
et al., 1999a.. in this study, patients receiving
 xxxd2450xxx  were given a loading dose of 100 mgr
day on days 1–3 and 20 mgrday for the remainder
of the 24-week study period.  xxxd3255xxx  was
titrated to 2 grday over the first 4 weeks of the
study and maintained at this level in most patients
for the remainder of the trial period. the primary
efficacy variables of the study were tjc and sjc
and the patient’s and physician’s overall assessment
of disease activity. radiographs of wrists and feet
were taken prior to and following the treatment
period and used to assess the degree of joint space
narrowing and bone erosion in 40 joints. differences
in before and after scores were used as an index of
ra disease progression.
changes in tjc, sjc, and patient and physician
global assessments after 24 weeks of treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  or  xxxd3255xxx  are shown in fig. 1.
treatment with both drugs resulted in significant and
statistically equivalent improvements in all primary
efficacy variables. the percentage of patients meeting the criteria for acr 20% response was 29% for
placebo, 55% for  xxxd2450xxx  ž p - 0.0001 vs.
placebo., and 57% for  xxxd3255xxx  ž p - 0.0001 vs.
placebo.. significant improvement in all clinical outcome measures occurred sooner with  xxxd2450xxx 
than with placebo or  xxxd3255xxx . as early as 4
weeks after the initiation of treatment, the improvement of primary efficacy variables seen with  xxxd2450xxx  was significantly greater than that seen with

assessment of functional ability by haq analysis
after 24 weeks of treatment also indicated that
 xxxd2450xxx  was significantly better than placebo or
 xxxd3255xxx  for improving the health-related quality
of life of patients based on their ability to perform
physical activities že.g., dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and selfmaintenance..
comparison of radiographs taken before and after
24 weeks of treatment indicated that patients treated
with both  xxxd2450xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx  showed significantly less disease progression than placebotreated patients. changes in eroded joint count were
similar in the  xxxd2450xxx - and  xxxd3255xxx -treated
groups and were significantly lower than the changes
observed in patients receiving placebo. slower disease progression compared with placebo was noted
in subscores for hands and feet in both active treatment groups žsmolen et al., 1999a..

patients who completed 24 weeks of therapy with
 xxxd2450xxx  or  xxxd3255xxx  were allowed to continue treatment for an additional 24 weeks. patients
receiving placebo during the initial treatment period
were switched to  xxxd3255xxx  for the additional 24
weeks. preliminary results from this continuation
study indicated that patients treated with both
 xxxd2450xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx  maintained the improvement in tjc and sjc noted during the initial
24 weeks of treatment žsmolen et al., 1999b.. additionally, radiographs taken after 48 weeks demonstrated continued slowing of disease progression with
both  xxxd2450xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx  žlarsen et al.,
1999a,b.. further improvement in functional ability
was also noted in the patients who received an
additional 24 weeks of  xxxd2450xxx  treatment žkalden

lated quality of life. treatment with either agent
significantly improved quality of life relative to
placebo žstrand et al., 1999.. although both  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate significantly retarded the progression of radiographically assessed ra compared
to placebo, the degree of progression was significantly less with  xxxd2450xxx  than with methotrexate
žstrand et al., 1999..
the second comparison of  xxxd2450xxx  and
methotrexate was a phase iii, multinational, doubleblind, randomized trial conducted primarily in europe. in this trial, ra patients received either
 xxxd2450xxx  ž100 mgrday for 3 days followed by 20
mgrday; n s 495. or methotrexate ž10 mgrweek by
week 5 with optional increase to 15 mgrweek after
week 12; n s 489.. folate supplementation was not
mandated in this study, which continued for 52
weeks.
the acr 20% response rate with  xxxd2450xxx 
treatment in the european study was very similar to
that seen in the american trial ž51% vs. 52%.. in
contrast, the response rate during methotrexate treatment in the european study was markedly higher
than during the american trial ž65% vs. 46%.. the
acr 20% response rate during methotrexate treatment in the european study was significantly higher
than the response rate during  xxxd2450xxx  treatment,
while both  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate produced
equivalent response rates in the american study
žemery et al., 1999.. in spite of the difference in
acr response rates, the overall response to treatment during the study, as indicated by auc analysis,
was equivalent for  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate in
both trials žemery et al., 1999.. radiographic assessment of disease progression based on x-rays taken
before and after drug treatment also indicated a
similar degree of disease progression in patients
receiving  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate žlarsen et
al., 1999a,b.. differences in the use of supplemental
folate, mandated in the us study only, and in the
average disease duration of patients enrolled in the
two trials žf 4 years in the european study vs. g 7
years in the american trial. may have contributed to
the efficacy of methotrexate observed in the two
trials.
in summary, the results of phase iii clinical trials
have shown  xxxd2450xxx  to be an effective treatment
for ra. in all placebo-controlled trials,  xxxd2450xxx

was superior to placebo in improving the signs and
symptoms of ra.  xxxd2450xxx  was comparable to
 xxxd3255xxx  and methotrexate in terms of response
rate and overall improvement of the signs and symptoms of ra in placebo-controlled trials and was
superior to placebo and  xxxd3255xxx  and equivalent
to methotrexate for improving health-related quality
of life. in placebo-controlled trials,  xxxd2450xxx  was
also shown to be comparable to  xxxd3255xxx  and
superior to methotrexate for reducing radiographically assessed progression of ra.
3.3. safety in phase iii clinical trials of  xxxd2450xxx 
the overall incidence of serious drug-related adverse events žsaes. and the incidence of withdrawals due to aes during all clinical trials of
 xxxd2450xxx  are shown in table 3. the withdrawal
rate of patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx  was higher
than in patients receiving placebo, but comparable to
the withdrawal rates in patients treated with  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate. the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd2450xxx  were diarrhea, nausea, allergic reactions, and alopecia
žmladenovic et al., 1995; smolen et al., 1999a,b..
most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without further complications.
the elevations of plasma liver enzyme levels in

placebo, respectively.

sulted from the fact that folate supplementation was
not mandated. changes in aspartate aminotransferase
žsgot., the other major liver enzyme that was
monitored during the clinical trials, tended to parallel
the changes in sgpt. most clinically significant
elevations of liver enzymes with  xxxd2450xxx  treatment were asymptomatic and reversible with dose
reduction or discontinuation of  xxxd2450xxx  treatment.
among the patients treated with methotrexate in
phase iii clinical trials, five cases of potentially fatal
interstitial pneumonitis were noted, vs. no cases in
patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx . similarly, two
cases of agranulocytosis requiring hospitalization
were noted in patients receiving  xxxd3255xxx , a side
effect that was not seen during treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx .
3.4. combination therapy with  xxxd2450xxx 
given the high failure rate of ra monotherapy,
there has been an increasing interest in combining
antirheumatic drugs that act at different sites in the
pathological cascade of ra in the hope of attaining
greater andror more prolonged efficacy with no
increase in adverse events žharris, 1996.. a preliminary open-label trial testing the efficacy, safety, and
potential drug interaction of the combination of
 xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate has recently been published žweinblatt et al., 1999..

m. schattenkirchnerr immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 291–298

this open-label 52-week study was conducted in
30 adult patients with active ra despite treatment
with an average of 17 mgrweek of methotrexate for
6 months.  xxxd2450xxx  was added to methotrexate in
a loading dose of 100 mg for the first 2 days.
thereafter, the dose of  xxxd2450xxx  was 10 mgrday.
this could be increased to 20 mgrday in patients
who still had active disease after 3 months. stable
doses of prednisone žf 10 mgrday. and nsaids
were allowed for all patients.
of the 30 subjects in the study, 23 completed the
full 52 weeks of treatment. three subjects withdrew
from the study because of adverse events and two
because of lack of efficacy. sixteen patients ž53%.
met the criteria for acr 20% response during the
course of the trial. additionally, two subjects met
acr criteria for remission of ra žpinals et al.,
1981.. periodic measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate and a77 1726, the active
metabolite of  xxxd2450xxx , demonstrated minimal
changes in these variables over the course of treatment, an indication of lack of significant drug interaction.
combination therapy was generally well tolerated.
the most common adverse events were elevation of
liver enzyme levels, respiratory infections, diarrhea,
alopecia, cough, and nausea. of the 155 adverse
events seen during the study, 98% were rated as mild
to moderate in severity by the investigator. three
subjects were withdrawn from the study as mandated
by protocol because of persistent elevation of liver
enzyme levels. in all three cases, elevations of liver
enzymes resolved upon discontinuation of therapy.
based on the findings of this small pilot combination therapy study, the authors concluded that the
combination of methotrexate and  xxxd2450xxx  may
be useful for the treatment of ra žweinblatt et al.,
1999.. a randomized trial to verify the findings of
the study is currently in progress.

4. discussion
 xxxd2450xxx , the newest dmard, has been
shown to be an effective treatment for ra in a
number of clinical trials. in placebo-controlled trials,
 xxxd2450xxx  was superior to placebo and comparable
to  xxxd3255xxx  and methotrexate for improving the

297

signs and symptoms of ra and superior to placebo,
 xxxd3255xxx , and methotrexate for improving
health-related quality of life. in placebo-controlled
trials,  xxxd2450xxx  was also superior to methotrexate
and comparable to  xxxd3255xxx  for slowing radiographically assessed progression of ra. when used
in combination therapy,  xxxd2450xxx  resulted in improvement for over half of a group of ra patients
who had failed to respond to methotrexate alone.
the most common adverse events associated with
 xxxd2450xxx  treatment include gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions, alopecia, and elevated liver
enzyme levels. adverse events were generally mild
to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae.
the results of the phase iii clinical trials indicate
that  xxxd2450xxx  is an efficacious and safe addition
to the roster of therapeutic agents used to treat ra.
the finding that  xxxd2450xxx  slows radiographically
assessed disease progression of ra in placebo-controlled trials is particularly interesting and has led the
food and drug administration to approve  xxxd2450xxx  with an indication for retarding the structural
damage of ra.  xxxd2450xxx  is the first dmard to
receive such an indication.
