a b s t r a c t human  xxxg752xxx  ( xxxg752xxx ) is
a single-chain plasma glycoprotein (mol wt 57,000) that
participates in the middle phase of the intrinsic
pathway of blood coagulation. it is present in plasma as
a zymogen and is converted to a  xxxg745xxx , factor
ixao, by factor xia (activated plasma thromboplastin
antecedent) in the presence of calcium ions. in the
activation reaction, two internal peptide bonds are
hydrolyzed in  xxxg752xxx . these cleavages occur at a
specific arginyl-alanine peptide bond and a specific
arginyl-valine peptide bond. this results in the release
of an activation peptide (mol wt- 11,000) from the
internal region of the precursor molecule and the
generation of factor ixao (mol wt -46,000). factor
ixa, is composed of a light chain (mol wt -18,000) and a
heavy chain (mol wt -28,000), and these chains are
held together by a disulfide bond(s). the light chain
originates from the amino terminal portion of the
precursor molecule and has an amino terminal
sequence of tyr-asn-ser-gly-lys. the heavy chain
originates from the carboxyl terminal region of the
precursor molecule and contains an amino terminal
sequence of val-val-gly-gly-glu. the heavy chain of
factor ixa, also contains the active site sequence of
phe-cys-ala-gly-phe-his-glu-gly -gly -arg -asp -ser cys-gln-gly-asp-ser-gly-gly-pro. the active site
serine residue is shown in capital letters.  xxxg752xxx  is
also converted to factor ixa,,: by a protease from
russell's viper venom. this activation reaction,
however, occurs in a single step and involves only the
cleavage of the internal arginyl-valine peptide bond.
human  xxxg752xxx ,,3 was inhibited by human  xxxg2056xxx  by the formation of a one-to-one
complex of enzyme and inhibitor. in this reaction, the
inhibitor was tightly bound to the heavy chain of the
enzyme. these data indicate that the mechanism of
activation of human  xxxg752xxx  and its inhibition by
 xxxg2056xxx  is essentially identical to that
previously shown for bovine  xxxg752xxx .

introduction

human  xxxg752xxx  ( xxxg752xxx )' is one of'the three
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent plasma proteins that participate
in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (1). during the generation of' fibrin,  xxxg752xxx , a zymogen, is
converted to a  xxxg745xxx  called factor ixa. in
the presence of  xxxg751xxx  (activated antihemophilic
factor), phospholipid, and calcium ions, factor ixa then
converts  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ) to  xxxg741xxx .
the purification of human  xxxg752xxx  has been reported by a number of different investigators (2-7). it
is a single-chain glycoprotein with mol wt 57,000.
human  xxxg752xxx , as well as bovine  xxxg752xxx , also
contains y-carboxyglutamic acid which is characteristic
of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins (8, 9).
the activation of bovine  xxxg752xxx  by bovine factor
xia (activated  xxxg742xxx ) occurs in two steps (10, 11). in the first step, a specific
internal peptide bond is cleaved giving rise to a twochain intermediate held together by a disulfide bond(s).
this intermediate does not have enzymatic activity. in
the next step, a second specific peptide bond in the
amino terminal region of the heavy chain is cleaved
giving rise to factor ixa5s and an activation peptide.
bovine  xxxg752xxx  is also activated by a protease
from russell's viper venom (rvv-x)2 in a single-step
reaction (11). in this reaction,  xxxg752xxx  is activated
by the cleavage of an internal arginyl-valine bond
generating factor ixaa. (11). recently, osterud and
rapaport (12) have reported the activation of human
 xxxg752xxx  by  xxxg750xxx  and thromboplastin. the details of this activation mechanism, however, have not
been defined thus far.
studies by a number of' investigators have shown
' the nomenclature for the various clotting factors is that
recommended by an international nomenclature committee
(13). the nomenclature for activated  xxxg752xxx  is that of lind(1uist et al. (11).

rvv-x- and trypsin-sepharose were prepared by incubating
20 mig of rvv-x or trypsin in 20 ml of 0.1 m sodium
bicarbonate containiing 1.0 m nacl overnight with 20( ml of a
sepharose 4b slurry previously activated with eyanogen
bromide (17).
humiian factor xia was prepared from a honmogeneous
preparation of factor xi (18) as follows: factor xi (80 tg)
in 100 ,ul 50 mmi tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.8 containing 0.15 ni
nacl was added to 25 ,l of trypsin-sepharose previously
e(luilibrated vith the same buffer. the reaction mixture
was incubated for 25 min at 300c with rapid swirling.
the trypsin-sepharose was then removed by centrifugation for
1 min at 50() g and the factor xia was used immediately
to activate  xxxg752xxx .
protein concentratioin was determined by absorption at 280
nm. an extinctioni coefficient of e.-i = 13.3 was employed
for  xxxg752xxx  (7), and this same value was assumed for

factor ixa. an e"", = 5.7 was employed for human anti= 13.4 was assumed for human
thrombin iii (216),
and an
factor xia (18).
amino acid and carbohydrate analyses and preparation of
samples were carried out by the methods described (19-28).
sodium dodecyl sulf;ate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
was performed by the method of weber and osborn (29) as
modified by kisiel et al. (15). the gels were run for 3-4 h at 4.2
ma/gel and were stained for protein with a 0.2% solution of
coomassie brilliant blue. the gel containing the activation
peptide was first fixed in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h
before staining. molecular weights were estimated by
interpolation from a linear semilogarithmic plot of molecular
weight vs. migration distance with the following protein
standards: phosphorylase b (97,000), bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(68,000), aldolase (40,000), bovine carbonic anhydrase
(29,000), and myoglobin (17,000).
activation of  xxxg752xxx  by factor xia and rvv-x sepharose.
human  xxxg752xxx  (10 mg) in 10 ml of 0.05 m tris-hcl buffer,
ph 7.8, containing 0.15 m nacl and 5 mm cacl2 was activated
at 37°c by the addition of 0.13 mg factor xia. the enzyme-tosubstrate weight ratio varied from 1:50 to 1:80. the reaction
was terminated by the addition of edta to a final
concentration of 10 mm. for coagulant assays, samples (10 ,ul)
were withdrawn at various times from the reaction mixture and
diluted 100- to 1,000-fold with cold michaelis buffer (36 mm
sodium acetate, 36 mm sodium  xxxd285xxx , and 0.145 m sodium
chloride, ph 7.4) containing bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.1
mg/ml). an aliquot (0.1 ml) of the diluted sample was then
incubated at 37°c for 1 min with 0.1 ml of 0.08% inosithin
suspension and 0.1 ml of normal human plasma in a siliconized
glass tube. the clotting time was determined after the addition
of 0.1 ml of 0.033 m cacl2. the percent activation of  xxxg752xxx 
was determined from a calibration curve prepared from the
folly activated sample.
 xxxg752xxx  (0.056 mg) in 0.07 ml of 0.05 m tris-hcl buffer,
ph 7.8, containing 0.15 m nacl and 10 mm cacl2 was
activated by the addition of 20 ul of rvv-x sepharose
suspension f'ollowed by rapid swirling throughout the incubation at 37°c. at various times, the reaction was terminated by
the addition of 10 ,ul of' 0.2 m edta and the tube was
centrif'uged for 1 min at 500 g to remove the rvv-x-sepharose.
factor ixa in the supernatant fraction was then assayed as
described above.
the effect of dfp on factor ixa0 was tested by incubating
freshly prepared factor ixao in 0.05 m tris-hcl buffer, ph
7.8, containing 0.15 m nacl and 5 mm cacl2 with 1 mm to 5
mm dfp f'or 1 h at 37°c. esterase assays for human factor
ixa were carried out by the method of roffman et al. (30) as
described by kurachi et al. (31) using l[3h]tosyl arginine
methyl ester as a substrate.
the heavy and light chains of' human factor ixa and the
activation peptide were prepared as follows:  xxxg752xxx  (10 mg)
was incubated with factor xia (0.15 mg) for 75 min in the
presence of 5 mm calcium chloride as previously described
and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of
0.2 m edta. the protein was then desalted on a sephadex g25 column (2 x 40 cm) which had previously been e(quilibrated
with 1%  xxxd2154xxx . the protein was eluted with 1% formic
acid and the fractions containing the protein were pooled and
lyophilized. it was then dissolved in 1 ml of 1%  xxxd2154xxx  and
6 m urea and applied to a sephadex g-75 column (1.6 x 84 cm)
which had previously been e(quilibrated with 1%  xxxd2154xxx 
and 6.0 m urea. the flow rate was 0.1 ml/min. the peaks
containing the activation peptide and factor ixa were pooled
separately and lyophilized. factor ixa was then reduced and
carboxymethylated or pyridylethylated by the methods of
crestfield et al. (23) or friedman et al. (24). the heavy and

human  xxxg752xxx 

1529

light chains were applied to a sephadex g-50 superfine
column (1.6 x 85 cm) which had previously been equilibrated
with 1%  xxxd2154xxx  and 6.0 m urea, and the column was
eluted with the same solution. the flow rate was 0.2 ml/min.
the peak containing the heavy chain was desalted on a
sephadex g-25 column (2 x 40 cm) in 10%  xxxd2154xxx  and
lyophilized. the peak containing the light chain was also
desalted, lyophilized, and then redissolved in 6 m urea and
1%  xxxd2154xxx . it was then subjected to gel filtration on a
second sephadex g-50 column under the same conditions to
free it from small amounts of contaminating heavy chain. after
the second passage over the sephadex g-50 column, the pure
light chain was desalted and lyophilized.
the digestion of the heavy chain of factor ixa by cyanogen
bromide was performed by dissolving 9 mg of salt-free spyridylethyl factor ixa heavy chain in 1.5 ml of 70% formic
acid. cyanogen bromide (45 mg) was then added and the
reaction was allowed to proceed for 36 h at 4°c. after
lyophilization, the digest was fractionated by gel filtration on a
sephadex g-50 superfine column (2.6 x 95 cm) in 10% formic
acid at a flow rate of 0.30 ml/min.
amino terminal sequence analyses were performed with a
beckman sequenator model 890c (beckman instruments,
inc., fullerton, calif.) described (32-34). for amino terminal
analyses, the approximate amounts of samples that were used
were 1.0 mg of the activation peptide, 1.5 mg of the scarboxymethyl light chain of factor ixa, 0.9 mg of the spyridylethyl cyanogen bromide peptide containing the active
site of factor ixa, 1.5 mg of the s-pyridylethyl heavy chain of
factor ixa, and 0.8 mg of the third cyanogen bromide fragment
from the digest of the heavy chain of factor ixa. all analyses
were performed twice. in the quantitation of the amino
terminal residues, protein concentration was determined by
amino acid analysis after hydrolysis of the sample in 6 n hci.
 xxxd2755xxx  was employed as the internal standard to calculate
protein recovery.
carboxyl terminal analysis was carried out by a modification
of the procedure of fraenkel-conrat et al. (35). pancreatic
carboxypeptidases a and b were treated with 1 mm dfp
before use. the activation peptide (-0.5 mg) and the scarboxymethylated light chain (_ 1.0 mg) were dissolved in 0.2
ml and 0.5 ml, respectively, of 0.01 nm sodium phosphate
buffer, ph 8.0, containing 1.0% sodium  xxxd3215xxx . the
samples were boiled for 10 min and diluted by the addition of
0.25 ml or 0.5 ml of 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0,
for the activation peptide and the s-carboxymethylated light
chain, respectively. half of the sample was incubated for 16 h
at 37°c with carboxypeptidase a and the other half with
 xxxg502xxx  employing an enzyme-to-substrate weight
ratio of 1:50. the liberated amino acids were then analyzed in
the amino acid analyzer. the amount of the peptides was
quantitated by amino acid analysis of a 24-h hydrolysate
employing  xxxd2755xxx  as an internal standard.
antibodies against human  xxxg752xxx  were prepared from
rabbits which had been injected subcutaneously three times
with 0.5-0.7 mg of purified human  xxxg752xxx  with freund's
complete or incomplete adjuvant. the animals wvere bled by
heart puncture and the antibodies were purified as described
by fujikawa et al. (36). immunoelectrophoresis was performed on glass slides (2.5 x 7.5 cm) with 1% agarose in
0.05 m sodium  xxxd285xxx  buffer, ph 8.6, containing 0.01%
sodium azide according to the method of scheidegger (37).
samples (4-7 gg) were subjected to electrophoresis for 50
min at 150 v at 4°c and 50 ,li of antibody solution (2.0
mg/ml) was added to the trough and allowed to diffuse
through the agarose gel overnight.

incubating human  xxxg2056xxx  (0.3 mg) with factor ixa.,
(0.12 mg) in 1 ml of 0.02 m imidazole-hcl buffer, ph 7.4,
containing 0.15 m nacl in the presence or absence of heparin
(10 u). samples were incubated at 37°c and 10-,ul aliquots
were withdrawn at various times, diluted with ice-cold
michaelis buffer, and assayed immediately for coagulant
activity as previously described. the inhibition of factor
ixai3 was also studied as a function of  xxxg2056xxx 
concentration. in these experiments, 10 um of factor ixa
in 0.2 ml of 0.05 m tris-hci buffer, ph 7.8, containing 0.15
m nacl, in the presence or absence of 10 u/ml of heparin,
was incubated with increasing concentrations of antithrombin
iii at 37°c for 15 min (in the presence of heparin) or 2 h
(in the absence of heparin). the residual factor ixa,9
activity was then assayed for coagulant and esterase activity
as previously described.

figure i time-course for the activation of human  xxxg752xxx 
by human factor xia and by rvv-x. the activation by factor
xia was performed by adding factor xia (0.015 mg) to a
reaction mixture containing 1.2 mg of human  xxxg752xxx  in 1.2
ml of 0.05 m tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.8), 0.15 m nacl and 5 mm
cacl2. at the appropriate time intervals, aliquots (5 ml) were
withdrawn and assayed for coagulant activity as described in
methods. the activation of  xxxg752xxx  by rvv-x was performed
by the addition of 0.02 ml of' rvv-x-sepharose to each of' a
series of small plastic centrif'uge tubes containing human
 xxxg752xxx  (0.8 mg/ml) in 0.07 ml of 0.05 m tris-hci buffer (ph

7.8), 0.15 m nacl, and 10 mm cacl2. after incubation f'or
various times, the reactions were terminated by the addition of
0.01 ml of 0.2 m edta. activated  xxxg752xxx  was separated
f'rom the rvv-x-sepharose by brief centrifugation, and factor
ixa coagulant activity was then assayed as described in
methods. (0),  xxxg752xxx  plus factor xia in the presence of
cacl2; (a),  xxxg752xxx  plus factor xia in the absence of
cac12; (0),  xxxg752xxx  plus rvv-x in the presence of cacl2;
(a),  xxxg752xxx  plus rvv-x in the absence of cacl2.

ixa also had esterase activity and hydrolyzed 0.33
,lmol of l[3h]tosyl arginine methyl ester per hour per
milligram of enzyme at room temperature. the stubstrate concentration was 0.16 mnm.
a difference in electrophoretic properties of factor
ix and factor ixat3 was apparent when the two proteins were examined by immunoelectrophoresis (fig.
2). factox ix (sample 1) had a faster electrophoretic
mobility than factor ixag3 (sample 2). both proteins
formed single, sharp precipitin lines.
a change in  xxxg752xxx  during the activation by
factor xia was also observed by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (fig. 3). in
these experiments, aliquots were removed at various
times from an activation reaction corresponding to
those shown in fig. 1 and analyzed by gel electrophoresis before reduction (upper panel) and after reduction
(lower panel). at zero time,  xxxg752xxx  (=mol wt
57,000) appeared as a single-chain species (upper
panel). a new faster-moving band (_mol wt 46,000)
was observed during the activation reaction and the
appearance of this band occurred in parallel with the
increase in coagulant activity. in reduced gels (lower
panel), three new bands were observed. the fastest
band (-mol wt 18,000) stained rather poorly and corresponded to the light chain of factor ixao. the second
fastest band (-mol wt 28,000) stained strongly and
corresponded to the heavy chain of factor ixao.
the appearance of this band occurred in parallel with
the increase of coagulant activity. the third fastest
band (-mol wt 45,000) appeared within the first 5 min
of the reaction and remained fairly constant during
the next 40 min. this band then disappeared as the
reaction went to completion. these data suggest that
human  xxxg752xxx  is activated via a twvo-step mechanism
analogous to that of bovine  xxxg752xxx . in this latter
reaction, a two-chain intermediate is initially formed.
this intermediate lacks enzymatic activity and con-

tains a heavy chain and a light chain held together
by a disulfide bond(s). in a second step, an activation
peptide is split from the amino terminal end of the
heavy chain of the intermediate giving rise to factor
ixao and an activation peptide. this reduces the
molecular weight of the precursor by -11,000. the
data shown in fig. 3 suggest that the mechanism
of activation of human  xxxg752xxx  is essentially identical
to that of bovine  xxxg752xxx . proof of this mechanism
for the human protein, however, required the isolation
and characterization of the various polypeptide chains.

factor ixao and the activation peptide.  xxxg752xxx  (10
mg) was activated in the presentce of factor xia
for 120 min under conditions similar to those shown
in fig. 1. the reaction mixture was then fractionated
on a sephadex g-75 superfine column in 6.0 m urea
containing 1%  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 4, left panel). the

amino terminal analyses. to identify the origin of
the chains of factor ixao and the bonds cleaved
during the activation reaction, it was necessary to
examine the amino terminal sequences of the heavy
0p
and light chains of factor ixa and the activation
peptide. the amino terminal sequences and the equivalents at each cycle for these various polypeptides
are shown in table i. amino acids that are underlined
are identical to those found in bovine  xxxg752xxx  (38).
the amino terminal sequence of the light chain was
found to be tyr-asn-ser-gly-lys-leu. this sequence
is identical to that found in the precursor molecule
(7). these data indicate that the amino terminal portion of  xxxg752xxx  gives rise to the light chain of

released from the light chain of factor ixa, after
incubation with  xxxg502xxx  for 16 h at 37°c in
0.05% sodium  xxxd3215xxx . no other amino acids
were found. under these same conditions, arginine
(0.7 equivalents) was released from the activationi peptide by  xxxg502xxx . no other amino acids were
found. furthermore, no amino acids were released
from either polypeptide by carboxypeptidase a. these
data indicate that arginine is the carboxyl terminal
amino acid of the activation peptide as well as the
light chain of factor ixa,. these experiments also
indicate that a specific arginyl-alanine peptide bond
and a specific arginyl-valine peptide bond are cleaved
in  xxxg752xxx  during the conversion of the precursor
to factor ixaa.
amino acid sequience of the active site. to
determine the amino acid sequeince in the active site
region of human  xxxg752xxx , the s-pyridylethyl heavy
chain of factor ixa,, (9 mg) was subjected to eyanogen
bromide digestion as described in methods. the
cyanogen bromide fragments were then fractionated on
a sephadex g-50 superfine column (2.5 x 95 cm) in
10%  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 5).three major peaks were
observed, which is consistent with the presence of' two
methionine residues in the heavy chain of the molecule
(table ii). the first peak showed a shoulder on the
leading edge of the peak, and this was found to be
because of residual undigested heavy chain. accordingly, the trailing edge of this peak and the remaining
two peaks were pooled separately and lyophilized. the
peptides recovered from peaks i, ii, and iii migrated as
single bands on sodium dodecyl sulf'ate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis with -mol wt 18,000, 5,000,
and 3,000, respectively. the amino terminal sequences

of the three peptides and the e(quivaleints at each cycle
are shown in table i. the residues that are underlined
are identical to residues from the corresponding region
in bovine  xxxg752xxx  (38). the first eyanogen bromide
fragment had an amino terminal sequence which was
the same as that of the heavy chain of human factor

ix,. the second cyanogen bromide fragment contained
the active site se(luence of factor ixa,. the active site
serine residue appeared in position 17 of this peptide.
the third cyanogen bromide fragment contained an
amino terminal lysine, and the sequeniee of this peptide
is homologous to a sequence in bovine factor ixaa
which is located in the carboxyl terminal region of' the
heavy chain of' the molecule (38).
effect of dfp and atntithrombin iii on human factor
ixa. the coagulant activity of  xxxg752xxx , was not
affected by incubation of the enzyme with 0.005 m
dfp for 60 min at 37°c at ph 7.8. factor ixao
was inhibited by  xxxg2056xxx , however, and the
rate of inactivation was extremely rapid in the presence
of heparin. similar results have been published for
human and bovine factor ixao (5, 31). the inhibition
of factor ixal as a function of  xxxg2056xxx  concentration also gave results that were essentially identical to the bovine system (31). in the presence or
absence of heparin, a one-to-one molar conmplex of enzyme and inhibitor was found at the inhibitor concentration giving maximal inhibition.
the formation of a stable one-to-one molar complex
between human factor ixao and  xxxg2056xxx  was
demonstrated by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (fig. 6). gels 1 and 4 show
 xxxg2056xxx  before and after reduction of'the disulfide bonds. gels 2 and 5 show factor ixao before and

activated  xxxg752xxx  formed in the reaction was called
factor ixaq. essentially, no activation of huiman factor
ix by rvv-x-sepharose occurred in the absence of
calcium (solid triangles). rvv-x-sepharose was employed in these experiments so that the clotting activity
of factor ixa could be readily followed after removal
of the rvv-x-sepharose by cenitrifugation. this was essential becatuse rvv-x readily activates  xxxg741xxx  and
this reaction will mask the effect of factor ixa in the
clotting assay. the exact concentration of rvv-x in the
reaction mixture was not determined. the enzyme-tosubstrate w,eight ratio w as probably -1:25, because unbound rvvi-x at this enzyme-to-substrate ratio gave the
