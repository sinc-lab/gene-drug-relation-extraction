phosphorus oxychloride (pocl3) is an intermediate in the synthesis of many organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve gases that are toxic to insects and mammals
by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity. it was therefore surprising to observe
that pocl3, which is hydrolytically unstable, also itself gives poisoning signs in ip-treated mice
and fumigant-exposed houseflies similar to those produced by the organophosphorus ester
insecticides and chemical warfare agents. in mice, pocl3 inhibits serum  xxxg248xxx 
(buche) at a sublethal dose and muscle but not brain ache at a lethal dose. in houseflies,
pocl3-induced brain ache inhibition is correlated with poisoning and the probable cause
thereof. pocl3 in vitro is selective for ache (ic50 ) 12-36 µm) compared with several other
serine hydrolases (buche, carboxylesterase, elastase, r-chymotrypsin, and thrombin) (ic50 )
88-2000 µm). with electric eel ache, methylcarbamoylation of the active site with  xxxd2940xxx 
reversibly protects against subsequent irreversible inhibition by pocl3. most importantly,
pocl3-induced electric eel ache inhibition prevents postlabeling with [3h]diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx ; i.e., both compounds phosphorylate at ser-200 in the catalytic triad. pyridine2-aldoxime methiodide does not reactivate pocl3-inhibited ache, consistent with an anionic
 xxxd1857xxx  residue at the esteratic site. the actual phosphorylating agent is formed within
seconds from pocl3 in water, has a half-life of ∼2 min, and is identified as phosphorodichloridic
acid [hop(o)cl2] by 31p nmr and derivatization with dimethylamine to hop(o)( xxxg1569xxx )2. pocl3
on reaction with water and hop(o)cl2 have the same potency for inhibition of ache from
either electric eel or housefly head as well as the same toxicity for mice. in summary, the
acute toxicity of pocl3 is attributable to hydrolytic activation to hop(o)cl2 that phosphorylates
ache at the active site to form enzymatically inactive [o- xxxd1857xxx ]ache.

introduction
the mechanism of toxicity of phosphorus oxychloride
(pocl3) is of both practical relevance and academic
interest. pocl3 is used in the synthesis of gasoline
additives, hydraulic fluids, fire retardants, and organophosphorus pesticides (1), leading to potential human
exposure. it is regarded by the environmental protection
agency as an extremely hazardous substance (1). pocl3
is intensely irritating to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, and inhalation may cause pulmonary edema. it
is a chlorinating agent and readily releases hcl on
exothermic reaction with water, yet the toxicity (at least
in lung) is not related to hcl release (2). pocl3 also
reacts directly with a variety of cellular components
ranging from serine in preparation of  xxxd1857xxx  (3)
to proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (4), casein, and
lysozyme (5). therefore, a potential alternative mechanism of toxicity, not previously considered, involves action
as a phosphorylating agent.

our investigation of pocl3 started with the unexpected
observation that its poisoning signs in both mice and
houseflies are similar to or the same as those produced
by triester phosphates that form dialkylphosphoryl derivatives of acetylcholinesterase (ache).1 this led to the
hypothesis that pocl3 is an anticholinesterase poison in
mammals and insects due to selective phosphorylation
of ache by pocl3 or a derivative thereof. although
dialkylphosphoryl-ache and its aged form (monoalkylphosphoryl-ache) are well-known (6, 7), the possible
formation of phospho-ache (phosphoryl-ache) would be
a novel poisoning mechanism.

phosphoacetylcholinesterase from pocl3
from aldrich chemical (milwaukee, wi), [1,3-3h]diisopropyl
 xxxd3217xxx  ([3h]dfp) (8.4 ci/mmol) from nen life
sciences products (boston, ma), dichlorvos (99% pure) (a
commercial insecticide) from chem service (west chester, pa),
and other chemicals, biochemicals, enzymes, and plasma from
sigma chemical (st. louis, mo) or aldrich. the preparation
and characterization of phosphorodichloridic acid [hop(o)cl2]
are described later.
toxicity and poisoning signs of pocl3. (1) mice. male
swiss-webster mice (ca. 30 g, charles river laboratories,
wilmington, ma) were treated ip with pocl3 and hop(o)cl2
(0-100 mg/kg) using corn oil as the carrier solvent (50 µl).
 xxxd1896xxx  is not an acceptable vehicle for pocl3
because it is unstable in this solvent, in which it undergoes a
rapid, exothermic reaction. poisoning signs were observed, and
mortality was recorded at 1 h (n ) 7-9 per dose).
(2) houseflies. adult female houseflies (musca domestica
l., scr strain, ca. 20 mg, 10-20 for each dose, 3-5 replicates)
were added to an all-glass cylinder (3.8 cm diameter × 10.7 cm;
120 ml volume). a 1 cm2 filter paper was treated (3-fold
difference in concentration) with pocl3 or dichlorvos (added
neat or in 5 µl of thf) and attached to a glass top used to close
the cylinder. the treated filter paper was separated from the
houseflies by 1 cm using a single layer of cheesecloth. after
exposure for 15 min at 25 °c, mortality was recorded and the
houseflies were frozen on dry ice and removed for ache activity
assays (below).
relationship between toxicity of pocl3 and in vivo
cholinesterase inhibition. (1) mice. tissue samples were
removed 1 or 24 h after treatment or at the time of death for
cholinesterase assays (n ) 3-5). blood was obtained by cardiac
puncture and serum recovered by centrifugation for the  xxxg248xxx  (buche) assay with butyrylthiocholine as
the substrate (9). brain, skeletal muscle (quadriceps), and
diaphragm were removed at death (100 mg/kg) or after 1 h (0
mg/kg) and homogenized (1% w/v for brain and 10% w/v for
quadriceps and diaphragm) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph
7.4) for an ache activity assay of 50-100 µl aliquots (10). for
diaphragm and quadriceps from control mice,  xxxd2940xxx  (10 µm)
inhibits 90 ( 3 and 69 ( 6% (n ) 3) of the apparent hydrolytic
activity for acetylthiocholine and this substrate is cleaved twice
as fast as butyrylthiocholine, indicating that most of the
observed hydrolysis is attributable to ache.
(2) houseflies. flies exposed to vapors of pocl3 or dichlorvos
for 15 min were frozen and subjected to brain ache activity
assays using heads cut from the frozen insects. ten heads per
concentration (3-5 replicates) were homogenized in 100 mm
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4, 625 µl), and 10 µl aliquots were
assayed for ache activity (11). the thf carrier (up to 5 µl
per assay chamber) did not affect the ache activity.
specificity of pocl3 for in vitro inhibition of cholinesterases and other serine hydrolases. ache from
electric eel (electrophorus electricus) (0.02 unit), bovine erythrocytes (0.04 unit), or fly head or mouse brain as described above
in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4, 500 µl) was
reacted for 15 min at 25 °c with pocl3 added in thf (5 µl).
acetylthiocholine hydrolysis rates were then determined (10).
similar inhibitor sensitivity assays were carried out with
buche (purified or blood plasma), carboxylesterase, elastase,
r-chymotrypsin, and thrombin as described previously except
here using thf as the carrier solvent for pocl3 and in the
control (9, 12). the inhibitory potency of pocl3 was also
compared with those of hop(o)cl2 and several other phosphorus derivatives in 15 min preincubation assays with electric eel
ache. four concentrations up to 2000 µm were used at 2-3fold dose differentials, giving 15-85% inhibition (n ) 3-4 per
concentration). the median inhibitory concentration (ic50)
values that are reported are means of at least two independent
experiments, and the relative se values are the average for the
two data points nearest the ic50 (n ) 4).
ache inhibition by pocl3 involves reaction at the
esteratic site. (1) protection by  xxxd2940xxx  and acetylcho-

chem. res. toxicol., vol. 13, no. 7, 2000 653
line. electric eel ache (0.2 unit) in 100 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4, 500 µl) was treated with  xxxd2940xxx  (0 or 5 µm final
concentration) added in the same phosphate buffer (10 µl) and
incubated for 30 min at 25 °c. pocl3 (220 µm final concentration) in thf (5 µl) or thf alone (control) was added with
incubation for 15 min at 25 °c. alternatively, acetylcholine
chloride (10 or 100 mm final concentration) was added just prior
to pocl3. ache was recovered by size-exclusion chromatography (10dg column packed with p-6dg gel, bio-rad, hercules,
ca) with all activity collected in a 1 ml fraction. aliquots (100
µl) were assayed for ache activity (10). reproducible recovery
of high levels of ache activity requires pretreatment of the
column with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.5 ml) and rinsing
with buffer (8 ml) before each run (column reused).
(2) inhibition of postlabeling by [3h]dfp. electric eel
ache (9.3 units) in 100 mm phosphate at ph 7.4 (500 µl) was
reacted with pocl3 (0, 11, 22, 73, and 220 µm final concentrations, n ) 3 each) or with carrier solvent alone as described
above. ache was radiolabeled with [3h]dfp (1 µci added in
10 µl of  xxxd3034xxx ) for 1 h at 25 °c, and then recovered
by size-exclusion chromatography for analysis of hydrolytic
activity (1% aliquot) and 3h content by liquid scintillation
counting. a larger-scale reaction was used to verify that the sizeexclusion chromatographic fraction contained [3h]dfp-labeled
ache. hence, ache (28 units) in phosphate buffer (330 µl)
was reacted with [3h]dfp (3 µci added in 30 µl of propylene
glycol) for 2.5 h at 25 °c. bovine  xxxg124xxx  (25 µg) was
added to the excluded protein fraction collected from the biorad 10dg column, and the sample was evaporated to dryness
(speed vac concentrator, savant, farmingdale, ny). half
(73 000 dpm) of the protein fraction was analyzed by sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sdspage) (11% polyacrylamide gel), stained with coomassie blue,
destained, and cut into 2 mm slices with a gel slicer (model de
113, hoefer scientific, san francisco, ca) for quantification of
3h by liquid scintillation counting.
rates of ache inhibition by pocl3 and subsequent
reactivation. to determine the rate of ache inhibition, the
electric eel assay as described above was varied by comparing
ache activity after incubation for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min with
pocl3 (22 µm). in a reactivation assay, electric eel ache was
inhibited with 220 µm pocl3 as described above. spontaneous
recovery of ache activity was assayed at 1-7 h. pyridine-2aldoxime methiodide (2-pam) (500 µm final concentration) was
added for possible chemically induced reactivation. potential
enzyme-enhanced recovery of ache activity utilized mouse liver
cytosol (10-50 µl from a 20% homogenate) and horse blood
plasma (20-50 µl), both previously treated for 30 min with
phenyl saligenin cyclic phosphonate at 100 µm to inhibit liver
esterases and plasma buche, respectively (12).
hydrolysis of pocl3 and stability of intermediates. (1)
synthesis of hop(o)cl2 [see also hudson and moss (13)].
a solution of water (6.6 mmol) in thf (10 ml) was added
dropwise to pocl3 (6.6 mmol) in dry thf (10 ml) with stirring
at -78 °c. the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 15 min. 31p nmr (121.5 mhz
with a bruker am-300 spectrometer) showed a single major
peak (delta -3.8 ppm relative to 85% phosphoric acid as the external
standard) corresponding to hop(o)cl2 (>95% pure) which was
confirmed by addition to excess dimethylamine in thf, giving
quantitative conversion to hop(o)( xxxg1569xxx )2 (delta 18.0 ppm). hop(o)cl2 is stable in thf. the corresponding pyrophosphate [cl2p(o)op(o)cl2] was also considered as a possible product, but it
is less likely to form under dilute conditions, gives a 31p nmr
chemical shift of delta -9.5 ppm, reacts with excess dimethylamine
to give (me2n)2p(o)op(o)( xxxg1569xxx )2 (delta 11.0 ppm), and is not stable
in a 2:1 water/thf mixture, hydrolyzing instantly to phosphate.
(2) pocl3 hydrolysis and reaction with serine. pocl3
(6 µl, 64 µmol) was added to 200 mm borate buffer (ph 7.4,
500 µl) and the mixture shaken (5 s), and then the reaction
progress was followed by 31p nmr. alternatively, the buffer
contained serine (100 mg, 950 µmol) or was replaced by water.

(3) hydrolysis rates in buffer (ph 7.4) for pocl3 and

estimation of hydrolysis rates. thus, pocl3 and hop(o)cl2 in
thf (5 µl) were added to 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4,
495 µl) (73 µm final concentration). after 0-9.5 min at 25 °c,
ache (0.02 unit) was added (10 µl of buffer) and residual ache
activity was determined following incubation for 15 min.
amounts of pocl3 and hop(o)cl2 were calculated from inhibition curves.

(20 ml) was added, and the water/thf (2:1) solution was
warmed to 25 °c. aliquots were removed simultaneously over
the course of 4 h for 31p nmr analysis (500 µl) and the electric
eel ache inhibition assay (5 µl of a 1:7 dilution with thf).

after treatment.
(2) houseflies. pocl3 is a vapor toxicant for houseflies
with a 15 min median lethal concentration (lc50) of ∼20

gives an lc50 of ∼0.1 mg/l. the poisoning signs are the
same for pocl3 and dichlorvos, proceeding from hyperactivity to paralysis typical of anticholinesterase poisons.

plete inhibition in houseflies dying from exposure to
pocl3 vapors (figure 2). the ic50 for pocl3 is 6 mg/l
versus 0.04 mg/l for dichlorvos, in each case with little

paralysis and death at g90% inhibition.
specificity of pocl3 for in vitro inhibition of
cholinesterases and other serine hydrolases. ache
is the most sensitive serine hydrolase tested. pocl3 is
about 3-fold more potent for housefly head ache (ic50
) 10-12 µm) than for ache from electric eel (ic50 ) 2533 µm) (figure 3), mouse brain, or bovine erythrocyte
(table 1). buche also is inhibited by pocl3 but less
potently and with considerable species variability. mouse
plasma buche is most sensitive (ic50 ) 88 µm), consistent with its utility as a biomarker for poisoning from
pocl3 in mice. carboxylesterase is inhibited at relatively
low levels of pocl3 (ic50 ) 140 µm), whereas other serine
hydrolases (elastase, r-chymotrypsin, and thrombin) are
less affected (ic50 > 1000 µm).
pocl3 and related compounds as in vitro inhibitors of ache. pocl3 and hop(o)cl2 (discussed
later) are equipotent inhibitors of electric eel and housefly
ache (figure 3) and are much more potent than other
phosphorus halides that were examined (table 2). two
trimethylsilyl (tms) esters,  xxxd2929xxx , and acetyl
phosphate were essentially inactive. these findings

the ache activity at 2 h compared to  xxxd2940xxx  alone.
likewise, ache activity was 13 ( 2% of the control for

and was unchanged at 100 mm (12 ( 2%) compared to

alone).
(3) inhibition of postlabeling by [3h]dfp. treatment of ache (9.3 units) with [3h]dfp gives 6140 ( 687
dpm (n ) 6) as radiolabeled ache. pretreatment with
pocl3 at 0-220 µm (same conditions as  xxxd2940xxx  protection), and then incubation with [3h]dfp gives a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3h]dfp postlabeling
which correlates with the decrease in ache activity
(figure 5). the radioactivity is verified as [3h]dfplabeled ache by sds-page with predominant labeling
of a 55 kda protein (14).
rates of ache inhibition by pocl3 and subsequent reactivation. the reaction of pocl3 (22 µm) with
electric eel ache (ic50 ) 33 µm) is very fast with 28 (
1% (n ) 5) inhibition at 1 min, 40 ( 7% (n ) 4) at 5 min,
and not increasing thereafter (15-30 min). at 220 µm
pocl3, 99% of the ache activity is inhibited and does
not recover spontaneously in 1-7 h. recovery is assisted
neither chemically by 2-pam nor enzymatically with
mouse liver cytosol or blood plasma.

hydrolysis of pocl3, stability of intermediates,
and reaction with serine. the initial hydrolysis
product from pocl3 is hop(o)cl2, identified by 31p nmr,
directly and after trapping with dimethylamine. hop(o)cl2 forms instantly in both buffer (ph 7.4) and water
and converts to phosphate without 31p nmr evidence for
(ho)2p(o)cl [which has been identified from hydrolysis
of pcl5 (15)]. in the presence of serine, hop(o)cl2 gives
an about 3% yield of  xxxd1857xxx  observed by 31p nmr
(shoulder of a much larger phosphate peak) and confirmed by spiking with the authentic standard.  xxxd2068xxx (o)cl2 also hydrolyzes within 1 min to o-ethyl phosphoric
acid with no intermediates observed by 31p nmr.
hop(o)cl2 is proposed to be the ultimate inhibitor from pocl3. hop(o)cl2 has a potency (ic50)
similar to that of pocl3 for ache from electric eel (2533 µm) and housefly head (10-12 µm) (figure 3). the
ache inhibitory activity from both pocl3 and hop(o)cl2 (each at 73 µm) decreases at the same rate in
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), and when expressed as the
amount of inhibitor, the t1/2 is 2 min (figure 6). the
hydrolysis rate for hop(o)cl2 to h3po4 is much slower
in a 2:1 water/thf mixture as determined by 31p nmr
and loss of ache-inhibiting activity (figure 7). the same
curve is obtained with both end points, so the loss in
inhibitory activity is due to hydrolysis of hop(o)cl2 with
a t1/2 of 50 min.

discussion
the poisoning signs of pocl3 in ip-treated mice and
fumigated houseflies indicate an anticholinesterase action. ache inhibition by pocl3 in mouse quadriceps
muscle and diaphragm (but not brain) is consistent with
neuromuscular block, and buche inhibition in serum is
a potentially useful marker for toxicity. mouse serum
buche is much more sensitive than mouse brain ache
to in vivo inhibition by pocl3, but the opposite relationship is observed for mouse plasma versus brain in vitro,
suggesting that the active agent is present at critical
levels in blood but not brain. on the other hand, in
houseflies pocl3 inhibition of brain ache activity correlates with the toxicity of this fumigant as noted earlier
with many organophosphorus insecticides and chemical
warfare agents applied topically to these insects (16). the
action of pocl3 in a housefly is therefore very similar to
that of the more potent commercial fumigant insecticide
dichlorvos (17).

phosphorochloridic acids shown in brackets are not observed but are presumed to be very reactive intermediates. the phosphoric
acids are predominantly present as anions.  xxxd2940xxx  protects against phosphorylation by forming methylcarbamoyl-ache which can
be subsequently reactivated. the inhibited phosphoenzyme is not reactivated by h2o or 2-pam. pocl3 [hop(o)cl2] inhibition of
[3h]dfp postlabeling establishes ser-200 as the probable site of phosphorylation.

phosphoacetylcholinesterase from pocl3

pocl3 is a selective inhibitor of ache compared with
other serine hydrolases. the average ic50s for pocl3
observed here are 28 µm for four aches, 740 µm for five
buches, 140 µm for the carboxylesterase, and >1000 µm
for three other hydrolases. the most sensitive enzyme
that was assayed was housefly head ache with an ic50
of 12 µm. clearly, considerable specificity is involved in
the esterase-pocl3 reaction to confer the selectivity as
an inhibitor both in vitro and apparently in vivo.
three types of evidence suggest that pocl3 reacts at
ser-200 within the active catalytic triad of electric eel
ache. (1) the concentration-dependent inhibition of [3h]dfp postlabeling of ache (18) correlates to inhibition
of ache hydrolytic activity. (2) protective carbamoylation
of ache with  xxxd2940xxx  at the active-site serine prevents
74% of the inhibition by pocl3 as determined from
enzyme recovery after hydrolytic removal of the carbamoyl moiety. (3) excess (10 mm) acetylcholine substrate
prevents 12% of the ache inhibition by pocl3, although
this same level totally protects ache from [3h]dfp
radiolabeling (14).
the active agent for selective phosphorylation of ache
is proposed to be hop(o)cl2 rather than pocl3 itself
(figure 8). the ache-inhibiting potency and toxicity are
the same for the precursor and ultimate phosphorylating
agent. (ho)2p(o)cl cannot be detected by 31p nmr as
an intermediate in this investigation and was not reported previously for pocl3 hydrolysis (13). pocl3 phosphorylates free serine but via hop(o)cl2 and not (ho)2p(o)cl as previously purported (3). we propose that the
anion of hop(o)cl2 has high affinity for the active site
of ache, positioning it for phosphorylation. the absence
of detectable intermediates in the hydrolysis of hop(o)cl2 to phosphate and conversion of  xxxd2068xxx (o)cl2 to  xxxd2068xxx (o)(oh)2 suggests that ache-op(o)(oh)(cl) (if present)
is rapidly hydrolyzed to ache-op(o)(oh)2. although
amino acids other than ser-200 in electric eel ache may
be sensitive to phosphorylation, those sites seem to have
little effect on the enzymatic activity. the inhibited
enzyme is probably [o-phosphoserine200]ache, analogous
to the proposed [o-phosphoserine198]buche derived from
human plasma buche inhibition by ethephon (19).
although ethephon is much less reactive, it probably also
gives [o- xxxd1857xxx ]ache in vitro since its ic50 is 270
µm for rat brain cholinesterase (20). [o-phosphoserine200]ache of electric eel could not be reactivated with 2-pam
(not surprising since it is similar to aged, organophosphate-inhibited ache), liver cytosol (a protein phosphatase source), or blood plasma. slow reactivation of
[o- xxxd1857xxx ]buche was suggested in vivo for mice
where blood serum buche activity inhibited with ethephon (9) or pocl3 (this study) undergoes partial recovery
by 24 h.
this investigation establishes that the acute toxicity
of pocl3 to mammals and insects is attributable to
hydrolytic activation to hop(o)cl2 which then phosphorylates ache to form the enzymatically inactive phosphoache.
