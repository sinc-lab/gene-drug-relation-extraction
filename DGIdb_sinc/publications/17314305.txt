although the classical mechanism of estrogen action involves activation of nuclear transcription factor receptors, estrogen also has acute
effects on neuronal signaling that occur too rapidly to involve gene expression. these rapid effects are likely to be mediated by extranuclear estrogen receptors associated with the plasma membrane and/or cytoplasmic organelles. here we used a combination of serialsection electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting to show that  xxxg730xxx -␣ is
associated with clusters of vesicles in perisomatic inhibitory boutons in hippocampal ca1 and that estrogen treatment mobilizes these
vesicle clusters toward synapses.  xxxg730xxx -␣ is present in approximately one-third of perisomatic inhibitory boutons, and
specifically in those that express cholecystokinin, not  xxxg1901xxx . we also found a high degree of extranuclear  xxxg730xxx -␣
colocalization with  xxxg1590xxx . our results suggest a novel mode of estrogen action in which a subset of vesicles within a specific
population of inhibitory boutons responds directly to estrogen by moving toward synapses. the mobilization of these vesicles may
influence acute effects of estrogen mediated by  xxxg730xxx -␣ signaling at inhibitory synapses.

introduction
the classical mechanism of estrogen action involves activation of
nuclear transcription factor receptors,  xxxg730xxx -␣
(er␣) (greene et al., 1986; koike et al., 1987) and/or er␤
(kuiper et al., 1996), and subsequent regulation of gene expression. however, estrogens also exert acute effects on synaptic
physiology that occur too rapidly to involve changes in gene expression (teyler et al., 1980; wong and moss, 1992; rudick and
woolley, 2003). these rapid effects have been attributed variously to extranuclear er␣/er␤ or to novel ers (qiu et al., 2006).
the er(s) mediating the rapid effects of estrogen could be located
at the plasma membrane and/or in cytoplasmic compartments.
some studies have reported extranuclear immunoreactivity for
er␣ (blaustein et al., 1992; milner et al., 2001) or er␤ (mitra et
al., 2003) in dendrites, axons, and glia in the hypothalamus and
hippocampus. however, these studies are primarily qualitative,
and little is known about how extranuclear ers might influence
neuronal function.
the dorsal ca1 region of the hippocampus is a likely site for
extranuclear er action. estrogen has profound effects on synaptic structure and function in ca1, yet few neurons in this region

express a nuclear er (hart et al., 2001; blurton-jones and
tuszynski, 2002; mitra et al., 2003). estrogen increases dendritic
spine and excitatory synapse numbers in ca1 (woolley and
mcewen, 1992; adams et al., 2001), increases the sensitivity of
ca1 pyramidal cells to excitatory synaptic input (woolley et al.,
1997; rudick and woolley, 2001), and increases dorsal hippocampal seizure susceptibility (terasawa and timiras, 1968).
both in vitro (murphy et al., 1998) and in vivo (rudick and woolley, 2001; rudick et al., 2003) studies suggest that estrogen regulates excitatory synaptic connectivity through an initial suppression of inhibitory gabaergic synaptic transmission. consistent
with a direct effect of estrogen on gabaergic neurons, nearly all
of the neurons in dorsal ca1 that express a nuclear er are
gabaergic (hart et al., 2001). these cells express er␣; although
some ca1 cells express er␤ mrna (shughrue et al., 1997), there
is little evidence for er␤ protein in ca1 (blurton-jones and
tuszynski, 2002; mitra et al., 2003). however, despite the fact
that nuclear er␣ in dorsal ca1 is limited to gabaergic neurons,
only 5–14% of these neurons express er␣ (hart et al., 2001).
thus, it appears that too few cells express a nuclear er to account
entirely for the widespread effects of estrogen on ca1 synapses.
in addition to the few er␣-positive nuclei in ca1, there is
substantial er␣ immunoreactivity (ir) in the neuropil of this
region. because extranuclear er␣-ir is particularly distinct in
the cell body layer, we hypothesized that er␣ might be present in
axonal boutons of gabaergic basket cells that form perisomatic
synapses with ca1 pyramidal cells. here we used serial-section
electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence to show that clusters of vesicles within a specific neuro-

materials and methods
animals. all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the
national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals and were approved by the northwestern university institutional
animal care and use committee. twenty adult, female sprague dawley
rats [⬃250 g; 10 for bright-field microscopy and electron microscopy
(em), and 10 for immunofluorescence; harlan, indianapolis, in] were
ovariectomized under ketamine (85 mg/kg)/xylazine (13 mg/kg, i.p.)
anesthesia and 3 d later were given subcutaneous injections of 10 ␮g of
17␤- xxxd2038xxx  or oil vehicle as described previously (rudick and
woolley, 2001; ledoux and woolley, 2005). twenty-four hours after
injection, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(80 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused either with 2% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pb) for immunolabeling with
diaminobenzidine (dab; sigma, st. louis, mo) or with 4% paraformaldehyde in pb for immunofluorescence. additional adult female rats
(⬃250 g; harlan) were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde in pb for immunolabeling with silver-enhanced nanogold particles (nanoprobes, yaphank, ny) or with buffer containing protease
inhibitors for western blots. the efficacy of estradiol treatment was verified by visual assessment of the uterus at the time of perfusion.
immunolabeling for bright-field microscopy and em. immunostaining
for er␣ was as described previously (hart et al., 2001). briefly,
perfusion-fixed brains were removed, blocked to contain the hippocampus, postfixed overnight at 4°c, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, and
sectioned (50 or 100 ␮m), using an sm 2000 r freezing microtome
(leica, bannockburn, il), into coronal sections spanning the dorsal hippocampus. to increase antigenicity, tissue was preincubated in 10% sodium borohydride (sigma) before processing (leenen et al., 1985). for
visualization with dab, alternating sections were labeled with rabbit
polyclonal mc-20 (0.5 ␮g/ml; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz,
ca) or mouse monoclonal 6f11 (1:50; novocastra, newcastle, uk), followed by species-specific biotinylated igg (1:800; vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca), and visualized with dab using an abc kit (vector
laboratories). neither mc-20 (azcoitia et al., 1999) nor 6f11 (bevitt et
al., 1997) cross-reacts with er␤. some sections were then dehydrated,
cleared, and coverslipped under eukitt for bright-field evaluation of nuclear and exatranuclear labeling. the remaining sections were stained
with osmium tetroxide and flat embedded in eponate resin (ted pella,
redding, ca) for em. for each brain, 200 –230 serial thin sections (⬃70
nm) were cut on a reichert ultracut s ultramicrotome (leica), collected
on formvar-coated slot grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate (ted pella). brains were coded before sectioning so that the experimenter was blind to the treatment condition during all phases of
image collection, three-dimensional reconstruction, and analysis.
additional animals were used for mc-20 immunolabeling visualized
with silver-enhanced nanogold particles. tissue was processed identically to that above, except that the primary incubation was followed by
nanogold-coupled igg (1:50) and hq-silver reagent (nanoprobes). sections were then stained with osmium tetroxide and flat embedded in
eponate resin (ted pella) for thin sectioning. short series of thin sections
(⬃70 nm) were cut and, as above, collected on formvar-coated slot grids
and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
quantification of er␣-immunoreactive nuclei. the numbers of er␣immunoreactive nuclei in the dorsal subiculum, ca1, ca3, and dentate
gyrus subregions were estimated using the optical disector/fractionator
(west et al., 1991) as described by hart et al. (2001). tissue was visualized
on an olympus (tokyo, japan) bx60 microscope equipped with a dage
(michigan city, in) dc330 camera and imagepro plus software (media
cybernetics, silver spring, md). briefly, a grid consisting of squares (353
␮m 2) was superimposed random-systematically over a lowmagnification image of every fifth section through the dorsal hippocam-

pus. each square contained an identically placed counting frame that was
1/16th the area of the square. when any part of the hippocampus was
contained within the counting frame, the number of labeled nuclei
within the frame was counted. the most intensely labeled nuclei generally were observed in conjunction with lighter cytoplasmic labeling in the
soma and most proximal dendrites. counts were made with a 100⫻
oil-immersion lens starting 3 ␮m below the surface and continuing in 0.5
␮m steps though a depth of 13 ␮m. the total number of cells was then
estimated using the following formula: # cells ⫽ ⌺q ⫺ (t/h)(1/asf )(1/ssf ),
where q ⫺ is the total number of cells counted, t is the section thickness
(50 ␮m), h is the height of the disector (10 ␮m), asf is the area sampling
fraction (1/16), and ssf is the section sampling fraction (1/5).
three-dimensional em reconstruction. the dorsal ca1 pyramidal cell
layer was imaged using a jeol (peabody, ma) 100cx electron microscope. in tissue labeled with mc-20 visualized with dab, five areas, each
containing an er␣-immunoreactive perisomatic bouton, were identified
in a section near the middle of each set of serial thin sections. negatives of
these five areas were taken  xxxd1891xxx ,000⫻ from the middle section and from
40 to 50 serial sections on both sides (five stacks of 80 –100 serial negatives per brain). negatives were scanned at 1600 dpi and aligned with
sem align software (courtesy of k. m. harris, university of texas, austin, tx, and j. c. fiala, boston university, boston, ma). the plasma
membrane, synaptic densities, and mitochondria were traced and reconstructed using igl trace software (courtesy of k. m. harris and j. c.
fiala). the location of each vesicle in a bouton was also marked. measurements of volume, synaptic area, and numbers of vesicles for each
bouton were generated using igl trace. the distance between each vesicle and synapse in a bouton was measured using reconstruct software
(courtesy of k. m. harris and j. c. fiala) and converted into a measurement of relative distance, with 1.0 being the maximum distance from the
synapse that a vesicle could be. for boutons with more than one synapse,
the synapse nearest to the er␣-immunoreactive vesicle cluster was used
for the relative distance measure.
western blots. western blots were used to confirm mc-20 specificity in
dorsal ca1. buffer-perfused brains were removed, blocked to contain the
hippocampus, and sectioned (300 ␮m), using an ots 4000 oscillating
tissue slicer (ems, hatfield, pa), into coronal sections spanning the
rostrocaudal extent of the dorsal hippocampus. the ca1 region was
dissected from these slices on ice and homogenized in ice-cold 20 mm
pbs, ph 7.4, with 2 mm egta and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf). the homogenate was lysed with 1.5% triton x-100, incubated
on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 ⫻ g for 20 min. the supernatant was collected as the whole-cell fraction and kept frozen at ⫺80°c
until use.
western blots were also used to confirm er␣ in cytoplasmic, synaptosomal, and synaptic vesicle fractions isolated from the dorsal hippocampus by differential centrifugation (huttner et al., 1983). for these
experiments, rats were perfused with ice-cold homogenization buffer
(320 mm sucrose, 4 mm hepes-naoh buffer, ph 7.4, 2 mm egta, 1 mm
sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm pmsf, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm
sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin,
and 1 ␮g/ml aprotinin). the brains were rapidly removed, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4°c. dorsal hippocampi were dissected
and homogenized, followed by centrifugation at 1000 ⫻ g for 10 min to
remove large cell fragments and nuclear material. the supernatant was
centrifuged at 17,000 ⫻ g for 15 min to yield cytoplasmic proteins in the
supernatant. the pellet from this spin was resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 17,000 ⫻ g for an additional 15 min to yield
washed synaptosomes. the synaptosomal fraction then was hypoosmotically lysed and centrifuged at 25,000 ⫻ g for 20 min to yield
synaptosomal plasma membranes and crude synaptic vesicles. crude
synaptic vesicles then were centrifuged at 160,000 ⫻ g for 2 h to pellet the
synaptic vesicle fraction. cytoplasmic proteins, washed synaptosomes,
and synaptic vesicle fractions were analyzed. for all western blots, protein concentration was determined using the bio-rad (hercules, ca)
protein assay. the protein sample was mixed with laemmli sample
buffer (62.5 mm tris-hcl, ph 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% sds, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 5% ␤- xxxd26xxx ), boiled for 5 min, and separated on a 10% sds-page gel. after electrophoresis, proteins were

transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (millipore, billerica,
ma). the membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk, probed for  xxxg2236xxx  with mab5258 (1:1,000,000; chemicon, temecula, ca) and/or
er␣ with mc-20 (0.1 ␮g/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidasecoupled anti-mouse (1:2000) or anti-rabbit (1:1000) igg (vector laboratories), and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl plus;
ge healthcare, piscataway, nj).
immunofluorescence. perfusion-fixed brains were removed, blocked to
contain the hippocampus, postfixed overnight at 4°c, cryoprotected
with 30% sucrose, and cut on a freezing microtome (leica) into coronal
sections (40 ␮m) spanning the rostrocaudal extent of the dorsal hippocampus. sections were systematically distributed into four groups
double labeled for er␣ (0.1 ␮g/ml, mc-20) and one of the following:
mouse monoclonal  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase 65 ( xxxg850xxx ) (0.3 ␮g/ml,
mab351; chemicon), mouse monoclonal  xxxg1901xxx  (pv) (1:8000,
p3088; sigma), rabbit polyclonal cholecystokinin (cck) (1:1000,
pc206l; calbiochem, la jolla, ca), or rabbit polyclonal  xxxg1590xxx 
(npy) (1:4000, n9528; sigma). tissue processing was as described previously (hart et al., 2001), except for visualization with species-specific
igg directly coupled to a fluorochrome. for er␣ colocalization, er␣-ir
was visualized with alexa fluor 568, whereas gad-, pv-, cck-, and
npy-irs were visualized with alexa fluor 488 (each 2.5 ␮g/ml; invitrogen, san diego, ca). for npy colocalization with gad, npy-ir was
visualized with alexa fluor 568, whereas gad-ir was visualized with
alexa fluor 488. incubations were simultaneous in cases in which primaries were raised in different species (er␣ and gad or pv); controls
included omission of primary antiserum or antibody. incubations were
sequential in cases in which primaries were raised in the same species
(er␣ and cck or npy). in these cases, a second blocking step was
included after the first secondary incubation, and some tissue was processed with the second primary antiserum omitted as an additional control. in these controls, no labeling of the first primary antiserum with the
second secondary antiserum was detected. all sections were mounted in
order on subbed slides, dehydrated, cleared, rehydrated, coverslipped
under vectashield (vector laboratories), and sealed with nail polish.
slides were coded before image collection, so the experimenter was
blind to the treatment condition of each brain during all phases of image
collection and analysis. tissue was imaged using a spinning disc laser
confocal system (perkinelmer, wellesley, ma) with a 100⫻ oil objective.
for each brain, three image stacks in each hemisphere were collected
from three sections in each brain, for a total of 18 stacks per brain. the
volume of each stack was 21,600 ␮m 3 (er␣ and gad or pv) or 10,800
␮m 3 (er␣ and cck or npy) and consisted of a 70 ⫻ 70 ␮m image field
taken at 0.2 ␮m z-steps with the ca1 pyramidal cell layer in the center of
the field. quantification of immunofluorescence and colocalization were
performed using volocity software (improvision, lexington, ma).
statistics. cumulative histograms of relative distances were generated
for oil and estradiol treatment groups and compared using the kolmogorov–smirnov (k-s) test (dmax ⫽ 0.163 for p ⬍ 0.01; n ⫽ 100). the mean
relative distance of er␣-immunoreactive vesicles and means for measures of basic structural characteristics of boutons as well as fluorescence
and colocalization were calculated for each brain, and treatment groups
were compared using student’s t test (unpaired, two-tailed; n ⫽ 4) using
spss (chicago, il) software.
data display. all figures were prepared with photoshop (adobe systems, san jose, ca). graphs and histograms were plotted using sigmaplot (spss). bouton reconstruction files were imported into and rendered with 3d studiomax (autodesk, san raphael, ca).

nuclear and extranuclear er␣-ir
we confirmed nuclear and extranuclear er␣-ir in the dorsal
ca1 cell body layer of adult female rats using mc-20, a polyclonal
antiserum raised against the c terminus of mouse er␣ visualized
with dab. as described previously (hart et al., 2001), nuclear
er␣-ir was present in a relatively small proportion of cells located
primarily in the dendritic layers; pyramidal cell nuclei were unlabeled (fig. 1a). extranuclear er␣-immunoreactive puncta were

observed throughout ca1 but were particularly distinct in the cell
body layer and occasionally appeared to ring unlabeled pyramidal
cell somata. this suggested that er␣-ir might be contained within
perisomatic axonal boutons of inhibitory basket cells, a question we
addressed subsequently with em. both nuclear and extranuclear
er␣ labeling were absent when the primary antiserum was eliminated (fig. 1b) or when the antiserum was preadsorbed with blocking peptide (hart et al., 2001). western blots of whole-cell extracts
from dorsal ca1 confirmed that the mc-20 antiserum recognized a
single protein band at ⬃67 kda (fig. 1c), the predicted size of er␣
in the rat (koike et al., 1987). qualitatively similar punctate er␣-ir

was also observed in tissue labeled with 6f11, a monoclonal antibody
raised against full-length er␣ (data not shown).
we confirmed that, as reported previously for 72 h treatment
(hart et al., 2001), estrogen treatment for 24 h in vivo had no
significant effect on the number of er␣-immunoreactive nuclei
in any hippocampal subregion. we quantified er␣immunoreactive nuclei in the dorsal hippocampus of six ovariectomized oil-treated (ovx⫹o) and six ovariectomized,
estrogen-treated (ovx⫹e) adult female rats using the optical
disector/fractionator. the total numbers of er␣immunoreactive nuclei were as follows: in subiculum: 1850 ⫾
507 (ovx⫹o) and 1100 ⫾ 73 (ovx⫹e); in ca1: 1566 ⫾ 286
(ovx⫹o) and 917 ⫾ 70 (ovx⫹e); in ca3: 3567 ⫾ 724
(ovx⫹o) and 2733 ⫾ 279 (ovx⫹e); in dentate gyrus: 2000 ⫾
392 (ovx⫹o) and 1767 ⫾ 196 (ovx⫹e). all p values were
⬎0.07. thus, in contrast to the effect of estrogen on hippocampal
slice cultures, in which estrogen treatment for 8 d upregulates
er␣-ir (rune et al., 2002), shorter treatments with estrogen in
vivo do not appear to influence nuclear er␣ expression in the
hippocampus.
next, we used pre-embedding em immunocytochemistry to
investigate whether inhibitory axonal boutons in the ca1 cell
body layer contain er␣-ir. we were especially interested in the
possibility that er␣ is expressed in inhibitory boutons because
we have shown previously that estrogen suppresses inhibitory
gabaergic synaptic transmission in ca1 (rudick and woolley,
2001; rudick et al., 2003). inhibitory boutons were recognized as
those that formed synapses with symmetric presynaptic and
postsynaptic densities, ⬎95% of which are gaba immunoreactive in the ca1 cell body layer (ledoux and woolley, 2005).
electron imaging of tissue labeled for er␣ using either the
mc-20 antiserum (fig. 1 d–f ) or the 6f11 antibody (fig. 1g)
revealed that er␣-ir within inhibitory boutons was most often
found associated with vesicles that appeared to be clustered. occasionally, we also observed labeling on patches of the plasma
membrane near er␣-immunoreactive vesicles. additionally,
small clumps of er␣-ir were present within pyramidal cell bodies, excitatory boutons, dendrites, and glia. the pattern of immunoreactivity was identical in tissue labeled with mc-20 compared
with 6f11.
we performed two additional analyses to confirm er␣ associated with synaptic vesicles: em immunocytochemistry with immunogold visualization and western blot analysis of synaptic
vesicle fractions. evaluation of extranuclear er␣-ir in the ca1
cell body layer visualized with immunogold showed the same
pattern of labeling as observed with dab. gold particles were
observed most frequently associated with vesicles in axonal boutons (1–5 particles) (fig. 2 a), dendritic spines (1– 6 particles),
and glia (1–10 particles); particles also were observed in neuronal
nuclei and associated with somatic organelles. in some series,
gold particles were observed in the same locations spanning consecutive sections.
western blots of cell fractions probed with mc-20 (fig. 2 b)
also confirmed that er␣ is associated with synaptic vesicles. consistent with western blots of whole-cell fractions, cytoplasmic
protein fractions contained a single band at ⬃67 kda.  xxxg2236xxx , a presynaptic vesicle protein, was present in relatively low
levels in cytoplasmic fractions.  xxxg2236xxx  was concentrated
in synaptosomes, as expected, but er␣ did not represent a sufficient proportion of total synaptosomal protein to be detectable.
however, er␣ was detectable in synaptic vesicle fractions derived
from synaptosomes. interestingly, er␣ labeling in synaptic vesicle fractions consistently showed three bands. the major band

appeared at the expected ⬃67 kda, along with a slightly higher
molecular weight band and a faint band at a lower molecular
weight. the higher molecular weight band could represent er␣
that has been post-translationally modified by phosphorylation
or palmitoylation, which has been shown to promote its association with membranes (acconcia et al., 2005). the identity of the
lower molecular weight band is unknown.
colocalization of extranuclear er␣-ir with gad-ir
having shown that er␣-ir is contained within inhibitory axonal
boutons where it is associated with vesicles, we next asked how
many inhibitory boutons contain er␣-ir. to investigate this
question, we double labeled hippocampal tissue for er␣ and
gad, the rate-limiting enzyme in gaba synthesis and a marker
for inhibitory neurons; gad antibodies label inhibitory axonal
boutons intensely. we evaluated gad-ir and er␣-ir in five
ovx⫹o and five ovx⫹e adult female rats. projected images
from stacks of optical sections showed characteristic gad-ir in

the cell body layer, with labeled varicosities arranged in rings around unlabeled
pyramidal cell somata (fig. 3a). for both
gad-ir and er␣-ir, measurements of
fluorescence intensity, volume, number of
labeled objects, and percentage of colocalization were unaffected by estrogen, so
data from both treatment groups were
combined (n ⫽ 10). the lack of estrogen
effect on extranuclear er␣-ir mirrored
the lack of effect on nuclear er␣-ir.
quantitative analysis of 18 image stacks
per brain (21,600 ␮m 3 per stack) showed
that 32.4 ⫾ 0.6% of the 3815 ⫾ 141 gadimmunoreactive varicosities per stack
contained er␣-immunoreactive puncta
(fig. 3b,c), and 24.0 ⫾ 0.5% of the 5549 ⫾
187 er␣-immunoreactive puncta per stack
were located in gad-immunoreactive varicosities (fig. 3c). this analysis indicated
that extranuclear er␣-ir is found in approximately one-third of gabaergic varicosities in the cell body layer but that a substantial fraction of punctate er␣-ir is
located in non-gabaergic structures as
well. the observation that not all er␣immunoreactive puncta colocalize with
gad-immunoreactive varicosities is consistent with previous qualitative em observations of er␣-ir in multiple extranuclear
sites, such as dendrites, glia, excitatory axonal boutons, and somatic organelles
(milner et al., 2001).
serial em reconstruction of axonal
boutons containing er␣-ir
next, we used serial-section em to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of
axon
segments
containing

although the basic structural features of er␣immunoreactive-containing boutons did not differ between
ovx⫹o and ovx⫹e animals, plotting the location of presynaptic vesicles within each bouton revealed a striking effect of
estrogen to shift the location of er␣-immunoreactive vesicle
clusters closer to synapses (fig. 5 a, b). because axonal boutons
vary widely by size, we determined the proximity of presynaptic
vesicles to synapses using a relative distance measurement. for
each bouton, the distance between each presynaptic vesicle and
the nearest synapse was measured and converted to a value between 0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being the maximum distance that a
vesicle could be from the synapse. comparison of histograms of
relative distances in the 33 completely reconstructed boutons
that contained er␣-ir (fig. 5c,d, filled bars) showed that labeled vesicle clusters were located significantly closer to the nearest synapse in ovx⫹e compared with ovx⫹o boutons (n ⫽ 13

the mean (⫾sem) for each parameter is shown both for boutons with (er␣⫹) and without (er␣⫺) er␣-immunoreactive vesicle clusters from oil- and estradiol-treated animals. neither er␣-ir content nor estrogen treatment
significantly affected any parameter measured.

might be affected by estrogen, no significant difference or trend was
detected (k-s test, p ⬎ 0.20). thus, the effect of estrogen to shift the
location of presynaptic vesicles is specific for those that are er␣
immunoreactive. the observation that estrogen regulates the location of labeled vesicle clusters relative to synapses argues strongly
that er␣-ir on vesicles is either er␣ itself or a very closely related
protein. these appear to be a specific subset of presynaptic vesicles that, because they contain er␣, are regulated by estrogen
separately from other presynaptic vesicles in the same bouton.
colocalization of extranuclear er␣-ir with pv- or cck-ir
the perisomatic inhibitory boutons we reconstructed arise from
basket cells, a population of gabaergic neurons that can be divided into two subtypes based on pv or cck immunolabeling,
each of which has distinct physiological roles in the hippocampus
(freund and buzsaki, 1996; freund, 2003). to determine
whether er␣-ir is located specifically in one class of basket cell,
we used double-label immunofluorescence to quantify colocalization of er␣-ir with pv- or cck-ir in the cell body layer in
five ovx⫹o and five ovx⫹e animals. estrogen treatment did
not affect any parameter of pv-ir, cck-ir, or colocalization, so
data from both groups were combined (n ⫽ 10). tissue double
labeled for pv and er␣ showed the characteristic “beads on a
string” pv staining of axons and axonal varicosities, but there was
no colocalization of er␣-ir and pv-ir (fig. 6 a). in contrast,
er␣-ir did colocalize with cck-ir, which labels in a more
punctate pattern (morales and bloom, 1997) than gad or pv
(fig. 6 b). quantitative analysis of 18 image stacks per brain
(10,800 ␮m 3 per stack) showed that 25.2 ⫾ 0.6% of 3817 ⫾ 177
cck-immunoreactive puncta per stack colocalized with er␣-ir
and 36.2 ⫾ 0.8% of 2762 ⫾ 72 er␣-immunoreactive puncta per
stack colocalized with cck-ir (fig. 6 e). thus, the axonal boutons containing er␣-immunoreactive vesicle clusters that we analyzed with serial-section em likely belong to cck basket cells
and not pv basket cells.
because the number of cck-immunoreactive puncta was
greater than the number of gad-immunoreactive varicosities in
the same volume, either there are multiple cck-immunoreactive
puncta per varicosity and/or some cck-immunoreactive puncta
are located in structures other than gabaergic varicosities. consistent with the second possibility, cck labeling has been shown
previously in dendrites in ca1 (harris et al., 1985; morales and
bloom, 1997). the number of er␣/cck-immunoreactive structures per stack was 902 ⫾ 42, which is similar to the number of
er␣/gad-immunoreactive structures calculated for the same
volume, 624 ⫾ 31. thus, most of the puncta that colocalize
er␣-ir and cck-ir are likely to be in gabaergic boutons.
colocalization of extranuclear er␣-ir with npy-ir
a subset of gabaergic neurons in ca1 also expresses npy
(freund and buzsaki, 1996), and some npy neurons express

nuclear er␣ (sar et al., 1990), suggesting that extranuclear
er␣-ir also might be found in npy neurons. to investigate this,
we analyzed colocalization of er␣-ir and npy-ir in the same
tissue used for pv and cck analyses. no measure of immunofluorescence or colocalization was affected by estrogen treatment, so data from both groups were combined (n ⫽ 10). quantitative analysis of er␣-ir and npy-ir in the cell body layer (fig.
6c) showed that 30.3 ⫾ 0.6% of 4165 ⫾ 170 npyimmunoreactive puncta colocalized with er␣-ir and 49.9 ⫾
2.2% of 2662 ⫾ 44 er␣-immunoreactive puncta colocalized with
npy-ir (fig. 6 e).
the number of er␣/npy-immunoreactive objects was
greater than the number of er␣/gad-immunoreactive objects
in the same volume, which suggested that a substantial fraction of
er␣/npy-ir might not be gabaergic. thus, we performed an
additional experiment to quantify npy/gad colocalization (fig.
6 d) and found that ⬃73% of npy-immunoreactive puncta in
the cell body layer colocalized with gad (data not shown). the
remaining ⬃27% of npy-immunoreactive puncta likely belong
to dendrites, excitatory boutons, or cytoplasmic organelles (milner and veznedaroglu, 1992; v. a. ledoux and c. s. woolley
unpublished observations). interestingly, the number of er␣immunoreactive puncta per stack that colocalized with npy-ir
(⬃1250) is very similar to the number of npy-immunoreactive
puncta that were negative for gad (⬃1125). it is therefore possible that many er␣/npy-immunoreactive puncta are not located in gabaergic boutons.

discussion
we used serial-section em immunocytochemistry, cell fractionation, and immunofluorescence to show that er␣ is associated
with clusters of vesicles in inhibitory presynaptic boutons in the
hippocampal ca1 cell body layer and that estrogen treatment
shifts the location of these vesicles toward synapses. er␣immunoreactive vesicle clusters are abundant, occurring in approximately one-third of perisomatic gabaergic boutons, but
only in a subset of those on a single axon. extranuclear er␣-ir
colocalizes with cck and npy, but not with pv, indicating that
different neurochemical classes of gaba neurons are likely to be
differentially sensitive to estrogen through er␣ located in presynaptic boutons. our findings point to a novel mode of estrogen
action in the brain in which estrogen acts directly on a subset of
er␣-containing vesicles to mobilize them toward synapses.
er␣-immunoreactive vesicles
er␣-immunoreactive vesicles may contain gaba and undergo
exocytosis to release neurotransmitter. labeled vesicles in perisomatic boutons were small clear vesicles that were morphologically indistinguishable from unlabeled ones. we did occasionally
observe er␣-ir associated with presynaptic densities, suggesting

fusion at synaptic active zones. if er␣-immunoreactive vesicles
function to release neurotransmitter, then our results indicate a
specialized subpopulation of gabaergic vesicles within individual presynaptic boutons that is regulated independently of the
others (i.e., by estrogen). if this is the case, then the simplest
interpretation of the estrogen-induced mobilization of labeled
vesicles is that it reflects their movement toward synaptic release
sites. mobilization of er␣-immunoreactive vesicles toward synapses may influence the sensitivity of hippocampal synapses to
acute estrogen action.
it is important to note that this effect to mobilize er␣immunoreactive vesicles toward synapses is distinct from our
previous observations that 24 h estrogen treatment suppresses
gaba release (rudick et al., 2003) and decreases the number of
vesicles docked at gabaergic synapses (ledoux and woolley,
2005). our previous studies did not distinguish between boutons
and/or vesicles that contain er␣ and those that do not and focused specifically on docked vesicles that are much closer to presynaptic release sites than the vast majority of er␣immunoreactive vesicles. thus, the observation that estrogen
mobilizes specifically er␣-immunoreactive vesicles toward synapses is further evidence that er␣ confers specialized estrogen
sensitivity to a distinct subset of vesicles in inhibitory boutons.

j. neurosci., february 21, 2007 • 27(8):2102–2111 • 2109

in addition to the possibility that er␣-immunoreactive vesicles are neurotransmitter vesicles, an alternative is that er␣immunoreactive vesicles are specialized endosomes that deliver
er␣ to, and/or retrieve it from, the bouton plasma membrane.
patches of er␣-ir at the bouton membrane, usually near labeled
vesicle clusters, are consistent with this idea. studies in a variety of
cell types have demonstrated er␣ at the plasma membrane where
it functions as a g-protein-coupled receptor (razandi et al., 1999;
wyckoff et al., 2001) and can influence secretion of neuropeptides (navarro et al., 2003). if er␣-immunoreactive vesicles are
involved in regulating membrane-associated er␣, then estrogen
effects on er␣-immunoreactive vesicle location could result
from exocytosis and/or endocytosis at different sites relative to
synapses. interestingly, however, we found that the number of
vesicles per er␣-immunoreactive cluster was not affected by estrogen, arguing against the idea that estrogen specifically stimulates er␣ delivery to or retrieval from the plasma membrane.
er␣ contains neither a known membrane targeting sequence
nor stretches of hydrophobic residues characteristic of an integral
membrane protein; however, in breast cancer cells and chinese
hamster ovary cells, er␣ has been shown to associate with
 xxxg346xxx , which facilitates its transport to the membrane
(razandi et al., 2003). in these cells, membrane er␣ forms a
signaling complex with other proteins through which estrogen
can rapidly increase camp and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3k)
(for review, see levin, 2005). this requires dimerizationcompetent er␣ and involves the ligand-binding and af2 domains (razandi et al., 2004). similar rapid signaling through
mapk and pi3k also occurs in neurons (bryant et al., 2005;
mannella and brinton, 2006). mobilization of er␣-containing
vesicles could influence synaptic function by bringing an
estrogen-sensitive rapid signaling complex nearer to synaptic release sites.
the ability of membrane-associated er␣ to activate mapk
could provide a link between rapid estrogen signaling and our
previous observation that estrogen decreases the number of vesicles docked at gabaergic synapses. estrogen acutely activates
mapk in hippocampal neurons (bi et al., 2000), possibly
through a membrane er (kuroki et al., 2000). one substrate for
mapk in presynaptic boutons is synapsin-i, which anchors synaptic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton in a phosphorylationdependent manner (jovanovic et al., 1996). phosphorylation of
synapsin-i at mapk sites is involved in mobilization of synaptic
vesicles for release (chi et al., 2003), and at inhibitory synapses,
synapsins are critical for maintaining the readily releasable pool
of vesicles (gitler et al., 2004). as mentioned above, we have
shown previously that estrogen suppresses gaba release in ca1,
at least in part by decreasing the number of vesicles docked at
inhibitory synapses. therefore, it is tempting to speculate that
er␣ signaling in inhibitory boutons could mediate the estrogeninduced decrease in docked vesicle number through regulation of
mapk and synapsin phosphorylation.
colocalization of er␣ and cck
the finding that extranuclear er␣-ir colocalizes with cck, but
not pv, indicates that direct effects of estrogen on presynaptic
boutons likely occur only in the cck subtype of the basket cell.
this is significant because pv and cck cells differ in their electrophysiological and anatomical properties and their influence
on pyramidal cells. most pv basket cells are capable of firing at
high frequencies without accommodation and release gaba synchronously; cck cells fire at lower frequencies, do show accom-

hart et al. • estrogen mobilizes er␣-immunoreactive vesicles

modation, and release gaba asynchronously (pawelzik et al.,
2002; hefft and jonas, 2005). these and other findings (klausberger et al., 2003; vreugdenhil et al., 2003) have been interpreted
to indicate that pv cells play a greater role than cck cells in
entraining rhythmic activity of pyramidal cells, particularly at
gamma frequency (freund, 2003).
additionally, anatomical studies show that pv cells receive, on
average, ⬃15,000 excitatory and ⬃1000 inhibitory inputs (gulyas et al., 1999), whereas cck cells receive only ⬃5000 excitatory
but ⬃3000 inhibitory inputs (matyas et al., 2004). cck cells also
receive gabaergic input from a specialized, interneuron-driven
population of calretinin-positive neurons (gulyas et al., 1996) and
serotonergic input from the median raphe, neither of which innervate pv cells (miettinen and freund, 1992; morales and bloom,
1997). thus, pv and cck cells appear to monitor the activities of
different populations of neurons, and cck cells are in a better position to respond to modulatory gabaergic and serotonergic inputs.
these differences have led to the hypothesis that relatively nonplastic
ensembles of pv basket cells are responsible for synchronizing the
activity of pyramidal cells, whereas more modifiable groups of cck
basket cells integrate local and subcortical inputs to fine-tune pyramidal cell activity (freund, 2003). the colocalization of er␣-ir with
cck- but not pv-ir suggests that estrogen could act through er␣ in
cck basket cell axonal boutons to influence such fine-tuning of
hippocampal activity.
colocalization of er␣ and npy
the colocalization of er␣-ir with npy-ir provides an additional clue to the role of extranuclear er␣ in the hippocampus. in
ca1, npy is expressed primarily in gabaergic interneurons
(freund and buzsaki, 1996) but also is expressed within excitatory neurons (milner and veznedaroglu, 1992). npy inhibits
presynaptic glutamate release in the hippocampus (colmers et
al., 1988), and in cortical synaptosomes, this occurs through a y1
receptor-dependent reduction in ca 2⫹ influx through n- and/or
p/q-type ca 2⫹ channels (wang, 2005). although it is likely that
er␣/npy sites in the ca1 cell body layer are located too far from
most glutamatergic inputs to influence them, it is possible that a
similar mechanism could regulate gaba release at perisomatic
synapses. calcium-dependent gaba release in ca1 also depends
on n- and/or p/q-type ca 2⫹ channels (doze et al., 1995). additionally, npy has been shown to suppress gabaergic synaptic
transmission in the spinal cord (moran et al., 2004) and paraventricular nucleus (pronchuk et al., 2002), and at least some
gabaergic neurons express y1 receptors (oberto et al., 2001).
thus, sites at which er␣ and npy are colocalized, whether in
inhibitory boutons or other structures, could provide an additional means by which estrogen suppresses gabaergic synaptic
transmission, in this case by modulating the release of npy.
in summary, quantitative analysis of er␣ in perisomatic inhibitory boutons demonstrates a novel mode of estrogen action
in the brain, to mobilize a specific subset of vesicles that contain
er␣. in the ca1 cell body layer, these vesicles occur selectively in
one class of basket cell, cck cells, where they may be a subset of
neurotransmitter vesicles and/or may be involved in regulating
er␣ at the bouton plasma membrane. estrogen previously has
been shown to have profound effects on inhibitory synapses in
ca1 that are likely to be causally related to a subsequent increase
in excitatory synapse number. the current study represents an
initial step toward understanding how estrogen could act
through extranuclear receptors associated with a specific subcellular compartment, presynaptic vesicles, to influence neuronal
function. direct effects of estrogen on presynaptic boutons may

provide a link between rapid estrogen signaling (e.g., through
modulation of protein kinase activity) and the longer-term effects of estrogen on synaptic structure and function.
