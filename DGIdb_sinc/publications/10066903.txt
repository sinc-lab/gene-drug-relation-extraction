1. whole-cell clamp recordings of the compound synaptic current elicited by afferent stimulation
of schaffer collaterals showed that blockade of the nmda, ampa and gabaa receptormediated components by 6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3-dione (nbqx), 3-((r)2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (r-cpp) and  xxxd2947xxx , respectively, left a
small residual current in 39 out of 41 ca1 pyramidal neurones in organotypic cultures and 9
out of 16 ca1 cells in acutely prepared slices.
2. this current represented 2·9 ± 0·4 % of the compound evoked synaptic response in
organoypic cultures and 1·4 ± 0·5 % in slices. it was characterized by a slightly rectifying i—v
curve and a reversal potential of 3·4 ± 5·1 mv.
3. this residual current was insensitive to blockers of gabab, purinergic, muscarinic and 5_ht3
receptors, but it was essentially blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist d_tubocurarine
(91 ± 4 % blockade; 20 ìò), and partly blocked by á_bungarotoxin (200 nò) and methyllycaconitine (10 nò), two antagonists with a higher selectivity for á7 subunit-containing
nicotinic receptors (48 ± 3 % and 55 ± 11 % blockade, respectively).
4. the residual current was of synaptic origin, since it occurred after a small delay; its amplitude
depended upon the stimulation intensity and it was calcium dependent and blocked by the
sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin.
5. we conclude that afferent stimulation applied in the stratum radiatum evokes in some hippocampal neurones a small synaptic current mediated by activation of neuronal nicotinic
receptors.
despite its predominant role in the peripheral nervous
system and particularly at the motor endplate where it was
first discovered, fast nicotinic cholinergic transmission has
been found up to now only exceptionally in the central
nervous system. one classic example is the synaptic activation
of the renshaw cell in the spinal cord, which receives a
cholinergic nicotinic input from motoneurones (eccles et al.
1954). similarly, synaptic nicotinic potentials have been
reported in brainstem vagal motoneurones (zhang et al.
1993) and neuronal  xxxg456xxx  (nachr)
mediated responses could at least in part mediate dopamine
release in the striatum (clarke et al. 1987; futami et al. 1995).
so far, however, there has been no report of fast cholinergic
transmission in mammalian cortical regions.
contrasting with this, nicotine has been shown to play a
major role in modulating brain functions (wonnacott, 1997).
recent developments in gene technology have revealed the
presence in many brain areas of mrna coding for different
nicotinic receptor subtypes (goldman et al. 1987; sargent,

1993). furthermore, the presence of these mrnas correlates
well with reports of the existence of specific binding sites for
both ach analogues and the selective nicotinic receptor
antagonist á_bungarotoxin (á-bgtx; clarke et al. 1985). in
addition, electrophysiological studies made on dissociated
hippocampal neurones have demonstrated the existence of
functional nicotinic receptors and identified several types
of nicotinic currents (alkondon & albuquerque, 1993;
albuquerque et al. 1997). finally, strong evidence implicates
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in behaviour, learning and
memory as well as in the reinforcing actions of nicotine
(role & berg, 1996; picciotto et al. 1998).
a major issue, therefore, has been to understand whether
neuronal nachrs have purely a modulatory role,
representing mainly targets for the low concentrations of
nicotine that reach the brain during smoking, or whether, as
found in the peripheral nervous system, they also mediate
fast synaptic transmission. this is not unlikely considering
the evidence showing the existence in the hippocampus of a

major cholinergic input as well as a few cholinergic cells
(frotscher & leranth, 1985; frotscher et al. 1986, but see
oh et al. 1992). to examine this issue, we used here hippocampal slices and slice cultures (stoppini et al. 1991) and
have analysed whole-cell recordings of the synaptic currents
evoked in ca1 pyramidal neurones in response to afferent
stimulation of schaffer collaterals. through a pharmacological
dissection of the components of these evoked currents, we
provide evidence for the existence in the hippocampus of a
fast current of synaptic origin that appears to be mediated by
nicotinic receptors. a summary of this work was published
in abstract form (hefft et al. 1997).

methods

interface-type organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (300 ìm)
were prepared from 14-day-old rats (sprague—dawley) according to
the method described by stoppini et al. (1991). briefly, 14-day-old
neonate sprague—dawley rats were decapitated following a brief
anaesthesia with  xxxd1993xxx  (4%), the brain removed and the hippocampus dissected out. experiments were carried out in accordance
with the guidelines of the animal welfare committee (authorization
31.1.1024.1190). slices were prepared using a chopper and
maintained at the interface on a porous and transparent membrane
(millicell-cm, millipore). they were maintained in culture in a
medium containing 50% mem (+ 25 mò hepes, 4 mò nahco× +
5 mò tris), 25% horse serum and 25% hanks’ solution, ph 7·2.
bicuculline, ª- xxxd1353xxx , 3_((r)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (r-cpp), 6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3dione (nbqx), and were from tocris cookson ltd, bristol, uk;
tetrodotoxin (ttx) was from latoxan, france; qx-314 was from
alomone laboratories, jerusalem, israel; d_tubocurarine and
á_bungrotoxin were from fluka chemie ag, buchs, switzerland;
and methyllycaconitine (mla) was from research biochemicals
international, switzerland.
recordings were performed between 4 and 10 days after tissue
explantation. most experiments were carried out using hippocampal organotypic cultures, but some of them were done, when
mentioned, with hippocampal slices prepared from 18- to 25-dayold rats. for whole-cell recordings of synaptic currents, the slice
cultures were transferred on a nylon grid in an interface chamber
(1·5 ml; flow of 1 ml min¢). the bath solution contained (mò): 124
nacl, 3 kcl, 1·25 nahµpoú, 24 nahco×, 10 glucose, 1·5 mgclµ, 2
caclµ; it was continuously bubbled with 95% oµ and 5% coµ
(ph 7·4, 290—295 mosmol l¢). the fire-polished low resistance patch
pipettes (1—3 mù) were filled with intracellular saline containing
(mò): 110 csch×so×, 5 nacl, 10 egta in 30 csoh, 1 mgclµ, 1
caclµ, 10 hepes, 2 naµatp, 20 teacl and 5 qx-314 (ph 7·2—7·4,
290 mosmol l¢). gigaseals (10—20 gù) were obtained in stratum
pyramidale of area ca1 by blind searching. in most experiments
carried out on acutely prepared hippocampal slices, whole-cell patch
recording were obtained under visual control using an infrapatch
set-up (luigs & neumann, germany). ca1 pyramidal cells were
identified through their electrophysiological characteristics and in
some instances by intracellular injection of lucifer yellow. neurones
were held at vrest (−60 to −65 mv), and synaptic currents evoked at
0·016—0·033 hz by a bipolar stimulation electrode placed in the
stratum radiatum. a cut was made between ca3 and ca1 to prevent
recurrent excitation. the ratio rinputïrseries was continuously

monitored by a 10 mv—50 ms de- or hyperpolarizing voltage step
preceding nerve fibre stimulation by 130 ms. all experiments were
performed at 34°c. currents were recorded with an axopatch
200a amplifier filtered at 5 khz, digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz and stored on
hard disk for off-line data analysis. all illustrated responses are
averages of four to five consecutive current traces.

results

as expected from previous work, afferent stimulation of
schaffer collaterals in the stratum radiatum of organotypic
slice cultures (stoppini et al. 1991) evoked large currents
reflecting the activation of excitatory and inhibitory
synapses (fig. 1a). these responses were readily inhibited
by application of the ampaïkainate and nmda receptor
antagonists nbqx (5 ìò) and r_cpp (10 ìò) and by the
gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 ìò). note that
gabab-mediated responses were suppressed in these
experiments by addition of qx-314 (5 mò) to the intracellular medium (nathan et al. 1990). surprisingly, however,
we found in a majority of pyramidal neurones in organotypic slice cultures (39 out of 41 cells tested) and in a
smaller proportion of cells in acutely prepared hippocampal
slices (9 out of 16 cells tested) that blockade of excitatory
and inhibitory transmission left a small inward current. in
10 experiments carried out in organotypic cultures in which
the size of this residual current was precisely analysed
during blockade of excitatory and inhibitory transmission, it
corresponded to 2·9 ± 0·4 % (n = 10) of the initial compound
postsynaptic response (10 out of the 10 cells tested exhibited
the residual current; fig. 1a). in acutely prepared slices,
only 9 out of 16 cells tested exhibited this residual current.
in these nine cells, it represented 2·5 ± 0·3 % of the
compound postsynaptic response (n = 9), but 1·4 ± 0·4 %
when considering the 16 cells tested (n = 16). to evoke this
residual current, the stimulation intensity was usually
adjusted so as to evoke a compound postsynaptic current of
approximately 1 na in pyramidal neurones prior to the
application of the blockers. this corresponded to a suprathreshold, but not maximal, stimulation since synaptic
responses of 5—10 na could easily be obtained by increasing
further the stimulation strength.
controls made in organotypic slice cultures showed that
this residual current was unaffected by increasing the
concentrations of the glutamate and gabaa receptor
inhibitors (nbqx, 5 ìò; r_cpp, 20 ìò, bicuculline,
20 ìò; n = 5) or by further addition of cnqx (20 ìò),
ª_ap5 (100 ìò) and  xxxd2947xxx  (100 ìò) to the previous
concentrations of the other inhibitors (fig. 1b; n = 4). the
residual current was therefore insensitive to antagonists of
known glutamate and gaba receptors.
this inward current showed a reversal potential of 3·4 ±
5·1 mv and a current—voltage relationship characterized by
a slight rectification (fig. 2a). a pharmacological analysis
showed that the residual current remained insensitive to

application of  xxxd3266xxx  (50 ìò), atropine (1 ìò) and y_25130
(20 ìò), compounds which are known to block purinergic,
muscarinic and 5-ht×receptors, respectively (data not
shown; cole & nicoll, 1983; edwards et al. 1992; kagami et
al. 1992). also, the current could not be due to the
triggering of fast activating dendritic na¤ channels, since
qx-314 was routinely present in the intracellular medium.
interestingly, however, addition of d_tubocurarine (20 ìò),
a nachr antagonist, to the perfusion medium strongly
reduced this current both in organotypic cultures and slices,
thereby suggesting that it could be attributed to the
activation of nachrs (fig. 2).
to investigate further the nature of the receptor responsible
for the residual current, we then tested the action of various
compounds known to antagonize this class of receptor.
work carried out using both cultured and native hippocampal neurones showed that these cells express different

771

subtypes of neuronal nachrs displaying important
physiological and pharmacological differences (albuquerque
et al. 1997). as shown in fig. 2, bath application of 20 ìò
d_tubocurarine essentially abolished the inward current. in
four experiments on organotypic cultures, d_tubocurarine
blocked the residual current by 91 ± 4 %. similar results
were obtained in six experiments in hippocampal slices. in
an attempt to discriminate between á_bungarotoxin (ábgtx) sensitive and insensitive subtypes, we then tested
the effect of this toxin. addition of 200 nò á-bgtx to the
bath reduced by 48% the amplitude of the residual current
recorded in four organotypic cultures (fig. 3a). in agreement
with previous observations made on á-bgtx sensitive
nachrs, this inhibition was irreversible. the possible
contribution of an á-bgtx sensitive receptor was further
reinforced when examining the effect of methyllycaconitine
(mla), a highly potent nicotinic antagonist. given its 10æ-

as shown, a small current measuring 2·9 ± 0·4 % of the initial cpsc could still be evoked following drug
application (n = 10; the 10 cells tested exhibited the residual current). this residual current was obtained in
39 out of 41 cells in organotypic slice cultures and in 9 out of 16 cells in acutely prepared slices (mean size:
1·4 ± 0·4 %). b, application of additional antagonists of excitatory and inhibitory transmission did not
affect the residual current. the graph shows the results of 3 experiments made on organotypic cultures in
which cnqx (20 ìò), ª_ap5 (100 ìò) and  xxxd2947xxx  (100 ìò) were added to previous concentrations of
nbqx (5 ìò), r_cpp (20 ìò) and bicuculline (20 ìò). data are means ± s.e.m. of the amplitude of the
evoked current. the trace on the right is a representative response recorded in the presence of these

fold higher affinity for subunits of the á7-subtype over other
known nachrs (alkondon et al. 1992), mla can be used as
a pharmacological tool to discriminate between different
ach-evoked currents. we found that addition of 10 nò
mla to five organotypic cultures inhibited by 55% the
residual current and that 80% blockade was reversibly
achieved upon addition of 1 ìò mla to the perfusion
medium (n = 3; fig. 3b and c). similar results were
obtained in three slices. in the light of the high specificity of
both á-bgtx and mla for one of the neuronal nachr
subtypes, these data suggested that á7-containing receptors
were activated and contributed to the fast inward current
response.
several properties of this inward current were indicative of
its synaptic origin (fig. 4). first there was a short delay
(1·8—2·5 ms) between the stimulus artefact and the foot of
its rising phase (fig. 4a). this delay was similar to that of
the compound excitatory synaptic current recorded under
control conditions. second, changing the stimulus intensity
resulted, as expected for synaptic transmission, in a response
that gradually increased up to saturation (fig. 4b). third,
the current was reversibly abolished upon reduction of the
external ca¥ (0·1 mò ca¥—4 mò mg¥), a condition that is
known to block synaptic transmission (fig. 4c). finally,
addition of 100 nò tetrodotoxin reversibly abolished the
evoked current, thereby confirming its dependence upon a
regenerative action potential (fig. 4d).

discussion

the results of the present study provide evidence for the
existence in the hippocampus of a fast synaptic current
evoked by stimulation applied in the stratum radiatum and
mediated by the activation of neuronal nachrs. this
finding is consistent with numerous previous reports
showing the presence in the hippocampus of an important
cholinergic input and the existence, in situ, of choline
acetyltransferase positive cells (frotscher & leranth, 1985;
frotscher et al. 1986; but see oh et al. 1992). it is also
supported by the results of studies indicating that pyramidal
neurones in the rat hippocampus transcribe mrnas encoding
a variety of nachr subunits (conroy et al. 1992; vernallis
et al. 1993) and actually express the corresponding proteins
(alkondon & albuquerque, 1993; albuquerque et al. 1997;
but see frazier et al. 1998). the present study now provides
evidence that, in a significant proportion of pyramidal cells,
afferent stimulation in the strratum radiatum triggers
currents that are generated by activation of nicotinic
receptors. the synaptic origin of this current was established
by the existence of a synaptic delay, its modulation by
graded electrical stimulation, its calcium dependence and its
ttx sensitivity. these data thus provide a new mechanism
for mediating acetylcholine and nicotine actions in this
preparation, in addition to the reported modulation of
glutamate and gaba release (mcgehee et al. 1995; gray et
al. 1996).

an intriguing question arising from this conclusion concerns
the origin of the presynaptic neurones or fibres responsible
for this nicotinic transmission. since schaffer collaterals
are glutamatergic, it is unlikely that the residual current
reported here was directly due to their activation. also,
since the residual current was found in organotypic cultures,

j. physiol. 515.3

a preparation devoid of its extrinsic afferents, this nicotinic
transmission is unlikely to arise from the stimulation of
cholinergic fibres. rather, a more plausible explanation is
that the stimulation pulses directly activated cholinergic
neurones present in the preparation. as suggested by
immunohistochemical analyses (frotscher & leranth, 1985;

nicotinic transmission in hippocampus

frotscher et al. 1986), these neurones are probably present
only in small numbers in hippocampal slices. this may be the
reason why the stimulation pulses used evoked a nicotinic
synaptic current in only about half of the pyramidal cells
tested in hippocampal slices. note that, while these
stimulation pulses were supratheshold for the generation of
action potential in the postsynaptic cell, they were not
maximal, activating probably around 50—200 synapses per
neurone, a situation that may very well occur under
physiological conditions. also the higher proportion of cells
exhibiting the nicotinic current in organotypic cultures
could very well reflect the fact that all dendritic and axonal
processes of neurones remain confined in the culture and
that the level of interconnection between cells is usually
higher in slice cultures (gahwiler et al. 1997).
the pharmacological profile of the synaptic receptor involved
here suggests that á7 or a closely related subunit participates
in the receptor composition responsible for the residual
evoked current. indeed, about 50% of the synaptic nicotinic
current could be blocked by 10 nò mla, a concentration at
which this compound shows a high selectivity for á7containing receptors (alkondon et al. 1992). also, the kinetic
characteristics of this current were fast and therefore
consistent with those of type i currents evoked by acetylcholine application on dissociated pyramidal neurones
(alkondon & albuquerque, 1993; albuquerque et al. 1997).
given the high calcium permeability at resting membrane
potential of the á7 nachr (bertrand et al. 1993; seguela et
al. 1993; albuquerque et al. 1997), one may consider that,
despite the small size of this nicotinic response, it might
generate calcium influx in dendrites and spines and thus
influence ca¥-dependent processes (mulle et al. 1993;
rathouz & berg, 1994). this is in agreement with the
observation that the density of mla-sensitive currents
evoked by acetylcholine application is substantially higher
on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurones than on
the soma (albuquerque et al. 1997). this current could
contribute there to modulate synaptic plasticity, induction
of long-term potentiation or inhibitory mechanisms, and
hence the computational properties of the dendritic tree.
indeed perfusion of nachr agonists was found to facilitate
the induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus
(hunter et al. 1994), illustrating that nicotinic synaptic
transmission may play a role in this form of plasticity.
furthermore, the cholinergic neurones responsible for these
nicotinic synaptic responses could be selectively activated
during specific patterns of activity such as during theta
rhythm and contribute in this way to information processing.
finally the nicotinic transmission found here could also be
modulated by the constant presence of low concentrations of
agonist during nicotine absorption. hence the data presented
here might shed a new light on the possible impact of
neuronal nachrs for cns functions during both physiological and pathological conditions.
