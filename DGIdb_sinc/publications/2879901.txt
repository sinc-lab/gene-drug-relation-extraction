a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model describing receptor-mediated effects ofprednisolone
is presented. the basis of the model is the generally accepted mechanism of action of steroid
hormones in which corticosteroids bind to cytosolic receptors forming steroid-receptor complexes,
which are activated and translocated into the nucleus. there the complexes associate with specific
d n a sequences and modulate the rate of transcription of d n a into specific rnas that code for
the synthesis of proteins that elicit biological responses. prednisolone, 5 m" 50 mg/kg, was
administered intravenously to adrenalectomized rats. total plasma, free plasma, cbg-free plasma,
and liver prednisolone concentrations were measured simultaneously with free hepatic cvtosolic
 xxxg1601xxx  concentrations and  xxxg2250xxx  (tat) activity of the liver
as a function of time. the association/dissociation kinetics of prednisolone binding to the  xxxg1601xxx  were measured separately in vitro at 37~ total plasma, free plasma, and cbg-free
plasma prednisolone concentrations could be used equally well in the model to account for the
time course of receptor concentrations and ta t activity. however, use of liver steroid concentrations
resulted in an overestimation of receptor depletion. steroid concentrations in plasma increased 20
to 30-fold with a tenfold increase in dose, but receptor occupancy and tat activity over time
increased about threefold. while prednisolone pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, parameters
describing receptor kinetics and tat activity were constant at each prednisolone dose. the major
determinants of receptor-mediated glucocorticoid activity are confirmed to be the availability of
the receptor, drug-receptor dissociation rate, and corticosteroid persistence in the biophase.

key words: prednisolone; receptor kinetics;  xxxg2250xxx  (tat).

empirical in nature, these models have been successful in predicting the
onset, intensity, and duration of response to a number of drugs. development of techniques to measure specific receptor binding of drugs has added
another dimension to the analysis of pharmacodynamic data (6). the use
of receptor information allows for a more mechanistic approach to pharmacodynamic modeling, yielding parameters having greater biological
significance.
the presence of high-affinity intracellular binding sites for steroid
hormones was first reported in 1962 (7). glucocorticoids bind to receptors
within the cytoplasm of a cell, forming a steroid-receptor complex, which
is translocated to the nucleus, where it associates with specific regions on
dna (fig. 1). steroid receptors then modulate the rate of transcription of
dns into rnas that code for synthesis of proteins responsible for eliciting
a biological response. this classical receptor-mediated mechanism of steroid
hormone action explains the delayed onset and prolonged duration observed
with many corticosteroid-induced effects (8-10). the time course of induction of the hepatic enzyme  xxxg2250xxx  (tat) is one such
classical receptor-mediated effect (l 1).
in the preceding paper, we examined the pharmacokinetics of
prednisolone in the rat at two dose levels. the purpose of this report is to
develop a receptor-mediated glucocorticoid pharmacodynamic model by
simultaneously measuring total plasma, free plasma, transcortin-free
plasma, and liver prednisolone concentrations, in conjunction with hepatic
cytosolic receptor concentrations and steroid response (tyrosine
aminotransferase activity) as a function of time after intravenous
prednisolone. a secondary purpose of this study was to assess whether use
of these various biological substrates affected the modeling of prednisolone
dynamics. low and high steroid doses were administered to rats to assess
the effects of dose and nonlinear pharmacokinetics on the time course of
biological response.
theoretical
the receptor-mediated mechanism of action of glucocorticoid hormones has been extensively reviewed and is shown in fig. 1 (8-12). free
steroid diffusing from plasma and within the cell binds reversibly to an
oligomeric phosphoprotein cytosolic receptor, forming a steroid-receptor
complex. through a process termed activation, presumably dissociation
and dephosphorylation of the receptor, this complex is rapidly transformed
to an activated steroid-receptor form. activation of the steroid-receptor
complex enables it to translocate rapidly into the cell nucleus. association

receptor complex result in a depletion of free cytosotic receptor concentrations. in the cell nucleus the activated steroid-receptor complex associates
in a sequence- or conformation-specific manner to chromatin. this binding
takes place in or near the promotor region of regulated genes, thereby
changing the rate of transcription. in this manner glucocorticoids modulate
mrna concentrations and subsequently affect synthesis of proteins such
as enzymes ( xxxg2250xxx ), structural proteins (collagen),
"housekeeping" proteins (metallothionein), membrane hormone receptors
( xxxg1194xxx ), secretory proteins (casein), anti-inflammatory inhibitors
of prostaglandins (13) (macrocortin), and hormones (somatotrophin) that
ultimately elicit the observed steroid response. cytosolic receptor concentrations are restored by the dissociation of steroid-receptor complexes and
nuclear bound receptor. in addition, de novo synthesis of receptor replaces
degraded receptor. the recycled or newly synthesized cytosolic receptor is
biologically active and can associate with free steroid and subsequently
with dna, producing an increased effect.

much of the work done to elucidate the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids has been done employing the rat liver. this organ contains a
relatively high concentration of glucocorticoid receptors (14). in addition,
corticosteroid responses in the liver, such as the induction of hepatic
enzymes, particularly  xxxg2250xxx  (tat), are well defined
and easy to measure. the induction of tat is a transcriptional effect that
serves as an ideal prototype corticosteroid response. the time course of
tat activity is representative of that of other typical corticosteroid
responses, such as blood histamine levels, white blood cell counts (15),
forced expiratory lung volume (16), and carageenin-induced inflammation
(17), in that the appearance of these effects is preceded by a lag time
following steroid administration, maximum responses occur hours after
peak steroid concentrations are observed, and effects dissipate slowly.
prednisolone concentrations c in plasma (total, free, and cbg-free)
and in liver declined in a triexponential fashion after intravenous steroid
injection (figs. 3 and 4) and can be described by the equation

c = cle-al'+ c2e-~2'+ c3e-x3'

(1)

where the ai are slope values, the ci are ordinate intercepts, and t is time.
differentiation of eq. (1) yields an equation describing the rate of change
of drug concentration in terms of a; and ci:

dc
--=-a,c,e
dt

alt-a2c2e a2'-a3c3e-aj

(2)

with the initial condition that co is equal to the sum of the intercept terms
(i.e., co = ~ c~). these equations were employed in the model to describe
the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone and delivery of the steroid to the
biophase. since the role of plasma protein binding in determining availability of the corticosteroid is of interest, the model was examined to test
whether total drug in plasma cp, free drug in plasma cv, cbg-free drug
ccuc-rree, or total liver concentration cl best describes steroid equilibration
with free drug at the receptor site (d) and subsequent events.
a parsimonious pharmacodynamic model describing the time course
of the steroid-receptor binding, dna interaction, and induction of tat is
shown in fig. 2. prednisolone within the cell (d) binds to free cytosolic
receptor (r) with an association rate constant kon to form the steroid receptor
complex. this complex is rapidly and virtually completely converted to the
activated form. the activated steroid-receptor complex is then rapidly
translocated into the nucleus (18,19), where it remains unbound, binds
nonspecifically to nuclear material, or binds to specific sites on d na (20,21).
dissociation of the nonspecifically bound complex and transfer of the free
complex back to the cytosol are also extremely rapid (22,23). thus, activated

represents free steroid concentrations in the liver; r, dr*, and drn represent free cytosolic
receptor, activated steroid-receptor complex, and steroid-receptor complex bound specifically
to dna; and tat represents  xxxg2250xxx  activity. the rate constants are: kon
and kofr, association and dissociation rates of steroid and receptor; kdna,association rate for
the binding of the activated steroid-receptor complex to specific sites on dna; krep, rate of
replenishment of the cytosolic receptor; k-rat, rate of induction of tat; kale, dissipation of
tat activity. tl represents the time lag preceding the induction of tat and ef is the efficacy
factor relating tat to drn.

steroid-receptor complex in the cytosol and nucleus can be considered a
single complex, dr*. this complex either dissociates with rate constant
ko~ or binds to specific sites on dna (drn) with first-order rate constant
kdna. chromatin-bound receptor dissociates and free receptor returns to
the cytosol. in addition, de novo synthesis of receptor replaces degraded
receptor. for simplicity, recycling and degradation and de novo resynthesis
of cytosolic receptors are described by a single zeroth-order rate constant
krep.

the rates of change of the three forms of  xxxg1601xxx  viz
r, dr*, and drn can be described by the following differential equations:
d ( r ) / d t = -kon(d)(r) + koff(dr*) + krep
d(dr*)/dt = ko.(d)(r) - (ko~+ kdna)(dr*)
d ( d r n ) / d t = kdna(dr* )

(3)

(5)

with initial conditions of r0 equaling total cytosolic receptor concentration
in the absence of steroid, while dro* and drn0 equal zero. equation (5)
describes only the formation of drn and is used to determine the initial
cumulative number of steroid-receptor complexes that bind to dna. dissociation of drn must occur, but regeneration of r is embodied separately
in kre p .
binding of the activated steroid-receptor complex to specific regions
on dna initiates the transcription of mrnatar, which codes for the

boudinot, d'ambrosio, and jusko

474

translation of tat. as a result of these obligatory steps the induction of
this enzyme is preceded by a lag period tl. induction of tat is a zerothorder process (24,25) described with rate constant ktav and a duration of
induction ts. it was initially found by calculation that d r n rapidly achieves
maximum values during the lag period and there is a direct proportionality
between cumulative d r n values and tat activity. for ease of application,
we utilized drnrnax [from eq. (5)], the cumulative maximum number of
receptors complexed with d n a to generate /ca-at, from drnmax/ts.
 xxxg2250xxx  activity is assumed to be directly proportional
to d r n with efficacy factor ei. this parameter was given units to allow
transformation from d r n values to tat activity with correct dimensional
results. enzyme activity declines in a monoexponential fashion (24) with
rate constant kae. thus, tat activity following prednisolone can be
described using an equation analogous to a zeroth-order infusion/first-order
elimination function:
tat = tato-~

ktat"
ef [ekd~(tztl)-- l i e -kd*(t-tl)

(6)

where ts = t at t -< ts and ts = constant at t > ts, and all time values equal
zero at t <- tl. also, tato is baseline tat activity in the absence of steroid.
materials and m e t h o d s

animals
adrenalectomized male wistar rats weighing from 125 to 150 g were
purchased from charles river (boston, ma). animals were housed in a
12 hr light/12 hr dark, constant-temperature (22~ environment with free
access to rat chow (agway r m h 1000) and a 0.9%  xxxg2020xxx  drinking solution.
animals were acclimatized to this environment for 1 week. on the day
before the study, rats were subjected to external jugular vein cannulation
u n d e r light ether anesthesia. food was removed 16hr before each
experiment.

experimental
rats (32-38 animals per dose) received either 5 or 50mg/kg
prednisolone as the sodium succinate salt (sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo) administered intravenously in 0.3 ml of normal saline over 30 sec into
the jugular vein cannula. at various times after steroid administration (see
figs. 3 and 4), rats were sacrificed and blood was drained from the abdominal
aortic artery into a heparinized syringe. blood was immediately centrifuged,
and plasma was harvested and frozen at -20~ until assayed. after blood

drainage, the liver was rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold saline. a
pol"fion of the tissue was immediately dropped in liquid nitrogen, wrapped
in aluminium foil, and frozen at -20~ until analysis for steroids.
drug assays

serum and liver prednisolone concentrations were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography as previously described (26,27). briefly,
1 ml of plasma with dexamethasone internal standard added was extracted
into 15 ml methylene chloride. the organic phase was evaporated to dryness
under nitrogen gas and reconstituted with mobile phase for injection.
samples were chromatographed on a waters associates hplc system
employing a dupont zorbax sil column with a mobile phase of methylene
chloride-heptane- xxxd102xxx acetic acid (60.0:35.0:3.6:1.0) at a flow rate of
2.0 ml/min.
tissue samples (0.5 g) were added to ice-cold saline, rapidly homogenized while surrounded with ice, using a polytron tissue homogenizer.
prednisolone in 1.0 ml of the homogenate was immediately extracted into
methylene chloride. tissue samples were then assayed for prednisolone as
described above. standard curves were prepared in plasma by spiking
plasma (previously treated with charcoal to remove endogenous steroids)
with various concentrations of prednisolone. previous studies have demonstrated parallel extraction of dexamethasone and prednisolone from plasma
and liver (27).
plasma protein binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis (28).
least-squares estimates of transcortin and albumin binding capacities and
affinities for prednisolone were generated by the computer method of priore
and rosenthal (29). free and cbg-free plasma concentrations of
prednisolone in vivo were calculated for given plasma steroid concentrations
using the computer-generated protein binding parameters.
cytosolic  xxxg1601xxx 

cytosolic  xxxg1601xxx  concentrations were determined by
standard techniques (14,18). liver was homogenized in six volumes of
ice-cold 50 mm tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.5) containing 10 mmole of sodium
molybdate and 2.5 mmole of edta per liter with a polytron tissue
homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged in a precooled batch rotor
at 78,000 g for 10 min at 4~ in a beckman airfuge ultracentrifuge (beckman instruments, palo alto, ca). the clear cytosol was treated with l/10
volumes dextran-coated charcoal (0.5-5%) in the  xxxd3449xxx  at 4~ and
centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min at 4~ to remove free steroids. aliquots
(75/xl) of the cytosol were incubated with 1-10onm 3h dexamethasone

476

boudinot, d'ambrosio, and jusko

(41 ci/mmole) in the presence (nonspecific binding) and absence (total
binding) of 500 fold excess unlabeled dexamethasone at 4~ for 16 hr in
microtiter plates. twenty microliters was placed in scintillation vials for the
determination of total radioactivity. following incubation, unbound steroids
were removed by adding 25/xl of ice-cold dextran-coated charcoal and
centrifuging at 3000 g for 15 min at 4~ the supernatant (75/xl) was placed
in scintillation vials, 5 ml of scintillation cocktail was added, and radioactivity was determined with a packard liquid scintillation counter. counting
efficiency was determined using the external standard ratio technique (30).
total receptor binding was determined in cytosols incubated in the absence
of excess unlabeled steroid, while nonspecific binding was determined in
the presence of excess steroid. all determinations were done in triplicate.
total binding dbt of 3h-dexamethasone in cytosol can be described by
dbr = dns -~

ofbmax
dv + kd

(7)

where dv is the concentration of unbound 3h-dexamethasone, bma x is the
concentration of specific receptor binding sites, kd is the equilibrium
dissociation constant for the 3h-dexamethasone-specific receptor interaction, and dus is nonspecific binding. nonspecific binding, measured in the
presence of excess unlabeled dexamethasone, can be described by
dns =

(nkp)ns * dv

(8)

where (nkp)ns is the number of binding sites n, association constant k,
and concentration p of the nonspecific binding proteins. least-squares
estimates of kd and bma x w e r e generated by simultaneous fitting of total
and nonspecific binding data to eqs. (7) and (8) (31), using the nonlin
computer program (32). concentrations of free receptor (r) were calculated
by normalizing bn~axfor the weight of tissue protein used in the determination of receptor binding.
receptor kinetics at 37~

the equilibrium dissociation constant kd and the dissociation rate
constant ko~ for prednisolone binding to the liver cytosolic receptor were
measured in vitro at 37~ the ko~ was also determined for dexamethasone
for comparison with literature values. cytosol for the receptor kinetic
experiments was prepared at 4~ as described above. for determination of
kd, 75/m of cytosol was incubated with 3-500nm 3h-prednisolone
(60 ci/mmole) in the presence and absence of 500-fold excess unlabeled
prednisolone at 37~ for 0.5 hr in microtiter plates. following incubation,
plates were placed on ice for 5 rain. ice-cold dextran-coated charcoal was

477

added to remove unbound steroid. for the remainder of the assay, the
receptor methodology described above was followed. two experiments were
performed in triplicate for the determination of kd at 37~ the equilibrium
dissociation constant was generated using total and nonspecific binding
data with eqs. (7) and (8).
dissociation rate constants were determined as follows. cytosol (2.5 ml)
with 25 and 500 nm 3h-prednisolone or 50 nm 3h-dexamethasone in the
presence and absence of 500-fold excess unlabeled steroid was incubated
at 4~ for 3 hr. then 10/xm ice-cold unlabeled prednisolone or 2/xm
unlabeled dexamethasone was added to tubes containing 3h-steroid only
and equal volume of ice-cold buffer was added to tubes with 3h-steroid in
the presence of excess unlabeled drug. aliquots of cytosol were removed
from each tube for measurement of total and nonspecific binding at time
zero. tubes were then placed in a shaker-water bath at 37~ aliquots were
removed from each tube at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min and immediately placed
on ice. ice-cold dextran-coated charcoal was added to the cooled cytosols,
followed by centrifugation. radioactivity in the supernatant was counted
for determination of total and nonspecific binding. experiments were performed in triplicate.
specific receptor binding was calculated from the difference of total
binding and nonspecific binding. the natural logarithm of the amount of
3h-steroid bound to specific receptor sites was plotted as a function of time
with the least-squares linear regression slope generating ko~. the association
rate constant kon was calculated from the quotient of koer and kd.
 xxxg2250xxx  activity

 xxxg2250xxx  (tat) activity was determined by the
method of diamondstone (33). absorbances were measured at a 331 nm
wavelength with a perkin elmer double-beam spectrophotometer. results
were expressed as aa331/min per mg protein. tissue protein was determined
by the method of lowry et al. (34).
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
pharmacokinetics

plasma (cp), free plasma (cf), cbg-free plasma (ccbg.free), and liver
(cl) prednisolone concentrations as a function of time were fitted by
nonlin least-squares regression (32) to eq. (1). prednisolone disposition
can also be described by eq. (2), which was used for simulation purposes
employing ci and ai values previously generated.

receptor dynamics
free cytosolic receptor concentrations as a function of time can be
described by eq. (3). the receptor data for each steroid dose were analyzed
using eqs. (2)-(5) simultaneously in the computer program nonlin (32),
using calculated prednisolone concentrations for d [eq. (2)]. to determine
which prednisolone concentrations best describe the steroid concentration
at the receptor site, free receptor concentrations [eq. (3)] were fitted using
total plasma, free plasma, cbg-free plasma, or liver prednisolone concentrations [eq. (2)]. values of kon and ko~ determined in vitro were
employed as constants and least-squares estimates of kre p and kdn a w e r e
generated. cumulative drn values were calculated using eq. (5). these
values reflect the total number of steroid-receptor complexes that bind to
specific regions on dna producing a pharmacological response.

 xxxg2250xxx  activity
 xxxg2250xxx  activities as a function of time were fitted
by nonlin least-squares regression (32) to eq. (6). such data from the high
and low doses of prednisolone were fitted simultaneously. since initial
analysis demonstrated that tl, el, and kde were independent of the dose,
values common to tat data at both doses were produced. using drn
values obtained from the receptor portion of the pharmacodynamic model,
estimates of ts, tl, el, and kale were generated for each dose.
results
pharmacokinetics

figures 3 and 4 show the total plasma, free plasma, cbg-free plasma,
and liver prednisolone concentrations as a function of time following
intravenous prednisolone doses of 5 and 50mg/kg. each of these
prednisolone concentrations was fitted best to a triexponential equation
[eq. (1)]. congruent prednisolone pharmacokinetics in the group of rats
is confirmed by the lack of substantial interrat variability. the pharmacokinetic parameters describing the disposition of prednisolone after 5and 50-mg/kg doses are presented in tables i and ii.
a marked dose dependence in prednisolone pharmacokinetics is
evidenced by the greater than proportional increases in prednisolone concentrations with dose. total plasma, free plasma, cbg-free plasma, and
liver steroid concentrations are approximately 30-fold higher after the
50-mg/kg dose than after 5-mg/kg prednisolone. the areas under the
prednisolone versus time curves show similar greater than proportional
increases with dose. slope values in the various biophases and after the
two doses, however, are similar.

levels in a biphasic manner. the rapid phase of receptor replenishment

discussion
the purpose of this pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was to
describe in a quantitative manner the major biological processes that lead
to a glucocorticoid-induced response. the present communication is the
result of modeling efforts using simultaneously measured prednisolone

receptor-mediated effects of prednisolone

485

concentrations, receptor concentrations, and tat activity after the
administration of two dose levels of prednisolone to rats. the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone is defined, allowing for more precise estimates of
pharmacodynamic parameters.
prednisolone pharmacokinetics

prednisolone pharmacokinetics in individual rats is described in detail
in the preceding paper (35). the present study required composite data
from 32-38 animals per dose because of the need to obtain livers for receptor
and tat measurements. the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in the rat
in the present study was dose-dependent, with values for systematic clearance after 5 and 50 mg/kg prednisolone of 5.2 and 1.6 l/hr per kg. results
from the two studies are similar. the plasma protein binding parameters
obtained in the present study are also similar to those reported in the
preceding paper. thus, the time course ofprednisolone cp, cf, and ccb~_fr~
concentrations found compositely mimic those seen in individual animals.
most experimental evidence indicates that corticosteroid entry into
mammalian cells and tissues occurs by passive diffusion, while accumulation
within cells reflects binding to intracellular proteins. plagemann and erbe
(36), examining the initial rates of prednisolone uptake by cultured rat
hepatoma cells, showed that intraceltular steroid concentrations were proportional to extracellular concentrations over a wide range of corticosteroid
concentrations. in addition, large excesses of other glucocorticoids, depletion of cellular atp, or modification of the cell surface did not affect the
rate of prednisolone uptake. pardridge and mietus (37) also demonstrated
a nonsaturable transport of cortisol and other steroid hormones into rat
liver in situ. several studies have suggested active transport mechanisms for
steroid uptake (38,39); however, the results of these studies can also be
explained by intracellular protein binding (40). indeed, the presence of
saturable binding sites of lower affinity and higher capacity than the highaffinity  xxxg1601xxx  have been demonstrated in mouse fibroblasts
(40), rabbit liver (41), and rat skeletal muscle (42)~the nonlinear disposition
of prednisolone in the rat liver as well as the long terminal phase of steroid
disposition (figs. 3 and 4) probably reflect saturable binding to glucocorticoid receptors and other intracellular proteins.
induction of the hepatic enzyme  xxxg2250xxx  is initiated
by the association of a corticosteroid with the  xxxg1601xxx  in
the cell cytosol. glucocorticoid concentrations at this site of action are not
directly measurable (our initial efforts failed). typically, free plasma drug
concentrations are assumed to be biologically active by virtue of rapid
equilibration with receptor sites. however, there is controversy regarding

486

boudinot, d'ambrosio, and jusko

the role of plasma protein binding in corticosteroid pharmacodynamics.
slaunwhite et al. (43) showed that liver glycogen content in adrenatectomized mice increased after corticol injection, whereas injection of partially
purified transcortin followed by cortisol failed to increase glycogen levels.
in a similar experiment, transcortin decreased the release of acth in
response to histamine in rats (44). thyroxin-induced increases in plasma
transcortin concentrations in rats have been shown to result in substantially
decreased liver uptake and clearance of corticosterone (45). lippman and
thompson (46) examined the effect of rat serum on corticosteroid induction
of tat in cultured hepatoma tissue cells. these investigators found that
the addition of rat serum to the culture medium caused a decreased uptake
of cortisol by the hepatoma culture cells and a decreased induction of tat
by cortisol. induction of the enzyme by dexamethasone, which is not bound
by transcortin, was virtually unaffected by the addition of rat serum.
in contrast, rosner (47) injected adrenalectomized rats with cortisol
alone or cortisol with purified rat transcortin and found similar tat
activities and peripheral blood lymphocyte concentrations in both treatment
groups. these results suggest that transcortin-bound cortisol is biologically
active. in addition, pardrige and mietus (37) found that both albumin- and
cbg-bound corticosteroids are readily transported into the rat liver.
few studies have examined the physiological activity of albumin-bound
corticosteroids. these studies have generally indicated that steroid bound
to albumin is biologically inactive. lewis et al. (48) demonstrated a correlation between the frequency of side effects in patients receiving prednisolone
and decreased  xxxg124xxx  concentrations. ballard (49) showed that the
nuclear uptake of steroids at 37~ by a549 cells (derived from human lung
carcinoma) decreases with increasing albumin concentration.
total plasma, free plasma, cbg-free plasma, and liver prednisolone
concentrations were measured in an attempt to discern which of these
substrates best describe the steroid interaction with the glucocorticoid
receptor. liver prednisolone concentrations did not correlate with cytosolic
receptor dynamics after either 5 or 50 mg/kg prednisolone dosing, producing
an overestimation of the duration of receptor depletion. liver prednisolone
concentrations are higher at later times than plasma steroid concentrations.
this suggests that accumulation of prednisolone in the liver is due to the
binding of the steroid to glucocorticoid receptors and tissue proteins rather
than accumulation of free steroid resulting from an active transport process.
indeed, the long terminal phase of prednisolone disposition can be
accounted for in part by the high-affinity receptor binding of the steroid.
binding of prednisolone to other tissue proteins probably also contributes
to this phenomenon. thus, steroid that is bound to proteins within the cell
is not available to the receptor and therefore not biologically active. only

receptor-mediated effects of prednisolone

487

unbound steroid in the cell cytosol would appear to be available to associate
with the cytosolic receptor. total plasma, free plasma, and cbg-free plasma
prednisolone concentrations could be used equally well to predict receptor
dynamics and tat activity.
receptor dynamics

the receptor portion of the pharmacodynamic model (fig. 2) simplifies
the complex molecular events which occur within the cell. we have
attempted to describe the major processes involving the receptor, namely
association and dissociation of the steroid-receptor complex, association
of the steroid-receptor complex with specific sites on dna, and receptor
regeneration. the association rate constant found for the prednisolonereceptor interaction (0.24 nm -1 hr -l) is very similar to the values of 0.15
and 0.48 nm -1 hr ~ reported for cortisol binding to receptors in thymus
cells at 37~ by munck and brink-johnsen (50). the value for kon was
calculated from kd/ko,. values measured for kd and ko, are consistent
with previous results obtained for dexamethasone and cortisol (11). the
rate of activation is extremely rapid in rat liver (18) and thymus cells (19);
consequently, the ratio of activated to unactivated complexes is high. hence,
it was assumed that association of steroid with the receptor and activation
of the receptor were inseparable in the time domain of the model with a
kon of 0.24 nm -1 hr -1. although association and activation are most likely
more complicated than this, for the purposes of the pharmacodynamic
model this assumption was effective.
the activated steroid-receptor complex dr* rapidly equilibrates
between the cytosol and nucleus (22,23), with approximately 60% of the
activated receptors being located in the nucleus (23,51). the ratio of nuclear
to cytosolic activated complexes appears to be independent of the steroid.
translocation of dr* to and from the nucleus is very rapid (23,52), so that
the activated complex in the cytosol and nucleus can be considered one
form of the receptor for initial modeling purposes. therefore, the translocation step was neglected in the model, and dr* represents activated steroidreceptor complexes in both the cytosol and nucleus. it was also assumed
for these reasons that all dr* complexes had equal chances of binding
specifically to dna. this binding of activated steroid receptor complexes
to specific regions on dna promotes transcription of rnas (20,21). current
knowledge concerning the number of specific nuclear sites or the kinetics
of activated receptor-dna interaction is limited; however, the specific
binding capacity appears to exceed the cytosolic receptor content and thus
is not saturable (51). therefore, for simplicity the association of dr* and
dna was taken to be a first-order reaction.

488

boudinot, d'ambrosio, and jusko

the dna binding rate constant kdna was the only receptor kinetic
constant that was altered by the use of different biophase prednisolone
concentrations (table iii) in eqs. (3)-(5). nearly identical curve fittings
of the free cytosolic receptor data (fig. 5) were obtained using plasma, free
plasma, or cbg-free plasma steroid concentrations. the kdna value compensated by decreasing with high prednisolone concentrations (cp) and
increasing with lower concentrations (cf). indeed, the ratio of kdnavalues
for each biophase steroid concentration was similar to the ratio of the area
under the prednisolone versus time curves. the ratios of a uccbg.free/a ucp
and aucfree/aucp averaged 1.1 and 2.5, while the ratios of kdna values
for ccbg.rree/ cp and cf/cp averaged 1.4 and 1.9. interestingly, the kdna
values obtained using each biophase steroid concentration yielded similar
drn values (table iii). thus, it was not possible to discern which of these
prednisolone concentrations might actually best reflect steroid interaction
with receptor. this was due in part to the relatively low fractional binding
of prednisolone to rat plasma proteins, particularly to transcortin. free
prednisolone concentrations can vary tenfold with steroid concentration in
man, while only a twofold change was observed in the rat. oosterhuis et
al. (4), using a threshold concentration ema• model to describe the pharmacodynamics of prednisolone-induced lymphocytopenia in man, also were
unable to determine whether total or free steroid represented the biologically
active species.
replenishment of the cytosolic receptor is biphasic (fig. 5), suggesting
the involvement of two separate mechanisms. the more rapid phase is
attributed to the dissociation of the steroid-receptor complex. it has been
demonstrated that the first-order rates of steroid dissociation from activated
and unactivated receptor complexes are essentially identical (53-55). the
rate constants found for the dissociation of prednisolone (14.7 hr -1) and
dexamethasone (7.2 hr -~) receptor complexes are in agreement with those
measured at 37~ for cortisol (25.8 hr -~) and dexamethasone (9.0 hr -1) by
bell and munck (53) in rat thymus cells and for dexamethasone (3.2 hr 1)
by koblinsky et al. (56) in rat liver. the rapid phase of cytosolic receptor
replenishment is not seen after the higher prednisolone dose, since essentially all of the primary receptors were bound to dna due to the higher
and more sustained steroid concentrations after the 50 mg/kg dose.
the slower phase of receptor return appears to represent the regeneration of cytosolic receptors that were bound specifically to dna or that were
degraded. the mechanisms involved in the regeneration of these receptors
have not been fully elucidated; however, at least two mechanisms have been
proposed. recycling of receptors may occur (57-59), whereby the receptor
dissociates from nuclear binding sites and subsequently returns to the
cytosol. alternatively, receptor may be degraded, with synthesis of new

receptor-mediated effects of prednisolone

489

receptor required for regeneration (60). regardless of the mechanism of
receptor regeneration, the overall process can be described as a zeroth-order
reaction. this is consistent with observations that an energy-dependent step
is required for receptor recycling (57-59) or de novo resynthesis (60). this
slow receptor regeneration process was operable at a constant rate of
2.65 nm/hr immediately following receptor depletion and until cytosolic
receptor concentrations returned to baseline levels.
the simplified receptor portion of the glucocorticoid pharmacodynamic
model describes the depletion and regeneration of free cytosolic receptor
after 5 and 50 mg/kg prednisolone (fig. 5) quite well. although a number
of assumptions were made concerning the steroid-receptor interaction, they
did not appear to weaken the basic integrity of the model. the model
suggests that total liver prednisotone concentrations are not those that
interact with the receptor; however, it was unable to discriminate whether
total plasma, free plasma, or cbg-free plasma prednisolone concentrations
best define the active steroid. these steroid concentrations could be used
to describe the receptor data equally well and yielded similar drn values.
induction of tyrosone aminotransferase

induction of the liver enzyme  xxxg2250xxx  is generally
believed to be a transcriptional effect. binding of the glucocorticoid-receptor
complex to specific regions of dna leads to an increased mrnavat activity
in the liver and increased synthesis of tat and finally increased enzyme
activity (24,25). these series of steps result in a lag period (1.7 hr) preceding
any increase in tat activity. the drn values determined with the receptor
portion of the pharmacodynamic model (table iii) reflect the number of
steroid-receptor complexes that bind specifically to dna and serve as the
input for tat induction.
the induction of tat is a zeroth-order process (24) with a similar rate
of enzyme induction (7.8 nm/hr) after high and low doses of prednisolone.
the efficacy factor (et =48.0), which relates the calculated drn values
and tat activity, was also identical after both steroid doses, illustrating
that the receptor model is successfully united with the effect model. we
have also found that the efficacy factor for dexamethasone pharmacodynamics is identical to that for prednisolone (61). thus, once bound
specifically in the nucleus, glucocorticoids produce identical effects with
receptor and prereceptor events controlling the time course of activity.
 xxxg2250xxx  activity declined in a first-order fashion with
a kde of 0.40 hr -1. following the administration of dexamethasone, tat
activity declines at a slower rate than after prednisolone due to the slower
elimination rate of the former (61).

490

boudinot, d'ambrosio, and jusko

the glucocorticoid p h a r m a c o d y n a m i c model presented here very well
describes the depletion and replenishment of the cytosolic receptor and the
induction of  xxxg2250xxx . while the model is an over simplification of the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, it appears to be
biochemically sound. this model successfully accounts for the time course
of tat activity from plasma prednisolone concentrations. all receptor
kinetic and p h a r m a c o d y n a m i c parameters are constant with the two steroid
doses. thus, changes in the time course of tat activity after various
prednisolone doses result entirely from the pharmacokinetics of the steroid
interfaced with limited receptor concentrations.
these results explain the lack of dose proportionality in the clinical
use and elicitation of receptor-mediated glucocorticoid effects. the tenfold
increase in prednisolone dose produced a 20- to 30-fold increase in plasma
corticosteroid concentrations, but receptor occupancy over time increased
only 3.1-fold, d n a - b o u n d receptor increased only 2-fold, and tat response
over time increased only 3.4-fold. the major rate-limiting step in glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics is thus the availability of receptor with modulation related to the steroid-receptor dissociation rate and pharmacokinetic
persistence of the steroid in the biophase.
the present model is applicable in principle to a variety of receptormediated corticosteroid effects in man, including changes in blood histamine
(15), blood white cell counts (15), bronchodilation (16), and anti-inflammatory effects (13,62). the time course of these pharmacological effects is
similar to tat activity with steroid dosing followed by a lag phase, progressive induction of the effect, slow dissipation of the response beyond the
duration of plasma steroid concentrations, and dose nonproportionality.
however, other regulatory, permissive, and amplication effects of corticosteroids also exist (62), which add further complications in considering
the diverse biochemical and pharmacological effects of these drugs.
