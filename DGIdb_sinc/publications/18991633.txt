abstract: cushing’s syndrome is a rare disease with significant morbidity and mortality. surgical intervention represents
the most effective treatment option in both  xxxg1801xxx -dependent and –independent forms of hypercortisolism. it
is not uncommon, however, that surgery fails to cure or control the disease. pharmacotherapy with drugs inhibiting steroid
biosynthesis can be effectively used in these cases in order to alleviate symptoms or even to induce chemical adrenalectomy. a few drugs inhibiting single or multiple steps in adrenal steroid biosynthesis can be used in clinical practice. drugs
predominantly inhibiting single enzymatic steps include the 11-hydroxylase inhibitor  xxxd2633xxx  and the 3hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor  xxxd3436xxx , whereas  xxxd2656xxx ,  xxxd147xxx , ketoconazole and etomidate
block multiple enzymatic reactions. etomidate is the only agent available for parenteral administration that renders it as a
treatment of choice in critically ill patients requiring a rapid control of hypercortisolemia. ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx  and
 xxxd147xxx  can be used alone or in combination for the treatment of hypercortisolism caused by benign  xxxg1801xxx - or cortisol-secreting tumors. the clinical utility of  xxxd3436xxx  is variable. besides blocking multiple steps in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, the ddt (insecticide) analogue  xxxd2656xxx  also has adrenolytic properties by inducing mitochondrial degeneration that renders it superior to other drugs in the treatment of adrenocortical cancer. severe side effects may
develop during therapy with each aforementioned drug that include hepatic, endocrine and neurological toxicity. after
summarizing the chemical and biological properties of steroid biosynthetic inhibitors, the authors describe their possible
clinical applications and limitations.

introduction
cushing’s syndrome (hypercortisolism) is a rare disease
(incidence: 0.7-2.4 per million population per year) with
significant morbidity and mortality [1]. hypercortisolism
may develop in both  xxxg1801xxx  (acth)-dependent
and independent settings with the same clinical symptoms
and complications (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
osteoporosis, impaired wound healing, infections etc.).
acth-dependent forms of cushing’s syndrome include
acth-secreting pituitary adenoma (cushing’s disease) and
ectopic acth syndrome, whereas cortisol-secreting adrenal
adenoma, adrenocortical cancer, the rare acth-independent
macronodular adrenal hyperplasia and primary pigmented
nodular adrenal disease constitute the other group [1].
surgical intervention represents the most effective and
often the only curative treatment option in these diseases by
removing the source of acth or cortisol overproduction. in
some cases, however, surgical intervention is not successful
or not feasible, and therefore alternative treatment protocols
must be implemented. pharmacotherapy with steroid biosynthesis inhibiting drugs is an efficient way of alleviating clinical symptoms related to hypercortisolism and in some cases
even to induce chemical adrenalectomy. the steroid biosynthesis inhibiting drug  xxxd2656xxx  is regarded as a treatment of
choice in patients with adrenocortical cancer, since it can
hamper tumor progression and metastasis development, as
well. steroid biosynthesis inhibiting drugs may be applied

either as a temporary measure prior to definitive treatment or
for longer term in patients who are unwilling or unfit to
undergo surgery. pharmacotherapy can be helpful in patients
with acth-secreting pituitary tumors while waiting for the
curative effect of pituitary radiotherapy, which can take up to
10 years or even more [2].
in addition to the inhibitors of steroid biosynthesis, other
drugs can also be applied in the pharmacotherapy of acthdependent hypercortisolism. serotonin antagonists,  xxxg656xxx  agonists, somatostatin analogues and thiazolidinediones act via the suppression of pituitary acthsecretion [3, 4]. the combination of novel dopamine d2
receptor agonists and somatostatin analogues appears to be
very promising, even chimeric molecules binding both the
type 5 somatostatin receptor and the  xxxg656xxx 
are being developed. specific receptor-blocking agents capable of suppressing cortisol secretion may be used in the
pharmacotherapy of some forms of the rare acthindependent bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, as
these often express receptors that are normally absent from
or weakly expressed in the adrenal cortex (e.g. vasopressin,
gastric inhibitory polypeptide, -adrenergic receptors) [3].
steroid biosynthesis inhibitors include inhibitors of both
single and multiple enzymatic reactions. steroid hormone
biosynthesis involves mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome p450 enzymes (cyps) containing heme prosthetic
groups at their active sites [5]. being hydrophobic membrane-associated proteins not amenable to standard crystallization techniques, the crystal structures of these enzymes are
not known, and therefore the molecular mechanisms of substrate and steroid inhibitor binding and action are only poorly
elucidated. the availaible information on the interactions

with steroid biosynthesis inhibitors is largely inferred from
studies using homology modeling.
six molecules are used in clinical practice at present. it is
of interest to note that several of these drugs were first tested
in other diseases, and the recognition of their severe sideeffects related to adrenocortical insufficiency resulted in
their subsequent introduction to the therapy of hypercortisolism. steroid biosynthesis inhibitors are associated with
many side-effects that include dermatological, hepatic,
gastrointestinal, neurological and endocrine toxicity. as the
inhibition of steroid biosynthesis is often difficult to control,
adrenocortical insufficiency may develop in some patients
warranting the introduction of steroid substitution (mainly
with hydrocortisone). compensatory increase in acthsecretion due to steroid biosynthesis blockade is also frequently observed, that explains some escape phenomena and
the necessity of increasing therapeutical doses [4].
in the following, the chemical properties, in vitro and in
vivo activities, side effects and clinical application of these
substances will be discussed.
single enzyme inhibitors
 xxxd2633xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx  are considered as predominant
inhibitors of single enzymatic steps in steroidogenesis, however, both are known to influence other enzymatic reactions,
as well. fig. (1) represents the scheme of steroid biosynthesis
with the enzymatic steps influenced by steroid biosynthesis
inhibitors.
 xxxd2633xxx 
2-metyl-1,2-bis-[3-piridyl]-1-propanone
( xxxd2633xxx ,
fig. (2)), a pyridine derivative was first used as a test substance for the assessment of the integrity of the pituitaryadrenal axis [2]. it is a powerful inhibitor of mammalian 11hydroxylases. two highly homologous 11-hydroxylase isoforms are known in humans: 11-hydroxylase ( xxxg571xxx )
catalyzes the last enzymatic step (conversion of 11deoxycortisol to cortisol) in cortisol biosynthesis, whereas
 xxxg572xxx  ( xxxg572xxx ) is responsible for the final

reactions in aldosterone biosynthesis [5]. via the inhibition
of  xxxg571xxx ,  xxxd2633xxx  administration results in the reduction of serum cortisol and consequent increase in acth
and 11-deoxycortisol concentrations. beside being used as a
test substance in the differential diagnosis of hypothalamuspituitary-adrenal axis disorders [6, 7],  xxxd2633xxx  was later
found to be an efficient drug for the treatment of hypercortisolism, as well [2-4].
by using homology modeling, roumen et al. suggested
that  xxxd2633xxx  docks flexibly into the active site of human
11-hydroxylase models (both  xxxg571xxx  and  xxxg572xxx ),
where its aromatic nitrogen may form strong interactions
with the sixth ligating position of the heme iron atom [8].
the accessible electron lone pair of the heterocyclic nitrogen
atom appears to be necessary for the complexation of the
heme iron that is a well-known interaction for non steroidal
inhibitors of cytochrome enzymes [9].  xxxd2633xxx  was able
to dock with both pyridine rings to the iron, but mainly favoured a conformation with the carbonyl facing arg110 [8].
both conformations of  xxxd2633xxx  have been observed
in crystal structures of other cytochrome p450 enzymes. the
binding of  xxxd2633xxx  to cyp3a4 resulted in essentially no
conformational changes in the protein.  xxxd2633xxx  is bound
directly to the heme iron by means of the alkylpyridine nitrogen [10] (fig. (3a)), and exhibits good shape complementarity with the cyp3a4 active site. the alternative binding
mode for  xxxd2633xxx  involves the nitrogen atom of the ketopyridine group, as observed previously in the cocomplex
with bacterial p450cam (fig. (3b)) [11].
 xxxd2633xxx  inhibits other enzymes involved in steroid
biosynthesis and metabolism ( xxxg570xxx , 17-, 18- and 19hydroxylases) too, albeit at much higher concentrations [13,
14]. in addition,  xxxd2633xxx  competitively inhibits the reductase activity of the enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 ( xxxg1084xxx ) catalyzing the conversion of inactive
cortisone to bioactive cortisol in a dose-dependent fashion
[15]. the dehydrogenase activity of  xxxg1084xxx  (conversion
of cortisol to cortisone) is also influenced by  xxxd2633xxx  in a
biphasic fashion, with enhancement at lower (1-10 ;m) and
inhibition at higher (100-1000 ;m) concentrations [15]. the

 xxxd2633xxx  and heme are shown in yellow and grey, respectively. the heme iron atom is shown in brown. the compound exhibits alternative binding orientations and interacts with the protein by means of both pyridinyl group of  xxxd2633xxx . the three-dimensional image was
generated with swiss-pdbviewer in combination with pov-ray [12].

biphasic modulation of  xxxg1084xxx  dehydrogenase may explain the decreased half-life of endogenous or infused cortisol following  xxxd2633xxx  administration in humans [16]. as
therapeutically achieved plasma concentrations of  xxxd2633xxx  vary between 10-65 gm [17, 18],  xxxd2633xxx  may
decrease cortisol levels not only by acting on the adrenal, but
also by influencing extra-adrenal bioformation, i.e. by inhibiting  xxxg1084xxx  reductase and stimulating  xxxg1084xxx  dehydrogenase activity.  xxxd2633xxx  reduced  xxxg1385xxx 
mrna abundance in human nci-h295 adrenocortical cancer
cells [19]: the clinical significance of this finding is, however, unclear.
although testicular steroidogenesis was found to be depressed in  xxxd2633xxx -induced corticosterone-deficiency in
rats, this was rather an indirect effect, as  xxxd2633xxx  had no
effect on leydig cell testosterone production [20].
daily dose range varies between 500 mg and 6 g. its action is rapid, and serum cortisol trough concentration is
reached within 2 hours after administration [2]. its major
metabolite is the active alcohol metabolite metyrapol (fig.
(2)). both  xxxd2633xxx  and metyrapol are conjugated with
glucuronide.  xxxd2633xxx  is rapidly eliminated from plasma
with a terminal half life of 1.9 ± 0.7 hours [17].
 xxxd2633xxx  is effective in all forms of hypercortisolism
[21]. side effects include skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, neurological toxicity (ataxia, lethargy, dizziness). as
acth is considerably increased by  xxxd2633xxx  treatment,
hirsutism in women and symptoms of mineralocorticoid
excess (hypertension, edema, hypokalemia) may develop due
to the enhanced secretion of steroids with androgenic and
mineralocorticoid activity [4]. escape phenomena may develop with  xxxd2633xxx  treatment, however, these are rarely
significant clinically [2]. induction of liver cyp3a4, a p450
cytochrome and activation of the  xxxg1598xxx  have
also been described in human hepatocyte cultures that may
interfere with the metabolism of other drugs [22]. me-

tyrapone may induce symptoms resembling narcotic withdrawal in opiate-dependent individuals by an unknown
mechanism [23].
 xxxd2633xxx  is well tolerated in pregnancy and no teratological effects were reported [24-26], but via the induction
of hypertension and sodium retention it may contribute to
preeclampsia [3]. as 19-hydroxylation is inhibited by  xxxd2633xxx , estriol production can be deficient [24]. a single
report described an inhibitory effect of  xxxd2633xxx  on uterine postaglandin output and smooth muscle activity in rats
[27], however, no problems with delivery in humans were
reported. some reports suggest that it might be the treatment
of choice when cushing’s syndrome develops in pregnancy
[7, 28].
 xxxd3436xxx 
4,5-epoxy-17-hydroxy-3-oxo-5-androstane-2-carbonitrile ( xxxd3436xxx , fig. (2)), an androstane-carbonitrile derivative is a competitive inhibitor of the enyzme 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5-4-isomerase (hsd3b). hsd3b
has two isoforms encoded by two separate genes expressed
in a tissue-specific manner.  xxxg1095xxx  is expressed in the
placenta, mammary gland and prostate, whereas  xxxg1096xxx  is
the isoform involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis in the
adrenal cortex, testicles and ovaries [5, 29]. hsd3b isoforms
catalyze the conversion of 3-hydroxy-5-ene-steroids (pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea)) to 3-oxo-4-enesteroids (progesterone, androstenedione) [30]. the two isoforms share 93.5% amino acid identity; their kinetic and
biochemical parameters are also similar.  xxxd3436xxx  inhibits
both, however, the affinity of  xxxg1095xxx  is 14-16-fold higher
for  xxxd3436xxx  [31].
as it blocks this early stage of steroidogenesis,  xxxd3436xxx 
affects the biosynthesis of all classes of steroid hormones
including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex steroids (estrogens, progesterone, androgens), but the compensa-

2738 current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 26

igaz et al.

tory stimulation of acth and renin limit its effectivity [32].
 xxxd3436xxx  enhances the expression of the cortisol-metabolising enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2
( xxxg1085xxx ) converting cortisol to inactive cortisone in rat
livers, thereby reduces cortisol bioavailability [33]. in contrast with its homologue  xxxg1084xxx  that exhibits both dehydrogenase and reductase activities,  xxxg1085xxx  mainly functions as a dehydrogenase [34].
its major active metabolite is 17-keto- xxxd3436xxx  (fig. (2))
that is excreted in the urine. the half-life of both  xxxd3436xxx 
and 17-keto- xxxd3436xxx  is 1-2 hours [35, 36].
preliminary reports suggested that  xxxd3436xxx  might be effectively used in the therapy of both cushing’s syndrome
and primary aldosteronism [37-40]. further studies, however, failed to support initial enthusiasm [41], and  xxxd3436xxx 
is only rarely applied nowadays in the therapy of cushing’s
syndrome. in contrast with humans,  xxxd3436xxx  is widely exploited in veterinary forms of hypercortisolism [42, 43].
recent studies revealed another, unique mode of its action by demonstrating that  xxxd3436xxx  is a noncompetitive
allosteric modulator of the  xxxg730xxx  (er) and thus
influences estrogen- and growth factor-dependent pathways
of estradiol-regulated cell proliferation [44].  xxxd3436xxx  was
shown to directly interact with both er- and er-, and to
promote er- expression that is a modulator of er- activity. clinical trials are therefore conducted to test its application in breast cancer [45]. novel findings indicate that
 xxxd3436xxx  might also modulate the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in rat livers [33].
daily doses of  xxxd3436xxx  range from 120 to 1440 mg.
side effects include asthenia, abdominal discomfort, nausea,
vomiting, gastritis, diarrhoea, paraesthesias and increased
production of saliva. escape phenomena due to increased
acth-release may occur. given that hsd3b inhibition
interferes with the production of sexual steroids including
progesterone,  xxxd3436xxx  cannot be used before or during
pregnancy [45].

multiple enzyme inhibitors
ketoconazole,  xxxd147xxx , etomidate and  xxxd2656xxx  block several enzymatic steps in cortisol biosynthesis
(fig. (1))
ketoconazole
 xxxg466xxx -acetyl-4-[4-((2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1h-imidazole-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxalan-4-ol)methoxy)phenyl]piperazine (fig. (4)) is an imidazole derivative oral antifungal
agent that efficiently inhibits fungal ergosterol biosynthesis.
the development of gynecomastia in treated patients led to
the recognition of its steroid biosynthesis inhibiting properties [46]. albeit at much higher concentrations than necessary for blocking the fungal enzymes, ketoconazole also
effectively inhibits mammalian cholesterol and steroid hormone biosynthesis [47]. c17,20 lyase activity (conversion of
17-hydroxypregnenolone to dhea, and 17- xxxd2303xxx  to androstenedione) is most sensitive to ketoconazole
[48-50], and 17-hydroxylase activity is less susceptible that
explains the greater suppressibility of testosterone secretion
as compared with that of cortisol. cholesterol side chain
cleavage enzyme ( xxxg570xxx ),  xxxg571xxx  and  xxxg572xxx  are
also inhibited by ketoconazole [51, 52].
recent molecular modeling studies support that  xxxg573xxx 
has only a single substrate binding pocket for both 17,20lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities [53, 54]. studies using
the substrate-heme complex approach suggest that ketoconazole binds  xxxg573xxx  with two polar-polar interactions via its
4’-chlorophenyl and 1-acetyl-piperazine groups as well as a
fe-n dative covalent bond [55-57]. fig. (5) shows a
ketoconazole molecule with its imidazole nitrogen bound to
the heme iron of cyp3a4 with the dative covalent bond
formation which is the base of inhibitory activity of the  xxxd63xxx 
compounds [58].
both cortisol and testosterone biosynthesis are effectively
blocked by ketoconazole, but antiandrogenic effects are
more prominent. gynecomastia is probably explained by the

suppression of testicular  xxxd3325xxx  production and the displacement of estrogen from steroid hormone binding globulin resulting in an increased estradiol-testosterone ratio [59,
60]. ketoconazole is also a weak competitive inhibitor of the
 xxxg1601xxx  in vitro [61, 62].
the hormonal changes elicited by ketoconazole are dosedependent and fully reversible [47]. recovery from steroidogenic blockade takes place within 8 to 16 hours after an
oral dose [47]. ketoconazole appears to be cleared from
serum in a biphasic fashion. the initial half-life is between 1
and 3.3 hours, whereas a terminal half-life of 8 hours was
determined [63]. it is extensively metabolized in the liver:
metabolites and the unchanged drugs are mostly excreted in
the feces [47].
given its great tolerability and ease of use, ketoconazole
is nowadays the most widely used drug in the pharmacotherapy of cushing’s syndrome even for long-term (5-7 years)
use [64]. it can be safely administered to children and also
during pregnancy, but may cause intrauterine growth retardation [65].
by blocking both cortisol and testosterone biosynthesis,
ketoconazole is ideal for the treatment of female hypercortisolemic patients with hirsutism. in contrast, hypogonadism
and gynecomastia may develop in males that limit its applicability. due to its prominent antiandrogenic effects and ease
of administration, ketoconazole is still in use as a secondary
hormonal treatment for prostate cancer [60]. ketoconazole
inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis directly by blocking the
conversion of methyl sterols to cholesterol and indirectly by
suppressing total cholesterol synthesis via feedback inhibi-

tion of the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis (3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase) by sterol intermediates [66, 67]. these actions are beneficial for clinical use [67].
there are some controversial reports on the possible effects of ketoconazole on pituitary acth-secretion. in vitro
studies on rat anterior pituitary and human pituitary tumor
cultures isolated from two patients with nelson’s syndrome
(an often aggressive form of acth-secreting pituitary tumor
developing after bilateral adrenalectomy) showed an inhibition of corticotropin (crh)-stimulated acth-release [68,
69], whereas others failed to confirm these findings [70].
loli et al. suggested that ketoconazole might even be a glucocorticoid agonist at the pituitary [71]. in clinical studies
involving patients with cushing’s disease, decreased or increased acth-concentrations were both described [72, 73].
overall, these variable effects on the pituitary do not seem to
be major players in the adrenostatic activity of ketoconazole
[74].
daily doses of ketoconazole vary between 200 and 1200
mg in up to four divided doses. it was found effective in both
acth-dependent and independent forms of hypercortisolism [75, 76] achlorhydria and gastric acid suppression by
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitors interfere with the absorption of ketoconazole. although mostly well tolerated, side effects are
common including gastrointestinal, dermatological (pruritus,
rashes) neurological (headache, irritability, somnolence,
dizziness). hepatotoxicity of possibly idiosynchratic origin
(no correlation with daily dose or treatment duration) is a
major side effect [2]. whereas reversible elevation of liver

2740 current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 26

transaminases is observed in about 5-10 % of patients, ketoconazole administration is safe, and severe hepatotoxicity is
very rare (1 in 15.000). occasional cases of fatal hepatotoxicity were, however, also reported [77].
ketoconazole interferes with the metabolism of many
drugs via the inhibition of several hepatic p450 enzymes e.g.
cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp1a2. these include calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines,  xxxg1060xxx  inhibiting statins, warfarin etc. [4]. it also inhibits the p450 enzymes involved in the formation of active 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d [78] that can be exploited in the chronic
therapy of hypercalcemic disorders associated with granulomatous disease (e.g. sarcoidosis) [79, 80]. impaired bioactivation of vitamin d by ketoconazole, however, is not clinically relevant in hypercortisolemic patients.
 xxxd147xxx 
 xxxd147xxx  ( xxxd147xxx , fig. (4)) was first introduced to clinical practice in 1959 as an anticonvulsant. it soon turned out, however, that adrenocortical insufficiency developed in the patients treated.  xxxd147xxx  inhibits several enzymes
including  xxxg570xxx ,  xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg579xxx ,  xxxg571xxx ,
 xxxg572xxx  and  xxxg574xxx , but its principal site of action in
inhibiting cortisol biosynthesis is at cholesterol side chain
cleavage catalyzed by  xxxg570xxx  [81]. therefore, cortisol,
aldosterone, androgen and estrogen production are all influenced. the mechanisms of  xxxd147xxx  binding and
action to these enzymes are not clarified, except for  xxxg574xxx .
 xxxd147xxx  is supposed to bind to the active site of
the aromatase with its para-aminophenyl group directed
towards the heme iron [82, 83].
 xxxd147xxx  suppresses baseline acth-receptor
expression both in normal ovine and human adrenocortical
tumor cell cultures [14, 19, 84]. the down-regulation of
acth-receptor expression in the human nci-h295 adrenocortical cell line was observed at the mrna level [19]. the
effect on acth-receptor suppression could be reversed by
the addition of glucocorticoids, suggesting that glucocorticoid signal transduction is involved in the regulation of
adrenocortical acth-receptor expression [14, 84].  xxxd147xxx  was also shown to inhibit cell proliferation in
the human nci-h295 adrenocortical carcinoma cell line [14].
despite this multifaceted activity profile,  xxxd147xxx 
as a monotherapy is often not effective enough to normalize
urinary cortisol excretion in patients with cushing’s syndrome [85], and combinations with  xxxd2633xxx  or ketoconazole are often warranted. escape phenomena related to
overwhelming acth-hypersecretion or hepatic enzyme
induction increasing its own metabolism may explain its
limited efficacy in hypercortisolism [2].

 xxxd147xxx  at a daily dose of 1 g reaches 70 fm that
is sufficient for significant inhibition of the  xxxg570xxx  [88].
its half-life prior to therapy is about 12-13 hours, but it falls
signicantly after several weeks of application to about 7
hours that may indicate an increase in its own metabolism
[89]. its major metabolite is hydroxyaminoglutethimide [3(4-hydroxyaminophenyl)-3-ethyl-2,6-piperidinedione] [90].
rashes (generalized, self-limiting, pruritic), fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and neurological (drowsiness, depression, somnolence, sedation, headache, letargy, blurred
vision, ataxia) side effects may develop [4].  xxxd147xxx  inhibits iodine uptake by the thyroid gland that
may rarely result in overt hypothyroidism, as the compensatory increase in  xxxd3368xxx  release is generally sufficient to overcome this inhibition [81]. as  xxxd147xxx  accelerates dexamethasone metabolism, hydrocortisone should be administered to prevent or to treat
adrenocortical insufficiency in patients receiving  xxxd147xxx  [81]. the metabolism of other drugs including
warfarin,  xxxd1884xxx , tamoxifen, etc. is also influenced [90]. it
is not applicable in pregnancy as it may cause female pseudohermaphroditism [3].
etomidate
r-(+)-ethyl-[1-(a-methyl-benzyl)-indol-5-carboxylatel
(etomidate, fig. (4)), an imidazole derivative short-acting
hypnotic with minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depressant effects and no analgesic activity was introduced in
the 1980s for the induction of general anesthesia. its anesthetic action is realized via the enhanced activity of inhibitory gaba (- xxxd2177xxx ) type a receptors resulting
in decreased neuronal excitability [91]. etomidate administration was soon associated with severe, transient adrenocortical insufficiency that may occur even after a standard
single dose [92]. it is the most potent adrenostatic drug both
in vitro and in vivo by blocking 11-hydroxylases (both
 xxxg571xxx  and  xxxg572xxx ) and to a lesser extent  xxxg570xxx 
[11, 48, 93-96]. 17,20-lyase is also affected [48]. like  xxxd2633xxx , etomidate is supposed to interact with the heme
iron in the active site of p45011 via its aromatic nitrogen
atom [8]. in contrast with  xxxd2633xxx , however, etomidate
does have hydrogen bonding interactions with the active
sites of 11-hydroxylase enzymes [8].
unlike the other imidazole derivative adrenostatic ketoconazole, etomidate does not have a major effect on cholesterol biosynthesis [66]. analogous to  xxxd147xxx ,
etomidate also inhibited cell proliferation in the human
adrenocortical cell line nci-h295, but it was much more
potent [11]. etomidate may thus be useful in the treatment of
adrenocortical cancer, as well.

 xxxd147xxx  is a first generation non-steroidal
aromatase inhibitor that has been applied in the therapy of
breast cancer for many years, but it has now been replaced
by more efficient inhibitors [86]. it is of interest to note that
 xxxd147xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx  were also tried in combination with some success for the treatment of postmenopausal
breast cancer [87].

it is the only steroid biosynthesis inhibitor available for
parenteral use that renders it as the treatment of choice for
the control of hypercortisolism in critically ill patients not
amenable to peroral drug administration. the onset of action
is rapid (<1 min.), and its half-life is 3-5 hours [97]. side
effects include nausea, vomiting, changes in breathing, heart
frequency, blood pressure and involuntary muscle movements (myoclonus) [98].

in the therapy of hypercortisolism, daily dose range varies from 0.5 to 2 g, 3-4 times a day. the plasma levels of

etomidate is mostly used in continuous infusion with
non-hypnotic doses ranging between 0.2-0.6 mg/kg/h. it has

been successfully used in several particular clinical settings
e.g. severe hypercortisolemia and peritonitis [99], severe
cushing’s disease [100], ectopic acth syndrome [101], and
together with the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist mifepristone in severe psychosis associated with ectopic acth
syndrome [102]. fig. (6) demonstrates the rapid and potent
action of intravenous etomidate in a patient with severe
cushing’s disease not able to take oral medications [100].
etomidate preparations in europe were previously available in an ethyl-alcohol based vehicle and nowadays in a
lipid emulsion form, whereas us products are administered
in a solution containing  xxxd3034xxx  [103] that can be
nephrotoxic and may cause metabolic acidosis [104]: however, no major side-effects were noted in a patient treated
with it for 5.3 months [103].
 xxxd2656xxx 
 xxxd2656xxx 
(o,p’-ddd, fig. (3)) was discovered to be an efficient inhibitor of steroid biosynthesis in 1949, following observations in
dogs that showed adrenal atrophy and severe adrenocortical
insufficiency after its administration [105].  xxxd2656xxx  is a
derivative of the insecticide ddt. its mechanism of action is
not entirely clear: the primary action of  xxxd2656xxx  is considered to be the induction of mitochondrial degeneration resulting in adrenocortical atrophy and necrosis. these adrenolytic properties render  xxxd2656xxx  superior to other steroid
inhibiting drugs in the treatment of adrenocortical cancer
[106]. the effects on adrenal steroidogenesis are supposed to
be mainly secondary to its adrenolytical effects, but several
reports described direct inhibitory effects on  xxxg570xxx ,
 xxxg571xxx ,  xxxg572xxx  and hsd3b [107].  xxxd2656xxx  is the
only effective adrenal-specific cytotoxic agent for the treatment of adrenal cancer in patients who cannot be cured by
surgery.  xxxd2656xxx  can be applied both in combination with
other cytotoxic drugs and as an adjuvant monotherapy. it can

even be used to induce „medical adrenalectomy”: the zona
fasciculata and reticularis are most susceptible to its adrenolytic effects, whereas the zona glomerulosa is only slightly
affected [106].
the metabolism of  xxxd2656xxx  is complex. by studying bovine adrenal homogenates, cai et al. described two major
ways of  xxxd2656xxx  metabolism. the major reactive derivative,
an acyl chloride is generated via -hydroxylation and subsequent dechlorination. the acyl chloride metabolite was
shown to be able to bind covalently several adrenal macromolecules. beside being targets of  xxxd2656xxx  inhibition,
cyp11b enzymes may also be involved in its activation.
the covalent binding of mitochondrial proteins is considered
to be the major point in the adrenolytic action [107, 108]. in
the presence of water, the acyl chloride is transformed to the
acetic acid derivative o,p’-dda (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(pchlorophenyl) acetic acid)) that is the major urinary metabolite [109]. in  xxxd2656xxx  treated patients, the plasma concentration of o,p’-dda was reported to be 10 times higher than
that of the parent compound [110-112]. another, minor
pathway involves -hydroxylation resulting in the formation
of o,p’-dde (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2dichloroethene) that is regarded as an inactive metabolite
[113]. (fig. (7)) both o,p’-ddd and o,p’-dde are lipophylic, therefore they tend to accumulate in fat tissues, where
they can be detected even months after the discontinuation of
therapy [113]. the metabolic transformation of  xxxd2656xxx  is
inhibited by ketoconazole and to a lesser extent by  xxxd2633xxx  [107] that argues against their combined application.
compared with m,p’- and p,p’-ddd isomers, o,p’-ddd
was more effective in suppressing adrenocortical cell growth
and cortisol secretion [109].
the protein targets of  xxxd2656xxx  metabolites have not been
identified. the generation of oxidative damage may also

participate in the adrenolytic  xxxd2656xxx  action, as antioxidants
(tocopherol) could reverse its adrenolytic effects [107].

 xxxd2656xxx  induces hepatic microsomal enzymes, and interferes with the peripheral metabolism of cortisol by inhibiting

inhibitors of steroid biosynthesis

hepatic 5-reductase, thus favoring 6-hydroxylation over
5-reduction [114, 115]. 6-hydroxycortisol is the most
characteristic metabolically inactive polar metabolite of
cortisol in  xxxd2656xxx -treated patients, that can be detected in
urine [116]. dexamethasone clearance is also faster in patients under  xxxd2656xxx  treatment [114]. due to the inhibition
of steroid biosynthesis and the increased peripheral metabolism,  xxxd2656xxx  therapy must be accompanied by high-dose
glucocorticoid replacement [107].
an interesting aspect of  xxxd2656xxx  action is related to the
possible inhibition of multidrug resistance proteins. the
multidrug resistance gene 1 product, p-glycoprotein was
shown to be highly expressed by adrenocortical tumors [117118], however, a clear correlation between p-glycoprotein
expression and clinical symptoms, steroid production, histological index or response to  xxxd2656xxx  therapy could not yet
been established [119]. multidrug transporters exhibit multispecificity for many relatively lipophilic, planar molecules
that are mostly weakly cationic with molecular weights under 800 da [120, 121]. p-glycoprotein expression may confer resistance of adrenocortical cancer cells to a variety of
cytotoxic drug regimens (e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine,
etoposide, cisplatin).  xxxd2656xxx  was shown to partially reverse
multidrug resistance by inhibiting drug efflux in vitro by
unknown mechanisms with maximal inhibition of pglycoprotein at a concentration of 15 mg/l [122, 123]. villa
et al. found it to be effective even at a concentration of 5
mg/l [124]. the in vivo efficacy of  xxxd2656xxx  on pglycoprotein inhibition is, however, a matter of debate [106,
125].  xxxd2656xxx  has already been used in combination with
several cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide,
vincristine, 5-fluorouracil,  xxxd3249xxx ); the clinical utility
of these combinations is variable [106, 126]. in a large italian study involving 72 patients with adrenocortical cancer,
berruti et al. observed an objective tumor regression in
48.6% of patients treated with the combination of etoposide,
doxorubicin, cisplatin and  xxxd2656xxx  [127]. novel, effective
p-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g. tariquidar [128]) are yet to be
tested in adrenocortical cancer.
in contrast with the other steroid biosynthesis inhibitors,
the onset of  xxxd2656xxx  action is very slow, and therapeutic
levels are reached by up to three months of application [129].
therefore, other adrenostatic drugs may be used in the meantime to alleviate symptoms. after oral administration, 35-40
% is absorbed, whereas 60% is excreted unchanged in feces
[110].  xxxd2656xxx  increases the production of several hormone
binding globulins (cortisol-, sex hormone-, thyroxine- and
vitamin d-binding) in an estrogen-like fashion [130]. at
concentrations equivalent to recommended therapeutic levels,  xxxd2656xxx  significantly stimulated the mrna expression
and secretion of sex hormone binding- and cortisol-binding
globulins in human hep89 cells (hepg2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line stably transfected with human er-),
however, these concentrations were 2000-fold higher than
those required for 17-estradiol action [131]. this huge
difference in activity is probably explained by the 1000-fold
weaker binding affinity of recombinant er- to  xxxd2656xxx 
than to 17-estradiol [132]. in addition, as  xxxd2656xxx  competes with endogenous thyroxine for binding thyroxinebinding globulins, total thyroxine levels may even be reduced despite increased thyroxine-binding protein concentra-

tions [133]. therefore, hormonal examinations are difficult
to interpret in  xxxd2656xxx -treated patients.
 xxxd2656xxx  is usually started in a daily dose of 1 g (500 mg
bid) that is increased in a stepwise fashion to a general daily
dose of 4 to 6 g. the maximum tolerated dose varies from 2
to 10 g daily. severe side effects and a narrow therapeutic
window limit its clinical use [134]. the semilogarithmic
relationship between plasma and tissue  xxxd2656xxx  concentrations may explain the narrow therapeutic range [135]. side
effects include anorexia, weakness, pruritus, gastrointestinal
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), endocrine (gynecomastia),
genitourinary (hematuria, hemorrhagic cystitis, albuminuria),
neurological (gait, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, depression,
somnolence, problems with language expression, optic nerve
toxicity) toxicity [107]. the severe neurological complications are dose-related, but even severe mental retardation can
be reversible upon drug discontinuation [136]. an undesirable side effect is related to an increase in serum total and
ldl-cholesterol concentrations that appears to be related to
the impaired hepatic production of oxysterols inhibiting
 xxxg1060xxx  [137]. hypercholesterinemia can be
treated with statins. prolonged bleeding time due to impaired
platelet aggregation has also been described [138]. the hepatic -glutamyl transpeptidase is often increased but this
rarely requires the discontinuation of  xxxd2656xxx . more than 80
% of patients experience at least one side effect [107].  xxxd2656xxx  can be effectively used for adrenocortical cancer in
childhood, but gynecomastia in boys and thelarche (breast
development) in girls is frequent in prepubertal patients
[139]. due to its teratogenic properties and slow release from
fat tissues,  xxxd2656xxx  cannot be used in women desiring pregnancy within 2-5 years after its discontinution [140].
 xxxd2656xxx  strongly induces hepatic microsomal p450 enzymes [107], the metabolism of barbiturates can be severely
affected [141] and the metabolism of warfarin is also accelerated [142]. a single report suggested that spironolactone
may block  xxxd2656xxx  action [143], therefore co-administration
of these two drugs should be performed with caution. the
metabolism and actions of  xxxd2656xxx  are depicted in fig. (7).
 xxxd2656xxx  therapy should be closely monitored by measurement of plasma  xxxd2656xxx  using high-performance liquid
chromatography [129, 144, 145]. de francia et al. proposed
that o,p’-dda should also be determined both in plasma and
red blood cells along with  xxxd2656xxx  [112]. clinical trials
showed that 14 mg/l plasma  xxxd2656xxx  concentration should
be surpassed for clinical effectivity, and neurological side
effects appear over 20 mg/l. some reports, however, described responses even at much lower concentrations (4-10
mg/l) that underlines interindividual variability [126, 146].
 xxxd2656xxx  blood levels do not correlate well with the daily
administered dose, however, a closer correlation with cumulative dose has been described [129, 134]. terzolo et al.
proposed to start plasma  xxxd2656xxx  monitoring as a cumulative dose of about 300 g has been reached, then to control it
on a montly basis until target levels are attained [134]. maintenance therapy can be effective with low dose (1-2 g/day)
adjuvant  xxxd2656xxx  [134, 147], and plasma level monitoring
every three months seems to be sufficient [134]. low-dose
therapy may be associated with good compliance and few
side-effects [147]. by contrast, faggiano et al. suggested a

2744 current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 26

igaz et al.

high-dose regimen (starting with 3 g/day that is increased to
6-9 g/day within 2 weeks) that may shorten the time required
to reach therapeutic effectivity [148]. in their preliminary
study involving six patients, they managed to achieve 14
mg/l plasma  xxxd2656xxx  concentration within four weeks with
acceptable toxicity ( xxxd2656xxx  therapy was discontinued in
one patient due to severe neurologic toxicity) [148].
in 1984, boven et al. described a patient and reviewed
similar cases with complete resolution of a histology-proven
adrenocortical cancer following  xxxd2656xxx  therapy [149].
subsequent clinical trials in patients with metastatic adrenal
cancer, however, failed to encourage this initial optimism, as
metaanalyses of these studies revealed an objective response
rate of only about 25% [107]. as an adjuvant therapy, however,  xxxd2656xxx  was recently found to singificantly prolong
recurrence-free survival in patients having undergone radical
resection of adrenocortical carcinoma [150]: and, therefore,
postoperative, adjuvant  xxxd2656xxx  therapy should be proposed
to all patients.
clinical application of steroid biosynthesis inhibitors
the therapeutic aim with steroid biosynthesis inhibitors
may be either a full or partial (adjusted) adrenal blockade
[74]. full adrenal blockade is associated with almost undetectable endogenous cortisol concentrations, and therefore
glucocorticoid replacement is mandatory to prevent adrenocortical insufficiency. on the other hand, the normalisation
of endogenous cortisol secretion is aimed at by partial blockade. both protocols are effective, but partial adrenal blockade may be more favorable as toxic side effects could be less
frequent with this approach [74]. whenever possible, therefore, partial blockade should be proposed in clinical practice.
partial blockade is not feasible with  xxxd2656xxx .
for the chronic treatment of hypercortisolism, administration of ketoconazole should be proposed given its favourable side-effect profile and good tolerability. based on
its antiandrogenic properties, it is the treatment of choice in
patients showing hyperandrogenic symptoms. in case of
hepatic toxicity or intolerance,  xxxd2633xxx  should be introduced, however,  xxxd2633xxx  may be associated with hyperandrogenic side-effects. the use of  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd147xxx  can only be proposed in combination with either
table 1.

ketoconazole or  xxxd2633xxx . theoretically, via the inhibition
of aldosterone biosynthesis,  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd147xxx  could be useful in the treatment of aldosteronism,
however,  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists are much more
effective. due to its adrenolytic properties,  xxxd2656xxx  is the
treatment of choice in adrenocortical cancer. acute, lifethreatening hypercortisolism or patients unable to take oral
medications should be treated with parenteral etomidate.
side-effects are summarized in table 1.
pregnant women who cannot be subjected to surgical intervention should be treated with  xxxd2633xxx .
beside hypercortisolism, steroid biosynthesis inhibitors
are also used in the treatment of major depression, based on
the assumption that disturbed functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity and hypercortisolemia
may contribute to its pathogenesis [151, 152].
conclusions and future directions
steroid biosynthesis inhibitors are applicable in all forms
of cushing’s syndrome. although the use of these drugs is
not considered as a first-line treatment, it can be a helpful
treatment option as a preoperative, radiosurgical alternative
or even as a stand-alone measure [4]. their reported efficacy
is variable, and a major problem is related to the wide range
of definitions (from normalization to some reduction of various endocrine parameters) used to describe efficacy in clinical studies. another major limitation of the clinical trials
with steroid biosynthesis inhibitors performed to date is
related to the fact that most of these were retrospective and
uncontrolled studies.
none of the steroid biosynthesis inhibitors used widely in
clinical practice are novel developments and none of them
are really specific that explains their many side effects. intensive investigations are ongoing for more selective and
potent inhibitors of steroid biosynthesis, however, most of
these compounds target the treatment of hormone sensitive
cancers (prostate and breast) by reducing sexual steroid biosynthesis without significantly affecting that of cortisol or
aldosterone. for example, inhibitors of  xxxg573xxx  that efficiently block 17,20-lyase activity without influencing 17hydroxylase [54, 57, 60, 153], and selective inhibitors of
 xxxg1095xxx  not affecting adrenal  xxxg1096xxx  are sought for [31].
these agents could reduce the secretion of sexual steroids

inhibitors of steroid biosynthesis

current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 26

without causing adrenocortical insufficiency. as cushing’s
syndrome and adrenocortical cancer are much less prevalent
than these cancers, the scientific and industrial drive for the
development of agents selectively inhibiting cortisol biosynthesis is less active. agents blocking aldosterone biosynthesis ( xxxg572xxx ) without affecting that of cortisol would present a viable alternative to  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists
in the treatment of primary aldosteronism and heart failure
[8].
in addition to inhibiting steroid biosynthetic enzymes,
 xxxd3436xxx ,  xxxd2633xxx  and  xxxd2656xxx  also reduce cortisol
bioavailability by affecting extraadrenal cortisol metabolism.
extraadrenal cortisol metabolism may represent another
target that could be more efficiently exploited by novel
drugs.
as crystal structures of the steroid biosynthetic cytochromes are not yet available, computational techniques (e.g.
homology modeling) can be used for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of these agents and for selecting those
with the most optimal characteristics.
