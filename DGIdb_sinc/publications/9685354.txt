the glutathione s-transferases ( xxxg1073xxx )1 catalyze the conjugation with glutathione of a number of electrophilic xenobiotics, including several carcinogens, mutagens, and anticancer
drugs (1– 6). usually, but not invariably, these electrophiles are
made less reactive by conjugation with glutathione, and the
conjugates are thought to be less toxic to the cell. consequently,  xxxg1073xxx  are believed to play an important role in the
defense of cells against these xenobiotic toxins.

trophilic alkylating agents, can form conjugates with glutathione both spontaneously and in gst-catalyzed reactions (7–14).
despite these catalytic activities, the role of  xxxg1073xxx  in the protection of cells from the cytotoxicities of these cancer drugs
remains equivocal due to the inconsistent results obtained by
different laboratories (5, 15–25). although some investigators
have found associations between cellular resistance to some
anticancer drugs and expression of particular isozymes of gst,
other investigators have found no such associations in other
cell lines. in mcf7 breast carcinoma cells, increased expression of alpha, mu, or pi class  xxxg1073xxx  failed to confer any consistent, significant resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs,
including drugs known to be substrates of  xxxg1073xxx  (19, 20, 24). we
recently proposed that conjugation of some of these drugs and
toxins with glutathione may represent only partial detoxification. in this view, export of the glutathione conjugate is required to fully potentiate the gst-mediated protection. the
identification of  xxxg13xxx  as an important glutathione-conjugate
efflux pump (26 –30) raises the possibility that  xxxg13xxx  and gst
may act in synergy to confer cellular resistance to some of these
compounds (31). this hypothesis was recently validated for the
model carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (31). these studies
showed that gst p1-1-associated protection from 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide cytotoxicity was dependent upon concomitant expression of  xxxg13xxx . additionally, gst p1-1-associated protection from 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-mediated dna adduct
formation was greatly enhanced by co-expression of  xxxg13xxx .
previous studies failed to demonstrate an association between increased  xxxg13xxx  expression and resistance to alkylating
agents in mcf7/vp cells (32). in another study examining
paired cell lines that differed in the levels of  xxxg13xxx  expressed,
increased  xxxg13xxx  was associated with  xxxd1665xxx  resistance
in one but not the other two paired cell lines (33). these
inconsistent relationships between increased  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxd3249xxx  sensitivity indicate that other factors, such as gst
or glutathione levels, may be important in determining
whether or not  xxxg13xxx  will mediate protection from the cytotoxicities of some alkylating cancer drugs. additionally, properties
of some of the bifunctional alkylating agents and their metabolites make them particularly interesting candidates for gst/
 xxxg13xxx -mediated detoxification. even after formation of monoglutathionyl derivatives, some of these bifunctional alkylating
agents retain significant reactivity at the unmodified alkylating group and may therefore remain cytotoxic. moreover, glutathione conjugates of some of these compounds, the nitrogen
mustards  xxxd2562xxx  and  xxxd1665xxx , are known to be transported by  xxxg13xxx -containing membrane vesicles in vitro (27, 33).

to examine the role of  xxxg12xxx  1
( xxxg13xxx ) and glutathione s-transferases ( xxxg1073xxx ) in cellular resistance to antineoplastic drugs, derivatives of
mcf7 breast carcinoma cells were developed that express  xxxg13xxx  in combination with one of three human
cytosolic isozymes of gst. expression of  xxxg13xxx  alone
confers resistance to several drugs representing the
multidrug resistance phenotype, drugs including doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and mitoxantrone. however, co-expression with  xxxg13xxx  of any of the human gst
isozymes a1-1, m1-1, or p1-1 failed to augment mrp1associated resistance to these drugs. in contrast, combined expression of  xxxg13xxx  and gst a1-1 conferred ;4fold resistance to the anticancer drug  xxxd1665xxx .
expression of  xxxg13xxx  alone failed to confer resistance to
 xxxd1665xxx , showing that the observed protection
from  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity was absolutely dependent upon gst a1-1 protein. moreover, using inhibitors
of gst ( xxxd1875xxx ) or  xxxg13xxx  ( xxxd3256xxx ), it was
shown that in mcf7 cells resistance to  xxxd1665xxx 
requires both intact  xxxg13xxx -dependent efflux pump activity and, for full protection, gst a1-1 catalytic activity. these results are the first demonstration that gst
a1-1 and  xxxg13xxx  can act in synergy to protect cells from
the cytotoxicity of a nitrogen mustard,  xxxd1665xxx .

gst a1–1/ xxxg13xxx  synergy in resistance to  xxxd1665xxx 
we have developed cellular models to examine the role of
gst/ xxxg13xxx  synergy in the emergence of anticancer drug resistance. although cell-free, in vitro analyses of toxin conjugation
and transport are informative, cellular models of  xxxg13xxx  and
gst function are essential to determine the cytoprotective
consequences of coordinated  xxxg13xxx  and gst expression and to
determine the precise mechanisms of cellular detoxifications.
accordingly, from mcf7 cells that express extremely low levels
of  xxxg13xxx  and gst, we have developed derivative sublines that
express  xxxg13xxx  alone or in combination with representatives of
three major classes of human cytosolic  xxxg1073xxx , gst a1-1, m1-1,
and p1-1. results show that gst a1-1 operates in synergy with
 xxxg13xxx  to confer resistance to the antineoplastic nitrogen mustard  xxxd1665xxx . the studies indicate the mechanism of synergy involves gst catalytic activity as well as  xxxg13xxx -mediated
efflux of glutathione conjugates.
experimental procedures

equilibration buffer, and then  xxxg983xxx  was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm tris (ph 9.6), 0.2 m nacl, and 5 mm glutathione. the eluate
was neutralized with dilute hcl, dialyzed against 10 mm kpo4 (ph 7.4)
plus 50% glycerol, and stored at 220 °c.
biochemical and in vitro gst enzyme analyses—glutathione levels
were measured by the enzymatic recycling method (39). gst activities
were determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (cdnb) as substrate (40). enzyme kinetic and in vitro inhibition analyses were accomplished using affinity-purified, recombinant human gst a1-1. for
these assays, cdnb served as the varied substrate, and glutathione
concentration was fixed at 2 mm. activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 25 °c and ph 6.5 as described by habig et al. (40).
northern blots of total cellular rna were done as described (41)
using probes derived from the entire human gst a1, gst m1, or gst
p1 cdnas (36, 37, 42) or the 59 2629 base pairs of the  xxxg13xxx  cdna (43).
the cdna probes were labeled with [a-32p]dctp by random priming
(44). western blot analyses of gst isoforms were accomplished as
described previously using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies
directed against human gst a1, gst m1, or gst p1 subunits (19).
western blotting of membrane protein preparations for  xxxg13xxx  was done
with the qcrl-1 antibody kindly provided by dr. s. p. c. cole (45).
in vivo (intact cells) analyses of the effects of inhibitors on mrp1mediated dnp-sg efflux and gst activity—for the analysis of
dnp-sg efflux, mcf7/vpa cells were plated to a density of 0.6 3 106
cells/well in 6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were preincubated for 2 min
in hbss plus vehicle or 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx . following preincubations, cells were co-incubated at 25 °c with 1 mm cdnb plus vehicle or
2 mm  xxxd3256xxx . at the indicated times, medium was removed and
acidified to 10% perchloric acid. cells were lysed in 10% perchloric acid.
medium and lysate samples were prepared for reverse phase high
performance liquid chromatography analysis as described (31). details
of dnp-sg chromatography will be described elsewhere.2 briefly, acidsoluble samples were eluted isocratically from a c18 reverse phase
column in 20% methanol 1 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. chromatographs
were monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and dnp-sg levels
were determined from the areas of peaks eluting at the position of
authentic dnp-sg by comparison with dnp-sg standards. concentrations of dnp-sg reference standards were determined using e340 5 10.2
cm21 mm21.
the effect of  xxxd3256xxx  or  xxxd1875xxx  on gst activity in vivo was
determined as follows. mcf7/vpa cells (0.5 3 106/well) were seeded in
6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were incubated in dmem plus 1% fetal
calf serum 6 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  or in hbss 6 0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  at
37 °c in 5% co2. at indicated times, cells were washed and incubated
in hbss equilibrated to 25 °c containing inhibitor (2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  or 0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx ) or vehicle plus 10 mm cdnb. relative in vivo
gst activities were determined as the rate of total dnp-sg formation
(dnp-sg in medium plus cell lysates) for 2 and 5 min at 25 °c. dnp-sg
levels were measured chromatographically as described above. the
levels of dnp-sg formation increased linearly with time throughout
the 5 min incubation periods.
results

characterization of cell lines—mcf7 breast carcinoma cells
were chosen to study the effects of expression of  xxxg13xxx  alone or
in combination with isozymes of gst. these cell lines constitute a good model system for such studies because parental
mcf7/wt cells express extremely low levels of cytosolic  xxxg1073xxx 
and  xxxg13xxx . additionally, a mdr derivative of mcf7/wt,
mcf7/vp, is available that has as its primary genetic and
phenotypic change the overexpression of high levels of  xxxg13xxx 
(32). like mcf7/wt, mcf7/vp cells have very low endogenous
cytosolic gst levels. neither mcf7/wt nor mcf7/vp contain
detectable  xxxg10xxx  (p-glycoprotein) or the  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx  or
 xxxg15xxx ) isoform (32).3
parental mcf7/vp cells were stably transfected with expression vectors containing cdnas encoding the human gst a1-1
(mcf7/vpa), gst m1-1 (mcf7/vpm), or gst p1-1 (mcf7/
vpp). additionally, control cell lines were generated by stable

drugs and chemicals—mitoxantrone,  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd3358xxx , and hepsulfan were provided by the drug synthesis
and chemistry branch, developmental therapeutics program of the
nci, national institutes of health (bethesda, md).  xxxd2191xxx  was from
life technologies, inc., and hygromycin was from calbiochem. all other
drugs were from sigma. stock solutions stored at 280 °c were  xxxd2068xxx  (5
mm in 50% ethanol), doxorubicin (5 mm in h2o), vincristine (1 mm in
h2o), mitoxantrone (5 mm in  xxxd1896xxx ),  xxxd1875xxx  (50 mm in
0.1 n naoh), and  xxxd3256xxx  (200 mm in  xxxd1896xxx ). the
following were prepared fresh:  xxxd1665xxx  (100 mm in ethanol),  xxxd2562xxx  (16.4 mm in acidified ethanol (;0.4 n hcl)),  xxxd444xxx  (250 mm in 71% ethanol), and  xxxd3358xxx  (100 mm in
h2o).
cell lines and tissue culture—cells were grown at 37 °c, 5% co2 in
dmem supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. all cell lines were
derived from cloned parental mcf7 breast carcinoma cell lines,
mcf7/wt ( xxxg983xxx   xxxg984xxx   xxxg1406xxx /mrp12), and the mdr derivative mcf7/vp (gst-/
mrp11) (32). cells expressing human isozymes of gst, gst a1-1, gst
m1-1, or gst p1-1 were established by stable transfection of mcf7/vp
cells with: 1) the dpcep4 vector (34) containing cdna inserts (35–37)
encoding the human  xxxg983xxx  gene (mcf7/vpa) or the  xxxg989xxx  gene
(mcf7/vpm), or 2) the pcdna3.1 vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
containing the cdna insert encoding the human  xxxg996xxx *a allele
(mcf7/vpp) as described previously (31). control cell lines were produced by stable transfection of mcf7/wt and mcf7/vp cells with
pcdna3.1 or dpcep4 lacking gst cdna inserts (mcf7/wt-neo,
mcf7/wt-hyg, mcf7/vp-neo, and mcf7/vp-hyg). cells transfected
with pcdna3- or dpcep4-based vectors were selected in 1 mg/ml
 xxxd2191xxx  or 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin, respectively. transfected cells were
routinely grown in the selecting drug ( xxxd2191xxx  or hygromycin) until a
few days before experiments, when they were transferred to drug-free
medium.
cytotoxicity determinations—drug cytotoxicities were determined
with the sulforhodamine b assay using 96-well microtiter plates (38) as
described previously (31). for  xxxd2068xxx , doxorubicin, vincristine, and mitoxantrone, cells were exposed to drug or equivalent vehicle continuously in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. for  xxxd1665xxx ,  xxxd2562xxx ,  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd3358xxx , and
hepsulfan, cells were exposed to drugs or vehicle for 1 h in either
serum-free dmem or dmem supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum.
in some experiments, cells were preincubated for 15 min in the
presence of vehicle or inhibitor (0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  (in hbss) or 2 mm
 xxxd3256xxx  (in dmem plus 1% fetal bovine serum)) followed by
co-incubation of  xxxd1665xxx  with vehicle or inhibitor (0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  (in hbss) or 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  (dmem/1% fetal calf serum)) for
1 h.
preparation of affinity-purified, recombinant human gst a1-1—
the human  xxxg983xxx  cdna (36) was ligated into the ecori site of the
pprok-1 plasmid expression vector (clontech). the protein was
expressed following transformation into e. coli dh5a. the culture was
grown overnight and then chilled, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.1
volume of 10 mm kpo4 (ph 8) plus 5 mm edta. the suspension was
warmed to 20 °c, incubated in lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min, chilled
on ice, sonicated, and then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 3 g for 20 min. the
supernatant was adjusted to 0.2 m nacl and loaded onto a glutathione
affinity column (sigma g-4510) equilibrated with 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph
7.4) plus 0.2 m nacl. the column was washed with 10 volumes of

tions (7–14). however,  xxxg13xxx  has not consistently been
associated with resistance to these drugs. nevertheless, a number of glutathione conjugates, including monoglutathionyl derivatives of  xxxd1665xxx  and  xxxd2562xxx , are known to be substrates of  xxxg13xxx -dependent transport in isolated membrane
vesicles (27, 33). therefore, we investigated whether  xxxg13xxx 
could support resistance to some of these alkylating agents if
co-expressed with the gst isozyme appropriate to accelerate
conjugate formation. there are reports that implicate gst
catalysis in detoxification reactions involving all of the alkylating agents listed in table ii (13, 15–18, 21–23, 25, 46). however, neither  xxxg13xxx  nor the isozymes of gst tested had any
significant effect on relative resistance to  xxxd2562xxx , 1,3-bis(2chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea,  xxxd3358xxx , or hepsulfan. in contrast,
co-expression of gst a1-1 and  xxxg13xxx  conferred significant
resistance to  xxxd1665xxx , a nitrogen mustard closely related
to  xxxd2562xxx  (fig. 3). indeed, cumulative results from 12 independent experiments showed that gst a1-1 expression is
associated with ;4-fold (3.74 6 0.19 s.e.) resistance to
 xxxd1665xxx  in mcf7/vpa cells compared with mcf7/vp cells
(p , 0.0001). resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  was gst a1-1
isozyme-specific because co-expression of  xxxg13xxx  with gst
m1-1 or gst p1-1 had no effect on cellular sensitivity to
 xxxd1665xxx  (not shown).

transfection of parental mcf7/wt and mcf7/vp cells with
empty expression vectors encoding antibiotic resistance to hygromycin (hyg) or  xxxd2191xxx  (neo) but not gst. expression of
gst isozyme-specific protein and mrna was detected only in
cell lines transfected with gst expression vectors (fig. 1). in
these cells (mcf7/vpa, mcf7/vpm, and mcf7/vpp), relatively high levels of gst activity were confirmed by enzyme
assays (table i). gst activities remained uniformly low in the
parental and control cell lines (table i). high levels of  xxxg13xxx 
expression (membrane protein and mrna) were seen only in
parental mcf7/vp cells and their transfected derivatives. coexpression of gst isozymes had no effect on the levels of  xxxg13xxx 
(fig. 2). finally, glutathione levels were comparable in all of
the cell lines tested (table i).
transfection of control vectors devoid of gst cdna inserts
into parental mcf7/wt and mcf7/vp cells had no effect on
gst levels (mcf7/wt-neo and -hyg; mcf7/vp-neo and -hyg),
glutathione levels (mcf7/wt-neo and mcf7/vp-neo), or
 xxxg13xxx  expression (table i). moreover, cytotoxicity profiles of
parental cells mcf7/wt and mcf7/vp were similar to the
corresponding cells transfected with control vectors (mcf7/
wt-neo and -hyg; mcf7/vp-neo and -hyg). thus, data reported
in the text below will not differentiate between the parental
cells and their corresponding derivatives transfected with control vectors.
effect of  xxxg1073xxx  on the sensitivities to drug cytotoxicities of
 xxxg13xxx -expressing mcf7 cells—the effect of  xxxg13xxx  expression,
alone or in combination with three different isozymes of cytosolic gst, on cellular sensitivities to various cytotoxic anticancer drugs was tested. many of these data are summarized in
table ii. a comparison of the relative resistance of mcf7/wt
versus mcf7/vp cells to four drugs of the mdr phenotype,
 xxxd2068xxx , doxorubicin, vincristine, and mitoxantrone, confirmed
previous findings (32) that increased expression of  xxxg13xxx  alone
confers resistance to these drugs. although  xxxd2068xxx , doxorubicin,
and vincristine are not known to form conjugates with glutathione, we wondered whether these drugs or their metabolic
derivatives might be unrecognized, toxic substrates of any of
the three cytosolic gst isozymes tested and, if so, whether the
gst isozymes would augment  xxxg13xxx -mediated resistance to
these drugs. although mitoxantrone can form glutathione conjugates, it is not known whether any of the cytosolic  xxxg1073xxx 
tested can catalyze these reactions. however, as shown in
table ii, expression of relatively high levels of gst a1-1
(mcf7/vpa cells), gst m1-1 (mcf7/vpm cells), or gst p1-1
(mcf7/vpp cells) had no significant effect on the level of
 xxxg13xxx -associated resistance to these mdr-related drugs.
in contrast to the mdr phenotype-associated drugs, a variety of alkylating anticancer drugs are known to form glutathione conjugates both spontaneously and in gst-catalyzed reac-

fig. 3. gst a1-1 confers resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  in mrp1expressing mcf7 cells. shown are the profiles for  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity (1-h drug exposure) in parental mcf7/wt (wt) and
mcf7/vp (vp) cells and in mcf7/vp cells transfected with gst a1-1
(mcf7/vpa, vp/a). error bars represent 6 1 s.d. from the mean
proportion of cells surviving (n 5 8) at the indicated  xxxd1665xxx 
concentrations.

expression of gst a1-1 protein and catalytic activity are
required for mcf7/vpa resistance to  xxxd1665xxx —inspection of cytotoxicity profiles of mcf7/wt versus mcf7/vp reveals that  xxxg13xxx  alone does not confer resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  (fig. 3). indeed, as shown here and reported previously
(32), expression of  xxxg13xxx  alone is associated with modest sensitization to  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity. this indicates that the
resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  in  xxxg13xxx -positive cells is absolutely
dependent upon gst a1-1 protein expression. to confirm this
relationship and to eliminate the possibility that mcf7/vpa is
an exceptional mcf7/vp clone, in which the resistance to
 xxxd1665xxx  is independent of gst a1-1, we tested whether
inhibition of gst catalytic activity in vivo would reverse resistance in mcf7/vpa cells.
 xxxd1875xxx  was chosen as a candidate inhibitor because it has
been reported to inhibit a rodent alpha class gst and was
expected to inhibit the human ortholog, gst a1-1 (47). additionally,  xxxd1875xxx  is lipophilic and therefore should freely
traverse the cell membrane of intact cells. to determine
whether the inhibitory properties and potency of  xxxd1875xxx 
would likely be sufficient to inhibit cellular gst a1-1 at subcytotoxic levels, we first examined the kinetics of  xxxd1875xxx 
inhibition of the conversion of cdnb to dnp-sg by purified,
recombinant gst a1-1 in vitro. these results (fig. 4a) show
that  xxxd1875xxx  inhibition is of the mixed type and is quite
potent for this gst a1-1-catalyzed reaction (kic 5 3.6 mm; kiu
5 4.4 mm) (48). the effect of exogenously added  xxxd1875xxx  on
gst a1-1 activity in vivo is examined in fig. 4b. these data
show that 0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  inhibited gst activity in mcf7/
vpa cells by at least 80%, that inhibition was maximal within
15 min, and that inhibition remained at this level throughout
the 1-h incubation. treatment of intact cells with 0.1 mm di-

fig. 4. inhibition of gst a1-1 by  xxxd1875xxx , in vitro and in
vivo. a, kinetic analysis of  xxxd1875xxx  inhibition of gst a1-1 in vitro
was accomplished using affinity-purified gst a1-1 and cdnb as the
variable substrate (see under “experimental procedures”). under these
conditions, kinetic parameters estimated from the data shown in the
hane’s plots are: v 5 64.3 mmol/min/mg enzyme and km 5 0.36 mm for
cdnb; and kiu 5 4.4 mm and kic 5 3.6 mm for  xxxd1875xxx . b, inhibition
of gst a1-1 in vivo was done as described (see under “experimental
procedures”). cells were incubated with 0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  (open circles,
1  xxxd1875xxx ) or vehicle (closed circles, 2  xxxd1875xxx ) at 37 °c, and at the
indicated times, the rate of cdnb conversion to dnp-sg was measured
in intact cells. shown are mean values 6 the range of duplicate determinations, expressed as the fraction of 0 time controls.

cumarol had no effect on the kinetics of  xxxg13xxx -dependent
dnp-sg efflux (data not shown). based upon these preliminary
results, the effect of gst a1-1 inhibition by  xxxd1875xxx  on
mcf7/vpa cell sensitivity to  xxxd1665xxx  was examined.
treatment of mcf7/vpa cells with 0.1 mm  xxxd1875xxx  sufficient to inhibit gst activity by $ 80% resulted in nearly
complete reversal of gst a1-1-associated resistance (fig. 5a).
moreover,  xxxd1875xxx -mediated sensitization was selective for
gst a1-1-expressing mcf7/vpa cells because  xxxd1875xxx  had
no significant effect on the sensitivities of mcf7/wt and
mcf7/vp cells to  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity (fig. 5, a and b).

gst a1–1/ xxxg13xxx  synergy in resistance to  xxxd1665xxx 

these results demonstrate that gst a1-1 catalytic activity is
indeed required for  xxxd1665xxx  resistance in mcf7/vpa cells.
however, these data leave undefined the role of  xxxg13xxx  in this
resistance to  xxxd1665xxx .
 xxxg13xxx -dependent glutathione conjugate efflux activity is
required for  xxxd1665xxx  resistance in mcf7/vpa cells—to
evaluate the requirement for  xxxg13xxx  in the observed  xxxd1665xxx  resistant phenotype, we used  xxxd3256xxx  to inhibit
 xxxg13xxx -mediated efflux of glutathione conjugates in vivo. the
concentration of  xxxd3256xxx  added (2 mm) was without significant cytotoxicity. moreover, addition of 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  had very little effect on in vivo gst a1-1 activity over the
entire 1-h incubation period (fig. 6a). however, under these
same conditions,  xxxd3256xxx  effectively inhibited  xxxg13xxx -dependent efflux of the glutathione conjugate, dnp-sg, (fig. 6b,
top panel) to efflux rates comparable to those seen when mrp1dependent efflux is inhibited by atp depletion (31).4 additionally, inhibition of efflux by  xxxd3256xxx  resulted in a profound increase in intracellular accumulation of dnp-sg (fig.
6b, bottom panel). the effect of similar treatments with  xxxd3256xxx  on  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity is reported in fig. 7.
 xxxd3256xxx  completely reverses mcf7/vpa resistance to
 xxxd1665xxx  but has little effect on mcf7/wt or mcf7/vp
cells (fig. 7, a and b). thus,  xxxd3256xxx  sensitization to
 xxxd1665xxx  toxicity is selective for gst a1-1-expressing cells.

dnp-sg efflux in vivo. a, mcf7/vpa cells were preincubated for 15
min at 37 °c in medium containing 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  or vehicle.
medium containing  xxxd3256xxx  or vehicle was replaced, and at the
indicated times, gst activity was determined in vivo (intact cells) as
described under “experimental procedures.” gst activities are expressed as the percent of vehicle treated (minus  xxxd3256xxx ) controls 6 1 s.d. (n 5 4). b. mcf7/vpa cells were preincubated with 2 mm
 xxxd3256xxx  or vehicle for 2 min. medium 1 (open circles) or 2
(closed circles) 2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  and containing 1 mm cdnb was
added at time 0 at 25 °c. the rates of dnp-sg efflux (appearance in
medium, top panel) and intracellular accumulation (appearance in cell
lysates, bottom panel) were determined at 25 °c as described (see under
“experimental procedures”).

we conclude that  xxxg13xxx -dependent glutathione conjugate efflux activity is absolutely required to potentiate gst a1-1mediated resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  in mcf7 cells under the
conditions used.
discussion

our results establish that  xxxg13xxx  and gst a1-1 act in synergy to confer resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  in mcf7 cells. the
co-dependence of resistance upon both gst a1-1 and  xxxg13xxx  is
remarkable. first, that gst a1-1 activity alone does not confer
protection indicates that the glutathione conjugate(s), or other
metabolites, of  xxxd1665xxx , the formation of which is favored
in the presence of gst a1-1, may be toxic to the cells. because
the conjugate(s) and other derivatives of  xxxd1665xxx  formed
are more water-soluble than the parent compound and, therefore, less permeable to the plasma membrane, they may accumulate to high intracellular levels in the absence of  xxxg13xxx  or
another suitable efflux mechanism. this may explain why gst
a1-1, at the levels achieved, is insufficient to confer protection
from  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity in the absence of  xxxg13xxx -dependent efflux activity. it is perhaps even more remarkable that
 xxxg13xxx  alone fails to confer protection from  xxxd1665xxx  cytotoxicity. this finding is particularly significant because glutathione conjugation of  xxxd1665xxx  can occur non-enzymatically (10, 49) and because glutathione conjugates of
 xxxd1665xxx , especially the monoglutathionyl derivative, are

not affect the relative sensitivities to  xxxd1665xxx  among the cell lines.

gst a1–1/ xxxg13xxx  synergy in resistance to  xxxd1665xxx 

reportedly substrates of  xxxg13xxx -dependent transport in isolated
membrane vesicles (33). thus, it is not immediately obvious
why  xxxg13xxx  alone does not afford some protection from  xxxd1665xxx  toxicity. these issues have important implications for
understanding the dynamics of drug detoxification and the
relative importance of the components of drug detoxification
studied— components that include phase ii drug conjugation
(gst/glutathione) and phase iii drug/conjugate efflux ( xxxg13xxx ).
gst a1-1 is known to catalyze the formation of the monoglutathionyl, but not the diglutathionyl, derivative of  xxxd1665xxx  from glutathione and  xxxd1665xxx  (49). however, the
catalytic rate enhancement is relatively modest (10, 11, 49).
indeed, meyer et al. (49) suggest that, rather than increasing
the overall extent of conjugation with glutathione, the major
effect of the human gst alpha class isoforms, a1-1, a1-2, and
a2-2 on  xxxd1665xxx  metabolism may be to increase the proportion of monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  relative to diglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  and other derivatives (including hydroxyand phosphate-substituted metabolites) (49). this altered profile is believed to be the combined consequence of 1) gst alpha
class catalysis of monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  formation,
and 2) the ability of these  xxxg1073xxx  to sequester monoglutathionyl
 xxxd1665xxx  at the enzyme active site with high affinity (49).
because the monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  retains one of
the reactive chloroethyl groups, this metabolite of  xxxd1665xxx 
is only partially detoxified. although gst a1-1 may sequester
the monoglutathionyl derivative and thereby mitigate some
toxicity, with continued exposure to  xxxd1665xxx , this gst:
monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  interaction will become saturated and will inhibit further catalysis (49, 50). thus, in the

absence of  xxxg13xxx -dependent efflux of the monoglutathionyl
derivative, the detoxification capacity of gst a1-1 may be
quickly exceeded. it is possible that the other derivatives may
also have some toxicities at high intracellular levels.
our transfection data show that gst a1-1 protein is required for  xxxg13xxx -associated resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  in
mcf7 cells. moreover, results from in vivo inhibition of gst
a1-1 with  xxxd1875xxx  indicate that gst catalytic activity is also
an important requirement for maximum resistance. we have
recently confirmed that purified gst a1-1 does bind radiolabeled monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  with considerable avidity.3 hence, both catalytic activity and  xxxd1665xxx  conjugate
binding could be important mechanisms of gst a1-1-associated cytoprotection. in our view, gst a1-1 may serve to catalyze the substitution of glutathione to one of the chloroethyl
groups of  xxxd1665xxx . these monoglutathionyl derivatives,
formed both enzymatically and non-enzymatically, can then be
sequestered as relatively benign complexes with gst a1-1
until they can be delivered to  xxxg13xxx  for export. in the absence
of  xxxg13xxx , as monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  accumulates intracellularly, the catalytic activity gst a1-1 is compromised by
product inhibition and the binding capacity of the enzyme for
monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  is exceeded. consequently, the
levels of  xxxd1665xxx  remain high, and the levels of reactive,
free monoglutathionyl  xxxd1665xxx  and its other derivatives
accumulate intracellularly resulting in increased cytotoxicity.
in the absence of gst a1-1, not only is the monoglutathionyl
derivative free to react with cellular macromolecules, but the
distribution of  xxxd1665xxx  metabolites is shifted away from
the monoglutathionyl forms to other derivatives that are significantly poorer substrates for  xxxg13xxx -mediated efflux. the
potential importance of such gst a1-1-dependent changes in
the profile of  xxxd1665xxx  glutathione conjugates and derivatives is underscored by the recent findings of barnouin et al.
(33). these investigators show that the monoglutathionyl
 xxxd1665xxx  is by far the best  xxxd1665xxx  derivative for
 xxxg13xxx -dependent transport in isolated membrane vesicles in
vitro.
the three isozymes of gst tested confer no protection to
 xxxg13xxx -expressing mcf7/vp cells against the cytotoxicities of
the four other alkylating agents examined. the reason for this
is unknown. the  xxxg1073xxx  examined may have little impact in vivo
on the metabolism of  xxxd3358xxx , hepsulfan, or  xxxd444xxx . additionally, it is not known whether
 xxxg13xxx  can support the efflux of glutathione conjugates of  xxxd3358xxx  or hepsulfan. some gst isozymes are reported to catalyze
the denitrosation of  xxxd444xxx , but
these studies have not identified stable glutathione conjugate
intermediates (15, 22). thus, there may be no stable glutathione conjugate of  xxxd444xxx  to serve as
a potential  xxxg13xxx  substrate. particularly interesting is the
failure of gst a1-1 and  xxxg13xxx  to confer resistance to  xxxd2562xxx , a nitrogen mustard closely related to  xxxd1665xxx . the
explanation for the difference in  xxxd2562xxx  and  xxxd1665xxx 
resistance is unknown. structural differences in these drugs
may result in gst a1-1 having distinctly different effects on
the metabolic profiles of  xxxd2562xxx  and  xxxd1665xxx  or their
glutathione conjugates in vivo. alternatively, glutathione conjugates of  xxxd2562xxx  may be less efficiently exported by  xxxg13xxx .
regardless of the explanation, our results show that  xxxg13xxx /
gst resistance synergy is both specific for a particular gst
isozyme:drug pair and highly drug-selective, even among structurally related drugs.
the magnitude of  xxxg13xxx -mediated resistance to four drugs of
the mdr phenotype was not significantly augmented by coexpression of gst a1-1, gst m1-1, or gst p1-1. this result

was not surprising for the drugs doxorubicin,  xxxd2068xxx , and vincristine, which are not known to form stable conjugates with
glutathione. however, it was important to examine these drugs
because it was possible that unrecognized metabolites or derivatives of these compounds might form glutathione conjugates
that could influence their export by  xxxg13xxx . in contrast, mitoxantrone reacts with glutathione to form conjugates (51). however, mitoxantone is not known to be a substrate of cytosolic
 xxxg1073xxx , although it is reported to be a substrate of microsomal
gst (52). the failure of the cytosolic  xxxg1073xxx  tested to augment
 xxxg13xxx -mediated resistance to mitoxantrone is consistent with
these data.
in summary, we demonstrate that gst a1-1 can act in
synergy with  xxxg13xxx  to confer resistance to the  xxxd3249xxx 
 xxxd1665xxx . the concept of coordinated action of phase ii
gst-dependent and phase iii  xxxg13xxx -dependent (and other
membrane transport proteins) processes will very likely prove
to be of general importance for detoxification of a variety of
xenobiotic compounds, electrophiles that include genotoxic carcinogens (31) and anticancer drugs. the mechanism of gst
a1-1/ xxxg13xxx  resistance to  xxxd1665xxx  depends upon both gst
a1-1 catalytic activity and  xxxg13xxx -dependent efflux activity.
moreover, because  xxxg13xxx  is required to potentiate gst a1-1associated resistance to  xxxd1665xxx , this suggests the possibility that some of the glutathione conjugates or other metabolites may themselves be important cellular toxins.
additionally, the removal of these conjugates by  xxxg13xxx  may be
required to relieve product inhibition and thereby maintain
continued gst catalysis of drug conjugation. finally, gst/
 xxxg13xxx  resistance synergy is highly specific for the particular
xenobiotic: gst isozyme pair. there are multiple known and
putative membrane-associated transport proteins related to
 xxxg13xxx  (53). it is possible that the complete detoxification of
xenobiotic-glutathione conjugates will prove to be similarly
dependent upon the specific membrane-associated transport
protein expressed.
