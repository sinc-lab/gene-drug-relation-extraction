summary. kinetics of antagonist-induced decrease of histamine- xxxg1078xxx -mediated steady-state responses in
isolated rabbit arteries were studied in the presence of
histamine- xxxg1079xxx  antagonist  xxxd2082xxx . data were
fitted using a model which describes competition kinetics
at the receptor level. estimated rate and equilibrium constants were evaluated for their dependence on tissue,
agonist and antagonist concentrations, using (+) xxxd375xxx  as antagonist. in large arteries (thoracic and arcus aorta), rate constants were observed to
be modified by agonist and/or antagonist concentrations,
suggesting a diffusion-controlled process. in relatively
small (common carotid and iliac) arteries, estimated equilibrium constants (and consequently the rate constants)
were found to diverge despite the invariance of equilibration times between arteries, leading us to include the
effects of spare receptors in our evaluation. a model
describing the effects of receptor reserve on the estimated
equilibrium dissociation constant was developed and
stimulated and the results then compared with those that
had been experimentally estimated. the reserve hypothesis was experimentally verified in common iliac artery
(where ecs0 <ka) using the irreversible antagonist
phenoxybenzamine. a rationalized rule for the optimization of experimental design for in-vitro disequilibriumcompetition experiments was proposed. common carotic
artery was found to be favorable for the present design
in view of its reserve properties. in addition, competition
reaction seems to be the rate-determining step in this
artery. rate and equilibrium constants of  xxxd3050xxx ,
(+)- xxxd375xxx , diphenhydramine and  xxxd186xxx 
were therefore determined in the common carotid artery
and were compared with those obtained from independent experiments. results suggest that the estimated parameters reflect drug-receptor interaction.

introduction

isolated tissue preparations define established systems
used both in the pharmacological classification of drug
receptors and in order to understand drug concentrationresponse relationships (furchgott 1987). the theory and
related techniques for obtaining information about the
parameters of drug-receptor interaction or those of tissue
response, on the other hand, are valid almost exclusively
for equilibrium states (stephenson 1956; arunlakshana
and schild 1959; furchgott 1966). therefore, they provide no information relevant to the rate of antagonist or
agonist action. preliminary studies on the rate of drug
action have been due to paton (paton 1961, 1975), and
the subject subsequently taken up by many authors (rang
1966; waud 1967; thron and waud 1968; roberts and
stephenson 1976; ruffolo and patil 1979; cory et al.
1984). in the experiments on rate of antagonism, waud
(1967) and roberts and stephenson (1976) concluded
that, due to the diffusion-controlled process of in-vitro
antagonism, one cannot obtain any useful information
about the kinetics of drug-receptor interaction.
recently, clancy et al. (1987) have proposed a new
design which claims to overcome this problem. in their
design, agonists have been used at the highest possible
concentrations ([a] >>ka) on the theory that it would
reduce the rate of competition reaction without affecting
the rate of antagonist diffusion, so that a competitionlimited antagonism would be retained. this, however,
may not be the case when the dissociation rate constant
of the agonist is greater than that of the antagonist (see
motulsky and mahan 1984). additionally, the authors
have assumed that the nature of stimulus-response coupling is homogeneous-linear, concluding that it would be
possible to estimate the rate constants of the competition
process provided that the rate-determining step is indeed
the competition reaction.
in the present paper we introduce certain additional
design criteria which take into account the nonlinear
nature of stimulus-response coupling, using histamine
and (+)- xxxd375xxx  in rabbit arterial preparations

methods

1 0 - 1 5 mn initial tension through continuous overflow of the
buffer. amplified transducer signals (digitco-la 10000 linear
amplifiers, ankara) were digitalised with a resolution of 0.5 hz and
12 bit and were recorded with an epson pc + / h d computer using
general purpose in-vitro laboratory software (onaran and b6kesoy,
unpublished). hz-receptor antagonist  xxxd2082xxx  (100 p-m) were
applied 20 min before the start of each experiment. concentrationresponse data for histamine in various segments were obtained using
cumulatively increasing concentrations of histamine (from 10-7 up
to 10 -3 m) with an increment of v4loglo m.
in time-dependent experiments a single concentration of histamine (30 p.m) was used to obtain a primary response, then washed
out for 30 min following a 10-rain exposure to histamine. a reproducible steady-state response was elicited with 3, 10 or 30 p-m histamine. antagonist-induced decrease of steady-state response was
followed until it attained a new steady state. 100 p-m of  xxxd3050xxx 
(ca. l0 s times of its kb) was used to determine the antagonistsensitive portion of the total responses, since an insensitive residual
was generally observed with the antagonists used in this study. baseline was corrected for this third steady state. 100 p-m ofmepyramine
itself did not produce a contraction and the residual response leading
a systematic underestimation of pa2 value (see below) was observed
only when the agonist is applied before the antagonists. the present
data, therefore, reflect the antagonist sensitive response only. a
demonstrative recording of complete procedure applied to a single
arterial ring is shown in fig. 1. three rings from an arterial segment,
one serving as control (without antagonist) and others to duplicate
the above procedure, were used. duplicates were evaluated as a
single experiment. preparations possessing a spontaneous "fade"
(more than 5% of total responses during the experiment) in their
controls, were excluded, otherwise data were not corrected for fade.
each one of the rings was used for a single experiment in order to
avoid putative permanent effects of antagonists. in the experiments
with the rings of common iliac artery, which were either untreated
or treated for 15 min with phenoxybenzamine (0.3 p-m) in krebshanseleit buffer at room temperature, concentration-response
curves were obtained before the kinetic experiments. preparations
were equilibrated for 90 min through overflow of the buffer after
phenoxybenzamine treatment.
in a separate group of experiments, steady-state responses
elicited by histamine were followed during hyperdilution of the
bathing medium (i.e., the bathing medium was quickly replaced
with previously gassed krebs-hanseleit solution at 37°c and continuously washed through overflow instead of antagonist application). the data thus obtained were fitted by first order decay
equation. all drugs were prepared as stock solutions, stored at 4 ° c,
and working solutions prepared daily.
the following drugs were used: histamine di hc1 (koch and
light),  xxxd186xxx  hci (ciba), diphenhydramine hci (parke and
davis), (+)- xxxd375xxx  maleate (eczaclba~l, istanbul),
 xxxd3050xxx  maleate (specia),  xxxd2082xxx  (eczaclba~l, istanbul) and
phenoxybenzamine (sk & f).  xxxd2082xxx  (base) was dissolved in
equimolar hc1.

preparations and experimental protocol. approximately threemonth-old new zealand albino rabbits of either sex were exsanguinated under  xxxd3354xxx  (50 mg/kg) anesthesia. thoracic
aorta from ca. 3 cm above the diaphragm, ascending part of arcus
aorta, common carotid artery from ca. 1 cm above its aortic bifurcation and common iliac artery were quickly obtained and washed
free of blood with krebs-hanseleit solution, endothelium was removed using a cotton thread and the vessels were cut into rings of
2 mm width. the rings, which were then opened by cutting the
vessels longitudinally, were fixed with stainless steel clips at both
ends, and then placed in organ baths containing krebs-hanseleit
solution of the following composition (ram); na + 138.2, k + 5,
ca 2+ 2.5, mg 2+ 0.5, c1- 123, hco~- 25, h2po4 1.2, dextrose
11.5, gassed with carbogen (95% o2 + 5% co2) providing ca.
7.4 ph at 37 ° c. the preparations were connected to isometric forcedisplacement transducers (grass ft.03 and ft.10) via 80 p- monofilament nylon threads and were equilibrated for 60-- 70 min under

statistics and calculations. least squares estimates of rate constants
were obtained using the software cited above. the nonlinear regression subroutine in the software is based on the minimization
algorithm of nelder and mead (1965) which minimize a sum of
squares function without calculating derivatives (turbo tm pascal
source of the procedure is available from the authors). estimated
parameters were presented as mean values calculated from individual experiments (n = 5 - 8 ) with se of mean. anova or student's
t for uncorrelated samples were used to determine the differences
between means. concentration-dependence of rate constants was
tested for individual cases using the residual sum of squares obtained
from constrained and unconstrained estimations (see de lean et
al. 1978, 1981). that is, parameters obtained for one antagonist
concentration were used to constrain the fitting of the other concentration. f statistics were used to determine the probability of variance ratios, p < 0.05 was considered as significant for all statistics.

as an experimental model. a comparison between experimental data and the results of a hypothetically developed
model (which describes the effects of receptor reserve on
the estimated parameters), emphasizes two points: first,
use of tissues possessing a low receptor reserve is preferential and, second, an appropriate selection of agonist concentration range is necessary. the rate constants of
 xxxd3050xxx , (+)- xxxd375xxx , diphenhydramine
and  xxxd186xxx  were therefore estimated in the common
carotid artery (which is advantageous with respect to
receptor reserve and diffusion properties). results
suggest that estimated rate constants for antagonists and
histamine [for which there are no available values from
radioligand binding studies at 37 ° c, excluding  xxxd3050xxx  (wallace and young 1983)] reflect the competition
kinetics, and it is further concluded that prior information about the equilibrium parameters of the experimental system is necessary for reliable estimation of the
rate constants, even when the rate-determining step is the
competition reaction.

where [d]o, [d]i, r, dr, koi, kit, k , k-x are drug concentrations at
the medium and biophase, free receptors, drug-receptor complex,
"out to in" and "in to out" diffusion rate constants, association and
dissociation rate constants, respectively. in the limiting cases where
drug-receptor interaction is the rate-determining step, [d]o and [d]i
would be considered at equilibrium during the process and the above
scheme may be simplified as

(k4/k3) is known. these are generally available from radioligand
binding and equilibrium experiments. in the present study, the equilibrium dissociation constant of histamine (ka) was used. it was
determined in common iliac artery using the receptor-alkylating
agent phenoxybenzamine (as described by furchgott 1966) and was
obtained from the literature (chang et al. 1979; komer et al. 1986;
treherne and young 1988), as an average value of 30 ixm, since
analytical solutions for rate constants (see below) were not found
to be sensitive to small fluctuations in ka (not demonstrated), kl
was eliminated by substituting kz[a]/ka for kl[a] in eq. (1 a), yielding d = kax where x = ([a]/ka) + i. solutions for k2, k3 and k4
were then obtained using the following identities:
a + b = k2x + k3[b] + k4

where a, b, kl, k3, k2, k4 are agonist, antagonist, association rate

of agouist and antagonist, respectively. in the present design, the
agonist is assumed to be at equilibrium when the antagonist is
applied (t = 0), and concentration of a and b to be invariant during
the process due to the negligible volume ratio of the receptor compartment vs. the bathing medium. the simultaneous initial value
problem concerning this system may be stated as follows (from the
law of mass action):

where rt is the total concentration of receptors. the problem can
be solved for [ar] using laplace transformations. details of the
solution are not given in the present paper. motulsky and mahan
(1984) have published a solution of a similar problem with a different
boundary condition ([ar](0) = 0) (see also aranyi 1980). the
present solution is given (using the symbols which have been used
by clancy et al. (1987), who obtained an identical solution to the
problem) as

solutions for these constants.

empirical model describing the effect of stimulus-response coupling
on the estimated pa2 (--logkb). in disequilibrium-competition experiments where eq. (1 a) is estimated, the equilibrium dissociation
constant of the antagonist-receptor complex may be expressed in
terms of the parameters of eq. (1 a) using the analytical solutions
for k3 and k, given above:
kb = k4/k3 = c [b]/x(ab-c)where x = ([a]/ka) + 1 or
pa2 = logx-log[b] + log[(ab/c)-1].

(3)

the expression ab/c which appears on the right hand side of eq. (3)
is the inverse of the relative equilibrium, since, from eq. (1 a),
lim [ar]t _ c (i. e., the relative equilibrium of the system).

solving for 2b and 2c gives k3 = (ab--c)/(k2[b]) and k4 = c/(kzx).
substituting in 2a and rearranging yield x k ~ - q k 2 + p = 0, where
p = a b - c + (c/x) and q = a + b. thus, the solution for k2 may be

0.5 [d + e + ]/(d + e)2--4(k,d + k2ka[b])
0.5 [d + e

in the experimental designs where observation of y(t) is intended,
there are three independent parameters which can be estimated using
eq. (1 a), while the number of unknown rate constants is four. the
problem can be eliminated only if one of the rate constants or the
equilibrium dissociation constant of agonist (k2/kl) or antagonist

it is thus proven that the estimated pa2 value using eq. (1 a) for
fixed concentrations of a, b and for a known ka, depends solely
on the relative value of the equilibrium regardless of the time course
of equilibration. that is, the value of kb or pa2 can be calculated
without estimating the rate constants, by substituting 1/(observed
relative equilibrium) for ab/c in eq. (3). in experiments where the
response is observed in lieu of the amounts of agonist-receptor
complex, one can empirically formulate relative equilibrium in terms
of the response parameters [i. e., slope factor (n) and median-effective
concentration ec5o (k)] in the following manner:
using the conventional logistic model relating [a] to response
(see kenakin 1984), equilibrium response in the absence of antagonist (ro) may be expressed as
[a]o

[a]"+ k" '

provided that k and n are estimated from concentration-response
curves. in the presence of a fixed concentration of competitive
antagonist with a known kb, response (r1) becomes

[a]"
r 1 =

[a]" + [k(1 + [b]/kb)]" '

assuming the invariance of equipotent concentration ratios with
respect to the actual form of stephenson's function (f)(null hypothesis) (stephenson 1956; arunlakshana and schild 1959; furchgott
1966). the relative value of equilibrium (eql) for a fixed concentration of agonist may be expressed as

substituting in eq. (3) and rearranging yields

the value of pa2 predicted using induced-response is designated by
pa~. it can be shown that an exact equivalence ofpa~ and pa2 for
all [a], [b] > 0 in eq. (4) is possible if and only if n = 1 and k = ka,
implying a complete linear relationship between receptor-occupancy
and response of agonist, which may not be considered as a realistic
assumption. on the other hand, tissues and agonists, possessing a
low extent of spare receptors, can be used to rationalize a linear
approximation, at least for certain concentration ranges of agouist
and antagonist. eq. (4) is helpful in optimizing the concentration of
agonist if the estimates of/ca, kb, k, and n are available from
independent experiments. otherwise, estimated rate constants will
be artificially biased due to the disturbance in equilibrium. simulated results of eq. (4) using the estimated response parameters of
indicated arteries are given in "results and discussion" together with
experimentally determined pa~ values. antagonist concentration,
on the other hand, is the primary determinant of reaction rate when
k2 > k4, which generally is the case (motulsky and mahan 1984).
lowering the reaction rate would increase the possibility of competition-limited in-vitro antagonism (clancy et al. 1987). effects of [a]
and [b] (agonist and antagonist concentrations) on the competition
rate are demonstrated in fig. 2 in a normalized scale, using the timedependent components of eq. (1 a). in order to retain the antagonist
activity for various [a], icx (antagonist concentration required to
displace x % of bounded agonist) of b was used instead of a fixed
[b]. these results suggest that [b] which possess low activity result
in a reduced-rate of overall reaction, whereas [a] is practically
irrelevant in competition rate. therefore, an optimization strategy
may be proposed as follows: agonist concentration may be searched
using eq. (4) with antagonist concentrations possessing a smallest
possible activity (considering the measurement conditions and interference of spontaneous fade of the steady-state response). eq. (4)
may be modified by substituting a generalized form of the cheng
and prusoff (1973) relation:
kb (1--~)
1 ([k~+
) ' 1)(0
c ~< c~<
for [b] in order to retain the antagonist activity at icx [x = 100(1 c~)]for various [a].

former case, and low potency in the latter. these arterial
segments were selected for their differing properties of
histaminergic (h1) responses and different thickness
of arterial wall. the orders of histamine potency (pd2)
and thickness are c i a > ta > a a ~ c c a and a a >
ta > c c a ~ cia, respectively. thus we have two combinations, one (aa, cca) possessing comparable susceptibility to h a with different thickness, and the other
(cca, cia) comparable thickness with different susceptibility.
estimated rate constants using these segments are
given in table 1. the rate constants were c o m p a r e d if the
corresponding kb were not significantly different f r o m
their expected values as determined in equilibrium experiments, since the rate constants are bounded by ks in a
manner that depends on the nature of the mathematical
f o r m used [eq. (1 a)]. in table 1, the rate constants calculated using a a and ta are significantly different from
those obtained using cca, and were found to be dependent on the concentration of antagonist. the nature of
this dependence was not investigated in the present study,
since it is expected that any behavior deviating from
eq. (1 a) should result in complicated effects on the estimated parameters. the nature and magnitude of these
effects still depend on the f o r m of eq. (1 a). two possibilities were considered at this point: first, that the ratedetermining step m a y be diffusion of antagonist through
the biophase; and second, that it m a y instead be the timedependence of stimulus-response coupling (f). clancy et
al. (1987) in their competition design for the rabbit thoracic aorta have assumed the time-independence of f. it
is not, however, possible to assume that a process of
chemical cascades is not time-dependent; rather, it should
be experimentally tested to ensure whether it indeed is
much faster than the competition reaction.

in the present study an indirect approach was considered: time-dependent decrease o f steady-state response to h a through hyperdilution was compared with
the rate of antagonism. it was observed that ta is able
to respond faster than it does in antagonism experiments
(fig. 3). fitting a first order decay equation to the data
obtained through hyperdilution in ta yields a dissociation rate constant o f 2 rain-1 which is close to that
obtained in c c a with antagonism experiments. in aa,
on the other hand, it was not possible to obtain faster
responses through hyperdilution, suggesting that f or
agonist back-diffusion may be a rate-determining step
along with antagonist diffusion. a diffusion-limited process, however, would more likely be due to the thickness
of the arterial wall, since diffusion rate constants are
inversely proportional to the square of width of the biophase (rubinow 1975). further evidence can be obtained
by comparing the data from c c a and ta. in fig. 4,
antagonism data in c c a and ta is given in a normalized
scale (with respect to relative equilibria). in ta, the antagonism pattern is clearly independent of antagonist concentration, while in c c a high-concentration bp yields a
relatively faster process (tl/2 is approximately halved). it
can be shown that a process o f passive diffusion is not
affected by the solute concentration when the volume o f

diffusion c o m p a r t m e n t (biophase) is very small compared
to that o f the medium initially containing the solute (organ bath), and that under these conditions the process is
determined solely by the "in to out" diffusion rate constant. the difference observed in cca, m a y be completely explained by the difference of antagonist concentration in eq. (1 a); that is, with c c a estimated rate
constants are independent of concentration of bp. nevertheless, it is suggested that kinetics in ta and a a are
limited by processes other than the competition reaction,
and that therefore it would seem to be impossible to
obtain kinetic information a b o u t the drug-receptor interaction, even when the pa2 values do not deviate f r o m
those estimated in binding or equilibrium experiments
(see table 2 for corresponding pa2 values).
estimated pa2 [ - log(kb)] values (as described above)
are given in table 2. the pa2 value of bp was estimated

results before and after incubation with phenoxybenzamine in fig. 6. estimated pa2 is 8.8 ___0.07 and k2, k3,
k 4 are 2.4, 0.2, 0.4 respectively, after phenoxybenzamine.
these values are completely consistent with those
obtained in cca, indicating the i m p o r t a n c e o f spare
receptors in such designs (not considered by clancy et al.
1987).
the reserve hypothesis was further supported using
the model, presented in methods as eq. (4), which implicitly describes the effect o f spare receptors on the estimated pa2 values. the model was simulated for a fixed
concentration of antagonist (10 nm) and variable concentration of agonist, using the following equilibrium
parameters (estimated in equilibrium experiments or
obtained from binding literature): k a ( h a ) = 30 gm,
kb(bp) = 2 nm, pde(cca) = 5.1, n(cca) = 1.1, pd2
(ta) = 5.5, n(ta) = 1.3, pdz(cia) = 6.1, n(cia) = 1.4
[where p d 2 - - -log(k)]. simulated results are given in
fig. 7 together with experimentally estimated pa2 values.
an excellent agreement is seen between observed and
predicted values. statistics o f the predicted values (originating from uncertainties in the parameters used) were
not investigated in the present study since the aim of the

simulations was to demonstrate the trends in pa2 values
depending on the agonist concentration, but not to test
the prediction power o f eq. (4). this modeling can also
shed light on the importance o f the agonist concentration
in such designs. in fig. 7, it is obvious that the experiments performed in high-reserve tissues are unreliable,
particularly for high concentrations of agonists. that is,
in the present design cca is the most favorable segment.

kinetics of antagonism in cca
rate constants of  xxxd3050xxx , (+)- xxxd375xxx ,
diphenhydramine and  xxxd186xxx  were estimated in cca
using a low concentration of h a (3 ~tm) which is found
to be optimum in cca) and low concentrations o f antagonists [5 and 10 nm for (+)- xxxd375xxx , 5 and
1 0 n m for  xxxd3050xxx , 100 and 3 0 0 n m for diphenhydramine and, 0.3 and 1 ixm for  xxxd186xxx ]. estimated rate constants were not found to be dependent on
the concentrations of antagonists (not shown). optimum
values for rate constants were therefore obtained from
constrained fittings (de lean et al. 1978); that is, data
from both concentrations of antagonists were fitted simultaneously by constraining the rate constants in
eq. (1 a) and using an indicator variable for different
concentrations of antagonists. results are given in
table 3. estimated pa2 [-- log(kb)] values are not signifi-
