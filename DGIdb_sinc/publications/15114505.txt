four prenylflavonoids, kurarinone (1), a chalcone of 1, kuraridin
(2), kurarinol (3), kushenol h (4) and kushenol k (5) isolated
from the roots of sophora flavescens were investigated for their
inhibitory effects on diacylglycerol acyltransferase (dgat). the
flavonoids inhibited dgat activity in a dose-dependent manner
with ic50 values of 10.9 mm (1), 9.8 mm (2), 8.6 mm (3), 142.0 mm
(4) and 250 mm (5). the prenylflavonoids without c3-oh (1, 2, 3)
showed stronger inhibition than those with c3-oh (4, 5). on the
other hand, flavonoids without side chains ( xxxd2272xxx , naringenin, quercetin and kaempferol) did not inhibit the enzyme activity at a final concentration of 800 mm. these data suggest that
the lavandulyl side chain and the position of the hydroxy group
are important for high dgat inhibitory activity. compound 1 also
inhibited de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (tg) in raji cells.

triacylglycerol (tg) is the main storage form of energy. on the
other hand, a high tg level is known to be one of the major risk
factors for coronary heart disease, obesity and hypertriglyceridemia [1]. tg synthesis has been assumed to occur primarily
through acyl coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (dgat), a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the final and only committed step
in the glycerol phosphate pathway [2]. therefore, dgat is considered as a potential target for the treatment of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes.
during our screening program for dgat inhibitors from natural
products, we have reported dgat inhibitors such as tanshinones
from the root of salvia miltiorrhiza and quinolone alkaloids from
evodia rutaecarpa [3], [4]. in continuation of these investigations, we examined the effects on dgat activity of prenylflavonoids 1 ± 5 from the root of sophora flavescens (table 1).

it was investigated whether 1 inhibited dgat in cells. the effect
of 1 on [1 ± 14c] xxxd2777xxx  incorporation into lipid fractions was determined using raji cells. compound 1 inhibited [1 ± 14c] xxxd2777xxx 
incorporation into tg in a dose-dependent fashion (table 2). tg
synthesis was profoundly blocked at a concentration of 3.0 mm
and completely blocked at a concentration of 10.0 mm of 1. this
result indicated that lipid synthesis from free long-chain fatty
acids was inhibited in raji cells by 1. in addition, a similar inhibitory effect of 1 on tg synthesis was observed in 3t3-l1 cells
(data not shown). in these experiments, at a concentration of
100 mm 1 was not cytotoxic to raji, 3t3-l1 and hl-60 cells (data
not shown). these findings indicated that 1 inhibited dgat enzyme activity also in the intact cells.

materials and methods
bovine  xxxg124xxx  and  xxxd690xxx ,2-dioleoylglycerol were obtained from sigma chemical co (st. louis. mo, usa); [1 ± 14c] xxxd2832xxx  coa and [1 ± 14c] xxxd2777xxx  were purchased from amersham. for
the cell culture, dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem), lglutamine, kanamycin sulfate, fetal bovine serum (fbs) were
purchased from gibco-brl (gaithersburg, md, usa).  xxxd2272xxx , naringenin, quercetin, and kaempferol were purchased from
sigma chemical co (st. louis, mo, usa). the roots of s. flavescens
were purchased from a herbal store in taejeon, korea. the authenticity of the plant was confirmed by k. h. bae, college of
pharmacy, chungnam national university. a voucher specimen
(pb-012 ± 012) has been deposited in the korea plant extract
bank, korea research institute of bioscience and biotechnology.

prenylflavonoids from sophora flavescens.

four prenylflavonoids named kurarinone (1), kurarinol (3), kushenol h (4), kushenol k (5) and a prenylchalcone, kuraridin (2)
were isolated from the root of sophora flavescens as reported previously [6]. the compounds were identified by direct comparison
of their physicochemical and spectroscopic data with those reported previously [6].

compounds 1, 2, and 3 exhibited relatively strong inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent fashion with ic50 values of 10.9 mm
(1), 9.8 mm (2) and 8.6 mm (3) (fig. 1). the inhibitory activity of
the compounds was comparable to that of  xxxd1765xxx ,
ic50 : 10.5 mg/ml [3]. to investigate the effect of prenylation on
dgat activity, prenylflavonoid derivatives 1 ± 5 (table 1) were
compared with the corresponding flavanones,  xxxd2272xxx  (6)
and naringenin (7) and the common flavonols, quercetin (8)
and kaempferol (9) [5]. flavonoids, 6 ± 9 did not inhibit dgat
at a concentration up to 800 mm (data not shown). the results
indicated that the lavandulyl side chain was important for
dgat inhibitory activity. the presence an oh group at c-3 (r1)

tg formation in raji cells was assayed as in the previous report
[8]. the human b lymphocyte cell line raji cells were obtained
from the american type culture collection (atcc; manassas,
va, usa), and grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
(dmem) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 60 mg/l kanamycin, 2 g/l sodium bicarbonate (sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo, usa) and 10 % fetal bovine serum (fbs). cells were maintained in a standard culture with humidified air containing 5 %
co2 at 37 8c. to the 3-day culture of raji cells (1  106 cells/ml)
suspended in 950 ml of pbs in a test tube (15  100 mm) were added 50 ml of [1 ± 14c] xxxd2777xxx  (700 pmol, 1.5  106 dpm) in pbs, and
the mixture was incubated at 37 8c. the cell suspension was
removed and 1.2 ml stop solution (chloroform:methanol, 2 : 1,
v/v) added. after addition of an equal of amount water, the lower
phase was transferred to a glass tube. total lipid charged on tlc
was separated using petroleum ether: xxxd2052xxx :acetic acid
(80 : 20 : 1, v/v/v) as developing solvent and the amount of radioactivity was determined in a bas reader (bas-1500, fujifilm)
[9].

the microsomal fractions of rat livers (male sprague-dawley
rats, 250 ± 300 g) were prepared and dgat activity was measured according to the method of coleman et al. [7]. the samples
were tested for dgat inhibitory activity in three independent experiments. all inhibitors were added as solutions in dmso. the
presence of dmso in assay medium at 2.5 % concentration had
no effect on the enzyme activity.
