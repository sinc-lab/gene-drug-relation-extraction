t-type, or low-voltage-activated, calcium channels are
characterized by a low threshold of activation, a small unitary conductance, and slow deactivation (fox et al., 1987a,b;
perez-reyes, 2003). t channels can be blocked or otherwise
modulated by multiple classes of drugs, including antiepileptics, antihypertensives, and anesthetics (heady et al., 2001).
verapamil is a clinically used phenylalkylamine antihypertensive that is believed to be somewhat selective for l-type
calcium channels in native tissues, with estimated ic50 values ranging from 600 nm in vascular smooth muscle (kuga et
al., 1990) to 3 ␮m in ventricular myocytes (nawrath and
wegener, 1997). however, the much greater ic50 values of
40.5 ␮m (dilmac et al., 2004) and 120 ␮m (motoike et al.,
1999) reported for l-type channels in heterologous expresthis work was supported by howard hughes undergraduate research

rapamil block of t channels. we stably expressed human
 xxxg307xxx  t-type channels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells
and studied the state-dependence of the drug with macroscopic and gating currents. verapamil blocked currents at micromolar concentrations at polarized potentials similar to those
reported for l-type channels, although unlike for l-type currents, it did not affect current time course. the drug exhibited
use-dependence and significantly slowed the apparent recovery from inactivation. current inhibition was dependent on potential. this dependence was restricted to negative potentials,
although all data were consistent with verapamil binding in the
pore. gating currents were unaffected by verapamil. we propose that verapamil achieves its inhibitory effect via occlusion
of the channel pore associated with an open/inactivated conformation of the channel.

sion systems suggest that the actual affinities in vivo may
be somewhat lower. verapamil has also been shown to
block t channels, with ic50 values of 30 ␮m in vascular
smooth muscle (kuga et al., 1990) and 70 ␮m in spermatogenic cells (arnoult et al., 1998). t channels, like l channels, seem to be blocked in a state-dependent manner
(nawrath and wegener, 1997; motoike et al., 1999; heady
et al., 2001; dilmac et al., 2004). because t-channel blockade has been implicated in the reduction of vascular tone
in vitro (boulanger et al., 1994; karila-cohen et al., 1996;
lam et al., 1998; vanbavel et al., 2002; jensen et al.,
2004), the interactions of verapamil with this channel may
prove to be therapeutically relevant.
selective stabilization of an inactivated state is the most
widely accepted explanation of how verapamil inhibits currents in l-type channels. block of l-type current is accompanied by prominent use-dependence, slowing of recovery
kinetics, and shift of the steady-state inactivation curve to
hyperpolarized potentials (nawrath and wegener, 1997; dilmac et al., 2004). multiple pore-lining residues of the l-type
channel have been implicated in phenylalkylamine binding

abstract
verapamil is a potent phenylalkylamine antihypertensive believed to exert its therapeutic effect primarily by blocking highvoltage-activated l-type calcium channels. it was the first clinically used calcium channel blocker and remains in clinical use,
although it has been eclipsed by other calcium channel blockers because of its short half-life and interactions with other
channels. in addition to blocking l-type channels, it has been
reported to block t-type (low-voltage activated) calcium channels. this type of cross-reactivity is likely to be beneficial in the
effective control of blood pressure. although the interactions of
t channels with a number of drugs have been described, the
mechanisms by which these agents modulate channel activity
are largely unknown. most calcium channel blockers exhibit
state-dependence (i.e., preferential binding to certain channel
conformations), but little is known about state-dependent ve-

and pcdna5/frt/to for transfection into flp-in t-rex-293 cells
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). stable cell lines were created using either 200 ␮g/ml zeocin (for hek-293 cells) or 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin

pipette solution contained 130 mm nacl, 10 mm hepes, 5 mm
mgatp, 1 mm cacl2, and 11 mm egta, titrated to ph 7.4 with 1 n
naoh. for experiments at ph 6.1, hepes was reduced to 5 mm,
egta was reduced to 1 mm, and 5 mm mes was added to the
solution. in some experiments, the pipette solution additionally contained 500 ␮m sodium-bapta, which improved seal resistances.
the addition of sodium-bapta had no effect on channel properties.

electrophysiological recordings and analysis. all experiments were performed on trypsinized cells (0.25% trypsin-edta;
invitrogen) 2 to 6 days after plating. whole-cell ionic current voltageclamp recordings were made using pclamp 8 software and axopatch-1d or axopatch-200b feedback amplifiers with digidata
1320a or 1322a interfaces (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
patch pipettes were pulled with a  xxxg2408xxx  micropipette puller (sutter

instruments, novato, ca) from tw 150-4 borosilicate (world precision instruments, sarasota, fl) or garner 8250 (garner glass co.,
claremont, ca) glass capillary tubes, and had resistances of 1.0 to
2.5 m⍀ when filled with pipette solution. data were filtered at 5 khz
by an eight-pole low-pass bessel filter and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  to 20 khz.
recordings were made at room temperature (20–26°c). currents
were additionally filtered at 1 khz offline. drug was applied to a
single chamber bath in which solutions were exchanged using the
cflow perfusion system (cell microcontrols, virginia beach, va) or
the sf77 perfusion fast-step system (warner instruments, hamden, ct). both methods of drug application yielded similar steadystate results.
gating currents were recorded in whole-cell mode using an axopatch 200b feedback amplifier with a national instruments digitalto-analog converter and labview 7.0 data acquisition software (national instruments corporation, austin, tx). patch pipettes were
pulled with a  xxxg2408xxx  micropipette puller (sutter instruments) from tw
150-4 borosilicate glass capillary tubes (world precision instruments) and had resistances of 1.0 to 4.0 m⍀ when filled with pipette
solution. data were filtered  xxxd1891xxx  khz using an eight-pole low-pass
bessel filter and sampled at 50 khz. four repetitions of each voltage
step were performed 1⁄4 of 60 hz out of phase and averaged to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio. linear capacitative currents were
subtracted from the current measurements using 40-mv hyperpolarizing steps to voltages at which no gating charge was expected to
move (⫺120 to ⫺160 mv). the gating currents were integrated to
determine gating charge.

results
verapamil affinity for cloned t-type and l-type
channels is comparable. we studied the splice variant of
 xxxg307xxx  that is most abundantly expressed in adult human
brain. it differs from the original clone (perez-reyes et al.,
1998) in that it is human and includes one additional exon
(14), a short segment in the domain i to ii linker. it is
electrophysiologically similar to the clone without exon 14
(proteins paper, in press). by expressing this channel in a
heterologous system, we were able to determine verapamil
affinity with minimal interference by other conductances. we
estimated a lower bound for verapamil affinity by measuring
the inhibition of peak currents under conditions in which
channels were fully available at the holding potential, fully
activated at the current-eliciting potential, and the duration
between consecutive pulses was long. channels depolarized
from ⫺130 to ⫺10 mv at a frequency of 0.2 hz exhibited an
ic50 of 21.4 ␮m, a value less than the affinities of 40.5 and
120 ␮m reported for low-frequency stimulation of l-type
channels in heterologous systems (motoike et al., 1999; dilmac et al., 2004) and similar to the values previously reported for t channels in native tissues (kuga et al., 1990;
arnoult et al., 1998). the experimental data were fit well by
a single-site binding curve, suggesting that drug binding was
not a cooperative process (fig. 1). although verapamil has
been reported to speed the decay of l-type currents (hockerman et al., 1995, 1997; johnson et al., 1996; nawrath and
wegener, 1997; motoike et al., 1999; dilmac et al., 2004), it
did not affect the t-channel current time course.

et al., 1999; dilmac et al., 2004), suggesting that the highaffinity binding site is located in the pore.
as is the case for many t-channel blockers, the detailed
process by which verapamil inhibits t-channel currents is
not known. in the present study, we sought to elucidate the
mechanism by which verapamil blocks the t-type calcium
channel. we expressed a common splice variant of the human
 xxxg307xxx  t-type channel in hek-293 cells and examined the
effects of verapamil on macroscopic and gating currents. the
drug blocked macroscopic currents at micromolar concentrations but did not affect current time course. verapamil
slowed recovery from inactivation and blocked current in a
use- and holding potential-dependent fashion. the drug competed with the permeant ion, suggesting that it bound in the
pore. however, block was unaffected by the current-eliciting
potential.  xxxg307xxx  gating currents were also unaltered in the
presence of verapamil, suggesting that the drug does not
affect normal gating of the channel, despite its ability to
inhibit ionic currents. this finding and our macroscopic data
strongly suggest that verapamil inhibits currents by occlusion of the conduction pathway in open and inactivated conformations of the channel.

block was use-dependent. many calcium channel
blockers more effectively inhibit currents when channels are
depolarized at high frequencies as a result of enhanced access to high-affinity binding states. it has been reported that
verapamil exhibits such use-dependent block of t channels
(arnoult et al., 1998) in mouse spermatogenic cells but not in
rat aortic smooth muscle cells (kuga et al., 1990). to assess
whether verapamil blocks the cloned channel in a use-dependent fashion, we subjected cells to trains of 100-ms steps to
⫺10 mv interspersed by variable duration hyperpolarizations to ⫺130 mv (fig. 2). verapamil (10 ␮m) blocked ⬃25%
of the peak current when channels recovered for either 9900
or 4900 ms between consecutive depolarizations. when the
recovery interval was reduced to 400 ms, block significantly
increased to 51%, and verapamil blocked 69% of the peak
current when channels were allowed to recover for only 100
ms between depolarizations. the prominent use-dependence
of block indicated that verapamil preferentially bound to
channel states entered upon membrane depolarization.
verapamil slowed recovery from fast inactivation.
the use-dependence of verapamil block suggested that the
drug would slow the apparent rate of recovery from fast
inactivation as well. we applied dual 50-ms pulses to ⫺10
mv separated by variable duration steps to ⫺130 mv to
quantify the effect of verapamil on recovery kinetics. as
expected, verapamil slowed recovery from fast inactivation in
a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3). in the absence of drug
(control), the time course of recovery was well described by a
biexponential function (hering et al., 2004) with time constants of ␶fast ⫽ 52 ms and ␶slow ⫽ 233 ms. upon the addition
of 10 ␮m verapamil, ␶fast increased only slightly to 87 ms,
whereas ␶slow increased 7-fold to 1671 ms (fig. 3, inset).
when the drug concentration was increased from 10 to 50
␮m, there were no significant changes in the values of the
exponential time constants. however, the amplitude of the
slow component significantly increased, and the amplitude of

followed by a variable duration recovery interval at ⫺130 mv (the length

second 50-ms step to ⫺10 mv to assay for remaining current. after each
application of the dual-pulse protocol, membranes were hyperpolarized to

tion time) was due primarily to differential drug access to
high-affinity-inactivated states of the channel.
verapamil did not target the fast-inactivated state
during short depolarizations. because verapamil binding to inactivated states was substantial during prolonged
depolarization, we sought to determine whether inactivated
state binding was a major contributor to inhibition on the
time scale of the current. to this end, we exposed cells to
trains of depolarizations from ⫺130 to ⫺10 mv, for which the
time at ⫺130 mv was held constant at 200 ms across all
experimental conditions, and the time at ⫺10 mv was varied
from 6 to 50 ms. a 6-ms step resulted in a small proportion
(⬃10%) of channels entering the inactivated state. the proportion of channels that inactivated increased as the step
duration was lengthened; a 50-ms step inactivated nearly the
entire population of channels. we expected that if verapamil
selectively stabilized the fast-inactivated state of the channel, the degree of block would increase with the proportion of
channels entering the state during depolarization. however,
one-way anova indicated that there were no significant
differences in the fractional block of current across step durations (fig. 5), demonstrating that access to the fast-inactivated state was unimportant in verapamil binding when
channels were depolarized for such short durations.
verapamil interacted with the permeant ion. it has
been reported that verapamil accesses its binding site from
the intracellular space and binds in the pore of both l-type
ca2⫹ channels and k⫹ channels (decoursey, 1995; johnson
et al., 1996; robe and grissmer, 2000; dilmac et al., 2004).
we hypothesized that verapamil would also bind in the pore
of the t channel and predicted that it would compete with the
permeant ion for a binding site. in the presence of 0.5 mm
extracellular ca2⫹, 10 ␮m verapamil blocked 35% of the peak
current under 0.2 hz stimulation (fig. 6). consistent with
our prediction, increasing the ca2⫹ concentration to 2 mm
significantly reduced block to 26%. in 5 mm ca2⫹, block was
not significantly different from the value at 2 mm, indicating
that verapamil only effectively competed with ca2⫹ at relatively low ca2⫹ concentrations.
the drug also more effectively competed with ba2⫹ than
with ca2⫹ for a binding site. verapamil (10 ␮m) blocked 42%
of peak current in 2 mm ba2⫹, which was significantly
greater than the 26% block observed in 2 mm ca2⫹. block
was significantly reduced to 24% at 5 mm ba2⫹. as was the
case with ca2⫹, the competitive effect seemed to saturate at
relatively low concentrations of ba2⫹: in 10 mm ba2⫹, block
was not statistically different from the value at 5 mm.
block was voltage-independent. at intracellular ph
7.4, ⬃94% of verapamil molecules bear a positive charge
because of protonation of their tertiary amino groups (pka
8.6; budavari, 1996). therefore, we expected that if verapamil bound at a pore site within the transmembrane field,
block would depend on the voltage of the current-eliciting
depolarization. we evaluated this hypothesis by depolarizing
cells at 0.2 hz from ⫺130 mv to a wide range of potentials in
the presence and absence of 10 ␮m verapamil. under control
conditions, the activation curve was described by a single
boltzmann function with a halfpoint of ⫺57 mv and slope
factor of e-fold/4.9 mv. we were surprised to find that the
activation curve was unaffected by drug (10 ␮m verapamil:
v1/2 ⫽ ⫺59 mv, slope factor ⫽ e-fold/5.5 mv; 50 ␮m vera-

that enhanced block at positive potentials instead resulted
from preferential binding to some other state.
to assess whether the holding potential effect resulted
mainly from drug binding to inactivated channels, we used a
fast perfusion system to selectively administer 10 ␮m verapamil to inactivated channels. a 200-ms conditioning pulse
was applied to inactivate channels in the absence of drug,
followed by ⬃800-ms application of 10 ␮m verapamil at the
conditioning potential. cells were then removed from drug
and repolarized to ⫺130 mv for 100 ms, an interval sufficient
to recover a large fraction of unblocked but not blocked channels (fig. 3). a subsequent 50-ms step to ⫺10 mv served as
an assay for the remaining current. in the absence of drug,
the fractional availability of channels under these recording
conditions (fig. 4b) decreased with conditioning potential at
negative voltages and reached a plateau at voltages positive
to ⫺70 mv. when the fast perfusion system was used to
precisely control drug application (fig. 4c) during the voltage protocol, verapamil more potently blocked channels at
depolarized potentials, with fractional block (fig. 4d) tracking very tightly with channel availability (fig. 4b). this
finding strongly suggested that the voltage-dependence of
verapamil inhibition under these conditions (⬃1 s inactivation time) and under steady-state conditions (⬃5 s inactiva-

test the latter hypothesis, we lowered intracellular ph from
7.4 to 6.1. we calculated that the resultant ph gradient from
cytoplasmic space to bath caused an approximately 20-fold
increase in the intracellular concentration of charged drug,
relative to the concentration at intracellular ph 7.4. therefore, if charged verapamil was the primary active species of
drug, block at acidic ph should have been as much as 20-fold
greater than block at ph 7.4. inconsistent with this hypothesis, verapamil blocked 45% of peak current under 0.2 hz
stimulation, less than 2-fold greater than the 26% block
observed at intracellular ph 7.4. the moderate increase in
fractional block compared with ph 7.4 suggests that the
charged form may make a relatively minor contribution to
the inhibitory effects of verapamil or that titration of ionizable channel residues increases affinity for the drug. usedependent block was not substantially altered either: under
5-hz stimulation, verapamil blocked 72% of peak current, a
value very similar to the 68% block at ph 7.4 (fig. 8b).

remaining current. these currents were normalized to control currents elicited under conditions of maximal availability (50-ms steps to ⫺10 mv from a
holding potential of ⫺130 mv; data not shown). c, representative drug wash-on and wash-off kinetics using a fast perfusion system (also used in d) to expose
channels to either control solution or 10 ␮m verapamil. this cell was repetitively depolarized to ⫺10 mv for 100 ms and hyperpolarized to ⫺130 mv for 400
ms between depolarizing steps. because perfusion kinetics were very rapid, precise temporal control of drug application was possible in d. d, the holding
potential dependence of drug block remained when inactivated channels were selectively exposed to 10 ␮m verapamil (n ⫽ 4). for each conditioning
potential, the voltage protocol in b was first applied in the absence of drug. to determine the fractional block of current at that potential, the inset voltage
protocol was then applied. drug exposure commenced after the initial 200-ms interval at the conditioning potential and terminated just before the
repolarization of the membrane to ⫺130 mv. fractional block at each potential was calculated by normalizing the current elicited by the vtest pulse in the
presence of verapamil to the current elicited by vtest in the absence of drug. the duration between consecutive prepulses was ⬃4 s to allow for full channel
recovery. wash-off kinetics between prepulses were more rapid than in c, and cumulative drug effects did not occur. the voltage dependence of fractional
block closely resembles the voltage dependence of channel availability in b.

pamil: v1/2 ⫽ ⫺56 mv, slope factor ⫽ e-fold/5.2 mv), indicating that block was a voltage-independent process (fig. 7a).
given this result, we hypothesized that use-dependent
block would be voltage-independent as well. to test this, we
used a voltage protocol consisting of 100-ms steps to either
⫺10 or ⫹80 mv, followed by 100-ms repolarizations to ⫺130
mv. as predicted, the fractional block of current by 10 ␮m
verapamil was unaffected by the current-eliciting voltagestep (68 ⫾ 3% inhibition at ⫺10 mv, 58 ⫾ 3% inhibition at
⫹80 mv; p ⬎ 0.05) (fig. 7b), despite the 90-mv difference in
membrane potential.
the active form of verapamil was uncharged. the
voltage-independence of block was initially puzzling because
of the large proportion of charged drug molecules and the
probable location of the binding site within the pore of the
channel. we reasoned that either the binding site was outside of the transmembrane field or that the neutral form of

given the ability of verapamil to effectively inhibit ionic
currents, we wanted to determine whether the drug could
also modulate voltage sensor movement. many drug classes,
including dihydropyridines (hadley and lederer, 1995) and
local anesthetics (sheets and hanck, 2003), alter the movement of the gating charge in their target channels, an effect
that probably contributes to their inhibitory properties. to
test whether verapamil altered charge transfer, we measured
on-gating currents and charge in the presence of 500 ␮m
la3⫹ to block ionic current. cells were held at ⫺120 mv and
depolarized for 75 ms over a large voltage range (⫺120 to

discussion
t-type channels have been widely implicated in the control
of vascular tone and blood pressure. multiple studies have
shown that t-channel inhibition is associated with the reduction of vascular smooth muscle tone in native tissues (boulanger et al., 1994; karila-cohen et al., 1996; lam et al.,
1998; vanbavel et al., 2002; jensen et al., 2004). t-channel
blockade has been implicated in the successful treatment
of hypertension.  xxxd2638xxx , a selective t-channel blocker
(mehrke et al., 1994; mishra and hermsmeyer, 1994; clozel
et al., 1997; martin et al., 2000), exhibited favorable antihypertensive properties with minimal negative inotropic effects
before its withdrawal from the market because of lethal drug
interactions involving p450 cytochrome metabolism (welker
et al., 1998).
two studies have challenged the notion that t-channel
blockade promotes vasodilation. chen et al. (2003) showed
that  xxxg308xxx  knockout mice paradoxically exhibited aberrant
coronary arteriole constriction. up-regulation of high-voltage-activated ca2⫹ channels was probably not the cause of
the constitutive vasoconstriction, but another compensatory
mechanism may account for the unexpected  xxxg308xxx ⫺/⫺ phenotype. more recently, moosmang and colleagues (2003) generated a vascular smooth muscle-specific knockout of the
 xxxg304xxx  l-type channel, which they reported was unrespon-

control (v1/2 ⫽ ⫺22.4 mv, slope factor ⫽ e-fold/19.6 mv), demonstrating
that verapamil did not alter gating charge movement. ionic currents were

representative charge integrals for a single cell under control
conditions and in the presence of 500 ␮m verapamil. the
estimated verapamil ic50 value for ica was probably less
than 20 ␮m under these conditions; therefore, 500 ␮m was a
saturating concentration sufficient to block greater than 96%
of channels.
there were no discernible differences in the on-gating
currents or charge integrals between the control and drug
conditions. for each cell, charge measured at each voltage
was normalized to the maximum charge (qmax) determined
from the boltzmann fit of the data. charge versus voltage
(q-v) relationships normalized to the qmax under control
conditions (fig. 9) demonstrate that verapamil did not
change the amount of charge that was moved upon depolarization. maximal charge was also unaffected when gating
currents were measured in 500 ␮m verapamil in the absence
of la3⫹ (data not shown). fits from the q-v relationships
measured under control conditions yielded a voltage halfpoint (v1/2) of ⫺20 mv and a slope factor of e-fold/17.2 mv.
the q-v curve was shifted to potentials positive to those
sufficient to elicit ionic current probably because of a substantial surface charge effect exerted by extracellular la3⫹, a

state-dependent verapamil block of  xxxg307xxx 

(decoursey, 1995; catacuzzeno et al., 1999; robe and grissmer, 2000); in addition, the drug unbinding reaction could
not be observed in the tail currents (data not shown) as in k⫹
channels (decoursey, 1995; catacuzzeno et al., 1999; robe
and grissmer, 2000).
the dependence on holding potential was strongly suggestive of high-affinity drug binding to an inactivated state of
the channel. consistent with that hypothesis, selective application of drug to inactivated channels produced a similar
voltage dependence of block to that observed under equilibrium conditions. because t-channels were substantially
blocked by verapamil at potentials near the resting potential
of vascular smooth muscle cells, this effect may be relevant to
the drug’s therapeutic profile. the finding that block was
unaffected by the duration of short voltage steps (up to 50
ms) indicates that inactivated-state drug binding is significant only when channels dwell in this state for longer periods. it is plausible that inhibition of current during short
voltage steps was due primarily to blockade of the open state
of the channel, possibly followed by drug-induced conversion
of the channel to a high-affinity-inactivated state.
the ability of verapamil to compete with both ba2⫹ and
ca2⫹ implies that the binding site is located within the pore
of the channel, as has been suggested for l-type channels and
k⫹ channels. evidence that ca2⫹ binds more tightly to the
selectivity filter than ba2⫹ does (serrano et al., 2000) may
explain the observation that verapamil more effectively competes with ba2⫹ than with ca2⫹. it is noteworthy that block
of l channels is more effective in ca2⫹ than in ba2⫹, a
phenomenon that may result from verapamil interaction
with the ca2⫹-dependent inactivation process in these channels (dilmac et al., 2004).
the observation that verapamil block was independent of
the current-eliciting potential was unexpected but is consistent with results obtained for verapamil block of k⫹ channels
(decoursey, 1995; robe and grissmer, 2000). one possibility
is that verapamil binds outside of the transmembrane electric field. however, when we selectively increased the cytoplasmic concentration of charged drug by lowering intracellular ph, drug block was not substantially enhanced. this
finding suggested that the primary active species of drug was
probably the uncharged form, which may bind within the
field (in the pore) with no observable voltage-dependence. a
similar mechanism has been proposed for verapamil inhibition of k⫹ channels (decoursey, 1995; catacuzzeno et al.,
1999; robe and grissmer, 2000).
voltage-dependent block of the open state at positive potentials would have been expected in single depolarizations if
binding/unbinding were rapid or in trains of depolarizations
if the interactions of the charged drug with the channel were
slow. the absence of any such evidence argues against
charged species blocking the open state. likewise, the absence of a voltage-dependence of block at potentials positive
to ⫺70 mv during long depolarizations in which inactivated
channels were selectively exposed to drug (fig. 4d) also argues against the charged drug as the primary active species.
voltage-dependent partitioning of channels from closed
states into inactivated states, rather than an interaction of
the drug with the transmembrane field, probably accounts
for the voltage-dependence of block observed at more negative potentials (fig. 4, b and d).
the absence of a verapamil effect on-gating currents and

sive to  xxxd2638xxx  (moosmang et al., 2006). although the
authors concluded that  xxxd2638xxx  achieves its in vivo action
by blocking  xxxg304xxx , t channels are the preferential target in
vitro (boulanger et al., 1994; karila-cohen et al., 1996; lam
et al., 1998; vanbavel et al., 2002; jensen et al., 2004). it may
be that t channels modulate l-type channel-mediated calcium influx rather than directly controlling vascular tone.
because t channels open in response to small membrane
depolarizations, their activation can further depolarize the
membrane and promote l-channel activation and vasoconstriction. the lack of a  xxxd2638xxx  effect on  xxxg304xxx ⫺/⫺ mice is
consistent with this hypothesis, because t-channel modulation of l channels would have been ablated along with the l
channel itself, even if the drug potently inhibited t channels.
despite reports that verapamil is selective for l channels,
our data demonstrate that it inhibits t-channel currents in
the same concentration range needed to block heterologously
expressed l-type channels (motoike et al., 1999; dilmac et
al., 2004). the experimental manipulations necessary to separate t-type from l-type currents in native tissues may
account for the reported disparities in drug affinity in these
studies (kuga et al., 1990). the ability of verapamil to inhibit
both t-type and l-type channels in approximately the same
concentration range suggests that blockade of both channels
may contribute to its potent therapeutic effects, including
blood pressure reduction and amelioration of reperfusion
tachyarrhythmias (kato et al., 2004) and paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias (pritchett, 2004). several studies have also suggested that block of l-type and t-type channels may contribute to effective control of electrical
remodeling occurring with atrial fibrillation and tachycardia
(fareh et al., 1999, 2001; ohashi et al., 2004).
like other calcium channel blockers, verapamil blocks both
l-type and t-type channels in a state-dependent manner
(nawrath and wegener, 1997; motoike et al., 1999; heady et
al., 2001; dilmac et al., 2004). this feature is crucial from a
clinical perspective, because the therapeutic effects of a drug
are greatly influenced by the set of channel states that it
preferentially targets. clarifying the state-dependence of verapamil block of t channels is necessary to understand how
verapamil achieves its in vivo effects, particularly because
verapamil cross-reacts with multiple channel targets. in the
present study, we used both whole-cell voltage-clamp and
gating current measurements to systematically investigate
the state-dependence of t-channel inhibition by verapamil.
by expressing channels in hek cells, we were able to study
verapamil block of t-channels with minimal contamination
by endogenous conductances, a significant obstacle in native
tissues.
using whole-cell voltage clamp, we showed that verapamil
exhibited a moderate use-dependence and induced a dramatic slowing of recovery kinetics, features also observed in
l channels (johnson et al., 1996; dilmac et al., 2004). the
slow recovery kinetics indicate that verapamil is capable of
inhibiting t channels over a time course much longer than
that of the action potential, a feature which may be important in vivo. however, the lack of a substantial drug effect on
the time course of t-channel currents suggests that the kinetics of inhibition are distinct from those observed for other
channel targets. it is noteworthy that verapamil did not
accelerate current decay as has been reported in l channels
(johnson et al., 1996; dilmac et al., 2004) and k⫹ channels

charge suggests that it inhibits currents simply by occlusion
of the conduction pathway. stabilization of a channel conformation by an antagonist is usually accompanied by alteration of gating currents, as in the cases of lidocaine inhibition
of na⫹ channels (sheets and hanck, 2003) and nifedipine
inhibition of l-type ca2⫹ channels (hadley and lederer,
1995). because the t channel seems to gate normally, even in
the presence of a saturating concentration of verapamil (500
␮m), it is unlikely that the drug inhibits currents via a
mechanism involving immobilization of the gating charge.
however, it is possible that verapamil does allosterically
stabilize a channel pore conformation in a manner that does
not significantly affect voltage sensor movement.
further work on the state-dependence of verapamil action,
along with identification of high-affinity binding residues,
are necessary steps toward understanding how phenylalkylamines modulate t-type channels in vivo. a complete understanding of how these important compounds affect t channels can refine the ways in which they are used clinically and
guide the rational design of effective t-channel-selective
drugs in the future.
