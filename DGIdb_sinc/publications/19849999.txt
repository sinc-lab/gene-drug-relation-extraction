there is currently a need for a method capable of measuring the activity and inhibition of biologically relevant oxygenases in a format that enables the convenient, fast, and cost-efﬁcient generation of dose–
response information. here we describe a low-volume luminescence-based assay for the measurement
of such oxygen-dependent enzymes. the assay employs a photoluminescent oxygen-sensitive probe
and glass capillary microcuvettes measured on the roche lightcycler detection platform. three discrete
types of oxygen probe were evaluated for this application: (i) solid-state coatings, (ii) soluble macromolecular mitoxpress probe, both phosphorescent porphyrin-based, and (iii) a luminescent ir(iii)-based
nanoparticle probe. measurement parameters were optimised and subsequently applied to the analysis
of three biologically relevant oxygenases, namely cytochrome p450 (cyp), monoamine oxygenase (mao),
and cyclooxygenase (cox). cyp enzymes are central players in drug detoxiﬁcation while speciﬁc inhibitors of mao and cox are important for therapeutic intervention and treatment of neurological and
inﬂammatory diseases, respectively. to determine assay utility, oxygen consumption catalysed by all
three enzyme types was measured and the effect of speciﬁc inhibitors determined. the panel included
the mao-a/b inhibitors  xxxd1730xxx , toloxatone, deprenyl, and the cox-1/2 inhibitors niﬂumic acid,
 xxxd2727xxx , sc-560,  xxxd2423xxx , and phenylbutazone. ic50 values were then compared with literature values. the measurement methodology described allows the low-volume analysis of biologically relevant
oxygenases and displays the requisite sensitivity and throughput to facilitate routine analysis. it is also
applicable to other o2-dependent enzymes and enzymatic systems.

oxygen-consuming enzymes play a central role in many important biochemical pathways and have therefore become the focus of
attention both as drug targets and as players in drug metabolism.
important examples receiving attention currently include the
monoamine oxidase (mao)1, cytochrome p450 (cyp450), and cycloxygenase (cox) families of oxidases.
maos are ﬂavoprotein enzymes located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. their main function is to inactivate dietary
amines and neurotransmitters such as serotonin or dopamine [1].
abnormal mao activity is implicated in neurological disorders
[2,3], conditions that can be treated with mao inhibitors. thus,
the mao-b inhibitor deprenyl (phenyl-isopropyl-methyl-propargylamine) is used in the treatment of parkinson disease [4]; mao
a inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx  [5] inhibits succinate-dependent h2o2 release [6]. cyp450 are important phase 1 enzymes involved in the

oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. cyp inhibition and induction
are being examined earlier in the drug discovery process in an effort to reduce attrition rates [7]. cox, or prostaglandin endoperoxide h synthase, catalyses the oxidation of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) to
prostaglandin h2 (pgh2) [8,9]. nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (nsaids) compete directly with aa, thereby inhibiting cox
activity [8]. thus, niﬂumic acid selectively inhibits cox-2 [9], phenylbutazone inhibits cox peroxidase activity [10], and sc-560
(diaryl heterocycle) inhibits both cox-1 and cox-2 [11].
known modulators of mao and cox activity often show undesirable side effects [12], thus stimulating the search for new compounds and analytical systems for their monitoring. techniques
such as thin layer chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and
high-performance liquid chromatography have been used for analysis of cox and mao [13–15]. the microtitre plate assays providing higher throughput and convenience offer certain advantages
and therefore are ﬁnding widespread use. examples include ﬂuorogenic cyp substrates [16], mao-glo (www.promega.com), a homogeneous luciferase-coupled luminescence method, and the amplex
red (dihydroresoruﬁn) method which detects mao-catalysed h2o2

production [17]. although sensitive, these methods are indirect
and often involve coupled reactions, thereby increasing assay complexity and complicating data interpretation. direct measurement
of enzymatic oxygen consumption is an attractive alternative
which simpliﬁes the assay procedure. polarographic clark-type
oxygen electrodes have been used for such measurements [18–
20]; however, they do not provide the necessary throughout or
convenience. these limitations can be circumvented through the
use of quenched-ﬂuorescence oxygen sensing [21–23].
development of a simple, sensitive, and robust respirometric
assay requires rational selection of the appropriate probe, measurement format, and detection platform, and subsequent optimisation of the assay parameters to ensure optimal performance.
probes based on phosphorescent pt(ii)-porphyrins have proved
their utility for o2 sensing [24], working well within the whole
physiological range (0–250 lm) of dissolved o2. more recently
ir(iii)-coumarin complexes displaying bright emission and nearoptimal sensitivity to o2 have been introduced [25]. regarding
the measurement format, microplate systems are compatible with
existing detection and liquid handling platforms [23]. however,
due to the nonoptimal protection from ambient oxygen, their sensitivity is compromised. a more sensitive option is provided by the
lightcycler system. originally developed for quantitative pcr, this
system uses narrow-bore glass capillary cuvettes measured on a 48
sample carousel using blue led excitation (470 nm) and three
detection channels (green 530 nm, red 640 nm, and far-red
705 nm). the use of glass capillaries allied to excellent temperature
control provides a more sensitive and accurate platform for o2 consumption measurements [23].
in this study, we apply the lightcycler platform to develop a
sensitive assay for the monitoring of oxygen-dependent enzymatic
reactions. three different o2-sensitive materials were evaluated
comparatively: (i) solid-state pt-tetrakis(pentaﬂuorophenyl) porphine-based coatings [26], (ii) a soluble pt-coproporphyrin-based
macromolecular probe, mitoxpress [27], and (iii) a nanoparticle
probe based on the iridium(iii) coumarin dye, ir(cs)2(acac) [28].
measurement parameters were optimised and subsequently applied to the analysis of three biologically relevant oxygenases,
namely cyp450, mao, and cox, and the effects of speciﬁc inhibitors determined.

materials and methods
materials
human recombinant mao a (5 mg/ml, 405 u/ml) and b (5 mg/
ml, 190 u/ml) both produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells
and cox-1 from sheep (0.21 mg/ml, 45 ku/ml), cox-2 human
(0.45 mg/ml, 7 ku/ml), glucose oxidase ( xxxg1017xxx ) produced from
aspergillus niger, and all substrates and inhibitors were from sigma-aldrich (ireland). cyp1a2 and supermix microsomes were
from bd gentest. the 20-ll lightcycler capillaries were from
roche (us). ethyl acetate was from rathburn chemicals (scotland).
te buffer (0.1 m tris–hcl and 10 mm edta) was from sigma-aldrich (ireland) and tehp buffer contained 1 lm hemoglobin and
2 mm phenol.
the mitoxpress probe was from luxcel biosciences (ireland).
one 10 package of the probe was reconstituted in 100 ll of assay
medium and used at a working concentration of 5 lm. the nanoparticle probe comprising the polystyrene-poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(ps-pvp) block-co-polymer nanobeads (aldrich) impregnated with
ir(cs)2(acac) (1.5% w/w) was prepared as described previously [29].
probe stock solution (10 mg/ml) was diluted with assay medium to
the required working concentration. the solid-state coatings were
prepared by dissolving pttfpp dye (frontier scientiﬁc, usa) (0.1–

145

0.5 mg/ml) in 1–5% w/w solution of polystyrene (ps) in ethyl acetate, quickly pipetting aliquots of this coating cocktail into glass
capillaries and centrifuging them for 30 s at 1000 rpm to bring
the cocktail to the bottom of the capillary. the capillaries were
then dried under reduced pressure to form an o2-sensitive coating.
optical measurements
uv–vis absorption spectra of the probes (range 250–650 nm)
were measured on an hp8453 diode array spectrometer (agilent,
usa) in a 1-cm quartz cell. excitation and emission spectra were
measured on an ls-50b luminescence spectrometer (perkin elmer,
usa). for spectra analysis, the solid-state pttfpp-ps probe was
spotted on polyester foil. deoxygenation was achieved using a sodium sulﬁte solution (5 mg/ml of kh2po4 in 7 mg/ml na2so3).
measuring enzymatic oxygen consumption
enzymatic oxygen consumption measurements were performed in pb, ph 7 ( xxxg1017xxx ), 100 mm pb, ph 7.4 (for mao a/b),
0.1 mm tehp buffer, ph 8 (for cox-1/2), or in 100 mm k-phosphate (ph 7.4) containing 1.3 mm nadp+, 3.3 mm  xxxd1292xxx , 1.6 u/ml  xxxg825xxx , and 3.3 mm
 xxxd2532xxx  (for cyp).
oxygen probe, enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor where necessary were mixed, with substrate added as the last component to
initiate the reaction. the 20-ll aliquots were spin-loaded into glass
capillaries (1000g for 30 s) and, where indicated, an additional 5 ll
of  xxxd2648xxx  was spin-loaded to reduce diffusion of atmospheric
oxygen into the sample. oxygen consumption measurements were
performed by taking phosphorescence intensity readings on the
lightcycler (roche, us) at regular intervals over a 30- to 120-min
period. all enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °c.
data processing
measured time proﬁles of probe signal were processed using
the previously published algorithm [30], to determine relative
rates of o2 consumption. brieﬂy, raw ﬂuorescent proﬁles were normalized for the initial intensity and transformed into linear scale.
the following analytical relationship therefore applies.

iðt 0 þ
1 þ k sv ½o2 ðt 0 
¼
iðtþ  iðt0
k sv k2 ½et

ð1þ

where i(t0) and i(t) represent initial phosphorescence signal and the
signal at time t, ksv represents the stern-volmer quenching constant
of the probe, [o2(t0)] represents the initial, air-saturated, dissolved
oxygen concentration, while k2 and [e] represent the catalytic constant and enzyme concentration, respectively. this relationship allows linearization of raw phosphorescence proﬁles (using double
reciprocal plots [31]), with inversed slopes (1/sn) of transformed
proﬁles proportional to the reaction rate. these values were used
for the assessment of enzyme activity and inhibition. ic50 values
were calculated using origin 6.0 (microcal).
results
photophysical characterization of the o2-sensitive materials
spectral characteristics of the three o2-sensitive materials are
shown in fig. 1. both the mitoxpress probe and the pttfpp-ps coatings have strong excitation bands in the 360–400 nm range (the
soret band), several minor excitation bands in the visible range
(500–550 nm), and both emit at 650 nm. the particulate
ir(cs)2(acac)-based probe is excitable at 350–495 nm and emits

nal instability with a baseline ﬂuorescent signal decrease of 10–
12% per hour. in contrast both mitoxpress and pttfpp coatings
show no signiﬁcant signal drift (see fig. 3). these observations reﬂect the superior compatibility of the ir(cs)2(acac)-based probe
with the lightcycler excitation source and are consistent with previous data showing high brightness but moderate photostability of
the ir(cs)2(acac) dye [29]. the addition of a  xxxd2648xxx  seal atop
the sample (a seal from ambient oxygen) improved the signal stability of the ir(cs)2(acac) probe (fig. 3) and also stabilised the signal during the monitoring of enzymatic reactions (see below). a
 xxxd2648xxx  seal was therefore used in all subsequent experiments
with enzymatic reactions.
the ﬂuorescence response of the probes to deoxygenation was
evaluated by comparing their signals under air-saturated and
deoxygenated conditions at various temperatures. probe responses
are summarised in table 1. probe signal decreases with increasing
temperature, an effect which is reduced under deoxygenated conditions due to the absence of molecular oxygen as a collisional
quencher. based on these data, all three probes appear suitable
for oxygen consumption-related applications performed on the
lightcycler.

between 550 and 650 nm. it is therefore more compatible with the
blue led excitation used on the lightcycler instrument.
use of the pttfpp-ps probe required optimisation of dye and
polymer concentration and the coating procedure. polymer concentrations of <3% w/w were found optimal for spin loading and
coating of the glass capillaries. fig. 2 shows the effect of increasing
concentrations of pttfpp in the coating cocktail on the signals measured at 640 nm. for subsequent experiments, 3 ll loading volumes of 0.1 mg/ml pttfpp-ps in 3% w/w ps were chosen due to
the stable and robust signal produced. a working concentration
of the particulate ir(cs)2(acac)-based probe was optimised using
serial dilution measurements, again performed in 20 ll volumes
in glass capillaries at 640 nm. a probe concentration of 12.5 lg/
ml was seen to give moderate and reproducible phosphorescent
signals (4 rfu, fig. 2), and was selected for subsequent measurements. the mitoxpress probe was optimised for the lightcycler
system previously [22] and used at 5 lm.
when measured on the lightcycler, the ir(cs)2(acac)-based
probe appears to be 20–30 times brighter than ptcp-based mitoxpress probe (see fig. 2). however, the former shows signiﬁcant sig-

assay performance was assessed using the robust  xxxg1017xxx  system.
using saturating concentrations of glucose (100 mm) a range of
oxygen proﬁles was generated. increasing enzyme concentration
increases the rate of oxygen consumption, which is seen as an increase in the rate increase in probe signal. the addition of an oil
seal does not signiﬁcantly alter the initial rate of signal change
but does effect the equilibrium intensity by limiting oxygen diffusion back into the system (fig. 4a). such raw intensity proﬁles can
be linearised (fig. 4b, [30]) to circumvent the nonlinear relationship between probe signal and oxygen concentration (fig. 4b),
thereby providing more accurate data reduction resulting in more
precise dose response data (fig. 4c). parallel measurement of up to
32 samples is possible, allowing the simple, reliable, and accurate
determination of enzyme activity.
the mitoxpress probe and pttfpp-based coatings show the
greatest signal change with the former displaying a superior response time and good reproducibility with cv values of about
1%. signal changes for the ir(cs)2(acac) probe are smaller. calculated limits of detection (lod) values for  xxxg1017xxx  activity and mitox-

press and ir(cs)2(acac) probes are 122 and 50 ng/ml, respectively.
with oil-sealed samples, sensitivity increases to 100 and 41 ng/
ml, respectively. mitoxpress displays a larger signal change per
unit enzyme and good linearity (fig. 4c, insets).
oxygenase analysis
the method was then applied to the analysis of a panel of relevant oxygenases, namely mao a, mao b, cox i and ii, cytochrome
p450 1a2 isoforms, and supermix microsomes. fig. 5 shows the
typical data output of such analysis with highly reproducible proﬁles (tight error bars, n = 3). using dopamine and bezylamine as
substrates for mao a and mao b, respectively, reproducible (cv
<1%) time proﬁles were obtained, and control proﬁles showed neg-

ligible change (figs. 5a and b), thereby illustrating that mao catalysed oxygen consumption was readily measurable. using
phenacetin as substrate, large, reproducible signal changes were
also observed for cyp1a2 and supermix-catalysed oxygen consumption; however, in this instance, enzyme in the absence of substrate showed signiﬁcant oxygen consumption (figs. 5c and d).
this effect is due to substrate cycling and is more pronounced for
the supermix preparation than for the single 1a2 isoform. these
data illustrate that cyp1a2-catalysed oxygen consumption is readily measurable either as a single isoform or as part of the supermix
preparation and highlights the degree to which substrate conversion is uncoupled from enzyme activity in such systems.
fig. 6 illustrates the effect of substrate concentration on such
intensity proﬁles, with increasing concentrations of dopamine

causing proportionally larger signal changes, reﬂecting higher
rates of mao a-catalysed oxygen consumption. concentration
dependence at low substrate concentrations shows good linearity
(fig. 6b). similar kinetic data can be generated for other measurable oxygenases (not shown).

for the enzymes under investigation, a panel of relevant substrates was assessed at concentrations at least three times above
the corresponding km. associated activities and error bars are presented in fig. 7a. dopamine,  xxxd314xxx ,  xxxd208xxx , and
phenacetin were chosen as substrates for inhibition assays with

mao a, mao b, cox, and cyp1a2 enzymes, respectively. using
these substrates, the inhibitory effects of speciﬁc compounds can
be assessed. fig. 7b presents the level of inhibition caused by a
ﬁxed inhibitor concentration. this approach would facilitate the
medium throughput identiﬁcation of enzyme inhibitors. dose–response data can also be generated, as shown for the mao a inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx  (fig. 7c). ic50 values generated in this manner for
some drugs and enzymes are presented in table 2. calculated
ic50 values are generally in the same range as literature values with
the exception of the cox 1 inhibitor sc-560. the assay therefore
shows good precision and rather small variability of data (error
bars).

the aim of this work was to develop a robust assay for the activity of oxygen-dependent enzyme systems using quenched-ﬂuorescence oxygen sensing. optimal conditions for monitoring of
activity of mao a, mao b, cox-1 and cox-2, and cyp isoenzymes

coatings.
in agreement with their spectral and o2-sensing characteristics
(fig. 1, table 1) and published data [27,29], all three probes can be
used on the lightcycler. in contrast to mitoxpress and pttfpp-ps

blue led light source (470 nm). the emission peaks are sufﬁciently
broad such that the second detection channel provides adequate
sensitivity for all three probes (fig. 1).the optimum probe concentration was determined (see fig. 2) and concentrations were chosen that provided reproducible, robust and cost-effective
measurement. under measurement conditions, the ir(cs)2(acac)
probe displayed the highest brightness allowing the use of nanomolar working concentrations; however, it showed a signal drift
of 10–12% per hour. this was improved by adding a layer of heavy
 xxxd2648xxx  (fig. 3) allowing the probe to potentially be used in
such a system. all three probes displayed adequate signal changes
on deoxygenation (table 1) and, as expected, this response was
temperature dependent. the mitoxpress probe displayed the
greatest and the ir(cs)2(acac) probes the least temperature dependence. these data would suggest that on other platforms, where
temperature control is not as well regulated, the ir(cs)2(acac)
probe would provide more consistent results. mitoexpress and
pttfpp-ps coatings do, however, display a greater signal change
on deoxygenation.
using the economical and well-characterised glucose/ xxxg1017xxx  system, a range of oxygen consumption rates were generated, thereby
mimicking the conditions used with more biologically interesting
oxygenases. mitoxpress probe gave the largest signal changes
and proﬁles were very reproducible with cv values of 1%
(fig. 4a). ir(cs)2(acac)-derived proﬁles were also reproducible with
cv values of the order around 1% but displayed lower signal
changes. this agrees with their signal changes on deoxygenation
(table 1). the oil seal was seen to have little effect on the initial
rates; however, the point at which equilibrium is reached between
oxygen consumption and back diffusion is higher in the oil-sealed
samples and that condition is maintained for a longer period of
time. pttfpp-ps coatings also display large signal changes but their
low reproducibility (cvs around 20%) and response times are insufﬁcient for such an application. linearised intensity proﬁles (fig. 4b)
allow the analysis of limits of detection (lod) for all three probes.
as the lightcycler interrogates each capillary from the bottom, it
was postulated that pttfpp-ps coatings would provide superior
sensitivity to probes distributed uniformly within the sample.
however, pttfpp-ps measurements were compromised by their
working performance and no such increase in sensitivity was observed, although there is the potential to improve this via fabrication. the lod values for the ir(cs)2(acac) and mitoxpress probes
were in the range from 42 to 122 ng/ml of  xxxg1017xxx  (fig. 4c) with the
latter displaying the largest signal change per enzyme unit. such
linearization procedures address the majority of compound interferences [30], while analogues probe types can also be employed
should problematic compounds libraries be encountered [33].
these data show that, while the pttfpp-ps coatings are not sufﬁciently developed for this application, both ir(cs)2(acac) and
mitoxpress work well. the latter probe showing the greater signal
stability was chosen for further analysis.
to determine its usefulness, the optimised method was applied
to the analysis of biologically interesting mao a and b, cox i and ii,
and cyp isoforms. using sufﬁcient, though economically justiﬁable,
enzyme concentrations, large signal changes and highly reproducible proﬁles were again observed (fig. 5). in the absence of substrate, mao and cox enzymes showed no signiﬁcant signal
change (figs. 5a and b), while cyp isoforms displayed considerable
oxygen consumption uncoupled from substrate turnover (fig. 5c
and d). this effect was more pronounced for the supermix preparation which contains a mixture of cyp isoforms reﬂecting typical
liver expression levels. for some isoforms such as cyp 2c19 speciﬁc substrate (s-mephenytonin)-derived oxygen consumption is
all but indistinguishable from this background consumption (data
not shown). however in instances such as the single 1a2 isoform,
such consumption can be subtracted to generate useful enzyme

activity data. therefore, the method is applicable to the analysis
of these enzymes (fig. 6), and also multiple substrates (fig. 7a).
by choosing the substrate that provides the highest activity, the
method can be tuned to screen for enzyme inhibitors in a medium-throughput manner. using a simple data processing algorithm, the degree of inhibition is easily determined at ﬁxed
concentrations of such putative inhibitors (fig. 7b) and the whole
dose response curve (fig. 7c). ic50 values generated in this manner
were comparable with literature values, considering the different
methodologies and enzyme preparations used in generating the
reference data. signiﬁcant variation with literature exists for certain enzyme–substrate combinations, possibly due the differences
in methodologies used to generate the data or differences in the
source of the enzyme used (table 2). of the ic50 values generated
in this study, sc-560 displays the greatest divergence from the literature. one possible contributory factor to this divergence may be
that in this work cox-1 is extracted from sheep while in the reference data the enzyme is extracted from sf21 insect cells [11]. such
divergences do not, however, detract from the fact that such ic50
values generated using the described method can be used to rank
compounds based on inhibitory capacity.
overall, the developed methodology is shown to be of considerable utility in the investigation of oxygenase activity. the widely
available lightcycler system is well suited for oxygen consumption
measurements since ambient oxygen is effectively excluded from
entering the sample. the method is more sensitive than available
ﬂuorescence-based oxygen consumption assays and provides accurate monitoring of mao and cox and cyp isoenzyme activity with
adequate sensitivity (nm–mm range), facilitating the screening of
new chemical entities for inhibitory activity or as a tool for further
elucidation of a mechanism of action.
