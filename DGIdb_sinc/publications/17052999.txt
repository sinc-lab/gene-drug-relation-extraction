n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa) and genistein
have been associated with lowered cancer risk by reducing inflammatory prostanoids,  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
activity, and altering cell signaling. few studies have
investigated the effect of these compounds in combination
on the molecular control of the cox-2 gene. in a series of
experiments we examined a potential synchronous action
of n-3 pufa and genistein in down-regulating cox-2
expression to diminish  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) production in mda-mb-231 human breast cancer cells. cells
were treated with genistein and various pufa including  xxxd208xxx  (aa),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa),
and docosahexaenoic acid (dha). pge2 concentrations,
expression of cox-2, and cell invasiveness were determined. the n-3 pufa and genistein alone lowered pge2
concentration, and genistein in combination with aa
reversed the high level of this prostanoid in cell cultures
enriched with aa. the degree of cell invasiveness was
reversed by genistein in cell cultures treated with aa and
further reduced in those given dha. the n-3 pufa, in
contrast to aa, reduced cox-2 and nfkb expression.
genistein combined with aa reversed the effects of aa
alone on the expression of cox-2 and nfkb. all three
 xxxd2154xxx  increased the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  in the cells
only when combined with genistein. our results support
the premise that dha and genistein exert complementary
actions whilst genistein is antagonistic to aa for controlling pge2 production as well as invasiveness of mda-mb231 cells in culture by modulating the level of nfkb
expression.

death, while breast cancer is the most common type of this
disease among americans with 1 in 7 women developing
breast cancer (1). in contrast, the incidence and mortality
rates of breast cancer in japanese women are only one-third
of those in americans (2). although the rates of breast cancer
are much lower in japan, they have continually climbed in
the past 30 years as the diet in japan has become more
westernized similar to that in america.
in the past four decades, japanese have increased their
consumption of animal products and calories from fat while
decreased their intake of grains (3). meat consumption has
increased 7-fold and dairy (which includes conjugated
linoleic acids) up to 4-fold in japan. since animal products
are the principle sources of  xxxd208xxx  (aa), the change
in the japanese diet has resulted in an extraordinary rise in
the amount of n-6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa) thus
elevating the ratio of n-6/n-3 pufa. regardless of this
increase, in the year 2000 the estimated dietary ratio of 4:1
for n-6/n-3 pufa in japan is still considerably lower than
the 10:1–15:1 range in the american diet (4). the major
dietary sources of n-3 pufa ( xxxd2318xxx  epa
and docosahexaenoic acid dha) in the japanese diet include
fish, shellfish and seaweed.
in addition to the high n-3 pufa intake, japanese consume
several soy containing food products. individually, n-3 pufa
or soy components have been implicated in epidemiological
(5,6), cell culture and animal studies (7,8) to play a role in
reducing the risk of breast cancer. however, few studies (only
two) have investigated the combined effects of n-3 pufa and
soy genistein on breast cancer (9,10). considering that these
food components, n-3 pufa and soy genistein, are usually
consumed as part of the daily japanese diet, often together in
the same meal, they may provide additive or synergistic
beneficial effects to protect against chronic diseases.
the most prominent mechanism for the chemopreventive
action of n-3 pufa is their suppressive effect on the
production of aa-derived prostanoids, particularly  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2). this prostanoid has been implicated to
play a critical role in immune response to cancer cells,
inflammation, cancer cell proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis (7). the n-3 pufa
compete with n-6 pufa for incorporation into the membrane
phospholipids (11), for the activity of elongases and desaturases involved in the conversion of 18 carbon to 20 and 22
carbon pufa, and for cyclooxygenase (cox) catalytic sites
(12). moreover, some studies proposed that n-3 pufa downregulate cox-2 expression (13) by affecting nuclear
transcription factors, and altering signal transduction and
cell signaling (14). importantly, epa-derived pge3 is much
less efficient compared to pge2 in inducing cox-2
expression (15) and it is a weaker inflammatory agent (16).

materials and methods
cells and reagents
the mda-mb-231 human breast cancer cell line was purchased from
american type culture collection (atcc, manassas, va). iscove’s
modified dulbecco medium (imdm) and fetal bovine serum (fbs) were
obtained from sigma (st louis, mo) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution
from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca).
the following were also purchased: aa, epa and dha (99% purity)
from nu-chek-prep (elysian, mn); fatty acid free-bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa),  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso), formalin solution (4% formaldehyde),
and  xxxd2610xxx  from sigma; genistein (5,7,40 -trihydroxyisoflavone,
>99% pure) from indofine chemical company, inc. (hillsborough, nj);
tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (tpa, 99% purity) from calbiochem (san
diego, ca); and ethanol from aaper alcohol and chemical co.
(shelbyville, ky). all other chemicals, unless noted, were purchased from
sigma.
stat-pge2 assay kits were purchased from cayman chemical (ann
arbor, mi), matrigel and filter inserts from bd biosciences (bedford, ma),
rnaquaeous -4pcr kit from ambion (austin, tx), iscripttm cdna
synthesis kit from bio-rad (hercules, ca), sybr green pcr master mix
from applied biosystems (warrington, uk) and all primers from
sigma-genosys (woodlands, tx).
cell culture
mda-mb-231 cells were routinely maintained in imdm supplemented
with 10% fbs and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 37 c in 5% co2.
cells from passages 5–40 were used for the experiments.
fatty acid enrichment and genistein treatment
treatment media with  xxxd2154xxx  were prepared by addition of  xxxd2154xxx 
dissolved in ethanol (<0.1% ethanol) into imdm at a ratio of bsa to fatty
acids of 2:1 (500 mmol/l bsa) as described previously (25). for treatments
with genistein, the medium was prepared by addition of genistein dissolved
in dmso to the medium immediately prior to use, maintaining a 0.1%
concentration of dmso in the medium. the media for the control cell
cultures contained only vehicle (bsa, dmso or bsa plus dmso).
pge2 assay
mda-mb-231 cells were seeded at 30 000 cells/well in 12-well plates for
3 days until 90% confluent. after 24 h of treatment with fatty acid and/or

810

genistein-supplemented medium, cells were washed with pbs then treated
with imdm containing 10% fbs and 10 nmol/l tpa for 24 h. tpa was
dissolved in dmso (not to exceed 0.1% in the medium). samples of cell
culture media were collected and pge2 concentrations analyzed with a
competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (stat-pge2).
invasion assay
the invasion capacity of mda-mb-231 cells was examined using a modified
boyden chamber matrigel invasion assay (26). cells were grown to 90%
confluency, serum starved for 24 h, followed by 24 h treatment with pufa
and/or genistein. at the end of the treatment period, 2 · 105 cells suspended
in fresh treatment medium were added to the upper compartment of the
boyden chamber and treatment medium containing 10% fbs was added to
the lower chamber. boyden chambers were prepared by coating the upper
surface of track-etched polyethylene terephthalate 8 mm-pore size filter
inserts with 85 mg/cm2 matrigel. after cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 c,
the invaded cells on the lower side of the membrane were fixed with formalin
solution (4% w/v formaldehyde–10% neutral buffered afip formulation) and
stained with 0.2%  xxxd2610xxx . the filters were examined by microscopy
and results were expressed as percentage of invaded cells in the treatment
group compared to those in the control group.
quantitative real-time pcr
cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 90% confluent followed by
treatment with fatty acid and/or genistein-supplemented media for the times
selected. total rna was isolated using an rnaquaeous -4pcr kit. the
yield and quality of the rna were assessed by uv absorbance at 260 and
280 nm, respectively. first strand cdna for cox-2, nfkb,  xxxg1807xxx  and
b-actin were synthesized from 1 mg rna using an iscripttm cdna
synthesis kit. quantitative real-time pcr was performed in 96-well optical
plates using the abi prism 7700 sequence detection system (applied
biosystems, warrington, uk). briefly, 1 ml of the cdna product, 12.5 ml of
sybr green pcr master mix, 9.5 ml nuclease-free water and 1 ml
(25 pmole/ml) each of the forward and reverse primers, were added to each
well to a final volume of 25 ml. all primers were designed using primer
express software v2.0 (applied biosystems). primer sequences for the
genes were as follows: cox-2 forward: gaatcattcaccaggcaaattg, cox-2 reverse: tctgtactgcgggtggaaca, nfkb forward: ggctacaccgaagcaattgaa, nfkb reverse: cagcgagtgggcctgaga,  xxxg1807xxx  forward: ggcttcatgacaagggagtttc,  xxxg1807xxx  reverse:
aaactcaaacttgggctccataaa, b-actin forward: cctggcacccagcacaat, b-actin reverse: gccgatccacacggagtact. the
thermal settings for pcr were 50 c for 2 min, 95 c for 10 min, 95 c for
15 s, and 59 c for 1 min (40·). additional steps at 95 c for 15 s, 59 c for
20 s and 19 min 59 s temperature ramp to reach 95 c and held for 15 s were
performed to construct thermal dissociation curves to confirm the absence of
nonspecific amplification.
statistical analyses
data were analyzed by either a student’s t-test or one-way anova. for
anova analysis, where significant differences were found, a tukey’s
multiple comparison test was performed at a probability of p < 0.05
(sas software, sas institute inc., cary, nc). all data are presented as
means ± sd or as standardized differences calculated from the difference
between values of treatment and control divided by the pooled sem.

results
pge2 biosynthesis
to determine whether pufa act alone or in combination
with genistein to affect pge2 synthesis, mda-mb-231 cells
were treated for 24 h and subsequently treated with tpa
for an additional 24 h. first, the effect of genistein alone
was characterized on pge2 production. genistein dosedependently reduced the amount of pge2 produced by
mda-mb-231 cells compared to the vehicle control
(figure 1 panel a). the suppression observed in cells treated
with genistein was 11% at 1.0 mmol/l and 13% at 2.5 mmol/l
compared with the vehicle control. the effect of dha on
pge2 synthesis was also determined. dha showed dosedependent reduction of pge2 synthesis in mda-mb-231
cells compared with the vehicle control (figure 1 panel b).
the production of pge2 in cells treated with aa was 57-fold

genistein was reported to lower pge2 production in
mesangial cells and macrophages (17,18). genistein may
lower pge2 by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase
signaling cascades (19) that activate the transcription of the
cox-2 gene, or as a potent peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ) ligand increasing peroxisome
proliferator response element (ppre) transcriptional activity
at concentrations of 5 mmol/l (20). genistein has also
been demonstrated to activate ppre transcriptional activity
through  xxxg1805xxx  in heog2 human hepatoma cells (21).
activation of ppre has been associated with the inhibition of
nuclear factor kappa b (nfkb) activity and a consequential
reduction in cox-2 expression (22). in addition, genistein
can act via a  xxxg1807xxx -independent mechanism to inhibit
nfkb activation and the binding of nfkb to dna (23,24).
therefore, genistein can potentially reduce the level of
cox-2 protein and pge2 production by altering nfkb
signaling as demonstrated in macrophages (18).
in the present investigation, n-3 pufa and genistein were
hypothesized to synergistically suppress aa-derived pge2
production and cox-2 expression in mda-mb-231 cancer
cells to decrease cell invasiveness. mda-mb-231 is a highly
invasive cancer cell line that overexpresses cox-2. the
effects of n-6 pufa compared with n-3 pufa alone and in
combination with genistein were studied on pge2 production
and cox-2 expression. levels of nfkb and  xxxg1807xxx , the
nuclear factors involved in the transcription of cox-2 gene,
and the invasive capacity of the cells were also examined.

(n ¼ 3). the data shown is indicative of three separate experiments.

higher compared with the vehicle control (figure 1 panel c).
the addition of genistein to cells enriched with aa reduced
the amount of pge2 by 26% compared to the treatment of
aa alone. both epa and dha treatments [long-chain (lc)
n-3 pufa] with and without genistein resulted in significantly lower amounts of pge2 in cells compared with the aa
treatment. importantly, the treatment of dha with genistein
resulted in a 37% lower concentration of pge2 compared
with the vehicle control (figure 1 panel c, inset).
invasion assay
the matrigel invasion assay was performed to examine
whether the changes in pge2 concentrations resulting from
pufa and genistein treatments correlated with the invasive
phenotype of the mda-mb-231 cells. genistein alone at
10 mmol/l significantly reduced the number of cells invading
the membrane by 40% compared to the vehicle control
(figure 2). at concentrations <10 mmol/l, genistein did not
significantly affect the invasive capacity of mda-mb-231
cells (data not shown). treatment of cells with aa increased

fig. 3. genistein did not affect the expression of cox-2 gene. subconfluent
mda-mb-231 cells were treated with genistein at concentrations 0.1, 1.0 and
2.5 mmol/l in serum-free media for 24 h. the value from vehicle control cells
treated with 0.1% dmso was set at 1 and represented by the dotted line. for
each sample, the ct (threshold concentration) values for the cox-2 gene
were adjusted to the ct for the control gene b-actin (dct ¼ ctcox-2  ctactin).
the dct values were further normalized to the dct of the vehicle control
(ddct ¼ dcttreatment  dctcontrol). the relative quantity of the gene in a
treatment group compared with the control was calculated by 2ddct. bars

invasion by 40% compared with the vehicle control.
however, simultaneous addition of genistein with aa
abolished the effect of aa on cancer cell invasiveness.
thus, genistein treatment with aa attenuated the cancer
promoting effect of this n-6 pufa on breast cancer cells. in
contrast, dha significantly reduced invasion by 27%, and
with the addition of genistein a further decline in the number
of invaded cells was observed (a decrease of 61% compared
with the vehicle control). epa alone did not affect the
invasiveness of the cells when compared to those in the
vehicle control. these findings indicate that genistein blunted
the invasiveness of breast cancer cells subjected to aa and
markedly reduced invasiveness when treated simultaneously
with dha.

e.horia and b.a.watkins

expression of cox-2,  xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb genes
the effect of genistein at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to
2.5 mm on the expression of cox-2 gene in mda-mb-231
cells was determined after 24 h treatment (figure 3).
no significant change in the level of cox-2 mrna was
detected using quantitative real-time pcr method. the
effects of 24 h treatments with pufa at 50 mmol/l (with
and without genistein, 0 and 2.5 mmol/l) on the transcription
rate of cox-2,  xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb were also investigated
using quantitative real-time pcr in mda-mb-231 cells. the
epa and dha treatments including those with genistein led
to reduced cox-2 mrna levels compared to the vehicle
control, but aa did not show a suppressive action on cox-2
transcription unless combined with genistein (figure 4 panel
a). importantly, genistein alone did not affect the level of
cox-2 mrna (as also shown in figure 3) and hence the
suppression observed in the aa plus genistein treatment was
an effect exclusive to the combination of these compounds.
this finding suggests that genistein has a protective effect by
reducing the action of aa on cox-2 at the transcription
level to the same extent achieved by lc n-3 pufa treatments. to further study how pufa and genistein impact the
mechanism involved in the molecular control of the cox-2
gene expression, the effects of these dietary components on
 xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb genes expression were also examined.
genistein treatment alone at the concentration used had no
significant effect on mrna levels for both  xxxg1807xxx  (figure 4
panel b) and nfkb (figure 4 panel c). the combination of
all pufa treatments with genistein resulted in a higher level
of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna, however, epa alone reduced this transcription factor in these cells. both lc n-3 pufa independent
of genistein addition significantly reduced the levels of nfkb
mrna. in contrast, the addition of genistein was necessary
to lower nfkb mrna in cells treated with aa (figure 4
panel c). looking at the expression pattern of cox-2,
 xxxg1807xxx , and nfkb, it can be deduced that suppression in
cox-2 gene transcription concurred with the increase in
812

 xxxg1807xxx  expression and the decrease in nfkb expression.
the changes in mrna levels for  xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb involved
in the molecular control of the cox-2 gene with treatment of
lc n-3 pufa and genistein might suggest a dietary means to
attenuate cox-2 protein amplification associated with the
invasive phenotype of the mda-mb-231 human breast
cancer cells. our study also found that the changes in the
gene expression levels of  xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb did not take
place at the 2 and 8 h treatment durations although the
changes in the expression of cox-2 gene was observed at 8 h
(data not presented). this finding may suggest that physiological concentrations of n-3 pufa and genistein maintained
for long duration are effective to sustain cox-2 gene
suppression through their actions on  xxxg1807xxx  and nfkb.

discussion
the chemopreventive capacity of lc n-3 pufa has been
documented in the past two decades. evidence suggests that
lc n-3 pufa antagonize aa-derived prostanoid formation
through mechanisms involving substrate replacement,
enzyme competition, signal transduction and modulation of
gene expression (7,27). genistein has also been reported to
have chemopreventive actions in cancer cells (28,29), and to
inhibit cox-2 expression and pge2 production (18,30).
the present investigation demonstrated that genistein
reduced the synthesis of pge2 in mda-mb-231 human
breast cancer cells that overexpress the cox-2 gene.
genistein, at a physiological concentration (2.5 mmol/l)
reduced the production of pge2 by 13%. this significant
finding indicates that genistein suppressed pge2 production
at a much lower concentration (which can be achieved by
diet) than previously reported (18). plasma concentrations of
genistein were found to be as high as 6 mmol/l in subjects
receiving dietary intervention (31) while the serum concentration of genistein in japanese male subjects not receiving

were treated with 50 mmol/l pufa and/or 2.5 mmol/l genistein in serum-free media for 24 h. the values from vehicle control cells treated with 25 mmol/l
bsa and 0.1% dmso were set at one and represented by the dotted line. for each sample, the ct (threshold concentration) values for the gene of interest was
adjusted to the ct for the control gene b-actin (dct ¼ ctgene  ctactin). the dct values were further normalized to the dct of the vehicle control (ddct ¼
dcttreatment  dctcontrol). the relative quantity of the gene in a treatment group compared with the control was calculated by 2ddct. bars represent mean values
(n ¼ 2) and are indicative of two experiments. significant difference from control () and from pufa only treatment (†) is calculated by a two-tailed student’s
t-test (p < 0.05).

n-3 pufa, genistein and breast cancer

fig. 5. in the present study, the combination of dha and genistein
antagonized the effect of aa on prostanoid production. genistein and dha
can inhibit the activation of nfkb by  xxxg1807xxx -dependent and -independent
mechanisms (20,23,24,35,40), leading to down-regulation of the cox-2 gene,
pge2 production, and synthesis of nfkb-regulated pro-inflammatory
cytokines (18,22,43). dha and genistein can also suppress the production of
pge2 by altering the flux through the cox-2 enzyme (11,12). additionally,
genistein can potentially interfere with signal transduction involved in the
elevation of camp levels (17,44), hence it prevents the inducing effect of
pge2 on cox-2 gene transcription.

sites for nfkb and only one for ppre which is located much
further upstream from the start site of transcription compared
with the nfkb sites, it seems that suppression of nfkb may
override activation of ppre.
from our investigation, the chemopreventive effect of lc
n-3 pufa and genistein may be 3-fold. first, we observed
that treatment with dha and genistein reduced the synthesis
of pge2, a compound implicated in carcinogenesis and
inflammation. second, epa and dha lowered the expression
of cox-2 and nfkb to decrease the production of pge2.
the lowering effect of epa and dha on nfkb transcription
in the same breast cancer cells was observed in our
laboratory with stearidonic acid (18:4 n-3) enrichment (25).
third, genistein blocked the actions of aa on pge2, cell
invasiveness, and cox-2 and nfkb expression.
simultaneous targeting of cox-2 and  xxxg1807xxx  has been
suggested as a powerful mechanism to lower the risk of
cancer (39). we observed that lc n-3 pufa effectively
down-regulated pge2 production, along with dha being a
potential ligand for  xxxg1998xxx  (40) and genistein as a  xxxg1807xxx 
ligand, they appear to work together to activate the ppre
trans-suppression of pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic
genes (e.g. nfkb). in breast cancer cells, including the
mda-mb-231 cell line used in our study, treatment with
15-d-pgj2 was reported to induce apoptosis (41) and inhibit
proliferation (42). therefore, our study is the first to evoke a
complementary nature of dha and genistein that would
alter or decrease the flux through prostanoid pathways.
intakes of foods containing lc n-3 pufa and genistein
may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk of
breast cancer by down-regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and invasiveness of cancer cells.

any dietary intervention was 0.5 mmol/l (32). therefore, the
2.5 mmol/l genistein used in the present study is relevant to
an achievable dietary level and validates the findings on
prostanoid synthesis in breast cancer cells.
when mda-mb-231 cells were exposed to aa and
genistein, the level of pge2 was reduced compared with
those treated with aa alone. in cells treated with epa, a
prostanoid precursor, the level of pge2 produced was
substantially lower than that in cells treated with aa.
however, nearly a 50% higher pge2 concentration was
observed in epa-treated cells compared to the vehicle
control. since the antibody for pge2 used in this assay had
a 43% cross-reactivity with pge3, the apparent increase in
pge2 concentration observed in epa-treated cells (compared
to the vehicle control) was likely due to an increase in
epa-derived pge3, not pge2. indeed, treatment of a549
human lung cancer cells with 50 mm epa was shown to
boost pge3 synthesis and increase the ratio of pge3–pge2
level 10-fold by the preferential action of cox-2 over
cox-1 enzyme (33). moreover, it has been established that
the mda-mb-231 cells express a low level of cox-1, and
that, prostanoid synthesis in these cells is catalyzed mostly
by the constitutively high level of cox-2 (34). when cells
were treated with dha, a non-pg precursor, we demonstrated that dha dose-dependently reduced the synthesis of
pge2. in a separate experiment to determine the effect of
dha in combination with genistein on pge2 production,
treatment with dha alone tended to lower the pge2
concentration (although not significant), and cells treated
with dha and genistein in combination had the level of
pge2 further lowered. hence, our data provide evidence for
an additive effect of dha plus genistein in suppressing the
endogenous production of pge2 in mda-mb-231 cells.
in our study, treatments with lc n-3 pufa reduced
cox-2 mrna level independent of the addition of genistein.
this is not surprising since both dha and epa were
reported to lower cox-2 expression by blocking the toll-like
receptor-mediated pathway thereby inhibiting nfkb activation (35). treatments with aa, on the other hand, showed
reduction in cox-2 mrna level only when combined
with genistein. we observed that the reduction in cox-2
expression coincided with increased  xxxg1807xxx  expression and
lowered nfkb expression. our observation is consistent with
another study in which cervical cancer cells treated with
 xxxg1807xxx  ligand had upregulated  xxxg1807xxx  expression, suppressed binding activity of nfkb, and reduced expression of
cox-2 gene (36). genistein has been shown to activate
 xxxg1807xxx  (20), and to inactivate nfkb or prevent nfkb
binding to dna (37). we propose that lc n-3 pufa act
complementarily with genistein to increase the transcription
of  xxxg1807xxx  and decrease the transcription of nfkb to suppress
the expression of cox-2. since nfkb has two binding sites
on the cox-2 promoter (37), it is feasible that the addition of
genistein to cells enriched with aa led to inactivation of
nfkb, mediated through higher expression of  xxxg1807xxx  or by
direct effect on nfkb, to reduce the transcription of the
cox-2 gene. when genistein was in combination with epa
or dha, genistein did not enhance the suppression of cox-2
gene expression but worked through another mechanism
(likely to also involve  xxxg1807xxx ) to lower pge2 production and
the invasive phenotype of the cancer cells. it is also
noteworthy that activation of ppre may directly induce the
cox-2 gene promoter (38), however, since there are two

e.horia and b.a.watkins

importantly, this study found that in aa-treated human
cancer cells, genistein effectively lowered pge2 as well as
the expression of cox-2 and nfkb, suggesting a potential
cancer protective effect of soy products in japanese
populations that recently began to consume increasing
amounts of dietary n-6 pufa (aa). figure 5 illustrates
possible targets for the proposed antagonistic effect of
genistein on aa and its complementary actions with dha
on prostanoid synthesis. genistein antagonized the effect of
aa but complemented those of epa and dha on molecular
and biochemical controls for pge2 production. we found
in this study that genistein in combination with epa and
dha affected the expression of cox-2; however, additional
research must confirm changes in the transcriptional activity
of the cox-2 gene by various transcription factors and
the dietary factors used in this investigation.
