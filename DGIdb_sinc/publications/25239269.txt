abstract  xxxd1977xxx  [cerdelgatm (us, eu)], a small-molecule oral glucosylceramide analogue that inhibits the enzyme
 xxxg2376xxx  has been developed by genzyme
corporation (a subsidiary of sanofi) for the treatment of gaucher disease type 1 in adults. inhibition of this enzyme reduces
the accumulation of the lipid glucosylceramide in the liver,
spleen, bone marrow and other organs.  xxxd1977xxx  received its
first global approval in this indication in the us, for use in
treatment-naı̈ve and treatment-experienced adult patients. it is
also under regulatory review in the eu and japan. this article
summarizes the milestones in the development of  xxxd1977xxx 
leading to this first approval for gaucher disease type 1.

1 introduction
gaucher disease type 1 is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder in which the lipid glucosylceramide
accumulates in gaucher cells in organs including the spleen,
liver and bone marrow due to insufficient production of the
enzyme glucosylceramidase [1, 2]. this leads to clinical
manifestations that include enlargement of the spleen and
liver, skeletal complications, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. the current standard of care for gaucher disease type 1 is
enzyme replacement with  xxxd2336xxx  (recombinant human

glucosylceramidase), which can reverse or halt disease
progression but is expensive and requires frequent intravenous infusions for the rest of the patient’s life [1, 3]. moreover, enzyme replacement therapy is associated with a
potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions [1, 4, 5] and,
rarely, the development of antibodies to the enzyme that
reduce its efficacy [6, 7]. oral substrate reduction therapy
with agents such as  xxxd2645xxx  and  xxxd1977xxx  represents an
alternative treatment strategy for gaucher disease type 1.
 xxxd1977xxx  [cerdelgatm (us, eu)] is a small-molecule oral
glucosylceramide analogue developed by with genzyme
corporation (a subsidiary of sanofi) for the long-term
treatment of gaucher disease type 1. it received its first
global approval in the us on 19 august 2014 for the treatment of gaucher disease type 1 in treatment-naı̈ve and
treatment-experienced adult patients [8]. it is the first oral
treatment to be approved for first-line use in patients with
gaucher disease type 1.  xxxd1977xxx  is indicated for use in
patients who are cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2d6 extensive,
intermediate, or poor metabolizers, as identified by a genetic
test approved by the us food and drug administration
(fda) [9]. however, it is contraindicated in patients who are
ultra-rapid cyp2d6 metabolizers and may not achieve
therapeutic concentrations of  xxxd1977xxx , and those whose
cyp2d6 metabolic rate is undetermined and for whom a
specific dosage cannot be recommended.  xxxd1977xxx  is
approved as a hard gelatin capsule containing  xxxd1977xxx 
tartrate 100 mg (equivalent to  xxxd1977xxx  84 mg) for oral
administration [9]. recommended dosages of  xxxd1977xxx  are
84 mg twice daily for intermediate and extensive cyp2d6
metabolizers, and 84 mg once daily for poor metabolizers of
cyp2d6. patients who are receiving enzyme replacement
therapy ( xxxd2336xxx ,  xxxd2336xxx  or taliglucerase
alfa) at the time of initiating  xxxd1977xxx  should start  xxxd1977xxx 
24 h after the last dose of these agents.

the approval of  xxxd1977xxx  was based on two phase iii
trials, engage (nct00891202) and encore
(nct00943111), in treatment-naı̈ve and treatment-experienced patients, respectively, and a phase ii study
(nct00358150). the us fda granted a priority review
designation to genzyme’s application for approval  xxxd1977xxx  in december 2013 [10]. regulatory submissions
seeking approval of  xxxd1977xxx  for gaucher disease type 1
have been submitted in the eu and japan [11–13]. it is also
in phase iii trials in other countries worldwide.
1.1 company information
the efficacy of the progenitor to  xxxd1977xxx  was initially
discovered at the university of michigan during preclinical
studies [11].  xxxd1977xxx  was developed by genzyme corporation, which was acquired by sanofi-aventis (now sanofi) in april 2011 [14].
1.2 patent information
 xxxd1977xxx  has patent protection until 2022 in the us, the
eu and japan [15].

2 scientific summary
2.1 pharmacodynamics
 xxxd1977xxx  is a strong inhibitor of  xxxg2376xxx , with an ic50 of 10 ng/ml [9]. inhibition of this
enzyme reduces the accumulation of glucosylceramide.

2.1.1 effect on qtc interval
although  xxxd1977xxx  was associated with concentrationdependent increases in pr, qrs and qtc intervals in a
single-dose study in 42 healthy volunteers, the effect of a
single supratherapeutic dose on qt/qtc interval was not
considered clinically relevant [9]. the highest geometric
mean concentration of  xxxd1977xxx  in this study was 237 ng/
ml; no clinically relevant qt/qtc prolongation was
observed at this concentration.
in a single-dose study in 99 healthy male volunteers,
modest increases in pr, qrs and qt/qtc intervals were
observed approximately 1–4 h post-dose in some of those
who received  xxxd1978xxx  doses of [10 mg/kg [16].
a plasma drug concentration of approximately 240 ng/ml
was predicted to prolong the qtcf interval by 5 ms,
according to linear mixed effect modelling; this is
approximately 20-fold higher than the predicted therapeutic concentration. no ecg-related adverse events occurred
in this study.
prescribing information for  xxxd1977xxx  includes warnings
and precautions regarding its use in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or long qt syndrome, and

 xxxd1977xxx : first global approval

those taking class ia and iii antiarrhythmic agents, due to
mild ecg changes observed in clinical trials [9].
2.2 pharmacokinetics
 xxxd1977xxx  is metabolized mainly by cyp2d6 and, to a
lesser extent, cyp3a4 [9]. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1977xxx  are dependent on cyp2d6 phenotype. in individuals who are extensive or intermediate metabolizers of
cyp2d6,  xxxd1977xxx  has time-dependent, nonlinear and
greater than dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, while in
those who are poor metabolizers, pharmacokinetics are
expected to be linear and time-independent. systemic
exposure is considerably higher in poorer than in extensive
or intermediate metabolizers [9].
a study in 99 healthy male volunteers showed that a
single dose of  xxxd1978xxx  0.01–30 mg/kg, given as a
liquid, was rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum
plasma concentration (tmax) of approximately 2 h [16].
although exposure was dose-related, it was greater than
dose-proportional. for doses of 0.3–30 mg/kg, the maximum plasma concentration (cmax) ranged from 2.7 to
1,852 ng/ml and area under the concentration-time curve
from time zero to infinity (auc?) ranged from 28.1 to
10,528 ngh/ml; at the lowest doses cmax was not quantifiable and auc was not calculated [14].
 xxxd1977xxx  is moderately protein bound (76–83 %), and
the large volume of distribution following intravenous
administration (835 l) suggests that it is widely distributed
to tissues [9].  xxxd1977xxx  had low oral bioavailability (\5 %
after a single 84 mg dose) in cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers due to extensive first-pass metabolism. elimination
appeared to be monophasic, and the terminal elimination
half-life (t1/2) was 5–6 h. the drug was extensively
metabolized, with \1.5% of a dose recovered unchanged
in the urine. although multiple oxidative metabolites are
produced, none of these has shown pharmacological
activity. excretion of  xxxd1977xxx  after oral administration is
predominantly faecal (51.4 %) and urinary (41.8 %), and is
mainly in the form of metabolites [9].
in a study in 36 healthy volunteers who received  xxxd1978xxx  50, 200 or 350 mg twice daily as oral
capsules, steady-state drug concentrations were achieved
after approximately 60 h and were greater than expected,
based on single-dose administration on day 1 [16]. at
steady state, auc over the dosing interval (aucsss) for the
200 mg dose was 2.0- to 2.4-fold higher than auc? and
was 17-fold greater than the auc0–sss of the 50 mg dose.
plasma concentrations of  xxxd1977xxx  were generally higher
in women versus men. accumulation of the drug in those
who were cyp2d6 poorer metabolizers was 300, 400 and

1831

2,300 % for the 50, 200 and 350 mg dose levels, respectively. on day 12, t1/2 ranged from 4.32 to 7.28 h [14].
in cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers receiving multiple
doses of  xxxd1977xxx  84 mg twice daily, a mean cmax of
12.1–25.0 ng/ml was reached in a median tmax of 1.5–2 h
[9]. auc0–s ranged from 76.3–143 ngh/ml and auc0–12ss
was twofold higher than auc?. mean t1/2 was approximately 6.5 h.
in cyp2d6 poorer metabolizers,  xxxd1977xxx  had a median
tmax of 3 h and mean cmax and auc0–s values of
113–137 ng/ml and 922–1,057 ngh/ml, respectively,
after multiple doses of 84 mg twice daily [9]. systemic
exposure was seven- to ninefold higher than in extensive
metabolizers. mean t1/2 was approximately 8.9 h. although
once daily dosing of  xxxd1977xxx  84 mg has not been studied
in poorer metabolizers, predicted cmax and auc0–24 values
are 75 ng/ml and 956 ngh/ml, respectively [9].
pharmacokinetic data from a phase ii study of  xxxd1977xxx 
in 26 patients with gaucher disease type 1 who received
 xxxd1978xxx  50 mg twice daily showed marked interpatient variability [17]. the mean trough concentration was
7.1 ng/ml (range 1.9–18.5 ng/ml) and the mean cmax was
21.6 ng/ml (range 7.7–36.9 ng/ml). the mean tmax and
t1/2 were 2.3 and 6.8 h, respectively. the mean auc0–s
was 152.7 ngh/ml and the mean volume of distribution
(vz/f) was 8,650 l. strong correlations were observed
between steady-state mean trough concentrations and
absolute reductions in spleen volume and plasma  xxxg444xxx  activity [r = -0.79l; p \ 0.001 (n = 22) and
r = -0.46; p = 0.04 (n = 20), respectively].
2.2.1 effect of food
food did not significantly affect the rate of absorption of a
single dose of  xxxd1977xxx  in a phase i study in 24 healthy
male volunteers, although a 15 % decrease in cmax was
observed when it was taken after a high-fat meal [16].
mean auc? values in the fed and fasted states were 696
and 623 ngh/ml, respectively [geometric mean ratio
(gmr) 104.4 %; 90 % confidence interval (ci)
89.0–122.5]. the mean cmax values in the fed and fasting
states were 79.1 and 88.3 ng/ml, respectively (gmr
85.2 %; 90 % ci 67.9–106.9).
2.2.2 effect of renal and hepatic impairment
 xxxd1977xxx  is not recommended for use in patients with
moderate to severe renal impairment and those with hepatic
impairment due to a lack of data in these populations [9].
however, no dose adjustment is required for patients with
mild renal impairment.

1832

2.2.3 drug–drug interactions
 xxxd1977xxx  is a substrate of cyp2d6 and  xxxg590xxx ; therefore,
concomitant use of medicines that are inhibitors of either
enzyme (e.g. the cyp2d6 inhibitors paroxetine and  xxxd3314xxx  and the  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors ketoconazole, fluconazole
and ranitidine) could significantly increase exposure to
 xxxd1977xxx , causing prolongation of pr, qtc and/or qrs
intervals and hence cardiac arrhythmias [9].  xxxd1977xxx  may
also interact with grapefruit juice.
concomitant use of  xxxd1977xxx  with  xxxg590xxx  inducers
such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, st. john’s
wort and phenytoin decreases  xxxd1977xxx  exposure [9].
 xxxd1977xxx  inhibits p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and cyp2d6;
concomitant administration of  xxxd1977xxx  could increase the
concentrations of drugs that are substrates of p-gp (e.g.
digoxin, phenytoin, colchicine and dabigatran etexilate) or
cyp2d6 (e.g. metoprolol, tricyclic antidepressants and
phenothiazines) [9].
the interaction between  xxxd1977xxx  and digoxin was
evaluated in a two-period study [18]. healthy volunteers
(n = 28) received a single oral dose of digoxin 0.25 mg on
day 1 in the first period. in the second period, they received
 xxxd1977xxx  150 mg twice daily (100 mg twice daily for poor
metabolizers of cyp2d6, n = 4) on days 11 and 17, and a
single dose of digoxin 0.25 mg on day 15. the gmr for
digoxin exposure in period 2 versus period 1 was 149 %
(90 % ci 133–166). the cmax of digoxin was also
increased with co-administration of  xxxd1977xxx , with a gmr
of 170 % (90 % ci 156–184) for period 2 versus period 1.
2.3 therapeutic trials
results from two multinational phase iii trials of  xxxd1977xxx 
in adult patients with gaucher disease type 1 have been
reported, engage (nct00891202) in treatment-naı̈ve
patients and encore (nct00943111) in treatmentexperienced patients. in addition, long-term results from a
multinational phase ii study (nct00358150) have been
published.
2.3.1 phase iii trials
treatment with  xxxd1977xxx  produced significant improvements in primary and secondary endpoints compared with
placebo in the randomized, double-blind engage study
[9, 19]. this trial enrolled 40 patients aged c16 years with
pre-existing splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia and/or
anaemia who were stratified by baseline spleen volume and
randomized to receive  xxxd1977xxx  (42 mg twice daily initially, increasing to 84 mg twice daily from week 4
depending on plasma trough concentrations at week 2) or

r. m. poole

placebo for 9 months. although patients in this study were
allowed to have received substrate reduction therapy or
enzyme replacement therapy [6 months and [9 months
prior to randomization, respectively, 35 patients had
received no prior treatment. most patients had severe bone
marrow burden (bmb) at baseline (80 and 75 % of patients
in the  xxxd1977xxx  and placebo groups, respectively) [20].
patients with symptomatic bone disease were excluded
from the trial.
after 9 months, a significant greater reduction in the
primary endpoint, the percent change in spleen volume
from baseline in multiples of normal, was seen with  xxxd1977xxx  versus placebo (-27.8 vs 2.3 %; p \ 0.0001) [9,
19]. significant differences were also seen for the secondary endpoints of absolute change in haemoglobin level
(0.69 vs -0.54 g/dl, p = 0.0006), percentage change in
liver volume in multiples of normal (-5.20 vs 1.44 %;
p = 0.0072) and percentage change in platelet count (32.0
vs -9.06 %; p \ 0.0001). bmb scores were significantly
improved with  xxxd1977xxx  versus placebo, with reductions in
the total, spine and femur scores (-1.1 vs 0.0; p = 0.002,
-0.6 vs 0.1; p = 0.002 and -0.5 vs 0.0; p = 0.026,
respectively) [19, 20]. the difference in total spine bone
mineral density, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) z-scores, was not statistically significant,
with a least squares (ls) mean treatment difference of 0.2
(p = 0.06). disease burden, according to the gaucher
disease severity scoring system (ds3), was significantly
improved with  xxxd1977xxx  versus placebo (ls mean treatment difference of -0.3; p = 0.0452) [19].
 xxxd1977xxx  showed non-inferiority to enzyme-replacement therapy with  xxxd2336xxx  in the randomized, openlabel encore study [21]. this study enrolled and treated
159 patients who had received enzyme replacement therapy for c3 years and had met prespecified therapeutic
goals at baseline (no bone crisis, no symptomatic bone
disease within the previous year, mean platelet
count c100,000/mm3, spleen volume \10 times normal,
liver volume \1.5 times normal, and mean haemoglobin
levels of c11 g/dl for females and c12 g/dl for males).
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive  xxxd1977xxx  (starting
dose 42 mg twice daily, increasing to 84 and 127 mg twice
daily at weeks 4 and 8, respectively, according to plasma
trough concentrations at weeks 2 and 6) or  xxxd2336xxx  for
12 months [9]. the majority of patients (75 %) had previously received  xxxd2336xxx , while 21 % had been treated
with velaglucerase.
 xxxd1977xxx  demonstrated non-inferiority to  xxxd2336xxx 
for the composite primary endpoint of stability in spleen
volume (\25 % increase), liver volume (\20 % increase),
haemoglobin level (\1.5 g/dl decrease) and platelet count
(\25 % decrease) from baseline to 12 months in per-

 xxxd1977xxx : first global approval

protocol analyses (99  xxxd1977xxx  and 47  xxxd2336xxx 
recipients) [9]. stability in all four parameters was maintained for 84.8 % of  xxxd1977xxx  recipients, compared with
93.6 % of  xxxd2336xxx  recipients [the lower bound of
the 95 % ci for the difference (-17.6 %) was less than
-25 %, the prespecified margin for non-inferiority]. stability
in spleen volume (95.8 vs 100 %), liver volume (96.0 vs
93.6 %), haemoglobin level (94.9 vs 100 %) and platelet
count (92.9 vs 100 %) was observed in most patients in
either treatment group, and there were no clinically
meaningful between-group. therapeutic goals for gaucher
disease type 1 were maintained in 12 of 15  xxxd1977xxx 
recipients and all three  xxxd2336xxx  recipients who had not
achieve stabilization for individual components [9]. at
baseline, most patients had normal bone mineral density
(bmd) scores; these remained within the normal range
during treatment with  xxxd1977xxx  [21].
2.3.2 phase ii trial
 xxxd1977xxx  produced significant improvements in spleen and
liver volumes, haemoglobin level and platelet count in a
single-arm, open-label, multinational phase ii study in
adult patients with gaucher disease type 1 (nct00358150)
[17]. a total of 26 patients who had splenomegaly with
thrombocytopenia and/or anaemia at baseline received
 xxxd1978xxx  50 or 100 mg twice daily based on their
plasma concentrations of the drug. the primary endpoint,
improvement in two of three disease parameters (spleen
volume, platelet count and haemoglobin level) at
52 weeks, was achieved in 20 of 26 (77 %) patients in the
intention-to-treat (itt) population and 91 % of the 22
patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment. among the
six patients in the itt population who did not achieve the
primary endpoint at week 52, four had discontinued treatment before week 52 and the two who had completed
52 weeks of treatment had improvements in spleen volume
but decreases in platelet volume.
at week 52, significant improvements were observed in
mean spleen volume (-38.5 %; p \ 0.001), liver volume
(-17.0 %; p \ 0.001), haemoglobin level (?1.62 g/dl;
p \ 0.001) and platelet count (?40.3 %; p \ 0.001) [17].
bmd improved at the lumbar spine, with increases in z-score
and t-score of 0.31 and 0.33, respectively (both p = 0.01 vs
baseline); however, no significant changes in femoral t-score
or z-score were observed. there were no bone crises or
clinically significant changes in mobility, bone pain, or x-ray
assessments. mri assessments showed that gaucher cell
infiltration of bone marrow in the femur improved in 35 % of
patients and was unchanged in 65 %. in patients with elevated
biomarkers at baseline, levels of  xxxg444xxx , angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace),  xxxg45xxx 

1833

(trap) and chemokine  xxxg356xxx  decreased by 35–50 % from
baseline. normalization of plasma glucosylceramide and
ganglioside gm3 levels was also observed. health-related
quality of life showed significant improvements in median
short form (sf)-36 scores for physical functioning, general
health and the physical component summary score (p \ 0.01
vs baseline for all), but not in other sf-36 domains.
twenty patients entered an extension phase of this study
at week 52 [17, 22, 23]. two-year follow-up data showed
continued improvements in haematological, visceral and
skeletal endpoints, with 85 % of patients meeting therapeutic goals for three or more of the following parameters:
spleen volume, liver volume, haemoglobin level and
platelet count [22]. mean reductions from baseline in
spleen and liver volume were 52 and 24 %, (both
p \ 0.001). mean increases in haemoglobin level were
2.1 g/dl for the overall population, and 3.1 g/dl for ten
patients with anaemia at baseline (p \ 0.001). platelet
count increased by a mean of 50,000/mm3 (p \ 0.001).
therapeutic goals for liver volume, spleen volume, haemoglobin level and platelet count were met in 95, 90, 95
and 60 % of patients, respectively. a significant 7.8 %
increase from baseline in lumbar spine bmd was observed
(p = 0.01) and the corresponding t-score and z-score
increased by 0.6 (p = 0.012) and 0.6 (p = 0.003),
respectively. reduced or stable levels of bone marrow
infiltration by gaucher cells were also observed.
after 3 years of treatment, median plasma levels of
glucosylceramide and gm3 were significantly reduced (80
and 64 %, respectively; p \ 0.0001 vs baseline for both) to
normal levels [24]. median levels of  xxxg444xxx ,  xxxg356xxx  and ace also decreased significantly (by 80, 73 and
62 %, respectively; all p \ 0.0001 vs baseline), although
these remained above normal levels. trap levels also
remained above normal, although a 51 % reduction from
baseline was observed at 3 years (p \ 0.0020).
among patients followed for 4 years (n = 19), spleen
and liver volume decreased from baseline by 63 and 28 %
and haemoglobin levels and platelet counts increased by
2.3 g/dl and 95 %. at the 3- and 4-year follow-up, similar
proportions of patients met therapeutic goals for three or
more of these parameters, and individual therapeutic goals
[haemoglobin level (100 vs. 100 %), spleen volume (100
vs. 100 %) liver volume (89 vs. 94 %) and platelet count
goal (63 vs 50 %)] [25, 26].
improvements from baseline in lumbar spine bmd and
biomarker levels were also observed at 3- and 4-years’
follow-up [25, 26]. at 4 years, lumbar spine bmd
increased by a mean 9.9 % (p = 0.02) from baseline [27]
and the mean lumbar spine t-score increased from –1.6 at
baseline to -0.9 (p = 0.01), which was within the normal
range. the mean z-score increased from -1.17 at baseline

1834

r. m. poole

to -0.48; increases in femoral t-score and z-score from
baseline were also observed (from -0.04 to 0.13 and from
0.27 to 0.48, respectively). mri showed decreased infiltration by gaucher cells in 10 of 18 evaluable patients
(56 %), while the other eight patients (44 %) remained
stable. a transient worsening was observed in one patient
who had previously shown an improvement; this resolved
and continued improvement was observed 1 year later. no
fractures of the lumbar spine or femur and no bone crises
were reported, and patients with focal bone lesions at
baseline (42 %), remained stable. of the seven patients
with bone infarctions at baseline, one had an improvement
by the second year of treatment and the others remained
stable. one new asymptomatic and indeterminate bone
lesion was detected after 4 years; however, this subsequently resolved. no patients reported restricted mobility
and none had new bone crises or clinically significant
changes in bone pain.
2.3.3 analysis of phase ii and iii data
a post-hoc comparison of data from engage and the
phase ii study and data from a matched group of  xxxd2336xxx -treated patients from the international collaborative gaucher group gaucher registry indicated that
 xxxd1977xxx  had similar effects to  xxxd2336xxx  on visceral
(reductions in spleen volume) and haematological
(increases in median haemoglobin levels and mean
platelet counts) parameters at 9, 12 and 48 months [28].
 xxxd1977xxx  had a greater effect on skeletal manifestations
than  xxxd2336xxx . in patients treated with  xxxd1977xxx  in
engage, lumbar spine z-scores increased from baseline by a mean of 0.29 at 12 months (compared with
0.11 for  xxxd2336xxx ), 0.55 at 24 months and 0.69 at
48 months. the rate of increase in lumbar z-score with
 xxxd1977xxx  was greater than that seen with  xxxd2336xxx 
(0.06–0.13 per year) in 342 registry patients with a
similar baseline bmd to that of patients in the phase ii
 xxxd1977xxx  study.

2.4 adverse events
the most common adverse events in patients taking  xxxd1977xxx  in clinical trials were fatigue, headache, nausea,
diarrhoea, back pain, pain in the extremities and upper
abdominal pain, all of which occurred in c10 % of
patients in the  xxxd1977xxx  arm of the engage trial
and c10 % of patients in the  xxxd1977xxx  arm and more
frequently than in the  xxxd2336xxx  arm of the encore
study [9]. other adverse events in encore included
dizziness, asthenia, cough, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, constipation, palpitations and rash. longterm safety results from a phase ii trial in 26 patients were
similar to those of the engage and encore trials [9].
an analysis of pooled data from the three phase iii trials
and one phase ii trial of  xxxd1977xxx  in a patients with gaucher
disease type 1 indicated that it was well tolerated [29]. in
these studies, a total of 393 patients were treated with  xxxd1977xxx  for a mean duration of 1.4 years. most adverse events
occurred within the first 6 months of treatment and only
19 % of adverse events were considered to be related to the
study drug. the most common adverse events, occurring
in c10 % of patients, were headache (17 %), arthralgia
(14 %), nasopharyngitis (13 %), upper respiratory tract
infection (11 %), diarrhoea (10 %) and dizziness (10 %). a
total of 42 serious adverse events occurred in 35 patients;
three of these events were considered possibly treatmentrelated, two (occurring in the same patient) probably treatment-related, and one definitely related to  xxxd1977xxx . only
3 % of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.
2.5 ongoing clinical trials
enrolment of a total of approximately 370 patients in more
than 30 countries in three phase iii trials of  xxxd1977xxx  in
gaucher disease type 1 has been completed, and follow-up
is ongoing. these trials are:
•

were clinically stable on their existing twice-daily
 xxxd1977xxx  regimen [12, 32].

the primary analyses for encore and engage are
complete; both trials are currently in an open-label extension phase. in addition, follow-up for the phase ii trial of
 xxxd1977xxx  in 26 patients is ongoing (nct00358150) [33].

3 current status
 xxxd1977xxx  received its first global approval on 19 august
2014 for the treatment of gaucher disease type 1 in treatment-naı̈ve and treatment-experienced adult patients in the
usa.
