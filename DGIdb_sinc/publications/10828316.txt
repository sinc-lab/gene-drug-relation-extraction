abstract: natural ( xxxd3417xxx , ra) and synthetic retinoids exhibit
potent anti-proliferative, normalization of differentiation and anti-inflammatory
activities which appear to account for their therapeutic effects in acne, psoriasis,
photoaging, precancerous lesions and established cancers. although ra has shown
considerable promise in dermatologic indications, certain side effects have restricted
its use as a choice of agent for chronic administration. systematic synthesis of
receptor-selective retinoids has resulted in two topical drugs,  xxxd3297xxx / xxxd3297xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx ) and  xxxd77xxx 
( xxxd77xxx ).  xxxd3297xxx  is indicated for psoriasis and acne and  xxxd77xxx  gel for the treatment of acne. these
drugs bind to the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) family members. various rar subtype-specific and
function-selective retinoids have been synthesized. these retinoids, which are in various stages of preclinical development for the treatment of cancers, psoriasis and as an antidote to accutane-mediated
mucocutaneous toxicity, will also be discussed in this review. discovery of another retinoid receptor,
retinoid x receptor (rxr), revealed that rxr-specific retinoids already existed in retinoid chemical
libraries. structure activity relationship studies based upon binding and transactivation assays led to the
synthesis of rxr-specific ligands with high affinities for rxr subtypes. these compounds were found
to be effective in the treatment of hyperglycemia in animal models of type ii diabetes. the discovery of
novel retinoids along with an increased understanding of the biological functions and mechanisms of
action of retinoid receptors are likely to result in improved treatments for existing responsive indications
and identification of new retinoid therapeutic targets.

introduction
retinoids are small, lipid-soluble molecules with
pleiotropic effects on cell growth, differentiation,
homeostasis,
apoptosis
and
embryonic
development. a plethora of epidemiological studies
have demonstrated an inverse correlation between
cancer development and the dietary consumption of
 xxxd3105xxx  or beta-carotene [for reviews and references,
see ref. 1]. the use of retinoids in dermatology and
oncology was initiated with first generation
compounds with the successful use of tretinoin
( xxxd3417xxx , ra), isotretinoin (13- xxxd2404xxx ) and
 xxxd2071xxx  (a synthetic ra analog) in the treatment of
acne, psoriasis, photoaging and squamous cell
carcinoma (scc) (1). however, acute and chronic
toxic side effects associated with these retinoids
have necessitated the development of novel retinoids
to meet the medical needs of patients. these side
effects
include
skeletal
abnormalities,
mucocutaneous toxicity, hypertriglyceridemia and
teratogenesis.

development of drug resistance has been observed
with tretinoin in the treatment of acute

needs of the psoriasis and acne patients have
resulted in the development of two receptor-selective

treatment of psoriasis and acne and  xxxd77xxx  gel is

which have potential in the treatment of psoriasis,

synthetic retinoids result in inhibition of tumor cell
proliferation, resolution of preneoplastic and
malignant lesions, and improvement of psoriasis,
photoaging and acne [for reviews and references,
see 1,4,5]. retinoids exert these effects by
regulating the expression of target genes in a cell
and tissue-context dependent manner. at the
molecular level, retinoids exert their effects through
two families of nuclear receptors, namely retinoic

acid receptors (rars) and retinoid x receptors
(rxrs). rars and rxrs are ligand-dependent
transcription factors that belong to the superfamily
of steroid/thyroid/ xxxd1682xxx  nuclear receptors
[1,4,5]. retinoid receptors regulate gene
expression in two different ways: (a) they either
induce the expression of responsive genes by
binding to the ra-responsive elements (rares)
present in the upstream regions of these genes or

retinoid research

(b) they inhibit the expression of genes by
downregulating the action of other transcription
factors such as  xxxg1222xxx  and nf- xxxg1181xxx  [6-11]. the rar
proteins can be functionally divided into 6 different
modules, a-f (fig. (1)). the a/b-region encodes
for the ligand-independent activation function, af1 [12]. the c-region contains the dna-binding
domain (dbd) consisting of two c2-c2 type zinc
fingers. the d-region is the linker between the
dbd and the ligand binding domain (lbd). the eregion contains the lbd, the ligand-dependent
activation function, af-2 [12], and the
hydrophobic zipper dimerization function [13]. the
functions of the d- and the f-regions are poorly
understood. the rxr proteins have the functional
modules from a through e (fig. (1)) but they lack
the f-region present in other nuclear receptors.
three distinct subtypes of rars (alpha, beta and gamma) and
rxrs (alpha, beta, and gamma) are encoded by separate genes.
these subtypes are further expressed as various
isoforms that differ in a-regions and are generated
by alternative splicing [1,4,5,9]. gene knock outs
with individual rar subtypes and double knockouts have clearly demonstrated the requirement of at
least one rar isoform for normal mouse
embryogenesis and for normal function in the adult
mouse [9]. the remarkably high degree of
conservation between mouse and human rar and
rxr subtypes, their distinct spatio-temporal
patterns of expression [9], and the cell, response
element and promoter-context dependence of their
activation functions suggest that each rar and
rxr may perform unique functions [12]. a
characteristic example of the differential expression

current pharmaceutical design, 2000, vol. 6, no. 9

921

of retinoid receptors is observed in skin-based
systems. the epidermis and cultured keratinocytes
express mainly rargamma (90 % of the total rar
repertoire), very little raralpha and insignificant
amounts of rarbeta [14]. therefore, the therapeutic
exploitation of rargamma function is a reasonable
strategy for the treatment of dermatological
indications.
rars and rxrs induce the expression of
responsive genes by binding to their promoter
regions as rar-rxr heterodimers [12] or rxr
homodimers [15]. the  xxxd3417xxx  response
elements (rares) that recognize rar-rxr
heterodimers consist of a direct repeat (dr) of the
sequence 5’-pugg/ttca-3’ separated by 2 (dr2)
or 5 ( xxxg1057xxx ) base pairs [1,4,5], where “pu” stands
for a purine residue. the rxr response element is
a dr1. retinoids also inhibit the expression of a
number of genes and this activity of retinoids may
in part account for their anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions. some of these genes contain
 xxxg1222xxx  or nf- xxxg1181xxx  response elements, as their major
enhancer factor binding sites and retinoids inhibit
the expression of these genes by antagonizing the
action of these transcription factors [6-8,10,11].
retinoid ligands
all-trans ra, the endogenous ligand for the
rars, binds with kd values of 5-10 nm to raralpha,
beta and gamma and it does not show any appreciable
binding to the rxrs. on the other hand, the

putative endogenous ligand for the rxrs, 9-cisra, binds with approximately equal affinity to the
rars and rxrs. various rar- and rxr-specific
synthetic retinoids have been synthesized and
described in the literature [fig. (2)]. for example,
 xxxd1058xxx  is an rar-specific synthetic retinoid that
binds only to rars and not to rxrs [5].
recently, potent rxr-specific synthetic retinoids
have been described which bind to all three rxrs
with high affinity but do not show any appreciable
binding to any of the rar subtypes [16-19].
similarly, rar-subtype-selective retinoids have
been synthesized by systematic modification of the
basic ra structure. for example, the acetylenic
retinoid, agn 190299, and the stilbene derivative,
 xxxd77xxx  ( xxxd77xxx ) are rarbeta/gamma-selectiveretinoids
[6,20]. more recently, raralpha -specific retinoids
(agn 193835 and agn 193836) have been
described which bind only to raralpha but not
significantly to other rars [21]. all the above
mentioned retinoids are agonists because they
induce the expression of retinoid-responsive genes.
apart from these, two other classes of retinoids,
namely, antagonists and inverse agonists have also
been synthesized. antagonists, by their ability to
compete with the agonists for binding to the ligandbinding pocket of the receptor, inhibit the agonistdependent activation of responsive genes. inverse
agonists, apart form acting as classical antagonists,
have biology of their own and they also decrease the
basal level expression of the retinoid responsive

nagpal and chandraratna

genes. agn 193109 is an antagonist at all three
rars but functions as an  xxxd1422xxx  at rargamma
[22]. a potent raralpha -specific antagonist (agn
194301) has also been designed by combining the
structural features, which provided functional
antagonism with those that gave raralpha -specific
binding [23]. in the case of rxrs, subtypeselective ligands have not yet been synthesized.
however, rxr-specific antagonists have been
made [24,25].
is rxr an orphan receptor?
9- xxxd2404xxx  has been proposed as the hormone for
rxrs based upon its high affinity binding to rxr
and its ability to induce gene expression through
endogenous and transfected dr1-based promoters.
however, these observations do not demonstrate
that 9- xxxd2404xxx  is the endogenous, physiological
ligand of rxrs. the conclusion that ra is the
hormone for the rar was based not solely upon
the binding and transactivation assays involving ra
and rars, but also on the presence of
physiological concentrations of ra in the serum
and cellular systems. the concentrations of ra in
these systems correlated with the amount of ra
required for the alteration of expression of retinoidresponsive genes. ra, although it did not bind to
rxrs, induced transcription through rxr at
higher concentrations. this led to the proposal that

fig. (2). retinoid receptor ligands. rar and rxr ligands synthesized to date have been presented. these synthetic
compounds were made by systematic synthesis of ra analogs based on structure activity relationship studies. the molecular
cues to their synthesis were rar and rxr ligand binding and transactivation assays.

retinoid research

a metabolite of ra might be activating rxr in
transactivation assays [26]. subsequently, it was
demonstrated that ra treatment of cultured cells
resulted in the formation of 9- xxxd2404xxx  and that 9-cisra activated rxrs [27,28]. however, the
question as to whether 9- xxxd2404xxx  is a
pharmacological or physiological ligand for rxrs
remains unanswered. for a molecule to be
classified as a physiological ligand, its cellular
concentration should be within the range of its
transactivation and binding potencies at its cognate
receptor. the unequivocal demonstration of the
presence of endogenous 9- xxxd2404xxx  at the cellular or
tissue level has not been reported so far. 9- xxxd2404xxx 
was not detected in rat and bovine sera [29].
although a chromatographic absorbance peak
corresponding to standard 9cis-ra was detected in
extracts from mouse liver and kidney, the material
in this peak was neither spectroscopically
characterized nor tested in either rxr

assays
[28].
subsequently, it has been suggested that phytanic
acid (a plant terpenoid) is the physiological ligand
for the rxr-signaling pathway [29].
induction of gene expression by
retinoids
retinoid receptors induce transcription by
binding to response elements (rares and rxres)
present in the upstream regions of ra-responsive
genes. the rare is occupied by and positively
responds to rar-rxr heterodimers upon
stimulation by rar ligands. although there are
conflicting reports as to whether rxr ligand bind
to rar-rxr heterodimers [30], they have clearly
been shown to enhance the action of rar ligands
in cellular assays [31,32]. whether rxr-rxr
homodimers exist in non-transfected cells is still an

fig. (3). rar responsive genes. rar specific retinoids bind to the rar moiety of rxr-rar heterodimer and either
positively regulate the expression of some genes by binding to the promoter elements of the responsive genes or negatively
regulate the expression of other genes by antagonizing the enhancer action of transcription factors, such as  xxxg1222xxx , nf- xxxg1181xxx  and

open question because a number of studies are
unable to demonstrate the presence of rxr
homodimers or the effects of rxr ligands in cells
which express functional rxr protein in quantities
more than that of rars [12,14,33-35]. therefore,
rxr-specific ligands in most cases may not be
functioning through rxr-rxr homodimers but
through rxr-ppar (peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor) or alternative rxr heterodimers.
the list of ra-responsive genes is rapidly growing
with the application of genomics techniques to the
study of differential gene expression by retinoids.
most of the retinoid responsive genes contain dr-2
or  xxxg1057xxx  motifs as rares with some exceptions
which contain non-canonical rares. raresponsive genes which contain rares in their
promoter regions are shown in fig. 3. genes with
rxres in their promoter elements are shown in
fig. 4. the dr motifs are spaced by one base in
rxres, whereas they are generally spaced by five
or two bases in the case of rares. thus, rxres
will also respond to ppar-rxr heterodimer where,
ppar can be  xxxg1805xxx  , pparbeta/delta or  xxxg1807xxx  .
although a number of rares and rxres are
identified by transfection and in vitro gel retardation
studies, their retinoid responsiveness in vivo
remains to be confirmed.

nagpal and chandraratna

rationale for receptor-selective
retinoids
the presence of multiple rar and rxr
subtypes (as well as several isoforms for each
subtype), the distinct spatio-temporal distribution of
rars and rxrs and the requirement of ligand
dependent co-activators (such as cbp, p300,  xxxg1510xxx   xxxg2198xxx , sug1, tif1/2 etc.) and co-repressors (such as ncor and smrt) in receptor function contribute to
the complexity and pleiotropy of retinoid action. in
fact, a combination of all these factors which result
in the diverse biological activities of retinoids
provides an opportunity to therapeutically exploit
the beneficial effects of retinoids in the treatment of
a range of diseases.
to obtain retinoids with reduced side effect
profiles, medicinal chemistry efforts have been
employed to obtain receptor subtype-and/or
function-selective retinoids. ideally a receptor
subtype specific retinoid would activate its subtype
in the target tissue but not other receptor subtypes
in non-target tissues. therefore, the use of a
subtype-specific retinoid would limit the retinoid
toxicity by avoiding gene expression changes in
non-target tissues. these subtype-specific retinoids
may exhibit beneficial effects only in few
indications but most importantly, they will also be
restricted in their side effect profiles.

 xxxd3297xxx  is the first topical retinoid developed
for the treatment of psoriasis. it is also topically
effective in the treatment of acne. in a phase ii
clinical trial involving patients with plaque
psoriasis, once or twice daily topical application of
 xxxd3297xxx  produced excellent results over the 8week treatment period. in addition, sustained
therapeutic benefit was observed up to 8-weeks
post-treatment [36]. in a pivotal, multicentre,
randomized clinical study with once daily
application of  xxxd3297xxx  gel (0.1 % or 0.05 %) or
placebo, 324 patients with plaque type psoriasis
were treated topically for 12 weeks and then
followed up for another 12 weeks with no
treatment. successful plaque clearance rates of 60
%-70 % were obtained with  xxxd3297xxx  gel. these
success rates were significantly better than those
observed for the placebo group [37]. clinical
response to 0.1 % gel was more rapid than to 0.05
%  xxxd3297xxx  gel, whereas, maintenance of diseasefree status after cessation of therapy appeared

somewhat better for 0.05 % gel than for 0.1 %
 xxxd3297xxx  gel [37]. therefore, the effective use of
 xxxd3297xxx  may involve initial application of 0.1 %
gel for rapid resolution of lesions followed by 0.05
% gel for maintenance therapy.
 xxxd3297xxx  mechanism of action
 xxxd3297xxx  binds to all three rars but activates
gene expression effectively only through rarbeta and
rargamma [4,8]. however, it inhibits  xxxg1222xxx - and nf-il6dependent gene expression through all three rars
[6,7]. the antagonism of  xxxg1222xxx - and nf- xxxg1181xxx 
dependent gene expression is probably important
for the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative
activities of  xxxd3297xxx . topical  xxxd3297xxx  resulted
in the inhibition of inflammation-associated proteins
hla-dr, icam-1 and  xxxg2006xxx  in psoriatic lesions
[33,36]. topical  xxxd3297xxx  also inhibited the
expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers
 xxxg744xxx  i,  xxxg1217xxx ,  xxxg2188xxx ,  xxxg2006xxx  and  xxxg1743xxx , all
of which are overexpressed in psoriatic lesions
[4,33,36]. further the level and pattern of
expression of filaggrin was normalized by
 xxxd3297xxx  [36].  xxxd3297xxx  also down-regulates the
interferon-gamma (ifn- gamma ) induced expression of  xxxg2006xxx 
and  xxxg744xxx  i in cultured keratinocytes [33]. since
ifn- gamma is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis, the
selective inhibition of certain ifn- gamma mediated gene

expression pathways might contribute to the
therapeutic action of  xxxd3297xxx . a list of genes
whose expression is inhibited by  xxxd3297xxx , is
presented in fig. 5.
 xxxd3297xxx  also induced the expression of three
novel genes,  xxxd3297xxx -induced gene 1 ( xxxg940xxx   xxxg1934xxx ),
tig2 and tig3 in various skin systems including
psoriatic lesions.  xxxg940xxx   xxxg1934xxx  and tig2 appear to be
putative cell adhesion molecules [34,35] and tig3
is a novel class ii tumor suppressor or antiproliferative gene [38]. a list of the genes
positively regulated by  xxxd3297xxx  in various skin
systems and the known or putative functions of
their products is shown in fig. 5. tig3 was
identified as a novel retinoid-inducible antiproliferative /class ii tumor suppressor gene
because (a) it showed homology to a known rat and
human class ii tumor suppressor h-revl07 [39,40],
(b) it was induced by  xxxd3297xxx  in psoriatic lesions
in vivo where  xxxd3297xxx  exerts its anti-proliferative
activity, (c) the retinoid-dependent regulation of
tig3 was observed in retinoid-sensitive but not in
resistant breast cancer cell lines, (d) tig3
expression was not observed in a number of cancer
cell lines and primary tumors, whereas it was
expressed in the corresponding normal tissues and
(e) overexpression of tig3 in cells inhibited their
proliferation and ability to form colonies [38]. the

delineates the molecular mechanisms of  xxxd3297xxx 
action in psoriasis and these genes may serve as
molecular targets for the identification of more
potent retinoids or other new chemical entities for
the treatment of psoriasis.  xxxd3297xxx  also induced
the expression of a known tumor suppressor gene,
p21, and a putative anti-inflammatory gene psg in
psoriatic lesions and cultured keratinocytes (d.
disepio, a. kasravi, rasc and sn, unpublished
observations). currently,  xxxd3297xxx  is being
developed for the oral treatment of cancer. the
regulation of expression of genes involved in
proliferation by  xxxd3297xxx  and the action of
 xxxd3297xxx  on the proliferation of various cancer cell
lines provided impetus for the therapeutic
exploitation of the anti-proliferative activities of this
retinoid.
 xxxd77xxx  ( xxxd77xxx ;  xxxd77xxx )
 xxxd77xxx  is a topical, synthetic retinoid
approved for the treatment of acne. in clinical trials
using once daily  xxxd77xxx  (0.03 % or 0.1 %)
application, more than 50 % reduction in the total
number of acne lesions was observed in 70-90 % of
patients in the  xxxd77xxx  group. although  xxxd77xxx 
and tretinoin gels were equally efficacious,
 xxxd77xxx 
showed
statistically
significant
superiority over tretinoin in terms of its side effect
profile [41].
 xxxd77xxx  mechanism of action
 xxxd77xxx  is an rar beta/gamma -selective retinoid in
binding assays, whereas it is an activator of gene
expression through all three rars. further, unlike
tretinoin (ra), it does not bind to crabp ii.
 xxxd77xxx  was more potent than ra in inducing
plasminogen activator protein in f9 cells and in
inhibition of  xxxg744xxx  i protein in cultured
keratinocytes [20].  xxxd77xxx  inhibited the
proliferation of hela cells in culture and odc
activity in hairless rat skin, which are indicative of
its anti-proliferative activity [20]. the anticomedolytic activity of  xxxd77xxx  was demonstrated
by its ability to resolve epidermal utriculi in rhino
mouse. the anti-inflammatory properties of
 xxxd77xxx  were demonstrated by its ability to inhibit
(a)
chemotactic
responses
of
human
polymorphonuclear (pmn) leukocytes, (b) the
activities of 5-and 15-lipoxygenases, (c) the
oxidative burst of rabbit pmns, (d) arachidonic
acid-induced ear edema in mouse and (e) uvinduced erythema in guinea pig [20].

future generation retinoids
raralpha -specific retinoids
two raralpha -specific agonists, agn 193835 and
agn 193836, have been synthesized which bind
with 600-fold and 2000-fold greater affinity to
raralpha than to rarbeta and do not show any
appreciable binding to rar gamma [21]. raralpha -specific
agonists are as potent as rar pan-agonists in
inhibition of proliferation of breast cancer cells in
vitro [42 and our unpublished observations]. they
did not irritate hairless mice skin even when used at
a dose of 10,000 times higher than an irritating dose
of an rar pan-agonist [43]. skin irritation is a
classical toxicity associated with rar pan-agonists,
like ra or  xxxd1058xxx , and is believed to be a
manifestation of rargamma activation. it should be
noted that rargamma is the predominant rar subtype
present in the skin and it constitutes more than 90
% of the total skin (epidermal) or keratinocyte rar
repertoire [14]. therefore, raralpha specificity is
inversely correlated with skin irritation side effects
of retinoids. since only 10 % of the total rar
repertoire of the skin is raralpha , it remains to be seen
whether the occupancy of raralpha is enough to
achieve the therapeutic effects in skin indications
such as psoriasis, acne, photoageing, squamous cell
carcinoma, kaposi’s sarcoma and mycosis
fungoides (mf). pre-clinical as well as clinical
studies are required to obtain proof of concept
regarding the activity of this class of receptorspecific retinoids in skin diseases. mf is a
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma which responds to oral
isotretinoin, eretinate and arotinoids [44-46]. the
presence of raralpha as the major rar subtype in tcells suggests that oral or topical raralpha -specific
retinoids may exhibit a better therapeutic index for
the treatment of mf than rar pan-agonists. we
are currently developing an raralpha -specific retinoid
for the treatment of cancer, particularly for breast
cancer and leukemia. the rationale is that (a) raralpha
is the major rar subtype present in breast cancer
and leukemia cells, (b) raralpha -specific retinoids
inhibit the proliferation of these cells and (c)  xxxg1931xxx 
is the major effector of retinoid action in breast
cancer cells [42 and sn, c. ghosn, m. sutter and
rasc, unpublished observations).
acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl) is a rare
type of acute myeloid leukemia, which is
characterized by a diagnostic chromosomal
translocation, t(15;17) (q22;q11-22) involving
raralpha gene on chromosome 17 and promyelocytic
leukemia (pml) gene on chromosome 15. ra has
been shown to induce complete remission in apl
patients and it is the first successful demonstration

of differentiation therapy [for review and references,
see 47]. disease remission results from rainduced differentiation of immature abnormal
promyelocytes to fully differentiated granulocytes.
the retinoid-associated side effects of the therapy
are mucosal dryness, headache and bone pain. since
raralpha is the major subtype expressed in myeloid
cells, raralpha -specific retinoids are expected to be
effective in apl differentiation therapy and may
exhibit a better therapeutic index than ra.
rarbeta-specific retinoids
rarbeta-specific retinoids, which induce gene
expression only through rarbeta and not through
raralpha and gamma , have been synthesized [48]. these
compounds will be useful in elucidating the biology
associated with rarbeta and the identification of
rarbeta-agonist responsive indications. since rarbeta
expression is below detection limits in skin, rarbetaspecific transactivators with anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity
additionally through raralpha and gamma could potentially
be useful for the treatment of hyperproliferative and
inflammatory diseases of skin and may be nonirritating. further, the expression of rarbeta in the
eye and the brain indicates that rarbeta-specific
ligands may be of importance in diseases of these
organs.
rargamma -specific retinoids
although truly rargamma -specific retinoids are yet
to be developed, compounds with selectivity for
rargamma have been synthesized [49,50]. the presence
of rargamma as the major rar subtype in skin [14]
indicates that this subtype would account for most
of the therapeutic and possibly also the toxic side
effects of retinoids in skin diseases. rargamma -specific
compounds may exhibit increased therapeutic
efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis and skin
neoplasias and are expected to not cause
hypertriglyceridemia.
rar
nists

antagonists/inverse

ago-

a ligand, agn 193109, which binds with high
affinity to all three rars but does not induce gene
expression through the rars has been synthesized
[23]. it functions as a potent antagonist of rar
agonist activity in various in vitro and in vivo
models [22,23,51]. the most commonly associated
toxicities associated with the use of oral retinoids
are
mucocutaneous
toxicity
and
hypertriglyceridemia. these toxicities were not

927

displayed by the antagonist/ xxxd1422xxx . further,
topical application of agn 193109 completely
abolished the mucocutaneous toxicity produced by
a systemic 13- xxxd2404xxx  in an animal model [51].
based upon these results a topical rar antagonist
is under development for prevention or treatment of
the mucocutaneous toxicity associated with the use
of oral accutane in acne patients.
rar antagonists which, apart from acting as
classical antagonists, also inhibited the basal level
expression of ra-responsive genes were
subsequently classified as rar inverse agonists
[22]. rar inverse agonists appear to inhibit gene
expression by their ability to release co-activators
and sequester co-repressor n-cor onto rars
[e.klein and rasc, unpublished observations].
rar inverse agonists have intrinsic biological
activities which are independent of their ability to act
as rar antagonists. in normal human
keratinocytes, agn 193109, like an rar agonist,
inhibited the expression of  xxxg1437xxx  and the
psoriatic differentiation marker  xxxg2006xxx  [22,52].
interestingly, unlike an  xxxd1422xxx , a neutral
antagonist, agn 193840, did not inhibit  xxxg2006xxx 
expression but it antagonized both rar-agonist
and  xxxd1422xxx -mediated inhibition of  xxxg2006xxx 
expression [52]. in contrast to an rar agonist,
agn 193109 did not inhibit  xxxg744xxx  i and keratin 6
(k6), two other markers of keratinocyte
differentiation [52]. although rar agonist and
 xxxd1422xxx  both inhibit  xxxg2006xxx  expression,
 xxxg2006xxx  inhibition is abrogated by co-treatment of
cultured keratinocytes with an rar agonist and
 xxxd1422xxx . this mutual antagonism was
observed both at rna and protein levels suggesting
that the agonist and  xxxd1422xxx  regulate  xxxg2006xxx 
by distinct mechanisms [52]. since rar inverse
agonists mimic some of the negative gene
regulatory activities of an rar agonist, inverse
agonists may be therapeutically effective in the
treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory
indications. a topical antagonist/ xxxd1422xxx  is
currently under development at allergan for the
topical treatment of psoriasis.
paradoxically, an  xxxd1422xxx  induced the
expression of  xxxg2006xxx  expression in ece16-1
cervical carcinoma cells, whereas an rar agonist
inhibited its expression in these cells. thus, there
appears to be cell context dependent regulation of
genes by the  xxxd1422xxx  [52]. the availability of
the inverse agonists of rars provide an
opportunity to identify other biological activities
associated with their use in various systems and this
knowledge may in turn lead to therapeutic
indications responsive to this class of retinoids.

anti- xxxg1222xxx  retinoids
an activated transcription factor complex  xxxg1222xxx 
has been implicated as a transducer of signals
leading
to
hyperproliferation,
abnormal
differentiation and inflammation. retinoids are
therapeutically effective in the treatment of
inflammatory and hyperproliferative diseases like
psoriasis, acne, photoageing and certain
precancerous and malignant lesions. some skin
hyperproliferative or psoriatic differentiationassociated genes whose expression is controlled by
 xxxg1222xxx  are k6,  xxxg744xxx  i,  xxxg2188xxx  and odc [for reviews
and references, see 5,6]. proinflammatory genes
whose expression is controlled by  xxxg1222xxx  enhancer
motifs include collagenase,  xxxg1437xxx  and
gelatinase [5,6]. since retinoids inhibit ap1dependent gene expression, this may be one of the
mechanisms for the therapeutic action of retinoids
on photodamaged skin, psoriasis, acne and
cancers. the  xxxg1222xxx  antagonism domain of rar is a
complex of the core of the dna binding domain
and the hydrophobic zipper region.  xxxg1222xxx 
antagonism is engendered by both monomeric
rars and rxr-rar heterodimers [53]. although
the therapeutic value of rar-mediated antagonism
of  xxxg1222xxx -dependent gene expression is increasingly
being appreciated, the mechanism underlying the
rar-anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity is largely unknown. the
sequestration of a common factor(s) by the receptor
has been proposed as a plausible mechanism of
rar- xxxg1222xxx  antagonism because (a) rars do not
directly interact with c-jun/c-fos, (b) rars and  xxxg1222xxx /c-fos mutually antagonize each other’s action,
(c) rar- xxxg1222xxx  antagonism is cell-context dependent
and (d) rars do not bind in vitro to an  xxxg1222xxx  motif
[53].  xxxg516xxx  (cbp) has recently
been shown as a cofactor for creb, c-jun, c-fos,
rar, rxr, tr, gr and er and required for
creb-,  xxxg1222xxx -, rar-, rxr- and gr-mediated
transactivation. therefore, sequestration of cbp
has been proposed to account for the inhibition of
 xxxg1222xxx -dependent gene expression by nuclear
receptors. however, a number of observations
indicated that cbp may not be the principle
common integrator between rar and  xxxg1222xxx  signal
transduction pathways. these observations are: (a)
cbp interacts with the lbd of rar, whereas lbd
alone does not confer rar-mediated anti- xxxg1222xxx 
activity, (b) cbp also interacts with the lbd of
er, which actually enhances  xxxg1222xxx  activity, (c) if
cbp is absolutely necessary for transactivation and
anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity of rars, then the separation of
these two activities by retinoids will not be
possible. however, the pharmacological separation
of these two activities by synthetic retinoids has
been reported [6,11], (d) cbp/p300 may not be

nagpal and chandraratna

present in limited concentrations because
transfection of hela cells with these expression
vectors did not result in induction of an  xxxg1222xxx 
reporter activity, (e) cbp is also a cofactor for e1a,
but e1a does not inhibit rar-mediated gene
expression, (f) non-phosphorylatable mutants of  xxxg1222xxx  and v-jun, which do not bind to cbp, still
inhibit gr-mediated transactivation [53]. these
observations thus indicated that cbp might not be
the sole mediator of the anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity of rars
and other nuclear receptors.
the cross talk between retinoid and  xxxg1222xxx 
signaling pathways can be exploited for the
development of synthetic retinoids for the treatment
of various inflammatory and hyperproliferative
diseases. in order to improve therapeutic indices of
future retinoids, attempts are being made to
synthesize transcriptionally inert retinoids with
potent anti- xxxg1222xxx  properties. recent reports have
indicated the possibility of pharmacological
separation of transactivation and  xxxg1222xxx -antagonism
functions of rars [6,11].
rxr-specific retinoids
after the discovery of 9- xxxd2404xxx  as a ligand for
rxrs [27,28], a series of retinoids that selectively
bound to rxrs but not to rars in binding assays
were discovered. in transactivation assays, these
ligands activated rxr-rxr homodimers but not
the rxr-rar heterodimers. the ppar responsive
element (ppre) is identical to a rxre. the dr1
motif has been reported to be activated by both
rxr-ppar
heterodimers
and
rxr-rxr
homodimers [24,25]. the use of thiazolidinediones
(tzds) as therapeutic agents for the treatment of
type ii diabetes and the discovery that tzds are
ligands for the nuclear receptor  xxxg1807xxx  [54],
prompted in vitro and in vivo studies comparing the
effects of  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr ligands. these studies
demonstrated that an rxr ligand could activate
gene expression through an rxr-ppar
heterodimer in transient transfection assays as well
as induce the expression of acyl-coa oxidase
(aco) and bifunctional enzyme in vivo [24,25,55].
based upon these findings, rxr ligands were
tested in mouse models of type ii diabetes where
they successfully decreased hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia [56]. a more pronounced
beneficial effect was observed in these models with
a combination of an rxr and a  xxxg1807xxx  ligand than
with either compound alone [56].
rxr-specific ligands have also been reported to
activate a transcriptional response through rxr-

retinoid research

 xxxg1805xxx  heterodimers [55]. fibrates, for example
gemfibrozil, are rxr- xxxg1805xxx  heterodimer
activators and are used in the clinic for the treatment
of hyperlipidaemia. an rxr ligand and gemfibrozil
showed synergism in the activation of pprecontaining genes, aco and bifunctional enzyme
[55]. therefore, rxr ligands, in principle, could
share some of the therapeutic effects of fibrates if
the beneficial response occurs through the rxrpparalpha heterodimer. an rxr-specific ligand
reduced hypertriglyceridaemia in db/db mice and
the combination of an rxr-specific ligand and
gemfibrozil had significantly greater efficacy in
lowering triglycerides [55].
rxr-specific compounds have also been tried in
various pre-clinical models of cancer. in clonogenic
assays in soft agar, rxr-specific ligands inhibited
the proliferation of both androgen-dependent and
androgen-independent prostate cancer cells [57]. an
rxr-specific ligand also showed synergism with
 xxxd1682xxx  in inhibiting the growth of lncap
prostate cancer cells [58]. further, in a
chemoprevention study, 9- xxxd2404xxx  inhibited prostate
carcinogenesis in vivo in a model of n-methyl-nnitrosourea induced rat prostate carcinogenesis
[59]. these observations, taken together indicate the
potential of rxr-specific ligands either alone or in
combination with other therapeutic regimens in the
treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. since, a
 xxxg1807xxx  -specific ligand inhibited the proliferation of
smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo [60], and
rxr may function as rxr-ppar heterodimers, we
studied the effect of rxr-specific compounds on
growth factor induced proliferation of human and
rat aortic smooth muscle cells. rxr-specific
ligands inhibited the proliferation of these cells with
an ic50 (amount of the ligand required for 50 %
inhibition of cell growth) value of 1-10 µm [sn, m.
sutter and rasc, unpublished observations).
further, rxr-specific ligands synergized with a
 xxxg1807xxx  ligand in the inhibition of proliferation of
aortic smooth muscle cells. these results indicate
that rxr-specific ligands may be of therapeutic
value for the treatment of restenosis.
conclusions
antiproliferative,
anti-inflammatory
and
normalization of differentiation activities associated
with natural and synthetic retinoids indicate that
these small molecules are of potential use in the
treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative
diseases. the first generation of retinoids, (namely,

current pharmaceutical design, 2000, vol. 6, no. 9

929

tretinoin, isotretinoin and  xxxd2071xxx ) has been used
for many years for the treatment of acne, psoriasis
and disorders of keratinization.  xxxd3297xxx 
( xxxd3297xxx / xxxd3297xxx ) and  xxxd77xxx  ( xxxd77xxx ) are a
second generation of retinoids that are topical
agents for the treatment of psoriasis and acne,
respectively. in order to increase the therapeutic
efficacy and reduce the side effects associated with
retinoids and to identify novel indications of
retinoid action, a number of groups are currently
synthesizing future generations of receptor- or
function-selective retinoids.
rargamma -selective/
specific retinoids may exhibit an increased
therapeutic index for skin indications since rargamma is
the predominant rar subtype in skin. in light of
the absence of skin irritation with the use of raralpha specific retinoids and the presence of raralpha as the
major isotype in t-cells, raralpha specific compounds
appear to have strong potential for the treatment of
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and possibly psoriasis.
alternatively, the third generationfunction-selective
retinoids, inverse agonists and retinoids with only
 xxxg1222xxx  inhibitory may show improved therapeutic
indices for the treatment of psoriasis, photoaging,
acne and neoplasias. an  xxxd1422xxx  is currently
under development for the treatment of psoriasis
and accutane-induced mucocutaneous toxicity.
 xxxd3297xxx  and an raralpha -specific ligand are under
development for the treatment of cancers. since
combination therapy with various drugs and
regimens is an accepted common practice in the
treatment of cancers, retinoids are being developed
in combination with other cytotoxic regimens for
the treatment of breast cancer and leukemia. similar
combination approaches are also being tried for the
treatment and management of psoriasis. since
retinoids, corticosteroids,  xxxd1682xxx  analogs and
immunosuppressive agents affect psoriasis by
different mechanisms, appropriate combinations of
some of these agents may exhibit a synergistic
therapeutic effect and reduced toxicities that are
associated with the individual therapies.
the discovery of rxr-specific ligands, the
rxr-ppar signaling pathway and the
identification of thiazolidinediones as  xxxg1807xxx 
ligands, resulted in the demonstration of rxrspecific ligands as potent agents for the treatment of
hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in mice
models of type ii diabetes. this class of
compounds has also shown considerable potential
in the treatment of restenosis and prostate cancer.
the identification of receptor subtype-selective
compounds along with the elucidation of their
molecular mechanism of action is likely to identify
novel targets of retinoid action.
