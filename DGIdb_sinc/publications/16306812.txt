abstract: the antianginal agent  xxxd2884xxx  inhibits rat cardiac
carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1) and cpt-2, key enzymes for
mitochondrial transport of  xxxd2154xxx . we tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2884xxx , in therapeutic concentrations (2 mm), inhibits palmitate oxidation and enhances glucose oxidation in isolated rat
cardiomyocytes and in the working rat heart, thereby increasing efficiency of oxygen utilization. in isolated cardiomyocytes,  xxxd2884xxx  (2 mm) exerted no acute effects on palmitate oxidation, but after
48 hours pre-exposure oxidation was inhibited by  xxxd2884xxx  (2 to
10 mm) by 15% to 35% (p , 0.0002). in non-ischemic working rat
hearts (3%bsa, 0.4 mm palmitate, 11 mm glucose, 100 mu/ml
insulin)  xxxd2884xxx  (2 mm) had no significant acute effect on cardiac
efficiency, palmitate or glucose oxidation, but 24 hours pretreatment
with transdermal  xxxd2884xxx  increased cardiac work (by 29%, p ,
0.05) and cardiac efficiency (by 30%, p , 0.02) without significant
effects on palmitate oxidation. the selective cpt-1 inhibitor oxfenicine
(2 mm) inhibited palmitate oxidation and enhanced glucose oxidation, but failed to enhance cardiac efficiency. in conclusion, in the
non-ischemic working rat heart,  xxxd2884xxx  increases myocardial
efficiency by a mechanism(s) that is largely or entirely independent of
its effects on cpt. effects on cardiac efficiency during ischemia, and
with changes in fatty acid oxidation after longer  xxxd2884xxx  pretreatment remain to be determined.

t

he oxygen-sparing effect of a shift in metabolic substrate
utilization from fatty acid to carbohydrate has been
proposed to underlie the beneficial effect during ischemia of
inhibitors of myocardial fatty acid oxidation.1,2  xxxd2884xxx  is
a prophylactic antianginal agent without significant hemodynamic effects in patients.3 we have shown previously in isolated rat cardiac mitochondria, that  xxxd2884xxx  is an inhibitor
of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1), a key

enzyme in the transport of  xxxd2154xxx  into
mitochondria.4 we subsequently demonstrated5 in isolated
rat hearts, perfused in the langendorff mode with palmitate in
addition to glucose, that a therapeutic concentration of  xxxd2884xxx  (2 mm) protected in vitro against diastolic contracture
during low-flow ischemia, but did not reduce the concentration
of long chain acylcarnitines (lcac), products of cpt-1.
the failure of cardiac lcac concentration to decrease in
 xxxd2884xxx -treated hearts was compatible with the finding that
 xxxd2884xxx  is a relatively non-selective cpt inhibitor, inhibiting cpt-2 with similar potency to its inhibition of cpt-1.
although simultaneous inhibition of cpt-1 and cpt-2 would
be expected to inhibit long-chain fatty acid oxidation, and
thereby lead to increased efficiency of myocardial oxygen utilization, we did not assess fatty acid oxidation directly in that
study.5 to date, few studies have examined the effects of
 xxxd2884xxx  on myocardial fatty acid oxidation either in intact
cardiomyocytes or in the intact heart. whereas jeffrey et al6
reported in a working rat heart preparation that  xxxd2884xxx 
administered acutely in vitro inhibited fatty acid oxidation,
our previous studies in humans7 suggest that some biologic
effects of  xxxd2884xxx , including those on platelets, exhibit a
considerably delayed onset, being best demonstrated after
prolonged treatment. moreover, delayed onset of  xxxd2884xxx 
effects is not restricted to in vivo studies because similar delays
in onset of metabolic effects of  xxxd2884xxx  have been reported
in isolated hepatocytes.8
the current study was designed to test the hypotheses
that: (1)  xxxd2884xxx  in therapeutic concentrations inhibits
long-chain fatty acid oxidation, both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in working rat hearts and that (2) these effects of
 xxxd2884xxx  exhibit slow onset. simultaneously, the potential
ability of  xxxd2884xxx  to increase cardiac efficiency of oxygen
utilization in working rat hearts was compared with that of
oxfenicine, a specific inhibitor of cpt-1.

cut open and rinsed with hanks  xxxd2988xxx 
(hbss). small pieces approximately 1 mm 3 1 mm were
digested at 4Â°c overnight with gentle shaking in sterile hbss
containing  xxxg1852xxx  mg/ml, followed by digestion in collagenase 0.2 mg/ml at 37Â°c for 15 minutes with shaking.
following centrifugation and washing, the pellet was resuspended in dmem with 10% fcs and penicillin/streptomycin
and pre-plated into flasks for 1 hour to allow adherence of
fibroblasts. the suspended cells were plated in 6-well plates
(falcon) or t25 flasks at 0.75 3 106 cells per well and 2.22 3
106 cells per flask. after 3 days in culture at 37Â°c with 95%
relative humidity, they were washed and replaced with serumfree dmem containing 1% bsa and  xxxd2884xxx  (as the
maleate salt) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). cells were exposed to
 xxxd2884xxx , or vehicle, for 48 hours, and then medium was
replaced with serum-free dmem containing 1% bsa, 5 mm
glucose, 100 mu/ml insulin, and 1.2 mm palmitate, and
incubated at 37Â°c to determine substrate oxidation. palmitate
was prebound to albumin as described by lopaschuck and
barr.9 in some cultures the effect on palmitate oxidation of
a shorter preincubation time of 1 hour with  xxxd2884xxx  was
compared with that of 48 hours preincubation. after preincubation the cells were incubated for 8 hours with 9,10-3h
palmitate at 37Â°c, and then the medium from each well was
collected and used to estimate the amount of palmitate
oxidized.
glucose oxidation was estimated after 48 hours preincubation only. rate of glucose oxidation was estimated from
14
co2 produced by cells incubated with u-14c glucose in t-25
flasks. cells were incubated for 8 hours at 37Â°c with
palmitate- and glucose-containing medium as described above
for palmitate oxidation. 14c glucose containing medium was
introduced to the flasks for the last 4 hours of incubation only,
to prevent saturation of the 14co2 capture solution. 14co2
evolved during incubation was captured with 2m sodium
hydroxide solution attached to each flask via a flow through
system (5% co2 in air) to enable gas capture.
at the end of incubation with radiolabeled substrates,
the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (pbs)
and then pbs containing edta 2 mm added. after scraping
from the wells or flasks, the cellular dna content was estimated fluorometrically as described by labarca and paigen.10
metabolic data were normalized to dna content.

working rat heart
albino wistar rats, 400 g body weight, were anaesthetized with halothane. hearts were removed rapidly and
placed in ice-cold calcium-free krebs bicarbonate buffer. the
hearts were cannulated via the aorta onto the perfusion
apparatus and perfused initially in the langendorff-mode with
krebs bicarbonate buffer (in mm: nacl 118, kcl 4.7, kh2po4
1.18, nahco3 25, mgcl2 1.05, cacl2 2.5). the left atrium and
the pulmonary artery were then cannulated and the heart
switched to working mode with a preload on the left atrium of
11 mm hg and an afterload on the aortic outflow of 80 mm hg.
the oxygen concentration of perfusate entering the heart, and
that exiting the heart in the pulmonary artery outflow, was
estimated via a flow-through clarke type oxygen electrode
(rank bros). flow rate in the aortic outflow and on the inflow

850

to the atrium was monitored using electromagnetic flow probes
(zepeda instruments). aortic pressure was monitored using a
pressure transducer (omeda). physiological data were recorded continuously using an 8-channel maclab (ad instruments) connected to a powermac computer. cardiac work was
estimated from mean aortic pressure and cardiac output,
converted as per grossman11 to g.mh2o/min/g dry weight
(ie, cw = map (mm hg) 3 co (ml/min) 3 0.0136/g dry
weight). efficiency (g.m/mmol) was estimated from the ratio of
cardiac work (in g.m/min/g dry weight) to oxygen consumption (in mmol/min/g dry weight). perfusate consisted of krebs
bicarbonate containing 3% bsa, 0.4 mm  xxxd2833xxx  (prebound to albumin), 11 mm glucose, and 100 mu/ml of insulin
oxygenated with 95%o2/5%co2 maintained at 37Â°c and was
recycled. 9,10-3h palmitate or u- 14c-glucose was added to
the perfusate to estimate rates of oxidation of palmitate and
glucose respectively. hearts were perfused for 60 minutes in normal flow conditions, with sampling of perfusate  xxxd1891xxx -minute
intervals to estimate substrate metabolism.  xxxd2884xxx  2 mm,
oxfenicine 2 mm, or vehicle were added at the start of perfusion in the working mode. at the end of perfusion hearts
were frozen in an aluminium clamp cooled with liquid nitrogen, and stored at â€“80Â°c until further analysis. the hearts were
pulverized under liquid nitrogen and aliquots used for subsequent analysis, one aliquot being used to estimate dry weights
of tissue. data were then expressed relative to dry weight
of tissue.

pretreatment of rats
a subset of albino wistar rats were pretreated for
24 hours with  xxxd2884xxx  gluconate (200 mg) applied in a
paste with sorbolene cream to the dorsal skin after removing
the hair with cold wax strips under light anesthetic with
halothane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen.  xxxd2884xxx  gluconate
was used because of its greater solubility than the maleate salt.
transdermal dosing was used after preliminary studies
indicated that gavage with  xxxd2884xxx  resulted in gastric
irritation to the rats. preliminary studies indicated that 200 mg
applied in a paste delivered sufficient  xxxd2884xxx  to achieve
a plasma level of 2 mm (plasma concentration;  xxxd2884xxx ,
2.02 6 0.29 mm; hydroxy- xxxd2884xxx  0.86 6 0.21 mm, n =
8). control rats were treated in an equivalent manner with the
vehicle. the paste was covered by a protective layer of
tegaderm. following pretreatment of the animals, the hearts
were set up in the isolated working heart preparation as
described above.  xxxd2884xxx  was present in the perfusate for
 xxxd2884xxx  pretreatment group at 2 mm to prevent any washout of the drug from these hearts during in vitro assessment.

measurement of substrate oxidation
palmitate oxidation
palmitate oxidation was estimated from the rate of formation of 3h2o from 9,10-3h palmitate. 3h2o was separated
from 3h palmitate in the heart perfusate or the cell culture
medium by solvent extraction essentially as described by
lopaschuk and barr.9 palmitate oxidation was linear over the
incubation period and less than 5% of the substrate was removed during the incubation.

evolved co2 was captured continuously via a gas
outflow tube from the perfusion apparatus, which was otherwise closed. this was sampled  xxxd1891xxx -minute intervals; 1 ml
aliquots of the perfusate were removed  xxxd1891xxx -minute intervals
and injected under  xxxd2648xxx  to prevent loss of co2. perfusate
samples were processed as below to evolve and capture the
dissolved co2.

cardiomyocytes
at the end of incubation dissolved 14co2 in the medium
was estimated by incubating the media with 9m  xxxd3258xxx 
for 1 hour at room temperature, and capturing the evolved
14
co2 with 2m sodium hydroxide essentially as described
previously by lopaschuk and barr.9 glucose oxidation was
linear over the incubation period and less than 5% of the
substrate was removed from the incubation medium.

biochemical assays
atp
an aliquot of powdered tissue was extracted in
perchloric acid (0.6 m). the resulting extract was neutralized
and assayed for atp by the spectrophotometric method of
bergmeyer.12

glycogen
a second aliquot of tissue powder was extracted by
hydrolysis with 30% koh, precipitation with ethanol, and
enzymatic digestion with amyloglucosidase to form glucose,
which was then assayed via the glucose oxidase method
(sigma).

data analysis
the data are presented as mean and sem. effects of
drug treatments on cardiac efficiency and substrate metabolism over time were analyzed by two-way repeat measures
anova, with tukey-kramer post hoc test. multiple comparisons of hemodynamic parameters between treatments were
analyzed by anova with dunnettâ€™s or tukey-kramer post
hoc tests, and single comparisons by unpaired t test. cell
culture experiments were carried out at least in duplicate in
each culture. the effect of  xxxd2884xxx  was estimated as %
inhibition of oxidation rate in the corresponding control
cultures. the effect of increasing concentrations of  xxxd2884xxx 
was analyzed by one-way anova with dunnettâ€™s post hoc
test. the effect of time of exposure was assessed in paired
samples by paired t test. a critical p value of 0.05 was adopted.

results
cultured cells
palmitate oxidation
control cells oxidized palmitate at the rate of 0.73 6
0.13 nmol. mg dna21.h21(n = 7)  xxxd2884xxx  exposure for
56 hours (48 hours preincubation plus 8 hours incubation
with palmitate) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition
of palmitate oxidation from 2 mm to 10 mm (fig. 1). there
was no significant inhibition of palmitate oxidation at 1 mm
 xxxd2884xxx . the effect of 2 mm  xxxd2884xxx  increased with the
duration of preincubation, being significant for 48 hours
compared with 1 hour preincubation (20 6 4 compared with
6 6 4% inhibition respectively, p , 0.05, paired t test, n = 6).
the inhibition of palmitate oxidation was not due to decreased
viability of the cells, because trypan blue exclusion indicated
99.5% viability and washout experiments indicated that the
inhibitory effect was reversible after 24 hours washout of the
drug (data not shown).

triglyceride
lipids were extracted from the powdered tissue using
the method originally described by folch et al,14 and triglycerides were subsequently hydrolyzed enzymatically with
determination of the liberated glycerol (boehringer mannheim
triglyceride gpo-pap kit), using a precimat glycerol standard
(boehringer mannheim, germany).

preincubation with  xxxd2884xxx , 2 mm and 5 mm is shown in
figure 2. although the inhibitory effect of 2 mm  xxxd2884xxx 
was specific for palmitate oxidation, producing no significant
effect on glucose oxidation, 5 mm  xxxd2884xxx  produced a
significant inhibitory effect on glucose oxidation compared with
control cultures (fig. 2).

working heart preparation
hemodynamic parameters
cardiac efficiency was relatively stable over the
60 minutes of normal flow in isolated working rat hearts
(figs. 3a and 3b). acute in vitro exposure to either  xxxd2884xxx ,
2 mm, or oxfenicine, 2 mm, had no significant effect on
cardiac efficiency during the 60-minute period of normal flow
(fig. 3a). similarly these drug treatments had no effect on other
hemodynamic parameters measured (table 1). in contrast, pretreatment with  xxxd2884xxx  for 24 hours resulted in a significant
increase in heart rate (by 20%, p , 0.05), cardiac output (by
31%, p , 0.01), and cardiac work (by 29%, p , 0.05) without
any corresponding increase in oxygen consumption compared
with control hearts from pretreated animals (table 1). these
changes were reflected in an increase in cardiac efficiency of approximately 30% (p , 0.02) in hearts from  xxxd2884xxx -pretreated
rats relative to that in hearts from control treated rats (fig. 3b).
heart rates in the pretreated control rat hearts (186 6 11
beats/min) were somewhat lower than for other subgroups, but
this difference was not significant (f = 1.69, p = 0.18, one-way
anova). however pretreatment of rats (control or  xxxd2884xxx ) appeared to increase the oxygen consumption of hearts
significantly when compared with those from non-pretreated
rats (duration of treatment, f = 11.5, p = 0.002; drug treatment, f = 1.84, p = 0.20, two-way anova).
neither acute treatment with  xxxd2884xxx  in vitro, nor
 xxxd2884xxx  pretreatment in vivo, had any significant effect on

the relative controls (fig. 4a and fig. 5). however a metabolic
shift in substrate utilization was demonstrable with acute
oxfenicine treatment in vitro, characterized by a marked,
significant decrease in palmitate oxidation relative to both
control and  xxxd2884xxx  treated hearts (fig. 4a), and a more
modest but significant increase in glucose oxidation relative to
control and  xxxd2884xxx  treated hearts (fig. 4b). the lack of
effect of acute treatment with  xxxd2884xxx  was not a function of
the palmitate concentration (0.4 mm) of the perfusate, because
1 hour of exposure to  xxxd2884xxx  2 mm also failed to affect
palmitate oxidation during normal flow in a separate group of
langendorff-perfused rat hearts exposed to 1.2 mm palmitate
(control 0.92 6 0.28 versus  xxxd2884xxx  1.08 6 0.16 mmol/g

the increased cardiac work following  xxxd2884xxx 
pretreatment did not alter the cardiac concentrations of atp,
glycogen, lactate, or triglyceride relative to those of hearts
from control pretreated animals (table 2).

discussion
the results of the present study indicate that acute exposure to  xxxd2884xxx  for 1 hour at a therapeutic concentration
(2 mm) does not inhibit palmitate oxidation in either isolated
working rat hearts or in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, nor does
it stimulate glucose oxidation; 24 hours in vivo pretreatment
with  xxxd2884xxx  sufficient to achieve plasma levels of 2 mm
also failed to inhibit palmitate oxidation in isolated working rat
hearts. in contrast pre-exposure to  xxxd2884xxx  (in a range of
concentrations that overlaps the therapeutic plasma concentrations of the drug) for 48 hours produced a significant
inhibition of palmitate oxidation in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. thus this â€˜â€˜metabolicâ€™â€™ effect increased with increasing
concentration and exposure time. the absence of acute effect
of  xxxd2884xxx  on substrate selection in the working heart is
in contrast to the shift from palmitate to glucose utilization
observed for the selective cpt-1 inhibitor oxfenicine in parallel experiments.
in addition to effects on palmitate oxidation, a lag phase
was also observed for the onset of effects of  xxxd2884xxx  on
cardiac efficiency in working rat hearts. pretreatment of rats
for 24 hours with  xxxd2884xxx  increased cardiac efficiency by
approximately 30% compared with controls. however, this
effect was not demonstrable with acute in vitro exposure to
 xxxd2884xxx  for 1 hour. moreover the increased cardiac efficiency following 24 hours pretreatment with  xxxd2884xxx  was
not attributable to a reduction in fatty acid oxidation because
palmitate oxidation was unaffected in these hearts. furthermore oxfenicine, which produced a marked decrease in
palmitate oxidation and an increase in glucose oxidation, had
no effect on cardiac efficiency in these non-ischemic hearts.
with respect to the time course of effects on both cardiac
efficiency and metabolism, the reason(s) for a lag phase in
onset is not clear, but potentially could be due to slow
accumulation of  xxxd2884xxx  by the tissue particularly at its
site(s) of action. deschamps et al8 have proposed this slow
accumulation as an explanation for the slow onset of effects on
fatty acid metabolism by hepatocytes. alternatively, effects on
efficiency might also reflect some indirect action in vivo. not
all effects of  xxxd2884xxx  demonstrate a lag phase because we
have previously demonstrated that 2 mm  xxxd2884xxx  exerts
some acute effects in vitro including protection against
diastolic dysfunction in langendorff perfused rat hearts under

both groups.

conditions of ischemia/reperfusion,5 and inhibitory effects
on superoxide generation by isolated neutrophils.7 in the
langendorff perfused rat heart the effect of  xxxd2884xxx 
occurred in the absence of changes in long-chain  xxxd3156xxx 
concentrations.5 we interpreted this as due to simultaneous
inhibition of cpt-1 and â€“2. however, in light of the current
data, a longer period of exposure is necessary for the metabolic
effect of  xxxd2884xxx  to be fully manifest.
although the lag phase for metabolic effects of
 xxxd2884xxx  is consistent with the observations of deschamps
et al,8 who found that 5 mm  xxxd2884xxx  inhibited palmitate
oxidation by hepatocytes after 72 hours exposure but not after
acute exposure, the current data on working rat hearts are at
odds with those of jeffrey et al.6 these authors reported
increased cardiac output for no change in oxygen consumption
during 1 hour of in vitro exposure to 2 mm  xxxd2884xxx  in
normoxic working rat hearts, accompanied by a switch from
fatty acid to carbohydrate utilization. the reasons for the
apparent discrepancy between our data and those of jeffrey
et al6 are unclear. failure to demonstrate an acute effect of
 xxxd2884xxx  in the current study was not a function of the
palmitate concentration of the perfusate, because separate

experiments in langendorff perfused hearts with 1.2 mm
palmitate also demonstrated that acute treatment with  xxxd2884xxx  had no effect on metabolism. moreover the previously
described metabolic effect of oxfenicine was detected under
the conditions of the current experiments. furthermore, the
absence of an acute effect of  xxxd2884xxx  on metabolism is
consistent with the lag phase on palmitate metabolism in
cardiomyocytes. there are a number of methodological differences between the two studies. in the experiment of jeffrey
et al,6 neither control nor  xxxd2884xxx  treated hearts used
exogenous glucose, increased carbohydrate utilization being
accounted for by increased lactate metabolism. these experiments were conducted without the presence of insulin and at
a lower glucose concentration than used in our experiments.
moreover jeffrey et al estimated substrate utilization by nmr
analysis of the hearts at the end of perfusion. this method
estimates the contribution of the different 13c-labeled substrates as estimated from the distribution of 13c in glutamate at
the end of perfusion. although no direct comparison of these
two methods appears to have been made, discrepant results
have previously been reported between studies using these
two methods of estimating palmitate utilization in the presence
of  xxxd3437xxx .15,16
recently, it has been found that  xxxd2884xxx  improves
symptomatic status in patients with decompensated aortic
stenosis17 and also in those with stable congestive heart failure,
irrespective of the presence or absence of significant coronary
artery disease.18 thus the clinical effects of  xxxd2884xxx  extend
to circumstances in which myocardial ischemia may be absent.
the magnitude of the increase in cardiac efficiency by
 xxxd2884xxx  pretreatment under normal flow conditions in the
current study was quite substantial (approximately 30%), and
is consistent with these clinical data. this relatively large
effect on cardiac efficiency under conditions of normal flow
distinguishes  xxxd2884xxx  from other metabolic anti- xxxd1914xxx 
drugs. although an increase in glucose concentration has been
shown to increase efficiency under aerobic conditions in one
study,19 the effects of â€˜â€˜metabolicâ€™â€™ agents such as oxfenicine,
 xxxd3083xxx , and  xxxd3437xxx  on efficiency have in general
been manifest in ischemic models.16,20,21 greater effects of
metabolic agents might be expected in ischemia during which
uncoupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation lead to detrimental accumulation of lactate. metabolic effects of  xxxd2884xxx  remain of relevance in ischemia but would be expected to
occur after longer-term treatment.
given the dissociation in the present study between
metabolic effects of oxfenicine and  xxxd2884xxx  and changes
in efficiency, alternative mechanisms should be considered.
none were suggested by the results obtained. mitochondrial
uncoupling proteins (ucps) may decrease efficiency of
cardiac atp production in normoxic myocardium.22 in addition, endogenous peroxynitrite formation has been shown to
limit cardiac efficiency in isolated working rat hearts even
under conditions of normal flow.23 however, whether  xxxd2884xxx  can alter levels of ucps or peroxynitrite in myocardium
is unknown. alternatively, there is some evidence to suggest
that calcium sensitization at the level of the troponin/tropomyosin complex may modulate cardiac efficiency.24  xxxd2884xxx , in high concentrations, has been shown to increase

calcium sensitivity in cardiac myofibrils,25 and to increase calcium binding to  xxxg2307xxx  in skinned skeletal muscle.26 however, there is no information available to indicate whether it has
a similar effect on intact cardiac muscle at lower concentrations.

limitations
neonatal cardiomyoctes were used in the isolated cell
studies. although neonatal cardiomyocytes have been shown
to express the hepatic isoform of cpt-1,27 and therefore are not
identical to adult cardiomyocytes, we have shown previously
that  xxxd2884xxx  inhibits the hepatic isoform of cpt-1 in a
manner similar to that of the muscle isoform but is a little less
potent on the former.4
at 2 mm,  xxxd2884xxx  appeared to inhibit palmitate
oxidation in cardiomyocytes without any secondary stimulant
effect on glucose oxidation. in light of the smaller numbers of
cultures used for glucose oxidation it is possible that a small
effect of 2 mm  xxxd2884xxx  on glucose oxidation may have
gone undetected. however, 5 mm  xxxd2884xxx  significantly
inhibited glucose oxidation to approximately the same degree
as it inhibited palmitate oxidation. this lack of specificity with
increasing concentration may be related to the known calcium l-channel blocking effect of the drug at higher concentrations, which has been demonstrated in chicken embryonic
cardiomyocytes.28 consistent with this possibility, we have previously observed a small negative inotropic effect of  xxxd2884xxx  at 5 mm in isolated rat hearts (unpublished).
control rats in the pretreated group tended to have somewhat lower heart rates than in other subgroups, while hearts
from both pretreated groups had higher oxygen consumption
than those that were not pretreated. this might in theory reflect
the impact of prior anesthesia and/or the vehicle used for percutaneous application of  xxxd2884xxx . while these results were
unexpected, they do not invalidate the comparison between the
two pretreated groups.
in conclusion, in the non-ischemic working rat heart,
 xxxd2884xxx  increases myocardial efficiency by a mechanism(s)
that is largely, or entirely, independent of its effects on cpt.
the study results also suggest that experiments in normoxic
myocardium may fail to demonstrate the effects of â€˜â€˜metabolicâ€™â€™ anti- xxxd1914xxx  agents on cardiac efficiency. further studies
are required to compare the effects of  xxxd2884xxx  with those
of agents such as oxfenicine as regards myocardial efficiency and
metabolism in severe global ischemia, a condition under which
the metabolic effect of these agents may become more important.
