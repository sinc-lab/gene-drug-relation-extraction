introduction

chemokines are a family of small peptides that act as
chemoattractants and activators of specific types of leukocyte
to mediate a variety of immune and inflammatory responses
through their binding and subsequent activation of specific
receptors on the cell surface. these receptors belong to a large
family of seven-transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors
[1–3] that includes the c, cc, cxc and cx3c subfamilies [4]. in
addition to a role in leukocyte trafficking, chemokines and their
receptors have other biological roles and are involved in
haematopoiesis, angiogenesis, metastasis and hiv-1 infection
[1–3]. the  xxxg371xxx , originally identified as a
receptor for mip-1a, mip-1b and  xxxg363xxx  [5–7], has been shown
to be the co-receptor for the most commonly transmitted
hiv-1 strains that predominate during the early stages of
infection [8–10]. hiv-1 initiates entry into cells through binding
to the  xxxg388xxx , but cd4 binding alone is insufficient to
allow viral fusion and entry and the virus requires a second
receptor to reduce the energy barrier for these processes [11].
humans that are homozygous for a 32 bp deletion in the gene
encoding for ccr5 tend to have a high degree of resistance and
heterozygous individuals tend to have a slower rate of hiv-1
disease progression, confirming the role of ccr5 in facilitating
viral entry [12–16]. immune function appears to be normal in
such individuals and for this reason; ccr5 represents an
attractive drug target for inhibition of hiv-1 entry and has led to
the search for ccr5 antagonists, as new anti-retroviral
treatments [17–22].  xxxd2542xxx  is a highly selective, orally
bioavailable, small molecule ccr5 antagonist with potent
anti-hiv-1 activity, currently undergoing clinical evaluation
for the treatment of hiv-1 infection [23]. the compound has
potent broad-spectrum activity against a range of hiv-1 isolates
(for detailed review see [24]) and in phase ii studies
has been shown to reduce viral load in hiv-1 infected patients,
thereby confirming the validity of this approach [25].
a key challenge faced with the development of  xxxd2542xxx 
had been its low affinity at the ccr5 of common laboratory
animals, i.e. ki > 10 mm for mouse, rat and dog recombinant
ccr5 (unpublished observations). this has not been an issue
for the determination of the potential anti-hiv activity where
human leukocytes can be used in vitro [23,24], however, for
mechanism-based safety and toxicology assessments a
laboratory species is required. ideally, these assessments
should be conducted in a test species that expresses the target
receptor and which demonstrates the same pharmacological
profile to that expected in human. since previous studies had
shown that human and macaque ccr5 genes have very close
homology [26–29] and given that macaques are a relevant
toxicology species [30], we sought to determine if the binding

and functional properties of a range of chemokines and
 xxxd2542xxx  at macaque ccr5 were similar to human ccr5. to
do this we cloned and expressed the macaque ccr5 in hek293 cells. we then characterised the binding and functional
properties of recombinant macaque ccr5 in comparison with
the human recombinant ccr5 expressed in hek-293 cells.

methods

2.1.

materials

due to the high degree of sequence homology between human
and macaque chemokines, human recombinant chemokines
were used in these studies. chemokines and biotinylated
human recombinant mip-1b were purchased from r&d systems
(london, uk). lyophilised chemokines were dissolved in
phosphate buffered saline (pbs) and stored at 20 8c in aliquots.
[125i]-mip-1b (2000 ci/mmol) was purchased from perkin elmer
las, uk and [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  (16 ci/mmol) was custom synthesised by amersham biosciences. all other chemicals were from
sigma. cell culture reagents were obtained from life technologies, merelbeke, belgium.  xxxd2542xxx  ( xxxd2542xxx ) was synthesized by pfizer global research and development, sandwich,
kent, uk.

2.2.

culture of rhesus macaque kidney cells

primary rhesus macaque kidney (pmk) cells (ecacc 98020308,
salisbury, uk) were cultured in eagle’s minimum essential
medium (emem, invitrogen) containing 5% fcs, 2 mm lglutamine, 1 non-essential amino acids (neaa), at 37 8c in
a 5% co2 humidified incubator.

2.3.

macaque ccr5 dna and sequence

macaque ccr5 gene-specific oligonucleotide primer pairs
(eurogentec, southampton, uk) were designed using the
sequence deposited in the nih genbank1 genetic sequence
database (accession number af005660), and the vector nti
dna sequence analysis software (informax inc., bethesda,
usa). primer sequences were: (50 ) ccctcgagggccgccaccatggactatcaagtgtcaagtcc and (30 ) cgggatcccgtcacaagcccacagatatttcc. an xhoi restriction site and a
kozak transcription initiation motif were incorporated in the
50 primer, immediately prior to the initial methionine atg
codon, and a bamhi restriction site was incorporated in the 30
primer. since there are no introns in the coding region of ccr5
in human, rhesus genomic dna isolated from pmk cells was
used as a template for the pcr. genomic dna was isolated

biochemical pharmacology 71 (2005) 163–172

from approximately 4  107 pmk cells using a genomic dna kit
(promega, southampton, uk). pcr amplification of the ccr5
coding sequence from genomic dna isolated from pmk cells
was performed using a proof-reading dna polymerase
reagent (expand, roche, lewes, uk), using the proprietary
protocol accompanying the polymerase. pcr products were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the macaque
ccr5 coding sequence was directionally subcloned into the
pcdna3.1() plasmid vector (invitrogen, paisley, uk) as an
xhoi/bamhi insert. the pcdna3.1() vector includes a cmv
promoter for transient and stable mammalian cell expression
studies. the authenticity of the ccr5 sequence was confirmed
by nucleotide sequencing (lark technologies, takely, uk).

the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm hepes containing 1 mm cacl2 and protease inhibitor cocktail (boehringer
mannheim complete protease inhibitor tablet)). the cells
were then homogenised with an ultra-turrax t25 (3  10 s
bursts) and centrifuged for 20 min at 48,000  g at 4 8c. the
supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in lysis
buffer and centrifuged as before. the final pellet was
resuspended in lysis buffer, aliquoted and stored at 80 8c.
the protein concentration was determined using a coomassie
blue-based assay kit (sigma). membranes were also prepared
from hek-293 cells stably expressing the human recombinant
ccr5 (previously constructed at pfizer [24]) cultured and
harvested as described for hek-293 cell expressing macaque
ccr5.

generation of mccr5 cell line
2.7.

the pcdna3.1() plasmid containing macaque ccr5 cdna was
transfected into hek-293 cells, using lipofactamine reagent
and protocol (invitrogen). the cells were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem, invitrogen) supplemented with
10% foetal calf serum (fcs), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1  nonessential amino acids (invitrogen) and  xxxd2191xxx  (0.8 mg/ml)
for approximately 2 weeks. cells expressing the macaque ccr5
gene survived as individual cell foci and were subject to
selection using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (facs).
cells were isolated by their ability to bind biotinylated human
recombinant mip-1b, thereby gating via spa-fluorescence.
individual cell clone populations were then expanded and
screened for responsiveness to human recombinant mip-1b in a
calcium flux assay using a fluorometric imaging plate reader
(flipr, molecular devices, wokingham), as previously
described by combadiere et al., 1996 [7].

2.5.

functional assays

hek-293 cells expressing macaque ccr5 were seeded into 96well black-wall clear bottomed poly-d-lysine coated plates
(fisher scientific) at a density of 7.5  104 cells/well and cultured
overnight in a 5% co2 humidified incubator at 37 8c. after this
time the cells were washed in hanks buffer containing 1.6 mm
cacl2 and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.2 (calcium flux buffer) and then
incubated for 2 h in  xxxd2531xxx  assay dye (molecular devices,
uk). cells werethen washed, as before, and 160 ml of calcium flux
buffer added to each well. plates were loaded into a flipr and
calcium release was monitored before, during and after the
additionof mip-1b (20 nm) at an excitationwavelength of 488 nm
and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. inhibition of mip-1b
mediated elevation of intracellular calcium by  xxxd2542xxx  (0.51–
1 mm) was assessed in quadruplicate. mip-1b (20 nm in well) was
added following a 4 min incubation period with either antagonist or vehicle. fluorescence was measured over a total of 8 min
to investigate any direct effects of  xxxd2542xxx  on cell signalling,
and inhibitory effects on mip-1b-mediated signalling.

membrane preparation for binding experiments

cells were grown to until they were 80% confluent before being
harvested into ice-cold dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline
(invitrogen) and centrifuged at 350  g for 10 min at 4 8c using
a bench top centrifuge. the supernatant was discarded and

radioligand binding studies

[125i]-mip-1b binding was performed as described by combadiere et al. [7] in 50 mm hepes buffer containing 1 mm cacl2,
5 mm mgcl2 and 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (ph 7.4) at room
temperature for 2 h in a total volume of 100 ml using 7.5–10 mg
of membrane protein per well. non-specific binding (nsb) was
defined using 100 nm mip-1b. for [125i]-mip-1b competition
binding studies with  xxxd2542xxx , non-specific binding was
defined using 10 mm uk-396,794, a similar small molecule
ccr5 antagonist synthesised at pfizer laboratories. [3h] xxxd2542xxx  binding was performed as described for [125i]mip-1b binding using 2.5–5 mg of membrane protein per well.
saturation binding was performed in duplicate wells using 12
concentrations of [125i]-mip-1b (0.01–1 nm) or [3h]- xxxd2542xxx 
(0.25–35 nm). assays were terminated by separation of bound
and free radioligand by filtration through gf/b filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine (pei). filters were counted on
a cobra ii gamma counter. competition binding experiments
were performed using a sub-kd concentration of [125i]-mip-1b
(0.1 nm), in the presence and absence of different chemokines
or  xxxd2542xxx . ic50 values were determined using 10 half-log
serial dilutions in duplicate. assays were terminated by
separation of bound and free radioligand by filtration through
gf/b packard unifilter plates presoaked in 0.3% pei. unifilters
were counted on a topcount liquid scintillation counter
(packard). for association experiments membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.1 nm [125i]-mip-1b or 5 nm [3h] xxxd2542xxx  for various times from 1 min to 3 h in the presence
and absence of 100 nm unlabelled mip-1b or 10 mm  xxxd2542xxx .
for [125i]-mip-1b dissociation experiments, membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.1 nm [125i]-mip-1b for 2 h to
allow association of [125i]-mip-1b. after this time an excess
(100 nm) of unlabelled mip-1b was added to each well at
various times, and dissociation followed from 1 min to 4 h.
plates for kinetic experiments were processed as described for
competition assays. for [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  dissociation experiments, membrane homogenates were incubated with 5 nm
[3h]- xxxd2542xxx  for 2 h and dissociation was initiated by the
addition of 50 mm  xxxd2542xxx . initially, dissociation assays with
[3h]- xxxd2542xxx  were performed over 8 h at room tempertaure,
but were extended to 51 h for the human ccr5 due to
incomplete dissociation after 8 h. in these experiments, the
assay buffer included antibiotics (penicillin (5 u/ml) and
streptomycin (0.5 mg/ml) and protease inhibitors (boehringer

mannheim complete protese inhibitor cocktail) to prevent
degradation of the membrane homogenates.

data analysis

data are reported as mean  s.e. mean of n experiments.
functional responses were measured as peak fluorescence
intensity minus basal. data were analysed using the nonlinear regression functions within prism (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa). the equilibrium dissociation
constant (kd) and the binding site density (bmax) were
derived from radioligand saturation curves using the
langmuir equation rl = rtl/(kd + l) where l is the free ligand
concentration, rl is the concentration of receptor-bound
ligand at equilibrium, and rt is the total receptor concentration. ic50 (the concentration of compound producing 50%
inhibition of specific binding) and hill coefficients were
derived from fitting to a four-parameter logistic equation.
curve fitting was not constrained when data fully reached
maximum and minimum plateaus, but was constrained
where compounds had low affinity and did not fully inhibit
binding. apparent ki values were derived when hill slopes
were not different from unity using the cheng and prusoff
equation; ki = ic50/(1+[l]/kd) where [l] is the free concentration of radioligand and kd is the appropriate equilibrium
dissociation constant derived from the saturation analysis
[31]. in kinetic experiments, the observed association rate
constant (kobs) and the association and dissociation halflives were derived directly from the one-phase non-linear
exponential models within prism. the dissociation rate
constant (koff in units of time1) was calculated as 0.693/t1/2
1
nm1)
off, the association rate constant (kon in units of time
was derived by the pseudo first-order method [32] which
takes into account the concentration of radioligand used, the
observed association rate constant (kobs in units of time1)
and the dissociation rate constant (koff) such that
(kon = kobs  koff)/[l]. the ratio of koff/kon was also used to
estimate kd. binding data from saturation and kinetic
experiments were compared using two-sample, unpaired,
equal variance student’s t-tests. differences were considered to be statistically significant when p-values <0.05.

results

3.1.
macaque ccr5 sequence and creation of
stable cell lines
analysis of the macaque ccr5 gene sequence showed that it
encodes 352 amino acids. as previously reported [26–29]
comparison with the human ccr5 gene sequence reveals
close homology and a difference of only eight amino acids; the
majority of these substitutions being of similar amino acids.
the locations of the amino acid differences are shown in fig. 1.
to characterise the pharmacological properties of the macaque ccr5, cdna encoding the receptor sequence was stably
expressed in hek-293 cells. as human mip-1b is known to bind
to macaque ccr5 [28,33] cells transfected with pcdna3.1()
plasmid containing the macaque ccr5 cdna were sorted on
their ability to bind biotinylated human recombinant mip-1b
using facs analysis. this process led to the selection of 18
clones that were subsequently used for functional assessment
in an intracellular calcium release assay. of these, cells from
clone 7, demonstrated the greatest response to mip-1b and
were expanded for further characterization (fig. 2). untransfected parental hek-293 cells failed to respond to mip-1b
confirming that the responses in transfected cells was
mediated through the macaque ccr5.

3.2.

[125i]-mip-1b binding studies

using membranes prepared from homogenates of hek-293
cells, the kinetic and equilibrium binding properties of [125i]mip-1b at macaque and human ccr5 were compared. fig. 3
shows that the time-course of association and dissociation of
[125i]-mip-1b at human and macaque ccr5 were similar.
specific binding of [125i]-mip-1b was time-dependent and fully
reversible and was achieved after the addition of an excess of
unlabelled mip-1b (100 nm) once equilibrium had been
reached. saturation binding analysis confirmed that [125i]mip-1b bound to ccr5 from macaque and human with the
same high affinity. table 1 shows that kd values estimated
from saturation analysis were also in good agreement with the
kd obtained from the ratios of koff/kon for both human and

largest response. the data shown are from a single
experiment.

macaque ccr5. the kinetic binding properties of [125i]-mip-1b
binding to human and macaque ccr5 were also comparable;
the off-rate and dissociation half-life values were very similar,
while on-rate and association half-life values were less than 3fold different. the apparent faster association rate may be
related to the higher level of receptor expression in cells
expressing the human ccr5, as indicated by a higher bmax

value (1979  230 fmol/mg protein) compared with cells
expressing the macaque ccr5 (452  100 fmol/mg protein).
competition experiments were performed to compare the
ability of a panel of chemokines to inhibit the binding of [125i]mip-1b to homogenates of hek-293 cells expressing either the
macaque or human ccr5. chemokines were first tested for
their ability to inhibit [125i]-mip-1b binding at 100 nm. those
inhibiting binding by more than 50% (mip-1a, mip-1b,  xxxg363xxx ,
 xxxg357xxx , mcp-2,  xxxg364xxx , hcc-1) were analysed over a wider
concentration range to determine pki values. as fig. 4 shows
the classical ccr5 chemokines, mip-1a, mip-1b, and  xxxg363xxx 
as well as hcc-1,  xxxg357xxx , mcp-2,  xxxg364xxx , significantly inhibited
binding (>50%) of [125i]-mip-1b to macaque and human ccr5

although mcp-2 had high affinity (ic50 values of 1.62 and

the competition curves were shallow (0.46 and 0.72) and for
this reason ki values were not calculated.

binding experiments with  xxxd2542xxx , pki values were not
calculated. in flipr experiments,  xxxd2542xxx  was shown to be a
potent functional antagonist at macaque ccr5 with an ic50
value for inhibition of mip-1b induced intracellular calcium

ic50 of 12.07  1.89 nm (n = 8) obtained for the human ccr5.

[3h]- xxxd2542xxx  binding studies

the direct binding properties of [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  at ccr5 from
macaque and human were compared using similar methods
as described for [125i]-mip-1b binding. as table 3 shows,
saturation binding analysis confirmed that [3h]- xxxd2542xxx 
bound to ccr5 from macaque and human with similar high
affinity. in addition, the time course of association of [3h] xxxd2542xxx  to macaque and human ccr5 was also similar with

the binding of  xxxd2542xxx  to human and macaque ccr5 was
compared in a standard [125i]-mip-1b competition binding
assay. as fig. 6 shows,  xxxd2542xxx  was a potent inhibitor of
[125i]-mip-1b binding to the macaque ccr5 with an ic50 of
17.50  1.24 nm (n = 5), a value that was within 2-fold of that

although the association of [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  to macaque and

from human ccr5 was significantly slower than from

macaque ccr5. dissociation of [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  from macaque

unlabelled  xxxd2542xxx , while in contrast there was still more
than 50% of added [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  bound to human ccr5. even

after 51 h there was still approximately 15% remaining. the kd
value estimated from koff/kon for macaque ccr5 was in
reasonable (within 3-fold) agreement of that estimated from
saturation analysis, but for human ccr5 was approximately
10-fold lower than that estimated from saturation analysis.
this difference is almost certainly related to equilibrium
conditions not being reached in saturation experiments due to
the slow-offset of [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  from human ccr5. the kd
value estimated from koff/kon may actually be a more reliable
estimate of the true affinity of  xxxd2542xxx  for the human
receptor. the slow dissociation rate of  xxxd2542xxx  from the
human ccr5 would also mean that it is highly unlikely that
the plateau in the association time course shown in fig. 7
represents establishment of equilibrium. indeed, the mathematical model described by motulsky and mahan [34] predicts
that the time take to reach equilibrium using a kd concentration of radioligand, is 5 times the dissociation half-life. at
concentrations >kd this is halved. thus, an incubation time in
excess of 35 h would be needed for [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  to reach
equilibrium at human ccr5. it is also likely that this accounts
for the steep slope factors observed in [125i]-mip-1b competition binding experiments with  xxxd2542xxx .

discussion

in this study, cdna encoding the rhesus macaque chemokine
ccr5 was isolated from pmk cells and expressed in hek-293
cells as a stable cell line. our data confirms previous reports
that the rhesus macaque ccr5 sequence encodes 352 amino
acids and shows close homology (98%) to the human ccr5
sequence [26–29]. as most chemokine receptors, including
ccr5, are coupled to pertussis-sensitive heterotrimeric g
proteins that signal through intracellular calcium mobilization and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate formation [35] we used
mip-1b evoked increases in intracellular calcium to confirm
functional activity. in addition, we confirmed that these
responses were mediated through the macaque ccr5 by
demonstrating that non-transfected parental hek-293 cells
were unresponsive to mip-1b.
having confirmed that our cell line expressing recombinant
ccr5 was functionally active we then investigated if the direct
binding properties of [125i]-mip-1b at macaque ccr5 were
similar to human ccr5. therefore, the equilibrium and kinetic
binding properties of [125i]-mip-1b at human and macaque
ccr5 were determined. these experiments demonstrated that
human [125i]-mip-1b binds to macaque ccr5 with the same
high affinity as human ccr5 and with similar kinetic
constants. overall, these data suggest that the binding site
for mip-1b is similar across these species and that differences
in the amino acid sequences in the receptors do not appear to
influence the binding affinity of mip-1b.
competition experiments were performed to compare the
specificity of the recombinant macaque ccr5 for chemokines.
our data confirm that mip-1a, mip-1b and  xxxg363xxx , had the
highest affinity for macaque ccr5, consistent with the known
pharmacology of human ccr5 [6,36,37]. of notable exception
was  xxxg364xxx , which is reported to bind to human ccr5 with
greater affinity than our data indicates [36]. our data show that
hcc-1,  xxxg357xxx , mcp-2 and  xxxg364xxx  bind to macaque and human

ccr5 with relatively moderate affinity and confirms the
known promiscuous nature of chemokine receptors
[6,36,37]. all other chemokines tested bound with lower
affinity (<50% inhibition at 100 nm). overall, the relative
affinities of the chemokines tested for the macaque ccr5 were
similar to those obtained with human ccr5.
the finding that the direct binding properties of mip-1b at
human and macaque ccr5 are similar is consistent with the
known close homology between the receptor gene sequences
[26–29] and the conserved nature of the chemokines expressed
in human and primates. rhesus macaque simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) is often used as a model system for hiv-1
infection because macaque ccr5 supports entry of hiv-1
[26,38,39]. furthermore, recombinant human  xxxg363xxx , mip-1a
and mip-1b are known to bind to macaque ccr5 and suppress
simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) replication [28,33].
previous studies have shown that the second extracellular
loop of human ccr5 is critical for high affinity binding and for
signalling of mip-1a, mip-1b and  xxxg363xxx  [40]. our data suggest
that the single amino acid difference at position 171 (arginine
in macaque, lysine in human) does not affect the affinity,
specificity or kinetics of chemokine binding. although amino
acid differences between macaque and human ccr5 do not
appear to drastically affect the affinity of chemokines for these
receptors, the same may not hold true for small molecule
ccr5 antagonists. indeed, a single amino acid difference
(isoleucine at position 198 in human, methionine at the same
position in macaque) has been shown to determine the
sensitivity of macaque ccr5 to the antiviral activity of the
small molecule inhibitor sch-c [29]. given that sequence
differences between macaque and humans may be important
for small molecule inhibitors we wanted to verify if the similar
binding properties of human and macaque ccr5 observed
with chemokines would also hold for  xxxd2542xxx . as nonclinical testing of  xxxd2542xxx  revealed that it has low affinity for
ccr5 expressed in the standard toxicological species; mouse,
rat and dog, we set out to identify an alternative species that
could be used to evaluate mechanism-related safety and
toxicology of the compound. to validate macaque as a
relevant species we needed to demonstrate that the pharmacological profile of macaque ccr5 is similar to that of human
ccr5. in competition binding experiments at the macaque
ccr5 our data confirmed that  xxxd2542xxx  has similar low
nanomolar binding affinity to that observed with the human
ccr5. furthermore, as with the human receptor, the binding
affinity at the macaque ccr5translates into potent functional
antagonism as demonstrated by dose-dependent inhibition of
mip-1b-induced intracellular calcium release.
direct binding studies using [3h]- xxxd2542xxx  confirmed
that the compound has high affinity for macaque and human
ccr5. however, when the binding kinetics of [3h]- xxxd2542xxx 
at macaque and human ccr5 were compared, significant
differences in the dissociation rate emerged. the dissociation half-life of  xxxd2542xxx  from human ccr5 was approximately 10-fold longer than from macaque. this slow rate of
dissociation of  xxxd2542xxx  from human ccr5 confirms the
findings of watson et al. [41] who reported that the
dissociation rate of  xxxd2542xxx  and other ccr5 antagonists,
including tak779, sch-c, sch-d and gw873140 ( xxxd198xxx )
from human ccr5 is significantly slower than mip-1a. in the

biochemical pharmacology 71 (2005) 163–172

watson study, an indirect measure of  xxxd2542xxx  dissociation
was made by following the association of [125i]-mip-1a at 4 8c
to ccr5 after pre-treatment with  xxxd2542xxx . these methodological differences, in particular, assay temperature, as
kinetics are temperature dependent [32], may explain the
longer dissociation half-life for  xxxd2542xxx  (>136 h) reported
by watson. despite the differences in absolute values, these
data indicate that a slow dissociation from human ccr5 is
not a unique property of  xxxd2542xxx , and is common to other
ccr5 antagonists. with such a slow rate of dissociation from
human ccr5, mass action principles do not apply, i.e. the
rate of on-set does not ever equal the rate of off-set. thus,
with increasing time and as long as there are available
receptors,  xxxd2542xxx  will continue to associate until either
ligand is depleted or receptors are saturated. such properties
could beneficial for antiviral drugs. the finding that the
dissociation of mip-1b from macaque and human ccr5 were
similar but that  xxxd2542xxx  dissociation was 10 times slower
from human ccr5, suggests that while differences in amino
acid sequence between macaque and human do not affect
endogenous chemokine binding they may affect the
binding of small molecule antagonists. a consequence of
these data is that in vivo the duration of action of  xxxd2542xxx 
at the macaque ccr5 receptor may not be as sustained as in
human. therefore, receptor occupancy would need to
be sustained through adequate plasma concentrations of
drug.
overall, these data confirm that the direct binding properties of [125i]-mip-1b at macaque ccr5 are similar to the human
receptor. compared to ccr5 from human,  xxxd2542xxx  was
shown to dissociate more quickly from macaque however, as
with the human receptor,  xxxd2542xxx  was shown to be a high
affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque ccr5
thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable
species in which to evaluate mechanism related toxicology of
ccr5 antagonists like  xxxd2542xxx .
