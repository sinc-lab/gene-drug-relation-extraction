the aim of the study is to explore the
contribution of genetic factors related
either to drug metabolism (cytochrome
p450 2c9) or to drug target ( xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide reductase) to variability in the
response to  xxxd59xxx  among 222
healthy volunteers after a single oral
dose. associations between a pharmacodynamic index (reduction in  xxxg750xxx 
activity and international normalized ratio [inr] change) and several genetic
polymorphisms ( xxxg2418xxx : ⴚ4931t>c,
ⴚ4451c>a, ⴚ2659g>c, ⴚ1877a>g,
ⴚ1639g>a, 497c>g, 1173c>t, and

cyp2c9*3) were investigated using haplotype and univariate analyses.  xxxg2418xxx 
haplotypes were associated with the pharmacologic response, and this association can be explained only by the effect of
the ⴚ1639g>a polymorphism (or alternatively by 1173c>t, which is in complete
association with it). indeed, it explains
about one third of the variability of the
pharmacologic response (37% of factor
vii decrease and 30% of inr change).
moreover, the previously observed effect
of the cyp2c9*3 allele is independent of
the  xxxg2418xxx  gene effect. these 2 polymor-

phisms account for up to 50% of the
interindividual variability. the simple
genotyping of 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps),  xxxg2418xxx  ⴚ1639g>a
or 1173c>t and the cyp2c9*3 polymorphisms, could thus predict a high risk of
overdose before initiation of anticoagulation with  xxxd59xxx , and provide a
safer and more individualized anticoagulant therapy. (blood. 2005;106:135-140)

introduction
oral anticoagulants, including warfarin and  xxxd59xxx  (ac),
are the most widely prescribed drugs for the prevention and
treatment of arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders. however, warfarin was recently identified as a causal agent in 10% of
cases of all hospital admissions for adverse drug reactions in
england.1 the management of anticoagulant therapy is challenging
because patients exhibit a large variability in their doseanticoagulant effect response. a narrow range for a therapeutic
effect makes individual dosing necessary. this interindividual
variability is known to depend on environmental factors, but a
genetic influence has also been demonstrated.2-6 the cytochrome
p450 2c9 (cyp2c9) is the main enzyme responsible for the
hepatic metabolism of oral anticoagulants such as ac and warfarin.
the cyp2c9 has been demonstrated to be polymorphic, and its
genetic variability has been shown to be associated with variations
in the levels of enzyme activity.4,7,8 in humans, 3 major alleles have
been found: (1) cyp2c9*1 (wild-type or reference allele) cys144/
leu359; (2) cyp2c9*2, arg144/leu359; and (3) cyp2c9*3,
cys144/ile359.9-11 due to an impaired metabolic capacity, patients
having at least one cyp2c9*3 allele require, on average, a lower

dose of ac than homozygotes for the cyp2c9*1 allele.8,11
moreover, it has recently been shown in our laboratory that the
cyp2c9*3 allele influences the ac response. up to 14% of the
interindividual variability of the ac pharmacodynamic response
can be explained based on this genotypic-haplotypic approach
among white subjects.12
recent works have also suggested that genetic variations within
 xxxd3522xxx –dependent protein genes could also be useful for
predicting anticoagulant response.13-16 the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide
reductase multiprotein complex 1 ( xxxg2418xxx ) gene has been
hypothesized to play a role in the variability of the ac response
based upon a seminal study showing that an intronic 1173c⬎t
polymorphism was associated with warfarin dose requirement.
patients carrying the t allele required a lower dose of warfarin
compared with those carrying the c allele (the mean daily dose
decreased 43% for homozygous tt carriers and 22% for
heterozygous).16
the aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of genetic
variability of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene, in addition to the 1173c⬎t
polymorphism, on the pharmacodynamic outcome after ac intake.

patients, materials, and methods
subjects
the study population was the same as the one used in our previous analysis
of the cyp2c9 haplotype.12 enrolled in this study were 263 healthy
volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age. among them, 230 were white
and dna samples were available for 222 (145 males and 77 females). in
accordance with the declaration of helsinki, each subject provided written
informed consent before participation. the study was approved by the
comité consultatif pour la protection des personnes participant à la
recherche biomédicale of pitié-salpétrière hospital (assistance publique
des hôpitaux de paris local ethics committee) and complies with french
bioethics laws. this study took place at the center for clinical investigation
of saint-antoine university hospital, paris.
the cyp2c9 genotype was previously12 determined. the observed
frequencies of minor alleles cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3 among the 222
subjects studied in the present setting were 0.14 and 0.086, respectively.
methods
selection of polymorphisms in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene. the  xxxg2418xxx  gene
polymorphisms studied in this report were selected from public databases
(http://pga.gs.washington.edu/data/ xxxg2418xxx /welcome.html). of the polymorphisms, 29 have been identified from a population including 24 african
individuals and 23 european individuals, and 13 haplotypes have been
inferred (frequency ranged from 1% to 17%) from 17 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) with allele frequency of more than 4% (http://
pga.gs.washington.edu/data/ xxxg2418xxx /welcome.html). all the polymorphisms
described by d’andrea et al16 with a frequency more than 1% were listed
within this database (ie, 3462c⬎t in exon 3, 1173c⬎t in intron 1,
3730g⬎a in the 3⬘ untranslated region [utr]) and among the 17 snps
mentioned in this paragraph.
for the present study, we used the tag’n’tell software (http://
snp. xxxg439xxx .ki.se/tagntell/) to identify and select the minimum number of snps
that capture more than 95% of the haplotypic diversity referred to as the
haplotype tagging snps (htsnps).17 in this way, 6 snps were selected: 5
(⫺4931t⬎c, ⫺4451c⬎a, ⫺2659g⬎c, ⫺1877a⬎g, ⫺1639g⬎a) located in the 5⬘ flanking region of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene and 1 (497c⬎g) in
intron 1 (table 1). in view of the recent findings suggesting a potential
effect of the 1173c⬎t intronic polymorphism on the pharmacodynamic
response, this snp was also selected for genotyping even though it was not
identified as an htsnp.

ⴚ2659g>c, ⴚ1877a>g, ⴚ1639g>a, 497c>g) and 1173c>t snp.
for the ⫺4931t⬎c polymorphism, a real-time polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) allelic discrimination assay was designed using primer express

software (applied biosystems, courtaboeuf, france) and used a forward
primer (5⬘gcaacataacaacaactcatctctaatg 3⬘), a reverse
primer (5⬘ggccaggctggtctcaaac 3⬘), and 2 minor groove-binding
(mgb) probes, namely 5⬘fam-atccaccctccttgg 3⬘ (as the wild-type
genotype) and 5⬘vic-atgatccgccctcc 3⬘ (as the mutated genotype).
amplification was performed using a 7900ht applied biosystems realtime thermal cycler (applied biosystems, courtaboeuf, france). all
probe/primer sets were designed to function using universal reaction and
cycling conditions.
direct sequencing after pcr was performed for the detection of all
other snps. the primer sequences are available on request. sequencing was
performed on an abi prism genetic analyzer system 9700 (applied
biosystems).
pharmacodynamics. international normalized ratio (inr) was determined using thromborel s (dade behring, marburg, germany).  xxxg750xxx 
coagulant activity was determined by a one-stage assay using factor
vii–deficient plasma (dade behring) and thromborel s.
to evaluate ac pharmacodynamics,  xxxg750xxx  ratio ([ xxxg750xxx 
24 hours after ac intake/ xxxg750xxx  before ac intake] ⫻ 100) and inr
change (ie, [(inr 24 hours after ac intake ⫺ inr before ac intake/inr
before ac intake) ⫻ 100]) were chosen to evaluate ac pharmacodynamics.
plasmid construction
to study the effect on the promoter activity of the  xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639g⬎a
polymorphism, a 2171-bp fragment containing either the g (wild type) or a
(mutant) allele was initially amplified from genomic dna (isolated from
subjects homozygous either for the g or a allele) with  xxxg2418xxx  specific
primers (5⬘-aggagattggtcagcttaattccat-3⬘ and 5⬘-taatcatctggcatcctggc-3⬘). finally, a 1768-bp subfragment (⫺1756,
⫺12; the nucleotides are numbered from the a in the atg initiating
translation) was obtained from the first pcr product with primers
incorporating nhei and hindiii restriction sites (5⬘-ggaggagctagcaggagaggg-3⬘ and 5⬘-tatctcaagcttccgcccg-3⬘).
the 2 purified pcr products (eg, one containing the g allele; the other,
the a allele) were then digested with hindiii and nhei and cloned in the
 xxxg2041xxx  basic vector, upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene
(promega, charbonière, france). the pcr reactions were run with
proofreading pfuturbo dna polymerase (stratagene, charbonière, france).
all constructs were checked by direct sequencing on an abi prism 7700
genetic analyser sequencer (applied biosystems). the p␣glob-rl plasmid, a gift of dr y. morel, contains a promoter derived from the proximal
part of the human ␣-globin promoter upstream of the renillla luciferase
reporter gene (used as internal control),18 which allows control of the
transfection efficiency.
cell culture and transfection
hepg2 cells were grown in 50% dulbecco modified eagle medium
(dmem) and 50% hamf12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs), 200 u/ml penicillin, and 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx  in a
5%-humidified atmosphere. transfection experiments were performed in
hepg2 cells using the calcium-phosphate method. briefly, the day prior to
the transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded (2 ⫻ 105 in 12-well
plates) into the usual culture medium. for each series of transfections, 1 ␮g
 xxxg2041xxx  basic plasmid, containing either the  xxxg2418xxx  wild-type or mutated
promoter construct, and 100 ng p␣glob-rl plasmid were added to 31 ␮l
2-m cacl2 and mixed with an equal volume of 2 ⫻ hbs (hepes
[n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n⬘-2-ethanesulfonic acid]–buffered saline)
buffer. after a 20-minute incubation, 500 ␮l of this mixture was added to
each well containing 2 ml media. the media was changed 4 hours after
transfection. the luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase
(firefly and renilla) assay kit (promega) 48 hours later, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. results of wild-type and mutant constructs
were analyzed by expressing the ratio of the 2 luciferase activities. renilla
luciferase activity was used to normalize the transfection efficiency in all
culture dishes. each assay was repeated in 4 independent experiments
including 6 replicates for the 2 constructs.

statistics
one-way analysis of variance (anova) with dunnett post test was
performed using graphpad prism version 4.00 for windows (graphpad
software, san diego, ca). allele frequencies were estimated by gene
counting. departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium was tested by a chi2
test with 1 degree of freedom (df). anova analysis was first performed to
test for the association of each  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism with ac response
and then followed by a haplotype-based association analysis to take into
account the simultaneous information of all  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms.
linkage disequilibrium (ld) and haplotype analyses were performed
by use of the thesias software (http://ecgene.net/genecanvas/modules/
mydownloads/singlefile.php?cid ⫽ 1&lid ⫽ 4) based on the sem algorithm.19 this method allows the estimation of haplotype frequencies and
phenotypic means according to the carried haplotypes under the assumption
of additive haplotypic effects. phenotypic changes, expressed as a percentage compared with baseline values, before ac intake were reported with
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. finally, in order to test
whether the cyp2c9*3 allele previously shown to be associated with factor
vii variability could interact or act additively with  xxxg2418xxx  snps,
interaction was investigated though multiple regression analysis by introducing genotype ⫻ genotype interaction terms in the regression model.

results
allele frequencies of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene among 222
healthy volunteers

allele frequencies of the 7 snps studied are reported in table 1. no
significant deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium was observed for any polymorphism (p ⬎ .05). the observed frequencies
of minor alleles ranged from 0.21 to 0.42, except for the ⫺1877a⬎g
that appears with a lower frequency (0.02).
effect of  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes on ac pharmacodynamic response

all polymorphisms studied were strongly associated with the factor
vii ratio and inr change (p ⬍ 10⫺4). the  xxxg750xxx  ratio
phenotypic variance explained by genotype ranged from 8% for the
⫺2659g⬎c polymorphism to 37% for the ⫺1639g⬎a polymorphism. corresponding values for inr change ranged from 7% to
30% for the same polymorphisms. the  xxxg750xxx  ratio (figure 1a)
and the inr change (%) (figure 1b) are plotted against  xxxg2418xxx 
genotype (only the ⫺1639 g⬎a snp, which corresponds to the
more informative snp, is shown as detailed in the next paragraph).
the  xxxg750xxx  ratio after ac intake decreased in the following
order for  xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639g⬎a genotype: 70% ⫾ 14 for  xxxg2418xxx 
⫺1639g/g, 56% ⫾ 15 for  xxxg2418xxx  1639g/a, and 35% ⫾ 17 for
 xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639a/a (p ⬍ .01). the same effect was observed for
inr change, with an increase of inr more marked in subjects
carrying the  xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639a allele (12% ⫾ 9 for  xxxg2418xxx 
⫺1639g/g, 21% ⫾ 14 for  xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639g/a, and 42% ⫾ 22
for  xxxg2418xxx  ⫺1639a/a; p ⬍ .01).
 xxxg2418xxx  haplotype analysis

all polymorphisms were in strong ld with each other. in
particular, the 1173c⬎t and ⫺1639g⬎a polymorphisms were in
complete disequilibrium. as a consequence of this ld pattern, 7
haplotypes were inferred, among which 5 appeared with a frequency more than 0.05 and accounted for about 95% of all
chromosomes (table 2).
the rare ⫺1877g allele seemed to be carried out by several
haplotypes with very low frequency (0.007) and is therefore not
depicted in table 2.  xxxg2418xxx  gene haplotypes were highly

and explained 37% of its variability. interestingly, all 3 haplotypes
carrying the ⫺1639a (or the 1173t) allele were associated with
low  xxxg750xxx  ratio levels (⬃ 19%) or higher inr change (⬃ 19%),
while all those carrying the ⫺1639g (or the 1173c) allele were
associated with increased levels of  xxxg750xxx  ratio (⬃ 36%) or
lower inr change (⬃ 5%), suggesting that the data could be compatible
with the sole effect of the ⫺1639g⬎a (or 1173c⬎t) polymorphism.
this hypothesis was not rejected (␹2 ⫽ 2.40 with 5 df, p ⫽ .79). thus,
in subjects with the ⫺1639a, ac has a significantly higher
pharmacologic effect than in subjects with the ⫺1639g.
the same analysis, including inr change as quantitative
variable, led to results similar to those obtained with  xxxg750xxx 
ratio (eg, 30% of variability for  xxxg2418xxx ).
multiple linear regression model

cyp2c9*3 allele was demonstrated in a previous paper12 to
account for 14% of variability in percentage of remaining factor
vii. multiple regression analysis revealed that the cyp2c9*3 and
the ⫺1639g⬎a polymorphisms were independently associated with
ac response and explained up to 50% of the variability in the ac
response. when the subject’s body weight was combined with cyp2c9
and  xxxg2418xxx  snps, an additive effect was observed, increasing the
part of variability explained by these 3 parameters to 54%.
results similar to those obtained with  xxxg750xxx  ratio were
observed when using inr change as the pharmacologic index (eg,
40% of variability when combining subject’s weight with cyp2c9
and  xxxg2418xxx  snps).
in tables 3-4, the combined effects of the cyp2c9 and
 xxxg2418xxx  genotypes are presented and plotted against the  xxxg750xxx

luciferase reporter-gene assays

we have cloned a 1.7-kb fragment of the 5⬘ flanking region of the
 xxxg2418xxx  gene containing either the ⫺1639g or ⫺1639a allele
and placed it upstream of the luciferase gene in the  xxxg2041xxx  basic
vector in order to analyze its transcriptional activity in hepg2. for
normalization of luciferase activity, the p␣glob-rl plasmid containing a promoter encoding renilla luciferase was used. the p␣glob-rl
plasmid was used together with each  xxxg2041xxx  plasmid for cotransfection. there were 2 cotransfections performed, containing either the
⫺1639g and the p␣glob-rl plasmid or the ⫺1639a allele and the
p␣glob-rl plasmid. the level of firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to that of the renilla luciferase activity in each
experiment, and the activity of each promoter construct was similar
to the other promoter construct used in our laboratory. the
percentage of luciferase activity after normalization was similar for
the 2 plasmid constructs (data not shown).

ability of the ac pharmacodynamic response. the design study
included healthy white volunteers, thus allowing the determination
of the genetic component of the pharmacologic response while
permitting adequate control of nongenetic parameters (foods,
drugs, pathologic situations) known to influence the response. the
results of this study demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in
cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  account for about 50% of the variability in
the ac pharmacologic response. a recent publication by d’andrea
et al16 suggested, for the first time, the role of  xxxg2418xxx  genetic
polymorphisms on warfarin dose requirements. our data confirm
the impact of  xxxg2418xxx  genetic variations, taking into account all of
the known frequent polymorphisms listed within the gene (5⬘ utr,
coding region, and the 3⬘ utr) and using haplotype analysis.
the dose of ac is currently adjusted according to the inr but a
large variability in the dose-response relationship exists, which
explains the frequent complications: bleeding or insufficient anticoagulation.2,20-22 as described elsewhere,23 these variations in dose
response may be due partly to differences in pharmacokinetics and
genetic polymorphisms in cyp2c9, as shown by the results of this
and other studies,5,12,22 and are not the only factors involved in
interindividual differences. indeed, ac metabolism is influenced
by a number of pathologic, physiologic, and environmental factors.2,24 in a previous study,12 we have shown that body weight and
one cyp2c9 haplotype accounted for about 19% of the variability
in the anticoagulant effect of ac. to improve and extend these
findings, the  xxxg2418xxx  gene was also studied. our results show that
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype explains 37% of the variability, demonstrating the major role of this gene in the pharmacologic response.
according to the design of our study, the percentage of remaining
 xxxg750xxx  (or  xxxg750xxx  ratio) was the most sensitive parameter for
the measurement of the ac pharmacologic response. however,
similar results were also observed when using inr change as a
phenotypic variable. it is usually determined 48 or 72 hours after
anticoagulant drug intake because the half-lives of other blood

pharmacogenetics of oral anticoagulant

coagulation factors (eg, factors ii, ix, and x) are more than 48
hours (up to 60 hours for factor ii). since the pharmacologic
response was calculated over 24 hours, the association between
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype and the inr change might have been
underestimated.
this is the first study that reports the effect of genetic
polymorphisms of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene by haplotypic analysis in the
variability to the ac response. the htsnps were identified from
data obtained from sequencing of a panel of 47 selected individuals
(http://pga.gs.washington.edu/data/ xxxg2418xxx /welcome.html) in order
to perform haplotype construction, and then to determine the
haplotypic effect on the pharmacodynamic response to ac. as
shown in table 1, the frequencies observed in our population (222
subjects) are similar to those observed in the panel of 47 samples
for all snps, except for the ⫺1877a⬎g mutation (0.02 versus
0.14). this difference could be explained by the genetic heterogeneity between the ethnic groups. further, the association of each snp
individually with the percentage of remaining  xxxg750xxx  and inr
change was tested. these snps are significantly correlated with the
ac response and allowed the identification of 7 major  xxxg2418xxx 
haplotypes (table 2). haplotypic analysis revealed that the
⫺1639g⬎a polymorphism (or the 1173c⬎t polymorphism in
complete association with it) is sufficient to explain all of the
pharmacologic variability (⬃ 37%). it is noteworthy that the
htsnps are currently used as genetic markers (for haplotypic
information) independently of the functional impact. in this case,
the use of matinspector (genomatix software, munich, germany)
has revealed a potential nuclear factor 1 (nf1) binding-site motif
(ttggcca) in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene at position ⫺1639 upstream of
atg initiation codon. nf1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor
known to play an important role in viral and cellular regulation and
is involved in the control of constitutive and inducible gene
expression.25 thus, a possible explanation would be that the
mutation ⫺1639g⬎a modifies a putative binding site for nf1
affecting  xxxg2418xxx  transcription. to test this hypothesis, a luciferase reporter gene assay was performed. our results showed no
difference between the wild-type and the mutant promoter. d’andrea
et al found that the 1173c⬎t intronic mutation, associated with
low-dose requirement of warfarin, did not affect the processing of
 xxxg2418xxx  mrna.16 altogether, these results suggested that a clear
functional snp in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene was not yet identified,
although both snps were linked in the pharmacologic response to
anticoagulant.
the multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the
genetic polymorphisms of cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  strongly modu-

late the pharmacologic response to ac with an additive effect, and,
based upon our previously published data, body weight, cyp2c9,
and  xxxg2418xxx  accounted for about 54% for the variability. the
results concerning these factors will likely have implications not
only for ac but also for other oral anticoagulant treatments such as
warfarin and  xxxd2911xxx ,22,26 which are metabolized by the
same enzymes and have the same targets ( xxxd3522xxx –dependent
enzymes). thus, the inclusion of these parameters in computergenerated algorithms to determine the initial doses of these drugs
after a simple genotyping (the 2 snps described in this study for
ac and the additional cyp2c9*2 for warfarin and  xxxd2911xxx ). our results should be confirmed by prospective clinical
studies including treated patient populations. the knowledge of the
pharmacogenetics of drug metabolism and targets for  xxxd3522xxx 
antagonists raises the possibility of individualizing the initial dose
and, thus, limiting the frequent complications observed with the
use of these drugs.
in conclusion, the joint genotyping of 2 snps (cyp2c9*3 and
⫺1639g⬎a or 1173c⬎t on the  xxxg2418xxx  gene), which is easy
and inexpensive, predicts about 50% of the interindividual variability of the ac pharmacodynamic response, providing the opportunity for safer anticoagulant therapy. for the sake of clarity, a
consensus choice should be made between ⫺1639g⬎a and
1173c⬎t as a definitive tag snp. pharmacogenetic testing could
predict a high risk of overdose among 25% of the population before
initiation of anticoagulation. this would correspond to the subjects
carrying either the  xxxg2418xxx  variant allele (⫺1639a or 1173t) or
the cyp2c9*3 allele. some authors have found a weak effect of
cyp2c9*2 on the dose of ac necessary to provide the expected
anticoagulation.8,20,27 in the current paper, we did not find such a
difference, as did some other authors28 and as discussed in our
previous paper.12 the improvement of coumarinic drug ( xxxd59xxx , warfarin) management is clinically relevant because of the
wide use of these drugs and because of the difficulties encountered
during the development of the novel anticoagulants.
