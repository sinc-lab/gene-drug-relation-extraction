inlllbitor for the treatment of asthma
sally e wenzel and alan k ramada

see also page 873.

objective: to introduce and review  xxxd3554xxx , an orally active 5lipoxygenase inhibitor that represents the first of a new class of
medications to be used in the treatment of asthma.

conclusions:  xxxd3554xxx  represents the first drug of a new treatment
category for asthma, the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors. some people
with asthma may receive considerable benefit, but as it is an entirely
new drug entity,  xxxd3554xxx ' s final place in the hierarchy of asthma
medications remains to be determined.

ann pharmacother 1996;30:858-64.

a medline search (from 1966 to december 1995)
was performed to identify pertinent english-language literature.

data sources:

basic science studies on the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3554xxx , its pathophysiologic effects on asthma, and clinical
efficacy trials were reviewed.

stijdy selecllon:

clinical trials were emphasized. studies from ex
vivo or animal models of pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic
effects were considered for review where no in vivo human data
were available.
data extracllon:

 xxxd3554xxx  ha~ shown the ability to attenuate induced
bronchospasm, produce some degree of bronchodilation, and
provide antiinflammatory or steroid-sparing effects with both single
doses (800 mg) and chronic treatment (400 and 600 mg gid).
 xxxd3554xxx  ha~ been studied in patients requiring daily inhaled betaadrenergic agonist treatment; however, data from pediatric
populations and comparisons with other asthma medications are
limited at this time. adverse effects include dyspepsia and elevated
liver enzymes (incidence -3%). one ca~e ofjaundice has been
reported among the more than 5000 patients treated with  xxxd3554xxx .
there is also some concern for drug interactions with hepatically
cleared medications, such as theophylline.

leukotrienes, formed by the metabolism of arachidonic
acid (figure i) in a variety of cells, are lipid mediators capable of producing the bronchoconstriction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation that characterize asthma. since increased concentrations of leukotrienes (lts) have been found in the plasma, urine, and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with asthma, they
are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of
the disease.  xxxd3554xxx  is a selective and potent inhibitor of
 xxxg147xxx , the first enzyme involved in the metabolic
pathway of  xxxd208xxx , which inhibits the production
of the cysteinyl lts (ltc 4 , ltd 4, and lte4), as well as
ltb 4• thus,  xxxd3554xxx  represents a new therapeutic avenue
for the treatment of asthma. 1,2

pharmacology
the chemical name of  xxxd3554xxx  (formerly a-man) is
n-(l-benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)- xxxd2304xxx . it is a hydroxamic acid derivative, with a molecular weight of
236.30 kda (c n h 12 nz02s, figure 2).  xxxd3554xxx  is a potent
and selective inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx , a 78-kda protein
found in the cytosol, nucleus, and membranes of myeloid
cells. this enzyme is essential in the generation of the lts
thought to be important in the pathophysiology of asthma
and other inflammatory and allergic disorders (figure i).
 xxxd3554xxx  is active following oral administration, and like
the majority of other  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors, inhibits 5lipoxygenase directly. it does not bind to 5-lipoxygenaseactivating protein, the 18-kda transmembrane protein that
likely must combine with the enzyme before lt biosynthesis can begin. l ,2

pharltulcokinetics
 xxxd3554xxx  is well absorbed after oral administration and
studies have demonstrated that peak plasma  xxxd3554xxx  concentrations are dose-proportional. steady-state peak concentrations (mean ± sd) occurring 2 hours after a dose
were 2.22 ± 0.070, 4.60 ± 1.52, and 5.66 ± 1.41llglml after 200, 400, and 600 mg four times daily, respectively.
likewise, the areas under the plasma concentration versus
time curve were proportional to the dose administered.
these were 6.60 ± 1.92llg-hlml for 200 mg, 14.27 ± 4.75
ilg-hlml after the administration of 400 mg, and 18.30 ±
5.10 ilg-hlml following 600 mg. both clearance and mean
volumes of distribution for the various doses were not dependent on dose (table 1).3
no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of
 xxxd3554xxx  have been observed between normal volunteers
and patients with asthma. 4 there does appear to be diurnal
variability in the clearance of  xxxd3554xxx , with slightly faster
elimination occurring during the daytime compared with
the evening.s the metabolism of  xxxd3554xxx  indicates that the
drug is primarily eliminated as a glucuronide conjugate. 6"

several studies have examined the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitory activity of  xxxd3554xxx .s,li.14 typically, ltb 4 production is reduced by 70% to nearly 100%. production ofltc4,
ltd4, and lte4 is diminished as well. in one study performed in conjunction with a pharmacokinetics evaluation,
measured reductions of ltb 4 production correlated with
plasma  xxxd3554xxx  concentrations. peak plasma  xxxd3554xxx  concentrations were 5.61lglml after administration of 400 mg
four times daily and 6.7 ilg/ml with 600 mg four times
daily. the concentrations produced corresponded to ltb 4
inhibition of 92% and 98%, respectively.s
inhibition of cyclooxygenase has not been observed
with  xxxd3554xxx , as synthesis of thromboxane b2 , a product of
this pathway, is not significantly altered after single doses
of 200-800 mg,u,is further evidence for the selectivity of
 xxxd3554xxx  on  xxxg147xxx , compared with other enzymes,
is available. one investigation demonstrated little or no inhibition of several related enzymes, including platelet 12lipoxygenase, soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase, and sheep seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase. the
concentrations of  xxxd3554xxx  required for 50% inhibition of
ltb 4 production (lc so) from polymorphonuclear leukocytes and whole blood stimulated by calcium ionophore (a
known inducer of lt synthesis) were 0.5 and 0.9 jlm, respectively.13 a similar icso for ex vivo ltb 4 biosynthes~s
by stimulated whole blood, 0.46 ilglml, was calculated iii

clinical trials
induced bronchoconstriction

 xxxd3554xxx  has demonstrated protection from asthmatic responses induced by cold, dry air, exercise, and bronchoconstriction following ingestion of aspirin by aspirin-sensitive asthmatics.'s,'8-2' a modest., but not statistically significant.,
attenuation of allergen-induced early asthmatic responses
(within i h of exposure) has also been observed. in this
model, no effect could be demonstrated on the late response after allergen exposure; however, considerable variability in the responses to both active medication and placebo were observed. 20
 xxxd3554xxx  has been shown to inhibit exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction. twenty-four subjects with asthma (ii
men, 13 women) enrolled in a placebo-controlled, crossover trial received 2 days of treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  600
mg four times daily. minimal bronchodilation was noted
(mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [fev,] 3.49 vs.
3.61 l following treatment, p =0.04); however, significant
protection from exercise-induced bronchospasm following
exercise treadmill tests was observed. the mean maximal
fall in fev, was 28.1 % with placebo compared with 15.6%
on  xxxd3554xxx  (p < 0.0001), representing a 40% inhibition of
the effects induced by exercise.'8
 xxxd3554xxx  also attenuates the asthmatic response induced
by inhalation of cold, dry air. results from a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 13 asthmatic adults showed decreased responsiveness to challenge following a single dose of 800 mg. the responsiveness to cold, dry air was expressed as the interpolated heat
exchange or minute ventilation required to produce a 10%,
15%, and 20% decrease of the subject's fev" recorded as
pdl(fev" pd,sfev" and pdwfev" respectively.  xxxd3554xxx  increased the pdufev, by 47% (p < 0.002), pd,sfev,
by 38% (p < 0.005), and pdwfev, by 26% (p < 0.02). as
verification of  xxxg147xxx  blockade, ex vivo studies
evaluated the inhibition of calcium ionophore-induced production of ltb4 in whole blood. stimulated ltb4 production was reduced significantly, but thromboxane b 2 was
unchanged.'s
similar reductions of bronchoconstriction were obtained
in a study of patients with asthma who were sensitive to
aspirin after ingestion of aspirin. in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, crossover investigation, 8 patients were given  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg four times per day (2.4
gld) for 7 days. although no significant bronchodilation
was observed with  xxxd3554xxx , treatment did inhibit the reduction of fev, after a dose of aspirin (figure 3). with
placebo, aspirin administration reduced the fev, by
18.6%, from 3.35 ± 0.17 to a minimum of 2.72 ± 0.18 l
(mean ± sem). in contrast, during treatment with  xxxd3554xxx 
the fev, decreased by only 4.4%, from 3.41 ± 0.15 to 3.26 ±
0.17 l (p < 0.014,  xxxd3554xxx  vs. placebo). urinary lte4 excretion was reduced and nasal, gastrointestinal, and dermal
symptoms were also prevented with  xxxd3554xxx  therapy.'9 a
follow-up report to this study indicated that  xxxd3554xxx  was
effective in improving nasal lavage lte4 concentrations
after aspirin-challenge (in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics) in
conjunction with the improvement in nasal symptoms. of
interest,  xxxd3554xxx  also decreased concentrations of the specific mast cell mediator, tryptase, in nasal lavage fluid,
suggesting an effect on mast cell activation. 2'

in a single-dose trial 20 ( xxxd3554xxx  800 mg), early and late
asthmatic responses along with lt production were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover trial in 9 adults with atopic asthma. ex vivo production of ltb 4 by calcium ionophore-stimulated whole
blood was almost completely inhibited; however, urinary
lte4 excretion was reduced by only about half. after the
administration of  xxxd3554xxx , inhaled allergen-induced reduction of fev, was modestly, but not significantly, decreased
during the early asthmatic response. the maximum decrease
in fev, was 1.08 ± 0.25 l (mean ± sem) with placebo and
0.83 ± 0.21 l with  xxxd3554xxx  (ns). the decrease of fev,
was thought to be correlated to the reduction in urinary
lte4 excretion (r =0.8). there were no significant changes
with  xxxd3554xxx  in the late asthmatic response or increase in
airway responsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  following allergen.
the effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on bronchial hyperresponsiveness
has not been well-studied. in an investigation of ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness performed in dogs, there was
no difference between  xxxd3554xxx  10 mglkg and placebo in
the increased airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine
after inhalation of ozone. 22 while an obvious limitation of
this study is the use of an animal model, these results along
with those from the allergen challenge study using a single
dose of zileuton20 suggest that the drug may not be effective in improving the bronchial hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma.
clinical efficacy

to date,  xxxd3554xxx  has been evaluated in the treatment of
patients requiring daily inhaled beta-agonists.23-26 improved
peak flows and spirometry (fev,), and reduced symptoms
and rescue bronchodilator (beta-agonist) requirements are
typical observations.
one hundred thirty-nine asthmatic adults with an fev,
of 40-75% of predicted and not being treated with inhaled
corticosteroids were studied in a randomized, double-blind
comparison of placebo (n =47) versus  xxxd3554xxx  800 mg
twice daily (1.6 gld, n = 46) and 600 mg four times daily
(2.4 gld, n =46).  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg qid treatment resulted in
a 15.6% (0.35 l) increase of fev, (95% confidence interval [el] 0.25 to 0.45 l) within the first hour of administration (p < 0.001 vs. placebo), consistent with results from a
previous study that showed improvement within 0.5 hour

rescue beta-agonist requirements were reduced with  xxxd3554xxx  as was lte4 excretion (both dosages). peak flows

results from two longer clinical trials24-26 both using dosages of 400 and 600 mg four times daily sho~e? consistent observations in patients with asthma requlnng treatment with daily inhalation of a beta-agonist. fev! improved
by approximately 23% (p ~ 0.05 vs. placebo) after the first
doses of 400 and 600 mg, and these improvements were
maintained throughout the course of the studies (3 and 6
mo). in addition, symptoms, rescue beta-agonist requirements, and exacerbations were decreased.  xxxd3554xxx  also reduced the need for oral corticosteroids by 62% compared
with placebo. in a subgroup analysis of patients wi~ more
severe airway obstruction (fev! <50% of predicted) a
marked steroid-sparing effect (80% reduction in corticosteroid use) was seen. 27 other data from a study involving
aspirin-sensitive asthmatics also suggest that  xxxd3554xxx  may
have steroid-sparing effects in this population. 28

antiinflammatory effects at the levels of both mediators
and eosinophils.

adverse effects and drug interactions
trials29,jo

 xxxd3554xxx  has been studied in two
involving bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (bal). the first investigation 29 evaluated 10 subjects sensitive to ragweed
(not necessarily asthmatics) in double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. the patients received  xxxd3554xxx 
600 mg four times daily for 1 week and underwent bronchoscopy with bal before and 24 hours after endobronchial allergen (ragweed) challenge. after a washout
period of at least 3 weeks, repeat challenge and bronchoscopy with bal was performed in the contralateral
lung segment. bal fluid was analyzed for cell counts and
differential, and urinary excretion of lte4 was also measured.  xxxd3554xxx  tended to inhibit the allergen-induced influx of eosinophils 24 hours after the challenge, and significantly reduced urinary lte4 concentrations 4 hours after
the challenge (1234 ± 220 [mean ± sd] vs. 8799 ± 4660
pglmg creatinine for placebo). physiologic parameters
were not evaluated.
a second studyjo examined the effect of 1 week's treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  on 12 patients with nocturnal asthma
and 6 healthy controls in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion. at 1600, bal fluid ltb 4 and sulfidopeptide lt did not differ between the patients and the
controls. however, at 0400, a significant increase was seen
in the patients with nocturnal asthma (ltb 4 13 ± 3 [mean
± sem] vs. 4 ± 1 pg/ml for controls; sulfidopeptide lt 36
± 12 vs. 6 ± 2 pglml for controls), with the ltb 4 concentrations correlating significantly with the nocturnal decrease
in fev! (27.9 ± 4.3%, r =-0.66, p < 0.0001). with  xxxd3554xxx  treatment (600 mg qid for 1 wk), bal fluid ltb4 at
0400 and nocturnal (2300-0700) urinary lte 4 concentrations were reduced (from 13 ± 3 to 8 ± 2 pglml, p =0.01
and 131 ± 25 to 32 ± 5 pg/mg creatinine, p =0.01, respectively) with a trend toward lowered decrease in nocturnal
fev! (from 27.9% ± 4.3% to 19.5% ± 4%, p = 0.086).

headache and infection (no greater than with placebo)
have been reported with chronic (3-6 mo)  xxxd3554xxx  treatment with daily dosages of 1.6 g (400 mg qid) and 2.4 g
(600 mg qid). dyspepsia and moderate-to-severe elevations of  xxxg941xxx  (incidence of 2.3%) were
also observed. 2s only one case of frank jaundice has been
reported in over 5000 patients. treated wi~ zileuto~. this
patient experienced hives and increased liver function test
results after 24 days of treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  800 mg

receiving  xxxd3554xxx  1.6 gld and in 6.5% of patients receiving
2.4 g/d. 23

mains some concern for interactions with other medications eliminated through the liver because  xxxd3554xxx  is also
metabolized via this pathway. in a study31 in healthy, nonsmoking, adult men no effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on indocyanine
green disposition was demonstrated. however, after single
(600 mg) and multiple doses (600 mg qid for 24 d) of  xxxd3554xxx , plasma  xxxd192xxx  clearance was reduced by 20% and
52%, respectively. total urinary recovery of unchanged  xxxd192xxx  and its metabolites was also reduced with  xxxd3554xxx 
exposure. these interactions with  xxxd192xxx  metabolism
indicate potential for interaction across one or several cytochrome p450 gene families; this may suggest the potential for  xxxd3554xxx -induced changes in the disposition of certain drugs.
theophylline, another medication used in the treatment of
asthma and eliminated via the p450 pathway, is susceptible
to numerous drug interactions. thus, it has been suggested
that doses of theophylline be reduced by half on initiation
of  xxxd3554xxx  therapy, with close monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations thereafter. in contrast,  xxxd3554xxx  does
not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin.32

therapeutic issues
comparison with theophylline

only limited comparative data regarding  xxxd3554xxx  and
other medications used in the treatment of asthma are
available. one large trial33 compared  xxxd3554xxx  1.6 gld (400
mg qid),  xxxd3554xxx  2.4 gld (600 mg qid), and theophylline
(target serum concentrations 8-15 ilglml) in randomized,
double-blind, parallel fashion in patients with moderate
asthma. all groups had an improvement in fev1 by approximately 20% and maintained these values throughout
the 13-week treatment period (differences between groups
ns). bronchodilator requirements were reduced by 19-30%
(differences between groups ns), and at least one course
of rescue therapy with oral corticosteroids was required in
10.9%, 10.4%, and 14.5% of patients receiving  xxxd3554xxx 
1.6 gld,  xxxd3554xxx  2.4 gld, and theophylline, respectively.
premature termination from the study due to unspecified
adverse events occurred in 4 of 129 patients receiving the
lower dosage of  xxxd3554xxx , 7 of 124 patients receiving the
higher dosage of  xxxd3554xxx , and 14 of 124 patients who received theophylline. the authors concluded that  xxxd3554xxx  is
as effective as theophylline in the treatment of patients
with moderate asthma, but does not require monitoring of
blood concentrations and the associated costs and inconveniences. however,  xxxd3554xxx  is administered more frequently (4 times daily), which might result in reduced compliance to the prescribed medication regimen.

its use was not entirely clear when approved, clinicians
were able to rely on the european experience to assist in
determining the most appropriate place for prescribing salmeterol to patients with asthma. 34  xxxd3554xxx  represents an
entirely new class of medications for the treatment of asthma and will likely be approved first in the us. it appears to
have bronchoprotective, bronchodilating, and antiinflammatory effects (table 2). as there is somewhat limited experience regarding its use, it will take some time for clinicians to determine the appropriate place of  xxxd3554xxx  in the
management of asthma. however, available studies suggest that it will have a use in the treatment of patients with
asthma who require daily inhaled beta-agonist therapy.
summary

 xxxd3554xxx  represents the first of a new class of medications for the treatment of asthma, and possibly other allergic and inflammatory disorders. in some studies it has
shown the ability to attenuate induced bronchospasm, provide for some degree of bronchodilation, and possess antiinflammatory or steroid-sparing effects. however, few
studies to date have demonstrated improvements of the
bronchial hyperresponsiveness characteristic of asthma.
also, comparisons with other antiasthma agents are limited at this time, as are data from pediatric populations. adverse effects with an incidence greater than placebo have
been dyspepsia and elevated liver enzymes, with one case
of frank jaundice also reported. there is also concern for
drug interactions with hepatically cleared medications,
specifically theophylline (increased serum concentrations).
as  xxxd3554xxx  is an entirely new medication, its place in the
hierarchy of asthma medications, although suggested by
early studies, will continue to be clarified with increased

place in the treatment of asthma

a number of guidelines and algorithms for the treatment
of asthma have been published in the past few years.
while these guidelines are relatively consistent in the approaches to treating the disease, new medications cause
confusion, as their place in these treatment schemes is not
defined. an example of this was the approval of salmeterol, an inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist, in
1994. fortunately, salmeterol had been available in europe
for several years prior to its introduction in the us. although

extracto
ob,jetivo: el primer objetivo de este articulo es introducir y repasar las
actividades de un inhibidor de 5-lipoxigenasa llamado zileut6n, 10 cual
tiene actividad oral y representa una nueva clase de rnedicamentos
usados en el tratamiento del asrna.
fuentes de informacion: artfculos para este repaso fueron
identificados a traves de una btisqueda en medline (1966 ha~ta
diciembre 1995) en idioma ingles.

se seleccionaron aquellos estudios que
describian la farmacocinetica de zileut6n, sus efectos patofisiol6gicos en
el asrna y la eficacia clfnica de este fannaco.

seleccion de estudios:

extraccion de datos: se ie dieron enfasis a las investigaci6nes clinicas.
en casas donde no se obtuvieron estudios en hurnanos, se consideraron
aquellos estudios donde se investigaron los efectos farmacol6gicos y
farmacondimimicos de este fannaco en condiciones ex vivo 0 en
anirnales.

zileut6n puede atenuar el broncospasrno
iducido, produce un cierto grado de broncodilataci6n, tiene efectos
antiinflamatorios y perrnite una reducci6n en la dosificaci6n de los
esteroides usando dosis individuales diarias (800 mg) 0 por medio de
tratamientos cr6nicos (400 y 600 mg 4 veces al dial. zileut6n ha sido
investigado en pacientes que requieren tratamientos diarios con
agonistas beta-adrenergicos. sin embargo, datos en poblaciones
pediatricas y comparaciones con otros medicamentos antiasmaticos son
muy limitados actualmente. los afectos adversos producidos por este
fannaco incluyen dispepsia y elevaciones en las transaminasas
(aproximadamente un 3% de los pacientes). se ha reportado un caso de
ictericia en los mas de 5000 pacientes que se han tratado con zileut6n.
se considera que pueda existir interacci6nes con medicamentos como la
 xxxd3344xxx , que son eliminados por la via hepatica.

sintesis de informacion:

zileut6n, especificamente los inhibidores de 5lipoxigenasa, representa la primera nueva clase de medicamentos usados
en el tratamiento del asma. este fannaco promete dar esperanzas
considerables a algunos asmaticos, pero su representaci6n final en la

jerarqufa de los medicamentos antiasmaticos espera ser determinada ya
que este representa una entidad completamente nueva.

objectif: presenter ie  xxxd3554xxx , un inhibiteur de la  xxxg147xxx ; il
s'agit du premier representant disponible par voie orale d'une nouvelle
classe de medicaments utilises pour traiter i' asthrne.
revue de lrrrerature: une recherche iii' aide de medline (de 1966
ii decembre 1995) a ete realis6e pour identifier la documentation
pertinente de langue anglaise.
selecflon des etudes: les etudes scientifiques de base portant sur la
pharmacocinetique et sur les effets pathophysiologiques du  xxxd3554xxx 
dans i' asthrne de meme que les essais analysant son efficacite clinique
ont ete revises.
selecfion de l'informatlon: les essais cliniques ont ete favorises. les
etudes sur les effets pharmacologiques et pharmacodynarniques realisees
chez des modeles animaux ont ete considerees quand aucune donnee
chez les humains etait disponible.
resume: le  xxxd3554xxx  s'est revele capable d'attenuer un bronchospasme
provoque, de produire un certain degre de bronchodilatation, et d'offrir

des effets anti-inflamrnatoires non steroidiens ii la fois avec une dose
unique (800 mg) ou un traitement chronique (400 et 600 mg qid). le
 xxxd3554xxx  a ete etudie chez des patients qui necessitaient un agoniste betaactrenergique par inhalation; cependanl, les donnees pour la population
pectiatrique et les comparaisons avec d'autres medicaments utilises dans
l'asthrne sont encore limit6es. les effets indesirables comprennent la
dyspepsie et une augmentation des transarninases (chez -3% des
patients). un cas de jaunisse a ete rapport6 parmi les 5000 patients
traites avec ie  xxxd3554xxx . n existe aussi des possibilities d'interactions
medicamenteuses avec les medicaments elimines par ie foie, telle la
theophylline.
conclusions: le  xxxd3554xxx  est ie premier representant d'une nouvelle
classe de medicaments utilises pour traiter i' asthrne, les inhibiteurs
specifiques de la  xxxg147xxx . ii suscite un grand espoir pour
quelques asthrnatiques, mais, comme il s'agit d'un medicament
entierement nouveau, sa place finale dans la hierachie des medications
pour traiter i' asthrne reste ii determiner.
