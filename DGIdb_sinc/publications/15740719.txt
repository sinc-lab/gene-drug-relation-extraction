abstract
we have analyzed binding domains of the  xxxg1642xxx  for barusiban, a highly selective  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist, in comparison
to the combined vasopressin v1a/ xxxg1642xxx  antagonist atosiban and the agonists oxytocin and  xxxd434xxx . for this purpose, chimeric
dgain-in functiont oxytocin/vasopressin v2 receptors were expressed in cos-7 cells. these recombinant receptors have been produced by
transfer of domains from the  xxxg1642xxx  into the related vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  and have already been successfully employed for the
identification of ligand binding domains at the  xxxg1642xxx  (postina, r., kojro, e., fahrenholz, f., 1996. separate agonist and peptide
antagonist binding sites of the  xxxg1642xxx  defined by their transfer into the v2 vasopressin receptor. j. biol. chem. 271, 31593–
31601). in displacement studies with 10 chimeric receptor constructs, the binding profile of barusiban was compared with the binding
profiles of the ligands oxytocin, [arg8]vasopressin,  xxxd434xxx , and atosiban. the binding profiles for the agonists oxytocin and  xxxd434xxx 
were found to be similar. for both agonists, important binding domains were the extracellular n-terminus (=e1) and the extracellular loops
e2 and e3 from the  xxxg1642xxx . for the vasopressin v1a/ xxxg1642xxx  antagonist atosiban, none of the receptor constructs were
able to provide a binding with higher affinity than the starting vasopressin  xxxg231xxx . in contrast, the binding of barusiban was significantly
improved when the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 were transferred from the  xxxg1642xxx  to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx . the binding
domain of barusiban differs from the binding domain of the agonists and the nonselective  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin that has been used in previous studies. overall, the data supported the concept of a central pocket site within
the  xxxg1642xxx .

1. introduction
oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal nonapeptide hormone.
its major physiological role is to induce contraction of
mammary myoepithelium and uterine smooth muscle. as
one of the strongest uterotonic agents known, oxytocin is
widely used to induce and/or augment labor. its action is

mediated by the g protein coupled  xxxg1642xxx  that is
dramatically upregulated in the myometrium immediately
before parturition (gimpl and fahrenholz, 2001). oxytocin
receptor antagonists are, on the other hand, valuable
substances for the treatment of preterm labor by reducing
myometrial contractions. one such substance is atosiban.
this  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist was shown to reduce the
contraction rate in preterm labor and is now used clinically
for the indication of delaying imminent preterm birth.
however, atosiban suffers from lack of specificity, e.g. it
also binds to the vasopressin  xxxg229xxx  (akerlund et al.,
1999). recently, a much more selective  xxxg1642xxx 

10

antagonist, barusiban, has been developed (nilsson et al.,
2003). barusiban shows several times higher affinity and
potency for the human  xxxg1642xxx  than vasopressin
and any other  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist (pierzynski et
al., 2004).
to understand the function of any receptor at the
molecular level, the corresponding ligand binding domains
need to be identified. in the case of the  xxxg1642xxx ,
the extracellular amino-terminus (postina et al., 1996;
hawtin et al., 2001) and extracellular loop regions (postina
et al., 1996) have been shown to be involved in oxytocin
binding. in particular, arg34 within the amino-terminus of
the receptor is required for high-affinity agonist binding
(wesley et al., 2002). it was suggested by molecular
modelling that the oxytocin binding site is formed by the
upper parts of transmembrane helices 3 to 7 plus the first
and second extracellular loops (fanelli et al., 1999). with
respect to the identification of binding domains for oxytocin
receptor antagonists, a more complex picture has emerged
(elands et al., 1988; postina et al., 1996; breton et al., 2001;
wesley et al., 2002). in studies with chimeric oxytocin/
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  constructs, the competitive peptide
receptor antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9] vasotocin (elands et al., 1988) has been observed to bind at the
transmembrane helices 1, 2, and 7 with a major contribution
to binding affinity by the upper part of helix 7, separate
from the agonist-binding domain (postina et al., 1996). in
contrast, using a iodinated photoreactive analogue of
d(ch2)5[tyr-(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin in a photoaffinity labelling approach, a tripeptide motif in the upper part
of transmembrane domain 3 has been shown to be an
antagonist binding site (breton et al., 2001). previously,
d(ch 2) 5 [tyr-(me) 2,thr 4 ,orn 8,tyr 9]vasotocin has been
widely used as an receptor antagonist. however, it exhibits
substantial vasopressin v1a antagonism (manning et al.,
1995). therefore, the results obtained with this compound
are difficult to interpret in terms of receptor specificity. this
is, for example, demonstrated by the fact that the homologue
tripeptide motif within the vasopressin  xxxg229xxx  has also
been shown to be a binding site for the photoreactive
d(ch 2 ) 5 [tyr-(me) 2 ,thr 4 ,orn 8 ,tyr 9 ]vasotocin analogue
(breton et al., 2001).
this prompted us to evaluate the antagonist binding
domain of the  xxxg1642xxx  using barusiban, a highly
selective  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist. furthermore, we
explored the binding domain of  xxxd434xxx , an agonist with
high stability and a long duration of action (engstrom et al.,
1998). for this purpose, we used a variety of chimeric dgainin functiont oxytocin/vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  constructs
that were transiently expressed in cos cells. these
receptors have been created by transfer of domains from
the  xxxg1642xxx  into the related vasopressin v2
receptor and have already been successfully employed for
the identification of ligand binding domains at the oxytocin
receptor (postina et al., 1996). the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
has been used because it shows 40% overall sequence

identity to the  xxxg1642xxx , but it can strongly
discriminate between the ligands [arg8]vasopressin and
oxytocin; [arg8]vasopressin is bound with nearly 400-fold
higher affinity than oxytocin. in contrast, the oxytocin
receptor binds oxytocin and [arg8]vasopressin with similar
high affinity; oxytocin is bound with only about 7–10-fold
higher affinity than [arg8]vasopressin (gorbulev et al.,
1993; akerlund et al., 1999). it was also investigated to
what extent the introduction of  xxxg1642xxx  domains
into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  changes the affinity for the
following ligands: barusiban, atosiban,  xxxd434xxx , vasopressin, and oxytocin.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
the following substances were supplied by ferring pharmaceuticals a/s (copenhagen): atosiban (tractociler),
barusiban (=fe200440),  xxxd434xxx  (duratocinr), and
the radioligand [3]barusiban ([5-3h- xxxd1794xxx ]2-fe200440).
oxytocin and [arg8]vasopressin were from bachem (switzerland). [3h][arg8]vasopressin was from perkin elmer
life science (mechelen, belgium). all other substances
were supplied by sigma (deisenhofen, germany).
2.2. mutagenesis
the construction of the chimeric oxytocin/vasopressin
v2 receptors and the corresponding expression vectors have
been described (postina et al., 1996). the schemata for the
different receptor chimera are shown in fig. 1b.
2.3. cell culture, transfection, and membrane preparation
cos-7 cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (dmem) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf
serum. subconfluent cos-7 cells were grown in 10 cm petri
dishes and were transfected with the different expression
plasmids by the deae-dextran method. membrane preparations were performed as described elsewhere (ufer et al.,
1995). cell membranes were washed and homogenized in
20 mm hepes, ph 7.4. the protein content of the
membranes was determined by the method of bradford
(bradford, 1976) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
the prepared membranes were used for the radioligand
binding assays.
2.4. radioligand binding assay
saturation and displacement assays were performed
using [3h][arg8]vasopressin or [3h]barusiban as radiolabelled ligand. the composition of the binding buffer
was 50 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 5 mm mgcl2. the membranes
were incubated for 30 min at 308c. bound and free

radioactivity was separated by filtration through whatman
gf/c filters presoaked in filtration buffer (15 mm tris/hcl,
ph 7.5, at 4 8c, 2 mm mgcl2) by using a filtration device
(brandel harvester).
competition experiments were performed for all receptor
constructs. for competition experiments, 5–50 ag of
membrane protein was used (depending on the expression
level of the constructs in cos cells). the amount of
membrane protein in the assay was chosen to bind not more
than 10% of the radiolabel in the test. competition binding
of 3 nm [3h][arg8]vasopressin with unlabelled hormones in
a concentration range from 0.03 nm to 100 am was
performed with barusiban as well as with the ligands
[arg8]vasopressin, oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx , and atosiban. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 am
unlabeled [arg8]vasopressin. k i values were calculated
from the ic50 values using the cheng–prusoff equation:
k i=ic50/(1+[l]/k d). the binding of [3h]barusiban to the
various oxytocin/vasopressin v2 receptors (except for the
 xxxg1642xxx ) was of low affinity. so, saturation of the
chimeric receptors with this radioligand could not be
achieved even with high [3h]barusiban concentrations.

under these conditions, competition of [3h][arg8]vasopressin binding with increasing concentrations of unlabeled
ligands was the method of choice.
in the case of the  xxxg1642xxx  and the vasopressin v2
receptor, saturation experiments were performed with
[3h]barusiban and [3h][arg8]vasopressin, respectively. in
saturation experiments, 5–50 ag of membrane protein and
[3h]barusiban or [3h][arg8]vasopressin at concentrations
from 0.1 to 20 nm were used. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 500-fold excess of the corresponding unlabeled ligand barusiban or [arg8]vasopressin.
all binding data were analyzed with nonlinear fitting
programs (graphpad, version 5.5). presentation of the data
was performed with graphpad and sigmaplot, version 8.0
(jandel scientific).

and other oxytocin-related peptides using [3h][arg8]vasopressin as radioligand. the structural formulae of the
different peptides are shown in fig. 1a. the results of the
displacement experiments are demonstrated in table 1 and
fig. 2. saturation experiments using [3h][arg8]vasopressin
and [3h]barusiban as radioligand verified the data calculated
from competition experiments. saturation of [3h][arg8]vasopressin binding to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  yielded a
k d value of 0.8f0.2 nm, in good agreement with the data
obtained from competition experiments (k i=0.6f0.1 nm,
see table 1). for the  xxxg1642xxx , the calculated k d
with [3h]barusiban was 0.94f0.15 nm, in agreement with
the data obtained from competition experiments (k i=0.8f
0.2 nm, see table 1).
as expected, the ligand [arg8]vasopressin revealed highaffinity binding to all of the receptor constructs. only the
chimeric receptors e123 and e1234 showed slightly less
affinity to [arg8]vasopressin. oxytocin bound with significantly higher affinity to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  when
the extracellular amino-terminal domain of the oxytocin
receptor (=e1) had been introduced into the vasopressin v2
receptor. the additional transfer of extracellular domain 3
(i.e. receptors e13, e123, and e1234) further increased the
affinity to oxytocin about 2-fold. thus, the binding behavior
of the ligands [arg8]vasopressin and oxytocin to the
receptor chimeras was confirmed to be as described
previously (postina et al., 1996).
compared with oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx  is an agonist with
about 10-fold lower affinity for the  xxxg1642xxx  but
with significantly higher stability and a longer duration of
action (engstrom et al., 1998). with respect to its affinity to
the receptor constructs,  xxxd434xxx  behaves similarly to
oxytocin.  xxxd434xxx  had also higher affinity to the chimeric
e1 receptor and especially to each of the combinations of e1
with the other extracellular domains, i.e. chimeric receptors
e13, e123, and e1234. notably, the transfer of the
extracellular loop e3 into the e1 chimeric receptor (i.e.

construct e13) led to a 90-fold increase in  xxxd434xxx 
binding. thus, the extracellular loop e3 contributes significantly to the affinity of  xxxd434xxx . the transfer of the
whole e2 loop into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  (construct
e2) did not lead to any increase in affinity for  xxxd434xxx .
atosiban is a combined vasopressin v1a/oxytocin
receptor antagonist in contrast to barusiban. it also shows
substantial affinity for the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx ; the
binding of atosiban to the porcine  xxxg1642xxx  was
only 7-fold higher than to the porcine vasopressin v2
receptor (the corresponding factors for oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx ,
and barusiban are: 440-fold, 800-fold, and 7870-fold,
respectively). none of the domains of the  xxxg1642xxx 
that have been introduced into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
led to a significant improvement in atosiban’s binding
affinity. even the extracellular domains that represent
binding sites for the agonists oxytocin and  xxxd434xxx  did
not show any increased affinity for atosiban.
barusiban, the high-affinity  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist,
discriminates substantially better than other known receptor
antagonists (such as atosiban) between the  xxxg1642xxx 
and the related vasopressin v1a and vasopressin v2 receptors. this was also the case for the porcine oxytocin versus
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  used in this study. barusiban
showed a very low affinity to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
and to most of its chimeric constructs with two notable exceptions: tm12 and tm12e4+. since the  xxxg1642xxx 
antagonist barusiban did neither bind to domain e4+ nor
preferentially bind to tm12e4+ rather than to tm12, one
can conclude that the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of the
 xxxg1642xxx  should directly interact with barusiban.

4. discussion
several approaches have been employed to define ligand
binding sites of the  xxxg1642xxx : site-directed muta-

atosiban ( s ), and barusiban (.) as competitors. data are represented as percentage of bound 3 nm [3h][arg8]vasopressin in the absence of unlabeled hormone.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 am [arg8]vasopressin. the k i values have been calculated from the ic50 values (obtained by curve

genesis, construction of receptor chimeras, photoaffinity
labeling, and three-dimensional molecular modeling (postina et al., 1996; fanelli et al., 1999; breton et al., 2001).
here we used chimeric oxytocin/vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
constructs in displacement studies to identify the binding
domains of various ligands structurally related to oxytocin.
employment of this strategy allowed us to compare the
results with a previous study using the same approach
(postina et al., 1996). among the ligands tested were
barusiban, the most selective  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist

available to date, and  xxxd434xxx , an agonist of high stability
and long duration of action.
the binding profile for oxytocin comprises the extracellular amino-terminus (=e1) and the extracellular loops e2
and e3 of the receptor as previously described (postina et
al., 1996). the contribution of the extracellular amino
terminus for oxytocin binding has also been detected by
other studies (hawtin et al., 2001; wesley et al., 2002).
using site-directed mutagenesis wesley et al. (2002)
identified the amino acid residue r34 within the e1 domain

 xxxg1642xxx  is mainly involved in agonist binding
and can not select between different agonists (hawtin et
al., 2001; wesley et al., 2002). as revealed by the crystal
structure of rhodopsin, the n-terminus of g-protein
coupled receptors could form a compact domain which
overlays the extracellular loops (palczewski et al., 2000;
mirzadegan et al., 2003). glycosylation sites within the nterminal part of the  xxxg1642xxx  are most likely not
involved in agonist binding. glycosylation of the oxytocin
receptor supports efficient receptor trafficking and

as essential for oxytocin binding. in all members of the
neurohypophysial peptide  xxxg1603xxx  family, an
arginyl is conserved at this locus. this residue might be
required for agonist binding throughout this receptor family.
compared with oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx  binds to the
 xxxg1642xxx  with about 10-fold lower affinity
(engstrom et al., 1998) which is in good agreement with
the present results. here, we found that the binding profile
for oxytocin and  xxxd434xxx  appears to be similar (fig. 3).
this supports the assumption that the n-terminus of the

increases cell surface expression (kimura et al., 1997;
wesley et al., 2002).
the binding domains for atosiban could not be evaluated
by the present approach. this may be due to the fact that the
chimeric approach used here offers only a small drange of
measurementst for atosiban; introduction of oxytocin
receptor domains into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  could
only yield a maximum increase in binding affinity of factor
7 (see k i values in table 1) whereas the corresponding
factors for oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx , and barusiban are much
higher, 440, 800, and 7875, respectively.
the binding of barusiban, a highly specific oxytocin
receptor antagonist with up to 100-fold more potency than
atosiban, was improved when the transmembrane domains 1
and 2 were transferred from the  xxxg1642xxx  to the
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx . thus, one can conclude that these
transmembrane domains directly interact with barusiban.
however, the affinity of the receptor construct tm12 to
barusiban is still much lower when compared with
barusiban’s affinity to the  xxxg1642xxx . this demonstrates that other yet unidentified parts of the oxytocin
receptor contribute to the high affinity of barusiban. the
transfer of the  xxxg1642xxx ’s amino terminus into the
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  (construct e1) did not improve
binding of barusiban. thus, barusiban does not interact with
the amino-terminus of the  xxxg1642xxx . together with
the results from other studies one can now firmly conclude
that  xxxg1642xxx  antagonists do not bind to the aminoterminus of the receptor (elands et al., 1988; postina et al.,
1996; hawtin et al., 2001; breton et al., 2001; wesley et al.,
2002).
transmembrane helices offer a mainly hydrophobic
surface for binding contacts. therefore, one could speculate
that hydrophobic parts of barusiban, e.g. the  xxxd1794xxx  at
position 2 interact with the hydrophobic transmembrane
region. the introduction of certain amino acid sequences at
the upper (lipid-extracellular interface) part of transmembrane domain 7 (as present in construct e4+ or tm12e4+)
did not improve the binding of barusiban, as it has been
observed for d(ch2)5[tyr-(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin
(postina et al., 1996). the tripeptide sequence dlvkt at
the upper part of transmembrane domain 3 of the oxytocin
receptor has been identified as an  xxxg1642xxx 
antagonist binding site by a photoaffinity labeling approach
(breton et al., 2001). however, the involvement of the
dlvkt motif for barusiban binding is unlikely, because the
transfer of the e2 domain into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
did not result in increased affinity for barusiban.
overall, on the basis of the receptor models in fig. 3(a
and b), one may propose that all ligands structurally related
to oxytocin/vasopressin can bind within a central receptor
pocket. due to the anti-clockwise arrangement of the
transmembrane helices of the  xxxg1642xxx  (fig. 3b),
amino acid residues that are far apart within the primary
sequence are spatially located close together. different
residues located at the central pocket of the receptor can

15

interact with  xxxg1642xxx  agonists or antagonists. the
agonists form contact sites with both the droof‘ (i.e. amino
terminus) and the extracellular loop domains of the pocket.
obviously, to induce conformational changes of the receptor
that lead to signal transduction, the amino terminus (and
herein a critical arginyl residue) of the  xxxg1642xxx  has
to be contacted by the agonist. in contrast, the oxytocin
receptor antagonists prefer contact sites at the bottom of the
pocket. in particular, barusiban might gain its increased
affinity to the receptor via dipping into the bottom of the
pocket between the transmembrane domains 1 and 2. other
approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis or photoaffinity labeling will be necessary to identify the amino acid
residues interacting with the different ligands. ultimately,
this should help to establish a precise 3d model of the
 xxxg1642xxx  and its binding to  xxxg1642xxx 
agonists and antagonists.
