5. expert opinion

deregulation of the estrogen axis in humans prompts a series of tissue-specific events. in the breast and prostate, alterations in estrogen signalling lead
to genotypic and phenotypic molecular alterations that result in dysplastic
cellular appearance, deregulated cell growth and carcinoma. in bone,
decreased estrogen leads to increased osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, decreased bone mineral density and a significant fracture risk.
 xxxd3402xxx  is a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator that exerts pharmacological activity in the breast, bone and prostate. an intense interest in developing this agent for prostate cancer chemoprevention is based on the
reduction of premalignant and malignant prostate lesions in a transgenic
model of prostate cancer. biological and clinical activity was demonstrated in
phase ii trials by the prevention of progression to prostate cancer in men with
high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and through suppression of
bone turnover biomarkers and increased bone mineral density in men on
androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

prostate cancer remains the most common noncutaneous malignancy and the second leading cause of death from cancer among men in the us, with 232,090 new
cases predicted for 2005 [1].
although the widespread use of  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) for prostate cancer early detection remains controversial, it is presently included as a detection and
monitoring instrument in the practice guidelines of the national comprehensive
cancer network (nccn) [201]. one outcome of psa screening over the past two
decades is that increased numbers of ‘for cause’ biopsies have led to an enhanced
understanding of the pathogenesis of early-stage prostate cancer such that patients
with recognised risk factors for invasive disease are being identified with increasing
success; for example, high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (hgpin) is now
widely accepted as a premalignant lesion that has the potential to progress to invasive prostate adenocarcinoma [2-6]. men with hgpin have an elevated risk of developing prostate cancer independent of changing psa levels [7]. although there is
currently no approved therapy to prevent prostate cancer in high-risk men, there is a
significant effort underway to investigate possible prevention strategies for at-risk
patients to reduce prostate cancer incidence and deaths [8-15]. in addition to testosterone, it is believed that the estrogen pathway may be engaged in multiple steps of
prostate cancer [16-18]. therefore, agents that target the  xxxg730xxx  (er) may

be of value to men, from prostate cancer chemoprevention to
treating complications of prostate cancer.
androgen deprivation therapy (adt), by either bilateral
orchiectomy or treatment with a  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonist, is the cornerstone of treatment for
metastatic prostate cancer [19,20]. in many patients, gnrh
agonists are a routine part of the management of locally
advanced or recurrent nonmetastatic prostate cancer. in addition, the use of gnrh agonists is increasing in prostate cancer
patients of all ages, stages and grades [21]. the intended therapeutic effect of adt is to reduce serum gonadal steroids to
castrate levels. estrogens are produced as a result of aromatisation of testosterone; therefore, men on adt have lower levels
of estrogen than postmenopausal women as they have less testosterone to aromatise [22,23]. as such, adt is associated with
a significant reduction in quality of life through side effects,
including hot flushes, sexual dysfunction, loss of libido, gynaecomastia and osteoporosis [19]. currently, the 20-year relative
survival rate for men with prostate cancer is estimated at
81.1% [24], which is remarkable considering that ∼ 33% of
men died within 5 years when initially diagnosed in
1974 – 1976 [202]. as men are starting adt earlier and are living with prostate cancer longer, safe and effective therapies are
needed for treating the side effects of adt in these patients.
 xxxd3402xxx , a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
(serm), is currently being evaluated in two pivotal phase iii
clinical trials: for a prostate cancer risk reduction effect in
high-risk patients; and for preventing adt-related osteoporosis and consequent bone fractures in prostate cancer patients.
the authors review the clinical development of  xxxd3402xxx  for
these indications, including the preliminary data highlighting
the important differences in the indications, such as different
patient populations, doses, safety and study end points.
2. estrogen
2.1 serms

and male tissue homeostasis

are dynamic tissue regulators
although principally considered to be a female reproductive
hormone, estrogen is bioactive in multiple male tissues
including bone [25], prostate [26] and cardiovascular tissue [27].
estrogens exert their physiological actions through two distinct er subtypes ( xxxg730xxx  and -beta) [28]. er functions in the
nucleus as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor for
which the ligand binding is known to conformationally alter
the structure of the er protein, shifting the dissociation and
recruitment of multiple co-regulator complexes [29].
non-genomic mechanisms are also thought to contribute to
er action [30]. er can activate the transcription of target
genes by binding to specific estrogen response elements in
the promoter of target genes and recruiting co-activators or
corepressors to this complex [31]. a large number of cofactor
proteins are known to influence the activity of ers,
including  xxxg1449xxx  co-activators, such as steroid receptor
co-activator 1 ( xxxg1510xxx ) and  xxxg1601xxx 

294

interacting protein 1 ( xxxg1511xxx ), and the histone acetyltransferases p300/camp response element binding (creb)-binding protein and p300/ xxxg516xxx  associated
factor ( xxxg1227xxx ) [32]. er can also function as a co-activator
itself by tethering to other transcription factors; for example,
those regulating activator protein 1 ( xxxg1222xxx ) or specificity
protein 1 (sp1) sites [33,34].
synthetic serm ligands are structurally diverse, nonsteroidal molecules that elicit or repress er-mediated activity
in a tissue-selective manner [35,36]. there are multiple molecular determinants of er signalling that result in the function of
the serm–er complex, including ligand-specific structural
conformations [37], receptor homo- or heterodimerisation [38],
interactions with cofactors and promoter response elements,
differential expression or activity of er subtypes in target tissues [39] and local steroid metabolism in the target tissue [40].
the unique regulation of target tissues by er suggests that
individual ligands, such as  xxxd3402xxx , may exert their own
distinctive gene transcriptional or biological effect.
2.2 pathophysiology of estrogen in prostate and bone
tissues
2.2.1 estrogen regulates prostate homeostasis

in prostate, a tight balance of sex hormone activities is considered to be essential for normal epithelial proliferation, differentiation and secretory protein regulation [41,42]. although the
prostate is an ‘androgenic’ gland, estrogen is also critically
involved in normal development and carcinogenesis.
although the precise mechanism is not known, considerable
research on the oncogenesis of prostate cancer has implicated
sex hormone deregulation at multiple steps [43-47].
normal prostate contains both  xxxg730xxx  and -beta, localised in
the stromal and basal compartments, respectively [48-50]; however, the actual relationship between expression of  xxxg730xxx  and
-beta with respect to cancer development is not clear. alterations
in the expression of er subtypes are associated with progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. similar to breast
cancer [51], expression of  xxxg731xxx  is decreased relative to  xxxg730xxx  in
high-grade premalignant lesions of prostate [49,50] and prostate cancer [42,46,49,50,52]. epigenetic regulation, principally
due to hypermethylation of cpg dinucleotides in the gene
promoter, is involved in  xxxg731xxx  silencing [46,53]. several lines of
experimental evidence suggest that  xxxg731xxx  controls differentiation and acts as a tumour suppressor in prostate epithelium.
activation [54,55] of  xxxg731xxx  or restored expression in prostate
cancer cells by adenoviral delivery [56] leads to inhibition of
proliferation and decreased invasive properties. moreover,
cells overexpressing  xxxg731xxx  undergo apoptosis [56] and ventral
prostates of  xxxg731xxx  knockout (beta-erko) mice exhibit decreased
apoptosis [57]. although  xxxg731xxx  is thought to have a tumour
suppressive or differentiation effect on the prostate [57,58],
 xxxg730xxx  appears to have a mitogenic effect. estrogenic signalling
through  xxxg730xxx  in wild-type mice is associated with the
induction of carcinoma in situ and cancer of the prostate on

coadministration of testosterone and  xxxd2037xxx -estradiol [59] or
diethylstilbestrol (des) [44,59,60], whereas  xxxg730xxx  knockout
mice (alpha-erko) may develop hyperplasia [59] but not
premalignant lesions or cancer [57,59].
although  xxxg730xxx  appears to be involved in the pathogenesis
of prostate cancer, its exact role and prognostic significance
requires further investigation. the dna binding domains of
 xxxg730xxx  and -beta are almost identical; however, there is divergence
in the activation function (af) domains (af-1 and -2) that
facilitate downstream target events depending on the
three-dimensional conformation of the ligand-bound
receptor [61,62].  xxxg731xxx  requires ligand binding for activation
through af-2. in addition to ligand-dependent activation,
ser118 in the af-1 region of  xxxg730xxx  can be directly phosphorylated by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) family to evoke signalling cascades [63,64]. af-1 and
-2 can activate genes either separately or synergistically.
serms have been shown to have a specific interaction with
 xxxg730xxx  that may result in an improper conformational change
for complete activation and docking of co-activators with
af-2 to activate target genes [62,65]. allosteric interactions
between the receptor and ligand [66] and/or the specific target
estrogen response element and cofactor assembly [67,68] may
confer additional subtle properties for selectivity in a given
cell type.
based on the apparently opposite effects of er subtype
signalling in prostate carcinogenesis, selective modulation of
er subtypes may offer a novel chemoprevention strategy.
moreover, as the complex mechanisms of estrogen-mediated
action in target tissues become known with greater detail and
accuracy, new serms may be developed to improve the
effectiveness of the currently available therapies that are
under investigation.
2.2.2 estrogen

regulates skeletal homeostasis
androgens and estrogens have functional receptors in osteoblasts [69-71] and osteoclasts [72-74], and their effects are
mediated by multiple growth factors and cytokines in the
bone microenvironment [74]. although estrogens and androgens are both vital for bone formation [75,76], estrogen
appears to be the dominant sex hormone in regulating the
male skeleton [77-81]. estrogens control osteoclast activity in
bone, and estrogen deficiency is known to induce bone loss
through upregulating osteoclast formation, which plays a
key role in bone resorption [82].
2.2.3 osteoporosis is prevalent in men with prostate
cancer

gnrh agonists significantly decrease bone mineral density
(bmd) in men with prostate cancer [83-88]. most studies
report 2 – 3% decrease/year in bmd of the hip and spine
during initial therapy. notably, high rates of bone loss are
observed despite concurrent administration of supplemental
calcium and vitamin d and careful exclusion of secondary

causes of osteoporosis [86,88]. bmd continues to decline
steadily during long-term treatment [89,90].
adt also increases fracture risk in men with prostate cancer. a total of three large claims-based studies provide the best
evidence that gnrh agonists increase the risk of clinical fractures [91-93]. in a study of medical claims data from a random
sample of medicare beneficiaries, men receiving gnrh agonist treatment for prostate cancer were more likely to develop
fractures than a control group of men with prostate cancer
who had not received a gnrh agonist (hazard ratio: 1.4;
95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.16 – 1.7; p < 0.001) [94].
after controlling for age, race, geographic location and
comorbidity, gnrh agonist treatment independently predicted fracture risk. in a study of medical claims from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results programme and
medicare database, 19% of the men with prostate cancer who
received adt (bilateral orchiectomies or gnrh agonist)
experienced a fracture compared with 13% of those not
receiving adt (p < 0.001) [92]. treatment duration independently predicted the risk of fracture. in men who received
≥ 9 doses of a gnrh agonist, for example, the relative risk of
any fracture was 1.45 (95% ci: 1.36 – 1.56). increased fracture risk was also observed in a study using a database of medical and pharmacy claims from 16 large companies in the
us [93]. rates of any fracture were 7.91/100 person years at
risk for men who received a gnrh agonist compared with
6.55/100 person years at risk for men who did not receive a
gnrh agonist (relative risk: 1.21; 95% ci: 1.09 – 1.34).
after controlling for other factors, gnrh agonist treatment
was independently associated with fracture risk. age and
comorbidity were also independent risk factors for fractures.
other retrospective studies have consistently reported
high rates of clinical fracture in gnrh agonist-treated men
with prostate cancer [84,95-97]. bilateral orchiectomy is also
associated with increased fracture risk in men with prostate
cancer [98,99]. it is estimated that ∼ 40% of men with localised prostate cancer and the vast majority of men with metastatic disease are being treated with gnrh agonists
annually in the us [21], and patients are starting adt
earlier [21,100] with earlier detection and diagnosis of prostate
cancer. therefore, a prevention strategy for adt-induced
osteoporosis is necessary and should be considered for the
patient beginning therapy on gnrh agonists or other adt.
with the rationale that estrogen plays a pivotal role in male
skeletal homeostasis, and that the serm raloxifene (developed for clinical reduction of bone loss and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women [101,102]) has been shown to
increase bmd in hypogonadal men [89], the continued evaluation of a serm for the prevention of adt-induced
osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer is warranted.

antiestrogen and is currently marketed for advanced breast

cancer in women.  xxxd3402xxx  and other serms have been
widely investigated and some have been used as targeted therapy for breast cancer and osteoporosis indications for
> 20 years (e.g., treatment of breast cancer [103,104], prevention
of breast cancer in high-risk women [103-106], and prevention
and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [102,107,108]),
yet the true potential of a serm in men’s health conditions
has only been recently realised.
serms prevent prostate cancer cell proliferation [109,110]
and induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro [111-113]. in addition to the differential regulation of er subtypes by serms,
experimental evidence is emerging to support the hypothesis
that antiestrogenic activity in prostate may (at least partially)
be mediated through a reduction in  xxxg183xxx 
(ar)-dependent cell growth or ar-mediated transactivational activity. expression of ar in the rat prostate is regulated by both androgens and estrogens [114,115]. recently, the
antiestrogen raloxifene was shown to prevent prostate carcinogenesis in sv40 tag transgenic rats [116]. in the same
study, the prostate cancer prevention effect was associated
with a reduction in circulating testosterone levels and loss of
ar expression.  xxxd3402xxx  and tamoxifen suppress dihydrotestosterone-stimulated ar gene transcriptional activity
when ar is re-expressed in du145 and  xxxg1682xxx  prostate cancer
cells in vitro [117]. tamoxifen also inhibits the growth of the
androgen-dependent cwr22 prostate cancer cell line in
xenografts [118].
with the strong rationale for using a serm to prevent
prostate cancer, preclinical studies were conducted to evaluate
 xxxd3402xxx  in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (tramp) model [119]. tramp mice, expressing the
sv40 t antigen in a prostate-specific manner, normally
develop premalignant lesions and then prostate cancer in
rapid progression [120,121].  xxxd3402xxx  convincingly prevented
the development of hgpin-like lesions in tramp mice,
and prevented or delayed the onset of palpable tumours by
12 weeks. a survival benefit was observed, 100% of the placebo-treated animals had developed tumours and died by
33 weeks of age, compared with 60% of the
 xxxd3402xxx -treated animals that were tumour-free [119]. in the
same study, such effects were similar but less dramatic with
the antiandrogenic agent  xxxd2143xxx . although the exact mechanism is not yet known,  xxxd3402xxx  affects hormone-regulated
pathways to reduce cellular proliferation, induce apoptosis
and delay or prevent the development of cancer in available
preclinical models.
these promising attributes have led to the preferential clinical evaluation of  xxxd3402xxx  as an agent for chemoprevention
in men at high risk for prostate cancer. although a number of
high risk cohorts exist, studies of  xxxd3402xxx  have thus far
focused on men found to have hgpin on prostate biopsy.
hgpin is generally thought to represent a premalignant
abnormality of prostate glands owing to its strong association
with prostate cancer in surgical specimen, and its common
296

morphological and molecular characteristics with the disease.
follow up of men with isolated hgpin on prostate biopsy
suggests a much higher likelihood of prostate cancer
progression than expected among men without hgpin [7].
a phase iia clinical trial evaluated the effect of  xxxd3402xxx 
on hgpin in 21 patients who had a positive needle biopsy
for hgpin within 6 months of enrolment. patients were
administered  xxxd3402xxx  60 mg/day for 4 months, followed
by a repeat biopsy. of the patients who completed the study,
72% (13/18) were found to have no pathological evidence of
hgpin (versus 18% of historical controls) [122]. this study
showed promising results for  xxxd3402xxx  to reduce hgpin
and, therefore, potentially protect against prostate cancer.
however, the limitations of the study were that it was not
controlled, evaluated a small number of patients for a relatively short treatment duration, and that the randomness and
focal nature of prostate biopsies could account for the changes
in hgpin detection over the study period. subsequent studies have evaluated the prostate cancer incidence risk reduction
effect as an end point because assessment of hgpin lesions
for progression may not be accurate by prostate needle biopsy.
3.  xxxd3402xxx 
3.1 pharmacology
3.1.1 chemical

name, structure and properties
 xxxd3402xxx  ( xxxd3402xxx  citrate, figure 1), chemically designated as 2-(p-[(z)-4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl] phenoxy)-n,n-dimethylethylamine citrate [104,123], is a
chlorinated derivative of the nonsteroidal triphenylethylene
antiestrogen tamoxifen. an off-white powder, it is slightly soluble in water (0.63 mg/ml at 37°c) and has a pka of 8.0. the
molecular weight of  xxxd3402xxx  citrate is 598.1.
3.1.2 distribution

and metabolism
the in vitro protein binding of [14c]-labelled  xxxd3402xxx  in
serum was determined in rat, dog, primate, and humans showing extensive (98.6 – 99.8%) serum protein binding across all
of the species in a concentration-independent manner from 10
to 5000 ng/ml [123]. the binding of  xxxd3402xxx  to serum proteins in rat was slightly but significantly (p < 0.05) lower than
that observed in dog, primate and humans. although the protein binding is still very high in rat, the ∼ 8-fold increase in the
unbound fraction relative to dog, primate and human may
explain subtle differences in the tissue distribution and
pharmacokinetics observed between species. additional
in vitro binding studies revealed that  xxxd3402xxx  is primarily
bound to albumin (92%) with 2 and 6% bound to alpha1-acid
glycoprotein and  xxxg836xxx -globulin, respectively, in the serum [124].
metabolism and disposition studies indicate that  xxxd3402xxx 
is extensively metabolised, resulting in several bioactive metabolites that can produce hormonal effects resembling
unchanged  xxxd3402xxx  [123]. the only significant primary
metabolites in humans are n-demethyltoremifene (ndmt,

an active metabolite) and  xxxd2798xxx 
(tor iii) [125,126].  xxxg590xxx  (cyp3a4) is the
major enzyme responsible for the formation of ndmt. the
steady-state concentration of ndmt is increased relative to
 xxxd3402xxx , probably as a result of the slower clearance and
longer elimination half-life of the metabolite. in rats, > 70% of
 xxxd3402xxx  or its metabolites is excreted in the faeces following
oral administration [127]. first-pass metabolism was species
dependent.  xxxd3402xxx  was subject to significant first-pass
effect in rats, with ∼ 42% absolute oral bioavailability. in contrast, the concentration of the parent drug in the serum of
dogs following oral and intravenous administration indicated
only a slight first pass effect with a bioavailability of ∼ 83%.
generally,  xxxd3402xxx  metabolites are excreted primarily in the
faeces following enterohepatic recirculation across the species;
only ∼ 10% are excreted in the urine.
3.2 clinical

development of  xxxd3402xxx 

3.2.1 pharmacokinetics

the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3402xxx  are reviewed
elsewhere [128-132].  xxxd3402xxx  is estimated to be completely
absorbed after oral administration, with no apparent first-pass
metabolism in humans [128]. peak concentrations (cmax) in
serum are achieved ≤ ∼ 3 h after a single oral dose, with a
mean elimination half-life of 4 – 5 days.  xxxd3402xxx  exhibits
linear pharmacokinetics in relation to dose. over the dose
range of 11 – 680 mg, cmax and area under the curve (auc)
are dose proportional, and time to maximum concentration
(tmax) and half-life are dose independent. repeated dosing
does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3402xxx .
after 5 days of once-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic parameters are equivalent to those observed after a single dose. the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3402xxx  in females with cancer have
also been reported [133-135].
3.2.2 food

effects and other pharmacokinetic studies
in a trial that evaluated the effect of a high-fat meal on the
pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3402xxx , the tmax was
delayed significantly by the consumption of food. however,
the cmax and exposure (auc) were not changed. the

pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3402xxx  are not significantly affected
by impaired kidney function but impaired liver function
reduces its rate of elimination [136]. conversely, individuals
with activated microsomal liver activity show an increased rate
of elimination. in a study designed to evaluate the effect of a
potent cyp3a4 inducer on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of  xxxd3402xxx  120 mg, predosing with rifampin 600 mg
reduced the cmax and auc by 55 and 87%, respectively, and
decreased the half-life by 44% [137]. the reduction in cmax
and auc for  xxxd3402xxx  when co-administered with rifampin
suggests that cyp3a4-inducing drugs may reduce the efficacy
of  xxxd3402xxx . in another study,  xxxd3402xxx  600 mg was not
found to interfere with the elimination kinetics of
doxorubicin [138].
3.2.3 clinical

safety
the safety experience with  xxxd3402xxx  is historically obtained
from research and clinical practice in females. the most commonly reported adverse events in females are hot flushes,
sweating, vaginal discharge, nausea, pain, dizziness and
oedema [104,139]. dose-limiting toxicity (i.e., nausea, vomiting
and dizziness) is only observed at doses of ∼ 25- – 40-fold
higher than the daily dose proposed for use in men for prostate cancer chemoprevention (20 mg/day). some of the toxicities associated with  xxxd3402xxx  use are gender specific and not
pertinent to the intended treatment populations for preventing prostate cancer or adt-related osteoporosis; however,
more serious and potentially life-threatening side effects are
known [140].
investigator initiated clinical trials in male prostate cancer
patients have shown that  xxxd3402xxx  ≤ 640 mg q.d. is well tolerated and has produced no serious adverse events or
deaths [141]. furthermore, clinical experience in men who
were at risk of developing or who had developed prostate cancer revealed consistent changes that appear to be (at least
partly) related to the partial er agonist effect of  xxxd3402xxx  or
its metabolites physiologically. taking as a reference the
results of the placebo-controlled phase iib study conducted in
514 men with hgpin [142,143], the main toxicities associated
with  xxxd3402xxx  20 mg were a slight elevation in psa from
baseline over the 12-month treatment period (14.3 versus
5.3% of men; p < 0.05) and modest increases in total testosterone (31.1 versus 1.2% of men; p < 0.05), estradiol (45
versus -3.1% of men; p < 0.05), follicle-stimulating hormone
(24.2 versus 9.6% of men; p < 0.05), and leutenising hormone (40 versus 10.2% of men, p < 0.05). although the total
testosterone level was generally higher in  xxxd3402xxx -treated
groups, most of the men treated with  xxxd3402xxx  remained
within the normal range of total testosterone
(181 – 758 ng/ml). increases in testosterone are also noted for
drugs that alter steroid metabolism, such as the dual
5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride [144].
for  xxxd3402xxx , the altered serum hormone profile may be
mechanistically related to the partial agonist activity in target
tissue. as gynaecomastia was not reported for patients on

 xxxd3402xxx 

 xxxd3402xxx , it is possible that the estrogen-opposing effects of
 xxxd3402xxx  will minimise potential undesired effects of estradiol. the observed increases in total psa were not accompanied by changes in free psa, and the changes are not expected
to interfere with psa screening as outlined in the nccn
clinical practice guidelines in oncology for prostate cancer
early detection [201]. importantly, no statistically or clinically
significant differences were observed between  xxxd3402xxx  and
placebo in benign prostatic hyperplasia indices (digital rectal
exam results or prostate volume). likewise, no differences were
noted in gleason scores between cancers that developed in
placebo or  xxxd3402xxx -treated groups. the numbers of adverse
events, serious adverse events or thromboembolic events have
not differed between the  xxxd3402xxx  and placebo groups [143].
however, patients with a history of thromboembolic disease
were excluded from these studies and, therefore, should not
take  xxxd3402xxx . safety data are not yet available for the proposed 80 mg dose in patients with prostate cancer who are
receiving adt. as the adt-treated patient population is different to men with hgpin, it is possible that the safety profile will also differ. larger trials of a longer duration will be
required before a clear risk–benefit assessment can be made for
 xxxd3402xxx  in the intended male treatment populations. however, with 500 patient years of safety data in men to date,
 xxxd3402xxx  has been relatively safe and well tolerated without
the hot flushes and many other common side effects that are
observed in women.
3.2.4 efficacy:

prostate cancer reduced in high risk men

early hints of clinical activity were documented in the
phase iia study, as evidenced by a reduction in the expected
diagnosis of hgpin on follow-up biopsy of men with known
hgpin who were treated with  xxxd3402xxx . the disease-specific activity and expanded safety (see section 3.2.3) of
 xxxd3402xxx  was further investigated in a multi-centre
phase iib, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of
hgpin using prostate cancer on a follow-up biopsy as a primary end point [143]. the study included 514 cancer-free
patients with affirmed hgpin. as a dose-finding study,
patients were randomly assigned to one of four study groups
(range: 125 – 134 patients/group) representing placebo or
 xxxd3402xxx  20, 40 or 60 mg. repeat biopsy was performed at
6 and 12 months using a ≥ 8-core biopsy. prostate cancer incidence, gleason score and hgpin were evaluated and compared for the  xxxd3402xxx  and placebo groups. in the placebo
group, the risk of men having prostate cancer within 1 year
was 31.2%. results showed the risk of prostate cancer incidence was 24.4% in the  xxxd3402xxx  20-mg treatment
(n = 114) group compared with 31.2% in the placebo
(n = 109) group, representing a 21.8% (p = 0.048; mantel-cox analysis stratified by the study centre) cumulative risk
reduction in prostate cancer. when comparing the overall
reduction in cancer risk for the trial with  xxxd3402xxx  20 mg,
the reduction translates to 6.8 cancers prevented/year/100
high-risk men treated with  xxxd3402xxx . for perspective,
298

tamoxifen (the only approved agent for chemoprevention of
cancer in a high-risk female population in the us) prevents
0.6 cancers/year/100 high-risk patients with breast ductal
carcinoma in situ [103].
when comparing only the 12-month biopsies, subjects
receiving  xxxd3402xxx  20 mg experienced a 48.2% decrease
(p = 0.045; cochran–mantel–haenszel [cmh] analysis stratified by study centre) in prostate cancer incidence compared
with placebo [143]. treatment with  xxxd3402xxx  40 and
60 mg/day caused non-significant reductions in prostate
cancer incidence of 28.2 and 28.3%, respectively.
in addition to risk reduction, an important outcome in this
study was that  xxxd3402xxx  did not increase the number of
high-grade cancers relative to placebo for those participants
who developed cancer on the study. this is in contrast to
another prostate cancer prevention agent finasteride, a type ii
5alpha-reductase inhibitor, which reduced prostate cancer risk
but was associated with an increase in high-grade cancers [15].
based on the promising results of the phase iib study, a
double-blind, randomised, multi-centre phase iii trial of
 xxxd3402xxx  20 mg versus placebo is currently enrolling
1260 patients with a diagnosis of hgpin. the results of this
trial will confirm the efficacy of  xxxd3402xxx  20 mg/day in
preventing invasive prostate cancer in high-risk men.
3.2.5 dose–response effect for prostate cancer
chemoprevention

 xxxd3402xxx  binds to and exerts its activity through tissue-selective regulation of  xxxg730xxx  and -beta.  xxxd3402xxx  binds to er subtypes with similar affinity to raloxifene and tamoxifen [144,145]
with an inhibitory rate constant (ki) of 20.3 (± 0.1) and 15.4
(± 3.1) nm for  xxxg730xxx  and -beta, respectively. luciferase assays have
been utilised to study the transactivation and/or transrepression of  xxxg730xxx  and -beta in vitro when treated with  xxxd3402xxx .
when estrogen-responsive elements – luciferase (ere-luc)
and either  xxxg730xxx  or -beta were co-transfected into hek 293 cells,
 xxxd3402xxx  was a potent antagonist of 17beta-estradiol-stimulated
transactivation of both er subtypes at 1 and 5 µm, respectively [147]. in contrast,  xxxd3402xxx  0.1 µm was a potent antagonist of  xxxg730xxx  (95% inhibition) but not  xxxg731xxx  (20% inhibition;
table 1). thus,  xxxd3402xxx  is a more selective antagonist of the
 xxxg730xxx  subtype (activation of which is implicated in prostate epithelial growth [60]) than  xxxg731xxx  (which is thought to be a negative regulator of prostate epithelial growth [148]). the ability of
low doses of  xxxd3402xxx  to inhibit  xxxg730xxx  (accelerator of prostate
growth) and not block  xxxg731xxx  (inhibitor of prostate growth)
could provide a plausible explanation for the inverse
dose–response effect of  xxxd3402xxx  on prostate cancer incidence that is observed in prostate chemoprevention [143]. this
(tentative) suggestion is not inconsistent with a recent report
that various ligands differentially modulate er transactivation
or transrepression in breast cancer cells, at least partially,
dependent on concentration [149].
other factors should be considered in relation to the

chemoprevention study, including the increased serum estradiol at higher dose levels of  xxxd3402xxx  relative to  xxxd3402xxx 
20 mg in the study, possibly by displacing the hormone from
er in tissues. there is also an increased likelihood that
 xxxd3402xxx  would interfere with the hypothalamic–pituitary
axis at the higher doses to increase secretions of lh and fsh
to stimulate peripheral steroidogenesis.
3.2.6 efficacy:  xxxd3402xxx  increases bmd in men on
gnrh agonists

in a phase ii proof-of-concept study, 46 men receiving
chronic adt were randomly assigned to placebo or
 xxxd3402xxx  20, 40 or 60 mg/day for 6 months [150]. compared with placebo,  xxxd3402xxx  60 mg significantly increased
lumbar spine bmd with a mean 3.5% change from baseline
(p < 0.05) and tended to increase femoral bmd with a 1.1%
change from baseline. in a separate analysis, bone turnover
markers were evaluated after 6 months of therapy with
 xxxd3402xxx  to prevent adt-induced osteoporosis. a significant dose-dependent suppression of bone turnover markers
osteocalcin (-1.3 and 1.5 versus 3% change from baseline for
 xxxd3402xxx  40 and 60 mg versus placebo, respectively;
p < 0.038) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-0.6 versus 2.8% change from baseline for  xxxd3402xxx  60 mg versus
placebo, respectively; p = 0.038) occurred. urinary c-telopeptide (u-ctx), a bone resorption marker, was suppressed
in all of the treatment groups relative to control (-2.1 ± 21
versus 10.1 ± 34.4 mean percentage change from baseline for
 xxxd3402xxx  60 mg versus placebo, respectively; p = 0.038),
providing additional mechanistic support for the prevention
of adt-induced osteoporosis by  xxxd3402xxx . these data provide the first clinical evidence to suggest the benefit of
 xxxd3402xxx  in preventing bone loss associated with adt for
prostate cancer.  xxxd3402xxx  60 mg did not statistically
improve femoral bmd but demonstrated bmd benefits in
the spine and thus  xxxd3402xxx  60 mg was not thought to be
the optimal dose in men on adt.
another randomised study provides further evidence for
efficacy of serms in hypogonadal men. in a 12-month
open-label study, men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer
(n = 48) who were receiving a gnrh agonist were assigned
randomly to raloxifene 60 mg/day or no raloxifene [89]. bmd
of the posteroanterior lumbar spine and proximal femur were
measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. raloxifene

significantly increased bmd of the hip and tended to increase
the bmd of the spine. raloxifene also decreased biochemical
markers of bone turnover.
in a definitive phase iii trial, 1494 men who were taking a
gnrh agonist for advanced prostate cancer are being randomly assigned to either  xxxd3402xxx  80 mg or placebo. major
study outcomes include fracture, bmd, hot flushes and
gynaecomastia. the trial represents the first serm product
for prevention of adt-induced osteoporosis, which includes
fracture data, and is expected to complete in 2007.
4. conclusions

 xxxd3402xxx  is a nonsteroidal serm that acts as an estrogen
antagonist in some tissues and estrogen agonist in others.
overwhelming evidence supports the theory that estrogens
mediate important biological pathways in prostate tissue.
estrogen pathway deregulation in prostate ultimately contributes to adenocarcinoma. results from phase ii clinical
trials in men with precancerous prostate lesions provide clinical support for the ability of  xxxd3402xxx  to reduce the risk of
invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma. these data reflect the
ability of  xxxd3402xxx  to maintain prostate homeostasis and
prevent hyperproliferation of ductal/acinal epithelium, presumably through a modulation of hormonal or growth factor
activity. estrogen is also required for male skeletal homeostasis. in bone, decreased estrogen leads to increased osteoclastogenesis, increased bone resorption, decreased bmd and
osteoporosis. men who receive adt to treat androgen-dependent prostate cancer are at high risk for osteoporosis and fracture.  xxxd3402xxx  mimics estrogen activity in
bone to inhibit osteoclastogenesis and function. clinical
experience shows  xxxd3402xxx  suppresses bone turnover
biomarkers and increases bmd in men treated with adt for
prostate cancer. ongoing pivotal phase iii studies will determine the efficacy and safety of  xxxd3402xxx , including prostate
cancer chemoprevention in high-risk men and prevention of
bone fracture and potentially the other complications
(gynaecomastia and hot flushes) of adt in men with
prostate cancer.

expert opinion

non-specific androgen ablative strategies have remained the
standard for advanced prostate cancer for > 50 years. such
strategies, involving the removal of ligand, result in broad
toxicities and, inevitably, in androgen-independent growth
through promiscuous ligand activity or growth
factor-mediated mechanisms. although androgens have been
the focus of prostate cancer therapy, estrogens are known to
influence prostate growth, differentiation and carcinogenesis.
the use of serms as a therapeutic agent in prostate disease
marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in prostate cancer
therapy. not only do serms allow hormonal therapy without

broad toxicities, they may offer the chance to alter therapeutic
timing, broaden therapeutic targets and, most importantly, to
improve therapeutic efficacy. this truly represents the first
major alteration since the inception of hormonal therapy for
prostate cancer. early observations with  xxxd3402xxx  are
powerful. the agent appears to be uniquely safe and
