review
emerging strategies for exploiting cannabinoid
receptor agonists as medicines
roger g pertwee

medicines that activate cannabinoid cb1 and cb2 receptor are already in the clinic. these are  xxxd2687xxx ® (nabilone), marinol®
( xxxd1943xxx ; d9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and sativex® (d9-tetrahydrocannabinol with cannabidiol). the first two of these medicines can be prescribed to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. marinol® can also be prescribed to stimulate
appetite, while sativex® is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adults with multiple sclerosis and as an
adjunctive analgesic treatment for adult patients with advanced cancer. one challenge now is to identify additional therapeutic
targets for cannabinoid receptor agonists, and a number of potential clinical applications for such agonists are mentioned in
this review. a second challenge is to develop strategies that will improve the efficacy and/or the benefit-to-risk ratio of a
cannabinoid receptor agonist. this review focuses on five strategies that have the potential to meet either or both of these
objectives. these are strategies that involve: (i) targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside the blood-brain barrier; (ii)
targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed by a particular tissue; (iii) targeting up-regulated cannabinoid receptors; (iv)
targeting cannabinoid cb2 receptors; or (v) ‘multi-targeting’. preclinical data that justify additional research directed at
evaluating the clinical importance of each of these strategies are also discussed.

there are at least two types of cannabinoid receptor, cb1 and
cb2, each of which is g protein-coupled. these receptors can
be activated not only by cannabis-derived and synthetic
agonists but also by endogenous cannabinoids produced in
mammalian tissues and often referred to as ‘endocannabinoids’. the first endocannabinoids to be discovered
were n-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-

arachidonoyl glycerol (devane et al., 1992; mechoulam et al.,
1995; sugiura et al., 1995). these can activate both cb1 and
cb2 receptors and are synthesized on demand in response to
elevations of intracellular calcium (reviewed in howlett et al.,
2002; di marzo et al., 2005). other ligands that may be
endocannabinoids have also been identified (reviewed in
pertwee, 2005a). this system of cannabinoid receptors and
endocannabinoids together with the enzymes and processes
responsible for endocannabinoid biosynthesis, cellular uptake
and metabolism constitutes the ‘endocannabinoid system’
(reviewed in howlett et al., 2002; pertwee, 2005b; 2006).
cannabinoid cb1 receptors are located primarily at the terminals of central and peripheral neurons where they mediate
inhibition of ongoing release of various neurotransmitters
that include acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, 5hydroxytryptamine,  xxxd2177xxx , glutamate, daspartate and cholecystokinin (reviewed in howlett et al.,
2002; pertwee and ross, 2002; szabo and schlicker, 2005).
cannabinoid cb2 receptors are expressed mainly by immune
cells. when activated, they too can affect the release of chemical messengers, in this case the secretion of cytokines by
immune cells, and can in addition modulate immune cell
trafficking (ni et al., 2004; xu et al., 2007; zhang et al., 2007;
see walter and stella, 2004; cabral and staab, 2005; pertwee,
2005b for reviews). cb1 receptors are also present in some
non-neuronal cells, including immune cells, and cb2 receptors in some central and peripheral neurons (skaper et al.,
1996; ross et al., 2001; van sickle et al., 2005; wotherspoon

et al., 2008; see onaivi, 2006 for a review). however, the role
of neuronal cb2 receptors has still to be established. as well as
orthosteric site(s), the  xxxg479xxx  possesses one or more
allosteric sites that can be targeted by ligands in a manner
that enhances or inhibits the activation of this receptor by
both exogenously administered and endogenously released
direct agonists (price et al., 2005; adam et al., 2007; horswill
et al., 2007).
the discovery of cannabinoid receptors prompted the

and cb2 receptors can exist in a constitutively active state

also widely used as research tools (figure 1). they include
the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, d9tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-thc) and the endocannabinoid,
anandamide, each of which behaves as a partial agonist at
both cb1 and cb2 receptors (reviewed in howlett et al., 2002;
pertwee, 2005b; 2008a). the other cb1/cb2 receptor agonists
listed in figure 1 all display relatively high cb1 and cb2 efficacy (reviewed in howlett et al., 2002; pertwee, 2005b). these
are the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and the

[r-(+)-win55212].

licensed medicines that target cannabinoid
receptors
unlike cannabis, which has been used as a medicine over
many centuries (reviewed in mechoulam, 1986), individual
cannabinoid receptor agonists made their first entry into
the clinic less than 30 years ago (reviewed in pertwee and
thomas, 2009). the first of these was the cb1/cb2 receptor
agonist, nabilone ( xxxd2687xxx ®), which is a synthetic analogue
of d9-thc and was licensed in 1981 for the suppression of
nausea and vomiting produced by chemotherapy. d9-thc is
also a licensed medicine. it initially entered the clinic as
marinol® ( xxxd1943xxx ), in 1985 as an anti-emetic and in 1992
as an appetite stimulant, for example for aids patients experiencing excessive loss of body weight. in 2005, nabilone and
 xxxd1943xxx  were joined by the cannabis-based medicine,
sativex®. this contains approximately equal amounts of
d9-thc and the non-psychoactive plant cannabinoid, cannabidiol, and is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adults with multiple sclerosis and as an
adjunctive analgesic treatment for adult patients with
advanced cancer. cannabinoid cb1/cb2 receptor agonists also
have a number of potential therapeutic targets (bambico et al.,
2007; rubio-araiz et al., 2008; see izzo and camilleri, 2008;
pertwee, 2008b; pertwee and thomas, 2009 for reviews).
these include the
• relief of pain induced by certain disorders or conditions in
addition to cancer and multiple sclerosis;
• management of some gastrointestinal disorders;
• management of atherosclerosis and of certain other cardiovascular disorders;
• inhibition of angiogenesis and growth of malignant
tumours;
• relief from various symptoms of multiple sclerosis, spinal
cord injury, alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis;
• relief from tics and behavioural problems experienced by
patients with tourette’s syndrome;
• management of anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and brain repair;

399

• management of tardive dyskinesia induced in psychiatric
patients by neuroleptic drugs;
• management of glaucoma, cough and cholestatic pruritus.
cb1/cb2 receptor agonists can of course produce adverse
effects in patients, and many of these are probably caused by
the activation of central cb1 receptors rather than of cb2 or
peripheral cb1 receptors. adverse effects most often observed,
at least in clinical trials with multiple sclerosis patients,
have been dizziness/light-headedness, dry mouth, tiredness/
fatigue, muscle weakness, myalgia (muscle pain) and palpitations (reviewed in pertwee, 2007a). other less frequently
reported side effects of cb1/cb2 agonists include disorientation, feeling of drunkenness, ‘high sensation’, mental clouding and/or altered time perception, impairment of memory
or ability to concentrate, tremor, balance impairment or lack
of coordination, nausea/feeling sick, hypotension, blurred
vision, constipation or diarrhoea, confusion, dysphoria/
depression, disorientation, paranoia and hallucinations
(reviewed in pertwee, 2007a; pertwee and thomas, 2009). it is
possible, however, for patients being treated with a cannabinoid receptor agonist to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio by
downward self-titration of the dose they take (brady et al.,
2004; svendsen et al., 2004; wade et al., 2004). it is also noteworthy that there is evidence that tolerance develops more
readily to some of the unwanted effects of a cb1/cb2 receptor
agonist than to some of its sought-after therapeutic effects.
this comes both from a clinical trial in which multiple sclerosis patients had been repeatedly treated with d9-thc ( xxxd1943xxx ) (svendsen et al., 2004) and from experiments in
which rats had been repeatedly injected with cp55940 (de
vry et al., 2004).
the only cannabinoid receptor antagonist to have been
licensed as a medicine to-date is the cb1 antagonist/inverse
agonist, sr141716a (rimonabant; acompliat®) (després et al.,
2006). this was introduced into european clinics in 2006 for
the management of obesity. adversere actions experienced by
some patients in clinical trials with rimonabant, mainly
during the first few months, included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, arthralgia (pain in a joint), insomnia, influenza, feelings of anxiety and depression (després
et al., 2005; van gaal et al., 2005; 2008). unfortunately, safety
concerns about the adverse effects of rimonabant in patients
taking it as an anti-obesity agent, particularly an increased
incidence of depression and suicidality, recently prompted
the european medicines agency to recommend sales of this
drug to be halted. rimonabant does of course remain an
extremely valuable experimental tool. however, it is likely
that most pharmaceutical companies will be deterred, at least
for the time being, from developing a drug that displays
rimonabant-like  xxxg479xxx   xxxd1422xxx /antagonist
activity for the management of any disorders. in addition to
obesity and type-2 diabetes, these disorders include some that
are discussed in this review and also nicotine dependence,
impaired fertility in some women, stroke, hypotension resulting from endotoxaemic shock triggered by advanced liver
cirrhosis and intestinal hypomotility in paralytic ileus (izzo
and coutts, 2005; le foll and goldberg, 2005; pertwee, 2005a;
di marzo, 2008; pertwee and thomas, 2009). clearly then
there is an urgent need for a new strategy for blocking cb1

receptors that shares the generally acknowledged effectiveness of rimonabant against obesity, type-2 diabetes and associated cardiometabolic risk factors (reviewed in di marzo,
2008) but not its apparent ability to produce signs of anxiety
and marked depression/suicidal ideation in some patients.
possible solutions to this problem include administering a
neutral antagonist because it lacks the cb1  xxxd1422xxx 
activity of rimonabant (reviewed in pertwee 2005b,c), developing a peripherally restricted drug that selectively blocks cb1
receptors expressed outside the brain or an allosteric antagonist that selectively blocks the  xxxg479xxx -mediatedactions
of just one of the endocannabinoids, or applying an adjunctive strategy that exploits synergism between a low dose of a
 xxxg479xxx  antagonist and some other type of anti-obesity
agent.

emerging strategies for targeting cannabinoid
receptors in the clinic
there is currently tremendous interest in the possibility of
developing a second generation of medicines that will activate or block the endocannabinoid system with improved
efficacy and/or selectivity. this interest has been stimulated
both by the successful development of cannabinoid receptor
ligands as medicines and by the likelihood that such compounds have a number of as yet unexploited but significant
clinical applications. no doubt it has also been sparked by the
discovery that one important role of the endocannabinoid
system is to maintain homeostasis in health and disease
(reviewed in pertwee, 2005a). thus, it has been found that
there are certain disorders, including several that are in urgent
need of better therapies, in which the endocannabinoid
system seems to up-regulate in particular cells or tissues
through increased endocannabinoid release, increased expression of cb1 or cb2 receptors and/or an increase in the coupling efficiency of these receptors. this up-regulation appears
to lead in some instances to ‘autoprotection’ through a suppression of unwanted signs and symptoms or even a slowing
of disease progression, and in other instances to ‘autoimpairment’ through the production or exacerbation of undesirable
effects. the ever-growing list of disorders in which the
endocannabinoid system seems to have autoprotective or
autoimpairing roles has provided additional rationale for the
accepted uses of cannabinoid receptor ligands as medicines
and is, in addition, helping to identify or justify new therapeutic uses for such ligands that include the potential therapeutic applications listed in the previous section (licensed
medicines that target cannabinoid receptors).
knowledge gained about the endocannabinoid system has
revealed several potential strategies either for mimicking its
autoprotective effects in patients with improved selectivity or
for enhancing these autoprotective effects in the clinic. some
of these can be termed ‘direct strategies’ because they rely on
the administration of a direct agonist and have in common
the objective of restricting the activation of cannabinoid
receptors by such a ligand as far as possible to subpopulations
of these receptors that, when activated, generate sought-after
rather than unwanted effects. the other strategies can be
british journal of pharmacology (2009) 156 397–411

termed ‘indirect’ because their purpose is to augment soughtafter effects resulting from the endogenous release of
endocannabinoids onto certain of their receptors. these are
strategies that exploit the ability of an ‘indirect agonist’ either
to inhibit the cellular uptake or enzymatic degradation of
endocannabinoids and so delay their removal from their sites
of action or to target the allosteric sites on cb1 receptors in a
manner that will enhance the ability of released endocannabinoids to activate these receptors.
the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of the cellular
uptake or enzymatic degradation of endocannabinoids and,
indeed, of  xxxg479xxx  antagonists was the subject of a recent
review (di marzo, 2008), as were the potential clinical applications both of  xxxg479xxx  allosteric modulators (ross,
2007) and of cb2 receptor inverse agonists (lunn et al., 2008).
consequently, the remainder of this review focuses solely on
potential ‘direct strategies’ for improving the selectivity
and/or efficacy as medicines of cannabinoid receptor agonists.
these are strategies that involve
• targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside the bloodbrain barrier;
• targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed by a particular
tissue;
• targeting up-regulated cannabinoid receptors;
• targeting cannabinoid cb2 receptors;
• ‘multi-targeting’.

targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside
the blood-brain barrier
cb1 and/or cb2 receptors expressed outside the central
nervous system appear to mediate a number of sought-after
effects that include pain relief, amelioration of certain intestinal, cardiovascular and hepatic disorders and inhibition
of cancer cell proliferation and spread (reviewed in pertwee,
2005a). consequently, because many of the unwanted effects
of cannabinoid receptor agonists are probably mediated by
cb1 receptors located within the brain, interest is growing in
the possibility of developing a direct cb1/cb2 cannabinoid
receptor agonist that on the one hand is excluded from much
of the brain and spinal cord because it does not readily cross
the blood-brain barrier but on the other hand still retains an
ability to produce sought-after clinical effects by activating
peripherally located cannabinoid receptors.
preclinical proof of principal for this approach was recently
provided by dziadulewicz et al. (2007) of novartis pharma ag
who have developed a potent, high-efficacy, orally bioavailable
cb1/cb2 receptor agonist that displays both marked antihyperalgesic activity in the seltzer (sciatic nerve partial ligation) rat
model of neuropathic pain and limited brain penetration. that
this compound, naphthalen-1-yl-(4-pentyloxynaphthalen-1yl)methanone, was producing its antihyperalgesic effect by
targeting cb1 receptors outside the blood-brain barrier is supported both by pharmacokinetic data and by the observations
first, that its antihyperalgesic effect was attenuated by the
cb1-selective antagonist, sr141716a, but not by the cb2selective antagonist, sr144528 and second, that it could

rg pertwee

produce this effect without inducing any sign of catalepsy.
more recently, the development of another peripherally
restricted, potent, orally active cb1/cb2 receptor agonist (compound a) was announced by organon/schering plough
(boyce, 2008). this produces antihyperalgesic effects both in a
rat spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain and in the
mouse formalin paw model of inflammatory pain at doses well
below any that cause catalepsy, at least in rats.
another compound that may ameliorate neuropathic pain
mainly by targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside
the blood-brain barrier is ajulemic acid (ct-3), a synthetic
analogue of d8-thc (dyson et al., 2005; mitchell et al., 2005).
more specifically, this compound has been reported to behave
as a potent, high-efficacy cb1 and cb2 receptor agonist and
to penetrate rat brain less readily than d9-thc or r-(+)win55212. it has also been reported to reverse signs of hyperalgesia in the seltzer rat model of neuropathic pain and signs
of inflammatory pain induced in rats by intraplantar injection of freund’s complete adjuvant in a manner that can be
blocked by sr141716a but not by sr144528, and to exhibit
greater potency in these pain models than in inducing effects
such as catalepsy that are thought to require the activation of
central cb1 receptors. in addition, ajulemic acid has been
found to display analgesic efficacy in a randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind cross-over clinical trial performed
with patients with chronic neuropathic pain. however
although significant efficacy was observed for one primary
outcome measure (visual analogue scale score) it was not
observed for another (verbal rating scale score) or, indeed,
when the measured response was mechanical hypersensitivity
to von frey hairs (karst et al., 2003; salim et al., 2005).
reported adverse reactions to ajulemic acid were dry mouth,
tiredness, dizziness, limited power of concentration, sweating
and more pain, suggesting that it did enter the brain in an
amount sufficient to trigger some cb1-mediated side effects.
when considering the merits of developing a peripherally
restricted cannabinoid receptor agonist, it is important to
bear in mind evidence that the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier may increase in some disorders that, for
example, include alzheimer’s disease and parkinson’s disease
(desai et al., 2007). there is, however, another possible strategy for targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed outside the
brain that does not rely on the integrity of the blood-brain
barrier and this is described in next section.

targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed by a
particular tissue
some tissues located outside the brain express cannabinoid
receptors that appear to mediate effects that are mainly beneficial. consequently, another strategy for reducing the
unwanted effects of  xxxg479xxx  agonism might be to limit the
distribution of active concentrations of an administered cannabinoid receptor agonist to one or more tissues of this kind.
one possibility, at least for the relief of some types of pain,
would be to inject a cannabinoid receptor agonist intrathecally
as there is good evidence that activation of cannabinoid cb1
receptors within the spinal cord can induce antinociceptive

401

effects in preclinical models of acute, inflammatory and
neuropathic pain (reviewed in pertwee, 2001; walker and
hohmann, 2005). cb2 receptors within the spinal cord are also
thought to mediate antinociception, for example in animal
models of neuropathic pain. these may be cb2 receptors
expressed by microglial cells or even by neurons. thus, there is
evidence first, that after peripheral nerve injury cb2 receptors
appear on sensory neurons and/or activated microglia in
mouse or rat spinal cord, and second, that cb2 receptors are
expressed by neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (ross
et al., 2001; zhang et al., 2003; walczak et al., 2005; 2006;
wotherspoon et al., 2005). it will be important to establish the
extent to which a cb1 or cb1/cb2 receptor agonist produces
off-target effects in the clinic when given to patients intrathecally at doses that relieve unwanted symptoms.
for the management of symptoms that are generated in
specific regions of the body surface, another possibility would
be to limit the distribution of active concentrations of an
administered cannabinoid receptor agonist to these regions by
applying it directly to the skin, for example by skin patch. thus
there is evidence first, that cannabinoid cb1 and cb2 receptors
are present in the skin, for example in cutaneous nerve fibres,
mast cells, macrophages and epidermal keratinocytes and also
in the epithelial cells of hair follicles, sebocytes and eccrine
sweat glands, and second, that cutaneous cb1 and cb2 receptor
activation produces antinociception in preclinical models of
acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain (ständer et al.,
2005; see pertwee, 2001; fox and bevan, 2005; whiteside et al.,
2007; guindon and hohmann, 2008 for reviews). in addition,
it has been found that pretreatment of human volunteers with
hu-210 by skin patch (50 mmol·l-1) or dermal microdialysis
(5 mmol·l-1) can significantly decrease mechanical and
thermal hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin application to the
skin and the perception of itch induced by topically applied
histamine (dvorak et al., 2003; rukwied et al., 2003). skin
blood flow and neurogenic flare responses to histamine were
also attenuated by hu-210. importantly, no psychological side
effects were detected in response to hu-210 in these experiments. it has also been found that topical administration of the
cb1/cb2 receptor agonist, r-(+)-win55212, to mice can induce
antinociception in the radiant heat tail-flick test at a dose that
does not impair rotarod performance and in a manner that is
susceptible to antagonism by am251 (dogrul et al., 2003;
yesilyurt et al., 2003). similarly, potenzieri et al. (2008) have
found that injection of r-(+)-win55212 into tumour-bearing
hindpaws of mice can induce signs of reduced hyperalgesia
without also producing catalepsy. this antinociceptive effect
could be blocked both by am251 and by the cb2-selective
antagonist, am630.
clearly then, it may well prove possible to relieve the
unwanted symptoms of some disorders and yet avoid major
off-target cb1-mediated effects by administering a cannabinoid cb1 or cb1/cb2 receptor agonist directly into tissues
such as the skin or spinal cord.

partial agonist rather than a full agonist. these would be
disorders that trigger a ‘protective’ up-regulation of subpopulations of cannabinoid cb1 and/or cb2 receptors that can
mediate symptom relief or oppose disease progression. evidence that such ‘protective’ up-regulation occurs has, for
example, been obtained for
• cb1 receptors in the brain in rodent models of stroke (jin
et al., 2000) and temporal lobe epilepsy (wallace et al.,
2003);
• cb1 receptors in the upper intestinal tract in mouse models
of intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea (izzo et al., 2001;
2003; see izzo and camilleri, 2008 for a review);
• cb2 receptors in the upper intestinal tract in a rat model
of lipopolysaccharide-enhanced gastrointestinal transit
(duncan et al., 2008; see izzo and camilleri, 2008 for a
review);
• cb1 receptors in enteric neurons and cb2 receptors in
colonic infiltrated immune cells in mouse models of colitis
(massa et al., 2004; kimball et al., 2006);
• cb1 and cb2 receptors in human hepatocellular carcinoma
tumours, non-hodgkin lymphomas and human prostate
cancer cells (sarfaraz et al., 2005; xu et al., 2006; gustafsson
et al., 2008);
• cb1 and/or cb2 receptors in brain, spinal cord, dorsal root
ganglia and skin in rat or mouse models of neuropathic
pain (siegling et al., 2001; lim et al., 2003; zhang et al.,
2003; walczak et al., 2005; 2006; wotherspoon et al., 2005;
beltramo et al., 2006; mitrirattanakul et al., 2006);
• cb2 receptors in macrophages and t lymphocytes located in
atherosclerotic plaques (steffens et al., 2005);
• cb2 receptors in microglial cells and macrophages in
regions of human post mortem spinal cord affected by
multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (yiangou
et al., 2006) and in the central nervous systems of mice with
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (maresz
et al., 2005).
intriguingly, there is also evidence, first that  xxxg479xxx 
expression in human colorectal tumours is down-regulated
due to methylation of the cb1 promoter, and second that it
might be possible to enhance the ability of a  xxxg479xxx 
agonist to inhibit the growth of these tumours by first boosting  xxxg479xxx  levels in human colorectal tumours with a
demethylating agent (wang et al., 2008).
provided that there is no concomitant increase in the
expression of cb1 or cb2 receptors that mediate adverse
effects, such seemingly ‘protective’ up-regulation should
according to the receptor occupation theory of drug action
improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of a cb1/cb2 receptor agonist
by selectively increasing its potency for producing soughtafter effects while leaving its potency for the production of
unwanted effects unchanged. importantly, up-regulation of
this kind can also augment the size of the maximal response
to a partial agonist while producing little or no increase in
the maximal response to a full agonist. consequently, any
increase in the benefit-to-risk ratio that results from receptor
up-regulation could well be greater when the administered
drug is a partial cb1/cb2 receptor agonist such as d9-thc than
when it is a high-efficacy agonist such as cp55940. support
british journal of pharmacology (2009) 156 397–411

for this hypothesis comes from the finding that an increase in
cb1 expression level in the mouse small intestine was accompanied not only by a leftward shift in the in vivo log
dose–response curve of the  xxxg479xxx  partial agonist,
 xxxd424xxx , for inhibition of intestinal transit but also by an
increase in the size of its maximal effect (izzo et al., 2001).
cp55940, which has higher cb1 efficacy than  xxxd424xxx 
(reviewed in pertwee, 1999), exhibited a potency increase but
no change in its maximal effect. still lacking, however, are
any in vivo human data indicating whether or not the benefitto-risk ratio for the management of any disorder in which
there is an up-regulation of cannabinoid receptors that is both
protective and selective would be significantly higher for a
cb1/cb2 receptor partial agonist than for a full agonist. it
should also be borne in mind that there are certain brain areas
in which cb1 receptors are particularly highly expressed and
that consequently there will most likely be some unwanted
effects that are produced in patients no less effectively by a
low-efficacy  xxxg479xxx  agonist than by a high-efficacy cb1
agonist (gifford et al., 1999; see howlett et al., 2002 for a
review).
it is noteworthy that both d9-thc and a d9-thc-containing
cannabis extract have been reported to be ineffective against
acute pain in human volunteers when administered at doses
that did not produce serious side effects (naef et al., 2003;
roberts et al., 2006; kraft et al., 2008). this finding could
possibly be an indication that the expression level of cannabinoid receptors in these healthy human subjects was not high
enough for a partial agonist such as d9-thc to produce cb1
receptor-mediated analgesia, at least at an acceptable dose. it
would then be consistent with the hypothesis that d9-thc
relieves some types of chronic pain in humans with reasonable selectivity because this is pain that has been caused by
disorders that selectively up-regulate the cannabinoid receptors that mediate this pain relief. as to the ability of d9-thc to
reduce signs of acute pain in some animals, this could possibly be an indication that the expression or coupling efficiency
of cannabinoid receptors capable of mediating relief from this
kind of pain is relatively high in these animals. however, it
could also be that d9-thc appears to be particularly effective
in inducing signs of antinociception in animal models of
acute pain because these models rely on the ability of an
animal to exhibit a motor response to a noxious stimulus.
thus, some species, including rodents, seem to be more sensitive than humans to the motor impairing effects of a cb1
receptor agonist (reviewed in pertwee, 2008a).

targeting cannabinoid cb2 receptors
evidence obtained mainly from experiments with rats or
mice suggests that another strategy for circumventing the
unwanted consequences of cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  activation, for example for the amelioration of some types of pain,
may be to target cb2 receptors. more specifically, it has been
possible to demonstrate that cb2-selective agonists display
antinociceptive activity in well-validated models of acute
pain, persistent inflammatory pain, post-operative pain,
cancer pain and neuropathic pain (reviewed in whiteside
et al., 2007; guindon and hohmann, 2008). that this anti-

strategies for using cannabinoids as medicines
rg pertwee

nociceptive activity is cb2 receptor-mediated is supported by
reports that it can be induced by cb2-selective agonists, that it
is susceptible to antagonism by cb2- but not cb1-selective
antagonists and/or that it can be abolished by genetic deletion of the cb2 receptor but not of the  xxxg479xxx . importantly, it has also been possible to demonstrate that
systemically administered cb2-selective agonists can induce
antinociception in rodents at doses that do not also produce
effects known to result from the activation of central cb1
receptors (reviewed in whiteside et al., 2007; guindon and
hohmann, 2008).
the precise locations of the cb2 receptors that mediate
antinociception in these animal models remain to be established. however there is evidence that these could include
brain areas such as the thalamus as well as skin tissue, dorsal
root ganglion neurons and microglia or neurons in the spinal
cord (jhaveri et al., 2008; yamamoto et al., 2008; see whiteside et al., 2007; guindon and hohmann, 2008 for reviews).
other potential therapeutic targets for cb2-selective agonists include multiple sclerosis (reviewed in pertwee, 2007a;
dittel, 2008), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (kim et al., 2006;
shoemaker et al., 2007), huntington’s disease (reviewed in
sagredo et al., 2007), stroke (zhang et al., 2007; see pacher and
hasko, 2008 for a review), atherosclerosis (reviewed in mach
et al., 2008), gastrointestinal inflammatory states (reviewed in
izzo and camilleri, 2008; wright et al., 2008), chronic liver
diseases (reviewed in mallat et al., 2007; izzo and camilleri,
2008; lotersztajn et al., 2008) and cancer (reviewed in
guzmán, 2003; izzo and camilleri, 2008; wright et al., 2008).
when developing novel cb2-selective agonists and attempting to predict their in vivo efficacies from in vitro data it is
important to bear in mind that some of these compounds
may interact with cb2 receptors in a manner that varies both
with species and with the constitutive activity of these receptors. thus, for example, bingham et al. (2007) found one
such compound, r,s-am1241 [(2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(1methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-methanone], to
behave in vitro as an agonist at human cb2 receptors but as an
 xxxd1422xxx  at mouse and rat cb2 receptors, and yao et al.
(2006) have found that r,s-am1241 switches from producing
agonism to producing inverse agonism at human cb2 receptors in vitro when the constitutive activity of these receptors is
increased, suggesting that this compound may be a ‘protean
agonist’.
it should also be borne in mind that none of the cb2selective agonists that have been developed to date are completely cb2-specific. thus they are all expected to display
cb2-selectively only within a finite dose range and to target
cb1 receptors as well when administered at a dose that lies
above this range. for any particular agonist, the width of its
cb2-selectivity window will of course be affected by the cb1 to
cb2 receptor ratios of the tissues in which sought-after (or
unwanted) effects are induced by cb1 or cb2 receptor activation. it is noteworthy, therefore, that not all tissues express
cb1 and cb2 receptors in equal numbers in health and that
there is also evidence that disparate changes in cb1 and cb2
expression levels may be induced in some cells or tissues
either pathologically or pharmacologically (reviewed in
pertwee, 2005a). consequently, when an agonist that binds
more readily to cb2 receptors is administered to patients, it is

403

likely that the cb2 selectivity of this ligand will not be the
same in all tissues that express both types of cannabinoid
receptor and also that any selectivity will be lost when a
certain dose level is exceeded.

multi-targeting
one other strategy for increasing the benefit-to-risk ratio of a
cb1 or cb1/cb2 receptor agonist could be to rely on its ability
to interact additively or synergistically with another type of
ligand for the production of a sought-after effect. attention
has focused particularly on numerous reports that d9-thc
can interact additively or synergistically with opioid analgesics such as morphine, codeine or fentanyl in the production
of combined cannabinoid cb1 and opioid receptor-mediated
antinociception in mouse, rat, guinea-pig and monkey
models of acute pain (cichewicz and mccarthy, 2003;
cichewicz et al., 2005; tham et al., 2005; williams et al.,
2006; smith et al., 2007; li et al., 2008; see pertwee, 2001;
cichewicz, 2004 for reviews), in the rat formalin paw model
of inflammatory pain (finn et al., 2004) and in a rat model
of arthritic pain (cox et al., 2007). importantly, in some of
these investigations, clear evidence was obtained through
the construction of isobolograms that cannabinoid and
opioid receptor agonists can undergo synergistic rather than
just additive interactions in their production of antinociception (cichewicz and mccarthy, 2003; tham et al., 2005;
cox et al., 2007). other important findings have been first,
that signs of marked analgesia can be induced by coadministering d9-thc and an opioid each at a dose that by
itself is sub-effective, and second that low-dose d9-thc can
restore the efficacy of codeine and morphine at a time when
antinociception in the absence of d9-thc has worn off
(reche et al., 1996; williams et al., 2006). also noteworthy is
the finding that repeated administration of a low-dose combination of d9-thc and morphine to rats can reduce signs of
pain without producing antinociceptive tolerance (smith
et al., 2007). this observation was made in a rat model of
acute pain in which such tolerance was induced when
d9-thc or morphine was administered repeatedly by itself at
an antinociceptive dose.
there is also evidence that combined administration of
cannabis or d9-thc and an opioid can produce beneficial
effects in patients experiencing chronic pain. holdcroft et al.
(1997) found that oral administration of a cannabis extract
significantly reduced the amount of morphine required for
pain relief by a patient with familial mediterranean fever
experiencing chronic relapsing gastrointestinal pain and
inflammation. more recently, narang et al. (2008) carried
out a randomized single-dose, double-blinded, placebocontrolled, crossover trial with d9-thc (marinol®) followed by
an open-label multi-dose extension study. they found that
oral administration of marinol® produced a significant degree
of additional analgesia in 30 patients with chronic noncancer pain who were taking stable doses of opioid analgesics.
sleep quality was also improved by this adjunctive treatment.
side effects most commonly reported in the initial trial were
drowsiness, sleepiness, dizziness and dry mouth. importantly,
the patients in this study preferred d9-thc to placebo in spite

of these side effects. it is noteworthy, however, that although
d9-thc appears to interact synergistically with opioid analgesics in animals models of acute pain, no sign of such an
interaction was detected either in human volunteers subjected to noxious electrical or thermal stimulation of the skin
or to painful digital pressure (naef et al., 2003; roberts et al.,
2006), or in patients experiencing post-operative pain
(seeling et al., 2006). interestingly, however, morphine and
d9-thc, together but not separately, did reduce the affective
response to cutaneous thermal stimulation in one of these
investigations (roberts et al., 2006).
additional research is required to establish the extent to
which cannabinoid and opioid receptor agonists interact
additively or synergistically in man to produce unwanted
effects in addition to those described by narang et al. (2008),
or indeed, to produce sought-after effects in addition to analgesia. in the meantime it is worth noting that there is evidence that cannabinoid receptor agonists may increase
opioid-dependence liability. thus, for example, manzanedo
et al. (2004) have detected additive/synergistic interactions
between r-(+)-win55212 and morphine in mice for the production of signs of reward in the conditioned place preference
paradigm, and ellgren et al. (2007) have found that repeated
pretreatment of rats with d9-thc can augment the acquisition
and maintenance of heroin self-administration behaviour. it
has also been found that repeated d9-thc pretreatment can
enhance heroin-induced stimulation of rat locomotor activity
(singh et al., 2005). however, there is evidence too that after
single administration, r-(+)-win55212 and morphine interact additively/synergistically in rats to depress rearing, groombritish journal of pharmacology (2009) 156 397–411

ing and locomotor activity (finn et al., 2004). for reasons
already given (section on targeting up-regulated cannabinoid
receptors), such a depressant effect on motor function could
explain why d9-thc appears to interact additively or
synergistically with opioids against signs of acute pain in rats
and mice but has so far been found not to undergo an interaction of this kind in human subjects.
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  agonists have also been found to
interact additively or synergistically with certain non-opioid,
non-cannabinoid compounds in the production of antinociception in animal models of acute or inflammatory pain.
more specifically, interactions of this kind have been detected
between d9-thc or the selective  xxxg479xxx  agonist, arachidonylcyclopropylamide (acpa), and nicotine, and also
between r-(+)-win55212 and clonidine, neostigmine,  xxxd383xxx  and cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors (table 1). such
interactions have been detected as well in animal models of
anxiety, depression and emesis (table 2), suggesting that it
might be possible to exploit interactions between  xxxg479xxx  agonists and non-cannabinoids in the clinic not only for
pain relief but also for the management of other unwanted
symptoms. importantly, although the selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-oh-dpat) and d9-thc have been reported to
interact synergistically in rats for the production of an anxiolytic effect (table 2), there are reports too that 8-oh-dpat
can oppose both d9-thc-induced catalepsy in mice (egashira
et al., 2006) and d9-thc-induced memory impairment and
hypothermia in rats (malone and taylor, 2001; inui et al.,
2004).

d9-thc also undergoes additive or synergistic interactions
in mice with nicotine for the production of conditioned place
preference, hypothermia and hypolocomotion (valjent et al.,

in conditioned place preference, self-administration and
working memory paradigms (young et al., 2005; robledo
et al., 2007) and, for the production of catalepsy or hypothermia in mice or rats, with a range of non-cannabinoids that
in addition to opioids, nicotine, and mdma include benzodiazepines, prostaglandins, reserpine and ligands that target
muscarinic cholinoceptors or some types of dopamine,
noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine or  xxxd2177xxx 
receptors as agonists or antagonists (marchese et al., 2003;
review by pertwee, 1992).
intriguingly, one other potential strategy for the management of pain, or of disorders such as epilepsy or stroke, may
be to co-administer a cb1 or cb2 receptor agonist and a selective  xxxg479xxx  antagonist/ xxxd1422xxx  (tables 1 and 2).
the combined administration of such compounds may also
constitute a new effective treatment for chronic liver diseases
(reviewed in mallat et al., 2007; lotersztajn et al., 2008).

combining strategies
consideration should be given to the potential benefits of
combining some of the strategies mentioned in this review.
for the relief of chronic pain, one possible way of reducing

the incidence of unwanted off-target effects would be to
administer a cannabinoid cb1/cb2 receptor agonist transdermally or intrathecally together with a transdermally administered opioid instead of co-administering these drugs orally.
thus, transdermal co-administration of r-(+)-win55212 and
morphine at doses that did not affect rotarod performance has
been found by yesilyurt et al. (2003) to induce significantly
greater and longer-lasting antinociception in a mouse model
of acute pain than that induced by transdermal administration of either compound alone. they also found that intrathecal administration of an ineffective dose of r-(+)-win55212
markedly potentiated the antinociceptive effect of transdermally administered morphine. similarly, cichewicz et al.
(2005) have found the potencies of fentanyl and buprenorphine for the production of antinociception in a guinea-pig
model of acute pain to be greater when either of these opioids
is co-administered transdermally with d9-thc. there may
also be some therapeutic advantage to be gained from administering a single cannabinoid receptor agonist concomitantly
to skin and spinal cord as dogrul et al. (2003) have obtained
evidence for an antinociceptive synergism between transdermally absorbed and intrathecally administered r-(+)win55212 in a mouse model of acute pain. a third possible
way of relieving pain with improved selectivity might be to
target the spinal cord with a cb2-selective agonist rather than
with cb1 or cb1/cb2 receptor agonist. thus, romero-sandoval
and eisenach (2007) have recently reported that some intrathecal doses of the cb1/cb2 receptor agonist, cp55940, that

reduced signs of post-operative hypersensitivity in rats also
induced catalepsy, vocalization and a decrease in exploratory
activity, effects that all appeared to be at least partly
 xxxg479xxx -mediated. in contrast, no such effects on
motor function or vocalization were induced by the
cb2-selective agonist, (2-methyl-1-propyl-1h-indol-3-yl)-1naphthalenylmethanone (jwh-015), when this was injected
intrathecally at doses reducing post-operative hypersensitivity. it has also been found that intrathecal administration of a
cb2-selective agonist [3-(1,1-dimethylbutyl)-6,6,9-trimethyl6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydro-6h-benzo[c]chromene
(jwh-133)]
can produce antinociception in the mouse partial sciatic
nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain (yamamoto et al.,
2008), although not in the rat formalin paw model of inflammatory pain (yoon and choi, 2003). another possibility,
again for pain relief, would be to administer a cb1 agonist
intradermally or intrathecally together with an orally administered cb2-selective agonist. also worth exploring is the
potential benefit of administering a cb2-selective agonist
together with  xxxg479xxx  allosteric enhancer to patients
with disorders that provoke release of endocannabinoids onto
cb1 receptors that then mediate symptom relief.

future directions
the need for clinical research
there is clearly already strong preclinical evidence in support
of the hypothesis that it should be possible to improve the
efficacy and/or benefit-to-risk ratio of a cannabinoid receptor
agonist as a medicine by adopting one or more of the five
strategies described in this review alone or in combination.
the need now is for clinical research in which the effectiveness of each of these strategies is tested in patients. given the
preclinical data described in this review, these strategies
should perhaps be evaluated initially by focusing on patients
with disorders that give rise to chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain. however, in the longer term it will be important to match any disorder that is treatable with a
cannabinoid receptor agonist with the strategy that works
best for that particular disorder. because the consequences of
chronic treatment with a cb2-selective agonist have been
little investigated, it will also be important when evaluating
the strategy of repeatedly administering such an agonist as a
medicine to seek out any serious unwanted effects that it
produces, particularly in patients with disorders that affect
the immune system, for example multiple sclerosis.
there are currently no clinical human data indicating
whether or not the efficacy or benefit-to-risk ratio of a full or
partial cannabinoid receptor agonist increases when it is
given to patients with a disorder that provokes a selective
up-regulation of cannabinoid receptors that may mediate
symptom relief or slow disease progression. consequently as a
first step in evaluating the strategy of targeting up-regulated
cannabinoid receptors in patients with such a disorder, an
assessment should be made of the extent to which there is any
correlation between (i) cannabinoid receptor density in a
tissue in which these receptors mediate a sought-after effect
and (ii) the efficacy/benefit-to-risk ratio of a cannabinoid
receptor agonist. it would also be of interest to monitor canbritish journal of pharmacology (2009) 156 397–411

nabinoid receptor coupling efficiency in an investigation of
this kind and to compare a cannabinoid cb1/cb2 partial
agonist such as thc with a higher efficacy agonist. as to the
disorder that should be investigated in such a project, the
animal data described in this review suggest that this could be
one that gives rise to chronic inflammatory or neuropathic
pain. another possibility would be to focus on some type of
cancer as there is evidence first that cannabinoid receptor
expression is higher in some human cancer cells than in
normal cells and second that cannabinoid receptor agonists
can inhibit human tumour cell growth (sarfaraz et al., 2005;
xu et al., 2006; gustafsson et al., 2008; see guzmán, 2003;
pertwee, 2005a for reviews). if such research does yield positive results, it would justify the development of a diagnostic
test that could use cannabinoid receptor expression level or
coupling efficiency in particular tissues as a biomarker for
selecting patient subpopulations that would benefit most
from treatment with a cb1/cb2 receptor partial agonist.

multi-targeting: what next?
to ensure that the strategy of multi-targeting is fully
exploited, it will be important to seek out any as yet undiscovered interactions between cannabinoid receptor agonists
and other types of ligand that have therapeutic potential. the
possible advantages of multi-targeting by co-administering
more than two compounds should be explored as well. so too
should the likely advantage of multi-targeting with a single
‘multiple ligand’ that possesses two or more actions that interact additively or synergistically in the production of a beneficial effect. one such compound may be a ligand (compound
12) that has been found to behave both as a cb2 receptor
 xxxd1422xxx  and as a trpv1 receptor agonist and that,
because it has these two actions, has been postulated to be a
potential anti-inflammatory agent (appendino et al., 2006).
another compound that may have clinical applications or
serve as a template for a new medicine because it is a multiple
ligand is the plant cannabinoid, d9-tetrahydrocannabivarin.
thus, there is evidence that this compound can both activate
cb2 receptors and block cb1 receptors (reviewed in pertwee,
2008a), a combination of actions that may render it a particularly effective medicine for the treatment chronic liver
diseases or stroke (section on multi-targeting). because
d9-tetrahydrocannabivarin is a  xxxg479xxx  antagonist, it may
share the ability of rimonabant (sr141716a) to enhance
monoamine release in the brain and so, like rimonabant and
am251 (takahashi et al., 2008), also have the potential to
improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor when this is being used to treat affective
disorders. however, any interest in such a therapeutic strategy
is of course likely to be affected by the recent decision to halt
sales of rimonabant because of evidence that it increases the
incidence of depression and suicidality (section on licensed
medicines that target cannabinoid receptors).
to facilitate the exploitation of multi-targeting in the clinic
as fully as possible, it will be important to explore the mechanisms that underlie synergistic interactions between cannabinoid receptor agonists and other types of ligand. one
possible way forward would be to seek out evidence for
functional interactions between cannabinoid and non-

strategies for using cannabinoids as medicines
rg pertwee

cannabinoid receptors that are expressed by the same cells
and then to dissect out any crosstalk between these
co-expressed receptors that results in a synergistic interaction
from any that leads to mutual antagonism. it is noteworthy,
therefore, that there is already evidence for neuronal
co-expression of cb1 receptors with certain non-cannabinoid
receptors that include m-opioid, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1116xxx , dopamine d1,
dopamine d2 and gabab receptors, and for the occurrence of
functional interactions between some of these co-expressed
receptors (hermann et al., 2002; morales et al., 2004; cinar
et al., 2008; see wager-miller et al., 2002 for a review). such
crosstalk may sometimes involve competition between cannabinoid receptors and co-expressed g protein-coupled noncannabinoid receptors for the same signalling pathway(s) and
a resultant switch in the preferred g-protein subtypes of these
receptors, a mechanism that might for example underlie
the functional interactions that have been reported to take
place between co-expressed cb1 and dopamine d2 receptors
(reviewed in wager-miller et al., 2002; pertwee, 2005b). it is
also possible that an ultra-low dose of a  xxxg479xxx  antagonist can oppose cb1 agonist-induced antinociceptive tolerance by preventing an agonist-induced g protein coupling
switch from gi to gs protein (paquette et al., 2007). for compounds that interact synergistically in the production of a
clinically beneficial effect, the extent to which this relies on
other kinds of pharmacodynamic interaction or, indeed, on
interactions that are pharmacokinetic or metabolic in nature
should also be established.

cb1 and cb2 receptor agonists have diverse off-target actions
there is evidence that some cannabinoid cb1 and/or
cb2 receptor agonists have one or more non-cb1, non-cb2
pharmacological targets (reviewed in pertwee, 2008b). this
should be borne in mind when selecting a cannabinoid receptor agonist for use as a pharmacological tool or potential
medicine. thus, cb1/cb2 receptor agonists do not all interact
with the same non-cb1, non-cb2 pharmacological targets and
will therefore most likely differ from each other in the kinds
of effect that they produce at doses/concentrations at which
they activate or block cb1 or cb2 receptors to the same extent.
attracting particular attention at the moment is the manner
in which some cannabinoid receptor ligands interact with
gpr55. more specifically, it has been reported that this
orphan receptor is activated by the cb1-selective agonist,
methanandamide, by the cb2-selective agonist, jwh-015, and
by certain cb1/cb2 receptor agonists that include d9-thc,
hu-210 and anandamide (ryberg et al., 2007; lauckner et al.,
2008; reviewed in pertwee, 2007b). two other cb1/cb2 receptor agonists, cp55940 and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, were
found to activate gpr55 in one of these investigations
(ryberg et al., 2007) but not in another (lauckner et al., 2008).
in addition, it has been found that gpr55 is activated by
one cb1-selective antagonist (am251) but not by another
(am281), and that it is not activated by the cb1/cb2 agonist
r-(+)-win55212 (johns et al., 2007; ryberg et al., 2007; lauckner et al., 2008). there has also been one report, however,
that neither d9-thc, cp55940, hu-210, anandamide nor
2-arachidonoyl glycerol activate gpr55, when the measured
response is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) phos-

407

phorylation (oka et al., 2007). because of these conflicting
pharmacological data, the question of whether gpr55 should
or should not be regarded as a cannabinoid receptor has still
to be resolved, as indeed has the question of what roles this
receptor plays in health or disease.
