abstract hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous disorder
characterised by severe hypoglycaemia due to an
inappropriate oversecretion of insulin. in a personal
series of 175 patients investigated for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia over the last 20 years, we review
clinical presentations, molecular studies and therap. de lonlay (&) á g. touati á d. martin á c. sevin

peutic management of hyperinsulinism. there were 98
neonatal-onset patients, including 86 permanent
hyperinsulinism and 12 transient forms, 68 with
infancy-onset and nine with childhood-onset. hyperammonaemia was found in 12 out of 69 patients
tested, 4 neonates and 8 infants. neonates were clinically more severely aected than infants. diagnosis of
infancy-onset hyperinsulinism was often delayed
because of less profound hypoglycaemia and better
tolerance to hypoglycaemia. neonates required higher
rates of iv glucose than infants to maintain normal
plasma glucose levels (16 mg/kg per min versus 12 mg/
kg per min). only 16% of neonates were diazoxidesensitive compared to 66% of the infants. neonates
with hyperammonaemia or transient hyperinsulinism
were  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive. most neonates were pancreatectomised whereas 65% of the infants were
treated medically. among surgically-treated patients,
47% had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia (31 neonates and 13 infants) and 53% a diuse form of
hyperinsulinism (39 neonates and 11 infants).  xxxd1868xxx -responsiveness in the focal and diuse forms did
not dier in both neonates and infants; it depended
only upon the age of onset of hypoglycaemia. one or
two mutations,  xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx , were found in 41 of
73 neonates who were investigated and in 13/38 infants using polymerase chain reaction-single strand
conformational polymorphism analysis of both genes.
almost all patients with  xxxg19xxx  (38/41) or  xxxg1250xxx  (5/7)
mutations were resistant to  xxxd1868xxx . ten patients
with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome had
a mutation in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (three
neonates and seven infants) after reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of
cdna. no mutation was found by polymerase chain
reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism in

38

the glucokinase gene. eight of nine patients with
childhood onset hyperinsulinism were treated surgically and histological examination con®rmed an
adenoma in each case. conclusion: the clinical severity
of hyperinsulinism varies mainly with age at onset of
hypoglycaemia. the heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism
has major consequences in terms of therapeutic
outcome and genetic counselling.

introduction
hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of
recurrent hypoglycaemia in early infancy [11,17]. the
inappropriate oversecretion of insulin is responsible for
profound hypoglycaemia which requires aggressive
treatment to prevent irreversible brain damage [1, 15,
16, 17, 19, 23,24]. two histopathological lesions, focal
or diuse, are responsible for hyperinsulinism, and
they are related to genetic heterogeneity [13,14]. the
focal lesion is characterised by a focal adenomatous
hyperplasia associated with the loss of the maternal
allele from chromosome 11p15 and a somatic reduction to homozygosity of a paternally inherited mutation in either of the genes encoding the two subunits of
the k+atp channel, the sulphonylurea receptor type 1
( xxxg19xxx , mim 600509) or the inward-rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx , mim 600937) [3,25]. the diffuse lesions are manifested as b-cell hyperfunction in
the whole pancreas and involve the  xxxg19xxx  [9, 10, 11,
20,22] or the  xxxg1250xxx  [12,21] genes in recessively or
more rarely dominantly inherited hyperinsulinism [9],
the glucokinase gene (gk, mim 138079) [8] or other
loci [10] in dominantly inherited hyperinsulinism, and
the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (glud1, mim
13830) in cases in which hyperammonaemia is associated with hyperinsulinism [18, 26,27].
focal and diuse forms of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (mim 601820) can occur in both neonatalonset (hypoglycaemia within the ®rst 3 days of life) and
infancy-onset patients, while childhood-onset hypoglycaemia (after the 1st year of life) is usually due to
adenomas. the therapeutic outcome in patients depends
on distinguishing between these entities because the
therapeutic approach and genetic counselling dier
radically. focal lesions are eectively treated by limited
pancreatic resection [2] while diuse lesions which are
unresponsive to drug or dietary treatment require extensive pancreatectomy with a high risk of diabetes
mellitus [15, 16, 19,23].
we review here the clinical presentation and molecular studies of hyperinsulinism based upon our personal
experience of 175 patients over the past 20 years.

patients and methods
between 1975 and 1999, a total of 175 patients have been investigated for hyperinsulinism at the necker-enfants malades hospital.
of these, 133 patients were referred from french paediatric units
and 42 from six european countries. these patients were born to
171 unrelated families. there were 98 neonates (table1), 68 infants
(table 2) and nine children (table 3).
the diagnostic criteria were fasting and post-prandial hypoglycaemia (table 4) with hyperinsulinaemia (plasma insulin concentrations >10 mu/l), high rates of intravenous glucose (>10
mg/kg per min) required to maintain the blood glucose above 3
mmol/l, and a positive response to the subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of glucagon (plasma glucose concentration
increase by 2 to 3 mmol/l following 0.5 mg glucagon).
the patients were initially treated in local paediatric units and
were referred to our hospital for investigation of hyperinsulinism.
although our approach to the disease has changed with time,
including the more recent developments, our general protocol was
as follows: blood glucose was maintained at 3±6 mmol/l with
appropriate methods including continuous drip feeding, intravenous administration of glucose at high rates (>10 mg/kg per min),
mostly through a central line catheter, and continuous intravenous
administration of glucagon (1±2 mg/day). hyperammonaemia was
checked (retrospectively performed for the last 2 years) and for
familial cases of hypoglycaemia or parental consanguinity.  xxxd1868xxx  treatment (tables1, 2, 3 and 4) was tested in all the patients at
15 mg/kg per day divided into three doses. the criterion of ecacy
was the normalisation of blood glucose (>3 mmol/l) for at least 5
consecutive days, before and after each meal in normally fed patients, after iv glucose and any other medications had been stopped
[24]. octreotide (a long-lasting analogue of somatostatin) has been
systematically tried since 1998, at 5±60 lg/kg per day, divided into
three subcutaneous injections [7]. a leucine-restricted diet was
tested in speci®c patients consisting of 200 mg/kg leucine per meal.
transient forms (<1 month) of neonatal-onset hyperinsulinism
were ruled out (tables1 and 5). transhepatic selective pancreatic
venous catheterisation (tables1, 2 and 3) was performed, under
general anaesthesia, to locate the insulin hypersecretion [5]. samples of venous blood were collected from all regions of the pancreas
for measurements of plasma glucose, insulin and c-peptide. typically in focal hyperinsulinism, plasma insulin and c-peptide concentrations were high in one or several samples from contiguous
areas, with low concentrations in the remaining samples. in diuse
hyperinsulinism, plasma insulin and c-peptide levels were high in
all samples. pancreatic catheterisation was not performed before
the age of 1 month to exclude patients with transient forms, or in
patients with hyperammonaemia who were likely to have diuse
hyperinsulinism [27]. patients who were thought to have focal hyperinsulinism and those who resisted or could not tolerate medical
treatment [2] underwent surgery (tables1, 2, 3 and 5). intraoperative histological examination was mandatory for the ®nal surgical
decision. focal hyperinsulinism was treated by limited pancreatectomy. diuse hyperinsulinism required near-total pancreatectomy; all resected pieces of pancreas were investigated extensively
by conventional microscopic and histomorphometric studies (tables1, 2 and 3) [13,14].
pancreatic dna was analysed for loss of maternal alleles from
the 11p15 region [3,25]. we searched for mutations in the  xxxg19xxx ,
 xxxg1250xxx , glucokinase (gk) or glutamate dehydrogenase (glud1)
genes in leucocytes of the patients and their parents [8, 18, 20,21].
molecular analysis used polymerase chain reaction-single strand
conformational polymorphism to study all  xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx  [6] and
gk exons whereas glud1 gene was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of
cdna.  xxxg19xxx  mutations were searched for in 115 patients and
 xxxg1250xxx  mutations in 92 patients (tables1, 2, 3 and 6). glucokinase
was studied in a limited number of  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive patients
(table6) and glutamate dehydrogenase in patients with hyperammonaemia only (table6).

neonatal-onset hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia
a total of 12 patients with neonatal hyperinsulinism
recovered completely within the 1st month of life. these
transient forms of hyperinsulinism were not due to
gestational diabetes. eight of these patients did not require any treatment, while the other four were sensitive
to  xxxd1868xxx .
neonatal-onset hyperinsulinism persisted after the
1st month of age in the other 86 patients. many of
them were macrosomal at birth and 30% required
caesarian section. almost 50% of the neonates had
seizures as the revealing symptom of hypoglycaemia
(table1). other symptoms were hypotonia, cyanosis,
hypothermia or abnormal movements such as tremor.
hypoglycaemia was detected by routine assay of blood
glucose in 11 cases. the plasma glucose concentration
at time of the ®rst symptoms was often extremely low
(table1). high rates of continuous oral and intravenous glucose were required in all the patients to keep
plasma glucose concentration at 3±6 mmol/l (table1).
some 14 neonates were  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive and were
treated medically. hyperammonaemia was retrospectively found in four of them. the other neonates, the
majority of them, did not respond to  xxxd1868xxx 
treatment (table1). they were also resistant to octreotide when this treatment was tried (n=12). consequently, 70 underwent pancreatic surgery (table4).
among the neonates who were treated surgically, 31
had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia and 39 had
diuse hyperinsulinism (table4). focal and diuse
forms did not dier in revealing symptoms, rates of
continuous glucose administration or diazoxideresponse. the focal lesions were located in the head
(n=12), isthmus (n=4), body (n=6) and tail of the
pancreas (n=8). one last patient had an unusual bifocal lesion located in the pancreatic head and body.
the clinical outcome of the ®rst 52 patients with
neonatal hyperinsulinism has been previously reported.
the dierence between the post-surgical outcome of
focal and diuse hyperinsulinism in 18 additional patients is identical [2].
as shown in table5, there were neither familial
cases nor consanguinity for patients with focal
hyperinsulinism. each focal lesion was linked to a
maternal loss of an 11p15 allele. mutations in  xxxg19xxx 
and  xxxg1250xxx  genes were found in both focal and diuse
hyperinsulinism (tables5 and 6). inherited mutations
were of both parental origin in the diuse cases but
always of paternal origin for patients with a focal
lesion. only one neonate with a detected inherited
 xxxg1250xxx  mutation was  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive [6]. all
neonates with  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx  mutations were
 xxxd1868xxx -resistant. three neonates with hyperam-

44

among the 68 patients with infancy-onset hyperinsulinism, 2 were considered to have a munchausen-byproxy syndrome and 1 had a congenital disorder of
glycosylation [4]. the patients with isolated hyperinsulinism were often macrosomal at birth. more than
50% had seizures as the ®rst symptom of hypoglycaemia; the other symptoms were hypotonia and loss of
consciousness. hypoglycaemia was detected fortuitously in only two cases, but parents remembered that
episodes of paleness or hypotonia had occurred before
the diagnosis was made. most infants had good clinical tolerance of hypoglycaemia during hospitalisation,
suggesting that diagnosis could have been delayed in
many cases. rates of glucose administration to
maintain normal plasma glucose were lower in infancy-onset than in neonatal-onset hypoglycaemic patients (table2) and only 78% of them required
continuous drip feeding. the majority of patients were
 xxxd1868xxx -sensitive, so that 41 were treated medically
and only 24 required surgery. among the operated
patients, 13 had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia (6 in
the head, 3 in the body, 4 in the tail of the pancreas)
and 11 had a diuse hyperinsulinism (table 4). there
was no dierence in the rates of continuous glucose
administration between the unoperated patients, the
patients with focal lesion and those with diuse hyperinsulinism.
eight infants had associated hyperammonaemia
(table4). four of these patients were sensitive to a
leucine-restricted diet. three patients were resistant to
dietetic treatment but were treated with  xxxd1868xxx . the
last patient (patient 6) underwent surgery before the
diagnosis of hyperammonaemia was known, because
of  xxxd1868xxx -unresponsiveness. however the dietetic
treatment had not been tried before surgery, but it
was eective on post-operative residual hypoglycaemia. the histological study of this patient revealed a
diuse form.
 xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx  mutations were found in 13 infancyonset patients, with 5 focal, 6 non operated and only 2
diuse hyperinsulinism (table5). seven patients with
hyperammonaemia had a mutation in the glutamate
dehydrogenase gene. no mutation was found in the
glucokinase gene in 15  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive infants.

children
nine children were investigated for hyperinsulinaemic
hypoglycaemia occurring between 3 and 6 years of
age. the patients were macrosomal at birth (table3).
of these patients, 50% had seizures as the revealing

symptom of hypoglycaemia, but only one required low
rates of continuous oral glucose. four were initially
treated with  xxxd1868xxx  before surgery and only one
was  xxxd1868xxx -resistant. eight underwent a limited
pancreatectomy and post-operative histology con®rmed an adenoma or insulinoma in each case
(table4). the last patient was sensitive to  xxxd1868xxx 
and did not undergo surgery.
one patient had familial hypoglycaemia due to a
mutation in the men1 gene and another had
recklinghausen syndrome. a loss of allele in the 11p15
to 11p13 region was found in one of two other pancreatic samples studied.

discussion
hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous condition with
important dierences related to the age of onset of the
symptoms, the histological form of insulin hypersecretion and the mutations. first, there is a clear difference between hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia
occurring within the ®rst days of life (neonatal-onset),
the 1st year of life (infancy-onset), and that starting
later (childhood-onset). neonatal-onset patients have
more severe clinical features than infancy-onset patients. treatment of hyperinsulinaemic neonates is
dicult, requiring high rates of iv glucose. glucose
must be given via a central venous catheter and often
needs to be associated with continuous intravenous
infusion of glucagon. medical treatments must be tried
once the plasma glucose concentration is under control. however, most neonates do not respond to the
currently known drugs and must undergo pancreatectomy [2]. the management of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is easier in infancy-onset than in neonatalonset patients, as the former are generally sensitive to
medical treatment. hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia
is a condition with several aetiologies and speci®c
causes should be looked for in particular clinical situations.
a minority of patients with neonatal onset is responsive to  xxxd1868xxx ; most of them have a transient
form of hyperinsulinism or they have the syndrome of
hyperinsulinism associated with hyperammonaemia
[18, 26,27]. hyperammonaemia must be routinely
searched for in both neonatal- and infancy-onset
patients, whether or not they respond to  xxxd1868xxx . it
was found in 5% of the neonates and 30% of the
infants who were tested. these patients must not
undergo pancreatic catheterisation and a leucinerestricted diet must be tested. rare causes of secondary
hyperinsulinism, such as a congenital disorder of
glycosylation [4] or a munchausen-by-proxy syndrome,

should also be routinely eliminated before invasive
investigations and surgical treatment are undertaken.
isolated hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is histologically heterogeneous, with potentially dramatic implications for the extent of pancreatectomy (when
indicated) and long-term patient outcome. late-onset
hypoglycaemia, after 1 year of life, strongly suggests an
adenoma which is cured by its removal.
both focal adenomatous hyperplasia and diuse
hyperinsulinism are found in neonatal- and infancyonset patients. no clinical symptom can help distinguish between the two histological forms [2]. it is
crucial to identify the focal lesions, as 46% of our
surgically-treated patients had a focal lesion (29 neonates and 13 infants) and hypoglycaemia was cured by
a limited pancreatic resection. it is also crucial to
precisely locate the focal lesion, because surgeons
usually resect pancreatic tissue by ®rst removing the
tail and the body of the pancreas, while it was in the
head of the pancreas in more than 33% of cases.
preoperative classical radiology of the pancreas, including echotomography, ct scan and mri, do not
identify the focal lesions. they are also too small to be
detected during surgery. the aim of pancreatic venous
catheterisation, with measurement of insulin in the
various pancreatic veins, is to locate the lesion [5].
pancreatic catheterisation should not be performed
before the 1st month of life because of transient forms
or in patients with hyperammonaemia who are likely
to have diuse hyperinsulinism. intra-operative histological examination makes the ®nal distinction between
diuse and focal lesions and limited pancreatic resections are guided by the results of pancreatic catheterisation [14].
the various histological forms of hyperinsulinism
correspond to speci®c genetic abnormalities. the focal
form is due to a loss of the maternal allele of the 11p15
region restricted to the lesion with reduction to homozygosity of a paternally inherited mutation in the  xxxg19xxx 
or  xxxg1250xxx  genes [3,25]. the somatic character of the
lesion suggests a sporadic occurrence that is con®rmed
by the lack of familial forms.
diuse forms probably correspond to heterogeneous entities that remain to be clari®ed. the majority of cases of neonatal-onset hyperinsulinaemic
patients were associated with the  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx 
genes. some were homozygous for the mutations, as
reported in other populations. however, only one
mutation of either gene, either of paternal or maternal
origin, was detected in the majority of these patients.
only two infancy-onset patients, with diuse hyperinsulinism, had a  xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx  mutation. most
patients with  xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx  mutations were resistant to  xxxd1868xxx , whatever the focal or diuse type
of the lesion.

47

despite the genetic heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism, the clinical characteristics of hypoglycaemia vary
principally with the age at onset. only  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive neonates tend to have transient or associated
hyperinsulinism, while a late onset of hypoglycaemia is
linked to an adenoma (insulinoma). the treatment of
hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is the main diculty
in neonates, whereas an important concern in infancyonset hyperinsulinism is delayed diagnosis because of
good tolerance of hypoglycaemia. infants medically
treated are probably underestimated in this study because most patients who were referred from other
countries were resistant to  xxxd1868xxx  and underwent
pancreatic catheterisation that only our radiologist
could perform. k+atp channel mutations are responsible for at least 50% of the diuse cases of neonatal
hyperinsulinism and for 84% of focal cases [6]. by
contrast, few mutations were found in infancy-onset
diuse hyperinsulinism. the heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism has major consequences in terms of outcome
because the therapeutic approach and genetic counselling dier radically.
