abstract: the adjuvant treatment of women with endocrine-sensitive early breast cancer has
been dominated for the last 40 years by tamoxifen. however, the side-effects associated with this
therapy have prompted a search for safer and biochemically more selective endocrine agents and
led to the development of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (ais) anastrozole, letrozole
and exemestane. promising results in advanced disease have paved the way for treating early
breast cancer, and ais are increasingly replacing tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. several
large, randomized trials with ais have been completed or are ongoing in women with early-stage
breast cancer, documenting the signiﬁcant impact that these drugs are making on the risk for
recurrence of breast cancer. as a result, there is increasing and widespread use of ai therapy
for the treatment of early-stage endocrine-responsive breast cancer. this review summarizes
the data for exemestane in the adjuvant setting, showing that a switch to exemestane after 2 to
3 years of tamoxifen therapy is associated with a statistically signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt and is
regarded as being sensitive by international and national experts.

despite the improvement in survival observed with tamoxifen, a considerable
proportion of women with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer do not appear to beneﬁt
from the orally active selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator (serm): more than half
of the women experience breast cancer relapses and more than two thirds of deaths
occur after the initial 5 years after surgery (early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative
group 1998, 2005, 2007).
laboratory studies indicate that a reduction in the antagonist properties of tamoxifen
could be caused by the up-regulation of  xxxg2198xxx  receptors, especially her2 and
epidermal growth-factor receptors (egfr), downstream protein kinases, or both, resulting
in either primary or adaptive/acquired resistance to tamoxifen (osborne et al 2003; shou
et al 2004). in addition, tamoxifen-treated patients may be exposed to a modest increased
risk of vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer, and venous thrombosis.
these limitations have prompted the search for alternative endocrine therapies with
increased efﬁcacy and fewer long-term complications and led to the development of
anti-aromatase inhibitors (ais). these compounds work by blocking the aromatase enzyme
in the ﬁnal step of estrogen synthesis, thus lowering circulating estrogen levels. the ais in
clinical use today include the third-generation steroidal irreversible, type i ai exemestane
and the nonsteroidal reversible, type ii ais anastrozole and letrozole. the suppression
of circulating estrogen is profound, approximately 95% to 98% with all third-generation
ais (geisler et al 1998). this is the general explanation for the observed better efﬁcacy
of aromatase inhibitors compared to tamoxifen. in addition, ais inhibit the cytochrome
p450-dependent aromatase enzyme, lacking tamoxifen’s partial agonist activity.
tamoxifen is partly metabolized by cyp enzymes. decreased cyp2d6metabolism, either because of mutations in the cyp2d6 gene and/or because of

comedication with cyp2d6 inhibitors, may result in a
decreased efﬁcacy of the drug (jin et al 2005). in the respective group of these individuals it is hypothesized that the
use of cyp2d6 independently metabolized drugs such as
ais may be beneﬁcial. clinical studies to clarify this issue
are ongoing.

pharmacology of exemestane
exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator,
structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione.
it acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is
processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the
active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an effect
also known as “suicide inhibition” (dank 2002; dixon
2004). exemestane signiﬁcantly lowers circulating estrogen
concentrations: after a single oral dose of 25 mg the levels of
estrogen, estradiol, and estrogen-sulfate decrease by 85% to
95% after 2 to 3 days and persist up to 5 days (johannessen
et al 1997). exemestane has no detectable effect on adrenal
biosynthesis of corticosteroids, aldosterone, or on other
enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a
concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting
the aromatase enzyme (dixon 2004).
the recommended dosage of exemestane is 25 mg taken
orally once daily after a meal which is rapidly absorbed
with a maximum plasma concentration observed within
2 hours of ingestion (evans 1992). exemestane is distributed
extensively into tissues and is 90% bound to plasma proteins,
steady-state conditions are attained by 7 days (clemett
and lamb 2000). the agent is metabolized by cyp3a4 to
compounds that are inactive or show minimal inhibition
of aromatase (wong and pritchard 2005). excretion of
exemestane is via the urine and faeces, with ⬍1% of the drug
being excreted unchanged in urine. although the area under
the curve (auc) of exemestane after a single 25-mg dose
is elevated 3-fold in severe renal or liver dysfunction, dose
reduction is not required as the drug is well tolerated in breast
cancer patients at even 8- to 24-fold higher than the recommended dose (wong and pritchard 2005).

exemestane in the adjuvant setting
the efﬁcacy of exemestane in the treatment of women
with early breast cancer was evaluated in 3 large randomized trials. a third study is in progress. exemestane was approved in the us and european union for
the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with
endocrine-sensitive early breast cancer who have received
2 to 3 years of tamoxifen and are switched to exemestane

1296

for the completion of a total of 5 consecutive years of
adjuvant hormonal therapy.

intergroup study ies 31
the approval was based on the data of the double-blind,
randomized, adjuvant intergroup exemestane study (ies)
comparing 5 years of tamoxifen with the sequential use
of tamoxifen followed by exemestane for a total treatment
duration of 5 years. the trial included 4,742 postmenopausal
patients from 37 countries and 20 co-operative groups with
endocrine-sensitive early completely resected breast cancer.
all of them were disease free after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen
and were randomized in the intent-to-treat (itt) analysis to
receive either tamoxifen once daily at the same dose received
before randomization (n = 2,372) or exemestane (5 mg once
daily; n = 2,352). the endocrine therapy was ﬁnished after
5 years (figure 1).
the primary end point was disease-free survival (dfs),
deﬁned as the time from randomization to time of local or
distant recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral invasive
breast cancer, or death from any cause. secondary end points
included overall survival (os), the incidence of contralateral
breast cancer, and long- term tolerability.
the ﬁrst planned interim analysis after a median follow-up
of 30.6 months showed a signiﬁcant improvement in dfs,
relatively by 32%, absolutely by 4.7% (unadjusted hazard
ratio [hr] 0.68; 95% conﬁdence interval [ci] 0.56–0.82;
p ⬍ 0.001) (coombes et al 2004). dfs 3 years after
randomization was 91.5% (95% ci 90.0–92.7) in the
exemestane group and 86.8% (95% ci 85.1–88.3) in the
tamoxifen group. furthermore, the ai proved to be signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than tamoxifen in all subgroups, deﬁned
according to estrogen-receptor (er) status, combined er and
progesterone-receptor status, number of positive nodes, type
of previous chemotherapy, or use at any time of hormonereplacement therapy (hrt).
there was also signiﬁcant superiority of exemestane
in regard to distant dfs (hr 0.66; 95% ci 0.52–0.83;
p = 0.0004) and in the risk for contralateral breast cancer
(hr 0.44; 95 % ci 0.20–0.98).
the updated evaluation covering a median follow-up of
55.7 months reinforced the earlier ﬁndings and demonstrated
that switching to exemestane remained signiﬁcantly superior
to remaining on tamoxifen (coombes et al 2007). a total of
809 events contributing to the analysis of dfs had been reported
(354 exemestane, 455 tamoxifen), leading to an unadjusted
hr for the itt group for dfs of 0.76 (95% ci 0.66–0.88;
p = 0.0001) in favor of exemestane (figure 2). in the itt group,

this hr translated into a 3.3% (95% ci 1.6–4.9) absolute
improvement in dfs at 2.5 years after randomization, and
a 3.4% (0.1–6.8) improvement 5 years after randomization.
adjusting for potential confounders did not substantially affect
the estimates of treatment effect, and the size of beneﬁt for
switching to exemestane was consistent across all subgroups
and any tumor characteristic that was measured (figure 3).
breast-cancer-free survival was also improved by switching to

exemestane for the itt group (hr 0.76; 95% ci 0.65–0.89,
p = 0.004).
these data resulted in a survival beneﬁt. in the itt
analysis 222 deaths occurred in the exemestane and
261 in the tamoxifen group, accounting for a relative risk
reduction of 15% (p = 0.08) (figure 4). since the second
analysis, previously unknown er status was ascertained
in 381 women. of these, 122 were identiﬁed as having

er-negative tumors, and therefore, in addition to an itt
analysis, those with er-negative tumors were excluded and
further analysis carried out. after exclusion of er-negative
tumors and a protocol-deﬁned adjustment for nodal status,
chemotherapy use, and hrt use, the adjusted hr for death
was 0.83 (95% ci 0.69–0.99, p = 0.04) (figure 4). as also
shown in the second analysis, exemestane was generally
well tolerated, undesirable effects were usually mild to
moderate.
the clinical beneﬁts were achieved without a detrimental
effect on quality of life (qol), as demonstrated in
the ies-qol substudy (fallowfield et al 2006). the
switch from tamoxifen to exemestane neither increased
nor decreased endocrine symptoms present after 2 to 3
years of tamoxifen, and did not initiate signiﬁcant new
symptoms.

nsabp b-33 study
in may 2001, the national surgical adjuvant breast
and bowel project (nsabp) initiated a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate
exemestane (25 mg/day orally) as extended adjuvant
therapy (nsabp b-33). the trial included clinical stage

1298

t1–3 n0–1 m0 endocrine-sensitive postmenopausal breast
cancer patients who completed at least 5 years of tamoxifen
therapy and were disease-free at the time of tamoxifen
discontinuation. the primary aim of the trial was to
determine whether adjuvant exemestane, for 2 years, after
5 years of tamoxifen therapy would prolong dfs compared
with placebo. secondary endpoints were os and relapsefree survival (rfs).
when accrual to the b-33 trial was initiated, no other
information existed on beneﬁt from aromatase inhibitors
in this setting. however, in october 2003, while accrual
to b-33 was ongoing (1,598 patients had been accrued
of 3,000 required), interim analysis results from another
similarly designed trial (national cancer institute of canada
[ncic] ma.17) demonstrated beneﬁt from letrozole in
patients who had completed 5 years of tamoxifen became
available (goss et al 2003). as a consequence, the accrual
to b-33 was stopped, the treatment assignment unblinded,
and exemestane offered to women in the placebo group.
at the time of unblinding, 1,598 patients had been randomly
assigned; 72% in the exemestane group continued on
exemestane and 44% in the placebo group elected to receive
exemestane (figure 5).

hr 0.83 (95% ci 0.69–0.99) p = 0.04, adjustment for pre-specified prognostic factors nodal status, chemotherapy use, hrt use.

mamounas et al (2008) published the data of the
outcome analysis with 30 months of median follow-up based
on the original random assignment (itt), yielding a 32%,
borderline statistically signiﬁcant reduction in 4-year dfs
(91% vs 89%; relative risk [rr] 0.68; p = 0.07) (figure 6)
and in a statistically signiﬁcant 56% decrease in 4-year rfs
(96% vs 94%; rr = 0.44; p = 0.004). toxicity, assessed
up to time of unblinding, was acceptable for the adjuvant
setting.
the reduction of dfs and rfs shown in the nsabp b 33
trial are of a magnitude similar to that seen with the nonsteroidal
ais letrozole and anastrozole in the same setting. the ncic
ma.17 trial demonstrated a 42% reduction in recurrence with
letrozole over placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen (goss et al
2003, 2005). these ﬁndings demonstrate that exemestane may
provide another option for the extended adjuvant treatment of
postmenopausal women with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer
who complete 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.
the international breast cancer study group (ibcsg) is
currently evaluating the role of exemestane (ibcsg 24-02/
big 2-02 [soft]), also in combination with gnrh analogs
(ibcsg 25-02/big 3-02 [text]) as adjuvant therapy for
premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer.
both studies are ongoing and results are not available yet.

safety analysis
overall tolerability
in general, exemestane therapy was well tolerated (coombes
et al 2004, 2007). grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(6)

in 426 (18.4%) patients on exemestane and 411 (17.6%)
on tamoxifen. at a median follow-up of 55.7 months,
switching to exemestane was associated with signiﬁcantly
fewer thromboembolic events (p = 0.004), endometrial
hyperplasia (p ⬍ 0.0001), uterine polyps (p ⬍ 0.0001), and
serious gynecological events (p = 0.0002) than continuing
on tamoxifen.
musculoskeletal pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, joint
stiffness, paraesthesia, and arthralgia were reported more
frequently in patients who switched to exemestane than in
those who remained on tamoxifen. these effects emerged
during the on-treatment period.
myocardial infarctions were rare and occurred in
31 (1.3%) exemestane-treated patients compared with
19 (0.8%) tamoxifen-treated patients (p = 0.08). any effect
of treatment on risk of myocardial infarction seemed largely
restricted to patients with a history of hypertension.

menopausal symptoms
the phase iii, randomized tamoxifen exemestane adjuvant
multicenter (team) trial is a prospective open-label
randomized multicenter study designed specifically to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of upfront adjuvant exemestane therapy
for endocrine-sensitive postmenopausal early breast cancer
in comparison with a crossover design using exemestane
for 2 to 3 years after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. patients
received either tamoxifen 20 mg once daily orally for 2.5 or
3 years followed by exemestane 25 mg once daily for 2 or
2.5 years, or exemestane 25 mg once daily for 5 years,
as a double-blind capsule for year 1, and open label for

4 years. adjuvant hormonal treatment was initiated within
10 weeks after surgery or completion of chemotherapy,
whichever occurred last. the primary endpoint was deﬁned
as dfs, secondary endpoints included os, incidence of new
primary breast cancers, and safety parameters. in addition,
5 substudies were used to separately analyze endometrial
changes, lipid proﬁles, qol, tolerability of therapy, and
bone changes. a meta-analysis of overall drug efﬁcacy will
use data from the combined substudies, but has not been
published yet. however, results of the menopausal substudy
as well as the bone data are available.
jones et al (2007) assessed the prevalence of 10 common
menopausal symptoms associated with either adjuvant
tamoxifen or exemestane by self-report questionnaire
administered to 1,614 consecutive patients at baseline and
every 3 months during the ﬁrst year of the trial. symptoms
were categorized as none, mild, moderate, or severe. a hot
ﬂash score was calculated at each time point. symptoms
were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance.

each time period was tested repeatedly against the
baseline; an overall p-value was assigned for each reported
symptom. the strengths of this study were the large number
of women evaluated (n = 1,614), excellent compliance
(7,286 completed questionnaires; 81% completion at
12 months), and the double-blinded design.
the team study showed at 12 months that patients
receiving tamoxifen, versus those receiving exemestane,
had a signiﬁcantly higher mean hot ﬂush score (p = 0.0253)
and more vaginal discharge (p ⬍ 0.0001), whereas women
under exemestane had more vaginal dryness (p = 0.0004)
and decreased libido (p = 0.0343).
thomas et al (2008) reported in an open-label,
prospective, crossover study with 184 post-menopausal
women experiencing hot ﬂushes on adjuvant tamoxifen that 6
weeks after switching to letrozole or exemestane, the primary
end point, hot ﬂush score, improved by 47.3% (p ⬍ 0.001)
compared to those reported on tamoxifen. the mean mood
rating scale (mrs) score improved by 9.7% (p = 0.01).
at 6 weeks, signiﬁcantly more women chose to remain
on an ai (72% vs 22% preferring tamoxifen; p ⬍ 0.001).
at 3 months, 107 women (58%) preferred to remain on an ai,
55 (30%) on tamoxifen, and 22 (12%) withdrew. these data
suggest that in women suffering signiﬁcant adverse effects
on tamoxifen, switching to an ai like exemestane improves
hot ﬂushes, mood, and quality of life.

bone metabolism
the effects of a profound long-term estrogen deprivation
achievable with the third-generation aromatase inhibitors in
respect to the bone health has been a major concern.
unlike nonsteroidal ais, exemestane may exert
beneﬁcial effects on bone through its primary metabolite
17-hydroexemestane which expresses androgen agonistic
activity. in fact, a preclinical study reported that the
administration of exemestane to ovariectomized rats
reduced both bone formation and resorption markers and
attributed this pattern to the androgenicity of exemestane
and its principal metabolite (goss et al 2004). lønning
et al (2005) reported a signiﬁcant increased serum level
and urinary excretion of bone resorption, but also bone
formation markers in postmenopausal women with early
breast cancer under exemestane 25 mg daily for 2 years
in a double-blind setting which could be due to this
androgenic effect.
in contrast, a subgroup of the ies 31-study focusing
on the effect on bone health showed that within 6 months
of switching to exemestane, bone mineral density (bmd)

lipid profile
given their mechanism of action, one might expect
that ais may have certain adverse effects on multiple
estrogen-dependent metabolic functions such as lipid
metabolism when compared with tamoxifen.
the beneﬁts of receiving an ai are likely to outweigh
the disadvantages of any changes to lipid profiles.
however, when these compounds are used in early disease
or in the prevention setting, an increase of 10% to 15%
in circulating cholesterol and triglycerides may have a
signiﬁcant impact on the risk of cardiovascular disease,
and monitoring of blood lipid levels and instigation of
lipid lowering treatment if required should be undertaken
(bundred 2005).

was lowered by 0.051 g/cm 3 (2.7%; 95% ci 2.0–3.4;
p ⬍ 0.0001) at the lumbar spine and 0.025 g/cm3 (1.4%;
0.8–1.9; p ⬍ 0.0001) at the hip compared with baseline
(coleman et al 2007). however, bmd decreases were only
1.0% (0.4–1.7; p = 0.002) and 0.8% (0.3–1.4; p = 0.003) in
year 2 at the lumbar spine and hip, respectively (figure 7).
further decreases were smaller and approached rates observed
in a healthy age-matched population. no patient with bmd
in the normal range at trial entry developed osteoporosis.
bone resorption and formation markers increased at all time
points in women receiving exemestane (p ⬍ 0.001). with
a median follow-up in all ies participants (n = 4,274) of
58 months, 162 (7%) and 115 (5%) patients in the exemestane
and tamoxifen groups, respectively, had fractures (odds ratio
1.45 [1.13–1.87]; p = 0.003).
these ﬁ ndings are in accordance with the data of
another study in postmenopausal patients switched to
exemestane after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant treatment with
tamoxifen, showing a marked increase in bone turnover
markers with a consequent reduction in bmd (gonelli
et al 2007).this pattern of bmd is more evident at skeletal
sites where trabecular bone prevails and is most likely
due to rapid cessation of bone turnover suppression by
tamoxifen.
these findings corroborate the results of the bone
team-substudy, evaluating 161 women receiving tamoxifen
(n = 78) or exemestane (n = 83), showing a loss in absolute
bmd under exemestane at 12 months (hadji et al 2008).
the difference was signiﬁcant at the spine (p = 0.0008 and
hip (p = 0.04). however, during the second year of treatment,
the rate of bmd loss slowed dramatically. all measured
markers of bone formation and resorption show an increase
with exemestane.

a subprotocol to the atena (adjuvant posttamoxifen exemestane versus nothing applied) trial
compared the effect of exemestane on the lipid proﬁle in
the adjuvant setting to that of observation alone following
deprivation of 5 to 7 years primary treatment with
tamoxifen (markopoulos et al 2005). in this open-label,
randomized, parallel group study, 340 post-menopausal
women with operable breast cancer who had been treated
with tamoxifen for 5 to 7 years were randomized to either
5 additional years of exemestane (25 mg/day; n = 172) or
observation alone (n = 168).
total serum triglycerides (trg) levels were signiﬁcantly
reduced compared with baseline for the exemestane and the
observational arm. both total cholesterol and low-density
lipoprotein (ldl) concentrations signiﬁcantly increased
above that of baseline values by 6 months, maintained
through to 12 months, with no signiﬁcant difference between
the two treatment arms. there was no signiﬁcant alteration
observed for high-density lipoprotein (hdl) over time or
between the two arms. in conclusion, switching patients to
adjuvant exemestane treatment does not induce major effects
on serum lipids.

endometrial effects
a prospective open label randomized multicenter substudy
was performed in the german team trial group to test the
hypothesis that the irreversible inactivation of aromatase by
exemestane (exe; n = 78) would result in less endometrial

after a median follow-up of 727 (exe) and 526 days
(tam), endometrial hyperplasia was observed in 11 patients
in the exemestane-arm versus 45 patients under tamoxifen
(p ⬍ 0.0001). time to endometrial hyperplasia was signiﬁcantly
longer in the exe group (p ⬍ 0.0001); hr was 0.160 indicating
an 84% risk reduction of hyperplasia in the exe group. only
one patient underwent histological sampling in the exe group
(no hyperplasia) versus 18 in the tam subset.

thompson et al (2007) performed an analysis of the costeffectiveness of switching to exemestane versus staying on
tamoxifen based on the ies data. because the trial data span
a limited period of time and do not include information on
resource utilization, the authors used modeling techniques
and data from sources external to the ies to project long-term
survival and economic costs.
a markov model was developed to predict patients’
transitions across various health states based on treatment
strategy (continuing tamoxifen vs switching to exemestane),
breast cancer status (no recurrence, local or distant
recurrence, contralateral breast cancer), and other related
health events (osteoporosis, endometrial cancer, death). rates
of disease-related events (recurrence and contralateral breast
cancer) were estimated using data from the ies. survival and
lifetime medical-care costs by type of disease-related event
were estimated using seer-medicare data. the model was
used to estimate direct costs (in 2004 us$7,724 per patient),
life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (qalys), and
incremental cost-effectiveness.
switching to exemestane versus continuing tamoxifen
therapy was associated with an increased disease-free survival,
qalys (12.21 vs 11.89), and net discounted lifetime costs
of cancer care ($12,124 vs $7,724 per patient). the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of exemestane was $20,100
per qaly gained (95% ci $12,100, $59,000). according to
the authors’ conclusion, the switch-to-exemestane strategy
versus completing a 5-year course of tamoxifen is a costeffective use of health-care resources, despite the fact that the
per-day cost of exemestane therapy is nearly 3 times higher
than that of tamoxifen.

new disease in the contralateral breast or distant recurrence,
independent of any tumor characteristics (coombes
et al 2007). as shown in the updated results, the early
improvements in dfs noted in patients who switched to
exemestane persist after treatment, and translate into a modest
improvement in overall survival. in addition, the ﬁndings of
the ies also demonstrate that the beneﬁt of switching from
tamoxifen to an ai in patients with endocrine-responsive
breast cancer persists for some years after discontinuation
of the ai.
so far, no data are available from trials that directly
compare use of ai monotherapy with a sequential or switch
strategy. therefore, direct evidence from the sequential
therapy arms of big 1–98 and from the team trial 18 is
awaited with keen interest to conclude on the value of the
sequential strategy.
exemestane appears to be different from other aromatase
inhibitors with its less detrimental effect on bone after

12 months of treatment. however, the available data do
not enable conﬁrmation that exemestane may have any
substantial advantageous effects on bone with respect to
the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (gonelli et al 2007).
the data suggest that postmenopausal women switched from
tamoxifen to exemestane should be monitored for bone loss in
accordance with the american society of clinical oncology
recommendations (hillner et al 2003), especially if other risk
factors for osteoporosis are present.
the national (ie, ago breast commission) and
international guidelines recommend 3 strategies:
1. upfront treatment with letrozole or anastrozole
2. switching to exemestane or anastrozole after 2 to 3 years
of tamoxifen
3. extended adjuvant treatment with letrozole after
completion of 5 years of tamoxifen
to date, the data are in favor of both upfront ais or switch
to an ai in patients already on tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years not
having relapsed while on tamoxifen.
