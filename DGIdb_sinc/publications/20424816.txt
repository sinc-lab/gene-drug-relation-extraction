abstract
aims/hypothesis five insulin analogues, with modified
insulin-like molecular structures, are currently approved for
treating diabetic patients. they activate cell signalling and
biological responses via  xxxg1194xxx  isoforms (ir-a and
ir-b), each having specific characteristics for eliciting cell
responses. the molecular and biological effects of these
analogues on receptor isoforms in comparison to native
insulin are not well defined, and their effects on the  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) are controversial. the characterisation of
these effects was the aim of the present study.
methods short-acting (insulin lispro [b28lys,b29pro human
insulin], insulin aspart [b28asp  xxxd2364xxx ], insulin
glulisine [b3lys,b29glu  xxxd2364xxx ]) and long-acting
( xxxd2362xxx  [a21gly,b31arg,b32arg  xxxd2364xxx ],
 xxxd2361xxx  [b29lys(epsilon-tetradecanoyl),desb30 human
insulin]) insulin analogues were studied in three engineered
cell models (r−,  xxxg1145xxx -deprived mouse fibroblasts transfected with either only human ir-a or ir-b or  xxxg1145xxx ).
receptor binding and phosphorylation, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) activation, cell proliferation and colony formation were evaluated after exposing the
cells to each analogue and were compared with insulin,  xxxg1144xxx 
and the carcinogenic analogue b10asp.

results all short-acting insulin analogues produced molecular and biological effects similar but not identical to those
of insulin. relative to insulin, long-acting analogues more
strongly activated the erk pathway via both ir-a and
 xxxg1145xxx  as well as increased cell proliferation. at the concentration tested, no analogue (except b10asp via ir-a)
had increased transforming activity.
conclusions/interpretation cell models that permit comparisons of the activity of insulin to that of insulin
analogues via each receptor individually indicate that only
minor differences exist between insulin and short-acting
analogues. by contrast, long-acting analogues activate the
mitogenic signalling pathway more effectively than insulin
and cause increased cell proliferation.

introduction
insulin has well-documented mitogenic effects in addition
to its typical metabolic effects. the mitogenic effects of
hyperinsulinaemia may be clinically relevant when considering the large number of individuals with endogenous or
exogenous hyperinsulinaemia and the long duration of
treatment in diabetic patients [1, 2]. these concerns also
apply to insulin analogues with molecular structures similar

1744

to that of insulin, which may be used to obtain either faster or
more prolonged metabolic effects and improved metabolic
control [3, 4]. insulin analogues may interact differently
with receptors for insulin (ir) or  xxxg1144xxx  ( xxxg1145xxx ), activating
metabolic and mitogenic pathways in a different way from
native insulin [4–9]. potential risks have been documented
for b10asp, a single amino acid substituted insulin
analogue that has increased affinity for both ir and  xxxg1145xxx 
as well as longer residence on the ir [10–13]. these
biological characteristics are associated with increased
mammary tumours in b10asp-treated female rats [14, 15].
during preclinical and clinical experimentation, all insulin
analogues have been tested for their mitogenic potential,
but available data are incomplete [16] and sometimes
contradictory. for this reason, most analogues are not
indicated for treating diabetes during pregnancy.
in addition, it is well known that the  xxxg1194xxx  may
be produced as a or b isoforms with different biological
characteristics [17, 18]. only minimal data are available on
analogue interaction with these isoforms. this information
might be important, because the metabolic and/or mitogenic
responses of target cells may also depend on the type and
proportion of the different receptors they produce [19, 20].
ir-a, for example, is also a high-affinity igf2 receptor
with stronger mitogenic (rather than metabolic) activity
than ir-b, which, in contrast, is the typical insulin target
tissue receptor and mainly mediates metabolic activity [21].
to investigate the effects of insulin analogues via ir
isoforms or  xxxg1145xxx  without the interference of their binding
to and activation of the other components of the ir family,
we examined the in vitro effects of insulin analogues in an
engineered cell model producing only human ir-a, ir-b or
 xxxg1145xxx . in these cells, receptor binding and phosphorylation, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)
(key signalling proteins for the metabolic and the mitogenic
activities of insulin, respectively) activation [22], cell
proliferation and colony formation in soft agar were all
measured to evaluate the metabolic, mitogenic and transforming potential of each analogue. the study aimed to
evaluate the interaction of each analogue with each specific
receptor and the consequent signalling activation, as well as
the biological response, in comparison with native insulin,
 xxxg1144xxx  and the carcinogenic insulin analogue b10asp.

methods
all reagents for cell culture were purchased from sigma
(st louis, mo, usa). the rapid-acting insulin analogues
aspart (b28asp  xxxd2364xxx ) and glulisine (b3lys,
b29glu  xxxd2364xxx ) as well as the long-acting insulin
analogue  xxxd2362xxx  (a21gly,b31arg,b32arg  xxxd2364xxx ) were provided by sanofi-aventis (paris, france), as

diabetologia (2010) 53:1743–1753

was the carcinogenic insulin analogue b10asp [14, 15].
lispro (b28lys,b29pro  xxxd2364xxx ) was provided by
eli lilly (indianapolis, in, usa), and the long-acting
 xxxd2361xxx  [b29lys(epsilon-tetradecanoyl),desb30 human
insulin] was purchased from novo nordisk (bagsvaerd,
denmark).  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxg1144xxx  were purchased from
calbiochem (darmstadt, germany). all ligands were used
at 5 nmol/l except  xxxd2361xxx , which contains 3.9 times more
insulin per 1 iu than native insulin or other insulin
analogues (in terms of biological potency, 0.142 mg
 xxxd2361xxx  is equivalent to 0.036 mg insulin). to better mirror
the dose equivalence in clinical use, therefore,  xxxd2361xxx  was
used at 19 nmol/l, a concentration underestimated according
to a recent report that indicated that a tenfold higher
concentration of  xxxd2361xxx  is required to achieve a similar
maximal biological activity to native insulin in vitro [23].
biotin was obtained from calbiochem. bacto-agar was
from becton dickinson (bd biosciences, franklin lakes,
nj, usa). the delfia cell proliferation kit, 125i-labelled
insulin and 125i-labelled  xxxg1144xxx  were purchased from perkinelmer (waltham, ma, usa).
rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognising either the ir betasubunit or  xxxg1145xxx  beta-subunit were from santa cruz
biotechnology (santa cruz, ca, usa); anti-phosphoerk1/2, anti-phospho-akt, anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 and anti-akt
antibodies were from cell signaling technology (danvers,
ma, usa); and anti- xxxd1075xxx  monoclonal antibody
4g10 was from upstate biotechnology (waltham, ma, usa).
cell models
r− cells, provided by r. baserga (kimmel cancer center,
philadelphia, pa, usa), are mouse embryonic fibroblasts
derived from animals with a target disruption of the  xxxg1145xxx 
gene and therefore do not produce  xxxg1145xxx . like nih 3t3
fibroblasts, r− cells produce endogenous mouse ir at a low
level (approximately 5×103 receptors/cell) as ir-a isoform
[24]. r− cells were stably transfected with the pntk2
expression vectors containing the cdnas for either the a
(ex11−) or the b (ex11+) isoforms of human ir or the
pece expression vector containing the human  xxxg1145xxx 
cdna, as previously reported [21].
receptor expression in each cell type was evaluated by
rt-pcr, western blot (see electronic supplementary
material [esm] fig. 1a) and specific elisa [25], which
indicated a receptor protein content of 40.5 ng/100 mug
protein in r−/ir-a cells (approximately 1.5×105 receptors/
cell), 26.8 ng/100 mug protein (1.0×105 receptors/cell) in
r−/ir-b cells and 79 ng/100 mug protein or 2.4×105
receptors/cell in r+ cells. exposure of these cells to the
specific ligands, but not to the unrelated ligand egf, causes
receptor and intracellular signalling protein phosphorylation
(esm fig. 1b). all transfected cells contained high levels

diabetologia (2010) 53:1743–1753

of the ectopic human receptor (ir-a, ir-b or  xxxg1145xxx ) and
low levels (5×103) of mouse ir-a. hypothetically, heterospecific hybrid receptors can be formed (mouse ir-a/
human ir-a, ir-b or  xxxg1145xxx  hemi-receptors), but this was
never demonstrated. however, because of the high ratio of
transfected human receptors to endogenous mouse ir-a
and the reduced affinity of hemi-receptors from different
species, the resulting random hybrid receptor formation is
likely to be absent or very low.
in these cell types, duplication time in 0.1% bsa was slow
(30 h for r−/ir-a and r+ cells and 42 h for r−/ir-b cells).
the proliferation response to hormones was evaluated by
trypan blue count, and it indicated that cells responded to
the ligand of the transfected and expressed receptor (esm
fig. 1c). no hormone or analogue had a mitogenic effect
(evaluated by brdu incorporation into newly synthesised
dna) on parental, empty vector-transfected r− cells (esm
fig. 1d).
binding studies
binding studies were carried out in intact cells grown to
approximately 80% confluence, serum starved for 16–18 h
and harvested in pbs containing 1 mmol/l edta and 0.1%
bsa. cells were incubated in the presence of increasing
concentrations of either unlabelled insulin,  xxxg1144xxx  or the
insulin analogues in red phenol-free minimum essential
medium containing 100 mmol/l hepes, 0.1% bsa and
0.06 mg/ml bacitracin. the tracer (0.2 ng/ml 125i-labelled
insulin for r−/ir-a and r−/ir-b cells or 0.1 ng/ml
125
i-labelled  xxxg1144xxx  for r+ cells) was added for 16 h at 4°c,
and then cells were washed twice with cold 10 mmol/l trisbuffered saline and the cell-associated radioactivity measured. the ec50 was calculated by scatchard analysis
(non-linear regression algorithm in graphpad prism 4 software [san diego, ca, usa]). in the cell models used,
neither total nor non-specific binding of insulin was affected
by bsa concentrations in the range 0.1–1%.

substrate activation, membranes were immunoblotted with
either an anti-phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 or an anti-phospho-akt
antibody. the membranes were then stripped and reprobed
with the anti-akt or anti  xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody. dose–response
(0.05–50 nmol/l) studies were carried out with insulin,
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  (esm fig. 2).
biological effects
proliferation studies the capacity of hormones and analogues to stimulate proliferation was evaluated using a
time-resolved fluorometric immunoassay based on brdu
incorporation into newly synthesised dna. as this reaction
is influenced by cell proliferation rate, preliminary tests
indicated an appropriate brdu incubation time of 6 h. cells
were seeded at 1.2×103 cells/well for r−/ir-a and r+ and
at 2.0×103 cells/well for r−/ir-b cells that have a lower
proliferation rate. cells starved of serum for 24 h were
exposed for 18 h to 5 nmol/l of hormones or analogues
(except  xxxd2361xxx , at 19 nmol/l). brdu (10 mumol/l) was added
during the last 6 h of cell exposure to different ligands, and
then cells were fixed and dna denatured. incorporated
brdu was detected using 0.5 mug/ml europium-labelled
monoclonal antibody, and fluorescence activity (proportional
to dna synthesis) was measured by the multilabel counter
wallac 1420 victor3 (perkin-elmer).
anchorage independent growth transformation potential of
hormones and analogues was evaluated by colony formation in semi-solid agar. briefly, 1×103 cells/well were
resuspended and seeded in a six-well plate in 0.3% bactoagar in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem)
with 5% calf serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. wells were
pre-coated with 1 ml solid agar (0.6% bacto-agar in the
same dmem medium). hormones or analogues (5 nmol/l,
except  xxxd2361xxx , at 19 nmol/l) were added 24 h after seeding
time and then again every 48 h. after 2 weeks, cells were
stained with 0.5 mg/ml p-iodonitrotetrazolium, photographed and counted.

receptor autophosphorylation and intracellular substrate
( xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt) activation
statistical analysis
serum-starved cells were exposed to 5 nmol/l of insulin,
 xxxg1144xxx  or the insulin analogues for the times indicated. cell
lysates were subjected to reducing sds-page on either
7.5% (ir and  xxxg1145xxx ) or 10% ( xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt) polyacrylamide gels. after electrophoresis, resolved proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected
to immunoblot analysis.
for ir and  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation, blots were first
probed with anti- xxxd1075xxx  4g10 antibody, and then
membranes were stripped and reprobed with either anti-ir
or anti- xxxg1145xxx  polyclonal antibodies. for intracellular

paired, two-tailed student’s t tests with 95% ci were
used to compare the binding affinities (ec50 value) and
the proliferative effects of analogues with respect to
insulin or  xxxg1144xxx . proliferation data were averaged from 11
separate experiments, each simultaneously evaluating all
the ligands under study. phosphorylated protein densitometric values were determined by averaging three independent experiments, and calculations were performed
using a two-way anova test with graphpad prism 4
software. further methods can be found in the esm.

results
receptor binding
insulin bound with high affinity to both ir isoforms but did
not bind to  xxxg1145xxx ;  xxxg1144xxx  bound with high affinity to
 xxxg1145xxx , with low affinity to ir-a (p<0.01 vs insulin) and
did not bind to ir-b. b10asp affinity was significantly
higher than that of insulin for both ir-a and ir-b and also
for  xxxg1145xxx  (table 1). all short-acting analogues had ec50
values similar to that of insulin for both ir-a and ir-b
isoforms. like insulin, no short-acting analogues bound to
 xxxg1145xxx . both long-acting analogues had a lower binding
affinity for ir-a relative to insulin.  xxxd2361xxx  had a
much lower affinity than insulin for ir-b. by contrast, both
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  bound  xxxg1145xxx  with higher affinity than
insulin but lower than  xxxg1144xxx  (table 1).
receptor phosphorylation
receptor phosphorylation induced by insulin,  xxxg1144xxx  and
b10asp reflected their binding affinity. in response to
insulin, both ir isoforms were phosphorylated, whereas
 xxxg1145xxx  was only weakly phosphorylated (figs 1, 2 and 3).
however, both the magnitude and the kinetics of insulininduced receptor phosphorylation differed, being 25–30%
greater in r−/ir-b cells but more sustained in r−/ir-a
cells. the effect of b10asp on ir-a, ir-b and  xxxg1145xxx 
phosphorylation was not different from that elicited by
insulin (figs 1, 2 and 3). by contrast,  xxxg1144xxx  actively
phosphorylated  xxxg1145xxx  but had no significant effect on ira and ir-b.
all three short-acting analogues caused ir-a phosphorylation similar to insulin in terms of magnitude and
activation pattern (fig. 1), whereas they caused shorterlasting ir-b phosphorylation than insulin, although the
differences were not statistically significant (fig. 2). these
analogues had a similar effect on  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation to

that of insulin (fig. 3).  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  had an effect
on ir-a and ir-b phosphorylation similar to that elicited
by insulin (figs 1 and 2), but they differed in  xxxg1145xxx 
phosphorylation:  xxxd2362xxx  was similar to insulin, whereas
 xxxd2361xxx  induced a significantly (p<0.01) more marked
effect (fig. 3).
intracellular signalling: akt and erk phosphorylation
after exposure to insulin, erk activation kinetics diverged
from akt activation kinetics in the different cell lines. in
ir-a expressing cells (fig. 4), erk activation increased in
a time-dependent manner, whereas akt activation peaked
early and decreased by 10 min. therefore, the erk:akt
activation ratio increased with time, with a progressive
erk predominance (fig. 4). by contrast, in ir-b-expressing cells and in r+ cells, insulin-induced akt and erk
phosphorylation followed a similar time–activation pattern
(figs 5 and 6). in all cell types, b10asp activated akt in a
similar way to insulin (figs 4, 5 and 6), but it was
significantly more effective than insulin at activating erk
in r−/ir-a and r+ cells (figs 4, 5 and 6). in r+ cells,
b10asp paralleled the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  (fig. 6).
short-acting analogues had a similar but more persistent
effect compared with insulin on akt phosphorylation in
r−/ir-a cells (p<0.05  xxxd1891xxx  min for all short-acting
analogues) (fig. 4). in these cells, the activation of erk
by short-acting analogues was not significantly different
from insulin, although the time profile of aspart and lispro
appeared different from that of glulisine (fig. 4).
in r−/ir-b cells, lispro and glulisine but not aspart
phosphorylated akt less than insulin did (p<0.05 for both
analogues) (fig. 5). in these cells, all short-acting analogues
had a delayed effect relative to insulin on erk phosphorylation, and this was significantly reduced for glulisine (p<0.01)
and lispro (p<0.05) (fig. 5). all short-acting analogues, like
insulin, had only a minimal effect on akt and erk in
 xxxg1145xxx -producing r+ cells (fig. 6).

indicated in the methods. cell lysates were separated by sds-page
and immunoblotted with 4g10  xxxd1075xxx  antibody. membranes
were stripped and reprobed with irbeta-specific antibody to control for

protein loading. blots (upper panel) are representative of three

 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  activated akt similarly to insulin
in ir-a- and  xxxg1145xxx -producing cells (figs 4 and 6) but
significantly less than insulin in ir-b-producing cells
(p<0.001 for both) (fig. 5). by contrast, erk phosphorylation induced by  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  was significantly
higher than insulin at 3 and 5 min in r−/ir-a cells (p<0.05 for
 xxxd2362xxx  and p<0.01 for  xxxd2361xxx ) (fig. 4) but was similar to
insulin in r−/ir-b cells (fig. 5). therefore, both long-acting
analogues caused an erk:akt activation ratio clearly
shifted in favour of erk in all cell models. in igf1rexpressing cells, their effect was similar to that of  xxxg1144xxx  and
higher than that of insulin (p<0.001 for both) (fig. 6).
these observations were confirmed in dose–response
experiments where, in ir-a- and  xxxg1145xxx -producing cells,
both  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  phosphorylated erk more than

insulin at all concentrations, including the lowest tested
(0.05 nmol/l) (esm fig. 2).

insulin induced significant proliferation in both ir-a- and

whereas it was ineffective in r+ cells (fig. 7). by contrast,
 xxxg1144xxx  induced proliferation in r+ cells but had no effect in
r−/ir-a and r−/ir-b cells (fig. 7).
short-acting analogues had a proliferative effect similar
to insulin in r−/ir-a and r−/ir-b cells (fig. 7). in igf1rproducing cells, lispro and aspart were similar to insulin,
whereas glulisine induced more proliferation than insulin
(p<0.05) (fig. 7).

without effect in r−/ir-b cells. at the concentration tested,
no insulin analogue had an increased capacity for promoting
anchorage-independent cell growth with respect to insulin
except b10asp, which was twofold more effective than
insulin in r−/ir-a cells (table 2). further results can be
found in the esm.

molecular and biological levels are not well defined.
numerous studies have tested the biological characteristics
of insulin analogues in comparison to insulin in a variety of
cell models, mostly in cancer cells [13, 19, 20, 30–32] and/
or with high doses of the ligands examined (up to two or
three orders of magnitude greater than levels reached in
clinical use) [19, 27, 32–34]. moreover, the investigated
models have been very heterogeneous. in the study of
kurtzhals et al. [13], for instance, receptor binding was
measured with solubilised semi-purified human ir-a,
 xxxg1194xxx  dissociation was measured in transfected
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells overproducing ir (not
indicated whether ir-a or ir-b), metabolic effects were
studied in mouse adipocytes (mouse ir), and mitogenic
potency was evaluated in a human osteosarcoma cell line
producing very little ir (fewer than 1,000 per cell) and high
 xxxg1145xxx  (30,000 per cell). interestingly, in that study,
 xxxd2361xxx , known to be interfered with by albumin, was
studied in the absence of albumin for binding affinity and in
the presence of 1.0%  xxxd100xxx  for metabolic potency
and 0.5% bsa for mitogenic potency. results were then
corrected for the assumed free  xxxd2361xxx  level [13].

discussion
insulin is a growth factor, both in vitro and in vivo. its
mitogenic effect was first believed to occur only at high
concentrations via  xxxg1145xxx , but later it was demonstrated to
occur also at lower concentrations via its own receptor [26].
the mitogenic effect of insulin is influenced by the relative
abundance of receptor expression in target cells [19, 20, 27]
and also by ir isoform prevalence [21, 28, 29].
today, insulin analogues are used in millions of diabetic
patients, although the effects of these analogues at the

as a consequence of the different models studied, the
variability of experimental procedures and the comparison in
each study of some, but not all, insulin analogues, conclusions have been controversial and the molecular differences between analogue signalling poorly defined. in the
present study, we compared with insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  all insulin
analogues in three non-transformed cell models derived from

the same parental cell and producing only the human ir-a,
ir-b or  xxxg1145xxx . these receptors represent a predominantly
metabolic receptor (ir-b), an intermediate metabolic/
mitogenic receptor (ir-a) and a predominantly mitogenic
receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ). in cells producing only one of these
receptors, insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  caused the molecular and
biological effects expected on the basis of present knowledge

[18]. these models, therefore, have the unique property of
enabling comparisons of the molecular and biological
effects stimulated by insulin or its analogues via one
receptor type, avoiding the interference of the other cognate
receptors and providing comparable data for short-acting
and long-acting insulin analogues in the same, nonmalignantly transformed system.
our experimental models and procedures, however, have
some limitations. first, the genetic background of the cells
does not reflect normal human cells, which usually express
all of the three studied receptors (and the derived hybrid
receptors). second, receptors in engineered cells are overproduced in comparison with most normal human cell types,
possibly influencing biological responsiveness. finally, the
ligand concentration used was approximately one order of
magnitude higher than levels reached in clinical use,
although it was lower than in most published studies.
short-acting analogues behave in a way similar, but not
identical, to insulin. although binding affinities to the three
receptors were similar to that of insulin in r−/ir-b cells,
receptor phosphorylation was shorter, and akt and erk
phosphorylation was reduced in comparison with insulin.
by contrast, in r−/ir-a cells, short-acting analogues
induced a more prolonged akt activation, whereas aspart
and lispro, but not glulisine, had a more rapid effect on
erk activation than insulin. maximum stimulation of
intracellular signals for short-acting analogues, however,
was not different from insulin. the short-acting analogues
had effects similar to insulin on  xxxg1145xxx -producing cells.
finally, these analogues had a mitogenic potency similar to
insulin; except glulisine, which stimulated igf1rproducing cell proliferation more than insulin. these results
confirm most previous data obtained in other cell models
and are reassuring in terms of the mitogenic effect of these
analogues. however, the long-term consequences of the
small differences in molecular activation between insulin
and short-acting analogues remain unknown.

at variance with short-acting analogues, long-acting
analogues had marked differences relative to insulin. both
analogues had reduced affinities for ir-a, while affinity for
ir-b was reduced only for  xxxd2361xxx , as already reported
[13, 35], and the affinities of both for  xxxg1145xxx  were higher
than insulin.
in all cell models, long-acting analogues induced a
predominant erk activation: the erk:akt phosphorylation
ratio was clearly increased, as was cell proliferation in
comparison with insulin. in cancer cells long-acting analogues
have been shown to have an increased proliferative effect
relative to insulin [13, 19, 20, 32]. our studies confirm these
observations and clearly indicate that this effect of longacting analogues does not occur only via  xxxg1145xxx  [20, 32, 34]
but also via the irs, especially ir-a. moreover, at variance
with previous studies in non-transformed cells [7, 23, 33, 36]
our study indicates that, when compared with insulin and its
short-acting analogues, long-acting analogues caused increased cell proliferation also in the three non-transformed
cell types examined. it must be considered, however, that our
cell models overexpressed the transfected receptor and their
response may reflect data recently reported in cultured
cancer cells, which often overproduce  xxxg1145xxx  and ir and
specifically ir-a [18].
our data indicate that similar effects are produced by
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx , an observation that is at variance with
some previous reports suggesting a weaker effect of  xxxd2361xxx 
on  xxxg1145xxx  binding and activation and on proliferation
stimulation [13, 20, 23, 32]. comparative studies with
 xxxd2361xxx  are difficult because of its reduced metabolic effect
(and the consequent increased equivalent dose used in
clinical practice), a likely consequence of its high binding
affinity for albumin. when metabolic or mitogenic effects
are studied in the presence of albumin concentrations
higher than 0.1% (like many previous studies), the number
of bioactive  xxxd2361xxx  molecules that can access the receptor
and activate biological signals is greatly reduced and

1752

probably variable, depending on the experimental conditions. we believe this is the reason for most discrepancies
between the present and previous studies.
finally, no insulin analogue, except b10asp, caused
greater anchorage-independent cell growth (a transformation marker) than insulin itself. interestingly, at the
concentration tested, b10asp produced this effect only in
cells producing the a isoform of ir.
in conclusion, in each of the three in vitro models that we
used, each producing only one receptor type, the long-acting
analogues had a significantly increased mitogenic activity
with respect to insulin and short-acting analogues. this
biological effect was consistent with the molecular activation
of receptors and intracellular signalling substrates. our in
vitro observations do not necessarily mimic what happens
when the analogues are used in patients, because different
conditions are present in vivo. for instance,  xxxd2362xxx  insulin
is metabolised to m1 and m2 derivatives [37], and  xxxd2361xxx  is
bound by albumin at concentrations higher than that used in
our studies. moreover, different tissues will respond
differently on the basis of the quantity and the quality of
the receptors produced. therefore, the question of whether
insulin analogues, and specifically long-acting analogues,
have increased mitogenic potency in patients is not
answered by this study. randomised, prospective clinical
studies on this issue are recognised to be difficult because
of the heterogeneity of the diabetic population and the
number of confounding factors associated with the disease,
which are very difficult to correct for in retrospective
observational studies and to normalise in prospective ones.
therefore, the concerns regarding the clinical risk in
patients treated with the long-acting insulin analogues with
increased mitogenic effect are unlikely to be unravelled by
epidemiological studies in the near future [16, 38]. the
disproportionately increased mitogenic effects observed in
vitro provide the biological basis for better directing clinical
as well as pharmacological research and confirm the need
for careful follow-up of patients treated with the long-term
insulin analogues.
