although  xxxd392xxx  is widely used for treatment of
acute migraine, its therapeutic mechanism is poorly understood.  xxxd392xxx  coadministered
with caffeine and
acetaminophen or aspirin provides  xxxd234xxx  to
patients when aspirin or acetaminophen alone or combined with caffeine do not. whether  xxxd392xxx  possesses
an independent analgesic effect, potentiates the actions of
other simple analgesics, and/or simply provides relief via
sedation is not clear.  xxxd392xxx  may exert its effect on pain
through enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric

novemberdecem

with

her; i999

the previous observation that bicuculline, but not the
gaba, receptor antagonist, phaclofen, prevented suppression of c-fos-li by valproate?
there is some
evidence from in vitro investigations that at physiological
conditions of ph and temperature, bicuculline is rapidly
hydrolyzed to less active metabolites including bicucine.18
it may be that bicuculline’s apparent reversal of  xxxd392xxx ’s
effect in this model is, in fact, mediated by these metabolites. further confirming the importance of the gaba,
receptor complex, allopregnanolone
(3a-hydroxy-5apregnan-20-one),
a naturally occurring progesterone
metabolite active at the neurosteroid modulatory site on
the gaba, receptor complex, also attenuates c-fos-li
within the tnc. l4
gaba in pain.-there are several possible sites for
gabaergic pain modulation. these include primary afferent neurons, inter-neurons within the tnc, higher order
neurons within other brain stem nuclei, or supranuclear
sites. populations of trigeminal ganglion cells exhibit
gaba immunoreactivity~9 and express mrna for both
gamma 1 and 2 subunits of the gaba, receptor in rat.20
other immunohistochemical studies reveal high gaba
concentrations within the dorsal horn of the spinal
cord,21j2 a structure which merges with the tnc in the
caudal medulla and functions in pain transmission for
somatic structures in the same way that the tnc subserves
pain for cephalic structures. in addition, relatively high
densities of gaba, and gaba, receptors have been
observed within the superficial laminae of dorsal horn in
both rodents23j4 and humans.25 gaba, binding sites,26 as
well as gaba and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad-t)
immunoreactive terminals, have been identified within the
tnc.2’
there is increasing functional evidence that activity at
gaba receptors affects nociceptive neurotransmission.
using the tail flick latency model of pain, frye and
duncan have demonstrated a direct correlation between
the potency of the antinociceptive effects of progesterone
metabolites and their affinity for the gaba, receptor
complex.28 both gaba, and gaba, receptor subtypes
have been implicated in pain modulation in the spinal
cord. for example, administration of the gaba, agonist,
muscimol, or the gaba, agonist, baclofen, results in a
dose-dependent antagonism of ligation-induced allodynia;
and the anti-allodynic effects of muscimol and baclofen
headache

are reversed by intrathecal pretreatment with the gaba,
antagonist, bicuculline, or the gaba, antagonist, cgp
35348, respectively.29 furthermore, intrathecal administration of gaba, receptor agonists such as isoguvacine and
muscimol30 raise nociceptive thresholds in rodent behavioral models while the gaba, receptor antagonist,
bicuculline, and the convulsant,  xxxd2947xxx ,jl lower pain
thresholds. the gaba, agonist, baclofen, inhibits
mechanically and thermally induced c fiber depolarization in single-unit spinal cord recordings32 as well as
prolongs tail flick latencies in rats.33 latency increases
induced by baclofen are reversed by the gaba, receptor
antagonists, phaclofen33 and cgp 35348.s4
the gabaergic modulation of nociception within the
dorsal horn or tnc may be either presynaptic35 or postsynaptic.
one recent report suggests that gabaergic
fibers presynaptically affect the release of excitatory neurotransmitters within dorsal horn. in this study, glutamate
and aspartate levels were elevated in dialysate from dorsal
horn after sciatic nerve ligation and they correlated with
lowered paw withdrawal latencies. a rise in gaba release
and a transient drop in excitatory amino acids which followed spinal cord stimulation was reversed by a gaba,
antagonist37 on the other hand, liu et al showed that
gaba immunoreactive fibers terminate on enkephalinimmunoreactive cell bodies and dendrites which project to
opioid-containing interneurons within laminae i, 110,and v
of cat dorsal horn .36 the gabaergic neurons via their
inhibition of the inhibitory enkephalin-containing fibers
disinhibit opioid-containing neurons thereby increasing
postsynaptic hyperpolarization of second-order nociresponsive neurons. further investigations are required to
clarify the exact site of  xxxd392xxx ’s suppression of c-fos-li
in the tnc.
gaba also plays a role in nociception at other brain
stem locations. for example, bicuculline delivered iontophoretically
to the rostra1 ventromedial
medulla
eliminates the pause phase of “off cells” which exert a
tonic antinociceptive effect. 38 there is also evidence of
supraspinal modulation of nociceptive input at such sites
as the lateral superior colliculus39 or the ventrobasal thalamus.40
barbiturates in pain.-barbiturates may exert effects
