summary

this study compared the effects of intravenous infusions of phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  on the
prevention of maternal hypotension and neonatal outcome in patients receiving spinal anaesthesia for
caesarean section. sixty asa 1-2 patients with term, uncomplicated singleton pregnancy undergoing
caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided into two groups of 30 each, to
receive a prophylactic intravenous infusion of either phenylephrine or  xxxd2567xxx . the incidence
of hypotension was statistically similar in the two groups. however, in patients receiving
phenylephrine, 7 (23%) developed bradycardia and 6 (20%), reactive hypertension. neonatal outcome, in terms of apgar scores and umbilical artery ph, was similar in both the groups. to conclude,
phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  infusions are equally effective in preventing post spinal hypotension in patients undergoing caesarean section and are associated with a similar neonatal outcome.

the most common complication of spinal anaesthesia
during caesarean section is hypotension with a reported
incidence of up to 80% [1]. administration of vasopressor
drugs is the mainstay of management of post spinal
hypotension [2]. phenylephrine, a pure a agonist, is now
established as a first line vasopressor for management of
spinal induced hypotension during caesarean section [3] as
it is efficacious and is associated with less fetal acidosis
compared with ephedrine. however, the use of phenylephrine is associated with bradycardia and reactive
hypertension [4].
 xxxd2567xxx  is a mixed sympathomimetic amine
that acts both directly and indirectly on a and b adrenergic
receptors. in india, it is widely available and is the most
commonly used vasopressor, despite the availability of
other vasopressors such as ephedrine and phenylephrine,
for the management of spinal induced hypotension.
 xxxd2567xxx  has been shown to be as effective and
safe as ephedrine [5]. however, it has never been compared
with phenylephrine for the prevention of spinal induced
hypotension during caesarean section. the present study
1200

was conducted to compare intravenous infusions of
phenylephrine hydrochloride and  xxxd2567xxx  sulphate for prevention of maternal hypotension and neonatal
outcome in patients receiving spinal anaesthesia for lower
segment caesarean section, and to evaluate if the continued
use of  xxxd2567xxx  in this group of patients, despite
availability of phenylephrine, is justified.
methods

following institutional review board approval, asa 1 or
2 women with term, uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy
scheduled to undergo elective caesarean section under
subarachnoid block were studied. patients suffering from
pregnancy induced hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, placental or fetal abnormalities,
absolute or relative contraindications to spinal anaesthesia
and with systolic blood pressure < 100 mmhg were not
studied.
written informed consent was taken from all patients.
they were asked to fast overnight, and were given oral

ranitidine 150 mg the night before surgery. on the
morning of surgery, ranitidine 50 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg were administered intravenously.
the patients were randomly divided into two groups
of 30 each, using a sealed envelope technique to
determine the drug used for prevention of hypotension.
patients in the ‘phenylephrine group’ received an
infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride, whereas
patients in the ‘ xxxd2567xxx  group’ were administered
an infusion of  xxxd2567xxx  sulphate. equipotent doses
of the two vasopressor drugs were calculated on the basis
of the evidence available in the literature [6, 7].
a potency ratio of 11.9:1 was calculated for phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  and therefore doses of these two
vasopressors were taken in a ratio of 1:12. phenylephrine
2 mg or  xxxd2567xxx  24 mg were diluted in 0.9%
saline to make a total volume of 40 ml, resulting in a
concentration of 50 lg.ml)1 of phenylephrine or
600 lg.ml)1 of  xxxd2567xxx . the solution of vasopressor for infusion was prepared by an assistant who was
not involved in the study, and the investigator as well as
the patient were thus blinded to the identity of
vasopressor used.
hypotension after spinal anaesthesia was defined as a
fall of ‡ 20% from baseline or an absolute value of
< 100 mmhg of systolic blood pressure, whichever was
higher. this value was termed the ‘hypotension value’.
reactive hypertension was defined as a rise in systolic
blood pressure by more than 20% above baseline.
on the operating table, three readings of heart rate and
systolic blood pressure, measured every 2 min with a
standard sized wedge under the right buttock, were
recorded and the average of these was taken as the
baseline value for maternal heart rate and systolic blood
pressure. a large bore intravenous catheter was inserted in
a forearm vein. we pre-loaded patients with 10 ml.kg)1
hartmann’s solution administered over a period of
10–15 min and the infusion was reduced to a rate of
4 ml.kg)1.h)1 thereafter. we administered spinal anaesthesia in the lateral position using a midline approach with
a 25-g quincke needle inserted at the l2-l3 or l3-l4
vertebral interspace, and 2.2 ml hyperbaric 0.5%  xxxd383xxx  was injected. the volume of  xxxd383xxx  was
reduced to 2 ml if the patient’s height was < 150 cm.
the patient was immediately turned supine, the same
wedge used for basal readings was placed under the right
buttock and the prophylactic infusion of vasopressor
started at a rate of 60 ml.h)1 (50 lg.min)1 for phenylephrine and 600 lg.min)1 for  xxxd2567xxx ) using a
syringe infusion pump. if hypotension occurred, a 2-ml
bolus dose of the respective vasopressor solution (100 lg
phenylephrine or 1.2 mg  xxxd2567xxx ) was administered through the infusion pump. if the systolic blood
 2010 the authors

pressure exceeded the baseline value, the infusion rate was
decreased in steps of 6 ml.h)1. the aim was to maintain
systolic blood pressure between the hypotension value
and the baseline value. the number of hypotensive
episodes was noted and the incidence of reactive hypertension was also recorded. bradycardia was defined as a
heart rate < 50 beats.min)1 and was treated with intravenous atropine in increments of 0.3 mg. oxygen was
administered by a clear facemask until delivery. the
upper level of sensory block was assessed in the midline by
pin-prick using a sterile 26-g needle. the aim was to
achieve a minimum sensory block level of t6.
monitoring included continuous ecg, heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry. heart rate
and systolic blood pressure were noted at the start of
spinal anaesthesia and every 2 min thereafter until delivery of the baby. common complications observed during
spinal anaesthesia, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness etc,
were also recorded. nausea and vomiting not associated
with hypotension were treated with an intravenous
injection of ondansetron 4 mg.
the times of spinal injection, uterine incision and
delivery of the baby were recorded. umbilical arterial and
venous blood samples were obtained from a segment of
umbilical cord double-clamped before the baby’s first
breath for immediate blood gas analysis. apgar scores
were recorded at 1 and 5 min after birth. the study
period continued until delivery of the baby.
prospective power analysis was based on potential
differences in umbilical cord blood gases using data from
normal deliveries [8]. according to this, 22 patients per
group would be required to give 90% power at the 5%
significance level to detect a difference in umbilical
arterial ph of 0.05 units. however, to compensate for
possible patient withdrawals, 30 patients were recruited in
each group. statistical analysis was performed using spss
version 17.0 (chicago, il, usa). continuous variables
were compared between the two groups by unpaired
student’s t-test. ordinal data were analysed using the
mann–whitney non-parametric test. for qualitative data,
either chi-square test or fisher’s exact test was used. two
factor, repeated measures anova with one factor as a
fixed group and the other as a repeated factor (i.e. time)
was used to compare the variability between the subjects.
mauchly’s test was used for checking sphericity. if found
significant, the greenhouse geisser correction was used
to find the p value within time points. the value of
p < 0.05 was considered significant.

following atropine administration were not studied for
the analysis. the mean birth weights in the two groups
and the apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were comparable in
both groups. none of the neonates in either group had
apgar score < 7 at 1 or 5 min. umbilical arterial and
venous blood gas analyses were similar in the two groups.
none of the patients in either group developed fetal
acidosis i.e. umbilical arterial ph < 7.2.
in contrast to one patient vomiting in the phenylephrine group, two patients complained of nausea and one
patient vomited in the  xxxd2567xxx  group during the
study period (ns). no other complications related to
spinal anaesthesia were observed in either of the groups.
discussion

the results of our study suggest that  xxxd2567xxx  is
as effective as phenylephrine in preventing maternal
hypotension following spinal anaesthesia and also has a
similar effect on neonatal outcome.
the potency ratio of  xxxd2567xxx  and phenylephrine
remains unknown, as these two drugs have never been
compared for prevention of post spinal hypotension. in a
previous study,  xxxd2567xxx  was found to be more
potent than ephedrine and the potency ratio of ephedrine vs
 xxxd2567xxx  was reported as 1:6.8 (95% ci 6.0–7.5) [6].
saravanan et al. [7] demonstrated a potency ratio of 81.2:1
(95% ci 73–89.7) for equivalence between phenylephrine
and ephedrine in prevention of hypotension after spinal
anaesthesia for caesarean section. from the potency ratios of
phenylephrine vs ephedrine [7] and ephedrine vs  xxxd2567xxx  [6], we derived the relative potency of phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  as 11.9:1. therefore, we used
doses of phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  in a ratio of
1:12 (2 mg phenylephrine and 24 mg  xxxd2567xxx ).
the vasopressor protocol used in the present study was
modified from the protocol used in our previous studies [6,
9], where  xxxd2567xxx  and ephedrine were administered as infusions at the rate of 40 ml.h)1 and the systolic
blood pressure exceeding the baseline value was managed
by decreasing the infusion rate in steps of 4 ml.h)1 i.e. 1 ⁄ 10
of the initial infusion rate. in the present study, a rate of
60 ml.h)1 was used to give the optimum doses of the
vasopressors. at this rate, phenylephrine was administered
at a rate of 50 lg.min)1 and in the event of hypotension, a
2-ml bolus containing 100 lg was given, which is the most
commonly used dose of phenylephrine for treatment of
hypotension. the doses of  xxxd2567xxx  infusion and
bolus for treatment of hypotension were calculated to be
600 lg.min)1 and 1.2 mg respectively, based on the
derived potency ratio of the two drugs.
in the present study, while using the above vasopressor
protocol, phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  performed
 2010 the authors
anaesthesia  2010 the association of anaesthetists of great britain and ireland

similarly in preventing hypotension. however, the patients
in the phenylephrine group had a high incidence of
bradycardia (23%) and reactive hypertension (20%). other
workers have also reported bradycardia [4, 10] and reactive
hypertension [4, 10, 11] with phenylephrine. bradycardia is
most likely to reflect a physiological baroreceptor reflex.
ngan kee et al. [10] compared phenylephrine infusion
regimens based on different systolic blood pressure thresholds. they reported bradycardia in 8–32% patients and
hypertension in 16–24% patients with different phenylephrine doses. allen et al. [4] administered prophylactic
phenylephrine infusions at rates of 0, 25, 50, 75 or
100 lg.min)1 immediately after spinal anaesthesia. the
incidence of bradycardia in their study varied from 5% to
32%. they had to stop the infusion to manage reactive
hypertension in 68% of patients receiving 100 lg.min)1
and in 15% of patients receiving 50 lg.min)1. magalhaes
and co-workers [11] injected phenylephrine as an 80-lg
bolus immediately after spinal anaesthesia for prevention of
hypotension and reported four episodes of reactive hypertension in 30 patients.
in our study, the phenylephrine infusion had to be
stopped in two patients who developed uncontrolled
hypertension following administration of atropine. allen
et al. [4] also faced a similar problem when two of their
patients developed hypertension following administration
of  xxxd2220xxx  for treatment of bradycardia. because
of the double-blind nature of our study, we had to follow
the same protocol for patients receiving both vasopressors.
however, we fully agree with and support the suggestion
of allen et al. that in patients receiving a phenylephrine
infusion,  xxxd2220xxx  or atropine should be administered only in patients with bradycardia associated with
hypotension. other patients with bradycardia should be
managed by reducing the rate or completely stopping the
phenylephrine infusion.
 xxxd2567xxx  is n-methylphenyl-tertiary butylamine sulphate. its molecule consists of an aromatic ring
attached to a tertiary butylamino compound. it differs
from ephedrine by the presence of an additional methyl
group on the a-carbon atom of the aliphatic chain and the
absence of the hydroxyl group [12]. the mechanism of
action of  xxxd2567xxx  is similar to that of ephedrine. it
is an a- as well as b-adrenergic receptor agonist. it acts
both directly and indirectly by releasing noradrenaline
from storage sites [13]. it increases blood pressure mainly
by augmenting cardiac output [14]. the change in heart
rate is variable depending on the degree of vagal tone
[13].  xxxd2567xxx  was found to preserve uterine
artery blood flow velocity in gravid guinea pigs subjected
to  xxxd3130xxx  infusion [15]. being very similar to ephedrine,  xxxd2567xxx  would be expected to cross the
placenta to a similar extent as ephedrine. however, not

much information is available in the literature regarding
its placental transfer and fetal metabolic effects. unlike
ephedrine,  xxxd2567xxx  has not been reported to
increase the incidence of fetal acidosis.
in india, phenylephrine is available as a single-use 10-mg
ampoule, whereas  xxxd2567xxx  is marketed as both a
10-ml multidose vial containing 30 mg.ml)1  xxxd2567xxx  and a single-use 1-ml ampoule containing
15 mg.ml)1  xxxd2567xxx . the cost of one 10-mg
ampoule of phenylephrine is approximately rupees 200
(£2.8; €3.2; $4.5). although phenylephrine can be
prepared by diluting one ampoule into a small bag of saline
and dividing the contents into separate syringes, these
syringes cannot be stored for long and should be used
within a few hours. thus, the cost-effectiveness of
phenylephrine in such situations depends on the number
of caesarean sections conducted during that time period.
on the other hand, the single-use ampoule of  xxxd2567xxx  costs rupees 18, thus costing a maximum of rupees
36 (£0.5; €0.6; $0.8) per patient, if 24 mg of drug is used
according to our protocol. if a multidose vial costing
rupees 150 is used, the cost of  xxxd2567xxx  per patient
works out to be about rupees 15 (£0.2; €0.2; $0.3).
thus, use of  xxxd2567xxx  is much more economical
than using phenylephrine.
this study has certain limitations. blood pressure was
measured at 2-min intervals throughout the study period.
this may have contributed to the high incidence of
reactive hypertension found in this study. measuring
systolic blood pressure and titrating the phenylephrine
infusion at 1-min intervals might have reduced this
incidence. another limitation of this study was the use of
an indirectly derived value of potency ratio of phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx  as no study has been
conducted to derive this value directly. although our
calculations were based on the evidence available in the
literature, the equipotent ratio may not have been very
accurate and may have influenced the results.
in conclusion, phenylephrine and  xxxd2567xxx , in a
dose ratio of 1:12 and using the infusion regimen
described by us, are equally efficacious in preventing post
spinal hypotension in patients undergoing caesarean
section and are associated with similar neonatal outcome.
however, in india,  xxxd2567xxx  appears to be more
cost-effective than phenylephrine. thus, continued use of
 xxxd2567xxx  in india, despite availability of other
vasopressors, appears to be justified. further studies are
required to calculate equipotent doses of  xxxd2567xxx 
and phenylephrine.
