differential inhibition of t-type calcium channels by neuroleptics.  t-type calcium channels play critical roles in cellular excitability and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurological disorders including epilepsy. although there have been reports that certain neuroleptics that primarily target d2 dopamine receptors and are used to treat psychoses may also interact with t-type ca channels, there has been no systematic examination of this phenomenon. in the present paper we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of several widely used neuroleptic agents on a family of exogenously expressed neuronal t-type ca channels (alpha1g, alpha1h, and alpha1i subtypes). among the neuroleptics tested, the diphenylbutylpiperidines  xxxd2956xxx  and penfluridol were the most potent t-type channel blockers with kd values (approximately 30-50 nm and approximately 70-100 nm, respectively), in the range of their antagonism of the d2 dopamine receptor. in contrast, the butyrophenone haloperidol was approximately 12- to 20-fold less potent at blocking the various t-type ca channels. the diphenyldiperazine  xxxd2125xxx  was also less potent compared with the diphenylbutylpiperadines and preferentially blocked alpha1g and alpha1i t-type channels compared with alpha1h. the various neuroleptics did not significantly affect t-type channel activation or kinetic properties, although they shifted steady-state inactivation profiles to more negative values, indicating that these agents preferentially bind to channel inactivated states. overall, our findings indicate that t-type ca channels are potently blocked by a subset of neuroleptic agents and suggest that the action of these drugs on t-type ca channels may significantly contribute to their therapeutic efficacy.
