in order to shorten the list of candidate drugs with anticonvulsant potential against nerve agents, critical
subreceptors in seizure controlling brain regions should be speciﬁed. epileptiform activity does not
spread randomly throughout the brain, but appears to be generated and propagated by speciﬁc
anatomical routes. nerve agents evoke seizure activity in the forebrain that progresses to the hind brain
resulting in tonic-clonic convulsions. in some recent studies, it was shown that lesion of the area
tempestas (at), medial septum (ms), perirhinal cortex (prc), or posterior piriform cortex (ppc) produces
anticonvulsant effects (prevention of convulsions or delayed onset of convulsions) in rats exposed to
soman, whereas damage to nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, amygdala,
hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex does not cause anticonvulsant impact. these results are in
compliance with ﬁndings that seizures can be generated in at, ms, prc, and ppc by means of nerve
agents, chemoconvulsants, or kindling. results from microinfusion studies show that anticonvulsant
efﬁcacy is obtained by gabaa modulators or cholinergic antagonists (m1–m5) in at, cholinergic
antagonists (m1–m5) in ms, combined glutamatergic (nmda) and cholinergic antagonist (m1–m4),
ampa antagonist, or modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors ( xxxg974xxx , mglur2/3) in prc, and
cholinergic antagonist (m1–m5) or gabaa agonist in ppc. calculation of impact factors for the most
potent drugs (percentage of positive effects in the seizure controlling sites) showed that scopolamine
and  xxxd3019xxx  were ranking highest (75) followed by muscimol (50), nbqx (33), and caramiphen (33).
potential strategies for prophylactic and post-exposure treatments are discussed.

acetylcholine. accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft
results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. this
cholinergic over-activity can affect all organ systems. the toxic signs
include hyper-salivation, respiratory distress, tremor, seizures/
convulsions, coma, and death (taylor, 2001). if the seizure activity is
not terminated within 20 min, neuropathology can develop, because
neuronal damage is associated with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (lallement et al., 1994a; mcdonough et al., 1995).

exposure to nerve agents requires immediate medical treatment. for this purpose, military personnel are issued with
autoinjectors containing countermeasures for self-administration
or ‘‘buddy aid’’. antidotes against nerve agents are based on drugs
acting at the muscarinic receptors and gabaa receptors (mcdonough and shih, 1997). in addition, partial protection against nerve
agents can be obtained by the use of reversible (carbamate)
acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors shielding a portion of ache
from irreversible inhibition by nerve agents prior to nerve agent
exposure. furthermore, reactivation of any unaged ache by an
oxime is regarded as important immediate treatment after nerve
agent exposure.
it has been hypothesized that several neurotransmitter systems
probably become involved sequentially in the initiation and
maintenance of seizures elicited by nerve agents (mcdonough and
shih, 1997). the progression of events can be divided into 3 phases.
an early cholinergic phase lasting from the time of exposure to
about 5 min after onset of seizures is dominated by high
cholinergic activity followed by a transitional phase of cholinergic
and glutamatergic hyperactivity and ﬁnally a predominantly
glutamatergic phase after about 40 min (mcdonough and shih,
1997).
in a majority of nerve agent studies, soman has been used in
animal models to evaluate potential anticonvulsant drugs. the
reason for this is that a higher dose of anticonvulsants is required
to terminate seizures induced by soman than by other classical
nerve agents (tabun, sarin, cyclosarin, vx). this ﬁnding suggests
that drugs effective against soman will also be effective against
other nerve agents (shih and mcdonough, 2000). in the latter
study, it was shown that soman, tabun, sarin, cyclosarin, vx, and
vr in most cases can evoke seizure activity when given at toxic
doses (2  ld50) in guinea pigs. however, for the sake of
comparison and the need to limit the extent of the present study
it will be focused on neuropharmacological mechanisms of somaninduced seizures.
soman-induced seizures that have lasted more than 10 min
seem to be difﬁcult to terminate unless the countermeasures exert
cholinergic and glutamatergic antagonism as well as gabaergic
agonism (mcdonough and shih, 1997). it will take at least 30 min
for emergency personnel to access individuals unprepared for
exposure to nerve agent. furthermore, even soldiers properly
provided with protective mask, gloves and clothes may need
medical help, because bad training, bad discipline or bad luck can
lead to intoxication of nerve agent (cf. lallement et al., 1999). thus,
there has been an urgent need for strategies capable of terminating
soman-induced seizures 30–40 min following onset. it has been
demonstrated that a triple regimen consisting of  xxxd3019xxx 
(6 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg), and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) can
effectively terminate soman-induced seizures in rats when
administered intraperitoneally 5 min apart 30–40 min following
onset, but without preventing some neuropathology in the
majority of rats (myhrer et al., 2003). a reﬁnement of the triple
regimen resulted in a double regimen composed of  xxxd3019xxx 
(10 mg/kg) and propofol (50 mg/kg) that can stop soman-evoked
seizures when given 30–35 min after onset (myhrer et al., 2006a).
however, both the triple and double regimens would need
monitoring of vital functions, because pentobarbital and propofol
can suppress normal function of the respiratory center in the
brainstem. thus, alternative approaches making it possible to
design anticonvulsants predominantly affecting the forebrain will
be needed. the ultimate aim should be to develop well tolerated
anticonvulsants that can be administered by the soldiers
themselves.
in epilepsy research, great emphasis has been put on
identiﬁcation of seizure controlling brain sites. epileptiform
activity does not spread randomly throughout the brain, but the

discharges seem to be generated and propagated by speciﬁc
anatomical pathways (gale, 1988; löscher and ebert, 1996). in
epilepsy models, epileptiform activity is usually recruited in
structures localized in the ventrolateral forebrain of rats (mcintyre,
2006). if not terminated, such partial epileptiform activity
propagates to the motor cortex by way of the perirhinal cortex
and clonic convulsions will occur (mcintyre, 2006). if the activity
reaches a sufﬁciently high intensity level, electrical discharges
spread further to the brainstem by way of the basal ganglia, and
generalized seizures accompanied by tonic-clonic convulsions are
seen (browning and nelson, 1986) (fig. 1a). the tonic extension of
hind limbs likely reﬂects the level of seizure activity involving both
the forebrain and brainstem (swinyard, 1973). nerve agentgenerated seizures appear to be complex partial seizures evolving
to secondarily generalized seizures accompanied by tonic-clonic
convulsions (myhrer, 2007). as an example, tonic-clonic convulsions in rats can be evoked by unilateral microinfusion of vx into
the amygdala (mcdonough et al., 1987).
it has been shown in experimental epilepsy that within the rat
brain there are control mechanisms capable of attenuating all
aspects of convulsive activity. several target areas have been
identiﬁed, and it is assumed that the ability of a systemically
administered drug to confer seizure protection depends on the
drug’s relative impact on the deﬁned action sites (gale, 1988). the
ﬁrst purpose of the present study was to consider results from
lesion studies devoted to the identiﬁcation of neuronal target areas
for nerve agents as well as results from related epilepsy studies.
the second purpose was to make comparative assessments of
results from microinfusion studies in order to achieve deeper
insights into the neuropharmacological mechanisms pertinent for
therapies against nerve agent intoxication. this meta-analysis is
carried out in various steps by initially reviewing lesion studies
from both nerve agent and epilepsy research. then follow reviews
of microinfusion studies of nerve agents and other chemoconvulsants along with studies of kindling. finally, results from

microinfusion of pharmacological agents into identiﬁed target
areas are assessed for speciﬁcation of receptors for designing drugs
with optimal anticonvulsant efﬁcacy against nerve agent-triggered
seizures.
in experimental epilepsy, seizure controlling brain areas have
been identiﬁed by means of lesions, microinfusions of chemical
substances, and electrical stimulation of selective target areas
(löscher and ebert, 1996). the areas identiﬁed are the substantia
nigra pars reticulata, area tempestas, posterior piriform cortex,
perirhinal cortex, and subthalamic nucleus (dybdal and gale,
2000; gale, 1988; halonen et al., 1994; tortorella et al., 1997).
according to the results from 2 lesion studies and 5 microinfusion
studies to be presented in this review, the area tempestas, medial
septum, perirhinal cortex, and posterior piriform cortex act as
control regions for soman-induced seizures. hence, the area
tempestas, perirhinal cortex, and posterior piriform cortex have
been identiﬁed as seizure controlling brain sites in both epilepsy
research and nerve agent research. the similarities and differences
between the results from epilepsy and nerve agent models will be
highlighted in the present study.
2. lesions and anticonvulsant impact
mapping of target areas for nerve agents can be carried out in
various ways. potential trigger sites for seizures and/or propagation may be identiﬁed by microinfusion of nerve agents, related
chemoconvulsants, or anticonvulsant drugs in animals exposed to
a convulsant dose of nerve agent. however, for the initial screening
of target areas selective ablation of relevant brain structures may
be the most pertinent choice. if selective damage to an area assures
anticonvulsant effects against nerve agent intoxication, the area
affected may serve as a trigger site for seizures or may make up an
important link in the propagation of seizure activity. thus, the
constellation of receptor types in the damaged region may provide
clues for designing drugs with powerful anticonvulsant properties.
the candidate structures are those containing large assemblies of
cholinergic neurons and areas demonstrated to have control
capabilities in experimental epilepsy. among structures giving rise
to cholinergic projections, aspiration lesion of the medial septum
causes prevention or increased latency to onset of convulsions,
whereas damage to the nucleus basalis magnocellularis or nucleus
accumbens does not have anticonvulsant effects in rats exposed to
a convulsant dose of soman (1.3  ld50) (myhrer et al., 2007). rats
with aspiration lesion of the seizure controlling substrate area
tempestas in the anterior piriform cortex display marked
anticonvulsant impact, whereas such effect is not seen when the
substantia nigra is destroyed (myhrer et al., 2007) (fig. 1b). similar
lesions made in the perirhinal cortex or posterior piriform cortex
produce anticonvulsant efﬁcacy against soman intoxication, but
anticonvulsant impact is not achieved when lesions are made in
the entorhinal cortex, hippocampal region, or amygdala (myhrer
et al., 2008b) (fig. 1b).
the results outlined in fig. 1b are in compliance with ﬁndings
from studies of neuroanatomical tracking and neuropathology
following exposure to nerve agent as well as data from epilepsy
research. the proto-oncogen c-fos has been used as marker of
activated cell bodies in rats exposed to a convulsant dose of soman
(denoyer et al., 1992; zimmer et al., 1997). this staining technique
makes it possible to determine what structures have initially been
activated by nerve agent and thus indicates potential trigger sites
for seizure induction. in a study with differentiated survival times
after onset of soman-evoked seizures, a time related pattern of
c-fos staining was revealed. robust labelling was observed in layer
ii of the piriform cortex and locus coeruleus within 30–45 min. by
1 h, staining was more intense in the same layer, and additionally
occurred in layer iii of the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex,

631

septum, and endopiriform nucleus. by 2 h, c-fos staining was
present throughout the cortical areas, thalamus, striatum, and
hippocampus (zimmer et al., 1997). this time course of c-fos
expression appears to differentiate more clearly among brain
structures than the time course seen by the inhibition of ache in
response to soman (zimmer et al., 1997). on the other hand, it can
be hypothesized that brain structures with the earliest and most
severe signs of neuropathology may be the key sites for the
initiation of seizures. in correspondence with the time course of
c-fos staining, damage is most frequently observed in the piriform
cortex followed by the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, cortical
areas, and striatum (mcdonough et al., 1995). these ﬁndings
suggest the piriform cortex as a trigger site for soman-induced
seizures.
in experimental epilepsy, it has been demonstrated that in rats
with complete piriform cortical lesions secondarily generalized
kindled seizures from the hippocampus still exist. however, more
extensive damage also comprising the perirhinal cortex results in
blocking of the seizure expression (kelly et al., 2002). kindling is
characterized by the progressive development of electrographic
and behavioral seizure activity following the spaced, repeated
application of low-intensity electrical stimulation (mcintyre and
kelly, 2000). the amygdala and piriform cortex are very sensitive
to kindling, but the anterior perirhinal cortex is the fastest known
kindling site in the rat brain (mcintyre et al., 1993; mcintyre and
kelly, 2000). the negative ﬁnding from ablation of the amygdala
may occur somewhat surprising in view of amygdala’s high
sensitivity to kindling (mcintyre et al., 1993) and seizurogenic
sensitivity to microinfusions of vx, but not soman (mcdonough
et al., 1987). however, microinfusion of atropine into the amygdala
does not cause anticonvulsant effects against soman (myhrer and
enger, unpublished data). the negative ﬁnding with hippocampal
lesions may not occur unexpected, since this structure is one of the
slowest kindling sites and not critical for either septal or
amygdaloid kindling (racine et al., 1988) and among the least
sensitive areas to microinfusion of vx (mcdonough and shih,
1997). furthermore, activation of the hippocampus is not
necessary for induction of focal seizures in the amygdala or
piriform cortex kindling (ebert and löscher, 1995). the entorhinal
cortex is intermediately sensitive to vx (mcdonough and shih,
1997), but lesion of this structure has no effect on amygdaloid
kindling (racine et al., 1988). in nerve agent research, the medial
septum has been identiﬁed as a seizure controlling site. microinfusions of atropine into the medial septal area have anticonvulsant effects on rats challenged with soman (denoyer et al., 1992;
lallement et al., 1992; myhrer et al., 2009). hence, additional data
give support to the ﬁndings presented in fig. 1b that the anterior
(area tempesteas) and posterior piriform cortex along with the
perirhinal cortex and medial septum make up target areas for
nerve agent-evoked seizure activity.
3. target areas and seizure generation
table 1 gives an overview of how seizures can be generated in
the brain areas identiﬁed as target areas for nerve agents. the
results presented are from both nerve agent research and epilepsy
research. in area tempestas, soman induces seizures in 20% of the
animals, whereas preconvulsive reactions are observed in the
others. the medial septum appears to be the least sensitive
structure, since only preconvulsive responses are obtained.
repeated injections of vx cause hyperactivity. a single infusion
of soman results in wet dog shakes along with frenetic jumping
bouts. in the perirhinal and piriform cortices, seizures are obtained
in 75% of the animals. both glutamatergic and cholinergic agonists
and gabaergic antagonist can generate seizures in area tempestas.
in the medial septum, seizures are evoked by affecting opioid

receptors involved in regulation of cholinergic activity. the potent
glutamatergic agonist, kainic acid, induces seizures in the
perirhinal cortex, whereas corresponding reaction is triggered
by the gabaergic antagonist, bicuculline, in the piriform cortex.
the kindling technique generates seizures in all 4 brain areas. the
perirhinal cortex is known to kindle faster than any other
structure, and this area has direct projections to the frontal motor
cortex in rats (mcintyre and kelly, 2000). according to the results
presented in table 1, there exists substantial evidence in support of
the notion that the area tempestas, medial septum, perirhinal
cortex, and piriform cortex represent particularly seizurogenic
brain regions.
4. target areas and microinfusion of anticonvulsants
we have performed 5 studies of microinfusion of pharmacological agents with potential anticonvulsant properties in the brain
areas that have been identiﬁed as target sites for generation of
seizures (table 2). the application of identical procedures in these
studies justiﬁes direct comparison of results.

in the area tempestas, some antiparkinson drugs (benactyzine,
biperiden, trihexyphenidyl) do not produce anticonvulsant effects,
even when the doses were radically increased (myhrer et al.,
2008a). similarly, the dose of pentobarbital was increased,
whereas the dose of diazepam that does not produce positive
effect has been shown to ensure anticonvulsant impact when
infused into the substantia nigra (myhrer et al., 2006b). the
negative result of nbqx (myhrer and enger, unpublished data) was
based on the same dose that was used in the perirhinal cortex
(myhrer et al., 2010a). in the latter structure, various doses of
metabotropic glutamate modulators were used. microinfusion
doses of drugs shown to produce optimal anticonvulsant efﬁcacy in
experimental epilepsy were used when accessible. otherwise, 1
microinfusion dose derived from drug doses previously demonstrated to ensure anticonvulsant efﬁcacy in systemic nerve agent
studies was applied in the medial septum, perirhinal cortex, and
posterior piriform cortex (myhrer et al., 2009, 2010a). the

procedure for anticonvulsant effects of microinfusion of scopolamine (0.91 mg/ml) or mk-801 (1.11 mg/ml) into the area
tempestas in rats exposed to sarin (skovira et al., 2010) (table
2). table 2 shows the results from the microinfusion studies. it did
not turn out as a surprise that muscarinic receptors appear to be
critical in all brain regions, but there are distinct differences among
other receptor types. only general muscarinic binding properties
are presented; they are not related to speciﬁc brain structures. in
area tempestas, cholinergic, and not glutamatergic antagonism is
likely the active property of the antiparkinson agents, caramiphen
and  xxxd3019xxx , since the nmda antagonists ketamine and mk801 do not have anticonvulsant effects (myhrer et al., 2008a). the
gabaa modulators muscimol, ethanol, and propofol produce
anticonvulsant effects, whereas diazepam and pentobarbital do
not (myhrer et al., 2006b). in the medial septum, only muscarinic
receptors seem to be the effective ones, because ketamin and
muscimol do not produce anticonvulsant effects (myhrer et al.,
2009). in the perirhinal cortex, the picture appears somewhat more
complex. both muscarinic and glutamatergic receptors have to be
blocked simultaneously ( xxxd3019xxx ) in order to achieve anticonvulsant effect. neither scopolamine alone nor ketamine alone
causes anticonvulsant effects (myhrer et al., 2010a). the positive
effect of nbqx suggests that ampa receptors are critical for
anticonvulsant impact in the perirhinal cortex (myhrer et al.,
2010a). caramiphen is supposed to exert ampa antagonism
(raveh et al., 2002), but it might be too weak in this respect. the
central roles of nmda and ampa receptors in this area suggest that
there is increased glutamatergic activity already during the
cholinergic phase. this view receives further support from the
ﬁndings that modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mglurs) in the perirhinal cortex also has anticonvulsant effects.
injection of mpep (antagonizing  xxxg974xxx ) or dcg-iv (agonistic
effect on both mglur2 and 3) results in marked anticonvulsant
efﬁcacy, whereas ly367385 (antagonizing  xxxg972xxx ) has no
anticonvulsant effect (myhrer et al., 2010b). thus, the perirhinal
cortex may be a likely site for recruiting the glutamatergic phase of
the 3-phase model. in the posterior piriform cortex, muscarinic and
gabaa receptors seem to be the critical ones. this constellation of
receptors has similarity to area tempestas located in the anterior
piriform cortex, and might indicate a general feature of the
piriform cortex. according to the present results, efﬁcient
anticonvulsant pretreatment has to be based on pharmacological
agents affecting a number of subreceptors, and this picture is most
likely not complete. also post-exposure treatment will probably
proﬁt by using similar agents.
5. relative anticonvulsant impact of drugs and lesions
in principle, pharmacological manipulation of neurotransmitter
activation may be expected to have more potent anticonvulsant
efﬁcacy than mere disruption of neuronal pathways by lesions.

633

table 3 shows an overview of the percentages of nonconvulsing
rats (full protection against soman-induced seizures) as an
indicator of anticonvulsant potency of drugs microinfused into
the target areas relative to lesions in the same areas. among these
areas, the area tempestas and perirhinal cortex appear to be the
most critical ones.
in area tempestas, very efﬁcient protection against soman
intoxication is obtained by the gabaergic agonists muscimol,
ethanol, and propofol (myhrer et al., 2006b). it is further observed
that the anticholinergic potency is higher for atropine and
scopolamine than  xxxd3019xxx  and caramiphen, because combined percentages of nonconvulsing rats for these groups of drugs
are 67 and 19, respectively (myhrer et al., 2008a). infusion of 1 ml
of 4%  xxxd2610xxx  in saline (0.9%) into the temporal or
entorhinal cortex invades an area of about 1 mm3 (myhrer and
andersen, 2001). the area tempestas is somewhat more than
1 mm in diameter (piredda and gale, 1985) and the average extent
of the area tempestas lesions is 74% (myhrer et al., 2007). hence,
the tissue affected in the area tempestas by microinfusions
and lesions is probably similar. the results presented in table 3
indicate that infusion of the most effective drugs has more
powerful anticonvulsant impact than lesions in the area
tempestas.
in the medial septum, none of the drugs that ensure
anticonvulsant effects by microinfusion produce full protection
against soman-generated seizures (myhrer et al., 2009). even if the
lesion of this area is nearly complete (82%), only 14% of the rats are
fully protected (myhrer et al., 2007). thus, the medial septum does
not appear to be a particularly sensitive target area for
pharmacological inﬂuence.
in the perirhinal cortex, only the metabotropic glutamate
modulators protect against seizure onset. the glutamatergic
nmda antagonism along with cholinergic antagonism ( xxxd3019xxx ) is not sufﬁcient to prevent onset of epileptiform activity
(myhrer et al., 2010a). perirhinal lesions seem to produce
somewhat more powerful anticonvulsant impact than metabotropic glutamate modulators. however, while the average extent of
perirhinal lesions is 74% (myhrer et al., 2008b), the microinfusions
only affect 7% of this structure (myhrer et al., 2010a). the anterior
portion affected in the latter study seems to be the most strategic
one, because that is the site of origin of the direct projections to the
frontal motor cortex (mcintyre et al., 1996). nevertheless, a larger
percentage of animals fully protected against seizures might have
been achieved if the infusions had invaded a more extensive area of
the perirhinal cortex. such an attempt has been made by the
administration of double infusions in each hemisphere. however,
the mere implantation of 2 bilateral guide cannulas in the
perirhinal cortex results in proconvulsant effects (myhrer and
enger, unpublished data). this ﬁnding may be associated with the
intricate nature of the perirhinal cortex. this structure is provided
with intrinsic excitability and synaptic connectivity to be highly

inﬂuential in the development and maintenance of temporal lobe
seizure activity (kelly and mcintyre, 1996).
in the posterior piriform cortex, the lesions affect an average of
75% without preventing convulsions (myhrer et al., 2008b).
neither of the drugs infused protect against seizure onset (myhrer
et al., 2010a). hence, the anticonvulsant potency of the posterior
piriform cortex appears to be relatively low.
6. seizure controlling properties of identiﬁed brain regions
the results from the present meta-analysis show that the area
tempestas and perirhinal cortex likely possess more potent seizure
controlling abilities than the medial septum and posterior piriform
cortex. according to knowledge acquired in experimental epilepsy,
the anticonvulsant potency of systemically administered drugs
depends on their capability to affect critical seizure controlling
regions (gale, 1988). thus, clues for designing more efﬁcacious
anticonvulsant drugs against nerve agent poisoning may be found
in the area tempestas and perirhinal cortex.
the area tempestas has been deﬁned morphologically and
termed the pre-endopiriform nucleus (ekstrand et al., 2001). the
area tempestas receives cholinergic input from the diagonal band
nucleus of the septal area (woolf et al., 1984) and is provided with
both gabaergic and glutamatergic intrinsic connections, whereas
the output is glutamatergic (doherty et al., 2000; gale, 1988;
halonen et al., 1994). as seen from table 2, anticonvulsant effects
against soman intoxication were obtained by cholinergic antagonism and gabaergic agonism, but not by glutamatergic antagonism. in epilepsy research, it has been shown that seizures evoked
by infusion of carbachol into the area tempetas can be antagonized
by nmda antagonist as well as cholinergic antagonist on
subsequent infusion into the same area (piredda and gale,
1985). the discrepant effects of nmda antagonist in the area
tempestas may be associated with focal induction of seizures in the
latter study and global (systemic) generation of seizures in the
study referred to in table 2, or simply different abilities of
carbachol and soman to trigger seizures.
both the perirhinal cortex and posterior piriform cortex receive
cholinergic inputs from the septal diagonal band nucleus (woolf
et al., 1984). however, the cholinergic input to the posterior
piriform cortex is far more extensive than the input to the
perirhinal cortex, although the input to the latter structure is more
evident than the dorsally located neocortical areas, as reﬂected in
the ache stained plates in the atlas of paxinos and watson (1982).
a critical link from the area tempestas is represented by
glutamatergic projections to the perirhinal cortex and posterior
piriform cortex (halonen et al., 1994). the posterior piriform
cortical connections with the perirhinal cortex (burwell and
amaral, 1998) are likely glutamatergic, since glutamate is used as
neurotransmitter by  xxxd1751xxx -cortical pathways (fonnum, 1984).
furthermore, the perirhinal cortex has direct projections to the
frontal motor cortex (mcintyre et al., 1996) that most likely are
glutamatergic (myhrer, 2007). hence, it appears that the posterior
piriform cortex is more dominated by cholinergic input than the
perirhinal cortex in which more balanced inputs of both
cholinergic and glutamatergic nature may be present. this
potential constellation of neurochemical systems may explain
why scopolamine is effective in the posterior piriform cortex and
not in the perirhinal cortex, whereas  xxxd3019xxx  and nbqx are
effective in the perirhinal cortex and not in the posterior piriform
cortex.
the metabotropic glutamate receptors consist of group i
( xxxg972xxx ,  xxxg974xxx ), group ii (mglur2, mglur3), and group iii
( xxxg973xxx , mglur6,  xxxg975xxx ,  xxxg976xxx ). all groups are present in the
perirhinal cortex of the rat (mccaffery et al., 1999). modulators of
group i and ii have been demonstrated to ensure anticonvulsant

efﬁcacy in epilepsy research, whereas group iii modulators have
mixed responses in animal models of epilepsy (alexander and
godwin, 2006). as seen from table 3, modulators of group i (mpep)
or ii (dcg-iv) can prevent onset of seizures in 25% of the animals
exposed to soman.
it has recently been suggested that glutamatergic pathways are
intimately involved in the early stages of soman-evoked seizure
activity (weissman and raveh, 2008). both scopolamine and
caramiphen prevent the lethal effect of soman when given as
prophylactic drugs to rats. however, only caramiphen exerts
signiﬁcant actions as nmda antagonist by abolishing somaninduced modiﬁcations in nmda/ion channel characteristics
(raveh et al., 1999). in an extension of the latter study, it was
shown that caramiphen, but not scopolamine, also can block
soman-evoked modiﬁcation of the ampa receptors in the forebrain
of rats. caramiphen can protect against early increase in
glutamatergic activity resulting in normal performances in the
water maze 1 week after soman exposure, whereas rats pretreated
with scopolamine display cognitive deﬁcits (raveh et al., 2002). it
appears that an early activation of glutamate receptors may occur
along with the initial cholinergic phase of the 3-phase model. the
exact mechanisms involved in the stimulation of glutamate release
and activation of glutamatergic pathways are yet unclear (weissman and raveh, 2008). according to the results presented in table
2, such glutamatergic pathways are probably not globally activated
in the neuronal network. increased glutamatergic activity in
response to soman intoxication appears to be locally represented
in seizure controlling regions as found for the perirhinal cortex and
not the area tempestas.
seizure activity generated by bicuculline into the area
tempestas can be antagonized by microinfusion of either nbqx
or ap-7 into the perirhinal cortex and nbqx only into the posterior
piriform cortex (halonen et al., 1994; tortorella et al., 1997). thus,
in the latter studies, nmda and ampa receptors turned out to be
the critical ones. this ﬁnding corresponds with the critical
receptors for the perirhinal cortex as shown in table 2, but not
for the posterior piriform cortex in which muscarinic and gabaa
receptors appear to be the critical ones (table 2). however, the
anticonvulsant effectiveness of pharmacological agents depends
on the mechanisms by which seizures are generated (gale, 1988;
löscher and ebert, 1996). corresponding seizure controlling target
areas have been identiﬁed in epilepsy and nerve agent research.
the mechanisms involved have similarities like the common
denominators of structures evolving epileptiform activity (fig. 1a)
and dissimilarities like the different nature of pharmacological
agents with anticonvulsant efﬁcacy. another example of such
dissimilarity represents the seizure controlling abilities of substantia nigra (pars reticulata) in which microinfusion of muscimol
has shown to attenuate generalized seizures induced by several
mechanisms (gale, 1988). in our laboratory, we have obtained
anticonvulsant effects of intranigral infusion of the gabaa
modulators diazepam, ethanol, or propofol, but not muscimol in
rats challenged with a convulsant dose of soman (myhrer et al.,
2006b). the substantia nigra from which seizures cannot be
generated can only be affected by gabaergic modulators (gale,
1988). the latter structure is a part of the basal ganglia and is
assumed to be involved in the spread of epileptiform activity
(löscher and ebert, 1996). for nerve agent research, the substantia
nigra does not emerge as a particularly pertinent structure to
examine, because it is not suited as a model for designing
prophylactic agents.
when soman is applied focally in the perirhinal cortex or
posterior piriform cortex, it has very potent seizurogenic effects
(table 1). the symptoms are similar to those generated by a
convulsant dose of soman given systemically (myhrer et al.,
2010a). these ﬁndings suggest that seizure activity per se can

t. myhrer / neurotoxicology 31 (2010) 629–638

evoke signs of intoxication. this mechanism is attributed to
hypothalamic autonomic dysfunction caused by seizures regardless of how they are generated, because corresponding reactions
are triggered by kindling or by use of other chemoconvulsants than
nerve agents (mraovitch and calando, 1999). conversely, seizures
induced systemically by soman can be prevented by microinfusion
of gabaa modulators into the area tempestas or substantia nigra.
this treatment results in a long period of incapacitation (nearly
2 h), but the rats behave normally thereafter and start eating 2–3 h
after soman exposure (myhrer et al., 2006b). the malfunctions
seen in both brain and body appear to be associated with the
epileptiform activity in itself and not the level of soman poisoning
in general. hence, it is pivotal to design efﬁcacious drugs that
either prevent onset of seizures or terminate ongoing seizures
rapidly in order to avoid or reduce the cascade of malfunctions
generated by epileptiform activity.
7. general discussion
7.1. receptors and drug designing for prophylactic use
anticonvulsant therapies designed to restrict seizure propagation in the common denominator structures (fig. 1a) may have
more widespread application and therapeutic potency than
therapies aimed at speciﬁc brain regions. however, drugs with
widespread efﬁcacy may exert more side effects than drugs that
target only one or a few critical areas. pretreatment against nerve
agent poisoning can ensure very efﬁcient protection, but it can
have its cost in terms of cognitive side effects in rats (myhrer,
2009). in addition to an anticonvulsant drug, prophylactic
treatment also includes the use of a reversible ache inhibitor,
such as pyridostigmine or physostigmin, in order to shield a
fraction of enzyme from the irreversible inhibition by nerve agent.
physostigmine that passes the blood–brain barrier has inhibitory
effect on ache in the numerous regions innervated by cholinergic
projections. thus, ache inhibitors are not well ﬁtted for speciﬁc
target areas of the brain.
table 3 shows that both anticholinergics and gabaa modulators infused into the area tempestas are highly effective in
preventing onset of seizures induced by soman. both atropine and
scopolamine antagonize all 5 muscarinic receptors. this effect may
explain their superior anticonvulsant potency relative to caramiphen and  xxxd3019xxx  with more restricted muscarinic impact
(myhrer et al., 2008a). in the latter study, it was suggested that
glutamatergic properties of caramiphen and  xxxd3019xxx  are not
the active ones, since no anticonvulsant efﬁcacy is obtained by mk801 or ketamine. for the same reason, the nmda antagonism of
ethanol and propofol (jouvert et al., 2002; kumari and ticku, 2000)
is probably without effect in area tempestas. muscimol acts at the
gabaa biding site and is classiﬁed as a direct agonist, whereas
other drugs effective at modulating sites of the gabaa receptors
are termed gabaa modulators (rang and dale, 1991). a number of
benzodiazepines have been tested against soman. systemic
administration of avizafone, clonazepam, diazepam, loprazolam,
and midazolam in pretreated rats (pyridostigmine, atropine)
shows that they all are effective in terminating soman-induced
seizures, but midazolam is the most potent one (mcdonough et al.,
1999). diazepam was used as specimen drug for the benzodiazepine group in the results presented in table 2. it cannot be ruled
out that in contrast to diazepam infusion of midazolam into the
area tempestas may produce anticonvulsant effect against soman
intoxication. ethanol with its diversity of effects is only considered
as a model drug with excellent anticonvulsant properties. propofol
that is used as an anesthetic drug in human medicine (jouvert et al.,
2002) may interfere with respiratory function. it has been
demonstrated in rats that propofol exerts a depressive effect on

635

neuronal output in the medullary respiratory center by mediating
agonism at gabaa receptors (kashiwagi et al., 2004). muscimol
that is isolated from the mushroom amanita muscaria, does not
affect respiratory frequency when injected intracerebroventricularly in rats, whereas gaba and baclofen affect respiration (hedner
et al., 1981).
metabotropic glutamate modulators infused into the perirhinal
cortex display anticonvulsant potency (table 3). in 25% of the
animals, full protection against seizure onset was achieved.
metabotropic glutamate agonists affecting group ii receptors
may be well suited for prophylactic application. the mgur2 and 3
function presynaptically as autoreceptors preventing excessive
release of glutamate. the anticonvulsant efﬁcacy of dcg-iv (table
3) is associated with activation of mglur2/3 receptors, and thereby
obtains efﬁcient decrease of excessive glutamate release without
affecting normal release (alexander and godwin, 2006). theoretically, mglur2/3 agonists should not impair cognition. in compliance with this notion, working memory is only modestly impaired
in rats given systemically the mglur2/3 agonist ly354740
compared to rats that received mk-801 (aultman and moghaddam, 2001). furthermore, ly354740 has been shown to reverse a
working memory deﬁcit induced by phencyclidine (moghaddam
and adams, 1998).
it has been demonstrated that systemic use of the  xxxg974xxx 
antagonist mpep can prevent onset of seizures evoked by
pilocarpine in up to 60% of the rats (jesse et al., 2008). the latter
results indicate that manipulation of glutamatergic pathways can
prevent or reduce onset of seizures generated by cholinergic
overstimulation. mpep (10 mg/kg) does not impede learning and
memory in the radial maze in rats (campbell et al., 2004). hence,
mpep may have potential as a prophylactic agent. collectively, the
ﬁndings presented suggest that modulators of metabotropic
glutamate receptors may open up a novel avenue for pretreatment
against nerve agent intoxication.
table 4 is based on the results presented in table 2 and
expresses the anticonvulsant impact factor (percentage of positive
effects) for drugs tested in at least 3 of the 4 seizure controlling
brain sites identiﬁed. as a prophylactic means scopolamine ranks,
not surprisingly, on top with an impact factor of 75. it might appear
somewhat surprisingly, however, that  xxxd3019xxx  achieves a
corresponding rank (75). this result is most likely dominated by
the m1–m4 antagonism of  xxxd3019xxx , because the impact factor
of the nmda antagonist ketamine is 0. however, when scopolamine or  xxxd3019xxx  is used systemically as prophylactics, they
need to be combined with an ache inhibitor (e.g. physostigmine)
to gain optimal anticonvulsant impact. when such combinations
are used, physostigmine and  xxxd3019xxx  exert more powerful
anticonvulsant potency than the combination of physostigmine
and scopolamine (philippens et al., 2006, 2007). the anticonvulsant impact of muscimol is moderate (50), while that for nbqx and
caramiphen is relatively low (33). when the percentage of
nonconvulsing rats from both lesion and microinfusion studies
(table 3) is used as guidance for selecting the most inﬂuential
seizure controlling brain sites, the area tempestas and perirhinal

cortex emerge as the most prominent ones. hence, the agents
ranked in table 4 play a central role again.  xxxd3019xxx  exerts
anticonvulsant efﬁcacy in both areas (high impact), whereas
scopolamine, nbqx, caramiphen, and muscimol yield anticonvulsant effects in 1 of the areas only (low impact).
pretreatment with pyridostigmine consists of a tablet (30 mg)
to be taken every 8 h in the armed forces in a number of nations.
during experimental work with animals, systemic administration
is usually applied, most frequently intraperitoneally or intramuscularly. midazolam is being considered by the us military to
replace diazepam as anticonvulsant for the treatment of nerve
agent-induced seizures (mcdonough et al., 2008). a comparison
of intramuscular, intranasal, or sublingual routes of midazolam
administration for the control of soman-triggered seizures in
guinea pigs has been carried out. the results showed that the
speed of seizure control for intramuscular or intranasal midazolam is the same, whereas sublingual midazolam acts
signiﬁcantly slower. intranasal midazolam administration would
act clinically as rapid as intramuscular administration (mcdonough et al., 2008). thus, alternative routes of administration for
prophylactic use exist.
if anticonvulsant drugs are intended to be given as pretreatment, they must be carefully examined for potential behavioral
side effects. it is pivotal that prophylactics used to protect military
personnel or ﬁrst responders against lethal doses of nerve agents
do not by themselves cause impairment of cognitive capability.
atropine and scopolamine are not well ﬁtted for use as
prophylactics, because these drugs cause pronounced cognitive
impairment in a number of behavioral tasks (myhrer, 2003).
however, the problem with anticholinergics may be solved if they
are administered along with an ache inhibitor that can counteract
the cholinergic antagonism produced by anticholinergics. behavioral effects of muscimol do not seem to have been broadly
examined. it has been reported that muscimol can attenuate rats’
performance in passive avoidance and spontaneous alternation
(myhrer, 2003). although, it would be expected that muscimol will
cause behavioral deﬁcits in a similar manner as found for diazepam
(cf., myhrer, 2003). it has been shown by using a sensitive novelty
test that behavioral side effects are very difﬁcult to avoid with
therapeutic doses of anticonvulsants. among the antiparkinson
drugs, benactyzine, caramiphen, and trihexyphenidyl reduce rats’
innate preference for novelty, while biperiden and  xxxd3019xxx  do
not. when benactyzine, caramiphen, or trihexyphenidyl is
combined with physostigmine the cognitive impairment disappears. this counteracting effect, however, causes changes in
locomotor and rearing activities not seen by each drug alone
(myhrer et al., 2008c). pretreatment with ache inhibitors
(physostigmine, galantamine, huperzine, donepezil) alone or in
combination with  xxxd3019xxx  severely depresses locomotor
activity and rearing in the novelty test (myhrer et al., 2010c).
7.2. receptors and drug designing for immediate and late treatment
according to the 3-phase model, anticholinergics will be
effective when administered within 5 min after seizure onset. if
the treatment is delayed beyond 5 min, drugs with antiglutamatergic effects along with drugs enhancing gabaa neurotransmission will become effective (mcdonough and shih, 1997). it is well
established that both atropine and scopolamine are very efﬁcacious in terminating nerve agent-induced seizures immediately
after onset. this efﬁcacy may be reﬂected in table 3 in which the
anticonvulsant potency of atropine or scopolamine is higher than
for caramiphen or  xxxd3019xxx . additionally, muscimol may also
be of high relevance in immediate treatment. the metabotropic
glutamate modulators presented in table 3 are expected to have
anticonvulsant effects during immediate treatment.

seizure activity lasting beyond 40 min is gradually more
difﬁcult to terminate (carpentier et al., 2001; lallement et al.,
1999). the refractory nature of sustained seizures represents a
great challenge in treatment of nerve agent poisoned victims long
time after exposure. sustained seizures are associated with both
brain damage and death (shih et al., 2003). seizure activity lasting
30 min or more (status epilepticus) has been shown to cause upregulation of nmda and ampa receptors along with internalization of gabaa receptors in hippocampal slices (chen and
wasterlain, 2006). this outcome means that gabaa receptors
are inactivated, because they are no longer within reach of the
neurotransmitter. furthermore, nmda and  xxxg981xxx  subunits move to the synaptic membrane where they form additional
excitatory receptors (chen and wasterlain, 2006). these conﬁgurations may explain why glutamatergic antagonists and gabaergic agonists become gradually ineffective during the development
of status epilepticus. given the markedly reduced responsiveness
of ionotropic receptors to conventional drug treatment alternative
treatment would be highly desirable.
one alternative would be to combine both nmda and ampa
antagonists in order to achieve optimal efﬁcacy at glutamatergic
receptors. treatment with the combination of nbqx and tcp 30 or
50 min after onset of soman-induced seizures has marked
anticonvulsant impact in rats pretreated with the oxime hi-6
and atropine (lallement et al., 1994b). the role of ampa receptors
in nerve agent-evoked seizures appears somewhat disputable
(mcdonough and shih, 1997). however, according to results
presented in table 2, the anticonvulsant efﬁcacy of the ampa
antagonist nbqx in the perirhinal cortex seems to be more
pronounced than that achieved by the nmda antagonist  xxxd3019xxx , because in the latter case the appearance of anticonvulsant
effect was dependent on concomitant muscarinic antagonism.
another alternative to conventional anticonvulsant treatment
would be modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors. it has
been suggested that metabotropic glutamate group ii-mediated
autoregulation of glutamate release can be targeted for the
development of anticonvulsant and antiepileptic drugs. in line with
this suggestion, dcg-iv has been shown to inhibit amygdalakindled seizures (alexander and godwin, 2006). however, evidence
indicates a long-lasting impairment of metabotropic glutamate
group ii receptors in epilepsy. in rats with  xxxd2950xxx mediated
seizures, a persistent down-regulation of mglur2 and mglur3 in
the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortical areas has been
demonstrated (garrido-sanabria et al., 2008). since the downregulation starts 24 h following onset of status epilepticus in the
latter study, it represents a problem for antiepileptic treatment, but
not for late treatment of nerve agent-generated seizures. hence,
metabotropic glutamate group ii receptors probably make up a
potential therapeutic target in nerve agent research.
 xxxd3019xxx  combined with either muscimol, ethanol, or
propofol can effectively terminate soman-induced seizures when
administered 30 min following onset, but without preventing some
neuropathology in the majority of the rats (myhrer et al., 2006a). the
anticonvulsant potency of the latter gabaa modulators had
previously been determined by microinfusions into the area
tempestas (myhrer et al., 2006b) indicating the transferability of
data from local application to systemic use after seizure onset.
repeated infusions of atropine into the medial septum after a
comparatively low level of soman (0.9  ld50) can stop seizure
activity (lallement et al., 1992). similarly, repeated infusions of
atropine into the area tempestas after start of seizures induced by
soman (1.3  ld50) have evident anticonvulsant impact, but the
seizure activity recurs 10–15 min following each injection (myhrer
and enger, unpublished data). conceivably, large parts of the
neuronal network must be affected systemically by anticonvulsants
to stop ongoing seizures. successful termination of seizures well

t. myhrer / neurotoxicology 31 (2010) 629–638

after their onset probably requires combination of drugs each with
optimal effects in some of the seizure controlling areas identiﬁed.
the high anticonvulsant potency of scopolamine (table 4) will
have limited use as a post-exposure antidote, because the
comparatively narrow cholinergic window of the 3-phase model
(about 5 min after seizure onset) makes the efﬁcacy of anticholinergics gradually weaker with elapse of time since seizure onset
(mcdonough and shih, 1997). on the other hand,  xxxd3019xxx 
(impact factor 75) has proved very useful as a post-exposure means
when combined with either muscimol, ethanol, or propofol as
referred above. however, these gabaergic modulators can depress
respiratory function, and about 17% of the rats died within 24 h with
each treatment regimen (myhrer et al., 2006a). to avoid adverse
effects on the brainstem, enhancement of  xxxd3019xxx ’s excellent
anticonvulsant impact on the seizure controlling sites of the
forebrain would make up a novel and interesting approach.
 xxxd2466xxx  with a unique proﬁle in preclinical models of epilepsy
has been shown to increase the potency of other antiepileptic drugs
up to 19-fold (kaminski et al., 2009). in recent experimentation, we
have observed that the combination of  xxxd2466xxx  and  xxxd3019xxx  can save the lives of rats that are about to die from a convulsant
dose of soman (myhrer and enger, unpublished results).
in epilepsy research, it has been a matter of debate whether
drugs with similar or dissimilar mechanisms of action may
produce the most powerful anticonvulsant impact. studies
supporting both scenarios exist, but overall, 2 drugs with similar
mechanism of action can provide greater therapeutic beneﬁt than
2 drugs acting on different mechanisms (kaminski et al., 2009).
this issue does not appear to have been examined systematically in
nerve agent research. according to the 3-phase model, pharmacological agents with different mechanisms of action will probably be
needed for optimal capacity against nerve agent poisoning. it has
been shown, however, that  xxxd3019xxx  combined with both
diazepam and pentobarbital (gabaa modulators) can effectively
terminate soman-induced seizures when administred 30–40 min
after onset, while the combinations of  xxxd3019xxx  and diazepam
or  xxxd3019xxx  and pentobarbital are inefﬁcient (myhrer et al.,
2003). these ﬁndings do not preclude that had the second
gabaergic drug in the above triple regimen been replaced by an
ampa antagonist or metabotropic glutamate modulator a similar
result might have been achieved.
8. concluding comments
the 3-phase model was developed to provide a theoretical
framework that may guide future work to determine the best drug
or treatment protocol to manage nerve agent-induced seizures
(mcdonough and shih, 1997). however, a vast number of drugs
with anticonvulsant potency will fulﬁl the relatively simple criteria
of this model. an alternative approach for future pharmacological
screening of anticonvulsants for nerve agent poisoning has been
based on identiﬁcation of seizure controlling regions and
speciﬁcation of receptors that should be affected to achieve
optimal anticonvulsant efﬁcacy. in this way, the list of potential
drug candidates can probably be radically shortened. there are
experimental approaches and techniques employed in epilepsy
research that with great beneﬁt can be used in nerve agent studies,
such as lesions and microinfusions. it may be difﬁcult to determine
the anticonvulsant efﬁcacy of a single agent in studies based on
systemic administration, whereas a more clear-cut anticonvulsant
differentiation can be obtained with the microinfusion technique.
moreover, particular anticonvulsant properties of gabaa modulators revealed by microinfusions into seizure controlling areas
have been shown to apply to systemic administration as well
(myhrer et al., 2006a,b). the detection of early activation of
glutamatergic receptors in the perirhinal cortex in response to

637

soman may open new possibilities for therapeutic strategies. in
this respect, it will be pertinent to examine the anticonvulsant
potential of metabotropic glutamate modulators. it will also be of
urgent interest to investigate the regions identiﬁed as seizure
controlling with in vitro techniques to achieve deeper insights into
mechanisms of relevance for the development of improved
therapies. the ultimate aim should be to develop anticonvulsants
ﬁtted in autoinjectors that can be administered by the military
personnel themselves regardless of the time of application.
