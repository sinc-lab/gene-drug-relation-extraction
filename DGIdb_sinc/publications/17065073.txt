 xxxg79xxx  is a well-known enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine to
amp: its metabolic and kinetic properties are well studied. here, we report new properties of rat liver
enzyme, demonstrating a new reaction: adp can be a phosphate donor instead atp, according to
the reaction: adenosine + adp → 2amp) demonstrating the efficiency of adk to phosphorylate
adenosine, also starting from adp. cells could exploited this property in situations in which atp
levels are strongly decreased and adp decreases slowly.

introduction
it is well known that adenosine (ado) is present both in cell cytosol,
plasma, and extracellular spaces and plays important roles in the life of
cells: changes in ado concentrations regulate a number of important physiological processes, such as rate of blood flow in the heart, skeletal muscle
and brain, rate of lipolysis in adipose tissue, and neurotransmission in the
brain.[1] many reports also have indicated general immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory properties,[2] underlying its role in regulation of the
immune system, stimulation of angiogenesis and inhibition of inflammatory
reactions at the site of injury.[3] such actions are carried out through
protein-coupled receptors: a1 ar, a2a ar, a2b ar, a3 ar.
adenosine is produced both in the cell and at the cell surface from
amp respectively by soluble 5’nucleotidase (e-ns) or membrane-bound
5’nucleotidase (ecto 5’-nt) (ec 3.1.3.5); its internal levels are controlled
by four enzymes: e-ns,  xxxd3157xxx  hydrolase ( xxxg104xxx ),
 xxxg62xxx  (ada,  xxxg62xxx ), which splits it to inosine and

 xxxg79xxx  (adk,  xxxg79xxx ) which transforms adenosine into amp,
regulating the amp-adp-atp pool, according to the following reaction
(reaction 1):

adenosine + atp → amp +adp
magnesium also is required in this reaction and is probably associated
with the substrate nucleotide.[4,5]
adk is abundant and ubiquitous in eukaryotes and is a key enzyme in the
regulation of both extra cellular adenosine and intracellular concentrations
of adenine nucleotides. in addition, it is responsible for the phosphorylation
and consequent clinical activity of several therapeutically useful nucleosides,
including the antiviral drug ribavirin and the immunosuppressive drug
mizoribine.[6,7] adk has been purified from a number of sources[7–11] and
extensively characterized at the kinetic level.[1] the enzyme is strongly
inhibited by adenosine concentrations above 5 µm; substrate specificity
has also been studied: deoxyadenosine, arabinoadenosine, and inosine are
phosphorylated, whereas other nucleosides such as guanosine, cytidine, and
uridine and their deoxy correspondents are not; atp,  xxxd1148xxx , gtp,  xxxd1837xxx ,
and utp are phosphorous donors and gtp,  xxxd1837xxx , and  xxxd1148xxx  were more
effective than atp in rats.
the enzyme has been cloned from both rat and human tissues and
expressed in e. coli.[12,13] two distinct forms of adk mrna were identified
with variations restricted to the extreme 5’-end, consistent with differential
splicing of a single transcriptional product.[13]
here we describe a new properties of rat liver adk: adp can be a
phosphate donor according to the reaction (reaction 2):
adenosine + adp → 2amp

materials and methods
we purified adk to homogeneity from rat liver according to slight
modifications of yamada et al. procedure.[7]
supernatant, derived from ultracentrifugation of fresh homogenized
rat liver, was submitted to a cationic exchange chromatography on a cmsepharose column; active fractions were pooled and solid (nh4 )2 so4 was
added to 45% saturation. after centrifugation, solid (nh4 )2 so4 was added
to the supernatant at 80% saturation. the solution was centrifuged, the
pellet dissolved in buffer, dialyzed and applied to an affinity chromatography column of amp-sepharose. the adk activity was eluted adding 5 mm
adenosine to the buffer and active fractions were applied to a gel-filtration
superdex column. the last step of the procedure consisted in an anionic
exchanged chromatography, on a de-52 cellulose column.

the final fraction shows only a single protein band by silver stained
sds-page[14] or analysed by nano esms (mw 38,345): because of the
high sensitivity of the methods used for the detection (less than 50 ng),
we can exclude any contamination with other related activities such as
ada, 5’nucleotidase (5’nt) which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of
amp to adenosine or adenylate kinase which generates atp starting from
2adp.
the pure enzyme was active when assayed for conventional adk reaction
(reaction 1) showing specific activity, vmax and km values for substrates in
the same order of magnitude than the literature.[15]
reaction 2 was assayed incubating the enzyme with  xxxd2531xxx  , 14 c adenosine,
and adp (we purified the substrates by hplc to avoid the presence of
contaminant triphosphates). the 14 c amp formed was separated on hplc
column and quantified on the base of the peak area and radioactivity
content (the specific activity of the product was compatible with the stoiochiometry of the reaction). the addition of 0.05 mm hena and 0.1 mm
amp-cp (potent inhibitors respectively of ada and 5’nt) to the mixture
was negligible. the stoichiometry of the reaction was verified: two moles of
amp were produced for mole of adp consumed.
the reaction was characterized for time course, linearity with protein
concentrations, effect of substrates and  xxxd2531xxx  concentrations and the corresponding km values.

results
kinetic properties of adk from several sources are reported in the
literature: rat liver or rat brain enzymes shows the same apparent km value,
that is 0.2 µm for adenosine and 0.02 mm for atp.[15] this value is much
higher in lupinus luteus [16] or in rat heart[17] (0.3 and 0.8 mm respectively).
no data are reported in literature about the possibility that adp can be
a phosphate donor.
figure 1 (a, b, c) reports the michaelis–menten plots for adenosine,
adp and  xxxd2531xxx  . we demonstrate that, using purified preparation of rat
liver adk, the affinity between the enzyme and adenosine does not vary so
much if adp substitutes atp in the reaction. in this condition the km value
for adenosine, evaluated at fixed adp concentration was calculated to be
0.83 µm; the km value for adp (1.92 mm) evaluated at fixed adenosine
concentration was higher than atp (about 95 times, but only 2.4 times
higher than in rat heart). the affinity versus  xxxd2531xxx  was also evaluated
incubating concentrations of  xxxd2531xxx  ranging from 0.5 to 8 mm at fixed
concentration of adenosine (2 µm) and adp (5 mm). the corresponding
km value was 2.1 mm.

reaction 2 was linear in the range of 0.1–0.5 µg protein and time and
adp could be substitutes by other nucleotides diphosphate. we demonstrated that udp, gdp, cdp, and dadp can be phosphate donors, more
or less efficiently than adp (table 1).

discussion
our results deserve attentive scrutiny and some considerations on the
reaction:

adp + adenosine → 2 amp
it is well known that the ratio of adenosine phosphorylation to adenosine deamination is important in determining the fate of adenosine and that
there is active cycling between adenosine and amp in many cells: adk plays
an important role in such regulation.[2]
from our results we may deduce that such regulation may be sometime
partially exerted by adp. such control could be important in all the
circumstances when atp is decreased at high extent because of the block
of its synthesis or its high requirement and at the same time the decrease
of adp is much less relevant. this may occur under several circumstances,
such as during particularly strong muscular work, fructose-induced hyperuricemia with atp depletion,[18] or severe nucleotide depletion as in
rheumatoid arthritis.[19] a striking example is represented by temporary
anoxia subsequent cardiac surgery, when it was demonstrated that during
aortic cross –clamping and successive clamp removal, atp and amp concentrations vary significantly, while adp levels remain in the range of basal
levels[20] and might be sufficient to contribute to eliminate adenosine by
phosphorylation.
in all this temporary atp-deficient situations, adk can, using residual
atp and through our reaction, continue to exploit its critical role in
regulation of cellular levels of adenosine.
