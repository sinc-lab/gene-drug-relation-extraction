drugs on cyclooxygenase activity in dogs

objective—to establish an in vitro assay and determine the differential suppressive activity of non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) on cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and cox-2 isoenzymes in dogs.
procedure—cox activity was evaluated in the presence and absence of 4 nsaid ( xxxd2561xxx , tolfenamic acid,  xxxd446xxx , and  xxxd2423xxx ), using a canine
monocyte/macrophage cell line that constitutively
expresses cox-1, but can be induced to express
cox-2 when incubated with lipopolysaccharide.
inhibition of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) synthesis by
each nsaid was measured by enzyme immunoassay
and attributed to specific cox-1 or cox-2 activity
through assessment of cox messenger rna expression by use of northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the
cox selectivity of each drug was evaluated from
dose-response curves by calculating a ratio (cox1:cox-2) of inhibitory concentration values on the
basis of concentrations that reduced pge2 by 50% in
each cox model.
results— xxxd2561xxx  and tolfenamic acid preferentially inhibited cox-2, with  xxxd2561xxx  inhibiting cox-2
activity 12 times more effectively than cox-1 activity.
 xxxd446xxx  was only 1.75 times more selective for
cox-2 than for cox-1, and  xxxd2423xxx  was slightly
more selective for cox-1.
conclusions—cox-1 and cox-2 were differentially sensitive to inhibition in vitro by nsaid.
 xxxd2561xxx  and tolfenamic acid were selective for
cox-2. effects of  xxxd446xxx  and  xxxd2423xxx 
approached equipotency against both isoenzymes.
selective cox-2 inhibitors are a new class of drugs
with anti-inflammatory effects similar to conventional nsaid but with fewer adverse effects.
development of these agents for veterinary use
would be facilitated by the convenience of using a
canine cell line as a model system to screen cox1 and cox-2 inhibitor activities in vitro. (am j vet

genase (cox)-2 inhibitors are a new class of non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) that may
provide safer and more potent analgesia than currently
available nonselective agents. however, little information is available on cox activity in dogs and cox inhibition by nsaid. development of cox-2 inhibitors for
veterinary use would be facilitated by assays to assess
their biochemical effectiveness in dogs.
pain accompanies inflammation following tissue
injury and is partly mediated by release of
prostaglandins (pg).  xxxd208xxx  (aa) is
released from cellular membrane phospholipid as a free
fatty acid by the enzyme  xxxg1759xxx , and is
channeled into 1 of 2 pathways: the lipoxygenase pathway or the prostaglandin h-synthase pathway (commonly referred to as the cox pathway).1,2
cyclooxygenase was first isolated and identified in
19763 and cloned in 1988.4 it is now accepted that this
original enzyme was actually cox-1, and another
unique isoform, known as cox-2, was reported in
1991.5 the 2 isoenzymes have different basal expression, tissue localization, and induction during inflammation.1,6,7
 xxxg1883xxx  is constitutively expressed in
most tissues and is thought to be responsible for most
basal pg production, which regulates normal cellular
activity.8,9 tissue enzyme concentration of cox-1 is
generally stable, with small increases in expression of
2- to 4-fold in response to stimulation by hormones or
growth factors.1,10  xxxg1884xxx  is not substantially expressed in most tissues under normal conditions
and is generally not detected in untreated cells in culture but is strongly induced following cellular exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (lps), and tumor necrosis factoralpha.8,11,12 once induced, cox-2 protein concentrations
increase rapidly and transiently 10- to 100-fold after
exposure to a single stimulus, releasing proinflammatory pg at the site of injury, resulting in erythema,
edema, and pain.11,13 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs presently available inhibit both isoenzymes to
various degrees; therefore, they reduce pg production
and consequent pain and inflammation at the affected
site through suppression of cox-2, but can also cause
gastric ulceration and renal compromise because of
inhibition of homeostatic pg in the stomach and kidneys.14-16
assessment of nsaid for their relative effects on
cox activity is complex. several in vitro models,
including purified enzyme systems, intact cell systems,
and whole blood systems have been developed to characterize the efficacy and toxicity of nsaid commonly
used in humans, through comparison of their relative
inhibitory activities against cox-1 and cox-2.17-19

drug concentrations at which enzyme activity is inhibited by 50% (inhibitory concentration [ic50]) are calculated and expressed as a ratio of cox-1 to cox-2.
preferential inhibition of cox-2 is indicated by a ratio
> 1, and a greater inhibitory effect on cox-1 versus
cox-2 is indicated by a ratio < 1. assessment of
inhibitory potency of nsaid on cox isoenzymes is
strongly influenced by variations in experimental conditions among different models; therefore, results from
each model cannot be directly compared. however, the
general ranking order of selectivity for cox-2 versus
cox-1 within a range of compounds appears to be
reproducible from one model to another.20,21 in addition, although cox activity may be similar in different
species, it is generally agreed that drug studies must be
performed on the particular species in question to evaluate efficacy and toxicity accurately.
it is well documented that human and rodent
monocyte/macrophage cells express cox-1 messenger
rna (mrna) and synthesize low concentrations of
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) in response to exogenous aa.
it has been reported that treatment with lps selectively and substantially increases cox-2 mrna expression, with no detectable effect on cox-1 mrna.
increased expression of cox-2 mrna is followed by
increased cox-2 protein expression and tissue pge2
concentrations.11,12,17,22 these studies suggest that
monocyte/macrophage cells may provide an ideal
source of each cox isoenzyme in vitro, because these
cells can express the constitutive isoform (cox-1) and
the inducible isoform (cox-2).
the purpose of the study reported here was to
establish an in vitro assay system, using a preexisiting
canine cell line that specifically expressed cox-1 and
cox-2 under distinct conditions to differentiate the
interaction of nsaid with these 2 isoforms in dogs.
cyclooxygenase expression and pge2 synthesis by the
canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cell line were
evaluated. northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) were
used to assess cox mrna expression, and enzyme
immunoassays were used to measure pge2 production.
the nsaid chosen for this study included anti-inflammatory agents presently available for use in dogs in
north america, which are reported to be clinically efficacious cox inhibitors and have favorable adverse
effect profiles.23,24
materials and methods
assessment of cox expression and pge2 synthesis by
canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells (cox-1 and
cox-2 models)—cyclooxygenase expression was determined in intact canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells.a
cells were maintained in monolayers in dmemb containing
15% fetal bovine serumc and penicillin (50 u/ml)-streptomycin (50 u/ml).b passaging of cells was performed regularly with trypsin.b
for each experiment, cells were seeded into 24 well
plates at 1 x 105 cells/well in dmem. after 24 hours, cells
were incubated overnight in serum-free dmem. canine
dh82 cells on 1 plate were incubated with lps (100 ng/ml)d
for a 6-hour period prior to any further treatment. cells were
preincubated for 30 minutes in serum-free dmem alone or in
serum-free dmem and 0.1% ethanole or  xxxd1896xxx 
ajvr, vol 61, no. 7, july 2000

(dmso).f the medium was removed and replaced with fresh
serum-free dmem alone or with serum-free dmem with
0.1% ethanol or dmso. arachidonic acidd was added to half
of the treatment wells to a final concentration of 30 µm, and
cells were further incubated for 30 minutes. all incubations
were performed at 37 c and 5% co2. following the second
incubation, medium was removed from each well, centrifuged, and stored at –70 c for pge2 analysis, and total cellular rna was collected for northern blot analysis. the
effects of ethanol and dmso on pge2 synthesis were determined to ensure that the use of either compound as a vehicle
to dissolve nsaid for future cox inhibition studies would
not alter the results.

monocyte/macrophage cells were seeded into 24 well plates,
as described, and incubated overnight in serum-free dmem.
cells were incubated with lps for 6 hours prior to any further treatment for the cox-2 assay. incubation was not
required for the cox-1 assay. cells were preincubated with
each compound in serum-free dmem for 30 minutes.
medium was removed, and a second 30 minute incubation
identical to preincubation but including the addition of aa
to each well for a final concentration of 30 mm was performed. negative control wells contained only serum-free
dmem and 0.1% vehicle. positive control wells contained
serum-free dmem, 0.1% vehicle, and aa. all incubations
were performed at 37 c and 5% co2. following the second
incubation, medium was removed from each well, centrifuged, and stored at –70 c for pge2 analysis, and total cellular rna was collected for northern blot analysis.
drugs—for nsaid enzyme inhibition studies,  xxxd2561xxx ,g tolfenamic acid,d  xxxd446xxx ,d and ketoprofend were
used. stock solutions of each drug were prepared in ethanol
or dmso and serially diluted in serum-free dmem for addition to cultures. concentrations of ethanol or dmso in wells
did not exceed 0.1%. for each experiment, compounds were
evaluated at identical concentrations on the same assay plate.
each drug was evaluated at 0.003125, 0.0125, 0.05, 0.2, 0.8,
3.2, 12.8, and 51.2 µg/ml, a range of concentrations that
encompasses mean maximum plasma concentrations of each
drug following in vivo administration in healthy dogs.25-28
eicosanoid

(eia)—
 xxxd1903xxx  was assessed by eia according to manufacturer’s protocol.h the detection limit for pge2 was 7.8 pg/ml.
specificity of the eia was 100%, and cross-reactivity with
other eicosanoids was < 1%.
northern blot analysis—the 1.8 kilobase (kb) fragments of cox-1 and cox-2 complementary dna (cdna)i
were subcloned into the noti, hindiii, and ecor1, apai vector sites,j respectively.12 fidelity of cdna fragments was verified by dye terminator cycle sequencing, using a dna
sequencer.k
total cellular rna was isolated, using 1 ml of reagentl
per 5 x 105 cells as described by the manufacturer. contents
of each set of treatment wells were pooled for maximum rna
recovery. total rna (20 µg) was subjected to electrophoresis
in 0.8 % agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes,m and
prehybridized for 1 hour in 0.5%  xxxd3215xxx 
(sds), 5x denhardt solution, 6x  xxxd3213xxx /sodium

sperm dna (10 mg/ml).n the human cox-1 and cox-2
probes were radiolabelled with [alpha-32p]dctpm and a random
primer labelling kitm as per manufacturers’ instructions. the
32
p-labelled cdna were incubated for 16 hours, with membranes in a solution identical to the solution used for prehybridization. membranes were then washed twice (15 minutes
each) at 42 c in 2x  xxxd3213xxx /sodium citrate buffer

for 15 minutes for cox-2 and 55 c for 30 minutes for
cox-1. each membrane was probed for cox-1, stripped
with 0.1% sds, and rehybridized with the probe for cox-2
at separate times. membranes were also rehybridized with a
probe for murine 7s rnao that served as a load control.
phosphoimaging with commercially available softwarep was
used to image the radioactive blots.q
reverse transcription and pcr—ribonucleic acid
(1 µg), which was obtained from canine platelets and canine
dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells as described, was reversetranscribed with reverse transcriptaseb in the presence of 10

primer,s dnase i,b 10x dnase i buffer,b 2 µl mdtt (0.1 m),b
and 3′ (antisense) primer (50 pmol/µl), in dimethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. resultant cdna was diluted 5 times. in
a thin-walled pcr tube, 10 µl of cdna was amplified in a
final volume of 100 µl containing 2 µl dntp (10 mm), 5.0 µl
mgcl2 (50 mm),b 0.2 µl taq dna polymerase,b 10 µl 10x
pcr buffer,b 2 µl (50 pmol/µl) each of sense and antisense

acaggtcttggtgttgagg.t amplification conditions
were 94 c for 3 minutes for 1 cycle, 94 c for 30 seconds
(denaturation), 55.5 c for 30 seconds, and 72 c for 1 minute
(primer annealing and extension) for 40 cycles, and 72 c for
5 minutes. polymerase chain reaction products were identified following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel that contained ethidium bromide (10 mg/µl)n in tris-acetate buffer.
the remaining 90 µl of sample was purified by use of a pcr
purification kit,u and the identity of the cox-1 product confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing by use of a dna
sequencer.k
data analyses— xxxd1903xxx  synthesis by canine
dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells was expressed as mean ±
sd. differences between vehicle (ethanol or dmso) control
and treatment groups were determined by use of a student
t-test.
eight concentrations were evaluated for each nsaid in
2 experiments. results of 9 treatment wells, each containing
a specific drug dissolved in a vehicle and aa from each
experiment were calculated as mean (± sem) percentage
pge2 synthesis and compared with positive control wells
containing vehicle and aa only. data analyses were performed by use of a statistical software package.v statistical
interpretation was performed by use of anova. a quadratic
regression was applied to describe the relationship of each
drug and cox model to drug concentration. comparisons
among data sets were performed by contrast by use of an f
test. values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

cyclooxygenase expression and pge2 synthesis
by canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells (cox-1
and cox-2 models)—using northern blot analysis,
cox-2 expression was not detected in canine dh82
monocyte/macrophage cells prior to lps exposure
(fig 1). however, following a 6-hour incubation period with lps, the 4.5 kb cox-2 mrna transcript was
strongly expressed.  xxxg1883xxx  was not
detectable in dh82 cells by northern blot analysis
under any conditions but was detected by rt-pcr
analysis of rna obtained from canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells by use of primers designed on
the basis of the human cox-1 gene sequence (fig 2).

brane as dh82 cells that were and were not treated
with lps expressed the 2.8 kb cox-1 transcript, but
cox-2 message was not detected (fig 1). platelets are
the only cells that consistently demonstrate exclusive
cox-1 expression in all species previously studied and
thus provided an ideal control to test the homology of
the cox probes to canine mrna; therefore, these findings confirmed the ability of the human cox cdna
probes to detect canine cox-1 message, without crossreacting with cox-2 under the conditions used in this
study.1,6
results achieved through northern blot analysis
and rt-pcr indicated that canine dh82 monocytes/macrophage cells contain 1 constitutively
expressed isoform (cox-1) and consequently synthesized low amounts of pge2, and 1 inducible isoform
(cox-2) with correspondingly increased amounts of
pge2 synthesis. therefore, unstimulated dh82 cells
were used as a cox-1 model, and lps-treated dh82
cells were used as a cox-2 model to screen nsaid
that are used in dogs for their in vitro activity against
each cox enzyme.
enzyme inhibition studies—in the cox-1 model,
following nsaid incubation with non-lps treated
canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells, cox-1 was
detected by rt-pcr, and cox-2 was not detected by
northern blot analysis of total rna. however, in the
cox-2 model following nsaid incubation with dh82
cells that had been exposed to lps for 6 hours, the 4.5
kb cox-2 mrna transcript was strongly expressed.
 xxxg1883xxx  was not detected in dh82 cells by
northern blot analysis under any conditions (fig 3).
results obtained by northern blot analysis and rtpcr suggested that nsaid suppression of pge2 synthesis in non-lps treated dh82 cells was caused by
inhibition of cox-1, and suppression of pge2 synthesis in lps-treated cells was primarily caused by inhibition of cox-2.
all drugs significantly inhibited pge2 production
by dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells in the cox-1
(non-lps treated cells) and cox-2 models (lps-treated cells) in a dose-dependent manner (fig 4); however, tolfenamic acid did not inhibit pge2 in vitro at concentrations of 0.003125 mg/ml or 0.0125 mg/ml in the
cox-2 model.
in the cox-1 model, significant differences in
inhibition of pge2 synthesis were not detected

suppressive than either  xxxd2561xxx  or tolfenamic acid,
significantly inhibiting pge2 synthesis more than tolfenamic acid at every drug concentration, and more than
 xxxd2561xxx  at all but the lowest concentration evaluated (0.003125 µg/ml). significant differences were not
detected between tolfenamic acid and  xxxd2561xxx  in
the cox-1 assay, except at 0.003125 mg/ml and
0.0125 µg/ml.
in the cox-2 model, all drugs had similar potency against cox-2. significant differences were not
detected between the inhibitory effects of  xxxd446xxx 
and  xxxd2561xxx , or  xxxd446xxx  and tolfenamic acid
(except at 0.003125 µg/ml and 0.0125 µg/ml), or of

synthesis in the cox-2 model significantly more than
in the cox-1 model at all but the lowest (0.003125

tolfenamic acid inhibited pge2 synthesis significantly

the cox selectivity of each drug was evaluated by
calculating the ic50 values, which were based on the
drug concentration that reduced pge2 synthesis by
50% in each cox model. the relative activity against
each isoenzyme was expressed as a ratio of cox-1 to
cox-2 activity (table 1). a cox activity ratio is not
shown for tolfenamic acid, because 50% pge2 suppression by this nsaid was not achieved in the cox1 model; therefore, an ic50 for cox-1 could not be calculated.  xxxd2561xxx  was 12.27 times more selective for
canine cox-2 than cox-1.  xxxd446xxx  was only 1.75

discussion
our ability to detect only cox-1 in untreated
canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage cells, and demonstrate expression of the 4.5 kb cox-2 transcript in
lps-treated dh82 cells following northern blot analysis and rt-pcr is consistent with previous reports in
the literature that confirm substantial increases in
cox-2 mrna expression following exposure to lps,
with no detectable effect on cox-1 mrna.7,11,12,17 the
ability of human cox cdna probes to detect cox-2
but not cox-1 message in these cells may be explained
by the possibility that under continuous culture conditions, cox-1 message is expressed at such a low constitutive concentration that it is below the level of
detection of northern blot analysis.
although cox-2 expression was not detected in
non-lps stimulated canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage
cells, it is possible that, as for cox-1, mrna concentrations were too low to be detected by northern blot
analysis. we attempted to evaluate possible cox-2
presence in non-lps stimulated cells by use of rt-pcr,
but were unable to amplify cox-2 from reverse-transcribed mrna obtained from either unstimulated or
lps-stimulated canine dh82 cells. it is possible that
the experimental conditions under which pcr was
performed require further refinement to detect cox-2
activity in canine cells. however, as an immediate early
response gene, cox-2 is rapidly induced, and profoundly expressed in response to lps; once upregulated, cox-2 mrna should be easily detectable by northern blot analysis. our findings of low amounts of pge2
synthesis by non-lps treated dh82 cells corresponds
to the expected low constitutive amounts of cox-1
expression, and the 4-fold increase in pge2 synthesis
following a 6-hour incubation period with lps corresponds with strongly induced cox-2 expression. if
cox-2 is present in non-lps treated dh82 cells, its
expression is expected to be minimal and would not
substantially contribute to pge2 synthesis.
previous studies of monocyte/macrophage cells in
other species have also revealed a lack of cox-2
expression, and constitutive cox-1 expression in
untreated monocyte/macrophage cells.  xxxg1884xxx  mrna was not detected by rt-pcr or northern blot analysis until cells were exposed to mitogenic
or inflammatory stimuli, and the expression profile
was similar to what we found in our study.11,12,22
from our findings, it was suggested that low concentrations of pge2 synthesized by non-lps treated
canine dh82 cells were primarily the result of cox-1
enzyme activity, and increased pge2 synthesis by lpstreated dh82 cells was predominantly in response to
induced cox-2 enzyme activity. thus, we were able to
demonstrate the suitability of using canine dh82
monocytes/macrophage cells under different conditions as cox-1 and cox-2 models to screen nsaid in
vitro.
a recent study reported nsaid cox inhibition
profiles for dogs that were consistent with the results
ajvr, vol 61, no. 7, july 2000

we observed.30 canine platelets were used as a source of
cox-1 in the previous study, and lps-treated dh82
monocyte/macrophage cells were used as a source of
cox-2. results of general cox specificity in canine
cells that had been reported were similar to results
from our study.  xxxd2423xxx  was found to be marginally preferential for cox-1, and  xxxd446xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx ,
and tolfenamic acid were found to be preferential for
cox-2; however, the overall ranking order of cox-2
selectivity differed from the findings of our study.
there are several model-specific differences that make
comparison among assay systems difficult; however,
time-dependent cox inhibition by nsaid may provide a partial explanation for the differences in cox-2
rankings between the 2 studies. in our study, equal
incubation time was allotted to each nsaid for each
cox model, whereas different nsaid incubation
times between the cox-1 and cox-2 models were
used in the other study, thereby potentially affecting
rate of cox inhibition and calculated ic50 ratios.
the ratio of the ic50 of cox-1 and the ic50 of
cox-2 is a variable widely used throughout the literature as the gold standard of cox selectivity of various
nsaid.20,21 in our study, significant differences in the
individual effects of  xxxd446xxx  and  xxxd2423xxx  on inhibition of pge2 synthesis between cox models were
not detected; therefore, it would be expected that these
2 nsaid have relatively equal activity against both
cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes. the calculated ic50 ratios
from our experiments reflect this, because a ratio of 1
designates equipotency against both enzymes; detected
ratios of 1.75 for  xxxd446xxx  and 0.36 for  xxxd2423xxx  do
not deviate far from this standard.
for  xxxd446xxx , this lack of specificity against either
enzyme has been observed in other studies, and, in
fact, it has been reported that  xxxd446xxx  is a relatively
weak cox inhibitor, and as yet, its true mode of action
is unclear.16,31  xxxd446xxx ’s equipotent activity (ic50
ratio of 1) against cox-1 and cox-2 was also
observed in another in vitro study, in which cultured
bovine aortic endothelial cells were used as a source of
cox-1 enzyme, and j774.2 macrophages stimulated
with lps were used as a source of cox-2 enzyme.20
ex vivo studies using models of inflammation have
been unable to demonstrate significant cox inhibition
by  xxxd446xxx  at clinical doses in the dog.25  xxxd446xxx ’s
equipotent inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes
in vitro may also occur in vivo, but because  xxxd446xxx 
does not appear to inhibit canine cox at therapeutic
doses, it is not possible to evaluate this effect at this
time.16,25,31  xxxd446xxx  is an effective analgesic, but it has
been suggested that analgesic effects of  xxxd446xxx  may
develop by an alternative mechanism than systemic
cox inhibition, and, in some species, higher than
approved doses may be required to induce anti-inflammatory effects, compared with the dose needed to
relieve pain.31-34
it has also been reported that  xxxd2423xxx  is a
potent analgesic for dogs and cats.35,36  xxxd2423xxx  is
typically preferential for cox-1 in vitro (as reported
here); this has also been demonstrated by other studies
in which the effects of nsaid on whole blood or cultured cells have been examined.19,30,37 in a model of

inflammation in horses,  xxxd2423xxx  inhibited both
serum thromboxane b2 (txb2) synthesis (cox-1) and
pge2 synthesis in exudate (cox-2) for up to 24
hours.38 the ability of  xxxd2423xxx  to inhibit cox-1 and
cox-2 in vivo reinforces the validity of our data collected in vitro.
 xxxd2561xxx  has been reported to be an effective
anti-inflammatory and analgesic in dogs and cats.39-41
our finding of the significantly greater effect of  xxxd2561xxx  on pge2 inhibition in the cox-2 model versus
the cox-1 model was also reflected by the calculated
ic50 value of 12.27, a much higher ratio than values
calculated for  xxxd446xxx  or  xxxd2423xxx . in concurrence
with our findings,  xxxd2561xxx  has been consistently
shown to be cox-2 preferential in vitro and is also
capable of sustained cox-2 inhibition in vivo.42-45 in an
equine tissue cage model,  xxxd2561xxx  initially inhibited txb2 formation in serum (cox-1) and exudate
(cox-2).45 however, there was no inhibition of serum
txb2 after 8 hours, but concentrations in exudate
remained suppressed. this indicates that inhibition of
cox-1 is reversible, and cox-2 suppression is prolonged at sites of inflammation following administration of  xxxd2561xxx .45
like  xxxd2561xxx , tolfenamic acid preferentially
inhibited cox-2 in our study. there are conflicting
reports of the cox specificity of tolfenamic acid; one
study recorded a cox-2 preferential ic50 value of
15.0,30 which is in agreement with our findings, but
another recorded a cox-1 preferential ic50 value of
0.06.20
tolfenamic acid has been shown to almost completely inhibit ex vivo synthesis of txb2 (cox-1) in
serum, and to suppress pge2 formation (cox-2) in
exudate from tissue cages in dogs and calves.26,46,47 in
dogs, the duration of txb2 inhibition in serum was
short lived, because 50% inhibition was not detected
beyond 8 hours at clinical dosage regimens. these
studies demonstrate the cox-2 suppressive effect of
tolfenamic acid and support our findings of the cox2 preference of this nsaid.
tolfenamic acid did not achieve 50% inhibition of
pge2 in our cox-1 model; therefore, calculation of an
ic50 ratio for this drug was not possible.20,30 however,
cox-1 inhibition exceeding 50% has been detected in
vivo, diminishing over time. a possible explanation is
that reversible inhibition of cox-1 develops slowly in
vivo secondary to the relatively slow distribution of
tolfenamic acid from plasma to the inflammatory site,
compared with other nsaid and that reversal of cox1 suppression develops more rapidly at the high free
drug concentrations of tolfenamic acid present in the
in vitro system.25,26,46 regardless, it appears that the in
vitro model system does not entirely reflect the in vivo
effects of tolfenamic acid in dogs and requires further
investigation.
if the cox selectivity of each nsaid evaluated in
our canine cell assay were extrapolated to an in vivo
situation, it would be expected that administration of
preferential cox-2 inhibitors (eg,  xxxd2561xxx  and
tolfenamic acid) to dogs would provide effective relief
of pain and inflammation and cause fewer and less
severe adverse effects than the nonselective inhibitor
808

 xxxd2423xxx . these conclusions appear to be supported
by clinical studies that have examined adverse affects
associated with use of nsaid in dogs. results appeared
to reflect the anticipated physiologic effects associated
with cox-1 or cox-2 preference, as reflected by the
system we used. forsyth et al48 reported that 5 of 6
dogs treated with  xxxd2423xxx  at the recommended
dosage had endoscopic evidence of hemorrhage or gastric erosions, although the dogs appeared clinically
normal. in a more recent study by the same author in
which gastric ulceration was evaluated in dogs after
administration of nsaid, fewer dogs developed gastric
lesions after administration of  xxxd446xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx , compared with  xxxd2423xxx , although the difference was not significant.49 these adverse findings may
be consistent with the nonselective and even slightly
preferential cox-1 inhibition by  xxxd2423xxx  at clinical
dosage regimens, and provide supportive evidence of a
more desirable safety profile expected by preferential
cox-2 inhibitors such as  xxxd2561xxx , as predicted by
the in vitro screening technique we used. on the basis
of the nonspecific in vitro cox inhibition observed in
these 2 agents, it would be expected that the effects of
 xxxd446xxx  on the gastrointestinal tract would be similar
to those for  xxxd2423xxx . however, the lack of detectable
cox-1 or cox-2 inhibition in vivo following therapeutic doses of  xxxd446xxx  in dogs may explain why its
safety profile is similar to that of a cox-2 inhibitor
such as  xxxd2561xxx .16,25,31
several issues should be addressed when evaluating the predictive value of any model. it is desirable to
use whole cell systems containing the intact cox
enzyme of the species under investigation. protein
binding, time-dependent inhibition, and source of aa
are factors that should all be considered.21,50 in designing our in vitro cell assay system, characteristics of the
ideal model were implemented as closely as possible.
effect of protein binding is difficult to mimic in vitro;
therefore, a protein-free (serum-free) system was used
in our study and all drugs were acting in a free and
unbound form. results from nsaid inhibition assays
that allow for time-dependent inhibition by preincubating cells with the drugs being tested correlate more
closely with clinical data.50 inhibitor time-dependency
was also addressed in our study by preincubating each
drug with dh82 cells for 30 minutes prior to the 30minute incubation period with drug and a single concentration of exogenous aa, which is a technique used
in other studies.17,44 the resulting predictive value of
the model system correlates well with data from other
in vitro studies and is supported by findings of clinical
studies that examined efficacy and toxicity of the
nsaid evaluated in our study.30,42,43,48,49
most in vitro or ex vivo studies measure txb2 or
pge2 concentrations in serum or culture medium
from untreated cells as indices of cox-1 activity;
however, txb2 and pge2 are also measured in inflammatory exudate or culture medium from stimulated
cells as indices of cox-2 activity.25,30,32,45 evaluation of
cox inhibition by nsaid based solely on measurement of txb2 or pge2 concentrations may not accurately reflect specific cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition,
because these pg can be a product of either cox

isoenzyme. our ability to measure pge2 synthesis and
attribute it to canine cox-1 or cox-2 gene expression through northern blot analysis or rt-pcr is
novel and may provide a more complete evaluation of
cox inhibition than measurement of pg synthesis
alone.
the ability of nsaid to preferentially inhibit
cox-2 over cox-1 in vivo is dependent on various
factors that cannot be achieved with an in vitro model,
including individual pharmacokinetic differences, protein binding, and tissue distribution. therefore, true
predictability of in vivo drug efficacy and toxicity is not
possible from an in vitro assay.21 however, comparison
of differential inhibition of cox enzyme by each drug
relative to others evaluated in the same model system
may be possible.
it would be advantageous to establish an in vitro
assay for canine cox inhibition by nsaid to permit
rapid screening of potential cox-2 selective inhibitors
in the early stages of clinical development. such an
assay would minimize experimental animal usage and
decrease the time required for new drug approval,
because only nsaid that significantly inhibit cox-2
would be further evaluated in vivo. preferential cox-2
inhibitors would provide veterinarians with greater
options for analgesia in animals following trauma or
surgery and for control of chronic inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis.
in this study, we have described a simple and convenient assay system to screen cox-1 and cox-2
inhibitor activities in intact canine cells in vitro. this
assay offers the advantage of assessing canine cox
inhibition within a similar test protocol and circumvents the need for purification of either platelets or
peripheral blood monocytes. we have used a convenient source of cox-1 found in an untreated permanent culture of canine dh82 monocyte/macrophage
cells and induced cox-2 in the same cell type through
incubation with lps.
