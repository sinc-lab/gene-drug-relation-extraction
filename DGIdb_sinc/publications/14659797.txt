abstract
objective: appetite-suppressant drug fenfluramine is implicated in primary pulmonary hypertension (pph) but the molecular pathways
that mediate this effect are unknown. a mouse model incriminates the serotonin  xxxg1114xxx  but contrasts with other models where this
receptor has been shown to mediate pulmonary arterial relaxation via  xxxd2738xxx  production. methods: we analyzed the human 5-ht2b
gene in 10 patients with appetite-suppressant drug-associated pph. results: a mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product
was found in one patient. the mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5-ht2b mutation was found in 18 pph patients not
associated with appetite-suppressants. functional analysis of the transfected receptor expressed either transiently in cos cells or stably in
cho cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the second messenger inositol-phosphates cascade and subsequent
intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell membrane. the mutated receptor had no constitutive activity, and
produced no dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor. conclusion: loss of serotonin  xxxg1114xxx  function may predispose to
fenfluramine-associated pph in man.

1. introduction
primary pulmonary hypertension (pph; primary ph) is a
syndrome of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope
resulting from a pre-capillary increase in pulmonary vascular
resistance leading to sustained elevation of pulmonary arte* corresponding author. service de génétique médicale, hôpital

rial pressure, right ventricular failure, and death. from a
clinical standpoint, a diagnosis of pph is made after exclusion of known causes of secondary ph [1]. the overall
incidence of pph is 1– 2 cases per million people per year,
and increases up to 1 in 10,000 after intake of appetitesuppressant drugs, mainly fenfluramines and aminorex [2,3].
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) receptor type ii
(bmpr2 gene) [4,5] result in pph transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with low penetrance, around 10– 20%.
such hereditary mutations are found in 25– 30% of apparently sporadic cases [6]. the molecular causes for the
majority of pph cases, and the causes for reduced penetrance
in bmpr2 mutation carriers, are unknown, but some other
genetic predisposition is likely.
fenfluramine and its stereoisomer dexfenfluramine (collectively referred to as fenfluramines) are indirect serotonin

(5-ht) agonists which act by releasing 5-ht from storage
vesicles. fenfluramines are furthermore rapidly de-ethylated
in vivo to form norfenfluramines, which bind 5-ht2b and 5ht2c receptors with high affinity and display direct agonist
activity [7]. 5-ht2b is expressed in endothelial and smooth
muscle cells of porcine and human pulmonary arteries [8,9],
and is strongly overexpressed in lungs of pph patients [10].
the  xxxg1114xxx  is a 7-transmembrane domain, gprotein-coupled receptor, which contains a pdz binding
motif that can directly activate the constitutive endothelial
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) [11]. 5-ht2b coupling to gq
furthermore activates the inositol-phosphates (ip) second
messenger cascade and calcium release [8].
in the pig pulmonary artery, 5-ht2b agonists produce a
reversible, endothelium-dependent relaxation [9]. in contrast with this vasodilative effect, however, 5-ht2b has
recently been implicated in vascular proliferation and ph
in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and norfenfluramine, a
model that shares features with pph [10]. to sort out the
net effect of 5-ht2b function in man, we investigated the
human  xxxg1114xxx  gene in 10 patients with fenfluramine-related pph, and found a loss-of-function mutation
in one.

acataactaacttgctcttc, reverse primer tcgatctaga t t t c at c at c a g c c a a at g c at c c c gaaatgt for mutant 5-ht2b. following sequencing of
the constructs, the mutated reading frames were subcloned
into the bicistronic expression vector pefin3 as previously
described [13] for generation of stable cell lines. all constructs were verified by sequencing before transfection.
constructs encoding fusion proteins of enhanced gfp
(egfp, packard, emerald) linked to the carboxy-terminus
of wt or mutant 5-ht2b were generated by pcr. 5-ht2b was
amplified with a forward primer described above and a
reverse primer replacing the tga stop codon by a xhoi
restriction site (5v-tcgactcgag tacataactaacttgctcttc-3v for wild-type  xxxg1114xxx  and 5v- tcgactcgaggccaaatgcatcccgaaatgt-3v for mutated
5-ht2b). egfp was amplified by a forward primer containing a xhoi restriction site, followed by a flexible triglycine
linker replacing the atg start codon (5v-tcgactcgag
gggggaggtgtgagcaagggcgaggag-3v) and a reverse primer containing a xba1 restriction site after the stop
codon (5v-tcgatctaga ttacttgtacagctcgtcc3v). egfp was then cloned in frame with the 5-ht2b cterminus using the xhoi restriction site, and the linker
sequence leggg between the two coding regions. after
checking the constructs by sequencing, the fusion proteins
coding sequences were transferred into the bicistronic vector
pefin3, using the bamh1 and xba1 restriction sites.

2.1. study patients
2.3. expression of mutant receptors in cho-k1 cell lines
we studied 10 patients who developed pulmonary arterial
hypertension and reported intake of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, alone or in combination with diethylpropion
(amfepramone) or phentermine. a diagnosis of pph was
reached after careful exclusion of known causes of pah
according to current guidelines [1]. the 10 patients, nine
females and one male of western european descent, took
appetite suppressants at recommended anorexic dose. family
history regarding pph was unremarkable over three generations. the investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki.
2.2. mutagenesis and 5-ht2b constructs
the different constructs of the human wild-type 5-ht2b
and the natural carboxy-terminal domain mutant r393x
were performed by pcr as described [12] using the following primers: forward primer containing bamh1 restriction
site (underlined) used for untagged and green fluorescent
protein (gfp) fusion receptors: 5v-tcgaggatccaccatggctctctcttacagagtg; forward primer containing bamh1 restriction site used for the fusion protein

cho-k1 cells were cultured using ham’s f12 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (life technologies,
merelbeke, belgium), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ag/ml
streptomycin (life technologies). cells were serum-starved
24 h before all functional assays. a plasmid encoding
apoaequorin under control of the sra promoter [14] was
transfected into cho-k1 cells, using fugene 6 (roche).
 xxxd3041xxx  (100 ag/ml, calbiochem) selection of transfectants was initiated 2 days after transfection. individual clones
were isolated 3 weeks later, and the clone with strongest
functional response (luminescence signal) to  xxxd2379xxx  a
(100 nm) and atp (10 am) was selected. constructs
encoding wild-type or mutant 5-ht2b in the pefin3 bicistronic vector were further transfected using fugene 6 in this
apoaequorin expressing cell line. selection of transfected
cells was made for 14 days with 400 ag/ml  xxxg418xxx  (life
technologies), and the population of mixed cell clones
expressing wild-type or mutant receptors was used for
binding and functional studies.
2.4. ip assay
cos cells were seeded 2 days before the experiment
(6  104/well in a 24-well plate). after overnight growing in
the recommended culture medium, cells were transfected
with various concentrations of plasmids using lipofectamine

2000 (invitrogene). four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to dmem (biowhittaker, cat no. 12604f)
containing 3 aci/ml [3h] myo-inositol (amersham). on the
next day, medium containing [3h] myo-inositol was removed
and cells were washed twice with css buffer (tris 25 mm,
ph 7.4; nacl 120 mm; kcl 5.4 mm; cacl2 1.8 mm; mgcl2
0.8 mm; d-glucose 16.4 mm). cells were analyzed for
receptor expression by facs analysis or were incubated
for 30 min at 37 jc with various concentrations of agonist in
the css buffer containing 10 mm of licl. reactions were
stopped by addition of hclo4 1 n to each well and incubated
for 30 min at 4 jc. koh phosphate buffer was then added to
each well and incubated at 4 jc for 1 h to form kclo4
precipitate. a sample buffer containing 30 mm dinatetraborate and 3 mm edta was then added on each well and the
plate was centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 jc for 5 min.
at the same time, mini anion exchange columns were
prepared as follows. dowex resin ag1x8 formate form
(biorad, cat no. 140 –1454) was weighed and mixed with
distilled water (25% w/v). about 1.6 ml of this resin was
added to each poly prep column (biorad, cat no. 731 –
1550). the columns were then washed one time with 5 ml
of distilled water. the supernatant of each well was applied
to the columns containing anion exchange resin and the

columns were rinsed with 5 ml of distilled water. the gpi
was eluted with 10 ml of 5 mm dinatetraborate/60 mm
ammonium formate. the ips mixture were then eluted with
0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx /1 m ammonium formate and collected
into scintillation vials. radioactivity was determined by
adding 3.5 ml of scintillation cocktail and counted in
tricarb. results were expressed as the ratio between the
radioactivity collected in the ip fraction over the radioactivity recovered from the solubilised cellular membranes.
the use of this ratio allows for greater homogeneity in the
data, as it reduces variation from differences in cell
numbers from individual wells. the normalized ip formation was determined as a percentage of ip formation ratio
compared with that obtained with buffer alone and referred
to as 100% [15].
2.5. facs analysis
the cellular expression of wild-type 5-ht2b-gfp and
r393x-5-ht2b-gfp was measured by flow cytometry using
10 ag/ml of fitc-conjugated anti-flag m2 antibody
(sigma). facs analysis was performed on a facscan flow
cytometer using the cellquest software (becton dickinson).

seeded the day before the analysis on 22 mm round glass
coverslips, and grown for 18 h in a co2 incubator. cells were
rinsed in dmem/f12 (life technologies) and the coverslips
were placed in a 1-ml chamber with 200 al of culture
medium. experiments were performed at 37j on a temperature-controlled stage. cells were observed on a mrc 1024
confocal microscope (bio-rad laboratories, hemel hempstead, hertfordshire, united kingdom) fitted on an axiovert
100 inverted microscope (zeiss, oberkochen, germany)
equipped with a plan-neofluark 40 x/1.3 oil immersion
objective (zeiss). the 488-nm excitation beam of an argonkrypton laser and a 522/32 nm band-pass emission filter
were used for selective viewing of the green fluorochrome.
fields of interest (512  512 pixels) were selected visually.
the gray scale datasets generated were transferred to an
indyk workstation (silicon graphics, mountain view, ca)
running the imagespacek software (molecular dynamics,
sunnydale, ca). no labeling was observed on untransfected
cho-k1 (data not shown). figures were prepared on a
power mack (apple, cupertino, ca) running freehandk
(macromedia, san francisco, ca) and illustratork (adobe,
san francisco, ca) softwares.
2.7. aequorin-based functional assay
the functional response to 5-ht (sigma) and bw723c86
(tocris), a selective 5-ht2b agonist, was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described [16]. cells
were collected from plates with ca2 + and mg2 +-free pbs
supplemented with 5 mm edta, pelleted for 2 min at
1000  g, resuspended in dmem at a density of 5  106
cells/ml and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of 5
am coelenterazine h (molecular probes, eugene, or). cells
were diluted 5-fold before use. agonists in a volume of 50
al dmem were added to 50 al of the cell suspension (50,000
cells) and luminescence was measured for 30 s in a eg and g

(graphpad software) using nonlinear regression applied to a
sigmoidal dose – response model.

nitrogen. protein concentration was determined by the folin
method.
2.9. binding assays
saturation binding assays were performed in triplicate in
polyethylene minisorp tubes (nunc) containing binding
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.4, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx  and 4
mm cacl2), wild-type and mutant  xxxg1114xxx  membrane
extracts (40 ag protein/tube), 0.2 to 10 nm [n-methyl-3h] xxxd2527xxx  ([3h]-lsd; amersham pharmacia). total binding was measured in the absence of competitor and nonspecific binding was measured with at least
200-fold excess of 5-ht. the samples were incubated in a
final volume of 0.25 ml for 30 min at 37 jc and then filtered
on gf/c filters presoaked in 0.5% pei (polyethylenimine)
using a multiple membrane filter set-up (linca lamon
instrumentation, tel aviv, israel). filters were washed three
times with 4 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, dried, and bound
[n-methyl-3h]- xxxd2527xxx  was measured by
liquid scintillation counting. maximal binding capacity
(bmax) and dissociation constant (kd) were determined by
non-linear regression using a single-site model (prism,
graph pad software, san diego).

3. results
3.1. mutation analysis
we investigated whether mutations in the human 5-ht2b
gene could be implicated in the development of pph after
intake of anorexigens by sequencing the whole coding
region of the 5-ht2b gene in our cohort of 10 patients. we
found a heterozygous mutation in one patient, a white
belgian female diagnosed with pph at the age of 50 years,
5 years after her last uptake of anorexigens. she had used
fenfluramine and diethylpropion at recommended anorexic
doses for a cumulated time of nine months. the mutation
consisted of a c to t transition resulting in the substitution of
a stop codon in place of an arginine codon at position 393 of

2.8. preparation of membrane extracts
cho-k1 cells stably expressing wild type 5-ht2b and
r393x mutant were cultured to 90% cell confluence. the
medium was removed and the cells were scraped from the
plates in ca+ + and mg+ +-free phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs). the cells were then centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 g
and the pellets were resuspended in buffer a (15 mm trishcl ph 7.5; 2 mm mgcl2; 0.3 mm edta; 1 mm egta)
and homogenized in a glass homogenizer. the crude membrane fraction was collected by two consecutive centrifugation steps at 40,000  g for 25 min separated by a washing
step in buffer a. the final pellet was resuspended in buffer b
(7.5 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5; 12.5 mm mgcl2; 0.3 mm edta;
1 mm egta; 250 mm sucrose) and flash frozen in liquid

apoaequorin and wild-type 5-ht2b was tested following addition of serotonin (5-ht) and a 5-ht2b agonist (bw723c86). the luminescent signal resulting
from the activation of the apoaequorin-coelenterazine complex was recorded for 30 s in a luminometer. results were analysed by nonlinear regression using the

state and following addition of 5-ht in saturating concentration. results were expressed as a normalized ratio between the radioactivity collected in the ip
fraction over the radioactivity recovered from the solubilised cellular membranes. the normalized ip production was determined as an increase in the ip

the predicted protein sequence (r393x). this mutation
resulted in the truncation of most of the carboxy-terminal
tail of the receptor, removing putative palmitoylation and
phosphorylation sites as well as the pdz binding motif [11]
(fig. 1). this mutation was not found in 160 control alleles.
5-ht2b gene sequencing in 18 pph or pah patients with no
reported history of appetite-suppressant intake revealed no
further mutation.
sequencing of the whole coding sequence and intron –

(r393x), plasmids encoding wt5-ht2b, r393x mutant,
and wt5-ht2b or r393x fused to a green fluorescent
protein (gfp) or flag epitope were transfected in chok1 cells stably expressing the reporter protein apoaequorin.
mixed populations of transfected cells were used for testing
surface expression, binding, and functional properties of the
receptors.
the binding parameters (bmax and kd) of mixed cell
populations expressing wt5-ht2b or r393x mutant receptor were determined by a saturation binding assay, using
lsd as tracer. no specific lsd binding was observed on
control cho cells transfected with the empty vector. as
shown in fig. 2a and table 1, wt5-ht2b and r393x bound
lsd with similar affinity (1.99 f 0.62 nm and 2.24 f 0.30
nm, respectively) and displayed similar expression levels
(bmax of 1.10 f 0.02 and 1.43 f 0.09 pmol/mg proteins,
respectively). pools of transfected cho-k1 cells expressing
wt5-ht2b-gfp or r393x-gfp were also assayed for total
receptor expression by facs analysis. as shown in fig. 2b,
both constructs were expressed at similar level. the subcellular distribution of wt5-ht2b-gfp and r393x-gfp was
also similar, as analyzed by confocal microscopy (fig. 2c).
both fusion proteins were detected at the plasma membrane,
although a fraction of the receptor was seen intracellularly.
3.3. r393x mutant can not activate intracellular signaling
we next tested the ability of these non-clonal cell populations expressing wt5-ht2b and r393x to trigger intracellular calcium release using the aequorin assay. as shown
in fig. 3a and table 1, 5-ht and bw723c86, a selective
agonist for 5-ht2b, elicit a robust increase of intracellular
calcium in cells expressing wt5-ht2b, characterized by ec50
of 4.34 and 3.09 nm, respectively. a similar functional
response to 5-ht was found in cells expressing wt5-ht2bgfp and wt5-ht2b-flag (fig. 3b), whereas no response
was observed in cells expressing r393x or transfected with
vector only, up to 1 am of either agonist (fig. 3c).

r393x-expressing cells was the consequence of a higher

terminal domain of receptors was used to compare the
results of functional assays with cell surface expression.
different concentrations of the various plasmid constructs
were transfected in cos cells and assayed after 48 h for ip
production and facs analysis. as shown in fig. 4a, basal ip
production was not different between the various concentrations of wt5-ht2b, r393x, or control plasmids, demonstrating that neither wt5-ht2b nor r393x mutant presented
a constitutive activity in cos cells. by contrast, a significant
increase of ip production could be seen for metabotropic
 xxxg981xxx  1a, known to display robust constitutive
activity (data not shown). also, consistent with the results of
aequorin assays, only cells expressing wt5-ht2b but not
r393x showed an increase of ip production in response to 1
am 5-ht (fig. 4a) despite similar percentages of gfppositive cells (fig. 4b) and cell surface receptor expression
as detected by a monoclonal antibody against the flag
epitope (fig. 4c).
3.4. r393x mutant produces no dominant negative effect
to investigate whether r393x has a dominant negative
effect on wt5-ht2b function, we co-transfected various
concentrations of r393x plasmid together with flagwt5-ht2b and assayed wt5ht2b cell surface expression by
facs analysis as well as ip production. receptor cell
surface expression (fig. 5a) or receptor function (fig. 5b)
ruled out a dominant negative effect even following cotransfection of a 3:1 ratio of r393x-wt5-ht2b.

4. discussion
we investigated the 5-ht2b gene in 10 patients who
developed pph after intake of fenfluramines and found a
mutation in one (patient 2, table 1). it truncates most of the
carboxy-terminal tail of the receptor, including the c-terminal
pdz motif (fig. 1). this mutation is rare as it was not found in
a sample of 160 control chromosomes from the same population. in spite of normal expression at the plasma membrane
and of normal agonist binding (table 1; fig. 2), the mutation
causes loss of 5-ht2b function as measured by ip production
(fig. 4a; table 1) and by calcium-dependent aequorin luminescence (fig. 3c). although endogenous receptor expression precluded these experiments to be performed in cultures
of pulmonary vascular cells, our results from cos and cho
cells clearly show that an intact c-terminal tail is necessary
for ip cascade activation, and for calcium release, by 5-ht2b.
the mutated receptor displays no constitutive activity as
compared with the wild-type receptor, and does not produce
a dominant negative effect on the latter in co-transfection
experiments (fig. 5). considering the rarity of the mutation
and of the phenotype, their association is unlikely to result
from chance and indicates that heterozygous, i.e. partial, loss
of 5-ht2b function played a causal role in pph disease
progression at least in this patient.

fenfluramines are transported by the 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) into the cytoplasm of  xxxg2150xxx -expressing cells, where
they release 5-ht from storage vesicles [7]. 5-ht produces
a globally vasoconstrictive effect on pulmonary arteries in
most species studied [18 – 20]. the wild-type  xxxg1114xxx  subtype, however, elicits a reversible endotheliumdependent relaxation of pulmonary arteries in pigs, associated with an increase in  xxxd1274xxx  [9], through coupling to
the  xxxd2738xxx  (no) signalling pathway [11]. the pdz
motif at the c-terminus of 5-ht2b is required for activation
of enos [11]. the  xxxg1114xxx  is furthermore coupled
to g-protein gq and intracellular calcium release [8], and
the calcium/calmodulin complex is thought to activate
enos in at least some vascular beds [21]. as the r393x
mutation abolishes calcium release and removes the pdz
motif, we conclude that the mutated receptor has lost its
ability to stimulate enos. expression of the enos enzyme
is decreased in pph both at mrna and protein level to an
extent that is inversely proportional to vascular resistance
[22]. therefore, maximal stimulation of enos by 5-ht2b
might be a limiting factor, consistent with a model where
imbalances in the endothelial production of vasodilators and
vasoconstrictors play a significant role in pph disease
progression [23]. of note, the  xxxg1114xxx  is strongly
overexpressed in pulmonary arteries of pph patients [10].
we speculate that this strong overexpression is a secondary
event that partially counterbalances the vasoconstrictive
effect of 5-ht, and that susceptibility to fenfluramines
was increased in our patient because of the heterozygous
loss of function. homozygous 5-ht2b loss-of-function
mutations are not expected in pph patients, whose phenotype is normal at birth and in infancy, in view of the severe
congenital cardiomyopathy in homozygous 5-ht2b knockout mice [24].
it remains uncertain which receptor subtype mediates
pulmonary vasoconstriction by 5-ht. both the 5-ht1b and
5-ht2a receptors are expressed in human small muscular
pulmonary arteries, and both have been implicated in
vasoconstriction [20,25]. in mice chronically submitted to
hypoxia, a model which shares features with pph, 5-ht2b
was shown to be required for smooth muscle cell proliferation and structural remodeling of pulmonary arteries [10],
consistent with the ability of 5-ht2b to initiate cell cycle
progression in mouse fibroblasts [26]. in that model 5-ht2b
was furthermore required for the potentiation of ph by
dexfenfluramine [10]. if this myoproliferative effect of 5ht2b is relevant to human smooth muscle cells from pph
patients, we hypothesize that it can be produced by one
allele only, i.e. that it is not haploinsufficient, although no
data are reported in heterozygous mice [10]. it is hence not
excluded that the  xxxg1114xxx , besides endotheliumdependent vasodilation, also participated in pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells proliferation or remodeling in
our patient. this hypothesis could not be tested because our
patient’s lungs were explanted years before the present
study, and were hence not available for analysis.

a germline bmpr2 mutation can be detected in up to
30% of patients with apparently sporadic pph [6]. no
mutation of this gene was found in our five patients exposed
to fenfluramines. although bmpr2 and 5-ht2b mutations
might theoretically be associated with distinct subgroups of
pph patients, these genes are more likely part of a complex
network of signalling pathways where several, non-mutually
exclusive mutations may predispose to pph. indeed,
bmpr2 mutations have been found in some patients with
fenfluramine-triggered pph [27]. of note, these patients had
a mean duration of exposure to fenfluramine of less than 3
months, while the patient in the present study reported a 9month exposure (table 1). more importantly, bmpr-ii [28]
and bmpr-ia [29] protein expression at the plasma membrane of pulmonary endothelial cells is decreased not only
in hereditary pph with germline bmpr2 mutations but also
in non-hereditary pph and in secondary ph cases, highlighting the essential role of the bmp/tgf-h/smad pathway [30] in possibly all forms of ph. experimentally, bmps
suppress proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells from normal controls but not from pph patients [31].
we assume that these changes were present in our patient
with the 5-ht2b mutation, but her explanted lungs were not
available for study.
a frequent polymorphism of the  xxxg2150xxx  gene increases
the expression of  xxxg2150xxx  in pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells, and is associated with pph, albeit not specifically with
appetite-suppressant-associated pph [32]. a search for polymorphisms in candidate serotonergic genes, followed by
genetic association studies, should address whether some
multigenic variability in 5-ht signalling predisposes to pph.
