background: dopamine replacement therapies (levodopa, dopamine
receptor agonists, anticholinergics,  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors, and
 xxxg487xxx  inhibitors) remain the cornerstones of therapeutic
interventions for parkinson’s disease (pd). despite the treatment options for
pd symptoms, a cure remains elusive. an optimal treatment would be
one that combined relief in both motor and nonmotor symptoms with
neuroprotective properties.  xxxd3158xxx  is an investigational drug for pd
currently in development as add-on therapy to both dopamine agonists and
levodopa.  xxxd3158xxx  is a unique molecule with a novel mode of action,
targeting both dopaminergic and glutaminergic systems, and potentially
provides motor symptom control. preliminary results from experimental
models suggest potential neuroprotective effects. studies on the potential
effects on nonmotor symptoms are ongoing. objective: to review the
mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the available
clinical safety and efficacy results of  xxxd3158xxx . methods: a search of the
electronic database medline (pubmed, no time limits) was performed on
14 december 2007. the full text of all citations was obtained for review.
furthermore, two abstracts on  xxxd3158xxx  published as proceedings of a
european conference were reviewed. results/conclusion:  xxxd3158xxx  is a
promising investigational drug for pd with a novel mode of action. early
reports confirm the potential efficacy of  xxxd3158xxx  in pd. further studies
on potential effects on cognition and neuroprotection are needed.

introduction

parkinson’s disease: epidemiology, presentation and
pathophysiology

1.1

idiopathic parkinson’s disease (pd) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder
that is prevalent worldwide. incidence increases sharply with age, with approximately
1 in 200 people over 70 years of age suffering from the disease [1].
pd is clinically characterised by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and gait
disturbances. progressive clinical impairment occurs, usually over a 10- to 15-year
period, reflecting the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in a significant loss of dopamine (da)
in the striatum. da replacement therapy, able to improve motor symptoms of pd,
remains the backbone of antiparkinson therapy [2]. however, as pd progresses,
further symptoms appear that either do not respond to dopaminergic replacement
therapy or are related to levodopa treatment. disabling dyskinesias and motor
fluctuations are often referred to as da-related symptoms of pd, even though
these complications are likely to be a consequence of underlying nigrostriatal
degeneration, revealed by exposure to dopaminergic treatment [3-5].

1.2

overview of the market

satisfactory approaches to relieve late symptoms and to slow
the progression of the disease (i.e., by protecting dopaminergic
neurons from premature death) have not yet been developed.
although promising results have been experimentally obtained
with several classes of drugs [6,7], the challenge remains to show
a clinical proof of arrest or delay neuron loss in pd.
current symptomatic treatment relies on levodopa, da
agonists,  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b) inhibitors, and
 xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibitors that compensate for the deficit in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic input
pathways, but it is now accepted that several other factors
contribute to disease progression. these include oxidative
stress with free-radical production [8], neuroinflammation [9],
alterations in the ubiquitin-proteasome system leading
to apoptosis [10], mitochondrial dysfunctions [11], and
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity [12].
although efficacious, long-term levodopa treatment can elicit
a number of debilitating side effects, such as dyskinesias and
motor fluctuations. these side effects are exacerbated by dose
and duration of levodopa treatment; thus treatment options that
delay and minimise the need for levodopa are desirable [13,14].
 xxxg487xxx  inhibitors can be added to
levodopa/carbidopa treatment. these drugs prevent the
conversion of levodopa to 3-o-methyldopa in the gut by
comt, thus increasing the levels of unmetabolised levodopa
reaching the substantia nigra. however, comt inhibitors
can induce dyskinesia in susceptible patients [14].
monotherapy with da agonists has proven effective in
the treatment of early pd and, as such, can permit a significant
delay in the need to prescribe levodopa. in patients treated
initially with da agonists such as  xxxd3145xxx  or pramipexole,
the  xxxg2149xxx  decrement or reduction [15,16] of
f-18-dopa uptake in the striatum was less severe than in
patients treated initially with levodopa [17]. however, recent
concerns arise from the use of da agonists, since ergolinic
da agonists potentially induce endocarditic vegetations [18,19]
and all da agonists, including non-ergolinic da agonists
such as pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx , can induce sleep
attacks and oedema of the lower extremities and lead to
compulsive disorders [20-23].
another approach in pd treatment is the use of inhibitors
of mao-b, one of the key enzymes responsible for the
metabolism of dopamine in the brain. mao-b inhibitors
increase levels of dopamine at the synapses and improve pd
motor symptoms. there is also evidence of neuroprotective
properties with some mao-b inhibitors [24].
the first mao-b inhibitor to be widely used for pd was
selegiline, which irreversibly binds to mao-b. selegiline has
been demonstrated to improve overall symptom control
compared with placebo but effects on dyskinesias are
equivocal, with dyskinesias being worsened in one study
and unaffected in another trial [25-27]. there are some
drawbacks to selegiline: at high doses selegiline loses its
selectivity, also inhibiting mao-a [24]; the bioavailability is
1116

low; the drug shows extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism [28];
and it is structurally related to  xxxd163xxx  so that it is
metabolised to  xxxd2589xxx -based compounds, implicated
in cardiovascular toxicity, including hypertension [24].
rasagiline is an irreversible mao-b inhibitor that is more
selective than selegiline [29]. it has recently received approval
in europe (2005) and the united states (2006) for the
treatment of pd. it is not structurally related to  xxxd163xxx 
and therefore does not exhibit the side effects associated
with selegiline. the efficacy of rasagiline has been demonstrated as an adjunct to levodopa and as monotherapy
for early-stage pd [27,30-32]. despite the well-documented
‘selectivity’ of rasagiline for mao-b, the manufacturer
recommends virtually all dietary and drug restrictions
required for nonselective mao inhibitors [29].
another drug used in the treatment of pd is amantadine,
which shows its greatest effect on the treatment of
dyskinesia [33-38]. recent evidence suggests that it may also
have neuroprotective properties through its ability to block
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which have been implicated
in neurodegeneration by mediating excitotoxicity in the
basal ganglia [39]. adverse effects associated with amantadine
include altered mental status, lower-extremity oedema and
livedo reticularis [14,38].
anticholinergics can produce benefits in the treatment of
pd-related tremor in combination with levodopa. however,
they are associated with certain adverse effects, including dry
mouth and cognitive impairment, limiting their use [14,40].
1.3

drugs under development

newer compounds in late clinical development are fipamezole
(an alpha-2 receptor antagonist),  xxxd3279xxx  (an ampa-kainate
receptor antagonist), istradephylline and biibo14 (adenosine
receptor a2a antagonists), pardoprunox (a non-ergolinic da
agonist), methylphenidate (a mild cns stimulant), ns 2330
(tesofensine, a monoamine reuptake inhibitor) and atomoxetine
hcl (a noradrenaline reuptake selective inhibitor). isradipine
(a calcium channel blocker) has recently been used in pd.
these molecules are theoretically targeted to address motor
fluctuations and dyskinesias and to provide neuroprotection.

 xxxd3158xxx 

2.1

introduction to the compound and chemistry

 xxxd3158xxx , (s)-(+)-2-[4-(3-fluorobenzyloxybenzylamino)propanamide]methanesulfonate (1:1 salt) (figure 1), is an orally
available derivative of the chemical class of alpha-aminoamides,
with multiple mechanisms of action and experimental evidence
of symptomatic and neuroprotective potential [41]. its potency,
broad spectrum of activity, and safety profile led to  xxxd3158xxx 
being investigated for the treatment of epilepsy and pd.
 xxxd3158xxx  inhibits mao-b and da reuptake [42], resulting
in relief of pd symptoms. in addition,  xxxd3158xxx  blocks
voltage-dependent sodium channels, modulates calcium
channels and inhibits glutamate release induced by abnormal

neuronal activity, all of which may provide improvements in
cognition and neuroprotective properties [43,44].
2.1.1

dopamine modulation

mao catalyses the major inactivation pathway for the
catecholamine neurotransmitters, including da. two distinct
isoforms of mao have been identified: mao-a and mao-b.
mao-a preferentially deaminates noradrenaline and
serotonin while mao-b shows affinity for dopamine and
phenylethylamine. monoamines (e.g., da) are substrates of
both isoforms; however, in humans, more than 80% of
da is metabolised by mao-b. while reversible inhibitors
of mao-a have been indicated in the treatment of depression,
the selective inhibition of mao-b has a therapeutic role in
the treatment of pd [24,45].
unspecific inhibition of mao results in unmetabolised
dietary amines entering the circulatory system, where they
induce noradrenaline release from peripheral adrenergic
neurons, resulting in a severe and potentially fatal hypertensive
response. to avoid this ‘cheese effect’, mao-b inhibitors
with high selectivity have been called for [24].
 xxxd3158xxx  is a da modulator that exhibits potent, highly
selective and reversible mao-b inhibition (full inhibition in
human platelets at 0.6 mg/kg orally) [46]; its selectivity for
mao-b is superior to selegiline and rasagiline. in binding studies in rat brain mitochondria in vitro,  xxxd3158xxx  demonstrated
5000 times greater selectivity for mao-b than for mao-a
(based on ic50 values in a radioenzymatic assay) compared
with 127 times and 103 times greater selectivity for mao-b
over mao-a with selegiline and rasagiline, respectively [46-48].
this level of selectivity may omit the need for any dietary
restrictions with  xxxd3158xxx  use (i.e., to avoid the ‘cheese
effect’), although this remains to be verified [49].
in addition to its selectivity, mao-b inhibition by
 xxxd3158xxx  is fully reversible:  xxxd3158xxx  does not form the
irreversible covalent bonds with mao-b that are associated
with selegiline and rasagiline [50]. this is an important
advantage for patients who experience adverse events that
need to be treated with other drugs, as the reversibility of
 xxxd3158xxx  avoids potential drug interactions [49].
2.1.2

sodium channel inhibition

 xxxd3158xxx  has demonstrated in rat cortical membranes high
affinity for the sodium channel binding site ii.  xxxd3158xxx 

inhibits the fast sodium currents in a concentration- and
state-dependent manner. at depolarised membrane potentials,
when a large number of channels are in the inactivated state,
mimicking neuronal pathologic conditions,  xxxd3158xxx  is
three times more potent (ic50 = 33 µm) than at resting
potential (ic50 = 96 µm), suggesting a preferential
interaction with the inactivated state of the channel [46].
therefore, in the presence of  xxxd3158xxx , a much higher
proportion of sodium channels is kept in the inactivated
state and prevented from activating. in addition, the blockade
of sodium currents by  xxxd3158xxx  is use-dependent, meaning
that an enhancement of the blockade occurs during highfrequency stimulation when many channels are in the
inactivated state. this effect results in depression of neuronal
activity at high-frequency firing and ineffectiveness at a
normal firing rate. this effect also suggests that
 xxxd3158xxx  selectively depresses abnormal activity, leaving
physiologic activity unaffected and thus avoiding cns
depressant effects [46].
 xxxd3158xxx  inhibits the action potential firing in
cortical neurons, slowing recovery from the inactivation
state and thus reducing channel availability for subsequent
sodium spikes [46].
2.1.3

calcium channel modulation

in rat cortical neurons,  xxxd3158xxx  also inhibited n-type
calcium currents (ic50 = 23 µm) [46], suggesting that it
might participate in the inhibition of neurotransmitter
presynaptic release (e.g., excitatory amino acids), mostly
influenced by the activation of n-type calcium channels. in vivo,
l-type calcium channels are not affected by  xxxd3158xxx ,
as demonstrated by the lack of effects by  xxxd3158xxx 
(up to 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally in the pithed rat) on
blood pressure and heart rate or on the pressor response
to noradrenaline [46].
2.1.4

glutamate release inhibition

in rat hippocampal synaptosomes,  xxxd3158xxx  inhibits glutamate
release induced by depolarising conditions (ic50 = 9 µm).
at high potassium concentrations, the release of the
neurotransmitter is calcium-mediated. therefore  xxxd3158xxx ,
by blocking the n-type calcium mobilisation, inhibits
glutamate release, one of the most relevant excitotoxic inputs
leading to neuronal death [46].

2.2

neuroprotection

it is possible that mao-b inhibition prevents formation
of toxins or free radicals formed by oxidative processes.
this is demonstrated with all three drugs, selegiline, rasagiline
and  xxxd3158xxx , by using the n-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (mptp) model. mptp is a neurotoxin that
is metabolised by mao-b to the active toxin mpp+, which
causes pd-like symptoms in humans and is selectively toxic
to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in animals.
the three drugs prevented mptp from being oxidised to
mpp+ [46] and therefore obviously prevented the neurotoxic
effect of mpp+.
in clinical trials, results of the deprenyl and tocopherol
antioxidative therapy of parkinsonism (datatop) study [51]
assessing the potential neuroprotective properties of selegiline
were disappointing, whereas, according to the results of
the tvp-1012 in early monotherapy for parkinson’s disease
outpatients (tempo) trial [30], rasagiline seems to be
more promising, although the significant improvement of
the unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) total
score is not clinically relevant.
neuroprotective properties of  xxxd3158xxx , independent of
mao-b inhibition, have been investigated in models in vitro
and in vivo. these include prevention of in vitro veratridineinduced neuronal cell death through sodium and calcium
channel inhibition, protection of hippocampal neuronal loss
induced by the glutamate analogue kainic acid in rats, and a
neuro-rescuing effect on ischaemia-induced hippocampal
neuronal death in gerbils [46].
2.3

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

preclinical pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in
mice, rats and monkeys [46].  xxxd3158xxx  has a high oral
1118

bioavailability (80 – 92%), is rapidly absorbed and after
reaching peak levels in plasma within 0.5 – 2 h declines,
with a terminal half-life of about 3, 7 and 13 h in mice, rats
and monkeys, respectively. brain levels of  xxxd3158xxx  are
always higher than the corresponding plasma concentrations,
with a brain:plasma ratio of 16, 16 and 9 in mice, rats and
monkeys, respectively. at current pharmacological doses, the
brain levels of  xxxd3158xxx  are expected to be in the high
micromolar range.
assuming for humans the same brain:plasma ratio as for
monkeys (i.e., 9), plasma levels of 5 – 6 µm, which are seen in
humans at steady state after 7 days of an oral dose of 150 mg,
should correspond to brain levels of 40 – 50 µm [46].
pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 97 healthy volunteers
enrolled in phase i studies showed that  xxxd3158xxx  absorption
is rapid (passive diffusion) after single or multiple oral
dosing under fasting conditions, reaching tmax in 1.8 – 2.8 h
[c caccia, pers. commun.]. food intake delays the
absorption of the drug (tmax = ∼ 5 h), without affecting its
extent. the elimination half-life is in the range of 21 – 24 h,
allowing once-daily administration. the auc∞ acute or aucsstau
steady-state and cmax increased linearly in a dose-proportional
manner (dose-linearity and dose-proportionality were both
demonstrated for  xxxd3158xxx ), both indicative of first-order
kinetics (figure 2) [52].
the apparent oral volume of distribution of the unchanged
drug is approximately 150 l, indicative of extensive extravascular
distribution, in agreement with the high lipophilicity of
the  xxxd3158xxx  base, and a plasma protein binding (92%)
apparently lower than the extravascular tissue binding [52].
 xxxd3158xxx  appears to be extensively biotransformed.
unchanged  xxxd3158xxx  in urine and faeces respectively
accounted for 7 – 10% and 1.5% of the administered dose,

pharmacokinetic data showed no relevant accumulation
with  xxxd3158xxx  at steady state. from data obtained from
in vitro experiments, no relevant interactions were found in
oxidative metabolic pathways controlled by cyp2c9,
cyp2c19, cyp2d6, cyd2e1 and cyp3a4 [52].
studies on healthy volunteers, which focused on single
ascending oral doses of the drug (2.5 mg/kg – 10.0 mg/kg)
or on repeated oral doses, confirmed the linear kinetics of
 xxxd3158xxx  [53,54].
after a single oral administration of  xxxd3158xxx , the main
components observed in plasma were the unchanged drug
and two metabolites, the ‘ xxxd3158xxx  acid’ (nw-1153) and
the n-dealkylated acid (nw-1689). in urine, the main
metabolites were the  xxxd3158xxx  acid and the glucuronide of
the n-dealkylated acid. based on plasma and urine data,
the main phase i enzymes involved in human  xxxd3158xxx 
metabolism are amide hydrolases and mao-a. the main
phase ii enzyme involved is a glucuronyltransferase.
2.4

clinical efficacy of  xxxd3158xxx 

two published studies show the efficacy of  xxxd3158xxx  in
patients with pd [55,56].
a three-month, placebo-controlled study was conducted
on 172 patients with early pd to investigate the effects of
 xxxd3158xxx  on motor function [55]. the average age of
participants was approximately 59 years, 64% were male
and the mean duration of pd was approximately 30 months.
around 50% of patients had a hoehn and yahr stage of 2, and
the mean updrs-iii score at baseline was approximately 17.
there were no systematic or statistically significant differences

for all three treatment groups for any demographic or disease
severity variable. patients were required to follow a tyraminerestricted diet. patients were randomised to receive placebo,
low-dose  xxxd3158xxx  (0.5 mg/kg) or high-dose  xxxd3158xxx 
(1 mg/kg) (5 capsules to be taken daily, fasted, at 8 a.m.).
the high dose was calculated as the dose that would mediate
blockage of glutamate release and ion channels, while the
low dose was calculated to provide complete mao-b
inhibition. responders were defined as those patients with
≥ 30% improvement in updrs-iii scores at the end of
the study versus baseline. at the end of the study, 37.5%
of patients receiving high-dose  xxxd3158xxx  (median dose
70 mg/day) responded to treatment compared with 21.4%
of the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.02), with a mean
motor score decrease of 3.3 (p < 0.05 compared with
baseline) (table 1) [55].
 xxxd3158xxx  was also administered in this study as
adjunctive therapy to a subgroup of patients (n = 101) who
were already on a stable, single dose of da agonist
(apomorphine, n = 1; bromocriptine, n = 9; cabergoline,
n = 8; pergolide, n = 31; piribedil, n = 4; pramipexole, n = 32;
 xxxd3145xxx , n = 16). patients receiving  xxxd3158xxx  (1 mg/kg) as
adjunctive therapy showed a significant increase in response
compared with placebo (47.1% vs 20.6%, p = 0.02), with a
mean motor score decrease of 4.7 (p < 0.05, table 1) [55].
the study demonstrated a robust symptomatic effect with
the higher dose of  xxxd3158xxx . the study was well designed,
being focused on a specific cut-off of 30% that was
based on the known placebo effect observed in pd [57].
the placebo effect in the study, however, was higher than
usually observed, as some 20% of patients on placebo were
found to be responders.

figure 3. mean changes of updrs-iii (motor function) score (point variations on the ordinate) in patients after addition of
increasing doses of  xxxd3158xxx  to da agonists. patients (n = 14) were on a stable dose of a single da agonist, and every 2 weeks the
initial  xxxd3158xxx  dose of 100 mg/day was increased, to 150 and 200 mg/day.
reproduced with permission from [56].

an unexpected finding was the superior benefit of
 xxxd3158xxx  when added to a single da agonist. the
authors concluded that the ability of  xxxd3158xxx  to block
ion channels and inhibit glutamate release was adding
to the symptomatic effect of mao-b inhibition on
motor function [55].
the other reported study investigating efficacy of
 xxxd3158xxx  was an open-label pilot study, in which doses
of 100, 150 and 200 mg/day were progressively administered
to patients (n = 14) on a stable dose of da agonist
over 6 consecutive weeks [56]. a progressive improvement in
motor performance was observed at the end of the study,
with a 4.2-point decrease in updrs-iii score, changing
from a mean baseline score of 18.0 (in ‘on’ conditions) to a
mean score at week 6 of 13.8 (p < 0.001, figure 3) [56].
significant changes from baseline were observed already
at week 2 (p = 0.02) and at week 4 (p < 0.001).
a different group of patients (n = 11), not overlapping
with the 14-patient group, received  xxxd3158xxx  at the same
dose as adjunctive treatment to levodopa. a significant
decrease was observed in updrs-iv score. at 100 mg/day
there was a 1.2-point decrease (from a mean score of 5.1 to
3.9; p = 0.008) and at 150 mg/day a 3.0-point decrease
(mean score 3.0; p < 0.001) but no further improvement
was seen with 200 mg/day (mean score 2.9; p < 0.001)
(figure 4) [56]. the addition of  xxxd3158xxx  to levodopa
produced a significant progressive augmentation of the levodopa
serum auc (measured using hplc coupled with an
electrochemical detector), ranging from 56% at the 100 mg/day
1120

dose to 88% with 200 mg/day. two patients had their
levodopa dose reduced by a third [56].
several conclusions were drawn from this study. mao-b
inhibition was close to 100% at all doses (evaluated in
platelet-rich plasma by a radioenzyme assay using [14c]-pea
(phenylethylamine) as a selective substrate), and the moderate
increase in da levels (measured using hplc as described by
blandini et al. [58] with slight modifications) of 30% over
baseline remained constant at all dose levels. however,
symptom improvement was observed at each increment of
the  xxxd3158xxx  dose, which suggested that, as hypothesised,
 xxxd3158xxx  has other symptom-relieving effects.
to eliminate the possibility that  xxxd3158xxx  raised
peripheral levodopa levels by inhibiting the main metabolising
enzymes dopadecarboxylase and comt, a separate study
demonstrated that  xxxd3158xxx  had no inhibitory activity
on comt [c caccia, pers. commun.]. this suggested that
 xxxd3158xxx  itself raised levodopa levels by the putative
inhibition of da reuptake in addition to the consequences
of mao-b inhibition.

safety and tolerability

to describe the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
tolerability of  xxxd3158xxx , four clinical trials on healthy male
volunteers were performed using a concentration range of
25 – 10,000 µg/ml.  xxxd3158xxx  was administered in single
(up to 10 mg/kg/day) or repeated doses (5 mg/kg/day) to
steady state and included a food-interaction trial. tolerability
in all four trials proved to be good [52].

reproduced with permission from [56].

in the placebo-controlled patient study [55],  xxxd3158xxx 
was not associated with any tolerability issues. the adverse
events experienced with 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg were lower
than those reported for the placebo group. by body system,
the most common events experienced in the  xxxd3158xxx  arms
were nervous system disorders (11 and 7% of subjects in the
low- and high-dose arms, respectively), gastrointestinal disorders
(5 and 11%), infections and infestations (7 and 7%), skin and
subcutaneous tissue disorders (7 and 4%), general disorders
and administration-site conditions (2 and 5%) and cardiac
disorders (5 and 0%). in the open-label pilot study, doses
up to 200 mg/day were well tolerated, with no serious or
clinically significant adverse events [56].

therefore may provide a level of cognitive improvement
and neuroprotection.
clinical trials have demonstrated that already a low dose
of  xxxd3158xxx  provides full mao-b inhibition [56], suggesting
that the observed dose-dependent biochemical and symptomatic effects may be related to the drug’s additional
mechanisms of action. all studies have demonstrated
good tolerability.
ongoing trials of  xxxd3158xxx  will examine its efficacy
and tolerability as an adjunct to da agonists and levodopa
and other possible effects on nonmotor symptoms, such
as cognition.

the results of a completed phase iii trial of  xxxd3158xxx 
as adjunctive therapy to da agonists are to be published,
and a trial as adjunctive therapy to levodopa is ongoing.
further trials of the lower dose range (50 − 100 mg/day)
of  xxxd3158xxx  as an adjunct to da agonists and levodopa are
planned, and a comprehensive cognition study is anticipated.

conclusion

 xxxd3158xxx  appears to have a multimodal mechanism of
action. it increases levels of available da through highly
selective and reversible mao-b inhibition. however,
 xxxd3158xxx  also has an important and novel mode of action
that results in blockade of sodium channels and modulation
of calcium channels, which inhibits glutamate release and

 xxxd3158xxx  is a promising new drug for the treatment
of pd. compared with other available treatments,  xxxd3158xxx  reaches extraordinarily high cns concentrations [46],
and its selective effect on mao-b could explain its
symptomatic effect on pd symptoms. moreover, its reversible
bond to mao-b offers an option to easily control possible
side effects.
in our personal experience with study protocols of  xxxd3158xxx ,
we had the chance to follow 53 patients randomised to
 xxxd3158xxx  or placebo treatment for as long as 5 years.
despite blinding, we could observe a clear separation between
patients. some patients experienced powerful improve
ments in motor performance, which were higher than the 30%
cut-off set to account for a placebo effect, and confirmed
by standardised assessments (low inter-rater variability).

similarly, drug withdrawal resulted in evident worsening of
motor symptoms.
although we could not unblind the data during the study,
the extent of the effect was surprising, as we had never
observed such a clear separation between patients admitted
to blinded protocols during our investigation of other drugs
(including new da agonists, antiglutamatergic drugs, a2a
antagonists, and mao-b inhibitors).
as  xxxd3158xxx  has no direct dopaminomimetic activity, we
hypothesise that its symptomatic effect is mostly dependent on
the high concentration that this drug reaches in the cns
(with a brain:plasma ratio of 9:1 in primates) and on its
powerful mao-b inhibiting effect.
homeostatic interactions between da and glutamate
are central to the normal physiology of the basal ganglia.
in pd, this relationship is altered, resulting in upregulation
of corticostriatal glutamatergic function in levodopainduced dyskinesias [59]. any drug that can counteract
such unbalance in glutamate function is potentially useful in
controlling dyskinesias [60].
several antiglutamatergic drugs, such as amantadine,
budipine, and memantine, can improve dyskinesia in pd
patients [35,36,61]. in studies in vitro,  xxxd3158xxx  demonstrates
strong antiglutamatergic activity when the release of glutamate
is excessive and seems promising as antidyskinetic treatment.
yet the only available study describing  xxxd3158xxx ’s effects in
levodopa-treated patients reported that levodopa doses were
reduced when  xxxd3158xxx  was added to levodopa [56], which
resulted in reductions in dyskinesias accompanied by updrs
motor improvements. thus, motor improvements could result
from the symptomatic effect of  xxxd3158xxx , while dyskinesia
reduction could result from levodopa reduction.
it is not appropriate, however, to compare these results
with those observed following amantadine adjunctive therapy

1122

in dyskinetic patients, who experienced reduction of
dyskinesias when levodopa levels were left unchanged [38].
the main disadvantage with amantadine is tachyphylaxis, as
antidyskinetic effects almost disappeared during a 12-month
observation period [38].
in order to understand whether the antiglutamatergic
effect of  xxxd3158xxx  might reduce dyskinesias, further
studies should be conducted, replicating the design used
with amantadine. in our opinion we must, however, argue
that the antidyskinetic effects of amantadine are far
from being clearly understood based on pharmacologic
properties, as more recent hypotheses suggest that effects
on dyskinesias might be linked to adenosine a2a
antagonistic properties [62] rather than to the hypothesised
antiglutamatergic effect.
overall,  xxxd3158xxx  shows promising effects (based on
updrs motor scores), which we believe are most likely due
to its high cns bioavailability and high mao-b selectivity.
preliminary studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety.
 xxxd3158xxx  has a unique and diverse pharmacologic
profile and hence appears to be a promising new agent
in the treatment of pd.
