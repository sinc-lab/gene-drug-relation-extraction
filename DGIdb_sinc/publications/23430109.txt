secondary point mutations in the fms-like  xxxg2198xxx  3 ( xxxg801xxx )  xxxg2198xxx

key points

introduction
activating mutations in  xxxg801xxx  are detected in approximately 30%
of adult acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cases. particularly
common are internal tandem duplication (itd) events in the
juxtamembrane domain, which are associated with poor prognosis.1,2 the collective clinical experience with early  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (tkis) in aml was disappointing; responses
were largely limited to transient reductions in peripheral blood
blasts, whereas bone marrow responses were exceedingly rare.3-5
these studies suggested that  xxxg801xxx -itd may represent a “passenger” rather than a “driver” lesion. an alternative explanation is that
“ﬁrst-generation”  xxxg801xxx  tkis failed to achieve sufﬁciently potent
target inhibition in the leukemic cells of patients. recently, a phase
ii study of the second-generation  xxxg801xxx /kit inhibitor  xxxd3069xxx 
( xxxd3069xxx ) demonstrated a composite complete remission rate of
44% to 54% in relapsed and chemotherapy-refractory aml.6,7 in
addition, anecdotal achievement of complete remission in flt3itd1 aml patients treated with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib
on a compassionate use basis has been reported.8 the validity of
 xxxg801xxx -itd as a therapeutic target in human aml was deﬁnitively
demonstrated through translational studies that identiﬁed the evolution of  xxxd3069xxx  resistance–conferring  xxxg801xxx -itd kinase domain

(kd) mutations at the time of acquired resistance in 8/8 flt3itd1 patients analyzed.9 this ﬁnding suggests that, as with
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), secondary mutation in the target
kd is likely to represent a common mechanism of acquired resistance to clinically active tkis and will pose a substantial barrier to
response durability. in further support of this concept, kd mutations have been reported to be associated with acquired resistance to
sorafenib10 and the multikinase inhibitor pkc41211 in flt3itd1 aml patients.
clinically relevant  xxxd3069xxx  resistance–conferring mutations
have thus far been restricted to 2 residues in the  xxxg801xxx  kd, the
“gatekeeper” residue f691 (f691l), and the activation loop (al)
residue  xxxd835xxx  (d835v/y/f). an in vitro mutagenesis screen
identiﬁed mutations at a third al residue, y842 (y842c/h), as
also capable of causing substantial resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  in vitro.9
notably, mutations at all 3 of these residues confer in vitro crossresistance to sorafenib.9,12 substitutions at gatekeeper residues
such as  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691 have been well-documented to confer
resistance to kinase inhibitors in other malignancies, including
egfr-mutated non–small-cell lung cancer, bcr- xxxg23xxx  acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and cml.13,14 analogs of the  xxxg801xxx -itd/d835v

al mutation have also proven problematic for a number of kinase
inhibitors. substitutions at the analogous residue ( xxxd816xxx ) in kit,
commonly associated with systemic mastocytosis, results in pathological kinase activation and confers a high degree of intrinsic
resistance to imatinib and other kit inhibitors.15,16 mutations at
 xxxd835xxx  in  xxxg801xxx -itd have also been implicated recently in clinical
resistance to sorafenib in  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml patients.10
although  xxxd3069xxx  appears to harbor substantial clinical activity in
 xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml, its clinical development has been complicated by
toxicities including qt prolongation and myelosuppression. clinical
trials are currently exploring lower  xxxd3069xxx  doses for retention of
antileukemic activity and improved safety.  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) is
a potent inhibitor of several kinases, including abl and  xxxg801xxx , that
has demonstrated in vitro activity against all drug-resistant bcrabl kd mutants, including the gatekeeper t315i and al h396p
mutations.17,18  xxxd2985xxx  is well-tolerated; has demonstrated significant clinical activity in tki-resistant cml cases, including in
patients with the bcr-abl/t315i mutation19; and was recently
approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment
of cml and  xxxg102xxx  acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with resistance or intolerance to prior tki therapy. in addition,  xxxd2985xxx  has
demonstrated clinical activity in  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml patients in limited
phase i experience. speciﬁcally, 2 of 7 tki-naı̈ve  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml
patients achieved complete remission with incomplete recovery of
blood counts (cri) on 45 mg daily  xxxd2985xxx  therapy.20  xxxd2985xxx 
is orally administered and is not associated with appreciable qt
prolongation. because it retains activity against all tki-resistant
bcr-abl mutants,  xxxd2985xxx  may be similarly effective against all
 xxxg801xxx -itd kd substitutions. no studies have yet assessed the
activity of  xxxd2985xxx  against clinically detected  xxxg801xxx -itd kd
mutants. we therefore sought to test the activity of  xxxd2985xxx  against
 xxxg801xxx -itd kd mutants that have been documented to confer clinical
resistance to  xxxd3069xxx , and to prospectively identify secondary flt3itd kd mutations that can confer resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  in vitro,
which may also confer acquired clinical resistance to this agent in
 xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml patients.

cell viability assay
exponentially growing cells (5 3 103 cells per well) were plated in each well of
a 96-well plate with 0.1 ml of rpmi 1640 1 10% fetal calf serum containing
the appropriate concentration of drug ( xxxd2985xxx ,  xxxd3069xxx , sorafenib, dcc2036) in triplicate. cells were allowed to expand for 2 days, and cellular
proliferation was assessed using celltiter-glo reagent (promega, madison,
wi) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation on a spectramax m3
microplate reader using spectramax pro software (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca). the value at varying concentrations of drug was normalized
to the median value in the no-drug sample for each mutant and a mean value
was calculated. numerical ic50 values were generated using nonlinear best-ﬁt
regression analysis using prism 5 software (graphpad, san diego, ca).
immunoblotting
exponentially growing ba/f3 cells stably expressing mutant isoforms, along
with a native  xxxg801xxx -itd control, were plated in rpmi medium 1640 1 10%
fetal calf serum supplemented with kinase inhibitor at the indicated concentration. after a 90-minute incubation, the cells were washed in phosphatebuffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 10% glycerol, 150
mm nacl, 1% triton x-100, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 1.5 mm mgcl2)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. the lysate was clariﬁed
by centrifugation and quantitated by bca assay (thermo scientiﬁc, rockford,
il). protein was subjected to  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. immunoblotting
was performed using anti–phospho- xxxg801xxx , anti–phospho- xxxg2216xxx , anti- xxxg2216xxx ,
anti–phospho-s6, anti-s6 (cell signaling, beverly, ma), and anti- xxxg801xxx  s18
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).
plasma inhibitory assay

material and methods

plasma inhibitory assay was performed as previously described21 with some
modiﬁcations. brieﬂy, 7 3 106 parental molm14 cells and molm14 cells
harboring the indicated mutations were resuspended in 1 ml of plasma from
either a healthy control or steady-state plasma from a  xxxd2985xxx -treated patient.
plasma was obtained from healthy volunteers and from cml patients treated
on the phase i study of  xxxd2985xxx  (nct00660920) at ucsf. all samples were
collected under the ucsf institutional review board–approved cell-banking
protocol (cc#112514). informed consent was obtained in accordance with
the declaration of helsinki. cells were incubated at 37°c for 2 hours.  xxxg801xxx 
was immunoprecipitated from 400 mg of total protein using anti- xxxg801xxx 
s18 antibody and used for western immunoblotting. remaining lysate was
normalized and used for western immunoblotting as described previously.

inhibitors

model of  xxxd2985xxx  bound to  xxxg801xxx 

 xxxd2985xxx  was a gift of ariad pharmaceuticals (cambridge, ma).  xxxd3069xxx 
and  xxxd3087xxx  were purchased from selleckchem (houston, tx). sorafenib
was purchased from lc laboratories (woburn, ma).

a homology model of  xxxg801xxx  was built based on the crystal structure of kit
bound with imatinib (pdb code: 1t46) by using the protein structure
prediction program prime (schrodinger). a docking grid ﬁle was generated
from this model and  xxxd2985xxx  was docked into the  xxxg801xxx  model using glide
sp (schrodinger) with postdocking minimization. the docked poses of
 xxxd2985xxx  with highest scores revealed similar binding modes, hence the
model of  xxxg801xxx  bound to  xxxd2985xxx  with the best binding score was chosen
for further analysis.

dna constructs, mutagenesis, and resistance screen
random mutagenesis was performed as previously described.9 cells were
selected in 40 nm  xxxd2985xxx  in soft agar. after 10 to 21 days, visible colonies
were plucked and expanded in 10 nm  xxxd2985xxx .
sequencing and alignments
sequencing was performed from ampliﬁed genomic dna from colonies
expanded from soft agar as previously described.9

f691l mutant with an ic50 of 52 nm (table 1 and figure 1a).
consistent with a recent report,22  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691i (analogous to
bcr-abl/t315i), is sensitive to  xxxd2985xxx  at concentrations
equivalent to those required to inhibit native  xxxg801xxx -itd (table 1
and figure 1). although the f691i mutant has been shown to
confer in vitro resistance to a number of  xxxg801xxx  tkis,12 it has not
been implicated in clinical resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  or any other agent
to date. notably,  xxxd2985xxx  was substantially less active against

an in vitro mutagenesis screen of  xxxg801xxx -itd in a clinically
achievable concentration of  xxxd2985xxx  identifies mutations
restricted to the  xxxg801xxx -itd al

to delineate the spectrum of  xxxg801xxx -itd kd mutations that may
potentially cause clinical resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  in an unbiased
manner, we conducted an in vitro saturation mutagenesis screen of
 xxxg801xxx -itd similar to the assay we recently used to successfully
identify clinically relevant  xxxd3069xxx -resistant kd mutations in flt3itd.9 resistant clones were selected in 40 nm  xxxd2985xxx , which is
less than the trough concentrations safely achieved in patients in
a phase i study19 and is identical to the concentration used in
a similar study of bcr-abl.17 a screen of 50 independently derived
clones revealed mutations at 3 al residues ( xxxd835xxx  [n 5 31],  xxxd839xxx 
[n 5 3], and y842 [n 5 16]), which confer varying degrees of
resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  (figure 2a). d835v, d835y, y842c, and
y842h substitutions identiﬁed in this screen were also isolated in
a previous screen using 20 nm  xxxd3069xxx . although d835v and y
mutants are highly resistant to both  xxxd3069xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx , y842
substitutions confer intermediate resistance to these inhibitors
(table 1 and figure 2b-c) and have not been identiﬁed in clinical
samples to date. the d835h mutation was also recovered with
 xxxd2985xxx  and was found to confer moderate resistance to  xxxd2985xxx 
but relatively minimal resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  (table 1). in addition, at
low frequency, the d839g mutation was identiﬁed, which conferred
mild resistance to both drugs (table 1 and figure 2b-c). the
clinically relevant f691l mutation, which was notably the most
common substitution (.50% of resistant clones) identiﬁed in our
previous saturation mutagenesis screen for  xxxd3069xxx  resistance,9 was
not recovered in 40 nm  xxxd2985xxx , even though d839g and f691l
appear to confer a similar mild degree of relative resistance to
 xxxd2985xxx  in vitro (table 1 and figure 2b-c).

expressing the  xxxg801xxx -itd mutant isoforms indicated. cells were exposed to  xxxd2985xxx 
at the indicated concentrations for 90 minutes.

in anticipation that  xxxd2985xxx  may be clinically useful in patients who
develop resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  as a result of acquired f691l mutations
(provided adequate drug levels can be attained in vivo to inhibit this
mutant), we sought to determine whether  xxxg801xxx  al mutations identiﬁed in our mutagenesis screen could impart increased relative
resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  when found in conjunction with  xxxg801xxx -itd/
f691l. we created ba/f3 cell lines containing  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691l
and substitutions at  xxxg801xxx  al residues ( xxxd835xxx ,  xxxd839xxx , and y842)
on the same allele, and determined the ic50 values for proliferation compared with  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691l alone. all
compound f691l-al mutants assessed conferred a high degree of
resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  (table 2), including substitutions that conferred only mild to moderate resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  in the setting of
 xxxg801xxx -itd alone. these data suggest that compound  xxxg801xxx -itd/
f691l al mutations (and perhaps other compound mutations as
well) will likely cause acquired clinical resistance to  xxxd2985xxx  in
some  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml patients who have developed resistance to
prior tki therapy.

modeling of  xxxg801xxx - xxxd2985xxx  interactions

to understand the potential structural effects of secondary  xxxg801xxx  kd
mutations on  xxxd2985xxx  binding, we used a docking model of
 xxxd2985xxx  bound to  xxxg801xxx , based on the crystal structure of the close
homolog kit bound with imatinib.23 in this model,  xxxd2985xxx  is
shown to bind to the inactive form of  xxxg801xxx  in a dfg-out binding
mode and occupies three major pockets, including the atp pocket,
the hydrophobic pocket located behind the gatekeeper residue, and
the extended hydrophobic pocket near the dfg motif. we ﬁrst
sought to understand the effects of mutations at the f691 residue on
 xxxd2985xxx ’s activity from a structural perspective. as illustrated in
table 1,  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits native and f691i mutant- xxxg801xxx  with
similar potencies but has reduced activity against the f691l
gatekeeper mutant. the gatekeeper residue f691 in native  xxxg801xxx 
does not block the hydrophobic pocket located near the residue. this
is demonstrated in both the crystal structure of auto-inhibited flt324
and in our homology model, where the phenylalanine adopts a
similar conformation and is folded back from the atp binding site,

forming the bottom of this hydrophobic pocket. no conformational
change of f691 appears to be necessary to accommodate  xxxd2985xxx 
binding to  xxxg801xxx  where the side chain of f691 and the 2-methylphenyl
substituent of  xxxd2985xxx  are oriented in a parallel fashion and make
strong hydrophobic interactions (figure 3a). when the f691
residue is mutated to isoleucine, the side chain of isoleucine can
easily adopt a similar conformation to that of f691, particularly in
the hydrophobic pocket, without introducing signiﬁcant protein
structural changes or obstructing inhibitor binding (figure 3a-b).
conversely, mutation of f691 to leucine is expected to have a more
direct steric inﬂuence on  xxxd2985xxx  binding because of the presence
of a terminal sp3 carbon-branched side chain in leucine compared
with the ﬂat phenylalanine side chain (figure 3a,c). indeed, minor
steric clashes with inhibitor are observed in the f691l, but not the
f691i, model of  xxxg801xxx  bound with  xxxd2985xxx  (figure 3b-c).
furthermore, because the hydrophobic nature of the side chain is
maintained in this phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution, reinforcement of the hydrophobic spine with resultant stabilization of the
active conformation that leads to autoactivation, as reported in
the case of t315i abl,25 is unlikely to play a dominant role in
inﬂuencing kinase activity or binding of  xxxd2985xxx  (as a type ii kinase
inhibitor) to f691l mutants in  xxxg801xxx . importantly, we observed that
the  xxxg801xxx  f691l mutant is not signiﬁcantly autophosphorylated when
transiently expressed in 293t cells without a co-occurring itd, and
hence is unactivated (supplemental figure 2), supporting the notion
that the effect of the f691l mutation on the activity of  xxxd2985xxx  is
primarily steric in nature.
the other class of  xxxd2985xxx -resistant mutations occurs on certain
amino acids located in the al of  xxxg801xxx , including  xxxd835xxx , y842, and
 xxxd839xxx .  xxxd835xxx  is located 4 residues c-terminal to the dfg motif in the
al of  xxxg801xxx . in both the crystal structure of auto-inhibited  xxxg801xxx  and
the model of  xxxg801xxx  bound with  xxxd2985xxx ,  xxxd835xxx  plays a critical role in
stabilizing the dfg-out inactive conformation of the al.  xxxd835xxx  forms

r834, i836, and p851. similar to y842,  xxxd839xxx  is located in the al
and is involved in a hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the
conformation of the al. as shown in figure 3f,  xxxd839xxx  is hydrogenbonded to the neighboring residue n841 of the al, which in turn
makes an additional hydrogen bond to n887 from an a helix in the
vicinity of the al. both y842 and  xxxd839xxx  therefore play a similar role
to  xxxd835xxx  in stabilizing the dfg-out inactive form of  xxxg801xxx . mutation of
y842 to c or h, or  xxxd839xxx  to g, would result in loss of these molecular
interactions, leading to the destabilization of the inactive form of  xxxg801xxx 
and reduced binding afﬁnity to  xxxd2985xxx . consistent with the idea that
these substitutions are activating, each mutation appears to exhibit
some level of autophosphorylation when transiently expressed in
293t cells in the absence of an itd (supplemental figure 2), and have
all been reported to occur de novo in aml patients.29,30 in contrast
to the solvent exposed  xxxd835xxx , y842 is mostly buried inside protein;
hence, the y842h mutation may preserve more molecular packing
interactions with its neighboring residues than y842c, resulting in less
destabilization of the inactive form of  xxxg801xxx  and a smaller effect on the
inhibitory activity of  xxxd2985xxx  (table 1).

bound to  xxxd2985xxx : gatekeeper residue f691 (cyan), i691 (brown), and l691 (green).
although f691 and i691 are compatible with  xxxd2985xxx  binding, l691 appears to be
more intruding into the inhibitor binding pocket. (b) space-filling model of f691i (gray)
 xxxg801xxx  bound with  xxxd2985xxx  (green). hydrogen atoms are shown in white. (c) spacefilling model of f691l  xxxg801xxx  bound with  xxxd2985xxx . the minor steric clash between
l691, particularly the hydrogen atom of the side chain, and  xxxd2985xxx  is highlighted
with a red circle. (d) model of  xxxd2985xxx  bound to  xxxg801xxx / xxxd835xxx .  xxxd835xxx  is located on the
al as shown in the purple segment.  xxxd835xxx  makes hydrogen bond interactions with the
side chain of s838 and main chain of m837, as represented by the black dashed line.
(e) model of  xxxd2985xxx  bound to  xxxg801xxx /y842. y842 is located in the al shown in purple.
it makes hydrogen bonds with the side chains of  xxxd811xxx  and r815. (f) model of
 xxxd2985xxx  bound to  xxxg801xxx / xxxd839xxx .  xxxd839xxx  forms part of the hydrogen bond network
involving  xxxd839xxx , n841, and n887, as represented by the black dashed lines. (g) al
amino-acid sequence alignment of  xxxg801xxx , kit, and pdgfr-a and -b, showing
homology of  xxxg801xxx / xxxd835xxx , kit/ xxxd816xxx , and pdgfr-a/ xxxd842xxx , -b/ xxxd850xxx .

bifurcated hydrogen bond interactions with the side chain of s838 and
the main chain of m837, both of which are located on the al cterminal to  xxxd835xxx  (figure 3d). mutation of  xxxd835xxx  to tyrosine, valine,
phenylalanine, or histidine would result in loss of the hydrogen bond
interactions, helping shift the equilibrium of  xxxg801xxx  toward an
activated state, which explains why mutations at this residue are
activating mutations.26 with respect to inhibitor binding, there are
no direct molecular interactions between residue  xxxd835xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx ;
however,  xxxd2985xxx  binding is predicted to be dependent on a dfgout conformation of the  xxxg801xxx  kd. the interactions of  xxxd835xxx  with its
neighboring residues located on the al in the native  xxxg801xxx  help
stabilize this dfg-out inactive conformation, whereas the d to v or d
to y/f/h mutations all destabilize this conformation through loss of
hydrogen bond capability, thereby decreasing the binding afﬁnity of
 xxxd2985xxx  to  xxxg801xxx . furthermore,  xxxd835xxx  is solvent exposed with
limited molecular packing interactions with other residues on the al.
this may explain why all  xxxd835xxx  mutations result in approximately the
same reduction in potency against  xxxd2985xxx  (table 1). interestingly,
the homologous  xxxd233xxx  residues in kit and pdgfr-a or b
(figure 3g) appear to play a similar role, as shown in the crystal
structures of kit and other similar biochemical assays.23 mutation at
this position often leads to activation of these kinases and reduced
binding afﬁnity to kinase inhibitors.27,28
y842 is also located in the al of  xxxg801xxx , 7 residues c-terminal to
 xxxd835xxx . in the model and crystal structure of auto-inhibited  xxxg801xxx , y842
makes bifurcated hydrogen bonds to  xxxd811xxx  and is hydrogen-bonded to
r815 (figure 3e). in addition, y842 also makes extensive hydrophobic
packing interactions with neighboring residues, including  xxxd839xxx ,

plasma isolated from  xxxd2985xxx -treated cml patients inhibits
signaling of  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691 mutants

to test whether clinically achieved plasma concentrations of
 xxxd2985xxx  are sufﬁcient to biochemically inhibit  xxxg801xxx  autophosphorylation and downstream signaling of a gatekeeper mutant, we
performed a plasma inhibitory assay using plasma obtained at steady
state from a cml patient treated with the clinically approved 45-mg
daily dose of  xxxd2985xxx . western blot demonstrates equivalent
inhibition of phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  in parental molm14 cells and in
 xxxd3069xxx -resistant molm14 cells harboring f691i or f691l mutations
upon exposure to  xxxd2985xxx -containing plasma (figure 4a-b), but
reduced inhibition in cells expressing the  xxxd2985xxx -resistant d835y
mutation. plasma from this patient was also able to inhibit downstream
phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx , a putative direct substrate of flt3itd,31 and ribosomal s6, a clinically relevant biomarker of  xxxg801xxx 
inhibition in patients (figure 4c).32
switch control inhibitor  xxxd3087xxx  is inactive against  xxxg801xxx 
al mutations

 xxxd3087xxx  is an investigational ﬁrst-in-class switch control inhibitor
of multiple kinases, including abl and  xxxg801xxx . the ability of dcc2036 to bind the transiently formed switch-control pocket of abl
allows it to retain activity against bcr-abl/t315i by avoiding direct
contact with the t315 residue.33  xxxd3087xxx  also demonstrates the
ability to bind both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated abl,
suggesting it may be able to overcome some of the resistance caused
by activating  xxxg801xxx  al mutations. to determine whether  xxxd3087xxx ,
with its unique mode of binding and demonstrated in vitro activity
against the bcr-abl/t315i mutation, would retain activity against
 xxxd3069xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx -resistant  xxxg801xxx  kd mutations, we assessed its
activity against our panel of drug-resistant  xxxg801xxx -itd kd mutations.
 xxxd3087xxx  was able to inhibit the proliferation of ba/f3 cells
containing the  xxxg801xxx  gatekeeper f691l and f691i mutations at ic50
concentrations (49 nm and 51 nm), only slightly higher than that
required to inhibit  xxxg801xxx -itd alone (19 nm), and retained activity
against select  xxxg801xxx  al mutations (d839g, y842c/h) at similar
drug concentrations. however, mutations at  xxxd835xxx  were highly
resistant to  xxxd3087xxx  (table 1). in general,  xxxd3087xxx  was the
least potent of all tested inhibitors against  xxxg801xxx -itd (table 1),
suggesting it may be less likely to be effective in aml patients at
clinically achievable doses.

discussion
recent clinical experience with  xxxd3069xxx  and sorafenib in flt3itd1 aml has demonstrated the ability of  xxxg801xxx  tkis to
achieve complete responses, even in the setting of chemotherapyresistant disease. unfortunately, relapses typically occur rapidly
and are commonly caused by the acquisition of drug-resistant
mutations in the kd that presumably negatively affect drug
binding. although it is anticipated that  xxxg801xxx -independent (“offtarget”) mechanisms will also confer acquired resistance to
clinically active  xxxg801xxx  tkis, experience to date strongly suggests
that potent next-generation  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors that retain activity against
 xxxd3069xxx  resistance–conferring mutants hold considerable therapeutic promise.
here we conﬁrm that the multikinase inhibitor  xxxd2985xxx ,
which is clinically active in cml and has demonstrated clinical
activity in  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml in limited phase i experience, retains

in vitro activity against the pan-resistant  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691i gatekeeper mutant, analogous to bcr-abl/t315i. moreover, we
demonstrate that  xxxd2985xxx  largely retains activity in vitro (at
clinically achievable drug concentrations) against the clinically
relevant  xxxg801xxx -itd/f691l mutant that was noted to evolve in 3 of 8
analyzed aml patients with acquired resistance to  xxxd3069xxx . notably, f691l was the most commonly detected  xxxg801xxx -itd mutation
recovered from an in vitro saturation mutagenesis screen using
ac2209 and has been implicated in in vitro resistance to other  xxxg801xxx 
inhibitors currently in clinical development.34 encouragingly, an in
vitro saturation mutagenesis screen of  xxxg801xxx -itd using a concentration of  xxxd2985xxx  (40 nm) identical to that used in a previously
reported screen for  xxxd2985xxx -resistant bcr-abl mutations,17 and
below that achieved clinically (cmax:145 nm, trough:64 nm) in
patients treated on a phase i study with the recommended phase ii
dose of 45 mg per day,19 identiﬁed only  xxxg801xxx  al substitutions as
a cause of  xxxd2985xxx  resistance, including two mutants with ic50s for
proliferation that lie within the range of clinically achievable
concentrations (d839g and y842h). the relative preservation of
activity of  xxxd2985xxx  against the f691l mutant warrants clinical
investigation of this agent in patients with tki-resistant aml who
harbor this substitution. however, only clinical and translational
studies of patients treated with  xxxd2985xxx  can deﬁnitively assess the
potential clinical activity of this agent in aml patients with f691l
mutations. notably, al substitutions at the  xxxd835xxx  residue in flt3itd, which are commonly associated with acquired clinical
resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  and sorafenib, confer a high degree of crossresistance to  xxxd2985xxx  in vitro and are thus predicted to represent an
important cause of clinical resistance to this agent and others,
including the switch-control inhibitor  xxxd3087xxx .  xxxd2985xxx  is
presumed to bind to  xxxg801xxx  in an inactive, dfg-out conformation
(“type ii inhibitor”), similar to the manner in which it is known to
bind to abl.17 it is predicted that a “type i” tki, capable of
binding to  xxxg801xxx  in an active, dfg-in conformation, will be
required to adequately inhibit the kinase activity of  xxxg801xxx -itd
 xxxd835xxx  mutants.
in light of its preclinical and early clinical promise and favorable
toxicity proﬁle,  xxxd2985xxx  may represent a useful second-line tki in
aml patients with acquired resistance to  xxxd3069xxx  or sorafenib as
a consequence of secondary kd mutation at f691, and thus warrants
more formal investigation in tki-pretreated as well as tki-naı̈ve
 xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml patients. further categorization of the spectrum of
resistance-conferring mutations to clinically active  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors
through translational studies promises to facilitate a more personalized
approach toward patients with  xxxg801xxx -itd1 aml treated with tkis.
although  xxxd2985xxx  appears to be active against all tki-resistant
bcr-abl mutants, it is clearly ineffective against multiple  xxxg801xxx  al
mutants in vitro, and a combination of potent  xxxg801xxx  tkis may
therefore be required to adequately suppress all resistance-conferring
mutants and substantially improve response duration. to that end,
 xxxd2985xxx  may represent a cornerstone upon which an effective  xxxg801xxx 
tki combination strategy can be built.
