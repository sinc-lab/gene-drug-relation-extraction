evidence that hypophagia induced by d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine in the rat is mediated by 5-ht2c receptors.  the present series of studies is the first to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms underlying d-fenfluramine- and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat using highly selective serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists. administration of d-fenfluramine, and its major metabolite d-norfenfluramine, suppresses food intake in animals. both compounds stimulate the release of serotonin and are potent inhibitors of the re-uptake of 5-ht into nerve terminals. in addition, d-norfenfluramine also acts as a direct 5-ht(2b/2c) receptor agonist. pre-treatment with the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb-242084 (0.3-3 mg/kg), dose-dependently inhibited both d-fenfluramine- (3 mg/kg) and d-norfenfluramine-induced (2 mg/kg) hypophagia. in contrast, the hypophagic effect of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine was unaffected by prior treatment with the highly selective  xxxg1114xxx  antagonists, sb-215505 (0.3-3 mg/kg) and rs-127445 (1-3 mg/kg) or the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists mdl 100,907 (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) and  xxxd2419xxx  (0.2, 0.5 mg/kg). in addition, the  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way-100635 (0.3, 1 mg/kg) and the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonists gr-127935 (1, 2 mg/kg) and sb-224289 (2-10 mg/kg) did not affect d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia. these data provide unequivocal evidence for an important role of the  xxxg1115xxx  in the mediation of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat and do not support the involvement of 5-ht1a/1b/2a/2b receptors.
