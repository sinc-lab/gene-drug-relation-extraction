article history:

previous evidence obtained from several behavioral and biochemical studies suggested the

existence of multiple cart receptors. however, identification of cart receptor binding has

accepted 14 march 2006

been largely unsuccessful until recently. the first evidence of cart signaling properties

published on line 19 may 2006

came from a study demonstrating that cart 55–102 inhibited voltage-dependent intracellular calcium signaling. more recent studies showed cart-induced dose- and time- xxxd2870xxx -

findings, the evidence of cart 61–102 specific binding was obtained from the same cell line.

this study demonstrated that [125i]-cart 61–102 was displaced only by active cart peptide
but not by inactive cart fragments or several other unrelated peptides or drugs. the [125i]cart 61–102 binding was saturable and it had a high affinity for a single site in att20 cells.
the binding was also dependent on time, ph, temperature and protein concentration. the
average (s.e.m.) bmax and kd values were 101.4  8.8 fmol/mg protein and 21.9  8.0 pm,
respectively. these data indicate the existence of specific cart receptor binding in att20
cells where cart signaling has been demonstrated. the identification of a receptor clone in
these cells may help us elucidate cart receptors in other tissues. because cart is
implicated with several physiological functions including feeding, drug reward and stress,
identification of a cart receptor would provide a novel target for the development of
pharmacological tools and drugs for obesity and other disorders.

previous work has demonstrated that a cart receptor exists.
injections of cart peptide into the ventricles of the brain
caused an increase in c-fos in many regions that contain
endogenous cart [12]. furthermore, there are perhaps a
hundred studies that show various behavioral and physiologic
effects of the peptide that are both region specific and specific
for cart 55–102, for example references [4,6]. it was also
shown that cart 55–102 inhibited voltage-dependent intracellular calcium signaling, likely via a g protein coupled
receptor (gpcr) using gi/o [14].

in addition, there is evidence that there may be multiple
cart receptors. the two active cart peptide fragments
(cart 55–102 and cart 62–102) show different relative
activities in different testing paradigms that, for example,
include food consumption [1,10], locomotor activity [7],
elevated plus maze activity, and hot plate antinociception,
acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition [1]. these
differences in potencies were not always of the same
magnitude or in the same direction. for example, bannon
et al. [1] found that in the acoustic startle response (asr), cart
62–102 did not affect asr at the same doses that cart 55–102

did, and in prepulse inhibition cart 55–102 was less potent
than 62–102. further, cart 55–102 was five-fold more potent
than 62–102 in inhibiting food intake. in addition to different
receptor molecules, this evidence also suggested that there
may be multiple signal transduction mechanisms activated by
cart peptides [9]. this brief review summarizes recent work
identifying a cart receptor in att20 cells.
the main criteria for identifying receptor binding with
radiolabeled ligands are well established [2,3,13]. it must be
saturable, proportional to tissue concentration and displaced
or blocked only by substances that bind to the receptor. for
many gpcrs, gtp or its analogs should reduce the affinity of
agonist binding. as expected, in the late 1990s, in the hope of
identifying the receptor, several labs obtained radiolabeled
cart and carried out binding experiments in brain tissue.
however, no successes were reported. several possibilities
may have contributed to the lack of identifiable receptor
including inactivation of cart due to radiolabeling, too few
cart receptors to be detected, very low affinity receptor to be
detected by binding, too high the nonspecific binding to
distinguish specific binding and, some unknown special
conditions necessary to demonstrate binding. these issues
have been unresolved situation over the past 9 years.
given the absence of reports of specific receptor binding,
and the possibility that cart peptide could bind to a known
receptor, we tested if cart 55–102 could block or alter the
binding of known ligands to known receptors, but we never
found blockade. the receptors we studied included a large
number of peptide receptors and other sites (table 1). also,
cart peptide did not affect da receptors or dat function (not
shown). these data suggest, or are at least compatible with the
view that the cart receptor is likely to be a unique and
hitherto unidentified site.
initial receptor binding studies proved unsuccessful in
several laboratories. our initial approach was to look for cart
signaling through known signaling pathways in cell lines.
recently, there was a suggestion that, in primary cell cultures
of hippocampus, cart 55–102 inhibited voltage-dependent
intracellular calcium signaling, likely via a g protein coupled
receptor using gi/o [14], however, we were unable to find
cart-induced calcium signaling in several cell lines. interestingly, because of cart’s ability to be neurotrophic, and
because of its involvement in addiction and neuroplasticity,
we then tested if cart could activate erk (increase the
phosphorylation of erk 1 and 2). cart increased levels of
phosphorylated erk 1 and 2 (p-erk) in att20 cells in a timedependent and dose-responsive manner (fig. 1). the activity
was blocked by a mek inhibitor and by pertussis toxin but not
by genistein suggesting the involvement of gi/o linked
signaling cascade. this response was not found in all cells
tested [8] and in fact was rather unique for att20 cells. these

findings suggested that a cart receptor exists in att20 cells,
and that it is a gpcr coupled to erk via mek utilizing gi/o
signaling [8]. this was an impetus to continue our efforts to
identify a cart receptor by binding in att20 cells.
we have since identified specific cart binding in att20
cells [11]. the reasons for this success in binding are several
folds and most likely include the use of: (1) a tissue source
(att20 cells) where robust cart receptor signaling through
phospho-erk was found [8], (2) intact cells which sometimes
produce better binding, (3) a relatively unique binding buffer
and (4) the discovery that [125i]-cart 61–102 is a somewhat
better binding ligand than [125i]-cart 55–102, and the finding
that inclusion of peptidase inhibitors tend to improve specific
binding. cart 61–102 was used instead of 62–102 because it is
easier to label, it is commercially available and there is no
evidence that it lacks potency.

value for cart 55–102 is the mean + s.e.m. with n = 3.
cart 1–27 and 30–52 are not evolutionarily conserved in
procart and have never shown activity in any assay; it is assumed
they are inactive. the specificity shown in this table satisfies
perhaps the most critical requirement for identifying the cart
receptor. these data were described in vicentic et al. [11].

a

interestingly, another group [5] has also reported cart
binding in dissociated hypothalamic cells and hepg2 cells but
the classical criteria of receptor binding were not all satisfied. in
our hand, in intact att20 cells, binding of [125i]-cart 61–102
peptide was specifically displaced only by active cart peptide
(table 2) [11]. the ratio of total to nonspecific binding was about
four-fold, which is a robust signal of specific binding. there was
proportionately increased binding with increased cell count but
there was no specific binding in cells exposed to boiling water
temperatures (not shown). the binding was saturable with an
apparent kd of 49.5 pm (fig. 2). moreover, of the many
compounds and peptides tested for blocking or inhibiting the
binding, only the active peptide cart 55–102 was effective. no
other substances, including the inactive cart peptides, 1–27
and 30–52, were active or capable of blocking specific binding.
because the receptor appears to be a gpcr that activates a gi/
o, we tested if a gtp analog could reduce agonist binding. cells
were incubated with [125i]-cart peptide. the following sub-

stances were added to a final concentration of 10 mm during the
incubation in separate samples: cart 55–102 to produce a
measure of ‘‘nonspecific’’ binding or a blank, cart 1–27, gaba,
gpp(nh)p (guanosine 50 -imido triphosphate trisodium salt) and
app(nh)p (adenosine 50 -imido triphosphate tetralithium salt
hydrate). a one way anova showed significant differences
among the treated groups (f(5,12) = 22.38, p < 0.0001). treatment
with cart 55–102 and gpp(nh)p produced results which were
each significantly different from controls (*p < 0.001). in addition, binding in the presence of gpp(nh)p was different from
app(nh)p (p < 0.01). these preliminary binding data strongly
support signaling data indicating that the receptor is a gpcr.
these preliminary data need to be extended to clarify if it is
a change in kd or bmax or both. it is predicted that it will be a
change in kd, which would be consistent with the presence of
a gpcr.
receptor binding is a powerful tool. for example, it can be
used as a screen for potential medications, as a measure of up
and down regulation in response to treatments, as a marker
for the distribution of receptors, and as a probe for
identifying cloned expressed receptors. the findings presented above suggest that the identification of a cart
receptor is eminent. a solid characterization of specific cart
receptor binding will provide a strong foundation for this
field. cloning of a receptor cdna will be an important next
step. while the identified binding is in att20 cells, a through
characterization of binding in these cells or the identification
of a receptor clone in these cells may help us identify
receptors in other tissues.
as noted above, there are likely to be multiple cart
receptors and many exciting discoveries in the near future.
