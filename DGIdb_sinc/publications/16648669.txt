abstract.  xxxg1078xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx ) signaling is regulated by changing its expression level.
two mechanisms are involved in this regulation. one is down-regulation through receptor
desensitization. receptor phosphorylation seemed crucial because stimulation of the mutant  xxxg1078xxx 
lacking five putative phosphorylation sites did not show down-regulation. the phosphorylation
level of the mutant receptor was much smaller than that of the wild type ones by several protein
kinases. the other is up-regulation through activation of receptor gene expression. protein
kinase c (pkc) signaling was suggested to be involved in this up-regulation. regulation of  xxxg1078xxx 
expression level was mediated not only through  xxxg1078xxx  but also autonomic nerve receptors.
stimulation of m3 muscarinic receptors (m3r) induced both down-regulation and up-regulation
of  xxxg1078xxx . down-regulation of m3r-mediated  xxxg1078xxx  seemed not to be mediated by pkc activation,
although pkc activation induced  xxxg1078xxx  phosphorylation. elevation of  xxxg1078xxx  expression was
induced by the stimulation of m3rs. pkc was suggested to be involved in this up-regulation.
stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors induced  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation through several mechanisms. one of them is enhanced receptor degradation after desensitization and another is
suppression of receptor synthesis that includes the suppression of receptor gene expression and
enhanced degradation of the receptor mrna.  xxxg1836xxx  was suggested to be involved in
enhanced degradation and the activation of the receptor gene expression. elevation of both  xxxg1078xxx 
expression and its mrna was observed in nasal mucosa of nasal hypersensitivity allergy model
rat after toluene diisocyanate provocation. these results suggest that activation of  xxxg1078xxx  gene
expression plays an important patho-physiological role in allergy. elevation of the mrna was
partially but significantly suppressed by antihistamines.

mechanism of  xxxg1078xxx  desensitization has been studied at
the molecular level (1 – 4) and classified into three
steps (5). down-regulation of h1rs, the final step of
desensitization, lasted for more than 24 h. this longterm mechanism is considered as depression of h1rmediated histamine functions. desensitization of h1rs
is induced not only by a homologous mechanism but
also a heterologous mechanism. heterologous desensitization of h1rs induced by the stimulation of muscarinic
receptors was reported. we observed the heterologous
down-regulation of h1rs through stimulation of m3

introduction
histamine h1 receptors (h1rs) mediate allergy in
peripheral tissues and histaminergic neurotransmission
in the central nervous system. repetitive stimulation of
h1rs was extensively investigated to induce receptor
desensitization by pharmacological studies in vivo. the

muscarinic receptors (m3rs). on the other hand, h1rs
are synthesized by the activation of  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression. the  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression lasts for more than 24 h,
and it is suggested to induce long-term activation of
 xxxg1078xxx -mediated functions. heterologous up-regulation
of h1rs was induced by the stimulation of m3rs.
m3rs mediate parasympathetic nervous functions in the
airway system, while sympathetic functions are exerted
through beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2rs). we are describing mechanisms regulating  xxxg1078xxx  expression level in this
mini-review.
methods
hela and u373 astrocytoma cells, naturally expressing human h1rs, were used. cho cells stably expressing recombinant human h1rs (cho- xxxg1078xxx  cells) or
recombinant human h1rs lacking five putative
phosphorylation sites (cho-5sitesh1r cells) were used
for  xxxg1078xxx -mediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation study. choh1r cells expressing recombinant m3 muscarinic
receptors (cho- xxxg1078xxx / m3r cells) or recombinant beta2adrenergic receptors (cho- xxxg1078xxx  / beta2r cells) were used
for study of  xxxg1078xxx  level and  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression
mediated by m3r and beta2r, respectively. radio-ligand
binding assay for h1rs, m3rs, and beta2rs were performed with [3h] xxxd3050xxx , [3h]qnb, and [3h]dha,
respectively. inositol phosphates were determined by
labeling cells with myo-[3h]inositol.  xxxg1078xxx  mrna was
determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr using
a geneamp 5700 sequence detection system (applied
biosystems, norwalk, ct, usa). the sequences of
the primers and probe were as follows: forward primer
for  xxxg1078xxx , 5'-cag agg atc aga tgt tag  xxxg889xxx  ata
gc-3'; reverse primer for  xxxg1078xxx , 5'-agc gga gcc tct
tcc aag taa-3'; and probe fam-ctt ctc tcg

aac gga ctc aga tac cac c-tamra.  xxxg1078xxx  gene
promoter assay was performed using  xxxg2041xxx -basic
(promega, madison, wi, usa) encoding the  xxxg1078xxx 
promoter region.
 xxxg1078xxx -mediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation
five putative phosphorylation sites were identified by
an in vitro phosphorylation assay. these sites included
thr-140, thr-142, ser-396, ser-398, and thr-478.
down-regulation of wild-type and mutant h1rs in
cho- xxxg1078xxx  cells and cho-5sitesh1r cells, respectively,
were examined. histamine-stimulation of cho- xxxg1078xxx 
cells induced down-regulation of h1rs, while that of in
cho-5sitesh1r cells abolished the down-regulation
(fig. 1). phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant h1rs
was examined using membranes from cho- xxxg1078xxx  cells
and cho-5sitesh1r cells, respectively. levels of
phosphorylation by protein kinase c (pkc), protein
kinase a, calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
ii, and protein kinase g were significantly lower in
cho-5sitesh1r cells compared with cho- xxxg1078xxx  cells.
m3r-mediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation
m3r-mediated down-regulation of h1rs was
checked using cho- xxxg1078xxx / m3r cells. stimulation by
carbachol of cho- xxxg1078xxx  / m3r cells induced downregulation of h1rs. stimulation by the combination of
carbachol and histamine induced more down-regulation
of h1rs compared with that of by carbachol or histamine alone. phosphorylation of h1rs were induced by
carbachol in cho- xxxg1078xxx  / m3r cells and it was completely suppressed in the presence of ro31-8220, an
inhibitor of pkc. however, ro31-8220 did not suppress
m3r-mediated down-regulation of h1rs.

 xxxg1078xxx  signal regulation

beta2r-mediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation
down-regulation of h1rs mediated by beta2rs was
examined using cho- xxxg1078xxx  / beta2r cells. stimulation by
 xxxd2098xxx  of cho- xxxg1078xxx  / beta2r cells induced downregulation of h1rs. the down-regulation was partially
inhibited by kt-5720, an inhibitor of  xxxg1836xxx .
 xxxg1078xxx -mediated  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression
stimulation of hela cells by histamine induced upregulation  xxxg1078xxx  mrna (fig. 2) and also h1rs. stability
analysis showed that histamine has no effect on it. the
promoter activity of the  xxxg1078xxx  was measured using
luciferase reporter gene and the stimulation was induced
by histamine (fig. 3). the up-regulation was completely
suppressed by ro31-8220. phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13acetate (pma), a pkc activating  xxxd2925xxx , induced
the elevation of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna.

activity of  xxxg1078xxx  gene promoter was decreased by
 xxxd2098xxx .  xxxd2098xxx  showed a negative effect on stability
of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna. the reduction of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna mediated
by beta2r was partially suppressed in the presence of
kt7220, an inhibitor of  xxxg1836xxx .
concluding remarks
histamine induced down-regulation of h1rs through
the receptor desensitization mechanism. the receptor
phosphorylation was suggested to play crucial roles in
the down-regulation because the mutant  xxxg1078xxx  lacking
putative phosphorylation sites abolished the downregulation and the phosphorylation of the mutant h1rs
by several protein kinases were also highly reduced
(6 – 8). histamine even induced up-regulation of h1rs

m3r-mediated  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression
u373 astrocytoma cells expressing recombinant
human m3rs (u373-m3 cells) were established.
stimulation of u373-m3 cells by carbachol induced
elevation of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna and also h1rs. the promoter
of the  xxxg1078xxx  was also activated by carbachol. carbachol
showed no effect on stability of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna. the upregulation was completely suppressed by ro31-8220.
beta2r-mediated suppression of  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression
u373 astrocytoma cells expressing recombinant
human beta2rs (u373-beta2 cells) were established. stimulation of u373-beta2 cells by  xxxd2098xxx  induced the
declination of  xxxg1078xxx  mrna expression. down-regulation
of h1rs was also followed by this treatment. the

fig. 4. regulation of  xxxg1078xxx  (h1) gene
expression.  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression was
increased by the stimulation of  xxxg1078xxx  itself and m3
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m3). in contrast, h1
receptor gene expression was decreased by the stimulation of beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2).

through the receptor gene expression mechanism
(fig. 4). pkc signaling was suggested to mediate the
up-regulation because pma induced the up-regulation
and was completely suppressed by ro31-8220.
in addition to the homologous down and up-regulations by histamine, heterologous regulation of  xxxg1078xxx 
expression was demonstrated (9 – 11). stimulation of
m3rs induced down-regulation of h1rs through the
receptor desensitization mechanism and up-regulation of
h1rs through the gene expression mechanism (fig. 4).
the mechanism of m3r-mediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation in which the receptor phosphorylation was not
involved seemed quite different from that of h1rmediated  xxxg1078xxx  down-regulation. however, the mechanism of  xxxg1078xxx  up-regulation by m3rs was similar to that
of by  xxxg1078xxx . up-regulation of h1rs was observed in
nasal mucosa of nasal hypersensitive allergic rats upon
allergy provocation with toluene diisocyanate (12). this
result indicated the dominance of  xxxg1078xxx  up-regulation.
 xxxg1078xxx  up-regulation in nasal mucosa was partially
(about 50%) mediated through h1rs. some unidentified
signals are also involved in this up-regulation. m3r
signaling may be a strong candidate.
autonomic nerves have been recognized to play
important roles in symptoms of allergic diseases. in
current therapeutics for allergic diseases, beta2r agonists
and m3r antagonists are used. m3rs and beta2r induced
up- and down-regulations of h1rs, respectively,
through an  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression mechanism. these
results strongly suggested that the  xxxg1078xxx  gene expression
mechanism is a target of therapeutics for allergic
diseases including beta2r agonists and m3r antagonists.
