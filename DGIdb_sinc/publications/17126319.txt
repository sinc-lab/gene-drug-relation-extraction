abstract
 xxxg81xxx  wild-type (+/+) and knockout (−/−) mice were used to elucidate the role of adenosine a1 receptors in caffeine selfadministration in a two-bottle choice test and in the effect of caffeine on total fluid intake and plasma renin concentration. with access to water
only,  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice showed greater basal fluid intake and greater plasma renin concentration than +/+ mice. free access to both
water and a caffeinated solution (30 mg/100 ml) for 14 days increased total fluid intake only in  xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice (by 23 ± 3%), and
both total fluid intake and plasma renin concentration were no longer different between genotypes. mean intake of water and caffeinated solution
was not different between  xxxg81xxx  +/+ and −/− mice. these data reveal that adenosine a1 receptors do not contribute to caffeine
consumption, but determine the effects of caffeine on fluid intake and plasma renin concentration.

1. introduction
caffeine (1,3, xxxd404xxx ) is assumed to be the most
widely consumed behaviorally active substance in humans. the
commonly recognized effects include diuresis, increased
locomotor activity, vigilance, alertness, and arousal as well as
sleep disturbance. furthermore, caffeine can increase blood
pressure, plasma catecholamine levels, renin release, and gastric
acid secretion. the actions of caffeine-induced by drinking low
to moderate amounts of coffee (1–5 cups or 60–300 mg caffeine,
inducing plasma concentrations of ∼ 10–50 mum) are mediated
by inhibition of adenosine a1 and/or a2a receptors (fredholm
et al., 1999). in comparison, concentrations of caffeine required
to block the breakdown of camp and cgmp by inhibiting
phosphodiesterases (∼1000 mum) are believed to be reached only
under most extreme dosages (fredholm et al., 1999).

recently el yacoubi et al. (2005) found evidence in a twobottle choice test that the  xxxg82xxx  plays an
important role in appetitive properties of caffeine: adenosine
 xxxg82xxx  knockout (−/−) mice drank significantly less
caffeinated solution compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. these findings indicated that adenosine a2a receptors are
necessary for the reinforcing effects of caffeine. this may be
relevant for the marked individual variability of caffeine consumption in humans, which could reflect polymorphisms in the
 xxxg82xxx  gene (alsene et al., 2003). however,
whether adenosine a1 receptors also contribute to caffeine
appetite and its reinforcing effects is not known.
with regard to fluid homeostasis and kidney function, rieg
et al. (2005) recently showed that  xxxg81xxx  −/−
mice lack the diuretic and natriuretic response to caffeine or
theophylline consistent with the concept that these methylxanthines induce diuretic and natriuretic responses by inhibition
of renal adenosine a1 receptors. along these lines, basal urinary
flow rate was reported to be modestly greater in mice lacking
adenosine a1 receptors compared with wild-type littermates

under awake conditions (brown et al., 2006) whereas clearance
experiments under anesthesia may have masked the modest
difference (rieg et al., 2005; vallon et al., 2004). finally,
adenosine a1 receptors mediate the tubuloglomerular feedback
(brown et al., 2001; sun et al., 2001; thomson et al., 2000) as
well as an inhibitory effect of adenosine on renin release (for
review see vallon et al., 2006).
the present experiments tested if adenosine a1 receptors are
involved in the control of caffeine consumption. to this end,
caffeine self-administration was studied in a two-bottle choice
test in  xxxg81xxx  +/+ and −/− mice. in addition,
effects of caffeine on total fluid intake and plasma renin concentration were assessed.

comparison, caffeine content in regular coffee is 25–120 mg/
100 ml). bottles were alternated daily for a total of 6 days. after
this conditioning procedure, the mice were given free access to
both bottles for a period of two weeks. the positions of the
bottles were switched daily to avoid position preference. consumption of water or caffeinated solution was determined daily
and the mean value determined for every mouse over the two
week period. body weights were measured under basal conditions and every second day during the experiment. plasma
renin concentration was measured according to kim et al.
(2006). blood was taken from the retrobulbar plexus (100 mul)
under isoflorane anesthesia into an edta containing tube at the
end of the two week experimental period. blood was taken
by the same approach in a separate set of male adenosine a1
receptor +/+ and −/− mice under basal conditions, i.e. with
access to water only. blood cells were separated from plasma by
centrifugation. renin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (gammacoat, diasorin, stillwater, mn, usa) as
the generation of  xxxg99xxx  after addition of excess renin
substrate from 24 h nephrectomized rats.

statistical changes or differences within or between groups, respectively. p b 0.05 has been considered statistically significant.

body weight was not significantly different between  xxxg81xxx  +/+ versus −/− mice (n = 12 each genotype)
under basal conditions (24.3 ± 1.2 versus 24.1 ± 1.2 g) and did
not changed significantly up to the end of the two-bottle choice
test (24.0 ± 1.0 versus 24.1 ± 0.9 g). under basal conditions water
intake was greater in  xxxg81xxx  −/− versus +/+ mice
(fig. 1a) consistent with a modestly greater urinary flow rate in
mice lacking adenosine a1 receptors (brown et al., 2006). the

2. material and methods
all animal experimentation was conducted in accordance
with the guide for care and use of laboratory animals
(national institutes of health, bethesda, md) and was approved
by the local institutional animal care and use committee. mice
were housed in a 12:12 h light–dark cycle in standard rodent
cages and free access to standard rodent chow (harlan teklad
7001).  xxxg81xxx  +/+ and −/− littermates were from
a subcolony of the original strain generated by sun et al. (2001)
that is kept at the va medical center san diego. mice have been
reproduced by heterozygous crossing, and the genetic background of the animals was a mix of 129sv/j and c57bl/6. with
access to one bottle containing tap water, basal water consumption was determined over two days. thereafter, a twobottle choice test was performed according to el yacoubi et al.
(2005). briefly, mice were given either tap water (short bottle
tip) or caffeinated solution (long bottle tip; 30 mg/100 ml
caffeine in tap water, sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa; for

two-bottle choice test induced a significant increase in total fluid
intake only in  xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice but not in  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice consistent with the absence of a
diuretic effect of caffeine in  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice
(rieg et al., 2005). as a consequence, total fluid intake was no
longer different between genotypes (fig. 1a and b). the mean
consumption of water and caffeinated solution was not significantly different between  xxxg81xxx  +/+ and −/−
mice (fig. 1a).
as shown in fig. 2, plasma renin concentration in adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  −/− mice was significantly greater under basal
conditions compared with their +/+ littermates. this is consistent with an inhibitory influence of  xxxg81xxx 
activation on renin secretion. notably, the two-bottle choice test
eliminated any significant differences in plasma renin concentration between  xxxg81xxx  −/− and +/+ mice.
4. discussion
the present study indicates that, in contrast to adenosine a2a
receptors (el yacoubi et al., 2005), adenosine a1 receptors are
not involved in the appetitive properties of caffeine as mice
lacking adenosine a1 receptors did not show any significant
differences in the intake of caffeinated solution in a two-bottle
choice test compared with their wild-type littermates.
with regard to fluid homeostasis, fluid intake was greater in
 xxxg81xxx  −/− mice under basal conditions and only
 xxxg81xxx  +/+ but not −/− mice increased total fluid
intake in response to caffeine. body weight was not different
between genotypes under basal conditions, and neither of the
genotypes exhibited significant changes in body weight over the
experimental period. this indicated that animals established
fluid balance, not retaining or loosing net fluid. the higher fluid
intake in the  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice under basal conditions is consistent with a higher urinary flow rate in awake
 xxxg81xxx  −/− versus +/+ mice (brown et al., 2006)
and consistent with a basal antidiuretic tone of adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  activation. the caffeine-induced increase of total
fluid intake only in  xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice is consistent
with the presence of caffeine-induced natriuresis and diuresis in
 xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice but absence in adenosine a1
receptor −/− mice, respectively (rieg et al., 2005). the latter
study supported the concept that caffeine-induced natriuresis and
diuresis are the consequences of blocking the basal antinatriuretic
and antidiuretic tone of renal  xxxg81xxx  activation.
plasma renin concentration, as published previously (brown
et al., 2001, 2006), was significantly higher in adenosine a1
receptor −/− mice compared to their +/+ littermates consistent
with a tonic inhibitory effect of adenosine on renin secretion via
this receptor (for review see vallon et al., 2006). presumably
because of linkage of the  xxxg81xxx  mutation to the
ren-1/ren-2 locus of the 129svj embryonic stem cells,
 xxxg81xxx  −/− mice have two renin genes whereas
 xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice have one renin gene (schweda
et al., 2003). a modulatory influence of the number of renin
genes on basal renin concentration can not absolutely be excluded, even though a recent study found no systematic dif-

ferences in plasma renin concentration and activity between
mouse strains having one or two renin genes (hansen et al.,
2004).
acute caffeine administration was shown to increase renin
release by an adenosine receptor dependent mechanism
(jackson, 1991). chronic application of caffeine, however, has
been reported to increase (tofovic et al., 1999) or not affect
plasma renin concentration (robertson et al., 1981). in our experiments the two-bottle choice test abolished the basal
significant difference in plasma renin concentration between
genotypes. whereas plasma renin concentration appeared
unaltered by caffeine in  xxxg81xxx  +/+ mice there
was a tendency for a decrease in  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice
(p = 0.069). a role for the number of renin genes appears
unlikely, but a possible explanation for the renin-lowering effect
observed only in  xxxg81xxx  −/− mice relates to the
fact that adenosine a2 receptors can increase renin secretion after
agonist activation (churchill and bidani, 1987). since caffeine is
an unselective adenosine receptor antagonist it seems possible
that in the absence of adenosine a1 receptors caffeine could
suppress renin release by blockade of adenosine a2 receptors.
along these lines, the higher plasma renin concentration in
 xxxg81xxx  −/− compared with +/+ mice under basal
conditions may reflect adenosine-induced tonic stimulation of
renin release via adenosine a2 receptors, which in the −/− mice
is no longer opposed by the inhibitory effects of adenosine a1
receptor activation. no data are available for the kidney, but it
was shown for the hippocampus that the expression of adenosine
a2a receptors is unaffected in  xxxg81xxx  −/− compared with +/+ mice (halldner et al., 2004).
in summary, caffeine craving and consumption are independent of adenosine a1 receptors. however, adenosine a1
receptors determine the effects of caffeine on fluid intake and
plasma renin concentration.
