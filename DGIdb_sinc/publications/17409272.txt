a decrease in the initial insulin secretion observed in an
early stage of type 2 diabetes induces postprandial hyperglycemia. a large-scale clinical trial has demonstrated that postprandial hyperglycemia is closely related to complications of
diabetes mellitus, particularly cardiovascular disorders affecting survival, and that the correction of postprandial hyperglycemia is important for the prevention of vascular
events (decode study group, 2001).
sulfonylureas, which are widely used for the treatment of
diabetes mellitus, are considered to bind to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
present in pancreatic ␤ cells and promote insulin secretion by
closing the  xxxg1253xxx  and opening the voltage-dependent
ca2⫹ channel (doyle and egan, 2003). however, sulfonylureas, as the long-acting insulin secretagogues, probably
this study has been approved by the animal use committee of the kawasaki medical school (03-093) and was conducted in compliance with the
animal use guidelines of the kawasaki medical school. this work is supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research 18591008 (to k.k.) and research project grant 18-501 (to k.k.).

although the latter half-component of insulin secretion profile
induced by 3 ␮m  xxxd2702xxx  or 30 nm  xxxd2654xxx  remained with
the existence of those agents. glinides enhanced insulin secretion even in ca2⫹-depleted medium, and its pattern of secretion
was same as the pattern with existence of verapamil. the latter
half was suppressed by 1 ␮m dantrolene, and concomitant
addition of verapamil and dantrolene completely suppressed
the entire pattern of insulin secretion enhanced by  xxxd2702xxx .
thus, we conclude that glinide action is demonstrated through
two pathways, dependently and independently, from the pathway through katp channels. we also demonstrated that the
latter pathway involves the intracellular calcium release from
endoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptor activation.

cause hypoglycemia and body weight gain and are insufficient to control postprandial hyperglycemia (shapiro et al.,
1989; uk prospective diabetes study group, 1998). furthermore, problems including secondary failure have been suggested previously (salas and caro, 2002).
rapid-onset and short-acting insulinotropic agents (glinides), typically  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx , are often used in
an early stage of diabetes mellitus, because they alleviate
postprandial hyperglycemia by quickly increasing insulin secretion after a meal and less frequently induce hypoglycemia
than sulfonylureas (sato et al., 1991). the insulin secretionstimulating action of glinides is considered to be derived from
a series of reactions triggered by their binding with  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx , similar to sulfonylurea (akiyoshi et al., 1995).
clinical effects of glinides, whose first site of action is
considered to be the same as that of sulfonylureas, have been
reported to appear significantly earlier and to disappear
more rapidly than those of sulfonylureas (hollander et al.,
2001). these differences cannot be explained by the drug
absorption rate (ikenoue et al., 1997) or binding characteristics with sur alone (proks et al., 2002; hu et al., 2003).

abstract
 xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx  (glinides) are characterized as rapidonset and short-acting insulinotropic agents. although both
compounds do not have a sulfonylurea structure, it has been
postulated that insulin secretion is preceded by their binding to
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  complex, and a mechanism of insulin secretion of
glinides has been accounted for by this pathway. however, we
hypothesized the involvement of additional mechanisms of insulin secretion enhanced by glinides, and we analyzed the
pattern of time course of insulin secretion from min6 cells with
the existence of agents that have specific pharmacologic actions. dose-dependent effects of  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,
 xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd2654xxx  were observed. insulin secretion
induced by 3 ␮m  xxxd3394xxx  and 1 nm  xxxd2215xxx  was
completely inhibited by 10 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx  and 3 ␮m verapamil,

min6 cell culture and insulin secretion analysis. min6
cells were kindly gifted from dr. junichi miyazaki at osaka university (miyazaki et al., 1990). the cells (passages 20 –30) were cultured
with modified dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (containing 15%
fetal bovine serum, 5 ␮l/l  xxxd26xxx , 50 u/ml penicillin, 50
␮g/ml streptomycin, 3.3 g/l nahco3, and 25 mm glucose) in tissue
culture flasks under humidified atmosphere at 37°c with 5% co2/
95% air. the culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh
medium every 24 h, and the cells were used for experiments at 80%
confluence.
for determination of insulin secretion, min6 cells were cultured
in a 35-mm-diameter dish with 2 ml of the medium for 72 h and then
preincubated for 30 min in 1 ml of 3 mm glucose krbh. the cells
were pretreated with  xxxd1868xxx , verapamil, dantrolene, and tetrodotoxin for 60 s before glucose stimulation. after the pretreatment, the
buffer was exchanged for a medium containing 10 mm glucose krbh
with or without agents. the buffer was quickly collected by aspiration every 30 s with the addition of the fresh buffer. after the buffer
collection, insulin left in the sample tube was confirmed to be below
the detection sensitivity of insulin measurement. the same protocol
was used for testing the effects of the sulfonylureas. a ca2⫹-free
krbh (135 mm nacl, 3.6 mm kcl, 2 mm nahco3, 0.5 mm
nah2po4, 0.5 mm mgcl2, 1.0 mm egta and 10 mm hepes, and
3.0 mm glucose; ph 7.4, 95% o2/5% co2 saturated) was used in the
experiments assessing the influence of the extracellular calcium. in
this experiment, the ca2⫹-free krbh was added 60 s before glucose
stimulation. insulin content was measured by mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.

measurement of [45ca2ⴙ] influx into the min6 cells. [45ca2⫹]
influx into the min6 cells were measured by the method previously
reported. min6 cells were preincubated for 30 min in 3 mm glucose
krbh buffer. following the incubation with 3 mm glucose ca2⫹-free
krbh buffer at 37°c for 10 min, the buffer was exchanged with
fresh and warm (37°c) 3 mm glucose ca2⫹-free krbh buffer. the
reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.7 mm [45ca2⫹]cl2 [3.7
mbq of [45ca2⫹]cl2 per dish], with or without 3 ␮m  xxxd2702xxx . the
cells were incubated at 37°c for 5 min. the rate of [45ca2⫹] uptake
into the min6 cells was measured at a 30-s interval as the following
procedure. the reaction was terminated by rapid aspiration of the
buffer containing [45ca2⫹]cl2 followed by five times wash of the cells
with ice-cold krbh buffer, and then the cells were scraped off with
0.5 n naoh. the procedure to stop the reaction was carried out
within 40 s. an aliquot of alkaline-digested cells was neutralized
with equimolar acetic acid and was subjected to measure the radioactivity accumulated in the cells with scintillation cocktail biofluor
(perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, boston, ma) by liquid
scintillation spectrometry. the content of protein in the alkalinedigested min6 cells was measured by the method of lowry using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard. the rate of calcium influx per
each period (30 s) was calculated by the following equation: [calcium
influx] ⫽ actual radioactivity/milligram protein ⫺ previous radioactivity/milligram protein.
immunohistochemical study of ryanodine receptor. immunohistochemical study was carried out according to the method
previously reported with a minor modification (katsura et al., 2004).
the cells were fixed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; ph
7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.3%
glutaraldehyde (4°c, 10 min) and then fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid dissolved in 0.1 m pbs (4°c, 30 min).
after washing five times with 15% sucrose containing 0.1 m pbs, the
cells were incubated with the same sucrose buffer (4°c, 2 days) and
0.3% triton x-100 containing 0.1 m pbs (4°c, 4 days). immunostaining was performed by using abc kit (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca), with first antibody, and anti- xxxg2001xxx , 2, and
3 antibodies (chemicon international, temecula, ca) were diluted
with 0.01% tween 20 containing pbs (1/200).

results
insulin secretion by sulfonylureas and glinides. we
had already reported the dose-dependent manner of  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  on insulin secretion from min6
cells (shigeto et al., 2006). dose-dependent effects of  xxxd2702xxx  and miglitinide on insulin secretion from min6 cells
were also confirmed in this study (fig. 1). the pattern of
insulin secretion induced by  xxxd2654xxx  was same as the
pattern with existence of  xxxd2702xxx , with the exception that
the concentration of  xxxd2654xxx  was only 1/100 of  xxxd2702xxx 
(fig. 2). our previous report demonstrated that tobutamideinduced insulin secretion was initiated between 60 and 90 s
after the addition of the drug with a peak at 120 s (shigeto et
al., 2006). on the other hand, insulin secretion induced by 3
␮m  xxxd2702xxx  appeared earlier with a steep peak at 60 s
and was observed until approximately 300 s. both 3 ␮m
 xxxd3394xxx -induced and 1 nm  xxxd2215xxx -induced insulin secretion from min6 cells were completely inhibited by

the presence of pathways dependent/not dependent on the
 xxxg1253xxx  has been clarified in the mechanism of glucosestimulated insulin secretion (gsis), and the results of electrophysiologic studies and studies of ca2⫹ influx suggest that
the first phase is dependent on the  xxxg1253xxx , whereas
the second phase, mediated by glucose metabolites, is not
(straub and sharp, 2002; rorsman and renstrom, 2003).
however, the first phase of gsis decreases but does not
disappear in  xxxg19xxx -defective patients,  xxxg19xxx -knockout mice,
and cells in culture (seghers et al., 2000; shiota et al., 2002;
shigeto et al., 2006) and is considered to be caused by a
complicated insulin secretion mechanism mediated by metabolism.
in this study, we noted the differences in the characteristics of insulin secretion-promoting actions between sulfonylureas and glinides and evaluated the mechanism of insulin
secretion at the cellular level using min6 cells, which have
the same insulin secretion mechanism as isolated pancreatic
␤ cells (miyazaki et al., 1990; ishihara et al., 1993). as a
result, we demonstrated the presence of a pathway mediated
by ca2⫹ release from endoplasmic reticulum, which is not
dependent on the  xxxg1253xxx , in the mechanism of glinideinduced insulin secretion.

the addition of 10 ␮m  xxxd1868xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  opener, or 3
␮m verapamil, an l-type voltage-dependent calcium channel
blocker. however, the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  and verapamil on
 xxxd2702xxx -induced insulin secretion were quite different
from the effects of those agents on sulfonylurea drug. the
earlier half-component of  xxxd2702xxx -induced insulin secretion was inhibited by the addition of  xxxd1868xxx  and verapamil, but the latter half-component still remained (fig. 2).
insulin secretion by glinides under ca2ⴙ-depleted
condition. effects of  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx  on insulin
secretion from min6 in the extracellular ca2⫹-free condition
were examined. both 3 ␮m  xxxd2702xxx  and 30 nm  xxxd2654xxx  stimulated insulin secretion with a peak at 150 s, even in
the medium condition with ca2⫹ depletion by 1 mm egta,
although the peak level was lower than the original one (fig.
3). interestingly, the pattern of insulin secretion in this condition was same as the pattern with the existence of 10 ␮m
 xxxd1868xxx  or 3 ␮m verapamil as shown in fig. 2.

effect of  xxxd2702xxx  on the intracellular ca2⫹ influx is shown

between 60 and 90 s after an onset of  xxxd2702xxx  stimulation.
the duration until the induction of intracellular ca2⫹ influx
by  xxxd2702xxx  coincided with the rapid peak of insulin secretion. we confirmed that 30 nm  xxxd2654xxx  also induced a

rapid influx of ca2⫹ ion into min6 cells as well as  xxxd2702xxx 
(data not shown).
ca2ⴙ handling at the level of endoplasmic reticulum and ryanodine receptor characterization. the
addition of 10 mm caffeine, which is known to be a ryanodine
receptor agonist, induced insulin secretion from min6 cells,
with a peak at 240 s after an onset of stimulation (fig. 5a).
the latter half of  xxxd2702xxx -induced insulin secretion was
completely blocked by 1 ␮m dantrolene, a nonspecific blocker
of calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum (fig. 5b). on
the other hand, an addition of 5 mm caffeine augmented the
latter half of insulin secretion, with a peak at 150 s (fig. 5c).
 xxxd2702xxx -stimulated insulin secretion was completely
blocked by concomitant addition of 1 ␮m dantrolene and 3
␮m verapamil (fig. 6). in the same condition, the effect of 30
nm  xxxd2654xxx  on insulin secretion was also completely inhibited (data not shown).
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that min6 cells
possessed ryanodine receptor types 1, 2, and 3 and also
demonstrated the existence of cells that did not recognize the
antibodies against ryanodine receptor types 1, 2, and 3 (fig.
7). to confirm the role of ryanodine receptors on insulin
secretion, we examined the effect of ryanodine on insulin
secretion from min6 cells. as shown in fig. 8a, ryanodine

discussion
there have been a number of reports suggesting that the
response of min6 cells to glucose and various drugs is nearly

identical to that of pancreatic islets (miyazaki et al., 1990;
ishihara et al., 1993; shigeto et al., 2006). therefore, the
results obtained in this study are considered to be important
for the clarification of in vitro responses.
whereas glinides have been considered to induce insulin
secretion by binding with sulfonylurea receptors, the present
study showed that insulin secretion induced by glinides appeared significantly earlier than that by sulfonylurea, sug-

with the addition of verapamil were obtained even without
the presence of extracellular ca2⫹, verapamil is considered to
sufficiently inhibit the influx of extracellular ca2⫹. therefore, the concentrations of inhibitors are considered to have
been appropriate, because they were sufficient to block their
target pathway and because no sign of toxicity was noted.
it is noteworthy that the optimal concentration of the
drugs used in this study for stimulation of insulin secretion
was lower than the concentrations used in many previous
studies. we determined the drug concentrations based on in
vitro results (shigeto et al., 2006) after confirming that the
drugs do not damage min6 cells at any of these concentrations. moreover, the optimal concentration obtained in this
study was close to the circulating drug concentrations at
clinical doses (ikenoue et al., 1997; doyle and egan, 2003). in
addition, the insulin secretion patterns of min6 cells under
stimulation with  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  were similar
to clinical changes in the blood insulin concentration (hu et
al., 2001). these observations suggest that the results obtained in this study reflect in vivo pharmacological actions
and are extremely useful for the analysis of action mechanisms of various drugs.
in sur-defective patients or  xxxg19xxx - and  xxxg1250xxx -knockout
mice, sulfonylureas failed to stimulate insulin secretion
(seghers et al., 2000; grimberg et al., 2001), indicating that
sulfonylureas act via a  xxxg1253xxx -dependent pathway
alone also in vivo. on the other hand, with glinides, the latter
half of insulin secretion (component 2), but not the early half
(component 1), persisted even in the absence of extracellular
ca2⫹, strongly suggesting the existence of katp channelindependent pathway.
an increase in the intracellular ca2⫹ concentration is generally considered necessary for insulin secretion from pan-

gesting different mechanisms of action between two insulin
secretagogues, including binding character to sulfonylurea
receptors. our study first demonstrated the presence of a
pathway other than the  xxxg1253xxx -dependent pathway in
the mechanism of induction of insulin secretion by glinides.
direct evidence of this finding is that neither  xxxd1868xxx  nor
verapamil, which are inhibitors of the katp channels and
voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels, completely inhibited glinide-induced insulin secretion. there may be an argument
that the suppression of glinide action was insufficient because of the low concentrations of these inhibitors, but this
possibility can be rejected for the following reasons. 1) the
inhibitors used in this study had been confirmed to completely inhibit the action of sulfonylureas at the same concentrations. 2) because responses similar to those observed

creatic ␤ cells (rorsman and renstrom, 2003), and we evaluated the possibility that component 2 was induced by an
increase in the intracellular ca2⫹ concentration due to ca2⫹
release from endoplasmic reticulum. as a result, component
2 was affected by the addition of dantrolene and caffeine;
thus, we concluded that component 2 is due to the ca2⫹
release from endoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors.
experimental results concerning the ca2⫹ influx also supported this conclusion. dantrolene suppressed gsis according to o’mara et al. (1995) but did not affect gsis according
to johnson et al. (2004). however, both reports were based on
an evaluation at high concentrations; whether they reflect
physiologic phenomena is questionable.
ryanodine was known to stimulate insulin secretion associated with an increase in intracellular ca2⫹ concentration
(johnson et al., 2004). we also confirmed that ryanodine
stimulated insulin secretion from min6 cells dose-dependently, and the effect of ryanodine was completely inhibited
by the addition of dantrolene but not by verapamil. dantrolene has been used as a ryanodine receptor blocker in
several organ tissues, such as skeletal muscle cells, cardiac
muscle cells, and nerve cells (brillantes et al., 1994; parness

types 1 and 2 has been demonstrated in pancreatic ␤ cells
(johnson et al., 2004), and we also confirmed the presence of
the receptor types 1, 2, and 3 in min6 cells. in this study, we
demonstrated that glinide-induced insulin secretion was
partly inhibited by dantrolene. thus, it is obvious that action
mechanism of glinides on insulin secretion from min6 cells
involves a pathway through the ryanodine receptors.
okamoto and takasawa (2002) demonstrated that ryanodine
receptors and cadp ribose play an important role in gsis
under physiological conditions; this finding is considered to
be useful for explaining gsis, in which glucose metabolites
are considered to be involved in a complicated manner. in our
evaluation, significant suppression also was observed, with
low-concentration dantrolene in agreement with this observation.
a decrease in the ryanodine receptor function has been
demonstrated in multiple diabetic animal models and patients with type 2 diabetes (islam, 2002; patti et al., 2003).
thus, glinides, which stimulate the ryanodine receptor function, may be considered to enhance insulin secretion by a
more physiologic mechanism than sulfonylureas.
