abstract—the vasodilators  xxxd2741xxx  (gtn) and pentaerythrityl tetranitrate (petn) are supposed to be degraded in vivo
to the lower nitrates petrin, pedn, pemn, 1,2-gdn, 1,3-gdn, 1-gmn, and 2-gmn. we synthesized these bioactive metabolites as reference compounds for pharmacokinetic studies. the use of hplc-methods for monitoring the stepwise reduction of
petn to lower nitrates and the syntheses of the glyceryl dinitrates proved advantageous. furthermore, we measured the vasorelaxant properties of all metabolites by performing organ bath experiments with porcine pulmonary arteries. in general, the vasodilator
potency increases with the number of nitrate moieties in the compound.

 xxxd2741xxx  (gtn), pentaerythrityl tetranitrate
(petn),  xxxd2402xxx  (isdn), and isosorbide5-mononitrate (5-ismn) are used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases. these compounds are supposed to
be enzymatically bioactivated in order to liberate nitric
oxide as the vasorelaxant factor. not only this bioactivation process but also chemical or enzymatic degradation in vivo may generate lower bioactive nitrates from
gtn, petn, and isdn.2,3
accordingly, the clinical proﬁles may result not only
from the initially administered oligonitrates; but also
and even predominantly4 from the action of the metabolites. many studies were carried out with petn and
gtn without looking at the bioactive metabolites.
the very limited availability of the metabolites for pharmacological and analytical purposes may be one of the
reasons for this restriction. we therefore synthesized
and characterized pharmacologically the potential bioactive metabolites of gtn and petn in order to estimate their possible contributions to the overall eﬀect
of the substances (fig. 1).

several strategies were applied to synthesize organic nitrates.5,6 we performed the synthesis of the petnmetabolites pentaerythrityl trinitrate (petrin) and pentaerythrityl dinitrate (pedn) similarly to hess12 by
reductively degrading petn with diﬀerent molar
amounts of hydrazine hydrate (2:1 for petrin, 8:1 for
pedn) in boiling mixtures of ethanol and dioxane
(scheme 1).

ganic nitrite, nitrogen,  xxxd2738xxx , ammonia, and the
corresponding alcohol.7 monitoring the reaction is
advantageous and was accomplished by hplcmethod a.
to prepare pedn, we used hplc-method a. we measured the degradation of petn to petrin, pedn, and
pemn (fig. 2; data from pemn not shown) and identiﬁed a suitable end point after 6.5 h (fig. 2).
petrin was obtained after 3 h with a 2-fold excess of
hydrazine hydrate. puriﬁcation was accomplished by
column chromatography.
reductive degradation was shown to be less advantageous for the preparation of pentaerythrityl mononitrate (pemn), 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (1,2-gdn), 1,3glyceryl dinitrate (1,3-gdn), and 1-glyceryl mononitrate (1-gmn). we preferred reacting the corresponding bromides with silver nitrate in acetonitrile
(schemes 2 and 3) and, if necessary, using a ‘fractionated extraction’ to remove byproducts. this procedure
resulted in purer compounds and higher yields than
did puriﬁcation by column chromatography. progress
of the reaction was monitored using the hplc-method
b for gdn.
a 4-step synthesis of 2-gmn was performed by acetylation of dihydroxy acetone, reduction of 1, and nitration

2-gmn was obtained initially together with 30% 1gmn. the isomerization of 2-gmn to 1-gmn under
basic conditions has been already described by capellos
et al.8 and was explained by a higher stability of the
ono2-group in position 1. less basic conditions and
shorter reaction times resulted in higher yields of
2-gmn (scheme 4). chemical protocols are given in

table 1 demonstrates that the vasodilator potencies of
petn, gtn, and their metabolites correlate with the
number of nitrate groups. but the decrease of potency
is more than a stoichiometric one and previous investigations have shown that not only the number of nitrate
groups; but also the ‘nitrate carriers’ structure signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the vasorelaxant activity.2 here too,
acetylation of the mononitrate 2-gmn to the mononitrate 3 enhances the vasodilator potency dramatically.
furthermore, quite signiﬁcant diﬀerences in vasodilator
potency were found between the isomeric 1,3-gdn and
1,2-gdn and between 1-gmn and 2-gmn, respectively. in general, a terminal location of the nitrate
group (1,3-gdn, 1-gmn vs 1,2-gdn, 2-gmn) increases the vasoactivity. we conclude that these diﬀerences in vasorelaxant potency are due to diﬀerent
aﬃnities and reactivities toward the nitrate bioactivating
enzymes. after all it should be mentioned that the
in vitro results given in table 1 are not simply transmittable to the in vivo situation due to very diﬀerent bioavailabilities of the compounds. for example, the clinical
dosages of petn have to be 80-fold higher than those
of gtn, although petn is superior to gtn in vitro
(table 1).3
