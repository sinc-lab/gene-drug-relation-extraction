using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique, we identified two time- and voltage-dependent k + currents: an emly outward
rectifier and a delayed outward rectifier in single vascular smooth muscle cells of rabbit aorta in culture. about 90% of the single
cells tested showed a predominant delayed outward k + current type. both k' currents were decreased by tetraethyeamonium.
in contrast,  xxxd326xxx  sulphate

decreased the early outward k + current, increased the delayed rectifier k + current type, and hyperpolmized the resting
membrane potential.  xxxd326xxx  was found to relax vascular smooth muscle. the vasodilatory effect of  xxxd326xxx  is
associated with the activation s f a k' current that is probably involved in keeping the membrane potential at the resting state,
thereby depressing the excitability of the aortic vascular smooth muscle.

materials and methods
voltage-clmp studies of the vascular smooth muscle (vsm)
are hampered by the smdl size of the vsm cells and the tough
connective tissue matrix of vsm tissue strips. moreover, the
temporal and spatid clamp inhomogeneity as well as the
accumulation and depletion of ions in restricted extracellular
spaces make it difficult to characterize the ionic currents in
isolated strips of vsm. however, voltage-clamp studies can
easily be carried out in single vsm cells cultured from rabbit
aorta. these cells do not normally fire action potentials in situ
but may be stimulated to do so in respnse to summated
excitatory junction potentials (sperelakis 1984). they can also
k coductance
be stimulated to do so in vitro by lowering the '
with tetraethylammonium (tea) or barium (ba2') (bkaily et
d. 1986; b r o o g m s et al. 1977; harder and sperelakis 1979;

culture technique
the thoracic aoms of young rabbits (1-2 weeks old) were removed
under sterile conditions and washed b e e times with sterile hmem
(hanks minimum essential medium, g i k o ) dissociation medium
containing 0.1% trypsin. the aortas were then transferred to a fresh
dissociation medium and incubated at 37째c for 28 min to facilitate the
removd of the adventitia. the stripped aortas were placed again in a
fresh dissociation medium (34째c) and were gently shaken for 15 f i n .
the suspension of single vsm cells was then collected by filtering the
suspension through sterile gauze. the filtrate containing the single cells
was centrifuged at 73g for 15 min. the single cells were then placed
in a plastic dish for 12 h (37째c) in a culture medium containing
hmem, 5% fehl bovine serum (gibco), and 50 iu/ml  xxxd2871xxx  (ayerst) to allow the fibroblasts to adhere to the plastic dish
(blonkl et d. 1971). after 12 h in culture? the suspension of vsm
cells was transferred to a new plastic culture dish, leaving the
fibroblasts attached to the previous culture dish, and was kept in a 5%
c 0 2 - 95% air incubator at 37째c until used for whole-cell voltageclamp recordings (2 days later). the single rabbit aortic cells showed
membrane invagination, were quiescent, and did not contract upon
electrical stimulation in a normal medium (bkaily et al. 1986). during
the 1st hour in culture, some of the vsm single cells appeared oblong
and others were round or ovoid. there occurred a gradual change in the
round vsm cell morphology from a round to an oblong spindle shape.
by the 2nd or 3rd day in culture, all single cells had become

spindle-shaped. the spindle-shaped single vsm cells were about
150-200 p.m long and 5-10 kna wide (toro et al. 1986). although we
were sure that all the cells in our culture were vsm cells, as a
precautionary measure, we chose only those that showed the characteristic membrane invaginations (spindle-shaped single cells).
whole-cell voltage clamp recordings
the patch pipettes were prepared by pulling capillary tubes (pyrex
glass, corning 7740) in two steps, with a vertical puller. the pipettes
were fire-polished, coated with sylgard, and filled with a solution
containing (in m o l / l ) : nacl, 20; kcl, 130; mgcl,, 2; egta, 5;
hepes buffer, 5; and glucose, 5 (ph 7.4). the pipette resistance
ranged from 3 to 4 gcl, and the seal resistances ranged from 10 to 20
gcl. the experiments were carried out at room temperature in a fresh
culture medium to reduce the hun down of k' currents. the use of a
culture medium in our experiments increased the stability of our
clamped currents. the superfusion contml medium consisted of
eagle's minimum essential medium with hank's base, supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum. the electrolyte content of the contra41
medium was determined by the ionic content of the hanks' solution (in
mm): na', 141.7; k', 6.2; ca2', 1.3; h4g2', 0.9; c1-, 145.8;
hco;, 4.2; so$-, 0.4; hbqz-, 0.34; h,pq;, 0.34; hebes, 5;
and glucose, 5.6. a patch-clamp amplifier (dagan 8906) was used for
the voltage-clamp experiments. the series resistance compensation
was adjusted nearly up to the point of ringing. the recorded currents
were displayed on a storage oscilloscope waveform analyzer (data
precision 6000) and recorded on an fm tape recorder (racal). the
cwents shown in this paper are representative of the total membrane
cwents. the seal of every single cell was checked during each
experiment. the experiments that showed an increase in the leak
current were discarded. the voltage steps for the i/v curve were
applied at 0.62 hz.

results
two types of k9 currents, an early outward k+ current and a
delayed outward rectifier (similar to the one reported in other
tissues) were observed in the aortic vsm single cells. figure 1
shows the control current recordings of the two types of ik(on
two various single vsm cells) at different voltage steps (fig. 1,
inset a and b), as well as the relationship between current and
voltage (i/v curve solid circles and solid squares). as illustrated by fig. 1, inset a (12 experiments), some single vsm
cells show a predominant early outward k9 current (about 5%
of the single cells tested). this early ik (type one ik) is
outwardly rectifying, increases upon depolwization steps, then
decreases slowly with a maintained depolarization, and reverses
at about - 80 mv. figure 1,inset b ( 15 experiments), illustrates
the results obtained from a single vsm cell that shows a
predominant delayed rectifier ik(found in about 98% of the
single cells tested) that increases slowly upon depolarization
until it reaches a steady-state level. the reversal potential of this
current measured from the tail current (holding potential of -'70
mv) was found to be between -65 and -55 mv (three
experiments, not shown). both types of k+ currents are greatly

greatly decreased by tea (fig. 2b). the effect of tea was

different extracellular concentrations of  xxxd326xxx  on k9induced contraction (maximum value of contraction) of arm

discussion
the cultured single aortic vascular smooth muscle cells of the
rabbit are spindle-shaped (after 2 days in culture), about
150-208 pm long and 5- 16 pm wide, and show membrane
invaginations. these single cells are suitable for whole-cell
voltage-clamp studies. in our experiments, the vsm single cells
showed an early time-dependent outward rectifier current (type
one ik) and a delayed outward a d inward rectifier timedependent k+ current (type two ik)that were sensitive to the #+
blocker compound, tea. the single cells were quiescent and
did not contract upon electrical stimulation. however, when k+
currents were blocked by tea, by cs+, by 13a2+, or by
 xxxd1804xxx  and in the presence of @s+ in the pipette
solution to completely block lk, a depolaizing voltage step
from a holding potential of -80 mv activated a slow inward
current that was sensitive to calcium antagonist h g s (bkaily et
d. 1988b).
as seen in results, the early outward k+ current of the single
vsm cells showed no inward rectification and the tail current
was absent or very small. this k+ current reversed at about - 80
mv, which indicates that this current is mainly carried by k+
ions. the apparent absence of type one ikin the i/ v curve of
figs. 1 and 3 is due to the large plotting scale that was used.
however, type two delayed rectifier k+ current showed an
inward and outward rectification between -65 and -55 mv
(from holding potential of -70 mv) and a relatively large
inward tail current. the amplitude of the type two ikand of its
inward tail current was decreased by tea. the fact that the
delayed rectifier time-dependent ik of the single vsm cells has
a relatively low reversal potential compared with the expected
reversal potential of a pure k+ current, suggests that this current
is not necessarily a pure ik.
the early outward current (type one) found in our preparation
showed some similarities with the current reported in other
tissues, such as h e m muscle (josephson et al. 1985), drosspa&ila flight muscle (sakoff and wyman h981), neurons (bader et
al. 11985), and smooth muscle (walsh and singer 1987;

klocher and isenberg 1985); this current was called i*. the
difference between the current in aortic vsm single cells and
the current reported in neurons (bader et al. 1985) lies in the fact
hat, in aortic single cells, both laand ik(and not only i*) are
decreased by tea. also, the ia-like current in aortic cells
seems to be different from those reported in smooth muscle of
the stomach (wdsh and singer 1987) and the urinary bladder
because our k+ currents were insensitive to ca2+ blockers in
normal tyrode9ssolution (renaud et al. 1988).
a delayed rectifier type two #+current was recently reported
in several types of smooth muscle cells including rat mesenteric
arteries (bean et al. 1986), rat vas deferens (ndcazawa et al.
1987), rat tail venous and arterial cells (toro et al. 1986), rabbit
intestine smooth muscle cells (ohya et al. 1987), urinary
bladder of guinea-pig (klockner and isenberg 1985), and
stomach (wdsh and singer 1987). these delayed rectifier k+
currents seem to be different from the one found in the aorta of
rabbit because ( i ) the outward-going rectification and k+
currents initiate differently; (ii) the delayed outward current in
the aorta is not sensitive to calcium blockers in normal solution;
and (iii) the type two ikin rabbit aorta shows inward and
outward rectification (renaud et al. 1988). the presence of two
types of k+ currents in the same single cell was reported by
sakoff and wymm (1981) and bader et al. (1985). both ik
types were completely blocked when the pipette solution
contained cs+, and when tea was added to the extracellular
medium.
beahmidine sulphate, a k+ blocking agent in cardiac cells
(bkaily et al. 1988a1, was used to study its effects on the k+
currents in cultured single vsm cells from rabbit aortas with the
whole-cell voltage-clamp technique.  xxxd326xxx  (lom4m) was
found to specificdly decrease type one ik(ia-like current) in
these cells and to activate a type two-like ik.the ikcomponent
activated by k h a n i d h e had a large i n w d tail current like the
type two ikcomponent found in the vsm cells superfused with
khanidine-free medium.

#+-induced contraction of rabbit aortic strips, although it did
not affect contraction induced by ne. also, our results show
that  xxxd326xxx  greatly increases a k+ current and hyperpolarkes the resting membrane potential in single vsm cells, and
this might partly explain why it relaxes vsm aortic strips.
therefore, these results suggest that the vasoconstriction of
aortic vsm cells could be due not only to a direct increase of
~ a ' +current but also to a decreased k+ conductance that allows
ca2+ current to predominate. in this case, one might expect that
an increase of k+ current by a drug such as  xxxd326xxx  may
hyperpolarize the membrane of vascular smooth muscle and
thus, may prevent ca2+ cumnt from being activated.
following completion of our experiments, other reports have
appeared (bray et al. 1987; southerton et al. 1987; weston and

'935

abbott 1987) which provided support for our finding that
vasodilatation could be associated with the opening of k+
channels by pinacidil, a cyanoguanidine derivative (weston and
abbott 1987). this  xxxg1232xxx  opener produced a
concentration-dependent reduction in mechanical responses to
) in portal vein and aorta of
noradrenaline and to k+ (5-20
rats. responses to higher concentration of k+ (40-$0 mha)
were little affected by pinacidil. binacidil hyperpolarized rat
aorta by 40 mv and this was due to an increase of rb-pemeable
k+ channels. in our experiments, we used 50 d [k], to
induce contraction in rabbit aorta, which would depolarize the
membrane potential by about 20 mv (sperelakis 1982). as
pinacidil,  xxxd326xxx  hyperpolarizes the membrane of the aorta
by 15.5 mv. this hyperpolarizing could be due to the increase
in the probability of the open state of a k+ channel with a single
channel conductance of 80 ps, which is involved in the keeping
of the membrane potential at the resting state (bkaily et al.
1988b).  xxxd326xxx  seems to be more specific than pinacidil
because ( i )  xxxd326xxx  relaxes only the high kf-induced
contraction in aortic muscle; (ii)  xxxd326xxx  does not increase a
k+ current in heart cells (bkaily et al. 1988a); (iii)  xxxd326xxx 
does not decrease action potentials in heart muscle (bkaily et al.
1988a). thus  xxxd326xxx  seems to activate a k+ current in
aortic muscle which does not seem to be activated in heart
muscle. the vasorelaxation of rabbit aorta by  xxxd326xxx  could
be due also to the shift of the i/v curve of the k+ current to a
more negative potential as shown in fig. 6. also, other
mechanisms could be involved in the relaxation induced by
 xxxd326xxx , such as the prevention of k+ channel inactivation.
the existence of such specific k+ channel openers signals a
significant new direction in the pharmacology of ion channels
which, to date, has almost exclusively involved channel
blocking agents (weston and abbott 1987).
to sum up, these observations demonstrate the presence of
two components of k+ currents in aortic vsm cells: (i) an early
outward k+ current (which resembles k+ current la); (ii) a
delayed outward and inward rectifier current similar to the one
"reported in other tissues" (ik). the  xxxd326xxx -activated ik
seems to be an important k+ current. this current, unlike types
one and two ik, does not show any rectification. we do not
h o w , for the time being, whether this current is different from
type two ikor not; however, it is possible that  xxxd326xxx  may
activate a silent k+ channel. therefore, the effect of bethamidine at a single channel level is currently studied in our
laboratory to better understand the relaxation produced by this
drug in aortic vascular smooth muscle.
