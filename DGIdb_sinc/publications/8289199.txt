a series of w-disubstituted alkenoic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized as antithrombotic
inhibitors of thromboxane az synthetase and thromboxane az receptor antagonists. hexenoic
acid derivatives with a 3-pyridyl group and a 4 4 2-benzenesulfonamidoethy1)phenylsubstituent
were found t o be optimal with regard to t h e dual mode of action. t h e most potent compound,
(e)-6-(4- (2- (((cchlorophenyl) sulfonyl) amino)ethyl)phenyl)-6- (3-p yr id yl)hex-5-enoic acid (36), inhibits thromboxane a2 synthetase in gel-filtered human platelets with an ics0 value of 4.5 f 0.5
nm (n = 4), whereas an inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase is seen only at a much higher concentration
(ic6240pm). radioligand-binding studies with [3h]sq 29,548in washed human platelets revealed
that 36 blocks t h e prostaglandin hdthromboxane a2 receptor with an ics0 of 19 f 5 n m (n = 5 )
and is therefore 85-fold more potent than another combined thromboxane az synthetase inhibitor/
receptor antagonist,  xxxd3115xxx (4). compound 36 inhibits the collagen-induced platelet aggregation
in human platelet-rich plasma and whole blood with an ecw of 1pm ( xxxd3115xxx : 16 p m ) and 100
nm, respectively, and was selected for further development.
the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels separates
platelets in the circulating blood from thrombogenic
structures in the vascular wall. in the case of the rupture
of an atheroscleroticplaque or other lesions of the vascular
wall, numerous external stimuli such as collagen,thrombin,
 xxxd80xxx  (adp), and serotonin bind to
specific receptors on the platelet membrane and trigger
platelet aggregation. this activation includes the instantaneous release of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) from the platelet
membrane, which is rapidly converted to thromboxane a2
(txaz)' (1) by two enzymes: cyclooxygenase catalyzes
the transformation of aa to prostaglandin hz (pghz) (21,
which is further converted to txaz by the action of
thromboxane az synthetase. both pghz and txaz easily
diffuse out of platelets and bind to specific pghdtxaz
receptors,2 thereby activating additional platelets in the
local environment of a vessel wall injury. this positive
feedback mechanism results in an almost explosive burst
of pghdtxaz, which are both potent platelet-aggregating
and vasoconstricting agents. due to the rapid degradation
of pghz and txaz, no systemic activation occurs.

12 (prostacyclin, pgiz) (3) via

pghz. pgiz, by increasing
intracellular camp, is the most potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation independent of the stimulus
and a strong vasodilatory agent. it has been demonstrated= that pgh2 released from activated platelets is
the major precursor of pgiz produced by adjacent endothelial and smooth muscle cells. this shift of pghz
from activated platelets to adjacent cells of the vascular
wall represents a highly effective local antithrombotic
feedback mechanism.

many studies provide evidencethat txaz plays a crucial
role in the pathogenesis of various circulatory and certain
renal disorders.7-9 acetylsalicylicacid (asa) was the first
antiplatelet drug to become available. by inhibiting
cyclooxygenase, asa suppresses the formation not only
of prothrombotic pghz and txa2 but also of the
antithrombotic agent pgiz, even at very low doses.lo
in order to overcome the lack of selectivity of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, thromboxane synthetase inhibitors
(txsi) and thromboxane receptor antagonists (txra)
have been developed by numerous research groups."
several clinical studies with txsis have demonstrated a
reduction of txa2 metabolites and a significant elevation
of pgi2 metabolites due to the shift of pghz. first clinical
results, however, have been disappointing. this lack of
efficacy was explained by the fact that the accumulated
pgh2 mimicked the prothrombotic effects of txa2.8
selective antagonists of the pghdtxaz receptor offer
another strategy for antithrombotic therapy. these drugs

impede the actions of both pgh2 and txa2 on platelet
and vessel wall receptors without an increase of the local
synthesis of antithrombotic prostaglandins.
in theory, the combination of a txsi and a txra should
overcome the limitations of the single approaches. recent
studies in animals4 and human volunteers12demonstrated
that the combination was more effective than either
compound alone with respect to the increased biosynthesis
of pgi2. several compounds have been reported which
combine both modes of action (txsi + txra) in one
molecule.13 one of these,  xxxd3115xxx  ( xxxd3115xxx ) (4) is
currently under clinical in~estigati0n.l~
a drawback of
 xxxd3115xxx  is its weak receptor antagonism (icm: 18 pm in
the presence of plasma proteins) compared to its potent
txsi activity (icml: 4 nm). we have therefore initiated
a research program to synthesize compounds which exert
both strong  xxxg2253xxx  blockade as well as synthetase
inhibition.

essential structural features of txsis, like  xxxd3115xxx  (41,
isbogrel (5), or ozagrel (61,are a basic nitrogen atom of
a 3-substituted pyridine or an-substituted imidazole ring
and a carboxylic group separated by a distance of 0.85-1
nm.le it was postulated that the pyridine or imidazole
moiety forms a complex via the nitrogen atom with the
heme group of the catalytic site of txa2 syntheta~e.'~
following isbogrel, we started with (e)-6-pyridylhex-5enoic acid derivatives as the txa2-synthetase-inhibiting
part of our compounds. if we assume a staggered
conformation for the carboxyalkyl chain of compound 36,
the distance between the carbon atom of the carboxylic
acid and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring is between
0.75 and 0.96 nm, dependent on the orientation of the
pyridine ring.

chemistry
the compounds described in tables 1-3 were prepared

as depicted in the corresponding schemes. the ketones
8-10 were synthesized by a friedel-crafta acylation of
the corresponding acetylated amines and  xxxd2715xxx 
chloride in a melt of dmf and aluminum trichloride. usual
friedel-crafts conditions gave only poor yields. the
ketones 8 and 9 were isolated as a mixture of the para,
meta, and ortho isomers. after removal of the protecting
group, the amines were reacted with su!fonicacid chlorides
to yield the isomeric pure sulfonamides lla,band 12-14
after recrystallization or column chromatography. they
were then olefinated under wittig conditions to give the
acids 32-34, 36, 37, 59-61, 65, 66, and 74. in all cases
except for the compounds 65, 66, and 74, the e- and
z-isomers could be separated by either column chromatography or recrystallization. the ratio of the diastereomers depended on the reaction temperature. low
temperatures favored the formation of the desired e-isomer. for compound 36,we have found a t -20 oc an eizration of 85:15 for the crude product which improved to
5000:l after two recrystallization steps. the configuration
a t the c-c double bond was confirmed by nmr spectroscopy. the butenoic acid derivative 59 was obtained
only in 12 % yield due to the fact that the corresponding
wittig reagent gave predominantly acrylic acid on base
treatment even a t -40 "c. by catalytic hydrogenation of
the double bond with palladium on charcoal, compounds
62-64were obtained in about 50% yield. in this reaction,
the consumption of hydrogen must be watched carefully
to avoid reduction of the p-chlorophenyl moiety.
for a more convenient syxthesis of the derivatives 3848,we prepared the intermediate 15 as a mixture of eizisomers by olefination of 8 followed by deprotection of the
amine and esterification by treatment with methanolic
hydrochloric acid a t room temperature. after sulfonylationlacylation of 15 and saponification of the esters, the
isomeric pure (e) acids could be isolated by column
chromatography.
the ylide for the preparation of the tetrazole derivative
74 (scheme 2) was synthesized by refluxing (4-cyanobutyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide with sodium azide in
dmf. the corresponding ketone for the synthesis of 31
could easily be obtained from 3-benzoylpyridine by
nitration, reduction,l8 and acetylation. wittig reaction
followed by deprotection and esterification with methanolic hydrochloric acid led to 16,which was further reacted
with p-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid chloride to give 31.
for the regioselective preparation of 35,we needed the
ketone 17 which was obtained by lithiation with butyllithium of the boc-protected 3-(2-aminoethyl)bromobenzene and reaction with nicotinic aldehyde followed by
oxidation with activated mnoz, according to scheme 2.
deprotection with hydrochloric acid and sulfonylation gave
18which was then transformed to35 by a wittig olefination
reaction.
the oxime ether derivative 68 was prepared by alkylation of the corresponding oxime 19 with ethyl 2-bromopropionate. the yield of this transformation was only

numerous non-prostanoid txras have a carboxylic acid

example of this class of txa2 antagonists. the correct
orientation of a 3-substituted pyridine ring, a benzenesulfonamide group, and a carboxylic acid in one molecule
should result in compounds with combined txa2 synthetase inhibition and receptor antagonism.

reaction of 1 la with hydroxylamine gave predominantly
the undesired z-isomer, but the e-isomer 19 could be
separated by column chromatographyin 10% yield. the
stereochemistry was confirmed by x-ray analysis.
the acid 58 was obtained by a wittig-horner-type
reaction starting from llb. 58 was further transformed
to 67 by reaction with ethyl glycinate in the presence of
n,"-carbonyldiimidaole and subsequent saponification
of the resulting ethyl ester.
oxidation of 36 with 1 equiv of mcpba at room
temperature yielded exclusively the n-oxide 30 without
epoxidation of the c-c double bond. the ester 69 was
obtained by reaction of 36 with methanolic hydrochloric

acid, whereas 70 was prepared by reaction of potassium
tert-butoxide with the corresponding acid chloride which
was formed in situ from 36 and oxalyl chloride. reaction
of 36 withammonia,methylamine, or dimethylamine inthe
presence of njv-carbonyldiimidaole gave the amides 7173.
the n-substituted derivatives 49-57 were prepared by
alkylation of 36 with the appropriate bromides or iodides
in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide or by michael
addition to ethyl acrylate in the case of 55.
the ketone 22 was obtained as depicted in scheme 3 by
acylation with  xxxd2715xxx  chloride in the absence
of aluminum trichloride due to the well-known tendency
of pyrroles to polymerize in the presence of lewis acids.

in vitro pharmacology
the compounds described above were initially tested
in the following three assays: (a) displacement of the highaffinity radiolabeled ligand i3h1sq29,548 from the pghd
txaz receptor on human gel-filtered platelets, (b) inhibition of txbz formation by human gel-filtered platelets
incubated with [14c] xxxd208xxx , and (c) inhibition
of collagen-induced platelet aggregation in human plateletrich plasma (prp).
the test results are listed as icw/ecw values in tables
1-3. txaz synthetase inhibition in intact platelets
demonstrates that the test compounds could penetrate
the cell membrane. starting from 6-phenyl-643-pyridyl)hex-5-enoic acid as the txa2-synthetase-inhibitingmoiety, we first examined in which way the benzenesulfonamide part must be added for potent txa2 antagonistic
activity. independent of the position of the 4-chlorobenzenesulfonamide group, all compounds 31-36 are potent
txsis, indicating that the txsi activity is not influenced
by the substitution pattern in the phenyl ring. as expected,
the oxidation of 36 to the n-oxide 30 is associated with a
reduction in txsi activity by a factor of 10 o00. the most
potent receptor antagonistic activity was found in compounds 35 and 36 which differ only in the regiochemistry
on the phenyl ring.
the large discrepancy between t h e affinities of 31 and
32 for the pghdtxa2 receptor and the ecw for the

inhibition of platelet aggregation is presumably a consequence of high protein binding in the aggregation assay
where plasma proteins are present. for the compound
32, the icw value of 0.27 pm increases to more than 100
pm if plasma proteins are added to the receptor binding
assay.
the importance of the e-configuration of the double
bond is demonstrated by isomers 36 and 37. receptor
antagonistic as well as synthetase inhibitory activities are
significantly reduced by the change from the e- to the
2-configuration.
after identification of compound 36 as a potent txra
and txsi, we investigated the importance of the sulfonamide element. replacement of the sulfonamide by a
carboxamide (36 39;38 40) is associated by a decrease
in both txra and txsi activities. this effect could be
explained by the different conformation of a sulfonamide
compared to that of a carboxamide.
substitution of the chlorine atom in the para position
by a fluorine atom (42) or a methyl (431, trifluoromethyl
(44), or methoxy (45) group has only a minor influence on
both activities. the introduction of additional lipophilic
substituents (46 and 47) results in a clearly reduced
inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, presumably due to increased protein binding.
replacement of the hydrogen atom of the sulfonamide
group by simple alkyl groups (49-51) does not affect the
txra and txsi activities very significantly. further
substituents of various sizes and functionalities at the
nitrogen atom (52-57) are relatively well tolerated, indicating a steric tolerance within this part of compound 36.
to get deeper insight into the structure-activity relationships of 36,we have varied the length of the carboxyalkyl chain. aa expected, the propenoic acid 58 and the
butenoic acid derivative 59 are weak txsis since the
maximal distances between the carboxylic acid group and

the pyridine nitrogen atom are only 0.62 and 0.73 nm,
respectively. it is remarkable that with the exception of
58, the butenoic, pentenoic, hexenoic, and heptenoic acid
derivatives 59,60,36, and 61 are all potent txras though
the length of the alkyl chain differs by three methylene
groups.
reduction of the double bond (62-64) is associated by
a decrease of txra activity, whereas the txsi activity is
reduced only in the case of 62 and 64. replacement of the
flexible alkyl chain by a more rigid benzene ring (65 and
66) weakens the txra activity in comparison to that in
36. the introduction of an amide function into the
carboxyalkyl chain (67) is deleterious for both txra and
txsi activities. assuming that the carboxyalkyl chain of
compound 36 mimicks the a-chain of txa2 (l),we could
understand that polar groups in this part of the molecule
are not well tolerated. replacement of the c-c double
bond by an oxime ether function (68) similar to  xxxd3115xxx 
is compatible with potent receptor antagonism but results
in a lbfold reduced synthetase inhibitory activity.
the methyl ester of compound 36 (69) is an unexpected
potent txra and txsi, presumably due to partial
hydrolysis to the corresponding acid 36 under the assay
conditions. this assumption is confirmed by the decreased
receptor affinity and synthetase inhibitory activity of the
more stable tert-butyl ester 70. the carboxylic acid could

be exchanged for a tetrazole group (74) without a loss of
txra potency but with a &fold decrease in txsi activity.
replacement of the benzene ring by a n-methylpyrrole
(75) does not impair txsi activity but receptor binding.
txaz receptor affinity could be slightly improved in
comparison to that of 36 by fixation of the p-chlorobenzenesulfonamide group in a more rigid tetralin (76) or
indane (77) ring system, whereas a more flexible system
represented by compound 78 results in a decrease of txa2
receptor affinity.
after we had filed a patent13v claiming compound 36
and the analogues, bhagwat et al,lhjn* published combined thromboxane a2 antagonists/synthete inhibitors
which are structurally similar to our compounds. they
have connected the three essential structural elements
(benzenesulfonamide, pyridine ring, and carboxylic acid)
by a branched alkyl chain. one of the most potent
compounds from this series, 20 (cgs-226521, blocks the
txaz receptor on gel-filtered platelets and the txa2
synthetase with an ics0 of 6 nm in our assays. in the
presence of plasma proteins, however, the antagonistic

induced platelet aggregation inhibition in human whole
blood and showed an icm of 90-130nm. this effect cannot
be explained by phosphodiesterase inhibition because the
icso is in the micromolar range (34 pm). similarly, a
decrease of the elevated 6-keto-pgf1, levels in whole blood
after collagen stimulation was seen starting only a t the
high concentration of 30 pm 36 which was interpreted as
the beginning of cyclooxygenase inhibition (see table 4).
this result is important since a functioning cyclooxygenase
is vital for the endoperoxide shift to occur; an inhibition
of this enzyme a t therapeutic concentrations would result
in the loss of the benefit of the combined mechanisms.
after oral administration (10 mg/kg) of 36 in rats, we

conclusion
we succeeded in the synthesis of combined txaz
receptor antagonists and synthetase inhibitors by integration of essential structural elements of pure txras
and txsis in one molecule. one of the most active
compounds, 36, binds to the pghdtxa2 receptor and
inhibits thetxa2 synthetase in the lower nanomolar range.
compound 36 is highly selective with respect to platelet
cyclooxygenase and phosphodiesterase inhibition. due
to ita potent antiaggregatory activity in human plateletrich plasma as well as in whole blood, 36 was selected for
further development,

frg), u 46,619 from sigma, and sepharose 2b from pharmacia.
collagen and skf dilution buffer were obtained from hormonchemie (munich, frg). all other chemicals were of the highest
purity commerciallyavailable. all experiments were performed
at least as duplicates.
thromboxane receptor antagonism. blood was obtained
from volunteers who had not taken any medication for at least
1 week by puncture of an antecubital vein and anticoagulated
with trisodium citrate (13 mm final concentration). plateletrich plasma (prp) was prepared by centrifugation at 170g for
10 min.
sepharose2b columns (175- x 23"
diameter)were prepared
in elution buffer (90 mm nacl, 14 mm trisodium citrate, 5 mm
glucose, and 50 mm tris, ph 7.4, 309 milliosmolar) and
conditioned by the passage of human citrated plasma. prp was
applied to the columns, and gel-filtered platelets (gfp) eluted
with the buffer.
the binding of the test compounds was determined by
measuring the displacement of the high-affinity ligand [8h]sq
29,548. a 100-pl portion of the test compound solution was
added to 750 p l of gfp or prp, respectively,followed by 50 pl
(7.4 kbq) of [wlsucrose and 100 pl of [shisq 29,648 to yield
0.5 nm as the final ligand concentration. nonspecific binding
was determined by adding u 46,619 (30 pm final concentration),
replacing the test compound.
after incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the samples
were centrifugedat 10 ooog for 20 8, the supematant was removed,
and 100pl was counted for 8hand w.the platelet pellet was

dissolved in 500 pl of 0.2 n naoh. a 450-plvalueof this solution
was mixed with 25 pl of 5 n hc1 and counted for sh and 1%.
after correctionfor spill over and extracellularspace in the pellet,
the concentration of the test compound causing 60% displacement was calculated.
thromboxane synthetase inhibition. blood was obtained
from volunteers who had not taken any medication for at least
1week by puncture of an antecubital vein, anticoagulated with
trisodium citrate (13 mm final concentration), and centrifuged
at 360g for 30 min. the thrombocyte layer on top of the
erythrocytes was collected and recentrifuged at 320g for 25 min
to sediment contaminating erythrocytes.
the enriched prp was applied to a 20- x 1.5-cm sepharose
2b column and eluted with acd (85 mm trisodium citrate, 65
mm  xxxd1710xxx , and 111 mm dextrose) containing 100 &ml
apyrase, 2 u/ml heparin, and 140nm pge'. the resulting gfp
suspension contained <0.1% of plasma proteins.
portions of 0.5 ml of gfp were incubated with 6 pg of [ w ] aa (specificactivity: 2 gbq/mmol) for 20 min at 37 "c, and the
reaction was terminated by the addition of 33 pl of 0.5 m citric
acid. the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate,
and the combined extracts were dried under nitrogen.
residues were taken up in 50 pl of ethyl acetate and applied
to tlc plates (merck, silica gel 60, 0.25 mm). after chromatography (chloroform/methanol/water/aceticacid 90:8:1:0.8, by
volume), the dried plates were covered with x-ray film (agfagevaert osray t4) for 3 days and the autoradiographs used for
localizationof the aa metabolites. the spots were scraped from
the plates, mixed with instagel (packard), and counted for 1%
activity. this procedure allowed the quantification of free aa,
12-hydroxyeicoaatetraenoicacid (12-hete), 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (hht), prostaglandins dz, e&, and fh, and
thromboxane b2 (txb2). thromboxane synthetase inhibition
is characterized by a decrease in txb2 and a corresponding
increase in the 'classical" prostaglandins. cyclooxygenase inhibition is seen by a decrease of endoperoxide-derivedproducts
and an increase in 12-hete.
phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibition. the enzyme used
was a crude preparation of the solublepde from human platelete,
10 ml of prp was centrifuged at 40 ooog for 10 min and the
platelet resuspended in 2 ml of distilled h20. after freezing
and thawing, the suspensionwas centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  ooog for 2 min
and the supernatants were pooled and stored at -80 "c. the
necessary dilution to produce a time-linear camp hydrolysis
under standard assay conditions was determined in a separate
experiment and was usually around 1:lo.
to determine the pde inhibition, 100 pl of pde mix (300
mm tris, 9 mm mgc12,90 mm amp, 3 mm camp,and 15pl
of [ah]camp/20 ml mix), 100pl of the test compound,and 100
p l of pde are incubated for 15 min at 37 "c. to stop the
hydrolysis, 250 pl of znso4 (0.266 m) and 250 pl of ba(0h)z
(0.226m) are added and, after reacting, the sample is centrifuged
 xxxd1891xxx  ooog for 2 min. supernatant (500 pl) is mixed with 4 ml
of instagel and counted. uninhibited control values are obtained
by adding water instead of the test compound, and background
values receive znso4 before the enzyme. the method is based
on the fact that nascent zn(0h)z and bas04 will adsorb amp
but not camp. thus, the activity remaining in the supernatant
represents unhydrolyzed [ah]camp which permits the calculation of the amount hydrolyzed.
human whole-blood platelet aggregation. blood (36ml)
was drawn from an antecubital vein and carefully mixed with 4
ml of trisodium citrate (13 mm final concentration); 2 mlaliquots were pipetted into polypropylene t u b s (60- x 14"
diameter) and incubated at 37 oc for 10 min while being stirred
with a teflon-coated bar (8- x 3-mm diameter) at 140 rpm.
collagen in skf buffer was added to give the desired final
concentrations; the control received solvent only. samples (10
pl) from the incubateswere pipetted immediately before collagen
and 1,2,3,5,10,20,and 30 min thereafter into 10p l of counting
solution (salinecontaining 1.8% formaldehyde). the remaining
single platelets were determined using an ultra-flo 100 (becton
dickinson) single-platelet counter. platelet numbers were expressed as the percent of the control sample count at time zero
and plotted against time. as a measure of platelet aggregation,
the area betweenthe time curvesof the control and the aggregated

38 journal of medicinal chemistry, 1994, vol. 37,no. 1

samples was determined. percent inhibition of aggregation was
calculated using the areas of the control samples.
prostacyclin formation. prostacyclin formation was determined by measuring the stable metabolite 6-keto- xxxg1734xxx . in
collagen-stimulated blood samples. the remainders of the
aggregation samples were centrifuged for 1 min  xxxd1891xxx  ooog,and
the supernatant plasma was removed and stored at -80 oc until
assayed. the assay was performed as described in the nen
brochure with the exception of using only half of the indicated
reagent volumes, which has been shown to yield accurate and
reliable results.
(c) pharmacology. collagen-induced aggregation in
platelet-rich plasma. blood was taken from healthy volunteers who had refrained from taking any medication for at least
14 days prior to the venipuncture. the blood was collected into
one-tenth of its volume of a trisodium citrate solution (130mmov
l). platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 150g
for 20 min.
the aggregation tests were performed in six channel aggregometers (built by feinmechanik and elektronik werkstatt, dr.
k. thomae gmbh, biberach, frg).
the photometric output was recorded on six channel recorders
(r-10,
rikadenki) at a paper speed of 50 mm/min. platelet-poor
plasma prepared from the blood of each volunteer (centrifugation
 xxxd1891xxx  o00g for 5 min) was used to preadjust the photometric
measurement to the minimal optical density.
platelet-rich plasma (300pl) and 3 pl of a solution of the test
compound or vehicle solution were pipetted into a cuvette and
stirred with a 3-mm long bar (diameter of 1 mm) with 1250
rotations/min for a 10-min preincubation at 37 “c in the
aggregometer;3 pl of a diluted collagen solution (prepared from
the 1mg/ml commercialbatch; hormon chemie, munich, frg)
was added to the stirred platelet-rich plasma to achieve a final
concentration of 0.5,1.0,or 1.5pglmlcollagen. after the addition
of the collagen, the optical density of the stirred platelet-rich
plasma was recorded for 10min. all experiments were performed
in duplicate.
the lowest concentration of collagen sufficient to induce a
reproducible aggregatory response in prp supplemented with
the vehicle was used for all following experiments with prp of
that donor to evaluate the inhibition of platelet aggregation.
the maximal change in the optical density of the prp due to
platelet aggregation was determined from each photometric
tracing. the difference in the collagen-induced optical density
change between vehicle- and compound-treated prp was divided
by the difference in the optical density between vehicle-treated
prp (before aggregation) and platelet-poor plasma to calculate
the relative inhibition of aggregation in percentages. the ecw,
le., the concentration of the test compound required for half the
maximal inhibition of collagen-inducedplatelet aggregation,was
calculated from the concentration versus relative inhibition of
aggregation curve.
