the pharmacologic profile of mirtazapine.  mirtazapine ( xxxd2651xxx ) is a new antidepressant with prominent alpha 2-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptor antagonistic properties and no effect on monoamine reuptake. mirtazapine increases noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission, as measured by on-line microdialysis and by enhancement of noradrenergic locus ceruleus and serotonergic raphe nucleus cell firing. mirtazapine has a low affinity for 5-ht1a receptors but shows 5-ht1a-agonistic-like effects in a conditioned taste aversion test and by causing lower lip retraction in rats. mirtazapine therefore causes enhancement of 5-ht1-mediated transmission. other studies show that both 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors are specifically blocked. the enhancement of both noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission probably underlies the therapeutic activity of mirtazapine. blockade of 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors possibly prevents side effects associated with nonselective 5-ht activation and may also contribute to the anxiolytic and sleep-improving properties of mirtazapine.
