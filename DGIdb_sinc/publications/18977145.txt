2-substituted derivatives of the antihistaminic agents bamipine,  xxxd1910xxx  and of their 1-phenyl
analogues were tested for their antimycobacterial and h1-antagonistic activities. they are strong h1receptor antagonists and also inhibit the growth of mycobacterials with a maximum mic of 6.25
lg/ml against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. h1-receptor antagonistic potency was slightly decreased
by substitution in ring position 2 and distinctly diminished by n-aryl substitution. the antimycobacterial
potency of  xxxd1910xxx  was in general increased by substitution in ring position 2, whereas only a
few bamipine derivatives showed markedly improved activity. a correlation between the two activities
was not detected for those compounds.

1. introduction
with more than 1.6 million deaths and 8.8 million new cases
being reported per year tuberculosis is the leading infectious cause
of death today.1 due to the spreading of multi-drug-resistant and
extensively drug-resistant strains, new antimycobacterial drugs
with alternative mechanism of action are urgently needed for the
therapy of tuberculosis.2 a number of compounds with h1-receptor antagonistic activity were far more active against mycobacterium tuberculosis than against other bacterials.3–5 since histamine
is a growth-promotor for mycobacterials and the growth inhibition
was blocked by the addition of histamine, the antimycobacterial
activity of antihistaminics has been argued to be linked to their
histamine-receptor antagonistic potency.4,5 we modiﬁed the structures of two of those antihistaminic compounds,  xxxd1910xxx 
(1) and bamipine (2), in ring positions 1 and 2 (fig. 1).
a great number of derivatives of  xxxd1910xxx  and bamipine
derivatives with different substitution on the ring nitrogen or at
the aromatic ring system have been reported, whereas substitution
of the piperidine ring was restricted to a few methyl analogues.
recently, we reported the synthesis of 2-alkyl and 2-aryl substituted derivatives of 1 and 2 and their 1-phenyl analogues which
have been prepared via new pathways.6–8 the  xxxd1910xxx 
derivatives were tested against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv.

compounds with alkyl substituents in ring position 2 showed higher activity.7
in the present paper, the synthesis of some new analogues of
bamipine will be described, which were prepared to complete the
series for the purpose of comparison. the antimycobacterial activities and the cytotoxic properties of all 2-substituted derivatives of
bamipine (2) were examined and compared to those of compounds
1 and 2 in order to elucidate structure–activity relationships. in
addition, the h1-antihistaminic activity of selected compounds
was tested and investigated for a possible correlation between
those activities.

2-alkyl and 2-aryl derivatives of 1 and 2 as well as the corresponding 1-phenyl analogues. in contrast to the formerly reported syntheses of  xxxd1910xxx  or bamipine derivatives our method is
based on the conversion of easily available 4-aminodihydropyridine-2(1h)-thiones to 2-substituted piperidines. the syntheses of
the  xxxd1910xxx  derivatives 3–7 and of the bamipine derivatives 8–10 have already been reported.6–8
the new 2,2-dimethyl analogues 11–13 of bamipine were obtained by means of slightly modiﬁed procedures. the corresponding
n-arylbenzylamines9 were fused with the 4-hydroxypyridine2(1h)-thione 14,10 giving the 4-aminodihydropyridine-2(1h)-thiones 15, 16 in good yields. their s-methyl derivatives 17, 18 were
further methylated yielding the 1-methylpyridinium salts 19, 20.
compounds 19, 20 were converted to the 4-anilino piperidines 21,
22 via hydrogenation with raney nickel w-211 at 45 psi. final nalkylation with benzyl chloride gave the bamipine derivatives 11,
12 (scheme 1).
the corresponding 1-phenyl analogue 13 was synthesized from
the 1-substituted 4-anilinodihydropyridine-2(1h)-thione 23,12
which was converted to its isomeric methoiodides cis-24 and
trans-24. those were hydrogenated giving the 4-anilino-1-phenylpiperidine 25, which was alkylated with benzyl chloride affording the 1-phenyl substituted analogue 13 of compound 11.
the discrimination between the isomeric compounds cis-24 and
trans-24 was accomplished via nmr experiments. in the 1h nmr
spectrum the resonance of the 5-h of cis-24 was shifted to lower
frequencies due to shielding of the phenyl ring. the assignment
was conﬁrmed by an noe from the 5-h of cis-24 to aromatic ortho
protons.
the structures of all new piperidine derivatives were established
by nmr spectroscopy as outlined in ref. 8 all of the new piperidine
derivatives gave noes between the axial protons in ring positions 3
and 5 as well as between 4 and 6. the preference for the chair
conformation of the piperidine rings was conﬁrmed by the characteristic coupling constants of the corresponding ring protons in the
1
h nmr spectra. the distinction between the 1h- and 13c-resonances of axial and equatorial methyl groups in ring position 2 of
the piperidine derivatives succeeded by means of noe experiments.
through-space interactions from the axial protons in ring positions
4 or 6 to protons of the axial 2-methyl groups were observed.
2.2. antimycobacterial and antihistaminic activity, cytotoxicity
the antimycobacterial activity and the cytotoxicity of bamipine
(2) and its derivatives 8–13 have been determined and are compared to those of the corresponding  xxxd1910xxx  analogues 1,
3–7 in table 1, which in addition contains the h1-antihistaminic
activity of selected compounds.
3. discussion
the antimycobacterial activities of  xxxd1910xxx  (1) and
bamipine (2) were only slightly changed by dimethylation in position 2 (compounds 4, 11 and 12). however, an additional equatorial
isopropyl substituent increased the activity remarkably, as was observed for compounds cis-3 and cis-8. in the 1-phenyl series the
inﬂuence of the substitution was not the same in both compared
series. the  xxxd1910xxx  derivatives cis-5 and cis-6 (36–39%
inhibition at 6.25 lg/ml) showed improved potency and trans-6
(75% inhibition at 6.25 lg/ml) had signiﬁcantly increased activity.
their corresponding analogues in the bamipine series cis-9, cis-10
and trans-10 were less or slightly more active than their parent
compound 2. however, compounds trans-9 (52% inhibition at
6.25 lg/ml) and 13 (91% inhibition at 6.25 lg/ml) were the most
active 1-phenyl derivatives of 2, whereas their  xxxd1910xxx 

10327

analogues trans-5 and 7 were among the least active compounds.
for the most active compound 13 a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 6.25 lg/ml against m. tuberculosis h37rv was determined (table 1).
with the exception of cis-8 all of the tested compounds were
less cytotoxic than bamipine (2). fortunately the cytotoxicity of
the most active compound 13 is comparable to that of  xxxd1910xxx  (1) which is still used in the therapy of rhinitis. however,
compared to the antimycobacterial drugs in use (inh, rifampicin)
the cytotoxicity of the prepared compounds needs further
improvement.
the h1-receptor antagonist potencies of compounds 1, 2, 4, 11
and 13 were examined.  xxxd1910xxx  (1) was slightly more
potent than bamipine (2). their 2,2-dimethyl derivatives 4 and 11
were still potent h1-receptor antagonists, but the dimethylation
in position 2 led to loss of activity of about 0.6 log units retaining
the  xxxd1910xxx  analogue 4 as the more effective compound.
both substances showed competitive antagonism at concentrations between 0.3  10 7 mol/l and 1  10 6 mol/l shifting the
dosage–response curve parallel to the right. at concentrations
between 0.3 and 1  10 5 mol/l the dosage–response curves were
depressed indicating non-competitive antagonism. only slight
activity ( log kb = 5) was detectable for the 1-phenyl compound
13 at 0.3  10 4 mol/l (table 1). for compounds 1, 2, 4, 11 and
13 molecular modeling studies were undertaken in order to investigate the reasons for the decreased h1-receptor antagonist
potency of the prepared 2-substituted and especially the 1-phenyl
analogues of compounds 1 and 2. neutral molecules as well as protonated and diprotonated dications were considered. the conformer populations were not affected by dimethylation at c-2.
the loss of activity of about 0.6 log units (1 vs 4, 2 vs 11) can be
attributed to steric hindrance and to the changes in the molecular
electrostatic and lipophilic potential. thus, the drop in h1-receptor
antagonist potency in 4 and 11 can be attributed to a ‘‘shielding”
effect of the 2,2-dimethyl moiety of the positive charge at the protonated n-1 center. the very low h1-antihistaminic activity (loss of
>3 log units) of the 1-phenyl compound 13 can be explained by a
combination of increased ‘‘shielding” of n-1 and diminished basicity (for computational details see supplementary material).
in both series a 1-phenyl derivative was the most active antimycobacterial agent. since those compounds possess negligible
h1-antihistaminic activity the presumed linkage between h1-antihistaminic and antimycobacterial activity has not been conﬁrmed.
4. conclusion
the h1-receptor antagonistic activities of  xxxd1910xxx  and
bamipine were slightly decreased by substitution in ring position
2 and nearly lost by replacement of the 1-methyl by a 1-phenyl
group. in contrast the antimycobacterial activity was nearly always
increased by this derivatization. the supposed correlation of antimycobacterial and h1-receptor antagonistic activity of piperidine
derivatives was not observed for the tested analogues of  xxxd1910xxx  and bamipine. moreover, the compound with the highest
activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv (mic: 6.25 lg/
ml) exhibits neglectable h1-antihistaminic activity indicating an
alternative mechanism of action.

5.3. biological tests
5.3.1. antimycobacterial activity
the primary screening of the antimycobacterial activity of all
synthesized analogues of  xxxd1910xxx  and bamipine was conducted in vitro at a concentration of 6.25 lg/ml against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv (atcc 27294) in bactec 12b medium
using a broth microdilution assay, the microplate alamar blue assay (maba).13 isoniazid (inh) was used as standard. compounds
effecting >90% inhibition were retested at lower concentrations
to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration. the mic is
deﬁned as the lowest concentration effecting a reduction in ﬂuorescence of 90% relative to controls.
5.3.2. cytotoxicity
the cytotoxic properties of all bamipine analogues were detected indirectly via cell proliferation of a hek-293 cell line (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) using a colorimetric assay
based on the reduction of mtt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to a colored formazan product by
proliferating cells.14 inh was used as standard. the data for the
 xxxd1910xxx  derivatives were taken from ref. 7 which contains
a detailed description of the test method.
5.3.3. antihistaminic activity
the h1-receptor antagonist potency of selected compounds was
determined in whole segments of the guinea-pig ileum as previously described.15
acknowledgments
