background:  xxxd216xxx  is a single-isomer (r,r- xxxd2155xxx ) nebulized long-acting b2-agonist
approved for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). exposure (plasma
concentrations of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) were compared for 15 mg
nebulized  xxxd216xxx  and 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  (containing 6 and 12 mg (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ,
respectively) delivered by dry powder inhaler (dpi).
methods: an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 39 subjects with copd (fev1 1.4 l,
44.4% predicted). twice-daily treatments included nebulized  xxxd216xxx  (15 mg) and racemic
 xxxd2155xxx  dpi (12 and 24 mg) for 14 days. plasma concentrations of (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  were
determined on days 1 and 14 of each treatment period. airway function efﬁcacy endpoints included the
percent change in trough fev1 from baseline on day 14 of each treatment period.
results: at steady state, exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  was similar following nebulized 15 mg
 xxxd216xxx  (cmax: 6.5 pg/ml; auc(0t): 56.5 pg h/ml) and 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi
(cmax: 6.2 pg/ml; auc(0t): 46.3 pg h/ml). the geometric mean ratios between these two treatments
(90% conﬁdence intervals) for cmax and auc(0t) were 0.91 (0.76, 1.09) and 1.16 (1.00, 1.35), respectively.
treatment with 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi resulted in dose proportionally higher (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx :
cmax (10.8 pg/ml) and auc(0t) (83.6 pg h/ml). detectable (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was consistently measured
only after treatment with racemic  xxxd2155xxx . the mean percent increase in trough fev1 was 19.1% in
the  xxxd216xxx  group, and 16.0% and 18.2% in the 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  groups,
respectively. changes in (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  concentrations over time paralleled changes in fev1.
conclusions: in this study, plasma exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  was similar for nebulized 15 mg
 xxxd216xxx  and 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi, and 40% lower than 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi. there
was no evidence of chiral interconversion following treatment with  xxxd216xxx . finally, temporal
changes in airway function in all treatment groups corresponded to changes in (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  plasma
concentrations.

1. introduction
many drugs exist as asymmetric (chiral) molecules composed of
non-superimposable mirror images or enantiomers. there are often
pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic differences between
enantiomers, which may affect the safety and efﬁcacy of racemic
drugs [1–3]. racemic  xxxd2155xxx  contains two chiral centers, and

consists of an equal mixture of (r,r)- and (s,s)-enantiomers. the
(r,r)-isomer of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  is a potent long-acting beta2agonist that provides the therapeutic bronchodilation characteristics of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  [4]. in preclinical studies measuring
inhibition of tracheal smooth muscle contraction, (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
had two-fold greater potency compared with racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
and was approximately 100- to 200-fold more potent than the
b-agonist albuterol [4]. in contrast, receptor stimulation smooth
muscle relaxation, and inhibition of spasmogen response studies
[5,6] have found that the (s,s)-isomer of  xxxd2155xxx  was a 1000fold less potent b-agonist than the (r,r)-isomer.

both nebulized  xxxd216xxx  (15 mg), the (r,r)-isomer of
 xxxd2155xxx , and racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi (12 mg) are approved in
the united states for use in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (copd). however, these drugs not only differ
with respect to their route of administration, each contain
different amounts of the (r,r)-isomer (15 mg vs. 6 mg, respectively).
in an in vitro drug delivery study, nebulization of a 2-ml unit dose
of  xxxd216xxx  containing 15 mg of drug (the ‘‘nominal’’ dose)
produced a delivered amount of 4.1 mg of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx , or 27%
of the nominal dose [7]. in comparison, the emitted amount of
12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  is reported to be 10 mg [8]. this amount
is equivalent to 8.2 mg of the free base of racemic  xxxd2155xxx , or
4.1 mg of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx . while these results suggest that
nebulized 15 mg/2 ml  xxxd216xxx  and 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
dpi emit similar amounts of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx , the differences in
the dosage forms and testing methods make it difﬁcult to predict
the dose delivered to the lung in patients and the relative in vivo
exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  between 15 mg  xxxd216xxx  and
12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx .
the current study compared the systemic exposure to (r,r)and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  after administration of nebulized  xxxd216xxx  (15 mg) and two doses of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi (12 and
24 mg, containing 6 and 12 mg of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx , respectively) in
subjects with moderate to severe copd. this is the ﬁrst chiralspeciﬁc plasma concentration data obtained after inhaled dosing,
which was made feasible by the development of a sensitive
analytical method for the detection of  xxxd2155xxx  enantiomers [9].
airway function changes with treatment were also determined.

2. materials and methods
the trial was conducted according to food and drug administration (fda) regulations and guidelines, which encompass the
principles established by the declaration of helsinki [10]. the
institutional review boards at each of the eight study sites
approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
2.1. subjects
subjects had non-asthmatic copd (including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). subjects were 35 years of age and
older, had a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) p65%
of predicted (11) but at least 0.70 l, a fev1/forced vital capacity
ratio o70%, x15 pack-year smoking history, and breathlessness
severity from the modiﬁed medical research council dyspnea
scale [11] of x2 (i.e., shortness of breath when hurrying on the
level or walking up a slight hill). subjects with a febrile illness
within 72 h of screening; eosinophil count 45% of total white
blood cell count; a history of adult asthma; or chest x-ray within 6
months suggesting a respiratory diagnosis other than copd were
excluded.
2.2. study design
this was a phase ii, open-label, randomized, multicenter,
multiple-dose, three-way crossover study. the following treatments were administered twice daily (bid) for 13 consecutive
days, and a single dose was given on the morning of the 14th day:
 xxxd2155xxx  fumarate 12 mg (dry powder inhaler (dpi); foradils
aerolizers, schering-plough corporation, kenilworth, nj, usa),
 xxxd2155xxx  fumarate 24 mg dpi (two 12-mg foradils capsules per
dose, schering-plough corporation, kenilworth, nj, usa), and
nebulized  xxxd216xxx  tartrate 15 mg (brovanatm inhalation

solution, sepracor inc., marlborough, ma, usa). subjects were
randomly allocated to one of the six treatment sequences (10-day
washout between treatments).
for each treatment sequence, subjects were admitted to the
clinic the evening before dosing on day 1. blood samples were
collected in the morning prior to the ﬁrst dose, and at 15, 30,
45 min, and 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after dosing. additional blood samples
for steady-state determination were obtained on days 12 and 13
(264 and 288 h after initial dosing, respectively). subjects were
readmitted on day 13, where clinic personnel administered the
evening dose of study medication. in the morning on day 14, blood
samples were collected prior to the last dose, and at 15, 30,
45 min, and 1, 2, 6, 12, 16, and 24 h after dosing. subjects returned
to the clinic to provide additional blood samples at 48, 72, and
96 h post-last dose. while in the clinic, subjects were fasted for at
least 8 h prior to the morning dose, and for 4 h after dosing. (r,r) xxxd2155xxx  and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  levels were measured using a
validated chiral analytical method (see supplemental material).
the lower limit of quantiﬁcation (lloq) was 0.5 pg/ml for both
analytes. this bioanalytical method was validated in accordance
with food and drug administration (usfda) guidance [12].
serial spirometry was performed in triplicate in accordance
with american association for respiratory care clinical practice
guidelines [13] at screening and during each treatment sequence.
testing was conducted immediately before dosing on day 1, and at
15 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h after dosing. final spirometry
testing occurred 11 and 12 h after the evening dose on day 13, and
after dosing on day 14 at 15 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h.
fasting clinical laboratory panels (chemistry [including glucose
and potassium], hematology, and urinalysis) were obtained before
dosing on day 1 of each treatment sequence, and at the end of the
trial. serum glucose and potassium concentrations were also
determined 2 and 6 h after the ﬁrst dose on day 1. vital signs and
12-lead electrocardiograms (ecgs) were obtained prior to dosing
on days 1 and 14, and 2 h after dosing on day 1.

2.3. study endpoints
the primary endpoint was exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
determined from the pk parameters auc(0t) and cmax. additional
pk parameters included tmax, t1/2, tlast, auc(0n), and accumulation ratios (assessed by rcmax and rauc(0t)). the same pk
parameters were also determined for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx .
airway function efﬁcacy endpoints assessed the percent
change in trough fev1 from baseline after the ﬁrst dose on day
1 and prior to the last dose on day 14. baseline was deﬁned as the
fev1 value obtained prior to the ﬁrst dose on day 1. trough was
deﬁned as the fev1 value obtained 12 h post-ﬁrst dose on day 1,
and the fev1 value obtained prior to last dose on day 14 (i.e., 12 h
after the evening dose on day 13). other efﬁcacy endpoints
included the: percent change in fev1 auc(0–12 h) from predose,
peak percent change in fev1 from baseline, peak percent change
in fev1 from predose, and peak percent predicted fev1.
safety assessments included the evaluation of adverse events,
vital signs, physical examination ﬁndings, ecgs, and clinical
laboratory panels.

2.4. statistical methods
the study was designed as a descriptive comparison with an
active control and hence there was no power calculation. the
number of patients was similar to that used in previous comparable studies [14,15]. efﬁcacy and safety analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (itt) population and included all

article in press

subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. all itt
subjects had pk data and were included in the pk analyses.
pk parameters for (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  were determined
by non-compartmental methods, using winnonlins professional
5.1.1 (pharsight, mountainview, ca), based upon the individual
plasma concentration–time data collected after single and multiple dose administration. lloq values were treated as zero unless
the lloq sample occurred between tmax and tlast, in which case
they were treated as missing. drug concentrations at each sample
collection time were summarized descriptively (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, maximum, and coefﬁcient of variation) by
treatment group. the achievement of steady state was conﬁrmed
by visual examination of the graphical displays of mean trough
drug concentrations.
for the primary analysis, auc(0t) and cmax values in the
logarithmic scale for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  were analyzed using a linear
model with sequence, treatment group, and period as ﬁxed
effects, and subject nested within sequence as a random effect
[16]. the least square (ls) means of each treatment, treatment
differences, and 90% conﬁdence intervals (cis) of the differences
for auc(0t) and cmax between 15 mg  xxxd216xxx  and 12 or 24 mg
racemic  xxxd2155xxx  were derived from this model. the results
were transformed to the original scale by exponentiation to obtain
geometric ls means, treatment ratios, and 90% cis of these ratios.
the same approach was used for the secondary analysis of
auc(0n). other pk parameters were summarized descriptively
by treatment after the ﬁrst dose (day 1) and at steady state (postlast dose, day 14).
descriptive statistics were calculated by treatment group
for each efﬁcacy and safety endpoint. spirometry measurements
collected within 6 h following rescue medication use were
excluded.

3. results
thirty-nine subjects were randomly allocated, received study
medication (itt population), and had evaluable pk data (pk
population). thirty-three subjects (84.6%) completed the trial and
received all treatments. of those subjects who did not complete
the trial, two subjects each voluntarily withdrew, withdrew due to
protocol violations, and discontinued due to adverse events
(bronchitis and vomiting during treatment with 12 and 24 mg
racemic  xxxd2155xxx , respectively). subjects were approximately 65
years of age (range: 48–79 years), and the cohort consisted mostly
of males (56.4%) and caucasians (89.7%). these subjects had
moderate to severe copd (mean fev1 of 1.4 l; 44% predicted).
visual inspection of the means and distributions of individual
trough values from days 12 to 13 indicated steady-state levels
were achieved for all treatments. mean steady-state (day 14)
plasma concentrations of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  over time are shown in
fig. 1 (open symbols) for each treatment. nebulized  xxxd216xxx 
15 mg produced similar (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  plasma exposure (cmax
and auc) to 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi, and 40% lower than
that of 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi (tables 1 and 2). the results
were similar following single doses (data not shown).
treatment with 15 mg  xxxd216xxx  for 14 days provided similar
accumulation of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  plasma concentrations compared with 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  (approximately 2.5fold). there were no meaningful differences in absorption rate
across treatments after 14 days, with a median tmax of 0.9 h for
15 mg  xxxd216xxx , 0.6 h for 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx , and 0.8 h
for 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx . the elimination rate (based on
median t 12) of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  after  xxxd216xxx  treatment for 14
days was similar to that obtained after the racemic  xxxd2155xxx

were below the limit of quantiﬁcation (0.5 pg/ml).

treatments (median t½ range across treatments: 14–17 h)
(table 1).
no subject had detectable levels of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  prior to
dosing. measurable (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was observed in all subjects
administered 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  at steady state.
only isolated samples (two out of 452 total samples) from two
 xxxd216xxx -treated subjects had detectable levels of (s,s) xxxd2155xxx  after 14 days. mean steady-state plasma concentrations of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  following treatment with racemic
 xxxd2155xxx  are shown in fig. 1 (closed symbols).
steady-state (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  mean cmax values tended to be
moderately higher than mean cmax values for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ,
while mean auc(0t) values were similar for each analyte. median
tmax for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was 0.8 to 1 h after racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
treatments, suggesting rapid absorption of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . the
terminal phase t1/2 for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was shorter, with median
t1/2 values of 6–12 h compared with 14–17 h for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
following administration of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  (table 3).
the mean percent increases in trough fev1 after 14 days of
treatment were similar for all treatments: 19.1% in the  xxxd216xxx  group, 16.0% in the 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  group, and
18.2% in the 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  groups. for some endpoints,
the extent of improvement in airway function decreased from
days 1 to 14. while the greatest decreases from days 1 to 14 were
observed for those endpoints that assessed changes from predose
fev1, this was due predominantly to increases in trough fev1
rather than tolerance to the bronchodilating efﬁcacy of the drugs.
moreover, peak percent predicted fev1 values did not diminish
over time.
there were similar consistent improvements observed for the
other efﬁcacy endpoints (table 4). upon visual examination, the
concentration–time proﬁles of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  for all three
treatments paralleled the percent increases in trough fev1 over
time (fig. 2).
the percentage of subjects treated with  xxxd216xxx  who
experienced at least 1 adverse event was 28.6%. the percentages
in the 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  groups were 37.1% and
36.1%, respectively. the most common adverse events were
respiratory in nature. beta-mediated adverse events occurred
infrequently and included nervousness during treatment with
 xxxd216xxx ; and nervousness and tremor during treatment with
24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx . two adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment: bronchitis, the only serious adverse
event reported during the trial (12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx ); and
vomiting (24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx ).

a
for auc(0t) and cmax values in the logarithmic scale for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  were analyzed using a linear model with sequence, treatment group, and period as ﬁxed
effects, and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. the least square (ls) means of each treatment, treatment differences, and 90% conﬁdence intervals (cis) of
the differences for auc(0t) and cmax between 15 mg  xxxd216xxx  and 12 or 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  were derived from this model. the results were transformed to the
original scale by exponentiation to obtain geometric ls means, treatment ratios, and 90% cis of these ratios. the same approach was used for the secondary analysis of
auc(0n).

hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis parameters were
normal both at predose and at the end of the trial (data not
shown). mean pre-ﬁrst dose serum potassium levels ranged from
4.3 to 4.4 meq/l across the treatment groups. at 2 h post-dose,
potassium levels were essentially unchanged in all groups (mean
changes of 0.03 to 0.09 meq/l). six hours post-dose, mean
decreases were observed in all groups: 0.32 meq/l for  xxxd216xxx , and 0.20 and 0.21 meq/l for 12 and 24 mg racemic
 xxxd2155xxx , respectively. no subject had an absolute serum
potassium level o3.0 meq/l. mean serum glucose levels prior to
the ﬁrst dose ranged from 100.3 to 104.5 mg/dl. only small
changes from predose were observed in all groups (mean changes
of 1.9 to 5.3 mg/dl). mean increases in glucose levels were
observed 6 h after dosing for all treatments: 38.9 mg/dl for
 xxxd216xxx , and 25.2 and 40.5 mg/dl for 12 and 24 mg racemic
 xxxd2155xxx , respectively.
there were no clinically signiﬁcant changes from predose
assessments in mean heart rate, blood pressure, body tempera-

ture, or respiratory rate during any treatment (data not shown).
one subject had a clinically signiﬁcant ecg ﬁnding (ventricular
extrasystole on the ﬁrst day of dosing with 24 mg racemic
 xxxd2155xxx , all other ecgs in this subject were normal). no
clinically relevant physical examination ﬁndings were noted
except that respiratory-related abnormalities decreased from
61% of subjects at the start of the trial to 27% in those who
completed.

4. discussion
advances in the sensitivity of bioanalytical assays have
permitted quantiﬁcation of the individual (r,r) and (s,s) isomers
of  xxxd2155xxx  evaluated in plasma samples in concentrations as
low as 0.5 pg/ml [9]. this study compared the in vivo effect of
15 mg nebulized  xxxd216xxx  with that of 12 and 24 mg racemic
 xxxd2155xxx  dpi upon various pk parameters, including the relative

exposure to the  xxxd2155xxx  isomers among each of the three
groups.
steady-state exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  in copd subjects
was similar following administration (14 days) of nebulized
 xxxd216xxx  15 mg (containing 15 mg (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ) and race-

mic  xxxd2155xxx  12 mg dpi (containing 6 mg (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ). cmax
after 14 days was about 9% lower and auc(0t) was about 16%
greater in these copd subjects administered 15 mg  xxxd216xxx 
when compared with those administered 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx . the results are consistent with estimates of delivered amounts
of each drug obtained from in vitro drug delivery studies [7,8].
treatment with 15 mg nebulized  xxxd216xxx  resulted in 53%
lower cmax and 42% lower auc(0t) relative to 24 mg racemic
 xxxd2155xxx  dpi, although the nominal amount of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
was slightly higher for nebulized  xxxd216xxx  (15 mg vs. 12 mg). in
addition, a dose proportional increase in (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  plasma
concentrations was observed when the dose of racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
increased from 12 to 24 mg.
accumulation of plasma concentrations of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ,
based upon rauc(0t) and rcmax (ratio of day14/day1 values) was
similar across treatments and was approximately 2.5-fold across
all treatment groups. these observations were consistent with a
median terminal t1/2 of about 14–17 h. no signiﬁcant differences
were observed in tmax values across treatments, indicating that
absorption rates were similar. tmax values after a single dose were
qualitatively similar to that seen after multiple dose administration across treatments.
measurable (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was observed in all subjects
administered 12 and 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx , but was seen in
only isolated samples from two  xxxd216xxx -treated subjects.
these results indicate that in vivo chiral inversion did not occur
during treatment with  xxxd216xxx . despite the presence of
equivalent proportions of (s,s)- and (r,r)-isomers in the racemate,
(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  levels and exposure parameters were as high or
higher than those of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx . median tmax values for (s,s) xxxd2155xxx  were 0.8–1 h after the racemic  xxxd2155xxx  treatments,
suggesting rapid absorption of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . the terminal
phase t1/2 for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was shorter than that of (r,r) xxxd2155xxx .
visual inspection of the mean time-matched plasma concentrations of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  and the mean percent change in fev1
(fig. 2), suggests that systemic exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  was
related to changes in airway function. the results indicate that at
steady state, systemic exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  and improvement in airway function are similar following treatment with
15 mg  xxxd216xxx  administered via nebulization and 12 mg
racemic  xxxd2155xxx  administered via dpi.
there was similar bronchodilator efﬁcacy for all treatments in
the current study. this result is consistent with that reported in a

single-dose cross-over study in which asthmatic patients received
two different doses of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  (4.5 and 36 mg) and
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (2.25 and 18 mg) [17]. all treatments were well
tolerated: there was only one serious adverse event, and few
treatment-emergent beta-mediated adverse events. changes in
other beta-mediated effects (i.e., serum potassium and glucose
concentrations, heart rate) were similar across treatment groups.
in conclusion, steady-state exposure to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  in
copd subjects was similar following 14 days of administration of
either 15 mg nebulized  xxxd216xxx  or 12 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
dpi, and lower than that with 24 mg racemic  xxxd2155xxx  dpi. there
were no clinically meaningful differences in the rate of absorption,
drug accumulation, or t1/2 in any of the treatment groups. all
treatments resulted in similar and clinically meaningful improvement in airway function, evident after the ﬁrst dose and over 14
days both at the end of and throughout the 12-h dosing interval.
changes in serum potassium, glucose, and heart rate were similar
across treatment groups and were not clinically meaningful, and
all treatments were well tolerated.
