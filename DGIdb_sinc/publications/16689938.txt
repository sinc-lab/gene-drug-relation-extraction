new enzymes of nicotine catabolism instrumental in the detoxiﬁcation of
the tobacco alkaloid by arthrobacter nicotinovorans  xxxg2178xxx  have been identiﬁed and characterized. nicotine breakdown leads to the formation of
nicotine blue from the hydroxylated pyridine ring and of c-n-methylaminobutyrate (ch3- xxxd2177xxx ) from the pyrrolidine ring of the
molecule. surprisingly, two alternative pathways for the ﬁnal steps in the
catabolism of ch3- xxxd2177xxx  could be identiﬁed. ch3- xxxd2177xxx  may be demethylated to c-n-aminobutyrate by the recently identiﬁed
c-n-methylaminobutyrate oxidase [chiribau et al. (2004) eur j biochem
271, 4677–4684]. in an alternative pathway, an amine oxidase with noncovalently bound fad and of novel substrate speciﬁcity removed methylamine
from ch3- xxxd2177xxx  with the formation of succinic semialdehyde.
succinic semialdehyde was converted to succinate by a nadp+-dependent
succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. succinate may enter the  xxxd1710xxx 
cycle completing the catabolism of the pyrrolidine moiety of nicotine.
expression of the genes of these enzymes was dependent on the presence of
nicotine in the growth medium. thus, two enzymes of the nicotine  xxxd313xxx ,
c-n-methylaminobutyrate oxidase and amine oxidase share the same substrate. the km of 2.5 mm and kcat of 1230 s)1 for amine oxidase vs. km of
140 lm and kcat of 800 s)1 for c-n-methylaminobutyrate oxidase, determined in vitro with the puriﬁed recombinant enzymes, may suggest that
demethylation predominates over deamination of ch3- xxxd2177xxx .
however, bacteria grown on [14c]nicotine secreted [14c]methylamine into
the medium, indicating that the pathway to succinate is active in vivo.

one of the major health risks continues to be the smoking of tobacco. nicotine, in itself highly toxic, when
inhaled with the tobacco smoke readily crosses the
blood–brain barrier. its effects on the central nervous
system, mediated by cholinergic receptors, make it
highly addictive. as a result of nicotine addiction, only
a small percentage of smokers give up smoking [1]. in

addition, exposure to tobacco smoke in public places,
so-called secondary smoking, or to solid or liquid
waste during processing of tobacco products, represents a serious health threat. therefore detoxiﬁcation
of these tobacco waste products by removal of nicotine
is a major challenge. several soil microorganisms have
evolved the enzymatic ability to mineralize nicotine,

but only the enzymes of nicotine catabolism of
arthrobacter nicotinovorans  xxxg2178xxx  have been characterized into some detail [2]. knowledge of the enzymes
involved in nicotine catabolism will have applications
not only in the bioremediation of nicotine waste, but
also in the supply of nicotine derivatives as starting
materials for the synthesis of new products of industrial and pharmaceutical importance [3,4]. construction of inducible mammalian systems responsive to
nicotine and nicotine metabolites are feasible [5]. to
achieve such goals, an in-depth understanding of the
enzymology of nicotine catabolism is required.
our effort is directed towards the comprehensive
characterization of the metabolic pathways of nicotine
breakdown as it is present in the gram-positive soil
bacterium a. nicotinovorans [6]. a key step in the
breakdown of nicotine by a. nicotinovorans carrying
the catabolic plasmid  xxxg2178xxx  is the cleavage of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine into 2,6-dihydroxypyridine
and c-n-methylaminobutyrate (ch3- xxxd2177xxx ) by 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine hydrolase
(dhponh, fig. 1). this reaction is performed by a
c–c bond hydrolase of the a ⁄ b fold family, the ﬁrst
shown to act on a heteroaromatic compound [7]. we

c-n-methylaminobutyrate catabolism

have recently shown that a gene cluster on  xxxg2178xxx  is
involved in the demethylation of ch3- xxxd2177xxx . it consists of mabo, encoding the enzyme c-nmethylaminobutyrate oxidase (mabo, fig. 1), which
oxidatively demethylates ch3- xxxd2177xxx . this
gene is ﬂanked by a puru-like gene encoding a putative
formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase and by a fold-like
gene, encoding the putative bifunctional enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate (ch2th4) dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase [8]. expression of the puru-mabo-fold
operon is regulated by the transcriptional activator
pmfr and depends on the presence of nicotine in the
growth medium [9].
catabolism of  xxxd2177xxx  produced in the
mabo reaction could also proceed by oxidative deamination yielding succinic semialdehyde (fig. 1, mao
broken arrow). a succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg138xxx , fig. 1) would then channel the succinate
formed in the reaction into the  xxxd1710xxx  cycle.
indeed, next to the puru-mabo-fold operon there is
on  xxxg2178xxx  a gabd-like gene (sad), encoding an  xxxg138xxx 
protein and a mao-like gene, encoding an amine oxidase (ao) (fig. 2).
in this work, we show that expression of these genes
depends on the presence of nicotine in the growth
medium and we have determined the enzyme activities
of the proteins. our results demonstrate the presence
of two pathways of ch3- xxxd2177xxx  catabolism,
one yielding  xxxd2177xxx  by oxidative demethylation through mabo [8], and the other, by unexpected
new enzyme speciﬁcity, yielding succinic semialdehyde
by removing methylamine in an oxidative deamination
reaction catalyzed by the ao (fig. 1).  xxxd3251xxx 
semialdehyde is then converted to succinate by the
 xxxg138xxx  encoded by the sad gene of  xxxg2178xxx  (see fig. 2).
succinate may enter the  xxxd1710xxx  cycle, thus completing the catabolic pathway of ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
generated from the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine.

would expect them also to be expressed in a nicotinedependent manner. in order to investigate this, we
analyzed the transcription of these genes in the presence and absence of nicotine in the growth medium by
rt-pcr. the results presented in fig. 2b conﬁrmed
the expectation that these genes are transcribed only in
the presence of nicotine, as was the case for the mabo
gene.
the mao-like gene encodes an ao
the mao gene expressed from ph6ex3 produced a
fusion protein with an n-terminal extension reading
mspihhhhhhlvprgsv. the ﬁrst amino acid of
mao is valine (underlined v in the one letter amino
acid code). the protein eluted from the nickel-chelating sepharose column had an intense yellow colour,
indicating formation of a ﬂavoprotein. it showed a
characteristic ﬂavin spectrum with maxima at 450 nm
and a shoulder at 470 nm (fig. 3b). examined by
page on 10% sds gels, ao migrated in good
accordance with its calculated relative molecular
mass of 46 100 (fig. 3a). when precipitated with
10% trichloroacetic acid (tca), the sample formed
a white protein pellet and a yellow supernatant,
showing that the ﬂavin cofactor was not covalently
bound to the protein and thin layer chromatography
1530

(tlc) indicated that the cofactor was fad (not
shown). gel permeation chromatography revealed
that the protein was a monomer in solution (not
shown).
monoamine oxidase activity could be also detected
with  xxxd2177xxx  as substrate, but surprisingly,
the enzyme utilized ch3- xxxd2177xxx  with high
efﬁciency. it removed the secondary amine of ch3-4aminobutyrate and the reaction products were methylamine (fig. 3c) and succinic semialdehyde (see below).
thus, the enzyme behaved as an amine oxidase rather
than as a monoamine oxidase. the ph optimum was
found to be 9.8. the km and kcat of ao with ch3-4aminobutyrate as substrate was 2.5 ± 0.2 mm and
1230 ± 20 s)1, respectively (table 1), as compared
with the previously determined km of 140 lm and kcat
of 800 s)1 for mabo [8]. it may be observed that the
catalytic efﬁciency of mabo for ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
(kcat ⁄ km of 5.71 lm)1æs)1) was approximately 10-fold
higher as compared with that of ao (kcat ⁄ km of
0.49 lm)1æs)1). with  xxxd2177xxx  as substrate, the
ao activity was much reduced (see table 1).
ao was inactive with the following compounds
tested as substrates: spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx , sarcosine,
dimethylglycine, glycine, choline, betaine, a-methylamino
isobutyric acid, methylamine propionnitrile, methylamino propylamine.

in order to conﬁrm the formation of succinic semialdehyde in the reaction of ao with ch3- xxxd2177xxx ,
a coupled assay was performed with ao and  xxxg138xxx .
the  xxxg138xxx  reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by the reduction of nadp+
(fig. 4a,b). the same  xxxg138xxx  activity was determined
in the coupled assay as the  xxxg138xxx  activity determined
with succinic semialdehyde as substrate. this identiﬁed
this compound as the second product of the ao reaction with ch3- xxxd2177xxx . as expected, the
reduction of nadp+ was decreased when  xxxd2177xxx  was employed as substrate in the coupled assay,
demonstrating that ao deaminates  xxxd2177xxx  to
succinic semialdehyde with reduced efﬁciency. when
ao was replaced with mabo in the coupled assay
with ch3- xxxd2177xxx  as substrate, no nadp+
reduction was observed (fig. 4a). this result was predicted, as the product of the mabo reaction is  xxxd2177xxx , which is not a substrate for  xxxg138xxx .
when, besides ao and  xxxg138xxx , increasing amounts
of mabo were introduced in the coupled reaction
with ch3- xxxd2177xxx  as substrate, the measured
nadph production slowed down (fig. 4b). this indicated that the two enzymes indeed competed for the
same substrate. as mabo has an approximately
10-fold higher catalytic activity than ao, in its presence,
the predominant reaction product is  xxxd2177xxx ,
and thus reduction of nadp+ was slowed down.
since  xxxd2177xxx  is also a poor substrate for ao,
which in this case acts as a monoamine oxidase and
transforms  xxxd2177xxx  into succinic semialde-

discussion
the mao-like protein encoded by the mao gene of
 xxxg2178xxx  was shown here to be an amine oxidase. like
polyamine oxidases [10–12] it acts upon a secondary
amine, in this case ch3- xxxd2177xxx , giving rise to
methylamine and succinic semialdehyde. its activity
was speciﬁc towards ch3- xxxd2177xxx  and its
monoamine oxidase activity with  xxxd2177xxx  as
substrate was weak. similar to other members of the
polyamine oxidases, the fad cofactor was noncovalently bound to the apoprotein and the c-terminal
ﬁngerprint sequence sggcy of monoamine oxidases,
with c being the cysteine residue to which the fad
cofactor is covalently attached in these enzymes [13],
was replaced by the sequence agga359y.
the second enzyme characterized in this study
showed high similarity to nadp+-dependent  xxxg138xxx 
from various organisms (not shown). it contains the
amino acid consensus patterns of the aldehyde dehydrogenases  xxxd2431xxx  active site (swissprot prosite
ps00687) in the form of me270lggna, and cysteine
acive site (swissprot prosite ps00070) in the form of
geac304taan.
the unexpected ﬁnding that ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
and not  xxxd2177xxx  was the substrate of the ao
and thus both mabo and ao have the same substrate
led us to postulate two pathways for the catabolism of
ch3- xxxd2177xxx  that is generated from the side
chain of 2,6-dihydroxypseudooxynicotine [7]. the ﬁrst
would start with the oxidative demethylation of ch34-aminobutyrate by mabo and result in  xxxd2177xxx , ch2th4 and reduced fadh2 [8]. the methylene
group of ch2th4 can be further oxidized by the gene
products of fold and puru to formaldehyde. in
the ch2th4 dehydrogenase ⁄ cyclohydrolase reaction,
energy is conserved in nadph and formaldehyde
may be assimilated by the embden–meyerhof fructosebisphosphate aldose ⁄ transaldolase variant of the ribulose monophosphate cycle [14,15]. the amino group of
 xxxd2177xxx , the second reaction product in this
pathway, may be transaminated to a-ketoglutarate and
the remaining succinic semialdehyde may be oxidized
to succinate by a succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
[16,17]. this pathway for  xxxd2177xxx  catabolism
is generally found in bacteria [18–20]. it also appears
to be active in a. nicotinovorans, independent of the
presence of the megaplasmid  xxxg2178xxx , since both strains,
with and without  xxxg2178xxx , were able to grow on  xxxd2177xxx  as the carbon source.
the second,  xxxg2178xxx -encoded pathway would start with
the newly discovered reaction of ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
deamination to succinic semialdehyde and methylamine

c-n-methylaminobutyrate catabolism

catalyzed by ao. in this reaction fad is reduced to
fadh2. the  xxxg2178xxx -encoded  xxxg138xxx  then produces succinate, which enters the  xxxd1710xxx  cycle, and nadph.
a. nicotinovorans devoid of  xxxg2178xxx  was not able to grow
on ch3- xxxd2177xxx . a. nicotinovorans  xxxg2178xxx  was
able to grow on ch3- xxxd2177xxx  only in the presence of low amounts of nicotine added as inducer of the
nicotine degradation pathway (ganas and brandsch,
unpublished). therefore, it is reasonable to assume
that  xxxg2178xxx  encoded ao and  xxxg138xxx  have evolved
speciﬁcally for the catabolism of ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
produced from nicotine. methylamine can be used
by the facultative methylotroph arthrobacter strain
p1 [15], but a. nicotinovorans could not grow on
methylamine, which instead appeared in the growth
medium when the bacteria was grown in the presence
of nicotine.
both pathways may lead to the complete mineralization of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine, which after
oxidation by 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase, is cleaved
off from the pyridine ring of nicotine in the form of
ch3- xxxd2177xxx . each of these pathways starts
with an enzyme speciﬁc for an unusual substrate.
mabo may have derived from a sarcosine oxidase [8]
by increasing its substrate speciﬁcity to ch3- xxxd2177xxx , a compound with two additional c-units as
compared to sarcosine. ao still has a very low monoamine oxidase catalytic activity towards  xxxd2177xxx , but is speciﬁc for the oxidative deamination of
the secondary amine of ch3- xxxd2177xxx . apparently there was a selective pressure during the establishment of nicotine catabolism for the evolution of
new enzyme speciﬁcities starting from enzymes with
sarcosine oxidase and polyamine oxidase activities.
we must ask our selves which pathway predominates
in vivo. from the in vitro kinetic data one would predict
a preferentially channelling of ch3- xxxd2177xxx 
to the demethylation pathway, since the kcat ⁄ km of
mabo show it to be approximately 10 times more catalytically active than the deaminating ao. we do not
know at the moment how the in vivo competition of the
two enzymes for the same substrate is regulated. additional work will be required to answer this question.
however, under the experimental conditions used,
methylamine is secreted into the growth medium, which
shows that the deamination pathway is active in vivo.

95 c for 1 min, 54 c for 45 s, 72 c for 2 min, repeated
30 times and followed by 72 c for 10 min. the ampliﬁed

a 100 ml preculture of e. coli xl-1blue harbouring
ph 6ex3mao or ph 6ex3sad was diluted 1 : 10 in 1 l of
lb medium. after 2 h at 37 c, expression of the genes
was induced for 4–5 h at 30 c with 1 mm iptg. preparation of bacterial extracts and puriﬁcation of the proteins
on high performance nickel-chelating sepharose was as described previously [8]. the recombinant proteins were stable
for several weeks at 4 c with minor precipitation. the
isolated proteins were analyzed by sds ⁄ page on 10%
polyacrylamide gels. superdex s-200 permeation chromatography, for determining the size of the native proteins,
was performed with the aid of an äkta device (amersham biosciences, freiburg, germany).

determination of enzyme activities
ao activity was tested using the peroxidase coupled assay
[8]. the 1-ml assay consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 9.8, 0.0007% o-dianisidine, 10 u horseradish peroxidase (sigma), and 10 lg ao. the reaction was
initiated by the addition of 10 mm substrate (ch3- xxxd2177xxx  or  xxxd2177xxx ). the oxidation of o-dianisidine was monitored at room temperature by the increase in
absorption at 430 nm.
 xxxg138xxx  activity was measured in a 1 ml assay which
contained: 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, ph 9,
5 mm edta, 500 lm nad+ or nadp+ and 1.5 lg
 xxxg138xxx . the reaction was started by the addition of 1.5 mm
succinic semialdehyde substrate. the reduction of nad+
or nadp+ was monitored by the increase in absorption at
340 nm for 5 min at room temperature.

a coupled ao- xxxg138xxx  assay was performed in 1 ml consisting of: 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, ph 9,
5 mm edta, 500 lm nadp+, 10 lg ao (which retains
100% activity under these reaction conditions) and 1.5 lg
 xxxg138xxx . the reaction was started by the addition of 10 mm
ch3- xxxd2177xxx  and the reduction of nadp+ was
monitored at 340 nm in an ultrospec 3100 spectrophotometer (amersham biosciences).

tlc of the reaction products of the enzyme
assays
identiﬁcation of ch3nh2 and  xxxd2177xxx  produced
in the enzyme assays with ao and mabo was performed
by tlc on polygram cel300 plates (macherey-nagel,
düren, germany) with n-butanol ⁄ pyridine ⁄ acetic acid ⁄ h2o
(10 : 15 : 3 : 12 v ⁄ v ⁄ v ⁄ v) as mobile phase [8]. the plates
were developed by spraying with a 0.1% (v ⁄ v) ninhydrin
solution in acetone.

identification of [14c]methylamine in the medium
of [14c]nicotine grown a. nicotinovorans  xxxg2178xxx 
a. nicotinovorans  xxxg2178xxx  bacteria grown to the stationary
phase were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with
minimal salts medium and ﬁnally resuspended in minimal
salts medium supplemented with l-[14c]nicotine (200 lm) in
the presence or absence of ammonium sulfate. aliquots of
the growth medium were removed at different time points
and analyzed by tlc for the presence of [14c]methylamine
as described above. the tlc plates were exposed to
kodak x-omat ar x-ray ﬁlms (sigma, taufkirchen,
germany) for various times.

growth of a. nicotinovorans carrying or lacking
 xxxg2178xxx  on ch3- xxxd2177xxx ,  xxxd2177xxx 
or methylamine
ch3- xxxd2177xxx ,  xxxd2177xxx  or methylamine (2
gæl)1) replaced citrate as carbon source in the minimal
medium [21] in these experiments. biotin at 41 nm ﬁnal concentration was added as vitamin supplement to the bacterial
cultures. an a. nicotinovorans overnight culture (150 ll)
was diluted 100 times in sterile 50-ml falcon tubes and
growth was monitored by the increase in turbidity at 600 nm.
