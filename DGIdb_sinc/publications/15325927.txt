although the benefits of carvedilol in patients with heart
failure and depressed ejection fraction (ef) have been elucidated, those in patients with preserved ef are not understood. we enrolled 40 patients with mild or moderate
heart failure and ef >45%. they were randomly assigned
to carvedilol (n ⴝ 19) or conventional therapy (n ⴝ 21).
after 12 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly improved all end points (plasma concentration of b-type natriuretic peptide [bnp] from 175 (35 to 209) to 106 (52 to
160) pg/ml, mean (95% confidence interval) p <0.01;

4.75 (4.50 to 5.00) to 5.68 (5.22 to 6.14) mets, p <0.02),
whereas conventional therapy did not (plasma bnp concentration from 150 (114 to 186) to 174 (100 to 248)

2.29 (2.08 to 2.50) to 2.11 (1.73 to 2.49); exercise capacity from 4.57 (4.34 to 4.80) to 4.72 (4.41 to 5.03) mets).
univariate regression analyses showed that only the use of
carvedilol was correlated with the decrease in plasma bnp
concentration (p <0.03). multivariate analyses demonstrated that an ischemic cause of heart failure (p <0.02),
high plasma concentration of bnp (p <0.02), left ventricular dilation (p <0.03), and use of carvedilol (p <0.04) at
baseline were predictive of a decrease in plasma concentration of bnp. in conclusion, carvedilol potentially decreased neurohumoral activation, decreased symptoms,
and increased exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and preserved ef. 䊚2004 by excerpta medica, inc.

american heart association guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic heart failure in the
adult.6 all patients met framingham criteria for diagnosis of heart failure. lvef, as assessed by echocardiography using simpson’s method, was ⱖ45% in

with primary significant valvular disease, cor pulmonale, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes mellitus with hemoglobin a1c ⬎8%, alcohol abuse, other systemic
diseases, obvious contraindication to carvedilol, or
using  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists or adrenergic
blockers were excluded from the initial entry. patients
had been treated with conventional therapy using  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors, diuretics,
and/or digitalis for ⱖ3 months before baseline evaluations; 8 patients were excluded due to complete resolution of symptoms, a subsequent decrease in plasma
concentration of bnp to ⬍50.0 pg/ml, or contraindication to carvedilol. we finally entered 40 patients (21
men and 19 women; 49 to 80 years old) into the
present study after obtaining written consent. we performed the baseline evaluation as described in the
following within 30 days.
baseline evaluations: in each patient we determined
the nyha functional class and exercise capacity as
defined by the specific activity scale expressed as

treatment: at the outpatient clinic, carvedilol was
administered to 19 randomly selected patients at an

initial daily dosage of 1.25 mg in addition to conventional therapy, and the dose was doubled every week
until reaching ⱖ5 mg/day. the decision to increase
carvedilol to ⬎5 mg/day was made by the attending
cardiologists on the basis of subjective symptoms,
physical findings, and chest roentgenography; the cardiologists were guided to increase carvedilol to 20
mg/day if the patient tolerated it. therapy was discontinued when chest roentgenography and/or physical
findings suggested the presence of exacerbation of
heart failure. after the initial administration of carvedilol, all patients visited our heart failure clinic every
month. we provided them with guidelines for lifestyle
modification, including a low-salt diet, avoidance of
overwork, and self-monitoring of body weight and
blood pressure on a daily basis. they were advised to
contact the attendant cardiologist in case of obvious
exacerbation of exercise intolerance or edema or an
increase in body weight of ⬎2 kg. when exercise
intolerance (increase in nyha functional class), body
weight increase ⬎2 kg, or progression of edema were
encountered, the attending cardiologist increased the
dosage of furosemide or  xxxd3404xxx  (up to the maximal) but not the dosage of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors or other cardiovascular drugs. in
patients in whom this intervention did not relieve
symptoms of heart failure, the dosage of carvedilol
was halved every 7 days until exacerbation of heart
failure terminated; patients who did not tolerate carvedilol at 5 mg/day were defined as intolerant.
the remaining 21 patients undergoing conventional therapy also visited the heart failure clinic every
month. they were also instructed to follow the previously described lifestyle guidelines. patients who presented with a worsening of heart failure were initially

evaluation of the treatment efficacy
and treatment failure: the efficacy of

carvedilol or conventional therapy
was evaluated with respect to plasma
concentrations of bnp, nyha functional class, and exercise capacity.
exercise capacity was determined by

failure was defined as death from all
causes, hospitalization, use of inotropic agents to treat exacerbation of
heart failure, exercise intolerance at
nyha functional class iv, even after
the previously mentioned treatment
adjustment, or carvedilol intolerance.

discussion
in the present study, the addition of carvedilol to
conventional therapy for 12 months decreased plasma
bnp concentrations, alleviated symptoms, and increased exercise capacity in patients with heart failure
and lvef ⱖ45%. treatment with carvedilol was tolerated as well as conventional therapy. effects of
␤-adrenergic blockers in patients with preserved ef
have not been tested in randomized trials except for
the swedish evaluation of diastolic dysfunction in
congestive heart failure (swedic), but the results
have not been published. further, although the
swedic focused on echographic parameters of diastolic function, our study examined plasma bnp concentrations and symptom status. therefore, the present
study potentially complements the swedic for understanding the effects of carvedilol in patients with
heart failure and preserved ef.
although the present report demonstrated that
there is no significant change in end points in patients
on conventional therapy, we are not implying that
conventional therapy that includes an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor is ineffective, because
the present investigation was not designed to compare
the efficacy of an  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor with carvedilol but to evaluate the effects of
carvedilol in addition to an angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor.
in the present investigation, we used plasma concentrations of bnp as an end point because mortality
rate and frequency of major cardiac events are hard
end points for the small sample size used and the low
august 15, 2004

mortality rate from heart failure in japan.20 the use of
such a surrogate end point might make the interpretation of the present results difficult. however, plasma
bnp concentration is a sensitive marker for the status
of cardiac dysfunction and prognosis of patients with
heart failure and depressed or preserved ef.21–25 accordingly, the decrease in plasma bnp concentration
seen in the present study strongly suggests that carvedilol is beneficial to the prognosis of such patients.
mean dosage of carvedilol in the present study was
10.9 mg/day. although this dosage is low for whites
and blacks, this dosage is common in treatment for
japanese patients; 20 mg/day is considered the maximal dosage of carvedilol for japanese patients.14
moreover, it was reported at the fourth annual congress of the japanese society of heart failure that
carvedilol at 5 mg/day suppressed cardiac events in
japanese patients enrolled in the multicenter carvedilol heart failure dose assessment trial, which is a
nationwide randomized control trial of the effects of
carvedilol on heart failure with depressed ef (unpublished data).
