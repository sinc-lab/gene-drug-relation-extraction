conclusion

10. expert opinion

importance of the field: the role of estrogen deprivation for the treatment of
breast cancer has been understood since the 1800s. pharmacologic advances in
the field in the past decades, including tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors,
have contributed significantly to the reduced mortality of estrogen-sensitive
breast cancer. however, this subtype of breast cancer still presents with relapses
and, once metastatic, progression to hormone-refractory state and loss of
disease control remain an expected disease course.  xxxd2165xxx , a pure estrogen
receptor downregulator, is a new addition to the antiestrogen therapeutic
armamentarium since its fda approval in 2002. its unique mechanism of action
offers potential advantages over other estrogen targeted therapies.
areas covered in this review: published scientific literature, including presented abstracts, on  xxxd2165xxx  from 1985 to the present were reviewed with
selected publications included.
what the reader will gain: this review addresses current issues and therapies
for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer, highlights the role of  xxxd2165xxx  in
current treatment guidelines and outlines some of the ongoing investigations
of this compound.
take home message:  xxxd2165xxx  is an effective and well-tolerated drug for
treatment of metastatic estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. work is underway to
enhance its clinical benefit to patients as a single agent and in combination
with other therapies.

introduction

the incidence and mortality of breast cancer have declined in the usa in last decade,
reflective of advances in prevention, early detection and improved therapeutic options
for established disease [1]. at present, however, there remain approximately 1.3 million
cases diagnosed each year worldwide, with 465,000 deaths a year attributable to breast
cancer, reflecting the ongoing threat and need for enhanced treatment [2]. reliance
upon estrogen for tumor growth is a well-described characteristic of the majority of
breast cancer cases and is clinically demonstrated by the presence of the estrogen
receptor (er) in 83% of postmenopausal and 72% of premenopausal cases [3].
improved methodologies in er testing have established that the presence of the target
is both prognostic for long-term outcomes of disease-free and overall survival, and
predictive of response to antiestrogen-based therapy [4]. recent advances in the
genomic assessment of breast cancer have delineated two potential subsets within
estrogen-sensitive cancers: those with both the er and  xxxg1737xxx  (pr)
present and those in which the pr is absent [5]. these subsets may differ in both their
overall prognosis and potential responses to antiendocrine therapies, though these
concepts remain the subject of study [4,6,7].

the ability to use hormonal manipulation to alter the
growth of breast cancer was initially described in 1896
with the employment of oophorectomy [8]. in subsequent
decades, tamoxifen, a selective er modulator, became the gold
standard therapy for advanced and early-stage estrogensensitive cancers, as well as ultimately a chemoprevention
agent in women of higher risk for the disease [9,10].
a competitive ligand for the er, tamoxifen is capable of
biologic activity as a full antagonist to a full estrogen agonist,
which potentially explains why even initially responsive breast
tumors develop resistance to tamoxifen [11,12]. other endocrine therapies ensued, including progestins, estrogens and
androgens, which were hampered by limited efficacy and
significant side effects. the advent of the third-generation
aromatase inhibitors (ais) and inactivators was the next milestone in advanced and subsequently early-stage endocrinesensitive breast cancers for postmenopausal women. current
adjuvant treatment algorithm in postmenopausal women
since 2005 includes upfront use of an ai for 5 years; or switch
therapy with 2 – 3 years of tamoxifen followed by an ai to
complete 5 years of treatment; or 5 years of tamoxifen followed
by 5 years of an ai [13-15]. studies of longer duration of ai
therapy are ongoing. for premenopausal women with an intact
pituitary-gonadal axis, ais are ineffective and tamoxifen with
or without ovarian ablation are standard approaches. the role
of ais in addition to ovarian ablation and the contribution
of ovarian ablation itself in this patient population are topics
of ongoing research [16].
despite these highly effective therapies for early-stage breast
cancer, 40 – 80% of node-positive and 24 – 30% of nodenegative cases will subsequently present with metastatic
recurrence. long-term survival in this setting remains
uncommon [17]. given the exposure of most breast cancer
808

patients to tamoxifen and/or an ai in the adjuvant setting,
new antiendocrine approaches for recurrent disease remain an
important drug development goal, as many tumors retain
estrogen dependence at this juncture [6]. one such agent, now
a standard therapy for this disease setting, is the direct er
antagonist  xxxd2165xxx  (box 1, figure 1). it is the sole member of
its unique class of antiestrogen therapy with human clinical
trial results published to date. a second er downregulator
with oral activity has demonstrated similar antitumor activity
with enhanced er downregulation potency in human breast
cancer xenografts, though no human clinical data are yet
available [18]. here we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical studies that have led to the widespread use of  xxxd2165xxx  for er-expressing advanced breast
cancer; as well as outline the ongoing issues and research
opportunities for this compound.
2.

introduction to the compound

 xxxd2165xxx  is a pure er antagonist that directly competes with
estrogen for er binding. it binds, blocks and increases
degradation of er protein and subsequent er signaling,
hence its being termed an er downregulator [19]. it has no
agonist effect, and to achieve adequate er inhibition its
presence has to be sustained [19].
3.

chemistry

 xxxd2165xxx  belongs to a new class of steroidal antiestrogens, a
7-alkylsulphinyl analog of estradiol [20]. its full chemical name
is 7-alpha[9-(4,4,5,5,5-penta fluoropentylsulphinyl) nonyl]
estra-1,3,5,(10)-triene3, xxxd2037xxx  diol (box 1). the chemical
compound is  xxxd2165xxx , and  xxxd2165xxx  is the long-acting

form of this compound. it is a white powder with a molecular weight of 606.77. the solution for injection is a clear
viscous liquid.
4.

pharmacodynamics

as an er inhibitor,  xxxd2165xxx  directly competes with estrogen for binding to er. the affinity of  xxxd2165xxx  to er is 89%
of estrogen [21]. by contrast, the affinity of tamoxifen is only
2.5% of estrogen. the side-chain of the compound prevents
dimerization of er, therefore blocking a necessary step in gene
transcription activation. both er transcriptional activating
factors 1 and 2 are disabled by this process, which in turn
affect downstream targets including the  xxxg1737xxx 
that is downregulated [22]. prevention of dimerization leads to
rapid degradation of the receptor [22]. this fact is supported by
the observed decrease in er protein but no change in mrna
content in response to  xxxd2165xxx  both in vivo and
in vitro [23,24]. in addition, a decrease in er shuttling to
the nucleus has been described that may potentiate er
degradation. the level of downregulation of er by  xxxd2165xxx 
demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship [25].
5.

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

oral delivery of  xxxd2165xxx  has been explored in animals and
humans [26]. however, low bioavailability and presystemic
metabolism precluded further development of this delivery
route. parenteral administration of  xxxd2165xxx  has been extensively tested with pharmacokinetics of intravenous and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations well defined. we discuss i.m.
administration further as it has been proven the most effective
and is now the approved method of delivery.

single-dose pharmacokinetic studies of a short-acting i.m.
formulation of  xxxd2165xxx  (doses 2 – 36 mg) showed
maximum plasma concentration achieved at 12 – 24 h postinjection [26]. single dosing of long-acting  xxxd2165xxx  at 250 mg
i.m. demonstrated a variable maximum plasma concentration
at 2 – 19 days. the plasma concentration declined slowly with a
measurable concentration over 28 days [27]. both single (5 ml)
and split dosing (2  2.5 ml) of long-acting  xxxd2165xxx 
were tested with no difference in plasma concentrations [28].
monthly dosing at 50, 100 and 250 mg long-acting  xxxd2165xxx 
showed detectable serum concentrations at day 28 in three or
four subjects at 100 mg and all receiving 250 mg [29,30].
based on these preliminary results, the initial phase iii studies
detailed later were initiated with both 125-mg and 250-mg
long-acting monthly dosing arms. the 125-mg arm was closed
at the first interim analysis for futility, and all subsequent
clinical investigation has been conducted at the 250-mg i.m.
dosing level or higher [31].
a postmarketing, phase ii study reported the pharmacokinetics of 500 mg  xxxd2165xxx  i.m. that included loading on
days 0, 14 and 28 and compared it with standard dose [32].
in this study of 208 women, the  xxxd2165xxx  plasma concentrations and exposure were higher in the high-dose group
compared with the low-dose group. cmax at 4 weeks was
24.5 versus 8.8 ng/ml with an auc of 12,804 versus
4005 ngh/ml respectively.
 xxxd2165xxx  is converted to ketone, sulfate and glucuronide
metabolites by modifications at the 3 and 17 positions of the
steroid nucleus, and into sulfone by modification at the
9-position before excretion. the primary excretory metabolites are  xxxd2165xxx  and its 17-keto and sulfone metabolites.
the major route of excretion is by feces (up to 90% in
parenteral trials) with < 1% of  xxxd2165xxx  excreted in urine [33].

expert opin. pharmacother. (2010) 11(5)

 xxxd2165xxx 

pharmacological in vitro testing of the excreted metabolites
has shown no estrogen activity. from the metabolites tested
only the 17-keto form has residual antiestrogen activity, albeit
4.5 times weaker than the native compound. cytochrome
p450 interactions have been evaluated, with an emphasis on
the cyp3a4 isoform, and testing with compounds such as
ketoconazole, midazolam or rifampicin [34]. no interactions
affecting the safety or efficacy of the drug have been observed.
in addition, no dose adjustments are needed for patients with
renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment [33].
6.

clinical efficacy

phase i studies
confirming preclinical results, the first phase i study of shortacting  xxxd2165xxx  demonstrated a decrease in er, pr and
ki-67 proliferative index in the tumors of postmenopausal
women who received drug before surgical resection for 7 days
at a dose of 6 – 18 mg daily [25]. minimal side effects
were reported and there was no effect on the liver or the
hypothalamic-pituitary axis [35]. a similar phase i study in
premenopausal women awaiting hysterectomy for benign
gynecologic indications demonstrated reduction of endometrial thickening despite high estradiol level, supporting
the pure agonist effect of the drug [36].

phase ii studies
important in the treatment of er-positive metastatic breast
cancer is whether cross-resistance to antiendocrine therapy has
developed. eventual loss of the estrogen requirement and
establishment of an er refractory state is the ultimate pathway
in this disease setting. accordingly, a phase ii trial of 80 postmenopausal women with previous progression of disease on ai
therapy and up to one additional hormonal therapy was
done [37]. seventy-three per cent of enrolled subjects did
have two previous hormonal treatments. eleven subjects
(14.3%) achieved a partial response and an additional
16 (20.8%) had stable disease for at least 6 months. median
time to progression in the study was 3 months and median
survival was 20.2 months. a clinical benefit of 30% was
observed in a similar phase ii trial, in which previous response
to ai was not predictive of a response to  xxxd2165xxx  [38].
a limited number of studies evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd2165xxx  in premenopausal women. a randomized,
double-blind, phase ii study examined the effect of a single
dose of 250 mg in 66 premenopausal women with newly
diagnosed breast cancer at 14 – 21 days before surgery with
curative intent [39].  xxxd2165xxx  at this dose had no effect on the
markers of hormone sensitivity or proliferation compared with
placebo. in a similarly designed study, an increased single dose
of  xxxd2165xxx  750 mg was compared with 14 – 16 days of
tamoxifen in premenopausal women with newly diagnosed
breast cancer awaiting surgery [40]. both drugs reduced ki-67
and er levels in the tumor. in addition,  xxxd2165xxx  decreased
the tumor expression of pr and increased the plasma
6.2

concentration of estradiol. this study underscores the
dose dependence of  xxxd2165xxx . no unexpected adverse
events were noted in either study.
phase iii studies
a ‘north american’ (na 0021) and a ‘rest of the world’
(row 0020) randomized phase iii trial compared  xxxd2165xxx 
with anastrozole in the second-line metastatic setting [31,41].
both trials were designed to prove superiority of  xxxd2165xxx  in
efficacy and tolerability. the na study was a double-blind,
double-dummy treatment, whereas the row study was openlabel. the treatment populations were similar for both trials:
postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic
breast cancer whose disease had progressed during adjuvant or
first-line metastatic endocrine therapy. about 200 patients per
treatment arm were enrolled in each study and randomized to
either  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg i.m. monthly or anastrozole 1 mg
p.o. daily, though both studies initially included a 125-mg
arm as previously described. the majority of patients (> 96%)
had disease progression following tamoxifen. there was no
significant difference in time to progression (ttp), overall
response rate (orr), clinical benefit rate or overall survival.
analysis of these trials, importantly, noted a trend towards
longer duration of benefit for those who initially responded to
therapy of 16.7 months compared with 13.7 months favoring
 xxxd2165xxx . a retrospective analysis showed noninferiority of
 xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole in the primary end point of
ttp (5.5 vs 4.1 months; hr = 0.95, ci 0.82 – 1.10)
and secondary end point of orr (difference in orr of
2.75%; ci 2.27 – 9.05%) [42,43].
a phase iii trial compared  xxxd2165xxx  with tamoxifen in the
first-line metastatic setting.  xxxd2165xxx  was administered at
250 mg i.m. (every 28 ± 3 days) [44]. included patients had had
no previous therapy for metastatic disease and no endocrine
therapy in the last 12 months. there was no statistical
difference in ttp, tolerability or quality of life at a median
follow-up of 14.5 months; however,  xxxd2165xxx  did not meet
the criteria for noninferiority in the intent-to-treat population.
based on these accumulated results,  xxxd2165xxx  was
approved for use at 250 mg i.m. monthly dosing. however,
there are concerns as to whether this dose and schedule
provide optimum biologic and clinical effect for the drug.
single-dosing studies noted a dose-dependency for target
tissue effect with no plateau observed in the trial of the
long-acting formulation that stopped at 250 mg i.m. the
percentage er suppression in that study was not as large as
those reported in preclinical xenograft models [19], suggesting
that suboptimal er downregulation may be occurring at
the approved dose level. similarly, the pharmacology subprotocol from the 0020/0021 trials revealed that steady-state
level in peak and trough concentrations were not achieved
until 6 months of the every-28-day dosing at 250 mg
had occurred. suboptimal dosing could, therefore, have
permitted subjects to progress before achieving the desired
pharmacologic drug level.

postmarketing surveillance
post-approval investigations of  xxxd2165xxx  have focused
on altered dosing regimens, with dose-intensification
strategies and/or combination therapy with other agents.
dose-intensification strategies have including a loading dose
schedule to increase the rate at which steady state is achieved
and dose elevation to increase the biologic effects on the er
or both.
the efect trial is the first loading dose schedule of
 xxxd2165xxx  versus exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inactivator [45], in postmenopausal patients with  xxxg1603xxx 
positive disease and disease progression after nonsteroidal
ais [46]. in this trial, the loading dose of  xxxd2165xxx  was
500 mg  xxxd2165xxx  on day 0 followed by 250 mg on days
14 and 28, then monthly. this was a phase iii, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that accrued 693 women whose
disease had recurred within 6 months of an adjuvant nonsteroidal ai or while on said ai for treatment of advanced
breast cancer. one previous chemotherapy regimen for
advanced breast cancer was permitted. there was no statistically significant difference in the primary end point of ttp
(3.7 months in both groups) or clinical benefit (32.2 vs 31.5%
respectively). steady state of the drug was achieved after
1 month. both regimens were well tolerated and there was
no reported difference in quality of life.
two trials investigating maintained dose intensity of  xxxd2165xxx  500 mg have been reported so far in the postmenopausal advanced breast cancer setting. come et al. reported a
phase ii study with  xxxd2165xxx  500 mg on days 0, 14 and 28
and monthly thereafter in 35 patients with er-positive
untreated metastatic breast cancer [47]. on this schedule,
 xxxd2165xxx  was well tolerated with no significant toxicities.
the most commonly reported adverse effect was a temporary
injection site discomfort. the median ttp in this trial was
22 months and the clinical benefit rate 86%. this study proves
that higher  xxxd2165xxx  dosing is feasible and should be
6.4

explored further, given the impressive clinical benefit. in a
similar intent, randomized neoadjuvant trial, kuter et al.
reported on pharmacokinetics of 500-mg dosing [32]. they
were also able to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in target effect and downregulation of er, pr and ki-67
at the higher drug dose. the reported decrease in target levels
was nonlinear and reached a plateau. additional data are
needed to ascertain if these biologic end points result in
improved clinical benefit rate with  xxxd2165xxx  in this study.
in previously reported studies, downregulation of er at
4 – 6 weeks correlated with patients who had subsequently
achieved clinical benefit, not seen in primary progressors, but
did not correlate with median ttp [48,49].
lastly, a randomized phase iii study of 205 postmenopausal women with untreated advanced breast cancer who
received either  xxxd2165xxx  500 mg monthly with an included
day-14, 500-mg loading dose or standard anastrozole 1 mg
p.o. daily has recently been published. objective response rate
( xxxd2165xxx  36%; anastrozole 35.5%) and clinical benefit rate
( xxxd2165xxx  72.5%; anastrozole 67%) were high and similar
for both drugs in this population. time to progression was
significantly longer for  xxxd2165xxx  at a yet unreached end point
for  xxxd2165xxx  compared with 12.5 months for anastrozole
(hr = 0.63, p = 0.0496) [50]. table 1 reviews the phase iii
results from published trials of  xxxd2165xxx  versus the ais.
phase iii studies of  xxxd2165xxx  versus ais versus the combination of the two and  xxxd2165xxx  at 500 mg directly compared
with 250 mg in the second-line setting (figure 2) are ongoing
and will provide more insight into the dosing and optimal
administration of this antiendocrine drug in the setting of
advanced breast cancer.

weight gain and vaginitis were reported in £ 2% of patients
(table 2). importantly, no increase in thromboembolic events
has been observed. overall, no significant differences in
quality-of-life measures have been reported between  xxxd2165xxx  and other antiestrogen therapies. moreover, when compared with anastrozole,  xxxd2165xxx  showed fewer joint
disorders, measured as arthritis, arthralgia and arthrosis
(10.6 vs 5.4%, p = 0.0036) [42]. adding to the favorable
side-effect profile of  xxxd2165xxx  are data regarding long-term
stability of bone turnover markers [52] and an improvement of
lipid profile [53]. as expected,  xxxd2165xxx  behaves as a pure
antiestrogen at the level of uterus, resulting in a decrease
812

in endometrial growth [54]. lastly, no dose-limiting toxicity
has been observed with  xxxd2165xxx  in currently reported
clinical trials.

regulatory affairs

 xxxd2165xxx  is approved by the fda in the usa for the
treatment of hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression
following previous antiestrogen therapy. the recommended
dose is a monthly intramuscular injection of 250 mg. the
level of evidence supporting this recommendation is iib, as
discussed above.
9.

conclusion

 xxxd2165xxx  is at present the lone member of the pure er
downregulator class of antiestrogen therapy. it is efficacious
against er-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to

expert opin. pharmacother. (2010) 11(5)

tamoxifen and at least equivalent to ai therapy in the secondline setting. a modest level of clinical benefit can be achieved
in the post-ai metastatic disease setting as well, which is very
important for those patients with asymptomatic low to moderate disease burden, for whom initiation of chemotherapy
would carry a significant, increased risk of adverse effects.
 xxxd2165xxx  is an extremely well-tolerated drug with no potential for estrogen agonist effect on non-target tissues. the i.m.
route of administration is similarly well tolerated, even at split
dosing, and affords increased monitoring of compliance over
oral drugs. the emerging data on higher-dose and increaseddose intensity support the need for further exploration of this
compound to ensure optimization of administration and
potential enhanced clinical benefit results.

expert opinion

 xxxd2165xxx  for the management of advanced er-positive
breast cancer added an effective and very well-tolerated
drug to the therapeutic choices for this prevalent disease
setting in breast cancer. based on available data and the
now widespread use of ais in the adjuvant setting, it is an
additive option for antiendocrine therapy to be used as a first-,
second- or third-line intervention for postmenopausal breast
cancer continuing to demonstrate an estrogen requirement. its
favorable side-effect profile has placed  xxxd2165xxx  above other
older antiendocrine therapies such as megesterol and diethylstibestrol. for women without impending symptomatic
complications from their disease, it can be effectively used
regardless of the presence of visceral metastasis. it is an
attractive drug compared with tamoxifen and the ais because
of its usual absence of flare phenomenon, little effect on
sex hormone endocrinology, bone metabolism and lipid

biochemistry, absence of significant cyp-mediated drug–
drug interactions and opportunity for enhanced compliance
monitoring [55,56]. when responses are seen, the duration of
clinical benefit can even be prolonged with excellent preservation of normalcy of life for the patient, similar to other
antiendocrine therapies. it has been readily adopted into the
standard-of-care treatment line-up for metastatic breast cancer
and at least two published reports attest to its cost-effectiveness
in the sequential hormonal therapy management of metastatic
estrogen-responsive breast cancer, [57,58], enhancing its global
acceptability. in addition to the aforementioned postmarketing studies of dose escalation, several phase ii clinical trials of
combination with new therapeutics targeting other cellular
pathways, such as her 2 neu, are ongoing. it is hoped that
improved dosing regimens that more reliably achieve desired
target tissue effects and optimal clinical efficacy will permit
inclusion of  xxxd2165xxx  into adjuvant clinical trials for erpositive breast cancer in the next several years. ongoing
combination trials with ais and other non-estrogen pathway
targeted therapies will also guide the future positioning of
 xxxd2165xxx  in the treatment of advanced and early-stage
disease. lastly,  xxxd2165xxx  is making its way into the treatment
of other malignancies, with early clinical trials now reporting
efficacy and tolerability in epithelial ovarian cancer and in
combination with egfr blockade in women with non-smallcell lung cancer [59,60]. we anticipate seeing  xxxd2165xxx 
ultimately incorporated into more than breast cancer therapy
in the future.
