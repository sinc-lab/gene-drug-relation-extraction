phe-205 increases the volume of the cyclooxygenase site
allowing epa to be oxygenated more efficiently than
with native opghs-1.

prostaglandin endoperoxide h synthase (pghs)1 converts
 xxxd208xxx  (aa) to prostaglandin h2 in the committed
step of prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis (1, 2). two
isoforms of pghs exist in mammalian tissues.  xxxg1883xxx  is constitutively expressed and generates prostaglandins in response
to hormone stimulation, whereas  xxxg1884xxx  is an inducible enzyme that is expressed in response to growth factors, tumor
promotors, or cytokines (1–11). both isoforms are quite similar
structurally (12–15) and mechanistically (1, 2, 16), with only
subtle kinetic differences in substrate (17, 18) and inhibitor
(19, 20) specificities, and hydroperoxide activator requirements
(21–23).
both  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 catalyze two different reactions: a cyclooxygenase reaction and a peroxidase reaction. structural
studies indicate that the active sites are spatially distinct from
each other and separated by a heme group (12–15). the cyclooxygenase reaction occurs within a hydrophobic channel
that extends from the membrane binding domain of the enzyme
into the core of the globular domain. the fatty acid substrate is
positioned within this site in an extended l-shaped conformation (15, 24). cyclooxygenase catalysis begins with abstraction
of the 13-pro-s hydrogen from aa by a tyrosyl radical centered
on tyr-385 in the rate-determining step to generate an arachidonyl radical (25–27). two molecules of o2 are then sequentially added to the arachidonyl radical to form the bicyclic
hydroperoxide prostaglandin g2 (pgg2). this intermediate diffuses to the peroxidase active site where the 15-hydroperoxyl
group undergoes a two-electron reduction to the alcohol prostaglandin h2. although the peroxidase activity can function
independently of the cyclooxygenase activity (28), activation of
the cyclooxygenase requires a functional peroxidase (1, 2, 23).
aa is the preferred substrate for  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  (17).
both isoforms will, however, oxygenate a variety of n-3 and n-6
18 –22 carbon  xxxd2154xxx  albeit with reduced catalytic efficiencies (17, 29 –36). most of these alternative fatty acid substrates
have somewhat higher km values than aa, but they can compete with aa for binding to the cyclooxygenase active site and
thereby inhibit formation of the 2-series prostaglandins that

prostaglandin endoperoxide h synthases-1 and -2
(pghss) can oxygenate 18 –22 carbon polyunsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx , albeit with varying efficiencies. here we
report the crystal structures of  xxxd2318xxx 
(epa, 20:5 n-3) and linoleic acid (la, 18:2 n-6) bound in
the cyclooxygenase active site of co3ⴙ protoporphyrin
ix-reconstituted ovine  xxxg1883xxx  (co3ⴙ-opghs-1) and
compare the effects of active site substitutions on the
rates of oxygenation of epa, la, and  xxxd208xxx 
(aa). both epa and la bind in the active site with
orientations similar to those seen previously with aa
and dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1887xxx ). for epa, the presence of an additional double bond (c-17/c-18) causes this
substrate to bind in a “strained” conformation in which
c-13 is misaligned with respect to tyr-385, the residue
that abstracts hydrogen from substrate  xxxd2154xxx . presumably, this misalignment is responsible for the low
rate of epa oxygenation. for la, the carboxyl half binds
in a more extended configuration than aa, which results
in positioning c-11 next to tyr-385. val-349 and ser-530,
recently identified as important determinants for efficient oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  by  xxxg1883xxx , play similar
roles in the oxygenation of epa and la. approximately
750- and 175-fold reductions in the oxygenation efficiency of epa and la were observed with v349a
opghs-1, compared with a 2-fold change for aa. val-349
contacts c-2 and c-3 of epa and c-4 of la orienting the
carboxyl halves of these substrates so that the ␻-ends
are aligned properly for hydrogen abstraction. an s530t
substitution decreases the vmax/km of epa and la by
375- and 140-fold. ser-530 makes six contacts with epa
and four with la involving c-8 through c-16; these interactions influence the alignment of the substrate for
hydrogen abstraction. interestingly, replacement of

experimental procedures

materials— xxxd2154xxx  were purchased from cayman chemical co.
(ann arbor, mi). [1-14c]aa (40 – 60 mci/mmol), [1-14c]epa (50 – 60
mci/mmol), and [1-14c]la (50 – 60 mci/mmol) were obtained from
perkinelmer life sciences. restriction enzymes and dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium were purchased from life technologies, inc.. calf
serum and fetal bovine serum were from hyclone laboratory (logan,
ut).  xxxd2141xxx  was obtained from sigma. primary antibodies used
for western blotting were raised in rabbits against purified opghs-1
and hpghs-2 and purified as igg fractions (48). goat anti-rabbit igg
horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from bio-rad. oligonucleotides used as primers for mutagenesis were prepared by the
michigan state university macromolecular structure, synthesis, and
sequencing facility. all other reagents were obtained from common
commercial sources.
preparation of opghs-1 mutants—mutants were prepared by sitedirected mutagenesis of opghs-1 in the psvt7 vector employing the
stratagene quickchange mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol. oligonucleotides used in the preparation of various mutants
were reported previously (24, 35, 49). plasmids used for transfections
were purified by cscl gradient ultracentrifugation, and mutations were
reconfirmed by double-stranded sequencing of the psvt7 constructs
using sequenase version 2.0 (u. s. biochemical corp.) and the protocol
described by the manufacturer.
transfection of cos-1 cells with opghs-1 constructs—cos-1 cells
(attc crl-1650) were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal bovine serum and transfected
with psvt7 plasmid constructs containing cdnas encoding native or
mutant enzymes using the deae-dextran/chloroquine transfection
method (35, 49). forty hours following transfection, cells were harvested and microsomal membrane fractions were prepared as described
previously (35, 49). protein concentrations were determined using the
method of bradford (50) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  used as the standard. microsomal preparations were used for western blotting and for
cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays. all mutant enzymes described
were expressed at protein levels similar to those of native enzymes and
retained ⱖ50% the peroxidase activity of native opghs-1 (49).
cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays—cyclooxygenase assays were

performed at 37 °c by monitoring the initial rate of o2 uptake using an
oxygen electrode (49). reactions were initiated by adding ⬃250 ␮g of
microsomal protein in a volume of 20 –50 ␮l to the assay chamber. the
oxygenation of all  xxxd2154xxx  by opghs-1 enzyme was completely
inhibited by the addition of 0.2 mm  xxxd2141xxx  to the reaction mixture.
the addition of an exogenous peroxide, 15s-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15s-hpete; 5 ␮m), to the reaction mixture was
necessary to sustain cyclooxygenase activity with epa (51). addition of
this peroxide to the reaction mixture had no effect on the conversion
rates of other substrates. all data were normalized to the relative levels
of pghs protein expression as determined by western blotting and
densitometry. fatty acid substrate concentrations of 100 ␮m were used
to estimate the maximal rates. km values were measured using concentrations of fatty acid substrates between 0.5 and 500 ␮m as described
previously (49). peroxidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically with n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetramethylphenylenediamine as the reducing cosubstrate (52) as reported previously (53). reactions were initiated by adding 100 ␮l of 0.3 mm h2o2, and the absorbance at 610 nm
was monitored with time.
western blot analysis—microsomal samples (⬃5 ␮g of protein) were
resolved by one-dimensional sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes using a
hoefer scientific semidry transfer apparatus. membranes were blocked
for 12 h in 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% tween 20, and tris-buffered saline,
followed by a 2-h incubation with a peptide-directed antibody against
opghs-1 (48, 54) in 1% dry milk, 0.1% tween 20, and tris-buffered
saline at room temperature. membranes were washed and incubated
for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit igg-horseradish
peroxidase, after which they were incubated with amersham pharmacia biotech ecl reagents and exposed to film for chemiluminescence.
characterization of fatty acid oxygenation products—a general protocol for product analysis is as follows. forty hours following transfection, cos-1 cells were collected, sonicated, and resuspended in 0.1 m
tris-hcl, ph 7.5. aliquots of the cell suspension (100 –250 ␮g of protein)
were incubated for 1–10 min at 37 °c in 0.1 m tris-hcl containing 1 mm
phenol and 6.8 ␮g of bovine hemoglobin in a total volume of 200 ␮l.
reactions were initiated by adding 1-14c-labeled fatty acid (35 ␮m final
concentration) and were performed in the presence and absence of 200
␮m  xxxd2141xxx  and stopped by adding 1.4 ml of chcl3:meoh (1:1 v/v).
insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 0.6 ml of
chcl3 and 0.32 ml of 0.88%  xxxd2154xxx  were added to the resulting
supernatant. the organic phase was collected, dried under n2, redissolved in 50 ␮l of chcl3, and spotted on a silica gel 60 thin layer
chromatography plate; the lipid products were chromatographed for 1 h
in benzene:dioxane: xxxd2154xxx :acetic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v/v/v). products
were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. negative control values from samples incubated with 200
␮m  xxxd2141xxx  were subtracted from the experimental values observed
for each sample in the absence of  xxxd2141xxx .
preparation of 15s-hpete—15s-hpete was prepared according to
graff (55) with modifications.  xxxd208xxx  (50 ␮mol) was suspended in 100 ml of 0.2 m borate buffer, ph 9.0. the reaction was
initiated by adding soybean lipoxygenase (50 mg) and the incubation
continued for 5 min at 30 °c. the reaction was quenched by adding
enough 0.24 m hcl to bring the ph to 3.0 (⬃20 ml) and extracted three
times with an equal volume of ice-cold petroleum ether:ethyl acetate
(1:1). extracts were pooled, dried under a nitrogen stream, and resuspended in 1ml of ethanol. the concentration of 15-hpete was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring cis-trans conjugated double bond formation (⑀234 ⫽ 3 ⫻ 104 mm⫺1/cm⫺1) and by measuring
peroxide levels using a ferrous sulfate-xylenol orange reagent as described by gupta (56).
purification and crystallization—apo-opghs-1 was purified and
reconstituted with co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  as described previously (57).
the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa and co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la complexes were formed
by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of epa or la prior to crystallization. crystals were grown in sitting-drops by combining either the
co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa complex or co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la complex with 0.64 m
sodium citrate, 0.3– 0.6 m licl, 1 mm nan3, 0.33% (w/v) n-octyl-␤-dglucopyranoside (␤-og), ph 6.5, and equilibrating over reservoir solutions containing 0.64 – 0.84 m sodium citrate, 0.3– 0.6 m licl, and 1 mm
nan3 at 20 °c. the crystals were harvested and transferred into 0.9 m
sodium citrate, ph 6.5, 1.0 m licl, 0.15% (w/v) ␤-og, followed by a
single-step transfer into the above buffer with 24% (w/v) sucrose added
as a cryoprotectant. the crystals were then immediately frozen in liquid
propane at ⫺165 °c.
data collection—both the co3⫹ -opghs-1䡠epa and co3⫹-opghs1䡠la complexes were collected at ⫺165 °c on beamline 19-id of the

are derived from aa (37– 40). linoleic acid (la; 18 –2 n-6) and
 xxxd2318xxx  (epa; 20:5 n-3) are oxygenated via the
cyclooxygenase activity of pghss by intact cells both in vitro
and in vivo (41– 47). oxygenation of la produces the monohydroxy acid products  xxxd598xxx  and  xxxd1367xxx . the biological function of these hydroxy acids has not been established. in contrast, epa, an n-3
essential fatty acid found in relative abundance in fish oil,
appears to provide some protection from coronary thrombosis.
epa, like aa, is stored at the sn-2 position of phosphoglycerides and like aa can be released upon activation of phospholipases a2 (1, 17, 38, 45, 47). for example, in circulating platelets epa can be converted to the prostanoid pgh3, which, in
turn, can be isomerized to thromboxane a3 and pgd3 (1, 7, 38).
however, epa is both a poor substrate for platelet  xxxg1883xxx  and
a potent competitive inhibitor of aa oxygenation by platelet
 xxxg1883xxx  (1, 17, 38). thus, the net effect of increased dietary
intake of fish oil is to reduce the production of pro-thombogenic
thromboxane from aa.  xxxd234xxx  is commonly used to
inhibit the platelet  xxxg1883xxx . however, understanding how epa
fits into the cyclooxygenase active site of  xxxg1883xxx  and competes
with aa for binding to this site could lead to the development
of more selective anti-thrombogenic agents.
x-ray crystallography and mutational analyses have identified val-349 and ser-530 in  xxxg1883xxx  as key determinants of
specificity for the alternative fatty acid substrate dihomo-␥ xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1887xxx ; 20:3 ␻-6) (24). here, we extend these
findings with additional studies of the cyclooxygenase active
site of opghs-1 that were designed (a) to determine how two
other alternative fatty acid substrates, epa and la, bind
within the cyclooxygenase active site and (b) to identify active
site residues that influence the ability of  xxxg1883xxx  to use epa
and la as substrates.

results and discussion

epa and la bound in the cyclooxygenase channel—we
have determined the crystal structure complexes of epa and
la bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of the co3⫹-opghs-1
(57) at 3.1- and 2.9-å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. the r.m.s. deviation between the structures of
co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa and co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la versus co3⫹opghs-1䡠aa (15) are 0.20 å (551 out of 554 c␣ atoms) and 0.16
å (553 out of 554 c␣ atoms), respectively, indicating that the
 xxxg681xxx , membrane binding domain, and catalytic domains are resolvable and virtually unchanged with
respect to fatty acid binding in the cyclooxygenase active site
(15, 24). in addition, both epa and la complexes with co3⫹opghs-1 reveal interpretable electron density for the co3⫹ xxxd3037xxx , the carbohydrate moieties linked to asn-68,
asn-144, and asn-410, and ␤-og detergent molecules bound
within the membrane binding domain (data not shown).
both epa and la bind in the cyclooxygenase active site in a
configuration generally similar to that observed for aa (15) and
 xxxd1887xxx  (24). the “l-shaped” configuration positions the carboxylate near the side chain of arg-120 and tyr-355 at the opening
of the channel (figs. 1 and 2). the negative charge of the
carboxylate is stabilized via a salt bridge with the guanidinium
group of arg-120 (fig. 3), a required binding determinant of
substrates for  xxxg1883xxx  (15, 24, 49, 63) and for oxygenation of
epa by  xxxg1884xxx  (35). in addition, two hydrogen bonds, one
each to the phenolic oxygen of tyr-355 and the guanidinium
group of arg-120, further stabilize the carboxylate in an other-

structural biology center (advanced photon source, argonne, il) at a
wavelength of 1.03321å. each data set was processed and scaled using
hkl2000 (58) and scalepack (58). details of the data collection and
reduction are summarized in table i.
structural solution and refinement—crystals of co3⫹-opghs1䡠epa and co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la are isomorphous with those of co3⫹opghs-1 complexed with aa (15, 57). therefore, all ligands, detergent,
and carbohydrate molecules were removed from the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠aa
complex (protein data bank entry 1diy) and the protein portion (residues 32–584) was used as the starting model. for the co3⫹-opghs1䡠epa complex, refinement was carried out using cns version 0.9a
(59), employing the maximum likelihood target using amplitudes, a
bulk solvent correction, and an overall b factor correction, utilizing 2␴
data from 20.0 to 3.1 å. initial rigid-body refinement, followed by cycles
of positional and group b factor refinement (main chain/side chain)
resulted in initial r and free r values of 24.4 and 31.2%, respectively.
the 2fo ⫺ fc and fo ⫺ fc electron density maps calculated at this stage
of the refinement clearly showed the position for co3⫹-protoporphyrin
ix and 9 carbohydrate residues. these features are readily observable
in both the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠aa (15) and co3⫹-opghs-1䡠dhla (24) complexes and have not been included initially to provide a good check of
data quality. in addition, strong electron density was observed for epa
bound in the cyclooxygenase channel as well as for 2 ␤-og detergent
molecules and the glucoside head group of another within the membrane binding domain. these molecules were built into their corresponding electron density, followed by cycles of positional refinement,
group b factor refinement, and model inspection. a total of 56 water
molecules were then added at positions that were within 2.4 –3.6 å of a
hydrogen bond donor or acceptor and had electron density peaks greater
than 2.5␴ in fo ⫺ fc maps. the final model has r and free r values of
23.0 and 29.6%, respectively (table i). refinement of the co3⫹-opghs1䡠la complex was carried out in an identical manner to that of the
co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa complex, utilizing 2␴ data from 15 to 2.9 å. initial
rigid-body, positional, and group b factor refinement resulted in r and
free r values of 25.5 and 29.2% with strong electron density for co3⫹ xxxd3037xxx , 9 carbohydrate residues, and la bound in the cyclooxygenase channel. additionally, 2 ␤-og detergent molecules and
the glucoside head group of another were visible in the region surrounding the membrane binding domain. these molecules were modeled into
their corresponding electron density along with 84 water molecules,
with alternating cycles of positional refinement, group b factor refinement, and model inspection. the final model has r and free r values of
23.5 and 27.1%, respectively (table i). both fatty acid complexes were
evaluated by procheck (60). all residues lie within the most favored
or allowed regions of the ramachandran plot, whereas the additional
geometrical parameters are well within the bounds established from
well refined structures at equivalent resolution. the mean positional
errors in the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa and co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la complexes are
0.40 and 0.41 å, respectively (table i).
as a test of the quality of the medium resolution diffraction data and
to verify that the differences observed between the epa, la, and aa
were significant, we calculated fo ⫺ fc difference electron density maps
using the observed structure factors from either the co3⫹-opghs1䡠epa or co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la complex but with the phases calculated
from the refined co3⫹-opghs-1 protein model and the refined model of
aa from the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠aa crystal structure (15) placed in the
cyclooxygenase active site. in the areas where the position of the carbons differ between the substrates, we would expect to observe the
appropriate “positive” and “negative” difference density peaks in the
calculated fo ⫺ fc electron density maps. this method was successfully
employed to verify differences observed between  xxxd1887xxx  and aa bound
in the cyclooxygenase active site (24). analysis of the maps calculated
with the structure factors from co3⫹-opghs-1䡠epa contoured at 3␴
clearly showed two positive peaks corresponding to the correct location
for c-8 and c-9 and c-11 and c-12 (data not shown); two regions in epa
whose positions show the largest deviations from aa. in addition,
appropriate negative difference peaks corresponding to misplacement
of the above carbons and c-18 through c-20 were also observed. similarly, maps calculated with the structure factors from co3⫹-opghs1䡠la contoured at 3␴ showed a positive peak corresponding to c-6
through c-9 and a negative peak centered over c-8 through c-10 of aa:
the region of largest deviation between la and aa. therefore, we can
conclude that the modeled positions of epa and la in the cyclooxygenase active site do in fact differ from the position previously determined
for aa, given the resolution of the data. furthermore, no alternate
models could be built for epa or la given the geometrical and stereochemical constraints of the substrate.

wise predominantly hydrophobic channel (fig. 3). the ␻-end of
the  xxxd2154xxx  bind in a hydrophobic groove above helix 17
(residues 520 –535) between ser-530 and gly-533 (figs. 1 and
2). this is accomplished through the weaving of the central
part of the carbon chain of each substrate around the side chain
of ser-530, the residue that can be acetylated by aspirin, resulting in the positioning of c-13 (c-11 in la) below tyr-385 for
hydrogen abstraction (figs. 1 and 2). epa and la make a total
of 61 and 47 contacts, respectively, with 20 residues that line
the cyclooxygenase active site (fig. 3). of these, only the salt
link and hydrogen bonds formed between the carboxylate, arg120, and tyr-355 are hydrophilic. these 20 residues are conserved with respect to the residues shown to be involved in
binding aa and  xxxd1887xxx  to opghs-1 (15, 24, 49).
comparison of epa, la, and aa binding in the cyclooxygenase active site—although epa binds in a manner similar to
aa, the additional c-17/c-18 double bond at the ␻-end decreases the flexibility of this fatty acid substrate in the cyclooxygenase active site resulting in a strained binding orientation. whereas c-1 is positioned to make the required
carboxylate interaction with arg-120, the rest of the carbon
chain is compacted and displaced with respect to the carbon
positions in aa (r.m.s. deviation ⫽ 1.59 å; fig. 4). c-2 through
c-10 now pack more closely to helix 17 (residues 520 –535),
resulting in 24 contacts with active site residues versus 13 for
the same carbons in aa (figs. 3a and 4) (15). displacement of
these carbons is required to accommodate the conformationally
inflexible ␻-end of epa in the hydrophobic groove above ser-

530 (fig. 4). a major consequence of this binding arrangement
is the misalignment of c-13 below tyr-385. the position of c-13
in epa differs by 1.4 å with respect to c-13 of aa (fig. 4a).
furthermore, modeling of the pro-s hydrogen onto c-13 of epa
places it 4.1 å away from the phenolic oxygen of tyr-385 and
rotated toward the hydroxyl group of ser-530 (fig. 4b). conversely, the 13-pro-s hydrogen modeled onto aa lies directly
below tyr-385, 2.7 å away from the phenolic oxygen (15).
despite being two carbons shorter and containing two fewer
double bonds, la binds in the cyclooxygenase active site in a
conformation very similar to that observed for aa (fig. 5). the
carboxyl half of la binds such that c-1 interacts with arg-120,
while c-2 through c-7 contact val-349, leu-352, ile-523, gly526, and ala-527 (fig. 3b); these contacts are all comparable to
those seen with aa (15). this is further evidenced by the r.m.s.
deviation of 0.67 å calculated between carbon positions (c-1
through c-7 only) in la versus aa. starting with c-7, the chain
takes a more direct route to the apex of the active site to
position c-11, analogous to c-13 in aa, below tyr-385 (fig. 5);
overall, this is a consequence of shortening of the fatty acid
substrate chain by two carbons. in contrast, the c-8/c-9 double
bond of aa protrudes toward helix 17, where it makes four
hydrophobic contacts with gly-526 before weaving around the
side chain of ser-530 (15). thus, la does not contain the
“s-shaped” kink that is a structural characteristic observed for
binding 20 carbon fatty acid substrates to the cyclooxygenase
active site (15, 24). despite the lack of an s-shaped kink in the
substrate chain, c-11 is positioned “optimally” below tyr-385
for hydrogen abstraction and the ␻-end of la is oriented properly in the hydrophobic groove above ser-530 (fig. 5). the pro-s

hydrogen of la lies 3.0å below the phenolic oxygen of tyr-385
in an orientation similar to that seen for the 13-pro-s hydrogen
of aa (2.7 å) (15) (fig. 5). c-9 through c-18 in la are chemically equivalent to c-11 through c-20 in aa, including the
location of the double bonds within this segment. therefore, it
is not surprising that these carbons are in correspondingly
similar positions (r.m.s. deviation of 0.70 å) and the contacts
made with residues lining the hydrophobic groove are conserved (figs. 3b and 5) (15).
oxygenation of epa and la by active site mutants—to
further define the structural basis for the substrate specificities of the cyclooxygenase activity of  xxxg1883xxx , we compared
how active site substitutions of groups that contact the substrate affect the rates of oxygenation of epa, la, and aa.
replacements of val-349, ser-530, and leu-534 produced relatively dramatic decreases in the oxygenation efficiencies of
epa and/or la compared with those seen with aa (tables ii
and iii). in addition, replacement of phe-205 with leucine
yielded a mutant enzyme that oxygenates epa better than la,
aa (49), or  xxxd1887xxx  (24) when compared with the oxygenation of
these substrates by the native enzyme (table iii). all other
active site substitutions caused approximately parallel decreases in the rate of oxygenation of epa and la when compared with the rates of oxygenation of aa (table iii). the
kinetic properties displayed by these mutants are discussed in

detail below, and their functions as a determinants of substrate
specificity are rationalized based on the crystal structures of
aa, epa, and la bound in the cyclooxygenase active site of
co3⫹-opghs-1.
valine 349 —previous studies have shown that mutation of
val-349 to alanine reduces the rate of oxygenation of aa to 55%
that of native  xxxg1883xxx , with no significant effect on the km
value (24, 49). we have extended these studies to show that the
v349a substitution dramatically reduces the rates of oxygenation of la and epa to 0.1% that of native opghs-1, with
corresponding increases in km values between 10- and 100-fold.
as a result, there are 175- and 750-fold reductions in the
oxygenation efficiencies for la and epa, respectively (table
ii), compared with less than 2-fold for aa (49). a significant
reduction is also observed for the oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  by
v349a opghs-1, where there is an 833-fold difference in the
vmax/km value compared with native enzyme (24). replacement of val-349 with leucine produces a similar reduction in
the oxygenation efficiency. a v349l mutation reduces the catalytic efficiency toward aa less than 6-fold, but there are
reductions in the vmax/km value toward la and epa of 350and 750-fold, respectively (table ii). however, unlike with the
v349a substitution, the reduced efficiency is due mostly to
large increases in the km values for epa (246-fold) and la
(53-fold) (table ii). there is only a modest reduction in the

production of pgg2 (49, 53). replacement of val-349 with alanine yields a mutant enzyme that produces 55% 11-hpete
from aa, compared with the formation of only 2.5% 11-hpete
by native opghs-1. the v349l substitution shifts the product
profile toward the production of 15-hpete (⬃20% of the total
products) (49, 53). conversely, analysis of the products formed
from the oxygenation of [1-14c]epa and [1-14c]la by v349a
and v349l opghs-1 indicates that the ratios of oxygenated
products produced are the same with respect to native
opghs-1 (data not shown). similarly, product analysis of
[1-14c] xxxd1887xxx  upon oxygenation by v349a and v349l opghs-1
again showed that the relative ratio was similar to native
opghs-1, with only a less than 2-fold increase in monohydroxy
acid formation (24). thus, val-349 clearly plays a critical role in
the positioning of alternative fatty acid substrates for oxygenation, but mutations at this site do not change the distribution
of products.
based on inspection of the structures of aa, epa, and la
bound in the cyclooxygenase active site of opghs-1, one can
rationalize why val-349 is more important for the efficient
oxygenation of epa and la (figs. 4 and 5). val-349 is located
in helix 6 (residues 325–353; ref. 12), which forms one wall of
the cyclooxygenase active site (figs. 4 and 5). the side chain of
val-349 extends into the channel and serves as a structural
bumper that positions the carboxyl half of the fatty acid. the
c␥1 atom of val-349 contacts c-3 and c-4 of aa to favor
production of pgg2 (15, 49), and c-5 of  xxxd1887xxx  to orient the
13-pro-s hydrogen for abstraction by tyr-385 (24). consistent
with aa and  xxxd1887xxx , the contacts within this area of the substrate chain are conserved for epa and la bound in the active
site, where the c␥1 atom of val-349 makes two contacts with
epa (c-2 and c-3) and one contact with la (c-4) (fig. 3).
computer modeling indicates that replacement of val-349
with an alanine creates a large pocket into which the carboxyl
half of substrates can move (24, 49, 53). since the carbon chain
of epa is more compacted toward the carboxyl end of the
substrate in order to accommodate the c-17/c-18 double bond
in the hydrophobic channel above helix 17 (fig. 4), the larger
opening created by the v349a mutation would allow the substrate to move into the vacated space as a rigid body. as a
result, c-13 would be further displaced from tyr-385 reducing
even more the chance for hydrogen abstraction and subsequent
product formation (table ii). furthermore, because the c-1
through c-10 region of epa makes twice as many contacts as
aa with residues ile-523, gly-526, and ala-527 on the wall
opposite val-349 (16 versus 8; fig. 3a), movement away from
helix 17 would serve to destabilize the binding of epa within
the active site (table ii). as la is more flexible within its
carboxyl half of the substrate chain due to a lack of unsaturated
bonds, movement into the space vacated by the valine side
chain would likely occur with the v349a mutant. the major
consequence of this movement would be the altered positioning
of c-11 with respect to tyr-385 (table ii). moreover, because
c-1 through c-8 of la are stabilized predominantly by contacts
with ile-523, gly-526, and ala-527 (fig. 3b), movement away
from these residues would destabilize la binding in the active
site (table ii).
computer modeling of the v349l mutation shows a constricting of the size of the cyclooxygenase active site near the
base of the channel. this reduction in size moderately affects
the binding and oxygenation of aa and  xxxd1887xxx , as v349l
opghs-1 retains relatively similar activities with both substrates, whereas v349a opghs-1 is much less active toward
 xxxd1887xxx  (24). conversely, the binding of epa and la are dramatically affected by the v349l substitution (table ii). the
binding of epa would be significantly altered with a reduction

kinetic properties for oxygenation of aa, epa, and la by native and mutant opghs-1
oxygenase activity was measured with aa, epa, or la as the substrate using an oxygen electrode as described under “experimental
procedures.” vmax values are values for fatty acid turnover and were obtained from measurements of rates of o2 uptake and then corrected for the
percentage of mono- and bis-oxygenated products formed with the different enzymes and substrates. a vmax value of 100% is assigned for oxygenase
activity of native opghs-1 with aa. vmax and km values represent the mean values from a minimum of four separate determinations with standard
deviations within 10% of all values reported. relative vmax values reported for mutant enzymes for which km values were not determined represent

of space near the carboxyl half of the molecule. the substrate
would not be able to negotiate the presence of an additional
carbon atom due to its already rigid configuration and compromised binding orientation in the active site. despite the increased flexibility of la compared with aa and epa, the binding of la is also affected substantially by the reduced size of
the active site. upon inspection, it would seem that the binding
of la would be unaffected by the v349l substitution and in
fact more stabilized by the additional contacts that could be
formed with the carboxyl half of this substrate. however, the
leucine substitution must perturb c-2 through c-6 such that
the substrate cannot extend properly so as to assume an orientation suitable for hydrogen abstraction (table ii).
ile-523 lies across from val-349 on the opposite side of the
active site channel and interacts with the same region of the
substrate chain (figs. 3–5). the c␥1 atom of ile-523 makes

three contacts with epa (c-4, c-5, and c-6) and two contacts
with la (c-3 and c-5) (fig. 3). replacement of ile-523 with an
alanine has no effect on the rate of oxygenation of epa, presumably due to the compensatory interactions made with leu352, ser-353, gly-526, and ala-527 (fig. 3a) and in agreement
with results reported previously for aa and  xxxd1887xxx  (24, 49).
however, the rate of oxygenation of la is altered significantly
with an i523a mutation (table iii). removal of the c␥1 atom
would destabilize the binding of the carboxyl half of la, somewhat similar to what occurs with the v349a substitution. unlike epa, la is more extended in this region resulting in fewer
compensatory contacts; there are seven fewer contacts with
leu-352, gly-526, and ala-527, and la does not contact the
side chain of ser-353 (figs. 3b and 5).
serine 530 —the hydroxyl group of ser-530 is the site of
acetylation of opghs-1 by aspirin (64, 65). previous mutational analyses of ser-530, utilizing aa as the substrate, have
shown the following: (a) replacement of ser-530 with alanine
has relatively little effect on the oxygenation of aa (64, 66), (b)
replacement of ser-530 with threonine causes a 38-fold decrease in vmax/km (66), and (c) replacement of ser-530 with
either leucine or asparagine prevents cyclooxygenase catalysis
by blocking substrate access to tyr-385 at the top of the active
site channel (66).
analysis of the product profiles with aa have shown that an
abundance of 15-hete is produced from aa by s530t
opghs-1 relative to native enzyme, whereas s530a opghs-1
produces product ratios similar to that of native opghs-1 (49).
replacements at ser-530 have a greater effect on the oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  than aa; although the vmax/km for  xxxd1887xxx  is
only decreased slightly with the s530a mutant due to a 4-fold
increase in km, there is more than an 800-fold decrease with
the s530t mutant (24).
s530a and s530t substitutions also influence the efficiency
of oxygenation of epa and la by opghs-1. replacement of
ser-530 with alanine decreases the vmax/km toward la by
4.4-fold and epa by 24-fold (table ii). the magnitude of
change in oxygenation efficiency is greater than that observed
for the oxygenation of aa by s530a (table ii) (49); however,
unlike aa, the change is primarily due to the 2.5- and 24-fold
increases in km for la and epa, respectively (table ii). although replacement of ser-530 with threonine results in an
enzyme that is relatively inactive toward all fatty acid substrates (table ii) (24, 49), there are greater than 7-fold increases in km for epa and la versus aa. as mentioned above,
s530t opghs-1 produces an abundance of 15-hete compared
with the native enzyme when aa is used as the substrate. the
relative proportions of oxygenated products formed upon incubation of [1-14c]epa and [1-14c]la with s530t opghs-1 are
similar to those observed with native opghs-1 (data not

the side chain of leu-534 makes only one van der waals
contact with c-16 of la in the co3⫹-opghs-1䡠la crystal structure (fig. 3b). this contact is the sole contact made between
the floor of the hydrophobic groove within the last four carbons
(c-15 through c-18) of la (figs. 3b and 5). a l534v replacement would slightly open up the floor of the hydrophobic pocket
such that the ␻-end of la could move into this area causing
c-11 to be displaced such that hydrogen abstraction by tyr-385
cannot occur. a l534a mutation further opens the hole in the
floor, but unlike the valine mutation, la and ␣- xxxd2490xxx 
are oxygenated (table iii).2 with a larger space now in the
floor, the ␻-end of la would have more flexibility to assume a
compensatory orientation that allows c-11 to be placed below
tyr-385 for hydrogen abstraction and subsequent oxygenation.
phenylalanine 205—the aromatic cluster of phe-205, phe209, and phe-381 comprises the “ceiling” of the hydrophobic
groove above helix 17 (figs. 4b and 5b) (15). various phenyl
ring carbons of these residues lie within van der waals distance
of c-14 through c-20 of aa. these contacts serve to stabilize
the ␻-end within the groove and collectively contribute to maintaining optimal alignment of c-13 below tyr-385 for hydrogen
abstraction (49). c-17 through c-19 of epa and c-14 through
c-17 of la are also involved in stabilizing contacts with the
side chain carbons of phe-205, phe-209, and phe-381 (fig. 3).
mutation of phe-209 and phe-381 to leucine or alanine results
in a parallel reduction in the oxygenation rate for aa, epa, and
la when compared with the ability of native opghs-1 to
oxygenate these substrates (table iii). interestingly, replacement of phe-205 with leucine results in a mutant enzyme with
a higher vmax than the native enzyme with epa (table iii); in
contrast, when aa and la are utilized as substrates, the rates
of oxygenation are reduced similarly to levels observed for
phe-209 and phe-381 replacements (table iii). when phe-205
is replaced by an alanine, a reduction in the rate of oxygenation
is observed for aa, epa, and la.
unlike phe-209 and phe-381, the side chain of phe-205 interacts with fatty acid substrates in an “edge-on” fashion (figs.
1 and 4) (15, 24). there are two van der waals contacts between
the side chain of phe-205 and c-19 of epa (fig. 3a). computer
modeling of the f205l substitution indicates that the space in
the active site above c-18 through c-20 would be enlarged. the
additional room could be utilized by epa if the c-17/c-18
double bond is reoriented via rotation about c-16. as a consequence, the conformation of the ␻-end would be aligned such
that c-13 is positioned somewhat more optimally below tyr385. despite the loss of three side chain carbons, a leucine at
position 205 should be able to maintain the stabilizing contacts
with c-18 through c-20 of epa in the new orientation.
the leucine and alanine substitutions made at phe-209 and
phe-381 cause similar reductions in oxygenation rates for epa,
la, and aa (table iii). the side chain of phe-209 lies above
gly-533 at the end of the hydrophobic groove and makes only
one contact with c-19 of epa (figs. 3 and 4). conversely, the
side chain of phe-381 is located adjacent to tyr-385, where it
makes three contacts with the c-17/c-18 double bond of epa
(figs. 3 and 4). based on the conformation of the phenolic side
chains of phe-209 and phe-381 relative to the substrate, the
additional space gained through the leucine substitution would
not be sufficient to allow epa the conformational freedom to
reorient its ␻-end such that c-13 is optimally positioned below
tyr-385. in contrast, replacements at phe-205, phe-209, and
phe-381 with alanine would create too large of an opening
within the hydrophobic groove resulting in destabilization of
the ␻-end and misalignment of c-13 for hydrogen abstraction
(table iii).

shown). thus, unlike the case with aa, replacement of ser-530
with either alanine or threonine has a greater effect on the
oxygenation efficiencies of epa and la than on the product
profile. these results from mutagenesis suggest that the ser530 side chain plays a key role in positioning epa and la for
hydrogen abstraction by tyr-385.
analysis of the interactions made between aa and cyclooxygenase active site residues shows that ser-530 makes three van
der waals contacts with aa involving c-10 and c-16 of the
substrate (15). the midsection of aa weaves around the side
chain of ser-530 such that c-13 lies below tyr-385 for hydrogen
abstraction; similarly, c-13 lies above the hydroxyl group of
ser-530. the hydroxyl group is not required for cyclooxygenase
catalysis (table ii) (49, 64, 66). there are seven contacts made
between ser-530 and epa involving c-10, c-12, c-13, c-16,
c-17, and c-18 (fig. 3a). like aa, epa threads around the side
chain of ser-530 positioning c-13 of epa below tyr-385. however, in accommodating the additional n-3 double bond of epa
in the hydrophobic pocket, the midsection of epa is compacted
and displaced toward the side chain of ser-530 (fig. 4). replacement of ser-530 with alanine widens the area below tyr385, allowing c-10 through c-16 of epa more freedom to rotate
for optimal positioning of c-13 for hydrogen abstraction. indeed, there is virtually no change in the vmax of s530a when
compared with the oxygenation of epa by native opghs-1
(table ii). in contrast, replacement of ser-530 with the larger
threonine further restricts the width of the channel between
thr-530 and tyr-385, and thus the movement of epa so that
c-13 of epa is misaligned for hydrogen abstraction. as a consequence, the oxygenation efficiency of s530t opghs-1 toward
epa is decreased 375-fold compared with the native enzyme
due primarily to a 58-fold increase in km (table ii).
c-8, c-11, and c-14 of la make four contacts with ser-530
(fig. 3b). la takes a more direct route to the top of the cyclooxygenase active site due to its shorter chain length (fig. 5).
as a result, the fatty acid chain does not form the s-shaped
kink seen with 20 carbon cyclooxygenase substrates. the widening of the area below tyr-385 in the s530a mutation has
little effect on the oxygenation of la, causing only a 2-fold
reduction in vmax/km (table ii). as the substrate chain is
extended to place c-11 below tyr-385, there is less of a requirement for stabilizing contacts between ser-530 and the midsection of la. as with epa, replacement of ser-530 with threonine
restricts optimal positioning of c-11 for hydrogen abstraction
by reducing the space below tyr-385. consequently, the km for
la binding increases 48-fold, resulting in a 140-fold decrease in
oxygenation efficiency of la with s530t opghs-1 compared
with native enzyme (table ii).
leucine 534 —the sidechains of ser-530 and leu-534 constitute the “floor” for the hydrophobic side pocket and make stabilizing contacts with the ␻-end of fatty acid substrates (figs. 3,
4a, and 5a) (15, 49). moreover, leu-534 plays a key role in
positioning aa in a conformation such that upon hydrogen
abstraction, it is appropriately arranged to yield pgg2; replacement with either alanine or valine yields mutant enzymes
that produce large amounts of 15-hpete (49). a l534v mutant is unable to oxygenate la (table iii) or ␣- xxxd2490xxx 
(18:3 ␻-3),2 but retains activity toward 20 carbon fatty acid
substrates such as aa, epa (table iii), and  xxxd1887xxx  (24). in
contrast, replacement of leu-534 with alanine produces a mutant enzyme that is not greatly restricted in its ability to
oxygenate fatty acid substrates (table iii) (24, 49). similar
reductions in vmax are observed for the oxygenation of epa, la
(table iii), and  xxxd1887xxx  (24) compared with aa.

fatty acid/cyclooxygenase
strates for opghs-1 that are oxygenated at reduced rates compared with aa (table ii, table iii). both substrates bind
within the cyclooxygenase active site in an l-shaped conformation similar to that observed for aa. however, the structural
properties of epa and la cause each of these fatty acid substrates to bind in orientations that are suboptimal with respect
to hydrogen abstraction and subsequent cyclooxygenase catalysis. kinetic analyses of mutations of cyclooxygenase active site
residues that contact epa and la indicate that val-349, ser530, and leu-534 are particularly important for the efficient
oxygenation of these substrates. finally, replacement of phe205 with leucine increases the volume of the cyclooxygenase
active site, allowing epa to be oxygenated somewhat more
efficiently.
