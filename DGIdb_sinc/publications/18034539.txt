oral synthetic retinoids have been established as effective systemic therapy
for psoriasis since their introduction for clinical use in the 1970s; a compound
for topical use,  xxxd3297xxx  has been recently marketed. despite the demonstrated
clinical success of retinoid therapy in psoriasis, its mechanism of action has not
been fully elucidated, and investigators are confronted with two paradoxes. one
is that the binding of retinoids to nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) does not
match their therapeutic efficacy:  xxxd71xxx  activates the three receptor subtypes,
 xxxg1931xxx , -beta and -gamma, without measurable receptor binding, whereas  xxxd3297xxx  preferentially binds to and activates  xxxg1932xxx  and -gamma in preference to  xxxg1931xxx . the other
is that there is already increased formation of  xxxd3417xxx  in the psoriatic lesion.
answering these questions should result in better use of these drugs in the treatment of psoriasis.
oral administration of  xxxd71xxx  remains one of the first therapeutic choices for
severe psoriasis, particularly in association with ultraviolet light therapy, of which
it may decrease the carcinogenic risk. topical  xxxd3297xxx  is suitable for moderate
plaque psoriasis. its efficacy and tolerability can be enhanced by the addition of
topical corticosteroids; its irritative potential is counterbalanced by a sustained
therapeutic effect after the treatment is stopped.

1. retinoids for psoriasis: why?
retinoids used for the management of psoriasis
are synthetic analogues of  xxxd3417xxx , the natural
ligand of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars).
despite the demonstrated clinical efficacy of retinoid therapy in psoriasis, its mechanism of action has
not been fully established (reviewed by saurat[1]).
retinoids are said to exert their therapeutic effect
by modulating 3 major pathogenic features of psoriasis: disturbed keratinocyte differentiation, keratinocyte hyperproliferation and tissue infiltration
by inflammatory cells. the primary molecular target for these effects is  xxxd3237xxx . according
to current concepts of the pathogenesis of psoriasis,
t lymphocytes are thought to trigger the chain of
cellular and molecular events that induce the psoriasis phenotype; epidermal keratinocytes participate
in establishing the appropriate cytokine milieu.[2]
it has been suggested that epidermal hyperplasia
is driven by t lymphocytes and, parallel to hyperproliferation, resistance of keratinocytes to apoptosis also accounts for this hyperplasia.[2] the mechanism by which retinoids interfere with these events
is  xxxd3237xxx , and is thus hypothetical. retinoids may alter the cytokine production profile by t
lymphocytes, interfere with keratinocyte responsiveness to cytokines, or abolish the resistance of keratinocytes to apoptosis. answering these questions
and identifying the molecular pathways involved
should result in better use of these drugs in the treatment of psoriasis.
the discovery of nuclear rars was an important advance which may lead to a unifying theory
of retinoid action and provide the means to design
retinoids with specific properties for targeted use.
so far, the field is confronted by 2 paradoxes. one
is that  xxxd71xxx , the synthetic retinoid used for oral
treatment of psoriasis, activates all 3 nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptor subtypes ( xxxg1931xxx , -beta and -gamma) without measurable receptor binding (reviewed by
saurat[1]). the other is that there is already increased formation of  xxxd3417xxx  in the psoriatic lesion,[3] which may be triggered by interferon-gamma;[1]
therefore, additional loading with exogenous retinoids appears therapeutically unsound.

2. retinoids for psoriasis: which?
until recently, treatment of psoriasis with retinoids has been restricted to systemic administration;
however, a topical drug is now available.
three synthetic retinoids have been marketed
for oral use: the aromatic retinoid ester  xxxd2071xxx ,
the free-acid derivative of  xxxd2071xxx ,  xxxd71xxx , and
13-cis- xxxd3417xxx , isotretinoin.  xxxd2071xxx  and its
active metabolite,  xxxd71xxx , have an established role
in the treatment of psoriasis;  xxxd2071xxx  was first reported to be effective in psoriasis in 1975 and  xxxd71xxx  in 1984. isotretinoin has a less marked antipsoriatic effect.[4,5]
 xxxd3297xxx  is the first topical retinoid demonstrated to be both effective and tolerable in treating
plaque-type psoriasis.[6] this interesting development has renewed interest in the topical retinoid
treatment of psoriasis, after previous failures to treat
the disease with topical  xxxd3417xxx .
the choice between topical and oral treatment
is based on the severity and extent of the disease.
3. retinoids for psoriasis: how?
3.1  xxxd2071xxx  and  xxxd71xxx 
3.1.1 pharmacokinetics and their implications

 xxxd2071xxx  is an ethylester that undergoes extensive hydrolysis in the body to yield the corresponding acid metabolite. it appears from cellular and
molecular pharmacology studies that the pharmacologically active compound of  xxxd2071xxx  is  xxxd71xxx ,
and therefore  xxxd2071xxx  may be considered as a prodrug.[7] in animal models[7] and in clinical studies
in patients with severe keratinising disorders,[8]  xxxd71xxx  is equally effective compared with  xxxd2071xxx .
however,  xxxd71xxx  has a profound pharmacokinetic advantage because it is eliminated more rapidly than  xxxd2071xxx .[9]  xxxd2071xxx  is approximately
50 times more lipophilic than  xxxd71xxx  and binds
strongly to plasma proteins, particularly lipoproteins and albumin. this fact has a profound influence on the respective pharmacokinetic properties
of the 2 drugs.[9]
when  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx  is taken with a meal,
the absorption of the drug is increased 2- to 5-fold
biodrugs 2000 may; 13 (5)

retinoid drugs in management of psoriasis

and the amount absorbed is more consistent.[9,10] it
is therefore recommended that  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx 
be taken with the main meal of the day. however,
even when the drugs are taken with food, they are
absorbed to a variable extent. this leads to marked
interindividual variations in plasma retinoid concentrations, which appears not to depend upon bodyweight.[4]
the main adverse effect associated with synthetic retinoids is teratogenicity, and the length of
time that these drugs are present in the body is thus
of great interest.  xxxd2071xxx  is stored in adipose tissue, including subcutaneous fat, from which it is
released slowly. it thus has a long terminal elimination half-life of up to 120 days. in contrast, under
identical conditions,  xxxd71xxx  carries a negatively
charged group and, being so much less lipophilic
than  xxxd2071xxx , does not accumulate in adipose tissue and is therefore eliminated from the body more
rapidly.  xxxd71xxx  has an elimination half-life of 2
days.[11]
initial publication of data indicating that  xxxd2071xxx  can be formed in patients receiving  xxxd71xxx [12]
has been confirmed by several similar reports.[11,13]
this esterification seems to occur when  xxxd71xxx  is
taken simultaneously with alcohol.[13] this finding
prompted the manufacturer to extend the time of
compulsory contraception in patients taking  xxxd71xxx 
to 2 years, as it is for  xxxd2071xxx .[5] indeed, the us
food and drug administration (fda) recently approved the therapy contraceptive period of at least
3 years for  xxxd71xxx , based on the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd71xxx  and  xxxd2071xxx  in clinical trials and on
previous safety experience with  xxxd2071xxx . the pharmacokinetic advantages of  xxxd71xxx  over  xxxd2071xxx 
still hold true, however, for all women who strictly
avoid alcohol during treatment and for 2 months
thereafter.[11]
for all these reasons  xxxd71xxx  represents a therapeutic alternative with greater clinical potential
than  xxxd2071xxx ; in june 1997,  xxxd71xxx  was approved by the fda as a substitute for  xxxd2071xxx  for similar indications.[11]

3.1.2 therapeutic profile

several randomised multicentre trials have been
performed to ascertain the efficacy of  xxxd71xxx  on
plaque-type[14-18] and pustular psoriasis and to compare its efficacy with that of  xxxd2071xxx .[14]  xxxd71xxx 
appears to be as effective as  xxxd2071xxx [8] and can be
used in the same combination regimens.[19] adverse
effects appear to be similar in quality and incidence.
the best results have been obtained in palmoplantar or generalised (von zumbusch) type pustular psoriasis in which  xxxd2071xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  are
considered to be the treatments of first choice.[20,21]
both localised and generalised pustular psoriatic
lesions as well as those of erythrodermic psoriasis
are cleared more frequently with  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx  monotherapy than with most other therapies.[20-22]
rebound does not usually occur after stopping
 xxxd71xxx  or  xxxd2071xxx  treatment,[23] and reintroduction of the drug when it does occur produces a beneficial response.[22]
the most common form of psoriasis, plaquetype psoriasis, responds variably to both drugs. although complete clearing of the lesions is achieved
in only about 30% of treated patients, a significant
improvement is obtained in a further 50%.[24-28]
the decrease in the psoriasis area and severity
index (pasi) score is approximately 60 to 70%,
depending on the dosage.[8] approximately 20% of
patients may be considered treatment failures.[8,27]
one of the main reasons for treatment interruption is initial worsening of the disease with an increase in erythema. another is an increase in the
extent of the lesions, which may occur within a few
days of the start of treatment at dosage of 0.5 to 1.0
mg/kg/day, i.e. 30 to 70 mg/day. a therapeutic dosage scheme using initially low dosages (10 mg/day)
of  xxxd2071xxx [29] or  xxxd71xxx ,[30] followed by progressively increasing the dosage, seems to avoid this
initial worsening.[4]
in order to define the efficacy of  xxxd71xxx  as
monotherapy, different dosages (10 to 75 mg/day)
were compared in a double-blind fashion with placebo in patients with psoriasis. at the end of an
8-week treatment period,  xxxd71xxx  at dosages of 25
biodrugs 2000 may; 13 (5)

330

and 50 mg/day[31] and 50 and 75 mg/day[32] was
superior to placebo in two studies. the efficacy of
10 mg/day was not significantly different from that
of placebo in either study.[4]
total clearing of the lesions usually requires a
combination of treatments such as retinoids plus
topical corticosteroids,[33] dithranol (anthralin)[34]
or photochemotherapy (psoralen plus ultraviolet a;
puva).[35-37]
3.1.3 combination with ultraviolet therapy

one of the major developments for the treatment of widespread plaque-type psoriasis in recent
years has been the combined use of puva photochemotherapy with the retinoids  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx  (re-puva therapy). the effects of  xxxd2071xxx 
and puva appear to be additive.[35,36,38]
more recently, studies using  xxxd71xxx  clearly
demonstrated the superiority of re-puva. in a
double-blind comparative trial,[19] patients with
psoriasis received either retinoid ( xxxd71xxx  or  xxxd2071xxx  50 mg/day) or placebo without puva for 2
weeks. this monotherapy phase was followed by a
combined therapy phase as follows: retinoid ( xxxd71xxx  or  xxxd2071xxx  25 mg/day) or placebo, plus puva
given 3 times a week until remission. although  xxxd2071xxx  plus puva was better than placebo plus
puva, statistically significant differences in the
number of puva exposures and total dose of ultraviolet a (uva) until remission were shown only
between  xxxd71xxx  plus puva and placebo plus
puva. the efficacy of  xxxd71xxx  was confirmed in
another study which showed that the mean cumulative uva dose was 42% less in the  xxxd71xxx  plus
puva group than in the placebo plus puva
group.[39]
the main advantages of the re-puva combination are the acceleration of the response rate of
psoriatic lesions and the clearing of lesions in patients that could not be cleared with the retinoid or
puva alone. a further advantage is that the radiation exposure necessary to produce remission is
significantly lower with re-puva. the lower radiation dosage is likely to diminish the risk of puvainduced carcinogenic effects, which are clearly uvadose dependent.[40] oral retinoids can also be

combined with bath puva (psoralen bath plus uva),
which also allows a reduction in the effective dose
of uva.[41]
the combination of  xxxd2071xxx [42] or acitre[43,44]
with ultraviolet b (uvb) phototherapy has
tin
been shown to be more effective in patients with
psoriasis than retinoid or uvb phototherapy alone.
3.1.4 treatment of patients with hiv infection

the frequency of psoriasis in patients with
hiv infection does not differ significantly from the
occurrence of the disorder in patients who do not
have hiv infection. however, the psoriasis in hivinfected patients tends to be more aggressive, and
treatment poses a unique challenge. topical agents
are not usually sufficient to control the disease process in this group of patients. potentially immunosuppressive treatments for psoriasis, including phototherapy and the use of corticosteroids, methotrexate
and cyclosporin, are contraindicated. eleven patients with psoriasis associated with hiv infection
were enrolled in a 20-week treatment protocol. six
(54%) of the 11 achieved good to excellent responses
using  xxxd71xxx  monotherapy. parameters of immunosuppression were not exacerbated by  xxxd71xxx 
therapy. both skin and joint manifestations responded to  xxxd71xxx  therapy in most patients. optimal
results were achieved with a dosage of 75 mg/day.
the adverse effects were moderate and well tolerated. thus,  xxxd71xxx  does not appear to have immunosuppressive properties. in fact, its mode of action
in psoriasis is unknown, regardless of hiv status.[45]
3.1.5 adverse effects and contraindications

there is one absolute contraindication to use of
retinoids: pregnancy. retinoids are potent teratogens,[46] and women must avoid conception not only
during treatment but also for a certain period after
stopping therapy. calculation of the recommended
post-therapy contraception period can be based on
the elimination half-life of the retinoid; i.e. it takes
7 times the half-life to eliminate 99% of the drug
from the body. the teratogenic potential of plasma
and tissue concentrations of the remaining drug is
assumed to be negligible. however, this approach
seems not to be universally accepted, which explains
biodrugs 2000 may; 13 (5)

retinoid drugs in management of psoriasis

the differences in the pregnancy warnings between
countries.
in most countries, however, the post-therapy
contraception period is 2 years for  xxxd2071xxx . a 2month period was initially proposed for  xxxd71xxx 
but, since it is now apparent that  xxxd71xxx  may metabolise to  xxxd2071xxx , it is logical to extend the contraception period for  xxxd71xxx  to that for  xxxd2071xxx .
when  xxxd71xxx  is given to women of childbearing
age, consumption of alcohol should be forbidden
because alcohol appears to be a major factor in the
formation of  xxxd2071xxx  from  xxxd71xxx  (see section
3.1.1).
other adverse effects of retinoids are generally
preventable or manageable through proper patient
selection, dosage adjustments and routine management. mucocutaneous adverse effects such as cheilitis and hair loss are the most common dose-dependent adverse effects; these require dose reduction
in some patients. hepatotoxicity, serum lipid alterations, pancreatitis and possible skeletal effects are
less common adverse effects. careful monitoring is
necessary in patients with a history of hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, atherosclerosis or
pancreatitis.  xxxd71xxx  or  xxxd2071xxx  should not be
given to patients with serious retinal disorders.[4,47]
3.2 isotretinoin

isotretinoin has a lesser effect on psoriasis than
 xxxd71xxx  or  xxxd2071xxx , although some efficacy has
been shown in combination with puva.[5,48] nevertheless, some dermatologists continue to use isotretinoin in women with psoriasis who need systemic retinoids, to avoid the long post- xxxd71xxx 
contraception period.[49]
five patients with generalised pustular psoriasis
treated with oral isotretinoin showed significant
improvement in a small study.[50] in an open study,
11 patients with generalised pustular psoriasis were
treated with oral isotretinoin 1.5 to 2 mg/kg/day; pustular lesions were completely cleared in 10 of the
11 patients. the systemic symptoms completely resolved during this time. follow-up of these patients for up to 2 months showed that the majority
subsequently required an alternative agent to achieve

331

satisfactory control of their psoriasis. it appears
that isotretinoin aborted the attack of generalised
pustulation but was not effective in treating the residual psoriasis when used alone.[51]
in a nonblinded study comparing isotretinoin
with  xxxd2071xxx , 10 patients who had psoriasis affecting 20 to 50% of their body surface area were
treated with isotretinoin 1.5 mg/kg/day for at least
8 weeks, and 19 patients who had psoriasis affecting 40 to 90% of their body surface were treated
with  xxxd2071xxx  0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 8 weeks.
18 of 19 patients treated with  xxxd2071xxx  had either
a complete or a moderate response, while only 4 of
10 patients treated with isotretinoin were moderate
or complete responders. thus, analysis showed a
significant difference in favour of the etretinatetreated group.[51]
because of teratogenicity concerns, women of
child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and practise effective contraception during and for 1 month after completing therapy with
isotretinoin. the mandatory 1-month post-therapy
contraceptive period is necessary in order to afford
a sufficient safety margin, since plasma concentrations of isotretinoin return to physiological levels
within 10 days of therapy completion.[52]
3.3 topical  xxxd3297xxx 

 xxxd3297xxx  is a synthetic analogue and the first
topical retinoid that has been demonstrated to be
both effective and tolerable in treating plaque-type
psoriasis.  xxxd3297xxx  gel is available in 2 concentrations, 0.05 and 0.1%.
the molecular structure of  xxxd3297xxx  was engineered in such a way as to make it selective for the
rar class of nuclear receptors over retinoid x receptors (rxr), with preferential activation of rarbeta and  xxxg1933xxx  over  xxxg1931xxx .[6] there are, however,
no data indicating that this receptor binding profile
is involved in the antipsoriatic activity of  xxxd3297xxx .
on the basis of current available data,  xxxd3297xxx 
can be used for the treatment of chronic, stable, plaquetype psoriasis on the trunk or limbs, covering up to
20% of the body surface area.[53]
biodrugs 2000 may; 13 (5)

332

arechalde & saurat

the clinical efficacy and tolerability of topical  xxxd3297xxx  have been investigated in vehicle-controlled
and active-controlled studies. it has been demonstrated to be significantly more effective than vehicle,
and comparable in efficacy to  xxxd2129xxx  0.05% but
with a more sustained therapeutic effect after treatment is stopped.[54] in clinical trials, patients generally experienced a clinical response within 4 weeks
of starting  xxxd3297xxx  treatment, and improvement
was maintained for up to 12 weeks after stopping
therapy.[54]
ongoing studies are evaluating the use of  xxxd3297xxx  in combination with other antipsoriatic medications. the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd3297xxx 
can be enhanced by the addition of topical corticosteroids. when used in combination with broad-band
uvb phototherapy,  xxxd3297xxx  reduces the amount
of uv light required to treat plaques.[55]
 xxxd3297xxx  is associated with skin irritation in
many patients, which can be managed by reducing
the concentration or frequency of application, or by
adding a topical corticosteroid.[53]
the irritative potential of  xxxd3297xxx  appears to
be counterbalanced by a sustained therapeutic effect after treatment is stopped. this may prove to
be a major advantage for the drug; however, it requires confirmation in studies aimed at appropriately defining the magnitude of this effect.
4. conclusions
so far, the major advances in the molecular pharmacology of retinoids have not been translated into
adequate therapeutic answers to the challenge of
treating patients with psoriasis. the teratogenic risk
has clearly shifted the interest of drug developers
towards topical compounds, the first of which,  xxxd3297xxx , although useful, was not a breakthrough. it is
hoped that retinoids with a specific pharmacological
profile, for instance those that dissociate antiproliferative activity from others, will soon be developed.
