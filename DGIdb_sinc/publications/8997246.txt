application
of ethanol to the gastrointestinal
mucosa induces vasodilation.
using an in vivo microscopy
technique,
we studied the effect of topical ethanol on the
submucosal
microvessels
that control mucosal blood flow in
the rat stomach and identified
vasoactive
substances
and
receptors that mediate the ethanol vasoaction. topical ethanol (l-20%)
dilated submucosal
arterioles
dose dependently,
but did not change venular diameters. an inhibitor
of alcohol
dehydrogenase,
1 mm  xxxd2148xxx ,
did not alter the
ethanol vasoaction.
 xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation
was
eliminated
by adenosine
deaminase,
but other vasodilator
inhibitors
such as atropine,
 xxxd3050xxx ,
indomethacin,
human calcitonin
gene-related
peptide-(8-37),
and no-nitro-larginine
methyl ester did not prevent it.  xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation was inhibited
by an adenosine az-receptor
antagonist,
but not by an al-receptor
antagonist,
whereas an
az-agonist, but not an al-agonist,
dose dependently
dilated
arterioles. exogenous adenosine ( 10-5-10-3
m) dilated arterioles to a similar
extent as ethanol.
this response was
inhibited
by an az-antagonist.
we conclude that nonmetabolized ethanol increases gastric mucosal blood flow via azreceptors in submucosal arterioles.

of ethanol increases portal blood flow
(3, 22). this h emodynamic change results from increases in gastrointestinal blood flow (4). exposure of
ethanol to the gastrointestinal mucosa increases blood
flow. the gastric mucosal microvessels in rats consist of
true capillaries and postcapillary venules. these microvessels rarely dilate or constrict; thus they cannot
themselves regulate mucosal blood flow. the vessels
that control the gastric mucosal blood flow are the
submucosal arterioles and venules (9). the submucosal
arterioles respond particularly well to vasoactive substances (9,26). topical ethanol may diffuse through the
mucosa into the submucosa, change the diameters of
the arterioles or venules, and then alter the mucosal
blood flow. thus the first aim of this study was to
observe the effect of topical ethanol on arterioles and
venules in the submucosa. ethanol was directly applied
to the submucosa in this study.

during diffusion through the mucosa, before reaching
the submucosal microvessels. our second aim was to
see whether  xxxd2148xxx ,
an inhibitor of alcohol
dehydrogenase, alters the  xxxd102xxx induced microvascular response.
many vasodilators play a role in maintaining gastric
blood flow in a steady state. calcitonin gene-related
peptide (cgrp) was found to be a potent vasodilator in
the stomach, mediating hyperemic reaction during acid
back-diffusion (13). endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  is a vasodilator in the rat stomach and plays a protective role in
the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal lesions (14). histamine and  xxxd208xxx  metabolites have been proposed as agents for ethanol vasoaction (21, 26). our
third aim, therefore, was to identify vasoactive substances that mediate the action of ethanol. adenosine
mediates the  xxxd102xxx induced increase in portal blood
flow (22). it seems that adenosine is released into the
interstitial
spaces in the digestive organs after the
ingestion of ethanol. wood et al. (25) found that locally
released adenosine mediated  xxxd102xxx induced vasodilation in the dog stomach. if adenosine in fact was
involved in  xxxd102xxx induced vasodilation in the rat
stomach, then our fourth aim was to determine the
subtype of adenosine receptors that mediate the vasoaction of ethanol.

discussion

in the present study, l-20% ethanol applied to the
rat submucosa
dilated arterioles
in a dose-dependent
manner. application
of o&-40% ethanol did not change
venular diameters,
however.
these results
confirmed
the findings of yonei et al. (26). although
we do not
know the exact ethanol concentration
in the gastric
submucosa
after ingestion of ethanol, the ethanol concentration in the gastric tissue is much higher than the
serum concentration
(15). direct diffusion
from the
mucosal surface will produce dramatically
higher concentrations
of ethanol in the gastric tissue. ethanol
may diffuse through the mucosa, reach the submucosa,
and then dilate the arterioles that regulate the mucosal
blood flow.
we then studied the mechanism
of the arteriolar
dilation induced by ethanol, using concurrent
application of antagonists
or synthase
inhibitors
of known
vasodilators.
only  xxxg62xxx  was found to
eliminate
 xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation.

receptor

gl031

and  xxxd2738xxx  are released by various stimuli such as
acid secretion and acid back-diffusion
(13, 21, 23). the
present study demonstrated
that neither the  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx ,
the h2-receptor
antagonist
cimetidine, the muscarinic-receptor
antagonist atropine,
nor the cgrp-receptor
antagonist
hcgrp-(8-37)
inhibited
 xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation. we applied these antagonists
in doses known
to produce maximum inhibition
of the agonists’ vasodilation in the rat submucosa
(5, 10, 18). therefore,
the
present study indicates that histamine,
acetylcholine,
and cgrp do not mediate  xxxd102xxx induced
vasodilation
in the rat stomach. because topical indomethacin
did
not inhibit the arteriolar
dilation by ethanol, release of
prostaglandin
does not seem to be involved
in the
ethanol vasoaction. we applied lo+ m indomethacin
to
block local synthesis
of prostaglandin,
because this
concentration
of indomethacin
sufficiently
blocks in
vivo prostaglandin
synthesis
(7,12,17).
yonei et al. (26)
found that ethanol caused constriction
of the submucosal arterioles
accompanied
by sluggish blood flow with
the formation
of white thrombi along the vessel wall in
the rat pretreated
with subcutaneous
indomethacin.
their results contrast with ours. this conflict may be
due to differences
in the administration
route of indomethacin. intravenous
administration
of indomethacin
reduced the basal arteriolar
diameter in rats (9) and
basal mucosal
blood flow in dogs (11). before the
ethanol vasoaction was studied, the basal vascular tone
and coagulative
state could have been altered by the
subcutaneous
indomethacin,
establishing
another basal
state. because tetrodotoxin
did not decrease the ethanolinduced arteriolar
dilation
neural involvement
in the
action of ethanol is unlikely. submucosal suffusion with
3 x 1o-4 m l-name
a  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor
reduced the arteriolar
diameter but failed to decrease
 xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation. thus it is unlikely
that endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  is involved in the ethanol
vasoaction.
this result is consistent
with the study by
chen et al. (6), in which they showed that submucosal
suffusion with 3 x lop4 m l-name produced inhibition
of  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis
but did not inhibit arteriolar
dilation induced by topical adenosine, the mediator of
the ethanol vasoaction
indicated in this study.  xxxg62xxx , an enzyme that metabolizes
adenosine
to inosine, however,
did inhibit the  xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation. this result suggests that ethanol
releases adenosine from the gastric tissue locally and
that the adenosine dilates submucosal
arterioles.
our
results are consistent
with those of wood et al. (25) in
the dog stomach, in which adenosine (but not histamine
or prostaglandin)
mediated ethanol vasodilation.
we then studied subtypes
of adenosine receptors
on
submucosal
arterioles
that mediate the action of ethanol. we found that adenosine a2-receptors
mediate the
 xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
response. concurrent
application of dpcpx,
a selective al-receptor
antagonist,
failed to attenuate
the arteriolar
dilation induced by
ethanol. on the other hand, dmpx,
a selective asreceptor
antagonist,
significantly
and dose-dependently decreased  xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation.

ethanol

vasoaction

and

adenosine

this result indicates
that  xxxd102xxx induced
arteriolar
dilation is mediated bya2-receptors
on the submucosal
arterioles.
to verify this hypothesis,
we performed
an
adenosine agonist study. application
of 10~g-10~4 m
cpca, a selective az-receptor
agonist, dilated arterioles in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas application
of cpa, a selective al-receptor
agonist, did not dilate
the arterioles. a selective az-receptor antagonist, dmpx,
prevented the arteriolar
dilation induced by cpca, an
az-receptor
agonist. finally, we studied the effect of
exogenous adenosine on the submucosal
microvessels
to observe whether
adenosine truly dilates arterioles
via the az receptors.
exogenous adenosine ( 10~5-10~3
m) dilated
the submucosal
arterioles
in a dosedependent manner. the az-antagonist
dmpx inhibited
the arteriolar
dilation induced by exogenous adenosine.
exogenous adenosine produced vasodilation
to a similar degree, as seen during topical application
of ethanol. the concentrations
of adenosine used in this study
that dilated submucosal
arterioles and the involvement
ofaz-receptors
in arteriolar
dilation in the rat stomach
are consistent with the findings of gerber and guth (8).
carmichael
et al. (4) showed that az-receptors
mediated the increase
in portal blood flow after ethanol
injection. a predominance
of az-receptors
in vasoaction
has been found in the rat small intestine
(24) and
mesentery
(1).
the mechanism
of adenosine generation and release
in the rat stomach
is unclear. parietal
cells are a
potential source of adenosine, because these cells exhibit a rapid turnover
of atp, a metabolic precursor
of
adenosine. mckaigney
et al. (16) showed that in the rat,
an increase in portal blood flow after ethanol ingestion
was mediated by ethanol metabolites.
carmichael
et al.
(4) emphasized
that acetate metabolized
from ethanol
generated adenosine through its conversion
to acetyl
coenzyme q, resulting
in an increase in portal blood
flow. however,
they did not observe any increase in
gastric and splenic blood flow after acetate administration. it is unlikely
that ethanol metabolites
are involved in the microvascular
response
in this study,
because a powerful
inhibitor of  xxxg110xxx ,
 xxxd2148xxx ,
failed to modify the arteriolar
and
venular responses
of ethanol. in addition,
arteriolar
diameters
returned
to the basal size after removal of
ethanol in this study. the rapid reversibility
of arteriolar response argues against a metabolite-induced
action of ethanol on early vasodilation.
acute exposure of
cells to ethanol inhibits adenosine uptake (19,20). as a
result, adenosine accumulates
extracellularly
and activates adenosine receptors. because we challenged ethanol acutely and determined
early vasoaction,
the arteriolar dilation seen in this study is likely to be due to
inhibited uptake of adenosine.
we conclude that ethanol, but not ethanol metabolites, locally releases adenosine from rat gastric tissue.
adenosine
dilates the submucosal
arterioles
via azreceptors,
thus resulting
in an increase in mucosal
blood flow.
