synthase by antifungal imidazole agents*

the antifungal imidazoles  xxxd2640xxx , ketoconazole,
and  xxxd1732xxx  inhibit citrulline formation by nitricoxide synthase. these agents both increase the concentration of calmodulin required to activate the enzyme
half-maximally and reduce the maximal velocity of
citrulline formation. this inhibition was not reversed
by increased concentrations of either the arginine substrate or (6r)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-~-biopterin.
 xxxd2640xxx , ketoconazole, and  xxxd1732xxx  also inhibited the
cytochrome-c reductase activity of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase competitively versus calmodulin concentration,
with apparent ki (ica,-,) values of 8, 20, and 0.8 pm,
respectively.  xxxd2640xxx , ketoconazole, and  xxxd1732xxx  inhibited the activity of calmodulin-dependent
 xxxg1696xxx  competitively versus calmodulin concentration, with apparent k i values
of 6,18,and 25 pm, respectively.
these observations are consistent with the proposal
that the antifungal imidazoles inhibit citrulline formation by interaction with the  xxxd2738xxx  synthaseat
two sites. interaction at site 1 reduces the responsiveness of the enzyme to activation by calmodulin,
whereas interaction at site 2 (involving putative binding of the imidazole to the heme iron) reduces the
maximal velocity of citrulline formation. the interactions of calmodulin antagonists at site 1 occur at substantially lower concentrations of drug than those at
site 2 and are the principal determinant of enzyme
inhibition.

 xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd1732xxx , and ketoconazole are antimycotic
agents that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast by inhibiting 14a-demethylase, a microsomal cytochrome p-450-dependent enzyme system. l4a-methyl sterols that accumulate
intracellularly are incorporated into the
lipid bilayer, disrupting its structure and consequently cellular growth (1).imidazole antimycotic agentshave been shown to inhibit
a variety
of cytochrome p-450-dependent enzyme activities including
steroid aromatase(2) and ratliver microsomal cytochrome p 450 isoforms (3). the imidazole antimycotic agents, however,
do not inhibit cytochrome-p-450 reductaseactivity.  xxxd2640xxx , ketoconazole, and itraconazole have been shown to bind
to cytochrome p-450 isoforms derived from such divergent
microsomal sourcesas human placenta(2) and saccharomyces
cereuisiae (4), producing type i1 difference spectra. the formation of these spectra is consistent with the interaction of

their imidazole nitrogens with the heme iron. the bindingof
the imidazoles to the heme iron was found to interfere with
the binding of carbon monoxide to these hemoproteins and
presumably similarly inhibits the abilityof oxygen to bind.
recent investigations have shown that imidazole antimycotic agents including  xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd1732xxx , and ketoconazole inhibit the operation
of receptor-operated ca2+channels
( 5 ) , voltage-gated ca2+ channels in ghs and adrenal chromaffin cells (6), and ca2+-dependent k+ channels ( 7 ) . these
observations have been interpreted to indicate that a hemoprotein is involved in the regulation of these ion channels.
in the accompanying paper (8), we have shown that imidazole and phenylimidazoles inhibittheactivity
of cam’dependent  xxxd2738xxx  synthase from bovine brain. this observation encouraged us to explore the effects of antifungal
imidazoles onnitric-oxidesynthase.wereport
here that
 xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd1732xxx , and ketoconazole inhibit the camdependent  xxxd2738xxx  synthase by interaction at two sites.
by interaction at the first site, thesedrugs act ascompetitive
camantagonists; by interactionatthe
second site,they
inhibitcitrullineformationin
a manner not reversible by
elevated concentrations of cam, thb, or the arginine substrate.

effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on formation of citrulline by nitricoxide synthase-initial experiments exploring the effects of
 xxxd2640xxx  on citrulline formation by bovine brain nitricoxide synthase revealed that the cam concentration affected
the apparent ki (ic5,,) value for  xxxd2640xxx  (data not shown).
a detailed examination was therefore undertakenof the effect
of  xxxd2640xxx  on the cam concentration dependence of citrulline formation by  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (fig. 1). xxxd2640xxx  was found to antagonize the activation of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase by cam. as measured without  xxxd2640xxx , the concentration of cam required to effect half-maximal activation
(kact)of citrulline formation was 2 nm cam. the concentrations of cam required to effect half-maximal activation in
the presence of 10 and 33 pm  xxxd2640xxx  (apparent keet
values) were 7 and 15 nm cam, respectively.  xxxd2640xxx  was
also found to alter themaximal velocity of citrulline formation
as measured at saturating concentrations (600 nm to 2 p m ) of
cam. a t 10 and 33 pm  xxxd2640xxx , the maximal rate of
citrulline formation was reduced to 85 and 61%, respectively,
of the value observed in the absence of  xxxd2640xxx . elevated
concentrations of cam werethus able to reverse partially the
inhibitory actions of  xxxd2640xxx  on citrulline formation.
the effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on the arginine concentration
dependence of citrulline formation by  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
was determined at saturating concentrations of cam (fig. 2).
 xxxd2640xxx  was found to decrease the maximal velocity of
citrulline formation, but did not alter the k , of the enzyme
for the arginine substrate, a noncompetitive pattern of inhibition.

whether the inhibitory properties
of  xxxd2640xxx  are uniqueor
are shared more broadly by other antifungal agents, we examined theeffects of ketoconazole,  xxxd1732xxx , and itraconazole on the cam dependence of citrulline formation. ketoconazole(fig. 4a) antagonized the activation of citrulline
formation by cam. when measured without ketoconazole, a
kactof 4 nm cam was observed. at 150 and 300 p~ ketoconazole, apparent k,,, values of 18 and 31 nm cam were observed, respectively. ketoconazole also reduced the maximal
velocity of citrulline formation measured at saturating concentrations (600 nm to 10 p m ) of cam. at 150 and 300 p m
ketoconazole, maximal velocities were 75 and 56%, respectively, of the value obtained in the absenceof ketoconazole.
 xxxd1732xxx  (fig. 4 b ) also antagonized the activation of
citrulline formation by cam. when measured without  xxxd1732xxx , a kact
of 5 nm cam was observed. in the presence of
30 and 100 p~  xxxd1732xxx , apparent k,,, values of 16 and25
nm cam were observed,respectively. xxxd1732xxx  also reduced the maximal velocity of citrulline formation measured
at saturating concentrations (600 nm to 10 p m ) of cam. at
30 and 100 p~  xxxd1732xxx , maximal velocities were 94 and
75%, respectively, of the value obtained in the absence of
 xxxd1732xxx .
at a concentration of 100 p~
itraconazole (data not shown)
did not alter the cam concentration dependence
of citrulline
formation,but reduced themaximal velocity of citrulline
formation to 71% of its control (without drug) value. thus,
 xxxd2640xxx , ketoconazole, and  xxxd1732xxx  antagonized the

tion of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase by cam, we examined whether
these drugs would also affect the activation by cam of the
cytochrome-c reductase activity of this enzyme.  xxxd2640xxx 
(fig. 5a), ketoconazole (fig. 5 b ) , and  xxxd1732xxx  (fig. 5 b )
were each found to inhibit the cam-dependent stimulation
of
 xxxg569xxx  reduction. since the effects of these drugs on
citrulline formation had been found to be largely reversible
by saturating concentrations of cam, these measurements
were conducted at subsaturating concentrationsof cam. apm

examined the cam concentrationdependence of cytochrome

 xxxd2640xxx  (fig. 6).  xxxd2640xxx  was
found to be
a competitive
inhibitor of  xxxg569xxx  reduction, that is, the inhibition
could be completely reversed by elevated
concentrations of
cam. this contrasts with itsbehavior in inhibiting citrulline
formation, where the effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on activity could
be overcome onlypartially by elevated concentrations of cam.

inhibit the cytochrome p-450 drug metabolizing system in
uiuo, whereas itraconazole does not (32). ketoconazole inhibits steroid hydroxylation reactions involved in the biosynthesis of testosterone, estrogen, glucocorticoids, and 1,25dihydroxycholecalciferol (33) and accordingly has been used
to treatprostate and breastcarcinomas, hyperadrenalism, and
hypercalcemia.  xxxd2640xxx  conventionally achieves a maximal therapeutic plasma concentration of 10 pg/ml, of which
92% is bound to albumin, while 8%is found free in the water
phase of plasma (34). ketoconazole conventionally achieves
a maximal therapeutic plasma concentration of 7 pg/ml, of
which 95% is bound to plasma albumin (35). despite this
extensive albumin binding, both drugs achieve high volumes
of distribution, exceeding 150 litersl70 kg, indicating that
most of the drug in the body is associated either with lipids
or macromolecular cellular constituents. the maximal free
concentration of ketoconazole distributedthroughout the
