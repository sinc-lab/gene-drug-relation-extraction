background systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a complex genetic disease; the
 xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) has been shown to be related to different kinds
of autoimmune disorders; and copy number variations (cnvs) have been found
to be associated with various types of diseases.
objectives to explore a possible association between  xxxg1081xxx  (formerly  xxxg1081xxx ) cnvs
and the risk of sle.
methods genomic dna and rna from 340 patients with sle and 392 healthy controls were extracted, and cnvs and mrna levels of  xxxg1081xxx  were examined.
results the expression of  xxxg1081xxx  mrna was significantly increased in patients with
sle compared with controls. amplification of  xxxg1081xxx  copy numbers significantly
increased the risk of sle [p < 0æ001, odds ratio (or) 2æ26, 95% confidence
interval (ci) 1æ50–3æ40].  xxxg1081xxx  amplifications also positively correlated with the
incidence of arthritis (p = 0æ019, or 1æ96, 95% ci 1æ11–3æ47), and proteinuria
(p < 0æ001, or 2æ95, 95% ci 1æ73–5æ00) and antinuclear antibody abnormalities
(p < 0æ001, or 2æ97, 95% ci 1æ66–5æ33). deletions of  xxxg1081xxx  copy numbers were
protective against proteinuria (p = 0æ03, or 0æ50, 95% ci 0æ26–0æ94).
conclusion cnvs of the  xxxg1081xxx  gene are associated with sle.

systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a complex autoimmune
disease characterized by autoantibody production, immune
complex deposition and subsequent tissue destruction. the
aetiology of sle remains unclear, although both genetic and
environmental factors are involved.1–4 two recent genomewide association studies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) confirmed some previously associated loci and
revealed new genetic regions related to sle.5,6 however, the
role of copy number variations (cnvs) in the genetic contribution to sle still awaits extensive investigation.
cnvs are defined by the presence of variable copies of
genomic regions in different individuals. several methodologies, such as the commonly used array-based comparative
genomic hybridization, have been used for genome-wide cnv
detection and genotyping. cnvs have been found to have
phenotypic consequences and to be associated with various

types of diseases including mental disorders and rheumatoid
arthritis.7–9 to date, no genome-wide cnv studies have been
performed for sle. examples of cnv loci associated with sle
include complement component 4 ( xxxg283xxx ),10,11 fc-gamma
receptor 3b ( xxxg776xxx ),12,13  xxxg2291xxx  ( xxxg2291xxx )14 and
 xxxg361xxx -like 1 (ccl3l1).15
the  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) is a g-protein-coupled
receptor predominantly expressed on cells of the immune
system, including mast cells, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, dendritic cells, t cells and natural killer cells. the
expression pattern of  xxxg1081xxx  and its chemotactic properties
denote its role in immunomodulation (reviewed16,17).  xxxg1081xxx 
has been shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (ra),18–20 but
the genetic association between  xxxg1081xxx  (formerly  xxxg1081xxx ) and sle
remains poorly investigated.

936  xxxg1081xxx  copy number variations and sle, b. yu et al.

in our previous study, we identified three new snps in the
 xxxg1081xxx  gene (ss142022671, ss142022677 and ss142022679)
and found that polymorphisms of  xxxg1081xxx  increased the risk of
atopic dermatitis (ad) and affected  xxxg1081xxx  expression.21 we
then investigated the role of  xxxg1081xxx  in sle, and observed elevated  xxxg1081xxx  expression in the blood samples of patients with
sle, but we did not find a significant association between
polymorphisms of  xxxg1081xxx  and sle. therefore, in this study, we
focused on cnvs of  xxxg1081xxx , aiming to explore the possible
association between  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs and the risk of sle.

materials and methods
study populations
the present study included 340 patients with sle (28 male
and 312 female; median age 29 years, range 12–55) and 392
healthy controls (32 male and 360 female; median age
28 years, range 17–46). all patients fulfilled the american
college of rheumatology criteria for sle.22 the study was
approved by the ethical committee of the shenzhen hospital,
peking university. the individuals gave their written informed
consent. the investigations were conducted according to the
declaration of helsinki principles.
quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction
total rna was isolated from whole blood by using the axyprep blood total rna miniprep kit (axygen biotechnology,
hangzhou, china) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. first-strand cdna was synthesized with revertaid
first strand cdna synthesis kit (fermentas life sciences, burlington, on, canada). quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) was performed with a biorad chromo4 real-time pcr
system (bio-rad, hercules, ca, u.s.a.). the relative  xxxg1081xxx 
mrna level was presented by using the comparative c(t)
method23,24 with  xxxg861xxx  as the internal control. data from
three independent experiments were analysed by student’s
t-test and p < 0æ05 was considered statistically significant. the
primers for  xxxg1081xxx  are: forward, 5¢-gtggttagcataggttatac-3¢ and reverse, 5¢-atgccactgcactcctgc-3¢. the
primers for  xxxg861xxx  are: forward, 5¢-cagcctcaagatcatcagca-3¢ and reverse, 5¢-tgtggtcatgagtccttcca-3¢.
genotyping methods
genomic dna was isolated from the peripheral blood of the
candidates using the genomic dna extraction kit (innogent,
shenzhen, china) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the three exons of the  xxxg1081xxx  gene were amplified by pcr
using primers as shown in table 1. the pcr reaction was
carried out in a total reaction volume of 20 ll using the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95 c for
4 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 25 s
and finishing with annealing and extension at 60 c for 1 min.

the pcr products were sequenced using both the forward and
reverse primers. the sequencing results were aligned with the
ncbi sequence nt_010966.13 by ncbi alignment. duplicate
samples were included to check the accuracy of genotyping.
quantiﬁcation of copy numbers
quantitative pcr was performed with the biorad chromo4
real-time pcr system. average copy numbers of rnase p in
normal candidates (copy number = 2) were used as the control.25 the copy numbers were calculated by using the comparative c(t) method. cut-off values of 0æ25, 0æ75, 1æ25, 1æ75
and 2æ25 were used to define the copy numbers as 0, 1, 2, 3
and 4, respectively. the primers for rnase p are: forward,
5¢-agactagggtcagaagcaa-3¢ and reverse, 5¢-catttcactgaatccgttc-3¢. the primers for  xxxg1081xxx  are forward:
5¢-gtggttagcataggttatac-3¢and reverse, 5¢-atgccactgcactcctgc-3¢.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis comparing the allele and genotype distributions was performed using the chi-squared test or fisher’s
exact test. odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals
(cis) were calculated according to woolf’s method, using spss
10.0 software for windows (spss, chicago, il, u.s.a.).
p < 0æ05 was considered statistically significant.

results
increased  xxxg1081xxx  mrna levels in the blood samples of
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
we checked the mrna levels of  xxxg1081xxx  in the blood samples of
340 patients with sle and 392 healthy controls by quantitative
pcr, and found that  xxxg1081xxx  expression was significantly higher
in patients with sle than in controls (fig. 1).
the association between  xxxg1081xxx  copy number variations
and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus
in our previous study, we identified three new snps in the
 xxxg1081xxx  gene (ss142022671, ss142022677 and ss142022679)
and explored their association with ad.21 we found that
polymorphisms of  xxxg1081xxx  increased the risk of ad and affected
 xxxg1081xxx  expression.21 however, such an association was not
observed in patients with sle compared with controls (see
supporting information). as cnvs are expected to alter gene
dosage and affect gene expression, we wondered whether the
elevated  xxxg1081xxx  expression in patients with sle was caused by
the cnvs in the  xxxg1081xxx  gene. therefore, we examined the copy
numbers of  xxxg1081xxx  in patients with sle and controls, and
observed a significant difference between the two groups
(table 2). then, we separately analysed the association of
 xxxg1081xxx  deletions (copy numbers < 2) and amplifications (copy
numbers > 2) with the risk of sle. as shown in table 2,

interestingly, deletions of  xxxg1081xxx  were also found to be protective against proteinuria (p = 0æ03, or 0æ50, 95% ci 0æ26–

criteria of sle.

discussion

fig 1.  xxxg1081xxx  mrna levels are higher in the blood samples of patients
with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) compared with controls.
total rna was isolated from blood samples, and then reverse
transcribed. sybr green-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction
was used to measure the relative mrna levels of  xxxg1081xxx . the average
mrna level in the wild-type population was set as 1. data from three
independent experiments were analysed by student’s t-test. the
non-normal distribution data were presented as 50% median (25%
and 75% median) and range (max. and min.).

deletions of  xxxg1081xxx  were not associated with sle (p = 0æ535),
but amplifications of  xxxg1081xxx  significantly increased the risk of
sle (p < 0æ001, or 2æ26, 95% ci 1æ50–3æ40).
the association between  xxxg1081xxx  copy number variations
and the diagnostic criteria of systemic lupus
erythematosus
in order to analyse further the significance of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs in
sle, we compared the distribution of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs in sle
according to different diagnostic criteria. among the 11 criteria used, the incidence rates of serositis and neurological disorders in our study were low, and thus they were not
subjected to statistical analysis. table 3 shows the association
of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs with the clinical symptoms of sle.  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs
were associated with arthritis (p = 0æ008), and amplifications
of  xxxg1081xxx  significantly increased the incidence of arthritis
(p = 0æ019, or 1æ96, 95% ci 1æ11–3æ47). table 4 shows the
association of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs with the laboratory parameters of
sle.  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs were associated with proteinuria (p < 0æ001)
and antinuclear antibody abnormalities (p < 0æ005). amplification of  xxxg1081xxx  significantly increased proteinuria (p < 0æ001,

the expression pattern of  xxxg1081xxx  implies that it has a role in
immune and inflammatory responses. the clearest expression
is in eosinophils, mast cells and dendritic cells, which are the
most important cell types involved in immune disorders and
inflammation.26–29  xxxg1081xxx  activation promotes the accumulation of inflammatory cells (particularly eosinophils and mast
cells) to sites of inflammation.26 experiments in mice showed
that mast cells from wild-type and  xxxg1080xxx -deleted mice
migrated in response to histamine, while mast cells from the
 xxxg1081xxx -deleted mice did not, indicating that the  xxxg1081xxx -mediated
chronic inflammatory effects of histamine may be essential in
the inflammatory disorders. histamine as well as the  xxxg1081xxx 
agonist clobenpropit induced an enhanced chemotaxis in the
skin dendritic cell migration assay. the enhanced chemotaxis
was blocked by the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj7777120.30 in
addition to mediating chemotaxis and cell migration,  xxxg1081xxx 
affects other cell functions such as inflammatory mediator production. also, the effects of  xxxg1081xxx  on dendritic cell migration,
cytokine production and t-cell activation could point to a role
for this receptor in autoimmune disease initiation and progression.27,31,32 thus, the  xxxg1081xxx  gene represents an interesting
candidate gene for chronic inflammatory diseases such as sle
because of its important role in inflammatory and immunological processes. our research is the first study examining the
association of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs with sle, although  xxxg1081xxx  has been
identified as a key molecule for autoimmune diseases for some
time.
cnvs have been clearly shown to have the potential to
influence, directly or indirectly, a healthy individual’s susceptibility to disease, for example by varying the gene dosage of
certain disease-causing genes.7–9 in our study, we found that
increased, but not decreased, copy numbers of  xxxg1081xxx  were
associated with the risk of sle. this is reasonable as previous
studies indicated that signalling transduction of  xxxg1081xxx  is
essential in the inflammatory response. it is expected that the

phenotypic effects of cnvs are supposedly brought about by
changes in expression levels.33,34 in our study, increased copy
numbers of  xxxg1081xxx  correlated with the elevated mrna levels.
in general, the  xxxg1081xxx  expression level is rather low and may
be regulated by inflammatory stimuli.17 upregulation of  xxxg1081xxx 
may result in a stronger response to histamine, and subsequently induce inflammatory cell accumulation. the significance of  xxxg1081xxx  cnvs was further proved by their association
with several diagnostic criteria used in sle. incidence of
arthritis or abnormalities of proteinuria and antinuclear antibodies, which all reflect the extent and severity of the autoimmune response, were found to positively correlate with  xxxg1081xxx 
cnvs.
histamine has been recognized to play a role in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, which is characterized mainly by synovial tissue inflammation leading to
erosion and destruction of articular cartilage with subsequent
joint deformity. the amine has been regarded as a proinflammatory mediator in arthritic disease,18,20 and the considerable
variations in  xxxg1081xxx  expression in human synovial cells may be

related to the severity and duration of rheumatoid arthritis.19
the localization of  xxxg1081xxx  in synovial and vascular wall cells of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis18 and the identification of
 xxxg1081xxx  in fibroblast and macrophage-like cells from rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue20 further supports the contribution of the receptor in the pathophysiology of the disease.
moreover, mast cells are also thought to play a role in
rheumatoid arthritis.35 they are found in synovial fluid from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis and there appears to be a
correlation between mast cell density and inflammation
score.36–38 in our case, the increased copy numbers of  xxxg1081xxx 
may lead to the upregulation of  xxxg1081xxx  expression in synovial
cells and mast cells, thus correlating with the increased incidence of arthritis in patients with sle. abnormalities of kidney
function (such as proteinuria) are usually observed in patients
with sle. although there are few (if any) data in the literature
on the role of  xxxg1081xxx  in kidney abnormalities, it is very likely
that certain immune cell types (e.g. mast cells and t cells)
present in the kidney may also be affected by  xxxg1081xxx , as supported by our findings.

in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that genetic
variations in  xxxg1081xxx  copy numbers contribute to the pathogenesis
of sle. therapeutic targeting of  xxxg1081xxx  has already been
suggested as a promising new opportunity to modulate autoimmune diseases such as arthritis rheumatology.39 the implication of the role of  xxxg1081xxx  in sle might help in the identification
of new candidates for therapeutic targeting of sle. also, the information about cnvs of the  xxxg1081xxx  gene may provide a potential
criterion for diagnosis of sle, or help to define the population
with a high susceptibility to sle. in the future, it would be
interesting to determine how cnvs of  xxxg1081xxx  are related to the
susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases.

what’s already known about this topic?
