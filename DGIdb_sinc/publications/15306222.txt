1. introduction
the increased sympathetic activity in chronic heart failure
(chf) is a compensatory adaptation to the initial disease
stage that eventually damages the myocardium and vascular
smooth muscle via stimulation of adrenergic receptors (ars)
and other neurohormonal and inflammatory signaling pathabbreviations: [125i]heat, (f)-h-([125i]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl-tetralone; [3h]rx821002, (1,4-[6,7(n)-3h]benzodioxan-2methoxy-2-yl)-2-imidazoline hydrochloride; gpp(nh)p, 5v-guanylylimidodiphosphate

ways [1]. the ars consist of three distinct subclasses,
namely, h- (h1, 2, and 3), a1- (a1a, 1b, and 1d), and a2(a2a, 2b, and 2c) ars [2,3]. several randomized clinical
studies on chf using subtype nonselective a1-adrenergic
blockers, such as  xxxd3000xxx  and doxazosin, failed to show
efficacy compared to placebo or low-dose diuretics [4,5].
because both  xxxd3000xxx  and doxazosin were shown to have
proapoptotic properties on cardiac myocytes [6], the therapeutic efficacy of blocking a1-ars without the apoptotic
effect has not been determined.
conversely, treatment with carvedilol, a blocker of both hand a1-ars with antioxidant effects, was significantly beneficial for chf in several randomized clinical trials [7– 10].
especially, a recently completed carvedilol or metoprolol

background: increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of a1- and h-adrenergic receptors (ars),
provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective a1-ar blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. it is,
however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct a1-adrenergic receptors (a1-ars). methods and
results: we determined binding properties of human ars for carvedilol using hek293 human embryonic kidney cells expressing a single
ar subtype. our results showed that the affinities of a1d-ar and a1b-ar for carvedilol are higher than that of the h1-ar subtype, a major
target in heart failure treatment. the affinity rank order and pki values of ars for carvedilol were as follows: a1d-ar (8.9) > a1b-ar
(8.6) > 1-ar (8.4) > h2-ar (8.0) > a1a-ar (7.9)ha2c-ar (5.9) > a2b-ar (5.5) > a2a-ar (5.3). furthermore, temporal kinetics of
intracellular calcium signaling mediated via a1d- and a1b-ars, but not via a1a-ar ( p < 0.01), showed oscillatory patterns with
frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 per minute in human smooth muscle and hek293 cells, which were inhibited by the therapeutic
concentrations of carvedilol (10 nm) in a subtype-dependent manner. when oscillatory a1b-ar and non-oscillatory a1a-ar were coexpressed and heteromer receptors were detected with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, carvedilol
suppressed only oscillatory component of global cytosolic free calcium change. conclusions: these results indicate that in addition to hars, receptor inhibition by carvedilol is directed to a1-ars, preferably to a1d- and a1b-ar-mediated signaling events, including
intracellular calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle.

2. experimental procedures
2.1. materials
cdnas for human h1-, h2-, a2a-, a2b-, and a2c-ars
were kind gifts from dr. robert j. lefkowitz (duke university). the cdnas for h1- and h2-ars that have an aminoterminal epitope tag for hemagglutinin protein were kindly
provided by dr. hitoshi kurose (kyushu university) [18].
characterization of cdnas for human a1a-, a1b-, and a1dars was described previously [19]. carvedilol and kmd3213 dihydrobromide were kindly provided by daiichi
pharmaceutical (tokyo, japan) and kissei pharmaceutical
(matsumoto, japan), respectively.
2.2. expression constructs
receptor cdnas were subcloned into a mammalian
expression vector, pcdna1.3 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca),
at xhoi/kpni (a1a-, a1b-, a1d-, a2a-, a2b-, and a2cars) or at ecori/bamhi (h1- and h2-ars) sites.
2.3. cell culture and transfection
hek293 human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100
ag/ml streptomycin. human aortic smooth muscle cells

(aosm cells) were cultured according to the supplier’s
instruction (cambrex, east rutherford, nj). the expression
constructs (4.5 ag dna) were transfected into the cells
grown in a 10-cm tissue culture dish by cationic lipid method
using lipofectamine plus (invitrogen). to obtain stable cell
lines expressing each a1-ar, transfected cells were dispersed
at 5  105 cells/10 cm tissue culture dish, and zeocin (0.5 mg/
ml) was included in the culture medium. cloned stable cell
lines were maintained in culture medium containing 0.2 mg/
ml zeocin.
2.4. membrane preparation and binding study
cellular membrane fraction was prepared as described
[20] and stored at 80 jc in buffer b (50 mm tris –hcl, 1
mm edta, ph 7.4). for detection of a1-, a2-, and h-ars,
[125i]heat (2200 ci/mmol, perkin elmer life sciences,
boston, ma), [3h]rx821002 (54 ci/mmol, amersham
biosciences, piscataway, nj), and [3h]cgp12177 (33 ci/
mmol, amersham biosciences) were used, respectively.
there was no detectable specific binding of these radioligands to wild-type hek cells.
binding studies were performed as described previously
[20– 23]. for saturation binding study, 50– 1000 pm of
[125i]heat, 25 – 3200 pm of [3h]rx821002, or 12.5 –
1600 pm of [3h]cgp12177 were used. because buffer
composition, especially concentrations of mgcl2 and nacl,
affects antagonist binding to a2-ars [24], binding studies
of a2-ars were performed in buffer b containing 140 mm
nacl and 100 am gpp(nh)p [21]. specific radioligand
binding was determined from the difference between counts
in the presence or absence of 10 am  xxxd2914xxx  (a1- and
a2-ars) or of 10 am propranolol (h-ars).
2.5. measurement of intracellular calcium transients
hek 293 cells stably expressing a1-ars were tested for
their ability to mobilize calcium using a fluorescent intracellular calcium assay kit (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca) and a fluorescence-imaging plate reader (flipr) system (molecular devices) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. for dye loading cells in 100 al hank’s/hepes
buffer (145 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 0.5 mm cacl2, 1 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, and 10 mm glucose, ph 7.4)
containing flipr calcium assay reagents were incubated
for 1 h at 37 jc in black 96-well viewplates (polyfiltronics,
rockland, me). basal [ca2 +]i conditions were monitored
for 10 s before adding 50 al of the agonist with an integrated
96-well pipetter. fluorescence was measured from all 96
wells simultaneously using a charge-coupled device camera.
concentration– response curves were calculated as percentage of maximum response (emax) induced by 10 am
phenylephrine. agonist potency was expressed as pd2
( log ec50) value.
single-cell [ca2 +]i measurements were performed as
described previously [25]. the wild-type hek293 cells

european trial (comet) study, which was the first mortality
study comparing two h blocking agents in patients with chf,
showed a significant improvement in survival rate in the
carvedilol arm when compared to metoprolol, a h1-selective
blocker [11].
although efficacy of carvedilol might be mainly attributable to its h-blocking effect [12,13], it has not been conclusively demonstrated whether the a1-ar blockade by
carvedilol could have an additional benefit for chf. our
focus in this study is to evaluate the subtype-specific inhibitory potencies of carvedilol against recombinant human ars
to clarify the preferential receptor subtypes for this drug.
specifically, emphasis is on the subtype selectivity of carvedilol relative to the a1-ars. the three a1-ar subtypes,
which couple to gq type of g protein and the phospholipase
c pathway, have different tissue and subcellular distributions, intracellular signaling cascades, and transcriptional
profiles [14]. in arterial smooth muscle cells, these subtypes
are frequently co-expressed and formation of homo- and
hetero-oligomer a1-ars is proposed [15 –17]. our results
revealed that a1d- and a1b-ar-dependent intracellular
calcium signaling, which causes oscillatory changes in the
intracellular calcium concentration ([ca2 +]i), is more susceptible to inhibition by carvedilol than the calcium signaling
caused by the a1a-ar. therefore, a1-ars show subtypedependent sensitivity to carvedilol.

and aosm cells did not show any [ca2 +]i change when
stimulated with 10 am phenylephrine (data not shown).
2.6. measurement of biological resonance energy transfer

2.7. immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
the flag epitope was inserted between the initial
methionine residue and the second amino acids of the a1ars by pcr. the 5v-primer sequence contained 6 bases of
xhoi site, optimized translation sequence, 3 bases for methionine, 24 bases encoding the flag-peptide sequence, and
21 bases encoding 7 amino acids next to initiator methionine.
immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously [25], using anti-flag m2 antibody
(kodak, rochester, ny) and anti-gfp antibody (mbl,

2.8. calculations
all values in the text are reported as mean f s.d. significant differences, with p < 0.05 were determined by one-way
anova with newman – keuls multiple comparison test.
concentration –response relationships were fitted to a fourparameter logistic equation using a nonlinear curve-fitting
program, which derives the ec50 and hill’s values (igor,
wavemetrics, lake oswego, or). calcium recordings were
done in 10 –50 cells simultaneously, and each experiment
was repeated three or more times to ensure the reproducibility of the findings.

3. results
3.1. affinities of human adrenergic receptors for carvedilol
specific radioligand binding sites of a1-, a2-, and h-ars
were detected in the transfected hek293 cells, but not in the
wild-type cells, by [ 125 i]heat, [ 3 h]rx821002, and
[3h]cgp12177, respectively. the kd values obtained in
saturation binding experiments were in good agreement with
those previously reported for recombinant and native human
ars and listed in table 1 [20 –23,28]. in competition binding
experiments using membrane preparations from cells
expressing each a1-ar, carvedilol was moderately selective
for the a1b- and a1d-ar subtypes compared to the a1a-ar
(fig. 1a). thus, a tenfold difference was detected in the ki
values between the a1d- and a1a-ars (1.2 and 12 nm,
respectively, fig. 1 and table 1). notably, the affinities of
a1b- and a1d-ars for carvedilol were higher than any other

the cdnas for the a1-ars were connected in-frame with
either yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) or renilla luciferase
(rluc) gene to detect receptor– receptor interactions. the
native stop codons of a1-ars were changed to kpni
restriction enzyme site and genes for a variant yfp, ‘‘venus’’
(f64l/m153t/v163a/s175g) [26], and for rluc with optimized codons for mammalian expression (promega) were
connected, resulting in two amino acid insertions of glycine
and asparagine between the receptor and yfp or luciferase.
all fusion constructs were sequenced and transferred to
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen). the additions of amino- or carboxy-terminal tags to the a1-ars had no significant effect
on their binding and intracellular signalings [27].
for biological resonance energy transfer (bret) assays,
transfected cells growing on a 10-cm culture dish were
collected in pbs containing 1 mm edta and suspended
in hank’s/hepes buffer at 1  106/ml. after addition of
coelenterazine h (promega) at a final concentration of 5 am,
luminescence was detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (f-2500, hitachi, tokyo, japan). the bret signal
was determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted
by the receptor-yfp at 535 nm to the light emitted by the
receptor-rluc at 480 nm. background signal determined
prior to the addition of coelenterazine h was always less
than 1% of measured values and was subtracted.

ars including h1-ar and h2-ar (fig. 1b and table 1). in
contrast, a2-ars showed weak binding to carvedilol with ki
values in the micromolar range (fig. 1c).

respectively. in spite of the distinct cellular localizations,
activities of all a1-ars were effectively controlled by
carvedilol.

3.2. inhibition of a1-ar-mediated intracellular responses
by carvedilol

3.3. single-cell calcium responses of a1-ars

the effects of high affinity binding of carvedilol to a1dand a1b-ar subtypes were further examined by stimulating
cells in the presence and absence of therapeutic concentrations of carvedilol (1 – 10 nm) and measuring averaged
[ca2 +]i with a fluorescence-imaging plate reader. when
hek cells stably expressing a1-ars were stimulated with
phenylephrine or norepinephrine, [ca2 +]i increased in a
concentration-dependent manner with pd2 values listed in
table 2. the relationships between agonist concentrations
and peak amplitudes in [ca2 +]i were shifted toward the right
in the presence of carvedilol or  xxxd2914xxx , keeping same
maximum amplitudes (fig. 2a and b). the calculated pa2
values of carvedilol upon norepinephrine stimulation were
9.0, 10, and 10.2 for a1a-, a1b-, and a1d-ars, respectively (table 2). therefore, carvedilol is a competitive
inhibitor with graded inhibitory potencies against three a1ars. when expressed in hek cells, each a1-ar tagged
with gfp shows specific patterns of cellular localization, as
seen in fig. 2c; a1a-ar-gfp localized at both cell surface
and intracellular part, while a1b-ar-gfp and a1d-argfp were seen mostly at cell surface and at intracellular part,

we next searched for an intracellular signaling pathway in aosm cells, which could show specificity among

fig. 2. carvedilol inhibited [ca2 +]i responses in a concentration-dependent manner in cells expressing a1-ars. hek293 cells stably expressing each a1-ar

a1-ar subtypes and exhibit a different sensitivity to
carvedilol. in aosm cells, specific binding of [125i]heat
or [3h]rx821002 was not detectable prior to transfection
procedure. thus, no functional expression of native a-ar
subtypes was observed in our culture condition. when each
a1-ar subtype was transiently transfected, total binding
sites of [125i]heat for a1a-ar, a1b-ar, and a1-ar
were 256 f 20 (n = 3), 138 f 8 (n = 3), and 271 f 47 (n = 3)
fmol/mg protein, respectively, while no specific binding
sites of [3h]rx821002 were detected in these transfected
cells.
in fura-2 loaded aosm cells expressing a1a-ar, a
submaximal concentration of 10 am phenylephrine
evoked a [ca2 +]i increase of spike and plateau pattern
(fig. 3a). in contrast, oscillatory patterns of [ca2 +]i
changes were observed in 78% (n = 119) and 91%
(n = 156) of cells expressing a1b- and a1d-ars, respec-

tively, while only 4% (n = 203) in a1a-ar expressing
cells showed oscillation in [ca2 +]i. the oscillation frequencies in the cells expressing a1b-ar and a1d-ar
had no significant difference, ranging between 0.3 and 3
per minute. the a1a-ar-mediated repetitive [ca2 +]i
change maintained a high basal [ca2 +]i level during
oscillations, while those seen in a1b- and a1d-arexpressing cells returned to basal [ca2 +]i between oscillations (fig. 3a). the differences in the [ca2 +]i response
patterns among the a1-ars were well preserved in
hek293 cells separately transfected with each a1-ar
subtype (fig. 3b). therefore, distinct oscillatory and
non-oscillatory [ca2 +]i changes induced by a1-ars are
not specific to the smooth muscle cells and can occur in a
nonexcitable cell type such as hek cells. phenylephrineinduced [ca2 +]i changes in both aosm cells and hek
cells were efficiently suppressed by preincubation of cells

with 10 am  xxxd2914xxx , while atp (100 am)-induced
calcium responses were not affected (fig. 3c and d).
3.4. the effect of carvedilol on the subtype-dependent
single-cell calcium responses of a1-ars
we next examined an effect of carvedilol treatment on
the single-cell calcium response patterns. the peak [ca2 +]i
amplitudes induced by 10 am phenylephrine gradually
decreased with increasing carvedilol concentrations used
in all cell types (fig. 4a). in a1b- and a1d-ar expressing
cells, spiking frequencies, in addition to the amplitudes,
were significantly lowered by carvedilol (fig. 4a). these
inhibitory effects were partially overcome by increasing
agonist concentration to 100 am in cells expressing a1bar (fig. 4b) and a1d-ar (not shown). in contrast to
phenylephrine, a partial agonist at all of the human a1-ars
[29], stimulation with submaximal concentration (10 am)

of norepinephrine, a full agonist for a1-ars, resulted in
high oscillatory frequencies in both a1b- and a1d-arexpressing cells and [ca2 +]i did not decrease to the basal
resting level during oscillations (fig. 4c). preincubation of
the cells with 10 nm carvedilol and stimulation with
norepinephrine resulted in a return to the large oscillatory
pattern (fig. 4c). in contrast, carvedilol treatment in a1aar-expressing cells did not increase fraction of cells
showing the oscillatory [ca2 +]i response. these results
indicate that a1d- and a1b-ars evoke oscillatory patterns
of [ca2 +]i mobilization, the frequencies of which could be
modulated by both agonist potencies and antagonist concentrations at single-cell level.
3.5. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by carvedilol
we further examined the effects of blocking each a1-ar
on phenylephrine-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, which

fig. 4. the a1-ar-mediated single-cell [ca2 +]i responses are dependent on antagonist concentrations. (a) hek cells expressing a1-ars were stimulated with
10 am of phenylephrine in the presence of increasing concentrations of carvedilol. (b) oscillatory responses were recovered by higher concentration (100 am)
of phenylephrine and norepinephrine even in the presence of 100 nm carvedilol in cells expressing a1b-ar. (c) stimulation with 10 am norepinephrine in the
absence (upper) and presence (lower) of 10 nm carvedilol in hek cells expressing a1b-and a1d-ars. the frequency of oscillation varied in each cell and

are related to cellular growth and hypertrophy. as shown in
fig. 5, carvedilol (100 nm), as well as  xxxd2914xxx  (1 am),
significantly inhibited these  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylations.
when signals with phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 specific antibody were
normalized by total  xxxg1369xxx /2 amount,  xxxg1369xxx /2 was phosphorylated more effectively in smooth muscle cells transiently expressing a1b- or a1d-ars than in cells expressing
a1a-ar (fig. 5b).

3.6. the effect of carvedilol on cells co-expressing a1-ar
subtypes
because different a1-ar subtypes are frequently coexpressed in the same vascular smooth muscle [14], we
examined subtype selectivity of carvedilol on cells coexpressing different a1-ars. when yfp-tagged a1b-ar
and rluc-tagged receptors were co-expressed, significant

mg protein and kd value 335 f 89 nm (n = 3). fractions of
high and low affinity binding sites, which were detected
by an a1a-ar-specific antagonist, kmd-3213, were
45 f 7% and 55 f 7%, respectively (n = 4), as shown in
fig. 7a. the pki values of a1a- and a1b-ars for kmd3213 were 8.0 f 0.1 and 6.8 f 0.1 (n = 4), respectively,
and those of high and low affinity sites in co-expressed
cells were 8.2 f 0.1 and 7.0 f 0.1 (n = 3), respectively.
stimulation of these cells with 10 am phenylephrine
caused oscillatory calcium response with gradually decreasing basal [ca2 +]i. when 10 nm carvedilol was added
in the external buffer and present throughout the measurement, [ca2 +]i response changed to single spike without

carvedilol. (a) transiently transfected aosm cells were stimulated with 10
am phenylephrine for 5 min and collected in lysis buffer. equal amounts
(20-ag protein) of samples were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotting for the analysis of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation using phosphospecific
(thr202/tyr204) antibody. the blots were then stripped and reprobed with
 xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody. carvedilol (100 nm) and  xxxd2914xxx  (1 am) were
incubated for 10 min prior to the stimulations. representative data from
four experiments are presented. (b) signal intensities of phosphorylated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 were normalized with intensities of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 and the
mean f s.d. are shown (n = 4). *p < 0.05, compared to cells treated with
carvedilol or  xxxd2914xxx .

increases of the bret signal occurred in all combinations
of a1-ar subtypes, compared to the cells co-expressing
receptor-yfp and rluc or to the cells expressing yfp and
receptor-rluc (fig. 6a). these results suggested that when
co-expressed, a1-ars could form homomers and heterooligomers. the co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction between a1b-ar and other subtypes
(fig. 6b). in both bret and co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, a1b-ar interacted to yfp-tagged and rluctagged a1-ars with preference to a1d-ar and a1b-ar
over a1a-ar (fig. 6a and b).
we then focused our analysis on the cells co-expressing
a1a-ar and a1b-ar, which cause two distinct [ca2 +]i
kinetics. in cells stably expressing a1a-ar that transiently expressed a1b-ar-yfp, [125i]heat, a subtype nonse-

(left panel) and anti-flag antibody (right upper panel). expression levels
of gfp-tagged receptors were also examined (right lower panel).

oscillation (fig. 7b). thus, among the homo- and heterooligomeric receptors formed in the cells co-expressing
a1a-ar and a1b-ar subtypes, carvedilol effectively
inhibited the receptors responsible for the oscillatory
component of complex [ca2 +]i response.

fig. 7. calcium responses of cells co-expressing a1a- and a1b-ars. (a)
competition binding studies using kmd-3213, an a1a-selective antagonist,
were performed with membrane preparations from hek cells expressing
a1a- or a1b-ar (upper) and both a1a- and a1b-ars (lower). nonspecific
binding was determined in the presence of 10 am  xxxd2914xxx . data
presented are the mean from single experiment performed in triplicate.
similar results were obtained from three additional experiments. (b) coexpressed cells were stimulated with 10 am phenylephrine in the absence
(upper) and presence (lower) of 10 nm carvedilol. traces are representative
of 58 cells (upper) and 71 cells (lower) from three experiments.

recombinant expression of each ar subtype enabled us
to delineate a series of inhibitory potencies of carvedilol in
the adrenergic system. thus, the binding affinities of carvedilol for a1d- and a1b-ars were comparable to that for
h1-ar and were more potent than those for h2-ar and
a1a-ar subtypes. several meta-analysis and comet
study for chf showed consistent benefit of combined a1and h-ar blockade by carvedilol [11,30]. it was also
reported that carvedilol lowered coronary sinus norepinephrine levels, an index of cardiac adrenergic activity, whereas
metoprolol actually increased central venous norepinephrine
levels [31]. although the mechanism whereby carvedilol
lowers norepinephrine levels needs to be further investigated, findings from a1d-ar knockout mice suggested that
ablating the function of this subtype attenuates the elevation
of plasma norepinephrine level during the development of
hypertension accompanied with renal failure [32]. when
bucindolol, a nonselective h-ar blocker with only weak
a1-ar blocking activity, was used for chf in h-blocker
evaluation of survival trial, it increased the combined
endpoints of death or heart failure hospitalization within
the first 6 months and did not result in overall benefit [33].
although patient populations and severity of the disease
differ in each chf trial, these results indicate that ar types,
which are selected for a pharmacological intervention, could
have a significant impact on the final outcome of chf
treatment.
previous pharmacokinetics data suggested that 25 and 50
mg oral administration of carvedilol produced peak plasma
levels of 150 and 300 nm, respectively, and about 95% of
carvedilol was found to bind to plasma proteins [34]. these
plasma concentrations indicate that blockade of a1- and hars by carvedilol could occur in a linear range of the
competition binding curve and that ligand binding to a2ars could be largely preserved. however, in examining
ligand affinities using recombinant receptors and translating
these results to efficacy estimation of agonist and antagonist
in vivo, care should be taken for potential difference in
cellular environment, which might influence receptor functions. in addition, there is species difference in relative
affinities of carvedilol to a1- and h-ars. by using vascular
preparation from pithed rat, ruffolo et al. [35] found that kb
values of h- and a1-ars for carvedilol were 0.9 and 11 nm,
respectively. on the other hand, bristow et al. [36] used
membrane preparations from human ventricular myocardium for radioligand assay and found that ki values of h1and a1-ars for carvedilol were 4.5 and 8.1 nm, respectively. thus, the ratios of h1-ar/a1-ar blocking activities
of carvedilol are 12 and 1.7 for rat and human receptors,
respectively. the reason for lower affinity rank order of a1ar than the h1-ar in human heart is based on the fact that
main cardiac a1-ar subtype has been reported to be the
a1a-ar subtype, although the exact amount of each a1-ar
protein has not been examined [37]. therefore, binding

supported with clinical evidence could be valuable and

affinities calculated in our study using recombinant human
ars should provide basic knowledge for understanding
affinities of native ars against carvedilol.
the a1-ars in the peripheral vasculature play a major
role in positively regulating arterial vascular tone [15]. gene
targeting for each of the a1-ar subtype further revealed
that deletion of one subtype gene was directly correlated to
the attenuated pressor response to an a1-ar agonist administered intravenously [38 – 40]. therefore, there was
minimal functional redundancy among the three vascular
a1-ar subtypes and blocking a specific fraction of a1-ar
had direct impact on the regulation of systemic blood
pressure.
recent clinical studies, however, indicate that efficacy of
carvedilol during chf treatment might not belong to its
ability to reduce peripheral vascular resistance. chronic
administration of carvedilol to chf patients did not increase
calf vascular conductance and did not attenuate vasoconstrictor response of forearm vasculature to adrenergic stimuli [41,42]. from these results, biological process that is
suppressed by carvedilol is not likely to be hemodynamic
change in microvasulature, but might be related to metabolic
or hypertrophic signaling to arterial smooth muscle cells via
vascular a1-ars [43]. in fact, carvedilol effectively attenuated phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. furthermore, deletion of
mouse a1b-ar gene resulted in a beneficial effect for
preventing remodeling of peripheral vessels and cardiac
muscle induced by continuous infusion of phenylephrine
at subpressor doses [44].
native arterial smooth muscle cell frequently co-expresses
distinct a1-ar subtypes [43,45], in which heteromeric receptor can be composed of different a1-ar subtypes [16,17].
receptor heteromerization between a1a- and a1b-ars
increased total receptor binding sites and internalized a1bar in response to stimulation of an a1a-ar-selective
agonist, oxymetazoline [16,17]. analysis of the heteromerspecific character at single-cell level can be confounded by
the concomitant presence of homomeric receptors. we found
that in a cell co-expressing non-oscillatory a1a-ar and
oscillatory a1b-ar subtypes to a similar extent, a pattern
of global intracellular [ca2 +]i change caused by norepinephrine or phenylephrine was fluctuating [ca2 +]i levels with
gradually decreasing basal [ca2 +]i. carvedilol was more
effective on the oscillatory component than on the nonoscillatory one.
in conclusion, the a1d- and a1b-ars show high affinities for carvedilol, which are comparable to that of h1-ar.
the oscillatory [ca2 +]i responses by a1d- and a1b-ars
are distinct from the response induced by a1a-ar and are
more susceptible to carvedilol. from the results of clinical
studies, it was concluded that subtype-nonselective anti-a1ar antagonist is not a first-line drug for the chf treatment,
while an effectiveness of a subtype-selective a1-blocker
directed against a1d- and/or a1b-ars in combination with
h-blockade needs to be further addressed in clinical and
basic research fields. thus, obtaining knowledge of the
