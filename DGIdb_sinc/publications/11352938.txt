inactivated in a cell, the inactive state of the chromosome is
clonally inherited through many rounds of cell division.
the most remarkable feature of xi chromatin is its stability with respect to reactivation. overall experimental reactivation of the entire chromosome in somatic cells has
not been observed. reactivation of one or few genes on
the xi has been seen, but the rate of reactivation is low, on
the order of 10⫺5 to 10⫺4, in cultured somatic cells (mohandas et al., 1981; graves, 1982). many lines of evidence indicate that multiple molecular mechanisms are responsible
for the high fidelity of maintenance of x inactivation (for
review see migeon, 1994), but the contribution of individual mechanisms to silencing and their complex relationship
remains to be elucidated.
methylation of cpg dinucleotides in the promoter
region of repressed genes has long been thought of as
a mechanism stabilizing x chromosome inactivation.
 xxxd1823xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg644xxx  (dnmt1),
the major enzyme responsible for maintaining genomic
methylation patterns, has been used to derepress several
xi-linked genes, providing the experimental evidence for
the importance of methylation in x inactivation (mohandas et al., 1981; graves, 1982). methylation of the cpg island of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( xxxg1075xxx )
follows x inactivation by several days, implying that methylation plays a maintenance role (lock et al., 1987). an in

in mammals, equal x-linked gene dosage between the
sexes is achieved by x chromosome inactivation in females.
the inactivated x chromosome resembles constitutive heterochromatin in that it is condensed in interphase (barr
and carr, 1962), hypoacetylated on  xxxg1052xxx  (jeppesen
and turner, 1993), and replicates late in s phase (priest et
al., 1967). it is also methylated on cpg islands of housekeeping genes (norris et al., 1991) and is enriched in histone macroh2a1, a histone h2a variant with a large nonhistone domain (costanzi and pehrson, 1998). the inactive
x (xi)1 expresses xist (borsani et al., 1991; brockdorff et
al., 1991; brown et al., 1991), a nuclear untranslated rna
(brockdorff et al., 1992) that coats the chromosome in cis
(clemson et al., 1996). both x chromosomes of an undifferentiated embryonic female cell are active, and x inactivation is initiated at the time of differentiation in vitro or in
vivo (monk and harper, 1979). once an x chromosome is

abstract. xist rna expression, methylation of cpg islands, and hypoacetylation of  xxxg1052xxx  are distinguishing features of inactive x chromatin. here, we
show that these silencing mechanisms act synergistically
to maintain the inactive state. xist rna has been shown
to be essential for initiation of x inactivation, but not required for maintenance. we have developed a system in
which the reactivation frequency of individual x-linked
genes can be assessed quantitatively. using a conditional mutant xist allele, we provide direct evidence for
that loss of xist rna destabilizes the inactive state in
somatic cells, leading to an increased reactivation fre-

ing xist rna (clemson et al., 1998; hansen et al.,
1998). furthermore, deletion of xist in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts disrupts preferential localization of histone
macroh2a1 to xi, and this alteration of chromatin may
also lead to decreased stability of silencing (csankovszki
et al., 1999).
to assess the possible role of xist rna in x inactivation
maintenance and to study the relative contribution of xist,
dna methylation, and histone hypoacetylation, we developed a system in which even low levels of reactivation can
be quantitatively measured. reactivation of two markers
on xi were studied, a green fluorescent protein (gfp)
transgene, gfp (hadjantonakis et al., 1998), and the endogenous  xxxg1075xxx  gene. using a conditional deletion of xist
(csankovszki et al., 1999), we provide direct evidence for
the first time that xist rna contributes to silencing in somatic cells. additionally, using the drugs  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd3426xxx  a (tsa) and by introducing a mutation in the
dnmt1 gene (jackson-grusby et al., 2001), we show that
xist rna, dna methylation, and histone hypoacetylation
act synergistically to achieve a highly stable inactive state.

materials and methods
mice and preparation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts
the xist2lox (csankovszki et al., 1999), the xist⌬ (marahrens et al., 1997),
the gfp mice (hadjantonakis et al., 1998), and the  xxxg1075xxx ⌬ mice (hooper et
al., 1987) have been described elsewhere. to obtain mice carrying the
gfp transgene and the xist2lox allele in cis, germline recombinants were
generated from double heterozygous females. recombination frequency
was 40% (n ⫽ 115). similarly, we obtained mice with the  xxxg1075xxx ⌬ and xist⌬
alleles in cis from mice heterozygous for both mutations in trans (27% recombination frequency, n ⫽ 81). finally, xist⌬; xxxg1075xxx ⌬/xist⫹; xxxg1075xxx ⌬ females
were mated to xist2lox; xxxg1075xxx ⫹;gfp/y males to generate xist conditional
mutant fibroblasts and xist⫹; xxxg1075xxx ⫹;gfp/y males to generate controls.
the dnmt2lox (jackson-grusby et al., 2001) and dnmts (lei et al., 1996)
mutations were bred into the colony to create xist, dnmt1 double conditional knockout fibroblasts.
primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from dissociation
and trypsinization of embryonic day 14 embryos, cultured, and when necessary immortalized with sv-40 t-antigen (jat et al., 1986). for cre-mediated recombination in fibroblasts, cells were infected with an adenovirus
vector carrying the gene for cre recombinase (anton and graham, 1995).
infection was carried out in monolayer culture in dme with 2% fetal calf
serum for 2 h. the lowest possible multiplicity of infection that yielded
100% recombination without cytotoxic effects was experimentally determined. uninfected cells were treated identically, without the addition of
virus. after infection, cells were grown in dme with 15% fetal calf serum
with antibiotics. when appropriate,  xxxd1823xxx  (sigma-aldrich) was added
to the cultures to a final concentration of 0.3 ␮m, and tsa (sigmaaldrich) to final concentration of 500 nm.

southern blotting
to analyze the efficiency of cre-mediated xist deletion, genomic dna of
infected cells was digested with xbai, blotted, and hybridized with probe
7, a 1.1-kb ecori-xbai fragment at the beginning of exon 7. to analyze
recombination at the dnmt1 locus, genomic dna was digested with spei
and hybridized with the hv probe (jackson-grusby et al., 2001). to analyze demethylation of genomic dna, an hpaii digest was performed, and
the blot was hybridized with a probe covering the gag coding region of intracisternal a particle (iap) element (nucleotides 1570–1899, sequence
data available from genbank/embl/ddbj under accession no. m17551)
(walsh et al., 1998).

vivo demonstration of the importance of cpg methylation
in x inactivation maintenance is the instability of silencing
on the xi of icf (immunodeficiency centromeric instability facial anomalies) patients. the xi of patients suffering
from icf syndrome is hypomethylated at all cpg islands
analyzed (hansen et al., 2000). the syndrome is caused
by a defect in the dna methyltransferase dnmt3b
(hansen et al., 1999; okano et al., 1999; xu et al., 1999),
suggesting that the enzyme may be responsible for establishing cpg methylation on xi. x inactivation in the virtual absence of cpg methylation is less stable, as evidenced by reactivation of some loci in cells from these
patients (hansen et al., 2000).
underacetylation of nh2-terminal lysine residues on
histones h3 and h4 is another feature of xi chromatin
(jeppesen and turner, 1993). it is well established that
transcriptional activity of genes is regulated by histone
acetylation. histone deacetylation generally correlates
with transcriptional silencing and high levels of acetylation
with transcriptional activity (cheung et al., 2000). however, reactivation of x-inactivated genes by altering histone acetylation levels has not been reported. the appearance of a hypoacetylated x chromosome is a late event
during differentiation and x inactivation, suggesting that
deacetylation of histones is a maintenance rather than establishment mechanism (keohane et al., 1996).
xist rna is essential for the initiation of x chromosome inactivation in cis (penny et al., 1996; marahrens et
al., 1997). however, several lines of evidence indicate that
after x inactivation has been established, xist is no longer
required for maintenance. in studies using mouse–human
somatic cell hybrids, a human xi chromosome fragment
that lacked the xist gene remained transcriptionally silent and its sensitivity to reactivation by  xxxd1823xxx  did not
increase (brown and willard, 1994). similarly, in human
leukemia cells, an xi-derived isodicentric chromosome
maintained its inactive state despite missing the xist gene
(rack et al., 1994). to directly address the role of continued xist rna expression in karyotypically normal somatic
cells, we have previously generated a conditional xist allele (csankovszki et al., 1999) using the cre-loxp system
(sauer and henderson, 1988). after cre-mediated deletion of xist in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the xi
remained silent (csankovszki et al., 1999), again arguing
that, in the absence of xist rna, other silencing mechanisms are sufficient to keep xi silent. another study used
embryonic stem cells expressing an inducible xist cdna
transgene, in which the timing of expression can be experimentally manipulated (wutz and jaenisch, 2000). this approach defined an initial differentiation time window in
which x inactivation is reversible and xist dependent, followed by irreversible and xist-independent x inactivation
in fully differentiated cells (wutz and jaenisch, 2000).
nevertheless, continued transcription of xist rna and
its close association with xi throughout the lifetime of the
female mammal suggests a role for xist in somatic cells
(clemson et al., 1996). indeed, in rodent–human somatic
cell hybrids where the human xist rna does not localize correctly to xi (clemson et al., 1998; hansen et al.,
1998), the stability of silencing is greatly reduced. it has
been speculated that reduced efficiency of silencing in
hybrid cells is due to the absence of correctly function-

ml. viable cells were gated using scatter properties and exclusion of  xxxd3027xxx . 100,000–500,000 cells were analyzed for each bulk sample
and 10,000 cells for poorly growing hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine
(hat)–resistant clones. to isolate gfp-positive clones, single gfp-positive cells were sorted into wells of a 96-well plate containing dme with
15% fetal calf serum. after 2 wk, 20–30% of the wells contained fibroblast
clones, of which ⵑ30% were gfp-positive or contained a high percentage
of gfp-positive cells.

hat selection and calculation
of reactivation frequencies
for selection of clones carrying a reactivated  xxxg1075xxx  gene, the appropriate
number of cells were plated and selected in 1⫻ esq hat (stratagene)
containing media for 14 d. after selection, hat-resistant clones were
picked into regular media. for counting the number of hat-resistant
clones, plates were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and stained with giemsa. for luria-delbrück fluctuation analysis (luria and delbrück,
1943), small independent fibroblast cultures were expanded to the appropriate size, plated at a density equivalent of a 1:9 to 1:6 split in hat containing medium, and selected, fixed, and stained as above. reactivation
rates were calculated according to the p0 method of luria and delbrück
(1943) (rate ⫽ ⫺ln[proportion of negative cultures]/average culture size).

genotypes of xist conditional mutant and control fibroblasts.
both cell types are phenotypically gfp negative and hat sensitive, as the gfp transgene and the only functional  xxxg1075xxx  allele are
on the xi and are inactivated (i). conditional mutant cells carry
the xist2lox allele on xi, whereas controls carry a wild-type xist
allele. (c) cre-mediated deletion of xist after adenovirus-cre infection. southern blotting of xbai-digested dna hybridized
with probe 7 (pr7) indicates 100% recombination in primary (1⬚)
and sv-40 t-antigen–immortalized (tag) cells.

to study the stability of silencing on xi, we generated fibroblasts with two xi-linked markers, where reactivation
was designed to be detectable even at low frequencies.
one marker was an x-linked gfp transgene that is subject to x inactivation (hadjantonakis et al., 1998). when
the gfp transgene was located on xi, cells were gfp negative and reactivation could be monitored using facs®
analysis. the insertion site of the transgene was determined by dna fish, and gfp was mapped to a position
near the centromere (fig. 1 a, and see fig. 5 a). the second marker was the endogenous x-linked  xxxg1075xxx  gene, the
activity of which is required in order to survive in hat
containing medium. when cells carrying a wild-type  xxxg1075xxx 
allele on xi and a mutant allele,  xxxg1075xxx ⌬ (hooper et al.,
1987), on the active x (xa) are subjected to hat selection, even a few reactivants in a large population can be
isolated. to generate a homogeneous population of cells
with defined xa and xi chromosomes, a null mutation in
the xist gene, xist⌬ (marahrens et al., 1997), was introduced onto the chromosome carrying  xxxg1075xxx ⌬. since the
xist⌬ allele cannot be chosen for x inactivation (marah-

rens et al., 1998), cells with genotype  xxxg1075xxx ⫹;gfp/xist⌬;
 xxxg1075xxx ⌬ carry the gfp transgene and the  xxxg1075xxx ⫹ allele on xi.
to study the effect of deletion of xist from xi, a conditional allele of the gene xist2lox (csankovszki et al., 1999)
was introduced onto the chromosome. cells with genotype
xist2lox; xxxg1075xxx ⫹;gfp/xist⌬; xxxg1075xxx ⌬ will be referred to as conditional mutants. control cells with genotype xist⫹; xxxg1075xxx ⫹;
gfp/xist⌬; xxxg1075xxx ⌬ lack the xist2lox allele, and therefore cannot delete the xist gene (fig. 1 b). to induce cre-mediated deletion of xist2lox, we infected cells with an adenovirus carrying the gene encoding cre recombinase (anton
and graham, 1995). an xist2lox to xist1lox recombination
was observed in 100% of the cells, as assayed by southern
blotting (fig. 1 c). conditional mutants and controls were
treated identically, and infections and all further analyses
were done in triplicate. cre-mediated deletion of xist took
place over a period of 2–3 d, and xist rna levels were undetectable by day 4 (csankovszki et al., 1999; data not
shown). in a previous study, we showed that deletion of

were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and dropped onto slides. slides
were denatured in 70% formamide/2⫻ ssc at 70–74°c for 2 min. brdu
signal was detected using a monoclonal anti-brdu antibody (becton
dickinson) followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti–mouse antibody
(vector laboratories) in blocking buffer (1⫻ pbs, 5% goat serum, 0.2%
tween, 0.2% fish skin gelatin). slides were washed in 1⫻ pbs/0.2%
tween, dehydrated, and used for dna fish without further denaturation of the chromosomes. the xi was identified with a directly labeled
gfp/pgk-puro probe. the inserts of egfp-n1 plasmid (clontech
laboratories, inc.), and ppgkpuro were isolated, pooled, and labeled
with cy3-dctp (amersham pharmacia biotech) using random priming.
using only the gfp insert as a probe yielded identical results, but the signals were weaker. only results obtained with the gfp/pgk-puro probe
are shown. hybridization of the probe and washing were performed as described (panning and jaenisch, 1996).

xist in mouse embryonic fibroblasts does not interfere
with late replication timing and underacetylation of  xxxg1052xxx  residues, but it disrupts preferential localization
of histone macroh2a1 to xi (csankovszki et al., 1999).

analysis was performed at various time points after adenoviruscre infection. although initially we observed an increase in the

reach the level of spontaneous reactivation and remained at that
level for the duration of the experiment.

experiments were performed in sv-40 t-antigen–immortalized cells. two million cells were plated and selected in

stained to count the number of colonies (fig. 3 a). very
few (⬍1/plate) colonies were seen on control plates and on
plates containing conditional mutant fibroblasts before
cre-mediated xist, indicating that the spontaneous reactivation frequency of  xxxg1075xxx  is very low. however, after dele-

gfp expression was analyzed using facs® in xist mutant
and control cells that were infected with adenovirus-cre
or left untreated. gfp fluorescence was compared with
autofluorescence, and cells showing greater gfp fluorescence than autofluorescence were counted as positive. we
found that the number of cells expressing gfp was dependent on cell density and both the number of cells expressing gfp and the intensity of fluorescence decreased upon
long term culture (data not shown). therefore, care was
taken to ensure that an equal number of cells were plated
for each sample and cells from the same early passage
were used for each experiment. results of a typical experiment are shown in fig. 2. fibroblasts not containing the
gfp transgene (genotype ⫹/y) were negative, whereas
over 99.9% of cells with gfp on xa (gfp/y) were positive. the majority of cells with gfp on xi were also gfp
negative with a small number of positives, ⵑ10–20 in
100,000, representing the spontaneous reactivation frequency (fig. 2 a). in primary xist conditional mutant fibroblasts after cre-mediated deletion of xist, the number
of gfp-positive cells increased about twofold (fig. 2 b).
this increase cannot be attributed to the effect of adenovirus infection, as the number of gfp-positive cells did not
increase in control cells after viral infection. although the
effect is small, we consider it significant as we consistently
detected a twofold difference in gfp expressing cells between mutant and control cells in five independent repetitions of the assay.
we considered the possibility that allowing the cells to
go through many rounds of cell division in the absence of
xist will lead to an increased number of cells reactivating
gfp. to test this hypothesis, we derived permanent cell
lines by sv-40 t-antigen transformation and cultured the
cells for over 2 mo. gfp expression was analyzed at various time points (fig. 2 c). 7 d after adenoviral infection,
the transformed cells behaved similarly to primary cells:
the conditional mutants exhibited a two- to threefold increase in the number of gfp-positive cells after cre-mediated deletion of xist, whereas there was no difference between infected and uninfected control cells. however, by
day 14 after infection, the difference between the infected
and uninfected mutant cells disappeared, and the proportion of gfp-positive cells remained unchanged for ⬎2 mo.
reactivated gfp alleles are likely subject to resilencing,
consistent with our observations that gfp expression declines over time and with earlier studies that showed that
this transgene is subject to nonspecific silencing, even
when carried on xa (eggan et al., 2000). in addition, it is
possible that reactivation of x-inactivated genes confers
selective disadvantage on the cells leading to a decrease in
the number of gfp-positive cells over time (see below).
next, we analyzed reactivation of an endogenous x-inactivated gene,  xxxg1075xxx , by subjecting cells to selection in hat
medium. since hat-resistant colonies from rare reacti-

tion of xist, a small but significant number of cells reactivated  xxxg1075xxx , and xist mutant cultures yielded ⵑ30–70 hatresistant colonies per plate. the proportion of hat-resistant cell in the population increased for the first 4 wk in
culture indicating ongoing reactivation of  xxxg1075xxx . furthermore, hat-resistant cells were detected even after 3 mo in
culture (fig. 3 b). northern analysis of total rna indicated that different clones transcribed different amounts of
 xxxg1075xxx  rna (data not shown). we conclude that deletion of
xist leads to an increased, albeit low, frequency of reactivation of an endogenous x-inactivated gene,  xxxg1075xxx , indicating
that xist rna contributes to stabilizing the inactive state
in the maintenance phase of x inactivation.

x chromosomes with reactivated genes
remain late replicating
an xi chromosome after deletion of xist remains late replicating when analyzed in bulk population with presumably very few of the cells containing reactivated genes
(csankovszki et al., 1999). we wished to see whether in
the reactivated clones, xi, or a cytologically visible portion
of it, became early replicating. we analyzed two slowgrowing hat-resistant clones with a high proportion of
gfp-positive cells and one gfp-positive clone that was
also hat resistant. as the rest of the clones grew too
poorly to obtain sufficient numbers of cells for the assay,
we pooled small hat-resistant colonies and gfp-positive

t-antigen–immortalized fibroblasts with (⫹cre) or without (⫺cre)
adenovirus-cre infection. 2 ⫻ 106 cells were plated, selected in
hat media, and then fixed and stained. cells that reactivated
the xi-linked  xxxg1075xxx  gene were able to proliferate and form colonies. no or very few colonies were observed on control plates and
plates containing conditional mutants before adenovirus-cre infection. however, after cre-mediated deletion of xist in conditional mutants, hat-resistant colonies were routinely detected.
(b) the proportion of hat-resistant cells in the culture does not
change significantly after culturing cells for 7 and 14 d, and 1 and
3 mo after cre-mediated deletion of xist.

as the nature of xist rna–mediated silencing has not
been studied in detail in somatic cells, we next examined
whether xist rna coordinately silences genes on xi or
whether genes are regulated independently of one another. first, we isolated hat-resistant clones with a reactivated  xxxg1075xxx  allele and asked whether these cells are also
gfp-positive (fig. 4). we analyzed two types of clones,
fast-growing ones that grew almost as well as the unselected population (n ⫽ 6), and slow-growing ones that divided barely enough to yield sufficient cells for facs®
analysis (n ⫽ 7). in xist mutant and xist wild-type bulk
populations before hat selection, the number of gfppositive cells was ⵑ1 in 10,000. among fast-growing
clones, the variation was large, but on average the clones
contained 10–20 times more gfp-positive cells than the
unselected populations. in slow-growing clones, the number of gfp-positive cells was on average another 10-fold
higher (fig. 4). yet, even in the clones with the highest
proportion of gfp-positive cells, over 98% of cells remained gfp negative. therefore, most cells that reactivated  xxxg1075xxx  generally did not also reactivate gfp. however, a chromosome that reactivated  xxxg1075xxx  was more prone
to reactivate gfp than a chromosome with an inactive
 xxxg1075xxx  gene.
it is interesting to note that hat-resistant clones with a
higher proportion of gfp-positive cells grew slower than
those with fewer gfp-positive cells. this result is consistent with the conclusion that reactivation of x-inactivated
genes confers selective disadvantage on the cells. in clones
with a higher proportion of gfp-positive cells, the more
extensive reactivation is more detrimental to cell growth.
finally, we isolated gfp-positive clones by sorting
and expanding individual gfp-positive cells, and tested
whether these clones also reactivated  xxxg1075xxx . similarly to
the hat-resistant clones, gfp-positive clones did not
grow well, and most died under hat selection without
yielding a single colony. however, occasionally (2 of the
42 clones analyzed), the clone grew well in hat-containing medium, indicating that most, if not all, cells of the
clone were also  xxxg1075xxx  positive. we conclude that most
clones that reactivated one x-linked gene do not also reactivate another. yet, there is a certain level of cooperativity
in reactivation, as a chromosome that reactivated one gene
on xi, is more likely to reactivate another one than a chromosome that has not reactivated any gene.

synergism of xist rna, dna methylation, and histone
hypoacetylation in x chromosome silencing
next, we examined the relationship between xist rnamediated silencing and inactivation by other mechanisms.
dna methylation and hypoacetylation of core histones
are believed to contribute to inactivation of x-linked genes
(cedar, 1988; keohane et al., 1998). a low frequency of reactivation of x-linked genes has been observed after demethylating cells using  xxxd1823xxx  (mohandas et al., 1981;
graves, 1982). transcriptional activation of silenced genes

inhibitor of histone deacetylases (yoshida et al., 1995). we

xist deletion–induced increase in the number of gfp reactivants disappeared, and we could no longer observe a
difference between xist wild-type and xist-deficient cells
without drug treatment (fig. 2 c). inhibition of histone
deacetylases by itself had no effect on the number of gfppositive cells, whether or not xist was deleted.  xxxd1823xxx –
induced demethylation increased the number of gfp-positive cells by ⵑ20-fold in cells that did not delete xist.
however, the combined effect of xist deletion and
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment was a 30–40-fold increase in gfp reactivants.  xxxd1823xxx  treatment followed by tsa further increased the number of gfp-positive cells by another twofold in both xist mutant and control cells. these results
are summarized in table i. the ⱕ60-fold increase in the
number of cells reactivating gfp indicates that the effects
of xist rna deletion,  xxxd1823xxx , and tsa treatments are
synergistic, rather than simply additive.

clones, and the assay was also performed on the pools.
brdu incorporation into late-replicating regions was detected using an anti-brdu antibody and xi was identified
by dna fish using a probe that detects the gfp transgene. in all clones and pools analyzed, the xi marked by
the gfp transgene was late replicating (fig. 5, b and c).
these results indicate that even after reactivating one or
more genes on xi, the chromosome as a whole remained
inactive. we conclude that reactivation of xi-linked genes
after loss of xist rna occurs at one or a few loci and does
not result in a detectable change in late replication of the
chromosome.

result of the dnmt1 mutants being much more demethylated. transformed cells consistently yielded more gfp,
reactivants possibly because of their increased ability to
proliferate and further demethylate or as a result of decreased stability of silencing in transformed cells. xist/
dnmt1 double mutants reactivated gfp in about twice as
many cells as dnmt1 single mutants, indicating again that
xist and dna methylation cooperate to silence gfp on
xi. gfp was reactivated in ⱖ30% of dnmt1/xist double
mutant cells, representing an almost 3,000-fold increase
over controls (table i). interestingly, the dnmt1 mutation,
or even limited demethylation using  xxxd1823xxx , has a much
more significant effect on the number of gfp reactivants
than the xist mutation, arguing that at least for the
x-linked gfp transgene, dna methylation is a more important contributor to silencing than xist.

deletion on an endogenous x-inactivated gene, we analyzed  xxxg1075xxx  reactivation in adenovirus-cre–infected or

 xxxd1823xxx  treatment leads to limited genomic demethylation (fig. 7 a). more extensive demethylation can be
achieved by deleting dnmt1. to study how x inactivation
is maintained in the absence of xist rna and dna methylation, we bred a dnmt1 conditional allele (jacksongrusby et al., 2001) into the xist mutant colony and generated double conditional mutant fibroblasts. fibroblast
genotypes were xist2lox;gfp/xist⌬,dnmt12lox/s, for xist
conditional mutants, and xist⫹;gfp/xist⌬,dnmt12lox/s, for
control. the dnmt1s allele is a constitutive null mutation
of the gene (lei et al., 1996). upon adenovirus-cre infection of these cells, both xist and dnmt1 were deleted in
xist mutant cells, whereas only dnmt1 was deleted in the
controls (fig. 7 b). deletion of dnmt1 led to a more
pronounced demethylation of bulk genomic dna than
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment (fig. 7). primary dnmt1 mutant fibroblasts arrested within 1 wk of adenovirus-cre infection,
whereas sv-40 t-antigen–transformed cells continued dividing, although at a much slower rate than wild-type cells
(jackson-grusby et al., 2001). we analyzed both primary

rate of  xxxg1075xxx  reactivation in xist-deficient fibroblasts

discussion
we generated fibroblasts in which reactivation of two
genes on the x chromosome, a gfp transgene and the endogenous  xxxg1075xxx  gene, can be detected at a low frequency.
we studied the effect of loss of xist rna, demethylation
of genomic dna and inhibition of histone deacetylation,
on the maintenance of x inactivation. we observed that
deletion of xist leads to reactivation of gfp and  xxxg1075xxx  in a
very small proportion of cells and conclude that xist,
though not essential for the maintenance of x inactivation,
contributes to the stability of the inactive state. we further
showed that xist rna, histone deacetylation, and dna
methylation act synergistically to achieve the extraordinary stability of x chromosome silencing, with reactivation rates comparable to mutation rates.

over uninfected (xist wild type) cells.  xxxd1823xxx  treatment
of xist wild-type cells resulted in a less significant 10-fold
increase in the number colonies per plate. however,
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment of xist mutant cells resulted in a 50fold increase in hat-resistant cells over untreated xist mutant cells and an almost 5,000-fold increase over untreated
xist wild-type cells (table i). the combined effect of xist
deletion and demethylation is more significant than either
treatment alone, implying a synergistic interaction of xist
rna and dna methylation in keeping  xxxg1075xxx  silent. it is
interesting to note that although the absolute numbers of
gfp- and  xxxg1075xxx -positive cells are different,  xxxd1823xxx  treatment led to comparable enrichment in reactivants for both
genes (19- and 12-fold, respectively). however, xist rna
seems to play a more major role in  xxxg1075xxx  silencing than in
gfp silencing (100-fold enrichment compared with twoto threefold enrichment). the gfp transgene may not be

it has been shown that during the early stages of cellular
differentiation, an xist rna–mediated silencing mechanism initiates x inactivation (penny et al., 1996; marahrens et al., 1997; wutz and jaenisch, 2000), and that xist
becomes dispensable for the maintenance of x inactivation after subsequent differentiation (brown and willard,
1994; rack et al., 1994, csankovszki et al., 1999). however, we now present direct evidence that an xist rna–
mediated maintenance mechanism contributes to silencing
in somatic cells. deletion of xist reduces the histone
macroh2a1 content of xi chromatin (csankovszki et al.,
1999), and it is possible that this change in histone compo-

isolated and digested with the methylation-sensitive restriction
enzyme hpaii. the blotted dna was hybridized with an iap
probe to analyze demethylation of bulk genomic dna. demethylation due to  xxxd1823xxx  treatment is indicated by the appearance
of low molecular weight bands. (b) adenovirus-cre–mediated

t-antigen–immortalized cells is shown on southern blots of speidigested dna hybridized with the hv probe (lower blot).
nearly 100% recombination is seen in both controls and mutants.
the same genomic dna samples were also digested with hpaii
and hybridized with the iap probe (upper blot). the appearance
of more low molecular weight bands and the disappearance of
high molecular weight bands indicate that the genomic dna in
these samples is more extensively demethylated than in  xxxd1823xxx –
treated cultures.

to test whether the observed hat-resistant colonies are
the result of independent  xxxg1075xxx  reactivation events or proliferation of a few reactivants, we calculated  xxxg1075xxx  reactivation rates using the luria-delbrück fluctuation analysis
(luria and delbrück, 1943). a large number of cultures of
adenovirus-cre–infected and –uninfected cells were expanded from a few cells (generally ⬍100). during expansion, half of the cultures were treated with  xxxd1823xxx . after
the desired culture size was reached, cells were selected
using hat, and the number of cultures that yielded hatresistant colonies and the reactivation rates were determined (table ii). the positive cultures ranged from those
containing one clone to those containing confluent plates,
indicating that the reactivation event took place at different times during cultivation. the spontaneous reactivation
rate of  xxxg1075xxx  was as low as previously reported mutation
rates in wild-type cells (10⫺9) (chen et al., 1998), demonstrating the remarkable stability of x chromosome silencing. the reactivation rate increased by ⵑ160-fold after deletion of xist and 60-fold after  xxxd1823xxx  treatment,
indicating that both xist rna and dna methylation contribute significantly to silencing. however, combining xist
deletion with  xxxd1823xxx  treatment resulted in an almost
10,000-fold increase, confirming synergism of dna methylation and xist expression in the maintenance of the inactive state.

 xxxg1075xxx  reactivation rates were determined using the p0 method of luria and delbrück (1943). a number of independent cultures of xist conditional mutant fibroblasts infected with
adenovirus-cre (⌬) or left uninfected (⫹) were expanded to the appropriate size. when appropriate, cultures were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  to inhibit dna methylation. after hat
selection, the number of cultures with hat-resistant clones was determined, and  xxxg1075xxx  reactivation rates were calculated.

the two genes analyzed, gfp and  xxxg1075xxx , are both subject
to x inactivation, but the reactivation rates are different.
in the presence of xist rna and wild-type levels of methylation and  xxxg1052xxx  acetylation,  xxxg1075xxx  is almost never
reactivated, whereas gfp reactivation can be readily observed. the difference can be at least partially attributed
to the difference in assays. although reactivation of gfp
can be observed almost instantly on facs®, detection of
 xxxg1075xxx  reactivants by hat selection requires that the cells
survive reactivation and maintain their proliferative capacity. the smallest detectable hat-resistant colony contained ⵑ30 cells, the result of about five cell divisions.
the transgenic nature of gfp might also influence the
way the gene responds to silencing mechanisms. xist rna
may not be able to exert the same level of control over a
transgene as over endogenous genes, therefore deletion of
xist has a smaller effect on gfp reactivation than on  xxxg1075xxx 
reactivation. on the other hand, dna methylation contributes significantly to the silencing of both genes. randomly integrated transgenes are frequently methylated
(hertz et al., 1999), which may contribute to their variable
expression. gfp is integrated near the centromere and
therefore might also be subject to silencing by centric heterochromatin. nonspecific silencing of gfp by mechanisms unrelated to x inactivation (eggan et al., 2000) may
explain the rapid disappearance of gfp reactivants from
the cultures. the observed influence of different mechanisms on  xxxg1075xxx  may more faithfully represent silencing of
endogenous x-inactivated genes.

csankovszki et al. maintenance of x inactivation

the synergism of multiple silencing mechanisms to assure a highly stable repressed state possibly reflects the
importance of dosage compensation for the proper functioning of the organism. it has been demonstrated that
gene dosage imbalance in the embryo (takagi and abe,
1990), or in the extraembryonic tissues (marahrens et al.,
1997), causes lethality. however, partial reactivation of
the chromosome appears to be tolerated in vitro, and it
is possible to isolate and culture cells with reactivated
x-linked genes. yet, our fibroblast clones with reactivated
xi-linked genes grew more poorly than fibroblasts of the
same genotype that did not reactivate any gene. these results argue that gene dosage imbalance is detrimental to
cell growth even in vitro and that clones that reactivated
the entire chromosome may not be viable. therefore, our
calculations of reactivation frequencies might be an underestimation, as cells with reactivated chromosomes may die
before they can be detected.

xist rna and dna methylation contribute differently
to silencing of two x-linked genes

sition leads to compromised efficiency of silencing. however, to directly assess the role of histone macroh2a1 in x
chromosome inactivation, analysis of a targeted mutation
of the gene will be necessary.
dna methylation is another significant contributor to
silencing. demethylation by  xxxd1823xxx  has been used before
to reactivate genes on xi (mohandas et al., 1981; graves,
1982). in this study, we also introduced a dnmt1 mutation
that proved to be ⵑ100 times as effective as  xxxd1823xxx  treatment in achieving reactivation of gfp. demethylation
combined with xist deletion increased reactivation rates
to a greater extent than either did alone, indicating synergism of silencing mechanisms in keeping xi silent. in the
case of the gfp transgene, we accomplished ⱖ30% reactivation in xist/dnmt1 double mutant fibroblasts. however,
at least in the case of  xxxg1075xxx , the majority of the cells maintained silencing even after deletion of xist and demethylation, indicating the presence of additional stabilizing
mechanisms, such as late replication.
partial compensation for reduced methylation on xi by
other silencing mechanisms occurs in icf patients. xi in
these patients lacks methylation on cpg islands (hansen
et al., 2000) and, therefore, presumably histone deacetylation is also compromised. however, xist rna localizes
normally to xi and, together with late replication, is able
to maintain x inactivation, although with reduced efficiency (hansen et al., 2000).
inhibition of histone deacetylation by tsa led to a
small increase in the number of gfp reactivants. one possible explanation for the modest effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors is the slow rate of histone acetate turnover
on the xi of differentiated cells leading to limited enrichment in acetylated histones after tsa treatment (keohane et al., 1998). indeed, treatment of cells with another
 xxxd565xxx ,  xxxd3211xxx , did not increase antiacetylated histone staining on xi (jeppesen and
turner, 1993). furthermore, tsa only inhibits gfp silencing in demethylated cells. a similar dependence of reactivation of genes by tsa on demethylation has been
observed by others studying genes silenced in cancer
(cameron et al., 1999), implying that in these cases dna
methylation is the primary mechanism that recruits histone deacetylases to the silenced loci, possibly via binding
of methyl-dna binding proteins (jones et al., 1998; nan
et al., 1998). in other cases, histone deacetylase inhibitors
alone were sufficient to achieve reactivation, such as reexpression of the fmr1 gene in cells derived from fragile x
syndrome patients, whereas synergism of histone deacetylation and dna methylation was still observed (chiurazzi
et al., 1999).

mechanism of x chromosome silencing

the journal of cell biology, volume 153, 2001

in recent years, significant progress has been made in deciphering how dna and histone modifications regulate
transcription. methylation of dna is thought to change
accessibility of chromatin via binding of methylated dna
binding proteins that in turn can recruit histone deacetylases (jones et al., 1998; nan et al., 1998). acetylated nh2terminal lysines of histones, aside from affecting compactness of chromatin packaging, can bind the bromodomain
module present in a wide range of chromatin remodeling
proteins (dhalluin et al., 1999; jacobson et al., 2000).
the mechanism of xist rna–mediated silencing is not
as well understood. xist rna is involved in preferential
localization of histone macroh2a1 to xi (csankovszki et
al., 1999). however, we do not know whether histone
macroh2a1 and xist rna interact directly and to what
extent histone macroh2a1 participates in silencing. it has
been shown that xist rna can silence in the absence of
dna methylation (panning and jaenisch, 1996), or even
before cellular differentiation (wutz and jaenisch, 2000).
xist rna can also accomplish transcriptional silencing
without the chromosome becoming late replicating or hypoacetylated (wutz and jaenisch, 2000). this study provides evidence that the xist rna–mediated silencing
mechanism acts synergistically with other silencing factors.
xist rna, similarly to dna methylation, appears to act
in a localized manner, not as a master switch regulating the
entire chromosome. our observations on the effects of deletion of xist and earlier studies on  xxxd1823xxx  reactivated
clones (mohandas et al., 1981; graves, 1982) indicate that
reactivation of genes on xi is neither coordinate nor independent, as reactivation of one gene correlates with reactivation of other linked genes only to a limited extent. xist
mutant clones with reactivated genes, in which the lack
of xist rna–mediated silencing has phenotypic consequences, provide a useful reagent for further dissecting out
how xist rna might accomplish silencing.
