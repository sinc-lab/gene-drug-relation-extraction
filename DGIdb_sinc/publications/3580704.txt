1 the affinity of a number of 'selective' agonists and antagonists has been assessed at atrial or ileal
receptors by use of in vitro functional analysis.
2 the most selective compound for ileal muscarinic receptors was silabenzhexol (approx. 50 fold),
and to a lesser extent benzhexol (approx. 5 fold). conversely, the most selective compound for the atrial
muscarinic receptors was af-dx 116 (approx. 6 fold).
3 the novel m,-receptor antagonist, telenzepine and other antagonists such as propantheline and
 xxxd2399xxx  did not distinguish between atrial and ileal receptors.
4 dicyclomine, adiphenine, hexahydroadiphenine and  xxxd2817xxx  exhibited competitive
antagonism at atrial receptors but non-competitive antagonism at ileal receptors. no conclusions
could, therefore, be drawn with regard to their selectivity.
5 the agonists, arecaidine propargyl ester (ape), ethoxyethyltriethylammonium (eoe) and
carbachol, exhibited some selectivity in potency but little difference in affinity.
6 it is concluded that the study supports the existence of ileal and atrial muscarinic receptor subtypes.
however, the use of dicyclomine and related compounds in receptor classification is limited.
muscarinic

introduction

muscarinic receptors are currently classified according to their affinity towards  xxxd2965xxx . m,-receptors
exhibit a high affinity, whilst m2-receptors exhibit a
low affinity (hammer & giachetti, 1982). atrial and
ileal receptors are currently classified as m2 (barlow et
al., 1981; clague et al., 1985).
a number of groups have proposed that ileal and
atrial receptors may be distinguished pharmacologically (barlow et al., 1976; barlow et al., 1980;
barlow & shepherd, 1985; fuderetal., 1985; clague et
al., 1985; giachetti etal., 1986). antagonists such as 4diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine methiodide (4damp, barlow et al., 1976), its pentamethylene
derivative (barlow & shepherd, 1985), and silicon
derivatives of  xxxd1907xxx  and  xxxd3019xxx  (lambrecht et al., 1984; mutschler & lambrecht, 1984; fuder
et al., 1985; lambrecht et al., 1986) exhibit varying
degrees of selectivity towards ileal muscarinic receptors. the most selective of these, hexahydrosiladiphenidol (fuder et al., 1985) exhibited 27 fold selectivity towards the ileal muscarinic receptor, an order
'author for correspondence.

of selectivity comparable with that of  xxxd2965xxx  for
the putative m,-receptor in ganglia in comparison to
the putative m2-receptor in the ileum (brown et al.,
1980). differences between ileal and atrial muscarinic
receptors have also been apparent in a limited number
of ligand binding studies (choo & mitchelson, 1985).
antagonists exhibiting the converse atrial selectivity
have, until recently, been limited to the neuromuscular
relaxants such as  xxxd2174xxx  or pancuronium (see
mitchelson, 1984, for review). the aforementioned
compounds are limited in their use in receptor classification, because of their allosteric interactions,
resulting in non-linear schild plots with slopes of less
than unity (mitchelson, 1984; clague et al., 1985).
however, the novel antagonist, af-dx 116 (11-(2[(diethylamino) methyl]-l-piperidinyl acetyl)-5, -1 -

dihydro-6h- xxxd3047xxx  (2.3-b) (1.4)-benzodiazepin-6one) has been shown, on the basis of ligand binding
studies, to exhibit selectivity for m2-, low  xxxd2965xxx 
affinity sites present in the myocardium (hammer et
al., 1986) and has been proposed as an m2- selective
antagonist (hammer et al., 1986). in addition, the
compound has been reported to exhibit a degree of

selectivity at atrial muscarinic receptors, in comparison to those in smooth muscle (giachetti et al., 1986).
it has also been reported (anwar-ul et al., 1986) that
the plant alkaloid, himbacine, exhibits approx. 10 fold
selectivity for atrial muscarinic receptors, in comparison to those on the ileum.
there have been proposed (mutschler & hultzsch,
1973; mutschler & lambrecht, 1984; barlow & weston-smith, 1985) agonists which exhibit atrial selectivity, i.e. arecaidine propargyl ester (ape), and ileal
selectivity, i.e. ethoxyethyltriethylammonium (eoe).
however, no data are available on the affinity of these
agonists for these receptors.
the aim of the present study was therefore to
determine the affinity of a series of muscarinic
antagonists and agonists, in order to compare their
selectivity. in addition, the selectivity of antagonists
recently proposed to exhibit selectivity for the putative
m,-receptor have also been studied. these include,
telenzepine, a derivative of  xxxd2965xxx , which has
been reported to possess a similar in vivo selectivity
profile (eltze et al., 1985) and dicyclomine. dicyclomine has been reported to bind selectively to
cerebral cortical membranes, in comparison to those
in the myocardium (kenny et al., 1985: freedman et
al., 1986). it has also been reported that dicyclomine
exhibits a higher affinity towards the parotid gland
binding sites than to those present in the ileum or
urinary bladder (nilvebrandt & sparf, 1983).
schiavone et al. (1985) found that dicyclomine selectively inhibits gastric secretion. marchi & raiteri
(1985) reported that dicyclomine antagonized muscarinic receptors that inhibit dopamine release, rather
than receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release. these
functional properties have been ascribed to its m,receptor antagonism. the affinity of telenzepine and
dicyclomine (and related compounds such as adiphenine and hexahydroadiphenine) has therefore been
assessed in this study at atrial and smooth muscle
muscarinic receptors.
preliminary accounts of this work have recently
been communicated to the british pharmacological
society ( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1985;  xxxd1704xxx  & whiting, 1986).
methods
the methods used have been described by clague et al.
(1985). all experiments were conducted at ph 7.4,
30Â°c, on tissue from dunkin-hartley guinea-pigs
(female, 250-300 g body wt). carbachol, except where
indicated, was used as the agonist.
hexamethonium was absent from the buffer solution, since previous studies (barlow et al., 1976;
clague et al., 1985) have indicated that nicotinic
interactions were without effect on the - log kd
estimations at the agonist concentrations employed.

ileum

portions of proximal ileum (1.5 cm) were isolated,
washed and resuspended under 1.0 g tension in
modified tyrode buffer. after 1 h equilibration, agonists were added for 30 s in a 5 min dose cycle. the
responsiveness of each tissue was assessed by repeating
the carbachol concentration-response curve until
reproducible responses were obtained.
atria

paired atria were suspended under 1.0 g tension in
modified krebs-bicarbonate buffer. after 1 h
equilibration, non-cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed to the agonist. agonists
were added for 3 min, a 5 min dose-cycle was used, and
tissue responses were measured over the last 15 s of
each agonist exposure period.
trachea

helical spirals of trachea were suspended under 1.0 g
tension, in similar modified krebs bicarbonate buffer
to that used for the atria. the tissues were allowed 1 h
to equilibrate, and cumulative concentration-response
curves to each agonist were constructed. incremental
concentrations of each agonist were added either when
the previous response had attained a plateau, or after
5 min had elapsed. concentration-response curves
were repeated until reproducible responses were
attained.
bladder

the urinary bladder was isolated distally, and cut
tangentally to form an open sheet. this was suspended
under 1.0 g tension, and experiments performed as
described for the trachea, above.
measurement of responses

changes in isometric tension were measured in the
ileum, trachea and bladder. in the latter preparation,
muscarinic agonists induced increases in both the rate
of spontaneous phasic contraction and changes in
baseline tension. only these latter responses were used.
atrial responses were determined as changes in the
rate of spontaneous beating.
antagonist affinity (-log kd)

concentration-response curves were repeated in the
presence of at least three concentrations of antagonist,
allowing 45 min equilibration at each concentration.
the dose-ratios were calculated, and the - log kd value
and schild slope were derived by the method of

selective antagonism at muscarinic receptors

arunlakshana & schild (1959). the dose-ratios for
each tissue were pooled for each concentration of
antagonist and a line ofbest fit drawn through the data
using linear regression by the method of least squares.
the intercept with the abscissae and slope of the
resulting line were then calculated.
agonist potency (- log ec50)

the potency ofthe agonists used was derived by a nonlinear iterative curve-fitting procedure (michel &
whiting, 1985).
agonist affinity (-log ka)

the method used was that of furchgott & bursztyn
(1967). concentration-response curves to the agonist
were constructed prior to and after inactivation of a
portion of the receptor population, by incubation of
the tissues with phenoxybenzamine (3 ftm) for 20 min.
after this period, the tissues were washed twice, and
the concentration-response curve repeated. these
procedures resulted in a dextral shift in the concentration-response curve and a depression in the maximum
response of between 20 and 80%. preliminary
experiments had shown that phenoxybenzamine, with
this regime, inactivated only the muscarinic receptors,
since incubation of the tissues with atropine (0.1 m)
completely protected against inactivation.
several equiactive concentrations of each agonist
before, [a] and after, [a'] inactivation were determined; l/[a] was then plotted against 1/[a'] and a
straight line fitted through the data by linear regression analysis; from the slope and the intercept on the
ordinate scale, the dissociation constant (ka) of the
agonist-receptor complex was calculated.
agonist relative efficacy (e,)

this was determined according to the method of
ringdahl & jenden (1983), using the relationship:

a2
e

=

wr-

e,

 xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx + a2

e2

a

kai

+

al

where er = relative efficacy; e, = efficacy of carbachol;
e2= efficacy of test agonist; al and a2 are concentrations of carbachol and the test agonist which elicits
50% response (i.e. ec50); ka, and  xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx  are dissociation
constants of carbachol and the test agonist.

ileum: nacl 136.9, kci 2.7, mgcl2 6h20 1.1,
nah2po4-2h2o 0.4, glucose 5.6, nahco3 11.8 and
cacl2 6h2o 1.8; for the atria, trachea and bladder:
nacl 118.4, kci 4.7,  xxxd2534xxx -7h2o 1.2, kh2po4 1.2,
glucose 10.0, nahco3 25.0 and cac12- 6h20 2.5.
all solutions were gassed with 5% c02/95% 02
drugs used

the following were obtained from sigma: adiphenine,
carbachol,  xxxd2399xxx ,  xxxd2817xxx , benzhexol
(trihexyphenidyl). af-dx 116, ape and silabenzhexol were synthesized by dr r. clark, syntex, palo
alto. the following were generously donated: dicyclomine (dow-merrill), eoe (dr r.b. barlow,
university of bristol), hexahydroadiphenine (cibageigy), phenoxybenzamine (s.k and f) and telenzepine (byk-guilden).

results
antagonists

the -log kd values and corresponding schild slopes
are shown in table 1. all antagonists acted competitively at atrial muscarinic receptors, since the
schild slopes were not significantly different
(p > 0.05) from unity. telenzepine, benzhexol,
silabenzhexol, propantheline,  xxxd2399xxx  and afdx 16 exhibited similar behaviour at ileal muscarinic
receptors. in contrast, dicyclomine, adiphenine, hexahydroadiphenine and  xxxd2817xxx  acted non-competitively at ileal muscarinic receptors, since the schild
slopes were significantly (p < 0.05) less than unity. in
all experiments, however, the schild plots were linear
through the concentration range tested for each
antagonist.
there were no significant differences (p>0.05)
observed between ileal and atrial - log kd values
obtained with telenzepine, dicyclomine, adiphenine,
hexahydroadiphenine,  xxxd2817xxx , propantheline
and  xxxd2399xxx . in contrast, benzhexol and silabenzhexol exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) greater - log
kd values at ileal muscarinic receptors, in comparison
to the atria. the converse was true for af-dx 116.
dicyclomine, adiphenine, hexahydroadiphenine
and  xxxd2817xxx  were further studied at muscarinic

discussion

this study has inv estigated the differences in affinity
of either antagonistts (- log kd) or agonists (- log ka)
at ileal or atrial ml ascarinic receptors. as in a similar
study by our grou; p (clague et al., 1985), the criteria
proposed by furc] hgott (1972) and kenakin (1984)
have been used in the interpretation of the data.
the differences in - log kd values exhibited by

silabenzhexol and t o a lesser extent by benzhexol lend
support to the hype )thesis of ileal and atrial muscarinic
subtypes. the diffeerence, particularly with silabenzhexol, was greater than the minimum 0.5 - log kd
units described by furchgott (1972) as evidence for
receptor heterogen eity. in addition, the schild slopes
were linear and nott significantly different from unity,
indicating that the -log kdvalue was a good estimate
of the affinity cons;tant (kenakin, 1984).
however, it she uld be noted that whilst in this
study, the replace-ment of the carbon by silicon
increased the ileal affinity of benzhexol, the order of

705

selectivity is not the same as was observed by mutschler & lambrecht (1984). the most selective compound identified by this group was hexahydrosiladiphenidol. the reason for this disparity in orders of
selectivity between their results and ours is unknown.
however, since -log kd values for silabenzhexol at
muscarinic receptors present on the trachea, bladder
or taenia caeci have been found to be about 8.5 ( xxxd1704xxx ,
unpublished observation) it is possible that the value
obtained at ileal muscarinic receptors in the present
study, may be an overestimation.
af-dx 116 exhibited selectivity for the atrial muscarinic receptors. this compound, in contrast to
compounds such as  xxxd2174xxx  (see mitchelson, 1984),
also acted competitively. these data confirm the
myocardial selectivity previously reported by hammer et al. (1986) and giachetti et al. (1986). however,
the absolute values obtained in the present study differ
from those previously reported (giachetti et al., 1986:
ileum - log kd = 6.4, atria (force) = 7.3). it is interesting to note that the compound has been reported to
exhibit a high degree of selectivity between muscarinic
binding sites in the myocardium and lacryimal gland
(hammer et al., 1986), which may further indicate
heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors.
these two antagonists, af-dx 116 and derivatives
of benzhexol, appear to be useful agents, in addition to
4-damp (barlow & shepherd, 1985) and hexahydrosilaldiphenidol (fuder et al., 1985) in the classification of muscarinic receptors. however, this may
not be true for the agonists examined. carbachol, in
agreement with previous data (clague et al., 1985) was
not selective in terms of potency and only marginally
so in terms of affinity. this was also observed for ape
and in this respect the data differ from those of other
workers (mutschler & hulztch, 1973; mutschler &
lambrecht, 1984; barlow & shepherd, 1985) who
found approximately a 5 fold selectivity for atrial
receptors. eoe in terms of potency was found to be 10
fold selective for ileal receptors, in agreement with
barlow & weston-smith (1985). however, its selectivity in terms of affinity was less evident and was
similar to carbachol. this may indicate other reasons
for its selective potency, such as effective receptor
reserve.
the putative m,-antagonists, telenzepine and dicyclomine (eltze et al., 1985; schiavone et al., 1985) did
not distinguish between ileal and atrial receptors.
telenzepine exhibited a higher - log kd for both
receptors than was observed with  xxxd2965xxx  (6-8,
clague et al., 1985) and the atrial value is in good
agreement with that of eltze et al. (1985). no conclusion can be arrived at with regard to its m,selectivity from the present study.
dicyclomine, adiphenine, hexahydroadiphenine
and  xxxd2817xxx  exhibit higher affinities for muscarinic binding sites in the rat cerebral cortex, in

706

r.m.  xxxd1704xxx  & r.l. whiting

comparison to those in the myocardium (michel,
unpublished observations). all four compounds,
however, appeared to possess properties other than
muscarinic antagonism since the antagonism was noncompetitive at smooth muscle muscarinic receptors.
the non-competitive nature of antagonism by dicyclomine observed in this study is in good agreement
with observations of other workers (brown et al.,
1950; mcgrath et al., 1964; downie et al., 1977). the
compound has been shown (see above references) to
possess non-specific muscle relaxant properties and
antagonize the contractile responses to histamine and
potassium, in addition to muscarinic agonists. these
properties appear to limit their use in muscarinic
receptor classification using functional assays. the
selectivity reported by schiavone et al. (1985) against
gastric acid secretion in comparison to motility may be
due to its histamine antagonism (downie et al., 1977).
in addition, the disparity between the - log kd values
obtained by marchi & raiteri (1985) at presynaptic
muscarinic receptors inhibiting dopamine and acetylcholine release using dicyclomine may also be due to
its non-specific actions. one may conclude, therefore,
that dicyclomine is not suitable as an m,-antagonist
for functional reasons, in addition to its dissimilar

binding characteristics when compared to  xxxd2965xxx 
(kenny et al., 1985; freedman et al., 1986), i.e. the hill
slope is unity for rat cortical binding sites.
in conclusion, the data support the concept of ileal
and atrial muscarinic receptor subtypes. the use of
dicyclomine and related compounds appears to be
limited in muscarinic classification, since they exhibit
properties unrelated to muscarinic antagonism. the
order of selectivity of some ileal and atrial antagonists
is now approaching that of  xxxd2965xxx , upon which
the m,/m2 classification is based (hammer & giachetti, 1982). taken together, there are at least two
compounds that are selective for muscarinic receptors
in the smooth muscle (4-damp and hexahydrosiladiphenidol; barlow & shepherd, 1985; fuder et al.,
1985) and conversely, two compounds that are selective for the atrial receptors (af-dx 116 and himbacine; giachetti et al., 1986 and anwar-ul et al.,
1986). however, it should be noted that there is still a
lack of selective agonists and the selectivities observed
with the antagonists are still small.
the authors wish to thank miss c. small for her technical
assistance.
