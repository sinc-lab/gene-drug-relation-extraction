rosiglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent that has recently been shown to exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. in addition to peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor (ppar)-␥, rosiglitazone can affect other targets,
such as directly inhibiting recombinant long-chain acylcoa synthetase (acsl)-4 activity. because it is unknown if
 xxxg49xxx  is expressed in vascular cells involved in atherosclerosis, we investigated the ability of rosiglitazone to
inhibit acsl activity and fatty acid partitioning in human
and murine arterial smooth muscle cells (smcs) and macrophages. human and murine smcs and human macrophages expressed  xxxg49xxx , and rosiglitazone inhibited acsl
activity in these cells. furthermore, rosiglitazone acutely
inhibited partitioning of  xxxd2154xxx  into phospholipids in
human smcs and inhibited fatty acid partitioning into
diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in human smcs and macrophages through a ppar-␥–independent mechanism. conversely, murine macrophages did not express  xxxg49xxx , and
rosiglitazone did not inhibit acsl activity in these cells,
nor did it affect acute fatty acid partitioning into cellular
lipids. thus, rosiglitazone inhibits acsl activity and fatty
acid partitioning in human and murine smcs and in human
macrophages through a ppar-␥–independent mechanism
likely to be mediated by  xxxg49xxx  inhibition. therefore,
rosiglitazone might alter the biological effects of fatty
acids in these cells and in atherosclerosis. diabetes 56:

ong-chain
acyl-coa
synthetases
(acsls)
(e.c.6.2.1.3) catalyze esterification of long-chain
 xxxd2154xxx , mediating the partitioning of fatty
acids in mammalian cells. acsl isoforms
( xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , acsl5, and acsl6) generate
bioactive fatty acyl-coas from coa, atp, and long-chain
(c12–c20)  xxxd2154xxx  (1). acsls exhibit different tissue
distribution, subcellular localization, fatty acid preference,
responsiveness to pharmacological inhibitors, and transcriptional regulation. previous studies have characterized
these enzymes in different tissues (2); however, expression
levels and function in vascular cells are unknown. until
recently, inconsistencies in the acsl nomenclature led to
confusion in the literature. the standard nomenclature
now uses  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg48xxx – 6 for human and  xxxg47xxx  and
 xxxg48xxx – 6 for murine members of this family (3).
thiazolidinediones (tzds) are a class of oral insulinsensitizing agents, extensively used in the treatment of
type 2 diabetes. whereas members of this class of agents,
such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been demonstrated to provide effective glycemic control in patients
with diabetes (4), their effect on lipid metabolism is less
clear (5). perhaps more interesting are the recent findings
that rosiglitazone treatment results in fewer inflammatory
cells and increased collagen content in advanced atherosclerotic plaques (6,7; rev. in 8), suggesting that rosiglitazone might exert a stabilizing effect on atherosclerotic
plaques.
the mechanism of tzd action is mediated largely
through the activation of ppar-␥, a member of the super
family of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors. in
vascular tissue, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (ppar)-␥ is expressed in smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. tzds may also exert
nongenomic effects. for example, rosiglitazone has been
shown to activate 5⬘-amp protein kinase (ampk) through
a ppar-␥–independent mechanism (9). with regard to
acsl isoforms, in vitro studies of rat recombinant proteins
have demonstrated that tzds can directly inhibit the
activity of one of the gene products,  xxxg49xxx  (10).
because of the strong association among increased fatty
acid load, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease,

rosiglitazone inhibits  xxxg49xxx  activity

particularly in the setting of type 2 diabetes, we investigated the ability of rosiglitazone to inhibit acsl activity
and acute fatty acid partitioning in smooth muscle cells
(smcs) and macrophages. we show that human and
murine smcs and human macrophages express a number
of acsl isoforms and that  xxxg49xxx , the rosiglitazonesensitive isoform, is expressed in these cells. we also
show that rosiglitazone inhibits acsl activity and fatty
acid partitioning in human and murine smcs and in human
macrophages through a ppar-␥–independent mechanism
likely to be mediated by direct inhibition of  xxxg49xxx .
furthermore, rosiglitazone might exert effects on fatty
acid partitioning in human macrophages that are not
mimicked by mouse models, because murine macrophages are devoid of  xxxg49xxx .
research design and methods
 xxxd2777xxx  (oa) (sodium salt) was purchased from nucheck prep (elysian,
mn). rpmi-1640, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from gibco/invitrogen (grand island, ny). coa, atp, essentially fatty
acid–free bsa, sodium thioglycollate, dithiothreitol, edta, egta, leupeptin,
aprotinin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and  xxxd302xxx  were
obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). triascin c, t0070907, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxaide 1-␤-d-ribo-furanoside (aicar), 15-deoxy-⌬12,14 prostaglandin j2 (15-dpgj2), and wy14643 were from biomol research laboratories
(plymouth meeting, pa). rosiglitazone was obtained from alexis biochemical
(san diego, ca). anti-rabbit igg horseradish peroxidase–linked antibodies,
[9,10(n)-3h]-oa (259 gbq/mmol), [1-14c]-oa (2.07 gbq/mmol), and [u-14c]glycerol (5.9 gbq/mmol) were obtained from amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj).  xxxd208xxx  (aa) [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,3h(n)] (6.66 – 8.88 tbq/
mmol, 9.25 mbq) was obtained from perkin elmer life and analytical
sciences (wellesley, ma). recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-bb was from upstate biotechnology (lake placid, ny).
isolation and culture of human smcs. normal human aortic smooth
muscle cells (hsmcs) were isolated by an explant method and grown as
previously described (11). incubation with  xxxd2154xxx  was performed in
serum-free medium in the presence of 0.5% fatty acid–free bsa. all investigation on human cells was conducted according to the principles of the
declaration of helsinki.
isolation of human monocyte– derived macrophages. monocytes were
purified from buffy coats obtained from human donors by the red cross
(portland, or), as described (12). monocytes were purified by using densitygradient centrifugation with  xxxd3253xxx -paque plus (amersham pharmacia biotech), followed by positive selection with magnetic cd-14 microbeads
(miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca). monocytes were differentiated in rpmi medium 1640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine
serum and buffered with 10 mmol/l hepes. the monocytes were differentiated to macrophages at a concentration of 5 ⫻ 105 cells per milliliter with 100
ng/ml granulocyte  xxxd1696xxx  (leukine; drug
services, university of washington).
isolation and culture of murine smcs. normal murine smcs were isolated
from the thoracic aorta of male c57bl/6 mice via enzymatic digestion (13).
isolation of murine peritoneal macrophages. peritoneal macrophages
were collected from male and female c57bl/6 (25–30 g) mice 5 days after
intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml thioglycollate (40 mg/ml), as described
previously (14). the harvested cells were incubated in an erythrocyte lysis
buffer (155 mmol/l nh4cl, 10 mmol/l khco3, 0.1 mmol/l edta) for removal of
residual erythrocytes before plating. all animal work was approved and
performed by following the guidelines for the use and care of laboratory
animals at the university of washington.
reverse transcriptase and pcr. total rna was isolated from quiesced
hsmcs (passage 4 –11), murine smcs (passage 2–5), human monocyte–
derived macrophages, or murine peritoneal macrophages, using an rneasy
mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). a total amount of 250 ng rna was reversetranscribed using random hexamers and omniscript reverse transcriptase (0.2
units/␮l; invitrogen, grand island, ny). the mixture was incubated for 60 min
at 37°c and heat-inactivated for 5 min at 94°c. the resultant cdna template
was amplified by pcr with specific oligonucleotide primers targeted for
human and murine  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , acsl5, and acsl6 (table 1).
primers were designed to recognize all known splice variants, including the
newly described splice variants for human  xxxg47xxx  and acsl6 (15). pcr was
performed using a geneamp pcr system (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca) with a primer concentration of 400 nmol/l. pcr products were then
1144

separated via gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and visualized with
ethidium bromide. murine brain and liver were used as positive controls for
the  xxxg48xxx , acsl5, and acsl6 primers. a human neuroblastoma cell line
(sh-sy5y) was used as a positive control for human acsl6.
western blot analysis of  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx . lysates were prepared as
previously described (12,14,16), separated using 7.5% tris-glycine sds-page,
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. the membranes
were then incubated overnight at 4°c with rabbit polyclonal anti-rat  xxxg47xxx  or
 xxxg49xxx  antibodies (1:10,000) generated against the amino acid sequences
mevhelfryfrmpelidir and eihsmqsveelgskpenssi, respectively
(17). horseradish peroxidase–linked anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were
used at a final dilution of 1:5,000 for 1 h at room temperature. signal detection
was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence. recombinant rat  xxxg49xxx  (3
␮g) was used as a positive control. rat liver high-speed supernatant was used
as a positive control for  xxxg47xxx  expression. briefly, rat liver was homogenized
(1:3; weight:volume) using a potter-elvehjem homogenizer in a 320 mmol/l
sucrose buffer containing tris-hcl, ph 7.4 (20 mmol/l), edta (1 mmol/l),
egta (1 mmol/l), leupeptin (20 ␮g/ml),  xxxd302xxx  (1 mmol/l), aprotinin (10
␮g/ml), pepstatin (5 ␮g/ml), dithiothreitol (1 mmol/l), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mmol/l). the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd2274xxx ,700g for 2 min.
the supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000g for 12 min and then at
177,000g for 1 h. the resulting high-speed supernatant was used for analyses.
analysis of acsl activity. total acyl-coa synthetase activity was measured
via a modified protocol by kim et al. (10), involving the formation of oa-coa
from oa. briefly, cells were scraped into ice-cold cell sonication buffer
containing 50 mmol/l potassium phosphate (ph 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/l
edta, 20 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 5 ␮g/ml pepstatin, 10 ␮g/ml aprotinin, and 5 mmol/l
 xxxd302xxx  and sonicated with two bursts of 10-s duration at 50 w. protein
concentration was determined via bca protein assays (pierce, rockford, il).
the lysate (200 ␮g/sample) was then incubated in the presence of increasing
concentrations of rosiglitazone, triacsin c, 15-dpgj2, aicar, or wy16463 for
20 min at 37°c in a reaction mixture containing 175 mmol/l tris (ph 7.4), 8
mmol/l mgcl2, 5 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 10 mmol/l atp, and 250 ␮mol/l coa
with 50 ␮mol/l oa trace-labeled with [3h]-oa (1 ␮ci) in a final volume of 200
␮l. the reaction was initiated by the addition of total cell lysate and
terminated by the addition of 1 ml doles reagent ( xxxd2400xxx :hexane:h2so4;
80:20:2), followed by 2 ml heptane, 0.5 ml water, and vigorous vortexing. the
upper layer was removed and the lower (aqueous) phase was washed with 2
ml heptane. the radioactivity of the lower phase was evaluated by a liquid
scintillation counter. the radioactivity measured was used to calculate the
total enzymatic activity and was expressed as picomoles of oa-coa ester
formed per unit time. the results were corrected for blanks (samples without
cell lysates added and samples analyzed in the absence of coa or atp) and for
protein content. all reactions were confirmed to occur in the linear range.
fatty acid partitioning into phospholipids and neutral lipids. analysis of
fatty acid partitioning into cellular lipids was measured as [14c]-oa, [14c]glycerol, and [3h]-aa incorporation into phospholipids, diacylglycerol (dag),
and triacylglycerol (tag) after separation by thin-layer chromatography, as
previously described (16). for analysis of aa incorporation, neutral and
phospholipid spots were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor, scraped, and
quantified via liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
adenoviral infection of human smcs. the dominant-negative form of
ppar-␥ harbors mutations of leu468 and glu471 of the full-length ppar-␥1
sequence into ala and has been shown to block the effects of endogenous
ppar-␥ in different cells (18,19). this ppar-␥ mutant retains ligand and dna
binding, but exhibits markedly reduced transactivation due to impaired
co-activator recruitment (18). the dominant-negative ppar-␥ was subcloned
into a recombinant type 5 adenovirus (adx-d/n-ppar-␥). an adenovirus
expressing the lacz gene was used as a control vector. human smcs were
infected with 40 plaque-forming units/cell via a modified protocol by bruemmer et al. (20).
statistical analysis. values are shown as means ⫾ se. curve fitting and data
analysis were performed using graphpad prism (graphpad, san diego, ca).
statistical significance of difference was assessed by either one-way or
two-way anova and, in some experiments, the student’s t test. simultaneous
multiple comparisons were based on a post hoc comparison test using a
student-newman-keuls test.

acsl1_v,  xxxg47xxx  variant.

each isoform (table 1), we amplified mrna for the
different acsl isoforms. human smcs and monocytederived macrophages expressed  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx ,  xxxg49xxx ,
and acsl5 mrna (fig. 1a). in hsmcs, the  xxxg47xxx  splice
variant 1 and 2 primers detected a band of the correct size,
whereas  xxxg47xxx  variant 3 was not detected (data not
shown). detectable levels of acsl5 mrna were found in
hsmcs at cycle numbers above 30 (data not shown).
murine smcs expressed  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  mrna, and
murine peritoneal macrophages expressed  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx ,
and  xxxg49xxx  mrna. none of the acsl6 splice variants were
detected in any of the cell types studied (fig. 1a).
antibodies that recognize human and murine acsls are
not yet available for all isoforms. however, an anti-rat
 xxxg47xxx  antibody recognized a band of the predicted 68 kda
in high-speed supernatant from rat liver (fig. 1b) and in
human and murine smcs, monocyte-derived macrophages, and murine peritoneal macrophages (fig. 1b). the
 xxxg49xxx  antibody recognized a band of 74 kda in hsmcs that
co-migrated with recombinant rat  xxxg49xxx  (fig. 1c; upper
panel).  xxxg49xxx  was expressed in hsmcs and monocytederived macrophages and in murine smcs, while no band
was seen in murine peritoneal macrophages (fig. 1c;
lower panel).

analysis of total acsl activity in smcs and macrophages. previous studies have demonstrated that tzds
directly inhibit recombinant  xxxg49xxx  activity (10,21). this
effect is selective to the  xxxg49xxx  isoform, because recombinant  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx , acsl5, and acsl6 are not inhibited by
rosiglitazone until concentrations of ⬎10 ␮mol/l are
reached (10,21). furthermore, rosiglitazone has not been
reported to affect other enzymes with acyl-coa synthetase
activity, such as the fatty acid transport proteins. triacsin
c, an alkenyl-n-hydrozytrazene fungal metabolite, inhibits
 xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg48xxx , and  xxxg49xxx , but not acsl5 and acsl6 activity, at
concentrations ⬍10 ␮mol/l (10,21).
initially, the ability of rosiglitazone to inhibit acsl
activity in cell lysates was evaluated. rosiglitazone dosedependently inhibited acsl activity in both human and
murine smcs (fig. 2a and e). the non-tzd ppar-␥ ligand
15dpgj2, the ppar-␣ agonist wy14643, and the ampk
activator aicar had no effect on acsl activity at the
concentrations tested (table 2). rosiglitazone did not
inhibit acsl activity in murine peritoneal macrophages at
concentrations up to 100 ␮mol/l, consistent with the
nondetectable expression of  xxxg49xxx  protein in these cells
(fig. 2g). however, contrary to the effects seen in murine
macrophages, rosiglitazone inhibited acsl activity in human monocyte– derived macrophages (fig. 2c).

products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized via ethidium bromide staining.  xxxg47xxx  (b) and  xxxg49xxx  (c) protein expression was
evaluated by western blot analysis. cell lysates (60 ␮g/lane) were separated using 7.5% sds-page and probed with anti-rat  xxxg47xxx  or  xxxg49xxx 
antibodies (1:10,000). the blots were re-probed with an anti–␤-actin antibody (sigma) at a 1:10,000 dilution (c, lower panel). recombinant rat

phages. we had previously demonstrated, using thin-layer
and high-performance liquid chromatography, that in
smcs, oa is incorporated into phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine), monoglycerides, dag, and tag (16,22). in this
study, we analyzed the effects of rosiglitazone and triacsin
c on the kinetics of oa incorporation into these lipid
pools. as seen in our previous studies, [14c]-oa was
incorporated into cellular phospholipids, dag, tag, and,
to a small degree, cholesteryl esters in hsmcs (fig. 3a and
b). however, the kinetics of oa incorporation into these
pools were distinctly different. oa incorporation into
phospholipids occurred rapidly (⬍2 min), while incorporation into dag was first observed at the 5-min time point

and reached a maximum after 4 h (fig. 3a and b).
incorporation into tag was first observed at the 1-h time
point (fig. 3a and b) and reached a maximum at 6 h (data
not shown).
in hsmcs, preincubation with rosiglitazone caused an
initial decrease of ⬃30% in oa incorporation into phospholipids (2–5 min after addition of oa; figs. 3a and 4).
this effect is most likely due to inhibition of phospholipid
re-acylation because de novo phospholipid synthesis was
undetectable at these time points (data not shown). furthermore, in hsmcs (figs. 3a and 5a) and macrophages
(fig. 5c), rosiglitazone inhibited [14c]-oa incorporation
into dag and tag. similarly, [14c]-glycerol incorporation
into tag was also inhibited by rosiglitazone in smcs
(65.2 ⫾ 3.3% of untreated control, p ⬍ 0.01), indicating the
attenuation observed is due to a decrease in de novo tag
formation. similar results were seen with [3h]-aa–treated

activator aicar (data not shown) were without effect.
thus, rosiglitazone results in a transient inhibition of
phospholipid reacylation and a more sustained inhibition
of dag and tag synthesis in hsmcs. as expected, rosiglitazone had no effect on [14c]-oa incorporation into
these lipid pools in murine peritoneal macrophages (fig.
5d).
triacsin c was used as a positive control to investigate
the role of triacsin c–sensitive acsl isoforms in smcs and
macrophages. preincubation with triacsin c dramatically
attenuated oa and aa incorporation into the dag, tag,
and phospholipids (figs. 3b, 4, and 5a and b) in hsmcs.
as with rosiglitazone, the inhibitory effects of triacsin c on
[14c]-oa incorporation into phospholipids were seen early
(2–5 min) after addition of the fatty acid, at a time when
[14c]-glycerol incorporation was not detectable, indicating
that this effect was due to inhibition of phospholipid
reacylation (figs. 3b and 4). at later times, preincubation
with triacsin c also attenuated [14c]-glycerol incorporation into phospholipids (8.6 ⫾ 2.8% of control; p ⬍ 0.05),
indicating that both reacylation and de novo pathways of
phospholipid synthesis were inhibited.
as in hsmcs, triacsin c significantly attenuated [14c]-oa
incorporation into the phospholipid, dag, and tag pools
in human monocyte– derived macrophages (fig. 5c). similarly, in murine peritoneal macrophages, triacsin c inhibdiabetes, vol. 56, april 2007

some of the effects of rosiglitazone, but in addition has

on oa incorporation into dag and tag in hsmcs were
not mediated by ppar-␥ activation, we used two approaches. first, hsmcs were treated with t0070907, a
noncompetitive antagonist of ppar-␥ (23). rosiglitazone
caused a 50% decrease in oa incorporation into dag, an
effect that was not influenced by pretreatment with
t0070907 (fig. 6a). interestingly, while treatment with the
noncompetitive inhibitor alone attenuated oa incorporation into tag, it had no effect on the rosiglitazone-induced
effects. second, we transfected hsmcs with an adenovirus
containing a dominant-negative ppar-␥ mutant. similar to
t0070907, neither treatment with an adenovirus-containdiabetes, vol. 56, april 2007

discussion

rosiglitazone directly inhibits acsl activity and
fatty acid partitioning into dag and tag through a
ppar-␥–independent mechanism. the main finding of
this report is that rosiglitazone inhibits acsl activity and
fatty acid partitioning into dag and tag in human smcs
and macrophages through a ppar-␥–independent mecha1149

fig. 6. inhibition of ppar-␥ does not block the inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone on fatty acid partitioning into dag and tag. human smcs were

plaque-forming units/cell of a dominant-negative ppar-␥ mutant (adx-d/n-ppar␥) or control (adx-lacz) (b). the smcs were then incubated

nism. several findings point to a direct inhibition of  xxxg49xxx 
enzymatic activity as a mechanism of action of rosiglitazone on fatty acid partitioning. first, recombinant rat
 xxxg49xxx  activity is inhibited by tzds through a mixed-type
inhibition with respect to all of its substrates: fatty acid,
coa, and atp (10). of all the ascl isoforms, only  xxxg49xxx 
is inhibited by rosiglitazone (10,21). second, human smcs
and macrophages and murine smcs express  xxxg49xxx , and
rosiglitazone inhibited acsl activity in cell lysates,
whereas murine macrophages did not express  xxxg49xxx  and
were insensitive to the effects of rosiglitazone on acute
fatty acid partitioning. third, the effect of rosiglitazone on
acsl activity and fatty acid partitioning into dag and
tag was not mimicked by the ppar-␥ agonist 15-dpgj2,
the ppar-␣ agonist wy14643, or the ampk activator
aicar. finally, the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone on
oa partitioning into dag and tag were not blocked by
pharmacological inhibition of ppar-␥ nor by inhibition of
ppar-␥ action by expression of a dominant-negative
ppar-␥ mutant. thus, in addition to the well-described
ability of rosiglitazone and other tzds to activate ampk
(9,24) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (25),
 xxxg49xxx  appears to be an important contributor to the
ppar-␥–independent effects of rosiglitazone, at least in
human and murine smcs and in human macrophages. in
1150

fact, it is possible that the ability of rosiglitazone to
activate ampk might be due to its inhibitory action on
 xxxg49xxx .  xxxg49xxx  is highly expressed in peroxisomes and
mitochondrial-associated membranes and may be important in activating  xxxd2154xxx  for peroxisomal oxidation
(26). activity of ampk, which is regulated by changes in
the amp:atp ratio, might be upregulated by a reduced
 xxxg49xxx  activity, leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation.
rosiglitazone-induced inhibition of  xxxg49xxx  may have
important biological effects in human macrophages and
smcs. interestingly, aa is one of the preferred substrates
for recombinant  xxxg49xxx  (27), and uterine tissues isolated
from  xxxg49xxx ⫹/⫺ mice show increased levels of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) and 6-keto-pgf1␣ (prostaglandin f1␣) (28).
it is therefore possible that inhibition of aa re-acylation by
rosiglitazone-mediated  xxxg49xxx  inhibition may lead to increased levels of bioactive eicosanoids in the vascular
wall. indeed, rosiglitazone increases lipopolysaccarideinduced prostanoid production in the human monocytic
cell line u937 (29). on the other hand, the ppar-␥–
mediated effects of rosiglitazone are likely to increase
cellular fatty acid uptake. for example, in adipocytes,
rosiglitazone induces the expression of oxidized ldl
receptor-1, which not only increases ldl uptake but also
increases fatty acid uptake (30). cd36 is another ppar-␥

target gene induced by rosiglitazone in macrophages (31).
cd36 can act as a fatty acid transporter (32), and increased expression therefore might increase fatty acid
uptake. overall, these studies show that several different
pathways are likely to mediate the effects of rosiglitazone
on fatty acid metabolism in macrophages and smcs.
the concentrations of rosiglitazone used in the present
study are similar to maximal plasma concentrations (1.1
␮mol/l) achieved in humans by oral dosing of 8 mg/day
(33) and are also similar to concentrations found to
activate ampk. thus, rosiglitazone inhibits acsl activity
with an average ic50 of 15.5 ␮mol/l in hsmcs (this study)
and activates ampk in the skeletal muscle cell line h-2kb
above 5 ␮mol/l (9). therefore, the clinical effects of
rosiglitazone, as well as other tzds, may well be mediated
not only by activation of ppar-␥, but also by activation of
ampk and inhibition of  xxxg49xxx .
do the different acsl isoforms have distinct functions in smcs and macrophages? based on differences
in subcellular localization, regulation, tissue distribution,
and fatty acid substrate preferences, it has been proposed
that the different acsl gene products channel  xxxd2154xxx 
to different fates in the cell (34). although this hypothesis
will have to be carefully addressed, our data appear to
support this notion, but also indicate that there is no
absolute specificity in acsl isoform function. inhibition of
 xxxg49xxx  by rosiglitazone resulted in an inhibition of fatty
acid partitioning into dag and tag in both human smcs
and macrophages. inhibition of  xxxg49xxx  has only a minor
and transient effect on fatty acid partitioning into phospholipids. this appears to be primarily an effect on the
re-acylation pathway, as our experiments demonstrated
no [14c]-glycerol incorporation at these early time points
(data not shown). in contrast, triacsin c, which inhibits
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg48xxx  in addition to  xxxg49xxx , had dramatic
effects on fatty acid partitioning into all lipid pools,
including phospholipids. although triacsin c might affect
other fatty acid– binding proteins in the cell, these results
suggest that  xxxg49xxx  is involved in de novo synthesis of
dag and fatty acid storage in tag and that  xxxg47xxx  and/or
 xxxg48xxx  have additional effects on fatty acid partitioning
into phospholipids.
however, our results on murine macrophages show that
in some cell types, one acsl isoform appears sufficient to
mediate fatty acid partitioning into all lipid pools, in
addition to other fates, such as peroxisomal and mitochondrial ␤-oxidation. in these cells, although  xxxg47xxx  is the
principal isoform expressed at detectable levels, murine
macrophages efficiently incorporate  xxxd2154xxx  into all
lipid pools.
there are important species differences in acsl
expression profiles in macrophages. our results also
demonstrate that human monocyte– derived macrophages
express  xxxg49xxx  and exhibit sensitivity to rosiglitazoneinhibited fatty acid partitioning, whereas murine thioglycollate– elicited macrophages do not. while this study
compared human monocyte– derived macrophages and
murine thioglycollate– elicited peritoneal macrophages,
preliminary studies in our laboratory show that bone
marrow– derived macrophages from mice exhibit an acsl
expression profile very similar to that of murine peritoneal
macrophages, indicating that the source of macrophages
does not significantly alter the acsl expression profile (j.e.
kanter and k.e. bornfeldt, unpublished data). important
species differences have previously been demonstrated for
diabetes, vol. 56, april 2007

other enzymes, such as the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (35).
tzds have been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in
diabetic and insulin-resistant mice (36,37). however, while
rosiglitazone reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes, it
did not reduce the rate of myocardial infarction or stroke
in the dream trial (38). on the contrary, patients receiving rosiglitazone developed more frequent congestive
heart failure (38). one could speculate that the fact that
rosiglitazone has several targets in addition to ppar-␥,
including  xxxg49xxx , might potentially explain the lack of
beneficial cardiovascular effects in humans despite promising effects on atherosclerosis in mice (36,37). it will
therefore be important to verify results obtained in murine
models on isolated human macrophages and in clinical
trials.
