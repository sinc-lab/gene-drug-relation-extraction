[receptors involved in the mechanism of action of topical prostaglandines].  hypotensive effect to prostaglandins analogs ( xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd3274xxx ) means to increase uveoscleral outflow by action to fp receptors who generated extracellular matrix changes and intermuscular spaces changes. syntetic prostamides analogs ( xxxd340xxx ) have a particulary action with a receptors most and intensive studied. the  xxxd340xxx  effect is the consequences to preferated stimulations on the specific receptors who have action only the tissue with prostaglandins activity is important to specify what the  xxxd340xxx  have dual effect: to uveoscleral outflow and classic outflow by increase hidraulic conductivity.
