abstract
 xxxd1927xxx  is a  xxxg656xxx  antogonist, which has been used as antiemetic agent in human beings. it has been found in
wastewater released by some pharmaceutical industries leading to the contamination of surface and ground water. therefore, a sensitive,
inexpensive and reproducible hplc-spe method was developed for the analysis of  xxxd1927xxx  in the wastewater. the column used was
waters symmetry c18 (15 cm × 0.46 mm, 5 ␮m). the mobile phase used was phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 3.5) acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) at
the flow rate 2.0 ml/min. the detection was achieved by using uv mode at 230 nm. the retention, separation and resolution factors were
2.63, 3.00 and 3.20, respectively. the percentage recovery of  xxxd1927xxx  from wastewater was 95.0%.  xxxd458xxx  was used as the internal
standard to access the percentage extraction of  xxxd1927xxx  from wastewater.

1. introduction
drugs are life saving catalysts but their unnecessary
administration into human body is not desirable. many drug
residues have been found in water and the analysis of drug
residues is the recent area and increasing its importance day
by day [1]. the undesired administration of many drugs into
human body possesses certain side effects and also alter
the body biological activities leading into notorious effect
on the health [2].  xxxd1927xxx  is a  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist used as antiemetic agent into human beings for
preventing nausea and vomiting [3–5]. it is being used widely
all over the world for its unique pharmaceutical activity. some
pharmaceutical industries and hospitals are discharging  xxxd1927xxx  in their effluents resulting into the contamination of
our natural water resources. the presence of any undesirable
biodegradable and non-biodegradable constituent into water

and other foodstuffs is not desirable [6] and called as pollutant. therefore, the analysis of domperiodone into wastewater
is required and urgent needed. some hplc methods are
available on the determination of  xxxd1927xxx  in biological
samples [7–13] but no report is available on its analysis in
surface/wastewater. therefore, attempts are made to develop
fast, sensitive, selective and reproducible methods for its
analysis into wastewater. the present research describes the
analysis of  xxxd1927xxx , which is in the wastewater by using
solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography methodologies.

2. experimental
2.1. materials and equipments
 xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  (fig. 1) were obtained from
kyowa hakko, japan and sigma chem. co., usa. purified water was prepared by millipore milli-q (bedford, ma,

usa). acetonitrile, methanol, acetone, acetic acid reagents
were purchased from merck, bombay, india. ph was adjusted
with a ph meter (hach, loveland co., usa). spe was carried out using c18 sep-pak vac (1.0 ml) cartridge, which
was obtained from waters, milford massachusetts, usa.
hplc system (shimadzu, japan) consisting of solvent delivery pump (model lc-10ad), injector (model sc), uv–vis
absorbance detector (model spd-10a) and hp laser jet printer
was used for this work. the software used in this hplc system was agilent lc chemstation.

2.2.2. analysis by hplc
an aliquot of 5.0 ␮l of a standard mixture of  xxxd1927xxx 
and  xxxd458xxx  (0.10 mg/ml of each in ethanol) was injected
on to a hplc system described above. the column used was
symmetry c18 (15 cm × 0.46 mm, 5 ␮m) and obtained from
waters, usa. the mobile phase used was phosphate buffer
(50 mm, ph 3.5) – acetonitrile (80:20, v/v). the mobile phase
was filtered and degassed before the use. the flow rate of the
mobile phase was 2.0 ml/min under isocratic conditions. all
the experiments were carried out at 27 ± 1 ◦ c with column
operated at room temperature. the detection was carried out
at 230 nm. the peaks of  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  were
identified by their retention times.  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  in wastewater sample were identified by comparing their
retention times with those of standards. the peaks of these
molecules were also confirmed by internal addition method.
the percentage recovery of  xxxd1927xxx  into wastewater was
calculated by using  xxxd458xxx  (internal addition method). the
chromatographic parameters such as retention factor (k), separation factor (alpha) and resolution factor (rs ) were calculated
[14,15]. the quantitative determination of  xxxd1927xxx  was
calculated as given below:
concentration of  xxxd1927xxx  =

cstd × asamp
astd

in wastewater sample, where cstd is the concentration into
standard, asamp the peak area of sample and astd is the peak
area of standard.

2.2. methodology

3. results and discussion

2.2.1. solid phase extraction
to determine the percentage recovery of  xxxd1927xxx  in
the wastewater, celiporolol was used as the internal standard.
1.0 ml solutions of  xxxd458xxx  (0.01 mg/ml in ethanol) was
mixed in 1.0 l of tap water. this mixture was shaked for about
5 min manually and kept at room temperature for over night.
c18 cartridge (1.0 ml capacity) was pre-conditioned using
methanol (1.0 ml) followed by water (1.0 ml) for 5 min.
1.0 l of the spiked water sample was passed through this cartridge at 50.0 ml/min flow rate. cartridge was washed with
2.0 ml of deionized water and  xxxd458xxx  was eluted with
methanol (1.0 ml) thrice at 0.50 ml/min flow rate. three
fractions of eluted methanol (1.0 ml each extracted three
times) were combined together. besides, the elution was
also tried with other solvents such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, acetone and ethyl acetate. this methodology was
applied to the natural condition by replacing tap water with
wastewater. wastewater sample was collected from municipal discharge and filtered through whatman filter papers
no. 24. the filtered wastewater sample (1 l) was spiked
with 0.1 mg/l  xxxd458xxx  and treated as in case of tap water.
after determining the repeatability and percentage recovery
of  xxxd458xxx , the same spe extraction procedure was used
for  xxxd1927xxx  extraction from wastewater.

3.1. solid phase extraction
the recoveries of  xxxd1927xxx  from tap and wastewater
samples were 96.0 and 95.0% indicating a good efficiency
of solid phase extraction methods. the slightly lower values of recoveries in the wastewater may be due the presence
of other impurities in the wastewater. no other peaks were
observed into hplc chromatogram showing the selectivity of spe. spe was optimized by using different eluting
solvents (ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, diethylether, chloroform, hexane and dichloromethan), ph of wastewater, flow
of eluting solvents and other factors. as a result of extensive
experiments the optimized spe conditions were developed
and reported herein.
3.2. chromatography
retention factor (k), separation factor (alpha) and resolution
factor (rs ) for the separated  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  in
tap and wastewater samples are given in table 1. the chromatograms for the separated  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx , in
tap and wastewater samples are given in figs. 2 and 3, respectively. it is clear from table 1 that the values of separation and
resolution factors for  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  are 3.0 and

– acetonitrile (80:20, v/v).

3.2 in tap water samples while these values were reported
as 2.96 and 3.15 in the wastewater samples. these values
and a look of figs. 2 and 3 clearly indicate a good separation of  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd458xxx  in tap and wastewater,
respectively. a variation in these values may be because of
the interference due to the impurities in the wastewater. a
variation in the chromatographic parameters was carried out
to obtain the best resolution by using various mixtures of
buffer and acetonitrile. as a result of extensive experiments
the optimized chromatographic conditions were developed
and reported herein.

the validation of spe and hplc methodologies was confirmed by carrying out these experiments three times (n = 3)
under the identical experimental conditions. the regression
analysis was carried out using microsoft excel program. the
values of standard deviations obtained were ±0.15 to ±0.18
and ±0.21 to ±0.25 for hplc (retention times) and spe
(percentage recoveries) methods, respectively. the values of
the correlation coefficients (r2 ) were 0.9999 and 0.9998 for
hplc and spe methods, respectively. the confidence levels were 98.0–99.0% and 97.0–98.0% for spe and hplc
methods, respectively. the limit of detection (lod) and the
limit of quantitation (loq) were determined as three and five
times the baseline noise, respectively, following the united
states pharmacopoeia [16]. the values of limit of detection
and limit of quantification were 10 and 50 ␮g/ml, respectively. these values of validation parameters indicate good
reproducibilities of spe and hplc methodologies.

5. conclusion
the reported spe and hplc methods are rapid, selective,
reproducible and inexpensive in the nature. the percentage
extraction of  xxxd1927xxx  from wastewater is quite good
(95.0%). therefore, these methods can be used for the analysis of  xxxd1927xxx  in waste, surface, ground and mineral
water samples satisfactorily.
