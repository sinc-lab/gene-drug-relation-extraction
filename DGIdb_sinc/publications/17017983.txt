abstract:  xxxd2561xxx  was launched as a major new nsaid for the treatment of arthritis following extensive published
research confirming its selectivity for cox-2. several studies proposed possible explanations for its effectiveness and superior safety profile. the proposed theories included chemical structural relationships between  xxxd2561xxx  and other effective nsaids with low gastrointestinal toxic effects. however, other oxicams have similar chemical groups, but despite
this, are not considered cox-2 selective drugs and exhibit less gastric tolerance. hence, the aim of this work was to investigate the interactions between oxicams and biomembrane models as it could influence their resorption from the upper
gastrointestinal tract and may affect their local gastromucosal tolerability.
the partition of oxicams within membranes was determined by calculating their partition coefficients between liposomes
and water. moreover, their location within the bilayer was determined by fluorescence quenching. finally, zeta-potential
measurements were made to complete the information about the binding behaviour of the oxicams and steady-state anisotropy measurements were made to determine their induced perturbation in membrane structure. these studies proved that,
in spite of structural similarities, oxicams present different interactions with membranes making possible a virtual division
of the class in two groups.  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  known as cox-1 inhibitors demonstrated higher partition capacity
in liposomes/water systems together with a smaller ability to change the membrane fluidity and surface potential. in contrast  xxxd2508xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx , which demonstrated activity against cox-2, have revealed smaller partition capacity in
liposomes/water systems together with a higher ability to change the membrane fluidity and surface potential.

introduction
non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, nsaids, are a
chemically heterogeneous group of agents possessing a common property of being endogenous prostaglandins (pgs)
synthesis inhibitors via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase
(cox) enzyme, an action that has been generally accepted as
the principal mechanism by which these drugs act [1-4]. recently, it has been established that cox enzyme has two
isoforms (constitutive cox-1 and the inducible cox-2) and
current thinking suggests that inhibition of cox-1 is involved directly in the side effects of nsaids while the
therapeutically desirable effects come from inhibition of
cox-2 [5, 6]. nevertheless, the notion that a highly selective
cox-2 inhibitor will alone lead to low gastroulcerogenicity
is open to question and no clear correlation has been found
between the inhibition of cox-1 activity by nsaids and
damaging effects on gastrointestinal function [7]. in fact,
there are several currently available nsaids that have appreciable cox-1–inhibitory activity as well as cox-2 effects that have relatively low gastrointestinal ulcerogenicity
[8, 9].
another intriguing aspect about nsaids’ varying degrees of toxicity and anti-inflammatory activity is that these

effects occur not only in structurally unrelated compounds,
but also within homologous series of nsaid “families”.
nsaids of the  xxxd3311xxx  group are conventionally known as a
highly effective class of drugs against various arthritis and
postoperative inflammations [10], but despite their similar
chemical structures, they have different biological effects.
indeed, in addition to high anti-inflammatory efficacy,  xxxd2561xxx , which is a member of  xxxd3311xxx  class, appears to have
low ulcerogenic potency and exhibits less gastric and local
tissue irritation in comparison to other nsaids, including
other oxicams. many authors have tried to establish what
factors may account for the apparent low ulcerogenicity of
 xxxd2561xxx  [11, 12]. some authors considered that the good
tolerability profile may be explained by the proved ability of
 xxxd2561xxx  to preferentially inhibit cox-2 [13-15]. other
authors proposed that the chemical structures of the cox-2
inhibitors (including  xxxd2561xxx ) have sulfa moieties [16]
that clearly distinguish them from conventional carboxylic
acids or ketoenolic acids that characterize non selective
cox-2 inhibitors (fig. 1).
this chemical difference would permit the inhibition of
the cox-2 enzyme possibly exploiting increased flexibility
of the inner shell of the roof of the enzyme [17]. also, because of the sulfa moieties present in cox-2–selective
nsaids, some authors proposed that these compounds had
much higher pka values than are normally encountered in
cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors and this might contribute for the
low local mucosal irritancy observed with these drugs inde© 2006 bentham science publishers ltd.

pendent of their cox-2 selectivity [18, 19]. still, despite
these suggested theories, for unexplained reasons the other
oxicams which have the same sulfa-moieties encountered for
 xxxd2561xxx , fig. 1, are not considered cox-2 selective drugs
and exhibit less gastric tolerance [14]. consequently, it is
clear that the pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage is complex, and there are also other important
non-prostaglandin-mediated effects to the damage, including
the “topical” effect, which may result from an interaction
between nsaids and surface phospholipids of the gastrointestinal membranes [20-23], together with the systemic and
local effects caused by inhibition of membrane bound enzyme cox. although the precise details concerning the explanation of nsaids toxic and therapeutic actions has yet to
be fully established, there is consensual evidence that their
lipid affinity is of major significance. indeed, depending on
their hydrolipophilic character, nsaids can be distributed
between the membrane and the aqueous phases and this distribution determines their concentration in each phase and
thereby controls the extents of their penetration into the
membrane and/or interactions with phospholipids or other
membrane components such as cox enzymes which are
embedded in the lipid bilayers.
therefore the aim of this work was to investigate the
interactions between four oxicams ( xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2508xxx ,
 xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx ) and biomembrane models once
that it might be relevant for understanding the apparently
contrasting behaviour of  xxxd2561xxx .
firstly, the partition of oxicams within membranes was
determined by calculating their partition coefficients (kp)
between lipid bilayers of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine
(epc) unilamellar liposomes (luvs) and water, using two
different experimental techniques: derivative spectropho-

tometry and fluorescence quenching. moreover, the location
of this group of nsaids within the bilayer was also determined by fluorescence quenching using a set of n-(9anthroyloxy) fatty acid probes (n=2, 6, 9 and 12), which contain the same fluorescent group, but bounded at different
positions of an alkyl chain (bound to c2 in 2-as; to c6 in 6as; to c9 in 9-as and to c12 in 12-as). thus the fluorophores report the environment at a graded series of depths within
the host lipid structure making possible a precise mapping of
the nsaids according to differences in its quenching efficiencies [24].
additionally, zeta-potential measurements were made, as
it is important to know the influence of the drugs in the
membrane surface potential, which gives an indication of the
type of interactions that exist between drugs and the lipid
bilayer surface.
finally, as modifications of physical characteristics of the
membrane lipid bilayer, by means of membrane fluidity may
lead to disruption of phospholipid layers, and this may underlie the topical irritancy in the gastrointestinal mucosa presented by nsaids [25], steady-state anisotropy measurements were used to determine the oxicams’ induced perturbation in membrane structure at different depths of the bilayer. in these studies, the same set of n-as probes were
used, as they offer the possibility of studying the fluidity
gradient in model membranes [26-28].

drug location studies by fluorescence quenching

preparation and fluorescence labelling of liposomes
liposomes were prepared by evaporation to dryness of a
lipid solution in chloroform/methanol (9:1) with a stream of
nitrogen; the lipid film was then left under vacuum overnight
to remove traces of the organic solvents. the resultant dried
lipid film was dispersed into a buffer (hepes: 10 mm, i=0.1
m, ph 7.4) and the mixture was vortexed to yield multilamellar vesicles. lipid suspensions were then equilibrated at
25.0 + 0.1 ºc for 30 min and were further extruded 10 times
through polycarbonate filters with a pore diameter of 100 nm
to form luvs [29]. epc concentration in vesicle suspensions was determined by phosphate analysis using the phosphomolybdate method [30].
the fluorescence probes were dissolved in ethanol and
added to a suspension of pre-formed liposomes with gentle
mixing. the ratio of lipid to probe was always greater than
100:1 to prevent changes in the structure of the liposome
membranes [31], and to ensure complete incorporation of the
probe in the lipid bilayer the suspensions were left for 30
minutes.
determination of partition coefficients by derivative
spectrophotometry and fluorescence quenching
the oxicams’ partition coefficients values (kp) were determined in luvs suspensions at ph 7.4. in the derivative
spectrophotometry studies, buffered solution (hepes: 10
mm, i = 0.1 m, ph 7.4) of nsaids were added to liposome
suspensions prepared as described above; the final drug concentration was 22 m for  xxxd2508xxx ; 47 m for  xxxd2561xxx ; 30 m for  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  while the epc
concentration ranged from 0 to 1000 m. the resulting suspensions were incubated in the dark for 30 min. after equilibration, the absorption spectra were recorded at 25.0+0.1ºc
with a perkin elmer lambda 45 uv/vis spectrophotometer,
in the 200-400 nm range and using quartz cells with a 1-cm
path length.
in fluorescence quenching studies, buffered solutions
(hepes: 10mm, i=0.1 m, ph 7.4) of nsaids were added to
liposomes prepared with the 12-as probe as described
above. final concentration range of epc was from 50 to
1000 m. for each epc concentration, the oxicams were
added in final concentration ranges:  xxxd2508xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  from 0 to 60 m;  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  from 0 to 50
m. the resulting suspensions were incubated in the dark for

and  xxxd2561xxx  and 0-40 m for  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx .
the resulting suspensions were incubated in the dark for 2 h.
fluorescence intensity measurements were made using a

25.0 + 0.1ºc. excitation wavelength was set to 384 nm and
emission wavelength to 446 nm for 12-as; to 448 nm for 9as; to 449 nm for 6-as and to 452 nm for 2-as. fluorescence intensity values were corrected for absorbance of the
quencher (nsaid) at the excitation wavelength [32].
membrane fluidity studies by fluorescence anisotropy
measurements
steady-state anisotropy measurements ( rss ) were performed in the same perkin elmer  xxxd2814xxx  spectrofluorimeter
with polarizers inserted (excitation/emission wavelengths
and slits were set as described). the sample was excited with
vertically polarized light and fluorescence intensities were
recorded with the analysing polarizer oriented parallel ( i || )
and perpendicular ( i  ) to the excitation polarizer. these
values were used to calculate steady-state anisotropy ( rss )
[24]:

rss =

i ||  gi 
i || + 2gi 

where g is an instrumental correction factor [24]. readings
were taken with an integration time of 50 s.
zeta-potential measurements
the zeta-potential (-potential) values of the vesicles,
with and without incorporated drug, were determined at ph
7.4 (hepes buffer), at 25.0 + 0.1 ºc, by quasi-elastic light
scattering analysis using a zet 5104 cell in a malvern zetasizer 5000, with a 90º scattering angle. lipid concentration
was kept constant at 500 m. the nsaids were added to
obtain a concentration range from 0 to 300 m for  xxxd2508xxx  and 0 to 1000 m for  xxxd2561xxx . the very low solubility of  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  required the use of
(ch3)2so:water solutions (1:99 v/v) to obtain a concentration range from 0 to 400 m for  xxxd3311xxx  and 0 to 300 m
for  xxxd2969xxx ; with this solvent composition no membrane
damage occurs [33]. reference solutions without drug were
prepared to ensure that -potential values were not modified
by the presence of dmso.

determination of partition coefficients by derivative
spectrophotometry
spectrophotometric analysis of heterogeneous media
containing vesicles is hampered by the strong spectral interference caused by light scattering, which must be eliminated
before partition coefficients can be calculated. the use of
second derivative spectrophotometry allowed for total elimination of background signal effects arising from light scattered by lipid vesicles, without the need of separation techniques that may disturb equilibrium states [34-36].
considering the definition of the molar partition coefficient of a drug between lipid bilayer vesicles suspensions
and aqueous solution (kp) [37] and the observation that the
absorbance of a drug in a suspension containing liposomes
with different lipid concentrations [lipid] is: absf = absm +
absa, where absm is the absorbance calculated assuming that
all drug is membrane bound and absa is the absorbance of
the drug in buffer solution without lipid, then the following
expression can be obtained [34, 35]:

abs f = absa +

( absm  absa ) k p [ lipid ] v
1 + k p [ lipid ] v

(2)

a formally identical expression can be used for derivative spectroscopy, but with abs replaced by d=(dnabs)/
(dn). the partition coefficients are calculated by fitting
equation (2) to the experimental data (df versus [lipid]),
using a non-linear regression method, where the adjustable
parameter is kp. for epc, v = 0.688 (in lmol-1), and the
mean molecular weight is 700 [38].

determination of partition coefficients by fluorescence
quenching
quenching of fluorescence can be described by the classic stern-volmer equation [24, 39-47]. however, when the
oxicams (quencher) are distributed between membrane and
aqueous phase and only the total quencher concentration is
known, the stern-volmer equation can be written as:

i0
app
= 1 + k sv
[q ]t
i

(3)

where i0 and i are, respectively, the corrected fluorescence
intensity of the fluorophores (n-as probe) in the absence and
presence of the drug; [q]t is the total quencher concentration
(given by the sum of concentrations in aqueous and membrane phases) and the stern-volmer constant, ksv, is replaced
app
app
[46]. the k sv
by the apparent stern-volmer constant, k sv
values depend not only on the quencher efficiency but also
on its partition coefficient (kp) between the aqueous and the
lipid phases, and this dependence is described by the equation [46]:

1
1
1
=
+
vm
app
k sv
k sv  k p k sv

(4)

plotting the left hand term against vm (i.e. a range of lipid
concentrations) allows ksv to be determined from the slope
and kp from the intercept (table 1).
as observed in table 1, the kp values obtained by both
techniques are much higher for  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx 
than for  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2508xxx .
location studies by fluorescence quenching
in practice, the quenching efficiency of the oxicams was
evaluated by addition of increasing amounts of drug to
liposome suspensions with incorporated n-as probes. as a
result, the fluorescence decreased without causing significant
changes in the probes spectral shape (data not shown) and
that demonstrates that quenching of n-as probes by oxicams
occurs by a collisional mechanism [48]. fig. 3 is an example
of the decrease in fluorescence intensity of n-as probes in
epc unilamellar liposomes (500 m, ph 7.4) by increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2508xxx .
considering this quenching process as collisional, the
change in fluorescence is related to the concentration of
quencher by equation 3 which can be plotted as a linear function of io/i versus [q]t.the slopes of the stern-volmer plots
correspond to the values of apparent stern-volmer constant, k svapp , for oxicams, which are included in table 2.
the use of this set of probes to determine drug location in
the bilayer is based on the assumption that all probes have
the same intrinsic quenching efficiency [44]. this is true in
homogeneous solvents, but in phospholipid bilayers the existence of fluidity and gradient through the plane of membrane
is evident. consequently, it is advisable to calculate bimolecular quenching constant, kq (table 2), which reflects the
accessibility of the quencher to the fluorophore and eliminates the microenvironment differences surrounding the
probes. this parameter can be determined using the value of

membrane fluidity studies by fluorescence anisotropy
measurements
steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements have
been widely used to study the influence of several drugs in
membrane fluidity and the results are often analysed according to the perrin equation which relates measured anisotropy
to the rotational relaxation time (  ) of the fluorophore; its
the fluorescence lifetime (  ), and the fundamental anisotropy of the fluorescent molecule ( r0 ) [24]:

r=

r0
1 + (  )

(6)

however, these simple data treatments are incorrect, once
that perrin equation applies only to isotropic rotation of a
fluorophore and is not applicable to the anisotropic rotation
of the probes in lipid bilayers [24]. therefore, fluorescent
probes can provide reliable qualitative data on overall
changes in bilayer fluidity, but it is advisable some caution in
literally interpreting data obtained, since that changes in fluidity due to perturbers are not uniform at all segments of the
acyl chain and that the probe itself strongly influences the
data [24]. in order to provide a sound basis of unambiguous
interpretations of the fluorescence probe experiments it is
necessary to consider appropriate corrections to experimental
data. complete details of the theory of steady-state anisotropy and its corrections have been described elsewhere [54].
the major problem in the study of membrane fluidity by
steady-state fluorescence anisotropy is the existence of hindered rotational motions of fluorescent probes in membranes. indeed, the anisotropic environment of the membrane
hinders the rotation of the fluorophore, the anisotropy decays
to a finite value and the depolarization is no longer described
by the perrin equation [24]. nevertheless, previous studies in
membranes [55] have shown that under certain conditions

is totally unhindered, in liquid-crystalline phases and whatever the membrane depth. thus to quantify the effect of
nsaids in the fluidity of epc liposomes by steady-state
anisotropy measurements using the unmodified perrin equation, it was necessary to choose the correct experimental
conditions. for n-as probes an excitation wavelength of 381
nm must be used [55], and the measurements were performed at 25º c, since epc vesicles are in a liquidcrystalline phase at this temperature [56].
besides the limitation to probe rotation existent in an
anisotropic media, there is also the problem of the data being
influenced by the probe itself. indeed, there is always the
possibility that observed changes in anisotropy, may be
caused not only by changes in membrane microviscosity, but
also by changes in the excited-state lifetime of the fluorophore, ' [24]. in the case of the present study, as the quenching between the fluorophore and the quencher is collisional,
the decrease in fluorescence intensity is related to that in
lifetime [24]:

then, considering in equation (9) rss as the value measured for o (the value in the absence of quencher) and the
published values of  and o for n-as probes [55], a curve is
generated with the values of the corrected anisotropy, r'.
these r' values are the variation of anisotropy that should be
obtained due to the lifetime changes of the fluorophore
(gives a correction for the influence of the probe itself in
membrane microviscosity) and are then compared with the
experimental rss values. from the difference between rss and
r' one can see the real variation of anisotropy caused by the
drug and without the illusory effect of the intrinsic variation
due to the decrease of probe fluorescence lifetime. once that
rss-r’ decreases with increasing oxicams concentration, then
it is concluded that a membrane fluidization happened for all
the nsaids studied. in fig. 4 is depicted an example of r'
and rss comparison for 12-as probe in epc unilamellar
liposomes (500 m, ph 7.4) with increasing effective concentrations of  xxxd2561xxx  and the resultant rss-r’.

the differences in the potency of the compounds studied
to increase membrane fluidity are reflected in their ic25 values, which are defined as the concentration in membrane
phase ([q]m in m) of each compound required to increase the
fluidising effect ratio [((r'-rss)/ r'0) x 100] by 25%. fig. 5
shows an example of the dependence of fluidising effect
ratio of n-as probes in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (epc)

effective concentrations, [q ]m , of  xxxd2561xxx .

the ic25 values for each  xxxd3311xxx  are given in table 3 and
the order of effectiveness of these compounds in increasing
membrane fluidity is  xxxd2508xxx >  xxxd2561xxx  >  xxxd3311xxx  >
 xxxd2969xxx  for all n-as probes.
zeta potential measurements
zeta-potential measurements were made to complete all
the information about the binding behaviour of oxicams allready gathered by the spectrophotometric and fluorescence
techniques. in fact, the interactions of charged drugs with
membranes change its surface potential and this can be related to zeta potentials. the determination of zeta potentials
of neutral liposomes in the presence of different concentrations of oxicams is represented in fig. 6.
there is no significant reduction of the zeta potential
values for  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  (the differences were
smaller than 3 mv) within the concentration range used;
where as for  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2508xxx  there is a considerable reduction of the zeta potential in a concentration dependent manner.
discussion
few studies regarding the physicochemical properties of
oxicams were reported and according to them, there are dif-

ferent ionization forms of these nsaids (cationic, neutral/zwitterionic and anionic) [57-62] although there were
some contradictory attributions of their ionization constants
[63, 64].
the considerations about physicochemical properties of
congeneric oxicams and the results obtained in the present
study provide evidence that within this nsaid family there
is interplay between the ionization forms and the respective
behaviour towards the membrane bilayers and regarding this
interplay it thus seems possible to set two subgroups inside
the  xxxd3311xxx  class.
indeed, the pyridine containing oxicams ( xxxd3311xxx  and
 xxxd2969xxx ) have two opposite charges (positive in pyridine
and negative in enol group) in close proximity and are, as a
consequence, more stable as zwitterions, even at the physiological ph studied (ph=7.4).
on the other hand,  xxxd2561xxx , which possesses no pyridine group, is ionized and the dominant specie at the ph
studied is the anionic form [61, 62]. supporting this assumption is the order of log poct values (values for partitioning of
drugs in octanol/buffer) measured for oxicams at different

ph values [61, 62], which shows for  xxxd2561xxx  a significant
decrease when the ph is increased from 2 to 7.4 due to deprotonation of enolic oh. the decrease is less marked for
 xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  due to their predominant zwitterionic population in the aqueous phase in this ph range.
as for  xxxd2561xxx , the dominant species of  xxxd2508xxx  at
the ph studied are the anionic form. actually, despite being
also a pyridine containing  xxxd3311xxx ,  xxxd2508xxx  has resulted
from the replacement of the benzo ring of  xxxd2969xxx  with a
chlorothieno ring which may change the electronic properties
of neighbouring groups to some extent due to the electronwithdrawing effects of the s-atom [62].

in conformity with these reported physicochemical differences,  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  which are more stable
zwitterions revealed a higher partition capacity in lipid bilayer and consequently higher kp values, where as  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2508xxx , being more negatively charged, had
lower partition coefficients (table 1). traditionally, the octanol-water partition coefficient has been used to measure
compound hydrophobicity, which was then correlated with
drug activity. the octanol-water system is a good membrane
model when polar group interactions between the solute and
the phospholipid bilayer are minimal or absent, but better
systems are needed for molecules which can establish electrostatic interactions with polar groups in the membrane, as

octanol can only model nonpolar interactions [65]. in accordance to this and regardless of the known existence of oxicams’ partitioning studies in octanol/buffer systems already
mentioned in the literature [61, 62], we have chosen to study
their partition in a liposomes/buffer system once that there is
a more satisfactory correlation between this parameter and
pharmacological aspects for these drugs, especially because
they have proved to be able to establish electrostatic interactions with polar groups in the biomembranes. moreover,
liposomes are generally accepted to be a suitable model for
the study of membrane structure and properties, given that
they are surrounded by a lipid bilayer structurally similar to
the lipidic matrix of the cell membranes [25, 29]. comparing
results, one can see that there is no agreement between the
partitioning of oxicams in liposomes/buffer and in octanol/buffer systems, however it must be noted that there were
also studies of oxicams’ partitioning in heptane/buffer which
also do not parallel the ones of octanol/buffer systems [62].
in addition, it has been reported that the nature of the microenvironment is capable of modulating the local vicinity of
the oxicams leading to a switch over or change between different prototropic forms and selecting a particular form of
the drugs for partition (for instance it was referred that the
anionic oxicams readily partition into the octanol phase at
ph 7.4 and not at all into the heptane phase) [58, 59, 62].
hence, the differences between the kp values obtained in this
study and the already published log poct values could be a
matter of different exposed surroundings.
the results of the quenching studies have demonstrated
that all the oxicams quench the anthroyloxy group at all
membrane depths with relative efficiencies ordered as 12as<9-as<6-as<2-as. this slightly decrease towards the
internal part of the bilayer suggests that the drugs are located
in a similar topography inside the membrane bilayers, independently if they are in a dipole or anionic forms, probably
with their hydrophilic part oriented towards the polar part of
the membrane bilayers while their hydrophobic segment is in
the upper part of the lipophilic tails. this proposed location
corroborates other published location studies for oxicams
[60]. referring to  xxxd2508xxx ’s location we can also add that
this  xxxd3311xxx  reveals a noticeable preference for the 9-as
probe suggesting that a strong additional quenching group
(chloride atom) lays near the position 9 of the phospholipids
acyl chain.

interactions between oxicams and membrane bilayers

the data obtained for oxicams’ location and partition is
also consistent with the zeta potential studies. analysing the
dependence of the concentration of drugs on zeta potential
values, fig. 6, it is evident that  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2508xxx 
provoke an appreciable decrease of the zeta potential of the
bilayer, which confirms that these compounds are negatively
charged at the ph of the studies. on the other hand,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd3311xxx  have less influence over membrane surface potential, which is in agreement with the presence of
zwitterionic forms.
the alterations in the membrane fluidity by oxicams mirror their relative quenching efficiencies (which is related to
their location within the membrane) once that a perturber
preferentially located within the lipid bilayers is more likely
to disorder the surrounding lipids, and observing the ic25
values (table 3) the order of effectiveness of these compounds in increasing membrane fluidity is  xxxd2508xxx > xxxd2561xxx > xxxd3311xxx > xxxd2969xxx .
besides analysing the differences of the nsaids in their
ability to perturb the lipid membrane as a whole, it is also
important to compare the results obtained for each probe, as
they are located in different sites of the membrane and therefore they can report on the microfluidity of those regions.
the efficacy of a perturber depends on its general effect on
bilayer fluidity and also on its effects at a specific depth of
the bilayer. it has been consistently observed for hydrophobic compounds in liquid-crystalline bilayers [28, 52, 66-68],
that the greatest perturbation in fluidity occurs in the bilayer
centre (closer to 12-as probe), and the smallest in the plateau region (the gradient is 2 < 6 < 9-as probes), suggesting
that the plateau region is more structurally stable, and less
susceptible to perturbation than the bilayer centre. the oxicams studied increase the fluidity and the observed order is
2-as < 6-as < 9-as < 12-as (table 3). this observed order
is in agreement with the studies referred above [28, 52, 6668], as 2, 6 and 9-as probes, which are part of the plateau
region, are less susceptible to perturbation than the 12-as,
located closely to the centre of the bilayer.

smaller ability to change the membrane fluidity and surface
potential. in contrast  xxxd2508xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx , which
demonstrated activity against cox-2, have revealed smaller
partition capacity in liposomes/water systems together with a
higher ability to change the membrane fluidity and surface
potential. the found correlations between interactions with
membranes; ionization forms and cox inhibition are relevant to understand the pharmacological effects of these
nsaids. nevertheless, while  xxxd2561xxx  is a recognised
cox-2 selective inhibitor,  xxxd2508xxx  produces inhibition of
cox-2 without a clear selectivity [70-73] and we found no
evidence that could support the selective behaviour of
 xxxd2561xxx , although it seems clear that this selective behaviour is not only related with the interaction of this nsaid
with biomembranes.

the studies performed in the current work proved that, in
spite of structural similarities, oxicams present different interactions with lipid membranes making possible a virtual

concluding remarks
 xxxd2561xxx  was launched as a novel nsaid of huge
therapeutic benefit in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis and other joint diseases possibly due to its reported selectivity for cox-2 [69]. the main question regarding selective cox-2 inhibitors, and why they are better tolerated has led to several proposed theories included chemical
structural relationships between  xxxd2561xxx  and other effective nsaids with low gastrointestinal toxic effects, namely
the presence of sulfa moieties, which determine the preferential binding to cox-2 [69-71]. however, other oxicams have
similar chemical groups to those that have been referred to
cause cox-2 selectivity, but despite this, are not considered
cox-2 selective drugs and exhibit less gastric tolerance.
