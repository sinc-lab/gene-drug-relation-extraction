mophore of rhodopsin, which leads to activation of the photoreceptor-specific g-protein, transducin. activated transducin
then causes activation of pde6, which results in rapid lowering
of cgmp levels, closure of cgmp-gated ion channels, and
hyperpolarization of the cell membrane (1–3). hydrolysis of
cgmp by pde6 must be precisely regulated to control the
amplitude and kinetics of the photoresponse. furthermore,
each of these parameters undergoes additional modulation in
response to ever-changing conditions of ambient illumination.
the pde6 holoenzyme consists of a catalytic dimer of ␣ and ␤
subunits (p␣␤) and two inhibitory ␥ subunits (p␥) that are
tightly bound to p␣␤. transducin activation of pde6 results
from displacement of the inhibitory constraint of p␥ upon activated transducin binding to pde6. the affinity of p␥ for the
p␣␤ catalytic dimer is also modulated in a reciprocal manner by
noncatalytic cgmp binding to pde6 at sites distinct from the
catalytic site (ref. 4 and reviewed in ref. 5).
photoreceptor pde6 is one of five members of the class i
phosphodiesterase superfamily that contain tandem regulatory
gaf domains (i.e. gafa and gafb; (6)). the gaf domains
were originally named for their presence in cgmp-regulated
pdes, certain adenylyl cyclases, and the transcription factor
fh1a of bacteria (7). the gaf domains of the vertebrate pde
members contain a functional cyclic nucleotide binding pocket.
cgmp is the ligand for pde2, pde5, pde6, and pde11 (8 –13),
whereas camp is the ligand for pde10 (13). for pde6, the
noncatalytic cgmp-binding site has been localized to the
n-terminal gafa domain (14, 15) (fig. 1a).
direct allosteric regulation of catalytic activity induced by
binding of cyclic nucleotides to the gaf domains has been well
documented for pde2 and pde5. for both pde families, cgmp
binding to the gaf domains induces a conformational change
that relieves inhibition of catalysis in the active sites, causing
stimulation of the enzyme (10, 16, 17). furthermore, the binding affinity of inhibitors to the catalytic domains of pde5 is
increased by cgmp addition (18, 19). as predicted, this allosteric regulation between the gaf and catalytic domains is
reciprocal. for example, in pde5, some inhibitors enhanced
cgmp binding to the gaf domains (11, 20). in addition to this
direct allosteric communication between gaf and catalytic
domains, it has been reported that pde5 inhibitors can induce
a conformational change in the catalytic domain that enhances
inhibitor binding affinity in a time-dependent manner (21).
based on the many similarities between pde5 and pde6 (22),
direct, inter-domain allosteric communication between the
gaf and catalytic domains is predicted for pde6. however,

photoreceptor cgmp phosphodiesterase (pde6) is the central enzyme in the visual transduction cascade. the pde6 catalytic subunit contains a catalytic domain and regulatory gaf
domains. unlike most gaf domain-containing cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, little is known about direct allosteric
communication of pde6. in this study, we demonstrate for the
first time direct, inter-domain allosteric communication
between the gaf and catalytic domains in pde6. the binding
affinity of pde6 for pharmacological inhibitors or for the c-terminal region of the inhibitory ␥ subunit (p␥), known to directly
inhibit pde6 catalysis, was increased ⬃2-fold by ligands binding
to the gaf domain. binding of the n-terminal half of p␥ to the
gaf domains suffices to induce this allosteric effect. allosteric
communication between gaf and catalytic domains is reciprocal, in that drug binding to the catalytic domain slowed cgmp
dissociation from the gaf domain. although cgmp hydrolysis was not affected by binding of p␥1– 60, p␥ lacking its last
seven amino acids decreased the michaelis constant of pde6
by 2.5-fold. p␥1– 60 binding to the gaf domain increased
vardenafil but not cgmp affinity, indicating that substrate- and
inhibitor-binding sites do not totally overlap. in addition, prolonged incubation of pde6 with vardenafil or sildenafil (but not
 xxxd2388xxx  and zaprinast) induced a distinct
conformational change in the catalytic domain without affecting the binding properties of the gaf domains. we conclude
that although p␥-mediated regulation plays the dominant role
in visual excitation, the direct, inter-domain allosteric regulation described in this study may play a feedback role in light
adaptational processes during phototransduction.

direct allosteric regulation of photoreceptor pde6

experimental procedures
materials—bovine retinas were purchased from w. l. lawson,
inc. synthetic peptide p␥63–87 was purchased from new england
peptide. vardenafil and sildenafil were provided by bayer healthcare ag. ultima gold scintillation fluid was from perkinelmer life
sciences. filtration membranes were from millipore, bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were from pierce, and all other
chemicals were from sigma. stock solutions of pde inhibitors
were prepared in dmso and diluted to less than 1% final concentration before use in assays.
pde6 and p␣␤ purification and functional assays—bovine
rod pde6 was purified from bovine retinas as described (34).
p␣␤ catalytic dimers lacking p␥ were prepared by limited trypsin proteolysis and re-purified by gel filtration chromatography
prior to use (34). pde6 catalytic activity was measured in 20 mm
tris, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  either
with a phosphate release microplate assay or with a radiotracer
assay (35). the pde6 concentration was estimated based on the
rate of cgmp hydrolysis of trypsin-activated pde6 and a
knowledge of the kcat of the enzyme (5600 mol of cgmp hydrolyzed per p␣␤ per s (36)); this estimate was validated by determining stoichiometric binding of [3h]cgmp to pde6 with a
filter binding assay (37). the inhibition potency (ic50) of
pde5/6 inhibitors or p␥63– 87 was determined in the presence
or absence of p␥ mutants using either 2 mm cgmp or 0.1 mm
camp as substrates.
purification of p␥ and p␥ mutants—several p␥ truncation
mutants (fig. 1c) were generated from the full-length coding

29700 journal of biological chemistry

sequence using standard methods, introduced into the pet11a
(novagen) expression vector, and nucleotide sequences were
verified. recombinant p␥ and mutants (p␥1– 45, p␥1– 60, and
p␥1– 80) were expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the
bacterial extract was partially purified by cation exchange chromatography using sp-sepharose, followed by c4 reverse-phase
high pressure liquid chromatography (38). the purity (⬎95%)
and size of these proteins were evaluated by sds-page. the
inhibitory activity of p␥ was assessed by its ability to stoichiometrically inhibit p␣␤ catalytic dimers (2 p␥ per p␣␤) (24).
protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic
acid protein assay (39) using bovine ␥-globulin as a standard.
loading cgmp on the gaf domains of activated pde6—purified p␣␤ was preincubated with 10 mm edta in binding
buffer (100 mm tris, 2 mm mgcl2, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin) for 2 h at 22 °c to inhibit cgmp breakdown before
addition of 1 ␮m [3h]cgmp and n-terminal region p␥ peptides
(24). the amount of cgmp bound to pde6 under these conditions was verified to be 1.7–2.0 cgmp per p␣␤. the hydrolytic
activity of pde6 was restored by adding 10 mm mgcl2 immediately prior to assaying cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis. for experiments in which [3h]cgmp dissociation kinetics from p␣␤ were
measured in the absence of p␥, purified p␣␤ was preincubated
for 2 h with 10 mm edta plus 20 mm dipicolinic acid to abolish
residual catalytic activity (40). (edta alone was unable to protect [3h]cgmp from breakdown by p␣␤ (lacking p␥ peptides)
during the binding assay.) release of [3h]cgmp from p␣␤ was
monitored following addition of 1 mm unlabeled cgmp (containing 10 mm mgcl2 and 5 mm znso4), and the time course of
[3h]cgmp dissociation was monitored in the presence or
absence of 100 ␮m vardenafil.
data analysis—dose-response experiments were analyzed
using nonlinear regression analysis (sigmaplot) to fit experimental data to a three-parameter logistic dose-response function: y ⫽ a/(1 ⫹ (x/x0)b), where a is the amplitude, b is the slope
factor, and x0 is the ic50 (41). for other experiments, curvefitting models are described in the figure legends. except where
noted, all experiments were repeated at least three times. tests
of statistical significance for the curve fitting results used the
student’s t test to calculate probability values, as indicated in
the figure legends.

results
binding of ligands to the regulatory gaf domain enhances
the ability of vardenafil to bind to the catalytic domain—motivated by the analogy of pde6 with other gaf-containing
pdes, we first explored whether ligand binding to the gaf
domains could allosterically alter the properties of the active
site of pde6.
because both cgmp and the n-terminal region of p␥ are
known to bind to the gaf domains of the pde6 catalytic dimer
(p␣␤; see introduction and fig. 1), we first examined whether
the catalytic properties of pde6 were altered upon binding of
these ligands to the gaf domains. the first 60 amino acids of
p␥ (p␥1– 60) lack the ability to inhibit catalysis (data not
shown), and the primary sites of interaction are confined to the
gaf domains (28, 42). we therefore used the truncated mutant
p␥1– 60 to determine whether the binding affinity of vardenafil

ence the catalytic properties of pde6 has not revealed a direct
parallel to the allosteric control exerted on pde5. for example,
cgmp binding to the gaf domains fails to alter either the km
or kcat of the enzyme (4, 23, 24). instead, attention has focused
on the allosteric control mediated by p␥ on both gaf and catalytic domains. the n-terminal region of p␥ (fig. 1b) is known
to interact with the gaf domains of the p␣␤ catalytic dimer
with a 50-fold higher affinity than the affinity of the c-terminal
region of p␥ for the catalytic domain of p␣␤ (24 –28). the
c-terminal region of p␥ (fig. 1b) is responsible for blocking the
catalytic activity by binding to the catalytic domains of p␣␤
(27–31). the ability of p␥ to interact with both gaf and catalytic domains of p␣␤ serves to allosterically link the regulatory
and catalytic domains of pde6 in two ways as follows: 1) p␥
binding to the catalytic dimer enhances the binding affinity of
cgmp to the gaf domain (32, 33); 2) cgmp occupancy of the
gaf domain enhances p␥ affinity to p␣␤ (4, 23, 24).
in this study, we first document that direct allosteric communication between the gaf domains and catalytic domains of
pde6 does indeed occur. ligand binding to the gaf domains
enhances the affinity of inhibitors and p␥63– 87 (i.e. amino
acids 63– 87 of the p␥ sequence) binding to the catalytic dimer.
this inter-domain allosteric mechanism is reciprocal, in that
inhibitor binding to catalytic domains increases the binding
affinity of cgmp to the gaf domains. the magnitude of this
direct allosteric regulation in pde6 is comparable with that
seen in pde5, and it may play a role in modulating pde6 activity
during persistent activation of rod photoreceptors that occurs
during normal daytime illumination conditions.

domain upon binding amino acids 61– 80 of p␥ that is distinct
from the inter-domain communication between the gaf and
catalytic domains that is induced by the gaf-interacting region
of p␥.
binding of vardenafil to the catalytic domains enhanced
cgmp binding to the gaf domains—having established in the
previous sections the direct allosteric regulation by the gaf
domains on the catalytic domain of pde6, the principle of allosteric linkage (46) requires that this allosteric communication
be reciprocal; occupancy of the active site should induce conformational changes in the gaf domains. in the earliest study
of cgmp binding to the gaf domains of pde6, the nonspecific
pde inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) was
reported to allosterically enhance cgmp binding to partially
purified, nonactivated frog pde6 (9). to examine this behavior
with our highly purified, activated bovine p␣␤ catalytic dimer,
we took special precautions to prevent [3h]cgmp breakdown
by treating p␣␤ with metal ion chelators that completely block
cgmp hydrolysis (see “experimental procedures”) prior to
evaluating the kinetics of [3h]cgmp dissociation from p␣␤.
fig. 5 shows that occupancy of the catalytic site with vardenafil
slows ⬃2-fold the release of [3h]cgmp from the gaf domains
when a large excess of unlabeled cgmp was added. similar
results were obtained when the release of [3h]cgmp from its
bound state was induced by a rapid lowering of the free
[3h]cgmp concentration using the “concentration jump”
method (47), confirming that the unlabeled cgmp added in fig.
5 was itself not influencing the outcome of the dissociation
kinetics. the ability of vardenafil to allosterically regulate
cgmp dissociation kinetics was also observed in experiments
where p␥1– 45 had been preincubated with p␣␤ and
[3h]cgmp (data not shown). these results are consistent with

the idea that binding of pde inhibitors to the catalytic domain
of the pde6 catalytic dimer can induce an allosteric change in
the cgmp binding pocket located within the gafa domain that
enhances cgmp binding affinity.
a second conformational change occurs to the catalytic
domains upon vardenafil binding—because pde5 undergoes
a slow, time-dependent conformational change in its catalytic
domain upon drug binding to the active site (21), we sought
evidence for a similar allosteric effect on pde6. fig. 6 shows
that both vardenafil and sildenafil, but not zaprinast or  xxxd2388xxx ,
increase their own affinities for the active site of p␣␤ ⬃2-fold
when incubated for 16 h compared with a 20-min drug incubation. the ability of sildenafil (fig. 6a), but not zaprinast (fig.
6b), to induce this shift in inhibitory potency cannot be
ascribed to the overall affinity of drug for the active site, because
both drugs have similar inhibition constants for rod pde6 (48),
but rather must reflect differences in how the inhibitors contact
residues within the active site.

discussion
this study represents the first demonstration that photoreceptor pde6 has the ability to undergo allosteric regulation
within its catalytic subunits. for over 2 decades it was thought
that unlike other gaf domain-containing pdes, the catalytic
properties of pde6 are not affected by direct allosteric regulation by the cgmp-binding gaf domains. however, our experiments reveal that there is a mutual allosteric reciprocity
between the gaf and catalytic domains. the binding of the
n-terminal portion of p␥ to the gaf domains alters the catalytic domain conformation, resulting in enhanced affinity of
drugs that occupy the active site as well as enhancing the affinity of the c-terminal portion of p␥ that binds to amino acid
residues in the vicinity of the active site. conversely, binding of
drugs to the active site induces a conformational change in the
gaf domains that enhances their binding affinity for cgmp.
this direct allosteric regulation occurs in addition to p␥-mediated regulation of pde6 activation, and may represent a secondary mechanism for its catalytic control.
analogies between pde5 and pde6 allosterism—direct allosteric control of catalytic activity is well documented for pde5
(see the introduction). binding of cgmp to the gaf domain of
pde5 increases cgmp hydrolysis or inhibitor binding affinity
by 2–5-fold (17–19). conversely, cgmp binding affinity to the
gaf domains of pde5 is enhanced 2-fold by inhibitors binding
to the catalytic domain (11, 49). the magnitude of inter-domain allosteric regulation reported for pde5 is thus comparable with what we describe in this study for pde6.
however, there are two major differences between the allosteric relations within pde5 and pde6. first, whereas the
cross-regulation of the catalytic and noncatalytic domains in
pde5 extends to both its natural substrates (cyclic nucleotides)
and inhibitors, this regulation in pde6 is restricted only to
inhibitors (both its regulatory p␥ subunit and chemical compounds such as sildenafil and vardenafil). it appears that in the
case of pde6, direct allosteric regulation by the gaf domain
induces a conformational change in the catalytic domain that is
sensed by inhibitors but not by substrates. the ability of p␥1–
80, but not p␥1– 60, to shift the michaelis constant for cgmp
hydrolysis (fig. 4) suggests that local conformational changes
can be induced by the c-terminal domains of p␥ that do alter
the substrate binding pocket. we will discuss the potential
structural basis for this below.
a second major difference between pde5 and pde6 is that
pde5 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation of its n-terminal region. phosphorylation of serine 102 in human pde5
induces a conformational change in the neighboring gafa
domain, resulting in a 4 –10-fold increase in binding affinity of

to test whether this slow conformational change in the catalytic domain is transmitted allosterically to the gaf domain,
we examined cgmp dissociation after preincubating pde6
with vardenafil overnight. we found that cgmp dissociation
rates were the same regardless of the length of time pde6 was
incubated with vardenafil (data not shown). we conclude that
this slowly achieved conformational change in the catalytic
domain is not communicated to the cgmp-binding site on the
gafa domain of pde6.

direct allosteric regulation of photoreceptor pde6

tacts with the h-loop (55). in contrast, vardenafil binding to the
catalytic domain of pde5 causes movement of a portion of the
h-loop toward the center of the drug-binding site, with no
major change in m-loop structure (58). we speculate that the
conformation of the pde6 h-loop is affected by vardenafil but
not  xxxd2388xxx  binding, causing an intra-domain enhancement of
drug binding affinity for vardenafil.
physiological implications of direct allosteric regulation of
pde6—it is well established that transducin activation of pde6
is the primary regulatory mechanism for the pathway of visual
excitation that leads to hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor
cell. specifically, the pde6 holoenzyme (␣␤␥␥) becomes activated when activated transducin ␣ subunit displaces the c-terminal region of p␥. a likely scenario is that the n-terminal
region of p␥ remains associated with pde6 catalytic dimer
upon transient activation of pde6 (reviewed in ref. 5). however, upon persistent illumination, pde6 may remain activated
by transducin for a sufficient time for the allosteric communication between the catalytic and gaf domains to trigger the
dissociation of the n-terminal half of p␥ (and bound cgmp)
from the gaf domains of an appreciable fraction of pde6 molecules. release of p␥ and dissociation of bound cgmp from the
pde6 catalytic subunits have been demonstrated previously to
speed up the rate at which activated transducin hydrolyzes its
bound gtp, which results in a faster rate of transducin inactivation (and hence pde6 re-inhibition (54)). in this way, allosteric communication between domains of the pde6 catalytic
dimer could influence the lifetime of activated pde6 and provide a distinct mechanism of photoreceptor light adaptation
characterized by shortened, less sensitive responses to light.
mutations of pde6 catalytic subunits are known to cause
congenital stationary night blindness or retinal degeneration
(reviewed in ref. 5). of particular interest to this study are those
instances where mutations occurring outside the catalytic
domain disrupt pde6 function and lead to visual disturbances
or retinal degeneration. one example is the mutation in gafa
(h258n) found in the rambusch form of autosomal dominant
congenital stationary night blindness (60) that alters the affinity
of p␥ for the catalytic subunits of rod pde6 (61, 62). we speculate that mutations within the gaf domains of pde6 could
also impair inter-domain allosteric communication between
the gaf and catalytic domains of pde6, possibly leading to
disruptions in the visual signaling pathway and, ultimately,
photoreceptor cell death.
conclusion—this work is the first demonstration of direct
allosteric communication within the pde6 catalytic dimer, and
it is consistent with allosteric regulation occurring with other
pde families that contain regulatory gaf domains. this interdomain allosteric communication between the gaf domains
and the catalytic domains is reciprocal, in that ligand binding to
one domain alters the properties of the other domain. unlike
other pde families, direct allosteric control of pde6 is much
less important than the g-protein-mediated regulation of
pde6 resulting from binding of the p␥ subunit to the pde6
catalytic dimer. although dis-inhibition of p␥ by transducin
dominates pde6 regulation during visual excitation, this newly
discovered inter-domain communication between the gaf
and catalytic domains may be relevant for fine-tuning the

cgmp (50, 51). this conformational change is further communicated to the catalytic domain, as judged by 2-fold elevated
cgmp hydrolytic rate (51–53). this mode of regulation has not
been documented for pde6. instead, pde6 has evolved a quite
distinct mechanism for regulating its catalytic activity. pde6
relies on a separate regulatory protein, p␥, whose binding is
regulated by activated transducin as well as by occupancy of the
pde6 gafa domains by cgmp (reviewed in refs. 5, 54).
structural basis for the conformational changes in the catalytic domain of pde6—three distinct effects on the catalytic
domain of pde6 have been observed in this study as follows: 1)
a reciprocal, ligand-mediated allosteric communication
between the cgmp-binding gaf domains and the catalytic
domain; 2) an elevation of the km value for cgmp hydrolysis
induced only by the p␥1– 80 truncation mutant; and 3) a slowly
occurring intra-domain increase in vardenafil or sildenafil
affinity that is not observed for zaprinast or  xxxd2388xxx . lacking
structural data for the pde6 catalytic domain, we wondered
whether the known pde5 catalytic domain structure (44, 45,
55) might provide insights on the structural basis for these conformational changes. to examine this, we performed structural
homology modeling by threading the pde6 catalytic domain
sequence onto the pde5 catalytic domain crystal structures
(56) containing either no ligand (57), bound vardenafil (58),
bound  xxxd2388xxx  (55), or bound 5⬘-gmp (45).
when comparing the unliganded model of the catalytic
domain to that of the vardenafil-containing structure, these two
structures are observed to have a very similar ␣-helical domain
structure overall. variability in the conformation of the
so-called m-loop and h-loop (defined in ref. 55) suggests that
these less structured loop regions are conformationally sensitive (57, 58). p␥-interacting sites are also located in the vicinity
of the m-loop (amino acids 750 –760) (43, 59). although both
the m- and h-loops are believed to provide stabilizing contacts
for drug binding, most of the residues interacting with the
cgmp substrate are found in the h-loop. this interpretation is
further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies of
pde5, which suggest that residues in the h-loop are more
important for stabilizing substrates than inhibitors (57). this
might explain why cgmp affinity to the catalytic domains is not
affected by p␥1– 60 (fig. 4), whereas vardenafil or p␥63– 87
inhibition potency is increased by p␥1– 60 (figs. 2 and 3). we
speculate that interactions of p␥ with the pde6 gaf domains
may induce conformational changes that are transmitted to the
h- and/or m-loops in the catalytic domain. in a reciprocal manner, inhibitor binding to the active site of pde6 may induce
conformational changes in the h- or m-loops that are communicated to the gaf domains to alter the conformation of the
cgmp binding pocket in the gafa domain (fig. 5). further
work is clearly needed to determine the structural basis for the
inter-domain allosterism we report for pde6 in this study.
we also showed that certain inhibitors (i.e. vardenafil and
sildenafil but not zaprinast or  xxxd2388xxx ) induce a slowly developing increase in drug binding affinity (fig. 6) that is not communicated to the gaf domains of pde6. this slow shift in drug
affinity was observed for pde5 as well (21). the structure of
 xxxd2388xxx -bound pde5 shows that  xxxd2388xxx  interacts primarily with
residues in the vicinity of the m-loop but lacks significant con-

direct allosteric regulation of photoreceptor pde6
extent and lifetime of pde6 activation, particularly during conditions of prolonged light adaptation.
