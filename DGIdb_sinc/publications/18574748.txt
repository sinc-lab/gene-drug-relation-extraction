abstract
objectives: the purpose of this study was to establish that the prostacyclin (pgi2 ) receptor ( xxxg1879xxx ) is present on rabbit and human erythrocytes and that its activation stimulates cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) synthesis and  xxxd83xxx  (atp) release.
methods: the effect of incubation of erythrocytes with the active pgi2 analogs,  xxxd2331xxx  or ut-15c,
on camp levels and atp release was determined in the absence and presence of the  xxxg1879xxx 
antagonist, cay10441. western analysis was used to determine the presence of the  xxxg1879xxx  on
isolated membranes. to establish that effects of pgi2 analogs were not due to  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2 )
receptor activation, the effect of pge2 on camp levels and atp release was determined.
results: rabbit and human erythrocytes possess ip receptors.  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c stimulated increases in camp and atp release that were prevented by the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist, cay10441. pge2
did not stimulate camp accumulation or atp release and did not inhibit  xxxd2331xxx -induced increases
in camp.
conclusions: this study establishes that the  xxxg1879xxx  is present on rabbit and human erythrocytes
and that its activation results in increases in camp and atp release. these results suggest a novel
mechanism by which pgi2 and its active analogs, when administered pharmacologically, could produce
vasodilation.

prostacyclin (pgi2 ), administered therapeutically, is
a potent vasodilator in the pulmonary and systemic
circulations. pgi2 and its active analogs have been
used successfully in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in humans [21, 28, 30, 40]. indeed, in
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah),
a human condition of unclear etiology and with high
mortality, the administration of these agents is the
most effective means of reducing pulmonary vascuthis work was supported by national institutes of health (nih)

lar resistance and prolonging survival [21, 40]. pgi2
and its active analogs bind to the pgi2 (ip) receptor,
which is coupled to gs and adenylyl cyclase [7, 14].
the mechanism by which pgi2 and its active analogs
reduce pulmonary vascular resistance has been assumed to be via activation of the  xxxg1879xxx  on vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in increases in intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)
and, ultimately, vasodilation [14].
however, it has been shown that, in addition to the
endothelial cell, another cell present in the circulation can contribute to the regulation of vascular caliber, namely, the erythrocyte. erythrocytes, via their
ability to release  xxxd83xxx  (atp), were
shown to contribute to the maintenance of low vascular resistance in isolated perfused rabbit lungs [44,
46] and to mediate vasodilation in response to exposure to reduced oxygen tension in isolated rat cerebral
arterioles [9].

receptor-mediated atp release from rbcs
rs sprague et al.

a signal transduction pathway that relates physiological and pharmacological stimuli to atp release
from rabbit and human erythrocytes has been described. components of this pathway include the heterotrimeric g proteins, gs [38], and gi [39], and
adenylyl cyclase [42, 44, 46]. importantly, increases
in camp are required for atp release from these cells
[45].
human and rabbit erythrocytes have been shown to
bind pgi2 and  xxxd124xxx  in a highly selective, saturable,
and reversible fashion that is both concentration- and
time-dependent [10, 11, 50]. although these findings
suggest that pgi2 binds to a receptor on the erythrocyte, the presence of the  xxxg1879xxx  on that cell has
not been demonstrated. the only physiological consequence of the binding of pgi2 to erythrocytes was
reported to be an increase in erythrocyte deformability [23, 24]. in the absence of demonstrable pgi2 associated activation of signaling pathways in the
erythrocyte, it was suggested that the binding of pgi2
by these cells could serve as a mechanism to decrease
the bioavailability of pgi2 permitting it to act locally while limiting systemic circulatory effects [50].
in support of this alternative interpretation, when
exposed to low nanogram concentrations of [3 h]pgi2 in plasma, erythrocytes rapidly bind nearly
80% of the available [3 h]-pgi2, accelerating its conversion to the inactive degradation product, 6-ketopgf1alpha [50]. therefore, it is possible that through the
sequestration and degradation of pharmacologically
administered pgi2 , the erythrocyte may prevent this
pgi2 from interacting with ip receptors on the vascular smooth muscle. however, if the binding of pgi2 or
its active analogs to erythrocytes results in receptormediated increases in camp, leading to atp release,
this would provide a heretofore unrecognized mechanism by which these agents could participate in the
regulation of vascular resistance when administered
pharmacologically.
here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the
 xxxg1879xxx  is a component of rabbit and human
erythrocyte membranes. in addition, we show that
the active pgi2 analogues,  xxxd2331xxx  [36] and ut15c ( xxxd3415xxx  diethanolamine, united therapeutics corp., research triangle park, nc, usa) [7],
stimulate both camp accumulation and atp release
from these cells. finally, we demonstrate that the pretreatment of rabbit and human erythrocytes with the
 xxxg1879xxx  antagonist, cay10441 [8], prevents increases in camp and atp release produced by  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c.

materials and methods
isolation of rabbit and human erythrocytes

rabbit blood was obtained from male new zealand
white rabbits (2–3 kg). animals were anesthetized
with ketamine (12.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (1.5
mg/kg) intramuscularly, followed by pentobarbital
sodium (10 mg/kg) intravenously. after tracheal
intubation, animals were ventilated with room air
(tidal volume; 10 ml/kg, rate; 25 breaths/minute).
a catheter was placed in a carotid artery for the administration of heparin (500 units) and for blood removal. ten minutes after heparin administration, the
animals were exsanguinated. human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture (anticubital vein) and collected into a 35-ml syringe
containing 50 units of heparin. the average age of
the human subjects was 37 ± 5 years (range, 23–63).
eight male and four female subjects were studied.
protocols used to obtain blood from rabbits and humans were approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee and by the institutional review
board of saint louis university, respectively.
blood was centrifuged at 500 × g at 4◦ c for
10 minutes and the plasma, buffy coat, and upper layer of erythrocytes were removed by aspiration. the remaining erythrocytes were resuspended
and washed three times in wash buffer (in mm;
4.7 kcl, 2.0 cacl2 , 140.5 nacl, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx  , 21.0
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and 5.5 glucose
with 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  [final ph 7.4]).
this procedure resulted in a concentrated preparation of erythrocytes with a hematocrit of 65–70%.
wright stains of erythrocytes prepared in this fashion reveal less than one leukocyte per 50 high-power
fields (approximately 8–10 leukocytes per mm3 ).
cells were prepared on the day of use and studied
within three hours of collection and washing.
preparation of rabbit and human erythrocyte
membranes

all procedures were performed at 4◦ c. washed erythrocytes (2 ml) were added to 200 ml of hypotonic
buffer (in mm; 5 tris-hcl and 2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [edta] with the ph adjusted to 7.4)
and stirred vigorously for 20 minutes. the mixture was centrifuged at 23,300 × g for 15 minutes.
the supernatant was discarded and the membranes
were resuspended in hypotonic buffer, centrifuged at
23,300 × g for 15 minutes, and the supernatant

rs sprague et al.

again discarded. this procedure was repeated a
third time and the washed membranes were pooled.
the protein concentration of membrane preparations was determined with the bca protein assay
(pierce, rockford, il, usa). aliquots were stored at
−80◦ c.
preparation of rabbit and human platelet
membranes

all procedures were performed at 4◦ c. platelet-rich
plasma (prp) was obtained by the centrifugation of
whole blood at 400 × g for 10 minutes. the prp was
collected and, after the addition of 500 units of heparin and edta (1 mg/ml), was centrifuged again
(200 × g for 40 minutes). the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1400 × g for 20 minutes.
the resulting platelet pellet was lysed in 200 µl of
buffer (in mm; 300.0 nacl, 10.0 edta, 1.5 mgcl2 ,
20 beta-glycerophosphate, 0.1 sodium vanadate, 25.0
hepes, and 1 ml triton x-100 [final ph 7.4]) and
centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 minutes. the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined
with the bca protein assay. aliquots were stored at
−80◦ c.
measurement of camp

for the determination of camp, erythrocytes were diluted with wash buffer (described above) to achieve
a hematocrit of 50%. after incubation with pharmacological agents, 1 ml of the erythrocyte suspension
was added to 4 ml of ice-cold  xxxd102xxx  containing hcl (1 mm) and the mixture was centrifuged
at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4◦ c. the supernatant was removed and stored overnight at −20◦ c
to precipitate remaining proteins. samples were centrifuged a second time at 3,700 × g for 10 minutes
at 4◦ c. the supernatant was retained and dried under vacuum centrifugation. concentrations of camp
were determined by using an enzyme immunoassay
(ge healthcare, piscataway, nj, usa). cell counts
were obtained from the suspension of washed erythrocytes and amounts of camp measured were normalized to 1010 cells/ml.
measurement of atp and hemoglobin

atp was measured by the luciferin-luciferase technique [11, 12, 14–19], which utilizes the atp
concentration dependence of light generated by the
reaction of atp with firefly lantern extract. sensitivity was augmented by the addition of synthetic
d-luciferin to the crude firefly lantern extract. a

463

200-µl sample of erythrocyte suspension (0.04%
hematocrit) was injected into a cuvette containing
100 µl of crude firefly lantern extract (10 mg/ml
distilled water, fle 250; sigma, st. louis, mo, usa)
and 100 µl of a solution of synthetic d-luciferin
(50 mg/100 ml distilled water; sigma). the light
emitted was detected by using a luminometer (turner
designs, sunnyvale, ca, usa). a standard curve was
obtained on the day of each experiment. to exclude
the presence of significant hemolysis, samples were
centrifuged at 500 × g at 4◦ c for 10 minutes and the
presence of free hemoglobin in the supernatant was
determined by light absorption at a wavelength of
405 nm. all data were excluded from experiments in
which free hemoglobin was detected. cell counts were
obtained from the suspension of washed erythrocytes
and amounts of atp measured were normalized to
4 × 108 cells/ml.
concentration-response relationship for pgi2
analog-induced increases in camp in rabbit
and human erythrocytes

washed erythrocytes of rabbits or humans (50%
hematocrit) were incubated with either  xxxd2331xxx  (rabbit and human erythrocytes; cayman chemical
company) or ut-15c (rabbit erythrocytes; united
therapeutics corp., research triangle park, nj,
usa) at concentrations of 10 nm to 1 µm. amounts
of camp were determined at baseline and 15 minutes
after the addition of the prostacyclin analogs or their
vehicle (saline).
western analysis of erythrocyte and platelet
membranes

erythrocyte membranes (50 or 100 µg of protein
for rabbits and humans, respectively) or platelet
membranes (0.1 or 0.03 µg of protein for rabbits
and humans, respectively) were solubilized in sample buffer (0.277 m sodium  xxxd3215xxx  [sds],
60% glycerol, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 0.25 m tris-hcl,
and 0.004% bromophenol blue), heated (five minutes, 100◦ c) and loaded onto a precast 4–12% gradient or 7.5% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(page) gel (cambrex, allendale, nj, usa) and subjected to electrophoresis in buffer containing 25 mm
tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% w/v sds (ph 8.3) at
4◦ c. after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membrane
in transfer buffer (25 mm tris and 192 mm glycine
with 20% v/v methanol at a ph of 8.3) at 4◦ c.
pvdf membranes were then incubated with an antibody directed against the human  xxxg1879xxx  (rabbit

polyclonal, 1:800 dilution; cayman chemical company, ann arbor, mi, usa). on separate gels, the
same membrane preparations were incubated with
antibody directed against human  xxxg1202xxx  (mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000 dilution; chemicon, temecula, ca,
usa). platelet membranes were included on the latter gels as a positive control. after incubation with
the primary antibodies, membranes were incubated
with appropriate secondary antibodies and exposed
to enhanced chemiluminescence using ecl (pierce,
rockford, il, usa).
determination of camp levels of erythrocytes in
response to incubation with  xxxg1879xxx  agonists,
 xxxd2401xxx  or pge2, in the absence and presence
of receptor antagonists

washed rabbit erythrocytes (50% hematocrit) were
incubated with either  xxxd2331xxx  (1 µm), ut-15c
(1 µm),  xxxd2401xxx  (iso, 1 µm; sigma) or pge2
(1 µm; sigma). the agonists were administered
in the presence and absence of a 30-minute pretreatment with either an  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist
(cay10441, 10 µm; cayman chemical company)
or a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol
(10 µm; sigma). in separate studies, washed human erythrocytes were incubated with  xxxd2331xxx  in the
absence and presence of cay10441. in all studies,
camp concentration was determined 15 minutes after the addition of the agonist.
determination of atp release from erythrocytes
in response to incubation with  xxxg1879xxx  agonists
in the absence and presence of cay10441

washed rabbit erythrocytes (20% hematocrit) were
incubated with either ut-15c (1 µm) in the absence
or presence of the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist (cay10441,
10 µm). in separate studies, human erythrocytes
were incubated with  xxxd2331xxx  (1 µm) in the absence or
presence of cay10441 (10 µm). the atp concentration in the cell suspension was determined 30 minutes
after the addition of cay10441 and at 5, 10, and 15
minutes after the addition of  xxxd2331xxx  and at 1, 5, and
10 minutes after the addition of ut-15c. these time
periods were chosen based on preliminary studies.
the response to each agonist is reported as the maximal response observed. the maximum increase in
atp release in response to  xxxd2331xxx  occurred at 11 ± 2
and 10 ± 1 minutes in rabbit and human erythrocyte
preparations, respectively. the maximum response to
ut-15c occurred at 5 ± 1 minutes in rabbit erythrocyte preparations. in addition to stimulated atp release, total atp content of erythrocytes in all groups

was determined by the lysis of a known number of
erythrocytes.
statistical methods

statistical significance was determined with an analysis of variance (anova). if the f ratio indicated
that changes occurred, a fischer’s lsd protected ttest was used to identify individual differences. a
p-value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant. results are reported as the means ±
standard error.
results
effect of prostacyclin analogs on camp levels
in rabbit and human erythrocytes

incubation of rabbit erythrocytes with either  xxxd2331xxx 
(n = 4) or ut-15c (n = 4) resulted in concentrationdependent increases in camp (figure 1a). human
erythrocytes also displayed concentration-dependent
increases in camp when incubated with  xxxd2331xxx 
(figure 1b), although the maximum response was
greater.
identification of the  xxxg1879xxx  as a component
of rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes

to establish that ip receptors are present on rabbit
and human erythrocytes, isolated membranes were
resolved by western analysis and probed with an antibody generated against amino acids 1–16 of the
n-terminal portion of the human  xxxg1879xxx . this
antibody identified a band with the predicted molecular mass of the  xxxg1879xxx  in membranes of rabbits and humans (figures 2a and 2b). the gels are
representative of studies with 7 rabbit and 14 human erythrocyte membrane preparations. in order
to ensure that the erythrocyte membrane preparations were not contaminated with platelets, formed
elements of the blood that also express the  xxxg1879xxx 
[27], separate studies were performed in which the
same membrane preparations were probed with an
antibody directed against  xxxg1202xxx , a protein expressed
in platelets [27]. as shown in figure 3, there was
no significant platelet contamination of human erythrocyte membrane preparations, as indicated by the
inability to detect  xxxg1202xxx . two commercially available antibodies to  xxxg1202xxx  did not bind to the rabbit
 xxxg1202xxx . however, manual platelet counts performed on whole rabbit blood revealed platelet counts
in excess of 300,000/mm3 while no platelets were detected in the washed erythrocyte preparations. these

findings indicate that platelet contamination does not
account for the detection of the  xxxg1879xxx  in erythrocyte membrane preparations from either species.
effect of an  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist on pgi2
analog-induced increases in camp in rabbit
and human erythrocytes

incubation of washed rabbit erythrocytes with  xxxd2331xxx  (1 µm, n = 9) resulted in a 171 ± 32%
increase in camp content (figure 4a). pretreatment
of rabbit erythrocytes with the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist, cay10441 (10 µm, n = 5), had no effect
on basal camp levels but prevented the iloprostinduced increase in camp (figure 4a). the vehicle
for cay10441 (n ,n-dimethylformamide, dmf) had
no effect on camp levels in erythrocytes (n = 6). to
demonstrate that cay10441 did not inhibit the ability of erythrocytes to synthesize camp, rabbit erythrocytes were incubated with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist,  xxxd2401xxx  (1 µm), in the absence and
presence of cay10441, and camp levels were determined.  xxxd2401xxx  (n = 9) stimulated a 93 ± 29%
increase in camp that was not inhibited by pretreatment with cay10441 (n = 4) (figure 4b).
importantly, the pretreatment of rabbit erythrocytes
with the beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol (10 µm,
n = 5), inhibited  xxxd2401xxx -induced increases
in camp but did not alter the response to  xxxd2331xxx 
(n = 4) (figures 4a and 4b). in separate studies,
incubation of rabbit erythrocytes with a second ip
receptor agonist, ut-15c (1 µm, n = 9), resulted
in an increase in camp of 189 ± 38% that was prevented by pretreatment with cay10441 (figure 5a).
to establish that the ability of an ip agonist to increase camp levels was not limited to the erythrocytes of rabbits, human erythrocytes were incubated
with  xxxd2331xxx  (1 µm, n = 5) in the absence and presence of cay10441. as shown in figure 5b,  xxxd2331xxx 
produced a 168 ± 72% increase in camp that was
prevented by pretreatment with cay10441.
it has been reported that  xxxd2331xxx  [25] and ut-15c
[1], in addition to the activation of ip receptors, can
interact with members of another group of eicosanoid
receptors, members of the ep receptor family. to establish that the increases in camp associated with
incubation of erythrocytes with these pgi2 analogs
were not related to ep receptor activation, in separate studies, rabbit erythrocytes were incubated with
the preferred agonist for ep receptors, pge2 (1 µm,
n = 4) or its vehicle, dmf. pge2 did not produce
increases in camp nor did pretreatment with pge2
alter the response to  xxxd2331xxx  (figure 6).

332 ± 72% increase in atp release that was prevented in the presence of the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist
(figure 7b). to ensure that decreased atp release
did not reflect a depletion of intracellular atp by
cay10441, levels of total intracellular atp in the absence and presence of the inhibitor were determined.
as shown in table 1, total intracellular atp levels
in rabbit and human erythrocytes were not affected

the erythrocyte, by virtue of the hemoglobin that
it contains, has long been recognized as a vehicle
for oxygen transport. in addition to this well established function, it has been shown that this cell can
participate in the local regulation of vascular resistance via its ability to release atp [3, 5, 9, 12, 13,
44]. atp released from erythrocytes can interact with
purinergic receptors on the vascular endothelium [4,
15, 18], resulting in the synthesis and release of vasodilators, including  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and metabolites of  xxxd208xxx  [5, 15, 44, 46]. a signal

techniques used to isolate erythrocyte membranes in
those studies likely damaged the enzyme, dramatically decreasing its ability to synthesize camp [35].
more recently, it was shown that rabbit and human
erythrocytes possess ac activity [35, 41, 45] and,
using western analysis, the presence of type ii ac
in rabbit and human erythrocytes was established
[42, 47]. support for a functional role for camp in
erythrocyte physiology was demonstrated in studies
in which  xxxd1742xxx , a nonselective activator of ac as
well as the active camp analog, sp-camp, stimulated atp release from rabbit and human erythrocytes [45]. in addition, it was shown that human
erythrocytes possess beta-adrenergic receptors and that
incubation of these cells with the beta-agonist  xxxd2401xxx  resulted in increases in intracellular camp
[35, 41, 42].

the heterotrimeric g proteins, gs [38] and gi [39],
adenylyl cyclase (ac) [40, 43, 45], protein kinase
a (pka) [45], as well as the  xxxg437xxx  [43]. importantly,
increases in camp are required for atp release from
human and rabbit erythrocytes [45].
although older reports had suggested that human
erythrocytes were nearly devoid of ac activity, the

in addition to beta-agonists, pgi2 and  xxxd124xxx  also bind
to human erythrocytes in a highly selective, saturable, and reversible fashion [10, 11, 50]. however,
in spite of the fact that this binding was shown to
be concentration- and time-dependent, the only reported physiologic consequence of pgi2 binding was
an increase in erythrocyte deformability [23, 24].
thus, although previous studies demonstrated that
pgi2 and  xxxd124xxx  interact with erythrocytes in a manner consistent with receptor binding, in the absence
of evidence demonstrating activation of intracellular
signaling pathways, it was suggested that this binding
represented a mechanism for the in vivo inactivation
and metabolism of pgi2 [50].
here, we report that incubation of erythrocytes of
rabbits and humans with active pgi2 analogs,  xxxd2331xxx  or ut-15c, results in concentration-dependent
increases in camp (figure 1) and atp release (figure 7), results that are consistent with the activation of a  xxxg1879xxx . we next determined if these
effects of  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c were, in fact, mediated via the activation of ip receptors on rabbit
and human erythrocytes. using western analysis, we
determined that the  xxxg1879xxx  is present in membranes of erythrocytes of both species (figure 2). using an antibody to human  xxxg1202xxx , a protein found
on platelets but not on erythrocytes [27], we were
unable to detect any platelet contamination of human erythrocyte membrane preparations (figure 3).
in addition, no platelets were detected by the manual counting of washed rabbit erythrocyte preparations from which membranes were isolated. these
results support the hypothesis that concentrationdependent increases in camp, as well as atp release produced by  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c, are the

receptor-mediated atp release from rbcs
rs sprague et al.

consequence of activation of ip receptors on rabbit
and human erythrocytes.
the mature erythrocyte lacks a nucleus and protein
synthetic machinery preventing the use of techniques
to alter  xxxg1879xxx  expression in these cells. however,
a selective antagonist of the  xxxg1879xxx , cay10441,
has been developed [8]. pretreatment of erythrocytes
of rabbits (figure 4a) and humans (figure 5a) with
cay10441 prevented  xxxd2331xxx -induced increases in
camp. in addition, in rabbit erythrocytes, cay10441
prevented increases in camp produced by a second
chemically dissimilar  xxxg1879xxx  agonist, ut-15c
(figure 5b). to ensure that cay10441 did not interfere directly with the ability of erythrocytes to synthesize camp, rabbit erythrocytes were treated with
 xxxd2401xxx  in the absence and presence of the ip
receptor antagonist. cay10441 had no effect on either basal camp levels (figure 4a) or isoproterenolinduced increases in camp (figure 4b). the effect
of  xxxd2401xxx , but not that of  xxxd2331xxx , was prevented by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (figures 4a and 4b).
thus, both cay10441 and propranolol demonstrate
selectivity and efficacy for their individual receptors.
finally, incubation of human erythrocytes with  xxxd2331xxx  (figure 5a) or rabbit erythrocytes with ut15c (figure 5b) produced increases in camp that
were prevented by cay10441 pretreatment. importantly, cay10441 pretreatment also prevented increases in atp release produced by the incubation of
rabbit and human erythrocytes with the active pgi2
analogs (figure 7). taken together, these results provide strong support for the hypothesis that  xxxd2331xxx 
and ut-15c produce increases in camp and atp
release from rabbit and human erythrocytes via the
activation of the  xxxg1879xxx .
it was reported that both  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c, in addition to binding to the  xxxg1879xxx , can interact with
other eicosanoid receptors that are members of the ep
family [36]. four subtypes of the ep receptor have
been identified. the preferred agonist for all members of this receptor family is pge2 , an eicosanoid
that does not activate the  xxxg1879xxx  [36]. it has been
suggested that erythrocytes possess ep receptors,
based on reports that pge2 stimulates activity of
the calcium-dependent  xxxg1232xxx  (gardos
channel) in these cells [20, 29]. to determine if the effects of  xxxd2331xxx  or ut-15c were a consequence of interaction with ep receptors, we examined the ability
of pge2 to stimulate camp accumulation and atp
release from erythrocytes. incubation with pge2 did
not produce increases in camp in rabbit erythrocytes

469

nor did pretreatment with pge2 diminish iloprostinduced increases in camp (figure 6). in addition,
pge2 did not stimulate atp release from rabbit or
human erythrocytes (data not shown). thus, it is
highly unlikely that  xxxd2331xxx - and ut-15c-induced
increases in camp levels or atp release from erythrocytes are mediated by the activation of ep receptors.
the intravenous administration of either pgi2 or its
active analogs,  xxxd2331xxx  and  xxxd3415xxx , are effective
treatments of pulmonary hypertension in humans
[21, 28, 30, 40]. long-term continuous infusion of
pgi2 (epoprostenol) is associated with decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased survival in
humans with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah) [21, 40]. it is well documented that
pgi2 and its active analogs produce vasodilation of
isolated blood vessels via binding to ip receptors on
the vascular smooth muscle, resulting in increases
in camp [14]. however, when infused into humans
or added to washed erythrocytes, the vast majority
of pgi2 is bound by erythrocytes [10, 11, 50]. the
finding that  xxxd2331xxx  and ut-15c stimulate camp
accumulation and atp release from rabbit and human erythrocytes suggests a heretofore unrecognized
mechanism by which the intravenous administration
of pgi2 could reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.
atp has been shown to produce vasodilation in isolated lungs via the stimulation of no synthesis [44].
when pgi2 or its active analogs are infused into the
pulmonary circulation, their binding to ip receptors
on erythrocytes would result in increases in camp
and the release of atp from that cell. atp released
from erythrocytes can then interact with endothelial
purinergic receptors, resulting in the release of no.
in support of this hypothesis, it was reported that
humans with ipah demonstrate decreased levels of
no in exhaled air when compared to healthy human control subjects [21, 40]. however, in the ipah
patients receiving intravenous pgi2 , exhaled no levels were greater than in ipah patients not receiving pgi2 or healthy control subjects [40]. although
other interpretations are possible, these findings are
consistent with the hypothesis described here, that
is, that intravenous infusion of pgi2 in ipah patients results in the stimulation of atp release from
erythrocytes, leading to increases in pulmonary endothelial no synthesis. in light of the evidence supporting extensive binding and rapid degradation of
pgi2 in plasma containing washed human erythrocytes, it could be argued that pgi2 -induced release
of atp from erythrocytes, with the subsequent atpinduced activation of endothelial no synthesis, may

470

receptor-mediated atp release from rbcs

actually represent a more important mechanism by
which exogenously administered pgi2 opposes pulmonary hypertension than via a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle.
conclusions

in summary, we have shown that the  xxxg1879xxx  is a component of the membranes of erythrocytes of humans and rabbits, and that incubation
of these cells with  xxxd2331xxx  or ut-15c, two active
pgi2 analogs, stimulates receptor-mediated camp
accumulation and atp release. these results suggest a novel mechanism by which pgi2 and its active analogs, when administered pharmacologically
to intact animals, can produce vasodilation. moreover, these findings suggest that the erythrocyte is a
potential target for the design of new therapies for
the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
