properties of  xxxd2638xxx   xxxd2638xxx  is a novel calcium channel antagonist with structural and pharmacological characteristics clearly distinct from those of classical calcium antagonists. it is a potent vasodilator with a high selectivity for
the coronary vasculature over the peripheral vasculature and
the myocardium. most importantly, this compound can relax
vascular muscle and slow the heart rate without reducing
cardiac contractility. in addition, it does not stimulate neurohormonal reflexes and it exhibits a good pharmacological
profile characterized by a long duration of action.
mechanism of action the mechanism of action of  xxxd2638xxx 
is characterized by the selective blockade of transient, lowvoltage-activated (t-type) calcium channels over long-lasting, high-voltage-activated (l-type) calcium channels, which
is probably responsible for many of its unique properties.

why develop another calcium antagonist?
calcium antagonists are widely used in the treatment of arterial hypertension [1] and coronary artery disease [2,3], in particular angina pectoris and coronary spasm. classical compounds belong to three main chemical classes [4]: dihydropyridines (amlodipine, nifedipine), phenylalkylamines (verapamil) and benzothiazepines (diltiazem). efficacy differs
among all three classes of drugs and tends to be limited by
unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic features, such as low bioavailability, a short half-life and a high first-pass effect, leading to
variability in plasma concentrations. specific side effects are
observed for each class of calcium antagonists. dihydropyridines, which are potent peripheral vasodilators, stimulate reflex tachycardia and are often associated with leg edema, headache and flushing. non-dihydropyridines tend to produce
negative inotropy and should not be used in patients with
compromised myocardium [5,6]. in a multicenter study,
diltiazem has been found to increase the mortality of patients
who have previously suffered a myocardial infarction or who
show clinical signs of heart failure [7]. these problems have
motivated a search for calcium antagonists with a different
mode of action and without these side effects.

clinical use of  xxxd2638xxx  although calcium antagonists
are mainly used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, there is strong preclinic al evidence that
 xxxd2638xxx  may also be beneficial in the treatment of congestive heart failure.

optimal pharmacokinetic profile (high bioavailability, intermediate half-life). to this end, a series of pharmacological
tests was set up at f. hoffmann–la roche, in which over 500
compounds were screened (table 1). this program led to the
discovery of  xxxd2638xxx  in 1986.
 xxxd2638xxx  is a novel calcium channel blocker that does not
belong to any of the three previously known chemical classes
of these antihypertensive drugs [8]. it differs in chemical structure, pharmacological properties and mechanism of action, as
reflected in a new atc classification number.  xxxd2638xxx  is a
tetralol derivative; its structure is 1s,2s-2-{2-[(3-benzimidazol-2-yl-propyl)-methyl-amino]-ethyl}-6-fluoro-1-isopropyl1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-yl ester hydrochloride (1:2),
which occurs as a single enantiomer (fig. 1). it has a molecular weight of 568.56 and is chemically stable and light-insensitive. values for the negative log of the acid-ionization constant (pka) are 4.8 for the benzimidazolyl group and 5.5 for
the tertiary amine.

main pharmacological properties
peripheral and coronary vasodilation

in contrast to verapamil and diltiazem,  xxxd2638xxx  is selective
for the vasculature and is much more potent at relaxing vascular smooth muscle than cardiac or striated muscle. in this
respect, it is comparable to the dihydropyridines (such as
nifedipine and  xxxd2737xxx ) [8,9]. the affinity of  xxxd2638xxx 
for vascular smooth muscle depends on the nature of the
muscle and its effects are more pronounced in the coronary
artery than in the ileum (isolated guinea pig model [8]) or the
saphenous vein (dog model [10]). this selectivity for the
coronary arteries may explain the low incidence of constipation and side effects related to the relaxation of peripheral
smooth muscles [11].
 xxxd2638xxx  increases coronary flow in a variety of models including guinea pigs [8], ischemic and non-ischemic dogs
[12,13] and rats [14]. in the langendorff rat heart,  xxxd2638xxx 
causes a concentration-dependent increase in coronary blood

flow of up to 84% [15]. a potent dilating effect has also been
reported in conscious dogs, with  xxxd2638xxx  increasing the
coronary blood flow by 103% and the coronary artery diameter by 7.8% [16]. in addition,  xxxd2638xxx  protects the epicardial coronary arteries from  xxxd2021xxx -induced vasoconstriction [16], a test used for the prediction of spastic coronary
artery disease in humans [17]. the dilating effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on large coronary arteries is partly endothelium-independent (~30%), a result of importance considering that most
patients treated with calcium antagonists also exhibit endothelial dysfunction, which limits coronary vessel dilation through
a flow-dependent mechanism. as observed with classical calcium channel blockers,  xxxd2638xxx  also interferes with endothelium-dependent responses and reduces endotheliumdependent contractions evoked by various stimuli in dog
arteries [18].  xxxd2638xxx  also evokes endothelium-dependent
relaxation by increasing the release of endothelium-derived
relaxing factors (probably  xxxd2738xxx ) in the dog, the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the salt-sensitive dahl rat [19].

companied by a slight decrease in the heart rate. there is no
sign of decreased cardiac contractility as there is no reduction
in cardiac output or in the time derivative of left ventricular
pressure (dp/dtmax). in the same models, verapamil, diltiazem
and, to a lesser extent, amlodipine exhibit negative inotropy
for equipotent doses.
these results have been confirmed in humans:  xxxd2638xxx 
acts as a potent vasodilator and reduces the heart rate without decreasing cardiac contractility. this profile has been observed in normal volunteers [25], hypertensive patients [22],
and patients with angina pectoris [26,27] or heart failure [28].
doses as high as 200 mg (twice the maximum recommended
therapeutic dose) are not associated with negative inotropic
effects and do not decrease the left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with angina pectoris. in contrast, other calcium antagonists, such as verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine and
 xxxd2718xxx , all exhibit a dose-dependent negative inotropic
effect [7,29–32].

heart rate decrease

although  xxxd2638xxx  is similar to the dihydropyridines in its
strong vasodilating effects, it does not release baroreceptor
reflexes and consequently does not induce tachycardia. in
the conscious rat,  xxxd2638xxx  moderately decreases the heart
rate and it is comparable in that respect to diltiazem and verapamil, whereas amlodipine, for a similar pressure drop, significantly increases heart rate [20].
in humans,  xxxd2638xxx  also decreases the heart rate in a dosedependent fashion at both peak and trough (fig. 2); a fall of
6–10 beats/min is observed with a dose of 100 mg in
hypertensive patients [21,22]. the magnitude of this heart
rate reduction is directly related to the baseline heart rate:
the lower the heart rate at baseline, the smaller the decrease
upon treatment [21].

no negative inotropic effects

despite its potent vasodilator properties,  xxxd2638xxx  does not
induce negative inotropy, except at very high concentrations
(10 times higher than the concentration producing maximal
coronary vasodilation). this observation has been made in
isolated hearts of guinea pigs, rats and rabbits [8,15,23] and is
also reported from the hearts of anesthetized dogs [12] and
conscious rats [15,20,24] with and without experimental heart
failure. in anesthetized dogs and conscious rats, the main effect of  xxxd2638xxx  is coronary and peripheral vasodilation ac-

treatment of hypertension with calcium antagonists, in particular the dihydropyridines, stimulates the sympathetic and
renin–angiotensin systems [33,34]. the ensuing increased levels of plasma catecholamines, renin and aldosterone oppose
the antihypertensive action. with  xxxd2638xxx , such adverse
neurohormonal stimulation is absent or very small. in a dog
heart failure model,  xxxd2638xxx  did not stimulate the catecholamine system to the extent observed with diltiazem [35] and,
in contrast to dihydropyridines, it did not significantly affect
the renin–angiotensin system in renal [36] nor in deoxycorticosterone acetate (doca)-salt [37] hypertensive rats. moreover,  xxxd2638xxx  has been reported to inhibit the in vitro secretion of hormones such as aldosterone [38,39].
an absence of neurohormonal stimulation upon treatment
with  xxxd2638xxx  is also observed in humans and changes in
plasma renin, catecholamine and aldosterone levels are not
significant [22]. in contrast, during long-term treatment with
dihydropyridines, the level of plasma catecholamines remains
elevated [34].

pharmacokinetic profile

oral  xxxd2638xxx  has a high bioavailability (≥70% at therapeutic doses) and an intermediate elimination half-life (17–25 h)
with a single daily dose. the plasma concentration peaks in
1–2 h and steady-state is reached within 3–4 days.  xxxd2638xxx 
is metabolized into numerous byproducts [40] which are eliminated predominantly by the liver. saturation of the metabolic enzymes of the liver could explain the non-linear pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2638xxx  in the dog [41] and in humans
[42], which is reflected in an increasing bioavailability with
an increasing dose and/or duration of treatment. except for
amlodipine, most calcium antagonists have a much shorter
duration of action [43–45].

mechanism of action
selective blockade of low-voltage-activated (t-type)
ca2+ channels

 xxxd2638xxx  blocks the transient t-type ca2+ channels selectively over the long-lasting, high-voltage-activated (l-type)
ca2+ channels, unlike classical calcium antagonists, which preferentially block l-type ca2+ channels. fig. 3 shows the contrast between the dihydropyridine amlodipine and the new
t-type antagonist  xxxd2638xxx . a 10- to 30-fold selectivity for
t-type over l-type ca2+ channels has been reported in vascular (fig. 3c) [46] as well as cardiac (fig. 3b) [47,48] muscle
cells. selective blockade has also been observed in aldosterone-secreting adrenal glomerulosa cells (m. rossier, personal communication, 1996). in rat hippocampal ca3 dissociated
neurons,  xxxd2638xxx  is also selective for t-type ca2+ channels
(f. knoflach, personal communication, 1997), but since it does
not cross the blood–brain barrier,  xxxd2638xxx  is not considered for neurological applications.  xxxd2638xxx  also blocks expressed high-voltage-activated central nervous system ca2+
channels (n-, q- and r-type) but the drug concentrations
necessary for 50% blockade are at least 10-fold higher than
those acting on vascular t-type ca2+ channels [49]. thus,  xxxd2638xxx  can be used to differentiate t-type from high-voltageactivated ca2+ channels of types l, n, q, and r.
the specific distribution of t-type ca2+ channels in the body
[50] along with the selectivity of  xxxd2638xxx  for this channel
type may explain some of the unique pharmacological features of the drug. in the heart, t-type ca 2+ channels are present in coronary smooth muscle cells and in sinus node pace-

maker cells, whereas they are seldom observed in healthy
ventricular myocytes. since sinus node cells control the heart
rate and ventricular myocytes are responsible for cardiac contractility, selective blockade of t-type ca2+ channels may dilate coronary arteries and decrease the heart rate without cardiodepression. the relationship between t-type ca2+ channel
blockade and a heart rate decrease is supported by the fact
that the pacemaker cycle length is reduced by nickel in cat
atrial myocytes [51] and by nickel [52] or ryanodine [53] in
rabbit sinoatrial node cells.
it is becoming increasingly clear that t-type ca2+ channels
are important to the regulation of many neurohormonal secretory systems (reviewed in [50]), including aldosterone secretion [54,55]. blockade of endocrine t-type ca2+ channels
by  xxxd2638xxx  might explain the reduced neurohormonal
stimulation observed with this drug. however, blockade of
hormone-induced ca2+ influx via receptor-operated channels
has also been proposed as an alternative mode of action [56].
binding site on the l-type ca2+ channel

because the t-type ca2+ channel has not yet been cloned,
there is no information on  xxxd2638xxx ’s binding site on that
channel. in contrast, recent evidence indicates that  xxxd2638xxx 
binds to a site on the l-type ca2+ channel that is different
from those identified so far for the five main classes of ca2+
antagonists: 1,4-dihydropyridines, benzothiazepines, phenylalkylamines, diphenylbutylpiperidines ( xxxd2142xxx ) and indolizinesulfones (fantofarone) [57]. binding studies in cardiac membrane preparations have shown that  xxxd2638xxx  does

 xxxd2638xxx , a t-type ca2+ channel blocker clozel et al. s21

not interact with the dihydropyridine site and that it inhibits
the binding of diltiazem, desmethoxyverapamil and fantofarone with median inhibitory (ic 50) values of 8.2, 13 and
55 nmol/l, respectively [8,58]. furthermore, mutations in three
amino acids in the transmembrane ivs6 segment of the ltype ca 2+ channel affect the binding of dihydropyridines and
phenylalkylamines without modifying the affinity for  xxxd2638xxx  [59], further supporting the existence of a binding site
for  xxxd2638xxx  that is separate from those described for classical calcium channel blockers.

tent anti-ischemic activity, characterized by an improvement
in coronary blood flow and contractile function in the ischemic
region without an alteration in ventricular performance. thus,
 xxxd2638xxx  appears to inhibit calcium entry into ischemic
myocytes without affecting cardiac contractility or conduction. this property may be explained by the potent blockade
of calcium entry exerted by  xxxd2638xxx  in depolarized cells.
because ischemic myocardial tissue is depolarized [72],  xxxd2638xxx  may be selective for ischemic tissue while remaining
minimally cardiodepressant.

voltage dependence of ca2+ channel blockade

in clinical studies involving patients with chronic stable angina pectoris,  xxxd2638xxx  has proved to be an effective antianginal and anti-ischemic drug [26,73]. the improvement in
ischemic contractile function is the result of decreased arterial pressure and heart rate, which are the main determinants
of myocardial oxygen demand, and improved coronary flow,
which defines myocardial oxygen supply.

voltage-dependent and use-dependent blockade by  xxxd2638xxx  has been observed for l-type and t-type ca2+ channels
in freshly dissociated guinea pig atrial myocytes [47,60,61]
and cultured neonatal or adult rat ventricular myocytes [48],
and also for l-, n-, q- and r-type ca 2+ channels expressed as
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx – xxxg831xxx /delta–beta 2b complexes in xenopus oocytes [49]. this suggests
that  xxxd2638xxx  binds preferentially to an activated state of
the channel (though binding to the resting state of the ttype ca2+ channels has also been reported in human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells [62] and l-type ca2+ channels in
rat vascular muscle cells [63]). in guinea-pig heart myocytes,
blockade of l-type ca2+ channels is strongly voltage-dependent, being 50-fold more potent when the cells are held at
–50 mv than when they are held at –80 mv [61].
because  xxxd2638xxx  is more potent at less negative potentials,
it has a limited effect on myocardial cells (membrane potential approximately –80 mv) compared to smooth muscle cells
(membrane potential approximately –50 mv). this could further explain its favorable pharmacological profile, as a combination of potent vasodilating action and absence of negative
inotropic effect.

antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effects
the antihypertensive properties of  xxxd2638xxx , which are
derived from its potent vasodilating effect, have been demonstrated in three rat models of hypertension, including genetic hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive rats), renal
hypertension (stimulated renin–angiotensin system in twokidney, one-clip hypertensive rats) and doca-salt hypertension (suppressed renin–angiotensin system in salt-fed rats)
[14,64]. in all three models,  xxxd2638xxx  is about three to five
times more potent than verapamil and its duration of action
is longer [14]. in the renal hypertensive model,  xxxd2638xxx 
treatment is as effective in lowering systolic blood pressure
as angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) therapy (enalapril),
a result not achieved with conventional calcium channel antagonists [65]. clinical studies [21,22] have confirmed the efficacy of  xxxd2638xxx  as an antihypertensive drug of comparable or improved potency in comparison to nifedipine [11],
verapamil and diltiazem [66]. the antihypertensive effect is
dose-dependent and is more marked in hypertensive patients
(up to 15 mmhg) than in normotensive patients [25,26].
in several experimental models mimicking stable [12,67], unstable [68–70] and variant [71] angina,  xxxd2638xxx  exhibits po-

antiproliferative effects
hypertension is associated with cardiac remodeling, which is
characterized by hypertrophy, a decrease in coronary vascular
reserve and myocardial fibrosis.  xxxd2638xxx  alleviates these
symptoms in various models of hypertension by effectively
lowering blood pressure [37,74,75], but also by preventing
the anomalous infiltration/growth of damaged tissues associated with the development of arteriosclerosis.
in the doca-salt hypertensive rat treated with  xxxd2638xxx ,
resorption of hypertrophy and fibrosis appeared related to a
direct action on cardiomyocyte and fibroblast growth [37]. in
addition,  xxxd2638xxx  prevented the infiltration of monocytes
in the subendothelium of the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats [76]. finally, in a rat model of vascular injury,  xxxd2638xxx  produced a 54% decrease in the area of neointima
formed 14 days after injury [77]. although the ace inhibitor
 xxxd1694xxx  also potently decreases neointima formation in this
model, its mechanism of action is different [78]. ace inhibition seems to work mainly by inhibiting the early migration
of smooth muscle cells from the media to the neointima [79],
whereas  xxxd2638xxx  most likely inhibits proliferation of the
cells. the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by
 xxxd2638xxx  has been confirmed by measures of in vitro thymidine incorporation (fig. 4). in contrast to  xxxd1694xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx , calcium antagonists that act primarily on the l-type
channel, such as verapamil [77], amlodipine [77] and  xxxd2092xxx  [80], do not prevent neointima formation at doses
producing a similar blood pressure decrease. thus, the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd2638xxx  may be derived from its specific blockade of t-type ca2+ channels. this result is further
supported by a recent review on the role of t-type ca 2+ channels in proliferation and growth [50].

renal protection
renal failure is a complication of hypertension that is not systematically alleviated by antihypertensive therapy because it
is not exclusively dependent on arterial blood pressure. cal-

cium antagonists can reduce renal injury but this effect is more
dependent on the inhibition of renal growth than on alterations in glomerular perfusion [81]. consequently, the effect
of calcium antagonists on progressive renal injury is controversial: beneficial effects (nifedipine [82], verapamil [83]), detrimental effects (verapamil [83],  xxxd2737xxx  [84]) and no effect (amlodipine [81]) have been reported.
we tested the effects of  xxxd2638xxx  in doca-salt hypertensive rats [64]. this model is characterized by the rapid appearance of renal failure associated with proteinuria. in this
model  xxxd2638xxx , in contrast to amlodipine, was able to decrease proteinuria and prevent glomerular lesions. these are
the first positive results reported with a calcium antagonist in
such a model. they suggest that  xxxd2638xxx  may dilate afferent and efferent arteries in different proportions from those
associated with classical calcium antagonists. the difference
might reflect a different density of t-type ca 2+ channels in
the two vessels.

effect in heart failure
the use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of chronic
myocardial infarction has been limited by their negative inotropic effects; this is a serious drawback, particularly when
myocardial function is already depressed by the evolving myocardial infarct. the results of multicenter studies indicate that
in patients with chronic heart failure, diltiazem increases the

occurrence of cardiac events [7], whereas verapamil does not
differ from placebo [85].  xxxd2092xxx  [86] and amlodipine do
not reduce the mortality rate in patients with severe heart
failure although the latter improves it in a subgroup with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [87]. currently, a 125-center
international clinical program, the mortality assessment in
congestive heart failure (mach 1) trial, is evaluating the
ability of  xxxd2638xxx  to affect survival and the symptoms of
heart failure; results are expected in 1998.
in experimental models of heart failure [15,23,24,35],  xxxd2638xxx  does not exert negative inotropic effects, even in animals with compromised cardiac function, in contrast to verapamil and diltiazem. in a recent study comparing the effects
of  xxxd2638xxx , nifedipine and verapamil on cardiac contractility in human papillary muscle strips from failing hearts, a very
small cardiodepressant effect was found for  xxxd2638xxx , even
at supratherapeutic doses (fig. 5) [88]. furthermore, in a rat
model of chronic heart failure,  xxxd2638xxx  improved survival
to the same extent as the ace inhibitor  xxxd1694xxx  (fig. 6),
without impairing left ventricular function but with a marked
reduction in left ventricular weight and fibrosis [89]. it has
been proposed that the blockade of t-type ca2+ channels contributes to the pharmacological profile of  xxxd2638xxx , and in
particular to the low occurrence of negative inotropism. in
addition, because t-type channels are upregulated in the
hypertrophied heart [90–92] and could mediate the response
to hypertrophic signals [93,94], blockade of these channels
might provide an additional benefit in chronic heart failure.

conclusion
 xxxd2638xxx  belongs to a new class of calcium antagonists with
structural and pharmacological characteristics that differ from
those of previously used compounds.  xxxd2638xxx  is a potent
peripheral and coronary vasodilator, which stabilizes sinoatrial nodal activity and reduces ischemic afterload without negative inotropy. its unique mechanism of action involves a
selective blockade of t-type over l-type ca2+ channels. although the physiological and pathological functions of t-type
ca2+ channels are not fully understood, it is becoming increasingly clear that they are important in pacemaker activity, hormone secretion and growth regulation. consequently, t-type
ca 2+ channel blockade may underlie several aspects of the
favorable pharmacological profile of  xxxd2638xxx .
