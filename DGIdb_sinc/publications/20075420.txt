objective—we measured efflux from macrophages to  xxxg175xxx -depleted serum from 263 specimens and found
instances in which serum having similar high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) differed in their efflux capacity.
thus, we wanted to elucidate why efflux capacity could be independent of total hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg173xxx ).
methods and results—to understand why sera with similar hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx  could differ in total efflux capacity, we
assessed their ability to promote efflux via the pathways expressed in camp-treated j774 macrophages. briefly,
macrophages were preincubated with  xxxd3014xxx  to block  xxxg9xxx , with blt-1 to block  xxxg2013xxx , and with both inhibitors
to measure residual efflux.  xxxg21xxx  efflux was measured with transfected bhk-1 cells. we used apolipoprotein
b-depleted serum from specimens with similar hdl-c values at the 25th and 75th percentiles. specimens in each group
were classified as having high or low efflux based on total efflux being above or below the group average. we found
that independently of hdl-c, sera with higher efflux capacity had a significant increase in  xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux,
which was significantly correlated to the concentration of pre␤-1 hdl. the same result was obtained when these sera
were similarly analyzed based on similar  xxxg173xxx .
conclusion—sera with similar hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx  differ in their ability to promote macrophage efflux because of
differences in the concentration of pre␤-1 hdl. (arterioscler thromb vasc biol. 2010;30:796-801.)

pidemiological and interventional studies1– 4 demonstrate
an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (hdl-c) levels and coronary heart disease, which
is an observation also supported by animal studies.5 thus,
high hdl-c levels are thought to independently reduce
coronary heart disease risk. although hdl has been shown to
have both antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties,6 its
beneficial antiatherogenic effect is likely attributable to its
central role in reverse cholesterol transport, ie, the transport
of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion
to reduce its accumulation in tissue cells such as vessel wall
macrophages.7 because both hdl metabolism and cholesterol transport are complex processes, it has been difficult to
obtain in vivo evidence that modulating hdl levels can affect
removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells in the vessel
wall and reduce atherosclerotic lesions. overexpression of apolipoprotein (apo) a-i in mice can reduce progression of atherosclerotic lesions,8 and infusion of  xxxg173xxx /phospholipid complexes in humans promotes lesion regression and increases fecal
excretion of bile acids.9 however, results of studies in subjects

with monogenic disorders of hdl metabolism10,11 and post hoc
analyses of epidemiological studies raise questions regarding the
mechanism underlying the association between hdl-c levels
and coronary heart disease.12
we recently demonstrated that in healthy individuals having a wide range of hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx  levels, the capacity of
serum hdl to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages
in vitro is negatively correlated with measures of carotid
intima thickness independently of hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx  levels,
suggesting that measures of hdl function may be additional
predictors of cardiovascular risk.13 hdl exists as a heterogeneous population of particles differing in size and composition.6 in addition, efflux of cellular cholesterol is mediated
by a number of pathways, including aqueous diffusion,
 xxxg9xxx ,  xxxg21xxx , and  xxxg2013xxx , with different hdl particles
best-suited to promote efflux via each of these pathways.14
thus, the efficiency of an individual serum to accept cellular
cholesterol depends on the distribution of hdl particles and
the cholesterol transporters expressed in the cell being used as
a cholesterol donor. because hdl subfractions differ in their

ability to remove cholesterol from macrophages, the fact that
individuals with similar hdl-c may have different distribution of hdl particles provides a rationale for the increased
predictive value of measures of hdl function we observed.
in this study, we took advantage of the efflux data
previously generated and identified subjects having similar
hdl-c but significantly different total macrophage efflux.
we assumed that differences in total efflux resulted from
differences in the levels of functional hdl particles. we then
used a published inhibitor-based assay15 to measure the
relative contribution of different pathways to the total efflux
capacity of a given serum as an indication of the relative
concentration of hdl particles present. our results show that
subjects with similar hdl-c but higher total macrophage
efflux capacity have significantly higher  xxxg9xxx -mediated
efflux, and this efflux is associated with the level of pre␤-1
hdl in serum. the same results were obtained with a subset
of the same sera chosen to have similar  xxxg173xxx .

subjects and methods
as previously described,13 efflux was measured using serum aliquots
specifically collected for this purpose obtained from wellcharacterized subjects participating in a prospective, observational
study to investigate the effect of hdl-c on markers of oxidative
stress and inflammation and their relationship to subclinical atherosclerosis. by design, the subjects enrolled were healthy nonsmokers
with no clinically evident coronary heart disease, a broad range of
hdl-c levels, and no use of drugs known to significantly affect
hdl levels. the study was approved by the university of pennsylvania institutional review board and all subjects gave their informed
consent for participation. approximately equal numbers of males and
females were recruited, but the experiments reported here were performed with serum from female donors because more serum aliquots
were available. these were selected to have similar hdl-c by choosing
sera with hdl-c within a 6% range (hdl-c ⫾6%), which is ⬍7%
biological variation for hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx .16 in addition, to confirm our
results, a few critical experiments were repeated using serum from male
donors also chosen to have similar hdl-c.

serum lipid parameters
blood was taken after a 12-hour fast, and several plasma and serum
aliquots were prepared and frozen (⫺70°c) for future studies. edta
plasma aliquots were used for lipid and lipoprotein analyses performed
in a centers for disease control-standardized lipid laboratory as
previously described.17 the distribution of  xxxg173xxx  containing hdl
particles in apob-depleted serum was measured using immunoblotting
and image analysis after separation of the various particles with
nondenaturing, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described.18 to
obtain particle mass, the percent distribution of hdl particles was
applied to the total  xxxg173xxx  concentration. levels of pre␤-1 hdl were
also assayed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (pre␤-1
hdl elisa; daiichi). we obtained a significant correlation between
2-dimensional gel and enzyme-linked immunoassay pre␤-1 hdl values
for all available values (r2⫽0.357; p⫽0.0069; n⫽19).

assay of cellular cholesterol efflux
j774 cells, maintained in rpmi plus 10% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics in 5% co2, were plated in 24 multi-well plates (70 000
cells/well) and labeled for 24 hours in the presence of acat
inhibitor (2 ␮g/ml cp113 818; a gift from pfizer) using 0.5 ml/well
of 2 ␮ci/ml [1,2-3h] cholesterol (perkin elmer) in rpmi plus 1%
fetal bovine serum. to upregulate  xxxg9xxx  in j774 cells, we incubated
an additional 16 hours with 0.5 ml/well medium containing 0.3 mmol/l
cpt-camp (sigma) and 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in rpmi. the
relative contribution of various efflux pathways was measured by
2-hour pretreatment of replicate wells of camp-treated j774 cells

with rpmi-0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  alone or this medium plus
20 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx , 1 ␮mol/l blt-1, or both to specifically inhibit
 xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg2013xxx .15 the contribution of  xxxg21xxx  to total efflux
capacity was directly measured by 4-hour incubation of abcg1transfected bhk 1 cells with the same specimens used with j774
cells. in bhk-1 cells transfected with  xxxg21xxx , receptor expression
is regulated by mifepristone; the difference between cells treated
overnight with mifepristone (10 nmol/l) and untreated cells represents  xxxg21xxx  efflux.19 sera for these studies were aliquots stored at
⫺70°c, used after a single thaw, and chosen to have similar hdl-c
(hdl-c ⫾6%) at either the 25th (low hdl⫽45; n⫽22) or 75th (high
hdl⫽73; n⫽18) percentile of the hdl-c distribution. efflux was
the fraction of total cellular cholesterol released in 4 hours to
apob-depleted serum, obtained after removal of apob lipoproteins
with  xxxd2982xxx  (mw 8000; sigma),18 and diluted to 2.8%
(equivalent to 2% serum) in mem-hepes (0.5 ml/well). we have
routinely used this dilution to promote release of radioactive cholesterol to the medium in 4 hours, which is well above background.
supplementary figure i (available online at http://atvb.ahajournal.
org) shows the dependence of the various receptor-mediated efflux
pathways expressed in j774 cells in the dose of apob-depleted
serum. in this figure,  xxxg9xxx  efflux is the difference between
camp-treated and control j774 cells and  xxxg2013xxx  is the efflux
measured from fu5ah cells, in which  xxxg2013xxx  is the major efflux
pathway and  xxxg21xxx  efflux is the difference between mifepristone
treated and untreated transfected bhk-1 cells.  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg21xxx 
efflux show linear dose-dependence; the dose-dependence for
 xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux fits a nonlinear regression that tends to
plateau but a concentration of 2.8% apob-depleted serum is below
this point (graphpad prism 5; graphpad software). to further
validate our macrophage model, we measured  xxxg9xxx  efflux using
bhk-1 cells transfected with  xxxg9xxx , in which receptor expression is
regulated with mifepristone, and found that the dose-dependence of
 xxxg9xxx  efflux measured with bhk-1 cells was identical to that
measured with j774 cells (supplementary figure i). in every experiment, we monitored upregulation of  xxxg9xxx  in j774 cells as increased
efflux to  xxxg173xxx  (20 ␮g/ml) from cells treated with camp compared to
untreated cells (11⫾4-fold stimulation; n⫽10 experiments) and used an
aliquot of a standard serum pool at 2% to monitor interassay variability
in total efflux from camp j774 cells and  xxxg21xxx  efflux from bhk-1
cells. transfected bhk-1 cells were a kind gift from dr jack oram
(university of washington, seattle, wash). all cellular incubations
were performed at 37°c, and expression of cholesterol transporters was
confirmed by western blot in initial experiments. sera from subjects
with similar high or low hdl-c were defined as having low or high
efflux capacity based on total j774 efflux below or above the average
efflux for each group. the same analysis was performed using a subset
of these specimens chosen to have similar  xxxg173xxx  at either the 25th (low
 xxxg173xxx  127 mg/dl; n⫽11) or 75th (high  xxxg173xxx ⫽163 mg/dl; n⫽10)
percentile of the  xxxg173xxx  distribution.

statistical analysis
results are reported as mean⫾sem. linear regression was used to
establish associations between parameters. differences between
means were established with unpaired 2-tailed t test. these analyses
were performed using graphpad prism 5 (graphpad software) and
statistical significance was assumed for pⱕ0.05.

figure 1. contribution of efflux pathways to total cholesterol
efflux. efflux from control and camp-treated j774 macrophages
was measured after 2 hours of pretreatment with inhibitors to
block specific cholesterol transporters. all cells were incubated
for 4 hours with apob-depleted serum isolated from aliquots of
a human serum pool at 2.8% (equivalent to 2% serum). all procedures performed as in methods. results are the average of 3
independent experiments.

also slightly increased in the residual efflux measured in cells
treated with both  xxxd3014xxx  and blt-1. the major contribution to
this efflux is aqueous diffusion, which represents ⬇50% of the
total efflux in control j774 cells; however, after camp treatment
this residual efflux may also include other inhibitor-resistant
pathways such as  xxxg21xxx , which can be detected by western
blot (data not shown). figure 1 also shows a low level of
 xxxg9xxx  efflux in control j774 cells. in agreement with favari
et al,20 this efflux is  xxxd3014xxx -sensitive as confirmed by ⬎90%
decrease in efflux to 20 ␮g/ml  xxxg173xxx  from both control and
camp-treated j774 cells (supplementary figure ii, available
online at http://atvb.ahajournal.org). because we cannot specifically measure  xxxg21xxx  efflux in camp j774 cells, we used
transfected bhk-1 cells. in this model,  xxxg21xxx  expression is
regulated by mifepristone and, as previously shown,19,21 mifepristone significantly stimulated cholesterol efflux to both hdl3
and apob-depleted serum (data not shown).
although we previously measured the efflux capacity of
apob-depleted serum from specimens obtained from a population of healthy male and female subjects,13 in the current
study the majority of the experiments were performed using
serum from the females. there were no differences between
the demographic characteristics of the entire population of
female subjects (n⫽130) and those of subjects with similar
low (n⫽22) or similar high (n⫽18) hdl-c whose serum was
chosen for this study (supplementary table i, available
online at http://atvb.ahajournal.org).
as expected, efflux was significantly associated with the
serum hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx  levels (supplementary figure iiia,
b, available online at http://atvb.ahajournal.org; n⫽130).
however, these graphs suggest that the apob-depleted serum
isolated from individuals having the same or similar hdl-c
or  xxxg173xxx  can promote significantly different efflux from
j774 macrophages. this is better shown by the representative
examples in figures 2 (hdl-c) and 3 ( xxxg173xxx ).
to investigate why serum with similar hdl-c showed
high and low efflux efficiency, we measured the relative
contributions of different pathways to total efflux in 2 groups
of specimens with hdl-c ⫾6%: a low hdl group (n⫽22)
with average hdl-c of 48 mg/dl (range, 45–51 mg/dl) and
a high hdl group (n⫽18) with average hdl-c of 73 mg/dl

figure 2. efflux from camp-treated j774 cells to serum pairs with
similar hdl-c. total cholesterol efflux from camp-treated j774
macrophages was measured after 4-hour incubation with 2.8%
apob-depleted serum as in methods. there were significant differences in efflux (p⬍0.05) between all pairs with the same or similar
hdl-c as determined by unpaired, 2-tailed t tests.

(range, 69 –77 mg/dl). we used the apob-depleted serum
from each group to measure cholesterol efflux from camptreated j774 with no pretreatment or pretreated 2 hours with
 xxxd3014xxx  to block  xxxg9xxx , with blt-1 to block  xxxg2013xxx , and
with both inhibitors to measure the residual efflux. in parallel
assays, each apob-depleted serum was used to assess  xxxg21xxx 
directly by measuring efflux from transfected bhk-1 cells
untreated and treated with mifepristone to induce receptor
expression. we defined low and high efflux capacity based on
total j774 efflux below or above the average of all sera with
similar hdl-c and asked if these specimens differed in their
ability to promote efflux via individual pathways.
the results of this analysis are shown in tables 1 (low hdl-c
sera) and 2 (high hdl-c sera). as can be seen, the most
dramatic difference we found was that specimens with high
efflux capacity had significantly increased ability to promote
efflux via  xxxg9xxx . we also found a significant but less pronounced increase in the ability of high efflux capacity serum to
promote residual or inhibitor-resistant efflux. there were no
significant differences in either  xxxg2013xxx –mediated efflux from
j774 cells or in  xxxg21xxx -mediated efflux from bhk-1 cells. sera
with similar  xxxg173xxx  (figure 3) can also have significantly
different macrophage efflux. thus, we selected a subset of the
same specimens based on similar  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg173xxx  ⫾6%) and
analyzed the efflux values we had obtained. two groups were

with similar low levels of  xxxg173xxx  (127 mg/dl) and total
macrophage efflux above the average for the group had higher
 xxxg9xxx  efflux when compared to sera with total efflux below
the mean for the group (9.98⫾0.320% per 4 hours, n⫽5 vs
7.72⫾0.533% per 4 hours, n⫽6; p⫽0.0073). likewise, sera
with high efflux capacity and similar high  xxxg173xxx  levels (163

there were no significant differences in the efflux mediated by
any other pathway. thus, independently of hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx 
level, the increased efficiency of a given apob-depleted serum to
remove cholesterol from macrophages is attributable to the fact
that it can more efficiently promote cholesterol efflux via
 xxxg9xxx .
because the differences in efflux shown in tables 1 and 2
were not related to serum hdl-c, we used 2-dimensional gel
electrophoresis to measure pre␤-1 hdl levels.18 figure 4
shows that there is a significant correlation between  xxxg9xxx 
efflux and the level of pre␤-1 hdl in all the specimens
analyzed using 2-dimensional gels (n⫽29). the r2 value
(r2⫽0.425) obtained suggests that 43% of the variability in
 xxxg9xxx  efflux can be explained by the level of pre␤-1 hdl
in these sera. there were also significant associations between  xxxg9xxx  efflux and the pre␤-1 hdl levels in sera
having similar low or high hdl-c (low hdl-c: r2⫽0.220,

although we did not have pre␤-1 hdl values for all the sera
chosen on the basis of similar  xxxg173xxx , the  xxxg9xxx  efflux
mediated by all the specimens in this smaller subset was also
significantly associated with the serum pre␤-1 hdl levels
measured (r2⫽0.357, p⫽0.040, n⫽12).
although we had focused these studies on the apob-depleted
serum from female donors, confirmatory experiments were
performed with apob-depleted serum from healthy males who
participated in the same clinical study and have a similar
demographic profile (data not shown). we found that whether
the specimens from male donors had similar low hdl-c
(hdl-c⫽38 mg/dl ⫾6%; n⫽14) or similar high hdl-c
(hdl-c⫽63 mg/dl ⫾6%; n⫽16), sera with higher capacity to
promote efflux from j774 macrophages had significantly higher
 xxxg9xxx  efflux (supplementary tables ii and iii).
to better-link high efflux capacity to increased  xxxg9xxx  and
pre␤-1 hdl, we calculated the average pre␤-1 hdl concentration for all sera with high vs low efflux capacity. as expected,
high efflux sera had higher pre␤-1 hdl. however, the average
values were not significantly different (high⫽25⫹3.5 mg/dl,
n⫽15 vs low⫽19⫹2.6 mg/dl, n⫽14), possibly because of the
low number of sera in each group. to increase the statistical
power of this analysis, we obtained a commercially available
enzyme-linked immunoassay to establish pre␤-1 hdl in all the
specimens from female and male donors for whom we had
 xxxg9xxx  efflux (figure 5; n⫽63). increasing the number of data
points allowed us to establish a significant difference in the
pre␤-1 hdl values measured in specimens with high vs low
 xxxg9xxx  efflux (high⫽27⫾1.ng/ml, n⫽33 vs low⫽22⫾1.7

 xxxg9xxx  but not  xxxg2013xxx –mediated efflux from j774 macrophages.27 thus, there is increasing evidence that measures of
hdl subfractions, especially pre␤-1 hdl, and measures of
hdl function, such as in vitro assay of cholesterol efflux,
may be useful adjuncts to the traditional assays of serum
hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx  when evaluating cardiovascular risk.
the experiment results we now report agree with the concept
that measures of hdl parameters in serum do not always reflect
hdl function. we measured cholesterol efflux to the apobdepleted serum, isolated from human specimens by removing
apob lipoproteins,18 and used camp-treated j774 macrophages
as cholesterol donors. although aqueous diffusion and  xxxg9xxx 
are the major pathways contributing to efflux in these cells, other
efflux receptors are expressed and likely functional. as expected, we found significant associations between efflux and
both the serum hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx  levels when we considered
efflux results obtained with all specimens from female donors
(supplementary figure iiia, b; n⫽130). these associations
validate our assay and, in agreement with figure 1, suggest that
efflux from the j774 macrophages is mediated by numerous
pathways interacting with both lipid-rich and lipid-poor hdl
particles. however, many individuals with the same serum
hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx  have different capacities to promote cellular
cholesterol efflux. this is clearly seen in figures 2 and 3, in
which we show representative pairs of individual specimens
with the same or similar hdl-c (figure 2) or  xxxg173xxx  (figure 3)
but significantly different efflux efficiencies. results in tables 1

and 2 and figure 4 indicate why neither measures of hdl-c nor
measures of  xxxg173xxx  predict the capacity of individual sera to
promote efflux from macrophages. thus, when we used a
published method15 to establish the relative contribution of
various efflux pathways with serum samples having either
similar low hdl-c (table 1) or high hdl-c (table 2), serum
having a higher capacity to promote efflux of cholesterol from
j774 macrophages could more efficiently promote efflux via
 xxxg9xxx , which in turn was significantly associated with the
concentration of pre␤-1 hdl (figure 4). figure 5 shows that
when we measured pre␤-1 hdl in all sera for which we had
 xxxg9xxx  efflux (n⫽63), higher levels of pre␤-1 hdl resulted in
higher  xxxg9xxx  efflux.
because total macrophage efflux may also be independent
of  xxxg173xxx  levels (figure 3), we analyzed a subset of the same
specimens based on similar high or low  xxxg173xxx . as for
hdl-c, regardless of  xxxg173xxx  levels, specimens with higher
efflux showed a higher capacity to promote efflux via
 xxxg9xxx , and this efflux was associated with the levels of
serum pre␤-1 hdl.
it is thought that the activity of  xxxg1782xxx ,
hepatic triglyceride lipase, and  xxxg432xxx 
can increase serum pre␤-1 hdl levels, whereas  xxxg1305xxx  activity has the opposite effect.24,26,28 our
database includes only  xxxg432xxx  mass,
and the level of  xxxg432xxx  in sera we
identified as having higher  xxxg9xxx  efflux and pre␤-1 hdl was
not different than that in low efflux sera. this could be either
because the number of sera in each group is too small or because
measures of  xxxg432xxx  activity would be a
better indicator.
it has been reported that modifications of hdl particles affect
their functionality by either changing their specificity toward
receptors29,30 or their ability to promote efflux. thus, francis
et al31,32 have shown that oxidative tyrosylation of hdl promotes formation of ai–aii heterodimers that can enhance
efflux. in contrast, oxidation of  xxxg173xxx  by myeloperoxidase can
significantly impair  xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux.33 because we
used serum specimens from a healthy normolipidemic population, we believe it is unlikely that our results were significantly
affected by the presence of abnormal hdl.
the experiments reported in this article were performed
with apob-depleted serum from female donors; however,
comparable results were obtained in a small study using
apob-depleted serum from healthy male donors who participated in the same clinical study and have a similar demographic profile. thus, for specimens with similar low or high
hdl-c, a higher capacity to promote efflux from j774
macrophages was attributable to significantly higher  xxxg9xxx 
efflux (supplementary tables ii and iii).

conclusion
in summary, our experiments show for the first time to our
knowledge that the apob-depleted serum from individuals
with similar levels of hdl-c or  xxxg173xxx  may have different
capacities to remove cholesterol from macrophages. in our
cell model, specimens from subjects with either similar
hdl-c or similar apo a-i that have higher efflux capacity
can better-promote efflux via  xxxg9xxx , and this is related, in

large part, to the serum concentration of pre␤-1 hdl. these
novel results add to the increasing evidence that measures of
hdl function, such as its efflux capacity, can be useful when
assessing an individual’s coronary heart disease risk.
