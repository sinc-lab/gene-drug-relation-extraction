roids form a superfamily of transcription factors (9, 10).however, the majority of the members of this superfamily are nuclear orphan receptors (11). all attempts to identify natural
physiological ligands for these orphan receptors have failedso
far with one exception;  xxxd3417xxx  (12, 13) has been shown to be
the natural ligand of fer (14). recently we cloned a cdna
encoding the orphan nuclear receptorrzrp from rat brain (15).
this receptor is preferentially expressed in brain and shares
sequence similarity with retinoid receptors, but
binds to its
response elements as a monomer (15). rzrp shows constitutive
transactivational activity that, however, can be enhanced by
unidentified components of fetal calf serum (fcs).
in this report we show that  xxxd2559xxx  binds and activates
rzrp with kd and ec,, values in t h e low nanomolar range.we
propose that rzrp represents one of the described nuclear
binding sites of  xxxd2559xxx  and is involved in the nuclear signaling of this hormone.

were hybridizedwith a digoxigenin-labeledrzrp crna probe as described (29). z, cross-section through the retina: strongest signal was detected
in the inner nuclear layer (inl), which contains the cell bodies of amacrine and bipolar cells. a less intense signal was also found over the
photoreceptors of the outer nuclear layer ( o m )and the retinal ganglion cells (gcl).

hybridization signal was foundin the cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn)above the optic chiasm (och).zii, coronal sectionthrough the

and pineal gland (pi):

layer (sug)of the superior colliculus and layer iv (n)
of the overlaying occipital cortex also showed a strong signal.

incubated at 30 "c for 180 min. hela cells were transfected with the
expression vector forrat rzrp or the parental vector psg5.40 h after
transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared as described (17).
2-[1~iliodomelatonin(diluted to 22 ci/mmol, dupont nen) in the presence or absence of 500 p~ non-labeled 2- xxxd2377xxx  as competitor
was incubated for 2-3 h at room temperature either with 10 pl of in
vitro translated rat rzrp (using unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate as
control for nonspecific
binding) or with 10 pl of nuclear extract from rat
rzrp-transfected hela cells(using psg5-transfected cells as control)
in binding buffer (25 m~ tris acetate, ph 7.8, 100 m~  xxxd2987xxx , 10 m~ magnesium acetate, 1m~ dithiothreitol) in a total volume
of 100 pl. the same volume of cold 5% charcoal, 0.5% dextran t40 in
binding buffer was then added, and the incubation was continued for
30 min onice. the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation for
15 min at 4 "c, and radioactivity was measured directly in a y-counter
(pharmacia).

results and discussion
using patty (16) we quantified rzrp mrna in various
dissectionsof the central nervous systemas well as in tissues of
peripheral organs (fig.1a).in the central nervous systemwe

found rzrp mrna most prominently in the pineal gland,
thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas in the periphery only
the adrenal gland was positive.for a more exact localization
of
rzrp mrna, we performed in situ hybridization in tissue sections of rat brain and eye (fig. 1b). we found rzrp mrna in
the neural retina as well as in retinorecipient structures like
the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the superficial gray layer of
the superior colliculus. in addition, signal was detectedin certain thalamic nuclei and in several regions of the cerebral cortex. in the retina, cells of the inner nuclear layer contained the
highest levels of rzrp m r n a , lower levels were observedin
the cells of the ganglion celllayer and theouter nuclear layer.
overall, the distribution of rzrp mrna resembles the distribution of binding sites for  xxxd2559xxx  (18-20). in particular,
suprachithe finding that rzrp is expressed in the retina, the
asmatic nucleus (a pacemaker of the internal clock), and the
pineal gland suggeststhat this receptor is associated with aspects of  xxxd2559xxx  action.this led us to hypothesize that  xxxd2559xxx  may be a physiological ligand form p .

fig.2. ligand-inducedfunctional activity of rzrp in  xxxg1420xxx  cells. drosophila  xxxg1420xxx  cells were transfected with the expression vector for
rzrp (or, for control of endogenous activity, with the parental expression vector
psg5) and thecat reporter construct containing
a n rzr response
element and treated with increasing concentrations
of  xxxd2559xxx  andfcs as indicated. thecells were harvested 16 after
h onset of the stimulation,
and cat assays were performedas described (30). the cat activities were normalized to p-galactosidase
activity. columns represent mean values
of at least three independent experiments; the bars indicate standard deviations.

to assay rzrpmediated gene activity, we transfected drosophila  xxxg1420xxx  cells (21, 22) with a n expression vector for rzrp
and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) reporter plasmid containing anoptimized response element for rzrp monomers (15) fused to the heterologous thymidine kinase ( t k ) promoter. in the presence or absence of fcs, we then stimulated
with graded concentrations of  xxxd2559xxx  (fig. 2). in the absence of fcs, we obtained a typical dose-response curve providing a n ec,, value for rzrp-dependent transactivation of
about 3 m. we observed a 5-fold increase of basal constitutive
activity of rzrp in thepresence of fcs. this activation could
be suppressed whenfcs was depleted either nonspecifically of
small lipophilic compounds by double treatment with charcoal
or specifically of  xxxd2559xxx  by immunoprecipitation with an
anti- xxxd2559xxx  antibody and protein a-sepharose. interestingly, the dose responseto melatoninof rzrp-dependent transactivation in the presence of fcs that had been specifically
depleted of  xxxd2559xxx  provided an ec,, value of less than1 nm.

showed no transcriptional activation by  xxxd2559xxx  (data not
shown).
to analyze the specificity of rzrp-dependent transactiva1.2
tion, we tested structural analogues of  xxxd2559xxx  as well as
some neurotransmitters for their ability to activate cat gene
expression in rzrp-overexpressing human hela cells (table
i). of these compounds only  xxxd2559xxx  and 2- xxxd2377xxx 
showed significant modulation of rzrp-mediated gene activity.
incontrasttotheindirect
activation of orphan receptor
coup-tf by dopamine describedpreviously (26,27), thephosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid had no effect on rzrp activity.
dose responses to  xxxd2559xxx  and 2- xxxd2377xxx  (fig. 3) revealed for both compounds ec,, values for rzrp-dependent
transactivation of about 3 nm. for comparison,the kd and ec,,
values for binding and activation of rxr by  xxxd3417xxx  were
determined as 11.7 and 18 nm, respectively (12, 13).
we next asked whether rzrp binds  xxxd2559xxx  directly. we
obtained specific binding of 2-[’251] xxxd2377xxx  to in vitro
translated rzrp (fig. 4a);scatchard plot analysis yielded a kd
value of 70 nm (fig. 4b). in contrast, when hela cells have
been transfected with rzrp, nuclear extracts from these cells

value of 5 m (fig. 40). in competition studies we could not
detect any significant differences between  xxxd2559xxx  and 2iodomelatonin in their ability to bind rzrp (data not shown).
the difference in kd values between in vitro translated rzrp
and rzrp extracted from nuclei suggests a post-translational
modification of the receptor. a serum component, as indicated
by our finding that theec,, value of rzrp for  xxxd2559xxx  was
lower in the presence of depleted serum than in its absence
(fig. 21, may provide the modification. this modification could
be phosphorylation by protein kinasesactivated through signal
