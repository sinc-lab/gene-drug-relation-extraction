as a latent  xxxg786xxx  cys-30 homodimer (3, 4) through a
secretion pathway that is independent of the conventional
route mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (er)-golgi apparatus (3) but is sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd1800xxx  and
cycloheximide (2).
we have partially characterized the latent  xxxg786xxx  species
released in vitro in response to temperature stress. the extracellular  xxxg786xxx  homodimer is a component of a high molecular
weight aggregate that contains the extravesicular p40 domain
of synaptotagmin (syn)-1 (5). the full-length syn-1 translation
product (p65) has been implicated in the regulation of exocytotic (6) and endocytotic (7) traffic and, like  xxxg786xxx  (4), syn-1 is
a phosphatidylserine- (8) and heparin-binding protein (9).
whereas the stress-induced  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1-containing
extracellular aggregate is not biologically active and binds
poorly to immobilized heparin (5), the biological and heparinbinding properties of  xxxg786xxx  can be recovered if the aggregate is
treated with a reducing agent such as  xxxd2213xxx  (3)
or with ammonium sulfate (2). it is possible that the latent
character of this  xxxg786xxx  aggregate may represent a physiologic
safeguard to ensure that extracellular  xxxg786xxx  can only signal if
the extracellular environment is appropriate for the cell to
respond to its stimuli; otherwise, it would be rapidly cleared.
indeed, cell-surface-associated heparin-sulfate proteoglycans
are thought to not only present  xxxg786xxx  to its high affinity
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (10) but also to protect  xxxg786xxx  from
degradation by proteolytic enzymes present in the extracellular
milieu during cell migration and proliferation (11, 12).
because  xxxg786xxx  is released in response to heat shock in vitro
as a reducing agent and denaturant-sensitive aggregate with
p40 syn-1 (5), and syn-1 is required for  xxxg786xxx  secretion in
response to heat shock (13), we sought to determine whether
 xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 also exist as an aggregate in vivo in order to
provide a physiologic correlate to the in vitro data. since neural
tissue has served as the traditional source of native  xxxg786xxx  (14)
and early evidence suggested that  xxxg786xxx  is present in neural
tissue as an acid-sensitive high molecular weight aggregate
(15), we sought to determine whether  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1
could be resolved as a heparin-binding aggregate from neutral
extracts of neural tissue. we report that brain-derived  xxxg786xxx 
exists as a multiprotein aggregate with p40 syn-1 and
 xxxg2004xxx , a member of the s100 gene family of calcium-binding
proteins (16, 17) and have been able to utilize a pharmacologic
strategy to illustrate that  xxxg2004xxx  may be a functional component of the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway.

we have previously characterized the release of the
signal peptide sequence-less fibroblast growth factor
(fgf) prototype,  xxxg786xxx , in vitro as a stress-induced
pathway in which  xxxg786xxx  is released as a latent homodimer with the p40 extravesicular domain of p65 synaptotagmin (syn)-1. to determine the biologic relevance
of the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway in vivo, we sought to resolve and characterize from ovine brain a purified fraction that contained both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 and report
that the brain-derived  xxxg786xxx :p40 syn-1 aggregate is associated with the calcium-binding protein,  xxxg2004xxx .
since  xxxg2004xxx  binds the anti-inflammatory compound
 xxxd157xxx  and  xxxg786xxx  is involved in inflammation, we
examined the effects of  xxxd157xxx  on the release of
 xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 in response to stress in vitro. we
report that while  xxxd157xxx  was able to repress the
heat shock-induced release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 in a
concentration-dependent manner, it had no effect on
the constitutive release of p40 syn-1 from p40 syn-1 nih
3t3 cell transfectants. these data suggest the following:
(i)  xxxg786xxx  is associated with syn-1 and  xxxg2004xxx  in vivo;
(ii)  xxxg2004xxx  may be involved in the regulation of  xxxg786xxx 
and p40 syn-1 release in response to temperature stress
in vitro; and (iii) the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway may be
accessible to pharmacologic regulation.

the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway iii
results

brain-derived  xxxg786xxx  exists as a denaturant-sensitive aggregate with syn-1—extracts of ovine brain were prepared at a
neutral ph and subjected to (nh4)2so4 precipitation (50 and
95% saturation) as described under “experimental procedures.” the 95% (nh4)2so4 saturation precipitate was resuspended as described previously (18) and separated into three
batch-eluted fractions (0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 m nacl) by heparinsepharose chromatography. whereas immunoblot analysis of
each eluate revealed the presence of both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1
in all three fractions, only the 1.5 m nacl post-heparin-sepharose eluate was able to produce a reversed phase (rp)-hplc
peak (fig. 1a) that contained both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 by
immunoblot analysis (data not shown). the presence of p40
syn-1 in the 1.5 m nacl post-heparin-sepharose elution fraction was unexpected since recombinant p40 syn-1 has been
observed to elute at a lower (;0.6 m nacl) ionic strength [5]. to
ensure that the post-rp-hplc heparin-binding fraction containing both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 did not contain additional
non-associated proteins, this fraction was again subjected to
analysis by rp-hplc. as shown in fig. 1b, rp-hplc analysis
revealed a single symmetrical peak with a retention time identical to that previously observed (fig. 1a). immunoblot analysis using  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 antibodies confirmed the presence of
both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 in this sample (fig. 2, a and b).
since this fraction (fig. 1b) contained both  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1 and the electrophoretic mobility of the  xxxg786xxx :syn-1 aggregate released in response to temperature stress is denaturant-sensitive (5), we anticipated that treatment of this fraction
with a chaotropic agent should resolve the  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1
components as individual peaks with rp-hplc retention
times identical to their retention times defined by both the
native (fig. 1a) and recombinant (fig. 1d) proteins. therefore,
the brain-derived, post-rp-hplc fraction (fig. 1b) containing
both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 was heated (5 min, 95 °c) in the
presence of 8.0 m guanidine hcl and analyzed by rp-hplc. as
shown in fig. 1c, the fraction containing both  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1 was present, but its absorbance was reduced significantly. in addition, numerous fractions with distinct retention
times were readily visible including a major absorption peak
and fractions previously defined as  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 (fig.
1, a and d). these data suggest that thermal and guanidine
hcl denaturation of the brain-derived post-rp-hplc fraction
(fig. 1b) containing both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 generates additional fractions with different retention times including
peaks with retention times identical to  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1.
thus it is likely that this brain-derived, heparin-binding fraction represents an aggregate that contains  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1 as well as other temperature- and chaotropic-sensitive
components.
the s100 gene family member,  xxxg2004xxx , is a component of
the brain-derived  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 aggregate—since the
major absorption fraction containing both  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1 (fig. 1b) demonstrated an unknown retention time, we
sought to determine its structure. however, automated edman
degradation of this peak failed to yield any information. therefore, this fraction (fig. 1b) was subjected to lysc digestion,
and the peptides were resolved by rp-hplc. automated edman degradation of these peptides demonstrated that this fraction contained a member of the s100 gene family (17), the ovine
homolog of human  xxxg2004xxx  (16). interestingly, the structure of
the  xxxg2004xxx  protein predicted from the bovine (genbanktm
accession number ab001567), murine, and human cdna sequences (16) suggests that  xxxg2004xxx  contains 98 amino acid
residues, 9 of which have cyclic side chains that absorb in the
far-uv area used for detection (19, 20). thus, the high uv

mi). the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human
 xxxg786xxx  and rat p40 syn-1 were prepared as described previously (5, 13).
all antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis at a concentration of
4 mg/ml in blocking buffer as described previously (2) except that an
enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) system (amersham pharmacia
biotech) was used for protein detection.
preparation of brain extracts—ten (1.5 kg) unstripped ovine brains
(pel-freeze® biologicals, rogers, ar) were homogenized in 1.3 volumes
of 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, for 2 min in a waring blender. the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 3 g for 1 h, and the supernatant was
filtered through sterile gauze. the filtrate was subjected to stepwise
salt fractionation with 50 and 95% (nh4)2so4 saturation, and the
precipitates were collected by centrifugation as described (14). the 95%
(nh4)2so4 saturation precipitate was resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.4, and dialyzed for 18 h against 50 volumes of the
resuspension buffer using a spectra/por (mr 12–14,000) dialysis membrane (spectrum medical industries inc., houston, tx). all purification
procedures were performed at 4 °c.
chromatographic analysis of neutral brain extracts—a 2.5 3 22-cm
plastic column containing 25 ml of hydrated heparin-sepharose cl-6b
was equilibrated with 10 volumes of 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, and the
brain extract was adsorbed twice over the immobilized heparin. the
column was washed with at least 10 bed volumes of the resuspension
buffer until the absorbance of the eluate at l 5 280 nm was less than
0.01. three batch fractions were eluted with 100 ml of 50 mm tris-hcl,
ph 7.4, containing 0.4 m nacl, 0.7 m nacl, and 1.5 m nacl, and samples
from each nacl eluate (25 ml) were adsorbed to a c4 column (vydactm,
hesperia, ca) conditioned in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pierce). rphplc was performed as described (18) using a linear gradient of
acetonitrile (40 to 100%) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate
of 1 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at l 5 214 nm. samples
were collected as absorbance peaks independent of volume in 1.0 m
tris-hcl, ph 7.4, in an attempt to maintain aggregate integrity and
analyzed by  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 immunoblot analysis as described (2, 5)
except that the ecl system was used for protein detection. although
many peaks exhibited the presence of both  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 by immunoblot analysis, only the 1.5 m nacl heparin-sepharose elution fraction
contained a unique absorbance peak that contained both  xxxg786xxx  and
syn-1 by immunoblot analysis at a dilution of 1:100. this peak was
re-chromatographed on a microbore 300-å c4 aquapore rp300 column
(perkin-elmer), and bound proteins were eluted as absorbance peaks at
l 5 214 with a linear gradient (40 –100%) of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in
0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.
protein sequencing—approximately 10 mg of protein from the indicated peaks in fig. 1, b and c, were subjected to proteolytic digestion
using lysyl endopeptidase c (boehringer mannheim) as described (73).
peptides were isolated by rp-hplc using an applied biosystems model
130 separation system. isolated peptides were subjected to automated
edman degradation using either an applied biosystems model 473a or
477a protein sequenator. proteins were identified by comparison of the
amino acid sequences obtained for several of these peptides against an
ncbi (national center for biotechnology information) protein sequence data base using the blast (basic local alignment search tool)
program.
pharmacology of  xxxg786xxx  release in response to heat shock—nih
3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx  [2] transfectants and  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p65 syn-1 cotransfectants (13) were grown to 80% confluence on fibronectin-coated
dishes and subjected to temperature stress (41.5 °c, 90 min) under the
conditions previously described (74). where indicated, various concentrations of either  xxxd157xxx  or one of its chemical derivatives were
present during the entire heat shock period. a stock solution of  xxxd157xxx  was freshly prepared in equimolar naoh, and serial dilutions in
phosphate-buffered saline were prepared prior to addition to the cells as
recommended by takeda chemical industries ltd. the compounds were
added in volumes of 160 ml/20 ml of medium. the same volume of naoh
without drug was also added to the cells and found to have no effect on
either protein release, membrane permeability (lactate dehydrogenase
activity), or cell viability. in addition, cells maintained at 37 °c in the
presence or absence of  xxxd157xxx  for the same period were used as a
control. conditioned media were collected and filtered through 0.2-mm
cellulose acetate. aliquots (300 ml) were taken for analysis of lactate
dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in the conditioned media according to
an adaptation of the original method of bergmeyer (75) and sigma
procedure dg1340-uv. the remaining filtrate was treated with fresh
0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °c and processed by heparinsepharose chromatography as described (2).

to room temperature before separation by rp-hplc on a microbore
column. fractions were collected as absorbance peaks, divided in two,
and subjected to  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 immunoblot analysis and protein
sequencing. d, samples of purified human recombinant  xxxg786xxx , rat
recombinant syn-1, and murine recombinant  xxxg2004xxx  were initially
resolved by rp-hplc to identify the retention time for each protein
(data not shown) and then resolved as a mixture by rp-hplc.

fig. 1. purification of a heteromeric aggregate containing
 xxxg786xxx , syn-1, and  xxxg2004xxx  from ovine brain. ovine brain extract
was prepared and separated into three fractions by heparin-sepharose
chromatography as described under “experimental procedures.” data
are reported as a function of relative absorbance and retention time.
the solid line on the chromatogram indicates the development of the
acetonitrile gradient. a, rp-hplc analysis of 25 ml of the post-heparinsepharose 1.5 m nacl eluate. fractions were collected as absorbance
peaks into equal volumes of 1 m tris-hcl, ph 7.4, to conserve aggregate
integrity. aliquots were taken along the chromatogram and probed for
the presence of  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 by immunoblot analysis (data not
shown). although the majority of these fractions contained either
 xxxg786xxx , syn-1 or both, the fractions identified as  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 were
determined by their presence as  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 immunoblot-positive
samples at a dilution of 1:100. the presence of  xxxg2004xxx  was confirmed
by microsequencing. b, the peak containing  xxxg786xxx , syn-1, and  xxxg2004xxx 
from a was rechromatographed by rp-hplc to confirm its retention

absorbance feature of the  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 aggregate (fig.
1b) may be due in part to the extinction coefficient of  xxxg2004xxx 
(fig. 1, c and d). since it was possible to resolve a single
fraction from rp-hplc whose retention time was altered by
treatment with temperature and the chaotropic agent, guanidine hcl, we suggest that  xxxg2004xxx  is a component of a multiprotein  xxxg786xxx - and p40 syn-1-containing aggregate and that
 xxxg2004xxx  is also present in this aggregate as a protein with a
blocked amino terminus.
it is important to note that the major absorption peak in fig.
1c, resulting from the denaturation of the fraction (fig. 1b)
containing  xxxg786xxx , p40 syn-1, and  xxxg2004xxx , exhibited a distinct retention time, yet immunoblot analysis of this major
absorption peak demonstrated the presence of low levels of
 xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 (data not shown). since members of the
s100 gene family are known to self-associate (21) and to associate with membrane phospholipids (22), it is possible that the
major absorption peak in fig. 1b may contain  xxxg2004xxx  aggregates as well as other peptidic and non-protein components
such as acidic phospholipids. thus, denaturation of the multimeric aggregate in fig. 1b containing p40 syn-1,  xxxg2004xxx ,
and  xxxg786xxx , with temperature and treatment with guanidine
hcl resulted in only a partial disruption of the aggregate. in
addition, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the  xxxg786xxx ,
p40 syn-1, and  xxxg2004xxx -containing peak resolved in fig. 1, a
and b, is the result of nonspecific protein aggregation under
rp-hplc conditions. however, it is noteworthy that recombinant  xxxg2004xxx  elutes from immobilized heparin between 0.2
and 0.4 m nacl (data not shown), and recombinant p40 syn-1
elutes from heparin-sepharose at 0.7 m nacl (5). since the
brain-derived, post-heparin-sepharose fraction containing p40
syn-1,  xxxg786xxx , and  xxxg2004xxx  was isolated as a high affinity (1.5
m nacl elution peak) heparin-binding fraction prior to resolution by rp-hplc, it is likely that  xxxg2004xxx  and p40 syn-1
gained high heparin binding affinity through their ability to
associate with  xxxg786xxx  prior to analysis by rp-hplc.
interestingly, automated edman degradation of the  xxxg786xxx 
fraction (fig. 1c) derived from treatment of the  xxxg786xxx ,
 xxxg2004xxx , and p40 syn-1 aggregate (fig. 1b) with temperature
and guanidine hcl also failed to yield information. however,
automated edman degradation of lysc fragments derived
from the  xxxg786xxx  peak (fig. 1c) demonstrated that it was present as a protein with a blocked amino terminus that has previously been characterized as fgf-1b (residues 1–154) (23).
unfortunately, however, it was not possible to collect sufficient
material from the p40 syn-1 peak described in fig. 1c for
structural analysis, but it was possible to confirm the identity
of this peak by syn-1 immunoblot analysis (data not shown).
likewise, automated edman degradation of the remaining
peaks described in fig. 1c did not yield any information, and
sufficient material was not available for analysis by lysc digestion. these data imply that the ovine brain-derived, heparin-binding and denaturant-sensitive aggregate resolved by
rp-hplc (fig. 1b) contains at least fgf-1b, p40 syn-1, and
 xxxg2004xxx . furthermore, these data also provide an in vivo
correlate to the presence of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 as a dena-

turant-sensitive aggregate that is released into the extracellular compartment in response to temperature stress in vitro (5).
the  xxxg2004xxx -binding, anti-allergic, and anti-inflammatory
drug,  xxxd157xxx , represses the stress-induced release of
 xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 in vitro—because (i)  xxxg2004xxx  was purified as an aggregate with  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 from ovine
brain, (ii) elevated  xxxg786xxx  levels are associated with inflammatory environments in vivo (24), (iii) syn-1 is released as a p40
fragment in response to temperature stress (5) and is required
for heat shock-induced  xxxg786xxx  secretion (13), (iv) the anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic compound,  xxxd157xxx , binds
 xxxg2004xxx  (ref. 25; genbanktm accession number ab001567),
(v)  xxxd157xxx  is able to interfere with the release of intracellular granules from basophils and mast cells (26), and (vi) nih
3t3 cells express the  xxxg2004xxx  transcript (data not shown), we
sought to determine whether  xxxd157xxx  would be able to modify the stress-induced release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 from
nih3t3 cells in vitro. nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx :b-galactosidase
(gal) and p65 syn-1 co-transfectants were subjected to temperature stress (90 min, 41.5 °c) as described previously (13) in
the absence and presence of  xxxd157xxx . the conditioned medium was treated with dithiothreitol, adsorbed to heparinsepharose, and the presence of  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and syn-1 assessed
by immunoblot analysis as described previously (2). as shown
in fig. 3, a and b,  xxxd157xxx  was able to repress the release of
both  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p40 syn-1 in response to temperature
stress. the inhibition of  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p40 syn-1 release was
dependent upon the concentration of  xxxd157xxx  and was
within the concentration range that exhibits pharmacologic
effects as an anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory agent (27–29).
similar  xxxd157xxx  concentrations were also able to inhibit the
release of  xxxg786xxx  from  xxxg786xxx  nih 3t3 cell transfectants in
vitro (fig. 5). because of the possibility that  xxxd157xxx  may
also possess broad inhibitory activity upon conventional cellular secretion, we evaluated the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to repress
the release of a synthetic form of  xxxg786xxx  engineered to enter
into the conventional er-golgi-mediated secretion pathway

(30). exposure of nih 3t3 cells stably transfected with the
 xxxg789xxx  signal peptide sequence:  xxxg786xxx  chimera (30) to  xxxd157xxx  did not result in inhibition of the constitutive secretion of
the  xxxg786xxx  chimera (data not shown). furthermore, the forced
secretion of  xxxg786xxx  is known to induce a prominent transformed
nih 3t3 cell phenotype in vitro (30), and  xxxd157xxx  was
unable to modify this phenotype. additionally, the p40 extravesicular fragment of syn-1 is constitutively released in p40
syn-1 nih 3t3 cell transfectants, and this release is potentiated by heat shock treatment (13). whereas this constitutive
release of p40 syn-1 occurs by an unknown pathway, the temperature-enhanced release of p40 from these cells appears to
utilize the regulated  xxxg786xxx  release mechanism (13). thus, we
examined the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to influence the release of
p40 syn-1 from the nih 3t3 cell p40 syn-1 transfectants, and
we observed that  xxxd157xxx  was not able to block the constitutive release of p40 from cells maintained at 37 °c (fig. 4,
lanes 1, 3 and 4). however,  xxxd157xxx  was able to repress the
temperature-sensitive component of p40 syn-1 release (fig. 4,
lane 5 versus lane 2) in vitro. finally, all experiments were
monitored for cell lysis and changes in the permeability of the
plasma membrane by measuring the levels of the cytosolic
enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in the conditioned media of all
samples, and no significant differences in extracellular lactate
dehydrogenase levels were observed among the various treatments and conditions. we therefore suggest that  xxxd157xxx ,
the  xxxg2004xxx -binding compound, is able to significantly repress
the temperature stress-induced release of both  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1.
chemical modification of  xxxd157xxx  reduces its ability to
repress the release of p40 syn-1 and  xxxg786xxx  in response to
temperature stress in vitro—to provide a structural basis for
the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to repress the release of  xxxg786xxx  and
p40 syn-1 from its full-length (p65 syn-1) precursor in vitro, we
obtained several chemical derivatives of  xxxd157xxx  (fig. 5)
with variable anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities.

1b was divided in two, and each aliquot was independently resolved by sds-page (12.5% acrylamide) under reducing conditions as described
under “experimental procedures.” lane 1 contains 50 ng of recombinant rat syn-1 protein; lane 2 contains 50 ng of recombinant human fgf-1a
(residues 21–154); lane 3 contains the chromatographic peak obtained from fig. 1b. a represents the syn-1 immunoblot and b the  xxxg786xxx 
immunoblot. note that the  xxxg786xxx  species present in the  xxxg2004xxx  peak (lane 3) migrates with a higher relative molecular weight than the
recombinant species (fgf-1a, residues 21–154), and this is consistent with its identification as the  xxxg718xxx  of  xxxg786xxx  (fgf-1b, residues
1–154) [18].

the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway iii
discussion

decrease the release of both  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 from nih
3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx  transfectants in response to temperature stress
in vitro. as shown in fig. 5, immunoblot analysis of media
conditioned by heat shock in the presence or absence of either
 xxxd157xxx  (aa673) or one of its derivatives revealed that while
derivatives aa617 and aa648 were able to repress  xxxg786xxx 
release, derivative aa777 was not able to do so. syn-1 immunoblot analysis of these samples also demonstrated that  xxxd157xxx  derivatives aa617 and aa648 but not derivative aa777
were able to inhibit the release of p40 syn-1 from endogenous
p65 syn-1 in response to temperature stress (data not shown).
these data suggest that either substitution of the isopropyl
side chain with an acetyl group or deletion of the amino group
at the opposite end of the molecule does not reduce the ability
of  xxxd157xxx  to repress  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 release in response to temperature stress in vitro. however, substitution of
the isopropyl side chain with a methyl group generates an
 xxxd157xxx  derivative that is unable to repress the release of
either  xxxg786xxx  (fig. 5) or p40 syn-1 (data not shown) in response
to heat shock. these data suggest that the major functional
group within the structure of  xxxd157xxx  that is able to modify
 xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 release is the hydrophobic side chain,
including the maintenance of at least a two-carbon unit.

nih 3t3 cells stably transfected with human  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and rat p65
syn-1 by exposure to 41.5 °c for 90 min. the media were collected and

instructions (amersham pharmacia biotech) and re-probed for syn-1.
lane descriptors are identical to those described in a.

we have utilized primarily in vitro methods to characterize
the mechanism for the extracellular release of  xxxg786xxx  as a
non-conventional release pathway since brefelden a, a drug
which disrupts the classical er-golgi secretion pathway, does
not inhibit the release of  xxxg786xxx  in response to temperature
stress (2, 3). within the extracellular compartment in vitro,
 xxxg786xxx  exists as a latent cys-30 homodimer (3) associated with
the p40 extravesicular domain of syn-1 (5). this aggregate is
detergent- and reducing agent-sensitive, and electrophoretic
mobility shift analysis anticipated the presence of additional
components (5). in order to determine whether the information
obtained from the characterization of the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway in vitro could be applied to an in vivo situation, we pursued
the isolation of a multiprotein aggregate from ovine brain that
contained  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1, and we report that the brainderived  xxxg786xxx :syn-1 aggregate also contains the calcium-binding protein,  xxxg2004xxx  (16), a member of the s100 gene family of
ef-hand-containing ca21-binding modulator proteins (17).
the s100 gene family members (31) encode low molecular
weight acidic polypeptides containing two ca21-binding efhand motifs flanked by two hydrophobic domains (17, 32).
 xxxg2004xxx  also exhibits these structural features, and in contrast with other s100 gene family members, it contains a carboxyl-terminal domain that is rich in basic amino acid residues
(16). whereas all tissues express at least one member of the
s100 gene family, the cellular distribution is specific for members of the s100 gene family (17). in this regard it is interesting
that like  xxxg786xxx  (1) and syn-1 (33), s100 proteins are highly
enriched in neural tissue (34, 35). however,  xxxg2004xxx  expression is not limited to neural tissue, and with the possible
exception of leukocytes,  xxxg2004xxx  expression is ubiquitous in
other organs, tissues, and cell types (16) including its presence
in nih 3t3 cells. interestingly, some members of the s100 gene
family have been found to be associated with the nucleus (36),
although most are cytosolic and can be associated with the
endoplasmic reticulum and actin stress fibers (37). however,
like  xxxg786xxx  (2), several s100 gene family members are released
from cells in vitro (17, 38) despite the absence of a conventional
signal peptide sequence for classical er-golgi-mediated secretion. furthermore, even though no specific cell-surface receptor
has been identified for these extracellular s100 gene family
members (34, 39), some do possess extracellular functions including the regulation of neuronal differentiation (40 – 42),
the stimulation of melanoma and glial cell proliferation and
migration (35, 43), and chemotactic activities (44, 45). indeed,
it is interesting that  xxxg786xxx  is also able to accomplish these
functions as well (1).
since  xxxg2006xxx  and s100a9 are released from monocytes
through a novel er-golgi-independent pathway that requires
an intact tubulin network (38), it is not perhaps surprising that
 xxxg2004xxx  may be a component of the  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1
er-golgi-independent release pathway. indeed, the release of
 xxxg2006xxx  by monocytes and activated neutrophils coincides with
the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin
(il)-1a by these cells (46). this is interesting since the il-1 and
fgf gene family prototypes most likely evolved without classical signal peptide sequences from a common primordial gene
(23). the il-1 and the fgf gene family prototypes also exhibit
sequence homologies (47, 48) including very similar crystallographic structures (49, 50). like  xxxg2006xxx  and the il-1 prototypes,  xxxg786xxx  is also expressed during inflammatory situations
in vivo (24) and is thought to be released during these situations. thus, it is also not surprising that the anti-allergic and
anti-inflammatory  xxxg2004xxx -binding compound,  xxxd157xxx 
((25) genbanktm accession number ab001567), is able to re-

co-transfectants. media were conditioned by two 150-nm dishes of nih 3t3 cells stably co-transfected with  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and rat p40 syn-1 after
exposure to temperature stress (41.5 °c, 90 min) with or without treatment. the media were collected and resolved by 10% acrylamide sds-page
under reducing conditions followed by immunoblot analysis for syn-1 as described under “experimental procedures.” 1st lane, media derived from
nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p40 syn-1 co-transfectants maintained at 37 °c for 90 min. 2nd lane, media derived from nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx :b-gal
and p40 syn-1 co-transfectants following heat shock. 3rd and 4th lanes, media derived from nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p40 syn-1
co-transfectants maintained at 37 °c in the presence of 5 3 1025 and 3 3 1024 m aa673 ( xxxd157xxx ), respectively. 5th lane, media derived from
nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx :b-gal and p40 syn-1 co-transfectants following heat shock in the presence of 3 3 1024 m, aa673. 6th lane, 50 ng of recombinant
rat p40 syn-1.

press the release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40-syn-1 in response to temperature stress in vitro.
although we have not determined whether  xxxg2004xxx  is released in a brefelden a-insensitive manner with  xxxg786xxx  and p40
syn-1 in response to cellular stress in vitro, our data do suggest
that  xxxg2004xxx  may be at least a component of the intracellular
multiprotein aggregate involved in the regulation  xxxg786xxx  release. interestingly, s100 proteins (22) syn-1 (8) and  xxxg786xxx  (4)
are all well characterized as acidic phospholipid-binding proteins and since the p40 syn-1 and  xxxg786xxx  components of the
aggregate released from cells in response to heat shock are
sensitive to denaturing agents, it is possible that the ability of
these proteins to interact with phosphatidylserine may be a
common feature of other unknown protein components of this
release pathway. indeed, gel shift analysis of the denaturantsensitive component of the low heparin-binding affinity p40
syn-1 and  xxxg786xxx  aggregate (5) anticipated the presence of a
protein (;10 kda) with an apparent molecular weight similar
to that predicted from the  xxxg2004xxx  cdna (16).
since the fgf prototypes are well known for their angiogenic potential (47, 48) and tumor metastasis and growth is

dependent upon tumor angiogenesis in vivo (51, 52), it is also
not surprising that the expression of many of the s100 gene
family members correlates with metastatic tumor potential
(53–56), and in one instance is diagnostic for human melanoma
metastatic potential (57, 58). indeed, it is possible that s100
gene family members support neoplastic and pro-inflammatory
situations in vivo by their ability to participate in the release
pathway for extracellular signal peptide-less angiogenic and
inflammatory signals such as  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg1169xxx . interestingly,
several s100 gene family members are also known to interact
with members of the annexin gene family (59 – 61), and like
syn-1 and s100 gene family members, the annexins are ca21dependent acidic phospholipid-binding proteins (62). annexin
ii is a particularly interesting member of this family since it
has been implicated in the regulation of exocytosis (63, 64), and
this activity appears to be mediated by its ability to be associated with  xxxg2002xxx  (p11) to form an annexin ii2-p112 aggregate
(65, 66). whereas  xxxg165xxx  is known to interact with plasminogen and plasminogen activators on the cell surface (67),
 xxxg165xxx , like  xxxg2004xxx  and  xxxg786xxx , does not contain a classical signal sequence for er-golgi-mediated secretion (63, 68).

although it is not known whether  xxxg2004xxx  is able to interact
with  xxxg165xxx  on the inner surface of the plasma membrane,
annexins i through v were identified together with  xxxg2004xxx  as
 xxxd157xxx -binding proteins (25).
the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to repress the release of  xxxg786xxx  and
the extravesicular p40 domain of p65 syn-1 from nih 3t3 cells
in response to heat shock is noteworthy since  xxxg2004xxx  is an
 xxxd157xxx -binding protein (25). thus it is possible that  xxxd157xxx  may interfere with the putative interaction between
intracellular  xxxg2004xxx  and the  xxxg786xxx  and syn-1 aggregate.
since  xxxd157xxx  does not repress the appearance of the constitutively released p40 syn-1 fragment in vitro, it is possible
that  xxxd157xxx  may be able to target the interaction between
 xxxg2004xxx  and the putative  xxxg786xxx  and p65 syn-1 aggregate.
however, it is also possible that  xxxd157xxx  may be interactive
with other intracellular acidic phospholipid-binding proteins
including members of the annexin gene family. indeed, it is
intriguing that the  xxxg2004xxx  (22),  xxxg786xxx  (4), and syn-1 (8)
components of this novel release pathway bind membrane
phospholipids, since the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to interfere with
either the metabolism or the membrane release of lipid mediators of the inflammatory response, such as  xxxd208xxx 
derivatives, has served as the basis to explain the mechanism
of action of  xxxd157xxx  pharmacology (26 –29).
access to structural analogs of  xxxd157xxx  has enabled us to
define the importance of the isopropyl side chain as a functional element of its ability to repress the heat shock-induced
release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 in vitro. since the modification
of the amino group as well as conversion of the isopropyl side
chain to an ethyl group did not influence the effectiveness of
 xxxd157xxx  to repress  xxxg786xxx  release in response to temperature stress, we suggest that these derivatives may serve as
appropriate negative controls for these in vitro studies. indeed,
the general effect of these drugs on membrane permeability
was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase, and
 xxxd157xxx  was not able to augment the presence of lactate
dehydrogenase in the extracellular compartment under any
condition. interestingly,  xxxd1763xxx , the parent drug used as the
model for the development of  xxxd157xxx  (69, 70), was also able
to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the release of  xxxg786xxx  and
p40 syn-1 from nih 3t3 cell  xxxg786xxx  transfectants in response
to temperature stress, but the data are not shown because
contrary to  xxxd157xxx ,  xxxd1763xxx  treatment resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in membrane permeability as
measured by the presence of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase in
the extracellular compartment.
these data also reinforce the biological significance of the
 xxxg786xxx  release pathway previously elucidated by the use of in
vitro methods (2–5, 13) since insight into the role of  xxxg2004xxx  as
a potential participant in the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway was derived from in vivo data using extracts of ovine brain. since (i)
the brain-derived aggregate appears to be partially resistant to
both temperature denaturation and treatment with guanidine
hcl, (ii) the known components of the brain-derived multiprotein aggregate bind acidic phospholipids, and (iii) the functional group within the structure of  xxxd157xxx  responsible for
the inhibition of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syn-1 release in vitro is the
non-polar isopropyl side chain, we anticipate that phospholipid
metabolism may not only play an important role in the mechanism of  xxxg786xxx  homodimer release but also in the regulation of
the unknown intracellular responsibilities assumed by the
 xxxg786xxx  monomer. with regard to the latter, we suggest that
since s100 gene family members are well characterized as
