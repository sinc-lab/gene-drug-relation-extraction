highly enantioselective epoxidation of  xxxd2563xxx  (vitamin
k3) mediated by new cinchona alkaloid phase-transfer catalysts

abstract: in the area of catalytic asymmetric epoxidation, the highly enantioselective transformation of cyclic
enones and quinones is an extremely
challenging target. with the aim to develop new and highly effective phasetransfer catalysts for this purpose, we
conducted a systematic structural variation of ptcs based on quinine and
quinachtungreidine. in the total of 15 new quaternary ammonium ptcs, modifications included, for example, the exchange of the quinine methoxy group
for a free hydroxyl or other alkoxy substituents, and the introduction of additional elements of chirality through alkylation of the alkaloid quinuclidine ni-

trogen atom by chiral electrophiles.
for example, the well-established 9anthracenylmethyl group was exchanged for a “chiral” anthracene in
the form of 9-chloromethyl-[(1,8-s;4,5r)-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-1,4:5,8-dimethanoanthracene. the asymmetric
epoxidation of  xxxd2563xxx  was used as
the test reaction for our novel ptcs.
the readily available ptc 10 (derived
from quinine in three convenient and
high-yielding steps) proved to be the

introduction
enantiomerically pure epoxides are valuable intermediates
in the asymmetric synthesis of, for example, pharmaceuticals
and natural products in both academic and industrial laboratories.[1] in most cases, epoxides are prepared by oxygen
transfer from a terminal oxidant to a c=c-double bond, and
the recent years have seen a dramatic development of various methods for the catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of olefins.[2, 3] for the epoxidation of electron-deficient substrates
such as enones, enoates or quinones, nucleophilic oxidants
such as alkaline solutions of hydroperoxides,  xxxd2298xxx  (weitz–scheffer epoxidation) or hypohalites are often

most enantioselective catalyst for this
purpose known to date: at a catalyst
loading of only 2.50 mol %, the quinone epoxide was obtained in 76 %
yield and with 85 % ee (previously:
 34 % ee), using commercial bleach
(aqueous sodium hypochlorite) as the
oxidant. to rationalize the sense of induction effected by our novel phasetransfer catalysts, a computational analysis of steric interactions in the intermediate chlorooxy enolate–ptc ion
pair was conducted. based on this analysis, the sense of induction for all 15
novel ptcs could be consistently explained.

applied.[4–9] in fact, asymmetric weitz–scheffer-type epoxidations with chiral ptcs belong to the earliest examples of
asymmetric catalysis in general: in 1978, wynberg et al. reported the asymmetric epoxidation of chalcones 1 a, b
(scheme 1) using chiral quaternary ammonium salts derived
from quinine (2) and quinidine (3) (figure 1). using the
benzylquininium chloride 4 a as the ptc (scheme 1) up to
54 % ee of epoxide 5 a were achieved.[10–12]
major breakthroughs in the phase-transfer catalyzed epoxidation of chalcones 1 a, b resulted from work by corey
et al. (ptc 4 b),[13] lygo et al. (ptc 4 b),[14, 15] arai, shioiri

despite these excellent results, few procedures for the
synthesis of the epoxides of quinones and quinone acetals
by asymmetric epoxidation appear to exist.[17–19] oxiranes of
the latter type are valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical and natural products. 2- xxxd2563xxx  ( xxxd2563xxx  (7), scheme 2) has often served as the touchstone
for catalyst performance, because it is a particularly challenging substrate with respect to enantioselective epoxidation. in fact, a maximum ee of 78 % at 32 % yield was
achievachtungreed by taylor et al., using carbohydrate-derived chiral
hydroperoxides as stoichiometric oxidizing agents.[18–19] as
far as asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis is concerned, the
best ee value (34 %) at 86 % yield was obtained by arai,
shioiri et al. using catalyst 8 and alkaline  xxxd2298xxx 
as the oxidant (scheme 2).[16, 20]
therefore, a highly efficient catalytic enantioselective approach still remains a challenging task. herein we present a
detailed study regarding the catalyst and the oxidant in
order to probe the catalyst structure–reactivity relationship.
for catalyst optimization, our strategy is based on two main
ideas. first, enhancing the catalyst–substrate interaction by
additional hydrogen bonding, and second improving the
asymmetric induction by introduction of further elements of
chirality (figure 2).

as it turned out, in particular the use of aqueous sodium
hypochlorite as oxidant in combination with catalyst 10
bearing a hydroxyl group at the c6’ atom of the quinoline
ring improved the enantioselectivity tremendously: up to
85 % ee and 73 % yield were achieved for the epoxide 9, at
a catalyst loading of 2.5 mol %. this value represents the
best enantioselectivity reported thus far (scheme 3).

a remarkable improvement in the enantioselectivity was
found when sodium hypochlorite (commercial bleach) was
used as oxidant (table 1, entries 2–5). at a catalyst loading
of 10 mol % (relative to the enone), excellent conversions
and ee values up to 72 % were achieved in chlorobenzene at
10 8c with catalyst 12. at lower catalyst loading (1 mol %),
an epoxide ee of 76 % resulted (table 1, entries 4 and 5).
chlorobenzene was chosen as solvent as it consistently provided the highest ee values of the product epoxide (table 1,
entries 2, 4–7). obviously, the sense of induction is dominated by the configuration of the alkaloid moiety. using quinine derivative 11, epoxide enantiomer 9 is formed predominantly, whereas the pseudo-enantiomeric quinidine derivative 12 leads to epoxide ent-9, as the major enantiomer
(table 1, entries 2 and 4).

as shown in table 2 (entry 1) the quinine-derived ptc 11
forms the epoxide enantiomer 9 predominantly in the
(2r,3s)-configuration. interestingly, the introduction of a
benzyl functionality at the c9 atom of the quinine-based
ptc 11 switches the sense of stereoinduction: with catalyst
11 (table 2, entry 1), 67 % ee was obtained in favour of the
epoxide 9. however, using the catalyst 13 having the quinine
scaffold and a benzyl group at c9 (table 2, entry 3) yielded
the opposite enantiomer ent-9 in 50 % ee. for the quinidinebased o-benzylated catalyst 14, the same tendency was observed (table 2, entries 2 and 4). the 9-epi-isomer 16 produced epoxide ent-9 in 51 % ee (table 2, entry 6). in the
case of ptc 17 (alcohol functionality at c6’ and a o-benzyl
group at c9), the ee of the epoxide ent-9 decreased significantly to 20 % (table 2, entry 7). nearly no enantioselectivity was induced by the rigid ptc 15 (table 2, entry 5).
modifications at the quinuclidine nitrogen atom: we also investigated the possibility to enhance the enantioselectivity
of the alkaloid-based catalysts by introducing further elements of chirality at the quinuclidine core. with respect to
the performance of catalysts 11 and 12, we envisaged that
the combination of quinine (2) and quinidine (3) with both
enantiomers of the chiral benzyl halides 20 and 21
(scheme 6) as chiral and bulky aromatic groups would be effective in improving the enantioselectivity. clearly, a matched–mismatched situation should result for the quaternary
catalysts 22–27 (figure 4).
as shown in scheme 6, we prepared 20 and ent-20 by reduction/chlorination from the corresponding aldehydes[26–28]
(28 and ent-28) in 70–80 % overall yield. for the synthesis of
the binaphthyl electrophile 21, we followed the literature

catalytic activity of the ptcs 22–27: with these catalysts in
hand, we proceeded to evaluate their performance in the
asymmetric epoxidation of  xxxd2563xxx  (7). the results are
summarized in table 3.
in all cases, naphthoquinone 7 was epoxidised in good
yields (up to 87 %, see table 3). the sense of stereoinduction is clearly dominated by the sense of chirality of the alkaloid moiety. moderate enantioselectivities resulted from
the use of both diastereomers of the quininium salts 22 and
23. clearly, 23 is the matched catalyst with a maximum of
54 % ee (table 3, entry 2), while the mismatched catalyst 22
yielded a mere 15 % ee (table 3, entry 1). similarly pronounced effects were observed for the n-binaphthylmethyl

in analogy to the synthetic route above, the corresponding
hydrogenated ptcs 10 and 35 (quinine-based) and 36 and
37 (quinidine-based) were prepared in 34–63 % overall yield
(figure 5).

substituted quinidinium ptcs 26 and 27 (table 3, entries 6
and 7): in the matched case (27), epoxide ent-9 was obtained
in 71 % ee, whereas its diastereomer ptc 26 generated ent-9
with only 40 % ee. the best results were achieved with catalyst 24. in the presence of only 1 mol % of this salt, enantioselectivities up to 79 % ee (table 3, entries 3–4) were observed. in this case, the mismatched diastereomer 25 furnished the epoxide ent-9 in good yield but with no more
than 47 % ee (table 3, entry 5).
modifications at the c6’ atom: another variation of the cinchona-alkaloid scaffold involves a modification of the ether
at the c6’ position of the quinoline core. two sets of quinidine-based ptcs were synthesized. in the first series, the
ptcs maintained the “natural” double bond at c10,c11. in
the second set, this position was hydrogenated. exemplarily,
the synthetic route leading to the non-hydrogenated quinidine based ptcs 31 and 32 is shown in scheme 7. first, the
methyl ether at c6’of quinidine (3) was cleaved to yield the
phenol 33. further alkylation with 2-bromopropane gave
the ether 34. subsequent quaternisation of 33 and 34 with 9chloromethylanthracene gave salts 31 and 32 in 73 and 67 %
yield, respectively.

ized in table 4, in the quinidine series (table 4, entries 1–5),
the literature known catalyst 12 (scheme 4) with a methoxy
group at the quinoline moiety (c6’) gave the best enantioselectivity of 72 % (table 4, entry 1). neither a free hydroxyl
at c6’ (ptc 31) nor a more bulky isopropyl substituent at
this position (ptc 32) could enhance the enantioselectivity
(table 4, entries 2 and 3).

also in the case of the quinine scaffold, the effects of
these modifications were studied. to our delight, ptc 10
bearing two free hydroxyl groups (c9 and c6’) and a hydrogenated double bond (c10,c11) afforded the highest enantioselectivity of 85 % ee with good yields (table 4, entry 6).
these values are the highest reported ever in the catalytic
asymmetric epoxidation of  xxxd2563xxx  (7). on the other
hand, increasing the steric demand at the c6’ position by introduction of an isopropyl ether (ptc 35), the enantioselectivity dropped to 59 % ee (table 4, entry 7). given these results, no ptcs with a sterically bulkier ether functionality at
the c6’ atom of the quinoline were tested in this reaction.

a. berkessel et al.

the configuration at c8 and c9 of the alkaloid. as shown in
table 2 (entries 1 and 3), the etherification of the hydroxyl
group at c9 led to a switch in the epoxide configuration.
we have presented herein that small variations at the
scaffold of the cinchona-alkaloid ptcs may have dramatic
effects on the enantioselectivity of the epoxidation. for instance, a free phenol functionality at c6’ of the quinoline
core gave rise to remarkably increased enantioselectivity
(10, 85 % ee; table 4, entry 6).
we applied coreyrs approach to rationalise our observations.[32, 33] corey et al. presented a model aimed to determine the geometrical factors which are responsible for the
enantioselectivity in the catalytic, asymmetric alkylation of
glycine imine esters using cinchona-alkaloid based phasetransfer catalysts.[32]
in this approach, the nitrogen atom of the quinuclidine
core is regarded as the centre of a tetrahedron. a highly
enantioselective phase-transfer catalyst should be structured
in a way to provide only one open tetrahedron face for interaction with the substrate. due to the structure of the cinchona-alkaloids, one face is blocked by the quinuclidine ring
system. in a quaternary ammonium salt (e.g. ptc 12,
scheme 4) a second face is shielded by the 9-anthracenylmethyl moiety.[32–34] the configuration at c9 of the alkaloid
determines the spatial arrangement of the quinoline moiety
and this substituent blocks the third face of the tetrahedron.
one face remains open for the catalyst–substrate interaction
(in figure 6, the face defined by c8, c2 and the benzylic c
atom cbn).
it is assumed that the oxidation described herein is—
mechanistically—an asymmetric version of the two-step
weitz–scheffer epoxidation:[35] in this process, the first step
is a reversible nucleophilic attack of the anionic oxidant
(ocl in our case) at the michael system to form the enolates 38 and ent-38, followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution to yield the epoxides 9 and ent-9
(scheme 8). in the case of  xxxd2563xxx  (7), the nucleophilic
attack most likely occurs at c3, as c2 is sterically more hindered.[35]
previous kinetic and mechanistic studies of the epoxidation of chalcone derivatives indicate a change in the rate-determining step depending on the electron density of the substrate.[36, 37] thus, for chalcones with electron-withdrawing
groups attached at the b-position of the carbonyl group, the
electron density at this carbon is reduced so that the attack
of the oxidant (first step) is facilitated.[36, 37] likely, for electron-poor a,b-unsaturated ketones, such as  xxxd2563xxx  (7),
the formation of the racemic enolate 38 is fast and reversible, whereas in contrast the intramolecular ring closure to
form the epoxide is assumed to determine the reaction rate
(scheme 8). in the presence of a chiral quaternary ammonium salt, one of the enolates 38 or ent-38 (scheme 8) presumably coordinates preferentially to the catalyst, impeding the
reversal of the initial michael addition, and allowing smooth
formation of the epoxide.
to shed further light on our model, we carried out conformational analyses (monte carlo search) for the ptcs 10–12,

of the two diastereomeric enolate–catalyst complexes for
these ptcs; for better comparison the complexes with the
lowest minimum energy are depicted on the top of each

ptc cation involves i) coulombic interaction (ion pairing);
ii) hydrogen bonding between the proton of the hydroxy
group at c9 of the ptc and the enolate oxygen atom (c1);
and iii) p–p stacking of the anthracenyl moiety and the aromatic portion of the substrate enone. the energy values, the
distances for ion pairing, hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking of the above complexes are summarized in table 5.

general procedure for the quaternisation of tertiary amines
under an argon atmosphere, the benzyl halide (1.10 equiv) was added to
a highly concentrated solution of the amine (1.00 equiv) in dry thf. the
reaction mixture was heated under reflux until tlc analysis showed the
complete consumption of the amine.
work-up a: the yellow precipitate was filtered off and purified—if necessary—by flash chromatography (chcl3/meoh 9:1) or recrystallization.
work-up b: the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the
residue purified by flash chromatography (chcl3/meoh 9:1).
general procedure for the alkylation of phenols
cesium carbonate (2.50 equiv) was added to a stirred solution of the alkaloid (1.00 equiv) in dry dmf (0.02 m) and stirred at rt for 10 min.
the bromoalkane (2.00 equiv) was added, and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 40 h at 60 8c. the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting solid was purified by flash chromatography
(chcl3/meoh 9:1). the desired product was obtained as a solid.

350 mmol, 0.07 equiv) were added to the solution. the reaction was stirred and heated to reflux for one hour. after cooling to 0 8c, the precipitates were filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced
pressure to give the bromide 21. the latter was used directly for the subsequent reaction without any purification. the crude bromide was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (25 ml), quinidine (3, 1.06 g, 3.26 mmol,
1.00 equiv) was added, and the reaction was stirred and heated under
reflux under argon atmosphere overnight. after cooling to room temperature, the solids were collected, washed with tetrahydrofuran and recrystallized from dichloromethane to give the ammonium salt 26 as a colourless solid (1.22 g, 32 %). m.p. > 192 8c (decomp); [a]20

1-n-((s)-methyl-2-[1,1’]-binaphthyl)quinidinium bromide (27): this compound was synthesized in the same manner as described for 26, starting
from (r)-2-methyl-[1,1’]-binaphthalene (43). in the case of 27, after the
reaction with 3, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. the
crude material was dissolved in ch2cl2 (5 ml) and added dropwise to  xxxd2052xxx  (80 ml). the resulting precipitates were filtered off and
washed with  xxxd2052xxx . the remaining solid was purified by chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate/methanol 8:2). recrystallization
from acetone resulted in the salt 27 as a colourless solid (187 mg, 7 %).

6’-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocinchonine (40): a solution of 10,11-dihydroquinidine[42] (419 mg, 1.28 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dry ch2cl2 (40.0 ml) was
placed into a schlenk flask at 78 8c. under vigorous stirring, bbr3
(1.0 m in ch2cl2 ; 5.13 ml, 5.13 mmol, 1.23 g, 4.00 equiv) was added
slowly. the reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature. it was then refluxed at 40 8c for 1 h and was cooled to 5 8c. while
stirring and maintaining the temperature, a 10 % solution of aqueous
sodium hydroxide (10 ml) was added. the basic aqueous solution was
separated from the organic phase and washed with ch2cl2 (15 ml). hydrochloric acid (2 m) was added dropwise until a colourless solid precipitated (approx. ph 8). extraction with chloroform, drying of the organic
phase with  xxxd2534xxx  and evaporating to dryness yielded the desired product 39 as a colourless solid (227 mg, 57 %). rf = 0.21 (chloroform/methanol 9:1); m.p. 172 8c (lit.:[43] 170 8c); [a]20
