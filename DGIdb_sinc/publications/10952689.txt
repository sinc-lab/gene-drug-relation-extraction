1  xxxd2258xxx  is a widely used antimalarial agent which has been associated with prolongation of
the `qt interval' of the electrocardiogram (ecg), torsades de pointes and sudden death. whilst qt
prolongation is consistent with  xxxd2258xxx -induced increases in cardiac ventricular action potential
duration, the cellular mechanism for these observations has not been previously reported.
2 the delayed recti®er  xxxg1232xxx , ikr, is a primary site of action of drugs causing qt
prolongation and is encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ). we examined the
eects of  xxxd2258xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  potassium channels stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary
(cho-k1) cells.
3  xxxd2258xxx  blocked  xxxg1246xxx  tail currents elicited on repolarization to 760 mv from +30 mv
with an ic50 of 196.9 nm. the therapeutic plasma concentration range for  xxxd2258xxx  is 1.67 ±
2.98 mm.
4 channel inhibition by  xxxd2258xxx  exhibited time-, voltage- and use-dependence.  xxxd2258xxx 
did not alter the time course of channel activation or deactivation, but inactivation was accelerated
and there was a 20 mv hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady-state
inactivation. block was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated, and channel blockade
increased with increasing duration of depolarizing pulses.
5 we conclude that  xxxg1246xxx  channel inhibition by  xxxd2258xxx  is the likely underlying cellular
mechanism for qt prolongation. our data suggest preferential binding of  xxxd2258xxx  to the open
and inactivated channel states.

introduction
between 300 and 500 million people in the world are infected
with malaria, and 1.5 ± 2.7 million people die from it every year
(pellegrini & ru, 1999).  xxxd2258xxx  is a 9-phenanthrenemethanol antimalarial agent which is particularly eective
against drug-resistant falciparum and vivax malaria. it has
been in wide clinical use since 1984 and clinical trials have
involved at least 3 million patients in more than 30 countries
(kano et al., 1995). in 1993, nosten (nosten et al., 1993),
reported cardiac side eects associated with  xxxd2258xxx 
treatment, (including one sudden death), in a group of patients
on the thai-burmese border. since then there have been
several reports of prolongation of the `qt interval' of the
electrocardiogram (ecg), torsades de pointes and fatal
cardiac arrests in patients taking  xxxd2258xxx  (castot et al.,
1993; monlun et al., 1993; who, 1993; monlun et al., 1995).
one mechanism by which drugs can prolong the qt interval
is through blockade of one or more repolarizing outward
 xxxg1232xxx  currents in ventricular myocytes (rampe et
al., 1998). of these, the delayed-recti®er, ik, is a common site
of action of drugs causing qt lengthening and torsades de

pointes (roden, 1993; thomas,1994; woosley, 1996). there
are two types of ik, rapidly activating, `ikr', and slowly
activating, `iks' (sanguinetti & jurkiewicz, 1990). drugs that
cause torsades de pointes appear to selectively block ikr over
iks ( e.g. dofetilide (carmeliet, 1992; williams & beatch, 1997);
quinidine (balser et al., 1991); e4031 and sotalol (sanguinetti
& jurkiewicz, 1990; wettwer et al., 1992); terfenadine (ming &
nordin, 1995; berul & morad, 1995).
recently, the gene encoding the major subunit of the ikr
channel has been identi®ed as the human ether-a-go-go-related
gene,  xxxg1246xxx , and it is strongly expressed in the heart
(sanguinetti et al., 1995; curran et al., 1995). when transfected
into heterologous cell lines,  xxxg1246xxx  expresses a potassium
channel with properties similar to native ikr (sanguinetti et al.,
1995; trudeau et al., 1995). the pro®le of  xxxg1246xxx  and native
ikr currents during the ventricular action potential have been
recorded in action potential clamp experiments (zhou et al.,
1998; hancox et al., 1998). these studies show that both
 xxxg1246xxx  and native ikr currents develop progressively during
the action potential plateau to reach a maximum amplitude
during phases 2 and 3 (plateau and terminal repolarization
phase) of the action potential. the recorded pro®les provide
direct demonstrations of the crucial role of  xxxg1246xxx /ikr in
ventricular action potential repolarization, and suggest similar
pro®les between cloned and native channels.

h. tie et al

the ®nding that  xxxg1246xxx  encodes ikr is of particular clinical
relevance as mutations in  xxxg1246xxx  cause a major form of the
congenital long qt syndrome (curran et al., 1995) and
blockade of  xxxg1246xxx  by drugs is the likely mechanism
underlying the acquired long qt syndrome. indeed recent
studies from several groups including our own have shown
potent inhibition of transfected  xxxg1246xxx  channels by class iii
(qt prolonging) antiarrhythmic drugs such as dofetilide
(snyders & chaudhary, 1996; ficker et al., 1998) and
amiodarone (kiehn et al., 1999), as well as many non-cardiac
drugs known to cause qt prolongation such as haloperidol
(suessbrich et al., 1997), thoridazine (drolet et al., 1999),
 xxxd3195xxx  (rampe et al., 1998), terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx 
(suessbrich et al., 1996),  xxxd1708xxx  (mohammad et al., 1997;
rampe et al., 1997; walker et al., 1999a) and ketoconazole
(dumaine et al., 1998).
the cellular mechanism underlying qt prolongation and
torsades de pointes associated with  xxxd2258xxx  has not been
previously reported. we therefore investigated the eects of
 xxxd2258xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  channels stably expressed in chinese
hamster ovary (cho-k1) cells.

methods
these have previously been reported by us in detail, including
a full biophysical characterization of the  xxxg1246xxx  channel
(walker et al., 1999b).

molecular biology
the cho-k1 cells (american type culture collection,
bethesda, md, u.s.a.) used in the following experiments
were maintained in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's medium-f12
(dmem-f12, gibco, brl, gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.),
supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum. eukaryotic
expression of  xxxg1246xxx  was performed by directionally cloning
the coding region of the  xxxg1246xxx  gene (gift from dr g.
robertson, department of physiology, university of
wisconsin medical school, madison wi, u.s.a.) into the
expression vector prc/cmv (invitrogen, san diego, ca,
u.s.a.), which also carries the  xxxg418xxx  resistance gene. this
construct was then transfected into cho-k1 cells. cell
monolayers in 35 mm2 dishes were transfected using 9 ml
lipofectamine reagent (gibco, brl) and 1 mg dna.
stably transfected cells were then selected with 1000 mg ml71
 xxxg418xxx  (boehringer, mannheim). these were subcloned to
isolate individual cell clones which expressed substantial
 xxxg1246xxx -related potassium current. individual subclones were
maintained long-term in tissue culture and used for the
patch clamping experiments to be described below.

electrophysiology
currents were recorded at room temperature (20 ± 228c),
using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. cho-k1 cells
plated on coverslips were placed at the bottom of a 2 ml
perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted
phase-contrast microscope (nikon diaphot, nikon corporation, tokyo, japan). electrodes were positioned using a
micromanipulator (narishige wb 90, tokyo, japan). a
silver/silver-chloride reference electrode was placed directly
in the perfusion chamber. membrane potentials were
adjusted by 715 mv to correct for the junction potential
between high k+ pipette and external bath solution
(calculated using commercial software, jpcalc, barry,
british journal of pharmacology, vol 130 (8)

inhibition of  xxxg1246xxx  by  xxxd2258xxx 

1994). cells were patched using micropipettes fabricated
from thin-walled borosilicate glass (vitrex microhematocrit
tubes, modulohm 1/s, denmark) with a vertical pipette
puller (model 720, david kopf instruments, ca, u.s.a.).
tip diameters varied between 0.9 and 1.5 mm (pipette
resistance =5.9+2.9 mo, n=24). currents were ampli®ed
and ®ltered at 2 khz with a 4-pole bessel ®lter (73db
point) using an axopatch 1d ampli®er (axon instruments,
foster city, ca, u.s.a.). currents were sampled at
0.25 khz for the prolonged depolarization (40-s) protocol
and 1 khz for all other protocols. stimulation protocols and
data acquisition were carried out using a microcomputer
(ibm pentium), running commercial software and hardware
(pclamp6.0/ digidata 1200, axon instruments inc. and
scienti®c solutions inc., foster city, ca, u.s.a.) wholecell capacitance was determined from capacitative transient
decay in current recordings following voltage steps of
+10 mv from the holding potential. the median cho-k1
cell capacitance was 47.7 pf (range 11.2 ± 209 pf). at least
80% series resistance compensation was achieved in all
reported experiments (series resistance 13.3+6.4 mo before
compensation). leak subtraction was performed in some
experiments by applying three hyperpolarizing pre-pulses
before the test pulses (p/3 subtraction protocol).

solutions and drugs
the intracellular pipette solution contains (mm): k
gluconate 120, kcl 20, mgatp 1.5, egta 5, n-2hydroxylethylpiperazine-n1-2-ethanesulphonic acid (hepes)

was made as stock solution dissolved in  xxxd102xxx 
(maximum ®nal ethanol concentration =0.1% v v71) and
stored at 748c. in preliminary experiments, we con®rmed
that ethanol at 0.1% v v71 had no eect on the parameters
under study.

statistics
current analyses were performed using the clamp®t module
of pclamp software. data are expressed as mean+s.e.mean
for n experiments. statistical analyses were performed using
prism 2.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a).
unpaired t-tests were used for comparisons of two groups
and repeated measures anova with post-hoc comparison
of means using dunnett's test for multiple group comparisons. a p value 50.05 was considered signi®cant. the
amplitude of the activating current was calculated as the
dierence between the initial current recorded just after the
step depolarization and the maximum reached at the end of
the step. similarly, the amplitude of the tail current was
recorded as the dierence between the peak and steady state
current after repolarization to 760 mv. the voltagedependence of current activation was determined by ®tting
the values of the normalized tail currents to a boltzmann
function:

where i represents the relative tail current, v1/2, the voltage

concentration and current blockade was determined by

post-drug current to control current:

peak tail currents, elicited on repolarization to 760 mv after
3.9-s prepulses from 780 mv to +30 mv, revealed concentration-dependent inhibition by  xxxd2258xxx  with an ic50
value of 196.9 nm (95% ci 151.8 ± 245.8 nm) and hill
coecient 70.96+0.06 (figure 1c. n=5). the blocking eects
of  xxxd2258xxx  was very slow to washout and only slightly
reversible (21.1+6.3% recovery after 20 min, n=7).

results

onset of block

cho-k1 cells transfected with  xxxg1246xxx  possess a potassium
channel with activation and recti®cation properties very
similar to endogenous ikr and also to  xxxg1246xxx -transfected cells
previously described (e.g. human embryonic kidney 293,
snyders & chaudhary, 1996; xenopus oocytes, suessbrich et
al., 1997, cho-k1, walker et al.,1999b). when activated by
step depolarizations, these channels yielded activating outward
currents which decreased in amplitude at potentials positive to
0 mv due to rapid c-type inactivation (smith et al., 1996;
spector et al., 1996). the steady state current-voltage (i-v),
curve has a bell-shaped waveform which peaked at 0 mv. on
repolarization, large tail currents were elicited as a result of
fast relief from inactivation combined with slow deactivation
(sanguinetti et al., 1995). the tail current i-v curve has a
typical sigmoid shape, that is, tail currents increased with
voltage and then reached plateau for membrane potentials
positive to +10 mv.
 xxxd2258xxx  applied to the superfusate blocked both
 xxxg1246xxx  activating and tail currents (figure 1a,b). analysis of

cells were held at 780 mv to keep channels in the closed state
during wash-in of 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx . the solution ¯ow rate
was 1 ml min71 ensuring complete exchange of the bath within
30 s. after 3 min without stimulation, the ®rst 40-s depolarization to 0 mv yielded only a small reduction in activating
current (512%, n=5). however, blockade progressively
increased with subsequent pulses until steady state was reached
after about 6 min (figure 2).

voltage dependence
we studied the voltage-dependence of block by  xxxd2258xxx  by
analysing the eects of the drug on the  xxxg1246xxx  current-voltage
relationship. we ®rst used a standard protocol in which
activating currents were elicited by 3.9-s depolarizing pulses
from a holding potential of 780 mv to potentials between
750 mv and +30 mv. tail currents were elicited by
repolarization to 760 mv (figure 3a, top panel). voltage
steps were delivered at an interpulse interval of 20 s. individual

potocol shown. depolarizing steps 3.9-s in duration were applied from a holding potential of 780 mv, to test potentials from 750
to +30 mv in 10-mv increments. tail currents were generated by repolarization to 760 mv for 10 s. (c)  xxxg1246xxx  tail currents
recorded after repolarization to 760 mv from +30 mv in the presence of varying concentrations of  xxxd2258xxx  were normalized
to the control amplitude (ihalo./ icontrol) and plotted against drug concentration to yield the dose response. a hill equation ®t yielded
an ic50 of 196.9 nm (95% ci: 151.8 ± 245.8 nm) and hill slope of 70.96+0.06 (n=5).

peak tail currents were normalized to the maximal control
amplitude and ®tted with a boltzmann function (figure 3a,

0 mv, 20 s at 760 mv) were then applied at 60-s intervals.

activation (v1/2) was shifted from 717.5+0.4 mv under
control conditions to 723.4+2.5 mv after 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  (p50.05, n=5). the reduction in tail current by 300 nm
 xxxd2258xxx  increased signi®cantly from 24+13% at 730 mv
to 71+6% at +30 mv (p50.05, n=5; figure 3a, bottom
panel).  xxxd2258xxx  therefore exerted a voltage-dependent
block on  xxxg1246xxx . the degree of blockade was more
pronounced with stronger depolarization from 730 mv to
+30 mv as channels were rendered inactivated at positive
potentials. this suggests interaction of  xxxd2258xxx  with the
inactivated state. if so, removal of inactivation might eliminate
the voltage-dependence of channel blockade. to investigate
this, we used a protocol which allowed us to plot an
instantaneous i-v relationship (figure 3b, top panel). cells
were ®rst depolarized to +30 mv for 500 ms to inactivate the
channels. following this, a short 40-ms repolarizing step to
780 mv removed inactivation without allowing sucient time
for deactivation (smith et al., 1996). after this brief
repolarizing step, a series of 1-s test pulses were delivered to
potentials between 7100 mv and +40 mv. currents recorded
at the test pulses were ®tted by single exponential functions
and the peak amplitude obtained was plotted against test
potentials to yield instantaneous i-v curves. with inactivation
removed, the i-v relationship was linear (figure 3b, middle
panel) and  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade was signi®cantly less
(figure 3b, bottom) when compared with the standard i-v
protocol (figure 3a, bottom panel). for example, at +20 mv,
300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  reduced  xxxg1246xxx  currents by 68.1+6.1%

stimulation. current was then activated by 40-s depolarizations to +10 mv. the ®rst pulse after this equilibration period
showed no eect on the initial time course of current activation
and the initial peak current was only reduced slightly
(10+1.9% block, n=5). however, there is a time-dependent
decline in current during the depolarizing step. a single
exponential ®t to this decaying current yielded a time constant
of 16.85+2.07 s (n=5). figure 5b shows the time course of the
`dierence' current obtained by subtraction of the activating
currents (control ±  xxxd2258xxx ). a single exponential ®t to this
`dierence' current yielded a time constant of 14.42+2.31 s
(n=5).

tail currents were recorded at 760 mv after a 500-ms pre-pulse
from 780 mv to +30 mv at 0.1 hz and 0.5 hz. before the ®rst

exchange of the bath.

with the `standard' protocol but only 34.8+8.9% with the
`instantaneous' protocol (p50.05, n=5).

use dependence
to analyse use-dependent block,  xxxg1246xxx  channels were
activated by 500-ms depolarizing steps from 780 mv to
+30 mv at frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5 hz in the presence of
300 nm  xxxd2258xxx . immediately after each step, tail current
amplitudes were measured following repolarization to
760 mv. figure 4 indicates that the time course by which
 xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade occurs is dependent upon the
stimulation frequency (after 150 s, 16.6+3.5% block at
0.1 hz versus 56.4+11.8% block at 0.5 hz, p50.05, n=6).
therefore, block by  xxxd2258xxx  exhibits positive usedependence.

eect of  xxxd2258xxx  during prolonged depolarization
figure 5a shows the eect of  xxxd2258xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  current
amplitude during prolonged depolarizing steps.  xxxd2258xxx ,
300 nm was applied for 3 min to cells held at 780 mv without

development of channel blockade
to further examine the time course of onset of the timedependent block on  xxxg1246xxx , we used an envelope of tails
protocol. peak tail current amplitude was measured after a
series of consecutive depolarizing steps to +30 mv, the
duration of which was progressively increased in 80-ms
increments, followed by a 5-s return to 760 mv to maximize
the tail current (figure 6). this protocol removed inactivation
and allowed us to analyse the eects of  xxxd2258xxx  on the
fully-activated current. figure 6a shows that under control
conditions, with depolarizing steps 5520 ms, peak tail
currents reached steady state, that is,  xxxg1246xxx  channels were
maximally activated. 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  caused a small
reduction (18+0.03%, n=7) in peak tail current after the
®rst (shortest) depolarizing pulse duration of 40 ms (figure
6c). although  xxxg1246xxx  channel activation was maximal after
depolarizations 5520 ms in duration,  xxxg1246xxx  blockade by
300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  continued to increase progressively with
longer depolarizing pulse durations (20+7.6% block after a
120-ms step versus 59.5+4.5% after a 1880-ms step (p50.05,
n=7, figure 6c). therefore the fraction of open channels does
not exclusively determine the degree of blockade. to measure
the onset of the block, currents were normalized to their
maximal amplitude and ®tted with a sum of two exponentials
(figure 6d). with 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx , we obtained values of
164.6+13.4 ms and 455.8+56.1 ms. the control currents
could be well ®tted with a single exponential function with a
time constant of 140.6+3.6 ms.

eect on kinetics
the use-, voltage- and time-dependence of  xxxd2258xxx  block of
 xxxg1246xxx  channel suggest that the drug binds to the inactivated
and/or open states (rampe et al., 1997; toyama et al., 1997;
suessbrich et al., 1997). therefore we studied the eects of
300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  on the time course of activation,
deactivation and inactivation.  xxxd2258xxx  300 nm did not
signi®cantly alter the time course of channel activation or
deactivation at the potentials studied (p=ns, n=4 ± 8, figure 7).
we next studied channel inactivation using a `dual-pulse
protocol'. currents were recorded after a 500-ms depolarization
to +30 mv from a holding potential of -80 mv, followed by a
40-ms hyperpolarizing step to 780 mv to relieve inactivation
without allowing sucient time for deactivation, then a second
depolarization to potentials between 7100 mv and +40 mv
(figure 8b). the time course for the onset of inactivation was
determined by ®tting a single exponential function to the tail
current elicited after the second depolarizing step. in the
presence of  xxxd2258xxx  300 nm, there was a signi®cant
acceleration in the time course for onset of inactivation at most
potentials. at 730 mv, tinactivation was 13.6+1.2 ms under
control conditions versus 10.4+0.3 ms with 300 nm halofanbritish journal of pharmacology, vol 130 (8)

 xxxd2258xxx  there was no signi®cant change in the time constant
of recovery from inactivation (figure 8c). we next looked for
changes in the steady state inactivation of the channels. we used
a double pulse protocol with varying interpulse potential
amplitude, ®rst to inactivate the channels and then to remove
inactivation (figure 8d). the maximal amplitude of the current
during the second pulse to +30 mv represents the number of

channels inactivated during the interpulse . to avoid any
contribution from the capacitance of the cells, current traces
were ®tted in a region where the capacitative artifact had
completely resolved. the capacitative transient was fully
resolved within 3 ms from the beginning of the pulse at all
tested potentials. we then plotted the amplitude of the peak
current against the interpulse potential to obtain the steady state
inactivation (figure 8e). the raw data were ®tted to a boltzmann
distribution and used to calculate the asymptotic value at the
plateau. peak currents were then normalized to this asymptotic
value and the data in figure 8f plotted. averaged mid-activation
potential (v1/2) was shifted 20 mv in the hyperpolarizing
direction by 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx  (v1/2=762+0.4 mv in
controls versus v1/2=782+0.7 mv with 300 nm  xxxd2258xxx ,
p50.05, n=8.). the slope factor was essentially unchanged
(719+0.4 mv for controls versus 721+0.7 mv for  xxxd2258xxx , p=ns, n=8).

discussion
this is the ®rst report of direct blockade of the  xxxg1246xxx  channel
by  xxxd2258xxx , an antimalarial agent in wide clinical use
which has been well documented to cause qt prolongation,
torsades de pointes and fatal cardiac arrests. we found that
 xxxd2258xxx  caused potent inhibition of  xxxg1246xxx  currents with
an ic50 value of 196.9 nm (95% ci 151.8 ± 245.8 nm). the
potency of  xxxd2258xxx  blockade is similar to the methanesulphonanilides which cause block of this channel at
nanomolar concentrations (dofetilide, snyders & chaudhary,

were normalized to the asymptotic value of their respective boltzmann ®t. a boltzmann distribution ®tted to the normalized

1996; e4031, walker et al., 1999b). several other non-cardiac
drugs which prolong qt have also been shown to block
 xxxg1246xxx  or native ikr currents. (e.g. macrolide antibiotics
(daleau et al., 1995; west et al., 1998), haloperidol (suessbrich
et al., 1997), thoridazine (drolet et al., 1999),  xxxd3195xxx 
(rampe et al., 1998), terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx  (suessbrich et al.,
1996),  xxxd1708xxx  (mohammad et al., 1997; rampe et al., 1997;
walker et al., 1999a), ketoconazole (dumaine et al., 1998) and
terodiline (jones et al., 1998).
therapeutic plasma  xxxd2258xxx  concentration in patients
receiving  xxxd2258xxx  treatment is 1.67 to 2.98 mm (veenendaal et al., 1991; karbwang et al., 1991). qt interval has been
shown to be signi®cantly correlated with plasma level of the
parent drug,  xxxd2258xxx , but not with its major metabolite,
n-desbutyl- xxxd2258xxx  (touze et al., 1996). in the report by
nosten et al. (1993), a high dose regimen of  xxxd2258xxx 
(72 mg kg71), induced consistent dose-dependent qt prolongation in all 61 patients treated. our ®nding of a concentration-dependent block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels by  xxxd2258xxx 
therefore correlates well with this observation.
in two cases of serious cardiotoxicity in which plasma
concentration was measured at the time of death or

syncope, it was approximately 1.6 mm in both patients
(nosten et al., 1993). thus,  xxxd2258xxx -induced cardiotoxicity can occur at therapeutic concentrations of the
drug. the ic50 value for  xxxd2258xxx  block of  xxxg1246xxx 
currents is an order of magnitude lower than this
(196.9 nm) but  xxxd2258xxx  is very highly bound in whole
blood (83% to serum proteins, 17% to erythrocytes; cenni
et al., 1995). it is also possible of course, that the potency
of blockade of native human ikr by  xxxd2258xxx  may be
dierent from that of  xxxg1246xxx  currents expressed in
heterologous cell lines.

mechanism of blockade
channel inhibition by  xxxd2258xxx  exhibited time-, voltageand use-dependence, suggesting that it preferentially binds to
open and/or inactivated states of  xxxg1246xxx  channels (rampe et
al., 1997; toyama et al., 1997; suessbrich et al., 1997). we
observed strong evidence for binding of  xxxd2258xxx  to the
inactivated state. thus, block was enhanced by protocols
which render more channels inactivated and weakened by
removal of inactivation.  xxxd2258xxx  increased the rate of

inactivation and caused a marked hyperpolarizing shift in the
v1/2 of steady-state inactivation. this hyperpolarizing shift
re¯ects a reduction in channel availability at a given potential,
and eectively produces enhanced inward recti®cation (smith
et al., 1996).
our data do not exclude the possibility that  xxxd2258xxx 
also interacts with the open-channel state. open-channel
blockers often cause apparent acceleration of the activation
time constant and/or deceleration of the deactivation time
constant due to reopening of channels caused by drug
unbinding (yang et al., 1995; wang et al., 1999). although
 xxxd2258xxx  did not alter activation or deactivation time
constants in our studies, this is not conclusive evidence against
open-state blockade, because drug-induced modi®cation of
deactivation kinetics depends critically on the relative rates of
channel deactivation and drug/channel interaction. for
example, dofetilide blocks  xxxg1246xxx  channels in the open state
but does not change the deactivation time course because it is a
slow-onset/slow-oset open-channel blocker (snyders &
chaudhary, 1996). our results with  xxxd2258xxx  suggest that
binding and unbinding of  xxxd2258xxx  to the open-channel
state occurs slowly for the following reasons: ®rstly, the
envelope of tails test demonstrated that  xxxg1246xxx  channel
blockade by  xxxd2258xxx  increased progressively with increasing depolarizing pulse duration even after steady state
activation had been reached, and secondly, the rate of  xxxg1246xxx 

inhibition of  xxxg1246xxx  by  xxxd2258xxx 

channel deactivation was not aected by  xxxd2258xxx ,
consistent with slow unbinding before channel closing.
a small amount of  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade by  xxxd2258xxx  was observed on the ®rst depolarizing pulse after drug
wash-in at the holding potential. this block, therefore, does
not require previous channel activation, which would suggest
either an initial component of rapid open-channel block or
some small contribution of closed channel block. since taken
collectively, our data do not appear to support rapid openchannel binding, this minor degree of block initially probably
re¯ects a small level of binding to the closed channel state.
in conclusion, we have found that the widely used
antimalarial agent,  xxxd2258xxx , blocks  xxxg1246xxx  potassium
channels. this blockade is the likely underlying cellular
mechanism for qt prolongation and torsades de pointes seen
during therapy with this drug. our data suggest that blockade
of  xxxg1246xxx  by  xxxd2258xxx  is predominantly due to high anity
binding to the open and inactivated channel states, with only a
small contribution from lower anity binding to closed
channels.
