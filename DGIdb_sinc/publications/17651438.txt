serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) belongs to the a-family of
pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate-dependent enzymes and catalyzes the reversible
conversion of  xxxd3193xxx  and tetrahydrofolate to gly and 5,10-methylene
tetrahydrofolate. 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate serves as a source of
one-carbon fragment in many biological processes. shmt also catalyzes
the tetrahydrofolate-independent conversion of l-allo-thr to gly and
acetaldehyde. the crystal structure of bacillus stearothermophilus shmt
(bsshmt) suggested that e53 interacts with the substrate,  xxxd3193xxx  and tetrahydrofolate. to elucidate the role of e53, it was mutated to q and structural and biochemical studies were carried out with the mutant enzyme.
the internal aldimine structure of e53qbsshmt was similar to that of the
wild-type enzyme, except for signiﬁcant changes at q53, y60 and y61. the
carboxyl of gly and side chain of  xxxd3193xxx  were in two conformations in
the respective external aldimine structures. the mutant enzyme was completely inactive for tetrahydrofolate-dependent cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx , whereas
there was a 1.5-fold increase in the rate of tetrahydrofolate-independent
reaction with l-allo-thr. the results obtained from these studies suggest
that e53 plays an essential role in tetrahydrofolate ⁄ 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate binding and in the proper positioning of cb of  xxxd3193xxx  for direct
attack by n5 of tetrahydrofolate. most interestingly, the structure of the
complex obtained by cocrystallization of e53qbsshmt with gly and
5-formyl tetrahydrofolate revealed the gem-diamine form of pyridoxal
5¢-phosphate bound to gly and active site lys. however, density for
5-formyl tetrahydrofolate was not observed. gly carboxylate was in a single conformation, whereas pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate had two distinct conformations. the differences between the structures of this complex and gly
external aldimine suggest that the changes induced by initial binding of
5-formyl tetrahydrofolate are retained even though 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate is absent in the ﬁnal structure. spectral studies carried out with this
mutant enzyme also suggest that 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate binds to the
e53qbsshmt-gly complex forming a quinonoid intermediate and falls off

crystal structure of e53qbsshmt and its complexes

within 4 h of dialysis, leaving behind the mutant enzyme in the gemdiamine form. this is the ﬁrst report to provide direct evidence for enzyme
memory based on the crystal structure of enzyme complexes.

serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) is a member
of the a-family of pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzymes [1]. it catalyzes the reversible interconversion of  xxxd3193xxx  and tetrahydrofolate (thf) to gly
and 5,10-methylene thf (5,10-ch2thf). this compound serves as a key intermediate in the biosynthesis
of methionine, thymidylate, purines, formyl t-rna
and a variety of other end products that require onecarbon fragments for their synthesis [2]. increase in the
activity of shmt along with enhanced dna synthesis
in neoplastic tissues has suggested that shmt might
be a target for cancer chemotherapy [3]. in addition to
its physiological reaction, shmt catalyses the aldol
cleavage of a number of b-hydroxy amino acids such
as  xxxd3361xxx , l-allo-thr, l-threo- and l- xxxd2033xxx -b-phenyl
serine [4–6]. it also catalyzes transamination, racemization and decarboxylation reactions [7].
shmt has been isolated and studied from several
sources. x-ray crystal structures of shmt from
human liver (hc) [8], murine (mc) [9], rabbit liver (rc)
[10], escherichia coli (e) [11] and bacillus stearothermophilus (bs) [12] have been determined. the enzyme
from prokaryotes is a dimer, whereas that from
eukaryotic organisms is a dimer of tight dimers. it was
suggested that shmt cleaves  xxxd3193xxx  to gly and formaldehyde by a retroaldol mechanism, in which the cleavage is initiated by abstraction of the hydroxy proton
of  xxxd3193xxx  by a base at the active site. the formaldehyde
generated interacts with thf to form 5,10-ch2thf,
which is released from the active site. gly dissociates
from the active site in a rate-determining step to complete the catalytic cycle [13]. of the two groups that
could serve as bases for abstracting proton (e53 and
h122 in bsshmt), e53 was present in its protonated
form in the crystal structure, suggesting that it could
not be involved in the proton abstraction step of catalysis [11,12]. mutation of the other residue, h147 in
scshmt corresponding to h122 in bsshmt, led only
to a partial loss of enzyme activity, indicating that it
could not be the residue abstracting the proton [14].
in addition, to abstract the proton from ch2oh
of  xxxd3193xxx , an antiperiplanar geometry of the atoms
involved in the electron movement is required. however, the crystal structure of serine external aldimine of
bsshmt suggests that the geometry is not optimal for
retroaldol cleavage. therefore, a direct transfer mechanism was suggested for the reaction catalyzed by

shmt [12]. this proposal envisages direct nucleophilic
attack on the cb carbon of  xxxd3193xxx  by n5 of thf leading to the formation of a covalent adduct of thf and
serine. in their revised mechanism, szebenyi et al. [15]
also proposed that there is a direct nucleophilic attack
by n5 of thf on cb of  xxxd3193xxx  leading to ca–cb bond
cleavage to form 5,10-ch2thf and glycine bound
anion. it was noted that, in the reverse reaction, the
n5 atom of thf is not optimally positioned for sn2
nucleophilic substitution of the serine hydroxyl. to
resolve these difﬁculties, szebenyi et al. [15] determined
the structures of e75q and e75l mutants of rcshmt
and studied their properties. however, the structures
determined by them were not at high resolution and
suffered from a lack of order in the bound amino acids
[15]. in an effort to resolve this ambiguity, we determined the structure of e53qbsshmt and its binary
complexes with gly,  xxxd3193xxx , l-allo-thr and ternary
complex with gly and 5-formyl-thf (fthf). in
addition, the biochemical and spectral properties of
these complexes were examined. mutation of e53 to q
weakens the binding of thf ⁄ fthf to the gly binary
complex. the results highlight the role of e53 in binding of thf ⁄ fthf and in the proper positioning of
 xxxd3193xxx  for direct attack by n5 of thf.
the structure of e53qbsshmt in the presence of
gly and fthf shows changes in the position of the
active site residues that are reminiscent of fthf
binding to bsshmt even though electron density for
fthf was not traceable. the differences in the structure of the e53qbsshmt-gly binary complex and
the structure obtained in the presence of gly and
fthf provide direct evidence to suggest that the
complex retains the orientation of plp (gem-diamine), which was seen in the crystal structure of
bsshmt-gly-fthf ternary complex even in the
absence of bound fthf [12]. this is an example of
‘enzyme memory’ seen for the ﬁrst time in crystal
structure.

crystal structure of e53qbsshmt and its complexes

fig. 1. conformation of residues y51, e53,
y60, y61 and schiff base (plp covalently
linked to k226) in e53qbsshmt mutant
(yellow) with respect to bsshmt (blue).
y51 and the schiff base are in the same orientation in e53qbsshmt and bsshmt,
whereas the orientations of e53, y60 and
y61 have changed.

wild-type and mutant structures is 0.10 å. the orientation of plp in e53qbsshmt is identical to that of
bsshmt [12]. the most obvious differences are seen
in and around the mutated residue e53. the side chain
of q53 in e53qbsshmt is in a different conformation
compared to that of e53 in bsshmt. changes are
also observed in two adjacent tyr residues 60 and 61.
the plane of phenyl ring of y60 in e53qbsshmt is
almost perpendicular to that observed in bsshmt. in
comparison, the shift is less in the case of y61
(approximately 18) (fig. 1). the absorption spectrum
of e53qbsshmt shows a kmax at 425 nm similar to
that of bsshmt [16].
e53qbsshmt-gly external aldimine
in the gly and ser external aldimine complexes of
e75q and e75lrcshmt, the electron density for
the ligands was not well deﬁned [15]. in contrast, excellent electron density was observed for the ligands
in e53qbsshmt. the gly external aldimine of
e53qbsshmt (e53qbsshmt-gly) shows rmsd
of 0.14 å with respect to gly external aldimine of
bsshmt (bsshmt-gly) considering all ca atoms for
superposition. the side chain conformation of q53 in
e53qbsshmt-gly is only marginally different from
that seen for e53 in bsshmt-gly. unlike in the internal aldimine, smaller differences are observed in the
conformation of the residues y60 and y61. in
bsshmt-gly, the plane of the plp ring is rotated by
24  compared to internal aldimine; an identical change
in orientation of plp was observed in the case of
e53qbsshmt-gly.
4150

the most signiﬁcant difference in the structure is
observed in the case of the bound gly. the carboxylate group of gly is in two distinct conformations in
e53qbsshmt-gly. in one conformation, the carboxylate group forms hydrogen bonds with r357, as in
bsshmt-gly [12]. in the second conformation, the
carboxylate forms hydrogen bonds with ne2 of
q53 (3.34 å) and ne2 of h122 (3.32 å). this second
conformation has an occupancy of 0.4. when the
carboxylate is in the conformation found more predominantly (i.e. towards r357), a water molecule with
an occupancy of 0.6 is present close to the position
corresponding to the second conformation of the
carboxylate group (fig. 2a,b). the hydrogen bonding
between q53 and the second conformation of carboxylate of gly found in e53qbsshmt-gly is less likely
to occur in the wild-type enzyme. the water molecule
with partial occupancy is stabilized by its interaction
with og of s172 (3.2 å) and another water molecule
(2.76 å). apart from the above differences, there is
also a small movement (0.2–0.4 å) of the main chain
in the region 385–394. this region is solvent exposed
and is not near the active site or near the site of
mutation.
e53qbsshmt in presence of gly and fthf
addition of gly to the mutant enzyme showed a small
decrease in the absorption at 425 nm and a corresponding increase at 495 nm, indicating the presence
of small amount of quinonoid intermediate. the formation of the quinonoid intermediate requires abstraction of a proton from the a-carbon atom of the bound

gly. further addition of thf or fthf increased the
absorbance signiﬁcantly at 495 nm and 500 nm,
respectively (fig. 3), suggesting conversion of a signiﬁcant fraction of the enzyme to the quinonoid form. a
similar observation has been made with the wild-type
enzyme [16].
intriguing results are obtained with the structure of
the mutant enzyme determined in the presence of gly
and fthf [e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf)] in the wildtype enzyme, these ligands form a ternary complex
(bsshmt-gly-fthf). in contrast to the orthorhombic space group with a monomer in the asymmetric
unit of bsshmt internal and external aldimines, the
ternary complex crystallizes in a monoclinic cell with
b angle very close to 90 and a dimer in the asymmetric unit due to asymmetric binding of fthf to the
two subunits, which leads to breakdown of the twofold symmetry and hence to the monoclinic crystal
form [12]. attempts to crystallize e53qbsshmt in the
presence of gly and fthf yielded orthorhombic crystals and the density for fthf could not be traced.
plp in this complex was trapped in a gem-diamine
form covalently bonded to both the active site lysine
and the added gly amino group (fig. 4a). gem-diamine

of quinonoid intermediate (–). spectra recorded after (d) 1, (j) 2
and (m) 3 h of dialysis, respectively. a significant decrease was

is an intermediate formed in the interconversion of
the enzyme between internal and external aldimine
forms. the orientation of plp in e53qbsshmtgly(fthf) complex is closer to that of bsshmt-glyfthf than its orientation in the internal or external
aldimine structures of mutant or wild-type enzymes.
this is consistent with the earlier observation that the
orientation of plp in the ternary complex of
mcshmt [9] is similar to the plp in the gem-diamine
form. however, the present structure does not contain
density for fthf. the similarity in the orientation of
plp to that of the wild-type ternary complex [12] and
absence of fthf in the crystal structure suggests that
there is an initial binding of fthf leading to an alteration in the orientation of plp and, subsequently,
fthf falls off from the active site. the differences
between the structures of this complex and gly external aldimine suggest that the changes induced by initial
binding of fthf are retained, even though fthf is
absent from the ﬁnal structure.
another interesting observation in the structure of
e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf) is that the phosphate
group of plp is in two conformations (fig. 4a,b).
the interactions in the ﬁrst conformation are similar
to those described for the bsshmt-gly-fthf [12].
the second conformation is stabilized mainly by
hydrogen bonding to atoms from the symmetry related
subunit. one of the phosphate oxygen atoms in this

conformation is held by hydrogen bonding interaction
with the phenolate oxygen of y51, n of  xxxg257xxx  and
ne2 of q53 of the symmetry related subunit. another
oxygen atom is held by hydrogen bonding to ne2 of
4152

h122 and phenolate oxygen of y51 of the symmetry
related subunit. the third oxygen is hydrogen bonded
to a water molecule and ne2 of h122. the new position of the phosphate group induces a displacement in
y51. as y51 moves to the position occupied earlier by
y61, a corresponding movement is also found in y61
(fig. 4b). in all other complexes of e53qbsshmt,
oh of y51 interacts with op2 of plp (fig. 4b,c). as
the orientation of y51 is different in this complex, a
water molecule compensates for this interaction. there
are also small main chain movements in the regions
83–87, 237–244, 255–258 and 385–394. most of these
regions are solvent exposed and are not directly related
to the active site or site of mutation. the overall structure (other than the changes described above) of
e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf) matches better with
bsshmt-gly (rmsd ¼ 0.15 å) than with the a or b
subunits of bsshmt-gly-fthf with which it has
rmsd of 0.41 and 0.44 å, respectively.
upon the addition of fthf to the binary complex
of e53qbsshmt-gly, the color of the solution changed from yellow to pink, indicating the formation of a
quinonoid intermediate. however by the time crystals
were formed, the color of the drop had turned yellow,
suggesting the conversion of the quinonoid intermediate to other forms of the enzyme. crystallographic
results suggest that the ﬁnal state of the enzyme is
inﬂuenced by the initial binding of fthf and differs
signiﬁcantly from the binary complex formed in the
absence of fthf.
spectroscopic observations also suggest that fthf
dissociates from the enzyme upon prolonged storage
(12 h). the rate of formation of the quinonoid intermediate upon addition of thf to the mutant enzymegly complex was 2.2 s)1 as determined by stopped
ﬂow kinetics, compared to 340 s)1 for bsshmt. it can
be recalled that the formyl oxygen group of fthf
interacts with e53 in bsshmt-gly-fthf ternary
complex [12]. both bsshmt and e53qbsshmt ternary complexes were dialyzed against buffer (50 mm
potassium phosphate ph 7.4 containing 1 mm edta
and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ) devoid of gly and
fthf and spectra were recorded at intervals of 1 h.
signiﬁcant decrease was observed in the quinonoid
intermediate peak (500 nm) with concomitant appearance of a peak at 425 nm (fig. 3) at the end of 4 h,
suggesting that fthf had dissociated from the complex and distribution of the intermediates was altered
in the case of the e53qbsshmt ternary complex. on
the other hand, the bsshmt quinonoid intermediate
peak at 500 nm did not change after dialyzing for 4 h
(fig. 3). plp was estimated in the dialyzed sample and
it was found that the amount (1 mol of plp per mol

of subunit) was the same in both bsshmt and
e53qbsshmt. the dissociation constant (kd) of
fthf for e53qbsshmt-gly was determined from
double reciprocal plots of the change in the absorbance at 500 nm versus fthf concentration at different ﬁxed concentrations of gly. a replot of the
y intercept versus concentration of gly gave the kd
values for fthf. a similar experimental approach
was used to determine the kd in the case of rcshmt
[17]. the kd value for e53qbsshmt-gly was 25 lm
compared to 10 lm for bsshmt-gly. the 2.5-fold
higher kd further suggests that the afﬁnity of
e53qbsshmt-gly for fthf is reduced. although
the density for fthf is not seen in e53qbsshmtgly(fthf), the orientation of plp (gem-diamine
form) in this complex is very similar to that of
wild-type ternary complex [12]. the circular dichroic
(cd) spectrum of e53qbsshmt in the presence of
gly and fthf showed a band at 343 nm (fig. 5),
suggesting the presence of the gem-diamine form
of e53qbsshmt. the crystal structure of e53qgly(fthf) also showed that plp is indeed in the
gem-diamine form and the fthf is not bound
(fig. 4a). this is an interesting case of ‘enzyme memory’. one of the important kinetic evidences for the
occurrence of enzyme memory is the demonstration of
signiﬁcant variation of acceptor double reciprocal
slopes with variation in donor substrate. in the
case of ascorbate oxidase, changes in the slope in
the double reciprocal plot with three different donor
substrate have been used to demonstrate enzyme
memory [18]. in order to show that indeed

the cd spectrum of the ternary complex of the e53qbsshmt has
significant ellipticity at 343 nm, suggesting the presence of gemdiamine (d); ternary complex of bsshmt shows only quinonoid
intermediate (–).

fig. 6. double reciprocal plots for the formation of quinonoid intermediate before and after dialysis of e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf). the
enzyme (1 mgæml)1) was incubated with 10 mm glycine and a varying concentration of fthf (0–400 lm), for 1 min and absorbance at
500 nm was measured. the reciprocal of a500 was plotted against
the reciprocal of fthf concentration (j). the enzyme (10 mg) was
incubated with 10 mm glycine and 500 lm fthf for 5 min and then
dialyzed against buffer d not containing glycine and fthf. such an
enzyme was once again incubated with glycine (10 mm) and different concentrations of fthf as in (j) and the absorbance was measured at 500 nm. the double reciprocal plot (1 ⁄ a versus 1 ⁄ [fthf])
for the dialyzed enzyme is shown (m).

e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf) is kinetically different from
e53qbsshmt-gly, we carried out overnight dialysis
of e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf) against the buffer not
containing glycine and fthf and determined the
slope for the formation of quinonoid intermediate by
the addition of 10 mm glycine and varying fthf concentrations. as shown in fig. 6 the double reciprocal
plot for the formation of quinonoid intermediate as a
function of fthf concentration is different for
e53qbsshmt before and after exposure to glycine
and fthf. the two forms of enzymes bind to fthf
with different slopes (before dialysis )104.4; after dialysis )234.1). in contrast, for bsshmt, slopes were
similar before (21.42) and after dialysis (33.74). if the
lines were parallel then it would suggest that
e53qbsshmt has no enzyme memory and that the
two forms before and after dialysis are kinetically similar. however, because the slopes are drastically different for e53qbsshmt, it suggests that the enzyme
conformation previously exposed to glycine and fthf
is different from that before exposure and that
e53qbsshmt exhibits enzyme memory. the slow
conformational change seen in the e53qbsshmt and
not in the bsshmt enzyme highlights the importance
of glutamate residue in enhanced cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx  in
the presence of thf.

v. rajaram et al.

it is possible to imagine a series of reasonable
atomic movements that account for the observed differences between the complexes of e53qbsshmt-gly
obtained in the absence and presence of fthf. the
carboxylate of gly is in a single conformation in the
wild-type enzyme in which it is hydrogen bonded to
r357. in contrast, in e53qbsshmt, it is partitioned
between two positions that allow hydrogen bonding
with q53 and r357, respectively. upon fthf binding, the gly carboxylate, which is hydrogen bonded
with e53, is in severe short contact with the aldehyde
group of fthf and hence is conﬁned to a single position that allows bonding with only r357, a situation
similar to the wild-type enzyme. to compensate for
the loss of hydrogen bonding interaction with the carboxylate, q53 pulls the phosphate of plp into an
alternate position suitable for bonding. these rearrangements of atoms probably lead to dissociation of
fthf. however, the alternate position occupied by
phosphate does not return to its original position,
probably resulting in plp in the gem-diamine form
(figs 3aand 4a) [19–22].
e53qbsshmt-ser external aldimine
the structure of e53qbsshmt complexed with  xxxd3193xxx 
(e53qbsshmt-ser) shows an rmsd of 0.11 å with
respect to that of bsshmt-ser. the side chain conformations of q53 in the mutant and bsshmt-ser complexes are similar except for oe1 and ne2 atoms. no
signiﬁcant changes in the conformation of residues
y60, y61 and plp orientation are observed in the
mutant with respect to bsshmt-ser. however, the
side chain hydroxyl of bound serine is in two positions. the ﬁrst position is identical to that of
bsshmt-ser complex. in the second position, ser-og
has a weak hydrogen bonding interaction with og of
s172 (3.59 å) and a water molecule (3.46 å). apart
from these changes near the active site, a small movement of the main chain is also observed in some solvent exposed regions such as 83–87 (0.2–0.4 å) and
237–242 (0.4–0.7 å).
attempts to obtain crystals of ternary complex of
bsshmt and e53qbsshmt in the presence of  xxxd3193xxx 
and fthf yielded only crystals of  xxxd3193xxx  external aldimine. earlier attempts to obtain crystals of ternary
complexes of bsshmt and rcshmt were also unsuccessful. the reason for this is thought to be the clash
in the position of -ch2oh of  xxxd3193xxx  and the formyl
group of fthf [12].
mutation of e53 to q led to a complete loss of
thf-dependent cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx . (table 1). km and

determined because the activity was barely measurable
even when the protein concentration was increased by
1000-fold. the direct displacement mechanism for
 xxxd3193xxx  cleavage in the presence of thf envisages simultaneous attack by the n5 of thf on the cb of  xxxd3193xxx 
and a proton transfer to the serine hydroxyl group,
leading to the release of a water molecule. e53 in its
protonated state is ideally situated for proton transfer
because the distance of og of e53 to the oh of  xxxd3193xxx 
is 2.5 å. following this cleavage, gly quinonoid intermediate is formed. the conversion of the gly quinonoid intermediate to the external aldimine involves
another protonation step. the y61 oh group is at a
distance of 2.95 å from the a-carbon atom of gly and
appears to be suitable for this proton transfer. as the
internal and external aldimines of shmts have similar visible absorbance spectrum, cd studies were
carried out to examine the formation of external aldamine. addition of  xxxd3193xxx  causes a signiﬁcant decrease
in the molar ellipticity of bsshmt at 425 nm (fig. 7,

fig. 7. visible cd spectrum of e53qbsshmt with  xxxd3193xxx . the
spectrum was recorded at a protein concentration of 1 mgæml)1
in the range of 300–550 nm (d). further addition of  xxxd3193xxx 
(50 mm) to e53qbsshmt caused a decrease in the ellipticity at
425 nm (–). inset: visible cd spectrum of bsshmt (d) and

inset). on the other hand, addition of  xxxd3193xxx  to
e53qbsshmt (fig. 7) causes only a small change,
suggesting that this external aldimine is spectrally
different from that of the bsshmt-ser complex. this
could be due to subtle changes at the active site environment upon mutation that result in the binding of
serine with its hydroxyl group in two distinct orientations. it was observed that addition of  xxxd3193xxx  to
bsshmt caused an increase in thermal melting
temperature (tm) from 65 to 80 c whereas, with the
mutant enzyme, there was no change (72 c). addition
of gly had no effect on the tm of either bsshmt or
e53qbsshmt. these results suggest that the interactions of  xxxd3193xxx  with bsshmt and e53qbsshmt
are signiﬁcantly different. the results presented so far
suggest that e53 is involved in the proper positioning
of thf ⁄ fthf and the cb carbon of serine,
enabling direct nucleophilic attack in the forward
reaction.
e53qbsshmt and bsshmt in presence
of l-allo-threonine
apart from folate-dependent interconversion of  xxxd3193xxx 
and gly, shmt also catalyses the folate-independent
conversion of l-allo-thr to gly and acetaldehyde.
attempts to crystallize bsshmt and e53qbsshmt in
the presence of l-allo-thr yielded crystals with only
gly bound to plp. this observation suggested that
l-allo-thr was completely cleaved to gly. the density
for acetaldehyde formed in the cleavage was not seen
in the crystal structure. e53qbsshmt-allo-thr and
e53qbsshmt-gly structures superposed with an
rmsd of 0.11 å. in e53qbsshmt-allo-thr also, glycine carboxylate is in two conformations as in
e53qbsshmt-gly. cleavage of l-allo-thr to gly and
acetaldehyde requires several proton transfers. it is
likely that y61, which undergoes large movements
when the enzyme forms complexes with ligands, is
involved in proton abstraction from the allo-thr
and ⁄ or the protonation of glycine quinonoid intermediate to the external aldimine.
the thf-independent activity with l-allo-thr as
substrate increased 1.5-fold upon e53q mutation. it
has been reported that the activity increases by fourfold in the case of e75qrcshmt. the km and speciﬁc
activity values for l-allo-thr with bsshmt were
0.8 mm and 0.65 lmolæmg)1, respectively, and 9.5 mm
and 1.1 lmolæmg)1, respectively, with e53qbsshmt.
the increase in the activity with l-allo-thr is consistent with the observation of only gly bound at the
active site when e53qbsshmt was cocrystallized with
l-allo-thr.

crystal structure of e53qbsshmt and its complexes

conclusions
the direct transfer mechanism envisages a direct attack
of n5 of thf on the cb of  xxxd3193xxx  [12]. the role of
e53 is to position the bound amino acid and thf for
such an attack by suitable interactions with other
active site residues. in addition, e53 also interacts with
the formyl oxygen and n10 of fthf. it is therefore
not surprising that the mutation has affected the
hydrogen-bonding network involving key residues such
as y60 and y61 and the interaction with r357, which
anchors the carboxyl group of the substrate. a consequence of these changes is the complete loss of thfdependent physiological reaction with  xxxd3193xxx . however
thf-independent reaction is not reduced. the loss of
interactions of the glutamate residue with the formyl
oxygen and n10 of fthf in the mutant enzyme
weakens the interactions with thf ⁄ fthf. consequently, although a ternary complex is initially formed,
fthf dissociates and the mutant enzyme crystallizes
in the gem-diamine form. these observations are reminiscent of enzyme memory observed in kinetic experiments with plant aspartate synthase, hexokinase and
ascorbate oxidase [18–20]. the results on the formation
of a quinonoid intermediate and gem-diamine complex
and a slow dissociation of fthf also indicate that
e53qbsshmt exhibits enzyme memory. this is the
ﬁrst instance of such a phenomenon observed in structural studies.

the lowry procedure using bsa as the standard [26].

dna manipulations

crystallization, data collection and processing

plasmids were prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure [24].
preparation of competent cells and transformation were
carried out by the method of alexander [25]. dna fragments were eluted with qia quick gel extraction buffer
(qiagen, valancia, ca, usa).
e53q mutant of bsshmt was constructed using the
primers: e53q (sense) 5¢-caaatacgcgcaaggctat
ccg-3¢ and e53q (antisense) 5¢-cggatagccttgc
gcgtatttg-3¢. the underlined nucleotides deﬁne the
mutation introduced. primers were used on prsh template
to construct the mutant by pcr based sense-antisense primer method [24]. dna sequencing using an abi prism
automated dna sequencer (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca, usa) conﬁrmed presence of the mutation and
showed that no other changes were present.

for the purpose of crystallization, after the ﬁnal ammonium sulfate precipitation, the enzyme was dissolved in
100 mm hepes ph 7.5 with 0.2 mm edta and 5 mm
 xxxd26xxx  and washed with 200 ml of the same
buffer by repeated dilution followed by concentration using
amicon centricon ﬁlters. crystals of e53qbsshmt mutant
were obtained by mixing 4 ll of e53qbsshmt
(18 mgæml)1) and 4 ll of reservoir solution containing
100 mm hepes ph 7.5 with 0.2 mm edta, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx  and 50% 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol. complexes of e53qbsshmt with gly,  xxxd3193xxx , l-allo-thr and
gly and fthf were crystallized using the same condition
with 10 mm of the speciﬁed ligand. these procedures were
identical to those used for the crystallization of bsshmt
and its complexes [12]. for crystallization experiments with
fthf, the enzyme was initially incubated with 2 mm
fthf. the crystals were soaked in the mother liquor for a
few seconds and ﬂash frozen in a stream of nitrogen at
100 k for collecting data. x-ray diffraction data were collected using a rigaku (tokyo, japan) ru-200 rotatinganode x-ray generator (cu-ka radiation) equipped with a
mar research (hamburg, germany) imaging-plate detector system. denzo and scalepack from the hkl2000 suite
(hkl research inc., charlottesville, va, usa) were used
for indexing, integration, data reduction and scaling [27].
crystals of e53qbsshmt and its complexes belonged to
the p21212 space group and contained one monomer in the
asymmetric unit. cell dimensions and details of data collection are shown in table 2.

expression and purification of bsshmt and
e53qbsshmt
the expression and puriﬁcation of the wild-type (bsshmt)
and the mutant enzymes were carried out according to jala
et al. [16]. brieﬂy, prsh-e53q constructs were transformed
into e. coli bl21 (de3) plyss cells. a single colony was
grown at 30 c in 50 ml of lb medium containing
50 lgæml)1 ampicillin. these cells were inoculated into 1 l
of terriﬁc broth containing 50 lgæml)1 ampicillin. after 3–
4 h at 30 c, cells were induced with 0.3 mm iptg for 4–
5 h. the cells were then harvested, resuspended in 60 ml
of buffer a (50 mm potassium phosphate ph 7.4 containing
1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta and 100 lm plp)
and sonicated. the supernatant obtained by centrifugation
at 15 000 g for 30 min (using a sorvall evolutiontm rc
superspeed refrigerated centrifuge with ss-34 rotor, from
thermo fisher scientiﬁc, asheville, nc, usa) was subjected to 0–65% ammonium sulfate precipitation. the pellet
obtained by centrifugation was resuspended in 20–30 ml of
buffer b (20 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 containing
1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta and 50 lm plp)
and dialyzed for 24 h against the same buffer (1 l with two
changes). the dialyzed sample was loaded onto deae-cellulose previously equilibrated with buffer b. the column
was washed with 500 ml of buffer b and the bound protein was eluted with 50 ml of buffer c (200 mm potassium
phosphate ph 6.4 containing 1 mm edta, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 50 lm plp). the eluted protein was precipitated at 65% ammonium sulfate saturation, and the pellet
was resuspended in buffer d (50 mm potassium phosphate
ph 7.4 containing 1 mm edta and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ) and dialyzed against the same buffer (2 l with two
changes) for 24 h. the puriﬁed protein was homogenous

structure solution and model building
the bsshmt crystal structure (1kkj) was used as the
initial model for the reﬁnement of structures of
e53qbsshmt. before initiating the reﬁnement, plp and
water molecules were removed from the model. the model
was then subjected to rigid body reﬁnement followed by
restrained reﬁnement using refmac5 from the ccp4 suite
[28]. five percent of unique reﬂections were used to monitor the progress of reﬁnement by rfree. visualization of the
electron density map and model ﬁtting were peformed using
coot [29]. structure was validated using procheck [30].
figures were generated using the program pymol [31].
for the complexes of e53qbsshmt with gly,  xxxd3193xxx  and
l-allo-thr, bsshmt-gly external aldimine crystal structure
(1kl1) was used as the initial model. the models of
e53qbsshmt–ligand complexes were further reﬁned in
the same manner as described above. align was used for the
superposition of structures [32]. differences between the
structures were detected visually and by calculating distances

the details of the reﬁnement statistics and quality of the
reﬁned structure are given in table 3. the fo–fc annealed
omit map was calculated using the cns reﬁnement program
[33] with a spherical omit region of 5 å around plp for
e53qbsshmt-gly and e53qbsshmt-gly(fthf).

enzyme assays
thf-dependent cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx  to gly was monitored
using l-[3)14c]-ser and thf as substrates [34]. thf-independent aldol cleavage of l-allo-thr to gly and acetaldehyde was measured by estimating (at 340 nm) the rate of
nadh-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol and
nad+ catalyzed by  xxxg110xxx  present in an
excess amount in the reaction mixture [4]. the nadh consumed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of 6220 m)1æcm)1. the kinetic constants
were calculated using double reciprocal plots. one unit of

incubated with 10 mm glycine and different concentrations
of fthf (0–400 lm) for 1 min and absorbance was measured at 500 nm. the reciprocal of a500 was plotted against
the corresponding reciprocal of fthf concentration [18].
the kd of fthf for bsshmt-gly and e53qbsshmtgly was determined from double reciprocal plots of the
change in a500 versus fthf concentration at different
ﬁxed concentrations of gly. a replot of the y-intercept
versus concentration of gly gave the kd values for fthf.
a similar experimental approach was used to determine the
kd in the case of rcshmt [17,35].

cd spectra
cd measurements were made using a jasco (tokyo, japan)
j-500 a automated recording spectropolarimeter. spectra
were collected at a scan speed of 20 nm per min and a
response time of 16 s. the cd spectra obtained were plotted as molar ellipticity (hme) assuming  xxxg220xxx  mw of
45 kda for the enzyme.
hme ¼ ðh  100  mwþ=cd
where h ¼ observed ellipticity (), c ¼ concentration of
protein in mgæml)1 and d ¼ path length in decimeter
(0.01 nm). visible cd spectra were recorded from 500–
300 nm using 1 mgæml)1 protein in the presence of  xxxd3193xxx ,
gly, thf and fthf.

stopped-flow spectrophotometry
the presteady state kinetics of wild-type and the mutant
enzymes with gly or gly and thf ⁄ fthf were monitored
using a sx.18mv-r stopped-ﬂow spectrophotometer
(applied photophysics ltd., leatherhead, uk) with a path
length of 2 mm and a pressure of 125 psi (compressed
nitrogen). the dead time of the instrument was 10 ms.
all experiments were performed in 50 mm potassium
phosphate ph 7.4 containing 1 mm edta and 1 mm
 xxxd26xxx . single wavelength stopped-ﬂow kinetic
measurements were performed at 25 c maintained by a
circulating water bath. the components were mixed using
two syringes, one containing the enzyme (500 lm) and the
other containing gly (100 mm) or gly and thf (70 lm) or
gly and fthf (200 lm). the contents were mixed and the
reaction was initiated. single wavelength data were collected at different time regimes. for each data set, 1000
data points were collected. all experiments were repeated at
least three times. the data were analyzed using sx.18mvr, version 4.42 [36,37].

estimation of plp at the active site
the enzyme (1 mgæml)1) was incubated with 0.1 m naoh
for 5 min and the absorption spectra were recorded in the

4158

range 300–550 nm. the plp content was determined by
using a molar absorption coefﬁcient value for plp
(6600 m)1æcm)1 at 388 nm).

thermal denaturation studies
the thermal denaturation of bsshmt and the
e53qbsshmt in the absence and presence of ligands, such
as  xxxd3193xxx  and gly were carried out by measuring the absorbance changes at 287 nm in a jasco v-530 uv-vis spectrophotometer. the protein (300 ll of 0.3 mg), with or
without the ligand, was taken, with appropriate blanks, in
thermal quartz cuvettes and equilibrated at 30 c to obtain
the baseline. the samples were heated from 30 c to 90 c
at the rate of 1 cæmin)1 using a programmable thermal
control unit. the absorbance change in each case was monitored at 287 nm and the values were averaged from two
independent experiments. the ﬁrst derivative of the denaturation proﬁle was used to evaluate the apparent tm using
the software supplied with the instrument. the results were
analyzed according to the method of white and olsen [38]
in which the fraction of the protein in the denatured state
(fd) is given by:
fd ¼ at  an =ad  an
where an is the absorbance of the protein sample at 30 c,
ad is the absorbance of the sample at 80 c and at is the
absorbance of the protein sample at different temperatures
between 30 c and 80 c. the apparent tm was deﬁned as
the temperature at which the value of fd was 0.5.
