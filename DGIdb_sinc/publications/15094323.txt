abstract
the present study set out to investigate the pharmacological profile of the cardiovascular responses
induced by the  xxxd2022xxx  agent,  xxxd2395xxx , in pithed rats. for this purpose, intravenous (i.v.)
administration of blocking doses of the antagonists  xxxd3000xxx  (a1; 100 ag/kg), rauwolscine (a2; 300 ag/kg),
the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg) plus rauwolscine (300 ag/kg), propranolol (h; 1000 ag/kg),
ritanserin (5-ht2; 100 ag/kg) or equivalent volumes of saline (1 ml/kg) were used.  xxxd2395xxx  (0.03, 0.1,
0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure which
were highly reproducible as they remained unaltered after saline. these tachycardic responses to
 xxxd2395xxx  remained unaffected after  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine, ritanserin or the combination  xxxd3000xxx  plus
rauwolscine, but were abolished after propranolol. in contrast, the  xxxd2395xxx -induced vasopressor
responses were not significantly modified after the above doses of rauwolscine, ritanserin or propranolol, but
were markedly blocked after  xxxd3000xxx  or the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus rauwolscine; the latter blockade
did not significantly differ from that produced by  xxxd3000xxx  alone. interestingly, in rats pretreated
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with reserpine (5 mg/kg;
24 h),  xxxd2395xxx -induced tachycardic responses were
abolished whereas the corresponding vasopressor responses were markedly attenuated and subsequently
blocked by  xxxd3000xxx . it is concluded that  xxxd2395xxx -induced tachycardic responses seem to involve only
an indirect (tyramine-like action) mechanism mediated by h-adrenoceptors, whilst the corresponding

introduction
it is well known that, depending on the a- or h-adrenoceptor type involved, sympathomimetic agents
may induce: 1) a cardiac excitatory action, responsible for the increase in heart rate and force of
contraction; 2) peripheral excitatory actions on certain types of smooth muscle, such as those in blood
vessels (vasoconstriction); and 3) peripheral inhibitory (relaxant) actions on other types of smooth
muscle, such as those in the gut, bladder or gallbladder (hoffman, 2003).
 xxxd2395xxx  ( xxxd2395xxx , methyl-iso-octenylamine) is a sympathomimetic drug that was introduced into
clinical practice long ago for the treatment of spastic conditions of the biliary (gullo et al., 1985) and
urinary (pennington, 1945) tracts. interestingly,  xxxd2395xxx  is also employed in the treatment of
migraine (young, 1966; diamond and medina, 1975; diamond, 1976; repschlaeger and mcpherson,
1984; solomon, 1995; raskin and baringer, 1996; freitag et al., 2001). it has been suggested that this
drug owes its  xxxd2022xxx  action to a sympathomimetic effect leading to cranial vasoconstriction (ryan,
1974; spierings and saxena, 1980). indeed, our group has shown (willems et al., 2001b) that
intracarotid infusions of  xxxd2395xxx  induce vasoconstriction in the canine external carotid circulation
by two mechanisms: i) a direct mechanism involving rauwolscine-sensitive a2-adrenoceptors; and ii) an
indirect (tyramine-like action) mechanism, involving the displacement of catecholamines (i.e. noradrenaline) from sympathetic nerves.
on this basis it is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of other indirect sympathomimetic agents
(broadley, 1996), the intravenous (i.v.) administration of  xxxd2395xxx  should induce a tyramine-like
action which, in turn, would result in tachycardic (via h-adrenoceptors) and vasopressor (via aadrenoceptors) responses. however, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported. therefore,
this study set out to investigate the pharmacological profile of the cardiovascular (tachycardic and
vasopressor) responses to i.v.  xxxd2395xxx  in pithed rats, with particular emphasis on verifying the
potential role of those monoamines receptors producing tachycardic and/or vasopressor responses in this
preparation (centurión et al., 2002; de luca and rand, 1988; wilffert et al., 1982), namely: (i) hadrenoceptors (with propranolol); (ii) a1- and a2-adrenoceptors (with, respectively,  xxxd3000xxx  and
rauwolscine); (iii) 5-ht2 receptors (with ritanserin); and (iv) indirect (tyramine-like action) mechanisms
(with reserpine).

methods
animals
male wistar normotensive rats (250–300 g) were used at 12–14 weeks of age. the animals
were maintained at a 12 h light-dark cycle. the rats were kept in a special room at constant

3225

temperature (22 f 2jc) and humidity (50%), with food and water freely available in their
home cages.
general methods
experiments were carried out in a total of 56 rats which were initially divided into three groups (n =
29, 16 and 11 respectively). the first group received no treatment (untreated group). the second group
was systematically pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) 24 hr before the start of the
experiments (reserpinised group) to eliminate the tyramine-like action exerted by  xxxd2395xxx . the
third group was pretreated with equivalent volumes of the corresponding vehicle (5% w/v  xxxd228xxx ,
i.p.) following the same schedule (sham group).
after anaesthesia with ether and cannulation of the trachea, all rats were pithed by inserting a stainless
steel rod through the orbit and foramen magnum into the vertebral foramen (shipley and tilden, 1947).
the animals were artificially ventilated with room air using an ideal palmer pump (56 strokes/min;
stroke volume of 20 ml/kg), as previously established by kleinman and radford (1964). after bilateral
vagotomy, catheters were placed in the right femoral vein, for the administration of: antagonists,
 xxxd2395xxx  and tyramine, and the left carotid artery, connected to a statham pressure transducer (p23
id), for the recording of arterial blood pressure; heart rate was measured with a tachograph (7p4f, grass
instrument co., quincy, ma, usa) triggered from the blood pressure signal. both heart rate and blood
pressure were recorded simultaneously by a model 7d grass polygraph (grass instrument co., quincy,
ma, usa) (see centurión et al., 2002).
experimental protocol
after a stable haemodynamic condition for at least 30 min, baseline values of heart rate and
diastolic blood pressure (a more accurate indicator of peripheral vascular tone/resistance than mean
blood pressure) were determined. then, the first group (untreated; n = 29) received consecutive i.v.
bolus injections of  xxxd2395xxx  (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, given sequentially). then, this
group was subdivided into 6 subgroups that received i.v. bolus injections of, respectively: (i)
physiological saline (1 ml/kg, n = 5); (ii)  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg, n = 6); (iii) rauwolscine (300 ag/kg, n
= 4); (iv) the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg) plus rauwolscine (300 ag/kg) (n = 6); (v)
ritanserin (100 ag/kg; n = 4); and (vi) propranolol (1000 ag/kg; n = 4). subsequently, the responses
to the above doses of  xxxd2395xxx  were reanalyzed 15 min after administration of the aforementioned compounds.
furthermore, the second (reserpinised) group (n = 16) was subdivided into two subgroups. the first
subgroup (n = 10) received i.v. bolus injections of  xxxd2395xxx  (0.03–3 mg/kg) as previously
described and was subsequently subdivided into 2 sets which received i.v. bolus injections of,
respectively: (i) physiological saline (1 ml/kg, n = 5); or (ii)  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg, n = 5). after 15
min, the responses to the above doses of  xxxd2395xxx  were re-analysed. the second subgroup (n =
6) received consecutive i.v. bolus injections of tyramine (10, 18, 31, 56, 100 and 180 ag/kg, given
sequentially).
finally, the third group (sham; n = 11), pretreated with the vehicle of reserpine (5%  xxxd228xxx 
given i.p.), was subdivided into two subgroups receiving i.v. bolus injections of either  xxxd2395xxx 
(0.03–3 mg/kg; n = 5) or tyramine (10–180 ag/kg; n = 6) as previously described.

the dose-intervals between the different doses of  xxxd2395xxx  and tyramine ranged between 5 and 15
min, as in each case we waited until the heart rate and diastolic blood pressure had returned to baseline
values. for physiological saline or the antagonists (administered in a total volume of 1 ml/kg), a period of
15 min was allowed to elapse before the dose-response curves to  xxxd2395xxx  were elicited again. the
dosing with  xxxd2395xxx  and tyramine was sequential. the ethical committee of the department of
pharmacobiology (cinvestav-ipn) dealing with the use of animals in scientific experiments approved
the protocols of the present investigation.
data presentation and statistical analysis
all data in the text and figures are presented as mean f s.e. mean. the peak changes in heart rate and
diastolic blood pressure elicited by  xxxd2395xxx  or tyramine were determined. the difference between
the tachycardic and vasopressor responses to  xxxd2395xxx  within one group/subgroup of animals as well
as between two groups (i.e.  xxxd2395xxx  or tyramine in reserpine- and vehicle-pretreated animals) was
evaluated with student-newman-keuls’ test, once a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
(randomized block design) had revealed that the samples represented different populations. finally, the
baseline values of heart rate and diastolic blood pressure before and after saline or the antagonists were
compared by using student’s paired t-test. statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05 (two-tailed)
(steel and torrie, 1980).
drugs
apart from the anaesthetic ( xxxd2052xxx ), the drugs used in the present study (obtained from the sources
indicated) were:  xxxd2395xxx  (carnrick laboratories, cedar knolls, nj, usa);  xxxd3001xxx 
(bufa chemie b.v., castricum, the netherlands); rauwolscine hydrochloride and ritanserin (research
biochemicals int., natick, ma, usa); propranolol hydrochloride, reserpine and tyramine hydrochloride
(sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa). all compounds were dissolved in physiological saline with
the exception of reserpine, which was dissolved in 5% (w/v)  xxxd228xxx . a short period of heating was
needed to dissolve  xxxd3000xxx . these vehicles had no effect on baseline diastolic blood pressure or heart rate
(not shown). the doses mentioned in the text refer to the free base of substances in all cases.

results
systemic haemodynamic variables before and after the different treatments
the baseline values of heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in the rats without reserpine (group 1 and 3,
n = 40) were, respectively, 283 f 8 beats/min and 49 f 2 mmhg. these variables did not significantly
differ (p > 0.05) from those obtained in the animals pretreated with reserpine, i.e. 274 f 15 beats/min and
45 f 3 mmhg (n = 16). as shown in table 1, these haemodynamic variables remained essentially
unchanged (p > 0.05) after (15 min) i.v. saline,  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine, the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus
rauwolscine, ritanserin or propranolol.
effects of saline or some antagonists on  xxxd2395xxx -induced tachycardic responses
i.v. administration of  xxxd2395xxx  produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate (fig. 1). no
evidence of tachyphylaxis was observed, as these responses remained essentially unchanged in

control animals receiving i.v. saline (1 ml/kg; fig. 1a). this result also indicates that no timedependent changes occurred during the experimental period (240 min) in our animal model.
furthermore, these tachycardic responses remained unchanged after blocking doses of  xxxd3000xxx  (100
ag/kg; fig. 1b), rauwolscine (300 ag/kg; fig. 1c), the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus rauwolscine
(100 ag/kg and 300 ag/kg, respectively; fig. 1d) or ritanserin (100 ag/kg; fig. 1e). in contrast,
propranolol, in a dose sufficient to completely block h-adrenoceptors (1000 ag/kg; wilffert et al.,
1982), abolished (p < 0.05 when compared to the respective controls) the tachycardic responses to
 xxxd2395xxx  (fig. 1f).

the doses and time intervals used, were reproducible and remained essentially unchanged (p >
0.05) in control animals receiving saline (1 ml/kg; see fig. 2a). likewise, the vasopressor
responses to  xxxd2395xxx  remained without significant changes (p > 0.05) after rauwolscine
(300 ag/kg; fig. 2c), ritanserin (100 ag/kg; fig. 2e) or propranolol (1000 ag/kg; fig. 2f), but were
markedly blocked after  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg; fig. 2b) or the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus
rauwolscine (100 ag/kg and 300 ag/kg, respectively; fig. 2d) at doses that selectively block
vascular a1- and a2-adrenoceptors (willems et al., 2001a). it is noteworthy that the blockade
produced by the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus rauwolscine (fig. 2d) did not significantly differ
from that produced by  xxxd3000xxx  alone (fig. 2b).

cardiovascular effects of  xxxd2395xxx  in the rats pretreated with vehicle or reserpine
as shown in fig. 3 (upper panel), in the animals pretreated with vehicle (5% w/v  xxxd228xxx ),
 xxxd2395xxx  elicited dose-dependent increases in heart rate (figs. 3a and 3b). in contrast, in the
animals pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg),  xxxd2395xxx -induced tachycardic responses were
abolished (p < 0.05 when compared to the respective controls) (fig. 3a) and the subsequent
administration of saline produced no further effect (fig. 3a). similar effects of  xxxd2395xxx  were
observed in other reserpine-pretreated animals by the subsequent administration of  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/
kg; fig. 3b).
moreover, fig. 3 (lower panel) shows that in the animals pretreated with vehicle (5% w/v
 xxxd228xxx ),  xxxd2395xxx  induced dose-dependent increases in diastolic blood pressure (figs. 3c
and 3d). these  xxxd2395xxx -induced vasopressor responses were significantly attenuated (but not
abolished) in the animals pretreated with reserpine (fig. 3c), and the subsequent administration of
saline produced no further effect. interestingly, in other animals pretreated with reserpine, the
attenuated vasopressor responses to  xxxd2395xxx  underwent a further blockade by the subsequent
administration of  xxxd3000xxx  (100 ag/kg) (fig. 3d).
cardiovascular effects of tyramine in the rats pretreated with vehicle or reserpine
it is important to emphasise that the pretreatment schedule with reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p., 24
h before the start of the experiments) or its corresponding vehicle used in the present study was
validated by investigating the effects of the indirect sympathomimetic agent, tyramine (10–180
ag/kg) under these experimental conditions. as shown in fig. 4, in the animals pretreated with
vehicle (5% w/v  xxxd228xxx ), tyramine induced dose-dependent increases in heart rate (fig. 4a)
and diastolic blood pressure (fig. 4b). these tyramine-induced tachycardic and vasopressor

responses were abolished (p < 0.05 when compared to the respective controls) in the animals
pretreated with reserpine (see figs. 4a and 4b, respectively).

discussion
general
taking into account the drawbacks associated with the use of ergots, attempts have been made to
explore other avenues for the acute treatment of migraine. in this respect,  xxxd2395xxx  is a non-ergot
vasoconstrictor agent effective in the treatment of migraine either alone or in combination with
acetaminophen and dichloralphenazone (midrinr) (diamond and medina, 1975; diamond, 1976). in
keeping with its  xxxd2022xxx  action,  xxxd2395xxx  causes vasoconstriction in the arteriovenous
anastomoses of anaesthetised cats (spierings and saxena, 1980) and in the external carotid circulation
of anaesthetised dogs (willems et al., 2001b), experimental models predictive of  xxxd2022xxx  activity
(see de vries et al., 1999; villalón et al., 1999). although these findings certainly reinforce the view that
the acute  xxxd2022xxx  efficacy of  xxxd2395xxx  is due to a sympathomimetic action leading to cranial
vasoconstriction, no formal studies have comprehensively evaluated its systemic cardiovascular effects
in animal models. thus, this study was designed to investigate whether the i.v. administration of
 xxxd2395xxx  produces increases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in pithed rats and to elucidate
the mechanisms involved. apart from the implications discussed below, the major findings of the present
study are that i.v.  xxxd2395xxx  induces: (i) tachycardic responses, which seem to involve only an
indirect (tyramine-like action) mechanism mediated by the release of catecholamines and the subsequent
stimulation of cardiac h-adrenoceptors; and (ii) vasopressor responses mediated by a predominantly
indirect (tyramine-like action), as well as a minor direct (a1-adrenoceptors), sympathomimetic
mechanism.
systemic haemodynamic changes
as previously described, i.v. saline or the antagonists  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine, ritanserin or propranolol
failed to significantly modify the baseline values of heart rate and diastolic blood pressure (table 1).
therefore, the effect of a given antagonist on the cardiovascular responses to  xxxd2395xxx  ought to be
explained in terms of a direct interaction of the antagonist with its corresponding receptor rather than by
a change in baseline systemic haemodynamic values.
involvement of b-adrenoceptors in the tachycardic responses to  xxxd2395xxx 
since the tachycardic responses to  xxxd2395xxx  were abolished after propranolol or reserpine, an
indirect mechanism mediated by h-adrenoceptors is involved. that is why we did not investigate the
effects of propranolol in reserpinised animals. thus,  xxxd2395xxx  seems to exert its tachycardic
responses by displacing noradrenaline from the corresponding sympathetic nerves. within this context, it
is well known that the release of endogenous noradrenaline increases heart rate predominantly via
stimulation of h1-adrenoceptors (terzic et al., 1993; brodde and michel, 1999). interestingly, it has also
been shown in pithed rats pretreated with propranolol that noradrenaline released by cardiac sympathetic

3232

l.f. valdivia et al. / life sciences 74 (2004) 3223–3234

nerve stimulation or displaced by tyramine acts on a1-adrenoceptors to produce tachycardic responses
(rand et al., 1986; de luca and rand, 1988). in contrast, our results (figs. 1b and 1c) showing the lack
of blockade of  xxxd3000xxx  (a1) or rauwolscine (a2) on the tachycardia to  xxxd2395xxx  apparently exclude
the involvement of a-adrenoceptors under our experimental conditions. this is in keeping with our
findings showing no increases in heart rate after administration of blocking doses of propranolol (fig.
1f). therefore, the present study seems to be one of the first to show comprehensively in vivo the
functional role of cardiac h-adrenoceptors in the indirect tachycardic responses to  xxxd2395xxx  in
pithed rats.
to the best of our knowledge, other lines of evidence reporting the h-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic
activity of  xxxd2395xxx  are those describing relaxation of the gallbladder; this activity was useful in the
treatment of spastic conditions of the biliary tract (ryan, 1981).
involvement of a1-adrenoceptors in the vasopressor responses to  xxxd2395xxx 
in view that the  xxxd2395xxx -induced vasopressor responses remained unchanged after i.v. saline,
rauwolscine, ritanserin or propranolol, but were markedly blocked after  xxxd3000xxx , a predominant
involvement of a1-adrenoceptors (rather than a2-adrenoceptors or 5-ht2 receptors) is established.
consistent with this view, the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  plus rauwolscine produced a blockade of the
vasopressor responses to  xxxd2395xxx  that did not significantly differ (p > 0.05) from that produced by
 xxxd3000xxx  alone. it is important to emphasise that the doses of  xxxd3000xxx  and rauwolscine (willems et al.,
2001a) as well as ritanserin (centurión et al., 2002) and propranolol (wilffert et al., 1982) used in this
study were high enough to completely block their respective receptors mediating cardiovascular
responses. moreover, the fact that reserpine markedly blocked (but did not abolish) the vasopressor
responses to  xxxd2395xxx , which were subsequently attenuated by  xxxd3000xxx , indicates that a
predominantly indirect (tyramine-like), as well as a minor direct (a1-adrenoceptor), sympathomimetic
mechanism is involved. hence, the failure of rauwolscine to block the vasopressor responses to
 xxxd2395xxx  would suggest that the role of a2-adrenoceptors (if any) is rather limited. contrasting
with these findings, the canine external carotid vasoconstrictor responses to  xxxd2395xxx  are mainly
mediated by a2- rather than a1-adrenoceptors (willems et al., 2001b). this apparent discrepancy may be
explained by differences in: (1) species; and (2) density and distribution of the different a-adrenoceptor
subtypes in conductance and resistance blood vessels. likewise, the systemic vascular resistance,
represented by diastolic blood pressure, is predominantly modulated by a1-adrenoceptors (vargas and
gorman, 1995). in this respect, it is noteworthy that the vasopressor responses to exogenous
noradrenaline (i.v.) in pithed rats are mediated by both a1- (blocked by  xxxd3000xxx ) and a2- (blocked
by rauwolscine) adrenoceptors (data not shown). however, it should be kept in mind that neuronallydisplaced noradrenaline (i.e. by an indirect sympathomimetic mechanism) mainly stimulates vascular a1adrenoceptors (located intrasynaptically), whilst systemically-administered noradrenaline predominantly
stimulates vascular a2-adrenoceptors (located extrasynaptically) (ruffolo, 1985). this can account for
the above actions of  xxxd2395xxx .
validation of the dose-schedule employed with reserpine
it is important to highlight that the dose-schedule of reserpine employed in the present study (5 mg/
kg, i.p.-24 hrs) is sufficient to abolish the tachycardic and vasopressor responses to the classical indirect

sympathomimetic amine, tyramine (fig. 4). with these findings, one can reiterate that  xxxd2395xxx 
produces: (i) increases in heart rate via a tyramine-like action; and (ii) increases in blood pressure via a
predominantly indirect (tyramine-like), as well as a minor direct (a1-adrenoceptor), sympathomimetic
mechanism.
possible implications
taking into account its sympathomimetic properties (particularly vasoconstriction in the external
carotid bed),  xxxd2395xxx  has been employed in the acute treatment of migraine. admittedly, some
unpleasant side effects of  xxxd2395xxx  in long treatment could be explained by its capability to induce
systemic cardiovascular effects (as shown in the present study). certainly, the chronic use of
 xxxd2395xxx  in migraine may result in cardiovascular changes including palpitation (macneal and
david, 1947) and increased blood pressure (raroque et al., 1993). fortunately, it is also reported that in
low doses it only causes selective cranial vasoconstriction before producing any effect on blood pressure
(ryan, 1974). in any case, the suitability of  xxxd2395xxx  in the acute treatment of migraine falls
beyond the scope of the present work. obviously, further studies will be required to document and
evaluate this issue.

conclusion
our results show that i.v.  xxxd2395xxx  elicits: (i) increases in heart rate via an indirect (tyramine-like
action) mechanism; and (ii) increases in blood pressure via a predominantly indirect (tyramine-like
action), as well as a minor direct (a1-adrenoceptor), sympathomimetic mechanism.
