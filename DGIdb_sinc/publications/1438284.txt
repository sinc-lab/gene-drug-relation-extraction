abstract
torpedo acetyicholinesterase (acchoease, ec
3.1.1.7) and human butyrylcholnesterase (btchoease, ec
3.1.1.8), while clearly differing in substrate specificity and
sensitivity to inhibitors, possess 53% sequence homology; this
permitted modeling human btchoease on the basis of the
three-dimensional structure of torpedo acchoease. the modeled btchoease structure closely resembled that of acchoease
in overall features. however, six conserved aromatic residues
that line the active-site gorge, which is a prominent feature of the
acchoease structure, are absent in btchoease. modeling
showed that two such residues, phe-288 and phe-290, replaced
by leucine and valine, respectively, in btchoease, may prevent
entrance of butyrylcholine into the acyl-binding pocket. their
mutation to leucine and valine in acchoease, by site-directed
mutagenesis, produced a double mutant that hydrolyzed butyrylthiocholine almost as well as acetylthiocholine. the mutated
enzyme was also inhibited well by the bulky, btchoeaseselective organophosphate inhibitor (tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, iso-ompa). trp-279, at the entrance of the activesite gorge in acchoease, is absent in btchoease. modeling
designated it as part of the "peripheral" anionic site, which is
lacking in btchoease. the mutant w279a displayed strongly
reduced inhibition by the peripheral site-specific ligand  xxxd3027xxx  relative to wild-type torpedo acchoease, whereas inhibition by the catalytic-site inhibitor  xxxd1968xxx  was unaffected.
in vertebrates, two enzymes efficiently catalyze acetylcholine (accho) hydrolysis: acetylcholinesterase (acchoease;
 xxxg38xxx ) and  xxxg248xxx  (btchoease; ec
3.1.1.8) (1). the principal role of acchoease is termination
of impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses (2). although
btchoease is widely distributed, its biological role is unknown (3); it is so called because it hydrolyzes butyrylcholine
(btcho) at rates similar to or faster than accho, whereas
acchoease hydrolyzes btcho much more slowly (4). btchoease is also known as serum cholinesterase, due to its high
concentration in vertebrate serum (3). the two enzymes are
further distinguished by their different susceptibility to various inhibitors (5). for example, some bisquaternary compounds, which are more potent inhibitors of acchoease than
their monoquaternary counterparts, bind poorly to btchoease (6). human btchoease (h-btchoease) is of interest to
anesthesiologists and geneticists because it is responsible for
breakdown ofthe short-term muscle relaxant succinylcholine
(7) and because numerous genetic variants exist in which the
rate of succinylcholine hydrolysis is reduced (8).
cloning and sequencing reveal striking sequence homology
between acchoease and btchoease (1, 8-11). there is 53%
identity and 73% similarity between h-btchoease and the
phylogenetically distant torpedo acchoease (t-acchoease). the three intrachain disulfides are conserved (12, 13),
and no deletions or insertions occur in the first 535 amino

acids, including all those involved in catalytic activity. this
marked structural similarity encouraged us to use the threedimensional structure of t-acchoease (14) to model h-btchoease. we hoped, thereby, to gain an understanding of
how structural differences between the two might account for
known differences in specificity and, also, to attempt to
confer btcho-hydrolyzing activity upon acchoease by limited site-directed mutagenesis.
materials and methods
materials. tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (iso-ompa),
bw284c51, acetylthiocholine iodide, butyrylthiocholine iodide, acetylcholine chloride, and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide were from
sigma;  xxxd1968xxx  chloride was from hoffmann-la
roche; and [3h]acetylcholine iodide (90 mci/mm; 1 ci = 37
gbq) was from nen (paris).
model building. modeling was done interactively with
frodo (15, 16) on an evans and sutherland ps390 graphics
system to convert the amino acid sequence of t-acchoease
to that of h-btchoease. the h-btchoease structure was
energy-minimized by the simulated hybridizing program
x-plor (17) with the positional refinement option.
site-directed mutagenesis. a pef-bos vector, containing
an insert encoding the h catalytic subunit of torpedo marmorata acchoease (18), was introduced into escherichia
coli strain rz 1032 to obtain uracil-containing template dna
(19). single-stranded dna was produced from the phagemid
(20). the oligonucleotide, 5'-gaaggaaaccctgatac-3'
was used to make the double mutant f288l-f290v, and
5'-gacattcgcctccacgt-3' was used to produce mutant w279a. synthesis and ligation were achieved with t4
dna polymerase and t4 dna ligase in the same tube after
hybridizing 1.5 pmol of 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotide
with 0.05 pmol of template. e. coli strain tg1 was transformed with the resulting double-stranded dna. the coding
region of a clone that presented the correct mutation was fully
sequenced. dna was purified by two cscl gradients and
transfected into cos-7 cells, as described (18).
cholinesterase assays. cholinesterase activity was determined radiometrically on [3h]accho (21) or spectrophotometrically (22) with either acetylthiocholine or butyrylthiocholine.
active-site titration. concentration of acchoease active
sites in cos cell extracts was determined with the organo-

phosphate o-ethyl-s2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphothionate (mpt) as titrant (23).

results and discussion
residues 4-534 of t-acchoease can be aligned with residues
2-532 of h-btchoease (10) with 53% identity and no deletions
or additions (fig. 1). the catalytic triad residues are in the same
abbreviations: accho, acetylcholine; acchoease, acetylcholinesterase; btcho, butyrylcholine; btchoease,  xxxg248xxx ;
h-btchoease, human btchoease; t-acchoease, torpedo acchoease; iso-ompa, tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide. single-letter
amino acid code is used; substitutions are indicated by original amino
acid, position number, and substituted amino acid.

positions (ser-200, glu-327, and his44o in t-acchoease) as
are the intrachain disulfides (12, 13). in the following, amino
acid numbers will correspond to the numbering for t-acchoease. computer modeling was done with the t-acchoease
sequence and three-dimensional structure, whereas sitedirected mutagenesis used t. marmorata acchoease. the two
acchoease sequences differ by only 10 amino acids (11), none
of which appear pertinent to their differences in activity.
modeling of h-btchoease. the starting model for h-btchoease was the refined 2.8-a x-ray t-acchoease structure (14)
[brookhaven access code lace (24)]. in this structure, all
residues except 1-3, 485-489, and 535-537 were seen, although 81 atoms in the side chains of some surface polar
residues were not visible. to obtain the h-btchoease model,
all residues in the t-acchoease sequence differing from
those of h-btchoease were changed accordingly. in h-btchoease 356 side chains are either identical to those of
t-acchoease or have the same number of dihedral angles.
the initial h-btchoease model retained the experimentally
determined torsion angles for these side chains. an additional
83 residues, with fewer side-chain torsion angles in h-btchoease than in t-acchoease, were also allowed to retain the
experimental x-ray torsion angles of t-acchoease. the
dihedral angles of 87 residues with longer side chains in
h-btchoease than in t-acchoease were fixed to their most
frequently found torsion angle values (25). in only 13 cases,
where the most common rotamer of a side chain overlapped
with neighboring atoms, the second most common rotamer
was taken. energy minimization was achieved after 110
cycles of positional refinement. at that stage the ca rms
deviation between t-acchoease and the h-btchoease
model was 0.28 a. the largest shift, 1.4 a, was displayed by
a534m, the last c-terminal residue seen in the x-ray structure; the second largest shift, 0.9 a, was seen in h159p, a
surface residue. positions of the catalytic triad residues s200,
e327, and h440 showed very small shifts (ca shifts of 0.1,
0.1, and 0.14 a, respectively).
in the t-acchoease structure, the catalytic triad is located
near the bottom of an -20-a deep narrow cavity, which we
named the aromatic gorge because -40%o of its surface area
is lined with the rings of 14 aromatic amino acids (14). all
these residues are fully conserved in the five known vertebrate acchoease sequences (10, 11), except for one case in
which phenylalanine is replaced by tyrosine. this result
suggests that these aromatic rings are important in acchoease function. indeed, there is strong evidence that phe-330
and trp-84, which are near the catalytic triad, are directly
involved in binding the quaternary group of accho (14, 26)
(see below). the role of other aromatic residues, more distal
from the active site, remains to be clarified; we have suggested that some may facilitate catalysis by providing low-

residues 4-534, which are seen
in the x-ray structure of t-acchoease, are compared. reverse type indicates identical
residues, whereas grey boxes indicate similar residues (i.e., a

affinity binding sites both for accho and for the choline
produced by enzymic activity (14). although as many as 30
residues contribute, to some extent, to the gorge lining in the
t-acchoease structure, comparison of t-acchoease and
h-btchoease sequences, as well as other known acchoease
and btchoease sequences (27-32), shows that only 10 amino
acids that have side chains facing the gorge differ in btchoease (table 1, fig. 2). four ofthese changes are probably not
associated with differences in enzymic properties of the two
enzymes because they involve substitution by residues with
similar side chains-i.e., v71i, s122t, l282v, and s286t.
the other six cases all involve substitution of an aromatic
residue in acchoease by a nonaromatic residue in btchoease-namely, y70n, y121q, w279a, f288l, f290v, and
f/y330a (see fig. 3).
substrate fitting. we previously suggested a plausible
model for docking of accho, in an all-trans configuration,
within the active site of t-acchoease (14). in this model, the
acetyl group of accho was positioned to make a tetrahedral
bond with ser-200 oy. this resulted in the positively charged
quaternary group of the choline moiety being within van der
waals distance (=3.5 a) of trp-84, earlier suggested by
affinity labeling to be within the "anionic" site (26). this
assignment is confirmed by the structures of two acchoease-inhibitor complexes with the anionic-site-directed
competitive inhibitors tacrine and  xxxd1968xxx , which we
have recently determined (m.h., i.s., and j.l.s., unpublished work). in the h-btchoease model, trp-84, like the
catalytic triad, does not move relative to its position in
t-acchoease (ca shift of 0.07 a). hence we can model a
bound btcho molecule in the same orientation as accho.
when we thus try to model btcho in the active site of

fig. 2. stereo view of the 14 aromatic residues, the side chains of which face the active-site gorge, and a modeled bound btcho molecule.
t-acchoease is shown in yellow; h-btchoease is shown in blue.

acchoease, the bulkier butyryl moiety of btcho clearly
cannot fit into the "esteratic" locus: two residues, phe-288
and phe-290, are seen to be near the modeled acetyl moiety
of the bound accho molecule (see fig. 4a). in the h-btchoease model, however, substantial reduction in size of the side
chains of the corresponding residues, leu-288 and val-290,
permits the butyryl group to fit into the larger esteratic pocket
of the model (see fig. 4b).
butyrylthiocholine hydrolysis by a f288l-f290v double
mutant. prediction of the theoretical docking procedure was

tested experimentally by generating a double mutant, f288lf290v, of t-acchoease, which was expressed in cos cells.
active-site titration with the organophosphate o-ethyl-s2diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphothionate (23) showed
that the double mutant retained --10 of the specific activity
of the wild type toward accho. comparison of its activity
toward butyrylthiocholine and acetylthiocholine (table 2)
showed that it hydrolyzed the butyryl ester at a substantial
rate compared with the acetyl ester, whereas no detectable
activity on butyrylthiocholine was displayed by wild-type
t-acchoease. thus, removal of the bulky phenyl rings of
f288 and f290 appears, as predicted, to permit btcho to
enter the active site readily and to be hydrolyzed efficiently.
the organophosphate iso-ompa, which contains four
isopropyl groups, is a selective inhibitor of btchoease,
inhibiting acchoease much more slowly than btchoease
from the same species (5). although iso-ompa is a rather
poor inhibitor of wild-type acchoease, it inhibits the f288lf290v mutant much more effectively (table 3). presumably
the double mutation provides space for entrance of the bulky
organophosphate inhibitor, just as for btcho.
mutation involving the peripheral anionic site. two other
changes involving substitution of aromatic by nonaromatic
residues are of amino acids the aromatic side chains of which
undergo localized conformational changes upon binding of
the competitive inhibitors tacrine and  xxxd1968xxx , as
shown by our crystallographic data (m.h., 1.s., and j.l.s.,
unpublished work). these changes are in trp-279 and phe330. phe-330 is near the ligand-binding site, and in both
complexes, the conformational change seen involves an
aromatic-aromatic or an aromatic-quaternary nitrogen interaction with the bound ligand (m. verdonk, private communication). trp-279 is, however, at least 8 a away from the
"anionic" site; any direct contact with a small inhibitor
bound can thus be precluded. bisquaternary ligands, such as
 xxxd1820xxx  (33), are more potent inhibitors of acchoease than the corresponding monoquaternary ligands; this
has been ascribed to their binding simultaneously to the
anionic subsite of the catalytic site and to the "peripheral"
anionic site (6). binding studies of several series of n-alkyl
bisammonium ions (34, 35) have shown an optimal separation
of 14-15 a between the two quaternary groups, whereas the
distance between the two indole moieties of trp-84 and
trp-279 is 16 a in acchoease. these data can be rationalized by assuming that trp-279, at the mouth of the
active-site gorge, is an important component of the peripheral
anionic site. our recent study of the complex of t-acchoe-

explain its lack of a peripheral site and, thus, its failure to
display enhanced sensitivity to bisquaternary inhibitors.
the mutation w279a was designed and expressed to test the
above hypothesis. active-site titration shows that it retains
-80% of the specific activity of wild-type acchoease toward
accho. fig. 5a shows that inhibition of w279a by  xxxd1968xxx , which binds specifically to the anionic subsite of the
catalytic site, is similar to that of the wild type. in contrast,
inhibition by the peripheral-site ligand  xxxd3027xxx  is reduced at
least 10-fold (fig. sb). the inhibitory capacity of the bisquaternary inhibitor bw284c51, which is believed to span the two
sites, is reduced (fig. sc) but far less than that of  xxxd3027xxx .
acchoease is inhibited by excess accho, whereas btchoease is not (4). recent evidence (36) suggests that the peripheral anionic site and the accho-binding site involved in
substrate inhibition may be identical. measurement of the
degree of substrate inhibition obtained for w279a at 50 mm
acetylthiocholine showed, however, only slightly less substrate inhibition than for the wild type (30%o versus 40%o),
relative to the activity seen at 1.2 mm substrate. it should be
borne in mind that btchoease displays substrate inhibition
with benzoylcholine (37) and that the mutation of glu-199,
adjacent to ser-200, abolishes substrate inhibition in t-accho-

10831

ease (38). thus the molecular basis for substrate inhibition in
both acchoease and btchoease remains to be clarified.
the studies outlined above show that, for the pair of
enzymes under consideration, modeling was of powerful
predictive capacity. following the predictions, it was possible to convert acchoease to a btcho-hydrolyzing enzyme
and to strongly reduce the affinity of a peripheral ligandbinding site that is absent in btchoease.
