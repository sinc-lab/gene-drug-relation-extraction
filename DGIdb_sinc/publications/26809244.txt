ó springer international publishing switzerland 2016

abstract  xxxd1980xxx  (emplicititm) is a humanised igg1
monoclonal antibody developed by bristol-myers squibb
(bms) and abbvie that has been approved as combination
therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the us.
 xxxd1980xxx  binds to the cell surface receptor signalling
lymphocytic activation molecule f7 ( xxxg2077xxx ), which is
selectively expressed on myeloma cells and natural killer
cells, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
and direct natural killer cell activation. in a phase iii
clinical trial, addition of  xxxd1980xxx  to lenalidomide and
dexamethasone therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory
multiple myeloma was associated with a significant
improvement in progression-free survival and overall
response rate. this article summarizes the milestones in the
development of  xxxd1980xxx  leading to this first approval
for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

1 introduction
bristol-myers squibb (bms) and abbvie are developing
 xxxd1980xxx  (emplicititm), a humanized igg1 monoclonal
antibody that binds to the cell surface receptor  xxxg2077xxx 
[signalling lymphocytic activation molecule f7, also
known as cs1,  xxxg2077xxx  and cd2-like receptor activating
cytotoxic cells ( xxxg2077xxx )], for the treatment of multiple
myeloma [1, 2].  xxxg2077xxx  is highly expressed on multiple
myeloma cells, although its expression in other normal
cells and tissues is restricted to certain leukocytes,
including natural killer (nk) cells, making the receptor an
appealing target for anti-myeloma therapy [2]. in
november 2015,  xxxd1980xxx  was approved in the usa
for use in combination with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple
myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies
(dosage: 10 mg/kg given intravenously weekly for 2
cycles then biweekly thereafter) [3, 4]. the european
medical agency’s committee for medicinal products for
human use (chmp) has granted accelerated assessment
for  xxxd1980xxx  as part of combination treatment for
multiple myeloma in patients who have received one or
more prior therapies [5].

1.1 company agreements
in august 2008, pdl biopharma (now abbvie) and bms
entered into a worldwide co-development and commercialization agreement for  xxxd1980xxx . under the terms of
this agreement bms provided an upfront payment of
$us30 million for the development and marketing rights to
 xxxd1980xxx . abbvie is eligible for milestone payments of
up to $us480 million and up to $us200 million in royalties. the companies agreed to share development costs,
with bms leading global development and providing 80 %
of the funding and abbvie contributing the remainder.
profits on sales in the usa are to be shared between the
two companies and abbvie will receive royalties from
sales outside the usa [6].

2 scientific summary
2.1 pharmacodynamics
in vitro,  xxxd1980xxx  inhibited the binding of multiple
myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells (indicating
potential for disrupting adhesion-mediated mechanisms of
drug resistance [7]) and demonstrated  xxxg2077xxx -specific
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) in multiple myeloma cells (including cells resistant to

bortezomib) in a dose-dependent manner [1]. pre-treatment
with dexamethasone, bortezomib and lenalidomide significantly enhanced  xxxd1980xxx -induced lysis of multiple
myeloma cells [1]. results of a further series of in vitro
studies indicate that, in addition to inducing adcc,  xxxd1980xxx  may induce nk-cell activation by binding to
 xxxg2077xxx  on nk cells [8].
in vivo,  xxxd1980xxx  induced significant tumour regression in  xxxg2077xxx -positive (l363, opm2, and mm1s)
murine xenograft models of human multiple myeloma, with
l363 tumours eradicated in 2 of 10 mice, opm2 tumours in
5 of 9 and mm1s tumours in 2 of 8 [1]. in a model of the
human bone microenvironment, primary myeloma cells
were injected into human foetal bones engrafted in scid
mice. a significant reduction in tumour volume and circulating  xxxd2207xxx  levels was observed in mice treated with
 xxxd1980xxx  compared with a control monoclonal antibody.
pre-treatment with bortezomib significantly enhanced  xxxd1980xxx -mediated adcc in opm2 tumours and the
 xxxg2077xxx -positive cell line xg-1, but not the slamf7negative and bortezomib-resistant cell line rpmi8226/r5.
patient-derived nk cells induced &20 % specific lysis of
autologous myeloma cells when  xxxd1980xxx  10 lg/ml was
present, and addition of bortezomib increased this specific
lysis in a dose-dependent manner. addition of  xxxd1980xxx 
to bortezomib significantly enhanced antimyeloma activity
in the opm2 xenograft model [9].

 xxxd1980xxx : first global approval

2.2 pharmacokinetics
 xxxd1980xxx  exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, suggesting target-mediated clearance. administration of intravenous  xxxd1980xxx  at the recommended dosage of 10 mg/kg
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is
predicted to result in a geometric mean steady-state trough
concentration of 194 lg/ml [4].
geometric mean clearance of  xxxd1980xxx  decreased with
increasing doses, from 17.5 ml/day/kg at a dose of 0.5 mg/
kg to 5.8 ml/day/kg at a dose of 20 mg/kg (twice the recommended dose). a population pharmacokinetic model
predicted elimination of &97 % of the maximum steadystate concentration in 82.4 (geometric mean) days when
 xxxd1980xxx  is given in combination with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone [4].

with that of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone alone
(n = 325) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
myeloma [11]. treatment was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal.
patients had received one to four prior therapies (median
two), including bortezomib (70 % of patients),  xxxd2562xxx 
(65 %), thalidomide (48 %) and lenalidomide (6 %).
at an interim analysis of this trial (median follow-up
24.5 months), 35 % of  xxxd1980xxx , lenalidomide and
dexamethasone recipients remained on therapy compared
with 20 % of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone recipients
[11]. the primary reason for discontinuation was disease
progression (42 and 46 %, respectively). median progression free survival (pfs) was 19.4 months in  xxxd1980xxx 
plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone recipients versus
14.9 months in lenalidomide plus dexamethasone recipi-

control regimen recipients died (data not yet mature).

2.3 therapeutic trials

2.3.1.2 phase ii various doses of  xxxd1980xxx  in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone have been
evaluated in a phase i/ii study (nct00742560) in patients
with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [12]. in the
phase ii component of the study, patients were randomized
to  xxxd1980xxx  10 (n = 36) or 20 (n = 37) mg/kg for a
median of 22 and 16 28-day treatment cycles, respectively.
 xxxd1980xxx  was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
during cycles 1 and 2, and on days 1 and 15 for subsequent
cycles. oral lenalidomide 25 mg was administered on days
1–21 and dexamethasone was given at a dose of 28 mg

weekly for 2 cycles then biweekly) in combination with
lenalidomide (25 mg on days 1–21) plus oral dexamethasone
(40 mg/week orally, or 28 mg/week orally and 8 mg
intravenously on  xxxd1980xxx  dosing weeks) [n = 321]

a. markham

orally plus 8 mg intravenously on  xxxd1980xxx  dosing days,
or 40 mg once weekly. the orr was 92 and 76 % in the
10 and 20 mg/kg dosage cohorts, respectively (84 % for
the two groups combined). overall, stringent complete
response/complete response was observed in 14 % of
patients, a very good partial response in 42 % and partial
response in 27 %. in the 10 and 20 mg/kg groups, the
median time to objective response was 1.0 and 1.7 months
and median pfs was 32 and 25 months. treatment discontinuation occurred in 60 patients; 57 % as a result of
disease progression, 20 % because of adverse events and
23 % for other reasons [12].
a phase ii study has compared the combination of
 xxxd1980xxx , bortezomib and dexamethasone with that of
bortezomib plus dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/
refractory multiple myeloma (nct01478048, ca204009). treatment was administered in 21-day cycles for 8
cycles and 28-day cycles thereafter.  xxxd1980xxx  was given
at a dosage of 10 mg/kg once weekly during cycles 1 and
2, on days 1 and 11 during cycles 3–8 and on days 1 and 15
thereafter. bortezomib was given at a dosage of 1.3 mg/m2
intravenously/subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 during cycles 1–8 and on days 1, 8, and 15 thereafter; oral
dexamethasone was given at a dose of 20 mg on nonelotuzumab days and an oral dose of 8 mg plus 8 mg
intravenously on  xxxd1980xxx  days.  xxxd1980xxx , bortezomib and dexamethasone recipients received a median of
12 treatment cycles compared with 7 in bortezomib plus
dexamethasone recipients; the primary reason for discontinuation was disease progression (52%). one and two-year
pfs rates were 39 and 24 %, respectively, in  xxxd1980xxx ,
bortezomib and dexamethasone recipients (n = 77) compared with 32 and 6 % in bortezomib plus dexamethasone
recipients (n = 75). median pfs was 9.7 months in
 xxxd1980xxx , bortezomib and dexamethasone recipients versus 6.9 months in bortezomib plus dexamethasone recipients. the orr was 66 and 63 %, respectively [13, 14].
the effectiveness of adding  xxxd1980xxx  to thalidomide
plus dexamethasone treatment for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma has also been assessed in a phase ii
study (ca204-010, nct01632150). patients (n = 40)
received treatment in 28-day cycles; during cycles 1 and 2
 xxxd1980xxx  10 mg/kg was administered on days 1, 8, 15,
and 22, with a dose escalation of oral thalidomide from
50–200 mg/day. from cycle 3,  xxxd1980xxx  was given
biweekly on days 1 and 15. oral dexamethasone was
administered at a dose of 40 mg once weekly.
cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day could be added for patients
who did not achieve at least a partial response by cycle 5 or
progressed between cycles 2 and 5. patients had received
1–8 prior therapies; 60, 55 and 35 % were refractory or
intolerant to prior bortezomib, lenalidomide or both,
respectively. the duration of treatment was 0.1–15

(median 4) months, with a clinical benefit rate of 58 %,
including nine partial, four very good partial, two complete
and one stringent complete response. of those patients with
a partial response or better, 63 % continued to respond at 1
year [15].
2.3.1.3 phase i in a phase i study, patients with multiple
myeloma who had received a median of two prior therapies
were treated with ascending doses of  xxxd1980xxx  plus
bortezomib. treatment was administered in 21-day cycles
using a 3 ? 3 dose escalation design.  xxxd1980xxx  2.5, 5.0,
10 mg/kg (n = 3 per dose) or 20 mg/kg (n = 19) was
given on days 1 and 11 and intravenous bortezomib
1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. thirteen of 27 evaluable
patients (48 %)—including two of three refractory to
bortezomib—achieved a partial response or better. a minor
response or better was achieved in 63 % of patients.
median time to progression was 9.46 months [16].
2.4 adverse events
in eloquent-2, adverse events (all grades) with a
c10 % incidence in  xxxd1980xxx  recipients overall
(n = 318), and a c5 % greater incidence in  xxxd1980xxx 
than in lenalidomide and dexamethasone recipients
(n = 317) included fatigue (61.6 vs. 51.7 %), diarrhoea
(46.9 vs. 36.0 %), pyrexia (37.4 vs. 24.6 %), constipation
(35.5 vs. 27.1 %), cough (34.3 vs. 18.9 %), peripheral
neuropathy (26.7 vs. 20.8 %), nasopharyngitis (24.5 vs.
19.2 %), upper respiratory tract infection (22.6 vs. 17.4 %),
decreased appetite (20.8 vs. 12.6 %), pneumonia (20.1 vs.
14.2 %), pain in extremities (16.4 vs. 10.1 %), headache
(15.4 vs. 7.6 %), vomiting (14.5 vs. 8.8 %), weight
decreased (13.8 vs. 6.0 %), lymphopenia (13.2 vs. 6.9 %),
cataracts (11.9 vs. 6.3 %) and oropharyngeal pain (10.1 vs.
4.4 %). other adverse events that occurred at a frequency
of c5 % in  xxxd1980xxx  recipients and at least twice the
rate in the control group included chest pain, hypersensitivity, hypoesthesia, mood altered, and night sweats [4].
laboratory abnormalities that worsened from baseline
and occurred with a c10 % incidence in  xxxd1980xxx  recipients and a c5 % higher incidence than in lenalidomide and
dexamethasone recipients in this trial included all grade
thrombocytopenia (83.6 vs. 77.8 %), hypoalbuminaemia
(73.3 vs. 65.6 %), elevated alkaline phosphatase (38.7 vs.
29.8 %), low bicarbonate levels (62.9 vs. 45.1 %) and
hyperkalaemia (32.1 vs 22.2 %), as well as grade 3/4 lymphopenia (76.7 vs. 48.7 %), leukopenia (32.4 vs. 25.6 %),
hyperglycaemia (17.0 vs. 10.2 %), hypocalcaemia (11.3 vs.
4.7 %) and hyperkalaemia (6.6 vs. 1.6 %) [4].
serious adverse reactions in eloquent-2 were
reported in 65.4 % of  xxxd1980xxx  recipients compared with
56.5 % of lenalidomide and dexamethasone recipients,

 xxxd1980xxx : first global approval

most frequently pneumonia (15.4 vs 11 %), pyrexia (6.9 vs
4.7 %), respiratory tract infection (3.1 vs 1.3 %), anaemia
(2.8 vs 1.9 %), pulmonary embolism (3.1 vs 2.5 %) and
acute renal failure (2.5 vs 1.9 %). six percent of  xxxd1980xxx  recipients discontinued treatment because of
adverse effects compared with 6.3 % of lenalidomide and
dexamethasone recipients [4].
initial safety data available from the phase i portion
(n = 6 evaluable) of a phase i/ii trial in patients with
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (nct01668719,
swog 51211) determined the maximum tolerated
 xxxd1980xxx  dose to be 10 mg/kg in this setting [17]. the
adverse events that occurred most frequently included
fatigue (100 %), oedema (83 %) and peripheral neuropathy
(83 %), with the latter also being the most common grade
3/4 adverse event (33 %) [17, 18]. during this phase i
period, patients received 8 cycles of induction therapy
(each comprising subcutaneous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2

days 1, 4, 8, and 11, oral dexamethasone 20 mg days 1, 2,
4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 and oral lenalidomide 25 mg days
1–14, and taken with  xxxd1980xxx  10 mg/kg days 1, 8, and
15 of cycles 1–2 and days 1 and 11 of cycles 3–8) followed
by maintenance treatment (subcutaneous bortezomib
1.0 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15, oral dexamethasone 20 mg
days 1, 8, and 15, oral lenalidomide 15 mg days 1–21 plus
 xxxd1980xxx  10 mg/kg days 1 and 15).
across four clinical trials of  xxxd1980xxx , 72 of the
390 patients (18.5 %) evaluable for the presence of
anti-product antibodies tested positive for treatmentemergent anti-product antibodies, according to an
electrochemiluminescent assay. anti-product antibodies
occurred within the first 2 months of treatment in 63
patients (88 %) and resolved by 2–4 months in 49 of
these (78 %). neutralizing antibodies were detected in
19 of 299 patients in the randomized trial in multiple
myeloma [4].
