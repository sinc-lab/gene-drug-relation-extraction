abstract evidence exists that m analgesics such as
morphine, methadone and fentanyl may act through
distinct m opioid receptor mechanisms. it has been
proposed that the functional diversity of m opioid
receptors may be related to alternative splicing of the
 xxxg1635xxx  gene. although a number of m opioid receptor
mrna splice variants have been reported, their biological relevance has been controversial, due in part to their
very low abundance and a general lack of validation from
independent laboratories. we have identified 11 of 17
proposed exons as well as the majority of exon combinations used to make 21 differentially spliced  xxxg1635xxx 
mrnas from mouse whole brain cdna, using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) conditions different from those
used by the single other group that has reported multiple
splice forms. alternative splicing was shown to occur at
both the 50 and 30 termini. moreover, verification of a
short variant, containing exons 1 and 4 only, suggests
that splicing also occurs directly between 50 and 30 exons.
notably, a novel splice variant, mor-1t, demonstrates
for the first time that exon 4 can be used in combination
with further downstream exons to make the 30-end of
 xxxg1635xxx  splice variants. the putative protein encoded by
mor-1t is predicted to be identical to that of  xxxg1635xxx ,
implying that the  xxxg1635xxx  protein can be generated from
at least five differentially spliced mrnas. our results
support the view that the  xxxg1635xxx  gene undergoes extensive
alternative splicing, as a likely major contributor to the
diversity of m opioid receptors.

introduction
the  xxxg1635xxx  gene is the only gene known to encode a m
opioid receptor [1, 2, 3]. however, pharmacological
studies have indicated the presence of multiple m opioid
receptor subtypes [4, 5, 6], and molecular approaches
suggest that these may be generated from the same gene
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. after the molecular cloning of
a d opioid receptor ( xxxg1632xxx ) [15], a m opioid receptor
mrna ( xxxg1635xxx ), consisting of four exons, was identified
[16, 17, 18]. subsequently, alternatively spliced variants
of the m opioid receptor were identified in human and rat
tissues [7, 19], and eventually in murine tissue [11, 12].
these variants share exons 1, 2 and 3, which encode all
seven transmembrane domains characteristic of g-protein
coupled receptors, whereas substitution of exon 4 with
alternative 30 exons, or an extended exon 3, results in
subtypes of the receptor differing in their intracellular
carboxyl termini. variants alternatively spliced at the 50
terminus were described with the detection of exons 11–
14 [13]. in contrast with the formerly described variants,
whose promoter is located upstream of exon 1, the
expression of these variants is under the control of a
promoter located upstream of exon 11. transcripts
initiated at the latter promoter encode a protein similar
to  xxxg1635xxx , truncated proteins with six transmembrane
domains, or short truncated proteins with no transmembrane domains. furthermore, three new exons located
between exon 3 and exon 5 were recently identified by
g.w. pasternak and colleagues (genbank accessions
af346812, af346813 and af346814). substitution of
exon 4 in  xxxg1635xxx  with either one of these exons creates
new splice variants.
there has been some controversy in the literature
regarding the biological significance of  xxxg1635xxx  splice
variants. gaveriaux-ruff and kieffer hypothesize that
other mechanisms, such as changes in protein conformation rather than alternative splicing, cause the functional
diversity of m opioid receptors [20]. there is however
some evidence that different splice variants are coupled to
different functions. 30 terminus splicing of both the rat and
mouse m opioid receptor influences agonist-mediated internalization and receptor resensitization [21, 22]. m opioid ligands show significant binding differences among
splice variants, and their regional expression patterns
vary considerably [11, 12, 23, 24, 25, 26]. moreover,
antisense targeting of  xxxg1635xxx  exons has suggested that
different splice variants are responsible for morphine- and
morphine-6-glucuronide mediated analgesia [8, 9, 10].
the current model suggests that the  xxxg1635xxx  gene
contains at least 17 exons and spans more than 250 kb
of genomic dna. our current knowledge owes much to
the efforts of one research group, and no validation of this
complex splicing pattern has been reported in independent
studies. the fact that no sequence information is presently
available for m opioid receptor splice variants from mouse
expressed sequence tags (est) entries in genbank
suggests that the abundance of the splice variants may
be very low. therefore, the objective of this study was to

investigate the occurrence of reported  xxxg1635xxx  splice
variants in mouse whole brain cdna, and to search for
possible additional splice variants.

materials and methods
firstchoice pcr-ready mouse brain cdna (ambion europe,
cambridgeshire, uk) was used in the polymerase chain reaction
(pcr). high quality poly(a)+ rna was used in the first-strand
cdna synthesis to maximize the yield of full-length cdna, and
was carefully checked for ribosomal rna and genomic dna
contamination. pcr primers were designed from known sequences
( xxxg1635xxx  [16, 17, 18], mor-1a–mor-1n [7, 11, 12, 13] and
mor-1p–mor-1r [genbank accessions af346812, af346813
and af346814]) to allow amplification of each of the 17 proposed
exons. notably, these primers were different from those used in
previous studies reporting multiple  xxxg1635xxx  splice forms [7, 11, 12,
13]. the sequences of the oligonucleotides and the sources from
which they were designed are given in table 1. a lightcycler
system (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany) with the
lightcycler-faststart dna master sybr green i kit (roche)
was employed for pcr amplifications. extension times for the
different pcr runs were calculated from the expected fragment
lengths, and opening annealing temperatures were based on the
melting temperatures (tm) of the primers, determined with the
2(a+t)+4(g+c) method. however, the optimal annealing temperature could differ somewhat from the calculated tm . the exact
cycling conditions and the primers used for each pcr are available
on request. in general, the outer sets of forward and reverse primers
were used in the first-round pcr. for most reactions, pcr products
were visible on agarose gels only after the second round of pcr
amplification using a nested pair of primers (middle or inner,
table 1). prior to dna sequencing, pcr products were purified
using the qiaquick pcr purification kit, or recovered from
agarose gels using the qiaquick gel extraction kit (qiagen,
hilden, germany). for dna sequencing, a perkin-elmer geneamp pcr system 9700 (perkin-elmer, foster city, calif.) and
the abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit (perkin-elmer) were employed. sequences were
analyzed on an applied biosystems 377 dna sequencer.

results
the complex structure of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene is outlined in
fig. 1. to explore for  xxxg1635xxx  splice variants, pcrs were
performed using mouse whole brain cdna as the target
source with primers derived from each of the 17 proposed
exons. all reactions were carried out with forward and
reverse primers derived from separate exons to control for
possible genomic dna contamination. splice variants in
which exon 4 has been replaced with alternative 30 exons
(mor-1bi, -bii, -c, -d, -e, -f, -m, -n, -p, -q, -r in
fig. 1) were detected in pcr amplifications with forward
primers from exon 3 along with reverse primers from
exons 5, 6–10, or 15–17. except for the 30 exons reported
for mor-1b (exon 5), mor-1q (exon 16) and mor-1r
(exon 17), all other proposed 30 exons and exon combinations were detected and verified by dna sequencing.
representative examples of amplified products are shown
in fig. 2 (lanes 2–5). notably, exon 10, which is present
in mor-1f, was only detected in combination with exon
3, whereas we failed to amplify the combination of exon
10 with further downstream exons (exons 6–9). interest-

ingly, using forward primers from exon 3 along with
reverse primers from exon 7, we identified a novel splice
variant, mor-1t (figs. 1, 2, lane 9) [genbank accession
ay358080], in which a consensus splice donor site in
exon 4 allows the first 302 nucleotides of exon 4 (termed
exon 4a in fig. 1) to be spliced to exon 6 (fig. 3). because
the normal in-frame stop codon in exon 4 is also present
in mor-1t, the putative protein encoded by mor-1t is
predicted to be identical to  xxxg1635xxx , although attempts to
characterize the flanking sequences of this splice variant
further have not been successful. the mor-1a variant,
which extends beyond the normal splice site in exon 3 and
lacks exon 4, was detected using forward primers from
exon 2, along with reverse primers from the exon 3
immediate 30 flanking sequence (fig. 2, lane 6).

to investigate the occurrence of  xxxg1635xxx  variants with
alternative 50 exons (mor-1g to mor-1n), pcrs were
carried out with forward primers from exon 11, along
with reverse primers derived from each of the exons 1a,
1b, 2, and 12–14. dna sequencing of pcr amplified
products revealed variants with exon 11 directly spliced to
either exon 1a or exon 2 (figs. 1, 2, lane 7). however, we
failed to detect transcripts with exon 11 spliced to exons
1b, 12, 13 and 14.
a variant previously reported in two abstracts only,
mu1,4 [27, 28], was also identified in the present study
and named mor-1s (figs. 1, 2, lane 8, genbank
accession ay397681). in mor-1s, exon 1 is directly
spliced to exon 4; consequently this variant lacks exons 2
and 3 which are conserved in all other known  xxxg1635xxx 
splice variants. notably, due to a frame-shift at the exon

different splice variants. intron sizes were calculated by aligning
exon sequences with the genomic sequence (genbank accession

we have identified 11 of the 17 proposed exons in the
 xxxg1635xxx  gene from mouse whole brain cdna, and verified
by dna sequencing the majority of the proposed exon
combinations used to make 21 distinct  xxxg1635xxx  splice
variants (fig. 1). as in previous reports [11, 12, 13],
alternative splicing was found to occur at both the 50 and
30 termini. except for an a to g substitution at nucleotide
position 16 in exon 10, predicting a met to val exchange
at amino acid 392 in mor-1f [12], the exon sequences
and splice sites between exons conformed to those
formerly described. this strongly indicates that the
cdnas we detected are true splice variants of the  xxxg1635xxx 
gene, and not artificial products produced during reverse
transcription or pcr amplification. notably, in the
present study, as in prior reports [12, 13], nested reactions
were required for the detection of most splice variants,
suggesting that the abundance of  xxxg1635xxx  splice variants
in whole brain is generally low, but not necessarily
biologically irrelevant. considering the complexity of the
opioid system, it is not quite unexpected that the fine-

tuning of opioid-related responses may rely on a highly
controlled expression of opioid receptor variants. the
inability to detect exons 5, 12–14 and 16–17, despite the
use of several primer sets and numerous pcr settings,
may reflect an extremely low abundance of these exons in
our material.
the identification of the novel mor-1t variant
demonstrates for the first time that exon 4 can be used
in combination with further downstream exons to make
up the 30-end of  xxxg1635xxx  splice variants. for variants
previously described, diversity at the 30 end involved
replacement of exon 4 with alternative exons. interestingly, antisense targeting of the different exons within
mor mrnas suggests that variants containing exon 4
and variants containing exons 6–10 are important in
morphine-induced analgesia [11, 12]. since no formerly
described variants include both exon 4 and combinations
of exons 6–10 it was reasonable to believe that more than
one  xxxg1635xxx  receptor is involved in morphine-induced
analgesia [29]. although a single receptor containing both
exon 4 and further downstream exons could account for
such an observation, our finding does not necessarily
contradict the previous interpretation.
at least four distinct transcripts from the  xxxg1635xxx  gene
have been found that have the potential to encode a
protein similar to  xxxg1635xxx . besides  xxxg1635xxx , theses include
mor-1h, mor-1i and mor-1j, and possibly also
mor-1t. the functional significance of the multiplicity
of mrnas encoding the  xxxg1635xxx  protein is not known. in
general these variants show different expression patterns
across brain regions, and are also expressed at different
levels [13]. it may be that different cell types use different
splice forms to generate the same protein, or alternatively,
it may serve as a regulatory mechanism related to mrna

stability and/or transport. however, all these possibilities
remain speculative and should be explored in greater
detail.
the internally truncated mor-1s variant (mu1,4) was
previously identified in mice [28], and a human counterpart was also demonstrated in shsy-5y neuroblastoma
cells [27]. the putative protein encoded by mor-1s
comprises 95 amino acids and is predicted to contain one
transmembrane helix oriented from outside to inside.
however, the biological relevance of this variant, if any,
is uncertain. it has been speculated that the mor-1s
protein could possibly be coupled to receptors with only
six transmembrane helices, mor-1g, mor-1m and
mor-1n, all of which lack the transmembrane domain
provided by exon 1. association of either one of these
receptors with mor-1s might yield a receptor with
similar characteristics as a receptor with seven transmembrane helices, but this possibility needs to be further
explored. it is also interesting to note that a reciprocal
relationship between the expression of the most common
variant  xxxg1635xxx  and mor-1s has been demonstrated [28],
suggesting a possible regulatory function.
in conclusion, our results support the view that the
 xxxg1635xxx  gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing at
both its 50 and 30 termini, as a likely major contributor to
the diversity of m opioid receptors. we have identified the
majority of exons and exon combinations used to make 21
differentially spliced cdnas. the novel finding that exon
4 is not always replaced in 30 end splicing, but may
combine with downstream exons, adds new complexity to
the mechanisms that control  xxxg1635xxx  gene splicing.
