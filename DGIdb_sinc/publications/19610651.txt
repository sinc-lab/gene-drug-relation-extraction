fak is a  xxxg2198xxx  that functions as a key orchestrator of signals leading to invasion and
metastasis. since fak interacts directly with a number of critical proteins involved in survival signaling
in tumor cells, we hypothesized that targeting a key protein-protein interface with druglike small
molecules was a feasible strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. in this study, we targeted the proteinprotein interface between fak and  xxxg802xxx  and identified compound c4 ( xxxd1673xxx  hydrochloride) as a drug capable of (1) inhibiting the biochemical function of  xxxg802xxx  and fak,
(2) inhibiting proliferation of a diverse set of cancer cell types in vitro, and (3) reducing tumor growth
in vivo.  xxxd1673xxx  hydrochloride reduced tumor growth as a single agent, while concomitant
administration with doxorubicin had a pronounced synergistic effect. our data demonstrate that the
fak- xxxg802xxx  interaction can be targeted by small druglike molecules and this interaction can
provide the basis for highly specific novel cancer therapeutics.

introduction
tumor cell survival requires that tumor cells acquire the
ability to survive the apoptotic stimuli associated with invasion and metastasis. focal adhesion kinase (faka) and
 xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx )
are tyrosine kinases that have been identified as critical
signaling molecules for these host-tumor interactions.1,2
fak is a protein  xxxg2198xxx  that is localized at contact
points between cells and extracellular matrix (ecm) and is
a point of convergence of a number of signaling pathways
associated with cell adhesion, invasion, motility, and angiogenesis.3-5 this signaling requires both fak kinase activity and its ability to form multiple protein complexes.6-10
targeting of fak by anti-fak antibody,11,12 fak dominant negative fak-cd,9,13 antisense oligonucleotides,14 or
sirna15-17 results in cell rounding, detachment, and apoptosis. fak is emerging as an attractive target for the treatment of cancer because it has been shown that fak is upregulated in a broad range of solid tumors and is expressed at
very low levels in normal tissues, creating an optimal setting
for fak-targeted cancer therapeutics.18,19 indeed, control of
fak signaling has been suggested as a potential anticancer
therapy20,21 and several fak kinase inhibitors recently have
been developed.22-24
 xxxg802xxx  or  xxxg802xxx  is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  playing a
major role in lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis and has also
been linked to tumorigenesis.2,25  xxxg802xxx  is activated by its
specific ligands, vegf-c and vegf-d, which promote

cancer progression.26 the vegf-c/ xxxg802xxx  axis is expressed in a variety of human tumor cells, and its activation
has been shown to promote metastasis.27 importantly, it has
been shown that inhibition of  xxxg802xxx  signaling leads to
both regression of the lymphatic network and suppression of
tumor lymph node metastasis.28  xxxg802xxx  is up-regulated in
the microvasculature of tumors and wounds,29,30 and recently,
blocking  xxxg802xxx  has been shown to suppress angiogenic
sprouting in tumors.2 while there is some controversy regarding the levels of expression of  xxxg802xxx  in tumor cells,31,32
 xxxg802xxx  remains an attractive target for cancer therapy.
previously we have shown that  xxxg802xxx  and fak physically interact in cancer cells, and this provides a survival
advantage for the tumor cells.7 thus, we have sought to
develop novel molecular therapeutics by targeting the
 xxxg802xxx -fak site of interaction and disrupting their
survival function. in the current study we utilized the crystal
structure of the fak focal adhesion targeting (fat) domain
for molecular docking of small molecules that target the
 xxxg802xxx  binding site on fak. we identified a small
molecule compound  xxxd1880xxx ( xxxd1673xxx  hydrochloride, a
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonist, 1) that disrupted  xxxg802xxx -fak binding and abrogated the phosphorylation of
 xxxg802xxx  while reducing the phosphorylation of fak. in
vitro testing of this compound resulted in the selective growth
inhibition and induction of apoptosis in many cancer cell
lines, especially those that overexpressed  xxxg802xxx . in vivo,
1 showed a marked reduction of tumor growth and was
synergistic with doxorubicin chemotherapy in breast cancer
xenograft models. these results have demonstrated that
targeting the fak- xxxg802xxx  interaction with a small molecule compound can disrupt the survival function of these two
tyrosine kinases, representing a unique approach for molecular-targeted cancer therapeutics.

results
structure-based development of small molecules that
targeted the binding of fak and  xxxg802xxx . we previously
demonstrated binding of the 12 amino acid peptide of
 xxxg802xxx  to the c-terminal, focal adhesion targeting
(fat) domain of fak.7 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (nmr) of the fat/ xxxg802xxx  peptide complex localized chemical shift of residue histidine 1025 on the fat
domain (prutzman and campbell, unpublished data), so
we hypothesized that a small molecule binding to this site
could disrupt the fak- xxxg802xxx  interaction. therefore,
we used the crystal structure of the fat domain of fak34 to
dock small molecules from the nci/dtp database to the
binding region in silico (figure 1a,b). we selected compounds with the highest binding affinities to fak for
functional testing and selected compound 1 (figure 1b, c)
for its profound inhibitory effect on cell growth. figure 1b
illustrates the binding mode of 1 with the fak fat domain.
in a panel of breast, colon, lung, osteosarcoma, melanoma,
and pancreas cancer cells, the ic50 of 1 varied between 1 and
20 mumu (figure 1d). because 1 was an orally bioavailable
antihistamine that inhibited cell survival, we selected it for

further mechanistic analyses, focusing on human breast
cancer.
1 specifically decreased the viability and proliferation and
caused apoptosis in breast cancer cells that expressed  xxxg802xxx . to further characterize small molecule 1 and its specificity,
we used two model systems of breast cancer: bt474 breast
cancer cells with high endogenous expression of  xxxg802xxx 
that we previously used to assess the fak- xxxg802xxx 
interaction7 and mcf7 breast cancer cells with undetectable
endogenous  xxxg802xxx  expression that were engineered to
overexpress  xxxg802xxx  (supporting information figure s1).
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 1, and
viability was measured with mts assay. bt474 cells were
highly sensitive to 1 treatment, whereby 1 mum concentration
caused a 40% reduction of viability after 48 h of treatment
(figure 2a). in addition, we found that the effect of 1 was
more pronounced in the bt474 breast cancer cells compared
to mcf10a “normal” breast epithelial cells (supporting
information figure s2a). next, we tested the specificity of
small molecule 1 in the mcf7- xxxg802xxx  overexpressing
cells. we found that at 1 mum concentration of 1, viability
of control mcf7-pcdna3 cells was significantly higher
than the viability of mcf7- xxxg802xxx  cells (figure 2a,

figure 2. 1 specifically decreased the viability and proliferation and caused apoptosis in breast cancer cells that expressed  xxxg802xxx . bt474
breast cancer cells with endogenous high  xxxg802xxx  expression and stable clones of mcf7 breast cancer cells with undetectable  xxxg802xxx 
expression, transfected with either control vector pcdna3 or  xxxg802xxx , were treated with the marked concentration of 1. (a) 1 caused a dosedependent cytotoxicity of  xxxg802xxx  expressing cells. the viability was measured in mts assays after 48 h of treatment: (/) p<0.01; (//) p<
0.001. (b) 1 caused a dose-dependent and a time-dependent decrease in proliferation of  xxxg802xxx  expressing cells: brdu incorporation assay,
(/) p < 0.05, (//) p < 0.001. (c) 1 treatment caused dose-dependent apoptosis, and proapoptotic effect of 1 is specific for cells expressing
 xxxg802xxx : tunel assay.

p<0.01) and  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentration this difference reached
2-fold (figure 2a, p<0.001). this demonstrated that cells
expressing low levels of  xxxg802xxx  were less sensitive to 1
inhibition than those that overexpressed this protein. taken
together, these data suggested that 1 specifically inhibited the
viability of cells overexpressing  xxxg802xxx .
proliferation assays have shown similar results. mcf7pcdna control cells did not show any decrease in proliferation even after 48 h of treatment with 10 mum 1 (figure 2b,
gray bars). in contrast, mcf7- xxxg802xxx  cells not only
proliferated much more quickly than vector controls but
were also sensitive to 1 treatment. in these  xxxg802xxx -overexpressing cells, a similar concentration of 1 for 48 h reduced
proliferation approximately 50%, demonstrating that the
antiproliferative effect of 1 is  xxxg802xxx  specific (figure 2b).
we also confirmed that proliferation of normal mcf10a
cells was not affected by small molecule 1 (supporting
information figure s2b). similarly, in the bt474 cells,
treatment with 1 also led to a concentration-dependent

decrease of cell proliferation (figure 2b). we also found
that there was no significant increase in brdu incorporation
in these cells exposed to 10 mum 1 for more than 12 h. we
concluded that 10 mum 1 had a cytostatic effect on bt474 cells
that might lead to apoptosis at later time points.
when treatment with 1 was continued for 48 h, the breast
cancer cells that overexpressed  xxxg802xxx  underwent apoptosis. this effect was dose-dependent, with 10 mum 1 inducing
apoptosis in more than 60% of bt474 cells (figure 2c).
furthermore, we found that apoptosis caused by 1 was related
to the level of  xxxg802xxx  expression. in our model cell lines
mcf7-pcdna3 and mcf7- xxxg802xxx , treatment with
10 mum 1 for 48 h led to a 4-fold increase in apoptotic cell
death in the cell line that overexpressed  xxxg802xxx  (18% versus
76%, respectively) (figure 2c). we confirmed these results
biochemically by measuring the cleavage of parp and the
activation of  xxxg342xxx  (supporting information figure s3).
from these experiments, we concluded that 1 caused  xxxg802xxx -dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

figure 3. 1 treatment affected colocalization and led to redistribution and decrease of fak- xxxg802xxx  complexes. cells were treated with
dmso (ctl, all panels a and b) or 10 mum 1 (all panels c and d) for 24 h, immunostained for fak (green, alexa fluor 488) in combination with
 xxxg802xxx  or  xxxg1904xxx  (red, alexa fluor 546). colocalization in treated and untreated cells was assessed by confocal microscopy and scatter plot
analysis (e). (a) treatment with small molecule 1 caused decrease in colocalization of fak and  xxxg802xxx  in bt474 cells: (a) merged image,
control cells; (b) colocalization, control cells; (c) merged image, 1 treated cells; (d) colocalization, 1 treated cells; (e) percentage of colocalized

antibody after treatment for 24 h with increasing concentrations of compound 1 revealed a decreased amount of fak protein coprecipitated
with  xxxg802xxx .

1 disrupted the fak- xxxg802xxx  complex. to determine
the effects of 1 on the interaction of fak and  xxxg802xxx , we
analyzed the distribution of fak and  xxxg802xxx  in the
bt474 and mcf7- xxxg802xxx  cells after treatment. as a
control, we also tested a different focal adhesion protein,
 xxxg1904xxx  that bound to the fat domain close to the  xxxg802xxx  binding site. cells were dually immunostained for fak in
combination with either  xxxg802xxx  or  xxxg1904xxx , and confocal
microscopy was used to calculate the degree of colocalization
by scatter plot analysis. in untreated cells, stained for fak
and  xxxg1904xxx , we found that approximately 80% of the fak
and  xxxg1904xxx  molecules were colocalized in bt474 cells and
positioned predominantly in focal adhesions (figure 3b,
panels a, b, e). similarly, the colocalization of  xxxg802xxx 
with fak was also high in untreated cells, with a rate of 80%
for bt474 (figure 3a, panels a, b, e) and 50% for mcf7vegfr-3 cells (figure 3c, panels a, b, e), and occurring
predominantly in the cytoplasm, as we have shown previously.7 when bt474 cells were treated with 1, the fakpaxillin localization was not affected (80% nontreated vs

76% treated, figure 3b, panels c, d, e). in contrast, 1 treatment dramatically decreased the colocalization of fak and
 xxxg802xxx  in the cytoplasm of both bt474 and mcf7vegfr-3 cells, reducing it to 45% and 29% respectively
(figure 3a and 3c, panels c, d, e). this drop in colocalized
fak and  xxxg802xxx  molecules correlated with intracellular
redistribution of these proteins after 1 treatment, revealed by
confocal microscopy and 3d reconstruction of the confocal
images. 1 treatment led to redistribution of fak and
 xxxg802xxx  inside the cells but did not affect the localization
of  xxxg1904xxx  (supporting information figure s4). we confirmed this effect on multiple samples of bt474 and mcf7vegfr-3 cells and with different fak and  xxxg802xxx 
antibody (supporting information figure  xxxg1865xxx ,b).
next, we used immunoprecipitation to confirm that 1
disrupted fak and  xxxg802xxx  binding. bt474 cells were
treated with an increasing concentration of 1, and the proteins were coprecipitated with  xxxg802xxx  antibody. we
found that treatment with 10 mum 1 for 24 h dramatically
decreased the amount of fak- xxxg802xxx  associated molecules

(figure 3d). thus, small molecule 1 specifically targeted the
fak- xxxg802xxx  interaction and disrupted the binding of
these proteins in the breast cancer cells.
1 caused dose-dependent dephosphorylation of both
 xxxg802xxx  and fak. to further characterize the biochemical
effects of 1 on  xxxg802xxx  and fak, we treated cells with
different concentrations of 1 and analyzed for the phosphorylation of tyr1063/1068 in the activation loop of the
 xxxg802xxx  kinase domain. we found that a 24 h treatment
with 1 mum 1 caused a partial dephosphorylation of this site
and 10 mum completely dephosphorylated this activation
site of  xxxg802xxx  (figure 4a,b). this effect was dose and
time dependent and appeared to be specific for  xxxg802xxx 
because it did not affect phosphorylation of other tyrosine
kinases including src, egfr, pdgfr, and  xxxg1145xxx  (data
not shown). at the same time this effect was 1-specific, as
other small molecules, selected for the fak- xxxg802xxx 
binding site, did not affect  xxxg802xxx  phosphorylation
(supporting information figure s3c). next, we assessed
changes in the total phosphorylation of fak. we found that
10 mum 1 treatment for 24 h decreased total fak phosphorylation in both model cell lines (figure 4c,d). taken together, these results show that 1 reduces the phosphorylation
of both  xxxg802xxx  and fak. since dephosphorylation of
fak has been shown to result in disruption of fak from its
position in the focal adhesions and lead to apoptosis,14 these
biochemical results are consistent with our findings that 1
treatment caused apoptosis in the tumor cells.
1 decreased tumor growth in vivo and sensitized the tumors
to chemotherapy. to further validate the activity of small
molecule 1, we employed a tumor xenograft mouse model.
female nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with
either the bt474 breast cancer cells or the mcf7 breast
cancer cells that stably overexpressed  xxxg802xxx . treatment
with small molecule 1 (60 mg/kg) was started the day
after injection of the cells and given for a total of 21 days.
1 caused a dramatic reduction of tumor growth in both
model systems whereby the tumor size in the treated groups

was approximately 20% of the tumor size in vehicle control
groups (figure 5, supporting information figure s6a,b).
similarly, the weights of the tumors in the treated group were
approximately 4 times less than in the untreated groups
(supporting information figure s6c). these results demonstrated significant in vivo efficacy of 1.
we also compared 1 with a different histamine receptor
h1 antagonist 2 (diphenhydramine) and found that it did not
have any effect on tumor growth when 1 reduced tumor
growth more than 75% (figure 6a). thus, we concluded
that the antitumor efficacy of 1 is not related to its antihistamine properties.
next, we tested the efficacy of the combination of 1 with
standard chemotherapy for breast cancer, because our in
vitro experiments have shown that 1 sensitized breast cancer
cells to doxorubicin treatment (data not shown). we tested
this combination approach in vivo by concomitant administration of lower dose 1 (10 mg/kg daily) and low-dose
of doxorubicin (0.3 mg/kg/week) in mice bearing bt474
xenografts. doxorubicin administered at 3 mg/kg caused
approximately 60% reduction of tumor growth but had no
effect on tumor growth at 0.3 mg/kg (figure 6b, triangles).
in contrast, there was a modest effect of 1 alone (50%
reduction of tumor growth, figure 6b, rectangles). however,
the low-dose combination of 1 and doxorubicin had a
prolonged antitumor effect (85% reduction of tumor
growth) that was greater than either drug alone (figure 6b,
dots). these data demonstrated a synergistic effect of the
combination of 1 with standard chemotherapy for breast
cancer.
discussion
in this report, we have demonstrated a unique approach to
cancer treatment by inhibiting fak and  xxxg802xxx  through
targeting the site of their protein-protein interaction. this
study has demonstrated that we can inhibit the function of
these tyrosine kinases by targeting their binding site. moreover, our computational approach for molecular docking has

bt474 (a) or mcf7- xxxg802xxx  (b) cells were inoculated into
mice subcutaneously. treatment with 60 mg/kg 1 or vehicle (pbs)
was started the day after cell inoculation. mice were sacrificed 21
days later, and tumors were measured for size and weight (supporting
information figure s6). bt474 and mcf7- xxxg802xxx  1-treated

identified a small molecule that not only decreased activity of
both  xxxg802xxx  and fak but had antitumor effects that were
synergistic with chemotherapy in vivo.
we selected the  xxxg802xxx  binding site on the fat domain
of fak as a template for our in silico studies because of the
importance of both of these kinases in cancer cell survival
and tumor progression. we virtually docked potential small
molecules and identified compound 1 ( xxxd1673xxx  hydrochloride). it was functionally equivalent to the fakinhibiting peptide from the  xxxg802xxx ,7 decreased cell proliferation, and caused apoptosis in breast cancer cells. to
prove that this small molecule affects interaction of  xxxg802xxx 
with fak, we analyzed fak- xxxg802xxx  colocalization and
coprecipitation in immunohistochemical and biochemical
experiments. we have shown that treatment with 1 decreased
colocalization and fak- xxxg802xxx  complex formation.
thus, in silico modeling demonstrated that peptide binding
sites of fak are appropriate targets for non-peptide small
druglike molecule binding.
studies with peptide inhibitors already have indicated that
blockade of specific protein-protein interactions have therapeutic promise for treating a variety of human cancers.35-37
the major advantage of protein-protein inhibitors is their
high selectivity. for example, the nutlins inhibitors of the p53mdm2 interaction activated apoptosis in cells expressing
wild-type p53 and showed a 10- to 20-fold selectivity for cells

properties, and it sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy treatment with
doxorubicin at low concentration. (a) mcf7- xxxg802xxx  cells were

with active versus mutated p53.38 in the present study,
targeting the site of fak- xxxg802xxx  protein-protein interaction represents a novel approach to targeting tyrosine
kinases that can potentially be used to disrupt their “interactome” and inhibit specific downstream signaling. until
now, the main approach to target fak was to inhibit the
catalytic activity of the  xxxg2198xxx  by interfering with the
binding of atp. three such inhibitors have been reported by
novartis22 and pfizer.23,24 all of them inhibit fak kinase
activity but have varying degrees of cross-reactivity with other
tyrosine kinases.39 similarly, the only known inhibitor for
 xxxg802xxx  is maz-51, which suppressed mammary tumor
growth in rats,40 but not having a broad clinical utility.
clinically, broad range  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are being
used to target the vegfr family in addition to other receptor
tyrosine kinases with varying degrees of success.41 in this
study, we have shown the specificity of 1 for fak and
 xxxg802xxx  whereby it changed the phosphorylation and
activation status of  xxxg802xxx  and fak by disrupting their
interaction and did not have a demonstrable effect on the
activity of other receptor and nonreceptor protein kinases.
the small molecule 1 that targeted the fak- xxxg802xxx 
binding site was  xxxd1673xxx  hydrochloride, belonging to

4722 journal of medicinal chemistry, 2009, vol. 52, no. 15

the class of antagonists of  xxxg1078xxx . this small
molecule was analyzed in mouse ascites tumor experiments of
honti and puntoky over 40 years ago42 when the hypothesis
that histamine might be involved in carcinogenesis was proposed,43 but the results were inconclusive. in our experiments,
we have shown a unique biological specificity of this drug for
the fak- xxxg802xxx  interaction. in our breast cancer xenograft models, we have shown that treatment with 1 reduced
tumor burden more than 80%, and this effect was not related
to its antihistamine properties when compared to the histamine blocker 2.
one of the most significant aspects of our findings relates to
the ability of 1 to sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapy.
when 1 was administered with the standard chemotherapeutic for breast cancer, doxorubicin, we saw a pronounced
synergistic effect, and this effect was still significant when we
reduced the dose of both drugs. because fak is a survival
signal and has been directly implicated in chemoresistance,44
we hypothesize that the decreased phosphorylation of fak
and  xxxg802xxx  caused by 1 results in a greater sensitivity of the
cancer cells to chemotherapy.
in summary, our data suggest that the fak- xxxg802xxx 
protein-protein interaction is an excellent site to develop
small molecule inhibitors to provide the basis for highly
specific novel cancer therapeutic agents. when this interaction
is targeted, survival signaling in the tumors can be interrupted,
and this may provide a useful method of augmenting the
effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer.

virtual screening. the dockv5.2 package9 was used for in
silico screening of approximately 140 000 compounds available
from the national cancer institute developmental therapeutics program. this small molecule database was prepared
with the dock accessory software sf2mol2 (university of
california;san francisco) and sybyl (tripos, inc.) as described previously.45 the crystal structure for focal adhesion
kinase (pdb code 1k0434) was obtained from the protein data
bank. all heteroatoms and water molecules were removed, and
a single chain was isolated in the coordinate file. the program
dms was used to generate a molecular surface.46 sphgen was
used to generate spheres on the surface of the protein, and a
subset of these spheres within 5 å of the target pocket was
selected to constrain the search space (figure 1a). molecular
mechanics force field grids were generated using the program
grid, using the standard 6-12 lennard-jones function to
approximate the van der waals forces. finally, dock 5.2 was
executed using the prepared files and the small molecule database. each compound was docked as a rigid body in up to 100
different orientations. the orientations were filtered by default
bump filter parameters to exclude compounds with pronounced
steric clashes. the top compounds predicted to interact with
the target site were subsequently obtained from the national
cancer institute.

described (supporting information figure s1). all cells are
maintained in correspondence with atcc recommendations.
antibodies and reagents. antihuman  xxxg802xxx  antibodies
were purchased from chemicon (mab3757, clone 9d9f9,

kurenova et al.

temecula, ca) and from santa cruz biotechnology (sc-321),
phospho-specific  xxxg802xxx  antibody (pc460) was from calbiochem (san diego, ca), fak antibody 4.47 was from upstate
and sc-558 from santa cruz biotechnology, phospho-specific
y-397 antibody mab1144 was from chemicon, and  xxxd1075xxx  specific antibody 4g10 (no. 05-321) was from upstate.
the following were from cell signaling technology (danvers,
ma): procaspase-8 (no. 9746), erk 1,2 (no. 9102), p-erk (no.
4377s), akt (no. 9272), p-akt (no. 9271), parp (no. 9542), and
 xxxg1904xxx  antibody no. 610051 from bd biosciences.
compound 1 was obtained as chlorpyramin hydrochloride
(sigma, no. 1915), solution for injection 20 mg/ml (egis,
hungary), 60 mul/injection, 60 mg/kg. also obtained was diphenhydramine (solution for injections 10 mg/ml), 60 mul/injection,
30 mg/kg.  xxxd1938xxx  injection, usp, is a sterile,
isotonic solution, 2 mg/ml, and was used as 30 mul/injection,
3 mg/kg, and 10 dilution, 0.2 mg/ml, 30 mul/injection, 0.3 mg/kg.
all chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available.
immunocytochemistry. cells were incubated in presence or
absence of 1 and stained with anti-fak antibody 4.47 or
in combination with  xxxg1904xxx  or  xxxg802xxx  as previously described7,9 and described in supporting information. detection
was done with alexa fluor 546 secondary antibody, and for
dual staining the combination of alexa fluor 488 and alexa
fluor 546 secondary antibody were used (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca). the slides were observed on a leica confocal microscope
(leica tcs sp5) running leica las-af software for instrument control and image analysis.
assays of cell viability. cell survival was assayed in mts
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium) assay by measuring mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity of metabolically active cells with
cell titer 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay
(promega, madison, wi). the 5.0  103 (100 mul) cells were
plated in 96-well plates and were allowed to attach overnight.
then 100 mul of fresh medium with or without 1 was added to
each well. cells were treated for the designated amount of time.
mts assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
detection of apoptosis was performed by tunel assay with
the apo-direct kit (pharmingen, bd biosciences, san
diego, ca) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
and analyzed by flow cytometry. quantitative analysis of apoptosis was performed using the flowjo program (tree star,
ashland, or).
immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. appropriately treated or nontreated cells were allowed to grow until they
were 80-85% confluent or until treatment was completed. cells
were lysed and used for western blot or immunoprecipitation as
previously described.7
brdu incorporation assay. brdu incorporation was performed using brdu cell proliferation assay, hts (calbiochem,
san diego, ca). the 2.5103 cells were plated into a 96-well
plate and allowed to attach overnight. then 100 mul of fresh
growth medium or growth medium with treatment was added
to each well followed by 20 mul of brdu labeling. cells were
incubated for the appropriate time and treated according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
animal models. bt474 and mcf7- xxxg802xxx  cells at a
concentration of (2-5)  106 cells per 200 mul were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of the 5-6 week old hsd:
athymic nude-foxn1nu mice (harlan), five in each group, in
accordance with the university of florida iacuc approved
protocol. treatment with compound 1 was started the next day
after cell injection via intraperitoneal injection (ip) once a day.
tumor size was measured thrice weekly, and volume was
calculated using the formula length  width2  0.5. animals
were sacrificed after 21 days of treatment or when tumor size
reached protocol end point. tumor was excised, measured and
preserved for protein and rna preparation and cytochemistry.

statistical analysis. data are represented as the mean ( sem
of three or more independent experiments. for in vitro and in
vivo experiments comparison between groups were made using
a two-tailed two-sample student’s t test. differences for which
the p value was less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
