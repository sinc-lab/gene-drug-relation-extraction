fauc 213, a highly selective  xxxg658xxx  full
antagonist, exhibits atypical antipsychotic properties
in behavioural and neurochemical models of schizophrenia

# springer-verlag 2004

abstract rationale: 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1ylmethyl]pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (fauc 213) is a highly
selective antagonist at the  xxxg658xxx  subtype.
it was designed as a derivative of two partial antagonists
and has been proven to be a complete antagonist in
mitogenesis assay. objectives: in the present study,
fauc 213 was examined for antipsychotic properties in
animal models of behavioural neurobiology and neurochemistry. methods: different concentrations of fauc
213 were screened for effects on spontaneous, as well as
amphetamine-induced, locomotor activity and apomorphine-induced prepulse disruption. the liability of causing
extrapyramidal side effects was investigated in models of
catalepsy and by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) detection of dopamine turnover in several brain
regions. the application schedule was validated, and the
bioavailability of the compound determined, by means of a
hplc-pharmacokinetic study. results: a significant
effect in both the reduction of amphetamine-induced
locomotor hyperactivity and the restoration of apomorphine-disrupted prepulse inhibition was found at 30 mg/
kg. this dose proved not to be high enough to induce
catalepsy or to increase dopamine turnover in the dorsal
striatum, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex.

the selective d4 antagonist fauc 213, therefore, is not
believed to mediate the above-mentioned effects via d2
receptor antagonism, but a partial involvement of 5-ht2and alpha1-receptors cannot be ruled out at present.
conclusions: we have gathered evidence that fauc
213 exhibits atypical antipsychotic characteristics.

introduction
since the  xxxg658xxx  was identified in 1990 by
van tol et al., there has been increasing interest in this
receptor subtype as a putative target for the treatment of
schizophrenia. the  xxxg658xxx  belongs to the d2-like
receptor family (d2, d3 and d4) that is characterised by
structural and functional similarities, such as a certain
degree of homology and congeneric g-protein coupling.
as the clinical potencies of typical neuroleptics, like
haloperidol, seem to be intimately correlated with their d2
receptor affinities (reviewed by snyder 1996), the fact that
some of these drugs also exhibit remarkable binding
properties towards the other d2-like receptors also aroused
fundamental interest in the d3 and  xxxg658xxx  subtype.
moreover, the considerable pharmacological profile of the
atypical antipsychotic clozapine has focused special
attention on the  xxxg658xxx , since it shows a moderate
2-fold to 5-fold preference for d4 over d2 (chabert et al.
1994; roth et al. 1995; newman-tancredi et al. 1997;
löber et al. 2001) and good correlations between the
clinically efficacious dose and its d4 affinity (seeman
1995; seeman and van tol 1995). it also shows superior
efficacy in refractory schizophrenia and negative symptoms such as amotivation and social withdrawal, as well as
a minimal risk or even absence of side effects such as the
extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) and elevation of the
prolactin level (reviewed by remington and kapur 2000).

the clinical use of clozapine is unfortunately restrained
by the approximate 1% incidence rate of agranulocytosis,
a presumably immune-mediated fatal lack of white blood
cells. the challenge is, therefore, to develop novel atypical
antipsychotics mimicking the unusual properties of clozapine. due to the binding profile of clozapine, there are
several approaches reflecting the different views about the
receptor basis of this atypical drug action (reviewed by
seeman et al. 1997). these various hypotheses include
low affinity for d2 as exclusive drug action, concurrent
antagonism at d2 and muscarinergic receptors, balanced
blocking of d2 and 5-ht2a receptors, and selective
antagonism at d4 receptors. with respect to the d4
research, numerous investigations have focused on receptor distribution in different brain regions, involving
autoradiographic labelling of receptor binding sites
(primus et al. 1997; lahti et al. 1998; de la garza and
madras 2000), neuroanatomical detection of receptor
protein using specific antibodies (mrzljak et al. 1996;
ariano et al. 1997; defagot et al. 1997) and localisation of
d4-mrna by means of northern blot/reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) (van tol et al.
1991; matsumoto et al. 1995, 1996; mulcrone and kerwin
1997). these studies suggest, in a largely consistent
manner, that d4 receptors are preferentially located in
limbic or cortical structures such as the amygdala and
hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex, respectively. these
are known to be involved in the regulation of mood and
cognition and are suspected of playing a part in the
aetiology of schizophrenia, although it remains controversial whether d4 levels are increased in schizophrenic
brains (seeman et al. 1993, 1995) or not (reynolds and
mason 1995). also, lower d4 levels were found, by
comparison, in the striatum and other regions modulating
motor functions, suggesting a small probability of causing
eps. taken together, this evidence indicated that selective
d4 antagonists could be valuable in further investigations
of the relevance of this receptor subtype in the treatment of
schizophrenia. now, after several of these compounds
have been tested and published, the issue remains
controversial (bristow et al. 1997; patel et al. 1997;
mansbach et al. 1998). for instance u-101958, a
prominent d4 selective antagonist, was found to exhibit
some agonistic activity (gazi et al. 1998, 1999). in
contrast, 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (fauc 213) was shown to be not only
highly d4 selective (table 1), but also a complete
antagonist with less than 3% agonistic activity compared
with the full agonist quinpirole (löber et al. 2001). fauc
213 was therefore considered worthy of having its
biological profile examined with methods of behavioural
neurobiology and neurochemistry as described in this
article.

experimental procedures

prepulse inhibition

animals

prepulse inhibition (ppi) testing was conducted in four ventilated
startle chambers (sr-lab, san diego instruments, san diego, ca),
each containing a transparent plexiglas tube (diameter 8.2 cm,
length 20 cm) mounted on a plexiglas frame. acoustic pulses and
prepulses were presented via a speaker mounted 24 cm above the
tube. motion inside the tube was detected by a piezoelectric
accelerometer below the frame. the amplitude of the whole body
startle to an acoustic pulse was defined as the average of 100 1-ms
accelerometer readings collected from pulse onset. delivery of the
acoustic stimuli and recording of startle responses were controlled
by a computer. the animals were tested in squads of four with startle
chambers counterbalanced across the different experimental groups.
after placing the animals inside the tubes, the startle session began
with a 5-min acclimatisation period during which only a 68-db(a)
background noise was presented. this background noise continued
throughout the session. after the acclimatisation period, four startle
pulses of 120 db(a), each of 30 ms duration, were presented. these
served to achieve a relatively stable level of startle reactivity for the
remainder of the test session since the most pronounced habituation
of the startle reflex occurs within the first few startle-pulse
presentations (geyer et al. 1990; koch 1999). to measure ppi, six
blocks of 11 trials each were presented. the 11 trials in each block
included: two “pulse-alone” trials, one “prepulse followed by pulse”
trial for each of four prepulse intensities, one “prepulse alone” trial
for each of four prepulse intensities, and one “no stimulus” trial.
prepulses were broad-band bursts of 20 ms duration and intensity of
either 72, 76, 80, or 84 db(a). the time interval between prepulse
offset and pulse onset was always 80 ms. the different trial types
were presented pseudo-randomly with an intertrial interval of 10–
20 s (average 15 s). altogether, a complete test session lasted about
23 min.

a total of 94 male adult wistar rats (zur:wist[hanibm]; research
unit schwerzenbach, schwerzenbach, switzerland), weighing 300–
350 g at the time of the experiments, were used in this study. the
animals were housed in groups of four per cage under a reversed
light-dark cycle (lights on: 1900–0700 hours) in a temperature- (21
±1°c) and humidity- (55±5%) controlled room with free access to
food (kliba 3430, klibamühlen, kaiseraugst, switzerland) and
water. beginning 3 days before the experiments, and continuing
throughout the study, all rats were handled daily. behavioural testing
was carried out during the dark phase of the cycle. all experiments
were conducted in accordance with swiss regulations for animal
experimentation.

drugs
all drug solutions were freshly prepared on the day of experiment.
fauc 213 was synthesised at the department of medicinal
chemistry of the friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nürnberg and prepared for peroral application as a 7.5, 15 and 30-mg/ml
solution in peg400/200 mm acetate-buffer (ph~3.9) = 40/60 with
the final ph adjusted to 4.3. d- xxxd163xxx  (sigma
chemical company, st. louis, usa) was dissolved in a 0.9%
nacl solution for intra-peritoneal injection in order to obtain a
concentration of 1.0 mg/ml calculated as the salt. for increased
stability, r(−)-apomorphine hydrochloride (sigma chemical company) was dissolved in 0.9% nacl containing 0.1%  xxxd228xxx 
giving a 0.1-mg/ml solution for subcutaneous administration.
haloperidol was diluted from ampoules with 5-mg/ml solvent
(janssen-cilag, baar, switzerland) with 0.9% saline to a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml and adjusted to ph 5.5 by addition of na2co3 to
enable intra-peritoneal injection.

apparatus and procedures for behavioural testing
detection of locomotor activity
locomotor activity was measured in 15 stations, each being a clear
plastic compartment 25 cm wide × 40 cm long × 40 cm high and
completely embedded within an individual sound-attenuating
wooden cabinet. one end wall of each compartment was made of
wood, and the floor consisted of a black removable pan containing a
thin layer of dark absorbent, autoclaved earth. a large drop-down
door in the front wall of every compartment allowed easy access to
the animal. a fan mounted on the wall of each cabinet provided
adequate ventilation and a camera was mounted in the ceiling,
centred approximately 49 cm above the compartment floor. the
field of vision of this camera included the entire area in which the
animal was freely able to move. the stations were located in a wellventilated, temperature-, humidity- and sound-controlled room used
only for this experiment. all the cameras were connected to a 16channel multiplexer (sony model ys-dx216ce) located in an
adjacent room, and the multiplexer was connected in turn to a dell
optiplex gxpro computer running image-analysis software (visual
basic program based on an nih image analysis script). each white
wistar rat was monitored against a darker background. an image
from each of the stations was taken every second and compared with
the previous one. the activity or animal’s displacement was
measured as pixel changes (from light to dark and vice versa) per
second. one-second activity values ranged from 0% (no movement)
to approximately 7.5%. the multiplexed images from the 15 stations
could be recorded simultaneously on one videotape with a sony
svt-1000p video recorder and viewed on a single monitor.

catalepsy bar test
the animals were tested in a perspex box measuring 26×17×17 cm
containing a bar mounted 10 cm above the floor. following a
habituation period of 1 min, the animals were gently placed with
their front paws on the bar while their hind paws remained on the
floor. the latency for the rat to remove both front paws from the bar
was measured, up to a maximum of 120 s.

catalepsy paw test
a 30×30-cm perspex plate mounted on plastic feet 20 cm above the
floor was utilised. the plate contained two holes of 4 cm diameter
for the forelimbs and two holes of 5 cm diameter for the hindlimbs,
as well as an opening for the tail. the rat was held behind the
forelimbs and gently placed in the holes, first with the hindlimbs and
then with the forelimbs. the latency for the rat to retract one of the
front paws was measured from the moment the rat retracted one of
the hind paws (up to a maximum of 120 s).

experimental design
locomotor activity
spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotion was assessed in
the 15 test boxes with 30 rats on two successive days. on day 1,
each rat was placed in one of the boxes and left there for 60 min to
measure spontaneous (baseline) activity. the rats were then
allocated to five treatment groups (veh+veh, veh+amph,
f7.5+amph, f15+amph and f30+amph) consisting of n=6
animals per group matched for baseline locomotor activity. on day 2
(treatment day), each rat was perorally pretreated with fauc 213 in
three different drug doses (7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg bodyweight) or

10
vehicle (made-up of the identical solute as used to dissolve fauc
213: peg400/100mm-acetate-buffer(ph~3.9)=40:60 adjusted to a
ph~4.3), and then immediately placed in the same box as the
previous day for 60 min to monitor the influence of fauc 213
versus veh on spontaneous locomotion. following this, all rats
were injected intra-peritoneally with 1.0 mg/kg amphetamine or
0.9% saline and instantly replaced in their boxes for another 105 min
to monitor the effects of fauc 213 pretreatment versus veh on
amph-induced hyperactivity.

ppi experiments
thirty-nine naive rats were used for the ppi experiment, conducted
on two successive days. on day 1, all rats were subjected to baseline
ppi testing and were then matched according to their ppi and startle
response in four treatment groups. on day 2, the effect of
pretreatment with fauc 213 at dose levels of 15 mg/kg and
30 mg/kg versus veh pretreatment was tested on apomorphinedisrupted ppi. pre-treatment was applied perorally 45 min prior to
the subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg/kg apo versus veh (0.1%
 xxxd228xxx  in 0.9% saline). since apo penetrates quickly into the
brain, the animals were placed in the ppi-boxes approximately
5 min after the injection. the four differently treated groups had
sizes as follows: veh+apo: n=9; veh+veh, f15+apo and f30
+apo: n=10.

catalepsy experiments
the experimental protocol consisted of three groups of eight
animals. haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), fauc 213 (30 mg/kg, p.o.)
or vehicle (peg400/100mm-acetate-buffer=40:60-adj. to ph~4.3, p.
o.) was applied 45 min before testing. the rats were first monitored
in the catalepsy bar test and then in the catalepsy paw test, as
previously described.

neurochemical and pharmacokinetic experiments

tissue preparation
the frozen brains were placed ventral side up in a rat brain matrix
(harvard apparatus, south natick, ma, usa) on an ice-chilled
plate. double-edge blades were used to prepare coronal sections
approximately 2 mm thick. the partially frozen slices were placed
on an ice-cold dissection plate for the removal of discrete brain
regions using a 2-mm diameter punch tip together with the mp-600
micropunch system (harvard apparatus). tissue punches from the
right and left hemispheres were taken together for subsequent
neurochemical analysis. three structures were prepared according to
the atlas of paxinos and watson (1986): the medial prefrontal cortex
(mpfc) was prepared from the first slice (bregma 4.80 to 2.80), the
nucleus accumbens (nacc) from the next slice (bregma 2.80 to
0.80), and the dorsal striatum (dstr) from the adjacent slice (bregma
0.80 to −1.20). the punching was accomplished as shown in
fig. 1a for the mpfc, 1b for the nacc and 1c for the dstr. the
tissue samples were weighed and placed in 1.5-ml plastic tubes
containing ice-cooled perchloric acid (300 µl, 0.4 m), homogenised
for 10 s using ultrasound and centrifuged for 20 min at 15000 g and
4°c. the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-µm filter and kept at
4°c until high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis.

determination of dopamine and metabolites
dopamine and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopac) and homovanillic acid (hva) were analysed using
reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography combined with electrochemical detection under isocratic conditions. the detector potential
was set at +750 mv using a glassy carbon electrode and a ag/agcl
reference electrode. the mobile phase (34.88 mm  xxxd1710xxx ,
54.37 mm sodium acetate, 0.67 mm ethylene diamine tetraacetic
acid disodium salt, 0.69 mm 1-octanesulfonic acid, 4% methanol in
hplc grade water, final ph 4.10) was delivered at a flow rate of
1.0 ml/min at 30°c onto the reversed-phase column [100×3.0 mm
with guard column 10×3.0 mm filled with chromsher 5b (varian
chromsep, palo alto, usa)]. aliquots (20 mul) were injected by an
autosampler with cooling module set at 4°c. data were calculated
using an external standard calibration.

postmortem hplc analysis of dopamine metabolism
after the catalepsy testing procedure, the animals were taken to a
separate room where they were sacrificed by decapitation exactly
60 min after the application of fauc/hal/veh. the brains were
removed rapidly, quickly frozen and stored at −20°c until preparation.

(0.80 mm to −1.20 mm bregma)

pharmacokinetic study
twenty male wistar rats were treated with fauc 213 (30 mg/kg, p.
o.) 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 min before being sacrificed by decapitation.
four untreated animals were also decapitated to enable calibration of
the extraction process by spiking and extracting comparable brain

11
tissue under analogous conditions. all 24 brains were rapidly
removed, quickly frozen and stored at −80°c until further analysis.

calculated by an external standard calibration. brain tissue of
untreated animals was spiked with different concentrations of fauc
213 in the range of 500 ng to 6000 ng per sample.

sample preparation
data analysis
the frozen brains were weighed before being placed in 50-ml plastic
tubes and covered with 15 ml chloroform. the brain tissue was
homogenised in a cooling room at 4°c using an ultra-turrax t25
(janke&kunkel ika-labortechnik, staufen i. br.) at ~20000 rpm
for 60 s and stored afterwards on ice for 120 s. a 5-n naohsolution (200 µl) was then added, and this mixture was homogenised
two further times for 60 s each, storing it for another 60 s on ice inbetween. an additional 15 ml chloroform was used to wash the
adherent homogenate from the ultraturrax into the tube. these were
stored on ice until re-mixing the tubes for 1 min by shaking and then
centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 min. the organic layer was
subsequently transferred into a round glass flask and evaporated to
dryness at 474 mbar and 40°c. the residue was redissolved and
sonicated for 15 min in 3 ml chloroform, passed through a 0.2-µm
filter and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 70°c. finally, it
was redissolved again by a 15-min ultrasound treatment in 500 µl of
a 60:40 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile-water (containing 0.1% formic
acid) and filtered through a membrane filter and stored at −80°c
until hplc analysis.

detection of fauc 213 brain levels
fauc 213 was analysed using reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography combined with uv detection at 258-nm wave length under
gradient-elution conditions. the mobile phase ( xxxg2345xxx : acetonitrile/
mph2:25 mm kh2po4, 5 mm pentanesulfonic acid in hplc grade
water, final ph 7.00) was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at
40°c onto the reversed-phase column [250×3.0 mm with guard
column 40×3.0 mm filled with lichrosorb rp18 (merck kg,
darmstadt, germany)] of a particle size of 7 µm or 10 µm,
respectively. the composition of the mobile phase was controlled by
a gradient-time program consisting of five time periods: 0–15 min:
plateau at 60%  xxxg2345xxx /15–20 min: ramp from 60% to 90%  xxxg2345xxx /20–
30 min: plateau at 90%  xxxg2345xxx /30–40 min: ramp from 90% to 60%
 xxxg2345xxx /40–60 min: plateau at 60%  xxxg2345xxx  (to restore starting
conditions). fifty microliter aliquots were injected. data were

(c). all data are given as mean
values of 5-min bins±sem.
asterisks denote only the minimum effective dose compared

all statistical analyses were performed with the statview software
system (abacus concepts, inc., berkeley, ca, 1992) using analysis
of variance (anova). data are presented as means. in the text and
in bar plots, the variability is indicated by the standard error of the
mean (sem). fisher’s protected least significant difference test was
used for post-hoc comparisons following a significant main effect or
interaction revealed by anova. significant differences were
accepted at p<0.05.

locomotor activity experiment
the locomotor activity of the rat was calculated as mean percentage
pixel-change for each 5-min block of testing. a 5×12 anova
consisting of a between-subjects factor of treatment (veh+veh,
veh+amph, f7.5+amph, f15+amph, f30+amph) and a
repeated-measurements factor of 12 5-min blocks was used to
analyse the 1-h baseline activity and also the 1-h activity following
injection of vehicle or fauc 213 at doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg.
a similar 5×21 anova was used to examine the 105 min following
amph injection.

ppi experiment
the percentage of ppi (%ppi) induced by each prepulse intensity
was calculated as: [100–(100×startle amplitude on prepulse
followed by pulse-trial)/(startle amplitude on pulse-alone trial)]
from the data taken during the six test blocks to measure ppi. the
overall mean %ppi was calculated for the four prepulse intensities,
whereas the mean startle amplitude was calculated as the average
response to the 16 “pulse-alone” trials. the analyses consisted of
three-way anovas with a between-subjects factor of treatment
(veh+veh, veh+apo, f15+apo, f30+apo) and two withinsubjects factors of day (baseline day, treatment day) and either the

12
16 “pulse-alone” presentations (startle responses) or the four
prepulse intensities (%ppi).

catalepsy bar and paw test
the cataleptic behaviour of the rat was scored from 1 to 5 according
to the (square root transformed) retraction times (min): 1=t<0.09,
2=t<0.36, 3=t<0.81, 4=t<1.44, 5=t≥1.44 min. anovas consisting
of the between-subjects factor of treatment (veh, fauc 213, hal)
were used for the bar test as well as the frt (forelimb retraction
time) and hrt (hindlimb retraction time) of the paw test.

postmortem hplc-analysis of dopamine metabolism
dopamine turnover was calculated as ratio of the concentrations (ng/
mg tissue) of (hva + dopac)/da for the separately analysed
samples of the three different brain regions: nacc and dstr. a 3×3
anova with a between-subjects factor of treatment (veh, fauc
213, hal) and a within-subjects factor of region (nacc and dstr)
was performed to evaluate the effects of fauc 213 versus
haloperidol and vehicle on dopamine metabolism.

locomotion after fauc/veh application
locomotor activity decreased over the 12 5-min bins
(f11,275=75.18, p<0.001), again reflecting habituation to
the apparatus. no significant differences between treatments were found, indicating that spontaneous locomotor
activity is not affected by the application of fauc 213
alone (fig. 2b).
activity during the 105-min monitoring locomotor
hyperactivity following amphetamine injections
the analysis of amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity yielded a significant main effect of treatment
(f4,25=2.78, p<0.05), a significant effect of 5-min bins
(f20,500=8.24, p<0.001) and a significant effect of treatment × 5-min bin interaction (f80,500=1.33, p<0.001).
post-hoc tests revealed that, compared with veh injection, all four amphetamine-injected groups showed a
significant elevation in activity (all p<0.001). only pretreatment with fauc 30 mg/kg was able to significantly
reduce this elevation in amph-induced locomotor hyperactivity (p<0.001) (fig. 3c and fig. 4).

fig. 4 effects of pretreatment with fauc 213 (15 mg/kg or
30 mg/kg, p.o.) on prepulse inhibition disruption by apomorphine
(0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) in wistar rats. pretreatment was applied 45 min
prior to apomorphine. values are represented as means±sem of
n=9–10 rats per group. asterisks denote significant differences
between treatments as revealed by fisher’s plsd post-hoc tests
(**p<0.01, *p<0.05)

effects of apomorphine and apomorphine + fauc
213 (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) on startle response
there was no significant difference in the startle response
amplitude of the animals between the different treatment
groups. a habituation of the startle response amplitude
over the 16 “pulse-alone” presentations was apparent
(f15,525=19.76, p<0.001). in addition, the significant
effect of day (f1,35=11.09, p<0.0025) and the interaction
of day × pulse presentation (f15,525=2.52, p<0.002)

reflected the steeper habituation on day 2 compared with
day 1 (data not shown).

effects of fauc 213 (30 mg/kg) vs haloperidol
(0.3 mg/kg) and vehicle on dopamine metabolism in
mpfc, nacc and dstr

effects of apomorphine and apomorphine + fauc
213 (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) on ppi

analysis of dopamine turnover showed a highly significant effect of treatment for the nacc (f2,21=12.68,
p<0.001) and the dstr (f2,21=63.72, p<0.0001), with a
tendency towards significance for the mpfc (f2,21=3.22,
p<0.065). post-hoc comparisons revealed that the ratio of
dopamine turnover was significantly increased by haloperidol compared with both vehicle and fauc 213
(nacc: p<0.001; dstr: p<0.0001; mpfc: p<0.05),
whereas fauc 213-treated animals had a dopamine
turnover virtually identical to that of vehicle-treated
animals (fig. 6).

the analysis of ppi yielded a nearly significant main effect
of treatment (f3,35=2.65, p<0.065), a significant main
effect of day (f1,35=40.95, p<0.001) and a significant
interaction of treatment × day (f3,35=4.25, p<0.015). this
reflected the fact, that while apomorphine in its own right
completely abolished the ppi response, fauc 213 dose
dependently reduced this disruption (fig. 4). post-hoc
comparisons revealed that on the treatment day (day 2)
only fauc 30 mg/kg was able to significantly restore the
ppi reduction caused by the apo treatment (p<0.04), to
the extent that this group did not differ significantly from
the veh group (p>0.16). a significant effect of prepulse
intensity (f4,105=29.02, p<0.001) reflected the increased
effectiveness of higher intensities of the prepulse stimulus
to induce stronger ppi.
effects of fauc 213 (30 mg/kg) vs haloperidol
(0.3 mg/kg) and vehicle on catalepsy bar and paw test
a significant effect of treatment was found for the bar test
(f2,21=108.97, p<0.0001), as well as for the forelimb
retraction time (f2,21=12.02, p<0.001) and the hindlimb
retraction time (f2,21=145.80, p<0.0001) of the paw test.
post-hoc comparisons revealed that the mean scores of
fauc 213-treated animals did not differ from those of the
veh group, but haloperidol-treated animals had significantly elevated scores (all p<0.001) (fig. 5).

pharmacokinetic profile of fauc 213
as shown in fig. 7, brain levels of fauc 213 determined
30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after peroral application
(30 mg/kg) produced a “bateman-like” kinetic curve
typical for this kind of drug administration. fauc 213
penetrated rapidly into the brain, where it reached its
highest concentration (2.09±0.63 µg/g) after 45 min and
stayed at this level for about 15 min. this time period was
in good agreement with the ppi experimental schedule. in
addition, there was an interesting correlation between the
decline of substance concentration in the brain after about
100 min, to less than half of cmax, with the convergence of
the 30-mg/kg fauc curve to the veh+amph curve in
amphetamine-induced locomotor activity monitoring at
about the same time. the calibration curve was calculated
by linear regression of the detected amount of fauc 213
against the spiked amount and yielded r2~0.994.

as the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms
of schizophrenia, together with a necessarily good compliance achievable by the absence of adverse side effects
such as extrapyramidal motoric symptoms or agranulocytosis, remains an unsolved challenge, many investigative
efforts have been made to understand the basis of receptor
interaction responsible for the atypical properties of
clozapine. due to the considerable affinities it shows to
a number of pharmacological targets like d2, d4, 5ht2a/c, 31 and m1 (for d2, d4 and 5-ht2a/c see table 1,
ki(alpha1)=3.7 nm and ki(m1)=0.98 nm as reviewed by arnt
and skarsfeldt 1998), the value of each single receptor, or
possible combination of receptors, is hard to determine. as
a consequence, different working hypotheses were established following the strategy of imitating one or more
elements of that binding profile to gain the same superior
clinical quality without the liability of causing the rare, but
severe, side effect of agranulocytosis. some of these have
focused on balanced 5-ht2/d2-affinity often also including high alpha1-affinity, as shown by risperidone, or affinity

fig. 7 brain levels of fauc 213 (30 mg/kg, p.o.) at five different
times after application. animals were decapitated after 30, 45, 60,
90 and 120 min. concentrations of fauc 213 were determined by
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis
using ultraviolet detection after extraction from the brain matrix.
the system was calibrated by spiking brain tissue of untreated
animals yielding a linear regression of r2~0.9935. the y-axis
represents relative concentrations of fauc 213 in µg/g wet brain
tissue (weighted in frozen condition). concentrations are presented
as mean values±sem of n=3–4 animals for each time point

for muscarinic receptors, like olanzapine (reviewed by
arnt and skarsfeldt 1998). but, because of these multiple
receptor interactions (often also including 5-ht2c or h1),
these substances produce a number of other side effects
such as weight gain, sedation, dizziness, postural hypotension or dry mouth (rowley et al. 2001). another branch
of research was the evaluation of highly selective
substances acting at only one target. due to the moderate
selectivity of clozapine for d4 versus d2 receptors and the
finding that d4 receptors seem to be preferentially located
in limbic or cortical structures suspected of being
associated with schizophrenia, whereas only very low
levels are found in the striatum and other regions

modulating motor functions, the  xxxg658xxx 
subtype was considered to be one of the most interesting
targets. with regard to this, fauc 213 was designed by
studies of regioisomers using fauc 113 and fauc 299
as lead structures (löber et al. 2001) and was shown to be
a complete antagonist in [3h]thymidine incorporation as
evidence for mitogenetic activity in contrast to its partial
agonist precursors (fig. 8). in addition, fauc 213 had
superior binding properties relative to fauc 113, a higher
affinity towards d4 (ki=2.2 nm vs 3.6 nm), as well as an
increased selectivity of about 2900-fold for d4.4 vs d2,
240-fold for d4.4 vs 5-ht2 and 120-fold for d4.4 vs alpha1
(table 1). in order to study the putative antipsychotic
effects of fauc 213, it was examined in several wellknown models of behavioural neurobiology and neurochemistry, including pharmacokinetic validation of the
applied parameters and doses. throughout the whole
study, male wistar rats were used as subjects of experiment, as fauc 213 showed binding affinities at rat-d2
and d4-receptors [ki(rd2)=1.1 nm and ki(rd4)
>1000 nm], which are in line with the binding affinities
at the human d2 and d4 receptors (table 1).
stimulant-induced hypermotility, as a common model
of in vivo screening of putative antipsychotics, was
employed to determine effective doses of fauc 213
when given perorally to rats. pilot studies suggested, that
adequate doses of fauc 213 should start at about 5–
10 mg/kg. we therefore chose 7.5 mg/kg as the lowest
dose, and in addition used 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg by
doubling the dose for dose–response studies. no significant effects on modification of spontaneous locomotor
activity were observed at doses up to 30 mg/kg (p.o.). this
served as a control that the drug itself does not exhibit
unspecific, especially sedating, effects. in contrast, a dose
of 30 mg/kg fauc 213 significantly decreased amphinduced hyperactivity. such an attenuation of hyperactivity is shown both by typical (like haloperidol), as well as
atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine or risperidone).
it is therefore believed that direct d2 antagonism may

antagonists fauc 113 and fauc 299 as precursors of the d4selective complete antagonist fauc 213. #agonistic effects are
given by the rate of [3h]-thymidine incorporation as evidence for
mitogenetic activity related to the full agonistic effect of quinpirole
(100%), according to hübner et al.(2000) and löber et al. (2001)

contribute much to this effect, although other receptors
(d4, alpha1, 5-ht2a/c, etc.) undoubtedly have some impact.
ppi of acoustic startle in rats, one of the most
intensively studied animal models with predictive validity
for antipsychotic properties of compounds (reviewed by
geyer et al. 2001), was also used for evaluating fauc
213. as a model of sensorimotor gating, the ppi paradigm
reduces the startle reflex by a weak prepulse preceding the
startle pulse, without it having the power to induce a startle
reflex by itself. this phenomenon has been shown to be
remarkably attenuated in schizophrenic patients. analogically, it is disruptable in rodents or humans by treatment
with, for instance, dopamine agonists (apomorphine) or
dopamine releasers (amphetamine, braff et al. 2001) and
can be restored by typical and atypical antipsychotics. in
accordance with the results obtained by measuring
amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, we decided to
perform the experiment at treatment levels of 15 mg/kg
and 30 mg/kg (p.o.) fauc 213 (the highest ineffective
and the effective doses). testing of higher doses was
considered to be not appropriate, to the best of our
knowledge, as we would lose receptor specificity. a doserelated increase in ppi compared with the vehiclepretreated apomorphine group was found, with a significant effect at 30 mg/kg. additionally, no significant
effects on startle magnitude were detected, which indicates
that the effects on ppi are not influenced by unspecific
drug action such as sedation. these results confirm
previously seen effects and also seem to concur with
other investigations on predominantly d4 selective
compounds (bristow et al. 1997; mansbach et al. 1998),
which reported significant restoration of the apomorphineinduced ppi deficit only at elevated doses. this raises the
question whether receptors other than d4 play a (major)
role in the observed effects. although mixed d2/5-ht2

antagonists were reported to decrease the effect of
apomorphine on ppi (reviewed by geyer et al. 2001),
the pure 5-ht2 antagonist mdl 100,907 restored ppi
deficits caused by 5-ht2a agonists, nmda antagonists
and isolation rearing, but not apomorphine (geyer et al.
1999). likewise the alpha1 antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  was shown to
have an impact on the phencyclidine, but not apomorphine
disruption of ppi (bakshi and geyer 1997). as a result of
data obtained from knock-out mice (dulawa et al. 2000),
the activation of 5-ht1a receptors is believed to increase
ppi. therefore, the 5-ht1a antagonist (−)-uh-301
decreased ppi, whereas the 5-ht1a antagonist way
100,135 showed an effect on neither ppi nor on restoration
of ppi disruption caused by the d2/d3 agonist 7-ohdpat (reviewed by geyer et al. 2001). all these data
suggest that antagonism at neither alpha1, 5-ht1a, nor 5-ht2
receptors is likely to contribute to the observed effects.
because  xxxg656xxx  occupation is known to be correlated
to the adverse side effect eps, we investigated whether d2
receptors are involved in the drug action at a dose level of
30 mg/kg fauc 213. therefore, it was tested in models of
catalepsy against 0.3 mg/kg haloperidol as positive
control. fauc 213 clearly had no effect in either the bar
test (kuschinsky and hornykiewicz 1972) or the paw test
(ellenbroek et al. 1987). as exemplified by haloperidol,
typical antipsychotics usually reduce stimulated hypermotility at the same dose levels that induce catalepsy in rats,
since both effects are most likely to be caused by d2
antagonism. atypical antipsychotics, however, are devoid
of cataleptic effects at doses potent in stimulated hypermotility (arnt and skarsfeldt 1998). the conclusion is,
therefore, that fauc 213 is not thought to be mediating its
effects via a high  xxxg656xxx  occupation.
to further establish this deduction, we investigated the
neurochemical effects of fauc 213 versus haloperidol in
three different brain regions known to be involved in
antipsychotic drug action by postmortem hplc analysis
of dopamine and its metabolites. in both the nacc and the
dstr, haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg) produced significantly
elevated levels of hva and dopac, which contributed
mainly to the increase of the dopamine turnover ratio,
whereas fauc 213 did not alter either dopac- and
hva- or da levels. in the mpfc, haloperidol decreased
da levels, but only slightly increased levels of hva and
dopac, resulting in a nonetheless higher da turnover,
whereas fauc 213 again did not alter da levels and only
slightly elevated the sum of dopac- and hva levels. the
results for haloperidol correspond to previous investigations (karoum and egan 1992; patel et al. 1997), except
for the fact that the increase in the turnover ratio in mpfc
was mediated by da decrease instead of increase of
dopac+hva. as fauc 213 had no effect on dopamine
turnover in nacc and dstr, and only a negligible effect on
the dopac+hva levels in mpfc, it is supposed that this
is due to a lack of activity at presynaptic d2 receptors and
the absence of presynaptic d4 receptors. the blocking of
the inhibitory effect of such presynaptic receptors on the
release of dopamine into the synaptic gap followed by
subsequent metabolisation to hva or dopac (westerink

16

1985) might not be the only possible explanation for the
observed results, but it seems to be more plausible and
concrete than the assumption of postsynaptic receptor
blockade followed by a positive feedback mechanism on
this synapse or on other dopaminergic neurons in this area.
the lack of effect on dopamine metabolism shown at a
dose of 30 mg/kg of fauc 213 in this study, together with
the inability to cause catalepsy, may account for the fact
that, in contrast to haloperidol, there are not enough d2
receptors occupied in brain regions controlling motor
functions in order to cause extrapyramidal side effects.
furthermore, our pharmacokinetic investigations revealed that the nominally high dose of 30 mg/kg only
results in mean cmax levels of about 2.1 µg (6.4 nmol) per
gram brain tissue. this might be due to weak peroral
availability, efficient metabolising mechanisms or poor
galenic formulation. in addition, the pharmacokinetic data
confirm that the behavioural and neurochemical experiments were conducted when optimal levels of fauc 213
were present in the brain.

conclusions
peroral administration of the  xxxg658xxx  full
antagonist fauc 213 yielded a significant effect in both
the reduction of amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and in the restoration of apomorphine-disrupted
ppi at a minimal effective dose of 30 mg/kg. although this
dose seemed to be nominally high, only a small fraction
was found present in brain after a period of 45–60 min.
additionally, this dose level proved not to be high enough
to induce catalepsy in rats or to increase dopamine
turnover in the dstr, nacc and mpfc by antagonism of
d2 receptors. in summary, we have gathered evidence, that
fauc 213 exhibits atypical antipsychotic characteristics,
although it remains uncertain whether other receptors such
as adrenergic or serotoninergic were partially involved in
the effects found in this study. the d4 antagonist fauc
213 should, therefore, be further examined.
