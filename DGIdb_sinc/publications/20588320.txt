cortical spreading depression (csd) is an intense depolarization wave implicated in the
pathophysiology of brain injury states and migraine aura. as  xxxg302xxx  channels modulate csd
susceptibility, we tested gabapentin, which inhibits  xxxg302xxx  through high-affinity binding to its a2d
subunit, on csd susceptibility in anesthetized rats. gabapentin, 100 or 200 mg/kg, elevated the
electrical threshold for csd and diminished recurrent csds evoked by topical kcl, when
administered 1 hour before testing. with its favorable safety and tolerability profile, gabapentin
may have a role in suppression of injury depolarizations in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and
traumatic brain injury.

introduction
cortical spreading depression (csd) is a wave of
neuronal and glial depolarization associated with
massive k + and glutamate efflux, and ca2 + influx,
slowly propagating in the brain tissue at a rate of 3 to
4 mm/min by way of gray matter contiguity. although
the massive rise in extracellular k + is critical for
contiguous spread, glutamate adds momentum to
sustain the propagation. among pharmacological
inhibitors of csd are ca2 + channel blockers, in
particular of the  xxxg302xxx  subtype (kunkler and kraig,
2004; richter et al, 2002), possibly by reducing the
release of glutamate during csd. gabapentin, an

adjunct antiepileptic that has shown modest efficacy
in migraine prophylaxis, inhibits the  xxxg302xxx  channel
by binding with high affinity and specificity to its
auxiliary a2d subunit, which both diminishes the
voltage responsiveness of channels and prevents their
localization to the neurotransmitter release sites (gee
et al, 1996; hendrich et al, 2008).
as the  xxxg302xxx  channel is a major regulator of
glutamate release, and a modulator of csd susceptibility, we tested the efficacy of gabapentin to
suppress csd. our results show a novel acute
inhibitory effect of gabapentin on csd.

materials and methods
a total of 32 rats (sprague-dawley, 200 to 450 g, male) were
used to test gabapentin on csd. gabapentin doses and
treatment protocols were chosen based on published data
in other animal models of neurological diseases (radulovic
et al, 1995). gabapentin was administered as a single 100
or 200 mg/kg intravenous dose (n = 7 and 14, respectively;
research chemical) 60 minutes before csd testing; intravenous route was chosen because of the saturable oral
absorption kinetics, and nonlinear oral bioavailability
(radulovic et al, 1995; stewart et al, 1993). saline was
used as vehicle control (n = 11). a subset of rats in each
group was tested blindly.

cortical spreading depression susceptibility

institutional guidelines for animal care and use for
research purposes were strictly followed, and study
protocol was approved by institutional review board. rats
were anesthetized (isoflurane 5% induction, 1% maintenance, in 70% n2o/30% o2), paralyzed (pancuronium
0.4 mg/kg), and intubated through a tracheostomy for
mechanical ventilation (sar-830; cwe, ardmore, pa,
usa). arterial blood gases and ph were measured every
30 minutes and ventilation adjusted to maintain arterial
pco2 between 35 and 45 mmhg (corning 178; corning, ny,
usa). continuous measurement of blood pressure (powerlab; adinstruments, colorado springs, mo, usa) and
blood sampling were performed through a femoral artery
catheter. rectal temperature was kept at 37.01c±0.11c
using a thermostatic heating pad (fhc, bowdoinham, me,
usa). level of anesthesia was maintained throughout the
experiment to eliminate cardiovascular response to tail
pinch. in all treatment groups, systemic physiological
parameters were within normal range, although mild and
transient blood pressure reductions were observed after
200 mg/kg gabapentin (table 1).
rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame (david kopf
instruments, tujunga, ca, usa) and burr holes were
drilled bilaterally under saline cooling at (mm from
bregma): (1) posterior 7.0, lateral 2.0 (occipital, 1 mm
diameter for kcl application or electrical stimulation); (2)
posterior 5.0, lateral 2.0 (frontoparietal, 0.5 mm diameter
for electrode 1); (3) posterior 3.0, lateral 2.0 (frontal,
0.5 mm diameter for electrode 2). dura overlying the
occipital cortex was gently removed and care was taken
to avoid bleeding. the steady (dc) potential and electrocorticogram were recorded with glass micropipettes filled
with 200 mmol/l nacl, 300 mm below pia (axoprobe-1a;
axon instruments, burlingame, ca, usa). ag/agcl reference electrode was placed subcutaneously in the neck.
after surgical preparation, cortex was allowed to recover
for 15 minutes under saline irrigation. the data were
continuously recorded using a data acquisition system for
off-line analysis (adinstruments).

we assessed csd susceptibility using two independent
methods, kcl or electrical stimulation, as described earlier
(ayata et al, 2006). for kcl-induced csd susceptibility, we
placed a cotton ball (1.5 mm diameter) soaked with 1 mol/l
kcl on the pial surface and kept it moist by placing 5 ml of
the same kcl solution every 15 minutes. the total number
of kcl-induced csds detected at either recording site
during 60 minutes kcl application was counted. in addition, we determined the incidence of propagation failure
between the two recording sites in all treatment
groups, and expressed this as the number of csds failed
to appear at electrode 2 as percent of total csds recorded at
electrode 1. after the end of kcl stimulation, electrical
threshold for csd was determined in the opposite hemisphere by direct cortical stimulation using a stimulator
(grass instruments, west warwick, ri, usa), a constant
current unit (wpi, sarasota, fl, usa), and a bipolar
stimulation electrode placed on the pial surface (400 mm tip
diameter, 1 mm tip separation; fhc). cathodal square
pulses of increasing intensity (100 to 4000 microcoulomb,
mc) were applied at 5-minute intervals by adjusting the
current and duration of stimulus until a csd was observed.
at 1 ma current, pulses of 100, 200, 300, and 400 milliseconds were applied, followed by 2 ma current of
300, 400, and 500 milliseconds. if csd did not occur,
additional stimuli of 3 ma, 400 milliseconds, and 4 ma,
400, 500, 1000 milliseconds were applied. the logarithmic
stepwise escalating stimulation protocol was chosen
for its ability to distinguish group differences in csd
threshold based on our prior experience (ayata et al, 2006).
as previously observed, electrical stimulation threshold
for csd showed more variability compared with the
frequency of csds evoked by topical kcl, which is
often attributed to variations in the stimulus currentdensity geometry between the electrode and the cortex. to
achieve sufficient statistical power with higher
variability, slightly higher number of rats was studied to
determine electrical threshold compared with topical kclinduced csds.

the systemic physiological parameters for each rat were calculated by averaging all measurements throughout an experiment. csd amplitudes are the average
amplitude of all csds evoked during 1 hour topical kcl application. as csd duration and propagation speed tended to differ between the first and subsequent
csds, we measured the duration and propagation speed of only the first csd after topical kcl application. propagation failure was assessed during topical kclinduced repetitive csds.

cathodal stimulation threshold for csd (figure 1a;
table 1), and dose dependently reduced the frequency of csds evoked by topical kcl application by
up to 30% compared with saline-injected rats (figure
1b). gabapentin did not significantly alter the
electrophysiological properties of individual csds,
including the propagation speed and the incidence
of propagation failure between the proximal and
distal recording sites (table 1).

in addition, we calculated csd propagation speed by
dividing the distance (millimeters) between the two
recording electrodes by the csd latency (minutes) between
these sites. the csd amplitude and duration at halfmaximal amplitude were also measured.

statistical analysis
the systemic and electrophysiological data and the
number of csds after topical kcl were compared using
one-way analysis of variance followed by dunnett’s multiple comparisons versus control. electrical stimulation
threshold was analyzed using kruskal–wallis one-way
analysis of variance on ranks, followed by dunn’s multiple
comparisons versus control. data were expressed as
mean±s.d. for systemic physiology, electrophysiology,
and number of kcl-induced csds, or as median (25% to
75% range) for electrical csd threshold.

discussion
these data show a novel inhibitory effect of
gabapentin on csd susceptibility using two independent but complementary experimental paradigms. importantly, csd suppression appeared
within 1 hour after a single intravenous dose,
suggesting that gabapentin may suppress propagating waves of injury depolarizations akin to csd in
stroke, subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage,
and traumatic brain injury patients in the acute
neurocritical care setting. injury depolarizations

worsen tissue outcome presumably through hemodynamic and metabolic mechanisms exacerbating
the energy supply-demand mismatch (hashemi et al,
2009; shin et al, 2006; strong et al, 2007). suppression of injury depolarizations using drugs that
inhibit csd has been beneficial in animal models
of stroke, and anecdotally in the clinical setting
(sakowitz et al, 2009; shin et al, 2006). however,
drugs that acutely inhibit csd (e.g., n-methyl-daspartate receptor antagonists) often have neurological side effects that may limit their clinical usefulness. in that respect, gabapentin, widely used as an
analgesic, adjunct antiepileptic and migraine prophylactic drug, offers an advantage with its highly
favorable safety and tolerability profile. importantly,
however, intravenous administration may be required to rapidly achieve therapeutic plasma levels
and csd suppression.
gabapentin attenuates both the stimulated presynaptic ca2 + influx and the neurotransmitter release
in synaptosomal, brain slice, and neuromuscular
junction preparations (dooley et al, 2007). importantly, attenuation of neurotransmitter release appears to be more marked when release is evoked by
intense stimulation, such as high [k + ]e, rather than
the more physiological stimulation paradigms. during csd, massive elevations in [k + ]e lead to large
uncontrolled glutamate release, which augments
csd induction and propagation. hence, gabapentin
may suppress glutamate release during csd more
potently than during normal neurotransmission, and
by this way reduce csd susceptibility.
gabapentin doses used in this study are clinically
relevant, because they are well within the 50 to
300 mg/kg range that show efficacy in most models of
epilepsy and pain in rats, and only two- to fourfold
higher than the usual human doses. the plasma halflife of gabapentin is b100 minutes in rats compared
with b6 hours in humans (radulovic et al, 1995).
importantly, the inhibitory effect of gabapentin on
presynaptic ca2 + influx and neurotransmitter release
becomes manifest rapidly within 30 minutes of drug
application (van hooft et al, 2002). therapeutically,
maximal antiepileptic effect is achieved within
120 minutes after a single intravenous dose (welty
et al, 1993), whereas maximal analgesic effect is
attained within 30 to 60 minutes after a single
intraperitoneal dose in rodents (hunter et al, 1997).
recent data implicated csd suppression as a final
common mechanism shared by five seemingly
unrelated migraine prophylactic drugs (ayata et al,
2006). here, we provide evidence suggesting that
gabapentin may also use this mechanism. unlike
previously tested drugs, however, gabapentin did not
require chronic treatment to suppress csd. clinical
evidence, albeit limited, supports modest efficacy for
gabapentin in migraine prophylaxis. a gradual
buildup of clinical efficacy has not been reported
for gabapentin in migraine, the obvious constraints of
trial design and reporting to assess onset of clinical
efficacy notwithstanding. nevertheless, in prelimin-

ary studies, we found that a lower dose of gabapentin
(50 mg/kg, orally twice a day) for 5 weeks did not
achieve csd suppression, suggesting that chronic
treatment does not augment gabapentin efficacy (data
not shown).
in summary, gabapentin suppressed csd susceptibility after a single intravenous dose. this may be a
potential mechanism of action of gabapentin in
migraine with aura shared by other migraine prophylactic drugs, and suggest that gabapentin may
have efficacy in brain injury states where spreading
depolarizations worsen tissue outcome (williams
et al, 2006).
