the pendant e-ring moiety of the  xxxd2980xxx  aza-analogue 1 that is a potent inhibitor of microtubule
assembly was modified in order to acquire inhibitory activity of dna  xxxg2312xxx . the monophenolic ana-
logue 2 did not exhibit human  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition, while the ortho-quinone 3 that was obtained by oxida-
tion of 2 inhibited its catalytic activity (decatenation) in a dose-dependent manner and stimulated double strand
dna breaks in supercoiled circular plasmid dna, resulting in the production of linear dna. these results
showed that the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition of the ortho-quinone 3 is due to stabilization of the  xxxg2312xxx -
dna covalent binary complex. on the other hand, the ortho-quinone 3 did not inhibit the relaxation process of
supercoiled dna by topoisomerase i at concentrations up to 400 jm, nor was intercalation observed in unwind-
ing measurements of 3. therefore, the ortho-quinone 3 was shown to be a novel nonintercalative  xxxg2312xxx 
specific inhibitor that stabilizes the cleavable complex. the present results suggest that the 4’-free hydroxyl group
on the e-ring and the sugar moiety on the c-ring are not a prerequisite for  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition by

 xxxd2980xxx  derivatives.

key words

dna topoisomerases, mechanistically divided into two
main classes of types i and ii, are critical enzymes that con-
 xxxd3105xxx  the level of dna supercoiling by catalyzing the passage
of individual dna strands or double strands through one an-
other.) dna topoisomerases are involved in biological
processes of dna metabolism such as replication, transcrip-
tion, recombination and chromosome segregation at mitosis.
therefore, compounds that inhibit these enzymes as the pri-
mary cellular target are of special interest since those are
promising candidates for anticancer drugs.”

etoposide,*?) a dna  xxxg2312xxx  specific inhibitor, is
a semisynthetic lignan derived from  xxxd2980xxx ,” a mi-
crotubule assembly inhibitor isolated from roots of
 xxxd2980xxx  sp. (chart 1). etoposide inhibits topoisomerase
ii by trapping the  xxxg2312xxx -dna covalent binary
complex termed the cleavable complex,” resulting in cell
death. extensive structure—activity relationship studies on
 xxxd2980xxx  derivatives have suggested that the phenolic
4’-hydroxyl group of the pendant e-ring plays a crucial role
in the dna cleavage in which  xxxg2312xxx  is im-
plicated.®

in our continuing studies toward antitumor compounds,”
we have already reported the design and synthesis of
 xxxd2980xxx  aza-analogues 1 and 2." both analogues ex-
hibited potent cytotoxicity against kb cells due to the inhibi-
tion of microtubule assembly, which resulted in arresting

 

dna  xxxg2312xxx ; etoposide;  xxxd2980xxx ;  xxxd2980xxx  aza-analogue; inhibitor; cleavable complex

cells in mitosis. this result allowed us to expect that
 xxxd2980xxx  aza-analogues are also potential topoiso-
merase ii inhibitors. the trimethoxy analogue 1 did not show
 xxxg2312xxx  inhibition, probably due to the lack of the
structural requirement described above. however, no in-
hibitory effect of the monophenolic analogue 2 on the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  was observed at all. this unexpected result led to fur-
ther modification of the e-ring moiety of 2 to the corre-
sponding ortho-quinone 3 to exert the potential ability of the
 xxxd2980xxx  aza-analogues for  xxxg2312xxx  inhibi-
tion.

we report herein the inhibitory effect of the ortho-quinone
3 on human dna  xxxg2312xxx . analogue 3 has been
shown to inhibit  xxxg2312xxx  by stabilizing the dna—
enzyme cleavable complex nonintercalatively as in the case
of etoposide.

the aza-analogue 3 used for measurements of inhibitory ac-
tivity of dna topoisomerases was prepared by  xxxd2738xxx , oxida-
tion of the racemic monophenolic analogue 2 that was de-
rived through treatment of 1 with hbr (chart 2).

the inhibitory effect of analogue 3 on human dna topoi-

the ortho-quinone 3 inhibited the decatenation process of

alytic reaction of  xxxg2312xxx  at concentrations above 25
lim (fig. la, lanes c to e), while decatenated minicircle dna
appears with decreasing amounts of 3 (12.5 and 6.25 um,
lane f and g). its inhibitory activity was compared with those
ef  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors  xxxd168xxx '”) and etoposide
(fig. 1b). under the same conditions, etoposide is found to
require higher amounts for complete inhibition since minicir-
cle dna appears at all concentrations (lanes | to n) though
 xxxd168xxx  shows comparable activity with that of 3 (lanes i to
k). it was suggested that the sugar moiety and the partially
aromatic polycyclic array in etoposide interact with the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  and dna, respectively, during  xxxg2312xxx  pro-
cessing,'') and that the 4’-free hydroxyl group in the e-ring is
essential for dna damage in which the enzyme is impli-
cated. in addition, the catechol analogue corresponding to 3,
which was obtained as a minor product in transformation of
1 to 2, also exhibited  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitory activity that
was comparable to that of 3 (not shown). our data suggest at
least that the sugar moiety at c-4 is not a prerequisite for

due to its strong intercalative ability with dna. however, it was confirmed that un-
winding of relaxed dna by  xxxd168xxx  occurred at concentrations over 25 um. there-
fore, the sc band at lane g was unambiguously due to unwinding of relaxed dna.

cleavage reaction

under experimental. (a) lane a, supercoiled pbr322 plasmid dna alone (no drug, no
enzyme); 6, control (no drug); c to f. 1, 10, 50 and 100 um of ortho-quinone 3. lin:

 xxxg2312xxx  inhibition by  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives,
and that the catechol and ortho-quinone forms for the e-ring
are more essential for the activity than the monophenolic
form.

the topoisomerase i mediated relaxation processing of su-
percoiled puci9 plasmid dna, however, was not inhibited
by the ortho-quinone 3 at all at a concentration range up to
400 um (fig. 2, lanes c to e). supercoiled dna disappears
completely to afford a mixture of relaxed dna topoisomers.
when the relaxation reactions were carried out in the pres-
ence of  xxxd168xxx  which is a  xxxg2312xxx  specific in-
hibitor, unwinding of relaxed dna was observed at 50 um
(fig. 2, lanes g and h) due to the strong intercalative ability
of  xxxd168xxx  with dna.'?) these results reveal that the
ortho-quinone 3 is a nonintercalative dna  xxxg2312xxx 
specific inhibitor. separately from  xxxg2310xxx  me-
diated dna relaxation experiments, dna unwinding assays
for 3 were done according to the procedures described in the
experimental to obtain a result that this ortho-quinone ana-
logue does not intercalate with dna (not shown).

 xxxg2312xxx  mediated dna cleavage many nat-
ural and (semi)synthetic compounds have been reported as
 xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors, most of which can be classified
as inhibitors that trap a covalent binary complex consisting
of dna and the enzyme (the cleavable complex) resulting in
the formation of the putative noncovalent ternary complex.
those compounds are further divided into two classes, inter-
calative and nonintercalative inhibitors, both of which afford
full-length linear dna due to double stranded dna cleavage

vol. 48, no. 4

by treating the ternary complex with a strong protein denatu-
rant and proteinase k. to confirm whether the ortho-quinone
3 may stabilize the cleavable complex, dna cleavage experi-
ments were carried out using supercoiled pbr322 plasmid
dna in the presence of 8 u of  xxxg2312xxx . the agarose
gel photograph in fig. 3 shows effects of the ortho-quinone 3
on the dna processing by topoisomerase ij. formation of
full-length linear dna is enhanced with increasing amounts
of 3 and clearly observed at a concentration of 50 um (lane
e). at the same time, nicked dna that is formed by single
stranded dna breaks accumulates dose-dependently at con-
centrations up to 50 um. the levels of formation of both lin-
ear and nicked dna reach steady states between 50 and
100 um. another dna cleavage experiment where the con-
centration range of 3 was between 10 and 50 um showed that
linear dna was already present at 25 um of 3 (not shown).
these data indicate that the ortho-quinone 3 interferes with
the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium and stabilizes the
covalent binary complex. therefore, the  xxxd2980xxx 
aza-analogue 3 is identified as a nonintercalative dna topoi-
somerase ii specific inhibitor of which the mode of action is
stabilization of the dna-enzyme cleavable complex.

in this study we succeeded in transformation of micro-
tubule assembly inhibitor 1 to  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor 3 by
making slight chemical modifications to the e-ring. this in-
dicates that the e-ring plays a crucial role in affecting biolog-
ical activities of  xxxd2980xxx -related lignans. on the
other hand, it does not appear that functional groups at c-4
are a prerequisite for activities since the ortho-quinone 3 of
the aza-analogues inhibits dna  xxxg2312xxx  though it
lacks a sugar moiety at c-4. in fact, aza-etoposide, which
possesses a sugar moiety at c-4 in addition to the monophe-
nolic e-ring, has been shown to exhibit no dna topoiso-
merase ii inhibition.'?) furthermore, gantchev and hunting
recently reported that the ortho-quinone derivative 4 of
etoposide traps the cleavable complex more effectively than
the parent inhibitor etoposide and suggested that methoxy
groups on the e-ring are not a prerequisite for topoisomerase
ii inhibition.'*) accordingly, the ortho-quinone form for the
e-ring of  xxxd2980xxx -related lignans is most likely to be
associated directly with  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition though
the detailed mechanism of the stabilization of the binary
cleavable complex is still unclear.
