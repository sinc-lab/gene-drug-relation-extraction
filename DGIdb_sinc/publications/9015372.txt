biochemical identification of mitochondrial sulfonylurea receptors has been carried out through binding studies performed with [3h] xxxd2215xxx . the
presence of a single class of low affinity binding sites
for  xxxd2215xxx  in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been found, with a kd of 360 { 48 nm and
bmax of 48 { 7 pmoles/mg in beef heart mitochondria.
 xxxd2215xxx  binding was affected by other sulfonylureas ( xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2206xxx ) but not by potassium
channel openers ( xxxd1868xxx , pinacidil, rp66471). in
both rat liver and beef heart mitochondria adenine
nucleotides (atp, adp, amp) and nucleotide analogs
(triazine dyes) produced large inhibition (from 60 to
80%) of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding. photoaffinity labeling of submitochondrial particles with [125i] xxxd2215xxx  revealed a single specifically labeled
polypeptide band of 28 kda by sds-page that is postulated to be (or to form a part of) the mitochondrial
sulfonylurea receptor. q 1997 academic press

antidiabetic sulfonylureas bind to high affinity receptors (sur) in the plasma membrane of pancreatic
b-cells. this causes a closure of the atp-sensitive k/
(katp) channel [1, 2] and initiates a chain of events
that leads to the exocytotic release of insulin [3]. recently, the pancreatic b-cell sur was cloned [4] and
identified as an element composing, together with a k/
pore, the functional  xxxg1253xxx  [5]. similar channels
are also present in the plasma membrane of smooth,
skeletal and cardiac muscle cells as well as in neurons
[6]. the katp channels are specifically activated by
drugs known as  xxxg1232xxx  openers [7, 8].

a small conductance  xxxg1232xxx , with properties similar to the  xxxg1253xxx  from the plasma
membrane, was described in the inner membrane of
rat liver and beef heart mitochondria (mitokatp channel) [9, 10]. the mitokatp channel was blocked not only
by atp but also by antidiabetic sulfonylureas [9-11]
and activated by some  xxxg1232xxx  openers [1214]. according to the present knowledge, the mitokatp
channel may have a dual physiological function.
firstly, it can maintain potassium homeostasis within
mitochondria and thus control mitochondrial volume
[12]. secondly, potassium uptake upon mitochondrial
energization may partly compensate the electric charge
transfer produced by proton pumping and thus enable
the formation of dph along with dc [15].
to obtain further information about the mitokatp
channel, we have studied [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to
the inner membrane of rat liver and beef heart mitochondria. additionally, through the photoaffinity labeling of beef heart mitochondria with [125i] xxxd2215xxx 
we have identified the putative receptor of mitokatp
(or its subunit).
materials and methods
rat liver mitochondria were prepared from male wistar rats
weighing 200-300 g according to the method of johnson and lardy
[16] using an isolation buffer containing 75 mm sucrose, 225 mm
mannitol, 3 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), and 1 mm egta. beef heart
mitochondria and submitochondrial particles (smp) were prepared
as described previously [17, 18].
binding of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to smp membranes was performed
as follows. for the equilibrium binding assay, smp (300-500 mg protein/ml) were incubated for 60 min. at 47c in 50 mm hepes-naoh
(ph 7.4), with the required concentrations of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (usually 2-3 nm, or as indicated otherwise). incubation was terminated
by rapid filtration through whatman gf/c filters under reduced
pressure, followed by washing with 30 ml of 100 mm nacl, 20 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.4), at 47c. prior to use, the filters were immersed
and further incubated for at least 30 min. in a solution containing
0.5% polyethylenimine-hepes (ph 7.4). after use, the filters were
incubated for 24 h in 5 ml of scintillation cocktail formula 989 (dupont nen, germany), and counted for associated radioactivity. nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 30 mm non-radioac-

tive  xxxd2215xxx . the results of preliminary binding experiments
suggested that specific [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding was not saturated
even  xxxd1891xxx  nm concentration of sulfonylurea. thus, to determine
the apparent kd values, competition experiments were carried out.
competition curves were generated using unlabeled  xxxd2215xxx 
over the concentration range from 3 1 1009 to 3 1 1005 m. these
data were subsequently converted to scatchard plots [19, 21].
photoaffinity labeling of smp with [125i] xxxd2215xxx  was performed as described by the group of lazdunski [21]. the samples were
irradiated by uv light with uv-transilluminator (uvp-upland, ca).
the activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase, a mitochondrial inner membrane marker enzyme, was measured as described by storrie and
madden [22]. protein concentration was determined with the use of
a bio-rad protein-assay-kit, according to bradford [23].
 xxxd2215xxx  was purchased from research biochemicals inc.
(natick, ma), and  xxxd2206xxx  from hoechst (frankfurt am main,
germany). the  xxxg1232xxx  openers used in the present study
were generous gifts from rhone-poulenc rorer, dagenham, uk (rp
66471) and leo pharmaceuticals products, ballerup, denmark
(p1060, p1075). [3h] xxxd2215xxx , with specific activity of 48.5 ci/
mmol, was from dupont nen (dreich, germany). [125i] xxxd2215xxx , with specific activity of 2000 ci/mmol, was from amersham (braunschweig, germany). hydroxyglibenclamide was synthesized as described previously [24]. all other chemicals were of the
highest purity commercially available.

results and discussion
the sensitivity of the mitokatp channel to sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  has been observed both in mitoplasts and in proteoliposomes after partial purification [9, 10]. inhibition of electrogenic potassium influx
(potassium uniport) by atp or  xxxd2215xxx  and other
sulfonylureas was also shown in the intact mitochondria [11, 18, 25]. as the activity of mitokatp was localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the first
step of characterization of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding
to mitochondria was to confirm that the sulfonylurea
binding site is also colocalized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. mitochondria form contact sites between the outer and inner membranes. due to this
property there is a possibility of interaction between
membrane proteins present in two different mitochondrial membranes. for example, it was shown that the
activity of the inner membrane centum-picosiemens
channel was controlled by the benzodiazepine receptor
present in the outer mitochondrial membrane [26].
figure 1a shows a linear correlation (rå0.7), from 24
different rat liver mitochondrial preparations, between
the amount of  xxxd2215xxx  specifically bound to mitochondria and the specific activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase, the marker enzyme of the inner mitochondrial
membrane. moreover, the preparation enriched with
the inner mitochondrial membrane, known as submitochondrial particles (smp), revealed both a higher  xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity and a specific  xxxd2215xxx 
binding when compared with intact mitochondria (figure 1b). these observations suggest that the mitochondrial sulfonylurea binding protein is located, together
with mitokatp channel activity, in the inner mitochondrial membrane. in further studies, to increase the sen-

mitochondrial preparations. (b) comparison of density of  xxxd2215xxx  binding sites and  xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity in mitochondria

as their means { s.d. of triplicate. experiments using smp and
mitochondria were performed from the same preparation.

sitivity of our measurements, smp rather than rat liver
and beef heart mitochondria have been used.
the characteristics of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to
beef heart smp are presented in figure 2. the specific
binding of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  was found to be substantially lower in the presence of increased concentrations
of the unlabeled compound (figure 2). the non-specific
binding was to be defined with 30 mm  xxxd2215xxx .
under these conditions specific binding was estimated
to represent 60 { 8% of the total binding (data not
shown). the data used in the competition curve presented in figure 2 were transformed to generate a
scatchard plot (see figure 2 inset). the plot indicates
a single class of binding sites with a kd of 360 nm and
bmax of 48 pmol/mg of protein. recently, it was reported
[17] that rat liver smp exhibits a somewhat different
 xxxd2215xxx  binding property (kd of 4 mm, bmax of

146 pmol/mg of protein) than presented here. however,
it is also known that both the lipid and protein contents
of these two types of mitochondria are different and
this may strongly influence the binding of amphiphilic
 xxxd2215xxx  even if the same (or very similar) putative receptor is involved. other tested sulfonylureas
were able to displace [3h] xxxd2215xxx  in both rat liver
and beef heart mitochondria (table i). surprisingly,
the sulfonylurea derivative hb699 and  xxxd2206xxx 
were able to inhibit  xxxd2215xxx  binding in rat liver
smp, but not in beef heart smp (data not shown) - this
again points to a difference between these two mitochondrial surs. garlid and co-workers [10] described
the inhibition of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  by  xxxd2215xxx  in a reconstituted system to be in the nanomolar concentration range, and with an ic50 of 62 nm
[10]. this suggested the presence of high-affinity binding sites in the inner mitochondrial membrane. in contrast, during our studies we have exclusively found the
presence of a single class of low-affinity binding sites
for  xxxd2215xxx , in both the inner mitochondrial

membrane from rat liver and beef heart. comparable
results were obtained with [125i] xxxd2215xxx  and this
excludes the possibility that the relatively low specific
radioactivity of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  may prevent detection of a low number of high affinity binding sites (data
not shown).
figure 3 shows the effect of mg2/ on [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to beef heart smp. no significant effect
of magnesium was observed on [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding (figure 3), (ic50 of 270 nm in the absence and ic50
of 590 nm in the presence of 5 mm mgcl2). this again
differs from the results described by garlid’s group for
the inhibition of mitokatp by magnesium in a reconstituted system (compare to reference [10]). the presence
of magnesium caused only an increase in both total
and specific binding of  xxxd2215xxx  (figure 3 inset),
without affecting kd . similar results were obtained
with rat liver smp (data not shown).
figure 4 shows the effect of adenine nucleotides on
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to beef heart smp. both
atp (ic50 å 135 mm) and atp/mg (ic50 å 218 mm) were
able to inhibit  xxxd2215xxx  binding. additionally, 2
mm atp, adp and amp inhibit  xxxd2215xxx  binding
with similar potencies. this result suggests that mitosur is an adenine nucleotide binding protein, similar

comparison of effects exerted by 2 mm atp, adp, and amp on

to that found for the plasma membrane sur [27]. as
about 75% of the smp were estimated to be in an inside-out vesicular form (data not shown) the atp binding site on mitosur must be located on the matrix side
of the inner mitochondrial membrane. at present we
cannot speculate whether this binding site may be related to the inhibition of mitokatp channel by atp.
all  xxxg1232xxx  openers tested at concentrations up to 100 mm were unable to inhibit  xxxd2215xxx 
binding (table i), including the  xxxg1232xxx 
opener rp66471 that has recently been shown to activate potassium influx into mitochondria [13]. this suggests that the mitochondrial  xxxd2215xxx  binding
protein does not represent the entire mitochondrial
 xxxg1253xxx  and, at best, may form only part of a more
complicated functional complex. table i summarizes
the results of substances tested on [3h] xxxd2215xxx 
binding to rat liver and beef heart mitochondria.
photoaffinity labeling of smp membranes with [125i] xxxd2215xxx  was performed in order to identify polypeptides responsible for  xxxd2215xxx  binding (figure
4). the same probe has already been successfully applied for the identification of the plasma membrane
sur [24]. the probe (hydroxyglibenclamide) was synthesized exactly as previously described [24]. its ability
to compete with [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to smp was
verified (ic50 for hydroxyglibenclamide was 1.8 mm)
and this confirms that the same binding site is involved
by both compounds. as lower non-specific binding was
observed for beef heart smp in comparison with rat
liver smp (data not shown) beef heart material was
chosen for further labeling studies. figure 5 shows that
few polypeptides were found labeled with [125i] xxxd2215xxx  but that labeling of only one, with a molecular
weight of 28 kda, was displaced by non radioactive
 xxxd2215xxx  (figure 5, lanes b and d). thus, this
polypeptide is postulated to represent the inner mitochondrial sur.
according to garlid and co-workers, properties of the

rat liver and beef heart mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  are
the same in terms of their interactions with  xxxd2215xxx . our observations reveal that the kd for  xxxd2215xxx  binding to mitochondria from beef heart is by
one order of magnitude lower than that found for rat
liver mitochondria [18]. the discrepancy between our
results and those of the garlid’s group can be explained
by the fact that the interaction of  xxxd2215xxx  with
its target protein is most likely different in the reconstituted system than in the inner mitochondrial membrane, primary due to differences in their lipid composition. in other words, naturally occurring differences in
binding that may come from different surroundings of
the receptor in different native membranes are most
likely bypassed and abolished by the reconstitution
procedure. in fact, in all the studies performed on the
inner mitochondrial membrane preparations (mitoplasts or intact mitochondria)  xxxd2215xxx  has been
used in the concentration range from 5 to 150 mm in
order to inhibit k/ transport [28, 29], what points to
low affinity binding sites as responsible for this inhibition.
to summarize, the equilibrium binding studies point
to the presence of a single class of binding sites for
sulfonylurea in the inner mitochondrial membrane of
rat liver and beef heart mitochondria. the 28 kda polypeptide, identified herewith as a putative mitochondrial sur, may represent a part of a more complex
mitokatp channel.

the gel was dried and kept 7 days in a phosphoimager cassette and
further processed by image quant software. the arrow indicates
location of the band where radioactive  xxxd2215xxx  was displaced

molecular weight markers were used: bovine  xxxg124xxx  (66
kda), egg albumin (45 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29 kda), and  xxxd207xxx  (20 kda).
