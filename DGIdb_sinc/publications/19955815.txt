abstract
background/aim: when patients with chronic hepatitis c
(chc) are treated with interferon (ifn)-based therapy, achieving serum hcv-rna negativity by week 12 (early viral response, evr) is an important predictor of a sustained virologic response. the aim of this study was to clarify whether
changes in ifn- ␣ receptor 2 ( xxxg1138xxx -2) expression by peripheral blood monocytes (mo) and the evr rate differed between patients with genotype 1b and a high viral load showing substitution of amino acid 70 in the core region of hcv
(mutant, n = 20) and patients without this substitution (wild,
n = 23). patients and methods: forty-three chc patients
were studied, and received pegylated ifn plus ribavirin.
 xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo was determined using flow cytometry to measure the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi)
before and up to 28 days after starting therapy. results: the
evr rate of the mutant group was significantly lower than
that of the wild group (35 vs.70%). the mfi of mo was significantly higher in the wild group than in the mutant group

introduction

interferon (ifn) is an essential component of current
treatment for chronic hepatitis c (chc). the most effective therapy available at present is the combination of pegylated (peg)-ifn and ribavirin ( xxxd3111xxx ) [1], and achieving serum hepatitis c virus (hcv)-rna negativity by
week 12 of treatment (early virologic response: evr) is
an important predictor of a sustained virologic response
in chc patients with genotype 1b and a high viral load
[2, 3]. hcv with substitutions of amino acid (aa) 70 in
the core region has been reported to be more difficult to
treat than hcv without aa 70 substitution [4, 5].
the hcv core protein has been reported to interfere
with intracellular ifn signaling [6, 7]. when ifn initiates its intracellular signal transduction pathway,  xxxg1219xxx 
and  xxxg2214xxx  kinases are activated and in turn phosphorylate stat1 and  xxxg2214xxx . association of  xxxg1219xxx  with stat1

initiates phosphorylation of stat1, after which phosphorylated stat1 forms a heterotrimeric complex together with phosphorylated  xxxg2214xxx  and ifn regulatory
 xxxg752xxx . this complex is known as ifn-stimulated gene
(isg) factor 3 (isgf3), and it undergoes translocation to
the nucleus where it binds to ifn-stimulated response
element (isre) and upregulates a large number of isgs
including 2ⴕ,5ⴕoligoadenylate synthetase (2- xxxd2579xxx ) [8–
10].
the effect of aa substitutions in the core region of
hcv on intracellular signal transduction induced by ifn
has not been investigated. since signaling is initiated following the binding of ifn to receptors on the plasma
membrane of target cells, the role of ifn receptors should
also be worth investigating. the type i ifn receptor consists of at least two subunits, which are referred to as  xxxg1138xxx -1 (ifn-␣ receptor) and  xxxg1138xxx -2 (ifn-␣/␤ receptor) [11, 12]. recent studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between hepatic expression of this
receptor and the response of chc patients to ifn [13–
16]. it has also been reported that expression of messenger
rna (mrna) for  xxxg1138xxx -2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is correlated with the hepatic expression of
this mrna [17]. however, determining the level of expression of functional ifn receptors would be more useful, if this was possible.

recently, a rapid flow cytometry method for measuring  xxxg1138xxx -2 in small samples of whole blood has been
established [18], and it can also be used to evaluate
 xxxg1138xxx -2 protein expression by leukocyte subsets [19].
the aim of the present study was to clarify whether
changes in  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by peripheral blood mo
up to day 28 of ifn treatment differed between patients
with substitution of aa 70 in the core region of hcv and
those without this substitution.
patients and methods
the subjects were 43 patients with genotype 1b chc, including
19 men and 24 women ranging (10–90th percentiles) from 41 to 67
(median 56) years of age (table 1). written informed consent for
the study was obtained from each patient. all patients were positive for anti-hcv antibody by a third-generation enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) and for serum hcv-rna quantified by taqman pcr method (roche diagnostics, tokyo, japan;
detection limit 15 iu/ml). serum levels of hcv-rna in the subjects ranged (10–90th percentiles) from 5.8 to 6.7 (median 6.5) log
kilocopies/ml. patients known to be homosexual or intravenous
drug users, those positive for hepatitis b surface antigen (hbs-ag)
or antinuclear antibody, and those with metabolic liver dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction were excluded.
detection of aa substitutions in the hcv core region was performed using the previously reported method [4, 5], and the patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the findings. pa-

tients with substitution of aa 70 in the core region of hcv were
assigned to the mutant group and patients without this substitution were assigned to the wild group.
of the 43 patients, 41 had undergone liver biopsy before combination therapy, and the tissue specimens thus obtained were
graded according to the histology activity index (hai) of knodell
et al. [20], after which the specimens were divided into 3 groups
according to desmet et al. [21]: grade 1 for hai scores of 1–3;
grade 2 for hai scores of 4–8, and grade 3 for hai scores of 9 or
more. the specimens were also divided into 4 groups from stage
1 to stage 4 based on the fibrosis score of desmet et al. [21].
ifn regimens
all patients received ifn therapy after giving informed consent. peg-ifn- ␣-2b (pegintron쏐, schering plough pharmaceutical co. ltd., tokyo, japan) was given intramuscularly for 40 weeks
in a weekly dose adjusted for body weight according to the manufacturer’s instructions (!45 kg = 60 ␮g/dose, 46–60 kg = 80
␮g/dose, 61–75 kg = 100 ␮g/dose, 76–90 kg = 120 ␮g/dose, and
191 kg = 120 ␮g/dose).  xxxd3111xxx  (rebetol쏐, schering plough pharmaceutical co. ltd) was given orally for 48 weeks in daily doses adjusted for body weight according to manufacturer’s instructions
(!60 kg = 600 mg/day, 61–80 kg = 800 mg/day, and 181 kg = 1,000
mg/day).
if serum hcv-rna quantified by pcr was negative in week
12, this was defined as an evr. if serum hcv-rna quantified
by pcr was positive in week 12, this was defined as a non-evr.
assays
blood samples were collected from all patients before and 3, 7,
14, and 28 days after the start of ifn therapy. then  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by peripheral leukocytes was determined using flow cytometry to measure the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) after
staining with anti- xxxg1138xxx -2 antibody, as reported previously
[18].
serum 2- xxxd2579xxx  activity was assessed before and 3, 7, 14, and 28
days after the start of therapy with an ria (eiken immunochemical laboratory, tokyo, japan), that had a detection limit of 10
pmol/dl.
comparisons performed
we investigated the following points: (1) comparison of the
evr rate between the wild and the mutant groups; (2) comparison of  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by peripheral blood mo and serum
2- xxxd2579xxx  levels between the wild and mutant groups before therapy
and also 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after the start of therapy, and (3)
comparison of  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by peripheral blood mo and
serum 2- xxxd2579xxx  levels between the evr and non-evr patients from
the wild and mutant groups before therapy, and also 3, 7, 14, and
28 days after the start of therapy.
statistical analysis
results in table 1 are presented as the median and the 10–90th
percentiles. the ␹2 test was used to compare characteristics between the groups.
data shown in the figures 1–3 are expressed as the mean 8
sd. comparisons between 2 groups were done by the nonparametric mann-whitney test or the ␹2 test. a probability value of
!0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

discussion

it has been reported that hcv core protein influences
ifn signaling in target cells such as hepatocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. however, substitution
of aa 70 in the core region of hcv is not known to affect
intracellular signal transduction by ifn. the present
study demonstrated that  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo in
patients with aa 70 substitution in the core region of hcv
(mutant) was lower than that in patients without aa 70

substitution in the core region (wild). therefore, aa 70
substitution in the hcv core region was suggested to be
associated with reduced  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo and,
to our knowledge, this is the first report of such a finding.
it is impossible to observe serial changes in  xxxg1138xxx -2
expression in the liver after combination therapy with
peg-ifn and  xxxd3111xxx  in chc patients. since hepatic expression of  xxxg1138xxx -2 and its expression by peripheral
blood mononuclear cells are reported to be correlated
[17], it could be valuable to observe serial changes in receptor expression on peripheral blood mo. further, it is
thought that assessing expression of the functional ifn
receptor is more useful than determining expression at
the mrna level. ifn receptor protein located on the cell
membrane is functional, while intracellular receptor protein is not, and flow cytometry makes it possible to determine the amount of a particular receptor protein expressed on the surface of peripheral blood mo in chc
patients.
in the present study,  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by peripheral blood mo was consistently higher in patients without
aa 70 substitution than in those with aa 70 substitution
after the start of combination therapy for hcv, because

a significant difference was obtained except on day 14. in
contrast, serial changes in serum 2- xxxd2579xxx  levels were not
different between the wild and mutant groups throughout the observation period. therefore, it is possible that
aa 70 substitution in the hcv core region influences  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by target cells before and during combination therapy, but not intracellular ifn signaling, in
chc patients with genotype 1b and a high viral load.
in the wild group, the evr rate was a high 70%, and
serial changes in  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo were not
significantly different between the evr and non-evr
patients up to day 28. however, the serum level of 2- xxxd2579xxx ,
which is an antiviral molecule, was higher in the evr
patients. these findings suggested that evr was easier to
obtain if signal transduction by ifn proceeded smoothly
in the target cells. therefore,  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression and
ifn signaling in the target cells might be factors related
to evr in the wild group.
in the mutant group, the evr rate was a low 35%, and
there were no significant differences in the changes in
 xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo and serum 2- xxxd2579xxx  levels between the evr and non-evr patients except on day 3.
these findings suggested that not only  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression but also ifn signaling was downregulated and dis-

chc patients

turbed in the target cells of the mutant group. thus, evr
might be related to factors other than  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression and ifn signaling in the target cells of the mutant
group. although evr is not easy to obtain in the mutant
group, other factors such as ifn-mediated innate and
adaptive immune responses, may play a role in evr patients from this group.
in the present study, we only evaluated  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression and 2- xxxd2579xxx , which is one of final products of intracellular ifn signaling. however, the intracellular ifn
signaling pathway has several molecules, including  xxxg1219xxx ,
stat1, 2, isgf3, and isre, while there are numerous
products of isgs [8, 9]. accordingly, these factors should

be evaluated in chc patients with aa 70 substitution in
the hcv core region during combination therapy with
peg-ifn and  xxxd3111xxx .
in conclusion, flow cytometry showed that aa 70 substitution in the core region of hcv downregulated baseline  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo. after initiating combination therapy, this substitution might interfere with the
induction of  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression by mo and with intracellular signal transduction by ifn. further studies may
lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological
role of  xxxg1138xxx -2 in chc patients with genotype 1b and a
high viral load receiving combination therapy with pegifn and  xxxd3111xxx .
