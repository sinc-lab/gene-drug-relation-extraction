most smokers repeatedly fail in their attempts to stop
smoking because of the addictive nature of the nicotine
in tobacco products. nicotine dependence is probably
mediated through the activation of multiple subtypes
of neuronal  xxxg456xxx  (nachr),
among which the mesolimbic a4b2 subtype has a pivotal
role. here, we discuss the rationale for and the design of
a4b2 nachr partial agonists as novel treatments for
tobacco addiction. such agents are expected to exhibit
a  xxxd2082xxx  by sufficiently stimulating a4b2-nachrmediated dopamine release to reduce craving when
quitting and by inhibiting nicotine reinforcement when
smoking. potent and selective a4b2 nachr partial agonists that exhibit dual agonist and antagonist activity in
preclinical models can be identified. the validity of this
approach is demonstrated by the clinical efficacy of
the a4b2 nachr partial agonist varenicline, which has
significantly better quit rates than do other treatments
and offers a new option for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.
smoking and tobacco addiction
despite broad awareness of the health risks to individuals,
tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality in industrialized countries [1]. globally, tobaccoattributable mortality is projected to increase to 6.4 million
per annum in 2015, and account for 10% of all deaths [2].
currently available treatments for nicotine addiction, including nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) and bupropion
(zyban1), only double the placebo quit rate in clinical trials
[3,4], highlighting the unmet need for more-effective therapies. even a marginal improvement in quit rate compared
with existing therapies will have a significant impact on
both individual wellbeing and the public health burden [5,6].
it is well recognized that smoking is one of the most
difficult addictions to overcome: a result of the combination
of the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and possibly other
substances in tobacco, and the strong behavioral components and environmental cues associated with smoking

[7–9]. cigarettes are particularly addictive because they
are readily available and are extremely efficient at delivering the neuroactive components of tobacco to the brain. in
essence, cigarettes provide, with each inhalation, individualized control over the amount and frequency of nicotine
that is delivered to the brain and, thus, over mesolimbic
dopamine (da) neurotransmission – a crucial element of
the response to addictive substances. the rapid and transient increases in da release in the nucleus accumbens
that inhaled nicotine produces will initiate and sustain
compulsive substance-seeking behavior and drug dependence in humans, as described for other drugs of abuse.
several studies using genetically modified mice in which
the a4 and/or  xxxg221xxx  of the neuronal  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) (box 1) is deleted provide strong
evidence that the nachr containing these subunits is a
key mediator of these nicotinic effects. consequently, the
a4b2 nachr has become a molecular target for the design
of novel smoking-cessation agents, which are the subject of
this article.
although the central role of nicotine in tobacco addiction
is not in debate, it is important to emphasize that this
addiction is the result of changes in multiple neurotransmitter and receptor systems, coupled with environmental
and behavioral secondary reinforcers that support continued smoking. despite significant progress in knowledge of
the dynamics of nachrs, including receptor activation,
desensitization, reactivation and upregulation, the exact
role and complex interactions of these neurobiological
substrates have not yet been satisfactorily unraveled. a
critical evaluation of these underlying mechanisms is
beyond the scope of this discussion (for recent reviews,
see refs [10–13]).
in this article, we focus on the hypothesis that activation
of a4b2 nachrs is central to nicotine dependence and we
discuss the a4b2 nachr as a drug target, addressing the
rationale, design and development of partial agonists of this
receptor subtype as a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.

opportunities for developing more-efficacious treatments for
tobacco addiction. upon smoking, inhaled nicotine enters
the brain within seconds, reaching maximal concentrations
within 2 min [14,15], and acts on nachrs located on da and
gaba neurons in the mesolimbic system in the ventral
tegmental area (vta) (figure 1). nicotine can both activate
and desensitize these receptors, depending on the concentration and duration of exposure (box 1). activation of
nachrs on mesolimbic da neurons leads to da release,
whereas the desensitization of nachrs on gaba neurons is
thought to attenuate the gaba-mediated inhibitory drive.
in addition, nicotine interacts with nachrs on glutamate
neurons that regulate the activity of da and gaba neurons
in the vta. the differential activation and desensitization
of nachr subtypes on these neurons result in stimulated
da release in the nucleus accumbens (figure 1), which
initiates a physiological response that strongly contributes
to the reinforcing effects of nicotine [11,12,16,17].
although nicotine can interact with several nachr
subtypes in the mesolimbic pathway, such as a4-, a6and a7-containing nachrs [18], there is convincing evidence that activation of mesolimbic nachrs containing a4

vol.28 no.7

and/or b2 subunits – either as a4b2 or more complex (a4b2*)
combinations – has a pivotal role in the reinforcing effects
of nicotine. for instance, preclinical studies in transgenic
mice have shown that elimination of either the a4 or b2
subunit attenuates the pharmacological and behavioral
effects of nicotine [19,20], and targeted expression of b2
subunits in the vta of b2-knockout mice reinstates
nicotine-seeking behavior and nicotine-induced da release
[21]. recent clinical evidence that selective partial agonists
of a4b2 nachrs are efficacious smoking-cessation agents
provides further validation of the role of a4b2 nachrs in
tobacco addiction.
between cigarettes, brain nicotine levels gradually
decrease, triggering several processes that contribute to
the cycle of craving and urge to smoke that maintains
nicotine dependence. it is believed that the rapidly recurring
and transitory increases in mesolimbic da levels following
repeated exposure to, and withdrawal from, nicotine transmit salient reward and aversive signals to higher cortical
centers, facilitating the learning and associations that
lead to physical dependence, which is characterized by
both somatic and psychoactive symptoms [7,22–24]. this

box 1. neuronal nachrs: activation and desensitization
neuronal nachrs are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels assembled from five of the 11 different a and b subunits that have
been identified in mammals. they consist of either five a subunits or a
combination of a and b subunits (e.g. a4b2, the predominant subtype
form in the mammalian brain), forming a central ion-conducting
channel. according to the allosteric theory [49,50], these channels can
be open (‘activated’), closed (‘resting’) or desensitized to regulate the
passage of cations across the cell membrane. the transition into and
out of the open mode can be monitored at the level of the individual
receptors or populations of receptors (figure i), using a variety of
electrophysiology, ion flux or imaging methods.
the proportion of receptors in each mode is determined by the
concentration and intrinsic activity of the agonist and by the
duration of agonist binding. in the absence of agonist, the receptors
strongly favor the closed mode, whereas agonist binding shifts the
equilibrium from the closed to the open and desensitized modes. in
the open mode, cations flow down their respective electrochemical
gradients, depolarize the membrane and elicit an excitatory signal

in neurons. however, agonist-bound receptors prefer the desensitized mode; in the continued presence of agonists such as nicotine,
an increasingly greater fraction of receptors will become desensitized over time. for most ligand-gated ion channels, the binding of a
full agonist favors the open mode more strongly than does the
binding of a partial agonist. thus, at a given level of receptor
occupancy, partial agonists enable fewer ions to cross the cell
membrane, resulting in a smaller excitatory signal and less da
release than are caused by full agonists (figure ii). it has been well
established that long-term exposure to nicotine can modify the
function and expression of a4b2 nachrs through diverse mechanisms, including receptor desensitization, posttranslational modifications and receptor upregulation, all of which could have a role in
nicotine addiction [51,52]. for instance, prolonged exposure to low
levels of agonist can desensitize nachrs, resulting in inhibition of
nachr function. consistent with this, it has been shown that, at low
concentrations, (partial) agonists can act as antagonists at a4b2
nachrs [35,53,54].

dynamic array of responses probably contributes to both the
reinforcing effects of nicotine and the craving symptoms
upon smoking cessation, but it is not known exactly how
changes in transmitter release and receptor dynamics interact to cause craving and to suppress craving between
cigarettes and during smoking, respectively.
this article is based on the hypothesis that led to the
development of partial agonists of a4b2 nachrs as effective smoking-cessation agents: that is, that smoking
regulates the rapid increase and decrease in levels of
nicotine in the brain that result in a4b2-nachr-mediated
neurobiological changes that lead to reinforcement and
craving.
why a4b2 nachr partial agonists for smoking
cessation?
given the central role of a4b2 nachrs in the reinforcement
and maintenance of nicotine dependence, modulating the
activity of these receptors would be expected to have
therapeutic benefits. specifically, partial agonists of a4b2
nachrs that enhance the activity of these receptors sufficiently to blunt craving and withdrawal, but without
associated abuse potential, are attractive options. furthermore, high-affinity partial agonists of a4b2 nachrs would
www.sciencedirect.com

have the additional potential benefit of preventing nicotine
from activating a4b2 nachrs, thereby blocking its reinforcing effects. these considerations prompted the search for
ligands that act as partial agonists at the a4b2 subtype of
nachr as novel treatments for smoking cessation.
by definition, partial agonists act as agonists with a
smaller maximal effect at full receptor occupancy than does
the full agonist (i.e. they have lower intrinsic functional
activity). additionally, partial agonists with high binding
affinity act as antagonists of co-administered agonists and
suppress their effects. by mimicking some of the agonist
rewarding effects of nicotine, partial agonists of the a4b2
nachr will, theoretically, relieve craving and withdrawal
when quitting. furthermore, during smoking, the presence
of a partial agonist will reduce reinforcement by diminishing the repetitive nicotine-induced phasic da increases
that are mediated by a4b2 nachrs (figure 2).
in theory, the combination of these effects would
reduce smoking in the short term and could be expected,
over a period of months, to attenuate the salient cues
associated with nicotine-based positive reinforcement,
thus facilitating the extinction of behaviors associated
with smoking and, ultimately, the achievement of longterm abstinence.

(b) a theoretical schematic representation of the pulsatile characteristics of the response (e.g. da release) to fluctuating brain levels of nicotine during smoking and between
cigarettes, and hypothetical pharmacological effects of smoking cessation treatments. (i) cigarette smoking (arrows) produces a rapid increase (smoking) and decrease (not
smoking) in nicotine levels, triggering responses (e.g. changes in da release) that are thought to maintain the cycle of reward and craving. (ii) nrt provides a stable
exposure to nicotine (broken line) that reduces craving (gray area), but cigarette smoking still causes steep increases in nicotine levels and in da release, maintaining its
reinforcing effect. (iii) the use of partial agonists of a4b2 nachrs would provide a stable exposure to a compound with a mild nicotinic effect (broken line) – reducing
craving when not smoking (gray area) and preventing the reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing full activation of a4b2 nachrs by nicotine, thus ‘cutting off’ the peak
responses. this results in comparable effects of a partial agonist in the presence and the absence of nicotine (‘stabilization’ of mesolimbic da release).

agonist and antagonist combinations: a proof of
concept for partial agonists
rational approaches to pharmacotherapy for nicotine
addiction would include direct activation of a4b2 nachrs
with an agonist to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms when quitting, or blockade of a4b2 nachrs with an
antagonist to reduce reinforcement and reward from smoking. the first approach, represented by nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), uses nicotine as an agonist in safe
delivery forms by eliminating the smoke that causes
tobacco-related illnesses. nrt is effective [3] at reducing
craving and withdrawal associated with quitting; however,
www.sciencedirect.com

users are still theoretically able to obtain additional
reinforcement during nrt because of a rapid and steep
rise in nicotine peak levels when smoking during treatment [14] [figure 1b(ii)], coupled with the sensory cues
that further maintain tobacco dependence [8].
the second approach has been exemplified by treatment
with the nonselective nachr antagonist  xxxd2550xxx ,
the use of which was one of the earliest suggestions for
smoking cessation pharmacotherapy [25].  xxxd2550xxx 
reduced subjective nicotine experiences in a dose-dependent manner [26] but produced inconsistent effects, increasing cigarette consumption in some studies, and its side

figure 2. theoretical representation of the differences in functional efficacy of a full agonist (nicotine) and a weak or potent partial agonist, alone and combined with
nicotine. (a) partial agonists have a smaller maximal effect than does the agonist nicotine (i.e. increasing their concentration or exposure does not further increase their
effect). when not smoking, the partial agonist has a mild nicotine-like effect and can relieve craving and withdrawal, dependent on the relative functional efficacy versus
nicotine, the receptor-binding affinity and free levels in the brain. (b) to exert an antagonist effect (i.e. to block the reinforcing effect of nicotine when smoking), a partial
agonist should have high binding affinity and sufficiently free levels in the brain (ceff) to inhibit the effect of nicotine completely, resulting in the same maximal effect as the
partial agonist alone. partial agonists with poor binding affinity and/or low brain penetration have insufficient ceff to be efficacious as an antagonist in vivo.

effects compromised compliance [27]. rose and levin [28]
proposed a combination of these two approaches using the
co-administration of nicotine and  xxxd2550xxx , hypothesizing that an agonist–antagonist mixture, when interacting in an appropriate ratio at a4b2 nachrs, would not only
prevent withdrawal symptoms but also attenuate the
reinforcing effects of nicotine. in initial small clinical trials
using  xxxd2721xxx  and oral  xxxd2550xxx , this
combination achieved higher abstinence rates than did
 xxxd2721xxx  alone [29], providing conceptual validation of the mixed agonist–antagonist approach. however, the major practical challenge of maintaining a
narrow agonist:antagonist ratio while administering two
separate compounds with different pharmacokinetic and
metabolic profiles remained. nevertheless, this experiment defined the clear therapeutic objective of delivering
www.sciencedirect.com

dual agonist–antagonist a4b2-selective action for smoking
cessation. could this be better achieved by combining these
properties into a single molecule (i.e. an a4b2-nachr
partial agonist) [figure 1b(iii)]? such an approach has
the potential to provide an optimal ratio of agonist and
antagonist, avoid the pitfalls associated with managing the
exposure of two separate, nonselective compounds and
achieve an optimized balance of partial agonist activity
and duration of action.

partial agonist of nachrs [30], providing a rationale for its
reported efficacy. direct chemical modifications of  xxxd1792xxx 
did not lead to viable drug candidates (figure 3). although
entirely synthetic variations of the  xxxd1792xxx  [3.3.1]-bicyclic
framework generated a series of compounds with improved
brain penetration and longer half-life, these compounds
exhibited mostly antagonist behavior [31] (figure 3). a
search for novel nicotinic structural motifs with partial
agonist activity uncovered the related [3.2.1]-bicyclic benzazapine (figure 3). although it was reported in the 1970s
to lack opioid activity [32], [3.2.1]-bicyclic benzazapine was
found to be an a4b2 nachr antagonist [33]. further studies showed that, by merging structural elements of other
nicotinic agents, partial agonist profiles could be modified –
ultimately leading to varenicline (figure 3), the first partial nicotinic agonist approved as a therapeutic aid to
smoking cessation [34,35].
another
nicotinic
partial
agonist,
dianicline
(sanofi-aventis: ssr591813) (figure 3), shares several
pharmacological properties with varenicline but has lower
affinity at the a4b2 nachr [36]. only limited clinical data
are available for dianicline, which is in phase iii development (see later).
the discovery and neuropharmacology of a4b2
nachr partial agonists
although the pharmacological characteristics of partial
agonists are easily formulated, the actual identification of
a partial agonist with the desired profile presents a formidable challenge. the characterization of nachr partial agonists became more practical only in the 1990s, with the
application of functional in vitro assays – most notably
patch clamp and fluorescence imaging plate reader (flipr)
methodology – to ion channels expressed in oocytes or
mammalian cell lines. this enabled the evaluation of the
whole spectrum of functional efficacies of partial agonists.
screening strategies to identify compounds with the desired
www.sciencedirect.com

properties of a4b2 nachr partial agonists have been
described [33–36]. figure 4 summarizes a typical screening
strategy – including receptor binding, electrophysiology,
and in vitro and in vivo da-release assays – before the
compound is tested in animal models that can predict efficacy for smoking cessation (box 2). in most of these assays,
exemplified by data for varenicline (figure 4), the effects
of the partial agonist alone and in combination with
nicotine are compared with the effects of nicotine alone.
this provides a measurement of the partial agonist activity
of a compound per se and of its antagonist activity in
the presence of nicotine because potent partial agonists
have comparable effects in the absence and the presence
of nicotine.
the ideal partial agonist has a high binding affinity and
achieves high free levels in the brain because these
parameters determine whether sufficient levels of da
are released to relieve craving and whether the partial
agonist can act as an antagonist of nicotine. with peak
brain levels of 300 nm [15] and a ki for a4b2 nachrs of
2 nm [35], nicotine can readily displace compounds with
either poor binding affinity or low brain concentrations.
the free levels of varenicline in the brain (equivalent to its
free plasma levels of 30 nm) [37] and its high a4b2nachr-binding affinity ki of 0.1 nm [35] are sufficient to
prevent nicotine levels in smokers from fully activating
a4b2 nachrs. however, high-affinity compounds with poor
brain penetration, such as  xxxd1792xxx , or low-affinity compounds such as dianicline [36] might be less effective at
competing with nicotine for a4b2 nachrs and could be
expected to display only agonist activity (i.e. efficacy comparable to nrt), without sufficiently potent antagonist
activity. finally, no clinical data are available regarding
the optimal agonist:antagonist ratio for smoking cessation
treatment but, in our search for partial agonists, we
assumed that 30–70% efficacy relative to nicotine would
provide an optimal range. we reasoned that compounds

box 2. predicting smoking cessation efficacy with animal
models
animal models used in nicotine research [55] can identify compounds
that: (i) animals perceive as being nicotine like; (ii) decrease nicotine
self-administration; (iii) are significantly less reinforcing than nicotine;
and (iv) do not produce withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.
(i) drug discrimination assesses the ability of an animal to detect
the subjective effects of centrally acting drugs (i.e. whether a
test compound feels more like saline or more like a reference
agent, in this case nicotine). because this procedure does not
allow ‘in-between’ responses, partial agonists from various
drug classes can fully substitute for the reference compound, as
has been shown for varenicline [35].
(ii) nicotine self-administration procedures are good translational
models for the reinforcing effects of tobacco [56–58]. intake that
is essentially unrestricted, similar to that of a smoker, can be
observed when nicotine is obtained after a fixed number of
lever presses, enabling animals to establish their own patterns
of intake. acute pretreatment with nicotine agonists (nicotine),
antagonists ( xxxd2550xxx  and erysodine) and partial agonists (varenicline and dianicline) decreases nicotine self-administration by 50% – similar to the effect of substituting saline for
nicotine [35,36,59].
(iii) the reinforcing properties of a compound are assessed by
requiring an increasing number of lever presses (‘raised costs’)
to obtain each subsequent nicotine injection; in this paradigm,
the reinforcement strength is reflected by the effects of
substituting a drug for nicotine. for instance, the substitution
of increasing doses of varenicline significantly increased
responding at only one dose, compared with saline substitution, in contrast to three doses of nicotine [35]. it is important to
note that acute saline substitution for nicotine causes only a
50% reduction in responding, which indicates that some selfadministration is maintained by secondary reinforcements
associated with the self-administration session, such as signaling lights and pump noise (perhaps analogous to the feel of a
cigarette in the hand and other contextual cues associated with
smoking). it takes several sessions of saline substitution for
animals trained to self-administer nicotine to cease leverpressing behavior completely, illustrating the complex nature
of the primary and secondary reinforcing effects of nicotine [60].
(iv) withdrawal symptoms can be assessed by the sudden discontinuation of chronic drug administration and by noting
withdrawal signs, either through observations or through
monitoring disruptions in operant behavior.

[38,39]. two small studies showed that  xxxd2550xxx 
augmented the efficacy of nrt; however, there are no
published data from larger studies confirming these results,
and the combination has not yet become an established

treatment for smoking cessation [29]. interestingly, the
antidepressant bupropion, which is an accepted first-line
pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation [40], has also
recently been shown to have antagonist activity at the
a4b2 nachr [41,42].
a recently published systematic review of clinical data
for partial agonists of nicotinic receptors in smoking cessation [43] included  xxxd1792xxx  and varenicline. a third a4b2
nachr partial agonist, dianicline [36], is – like varenicline
– the product of rational drug design for smoking cessation.
preliminary phase ii data indicated significantly higher
end-of-treatment quit rates than those seen with placebo:
19% and 16% for 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, compared
with 8% for placebo [44]. phase iii clinical trials are in
progress.
 xxxd1792xxx  is available in eastern europe in 1.5-mg
tablets, under the trade name tabex1 (sopharma, sofia,
bulgaria). recommended dosing begins with six tablets
daily, taken every 2 h, tapering to 1–2 tablets daily over 25
days (http://www. xxxd1792xxx .net/41814_packageinsert.phtml).
although most of the clinical trials conducted between
1967 and 1987 do not conform to current standards of
study design and conduct for smoking cessation trials,
the data collectively indicate that  xxxd1792xxx  is effective for
smoking cessation [45]. in pooled data from three randomized placebo-controlled studies (one with long-term followup), self-reported responder rates are approximately twice
those occurring with placebo (table 1), which is similar to
the treatment effect achieved with nrt [3]. it is possible
that the efficacy of  xxxd1792xxx  is limited by poor brain penetration, as discussed earlier.
varenicline (pfizer: cp526555) was taken into full
clinical development because it combined high binding
affinity at a4b2 nachrs and 40–60% partial agonist
activity with good oral bioavailability and predictable
pharmacokinetics (highly absorbed, low plasma protein
binding, almost completely renally excreted as unchanged
varenicline, with an elimination half-life of 24 h [37,46]).
varenicline, as chantixtm, was approved by regulatory
agencies as an aid to smoking cessation treatment in the
usa in may 2006 and, subsequently, as champixtm in
the eu; it has now been approved for marketing in >40
countries. efficacy at smoking cessation has been demonstrated in four clinical trials that followed post-treatment

trials compared 12-week treatment with varenicline (1 mg
twice daily), 150 mg of sustained-release bupropion twice
daily or placebo [47,48]. for varenicline, rates of end-oftreatment smoking cessation [measured as carbon monoxide (co)-confirmed continuous abstinence during the last
four weeks of the treatment period] and long-term abstinence (measured as continued abstinence from the last four
weeks of treatment to the end of one year) were approximately three times those occurring with placebo (table 1)
and 1.5–1.9 times those caused by bupropion [47,48]. compared with placebo, varenicline significantly reduced craving (urge to smoke) and negative effects associated with
nicotine withdrawal. varenicline also reduced smoking
satisfaction, psychological reward and enjoyment of respiratory-tract sensations, as reported by individuals who
smoked during treatment [47,48].
concluding remarks
treatment of tobacco addiction with partial agonists of a4b2
nachrs offers a novel and well-validated pharmacotherapeutic approach. mechanistically, these agents target the
receptors that are believed to mediate the reinforcing effects
of nicotine and, to some extent, mimic the agonist effects of
nicotine sufficiently to reduce craving when quitting.
furthermore, partial agonists with sufficiently high receptor-binding affinity and free concentration in the brain will
act as antagonists in the presence of nicotine, attenuating its
reinforcing effects when smoking. treatment of tobacco
addiction with partial agonists builds on early experiments
with agonist–antagonist combinations and on historical
anecdotal data regarding the moderate effectiveness of
the alkaloid  xxxd1792xxx . this approach has conferred robust
clinical efficacy in the case of varenicline, which is now
marketed as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. this
novel treatment option is a welcome addition to available
pharmacotherapies of nicotine dependence, providing improvement in abstinence rates that should provide a substantial public and individual health benefit.

agora initiative provides free agriculture journals to
developing countries
the health internetwork access to research initiative (hinari) of the who has launched a new
community scheme with the un food and agriculture organization.
as part of this enterprise, elsevier has given hundreds of journals to access to global online
research in agriculture (agora). more than 100 institutions are now registered for the scheme,
which aims to provide developing countries with free access to vital research that will ultimately
help increase crop yields and encourage agricultural self-sufficiency.
according to the africa university in zimbabwe, agora has been welcomed by both students
and staff. ‘‘it has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips’’, says vimbai hungwe. ‘‘the
information made available goes a long way in helping the learning, teaching and research
activities within the university. given the economic hardships we are going through, it couldn’t
have come at a better time.’’
