 xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  represent a new class of
insulin secretagogues, structurally unrelated to sulphonylureas, that were developed for the treatment of type
2 diabetes. the inhibitory effect of these drugs was
investigated on recombinant wild-type and mutant
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels expressed in hek293 cells.
 xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd3098xxx  dose-dependently inhibited
whole-cell  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values of 800 and 21
nmol/l, respectively. mutation of serine 1237 in  xxxg19xxx  to
tyrosine (s1237y) abolished  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  block, suggesting that these drugs share a common
point of interaction on the  xxxg19xxx  subunit of the atpsensitive kⴙ channel. in contrast,  xxxd3098xxx  inhibition
was unaffected by the s1237y mutation (ic50 ⴝ 23
nmol/l). radioligand binding studies revealed a single
high-affinity binding site for [3h] xxxd3098xxx  on membranes prepared from hek293 cells expressing wildtype (equilibrium dissociation constant [kd] ⴝ 0.40
nmol/l) or mutant (kd ⴝ 0.31 nmol/l)  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels.  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  displaced [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding to wild-type channels with ic50 values of
0.7 and 26 ␮mol/l, respectively, but produced <10%
displacement of [3h] xxxd3098xxx  bound to mutant channels. this is consistent with the idea that binding of
 xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx , but not  xxxd3098xxx , is
abolished by the  xxxg19xxx [s1237y] mutation and that the
binding site for  xxxd3098xxx  is not identical to that of
nateglinde/ xxxd3394xxx . these results are discussed in
terms of a conformational analysis of the drug molecules. diabetes 51:2789 –2795, 2002

s

ulphonylureas such as  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes
because they stimulate insulin secretion. their
primary mode of action is to bind to atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels in the pancreatic ␤-cell and induce
their closure (1– 4). katp channels serve a critical role in
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. at low glucose levels,
these channels are open, permitting an efflux of k⫹ ions
that hyperpolarizes the ␤-cell membrane. elevation of

plasma glucose levels potentiates  xxxg2134xxx -mediated glucose uptake into the ␤-cell, and subsequent metabolism of
glucose increases the atp/adp ratio, leading to closure of
katp channels, membrane depolarization, and opening of
voltage-sensitive ca2⫹ channels. the resulting increase in
intracellular ca2⫹ stimulates insulin secretion. sulphonylureas trigger the same series of events by blocking katp
channels directly. katp channels are also found in a variety
of other tissues, including neurons, heart, and skeletal and
smooth muscle cells, where they play important physiological and pathophysiological roles (4).
the ␤-cell  xxxg1253xxx  is a hetero-octameric complex
of four inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx )
subunits, which form a tetrameric pore, and four regulatory sulphonylurea receptor ( xxxg19xxx ) subunits (5,6). sulphonylureas bind with high affinity to  xxxg19xxx  to mediate
closure of the  xxxg1250xxx  pore (7). different sur variants
confer different sensitivities to sulphonylureas and katp
channel openers on the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit; for example,  xxxd3394xxx  inhibits  xxxg19xxx - but not  xxxg20xxx -containing katp channels (8,9). this accounts for the much lower potency of
this drug in tissues such as heart and smooth muscles, in
which katp channels are composed of sur2a and sur2b,
respectively (10,11).
in addition to the classic sulphonylureas, katp channels
are inhibited by benzamido compounds and their derivatives (e.g., meglitinide) (12). this suggests that like other
atp-binding cassette transporters, sur possesses a large
multifaceted drug-binding pocket that can accommodate
several structurally distinct compounds. individual compounds differ in the residues within this pocket, with
which they interact. studies of recombinant katp channels
suggest that drugs containing a sulphonylurea moiety (e.g.,
 xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ) interact with residues in the
tm15-16 linker of  xxxg19xxx  and that a single serine residue
(s1237) within this region is critical for drug binding
and/or transduction (8,13). mutagenesis and affinity-labeling studies also suggest that residues within the cytosolic
loop linking transmembranes (tms) 5 and 6 may be
essential for [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding (14,15). thus,
amino acid residues derived from two distinct regions of
 xxxg19xxx  appear to contribute to the  xxxd2215xxx  binding
site. because  xxxd2215xxx  contains both a sulphonylurea
group and a benzamido moiety, these moieties may interact with different parts of  xxxg19xxx , with the sulphonylurea
moiety interacting with the tm15-16 linker.
the extent to which this model can be applied to drugs
that do not contain a sulphonylurea group remains unclear. recent studies have shown that inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /
2789

interaction of  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  with  xxxg19xxx 

 xxxg19xxx  currents by the nonsulphonylurea  xxxd2654xxx , as
with  xxxd3394xxx , is abolished by the s1237y mutation
(16). this suggests that this residue is not specific for the
sulphonylurea moiety but can interact with other compounds. we therefore explored whether this part of the
drug-binding pocket of  xxxg19xxx  can also accommodate  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx , two members of a new class of
insulin secretagogues termed “prandial glucose regulators.” these drugs differ structurally from the sulphonylureas in that they do not possess a sulphonylurea moiety.
chemically, they are based on  xxxd306xxx  (in the case of
 xxxd3098xxx  [17]) and phenylalanine ( xxxd2702xxx ). both
drugs are known to inhibit  xxxg1253xxx  activity. the
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) for  xxxd2702xxx  inhibition of native rat ␤-cell katp channels (7 ␮mol/l)
(18) lies, as with  xxxd3394xxx , in the low micromolar
range. in contrast,  xxxd3098xxx  resembles  xxxd2215xxx  in
producing high-affinity block of both native and recombinant ␤-cell katp channels (ic50 ⫽ 0.9 –7 nmol/l) (18,19).
our results suggest that  xxxd2702xxx , but not  xxxd3098xxx ,
interacts with serine 1237 of  xxxg19xxx  to mediate inhibition of
the  xxxg1253xxx .
research design and methods
molecular biology. human  xxxg19xxx  cdna (genbank l78207) and human  xxxg1250xxx 
(genbank d50582) were cloned into pcdna3.1(⫺) (invitrogen). the point
mutation  xxxg19xxx [s1237y] was constructed by standard molecular biology
techniques and confirmed by dna sequencing.
cell culture and transfection. hek293 cells were cultured at 37°c in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 in dulbecco’s modified eagles
medium with 4.5 g/l glucose (biowhittaker) supplemented with 10% fcs,
penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml).
transient transfections were performed using fugene 6 transfection
reagent (roche), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. cells were
seeded at 50% confluency and transfected with  xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx [s1237y] at a
plasmid ratio of 1:3 on the next day. cells to be used for electrophysiological
experiments were also cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (gfp) to
enable visual identification of transfected cells. experiments were performed
1–3 days after transfection. hek293 cells stably expressing hkir6.2 and hsur1
were used for studies of wild-type channels (19).
membrane preparation. cells were harvested and centrifuged at 48,000g for
10 min at 4°c. the pellet was homogenized in ice-cold buffer (30 mmol/l
tris-hcl, ph 7.4) using an ultra turrax for 20 s. centrifugation and homogenization were repeated, and the pellet was then resuspended in buffer and
sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mmol/l. protein concentration was measured using the bio-rad protein assay. membranes were stored
at ⫺80°c.
binding experiments with [3h] xxxd3098xxx . binding experiments were
performed in 96-well optiplates (packard). membranes (5 ␮g protein/well for
wild-type channels and 12 ␮g protein/well for mutant channels) were thawed
on ice and incubated for 60 min at 37°c with 0.8 nmol/l [3h] xxxd3098xxx  in 30
mmol/l hepes (ph 7.4), in a total volume of 250 ␮l. bound [3h] xxxd3098xxx 
was separated from free [3h] xxxd3098xxx  by rapid filtration on a filtermate
harvester (packard) through unifilter gf/b filterplates (packard). filterplates were washed five times with 450 ␮l water (room temperature) and
dried. scintillation cocktail (30 ␮l) (microscint, packard) was added to each
well, and radioactivity was determined by counting the plates in a microplate
scintillation and luminescence counter (topcount-ntx; packard). nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 ␮mol/l unlabeled  xxxd3098xxx 
and was ⬍5% of the total binding. binding experiments were performed in
triplicate ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ) or duplicate ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y]).
electrophysiology. whole-cell currents were recorded at 20 –22°c using an
epc9 patch-clamp amplifier and pulse⫹pulsefit version 8.07 software. the
extracellular bath solution contained 140 mmol/l nacl, 5 mmol/l kcl, 10
mmol/l hepes, 1.8 mmol/l cacl2, and 20 mmol/l mannitol (ph 7.4 with naoh).
cells were dialysed with intracellular solution containing 120 mmol/l kcl, 1
mmol/l mgcl2, 5 mmol/l egta, 2 mmol/l cacl2, 20 mmol/l hepes (ph 7.3 with
koh), 0.3 mmol/l k2 atp, and 0.3 mmol/l k2 adp. cells were clamped at ⫺80
mv, and currents were evoked by repetitive 200 ms, 10 mv depolarizing
voltage steps. signals were sampled at 20 khz and filtered at 5 khz. in some
experiments, cells were held at ⫺70 mv for a period of 10 –20 min to study the
2790

time course of drug inhibition. in this case, currents were sampled at 25 hz
and filtered at 6.25 hz.
molecular modeling. conformational analyses were performed using macromodel version 6.0 (20). the compounds were subjected to a monte carlo
search using the mmff force field (21), with a solvation model for water (22).
for each molecule, 5,000 conformations were generated, with an energy
cut-off of 25 kj/mol. the resulting low-energy conformations were imported
into sybyl version 6.6 (tripos, st. louis, mo), and all further manipulations
were performed using this program. initially, a number of alternative superimpositions were generated using the gasp algorithm (23), as implemented in
sybyl. the final pharmacophore models were generated by manually adjusting
the superimpositions generated using gasp. in all cases, the resulting
conformations were compared with the minimum-energy conformations
found in the conformational search.
data analysis. data are presented as mean ⫾ 1 sd unless otherwise stated.
concentration-response curves for drug-induced katp current inhibition were
constructed by expressing the current in the presence of the drug as a fraction
of the current before the drug was added. data were analyzed in prism
(graphpad) using the four-parameter logistic equation:
y⫽a⫹

100 ⫺ a
1 ⫹ 10共log ic50 ⫺ 关l兴 䡠 nh

where y is the current expressed as a percentage of that recorded before drug
was added, a is the percentage of current remaining after maximal inhibition
by the drug, ic50 is the drug concentration that results in half-maximal
inhibition, [l] is the concentration of drug, and nh is the hill coefficient.
the same equation was used to fit the dose-inhibition curves for displacement of [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding, but in this case, y was specific binding and a
was nonspecific binding. the experimentally measured ic50 values for the
competitive ligands were converted into ki values using the cheng-prusoff
equation:

where [l] is the concentration of [3h] xxxd3098xxx , and kd is the equilibrium

chemicals.  xxxd3394xxx  was purchased from sigma and  xxxd2215xxx  from
research biochemicals international.  xxxd2702xxx  was synthesized at novo
nordisk a/s and  xxxd3098xxx  at boehringer ingelheim (biberach, riss, germany). concentrated stock solutions were prepared in dmso for subsequent
dilution in buffer. the concentration of dmso in the experiments did not
exceed 0.1% and had no effect in either binding or electrophysiological
experiments.
radiolabelled  xxxd3098xxx  was prepared at the department of isotope
chemistry, novo nordisk a/s, by catalytic tritiation of the  xxxd3098xxx 
precursor s(⫹)-2-ethoxy-4-[2-[[3-methyl-1-[2-(piperidinyl)-phenyl]4-buten-yl]
amino]2-oxoethyl]- xxxd306xxx  (17), which was kindly provided by dr. m.
mark, boehringer ingelheim. a specific activity of ⬃12 mbq/␮g (144 ci/mmol)
was estimated from mass spectroscopy of the final product.

electrophysiology. whole-cell currents were recorded
from hek293 cells coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx  or
 xxxg19xxx [s1237y]. after establishment of the whole-cell configuration and dialysis with intracellular solution, there
was a gradual increase in both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx [s1237y] currents due to opening of katp channels.
as shown in fig. 1a,  xxxd3394xxx  (300 ␮mol/l) completely
inhibited this katp current (by 93 ⫾ 4%, n ⫽ 4), and the
effect of the drug was reversible upon return to the control
solution. in contrast,  xxxd3394xxx  had very little effect on
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y] currents (fig. 1b).  xxxd2215xxx  (1
␮mol/l) blocked  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels by 98 ⫾ 1% (n ⫽ 3),
and this inhibition could not be reversed by 20 min of
washing (fig. 1a). although  xxxd2215xxx  also inhibited
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y] channels (by 67 ⫾ 6%; n ⫽ 3), in this
case, inhibition was largely reversed on wash-out of the
drug (fig. 1b). these findings are in agreement with earlier
studies of rodent  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels expressed in xenopus oocytes (9).

figure 2 compares the effects of  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  on wild-type and mutant katp channels.  xxxd3098xxx 
(1 ␮mol/l) completely inhibited human  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents (by 98 ⫾ 1%, n ⫽ 5) (fig. 2a), as previously reported
for rat  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  expressed in xenopus oocytes (19). a
similar extent of block was observed for  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx [s1237y] (94 ⫾ 1%, n ⫽ 4) (fig. 2b), suggesting that
s1237 is not required for  xxxd3098xxx  inhibition. in both
cases, no significant recovery of current was observed on
removal of the drug. in contrast,  xxxd2702xxx  (100 ␮mol/l)
produced reversible inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents
(96 ⫾ 2%, n ⫽ 4) (fig. 2a) but was without significant
effect on  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y] channels (fig. 2b).

(18 –28), respectively. these results suggest that s1237 is
not critical for  xxxd3098xxx -induced channel inhibition.
in contrast to  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx  blocked  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  currents with an ic50 of 0.8 ␮mol/l (95% ci 0.3–2.3)
but produced ⬍10% block of the mutant channel, even at
a concentration of 100 ␮mol/l. similar ic50 values were
found for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  expressed in cos-1 cells (24) and
for native rat ␤-cell katp currents (25). this suggests that
the presence of a tyrosine at residue 1237 in  xxxg19xxx  either
prevents  xxxd2702xxx  binding or the transduction of binding
into channel closure.
[3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding experiments. high levels of
specific [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding were observed for membranes prepared from hek293 cells expressing  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  but not for membranes isolated from hek293 cells
expressing the vector only. saturation binding experiments showed that [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding was saturable,
and a scatchard transformation of the data indicated that
binding to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  occurred in an apparent monophasic manner with a high capacity (bmax ⫽ 5.1 ⫾ 1.8 pmol/mg
protein, n ⫽ 5) (fig. 4a). the kd, estimated from nonlinear
regression, was 0.40 ⫾ 0.09 nmol/l (n ⫽ 5). similarly,
binding of [3h] xxxd3098xxx  to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y] revealed a single binding site (fig. 4b) with a kd of 0.31 ⫾
0.02 nmol/l and a bmax of 1.6 ⫾ 0.2 pmol/mg protein (n ⫽
3). thus,  xxxd3098xxx  affinity for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  is unaffected
by mutation of s1237 to tyrosine. the difference observed
in bmax for wild-type and mutant channels is likely to be

versus stable transfection).
attempts to measure [3h] xxxd2702xxx  binding to wildtype or mutant  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  were not successful, possibly
because of the low affinity and rapid unbinding of the drug
(18). we therefore examined the ability of unlabelled
 xxxd2702xxx  to displace [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding to membranes isolated from hek293 cells expressing  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
or  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y]. for comparative purposes, we
also examined the effects of cold  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , and  xxxd3394xxx  on [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding.
all drugs showed a monophasic displacement of
[3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding (fig. 5). the ki for the wild-type
channel, estimated from the ic50 values (see research
design and methods), were 0.6 ⫾ 0.3 nmol/l (n ⫽ 3) for
 xxxd3098xxx , 0.2 ⫾ 0.1 nmol/l (n ⫽ 3) for  xxxd2215xxx ,

close to unity in all cases (from 0.90 to 1.19). the ki for
 xxxd3098xxx  (0.6 ⫾ 0.3 nmol/l) is not significantly different
from the kd estimated from the saturation experiments
(0.40 ⫾ 0.09 nmol/l). furthermore, the relative order of

in the case of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y],  xxxd3098xxx  displaced [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding with a ki of 0.4 ⫾ 0.2 nmol/l
(n ⫽ 3), which is similar to that found for the wild-type
channel. in contrast, the affinity for  xxxd2215xxx  (ki ⫽
36 ⫾ 6 nmol/l, n ⫽ 3) was 170-fold lower than that of the
wild-type channel. furthermore,  xxxd2702xxx  did not displace [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding to the mutant channel, even
at the highest concentration tested (30 ␮mol/l), and  xxxd3394xxx  (300 ␮mol/l) only marginally displaced [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding. the mean results are summarized in table
1. the data are consistent with the idea that the  xxxd2702xxx 
binding, as with that of  xxxd3394xxx , is abolished by the
s1237y mutation in  xxxg19xxx . furthermore, this mutation
reduces the affinity for  xxxd2215xxx  binding while leaving that of  xxxd3098xxx  unaffected.
structural comparison. the fact that s1237 is critical for
 xxxd2702xxx  as well as  xxxd3394xxx  inhibition raises the
question of whether these drugs show structural similarities. we therefore carried out structural comparisons of
 xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd3394xxx 
(fig. 6a).
in agreement with earlier studies (17),  xxxd3098xxx  and
 xxxd2215xxx  can be fitted to the same pharmacophore

superpositioned on the acidic arylsulphonamide part of
 xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 6b). the distal aromatic rings are
copositioned, whereas the carbonyl oxygens of the amide
groups are capable of interacting with the same putative
hydrogen bond donor in  xxxg19xxx . as both molecules are very
flexible, the model shows only one of the several alternative spatial arrangements of the three pharmacophore
groups ( xxxd306xxx /arylsulphonamide, distal aromatic
ring, and carbonyl oxygen).

discussion

the ability of the new insulin secretagogues  xxxd3098xxx 
and  xxxd2702xxx  to inhibit recombinant human  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
channels was investigated and compared with that of
 xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx . structurally,  xxxd2215xxx  consists of a sulphonylurea group similar to
 xxxd3394xxx  and a nonsulphonylurea moiety that resembles the  xxxd306xxx  derivative meglitinide. previous
mutagenesis and affinity-labeling studies have provided
evidence for a model of the  xxxd2215xxx  binding site in
which contributing amino acid residues are derived from
two distinct regions of  xxxg19xxx : the cytosolic loop linking
tms 15 and 16 (in which s1237 is critical) and the cytosolic
loop linking tms 5 and 6 (8,14,15). the tm15-16 loop is
essential for high-affinity inhibition of  xxxg1253xxx  currents by drugs that resemble  xxxd3394xxx  in structure. in
the present study, three different lines of evidence suggest
that  xxxd2702xxx , but not  xxxd3098xxx , interacts with this
region of the channel: binding data, electrophysiological
data, and structural considerations.
binding data. the kd for [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding obtained in this study (0.4 nmol/l) is lower than that reported
for [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding to intact ␤tc3 cells (6.4
nmol/l) (27) but similar to the ki (1.8 nmol/l) found for
 xxxd3098xxx  inhibition of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to rinm5f cells (18). the ki for inhibition of [3h] xxxd3098xxx 
binding to human  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  by  xxxd2702xxx  presented
here (235 nmol/l) is in accordance with that of human
 xxxg19xxx  expressed in cos-1 cells (ic50 ⫽ 280 nmol/l) (24)
and that of native katp channels in hit-t15 cells (ki ⫽ 248
nmol/l [28] or 434 nmol/l [29]) or rin-m5f cells (ki ⫽ 170
nmol/l [18]). in the present study,  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  were found to fully displace [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding
to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels. this suggests that the binding
sites for  xxxd3394xxx / xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd3098xxx  either
overlap or are allosterically coupled.
electrophysiology. mutation of serine 1237 in  xxxg19xxx  to
tyrosine, which is known to influence channel inhibition
by  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  (8), abolished  xxxd2702xxx  but not  xxxd3098xxx  inhibition. this finding is consistent
with the idea that the binding site for  xxxd2702xxx  overlaps
with that of  xxxd3394xxx  and includes residue 1237. in
contrast, the binding site for  xxxd3098xxx  does not include
s1237 (it is unlikely that  xxxd3098xxx  could interact with
s1237 and not be affected by a mutation at this position,
because a serine to a tyrosine represents a rather large
change in side-chain volume).
2793

interaction of  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  with  xxxg19xxx 

 xxxd2215xxx  produced a reversible block of  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx [s1237y]. in previous studies, it was not possible to
detect [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to this channel, a finding
that was suggested to be because the drug rapidly dissociates from sur during the washing procedure of the
binding assay (8). our binding data provide additional
support for this hypothesis. thus,  xxxd2215xxx  displaced
[3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding to the mutant channel with a much
lower potency than for the wild-type channel, consistent
with a larger dissociation rate constant for  xxxd2215xxx 
binding to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y]. the lower binding affinity
of the mutant channel is also consistent with the fact that
1 ␮mol/l  xxxd2215xxx  did not inhibit the channel completely in patch-clamp experiments.  xxxd2702xxx , like  xxxd3394xxx , inhibited wild-type katp currents reversibly. in
contrast,  xxxd3098xxx  inhibition of both wild-type and mutant channels was not reversible. this suggests that the
binding affinity of  xxxd3098xxx  is enhanced by interaction
with additional residues in  xxxg19xxx  and that this interaction
is not disrupted by the s1237y mutation.
the effect of the s1237y mutation on  xxxd2702xxx -induced  xxxg1253xxx  inhibition could be due to either
reduced drug binding or an impaired ability of  xxxg19xxx  to
transduce drug binding into channel closure. however,
because  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx [s1237y] retains the ability to be
blocked fully by  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , the transduction mechanism does not appear to be compromised
by the mutation. (we assume that the transduction mechanism is common for all drugs used in this study.) furthermore, the mutation impairs the ability of  xxxd2702xxx  to
displace [3h] xxxd3098xxx  binding, consistent with a reduced affinity for the former drug.
the residue s1237 is positioned in the intracellular loop
between tm segments 15 and 16. the importance of this
residue for binding and channel inhibition by both  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  strongly argues for an intracellular
binding site for these drugs.  xxxd2702xxx  has been proposed to act from the extracellular side and not to be
internalized into the ␤-cells (30,31). the results presented
here, however, suggest that the binding site for  xxxd2702xxx 
resides on the intracellular side of  xxxg19xxx  and shares at
least one point of interaction with the binding site for
 xxxd3394xxx .
structural comparison. the modeling studies demonstrate that  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3098xxx  can be fit to a
common pharmacophore model, whereas  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , and  xxxd2215xxx  can be fit to another model
that is distinct from that of  xxxd2215xxx / xxxd3098xxx . the
conformations of  xxxd2215xxx  in the two models differ
slightly, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the
large number of conformational degrees of freedom enable  xxxd2215xxx  to adopt a conformation that simultaneously fits both models. most importantly, the structural
investigations illustrate that the acidic moiety is the only
pharmacophore group shared by all four drug molecules.
they further reveal that the amide part of  xxxd2215xxx  is
shared with  xxxd3098xxx , whereas the sulphonylurea part
of  xxxd2215xxx  is shared with both  xxxd3394xxx  and
 xxxd2702xxx . this provides additional support for the idea
that  xxxd2702xxx  shares (at least in part) a common site of
interaction on  xxxg19xxx  with sulphonylureas.
pharmacological relevance. the impact of these obser2794

vations on the efficacy of  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  in
vivo, or in the clinic, is uncertain. however, our data
suggest that the structural determinants involved in  xxxd2702xxx  binding overlap with those of sulphonylureas such
as  xxxd3394xxx . in contrast, the properties of  xxxd3098xxx 
binding and inhibition differ from those of the sulphonylureas. this is of relevance in terms of other known
differences in the mechanism of action of  xxxd3098xxx  and
that of other insulin secretagogues.
in addition to closing katp channels, sulphonylureas
(e.g.,  xxxd3394xxx ) have been shown to interact directly
with the secretory machinery of ␤- and ␣-cells, thereby
stimulating ca2⫹-dependent exocytosis of insulin and glucacon, respectively (32,33). likewise,  xxxd3394xxx  stimulates direct exocytosis of somatostatin and growth
hormone in vitro (34 –36). this has led to the suggestion
that a sulphonylurea binding protein exists on the secretory granules (37,38). it is of interest that  xxxd2702xxx , but
not  xxxd3098xxx , shares the ability to stimulate exocytosis
(34 –36). it is possible, although unproven, that the shared
characteristics of the binding sites for  xxxd2702xxx  and
sulphonylureas, demonstrated in this study, help explain
these differences.
in conclusion, our data indicate that s1237 in  xxxg19xxx  is a
prerequisite for the ability of  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx 
to act as  xxxg1253xxx  inhibitors. in contrast,  xxxd2215xxx  (partially) and  xxxd3098xxx  (wholly) interact with
regions of  xxxg19xxx  that are distinct from s1237.
