 xxxd2614xxx  mechanisms of action and effects on opioid
bowel dysfunction and other opioid adverse effects
chun-su yuan

pioid medications are used extensively as potent analgesics for treating moderate to severe pain. although
opioids offer excellent pain relief, their
use is associated with a number of adverse effects (ades) such as constipation,
nausea, and vomiting. conventional measures for ameliorating opioid-induced
ades are often insufficient. thus, reducing the severity of these ades is of utmost importance for patients who require
the benefits of opioid analgesics. since
opioids mediate their pain-relieving effects and ades through the same classes
of receptors (ie, µ, delta, kappa), it has been challenging to dissociate beneficial effects
from detrimental ones. naloxone, naltrexone, and nalmephene are clinically prescribed opioid antagonists. these nonselective opioid antagonists have been
studied as a means of antagonizing the
undesirable peripheral effects of opioids.
however, because these compounds also
enter the central nervous system, they reverse analgesia or cause opioid withdrawal symptoms.1-4 in the last 3 decades, despite considerable progress in understanding the pharmacologic actions of opioids,
few advances have been made in the
management of these ades. this failure
has led to a search for compounds that
selectively block opioid receptors outside of the central nervous system.

o

objective: to review the mechanisms of action of  xxxd2614xxx  and its
effects on opioid bowel dysfunction, as well as its effects on other opioid-induced
adverse effects (ades), and its potential roles in clinical practice.
data sources:

a literature search using the medline and cochrane collaboration databases for articles published between 1966 and march 2007 was
performed. additional data sources were obtained from manual searches of recent
journal articles, book chapters, and monographs. an updated literature search
showed no additional publications.

study selection and data extraction: abstracts and original preclinical and
clinical research reports published in the english language were identified for
review. review articles, commentaries, and news reports of this compound were
excluded. literature related to opioids, opioid receptors, opioid antagonists,
 xxxd2614xxx , opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, constipation, nausea, and
vomiting was evaluated and selected based on consideration of the support
shown for the proof of concept, mechanistic findings, and timeliness. fifty-eight
original articles from preclinical studies and clinical trials using  xxxd2614xxx 
were identified. pharmacologic action, benefits, and ades of  xxxd2614xxx 
were reviewed, with a focus on its effects on bowel dysfunction after opioids.
emphases were placed on its receptor binding activities and therapeutically
relevant sites of action (peripheral vs central), in which peripheral opioid
receptors in the body contribute to physiological and drug-induced effects.
data synthesis: morphine and related opioids are associated with a number of
limiting ades, including opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.  xxxd2614xxx , a
quaternary derivative of naltrexone, blocks peripheral effects of opioids while
sparing central analgesic effects. it is currently under late-stage clinical investigation
for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness.
reported results showed the drug to be generally well-tolerated. the rapid reversal
of constipation is very encouraging. hastening postoperative discharge may also
be possible.
conclusions:  xxxd2614xxx  has the potential to prevent or treat opioid-induced
peripherally mediated ades on bowel dysfunction without interfering with central
analgesia. the study of  xxxd2614xxx  leads to a greater understanding of the
mechanisms of action of opioid pharmacology.
key words:  xxxd2614xxx , opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, opioid receptors, opioids, peripheral opioid antagonist.

 xxxd2614xxx  is a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist currently under a late stage of clinical development.
traditionally, the introduction of an antagonist has been an
element in the pharmacologic proof of its receptor. the development of selective opioid antagonists such as  xxxd2614xxx  leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of
many opioid effects and may be therapeutically relevant.
this article discusses the effects of  xxxd2614xxx , its potential therapeutic roles in clinical medicine, especially for
opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, and its underlying
mechanisms of action.
data sources
fifty-eight original articles from preclinical studies and
clinical trials using  xxxd2614xxx  were identified via a
literature search using medline and cochrane collaboration databases for articles published between 1966 and
march 2007. abstracts and original preclinical and clinical
research reports published in the english language were
identified for review. review articles, commentaries, and
news reports of this compound were excluded.
 xxxd2614xxx , a peripherally acting opioid
antagonist
 xxxd2614xxx  bromide, or  xxxd2614xxx , is a
quaternary derivative of naltrexone (figure 1).5 the compound is a white, odorless powder, freely soluble in water.
attaching the methyl group to the amine of naltrexone
forms  xxxd2614xxx , a compound with greater polarity
and lower lipid solubility than naltrexone. these properties
inhibit  xxxd2614xxx  from crossing the blood–brain
barrier in humans.5,6
since  xxxd2614xxx  is a peripherally acting opioid
receptor antagonist, studies of this compound provide new
information on the mechanisms of action by which peripheral opioid receptors in the body contribute to physiological and drug-induced actions. using  xxxd2614xxx  as a
probe, previous investigations considered the peripheral
versus central effects of opioids and obtained information
on the action site of opioid effects.
receptor binding studies
 xxxd2614xxx  antagonizes opioid binding at µ-opioid receptors, half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50)
of 70 nm. it has a relatively lower affinity for kappa-opioid receptors (ic50 575 nm), and it does not interact with delta-receptors or orphanin fq receptors. it also does not bind significantly to any nonopioid receptors. in addition,
 xxxd2614xxx  has no intrinsic opioid agonist activity as
measured in standard pharmacologic models of analgesia,
gastrointestinal motility, or in behavioral tests designed to
www.theannals.com

detect substitutes for narcotics.7-9 thus,  xxxd2614xxx 
can be categorized as a pure antagonist.
in the gastrointestinal tract,  xxxd2614xxx  selects µreceptors as demonstrated in isolated gastric-brainstem
preparations from neonatal rats. in this preparation, opioid
agonists produced a marked, dose-dependent decrease in
brainstem neuronal activity when the drugs were applied
solely to the gastric compartment.10  xxxd2614xxx  antagonized the inhibitory effects of morphine and those of the µselective opioid agonist, damgo (trans-3,4-dichloro-nmethyl-n[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide
methanesulfonate hydrate) in a competitive manner, with
ic50 at approximately 300 nm.  xxxd2614xxx  was significantly less (18.8-fold) potent as an antagonist of the kappa-selective agonist, u-50,488h, and it was ineffective against the
delta-selective agonist, dpdpe (d -pen2, d -pen5-enkaphalin)
at tested high concentration.11
opioid-induced gut motility changes
opioid-induced constipation and the site of opioid
actions

the effect of opioids on gastrointestinal motility and
transit is a well-documented clinical phenomenon. opioids
inhibit gastric emptying, decrease propulsive motor activity and the rate of intestinal transit, increase gut fluid reabsorption, and thereby produce constipation.12-14 the inhibitory effect of opioids on the ileocecal sphincter and
defecation reflexes also contributes to opioid-induced constipation.14,15
opioid receptors and endorphins are widely distributed
in the central nervous system and throughout the gastrointestinal tract,16 and an endogenous opioid system may participate at either level in the regulation of gut function, including motility. on the other hand, the dominant site of
effect (central vs peripheral) of exogenous opioid-induced
changes in gut motility or constipation remains a matter of
speculation. morphine may act within the central nervous
system to alter autonomic outflow to the gut.17,18 however,
opioids were shown to affect intestinal motility by a direct
effect on the bowel,19-21 and morphine inhibited primarily
by direct action on gut opioid sites with no significant contribution from a centrally elicited effect.22 these effects appear to be mediated by stimulation of opioid receptors in
the enteric nervous system. it seems likely that different
types of opioid receptors in different anatomical sites affect
gastrointestinal motility and propulsion. the pharmacologic
effects of opioids on gastrointestinal motility are complicated
by species differences. translation of data from previous animal experiments to humans may be problematic because of
differences in the physiology of the opioid systems.
clinical observation of the ades of epidurally administered opioids in humans revealed that constipation is rare,23

implying that the effect of opioids on intestinal motility
and transit in humans is not mediated by spinal opioid receptors. loperamide, an opioid receptor agonist with limited ability to access the brain, is used clinically to treat diarrhea,12 suggesting that opioids have a direct, local constipating effect in humans. it was still unclear, however,
whether the pharmacologic effects of opioid-induced constipation in humans were predominately centrally mediated or peripherally mediated. thus,  xxxd2614xxx  can
be used in clinical trials to test the site of action for the opioid constipating effect and to provide information regarding the mechanisms of action of opioids in humans.
opioid gut activities and tolerance

data from animal experiments show that the gut is very
sensitive to opioids. in the rat, the ratio between subcutaneous analgesic and constipating doses of morphine is approximately 4:1 (ie, 4 times more morphine is needed for
analgesia than for gut effect).24 in orally treated mice, approximately 20 times less morphine is needed to antagonize
castor oil diarrhea than to produce analgesia.25 gut sensitivity to opioids partly explains why constipation is a very severe problem in patients using opioid pain medications.
opioid-induced constipation is seen even with a single
administration of morphine.26 with repeated exposure to
morphine, tolerance does not develop to constipation as it
does to other effects such as analgesia.27,28 tolerance development may be linked to the existence of subtypes of µ-receptors that mediate various pharmacological actions.27,29 it
appears that tolerance develops more readily to µ-1-dependent actions than to non-µ-1-dependent actions. another hypothesis suggests that p-glycoprotein (the drug efflux protein) up-regulation is required for tolerance development.
morphine induces p-glycoprotein up-regulation in the brain,
but it does not up-regulate intestinal p-glycoprotein.30
opioid-induced constipation has been partially attenuated by using different types of opioid compounds or differ-

ent routes of administration or by combining opioids with
other medications.31 however, refractory constipation may
still develop, and thus, opioid antagonists play an important therapeutic role in this respect.
preclinical studies

morphine and other opioids slow normal gut function.16
when  xxxd2614xxx  was administered subcutaneously to
rats, it antagonized the delaying effects of morphine on the
transit time of a charcoal meal through the gut.8  xxxd2614xxx  1, 3, or 10 mg/kg was effective in a dose- dependent manner when given 15 minutes prior to morphine.
 xxxd2614xxx  did not affect morphine analgesia when
administered subcutaneously, although it did reduce analgesia when given intracerebroventricularly.7-9 these findings not only illustrate the ability of  xxxd2614xxx  to
reverse the gut-slowing action of morphine but also suggest that it does not enter the central nervous system in
pharmacologically significant doses. other laboratories
have reported similar findings in rats32 and in horses.33
in isolated guinea-pig ileum and muscle strip preparations of human small intestine,  xxxd2614xxx  reversed
morphine-induced inhibition of contraction, indicating its
direct action on the bowel (figure 2).34 compared with
naloxone,  xxxd2614xxx  had similar effects on morphine-induced inhibition at approximately a tenfold higher
concentration.
interestingly, in the human small intestine preparation,
 xxxd2614xxx  by itself enhanced the force of muscle
contraction by about 30%.34 this observation is supported
by a recent report in which circular smooth muscle strips
from adult horses were used.35  xxxd2614xxx  had a direct effect on the circular smooth muscle of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure that increased contractile activity
in a concentration-related manner. these data suggest the
presence of a background level of endogenous opioid activity in gut tissue.

effects of  xxxd2614xxx  on opioid bowel dysfunction and other opioid ades

opioid receptor antagonists may have prokinetic actions, reversing pathological states of gastrointestinal hypomotility from overactivity of the enteric opioid system.36,37 other investigators have reported that naloxone
might be effective in cases of idiopathic constipation38 and
irritable bowel syndrome.39 if a relative or absolute excess
of endogenous opioids or an altered opioid receptor affinity contributes to hypomotility in chronic gut dysfunction,
 xxxd2614xxx  may have potential as a prokinetic agent
when endogenous opioids in the periphery contribute to
human pathology.
clinical trials

that  xxxd2614xxx  counteracts the gut inhibitory effects of opioids has been demonstrated in a number of clinical studies.40 in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous morphine at
doses of 0.05–0.1 mg/kg delayed oral–cecal transit time as
measured by the lactulose hydrogen breath test.41,42 delay of
gut transit time was significantly prevented (97%) by a single
intravenous injection of  xxxd2614xxx  0.45 mg/kg (p <
0.01).43 the cold-pressor test44 also used in this study demonstrated that  xxxd2614xxx  does not reverse morphine-induced analgesia.43 these data suggest that  xxxd2614xxx 
lacks central activity and that the constipating effect of opioids in humans is predominately peripherally mediated.
in another controlled trial, 22 subjects taking methadone
regularly who experienced opioid-induced constipation
were enrolled.45 for this 2 day study with daily intravenous
 xxxd2614xxx  administration, the effects on laxation,
oral–cecal transit time, and central opioid withdrawal
symptoms were determined. the 11 subjects in the placebo group showed no laxation response, whereas 10 of the

11 subjects in the  xxxd2614xxx  group had an immediate laxation response after intravenous  xxxd2614xxx  (p
< 0.01). in the patients who received  xxxd2614xxx ,
one patient did not defecate on day 1; on day 2, the patient
defecated immediately after a 0.365 mg/kg dose. as shown
in figure 3, baseline (predose) oral–cecal transit times for
subjects in the  xxxd2614xxx  and placebo groups were
mean ± sd, 132.3 ± 36.0 and 126.8 ± 48.3 minutes, respectively. the average decrease in transit time in the  xxxd2614xxx -treated group was significantly greater than in the
placebo group (p < 0.01). no opioid withdrawal was observed in either group, showing that  xxxd2614xxx  is a
peripherally acting opioid antagonist.5,43,46
to date, 2 successful phase iii  xxxd2614xxx  trials
have been completed in 154 and 134 patients with advanced
medical illness and opioid-induced constipation, respectively.
these patients were in hospice or palliative care programs,
and most of them had cancer. patients had a life expectancy
of less than 6 months and had no laxation for 48 hours or
fewer than 3 laxations in the preceding week. for the first
phase iii trial, intent-to-treat, rescue-free results from the
double-blind treatment are shown in table 1.47
similar results were obtained from 133 patients in the second phase iii trial, showing that subcutaneous  xxxd2614xxx  significantly reversed opioid-induced constipation.48
within 4 hours of the first dose, 48.4% of  xxxd2614xxx 
patients versus 15.5% of placebo patients defecated (p <
0.0001). laxation within 4 hours of dosing for at least 2 of
the first 4 doses occurred in 51.6% of  xxxd2614xxx  patients versus 8.5% of placebo patients (p < 0.0001). over
70% of patients had a laxation response within 4 hours after
at least 1 of the first 4 doses of  xxxd2614xxx . for those
who responded to  xxxd2614xxx , the median time to laxation was 30 minutes.  xxxd2614xxx  was well tolerated,
with transient abdominal cramping and flatulence being the most common adverse events.
no opioid withdrawal symptoms or reduction of
opioid analgesic effects were observed in either
trial. these results further demonstrate that
 xxxd2614xxx  is a peripherally active opioid
antagonist and that constipation is predominantly a peripherally mediated mechanism in humans. compared with intravenous injection,
subcutaneous administration is a more convenient route of medication delivery, which can be
self-administered or given by a caregiver.

component of the vomiting sensation; however, it may be
experienced without vomiting. in one report, of the patients
being treated with opioids, 8–35% reported nausea and
14– 40% suffered from vomiting.49,50
opioids act at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (ctz) in
the area postrema of the medulla, triggering emetic mechanisms mediated by the vomiting center in the brainstem
(figure 4). the area postrema is essential for opioid-induced vomiting, as demonstrated by animal studies in
which ablation of the area postrema eliminated the emetic
response to opioids.51,52 the blood–brain barrier in the area
postrema is not complete and thus, pharmacologically, the
area postrema is considered a peripheral compartment.
therefore, opioid antagonists with peripherally restricted
action block the emetic effect of morphine without compromising the analgesic effect.53 delta-receptors may also
partly mediate the emetic response since receptors to
enkephalin (an endogenous delta-opioid receptor agonist)
have been shown in the ctz in dogs.51,54 interestingly, µagonists at high dose and kappa-agonists are antiemetics by acting on the vomiting center downstream from the area
postrema.51,52,55,56
opioids also inhibit gastric motility and delay gastric
emptying, by µ-receptor involvement.57-59 morphine, even
at lower doses, slows gastric emptying in humans.60 like
morphine, delta-agonists also delay gastric emptying.61-64 the
effects of kappa-agonists on gastric emptying are unclear.65-67
overall, the inhibitory gastric effects of opioid agonists
could contribute to nausea and vomiting by activating gas-

trointestinal mechanoreceptors that convey signals to the
vomiting center via the vagal afferents.68 the vagal input to
the vomiting center may be only complementary since
subcutaneous loperamide-induced emesis was not altered
by abdominal vagotomy in ferrets.52
animal studies

dogs are highly susceptible to morphine-induced emesis and have been used as a model of this ade. in dogs,
 xxxd2614xxx  pretreatment by either the intramuscular
or intravenous route antagonized the emetic effects of morphine dose-dependently.53 the emetic effect of morphine
was completely blocked at 0.25 mg/kg given intramuscularly or 0.2 mg/kg given intravenously (p < 0.05) (figure 5).
as mentioned above, µ- and kappa-agonists may act as
antiemetics. to test the hypothesis that morphine has both
peripheral emetic effects and central antiemetic effects,
 xxxd2614xxx  was combined with morphine to unmask
the centrally mediated antiemetic activity of morphine.55 in
that study, coadministration of  xxxd2614xxx  0.25
mg/kg and morphine 1 mg/kg reduced both apomorphineand cisplatin-induced emesis in dogs.
using a rat model of simulated emesis by increasing
kaolin intake, the effect of  xxxd2614xxx  on morphineinduced kaolin consumption was evaluated.69 after the administration of morphine, kaolin intake increased significantly compared with intake in the vehicle control group,
and this increase could be attenuated by ondansetron ad-

exogenous opioids and postoperative ileus
etiology of postoperative ileus

postoperative ileus is characterized by a functional inhibition of the propulsive activity of the intestines after
surgery.70 although postoperative ileus is commonly associated with abdominal surgery, it occurs after other surgeries as well.71,72 an uncomplicated ileus caused by neurohumoral stimulation during surgery resolves spontaneously
in 2–3 days. a more severe form, paralytic postoperative
ileus, lasts for more than 3 days after surgery.73 colonic
motility is crucial for the recovery of bowel function after
surgery, and surgeries involving colonic anastomoses require especially lengthy recovery periods74 with a postoperative stay of 6–12 days.75
it is thought that both endogenous (neurohumoral response) and exogenous (anesthesia, opioids) factors can

contribute to postoperative ileus.73,76 the extent to which
endogenous factors contribute may depend on the level of
pain and the degree of abdominal manipulation.77,78 increased sympathetic activation from the stressful stimulus
of surgery reduces gut motility, which is aggravated by
other gut-related humoral factors, possibly including endogenous opioids,  xxxg2417xxx , substance
p, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and  xxxd2738xxx .73,76
these factors may act simultaneously or during different
phases. the exact mechanisms of action and contribution
of each factor are not clear.
clinical trial

a controlled phase ii trial of intravenous  xxxd2614xxx  was performed in 65 patients who had open segmental
colonic resection.79 patients were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or  xxxd2614xxx  0.3 mg/kg as a 20
minute intravenous infusion every 6 hours after surgery.
patients were treated until 24 hours after they tolerated solid foods, were discharged from the hospital, or for up to 7
full days.  xxxd2614xxx -treated patients recovered bowel function quicker than the placebo group by measures such as first tolerance of

between  xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx  are lacking. µreceptor antagonists not only reverse postsurgical bowel
dysfunction caused by exogenous opioids, but also may reverse the actions of endogenous opioids.73
the cough reflex
coughing is a protective reflex of the airway, especially
necessary in postoperative patients. control of the cough
reflex is thought to reside in the central nervous system,81
but whether peripheral mechanisms contribute to control is
unknown.
in an early study of peripheral agonists conducted in
guinea pigs, a peripheral site of cough action for opioids
was reported.82  xxxd2614xxx  2.0 mg/kg given intraperitoneally blocked morphine-induced cough suppression without affecting antinociception.82 naltrexone, which
is capable of entering the brain, antagonized cough suppression but also reversed morphine-induced analgesia at
doses as low as 0.16 mg/kg given intraperitoneally. in humans, however, intravenous  xxxd2614xxx  did not reverse morphine-induced respiratory depression, a central
opioid effect.83 these studies suggest that peripheral mechanisms control cough and that  xxxd2614xxx  may
maintain the cough reflex in patients who receive opioids.
opioid-induced subjective effects
after opioid administration, troublesome subjective effects (eg, dysphoria, dizziness, nausea, pruritus) have been
reported. not all of these ades, such as nausea and vomiting, are attributed to a central mechanism.84 pruritus also may
be peripherally mediated.85 itching and pruritus caused by
morphine are likely related to the drug’s ability to degranulate mast cells and release histamine.86,87 data from a pilot

clinical trial showed that, in addition to decreasing nausea,
oral  xxxd2614xxx  also decreased itching after morphine was administered to human volunteers.88  xxxd2614xxx  concentrations in plasma at 2 different oral doses
were correlated with the pharmacologic effects of the compound.  xxxd2614xxx  may reduce the peripherally mediated undesirable subjective effects associated with opioid
medications.
summary
the opium poppy may have been used for several thousand years to control diarrhea and relieve pain. a little over
200 years ago, sertürner reported the isolation of morphine, a pure active alkaline substance from opium. morphine and other opioids are widely used in clinical settings,
especially as analgesics to treat moderate to severe pain.
yet, our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of opioids
is still incomplete.
important new tools may permit a better understanding
of the anatomical and pharmacologic targets of opioids in
different body systems.  xxxd2614xxx  is a peripherally
active opioid receptor antagonist. data obtained from animal studies and clinical trials using this novel compound
are advancing our understanding of the sites of a variety of
actions of opioids and allow us to have greater knowledge
of the mechanism of many opioid effects, which may be
therapeutically relevant. further exploration and discussion of the mechanisms of action of  xxxd2614xxx  are
warranted.

metilnaltrexone mediante la búsqueda de literatura. se revisaron la
acción farmacológica, beneficios y efectos adversos de metilnaltrexone
con foco en su efecto sobre la disfunción intestinal inducida por
opiáceos. se enfatizo en la actividad y enlaces de los receptores con sus
sustratos y sus lugares de acción periférico y central para explicar como
contribuyen a los efectos terapéuticos y adversos.
conclusiones: metilnaltrexone tiene el potencial de prevenir o tratar el
efecto periférico inducido por opiáceos de disfunción intestinal sin
interferir con el efecto analgésico central. el estudio de metilnaltrexone
nos lleva a un mayor entendimiento de los mecanismos de acción

résumé
objectif: la morphine et les opioïdes apparentés sont de très répandus
médicaments anti-douleurs associés à un nombre limité d’effets
secondaires, y compris le dysfonctionnement de l’intestin d’origine
opioïde. au cours de 3 dernières décennies, de considérables progrès ont
été effectués dans la compréhension de l’action pharmacologique des
opioïdes. cependant, ces progrès ont fourni peu de nouvelles approches
dans la prise en charge des effets secondaires d’origine opioïde. la
méthyl-naltrexone, un dérivé quaternaire de la naltrexone, bloque les
effets périphériques des opioïdes, tout en épargnant les effets
analgésiques centraux. elle se trouve actuellement en essais cliniques de
phase tardive, et ce dans le traitement de la constipation chez les patients
atteints d’ une maladie avancée. cet article analyse les mécanismes
d’action de la méthyl-naltrexone, ses effets sur le dysfonctionnement de
l’intestin d’origine opioïde, ainsi que les autres effets secondaires
d’origine opioïde et ses rôles potentiels en clinique.
revue de littérature: une recherche bibliographique pour des articles
publiés entre 1966–janvier 2007 a été menée à l’aide des bases de

www.theannals.com

données medline et cochrane. d’additionnelles sources de
références ont été identifiées à l’aide de bibliographies de récents articles
de journaux, de chapitres de livres, et de monographies. une
bibliographie actualisée n’a menée à aucune additionnelle publication.
sélection de l’étude et sélection de l’information: des résumés, et
des rapports originaux de recherches pré-cliniques et clinique publiés en
langue anglaise ont été analysés. des articles d’analyse, des
commentaires, et des rapports d’information ont été exclus de la
sélection. toute bibliographie liée aux opioïdes, aux récepteurs opioïdes,
aux antagonistes opioides, à la methyl-naltrexone, au dysfonctionnement
de l’intestin d’origine opioïde, à la constipation, à la nausée, et aux
vomissements a été analysée et sélectionnée selon des arguments pour
étayer la justification du concept, les résultats mécanistiques, et les
opportunités.
résumé: quarante-huit articles originaux émanant d’études pré-cliniques
et d’essais cliniques avec la méthyl-naltrexone ont été identifiés via une
recherche bibliographique. l’action pharmacologique, les avantages, et
les effets secondaires de la méthyl-naltrexone ont été analysés en
mettant l’accent sur ses effets sur le dysfonctionnement de l’intestin
après l’administration d’opioides. on a principalement tenu compte de
l’activité de liaison au récepteur et des lieux d’actions (périphérique
contre central) thérapeutiquement pertinents dans lesquels, les récepteurs
opioïdes périphériques du corps contribuent à des effets physiologiques
médicamenteux.
conclusions: la méthyl-naltrexone peut prévenir ou traiter les effets
secondaires d’origine périphérique sur le dysfonctionnement de l’intestin
d’origine opioïde sans interférer sur l’analgésie centrale. l’étude de la
méthyl-naltrexone conduit à une meilleure compréhension du
mécanisme d’action de la pharmacologie des opioides.
