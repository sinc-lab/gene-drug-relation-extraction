the metabolic syndrome can be defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance,
central obesity, and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes,
dyslipidemia, premature atherosclerosis, and other diseases.
an increasing body of evidence has linked the metabolic
syndrome to abnormalities in lipid metabolism that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction. we review here the
hypothesis that, in many instances, the cause of these lipid
abnormalities could be a dysregulation of the adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1831xxx )/malonyl
 xxxd1739xxx  (coa) fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism.
such dysregulation could be reflected by isolated increases
in malonyl coa or by concurrent changes in malonyl coa
and  xxxg1831xxx , both of which would alter intracellular fatty
acid partitioning. the possibility is also raised that pharmacological agents and other factors that activate  xxxg1831xxx 
and/or decrease malonyl coa could be therapeutic targets.

ical inactivity are contributing factors, as are incompletely
understood genetic determinants. at a molecular level, abnormalities in cellular lipid metabolism, as reflected by
increases in intracellular triglycerides, are thought to be an
early event (1,2). the importance of the metabolic syndrome stems from the fact it antedates and probably contributes both to the pathogenesis of the many disorders with
which it is associated (3,4) and to the increased incidence of
coronary heart disease that accompanies these disorders (5,6).
in addition, the metabolic syndrome is extremely common: an
estimated 65,000,000 people in the united states are affected,
according to a recent report (7). furthermore, its prevalence is
likely to increase further as obesity and inactivity become more
endemic in younger populations.
an increasing body of evidence has led us to hypothesize
that a common feature underlying the metabolic syndrome
and a target for its therapy, in many instances, could be
dysregulation of the  xxxd81xxx -activated
protein kinase ( xxxg1831xxx )1/malonyl  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) fuelsensing and signaling network (8). as will be discussed
later, such dysregulation could consist of an isolated increase in malonyl coa concentration, an increase in malonyl coa together with a decrease in  xxxg1831xxx  activity, or a
failure of one or both of these molecules to change appropriately in a given setting. the evidence for and against this
hypothesis will be examined in this review.

figure 1: proposed link between the  xxxg1831xxx /malonyl coa fuelsensing and signaling network and the metabolic syndrome. dysregulation of the  xxxg1831xxx /malonyl coa network leads to insulin
resistance, inflammation, and other manifestations of cellular dysfunction that, in turn, predispose to the indicated disorders. in
keeping with this notion, factors that lower the concentration of
malonyl coa and activate  xxxg1831xxx , such as exercise or treatment
with tzds, have shown efficacy in treating the metabolic syndrome. adapted from ruderman and prentki (8).

proposed by randle et al. (9) based on studies in the rat
heart. nearly 30 years later, boden et al. (10) showed that
raising plasma ffa levels during a euglycemic clamp for 4
to 6 hours causes insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle. subsequent studies by many laboratories, most notably
that of shulman (1) and ruderman (4), showed that the
insulin resistance in these individuals was associated with
decreased glucose transport into the muscle cell, abnormalities in insulin signaling, and an increase in intramyocellular
triglyceride. later it was shown that these changes were in
turn associated temporally with 2- to 3-fold increases in the
concentration of diacylglycerol (dag) and activation of
protein kinases c␤ and c␦ (pkcs) and nuclear factor-␬b
(nf-␬b) (11). similar, although not identical, findings in
muscle have been described in rats in which plasma ffas
are elevated during a clamp or insulin resistance is produced
by fat feeding (12–14).
insulin resistance in muscle, even when accompanied by
alterations in intracellular lipid metabolism, can occur in the
absence of an increase in plasma ffas. one example of this
is denervated rat muscle. it had long been known that 24
hours after a sciatic-nerve section, the ability of insulin to
simulate glucose incorporation into glycogen is almost totally inhibited in hind limb muscles of these rats (15). thus,
it was of considerable interest when we found that both
pkc activity and the concentration of the pkc activator,
dag, were increased several-fold in these muscles (16).
furthermore, although the ability of insulin to enhance
glucose incorporation into glycogen was markedly diminished, the stimulation of glucose incorporation into diacyl26s

figure 2: insulin resistance: the lipid theory. according to this
scheme, insulin resistance and other manifestations of cell dysfunction develop when non–␤-oxidation products of  xxxd2154xxx 
metabolism (e.g., fa-coa) increase in the cytosol and this leads to
elevations in dag, oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species),
nf-␬b activation, etc. as depicted, four factors, individually and
collectively, could contribute to this 1) increases in plasma ffa
caused by obesity or lipodystrophy, 2) enhanced de novo synthesis
of cytosolic facoa, 3) inhibition or lack of a compensatory
increase in fa-coa entrance into the mitochondria where they are
oxidized, and 4) an increase in the extramitochondrial mechanisms
leading to dag, reactive oxygen species, etc. an increase in
malonyl coa by inhibiting  xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx  and diminishing fa-coa entrance into mitochondria affects mechanism (3). a decrease in
 xxxg1831xxx  could affect all four mechanisms. not shown in the diagram is that an increased release of certain cytokines from adipose
tissue (tnf-␣, resistin) causes insulin resistance in muscle and
liver, as does a decrease release of another cytokine–adiponectin.
 xxxg1831xxx  activation has been shown to inhibit tnf-␣–mediated
events in vascular endothelium (48). whether it does so in other
tissues or affects the release of the various cytokines from adipose
tissue is not known.

glycerol and other glycerolipids by insulin was increased 2to 3-fold, suggesting a disturbance in fatty acid partitioning.

malonyl coa fuel-sensing and signaling
mechanisms
in searching for a cause of altered fatty acid partitioning
in denervated muscle, our attention turned to malonyl coa.
malonyl coa was originally identified as an intermediate in
the de novo synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx . in the late 1970s,
mcgarry (17) reported that it is also an allosteric inhibitor
of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 ( xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx ), the enzyme that
controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acylcoa (facoa)
from the cytosol into mitochondria, where  xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx  is oxidized. thus, an increase in malonyl coa concentration, by
restraining facoa entrance into mitochondria, could make
more of it available for the synthesis of dag (figure 3). in
keeping with this notion, we found that the concentration of
malonyl coa was increased by 2-fold or more in denervated
rat muscle as early as 8 hours after sciatic nerve sectioning.
conversely, the concentration of malonyl coa was decreased within minutes by exercise (18) or electrically induced muscle contractions (19). concurrent studies re-

figure 4: the malonyl coa fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism
in skeletal muscle. the concentration of malonyl coa is determined by fuel availability and energy expenditure in keeping with
the need for the muscle cell to oxidize  xxxd2154xxx  for atp generation. acc, the fuel sensing element in this system, is regulated
acutely (minutes) by changes in the cytosolic concentration of
citrate (glucose availability), an allosteric activator, and by  xxxg1831xxx 
(exercise), which phosphorylates and inhibits it. chronically, the
regulation of acc by glucose may also be mediated by changes in
 xxxg1831xxx  activity.

figure 3: regulation of malonyl coa in muscle. by inhibiting
 xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx , malonyl-coa, which is derived from glucose, diminishes
fa-coa entrance into mitochondria where they are oxidized. this
makes more cytosolic fa-coa available for tg, dag, and ceramide synthesis, and possibly for lipid peroxidation.  xxxg1831xxx  could
inhibit these events and increase fatty acid oxidation, acutely by
phosphorylating or otherwise inhibiting acc and  xxxg1808xxx  and activating mcd, and chronically by diminishing the expression of
srebp1c and activating pgc1␣ and prar␣ (not shown). in
addition,  xxxg1831xxx  could independently decrease the cytosolic concentrations of fa-coa by inhibiting lipolysis in the fat cell. the
basis for its ability to diminish oxidant stress is not known.
whether  xxxg1831xxx  activation results in enhancement of inhibition of
a process is denoted in the figure by plus and minus signs,

vealed that malonyl coa also plays a central role in
mediating the regulation of fatty acid oxidation by glucose.
thus, in incubated rat muscle, the acute inhibition of fatty
acid oxidation caused by an increase in glucose availability
was associated with an increase in the concentration of
malonyl coa, and the enhancement of fatty acid oxidation
caused by glucose deprivation was accompanied by a decrease in its concentration (19). at a cellular level, these
events were shown to be mediated, at least in part, by
changes in the activity of acetyl coa carboxylase (acc),
the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl coa
(8,20). based on these studies in skeletal muscle, the existence of a malonyl coa fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism was proposed (19,20), in which acc acts as the sensor
and malonyl coa as the signal (figure 4). a similar role for
malonyl coa has been proposed in the pancreatic ␤ cells
(21) and in hypothalamic nuclei (22,23), in which changes
in its concentration have been linked to the regulation by
glucose availability of insulin secretion and food intake,
respectively.

as already noted, by preventing fatty acyl coa from
entering the mitochondria, malonyl coa would theoretically make more of the facoa in the cytosol available for
esterification to dag and triglycerides and other fates that
could lead to insulin resistance (figure 3). in keeping with
this notion, increases in the concentration of malonyl coa
in skeletal muscle (table 1) and, where studied, in liver (24)
have been observed in a wide variety of insulin-resistant
rodents. furthermore, they are typically associated with
increases in dag and triglyceride content and changes in
pkc activity or isoform distribution (24,25). similar
changes in dag, triglycerides, and pkc have been observed in tissues of obese and diabetic insulin-resistant

humans (26,27); however, malonyl coa was not measured.
as reviewed elsewhere (28), the insulin resistance in these
situations has also been associated with inflammatory
changes as evidenced by increases in cellular nf-␬b activation and oxidative stress (29,30).

malonyl coa as a target for treating
insulin resistance
a number of reports suggest that decreasing the concentration of malonyl coa diminishes insulin resistance. thus,
mice in which  xxxg28xxx  (the isoform thought to generate the
malonyl coa that regulates  xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx ) was deleted by homologous recombination are leaner, have less hepatic and muscle lipid, and are more insulin sensitive than control mice.
likewise, the administration of a novel acc inhibitor, cp
040 186, has been shown to diminish ectopic lipid deposition and insulin resistance in fat-fed rats (mice) (31). a
similar effect has been observed in fat-fed rats when malonyl coa decarboxylase is overexpressed in liver (32).

 xxxg1831xxx  regulation and physiology
the acute (minutes) changes in the concentration of malonyl coa observed in skeletal muscle in response to altered
glucose availability have been attributed to increases and
decreases in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, an allosteric activator of acc and a precursor for its substrate
cytosolic acetyl coa (20,21). in contrast, the acute decrease
in malonyl coa caused by exercise and by various hormones (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, glucagon) is secondary to
activation of  xxxg1831xxx , a fuel-sensing enzyme that phosphorylates and inhibits acc (8,33–35).

obesity vol. 14 supplement february 2006

 xxxg1831xxx  was the first kinase shown to respond to changes
in cellular energy state. as recently reviewed (33,34), increases in the amp/atp ratio, such as occur in response to
hypoxia, glucose deprivation in some tissues, and in muscle
exercise, leads to conformational changes in the  xxxg1831xxx 
molecule that make it susceptible to phosphorylation and
activation by an upstream kinase ( xxxg1831xxx ). the activated
 xxxg1831xxx  in turn attempts to restore energy balance by stimulating processes that generate atp (e.g., fatty acid oxidation and in some tissues glucose transport or glycolysis) and
inhibiting others that consume atp, but are not acutely
necessary for survival (e.g., glycerolipid and protein synthesis).  xxxg1831xxx  also seems to protect cells in these settings
by increasing the abundance of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar) ␥ coactivator 1␣ (pgc1␣),
which among its other effects, enhances the expression of
genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative
phosphorylation (36 –38) and increases the expression of
uncoupling proteins ( xxxg2375xxx  and ucp3) (39) that diminish
the generation of superoxide by mitochondria (40). it is
highly likely that a great many additional actions of  xxxg1831xxx 
will be delineated in keeping with its apparently central role
in responding to cellular stresses.

 xxxg1831xxx  as a target for treating insulin
resistance
in addition to exercise,  xxxg1831xxx  is activated by the fat-cell
derived hormones adiponectin and leptin and by two therapeutically used antidiabetic agents, metformin and the thiazolidinediones (tzds) (8). all of these agents, as well as
exercise, have proven useful in treating insulin resistance
(table 2) and other abnormalities associated with the met-

abolic syndrome, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
and endothelial cell dysfunction (table 3). furthermore,
where these agents were studied in intact rodents (41,42)
and in cultured liver cells (43,44) and endothelium (43),
their action paralleled activation of  xxxg1831xxx . conversely,
resistin, a hormone produced by adipocytes in the mouse
and macrophages in humans, causes insulin resistance and
diminishes  xxxg1831xxx  activity in liver, as evidenced by a reversal of these changes in resistin knock-out mice (45).
the most widely used  xxxg1831xxx  activator to date has been
5 aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide riboside (aicar), an
agent that enters the cell and is phosphorylated to form
aicar-p, an amp mimetic. aicar administration in vivo
has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in rat muscle
(46,47) and liver (46). in addition, it inhibits the activation
of nf-␬b and nf-␬b–mediated genes in endothelial cells
incubated with the fatty acid palmitate or the pro-inflammatory cytokine,  xxxg2296xxx  ␣ (tnf-␣) (48).
importantly, these effects were mimicked by infecting the
cells with a constitutively active  xxxg1831xxx -adenovirus, indicating they were not a side effect of the drug. still to be
determined is whether the effects of these agents are pre-

dominantly a reflection of the decrease in malonyl coa
caused by  xxxg1831xxx  or one or more of its other actions (see
figure 3).

depressed  xxxg1831xxx  activity as a cause of
insulin resistance
in addition to being a therapeutic target for the metabolic
syndrome, a decrease in  xxxg1831xxx  may be involved in its
pathogenesis. thus, spontaneous decreases in  xxxg1831xxx  activity have been found in a variety of rodents with aspects of
the metabolic syndrome, including obese insulin-resistant
mice deficient in leptin (ob/ob) (49); rats with functionally
deficient leptin receptors (fa/fa and zdf) (49); the dahl-salt
sensitive rat, a mildly insulin-resistant rodent with hypertriglyceridemia (41); and the  xxxg1181xxx  ko mouse (50), which, as it
ages, becomes obese, glucose intolerant, and hypertriglyceridemic (51) (table 4). the effects of  xxxg1831xxx  activation on
insulin resistance and other parameters has been studied in
a number of these animal models. for instance, treatment
with aicar has been shown to prevent the development of
diabetes and diminish ectopic lipid deposition in liver, musobesity vol. 14 supplement february 2006

cle, and pancreatic ␤ cells of the zdf rat (49). treatment
increases insulin sensitivity, decreases plasma triglycerides,
ffas, and blood pressure, and improves glucose tolerance
in fa/fa rats (52). likewise, treatment of the dahl-salt sensitive rats with pioglitazone increases low hepatic  xxxg1831xxx 
activity to control values or higher and decreases elevated
concentrations of malonyl coa in liver and triglycerides in
plasma (41,53). finally, infusion of the ob/ob mouse with
leptin (54) has recently been reported to activate  xxxg1831xxx  and
increase mitochondrial number in the adipocyte at the same
time it diminishes adipose tissue mass.
decreases in  xxxg1831xxx  activity and insulin resistance have
also been observed in liver and muscle of rats infused with
glucose for 5 hours or more (24). as in other insulinresistant models, increases in malonyl coa and dag content and acc activity are also found. similar changes, as
well as impaired akt activation by insulin, have been observed in incubated muscles (55,56) and cultured hepg2
hepatocytes (44) exposed to an elevated glucose concentration for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. this suggests that such
changes can be attributable to glucose oversupply; however,
it remains to be determined whether hormonal alterations
(insulin, glucagon) play a role in vivo. also of note, the
impaired ability of insulin to activate akt in the hepatocytes
was prevented by coincubating the cells with metformin
(table 2). this effect of the metformin correlated with an
increase in  xxxg1831xxx  activity and was inhibited by infecting
these cells with a dominant negative  xxxg1831xxx -adenovirus and
mimicked by infecting them with a constitutively active
 xxxg1831xxx -adenovirus. thus, it seemed to be mediated by
 xxxg1831xxx .

observed within an hour in rats fed a carbohydrate meal
after a 48-hour fast. in addition, alterations in glycerol
phosphate acyltransferase ( xxxg1808xxx ), malonyl-coa decarboxylase (mcd),  xxxg765xxx  and pgc1␣ were observed
(57), raising the possibility that a decrease in  xxxg1831xxx  mediates many of the metabolic, enzymic, and genetic changes
that characterize the transition between the starved and fed
states in liver.
finally, the mechanism responsible for the decrease in
 xxxg1831xxx  activity in the glucose-infused and starved-refed rat
and in the comparable in vitro models remains to be determined. in muscle incubated with a high concentration of
glucose, no change in creatine phosphate or adenine nucleotides has been reported (56), and, to our knowledge, significant changes in these high-energy phosphate molecules
have not been observed in either liver or muscle during the
starved to fed transition in vivo. if so, novel mechanisms for
regulating  xxxg1831xxx  may be operative in these circumstances.

mitochondrial dysfunction
studies by kelley et al. (58) and petersen et al. (59,60)
have linked insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle to
mitochondrial dysfunction. thus, impaired mitochondrial
function (or diminished mitochondrial number) together
with an increase in muscle triglycerides have been found in
patients with type 2 diabetes (58), elderly individuals (59),
and offspring of diabetic parents (60).  xxxg1831xxx  was not
assayed in these studies; however, it is noteworthy that
 xxxg1831xxx  activation has been shown to increase mitochondrial
biogenesis, at least in part, by increasing the expression of
the transcriptional coactivator, pgc1␣ (8).

genetically modified mice: a conundrum

acknowledgment

if a sustained decrease in  xxxg1831xxx  activity antedates and
contributes to the pathogenesis of altered cellular lipid metabolism and insulin resistance as we have proposed, one
would expect to observe these abnormalities in mice made
deficient in  xxxg1831xxx  by genetic manipulations. however, in
neither mice expressing a muscle-specific dominant-negative  xxxg1831xxx  (61) nor mice globally deficient in either ␣1 or
␣2  xxxg1831xxx  has evidence of insulin resistance in muscle been
observed, although a decrease in voluntary exercise was
noted in the former group (61). whether insulin resistance
and altered cellular lipid metabolism occur at a later time in
either of these mice remains to be determined. in this
context, a decrease in  xxxg1831xxx  activity (phosphorylation) in
muscle and adipose tissue has been observed in lean, normoglycemic  xxxg1181xxx  ko mice at age 3 months (50), but by 9
months of age, these mice were obese, glucose intolerant,
and dyslipidemic (51). interestingly, at age 3 months, the
respiratory exchange ratio of these mice was elevated (0.9
vs. 0.8 in control mice), suggesting decreased fatty acid
oxidation and that their capacity to sustain exercise was
diminished. studies of mitochondria in these mice will be of
interest, because decreases in mitochondrial function and
pgc1␣-mediated gene expression have been reported in
humans with type 2 diabetes and their offspring (36,37,
60,62), as well as in individuals with impaired glucose
tolerance (36,62).
whether overexpressing a constitutively active  xxxg1831xxx  or
diminishing  xxxg1831xxx  activity in vivo by genetic tools other
than those already used (e.g., sirna) affects insulin action,
to our knowledge, has not been reported. in contrast, as
already noted, overexpressing malonyl coa decarboxylase
in liver (using adenovirus) diminishes insulin resistance in
the fat-fed rat (32).

concluding remarks and unanswered
questions
over the past decade,  xxxg1831xxx  and malonyl coa fuelsensing mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation
of insulin secretion (63), the control of food intake at the
level of the hypothalamus (23,64,65), and even tumorigenesis (66). an even larger body of evidence suggests a likely
relationship between the  xxxg1831xxx /malonyl coa fuel-sensing
network and the metabolic syndrome (4,8). whether dysregulation of this network plays a pathogenetic role, is a
target for therapy of this syndrome, or both remains to be
determined. the evidence supporting these possibilities,
although compelling, has been obtained mainly from studies
in rodents and cultured cells, and data from humans are
limited. also, studies in genetically modified mice have not
yet yielded conclusive answers.
