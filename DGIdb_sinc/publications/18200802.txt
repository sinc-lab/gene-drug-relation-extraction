obesity management: update on orlistat.  over the past 20 years obesity has become a worldwide concern of frightening proportion. the world health organization estimates that there are over 400 million obese and over 1.6 billion overweight adults, a figure which is projected to almost double by 2015. this is not a disease restricted to adults - at least 20 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight in 2005 (who 2006). overweight and obesity lead to serious health consequences including coronary artery disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes, heart failure, dyslipidemia, hypertension, reproductive and gastrointestinal cancers, gallstones, fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis and sleep apnea (padwal et al 2003). modest weight loss in the obese of between 5% and 10% of bodyweight is associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk profiles and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (goldstein 1992; avenell et al 2004; padwal and majumdar 2007). orlistat, a gastric and  xxxg1789xxx  inhibitor that reduces dietary fat absorption by approximately 30%, has been approved for use for around ten years (zhi et al 1994; hauptman 2000). there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that orlistat assists weight loss and that it may also have additional benefits. the aim of this review is to provide a brief update on the current literature studying the efficacy, safety and significance of the use of orlistat in clinical practice.
