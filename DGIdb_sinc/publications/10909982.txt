the expression of uncoupling protein (ucp)-3 mrna in
skeletal muscle is dramatically reduced during lactation in mice. the reduction in ucp-3 mrna levels lowers the amount of the ucp-3 protein in skeletal muscle
mitochondria during lactation. spontaneous or abrupt
weaning reverses the downregulation of the ucp-3
mrna but not the reduction in ucp-3 protein levels. in
lactating and virgin mice, however, fasting increases
ucp-3 mrna levels. changes in ucp-3 mrna occur in
parallel with modifications in the levels of free fatty
acids, which are reduced in lactation and are upregulated
due to weaning or fasting. modifications in the energy
nutritional stress of lactating dams achieved by manipulating litter sizes do not influence ucp-3 mrna levels
in skeletal muscle. conversely, when mice are fed a
high-fat diet after parturition, the downregulation of
ucp-3 mrna and ucp-3 protein levels due to lactation
is partially reversed, as is the reduction in serum free
fatty acid levels. treatment of lactating mice with a single injection of  xxxd331xxx , an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar), raises
ucp-3 mrna in skeletal muscle to levels similar to
those in virgin mice. 4-chloro-6-[(2,3-xylidine)-pirimidinylthio] acetic acid (wy-14,643), a specific ligand of
the ppar- subtype, causes the most dramatic increase
in ucp-3 mrna, whereas troglitazone, a specific activator of ppar-, also significantly increases ucp-3
mrna abundance in skeletal muscle of lactating mice.
however, in virgin mice,  xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643
do not significantly affect ucp-3 mrna expression,
whereas troglitazone is at least as effective as it is in lactating dams. it is proposed that the ucp-3 gene is regulated in skeletal muscle during lactation in response to
changes in circulating free  xxxd2154xxx  by mechanisms
involving activation of ppars. the impaired expression
of the ucp-3 gene is consistent with the involvement of

ncoupling protein (ucp)-2 and ucp-3 are 2
recently cloned genes that have a high sequence
homology with the brown adipose tissue ucp-1.
they uncouple oxidative phosphorylation when
transfected into yeast, and, by analogy with ucp-1, they are
considered to be potentially involved in regulatory thermogenesis (1–4). the ucp-2 and ucp-3 genes are located adjacent in a region of human chromosome 11, which coincides
with quantitative trait loci for obesity and type 2 diabetes (5).
the ucp-3 gene has attracted attention due to its preferential
expression in thermogenic tissues, brown fat, and skeletal
muscle in rodents and skeletal muscle in humans. however,
recent studies indicate that the physiological role of ucp-3 as
a mediator of thermogenesis in muscle is quite complex. for
example, ucp-3 mrna abundance is unaltered in situations
of enhanced regulatory thermogenesis in muscle, such as
long-term cold exposure (6), whereas ucp-3 mrna is upregulated in situations of depressed muscle thermogenesis, such
as starvation (7,8). in fact, most of the physiological or pathological situations reported to date in which ucp-3 gene
expression in skeletal muscle is altered (i.e., during instances
of high-fat diets, postnatal development, or streptozotozininduced diabetes) are associated with parallel changes in circulating free  xxxd2154xxx  (9–11).  xxxd2154xxx  themselves have
been reported to upregulate ucp-3 gene expression in muscle (7,12), most likely by activating peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar)- (12), and it has been proposed
that ucp-3 could be specifically involved in the regulation of
the use of lipids as fuel substrates in skeletal muscle.
decreased ucp-3 mrna expression has been described in the
muscle of type 2 diabetic patients (13), a situation associated
with decreased rates of lipid oxidation by skeletal muscle
(14), although other studies did not confirm this finding (15).
moreover, several studies in obese and type 2 diabetic
humans show an association between polymorphisms in the
ucp-3 gene and a reduction in basal lipid oxidation (16,17).

the breeding cycle is a physiological situation associated
with dramatic metabolic adaptations and changes in energy
balance. a major increase in energy requirements occurs during lactation due to the needs of milk production. well-nourished women meet most of the additional energy costs of lactation by increasing food intake, and there is little evidence of
energy-sparing adaptations involving basal metabolic rate or
adaptative thermogenesis (18). however, a reduction in dietinduced thermogenesis has been demonstrated in lactating
women under nutritionally unfavorable conditions (19), and it
has been interpreted as a way to save energy in periods when
food restriction overlaps with a high-energy output because
of lactation. the molecular mechanisms for this adaptation are
not known, but skeletal muscle has been reported to be
involved (20). in rodents, an overall increase in the efficiency
of energy utilization and a reduction in adaptative thermogenesis develop in lactation, even in well-nourished animals
(21). functional atrophy of brown fat, a major thermogenic tissue in rodents, and a reduced expression of the ucp-1 gene
take place during lactation (22,23), and these have been proposed to contribute to energy sparing during this period. lactation is a unique physiological situation in which an adaptative decrease in energy expenditure appears in association
with hyperphagia. this phenomenon also occurs in many
cases of obesity, and lactation constitutes an excellent model
to assess the molecular mechanisms that determine adaptative changes in energy expenditure and inter-organ metabolic
partitioning. during lactation, metabolic adaptations develop
to promote the utilization of metabolic fuels by the mammary
gland. in lactating mothers, glucose and  xxxd2154xxx  are channeled to the mammary gland for the synthesis of milk,
whereas other tissues, including skeletal muscle, reduce their
use of metabolic fuels for oxidation (24).
here, we report that the expression of the ucp-3 gene is
suppressed in the skeletal muscle of lactating mice, even
though ucp-3 mrna expression remains highly sensitive to
induction by physiological (fasting, weaning) or pharmacological (ppar activators) stimuli.

experiments with ppar activators, in which injections were performed at the
beginning of the light cycle and animals were killed 6 h later. the gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus, and tibialis anterior skeletal muscles were
dissected and blood was collected. skeletal muscle from mouse fetuses and
spleen from virgin controls were also obtained for comparative purposes in
immunoblot assays of mitochondrial proteins.
rna isolation and northern blot hybridization. rna from skeletal muscles was prepared using a guanidine thiocyanate method (25). rna (20 µg) was
denatured, electrophoresed on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred
to positively charged membranes (n+; boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany). ethidium bromide (0.2 µg) was added to rna samples to check equal
loading of gels and transfer efficiency. prehybridization and hybridization
were performed at 55°c using 0.25 mol/l na2hpo4 (ph 7.2), 1 mmol/l edta,
20% sds, and 0.5% blocking reagent (boehringer mannheim) solution. blots
were hybridized using as probes the human cdna for ucp-3 (4) and the
mouse cdna for the mitochondrial genome–encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit ii ( xxxg1454xxx ) (26) that was used as a control. the dna probes were labeled
with an [-32p]dctp using a random oligonucleotide-primer method.
hybridization signals were quantified using molecular image system gs-525
(bio-rad, richmond, ca).
immunoblot analysis. mitochondria were isolated from gastrocnemius and
whole skeletal muscle from the legs of fetuses and from adult mouse spleens
(27). samples containing 20 µg mitochondrial protein were mixed with equal
volumes of 2  sds loading buffer, incubated at 90°c for 5 min, and electrophoresed on sds/12%-polyacrylamide gels. proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunological detection was performed using a rabbit affinity-pure ucp-3 antiserum (alpha diagnostic, san
antonio, tx). this antibody was generated against a 17–amino acid peptide
sequence located at the second and third transmembrane domain of human ucp3, showing 71% homology with mouse ucp-3 and no significant homology with
ucp-1 or ucp-2. it was used at a 4-µg/ml dilution, and detection was achieved
using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) detection system (amersham,
amersham, u.k.). as a positive control, 293 cells stably transfected with a tetracycline-inducible (tet-on; clontech, palo alto, ca) construct driving the long
isoform of human ucp-3 (ucp-3l) cdna expression (293-u3 cells) were used
(b. sibille, g.s., f.v., unpublished data). blots were stripped thereafter and
probed with a rabbit antiserum against bovine heart adenine nucleotide
translocase (ant), a gift of dr. g. brandolin (dbms/biochimie, grenoble,
france), which, according to previously established procedures (27), was used
as a control of equal abundance of mitochondrial membrane protein in the samples. the sizes of the proteins detected were estimated using protein molecular-mass standards (bio-rad). quantitation of autoradiographs and ecl signals
was performed by scanning densitometry.
serum free fatty acid levels were quantified using a colorimetric acyl-coa synthase and acyl-coa oxidase-based method (wako chemicals, neuss, germany).
statistical analysis was performed with student’s t test.

animals. adult female swiss mice were used. they were maintained under
standard conditions of illumination (12-h light/dark cycle) and temperature
(21 ± 1°c) and were fed a standard diet composed of 72% (in gross energy) carbohydrate, 6% fat, and 22% protein (b.k. universal, barcelona, spain), unless
otherwise indicated. female mice were mated with adult males, and the day
of pregnancy was determined by the presence of spermatozoa in vaginal
smears. when lactating mice were studied, litter sizes were adjusted at birth
to 10 pups, except when the effects of exceptionally small (4 pups) or large
(18 pups) litters were determined. pregnant (day 19), lactating (days 1, 7, 15,
and 30), abruptly weaned dams (24 h after removal of 15-day lactating pups),
and virgin control mice were studied in basal conditions. the effects of fasting were determined after 24-h suppression of food to 15-day lactating dams
and virgin controls. the effects of a high-fat diet during lactation were
assessed by replacing the standard diet by a diet composed of 36% (in gross
energy) carbohydrate, 42% fat, and 22% protein (harlan teklad, madison, wi)
after parturition, and dams were studied on day 15 of lactation. when indicated,
mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of  xxxd331xxx  (100
µg/g body wt), wy-14,643 (50 µg/g body wt), or troglitazone (100 µg/g body wt)
in 50%  xxxd1896xxx /saline. controls were given equivalent volumes of
the vehicle, and mice were studied 6 h after injections. direct observation and
weighing of litters before and after the injections did not reveal major changes
in lactational performance due to the 6-h treatments. mice were killed by
decapitation at the beginning of the light cycle, except for those mice in

ucp-3 mrna expression in skeletal muscle is suppressed in lactating mice. weaning reverses the downregulation of ucp-3 mrna expression. figure 1 shows
the ucp-3 mrna levels in the gastrocnemius muscle of
female virgin controls, late-pregnant mice, and lactating mice
at different days of lactation. ucp-3 mrna levels were similar in female virgin and late pregnant mice. lactating mice
showed a dramatically lowered expression of ucp-3 mrna,
and, in mid-lactating dams, ucp-3 mrna was hardly
detectable in the conditions of northern blot assays that
allow an optimal detection in virgin controls (fig. 1). the
impairment in ucp-3 mrna expression in mid-lactating mice
was equally observed in other skeletal muscles: ucp-3
mrna levels in tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum
longus muscles from 15-day lactating dams were, respectively, 8 ± 4 and 14 ± 5% of those in the corresponding virgin
controls. the drop in ucp-3 mrna expression in skeletal
muscle occurred suddenly after birth, and, after only 1 day of
lactation, ucp-3 mrna abundance decreases to less than onetenth of that in pregnant dams just before parturition. thirty
days after parturition, when pups had spontaneously substituted milk for standard diet, ucp-3 mrna levels in dams

returned to control values. however, the effects of weaning on
ucp-3 mrna did not require a long duration. when 15-day
lactating dams were abruptly separated from their offspring
for 24 h, ucp-3 mrna abundance was upregulated and
reached levels similar to those of controls. the reduction in
the expression of ucp-3 mrna during lactation and the
upregulation due to weaning occurred in parallel for the 2.5and 2.8-kb mrna species of ucp-3 (fig. 1b). all of these
changes occurred without modifications in the mrna levels
for  xxxg1454xxx , which were used as a control of overall mitochondrial biogenesis.
ucp-3 abundance is reduced in skeletal muscle mitochondria from lactating mice. to assess whether the
reduction in ucp-3 mrna expression results in a decrease
in the relative amount of ucp-3 protein in skeletal muscle
mitochondria from lactating mice, immunoblot assays of
ucp-3 were performed using a specific antibody (see

unpublished data). a significant decrease in ucp-3 protein levels was achieved on days 7 and 15 of lactation, and spontaneously weaned 30-day lactating dams already showed lower
ucp-3 protein levels than those of virgin controls (fig. 2a).
24-h weaning of 15-day lactating dams did not reverse ucp3 protein downregulation, which remained at 44 ± 11% of virgin control values.
effects of fasting on ucp-3 gene expression in skeletal muscle of lactating mice. the effects of 24-h starvation
on ucp-3 mrna in gastrocnemius from virgin and lactating
mice were determined to assess whether the impairment in
ucp-3 mrna expression of lactating mice affects their
response to fasting. fasting of female virgin mice caused a
significant rise in ucp-3 mrna expression (fig. 3), which is
in agreement with previous reports (6,28). although the basal
levels of ucp-3 mrna were very low in lactating dams, after
24 h of fasting, they rose dramatically to similar levels to
those in fasted virgin mice. thus, there was a >50-fold induction of ucp-3 mrna in gastrocnemius from fasted lactating
dams compared with fed lactating controls. the same behavior was observed for extensor digitorum longus and tibialis
anterior muscles (data not shown).  xxxg1454xxx  mrna levels were
essentially unaltered due to fasting in any of the experimental groups. however, the relative content of ucp protein in
mitochondrial preparations of either fasted virgin or fasted
lactating mice, as compared with fed animals, was unaltered:
115 ± 25% in fasted vs. fed virgins and 52 ± 12% in fasting vs.
fed lactating dams.
changes in litter size modify energy nutritional stress in
lactating mice but do not affect ucp-3 mrna expression
in skeletal muscle. as an experimental approach to assess
the role of the nutritional stress during lactation in the ucp-3
gene downregulation in muscle, litter sizes were manipulated. litters were adjusted after birth to a low size (4 pups)
or a high size (18 pups) as a way to decrease or increase,
respectively, the output of milk by lactating dams. this experimental model is known to raise or lower, respectively, nonshivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue thermogenic activity in lactating mothers (29). the impact of litter
size on nutritional stress was revealed by the fact that, on day

15 of lactation, the total weight of the litters consisting of 4
pups was 45.6 ± 1.2 g, 91% of the dam’s body weight, whereas
it was 108.0 ± 3.6 g in litters consisting of 18 pups, 216% of the
dam’s weight. however, ucp-3 mrna expression in skeletal
muscle of dams was not significantly altered by these changes
in litter size. ucp-3 mrna levels in dams nursing small or
large litters were 128 ± 23 and 106 ± 19%, respectively, vs. lactating controls. it is concluded that modulation of overall
energy nutritional stress is not a major determinant of ucp-3
mrna expression during lactation.
a high-fat diet during lactation partially reverses
ucp-3 mrna and ucp-3 protein downregulation in
skeletal muscle. as a second approach to assess the role of
nutrition on ucp-3 gene downregulation in skeletal muscle
during lactation, dams were exposed after parturition to a
high-fat diet and studied at mid-lactation. this treatment
resulted in an average increase in caloric intake of 22.5%
with respect to lactating mice fed a regular high-carbohydrate diet. the weight of pups from 15-day lactating mice fed
a high-fat diet was higher than that of control pups (high-fat
diet 8.43 ± 0.4 g, controls 6.9 ± 0.2 g, p ≤ 0.05), thus indicating the impact of this dietary treatment on the amount of
energy delivered as milk by lactating dams. ucp-3 mrna levels in skeletal muscle of mid-lactating dams fed the high-fat
diet were significantly higher (451 ± 59%, p ≤ 0.05) than midlactating mice fed a regular diet, although they did not reach
the levels found in virgin controls. similar behavior was
observed for ucp-3 protein: the relative concentration in
lactating dams fed the high-fat diet was higher (164 ± 21%, p ≤
0.05) than that in lactating dams fed a regular diet.

finding is in agreement with previous reports (30). both 24 h
after abrupt weaning of mid-lactating dams or after spontaneous weaning (day 30 of lactation), serum free fatty acid levels rose to levels that were not significantly different from
those in virgin controls. fasting induced a rise in serum free
fatty acid concentrations in virgin and mid-lactating mice. litter size had no effect on serum free  xxxd2154xxx . feeding dams
a high-fat diet during lactation resulted in levels of serum free
 xxxd2154xxx  higher than those in lactating dams fed a regular
diet. in conclusion, there was a close positive association
between changes in serum free fatty acid levels elicited by lactation and nutritional manipulations and changes in ucp-3
mrna levels in skeletal muscle.
differential effects of fibrates and troglitazone on
ucp-3 mrna expression in skeletal muscle of lactating
mice. the present results suggest that free  xxxd2154xxx  may be
responsible for adaptative changes in ucp-3 gene expression
in skeletal muscle during lactation, and we have reported
recently that fibrates, which are activators of ppar, may
mediate free fatty acid effects on the ucp-3 gene (12). the
effects of single injections of the hypolipidemic drug  xxxd331xxx , a preferential ppar- activator (31), wy-14,643, a
highly specific activator of ppar- (32), and troglitazone, a
thiazolidinedione specific for ppar- (33), were studied in
mid-lactating mice (fig. 4).  xxxd331xxx  or wy-14,643 administration did not significantly alter ucp-3 mrna expression
in skeletal muscle of virgin mice, whereas troglitazone
induced it. when injected into lactating mice,  xxxd331xxx 
induced ucp-3 mrna levels and almost reversed the downregulation of ucp-3 gene expression in lactation. wy-14,643
caused the most dramatic increase in ucp-3 mrna abundance in lactating dams, which achieved levels even higher
than those in virgin controls. troglitazone increased ucp-3
mrna expression in skeletal muscle of lactating mice to a
similar extent as that in virgin mice (3- to 4-fold induction in
comparison with vehicle-injected lactating mice). the acute

injections with the ppar activators did not significantly modify serum nonesterified fatty acid levels in either virgin or lactating mice (data not shown).
unaltered ppar- mrna expression in skeletal muscle
of lactating mice. considering the different sensitivity to
fibrates and particularly to ppar-–specific activation in virgin and lactating mice, ppar- gene expression in skeletal
muscle of lactating mice was determined in comparison with
virgin controls. northern blot analysis showed that ppar-
gene was expressed in mouse skeletal muscle as a single transcript of 8.5 kb, as already reported (12). no difference was
observed in the levels of ppar- mrna expression in gastrocnemius skeletal muscle between virgin and 15-day lactating
mice. densitometric scanning of 4 independent northern blot
assays indicated that ppar- mrna signals in mid-lactating
mice was 92 ± 28% of those found in virgin controls.
discussion

in the present study, a dramatic reduction in ucp-3 mrna
expression resulting in a decrease in the relative abundance
of ucp-3 in the skeletal muscle mitochondria is described as
part of the metabolic regulatory events that take place in
skeletal muscle during lactation. the comparison of changes
in ucp-3 mrna and ucp-3 protein levels indicates that, as
a general rule, long-term modifications in ucp-3 mrna, such
as those observed in lactation or high-fat diet, lead to significant changes in ucp-3 protein abundance in mitochondria.
however, short-term modifications in ucp-3 mrna levels,
such as those elicited by 24-h fasting or 24-h weaning, had no
significant effect on ucp-3 protein abundance. indeed, previous reports on the effects of fasting showed a modest
increase in ucp-3 protein only after 2-day starvation (28). in
the absence of ucp-3 protein turnover studies, these results
indicate a slow-acting translational and/or posttranslational
regulation of the ucp-3 gene.
in the context of the current debate on the physiological
role of ucp-3, two physiological events occur in lactation that
are compatible with the downregulation of ucp-3 gene
expression: a reduction in nonshivering thermogenesis (21)
and a decrease in the utilization of  xxxd2154xxx  by muscle,
which favors the use of these substrates by the mammary
gland for milk production (24). the time-course of ucp-3 protein downregulation throughout lactation fits well with the
adaptative reduction in nonshivering thermogenesis, which
develops progressively as lactation proceeds (21–23). thus,
ucp-3 protein abundance is slightly decreased in dams just
after parturition, when milk production is very low, whereas
it attains minimal levels in mid-lactation when milk production is maximal. however, the drop in ucp-3 mrna after parturition is abrupt and ucp-3 mrna expression is extremely
low in lactating mice at any moment of lactation, indicating
that regulatory events leading to a low expression of the
ucp-3 gene start long before substantial energy-sparing
mechanisms are required. in this sense, circulating fatty
acids are already reduced just 1 day after parturition.
our results indicate that different stages of lactation or
nutritional manipulations in the breeding period (fasting,
weaning, and high-fat diet) were associated with changes in
ucp-3 mrna expression in skeletal muscle only when the levels of free  xxxd2154xxx  were modified in the same direction and
regardless of the lipolytic activity of adipose tissue. for
instance, both fasting and weaning activate ucp-3 mrna

expression in skeletal muscle of lactating dams because they
cause an increase in free fatty acid levels. however, lipolysis
is activated during fasting, but it is reduced in weaning, when
the rise in free  xxxd2154xxx  is caused by the sudden impairment
of their use by the mammary gland (34). this supports the
notion that  xxxd2154xxx  themselves regulate the expression of
the ucp-3 gene in skeletal muscle during lactation. other hormonal or metabolic signals previously reported to induce
the ucp-3 gene in muscle, such as leptin or thyroid hormones, are unlikely to play a major role in ucp-3 downregulation during lactation. the levels of circulating leptin are
unaltered during lactation (35), and, although lactation is
associated with a mild hypothyroid state, changes in serum
thyroid hormones due to fasting (36) or litter size manipulation (37) do not correlate with changes in ucp-3 mrna
expression in muscle.
activators of ppar reverse the ucp-3 mrna downregulation during lactation, and they are likely to mimic the positive
action of  xxxd2154xxx  on the ucp-3 gene. whereas the effects
of long-term treatments with fibrates or thiazolidinediones
may rely on indirect metabolic mechanisms (38,39), the effectiveness of ppar activators in the very short-term exposure
shown here suggests direct effects on skeletal muscle. the ability of fibrates to induce the ucp-3 gene in muscle has been
reported in newborn mice (12) and adult rats (39), and the
highest potency of wy-14,643, a specific ligand of ppar- in
lactating mice, supports a major involvement of this ppar subtype in ucp-3 gene regulation in skeletal muscle. according
to the present results, the higher sensitivity to ppar- activation of the ucp-3 gene expression in skeletal muscle of
lactating mice was not attributable to changes in ppar-
receptor expression. a potential explanation for these findings
would be that if ppar- activation mimics the effect of free
 xxxd2154xxx  on ucp-3 mrna in skeletal muscle (12), then this
pathway of stimulation would already be quite active in virgin
mice because virgin mice have higher levels of serum free fatty
acid levels and ucp-3 mrna expression. as a result, a lack of
sensitivity to ppar- activators is observed here. in most
cases, target genes of ppar- regulation code for enzymes and
proteins that are part of the lipid oxidation machinery of the
cell (40), and the identification of the ucp-3 gene as a target
of ppar- activation further supports its putative involvement in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. troglitazone, an
antidiabetic thiazolidinedione and a specific activator of
ppar- (33), could also induce ucp-3 gene expression in
skeletal muscle of lactating mice and normalize ucp-3 mrna
levels, but, in contrast to fibrates, it was also effective in virgin animals. this finding indicates a different pathway of regulation of ucp-3 gene expression by ppar- activation, with
respect to the ppar-–dependent pathway. moreover, it suggests that the ppar-–dependent activation of the ucp-3
gene is not related to the physiological action of  xxxd2154xxx  promoting ucp-3 gene expression. although ppar- is
extremely low in skeletal muscle (12,33), chronic treatments
of humans or rodents with troglitazone are known to improve
insulin sensitivity and reduce triacylglyceride content in
skeletal muscle (41). several recent reports claim there is a
direct effect of thiazolidinediones on this tissue (42,43), which
would be consistent with the effects on the ucp-3 gene
observed in this study. however, newborn mice, which are
highly sensitive to upregulation of ucp-3 gene expression in
response to ppar- activators, are poorly sensitive to the

action of thiazolidinediones (12). further research will be
necessary to establish the precise mechanisms of action of thiazolidinediones on the ucp-3 gene in muscle and how they are
modified in different physiological situations.
insulin resistance of skeletal muscle is fundamental to the
development of type 2 diabetes, and excessive exposure of
muscle to free  xxxd2154xxx  appears to play a prominent role in
the appearance of the insulin-resistant state associated with
obesity (44). understanding the regulatory mechanisms of
fatty acid oxidation by the skeletal muscle cells is essential for
the development of strategies to avoid an insulin-resistant
state. in the present work, we report that impaired ucp-3
gene expression in skeletal muscle is a physiological event
associated with the metabolic adaptations of lactation and, particularly, with the reduced utilization of  xxxd2154xxx  by the tissue as an energy source. both fibrates and troglitazone reverse
the downregulation of the ucp-3 mrna expression. further
research should be undertaken to determine the involvement
of the ucp-3 gene upregulation in skeletal muscle in the
hypolipidemic and antidiabetic effects of these drugs.
