background and purpose: a1-adrenoceptor antagonists are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension and lower
urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. among the side effects, ejaculatory dysfunction occurs
more frequently with drugs that are relatively selective for a1a-adrenoceptors compared with other drugs of this class. this
suggests that a1a-adrenoceptors may contribute to ejaculation. however, this has not been studied at the molecular level.
experimental approach: the physiological contribution of each a1-adrenoceptor subtype was characterized using
a1-adrenoceptor subtype-selective knockout (ko) mice (a1a-, a1b- and a1d-ar ko mice) since the subtype-specific drugs
available are only moderately selective. we analysed the role of a1-adrenoceptors in the blood pressure and vascular response
as well as ejaculation by determining these variables in a1-adrenoceptor subtype-selective ko mice and in mice with all their
a1-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted (a1-ar triple-ko mice).
key results: the pregnancy rate was reduced by 50% in a1a-adrenoceptor ko mice, and this reduction was dramatically
enhanced in a1-adrenoceptor triple-ko mice. contractile tension of the vas deferens in response to noradrenaline was
markedly decreased in a1a-adrenoceptor ko mice, and this contraction was completely abolished in a1-adrenoceptor triple-ko
mice. this attenuation of contractility was also observed in the electrically stimulated vas deferens.
conclusions and implications: these results demonstrate that a1-adrenoceptors, particularly a1a-adrenoceptors, are required
for normal contractility of the vas deferens and consequent sperm ejaculation as well as having a function in fertility.

introduction
a1-adrenoceptors are stimulated by catecholamines released
from sympathetic nerves and are known to have an
important role in regulating the various physiological
functions of the peripheral tissues. a1-adrenoceptors have
been classified into three subtypes, a1a, a1b and a1d, by
molecular cloning and pharmacological analysis (mcgrath,
1982; han et al., 1987a; foglar et al., 1995; guarino et al.,
1996). the contribution of each a1-adrenoceptor subtype to
catecholamine-induced physiological responses was characterized in our previous studies using mice with targeted

disruption of each subtype gene (a1a-, a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptor knockout (ko) mice), as the subtype-specific drugs
available are only moderately selective and may interact
with other adrenoceptors and non-adrenoceptors (cavalli
et al., 1997; spreng et al., 2001; drouin et al., 2002; rokosh
and simpson, 2002; tanoue et al., 2002a; o’connell et al.,
2003, 2006). previous studies have clearly indicated that
a1-adrenoceptors play an important role in the regulation of
blood pressure (bp) (cavalli et al., 1997; rokosh and
simpson, 2002; tanoue et al., 2002a), focal vascular drug
responsiveness (hosoda et al., 2005b), cardiac growth
(o’connell et al., 2003, 2006) and glucose homeostasis
(burcelin et al., 2004).
since catecholamines cause vascular smooth muscle contraction by activating a1-adrenoceptors, a1-adrenoceptor
antagonists were originally introduced for the treatment of

hypertension. however, after the publication of several
clinical trials, such as the allhat (antihypertensive and
lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack; allhat
collaborative research group, 2000) and v-heft (cohn,
1988), these antagonists are no longer considered suitable for
the primary treatment of this condition (chobanian et al.,
2003). instead, a1-adrenoceptor antagonists are extensively
used in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms
associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) (van dijk
et al., 2006). while these antagonists are relatively safe drugs,
some clinical studies have shown that ejaculatory dysfunction occurs during treatment with them (debruyne, 2000;
van dijk et al., 2006). since this side effect occurs more
frequently with tamuslosin and  xxxd3202xxx , which are relatively selective for the a1a-subtype compared to other drugs
of this class, a1a-adrenoceptors may contribute to ejaculatory
function (kawabe et al., 2006; van dijk et al., 2006). a recent
clinical study showed that acute treatment with tamuslosin
reduces the mean ejaculatory volume by approximately 45%,
and no sperm were detected in the midstream urine obtained
after ejaculation (hisasue et al., 2006; hellstrom and sikka,
2006). these studies indicate that a1-adrenoceptor antagonistassociated abnormal ejaculation may represent anejaculation rather than retrograde ejaculation. however, this has
not been studied at the molecular level. hence, in the
present study, we analysed the role of a1-adrenoceptors in bp
and vascular responses, as well as ejaculation, by use of mice
with targeted disruption of each a1-adrenoceptor subtype
as well as those with all a1-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted
(a1-ar triple-ko mice). our results demonstrated that
a1-adrenoceptors, particularly a1a-adrenoceptors, are required
for normal contractility in the vas deferens and consequent
sperm ejaculation and hence have a function in fertility.

methods
gene-targeted mice
each subtype-selective a1-adrenoceptor ko mouse (a1a-ar
ko, a1b-ar ko and a1d-ar ko mice) was generated, backcrossed with a c57bl/6j mouse more than six times, and
maintained on a c57bl/6j background (cavalli et al., 1997;
rokosh and simpson, 2002; tanoue et al., 2002b). in order
to generate mice with all a1-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted
(a1-ar triple-ko), each subtype-selective a1-adrenoceptor ko
mouse was crossbred. since male a1-adrenoceptor triple-ko
mice had a seriously defective breeding ability, the male mice
that were heterozygous for the a1a-adrenoceptor gene and
homozygous for both the a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptor genes
(a1a þ= a1b = a1d = -ar ko mice; a1a þ= bd ar ko mice)
were mated with female a1-adrenoceptor triple-ko mice. all
mice were housed in micro-isolator cages in a pathogen-free
barrier facility and placed on a 12 h light/dark cycle with
access to food and water ad libitum, except when an
experimental protocol was being followed. all data presented here were obtained from male mice. all experimental
procedures followed the approved guidelines of this institute.
genotyping was performed by pcr using genomic dna
from tail tissue, as described previously (tanoue et al.,

333

2002a). the expression level of the a1-adrenoceptors was
examined by rt-pcr using a total rna sample extracted
from the aorta and sexual organs, such as the vas deferens,
epidydimus, testis and seminal vesicle, as described previously (tanoue et al., 2002b). the body weight, tissue
weight and histological analysis were determined at 8–15
weeks of age, as described previously (tanoue et al., 2002b).

receptor binding study
a receptor binding study was performed as described
previously (hosoda et al., 2005a). in brief, whole brain was
dissected from mice, placed in lysis buffer a (250 mm sucrose,
5 mm tris-hcl and 1 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4) and homogenized
with a polytron homogenizer (kinematica, basel, switzerland)
at 41c and at speed 7 for 10 s. the homogenate was then
centrifuged at 1000 g at 41c for 10 min to remove the nuclei.
the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 35 000 g for
20 min at 41c. the resulting pellet was resuspended in
binding buffer b (50 mm tris-hcl, 10 mm mgcl2 and 10 mm
egta, ph 7.4) and frozen at 801c until the assay. the
protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic
acid protein assay kit (pierce chemical, rockford, il, usa).
radioligand binding studies were performed using [125i](2-b-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl)-tetralone ([125i]heat; 2200 ci mmol1; perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences, boston, ma, usa). in brief, 20–100 mg of membrane
protein from brain was incubated with [125i]-heat in a final
volume of 250 ml of binding buffer b, in the presence or
absence of competing drugs, for 60 min at 251c. the
incubation was terminated by addition of ice-cold buffer b
and immediate filtration through whatman gf/c glass fibre
filters with a brandel cell harvester (model-30; brandel inc.,
gaithersburg, md, usa). each filter was collected, and the
radioactivity was measured. binding assays were always
performed in duplicate. nonspecific binding was defined as
binding displaced by 10 mm  xxxd2914xxx .

determination of sperm content in male sexual organs
and sperm motility
mice were anaesthetized with 50 mg kg1 sodium pentobarbitone and killed by decapitation. the testis, epidydimus and
vas deferens were isolated and weighed. the sperm content
of these tissues was measured following the procedure of
joyce et al. (1993). briefly, tissues were homogenized with
the polytron homogenizer on ice in pbs containing 0.05%
triton x-100 (sigma, st louis, mo, usa). the homogenate
was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with
4% trypan blue. the number of sperm nuclei was counted
using a haemacytometer and the total number of sperm in
each tissue was obtained. daily sperm production (dsp) was
estimated by dividing the number of sperm per gram of
tissue by 4.84, as described previously (joyce et al., 1993).
to assess sperm motility, fluid from the caudal epidydimus
was diluted in medium 199 containing 0.5% (wv1) bsa. the
diluted sample solution was incubated in the sample
chamber (microslides #htr1099, vitrocom inc., mountain
lakes, nj, usa), and sperm motility parameters, such as the
percentage of motile sperm, percentage of progressive sperm,

smoothed path velocity, straight line velocity, track velocity
and amplitude of lateral head displacement, were determined using tox ivos (hamilton thorne research, beverly,
ma, usa).

number of ejaculated sperm and sexual behaviour
to determine the number of ejaculated sperm from male
mice, the number of sperm in the female uterus was counted
after overnight mating. to synchronize the female sexual
cycle, 5 u of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin was
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into sexually immature
females (3–4 weeks old). forty-eight hours after the injection, the mice were injected with 5 u of human chorionic
gonadotropin and mated with a1-ar triple-ko male mice for
16 h. the formation of a vaginal plug and the number of
ejaculated sperm in the uterus were then determined as
described above. typical sexual behaviour, such as sniffing,
chasing and mounting, were monitored after mating for 2 h,
as described previously (ratnasooriya and wadsworth, 1990;
ban et al., 2002). the total number exhibiting typical sexual
behaviour, as an index of libido (number mated per number
paired  100), was estimated.

mechanical responses
the thoracic aorta and mesenteric artery were isolated from
anaesthetized animals and dissected free of excess fat and
connective tissue. each artery was helically cut into a section
15–20 mm in length and 1 mm in width. the intimal surface
of each artery was gently rubbed with a moistened filter
paper to remove the endothelium, the functional absence of
which was confirmed by the lack of a relaxant response to
acetylcholine (10 mm). aortic or mesenteric artery preparations were suspended in a 20-ml organ bath filled with a
normal tyrode’s solution (in mm: nacl 158.3, kcl 4.0, cacl2
2.0, mgcl2 1.05, nah2po4 0.42, nahco3 10.0 and glucose
5.6), kept at 36.570.51c and bubbled with a mixture of 95%
o2 and 5% co2. to prevent the oxidation of noradrenaline
(na), l- xxxd228xxx  (10 mm) was added to the solution. the
tension was monitored continuously and recorded isometrically by a force displacement transducer. experiments were
conducted in the presence of propranolol (1 mm), yohimbine
(0.3 mm), desipramine (0.3 mm) and deoxycorticosterone
acetate (10 mm), to block b1-/b2- and a2-adrenoceptors and
to inhibit the neural and non-neural uptake of na,
respectively. to determine the responsiveness of the vas
deferens to drugs, it was isolated, dissected and incubated
as described above. an analysis of contractile function of
the vas deferens was performed by applying electrical
stimulation at frequencies of 2–32 hz.

measurement of bp and heart rate
the systolic bp (sbp) and heart rate (hr) were measured in
conscious mice with a computerized tail-cuff system (ba-98a
system; softron co., tokyo, japan) that determines sbp using
a photoelectric sensor (tanoue et al., 2002b). mice were
anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (40 mg kg1 i.p.)
and a stretched intramedic pe-10 polyethylene catheter
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 152 332–340

(clay adams, parsippany, nj, usa) was inserted into the
right carotid artery. the catheter was connected to a pressure
transducer (spr-671, millar instruments, houston, tx,
usa), and the map was recorded on a powerlab system
(bio research center, nagoya, japan). propranolol (3 mg kg1)
was injected before the experiments to avoid any effects due
to stimulation of b-adrenoceptors. to examine the pressor
responses, drugs in a volume of 30 ml were administered
through a catheter inserted into the right femoral or jugular
vein as a bolus at 15–20 min intervals after ensuring that the
map and hr had returned to their baseline levels.

statistics
data are expressed as the means7s.e. statistical analysis was
performed using analysis of variance followed by a post hoc
comparison with fisher’s plsd using statview version 5.0
software (concepts, inc., berkeley, ca, usa). differences
between groups were considered statistically significant
when po0.05.

drugs
the following drugs were used: na bitartrate (wako-junyaku,
osaka, japan);  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride,  xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride, ()-phenylephrine hydrochloride, propranolol
hydrochloride, yohimbine hydrochloride, desipramine
hydrochloride, ab-methylene atp lithium salt and deoxycorticosterone acetate (sigma, st louis, mo, usa).

results
receptor binding and general characteristics
to confirm the disruption of all a1-adrenoceptor genes, a
binding assay was performed using the cerebral cortex
membrane from a1-ar triple-ko mice (figures 1a and b).
a saturation binding and scatchard plot clearly indicated
that the a1-adrenoceptor was completely absent in a1-ar
triple-ko mice (figures 1a and b). the maximum binding
density of the cerebral cortex membrane from the wild-type
(wt) mice was 102726 fmol mg1protein, while that from
the a1-ar triple-ko mice was undetectable. a1-ar triple-ko
mice survived, developed normally and grew for at least 1
year. similar tissue weights were observed with a1-ar
triple-ko and wt mice (table 1).

vascular response and bp
next, we examined the contractile function of arteries, such
as the aorta and mesenteric arteries, in response to na
(figures 1c and d). neither the aorta nor the mesenteric
arteries from a1-ar triple-ko mice contracted in response to
na, while both the aorta and the mesenteric arteries from
wt mice contracted in a concentration-dependent manner
(figures 1c and d). as in the in vitro experiments, the in vivo
pressor response to phenylephrine, an a1-agonist, was
dramatically lost in a1-ar triple-ko mice (figures 2a and
b). a1-ar triple-ko mice showed lower bp than wt mice
(figure 2b), and a reduced level of conscious bp was observed

in both a1-ar triple-ko mice and the a1a þ= a1b = a1d = adrenoceptor ko mice (a1a þ= bd ar ko mouse) (figure 2c).
there were no differences in the hrs between the mice
(figure 2d).

male sexual function
although the a1-ar triple-ko mice developed normally,
severe defects in the breeding activity were seen in a1a-ar
ko mice. in order to confirm the presence of a defect in the
breeding activity and analyse which a1-adrenoceptor contributes to this defect, we determined the pregnancy rate in
each type of mouse. the pregnancy rate was reduced by 50%
in a1a-ar ko mice (figure 3a), and this reduction was
dramatically enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko mice (figure 3a).
since the pregnancy rate was similar when pairing wt male
mice with wt females, and male a1a þ= bd ar ko mice with
female a1-ar triple-ko mice (figure 3a), the reduction in the
pregnancy rate was caused by male infertility.

in order to address the underlying mechanisms of male
infertility in a1a-ar ko and a1-ar triple-ko mice, we
performed in vitro fertilization using sperm and eggs isolated
from male a1-ar triple-ko and female mice. the in vitro
fertilization was successful, and no obvious abnormalities
were noted when comparing these mice with wt mice
(figure 3b), suggesting that the fertility of sperm from a1-ar
triple-ko mice was normal. the sperm number in testis as
well as dsp was identical in a1-ar triple-ko and wt mice
(figure 4). we then examined the motility of sperm from
a1-ar triple-ko mice. all parameters of sperm motility, such
as motile sperm, progressive sperm, smoothed path velocity
and straight line velocity, were similar in sperm from a1-ar
triple-ko, a1a þ= bd r ko, a1a-ar ko and wt mice (table 2).
lack of sexual drive (libido) is another potential mechanism
for a lower pregnancy rate, since the a1-adrenoceptors are
associated with behavioural sensitization (salomon et al.,
2006). we counted typical sexual behaviour, such as sniffing,
chasing and mounting, during mating for 2 h (ratnasooriya
and wadsworth, 1990; ban et al., 2002). there was no

100% in a1-ar triple-ko mice and 100% in wt mice, n ¼ 7
pairs in each group).

sperm ejaculation and vas deferens
since some a1-adrenoceptor antagonists are known to alter
the male ejaculatory function (debruyne, 2000; van dijk
et al., 2006) and this occurs more frequently with relatively
selective a1a-adrenoceptor antagonists than with other drugs
of this class, we analysed the ejaculatory function in a1aadrenoceptor ko and a1-ar triple-ko mice. female mice
were mated with male a1-ar triple-ko, a1a þ= bd ar ko, a1aar ko or wt mice. the success rate of the mating, estimated
by the presence of a vaginal plug the next morning, was
decreased for male a1a-ar ko mice and further reduced for
male a1-ar triple-ko mice (figure 3c). consistent with the
mating success rate, the number of sperm in the female
uterus was lower in a1a-ar ko mice and almost absent in a1ar triple-ko mice, particularly when compared with that in
wt mice (figures 3d and e). a greater reduction in the sperm
number was observed in the vas deferens of a1-ar triple-ko
than in that of wt mice (figure 4). this result suggests that
the impaired transportation of sperm from the testis to the
vas deferens is a potential mechanism of ejaculation
dysfunction in a1-ar triple-ko mice. to analyse the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of ejaculatory dysfunction
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 152 332–340

induced by disruption of the a1-adrenoceptor, we characterized the contractile function of vasa deferentia isolated from
a1-ar triple-ko mice (figure 5). contractile tension of the
vas deferens in response to na was markedly decreased in
a1a-ar ko mice, and this contraction was completely
abolished in a1-ar triple-ko mice (figure 5a), while
contractile tension in response to a-b-methylene atp
(a-b-matp) was enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko mice
(figure 5b). an attenuation of contractility was also observed
in the electrically stimulated vas deferens (figure 5c). this
result is consistent with a decrease in the mating success rate
of these animals as well as the reduced number of ejaculated
sperm (figures 3d and e). the expression profile of
a1-adrenoceptors in male sexual organs showed that the
a1a-adrenoceptor is dominant in both the epididymus and
the vas deferens and that disruption of the a1a-adrenoceptor
induces the upregulation of a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptors in
these tissues (figure 5d).

discussion
in the present study, we generated a1-ar triple-ko mice, in
which the specific binding activity of the a1-adrenoceptor
agonist was completely lost. the a1-ar triple-ko mice could
survive, develop normally and grow for at least 1 year. the
tissue weight and histological characteristics in the heart,
kidney, aorta, testis, vas deferens and sperm (data not
shown) were similar in the a1-ar triple-ko and wt mice.
these results imply that a1-adrenoceptors and the subse-

quent signalling via a1-adrenoceptors are not necessary for
survival.
in our previous study, we compared the in vitro contractile
response of the aorta and mesenteric arteries as well as the
in vivo pressor response of the map in a1b-ar ko, a1d-ar ko,

and a1bd-ar double-ko mice (hosoda et al., 2005a, b). a
greater reduction in the contractile force was observed in
both the aorta and mesenteric arteries from a1bd-ar doubleko mice than in those from each of the subtype-specific
a1-ar ko mice. however, a residual contraction, approximately
15–25% of the total tension in response to na, was present
in the tissues from the a1bd-ar double-ko mice (hosoda
et al., 2005a, b). similar to the in vitro results, the pressor
response of map to a-adrenoceptor agonists was still evident
in a1bd-ar double-ko mice (hosoda et al., 2005a, b). in the
present study, neither the aorta nor the mesenteric arteries
from a1-ar triple-ko mice developed tension in response to
na, while both the aorta and the mesenteric arteries from
wt mice contracted in a concentration-dependent manner.
as in in vitro experiments, the in vivo pressor response to
phenylephrine, an a1-adrenoceptor agonist, was dramatically
lost in a1-ar triple-ko mice. our findings indicate that the
disruption of all three a1-adrenoceptor subtypes can result in
complete loss of the contractile function of vascular smooth
muscle in response to catecholamine and the subsequent
pressor response. these findings allow us to conclude that
each of the a1-adrenoceptor subtypes, such as a1a/c-, a1b- and
a1d-ar, is able to generate a physiological pressor response
via a1-adrenoceptor signalling in the vascular system.

figure 5 contractile dysfunction in the vas deferens from the a1-adrenoceptor triple ko mouse (a1-ar triple-ko). (a and b) contractile
tension in response to na or a-b-matp in the vas deferens from a1-ar triple-ko mice. contractions in response to na were not observed in the
vas deferens from a1-ar triple-ko mice and were partially attenuated in a1a-ar ko mice, while contractions in response to a-b-matp were
enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko mice. (d) expression levels of various receptor genes in sexual glands from a1-ar triple-ko mice. *po0.05,

ko, knockout; na, noradrenaline; wt, wild type.

as described in a previous study, no obvious reduction in
systolic bp was observed in a1a-ar ko mice, while a
significant decrease in bp was detected in a1b- and a1d-ar
ko mice (cavalli et al., 1997; tanoue et al., 2002b; o’connell
et al., 2003). similar to a1a-ar ko mice, a1-ar triple-ko mice
showed no additional reduction of conscious bp, in contrast
to the a1a þ= bd ar ko mouse. these results imply that the
contribution of a1a-adrenoceptors to the maintenance of bp
at the basal level is relatively small. in contrast to the bp, the
pregnancy rate was reduced in a1a-ar ko mice, and this
reduction was significantly enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko
mice; this reduction in the pregnancy rate resulted from
male infertility. these findings indicate that a1-adrenoceptor,
particularly the a1a-subtype, plays an essential role in male
fertility. to address the underlying mechanisms of male
infertility in a1a-ar ko and a1-ar triple-ko mice, we
performed in vitro fertilization and sperm motility analyses.
all the results suggested that the fertilization ability of sperm
and sperm motility are normal in male a1-ar triple-ko mice.
the sperm number in testis as well as the dsp was identical
in a1-ar triple-ko and wt mice. there was no difference in
the total number of typical sexual behaviours between a1-ar
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 152 332–340

triple-ko and wt mice during mating. since no alterations
in the histology of the testis and sperm of a1-ar triple-ko
mice were detected when compared with those of wt mice
(data not shown), the data from all the experiments strongly
suggest that male infertility in a1a-ar ko and a1-ar tripleko mice results from other mechanisms.
we observed an ejaculation dysfunction of the sperm
concomitant with a lower rate of mating success in male a1a-ar
ko mice, and this defect was enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko
mice. all the findings indicate that the a1-adrenoceptor
is required for normal sperm ejaculation and that the
a1a-subtype plays a dominant role in sperm ejaculation. a
recent clinical study indicates that a1-adrenoceptor antagonistassociated abnormal ejaculation may represent anejaculation rather than retrograde ejaculation (hisasue et al., 2006;
hellstrom and sikka, 2006). although tamuslosin can
facilitate rhythmic spike contractions that are not mediated
by a1-adrenoceptors, in addition to having an antagonist
action on a1-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions (tambaro
et al., 2005), all the results suggest that a1-adrenoceptors,
particularly a1a-adrenoceptors, play an important role in
ejaculatory function. consistent with these clinical data, our

a1-adrenoceptors in normal male sexual function
a sanbe et al

present study showed that the contractile tension of the vas
deferens induced by electrical stimulation as well as in
response to na was markedly decreased in a1a-ar ko mice
and that this contraction was completely abolished in a1-ar
triple-ko mice, while contractile tension in response to
a-b-matp was enhanced in a1-ar triple-ko mice. these
results indicate that a1-adrenoceptors are required for normal
contraction of the vas deferens and consequent sperm
ejaculation. our data also indicate that the a1a-subtype has
an important role in all sexual functions and that the
up-regulation of a1b- and a1d-subtypes can partially compensate for the dysfunction induced by blockade of the
a1a-subtype. since it is known that purinergic stimulation via
the  xxxg1643xxx  receptor is necessary for normal ejaculation
(mulryan et al., 2000), it is probable that activation of
purinergic nerves to stimulate the  xxxg1643xxx  receptor in association with sympathetic nerves to stimulate the a1-adrenoceptor
is necessary for normal ejaculation.
in many previous studies the contractility in the vas
deferens was analysed in rats using conventional antagonists, such as chlorethylclonidine, a relatively selective
a1b-adrenoceptor antagonist, and rs 100329, an a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist (han et al., 1987a, b; cleary et al., 2004). it has
been shown that a different subtype of adrenoceptor, as well
as other receptors, is involved in the contraction between
the proximal and distal segments of the vas deferens and
that this regulation by different receptors is also observed
between tonic and phasic contractions (westfall and westfall,
2001; cleary et al., 2003; cuprian et al., 2005). moreover,
while the a1a-adrenoceptor can contribute to the contraction
in the vas deferens via the sympathetic nerve in all species,
including rats and mice, there may be considerable species
differences with regard to the involvement of an additional
subtype of adrenoceptor (westfall and westfall, 2001). it is
known that contractile responses to endogenous nerve
stimulation and exogenous agonists may be also mediated
via a different subtype of receptor (mallard et al., 1992; guh
et al., 1995). we analysed the contractility in one segment of
the vas deferens (containing the proximal and distal
segments) of mice, and it was difficult to separate the phasic
and tonic contractions under our present experimental
conditions. thus, our results may be due to activation of
the various subtypes of adrenoceptor as well as other
receptors (westfall and westfall, 2001; cleary et al., 2003;
cuprian et al., 2005). while some technical difficulties need
to be overcome for a detailed analysis of the responses of the
mouse vas deferens, additional studies are needed to
elucidate the functional regulation of the vas deferens by
a1-adrenoceptors.
although abnormal ejaculation is frequently seen with
tamuslosin and  xxxd3202xxx , which are relatively selective for
the a1a-adrenoceptor compared to other drugs of this class,
in clinical studies no obvious effect on ejaculation was
detected with relatively non-selective a1-adrenoceptor
antagonists, such as alfuzosin, doxazosin,  xxxd3000xxx  and
terazosin, (van dijk et al., 2006). it is known that tamuslosin
is not a fully surmountable (a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist in
the human vas deferens (furukawa et al., 1995; noble et al.,
1997). furthermore, previous studies showed that tamuslosin may have an effect on subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine

339

and dopamine receptors (wyllie, 1999; van dijk et al., 2006).
hence, the effects on ejaculation may be caused by
alterations in the central nervous system rather than
peripheral tissues (van dijk et al., 2006). thus, the abnormal
ejaculation induced by tamuslosin as well as other
a1a-adrenoceptor antagonists may be caused by effects
other than a1-adrenoceptor blockade (tambaro et al., 2005).
hence, further studies are needed to analyse the cause of
the abnormal ejaculation induced by a1a-adrenoceptor
antagonists.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that a1-adrenoceptors, particularly a1a-adrenoceptors, are required for normal
contraction of the vas deferens and consequent sperm
ejaculation. the contractile dysfunction of the vas deferens
induced by the loss of functioning a1a-adrenoceptors can
explain the side effect observed in patients being treated
with an a1a-adrenoceptor blocker. this information is
important for the treatment of urinary symptoms induced
by bph as well as prostatitis, as most patients with these
conditions are young adults.
