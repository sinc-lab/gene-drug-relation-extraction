venous thromboembolism in heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
theodore e. warkentin, md

deep-vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism are
among the most common complications of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (hit), an antibody-mediated adverse effect
of heparin that leads paradoxically to in vivo activation of
platelets and the coagulation system. inappropriate treatment
of hit-associated dvt with warfarin can cause the dvt to
progress to limb gangrene: this results from impaired ability of
the protein c natural anticoagulant pathway to down-regulate
thrombin generation, thus leading to microvascular thrombosis
and tissue necrosis. appreciation of the importance of coagulation system activation in hit provides a rationale for treatments that reduce thrombin generation, either via inhibiting
 xxxg741xxx  (danaparoid) or via inhibiting thrombin directly
( xxxd2455xxx ). clinicians should know how to distinguish hit from
other thrombocytopenic disorders: for example, thrombocytopenia associated with pulmonary embolism can mimic hit
(pseudo-hit), and acute dyspnea that can mimic acute
pulmonary embolism can result from acute in vivo platelet activation in a patient with hit antibodies who receives heparin
bolus therapy (pseudo-pulmonary embolism). curr opin pulm med

heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) is an important drug reaction of relevance to physicians who treat
venous thromboembolism. this is because deep-vein
thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism (pe) are
the most common complications of hit. further, inappropriate management can lead to worsening of thrombosis, as in the recently recognized syndrome of
coumarin-induced venous limb gangrene. further, pe
itself—even in the absence of hit—can be complicated by thrombocytopenia, thus posing a diagnostic and
treatment dilemma.

pathogenesis of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia: an overview
there are three unusual aspects to the pathogenesis of
hit [1,2]: (1) the compound nature of the target
antigen ( xxxg1726xxx /heparin complexes); (2) antibody-mediated platelet activation; and (3) the resulting
activation of the coagulation system (in vivo thrombin
generation).

amiral et al. [3] reported that the target antigen of hit
is a complex between an endogenous alpha-granule protein,
 xxxg1726xxx  ( xxxg1726xxx ), and heparin. stoichiometric
concentrations of  xxxg1726xxx  and heparin form multimolecular
complexes [4] that bind to platelet surfaces via the
heparin moiety [5]. at least two sites on  xxxg1726xxx  are recognized by hit antibodies [6]. twelve or more saccharide
units are required for heparin to bind to  xxxg1726xxx , and to
render  xxxg1726xxx  immunogenic [7,8].
a unique feature of hit is that the  xxxg1726xxx /heparin-antibody-platelet interaction results in platelet activation
[9,10]. this occurs via occupancy of the fcgammaiia receptors
on platelets by the fc moieties of the antibodies [10],
leading to fc receptor clustering and phosphorylation of
various platelet proteins [11]. igg-mediated platelet
activation leads to a procoagulant platelet response,
including the formation of procoagulant, plateletderived microparticles [12,13•].

this antibody-induced procoagulant platelet response
can explain the profound activation of coagulation in
hit. considerable thrombin generation occurs in vivo,
as shown by marked elevation in thrombin-antithrombin
complex levels: median thrombin-antithrombin levels in
patients with hit are 43 µg/l, compared with levels in
control patients with postoperative dvt (median, 7.6
µg/l) or normal patients (< 4 µg/l) [14,15]. other

factors that could contribute to thrombin generation
include activation of endothelial cells by antibodies
reactive against  xxxg1726xxx  complexed to endothelial surface
heparan sulfate [16]. neutralization of heparin’s anticoagulant effects by  xxxg1726xxx  released from activated platelets
is another procoagulant effect of hit.
marked in vivo thrombin generation helps explain
several clinical features of hit, including its association
with venous and arterial thrombosis (hypercoagulable
state) [17], the occurrence of decompensated (hypofibrinogenemic) disseminated intravascular coagulation in
5 to 10% of hit patients [17], and the risk for progression of dvt to venous limb gangrene in some hit
patients who are treated with warfarin [14,18•]. this last
syndrome results from a disturbance in procoagulantanticoagulant balance during coumarin therapy: warfarin
treatment results in severe acquired reduction in protein
c, while at the same time it fails to control thrombin
generation (discussed subsequently).

frequency of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
the frequency of hit is variable and depends in part on
the type of heparin used. unfractionated heparin is more
likely to cause hit antibody formation, as well as clinical
hit, than is  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh)
[19,20]. recently, the impact of the type of patient population also has been recognized [21,22]. for example,
cardiac surgical patients are more likely than orthopedic
surgical patients to develop hit antibodies during treatment with unfractionated heparin; surprisingly, however,
among patients who form hit antibodies, orthopedic
patients are more likely to develop hit itself [22].
duration of heparin treatment is another factor that
influences the frequency of hit: both prospective and
retrospective studies indicate a characteristic timing of
onset of thrombocytopenia that begins 5 to 10 days after
starting heparin [19,21]. however, the platelet count fall
can begin abruptly in patients who have recently
received heparin (within the past 100 days). recent
evidence indicates that this is caused by residual circulating antibodies that were produced following the
recent heparin exposure, rather than resulting from a
secondary (anamnestic) immune response to the subsequently administered heparin [23].

venous thromboembolism complicating
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
historically, hit was regarded as a disorder that
primarily caused thrombosis of large arteries [24].
however, over the past 5 years, its strong association
with venous thromboembolism has been recognized.
indeed, venous thrombosis predominates in a ratio as
high as about 4:1 [25,26,27••].

prospective studies

lee and i recently reviewed the frequency of hit-associated thrombosis among different patient populations
[22]. among medical patients who developed hit, arterial and venous thrombotic events were similar in
frequency. however, among surgical patients, there was
a strong predominance of venous thromboembolism (14
patients with venous thrombotic events, compared with
1 patient with an arterial event, among the three postoperative orthopedic studies reviewed).
figure 1, which summarizes the clinical course of nine
patients who developed hit in a clinical trial, illustrates
the predominance of venous thromboembolism in this
patient population [19]; seven of these patients developed 12 venous thrombotic events, including three
patients with bilateral lower-limb dvt and two patients
who developed pe.
heparin-induced thromboembolism was a strong independent risk factor for thrombosis in this study [19].
since the patients underwent surveillance venography,
quantitation of the thrombotic risk of hit (by odds
ratio) compared with control patients could be assessed
(table 1). the data indicate that the more serious the
thromboembolic event, the stronger its association
with hit.

influence of the type of heparin

this study [19] also showed that there is a lower
frequency of hit antibody formation, as well as clinical
hit itself, among patients treated with lmwh,
compared with unfractionated heparin. there is a plausible biologic explanation for this difference in risk:
heparins with saccharide length of 12 or greater are
better able to produce the target antigen with  xxxg1726xxx  [7,8].
recently, funk et al. [20] confirmed a marked reduction
in risk for hit among patients treated with lmwh.
retrospective studies

several large retrospective studies have examined the
spectrum of thrombosis complicating hit [25,26,
27••,28]. in most studies, venous thrombosis predominates, with the highest ratio of venous/arterial thrombosis reported as 4.3 [25] from a center that used heparin
commonly for postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis.
the lowest ratio, 0.6 (ie, predominance of arterial thrombosis) was observed by a vascular surgery service [28];
this could be explained by referral bias or by an
increased risk for arterial thrombosis among patients
with pre-existing arteriopathy. in our center, dvt
occurred in about 50% of patients clinically recognized
to have hit; overall, about 25% of patients with hit
had symptomatic pulmonary embolism [25].

definition of thrombocytopenia in
postoperative patients
figure 1 shows that postoperative thrombocytosis occurs
commonly following major surgery. this suggests that a
major fall in platelet count attributable to hit might not
necessarily result in a platelet count fall to less than 150 x
109/l. indeed, an analysis of platelet counts suggests that
a 50% fall from the postoperative peak is strongly associ-

ated with hit. in postoperative patients, this is a far
more sensitive definition for thrombocytopenia indicative of hit, without substantial loss of specificity [29].

thrombocytopenia and pulmonary embolism
monreal et al. [30] have reported that thrombocytopenia is
a feature of pe, but not dvt. indeed, sometimes severe
thrombocytopenia complicating pe occurs, with coagulation tests strongly suggestive of disseminated intravascular
coagulation [31–33]. this can pose a clinical dilemma, as a
patient who develops pe and thrombocytopenia during, or
soon after, heparin treatment cannot be reliably diagnosed
as having hit or not on clinical grounds alone.
figure 2 illustrates two similar platelet count profiles
from two patients with pe: one patient had serologically
proven hit, the other patient tested negative for hit
antibodies [31]. whereas heparin is contraindicated in
patients with hit, it is the anticoagulant of choice in
patients with pe-associated thrombocytopenia and will
result in platelet count recovery. from a practical
management viewpoint, however, patients recently
treated with heparin who develop thrombocytopenia in
association with pe should probably be assumed to have
hit until proven otherwise. thus, these patients will
require an alternative anticoagulant until results for hit
antibodies are available (discussed subsequently). pe is
one of a small number of clinical syndromes that can
strongly resemble hit; this topic of pseudo-hit has
been recently discussed in detail [31].

(a) a patient developed a 59% platelet count fall from 387 to 159 x 109/l that
began on day 7 of unfractionated heparin prophylaxis following orthopedic
surgery. pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by pulmonary angiography on
postoperative day 11. the platelet count fell during initial intravenous heparin
therapy, rising only when sufficient unfractionated heparin was given (2360 u/h)
to overcome “heparin resistance” (as shown by subtherapeutic aptt values. hit
antibodies were not detectable (day 12), either by sra or  xxxg1726xxx /heparin-elisa.
(b) a similar platelet count profile as seen in part a also occurred in a patient
who developed a 57% platelet count fall from 378 to 161 x 109/l that began on
day 7 after cardiac surgery in which unfractionated heparin was given for cpb.
the platelet count recovered on therapeutic-dose danaparoid. only one clinical
clue pointed to the diagnosis of hit: erythematous skin lesions at the injection
sites observed on day 7 (not shown on the figure). testing for hit antibodies
was strongly positive by sra. the similar platelet count profiles of these patients
illustrate the difficulty in determining on clinical grounds whether postoperative
pe is caused by hit or not. aptt, activated partial thromboplastin time, cpb,

falls in their platelet count that sometimes are associated with unusual clinical symptoms and signs
[17,34–36]. these reactions have been termed “acute
systemic reactions.” although inflammatory reactions
(eg, fever, chills, flushing) are most common, some
patients develop predominant pulmonary (eg, dyspnea,
tachypnea, chest pain) or cardiac (eg, hypertension,
tachycardia, chest pain, cardiac arrest) symptoms and
signs. indeed, the clinical profile can so strongly
resemble acute pe that popov et al. [34] used the term

“pseudopulmonary embolism” to describe this
syndrome.
continuing heparin treatment in patients with pseudope can result in catastrophic outcomes [35]. figure 3
illustrates the fatal clinical course of a patient with acute
dyspnea following intravenous heparin bolus treatment
that was not recognized as being a manifestation of hit
[35]. physicians should consider acute hit in any
patient who develops unusual clinical symptoms and
signs within 30 minutes of receiving an intravenous
heparin bolus; an immediate platelet count should be
ordered and a comparison made with the most recent
preceding platelet count.

management of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
some of the most important recent advances in the
understanding of hit concern its management. indeed,
several treatment paradoxes have been recognized: (1)
failure of heparin cessation to prevent thrombosis
[25•,27••,31–36,37••,38•,39••]; (2) risk for progression
of dvt to venous limb gangrene in patients treated
with warfarin [14,18•]; and (3) risk for progressive or
recurrent thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in patients
treated with lmwh [40,41].
failure of heparin cessation to prevent thrombosis

in 1996, kelton and i reported [25] that cessation of
heparin, or substitution of heparin with warfarin, was
frequently unsuccessful in patients with isolated hit.
we defined isolated hit as serologically confirmed
hit that had been initially suspected on the basis of
thrombocytopenia alone, rather than because of a new
hit-associated thrombosis. the purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to estimate the natural history
of isolated hit following its recognition and treatment
(generally, discontinuation of heparin with or without
substitution by warfarin).
we identified a cohort of 62 patients with isolated hit.
overall, the 30-day thrombotic event rate was 52.8%.
the risk was similar whether the patients had been
managed by discontinuation of heparin alone (56%) or
substitution of heparin with warfarin (48%). a high
thrombotic event rate was evident soon after stopping
heparin: about 10% at 2 days, 35%  xxxd2274xxx  days, and almost
45% at 14 days. importantly, sudden death occurred in
three of the patients (5%), including autopsy-proven
pulmonary embolism in one patient.
recently, wallis et al. from loyola university [27••]
reported a retrospective cohort study of 113 patients in
whom heparin was discontinued because of clinically
suspected hit. these investigators also confirmed
the diagnosis serologically. they observed that 43 of

113 (38%) patients developed thrombosis despite
cessation of heparin; moreover, there was no difference in rate of thrombosis between patients in whom
the heparin was stopped within 48 hours of onset of
thrombocytopenia, or those in whom there was a
greater delay before stopping heparin (thrombotic
event-rate, 45% vs. 34% for early versus late heparin
cessation, respectively).
greinacher and colleagues performed two prospective
treatment cohort studies [37••,38•] for hit complicated
by thrombosis, using the antithrombin agent  xxxd2455xxx .
the authors recently reported a meta-analysis [39••] of
their two treatment studies that also sheds light on the
natural history of hit following cessation of heparin.
since their study protocol did not permit use of  xxxd2455xxx 
until serologic confirmation of hit had been obtained,
there was a mean delay of 1.7 days after stopping heparin
before the patients received  xxxd2455xxx . despite this relatively brief interval, the thrombotic event-rate was 6.1%
per day—that is, about 10% (1.7 x 6.1) prior to definitive
treatment with  xxxd2455xxx . this high rate of thrombosis
was similar to that observed in our retrospective cohort
study from five hospitals in hamilton (also about 10% at
2-day follow-up), even though the patient populations
differed (isolated hit versus predominance of hitassociated thrombosis) [25].

warfarin-induced venous limb gangrene
one possible explanation for the high risk for thrombosis is the profound hypercoagulable state (increased
thrombin generation) that persists for several days

bin generation is also believed to be an important factor
in the pathogenesis of venous limb gangrene that can
complicate the treatment of hit-associated dvt with
warfarin, or warfarin and ancrod. my colleagues and i
observed that warfarin treatment of hit-associated
dvt is a relatively high-risk situation (about 10%) for
progression to gangrene.
typically, patients with warfarin-induced venous limb
gangrene have a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (inr) that is greater than 3.5; the explanation
for this characteristic laboratory hallmark is a severe
reduction in  xxxg750xxx  that parallels the reduction in
protein c [14,42]. plasma studies suggest that this
syndrome is caused by a disturbance in procoagulantanticoagulant balance during warfarin treatment of hitassociated dvt: the warfarin causes a severe reduction
in protein c activity, while at the same time it fails to
reduce significantly prothrombin (factor ii) levels and
thereby fails to control thrombin generation. there is
also evidence that a similar pathogenesis underlies
progression of dvt to venous gangrene in other clinical
settings, such as cancer-associated venous limb
gangrene [42].
the frequency of this syndrome is unknown. several
case reports exist that are consistent with this
syndrome in patients with apparent hit [43–45]. a
recent study [46] did not observe any patients with
venous limb gangrene among 51 hit patients treated
with warfarin; however, only 16 patients had associated
dvt, and warfarin doses were generally less than used
in hamilton.

348 disorders of pulmonary circulation

cross-reactivity of low-molecular-weight
heparin
ironically, although lmwh is less likely to cause hit,
it has essentially a 100% in vitro cross-reactivity rate
using sensitive washed platelet assays [19,47,48].
further, the use of lmwh to treat patients with acute
or recent hit has almost a 50% risk for being associated with progressive or recurrent thrombocytopenia,
often with new thrombosis [40,41]. thus, lmwh is
generally considered contraindicated for the treatment
of hit [49,50].

treatment of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
most patients with clinically suspected, or serologically
confirmed, hit will require anticoagulation with a
rapidly acting agent, for at least one of two reasons: (1)
the ongoing need for anticoagulation for the initial
problem that led to heparin therapy that preceded hit;
(2) the occurrence of hit-associated venous or arterial
thrombosis. even for patients with isolated hit who
have no clinically-recognized thrombosis, however, the
view is emerging that alternative anticoagulation should
be given, based on the unfavorable natural history of
this condition [49,50]. my own practice is to give an
alternative agent, usually in therapeutic doses, until the
platelet count has recovered. further, i perform noninvasive imaging studies to rule out the most common
complication of hit (lower-limb dvt). this avoids the
possibility of discharging to home a patient with subclinical dvt who would otherwise have only received a
brief course of anticoagulation.
an alternate strategy for managing isolated hit was
described by tardy-poncet et al. [51•]. upon diagnosing isolated hit in 16 consecutive patients, these
investigators screened for dvt using duplex ultrasonography (dus). among the eight patients without
radiologic evidence for dvt, an alternative anticoagulant (danaparoid) was given in prophylactic doses.
among patients with dus-proven dvt, therapeuticdose danaparoid was given. only one patient died
with apparent hit-associated thrombosis using this
approach.

anticoagulants used to treat heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
currently, two anticoagulants are available in the united
states and the european union that are effective for the
prevention or treatment of thrombosis complicating
hit. these are the low-molecular-weight heparinoid
danaparoid sodium (orgaran, organon teknika corp.,
durham, nc) and the direct antithrombin  xxxd2455xxx 
( xxxd2455xxx , hoechst-marion roussel, kansas city, mo).
the reader is referred to recent reviews describing the
use of these agents to treat hit [40,50,52,53]. here,

issues relevant to the management of dvt and pe with
these agents are discussed.
danaparoid

danaparoid is a mixture of anticoagulant glycosaminoglycans (mostly heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate)
with predominant anti- xxxg741xxx  activity [52].
danaparoid does not interfere with either the activated
partial thromboplastin time (aptt) or inr; this makes
it easy to monitor overlapping oral anticoagulation
using the inr. danaparoid also has a relatively long
half-life (about 24 hr for its anti- xxxg741xxx  activity), and
there is no antidote for its anticoagulant effects.
although this can be a disadvantage in some clinical
settings (e.g., a patient who requires urgent surgery), in
most patients with venous thromboembolism this is
not an issue, and indeed the long overlap theoretically
helps avoid a situation of severe protein c reduction
without adequate inhibition of thrombin generation.
indeed, warfarin-induced venous limb gangrene has
not been reported in patients who have received overlapping danaparoid anticoagulation; nevertheless, i
recommend delaying warfarin use until the platelet
count has risen to at least 100 x 109/l, and only discontinuing the danaparoid after a minimum of 4 days of
overlapping warfarin use. further, the danaparoid
should not be stopped until the inr has reached the
target therapeutic range for at least 2 days and, ideally,
not until the platelet count has reached a stable
plateau.
although danaparoid is reported to have an in vitro
cross-reactivity rate ranging from about 15% (using
platelet-rich plasma aggregation assays [54]) to 35%
(using washed platelet activation assays or fluid-phase
enzyme-linked immunoassay [48]), the risk for in vivo
cross-reactivity appears to be much lower (< 5%).
moreover, laboratory cross-reactivity testing is not
standardized, does not predict in vivo cross-reactivity
[48,54], and can delay treatment. even patients who
experience a further platelet count fall during danaparoid treatment (whether due to cross-reactivity or to
other clinical problems) usually do not develop additional thrombotic events [15,48,55••]. in my opinion,
thrombocytopenia in the absence of thrombosis does
not necessarily warrant discontinuation of danaparoid.
danaparoid is the only alternative to heparin that has
been studied in a randomized controlled trial [56]. in
this study, danaparoid with overlapping warfarin proved
more effective than dextran and warfarin in patients
with severe hit-associated thrombosis: 92 versus 33%
(p < 0.001). a similar high success rate (approximately
90%) has also been observed in noncontrolled evaluation [55••,57], and in a historically controlled retrospective study [54].

danaparoid can be given safely to critically ill patients.
tardy-poncet [55••] reported that none of 42 consecutive critically ill patients who received danaparoid for
acute or previous hit developed new or progressive
thrombosis during danaparoid treatment. major hemorrhage occurred in only 6.5% of patients, usually attributable to other comorbid factors. thrombocytopenia
indicative of possible in vivo cross-reactivity was
reported in three (6.5%) patients, but this could have
been caused by other factors, as in vitro cross-reactivity
testing was negative.
 xxxd2455xxx 

 xxxd2455xxx  ( xxxd2455xxx ) is a derivative of hirudin, the
potent natural antithrombin produced by the salivary
gland of the medicinal leech, and is manufactured
using recombinant biotechnology [53].  xxxd2455xxx  is
approved for the treatment of thrombosis complicating
hit in both the united states and the european
union. two prospective cohort studies with historical
controls [37••,38•] suggested that it is effective for the
treatment of hit. a meta-analysis [39••] of these
studies indicated the importance of achieving the
target therapeutic range (aptt ranging from 1.5 to 2.5
times baseline): a subtherapeutic level of anticoagulation was associated with lack of therapeutic benefit,
whereas anticoagulation above the therapeutic range
had an unacceptably high bleeding risk (odds ratio, 6.0;
95% ci, 2.3–15.5), without any greater antithrombotic
benefit.
 xxxd2455xxx ’s anticoagulant effect must be carefully monitored, which can be performed simply using the aptt.
there may also be a mild prolongation of the inr in
some patients treated with  xxxd2455xxx . thus, overlap with
warfarin anticoagulation is more complicated than with
danaparoid. for example, if a patient develops hit
after having already received warfarin, there may already
be some elevation in the aptt; this means that
 xxxd2455xxx  underdosing will result if the effects of oral
anticoagulation are not reversed. further, after resolution of hit during  xxxd2455xxx  treatment, it is recommended that the dose of  xxxd2455xxx  be reduced to the
lower therapeutic range before commencing warfarin
[58]. although a potential advantage of  xxxd2455xxx  is its
short half-life (1.3 vs 24 hours for danaparoid), this is
usually not of practical significance in patients with
venous thromboembolism, as sudden interruption of
anticoagulation is usually not required.
hirudin is renally metabolized and excreted, and the
risk of drug accumulation and bleeding is high in
patients with renal failure. anticoagulant monitoring
should be continued even in patients with normal renal
function who appear to be stably anticoagulated with
hirudin; this is because formation of igg anti-hirudin

antibodies occurred in 46, 56, and 74% of patients in
three studies of  xxxd2455xxx  treatment for hit [59–61]. in
a few patients, there was a paradoxical increase in the
aptt [59,61], possibly because of reduced renal clearance of  xxxd2455xxx  caused by the antibodies [61].

conclusions
physicians who treat patients with dvt and pe should
have a basic understanding of hit, as misdiagnosis or
inappropriate treatment can have serious consequences.
the increasing appreciation of hit as a hypercoagulable state characterized by marked in vivo thrombin
generation helps explain its association with warfarininduced venous limb gangrene, and also provides a
rationale for treatment strategies that focus on control of
thrombin generation.
