atp-sensitive kⴙ (katp) channels are activated by a
diverse group of compounds known as  xxxg1232xxx  openers (pcos). here, we report functional studies
of the  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  selective pco 3-isopropylamino-7methoxy-4h-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (nnc
55-9216). we recorded cloned  xxxg1253xxx  currents
from inside-out patches excised from xenopus laevis
oocytes heterologously expressing  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a, or  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b, corresponding to the
␤-cell, cardiac, and smooth muscle types of the katp
channel. nnc 55-9216 reversibly activated  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  currents (ec50 ⴝ 16 ␮mol/l). this activation
was dependent on intracellular mgatp and was abolished by mutation of a single residue in the walker a
motifs of either nucleotide-binding domain of  xxxg19xxx .
the drug had no effect on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a or  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2b currents. we therefore used chimeras of  xxxg19xxx 
and sur2a to identify regions of  xxxg19xxx  involved in the
response to nnc 55-9216. activation was completely
abolished and significantly reduced by swapping
transmembrane domains 8 –11. the reverse chimera
consisting of sur2a with transmembrane domains
8 –11 and nbd2 consisting  xxxg19xxx  was activated by nnc
55-9216, indicating that these  xxxg19xxx  regions are important for drug activation. [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding
to membranes from hek293 cells transfected with
 xxxg19xxx  was displaced by nnc 55-9216 (ic50 ⴝ 105
␮mol/l), and this effect was impaired when nbd2 of
 xxxg19xxx  was replaced by that of sur2a. these results
suggest nnc 55-9216 is a  xxxg19xxx -selective pco that
requires structural determinants, which differ from
those needed for activation of the  xxxg1253xxx  by
pinacidil and cromakalim. the high selectivity of nnc
55-9216 may prove to be useful for studies of the

molecular mechanism of pco action. diabetes 51:
1896 –1906, 2002

tp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels are found in a
variety of tissues, including endocrine, muscle,
and neural tissues, where they couple the metabolic state of the cell to its electrical activity.
in pancreatic ␤-cells, katp channels link changes in blood
glucose concentration to insulin secretion (1); in cardiac
myocytes, increased  xxxg1253xxx  activity during ischemia
may protect against myocardial damage by shortening the
action potential (2); in vascular smooth muscle, katp
channels regulate vessel tone (3); and in skeletal muscle,
they contribute to the enhanced k⫹ efflux and fatigue
found during severe exercise (4). their physiological role
in neurones is not clearly established, but it is believed
that they modulate electrical activity (5), influence synaptic transmitter release (6), and contribute to the response
to cerebral ischemia (7).
the  xxxg1253xxx  is an octameric complex of two
different protein subunits, an inwardly rectifying k-channel, kir6.x, and a sulfonylurea receptor, surx (8 –14). the
former acts as the  xxxg1253xxx  pore, whereas sur is a
channel regulator that endows kir6.x with sensitivity to
drugs and mg nucleotides (15). katp channels in different
tissues are composed of different subunits (16). in most
cases, the pore comprises  xxxg1250xxx  (8,10,17), but in some
smooth muscles, it is kir6.1 (18). these kir subunits
associate with different types of sur. the ␤-cell katp
channel is composed of  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx  (8,10), the
cardiac type of sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx  (11), and the smooth
muscle type of sur2b combined with either kir6.1 or
 xxxg1250xxx  (17,18). both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b combinations are found in the brain (5,19). although wild-type
katp channels require both sur and kir6.x for functional
activity, a mutant form of  xxxg1250xxx  with a cooh-terminal
truncation of 26 or 36 amino acids ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c) is capable of
independent expression (15,20).  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c therefore provides a useful tool for studying the effects of drugs on the
pore-forming subunit of the  xxxg1253xxx .
katp channels are inhibited by sulfonylureas and activated by a chemically diverse group of compounds known
as  xxxg1232xxx  openers (pcos) (21–23). these
effects are mediated by interaction of the drug with the
sur subunit of the channel. it is well established that
different types of katp channels exhibit markedly different

sensitivities toward the various pco drugs. in particular,
pinacidil and cromakalim activate both native and cloned
cardiac ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) and smooth muscle ( xxxg1250xxx /
sur2b) types of  xxxg1253xxx , but have little or no effect
on ␤-cell ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ) channels (3,24 –26). conversely,
 xxxd1868xxx  strongly activates ␤-cell and smooth muscle
katp channels and has only a weak stimulatory effect on
cardiac katp channels (27–30).
nucleotides modulate  xxxg1253xxx  activity by interaction with both sur and  xxxg1250xxx  subunits. binding of atp or
adp to an unidentified site on  xxxg1250xxx  causes channel
closure (15,31). in contrast, mg nucleotides enhance katp
channel activity and decrease its sensitivity to atp by
interaction with the nucleotide-binding domains (nbds)
of the sur subunit (32–35). interaction of nucleotides
with the nbds of sur also modifies the response to pcos.
for example, stimulation of ␤-cell katp channels by  xxxd1868xxx  requires the presence of intracellular mg nucleotide
(36), and mutations in the nbds of  xxxg19xxx  abolish the
ability of mgatp to support  xxxd1868xxx  activation (33,35).
likewise, although pinacidil can activate cardiac katp
channels in the absence of added nucleotide (provided
that the drug is tested before channel run-down is pronounced) (21,37,38), both the rate of deactivation of
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents on removal of pinacidil and the
ability to measure binding of the analog [3h]p-1075 to
sur2a require the presence of mgatp and intact nbds
(38 – 40). one explanation for the mgatp dependence of
pco activation of katp channels is offered by the observation that pcos enhance the atpase activity of nbd2 of
 xxxg20xxx  (41). it is proposed that this promotes the duration
of the nucleotide-bound state at one or both nbds and
thereby stimulates  xxxg1253xxx  activation.
a ␤-cell–specific pco would be useful for treatment of
inoperable insulinoma and some forms of persistent hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia of infancy. furthermore, it has
been proposed that ␤-cell “rest” induced by pcos might be
beneficial in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (42– 44).
␤-cell–specific pcos have also been suggested for prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity (45– 47). by combining
structural elements from pinacidil and  xxxd1868xxx  and by
reducing the conformational flexibility compared with
pinacidil, a range of novel  xxxd1868xxx  analogs have been
synthesized and shown to inhibit insulin release from
pancreatic islets (48 –51). in screening tests, the compound 3-isopropylamino-7-methoxy-4h-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (nnc 55-9216 or bpdz 216) (fig. 1) was a
more potent inhibitor of insulin release from rat pancreatic islets than  xxxd1868xxx  and had no significant myorelaxant action on rat aortic rings in vitro (data on file at novo
nordisk and the free university of brussels). these results suggested nnc 55-9216 might show specificity for the
␤-cell  xxxg1253xxx . in this study, we investigated the
effect of nnc 55-9216 on recombinant katp channels
composed of  xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx  (␤-cell type), sur2a
(cardiac/skeletal muscle type), or sur2b (smooth muscle
type), heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes. a
chimeric approach was used to investigate the domains of
sur that are involved in nnc 55-9216 –induced katp
channel activation. this identified a novel pco interaction
site in the second set of transmembrane domains of  xxxg19xxx .

research design and methods
molecular biology. mouse  xxxg1250xxx  (genbank no. d50581) (8,10), rat  xxxg19xxx 
(genbank no. l40624) (9), rat sur2a (genbank no. d83598) (11), and sur2b
(genbank no. d86038) (17) cdnas were cloned in the pbf vector. a truncated
form of  xxxg1250xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36), which lacks the cooh-terminal 36 amino acids
and forms functional channels in the absence of sur, was prepared as
previously described (15). sur chimeras containing different segments of
 xxxg19xxx  and sur2a were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques (52). the chimeras were composed of the following segments, in which
the numbers refer to sequences of  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a, as appropriate. chimeras
based on  xxxg19xxx  are denoted sur12-a to sur12-e, and chimeras based on
sur2a are denoted sur21-a to sur21-e: sur12-a: (1-662; xxxg19xxx )-(655-849;
sur2a)-(871-1581; xxxg19xxx ); sur12-b: (1-1284; xxxg19xxx )-(1249-1545;sur2a);
sur12-c: (1-662; xxxg19xxx )-(655-849;sur2a)-(871-1284; xxxg19xxx )-(1249-1545;

mutagenesis of individual amino acids was performed using the altered
sites ii system (promega). capped mrna was prepared using the mmessage mmachine large-scale in vitro transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx),
as previously described (53). when chimeric surs were coexpressed with
 xxxg1250xxx  in xenopus oocytes, current amplitudes were similar to those found for
wild-type  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels.
oocyte collection. female xenopus laevis were anesthetized with ms222 (2
g/l added to the water). one ovary was removed via a mini-laparotomy, the
incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. after the wound
had completely healed, the second ovary was removed in a similar operation,
and the animal was then killed by decapitation while under anesthesia.
immature stage–v-vi oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 1.0 mg/ml
collagenase (type v; sigma) and manually defolliculated. oocytes were either
injected with ⬃1 ng  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 mrna or coinjected with ⬃0.1 ng  xxxg1250xxx 
mrna and ⬃2 ng mrna encoding wild-type or chimeric sur. the final
injection volume was 50 nl/oocyte. isolated oocytes were maintained in
barth’s solution and studied 1–5 days after injection (53).

inside-out patches in response to a series of voltage ramps from ⴚ110 to 100 mv from oocytes coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or
sur2b or expressing  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36. mgatp and nnc 55-9216 were added to the intracellular solution as indicated by the bars.
electrophysiology. patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass and had resistances of 250 –500 k⍀ when filled with pipette solution.
macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised inside-out patches at
a holding potential of 0 mv and at 20 –24°c (53). currents were evoked by
repetitive 3-s voltage ramps from ⫺110 mv to 100 mv and recorded using an
epc7 patch-clamp amplifier (list electronik, darmstadt, germany). they
were filtered at 0.2 khz, digitized at 0.4 khz using a digidata 1200 interface,
and analyzed using pclamp software (axon instruments, foster city, ca).
the pipette (external) solution contained (mmol/l): 140 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 2.6
cacl2, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with koh). the intracellular (bath) solution
contained (mmol/l): 110 kcl, 1.4 mgcl2, 10 egta, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with
koh; final [k⫹] ⬃140 mmol/l). nnc 55-9216 (synthesized at the department of
medicinal chemistry, university of liege) was prepared as a 200 mmol/l stock
solution in dmso. in control experiments, the maximal dmso concentration
applied (0.15%) was without effect on the  xxxg1253xxx  current. solutions
containing atp, adp, or atp␥s were made fresh each day. the ph of the
solution was readjusted after addition of the drug and/or nucleotide. rapid
exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning the patch in the mouth of
one of a series of adjacent inflow pipes placed in the bath.
preparation of sur-expressing membranes. hek293 cells were grown to
60 –70% confluency in 13-cm petri dishes and transfected using fugene 6
(roche diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. confluent
dishes of transfected hek293 cells were washed once in pbs, harvested with
a cell scraper, and centrifuged at 1,000g in pbs for 5 min. all subsequent
procedures were performed at ⬃0°c. the supernatant was removed, and cells
were resuspended in ice-cold buffer (buffer 1: 30 mmol/l hepes and 2 mmol/l
mgcl2, ph 7.4 with naoh), homogenized with an ultra turrax t25 homogenizer, and centrifuged at 48,000g for 15 min. the pellet was resuspended, and
the homogenization step was repeated. the final pellet was resuspended in
buffer 1 (500 –1,500 ␮l per dish) with 250 mmol/l sucrose. the membrane
solution was aliquoted and stored at ⫺80°c for later use in binding assays.
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding. membranes were thawed, placed on ice, and
diluted in ice-cold buffer (30 mmol/l hepes, 2 mmol/l mgcl2, and 2 mmol/l
na2atp; ph 7.4 adjusted with naoh) to a concentration of 200 – 800 ␮g/ml
protein. the radioligand [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (52.00 ci/mmol) (nen, boston,
ma) was added to a final concentration of 1 nmol/l. [3h] xxxd2215xxx  was
displaced with increasing concentrations of nnc 55-9216 (1–1,000 ␮mol/l).
samples were incubated at 37°c for 1 h. incubation was terminated by
1898

filtration through whatman gf/b filters, and the filters were washed three
times with 154 mmol/l of ice-cold nacl. ultima gold was used as the
scintillation fluid for counting 3h decay. nonspecific binding was determined
using 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd2204xxx  (final concentration). the ratio of nonspecific
binding to total [3h] xxxd2215xxx  bound was always ⬍0.15, and the amount
of total [3h] xxxd2215xxx , bound as a function of protein concentration, was
linear over the protein concentration range used (200 – 800 ␮g/ml).
data analysis. the slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line
to the current-voltage relation between ⫺20 and ⫺100 mv. conductance was
measured from an average of five consecutive ramps in each solution.
responses to nnc 55-9216 or nucleotides were expressed relative to the
conductance measured in control solution without added nnc 55-9216 or
nucleotides. concentration-response curves were constructed by expressing
the conductance in the presence of nnc 55-9216 (g) as a fraction of that in
control solution (gc). the following equation was then fitted to the data (54):
1⫺l

where g and gc are the slope conductances in the presence of nnc 55-9216
and in control solution, respectively, [nnc 55-9216] is the concentration of
nnc 55-9216, ec50 is the nnc 55-9216 concentration at which activation is
half maximal, h is the hill coefficient (slope factor), and l is the maximum
activation. data were fit using microcal origin software.
to measure the time course of the nnc 55-9216 response, patches were
held at ⫺60 mv and macroscopic currents were recorded in response to
application of the drug.
in the binding experiments, a modified form of the hill equation was used
to fit the data:

results

we examined the ability of nnc 55-9216 to activate the
different types of recombinant katp channels by recording
macroscopic currents in inside-out membrane patches
excised from xenopus oocytes coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and
either  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b or expressing  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36
alone. in all cases, the currents were very small in the
cell-attached configuration but increased dramatically
when the patch was excised into nucleotide-free solution,
consistent with the idea that in the intact oocyte, the katp
channel is blocked by cytoplasmic nucleotides such as
atp. because pcos usually require mgatp to support
their action, we tested nnc 55-9216 in the presence of
100 ␮mol/l mgatp. this atp concentration blocked
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents by ⬃40% and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by
⬃83% (figs. 2 and 3).
figure 2 shows that when 100 ␮mol/l nnc 55-9216 was
added to the intracellular membrane surface, it largely
reversed the block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents produced by
100 ␮mol/l mgatp but had no effect on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a,
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b, or  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents. the concentrationresponse relation for nnc 55-9216 activation of  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  currents measured in the presence of 100 ␮mol/l
mgatp is shown in fig. 4. the data were fit by the hill
equation (equation 1) with an ec50 of 16 ⫾ 8 ␮mol/l and a
hill coefficient of 0.8 ⫾ 0.2 (n ⫽ 6 –16). the fact that the
hill coefficient is close to unity suggests that the binding of
a single molecule of the drug is sufficient to cause channel
activation. in all subsequent experiments, nnc 55-9216
was used at a concentration of 100 ␮mol/l because this
appeared to produce a near-maximal response.

interactions with mg-nucleotides. we explored
whether mgatp is required to support activation of  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  currents by nnc 55-9216 by testing the efficacy of
the drug in the absence of added nucleotide (fig. 3, white
columns). similar experiments were carried out using
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b, and  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36. as fig. 3
shows, the drug failed to activate all four types of katp
channel in the absence of mgatp.
the nucleotide diphosphate mgadp is able to support
 xxxd1868xxx  activation of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (33). furthermore,
although  xxxd1868xxx  is relatively ineffective at activating
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a in the presence of mgatp, the drug
produces reliable activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels
in the presence of mgadp (28). we therefore tested the
effects of nnc 55-9216 on all four types of  xxxg1253xxx 
in the presence of 10 ␮mol/l mgadp. this nucleotide
concentration was chosen because higher concentrations produce near-maximal activation of the channel,
which may mask any stimulatory effect of the drug
itself. figure 3 shows that nnc 55-9216 was unable to
activate  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b, or
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channels when mgadp was present. nnc
55-9216 (100 ␮mol/l) was also tested under conditions
where  xxxd1868xxx  activates  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels [i.e.,
in the presence of 100 ␮mol/l mgadp plus 100 ␮mol/l
mgatp (28)] but no stimulatory effect was observed on
currents through  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels (n ⫽ 3, data
not shown). these data indicate that the presence of
intracellular mgatp, rather than mgadp, is required for
channel activation by nnc 55-9216 and provide additional support that the drug is selective for the ␤-cell
type of  xxxg1253xxx .
we next investigated the mechanism by which mgatp

55-9216 in the presence of 100 ␮mol/l mgatp, in the
presence of 100 ␮mol/l atp but without mg2⫹, and in the
presence of 100 ␮mol/l mgatp␥s. as has been observed
for  xxxd1868xxx  (36,55), mg2⫹ was required for the ability of
atp to support channel activation by nnc 55-9216. although this result is consistent with the idea that atp
hydrolysis is needed for nnc 55-9216 activation, we
cannot exclude the alternative possibility that mgatp, but
not atp alone, is able to interact with the channel. figure
5a also shows that atp␥s was able to substitute partially
for atp, albeit with lower efficacy (40% activation compared with 75%). there was no difference in the rate of
activation by 100 ␮mol/l nnc 55-9216 in the presence of
atp␥s or atp, but the rate of deactivation of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
currents on removal of the drug was significantly slower in
atp solution (fig. 5b). the mean time constants were
12.6 ⫾ 0.7 s (n ⫽ 8) and 6.4 ⫾ 0.8 s (n ⫽ 5) for solutions
containing 100 ␮mol/l mgatp or mgatp␥s, respectively.
this indicates that the off-rate of the drug is slower when
atp is present, a finding that may reflect a slower rate of
hydrolysis of atp␥s compared with atp, a reduced
binding affinity of atp␥s, or a difference in the extent of
coupling between binding/hydrolysis and channel activation.
to further explore the role of mgatp in channel activation by nnc 55-9216, we made mutations in the nbds of
 xxxg19xxx . specifically, we mutated lysine 719 to alanine [ xxxg19xxx (k719a)] and lysine 1384 to methionine
[ xxxg19xxx (k1384m)]. these residues lie in the walker a
motifs of nbd1 and nbd2, respectively, and, in other
atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, their mutation
impairs atp binding and/or hydrolysis. coexpression of
either of these mutant sur1s with  xxxg1250xxx  produced currents of similar amplitude to wild-type currents (fig. 6). as
previously reported, the currents were slightly more atp
sensitive (33). they were also not activated by nnc
1900

55-9216, even in the presence of mgatp. these results
imply that the ability of mgatp to support channel activation by nnc 55-9216 results from interaction of the
nucleotide with the nbds of  xxxg19xxx . furthermore, both
nbds must be intact for channel activation. in this
respect, nnc 55-9216 differs from  xxxd1868xxx , which is still
able to induce some activation of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx (k1384m)
currents (33).
identification of the nnc 55-9216 binding site. as
described above, nnc 55-9216 activates  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  but
not  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels (figs. 2 and 3). we used this
difference to identify the region of  xxxg19xxx  that confers
sensitivity to the drug by constructing chimeric surs
based on either  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a (fig. 7a). these chimeric
surs were coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx , and the ability of 100
␮mol/l nnc 55-9216 to activate the expressed currents in
the presence of 100 ␮mol/l mgatp was then examined
(fig. 7b).
transfer of nbd1 of  xxxg20xxx  into  xxxg19xxx  (chimera 12-a) had
little effect, whereas substitution of nbd2 from  xxxg20xxx  to
 xxxg19xxx  (12-b) markedly reduced nnc 55-9216 stimulation.
moreover, when both nbd1 and -2 of  xxxg19xxx  were replaced
with those of  xxxg20xxx  (12-c), the effect of the drug was
completely abolished. these findings suggest that nbd2 of
 xxxg19xxx  is essential for nnc 55-9216 activation. we next
investigated the effects of replacing various transmembrane helices of  xxxg19xxx  with the equivalent region of
sur2a. figure 7b also shows that although transfer of
tms 13–16 from sur2a to  xxxg19xxx  (12-e) confers pinacidil
sensitivity on  xxxg19xxx  (37,56,57), it did not affect the stimulatory effect of nnc 55-9216. in contrast, the efficacy of
nnc 55-9216 was approximately halved when tms 8 –11 of
 xxxg19xxx  were replaced with the corresponding tms of
sur2a (12-d). this suggests that tms 8 –11 are important
for nnc 55-9216 sensitivity.
we also constructed chimeric surs based on sur2a, in
which the equivalent region of  xxxg19xxx  replaced various
domains in sur2a. swapping tms 1–7 (21-c), 8 –11 (21-d),
or 13–16 (21-e) did not confer nnc 55-9216 sensitivity on
sur2a. likewise, transfer of either nbd2, or both nbds,
of  xxxg19xxx  into sur2a did not render nnc 55-9216 capable
of activating the  xxxg1253xxx  current. however, when
both tms 8 –11 and nbd2 were transferred from  xxxg19xxx 
into sur2a (21-f), a significant activation by nnc 55-9216
was seen (36 ⫾ 7%, n ⫽ 9), thus confirming the importance
of these domains for nnc 55-9216 activation.
because nnc 55-9216 shares some structural similarities with the inhibitory sulfonylurea  xxxd3394xxx  (fig. 1),
we examined whether a single amino acid mutation that
abolishes  xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity ( xxxg19xxx -s1238y) (52) was
able to abolish activation by nnc 55-9216. wild-type and
mutant katp channels, preblocked by 100 ␮mol/l mgatp,
were activated by nnc 55-9216 (100 ␮mol/l) to similar
extents: to 75 ⫾ 7% (n ⫽ 33) and 61 ⫾ 15% (n ⫽ 5) of
control (nucleotide-free solution), respectively. this result
indicates that the drug interaction sites for  xxxd3394xxx 
and nnc 55-9216 are not identical, a view also supported
by the fact that tms 13–16 of  xxxg19xxx , which form part of the
 xxxd3394xxx -binding site (52), do not appear to be involved
in nnc 55-9216 activation.

hek293 cells transiently transfected with  xxxg19xxx , or with
the chimeras 12-a or 12-b (consisting of  xxxg19xxx  with either
nbd1 or nbd2 of sur2a, respectively). all experiments
were carried out in the presence of 100 ␮mol/l mgatp,
because pco binding to sur requires the presence of
mgatp (58). figure 8 shows that nnc 55-9216 dosedependently displaced [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx ,
with an ic50 of 103 ⫾ 11 ␮mol/l (n ⫽ 6). a similar result
was obtained for displacement of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to the chimera 12-a by nnc 55-9216 (fig. 8). however,
nnc 55-9216 was less effective at displacing [3h] xxxd2215xxx  from chimera 12-b. thus, swapping nbd1 of  xxxg19xxx 
for that of sur2a is without obvious effect, whereas
replacement of nbd2 of  xxxg19xxx  by that of sur2a has a
marked effect. this is consistent with the results of the
electrophysiological experiments.
it was not possible to dissolve nnc 55-9216 at concentrations ⬎1 mmol/l; hence, the full concentration-response
relationship for the 12-b chimera could not be obtained. it
is not clear from the available data whether the displacement curve corresponds to a single curve or a multimodal
curve, or whether incomplete displacement of binding
occurs at saturating concentrations of the pco. if the
shifted curve is a result of binding of the pco at a single
site, the data can be a fit with an ic50 of 730 ⫾ 25 ␮mol/l
and h ⫽ 0.43 ⫾ 0.07 (n ⫽ 5). alternatively, the data are also
consistent with the idea that nnc 55-9216 is only able to
displace a maximum of 50% of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding.
diabetes, vol. 51, june 2002

in this case, the ic50 was 51 ⫾ 30 ␮mol/l and h ⫽ 0.76 ⫾
0.21 (n ⫽ 5). whichever is correct, it is clear that replacement of nbd2 of  xxxg19xxx  by that of sur2a reduces the ability
of nnc 55-9216 to displace [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding.
discussion

the results reported here demonstrate that nnc 55-9216
activates  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , but not  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a or  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2b currents, by interaction with the  xxxg19xxx  subunit of
the  xxxg1253xxx . they also imply that the drug will
stimulate native katp channels in pancreatic ␤-cells but
not in cardiac or smooth muscles. this selectivity is
particularly interesting in view of the fact that the drug
shares some structural similarity with  xxxd1868xxx , which
interacts with katp channels containing sur2a and
sur2b as well as  xxxg19xxx  (28,59).
activation of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by nnc 55-9216 is
dependent on the presence of intracellular mgatp. the
adenine dinucleotide mgadp is unable to substitute for
mgatp, and in this respect, the nucleotide requirements of
nnc 55-9216 differ from those of  xxxd1868xxx  (fig. 1), which
is supported by mgadp (28). the lack of effect of mgadp,
and of atp in the absence of mg2⫹, suggests that mgatp
hydrolysis might be needed for nnc 55-9216 activation.
the ability of mgatp␥s to support the action of the
 xxxd1868xxx  analog, albeit to a lesser extent than mgatp, is
also consistent with a role for atp hydrolysis. in this case,

55-9216 were added to the intracellular solution as indicated by the bars. b: mean macroscopic slope conductances (g) in the presence of 100

without drug or nucleotide (gc). the numbers above the columns indicate the number of patches, and the vertical bars indicate 1 sem.

the faster off-rate of the drug in atp␥s solution might also
be explained by a slower hydrolysis of mgatp␥s (compared with mgatp). however, we cannot exclude the
possibility that mgatp binding per se (rather than mgatp
binding with subsequent hydrolysis) is sufficient to support nnc 55-9216 stimulation, and that the slower off-rate
of the drug in the presence of mgatp results because the
allosteric effect on drug binding differs for mgatp␥s and
mgatp.
mutagenesis experiments suggest that mgatp supports
nnc 55-9216 activation by interaction with the nbds of
 xxxg19xxx . both nbds are required because mutation of a
single lysine residue in the walker a motif of either nbd1
or nbd2 was sufficient to abolish the effect of the drug. in
other abc transporters, mutation of the walker a lysine
prevents atp hydrolysis without markedly altering atp
binding (60,61). similar mutations in  xxxg19xxx , however,
decrease atp binding (62,63). our mutagenesis experiments, therefore, cannot distinguish whether atp binding
or hydrolysis is required for nnc 55-9216 activation.
the experiments using  xxxg19xxx /2a chimeras highlight the
importance of several domains of  xxxg19xxx  for channel activation by nnc 55-9216. first, it is clear that nbd2 plays a
particularly important role because substitution of this
1902

domain by the equivalent region of sur2a abolished the
effect of nnc 55-9216. this is in sharp contrast to  xxxd1868xxx , which activates equally well when nbd2 of  xxxg19xxx  is
replaced by that of sur2a (27). it is possible that the
nbds of  xxxg19xxx  cooperate in nucleotide binding (and/or
transduction), that this interaction is needed for nucleotides to support nnc 55-9216 activation, and that nbd2 of
sur2a is unable to interact with that of nbd1. second,
replacement of tms 8 –11 of  xxxg19xxx  with the equivalent
region of sur2a abolished the action of the drug. there
are three principal mechanisms by which manipulation of
tms 8 –11 might influence the stimulatory effect of nnc
55-9216. first, it may disrupt the drug binding site; second,
it may influence the coupling mechanism by which drug
binding is transduced into channel opening; and third, it
may impair the ability of mgatp to support nnc 55-9216
binding and/or activation. the available data do not allow
us to distinguish between these possibilities. we were able
to transfer some of the activity of nnc 55-9216 from  xxxg19xxx 
to sur2a by substituting both tms 8 –11 and nbd2 from
 xxxg19xxx  into sur2a. the efficacy of nnc 55-9216 activation
is reduced in this chimera, but the presence of some
activation confirms that tms 8 –11 of  xxxg19xxx  are required
for proper nnc 55-9216 function.

data point is the mean of 5– 6 duplicate determinations that were
corrected for nonspecific binding and normalized to the maximal
specific binding. the curves are fitted with the hill equation (equation
2) using the following values:  xxxg19xxx : l ⴝ 0, ic50 ⴝ 103 ␮mol/l, and h ⴝ
0.53 (n ⴝ 6) (f, solid line); chimera 12-a: l ⴝ 0, ic50 ⴝ 142 ␮mol/l, and
h ⴝ 0.48 (n ⴝ 6) (f, dashed line); and chimera 12-b: l ⴝ 0.46, ic50 ⴝ
51 ␮mol/l, and h ⴝ 0.76 (n ⴝ 5) (œ, dotted line.).

the sur subunit consists of 17 tms arranged in three
groups of 5, 6, and 6 (64,65). previous studies have
demonstrated that a range of pcos that show specificity
for  xxxg20xxx , including pinacidil, cromakalim, and nicorandil,
interact with the third set of tms. chimera studies suggest
that pinacidil and p1075 interact with tms 13–16 of sur2a
(38,56,57). mutation of two residues within tm 17 [sur2a
(l1249t) and sur2a(t1253m)] abolishes activation of
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents by the cromakalim analog sr47063,
whereas the reverse mutation  xxxg19xxx (m1290t) confers sensitivity to p1075, rilmakalim, and sr47063 on  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx (m1290t) (25). these mutations did not abolish
activation by  xxxd1868xxx , however, suggesting that it may
interact with a different site. our studies now identify the
presence of a novel interaction site for pcos that lies in
the second set of transmembranes of  xxxg19xxx  (specifically
tms 8 –11). it is possible that in addition to nnc 55-9216,
 xxxd1868xxx  may interact with (part of) this site. it is
interesting that this region lies in the cooh-terminal part
of the second set of transmembranes because in the
related  xxxg22xxx   xxxg12xxx , drug
binding sites are located in an equivalent position in both
the second and third set of tms.
the ability of nnc 55-9216 to displace [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx  in the presence of mgatp
suggests several possibilities. first, the binding sites for
these drugs may overlap, or they may be able to influence
each other allosterically. second, it is possible that the
pco affects [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding indirectly, for example, by stabilizing atp binding to  xxxg19xxx , which in turn
reduces [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding. the importance of
nbd2 for this effect is demonstrated by the reduced
displacement that is observed when nbd2 of sur2a
replaces that of  xxxg19xxx , a finding that supports the results of
the electrophysiological experiments. it seems most likely
that interaction of mgatp with nbd2 is essential for nnc
55-9216 binding, but we cannot exclude the possibility that
1904

it is instead involved in allosteric coupling of pco and
sulfonylurea binding sites.
in conclusion, nnc 55-9216 is the first pco that shows
significant selectivity for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels (the ␤-cell
type of katp channels). it is also more potent than
 xxxd1868xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 65 ␮mol/l for  xxxd1868xxx  [10] versus 16
␮mol/l for nnc 55-9216). of particular interest, is the
finding that nnc 55-9216 appears to interact with a
different region of sur than many other pcos (pinacidil,
cromakalim, etc.). this suggests that it may form the basis
for the development of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx –selective pcos that
are devoid of the side effects (e.g., edema and hirsutism)
associated with  xxxd1868xxx . such compounds could be used
to treat patients suffering from diseases of excessive
insulin secretion, such as insulinoma or certain types of
persistent hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia of infancy.
they may also be of value in the treatment of both type 1
(42– 44) and type 2 diabetes (45) as well as obesity (46).
finally, nnc 55-9216 may provide a useful pharmacological tool for studies on the molecular mechanisms of pco
action and for studies of the relationship between the
structure and function of sulfonylurea receptors.
