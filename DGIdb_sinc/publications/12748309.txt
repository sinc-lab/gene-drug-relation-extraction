 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  in preclinical models of human small cell lung cancer.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of the indolinone kinase inhibitor  xxxd3264xxx  against the receptor  xxxg2198xxx   xxxg1279xxx  in vitro and in vivo, examine the role of  xxxg1279xxx  in small cell lung cancer (sclc), and anticipate clinical utility of  xxxd3264xxx  in sclc.  xxxd3264xxx  is an oral, multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with direct antitumor and antiangiogenic activity through targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1710xxx ),  xxxg2413xxx  receptor,  xxxg1279xxx , and  xxxg801xxx  receptors. treatment of the  xxxg1279xxx -expressing sclc-derived nci-h526 cell line in vitro with  xxxd3264xxx  resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of stem cell factor-stimulated  xxxg1279xxx   xxxd1075xxx  levels and proliferation. the biological significance of  xxxg1279xxx  inhibition was evaluated in vivo by treating mice bearing s.c. nci-h526 tumors with  xxxd3264xxx  or another structurally unrelated  xxxg1279xxx  inhibitor, sti571 (gleevec), which is also known to inhibit bcr-abl and pdgfrbeta.  xxxd3264xxx  treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition, whereas inhibition from sti571 treatment was less dramatic. both compounds reduced phospho- xxxg1279xxx  levels in nci-h526 tumors, with a greater reduction by  xxxd3264xxx , correlating with efficacy. likewise, phospho-pdgfrbeta levels contributed by tumor stroma and with known involvement in angiogenesis were strongly inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx  and less so by sti571. because platinum-based chemotherapy is part of the standard of care for sclc,  xxxd3264xxx  was combined with cisplatin, and significant tumor growth delay was measured compared with either agent alone. these results expand the profile of  xxxd3264xxx  as a  xxxg1279xxx  signaling inhibitor and suggest that  xxxd3264xxx  may have clinical potential in the treatment of sclc via direct antitumor activity mediated via  xxxg1279xxx  as well as tumor angiogenesis via  xxxg2413xxx  receptor  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfrbeta.
