[new aspects on the mode of action of cardiac glycosides].  a dissociation of the therapeutic from the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides has repeatedly been described. whereas it is generally accepted that the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides are based on an inhibition of the na+-k+-atpase, the mechanism of action of therapeutic concentrations of cardiac glycosides still remains uncertain. to test the hypothesis, that cardiac glycosides might be transported into a distinct compartment of the myocardium with the na+-k-atpase acting as a carrier, the interaction of some inhibitors of this enzyme ( xxxd1884xxx , dihydroouabain, cassaine,  xxxd2684xxx , p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoate,  xxxd2049xxx , spironolactone) with ouabain was studied at different levels of  xxxd2799xxx  actions: myocardial function, cardiac uptake and subcellular distribution and binding to the na+-k+-atpase. the following results were obtained: all cardioactive drugs ( xxxd2049xxx  and spironolactone showed no such effects) reduced dose-dependently the inotropic action of ouabain and in high concentrations increased its toxicity. the same drugs inhibited dose-dependently the cardiac uptake of ouabain without affecting the subcellular distribution pattern of ouabain. the binding of ouabain to the na+-k+-atpase was influenced in a similar way by these drugs, showing a competitive type of interaction with  xxxd1884xxx , dihydroouabain and cassaine and a non-competitive mechanism with  xxxd2684xxx  and  xxxd2843xxx . these results support the concept of a  xxxd2799xxx -atpase interaction as a basis for the therapeutic action of these drugs. this may be explained either by a direct influence of cardiac glycosides on the atpase activity and/or by a carrier mediated  xxxd2799xxx -transport into a distinct compartment of the myocardial cell.
