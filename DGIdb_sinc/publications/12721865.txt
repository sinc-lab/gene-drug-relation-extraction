[cabergoline in the treatment of parkinson's disease].  cabergoline (1-[(6-allelylergolin-8 beta-yl)carbonyl]-1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethyl-urea) is a new agonist of the d2 dopaminergic receptors used in the treatment of parkinson's disease. cabergoline is characterized by unique pharmacologic properties, such as its long plasma half-life (about 68 hours), which allows for once a day administration. cabergoline is well tolerated, as has been shown in several clinical trials. based on the information available, we suggest that cabergoline produces an improvement in the symptoms of parkinson's disease similar to those produced by other dopaminergic agonists. cabergoline monotherapy, when used in previously untreated patients, is an appropriate option for the symptomatic treatment of parkinson's disease. cabergoline improves motor symptoms, delays the presentation of levodopa-induced motor complications, and diminishes the amount of levodopa required for the control of the symptoms. we suggest that cabergoline is an adequate adjuvant treatment for parkinson' disease. there is improvement in motor symptoms (without substantially increased dyskinesias), reduced severity and duration of the wearing-off period, and diminished need for levodopa. cabergoline can also be useful in the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with advanced parkinson's disease such as nocturnal akinesia and dystonia. however, additional studies on cabergoline's effects in nocturnal disturbances associated with parkinson's disease are still required. cabergoline is a well tolerated drug. its side effects are seen mainly in the digestive and nervous system (central and peripheral). the efficacy of cabergoline in comparison to other dopaminergic agonists should be tested in future clinical studies.
