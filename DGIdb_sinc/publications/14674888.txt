 summary 
 
 background   inorganic arsenic is an environmental contaminant and is associated with the increased risk of human skin cancer. arsenic has been reported to activate or inhibit a variety of cellular signalling pathways which has effects on cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. however, the molecular mechanisms of these arsenic‐induced biological effects are not completely understood. 
 objectives   to understand the molecular basis for the mode of action of arsenicals, we examined the effect of arsenite and arsenate on the activation of mitogen‐activated protein kinases (mapk) and the upstream signalling cascade in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (nhek). 
 methods   nhek were exposed to arsenite or arsenate. western blot analysis was performed to determine the activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (erk) 1/2, c‐jun n‐terminal kinases (jnk), p38, and mapk or erk kinases (mek) 1/2.  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of its adaptor proteins, shc and grb2, to egfr were detected by immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. 
 results   both arsenicals activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, which are most highly activated in response to mitogenic stimulation, in addition to jnk and p38, which show greater activation in response to cellular stresses. the kinetics of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation differed from those of jnk and p38 activation. both arsenicals transiently activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 prior to jnk and p38 activation.  xxxg1361xxx /2, upstream kinases of  xxxg1369xxx /2, were also activated by arsenicals with similar time kinetics to that of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. to investigate a signalling pathway leading to activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2– xxxg1369xxx /2, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr and shc adapter protein. both arsenicals stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr and shc. after arsenical treatment, shc immunoprecipitates contained coprecipitated egfr and grb2, suggesting that both arsenicals induce the assembly of egfr–shc–grb2 complexes. both the  xxxd1256xxx  tyrphostin ag1478 and anti‐egfr blocking antibody markedly attenuated  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation induced by arsenicals, but did not affect jnk and p38 activation. 
 conclusions   our data indicate that both arsenite and arsenate activate the egfr–shc–grb2– xxxg1361xxx /2– xxxg1369xxx /2 signalling cascade in nhek. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 it is well established that exposure to inorganic arsenicals, primarily through occupational and environmental routes, causes characteristic skin alterations, including hyperkeratosis and skin cancer. 1  arsenic has been reported to activate or inhibit a number of cellular signalling pathways leading to alterations in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. 2 - 5  however, the precise molecular mechanisms of these arsenic‐induced biological effects are not fully understood.
          
 the mitogen‐activated protein kinases (mapk), including extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (erk)1/2, stress‐activated c‐jun n‐terminal kinases (jnk) and p38, are important regulatory proteins through which extracellular signals are transduced into intracellular events. 6  it is known that activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is generally associated with proliferation, whereas activation of the jnk and p38 pathways is associated with the induction of apoptosis by various physical and chemical stresses. however, the role of each mapk pathway is determined by multiple factors including cell type, the particular isoform of the activated kinases, the duration of kinase activation and other regulatory signals. several published studies demonstrate that the complex dose‐dependent and cell‐type‐specific outcomes of arsenic exposure involve the differential activation of mapk pathways. in the jb6 mouse epidermal cell line, for example, low doses of arsenic exposure induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 stimulation associated with cell transformation, 7  whereas exposure to higher arsenic concentrations resulted in jnk activation and apoptosis induction. 8 
 exposure to inorganic arsenic is generally in the form of either arsenite (trivalent arsenic) or arsenate (pentavalent arsenic). the predominant form of arsenic in nature is arsenate, yet most toxicological and biological studies have focused on arsenite. 9  the basic mechanisms of action for the two species vary, as arsenite is extremely thiol‐reactive, whereas arsenate is similar in structure to phosphate and therefore competes with phosphate in phosphotransfer reactions. kachinskas  et al . 10  have shown that arsenate, but not arsenite, greatly suppresses the expression of a specific marker of keratinocyte differentiation,  xxxg1217xxx , at the level of transcription in malignant human keratinocytes. in contrast, cavigelli  et al . 11  reported that arsenite, but not arsenate, stimulates activator protein‐1 transcriptional activity by inhibiting a jnk phosphatase in hela s3 cells. furthermore, porter  et al . 12  have shown that both arsenite and arsenate activate jnk by utilizing different, as well as overlapping, signal transduction pathways in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. understanding the differential toxic mechanisms and biological effects of arsenite and arsenate is critically important in assessing the risk from arsenic exposure.
          
 in this study, we investigated the activation of mapk in response to arsenite and arsenate in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (nhek). mapk activation varies with both the stimulus and the cell type. assefa  et al . 13  reported that nhek and the transformed human keratinocyte cell line hacat responded differently to ultraviolet (uv) b or  xxxg681xxx  (egf). we therefore selected nhek as a model system for this study. we report here that  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38 are activated by both arsenite and arsenate. the kinetics of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation differ from those of jnk and p38 in that activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is transient and occurs prior to activation of jnk and p38. to characterize further the upstream signalling events in  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in nhek exposed to two types of arsenic species, we focused on the egf receptor (egfr) signalling pathway. we demonstrate that both arsenite and arsenate treatment results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the egfr. this event is associated with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the shc adapter protein, leading to increased interaction with grb2. the arsenic‐induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was drastically reduced by treatment with either the egfr‐selective inhibitor tyrphostin ag1478 or anti‐egfr blocking antibody, suggesting that egfr is required for the subsequent activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. these results indicate that both arsenite and arsenate stimulate the egfr signalling pathway to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2.
          
 
 
  methods 
 
 
  cell culture and treatments 
 cryopreserved, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (nhek) from breast skin of adult females were purchased from kurabo (osaka, japan). nhek were grown at 37 °c, 5% co 2  in keratinocyte basal medium,  xxxd2215xxx ‐kb2 (kurabo), supplemented with 10 mug ml −1  insulin, 0·1 ng ml −1  recombinant egf, 0·5 mug ml −1  hydrocortisone, 0·4% bovine pituitary extract (bpe), 50 mug ml −1  gentamicin and 50 ng ml −1  amphotericin‐b (henceforth referred to as keratinocyte growth medium or  xxxd2215xxx  kg2; kurabo). nhek in passages 2–3 were subcultured at seeding densities of 2500 cells cm −2  in  xxxd2215xxx  kg2. when the cells were 55–65% confluent in passage 3, the medium was changed to  xxxd2215xxx  kg2 without hydrocortisone and bpe. the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 24 h and the medium was changed to fresh  xxxd2215xxx  kg2 without hydrocortisone and bpe. after 20 min, sodium arsenite (sigma, st louis, mo, u.s.a.) or sodium arsenate (wako, osaka, japan) was added directly into the medium to a final concentration of 100 mumol l −1  (arsenite) or 800 mumol l −1  (arsenate). the cultures were allowed to incubate for an additional 10 min to 2 h.  xxxd1169xxx  (30 mumol l −1 ) or  xxxd3177xxx  (5 mumol l −1 ) (calbiochem, san diego, ca, u.s.a.) was added to the medium 20 min prior to arsenic treatment.  xxxd3266xxx  (300 mumol l −1 ) or tyrphostin ag1478 (40 nmol l −1 ) (calbiochem) was added to the medium immediately before the addition of arsenic. inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) so that the final concentration of dmso in the culture medium never exceeded 0·05%, v/v. control groups were treated with 0·05% v/v dmso only. anti‐egfr monoclonal antibody (mab) (ab‐3, calbiochem) was added at 1 mug ml −1  media ( xxxd2215xxx  kg2 without hydrocortisone, bpe and egf) 20 min before arsenic treatment. all reagents were left in the medium until cells were harvested.
          
 
 
  preparation of cell extracts 
 nhek were washed twice in ice‐cold phosphate‐buffered saline and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mmol l −1  hepes (ph 7·4), 50 mmol l −1 beta‐glycerophosphate, 1% triton x‐100, 10% glycerol, 2 mmol l −1  egta, 1 mmol l −1  dithiothreitol, 10 mmol l −1  sodium fluoride, 1 mmol l −1  sodium orthovanadate, 2 mumol l −1  leupeptin, 1 mug ml −1  aprotinin, 2 mumol l −1  pepstatin a and 1 mmol l −1  phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. the soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15 000  g  for 10 min at 4 °c. protein concentrations were estimated with dc protein assay (bio‐rad laboratories, hercules, ca, u.s.a.) for normalization of protein content.
          
 
 
  immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis 
 for immunoprecipitation, soluble cell lysates normalized for total protein content were precleaned by incubation with 35 mul of protein a/g agarose (santa cruz biotechnology, inc, ca, u.s.a.) at 4 °c for 1 h. the supernatant was collected by centrifugation and incubated with 2 mug of an egfr mab clone b4g7 (takara, shiga, japan) or an shc polyclonal antibody (bd transduction laboratories, nj, u.s.a.) for 12–16 h at 4 °c with gentle rotation. the resultant immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein a/g agarose for 2 h at 4 °c. the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. 
 for protein detection in western blots, the whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer and heated to 100 °c for 3 min. whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed in a 7·5% or 10%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds)–polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membranes (atto, tokyo, japan) in 100 mmol l −1  tris and 194 mmol l −1  glycine using standard semidry electroblotting techniques. after transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk or 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in tris‐buffered saline (20 mmol l −1  tris–hcl, ph 7·6, and 137 mmol l −1  nacl containing 0·1% tween 20). the membrane was then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody: antiphospho‐specific  xxxg1369xxx /2 (thr202/tyr204), antiphospho‐specific jnk (thr183/tyr185), antiphospho‐specific p38 (thr180/tyr182), antiphospho‐specific  xxxg1361xxx /2 (ser217/221), all from new england biolabs (beverly, ma, u.s.a.), antiphospho‐egfr (tyr1173) (clone 9h2; upstate biotech. inc., lake placid, ny, u.s.a.), anti‐grb2 (santa cruz biotechnology inc.), or antiphosphotyrosine (clone py20)‐horseradish peroxidase conjugate (amersham biosciences; piscataway, nj, u.s.a.).
          
 detection of the immunoreactive bands was carried out using secondary antibody (a horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin or antimouse igg) and the ecl western blotting detection system (amersham pharmacia biotech). the data are representative of results observed in either two or three independent experiments.

  arsenite and arsenate activate  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38 
 during the treatment with either 100 mumol l −1  arsenite or 800 mumol l −1  arsenate (2 h), no significant alteration of nhek cell viability was observed as assessed by the wst assay (dojindo, kumamoto, japan), which measures reduction of formazan dye by dehydrogenases in living cells.
          
 western blot analysis of phosphorylated mapk proteins shows the time course of mapk ( xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38) activation in nhek treated with arsenite or arsenate ( fig. 1 ). we found that both arsenite and arsenate could induce activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38. however, the activation pattern of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by arsenic treatment was different from those of jnk and p38. the  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation occurred rapidly after arsenic treatment, reaching maximal activation after 30–45 min (arsenite) or 45–60 min (arsenate) ,  followed by a progressive decline ( fig. 1 ). in contrast, activation of jnk and p38 occurred later than the  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. marked activation of jnk was observed after 60 min (arsenite treatment) or 90 min (arsenate treatment), and p38 activation was observed after 45 min (arsenite treatment) or 90 min (arsenate treatment). the total amount of mapks was not altered by arsenic treatment during the time studied (data not shown). in the middle panels of  figure 1 , antiphospho‐jnk antibody detected bands of lower apparent molecular weight than that of pjnk46 at 30 and 45 min after arsenite treatment and at 45 and 90 min after arsenate treatment. these bands were very consistent with the  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation when we used the antiphosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody. this may be due to cross‐reaction of antiphospho‐jnk antibody with phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2.

 arsenite and arsenate activate mapks in nhek. nhek were treated with 100 mumol l −1  arsenite or 800 mumol l −1  arsenate for the indicated times. cell extracts were then subjected to sds–page followed by western blotting using phospho‐specific antibodies to  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk or p38. bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. 
 
 
 
 
 in the time–response and concentration–response studies, mapk activation was observed at a minimum concentration of 25 mumol l −1  (arsenite) and 400 mumol l −1  (arsenate) with different time kinetics depending on their concentrations (data not shown). arsenic‐induced activation of jnk and p38 occurred more rapidly and had a long‐lasting effect with each incremental increase in arsenic concentration. conversely, arsenite‐induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was more rapid, but became progressively more transitory with each increase in arsenite concentration (50 mumol l −1  arsenite; peak activation occurring at 60 min, 200 mumol l −1  arsenite; peak activation occurring at 20 min) (data not shown).
          
 
 
  arsenite and arsenate activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 through a signalling pathway mediated by  xxxg1361xxx /2 
 the level of mapk phosphorylation in cells is determined by two processes: phosphorylation by upstream kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatase(s). for mapk to be fully active, certain threonine and tyrosine residues on mapk must be phosphorylated by their respective mapk kinases (mapkk).  xxxg1369xxx /2 are selectively phosphorylated and activated by  xxxg1361xxx /2 (mapk or erk kinases). to analyse the molecular mechanism that leads to the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by arsenic treatment, the effect of arsenic on  xxxg1361xxx /2, upstream kinases of  xxxg1369xxx /2, was examined. both arsenite and arsenate activated  xxxg1361xxx /2 with similar time kinetics to that of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenic ( fig. 2 ). it has been reported that arsenite activated jnk through inhibition of a jnk phosphatase rather than through activation of upstream kinases. 11 ,  14  in an effort to determine whether upstream mediators are involved in  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenic, the effect of the  xxxg1361xxx /2‐specific inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  15  on arsenic‐induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was investigated. pretreatment of nhek with  xxxd1169xxx  resulted in complete inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation caused by arsenite or arsenate ( fig. 2 ). cross‐talk between  xxxg1369xxx /2 and stress‐activated p38 and jnk has been reported. for example, studies by ludwig  et al . 16  have provided evidence that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenite is highly dependent on the mkk6/p38 pathway. to examine whether p38 plays a role in  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenite and arsenate, nhek were exposed to arsenic in the presence of a p38 inhibitor,  xxxd3177xxx . 17 figure 2  shows that  xxxd3177xxx  did not influence  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenic. the solvent control (0·05% v/v dmso) had no effect on  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation during the time course of the experiment. the results indicate that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenic may require the activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2, but not p38 in nhek.

 to investigate the role of egfr as part of the upstream signalling event during  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, in response to arsenite and arsenate, the state of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation was determined. egfr was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using mouse anti‐egfr antibody. the immunoprecipitates were separated by sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) and tyrosine‐phosphorylated egfr was detected by western blot analysis using the mouse monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody py20 ( fig. 3a ). both arsenite and arsenate treatment led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr.

 arsenite and arsenate stimulate egfr tyrosine phosphorylation in nhek. nhek were treated with either 100 mumol l −1  arsenite or 800 mumol l −1  arsenate for indicated times. (a) cellular extracts from cells treated with arsenite and arsenate were immunoprecipitated (ip) with anti‐egfr monoclonal antibody and protein a/g agarose beads. egfr immunoprecipitates were then subjected to sds–page followed by western blotting using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody (clone py20). (b) lysates from cells treated with arsenite and arsenate were analysed by western blotting using the antiphosphotyrosine (tyr1173) egfr antibody (clone 9h2). 
 
 
 
 
 to determine if arsenic‐induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the egfr occurs at a major autophosphorylation site (tyr1173), 18  an antibody specific for the detection of this  xxxd1075xxx  was used to perform western blot experiments on lysates of the cells exposed to arsenic. as shown in  figure 3b , arsenite and arsenate stimulated the phosphorylation of egfr on tyrosine residue at position 1173.
          
 
 
  arsenite and arsenate induce tyrosine phosphorylation of shc and enhance its association with grb2 
 the adapter protein shc associates with  xxxd1075xxx  residues at positions 1128 and 1173 of the egfr 19 ,  20  and is itself phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation of the egfr. 21 ,  22  these shc  xxxd1075xxx  residues create binding sites for the sh2 (src homology 2) domain of the adapter protein, grb2. 22 ,  23  as shown in  figure 3b , we found increased levels of egfr  xxxd1075xxx  1173, a site recognized by the shc  xxxd1075xxx  binding domain, 18  in response to both arsenite and arsenate. to determine if shc has a similar function in the case of arsenite and arsenate treatment as it does during mitogen signalling, we examined whether shc was indeed tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with grb2 following treatment with arsenic. shc was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates by using rabbit anti‐shc antibody that recognizes three shc isoforms (46, 52 and 66 kda). the immunoprecipitates were then separated by sds–page, and tyrosine‐phosphorylated proteins in the immune complexes were detected by western blot analysis using the mouse monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody py20. as shown in  figure 4 , treatment of nhek with arsenite or arsenate led to an enrichment in tyrosine‐phosphorylated shc proteins. interestingly, a 170‐kda tyrosine‐phosphorylated protein (p170) was also detected in the shc immune complexes and it increased markedly over time. western blot analysis of the anti‐shc immunoprecipitates isolated from the arsenic‐treated cells with an anti‐egfr and antiphospho‐egfr (tyr1173) antibody indicated that p170 may be egfr (data not shown). these results suggested that treatment with arsenite or arsenate led to an interaction between the tyrosine‐phosphorylated protein p170, which may be egfr, and shc. western blot analysis of the anti‐shc immunoprecipitates with an anti‐grb2 antibody indicated that grb2 coimmunoprecipitated with shc. moreover, the amount of grb2 in the shc immunocomplexes increased markedly over time, and the enrichment of grb2 correlated with the kinetics of shc tyrosine phosphorylation ( fig. 5 ).

  activation of  xxxg681xxx  receptor is required for  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation caused by arsenite or arsenate 
 to examine the role of the egfr in the response to arsenite and arsenate, the effect of egfr inhibitors on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was examined. for this purpose, three inhibitory agents were used:  xxxd3266xxx , a general growth factor receptor inhibitor; 24  tyrphostin ag1478, a selective inhibitor of egfr; 25  and anti‐egfr antagonistic mab (ab‐3), which inhibits ligand binding and acts as an antagonist of egf‐stimulated  xxxg2198xxx  activity. 26 ,  27  treatment of nhek with  xxxd3266xxx  or tyrphostin ag1478 reduced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation caused by arsenite and arsenate ( fig. 6a ). no alteration in  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation was observed after treatment with 0·05% v/v dmso (solvent control) during the time course of the experiment. anti‐egfr antagonistic antibody treatment resulted in inhibition of arsenite‐ or arsenate‐triggered  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation ( fig. 6b ). in contrast to the inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, neither jnk nor p38 activation by arsenic was significantly affected by  xxxd3266xxx , tyrphostin ag1478 or anti‐egfr antagonistic antibody (data not shown). these results suggest that the activation of egfr by arsenite and arsenate is critical for downstream  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation.

  discussion 
 in the present study we initially examined the ability of arsenite and arsenate to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38 in nhek. it has been well established that arsenite activates  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and p38; 7 ,  11 , 28  however, there is only limited evidence that arsenate is capable of activating jnk. 12  evidence that human exposure to arsenate frequently occurs by way of contaminated water supplies 8  prompted us to examine the effects of arsenate on mapk activation. for this study we used primary cultures of normal cells, nhek, which are more representative of normal cellular signal transduction than transformed cell lines. our results show for the first time that arsenate, like arsenite, potently activates not only jnk but  xxxg1369xxx /2 and p38 in nhek. ludwig  et al . 16  reported that activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 occurred later than p38 activation in various human cell lines and that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenite was highly dependent on the mkk6/p38 pathway. however, in the present study using nhek, both arsenite and arsenate activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 prior to p38 activation and activated  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 with similar time kinetics. moreover, arsenic‐induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was suppressed by the  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx  but not by the p38 inhibitor,  xxxd3177xxx . these results suggest that both arsenite and arsenate activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 via a  xxxg1361xxx /2‐dependent and mkk6/p38‐independent pathway. the disagreement between these observations and those of ludwig  et al . may reflect differences in the egfr content of the cell lines used in each study.
          
 a number of previous studies have demonstrated activation of mapks in several cell types using relatively high concentrations of arsenite in the range of 50–500 mumol l −1 , 11 ,  12 , 16 ,  29 , 30  except in urotsa cells where 5 mumol l −1  of arsenite induced  xxxg1369xxx  phosphorylation. 31  it has been reported that arsenite induced cytotoxicity after a short exposure at an lc 50  (the median lethal concentration) of approximately 10–15 mumol l −1  in nhek. 32  hamadeh  et al . 33  reported that short‐term exposure to arsenite at 0·05–5 mumol l −1  elevated the cellular proliferation in nhek as measured by an increase in cellular mitosis and [ 3 h]thymidine incorporation. therefore, a concentration‐dependent study of mapk activation by arsenic was performed. however, mapk activation in response to a low concentration (0·05–5 mumol l −1 ) of arsenite, which has been reported to induce cell proliferation, could not be detected in our experimental systems.
          
 in general, the  xxxg1369xxx /2 cascade is activated by mitogens such as growth factors. 6  disruption in the regulation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway can predispose cells to undergo tumorigenic conversion as illustrated by the ras oncogene, 34  which lies upstream of  xxxg1369xxx /2. in addition, transfection studies show that constitutively active mutants of mek can lead to  in vitro  transformation, altered responses to growth factors, and tumour formation  in vivo . 35 ,  36  studies have shown an increase in the level and kinase activity of erks in human renal cell carcinoma 37  and breast cancer, 38  suggesting that overstimulation of this pathway may play a role in tumorigenesis. in keratinocytes, mapk inhibits 1,25‐ xxxd408xxx  ‐dependent signal transduction by phosphorylating human  xxxg1998xxx  (hrxralpha), a member of the nuclear receptor family which regulates transcription through its association with several heterodimeric partners, including the  xxxd1682xxx   receptor. 39  1,25‐ xxxd408xxx  , the active metabolite of  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx , is a potent inhibitor of growth of keratinocytes and stimulates their differentiation. 40  consequently, mapk activation may disrupt signal transduction regulating cell growth and differentiation by phosphorylation of hrxralpha, and lead to malignant transformation. furthermore, huang  et al . 7  reported that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation induced by arsenite may be required for cell transformation in cl 41 cells, a well‐characterized mouse epidermal cell model for tumour promotion. elucidation of the mechanism by which arsenic activates  xxxg1369xxx /2 may help clarify its carcinogenic properties. to that end, we focused on the egfr as an indicator of early events in the signalling pathway leading to  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation.
          
 the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is typically activated at the level of cell surface receptors by mitogens such as egf, and the shc–grb2–sos (son of sevenless)–ras–mapk cascade. this has been proposed to be the major mitogenic signalling pathway initiated by the egfr family of kinases. 41  the human egfr is an 1186‐amino acid residue protein (molecular weight 170 kda) that consists of an extracellular ligand‐binding domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  domain, and a cooh‐terminal region that contains three major autophosphorylation sites (tyr1068, tyr1148 and tyr1173), and two minor sites (tyr992 and tyr1086). 18 ,  42 - 44  the binding of ligands to egfr triggers the activation of its tyrosine kinases, resulting in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. 45 - 47  these residues then serve as docking sites for the recruitment of downstream signalling mediators necessary for the activation of membrane‐localized ras. 47  ras activation initiates the phosphorylation cascade starting with the activation of the proto‐oncoprotein raf, a serine kinase that phosphorylates and activates  xxxg1361xxx /2, which in turn activates  xxxg1369xxx /2. 46  the data presented in  figures 3–5  show that treatment with arsenite or arsenate results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the egfr and effective activation of the egfr signalling pathway, as assessed by the association of shc–grb2 with tyrosine‐phosphorylated egfr. we also observed that the egfr‐mediating pathway was required to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 but not jnk and p38 in nhek treated with arsenite or arsenate ( fig. 6 ). egfr activation has been shown to contribute not only to proliferation and migration of epithelial cells but also to regulation of cellular defence mechanisms important for cell survival (e.g. protection from apoptosis). 48 ,  49  such promotion of inappropriate survival by protecting cells against apoptosis may play a potential role in the carcinogenesis induced by arsenicals. the finding that 100 mumol l −1  arsenite or 800 mumol l −1  arsenate induced a similar magnitude of egfr stimulation leading to  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation is consistent with previous reports that arsenate is less toxic than arsenite in terms of cell survival and genotoxicity. 50  this discrepancy has usually been explained by less effective absorption of arsenate than arsenite. 50 
 stimulation of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation by agents other than egf family member ligands has been reported previously. 29 ,  51 - 56  we show that arsenite exposure can activate egfr in nhek, a result that is consistent with previous observations in pc12 cells 29  and human bronchial epithelial cells. 53  we also demonstrate for the first time that arsenate, like arsenite, is capable of stimulating the egfr signalling pathway leading to activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. the exact mechanism by which each arsenical stimulates egfr tyrosine phosphorylation is unclear; however, several possible hypotheses may be considered. arsenic may inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptpases), which in turn may enhance egfr phosphorylation. ptpases dephosphorylate receptor autophosphorylation sites and other proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine. ptpases function as an important regulatory mechanism for receptor  xxxg2198xxx  activity and signalling. kachinskas  et al . 10  have reported that arsenate leads to the accumulation of protein tyrosine phosphate, suggesting that arsenate may act as an inhibitor of ptpases. ptpases are sh enzymes and are therefore sensitive to thiol reagents. 57  arsenite has a high affinity for sh groups and reacts most readily with vicinal thiols and to a lesser degree with thiols proximal to hydroxyl ‐ bearing residues. 58  it is conceivable that arsenite directly interacts with the cysteine at the catalytic site of ptpases to inhibit their activity.
          
 it has also been reported that uv radiation and h 2 o 2  inhibit ptpases via generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn may enhance egfr phosphorylation. 56 ,  59  oxidative stress has been implicated in mediating many of the effects of arsenite 60  and arsenate. 61  it has been shown that arsenite generates intracellular oxidative metabolites, such as h 2 o 2 . 62 ,  63  therefore, arsenic may inactivate ptpases through reactive intermediates by a mechanism similar to that of uv radiation. 59  studies by suc  et al . 55  using immunopurified egfr, suggested that lipid peroxidation products were able to react directly with egfr, resulting in autophosphorylation and activation of the receptor. therefore, it is also possible that lipid peroxidation products generated by arsenic can directly activate egfr without the involvement of ptpases.
          
 we did not observe arsenic‐induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 when nhek were simultaneously treated with anti‐egfr antagonistic mab, which inhibits ligand binding to the receptor. therefore, it is possible that arsenic can actually mimic the action of ligands to activate the receptor  xxxg2198xxx . egfr contains extracellular cysteine‐rich domains that are important for ligand‐triggered dimerization. 45  for example, the sulfhydryl‐reactive arsenite could alter the conformation of egfr, resulting in an increase of its intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  activity by reacting with vicinal dithiols of egfr.
          
 arsenite, a well‐recognized sulfhydryl agent, exerts its toxic effects by reacting with thiols in cells, while arsenate, structurally similar to phosphate, can substitute for phosphate in a number of biochemical reactions. therefore, it might be supposed that arsenite and arsenate stimulate egfr by different mechanisms. however, in the present study, trivalent and pentavalent forms of arsenic exert similar effects in the activation of egfr. partial reduction from arsenate to arsenite can occur in the liver 64  and in cultured cells. 50  therefore, when nhek are exposed to pentavalent arsenate, it is possible that arsenite may be generated as well.
          
 in summary, the results of this study indicate that both arsenite and arsenate stimulate the egfr signalling pathway to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2. activation of the egfr/ xxxg1369xxx /2 cascade by arsenic may elicit its effect by disturbing the signal transduction pathway regulating cell growth and differentiation.
