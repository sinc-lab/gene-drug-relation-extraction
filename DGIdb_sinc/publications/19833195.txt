screening for endocrine active compounds

a b s t r a c t
despite more than a decade of research in the ﬁeld of endocrine active compounds with afﬁnity for the
 xxxg183xxx  (ar), still no validated recombinant ar binding assay is available, although recombinant ar can be obtained from several sources. with funding from the european union (eu)-sponsored
6th framework project, reprotect, we developed a model protocol for such an assay based on a simple ar
binding assay recently developed at our institution. important features of the protocol were the use of a rat
recombinant fusion protein to thioredoxin containing both the hinge region and ligand binding domain
(lbd) of the rat ar (which is identical to the human ar-lbd) and performance in a 96-well plate format.
besides two reference compounds [dihydrotestosterone (dht), androstenedione] ten test compounds
with different afﬁnities for the ar [levonorgestrel, progesterone, prochloraz, 17␣-methyltestosterone,
ﬂutamide, norethynodrel, o,p -ddt, dibutylphthalate, vinclozolin, linuron] were used to explore the performance of the assay. at least three independent experiments per compound were performed. the ar
binding properties of reference and test compounds were well detected, in terms of the relative ranking
of binding afﬁnities, there was good agreement with published data obtained from experiments using
recombinant ar preparations. irrespective of the chemical nature of the compound, individual ic50 -values
for a given compound varied by not more than a factor of 2.6. our data demonstrate that the assay reliably
ranked compounds with strong, weak, and no/marginal afﬁnity for the ar with high accuracy. it avoids
the manipulation and use of animals, as a recombinant protein is used and thus contributes to the 3r
concept. on the whole, this assay is a promising candidate for further validation.

1. introduction
concerns have been raised whether natural and man-made
chemicals might have the potential of interfering with the
endocrine system and thus may affect wildlife and humans and/or
their progeny. initial studies focused on interactions with  xxxg730xxx -mediated signaling, more recently, interactions with
other receptors such as the  xxxg183xxx  (ar) gained attention [1–5]. both the recommendations to the us environmental
protection agency (epa) of their endocrine disruptor screening
and testing advisory committee (edstac) [6] and the oecd conceptual framework for the testing and assessment of endocrine
disrupting chemicals [7] addressed receptor binding assays as
important tools to study interactions with sex hormone recep-

clinical and experimental pharmacology and toxicology in 2009.

tors and these assays represent important components of the
us epa tier 1 screening battery and of level 2 of the conceptual frame work. interestingly, despite more than one decade of
research in the ﬁeld of endocrine active compounds targeting the
ar, and the availability of recombinant ar from several sources,
still no validated  xxxg183xxx  binding assay using a recombinant ar protein and thus avoiding the use of animal tissues
as a receptor source is available. with funding from the eu 6th
framework project reprotect, we made ﬁrst steps towards such
a validation. a simple ar binding assay developed at our institution [8] using a rat recombinant fusion protein to thioredoxin
containing both the hinge region and ligand binding domain (lbd)
of the rat ar (which is identical to the human ar-lbd), performed in a 96-well plate format, was optimised and performance
of the assay protocol was evaluated. at least three independent
experiments per compound were performed on different days,
and dilutions of test compounds from deep-frozen stocks, solutions of radiolabeled ligand and receptor preparation were freshly
prepared for each experiment. besides the two reference compounds dihydrotestosterone (dht) and androstenedione, ten test
compounds (17␣-methyltestosterone (17␣-mt), levonorgestrel,

uron, vinclozoin, dibutylphthalate) with different afﬁnities for the
ar selected and agreed upon in collaboration with the european
centre for the validation of alternative methods (ecvam) were
studied, and results were subjected to an independent stringent
statistical analysis. the outcome of this investigation is reported
herein.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and receptor
dihydrotestosterone (≥99.5%), androstenedione (99%), levonorgestrel (99%),
progesterone (99%), norethynodrel (>99%), ﬂutamide (99%), dl-dithiothreitol (dtt,
>99%), human ␥-globulin (99%) and dextran-coated charcoal, were supplied by
sigma (taufkirchen, germany). 17␣-methyltestosterone (97–103%) was delivered
by acros organics (geel, belgium). prochloraz (99.5%), linuron (99.7%), and vinclozolin (99.6%) from riedel-de-haen and o,p -ddt (96.7%) from supelco were
obtained through sigma. dibutylphthalate (100%), dmso (p.a.), ethanol (p.a.), anhydrous glycerol,  xxxd3213xxx , and trishydroxyaminomethan were purchased
from e. merck (darmstadt, germany). ultima flo aptm and ultima gold scintillation
cocktails were products of canberra-packard (frankfurt, germany). [17␣-methyl3
h]-methyltrienolone ( xxxd2631xxx ,  xxxd2631xxx ) in ethanol with a speciﬁc activity of
2.579 tbq/mmol and a radiochemical purity of >97% was supplied by perkinelmer
(rodgau-jürgesheim, germany).  xxxg183xxx  (rat recombinant fusion protein to thioredoxin containing both the hinge region and ligand binding domain
of the rat ar, the ligand binding domain being identical to that of the human ar,
functional receptor concentration 3500 pmol/ml, speciﬁc activity 3933 pmol/mg)
was obtained from panvera (madison, wi, usa) through mobitec (göttingen, germany). the receptor preparation was slowly thawed on ice, aliquots were placed in
microvials, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept deep-frozen at −80 ◦ c. aliquots
were thawed only once.
2.2. determination of receptor binding
the assay was performed as described [8] with slight modiﬁcations. receptor
binding experiments were performed on 96-well microtiter plates generally in triplicate incubations. for total binding (= solvent control) and non-speciﬁc binding
(binding in the presence of excess, i.e., 1 ␮m dht) six replicates were performed.
if an experiment had to be spread across several microtiter plates, on each plate
total and non-speciﬁc binding was assessed. assay buffer (800 mmol nacl, 2 mmol
dtt, 10 g ␥-globulin and 100 ml glycerol made up to 1 l with 50 mm tris–hcl ph
7.5) was freshly prepared for each experiment. stock solutions of reference and
test compounds corresponding to 100-fold the highest concentration tested were
preferably prepared in ethanol, if ethanol was not suitable, dmso was used. aliquots
of stock solutions were kept deep-frozen, each aliquot was used only once and discarded at the end of an individual experiment. serial dilutions of stocks in solvent
were made, the ﬁnal step was 1:50 dilution into assay buffer. radiolabeled ligand
solution (8 nm 3 h- xxxd2631xxx ) was prepared in assay buffer containing 4% ethanol. the
actual amount of ligand was determined by liquid scintillation counting (lsc) in a

␤-counter (1900 tr counter, canberra-packard, frankfurt, germany) with quench
correction, the maximally tolerated deviation from the theoretical amount was ±5%.
if the tolerance was exceeded, depending on the deviation, small volumes of buffer
or radiolabeled ligand were added to meet the limits. ar was dissolved in assay
buffer to achieve a nominal concentration of 8 nm. to study receptor binding, assay
buffer (100 ␮l) containing test compound, excess dht to assess non-speciﬁc binding or solvent (2%) only, was mixed with 50 ␮l 3 h- xxxd2631xxx  solution for 10–15 min
at 2–8 ◦ c. then, ar solution in assay buffer was added and the whole mixture was
incubated at 2–8 ◦ c overnight under slight continuous shaking. final concentration
were 2 nm ar and 2 nm 3 h- xxxd2631xxx , for reference and test compounds concentrations
were chosen to achieve as much as possible full concentration response curves or
testing was performed up to the limit of solubility. the following concentrations
were used:

the next day, 50 ␮l of a 5% dextran-coated charcoal suspension in assay buffer
was added. after mixing in the cold for 10 min, charcoal was sedimented by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min in a cooling centrifuge. then, 50 ␮l aliquots of the clear
supernatant containing the ar-ligand complex were placed in another 96-well plate
and mixed with 200 ␮l ultima flo aptm scintillation cocktail (canberra-packard,
frankfurt, germany) and radioactivity was determined by lsc using a lsc microplate
reader (1450 microbetatm trilux, wallac, freiburg, germany).
in the course of this investigation, run 7 (replaced by run 8) of the competitive
binding experiments was invalidated. inadvertantly, the shaker had been set at too
high speed, and following the overnight incubation, material from various wells had
spilled over the plates.
2.3. data handling
for competitive binding experiments, prior to ﬁtting a dose–response model
and estimation of ic50 -values mean non-speciﬁc binding was subtracted from the
response. after subtraction the response was divided by the mean of the solvent
control. the three-parametric log-logistic function
f (x) =

1
1 + exp(2 (log(x) − 3 ))

was ﬁtted to the transformed data using the drm function of r-package drc [9].
parameter  1 is the upper asymptote of the response range and corresponds to
what is called “top” in graphpad prism, parameter  2 is the slope parameter, and
parameter  3 corresponds to the log of the ic50 . note that there is no estimation

4

a. freyberger et al. / reproductive toxicology 30 (2010) 2–8

of the lower asymptote of the response range. the “bottom” was assumed to be
0 after correction for non-speciﬁc binding in case of full displacement of ligand
from the receptor. ic50 -values and conﬁdence intervals were calculated using the
ed function of package drc. this software program was also used to generate graphs
of competitive binding experiments.

3. results
3.1. general binding properties
general binding characteristics in the absence of competitor
are summarized in table 1. in the presence of optimal ligand concentrations (101.0 ± 2.5% of the nominal value, range 97.7–104.9%
across all experiments) total, non-speciﬁc and speciﬁc binding was
39.1 ± 10.0%, 2.2 ± 0.6%, and 36.9 ± 10.2% of the added radiolabel
across a total of 15 individually assessed microtiter plates and
were generally quite uniform across all experiments. typically,
non-speciﬁc binding represented not more than 6% of total binding,
only in experiment 4 a corresponding ratio of 15% was obtained as
a consequence of a lower total binding. irrespective of this variability, total binding almost completely represented speciﬁc binding to
the receptor.

receptor (nominally 2 nm) was incubated with 2 nm [3 h]- xxxd2631xxx  and increasing
concentrations of compounds as indicated. binding was corrected for non-speciﬁc

displacement curves are shown. for the sake of clarity, only means and curve ﬁts
are given.

3.2. competition experiments
when investigating the ar binding properties, not all test compound stock solutions could be prepared in ethanol, due to their
limited solubility in this solvent. these compounds (linuron and
vinclozolin) were dissolved in dmso. even more critical was the
ﬁnal dilution into the buffer system. although efforts were made
to avoid concentrations resulting in turbidity or precipitation, this
could not be achieved in all cases, however, such concentrations
were not used for further evaluation. linuron and vinclozolin could
be tested up to 100,000 nm (100 ␮m). whereas vinclozolin was
unable to meaningfully displace radiolabeled ligand from the ar,
linuron only showed very moderate afﬁnity for the ar. at the
highest concentration an ic50 -value could not be established experimentally, as displacement of radiolabeled ligand by linuron was
only 33–34% in three independent experiments and only a partial

displacement curve was observed. however, an ic50 -value could be
extrapolated. a compilation of representative displacement curves
for linuron, vinclozolin, and the reference compounds dht and
androstenedione tested under the same conditions is shown in
fig. 1, corresponding ic50 -values and relative binding afﬁnities are
given in tables 2 and 3.
for most other test compounds dissolved in ethanol complete
or sufﬁciently complete (i.e., with an experimental ic50 -value) displacement curves could be established. o,p -ddt could only be
studied up to 10,000 nm (10 ␮m) resulting in 37–43% displacement of labeled ligand. however, a partial displacement curve
was observed and an ic50 -value could be extrapolated. for dbp
only at the highest testable concentration (100,000 nm/100 ␮m)
weak variable displacement of radiolabeled ligand was observed
(28%, 30%, and 18%), and only an untypical partial displacement

curve with a ﬂat slope was observed at best. interestingly, for ﬂutamide only in two out of three experiments an ic50 -value with
corresponding displacement curve was observed. a compilation of
representative displacement curves is given shown in fig. 2a and b,
corresponding ic50 -values and relative binding afﬁnities are given

overall, the following rank order of afﬁnity for the ar could be
established:

> progesterone ≥ androstenedione > o, p -ddt
> prochloraz >  xxxd2143xxx  > linuron
dibutylphthalate was not included, as only one data point observed
at the highest concentration supported weak afﬁnity for the ar and
the slope of the partial displacement curve was untypically ﬂat.
vinclozolin turned out to be a non-binder.

the value of receptor binding assays both as a mechanistic tool
to characterize receptor mediated endocrine activity, but also as an
important screening assay for endocrine active compounds, is well
recognized. interestingly, despite more than a decade of research
in the ﬁeld of endocrine active compounds targeting the androgen
receptor, no validated recombinant ar binding assay is available.
the aim of this work was to evaluate an optimised protocol as a
ﬁrst step towards validation of a recombinant ar binding assay.
the protocol worked well, total, non-speciﬁc and speciﬁc
binding were generally uniform across experiments. non-speciﬁc
binding was very low, on the average total binding almost fully
(94%) represented speciﬁc binding. previously performed saturation experiments [8] demonstrated that at a ligand concentration
of 2 nm binding still was not saturated and indicate that on the one
hand competitors could readily displace [3 h]- xxxd2631xxx  from the ar,
and on the other hand the ligand concentration was sufﬁciently
high to provide a readily measurable signal.
when competitive binding was studied, irrespective of the
chemical nature of the compound and the solvent used, for a given
compound individual ic50 -values varied by not more than a factor of 2.6 from one another. variability of binding afﬁnities relative
to dht (rba) was even better and did not exceed a factor of 1.7.
mean coefﬁcients of variation (cvs) across all experiments were
21% for ic50 -values and 15% for relative binding afﬁnities. these
low values, especially in the light of the low number of independent experiments, indicate that the assay is capable to accurately
assess receptor afﬁnities with only small variability. even extrapolated ic50 -values and rbas derived thereof showed little variability.
the failure of one experiment to detect the ar binding properties cannot argue against the high quality of the assay: a closer
examination of the data indicates that albeit different concentrations were used the data points obtained for “ﬂutamide” ﬁt well to

a
no ic50 -value was calculated due to unclear dose response (displacement curve was generally comparable to corresponding experiments, but contained one aberrant
data point at a low concentration).
b
o,p -ddt was tested up to 10 ␮m. ic50 -values were obtained by extrapolation and slightly exceeded the highest test concentration. similarly, lower and/or higher
conﬁdence intervals exceeded the highest test concentration.
c
 xxxd2143xxx  was tested up to 100 ␮m. the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval slightly exceeded the highest test concentration.
d
dbp was tested up to 100 ␮m. extrapolated ic50 -values and limits of conﬁdence intervals considerably exceeded the highest test concentration.

that of dibutylphthalate (consistently not yielding an ic50 -value)
obtained in the same experiment (not shown) and thus strongly
suggest that erroneously the wrong compound was tested under
the label “ﬂutamide”.
following an iccvam/niceatm recommendation [10] ethanol
was used as solvent whenever possible. accordingly, only the reference compounds dht and androstenedione were tested using
both solvents. one could speculate that the use of dmso seemed
to result in slightly lower ic50 -values and correspondingly slightly
higher rbas for androstenedione and possibly in lower variability
of ic50 -values in general. however, in the light of the low number of
experiments with dmso and the small number of compounds studied, it is not possible to draw sound conclusions and to consider
one solvent more appropriate than the other. basically, both sol-

vents can be used with the assay, and these options can be helpful
to achieve optimal dissolution of test compounds.
optimal interaction of a ligand with its receptor requires that the
free ligand concentration is equal to the added concentration. however, assay miniaturization in order to allow intermediate or high
throughput, increases the risk of ligand depletion (where the actual
concentration is signiﬁcantly lower than the added ligand concentration), since receptor concentrations are rather high in these
assays in order to achieve adequate signal sizes [11]. in competition experiments, ligand depletion results in a shift of competition
curves/ic50 -values to the right, i.e., to higher concentrations [12].
with regard to the experiments reported herein, total binding in
vehicle controls (see table 1) corresponded to 39.1 ± 10.0%. thus,
in all experiments slight ligand depletion had occurred. modeling

of ligand depletion indicated that the impact on competition experiments of a depletion up to 38% was small and possibly even 58%
was acceptable for a screening approach [12]. for any of the experiments reported herein ligand depletion was within that range.

however, in order to avoid exaggerated ligand depletion, the protocol should be modiﬁed and an upper limit of 38% for total binding
in vehicle controls (relative to the added ligand) should be established. this could readily be achieved by a mild reduction of the

receptor concentration without relevantly increasing the relative
fraction of non-speciﬁc binding or signiﬁcantly decreasing the signal size.
an important step in the evaluation of an assay is the comparison of assay data with data from similar assays observed for
the same test compounds. in table 6, results from the investigation reported herein are compared to recombinant ar binding data
published by three different working groups. the work reported
herein is basically using published methodology [8], which, however, used dmso as solvent. fang et al. [13] also used panvera’s
ar and labeled  xxxd2631xxx  as ligand, however, a lower ligand concentration (0.5 nm) was employed in a classical receptor binding
experiment with comparably large incubation volumes and the
laborous hydroxylapatite method was used to separate the receptor ligand complex from unbound ligand. hartig et al. [14] used
a crude recombinant chimpanzee ar preparation at a concentration resulting in lower (approx. 10%) speciﬁc binding in relation
to the added radiolabeled ligand in solvent controls. otherwise
the methodology was similar to that described herein. irrespective
of the methodological differences, relative binding afﬁnities for a
variety of chemicals were very comparable. results for o,p -ddt,
linuron, dbp and vinclozolin may need some further comment.
whereas in our hands ic50 -values for o,p -ddt and linuron could
only be extrapolated, results for dbp were equivocal and no binding
afﬁnity for vinclozolin was observed, fang et al. reported ic50 values for all these compounds. it cannot be excluded that the 4-fold
lower ligand concentration resulted in a slightly higher sensitivity of their assay just allowing calculation of ic50 -values. on the
other hand, a more appropriate selection of the concentration range
may have favoured establishment of ic50 -values. vinclozolin predominantly acts through its metabolites generated metabolically
by hydrolysis, it has marginal/if any afﬁnity to the ar on its own.
whether hydrolysis of vinclozolin had occurred in the experimental
system used by fang et al. [13] was not reported and probably not
investigated. the absence of binding afﬁnity of vinclozolin and the
low afﬁnity observed for ﬂutamide indicate that our assay is devoid
of metabolic capacity to activate these compounds to efﬁciently
binding metabolites (ring-opening products of vinclozolin, hydroxyﬂutamide). furthermore, as any receptor binding assay, it is not
able to discriminate (partial) agonists and antagonists. remarkably,
rbas reported herein correlated very well with those published by
freyberger and ahr several years ago [8]. as these investigations –
except the solvent – used the same ﬁnal conditions this is excellent
proof of the stability and reliability of the assay over many years.
our data demonstrate that the assay reliably ranked structurally diverse compounds with strong, weak, and no/marginal
afﬁnity for the ar with high accuracy. using a rat recombinant
 xxxg183xxx  it avoids the manipulation and use of animals, i.e., the preparation of prostate cytosol from castrated rats,
and thus contributes to the 3r concept. in terms of the ecvam
modular approach of validation, the data set presented herein
corresponds to the ﬁrst two modules, namely test deﬁnition and

within-laboratory variability [15]. the assay may be used to screen
for endocrine-modulating compounds with afﬁnity for the ar, to
further investigate equivocal results from other in vitro assays such
as transactivation assays and it may also be used as a mechanistic tool in order to characterize effects on the endocrine system
observed in animal studies. whether ar binding studies can reliably predict the outcome of corresponding in vivo screening assays
such as the hershberger assay remains to be explored. on the
whole, this assay is a promising candidate for further validation.
