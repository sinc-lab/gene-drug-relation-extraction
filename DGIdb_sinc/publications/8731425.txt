abstract

chronic depolarization enhances survival of cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons by elevating the internal calcium concentration
([ca2+]j. in fura2-loaded cells maintained in 25 mm kcl, [ca2+]i was close to 150 nm and decreased to =50 nm when kc1 was lowered to 5.4 mm. the effect of  xxxd2728xxx  (ic50 = 0.45 nm) was similar to depolarization removal, while agatoxin iva (up to 500 nm)
was ineffective. in whole-cell-clamp experiments, the ic50 for current inhibition was 57 nm, while with transient, kcl-induced depolarizations, the dose dependence of  xxxd2728xxx  inhibition had a ‘double-affinity’ shape, with ic&l) = 0.30 nm and 1(&(2) = 71 nm.
we concluded that l-type calcium channels are the main responsible of the elevated internal calcium level necessary for survival in
these neurons. these channels do not inactivate and bind  xxxd2728xxx  with different affinity, depending on their state.

neuronal survival in vitro and in absence of specific
trophic factors is significantly
enhanced by membrane
depolarization in several neuronal models [4,5,9]. steadystate depolarizations,
achieved by elevating the external
potassium concentration,
[k+],, in the culture medium,
rescue cerebellar granule cells from programmed
cell
death or apoptosis [3,6]. this effect is thought to work by
mimicking survival-promoting
effects of naturally occurring electrical activity and to be mediated by the elevation
of the internal free calcium concentration,
[ca2+]i, resulting from the enhanced ca2+ influx through voltage-gated
channels. in fact, different agents that raise [ca2+]i, also
independent of direct depolarization, have been shown to
promote neuronal
survival,
including
thapsigargin
in
sympathetic
neurons [!j] and excitatory amino acid in
cerebellar granule cells [s]. the mechanisms underlying
these effects are still largely unknown.
we have investigated
the nature of the voltagedependent calcium channels responsible for the survivalpromoting increase in internal calcium in chronically depolarized cerebellar granule neurons maintained in short* corresponding author. tel.: +39 10 6475578; fax: +39 10 6475500;

term cultures. these neurons were prepared according to
a standard procedure [ 1,101 from g-day-old sprague
dawley rats (charles river italia). cultures were treated
with 10pm  xxxd1790xxx  from day 1 to minimize
proliferation
of non-neuronal
cells, and maintained
in
basal eagle’s culture medium, supplemented
with 10%
foetal calf serum, loopg/ml gentamicin and 25 mm kcl.
experiments were carried out in cultures between 5 and
13 days in vitro (div). in cultures maintained in basal
(5.4 mm) kc1 medium, additionally supplemented
with
glucose (5 g/l), transferrin (100 mg/l) and insulin (50 mg/
l), ~90% of the neurons were dead within 6 div.
[ca2+]i was measured by the ratiometric fluorescent
calcium chelator fura [7]. the experimental
procedure
has been described previously [lo]. the cultures were
incubated in 4 ,um fura2lam (boehringer, mannheim).
in some experiments, the potassium concentration
of the
incubation buffer was elevated to 25 mm by equimolar
substitution of sodium with potassium. cells were placed
on an inverted microscope
(zeiss im35, germany),
equipped with a 100x nikon fluor objective, and illuminated by a xenon lamp (fti, brunswick, nj) through appropriate interference filters. emitted light was collected
by a photomultiplier
(thornemi, ruislip, uk). optical

measurements
were carried out by a computer-driven
spectrophotometer
system
(cairn
research,
sittingbourne, uk), with a final time resolution of 0.5 s/point.
[ca*+]i was calculated according to grynkiewicz et al. [7],
assuming a dissociation constant of the dye kd = 140 nm
at room temperature. the calibration protocol by the 4bromo calcium ionophore a23187 was performed as in
our previous work [lo]. solutions were fed by gravity
continuously,
with the exception of toxins (o-agatoxin,
fraction iva, obtained either from peptides international,
louisville, ky, usa, or from latoxan, rosans, france,
and w-conotoxin, fraction gvia obtained from bachem,
bubendorf, switzerland), which were pipetted directly to
the recording chamber after perfusion was stopped. the
dihydropyridine
(dhp)  xxxd2728xxx , a specific l-type calcium channel antagonist, obtained from bayer s.p.a.,
milano, italy, was made up in 100% ethanol and then
diluted in the recording solution. ineffectiveness
of the
solvent alone was routinely tested.
when neurons were maintained in 5.4 mm kc1 both
during and after incubation with fura2, the basal calcium
level was 36 + 2 nm (mean f sem, ii = 95). a transient
(20-60 s) depolarization by 25 mm kc1 caused an elevation of the internal calcium level up to 211 + 11 nm
(n = 51) [lo]. when the loading procedure was carried
out in 25 mm kci, the internal calcium concentration was
155 + 9 nm (n = 13) and decreased to 43 f 6 nm (n = 9)
when the external kc1 was lowered to 5.4 mm (control
solution). the time course of this decrease could be approximated by a single exponential function with time
constant r = 20 s (20 + 1, n = 3). in the same neurons
(maintained
in 25 mm kcl), treatment with 1 pm  xxxd2728xxx  resulted also in a decrease of internal calcium to
virtually the same level as that attained with the control
solution (fig. 1a). also in this case, the time course of
the decrease could be approximated by a single exponential function with t = 20 s (21 + 2, iz= 3). this indicates
that the kinetics of  xxxd2728xxx  block cannot be derived
from these measurements
and suggests a complicate interplay of different mechanisms.
then, we tested the effect of agatoxin fraction iva
(agatx), a toxin known to block the p- and q-type calcium
channels [12,14,16]. as we reported previously
[lo],
agatx reduced the peak calcium value reached during superfusion with 75 mm kc1 by ~50%. in contrast, when
neurons were maintained in 25 mm kc1 during the whole
experiment, the treatment with an elevated dose of agatx
for 5 min was completely ineffective (fig. 1b). however,
when the external bath was replaced with a solution containing basal kcl, or elevated kc1 and 1 pm  xxxd2728xxx ,
the calcium level quickly decreased as expected. a similar result was obtained in other three experiments. the
toxin o-conotoxin
fraction gvia, a specific blocker of
n-type calcium channels, was equally ineffective on the
calcium rise caused by transient [lo] and steady-state
depolarizations (not shown).

fig. 1.effect of  xxxd2728xxx  on the steady-state internal calcium level in
chronically depolarized neurons. neurons were incubated with fura in
25 mm kci. only one out of five experimental points is shown for
clarity. (a) treatment with 1 ym  xxxd2728xxx  resulted in a decrease of
the intracellular calcium concentration to virtually the same level as
that attained with the control solution (5.4 mm kci). (b) a 5 min.
incubation with agatoxin iva was completely ineffective.

these results were compared to those obtained with
different approaches (fig. 2). membrane currents were
measured in whole-cell clamp configuration,
in 10 mm
barium, as in our previous studies [ 1, lo].  xxxd2728xxx  at
1 ,um blocks the maximum current at +lo mv from a
holding potential of -80 mv by approximately 25% (fig.
2a). the dose dependence was approximated by an occupancy model with a single binding site with it& = 57 nm
(fig. 2d, circles). the effect of different doses of  xxxd2728xxx  on the peak calcium rise induced by 25 mm
kc1 from a resting (5.4 mm external kcl) condition (fig.
2b) displays a dose dependence curve which extended
over five decades and could not be approximated by an
occupancy model with a single binding site. we used a
‘double-affinity’
model
with i&( 1) = 0.30 nm and
i&,(2) = 71 nm ([lo] and fig. 2d, squares). finally, the
steady-state internal calcium level in chronically depolarized neurons was very sensitive to  xxxd2728xxx  and a significant decrease could be resolved with doses as low as
100 pm. (fig. 2c) the dose dependence was approximated by an occupancy model with a single binding site
with i&, = 0.45 nm (fig. 2d, triangles).
comparison of the three dose dependence curves corroborates the interpretation of a dhp binding site, whose
affinity is dependent on the channel state [lo]. indeed, in
whole-cell clamp experiments, depolarizations
are necessarily very brief and therefore the drug binds to closed
channels, with a relatively low affinity. in transient,
[k+],-driven depolarizations
which lasted 30-60 s, the
drug binds to both closed and open channels and the dose
dependence curve shows a ‘double affinity’ shape. in
persistent depolarizations,
the calcium level appears to

result from a steady influx of calcium through noninactivated channels and  xxxd2728xxx  binds to open channels, with relatively high affinity. therefore, a four state
model (see fig. 2d, inset), originally proposed for gh3
cells [2], may provide a simple quantitative framework of
the dhp mode of action on these neurons. the transition
between c (closed) and 0 (open) state in the absence of
the drug is defined by the activation curve of the channel.
this is the only voltage-dependent
transition
in the
scheme. the transition from c to cd (corresponding
drug-bound state) is governed by the dissociation constant
for drug binding to the closed state, k,, which is in the 5070 nm range, while the transition from 0 to od is governed by the dissociation
constant k, = 0.345
nm. in
agreement with this model and as reported in other neurons [ 111, at high (2500 nm) concentration
of the drug,
the voltage-dependence
of the  xxxd2728xxx  block was obscured, because this dose is well above the k, range. an

inactivation state is not included in this model because
inactivation was found to be negligible for l-type calcium
channels [lo], as presently confirmed by the observation
that, during proionged depolarizations,
these channels
drive calcium into the cell constantly.
we concluded that, in rat+erebellar
granule neurons,
the calcium current which sustains the elevated level of
internal calcium during small and lqng depolarizations
is
almost entirely of the dhp-sensitive type. these l-type
calcium channels, when in the open state, bind  xxxd2728xxx  with high affinity. our results are in agreement with
previous observations
that during very long and weak
depolarizations,
a small, but non-inactivating
calcium
influx, due to l-type channels, rises [ 151 and may mediate ca-dependent functions [13]. in addition, our observations indicate that, in different circumstances,  xxxd2728xxx  may be capable of strongly antagonizing steady-state
calcium loads.
