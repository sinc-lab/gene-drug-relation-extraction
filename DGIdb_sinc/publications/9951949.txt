it is widely accepted that the most challenging goal in the management of
patients with diabetes mellitus is to achieve blood glucose levels as close to
normal as possible. in general, normalising postprandial blood glucose levels is
more difficult than normalising fasting hyperglycaemia. in addition, some
epidemiological studies suggest that postprandial hyperglycaemia (pphg) or
hyperinsulinaemia are independent risk factors for the development of macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus.
recently, several drugs with differing pharmacodynamic profiles have been
developed which target pphg. these include insulin lispro, amylin analogues,
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and meglitinide analogues.
insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of action and shorter duration of efficacy
compared with regular  xxxd2364xxx . in clinical trials, the use of insulin lispro
was associated with improved control of pphg and a reduced incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes.
 xxxd3098xxx , a meglitinide analogue, is a short-acting insulinotropic agent
which, when given before meals, stimulates endogenous insulin secretions and
lowers postprandial hyperglycaemic excursions.
both insulin lispro and  xxxd3098xxx  are associated with postprandial hyperinsulinaemia. in contrast, amylin analogues reduce pphg by slowing gastric
emptying and delivery of nutrients to the absorbing surface of the gut. alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors such as acarbose,  xxxd2644xxx  and  xxxd3524xxx  also reduce pphg primarily
by interfering with the carbohydrate-digesting enzymes and delaying glucose
absorption.
with the availability of agents which preferentially reduce postprandial blood
glucose excursions, it is now possible to achieve glycaemic goals in a larger
proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus.

over 60 years ago, dr. elliott p. joslin believed
that the goals of therapy for those with diabetes
mellitus should include a serious effort to achieve
blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.[1] the validity of this approach was subsequently confirmed by a number of interventional
studies. the most comprehensive of these studies
was the diabetes control and complications trial[2]
which demonstrated beyond doubt the benefits of
achieving near normal blood glucose levels in individuals with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes
mellitus. however, in clinical practice, normalising blood glucose levels is a formidable challenge.
even more difficult is the control of postprandial
surges of blood glucose levels. in 1 study, treatment

of a group of individuals with type 2 (non–insulindependent) diabetes mellitus with either diet, a sulphonylurea or insulin, lowered fasting blood glucose levels substantially while postprandial blood
glucose excursions continued to exceed 11.1 mmol/l
(200 mg/dl).[3]
the pathophysiology of postprandial hyperglycaemia (pphg) is illustrated in figure 1. the main
determinants of postprandial blood glucose levels
are the availability of insulin and the influx of glucose from the gut. however, disposition of glucose
at peripheral tissues as well as reduced downregulation of hepatic glucose output are also important contributors to pphg.

drug therapy of post-prandial hyperglycaemia

ulate postprandial blood glucose levels, any therapeutic intervention aimed at lowering the blood
glucose level in individuals with diabetes mellitus
will have some ameliorating effect on pphg, irrespective of its mechanism of action. more recently,
however, several classes of agents have been developed which primarily target pphg.
1. the rationale for treating
postprandial hyperglycaemia
there are multiple rationales to justify the treatment of pphg. perhaps the most compelling reason to target pphg is to achieve around-the-clock
blood glucose control. the relative contribution
of postprandial excursions of blood glucose to overall glycaemic control, as indexed by glycosylated
haemoglobin (hba 1c) levels, depends on the
magnitude of fasting hyperglycaemia. it is likely
that the higher the fasting blood glucose concentrations, the less the proportion of hba1c attributable to pphg.
in a recent study of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus it was found that post-lunch plasma
glucose levels at 2pm and 5pm were better predictors of glycaemic control and correlated better with
hba1c than fasting plasma glucose.[4] it is noteworthy that pphg, similar to hba 1c, has been
correlated with the presence of diabetic complications, notably retinopathy and nephropathy, in various epidemiological studies.[5-7] in addition, some
data, especially in pregnant women with diabetes
mellitus, indicate that normalising postprandial
blood glucose levels is associated with better outcomes of pregnancy than normalising pre-prandial
blood glucose levels.[8] such observations underscore the potential dire consequences of pphg.
another important reason for treating pphg is
the fact that pphg, even in the absence of marked
fasting hyperglycaemia, is a recognised risk factor
for coronary artery disease.[9-14] the honolulu
heart study evaluated the role of pphg in the risk
of fatal coronary heart disease (chd) and total
chd. this study found that the risk of chd increased significantly as 1-hour post-50gm glucose
load serum glucose values increased.[9] the age© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

21

adjusted rate for fatal chd in those with postprandial serum glucose values in the range of 8.7 to
10.5 mmol/l (157 to 189 mg/dl) was at least twice
the rate in those where postprandial values were
less than 6.3 mmol/l (114 mg/dl). in addition, the
rate of sudden death per 1000 men who had 1-hour
post-50gm glucose loads with serum glucose levels of <8.4 mmol/l (<151 mg/dl) was only 21; this
rate more than doubled in those with post-load serum glucose levels of between 8.4 to 12.4 mmol/l
(151 to 224 mg/dl).[10] this indicated that even mild
pphg increased the risk of chd significantly.
in a study of 18 403 british men aged 40 to 60
years (the whitehall study),[11] it was found that
chd mortality was doubled in individuals with
2-hour post-50g oral glucose load levels of 5.3 to
10.9 mmol/l (96 to 196 mg/dl) compared with
individuals with 2-hour post-glucose load levels
of <96mg/dl. similarly, in the islington diabetes
survey,[12] the prevalence of major chd increased
from 9% in patients with normal glucose tolerance
to 17% in those with impaired glucose tolerance,
defined as whole blood glucose levels of 6.7 to
10.0 mmol/l (120 to 180 mg/dl) 2 hours after a
glucose load of 50g. the prevalence of chd in
individuals with diabetes mellitus was only 20%,
a figure similar to the prevalence rate among those
with predominantly pphg. in addition, the bedford study[13] also found that the protection against
chd found in nondiabetic individuals was lost
with the onset of pphg.
in a recent study of individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus seen in 16 diabetes clinics (diabetes intervention study),[15] it was
found that pphg, but not fasting hyperglycaemia,
was an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and total mortality.
it is evident that the risk of chd is substantially
increased with the onset of pphg. it is not known
if this risk is attributable directly to hyperglycaemia or is secondary to other risk factors such as
associated postprandial hyperinsulinaemia. it is
likely that the clustering of metabolic cardiovascular risk factors is more important than hyperglycaemia, a single component of the insulin resistance

syndrome.[16] the paris prospective study[17] found
that postprandial hyperinsulinaemia, like fasting
hyperinsulinaemia, was a more sensitive predictor
of fatal coronary disease than either hyperglycaemia or diabetes.[17] similarly, in the helsinki
policemen study,[18] the association of fatal and
nonfatal chd with 1 and 2 hour postprandial
hyperinsulinaemia was stronger than the association with fasting hyperinsulinaemia.
the association between high but non-diabetic
blood glucose levels and the risk of death was recently evaluated by balkau et al.[19] men in the
upper 20% of the 2-hour glucose distributions had
a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality in
comparison with men in the lower 80%.[19] this
observation suggested that even a mild postprandial elevation of blood glucose levels was a risk
factor.
overall, there is strong evidence in the literature
to suggest that chd is associated either directly
with pphg independent of fasting serum glucose
levels or that the association is the result of hyperinsulinaemia as an index of insulin resistance. although direct experimental proof is still lacking, it
is reasonable to expect that targeting pphg with
the currently available therapeutic agents would
decrease the risk of chd. in this regard, it is noteworthy that in an atherosclerosis-prone animal
model, acarbose treatment was associated with reduced atherosclerotic lesions.[20] this could partially be attributed to a reduction in postprandial
hypertriglyceridaemia.[21]
the recent revision of the diagnostic criteria for
diabetes by the american diabetes association has
allowed for the early identification of larger numbers of individuals at risk for macrovascular disease who otherwise would have been left undiagnosed.[22] however, these criteria de-emphasise
any role of postprandial blood glucose testing in
screening for diabetes mellitus primarily because
of difficulties in the logistics of standardising such
tests. although at the present time there is no direct
evidence to indicate that treatment of pphg would
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the strong
epidemiological association between pphg and

coronary disease suggests that targeting pphg with
dietary or pharmacological means would be prudent clinical practice.
there are other theoretical reasons why pphg
may pose an added risk to the patient with diabetes
mellitus. one is that pphg in some individuals may
be associated with postprandial lipaemia.[21,23-25]
lipoprotein moieties with enhanced atherogenic
potential have been identified during postprandial
lipaemia. there is a correlation between postprandial triglyceride levels and carotid artery sclerosis.[26] in addition, postprandial triglyceride level,
like plasma cholesterol, is a predictor of chd.[27]
it is theoretically possible that reduction of postprandial lipaemia associated with the amelioration
of pphg would have favourable effects on the progression of chd.[15,17] however, such an association remains speculative at this time.
another theoretical concern linking diabetic complications to pphg is the enhanced lipid peroxidation associated with postprandial elevations of the
blood glucose level.[28-30] it is tempting to speculate that amelioration of pphg will result in a reduced post-meal oxidative load and perhaps decrease diabetic complications. more studies are
needed to determine if indeed therapeutic targeting of pphg results in a reduced rate of lipid peroxidation.
finally, the relationship between postprandial
hyperinsulinaemia and deterioration of cognitive
function in older individuals is intriguing.[31] however, at this time, there is no evidence to suggest
that amelioration of postprandial hyperinsulinaemia with pharmacological means would enhance
cognitive function.
2. management of postprandial
hyperglycaemia
both dietary and pharmacological tools are
now available for the management of pphg. the
pharmacological agents with the greatest effect on
pphg include insulin lispro, amylin analogues and
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. dietary modifications or
use of supplements such as guar gum are also helpful and will be discussed briefly.
drugs 1999 jan; 57 (1)

drug therapy of post-prandial hyperglycaemia

2.1 dietary modifications and
the use of supplements

several dietary modifications can be made which
would potentially reduce pphg. the main dietary
determinant of postprandial blood glucose levels
is the carbohydrate (cho) content.[32-35] in order
to avoid marked postprandial blood glucose excursions, multiple small portions of meals rather than
the traditional 2 or 3 large meals a day has long
been recommended as a prudent dietary habit. in
addition, the reduction in cho content of the diet
in some hypertriglyceridaemic individuals would
also be helpful. in these individuals, cho can be
substituted with monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx .[36]
the possible benefit of modest cho restriction
in the diet of those with gestational diabetes was
recently reported.[37] in addition to reducing the
cho content of the diet, the use of poorly digestible cho instead of refined, easily digestible cho
would also ameliorate pphg.[38,39] individualisation of diet based on an assessment of the glycaemic index of foods has been suggested. [38,39]
another approach has been diet supplementation with soluble fibre such as guar and oat gums
and some hemicelluloses. the effect of these
modifications on pphg is usually modest.[40]
if dietary modifications are not sufficient in
ameliorating pphg, then drug therapy is indicated.
2.2 pharmacological therapy
2.2.1 insulin lispro

the development of insulin lispro was in response to the realisation that new insulins were
needed to mimic the physiological insulin response
to meals. insulin lispro differs from  xxxd2364xxx 
only in the order of 2 amino acids in the beta-chain.
the proline and lysine at positions b28 and  xxxd1320xxx  of
 xxxd2364xxx , respectively, were inverted in the
insulin lispro compound. this inversion in amino
acid sequence allowed the hexamer-structure of
insulin lispro at the subcutaneous injection site to
dissociate to dimers and monomers at a faster rate,
and with less variability.[41,42] this accounts for the
faster onset of insulin activity. unlike  xxxd2364xxx , where increasing doses are associated with a

23

time shift in peak action, insulin lispro pharmacokinetics appear to be less variable with changes in
dose.[41] of note is that the serum concentrations
of insulin and glucose after the intravenous administration of  xxxd2364xxx  and insulin lispro are
identical, indicating that the insulin analogue and
 xxxd2364xxx  have equal bioavailability and potency when administered intravenously. in addition, the binding characteristics of these 2 insulins
to insulin receptors or insulin-like growth factor-1
receptors are identical.[41]
large clinical studies in patients with both type
1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have shown that the
primary efficacy parameter of insulin lispro is a
reduction in postprandial glucose excursions.[43-45]
however, the overall glycaemic control, as measured with hba1c, was not improved when patients were given insulin lispro instead of regular
 xxxd2364xxx . in general, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus randomised to receive insulin lispro
tended to have less hypoglycaemia, especially during the night.[43,44] this latter advantage was also
apparent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
who were usually less predisposed to having severe hypoglycaemic reactions.[45]
overall, it is evident that the main advantage of
insulin lispro is improved control of pphg with
the added advantage that it can be used within 10
to 20 minutes of initiation of food intake, allowing
more flexibility in insulin dose scheduling.
2.2.2 amylin analogues

amylin is a pancreatic beta-cell hormone cosecreted with insulin in response to various insulin secretagogues. since its discovery in 1987,
a host of studies have been performed in order to
determine the physiological role of amylin.[46-49]
the mechanisms of action include: (i) the regulation of gastric emptying, thereby limiting the rate
of delivery of nutrients to the absorptive surface
of the gut;[49-51] (ii) suppression of postprandial
glucagon secretion;[52] and (iii) replenishment of
hepatic glycogen stores.
in general, amylin secretion correlates with
insulin secretion in healthy individuals and in
those with type 1 diabetes mellitis where amylin
drugs 1999 jan; 57 (1)

24

mooradian & thurman

secretion, like insulin secretion, is profoundly impaired. in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
the decline in amylin secretory response correlates
with reduced pancreatic beta-cell activity. however,
it appears that decreased stimulated amylin release
precedes the impairment of insulin secretion and
that in some individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus there is a dissociation in the insulin and amylin secretory responses to sulphonylureas.[53,54] it
is tempting to speculate that the deterioration in
amylin secretory capacity in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus precedes the gradual loss of the
insulin secretory response.
another potential clinical condition associated
with the dissociation between amylin and insulin
production is physiological aging.[55] in one study
of pancreatic islet cells of aging rats, it was found
that, with age, there was a greater increment in
amylin mrna than insulin mrna. this suggested
that the proportions of insulin and amylin synthesised and secreted may change with age as appears
to occur in other insulin resistant states.[56,57]
 xxxd2994xxx 

the short half-life of amylin and its tendency
to self-aggregate limits its therapeutic usefulness.
these limitations have been surmounted with the
advent of  xxxd2994xxx . this is a human amylin
analogue in which the amino acid residues at positions 25, 28 and 29 have been replaced with proline. these substitutions prevent self-aggregation
of the molecule without diminishing its biological
activity. subcutaneous injections or intravenous
infusions of  xxxd2994xxx  reduced post-meal glucose
excursions significantly in healthy volunteers as
well as in individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes
mellitus.[58,59] the drug also did not alter the disposition of intravenously administered glucose.
these observations indicated that the main site of
action of  xxxd2994xxx  was in the gut, presumably
through reductions in the rate of gastric emptying
and amelioration of the mismatch between nutrient
delivery and insulin secretory response.
the clinical utility of  xxxd2994xxx  in the general
population of people with diabetes mellitus remains to be demonstrated. many patients with dia© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

betes have delayed gastric emptying in the absence
of clinical symptoms of gastroparesis[60] and in
many individuals with diabetes mellitus glucagon
secretion decreases over time and does not play a
significant role in the aggravation of hyperglycaemia.[61] these realities cast doubt on the suitability
of this agent for the majority of patients with diabetes mellitus.
however, recent reports from initial phase iii
trials have been encouraging. in a double-blind
study of 477 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
treated for 12 months with placebo or  xxxd2994xxx 
30mug or 60mug 4 times daily,[62] there was a significant net decrease in hba1c of 0.30% without an
increased frequency of hypoglycaemia or increasing bodyweight gain.
in another study of 539 individuals with type 2
diabetes mellitus, [63]  xxxd2994xxx  treatment was
associated with significant bodyweight reduction
from baseline and improvement in hba1c by
0.38% compared with the placebo-treated group.
ongoing studies will further clarify the therapeutic
role of  xxxd2994xxx  in the management of individuals with diabetes mellitus.
2.2.3 alpha-glucosidase inhibitors

at the present time, there are 3 glucosidase inhibitors that are available for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. these include
acarbose,  xxxd2644xxx  and  xxxd3524xxx .[64-78] the inhibitory activity of  xxxd3524xxx  on  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase
is 190 to 270 times greater than that of acarbose.
however,  xxxd3524xxx  has a much weaker inhibitory
effect on  xxxg158xxx  compared with acarbose. thus, at clinically useful doses,  xxxd3524xxx  is
a selective dissacharidase inhibitor.  xxxd2644xxx  also
lacks inhibitory activity on alpha-amylase.[64,65,73,77]
acarbose has been the most extensively studied
and widely used agent of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor class. although there are some differences in
the enzyme inhibitory profile of these agents, as a
class their main mechanism of action is through
inhibition of cho digestion. acarbose has a significant inhibitory effect on  xxxg1401xxx  (90%
inhibition), sucrase (65% inhibition) and  xxxg1401xxx 
(60% inhibition).[64] acarbose has produced 25 and
drugs 1999 jan; 57 (1)

drug therapy of post-prandial hyperglycaemia

10% inhibition of  xxxg2070xxx  and lactase activity,
respectively. thus, lactose intolerance has not occurred during acarbose treatment.[64,79]
glucosidase enzyme inhibition results in delayed cho digestion. this has resulted in delayed
glucose absorption with attenuation of postprandial hyperglycaemic excursions. it is noteworthy
that although cho absorption is delayed, the total
amount of cho absorbed is not altered and therefore there are no net nutritional caloric losses.[80]
in addition, absorption in the gut of minerals such
as copper or zinc have not been reduced when
acarbose has been administered with meals.[81]
acarbose treatment has been associated with increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide (glp-1).
when undigested chos reach the ileum, enteric
glucagon cleavage increases, resulting in an increase in glp-1 levels.[82] a similar effect has been
found with  xxxd3524xxx  treatment.[83] glp-1 is an important incretin, which in addition to its insulinotropic properties, has inhibitory effect on glucagon
secretion.[84] the relative contribution of these effects to the overall reduction in pphg by these
agents is not clearly defined.
although the gastric emptying rate is not altered
with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, the efficacy of  xxxd3524xxx  is increased in those with rapid gastric emptying.[85]
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2644xxx ,  xxxd3524xxx  and
especially of acarbose, has been well established.
large clinical trials have indicated that acarbose,
 xxxd2644xxx  or  xxxd3524xxx , reduce, on average, postprandial plasma glucose levels by approximately
2.7 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) and fasting plasma glucose
by 0.6 to 1.1 mmol/l (10 to 20 mg/dl).[65-75] hba1c
levels are reduced by 0.5 to 1% when acarbose is
used as monotherapy or as combination therapy
with sulphonylureas, metformin or insulin. as with
other antihyperglycaemic agents, the drop in hba1c
with acarbose depends on baseline glycaemic control. in general, the higher the baseline hba1c
level, the greater is the decrease in hba1c after
acarbose treatment.[86,87]
unlike the other oral antihyperglycaemic agents,
where the primary failure rate has been approxi© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

25

mately 15 to 20%, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have
been effective in all individuals who have consumed
adequate amounts of dietary chos, irrespective of
the duration of their diabetes mellitus or its severity.[73,88] however, the efficacy of this agent when
used as monotherapy may not be sufficient to
achieve the glycaemic goals in a large number of
patients who would require concomitant therapy
with additional classes of antihyperglycaemic agents.
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors do not promote bodyweight loss. however, when used in combination
with sulphonylureas, they have prevented sulphonylurea-associated bodyweight gain and have
reduced postprandial serum insulin concentrations.[73]
adverse effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors

the main adverse effects of this class of agents
are gastrointestinal in nature, notably flatulence and
loose stools. tolerance to the severity of these effects usually occurs with continued administration
over 3 months.[88] starting patients on lower doses
has assisted in identifying those sensitive to these
gastrointestinal adverse effects; these individuals
therefore require a very slow titration regimen.
2.2.4 meglitinide analogues

meglitinide is the nonsulphonylurea moiety of
 xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx ) or its analogue s-3075.[89]
 xxxd3098xxx , one of the several analogues of
meglitinide which has recently been approved by
the us federal drug administration for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is
an insulinotropic agent with a very short duration
of action. thus, its primary target is the amelioration of pphg.  xxxd3098xxx  augments glucoseinduced insulin stimulation through a decrease
in potassium conductance in islet cells.[89]
meglitinide analogues do not significantly enhance insulin output of pancreatic islets incubated
in the absence of nutrients.[90]
in a study comparing  xxxd3098xxx  with  xxxd2215xxx , the latter agent had a greater effect on
fasting blood glucose levels while  xxxd3098xxx  significantly lowered pphg.[91] in a recent randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed dose
study,[41] hypoglycaemic episodes increased with
drugs 1999 jan; 57 (1)

26

mooradian & thurman

increasing doses of  xxxd3098xxx . the incidence of
hypoglycaemic episodes was 11% in the placebo
group, 27% in the group receiving  xxxd3098xxx  1mg
and 36% in those randomised to receive  xxxd3098xxx  4mg daily. the high rate of hypoglycaemic
episodes in this fixed-dose clinical trial was partly
the result of a lack of gradual dose titration.[92] for
oral antihyperglycaemic agent-naive patients, mean
hba1c levels decreased from 9.3% at baseline to
7.6% and 7.6% at 24 weeks for the groups receiving 1 and 4mg  xxxd3098xxx , respectively. for previously treated patients, mean hba1c levels did not
significantly decrease following  xxxd3098xxx  treatment. however, in the placebo-treated group,
hba1c increased from a baseline level of 8.4% to
10% by the end of the study.[92] short term dose
response studies have suggested that the mean
blood glucose response to  xxxd3098xxx  levels off at
doses greater than 1mg.[93]
3. conclusions
several therapeutic agents are now available
which target pphg. a comparative profile of
these agents is summarised in table i. of those,
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are currently the most
commonly used oral agents for targeting pphg. a
suggested algorithm for the stepwise management
of pphg is shown in figure 2. the glycaemic goals
should be individualised. however, it is desirable
to limit postprandial excursions of blood glucose
to less than 8.9 mmol/l (160 mg/dl).
the cornerstone of management is lifestyle modifications including exercise and dietary changes,
notably reducing meal portions and gradually in-

creasing the fibre content of meals. if, after a 3
month trial, the glycaemic goal has still not been
achieved, then an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor can be
started at low doses and gradually increased until
either the goal is achieved or intolerance to the
agent develops. at the 3-month follow-up, if the
patient continues to have postprandial blood glucose values consistently over 8.9 mmol/l (160
mg/dl), then  xxxd3098xxx  should be added before
each meal. if the combination of dietary changes,
glucosidase inhibitor and  xxxd3098xxx  fail to achieve
the glycaemic goal at another 3 month follow-up,
the oral agents should then be discontinued and
insulin lispro started if the patient is a candidate for
insulin therapy. in such patients an intermediate or
long acting insulin preparation is usually needed to
achieve glycaemic goals.
because of the lack of a hypoglycaemic threat,
and more importantly the prospect of blood glucose control without hyperinsulinaemia and bodyweight gain, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be the
therapeutic agents of first choice. it is noteworthy
that there have not been therapeutic trials demonstrating the efficacy of the combination therapy of
 xxxd3098xxx  and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. in addition, it is not yet known whether  xxxd3098xxx  has
a clear clinical advantage compared with shortacting sulphonylureas such as  xxxd3394xxx . the algorithm presented in figure 2 is a suggested approach and patient management should be highly
individualised. it should be borne in mind that
other antihyperglycaemic agents are also quite useful in controlling postprandial blood glucose levels
and should be tried before resorting to insulin
therapy.

fig. 2. a suggested algorithm for the stepwise approach to the
management of postprandial hyperglycaemia. ppbg = post-

prandial blood glucose.

the recently published results from the united
kingdom prospective diabetes study (ukpds) reaffirm the need for optimising blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.[94,95] however,
at the present time, it has not been established if
pphg contributes to diabetes-related complications
independent of its contribution to overall glycaemic
control. however, common clinical experience indicates that it is more difficult to control pphg
than to achieve normal fasting or pre-prandial glucose levels. thus, the availability of agents which
preferentially reduce postprandial blood glucose
excursions enhances our ability to achieve the
glycaemic goals in a larger proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus.
