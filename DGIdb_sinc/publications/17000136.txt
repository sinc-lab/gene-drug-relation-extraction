excepting surgical resection, there is no efficient treatment against pancreatic cancer. the
chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine improves the patientts clinical status but survival is not
prolonged. the aim of this study was to design a new strategy to render gemcitabine more efficient
in the treatment of pancreatic cancer using gene therapy. we have generated a fusion gene
( xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx ) combining  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) and  xxxd870xxx  kinase ( xxxg478xxx ),
which converts gemcitabine into its toxic phosphorylated metabolite. antitumor effects of
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene expression were tested in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic transplantable model
of pancreatic cancer established in hamsters.  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine by reducing dramatically both in vitro cell viability and in vivo tumor volume. we found
that in vivo expression of  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  resulted in an antitumor bystander effect due to apoptosis of
untransduced cells. in vivo intratumoral gene transfer of  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  using the synthetic carrier pei
induced a potent tumor regression. taken together, the results show that the fusion gene
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment to induce cell death by
apoptosis and tumor regression. intratumoral delivery of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene in combination with
gemcitabine might be of high interest for pancreatic cancer management.

introduction
pancreatic ductal carcinoma is, at present, the fifth
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in western countries. its incidence has been increasing for the past 30
years. due to a long silent clinical phase during tumor
development and a late diagnosis, its prognosis is very
poor. the only curative treatment is surgical resection.
unfortunately, such approach is possible in only 10 to
15% of overall cases. following resection, only 5% of
patients have a 5-year survival, while the overall 5-year
survival rate does not exceed 3%. at the time of
diagnosis, 15 to 30% of patients have extensive metastasis, primarily to the liver, peritoneum, and lymph
system, and are therefore not amenable to resection [1,2].

yet, no effective therapy has so far been established to
alleviate this often fatal end-stage disease. as a palliative,
patients are treated using radiation or chemotherapeutic
compounds such as 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine. gemcitabine treatment is now considered as the first-line
therapy for unresectable and/or metastatic pancreatic
cancers. however, only a few clinical parameters, including pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and weight
changes, are ameliorated following gemcitabine administration. tumor volume is virtually unchanged as
survival remains extremely short [3,4]. clearly, a more
effective treatment is urgently needed.
preclinical strategies based on chemosensitization have
been developed to amplify the cytotoxic effect of clinically
used compounds [5]. these strategies include the use of
suicide genes, such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase (hsv-tk) and ganciclovir [6–8], escherichia coli
cytosine deaminase and  xxxd2119xxx  [9], and uracil

phosphoribosyltransferase and 5-fluorouracil systems [10].
however, gemcitabine is currently used most in patients.
gemcitabine (2v,2v-difluoro-2v- xxxd1836xxx ;  xxxd2188xxx ) is
a nucleoside analogue that is transported into cells [11]
where it must be sequentially converted into mono-, di-, or
triphosphorylated forms to exert its full cytotoxic activity.
in this cascade, the first two steps of phosphorylation are
rate limiting. in mammalian cells, gemcitabine conversion into gemcitabine monophosphate is performed by
the  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ;  xxxg611xxx ) [12–14].
then, the  xxxd870xxx  kinase ( xxxg478xxx ; ec
2.7.4.14) yields gemcitabine diphosphate [15,16]. gemcitabine derivatives exhibit antitumor activity either by
interfering with intracellular nucleotide pools or through
direct inhibition of dna synthesis. indeed, while the
diphosphate form is a potent inhibitor of the nucleotide
biosynthetic enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, the triphosphate form incorporates into the elongating dna
strand and blocks dna replication during the cell cycle.
the reactions catalyzed by  xxxg611xxx  and  xxxg478xxx  are considered rate limiting because their respective substrates
(gemcitabine and gemcitabine monophosphate) are labile
in tumoral cells due to increased deaminase activities
[17,18]. this could explain, at least in part, the relative
resistance of various solid tumors including non-smallcell lung, head and neck, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers
to gemcitabine [3,19,20]. also, resistance to gemcitabine
has been reported to involve a deficiency in the  xxxg611xxx 
enzyme [21], a decrease in nucleoside transport [22], and
an overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase [23].
thus, one way to render gemcitabine more efficient for
pancreatic cancer would be to reinforce its conversion into
stable and highly cytotoxic metabolites. to this end, we
have engineered a fusion cdna encoding both  xxxg611xxx  and
 xxxg478xxx  proteins. the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  fusion gene delivery was
then successfully tested for its capability to render
pancreatic cancer cells sensitive to gemcitabine both in
vitro and in vivo. furthermore, intratumoral injection of
the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  fusion gene coupled with gemcitabine
administration resulted in a significant regression of
pancreatic primary tumors, due to a potent, proapoptotic,
antitumoral bystander effect.

the expression of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  hybrid gene inhibits
growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo
based on these in vitro data, we next evaluated the
potential in vivo chemosensitization. thus, we implanted
stably expressing pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk cells as orthotopic
allografts in immune hamsters. on day 7, during the
exponential growth phase of primary pancreatic tumors,
we treated the animals with gemcitabine or vehicle, nacl
0.9%. we administered the gemcitabine four times at a
dose of 120 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally (ip) on days 7,
10, 13, and 16 post-cell engraftment. a 3-day interval
schedule has been shown to be active in human
carcinoma xenografts [27]. we observed no difference
between the two groups at days 7 and 16 following
gemcitabine administration (data not shown). however,
gemcitabine treatment resulted in significantly smaller
pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk tumors than did vehicle treatment
on day 28 ( p b 0.001), i.e., at the completion of the
observation period (fig. 3). the tumor volume was also
significantly lower compared to control tumors treated
with gemcitabine. we observed similar results at day 22
( p b 0.005—data not shown). these results demonstrated
that the combination of  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  expression with
gemcitabine ip administration prevented pancreatic
tumor growth. we also observed such an antitumoral
effect with longer kinetics; indeed, we observed a
complete regression of pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  tumors up to
36 days following gemcitabine administration (data
not shown). for comparison purposes, the growth of
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk-expressing tumors was significantly re-

ganciclovir (data not shown). to determine the sensitivity of these cell lines to gemcitabine or ganciclovir, we
generated cytotoxicity curves after 3 days of drug
exposure. we found that the concentrations of gemcitabine that resulted in 50% cytotoxicity (ic 50 ) for
pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk, pc1.0 wt, and pc1.0.lacz/gfp
cells were 0.00125, 0.0096, and 0.01 ag/ml, respectively
(fig. 2a). for comparison purposes, treatment of pc1.0
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk-expressing cells with ganciclovir resulted
in an ic50 value of 0.056 ag/ml, when we observed no
cytotoxic effect on pc1.0 wt and pc1.0.lacz/gfp cells
(fig. 2b). these results indicate that pc1.0 cells are
sensitive to gemcitabine treatment but demonstrate that
this sensitivity is strongly increased by  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx 
expression.

the expression of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  fusion gene induces
local antitumor bystander effects in pancreatic
primary mixed tumors
to assess whether the gemcitabine chemosensitizing
effect evoked by  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene expression in pc1.0
cells can influence the neighboring cells, by a so-called
‘‘bystander effect,’’ we conducted mixing experiments
with mixed allografts containing a 25:75 ratio of
pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk cells to pc1.0 wild-type cells. then,
8 days following implantation, we ip injected hamsters
bearing mixed tumors with vehicle, 60 or 120 mg/kg/day
gemcitabine at 3-day interval, or 37.5 or 75 mg/kg/day
gcv, as described above. as shown in fig. 4, gemcitabine
or gcv treatment significantly inhibited the growth of
primary pancreatic mixed tumors compared to untreated
tumors (vehicle) ( p b 0.0001 and p b 0.002 for gemcitabine and gcv treatment, respectively). however, the
antitumor bystander effect of the tk gene is less
important than that observed with the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene.
indeed, tumor growth progression after gcv administration was slowed down compared to the 50% tumor size
regression observed after gemcitabine treatment (data not
shown). in addition this effect was dose-dependent. at
day 22, pancreatic mixed tumor volume in hamsters
treated with 120 mg/kg gemcitabine was significantly

orthotopic tumor cell allograft, the animals received an ip injection of vehicle, 60

were measured at days 8 and 22 after median laparotomy. results are expressed
in tumor volume (mm3). all tumors from treated animals were significantly
smaller than those of animals receiving vehicle/nacl 0.9%. each data point is the

reduced compared to that of hamsters treated with a halfdose or that of untreated animals. taken together, these
results support the existence of a local antitumor
bystander effect induced dependent on  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  fusion
gene expression in pc1.0 pancreatic tumors. interestingly, combining treatment (gemcitabine at a dose of
60 mg/kg/day and gcv at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg/day) did
not potentiate the gemcitabine-mediated antitumoral
effect (data not shown from two experiments).
in vivo  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene transfer experiments using
the synthetic carrier polyethylenimine (pei)
we previously demonstrated that a synthetic polycationic pei vector is able to transduce pancreatic cancer
cells efficiently in vitro [25] and in vivo [24,26]. the
transgene is detectable at the mrna level at least 6 days
after in vivo gene transfer using such a carrier [24,28].
based on our data demonstrating that  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene
expression via intratumoral delivery enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity to pc1.0 cells in vitro and induced a
stronger local bystander effect compared to the tk gene
in vivo, we hypothesized that  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  might be an
effective chemosensitization gene for gene therapy of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
we administered pei/dna complexes intratumorally
to hamsters on day 8 after intrapancreatic inoculation of
pc1.0 wild-type cells and sacrificed the animals 10 days
later. animals injected or not with pei/ xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gfp or
pei/lacz/gfp complexes were treated with either vehicle
or gemcitabine at the dose of 120 mg/kg on days 10 (48 h
after gene transfer), 13, and 16. we measured the volume
of transplanted pancreatic tumors before and after in vivo
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene transfer. we observed no significant
difference in initial tumor volume (i.e., before gene
transfer) (fig. 5). ten days after gene transfer there was
no difference in tumor volume in hamsters injected with
either pei/ xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gfp or pei/lacz/gfp and treated
with nacl 0.9%. in these tumors, the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  transgene was readily detected by rt-pcr (data not shown).
gemcitabine administration induced an inhibition of the
growth of pancreatic tumors injected with pei/lacz/gfp
compared to vehicle-treated animals. these results
obtained after in vivo gemcitabine administration are in
agreement with our in vitro data, suggesting that wildtype pc1.0 cells were relatively sensitive to gemcitabine
(as also shown in fig. 3a). moreover, pancreatic tumor
progression was strongly impaired in hamsters injected
with pei/ xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gfp complexes treated with gemcitabine, compared to pei/ xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  complexes alone,
resulting in a dramatic regression of tumor growth (50%
compared to tumor volume before treatment—data not
shown). we did not observe such tumor regression in
control tumors injected with pei/lacz/gfp and treated
with gemcitabine. these results demonstrated that the in
vivo transfer of  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  strongly sensitizes pancreatic
tumors to gemcitabine cytotoxic action. in other words, a

mechanism of bystander effect induced by  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx 
gene transfer
the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine occur following the
induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. thus,
the latter could be essential in the bystander killing effect
generated following  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  in vivo gene transfer and
gemcitabine treatment. we first measured the in vitro
apoptosis induction using annexin-v labeling of cellular
clones stably expressing  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  or lacz/gfp genes,
24 to 48 h following treatment or no treatment with
gemcitabine. by 24 h, we measured a twofold increase in
cells undergoing apoptosis among cells expressing
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  and treated with 0.3 ag/ml gemcitabine,
compared to control-transfected cells (fig. 6). by 48 h,
the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was fivefold
higher in  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -transfected cells, compared to
control-transfected cells. these results indicate that
expression of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene markedly increases
the apoptotic effect of gemcitabine on pc1.0 pancreatic
cancer cells.
to confirm further the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -dependent apoptotic induction in a gene transfer setting, we transiently
transfected pc1.0 cells in vitro. transfected cells were
identified by the concomitant expression of the gfp

doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.07.010

marker. as shown in fig. 7, flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated that the percentage of  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -transfected cells that underwent apoptosis (i.e., percentage of
annexin-v-positive cells) was higher than that of the
gfp-positive cells (+32%), suggesting that apoptosis
induced by gemcitabine treatment was not solely
restricted to  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -expressing cells but also to
neighboring pc1.0 wild-type cells. to investigate
whether this phenomenon may occur in vivo, we looked
for  xxxg611xxx  expression and apoptosis-specific labeling on
serial tissue sections by the combination of immunohistochemistry for  xxxg611xxx  and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin
nick-end labeling (tunel) assay. we chose mixed and
control tumors treated or not with gemcitabine. as
shown in fig. 8a, mixed tumor cells still expressed
human  xxxg611xxx  14 days after gemcitabine treatment,
whereas control tumors were negative. interestingly, we
observed dna fragmentation not only in  xxxg611xxx -positive
cells, but also in transgene-free, wild-type tumor cells
(fig. 8b). this may indicate that  xxxg611xxx -expressing cells
treated with gemcitabine do generate an apoptotic signal
that diffuses to neighboring cells, to kill untransfected
cells. such bystander effect may account for the potent
antitumoral effect observed following the concomitant
treatment of pancreatic cancer tumors with gemcitabine
and  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene transfer.

discussion
gemcitabine itself is not active, but following transport
into the cell via facilitated diffusion, the drug is phosphorylated to its corresponding active, gemcitabine
triphosphate form. the first and rate-limiting event in
these phosphorylation steps is catalyzed by  xxxg611xxx . gemcitabine triphosphate is one of the most important
gemcitabine metabolites and is thought to lead to cell
death through its incorporation into dna [28]. gemcitabine is also unique among anti-metabolites in that it
inhibits dna synthesis via a specific process called
masked chain termination.
our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that
expression of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  hybrid gene results in
increased sensitivity of pancreatic cancer-derived cells to
the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine. these results agree
with previous studies that also demonstrate that the
transfer of  xxxg611xxx  cdna alone into a large panel of drugresistant tumor cells, such as gliosarcoma, lung carcinoma,
osteosarcoma, or pancreatic carcinoma cells, results in a
complete restoration of sensitivity in vitro or in vivo to
nucleoside analogues, including gemcitabine [12,18,29].
moreover,  xxxg611xxx  overexpression was associated with accumulation and retention of intracellular gemcitabine
nucleotide pools and increased levels of gemcitabine
incorporation into dna [30,13,18]. one can postulate
that such mechanisms are involved in  xxxg611xxx : xxxg478xxx -trans-

nontransduced cells as well as a long-term antitumor effect
is thus required for the success of such cancer gene
therapy. despite a low transgene expression rate (25 or
5–10% of tumor cells express  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene in respectively ex vivo mixing or in vivo experiments), we observed a
dramatic inhibition of tumor growth in  xxxg611xxx ::umkexpressing tumors. a strong  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -induced
bystander effect may therefore be responsible for this
therapeutic action. such a bystander effect has largely
been described in gene-directed prodrug therapy, but the
mechanisms are not fully characterized. it is noteworthy
that a killing bystander effect was eventually described
with the tk/gcv model and it was considered the most
efficient gene transfer system to generate an antitumor
bystander effect. interestingly, in our pancreatic cancer
model the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gemcitabine system was more
efficient than this well-characterized tk/gcv model. it
is likely that the local antitumor bystander effect could be
ascribed to apoptosis. indeed, the cytotoxic effects of
gemcitabine occur through the induction of programmed
cell death or apoptosis, which is determined by the
antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 cellular content in human
pancreatic carcinoma and requires caspase activation.
thus, a gemcitabine-mediated bystander killing effect
could result from the intercellular transfer of hydrolases
and apoptotic vesicles containing also cytotoxic phosphorylated metabolites of gemcitabine to neighboring
untransduced cells [24]. our in vitro and in vivo data may
support this hypothesis regarding the diffusion of apoptotic signal to the neighboring cells from the  xxxg611xxx ::umkexpressing cells. in addition we did not observe a
synergistic effect combining gemcitabine and gcv treatment in hamsters bearing mixed tumors, suggesting that
the mechanism of action of the two drugs could be in
common, such as apoptosis.
the success of gene therapy depends on efficient and
sufficient gene delivery systems and the selective expression of the therapeutic gene in tumor cells. adenovectors
are limited systems since they induce the subsequent
development of a neutralizing host immune response and
most of pancreatic cancer cells have a low level of
adenovirus receptors at their surface [31,32]. in this
context, use of a safe, nonviral vector for therapeutic gene
delivery, such as linear cationic polymers of pei, might be
of great interest. pei was chosen because of its relatively
high efficiency of gene delivery in pancreatic cancer cells
both in vitro [25] and in vivo [24,26,33,34]. in addition,
compared to cationic lipid carriers, pei may better protect
dna from enzyme degradation because of its best stability
in the pancreatic environment, known to be rich in lipid

wild-type cells at a ratio of 25:75 (5  105 cells per allograft). eight days after orthotopic tumor cell allograft, animals received ip injection of either vehicle or
120 mg/kg gemcitabine ( xxxd2188xxx ). (a) immunostaining for  xxxg611xxx  was performed 22 days following tumor implantation as described under materials and methods.
results representative of 15 successive high-power fields from three independent experiments were analyzed. (b) colocalization of  xxxg611xxx  immunoreactivity and

catabolism enzymes such as  xxxg428xxx  or pancreatic lipases that could destroy nonviral lipid molecules.
the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gemcitabine sensitizing system has a
number of potential advantages for cancer gene therapy
and potential clinical relevance, particularly for pancreatic
carcinoma: (i) nowadays, gemcitabine is the only chemotherapeutic agent used as first-line treatment of locally
advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer; (ii) as
opposed to hsv/tk and others currently utilized chemosensitization genes, such as cytosine deaminase or uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase, a fusion  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene is a
synthetic humanized gene and thus limits the chances of a
significant anti- xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  immunologic response in
humans; (iii)  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene expression is able to
enhance the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine chemotherapy locally by interacting in the metabolism/anabolism of the drug within the tumor cells. our encouraging in
vitro and in vivo data suggest that the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  gene/
gemcitabine system may be a powerful therapeutic
approach to in vivo gene therapy of pancreatic cancer.

gen co. (toulouse, france). gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemzar) was
purchased from eli lilly and co. (indianapolis, in, usa). ganciclovir
cymevan was from roche pharmaceuticals (basel, switzerland). the
synthetic linear polymers of pei (22 kda) used as transfection reagent
(exgen 500) were from euromedex (souffleweyersheim, france).
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx -expressing plasmids
the self-cleaving fmdv 2a peptide was inserted between  xxxg611xxx  and  xxxg478xxx 
cdnas to make the fusion cdna  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx . similarly, the thymidine
kinase cdna from herpes simplex virus type 1 was cloned in frame with a
zeocin-resistance cdna (cayla, toulouse, france). these genes were
subcloned in the pvivo plasmid (cayla). in pvivo, two glucoseregulated protein promoters ( xxxg1099xxx  and  xxxg1101xxx ), known to drive high
levels of expression under normal conditions and stronger expression
under stress conditions (such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia
prevailing inside tumors) are used to generate a high level of cpg-free
gene expression (cpg motifs were eliminated from nonmammalian genes
present in the plasmid backbone by chemical synthesis). three expression
vectors were generated: (i) pvivo coexpressing  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  and tk genes
( xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk) (fig. 1a), (ii) pvivo coexpressing  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  and the
green fluorescent protein gene ( xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gfp), and (iii) pvivo coexpressing lacz and the green fluorescent protein gene (lacz/gfp).
transfected cell lines
pc1.0 cells, derived from a pancreatic ductal carcinoma induced by nnitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine in syrian golden hamsters [24,25], were
maintained in rpmi 1640, supplemented with 5% fcs,  xxxd164xxx ,
antibiotics (streptomycin/penicillin), l-glutamine, and an anti-mycoplasma reagent (plasmocin; cayla). cells were kept at 378c and 5%
co2.  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk or lacz/gfp genes subcloned in the pvivo vector
were stably transfected using a cationic phosphonolipid reagent lyovec
(cayla invivogen). stable clonal cell populations were selected in the

presence of 0.4 to 0.6 mg/ml zeocin. stable transfectants (named
pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk cells and pc1.0.lacz/gfp cells) were then cultured in rpmi 1640 medium containing 5% svf and 0.3 mg/ml zeocin.
for transient transfection, pc1.0 cells or cos-7 cells (maintained in
dmem, supplemented with 10% fcs) were plated in 60-mm diameter
dishes (2  105 cells per dish in 4 ml of rpmi 1640 or dmem
containing 5 or 10% fcs). after a 12-h attachment phase, cells were
transfected with 5 ag of plasmid using pei 22-kda as transfection
reagent (ration n/p = 8 as described previously) [24–26].
rna isolation and rt-pcr assays
total rna from cultured cells or from mechanically homogenized tumor
tissues was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method as described previously [24,26]. to eliminate genomic dna,
total rna was subjected to an rnase-free dnase i treatment before reverse
transcription. expression of the  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx  fusion was visualized by rtpcr using a sense primer (5v-atggccaccccgcccaagaga-3v) specific
to  xxxg611xxx  and an antisense primer (5v-ttagccttccttgtcaa-3v) specific
to  xxxg478xxx , which yield a 1.4-kb fragment (fig. 1b). the pcr products were
separated on 7% polyacrylamide or 1% agarose gels using h-actin or
 xxxg861xxx  as internal control genes.
western blot analysis
cos-7 cells transiently transfected with pvivo plasmids coexpressing the
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk or lacz/gfp gene were cultured for 2 days and subjected to
western blot analysis using anti-human  xxxg611xxx  antibody 1:250 (gift from
dr. f. bontemps, university of louvain, ucl, brussels, belgium) as
described previously [26].
in vitro drug sensitivity assays
pc1.0 or pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk or pc1.0.lacz/gfp cells were plated in 35mm-diameter dishes at 4  103 cells/ml (2 ml per dish) in rpmi 1640
medium containing 5% fcs. after a 12-h attachment phase, cells were
cultured for 3 days in a fresh medium supplemented or not with
increasing concentrations of nucleoside analogues (0.003 to 0.3 ag/ml
gemcitabine or 0.1 to 30 ag/ml gcv). cell survival was measured by mts
according the manufacturerts instructions (promega, charbonnières-lesbains, france).
animals and experimental protocols
five-week-old male syrian golden hamsters (weight 70– xxxd1523xxx ) were
obtained from harlan france (gannat). the animals were acclimatized
in a temperature-controlled room under a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule
and received pelleted diet and water. hamsters were anesthetized for all
surgical procedures, by an ip injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). as
described previously, 5  105 pc1.0 cells resuspended in 100 al of fcsfree rpmi 1640 medium were orthotopically implanted (tail of the
pancreas) into hamsters [24,25] after minilateral laparotomy. all experiments were performed according to the rules of the animal ethical
committee. following sacrifice, tumors were immediately sampled either
in cold isopentane, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at
808c, or in formalin before subsequent manipulation. three sets of
experiments were conducted using groups of four to five animals, as
follows:
protocol 1: ex vivo gene therapy. pc1.0 wild-type or pc1.0. xxxg611xxx ::  xxxg478xxx /
tk or pc1.0.lacz/gfp cells were injected into the pancreatic tail of
hamsters to generate primary tumors. seven days after cell implantation,
animals bearing pancreatic tumors were divided into three groups and
treated with nacl 0.9%,  xxxd2188xxx , or gcv. gemcitabine was given by single
ip injections on days 7, 10, 13, and 16 post-cell implantation at a dose
of 120 mg/kg body wt [27]. gcv was given once a day for 7 days (days 7
to 14 post-cell implantation) at a dose of 75 mg/kg body wt (ip
injection) [28]. tumor size was measured in situ with calipers at days 7
(before drug administration), 16, 22, and 28 after median laparotomy
under pentobarbital anesthesia. tumor volume in cubic millimeters and
tumor progression rate were determined as described [24,26].

protocol 2: ex vivo mixed-population experiments. to evaluate the local
bystander effect, pancreatic tumors were generated by inoculating
mixed populations of pc1.0. xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk and pc1.0 wild-type cells
into the pancreatic tail of hamsters at a ratio of 25:75 (5  105 cells per
allograft). eight days later, tumor volume (called mixed tumors) was
measured as described above after median laparotomy under anesthesia
and then animals were ip injected with nacl 0.9%, 60 or 120 mg/kg
gemcitabine, or 37.5 or 75 mg/kg gcv, or combination of 60 mg/kg
gemcitabine plus 37.5 mg/kg gcv as described above. tumor volumes
and progression were measured after sacrifice at day 22 post-cell
implantation.
protocol 3: in vivo gene therapy. pancreatic tumors were generated by
inoculating pc1.0 wild-type cells into the pancreatic tail of hamsters.
eight days later, after median laparotomy under anesthesia, tumor
volume was measured and an intratumoral gene transfer was performed
using pei 22-kda (ratio pei nitrogen to dna phosphate n/p = 10) in 5%
w/v glucose as described [24]. pei/dna complexes were then injected
into exponentially growing tumors using a sterile 29-gauge lymphography catheter set with a flow rate of 25 al/min. a total of 25 ag of
 xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /gfp or lacz/gfp expression vectors was injected. animals
were then ip injected with nacl 0.9% or gemcitabine 120 mg/kg, as
described above under experimental protocols 1 and 2. tumor volumes
and progression were evaluated after sacrifice at day 18 post-cell
implantation.
assessment of in vitro annexin-v expression using facs analysis
pc1.0 cells transiently or stably transfected with pvivo plasmids coexpressing  xxxg611xxx :: xxxg478xxx /tk or lacz/gfp genes were cultured in 60-mm-diameter
dishes in complete medium before treatment or no treatment with 0.3 ag/
ml gemcitabine for 24 and 48 h. annexin-v labeling was measured on
10,000 events by flow cytometry following the manufacturerts instructions (becton–dickinson, sunnyvale, ca, usa) using cellquest software on a
facscalibur station (becton–dickinson).
immunohistochemical staining for  xxxg611xxx  and in situ tunel assay
four-micrometer-thick serial sections were prepared from paraffin-embedded specimens as described [24,26], before overnight incubation with
anti-human  xxxg611xxx  antibody (1:400). following incubation with hrpcoupled secondary antibodies, immunostaining was revealed using 3,3vdiaminobenzidine (sigma co., st. louis, mo, usa). slides were counterstained with mayerts hematoxylin. negative control slides were prepared
by replacing the primary antibody with pbs. tunel staining was
performed as described [24] using the in situ cell death detection kit
apopdetek (enzo diagnostics, inc., farmingdale, ny, usa), according to
the manufacturerts instructions. slides were counterstained with mayerts
hematoxylin.
