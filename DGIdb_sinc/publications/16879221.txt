summary. background: several proatherothrombotic conditions are associated with enhanced levels of circulating proinﬂammatory cytokines, which are believed to impair endothelial
ﬁbrinolytic capacity. objective: this study aims at investigating
how  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a regulates endothelial gene
expression of the key ﬁbrinolytic enzyme  xxxg1766xxx  ( xxxg1766xxx ). methods: cultured human umbilical vein
endothelial cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors of the
three major inﬂammatory signaling pathways activated by
 xxxg2296xxx ; the nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-jb), the p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (p38 mapk), and the c-jun n-terminal
kinase (jnk) pathways. following  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation, eﬀects
on  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression were evaluated with real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and interactions of
nuclear proteins with potential gene regulatory elements were
studied with electrophoretic mobility shift assays. results:
approximately 50% suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression was
observed after prolonged stimulation with  xxxg2296xxx  (‡24 h). the
repression was shown to be preferentially dependent on nf-jb
activation, but also on p38 mapk signaling. further, we
provide evidence for a  xxxg2296xxx  induced binding of nf-jb to the
recently described jb site in the  xxxg1766xxx  gene and of cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  response element binding protein
(creb) to the  xxxg1766xxx  cre-like site. conclusions: we conclude
that  xxxg2296xxx  impairs ﬁbrinolytic capacity in vascular endothelial
cells by a nf-jb and p38 mapk-dependent suppression of
 xxxg1766xxx . this mechanism sheds a light on how inﬂammation
contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.

introduction
myocardial infarctions and a substantial part of ischemic
strokes are caused by activation of intravascular clotting
mechanisms that, when unopposed, can progress rapidly into
formation of an occluding arterial thrombus. to protect
against this, the vascular endothelium of healthy individuals
has the capacity to activate an acute thromboprotective
response if intravascular clotting should occur. an important
element of this response is acute release of the key ﬁbrinolytic
enzyme  xxxg1766xxx  ( xxxg1766xxx ). to be
effective, rapid mobilization of  xxxg1766xxx  from the endothelium is
essential, because thrombus dissolution is much more effective
when  xxxg1766xxx  is incorporated during, rather than after, thrombus
formation [1]. however, in case of an imbalanced endogenous
ﬁbrinolysis, intravascular thrombus formation may propagate,
ultimately leading to arterial occlusion and tissue infarction [2].
several proatherothrombotic conditions are associated with
a low-grade inﬂammation and increased circulating levels of
proinﬂammatory cytokines are frequently observed in patients
with, for example, atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and
hypertension [3].  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ) is central
as one of the most important promoters of inﬂammation.
proinﬂammatory cytokines have been reported to suppress
endothelial ﬁbrinolytic activity, most evidently reﬂected by an
elevated expression of the main inhibitor of  xxxg1766xxx , plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 [4,5]. the literature is, however, somewhat
conﬂicting regarding the effects of proinﬂammatory cytokines
on the expression of  xxxg1766xxx , with most in vitro data supporting a
suppressive effect on  xxxg1766xxx  expression [4,5], in contrast to in vivo
observations reporting stimulatory effects [6,7]. further, the
intracellular signaling pathways mediating the effects on  xxxg1766xxx 
expression are presently unknown.

1782 e. ulfhammer et al

the aim of the present study was to investigate how moderate
doses of the proinﬂammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx  affects gene
expression of  xxxg1766xxx  and to elucidate by which intracellular
signaling pathways the effects are mediated. to examine this we
used cultured vascular endothelial cells pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors against the three major inﬂammatory
signaling pathways activated by  xxxg2296xxx ; the nuclear factor
kappa-b (nf-jb), the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38 mapk), and the c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) pathways
[8,9]. effects of  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation were evaluated on the level of
mrna expression of  xxxg1766xxx , by examining expression patterns of
the main  xxxg2296xxx  inducible transcription factors nf-jb and
 xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1), and by studying interactions of these
mediators with putative binding sites in the  xxxg1766xxx  promoter.
materials and methods
cell culture

fresh umbilical cords were obtained from the maternity ward
of the hospital and human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(huvecs) were prepared by collagenase (sigma-aldrich,
st louis, mo, usa) digestion [10]. cells were maintained in
egm-2 complete culture medium, consisting of ebm-2 basal
medium (clonetics/cambrex, walkersville, md, usa) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and growth factors
(singlequots kit; clonetics) and incubated at 37 c in a
humidiﬁed 5% co2 incubator. sub-cultures were obtained by
trypsin/edta (sigma-aldrich) treatment of conﬂuent monolayers. cells at passage 1 were used in all experiments.
experimental design

huvecs were seeded in plastic culture plates or plastic culture
ﬂasks (nunc, roskilde, denmark) and grown to conﬂuence. on
the day of experiment, cells were added fresh egm-2 culture
medium with or without signaling pathway inhibitors. cells
were thereafter placed in a cell culture incubator for 1 h before
stimulation with 0.1–10 ng ml)1 of human recombinant  xxxg2296xxx  (sigma-aldrich) for up to 48 h. inhibitors were present during
the whole experiments. six lm parthenolide (sigma-aldrich) or
6 lm bay 11–7082 (calbiochem, darmstadt, germany) were
used to inhibit nf-jb signaling, 25 lm  xxxd3177xxx  (biosource,
nivelles, belgium) to inhibit p38 mapk, and 10 lm  xxxd3231xxx 
(calbiochem) to inhibit jnk. cell cultures for mrna studies
were performed in duplicate and on huvecs from three to six
individuals, while cultures for electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (emsa) and western blotting experiments were performed on cells from at least three individuals.
real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr)

total rna was isolated using rneasy mini kit (qiagen,
hilden, germany) and contaminations of dna were removed
by the qiagen optional dnase digestion step. rna concen-

trations and purity were determined with absorbance measures
at 260/280 nm wavelength and rna quality was controlled on
1% agarose gel. mrna was converted to cdna with
geneamp rna pcr kit (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca, usa).
levels of  xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg2406xxx , and icam-1 mrna were
analyzed with real-time rt-pcr, performed on a abi prism
7700 sequence detection system (applied biosystems), using
the comparative ct method (user bulletin #2; applied
biosystems).  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) was used as an endogenous internal standard to
correct for potential variation in rna loading, cdna
synthesis, or efﬁciency of pcr ampliﬁcation. samples were
ampliﬁed in duplicate.
oligonucleotide primers and taqman probes for quantiﬁcation of  xxxg1766xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  mrna were designed from the
genbank database using primer express version 1.5 (applied
biosystems), whereas  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 mrna were
quantiﬁed with taqman assays-by-designtm (applied biosystems). the oligonucleotide sequences were as follows;  xxxg1766xxx 
forward primer (fp): 5¢-ggccttgtctcctttctattcg3¢,  xxxg1766xxx  reverse primer (rp): 5¢-agcggctggatgggtacag-3¢,  xxxg1766xxx  probe (pr): 5¢-tgacatgagcctccttcagccgct-3¢,  xxxg2406xxx  fp: 5¢-ggaagaagcagaaaggaagtggaat-3¢,  xxxg2406xxx  rp: 5¢-gacactctcagaaggaaaagctgta-3¢,  xxxg2406xxx  pr: 5¢-ccaagttactccaaaagac-3¢, icam-1 fp: 5¢-ccaggagacactgcagaca-3¢, icam-1 rp: 5¢-tggcttcgtcagaatcacgtt-3¢, icam-1 pr: 5¢-accatctacagctttcc-3¢,
 xxxg861xxx  fp: 5¢-ccacatcgctcagacaccat-3¢,  xxxg861xxx  rp: 5¢-ccaggcgcccaatacg-3¢ and  xxxg861xxx  pr:
5¢-aaggtgaaggtcggagtcaacggatttg-3¢. each
primer pair was selected so the amplicon spanned an exon
junction to avoid ampliﬁcation of genomic dna. all probes
were dual-labeled with 5¢-reporter dye fam (6-carboxyﬂuorescein) and 3¢-quencher dye tamra (6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine).
cdna from 30 ng of total rna, taqman universal pcr
mastermix (applied biosystems), 10 pmol of each primer and
5 pmol probe (0.42 ll 60x assays-by-design mix for  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1) were mixed for each reaction in a ﬁnal volume
of 25 ll.
preparation and labeling of oligonucleotides

consensus oligonucleotides for nf-jb and ap-1 (promega,
madison, wi, usa) and two 22-bp double-stranded t-paspeciﬁc oligomers were used as emsa probes. one oligomer
(5¢-agggccggggattcccagtcta-3¢) contained the
recently described functional jb element found at position
bp )3081 to )3072 in the  xxxg1766xxx  gene of human neuronal cells
[11] and the other (5¢-attcaatgacatcacggctgtg3¢) the  xxxg1766xxx  cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp) response
element (cre)-like site [12]. the t-pacre differs in one
central nucleotide from the consensus cre sequence, changing
it to a sequence resembling an ap-1 binding sequence [13].

labeling was performed using t4 polynucleotide kinase (usb,
cleveland, oh, usa) and [c)32p]atp ( xxxd83xxx ) (amersham biosciences, buckinghamshire, uk). oligomer processing and preparation for emsas were performed
as described by costa et al. [14], with the exclusion of the
annealing step in labeling of the consensus probes.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay

preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as previously
described [15] and protein concentrations were quantiﬁed with
a ﬂuorometer (fluostar optima; bmg labtechnologies,
offenburg, germany) using bio-rad (hercules, ca, usa)
reagents. five micrograms of nuclear protein extract in 2 ll
osborne buffer d (10 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 50 mm kcl, 2 nm
mgcl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phmeso2f, 0.2 mm
edta, 20% glycerol; sigma-aldrich) [15], was preincubated
on ice for 15 min with 1 ll poly[d(i-c)] [polydeoxy(inosinatecytidylate)] (1 lg; used as a non-speciﬁc competitor; roche,
in, usa) and 3 ll smk buffer (12 mm spermidine, 12 mm
mgcl2, and 200 mm kcl; sigma-aldrich) [16]. 32p-labeled
probe (4 ll; 100 counts per second diluted in buffer d) was
then added and incubated for another 15 min on ice before
being applied to a native 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/
bis 29: 1; bio-rad) containing 0.25 · tbe buffer (invitrogen,
paisley, uk). after electrophoresis gels were vacuum heatdried and subjected to autoradiography. to identify speciﬁc
proteins involved in dna-binding, supershift experiments
were performed using antibodies (santa cruz biotech, santa
cruz, ca, usa) against huvec-expressed subunits of the
nf-jb complex [9]; p50 (#sc-1190), p65 (#sc-7151) and c-rel
(#sc-70), and against huvec t-pacre binding proteins [12];
camp response element binding protein (creb) (#sc-271),
 xxxg206xxx  (atf-2) (#sc-187) and c-jun
(#sc-1694). supershift experiments were performed according
to the same procedure as that described for standard emsas,
except that 2 ll (4 lg total) speciﬁc antibody was added to the
nuclear extracts at the same time as the labeled oligomer. the
extracts were then incubated with probe and antibody for 1 h
on ice before being loaded on the gel.

temperature. proteins were visualized using supersignal
chemiluminescent substrate (pierce biotechnology, rockford,

statistics

the statistical evaluation was performed using a paired
student’s t-test. data are presented as mean and standard
error of the mean. all comparisons are speciﬁed in the ﬁgure
legends and were performed between samples from the same
experiment and time-point to check for statistical signiﬁcance.
a p-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
results
 xxxg2296xxx  suppresses  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression

prolonged stimulation (‡24 h) of huvecs with  xxxg2296xxx 
resulted in a distinct reduction of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression, while
a less pronounced reduction was observed after 6 h (fig. 1).
the reduction attained statistical signiﬁcance at the two later
time-points and with all three studied doses of  xxxg2296xxx  (0.1, 1.0
and 10 ng ml)1). the two higher doses resulted in 65%
suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression compared to untreated
control cells. the lowest dose, 0.1 ng ml)1, was less effective in
reducing  xxxg1766xxx  mrna, but still resulted in 50% reduction after
24 h and 25% reduction after 48 h.

parthenolide increased basal  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression by
approximately 50% (p < 0.05 compared to control cells)
and partly inhibited the suppressive effect of  xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 2a).
 xxxg2296xxx  stimulation of parthenolide treated cells resulted in
20% reduction of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression compared to 48%
reduction in the absence of parthenolide (p < 0.05). despite
the absence of a complete inhibition, the  xxxg1766xxx  mrna response
in parthenolide and  xxxg2296xxx  treated cells showed no statistical
difference compared to the response in parthenolide treated

signaling in the regulation of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression (fig. 2b).
although somewhat less pronounced than with nf-jb inhibition, p38 mapk inhibition reduced the suppressive effect of
 xxxg2296xxx  on  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression (27% compared to 48%,
p < 0.05). in addition, comparable experiments with a lower
dose of  xxxd3177xxx  (10 lm) resulted in a similar induction of
basal  xxxg1766xxx  mrna, but a somewhat less distinct reduction of
the  xxxg2296xxx  mediated  xxxg1766xxx  suppression (41% compared to
55%, p ¼ 0.08). similar to nf-jb, the ﬁndings show that
activation of the p38 mapk pathway also has a suppressive
effect on  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression.

reduction of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression (p < 0.01 compared to

 xxxd3231xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx , showed that jnk signaling was of less
importance for the  xxxg2296xxx -induced suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  gene
expression. this was illustrated by a similar reduction of  xxxg1766xxx 
mrna as in cells without jnk inhibition. thus, in contrast to
nf-jb and p38 mapk, activity of the jnk pathway increases
 xxxg1766xxx  expression.

stimulation of parthenolide and  xxxd3177xxx  treated cells resulted
in a 4.5-fold induction of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna compared to untreated
control cells (39% induction compared to parthenolide and
 xxxd3177xxx  treated cells). this induction showed a highly
statistical difference compared to the  xxxg2296xxx  induced suppression observed in the absence of inhibitors (p < 0.001). taken
together, these data further corroborate the notion of two
suppressive signaling pathways (nf-jb and p38 mapk) and
one inductive (jnk) for the  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression in huvecs.
further, jnk signaling was again observed to be involved in
basal  xxxg1766xxx  expression, as each inhibitor combination including
 xxxd3231xxx  (fig. 3) resulted in a similar reduction of  xxxg1766xxx 
mrna expression as observed when cells were treated with
only  xxxd3231xxx  (fig. 2c).  xxxd3231xxx  impeded the inductive
effect of parthenolide and  xxxd3177xxx , both when added in single
combination with either of the two other inhibitors, but also
when all three substances were used simultaneously. however,
in contrast to other  xxxd3231xxx  combinations, the latter combination of all three inhibitors resulted in a partial reduction of
the  xxxg2296xxx  induced  xxxg1766xxx  mrna suppression. in these
experiments,  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression was suppressed by 29% in
response to  xxxg2296xxx  (compared to 52% suppression with  xxxg2296xxx  only, p < 0.05).

directed against the nf-jb subunit c-rel.
interestingly, the intensity of the p50/p65-complex was
observed to be reduced by parthenolide and bay 11–7082, both
in presence and absence of  xxxg2296xxx . this conﬁrmed the
inhibitory effect of both nf-jb inhibitors (fig. 4). inhibition
of p38 mapk with  xxxd3177xxx  had no effect on the interactions
with the consensus nf-jb probe when used alone, but
attenuated the p50/p65-complex when used in combination
with parthenolide (fig. 5). this effect of p38 mapk inhibition
was observed with or without stimulation with  xxxg2296xxx . the
reduction of the p50/p65-complex was relatively weak,
nevertheless indicating that p38 mapk inhibition augments
the inhibitory effect of parthenolide on nf-jb activation by
 xxxg2296xxx .
as expected, nuclear extracts from  xxxg2296xxx  stimulated cells
produced much stronger shifts than nuclear extracts from
untreated control cells in emsa reactions with the consensus
ap-1 probe (fig. 7). the induction of ap-1 by  xxxg2296xxx  was also
observed to be time- and dose-dependent as the shifts were
consistently stronger at 3 h and with the higher dose
(10 ng ml)1). the same pattern as for ap-1 was observed in
emsa experiments with the t-pacre probe. furthermore,
the increased binding to the t-pacre probe by  xxxg2296xxx 
stimulation was observed to be counteracted by p38 mapk
inhibition, most notably in samples stimulated for 24 h
(fig. 8). supershift experiments identiﬁed the  xxxg2296xxx  induced
t-pacre complex to represent binding of creb but not

 xxxg2296xxx  suppresses  xxxg1766xxx  expression 1787
 xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 mrna expression

discussion

analyses of  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 mrna conﬁrmed the
stimulatory effect of  xxxg2296xxx  and the inhibitory effect of the
selective signaling pathway inhibitors. stimulation with  xxxg2296xxx 
was accompanied by an approximately 20-fold induction of
both  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 gene expression (fig. 10). inhibition of nf-jb with parthenolide reduced basal expression as
well as the induction of both genes and conﬁrmed the
involvement of nf-jb in  xxxg2296xxx  mediated  xxxg2406xxx  and
icam-1 induction [17,18]. a less pronounced reduction of the
 xxxg2296xxx  induced  xxxg2406xxx  expression, together with a reduction
of basal  xxxg2406xxx  expression, was observed when p38 mapk
was inhibited by  xxxd3177xxx . the involvement of p38 mapk
activity in the regulation of  xxxg2406xxx  expression is in agreement with the literature, although p38 mapk is reported to
regulate  xxxg2406xxx  expression at the post-transcriptional level
[19]. corresponding reductions was not observed for icam-1
and veriﬁed the lack of p38 mapk signaling in regulation of
icam-1 expression [19,20]. inhibition of jnk with  xxxd3231xxx 
was observed to induce basal expression of the two genes but
had no effect on the stimulated induction by  xxxg2296xxx .

the present study shows that stimulation of huvecs with the
prototypical proinﬂammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx  results in a
suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression. using synthetic inhibitors
against speciﬁc  xxxg2296xxx  triggered signaling pathways, we show
that the suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna is most likely an effect of
preferentially nf-jb activation, but that also p38 mapk
signaling contribute to the  xxxg2296xxx  induced  xxxg1766xxx  reduction.
besides an enhanced nuclear localization of nf-jb, potentially
binding to the  xxxg1766xxx  jb site, other effector molecules might be
the transcription factor creb, binding to the cre-like site in
the  xxxg1766xxx  promoter. further, we show that nf-jb, p38 mapk,
and jnk signaling are all involved in regulation of basal  xxxg1766xxx 
gene expression. our data suggest that activation of the nf-jb
and p38 mapk pathways reduces transcriptional activity of
 xxxg1766xxx , while jnk activity acts by stimulating  xxxg1766xxx  gene
expression.
although  xxxg2296xxx -induced effects on  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression
have been reported in other cell types, few studies have
investigated effects of this cytokine on  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression in endothelial cells. indeed, the literature is limited to a
few reports describing reductions of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna in response
to  xxxg2296xxx  [4,12,21] and one report describing an induction
[22]. the reason for the discrepancies in the latter study could
be due to the relative short end-point for the  xxxg1766xxx  mrna
analyses (4 h) or to the high  xxxg2296xxx  dose used in the
experiments (50 ng ml)1). in the same report by gingras et
al. [22], it is also reported on a gene reporter assay performed
with the human  xxxg1766xxx  promoter. this assay showed a rapid
but transient activation of the  xxxg1766xxx  promoter with  xxxg2296xxx 
stimulation, that returned to baseline already 1 h after onset
of stimulation. the reduced  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression in the
present study (observed after 24 and 48 h of  xxxg2296xxx 
stimulation) could therefore reﬂect a quite different scenario
of activity in the  xxxg1766xxx  promoter. furthermore, this is likely to
more closely resemble the in vivo situation with chronic
elevated cytokine levels.
exposure of endothelial cells to  xxxg2296xxx  results in activation
of three major proinﬂammatory signaling pathways: the nfjb pathway; the p38 mapk pathway; and the jnk pathway
[8,9]. these signaling cascades interact through a complex
network, which mediate gene regulatory effects primarily by
activation of the two transcription factors nf-jb and ap-1
[9,23]. it is likely that the  xxxg2296xxx -induced suppression of  xxxg1766xxx 
observed in the present report is an effect of preferential nf-jb
activation, as we observed a decreased nuclear localization of
nf-jb and an almost complete counteraction of the suppressed  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression upon inhibition of the nf-jb
signaling pathway. it is therefore of interest that a functional
jb element has been detected at position bp )3081 to )3072 in
the  xxxg1766xxx  gene of human neuronal cells [11]. in emsa
experiments directed against this element we observed almost
identical interactions as in emsas employing the consensus
nf-jb probe, indicating a possible involvement of the  xxxg1766xxx  jb
element in the  xxxg2296xxx  induced suppression of  xxxg1766xxx .

moreover, emsa supershift experiments in the present
study identiﬁed translocated nf-jb dimers to contain p50 and
p65 subunits. however, two supershifts were observed using
the p50 antibody, indicating presence of both translocated p50/
p65 heterodimers and p50/p50 homodimers. it is tempting to
speculate that the latter is involved in the  xxxg2296xxx  induced
suppression of  xxxg1766xxx , as the p50/p50 homodimer generally
functions as a transcriptional repressor because of the lack of a
transactivating domain in the p50 subunit [24].
on the other hand, the reduced  xxxg1766xxx  suppression in
experiments with p38 mapk inhibition could be an effect of
an inhibited activation of ap-1. in the present emsa
experiments we observed increased interactions of nuclear
proteins from  xxxg2296xxx  stimulated cells with both the ap-1 and
the t-pacre probe. the ability of the t-pacre-like site to
bind ap-1 dimers [13,25] together with the similarity in patterns
between the ap-1 and the t-pacre emsas suggests that an
enhanced binding of ap-1 to the cre-like site in the  xxxg1766xxx 
promoter could be a part of the suppressed  xxxg1766xxx  expression in
response to  xxxg2296xxx . however, supershift experiments with
antibodies directed against endothelial t-pacre-binding proteins [12] detected a complete supershift of the  xxxg2296xxx  induced
complex with the creb antibody and not with antibodies
speciﬁc for atf-2 or c-jun. the complex was also observed to
be reduced by inhibition of p38 mapk. taken together these
data indicate that creb could be involved in the suppression
of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna. in this context it is of interest that inhibition of
p38 mapk with  xxxd3177xxx  has been reported to block  xxxg2296xxx 
induced creb activation [26], and that creb binding to the
t-pacre has been reported to mediate phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx 
13-acetate (pma) induced down-regulation of  xxxg1766xxx  in ht1080 ﬁbrosarcoma cells [14].
the p38 mapk pathway has also been reported to increase
binding of nf-jb to chromatin, at least partly by phosphorylation and phosphoacetylation of histone h3, leading to
loosening of the nucleosome and an enhanced accessibility to
nf-jb binding sites [27]. although somewhat speculative, the
abolished suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  mrna expression observed
with combined inhibition of nf-jb and p38 mapk signaling
could therefore be an effect of a reduced translocation of
nf-jb dimers to the nucleus together with a reduced access to
nf-jb binding sites in the  xxxg1766xxx  promoter. a reduced binding
to the nf-jb probe was also observed in the experiments with
combined nf-jb and p38 mapk inhibition, but this
additional effect of p38 mapk inhibition rather indicates a
reduced translocation of nf-jb to the nucleus.
regarding secretion of  xxxg1766xxx  protein in  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated
endothelial cell cultures, the literature is relatively consistent
and shows similar effects as those observed on the level of gene
expression. several reports describe a reduced  xxxg1766xxx  secretion in
response to  xxxg2296xxx  [4,5,21], some report small reductions or
unaltered secretion [28,29], but only a single study reports an
induction of secreted  xxxg1766xxx  in cultured endothelial cells [22]. by
contrast, in vivo studies on humans have shown substantial
inductions of  xxxg1766xxx  release when challenged with  xxxg2296xxx 
[6,7,30]. however, the experimental design and interpretation

of obtained data in the three studies are somewhat different. in
the perfused-forearm model used by chia et al. [6], healthy
subjects received intraarterial infusions of  xxxg2296xxx  for 1 h and
was monitored for  xxxg1766xxx  release during 4 h. the authors report
a gradual and sustained increase in  xxxg1766xxx  release and conclude
that  xxxg2296xxx , besides the proﬁbrinolytic increase in  xxxg1766xxx  release,
also is associated with an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotor responses. van hinsbergh et al. [7] studied
cancer patients that during 24 h received a continuous i.v.
infusion of  xxxg2296xxx . they reported elevated plasma concentrations of  xxxg1766xxx  after 3 and 24 h of infusion, but speculate that
this response may be secondary to a concomitant tnf-ainduced generation of thrombin. finally, van der poll et al. [30]
studied healthy subjects after an i.v. bolus injection of  xxxg2296xxx 
and observed a rapid release of  xxxg1766xxx , which peaked at 1 h, and
was followed by a subsequent inhibition of the ﬁbrinolytic
system.
taken together, available data from different experimental
set-ups indicate that  xxxg2296xxx  has an early stimulatory effect on
 xxxg1766xxx , which shifts to a suppressing mode following prolonged
stimulation. based on the present results, we conclude that
long-term stimulation of cultured vascular endothelial cells
with moderate doses of the proinﬂammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx 
results in a suppression of  xxxg1766xxx  gene expression. further, we
show that this is primarily an effect of nf-jb activation, but
we also point out the importance of p38 mapk signaling. this
impairment of the ﬁbrinolytic capacity could be one of the ways
by which inﬂammation contributes to the pathogenesis of
cardiovascular diseases.
