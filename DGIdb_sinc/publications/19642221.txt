abstract
although the  xxxg2282xxx  receptor was discovered in 1991 and
 xxxg2282xxx  (tpo) was puriﬁed in 1994, the development of a
clinically useful tpo was hampered by the appearance of neutralizing antibodies to some forms of recombinant tpo. however, in 2008
two new drugs that mimic the effect of tpo became available to treat
thrombocytopenia. romiplostim is a tpo peptide mimetic given by
subcutaneous injection that activates the tpo receptor by binding to
the distal hematopoietic receptor domain just like tpo.  xxxd1982xxx 
is a tpo nonpeptide mimetic administered orally that activates the
tpo receptor by binding to the transmembrane domain. both increase
the platelet count in healthy humans as well as in >80% of patients
with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (itp). although initially restricted to the second-line treatment of itp, both agents could help
treat many thrombocytopenic disorders. both agents are well tolerated, with mild headache being the most common complaint. potential
long-term complications include thrombosis, increased bone marrow
reticulin, rebound worsening of thrombocytopenia upon discontinuation, and increased blast formation. ongoing studies should establish
the incidence of these complications and determine the efﬁcacy of these
new agents in a variety of other thrombocytopenic conditions.

introduction
drugs that mimic the effect of  xxxg2282xxx 
(tpo) are now available for the treatment of
some forms of thrombocytopenia. although its
existence was ﬁrst proposed in 1958 (1), almost
40 years of investigation passed before tpo
was ﬁnally puriﬁed and cloned by ﬁve separate
groups in 1994 (2–6). it was called  xxxg2282xxx , megapoietin, megakaryocyte growth and
development factor, or  xxxg1442xxx  ligand. the last
name,  xxxg1442xxx  ligand, indicated that it bound the
 xxxg1442xxx  receptor, a hematopoietic cytokine receptor of unclear function that had been identiﬁed in 1991 (7). we now know that the  xxxg1442xxx 
receptor is the tpo receptor and that it binds

the subsequent clinical development of
tpo has had its ups and downs, accounting
for the 14-year lag time between discovery and
clinical approval of a drug. two ﬁrst-generation
recombinant tpos, recombinant human tpo
(rhtpo) and pegylated recombinant human
 xxxg2282xxx  (peg-rhumgdf), entered clinical trials
in multiple areas in 1995, but development
was stopped when antibodies formed to pegrhumgdf. subsequently, a number of nonimmunogenic tpo peptide, tpo nonpeptide,
and tpo antibody mimetics were developed,
and two have just entered clinical practice.

 xxxg2282xxx 
structure, function,
and physiology
tpo is unlike most other hematopoietic
growth factors. a large molecule of 95 kda (333
amino acids), it contains 153 amino-terminal
residues that are 23% identical (50% homologous) with erythropoietin (epo), and as in
epo they are organized into four alpha helices (figure 1) (8, 9). this part of tpo binds
the tpo receptor, and the crystal structure
of this interaction is now known (10): each
tpo molecule binds two tpo receptors, one
via a high-afﬁnity (1.1 × 10−9 m) binding site
composed of 13 amino acids and the other
via a low-afﬁnity (3.3 × 10−9 m) binding site
composed of 11 amino acids. the importance
of having two tpo receptor binding sites in
each tpo molecule will become more apparent when novel tpo mimetics are discussed
below.
the rest of the tpo molecule (residues
154–333) is a unique sequence and contains a
number of important glycosylation sites. in the
absence of this segment, tpo has a circulatory
half-life of minutes; in its presence, tpo has a
half-life of 40 h.
the tpo receptor is found on megakaryocyte precursor cells, megakaryocytes, and
platelets, as well as on stem cells and early bone

increased platelet production

figure 2
the tpo receptor has been proposed to exist as an inactive preformed dimer (left) with a proximal
(hrd-1) and distal (hrd-2) hematopoietic receptor domain. upon binding of tpo or romiplostim to the
distal hrd-2 or binding of  xxxd1982xxx  to the transmembrane region, the receptor conformation changes
(right) and a number of signal transduction pathways are activated that increase platelet production.

marrow progenitor cells of all lineages. tpo
affects late maturation only of megakaryocytes
and platelets but is required to maintain the viability of stem cells and precursors of all lineages.
when the genes for tpo or its receptor are
knocked out in mice, the number of megakaryocyte precursors, megakaryocytes, and platelets
drops to ∼10% of normal; progenitors of red
and white blood cells decrease to 20%–30%
of normal, but with no reduction in the white
blood count (wbc) or red blood count (rbc)
(11). in human infants born with a defective
tpo receptor (12) or adults who develop an
antibody to tpo (13, 14), thrombocytopenia
is an initial problem, but pancytopenia ensues
after several years, presumably due to the requirement of tpo for stem cell viability.
like epo receptors (15), tpo receptors
probably exist as preformed but inactive dimers
(figure 2). each tpo receptor has two repetitive hematopoietic receptor domains (hrds).
it is speculated that the two distal hrds of the
preformed tpo receptor dimer sterically interact to prevent receptor activation, since loss
of the distal but not the proximal hrd creates
a constitutively activated receptor (16). upon
binding of one tpo molecule, the positions

of the distal hrd are altered and the receptor
dimer is activated (for reviews see references
17–20).
tpo production is regulated by a mechanism different from that for epo production.
there is no “sensor” of the platelet count and no
change in the transcription, translation, or release of tpo from its hepatic site of production
(3). rather, tpo is constitutively produced (reduced only in liver disease), has no storage form,
enters the circulation, and is cleared by avid
tpo receptors on platelets—and probably to a
lesser degree by those on megakaryocytes (21,
22). when platelet production is reduced, the
clearance of tpo is reduced, circulating levels
rise, and stimulation of megakaryocyte precursors increases. with increased platelet production, the circulating platelet count rises, more
tpo is cleared, and balance is restored (3).

thrombopoietins
soon after the discovery of tpo, two recombinant tpos entered clinical development
(figure 1). one, rhtpo, closely resembled native tpo and was produced in chinese hamster

ovary cells. the other, peg-rhumgdf, consisted of the amino-terminal 163 residues of
human tpo, was not glycosylated, and had a
30-kd  xxxd2982xxx  (peg) moiety attached to keep the molecule stable in the circulation. both of these recombinant molecules
had circulatory half-lives of 40 h.
subsequent studies in humans demonstrated
the platelet count response to the administration of a single dose of either recombinant
tpo: a ﬁve-day lag time (presumably due to
tpo stimulation of early megakaryocyte progenitors, but not late megakaryocytes) before
rising, peak platelet count at day 12–14, a loglinear dose-response curve, a return to baseline
by day 28, and no rebound thrombocytopenia
(23, 24).

clinical lessons learned
from studies with the
first-generation
thrombopoietins
many clinical studies with both recombinant
tpos were conducted between 1995 and 1999.
the ﬁnal reports from many of these studies
have never been published, but most of the unpublished results have been discussed in prior
reviews (see references 17–19).
in studies of patients undergoing
chemotherapy for lung cancer, fanucchi
et al. showed that peg-rhumgdf elevated
the nadir platelet count from about 100 ×
109 /l to 200 × 109 /l (23). but because the
modest dose intensity chemotherapy rarely
produced severe thrombocytopenia, there was
no effect on the use of rbc or platelet transfusions. however, vadhan-raj et al. showed
that patients undergoing chemotherapy with a
high-auc-dose platinum-based chemotherapy regimen did have a >50% reduction in
their need for platelet transfusion (24% in
the rhtpo-treated group versus 77% in the
placebo-treated group) as well as a higher
nadir platelet count (52 × 109 /l versus 24 ×
109 /l) (25).
in stem cell transplantation, neither recombinant tpo showed any clinical beneﬁt in re196

kuter

ducing the need for platelet transfusions or the
time to platelet recovery to >20 × 109 /l when
given daily after reinfusion of stem cells into
conditioned recipients. furthermore, although
both tpos were effective in increasing the
yield of cd34+ cells when used to mobilize
stem cells (4.1 × 106 /kg in rhtpo-treateddonors versus 0.8 × 106 /kg in placebo-treated
donors), this did not translate into a major clinical beneﬁt upon transplantation (26).
similarly, when given after acute myeloid
leukemia (aml) induction or consolidation
chemotherapy, there was no reduction in the
duration of thrombocytopenia or need for
platelet transfusions (27). a possible reason for
the failure of tpo to beneﬁt either stem cell
transplant or aml chemotherapy patients may
be the already high endogenous tpo levels in
these patients.
small studies in immune thrombocytopenic
purpura (itp) and myelodysplastic syndrome
(mds) did show some potential beneﬁt of recombinant tpo treatment. platelet counts rose
dramatically in 3 of 4 japanese itp patients
who had received seven daily treatments with
peg-rhumgdf (28). in a group of 21 mds
patients who received peg-rhumgdf daily
for 14 days, the median platelet count doubled
(15.7 × 109 /l to 30.8 × 109 /l) (29).
in platelet apheresis donors, administration
of a single 3-mug/kg dose of peg-rhumgdf
increased the median platelet count from
252 × 109 /l to 599 × 109 /l 14 days later (30).
platelet apheresis yields rose from 3.7 × 1011 /l
to 11.2 × 1011 /l. the increased amounts
of platelets collected from peg-rhumgdftreated donors showed normal function in vitro
and were hemostatically active when transfused
into thrombocytopenic recipients (31).
these encouraging studies were followed by
a very large safety study in which healthy human volunteers were given a single monthly
dose of peg-rhumgdf or placebo for up
to three months (13). but 13 of 535 subjects
who received peg-rhumgdf (and none of
the 532 placebo-treated subjects) developed an
anti-tpo antibody and paradoxically dropped
their platelet counts to <100 × 109 /l, several

to 10–20 × 109 /l. all have since recovered, but
several did require treatment with cyclosporine
a or rituximab to eliminate the autoantibody
and normalize the platelet count (as well as the
wbc and rbc in two patients who developed
pancytopenia) (13, 14). additional analysis of
650 cancer chemotherapy patients treated with
peg-rhumgdf identiﬁed at least four who
also developed thrombocytopenia, believed to
be due to auto-antibody formation. no subject treated with rhtpo developed neutralizing antibodies. however, clinical development of both recombinant tpos was ultimately
discontinued.
further analysis of the 13 thrombocytopenic
subjects demonstrated that they had developed an igg4 antibody to peg-rhumgdf
that cross-reacted with endogenous tpo and
neutralized its activity, thereby reducing the
megakaryocyte population, and eventually reducing other lineages as well. subsequent studies have suggested that it was not the difference
in structure of peg-rhumgdf versus rhtpo
that accounted for the production of autoantibody. rather, it was the route of administration; rhtpo was given intravenously but
peg-rhumgdf was given subcutaneously.
tpo is a potent stimulus for dendritic cells
when given subcutaneously (32). rats developed extensive antibody formation and thrombocytopenia when injected subcutaneously,
but not intravenously, with peg-rratmgdf
(17, 19).

second-generation
thrombopoietins
results of clinical trials with the ﬁrstgeneration tpos were sufﬁciently encouraging to prompt a search for nonimmunogenic
tpos. development of this second generation
of tpos also included improvements in pharmacology and mode of delivery. three general
classes of second-generation tpos were developed: tpo peptide mimetics, tpo nonpeptide
mimetics, and tpo antibody mimetics. each
class has a unique structure and a unique mode
of activation of the tpo receptor. only one

tpo peptide mimetic (romiplostim) and one
tpo nonpeptide mimetic ( xxxd1982xxx ) have
been extensively studied, and only these are discussed in detail below.

tpo peptide mimetics
in 1997, a 14–amino acid peptide having no
sequence homology with tpo was identiﬁed
that bound and activated the tpo receptor
(33). since any tpo has to simultaneously bind
two tpo receptor molecules, it was found that
dimerization of this peptide increased its speciﬁc activity 10,000-fold and produced a tpo
mimetic as active as rhtpo in tissue culture.
unfortunately, the short circulatory half-life
of peptides usually makes them poor pharmacologic agents. efforts were then directed toward stabilizing the peptide, and yet preserving
a dimeric structure, by (a) pegylation [pegtpo mimetic peptide (34)], (b) incorporation
into the complementarity-determining region
of immunoglobulin carrier molecules [fab59
(35)], or (c) attachment to a modiﬁed fc receptor [romiplostim (36)]. all of these tpo peptide mimetics bind to the distal hrd of the
tpo receptor and activate the receptor just like
recombinant tpo (figure 2).
romiplostim (nplate)
initially named
amgen megakaryopoiesis protein-2 (amp-2),
and subsequently developed as amg-531,
romiplostim is a 60-kda structure composed
of four tpo mimetic peptides attached by
glycine bridges to a novel igg heavy-chain fc
region (a “peptibody”), again creating a dimeric
molecule capable of activating the tpo receptor (figure 3) (36). the peptides have no
sequence homology with endogenous tpo,
so if antibodies formed against romiplostim,
they would not cross-react with endogenous
tpo. romiplostim has a circulatory half-life
of 120–160 h and is initially removed by the
endothelial fcrn receptors, recycled, and eventually cleared by the reticuloendothelial system
(37).
in healthy human volunteers, single doses of
romiplostim produced a dose-dependent rise in

occur. romiplostim is available as a lyophilized
powder that is reconstituted with sterile water and usually injected subcutaneously once a
week at doses of 1–10 mug/kg (37).

tpo nonpeptide mimetics
screening libraries of chemical constructs to
identify structures that activate the tpo receptor has yielded a large number of “lead compounds” (38, 39). further modiﬁcation of such
compounds to improve their biological activity and pharmacological properties has resulted
in at least three that have entered human clini198

kuter

they are all small (400–900 da) chemical structures that are orally administered,
usually once a day.
they have very precise binding to the
tpo receptor and bind only to tpo receptors in humans and chimpanzees (43).
this has prevented preclinical efﬁcacy
studies in animal models.
this species speciﬁcity is attributed to
what amino acid is present at position
499 in the tpo receptor transmembrane
region: histidine in humans and chimps,
leucine in all other species.
they appear to activate the tpo receptor
by binding not to the distal hrd, as tpo
does, but to the transmembrane region
(figure 2). this makes their biological
effect at least additive to that of tpo.

as well as differing in structure and pharmacological attributes, the three tpo nonpeptide mimetics differ greatly in their ability to
increase the platelet count in healthy volunteers at maximally tested doses.  xxxd1982xxx 
increased the platelet count ∼1.5-fold above
baseline, lgd-4665 increased it 1.8-fold, and
akr-501 increased it 2.3-fold (versus sixfold
for romiplostim).
 xxxd1982xxx  previously known as sb497115,
 xxxd1982xxx  (figure 4) is available as 25-,
50- or 75-mg tablets and is administered orally
daily. since food and divalent cations affect absorption, recipients should not eat food 2 h
before or after ingesting  xxxd1982xxx , and
medications with divalent cations (e.g., antacids
or calcium) should not be taken. single doses
have no effect on the platelet count, but daily
doses for 10 days produce a peak platelet count
on day 16 in healthy human volunteers (40).

most of the studies are early phase i/ii studies
with minimal data available.

molecule with an acidic (cooh) group at one end,
lipophilic (ch3 ) groups at the other end, and a
metal chelate group in the center.

general, monoclonal antibodies have impressively long half-lives but are sterically hindered
in their ability to bind to cytokine receptors.
however, modiﬁcations of size or structure can
produce an effective ligand for the tpo receptor. one of these, tpo minibody [vb22b
sc(fv)2], is composed of a dimerized part of the
fab (fragment antigen binding) region and has
been shown to increase the platelet count in
monkeys (44). another is ma01g4344, a monoclonal antibody in which the fc portion and
the upper hinge region have been modiﬁed (45),
which increases the platelet count for more than
a month in mice. neither of these antibody constructs has been tested in humans, and they are
not discussed further in this review.

clinical studies with
second-generation
thrombopoietins
the second-generation tpos are being studied in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, hepatitis c–related thrombocytopenia,
itp, and mds. except for the work on itp,

studies in nonmyeloablative chemotherapy
have been initiated with both romiplostim and
 xxxd1982xxx , but no results have been released. however, this reviewer is concerned
that some of the oral tpo nonpeptide mimetics may not have sufﬁcient potency to be effective. studies with the ﬁrst-generation tpo
molecules suggested that, in order to be effective in nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, higher
doses were required than those needed to elevate platelet counts in healthy subjects.

hepatitis c–related
thrombocytopenia
the thrombocytopenia associated with chronic
hepatitis c infection is due to decreased hepatic production of tpo as well as an itplike increased rate of platelet destruction (46).
because a platelet count below 70 × 109 /l is
thought to limit effective antiviral treatment,
a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial
was conducted to compare  xxxd1982xxx  versus placebo in hepatitis c patients with platelet
counts below 70 × 109 /l (47). when 75 mg
was given daily for 4 weeks, the median platelet
count rose from 55 × 109 /l to 209 × 109 /l;
all subjects rose to >100 × 109 /l. placebotreated subjects showed no increase in platelet
count and none increased to >100 × 109 /l.
four of 18 placebo patients and 21 of 23  xxxd1982xxx  patients then began antiviral treatment and remained on their assigned treatment
(placebo or  xxxd1982xxx ) for 12 more weeks.
fifteen of 23  xxxd1982xxx  patients (65%) completed antiviral treatment, but only 1 of 18
placebo patients (6%).

immune thrombocytopenic purpura
although itp has long been known to be a
disease of increased platelet destruction (48),

recent studies have shown that it is also a disease
of inappropriately low platelet production (49–
51). platelet production is normal or reduced in
>75% of itp patients (49) and tpo levels are
usually normal (52). one explanation for this is
that the antiplatelet antibody (and possibly cytotoxic bone marrow lymphocytes) reduces the
proliferation of megakaryocyte precursors and
causes megakaryocyte apoptosis (50, 51). since
tpo can promote the viability of megakaryocyte precursors and megakaryocytes, it was hypothesized that tpo treatment might enhance
platelet production and increase the platelet
count (19). this hypothesis now appears to be
correct.
phase i–iii studies have been completed
with romiplostim and  xxxd1982xxx . both increase the platelet count in >80% of itp patients. in all studies, patients were required to
have a platelet count of 30 × 109 /l or less and
to have failed a prior itp therapy; both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients were
studied. response to therapy was deﬁned as a
rise in platelet count to >50 × 109 /l and, for
romiplostim studies, a platelet count double the
baseline value.

200 × 109 /l. rescue therapy (intravenous immune globulin, anti-d immune globulin, increased steroid dose, platelet transfusion) was
allowed if patients developed symptomatic
bleeding. investigators reported that 79%
(33/42) of splenectomized and 88% (36/41) of
nonsplenectomized patients had their platelet
count rise to ≥50 × 109 /l during four or more
weeks of the 24-week study compared to 0%
(0/21) and 14% (3/21) of the respective placebo
groups ( p < 0.001). the responses were of signiﬁcant duration in that during the 24 weeks
of study, a platelet count ≥50 × 109 was attained during 12.3 weeks for splenectomized
subjects and 15.2 weeks for nonsplenectomized
subjects, versus 0.2 and 1.3 weeks, respectively, for the placebo subjects ( p < 0.001).
the use of rescue medication was markedly
reduced: 22% for romiplostim-treated versus
60% for placebo-treated patients ( p < 0.001)
in the combined studies. romiplostim allowed
more subjects who had been on concomitant
steroids to reduce or discontinue these medications. all of the splenectomized subjects in
the romiplostim group were able to reduce or
stop steroid treatment, compared to 17% of
the placebo group. among nonsplenectomized
subjects, 73% of the romiplostim group versus
50% of the placebo group reduced or discontinued steroids.
subjects from the above phase i–iii studies
were allowed to enroll in an open-label extension study of romiplostim with doses adjusted
weekly depending on the platelet count. interim analysis of 142 subjects treated for up to
156 weeks showed platelet responses (platelet
count ≥50 × 109 /l and double baseline) in
87% of all patients. responses occurred on
average 67% of the time in responding patients (54). seventy-seven percent of subjects
remained on a stable dose and 63% performed
home injection. bleeding events were reduced
(55).
romiplostim was in general well tolerated,
with mild headache on the day of injection

being the most common complaint (1.8 events
per 100 patient-weeks) followed by contusion
(1.1 events per 100 patient-weeks) and epistaxis (1.0 events per 100 patient-weeks). uncommon events of potential interest (increased
bone marrow reticulin, “rebound” thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism) are discussed
in more detail below.
 xxxd1982xxx  studies in a phase i/ii study,
118 adults with itp and platelet counts below 30 × 109 /l were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd1982xxx  (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or
placebo daily for 6 weeks (56). in the  xxxd1982xxx  groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg per
day, a platelet count ≥50 × 109 /l was achieved
in 28%, 70%, and 81% of patients, respectively. in the placebo group, this was achieved
in 11% of patients. the median platelet counts
on day 43 for the groups receiving 30, 50, and
75 mg of  xxxd1982xxx  were 26 × 109 /l, 128 ×
109 /l, and 183 × 109 /l, respectively; for the
placebo group the count was 16 × 109 /l. by
day 15, >80% of patients receiving 50 or 75 mg
of  xxxd1982xxx  daily had an increased platelet
count. upon stopping the drug, platelet counts
returned to their prior low baseline value.
patients enrolled in the six-week study were
eligible to enter a long-term, open-label extension study with  xxxd1982xxx . the drug was administered orally daily to target a platelet count
of 50–200 × 109 /l, and concurrent itp medications (e.g., corticosteroids) could be tapered.
interim analysis of 89 evaluable subjects with a
treatment duration of 151 days showed that of
the 61 subjects with a baseline platelet count below 30 × 109 /l, 43 (73%) achieved a platelet
count of >50 × 109 /l (57). most were able
to maintain this platelet count elevation and
showed a trend toward fewer bleeding events.
a large phase iii study comparing  xxxd1982xxx  with placebo daily for six months has
been completed, but the results are not yet
available.
 xxxd1982xxx  was associated with minor
adverse events (e.g., headaches in 20%) and was
well tolerated. in the placebo-controlled study,
there were no differences in adverse event rates

between placebo- and  xxxd1982xxx -treated
patients.

myelodysplastic syndromes
thrombocytopenia is a common ﬁnding in
patients with all forms of mds. modest responses to the ﬁrst-generation tpos prompted
studies with the second-generation tpos in
mds. in one preliminary report, 28 subjects
with low-risk mds and platelet counts lower
than 50 × 109 /l (median baseline count =
25 × 109 /l) received four weekly doses of
romiplostim (58). seventeen (61%) responded
(platelet count rose to ≥50 × 109 /l), with the
median platelet count rising to 125 × 109 /l.
eleven (39%) maintained the response for
more than eight weeks. studies continue in untreated mds patients and in those undergoing
chemotherapy.

potential complications
of  xxxg2282xxx 
treatment
human exposure to both romiplostim and  xxxd1982xxx  has been limited. no more than 600
subjects have been exposed to treatment, and
the maximum reported duration of exposure has
been 156 weeks for romiplostim and 151 days
for  xxxd1982xxx . in placebo-controlled studies,
short-term exposure risks have been minimal
after 24 weeks of romiplostim and six weeks of
 xxxd1982xxx . mild headache, ecchymoses, and
epistaxis were noted, all mild.
because these drugs may be used for a prolonged time in itp patients, attention must be
paid to potential, albeit uncommon, long-term
risks of exposure. to date, the following issues
have been identiﬁed:


reduced platelet activation threshold. none
of the recombinant tpos or tpo
mimetics directly activates platelets.
however, all recombinant tpos and
tpo peptide mimetics, but none of
the tpo nonpeptide mimetics, reduce
the threshold for platelet activation by

50% (59). this is unlikely to provoke
thrombosis because the ﬁrst-generation
tpos were associated with no increased risk of thrombosis, even in cancer
patients.
“rebound” thrombocytopenia. in the phase
i/ii studies with romiplostim, treatment
was stopped after six weeks. because tpo
mimetics do not affect the rate of platelet
destruction in itp, the platelet count fell
in almost all patients. however, the posttreatment platelet count transiently fell
by >10 × 109 /l below the prior baseline in 4 of 56 patients. all four returned
to their prior baseline within four weeks,
but two subjects required rescue therapy
(36). this may be due to a treatmentrelated expansion of the megakaryocyte
pool and consequent transient increased
clearance of endogenous tpo upon cessation of pharmacological doses of tpo.
thromboembolic complications. recent
studies have suggested that itp (and/or
its treatment) creates a prothrombotic
state and an increased risk for arterial
and venous thromboembolism, possibly
due to the large number of new (and
active) platelets being formed. arterial
and venous thromboembolic events have
been reported for patients treated with
both romiplostim and  xxxd1982xxx , but
in the placebo-controlled itp studies
they were no more frequent than in the
placebo groups. most of the patients
with thromboembolic events were of
older age and had pre-existing risks for
thrombosis.
increased bone marrow reticulin. bone marrow reticulin (identiﬁed by silver stain) is
a normal component of the bone marrow
that may be increased in patients with autoimmune disorders. this increase is reversible (for review see reference 60). it is
distinct from collagen ﬁbrosis (identiﬁed
by trichrome stain), which is usually associated with myeloproliferative disorders
or tumors metastatic to bone marrow and
is usually not reversible. although bone



marrow examination was not routinely
performed in the itp studies, of 205 subjects treated with romiplostim (most of
whom did not undergo bone marrow examination), reticulin was reported in 11
(55). staining intensity was within the
normal range in 6; one showed a small
area of collagen ﬁbrosis. none showed
any evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder. of 117 itp patients exposed to  xxxd1982xxx , 19 had bone marrow examinations (after a median of 13 months of
treatment) and seven showed ﬁbrosis (5
reticulin and 2 collagen). increased reticulin is a well-described (and reversible)
effect of tpo. prolonged administration
of large doses of romiplostim to mice produced marrow ﬁbrosis that was reversible
within four weeks of stopping the drug.
eight of 9 aml patients treated with
rhtpo developed increased bone marrow reticulin, versus only 2 of 6 who received placebo; upon discontinuation of
rhtpo, the reticulin disappeared within
an average of 30 days (range: 13–42 days).
increased blast count. this has been seen
only in a few mds patients treated with
romiplostim in studies with no placebo
group. whether this reﬂects the natural history of mds or is a treatment effect is unclear. however, in aml patients
treated with ﬁrst-generation tpos, there
was no increase of blasts or change in remission rates (19).

conclusions
two tpo mimetics, romiplostim and  xxxd1982xxx , are now available for second-line
treatment of both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized itp patients. because the
long-term adverse effects of these drugs are not
yet fully known, access to these drugs will initially be restricted to patients with itp. this is
unfortunate, since a large number of short-term
thrombocytopenic conditions exist where the
risks of short-term exposure (under six months)
are well known and acceptable. these disorders

include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, hepatitis c–related thrombocytopenia, liver failure
patients awaiting liver transplantation, mild
(30–50 × 109 /l) thrombocytopenia in presurgical patients, and chemotherapy-induced
thrombocytopenia. routine platelet apheresis
donors might beneﬁt from tpo mimetics
as well. short-term exposure might also be
appropriate for itp patients being prepared
for splenectomy, or pediatric itp patients (in

whom the duration of disease is usually less
than six months). post-marketing surveillance
of itp patients treated with these drugs as well
as new studies in a number of other thrombocytopenic conditions should allow a clearer
understanding of the beneﬁts and risks of tpo
mimetics. however, given the ﬁve-day lag time
for a platelet effect, they are not a substitute for
platelet transfusions in the acute treatment of
thrombocytopenia.
