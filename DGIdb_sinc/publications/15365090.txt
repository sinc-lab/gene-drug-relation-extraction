abstract
 xxxd2215xxx , a potent  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) cl⫺ channel blocker, is frequently used to
study function and regulation of cftr cl⫺ channels. in this study,
the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on intracellular na⫹ concentration
([na⫹]i), contraction, ca2⫹ transient, and membrane potential
were investigated in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes.
 xxxd2215xxx  increased [na⫹]i and decreased contraction and
ca2⫹ transient. however,  xxxd2215xxx  did not change membrane potential. to determine whether inhibition of na⫹-k⫹
pumps and l-type ca2⫹ channels is responsible for the increase
of [na⫹]i and the decrease of contraction, we tested the effects of
 xxxd2215xxx  on na⫹-k⫹ pump current and l-type ca2⫹ current

maintenance of a low intracellular na⫹ concentration
([na⫹]i) and a large transmembrane na⫹ gradient is important for electrophysiological functions of a variety of tissues
including cardiac muscles. the low [na⫹]i and large transmembrane na⫹ gradient are maintained by na⫹-k⫹ pumps
(glitsch, 2001). changes in the transmembrane na⫹ gradient could affect the action potential, intracellular ph, ca2⫹
sensitivity of myofilaments, intracellular ca2⫹ concentration
([ca2⫹]i), electrical conduction, and the contractile force of
heart cells (lee, 1981; levi et al., 1997). besides, the influx of
ca2⫹ ions through l-type ca2⫹ channels plays an essential
role in cardiac excitability and in excitation-contraction coupling (ferrier and howlett, 2001). the depolarizing current
contributes to the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential. therefore, it is important to understand the pharmacol-

(ica,l).  xxxd2215xxx  decreased na⫹-k⫹ pump current and ica,l
in a concentration-dependent manner. in the presence of cl⫺
channel inhibitors,  xxxd2215xxx  depolarized diastolic membrane
potential and reduced action potential duration. this result suggests that the reason for lack of effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on membrane potential might be due to its combined inhibitory effects on
the na⫹-k⫹ pump, the l-type ca2⫹ channel, and cl⫺ channels,
which may have opposing effects on membrane potential. these
results indicate that  xxxd2215xxx  increases [na⫹]i by inhibiting
the na⫹-k⫹ pump and decreases contraction and ca2⫹ transient,
in addition, by blocking the l-type ca2⫹ channel.

ogy of the na⫹-k⫹ pumps and the l-type ca2⫹ channels in
the cardiac muscle.
 xxxd2215xxx  (glib), a potent  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) cl⫺ channel blocker, is
an anion with large hydrophobic components (sheppard and
robinson, 1997; hume et al., 2000; gupta and linsdell,
2002). it is frequently used to study regulation of the cftr
cl⫺ channel (yamamoto-mizuma et al., 2004) and cftr cl⫺
channel pore (gupta and linsdell, 2002; zhou et al., 2002).
however, several studies have revealed that  xxxd2215xxx ,
in addition to blocking the cftr cl⫺ channels, also inhibits
atp-sensitive k⫹ channels (ashcroft and gribble, 2000), human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) channels (rosati et
al., 1998), transient outward k⫹ currents (hernandez-benito
et al., 2001), swelling-activated cl⫺ channels (hume et al.,
2000), and ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ channels (hume et al., 2000)
in cardiac myocytes.
despite a large number of studies examining the effect of
 xxxd2215xxx  on cardiac channels, there have been very few
studies that looked at the effect of the drug on [na⫹]i, contraction, ca2⫹ transient, and membrane potential in cardiac
muscle. thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on [na⫹]i, contraction,
ca2⫹ transient, and membrane potential in guinea pig ven-

tricular myocytes. our study indicates that  xxxd2215xxx 
increases [na⫹]i by inhibiting the na⫹-k⫹ pump and decreases contraction and ca2⫹ transient by blocking the ltype ca2⫹ channel. however,  xxxd2215xxx  does not change
diastolic membrane potential and action potential duration.

materials and methods
cell isolation
to get single ventricular myocytes, guinea pigs (300 –500 g) were
anesthetized with pentobarbital (⬃50 mg/kg i.p.), and then their
hearts were removed. the heart was enzymatically dissociated into
single myocytes by using a method previously described (lee and
levi, 1991). the isolated myocytes were kept at room temperature
(20 –23°c) until they were used (within 8 –10 h). experiments were
performed in accordance with the national ethical guidelines as
described previously (gadsby and nakao, 1989).

electrical recording
myocytes in the experimental chamber were continuously superfused at ⬃37°c with tyrode’s solution containing 140 mm nacl, 4.4
mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, and 10 mm
glucose (ph 7.4 with naoh).
measurement of membrane potential. to measure membrane
potential, we used conventional microelectrodes pulled from filamented thin-wall glass (tw150f-6, 1.5-mm o.d.; world precision
instruments, inc., sarasota, fl). they were filled with 300 mm kcl
and had a resistance between 25 and 40 m⍀. the electrode resistance and capacitance were compensated to about to 90% of their
initial value. microelectrode potential was measured with an axoclamp 2a amplifier (0.1-gain head stage; axon instruments inc.,
union city, ca). action potentials were elicited at 0.5 hz by 2-ms
depolarizing current pulse passed down the microelectrode.
voltage-clamp procedure with conventional microelectrodes. to record the l-type ca2⫹ current (ica,l), the voltage-clamp
procedure was performed using the amplifier’s discontinuous switchclamp mode with conventional microelectrodes filled with 300 mm
kcl and 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (tea-cl) and having
about 20 m⍀ tip resistance. the electrode resistance and capacitance
were compensated to about to 90% of their initial value. the i-v
relationship of peak ica,l was constructed using 500-ms voltage
pulses to the potentials of 10-mv increment between ⫺40 mv and
⫹40 mv from the holding potential of ⫺40 mv (to inactivate the na⫹
current). tea-cl (5.4 mm) was added to the tyrode’s solution to
block k⫹ currents. voltage-clamp protocol and data acquisition were
performed with an axoclamp 2a amplifier, an analog-to-digital converter (ced 1401; cambridge electronic design, cambridge, uk),
and the software wcp (written by john dempster of strathclyde
university, glasgow, scotland, uk).
the biophysical properties of ica,l were then analyzed in n-methyl-d-glucamine-containing solutions to efficiently isolate ica,l from
the contamination of other currents (na⫹, k⫹, na⫹-ca2⫹ exchanger).
after obtaining the whole-cell configuration, myocytes were perfused
with an extracellular na⫹- and k⫹-free ica,l solution: 144 mm nmethyl-d-glucamine-cl, 5.4 mm cscl, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.8 mm cacl2,
and 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4). patch pipettes (1–2 m⍀) contained 120
mm cscl, 20 mm tea-cl, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 5 mm egta, 5 mm
mg-atp, 0.2 mm gtp, and 10 mm hepes (ph 7.3 with csoh). the
use of these solutions allowed recording of stable ica,l currents with
minimal rundown (bett et al., 2002). myocytes were voltage clamped
to a holding potential of ⫺70 mv. the steady-state inactivation and
activation relationships were determined using a gapped doublepulse protocol once every 2 s; a 500-ms prepulse to potentials between ⫺60 and ⫹70 mv was followed by a 10-ms return to the
holding potential and then a fixed 500-ms test pulse to ⫹10 mv.
whole-cell recording. to measure the na⫹-k⫹ pump current,
whole-cell currents were recorded via wide-tipped pipettes with re-

sistance of about 1 m⍀ as described (gadsby and nakao, 1989). the
pipette-to-bath liquid junction potential was small (⫺3.5 mv) and
was uncorrected. membrane capacitance (the time integral of the
capacitive response to a 10-mv hyperpolarizing pulse from a holding
potential of 0 mv, divided by the voltage drop) averaged 131.5 ⫾ 24.5
pf (n ⫽ 10). the holding potential was set to 0 mv to inactivate na⫹
and ca2⫹ channels. whole-cell currents were recorded in response to
50-ms voltage pulses to potentials from ⫺100 to ⫹40 mv in 20-mv
steps. the steady-state current was plotted against the test potential. all patch-clamp protocol and data acquisition were performed
with an axopatch-200a amplifier, an analog-to-digital converter
(digidata1200; axon instruments inc.), and the software pclamp 5
(axon instruments inc.). the modified ca2⫹-free tyrode’s solution
used in the whole-cell current-recording experiments contained: 145
mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 2 mm bacl2, 1 cdcl2, 5.5 mm
glucose, and 5 mm hepes (ph 7.4 with naoh). the pipette solution
contained: 50 mm naoh, ⬃76 mm csoh, 90 mm  xxxd233xxx , 20
mm tea-cl, 3 mm mgcl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm egta, 10 mm
mg-atp, 5 mm tris-creatine phosphate, 5 mm  xxxd3055xxx , 10 mm
hepes, and 4 mm cacl2 (for free ca2⫹ 50 nm) (ph 7.3 with csoh).

simultaneous measurement of intracellular naⴙ or ca2ⴙ
and contraction
to measure [na⫹]i or [ca2⫹]i and contraction simultaneously,
myocytes were loaded with the fluorescent na⫹-sensitive indicator
sbfi-am or fluorescent ca2⫹-sensitive indicator fura-2-am as described previously (lee and levi, 1991; woo and lee, 1999). myocytes loaded with the indicator were then moved to the experimental
chamber and illuminated with ultraviolet light (75-w xenon lamp)
applied via an epifluorescence microscope. a filter wheel in front of
the uv light was rotated continuously at 20 hz (for sbfi) or 75 hz
(for fura-2), and excitation filters of 340 and 380 nm were selected
alternatively (cairn research, kent, uk). the ratio of the light
emitted at 340-nm excitation to that emitted at 380-nm excitation
(the 340:380 ratio) is a direct index of the level of intracellular
sodium or calcium. after an experiment, in situ calibration of the
[na⫹]i was performed as described by lee and levi (1991). at the
same time, contraction was measured optically with a video edge
detector system (crescent electronics, windsor, on, canada) that
has been previously described (steadman et al., 1988).

chemicals and statistics
sbfi-am and fura-2-am were obtained from molecular probes
(eugene, or). all other chemicals including  xxxd2215xxx  were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).  xxxd2215xxx  was prepared as 0.1 or 0.2 m stock solution in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso).
the maximum concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  applied was 500 ␮m,
which was the maximum concentration (tominaga et al., 1995).
 xxxd188xxx  ( xxxd188xxx ),  xxxd2723xxx  (nfa), and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)- xxxd306xxx  ( xxxg1585xxx ) were prepared in
dmso as a stock solution so that the desired final concentration was
achieved by 1:1000 dilution with the external control solution. the
final concentration of dmso did not exceed 0.3%, which had no effect
under the conditions of our experiments.
all data are presented as means ⫾ s.e.m., and statistical differences were determined by paired student’s t tests. numerical data
were analyzed with sigmaplot 2001 for windows (spss inc., chicago, il) and origin 6.1 (originlab corp., northampton, ma). differences were considered statistically significant at p ⬍ 0.05.

application of 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  decreased ca2⫹ transient by 22.0 ⫾ 0.8% (n ⫽ 9, p ⬍ 0.05) and contraction by
44.8 ⫾ 2.4% (n ⫽ 21, p ⬍ 0.01), respectively. after washing
off  xxxd2215xxx , both ca2⫹ transient and contraction were
recovered to the control level. figure 2c shows the concentration-response curves for the decrease in contraction and
ca2⫹ transient caused by  xxxd2215xxx . the decreases in
contraction and ca2⫹ transient by  xxxd2215xxx  were fitted
by the hill function (1⫹(ic50/[glib])p)⫺1, and the hill numbers were 0.6 ⫾ 0.3 and 0.4 ⫾ 0.3 for contraction and ca2⫹
transient, respectively.  xxxd2215xxx  decreased contraction
and ca2⫹ transient at concentrations ⬎ 1 ␮m.
to examine the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2⫹
load in the  xxxd2215xxx -induced reduction in magnitude of
ca2⫹ transient and  xxxd2215xxx -induced increase in diastolic ca2⫹ levels, sr ca2⫹ content was assessed by caffeineinduced ca2⫹ transient. after steady-state sr ca2⫹ load was
achieved, application of 20 mm caffeine at the end diastole
resulted in a large [ca2⫹]i increase due to sr ca2⫹ release.
figure 3 shows no significant differences in caffeine-sensitive
sr ca2⫹ stores before and during the exposure to  xxxd2215xxx . results also show that  xxxd2215xxx  did not significantly increase diastolic ca2⫹ levels (from 0.44 ⫾ 0.02 to
0.46 ⫾ 0.02, n ⫽ 11; fig. 3b). these results indicate that
decrease in contraction by  xxxd2215xxx  is due to reduction
of the magnitude of ca2⫹ transient without change in sr
ca2⫹ content.

effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on naⴙ-kⴙ pumps. to determine whether the inhibition of na⫹-k⫹ pumps was responsible for the increase in [na⫹]i, we tested the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on na⫹-k⫹ pump current. figure 4a illustrates
the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on the na⫹-k⫹ pump current in a
ventricular myocyte. na⫹-k⫹ pump current was estimated
as cardiac steroid-sensitive current (gadsby and nakao,
1989). we used 0.5 mm strophanthidin (stro), a cardiac steroid, as an inhibitor of na⫹-k⫹ pump. strophanthidin-sensitive currents represent the difference between the membrane
currents in the presence and absence of strophanthidin.
na⫹-k⫹ pump current was decreased 43.8 ⫾ 3.0% (n ⫽ 8, p ⬍
0.05) by 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  at 0 mv membrane potential.
after washing off  xxxd2215xxx  and strophanthidin, the
na⫹-k⫹ pump current was almost recovered to the control
level. the membrane currents (fig. 4a, bottom) recorded at
the times indicated by corresponding numbers show steady
state. figure 4b shows normalized plots of the steady-state
membrane current (i) against membrane voltage (v). the
steady-state levels of whole-cell current determined before
(fig. 4a, 1 and 3) and during (fig. 4a, 2 and 4) the applications of strophanthidin. figure 4c shows the average strophanthidin-sensitive i-v relationships obtained by subtracting steady-state current levels in strophanthidin from those
determined just before exposure to strophanthidin.  xxxd2215xxx  reduced strophanthidin-sensitive current at all voltages (n ⫽ 5).
figure 5 shows the relation between the decrease of
na⫹-k⫹ pump current and the concentration of  xxxd2215xxx . as concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  increased, the
na⫹-k⫹ pump current decreased. the na⫹-k⫹ pump current

effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on l-type ca2ⴙ channels.
to determine whether inhibition of l-type ca2⫹ channels
was responsible for the decrease of contraction, we tested
effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on ica,l. figure 6a shows the time
course of change in ica,l when  xxxd2215xxx  was applied.
application of 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  decreased ica,l and the
decreased ica,l recovered to the control level after washing
off  xxxd2215xxx . in six myocytes tested, 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  decreased peak ica,l by 33.1 ⫾ 4.0% (p ⬍ 0.01) at
0-mv membrane potential. figure 6b represents the average
ica,l-v relationship in the absence and presence of 200 ␮m
 xxxd2215xxx . the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on kinetics and
steady-state activation and inactivation of ica,l were then
examined.  xxxd2215xxx  did not show significant effects on
the macroscopic biexponential inactivation kinetics of ica,l
recorded at 0 mv (fig. 6c). mean values (n ⫽ 6 myocytes)
were as follows: ␶1, control 8.9 ⫾ 1.0 ms,  xxxd2215xxx  10.5 ⫾

and methods) and curve fit by boltzmann equations as follows: i/imax ⫽
1/[1 ⫹ exp(v ⫺ vh)/k], where vh is the half-maximum inactivation potential and k is the slope factor for f⬁, and g/gmax ⫽ 1/{1 ⫹ exp[ ⫺ (v ⫺
vh)/k]}, where vh is the half-maximum activation potential for d⬁, g is
conductance, and gmax is maximal conductance. data represent mean
value ⫾ s.e.m. from four to six experiments.

13.9 ms. to determine whether change in voltage dependence
of steady-state activation and inactivation of ica,l was involved in the decrease of ica,l, effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on the
steady-state activation (d⬁) and inactivation (f⬁) relationship
was determined using a gapped double-pulse protocol in
na⫹- and k⫹-free solutions. figure 6d shows that  xxxd2215xxx  caused a 12-mv hyperpolarizing shift in holding
potential (vh) of f⬁ (from ⫺22.9 ⫾ 4.6 mv, n ⫽ 5, in control,
to ⫺34.7 ⫾ 1.3 mv, n ⫽ 4, p ⬍ 0.01) without a significant
change in the slope factor (k; control, 7.6 ⫾ 3.9 mv;  xxxd2215xxx , 5.0 ⫾ 1.1 mv). results also show that  xxxd2215xxx 
did not cause a significant change in vh of d⬁ (from ⫺16.5 ⫾
1.8 mv, n ⫽ 6, in control, to ⫺20.4 ⫾ 1.5 mv, n ⫽ 6) and in
k values (control, 7.6 ⫾ 3.9 mv;  xxxd2215xxx , 5.0 ⫾ 1.1 mv).
the  xxxd2215xxx -induced hyperpolarizing shift in f⬁ could
account for the reduced ica,l.
figure 7 shows the concentration dependence of  xxxd2215xxx ’s effect on ica,l. in the concentration range tested,
inhibition of ica,l by  xxxd2215xxx  was dependent on the
concentration of  xxxd2215xxx . decrease in ica,l was observed concentration greater than 1 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx . the
maximum concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  applied was 500
␮m, which was the maximum concentration used in our
study. the decrease in ica,l by  xxxd2215xxx  was fitted by
the hill function (1⫹(ic50/[glib])p)⫺1, and hill number p was
0.7 ⫾ 0.3.
effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on membrane potential in
the presence of clⴚ channel inhibitors. our results
revealed that  xxxd2215xxx  had lack of effect on the membrane potential (fig. 1c). however, it is well recognized that
inhibition of the na⫹-k⫹ pump and the l-type ca2⫹ channel
reduces apd (lee and levi, 1991; qu et al., 1993).  xxxd2215xxx  also blocks several kinds of cl⫺ channels (yamazaki
and hume, 1997). activation of cftr cl⫺ channels and
swelling-activated cl⫺ channels has a significant effect on
membrane potential (hume et al., 2000). inhibition of the
cftr cl⫺ channels and swelling-activated cl⫺ channels
could lengthen the apd and hyperpolarize the diastolic
membrane potential. therefore, it is possible that  xxxd2215xxx  might have lengthened the apd by inhibition of the
cl⫺ channels and shortened it by inhibitions of the na⫹-k⫹
pumps and the l-type ca2⫹ channels, which together might
result in no change in diastolic membrane potentials and
apd.

effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on apd in the presence of cl⫺ channel
inhibitors, nfa,  xxxg1585xxx , and  xxxd188xxx . all of these compounds,

depolarization by  xxxd2215xxx  in the presence of cl⫺ channel inhibitor is small. the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on resting
membrane potential and apd in the presence of nfa,  xxxg1585xxx ,
 xxxd188xxx , and dmso were summarized in fig. 8, c and d. therefore, the results suggest that  xxxd2215xxx  lengthened the
apd by inhibition of cl⫺ channels and shortened it by inhibition of na⫹-k⫹ pumps and l-type ca2⫹ channels, which
together might result in no change in diastolic membrane
potentials and apd.

discussion
in the present study, we report that  xxxd2215xxx  increases [na⫹]i, decreases contraction and ca2⫹ transient but
does not alter diastolic membrane potential and apd in
isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. furthermore, it
was revealed that the increase of [na⫹]i was caused by inhibition of the na⫹-k⫹ pumps and that the decrease of contraction and ca2⫹ transient were due to blockage of the
l-type ca2⫹ channels. the reason for the lack of effect on
membrane potential by  xxxd2215xxx  might be due to its
combined inhibitory effects on the na⫹-k⫹ pump, the l-type
ca2⫹ channel, and cl⫺ channels, which may have opposing
effects on membrane potential.
effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on naⴙ-kⴙ pumps. maintenance of a low [na⫹]i is important for electrophysiological
functions of cardiac muscle. changes in [na⫹]i can affect the
[ca2⫹]i, the contractile force, action potential, and intracellular ph of heart cells (lee and levi, 1991; levi et al., 1997).
the increase of [na⫹]i induced by  xxxd2215xxx  is considered
to be an indirect evidence of inhibition of the na⫹-k⫹ pump.
we tested the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on the na⫹-k⫹ pump
current that provides direct evidence.  xxxd2215xxx  decreased the na⫹-k⫹ pump current in a concentration-dependent manner (figs. 3 and 4), which strongly supports that
 xxxd2215xxx  increased [na⫹]i via inhibition of the na⫹-k⫹
pump.
the rise of [na⫹]i leads to increases in [ca2⫹]i via na⫹ca2⫹ exchange (lee and levi, 1991; levi et al., 1997). in the
present study, however,  xxxd2215xxx  increased [na⫹]i, but
it decreased ca2⫹ transient and contraction of ventricular
myocytes (figs. 1 and 2). the decrease of contraction could be
due to the decrease of l-type ca2⫹ current by  xxxd2215xxx ,
which reduced [ca2⫹]i. we propose that the reduction in
ca2⫹ transient, despite the increase in na⫹-ca2⫹ exchange
activity, is partially explained by that the reduction of
[ca2⫹]i exceeds the increase of [ca2⫹]i via the na⫹-ca2⫹
exchange.
inhibition of the na⫹-k⫹ pump depolarizes diastolic membrane potential and shortens apd of the myocytes because
the na⫹-k⫹ pump is electrogenic (lee and levi, 1991;
glitsch, 2001), and increased [na⫹]i produces outward current via the na⫹-ca2⫹ exchange (levi et al., 1997). however,
it was reported that 100 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  had no effect on
apd in anesthetized guinea pig (chen et al., 2000), and 1 to
10 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  did not alter apd significantly in rat
and rabbit heart (smallwood et al., 1990; doggrell and
bishop, 1996; light et al., 1999). similarly, our study shows
that  xxxd2215xxx  produced no change in apd of the myocytes (fig. 1).
the well known effect of  xxxd2215xxx  is inhibition of
atp-sensitive k⫹ channels in various types of cell and or-

 xxxd2215xxx , naⴙ-kⴙ pump, and l-type ca2ⴙ channel

gans (ashcroft and gribble, 2000). however, the atp-sensitive k⫹ channel is closed by atp with half-maximal closure
at 20 to 100 ␮m of atp in heart. normal physiological intracellular atp concentration is in the range of 5 to 10 mm
(nichols and lederer, 1991; grover and garlid, 2000). actually, in our experiments, there was no significant difference
in  xxxd2215xxx ’s effect on membrane potential between no
atp and 20 mm atp in the pipette solution of the microelectrode having 12 to 15 m⍀ tip resistance (data not shown).
therefore, the contribution of atp-sensitive k⫹ channels to
 xxxd2215xxx ’s effect on membrane potential could be ruled
out.  xxxd2215xxx  is also known to block several kinds of
cl⫺ channels (yamazaki and hume, 1997). inhibition of cl⫺
channels only, especially cftr cl⫺ channels and swellingactivated cl⫺ channels, could lead to an increase in apd
(hume et al., 2000). actually, application of  xxxd188xxx  increased
the apd (data not shown). when cl⫺ channels were inhibited by several kinds of cl⫺ channel inhibitors,  xxxd2215xxx 
reduced the apd (fig. 7), suggesting that inhibition of the
na⫹-k⫹ pump and the l-type ca2⫹ channel by  xxxd2215xxx 
decreased the apd. thus, our findings suggest that the reason for the lack of effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on apd might be
due to its dual inhibitory effects in which apd prolongation
by inhibition of cl⫺ channels offsets apd shortening by inhibition of na⫹-k⫹ pump and l-type ca2⫹ channel.
rosati et al. (1998) reported that 100 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx 
prolonged apd by about 9.4%. they suggested that the increase of apd resulted from the inhibition of the herg
channels. they applied  xxxd2215xxx  for 30 s, which was too
short to induce any changes in [na⫹]i, contraction, ca2⫹
transient, and membrane potential in our experiment. we
applied  xxxd2215xxx  at least for 2 min to wait for the
stabilization of that effect. the lack of effect on apd by
 xxxd2215xxx  was might be interpreted by its opposing inhibitory effects on the na⫹-k⫹ pump, the l-type ca2⫹ channel, and cl⫺ channels. nevertheless, it is possible that inhibition of the herg channels caused by  xxxd2215xxx  could
partially contribute to the no change in apd by cooperating
with the cl⫺ channels against the na⫹-k⫹ pump and the
l-type ca2⫹ channel.
effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on l-type ca2ⴙ channels.
l-type ca2⫹ channels play an essential role in cardiac excitability and in e-c coupling. depolarizing current through
l-type ca2⫹ channels contributes to the plateau phase of the
cardiac action potential, and it is well known that ica,l triggers calcium release from sr, which induces twitch force
(ferrier and howlett, 2001).
the strength of contraction can be changed by altering the
amplitude or duration of the ca2⫹ transient and by altering
the sensitivity of myofilaments to ca2⫹ (bers, 2002).  xxxd2215xxx  decreased the magnitude of ca2⫹ transient, which
reduced contraction (fig. 2). sulfonylureas including  xxxd2215xxx  have not been reported to change the sensitivity of
myofilaments to ca2⫹. also, our study shows no evidence
that  xxxd2215xxx  might change the sensitivity of the contractile proteins.
 xxxd2215xxx ’s effect on the l-type ca2⫹ channels is tissue-specific (bian and hermsmeyer, 1994; kim et al., 1997;
ashcroft and gribble, 2000). in pancreatic ␤ cells, 0.2 to 1 ␮m
 xxxd2215xxx  inhibits atp-sensitive k⫹ channels, which in
turn produces depolarization of the membrane and opening
of the voltage-gated ca2⫹ channel. the resulting ca2⫹ influx

67

leads to insulin secretion (luzi and pozza, 1997; ashcroft and
gribble, 1999, 2000). similarly, it was reported that 10 to 100
␮m  xxxd2215xxx  activated the voltage-dependent ca2⫹
channel by depolarizing membrane potential and regulated
secretion of mechanically activated atrial natriuretic peptide
in atrial cells (kim et al., 1997). in the present study with
ventricular myocytes, 10 to 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited
the ica,l and reduced the contraction. however,  xxxd2215xxx  did not cause change in transmembrane potential of
the myocytes (fig. 1). similar inhibitory effect of 10 to 100
␮m  xxxd2215xxx  on the ica,l was also observed in rat aortic
smooth muscle (yoshitake et al., 1991; bian and hermsmeyer, 1994).
some investigators did not observe a negative inotropic
effect of  xxxd2215xxx  in the heart (sykes et al., 1977; del
valle et al., 2001). they applied  xxxd2215xxx  via oral administration or intravenous injection, and the concentration
of  xxxd2215xxx  in plasma might be around 0.5 to 2.5 ␮m
(del valle et al., 2001). our results also revealed that  xxxd2215xxx  had no significant effect on contraction at concentrations ⬍ 1 ␮m, and the threshold concentration for the
effect was between 1 and 10 ␮m (fig. 2).
 xxxd2215xxx  and cftr clⴚ channel. cardiac cftr
cl⫺ channels have been demonstrated to play a role in action
potential shortening during hypoxia and ischemia, thereby
limiting intracellular ca2⫹ overload and cell damage (hume
et al., 2000). recent evidence suggests a potential role of the
cftr cl⫺ channel in ischemic preconditioning (chen et al.,
2004). therefore, it is important to characterize cftr cl⫺
channel inhibitors as probes of cftr cl⫺ function.  xxxd2215xxx  is widely used to study the cftr cl⫺ channel because it is relatively potent among cftr cl⫺ channel inhibitors (sorota, 1999). however, several studies reported that
 xxxd2215xxx , in addition to blocking the cftr cl⫺ channels, also inhibits atp-sensitive k⫹ channels (ashcroft and
gribble, 2000), herg channels (rosati et al., 1998), transient outward k⫹ currents (hernandez-benito et al., 2001),
swelling-activated cl⫺ channels (hume et al., 2000), and
ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ channels (hume et al., 2000) in cardiac
myocytes. in our study,  xxxd2215xxx  also inhibited the
na⫹-k⫹ pump and the l-type ca2⫹ channel. recently,
muanprasat et al. (2004) reported a new compound, glycine
 xxxd2396xxx . the ic50 values of  xxxd2215xxx  and glycine  xxxd2396xxx  for cftr cl⫺ channel are 11 to 12.5 ␮m (yamazaki
and hume, 1997) and 1.4 to 5.6 ␮m (muanprasat et al.,
2004), respectively. the glycine  xxxd2396xxx  also has high water solubility and rapidity of action (muanprasat et al., 2004).
this compound may be useful to examine the function and
regulation of the cftr cl⫺ channel.
