a b s t r a c t
the discovery of genetic drivers of lung cancer in patient sub-groups has led to their use as predictive
biomarkers and as targets for selective drug therapy. some of the most important lung cancer drivers
are mutations in the egfr gene, for example, the exon 19 deletions and the l858r variant that confer sensitivity to the front line drugs  xxxd2029xxx  and gefitinib; the acquired t790m variants confer drug resistance
and a poor prognosis. a challenge then in targeting egfr is to produce drugs that inhibit both sensitising
variants and resistance variants, leaving wild type protein in healthy cells unaffected. one such agent is
astrazeneca’s ‘‘breakthrough”  xxxd2797xxx  molecule that shows a 200-fold selectivity for t790m/l858r over
wild type egfr. our x-ray crystal structure reveals the binding mode of  xxxd2797xxx  to the kinase domain of
wild type egfr.

1. introduction
lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is
a highly, and rapidly fatal disease. one of the recent concepts to
emerge around lung cancer has been the discovery of genetic drivers in patient sub-groups that can be used clinically as both predictive biomarkers and molecular targets for targeted cancer
therapy, for example, egfr somatic mutations (cancer genome
atlas research network, 2014; ding et al., 2008; huang et al.,
2004; kosaka et al., 2004; lynch et al., 2004; paez et al., 2004;
pao et al., 2004). subsequent to this, a series of randomized clinical
trials showed certain patients harboring  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) mutations experienced dramatic therapeutic
response to egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (maemondo et al.,
2010; mitsudomi et al., 2010; mok et al., 2009; rosell et al.,
2012; zhou et al., 2011). a wide range of different egfr gene mutations are now associated with the development of lung cancer predominantly in never or former smokers, by activating the egfr
kinase, causing oncogenic transformation (shigematsu et al.,
2005; yun et al., 2007; zhang et al., 2006), but also importantly,

conferring sensitivity to  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition. the two most
common egfr mutations are deletions around the lrea motif of
exon 19, and the exon 21 l858r point mutation; both instances
show sensitivity to the atp competitive first generation egfr inhi-

2009). there is a clear need for drugs in the clinician’s arsenal that
will target egfr kinase harboring the t790m mutation and tkisensitizing mutations while leaving the wild type protein uninhibited in non-cancerous cells.
an irreversible egfr kinase inhibitor,  xxxd2797xxx , has recently
been developed by astrazeneca (cross et al., 2014; finlay et al.,
2014) that belongs to a novel class of compounds including  xxxd582xxx  and  xxxd3138xxx , which are selective for t790m and egfr tkisensitizing mutations over wild type protein.  xxxd2797xxx  (fig. 1)
shows 200-fold selectivity for t790m/l858r protein over wild
type, and has been classed a ‘‘breakthrough” compound for fast
track development having demonstrated a 64% objective response
rate in t790m-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients that
have progressed on a first generation  xxxd1256xxx  (janne et al.,
2014); it is currently in phase 3 trials. to understand the molecular
basis of this compound’s selectivity, we sought to produce crystal
structures to show its binding interaction to t790m, t790m/
l8587r, and wild type egfr kinase protein. our initial efforts have
produced a wild type structure by soaking the  xxxd2797xxx  molecule
into preformed crystals of egfr kinase.
2. protein production and structure determination
wild type egfr protein was synthesized (genscript) and cloned
into the pfastbac htb plasmid using hindiii and ncoi restriction
sites. baculovirus for wild type protein production were created
using the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa), and were used to infect sf9 cells. infected sf9
cells were harvested 72 h after infection by centrifugation at
600g for 6 min. the cell pellet was resuspended in tbs buffer
(25 mm tris ph 8.0, 137 mm nacl), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at 80 °c for later use.
cell pellets were supplemented with 10 ml of lysis buffer
(25 mm tris.hcl, ph 8.0, 0.5% v/v np-40 alt, 3 lm  xxxg1963xxx ) for
every 12–15 g of wet cell mass, and were agitated gently to com-

plete cell lysis. after lysis, the sample was supplemented with glycerol to a 5% final concentration and the nacl content was adjusted
to a final concentration of 150 mm. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min in an ss34 rotor, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45 lm filter (millipore) before
being loaded onto an equilibrated (buffer a: 25 mm tris.hcl, ph
8.0, 150 mm nacl, 15 mm imidazole and 5% glycerol) immobilised
metal affinity chromatography column (imac) (hitrap imac ff, ge
healthcare life sciences).
the immobilised protein was washed with buffer a and eluted
using a linear gradient of buffer b (25 mm tris.hcl ph 8.0, 150 mm
nacl, 200 mm imidazole and 5% glycerol). the protein containing
fractions were pooled and dialysed overnight at 4 °c in dialysis
buffer comprising 25 mm tris ph 8.0, 25 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt
and 5% glycerol, and supplemented with recombinant tobacco etch
virus protease for cleavage of the 6his-tag. the protein was subsequently passed over an imac column to remove 6his-tag and
uncleaved protein. the cleaved protein was collected and loaded
on an anion exchange column (hitrap q ff, ge healthcare life
sciences) pre-equilibrated with qf buffer a (25 mm tris.hcl ph
8.0, 25 mm nacl, 2 mm bme, 5% glycerol). the protein was eluted
using a linear gradient of qf buffer b (buffer a with 1 m nacl).
protein containing fractions from anion exchange were pooled
and buffer exchanged into storage buffer (25 mm tris.hcl, ph
8.0, 150 mm nacl, and 5% glycerol). protein was concentrated to
approximately 10 mg/ml and was either supplemented to 15%
glycerol and stored at 20 °c or was used immediately without
added glycerol for crystallisation experiments.
egfr kinase was crystallised using a hanging drop vapour diffusion method by mixing 1 ll protein with 1 ll crystallisation solution comprising 0.1 m mes, 1 m sodium citrate and inverting the
drop over 500 ll of the same crystallisation solution. hexagonalshaped crystals grew overnight and reached maximum size within
one week. an unliganded crystal was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, cryoprotected with a 70:30 mixture of paratone nò and minerals oils. data were collected at the australian synchrotron
beamline mx1 using the blu-ice software (mcphillips et al.,
2002). we were unable to co-crystallise the protein with
 xxxd2797xxx  and so instead resorted to soaking experiments. another
unliganded crystal was soaked overnight in a solution comprising
95% crystallisation buffer supplemented with 5%  xxxd2797xxx  dissolved in 100% dmso – the final concentration of  xxxd2797xxx  in
the soak solution was 5 mm. the crystal was cryoprotected in oil,
flash frozen, and data were collected on a rigaku micromax 007
hf rotating anode instrument. data were processed using xds,
pointless, and aimless (evans and murshudov, 2013; kabsch,
2010). both unliganded and  xxxd2797xxx  structures were solved by
molecular replacement using phaser and the pdb coordinates
2itx. structures were refined using refmac with ligands and water
molecules added to the model using coot (emsley et al., 2010;
murshudov et al., 2011). the  xxxd2797xxx  molecule could be fitted
unambiguously into difference electron density in a single orientation and conformation (fig. 2). the quality of the final  xxxd2797xxx /
egfr structure at 2.8 å, and the unliganded structure at 1.9 å,
was assessed using the molprobity and pdb validation servers
(chen et al., 2010). all data collection and refinement statistics
are outlined in table 1.

the crystal structure of the  xxxd2797xxx /egfr kinase complex
reveals a binding mode similar to the hypothetical model produced
by cross et al. (2014), and with the kinase domain in an active conformation (fig. 3). the  xxxd2797xxx  and unliganded structures are
very similar overall with an rmsd between 277 overlaid ca atoms

ability of  xxxd2797xxx  to covalently modify wild type egfr kinase

kinase domain was mixed with a 50% molar excess of  xxxd2797xxx 
and incubated for 3 h in crystallisation buffer before analysis by
the university of auckland, auckland science analytical services
mass spectrometry facility by lc–ms (qstar xl, applied biosystems). the mass spectrometry results (supporting information
fig. s1) show definitively that wild type protein is covalently modified by  xxxd2797xxx . what then does our crystal structure inform us
about the selectivity of  xxxd2797xxx  for different variants of egfr?
in the crystal structure  xxxd2797xxx  binds on the outer edge of the
atp-binding pocket sandwiched between the p-loop and the protein backbone between pro 794 and cys 797. two hydrogen bonds
help to anchor the ligand in place;  xxxd2797xxx  n4 hydrogen bonds to
the hinge atom met 793 n and the ligand carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to cys 797 n. the single hydrogen bond to the hinge
region is in contrast to the two bonds seen for  xxxd582xxx , a compound that shares the same central core structure and from which
 xxxd2797xxx  was designed (zhou et al., 2009).
the substituted phenyl ring of  xxxd2797xxx  makes a number of van
der waals interactions with the protein backbone below. extensive
interactions with non-polar residues from above complete the
sandwiching effect; leu 718 contacts the  xxxd2797xxx  phenyl ring,
ala 743 contacts the pyrimidine ring, val 726 and phe 723 contact
the indole ring. the protein backbone of leu 718–gly 719 also
forms van der waals interactions with the edge of the indole ring.
a comparison with our own unliganded egfr structure shows that
on  xxxd2797xxx  binding the only changes induced are in the tip of the
p-loop, specifically residues ser 720, gly 721, ala 722, phe 723, and
gly 724, previously disordered and thus unmodelled, now form a
stable and ‘‘bent” structure with the phe 723 side chain located
underneath the p-loop, making a 3.7 å contact with  xxxd2797xxx . it
has been observed that significant selectivity for a particular protein kinase can be achieved through the ability of the p-loop to
form a closed or bent structure and also importantly, to contact
the ligand through the side chain of the terminal p-loop phe or
tyr residue – as we see in our structure (dar et al., 2008;
deininger et al., 2005; guimarães et al., 2011; hari et al., 2013;
seeliger et al., 2009; yosaatmadja et al., 2015). while this observation may explain some degree of selectivity for the egfr tyrosine
kinase it does not explain the pattern of selectivity for egfr
mutants observed in the cell-based and clinical data.

4. molecular modelling probing inactive vs active egfr
conformations
without a crystal structure of  xxxd2797xxx  bound to the t790m/
l858r egfr kinase domain we have instead modelled this interaction using relevant crystal structures where the p-loop is found in a
more closed conformation which would ‘‘push” the  xxxd2797xxx 
molecule closer to the reactive cysteine 797. two structures were
used; the complex of t790m egfr with  xxxd1799xxx  (pdb id
4i24) that displays a p-loop conformation most like that within
our structure, and also a more relevant variant structure, t790m/
l858r in complex with the irreversible inhibitor  xxxd1070xxx  (pdb
id 4ll0). in both cases molecular docking (gold v1.7, ccdc) produced binding models by including soft potentials for gly 796
and cys 797 to allow the close approach of the inhibitor to cys
797 to mimic covalent attachment.
the modelled t790m (4i24) structure displays an inactive conformation in which the n-terminal and c-terminal lobes of the protein are brought closer together than in the equivalent active
conformation (gajiwala et al., 2013). in our model the p-loop has
moved downwards and we have simultaneously maintained,
through the inclusion of distance restraints in the modelling protocol, both appropriate van der waals contact distances from the
non-polar side chains to the top of the inhibitor and the
 xxxd2797xxx  n4 hydrogen bond to the hinge region (fig. 4). the loop
movement and conserved interactions in turn ‘‘push”  xxxd2797xxx 
towards cys 797 such that the c9 atom closely approaches the sulfur atom to a distance of 2 å – modelled as a covalent bond in
fig. 4. our model also suggests that additional ionic interactions
potentially form between  xxxd2797xxx  atom n2 (presumably protonated at physiological ph) and the protein side chains asp 800
and glu 804 that approach the ligand nitrogen to distances of
3.2 å.

fig. 4. hypothetical model of  xxxd2797xxx  binding to t790m egfr kinase using the
crystal structure of t790m egfr complexed with irreversible inhibitor  xxxd1799xxx 
as a template (pdb code 4i24). bold arrows show qualitatively the movement of the
p-loop we have modelled. the crystal structure ligand location is drawn in thick
black lines while the modelled location of  xxxd2797xxx  is drawn as a white stick model
– a modelled hydrogen bond is shown as a thin, black, dashed line. a covalent bond
(thick hashed line) is modelled to cys 797 and the amine side chain of  xxxd2797xxx  is
shown modelled as approaching asp 800 and glu 804 (not shown) where an ionic
bond might form. drawn with pymol (schrödinger).

does  xxxd2797xxx  binding parallel that of  xxxd1799xxx  and select
for an inactive conformation of the protein?  xxxd1799xxx , like
 xxxd2797xxx , does not form a covalent bond when soaked into wild
type crystals with egfr presumably locked by crystal packing in
an active protein conformation. irreversible  xxxd1799xxx  behaviour
required co-crystallisation with t790m egfr protein – the crystal
structure in this case displaying an unusual inactive conformation
(gajiwala et al., 2013). the authors suggest that  xxxd1799xxx  selectivity for t790m egfr and similar variants, is derived from the
lower conformational stability of these proteins relative to wild
type, basically, their propensity to sample various conformational
states including inactive conformations (gajiwala et al., 2013). is
this the same case for  xxxd2797xxx  binding in particular for the
t790m/l858r variant?
to probe this hypothesis we modelled  xxxd2797xxx  into the closed
p-loop, active
conformation of the t790m/l858r complex structure
with  xxxd1070xxx  by brewer et al. (pdb id 4ll0; brewer et al., 2013).
brewer describes evidence both crystallographic and from patient
derived material from lung cancer tissues, that the double mutant
protein preferentially conforms to an active state more so than the
wild type. does this suggest that  xxxd2797xxx  targets an active egfr
kinase domain conformation? certainly our model derived from
the  xxxd1070xxx  structure (produced in the same way as our 4i24based model) suggests that  xxxd2797xxx  can bind this active conformation again with a closed p-loop promoting the close approach
of the reactive centres of the inhibitor and protein. the most obvious difference in this model compared to our crystal structure is
that the tip of the p-loop is extended away from the inhibitor
and the terminal phe residue extends towards solvent space. we
contend that the reconfiguration of the p-loop tip that we observe
in crystalo
to a bent conformation with phe 723 pointing into the
active site, is an important and conserved feature of  xxxd2797xxx 
binding that may impact on the exact conformation of the egfr
kinase domain that is favoured whether inactive, active or some
other atypical arrangement.
our crystal structure and molecular modelling suggest that
direct contact with either of the mutated amino acids, t790m
(fig. 4) or l858r, has no bearing on the  xxxd2797xxx  binding mode
but instead these mutations only influence protein conformation
and molecular dynamics. this contrasts with the proposed selectivity mechanism of the  xxxd2797xxx  ‘‘parent” molecule  xxxd582xxx .
 xxxd582xxx  is related to  xxxd2797xxx  by the common central core structure but most obviously differs in having the alkylating functionality on the opposite end of the molecule. for  xxxd582xxx , alkylation of
egfr in an active conformation crystal structure is apparent, and
selectivity here is proposed through the contact between the inhibitor chloride substituent and the methionine of the t790m protein – we predict no equivalent interaction with the gatekeeper
methionine in the  xxxd2797xxx  system.
we have revealed the reversible binding mode of  xxxd2797xxx  to
wild type egfr protein and have probed by molecular modelling,
hypothetical binding modes to inactive and active conformations
of the egfr kinase domain. our hypotheses and the questions arising from our structure warrant further investigation and many
answers will no doubt be provided by the future determination
of crystal structures of t790m and t790m/l858r egfr complexes
with  xxxd2797xxx .
