preparation of antiserum against rat delta6-desaturase and its use to evaluate the desaturase protein levels in rats treated with gemfibrozil, a li...  anti-rat delta6-desaturase serum was produced by immunizing rabbits with the 14 n-terminal amino acids (2-15) of rat delta6-desaturase. the antiserum prevented the enzymatic activity of delta6-desaturase in microsomes. subsequently, the antiserum was used to demonstrate that gemfibrozil, a ligand for  xxxg1805xxx , is involved in activating delta6-desaturase gene expression, thereby elevating the protein level and the activity.
