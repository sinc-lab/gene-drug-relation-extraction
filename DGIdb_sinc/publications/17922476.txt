summary
most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will eventually require insulin
therapy to achieve or maintain adequate glycaemic control. the introduction
of insulin analogues, with pharmacokinetics that more closely mimic
endogenous insulin secretion, has made physiologic insulin replacement
easier to achieve for many patients. however, there are also concerns
regarding alteration of binding affinities for the  xxxg1194xxx  (ir) or
insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) may increase the mitogenic
potential of some analogues. therefore, this article will review the relevant
preclinical and clinical data to assess the mitogenic potential of insulin
 xxxd2362xxx , a basal insulin analogue, compared with regular  xxxd2364xxx 
(rhi).
searches of the pubmed database were performed using terms that included
‘ir,’ ‘insulin-like growth factor-1,’ ‘ xxxg1145xxx ,’ ‘type 2 diabetes mellitus,’ and
‘ xxxd2362xxx .’ original articles and reviews of published literature were
retrieved and reviewed.
although one study reported increased binding affinity of  xxxd2362xxx 
for the  xxxg1145xxx  and increased mitogenic potential in cells with excess igf-1rs
(saos/b10 osteosarcoma cells), most in vitro binding-affinity and cell-culture
studies have demonstrated behaviour of  xxxd2362xxx  comparable to that
of rhi for both ir and  xxxg1145xxx  binding, insulin signalling, and metabolic and
mitogenic potential.
currently published in vivo carcinogenic studies and human clinical trial
data have shown that  xxxd2362xxx  is not associated with increased risk
for either cancer or the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.

the benefits of early, intensive glycaemic control with insulin in patients
with type 2 diabetes have been clearly demonstrated in the united kingdom
prospective diabetes study (ukpds) in two large clinical trials. in this
study, benefits included a 25% risk reduction for microvascular complications
in patients receiving insulin compared with those receiving conventional
treatment [1]. in a further analysis of the data from ukpds, each 1%
reduction in mean glycosylated hemoglobin a1c (a1c) level was associated
with a 21% reduction in risk for all diabetes-related endpoints (p < 0.0001),
a 37% risk reduction for microvascular complications (p < 0.0001), and a
14% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) [2].

most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually
require treatment with exogenous insulin to achieve or
maintain adequate glycaemic control. with the inevitable
progressive decline of beta-cell function, physiologic insulin
regimens may be needed to successfully reach glycaemic
goals [3]. the introduction of insulin analogues, which
were designed to provide onset and duration of action that
more closely mimic endogenous insulin secretion, have
made physiologic insulin replacement easier to achieve
for many patients [3,4].
 xxxd2362xxx , a widely used basal insulin analogue,
is characterized by the addition of two arginine molecules
at the c-terminal region of the insulin b chain (position
b30), and the substitution of glycine for asparagine in the
a chain (position a21) [4]. these modifications to the
 xxxd2364xxx  molecule result in a less soluble analogue
that precipitates in subcutaneous tissue, allowing for
prolonged absorption with little peak activity [4,5]. given
once daily,  xxxd2362xxx  replaces endogenous basal
insulin secretion. this agent can be added to oral antihyperglycaemic therapy to achieve glycaemic targets in
patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing inadequate
glycaemic control with oral anti-diabetic agents alone
[6,7]. for patients, whose a1c remains above target after
the addition of basal insulin therapy, rapid-acting insulin
analogues (i.e. insulin aspart, lispro, or glulisine) given at
one or more meals each day can be added to the regimen
to control elevations in postprandial glucose levels [4].
although there are advantages to using insulin
analogues rather than regular  xxxd2364xxx  (rhi) to
provide more physiological insulin replacement, there
are also potential concerns. insulin analogues have often
altered receptor-binding affinities for the  xxxg1194xxx 
(ir), and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ). although composed of a single chain, the insulin-like
growth factor-1 (igf-1) molecule has both a and b
domains, with 45–50% homology to the a and b chains
of the insulin molecule; the two receptors (ir and  xxxg1145xxx ) also show substantial structural homology to each
other [8]. the receptor-signalling pathways activated by
insulin/igf-1 binding to their receptors are responsible
for both metabolic regulation and mitogenic responses
(i.e. cell growth and differentiation) [9,10].
insulin analogues may therefore have increased
mitogenic potential, either through altered affinity (as
measured by dissociation rates) for the  xxxg1145xxx  and/or
increased half-life of the insulin-ir complex [8,9]. for
example, the insulin analogue aspb10 (not in clinical
use) has a three-fold higher affinity for ir and  xxxg1145xxx  and
threefold higher in vitro metabolic activity, compared with
rhi [11]. aspb10 has a ten- to twenty-fold higher in vitro
mitogenic effect, with demonstrated dose-dependent
mitogenic activity in female rats treated for 1 year with
supraphysiologic doses (range: 12.5–200 u/kg/d) [11].
for these reasons, it is important to evaluate the mitogenic
potential of any insulin analogue because of the likelihood
of its long-term use in the treatment of diabetes. this
article will review the relevant pre-clinical and clinical

data to assess the mitogenic potential of  xxxd2362xxx 
compared with rhi.

a brief review of insulin and  xxxg1145xxx 
signalling
insulin signalling is characterized by a series of complex,
highly interconnected pathways that form a network
regulating important metabolic and mitogenic processes
(figure 1) [10]. the ir and  xxxg1145xxx  are both tetrameric
proteins with two extracellular alpha-subunits and two
intracellular beta-subunits. each tetramer is formed from
two alpha –beta dimers linked with disulfide bonds, and hybrid
ir/ xxxg1145xxx  complexes can also be formed [10]. however,
in human coronary artery endothelial cells expressing the
hybrid ir/ xxxg1145xxx , only igf-1 appears to phosphorylate
the hybrid receptor [12]. in rat vascular smooth muscle
cells expressing ir,  xxxg1145xxx , and hybrid receptors, only
igf-1 stimulated glucose metabolism and dna synthesis
at physiologic concentrations [13]. importantly, it is
also possible for insulin to bind to the  xxxg1145xxx  and
igf-1 to bind to the ir, albeit with significantly lower
affinities (indicated by the dashed arrows in figure 1).
both the ir and  xxxg1145xxx  are receptor tyrosine kinases,
which are activated by ligand binding and phosphorylate
downstream signalling components [10].
most of the metabolic effects of insulin are mediated via phosphorylation of  xxxg1194xxx  substrate
(irs) proteins. in turn, irs proteins activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt/protein-kinase b pathway,
leading ultimately to glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis,
and gluconeogenesis blockade. the other major effect is
activation of the ras-mitogen–activated protein-kinase
pathway, either through src-homology-2-containing proteins (shc) or irs proteins (phosphorylated by either
 xxxg1145xxx  or ir). this ras pathway regulates gene expression to control cell growth and differentiation [10].
although these pathways are interconnected, in vitro
evidence suggests that  xxxg1198xxx  is primarily responsible for
the metabolic effects of insulin, while shc largely mediates
the mitogenic effects. these differences between the two
pathways may explain the increased ratio of mitogenic
to metabolic potency seen with some insulin analogues
that bind to the ir with a longer half-life or slower
dissociation rates. this pathway differentiation results
in sustained phosphorylation of shc, but not of  xxxg1198xxx ,
which is dephosphorylated in a selective, time-dependent
manner by protein tyrosine phosphatases [9].

 xxxd2362xxx  and igf-1 signalling

figure 1. an overview of the insulin signalling network. insulin (blue arrows) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) (orange
arrows) bind to their respective receptors (ir and  xxxg1145xxx ) and initiate a series of interconnected signalling pathways that
lead to both metabolic (yellow pathways) and mitogenic (pink pathways) effects. the first critical node where these pathways
connect is through the group of ir substrate proteins ( xxxg1198xxx  through irs-4); from this point, most of the metabolic effects of
insulin/igf-1 occur through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and akt/protein-kinase b (akt1 through  xxxg120xxx )
pathways. modulators or downstream effectors of these pathways include cas-br-m (murine) ecotropic retroviral transforming
sequence homologue (cbl); cbl-associated protein (cap); ras homologue gene family member q (arhq, also called tc10);
atypical protein kinase c (apkc); akt substrate of 160 kda (as160); cell-division cycle 42 (cdc42); rac; phosphatase and
tensin homologue (pten); phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and 2 (pdk1 and 2); glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk3);
 xxxg812xxx  ( xxxg812xxx ); and mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor). activation of the ras pathway [through the irs
proteins or through the src-homology-2-containing protein (shc)] regulates genes that control cell growth and differentiation via
 xxxg1369xxx  and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx  and 2). signalling pathways that are activated by cytokines such as tumour
necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-6 (il-6), and leptin interfere with insulin signalling through crosstalk, mediated via
c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk), janus kinase (jak), signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat), and suppressor of
cytokine signalling (socs) [10]. reprinted with permission from taniguchi et al. critical nodes in signalling pathways: insights
into insulin action. nat rev mol cell biol 2006; 7: 85–95

study of rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human ir isoform
a or isoform b,  xxxd2362xxx  was similar to rhi with
respect to receptor association and dissociation, while the
analogue aspb10 showed delayed receptor dissociation
[14].  xxxd2362xxx  and rhi also showed similar rates
of receptor autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of  xxxg1198xxx / xxxg1199xxx  and shc, and incorporation of [3 h]thymidine
into dna (a measure of mitogenicity). in contrast,
aspb10 induced prolonged phosphorylation of irs and
shc molecules and increased the rate of [3 h]thymidine
incorporation [14].
the effects of  xxxd2362xxx  and rhi were also studied
in cultured human skeletal muscle cells (hsmcs), because
this tissue is a major site of glucose disposal and a key
site of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes
[15,16]. this study reported that  xxxd2362xxx  was
equivalent to rhi in its ability to compete for [125 i]insulin
binding to the ir, and induced comparable stimulation of
glucose uptake in cultured hsmcs from patients with and
without type 2 diabetes [15].

 xxxg1145xxx 
while  xxxd2362xxx  behaved comparably to rhi
with regard to ir binding in the studies described
previously, differences in binding to the  xxxg1145xxx 
have been reported (table 1). notably,  xxxd2362xxx 
showed increased affinity (approximately 6.5-fold) for
soluble igf-1rs in vitro (using purified, solubilized
human receptors) compared with rhi [17]. however,
binding affinities were equivalent and very low compared
with igf-1 when cell-based systems were used [15].
in the study of cultured hsmcs,  xxxd2362xxx 
did have a slightly higher affinity for  xxxg1145xxx  than
rhi, but only at supraphysiologic concentrations (i.e.
the highest concentration level tested, 200 nm; insulin
 xxxd2362xxx ’s physiologic concentration is 0.9–1.2 nm) [18];
furthermore, the affinity of  xxxd2362xxx  for  xxxg1145xxx 
was only 0.1% compared to 0.25% of that of igf-1
[15].

e binding curves showed that affinity of  xxxg1145xxx  for  xxxd2362xxx  was significantly higher than that for rhi only at the highest concentration level
tested [200 nm (p < 0.05)].

metabolic and mitogenic potential of
 xxxd2362xxx 
 xxxd2362xxx  has demonstrated metabolic potency
(measured as lipogenesis or glucose transport) comparable to that of rhi in several studies using different
cell lines [15,17,19]. freshly cultured hsmcs have the
unique advantage of mirroring the relative expression of
ir and  xxxg1145xxx  observed in skeletal muscle in vivo [15]. in
cultured hsmcs from individuals both with and without
type 2 diabetes, stimulation of glucose uptake for rhi and
 xxxd2362xxx  was similar [15].
table 2 summarizes the available data regarding
mitogenicity of  xxxd2362xxx  compared with rhi in
a variety of cell-culture systems. as shown, the mitogenic
potential of  xxxd2362xxx  was low relative to aspb10
or igf-1 and comparable to rhi in four of the five
cell lines tested [14,15,19,20]. the only exception was
the cell line saos/b10, a human osteosarcoma cell line
that overexpresses  xxxg1145xxx  [17]. in this cell line, insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  resulted in an approximately eight-fold increase
in 3 h-thymidine incorporation relative to rhi; however,
this response occurred at supraphysiologic concentrations
of  xxxd2362xxx . moreover, because of the 1000fold weaker affinity of  xxxd2362xxx  versus igf-1 for
the  xxxg1145xxx , it would be unlikely that  xxxd2362xxx 
would add significantly to the endogenous activity of
igf-1.
given the parallel increase in  xxxg1145xxx  affinity and
mitogenic potential of  xxxd2362xxx  in the saos/b10
osteosarcoma cell line, the data reviewed in this section
appear to support the importance of the  xxxg1145xxx  in
mediating mitogenic responses to rhi and/or insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  [17]. this study reported a lack of association
between ir dissociation rates and mitogenicity. in
addition, while it has been reported that insulininduced activation of the ras-mitogen-activated proteinkinase pathway can induce vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation and migration, animal and clinical studies

of type 2 diabetes indicate that insulin is anti-atherogenic
and induces increased myocardial blood flow in vivo
[21–24]. there is, however, evidence that mitogenic
responses can be elicited through the ir. as discussed
previously, insulin analogues with slower ir dissociation
rates (e.g. aspb10) show greater mitogenic potency than
rhi in chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human
ir, suggesting that the duration of ir occupancy may be
a primary component of ir–mediated mitogenesis [9]. in
the light of this possibility, it is important to note that
 xxxd2362xxx , while similar to rhi in its ir binding and
dissociation rates, does have a slightly lower ir affinity
and slightly faster dissociation rate compared with rhi
[14,15,17].

in vivo animal and human clinical data
on mitogenicity of  xxxd2362xxx 
the overall similarity of  xxxd2362xxx  to rhi in
receptor–binding studies, as well as the general lack
of increased mitogenic potential in most cell lines tested,
argue against any increased cancer risk associated with
 xxxd2362xxx  treatment in humans. despite increased
 xxxg1145xxx  binding and mitogenic potential of  xxxd2362xxx 
in the cell line b10, prior reports have indicated that
 xxxg1145xxx  affinity and/or in vitro mitogenicity (induction
of cell cycle progression) do not necessarily correlate
with increased in vivo tumour incidence (carcinogenicity)
[8]. indeed, the in vivo safety of  xxxd2362xxx  was
confirmed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice
and rats (table 3) [25].
in these studies, 100 mice (50 males and 50 females,
table 3a) or 100 rats (again, 50 males and 50 females,
table 3b) were given once-daily subcutaneous injections
of nacl control, vehicle control, increasing dosages of
 xxxd2362xxx  (2, 5, or 12.5 u/kg), or neutral protamine
hagedorn (nph) insulin (12.5 u/kg in mice or 5 u/kg
in rats) for 2 years. as shown in the tables, neither the

mice nor the rats demonstrated any significant increase in
the incidence of mammary tumours in those injected with
 xxxd2362xxx  versus vehicle or nph insulin [25]. while
male mice injected with low doses of  xxxd2362xxx 
did show slightly increased incidence of hepatocellular
tumours and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (mfh) at
injection sites compared with nacl control animals
(table 3a), these increases were not dose-dependent,
did not occur in female mice, and were also seen in
the vehicle control group. similarly, a higher incidence of
mfh at injection sites was seen in male rats at all dosages
of  xxxd2362xxx , as well as in the vehicle control group
(table 3b); this increase was not observed in female
rats. hepatocellular tumours (in mice) and mfh (in rats
or mice) are commonly seen in laboratory rodents and
are not considered relevant to humans [25]. thus, these
studies clearly demonstrated that  xxxd2362xxx  did
not cause in vivo mammary tumours or other neoplastic
changes relevant to humans.
igf-1 has been implicated in the development and
progression of retinopathy via promotion of neovascularization; in addition, patients with rapidly progressing
retinopathy have elevated levels of serum igf-1 [26].
therefore, a safety study also analysed the risk for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
treated with  xxxd2362xxx  in 4 phase 3 clinical trials
[27]. this analysis revealed no increased risk for either
the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy in
patients treated with  xxxd2362xxx  versus nph insulin.
in addition, the ukpds demonstrated a relationship
between elevated blood glucose levels and developing
retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes, and that
intensive glycaemic control with insulin decreased the
risk for retinopathy [1].
copyright  2007 john wiley & sons, ltd.

igf-1 synthesis is induced by growth hormone from the
pituitary gland with negative feedback from serum levels
of igf-1 [28]. to test whether  xxxd2362xxx  could
regulate serum levels of igf-1, a small, 3-week crossover
study (n = 42) examined igf-1 levels in patients with type
1 or type 2 diabetes using  xxxd2362xxx  or nph insulin
[29].  xxxd2362xxx  treatment was not associated with
a decrease in serum igf-1 levels, suggesting that insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  did not have biologically relevant igf-1–like
activity at the pituitary level.

conclusions
as a result of improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, insulin analogues provide clinical benefits
in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, allowing them to
more closely mirror the normal physiologic pattern of
endogenous insulin secretion compared with subcutaneous injection of rhi. however, alterations of the human
insulin molecule can result in possible altered binding
kinetics to the ir and  xxxg1145xxx . for example, asp(b10) has
been shown to produce sustained activation of the ir via
prolonged irs phosphorylation and shc molecules [14].
therefore, even years after their initial availability, it is
important to remain vigilant in evaluating the mitogenic
potential of all insulin analogues.
in receptor–binding studies,  xxxd2362xxx  generally
behaved comparably to rhi with respect to ir and  xxxg1145xxx 
affinity. mitogenicity of  xxxd2362xxx  was also similar to
that of rhi in four of five cell lines tested, including ex vivo
hsmcs. the only exception was a sixfold to eightfold
increase in  xxxg1145xxx  binding and mitogenicity in saos/b10
osteosarcoma cells when  xxxd2362xxx  was used, but

a values are numbers of tumours observed in each group.
b p < 0.05 versus nacl control.
c p < 0.01 versus nacl control.

at doses that were well above the concentrations typically
achieved in vivo by  xxxd2362xxx  [30]. however,
this finding of altered in vitro  xxxg1145xxx  binding was not
translated into any in vivo effects, as determined in rodent
carcinogenic studies of up to 2 years duration. currently
available studies have indicated no increased risk for
cancer, and no changes in the risk for development or
progression of diabetic retinopathy have been reported in
patients treated with  xxxd2362xxx , further confirming
the safety of this basal insulin analogue.
