abstract
rationale recent studies provide evidence for reduced
phosphodiesterase-4b ( xxxg1698xxx ) as a genetic susceptibility
factor as well as suggesting an association of several single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in  xxxg1698xxx  that are
associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia.
objectives the aim of the current study was to assess the
activity of  xxxd3142xxx , a nonsubtype-selective pde4 inhibitor,
in several animal models predictive of antipsychotic-like
efficacy and side-effect liability and to use  xxxg1698xxx  wildtype and knockout mice to begin to understand the subtypes
involved in the activity of  xxxd3142xxx .
results in rats,  xxxd3142xxx  antagonized both phencyclidine
hydrochloride- and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity
and inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (car). in
 xxxg1698xxx  wild-type mice,  xxxd3142xxx  dose-dependently suppressed car (ed50 =2.4 mg/kg); however, in knockout
mice, their sensitivity to  xxxd3142xxx  at the higher doses (1.0
and 3.2 mg/kg) was reduced, resulting in a threefold shift in
the ed50 (7.3 mg/kg), suggesting  xxxg1698xxx  is involved, at
least in part, with the activity of  xxxd3142xxx . only the highest
dose of  xxxd3142xxx  (3.2 mg/kg) produced a modest but
significant degree of catalepsy.
conclusions  xxxd3142xxx  has a pharmacologic profile similar
to that of the atypical antipsychotics and has low
extrapyramidal symptom liability. these results suggest
that  xxxg1698xxx  mediates the antipsychotic effects of  xxxd3142xxx 
in car and that the  xxxg1698xxx -regulated cyclic adenosine
monophosphate signaling pathway may play a role in the
pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.

introduction
phosphodiesterases (pdes) belonging to the pde4 family
control intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) by catalyzing its hydrolysis (conti
et al. 2003; houslay 2001). four separate pde4 genes
( xxxg1697xxx ,  xxxg1698xxx ,  xxxg1699xxx , and  xxxg1700xxx ) have been identified, and all are characterized by a low km, ca2+
insensitivity, and specificity for camp as a substrate
(beavo 1995). these four isozymes have also been shown
to produce multiple splice variants (conti et al. 2003).
 xxxg1697xxx ,  xxxg1698xxx , and  xxxg1700xxx  are widely expressed
throughout the brain, but regional and intracellular distribution for each subtype is distinct, whereas  xxxg1699xxx  is
expressed only minimally within the central nervous
system, particularly in the rodent (cherry and davis 1999;
iona et al. 1998; lobban et al. 1994; mcphee et al. 1995;
perez-torres et al. 2000).
 xxxd3142xxx  ((+)-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)2-pyrrolidone) is one of the most widely studied pde
inhibitors (schneider 1984; wachtel 1983) and has been
used extensively as a pharmacological tool.  xxxd3142xxx  is
well absorbed, shows good bioavailability, and after oral or
subcutaneous administration in rat, the serum half-life of
 xxxd3142xxx  is about 1 h (krause and kuhne 1988, 1993).
 xxxd3142xxx  inhibits all pde4 subtypes (mackenzie and
houslay 2000; robichaud et al. 2002) and has no reported
activity at other pdes, enzymes, or neurotransmitter
receptors. unfortunately, one of the major limitations
within the pde4 field is the lack of commercially available

416

subtype-selective inhibitors. however, the recent availability of genetically modified mice that lack either the  xxxg1698xxx 
or  xxxg1700xxx  genes has made studies exploring the role of
these subtypes possible (jin et al. 1999, 2005).
the widespread distribution of pde4 isozymes suggests
an opportunity for the development of pde4 inhibitors as
potential therapeutic targets. in fact, a variety of central and
peripheral effects have been described after administration
of pde4 inhibitors such as  xxxd3142xxx . pde4 has been
reported to be involved in the control of mood, memory,
emesis, and immune and inflammatory processes (for recent
reviews see houslay et al. 2005; zhang et al. 2005). to
date, only a few preclinical studies have suggested a
potential role for pde4 in schizophrenia (davis and gould
2005; maxwell et al. 2004; mori et al. 2000) and only one
clinical study has been reported (pietzcker et al. 1979).
however, a recent report provides evidence for  xxxg1698xxx  as a
genetic susceptibility factor for schizophrenia (millar et al.
2005). furthermore, additional studies have also suggested
an association of several snps in  xxxg1698xxx  that are
associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia in
the general population (king et al. 2006). the aim of the
present study was to use both pharmacologic and genetic
tools to determine the potential role of pde4 in psychosis.
we have used  xxxd3142xxx  as a nonsubtype-selective pde4
inhibitor in several animal models used to predict antipsychotic efficacy. to begin to understand the subtype
involved in the activity of  xxxd3142xxx ,  xxxg1698xxx  knockout mice
were also utilized in this study. the results demonstrate that
the pharmacologic effects of  xxxd3142xxx  are very similar to
those of the atypical antipsychotics. furthermore, these
results suggest that  xxxg1698xxx  mediates, at least in part, the
antipsychotic effects of  xxxd3142xxx  and that the pde4bregulated camp signaling pathway may play a role in the
pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.

materials and methods
animals male cd rats (250–350 g), cf rats (fisher 344,
300–350 g), or  xxxg1986xxx /lacj mice (25–30 g) from the
charles river laboratories (kingston, ny) were used.
 xxxg1698xxx  knockout mice to establish our breeding colonies
were obtained from dr. marco conti (stanford university,
california). colonies of  xxxg1698xxx  mice (c57/bl6n background) were established and maintained at the charles
river laboratories. the animals were group housed in
plastic cages in temperature- and humidity-controlled
rooms on a 12-h light/dark cycle for at least 1 week before
experimentation. food and water were available ad libitum.
animals were handled and cared for in accordance with the
guide for the care and use of laboratory animals
(national research council 1996), and all procedures were

psychopharmacology (2007) 192:415–424

performed with the approval of the pfizer animal care and
use committee.
drug administration vehicles used consisted of 5%
emulphor (an emulsifying agent), 5%  xxxd1896xxx 
and 90% saline for  xxxd3142xxx  and d- xxxd163xxx 
(amph), distilled water for phencyclidine hydrochloride
(pcp), and 0.3% tartaric acid for haloperidol and clozapine.
all drugs were administered subcutaneously (sc) in a
volume of 10 ml/kg body weight for mice and 1–2 ml/kg
of body weight for rats. all drugs doses were expressed as
the weight of the base molecule (i.e. salt corrected) with the
exception of amph. all drugs were purchased from
sigma-aldrich with the exception of  xxxd3142xxx  which was
synthesized at pfizer.
inhibition of conditioned avoidance responding inhibition
of conditioned avoidance responding (car) is a widely
used model for the characterization of potential antipsychotic drugs (for review, see wadenberg and hicks
1999). male cf rats (fisher-344 strain) were chosen for
their ability to learn the car task. testing was performed
between 08:00 and 12:00 hours, during the “lights-on”
period of the light/dark cycle. experiments were performed
using commercially available equipment (coulbourn,
allentown, pa) as previously described (siuciak et al.
2006a,b). the plexiglas shuttle boxes were divided by a
guillotine door into two sides and enclosed in soundattenuating chambers. these shuttle boxes were fitted with
metal grid floors equipped with scrambled/constant current shockers. training consisted of repeated pairings of a
conditioned stimulus (activation of house lights and the
opening of the guillotine door), followed 5 s later by a 1.5ma shock for rats and a 0.6-ma shock for mice. the
shock was terminated when the animal crossed to the other
side of the shuttle box or after 10 s. thirty trials were
completed per session, and the number of avoidances
(maximum 30), escapes (maximum 30), escape failures
(maximum 30), latency to avoid (maximum 5 s), latency
to escape (maximum 10 s), and adaptation crossovers
(number of crossovers for a 5-min period before the onset
of trials, dark chamber) were recorded by the computer
program. intertrial intervals were 30 s and were conducted
with the guillotine door closed. training was continued
until a shock avoidance criterion of 80% avoidance was
achieved on three successive sessions, at which point
animals were used for drug studies. drugs were administered 30 min before the test session. for drug treatment
studies, vehicle treatment was performed 1 day each week,
and statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test
comparing each drug treatment vs the vehicle treatment
performed earlier that week. for the acquisition studies in
wild-type and knockout mice, scores were ranked within

psychopharmacology (2007) 192:415–424

each treatment group for comparison by a kruskal–wallis
analysis of variance. post hoc analysis was performed
using a mann–whitney u test.
sensitivity to foot shock to determine whether the suppression of car by  xxxd3142xxx  was due to an alteration in
nociceptive sensitivity, we examined the effects of systemically administered  xxxd3142xxx  on reactivity to foot shock
using a modification of crocker and russell (1984). a
naïve group of fisher-344 rats received either vehicle,
morphine (5.6 mg/kg, sc), or  xxxd3142xxx  (0.1–3.2 mg/kg, sc)
and, 30 min later, were placed into the conditioning
chamber and given unsignaled foot shocks of increasing
amplitude. starting with 0.1 ma, foot shock was increased
in 0.1-ma increments until three response thresholds were
reached: notice (an orienting head movement or lifting of
one paw), jump (three or more paws raised off the bars),
and vocalizing. the adjustments in shock intensity were
made in accordance to each animal’s response. the
intensity was raised by one unit when no response occurred
and lowered by one unit when a response was made. the
intensity was then raised, and the second response threshold
was recorded. statistical analysis was performed using a
one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by
fisher’s test.
inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity the effect of
 xxxd3142xxx  on spontaneous locomotor activity in male cd rats
was assessed under conditions associated with high
baseline activity (dark cycle) to determine its potential
locomotor activity suppressant properties and to evaluate
the possible contribution of general behavioral depression
to the results obtained in other tests (siuciak et al. 2006b).
the locomotor activity boxes consisted of 48 individual
plexiglas behavioral chambers (30×30 cm) enclosed in
sound-attenuating cabinets. a single 10-w bulb in each
cabinet was controlled by a 24-h timer. the plexiglas
chambers were fitted with grid floors, which were divided
into quadrants, and a metal touch plate, which was
positioned 7 cm from the floor on all four walls of the
chamber. horizontal locomotor activity is measured as the
number of crossovers an animal made from one quadrant to
another within its chamber. the test was begun at the onset
of the dark cycle (16:00 hours), and the computer was
programmed to collect data overnight for a 12-h period. at
the beginning of the 12-h dark cycle, male cd rats were
administered vehicle or drug at an appropriate pretreatment
time. studies used a 60-min pretreatment time, and animals
were returned to their home cage after drug administration.
treatment group means were compared with a one-way
anova followed by dunnett’s test. the ed50 values were
calculated by linear regression analysis of the dose–
response data.

antagonism of pcp and amph-induced hyperactivity  xxxd3142xxx 
was tested for its ability to antagonize either pcp- or
d -amph-induced hyperactivity in rats as previously
described (siuciak et al. 2006b). male cd rats were
habituated in the locomotor chambers overnight before
the experiment. the next day, each animal was weighed
and treated with either vehicle or drug and immediately
returned to the test chamber. after a 60-min pretreatment time, animals were again removed from the test
chambers and treated with either pcp (3.2 mg/kg, sc),
or amph (1 mg/kg, sc) and then immediately returned
to the test chamber. horizontal activity (crossovers) was
recorded for 3 h after stimulant administration. treatment group means were compared with a one-way
anova followed by dunnett’s test. the id50 values,
defined as the dose that produced a 50% inhibition of the
vehicle/stimulant treatment group, were calculated by
linear regression analysis of the dose–response data using
an excel-based computer curve-fitting program.
induction of catalepsy  xxxd3142xxx  was evaluated for cataleptogenic activity using a modification of the procedure
of costall et al. (1975).  xxxd3142xxx  was administered
either alone or concurrently with haloperidol (0.32
mg/kg, sc). testing was accomplished by placing each
rat in an upright position with its forepaws resting on a
horizontal bar (9 mm diameter) suspended at a height of
10 cm. the latency for the rat to remove the forepaws and
climb down to a normal posture was recorded. animals
not responding within 90 s were removed from the
apparatus and assigned a latency of 90 s. animals were
tested at 30, 60, and 120 min after drug administration.
latencies were ranked within each treatment group for
comparison by a kruskall–wallis analysis of variance.
post hoc analysis was performed using a mann–whitney
u test.

results
pharmacological studies using  xxxd3142xxx , a pde4 inhibitor
conditioned avoidance responding in rats,  xxxd3142xxx  administration resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of car
with an ed50 value of 0.25 mg/kg (95% ci=0.14–0.46,
fig. 1) without producing escape failures. similar results were
found in  xxxg1986xxx /lacj mice (ed50 =0.56 mg/kg, 95% ci=
0.21–1.44, data not shown). when compared to other
antipsychotic agents assayed under identical experimental
conditions, the order of potencies for inhibiting car was
haloperidol>risperidone> xxxd3142xxx >ziprasidone≫clozapine
(table 1).

as the car test utilizes foot shock, control experiments were conducted to assess for potential rolipraminduced alterations in nociceptive sensitivity (fig. 2). a
two-way anova indicated a significant effect of treatment on all behaviors: notice (f5, 42 =8.0, p<0.0001),
jump (f5, 42 =17.3, p<0.0001), and vocalize (f5, 42 =5.7,
p<0.0004). post-hoc analysis indicated morphine (5.6 mg/kg,
sc), used as a positive control, produced significant
increases in all behaviors examined. the effects of  xxxd3142xxx 
administration were less consistent. compared to vehicletreated rats,  xxxd3142xxx  produced a dose-dependent increase in
the “jump” response threshold. in contrast, only the highest
dose (3.2 mg/kg) of  xxxd3142xxx  produced a significant effect
(p=0.001) on the “notice” response, and no effects were
observed for the “vocalize” response.

antagonism of amph-induced hyperactivity a one-way
anova indicated an overall effect of treatment on
locomotor activity (f5, 90 =14.8, p<0.0001). post-hoc
analysis revealed administration of d-amph increased
horizontal locomotor activity from an average of approximately 32 to 655 quadrant crossings when measured over a
3-h period (p<0.0001, data not shown).  xxxd3142xxx  dosedependently antagonized this response, with an ed50 value
of 0.46 mg/kg (95% ci = 0.34–0.63, fig. 3). when
compared to other antipsychotic agents assayed under
identical experimental conditions, the order of potencies
for antagonizing amph induced hyperactivity was
haloperidol>risperidone>ziprasidone> xxxd3142xxx >clozapine
(table 1).
inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity treatment of
rats with vehicle resulted in approximately 250 quadrant
crossings during the 3-h time period after placement into
the locomotor chambers. this period of observation
corresponds to the data collection period used in the
amph- and pcp-stimulated locomotor activity procedures.
there was an overall effect of treatment on locomotor
activity (f5, 89 = 18.2, p < 0.0001) such that  xxxd3142xxx 
administration dose-dependently decreased horizontal locomotor activity with an ed50 value of 2.54 mg/kg (95% ci=

antipsychotics, only clozapine administration up to 56 mg/kg
failed to produce catalepsy. in contrast, haloperidol, risperidone, and ziprasidone achieved a significant degree of

discussion
previous studies have reported that  xxxd3142xxx  is a potent and
selective pde4 inhibitor. the present study demonstrates
that  xxxd3142xxx  may be a novel antipsychotic drug with a low
risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps). in our study,
 xxxd3142xxx , similar to other antipsychotic agents, was active
in a dose-dependent manner in several animal models
indicative of antipsychotic activity.
in both rats and mice,  xxxd3142xxx  suppressed car, a
commonly used test to screen for antipsychotic activity
(wadenberg and hicks 1999), at doses that did not produce
response failures. the dose-related effects of  xxxd3142xxx  in
car were similar to that of haloperidol, clozapine,
risperidone, and ziprasidone (siuciak et al. 2006b) tested
under similar experimental conditions. in studies using
genetically modified mice,  xxxg1698xxx  wild-type mice showed
a clear dose-dependent suppression of car to  xxxd3142xxx 
(ed50 =2.4 mg/kg). in contrast,  xxxg1698xxx  knockout mice
showed a blunted response to  xxxd3142xxx , which was
particularly evident at the higher doses where there was
never greater than a 50% suppression of the  xxxd3142xxx  effect
on avoidance responding (ed50 =7.3 mg/kg). the reduced
effect of  xxxd3142xxx  in  xxxg1698xxx  knockout mice was not due to
the fact that these animals were unable to respond
appropriately to any antipsychotic, as the effects of
clozapine were similar in wild-type and knockout mice.
these studies suggest that  xxxg1698xxx  mediates the antipsychotic-like effect of  xxxd3142xxx . however, the effect of
 xxxd3142xxx  in  xxxg1698xxx  knockout mice was diminished but
not completely abolished, suggesting that another pde4
subtype, possibly  xxxg1697xxx  or  xxxg1700xxx , is also involved.
studies are currently underway with  xxxg1700xxx  wild-type and
knockout mice; unfortunately, these studies are complicated
by two issues. first,  xxxg1700xxx  deficient mice, which must be
maintained on a mixed background (c57bl6n/129), show
impaired growth and decreased fertility (jin et al. 1999).
second, mice on this mixed background strain (i.e., both
 xxxg1700xxx  wild-type and knockout mice) take longer to
acquire the car task and are also difficult to maintain at
criteria after training (chapin and siuciak, unpublished
observations). in contrast,  xxxg1698xxx  wild-type and knockout

421

mice, which are on a c57/bl6n background, have no
breeding issues and were able to rapidly acquire and
maintain their performance in car. this is similar to
results obtained with c57bl/6j mice (chapin and siuciak,
unpublished observations) and  xxxg1986xxx /lacj mice, which
represent the background strain for the  xxxg1690xxx  knockout
mice (siuciak et al. 2006a). thus, the background strain is
an important consideration when using the car test in
genetically modified mice. the ed50 values for  xxxd3142xxx  in
car also varied with species and strain: 0.14 mg/kg in rat,
0.56 mg/kg in dba/1lacj mice, and 2.54 mg/kg in  xxxg1698xxx 
wild-type mice (c57/bl6n).
one consideration related to the car data obtained with
 xxxd3142xxx  is the increase in the nociceptive threshold
observed in the foot-shock sensitivity test. although our
effects in foot-shock sensitivity were less consistent across
the various behaviors compared to morphine, dose-dependent increases in the “jump” response were observed. in the
car test, antipsychotic agents selectively suppress the
avoidance response without producing response failures.
with drug-induced increases in nociceptive thresholds, one
might predict increased response failures, which were not
observed with  xxxd3142xxx  in the present studies. it is also of
interest to note that the ed50 value obtained for  xxxd3142xxx  in
car (0.25 mg/kg) is similar to the values obtained for our
other efficacy models (pcp- and amph-induced hyperactivity, 0.14 and 0.46 mg/kg, respectively), which are
unaffected by changes in nociceptive thresholds.
many studies suggest alterations in dopaminergic signaling are a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia (carlsson 1988; carlsson et al. 2004).
although evidence for increased dopaminergic transmission
in schizophrenia is not conclusive (carlsson 2001), several
studies have reported increased striatal dopaminergic
activity in schizophrenic patients (breier et al. 1997;
laruelle et al. 1996).  xxxd3142xxx , along with other antipsychotic agents, including haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone,
and ziprasidone (siuciak et al. 2006b), reversed amphstimulated locomotion. although the efficacy of  xxxd3142xxx  in
amph-stimulated locomotor activity occurs via increases
in camp levels in the brain via inhibition of camp
metabolism without stimulating neurotransmitter receptors
directly (schneider 1984) or altering the levels of dopamine
release and metabolism (kehr et al. 1985), it remains to be
seen whether it would reduce the hyperdopaminergic state
reported in schizophrenic patients.
alterations in glutamatergic signaling may play a role in
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (goff and coyle
2001; olney and farber 1995; tamminga 1998). n-methyld-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists, such as pcp and
ketamine, can induce psychotomimetic effects in
humans (krystal et al. 1994). based on this, pcp and
nmda antagonists are often used as a model of

422

schizophrenia, both in humans and in animals (abi-saab
et al. 1998). acute pcp administration in rats and mice
can produce changes in locomotor activity, cognitive
performance, and sensorimotor gating, and inhibition of
pcp-induced hyperactivity is a commonly used assay in
screening for antipsychotic agents (for reviews see
halberstadt 1995; jentsch and roth 1999; morris et al.
2005).  xxxd3142xxx , like other classical and atypical antipsychotic agents tested under these same experimental
conditions (siuciak et al. 2006b), blocked the increase in
locomotor activity seen after administration of pcp.
previous studies have suggested that  xxxd3142xxx  potentiates
glutamate release from prefrontal cortex nerve terminals
(wang 2006).  xxxd3142xxx  has also been reported to attenuate
mk-801-induced deficits in latent inhibition (davis and
gould 2005). thus, these data suggest that inhibition of
pde4 modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission.
one of the most significant adverse effects of dopamine
receptor blockade associated with current antipsychotic
treatments is the occurrence of eps. catalepsy is used as
a preclinical animal model of extrapyramidal side effects in
humans, and  xxxd3142xxx  produces only modest cataleptic
effects at a dose 7- to 23-fold higher than the ed50 values
obtained in the efficacy models (pcp and amph-stimulated hyperlocomotion and car). this is in contrast to other
antipsychotic compounds tested under similar conditions
including haloperidol, risperidone, and ziprasidone, which
produced significant levels of catalepsy.  xxxd3142xxx  also
produced only a modest potentiation of haloperidol-induced
catalepsy when administered concurrently.  xxxd3142xxx  significantly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity; however,
the ed50 for spontaneous locomotor activity was 2.54
mg/kg, 5- to18-fold higher than the ed50 values observed
for pcp and amph-stimulated locomotor and car (0.14,
0.46 and 0.25 mg/kg, respectively). although it is possible
that effects on spontaneous locomotor activity may contribute at least in part to activity in our efficacy models, it is
of interest to note that our antipsychotic standards (haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone) also
produced significant decreases in spontaneous locomotor
activity, in some cases, with less separation between their
activity in efficacy models and the ed50 values observed
for spontaneous locomotor activity (see table 1).
cognitive impairment has long been recognized as central
to the abnormalities that occur in schizophrenia. previous
studies have reported effects of  xxxd3142xxx  in cognition models
(for review see blokland et al. 2006; ghavami et al. 2006)
although the pde4 subtype mediating this effect is not yet
clear, these studies suggest that pde4 inhibitors may also
be useful for treating the cognitive deficits associated with
schizophrenia.
these studies are the first to assess the antipsychotic-like
activity of pde4 inhibitors across a broad panel of efficacy

psychopharmacology (2007) 192:415–424

and side-effect liability animal models; however, several
previous studies have suggested a similar role for  xxxd3142xxx .
previous studies have reported effects of  xxxd3142xxx  in
amph-disrupted auditory sensory processing and prepulse
inhibition (maxwell et al. 2004; kanes et al. 2006).
 xxxd3142xxx  has also been shown to reverse mk-801 induced
deficits in latent inhibition (davis and gould 2005).
 xxxd3142xxx  also decreases methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (mori et al. 2000). the present study is also the
first to begin to determine the role of the various pde4
subtypes in antipsychotic-like effects of  xxxd3142xxx . in the
present study,  xxxg1698xxx  appears to play an essential role in
mediating the actions of  xxxd3142xxx  in the car model. the
localization of  xxxg1698xxx  has been studied in a variety of
species (cherry and davis 1999; perez-torres et al. 2000).
in the rat, high levels of  xxxg1698xxx  mrna and protein have
been reported in the basal ganglia and associated areas
(striatum, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra), regions associated with neuropsychiatric
disorders including schizophrenia (for review, see graybiel
2000). recent studies have provided evidence for  xxxg1698xxx 
as a genetic susceptibility factor for schizophrenia (millar et
al. 2005). furthermore, additional studies have also
suggested an association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms in  xxxg1698xxx  that are associated with an increased
incidence of schizophrenia in the general population (king
et al. 2006). thus, the  xxxg1698xxx -regulated camp signaling
pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and
pharmacotherapy of psychosis. to the best of our knowledge, only a single study has reported the use of  xxxd3142xxx  in
schizophrenic patients (pietzcker et al. 1979). some
improvement of symptoms appeared to be observed within
this study; however, treatment was limited by side effects
(nausea and vomiting).
 xxxg1690xxx  is a dual substrate  xxxg1696xxx  expressed primarily in dopaminoreceptive medium spiny neurons of the striatum (seeger et al. 2003). we
have recently reported that papaverine, a  xxxg1690xxx  inhibitor,
showed efficacy in animal models of antipsychotic-like
activity and displayed diminished activity in  xxxg1690xxx 
knockout mice (siuciak et al. 2006b).  xxxd3142xxx  has no
affinity for the  xxxg1690xxx  enzyme (ic50 =47 um, soderling
et al. 1999), thus activity at the  xxxg1690xxx  site does not
confound the present results. papaverine administration
increases tissue levels of striatal cyclic guanine monophosphate and elevates extracellular levels of striatal camp.
in addition, papaverine increases the phosphorylation of
camp-response-element-binding protein and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, markers of striatal activation
attributable to increases in camp. similar effects were
observed after administration of either haloperidol or skf81297, activators of adenylyl cyclase in the indirect and
direct pathway (siuciak et al. 2006b).

psychopharmacology (2007) 192:415–424

 xxxd3142xxx , an inhibitor of type 4 camp-phosphodiestase,
increases striatal camp levels (iyo et al. 1996; schmidt and
harms, pfizer, personal communication). dopamine d2
receptors are coupled to inhibitory g proteins and increase
adenylyl cyclase activity when blocked by d2 antagonists
such as haloperidol (kaneko et al. 1992; onali et al. 1985;
siuciak et al. 2006b). however, although antagonism at the
 xxxg656xxx  remains the primary mechanism of
typical antipsychotic drugs, the pharmacology of the newer
atypical agents is not yet well understood and may involve
other g-protein-linked receptor pathways that utilize camp
as a second messenger. drugs such as  xxxd3142xxx , which work
via a final common pathway to increase adenylate cyclase,
may possess advantages over receptor selective agents,
particularly for a disorder such as schizophrenia, which is
known to involve multiple biochemical abnormalities (for
reviews see pearlson 2000; wong and van tol 2003).
in conclusion, the present study suggests the potential
antipsychotic properties of the pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx .
 xxxd3142xxx  is active in conventional tests predictive of
antipsychotic activity such as suppression of car and
inhibition of pcp- and amph-stimulated locomotion and
showed a good separation between activity in efficacy
and side-effect liability models such as spontaneous
locomotor activity and catalepsy, suggesting that  xxxd3142xxx 
possesses a substantial therapeutic window regarding
antipsychotic vs motor side effects.  xxxd3142xxx , a pde4
inhibitor, represents a receptor-independent mechanism of
treating psychosis rather than a direct antagonist activity
at dopaminergic receptors. studies using genetically
modified mice suggest the  xxxg1698xxx  subtype plays an
essential role, at least in part, in mediating the effects of
 xxxd3142xxx  but that it is not necessary for the antipyschotic
effects of clozapine. finally, previous studies have
reported that  xxxd3142xxx  may be effective in treating both
the positive symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. although  xxxd3142xxx  offers a useful tool for
preclinical studies, it has limited use clinically, thus the
development of potent subtype-selective inhibitors of
 xxxg1698xxx  will be needed to further validate this hypothesis.
