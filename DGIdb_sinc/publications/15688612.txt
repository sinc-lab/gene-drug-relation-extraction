 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) inhibition by small molecules.  angiogenesis is essential for primary tumours to grow and metastasise, and is driven by the production of positive angiogenic factors. the  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) family is central to the process of angiogenesis and comprises 5 molecules designated a, b, c, d and e. vegf is overexpressed in several solid malignancies. the actions of vegf are mediated through receptors possessing  xxxg2198xxx  activity:  xxxg800xxx  ( xxxg800xxx ),  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx ) and  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ).  xxxd328xxx  strategies include the use of antibodies to vegf or its receptors, the use of ribozymes to decrease receptor expression, and the use of inhibitors of  xxxg2198xxx  to reduce receptor activation and downstream signalling. the focus of this review is small molecule inhibitors of vegf receptors which target their intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  activity. the clinical development of the following agents is discussed:  xxxd3191xxx ,  xxxd3264xxx , su6668,  xxxd3496xxx , zd6474.
