 xxxg131xxx  has previously been identified as a tight binding protein of
the polyglutamate forms of tetrahydrofolate (r. j.
cook and c. wagner, biochemistry 21, 4427– 4434,
1982). each subunit contains two independently
folded domains connected by a linking peptide. by
using the stable substrate and product analogs 10formyl 5,8-dideazafolate and 5,8-dideazafolate, respectively, we have determined that the tight binding folate site is separate from the catalytic site and that it is
located on the n-terminal domain of the protein. this
was achieved by cross-linking 10-formyl 5,8-dideazafolate to the dehydrogenase through the carboxyl group
of the substrate analog. the cross-linked substrate analog was converted to the cross-linked product complex by adding either nadp 1 or 2- xxxd26xxx ,
proving that the 10-formyl 5,8-dideazafolate was
bound at the active site. with the active site crosslinked to 5,8-dideazafolate and not available for binding, the enzyme still bound 5,8-dideazafolate-[ 3h]tetraglutamate tightly but noncovalently. separation of the
large and small domains by limited proteolysis showed
that the tightly bound 5,8-dideazafolate-[ 3h]tetraglutamate was located on the small domain. the location
of the cross-linked 10-formyl 5,8-dideazafolate at the
active site was determined by amino acid sequencing
of an isolated tryptic peptide. © 1999 academic press

the enzyme  xxxg131xxx  (ftd; 3 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:nadp 1 oxidoreductase,  xxxg131xxx ) catalyzes the conversion of
10-cho-h 4  xxxd2146xxx  n to h 4  xxxd2146xxx  n and co 2 using
nadp 1 as electron acceptor. ftd from rabbit liver
consists of four identical 99-kda subunits (1). this is in
agreement with rat ftd, which has been cloned and
the amino acid sequence determined from the cdna
sequence (2). in addition to the 10-cho-h 4pteglu n
dehydrogenase activity, this enzyme shows aldehyde
dehydrogenase and 10-cho-h 4pteglu n hydrolase activities, although it has been suggested that these two
activities might not be physiologically important (3–5).
each subunit contains two independently folded domains connected by a linking peptide. the substrate
10-cho-h 4pteglu n binds to the n-terminal domain
which catalyzes the hydrolase activity, while nadp 1
binds to the c-terminal domain which catalyzes the
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (1, 2, 6, 7).
ftd was identified as being one of several “folatebinding proteins” in rat liver (8, 9). enzymes purified
from rat, pig, and rabbit liver have been shown to bind
h 4pteglu 5 so tightly that the coenzyme remains bound
during size-exclusion chromatography. one h 4pteglu 5
molecule is bound per enzyme subunit (3). although
the h 4pteglu 5 has been shown to be a potent product

inhibitor of ftd activity, the tightly bound h 4pteglu 5
does not affect the steady-state kinetic properties of
this enzyme (3). this suggests that the h 4pteglu 5 tight
binding site on this enzyme is separate from the catalytic site. wagner et al. (4) have shown that two
5-formyltetrahydrofolate molecules were bound per
subunit of rat liver ftd. however, the location of these
two 5-formyltetrahydrofolate binding sites was not determined.
the physiological significance of ftd is still unclear,
although it has been suggested that this enzyme might
be responsible for removing excess one-carbon units in
the folate pool (10). it is reasonable to hypothesize that
this enzyme plays a major role in liver cell one-carbon
metabolism since it represents more than 1% of total
cellular soluble protein (3). since this enzyme is very
abundant in liver cells and binds to h 4pteglu 5 tightly
it may serve as a storage form of excess h 4pteglu n.
the purpose of this study was to confirm that there is
both a catalytic site and a tight binding site for
h 4pteglu n on ftd and to locate these sites by crosslinking the carboxyl group of a substrate analog with
an amino group on the enzyme. these studies were
greatly enhanced by the previous observation that the
stable folate analog 10-cho-5,8-ddf was a good substrate and that the polyglutamate forms of the product
analog 5,8-ddf also bind tightly to the enzyme (3, 11).
experimental procedures
materials. all coenzymes, buffers, amino acids, and chromatography materials were obtained from either sigma or fisher. fractogel emd tmae-650 chromatography beads were obtained from em
separations technology (gibbstown, nj). a c4 reversed-phase column (4.6 mm 3 2.5 cm) was purchased from phenomenex corp.
3
l-[ h 2,3,4 ]glutamate (45 ci/mmol) was purchased from amersham
corp. 5,8-ddf and 10-cho-5,8-ddf were purchased from dr. john
hynes (university of south carolina). (6s)5-cho-h 4pteglu 5 was
synthesized as previously described (12). rabbit liver recombinant
cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase was purified by the procedure of di salvo et al. (13) and ftd purified by the procedure of
kim et al. (3). mouse folypolyglutamate synthetase was a generous
gift from dr. richard moran (virginia commonwealth university).
preparation of tritiated polyglutamate forms of 10-cho-5,8-ddf
and 5,8-ddf. the tritiated polyglutamate forms of 10-cho-5,8ddf and 5,8-ddf were prepared basically according to the method
of moran and colman (14). 5,8-ddf (0.05 mg) was incubated with
folypolyglutamate synthetase (10 mg), 3 mm glutamate enriched
with 7.23 3 10 7 cpm of l-[ 3h 2,3,4]glutamate, and 10 mm atp at 30°c
for 16 h. the tritiated 5,8-ddf–polyglutamate forms were purified
on a c4 reverse-phase column by hplc using a linear gradient of
100% methanol as the a solvent and 5 mm tetrabutylammonium
phosphate in 5% methanol as the b solvent for 40 min at a flow rate
of 1 ml per minute. the progress of the folylpolyglutamate synthetase reaction was analyzed by hplc every hour so that the
elution of the di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaglutamate forms of 5,8-ddf
could be identified by a lengthening of the elution time. most of the
material after 16 h was a combination of the tetra- and pentaglutamate forms. these were isolated separately although no difference
could be detected between the tetra- and pentaglutamate forms of
5,8-ddf in any experiment involving ftd binding.

cross-linking of 10-cho-5,8-ddf to ftd. 10-cho-5,8-ddf, 1.3
mmol, was incubated on ice for 10 min with 1.3 mmol of ethyl dimethyl carbodiimide in 20 mm phosphate, ph 6.8. then 20 nmol of
purified ftd in 20 mm phosphate, ph 6.8, was added to the activated 10-cho-5,8-ddf and incubated on ice for an additional 10
min. the cross-linked ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf complex was separated from the free 10-cho-5,8-ddf on a p6-dg column (0.7 3 20
cm) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate, ph 6.8, and 2 mm dtt.
fractions of 400 ml were collected and absorbance at 280 nm was
determined. the fractions containing protein were pooled and 2- xxxd26xxx  was added to 10 mm. this procedure was repeated for
cross-linking 5,8-ddf to ftd.
conversion of the ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf covalent complex to ftd5,8-ddf. the cross-linked ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf complex was incubated with either 10 or 100 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  at 30°c for 2 h.
spectra were recorded every 10 to 20 min. the hydrolase activity of
ftd was observed to convert the 10-cho-5,8-ddf to 5,8-ddf by
noting the increase in absorbance at 310 nm. 10-cho-5,8-ddf does
not absorb at 300 nm while 5,8-ddf does absorb with an e 310 nm 5
18,400 m 21 cm 21 (3). this was determined from the spectrum of
purified 5,8-ddf using the e 295 nm 5 22,000 m 21 cm 21 to determine the
concentration of ddf (15). the cross-linked 10-cho-5,8-ddf could
also be converted to cross-linked 5,8-ddf by the dehydrogenase
activity of ftd. 2- xxxd26xxx  was omitted and replaced with
0.15 mm nadp 1 and 5 mm dtt in these experiments. the reaction
was followed by observing the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due
to the formation of nadph. the reaction was complete in the 5 to
10 s it took to mix the reagents.
isolation of a cross-linked 5,8-ddf–ftd peptide. five milligrams of ftd cross-linked with 5,8-ddf at the catalytic site was
digested with 0.1% subtilisin for 5 min at room temperature. the
digested protein was adsorbed to a tmae column (0.8 3 4 cm)
equilibrated with 20 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.3, 14 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the digested ftd was
eluted with a linear gradient with 40 ml of equilibration buffer and
40 ml of 0.5 m nacl in equilibration buffer. two protein fractions
were eluted which were identified as the n-terminal domain and the
c-terminal domain by sds–page as previously described (1). the
fractions corresponding to the n-terminal domain, which contained
the cross-linked 5,8-ddf, were pooled and freeze-dried. this protein
was denatured in urea, and the sulfhydryl groups were blocked and
then digested with trypsin. the tryptic peptides were separated on a
c8 reversed-phase hplc column and the peptide containing the
5,8-ddf was identified by absorption at 310 nm. this peptide was
then sequenced by automated edman degradation on an applied
biosystems 476a instrument (16).
binding of tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate to the ftd–5,8-ddf
covalent complex. after 10-cho-5,8-ddf was cross-linked to the
enzyme and purified on a desalting column, it was split into two
fractions. one fraction was kept on ice. the other fraction was
converted to ftd–5,8-ddf using 2- xxxd26xxx  as described
above. seven nanomoles each of the ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf and
ftd–5,8-ddf complexes was incubated separately with 20 nmol of
tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate on ice for 30 min. then these
complexes were separated from the free tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate on a p6-dg column (1 3 12 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.0, containing 2 mm ddt. each
fraction, 0.4 ml, was measured for absorbance at 280 nm and radioactivity.
h 4pteglu stability assay. a h 4pteglu solution was made to a
final concentration of 0.4 mm in buffer of 50 mm na n,n-bis[2hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate, ph 7.3, 20 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.5 mm edta, and 2 mm ascorbate. in a separate reaction,
10 nmol of h 4pteglu 4 was incubated for 10 min with 5 nmol of ftd.
the reaction mixture was then loaded on a p6-dg column equilibrated with 50 mm na n,n-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate buffer, ph 7.3, and fractions of 400 ml were collected. the

30°c after the addition of 10 mm 2- xxxd26xxx . the increase in
absorbance in the range 300 –330 nm is due to the conversion of
covalently bound 10-cho-5,8-ddf to 5,8-ddf. (inset) the kinetic

fractions with absorbance at 280 nm were pooled and diluted in 50
mm na n,n-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate, ph 7.3,
20 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.5 mm edta and 2 mm ascorbate to a
final ftd subunit concentration of 0.4 mm. spectral analysis showed
that one h 4pteglu 4 molecule was tightly bound per ftd subunit.
the free h 4pteglu and the ftd●h 4pteglu 4 complex were incubated
separately at room temperature. at various time points aliquots
were removed and assayed for remaining h 4pteglu n using the assay
of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and [ 3h]glycine as described
previously (17).

results

identification of the substrate catalytic site. previous studies done in our lab have shown that the substrate 10-cho-h 4pteglu n is bound to the small nterminal domain of ftd (1). to specifically identify the
catalytic site on the small domain, we cross-linked
10-cho-5,8-ddf, a stable 10-cho-h 4pteglu n analog,
to ftd. the carboxyl group of 10-cho-5,8-ddf was
activated by a carbodiimide and then incubated with
the enzyme on ice. greater than 90% of the catalytic
activity of ftd was lost as indicated by assaying aliquots with excess 10-cho-h 4pteglu and nadp 1. to
further confirm that the 10-cho-5,8-ddf was indeed
cross-linked to the catalytic site, the inactivated enzyme was incubated with 2- xxxd26xxx  to convert
10-cho-5,8-ddf to 5,8-ddf. the reaction was followed by the increase in absorbance at 310 nm (fig. 1).
the rate of conversion was dependent on 2-mercapto-

163

ethanol, a characteristic of the hydrolase activity of
ftd (1, 6, 7). also, the conversion of cross-linked 10cho-5,8-ddf to cross-linked 5,8-ddf was observed to
occur within a few seconds when nadp 1 was used,
indicating that the dehydrogenase activity was retained by the cross-linked enzyme. the ability to convert the ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf covalent complex to
the ftd–5,8-ddf covalent complex confirms we are
dealing with the active site of the enzyme. to prove
that the 5,8-ddf was covalently linked to ftd, the
complex was made 0.2% in sds and chromatographed
down a p6-dg column (1 3 15 cm) equilibrated with
nabes, ph 7.3, containing 0.2% sds. the 5,8-ddf
remained bound to the protein as indicated by the
shoulder at 310 nm eluting with the protein fraction
and no observable elution of free 5,8-ddf (data not
shown).
from the increase in absorbance at 310 nm during
the conversion of ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf to ftd–5,8ddf we calculated the stoichiometry of 5,8-ddf bound
to each ftd subunit using the extinction coefficients of
18,372 and 20,140 m 21 cm 21 at 310 and 280 nm, respectively (3). the stoichiometry of cross-linked 10cho-5,8-ddf to the enzyme was 1 6 0.15 molecule of
ddf per subunit for three separate experiments.
the cross-linked 5,8-ddf was digested with subtilisin and chromatographed on a tmae column to separate the large and small domains. the small n-terminal domain eluted first and contained the shoulder
absorbance at 310 nm, indicating that we had crosslinked the 5,8-ddf to the small domain as expected.
the small domain was then digested with trypsin and
the peptides were purified by hplc. a single peptide
absorbed at 310 nm. from automated edman degradation of this fraction, the following sequence was obtained: lpqpeegatyegiqxk, where x corresponded to a mute cycle. the amino acid sequence of
rabbit ftd is not known, but we have shown previously that it is very similar to rat ftd (1). the sequence reported above matches the region 191–206 of
the rat sequence, which is located at the interface
between the small domain and linker peptide as defined by krupenko et al. (6, 7). the x residue corresponds to lys-205 of the rat sequence (fig. 2). because
carbodiimide will activate both carboxyl groups of 10cho-5,8-ddf we do not know if it is cross-linked to
ftd through the a or g carboxyl group. however, 10cho-5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate is not cross-linked to
ftd by carbodiimide activation. this may be because
it is the g carboxyl group of the monoglutamate that is
cross-linked to ftd and that this carboyxl group is not
available in the polyglutamate form.
we also attempted to cross-link 5,8-ddf directly to
ftd. we observed an increase in absorbance at 310 nm
in the ftd–5,8-ddf spectrum with a stoichiometry of
one 5,8-ddf molecule per subunit. however, we failed

on numerous attempts to confirm that any stable covalent bond had been formed. the 310-nm-absorbing material remained bound to the protein during chromatography on the p6-dg column but no tryptic peptide(s) could be isolated with the bound ddf.
incubation of the cross-linked complex at ph 10 for 2 h
resulted in separation of the protein and 310-nm-absorbing material. this suggests that a putative crosslinked ddf is present as either an ester or a thioester
but is not stable to isolation for sequence analysis. the
failure to form a stable ftd–5,8-ddf complex suggests that 5,8-ddf is most likely bound in a different
environment than the 10-cho-5,8-ddf. this may be
in part because the 5,8-ddf is bound preferentially at
another site (a tight binding site) and that there is no
lys residue near the activated carboxyl group to form
the cross-linked stable amide bond.
evidence for a folate tight binding site. in the previous paragraph we demonstrated that it is possible to
block the catalytic site of ftd by cross-linking with
10-cho-5,8-ddf. furthermore, this substrate analog
can be converted to 5,8-ddf, which will still be bound
at the catalytic site. if there is another tight binding
folate site then it should still be unoccupied. to test
this, we took the cross-linked ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf
complex and converted a 50% aliquot of it to the ftd–
5,8-ddf covalent complex using 2- xxxd26xxx .
then, to each sample we added tritium-labeled 5,8ddf–tetraglutamate. each fraction was chromatographed down a p6-dg desalting column to separate
the unbound tritium-labeled 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate.
fractions were collected and both protein (a 280 nm) and
tritium content determined. figure 3a shows the elution profile for the experiment with the cross-linked
ftd–10-cho-5,8-ddf complex. from the known specific activity of the tritium-labeled 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate, we calculate that about 0.2 equivalent of the
ddf polyglutamate is bound tightly to each ftd subunit. the average of three determinations gave 0.25 6
0.1 for tightly bound 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate.

figure 3b shows the results of this experiment when
the 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate was added to the ftd–
5,8-ddf covalent complex. in this case, we found
0.87 6 0.2 molecule of the tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate tightly bound for four determinations. the
large variation in amount of tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate bound was with four different preparations
of cross-linked ftd–5,8-ddf. it appears that each
preparation of purified ftd already contains some
tightly bound 5,8-ddf. this is probably the result of
using 5,8-ddf to elute the enzyme from the last affinity column during purification. this can be seen in the
spectrum of the enzyme in fig. 1 where some absorbance at 310 nm already exists in the purified enzyme.
this residual absorbance at 310 nm most certainly is
not at the catalytic site since our stoichiometry was
always close to 1 during cross-linking of the substrate

analog as calculated by the conversion of 10-cho-5,8ddf to 5,8-ddf (shown in the inset of fig. 1).
when tritiated 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate was added
to ftd and the bound and unbound ligands were separated by chromatography on p6-dg, we found close to
one 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate bound per subunit of
ftd. the activity of this preparation was the same as
enzyme isolated without bound ligand, again confirming our earlier studies that the tightly bound folate
does not affect the catalytic site.
the location of this tightly bound 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate was assessed by digesting the ftd z 5,8-ddf–
tetraglutamate noncovalent complex with subtilisin,
which is known to cleave the protein into an n-terminal small domain and a larger c-terminal domain (1).
the two domains were separated by chromatography
on a tmae column and identified by size on an sds–
page gel (fig. 4). from a spectral analysis of the two
fractions it was conclusive that the small domain contained the tightly bound 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate
(data not shown). this suggests that both the catalytic
and tight binding folate sites are on the small domain.
stability of the ftd-h 4pteglu 4 complex. the observation that occupation of the folate tight binding site
on ftd with either 5,8-ddf–tetraglutamate or
h 4pteglu 4 does not alter catalytic activity suggests
that this site is not an allosteric regulatory site. this
raises the issue of the function of the tight binding site.
the observation that the concentration of ftd subunits in liver cells exceeds by severalfold the concen-

165

tration of h 4pteglu n suggests that the tight binding
site could serve as a storage form of the coenzyme, to be
released when the cell needs additional h 4pteglu n (3).
this would make sense if the tightly bound h 4pteglu n
was more stable to oxidation than free h 4pteglu n. we
have previously shown that h 4pteglu 5 bound to rabbit
cytosolic shmt has increased stability and others
have shown that the glycine cleavage system of pea
mitochondria also stabilizes h 4pteglu 5 (18, 19). we
incubated ftd with h 4pteglu 4 and separated bound
and unbound ligands by chromatography on a p6-dg
column. an equivalent amount of h 4pteglu was added
to the same buffer but lacking any ftd. the stability
of the ftd-bound h 4pteglu 4 was compared to that of
the unbound h 4pteglu by withdrawing aliquots and
assaying for remaining h 4pteglu n. figure 5 shows that
over a 6-h period there was about a 10% loss in ftdbound h 4  xxxd2146xxx  4 while the unbound h 4  xxxd2146xxx  decreased by 90%, even though it contained some 2- xxxd26xxx  and ascorbate. this is a dramatic demonstration that the tight binding site on ftd protects
h 4pteglu n from oxidative degradation.
discussion

the presence of a folate tight binding site on ftd
that is separate from the catalytic site has been presumed because when h 4pteglu n is tightly bound the

enzyme retains its full catalytic activity (3). the results
of this study support the interpretation that ftd contains two h 4pteglu n binding sites on the small domain.
one is a catalytic site and another is a noncatalytic
tight binding site that can be occupied even when the
catalytic site is blocked by being cross-linked to the
product analog 5,8-ddf. our studies further support
our previous observation that tight binding of
h 4pteglu n may not take place when the catalytic site is
occupied by the substrate 10-cho-h 4pteglu n (3). the
conversion of cross-linked 10-cho-5,8-ddf to
5,8-ddf promotes the binding of tritium-labeled 5,8ddf–tetraglutamate to the tight binding site. this
suggests that a conformational change is involved in
the conversion of substrate to product that increases
affinity for h 4pteglu n at the tight binding site. what is
not clear is if h 4pteglu n formed at the catalytic site
must dissociate before being rebound at the tight binding site.
previous investigators had provided evidence that
two molecules of 5-cho-h 4  xxxd2146xxx  n could be crosslinked to rat liver ftd with subsequent loss of catalytic activity (4). we repeated these studies with our
rabbit liver ftd and found no evidence that 5-choh 4pteglu n either inhibited ftd or was cross-linked to
the enzyme under a variety of experimental conditions.
we conclude that 5-cho-h 4pteglu does not bind to
rabbit liver ftd.
there now appears to be at least two functions for
ftd in liver. one is to regulate the ratio of 10-choh 4pteglu n to h 4pteglu n and the other to serve as a
storage reservoir for h 4pteglu n. a mouse strain that is
lacking ftd activity shows a higher than normal ratio
of 10-cho-h 4  xxxd2146xxx  n /h 4  xxxd2146xxx  n in liver tissue, in
agreement that ftd regulates the availability of
h 4pteglu n (20). except for some sexual dysfunction the
ftd-deficient mice survive in a nearly normal state.
this role in regulation does not explain the need for
large amounts of ftd in the liver. the observation that
the concentration of ftd in liver exceeds by severalfold
the pool of h 4pteglu n and its ability to protect the
coenzyme from oxidative degradation at its tight binding site supports a role for storing excess h 4pteglu n.

this could be tested by limiting the folate intake of the
ftd-deficient mice and determining the ability of the
liver to maintain folate homeostasis and normal function in purine, thymidylate, and s-adenosyl methionine biosynthesis.
