[racemation of the benzodiazepines camazepam and  xxxd2420xxx  and receptor binding of enantiomers].  the chiral benzodiazepines camazepam (1) and  xxxd2420xxx  (2) were resolved into the enantiomers by chromatography on the optically active adsorbent poly[(s)-n-(1-cyclohexylethyl)-methacrylamide] and fractional crystallisation or repeated chromatography, respectively. the ic50 values of the isomers and of the racemates of both compounds were determined by displacement of radioactively labelled 3h-flunitrazepam and 3h-propyl-beta-carboline-carboxylate from their specific binding sites. (+)-camazepam exhibits 14fold higher affinity compared to the (-)-enantiomer. in contrast only slight differences in the receptor affinity are observed with the  xxxd2420xxx  enantiomers.
