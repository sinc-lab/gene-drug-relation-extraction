abstract recent clinical studies on patients with malignancies, who were treated with uhf and lmwhs raised
the possibility, that these agents may possess an inhibitory
effect on tumor progression. further studies supported that
this effect is independent from the anticoagulant and
antithrombotic action. in this retrospective study oncological patients with an increased risk for thromboembolism
were choosen, who received prophylactic treatment with an
lmwh ( xxxd2690xxx ) at least for 6 months. comparing with
the control group, in some subgroups (t3 and t4, as well as
m1) the lmwh-treated patients showed a significantly
increased survival.

introduction
it is well established that malignant tumors are frequently
accompanied by an increased risk for thromboembolism. to
prevent this complication many patients receive anticoagulant prophylaxis, moreover, recent guidelines emphasize
the importance of extended prophylaxis. experimental and
clinical data suggest that the administration of lmwh (low
molecular weight heparin) to oncological patients influences the progression of the disease decreasing the risk for
hematogenous metastases [1–6].
the clinical use of lmwhs is simple, safe and
convenient. the drug is administered s.c. once a day in a
dose adjusted to the body mass of the patient. the
advantage of the lmwhs vs. unfractionated heparin
(ufh) is the unnecessity of regular laboratory controll
and the possibility of self-treatment at home [7].
in randomized clinical studies the effect of ufh and
lmwhs was compared, and the tumorous patients treated
with lmwh had a prolonged life-time in average of
3 months vs. to that treated with ufh [8]. since the
occurrence of thrombosis and the bleeding complications
were almost identical in both groups, these results
suggested that lmwhs may have antitumor activity,
besides and independently from their anticogulant effect.
the anticoagulant effect of ufh and lmwhs is due to
the increase of rate of complex formation of the physiological inhibitors of coagulation, i.e.  xxxg2056xxx  and
the activated clotting enzymes (mainly thrombin and xa),
by several thousands. out of the binding of heparins to
antithrombin, due to their strong negative charge, they may
bind to numerous regulatory molecules, modifying their
activity as well [9]. these interactions depend on the
special physicochemical characteristics of heparin-chains

and fragments resulting in a large variety of other biological
effects next to anticoagulation. the antiproliferative effect
of heparins and its derivatives on the malignant cell lines is
achieved by the inhibition of the protein kinase cdependent signaling pathway activating transcription factors
as cfos and cmyc [10]. the immunomodulatory effect of
heparins and their derivatives could be the consequence of
the decreased adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells,
and the same mechanism could work against the extravasation of the tumor cells. heparins also exert an antiangiogenic
effect with the modulation/inhibition of the angiogenic
growth factors and their antagonists. as the ufh and the
high molecular weigh fragments enhance the binding of the
angiogenic growth factors to their receptors, the lmwhs
and the small fragments inhibit this binding. furthermore,
heparins modulate other mechanisms of the angiogenesis as
well (fibrin formation, migration of endothelial cells, matrix
degradation by endothelial cell [11].
the migration of the cells has an important role in the
formation of metastases and angiogenesis. some heparins
are able to modulate several steps of invasion by inhibiting
the adhesion of the cells to the proteins of the extracellular
matrix and also by inhibiting the activity of different
proteolytic enzymes, they may modulate the invasion as

well [9]. the thrombin generation is important regarding
the protection of the circulating malignant cells. without
defending fibrin network the tumor cells become vulnerable
and the intravascular arrest and extravasation will be less
successful or inhibited [10–12].
the main aim of our study was to follow the survival of
the oncologic patients having solid tumors, while treating
them with  xxxd2690xxx . the malignant tumors were in
different stages at the start of the treatment. the patients
in the lmwh-treated and in the control groups were
monitored at the 6-monthly repeated visits.

methods
patients, selected for this retrospective, open-labeled study,
were treated and monitored for solid tumors (almost
exclusively colonic or breast cancer) in the clinical
oncology department of st. imre hospital, budapest. the
treated group of the patients (96 patients—62 breast cancer,
29 colorectal cancer and 5 ovarian cancer) had a demonstrable higher risk for thrombosis with activated clotting
system and required long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. each patient subscribed an informed consent and

agreed that instead of oral anticoagulation they receive
 xxxd2690xxx  (partly by sanofi-aventis, partly by glaxosmith
kline) during and between the cycles of chemotherapy for at
least 6 months. patients received various chemotherapeutic
protocols: fec (5-fluorouracil,  xxxd2008xxx ,  xxxd1779xxx )
for breast cancer, mainly de gramont (5-fluorouracil,  xxxd2462xxx ) for colorectal cancer and paclitaxel plus carboplatin for
ovarian cancer.  xxxd2690xxx  was given according to the
protocol, briefly: <50 kg 0.2 ml/three postop days, daily/
0.3 ml thereafter, 50–69 kg 0.3 ml/0.4 ml, and >70 kg 0.4 ml/
0.6 ml.the patients were educated for s.c. self-administration
of lmwh. the control group (68 patients) did not receive
anticoagulant. patients were monitored by imaging techniques, and by tumor markers during the 6 monthly visits. at
the time of the first clinical examination none of the patients
showed sign or symptom of cns metastasis or deep venous
thrombosis (dvt).
the primary aim of the study was to determine the
progression free and survival time of the patients (the
interval between the time of diagnosis of the tumor and
the death of the patients or the time of the last control). the
survival times were calculated in function of tnm staging.
the differences were estimated with a kaplan-meier
survival analysis, the significance of results were controlled
by logrank, tarone-ware and breslow tests. we used spss
15.0 program package to the data management and
statistics.

both groups contained cases either in m0 or in m1
stage. as a suprise, those patients, who had metastases at
the time of diagnosis did much better when received
lmwh prophylaxis (table 2). the frequency of thrombosis or severe bleeding were similar is these groups.
the kaplan-meier analysis of survival were performed
on each variations of tnm staging, but reasonable number
(still very low) of patients were only in t3n0m1 and in
t3n1m1 groups. data from this comparison showed again
that the mean and median values of the survival was longer
after lmwh treatment (table 3).
the starting clinical state was determined at the time of
the diagnosis. the average follow-up was 4.9 years. the
changes in the clinical status of the patients—regression,
progression, or steady state—were evaluated using imaging
techniques and the levels of tumor markers (table 4). at the
end of the evaluation period (which was the time of the last
visit or the death of the patient) progression was observed
in 32.3% of the lmwh-treated patients, whereas it was
50.7% in the control group. the interval until the
appearence of progression (progression free survival, pfs)
was 35 months in average in the lmwh group, whereas
26 months in the control. regression (total tumor burden
was decreased by more than 25%) was observed in 12.5%
of the lmwh treated group, while only in 3.1% in the
control group. the duration of regression (which reflects
the observation period) was 34 months in average in the
lmwh-treated group and 17 months in the control. no

table 1 shows that the lmwh treatment increased the odds
for increased survival in t3 and t4 stages. in order to
enforce the differences we performed the logrank, taroneware and breslow probes. on that basis we can state that
the distribution of the survival times in cases of t3 and t4
significantly differ in the lmwh-treated and control
groups. next, the two groups were compared at n stage
level, but the results did not show any differences.

discussion
references
this study performed with the enrollment of 164 patients
retrospectively was a “pilot” one, where we studied the
effect of lmwh (here  xxxd2690xxx ) on the survival of
patients with malignancies and risk for dvt. it is important
to emphasize that neither thromboembolic nor severe
bleeding complications were observed.
according to our observations the odds of longer
survival was higher in the lmwh-treated group in t3
and t4 and in m1 stages. the analysis of the n stages
showed no difference between the two clinical groups.
the finding that the probability for longer survival was
significantly better for patients who already had metastasis is
somewhat contradictory to some previous studies [5, 6],
which found a longer survival in patients with a better
prognosis. however, the suggested and observed antitumor
effect of continuous  xxxd2690xxx  treatment could be more
effective in patients with primary and metastatic tumor,
because more steps of progression are provided as targets for
lmwh action. (in that case malignant cells can be released
into the circulation from any tumorous foci and an attack on
angiogenesis is also feasible.) in case of no metastasis
(which has definitely better prognosis) the therapeutic
window for lmwh is much narrower. this can explain
why the antitumor effect was missed in the m0 group.
the beneficial effect of  xxxd2690xxx  was obvious at the
end of the observation period, i.e. at the time of the last
control. more regression and less progression happened in
the lmwh-treated group. although, these results support
those views which are in favour of the antitumor effect of
lmwh, and even trying to develop lmwh or ulmwh
agents with less antithrombotic and more powerful anticancer activity [13], our pilot study has been performed on a
mixed oncological patient population. further prospective
