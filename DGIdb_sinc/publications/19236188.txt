conclusion

10. expert opinion

 xxxd2513xxx  is a bicyclic fatty acid metabolite analogue of  xxxd124xxx .
the fda has approved  xxxd2513xxx  for the treatment of chronic
constipation in men and women and the treatment of women with
irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c).  xxxd2513xxx  specifically
activates type-2-chloride channels on the apical membrane of epithelial
cells.  xxxd2513xxx  acts locally within the intestinal tract, is rapidly
metabolized and has very low systemic bioavailability. animal studies
have demonstrated that  xxxd2513xxx  increases gastrointestinal fluid
secretion in a dose-dependent manner. clinical studies performed in men
and women with chronic constipation using 24 µg of  xxxd2513xxx 
twice-daily demonstrated objective improvement in stool frequency
and consistency, as well as symptoms of straining and incomplete
evacuation. a multi-center study of patients with ibs-c found that 8 µg
of  xxxd2513xxx  twice-daily improved both global and individual symptoms
of irritable bowel syndrome.  xxxd2513xxx  is generally well tolerated and
serious adverse events are rare. the most common reported side effects
are nausea, headache and diarrhea. this monograph provides a brief
overview on chloride channel function in the gastrointestinal tract, describes
the structure, function, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2513xxx , and
discusses the safety and efficacy of this new medication for the treatment
of chronic constipation and ibs-c.

introduction

 xxxd2513xxx  ( xxxd2513xxx , sucampo pharmaceuticals, bethesda, md, usa), a
type-2-chloride channel (clc) activator, was approved by the fda for the
treatment of chronic constipation in men and women (24 µg twice-daily) on
31 january 2006. the fda subsequently approved  xxxd2513xxx , at a dose of
8 µg twice-daily, for the treatment of women who have irritable bowel syndrome
with constipation (ibs-c) on 29 april 2008.
chronic constipation and ibs-c are two of the most common functional
bowel disorders encountered by primary care providers and gastroenterologists.
the prevalence of constipation in the us is ∼ 15%, with women, the elderly,
non-caucasians and patients in lower socioeconomic classes more likely to be
affected [1,2]. chronic constipation markedly affects patients’ quality of life and
imposes a significant economic burden to the health care system. several studies
have shown that patients with chronic constipation note a reduction in quality
of life in several areas, including both physical and psychological domains [3,4].

the annual cost of evaluating and treating patients
with chronic constipation in the us is estimated to be
> $7 billion [4]. this figure includes indirect costs
attributed to missing school or work and being less
productive at school or work, as well as the direct costs
of treating constipation (e.g., office visits, diagnostic tests
and medications). although the natural history of chronic
constipation is not as well studied as other functional
bowel disorders, most patients with chronic constipation
remain symptomatic when surveyed 18 – 20 months after
initial evaluation [5].
irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is also frequently
encountered by all types of health care providers, and
prevalence in the us is estimated to be 9 – 22% [6-8].
similar to chronic constipation, women are more likely
than men to be diagnosed with ibs [6-8]. in addition, ibs
imposes a significant burden on both patients and society.
patients with ibs suffer from a dramatic reduction in
quality of life [9] and conservative estimates are that
annual us health care costs for the evaluation and treatment
of ibs exceed $20 billion [10]. on average, health care costs
for ibs patients are 50% higher than patients of similar
age and sex who do not have ibs [11].
the definition of constipation has evolved over the
past decade and at present is based on several different
symptoms rather than exclusively on stool frequency.
patients with constipation often describe a constellation
of symptoms that includes hard or lumpy stools,
infrequent stools, straining, feelings of incomplete
evacuation, and rectal or perianal fullness or discomfort.
the recently released rome iii criteria have attempted to
take these various symptoms into consideration (table 1).
pathophysiologically, constipation is generally classified
as either primary (e.g., colonic inertia, pelvic floor
dysfunction, normal transit constipation, ibs-c) or
secondary in nature (e.g., metabolic, endocrine, surgical,
psychiatric) (table 2) [12,13].
the definition of ibs has also changed considerably
over the past several decades. the rome iii criteria
define ibs as a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal
pain or discomfort associated with disordered defecation
(constipation, diarrhea, or mixed symptoms of alternating
constipation and diarrhea). symptoms should have developed at least 6 months before the patient first presents
for formal evaluation. abdominal pain or discomfort
should be present at least 3 days per month for 3 months
and should be associated with two or more of the following:
improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change
in stool frequency, and/or onset associated with a change
in stool form. according to the rome iii criteria, the
subgrouping of ibs patients is predicated on differences in
stool consistency (table 3) [12].
treating patients with chronic constipation and
ibs-c can be frustrating because symptoms do not
accurately reflect the underlying pathophysiology nor do
144

they predict response to treatment. life-style modifications
(e.g., drinking more water, exercising and adding
dietary fiber) are frequently recommended by health
care providers as the first step in therapy. although safe,
these treatments are usually ineffective except in patients
who are fiber deficient [14,15]. over-the-counter medications
are generally used next, and these include bulk laxatives
(e.g., psyllium), osmotic laxatives (e.g.,  xxxd2531xxx ),
emollients (e.g., docusate sodium) and stimulant laxatives
(e.g., cascara). although some patients note an improvement
in symptoms, there is little evidence to support the longterm efficacy of these agents [13]. patients with persistent
symptoms despite this step-wise approach generally seek out
medical consultation. after an appropriate evaluation has
been performed, medical therapy is usually recommended,
which may include osmotic agents (e.g.,  xxxd2982xxx ,
lactulose) or a type-2-clc activator (e.g.,  xxxd2513xxx ). the
safety and efficacy of osmotic agents have been carefully
reviewed in two recent monographs and will not be
discussed further [13,16]. the remainder of this review
focuses on  xxxd2513xxx .

clcs

clcs are located throughout the body in virtually all cell
types, including epithelial, nerve and muscle cells, where
they play a critical role in normal cellular function [17].
they are pore forming proteins that allow the transport of
chloride ions, the predominant anion in the extracellular
fluid, across cell membranes.
in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, a number of
different clcs play a critical role in fluid transport,
depolarization of smooth muscle cells, postsynaptic
transmission, and the maintenance of both cell volume
and intracellular ph [18]. at present, nine separate clcs
have been identified (clc-0 – clc7,  xxxg473xxx  and clc-kb).
one of the most important clcs is the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator. genetic defects in
 xxxg437xxx  may
lead to the development of cystic fibrosis symptoms owing
to defective cl- uptake into cells with resultant increased
viscosity of secretions and mucus impaction [18]. this review
focuses on the  xxxg472xxx  channel, as this is the clc selectively
activated by  xxxd2513xxx .
the  xxxg472xxx  channel is distributed throughout the gi
tract, including the stomach, small intestine and colon.
it is an alpha-helical transmembrane protein that is highly
selective for cl- and is not permeable to larger anions
or to cations [19]. essential functions of the  xxxg472xxx  channel
include fluid transport and secretion, regulating cell volume
and ph, and maintaining the membrane potential of
the cell [17-19].  xxxg472xxx  channels are localized to the apical
(luminal) cell membrane in human intestine [20]. activation
of  xxxg472xxx  is probably regulated by second messenger
induced phosphorylation.

pharmacology of  xxxd2513xxx 

3.1

structure

the formal chemical name of  xxxd2513xxx  is difluoropentyl2-hydroxy-6-oxooctahydrocyclopenta- xxxd2269xxx  [21]. it
is a white, odorless crystal and powder that is soluble in
ethanol but insoluble in water.  xxxd2513xxx  is classified as
a prostone, a bicyclic fatty acid compound derived from a
metabolite of  xxxd124xxx .  xxxd2513xxx  can tautomerize
between two different forms:  xxxd2513xxx  ii is the
active form (figure 1).

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

table 3. rome iii criteria for ibs (modified from [12]).

the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2513xxx  were
evaluated in a study of fasted healthy male volunteers [21].
after ingesting a 72 µg dose of radio-labeled  xxxd2513xxx ,
60% of the radio-label was recovered in the urine in 24 h,
63% was recovered in the urine by day 7 and 30% was
recovered in the stool at the end of 1 week.  xxxd2513xxx 
could not be detected in plasma, urine or stool, and
it is thought that the measured radioactivity represents
a compound labeled as m3, which is the active
metabolite of  xxxd2513xxx . peak plasma levels occur ∼ 1.14 h
after oral administration of a single 24 µg dose, and
the half-life of  xxxd2513xxx  (t½) has been estimated
at ∼ 3 h [21].
 xxxd2513xxx  is metabolized within the gi tract
through microsomal carbonyl reductase; the cytochrome
p450 system is not involved. in contrast to the parent drug,
m3 is absorbed and ∼ 94% is bound to human plasma
proteins. the half-life of m3 is ∼ 0.9 – 1.4 h. although not
tested in large studies, gender does not seem to influence
the metabolism of  xxxd2513xxx . no studies have been
conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of
 xxxd2513xxx  in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
studies are in progress to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd2513xxx  in the pediatric population. in summary,
 xxxd2513xxx  seems to act locally within the gi tract, has
a fairly quick onset of action and is rapidly metabolized
on the apical (luminal) surface of epithelial cells.

symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis

3.3

presence of symptoms for the past 3 months (see below)

 xxxd2513xxx  specifically activates  xxxg472xxx  channels on
the apical membrane of epithelial cells [20,22,23]. highly
specific inhibitors of  xxxg472xxx  channels are not available,
and thus blocking experiments cannot be performed.
activation of  xxxg472xxx  channels causes an efflux of
chloride into the lumen of the gi tract, followed
by an efflux of sodium ions to maintain isoelectric
neutrality. sodium efflux occurs through a paracellular
pathway and not through the apical membrane. water
then follows sodium along the paracellular pathway to
maintain isotonic equilibrium. animal studies have
demonstrated that  xxxd2513xxx  increases intestinal fluid
secretion in a dose-dependent manner [24].

figure 1. structure of  xxxd2513xxx .

because  xxxd2513xxx  is a metabolite of  xxxd124xxx ,
researchers have investigated whether  xxxd2513xxx  can
directly stimulate smooth muscle, possibly through
prostaglandin receptors. two separate animal studies have
not shown any evidence of a direct stimulatory effect of
 xxxd2513xxx  on gi smooth muscle [25,26]. cuppoletti et al.,
using cultured human uterine smooth muscle cells,
found that  xxxd2513xxx  decreased calcium levels, did not
change camp levels and caused hyperpolarization of the
cells [26]. these effects were directly opposite to those of
prostaglandins e1 and e2, which caused an increase in
both calcium and camp, and depolarization of the muscle
cells. however, a recent study by bassil et al. found
that  xxxd2513xxx  induced contraction of rat and human
stomach longitudinal muscle, but inhibited electrical
field stimulated contractions of colonic circular smooth
muscle [27]. the stimulatory effects of  xxxd2513xxx  on
longitudinal muscle were blocked by a prostaglandin ep1
receptor antagonist, whereas the inhibition of circular
smooth muscle was reduced by a prostaglandin  xxxg1875xxx 
antagonist. these findings raise the possibility that
 xxxd2513xxx ’s actions may not be entirely due to activation
of the  xxxg472xxx  channels.
in summary,  xxxd2513xxx  stimulates  xxxg472xxx  channels
and promotes intestinal fluid secretion. although the
final details of  xxxd2513xxx ’s mechanism of action are
still lacking with regard to improvement in symptoms
of constipation, one theory is that the secretion of fluids
into the gi tract promotes increased transit through the
small intestine and colon, possibly through stimulation
of local receptors sensitive to stretch and distention [28,29].
the direct effects of  xxxd2513xxx  on smooth muscle
are unclear given contradictory results. further studies are
required to determine the extent of direct smooth muscle
activation by  xxxd2513xxx .

effects on reproduction and development

animal studies have not shown evidence of a direct
teratogenic effect of  xxxd2513xxx  [21,30]. more specifically,
when rats received 332 times the standard human dose or
146

rabbits received 33 times the standard human dose,
no teratogenic effects were noted. however,  xxxd2513xxx 
administered at 6 – 10 times the recommended dose
to guinea pigs was associated with an increase in the rate
of fetal loss. this was thought to be the result of
significant weight loss in the pregnant animals, rather than a
direct effect on the fetus [21,30]. fetal loss did not occur in
similarly designed experiments involving mice and rats.
owing to the adverse effects observed in the guinea pig
model, however, and the lack of well-controlled studies
in pregnant women, the fda has rated  xxxd2513xxx  as
pregnancy category “c”.

clinical studies in chronic constipation

5.1

randomized controlled trials

the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  were evaluated in a
multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging
study of 129 subjects with symptoms of chronic
constipation [31]. constipation was defined as fewer
than three spontaneous bowel movements (sbm) a week,
together with one or more of the following symptoms
occurring at least 25% of the time: hard stools, straining
or feelings of incomplete evacuation. after a 2-week
washout period, patients who had a minimum of 6 months
of symptoms were randomized to receive either  xxxd2513xxx 
(24, 48 or 72 µg/day) or placebo for three consecutive
weeks. all patients underwent either a colonoscopy or a
flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema to exclude an
organic cause for their symptoms. the patients were
predominantly female (≥ 84% in each treatment arm) and
caucasian (≥ 81% in each treatment arm). the mean
age was 48.3 years; 10% were at least 65 years of age.
using a modified intention to treat analysis, patients in
the treatment groups were found to have a significant
increase in the average number of weekly sbms during the
first (p = 0.006) and second week of the study (p = 0.014),
and over the entire study period (p = 0.046) when
compared to placebo, although no difference was noted
at week 3 (p = 0.298). each of the three treatment
arms showed significant improvement in sbm frequency at

lacy & chey

week 2 of the study compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.020),
but only the 48 µg treatment group showed a statistically
significant improvement over the entire treatment period
(p = 0.015). a larger percentage of patients in each
treatment arm had an sbm in 24 h of initial dosing
of  xxxd2513xxx  compared to placebo; the difference for
the two highest dosing groups was statistically significant
(placebo group = 27.3%; 48 µg = 59.4%, p = 0.009;
72 µg = 63.6%, p = 0.003). several measures of constipation were assessed each week during the trial period using
4- and 5-point scales. the  xxxd2513xxx  treatment group
experienced a statistically significant improvement over
the entire treatment period when compared to baseline in
the mean degree of straining (p < 0.005), stool consistency
(p < 0.0001), abdominal bloating (p = 0.035), severity of
constipation (p = 0.010) and overall rating of treatment
effectiveness (p = 0.045). abdominal discomfort and
bloating improved but did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.136). finally, no differences were noted between
the groups with regard to the use of rescue medications
(bisacodyl pills or sodium phosphate enemas).
during this 3-week study, no significant differences
were found between the two groups with regard to vital
signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms (ecg) or
blood work (complete blood count, electrolytes, blood
urea nitrogen/creatinine, glucose). there were no drugrelated serious adverse events during the trial. sixty-nine
percent of patients in the  xxxd2513xxx  group experienced
at least one adverse event compared to 39% of patients
taking placebo (p = 0.006). twelve (9%) patients reported
adverse events of severe intensity. of these events, ten
were experienced by more than one patient and included:
headache (two patients in the 72 µg arm), diarrhea
(four patients in the 72 µg arm), abdominal pain
(one patient in the placebo arm and one patient in the
48 µg group), and nausea (one patient in each of the
 xxxd2513xxx  48 and 72 µg groups). overall, nausea was
the most common adverse event reported by 31% of patients
taking  xxxd2513xxx  but none taking placebo. most
patients rated the nausea as mild or moderate in nature.
four percent of study patients discontinued the study
because of nausea. diarrhea occurred in ∼ 10% of patients
taking  xxxd2513xxx  but none taking placebo.
the results of two separate phase iii multi-center
trials reinforce the findings of the initial dose-ranging
study [32,33]. patients were classified as having symptoms
of chronic constipation using modified rome ii criteria
as previously described [31]. the first study involved
242 subjects (mean age = 48.6 years; 90% women; > 84%
caucasian) from 20 centers across the us [32]. patients were
randomized to twice-daily  xxxd2513xxx  (24 µg) or placebo
taken with food after a 2-week baseline period. prescription
and over-the-counter constipation remedies were prohibited
during the washout and study periods, although bisacodyl
suppositories or sodium phosphate enemas were available

as ‘rescue’ therapy for those subjects without a bowel
movement for three or more consecutive days. compared
to placebo, the treatment group had more sbms during
week 1 (5.7 versus 3.5, p = 0.0001), and the effect was
sustained during each of the subsequent weeks of the
study. a larger percentage of patients on  xxxd2513xxx  had
an sbm in 24 h (56.7 versus 36.9%, p = 0.0024) and in
48 h (80.0 versus 60.7%, p = 0.0013). the need for rescue
medications was similar in both groups at baseline but
decreased in the  xxxd2513xxx  group by the end of the
study period (35.6 versus 50.8%, p = 0.0357). symptom
scores were significantly improved with  xxxd2513xxx 
compared to placebo for weeks 1 – 4 for stool consistency
(p < 0.0001), straining (p ≤ 0.0001) and constipation
severity (p ≤ 0.0003). abdominal bloating was improved
in the  xxxd2513xxx  treated group compared to placebo
during weeks 1 – 2 (p ≤ 0.031), whereas abdominal
discomfort scores were significantly improved for weeks
2 – 4 (p ≤ 0.045). seventy percent of subjects on  xxxd2513xxx  reported at least one adverse event compared to 50.8%
of patients on placebo (p = 0.0026). the most common
treatment-related adverse event was nausea, occurring
in 31.7% of the  xxxd2513xxx  group and 3.3% of the
placebo group (p < 0.001). five percent of patients
discontinued the study due to nausea.
the second phase iii trial included 237 subjects
(mean age = 45.8 years; 88% women) [33]. patients on
 xxxd2513xxx  experienced significant improvement in the
frequency of weekly bowel movements (5.9 versus 4.00,
p < 0.0001). similar to the previously described studies,
patients on  xxxd2513xxx  reported improvements in
subjective measures of constipation, and more patients
experienced an sbm in the first 24 h in the  xxxd2513xxx 
group than the placebo group (61 versus 31%, p < 0.0001).
nausea, headache and diarrhea were again the most
commonly reported adverse effects. mild to moderate nausea
occurred more frequently in the  xxxd2513xxx  treated group
than in the placebo group in the second study (21 versus
4.2%; p-value not reported) [34]. no serious adverse
events were reported; fifteen  xxxd2513xxx  patients
withdrew from the second trial.
sudden cessation of a medication may result in a
worsening of symptoms above baseline, a phenomena
referred to as a ‘rebound effect’. the potential for rebound
constipation developing following  xxxd2513xxx  withdrawal
was evaluated in 128 subjects (mean age and gender not
reported) with symptoms of chronic constipation treated
with  xxxd2513xxx  (24 µg) twice-daily for 4 weeks [35].
after the initial 4-week study period, subjects were then
randomized to receive three more weeks of  xxxd2513xxx  or
placebo. a rapid and sustained improvement in sbm
similar to that seen in the other trials was observed
(1.4 a week at baseline versus 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5 at weeks
1, 2 and 3, respectively; p < 0.0001 at all weeks).
three weeks after randomization to placebo or to

continued  xxxd2513xxx , the sbm frequency declined in the
placebo group (3.04 versus 5.59; p = 0.0464) but remained
improved compared to baseline (3.0 versus 1.4; p = 0.0223),
arguing against significant rebound constipation after
 xxxd2513xxx  withdrawal.

5.2

three large, open-label studies have been conducted to assess
the long-term efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  in the treatment of
chronic constipation. 308 patients were entered into one
24-week study, whereas another 572 patients were entered
into two separate 48-week trials. the severity of constipation, bloating and abdominal discomfort were periodically
assessed among all 880 patients [36]. statistically significant
improvements were reported for all symptoms throughout
the trial periods (p < 0.0001). constipation severity improved
in all three studies by an average of 26% at weeks 4 – 6
(n = 828), 29% at week 24 (n = 512) and 28% at week 48
(n = 281). bloating improved by an average of 18%
at weeks 4 – 6 (n = 829), and 20% at weeks 24 (n = 512)
and 48 (n = 282). abdominal discomfort improved by
an average of 15% at week 1 (n = 619), 18% at week 24
(n = 512) and 17% at week 48 (n = 282).
gender differences

5.3

women have accounted for most subjects in all of the
clinical trials of  xxxd2513xxx  performed until now. a
subgroup analysis of the 4-week controlled trials was
performed to evaluate efficacy in men [37]. pooled data
yielded 27 male placebo subjects and 32  xxxd2513xxx 
subjects. male subjects taking  xxxd2513xxx  experienced
5.69 – 6.05 sbms a week compared to 2.55 – 3.23 in the
placebo group (p < 0.0489 at week 3, p = 0.0503 at
week 4). these rates were higher compared to females in
the trials (4.99 – 5.75 sbm/week). fifty percent of male
subjects taking  xxxd2513xxx  experienced at least one
side effect compared to 33.3% of men taking placebo
(exact details of adverse effects were not reported).
6.

ibs with constipation

the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  in the treatment
of ibs-c was first evaluated in a multi-center, doubleblind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study involving
195 patients [38]. patients who met rome iii criteria for
ibs-c were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with
either placebo or one of three different doses of  xxxd2513xxx 
(8, 16 or 24 µg b.i.d.) after a 4-week screening period.
the primary end point was the change in abdominal
pain/discomfort during the first 4 weeks of therapy.
secondary end points included the frequency of sbm, stool
consistency, straining at stool and abdominal bloating.
laboratory tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, blood
urea nitrogen/creatinine, glucose), ekgs, symptom diaries
and ibs-quality of life scores were monitored throughout
148

the study. most patients were women (92%) and caucasian
(83%). at 1 and 2 months, patients treated with any
dose of  xxxd2513xxx  had a greater improvement in mean
abdominal pain and discomfort scores compared to placebo
(p = 0.023 and 0.039, respectively). at 3 months, there was
no difference in the response rates for abdominal pain and
discomfort in patients treated with  xxxd2513xxx  compared
to placebo. as well, symptoms of bloating were not improved.
a greater number of adverse events were noted with
the higher doses of  xxxd2513xxx . patients treated with the
24 µg b.i.d. dose of  xxxd2513xxx  had the greatest improvement
in symptoms; however, they also had the greatest number
of adverse events. although not the focus of this study,
ibs quality of life scores were not statistically better in the
 xxxd2513xxx  group compared to the placebo group,
although this dose-ranging study was not powered to
accurately measure changes in quality of life scores. overall,
the authors concluded that the 8 µg twice-daily dose
provided the best combination of efficacy and safety.
the results of two separate phase iii studies evaluating
the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  in patients with ibs
and constipation were recently published in an abstract
form [39]. these two studies enrolled 1171 adults diagnosed
with ibs-c using the rome ii criteria and randomized
them to receive either 12 weeks of b.i.d.  xxxd2513xxx  (8 µg)
or placebo dosed with food. most patients were women
(91.6%), and were between the ages of 18 and 65 (91.7%).
the primary efficacy variable was a global question rating
overall ibs symptoms, whereas a 7-point balanced scale
was used to rate changes in individual symptoms. patients
reporting at least moderate relief for 4 out of 4 weeks or
patients reporting significant relief 2 out of 4 weeks were
considered monthly responders, and patients had to be a
monthly responder for at least 2 out of the 3 months to
qualify as an overall responder (table 4). the authors
reported that patients receiving  xxxd2513xxx  were nearly
twice as likely as those receiving placebo to achieve overall
response (17.9 versus 10.1%; p = 0.001). secondary end
points including abdominal pain, bloating, straining, stool
consistency and constipation were all significantly improved
in the  xxxd2513xxx  group compared to the placebo group
(p < 0.05 for all end points).  xxxd2513xxx  was generally
well tolerated. the most common treatment-related side
effects were nausea (8 versus 4% in placebo) and diarrhea
(6 versus 4% in placebo). of note, it is thought that the
low placebo rate in this study is due to the much stricter
standards for determining whether a patient is classified as a
responder. in addition, the lower dose (8 µg) was chosen
based on previous dose-ranging studies and may reflect the
fact that patients with ibs often respond to medications at
lower doses than other patients.
patients who demonstrated > 70% study drug compliance
during the 12-week blinded trial were invited to participate
in a 36-week open-label extension study [40]. the primary
end point was the same as used in the phase iii trials.

a total of 476 patients received 8 µg b.i.d.  xxxd2513xxx 
during the extension trial. patients initially treated with
placebo noted an increase in response from 8 to 31%,
whereas those treated with  xxxd2513xxx  noted a further
increase in response from 15 to 37%. no serious
adverse events were recorded, although nausea (3.5%)
and diarrhea (4.8%) were the most common reported
adverse events. further trials are planned to assess the
long-term benefits of  xxxd2513xxx  in patients who have ibs
with constipation.
7.

adverse effects and safety

a study of 26 healthy volunteers was designed to evaluate
the safety and tolerability of  xxxd2513xxx  [41]. subjects
in each group received either placebo or one of three
doses of  xxxd2513xxx  (72, 90 or 108 µg divided into three
daily doses). the subjects were monitored closely for 7 days

without any changes in ecgs, laboratory testing or vital
signs. there were no serious adverse events. two subjects
who withdrew from the study did so voluntarily and had no
adverse events. almost all of the adverse events consisted of
gi symptoms including vomiting, nausea and abdominal
cramping. as expected, subjects receiving  xxxd2513xxx 
experienced more diarrhea than those on placebo. the effect
did not seem to be dose-dependent.
pooled data from previously mentioned studies,
including 258 patients from two blinded studies
and 858 patients from three open-label trials, were reviewed
for a change in serum electrolytes due to  xxxd2513xxx 
(24 µg b.i.d.) [42]. in the blinded and open-label trials,
10.5 and 18.6% of patients, respectively, were 65 years
of age or greater. there were no changes in electrolytes
observed over the treatment period, which ranged from
12 to 48 weeks.
ecg changes due to  xxxd2513xxx  were evaluated
in 177 patients with chronic constipation and 68 healthy
male and female volunteers (age was not reported) [43].
ecgs before and after a single dose of 24 µg  xxxd2513xxx 
or a supratherapeutic dose of 144 µg did not show
any changes.
analysis of post-marketing data found that some patients
taking  xxxd2513xxx  experienced dyspnea within an hour of the
first dose. this generally resolved spontaneously in 2 – 3 h,
without any long term adverse effects. patients should be
cautioned to stop  xxxd2513xxx  if this occurs and not restart
it until evaluated by a knowledgeable health care provider.
the exact mechanism by which  xxxd2513xxx  causes dyspnea
is not known at present.
in summary,  xxxd2513xxx  seems to be safe with few
serious adverse events. as previously noted, the most
common adverse events are nausea, headache and diarrhea.
nausea and diarrhea seem to be dose-dependent. we do not
recommend using  xxxd2513xxx  during pregnancy due to the
lack of human reproductive data, and the manufacturers
have recommended using  xxxd2513xxx  during pregnancy
only if the benefits significantly outweigh potential risks.
before initiating therapy, a pregnancy test should be checked
in all women of child-bearing age not using a reliable form
of birth control. as noted above,  xxxd2513xxx  is pregnancy
category “c.” given the limited data available, we also do
not recommend using  xxxd2513xxx  in women who are
breastfeeding (table 5).

opioid-induced constipation

constipation is a frequent side effect of opioid use.
studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2513xxx 
in opioid-induced constipation in humans have begun,
although data are not yet available.  xxxd2513xxx  does
seem to improve opioid-induced constipation in a mouse
model, however [44].

conclusion

it is important to note that  xxxd2513xxx  is at present the
only medication approved by the fda for the treatment of
women with ibs-c. clinicians who practice medicine using
an evidence-based approach should choose this as the
first therapeutic agent for women who have ibs and
constipation if they wish to treat the global symptoms
of ibs. in a similar light,  xxxd2513xxx  is one of only
three agents approved by the fda for the treatment
of chronic constipation [16]. owing to insurance regulations,
clinicians are generally not allowed to treat chronic constipation patients with  xxxd2513xxx  until they have failed
lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter agents such as
 xxxd2982xxx . data supporting the use of lactulose
as a first-line agent is considerably weaker than for
 xxxd2513xxx  and thus lactulose is not recommended as
a first-line agent.
10.

expert opinion

 xxxd2513xxx ’s route to fda approval has followed a pathway
similar to other recent drug treatments for chronic constipation
and ibs-c. a relatively small number of preclinical studies
identified a plausible mechanistic explanation for the benefit
of constipation-related complaints. this was followed by the
requisite toxicology, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
studies, culminating in large, randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trials. based on the available evidence, it is reasonable
to conclude that  xxxd2513xxx  should be added to the
short list of evidence-based pharmacotherapies for chronic
constipation and ibs-c.
although the evidence supports the efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx 
for some patients with chronic constipation and ibs-c, a
150

full understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these
benefits remains to be determined.  xxxd2513xxx ’s prosecretory
effects provide a plausible explanation for its beneficial
effects on constipation-associated symptoms. however,
the mechanistic explanation for  xxxd2513xxx ’s effect on
abdominal pain/discomfort in patients with ibs-c remains
unclear. the beneficial effects of  xxxd2513xxx  on abdominal
pain/discomfort are all the more intriguing given that the
effective dose in ibs-c is one-third of the effective dose in
chronic constipation. it is possible that the benefits for pain
are simply a byproduct of improving constipation-associated
symptoms such as stool frequency, stool consistency and
straining. alternatively, it is also possible that improvements
in abdominal pain/discomfort could be the consequence of
an effect on visceral sensation. abnormalities in intestinal
barrier function have been identified in some patients
with ibs. a recent study in pigs found that  xxxd2513xxx 
accelerated recovery of mucosal barrier function after
ischemic injury of the ileum [45]. it has been hypothesized
that a beneficial effect of  xxxd2513xxx  on intestinal barrier
function may provide a mechanistic explanation for the
improvement in abdominal pain in ibs-c patients. this
interesting, but very preliminary, data requires confirmation
and elaboration.
it is also intriguing to consider the potential consequences
of the fda’s approval of a lower dose of  xxxd2513xxx  for
ibs-c than for chronic constipation. the availability of the
8 µg dose provides clinicians with an effective treatment for
a subset of patients with ibs-c. in addition, the 8 µg dose
may prove useful for patients with chronic constipation
who cannot tolerate the 24 µg dose because of nausea
or diarrhea. unfortunately, recommending and approving
different doses of  xxxd2513xxx  for chronic constipation and
ibs-c will make it necessary for clinicians to distinguish
between patients with chronic constipation and ibs-c.
as longitudinal studies suggest that patients with functional
disorders sometimes migrate between diagnoses, the recommendation of different doses of  xxxd2513xxx  for these
two conditions may cause confusion for clinicians. given
the overlap between chronic constipation and ibs-c,
clinicians can consider two strategies when deciding on
the initial dose of  xxxd2513xxx . based on current product
labeling, it is recommended that 8 µg b.i.d. be started
in patients with ibs-c whereas 24 µg b.i.d. be used
in those with chronic constipation. alternatively, utilizing
the minimum dose in all patients followed by dose
escalation in nonresponders may decrease the chance of
developing significant side effects with  xxxd2513xxx . only
further studies and clinical experience will settle this
important question.
