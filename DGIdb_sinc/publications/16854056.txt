a series of dibenzodiazepine derivatives was synthesized to probe the binding site of the recently discovered
histamine  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ). optimization of the lead structure clozapine (2) resulted in (e)-7-chloro-11(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepine (7j), a potent  xxxg1081xxx  agonist ( xxxg1081xxx , pki ) 7.6). pharmacological data suggests that the series of nonimidazole compounds can be used to describe the orthosteric
binding site of the  xxxg1081xxx  because both 2 and 7j displace [3h]histamine in a competitive manner. furthermore,
it is demonstrated that the effects of 7j are competitively antagonized by the selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj
7777120 (1), indicating considerable overlap of their binding sites. on the basis of the derived structureactivity relationships and additional pharmacological results, a pharmacophore model was constructed, which
will be the premise for the design of novel  xxxg1081xxx  ligands.
introduction
histamine is an extensively studied biogenic amine that is
present in a variety of tissues. its physiological role is mediated
through the activation of four g-protein coupled receptors
(gpcrs) that significantly differ in location, (patho)physiology
and ligand binding. the histamine  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) has only
recently been discovered independently by several research
groups.1-5 this receptor is mainly expressed in eosinophils, t
cells, dendritic cells, basophils, and mast cells. the administration of selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist 1 (figure 1) inhibits the h4rmediated calcium influx and the chemotaxis of mast cells.6
furthermore, it has been shown that zymosan-induced neutrophil
recruitment from the bone marrow can be blocked by thioperamide, a potent  xxxd1422xxx  at both the  xxxg1081xxx  and  xxxg1080xxx 
subtypes.7 together with the reports on the role of histamine
as a leukocyte chemoattractant, these findings suggest an
important role for the  xxxg1081xxx  for the treatment of inflammatory
diseases such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and
several dermatological disorders.8-13 it has been suggested that
the  xxxg1081xxx  is involved in the histamine-induced itch, and  xxxg1081xxx 
antagonists could potentially lead to the first effective treatment
of pruritis.14,15
the human  xxxg1081xxx  is most closely related to the human  xxxg1080xxx .
the two proteins have a sequence identity of 31% overall and
54% in the transmembrane domains where the orthosteric
binding sites of the class a aminergic gpcrs are located. the
orthosteric binding site of the  xxxg1081xxx  is the site where its natural
ligand histamine binds. it is not surprising, therefore, that most
imidazole-containing ligands (agonists and antagonists) that have
been developed for the  xxxg1080xxx  also display considerable affinity
for the  xxxg1081xxx .13,16 remarkably, the more recently developed
nonimidazole  xxxg1080xxx  inverse agonists and antagonists, compounds
that have a high clincial potential in  xxxg1080xxx -mediated diseases,
all lack  xxxg1081xxx  affinity.17
a nonimidazole reference compound that has considerable
affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  is the widely used antipsychotic drug
clozapine (2) (figure 2).1 the binding of 2 to other gpcrs has

been extensively studied, and many receptors tolerate its tricyclic
dibenzodiazepine structure to some extent.18,19 because 2 acts
as an antagonist on most gpcrs we were intrigued to find that
it acts as a full agonist at the human  xxxg1081xxx  (r ) 1, pec50 ) 6.7;
pki ) 6.8).16 taking into account the novelty of the target and
the size and rigidity of tricyclic ligand 2, we consider this
compound to be an interesting starting point to explore the  xxxg1081xxx 
binding site. therefore, a series of dibenzodiazepine analogues
were synthesized to explore the structure-activity relationship
(sar) of this class of compounds at the human  xxxg1081xxx .
chemistry. we synthesized several different clozapine
analogues using a modified method described by nagarajan et
al. (1974) (scheme 1).20 first, substituted chloro or fluorobenzoic acids were converted to their corresponding acid chlorides
by socl2. these acid chlorides were then added to a solution
of different substituted o-aminophenols and triethylamine in
thf to obtain the respective amide intermediates. ring closure
of the amides was achieved with naoh in dmf. pocl3 was
used to convert the benzoxazepines in situ to iminochlorides
that could then react with different cyclic amines. compound
14 was synthesized according to a literature procedure.21 most
of the compounds obtained were then converted to fumaric acid
salts to improve handling of the compounds.
pharmacology. radioligand displacement studies. homogenates of sk-n-mc cells stably expressing human h3rs
or h4rs were used to determine ligand affinities for the  xxxg1080xxx  or
 xxxg1081xxx . these methods have been described previously.16 an

analysis of ligand binding to the  xxxg1078xxx  and  xxxg1079xxx  was performed
according to a literature procedure.22
colorimetric camp assay. sk-n-mc cells stably expressing the  xxxg1080xxx  or the  xxxg1081xxx  with a cre-beta-galactosidase reporter
gene were employed to determine the functional acivity of either
the  xxxg1080xxx  or the  xxxg1081xxx . this assay has been described previously.16
nfkb-luciferase reporter assay. cos-7 cells transiently
transfected with the  xxxg1078xxx  were used for the determination of
the functional activity at the  xxxg1078xxx  according to literature.22
results and discussion
initially, we optimized the tricyclic carbon framework of
clozapine for  xxxg1081xxx  affinity.
as can be seen in table 1, the replacement of the x1 nitrogen
of clozapine (2) by a sulfur atom or methylamine group
(compare 2, 8, and 9 with 7a) or a carbon atom (compare 10
and 7b), is detrimental to  xxxg1081xxx  affinity. in contrast, the
substitution of the x1 position with oxygen increases  xxxg1081xxx 
affinity 4-fold (7a). liégois and co-workers have recently
reported crystallographic data showing that the nature of the
atom that fuses the phenyl rings determines the dihedral angle
between the planes of both aromatic rings.23 this angle,
therefore, strongly determines the 3d structure of the molecules.
although an electronic or steric effect might also explain the
increased receptor binding, conformational differences of the
minimized structures can also be seen in the clozapine analogue
series (data not shown).
changing the piperazine substituent in 7a from methyl to any
other substituent decreased affinity for the  xxxg1081xxx  in all cases

(table 2). the distal nitrogen in unsubstituted compound 7c is
less basic than its methylated analogue 7a. the same holds true
for ethylated analogue 7d, yet no increase in  xxxg1081xxx  affinity can
be observed compared to 7c. a steric component might,
therefore, also play a role in the binding of these compounds.
a further increase in the size of this methyl substituent decreases
the  xxxg1081xxx  affinity even more. the absence of the distal nitrogen
atom in the piperazine side chain, as can be seen in the
piperidine (14) and morpholine (7f) analogues, even leads to a
dramatic loss of  xxxg1081xxx  affinity.
changing the r1 chlorine from the 8- to the 7-position
(compounds 7a and 7j) gave a slight increase in affinity.
changing this substituent at the 7-position to a methyl group
as in analogue 7k made the affinity drop slightly. the unsubstituted compound 7b also showed a decrease in affinity
compared to that of 7a, indicating the importance of a lipophilic
substituent on the left aromatic ring. an investigation of the
sar of the right aromatic ring showed that a chlorine substituent
at the 2- (compare 7b and 11) and 3-positions (compare 7h
and 7a) was detrimental to affinity, whereas a chlorine substituent at the 4-position was tolerated (7l). fluorine substitution
at the 2-position also decreased  xxxg1081xxx  affinity (compare 7a and
7g). fluorine substitution at the 3- and 4-positions was allowed,
but these compounds were no more potent than, for example,
the unsubstituted 7-chloro analogue 7j. the functional profile
of the compounds in table 3 was also studied to see if they
would retain the full agonistic behavior that was found for
clozapine. interestingly, all of the compounds in table 3 were
full agonists except for 11, which acted as a partial agonist.
chlorine substitution at the 2-position appeared to be detrimental
for  xxxg1081xxx  affinity as well as for the full agonistic profile of the
clozapine analogues.
table 3 contains several tricyclic structures that bind to the
 xxxg1081xxx  with nanomolar affinity, and of these, compound 7j has
been taken as a model compound to study the affinity and
functional behavior at the other histamine receptors.
these data show that 7j has about a 5-fold higher affinity
for the  xxxg1078xxx  than that for the  xxxg1081xxx  and is 330 times more selective
for the  xxxg1081xxx  over the  xxxg1080xxx . these data suggest that a compound
can be designed that is relatively inactive at the  xxxg1079xxx  and the
 xxxg1080xxx , while binding in the lipophilic domains of the  xxxg1078xxx  and
 xxxg1081xxx  active sites. in fact,  xxxd2082xxx  ligands acting as both  xxxg1078xxx 
and  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists or inverse agonists have been suggested
to be a potential new way to treat inflammatory diseases.10
although one group reported known  xxxg1078xxx  ligands (doxepine,
cinnarazine, and promethazine) to be active at the h4r3 we were

unable to reproduce those results to combine them with the sar
found for the clozapine analogues at the  xxxg1081xxx .16
clozapine (2) and its metabolites have been reported to have
affinity for the d1-d4 receptors, several 5-ht subreceptors,
the r1-adrenoreceptor, the  xxxg1078xxx , and the muscarinic receptor
subtypes. compound 2 and one of its metabolites have also been
reported to act as allosteric modulators of gpcrs, although
evidence for this is sometimes contradictory.18,19 therefore, we
investigated whether 2 and 7j bind to the  xxxg1081xxx  as orthosteric or
allosteric ligands by looking at the bmax value of the  xxxg1081xxx  in
the presence of increasing concentrations of 2 and 7j (figure
3).

the bmax value for [3h]histamine did not change significantly
when increasing concentrations of the selected compounds were
used. in contrast, the kd value for [3h]histamine increased upon
increasing concentrations 2 and 7j. these data indicate that 2
and 7j compete for the same binding site as [3h]histamine in
the  xxxg1081xxx . compounds 2 and 7j, therefore, do not act as allosteric
modulators on the recombinant  xxxg1081xxx  system but as orthosteric
ligands.
we could also show that known  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist 1 competitively antagonized the agonistic effect of 7j (figure 4). schild
plot analysis resulted in a pa2 value of 7.8 for 1, which nicely
correlates with the  xxxg1081xxx  affinity of pki 7.8.16
when the structure of 1 is compared to that of 7j, several
similarities can be noticed. most strikingly, both ligands have
a piperazine moiety linked to an aromatic ring system. for both
classes of compounds, it has been shown that the basic nitrogen
of this piperazine is ideally substituted by a methyl group,
whereas other substituents lead to a drop in affinity.24,25
furthermore, halogenation of the aromatic rings lead to similar
subtle differences in affinity. on the basis of these similarities
in structure and sar and because the pharmacological results
suggest that 7j and 1 compete for the same  xxxg1081xxx  binding site,
we were tempted to perform preliminary modeling studies to
investigate the structural similarities of these compounds, even
though 1 is an (neutral)  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist and 7j is a full  xxxg1081xxx 
agonist.16
for these similarity studies, the procedure as described by
labute and williams was used.26 calculations were carried out
using the flexible alignment module of molecular operating
environment (moe), employing the mmff94 force field. the
best scoring fit (both in terms of similarity and objective
function; similarity f ) 104.6195, objective function s )
187.6832, du ) 0.7498 kcal/mol) is shown in figure 5. in this
superposition, the key structural elements are perfectly superposed. the chlorinated aromatic ring of 7j is superimposed on
the phenyl ring of 1 with the chlorine atoms pointing in the
same direction. the carbonyl group in 1 is flexible enough to
give a good overlay of the protonated nitrogens in both
compounds. the methyl substituents also overlap perfectly,
whereas the bulkier piperazine moiety in compound 1 and 7j
occupy approximately the same space. obviously, this qualitative pharmacophore model is unable to explain the mode of
action of the ligands (agonism for 7j, neutral antagonism for
1). with the limited number of structurally diverse classes of

7j (b) dose-dependently increases the kd value without affecting the bmax of [3h]histamine binding, suggesting that 2 and 7j displace [3h]histamine
in a competitive manner.

its orthosteric binding site in the  xxxg1081xxx . given the structural
similarities of 7j and 1, we have conducted preliminary modeling
studies and propose a model that gives a description of the  xxxg1081xxx 
binding site of 7j. the results from these modeling studies are
currently being used to design new chemical entities that will
fit the  xxxg1081xxx  binding site. in the search for new antipsychotic
drugs, many analogues of 2 have been made in the past that
also seem to fit the  xxxg1081xxx  pharmacophore. the fact that many of
these analogues can modulate the  xxxg1081xxx  and cause a possible
clinically relevant but yet unknown response mediated by this
histamine receptor should, therefore, be taken into consideration.

 xxxg1081xxx  ligands reported to date and without taking into account
the receptor protein environment, it will be difficult to address
the functional activity of the ligands. it has already been shown
that for the histamine  xxxg1080xxx  subtype, subtle changes in the
chemical structures of the  xxxg1080xxx  ligands can have a major impact
on functional activity. even within a single class of ligands,
close homologues can vary in  xxxg1080xxx  activity from agonist to
neutral antagonist and  xxxd1422xxx .27 nevertheless, we
consider this preliminary pharmacophore a useful working
model for  xxxg1081xxx  affinity.
in conclusion, probing the  xxxg1081xxx  pharmacophore, we have
optimized the dibenzodiazepine structure of clozapine (2),
resulting in the identification of 7j as a high-affinity full  xxxg1081xxx 
agonist. compound 7j was found to displace [3h]histamine from
