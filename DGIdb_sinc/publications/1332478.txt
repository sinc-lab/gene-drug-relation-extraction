objectives: the purpose of this study was to determine whether continuous infusion of  xxxd3130xxx  could
prevent preterm delivery in sheep.
study design: sheep in preterm labor induced by  xxxd2643xxx  (mifepristone) received infusions of either
 xxxd3130xxx  (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 5), and the progress of labor was monitored. 132-adrenergic
receptor density and function (agonist-induced  xxxd1773xxx  production) was
measured in myometrial samples from both groups.
results:  xxxd3130xxx  initially inhibited labor contractions. this inhibition was only maintained for 16 hours,
after which both the amplitude and frequency of electromyographic bursts and contractions returned. the
failure of the myometrium to respond to  xxxd3130xxx  (desensitization) was associated with significant
reductions in agonist-induced  xxxd1773xxx  production and 132-adrenergic receptor
concentration in myometrial tissue collected from these animals compared with the saline solution-treated
controls.
conclusions: continuous infusion of  xxxd3130xxx  to sheep in preterm labor produces only a transient
inhibition of contractions. this desensitization is caused by a down-regulation of myometrial 132-adrenergic
receptors. (am j osstet gynecol 1992;167:1399-408.)

although the most widespread treatment for preterm labor is the continuous infusion of a selective 132adrenergic agonist, the efficacy ofthis therapy has been
questioned.' clearly these agents are potent inhibitors
of myometrial contractile activit y2. 3; however, their clinical use for the prevention of preterm delivery requires
that they maintain their effectiveness for long periods
to significantly improve neonatal outcome. surprisingly, in vivo studies analyzing the continuous changes
in myometrial contractile activity during 132-adrenergic
agonist administration over long periods have not been
conducted. studies with short-duration (several hours)
infusions of !32-adrenergic agonists have clearly shown
an inhibitory effect on uterine contractions in both
pregnant" and nonpregnant 4 women. similar findings
have been made in a number of animal species, in-

cluding the sheep" and rat. 6 we and others have also
demonstrated the acute inhibition of myometrial contractions by 132-adrenergic agonists in vitro in humans 3
and animals.' however, if exposure to the agonist is
prolonged, we have observed in the human 3 and sheep'
that contractions return even though the drug remains
active; the myometrium has become desensitized to the
132-adrenergic agonist. we have obtained similar results
in vivo during experiments in nonpregnant sheep.s in
these studies a continuous infusion of the 132-adrenergic
agonist  xxxd2401xxx  was only able to maintain myometrial inhibition for about 45 minutes, after which
both the frequency and amplitude of uterine contractions returned to preinfusion levels. there are no reports examining the ability of !32-adrenergic agonists to
inhibit contractions during preterm labor in animal
models.
132-adrenergic agonists function by increasing intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx 
(camp), which in turn is believed to inhibit the activity
of regulatory contractile proteins (e.g., myosin lightchain kinase). we and others" 9 have shown that during
in vitro desensitization the ability of the myometrium
to generate camp in response to 132-adrenergic agonists
is suppressed.
in addition to concerns as to the efficacy of these
drugs, a number of side effects associated with agonist
therapy have been reported. changes in the endocrine
environment have also been observed during infusion
of 132-adrenergic agonists. in nonpregnant'o and

1400 lye et al.

pregnant" (not in labor) sheep plasma concentrations
of stimulatory prostaglandins were elevated during infusion of  xxxd2401xxx . although prostaglandins have
potent effects on the contractile activity of both vascular
and myometrial smooth muscle, the consequences of
their elevation during 132-adrenergic agonist infusion is
not known. there is little information concerning the
effects of long-term 132-adrenergic agonist administration on the fetus.
in view of the controversy surrounding the use of
132-adrenergic agonists, we conducted our study to determine the effects of prolonged infusions on both uterine contractile activity and on maternal and fetal cardiovascular parameters. specifically, we asked these
questions: (1) will the clinically used 132-adrenergic agonist  xxxd3130xxx  produce long-term inhibition of uterine
contractile activity in sheep in preterm labor? (2) if not,
what are the biochemical mechanisms associated with
this desensitization? (3) what is the effect of prolonged
132-adrenergic agonist administration on maternal and
fetal heart rate and fetal breathing movements? (4) is
132-adrenergic agonist administration associated with
changes in maternal or fetal plasma concentrations of
prostaglandins?

animals. surgery was conducted on 10 sheep of
mixed breeds at 113 to 118 days of gestation. with the
sheep under general anesthesia vascular catheters
(model vll, bolab, lake havasu city, ariz.) were
placed into the fetal carotid artery and jugular vein and
into the fetal trachea (to record fetal breathing movements). vascular catheters (model v4, bolab) were also
inserted into the maternal femoral artery and vein.
uterine contractile activity (intrauterine pressure) was
monitored continuously by means of amniotic catheters
(bolab); multifilament stainless steel electrodes (cooner
wire corp., chatsworth, calif.) sewn into the myometrium were used to monitor electromyographic activity. analgesics and prophylactic antibiotics were administered after surgery, and the animals were allowed
~7 days to recover before experiments were begun.
protocol. preterm labor was induced in all 10 sheep
by the administration of the  xxxg1737xxx  antagonist  xxxd2643xxx  (mifepristone) 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (roussel vclaf). at this dosage we were able to
induce labor (defined as contractions of frequency >25
per 2 hours, duration of < 1 minute, and amplitude of
>5 mm hg) in 44.2 ± 4.2 hours. the pattern of intrauterine pressure and electromyographic activity in
animals in which labor was induced with rv 486 was
identical to that seen in spontaneous term or corticotropin-induced preterm labor in sheep. once preterm
labor was established, the sheep were divided at random into two groups to receive either (1) saline (control)

1 mllhour or (2)  xxxd3130xxx  3 j-lg/kg/min (i.e., approximately 10 mg / hr to the pregnant ewe) via the maternal
femoral vein catheter. the infusions were continued
until high-amplitude uterine contractions with signs of
maternal discomfort (curling of the lip or superimposed abdominal straining movements) were observed.
these symptoms are normal features of advanced labor
in sheep and are usually an indication that delivery is
imminent. to confirm that the return of labor contractions in  xxxd3130xxx -treated animals was the result of
myometrial desensitization the infusion rate of the agonist was doubled at 20- to 30-minute intervals up to
80 mg/hr and the effects on electromyographic and
intrauterine pressure activity monitored. animals were
then killed (overdose of pentobarbital sodium). delivery was not used as an end point in this study for two
reasons: (1) although  xxxd2643xxx  reliably induces the highactivity pattern of uterine activity indicative of labor,
the cervices of these animals undergo variable degrees
of softening and dilatation, with some animals showing
only a small change (thus impeding delivery of the
lamb); (2) we wished to collect myometrial tissue for
biochemical analysis of the functional integrity of the
132-adrenergic receptor system.
blood samples (10 ml) were withdrawn from the maternal femoral artery and femoral vein catheters at 30minute intervals from 60 minutes before to 180 minutes
after commencement of either  xxxd3130xxx  or saline infusions. samples were also withdrawn at 60 minute intervals from the fetal carotid artery. the samples were
collected into ice-cold, heparinized tubes and centrifuged (1500g for 10 minutes at 4° c); the plasma was
removed and stored at - 20° c until assayed for 13,14dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin f20 (pgfm), progesterone, and estradiol-1713 (maternal samples) or  xxxd1903xxx  (pge 2) (fetal samples). samples were also
collected for determination of maternal and fetal blood
gases (blood gas analyzer, abl3, corning, medfield,
mass.).
polygraph monitoring. intrauterine pressure, maternal and fetal blood pressure, and fetal breathing
movements (tracheal pressure) were monitored by connection of the appropriate catheters to pressure transducers (model p23, statham, spectramed, oxnard,
calif.) and the signals passed through a preamplifier
(model 7pl, grass instruments, quincy, mass.). measurements of maternal and fetal heart rate were obtained by processing the preamplifier output through a
tachograph (grass). the myometrial electromyographic signal was processed through a wide-band ac
preamplifier (model 7p5, grass) with the use of a onehalf amplitude, low-frequency filter of 0.3 hz and a onehalf amplitude, high-frequency filter of 10khz. all signals were recorded on a polygraph (model 78, grass).

amplitude of electromyographic bursts and intrauterine pressure cycles (contractions) were calculated in
each 2-hour period from 10 hours before the administration of saline solution- xxxd3130xxx  until the completion of the experiment. values for fetal and maternal
blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at 5-minute intervals and the mean calculated over five 4-hour
periods: (1) before administration of  xxxd2643xxx ; (2) 4hour period before saline solution- xxxd3130xxx ; (3) 4hour period after start of saline solution- xxxd3130xxx ; (4)
4-hour period from + 8 to + 12 after start of saline
solution- xxxd3130xxx ; and (5) 4-hour period before the
end of the experiment, when abdominal straining
movements were present. fetal breathing movements
were defined as negative deflections in tracheal pressure of at least 2 mm hg occurring in bursts of ::::30second durations. the mean percent time spent breathing was calculated for each of the five time periods.
myometrial camp generation. the integrity of 132adrenergic receptor function in the myometrium of
saline- and  xxxd3130xxx -infused animals was examined in
vitro at the conclusion of the experiment. samples of
myometrial tissue were collected at autopsy into
krebs' ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 4.6
mmol/l  xxxd2988xxx , 1.16 mmol/l magnesium
sulfate heptahydrate, 1.16 mmol/l sodium phosphate
monobasic, 2.5 mmol/l calcium chloride dihydrate,
115.5 mmol/l  xxxd3213xxx , 21.9 mmol/l sodium
bicarbonate, and ill mmol/l dextrose, ph 7.4. m yometrial strips (2 x 2 x 15 mm) were cut from the sample, and approximately 100 mg tissue was incubated in
5 ml of krebs' at 37° c for 30 minutes to equilibrate.
the strips were then placed in fresh krebs' (5 ml) containing 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 ilmol/ l  xxxd2401xxx .
after 5 minutes the strips were rapidly frozen on dry
ice and stored at -70° c.
the frozen myometrial strips were subsequently
weighed and minced in 1.5 ml ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5 mmol/l  xxxd2388xxx  (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor). the samples
were homogenized (brinkman polytron, sybron-brinkman canada, rexdale, ontario; setting 10, 10-second
pulse x 4). samples were spun at 1o,000g for 10 minutes at 4° c. the pellet was redissolved in 2 ml of o.in
sodium hydroxide for protein determination with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (type iv, sigma chemical, st.
louis) as a standard. aliquots of supernatant (3 x 100
ill) were dried under air and each brought up in 0.5
ml of 50 mmol/l sodium acetate buffer, ph 6.2.
myometrial p2-adrenergic receptor analysis. preparation of myometrial membrane fraction and subsequent analysis of ligand binding was carried out with
a method similar to that of dattel et al. 12
myometrial membrane preparation. frozen tissue
(collected at autopsy) was pulverized on dry ice and

homogenized (2 x 80-second pulse at 8000 rpm;
ultra-turrex t25 polytron, terochem laboratories,
mississauga, ontario) in 50 mmol/l tris-i mmol/l
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer (ph 8.0). homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 1000g for 15 minutes at 4° c, and the supernatant retained on ice. the
pellet was resuspended in tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic buffer and the homogenization repeated. the
homogenates were combined and centrifuged at
40,000g for 30 minutes at 4° c. the pellet was retained
and resuspended in 50 mmol/l tris-4 mmol/l  xxxd2532xxx  buffer (ph 7.4), and the centrifugation
step was repeated. the resulting pellet was suspended
in i ml tris- xxxd2532xxx  buffer and frozen at
- 70° c for future receptor assay.
p2-adrenergic receptor assay. frozen membrane
preparations were thawed and uniform suspensions obtained by brief homogenization with a teflon wandglass dounce homogenizer. protein content was determined as described above. aliquots of the membrane
preparation (20 to 30 ilg protein) were incubated in
the presence of varying concentrations of the antagonist iodine 125-labeled cyanopindolol (6 to 200
pmol/l, amersham, oakville, ontario) for 60 minutes
at 30° c. incubations were terminated via rapid vacuum
filtration with cold tris- xxxd2532xxx  buffer
through filters (whatman gfic, whatman limited,
maidstone, england). radioactivity retained on the filters was counted (lkb 1282 compugamma universal
'v-counter, fisher scientific, toronto). nonspecific
binding was defined as binding in the presence of 10
ilmol/ l  xxxd2401xxx .
radioimmunoassays. the arterial and venous concentrations of pge z and pgfm in 500 ill aliquots of
plasma were estimated by specific radioimmunoassays
that have been fully characterized and validated for
sheep plasma. 13 in brief, plasma was acidified (to ph
3) with hydrochloric acid and the prostaglandins extracted with  xxxd2052xxx  (8 volumes). the ether extract was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and
the samples were reconstituted with phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with specific antisera
and tritiated prostaglandins (pge z , new england nuclear, lachine, quebec; pgfm, amersham). the interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation for each
prostaglandin were <11 % and <9%, respectively.
estradiol and progesterone were measured by specific radioimmunoassays with antisera that have been
validated for sheep plasma. i •. 15 both assays involved
prior extraction of the plasma. petroleum ether (40
volumes) was used to extract progesterone (from 50 ill
plasma) and  xxxd2052xxx  (5 volumes) used to extract
estradiol (from 1000 ill plasma). after evaporation of
the solvent extract, samples were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with spe-

results
labor was established in all sheep after the administration of  xxxd2643xxx  (mean 44.2 ± 4.2 hours). at the
time of assignment of sheep to either the saline solution
or  xxxd3130xxx  groups uterine contraction frequency was
approximately 30 per 2 hours and amplitude was 15
mm hg. commencement of  xxxd3130xxx  infusion to five

sheep resulted in an immediate and near-total inhibition of both the electrical and mechanical activity of the
uterus;  xxxd3130xxx  infusion was also associated with an
abrupt rise in maternal heart rate. over the first 2 hours
of  xxxd3130xxx  treatment the frequency (from 41.8 ± 2.9
to 18.4 ± 1.34; fig. 1) and amplitude (from 17.7 ± 1.4
to 10.0 ± 0.7; fig. 2) of intrauterine pressure cycles
(contractions) was significantly reduced. similar
changes were seen in electromyographic activity with
the frequency (from 34.2 ± 2.7 to 17.4 ± 3.1 bursts
per 2 hours) and amplitude (from 1.28 ± 0.11 mv to
0.69 ± 0.06 m v) both being significantly reduced. the
duration of electromyographic bursts, significantly reduced with the onset of labor (from 6.83 ± 0.37 minutes before  xxxd2643xxx  administration to 0.96 ± 0.08 minutes 44 hours after  xxxd2643xxx ), did not change throughout
the saline and  xxxd3130xxx  infusions. in spite of this initial
inhibition, uterine quiescence could not be maintained.
electromyographic burst frequency and amplitude remained significantly reduced for only 12 and 14 hours,
respectively, before increasing to values found before
the commencement of the  xxxd3130xxx  infusion. intrauterine pressure changes followed a similar course, although contraction frequency and amplitude was still
significantly below preinfusion levels at + 16 and + 18
hours, respectively; this resulted in a period when there
was a degree of dissociation between electro myographic
activity, which had fully returned, and amplitude of
uterine contractions, which remained inhibited.
control animals infused with saline solution exhibited a steady increase in uterine contractile activity,
reaching a plateau of - 50 contractions per 2 hours and

an amplitude of -18 mm hg. within 24 hours of the
start of the infusions there was no significant difference
between the parameters of uterine activity between the
control and experimental groups (figs. 1 and 2).
at the time of apparent desensitization, increasing
the infusion of  xxxd3130xxx  to very high levels had no
effect on either the frequency or amplitude of uterine
contractions (fig. 3), although there was a small but
significant (p < 0.05) increase in maternal heart rate
(+ 8.8 beats/min at 20 mg/hr and + 9.1 beats/min at
40 mg/hr).
the mean duration from the onset of saline or  xxxd3130xxx  infusion to the occurrence of abdominal straining
movements was 16.9 ± 5.8 hours and 24.4 ± 3.4
hours, respectively (p > 0.05). the mean duration
from the administration of  xxxd2643xxx  until termination
of the experiment was also not significantly different
between the two groups (66.3 ± 6.5 in saline solutiontreated and 60.5 ± 7.5 hours in  xxxd3130xxx -treated
animals).
myometrial  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated camp production and the density of 132-adrenergic receptors (fig. 4)
were both significantly reduced in samples collected
from animals that had received  xxxd3130xxx  infusions compared with the saline solution controls. in spite of the
reduction in f32-adrenergic receptor density, the binding
affinity (dissociation constant) was not significantly altered by the exposure to  xxxd3130xxx  ( xxxd3130xxx  38.5 ± 6.6
pmolll vs saline solution 56.5 ± 10.7 pmoill).
adminstration of  xxxd3130xxx  was associated with a significant (p < 0.05) increase in maternal heart rate over
the first 4 hours of the infusion (from 118.4 ± 5.4 to

161.2 ± 5.3 beats/min; fig. 5). maternal heart rate
subsequently fell to intermediate values (134.6 ± 3.3
beats/min) by 8 to 12 hours and remained at this level
throughout the remainder of  xxxd3130xxx  treatment. although this level was approximately 17 beats/min
above the preritodrine infusion rate, it was not significantly different from this baseline (preinfusion) value
or from the rate during the first 4 hours of  xxxd3130xxx 
treatment. there was no significant change in maternal
heart rate during saline infusion. administration of
either saline solution or  xxxd3130xxx  had no significant
effect on fetal heart rate.
fetal breathing movements (calculated as percent
time spent breathing) were significantly inhibited with
the onset of  xxxd2643xxx -induced labor, which was associated with a significant increase in fetal plasma pge 2 concentrations. in spite of the initial inhibition oflabor contractions after commencement of  xxxd3130xxx  administration, fetal breathing movements remained suppressed
throughout the remainder of the study (fig. 6).
the blood samples collected at 30-minute intervals
during the infusions revealed a significant increase in
maternal arterial (+ 63.6 ± 12.6%, fig. 7) and venous
(+ 44.5 ± 6.2%) plasma concentrations ofpgfm in animals treated with  xxxd3130xxx , with no significant changes
in saline solution-treated animals. this increase was
superimposed on pgfm levels already increased as a
result of the onset of labor. no significant changes were
observed in maternal plasma estradiol (which ranged
between 8.8 and 12.8 pg/ml for saline solution and 9.9
and 12.7 pg/ml for  xxxd3130xxx ), progesterone (range between 11.5 and 16.7 ng/ml for saline solution and 11.5

comment

these data demonstrate that the prolonged, continuous infusion of the 132-adrenergic agonist  xxxd3130xxx  to
sheep in preterm labor, although initially producing an
inhibition of uterine contractile activity, was unable to
maintain this inhibition and failed to significantly prolong the length of gestation. furthermore, this failure
was associated with a desensitization of myometrial mechanical, electrical, and biochemical responsiveness to
132-adrenergic agonists. the data support our previous
studies of the effects of these agonists on myometrial
contractile activity in vivo in the nonpregnant sheep"
and in vitro in the sheep,7 human,' and, in the study
of caritis et ai., 17 in pregnant sheep not in labor. myometrial desensitization to 132-adrenergic agonists has
also been demonstrated in vitro in human tissue after
treatment with these drugs for the prevention of preterm labor. 9 . 18 a particular strength of our study has
been our ability to correlate treatment outcome with
both in vivo contractile activity measurements and also
biochemical parameters defining the myometrial responsiveness to 132-adrenergic agonists.
13.-adrenergic agonists interact with specific recep-

tors on the myometrial cell membrane to activate, via
a  xxxd2247xxx -binding protein, adenylate
cyclase, and thereby increase intracellular camp levels.
camp activation of camp-dependent protein kinase is
believed to reduce the activity of the key regulatory
enzyme myosin light-chain kinase or reduce the availability of intracellular calcium. however, the extent to
which these mechanisms operate in vivo in the myometrium, and hence the role of these components in
the desensitization process, is not known. the data
from the present study have demonstrated that the
failure of contractile inhibition is associated with a decrease in 132-adrenergic agonist-induced camp production by the myometrium, suggesting a failure in
components of the 132-adrenergic receptor system
that act before camp. our finding of a significant decrease in the concentration of myometrial 132-adrenergic receptors in sheep receiving  xxxd3130xxx  strongly
suggests that receptor down-regulation may be at least
one of the mechanisms involved in this desensitization.
to prove that the myometrium (of animals receiving
 xxxd3130xxx ) was indeed desensitized we tested whether
increased infusion rates of the drug could inhibit activity before tissue collection. it is possible that the receptor down-regulation was the result of these acute
higher infusion rates rather than the continuous infusion of  xxxd3130xxx  and hence was not causally related

to the desensitization phenomenon. we believe this to
be unlikely because (l) caritis et al., i7 using similar dosages of  xxxd3130xxx  (1 to 4 il-g/kg/min) as a steady-state
infusion in dre2"nant sheed (not in labor), also found a

50% decrease in 132-adrenergic receptor number that
was associated with a failure of the agonist to maintain
myometrial inhibition when challenged with an oxytocin bolus and (2) in in vitro studies 7 we have found

volume 167
number 5

that the reduction in 132-adrenergic receptor number
and camp production is temporally closely associated
with the return of contractions. a similar reduction in
agonist-induced camp production and 132-adrenergic
receptor concentration has also been reported in human myometrial samples obtained from patients who
had received 132-adrenergic agonist treatment to prevent preterm labor. '8 although we cannot rule out
additional causes of desensitization (e.g., increased
phosphodiesterase activity) in our present experimental paradigm, we have shown in vitro in the sheep that
adenylate cyclase itself and the post-camp mechanisms
involved in inhibition of myometrial contractions remain functional during desensitization. 7
data from several cell lines suggest that exposure to
132-adrenergic agonists leads to an internalization of the
receptor into cytoplasmic vesicles; removal of the agonist allows a recycling of the receptor back to the cell
membrane. under conditions where agonist exposure
is prolonged (continuous infusion) it might be predicted that there would be an increased probability of
fusion of the vesicles with lysosomes and hence the
degradation of the receptors (down-regulation). sladeczek et al. ,9 have reported that replenishment of receptors in c 6 glioma cells is very slow. this is consistent
with our failure to recover full myometrial responsiveness in vitr0 7 and the protracted recovery of mononuclear leukocyte 132-adrenergic receptor function (5
to 8 days) after administration of 132-adrenergic agonists
to women in preterm labor. this has important clinical
implications because if myometrial receptors were lost
during agonist treatment, there might not be sufficient
time to replenish them; consequently, tocolysis would
be ineffective. any method to improve the effectiveness
of 132-adrenergic agonists must clearly aim to prevent
this loss of receptor.
our data raise questions with regard to the concept
of "spare" 132-adrenergic receptors in the myometrium.
krall et al. 20 demonstrated in the rat that 10% receptor
occupancy was sufficient to induce 50% maximal inhibition and that 50% occupancy imparted full relaxation. however, in the present study a 50% reduction
in total 132-adrenergic receptor concentration was associated with a complete failure of agonist-induced inhibition and a 25% reduction in agonist-induced camp
accumulation. the inability of the remaining 50% of
receptors to transmit the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3130xxx 
suggests either that spare receptors do not exist for the
myometrial 132-adrenergic receptor system or that
these binding sites do not represent functionally coupled receptors. indeed, the suggestion of levin et ap'
that those receptors resistant to down-regulation are
not coupled to adenylate cyclase and hence are incapable of eliciting a biologic response is consistent with
our own data.
the data from our study are consistent with the results of manv clinical trials of the effectiveness of 139-

adrenergic agonists in preventing preterm birth. in
general, these studies have reported a significant but
small prolongation of pregnancy but with no significant
improvement in neonatal outcome. we observed a
small increase in the length of labor in  xxxd3130xxx - versus
saline-infused sheep, although this was not significant
(probably because of the low sample size). in 5 of 7
saline-infused sheep the length of labor was <20 hours
as opposed to only 2 of 5 animals in the  xxxd3130xxx  group.
in addition, although the amplitude of contractions in
the  xxxd3130xxx -infused sheep had returned to pretreatment levels, it was still significantly lower than that of
the control animals at the termination of the experiment. nevertheless, the return of labor and, perhaps
most strikingly, the inability to induce any inhibition of
contractions with dosages of the agonist of up to 80 mg
per hour, clearly demonstrates the profound loss of
integrity of the 132-adrenergic receptor system.
the time course for  xxxd3130xxx -induced desensitization in our pregnant sheep was considerably longer (16
hours) than that found in nonpregnant sheep (45 to
60 minutes).8 mononuclear leukocytes from nonpregnant women receiving in vivo 132-adrenergic agonist administration also exhibit a more rapid desensitization
than cells from pregnant women, suggesting that a similar phenomenon may occur in the human. although
we do not know the mechanisms responsible for this
effect, we believe it is an important area for future study
if 132-adrenergic agonist tocolysis is to be made more
effective.
the increase in plasma prostaglandin concentrations
in sheep receiving  xxxd3130xxx  supports our previous observations in nonpregnant sheep'o and in pregnant
sheep not in labor" during infusion of 132-adrenergic
agonists. in the pregnant sheep the increase was predominantly in the metabolite ofpgf 2a , whereas in nonpregnant sheep the major increase was in the e-series
prostaglandins. in addition, in vitro incubation of intrauterine tissues 22 with 132-adrenergic agonists also results in significant increase in prostaglandin production. the clinical significance of increased stimulatory
prostaglandin production during infusion of a 132-adrenergic agonist remains to be determined, though
clearly if desensitization were to occur the prostaglandins could act to augment contractile activity. in addition, prostaglandins have been shown to reduce the
effectiveness of 132-adrenergic agonist-induced camp
production in the rat myometrium (heterologous desensitization), probably by reducing  xxxd2247xxx  binding protein coupling or adenylate cyclase activity. although we were not able to detect evidence of a reduction in postreceptor functioning of
the myometrial132-adrenergic receptor system in vitro,
we cannot exclude some contribution to the overall failure of 132-adrenergic agonist action by prostaglandininduced heterologous desensitization in our study or
indeed during tocolysis with these drugs in the human.

1408 lye et al.

on commencement of the  xxxd3130xxx  infusion, the
stimulation of the myometrial 132-adrenergic receptor
system was also accompanied by stimulation of the
cardiac 13,-receptors, resulting in a pronounced maternal tachycardia. this increase in heart rate has been
reported in a number of previous studies.' however,
our study also demonstrated that this elevation in maternal heart rate was maintained, albeit at a reduced
level throughout the infusion. furthermore, once
spontaneous contractions had returned, the augmentation of the rate of infuson of  xxxd3130xxx  resulted in an
additional small but significant increase in heart rate
but no inhibition of contractile activity. these data suggest that the adrenergic receptor systems responsible
for inhibition of myometrial activity and stimulation of
heart rate do not demonstrate the same degree of desensitization. we found a similar response in nonpregnant women receiving an infusion of  xxxd3130xxx . in that
study desensitization of mononuclear leukocyte responsiveness to 132-adrenergic agonists had occurred after 3 hours, although a significant tachycardia (a side
effect of  xxxd3130xxx ) remained throughout the 6 hours
of the infusion.
in contrast to the changes in the mother, the fetal
heart rate showed only small changes throughout the
infusion period. this may reflect a reduction in placental passage of the drug in sheep because administation of  xxxd3130xxx  directly to the fetus does result in a
tachycardia (unpublished data). it was of interest that
although there was a significant inhibition of fetal
breathing movements with the onset of labor as expected, no return in the incidence of breathing occurred during the period when contractile activity was
inhibited. this lack of return was not the result of any
deterioration in fetal condition because blood gases remained satisfactory throughout the experimental period; it likely reflects the maintenance of elevated
plasma pge levels. if these data can be extrapolated to
the human they suggest that the use of fetal breathing
movements as an indicator of fetal health may not be
appropriate during tocolysis, at least with 132-adrenergic
agonists.
in this report we have shown that inhibition of uterine contractions during preterm labor in the sheep cannot be maintained by continuous infusion of the 132adrenergic agonist  xxxd3130xxx . this failure is the result
of a desensitization of the myometrium and is associated with a significant reduction in myometrial agonistinduced camp production and 132-adrenergic receptor
concentration.
