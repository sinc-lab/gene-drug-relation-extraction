selective costimulation modulators: a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  t cells have a central role in the orchestration of the immune pathways that contribute to the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). the requirement for a dual signal for t-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to ra therapy. this approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. the fusion protein  xxxd52xxx  is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the cd28 receptor on the t cell.  xxxd52xxx  dose-dependently reduces t-cell proliferation, serum concentrations of acute-phase reactants, and other markers of inflammation, including the production of rheumatoid factor by b cells. recent studies have provided consistent evidence that treatment with  xxxd52xxx  results in a rapid onset of efficacy that is maintained over the course of treatment in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapies. this efficacy includes patient-centered outcomes and radiographic measurement of disease progression.  xxxd52xxx  has also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile to date. this article reviews the rationale for this therapeutic approach and highlights some of the recent studies that demonstrate the benefits obtained by using  xxxd52xxx . this clinical experience indicates that  xxxd52xxx  is a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of patients with ra.
