rofecoxib in patients with activated
osteoarthritis (color study)

abstract

background and objective: impaired mobility and pain mean a loss of quality of
life for patients with rheumatic diseases. therefore the initial aim of therapy is
rapid and efficient analgesia in order to achieve the best possible result for these
patients.  xxxd2508xxx  is a strong analgesic and anti-inflammatory nsaid with
balanced cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-1/cox-2 inhibition and excellent tolerability.
in the course of the development of selective cox-2 inhibitors, it was maintained
that cox-2 inhibitors decrease the risk of injury to the upper gastrointestinal (gi)
tract with a similar efficacy to that of classic nsaids. however, a clinical trial
comparing both substances has never been performed. in the present study we
investigated the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis with  xxxd2508xxx  in
comparison with treatment with the selective cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib. this
multicentre clinical investigation focused on efficacy and tolerability.
patients and methods: a total of 2520 patients (most of them with osteoarthritis)
were treated over 25 days on average. before and after treatment patients
documented their individual scores for pain on movement, at rest and during the
night, and their individual duration of morning stiffness as well as the consequent
grade of restriction. at the end of the study all individuals involved judged the
efficacy and safety of the therapy.
results: all improvements in each efficacy parameter were clinically relevant in
each treatment group and significantly superior (p < 0.001) in the  xxxd2508xxx 
group. pain on movement (–45.3%), at rest (–42.0%) and at night (–42.5%) was
reduced by rofecoxib, whereas improvements after treatment with  xxxd2508xxx 
exceeded those effects significantly (–55.8%, –55.8% and –59.9%, respectively).
shortening of the duration of morning stiffness was significantly (p < 0.001) more
pronounced with  xxxd2508xxx  (–66.6%) than with rofecoxib (–50.2%). nearly
three times as many patients discontinued rofecoxib treatment because of lack of
efficacy compared with  xxxd2508xxx  treatment (8.9% versus 3.4%). physicians
judged  xxxd2508xxx  to be markedly superior to rofecoxib, since excellent efficacy
was observed in 40.9% of all cases versus 20.1% with rofecoxib. serious adverse
events did not occur. adverse events were reported in 5.4% of all  xxxd2508xxx 
patients compared with 12.0% of the rofecoxib recipients (p < 0.001). gi symptoms showed a slight trend of being less frequent following rofecoxib therapy.
conclusions: the results of this study confirmed the efficacy and safety of both
drugs.  xxxd2508xxx  and rofecoxib are effective in the treatment of patients with

228

activated osteoarthritis; the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd2508xxx 
are significantly superior to those of rofecoxib without inferiority in tolerability.

apart from restricted mobility, pain presents an
extreme condition for patients with inflammatory
diseases of the musculoskeletal system and is often
the most important reason for a severely reduced
quality of life. therefore, the primary target of therapy is a rapid and highly effective analgesic and
anti-inflammatory treatment in order to restore an
adequate quality of life.
 xxxd2508xxx  (telos®, merckle gmbh, ulm, germany)1 is a modern non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (nsaid) belonging to the  xxxd3311xxx  group of
drugs and having pronounced analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.  xxxd2508xxx  differs from
other  xxxd3311xxx  compounds in its potent inhibition of
prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that explains
the particularly pronounced efficacy of the substance. in vitro,  xxxd2508xxx  inhibited prostaglandin
d2 ( xxxg1073xxx ) formation in rat polymorphonuclear
leucocytes, displaying a 100-fold greater potency
than  xxxd3311xxx  (concentration giving 50% inhibition [ic50] = 0.02 versus 2.45 mumol/l).[1] in vivo,
 xxxd2508xxx  was more potent than  xxxd2969xxx  in
preventing  xxxd208xxx -induced lethality in mice.[2] it has been suggested that nsaids with a long
elimination half-life (≥10h) are accompanied by a
higher incidence of severe adverse events when
compared with drugs with elimination half-lives
≤4h.[3] in the case of  xxxd2508xxx , the introduction of
a chlorine substituent allowed a reduction in the
plasma elimination half-life (t1/2), which is typically
very long for oxicams (e.g.  xxxd2969xxx  t1/2 = 50h), to
approximately 4h. this short half-life, in turn,
promises a comparatively good tolerability.
in the early 1990s two isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase (cox-1 and cox-2) were revealed. the inhibiting effect of  xxxd2508xxx  on both isoforms was
investigated, for example, in a whole blood assay.
results of this investigation showed that  xxxd2508xxx 
inhibits both isoforms in the same concentration
1

range (ic50/cox-1/ic50/cox-2 = 1), i.e. a balanced
inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 is achieved.[4,5]
the prospect of having an anti-inflammatory
therapy without typical nsaid adverse events, in
particular gastrointestinal (gi) tract effects, but with
satisfactory efficacy by use of specific cox-2 inhibitors led to the development of these drugs. the
first specific cox-2 inhibitor to be introduced on
the german market was rofecoxib (vioxx®, merck
sharp & dohme gmbh, haar, germany).
new findings regarding the role of the cox
isoforms in physiological processes and in inflammation reactions have given rise to doubts about this
cox-2 inhibition.[6] the postulated superiority of
cox-2 inhibitors with regard to gi adverse events
on the one hand and their efficacy when compared
with that of traditional nsaids on the other hand
have been questioned.[7] according to these new
findings, inhibition of both cox isoforms, as
achieved by  xxxd2508xxx , seems to result in superior
efficacy without associated disadvantages in tolerability.
comparative investigations are not yet available
for  xxxd2508xxx  and rofecoxib. the objective of the
present noninterventional trial (nivt) was to investigate if there are clinically relevant differences between the two compounds with respect to efficacy
and/or tolerability when they are administered under
routine conditions in clinical practice. in addition,
changes in the symptom scores of morning stiffness
and/or pain were assessed.
the present study was performed in accordance
with the criteria set forth for the registration of drugs
by the bundesinstitut für arzneimittel und medizinprodukte (federal institute for drugs and medicinal
products) on 12 november 1998 and published in
the bundesanzeiger (official bulletin) no. 229 dated
4 december 1998.

patients and methods

study participants

the target group for this trial consisted of patients under ambulatory therapy. no stipulations
were made regarding assignment, so physicians
were able to include both their own and assigned
patients. because of the registered areas for indications for both preparations, physicians specialising
in general medicine, internal medicine, rheumatology and orthopaedics were defined as being particularly suitable for participation. further stipulations
were not made. the study is representative since
physicians and patients from the entire federal republic of germany participated. the recruitment
period was between 1 july 2000 and 19 february
2001. the data obtained from the included 2520
patients were then evaluated, and the demographic
data are presented in table i.
indications

at the time the study was performed, rofecoxib,
in contrast to  xxxd2508xxx , was only registered for the
treatment of symptoms (e.g. pain and inflammation)
occurring with irritative conditions of degenerative
joint diseases, therefore patients with activated osteoarthritis were chosen as the study population.

treatment

the study protocol of this nivt contained all the
relevant criteria to allow the physicians the
characterisation of the patients, their clinical picture
and treatment requirements. stipulations other than
those given in the expert information regarding
treatment, patient groups, dosage, contraindications,
etc. were not made. the recommended daily dosage
for  xxxd2508xxx  was 8mg twice daily. the maximum
daily dose of rofecoxib was 25mg. duration and
dosage during the nivt were individually determined by the participating physicians (figure 1). the
daily dosage depended on the intensity of the disease following the dose recommendations in the
package leaflet.

after the end of therapy as determined by the
physician, as with the entry examination, pain quality, duration of morning stiffness and the resulting
restriction were documented by the physician. additional physician and patient ratings at the end of
therapy referred to efficacy and tolerability of the
preparations under investigation. rating was performed on a scale of 1–5 (excellent–very bad). concomitant medication was described, if applicable,
and information on adverse events was continuously
collected and documented (adverse events were assessed by spontaneous reports by the patients and by
nonsuggestive questioning). the number of treatment discontinuations and the reasons for discontinuation were also recorded.
statistical analysis

in accordance with the objectives, the data underwent a descriptive statistical evaluation comprising
minimum and maximum values, mean values,
standard deviations (sd) and standard errors (se).
parameters were: pain on movement, pain at rest,
pain at night before and after treatment, duration of
morning stiffness and the subsequent extent of restriction.
the wilcoxon-mann-whitney-test was used for
calculation for comparability of demographic data
(age, body mass index [bmi], broca-index, height
and weight) at baseline. the kruskal-wallis-test
was used for calculation of differences (duration of
treatment; pain at rest, on movement and at night;
duration of morning stiffness) between treatment
groups. the sas-module glm was used for analysis of covariance (ancova) of pain at rest, on
movement and at night, duration of morning stiffness, duration of diagnosis before treatment, treatment, sex, age, height and weight; the ci was limited to 95% (alpha = 0.05). pearson’s chi2 test was used to
compare adverse events.
results
patients

activated arthritis was diagnosed in 2322 patients (83.3%) of the entire patient population.
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

twenty-eight patients (1.0%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 28 (1.0%) had arthritis of the knee and 16 (0.5%)
had arthritis of the hip. nineteen patients (0.7%) had
a diagnosis of cervical spine syndrome and 32 patients (1.9%) a diagnosis of polyarthritis. further
clinical pictures were very rarely observed.
one thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight patients with a mean age of 59 years (range 11–100
years) were treated with  xxxd2508xxx , and 632 patients with a mean age of 61 years (range 14–97
years) received rofecoxib. sex and bmi did not
show relevant differences within either group. in
65.1% and 69.6% of patients in the  xxxd2508xxx  and
rofecoxib groups, respectively, the underlying disease existed for at least 181 days (table i). before the
beginning of the study, patients were mainly treated
with diclofenac ( xxxd2508xxx  group 44%, rofecoxib
group 43%), ibuprofen ( xxxd2508xxx  group 20%,
rofecoxib group 18%), paracetamol ( xxxd2508xxx 
group 14%, rofecoxib group 16%),  xxxd2969xxx 
( xxxd2508xxx  group 4.6%, rofecoxib group 5.7%),
tramadol ( xxxd2508xxx  group 3.9%, rofecoxib group
4.4%) and indomethacin ( xxxd2508xxx  group 2.1%,
rofecoxib group 2.4%).
dosage and duration of therapy

the average duration of treatment was 24.6 days
in the  xxxd2508xxx -treated group (± 0.55 se). the
recommended daily dose of 16mg was administered
to 56% of the patients; almost 35% received 8mg
daily, 4% of the patients were treated with  xxxd2508xxx   xxxd2531xxx , and the remaining 5% of the patients
followed special dosage instructions of their physicians, as the dosages were partly adjusted to individual needs.
the mean treatment period for the comparative
group patients was 25.5 days (± 0.78 se). the
recommended maximum dose of 25mg was given to
64% of the patients, almost 25% were treated with
12.5mg daily, and 6% of the patients receiving
rofecoxib were administered 50mg daily. the remaining 5% received individual dosages (figure 1).
there were no clinically relevant differences regarding concomitant medication, in particular with
respect to analgesics.

effects on pain
pain at night

before the start of therapy patients assessed the
intensity of their current pain on a visual analogue
scale (vas) ranging from 0–100 (no pain at all –
unbearable pain). the assessment of pain at night
before treatment with  xxxd2508xxx  yielded a value of
43.1 (± 0.55 se) vas units, and the corresponding
value for the comparator group was 42.5 (± 0.93
se). treatment with  xxxd2508xxx  reduced pain at
night to 16.6 (± 0.36 se) units, i.e. by 59.9% (±
0.82), treatment with rofecoxib to 22.6 units (± 0.77
se), i.e. by 42.5% (± 2.67 se) [figure 2]. reduction
of pain at night after  xxxd2508xxx  was statistically
significantly (p < 0.001) superior to rofecoxib.

231

difference between the two groups was statistically
significant (p < 0.001) in favour of  xxxd2508xxx .
pain at rest

the mean value obtained for pain at rest was 49.6
vas units (± 0.53 se) for patients in the  xxxd2508xxx 
group and 49.4 (± 0.87 se) for the rofecoxib group.
patients treated with  xxxd2508xxx  experienced a reduction of 55.8% (± 0.76 se), to 21.4 vas units
(± 0.38 se), compared with rofecoxib patients, who
had a reduction of 42.0% (± 1.45 se), to 27.5 units
(± 0.77 se) [figure 2]. reduction of pain at rest was
significantly (p < 0.001) superior in the  xxxd2508xxx 
group.
effects on morning stiffness
duration

at the beginning of therapy, mean duration of
morning stiffness was 22.3 min (range 0–300 min;
± 0.74 se) in the  xxxd2508xxx  group compared with
23.5 min (range 0–180 min; ± 1.24 se) in the
rofecoxib group. at the end of therapy, the average
duration of morning stiffness was reduced to 7.2 min
(± 0.35 se) [figure 3] in  xxxd2508xxx  recipients and
to 11.8 min (± 0.83 se) in patients treated with
rofecoxib. these changes corresponded to a significantly (p < 0.001) more pronounced reduction of
66.6% (± 1.09 se) by  xxxd2508xxx  compared with
50.2% (± 1.99 se) by rofecoxib.
restriction

restriction due to morning stiffness was severe
in 11.6% and 11.7% of  xxxd2508xxx  and rofecoxib
patients, respectively, before therapy and decreased
 xxxd2508xxx 
rofecoxib

the mean baseline values before the start of
treatment were 68.4 vas units (± 0.45 se) in patients treated with  xxxd2508xxx  and 70.1 (± 0.69 se)
in patients receiving rofecoxib; these values were
statistically comparable. at the end of the treatment
period a reduction of pain on movement for  xxxd2508xxx  patients was measured as 55.8% (± 0.57 se), to
29.9 units (± 0.42 se). for rofecoxib patients a
mean of 37.3 units (± 0.81) was calculated, i.e.

efficacy

the efficacy assessment was carried out by both
physicians and patients (figure 4). therapy with
rofecoxib was rated by 19.8% of patients as being
excellent;  xxxd2508xxx  therapy was rated as being
excellent by 41.1% of patients. rofecoxib therapy
was rated as ‘moderate’ to ‘very bad’ by 31.8% of
patients (moderate 23.6%, bad 6.9%, very bad
1.3%), in contrast to only 12.1% of the lornoxicamtreated patients (moderate 9.8%, bad 2.1%, very bad
0.2%).
participating physicians rated rofecoxib as being
excellent in 20.1% of cases and  xxxd2508xxx  as excellent in 40.9% of patients. a ‘moderate’ to ‘very bad’
judgement was made in 27.9% (moderate 22.3%,
bad 4.9%, very bad 0.6%) and 8.9% (moderate
7.9%, bad 0.9%, very bad 0.1%) of rofecoxib- and
 xxxd2508xxx -treated patients, respectively.
tolerability

tolerability was also rated according to a fivepoint scale (1 = excellent to 5 = very bad). a total of
37.7% of rofecoxib-recipients rated the tolerability
of their treatment as excellent in contrast to 50.1%
of  xxxd2508xxx -recipients. a ‘moderate’ to ‘very

adverse events

adverse events were continuously recorded and
documented during the treatment period; 5.4% of all
patients treated with  xxxd2508xxx  reported adverse
events compared with 12.0% of patients receiving
rofecoxib, a significant difference (p < 0.001). single adverse events were reported in 4.9% of  xxxd2508xxx  and 10.3% of rofecoxib cases. more than one
adverse event was reported in 0.4% of lornoxicamand 1.7% of rofecoxib-treated patients.
severe adverse events were not reported. adverse events that occurred with  xxxd2508xxx  treatment were nsaid-typical symptoms such as diarrhoea (7; rofecoxib 0), nausea (3; rofecoxib 2),
vomiting (3; rofecoxib 0) and gi disturbances
(7 rofecoxib; 1). interestingly, with rofecoxib treatment gi tract adverse events such as gastritis (2;
 xxxd2508xxx  0), haemorrhagic duodenal ulcer (1;
 xxxd2508xxx  0) and mucosa vesicle (2;  xxxd2508xxx  0)
occurred, but were somewhat less frequent with
 xxxd2508xxx . the most frequently reported adverse
event was lack of efficacy (table iii). therapy was
discontinued due to lack of efficacy in 8.9% (n = 56)
of rofecoxib-treated patients and in only 3.4% (n =
64) of patients taking  xxxd2508xxx . the difference

 xxxd2508xxx  vs rofecoxib in activated osteoarthritis

between the two groups was statistically significant
(p < 0.001). discontinuation due to adverse events
occurred in 1.5% and 1.1% of  xxxd2508xxx  and
rofecoxib patients, respectively; the difference was
not statistically significant.
discussion
 xxxd2508xxx , a modern  xxxd3311xxx  with balanced
cox-1/cox-2 inhibition, has been on the german
market for approximately 5 years. numerous controlled clinical studies have shown the excellent
efficacy and tolerability of this agent, and experience from clinical practice has confirmed this.[1,8-12]
a direct comparison between  xxxd2508xxx  and the
first marketed specific cox-2 inhibitor in germany,
rofecoxib, with respect to efficacy and tolerability
has not yet been performed. the results of this noninterventional trial carried out under practice conditions showed that there are clinically relevant differences in all investigational parameters of both preparations.
a total of 2520 patients with activated osteoarthritis and other rheumatoid diseases were included
in this trial. compared with rofecoxib,  xxxd2508xxx 
showed a comparably good tolerability with slight

233

advantages and a markedly better efficacy with respect to pain reduction and symptom scores for
morning stiffness. these results are particularly impressive in the light of the fact that the apparent
particular advantage of selective cox-2 inhibitors
is their good tolerability. this advantage could not
be confirmed for rofecoxib in the present investigation. moreover, the total number of adverse events
that occurred were statistically less frequent with
 xxxd2508xxx , whereas gi adverse events showed a
small trend of being less frequent with rofecoxib.
this is in line with a more favourable judgement of
tolerability of  xxxd2508xxx  by patients. the different
number of patients in the two groups had no influence on the interpretation of clinical differences
because of the large sample size.
daily dosage of the drugs was on the basis of the
individual clinical status in the range of the doserecommendations in the package-leaflet determined
by the physicians. more patients in the  xxxd2508xxx 
group were treated with half of the doses (35%) than
in the rofecoxib group (25%). the variable doses
may of course have had an influence on efficacy and
safety. on the other hand, individual dosage was

carried out in both groups and reflects the clinical
situation.

other hand, 6% of the rofecoxib-patients had to be
treated with double the recommended daily dosage.

the recommended daily dosage of 8mg twice
daily was administered to nearly 56% of  xxxd2508xxx -treated patients; in approximately 35% of the
cases half of the recommended daily dosage was
sufficient. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study the analgesic efficacy of  xxxd2508xxx  was investigated after tooth extraction.[13]  xxxd2508xxx  given in dosages of between 4 and 32mg daily showed a
dose-dependent effect with respect to strength and
duration of analgesic effect. dosages of 16 and
32mg were significantly effective, whereas the difference with the 8mg dose was not significant. a
daily dose of 16mg showed better tolerability than
32mg. ketorolac 10 mg/day was co-investigated for
comparative purposes, and the results obtained for
strength and duration of analgesic effect were in
between those obtained for  xxxd2508xxx  8 and
16mg.[13]

of note, all improvements in efficacy parameters
were clinically relevant in each treatment group and
statistically significantly superior in the  xxxd2508xxx 
group. pain on movement, at rest and at night was
reduced by around 42–45% by rofecoxib, whereas
improvements after  xxxd2508xxx  exceeded those effects significantly and reached between 56% and
60%. this is in line with the fact that nearly three
times as many patients discontinued rofecoxib treatment due to lack of efficacy (8.9% versus 3.4%).

twenty-five percent of the patients in the
rofecoxib group received 12.5mg daily, almost 64%
were treated with the maximum dose of 25mg, and
6% required an increased dosage of 50mg daily. in a
randomised, double-blind trial, 382 patients with
osteoarthritis of the knee were treated with rofecoxib (12.5 and 25 mg/day), celecoxib (200 mg/day) or
paracetamol (4000 mg/day).[14] efficacy assessed in
the first 6 days of therapy showed the greatest response to rofecoxib 25 mg/day, followed by rofecoxib 12.5 mg/day, celecoxib and paracetamol, respectively, in terms of relief of pain on walking, rest/
night pain and morning stiffness. over 6 weeks
rofecoxib 25 mg/day provided the greatest response
for night pain, composite pain subscale, stiffness
subscale and physical function subscale. all treatments were generally safe and well tolerated.[14]
the different dosage instructions show that under
general practice conditions pain therapy is individually adjusted. of particular interest with respect to a
markedly better tolerability assessment of  xxxd2508xxx  compared with rofecoxib is that more than onethird of the  xxxd2508xxx -treated patients received
only half of the recommended daily dosage. on the

these results are comparable to those obtained
from a 12-week study performed in 135 patients
with arthritis. in this study administration of  xxxd2508xxx  4mg three times daily and 8mg twice daily
showed the same clinical efficacy (p < 0.33) as
diclofenac 50mg three times daily.[15] parameters of
clinical symptoms were reduced in each of the
groups by 42–48%, and a subjective improvement
of the symptomatology was reported by 80–89% of
all patients. in the course of a subsequent 40-week
follow-up treatment the clinical effects remained
stable, with a further pain reduction of up to 23%.[13]
in a one-year clinical study the efficacy of rofecoxib
(12.5 and 25 mg/day) and diclofenac (50mg three
times daily) was investigated in 784 patients with
arthritis of the knee or the hips.[16] the efficacy and
tolerability of the two preparations were comparable, whereas diclofenac showed slight statistical
advantages in two of three endpoints (patient assessment of efficacy and medical judgement of clinical
picture) when compared with rofecoxib 25mg. in
another randomised, double-blind trial with 809
adults with osteoarthritis, the clinical efficacy and
tolerability of rofecoxib (12.5 and 25 mg/day) and
ibuprofen (800mg three times a day) were compared
for 6 weeks.[17] both dosages of rofecoxib demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with ibuprofen as assessed by three endpoints (pain on walking,
patient global assessment of response to therapy,
and investigator global assessment). all groups provided significantly (p < 0.001) greater efficacy than
placebo and the overall incidence rates of clinical

 xxxd2508xxx  vs rofecoxib in activated osteoarthritis

adverse experiences were not significantly different
(p < 0.05).
further advantages of  xxxd2508xxx  were obvious
in terms of a reduction in the duration of morning
stiffness, with a significantly (p < 0.001) more pronounced reduction of 66.6% by  xxxd2508xxx  compared with 50.2% by rofecoxib. similar results were
obtained in a study performed by caruso et al.[18] a
total of 316 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were
treated with either  xxxd2508xxx  12 mg/day or diclofenac 150 mg/day. morning stiffness was reduced
by 66% with  xxxd2508xxx  and by 70% with diclofenac. when the restriction caused by morning stiffness was assessed,  xxxd2508xxx  achieved the following results: moderate restrictions were reduced by
25%, and severe restrictions by 11%. given in absolute figures this means that 219  xxxd2508xxx  recipients were affected by severe restrictions before the
onset of therapy, and after therapy only 12 patients
were affected by severe restrictions. of the 36% of
the rofecoxib recipients who initially complained
about moderate restrictions, approximately 15% remained affected; severe restrictions were reduced by
9%.
the tolerability of  xxxd2508xxx  is also superior to
that of rofecoxib, since more than twice as many
patients reported adverse events during intake of the
selective cox-2 inhibitor. accordingly, half of the
patients judged  xxxd2508xxx  as being excellently tolerated compared with a little more than one-third
(38%) for rofecoxib. physicians’ judgements only
differed slightly from patients’ assessments. with its
short plasma elimination half-life of 4h,  xxxd2508xxx 
contributes to a good tolerability, since while the
analgesic effects are still evident, protective prostaglandins may recover.[3] severe adverse events did
not occur in any case.
nsaid-typical adverse events such as diarrhoea,
nausea, hypertension, retching and gi disturbances
occurred with  xxxd2508xxx  therapy. typical gi
symptoms, however, occurred somewhat less frequently during treatment with rofecoxib. in the
rofecoxib group other adverse events such as nausea, heartburn, gastritis, hypertension, mucosa vesicle and a haemorrhagic duodenal ulcer were docu© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

mented. buttgereit et al. also discussed adverse
events that mostly affect the gi tract.[18] similar
results were obtained in this study with rofecoxib
and diclofenac; the adverse event rate and the nature
of adverse events did not differ between rofecoxib
12.5mg and diclofenac 150mg. the most frequent
adverse events were disorders of the upper respiratory tract and sinusitis, and disorders of the gi tract
such as nausea, diarrhoea and heartburn. with respect to the development of ulcers, no statistically
significant differences were observed between
rofecoxib (0.8%) and diclofenac (1.2%) treatment,[17] while in the present study a haemorrhagic
duodenal ulcer only developed following treatment
with rofecoxib. the influence of celecoxib and
rofecoxib on the blood pressure of elderly hypertensive osteoarthritis patients was investigated in a
clinical study.[19] with both treatments oedema and
a significant increase in systolic and a slight increase
in diastolic blood pressure occurred, and rofecoxib
was more effective than celecoxib. these results
have been confirmed in three case reports.[20]
these results imply that selective inhibition of
cox-2 may have some benefits in terms of less
frequent adverse events of the gi tract when compared with a non-selective nsaid. general tolerability is, however, not improved, being inferior in
terms of this direct comparison between rofecoxib
and  xxxd2508xxx , when lack of efficacy is included in
the adverse events as documented by the participating physicians. any advantages of gi tolerability
claimed for rofecoxib are at the expense of poorer
clinical efficacy. thus, relevant inhibition of cox-1
seems to be important for adequate analgesic and
anti-inflammatory effects.
conclusion
in conclusion, this direct comparison of cox-2
selective and non-selective nsaids revealed clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority
for all endpoints for efficacy of  xxxd2508xxx  versus
rofecoxib. both drugs were well tolerated, but benefits in tolerability of the selective cox-2 inhibitor
could not be confirmed.
