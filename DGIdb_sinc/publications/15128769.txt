ften, the embryo has been referred to as “the mating
product of histoincompatible individuals,” and– consequently–was compared with a semiallogeneic graft having to be tolerated by the maternal immune system over the full
gestational period (1).
the spatial adjacencies between fetal and maternal tissues guarantee nourishment of the fetus and the placenta, which is composed of fetal and maternal structures and an area for intense exchanges for nutrients and oxygen (1). in contrast, due to the
presence of paternal ags expressed by the placenta, rejection via
the maternal immune system has to be avoided (2–5). published
data indicate that– during pregnancy–the maternal immune system
appears to be “aware” of the fetal ags, thus, tolerance mechanisms
have evolved during evolution to ensure the maintenance of the
fetoplacental graft (6).
however, rejection of the fetus and subsequent miscarriages are
a frequent pregnancy complication affecting 15– 40% of human
pregnancies (7, 8). inevitably, the fetoplacental graft may thus either be tolerated or rejected by the maternal immune system. the

pathways of fetal tolerance appear to be plural and matter at diverse times in gestation. intriguingly, these tolerance mechanisms
act systemically on the maternal immune system and locally at the
placental level. indeed, the decision of survival or rejection of the
fetus is particularly dependent on the events endangering the mother,
prevalently environmental parameters such as exposure to toxic substances, infectious agents, or psychoemotional stress (9).
systemic effects of fetal tolerance are first and foremost mediated
by immunoactive hormones, e.g., progesterone, the hormone of pregnancy. in humans, progesterone-receptor antagonists promptly induce
abortion if given before 7 wk of gestation (10). likewise, surgical
removal of the source of progesterone, the corpus luteum, results in
pregnancy loss in rodents (11–14), suggesting that adequate progesterone production is critical to the maintenance of pregnancy.
interestingly, psychoemotional stress is known to generally inhibit
the female reproductive system primarily through inhibition of
progesterone (15, 16).
locally at the fetomaternal interface, numerous mechanisms are
involved and prevalently intertwined, e.g., expression of mhc
class i is reduced on the syncytiotrophoblast, and the specific expression of hla-g and hla-e may block the cytolytic activity of
nk cells (17, 18). further, indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase, which
catabolizes tryptophan, can be detected at the fetomaternal interface and has recently been reported to famish the local maternal
immune response by depriving the t cells of tryptophan and/or by
inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation (19, 20).
recent evidence, much of it emerging from research on animal
models, indicates important roles for t cells and cytokines in causing pregnancy failure (4, 21–24). it has been proposed that an
inflammatory response mediated by macrophages, nk cells, and t
cells with increased levels of th1 cytokines may mediate abortions
(25, 26). based on the observations of deleterious effects of

one of the most remarkable immunological regulations is the maternal immune tolerance toward the fetal semiallograft during
pregnancy, which has been referred to as immunity’s pregnant pause. rejection of the semiallogeneic trophoblast cells must be
selectively inhibited and pathways presumably include th2 cytokines unopposed by th1 cytokines. steroid hormones, including
progesterone, have similar effects. low levels of progesterone and th2 cytokines and high levels of th1 cytokines are attributable
for increased abortions in mammalians, which may be triggered by psychoemotional stress. thus, the aim of the present study was
to provide experimental evidence for the mechanism involved in the mediation of immune responses by endocrine signals during
pregnancy and stress-triggered pregnancy failure. dba/2j-mated cba/j female mice were randomized in three groups: 1) control
females, 2) mice exposed to stress on gestation day 5.5, and 3) mice exposed to stress and substituted with  xxxd1957xxx , a
progestogen with a binding profile highly selective for the  xxxg1737xxx  on gestation day 5.5. on gestation days 7.5, 9.5,
and 10.5, mice of each group were sacrificed, and the frequency of cd8ⴙ cells and cytokine expression (il-4, il-12, tnf-␣, ifn-␥)
in blood and uterus cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. additionally, some mice were depleted of cd8 cells by injection of mab.
we observed that progesterone substitution abrogated the abortogenic effects of stress exposure by decreasing the frequency of
abortogenic cytokines. this pathway was exceedingly cd8-dependent, because depletion of cd8 led to a termination of the
pregnancy protective effect of progesterone substitution. the journal of immunology, 2004, 172: 5893–5899.

depletion of cd8⫹ cells in progesterone substitution

th1-type cytokines on mammalian pregnancy and on observations
that pregnancy appears to be associated with a down-regulation of
cell-mediated immunity manifested as reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity, it has been suggested that the th1/th2 balance
could be a critical and a complex factor in the tolerance of the
conceptus (8).
data have indicated that a shift of th1 to th2 cytokines and
suppression of nk cell cytolytic activity may be under the control
of an immunomodulatory protein known as progesterone-induced
blocking factor (pibf)3 (27). pibf is secreted by t cells, predominantly ␥␦ tcr⫹ and cd8⫹ (24), upon interaction of progesterone
with the progesterone receptors on such cells (28).
in successful pregnancies after immunotherapy (using the male
partner’s blood as the source of leukocytes), systemic cd8⫹ progesterone-receptor⫹ cells were found to be significantly increased
compared with preimmunotherapy (29). because much of our understanding of early human pregnancy is inferred from studies in
animals, we recently performed a pilot study to investigate the
effect of the progesterone derivative  xxxd1957xxx  ( xxxd1957xxx ), a progesterone with a binding profile highly
selective for the  xxxg1737xxx  (30), in stress-triggered murine abortion (31) and observed that stressed animals present lower
systemic levels of progesterone and pibf and a reduced expression of  xxxg1737xxx  at the fetomaternal interface (30).
injection of  xxxd1957xxx  increased levels of plasma pibf in
stressed mice, but did not affect progesterone levels.
based on the notion that stress perception decreased levels of
progesterone which in turn may result in a th1⬎th2 predominance with consecutive abortion, we now investigated– upon confirming that stress during early gestation (day 5.5) boosts the abortion rate, which can be abrogated by the progesterone derivative
 xxxd1957xxx –whether 1) the percentage of cd8⫹ uterine cells
was affected in stressed mice with and without  xxxd1957xxx 
treatment over a period of 5 days after stress exposure, 2) the
relative numbers of th1 (tnf-␣, ifn-␥, il-12) and th2 (il-4)
cytokine-producing cells in the uterus would be affected by stress

or  xxxd1957xxx  treatment, respectively, and 3) depletion of
cd8⫹ cells by injection of anti-lyt 2.1 ab would abolish the protective effect of  xxxd1957xxx  on the abortion rate in stressed
mice by affecting the th1/th2 cytokine profile.

materials and methods
animals
mice were purchased from charles river breeding laboratories (sulzfeld,
germany) and maintained in an animal facility with a 12 h light/dark cycle.
animal care and experimental procedures were followed according to institutional guidelines and conformed to the requirements of the state authority for animal research conduct (lagetsi, berlin, germany). dba/2jmated cba/j female mice were randomized in different groups of females:
1) control mice that received s.c. injection of sterile filtered sesame oil (200
␮l) on gestation day 5.5. the mice were sacrificed either on gestation day
7.5 (n ⫽ 7), 9.5 (n ⫽ 7), 10.5 (n ⫽ 7), or 13.5 (n ⫽ 7) for evaluation of
the abortion rate and number of implants; 2) mice that were exposed to
sound stress on gestation day 5.5 and also received a s.c. injection of 200
␮l of sterile filtered sesame oil. again, the mice were sacrificed either on
gestation day 7.5 (n ⫽ 7), 9.5 (n ⫽ 7), 10.5 (n ⫽ 7), or 13.5 (n ⫽ 7) for
evaluation of the abortion rate and number of implants; 3) mice that were
exposed to stress on gestation day 5.5 and received a s.c. injection of
 xxxd1957xxx  (provided by solvay pharmaceutical, hannover, germany)
at a concentration of 1.25 mg/200 ␮l of sterile filtered sesame oil on gestation day 5.5, before exposure to sound stress was commenced. as in 1)
and 2), the mice were sacrificed either on gestation day 7.5 (n ⫽ 7), 9.5
(n ⫽ 7), 10.5 (n ⫽ 7), and 13.5 (n ⫽ 7) for evaluation of the abortion rate
and number of implants; 4) in a second experiment, an additional group of
mice (n ⫽ 20) was treated as in 3), and divided into two subgroups (n ⫽
10 each) which received s.c. injection of anti-lyt 2.1 (cat. no. 558733) (85
␮g/200 ml pbs) cd8 depletion on day 6.5 or pbs alone. because we knew
from the previous experiments on the mice described in 1)-3) that gestation
day 7.5 was a crucial day with respect to changes of the uterine cytokine
equilibrium, we exclusively focused on the presence of cytokines on this
particular day in the cd8 depletion experiments in five mice per subgroup
in addition to the evaluation of the abortion rate and number of implants on
day 13.5 (n ⫽ 5 for each subgroup).

abortion rate

statistical analysis

mice were sacrificed by neck dislocation on day 13.5, the uteri were removed, and the total number of implantations and resorbing sites (signs of
abortion) was recorded. the abortion rate was calculated as percentages of
resorption sites calculated from total number of implantations based on the
following formula: % abortion rate ⫽ a/(a ⫹ v) ⫻ 100, whereby a means
the number of dead placental units and v means viable placental units.

statistical significance was determined using the nonparametric mannwhitney u test. significance was set at p ⬍ 0.05.

blood cells
on gestation days 7.5, 9.5, and 10.5, mice of the respective groups were
narcotized and blood cells were obtained by retro-orbital punction and
collected in tubes containing heparin. after treatment with ammonium
chloride lysis buffer for 10 min to deplete erythrocytes, the cells were
washed twice with sterile pbs.
blood cells were used for determination of phenotype (surface expression) and cytokine expression on cells by flow cytometry.

results
stress-triggered increase of the abortion rate could be
abrogated by the progesterone derivative  xxxd1957xxx 
as depicted in fig. 1a, we reproduced our previous findings that
exposure to stress on gestation day 5.5 significantly boosts the
abortion rate in dba/2j-mated cba/j females, as analyzed on
gestation day 13.5, when resorption ⫽ abortion sites are visible
(31). further, substitution of progesterone with 1.25 mg of  xxxd1957xxx  on gestation day 5.5 significantly abrogated the stresstriggered increase of abortions. neither stress nor  xxxd1957xxx 

uterus cell isolation
uteri were removed and uterus cells were isolated by the method described
by marquez et al. (32), with some modifications. in brief, the uterus was
washed with sterile pbs, carefully cut into small pieces, and collected in
tubes containing hbss and digested for 20 min at 37°c under slight
agitation in hbss with 1 mm dtt (cat. no. d-0632; sigma-aldrich,
munich, germany). after that, the isolated cells were collected in a fresh
tube through a 100-␮m net (bd biosciences, san francisco, ca) and
washed with rpmi 1640 complemented with 10% fcs. the procedure
was repeated twice, with hbss medium containing no dtt. mononuclear
cells were purified by lympholyte/m (cat. no. gts5030xk; cedarlane
laboratories, hornby, ontario, canada) gradient centrifugation. these
cells were used to characterize surface and intracellular expression by flow
cytometry.

flow cytometric analysis
for flow cytometry, the blood and uterus cells were incubated for 3 h with
brefeldin a (106 cells/ml medium with 1 ␮l of golgi plug, 55-2301kz; bd
pharmingen, heidelberg, germany) in rpmi 1640 with fcs in a humidified incubator at 37°c with 5%co2. flow cytometry was performed using
our standard protocol (31): briefly, uterus cells were washed twice with
facs buffer (pbs supplemented with 1% bsa (cat. no. a-9418; sigmaaldrich) and 0.1% sodium acide (sigma-aldrich)). cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature (rt) with fitc-labeled ab against

differential expression of cd8⫹ uterus cells in stressed mice
now, we wished to determine the relative number of uterine cd8⫹
cells, because this population has been suggested to have a crucial
role in pregnancy maintenance (8, 29, 33). as shown in fig. 3a,
stressed mice presented a significant decrease of the percentage of
cd8⫹ uterus cells, as analyzed by flow cytometry, on day 7.5 of
gestation compared with control mice. strikingly, in stressed mice
which received  xxxd1957xxx , the percentage of cd8⫹ uterus
cells had been restored back to levels seen in control mice. interestingly, on day 9.5, mice exposed to stress presented a significantly higher percentage of cd8⫹ uterus cells, compared with
control or stressed and  xxxd1957xxx -treated mice. however, the
percentages of cd8⫹ cells where at a lower level, compared with
day 7.5 of gestation. on gestation day 10.5, we observed that the
significant differences between the percentages of cd8⫹ uterine
cells in the groups tested were no longer detectable.
we further looked at the expression of cd8 in the peripheral
blood cells by flow cytometry and found no significant effect of
stress or  xxxd1957xxx  treatment with respect to cd8⫹ cells (table i).
influence of stress and  xxxd1957xxx  treatment on cytokine
profile in uterus cells
as mentioned earlier, th2-like cytokines appear to contribute to
the maintenance of pregnancy, whereas th1 cytokines have been
shown to be deleterious for pregnancy. in the present study, we
observed that on gestation day 7.5 and 9.5, stressed mice showed
a significantly increased percentage tnf-␣⫹ uterus cells (fig. 4).
on gestation day 10.5, 5 days after stress exposure, levels of
tnf-␣ were back to the percentage seen in control mice. interestingly, injection of  xxxd1957xxx  significantly lowered the relative number of tnf-␣-producing uterine cells on days 7.5, 9.5,
and even on 10.5. the absolute numbers of cd8⫹/tnf-␣⫹ uterus
cells are presented in table ii.
further, we investigated the presence of the th1 cytokines
ifn-␥ and il-12 in uterus cells. as depicted in fig. 5, nonstressed
mice presented a significantly greater percentage of ifn-␥⫹ cells
immediately after stress exposure, on gestation day 7.5, compared
with stressed as well as stressed  xxxd1957xxx -treated mice.
however, on day 9.5, when the percentages in controls significantly decreased compared with day 7.5, this th1 down-regulation

was not present in stressed mice. when the stressed mice were
treated with  xxxd1957xxx , ifn-␥ down-regulation did occur in
uterine cells. on day 10.5, significant differences with respect to
ifn-␥⫹ uterus cells were no longer detectable as the relative number was rather low compared with day 7.5. the absolute numbers
of cd8⫹/ifn-␣⫹ and il-12⫹uterus cells are presented in table ii.
when looking at il-12 expression in uterus cells, we observed
no significant differences between the three groups and the different days of gestation (fig. 6).
as presented in fig. 7, stressed mice treated with  xxxd1957xxx  showed significantly higher percentages of pregnancy protective il-4⫹ uterus cells beginning on gestation day 7.5 and, even
more strikingly, maintained until day 10.5. the absolute numbers
of cd8⫹/il-4⫹ uterus cells are presented in table ii.
depletion of cd8⫹ cells abolished the protective effect of
 xxxd1957xxx  on the abortion rate in stressed mice by
affecting the th1/th2 cytokine profile
to investigate whether the protective effect of progesterone substitution with  xxxd1957xxx  may be mediated by cd8⫹ cells, we
specifically depleted this cell population using a mab (33). as
presented in fig. 1b, we observed that the decrease of stress-triggered abortion in  xxxd1957xxx -treated mice could be significantly abrogated if these mice have been cd8-depleted. further,

the  xxxd1957xxx -induced down-regulation of the th1 cytokines
tnf-␣, ifn-␥, and il-12 present in uterus cells has been abolished in the cd8-depleted mice (fig. 8a). depletion of uterine
cd8⫹ cells by injection of lyt 2.1 has been confirmed by flow

discussion
it is well known that progesterone mediates effects which are beneficial for the onset, development, and maintenance of pregnancy
(10 –14). in contrast, stress interferes with the course of pregnancy
and may lead to abortions, putatively via decrease of progesterone
(15, 16). previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that
stress-triggered abortion can be therapeutically approached by application of a progesterone derivative (31).
in this study, we now deliver evidence that stress exposure induces a decrease of uterine cd8⫹ cells within 24 h. this decrease
can be restored by application of the progesterone derivative  xxxd1957xxx , an observation which is clearly in agreement with
the observations of a pregnancy protective cd8⫹ t cell subpopulation preventing abortion, which are present between days 4.5 and
8.5 of gestation (8, 33). these cd8⫹ cells, which have been suggested to coexpress the ␥␦ tcr, appear to play a crucial role in
th1/th2 balance (8, 34), which determines success and failure of
pregnancy. because we were able to restore this population by
 xxxd1957xxx , it appears that these cells are highly regulated by
adequate levels of progesterone and express progesterone receptors. in our cd8 depletion experiments, we observed that the pregnancy protective effect of  xxxd1957xxx  treatment with respect to
the abortion rate is almost abolished, thus, we conclude that the
protective effect of progesterone and  xxxd1957xxx  is predominantly mediated by uterine cd8⫹ cells (fig. 9).
interestingly, the population of uterine cd8⫹ cells changes subsequently (gestation days 9.5 and 10.5) from pregnancy protective
to abortogenic, suggesting the presence of different functional subpopulations of uterine cd8⫹ cells throughout gestation. functional cd8 is a dimeric protein made of either two ␣-chains
(cd8␣␣) or an ␣-chain and a ␤-chain (cd8␣␤) (35–37). importantly, cd8␣␣ and cd8␣␤ are differentially expressed on a variety of lymphocytes. cd8␣␤ is expressed predominantly on the

surface of ␣␤tcr⫹ t cells and thymocytes (38 – 41). expression
of cd8␣␣ has been identified on a subset of ␥␦ tcr⫹ intestinal
intraepithelial lymphocytes, nk cells, dendritic cells, and a small
fraction of cd4⫹ t cells, but ␣␣-chains are essentially absent on
cells of the circulation (41– 44). the differential distributions of
cd8␣␣ and cd8␣␤ suggest that these two forms of cd8 are
likely to mediate distinct functions. based on the experimental
set-up in our present study, we cannot differentiate whether the
cd8 cells express an ␣␣ or ␣␤-chain. however, from preliminary
results, we know that ⬃25% of uterine cd8 cells also express
 xxxg1208xxx , thus belonging to the family of uterine dendritic cells. the
percentage of cd8⫹/ xxxg1208xxx ⫹ cells slightly diminished with stress
and could be restored by  xxxd1957xxx  application (data not
shown). gorczynski et al. (45) suggested that cd8⫹ ␥␦ t suppressor cells and cd8␣␣ indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase-producing
suppressor cells could be stimulated by cd200⫹cd8⫺ dendritic

depletion of cd8⫹ cells in progesterone substitution

cells. these cd8⫹ cells represent an important subset for the induction of cytokines such as il-4, il-10, and tgf-␤ that inhibit
macrophages, tcr ␣␤⫹ cells and nk or nk ␥␦t cells, which
produce ifn-␥, tnf-␣, and il-12 and induce placental hemorrhage by up-regulation of fgl2⫺  xxxg741xxx  (25). however,
cd8 depletion did not entirely abrogate the protective effect of
progesterone and mimicked an abortion rate as seen in the stressed
mice. this could be due to cellular infiltration of the fetomaternal
interface by  xxxg1737xxx -negative macrophages and nk
cells, which are also capable of producing high levels of abortogenic
cytokines. another possible reason may be the existence of a t regulatory cell subpopulation, e.g., johansson et al. (46) recently described a novel population of small cd3⫹b220lowcd4⫺cd8⫺ t
cells in the mouse female genital tract with regulatory functions.
the evaluation of il-4-producing cells in blood and uterus revealed that the percentage of cells producing il-4 was increased in
 xxxd1957xxx -treated stressed mice compared with control or
stressed mice. this dramatic increase may be due to the mediating
effect of increased pibf or a direct effect of  xxxd1957xxx  on
cytokine production, similar to the effect of progesterone itself as
demonstrated by piccinni (47). it has been highly accepted that
progesterone induces the production of th2 cytokines in vivo and
vitro (24, 27, 28). szekeres-bartho and colleagues and the margni
group (48, 49) report that progesterone induces the secretion of
pibf through lymphocytes and may be involved in the synthesis of
asymmetric abs. pibf has an antiabortive effect by suppressing
nk activity and increases the secretion of th2 cytokines by immunosuppressor cells (8, 22, 24). in our previous experiment, we
further observed that pibf levels were decreased after stress exposure and could be restored by treatment of  xxxd1957xxx  (31).
in our present study using flow cytometry, we observed that the
population of tnf-␣⫹ uterus cells increases after stress exposure,
compared with the control group. this stress effect can be counteracted by  xxxd1957xxx  treatment. this result confirms the notion of th1 cytokines deleterious for pregnancy maintenance (21).
indeed, other th1 cytokines, e.g., ifn-␥, increased after stress
exposure in murine matings (23, 50). interestingly, tangri and
raghupathy (51) demonstrated that the placenta of an abortionprone mating such as cba/j ⫻ dba/2j produced high levels of
tnf-␣ and ifn-␥, whereas in low abortion mating, e.g., cba/j ⫻
balb/c, il-10 is dominant. however, based on recent publica-

tions, the th1/th2 paradigm has been frequently challenged of late
(52, 53), pointing toward the importance for future research in
reproductive immunology to deliver additional experimental
evidence.
in our present experiments, the percentage of il-12-producing
uterus cells did not change over the days investigated in the various groups, bringing into question the function of il-12 as a th1
inducer on the uterine level. we suggest that the physiologic function of il-12 in pregnancy may rather be around the time of blastocyst adhesion, and additional studies are necessary to elucidate
the role of this cytokine in the regulation of the immune system
during pregnancy maintenance.
in conclusion, our data imply that stress leads to increased abortions by an alteration of the hormonal system with a consecutive
dysregulation of the th1/th2 ration via cd8⫹ cell-dependent
pathways. progesterone substitution by  xxxd1957xxx  can abrogate this effect by inducing a pregnancy protective th2-biased immune response in the decidua.

figure 9. synopsis of endocrine-immune bidirectionality in stress-triggered abortion. hypothetical scenario of the mechanism involved in endocrine-immune
bidirectionality during pregnancy. a, in normally progressing pregnancies, adequate levels of progesterone
led to a predominance of pregnancy protective cytokines, possibly via pibf secreted by uterine cd8⫹
cells, which results in fetal tolerance and pregnancy
maintenance. b, in stressed pregnant individuals, levels
of progesterone are inadequate and consequently, pibf
is diminished and th1 cytokines prevail, which results
in fetal rejection and pregnancy failure. c, substitution
of progesterone in stressed individuals, e.g., through
 xxxd1957xxx  application, restores the pregnancy protective pibf and th2 predominance and consequently,
stress-triggered abortions are abrogated and fetal tolerance ensured.
