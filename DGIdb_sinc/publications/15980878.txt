adenosine is a powerful bronchoconstrictor of asthmatic, but not normal, airways. in vitro studies on
isolated human mast cells and basophils revealed that adenosine and selective analogues augmented
inflammatory mediator release from mast cells by stimulating a2 receptors. pharmacological blockade
of mast cell mediator release in vivo also attenuated adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction, as did
theophylline, by adenosine a2 receptor antagonism. further in vitro studies revealed that the
asthmatic response to adenosine is likely to be mediated via the a2b subtype which is selectively
antagonised by  xxxd1999xxx . studies in animal models, especially mice, have shown a close synergistic
interaction between adenosine, th2 and airway remodelling responses. the recent description of a2b
receptors on human airway smooth muscle cells that mediate cytokine and chemokine release and
induce differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts strengthens the view that adenosine maybe
more than an inflammatory mediator in asthma but also participates in airway wall remodelling in this
disease. these data have provided a firm basis for developing  xxxg83xxx  antagonists as a
new therapeutic approach to this disease.

early observations
adenosine is a  xxxd2705xxx  that plays a key role in
nucleic acid, energy and protein metabolism. as an extracellular autacoid generated by 50 -nucleoside cleavage of
adenosine 50 -monophosphate, it is a powerful mediator acting
through specific cell surface purinoreceptors. in 1978, while
working as a post-doctoral research fellow in dr frank
austen’s laboratory at harvard university, i showed that
adenosine and related synthetic analogues were potent agents
in augmenting ige-dependent mediator release from isolated
rodent mast cells (holgate et al., 1980). on returning to the
uk in 1980, i set about exploring whether adenosine had any
role as a mediator of asthma. in 1983, michael cushley, a
clinical research fellow, demonstrated that inhaled adenosine
(but not its metabolite inosine or the unrelated nucleoside
guanosine) was a powerful bronchoconstrictor of asthmatic
but, importantly, not of normal airways (cushley et al.,
1983b). further work showed that both allergic and nonallergic asthmatics responded in a similar way and that the
effect was also seen with adenosine 50 -monophosphate (amp)
and adenosine 50 -diphosphate (adp) (mann et al., 1986b). a
detectable, but lesser response of the lower airways was also
observed in patients with allergic rhinitis (phillips et al., 1990).
however, when adenosine was injected intradermally into
atopic skin, the vasodilator and small wheal response was no

different from that observed in nonatopic skin (djukanovic
et al., 1989). since asthma accompanies rhinitis in b80% of
patients, the intermediate airway response observed with
adenosine challenge in allergic rhinitis was most likely due to
concomitant mild asthma (djukanovic et al., 1992; doull
et al., 1996), but could not be explained by a generalised
increased responsiveness of epithelial surfaces in atopic
subjects. as amp was more soluble in an aqueous solvent
than adenosine, most of the future inhalation challenge work
was conducted using this nucleotide.
these preliminary observations led to the hypothesis that
‘adenosine, which accumulates in inflamed mucosa under
conditions of cell stress and hypoxia, contributes as a mediator
of bronchoconstriction in both acute and chronic asthma’. to
pursue this, we first demonstrated that following inhalation
allergen challenge of sensitised asthmatic subjects adenosine
was released into the circulation (mann et al., 1986a) and
locally into the airways (polosa et al., 1995). adenosine was
also shown to be released from antigen-challenged human lung
fragments in vitro in the presence of inhibitors of adenosine
deaminase and  xxxg79xxx  (konnaris & lloyd, 1996).
blockade of adenosine re-uptake by  xxxd1914xxx  increased
the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled amp, indicating
that accumulation of extracellular adenosine was closely
associated with the asthmatic airway response (cushley
et al., 1985). the ability of  xxxd1914xxx  to enhance another
adenosine-mediated effect was later shown in humans on the
hypercapnic ventilatory response, thereby confirming its mode

of action in vivo of increasing extracellular adenosine levels
(griffiths et al., 1990; 1997). in vitro studies confirmed that
adenosine and a2 receptor analogues (e.g. 50 -n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca)) could augment ige-dependent
mediator release from both human mast cells and basophils
(church et al., 1983; hughes et al., 1983; 1984) and that
activated leukocytes were a major source of extracellular
adenosine (mann et al., 1986c). adenosine also releases
histamine directly from human bronchoalveolar lavage mast
cells (forsythe et al., 1999).

mechanism(s) of adenosine-induced
bronchoconstriction
the possibility that adenosine caused bronchoconstriction in
asthma indirectly via mast cell activation as suggested by our
early in vitro studies was pursued in several ways. firstly, amp
provocation of asthmatic airways in vivo was accompanied by
a rise in circulating histamine levels (phillips et al., 1990).
secondly, the immediate bronchoconstriction provoked by
inhaled amp was shown to be antagonised by inhibiting the
effects of individual mast cell mediators using selective
histamine h1 antagonists (e.g. terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx ) (holgate, 1987; phillips et al., 1987; rafferty et al., 1987a, b;
phillips & holgate, 1989),  xxxg599xxx 
(cystlt1) antagonists (e.g. montelukast) (rorke et al., 2002)
and inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (e.g.  xxxd2141xxx  and
indomethacin) (crimi et al., 1989; phillips & holgate, 1989).
inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity ablates the production of
the powerful bronchoconstrictor mediator prostaglandin
(pg)d2 from activated mast cells. secondly, the mast cell
stabilising drugs  xxxd1763xxx  (richards et al., 1988;
phillips et al., 1989b; richards et al., 1989), nedocromil
sodium (phillips et al., 1989b; richards et al., 1989; summers
et al., 1990; church & holgate, 1993) and more recently
andolast (persiani et al., 2001) were shown to be powerful
inhibitors of amp-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma.
thirdly, when administered by inhalation, the loop diuretics
 xxxd2167xxx  and bumetanide also inhibited adenosine-provoked
bronchoconstriction through their known inhibitory effects
in ion channels on mast cells to reduce their threshold of
activation and mediator secretion (polosa et al., 1993a;
rajakulasingam et al., 1994; bradding et al., 2003; duffy
et al., 2004). heparin, a highly sulphated unbranched
glycosaminoglycan, when given by inhalation protects against
bronchoconstriction provoked by allergen and exercise
(ahmed et al., 1993; bowler et al., 1993) is also inhibitory
against amp challenge of the lower (polosa et al., 1997) and
upper (zang et al., 2004) airways, again through suppression
of mast cell mediator release.
in allergic asthmatics, amp-induced bronchoconstriction
with inhaled amp was more rapid in onset than that observed
with inhaled allergen, indicating that airway narrowing was
the consequence of rapid mast cell degranulation with release
of histamine and generation of newly formed eicosanoids –
 xxxg1073xxx  and ltc4 (cushley & holgate, 1985; phillips &
holgate, 1988a) rather than the additional induction of newly
formed cytokines and chemokines that are considered to
underpin the late phase allergen response (phillips & holgate,
1988b). the absence of a late-phase response with inhaled
amp provocation highlighted a fundamental difference in the
british journal of pharmacology vol 145 (8)

adenosine: a novel mediator and therapeutic target in asthma

way that adenosine and allergen interacted with airway mast
cells for mediator secretion (holgate et al., 1987; church &
holgate, 1988; holgate et al., 1988). blockade of muscarinic
cholinergic receptors using inhaled ipratropium bromide had
only minimal effect in antagonising bronchoconstriction
provoked by amp, leading to the conclusion that cholinergic
reflexes were of limited importance in mediating bronchoconstriction (mann et al., 1985; polosa et al., 1991). by contrast,
inhaled b2-agonists such as salbutamol had a powerful inhibitory
effect on amp-induced bronchoconstriction by serving as a
functional antagonist and as a direct inhibitor of human mast
cell activation–secretion coupling (phillips et al., 1990a).

unusual features of adenosine-induced
bronchoconstriction
several interesting features about the pro-asthmatic effect of
adenosine have emerged. repeated provocation of asthmatic
airways with inhaled amp led to the development of
tolerance, which took 6–8 h to recover (daxun et al., 1989).
of significance was the further finding that, while in this
refractory state, the airways were hyperresponsive to allergen
inhalation, suggesting that prior adenosine exposure had
produced mast cell priming as we had previously demonstrated
in vitro (holgate et al., 1980; church et al., 1983; hughes et al.,
1983; 1984; phillips et al., 1989a). bronchoconstriction
provoked by amp also rendered the airways refractory to
exercise and inhaled bradykinin and vice versa, but not to
 xxxd2586xxx  challenge, suggesting that the former stimuli
operated through a common mast cell-mediated mechanism
(finnerty et al., 1990; polosa et al., 1992). it has long been
known that exercise-induced asthma is a mast cell-dependent
phenomena (finnerty & holgate, 1990; 1993; roach et al.,
1998), but cross-tolerance between amp and bradykinin was
less easy to explain. we had shown that bradykinin caused
bronchoconstriction through activation of bradykinin b2
receptors (polosa & holgate, 1990) and that repeated
challenge with this peptide also rapidly led to the development
of tolerance (polosa et al., 1993b; rajakulasingam et al., 1993).
both bradykinin b2 and adenosine receptors have been
identified on mast cells (reissmann et al., 2000; sylvin et al.,
2001) and also on peptidergic nerves (fox et al., 1996; chung,
2002), raising the possibility that adenosine and bradykinin
share some common activation pathways possibly through
the release of neuropeptides such as  xxxg2240xxx  or other
neurokinins, which are known to activate mast cells for
mediator secretion (rajakulasingam et al., 1994).

adenosine receptors mediate the proasthmatic
response
early work on both rodent and human mast cells demonstrated that adenosine was a powerful stimulator of mast cell
and basophil adenylate cyclase to increase cellular levels of
cyclic 30 50 -amp operating through the a2 subtype of
purinoceptor (holgate et al., 1980; hughes et al., 1983; 1984;
church & holgate, 1993). shortly after describing the
bronchoconstrictor activity of adenosine, we demonstrated
that both inhaled (cushley et al., 1983a; 1984; holgate et al.,
1984) and oral theophylline were able to selectively antagonise
amp-induced bronchoconstriction beyond their ability to act

s.t. holgate

as functional antagonists (mann & holgate, 1985; church
et al., 1986). the fact that this occurred at drug concentrations
one order of magnitude lower than that required to inhibit
 xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase and in the same range as
therapeutic plasma concentrations of theophylline (holgate
et al., 1987) opened up the possibility that the known
antiasthmatic effect of methylxanthines could, in part, be
due to adenosine antagonism. this view was challenged when
 xxxd1999xxx  became available because it was shown that this
drug was a powerful inhibitor of  xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase but, different from theophylline, was devoid of a2
receoptor antagonism that had been linked to the diuretic
and cardiac arrhythmic properties of xanthines (lunell et al.,
1983; persson et al., 1986). thus, in the early 1990s, the idea
that adenosine was an important mediator of asthma was
being seriously eroded.
however, based on current in vitro pharmacology available
at the time, it had been assumed that adenosine was active
through a single a2 receptor linked to adenylate cyclase and
that was quite distinct from the other purinergic receptors that
responded more selectively to atp and utp (e.g. p2yand
p2x). however, a paradox that could not be explained was
how an agent which increased  xxxd1773xxx  within mast cells
and basophils could augment rather than inhibit mediator
release, as would be expected since increases in cyclic 30 50 amp produced by other agonists, for example, with b2adrenoceptor agonists (okayama & church, 1992) or pg e2
(peters et al., 1982) were strongly inhibitory for mediator
release. further clarity came with the discovery that adenosine
a2 receptors existed as two subtypes – a2a linked to adenylate
cyclase and involving gs coupling, and a2b linked to both
adenylate cyclase and the phosphatidyl trisphosphate ( xxxg1743xxx )calcium signalling pathway involving both gs and gq coupling
(feoktistov & biaggioni, 1995; feoktistov et al., 1998).
thus, while exhibiting no antagonist properties against
adenosine a2a receptors,  xxxd1999xxx  was shown to be a
highly selective, albeit weak, antagonist of a2b receptors
(feoktistov & biaggioni, 1995; kim et al., 2002; fan et al.,
2003). this critical observation helped explain our finding of a
preferential inhibitory effect of intravenous emprofylline on
amp-induced bronchoconstriction (clarke et al., 1989). the
identification of the  xxxg83xxx  subtype revitalised interest in
adenosine as a mediator of asthma and becoming a new
therapeutic target for this disease (feoktistov et al., 1998).
although most of the work identifying a2b receptors on
human mast cells was conducted on the hmc-1 mastocytosis
derived cell line, recently a2b receptors mediating enhanced
mediator release have also been found on mast cells dispersed
from human lung tissue (zhong h, personal communication).
in addition to causing mast cell mediator release, activation of
a2b receptors on hmc-1 cells cultured with human b cells
results in ig isotype, switching to ige involving costimulation
utilising cd40 and enhanced il-4 and il-13 secretion
(ryzhov et al., 2004).
with the identification of this new subclass of a2 receptors,
the ease with which repeated exposure to adenosine (and
amp) results in tolerance and cross-tolerance became of the
target of further study. the  xxxg83xxx  appears to be
regulated differently from many other g-protein-coupled
receptors. mundell and co-workers have shown that agonist
activation of a2b receptors results in arrestin-dependent
internalisation of the receptor complex with antisense neu-

tralisation of arrestin, resulting in loss of desensitisation
(mundell et al., 2000; matharu et al., 2001). recent work
has shown that human a2b receptors associate with intracellular signalling proteins other than g proteins such as
those containing pdz ( xxxg642xxx , dig 20-1) domains, and
more specifically with the pdz domain-containing protein
e3karp (sitaraman et al., 2002). this is known to interact
with ezrin/radixin/moesin (erm) proteins which in turn
interact with the actin cytoskeleton that control  xxxg83xxx 
trafficking. this molecular-based work provides a good
explanation for the ease with which  xxxg83xxx  stimulation
results in rapid and profound tachyphylaxis, and also for
cross-desensitisation between a2b and other g-proteincoupled receptors (sitaraman et al., 2000).
the first observation that inhaled corticosteroids were
highly active in rapidly suppressing amp-induced bronchoconstriction (doull et al., 1997; holgate et al., 2000) and the
recent demonstration that amp challenge induces eosinophil
influx into the airways (van den berge et al., 2004) further
strengthened interest of the role of  xxxg83xxx  in asthma. the
rapidity with which this occurs (wilson et al., 2003) suggests
that a unique effect of corticosteroids on the  xxxg83xxx 
internalisation mechanisms possibly involving the recently
described rapid steroid response receptor (long et al., 2005).

observation on the role of adenosine in animal
models
adenosine receptors are also involved in mediating bronchoconstriction in a number of animal models, but between
animal species there is heterogeneity of the receptors involved.
in the rabbit the airway response is mediated through a1
receptors (nyce & metzger, 1997), in the rat by a1, a2b and a3
receptors (pauwels & van der straeten, 1987) or an atyptical
adenosine receptor (hannon et al., 2002), in the guinea-pig by
a3 receptors (thorne et al., 1996) and in the mouse by a2b and
a3 receptors (fan et al., 2003). it has further been shown that
 xxxg62xxx  (ada)-deficient mice develop progressive lung inflammation which can be effectively reversed by
 xxxg62xxx  therapy and markedly reduced by
treatment with selective  xxxg83xxx  antagonists
(chunn et al., 2001). using mice lacking the  xxxg82xxx  and,
therefore, the adenylate cyclase signal associated with its
activation (ohta & sitkovsky, 2001), a key role for endogenously generated adenosine in providing a regulatory feedback
mechanism capable of limiting or terminating inflammatory
responses has been shown. in a rat ‘model’ of allergic asthma,
the a2a agonist cgs 21680 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity
similar to that of the corticosteroid, budesonide (fozard et al.,
2002). most recently, sun et al. (2005) have shown that the a1
receptor plays an anti-inflammatory role in the pulmonary
phenotype seen in ada-deficient mice. glaxosmithkline are
also investigating an inhaled a2a agonist gw328267x in both
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (luijk
et al., 2003), but this has recently been dropped from
development due to cardiovascular side effects. on the
proinflammatory side, the important influence that adenosine
has over asthma pathogenesis has recently received additional
support from the observation that, in dual transgenic mice,
adenosine and the pro-inflammatory and pro-remodelling
cytokine interluekin-13 interact synergistically (blackburn
british journal of pharmacology vol 145 (8)

1012

s.t. holgate

et al., 2003). since there is now good evidence to support the
involvement of  xxxg83xxx  in mast cell activation, promising
antagonists for this receptor are being developed, such as
ipdx (feoktistov et al., 2001), 8-spt, xac, cgs15493
(fozard et al., 2003) and cvt 6883. some of these are now
entering clinical trial in the long-term treatment of asthma
(fozard, 2003; wolber & fozard, 2005).

adenosine bronchoprovocation as a diagnostic
test
a second development from the adenosine research describes
in this brief review is the use of adenosine (or amp) inhalation
challenge as a diagnostic test for asthma where its specificity
and sensitivity appear to be superior to that of inhaled
histamine and  xxxd2586xxx  (holgate, 2002a; polosa et al.,
2002; joos et al., 2003). when compared to agents that
produce bronchconstriction directly such as  xxxd2586xxx ,
airway responsiveness to amp also seems to be more closely
associated with airway inflammation (van den berge et al.,
2001). in addition, amp responsiveness is also used as a test
for distinguishing asthma from copd (spicuzza et al., 2003).
since the airway response to amp is so sensitive to the effect
of inhaled corticosteroids and also is a good marker of disease
activity, amp bronchoprovocation has been suggested as
useful as a biomarker to assess disease control (lee et al., 2003;
prieto et al., 2003).

adenosine: a novel mediator and therapeutic target in asthma

concluding comments
over a span of 20 years, the initial observation of the unique
pro-asthmatic effects of inhaled adenosine has evolved to
provide the basis for a new asthma therapy as well as a
possible diagnostic test (holgate, 2002b; rorke & holgate,
2002). recently, inbe et al. (2004) has described a second novel
receptor p2y-15 for adenosine and amp on human mast cells,
but this has recently been challenged (abbracchio et al., 2005).
the recent discovery that a2b receptors are also functionally
active on human airway smooth muscle cells to enhance
cytokine and chemokine release (zhong et al., 2004a, b) and on
lung fibroblasts where they promote differentiation to a
myofibroblast phenotype (zhong et al., 2004b) adds to the
view that this receptor may be involved in airway wall
remodelling as well as in inflammation in asthma. the next 5
years will be critical in determining whether targeting the a2b
receptor will translate into clinical efficacy for patients with
chronic asthma.
