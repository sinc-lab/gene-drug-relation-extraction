the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase catalyses the oxygenation of
 xxxd208xxx , leading to the formation of prostaglandins.
recently two forms of cyclo-oxygenase have been described: a
constitutive ( xxxg1883xxx ) enzyme present in most cells and tissues,
and an inducible (cox-2) isoenzyme observed in many cells in
response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase (hcox-1 and hcox2) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus
expression system. hcox-1 had a specific activity of 18.8 ,umol
of 02/mg with a km of 13.8 ,um for  xxxd208xxx  and v.ax of
1500 nmol of 02/nmol of enzyme, whereas  xxxg1884xxx  had a

specific activity of 12.2 ,umol of 02/mg with a km of 8.7 4am for
 xxxd208xxx  and a v"ax of 1090 nmol of 02/nmol of enzyme.
indomethacin inhibited both hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx , whereas
ns-398 and dup-697 selectively inhibited  xxxg1884xxx . both ns-398
and dup-697 exhibited time-dependent inactivation of  xxxg1884xxx ,
as did indomethacin on both enzymes. the competitive inhibitor
of hcox-1,  xxxd2556xxx  acid, also displayed competitive inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx . these results demonstrate the ability to
generate selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.

introduction

such as the stomach and kidney (via  xxxg1883xxx ). it is possible that
a selective cox-2 inhibitor may eliminate the side effects
associated with  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition while providing antiinflammatory cox-2 inhibition.
ram seminal vesicle has provided a rich source of  xxxg1883xxx 
that allows the ready purification of the enzyme from the native
sources (hemler et al., 1976; miyamoto et al., 1976; van der
ouderaa et al., 1977). sufficient amounts of  xxxg1883xxx  have been
purified from ram seminal vesicles for crystallography (picot and
garavito, 1989) and other experiments utilizing large quantities
of enzyme. on the other hand, a rich source of the native  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme has not been identified, although small amounts of the
rat enzyme have been purified (sirois and richards, 1992).
the baculovirus expression system has been used to express a
wide variety of proteins that are often enzymically, immunologically and functionally similar to their authentic counterparts
(luckow, 1991). the insect cell expression of sheep  xxxg1883xxx  has
been reported (shimokawa and smith, 1992). we report the
expression and purification of both human (h) cox- i and  xxxg1884xxx  from insect cells, using recombinant baculoviruses. the availability of these purified enzymes has permitted us to evaluate
selective inhibitors of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2.

the formation of prostaglandins (pgs) is initiated by the action
of pg synthase, which catalyses two separate reactions, the first
being the oxygenation of  xxxd208xxx  to the unstable pgg2
by a cyclo-oxygenase function and the second the further
conversion of pgg2 into the more stable pgh2 by a peroxidase
function. hence, this 'cyclo-oxygenase' (cox) enzyme performs
the critical initial reaction in the arachidonic metabolic cascade
leading to the formation of the prostaglandins, thromboxane
and prostacyclin (needleman et al., 1986). aspirin and other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit pg
formation by inactivation of the cox enzyme (smith and willis,
1971; vane, 1971; vane and bottin, 1987). originally thought to
be a single enzyme, cox was known to produce both proinflammatory pgs at the site of inflammation and homoeostatic
pgs in tissues such as the stomach and kidney. these homoeostatic pgs are linked to normal gastric and renal function
(haynes, 1990).
recently, a second form of the cox enzyme was isolated
whose expression is inducible by cytokines and growth factors
(cox-2) (hla and nielson, 1992; jones et al., 1993; kennedy et
al., 1993; kujubu et al., 1991; xie et al., 1991). this inducible
cox-2 is linked to inflammatory cell types and tissues, and is
believed to be the target enzyme for the anti-inflammatory
activity of the nsaids (fu et al., 1990; masferrer et al., 1992,
1994; raz et al., 1988; sano et al., 1992; seboldt et al., 1990).
nsaids currently available for clinical use inhibit both cox-i
and cox-2 (meade et al., 1933; o'neill et al., 1994). this
suggests that clinically useful nsaids inhibit pro-inflammatory
pgs derived from the activity of cox-2, as well as pgs in tissues

chased from sigma (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.); all other reagents
were purchased from fisher scientific. ns-398 [n-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulphonamide] was provided by
dr. john talley, and dup697 [5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4methylsulphonylphenyl)-thiophen] was provided by dr. len lee,
both of monsanto corporate research, st. louis.

cdna cloning and expression
cdna libraries were constructed from interleukin-1,/+cycloheximide-treated human dermal fibroblast cells (hdf) for  xxxg1884xxx , and from  xxxd3417xxx -differentiated hl-60 cells for  xxxg1883xxx 
(honda et al., 1990; raz et al., 1988). briefly, hdf cells were
stimulated for 2 h with interleukin 1/ (1 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 ,um) to induce the expression of  xxxg1884xxx  mrna.
human hl-60 cells (a.t.c.c.) were cultured in the presence of
i 4am  xxxd3417xxx  + 5 % (v/v) fetal-calf serum in rpmi medium
for 3 days to induce hcox- 1 mrna. first-strand cdna for
either hcox- i or  xxxg1884xxx  was synthesized from 5 ,tg of poly(a)+
rna by using superscript ii, followed by second-strand synthesis using dna polymerase i and rnaase h. the ends of the
double-stranded cdna were flushed with t-4 dna polymerase,
and excess nucleotides were separated by using a promega magic
dna prep. ecori adaptors were ligated to the cdna and
treated with t-4 kinase before electrophoresis through a lowmelting 0.80% (w/v)-agarose gel. cdna greater than 2 kb in
length was eluted from the gel with gene clean (bio 101) and
ligated into lambda-zap. the ligation reaction was packaged in
vitro and used to infect xl-1 blue cells.
approx. 150000 recombinant plaques were screened by using
hcox-l or -2 cdna probes (kindly provided by dr. t. hla,
american red cross, bethesda, md, u.s.a.). positive clones
were rescued into pbluescript vector by using x assist helper
phage and solr cells. cdna clones encoding hcox-1 and -2
were characterized by restriction analysis, and completely
sequenced by dideoxy chain-termination using sequenase.
sequencing reactions were analysed by using a dupont genesis
2000 dna analysis system. cox cdna fragments that contained only the coding sequence of each gene, with all 5' and 3'
untranslated sequences being deleted, were cloned into baculovirus transfer vector pvl1393 for expression in insect cells.

large-scale propagation of insect cells
a 10-litre biostat es fermenter (b. braun biotech; allentown,
pa, u.s.a.) was used for the large-scale propagation of cultured
sf21 insect cells. these cells were derived from the ovarian tissue
of the fall armyworm spodoptera frugiperda (vaughn et al.,
1977). the fermenter was configured for insect-cell culture by
installation of a marine impeller and oxygen enrichment. two
1.0-litre spinner cultures of sf21 cells growing in itf medium
(ipl-41 supplemented with 100% fetal-bovine serum, tryptose
phosphate broth and 0.3 % pluronic f-68) were used to inoculate
the fermenter at an initial cell density of 2.5 x 105 cells/ml. before
infection, the cells were maintained at 27 °c, agitated at
200 rev/min, sparged with 30 %-02-enriched air at a flow rate of
100 ml/min with 2 lb/in2 (13.8 kpa) fermenter back-pressure.
when the cell density reached 5 x 105 cells/ml, the 10-litre culture
was infected with virus stock at a multiplicity of infection = 0.1.
maintained above 50 % of atmospheric 02 by
dissolved 02
increasing 02 enrichment and by increasing sparger airflow rates.
cells were harvested 72 h after infection at a final cell density of
(0.8-1.2) x 106 cells/ml. the cells were isolated by centrifugation

at 4000 g for 15 minutes. final cell paste (40-60 g wet cell wt./
10 litres) was stored at -80 °c before purification.

cox purification from infected insect cells
cells (40-60 g wet wt.) were thawed and suspended in 10 vol./wet
wt. 25 mm tris/hcl (ph 8.1)/0.25 m sucrose. the pellet was
collected by centrifugation at 10000 g for 20 min and resuspended
in the same buffer. chaps was added to 1 % (w/v), from a 10 %
stock solution, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 4 'c. the
supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 50000 g for
20 min and passed through a 3 ,um-pore filter. the supernatant
was loaded directly on to a 50 ml anion-exchange column

(macro-prep high q; bio-rad, richmond, ca, u.s.a.),
equilibrated with 25 mm tris/hcl (ph 8.1)/0.4 % chaps.
cox was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing salt concentration to 0.3 m. fractions were assayed for peroxidase activity
and pooled. the pool was concentrated 10-fold with a stirred cell
(amicon) ym-30 membrane. a 10 ml portion of the conceptrate
was loaded on a 500 ml (2.6 cm x 94 cm) sephacryl s-200
(pharmacia lkb) size-exclusion column, equilibrated with
25 mm tris/hci (ph 8.1)/ 150 mm naci/0.40% chaps.
fractions were assayed for peroxidase activity and pooled.
molecular masses were determined by measuring elution volume
versus the log of the molecular mass of the following standards:
aprotinin (6.5 kda),  xxxg569xxx  (12.4 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29 kda), bsa (67 kda), a-amylase (200 kda) and
 xxxg818xxx  (443 kda). for  xxxg1883xxx , the size-exclusion-column
pool was diluted 4-fold with 25 mm tris/hcl/0.40% chaps,
and the anion-exchange-column chromatography was repeated
on an 8 ml mono-q column (pharmacia) with the same conditions described above. pools were divided into portions and
stored at -80 'c for further use.

characterization methods
separation of the samples by sds/page was performed by the
method of laemmli (1970), using an 8 cm x 1o cm 10-200%
gradient gel and stained with pro-blue (iss, hyde park, ma,
u.s.a.). a 2 ,ug portion of each sample was loaded after boiling
in reducing sample buffer. molecular-mass standards were from
sigma and used at 4 ,ug per band. total protein concentration
was determined by the method of bradford (1976) with bsa as a
standard. n-terminal sequencing was performed on an applied
biosystems (foster city, ca, u.s.a.) model 470 a gas-phase
sequencer, with respective amino acid phenylthiohydantoins
derivatives being identified by reversed-phase h.p.l.c. amino
acids composition was determined with a beckman model 6300
ninhydrin-based system, after 6 m hci vapour-phase hydrolysis.

enzyme assays
cox enzyme assay in vitro
expression of cox protein in insect cells was determined by
assessing pg-synthetic capability in homogenates from cells
incubated for 3 days with  xxxg1883xxx  or cox-2 baculovirus. cells
expressing  xxxg1883xxx  or cox-2 were homogenized as previously
described (needleman et al., 1977) and incubated with
 xxxd208xxx  (10 ,um). cox activity was determined by
monitoring pg production. no cox activity was detected in
mock-infected sf9 cells. commercial nsaids, ns-398 or
dup697 (0.001-100,um), were preincubated with crude 1 %
chaps homogenates (2-10 ,tg of protein) for 10 min before
addition of  xxxd208xxx . pge2 formed was detected by
e.l.i.s.a. (caymen), after a 10 min incubation.

purification was monitored by using a peroxidase assay adapted
to a 96-well plate format, using conditions previously described
(kulmacz and lands, 1987), which can be summarized as follows:
0.1 m tris/hci ph 8.1, 100 ,m  xxxd208xxx , 170 jum
tmpd, 1 /m haem (bovine haemin chloride in dimethyl sulphoxide), 0-2 ,ug of purified enzyme. the a590 was measured after
5 min at room temperature. one unit is defined as the amount of

results
cloning and expression of hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx 
poly(a)+ rna was isolated from hdf cells grown for 2 h in the
presence of interleukin-l,8 and cycloheximide for construction of
a cdna library as a source of a  xxxg1884xxx  cdna. a second
cdna library was synthesized from poly(a)+ rna from retinoic
acid-differentiated hl-60 cells to obtain a cdna for hcox-1.
both libraries were constructed from 5 ,ug of poly(a)+ rna, and
contained approx. 300000 recombinant plaques: 150000 plaques
were screened from the hl-60 and hdf libraries for hcox-1
and  xxxg1884xxx  respectively.
screening of the hl-60 library resulted in the identification of
six plaques that hybridized positively to the hcox-1 cdna
probe. two of the six plaques remained positive through subsequent rounds of hybridization. one of the positive clones
(pmon 23950) contained a cdna insert of 2600 bp, and
sequence analysis confirmed the identity as the homologue of the
published human  xxxg1883xxx  (yokoyama and tanabe, 1989). the
cdna includes 31 bp of 5' untranslated sequence, an open
reading frame coding for 599 amino acids, and 750 bp of 3'
untranslated sequence, including the polyadenylation signal
aataaa. the peptide sequence differs from the published
sequence at only one position, a proline at residue 17 instead of

of hcox-1.
screening of the hdf cdna library with a  xxxg1884xxx  cdna
probe (150000 plaques) resulted in 330 positive clones. of these,
12 clones were chosen at random and carried through two
additional rounds of screening; 11 cdna clones remained
positive by virtue of hybridization. two clones with insert sizes
of 1.9 kb and 2.1 kb were mapped by restriction analysis and
shown to be overlapping  xxxg1884xxx  cdnas. the longer clone
contained 97 bp of 5' untranslated sequence, as well as the
entire coding sequence followed by several hundred bases of 3'
untranslated sequence. the shorter clone isolated was a truncated
cdna that contains the 3' end of the coding sequence, and the
entire 3' untranslated sequence, including a poly(a) tail. the
complete nucleotide sequence contains 3371 bp. the deduced

purificatioit and characterization of hcox-1 and bcox-2
the purification of human cox-2 is summarized in table 1.
cells from 10 litres of fermentation yielded 46 g wet wt. of cells,
which after extraction with chaps yielded 1001 mg of total
protein. anion-exchange chromatography produced an 1 1-fold
purification. and 64-% yield. the chromatogram indicates multiple forms of the enzyme, with three or more major peaks being
eluted between 100 and 150 mm nacl (figure la); the major
peak of peroxidase activity was pooled and concentrated. sizeexclusion chromatography provided an additional 1.45-fold
purification with a 72 % step yield. the elution volume from the
size-exclusion column indicates a molecular mass of approx.
150 kda, which is the molecular mass of dimer cox (figure lb).
this process yielded 29 mg of purified protein with a 16-fold
purification and total yield of 46 %. the protein was shown to be
> 90 % pure by reducing sds/page, with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kda (figure 2a). n-terminal sequencing
produced

a

major signal

of

anpccshpcq ...... which is the

correctly processed form beginning at residue 18 of the coding
sequence. quantification of total protein by the bradford (1976)
method was within 1 % of that obtained from the amino acid
composition. purified cox-2 has a specific activity in the 02
assay of 12.2 /tmol of o2/min per mg of protein (figure 3b), with
a km for  xxxd208xxx  of 8.7 ,um and a vmax of 1088 nmol of
02/nmol of protein.
the purification of  xxxg1883xxx  is summarized in table 2. a 10-1
fermentation yielded 66 g wet wt. of cells, from which 2.3 mg of
purified cox was produced with an overall yield of 75 % and a
246-fold purification. the protein was shown to be > 80 % pure

by sds/page, with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kda
(figure 2b). n-terminal sequencing revealed a major signal of
axpgaptpvn

which is the

correctly processed form of

the enzyme beginning at residue 25 of the coding sequence. the
 xxxd233xxx  at the second position in the coding sequence could
not be seen, due to a buffer artifact. quantification of total
protein by the bradford (1976) method was within 1 % of that
obtained by amino acid composition. purified  xxxg1883xxx  has a
specific activity in the 02 assay of 18.8 ,tmol of 02/min per mg
of protein, with a km for  xxxd208xxx  of 13.8 ,m and a vknx. of
1519 nmol of 02/nmol of protein (figure 3a).

pharmacological manipulation of hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx 
when either hcox-l or  xxxg1884xxx  was incubated with arachidonic
acid and then assayed for pge2 production, it was found that
indomethacin inhibited both forms of the enzyme, with an ic50
of approx. 100 nm for hcox- i and 900 nm for  xxxg1884xxx  (table

3). likewise, several commercially available nsaids were
examined, and inhibited both hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx  in vitro.
these results differed significantly from the inhibitory profile of
either ns-398 or dup-697, which both demonstrated selectivity
for the  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme (ic50 0.1 and 0.01 ,um respectively)
versus the hcox-1 enzyme (> 100 and 0.8,um respectively)
(table 3). the selectivity of ns-398 and dup-697 for the  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme was confirmed when cox activity was measured
directly by 02 consumption (figure 4). with 200 nm of the
purified enzyme preparation in the presence of 100,um  xxxd208xxx , both ns-398 and dup-697 inhibited  xxxg1884xxx  (ic50
1.6 and 0.2 pm respectively) with greater potency compared with
hcox- i (ic50 > 250 and 4.5 pm respectively), whereas indomethacin inhibited both forms of the enzyme (ic50: cox-i,
1 pm; cox-2, 10 pm). as previously reported, indomethacin
showed some selectivity for inhibition of hcox- versus hcox2 (meade et al., 1993; o'neill et al., 1994).

figure 4 dose/response curves for inhibition by indomethacin and selective
cox-2 inhibitors of  xxxg1883xxx  (a) and  xxxg1884xxx  (b)
indomethacin (a), ns-398 (a) and dup-697 (0) (1.0-250 j/m) were incubated with
200 nm enzyme for 1 min before addition of 100 #um  xxxd208xxx . 02 uptake activity was
then measured.

inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  by indomethacin, ns-398 or dup-697
increased with time after preincubation of the enzyme with
inhibitor before addition of  xxxd208xxx , as measured by the
02-consumption assay (figure 5). we found that 166 ,um indomethacin, 1 ,#m ns-398 and 0.1 am dup-697 inhibited  xxxg1884xxx 
activity by 20-30 % at 5 s and by 70(80 % after 1 min.
 xxxd2556xxx  acid at 5 ,um showed no such time-dependence, with

the critical step in the formation of pro-inflammatory pgs is the
oxygenation of  xxxd208xxx  by cox enzyme. recently two
forms of cox enzyme have been identified:  xxxg1883xxx , which is
constitutively expressed in many tissues, and cox-2, which is
associated with pro-inflammatory pg production in several
tissues and cell types. analysis of mrna from normal tissues in
the rodent indicate that  xxxg1883xxx  mrna is found in nearly every
tissue examined, including stomach, kidney, heart, brain, liver
and spleen, whereas cox-2 mrna was nearly undetectable in
these normal tissues (seibert et al., 1994). conversely, in models
of inflammation (e.g. carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema and
granuloma pouch) oedema is produced that correlates with a
significant induction of cox-2 mrna and protein (masferrer et
al., 1992; seibert et al., 1994). the identification of an inducible
form of the cox enzyme led us to the hypothesis that selective
inhibition of cox-2 would be anti-inflammatory without the
gastric toxicity associated with nsaids that are at present
available clinically. indeed, we have recently reported that ns398 selectively inhibits murine cox-2 enzyme activity, and that

it is anti-inflammatory in vivo without gastric toxicity (masferrer
et al., 1994).
insect-cell expression of the human  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 clones
provided a rich source of active enzyme for purification and for
pharmacological evaluation of potentially selective compounds.
initial experiments to determine extraction conditions indicated
that chaps was at least as good as tween-20 and nonidet
p-40 and superior to octyl glucoside. chaps was chosen because
it is easily dialysable and exchanged with other detergents.
western-blot analysis of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 extracts indicates a
significant portion of immunoreactive protein not extracted
(results not shown). cox-2 was extracted approx. 10-fold more
efficiently than cox- 1, as borne out by assays of cell extracts,
western-blot analysis and purification yields. the reason for this
difference is unclear, although one explanation lies in the
difference in the signal sequence of cox-2 from that of  xxxg1883xxx ,
which might affect insertion into the membrane. purified recombinant cox-i has approximately the same specific activity
as reported for ram seminal vesicle  xxxg1883xxx  (smith and marnett,
1991). as with the purified sheep seminal-vesicle cox-i enzyme,
addition of haem was necessary for activity, with 02 uptake
increased 20-fold by addition of 1 ,um haem.
none of the commercially available nsaids tested demonstrated any significant selectivity for cox-2; indomethacin
actually appeared somewhat more potent in its ability to inhibit
human  xxxg1883xxx  that human cox-2, in agreement with similar
observations using murine recombinant enzyme (meade et al.
1993). we report that both ns-398 and dup-697 selectively
inhibit human cox-2, with significantly less ability to inhibit
 xxxg1883xxx . this is consistent with their reported anti-inflammatory
activity in rats without gastric toxicity (futaki et al., 1993a,b;
gans et al., 1989). mechanistically, the commercially available
nsaids fall into two categories: those that inhibit  xxxg1883xxx 
reversibly (e.g.  xxxd2556xxx  acid) and those that demonstrate an
irreversible time-dependent inhibition of activity in vitro (e.g.
indomethacin) (kulmacz and lands, 1985; rome and lands,
1975). this study demonstrates that indomethacin, in addition to
the two cox-2-selective compounds (ns-398 and dup-697),
also inhibit cox-2 in an irreversible time-dependent manner,
whereas the reversible inhibitor  xxxd2556xxx  acid does not. recently the three-dimensional structure for  xxxg1883xxx  was solved
(picot et al., 1994); availability of the crystal structure for  xxxg1884xxx  along with selective inhibitors should allow for greater understanding of the interaction of inhibitors with the active site and
their mechanism of inhibition.
the potential clinical advantage of a selective cox-2 inhibitor
is unquestioned. current nsaid therapy, albeit anti-inflammatory, is often limited in its usefulness due to mechanism-based
toxicities of these drugs, especially gastrointestinal lesions
resulting from inhibition of stomach and intestinal pg formation
(allison et al., 1992). development of a selective cox-2 inhibitor
may represent a major advance in the treatment of patients with
acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. availability of purified  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 enzyme will allow further mechanistic
and pharmacological evaluation of these closely related enzymes,
positively influencing the development of additional safe and
effective cox-2 inhibitors.
we thank rodney combs for providing insect-cell fermentations, christine smith for
determining n-terminal sequence, and jim zobel for determining amino acid
composition.
