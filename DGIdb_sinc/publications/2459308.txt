modulation of the benzodiazepine/gamma- xxxd2177xxx  receptor chloride channel complex by inhalation anesthetics.  inhalation anesthetics, such as  xxxd2052xxx , halothane, and  xxxd1993xxx , increase 36cl- uptake into rat cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes in a concentration-dependent,  xxxd2947xxx -sensitive fashion. at concentrations consistent with those that stimulate 36cl- uptake, inhalation anesthetics also inhibit the binding of t-[35s]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35s]tbps) to well-washed cortical membranes. scatchard analysis of [35s]tbps binding indicates that these agents reduce the apparent affinity of this radioligand and have little effect on the bmax. the ability of inhalation anesthetics to directly stimulate 36cl- uptake and inhibit [35s]tbps binding is a property shared by nonvolatile anesthetics. nonetheless, there are differences between nonvolatile agents (such as barbiturates and alcohols) and inhalation anesthetics, because the former compounds augment muscimol (a gabamimetic) stimulated 36cl- uptake, whereas the latter group (such as ether and  xxxd1993xxx ) inhibit this effect. these findings demonstrate that therapeutically relevant concentrations of inhalation anesthetics perturb the benzodiazepine/gamma- xxxd2177xxx  receptor chloride channel complex, and suggest this oligomeric protein may be a common mediator of some aspects of anesthetic action.
