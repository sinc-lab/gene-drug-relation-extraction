abstract
standard unfractionated heparin (ufh) has been in clinical use for over 50 years. the
commercial use of low molecular weight heparins (lmwhs) began in the mid 1980s for
hemodialysis and the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (dvt). initially, the clinical
development of lmwhs was concentrated on the european continent. subsequently,
lmwhs were introduced in north america as well. in the initial stages of development of
these drugs only  xxxd2690xxx ,  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin were used. subsequently, several
other lmwhs such as  xxxd214xxx ,  xxxd3379xxx , reviparin and parnaparin were introduced.
lmwhs constitute a group of important medications with total sales reaching nearly 2.5
billion dollars with expanded indications reaching far beyond the initial indications for the
prophylaxis of post-surgical dvt. this review highlights the pharmacology of  xxxd3379xxx .
unlike other lmwhs,  xxxd3379xxx  is prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis with heparinase,
while various chemical depolymerization methods are used for the synthesis of other
lmwhs. as compared with the standard heparin, lmwhs have different pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties; they also differ in clinical benefits.

introduction
in recent years, clinical studies have clarified the potential and shortcomings of anticoagulant therapy in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. the discovery and introduction of heparin derivatives, such as lmwhs, have enhanced the
clinical options for the management of thromboembolic disorders while enhancing the
safety of therapy. in the united states lmwhs are currently approved for the prophylaxis

and treatment of dvt. other indications for lmwhs, including unstable angina, non-q
wave myocardial infarction, and many others are under evaluation. as polypharmacological agents these drugs are expected to be useful in several other clinical indications, such
as inflammatory diseases and cancer. additional pharmacological studies and well-designed clinical trials evaluate various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
of lmwhs. these trials are likely to expand the clinical profile of each individual drug of
this class. the key reason behind the success of heparin in thrombosis and beyond is its
multiple sites of action that contribute to the prevention and treatment of multifactorial
diseases. these diseases can benefit only slightly by a drug that has only one mechanism
of action. thromboembolic disorders are driven by hypercoagulable, hyperactive platelets, pro-inflammatory endothelial dysfunction, and pro-angiogenesis states. heparin can
effectively modulate these multifactorial components as well as the interface between
them.
despite extensive research and development efforts in newer anticoagulants, ufh and
lmwhs will continue to play a pivotal role in the management of thrombotic disorders.
while heparin-induced thrombocytopenia represents the major side effect of this drug,
heparin has remained the anticoagulant of choice for the prophylaxis and treatment of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders, surgical anticoagulation and interventional usage.
elucidation of the structure of heparin led to the development of lmwhs, synthetic heparinomimetics, antithrombin and anti- xxxg741xxx  agents (1,15,48,61).
even though heparin was discovered over a half of a century ago, our knowledge of the
chemical structure and molecular interactions of this fascinating substance was limited
during the early stages of its development. through the efforts of major multidisciplinary
groups of researchers and clinicians, it is now well recognized that heparin has multiple
sites of actions and can be used in multiple indications. in the near future we are likely to
witness the impact of these drugs on the management of various diseases beyond thromboembolic disorders.
one represantative of lmwh class is  xxxd3379xxx , that is produced by controlled
enzymatic depolymerization (fig. 1) of conventional porcine heparin (15,39).  xxxd3379xxx 
is a potent anticoagulant (44). it is more effective than unfractionated heparin in the
treatment of dvt and is effective in the treatment of pulmonary embolism and the prevention of dvt in abdominal surgery patients. it is superior to warfarin in the prophylaxis
of thromboembolism in subjects undergoing orthopedic joint (hip or knee) replacement

surgery (28,29,36,57). it is also an effective anticoagulant for extracorporeal circuits in
hemodialysis (55).  xxxd3379xxx  has been marketed for over 10 years in europe, over 6 years
in canada, and was recently approved by the food and drug administration (fda) in the
usa. worldwide it is marketed under the tradename  xxxd3379xxx ® (leo pharmaceutical
products). in countries other than usa it is approved for the treatment of dvt, pulmonary
embolism (pe), prevention of dvt following hip or knee replacement surgery, prevention
of dvt following general surgery, and for anticoagulation of extracorporeal circuits
during hemodialysis.
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity has served as the primary biomarker for assessing the exposure
to  xxxd3379xxx  and other low molecular weight heparins. it is used to define the in vitro potency and to monitor therapeutic response (54). given that lmwhs are polycomponent
moieties with multiple biological actions, each with a distinct time course, the true pharmacokinetic behavior of these agents cannot be assessed with assays developed for a
single pharmacological activity. the absolute bioavailability, based on anti- xxxg741xxx  activity is ~90% (40,54). on the basis of plasma levels of  xxxg2266xxx 
( xxxg2266xxx ) it is ~93% (45).  xxxg2266xxx , a vascular endothelial biomarker might be of importance in
the elucidation of the role of lmwhs in various diseases (33,46).
in recent clinical trials lmwhs with different anti- xxxg741xxx  to anti-factor iia ratios
were tested in dvt patients following hip replacement. lmwhs did not differ in either
efficacy or safety when compared to ufh, although there were distinct differences in activity profiles of biomarkers. anti- xxxg741xxx  activity is a sensitive indicator of molecular
weights of different heparin fractions (12). lmwhs vary in their affinity for antithrombin
iii (at iii), presumably due to differences in the methods of their production (8). the differences in the pharmacodynamics of lmwhs (as assessed by anti- xxxg741xxx  activity)
have been also attributed to the same cause. because of these differences lmwhs cannot
be used interchangeably.

key factors in thrombosis
intravascular thrombosis is one of the most frequent pathologic events and a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in western civilization. factors that stimulate thrombosis
include vascular damage, stimulation of platelets, and activation of coagulation cascade.
platelet adhesion to exposed sub-endothelial surfaces of injured vessels with subsequent
activation and the resulting aggregation and activation of coagulation system has been
shown to be associated with various vascular pathological conditions.
dvt and pe are complications in orthopedic surgery, cancer, and cardiac diseases.
based on surveys in tecumseh, michigan, and worcester, massachusetts, the estimated incidence of new dvt cases is approximately 100 per 100,000 patients/year. this translates
into about 250,000 to 300,000 new cases per year in the united states (2,9,10). thrombosis is also responsible for most acute manifestations of coronary artery disease. arterial
thrombosis accounts for over 60% of all major morbidity and mortality in industrialized
countries (43).

role of platelets in thrombosis
several lines of evidence demonstrated the interplay between activated platelets and
vascular endothelium (43). hyperactive platelets provide a surface for thrombin generation, a potent platelet activator. additionally, activated platelets interact with leukocytes
leading to platelet-leukocyte cohesion and leukocyte activation.

role of coagulation in thrombosis
at the top of the coagulation activation cascade is the  xxxg748xxx  viia. at the center,
or the cross between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, is  xxxg741xxx  while at the end of
the cascade is the key mediator of fibrin generation factor iia (thrombin). heparin and
lmwhs modulate multiple sites in the coagulation cascade (xa, iia, ixa, xiia, and viia)
via the binding to the cofactor  xxxg2056xxx  (61).

role of inflammation in thrombosis
various proinflammatory stimuli could be a major predisposing factor in the propagation of thromboembolic disorders. endotoxin, which can be liberated from e. coli and
other bacteria, can induce proinflammatory states with an increase of tissue necrosis factor
alpha (tnfá) and other cytokines. that would lead to the activation of leukocytes with the
increased expression of membrane l-selectin, and the shedding of soluble l-selectin,
which can serve as a surrogate marker of leukocyte activation (62). activation of leukocytes leads to the propagation and generation of tissue factors, which initiate and amplify
a hypercoaguable state. a hypercoagulable state generates thrombin and activates the platelets leading to the overexpression of platelet membrane  xxxg2049xxx . it also leads to the
shedding of soluble  xxxg2049xxx , which can act as a potential surrogate marker of platelet activation. additionally, the proinflammatory state can induce endothelial cell (ec) insult
leading to increased ec membrane expression and shedding of soluble vascular adhesion
molecules-1 ( xxxg2406xxx ), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) and  xxxg2048xxx .

role of endothelium in thrombosis
normal endothelium has various antithrombotic and antiinflammatory mediators for
the autoregulation of endothelial cell function and vascular protection. however, upon
vascular injury different prothrombotic and proinflammatory mediators are triggered, with
a shift in the balance from the antithrombotic and antiinflammatory state to a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state.

pharmacology of heparin and lmwhs
ufh is highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycan that binds freely and nonspecifically to various proteins, and effectively binds to at iii. since plasma protein levels of

lmwhs

203

at iii are variable, constant monitoring of the ufh dose is required. ufh is currently indicated for the prevention of dvt in low-risk patients (<40 years of age, undergoing uncomplicated surgery, and without any risk for thromboembolism). it is also indicated in
high risk patients (>40 years of age, undergoing major abdominal and/or thoracic surgery)
for prevention of thromboembolic diseases. the dose of ufh should be monitored to keep
the activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) at 1.5 to provide adequate prophylaxis.
under these circumstances, an increased risk for postoperative bleeding accompanies the
use of ufh (27,38). ufh (by continous i.v. infusion) is also indicated for the treatment of
dvt in combination with warfarin (starting on day 1 or day 2 after the event, for 3
months). additional indications for ufh include treatment of acute pulmonary embolism,
unstable angina, embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and acute peripheral arterial
occlusion (7,11,18,20,30,51).
long-term ufh administration has been shown to increase osteoclastic activity and
bone resorption. this effect may be related to the dosage rather than duration of exposure
to ufh (38,41). hypersensitivity to ufh preparations may cause necrosis of skin overlying the injection site. necrosis is believed to be the result of the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, with or without deposition of platelets. ufh injections have also been
associated with metabolic changes, such as a marked increase in both lipolytic activity and
in plasma levels of free  xxxd2154xxx . such increases may cause complications in patients
with type ii hyperlipidemia.
lmwhs have a lower reactivity to platelets, which correlates inversely with the anticoagulant activity in normal platelet-rich plasma (table 1). however, lmwh fractions with
either low or high antithrombotic activity react equally with platelets in platelet-rich
plasma depleted of at iii. this suggests formation of heparin-at iii complexes that
protect platelets from aggregation (35). lmwhs are less affected than ufh by platelet
factor 4 ( xxxg1726xxx ), a protein that effectively neutralizes heparin molecules (17,53).
in contrast to ufh, lmwhs have a lower affinity for binding to plasma proteins and
platelets. this difference in binding profile explains the pharmacokinetic differences observed with lmwhs and ufh (table 1). the binding of ufh to plasma proteins reduces
its anticoagulant activity, which, combined with the variations in plasma concentrations of
heparin-binding proteins, is reflected in its unpredictable anticoagulant response.
lmwhs’ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (table 1) are determined by a
number of their biological properties. these include improved subcutaneous bioavailabil-

ity, lower protein binding, longer half-life, variable number of at iii binding sites, and
variable glycosaminoglycan contents. these properties also include variable anti-serine
protease activities (anti-xa, anti-iia, anti-xa/anti-iia ratio, and inhibition of other coagulation factors), variable potency in releasing  xxxg2266xxx , and variable levels of vascular endothelial cell binding kinetics (8,12,46). for these reasons, over the last decade lmwhs
have increasingly replaced ufh in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders (vte). randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that individual
lmwhs used at optimized dosages are as effective and safer than ufh (25,27–29). the
convenient (once or twice daily s.c.) dosing regimen, without the need for monitoring, encouraged the wide use of lmwhs. it is well established that different lmwhs vary in
their physical and chemical properties due to the differences in the manufacturing
methods. these differences translate into differences in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics (8). the world health organization (who) and fda regard
lmwhs as individual drugs that cannot be used interchangeably (8,13).
bioavailability of lmwhs after i.v. or s.c. administration is higher than for ufh; it
was estmated as 90 to 95% (6). in contrast, ufh, s.c., has a bioavailability of 15 to 25%.
lmwhs have biological half-life (based on anti-xa clearance) nearly double that of ufh.
the t1/2 of lmwhs: enoxaparin, deltaparin,  xxxd3379xxx , and others has been reported to be
~100 and 360 min, i.v. or s.c., respectively. the anti-xa activity persists longer than antithrombin activity, which reflects the faster clearance of longer heparin chains (6).
at doses based on patient weight, lmwhs do not require monitoring. this is likely
due to the better bioavailability, longer plasma t1/2, and more predictable anticoagulant response to lmwhs as compared to ufh, s.c. although lmwhs are more expensive than
ufh, a pilot study in pediatric patients found that lmwhs require less laboratory assays,
nursing hours, and phlebotomy time (58).
lmwhs are expected to continue to erode the use of ufh through development of
new indications and an increased comfort of physicians with them. in addition, as both
patients and health care providers recognize, the relative simplicity of s.c. administration,
together with pharmacoeconomic advantage (cost savings) and quality-of-life benefits
(reduction of hospitalization), the trend for greater use of lmwhs in outpatients will
continue.

differentiation of lmwhs:
structure-function differences
the variations in molecular composition and pharmacological properties of lmwhs
are reflected in differences in their clinical efficacy and safety. each lmwh should,
therefore, be considered as a unique substance. the main differences between lmwhs
are variations in the amount of pharmacologically active component, varying chemical
and physical compositions resulting in different biologic actions, and clinical differences
in trials performed at the optimized doses for each agent.
lmwhs have different physiochemical characteristics as a result of the diverse
methods of their manufacturing. these chracteristics make them non-interchangeable.
anticoagulant potency of heparin is expressed in usp u/mg. this expression of potency

is applicable to lmwhs only at high doses, when their anticoagulant properties are apparent. anti-xa activity has not enabled standardization of the biologic actions of
lmwhs, since it does not address the at iii–independent actions of lmwhs. the
european pharmacopoeia commission has nevertheless adopted anti-xa activity as a
measure of lmwhs potency. since other markers of pharmacological activity also differ
among lwmhs, their anti-iia activity may prove useful in determining the biologic activity of each lmwh.

methods of manufacturing
all of the commercially available lmwhs are manufactured by depolymerization of
porcine mucosal heparin preparations (15,39,40,54). bovine heparins are not used in their
production because of the possible viral contamination. lmwhs are either prepared by
chemical or enzymatic digestion methods. most lmwhs exhibit approximately one third
of the molecular weight of regular heparin. initially, the clinical batches of lmwhs were
prepared by ethanolic fractionation of heparin. however, due to the cost and limited availability of heparin for the sizeable isolation of these agents, chemical and enzymatic depolymerization procedures were developed. physical methods such as irradiation and
ultrasonification have also been employed in the preparation of these agents. all of the
currently available lmwhs are manufactured by chemical or enzymatic depolymerization of porcine mucosal heparin. controlled depolymerization processes were widely used
to produce products with similar molecular weights. however, marked differences in the
chemical composition of each of these products were inflicted during the depolymerization process.  xxxd3379xxx  is the only lmwh known that is prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis with heparinase (15,39,40,54).
although the depolymerization process results in lower molecular weight heparin
products (mw 4 to 8 kda), these products exhibit differences in both their molecular
structure and functional properties. optimized methods are currently employed to prepare
lmwhs, which exhibit a similar molecular profile. however, due to the significant differences in the chemical or enzymatic procedures, structural variations are found in all of
these agents. these differences exert significant influence on the biologic action of these
products. safety and efficacy of these agents have been only recently compared in welldesigned clinical trials. initial attempts to standardize lmwhs on the basis of their biologic actions, such as anti-xa potency, have failed. a potency designation on the basis of
the anti- xxxg741xxx  actions represents only one of the several properties of these agents.
furthermore, this assay measures only at iii affinity-based actions of some of the components of these agents. many of the pharmacological actions of lmwhs are based on components that have no affinity for at iii (35,37,44,46,52). these actions include the release
of  xxxg2266xxx  or  xxxg1766xxx , inhibition of adhesion molecules, decrease in the circulating von
willebrand factor and modulation of blood flow. most of these effects are not measurable
by using the conventional methods such as the anti- xxxg741xxx , anti-factor iia and global
anticoagulant tests.

molecular weight distribution
lmwhs have a mean molecular mass ranging from 4 to 8 kda. more than 60% of the
polysaccharides have molecular masses between 2 and 8 kda, resulting in a reduction in
thrombin-neutralizing capacity (anti-factor iia activity). the anticoagulant properties of
heparins depend on the presence of specific pentasaccharide sequences with a high affinity for at iii. the depolymerization methods result in the modification of at iii-binding sites and in reduced activity of specific lmwhs. lmwhs have different properties
and characteristics, a direct result of their method of synthesis and the resulting molecular
weight distribution (15,39,40,54).

degree of sulfation
chemical modifications of the end groups and internal structure, degree of sulfation,
and charge density vary from product to product and affect the characteristics of the end
products. depending on the method of preparation, the lmwhs are different mixtures of
various polysaccharides with different degree of sulfation. consequently, they differ in
anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activities, as well as in their effect on endothelial  xxxg2266xxx 
release (35,46) and other biological actions.

pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and elimination
 xxxd3379xxx  ( xxxd3379xxx ®,  xxxd3379xxx ®), a lmwh with an average molecular weight of
6.5 kda, is produced by depolymerization of heparin by heparinase, an enzyme isolated
from flavobacterium heparinum (17). this allows for the production of a lmwh with
intact structure and the highest level of sulfation. the bioavailability of the  xxxd3379xxx 
fraction with anti- xxxg741xxx  activity is higher than of the fraction with anti-factor iia activity. the absorption t1/2 for anti-xa is ~200 min. the difference may indicate that bioavailability is dependent on molecular weight. longer chain lengths are necessary for
anti-factor iia activity than for anti- xxxg741xxx  activity. in healthy volunteers the bioavailability of  xxxd3379xxx , based on the anti- xxxg741xxx  activity, is ~90%. based on a one-compartment model, the elimination t1/2 was calculated to be 82 min (17). the elimination t1/2
was found to be dose-dependent. the t1/2 after i.v. administration of 5000 iu anti-factor
xa was determined to be about 112 min, compared with 61 min for the same dose of ufh.
the largest accumulation of available data is a retrospective pharmacokinetic population
analysis. this analysis included 425 patients and 2631 observations and described the
anti-xa activity of s.c. administered  xxxd3379xxx  as a two-compartment model (plasmatic
and vascular) with first-order absorption kinetics. the elimination t1/2 was found to be between 200 and 310 min (mean of 230 min) with a mean clearance of 0.0176 l/h/kg.
the elimination route of ufh,  xxxd3379xxx  or other lmwhs is predominantly renal,
with about 90% of the administered dose detectable in the urine over a period of 7 days.
the majority of excreted material is recovered in the urine within the first 24 h after administration. only minimal amount of lmwhs is excreted in feces (17). the lmwh
fraction found in the urine is characterized by a slightly lower molecular mass and has no
anti-xa activity.

lmwhs

207

in addition to its presence in plasma,  xxxd3379xxx  exhibits a strong vascular distribution,
with a relatively long residence time. ufh is distributed into the plasma protein and the
free plasma pools, but has limited vascular distribution. in general, the lower is the molecular weight, the higher is the distribution in plasma and the lower is the vascular distribution. hence, there is less need for dose adjustment with  xxxd3379xxx  in contrast to ufh or
other lmwhs. the pentasaccharide has 100% plasmatic and 0% vascular distribution. if
the dose is not adjusted in renal failure patients, pentasaccharide will readily accumulate
and cause bleeding. lmwhs with relatively low molecular weights and relatively low
sulfate/carboxylate ratios will have similar effects.

anticoagulation: plasmatic vs. vascular-mediated effects
plasmatic effects at different steps in the coagulation cascade
heparin affects the coagulation cascade at multiple sites. heparin-mediated effects
could be classified as either at iii-dependent or -independent. in comparison with ufh
individual lmwhs have better bioavailability, longer half-life (t1/2), and more sustained
activity. this makes it possible to provide adequate anticoagulation for dvt prophylaxis
and treatment with once a day s.c. administration of lmwhs, such as  xxxd3379xxx  (15,31).
the anti-factor iia over anti- xxxg741xxx  ratio for ufh is ~1. by convention, the
anti- xxxg741xxx  effect of lmwhs is identical, although the anti-factor iia effect increases
with the increase in the molecular weight. differences in anti- xxxg741xxx  activities have
been demonstrated for various lmwhs (13). however, since anti-factor iia and antifactor xa activities of each lmwh do not represent the total antithrombotic or potential
bleeding effects of the respective agents, the international society on thrombosis and
haemostasis recommends that vial labeling be based on weight. labeling should also include specific anti-factor iia and anti- xxxg741xxx  activities, in accordance with the international standard, and the recommended therapeutic dose. the antithrombotic potency and
potential bleeding effects of one product cannot be extrapolated to another on the basis of
weights in milligrams or on their anti- xxxg741xxx  or anti-factor iia activities.
pharmacokinetic studies have shown that lmwhs have a relatively high
bioavailability after s.c. injection as compared to ufh. such studies have also demonstrated a longer t1/2 of their anticoagulant and anti- xxxg741xxx  activities than that of ufh.
initial reports of a high incidence of bleeding have been reevaluated. when used in the
lower, more appropriate doses for prevention of thrombosis, lmwhs have not been associated with an increased risk of perioperative bleeding. other side effects such as thrombocytopenia and skin necrosis also occur with lmwhs, but the occurrence rate appears
much lower than with ufh (16). lmwhs inhibit  xxxg741xxx  activity, thrombin (iia) activity, and cause release of  xxxg2266xxx  at different dose levels (14,44,46) and inhibit clot dynamics regardless of the stimulus (6). endotoxin is known to promote tnfá production and
 xxxg748xxx  production that leads to the initiation and propagation of clot formation and
strength (62).  xxxd3379xxx  is a potent functional inhibitor of clot formation and strength induced by different stimuli (46).

vascular effects at the endothelium
the vascular versus plasmatic effects of lmwhs are currently gaining tremendous interest in explaining the actions of lmwh in various settings. the role of  xxxg748xxx 
pathway inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx ) in the prevention of thrombosis has been initially found to be
limited. subsequent studies have challenged this view.  xxxg2266xxx  interferes with enzyme-substrate interactions resulting in a complex of four proteins:  xxxg2266xxx , tf, xa, and viia. this interaction can occur at the endothelial surface, and, therefore,  xxxg2266xxx  may be involved in the
maintenance of a non-thrombotic state of the endothelium.  xxxg2266xxx  also interacts with
several mechanisms, including generation of elastase, low-density lipoproteins, and tf
mediation of platelet and macrophage activation.  xxxg2266xxx  is released into the bloodstream
after administration of ufh or lmwhs. prophylactic lmwh administration can increase
plasma concentration of  xxxg2266xxx  (37,45,46).  xxxg2266xxx  is synergistic with heparin in clotting
assays and may contribute to the antithrombotic action of heparin (44). high cellular distribution of  xxxg2266xxx  is found in endothelial cells with only limited distribution to platelets,
monocytes or other cells.

in vitro effects of lmwh on endothelial  xxxg2266xxx 
in vitro studies of  xxxd3379xxx  demonstrated a time-dependent and saturable binding
profile in endothelial cells, with both low and high affinity binding (35). heparin has also
been shown to increase endothelial  xxxg2266xxx  release by an at iii-independent mechanism.
the release of endothelial  xxxg2266xxx  is directly dependent on the molecular weight (mw) and
the degree of sulfation. there is no release of  xxxg2266xxx  with pentasaccharide but as the mw
increases above 2000 to 3000 and up to 8000 da, there is a significant increase in  xxxg2266xxx  release (46). additionally, the degree of sulfation contributes significantly to the endothelial
 xxxg2266xxx  release (46) at the same mw. different lmwhs demonstrated different capacity in
releasing endothelial  xxxg2266xxx .

in vivo effects of lmwh on plasma  xxxg2266xxx 
at the dose recommended for the treatment of dvt (175 iu/kg s.c.)  xxxd3379xxx  was reported to produce a five-fold increase in plasma levels of  xxxg2266xxx  in human healthy volunteers (45). at the prophylactic dose (75 iu/kg s.c.)  xxxd3379xxx  produced a three-fold increase in the plasma levels of  xxxg2266xxx . the released  xxxg2266xxx  has potent anticoagulant properties
by itself in inhibiting platelet/fibrin clot formation, strength and dynamics. a synergistic
interaction was found between  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxg2266xxx  in clotting assays. the combination of
a lwmh and  xxxg2266xxx  is far more potent in clotting assays than either substance alone (52).
another non-at iii mediated action of lmwhs is the promotion of fibrinolysis (17).
 xxxd3379xxx  was shown to affect fibrinolysis. in prophylactic use for dvt  xxxd3379xxx  increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ) and fibrin and fibrinogen degradation
products.  xxxd3379xxx  also enhances á2-antiplasmin activity. levels of  xxxg1766xxx  antigen were
significantly elevated in patients undergoing total hip replacement who were receiving
 xxxd3379xxx  for up to 7 days as a dvt prophylaxis.

lmwhs

209

clinical experience
efficacy and safety comparisons of lmwhs vs. ufh demonstrated that lmwhs were
at least as effective as ufh in reducing mortality rates after acute dvt (28,57). lmwhs
were also shown to be as safe as ufh with respect to major bleeding complications and as
effective as ufh in preventing thromboembolic recurrences. the use of lmwhs has
been associated with a lower incidence of major bleeding and a lower mortality rate, particularly in patients with cancer (28). trials with fixed s.c. doses of lmwhs, adjusted for
body weight, and no monitoring, showed that lmwhs are safer and more effective than
ufh at adjusted doses (28).
in a double-blind randomized trial involving 432 patients with proximal vein thrombosis the effects of  xxxd3379xxx  were compared with those of adjusted-dose continuous i.v.
heparin. the objective documentation was used for evaluation of clinical outcome.  xxxd3535xxx  was administered on day 2 of therapy and continued for 3 months. the incidence of new thromboembolism was higher in the ufh than in  xxxd3379xxx -treated patients
(p < 0.7). risk for major bleeding was reduced by 95% in the  xxxd3379xxx  treated patients
(p < 0.06). risk reduction for death was 51% in favor of the lmwh regimen (p = 0.49).
the risk reduction was particularly striking in patients with cancer. in patients with metastatic carcinoma the long-term use of  xxxd3379xxx  appeared to have a better effect than ufh
on mortality, bleeding, and recurrent thromboembolism (29,31).
the goals in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (pe) is to prevent further extension
of a thrombus and to accelerate fibrinolysis. anticoagulants are used in this clinical setting
but have to be administered for extended periods of time after the embolic event. heparin
acts by inhibiting thrombin and  xxxg741xxx  through at iii. lmwhs s.c. have been shown
to be as safe and effective as ufh, and their once-daily fixed dose raises the possibility of
treating selected patients at home. however, data on the use of lmwhs in the treatment
of acute pe are limited. a study by simonneau et al. (57) compared fixed-dose  xxxd3379xxx 
with adjusted-dose ufh in 612 patients with symptomatic pe who did not require thrombolytic therapy or embolectomy.  xxxd3379xxx  was administered s.c., once daily, ufh by a
continuous i.v. infusion. oral anticoagulant therapy was started between day 1 and day 3
and continued for at least 3 months. the treatment effect of the two regimens was compared at day 8 and day 9 using combined endpoint for recurrent thromboembolism,
bleeding, and death. no statistically significant differences were observed between the
two groups. there was no excess bleeding in the  xxxd3379xxx  group (2.0% of patients vs.
2.6% of patients on ufh). it was concluded that in patients with acute pe the initial s.c.
therapy with  xxxd3379xxx  is as safe and effective as that with ufh. the benefits and ease of
administration of lmwhs in patients with dvt are likely to be similar in hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic pe (31).
the effects of lmwh, s.c., and ufh, i.v., were compared in patients with proximal
dvt. the clinical outcome, cost, and cost-effectiveness of both methods were evaluated
the american-canadian thrombosis study randomized 432 patients and found  xxxd3379xxx 
sodium, s.c., to be at least as effective and safe as ufh i.v., but less expensive. the costeffectiveness of the lmwh administration could have been greater if outpatient therapy
had been implemented (16). once again, the results of this study could not be extrapolated
to other lmwhs, since their molecular composition and pharmacokinetic profiles differ
and their cost may vary considerably (16).

lmwhs have an efficacy profile equivalent to, or better than, ufh. their safety
profile suggests fewer complications than with ufh. nevertheless, several side effects
have been documented. though initially believed to be absent with lmwhs, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) has been reported in a few lmwh-treated patients.
however, the frequency with which this side effect occured was far lower than with ufh.
because lmwhs are considered to be less immunogenic due to their lower molecular
weights, lmwh anticoagulation therapy may be possible in patients with hit (14).
however, currently available direct thrombin inhibitors are recommended as an alternative therapy in patients who developed hit while on ufh.

heparin antidotes
untoward clinical effects of lmwhs can be antagonized by protamine. protamine
neutralization is determined by using citrated plasma–supplemented systems. usually an
lmwh (5.0 mg/ml) is supplemented by protamine 5.0 mg/ml. anti-factor iia and
anti- xxxg741xxx  activities are measured before and after addition of protamine and the results are expressed as percent neutralization. the highest degree of neutralization is observed with ufh.  xxxd214xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx  are neutralized to a large extent, while  xxxd2690xxx , enoxaparin, and  xxxd1805xxx  are neutralized only to a relatively small degree (13,14).
the degree of neutralization is a function of the anti-factor iia for the different lmwhs
(i.e., a lmwh with relatively higher anti-factor iia activity is more susceptible to neutralization by protamine sulfate).
lmwhs are neutralized to varying degrees by protamine sulfate addition (14). the
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity after iv administration of  xxxd3379xxx  is partially reversed by
protamine sulfate, whereas anti-factor iia and aptt activities are completely neutralized
(23). after s.c. administration, approximately 60 to 65% of peak anti-xa activity of  xxxd3379xxx  is neutralized by protamine sulfate. similar to iv administration, anti-iia and aptt
activities are nearly entirely reversed by protamine sulfate. however, after about 3 h a
gradual return of anti- xxxg741xxx  (65 to 75%), anti-factor iia (55%), and aptt (35 to 45%)
activities has been demonstrated. the cause of this return of activities is presumably a
continuing absorption of depot lmwh after s.c. administration. protamine sulfate was,
nevertheless, unable to suppress anti-xa activity entirely since excess product was detected after protamine administration (23).  xxxd3379xxx  has a relatively higher anti-factor
iia activity. this property makes it more susceptible to the reversal by protamine sulfate as
compared to other lmwhs, with higher anti-xa/iia ratios such as pentasaccharide (100%
anti- xxxg741xxx ) or enoxaparin.

lmwhs vs. pentasaccharide
recognizing the clinical usefulness of lmwhs, the american college of chest physicians’ consensus conferences have unequivocally endorsed the use of lmwhs in highrisk major surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement and high risk multiple trauma
(1,22). the consensus statements included favorable comments for lmwhs in contrast to
the oral anticoagulant drugs for knee surgery. needless to say, these recommendations are
based on well-designed clinical trials and were objectively developed by a panel of ex-

perts. it is also important that such recommendations have taken into account the product-specific clinical outcome. the published 1998 consensus statement provided additional supportive data for the expanded use of lmwhs in various indications. besides the
prophylaxis of post surgical and medical dvt/pe, treatment guidelines were also endorsed. the pentasaccharide, as a synthetic heparin derivative, will also have a significant
role in prophylaxis (59) and in other yet to be documented indications. for comparison between lmwhs and pentasaccharide see table 2.

differentiation of lmwhs in relation
to plasmatic versus vascular effects
anti-xa activity serves as the primary biomarker for assessing the exposure to
lmwhs. it is used to define the in vitro potency and to monitor therapeutic response.
given that lmwhs are polycomponent moieties with multiple biological actions, each
with a distinct time course, the true pharmacokinetic behavior of these agents cannot be
assessed with assays developed for a single pharmacological activity. heparin has multiple effects beyond anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activities ranging from the inhibition
of  xxxg748xxx  activity to the enhancement of  xxxg2266xxx  levels. these effects lead to a shift in
the tf/ xxxg2266xxx  ratio, a more important upstream component as compared to the factors
xa/iia ratio (19,47).
clinical trials were conducted with lmwhs with distinct in vitro potency (anti-factor
xa: anti-factor iia ratio) and ex vivo activities. anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activities
were evaluated in dvt patients undergoing hip replacement. no differences in the efficacy or safety of lmwhs were found despite distinct differences in biomarker activity
profiles. lmwhs vary in their affinity for at iii, presumably due to differences in the

production methods for glycosoaminoglycans (gags) and their molecular weight distribution (5,8). in contrast,  xxxg2266xxx , an at iii-independent vascular endothelial biomarker,
might be more useful in the elucidation of the role of lmwhs in various diseases and in
differentiating lmwhs from each other.
vascular  xxxg2266xxx  is synthesized and constitutively secreted by endothelial cells (21).
a major portion of the intravascular  xxxg2266xxx  is stored in association with endothelial cells
(21).  xxxg2266xxx  has valuable effects on various cellular and vascular events that might broaden
the efficacy and utility of heparin and its derivatives. effects on plasma  xxxg2266xxx  as well as
pharmacodynamic characteristics of  xxxd3379xxx  and a  xxxd3379xxx -like lmwhs, at
175 iu/kg s.c., were studied using a crossover single administration to healthy volunteers
with one week washout period before crossover (54).
plasma levels of  xxxg2266xxx  increased rapidly following subcutaneous injection of  xxxd3379xxx 
sodium reaching maximum and sustained levels for up to 5 h. the absolute bioavailability
was approximately 90% based on anti- xxxg741xxx  activity (55) and 95% based on  xxxg2266xxx  release (45).
the effect of molecular weight on the bioavailability of heparin has been well appreciated and anti- xxxg741xxx  activity was accepted early as a sensitive biomarker for the heparin fractions with various molecular weights. whether or not these fractions had any pharmacological activity has been the subject of debate. no studies have been published on the
consequences of variation in molecular weight distribution using a common method of
lmwh production. several studies suggested, however, that anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activities are two of several characteristics distinguishing the various lmwhs
(5,32,34).
in vitro studies from our laboratory demonstrated a significant role of the molecular
weight distribution and sulfation on the release of  xxxg2266xxx  from human endothelial cells. the
higher is the molecular weight of heparin fractions, the greater is the release of  xxxg2266xxx .
there was no significant release after pentasaccharide (1700 da), while the optimal release was observed with 8000–10,000 da fractions. studies in a rabbit model demonstrated a lack of change in plasma  xxxg2266xxx  after pentasaccharide and significant increase in
plasma  xxxg2266xxx  with heparin (63). previous studies with other lmwhs in comparison to
ufh demonstrated improved pharmacodynamics for lmwhs and increased plasma  xxxg2266xxx 
levels. studies with other lmwhs such as enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  in normal healthy
volunteers demonstrated ~2-fold elevation of plasma  xxxg2266xxx  as compared to basal levels
after s.c. administration of lmwhs at doses used in the treatment of dvt (4,42). heparin
was also shown to increase plasma levels of tfpis in patients with spontaneous dvt (24).
due to the key role of heparin in the regulation of  xxxg2266xxx  production and release from endothelial cells, as well as significant effects of  xxxg2266xxx  in various vascular, inflammatory, cardiovascular, hematological and oncological disorders (3,33,50), heparin is expected to
have an expanded role beyond its well-known anticoagulant function.
comparisons across various lmwhs are less straightforward. the biomarker response
from one agent may not be applicable to another with respect to outcome. it may very well
be that a composite of several markers is required to make such comparisons. continued
exploration of mechanistic determinants of activity are needed to better quantify the effects of these important medicines.

expanded role for lmwhs
beyond anticoagulation
in the coming years the role of lmwhs will be expanded for both, thrombotic and
non-thrombotic indications. a greater emphasis is currently being placed on the non-anticoagulant properties of these agents. some of the clinical effects of many of these
products are not explainable in terms of their anticoagulant effects. newer formulations,
drug combinations, extended use and long-term effects of these drugs will be important in
the optimization of therapy with lmwhs. in the future, pharmacoeconomics will play a
key role in their expanded use and optimization. selection of a proper agent for a given indication, dosing, management of adverse reactions and substitution therapy represent
some of the areas where valid clinical trials are needed. cost remains an important factor
in providing optimized medical care. an objective approach is crucial in streamlining
critical pathways and optimizing pharmacoeconomics. identification of products for specific indications and knowledge of individual lmwhs will be extremely helpful in the
proper use of these agents.
there are several newer clinical trials in progress using different products in indication-specific protocols. these trials are designed to investigate the effects of lmwhs in
the treatment of dvt/pe, cancer associated thrombosis and several additional cardiovascular indications. each of these trials is designed either empirically or on the basis of the
results from pilot trials with a given product. the dosages used are product-specific. some
of these trials employ relatively high dosages for long periods of times. in these situations,
each product will have its own clinical profile. the results of these trials will certainly validate the notion that not all lmwhs are the same.
