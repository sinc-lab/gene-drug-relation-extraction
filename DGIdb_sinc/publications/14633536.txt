the effect of dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, such as
chlorpromazine and haloperidol, on pupil size in
awake subjects suggests that these drugs might also alter pupillary reflex dilation and pupil size during general anesthesia. forty-seven patients undergoing lower
abdominal surgery under combined epidural/general
anesthesia were randomized to receive one of the 5 following open labeled drugs: 10 ml saline, 0.13 mg/kg
ondansetron, 0.25 mg/kg metoclopramide, 0.5 mg/kg
metoclopramide, or 0.02 mg/kg  xxxd1945xxx . three
measurements of reflex dilation were taken at 5-min intervals and after the last measurement (time 0) the drug
was administered. measurements were then taken 5,
10, 20, and 40 min after iv drug administration. reflex
dilation was induced by intermittent noxious stimulation of the c5 dermatome with a tetanic electric current

iosis is often considered an effect of opioids
during anesthesia because these drugs constrict the pupil and block the dilation produced by nociception (1– 4). however, there are other
drugs that might produce pupillary effects similar to
opioids. for example, some dopamine  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists, such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and
 xxxd3431xxx , produce pupillary constriction during
the awake state (5), and if similar drugs are given
during anesthesia the ensuing miosis could be mistaken for an opioid-related effect. furthermore these
drugs might block pupillary reflex dilation (prd) and
thus interfere with the pupillometric determination of
sensory block levels during combined epiduralgeneral anesthesia (6). accordingly, the effect of the
antiemetics  xxxd1945xxx , metoclopramide, and ondansetron on pupil size and prd during combined
epidural/general anesthesia was studied. whereas

(60 –70 mamp, 100 hz, 3-s duration) after a stable level
of epidural analgesia had been established with 3/8%
 xxxd383xxx  and maintained with a continuous infusion. metoclopramide produced a small decrease in pupil diameter and transiently depressed reflex dilation,
whereas  xxxd1945xxx  decreased pupil size  xxxd1891xxx  min and
depressed reflex dilation throughout the 40-min study
period. maximal change in reflex dilation was ⫺6.6 ⫾
3.3 mm-sec after  xxxd1945xxx . ondansetron had no effect
on pupil diameter or reflex dilation. when pupillary
diameter measurements are used to gauge opioid levels
during experimental conditions or during surgical anesthesia, antiemetic medication acting on the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  should be avoided.
(anesth analg 2003;97:1652–6)

 xxxd1945xxx  and metoclopramide are primarily dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, ondansetron is primarily a 5ht3 antagonist. the hypothesis was that the
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists would constrict the
pupil and depress prd, whereas ondansetron would
have no effect.

methods
after approval from the university of california committee on human research and obtaining informed
written consent, we studied 55 patients undergoing
surgical procedures on the lower abdomen for which
combined epidural/general anesthesia was the anesthetic technique. all were asa physical status i or ii,
free of eye disease, not receiving opioids for chronic
painful conditions, and not morbidly obese.
midazolam (1–2 mg) was administered iv for sedation, and a low thoracic epidural catheter was positioned using loss of resistance to an air- or saline-filled
syringe. after a negative test dose of lidocaine (3 ml,
1.5% with epinephrine), 10 –20 ml of 0.375%  xxxd383xxx  was administered via the epidural catheter. the
exact dose depended on the age and height of the
patient. a continuous infusion of 0.375%  xxxd383xxx 
(6 –10 ml/h) was started to maintain the block during

the procedure. anesthesia was induced with propofol,
1.5–3 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide, 0.6 –1 mg/kg,
was administered to facilitate intubation of the trachea. isoflurane (end-tidal concentrations 0.55%–
0.70%) in air:oxygen (50%:50%) was administered to
maintain anesthesia, and intermittent boluses of rocuronium bromide were given to maintain muscular
relaxation. opioids were not used.
hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure less than
65 mm hg) was treated by a continuous infusion of
phenylephrine 0.1– 0.5 ␮g · kg⫺1 · min⫺1 and/or a
fluid bolus of 500 ml ringer’s lactate solution or
blood when indicated. ventilation of the lungs of each
patient was adjusted to maintain end-tidal co2 between 28 and 38 mm hg. body temperature was maintained between 35.5°c and 37°c using a forced airwarming blanket (bair hugger; augustine medical,
minneapolis, mn).
routine anesthetic monitors, including continuous
oxyhemoglobin saturation (n200 pulse oximeter; nellcor, hayward, ca) and electrocardiographic monitoring, were used in all cases. oscillometric blood pressure was measured with a dinamap tm 1846 sx
(critikon, tampa, fl). end-tidal gas concentrations
were determined by a capnomac ii® (datex medical
instrumentation, tewksbury, ma). core temperature
was measured in the distal esophagus using an esophageal stethoscope (mon-a-therm®, st. louis.).
prd was measured using a portable infrared pupillometer (fairville medical optics, amersham, uk)
(6). stainless steel needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously to deliver a tetanic electrical stimulus.
two pairs of such electrodes were used. the lower
pair was placed along the flank of each patient approximately two dermatomes above the upper end of
the anticipated skin incision. blockade of the surgical
site was predicted if tetanic current failed to dilate the
pupil when these electrodes were activated (6) and
then confirmed by failure of the pupil to dilate after
the skin incision. the upper pair of electrodes was
placed on the lateral aspect of the shoulder (c5) above
the level of the local anesthetic blockade and was used
to assess the effect of study drugs on prd. for each
measurement of prd, cutaneous electrical stimulation
(100 hz, 60 ma) was delivered for 3 s via the subcutaneous electrodes. pupillary diameter was measured
at 20 hz for a 10-s period from the onset of the
electrical stimulation. prd was calculated as the pupillary dilation above baseline pupil diameter (aab)
for the duration of the 10-s scan (i.e., area above baseline on the pupil diameter versus time graph) (4).
baseline diameter was the pupil diameter at the start
of each scan. a laptop computer was programmed to
simultaneously deliver the 3 s stimulus and begin the
10 s pupillary scan and then calculate the aab pupil
diameter for each scan (fig. 1). only one 10-s scan was
taken at each testing interval.

metoclopramide at time zero. electrical noxious stimulation (shown
by double arrow) was given for the first 3 s of each scan. scans are
shown for the ⫺5 min, ⫹5 min, and ⫹ 20 min measurements. labels
to the right of each scan designate the time before or after metoclopramide; the area above the baseline diameter (aab) for each scan
is in parenthesis. the diagonal arrow points to the area above the
baseline diameter for the ⫹5 s scan. pupil size diminished slightly
after the drug and pupillary reflex dilation was depressed.

the sensory block level was considered to be stable
if, at least 1 h after surgery, the pupil was miotic, its
size was stable, and stimulation of the lower set of
electrodes failed to dilate the pupil. when these criteria were met, baseline prd was begun after stimulations of the c5 dermatome. three measurements were
taken at 5 min intervals and after the last measurement, each patient was randomly assigned to receive
one of the following bolus iv treatments: 1) saline
10 ml, 2)  xxxd1945xxx  0.02 mg/kg, 3) ondansetron
0.13 mg/kg 4) metoclopramide 0.25 mg/kg, or 5) metoclopramide 0.5 mg/kg. to arrive at these dosages
based on body weight, we used the following upper
limit bolus doses, calculated for a 60 kg patient as
follows:  xxxd1945xxx , 1.2 mg; ondansetron, 8 mg; metoclopramide, 15 mg; and metoclopramide, 30 mg.
randomization was performed by a draw from 5 labeled cards; the investigator was not blinded after the
draw. drugs were administered in 10 ml of saline
slowly over a 1-min period. basal pupil diameter and
prd were then measured after stimulation of the upper dermatome at 5, 10, 20, and 40 min after the start
of drug administration. fractional changes in pupil
size were made by comparing the baseline diameter at
each time interval with the baseline diameter taken at
time zero, just before drug administration.
the average of the three predrug prd measurements was labeled “baseline prd” and the maximum
change, either positive or negative, for each patient
was called “maximum change in prd.” we compared
the five groups with respect to maximum change in

results
the study was continued until at least 8 patients were
included in each group. of the 55 enrolled patients, 8
were not studied, 2 because an ineffective epidural
block could not be established and 6 because the surgical time was too short to complete the study. demographic data for the 47 subjects are shown in table 1.
age, body weight, dose of phenylephrine infusion,
pre-drug prd, end-tidal isoflurane concentration, and
basal pupil diameter before stimulations began did
not differ among the groups. likewise pupil size and
prd were stable for the three measurements taken
before drug administration and did not differ among
groups. prd decreased at 5 min for both doses of
metoclopramide and for  xxxd1945xxx  at 5, 10, 20, and
40 min (fig. 2). pupil size was diminished  xxxd1891xxx  min for
the small dose of metoclopramide and for  xxxd1945xxx 
but was unchanged for the other groups (fig. 3). the
antagonism of prd was short-lived for metoclopramide but persisted throughout the 40 min measurement period for  xxxd1945xxx  (fig. 2). the maximum
change of prd for the  xxxd1945xxx  and metoclopramide
groups was significantly different from the saline
group (table 1). although the maximal change in prd
was larger for the large dose metoclopramide group
compared with the small dose metoclopramide group,
the difference was not statistically significant (table
1). ondansetron did not affect prd or pupil size (figs.
2 and 3, table 1). post hoc calculations, based on the
variability of the 3 predrug prd measurements, revealed that a 30% change from baseline prd could be

discussion
general anesthesia with modern inhaled anesthetics
and propofol induce miosis (2– 6), but during surgery,
nociception dilates the pupil unless drugs are administered to block this dilation. the mechanisms involved in blocking prd during general anesthesia are
not fully understood. in anesthetized cats, noxious
stimulation dilates the pupil via ␣-2 adrenergic receptor inhibition of the pupilloconstrictor nucleus (8).
alpha 2 adrenergic antagonists prevent the dilation
induced by nociceptive stimuli (8). the human pupil
responds to ␣ 2 adrenergic agonists and antagonists
differently than the cat (9), so other transmitters and
neural pathways must be involved in the changes in
pupil size that are brought about by noxious stimulation in anesthetized humans. it has been reported that

prd is blocked by opioids (3). this effect explains, in
part, why miosis is commonly observed after opioid
administration during general anesthesia.
in this study, metoclopramide and  xxxd1945xxx  both
depressed prd, whereas ondansetron had no effect.
the effect on pupil size was minimal, perhaps because
the pupil was small as a result of the combined
epidural/general anesthetic. metoclopramide and
 xxxd1945xxx  are both dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists
(10), whereas ondansetron is not known to possess
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonistic activity. this suggests that dopamine  xxxg656xxx  blockade may be
the mode of action involved in the constriction of the
pupil and the depression of prd observed in this study.
however, the effect of metoclopramide was not dose
related. furthermore, both metoclopramide and
 xxxd1945xxx  have other weak pharmacologic properties
that might account for the depression in prd that we
observed.
metoclopramide has central dopamine  xxxg656xxx 
blocking effects, but it has also been shown to inhibit
certain cholinesterases in both animals and humans
(11). although the effect of metoclopramide on the
pupillary sphincter has not been studied, if it significantly enhanced the activity of acetylcholine at this
site via inhibition of cholinesterase, the effect would be
to diminish prd just as we have observed.
metoclopramide also has weak 5ht3 blocking activity, but ondansetron also shares this pharmacologic
property and did not depress prd. from this we
conclude that blockade of this receptor is not involved
in the control of pupil size during general anesthesia.

many dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, such as
 xxxd1945xxx , have ␣-1 adrenergic blocking activity. this
pharmacological property could theoretically induce
miosis and depress prd by acting either at the peripheral ␣-1 receptor within the iris or centrally at the
pupilloconstrictor nucleus.
several studies suggest that dopaminergic transmission may be involved in the reactions and size of the
pupil. amphetamine, a drug that acts in part by releasing dopamine within the brain, causes mydriasis
in the cervically sympathectomized dog, and this centrally mediated action is antagonized by haloperidol
(12).  xxxg2149xxx  blockers, such as  xxxd2746xxx , bupropion, and  xxxd145xxx , produce mydriasis in rabbits (13). topically applied  xxxd2498xxx , a combined dopamine d1 and d2 agonist, dilates both the
ipsilateral and the contralateral rabbit pupil, and this
effect is blocked by metoclopramide (14). reserpine, a
drug that depletes central dopamine stores (as well as
those of norepinephrine) is thought to produce miosis
in rabbits in part by increasing activity within the
pupilloconstrictor nucleus (15). although an early
study reported that the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist
bromocriptine did not alter pupil size in humans, this
study was performed with a dot comparison pupillometer (16). later photographic studies have demonstrated a mydriatic effect of bromocriptine (17).
alfentanil blocks prd during general anesthesia (3).
analgesics might interfere with transmission of the
noxious stimulus at several sites within the ascending
pain pathway. it is possible that dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists have analgesic properties and the reduction of prd that we observed was attributable to
blockade of nociception, perhaps within the spinal
cord. the depressant action of  xxxd1945xxx  on spinal
sensory neurons suggests that dopamine  xxxg656xxx 
antagonism or some other property of this drug might
interfere with nociception (18). however, clinical and
experimental studies relating to the analgesic properties of dopamine agonists and dopamine  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists are conflicting. iv metoclopramide does
not add to morphine analgesia after cesarean delivery,
but epidural  xxxd1945xxx  has been reported to potentiate epidural opioid analgesia (19). bolus injections of
metoclopramide alone have not been shown to consistently produce analgesia in humans (20). in animal
studies, most of the evidence suggests that dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  agonists enhance morphine analgesia (21).
limitations of this study are that it was conducted
on patients having surgery with combined epidural/
general anesthesia and larger than normal doses of
antiemetics were used. the large doses were used to
avoid missing an effect that might not be apparent
with smaller doses. although the combined technique
did introduce other drugs into the study, an attempt
was made to limit the number of drugs used during

1656

administration of the anesthetic. one goal was to observe the effect of these drugs on prd using this
technique. prd has been used to quantify the sensory
block level during combined epidural/general anesthesia, and a profound depressant effect by the antiemetics might interfere with this assessment.  xxxd1945xxx  depressed the reflex to the greatest extent and,
when used in this dose range, might prevent the detection of sensory block levels during combined
epidural/general anesthesia with the previously described technique (6).
there is no evidence that either the vasopressor or
the local anesthetic accounted for the effects that were
observed. systemically administered sympathomimetic drugs such as phenylephrine dilate the cat pupil, but there is no evidence that routine doses of these
drugs given iv alter pupil size in humans (22). furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the
dosage of this drug among groups and no evidence
that it accounted for the differences that were observed. similarly it is unlikely that the segmental
spread of a continuous infusion of  xxxd383xxx  at a
constant rate would abruptly raise the block level into
the cervical dermatomes.
in summary, the effect of three commonly used
antiemetics on the dilation of the pupil brought about
by noxious stimulation during light epidural-general
anesthesia was studied. two antiemetics, both dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, constricted the pupil
and depressed prd. thus, when observations of the
pupil are made to assess opioid effect during anesthesia, dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists should be
avoided.
