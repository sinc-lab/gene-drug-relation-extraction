homologous to dnaj and dnak are involved in
some aspect of the maturation of [fe-s]-clustercontaining proteins. it appears that the basic
biochemical features of [fe-s] cluster formation
are strongly conserved in nature, since organisms
from all three life kingdoms contain the same
consortium of homologous proteins required for
[fe-s] cluster formation that were discovered in
the eubacteria.

abstract
iron-sulphur ([fe-s]) clusters are simple inorganic prosthetic groups that are contained in a
variety of proteins having functions related to
electron transfer, gene regulation, environmental
sensing and substrate activation. in spite of their
simple structures, biological [fe-s] clusters are
not formed spontaneously. rather, a consortium
of highly conserved proteins is required for both
the formation of [fe-s] clusters and their insertion
into various protein partners. among the [fe-s]
cluster biosynthetic proteins are included a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme ( xxxg1562xxx ) that is
involved in the activation of sulphur from lcysteine, and a molecular scaffold protein (nifu)
upon which [fe-s] cluster precursors are formed.
t h e formation or transfer of [fe-s] clusters
appears to require an electron-transfer step. another complexity is that molecular chaperones

the nucleotide sequence of nifu, as well as
comparison with the sequences of other proteins,
reveals that it contains three modules (figure 1).
t h e n-terminal module contains three cysteine
residues that are necessary for formation of the
[fe-s] clusters used for nitrogenase maturation
[6,7]. because [fe-s] clusters assembled at this
site are destined for transfer to other proteins, they
have been designated as ‘ transient ’ clusters. t h e
central module of nifu contains four cysteines, all
of which are necessary to co-ordinate a redoxactive [2fe-2s] cluster. there is one [ 2 f  xxxd2037xxx  s ]
cluster contained within each subunit of the asisolated form of each nifu homodimer. these
[2fe-2s] clusters are not transferred to other
proteins, so they have been designated as ‘permanent’ clusters. t h e exact function of the
permanent clusters is not yet known, but they are
required for the physiological functioning of nifu
as well as for in vitro nifu-directed maturation of
the nitrogenase fe protein. because the transient
clusters are released upon reduction in vitro, and
because the permanent clusters are redox-active, a
working model is that the permanent clusters are
involved in the physiological release of the transient clusters during nitrogenase component protein maturation. t h e third module is located
within the c-terminal region of niflj. t h e significant feature of this module is that it contains a
-cys-xaa-xaa-cys- signature within a sequence
context somewhat similar to that in thioredoxins,
so this region has been designated as the ‘thio-

process of nitrogen fixation. inactivation of either
 xxxg1562xxx  or nifu results in the accumulation of nitrogenase deficient in both fe protein and mofe
protein activities.
because the common feature of these proteins
is that they both contain [fe-s] clusters, it was
suggested that  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu encode proteins that
are involved in the formation of the [fe-s] clusters
necessary for nitrogenase activity [3,4]. this hypothesis was tested and confirmed by purification
of  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu, and the subsequent analysis of
their catalytic functions.  xxxg1562xxx  is a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme that uses l-cysteine as
a substrate to form an enzyme-bound cysteine
persulphide [5]. persulphides formed on  xxxg1562xxx 
represent the ultimate sulphur source for nitrogenase-specific [fe-s] cluster formation. nifu is
a modular homodimeric protein that provides a
molecular scaffold for the  xxxg1562xxx -directed formation
of [fe-s] clusters [6]. because  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu are
able to form a transient macromolecular complex,
the current model is that  xxxg1562xxx  donates sulphur
to nifu, with subsequent acquisition of iron to
assemble [fe-s] clusters on the nifu scaffold.
t h e [fe-s] clusters assembled in this way are then
incorporated into the nitrogenase catalytic components by a process that is not yet understood.

role of nifu
t h e role of nifu as a scaffold for [fe-s] cluster
assembly appears complicated. examination of

redoxin-like ’ module, although its function is not
yet known.

a comparison of the organization of the nifspecific and housekeeping [fe-s] cluster biosynthetic genes from a. vinelandii is shown in
figure 1. the genomes of most gram-negative
bacteria determined to date show the same housekeeping [fe-s] cluster biosynthetic gene organization as shown in figure 1, with the exception that
some do not contain cyse2. t h e housekeeping
counterparts of  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu are indicated as  xxxg1562xxx 
and iscu respectively. t h e ‘ isc’ designation indicates the involvement of the products of these
genes in iron-sulphur-cluster formation.  xxxg1562xxx  and
 xxxg1562xxx  are about the same size, exhibit conservation
throughout their sequences when compared with
each other, and are both pyridoxal phosphatedependent homodimers that catalyse the removal
of sulphur from l-cysteine [13]. in contrast, iscu
is much smaller than nifu and bears sequence
similarity only with the n-terminal transientcluster module within nifu. in vitro experiments
have shown that enzyme-bound persulphides can
be transferred from  xxxg1562xxx  to iscu, and that transient [2fe-2s] and [4fe-4s] clusters can be
formed sequentially on iscu [14-161. although
there is no permanent [2fe-2s] cluster within
iscu, another protein encoded within the housekeeping gene region, designated fdx, does contain
a [2fe-2s] cluster [13]. t h e biophysical properties of the [2fe-2s] cluster contained within fdx
are nearly identical with those of the permanent
[2fe-2s] clusters contained in nifu [17], so it is
possible they have parallel functions. no homologue of the nifu thioredoxin-like module is
encoded in the housekeeping gene region, although a small gene encoding a protein with a
similar sequence is located elsewhere in the
genome. in addition to  xxxg1562xxx  and iscu, a homologue to iscanif,designated isca, is also encoded
within the housekeeping gene region [13]. similar
to results with iscanif,it has been shown that a
transient cluster can also be assembled on isca
[18]. furthermore, genetic studies have shown
that isca is not as physiologically important as
iscu and  xxxg1562xxx , which also mirrors the situation
found for the corresponding nif proteins [19].
an unanticipated aspect of the housekeeping
[fe-s] cluster gene region is the presence of
apparently co-transcribed molecular chaperones
encoded by hsca and hscb [ 131. t h e proteins encoded by these genes have extensive sequence
similarity with the well characterized molecular
chaperones dnak and dnaj respectively. furthermore, iscu interacts with hscba, which
greatly stimulates the intrinsic atpase activity of

cyse i and iscanif
there are two other nif-specific genes whose
products are likely to be involved in nitrogenase
[fe-s] cluster formation. one of these, indicated
in figure 1 as cysel, encodes a protein homologous to 0-acetylserine synthase [8,9], which
catalyses the rate-limiting step in cysteine biosynthesis. it is likely that cysel boosts the
formation of l-cysteine that is required to accommodate the activity of  xxxg1562xxx  during nitrogenase
[fe-s] cluster formation [9]. t h e other gene is
designated isca””. t h e function of iscaxifis not
yet known, and genetic studies have shown that it
is dispensable [lo]. however, biochemical studies
have shown that iscanifcan also serve as an [fe-s]
cluster assembly scaffold in vitro, indicating that it
might be involved in nitrogenase [fe-s] cluster
formation under special physiological conditions
[ l l ] . other possibilities are that iscanifis involved
in nitrogenase [fe-s] cluster repair, or that it has
a specialized role involving the formation of the
permanent [2fe-2s] clusters contained in nif u.

housekeeping [fe-s] cluster
biosynthetic genes
because nitrogenase represents a significant fraction of the total soluble protein in nitrogen-fixing
azotobacter vinelandii [12], the experimental bacterium used in our laboratory, we considered the
possibility that  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu activities represent
a way to boost normal cellular [fe-s] cluster
biosynthetic activities in response to an increased
demand for [fe-s] cluster formation under
nitrogen-fixing conditions. also, although the
inactivation of either  xxxg1562xxx  or nifu significantly
decreases the accumulation of active nitrogenase
components, such lesions do not eliminate nitrogenase activities. we reasoned that this observation could be explained if there are non-nif
genes that encode proteins similar in structure and
function to  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu, which can functionally replace them at a low level. we therefore
searched for, and found, genes clustered within
the a. vinelandii genome that bear significant sequence similarity to  xxxg1562xxx  and nifu [13]. because
of the involvement of these other gene products in
the maturation of [fe-s] proteins necessary for
general cellular processes, e.g. respiration and
carbon assimilation, we refer to them as having
‘housekeeping ’ functions related to [fe-s] cluster
assembly.

particular protein is controlled by the threedimensional arrangement of the [fe-s] cluster
ligands in the final structure. one possibility is
that the role of hscba involves maintaining the
structural integrity of the iscu scaffold, rather
than participating directly in [fe-s] cluster formation or insertion.
t h e final gene contained within the isc gene
cluster is iscr. this gene was originally given this
designation because it shows some sequence conservation when compared with a family of tran-

the hscba complex [20]. although genetic studies
have shown that the molecular chaperone complex
encoded by hscba is involved in either the
activation or the maintenance of [fe-s] proteins,
their exact role remains to be determined [13,191.
it seems unlikely to us that hscba assists in the
insertion of clusters into [fe-s] proteins while
they are folded, because it is easy to chemically
remove and re-insert [fe-s] clusters into so many
proteins. also, the available evidence indicates
that the [fe-s] cluster type contained within a

scriptional regulators. kiley and collaborators [21]
have demonstrated recently that iscr is a negative
regulatory protein. in their studies it was shown
that deletion of iscr results in elevated expression
of the [fe-s] cluster assembly genes in vivo, and
isolated iscr inhibits their expression in vitro.
also, inactivation of either  xxxg1562xxx  or hsca, both of
which are required for full [fe-s] cluster formation, results in a markedly elevated expression of
the isc genes. because a fraction of as-isolated iscr
contains a [2fe-2s] cluster, it has been suggested
that the repressing form of iscr will be the
[2fe-2s]-cluster-containing form. recent data
from our laboratory support this possibility: we
have found that substitution of alanine for any of
three conserved cysteines within iscr, probable
ligands for the [2fe-2s] cluster, as well as certain
substitutions within iscu that prevent [fe-s]
cluster formation or transfer, result in a dramatic
increase in expression of the isc genes. t h e current
model is that iscr feedback regulates gene expression depending on whether or not it contains a
[2fe-2s] cluster. this model provides a mechanism for integrating [fe-s] cluster formation in
response to the availability of fe or s, or a demand
for [fe-s] cluster formation. it is also important
to note that regulation of the isc transcriptional
unit is likely to have an additional layer of
complexity, because the function of  xxxg1562xxx  is apparently not restricted to [fe-s] cluster assembly.
recent work performed in a variety of different
laboratories has shown that  xxxg1562xxx  is likely to be
involved as an agent of sulphur trafficking that
includes sulphur insertion into other cofactors, as
well as the thiolation of trna [22-251.

evolutionary aspects
t h e basic features of the biochemical machinery
involved in [fe-s] cluster formation have been
strongly conserved throughout most of nature.
this is evident in figure 2, which compares the
sequences of iscu homologues from a variety of
organisms, representing all three life kingdoms.
this comparison shows that the three cysteines
necessary for transient [fe-s] cluster assembly are
strictly conserved. although most free-living organisms that require [fe-s] cluster formation for
survival contain iscu homologues, there are organisms, e.g. synechococcus and certain extremophiles, which do not contain an obvious iscu
homologue. how these organisms form [fe-s]
clusters is not yet known. however, all higher
organisms examined so far, e.g. yeast, human, and

0 2002 biochemical society

arabidopsis (see figure 2), have iscu homologues,
as well as homologues of isca,  xxxg1562xxx , hscb, hsca
and fdx. genetic studies with yeast have shown
that all of these isc homologues have some role in
[fe-s] cluster formation or in establishing iron
homoeostasis (reviewed in [26]). a remarkable
difference between higher organisms and bacteria
with regard to [fe-s] cluster formation is that,
in higher organisms, [fe-s] cluster formation
is largely compartmentalized within the mitochondrion. indeed, lill and co-workers [26] have
made persuasive arguments that a primary function of the mitochondrion is to provide a favourable environment for [fe-s] cluster assembly.
thus an additional level of complexity of [fe-s]
cluster assembly in higher organisms involves the
export of [fe-s] clusters from the mitochondrion
to other cellular locations.

on iron for survival. in spite of its essential nature,
the redox capacities of iron underlie its high
potential toxicity. consequently, organisms have
evolved complex mechanisms for the tight regulation of iron uptake, storage and utilization.
i n bacteria, iron homoeostasis is triggered
mainly at the transcriptional level through the
actions of fur (ferric uptake repressor)- and dtxr
(diphtheria toxin repressor)-like regulators (reviewed in [ l]), whereas in vertebrates intracellular
iron concentrations are controlled largely posttranscriptionally by iron regulatory proteins
(irps). irps exert their effects by high-affinity
binding to so-called iron responsive elements,
stem-loop structures that are located in the untranslated regions of mrnas coding for the
regulated proteins (for reviews, see [2,3]). interestingly, i r p l is identical with the cluster-free
apoform of vertebrate cytoplasmatic aconitase (ec
4.2.1.3), which belongs to a widely distributed and
phylogenetically closely related class of enzymes
that employs an interconvertible, redox-inactive
[4fee4s] iron-sulphur cluster for catalytic activity
(reviewed in [4,5]). t h e switch between posttranscriptional regulator and enzyme is mediated
through the assembly/disassembly of the ironsulphur cluster [ 2 4 ] . although best characterized
in mammalia, recent work has demonstrated irplike functions of c-type (cytoplasmic type) aconitases in a variety of organisms, ranging from lower
invertebrates to bacteria [1,2,6]. in fact, nothing is
known about iron regulation in archaea.
recently, we published the first purification
and characterization of an archaeal aconitase [7].

abstract
t h e aconitase of sulfolobus solfataricus, a hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon, was cloned and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. enzymic
analyses and epr measurements indicated clearly
that the iron-sulphur cluster of the thermophilic aconitase was already inserted in the
mesophilic host. t h e enzyme was purified to a
specific activity of approx. 44 units/mg and to
90 o , ) homogeneity. t h e enzymic parameters of
the recombinant aconitase turned out to be in the
same range as the respective values for the previously characterized native enzyme from the closely
related s . acidocaldarius. based on its primary
sequence, the recombinant aconitase is closely
related to bacterial a-like and to eukaryotic iron
regulatory protein-like proteins. specific aconitase
activities in cytosolic extracts of s . acidocaldarius
were found to be decreased markedly in ironstarved compared with iron-repleted cells. however, no differences in aconitase levels between
iron-starved and iron-supplemented cells could be
detected by immunostaining.
