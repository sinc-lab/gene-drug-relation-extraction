pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ®) is a novel  xxxg730xxx  (er) antagonist that competitively binds to the er with a much greater affinity than that of tamoxifen. the
downregulation of cellular levels of the er protein results in complete abrogation
of estrogen-sensitive gene transcription. this distinct mechanism of action
ensures a lack of cross resistance with other hormonal agents and, in contrast to
tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  has no known estrogen-agonist effects.
 xxxd2165xxx  is administered via monthly intramuscular injections (250mg) and
is recommended for the treatment of  xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic breast
cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen
therapy.
the efficacy of  xxxd2165xxx  was similar to that of the aromatase inhibitor
anastrozole (1 mg/day) in two, well designed studies in postmenopausal women
with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed during prior
antiestrogen therapy. time to disease progression (primary endpoint) and treatment failure, rates of objective response and clinical benefit, overall survival and
quality of life were similar in patients treated with  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole. in
retrospective noninferiority analyses,  xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective as
anastrozole in all randomised patients, and in those with or without visceral
metastases.
 xxxd2165xxx  is generally well tolerated and was tolerated as well as anastrozole
in clinical trials. treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild to moderate
and led to treatment withdrawal in about 1% of patients who received  xxxd2165xxx 
or anastrozole. the main adverse effects associated with therapy are nausea,
asthenia, pain, vasodilation and headache.
in conclusion, monthly intramuscular injections of  xxxd2165xxx  are at least as
effective and as well tolerated as oral anastrozole once daily in the treatment of
postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer that has progressed on prior
antiestrogen therapy. because of a different mode of action to that of other
hormonal agents,  xxxd2165xxx  is effective in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant
disease and, unlike tamoxifen, has no known estrogen agonist effects. thus,
 xxxd2165xxx  provides an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of
 xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women
with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.
 xxxd2165xxx  binds competitively to estrogen receptors (er), with an affinity
similar to that of estradiol, but greater than that of tamoxifen. by binding to er,
 xxxd2165xxx  triggers a series of changes in er function (including inhibited
dimerisation, restricted uptake into the nucleus and increased turnover) that
downregulates er. thus,  xxxd2165xxx  results in the complete abrogation of transcription of er-regulated genes and is, therefore, an effective er antagonist, with
no known estrogen-agonist activity.
in clinical trials in women with postmenopausal breast cancer,  xxxd2165xxx 
downregulated er to a significantly greater extent than tamoxifen and was
associated with significantly reduced levels of expression of the estrogen-regulated progesterone-receptor gene compared with placebo. similarly, in studies in
healthy postmenopausal women,  xxxd2165xxx  demonstrated no estrogen-agonist
activity on the endometrium during short-term administration. the thickness of

the endometrium was significantly less in women who received  xxxd2165xxx  in
combination with  xxxd2054xxx  than in those who received placebo plus
 xxxd2054xxx , demonstrating that  xxxd2165xxx  has an anti-estrogenic effect.
other pharmacodynamic effects of  xxxd2165xxx  demonstrated in in vitro and in
vivo studies include cellular aromatase inhibition, insulin-like growth
factor-signalling pathway inhibition, anti-progestin activity and nongenomic
effects.
 xxxd2165xxx  inhibits cellular proliferation in estrogen-responsive cells in in
vitro and in vivo models of human breast cancer. tamoxifen-resistant cell lines
and in vivo tumour models of breast cancer remain sensitive to growth inhibition
by  xxxd2165xxx . both preclinical and clinical studies indicate that  xxxd2165xxx 
increases apoptosis.  xxxd2165xxx  was significantly more effective in reducing cell
turnover index (a composite measure of both proliferation and apoptosis) than oral
tamoxifen in a partially blind, multicentre trial in postmenopausal women with
er-positive breast cancer.
the mean maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of  xxxd2165xxx  was reached
approximately 7 days after single- or multiple-dose intramuscular administration.
plasma concentrations were maintained over a 28-day interval, with minimum
plasma concentrations (cmin) being approximately one-third that of cmax. with
once-monthly intramuscular administration of  xxxd2165xxx , plasma concentrations
reached steady state after approximately three to six doses. mean exposure to the
drug increased after multiple doses; the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve in the first 28 days at steady state was approximately 3-fold higher than that
after a single dose of the drug. cmin values at steady state after multiple doses
were similar to cmax values after a single dose.
the administration regimen (either as a single 5ml or two concurrent 2.5ml
intramuscular injections) did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2165xxx .
the apparent volume of distribution of  xxxd2165xxx  is approximately 3–5 l/kg.
plasma protein binding of  xxxd2165xxx  is high (99%). total body clearance of
 xxxd2165xxx  from plasma after an intramuscular injection of a 250mg dose is 690
ml/min.
according to studies involving human liver preparations and recombinant
human enzymes,  xxxd2165xxx  is metabolised by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 and
not other cyp isoenzymes.
 xxxd2165xxx  has a long elimination half-life (40 days).  xxxd2165xxx  is recovered
almost entirely in the faeces, with negligible renal elimination (<1%). preliminary
studies suggest that mild hepatic or renal impairment does not affect plasma
concentrations of  xxxd2165xxx .
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2165xxx  were not significantly altered by coadministration with rifampicin or ketoconazole.  xxxd2165xxx  did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.
the efficacy of intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  250mg once each month appeared to be
similar to that of oral anastrozole 1 mg/day in two, well designed studies in
postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had
progressed during prior antiestrogen therapy. retrospective noninferiority analyses indicated that  xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective as anastrozole in this patient
group.

the time to disease progression (primary endpoint) with  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole was 5.5 versus 5.1 months in one trial, and in the other, was 5.4 versus 3.4
months (nonsignificant differences). in both studies, objective response rates with
 xxxd2165xxx  (20.7 and 17.5%) were similar to those achieved with anastrozole (15.7
and 17.5%), as were the rates of clinical benefit, times to treatment failure and
quality-of-life scores. patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  had a significantly greater
duration of response than those receiving anastrozole, when all patients were
included in the analysis and nonresponders scored zero. a similar overall survival
was achieved with  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole in a prospective combined analysis
of data from both trials. in a retrospective analysis of combined data,  xxxd2165xxx 
was at least as effective as anastrozole in patients with or without visceral
metastases.
 xxxd2165xxx  is generally well tolerated, and in clinical trials it was tolerated as well
as anastrozole. treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild to moderate
and occurred in 46 and 40% of patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole,
respectively, in a retrospective analysis of data from two comparative trials
prospectively designed for combination. about 1% of patients in each treatment
group withdrew from either study because of adverse events.
the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole
therapy, which may or may not have been treatment related, were nausea (26.0
versus 25.3%), asthenia (22.7 versus 27.0%), pain (18.9 versus 20.3%), vasodilation (17.7 versus 17.3%) and headache (15.4 versus 16.8%). hot flushes occurred
in about one-fifth of patients in both treatment groups. across both studies, joint
pain (arthritis, arthrosis and arthralgia) was significantly more common in patients
treated with anastrozole than in those treated with  xxxd2165xxx . injection-site
reactions appeared to be related to the number of  xxxd2165xxx  injections administered, and none were serious.
 xxxd2165xxx  is indicated for the treatment of  xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic
breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following
antiestrogen therapy.  xxxd2165xxx  250mg is administered once monthly as a single
5ml or two concurrent 2.5ml intramuscular injections.
no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. pregnancy must be excluded before initiating treatment with  xxxd2165xxx .
for women who are nursing infants, either nursing or the drug should be
discontinued, based on the importance of the drug to the mother.

1. introduction
the risk of developing breast cancer increases
with increasing age, and postmenopausal women,
i.e. those aged ≥50 years, account for about 77% of
newly diagnosed cases.[1] although breast cancer
remains a leading cause of death from malignancy in
women, second only to lung cancer, mortality rates
have recently declined.[1] between 1987 and 1997,
death rates from breast cancer in women aged 50–69

years reduced by 22% in the uk, and by 18% in the
us.[2] this reduction in mortality is attributed to
improvements in diagnosis and treatment.[2]
hormones, particularly estrogens, play an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.[3] the
action of estrogen on breast cancer cells is mediated
by estrogen receptors (er), and at the time of diagnosis, about two-thirds of breast cancer tumours
contain estrogen and/or progesterone receptors; the

2. pharmacodynamic properties
the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2165xxx ,
which were previously reported in drugs,[6] are updated and briefly summarised (see tables i and ii) in
this review.
 xxxd2165xxx  binds competitively to er, with an
affinity similar to that of estradiol, but greater than
that of tamoxifen (see table i).  xxxd2165xxx , by binding to er, triggers a series of changes in er function (including inhibited dimerisation,[9,10] restricted
uptake into the nucleus[13] and increased turnover[10,14]) that reduces the cellular levels of er (er
downregulation;[15,16] see table i and figure 1). both
transcriptional activating functions of er (af-1 and
af-2) are blocked when  xxxd2165xxx  binds to er.[32]
thus, unlike tamoxifen, which blocks only af-2,[33]
 xxxd2165xxx  results in the complete abrogation of

presence of which indicates a greater likelihood of
response to hormonal therapy.[3] depriving the tumour cells of estrogenic stimulation often leads to a
clinical response in patients with receptor-positive
disease.[4] although estrogen levels are relatively
low in postmenopausal women, levels are still sufficient to affect cancer cell growth.[5]
the nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen has
been the most widely used hormonal agent in postmenopausal women and remains a standard firstline therapeutic agent.[4] if a tumour response was
achieved with first-line therapy, second-line hormonal agents appear more likely to achieve additional
benefit at the time of disease progression or ‘tamoxifen resistance’ (section 7), and over recent years a
number of alternative hormonal therapies have been
developed.[4]  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ®1) is the first of
a new type of steroidal er antagonists (or er
downregulators, or ‘pure’ antiestrogens), and unlike
tamoxifen, appears to have no estrogen agonist effect (section 2). this review focuses on the use of
 xxxd2165xxx  for the treatment of hormone-receptor
positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal
women whose disease has progressed on prior antiestrogen therapy.

to a single intramuscular injection of  xxxd2165xxx  50mg (n = 39),
125mg (n = 38) or 250mg (n = 44), oral tamoxifen 20mg (n = 36) or

transcription of er-regulated genes (see table i and
figure 1). therefore, in contrast to tamoxifen,
 xxxd2165xxx  is an effective er antagonist, with no
known estrogen-agonist activity, as confirmed by
data from preclinical and clinical studies (see table
i).
for example, in clinical trials in women with
postmenopausal breast cancer,  xxxd2165xxx  250mg
downregulated er to a significantly greater extent
than tamoxifen (see figure 1).[16] moreover,  xxxd2165xxx  was associated with reduced levels of expression of the estrogen-regulated progesterone-receptor
(pgr) gene compared with placebo, indicating that
 xxxd2165xxx  is devoid of estrogen-agonist activity.[16]
tamoxifen, with a different mode of action, resulted
in partial estrogen-agonist activity, as demonstrated
by increased pgr levels versus placebo (see figure
1). similarly, in studies in healthy postmenopausal
women,  xxxd2165xxx  demonstrated no estrogenic ago-

been demonstrated in preclinical studies (see table

the ability of  xxxd2165xxx  to inhibit cellular proliferation in estrogen-responsive cells has been demonstrated in in vitro[7,34-38] and in vivo[11,41] models of
human breast cancer (see table ii). moreover, reduced ki67 expression indicates that  xxxd2165xxx 
produces anti-proliferative effects in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer[15,16,39] (also
see section 4.1). tamoxifen-resistant cell lines[40]

cti was reduced to a significantly greater extent
with a single intramuscular injection of  xxxd2165xxx

and 49% versus 4%; both p < 0.01) and with a single

3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2165xxx ,
which were previously reported in drugs,[6] are updated and briefly summarised (see table iii) in this
review.
the mean maximum plasma concentration
(cmax) of  xxxd2165xxx  was reached after approximately 7 days after single- (see table iii) or multipledose intramuscular administration.[46-48] plasma
concentrations were maintained over a 28-day interval, with minimum plasma concentrations (cmin)
being approximately one-third that of cmax. with
once-monthly intramuscular administration of
 xxxd2165xxx , plasma concentrations reached steady
state after approximately three to six doses.[46] mean
exposure to the drug increased after multiple doses;
the area under the plasma concentration-time curve
in the first 28 days at steady state was approximately
3-fold higher than that after a single dose of the drug
(see table iii). cmin values at steady state after
multiple doses were similar to cmax values after a
single dose (see table iii).
the administration regimen (either as a single
5ml or two concurrent 2.5ml intramuscular injections) did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of
 xxxd2165xxx  (see table iii).[46,47]
the apparent volume of distribution of  xxxd2165xxx  is approximately 3–5 l/kg, suggesting extravascular distribution.[48] plasma protein binding of
 xxxd2165xxx  is high (99%), with low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein being involved.
total body clearance of  xxxd2165xxx  from plasma
after an intramuscular injection of a 250mg dose is
690 ml/min.[48]

 xxxd2165xxx  is likely to be metabolised by oxidation, aromatic hydroxylation, conjugation with glucuronic acid and/or sulphate at the 2, 3 and 17
positions of the steroid nucleus and oxidation of the
side chain sulphoxide.[48] the metabolites have similar or reduced activity to that of  xxxd2165xxx  in antiestrogen models. according to studies involving
human liver preparations and recombinant human

p450 (cyp) 3a4 and not other cyp isoenzymes.
however, the relative in vivo contribution of cyp
and non-cyp pathways of metabolism is not
clear.[48]
 xxxd2165xxx  has a long elimination half-life (40
days).[48] in healthy volunteers, ≥90% of a radiolabelled dose of  xxxd2165xxx  was recovered almost
entirely in the faeces.[49] renal elimination is negligible (<1%).[48]
in a study in patients with locally advanced or
metastatic breast cancer with normal liver function
(n = 261) or mild hepatic impairment (n = 24)
administered a single dose of  xxxd2165xxx  250mg,

there was no relationship between  xxxd2165xxx  clearance and hepatic impairment.[48] patients with hepatic impairment had alt concentrations greater than
the upper limit of normal (uln), but less than twice
the uln, or two of the following parameters between 1- to 2-times the uln; ast, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin.[48]
studies specifically investigating the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2165xxx  in patients with renal impairment have not been conducted; nevertheless, in clinical trials in patients with advanced breast cancer,
 xxxd2165xxx  plasma concentrations in women with
low creatinine clearance (estimated 30 ml/min)
were similar to those with normal creatinine clearance.[48]
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2165xxx  were not
significantly altered by coadministration with rifampicin (a potent and nonspecific cyp3a4 inducer) or
ketoconazole (a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor) in
healthy volunteers.[50] moreover,  xxxd2165xxx  did not
alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a
cyp3a4 substrate).[50]

4. clinical efficacy
the clinical efficacy of intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx 
250mg monthly has been compared with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (1mg tablet daily) in two large, randomised trials (table iv) in
postmenopausal women with locally advanced or
metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on
previous adjuvant or first-line antiestrogen therapy
for advanced disease; both trials are fully published
and individual results are discussed in section
4.1.[51,52] analyses of combined data from these two
studies are discussed in section 4.2.[53,54]
the design of the studies (one conducted in north
america[52] the other predominantly in europe[51])
was the same except for two points of difference;
one was nonblind and  xxxd2165xxx  was delivered as a
single 5ml injection,[51] and the other was doubleblind and  xxxd2165xxx  was delivered via two 2.5ml
injections, one in each buttock.[52] hormone sensitivity was confirmed by er or pgr positivity or by
sensitivity to prior antiestrogen therapy.[51,52]
exclusion criteria included more than one prior
treatment with hormonal agents for advanced breast
cancer (adjuvant therapy with hormonal agents may
also have been given to some patients), extensive
radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the past 4
weeks and treatment with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues within the past 3
months.[51,52] in both studies, the average age was
about 63 (range 33–94) years, with patients in the
two treatment groups well matched with respect to

age, weight, breast cancer history and  xxxg1603xxx  status.[51,52] only those patients with a life
expectancy >3 months were included in the trials.
chemotherapy agents for advanced breast cancer
had been used previously in about 43%[51] and
63%[52] of patients. in both studies, about half of the
patients had received prior antiestrogen therapy
(tamoxifen in ≥95% of patients) for advanced disease and half as adjuvant therapy. [52]
efficacy was assessed on an intent-to-treat basis,
and the primary efficacy endpoint was time to disease progression (ttp; time from randomisation
until objective disease progression or death).[51,52]
secondary endpoints included objective response
(complete plus partial response) [based on international union against cancer criteria], time to treatment failure (ttf; time from randomisation until
disease progression, death or withdrawal from treatment for any reason), quality-of-life (qol) assessments, clinical benefit (complete plus partial response plus stable disease ≥24 weeks) and duration
of response.[51,52]
study medications were continued until there
was objective evidence of disease progression or
until the patient withdrew from the trial. the first 30
patients in each study received  xxxd2165xxx  125mg
per month for 3 months, but because of a lack of
response to this lower dosage, this dosage regimen
was discontinued, and these data were not included
in the efficacy analyses. an interim analysis was
performed when 170 events had occurred and as a
result, statistical significance levels for ttp and

objective response rates were adjusted from 5 to

noninferiority of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole was
applied retrospectively.[51,52]
4.1 comparative trials

in both the nonblind (predominantly european)[51] and double-blind (north american)[52] studies, there was no statistically significant difference
in the ttp between patients treated with  xxxd2165xxx 
and those treated with anastrozole (table iv). in the
nonblind trial, patients were followed for a median
period of 14.4 months and, at the time of analysis,
82% of patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  and 83% of
patients receiving anastrozole had evidence of disease progression (hazard ratio of 0.98; 95.14% ci
0.80, 1.21; p = 0.84).[51] similarly, in the doubleblind study, disease progression occurred in 84 and
86% of the  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole groups, at a
median follow-up period of 16.8 months (hazard
ratio of 0.92; 95.14% ci 0.74, 1.14; p = 0.43).[52]
these data, from both studies, demonstrated
noninferiority of  xxxd2165xxx  compared with anastrozole.[51,52]
the ttf was also similar in both treatment
groups of both trials (table iv), with the main
(≈95%) cause of treatment failure attributable to
disease progression, as opposed to adverse events,
protocol noncompliance or withdrawal of informed
consent.[51,52]
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

the rates of objective response (table iv) and
clinical benefit achieved with  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole also demonstrated similar efficacy between
the two agents.[51,52] in the nonblind study, the difference in response rates was 4.8% (95.14% ci
–2.19%, 14.23%), with the odds of attaining an
objective response being 38% higher in the  xxxd2165xxx  group than in the anastrozole group (odds ratio
1.38; 95.14% ci 0.84, 2.29; p = 0.20).[51] in the
double-blind study, the difference in response rates
was 0.17% (95.14% ci –6.31%, 9.30%), with an
odds ratio of 1.01 (95.14% ci 0.59, 1.73; p =
0.96).[52] clinical benefit was observed in 45% of
patients treated with  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole in
one study,[51] and in the other, 42 and 36% (nonsignificant difference) of patients showed clinical
benefit.[52]
at an extended follow up of about 22 months in
both studies, the mean duration of response (assessed from the onset of response to disease progression for responders and assigned a value of zero in
nonresponders) was significantly greater with
 xxxd2165xxx  than with anastrozole; ratio of mean duration of response was 1.27 (95% ci 1.05, 1.55; p =
0.01) in one study[51] and in the other, the ratio was
1.35 (95% ci 1.10, 1.67; p < 0.01).[52] when measured in responders only, the median duration of
response in the double-blind study was 19 months in
the  xxxd2165xxx  group (n = 36) versus 10.8 months in
the anastrozole group (n = 34),[52] and in the
nonblind study, respective values were 15 months (n
= 48) versus 14.5 months (n = 39) [statistical anadrugs 2004; 64 (6)

 xxxd2165xxx : a review

4.2.1 in total patient population

the two clinical trials discussed in section 4.1
were prospectively designed for retrospective analyses of combined data.[53] in the intent-to-treat populations, efficacy results reported in the combined
analysis (n = 851; 428 received  xxxd2165xxx  and 423
received anastrozole) were similar to those achieved
in the individual trials (section 4.1). the estimated
median ttp was 5.5 months for  xxxd2165xxx  compared with 4.1 months for anastrozole (hazard ratio
of 0.95; 95.14% ci 0.82, 1.10; p = 0.48) at a median
follow up of 15.1 months.[53] the rates of objective
response in the  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole groups
were 19.2 versus 16.5%, with a difference of 2.75%
(95.14% ci 2.27%, 9.05%; p = 0.31). the differences between treatment groups in the ttf and the
clinical benefit achieved were also not statistically
significant.[53]
as shown in the individual trials, a significant
difference between treatment groups, in favour of
 xxxd2165xxx , was shown for duration of response
when all randomised patients were included (nonresponders scored 0); ratio of mean duration of
response at a median follow up of 22.1 months was
1.30 (95% ci 1.13, 1.50; p < 0.01).[53]
the overall survival associated with  xxxd2165xxx 
or anastrozole therapy was similar in a recent analysis performed after ≥75% of patients had died;
data are reported in an abstract.[55] at an extended
median follow up of 27.2 months, 74.5% of patients
in the  xxxd2165xxx  group and 76.1% of patients in the

a retrospective analysis, using combined data
from the two trials discussed in section 4.1, compared the response of patients with and without
visceral metastases to intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  or
oral anastrozole.[54] visceral metastases (i.e. metastases to the liver and/or lung) were present in 381 of
851 patients (45%) and of these, 59% also had
metastases to skin, bone or other nonvisceral tissue).
in the group of patients with visceral metastases
only, more had lung tumours than liver tumours in
both treatment groups, but more patients with both
lung and liver tumours were randomised to anastrozole than to  xxxd2165xxx  (21 and 9%). patient
follow up continued for a median of 15.1 months.[54]
the rate of objective response and clinical benefit was similar in the  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole
treatment groups and in subgroups with and without
visceral disease (figure 3).[54] the difference in the
objective response rate between treatment groups in
patients without visceral metastases (n = 470) was
2.62% (95% ci –4.08, 11.28; p = 0.48), and in all
patients with visceral metastases (n = 381) the difference was 2.51% (95% ci –3.68, 11.77; p = 0.49).
the duration of response appeared to be durable
with both drugs in all subgroups. in patients without
visceral metastases, the median duration of response
was 14.3 months with  xxxd2165xxx  and 13.7 months
with anastrozole, and in those with visceral metastases, only or as well as other tumours, the respective
median duration of response was 17.5 months and
11.7 months.[54] of particular interest in this study,
in the subgroup of patients with visceral metastases
only, a complete response was achieved in 10% of
the  xxxd2165xxx  group but only 1% of the anastrozole
group (analysis of statistical significance not performed).[54]

combined analysis.[53] a similar incidence of treatment-related adverse events occurred in patients
receiving  xxxd2165xxx  (46%) or anastrozole (40%)
and, in most cases, events were mild to moderate in
intensity.[53] in both treatment groups, about 1% of
patients withdrew from the trials because of adverse
events, and <2% experienced a serious adverse
event that was possibly related to study medication.[53]

group as in the  xxxd2165xxx  group (figure 4).[53] hot
flushes are considered a classic estrogen withdrawal
symptom, and these occurred in about one-fifth of
patients in both treatment groups.[53] nausea and
vomiting were the main events contributing to gastrointestinal disturbances.[53]
the most common adverse events across both
studies, irrespective of whether they were related to
treatment, were nausea (26.0 versus 25.3%), asthenia (22.7 versus 27.0%), pain (18.9 versus 20.3%),
vasodilation (17.7 versus 17.3%) and headache
(15.4 versus 16.8%), and the incidence appeared to
be similar in patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole, respectively.[53]
injection site reactions, including pain, haemorrhage and inflammation, appeared to be related to
the number of injections administered, with about
7% of patients (1.1% of treatments) receiving
 xxxd2165xxx  250mg via one 5ml intramuscular injection reporting injection site adverse events[51] compared with 27% of patients (4.6% of treatments)
receiving  xxxd2165xxx  250mg via two 2.5ml intramuscular injections.[52] none of these events were
serious.[51,52]
6. dosage and administration
 xxxd2165xxx  is indicated for the treatment of  xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic breast cancer in
postmenopausal women with disease progression
following antiestrogen therapy.  xxxd2165xxx  250mg
is administered once monthly as a single 5ml or two
concurrent 2.5ml intramuscular injections, which
should be administered slowly.[48]
no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (section 3).
studies have not investigated the tolerability and
efficacy of  xxxd2165xxx  in patients with moderate or
severe hepatic impairment.[48]
pregnancy must be excluded before initiating
treatment with  xxxd2165xxx .[48] for women who are
nursing infants, either nursing or  xxxd2165xxx  should
be discontinued, based on the importance of the drug
to the mother.[48]

7. place of  xxxd2165xxx  in the
management of hormone
receptor-positive metastatic breast
cancer in postmenopausal women with
disease progression following
antiestrogen therapy
the ultimate goal of treatment in patients with
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is to
balance the objectives of improving survival with
those of improving qol.[56] hormonal therapy is
particularly useful in patients with hormone-sensitive disease, as it effectively inhibits the growth of
breast tumours in most patients but is associated
with minimal toxicity.[5] in postmenopausal women,
there are two key approaches to the treatment of
hormone-sensitive breast cancer: preventing estrogen from binding to the er using an antiestrogen
or lowering estrogen levels using an aromatase inhibitor.[51]
tamoxifen, a selective er modulator (serm),
has been the most widely used antiestrogen over the
past 30 years[57] and remains a first-line treatment
option.[58] tamoxifen has both an er antagonist and
a partial er agonist effect and, as a result, long-term
therapy is associated with increased endometrial
proliferation and an increased risk of endometrial
cancer.[33] the partial agonist effect of tamoxifen is
also thought to be responsible for the development
of ‘tamoxifen resistance’, a condition where the
drug ceases to inhibit tumour growth and appears to
promote it.[33] however, beneficial effects are also
associated with tamoxifen therapy, including an increase in bone mineral density.[59] other serms,
including  xxxd3402xxx  and raloxifene, have not demonstrated a therapeutic advantage over tamoxifen.[57]
aromatase inhibitors act by inhibiting the conversion of adrenal-derived androgen to estrogen in
postmenopausal women.[5] the third-generation,
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole and
letrozole have demonstrated greater efficacy than
tamoxifen when used as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women[60,61] and are now also recommended for first-line treatment of this patient
group.[58] the optimal sequence of hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women, following an antiesdrugs 2004; 64 (6)

trogen and/or an aromatase inhibitor has not been
fully clarified.[5] options include  xxxd2165xxx , a
progestogen ( xxxd2557xxx ) or an aromatase
inactivator (exemestane).[5]
 xxxd2165xxx  is a novel er antagonist with a different mode of action to that of tamoxifen (section 2),
and it is recommended for the treatment of hormone
receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy (section 6).[48]  xxxd2165xxx  competitively binds to the er with a much
greater affinity than that of tamoxifen, and has no
known estrogen-agonist effects (section 2).[16,19]
thus, unlike tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  is not likely to
be associated with an increased risk of endometrial
cancer. in addition,  xxxd2165xxx  was active against
tamoxifen-resistant cell lines[40] (section 2) and was
effective in clinical trials in patients with disease
progression on prior tamoxifen therapy (≥95% of
patients in clinical trials discussed in section 4.1),
indicating a lack of cross-resistance with tamoxifen,
unlike other serms, and supporting its use in patients with acquired resistance to tamoxifen.
similar efficacy was demonstrated with  xxxd2165xxx  (intramuscular 250mg injection monthly) or
anastrozole (1mg tablet daily) in two large, well
designed studies in postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer progressing after prior antiestrogen therapy (section 4.1).[51,52] the ttp (primary endpoint), ttf, rates of objective response
and clinical benefit and qol were not significantly
different between patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  and
those receiving anastrozole in both studies. moreover, at an extended median follow up of 27.2
months, overall survival was similar in both treatment groups. a retrospective noninferiority analysis
of both studies suggested that  xxxd2165xxx  was at
least as effective as anastrozole for postmenopausal
patients with advanced breast cancer that had
progressed following antiestrogen therapy.
in a further retrospective analysis, patients with
visceral metastases performed as well as patients
without visceral metastases, and once again,  xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective as anastrozole in both

mckeage et al.

subgroups (section 4.2.2).[54] patients with visceral
metastases are often regarded as less likely to respond to hormonal therapy than patients without visceral metastases;[54] however, this analysis suggests,
on the basis of retrospective data, that the presence
of visceral metastases alone appears not to be adequate grounds to exclude patients from further hormonal treatment beyond disease progression.[54]
 xxxd2165xxx  is generally well tolerated and was
tolerated as well as anastrozole in clinical trials
(section 5). a similar incidence of adverse events
occurred in patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  or anastrozole and the majority of cases were mild to moderate in intensity. the most common adverse events
in both treatment groups were nausea, asthenia,
pain, vasodilation and headache. joint disorders, a
recognised adverse effect of aromatase inhibitors,[53]
occurred in more patients receiving anastrozole than
 xxxd2165xxx  (section 5). injection site reactions were
not serious, and the incidence appeared to be related
to the number of injections administered.
while  xxxd2165xxx  has shown efficacy subsequent
to tamoxifen therapy (section 4), its efficacy following aromatase inhibitors is yet to be fully addressed.[57] ongoing and future clinical trials will
help clarify the optimal sequence of hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer, as well as investigating combination
therapy regimens with antiproliferative agents such
as gefitinib.[57]
in conclusion, monthly intramuscular injections
of  xxxd2165xxx  are at least as effective and as well
tolerated as oral anastrozole once daily in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer that has progressed on prior antiestrogen therapy. because of a different mode of action to that of other hormonal agents,  xxxd2165xxx  is
effective in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant disease and, unlike tamoxifen, has no known estrogen
agonist effects. thus,  xxxd2165xxx  provides an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of
 xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic breast cancer
in postmenopausal women with disease progression
