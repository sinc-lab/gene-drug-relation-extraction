abstract

purpose: targeting of kitand platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1710xxx ) tyrosine kinases
by imatinib is an effective anticancer strategy. however, mutations of the gatekeeper residue
(t670 in  xxxg1279xxx  and t681 in pdgfrh) render the two kinases resistant to imatinib. the aim of this
study was to evaluate whether sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx ), a multitargeted atp-competitive
inhibitor of kitand  xxxg1710xxx , was active against imatinib-resistant kitand pdgfrh kinases.
experimental design: we used in vitro kinase assays and immunoblot with phosphospecific
antibodies to determine the activity of sorafenib on kitand pdgfrh kinases. we also exploited
reporter luciferase assays to measure the effects of sorafenib on  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh downstream
signaling events. the activity of sorafenib on  xxxg1177xxx  ^ independent proliferation of ba/f3
cells expressing oncogenic kitor its imatinib-resistant t670i mutant was also tested.
results: sorafenib efficiently inhibited gatekeeper mutants of  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh (ic50 for  xxxg1279xxx 
t670i, 60 nmol/l; ic50 for pdgfrh t681i, 110 nmol/l). instead, it was less active against activation loop mutants of the two receptors (ic50 for  xxxg1279xxx  d816v, 3.8 amol/l; ic50 for pdgfrh d850v,
1.17 amol/l) that are also imatinib-resistant. sorafenib blocked receptor autophosphorylation and
signaling of  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh gatekeeper mutants in intact cells as well as activation of ap1responsive and  xxxg366xxx  gene promoters, respectively. finally, the compound inhibited kitdependent proliferation of ba/f3 cells expressing the oncogenic  xxxg1279xxx  mutant carrying the t670i
mutation.
conclusions: sorafenib might be a promising anticancer agent for patients carrying  xxxg1279xxx  and
pdgfrh gatekeeper mutations.

the  xxxg1279xxx  and platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( xxxg1710xxx )
are members of the type iii subclass of receptor tyrosine
kinases.  xxxg1279xxx  is the receptor for stem cell factors (scf), whereas
 xxxg1709xxx  and pdgfrh are the receptors for platelet-derived
growth factors (pdgf; ref. 1). the structure of these receptors
includes an extracellular domain with five immunoglobulinlike motifs, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic  xxxg2198xxx  domain. the kinase domain is split by
a kinase insert sequence into an atp-binding region and a
phosphotransferase region (1).

 xxxg1279xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx , and pdgfrh are frequently activated in
neoplastic diseases. more than 30 gain-of-function mutations
in  xxxg1279xxx , either single amino acid changes or small deletions/
insertions, have been identified in such highly malignant
human neoplastic diseases as gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(gist) and mastocytosis. gists are the most common type of
sarcoma arising in the digestive tract and are generally
distinguished from other abdominal sarcomas by the expression of  xxxg1279xxx . approximately 80% of these tumors show
activating mutations in  xxxg1279xxx  (2). gist mutations cluster in
the  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane region, whereas most mutations
associated with mastocytosis target a specific aspartate residue
( xxxd816xxx ) in the kinase activation loop (3). fusion of  xxxg1709xxx 
with different genes has been found in chronic myeloid
leukemia and in hypereosinophilic syndrome (4). moreover,
gist cases that are negative for  xxxg1279xxx  mutations almost invariably
display activating point mutations in the juxtamembrane
domain or in the activation loop of  xxxg1709xxx  (5). the closely
related pdgfrh receptor is often activated by rearrangements
in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (6).
imatinib ( xxxd2333xxx , sti571; gleevec or glivec) is an
atp-competitive inhibitor that has revolutionized drug therapy
of chronic myeloid leukemia. imatinib is very effective [in vitro
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 25 nmol/l]
against the chronic myeloid leukemia – causing kinase bcr-abl
(7). it also efficiently inhibits  xxxg1279xxx  (in vitro ic50, 410 nmol/l)
and  xxxg1710xxx  (in vitro ic50, 380 nmol/l). consequently, it has

cancer therapy: preclinical

been successful in the treatment of cancer patients carrying
activating  xxxg1279xxx  or  xxxg1710xxx  mutations (2, 5, 7). in clinical studies,
75% to 90% of patients with advanced gists treated with
imatinib experienced a clinical benefit (7).
however,  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx  variants carrying mutations in
the kinase activation loop ( xxxd816xxx  in  xxxg1279xxx ; refs. 8, 9; and  xxxd842xxx 
in  xxxg1709xxx ; ref. 5, which corresponds to  xxxd850xxx  in pdgfrh)
are refractory to imatinib. therefore, mastocytosis ( xxxg1279xxx ) and
gist ( xxxg1279xxx  or  xxxg1709xxx ) patients with these mutations respond
poorly to imatinib (2, 5). x-ray analysis has shown that
imatinib binds preferentially to the inactive form of the kinase.
it is conceivable that these mutations disrupt the kinase
structure and so disable interaction with the drug (10).
moreover, some patients who initially respond to imatinib
subsequently relapse. this secondary resistance usually results
from the emergence of tumor clones with mutations in the
kinase domain that prevent drug binding. in particular, some
mutations in  xxxg1279xxx  (t670i; refs. 11 – 14) or  xxxg1710xxx  (t674i in
 xxxg1709xxx  and t681i in pdgfrh) cause imatinib resistance
(15–17). these mutations correspond to the thr315-to-isoleucine
substitution (t315i) in bcr-abl that frequently causes
resistance in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. given
its role in controlling the susceptibility of kinases to drug
inhibition, this particular residue has been designated as a
‘‘gatekeeper.’’ the gatekeeper threonine interacts with imatinib
via a hydrogen bond. it seems that its replacement with a large
bulky amino acid (isoleucine) prevents the drug-kinase
interaction (10). other mutations in  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  have
been reported to cause secondary resistance and these include
mutations of  xxxd816xxx  in  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxd842xxx  in  xxxg1709xxx  (2).
sorafenib, also known as bay43-9006, is a multikinase
inhibitor of the bi-aryl-urea chemical class (18). it targets the
raf family of serine/threonine kinases and the  xxxg2198xxx 
receptors  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ),  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ),  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , and
 xxxg1279xxx  (19). sorafenib is undergoing advanced clinical trials and
has been recently food and drug administration – approved
under the name of nexavar for the treatment of advanced renal
cell carcinoma (18). we recently showed that sorafenib is a
potent inhibitor of the wild-type and mutant ret kinase.
importantly, sorafenib also inhibited ret gatekeeper mutants
(v804m/l; ref. 20). here, we have investigated the activity of
sorafenib against imatinib-resistant  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh mutants.

materials and methods
compounds. sorafenib [ xxxd3226xxx , n -(3-trifluoromethyl-4chlorophenyl)-n ¶-(4-[2-methylcarbamoyl pyridin-4-yl]oxyphenyl)
urea], was provided by bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals. the compound was dissolved in dmso.
plasmids. pcmv- xxxg1279xxx , encoding wild-type mouse  xxxg1279xxx , and pcdna
3.1-pdgfrh, encoding wild-type human pdgfrh (21), were kindly
donated by c. sette (dept. sanita’ pubblica e biologie cellulare,
universita’ di roma, rome, italy) and c.h. heldin (ludwig institute for
cancer research, uppsala university, uppsala, sweden), respectively.
pdgfrh t681i and d850v mutants and  xxxg1279xxx  t670i and  xxxg1279xxx  d814v
mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. all the mutations
were confirmed by double-strand dna sequencing. because the mouse
 xxxg1279xxx  d814v mutation corresponds to the human  xxxg1279xxx  d816v, for the
sake of clarity, this mutant is called  xxxg1279xxx  d816v throughout this article.

cell cultures and luciferase assays. hek293 cells were from the
american type culture collection and were grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs, 2 mmol/l of l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of
penicillin-streptomycin (life technologies). nih3t3 fibroblasts were
cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mmol/l of
l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin. hela cells
were grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs, 2 mmol/l of
l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin.
transient transfections were carried out with the lipofectamine
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (life technologies).
hela cells (1  106) were transiently transfected with vectors expressing
 xxxg1279xxx  wt,  xxxg1279xxx  t670i and  xxxg1279xxx  d816v, and the  xxxg1222xxx -luciferase vector
(stratagene) containing six  xxxg1222xxx -binding sites upstream from the firefly
luciferase cdna. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serumstarved and 100 ng/ml of scf (prepotech) was added to the
 xxxg1279xxx  wt and  xxxg1279xxx  t670i– transfected cells. nih3t3 mouse fibroblasts
(1  106) were transiently transfected with vectors expressing pdgfrh
wt, pdgfrh t681i, or pdgfrh d850v, and with the  xxxg366xxx -luciferase
vector (22) containing -1,745 bp of the human  xxxg366xxx  promoter
upstream from the firefly luciferase cdna. this vector was kindly
provided by s.j. gutkind (nih, bethesda, md). twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were serum-starved and 100 ng/ml of pdgf bb
(prepotech) were added to pdgfrh wt and pdgfrh t681i – transfected
cells. ten nanograms of prl-null (a plasmid expressing the enzyme
renilla luciferase from renilla reniformis) was used as an internal control.
firefly and renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the dualluciferase reporter system (promega corporation). light emission was
quantitated using a berthold technologies luminometer (centro lb 960)
and expressed as a percentage of residual activity compared with
untreated cells. average results of three independent assays f sd are
indicated. student’s t test was used to assess statistical significance.
stable pools of ba/f3 cells expressing  xxxg1279xxx   xxxd557xxx -558 or the imatinibresistant  xxxd557xxx -558/t670i double mutant were selected for  xxxg1177xxx

with or without  xxxg1177xxx  culture supplement (bd biosciences). for cell
proliferation assays, ba/f3 cells were plated in complete medium with
or without  xxxg1177xxx  and different doses of sorafenib. after 72 h, cell growth
was evaluated by measuring luminescence with a celltiter-glo  xxxg1279xxx 
(promega corporation). average ic50 (nmol/l) of the compound for
ba/f3 cellular proliferation was calculated by using linear regression
methods (graphpad software inc.) from at least three experiments
(minus  xxxg1177xxx : n > 3; plus  xxxg1177xxx : n = 3) and was reported means f se.

results
sorafenib activity on  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  kinases. the ic50 of
sorafenib for  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh was 68 and 57 nmol/l,
respectively (19). we tested if sorafenib inhibits imatinibresistant  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh kinases that have mutations in the
gatekeeper residue ( xxxg1279xxx  t670i and pdgfrh t681i) or in the
activation loop ( xxxg1279xxx  d816v and pdgfrh d850v; fig. 1a).
in an immunocomplex kinase assay, we measured  xxxg1279xxx  t670i
and  xxxg1279xxx  d816v proteins’ autophosphorylation in vitro in the
presence of different sorafenib concentrations. the drug
strongly inhibited the t670i  xxxg1279xxx  gatekeeper mutant (ic50,
60 nmol/l), but it was less active on the d816v activation
loop mutant (ic50, 3.8 amol/l; fig. 1b). an in vitro kinase assay
with a gst- xxxg1279xxx  (tk) recombinant protein carrying the d816v
mutation confirmed these findings (data not shown). also, the

pdgfrh gatekeeper mutant (t681i) was potently inhibited by
sorafenib in vitro (ic50, 110 nmol/l). similar to the d816v  xxxg1279xxx 
mutant, the pdgfrh activation loop mutant (d850v) was less
efficiently inhibited (ic50, 1.17 amol/l; fig. 1c).
next, we tested the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on  xxxg1279xxx  and
pdgfrh autophosphorylation in intact cells. hek293 cells
were transiently transfected with either wild-type, gatekeeper, or
activation loop mutant receptors. transfected cells were treated
with different doses (0.1, 0.5, and 1 amol/l) of the compound
for 2 h. because they did not display detectable basal
phosphorylation levels, cells expressing wild-type or gatekeeper
mutant receptors were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of the
specific ligand (scf for  xxxg1279xxx  or pdgf bb for pdgfrh) for
10 min before harvesting. consistent with their oncogenic
properties, activation loop mutants displayed constitutive
kinase activity and did not require ligand stimulation (1).
receptor activation was monitored by western blotting with
specific phospho- xxxg1279xxx  (py721) and phospho-pdgfrh
(py1021) antibodies. relative phosphorylation levels in compound-treated compared with vehicle-treated cells were calculated with phosphorimager. sorafenib was very effective in
blocking wild-type  xxxg1279xxx  and pdfgrh phosphorylation (fig. 2).
at the 100 nmol/l dose, the compound blocked receptor
phosphorylation by >90%. moreover, gatekeeper mutants were
very sensitive to sorafenib (100 nmol/l sorafenib blocked  xxxg1279xxx 
t670i and pdgfrh t681i receptor phosphorylation in intact
cells by 80%; fig. 2). instead, the drug was clearly less active
against the activation loop mutants: 1 amol/l of sorafenib
inhibited  xxxg1279xxx  d816v and pdgfrh d850v by f70%, whereas
the inhibitory effect at 100 nmol/l was barely detectable.

cancer therapy: preclinical

sorafenib activity on  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  signaling. then, we
investigated whether sorafenib intercepts  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh
downstream signaling. ligand-stimulation of hek293 cells
adoptively expressing wild-type  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh or their
gatekeeper mutant – induced shc adaptor protein and mapk
phosphorylation (ref. 24; fig. 3). the activation loop mutants
of  xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh also induced shc and mapk phosphorylation and did not require ligand triggering because of their
constitutive kinase activity (fig. 3). treatment of cells with
different doses of sorafenib strongly inhibited wild-type and
gatekeeper mutant – dependent shc and mapk phosphorylation. in contrast, stimulation of shc and mapk phosphorylation by the activation loop mutants was less efficiently
blocked by sorafenib; in this case, marked inhibition was seen
only at a concentration of 1 amol/l (fig. 3).
the effects of sorafenib on  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  transcriptional
activity. in a first set of experiments, we noted that  xxxg1279xxx 
activation triggered the transcription of a luciferase reporter
downstream from an  xxxg1222xxx -responsive promoter in nih3t3
murine fibroblasts and that pdfgrh was a potent activator of
a  xxxg366xxx  promoter in hela cells. for pdfgrh, we could
not use nih3t3 cells because fibroblasts express endogenously
high levels of the receptor (data not shown). thus, we
evaluated whether sorafenib blocked receptor activity on these
promoters. the  xxxg1222xxx -luciferase reporter activity was hindered
when  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1279xxx  t670i cells were treated for 24 h with
0.1, 0.5, and 1 amol/l of sorafenib (f10-fold reduction at
1 amol/l; p < 0.02; fig. 3c). similarly,  xxxg366xxx -luciferase
promoter activity was inhibited when pdgfrh and pdgfrh

t681i cells were treated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 amol/l of
sorafenib (f40-fold reduction at 1 amol/l; p < 0.02; fig. 3d).
although sorafenib was less active on the activation loop
mutants of the two receptors, it still exerted a significant
inhibitory activity at 1 amol/l (f2-fold reduction of  xxxg1279xxx 
d816v and f7-fold reduction of pdgfrh d850v) and some
activity at 0.5 amol/l (1.5-fold reduction for  xxxg1279xxx  d816v and
4-fold reduction for pdgfrh d850v; p < 0.02; fig. 3c and d).
the effects of sorafenib on  xxxg1279xxx  mitogenic activity. the murine
pro – b cell line ba/f3 requires the cytokine  xxxg1177xxx  for proliferation and survival. expression of constitutively active  xxxg1279xxx 
mutants confers  xxxg1177xxx  – independent growth to ba/f3 cells (25).
thus, ba/f3 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing
either the imatinib-sensitive oncogenic  xxxg1279xxx  mutant containing
a deletion of residues 557 to 558 ( xxxd557xxx -558) in the juxtamembrane domain or the imatinib-insensitive  xxxg1279xxx  double
mutant containing both the  xxxd557xxx -558 and the t670i mutations
(3). in the absence of  xxxg1177xxx , sorafenib potently inhibited the
growth of both the  xxxd557xxx -558 and  xxxd557xxx -558/t670i  xxxg1279xxx  –
expressing cells (table 1). the compound had virtually no
effect on the proliferation of parental or ba/f3-transfected cells
grown in the presence of  xxxg1177xxx , indicating that the antiproliferative effects of the compound were selective and dependent on
activated  xxxg1279xxx  signaling (table 1).

discussion
here we show that sorafenib targets a number of mutant  xxxg1279xxx 
and pdgfrh kinases. thus, based on its advanced clinical

independent experiments. signal intensity

vectors expressing kitwt,  xxxg1279xxx  t670i, and  xxxg1279xxx  d816v, and the  xxxg1222xxx -luciferase vector.twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved and 100 ng/ml of scf was
added to the  xxxg1279xxx  wt and  xxxg1279xxx  t670i ^ transfected cells. d, hela cells (1  106) were transiently transfected with vectors expressing pdgfrh wt, and pdgfrh t681i- and
pdgfrh d850v, and with the  xxxg366xxx -luciferase vector. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved and 100 ng/ml of pdgf bb were added to pdgfrh
wt and pdgfrh t681i ^ transfected cells. the drug was added 24 h before harvesting at the indicated concentrations. luciferase activity is expressed as a percentage of
residual activity compared with cells that had not been treated with sorafenib. columns, average results of three independent assays; bars, sd; *, p < 0.02, student’s t test was
used to assess statistical significance (vehicle versus treatment).

development, sorafenib may be effective in the treatment of
cancer driven by  xxxg1279xxx  or  xxxg1710xxx  mutations. we also show that
sorafenib is less active against the activation loop mutants of
 xxxg1279xxx  and pdgfrh (d816v in  xxxg1279xxx  and d850v in pdgfrh) than
against wild-type and gatekeeper mutants (t670 in  xxxg1279xxx  and
t681 in pdgfrh) of the two receptors. nevertheless, in intact
cells, we observed the inhibition of activation loop mutants at
concentrations between 0.5 and 1.0 amol/l. whatever the
mechanism, such an increase in potency in cellular assays with

respect to in vitro kinase activity warrants further investigation
to verify whether sorafenib could also be used to inhibit these
mutants in a clinical setting.
noteworthy, other compounds proved their efficacy against
 xxxg1279xxx  or  xxxg1710xxx  activation loop mutants. these included
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), a small molecule inhibitor of src
and abl tyrosine kinases (26);  xxxd2642xxx , a staurosporinederived  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that targets protein kinase c;
 xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx  and  xxxg1279xxx  (15, 27), and exel-0862,

a novel kinase inhibitor active against fibroblast growth factor
receptors, vegfrs,  xxxg1710xxx ,  xxxg801xxx , and  xxxg1279xxx  (table 2; ref. 28).
on the other hand, gatekeeper mutation induces resistance to
many inhibitors, rendering the identification of second-line
treatments quite difficult (29 – 31). although other strategies
have been envisaged to counteract the activity of these mutants,
such as the use of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17allylamino-18-demethoxy- xxxd2187xxx  (32), compounds
able to inhibit gatekeeper mutants are urgently needed to
provide a solution to the challenge of molecular resistance due
to secondary mutations at this site. thus far, only a few
compounds have been reported to be active on these mutants.
 xxxd3264xxx  was found to inhibit the  xxxg1279xxx  t670i kinase (33, 34)
and  xxxd2642xxx  inhibited both  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  gatekeeper
mutants (table 2; refs. 15, 35). our data indicate that sorafenib
is active against  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  gatekeeper mutations. indeed,
these mutants were efficiently inhibited at a drug concentration
(60 nmol/l for  xxxg1279xxx  t670i and 110 nmol/l for pdgfrh t681i)
that is well below the average plasma concentration of the
drug. pharmacokinetic studies have shown that on multiple
oral doses of 400 mg b.i.d., the c max value of sorafenib was
9.35 mg/l, which corresponds to a concentration of f20 amol/l.
up to 99% of the drug is bound to serum proteins leading to
an unbound concentration of the drug of f200 nmol/l (36).

consistent with our findings, lierman and coworkers have
recently shown that fipl1- xxxg1709xxx , the oncogenic rearrangement of  xxxg1709xxx , another  xxxg1710xxx  family member, found in
hes (patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome),
and its t674i gatekeeper mutant are efficiently inhibited by
sorafenib (37).
in conclusion, our study suggests that sorafenib might be a
useful therapeutic agent to treat tumors harboring the imatinibresistant  xxxg1279xxx  t670i or  xxxg1710xxx  t681i mutants. in the chronic
myeloid leukemia model, it has been reported that the
combination of imatinib with an inhibitor of imatinib-resistant
bcr-abl mutants can be used to prevent the emergence of
resistance (38). similarly, the combination of sorafenib with
imatinib might be envisaged to reduce the risk of the emergence
of treatment-resistant neoplastic clones harboring  xxxg1279xxx  or
 xxxg1710xxx  mutants.
