the bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase (malp) catalyses the
phosphorolysis of an a-1,4-glycosidic bond in maltodextrins, removing
the non-reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose1-phosphate (glc1p). in contrast to the well-studied muscle glycogen
phosphorylase (gp), malp exhibits no allosteric properties and has a
higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than gp. we have used malp as
a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of maltodextrin synthesis. the 2.0 å crystal structure of the malp/glc1p binary
complex shows that the glc1p substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian gp, with the
phosphate group not in close contact with the 50 -phosphate group of the
essential  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) cofactor. in the active malp enzyme,
the residue arg569 stabilizes the negative-charged glc1p, whereas in the
inactive form of gp this key residue is held away from the catalytic site
by loop 280s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is
required for activation. the comparison between malp structures shows
that his377, through a hydrogen bond with the 6-hydroxyl group of
glc1p substrate, triggers a conformational change of the 380s loop. this
mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific
recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the malp ternary complex. the
structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides (either maltotetraose, g4 or maltopentaose, g5) into malp/glc1p crystals show the
formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain.
these structures, refined at 1.8 å and at 2.2 å, confirm that only when an
oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will glc1p bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the plp 50 phosphate group and
promote catalysis. the relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can
diffuse quickly into the malp/glc1p crystals and the enzymatic reaction
can occur without significant crystal damage. these structures obtained
before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular
movie. this movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the
catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein,
involving mainly arg569, which tracks the substrate phosphate group.

utilization of maltodextrins by escherichia coli
requires relief of catabolite repression of the mal
genes. these genes encode proteins involved in
the transport and metabolism of maltose and

of linear maltodextrins to yield glucose-1-phosphate (glc1p). the enzyme readily catalyses the
reverse reaction of glc1p plus oligosaccharide to
yield an oligosaccharide lengthened by one glucose
residue and liberation of inorganic phosphate. the
equilibrium constant (phosphate/glc1p) is 3.6 in
favor of the reverse reaction but in the cell the
reaction is driven in favor of glc1p production
because of the high concentration of phosphate
and the immediate utilization of glc1p in metabolism. the sequence of e. coli malp is 46% identical
with the mammalian glycogen phosphorylase (gp)
and nearly 100% identical at the catalytic site.2,3 in
comparison to the mammalian gp, malp is a
simpler enzyme. it is regulated neither by allosteric
effectors nor phosphorylation and it is expressed in
e. coli as a constitutively active enzyme.4 a structural explanation for the activity without allosteric
regulation has been provided by the crystal structure of e. coli malp and comparison of this
structure with the mammalian gp structures in
their inactive (gpb ) and active (phosphorylated)
(gpa ) states.5
malp has a relatively high affinity (mm) for
linear oligosaccharides, in contrast to gp, which

prefers the branched-chain glycogen polysaccharide.6,7 this feature has been exploited to
achieve a malp phosphorylase/maltopentaose
complex that demonstrated the critical interactions
important for oligosaccharide bound at the phosphorylase catalytic site.8 it allowed the formation
of a ternary enzyme complex with a thio-pentasaccharide (gsg4) and phosphate to mimic the
ternary enzyme/substrate complex seen in the
reverse physiological reaction. the crystal structures of oligosaccharide bound across the catalytic
site in both the binary and the ternary malp
enzyme/substrate complexes answered a long
outstanding question about phosphorylase recognition of oligosaccharide substrate.8 these
structures revealed the importance of the conformational change in the oligosaccharide substrate
in the formation of ternary complexes and provided support for the role of the 50 -phosphate
group of  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) in catalysis.
crystallographic studies on rabbit muscle gpb
with glc1p, in both the less active t-state and in
the active r-state, showed that the phosphate
group of glc1p did not contact the cofactor 50 phosphate group in the binary complex directly.9,10 in

isotope-exchange experiments, no significant isotope exchange in glc1p was observed with gpa in
the absence of glycogen, consistent with the view
that only in the ternary complex is glc1p aligned
correctly for catalysis.11 it was suggested that the
binding of oligosaccharide to the catalytic-site
channel was necessary in order to promote the
reactive conformation of glc1p in which there is a
direct contact between the substrate and cofactor
phosphate groups.12 in the complex between gpbt-state and a transition-state analogue, heptulose
2-phosphate (h2p), a direct hydrogen bond
between the h2p phosphate group and the
50 -phosphate group of plp was observed.13 the
presence of a methyl group in the b-position on
the c1 atom of the pyranose moiety in the h2p
inhibitor promotes a conformation of the h2p
phosphate group such that it contacts the plp
50 -phosphate group. the proximity of the two
negatively charged phosphate groups found in the
binary gpb/h2p complex is stabilized by an
arginine residue, arg569, which shifts from a site
buried in the protein characteristic of the t-state,
to a position where it can make contacts with the
substrate phosphate group.
here, we report the crystal structures of malp in
complex with glc1p, and with glc1p and oligosaccharide in order to understand the role of the
protein and the role of the oligosaccharide in promoting catalysis. the structure at 2.0 å resolution
of the malp/glc1p binary complex shows that the
380s loop, whose role is associated with the binding of maltodextrin substrate,8,14,15 is located in a
closed conformation suitable for the specific recognition of an oligosaccharide substrate. we used
these crystals of the binary malp/glc1p complex
as a starting point for studies of enzymatic catalysis in the solid state in order to follow the reaction
in the direction of oligosaccharide synthesis. oligo-

saccharide substrates maltotetraose (g4) and
maltopentaose (g5) were soaked into crystals of
the malp/glc1p complex. kinetic analysis in
solution has shown a rapid-equilibrium, random
bi – bi reaction in which the rate-limiting step is
the interconversion of the ternary enzyme/substrate complex.16 the x-ray structures presented
here show that catalysis had taken place in the
crystal within the time available for diffusion of
the large substrate into the protein crystal to yield
the product oligosaccharide and phosphate.

results and discussion
x-ray structure of the malp with bound glc1p
the structure of the malp with the substrate
glc1p bound in the catalytic site was determined
using monochromatic synchrotron radiation.
data to 2.0 å resolution were collected from the
co-crystals of malp/glc1p complex at 100 k at the
elettra synchrotron, trieste. the structure was
solved by molecular replacement using the native
malp structure as the search object. the statistics
for data collection and refinement are summarized
in table 1. the structure of malp/glc1p consists
of a homodimer of 796 residues per single chain,
each having a plp cofactor covalently linked to
the protein through the 1-amino group of lysine
680 (using the rabbit muscle gp numbering), a
glc1p substrate, a tris molecule (used as buffer)
and a total of 1235 water molecules. the final
model has a reasonable stereochemistry and all
non-gly residues fall within the allowed regions
of the ramachandran plot, except lys568
(f ¼ 1658; c ¼ 1748) and asp339 (f ¼ 618;
c ¼ 2 1678). these are key residues at the catalytic
site. lys568 contacts the 50 -phosphate group of the

plp cofactor. asp339 lines the oligosaccharide
channel and contacts the exogenous tris molecule.
the overall architecture of the protein is similar to
the previously determined malp structures.
figure 1(a) and (b) shows a ribbon diagram of
the dimeric structure of this a/b protein, viewed
normal to and along the pseudo 2-fold axis relating
two monomers. the quaternary structure, with c2
symmetry, is stabilized by intermolecular contacts
involving the central region known as the tower
helix. this region is important, because it mediates
the allosteric transition between the active r-state
and less active t-state in the mammalian gp

enzyme. figure 1(c) shows the structure of the
monomer and demonstrates the cleft between
the n-terminal and c-terminal domain that is the
binding site of the substrates and the plp cofactor.
figure 2(a) shows the electron density map in the
vicinity of the catalytic site of the malp/glc1p
complex. glc1p is firmly bound and exhibits low
thermal b-factors (table 1). a tris molecule is
located adjacent to the glc1p and hydrogen bonds
to the 1-phosphate group of glc1p.
the pyranose ring of glc1p is in the chair conformation (table 2) and occupies the sub-site 2 1,
using the nomenclature reported by watson et al.8

417

enzymatic catalysis in crystals of malp

the tris molecule occupies the next site, sub-site
þ 1. the position of the phosphate group relative
to the glucopyranose ring is similar to that
reported for complexes of glc1p with mammalian
gp. the torsion angle f (o5– c1 – o1 – p) is 1378
and may be compared with values of 1528 for
gpb-t-state/glc1p complex9 and 1298 for gpb-rstate/glc1p complex,10 and is close to the value of
1358 found in the calculated minimum energy conformation of glc1p in vacuo.9 in this conformation,
a hydrogen bond is formed between the phosphate
group and the o2 hydroxyl group. the glc1p substrate forms a large number of hydrogen bonds
with the enzyme but does not contact the co-factor
directly (figure 2(a)). the hydrogen bond between
 xxxg1457xxx  of his377 side-chain and the hydroxyl o6 of
the glc1p substrate is of interest because his377 is
the first residue of a mobile region designated as
the 380s loop (residues 377– 384). this loop in the
closed conformation folds over the catalytic site
and contributes to the recognition and correct
positioning of the oligosaccharide in the malp/
oligosaccharide complexes. in the malp native
structure5 and in the malp/acarbose complex,15
the loop adopts an open conformation (figure
3(a)). in the present binary complex, the 380s loop
adopts a close conformation similar to that
observed for the malp/oligosaccharide complexes,
although no oligosaccharide has been introduced
into the structure. sub-site þ 1 is occupied by a
tris molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with the
side-chains of asp339 and his341. thus the combination of glc1p at sub-site 2 1 and tris at sub-site
þ 1 has promoted a conformation that is typical of
the active conformation ready to accept an oligosaccharide substrate.
arg569 is a key residue at the catalytic site that
helps neutralize the close approach of the co-factor
50 -phosphate group to the substrate phosphate
group. in the malp/glc1p complex, the distance
between the two phosphorus atoms is 6.6 å and
the shortest o –o distance between the two phosphate groups is 4.3 å. the 50 -phosphate group of
the plp cofactor is stabilized by a lysine residue,
lys568. glc1p does not form a direct hydrogen
bond with the 50 -phosphate group of plp, although
there is an interaction through water of the glycosidic oxygen atom to the 50 -phosphate group. in
the inactive conformation of gpb in complex with
glc1p, arg569 is swung away from the glc1p phosphate group and access to the catalytic site is
blocked by the 280s loop, a loop of chain that connects the tower helix to helix 8 (figure 3(b)).
despite the fact that in the active malp the 280s
loop is folded so as to allow access to the catalytic
site and arg569 is in its productive conformation
ready to stabilize the close approach of the 50 -phosphate group of the cofactor and the substrate
phosphate group of glc1p, the two phosphate
groups do not approach each other sufficiently
closely to promote catalysis. a further incentive is
needed, in agreement with kinetic data, in order
to form a productive enzyme substrate. we

therefore investigated the addition of oligosaccharides to the malp/glc1p binary complex.
x-ray structures of the malp with the products
of enzymatic catalysis
crystals of the malp/glc1p binary complex were
soaked for 20 minutes with 100 mm solutions of
oligosaccharide substrates maltotetraose (g4) and
maltopentaose (g5). data were collected at 100 k
with a resolution limit of 1.8 å for substrate g4
and 2.2 å for substrate g5. the final r-factors
(rfree) are 0.186 (0.216) and 0.197 (0.243) for g4 and
g5, respectively (table 1). the overall architecture
of the protein in the oligosaccharide complexes is
very similar to that of the isomorphous malp/
glc1p structure. the electron density map at the
catalytic site of the binary complex soaked with
g4 shows the presence of phosphate, presumably
arising from dephosphorylation of glc1p. in the
catalytic channel, instead of the expected five
glucose units, which would be anticipated from
the reaction glc1p þ g4 ! po4 þ g5, only four
glucosidic monomers have been localized in the
sub-sites (þ 1, þ 2, þ 3 and þ 4). the most internal
sub-site 2 1 is occupied by five water molecules.

these solvent molecules, forming a hydrogen
bond network, are positioned in the sites previously occupied by the oxygen atoms of the glucosidic unit of glc1p (figure 2(b)). the sa-weighted
2fo 2 fc electron density map and the low thermal
factors for substrates (table 1) indicate that both
oligosaccharide and phosphate are bound with
high occupancy. the maltodextrin helix of the g4
oligosaccharide follows the catalytic tunnel and
emerges at the surface of the enzyme at sub-site
þ 4. the binding of oligosaccharide to malp is
dominated by stacking glucosyl/tyrosyl interactions at sub-sites þ 2 (tyr280) and þ 4 (tyr613)
and by hydrogen bonds of the peripheral hydroxyl
groups of sugar with the protein (figure 4). the
oligosaccharide adopts a structure that resembles
the minimum free energy conformation in which
the 2-hydroxyl group from one glucopyranose
ring forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with
the 3-hydroxyl group of the adjacent glucopyranose. the phosphate group forms hydrogen bonds
with both 50 -phosphate groups of the plp cofactor
and with o4 of the glucose unit located in sub-site
þ 1 (figure 2(b)). it contacts the side-chains of
arg569, tyr573 and lys574, the main-chain n of
gly135, and leu136 and four water molecules.

figure 5. superimposition of the substrates glc1p,
malp/glc1p soaked in g4 and malp/glc1p soaked in
g5 at the catalytic site of the three structures.

the electron density maps at the catalytic site of
the structure resulting from the soaking of the
malp/glc1p complex with g5 show a phosphate
anion and five oligosaccharide moieties bound
across the catalytic site starting from the first 2 1
site (figure 2(c)). however, the phosphate anion is
not well defined (overall b-factor of 61 å2). a similar disorder of the anion substrate was observed in
the structure of ternary complexes malp/gsg4/p,
where the overall b-factor was 60 å2,8 and in a
malp/g5/so4, where the overall b-factor was
55 å2 (unpublished results). in contrast, the phosphate group in the native malp structure (overall
b-factor 34 å2)5 and in the structure obtained by
soaking malp/glc1p with g4 (overall b-factor
20 å2) is very well defined. the disorder of the
phosphate anion found in the malp/gsg4/p
structure was explained as a result of its proximity
to the “unnatural” thio linkage of the
oligosaccharide.8 the present results show that a
phosphate anion does not fit comfortably in this
site when a natural substrate occupies sub-site
2 1. no significant movement of the protein residues in the catalytic site after enzymatic reaction
was observed, with the exception of the small
shift in arg569 that follows the shift of the phosphate group from glc1p to inorganic phosphate
(p– p distance 1.8 å) (figure 5). this shift provides
additional support for the presence of the phosphate group in the ternary complex. in the present
structures, the torsion angles about the glycosidic
bonds between the sugar residues in sub-sites þ 1,
þ 2, þ 3 and þ 4 are similar to those observed in
the previously reported oligosaccharide malp
complexes,8 in which there are o2/o30 intramolecular hydrogen bonds. the torsion angles
about the glycosidic linkage between the sugar

419

residues in sub-sites 2 1 and þ 1 exhibit a nonstandard geometry that is necessary in order to
allow the sugar to bind in sub-site 2 1. there is
rotation of about 2 608 around the o40 – c40 torsion
angle, c, and a rotation of about 2 308 around the
c1 – o40 torsion angle, f, that breaks the intramolecular o20 /o30 hydrogen bond between the
first two glucosidic units. the conformation is
similar to that observed previously in the g5 and
the gsg4/p complexes.8
the presence of phosphate at the catalytic site in
both these oligosaccharide soak experiments indicates that catalysis has taken place. it is surprising,
therefore, that we do not observe elongation of the
oligosaccharide (g4 to g5 or g5 to g6). the extra
sugar molecule would be expected in an additional
sub-site þ 5. this sub-site is on the surface of the
enzyme where there are few opportunities to
make strong interactions with the protein. in support of the likely existence of a disordered sugar
residue in sub-site þ 5, we note that the electron
density maps indicate that the configuration of the
reducing sugar in sub-site þ 4 is in the a configuration and not the expected b configuration, which
is the more favored configuration for a terminal
glucose residue (figure 6). from this result, we
suggest that this hydroxyl group is not the reducing end of the oligosaccharide chain but there is at
least another a-1,4 glycosidic link.
these experiments show that the relatively large
oligosaccharide substrates (g4, 666 da; g5,
829 da) can diffuse into the crystals and that the
enzymatic reaction can go almost to completion,
as evidenced by the disappearance of glc1p and
formation of phosphate, without significant crystal
damage. furthermore, the structures demonstrate
that the malto-oligosaccharide can bind in two
different modes. in one mode, which is observed
in the experiment with g5, the non-reducing

terminal glucosyl residue is bound in sub-site 2 1
in a position suitable for phosphorolysis. in the
other mode, which is observed in the experiment
with g4, the terminal residue is bound in sub-site
þ 1 in a position that allows it to act a glucosyl
acceptor during synthesis. the differences in oligosaccharide positions observed in the two experiments are intriguing but may be explained by the
following observations. the presence of phosphate
at the catalytic site results in a tension with the
sugar in sub-site 2 1. this is seen by the very
short hydrogen bond distance between the phosphate group and the oxygen atom of the glycosidic
bond (2.2 å) in the malp/glc1p complex soaked
with g5. this tension and the energy required to
achieve the unusual glycosidic torsion angles
between the sugar residues in sub-sites 2 1 and
þ 1 can be compensated by the interactions of the
oligosaccharide with the enzyme. the interactions
made in sub-site þ 4, where there is stacking
between the sugar residue and the conserved
tyr613, make significant contributions. model
building suggests that a sugar residue with an a
configuration is preferred in this site. the hydrophobic c –h group of the a anomeric carbon atom
faces the phenolic ring, and this configuration
allows a stronger ch/p interaction of the sugar
residue with the tyrosine residue than a b configuration (figure 6). the electron density maps indicate
that the incubation of malp/glc1p with g4 and g5
has resulted in g5 and g6 oligosaccharides,
respectively, but that the reducing terminal oligosaccharide is not located in the density and does
not make contact with the enzyme. this interpretation places an a sugar residue in sub-site þ 4 in
both experiments. however, were the incubation
of g4 with malp/glc1p to have placed g5 in subsites 2 1, þ 1 to þ 4 then a b sugar residue would
be placed in sub-site þ 4 and would be less favorable in compensating the conflict between the
phosphate group and the sugar residue at sub-site
2 1. hence, in this experiment, sub-site 2 1 is not
occupied and the oligosaccharide occupies subsites þ 1 to þ 5 with an a sugar residue in sub-site
þ 4 and the sugar residue in sub-site þ 5 not
localized.

enzymatic catalysis in crystals of malp

catalytic mechanism
the gp and malp enzymes have been the subject
of intense biochemical and crystallographic
studies.8,9,12,13,17 these data led to the proposal of a
two-step mechanism for the catalysis of the glycogenolysis process.8,12,13 in the first step, the 50 -phosphate group of the plp cofactor promotes a
general acid attack by the inorganic phosphate on
the glycosidic oxygen atom, leading to cleavage of
the glycosidic c1 –o bond and formation of a
carbonium/oxonium ion transition state. in the
second step, nucleophilic attack by the inorganic
phosphate on the carbonium/oxonium ion leads
to formation of the product glc1p with retention
of configuration. in the reverse reaction (figure 7),
lengthening of the oligosaccharide by addition of
the glucosyl moiety of glc1p to the non-reducing
end of the maltodextrin chain with concomitant
production of phosphate, the first step is a proton
transfer from the 50 -phosphate group of plp to the
phosphate group of glc1p that promotes the
cleavage of the c1 – o bond and formation of a carbonium/oxonium ion transition state. the reaction
is completed by the attack of the o4 hydroxyl
group of the incoming oligosaccharide on the carbonium/oxonium ion intermediate, which is
assisted by the plp 50 -phosphate group acting
through the inorganic phosphate. the present
results show that in the absence of oligosaccharide,
glc1p does not alter the conformation of its linkage
between the glucose residue and its phosphate
group from that observed in the minimum free
energy structure in order to contact the 50 -phosphate group of the plp. however, in the presence
of oligosaccharide, catalysis takes place and the
resulting product, inorganic phosphate, does
contact the 50 -phosphate group.
the structures obtained after enzymatic catalysis
in the crystal reveal the relative positions of
substrates in the catalytic channel. figure 5 demonstrates the difference between the phosphate group
of glc1p observed in the malp/glc1p complex and
free phosphate observed in the oligosaccharide
complexes. in order to stabilize the reaction
product, the arg569 side-chain follows the phosphate anion. figure 5 illustrates the ease with
which the phosphate group of glc1p can approach
the 50 -phosphate group of plp by a rotation about
the c1 – o bond encouraged by the sugar residue
in sub-site þ 1. the relative position of the glc1p
and the oligosaccharide obtained from g4 is consistent with a nucleophilic attack from the o4
hydroxyl oxygen atom of the non-reducing end of
maltodextrin on the c1 carbon atom of the glucosidic unit of glc1p (the o4 – c1 distance is 2.1 å).
however, this direct attack is hampered by the
proximity of the phosphate-leaving group (the
o4 – p distance is 1.8 å; the o4 –o1p distance is
1.7 å). this suggests that the phosphate group
should leave the c1 carbon atom, with the formation of a carbonium/oxonium ion transition
state, before the nucleophilic attack of the oligo-

saccharide and that the sugar interacting with the
phosphate groups of glc1p acts as “primer” for
the dephosphorolysis reaction of glc1p. for the formation of the elongated oligosaccharide, only a
small adjustment of the orientation of the glucosidic group in the sub-site 2 1 and a small shift of
the other glucosidic units is necessary in order to
make the new glycosidic bond with retention of
configuration (figure 5). x-ray crystallographic
studies cannot prove the existence of an unstable
intermediate. the three-dimensional structures
presented here represent thermodynamically stable
structures obtained in several steps of the
enzymatic pathway. they have allowed us to draft
a molecular movie† on the basis of experimental
data that gives an idea of how the enzyme works.

materials and methods
malp expression and purification
malp was obtained from the expression strain e. coli
dmala518 harboring the plasmid pmap101 and purified
as described.18,19
crystallization
crystals of the binary complex malp/glc1p were
obtained by co-crystallization experiments using the
hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. single crystals
of the complex grew from drops containing 2.0 ml of a
6.0 mg/ml protein solution, 0.4 ml of 100 mm glc1p
(sigma aldrich) solution and 1.6 ml of well solution
(27% (w/v) peg 4000, 0.1 m licl, 0.1 m tris, ph 8.5 at
291 k). optimized crystallization trials produced
rectangular plate-like crystals in four to five days with
typical dimensions of about 1000 mm £ 200 mm £ 10 mm.
the crystals were extremely fragile and sensitive to
slight changes in temperature and mother liquor, and
decomposed quickly even with gentle manipulation.
crystals were harvested into mother liquor containing
15% (v/v) methyl-2,4-pentanediol (mpd) as cryoprotectant with a small loop of fine rayon fiber and flash-frozen
in a stream of n2 at 100 k prior to data collection. a
further crystal form was obtained in the presence of
higher concentrations of peg 4000 (30%, w/v) and
0.5 m licl. this second crystal form had a prismatic
morphology with typical dimensions of about
300 mm £ 300 mm £ 50 mm.
enzymatic reaction in the crystal
two different substrates, maltotetraose (g4) and
maltopentaose (g5) (sigma aldrich) were used for the
enzymatic catalysis in crystals of the binary complex
malp/glc1p. the enzymatic reaction in the crystal was
performed by soaking a solution (2 ml) obtained by mixing equal volumes of substrate solution (100 mm g4 or
100 mm g5) and the well solution was added to the
drop (about 2 ml) where the crystals of malp/glc1p had
grown. this drop contained a large excess of glc1p
(about 20 mm). after 20 minutes of soaking time, the
crystals were passed quickly through a solution of
† http://www.units.it/ceb/malp_movie.html

422

mother liquor containing 15% cryoprotectant mpd and
15 mm substrates glc1p and g4 or g5 and flash-frozen
at 100 k prior to data collection.
x-ray data collection and processing
x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the
elettra synchrotron light source, trieste, italy. a complete data set to 2.0 å of resolution was collected using
a monochromatic radiation with wavelength of 1.000 å
and a mar research 345 mm imaging plate detector
from a single crystal of the binary complex malp/glc1p.
a crystal of malp/glc1p soaked with g5 substrate was
used for the collection of data to 2.2 å resolution using
a wavelength of 1.200 å with the mar 345 image plate
detector. a data set at 1.8 å resolution from a crystal
malp/glc1p soaked with g4 was collected using a wavelength of 1.200 å and an marccd area detector.
the crystals of the binary complex malp/glc1p
belong to the space group p212121 with unit-cell dimensions a ¼ 74.83 å, b ¼ 105.28 å and c ¼ 218.62 å. this
crystal form is similar to that obtained for the malp/g5,
malp/gsg4 and malp/acarbose complex crystals
grown under similar conditions.8,15 data were processed
using mosflm and scala from the ccp4 program
suite.20,21 a summary of data collection procedures and
crystallographic statistics for the binary malp/glc1p
complex and for the two crystals of malp/glc1p soaked
with g4 and g5, respectively, is given in table 1. the
crystals of the second form diffracted poorly (3.0 å resolution) and were found to correspond to a c2 cell similar
to the previously reported malp/maltose complex.14
structure determination
the structure of malp/glc1p was solved with
refmac22 using as starting coordinates the isomorphous structure of malp/gsg4 complex with substrates removed. a random subset of data (5%) was
omitted from all refinement calculations to provide an
assessment of the progress of refinement. rigid-body
refinement of the two polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit gave an r-factor of 0.31. the glc1p substrate
was then easily located in an initial difference fourier
electron density map. the model was further refined
using refmac. the ncs restraints were strong for the
two crystallographically independent protein molecules
and for the water molecules related by pseudo
symmetry. the ncs restraints for specific amino acid
side-chains were released when large differences in conformation between the two independent units were
detected in the fourier maps. restrained positional and
thermal factor refinement with non-crystallographic
symmetry restraints improved the r-factor and rfree to
0.265 and 0.298, respectively. a subsequent difference
fourier map clearly revealed the presence of a tris
molecule near the glc1p substrate in the catalytic site.
rebuilding of the model and location of solvent atoms
were based on the analysis of sa-weighted23 (2fo 2 fc)
and (fo 2 fc) maps and were performed on silicon
graphics workstations using the program o.24 the final
r-factor and rfree are 0.180 and 0.220, respectively.
a similar refinement strategy for the complexes
obtained by soaking the malp/glc1p crystals in g4 and
g5 led to final r-factor (rfree) values of 0.186 (0.216) and
0.197 (0.243), respectively. the high quality of the electron density maps, especially that obtained from the
1.8 å resolution map with the ternary complex with g4,

enzymatic catalysis in crystals of malp

indicated a different assignment of three contiguous
amino acid residues in the primary sequence. the
sequence changes involve residues 261– 263 (e. coli
numbering scheme) located in the important 280s loop.
these sequence changes were not observed in the
previous malp structures and differ from the primary
sequence reported in sequence databases. the assignment (with the previous assignment in brackets) is
ala261 (his), phe262 (tyr), glu263 (ala). in rabbit
muscle gp, the corresponding residues are phe285,
phe286 and glu287. two of the three residues are conserved in the two isoenzymes, while the important
phe285 residue, that with tyr613 forms the nucleosideinhibitor site in gp, is replaced by ala and not by an
aromatic his residue. the model quality was checked
with procheck.25
protein data bank accession numbers
atomic coordinates and structure factors of malp/
glc1p binary complex (1l5v) and of ternary complexes
obtained from malp/glc1p crystals soaked with g4
(1l5w) and with g5 (1l6i) have been deposited in the
rcsb protein data bank.
