physical inactivity is a risk factor for numerous chronic diseases. low compliance with interventions to increase activity suggests
involvement of biological systems.
objective: to examine whether sequence variants in genes encoding neuropeptides and receptors in the arcuate and
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus contribute to variations in physical activity level in the québec family study.
methods: we genotyped polymorphisms in the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r), melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r),
neuropeptide-y (npy), neuropeptide-y y1 receptor (npy y1r), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart), agoutirelated protein (agrp), and  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) genes in 669 subjects (age (x7s.d.): parents: 5273.4 y; offspring:
2878.7 y). total physical activity, moderate-to-strenuous activity, and inactivity phenotypes were estimated from a three-day
record. the past year’s physical activity level was assessed from a questionnaire. associations between the physical activity
phenotypes and the polymorphisms were analyzed using the mixed model (sas).
results: the mc4r-c-2745t variant showed significant associations with physical activity phenotypes. the lowest moderateto-strenuous activity scores (p ¼ 0.005) and the highest inactivity scores (p ¼ 0.01) emerged in the t/t genotype. exclusion of
obese subjects increased the association. for inactivity, the association of the mc4r-c-2745t variant was strongest in the
offspring (p ¼ 0.002). the t/t offspring had both the highest inactivity score and the lowest body mass index. the carta1475g variant modified the associations with mc4r-c-2745t; t/t homozygotes had the lowest activity scores when they also
had the a/a cart-a1475g genotype. no significant associations were observed with polymorphisms in the other
neuropeptides.
conclusion: these findings suggest that dna sequence variation at the mc4r gene locus may contribute to the propensity
to be sedentary.

introduction
numerous epidemiological and intervention studies have
provided evidence of the beneficial effects of physical
activity on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine
systems.1 despite the fact that exercise is known to be
healthful and despite the efforts to promote physical activity
in the population, more than 60% of american adults are
not regularly active and 25% are sedentary.2 physical activity
interventions can result in increased physical activity level,

but the behavioral change is typically small and short-lived.3
the low compliance to interventions suggests that biological
systems may be involved in the tendency to be and to
remain physically inactive.
most research on the causes of low compliance have
focused on environmental and social influences, which are
probably the most important determinants. however, the
potential for physical activity to be controlled by intrinsic
biological processes has been largely overlooked. twin and
family studies have shown that, besides environment,
genetic factors also contribute to the level of physical
activity. a review on the genetic determinants of physical
activity in twin and family studies reported heritability
coefficients between 0.29 and 0.62 for daily physical activity,
suggesting significant, albeit variable, genetic effects.4 for
the first phase of the québec family study (qfs), we found

mc4r gene and physical activity
rjf loos et al

421
that genetic factors accounted for 29% of the variance
of habitual physical activity.5 this is in line with the
maximal heritabilities we reported recently for different
types of physical activity phenotypes, ranging between
0.16 and 0.25.6
further support for the concept of a role of biological
systems comes from the fact that spontaneous physical
activity can be subconsciously modulated to maintain
body weight. for instance, leibel et al7 have shown that a
10% increase in body weight caused by overfeeding is
associated with an 8–9% increase in nonresting energy
expenditure in both lean and obese subjects. similar results
were obtained by levine et al,8 who overfed nonobese
subjects an extra 1000 kcal/day for 8 weeks. two-thirds
of the increase in total daily energy expenditure was
due to increased nonexercise activity thermogenesis, such
as fidgeting, maintenance of posture, and other physical
activities of daily life. in a long-term overfeeding experiment, 12 pairs of young male identical twins ate 4.18 mj/day
energy surplus, 6 days a week, during a period of 100 days.9
significant increases in body weight and fat mass were
observed. data showed considerable interindividual differences in the adaptation to excess energy and that the
variation observed was not randomly distributed, as indicated by the significant within-pair resemblance in response.
on average, 63% of the extra energy consumed was
accounted for by the changes in fat mass and fat-free mass.
part of the remaining 37% energy must in all likelihood be
associated with increases in resting metabolic rate, thermic
effect of food, standard postures, moving the body around,
and fidgeting.10
results from early animal studies following experimentally induced lesions in the central nervous system
suggest that central control centers might regulate daily
energy expenditure through physical activity. lesions in
different parts of the basal forebrain have different effects
on activity; lesions in the vertical diagonal band nucleus
and posterior nucleus basalis magnocellularis produce
hyperactivity, whereas lesions in the anterior nucleus
basalis magnocellularis cause hypoactivity.11 lesions in
the ventromedial hypothalamus, but not in the paraventricular nucleus, caused a decrease in physical activity
in rats.12 besides the anatomical evidence for a role of
the nervous system, it has also been established that
dopamine and its receptor can affect ambulatory activity
in mice.13
animal studies have provided strong evidence for a
role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of energy
homeostasis. studies with knockout and transgenic mice
have suggested that the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r)
and the melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r) might be
involved in the regulation of spontaneous and stimulusinduced activity.14 ste marie et al14 found that the locomotor
activity of young male nonobese mc4r knockout mice
was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice.
when normal mice were switched from a low-fat to

a moderate-fat diet, they responded with an increased
activity. however, butler et al15 found no change in
physical activity in young mc4r knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. mc3r knockout mice have been
studied by butler et al16 and chen et al.17 while not
overweight, these mice exhibited an increased fat mass
and a significant reduction in locomotor activity.
finally, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript
(cart) peptides have been associated with an increased
locomotor activity in the rat after intraventral tegmental
area administration.18
in this study, we tested whether sequence variants in genes
coding for neuropeptides and receptors of the arcuate and
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and variants in
genes coding for molecules in downstream pathways contribute to variation in physical activity level in the qfs
cohort.

methods
subjects
the qfs cohort has been described previously.19 in the
present study, based on phase 2 of the qfs project, 669
individuals from 200 french-canadian families living in and
around the greater québec city area are included. informed
written consent was obtained from all subjects and the qfs
project had been approved by the medical ethics committee
of laval university.

physical activity phenotype
in a 3-day activity diary, which included one weekend day,
the subjects recorded their dominant activity every 15-min
period of the day. each activity was categorized into one of
nine activity classes, ordered by increasing energy expenditure level (based on the metabolic equivalent met), and was
scored accordingly from 1 to 9, with 1 being asleep and 9
performing high-intensity activities. the ‘total daily activity
level’ is defined as the sum of all activity scores over 3 days
and was composed of two components: the ‘inactivity’
component and the ‘moderate-to-strenuous physical activity’ component. the subjects’ ‘inactivity’ level is represented
by the sum of activities from class 1 to 4 (including activities
such as sleeping, eating, watching tv, washing oneself,
cooking) and the sum of activities from class 5 to 9 defines
their ‘moderate-to-strenuous physical activity’ level. the
intraclass correlation for test–retest reliability of the 3-day
activity diary, studied among 61 subjects, reached 0.96.20
the ‘inactivity’ and ‘moderate-to-strenuous physical activity’
components correlate negatively (pearson’s correlation
r ¼ 0.53, po0.0001).
in addition to the 3-day activity diary, the subjects
reported the average time spent (h/week) on physical activity
during the past year.
body mass index (bmi) was calculated as body weight (kg)
divided by squared height (m2).

molecular analysis
genomic dna was prepared from permanent lymphoblastoid cells through the proteinase k and phenol/chloroform
technique. dna was dialyzed four times against te buffer
(10 mm tris, 1 mm edta, ph 8.0) for 6 h at 41c, and ethanol
was precipitated. dna (5 mg) was digested either with psti for
neuropeptide-y y1 receptor (npy y1r) or with hindiii for
neuropeptide-y (npy) according to the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (new england biolabs, beverly,
ma, usa). the fragments were separated on a 1.2% agarose
gel by electrophoresis and transferred by alkali blotting on
nylon membrane (hybondn þ , amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj, usa). the hindiii filters were hybridized with human npy cdna probe (npy3–75, courtesy of
carolyn worby, phd) labeled with [a-32p]dctp (nen dupont
boston, ma, usa) by random priming (t7 quickprime kit,
amersham pharmacia biotech) to a specific activity of
z1  109 cpm/mg. the psti filters were hybridized with a
human npy y1r cdna probe isolated from human cdna by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the labeling conditions
were the same as for npy. the hybridization was carried out
in a hybridization oven (robbins scientific corp., sunnyvale,
ca, usa) at 651c for 18 h and an autoradiography was
performed using kodak xar-5 films with intensifying
screens for 3–5 days at 701c. the size of the fragments
was estimated using ldna digested with ecor1 and hindiii
as standards. the pcr conditions for typing restriction
fragment polymorphisms in mc4r (mc4r-c-2745t (dbsnp
database: rs7242169), mc4r-val103ile (dbsnp database:
2229616))21,22 and mc3r (mc3r-pst1)23 have been described elsewhere. to identify the exact location of the
mc4r-c-2745t polymorphism, we screened the mc4r
coding region along with 3500 bp of the 50 flanking region
in 16 subjects with known genotype. the initial screening
was performed by designing primer sets to amplify approximately 500 bp segments and digesting the pcr products with
ncoi. the polymorphic ncoi site was identified in a pcr
product spanning from 2696 to 3275 bp upstream of the
mc4r start codon (forward primer 50 -ggc att tct cca
aag att at-30 and reverse primer 50 -cac cgc acc ttg
cta at-30 ). direct sequencing of the pcr product revealed
that the ncoi site was induced by a c4t transition in
nucleotide 2745 of the mc4r promoter region. algorithm
prediction of this region with alibaba2.124 and tess
(transcription element search system)25 predicts that this
c-2745t transition could potentially affect the binding of
transcription factors to this site. compared to the c-allele, a
t-allele could result in additional binding sites for yy1dfactor, c/ebpa and c/ebpb.
the  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) (pomc c5437t
(dbsnp database: rs934778)) and agouti-related protein
(agrp) (agrp a67t (dbsnp database: rs5030980)) polymorphisms were genotyped using the taqman assay. the
dna fragment containing the snp was amplified using
flanking pcr primers. the reaction mix also included two
allele-specific fluorogenic probes labeled with different
international journal of obesity

fluorescent reporter dyes at the 50 end (fam and tamra)
and a quencher dye at the 30 end ( xxxd1430xxx -1 and  xxxd1430xxx -2). in an
intact probe, the proximity of the quencher dye reduced the
fluorescence signal from the reporter dye. during pcr
amplification, the 50 exonuclease activity of taq dna
polymerase cleaved the probe only when it matched exactly
the amplified dna sequence. the released reporter dye
produced an increase in fluorescence signal, which
was measured directly in the pcr plates using a fluostar
galaxy plate reader (bmg labtechnologies, durham, nc,
usa). fluorescence values were then converted to scatter
plots to generate four distinct clusters of data points (one
cluster for negative controls, one for each of the two
homozygous genotypes, and one for the heterozygous
genotype).
to detect the cart 1457a/dela variants, four primers were
used. the two forward primers were designed from the same
strand of dna without or with the deletion of a at position
1457 (f1: 50 -ggc gtc cat tct cct cca-30 and f2: 50 -ggc
gtc cat tct cct cct-30 ). the reverse primers derived
from the complementary strand (r1: 50 -tat tct tca cac
agt aac atc-30 and r2: 50 -ctt cac aca cgt atc aac
ac-30 ) were tailed with a universal m13 sequence recognized
by m13 infrared-tagged primers (700 or 800 ird; li-cor, ne,
usa). pcr reactions and genotyping have been described in
detail elsewhere.26 briefly, pcr was performed in 10 ml
reaction volumes. samples were amplified using a perkinelmer thermal cycler. automated infrared dna sequencers
(li-cor) were used to detect the pcr products. the a/a, del
a/del a genotypes were identified by bands 230, 197 and
230/197 bp, respectively. the results were subsequently
confirmed by sequencing.
a minisequencing assay was used to detect the carta1475g variants. genomic dna (20 ng) was added to a
mixture containing a final concentration of: (1) dntp
(amersham pharmacia biotech inc.), 30 mm each; (2) taq
dna polymerase (quiagen), 0.3 u; (3) buffer 1  (10  : trishcl, kcl, (nh4o2so4 and 15 mm mgcl2; ph 8.7 (201c)); (4)
flanking primers, 50 nm each; forward 50 -ggc gtc cat tct
cct cca-30 , reverse 50 -tat tct tca cac agt aac atc-3;
(5) and mgcl2, 2 mm. following a 5 min denaturation step at
941c, 38 pcr amplification cycles were performed as follows:
denaturation at 941c, 20 s, annealing at 571c, 1 min, for 10
cycles, and denaturation at 951c, 20 s, annealing at 521c,
1 min, extension at 721c, 10 s, for 28 cycles. in the same well,
the pcr mixture dntps were digested with 0.2 u of shrimp
alkaline phosphatase (usb) (final volume: 11 ml) for 15 min
at 371c followed by 20 min at 801c. minisequencing assay
was performed in a final volume of 16 ml (same well): (1)
 xxxd1837xxx ,  xxxd22xxx , ddctp, and ddttp (amersham pharmacia
biotech inc.), 1.56 mm each; (2) irdye tag primers, 3.125 nm
(licor); 50 -ata cat ccc cat ccc tct-30 ; (3) thermosequenase (amersham pharmacia biotech inc.), 0.3 u; (4)
0.6  buffer (10  : tris-hcl, 260 mm; mgcl2, 65 mm; ph

detection was carried out on a licor automated sequencer
model 4200.
we have chosen these polymorphisms because (1) they are
exonic, result in amino-acid substitutions, or are located in
putative 50 or 30 utr/regulatory regions of the gene and thus
may have functional implications (mc4r-val103ile, mc4rc-2745t, agrp ala67thr); (2) they have been associated
with obesity-related phenotypes (mc4r-c-2745t, agrp
ala67thr, mc3r-pst1), and can therefore be considered as
candidate genes for physical activity level; and (3) they were
known to be polymorphic in caucasians (pomc c5437t,
npy 6.8/4.6 kb, npy y1r 5.1/3.8 kb), whereas for many other
snps in dbsnp, no information on heterozygosity or linkage
disequilibrium is available.

the phenotypic characteristics of the 669 subjects are
shown in table 1. the total physical activity score was
significantly (po0.0001) higher for men compared to
women as a result of a higher score (po0.001) for
moderate-to-strenuous physical activities. the physical
inactivity score was not different (p ¼ 0.14) between
sexes. no differences were observed between fathers and
sons, whereas daughters had a significantly lower total
physical activity score (p ¼ 0.04) relative to the mothers,
mainly due to a lower score for moderate-to-strenuous
physical activities (p ¼ 0.03). only in the mothers, a
significant although low correlation was observed
between bmi and the total physical activity score
(r ¼ 0.17, p ¼ 0.03) and moderate-to-strenuous physical
activities (r ¼ 0.15, p ¼ 0.049). the past year’s physical
activity level was not different between parent and offspring,
or between men and women.
the allele and genotype frequencies for the nine
polymorphisms in seven candidate genes considered
here are presented in table 2. the genotypic distributions
of all but one polymorphism were in agreement
(p40.05) with those expected under hardy–weinberg
equilibrium.
only the mc4r-c-2745t polymorphism showed significant associations with the physical activity scores, in
particular with moderate-to-strenuous physical activity and
inactivity phenotypes (table 3). homozygotes for the t-allele
had a significantly lower score for moderate-to-strenuous
physical activity level, which was paralleled by a higher
inactivity score compared to the c/c homozygotes. when
only nonobese subjects (bmi o30 kg/m2) were considered,
the associations were even more pronounced, whereas no
significant associations were observed in the obese subjects.
the bmi (o30 vs z30 kg/m2)-by-gene interaction term,
however, did not reach significance (p ¼ 0.19 for total
physical activity, p ¼ 0.10 for moderate-to-strenuous physical
activity, and p ¼ 0.15 for inactivity). the past year’s physical
activity level followed the trend of the 3-day diary recording
with t/t homozygotes spending on average 1 h/week less on
physical activity compared to the other genotypes. this
trend was observed in both obese and nonobese subjects.
overall, bmi was not significantly associated with the
mc4r-c-2745t polymorphism.

statistical analyses
all the analyses were performed with the sas statistical
software (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa). a w2 likelihood
ratio test was performed to assess whether the observed
genotype frequencies were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium.
the physical activity phenotypes were adjusted for age,
sex, and bmi by a stepwise regression procedure, performed
separately in six age-by-sex groups (o30, 30–50, 450 y). in
the same way, bmi was adjusted for age and sex. for
estimation of the regression parameters, subjects with
phenotypic values below or above 3 s.d. of the group mean
were identified and temporarily excluded. however, for
calculation of the adjusted scores, these outliers were added
to the sample again.
associations between the gene markers and the phenotypes were analyzed using the mixed model procedure.
nonindependence among family members was adjusted for
by using a ‘sandwich estimator’, which asymptotically yields
the same parameter estimates as ordinary least squares or
regression methods, but the standard errors and resulting
hypothesis tests are adjusted for the dependencies. the
method is general, assuming the same degree of dependency
among all members within a family. possible gene-by-gene,
sex-by-gene, bmi (o30 vs z30 kg/m2)-by-gene, and generation-by-gene interactions were tested with the mixed model
procedure by including main effects and interaction terms in
the same model.

for the inactivity phenotype, a significant interaction was
found between mc4r-c-2745t and generation (p ¼ 0.036)
(table 4). in the offspring, mc4r-c-2745t was associated
with inactivity, with the t/t homozygotes having a higher
inactivity score compared to subjects with the c/t or c/c

discussion
our data show that the c-2745t variant of the mc4r
gene is associated with physical activity level. homozygotes for the rare t-allele scored less for moderate-tostrenuous physical activity, were more inactive, and
reported 1 h/week less physical activity during the past
year. in the offspring, these homozygotes had a lower
bmi despite a higher inactivity score. in parents, however,
no association between mc4r-c-2745t and inactivity
level or bmi was observed. in addition, our results suggest
that the cart-a1475g variant modifies the effect of
the mc4r-c-2745t polymorphism; t/t mc4r-c-2745t
homozygotes had the lowest moderate-to-strenuous
physical activity score when they were also a/a homozygotes for the cart-a1475g variant, whereas they had the

highest score when they carried the g-allele of the carta1475g variant.
mc4r is widely expressed throughout the brain and spinal
cord and plays a key role in the regulation of feeding
behavior and energy homeostasis.15,27 in general, stimulated
mc4r signaling will lead to a decreased food intake and an
increased metabolic rate, while antagonists of this receptor
have the opposite effect.27 mc4r-knockout mice become
hyperphagic, and have a reduced metabolic rate.28 in
humans, the importance of the mc4r gene in the regulation
of human body weight became apparent in 1998 when the
first mutations in the human mc4r gene were described in
some patients with childhood obesity.29,30 two groups
reported heterozygous frameshift mutations that cosegregated in a dominant fashion with severe early-onset obesity.
subsequently, more than 30 different mutations, including
missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, in the mc4r
gene have been reported in french, english, german,
american, italian, and spanish individuals.31–43 functional
studies showed that many of the missense mutations, and all
three frameshift mutations described so far, led to a complete
or partial loss of function of the mc4r gene.31,33,40,42,44,45 in
a recent study, farooqi et al42 found that the signaling
properties of mutant mc4r receptors, as determined in cell
international journal of obesity

426
cultures, correlated with the severity of obesity. however,
not all patients with mutations are obese, which suggests
that haploinsufficiency mutations in the mc4r gene may
at times cause obesity but with variable expression or
penetrance.34
to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show
an association between a dna sequence variation in the
mc4r gene and physical activity in humans. the findings in
animal studies provide some support for our results. when
switched from a low-fat to a moderate-fat diet, normal mice
responded with an appropriate decrease in food intake, and
increases in thermogenesis and locomotor activity. young
mc4r-knockout mice, however, failed to show changes in
thermogenesis or locomotor activity and exhibited a significant increase in weight that could not be attributed to
hyperphagia alone.15 thus a functional mc4r seems to be
needed for acute regulation of activity-based energy expenditure in response to changes in diet. ste marie et al14 studied
the contribution of mc4r to metabolism in the absence of
hyperphagia by pair-feeding (pf) mc4r-knockout mice and
wild-type mice. pf mc4r-null males showed less locomotor
activity, but did not gain weight, although they had
significantly more body fat than the wild-type controls.
locomotor activity of female pf mc4r-null mice, however,
was not reduced but they did gain more weight. the data
suggested that mc4r deficiency may enhance the metabolic
efficiency.14 in a pharmacological study, adage et al46
performed a pf study to evaluate the food intake-independent mechanisms of the melanocortin system in the
development of obesity. administration of the melanocortin
receptor antagonist shu9119 to rats reduced spontaneous
locomotor activity and body temperature. they were only
slightly heavier, but had significantly more fat mass
compared to vehicle control animals.46
interestingly, these three studies14,15,46 found the effect of
mc4r on locomotor activity in nonobese animals. in the
present study, the associations of the mc4r-c-2745t variant
with physical activity traits were only seen in the nonobese.
the absence of an association in the obese may reflect lower
statistical power due to a smaller sample size or may be due
to obesity itself.47 physical and psychological factors related
to obesity may cause obese subjects to refrain from physical
activity, and these factors may override genotypic and
biological drive.
for the inactivity phenotype, we found associations with
the mc4r-c-2745t variant in offspring but not in parents.
interestingly, t/t homozygotes not only had a higher
inactivity score, but they were also leaner than the carriers
of the c-allele. this is in contrast not only with the
observations of many epidemiological studies,48 but also
with the findings of ste marie et al14 and adage et al46 who
reported a significantly higher percentage body fat when the
mouse mc4r was knocked out or antagonized. on the other
hand, in parents, we did not observe an association with the
inactivity score, although there was a tendency for the t/t
homozygotes to have a higher bmi. these results suggest
international journal of obesity

that perhaps the inactivity of the younger t/t homozygotes
has its effect on body mass only later in life, as the t/t
parental bmi was not different or was even slightly higher
compared to the other genotypes. however, this issue cannot
be resolved with the present cross-sectional study.
no associations were found with the mc4r-val103ile
polymorphism, which showed no linkage disequilibrium
with the mc4r-c-2745t variant (d2 for linkage disequilibrium ¼ 0.07).
another candidate gene for physical activity level is cart.
cart peptides are expressed in many areas of the brain and
are coexpressed with pomc in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus. animal studies suggest that cart might play
a role in feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis.49
kimmel et al18 found that certain cart peptides induce
locomotor activity in rat. in the present study, we did not
observe an association between either of the two cart
variants and physical activity. however, the cart-a1475g
variant seemed to modify the association of the mc4r-c2745t variant with physical activity. the a/a homozygotes
of cart-a1475g defined a subgroup in which the association between mc4r-c-2745t and physical activity was
strongest. the association was absent among the carta1475g g-allele carriers.
it is important to remember that the p-values reported
here were not adjusted for multiple testing. bonferroni
adjusted p-levels would have been as low as 0.0036 compared
to 0.05. however, we have elected to report differences
significant at 0.05 in order to make sure that all potentially
useful associations are identified for subsequent studies.
in conclusion, these findings suggest that dna sequence
variation in the mc4r gene locus contributes to the
variation in physical activity level and the propensity to be
sedentary in humans. the effect is most pronounced in
young adults and in the nonobese. sequence variation in the
cart gene may modify the effect of the mc4r genotype.
