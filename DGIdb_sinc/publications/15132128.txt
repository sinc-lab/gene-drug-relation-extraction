enzyme expression profiles suggest the novel tumor-activated
fluoropyrimidine carbamate  xxxd425xxx  (xeloda) might be effective
against papillary thyroid cancers of children and young adults

abstract purpose: the ﬂuoropyrimidine carbamate
( xxxd425xxx ) is converted to 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-fu) by
 xxxg2365xxx  (tp) inside target tissues.
5-fu interferes with dna synthesis by blocking
 xxxg2366xxx  (ts) but is inactivated by  xxxg652xxx  (dpd). favorable enzyme proﬁles (high tp and low dpd) generate high
intratumor levels of 5-fu that are eﬀective against
many tumors, especially those with low ts.  xxxd425xxx  has not been tested against thyroid cancers, and
it is not known to what extent thyroid cancers express
tp, ts or dpd. methods: to test this, we determined
tp, ts and dpd in 19 thyroid cancers from young
patients (14 papillary, 4 follicular, 1 medullary) by
immunohistochemistry. after approval by the human
use committee, the intensity of tp, ts, and dpd
staining was determined by two independent examiners
and graded (absent=0 to intense=3) with >90%

concordance. results: ts was detected in 7/19 cancers
(37%), tp in 14/19 cancers (74%) and dpd in 14/19
cancers (74%). in six tumors, tp was more intense
that dpd, suggesting  xxxd425xxx  sensitivity. only
ﬁve tumors failed to express tp but four of these
expressed dpd, suggesting  xxxd425xxx  resistance.
overall, 6/19 tumors (32% of the total) had a favorable expression proﬁle, and all of them were papillary
cancers. conclusions: we conclude that the majority of
diﬀerentiated thyroid cancers (74%) express tp and
low levels of ts (63% undetectable). the results support the hypothesis that  xxxd425xxx  is activated in
the majority of diﬀerentiated thyroid cancers and that
32% have favorable expression of all three enzymes
(tp, ts, and dpd).

introduction
thyroid carcinomas are the most common endocrine
cancers in adults and children [6, 22]. most are well
diﬀerentiated and respond to surgery and radioactive
iodine (131i), but many persist, dediﬀerentiate, or undergo anaplastic transformation, resulting in more
deaths than cervical or testicular cancers [6, 22]. anaplastic thyroid cancer is among the most aggressive
human cancers, and displays relative resistance to
chemotherapy [14, 17, 19, 21]. the mechanism of drug
resistance is unknown. expression of the multiple drug
resistance 1 (mdr-1) gene is low and unrelated to
drug sensitivity [13]. hyperfractionated external beam
radiation, doxorubicin, or bleomycin, cytoxan, and
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-fu) have induced limited remissions
[18, 19, 20], and a more recent study suggests that
paclitaxel (taxol) may have some eﬀect [1]. based on
this limited success, there is a need for additional

410

therapeutic agents in the treatment of thyroid cancer
[15].
the novel, tumor-activated ﬂuoropyrimidine carbamate ( xxxd425xxx , xeloda; hoﬀman-laroche, indianapolis, ind.) is well absorbed after oral administration,
and converted inside the target tissues into 5-fu by
 xxxg2365xxx  (tp) [2, 3, 4, 5]. 5-fu interferes with dna synthesis by blocking  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (dpd) [10, 11, 12, 16]. favorable
enzyme proﬁles would have high tp and low dpd and
be eﬀective against many tumors, especially those with
low ts [10, 11, 12, 16]. because tp is generally present
at higher levels in malignant tissues,  xxxd425xxx  generates high intratumor levels of 5-fu with limited
exposure of normal tissues [10, 11, 12, 16]. our goal was
to determine if the expression proﬁles of the enzymes
that metabolize  xxxd425xxx  might be favorable for
 xxxd425xxx  treatment of thyroid cancers.

materials and methods
approval
prior approval and funding for this study (wu# 01-65001b) were
obtained from the human use committee and the department of
clinical investigation, walter reed army medical center, washington, dc.

patients
we had previously searched the automated centralized tumor
registry of the department of defense (actur) to identify all
patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer prior to 21 years of age [22].
the extent of disease at diagnosis was classiﬁed according to the
system of degroot et al. [6] and the metastasis, age, completeness
of resection, invasion, and size (macis) scoring system [9]. in the
classiﬁcation of degroot et al., class 1 disease is conﬁned to the
thyroid, class 2 involves the regional lymph nodes, class 3 extends
beyond the capsule or is inadequately resected, and class 4 has
distant metastasis. all patients <39 years of age have a macis
score calculated as 3.1 + (size·0.3) + 1 (if incomplete resection) +
1 (if extension beyond the capsule) + 3 (if distant metastasis) [9].
recurrence was deﬁned as the appearance of new disease (identiﬁed
by 131i scan or biopsy) in any patient who had been free of disease
(no disease palpable or identiﬁed by 131i scan) for at least 4 months
after initial therapy [22]. the majority of patients received their
medical care prior to the routine use of serum thyroglobulin (tg)
levels for deﬁning recurrence-free survival. for this reason, tg
levels are not used in our deﬁnitions. however, tg levels were
determined for contemporary patients (normal 3–40 ng/ml; university of southern california clinical laboratories, los angeles,
calif.). suﬃcient formalin-ﬁxed paraﬃn-embedded archival tumor
tissue was available to stain 14 papillary thyroid cancers (ptc), 4
follicular thyroid cancers (ftc), and 1 medullary thyroid cancer
(mtc) for tp, ts and dpd by speciﬁc immunohistochemistry.

immunohistochemistry
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to conﬁrm the
diagnosis, and sections immediately adjacent (5 lm) were deparaﬃnized with xylene and rehydrated [8]. antigens were retrieved
using declere (cell marque, hot springs, ariz.) and endogenous

peroxidase was quenched (3% h2o2, 30 min, room temperature).
nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked (20% normal goat serum) and the
sections were incubated with primary anti-tp (1:25, neomarkers,
fremont, calif.), anti-ts (1:50, roche, indianapolis, ind.), or antidpd (1:50, roche), followed by biotinylated secondary anti-rat
antibody (1:100, z-0455, dako, carpinteria, calif.). sections were
stained on a ventana automated slide stainer (nexes, tucson,
ariz.) using ventana dab detection and ampliﬁcation kits, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining and bluing. the presence
and intensity of each stain was quantiﬁed from absent (grade 0) to
intense (grade 3) by two independent blinded examiners with
>90% concordance. human breast cancer was used as the positive
control, and phosphate-buﬀered saline was substituted for the
primary or secondary antibodies as negative controls.

in vitro detection of ts, tp and dpd
in thyroid cancer cell lines
the mrnas encoding ts, tp and dpd were ampliﬁed from
thyroid cancer cell lines by reverse transcription/polymerase chain
reaction (rt/pcr). moderately diﬀerentiated ptc (npa), poorly
diﬀerentiated ftc (wro) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (aro81) cells were a generous gift from dr. g. juillard (university of
california, los angeles, calif.) [7]. samples were treated with
dnase (ambion, austin, tx.), total rna was extracted (trireagent, 1 ml, 0c) and 1 lg was reverse transcribed using random
(dntp)6 and the impromptu rt kit (promega, madison, wis.) at
42c for 1 h, followed by 15 min at 70c. pcr was performed in
optimized pcr buﬀer (25 ll) containing enhancer and stabilizer,
along with dntps (maxim biotech), equal amounts of sense and
antisense primers (10 pmol of each) and platinum taq polymerase
(0.625 u; invitrogen, carlsbad, calif.). parameters for tp and
dpd included an initial denaturation at 96c for 1 min, an
annealing step at 66c (tp) or 62c (dpd) for 4 min, 28 ampliﬁcation cycles at 94c for 1 min, and the respective annealing
temperatures for tp and dpd, followed by a ﬁnal extension at
72c for 7 min. for ts, denaturation was at 95c for 2 min,
followed by 30 ampliﬁcation cycles at 95c for 2 min, annealing at
58c and a 1-min ﬁnal extension. rt negative controls, and
expression of the internal housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3po4 dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) were included in each reaction.
pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels
and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. the primer sequences
are shown in table 1.

data analysis and statistical comparisons
the presence and intensity of ts, tp and dpd staining were
correlated with the histologic variant, demographic features, extent
of disease at diagnosis, and clinical outcome. statistical analyses
were performed using spss for windows 95 (version 7.5; spss,
chicago, ill.). average staining intensities were compared using
anova.

results
the clinical features of the 19 patients, stratiﬁed
according to the expression proﬁles of ts, tp and dpd,
are shown in table 2. they ranged in age from 6 to
21 years (mean 17.6±3.8 years) and had tumors with an
average size of 1.9±1.4 cm (range 0.2–5.5 cm). seven
patients (7/14, 50%) had class 1 ptc, six (6/14, 43%)
had class 2 ptc, and one (1/14, 7%) had class 4 ptc.
the average macis score for those with ptc was
3.92±1.07 (range 3.31–7.39). none of the patients had

previous radiation exposure. the patients were followed
for an average of 69±43 months (range 0–169 months).
four developed recurrent disease (4/19, 21%). the
clinical details, treatment and outcome are similar to
those of a larger cohort previously published by our
group [22].
fewer than half of the tumors stained for ts (7/19,
37%), but the majority stained for tp (14/19, 74%) and
dpd (14/19, 74%) (fig. 1). suﬃcient normal thyroid
was identiﬁed on a few slides (n=5) to determine that ts
and tp were undetectable (0/5), and that dpd was
infrequently seen (2/6) in normal thyroid. for tp, this
diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant (14/19 thyroid
cancers vs 0/5 normal thyroid, p=0.006).
six tumors (6/19, 32%) had favorable expression
proﬁles (tp was more intense than dpd; table 3) suggesting that they might respond to  xxxd425xxx . all six
were ptc. five tumors (5/19, 26%) failed to express tp
(unfavorable proﬁle). four of these (4/5, 80%) also

expressed dpd suggesting that they would be resistant
to  xxxd425xxx  (table 3). three of the ﬁve (3/5, 60%)
were ftcs and 1 (1/5, 20%) was an mtc. the
remaining eight tumors had indeterminate proﬁles in
which tp was expressed, but the intensity was less than
that of dpd (table 3). seven (7/8, 88%) were ptc and
one was an ftc (1/8, 12%).
overall, 6/14 (43%) ptc had favorable expression
proﬁles suggesting they might respond to  xxxd425xxx 
therapy. in contrast, 3/4 (75%) ftc and the only mtc
had unfavorable proﬁles suggesting resistance to  xxxd425xxx  therapy. the diﬀerence between histologic
variants, however, was not signiﬁcant (p=0.58, fishers
exact test).
we also used rt/pcr to determine the expression of
ts (fig. 2a), tp (fig. 2b) and dpd (fig. 2c) in three
moderately diﬀerentiated (npa), poorly diﬀerentiated
(wro), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (aro) cell lines.

discussion
the majority of thyroid cancers are well diﬀerentiated
and respond to surgery and 131i [22]. unfortunately,

about 20% recur and/or persist despite treatment [22].
for these patients, alternative therapies would be
attractive if systemic toxicity was minimal and if there
was a means by which to determine if the tumor was
likely to respond.
 xxxd425xxx  has many features that suggest that it
might be an acceptable agent for these patients. first, it
is converted by tp into 5-fu in malignant tissues,
limiting systemic toxicity [10, 11, 12, 16]. second, all
three of the critical enzymes involved in the metabolism
of  xxxd425xxx  can be identiﬁed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-ﬁxed paraﬃn-embedded tissue, eliminating the requirement for enzymatic assays that can
only be done on fresh tissue at the time of surgery.

fig. 2a–d rt-pcr ampliﬁcation of tp, ts and dpd. the ptcderived cell line (npa) was grown in dmem supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. total rna was extracted, reverse
transcribed and speciﬁc sequences for tp (a), ts (b), dpd (c)
and  xxxg861xxx  (d) were ampliﬁed

we examined ts, tp and dpd expression in a group
of thyroid cancers from children and young adults and
found that ts could be detected in a minority of thyroid
cancers (7/19, 37%). this would suggest that most
thyroid cancers have low levels of ts rendering them
susceptible to 5-fu. the majority of thyroid cancers
expressed tp (14/19, 74%) suggesting that  xxxd425xxx 
would be converted into 5-fu. consistent with previous
ﬁndings in breast cancer, staining for tp was more

common in thyroid cancers (14/19, 74%) than in normal
thyroid (0/5, p=0.006 by fishers exact test) [3].
unfortunately, a similar majority of thyroid cancers also
expressed dpd (14/19, 74%) which might inactivate
 xxxd425xxx  and limit eﬃcacy.
overall, six tumors (6/19, 32%) had favorable
expression proﬁles of ts, tp and dpd, suggesting that
they would be sensitive to  xxxd425xxx  therapy. all six
were ptc. the average patient age, tumor size, and
macis score for these ptc were similar to those of
previous studies, suggesting that this group is fairly
representative of ptc [22]. in contrast, 3/4 (75%) of the
ftc and the only mtc in our study had unfavorable
expression proﬁles suggesting that they might be resistant to  xxxd425xxx .
using rt/pcr we detected ts and dpd in three cell
lines derived from moderately diﬀerentiated ptc
(npa), poorly diﬀerentiated ftc (wro) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (aro) cells. tp was detected only
in the ptc-derived npa cells, suggesting that even
moderately diﬀerentiated ptc might express suﬃcient
tp to convert  xxxd425xxx  into 5-fu. unfortunately,
dpd was also detected in the npa cells.
in conclusion, 32% of all thyroid cancers in our study
and almost half the ptc (43%) had favorable tp/dpd
expression proﬁles. additional study is warranted among
older patients and those with more aggressive disease to
determine if these ﬁndings can be generalized. however,
the results do provide optimism for the potential use
of  xxxd425xxx  in the treatment of iodine-resistant ptc.
