a b s t r a c t
methadone ( xxxd2587xxx ) exerts its antinociceptive effect by activation of ␮-opioid receptors
and/or blockade of nmda receptors. the aim of this study is to determine whether the methadone
analgesic effect on neuropathic pain is achieved only by the agonism of the ␮-opioid receptors or
cooperatively with the antagonism of the nmda receptors. to this purpose, in rats with neuropathic
pain model of chronic constriction of one sciatic nerve (cci rats), we administered methadone before
or after opioid receptor blockade with naloxone and checked its effects on the spinal wide dynamic
range (wdr) neuron dynamics in three experimental conditions: on the spontaneous and noxious
evoked neuronal activities in control rats (sham operated and naïve); on iontophoretic nmda induced
neuronal hyperactivity in intact rats; on pain-related spontaneous and noxious evoked hyperactivities in cci rats. the results, as from the spike-frequency analysis, show that: (i) in control rats,
methadone inhibits the noxious evoked neuronal activity and naloxone prevents or reverses about 94%
of methadone inhibitory effect; (ii) in intact rats, pretreated with naloxone, methadone reduces the
nmda induced neuronal hyperactivity; (iii) in cci rats, methadone inhibits the neuronal spontaneous and
noxious evoked hyperactivities, and naloxone prevents or reverses about 60% of methadone inhibitory
effect.
these ﬁndings allow to conclude that methadone inhibition of the noxious evoked activity in normal
rats is achieved predominantly through the agonism of the ␮-opioid receptors, while the inhibition of
the pain-related hyperactivity in rats with signs of neuropathic pain (cci rats), involves also the nmda
receptors antagonism.

1. introduction
methadone is an opioid ␮-receptor agonist mainly used in
replacement therapy in the course of heroin detoxiﬁcation procedures [1] and, to a lesser extent, as analgesic in chronic
non-malignant pain [2] and in cancer pain [3,4]. methadone
is an atypical opioid both for the clinical behaviour and the
mechanism of action. clinical evidence show that it may induce
analgesia in patients refractory to other congener drugs [5], and
that, after methadone chronic infusion, a slower tolerance develops than after morphine infusion [6]. as for the mechanism
of action, studies in the rat central nervous system show that,

other than activates the ␮-opioid receptors, the drug also binds
with low afﬁnity nmda receptors as non-competitive antagonist
[7–9].
the commonly used laboratory form of methadone (used also
in this study) is the racemic d-l-methadone mixture that recent
data ranked as the most potent nmda-receptor inhibiting opioid [10]. the methadone analgesic effect could thus result from
the activation of ␮-opioid receptors, reversible by naloxone, and
the blockade of nmda receptors. experimental results show that
the methadone-induced antinociception is mediated only by the
␮-opioid receptors agonism in intact rats [11] and in rats with
inﬂammatory pain [12], and involves also the nmda receptors
antagonism in the rat formalin test [13].
given the crucial role played by the nmda receptors activation on neuropathic pain [14], we decided to deeper investigate
the mechanisms of methadone antinociceptive action on this
pathology.

as a suitable model of neuropathic pain the rats with chronic
constriction of one sciatic nerve (cci rats) according to the bennett
and xie technique [15] were used.
the cci rat models show both sensory disorders matching
those clinically observed, namely spontaneous pain, thermal and
mechanical hyperalgesia, prolonged pain, and spinal neuron abnormal activities such as spontaneous hyperactivity, noxious evoked
exaggerated responses followed by long-lasting afterdischarges
[16,17], likely providing the substrate for the sensory disorders
[18,19].
the abnormal neuron excitability results mainly from central
sensitization, a complex sequence of events that show a strong
dependence on nmda-receptor activation [14] and are blocked by
the speciﬁc antagonists [20].
many data on the role of nmda receptors and of their antagonists indicate the nmda receptor blockade as a mechanism for the
neuropathic pain antinociception [21–24].
our aim was thus to determine whether the methadone
antinociceptive effect on neuropathic pain is cooperatively attained
by ␮-opioid agonism and nmda receptors antagonism.
to this purpose, methadone was tested on the neuronal
spontaneous and noxious evoked activities: (i) in control rats
(sham-operated and naïve), (ii) in intact rats, in which iontophoretic
nmda induced neuronal hyperactivity, mimicking that described in
cci rats [25], (iii) in cci rats, showing pain-related spinal neurons
hyperactivity whose inhibition is taken as an index of antinociception.
furthermore, to differentiate the involvement of the two
mechanisms, the effect of naloxone administered before or after
methadone was tested.

2. materials and methods
thirty-eight adult male sprague–dawley rats were used. two
weeks before the electrophysiological experiments, in 22 rats one
sciatic nerve was constricted (cci rats) according to the technique
of bennett and xie [15]. brieﬂy, in rats deeply anaesthetized (pentobarbital 50 mg/kg i.p.), the sciatic nerve was isolated in aseptic
conditions and four loose ligatures were placed around it. a detailed
description of the procedure is reported elsewhere [16].
four rats underwent a surgical procedure without ligatures
(sham), seven rats were naïve and ﬁve intact rats underwent experiments with iontophoretic nmda.

2.1. behavioural index
in cci rats, the development of abnormal pain-related
behaviours was evaluated at the 7th, 10th and 13th postoperative
(po) day, by the hot-plate (hp) test for thermal hyperalgesia and by
the von frey ﬁlament test for mechanical hyperalgesia.
thermal hyperalgesia. the rats were placed on a platform at 52 ◦ c
and the nociception threshold was determined by measuring the
paw licking latency (pll in seconds), i.e. the time from the onset of
the test to the licking of hind paw.
mechanical hyperalgesia. von frey calibrated ﬁlaments from 0.4
to 29 g (cut off) were applied to the mid-plantar surface of hindpaw
and the paw withdrawal threshold (pwt in grams) was measured.
each ﬁlament was repeatedly applied, in ascending stiffness order,
against the paw until it bent. a brisk withdrawal of the hind limb
was considered as positive response. the threshold value is equal to
the ﬁlament value for which half of the applications were positive.
lower values of pll and of pwt prior to the acute experiments (13th
po day) compared to those before surgery gave an index of thermal
and mechanical hyperalgesia.

2.2. electrophysiological experiments
at 14th po day, the rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) and, after cannulation of one jugular vein,
one common carotid artery and the trachea, were mounted in a
metal frame and a laminectomy from l1 to s1 was performed. the
body temperature, maintained at 38 ◦ c, the arterial blood pressure and the heart rate were continuously monitored. the rats
were then paralyzed with  xxxd2174xxx  (20 mg/(kg h) i.v.)
and maintained in artiﬁcial ventilation under gaseous anaesthesia (isoﬂurane® 0.6–0.8 l/min and oxigen 0.15 l/min). the stability
of arterial pressure (values of 90–110 mmhg) and heart rate
(values of 310 ±20 beats/min) during noxious stimulation and
the absence of reaction to hindpaw pinching before the induction of muscle paralysis signalled the adequacy of anaesthesia
level.
the neuronal extracellular activity was recorded using
platinum–iridium microelectrodes or the carbon ﬁbre of fourbarrelled micropipettes (carbonstar-4) placed, under a dissection
microscope control, on the surface of spinal cord at the l5–l6
levels and advanced by an electronic microdrive (narishige, japan)
at 2 ␮m steps.
the recorded neuron depth (always in the range between 700
and 850 ␮m) was taken from the mean microdrive readings of
the descent and the ascent endpoints relative to the cord surface.
in the experiments with iontophoresis, the micropipette barrels were ﬁlled, respectively with a freshly prepared solution of
nmda (10 mm in deionized water, ph 8), vehicle solvent and saline
solution, this last used for the automatic iontophoretic current
balancing. a retention current (5 na) was applied to avoid passive diffusion of the substances out of the iontophoretic barrels.
ejection, retention and balancing currents were regulated by a
constant-current apparatus (medical systems, model bh-2, greenvale, ny). nmda was ejected with a negative 50–60 na current to
achieve a stable excitatory effect [25].
the study was conducted on wide dynamic range (wdr) neurons, selected on the basis of their responsiveness to innocuous
(light brushing with a cotton-tipped stick) and, at a greater degree,
to noxious mechanical stimuli (calibrated pinching of 400 g/2 mm2
by a pressure regulated algometer, somedic, stockholm) applied for
10 s to the hindpaw area supplied by the sciatic nerve.
the evoked responses were quantiﬁed after subtracting the
spontaneous activity. the afterdischarge duration was deﬁned as
the time interval from the end of stimulation to the return to the
pre-stimulus discharge frequency value. then, for each neuron,
the spontaneous and the noxious evoked activities before and, at
ﬁxed times, after the drugs treatment were compared. only the
neurons showing a complete recovery to the pre-drug frequency
discharge values were included in the statistics (90% of the tested
neurons).
four methadone doses (1, 3, 5, 7 mg/kg i.v., injected in 10 s),
chosen by referring to the literature, were tested in a series
of pilot dose–effect experiments (not included in the results),
in control, intact + nmda and cci rats. the dose that induced
inhibitory effect unmodiﬁed by the successive higher dose was
selected for the experiments. such doses were, respectively 3 mg/kg
for the control and the cci rats, 5 mg/kg for the nmda treated
rats.
as for naloxone, we tested four doses (1, 3, 5, 10 mg/kg i.v.,
injected in 10 s), chosen by referring to the literature, in pilot experiments (not included in the results). the dose of 5 mg/kg i.v. was
selected as it induced a reversal effect, unmodiﬁed by further higher
doses.
methadone and naloxone were dissolved in sterile saline.
the neuronal sample (n = 76) was collected in different groups:

286

2.3. control rats
the effects of methadone (3 mg/kg i.v.) was tested on the spontaneous and noxious evoked activities of 22 neurons (8 in sham rats,
14 in naïve rats). naloxone (5 mg/kg) was administered 7 min after
methadone injection to check its reversal effect on 9 out of the 22
neurons (5 in sham, 4 in naïve). finally, naloxone was administered
7 min before methadone to check its preventing effect on 6 neurons
(in naïve rats).
2.4. intact rats (+naloxone) + nmda
naloxone was injected on 10 neurons to antagonize the ␮opioid receptors. nmda was then ejected by iontophoresis to
induce neuronal hyperactivity. methadone (5 mg/kg i.v.) was
injected during the nmda iontophoresis, and after 5 min its
effect on the spontaneous and noxious evoked activities was
tested.
2.5. cci rats
44 neurons were recorded ipsilaterally to the injured side and
the effect of methadone (3 mg/kg i.v.) on the neuronal spontaneous
and evoked hyperactivity was analysed along three protocols:
(1) on 12 neurons the effects were tested at 5, 15, 25, 45, 55, 65 min
from the injection stop;
(2) on 15 neurons the effects were tested at 5 min from the injection
stop. then, 2 min later, naloxone was administered (5 mg/kg i.v.)
and the methadone effect was re-tested at 5, 10, 20 min from
naloxone and at 65 min from methadone;
(3) on 15 neurons the methadone inhibitory effect and the complete recovery of the activity were checked. then, naloxone was
administered to antagonize the ␮-opioid receptors and, 10 min
later, methadone was injected and its effects was re-tested at 5,
10, 20, 65 min from the injection.
to minimize the number of animals used, the vehicle was tested
only on two neurons, as we repeatedly veriﬁed its ineffectiveness
(for example ref. [16]).
we studied no more than two neurons/rat.
neuronal signals (single unit spikes) were extracellularly
recorded and acquired by electronically regulated high/low-pass
ﬁlters (at 300 and 6000 hz, respectively) after pre-ampliﬁcation
(2×). the electrodes exhibited 0.9–2 m impedances. dedicated
hardware and speciﬁc software programs (data wave, berthoud,
co, usa or neuralynx, bozeman, mt, usa) allowed for the analog signal recording, digital conversion and data storing. off-line
spike sorting and clustering dedicated programs (osort) [26] and
locally developed programs, allowed for proper spike isolation. the
method assured also the choice of stably recorded cells throughout
the experimental sessions. we estimated all the statistics on these
pre-treated data.
the data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. statistical
evaluation was made by one-way anova for variance analysis with post hoc scheffè test, criterion for signiﬁcance was
p < 0.05.
all the animals have been treated along the italian and european
laws on animal treatment in scientiﬁc research (italian bioethical
committee, law decree on the treatment of animals in research, 27
january 1992, no. 116). the national research council adheres to the
international committee on laboratory animal science (iclas) on
behalf of united nations educational, scientiﬁc and cultural organizations (unesco), the council for international organizations of
medical sciences (cioms) and the international union of biological sciences (iubs). as such, no protocol-speciﬁc local approval

was required. in addition, all experiments were carried out in strict
observance of the ethical guidelines of the international association
for the study of pain (iasp) [27].

3. results
3.1. control rats
naïve rats. the neurons (n = 14) discharged spontaneously to a
frequency of 3.0 ± 0.18 spikes/s and responded to mechanical noxious stimulation with a mean frequency of 23.8 ± 1.3 spikes/s, no
afds were observed. methadone did not affect the spontaneous
activity and suppressed the noxious evoked responses (tested
on six neurons, activity recorded after 5 min). naloxone, injected
7 min after methadone reversed this effect by 94% (mean value
22.4 ± 1.2 spikes/s) (tested on four neurons, activity recorded after
5 min) (fig. 1a). methadone injected 7 min after pretreatment with
naloxone, did not affect the spontaneous and the noxious evoked
activities (tested on six neurons, activity recorded after ﬁve and
30 min) (fig. 1b).
sham rats. the neurons (n = 8), recorded on the side ipsilateral to the surgical procedure, discharged spontaneously at a
frequency of 3.1 ± 0.2 spikes/s and responded to mechanical noxious stimulation with a mean frequency of 24.3 ± 1.4 spikes/s.
no afd was present. methadone did not affect the spontaneous activity and suppressed the noxious evoked responses.
naloxone, injected 7 min after methadone reversed this effect
by 93% (mean value 22.8 ± 1.6 spikes/s) (tested on ﬁve neurons).

3.2. intact rats (+naloxone) + nmda
the neurons (n = 10) discharged spontaneously at a frequency of 2.9 ± 0.2 spikes/s and responded to mechanical noxious stimulation with a mean values of 26.4 ± 1.6 spikes/s.
naloxone, administered 5 min before nmda, did not modify
spontaneous (3.0 ± 0.16 spikes/s) and noxious evoked activities
(26.6 ± 1.7 spikes/s) (fig. 2a). the iontophoresized nmda significantly increased the spontaneous activity to a mean value of
11.8 ± 1.1 (p < 0.001) and the noxious evoked activity to a mean value
of 40.7 ± 1.8 spikes/s (p < 0.001) (recorded after 3 min) (fig. 2a).
methadone, administered 4 min from the start of nmda iontophoretic ejection, reduced the hyperactivity (recorded after
5 min) to approximately the values pre-nmda: namely, the spontaneous activity to 2.8 ± 0.16 spikes/s (p < 0.001) and the noxious
evoked activity to 24.8 ± 2.0 spikes/s (p < 0.001) (fig. 2a). stable values of neuronal activities were recorded also at 30 min after the stop
of nmda ejection (fig. 2a).
these results are summarized in fig. 2b.
3.3. cci rats
all cci rats showed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia on the
injured side, as veriﬁed by the decrease in pll compared to the

287

value before surgery (8–11 s vs. 19–22 s) and by the decrease in
pwt compared to value before surgery (1.5–7 g vs. 14–29 g).
forty-four wdr neurons recorded at l5–l6 level at a depth of
70–850 ␮m were studied.
the neurons discharged spontaneously with mean frequency of
18.6 ± 0.87 spikes/s and responded to mechanical noxious stimulation with mean frequency of 60.5 ± 1.1 spikes/s and afterdischarges
lasting 60 ± 2 s.
as can be seen in the example in figs. 3a and 4a, the methadone
injection induced the reduction of the spontaneous hyperactivity
to a mean value of 6.2 ± 0.48 spikes/s (33% of the pre-drug value)
(p < 0.001), the suppression or the reduction of the noxious evoked
responses to a mean value of 5.3 ± 0.5 spikes/s (8% of the pre-drug
value) (p < 0.001) and the suppression of the afterdischarges.
protocol 1. as represented in fig. 3b, the methadone inhibitory
effect on the noxious evoked responses peaked in 5 min
(5.3 ± 0.35 spikes/s), was stable for 15 min, diminished at 25 min
(19.6 ± 0.91 spikes/s) and 45 min (37.8 ± 0.98 spikes/s) and ceased
after 55–65 min (57.2 ± 1.1–60.5 ± 1.1 spikes/s) (example from one
wdr neuron in fig. 3a).
protocol 2. naloxone, administered 7 min after methadone, partially reversed, within 5 min, the inhibition of the spontaneous
hyperactivity from 6.2 ± 0.48 to 10.4 ± 0.94 spikes/s (from 33% to
55% of the pre-drugs values) (p < 0.05) and the inhibition of the nox-

at 55–65 min from methadone (example from one wdr neuron in
fig. 4a).
protocol 3: methadone injected 10 min after naloxone and tested
5 min later, induced, respectively, the reduction of the spontaneous
hyperactivity from 18.6 ± 0.87 to a mean value of 11.2 ± 1.09 spikes/s
(60% of the pre-drug value) (p < 0.001), the reduction of the noxious evoked activity from 60.5 ± 1.10 spikes/s to a mean value of

these results are summarized in fig. 5.

4. discussion
the results of this study show that  xxxd2587xxx , respectively inhibits the noxious evoked responses in control rats, an effect
almost completely prevented or reversed by naloxone, inhibits the
neuronal hyperactivity induced by exogenous nmda in intact rats,
where naloxone pretreatment antagonized the opioid component
of methadone inhibition and inhibits the pain-related neuronal
activity in cci rats, an effect only partially reversed by naloxone.

the ability or the failure of naloxone to block methadone effects
signals whether the drug acts primarily by an opioid or a nonopioid mechanism. the methadone inhibitory effect in control rats,
reversed or prevented by naloxone, should thus result from the activation of the ␮-opioid receptors. this agrees with data obtained
on intact rats showing that opioid receptor mostly mediates the
intrathecal racemic and  xxxd2587xxx  inhibition of c-ﬁbre-evoked
neuronal activity and wind-up [11]. by contrast, the partial reversal or prevention by naloxone of the methadone inhibitory effect in
neuropathic rats suggest that, in this condition, the ␮-opioid receptors activation is not enough an exhaustive process for a complete
inhibitory effect, likely achieved with the concurrent blockade of
nmda receptors activity.
direct evidence for the methadone property to antagonize the
nmda receptor activity arises from our results showing methadone
reduction of the nmda induced hyperactivity in the rats with previous naloxone blockade of the ␮-opioid receptors.
indirect supports for the involvement of the two mechanisms
come from studies on the dynamic proﬁle changes of opioid and
nmda receptors in neuropathic conditions.
indeed, in several models of experimentally induced neuropathy a number of signiﬁcant changes takes place, like the nmda
receptor quantity [14] and sensitivity [28] increase ipsilaterally to
the nerve injury, the ␮-receptor reduced pre- and post-synaptic
efﬁciency [29] and the loss of ␮-opioid receptors [30] with resultant reduced methadone ␮-directed efﬁcacy. moreover, ketamine,
a non-competitive nmda antagonist, associated with methadone
shows stronger antinociceptive effects than in association with the
pure ␮-agonist morphine [31].

m.l. sotgiu et al. / pharmacological research 60 (2009) 284–290

289

by contrast, in a rat model of inﬂammatory pain,  xxxd2587xxx 
failed to enhance the mechanical nociceptive threshold and to
reduce the iontophoretic nmda dorsal horn neuron hyperactivity after naloxone [12]. the discrepancy with the present results,
and with data showing that methadone inhibits nmda induced
hyperalgesia [32], could be tentatively attributed to differences
in experimental protocols, in anaesthesia, or in pain models. this
would align with the report that the nmda receptor antagonist mk801 prevents hyperalgesia in a rat model of neuropathic pain but
not in a model of inﬂammatory pain [23].
5. conclusions
the main result of this study shows that in a rat model of neuropathic pain the methadone antinociceptive action involves the
nmda receptor antagonism. this may provide an experimental substrate for its therapeutic use in neuropathic pain, a pathology where
nmda receptor activation plays a crucial role [14] and nmda receptor antagonists are effective analgesics [34] even for symptoms less
responsive to pure opioids [36].
indeed, methadone, used alone or in combination with coanalgesics or other analgesics has been hypothesized as an ideal opioid
drug for neuropathic pain treatment [37]. although the data transfer from the laboratory experience to the clinical practice is not
obvious, our ﬁndings, deeper probing into the mechanism of modulated agonism and antagonism of drug actions, could add a
signiﬁcant argument to this hypothesis.

data showing that intrathecal  xxxd2587xxx  inhibits the nmda
induced hyperalgesia in rats [32] further support the involvement
of nmda receptor. yet, the delayed development of methadone tolerance in neuropathic rats [33], a phenomenon also described in
clinical practice [6], seems in close relation to the nmda blocking
action. this opens potential routes for long-term methadone treatments in neuropathic pain [34] or in chronic non-malignant pain,
as recently described [35].
