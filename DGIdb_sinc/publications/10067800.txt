objective to assess the antihypertensive ef®cacy and
safety of the novel  xxxg100xxx  antagonist,  xxxd3303xxx ,
compared with that of enalapril in elderly patients with mild
to moderate hypertension.
design a 26-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallelgroup, dosage titration study.
methods a total of 278 patients aged > 65 years were
randomized to either  xxxd3303xxx  or enalapril once a day. the
 xxxd3303xxx  dosage was increased from 20 to
40±80 mg and that of enalapril from 5 to 10±20 mg at
4-week intervals until trough supine diastolic blood pressure
was , 90 mmhg. after 12 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide at
12.5±25 mg once a day was added to the treatment regimen
of those patients not controlled on monotherapy.
results both treatments lowered blood pressure in a
comparable and clinically meaningful manner. the
adjusted mean changes from baseline in supine diastolic
blood pressure at trough were ÿ12.8 mmhg for
 xxxd3303xxx  and ÿ11.4 mmhg for enalapril (p  0.074).
mean changes in supine systolic blood pressure were
ÿ22.1 mmhg for  xxxd3303xxx  and ÿ20.1 mmhg for enalapril
(p  0.350). overall, 63 and 62% of patients responded to
 xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril, respectively, with a supine

introduction

the renin±angiotensin±aldosterone system plays an
important role in blood pressure regulation [1]. the
central component of this system is  xxxg99xxx ,
which causes vasoconstriction, stimulates aldosterone
release, increases sodium and water reabsorption by the
kidneys and potentiates the actions of norepinephrine.
 xxxg99xxx  is produced systemically by the action of
the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) on  xxxg99xxx , and locally in the heart and other tissues via
alternate pathways [2]. ace inhibitors provide effective
treatment for hypertension by blocking  xxxg99xxx 
generated through the ace pathway; however, these
agents do not suppress  xxxg99xxx  generated by
other pathways. furthermore, ace inhibitors are not
selective in that they also inhibit the metabolism of
other hormones. for example, they also inhibit kininase

diastolic blood pressure of , 90 mmhg. both regimens
provided effective blood pressure lowering over the 24 h
dosing interval, as determined by ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring. both regimens were well tolerated;
however, patients on the enalapril regimen had more than
double the incidence of treatment-related cough compared
with those on the  xxxd3303xxx  regimen (16 versus 6.5%).
conclusions these results demonstrate that  xxxd3303xxx 
is well tolerated and is at least as effective as enalapril in
treating elderly patients with mild to moderate
hypertension. j hypertens 1999, 17:293±302 & lippincott

ii, thereby blocking the metabolism of bradykinin and
leading to its accumulation. bradykinin, in turn, is
believed to be responsible for the high incidence of
cough in patients treated with ace inhibitors [3,4].
an alternate and more selective approach to blood
pressure regulation is to antagonize the actions of
 xxxg99xxx  at the receptor level [5].  xxxg99xxx 
interacts with two receptor subtypes, at1 and  xxxg101xxx  ; the
at1 subtype appears to mediate all  xxxg99xxx 
effects that are important for blood pressure control,
whereas the  xxxg101xxx  receptor may be more important
during embryogenesis [5]. in clinical studies, at1
antagonists, such as losartan and  xxxd3487xxx , have provided blood pressure lowering that is comparable to
that of ace inhibitors [6,7]. furthermore, in patients
with a history of ace inhibitor-induced cough, the at1

294 journal of hypertension 1999, vol 17 no 2

antagonists produced a signi®cantly lower incidence of
cough than ace inhibitors [8,9].
 xxxd3303xxx  is an orally active, selective, nonpeptide,
substituted benzimidazole  xxxg100xxx  antagonist that
has been evaluated for the treatment of hypertension
[10].  xxxd3303xxx  is a selective at1 antagonist, without
any apparent at1 agonist activity, and it does not
interact with other receptors that are known to be
involved in cardiovascular regulation [11]. furthermore,
 xxxd3303xxx  does not inhibit  xxxg36xxx , nor does it
affect plasma renin or ace activity. in animal models,
 xxxd3303xxx  is an effective antihypertensive agent that
appears to be more potent than losartan [12±14].
furthermore, it reduces some of the morphologic
sequelae of hypertension, including glomerulosclerosis
and cardiac hypertrophy in tgr(mren2)27 transgenic
rats, a model that exhibits fulminant hypertension with
marked cardiac hypertrophy [12,15].
in dose-®nding studies of  xxxd3303xxx , doses ranging
from 20 to 160 mg have been evaluated [16,17]. no
obvious dose-dependency was found in these studies,
but the highest response rate (de®ned as a supine
diastolic pressure of , 90 mmhg) and the largest fall in
diastolic pressure were found in the group treated with
80 mg  xxxd3303xxx . no difference in pharmacokinetics
between elderly and younger healthy subjects has been
demonstrated (boehringer ingelheim, data on ®le), and
only limited experience in elderly patients was available at the start of the present study. the titration
scheme chosen was therefore based on a starting dose
of 20 mg  xxxd3303xxx , followed by 40 and 80 mg if the
patient did not respond to the treatment and the
addition of hydrochlorothiazide if the 80 mg dose
proved insuf®cient.
more than half of all deaths in patients aged . 65 years
are caused by cardiac and cerebrovascular disease [18].
because hypertension is a major risk factor for these
diseases, it is critically important that blood pressure is
controlled in elderly patients, especially as their proportion continues to increase in many populations worldwide. therefore, the present multicenter, double-blind,
dose-titration study was designed to compare the longterm antihypertensive ef®cacy and safety of  xxxd3303xxx 
with that of enalapril in elderly patients with mild to
moderate hypertension, with hydrochlorothiazide added
as necessary.

patients and methods

this study was performed in accordance with the
declaration of helsinki and the national requirements
for the conduct of clinical trials in denmark, finland
and sweden. the protocol was approved by an ethics
committee, and all patients provided written informed
consent before enrolment.

patients
inclusion criteria

female or male patients aged > 65 years with mild to
moderate hypertension were eligible if morning mean
supine diastolic blood pressure was > 95 and < 114
mmhg at the ®nal two consecutive visits of the 3±5
week placebo run-in phase, and if mean supine diastolic blood pressure did not vary by more than 10 mmhg
between these visits.
exclusion criteria

among the exclusion criteria were known or suspected
secondary hypertension, hepatic or renal dysfunction,
bilateral renal artery stenosis or post-renal transplant,
new york heart association class iii or iv heart
failure, recent myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery,
clinically relevant arrhythmias, clinically signi®cant
sodium depletion, hypokalemia or hyperkalemia,
poorly controlled diabetes, chronic use of oral anticoagulants, high doses of nonsteroidal anti-in¯ammatory
drugs or acetaminophen, or salt substitutes containing
 xxxd2988xxx . the use of an investigational drug
within the past month or a medication known to affect
blood pressure also resulted in exclusion. patients with
mean supine systolic blood pressure > 220 mmhg or
supine diastolic blood pressure . 114 mmhg at any
time during the placebo run-in phase were also excluded.
methods
study design

this 26 week, randomized, multicenter, double-dummy, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-titration study
was conducted at 22 study centers, including two in
denmark, six in finland and 14 in sweden. there
were four phases: screening, placebo run-in and doubleblind titration and maintenance.
screening

in order to determine eligibility, a medical history was
obtained from the patients and they then underwent a
comprehensive physical examination, including a 12lead electrocardiogram (ecg). at this time, all antihypertensive medications and any other excluded medications were withdrawn.
placebo run-in

patients who satis®ed the inclusion and exclusion
criteria entered a 3±5 week, single-blind, double-dummy, placebo run-in phase, during which time they took
two placebo tablets each morning. these patients
visited the clinic during weeks 2 and 3, and supine and
standing blood pressure and pulse rate were measured
at trough to determine whether the blood pressure
inclusion criteria were satis®ed. those who did not
meet the inclusion criteria in week 2 were re-evaluated
in week 3, and a third time 1±2 weeks later.

 xxxd3303xxx  in elderly hypertensives karlberg et al. 295

at the ®nal placebo run-in visit, a 12-lead ecg,
laboratory tests, a quality-of-life questionnaire (sf 36
health survey) [19] and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were conducted. patient compliance of
at least 50% as estimated by pill counting was required
for continuation in the study.
treatment

the double-blind, double-dummy treatment period
consisted of a 16-week titration phase followed by a 10week maintenance phase. patients who satis®ed the
entrance requirements during the placebo run-in were
randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to the initial dose of 20 mg
 xxxd3303xxx  or 5 mg enalapril. the dose of each drug
was increased twice as required,  xxxd3303xxx  to 40 mg
and then 80 mg and enalapril to 10 mg and then 20 mg.
blood pressure was measured every 4 weeks during the
titration phase; the treatment dose was uptitrated to
the next dose level if mean trough diastolic blood
pressure was > 90 mmhg or continued at the same
dose level if diastolic blood pressure was , 90 mmhg.
the dose of  xxxd3303xxx  or enalapril was not increased
after week 12. any patient whose trough diastolic blood
pressure was > 90 mmhg in week 12 while on the
third dose level, or in week 16 on any dose level, was
given hydrochlorothiazide at 12.5 mg once a day in
addition to the existing treatment regimen. during the
maintenance phase, the patients were continued on the
effective treatment dose regimens determined during
titration. hydrochlorothiazide was uptitrated to 25 mg
at any time during the maintenance phase if needed to
achieve blood pressure control. in weeks 12 and 26, a
12-lead ecg, 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and laboratory tests were performed and the
quality-of-life questionnaire completed. at each clinic
visit, patient compliance was estimated by a pill count,
and those whose compliance was assessed at , 80% or
. 120% on two consecutive visits or at , 50% on any
visit were exluded from the study.
ef®cacy assessments

trough blood pressure was measured three times at
2 min intervals after the patient had rested quietly in
the supine position for 5 min, and then after standing,
using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. the
supine and standing pulse rates were measured immediately after the second blood pressure measurements.
the primary ef®cacy endpoint was the change from
baseline in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure
at trough, assessed from each patient's last observation
during the double-blind treatment period. secondary
endpoints included the proportion of patients with
normalized
supine
diastolic
blood
pressure
(, 90 mmhg) at trough, the diastolic blood pressure
response on a three-level ordinal scale (full response:
supine diastolic blood pressure , 90 mmhg and/or

reduction from baseline of > 10 mmhg; partial response: reduction from baseline in supine diastolic
blood pressure of > 7 mmhg to , 10 mmhg; minimal/
no response), the proportion of patients with an adequate systolic blood pressure response (reduction from
baseline of > 10 mmhg) and the change from baseline
in supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood
pressure measured after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 26 weeks of
treatment.
at 16 study sites, continuous 24 h ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring was performed using a spacelabs
model 90207 monitor (spacelabs, redmond, washington, usa). the monitor was activated every 20 min
during the day and hourly during the night (2200±
0559 h). data were sent electronically via modem for
entry and analysis of 24 h, daytime and night-time
mean blood pressure and pulse rate. quality of life
changes were determined using the sf-36 health status
questionnaire (health outcomes institute, boston,
massachusetts, usa). plasma renin activity was determined during week 3 of the placebo run-in period and
week 12 of the double-blind treatment period, using a
1
speci®c and validated radioimmunoassay (rianen  xxxg99xxx  kit, dupont medical products, boston,
massachusetts, usa) on blood samples collected after
the patients had rested in the supine position for
30 min; the limit of detection was 0:1 ìg=l per h
[20,21].
safety assessments

all adverse events reported by the patient or observed
by the investigator were recorded according to their
severity, duration and relation to study treatment.
serious adverse events included those that were fatal or
immediately life-threatening, resulted in disability or
required prolonged hospitalization. any adverse event
that occurred within 5 days of the last drug dose or any
death within 14 days after the end of the study was also
reported. clinically relevant changes in 12-lead ecg
and laboratory tests and orthostatic changes in vital
signs were included in the safety assessment.
statistics

an analysis of ef®cacy was performed on the intent-totreat population, which included all patients who took
at least one treatment dose and had baseline data and
at least one postdrug blood pressure measurement at
trough. the mean change from baseline in supine
systolic and diastolic blood pressure at trough was
analyzed by analysis of covariance, which included
terms for treatment, country, center within country and
baseline blood pressure. descriptive analyses were
performed on secondary ef®cacy endpoints and for
patients classi®ed in subgroups according to age (, 74
and > 75 years) and sex. changes from baseline in
plasma renin activity were analyzed by wilcoxon's test

296 journal of hypertension 1999, vol 17 no 2

for comparisons between treatments and by wilcoxon's
matched-pair signed-rank test for comparisons within
treatments.
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters were
summarized descriptively, and the trough : peak ratio
was calculated. the quality-of-life questionnaire results
were described by univariate statistics for baseline and
last observation responses. changes from baseline were
analyzed by a linear model with baseline response as
the covariate and terms for treatment, country and
treatment by country interaction.
all patients exposed to any dose of double-blind
treatment were included in the safety analysis. adverse
events were summarized by incidence rates, whereas
other parameters were assessed by changes from baseline and by the frequency of ®ndings of a prede®ned
magnitude.

results

patient disposition and baseline demographics

of the 356 patients who were screened and entered the
placebo run-in phase, 278 (78%) were randomly allocated to either  xxxd3303xxx  (n  139) or enalapril
(n  139). the 78 patients who were not randomized
either failed to meet blood pressure inclusion criteria,
violated an exclusion criterion or did not meet compliance criteria during the placebo run-in period.
the  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril groups were well
matched with respect to patient demographics and
baseline characteristics (table 1). the mean duration
of hypertension was 12 years, with 76% having received
antihypertensive medication in the 4 weeks before
enrollment including, in decreasing order of frequency,
diuretics, â-blockers, ace inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. mean baseline supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 179.0 and 101.3 mmhg,
respectively.

table 1

patient discontinuations and drug exposure

a total of 251 (90.3%) patients completed the 26-week
double-blind treatment, including 128 (92.1%) patients
in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 123 (88.5%) in the
enalapril group. only one patient (0.7%) in each drug
group withdrew due to lack of ef®cacy, whereas 11
(7.9%) patients taking  xxxd3303xxx  and 16 (11.5%) patients taking enalapril withdrew due to an adverse
event. the remaining seven (2.5%) patients discontinued for administrative or other reasons.
six (2.2%) patients were excluded from the intent-totreat population. two patients who did not meet the
supine diastolic blood pressure eligibility requirements
during the run-in phase were randomized to each
treatment group. two additional patients were accidentally randomized to the enalapril group during the
placebo run-in phase. all six patients received at least
one dose of study medication; however, no postdose
trough blood pressure measurements were taken.
therefore, the intent-to-treat population consisted of
272 patients.
antihypertensive ef®cacy

both the  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril treatments produced
clinically meaningful blood pressure reductions. the
placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in supine
diastolic blood pressure at trough was ÿ12.8 mmhg for
 xxxd3303xxx  and ÿ11.4 mmhg for enalapril (p  0.074),
and the corresponding changes in supine systolic blood
pressure were ÿ22.1 mmhg for  xxxd3303xxx  and
ÿ20.1 mmhg for enalapril (p  0.350; fig. 1). the
mean changes from baseline in the mean supine pulse
rate were ÿ1:9 beats=min and ÿ2:4 beats=min in the
 xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril groups, respectively.
a signi®cant proportion of patients responded to each
treatment. at the last available blood pressure assessment at trough, 86 (63%) patients taking  xxxd3303xxx 
and 84 (62%) patients taking enalapril had achieved a

(fig. 2). furthermore, 96 (71%) patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 93 (68%) patients in the enalapril
group achieved a supine diastolic blood pressure of
, 90 mmhg or a reduction from baseline in supine
diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmhg (fig. 2).
of these responders, 36% in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and

38% in the enalapril group were taking hydrochlorothiazide, but monotherapy was suf®cient in the remaining
patients. with respect to supine systolic blood pressure,
95 (70%) patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 91
(67%) in the enalapril group achieved a reduction of at
least 10 mmhg (fig. 2).
reductions in mean supine systolic and diastolic blood
pressure at trough were evident at the ®rst evaluation
in week 4 (fig. 3). at this time, the mean reduction
from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure was
ÿ6.9 mmhg with 20 mg  xxxd3303xxx  and ÿ4.7 mmhg
with 5 mg enalapril; 33 and 27% of patients treated
with  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril, respectively, achieved
the target diastolic blood pressure of , 90 mmhg with
the lowest dose of each treatment. greater blood
pressure reductions were realized as the treatment dose
was uptitrated for those patients whose supine diastolic
blood pressure remained > 90 mmhg. by the end of
monotherapy at week 12, the adjusted mean change in
supine diastolic blood pressure at trough was ÿ10.0
mmhg for 20±80 mg  xxxd3303xxx  and ÿ8.0 mmhg for
5±20 mg enalapril. similarly, the reduction in supine
sbp was ÿ15.5 and ÿ12.7 mmhg for  xxxd3303xxx  and
enalapril, respectively. by week 12, 75 (57%)  xxxd3303xxx -treated patients and 63 (49%) enalapril-treated patients had achieved a trough supine diastolic blood
pressure of , 90 mmhg.
the addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to the

levels while on monotherapy. nineteen (44%) out of 43
patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 22 (49%) out of
45 patients in the enalapril group who did not reach
target supine diastolic blood pressure on monotherapy
did so after 4 weeks of added hydrochlorothiazide. the
mean changes in supine systolic and diastolic blood
pressure between weeks 12 and 16 after the addition of
hydrochlorothiazide were ÿ10.1 and ÿ6.6 mmhg, respectively, with  xxxd3303xxx , and ÿ12.0 and ÿ6.7
mmhg, respectively, with enalapril. furthermore, an
additional seven (32%) out of 22 patients taking
 xxxd3303xxx  and six (26%) out of 23 patients taking
enalapril achieved the target supine diastolic blood
pressure in week 26 after the hydrochlorothiazide dose
was increased to 25 mg. the mean changes in supine
systolic and diastolic blood pressure between weeks 16
and 26 for patients treated with  xxxd3303xxx  and titrated to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide were ÿ3.8 and
ÿ3.2 mmhg, respectively, and for those treated with
enalapril, ÿ7.8 and ÿ5.2 mmhg, respectively.
plasma renin activity

after 12 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3303xxx  or enalapril monotherapy, plasma renin activity increased by
a median of 0:8 ng=ml per h in both groups. there was
no statistical difference between treatment groups
(p  0.22).
subgroup analyses

both  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril were effective in patients who were , 75 years of age and in those aged 75
years or older (table 2). for the  xxxd3303xxx  regimen,
the adjusted mean reductions from baseline in supine
diastolic blood pressure at trough were slightly greater
in patients aged , 75 years (ÿ13.2 mmhg) than in
those aged > 75 years (ÿ11.9 mmhg). in contrast, for
the enalapril regimen, slightly greater mean reductions
were observed in patients aged > 75 years (ÿ13.6
mmhg) than in those aged , 75 years (ÿ10.7 mmhg).

the proportion of  xxxd3303xxx -treated patients who
achieved the target supine diastolic blood pressure of
, 90 mmhg was independent of age; 62 (63%) out of
98 patients aged , 75 years and 24 (63%) out of 38
patients aged > 75 years responded to  xxxd3303xxx . in
comparison, the response rate to enalapril was higher in
the older patient group; 61 (59%) out of 104 patients
aged , 75 years and 23 (72%) out of 32 patients aged
> 75 years responded.
slightly greater mean reductions in supine diastolic
blood pressure were observed in female than in male
patients for both treatment groups (table 2). the
adjusted mean reduction from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure at trough was ÿ13.8 mmhg for
females and ÿ11.4 mmhg for males in the  xxxd3303xxx 
group and ÿ12.2 mmhg for females and ÿ10.3 mmhg
for males in the enalapril group. similarly, a slightly
higher proportion of female patients than male patients
achieved the target supine diastolic blood pressure of
, 90 mmhg in each treatment group.
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring

a total of 76 male and 91 female patients, mean age
70.7 years, took part in the ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring substudy. baseline 24 h mean systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were 155.8 and 89.1 mmhg,
respectively. both  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril produced
signi®cant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, which were maintained throughout the 24 h
dosing interval (fig. 4). at the end of monotherapy in
week 12, the placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the 24 h mean systolic and diastolic blood
pressure was ÿ13.5 and ÿ6.7 mmhg, respectively, for
 xxxd3303xxx  (n  87), and ÿ13.6 and ÿ6.8 mmhg, respectively, for enalapril (n  76). both treatments provided similar reductions in daytime and night-time
mean blood pressure. the addition of hydrochlorothiazide produced further signi®cant reductions in both

placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in 24 h
mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were ÿ17.5
and ÿ9.3 mmhg, respectively, for  xxxd3303xxx  (n  79),
and ÿ18.4 and ÿ9.8 mmhg, respectively, for enalapril
(n  68).
quality of life

all eight scales of the quality-of-life questionnaire
showed high scores at baseline, which is consistent with
a patient population having mild to moderate hypertension. the median of each scale did not change from

baseline for either treatment regimen when assessed at
the end of the study.
safety

for both treatment groups, 98 (71%) out of 139 patients
reported one or more adverse events at some point
during the 26-week double-blind treatment period. of
these, only 35 (25%) patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group
and 52 (37%) patients in the enalapril group suffered
adverse events that were considered by the investigator
to be related to treatment (table 3). the incidence of
treatment-related coughing was more than twice as

the incidence of treatment-related vertigo was higher
in patients treated with enalapril (3.6%) than in those
treated with  xxxd3303xxx  (0.7%). the incidence of diarrhea was somewhat higher in the  xxxd3303xxx  group
(4.3%) than in the enalapril group (2.2%). the addition
of hydrochlorothiazide to the treatment regimen did
not appear to change the safety pro®le of either
 xxxd3303xxx  or enalapril.
there were 18 serious adverse events during the
double-blind treatment; of these, ®ve were considered
by the investigator to be related to treatment. in the
 xxxd3303xxx  group one patient had glaucoma while
taking the 20 mg dose and one patient had strabismus
while taking the 40 mg dose. in the enalapril group,
one patient experienced dizziness, vertigo and chest
pain while taking the 5 mg dose, one experienced
constipation while taking the 10 mg dose and one
patient suffered a stroke while taking the 20 mg dose.
in addition, one patient developed severe disabling
quincke's angioneurotic edema 24 days after starting
treatment with enalapril.
there were no clinically signi®cant differences between treatment regimens with respect to the incidence
of laboratory values outside the normal range, new or
worse ®ndings by ecg or physical examination, or
orthostatic changes during measurement of vital signs.
there were no relevant changes in median values for
any laboratory parameter in either treatment group and
none of the patients withdrew because of a laboratorymeasured event.

discussion

the primary and secondary outcomes used in this
study demonstrate that the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3303xxx  was at least as effective as the ace
inhibitor enalapril in achieving blood pressure control
in elderly hypertensive patients. both regimens produced clinically meaningful reductions in both supine
systolic and diastolic blood pressure without signi®cantly affecting the pulse rate. similarly, a comparable
number of patients responded to each treatment regimen, whether measured by those patients achieving a
target supine diastolic blood pressure of , 90 mmhg
or by also including those patients whose supine
diastolic blood pressure had been lowered by at least
10 mmhg from baseline. overall, 71% of patients
responded to  xxxd3303xxx  and 68% to enalapril, when
assessed by the number of patients with a supine
diastolic blood pressure of , 90 mmhg or a reduction
from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure of
> 10 mmhg.
the number of patients who achieved blood pressure
control increased as the dose of  xxxd3303xxx  or enalapril
was titrated upward. by the end of monotherapy at
week 12, 57% patients had responded to 20±80 mg
 xxxd3303xxx  and 49% to 5±20 mg enalapril.
plasma renin levels were measured at baseline and
again after 12 weeks of monotherapy. overall plasma
renin levels were low, the majority of patients ful®lling
the criteria of low-renin hypertension [22]. however,
these low values are compatible with plasma renin
levels in an elderly population, since it is well known
that renin levels decrease with age. both treatments
induced an increase in plasma renin of 0:8 ng=ml per h.
these changes are caused by the abolition, by differing
mechanisms, of the negative feedback induced by
 xxxg99xxx  on renin secretion.
it is well established that the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to either ace inhibitor or  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist therapy can improve blood pressure control
and increase the number of patients who achieve target
diastolic blood pressure levels without reducing tolerability [23,24]. in those patients in the present study
who did not achieve blood pressure control while on
monotherapy, the addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide reduced supine diastolic blood pressure by a mean
of approximately 6.6 mmhg in both treatment groups.
as a result, 44% of patients who did not respond to
 xxxd3303xxx  monotherapy and 49% of those who did not
respond to enalapril monotherapy achieved the target
supine diastolic blood pressure with combination therapy. a further reduction in mean diastolic blood
pressure and an increase in the number of patients
responding to treatment was noted among patients
titrated to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.

 xxxd3303xxx  in elderly hypertensives karlberg et al. 301

the administration of  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril once a
day produced an effective blood pressure fall over the
entire 24 h dosing interval (fig. 4). in the ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring substudy, the placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in mean daytime systolic
and diastolic blood pressure were only slightly greater
than the reductions in the corresponding night-time
blood pressures, both in week 12 at the end of monotherapy and in week 26 at the end of the study. as
 xxxd3303xxx  has a long mean half-life of approximately
24 h and a trough : peak ratio of more than 80% [17], a
sustained blood pressure effect can be expected over a
24 h period. in a comparison with amlodipine, a better
blood pressure response was found for  xxxd3303xxx  over
the last 4 h of the night [25]. a similar study with
losartan, another  xxxg100xxx  antagonist, showed a
signi®cantly lower diastolic blood pressure during the
last 6 h of the night for the  xxxd3303xxx  group compared
with losartan [26]. in this respect, no difference between
 xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril was seen in the present study.
a single daily dose is desirable because it may be
associated with higher patient compliance with taking
medication. the results of the present study support
the administration of  xxxd3303xxx  once a day.
in a previous study, losartan was compared with
enalapril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with hydrochlorothiazide added if necessary to
achieve blood pressure control [27]. a small subgroup
of patients aged > 65 years were assessed separately. in
these elderly patients, the mean change from baseline
in diastolic blood pressure with losartan was signi®cantly greater than that for patients treated with
enalapril. no difference in antihypertensive effect between the two drugs was seen in the present study.
however, the clearance of enalapril is known to be
reduced with age [28], and even more so if hydrochlorothiazide is added [29], resulting in a higher serum
concentration of the active drug. a greater blood
pressure fall has also been reported in healthy elderly
subjects compared with younger patients [30], indicating that elderly patients may respond differently to
enalapril than younger patients. it is not the increased
age itself, but rather a reduced renal function that
results in the differences in handling [31]. furthermore,
in elderly hypertensive patients with a history of ace
inhibitor-induced cough, 50 mg losartan produced a
signi®cantly lower incidence of cough than the ace
inhibitor lisinopril  xxxd1891xxx  mg [8]. the present ®ndings
are in accord with these results; at1 antagonists appear
to be comparable to ace inhibitors in the blood
pressure fall obtained in elderly patients with mild to
moderate hypertension, but at1 antagonists produce
less treatment-related cough.
the patients who participated in the present study had

high quality-of-life scores at baseline, which is consistent with the expectations for a population with mild to
moderate hypertension. no decrease in the median
quality-of-life score was detected, which suggests that
both treatment regimens were well tolerated by these
patients.
the incidence of adverse events was similar for  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril. however, more that twice as many
patients taking enalapril experienced treatment-related
cough as an adverse event. as many as 20% of patients
treated with ace inhibitors experience a persistent,
nonproductive cough, which is believed to be caused
by an accumulation of bradykinin at cough receptors in
the airways [3,4]. this re¯ects the multiple actions of
ace, which mediates not only the conversion of
 xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx , but it is identical to
 xxxg36xxx , which causes bradykinin breakdown.
therefore, ace inhibitors also inhibit bradykinin metabolism, whereas at1 antagonists are selective and do
not affect bradykinin. the reduced incidence of cough
with  xxxd3303xxx  relative to enalapril is consistent with
®ndings for other at1 antagonists [6,8,9].
in summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  is at
least as effective as the ace inhibitor enalapril,
whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, in elderly patients with
mild to moderate hypertension. clinically meaningful
reductions in blood pressure were achieved in patients
aged 65±74 years and in those aged > 75 years, in both
male and female patients. whereas both treatments
were well tolerated,  xxxd3303xxx  was associated with a
lower incidence of treatment-related cough than enalapril. the results of the present study and of other
clinical studies indicate that  xxxd3303xxx  is an effective
and well-tolerated treatment for elderly as well as
younger patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
