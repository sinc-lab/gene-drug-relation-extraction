abstract the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs—azathioprine (aza), 6mercaptopurine ( xxxd2573xxx ), and  xxxd3352xxx —are widely used
to treat malignancies, rheumatic diseases, dermatologic
conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, and solid organ
transplant rejection. however,  xxxd2573xxx  drugs have a
relatively narrow therapeutic index and are capable of
causing life-threatening toxicity, most often myelosuppression.  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ;  xxxg2319xxx ),
an enzyme that catalyzes s-methylation of these drugs,
exhibits a genetic polymorphism in 10% of caucasians,
with 1/300 individuals having complete deficiency. patients
with intermediate or deficient  xxxg2319xxx  activity are at risk for
excessive toxicity after receiving standard doses of  xxxd2573xxx  medications. this report reviews the recent advances
in the knowledge of the mechanism of action as well as the
molecular basis and interethnic variations of  xxxg2319xxx  and
 xxxg1213xxx  ( xxxg1213xxx ;  xxxg1213xxx ),
another enzyme implicated in  xxxd2573xxx  toxicity. in addition,
an update on pharmacokinetics, metabolism, drug-drug
interactions, safety, and tolerability of  xxxd2573xxx  drugs is
provided.

the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs—azathioprine (aza),  xxxd2573xxx 
( xxxd2573xxx ), and 6- xxxd3352xxx  ( xxxd3352xxx )—are effective in a variety
of clinical conditions. they are commonly used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease (ibd), hematological malignancies, and in
transplantation. the indications where  xxxd2573xxx  analogues
have found considerable use are listed in table 1.
aza and  xxxd2573xxx  are purine analogues that act as
antagonists to the endogenous purines that are essential

components of dna, rna, and some coenzymes. initially
evaluated for the treatment of leukemia in the 1950s,  xxxd2573xxx 
and its prodrug aza were introduced in the 1960s as
immunosuppressants for organ transplantation. the earliest
reported use of thiopurines for ibd was a 1962 paper
describing successful treatment of ulcerative colitis with
 xxxd2573xxx  [11]. this was followed by further clinical observations of  xxxd2573xxx  therapy in ibd and, eventually, by
controlled clinical trials [21]. the use of thiopurines in the
treatment of ibd has been discussed in two recent review
articles [20, 22]. thiopurines are now considered standard
of care for crohn’s disease, despite the absence of
regulatory approvals. they have been shown to be effective
in induction (as an adjunct to steroids or infliximab) and
maintenance of remission [23]. in ulcerative colitis, they are
recommended in acute treatment of patients who have mild
to moderate extensive disease that is not responsive to oral
corticosteroids and as steroid-sparing maintenance therapy
[24]. also, aza and  xxxd2573xxx  have been shown to be useful in
maintaining remission in patients with more severe disease
[24]. in some patients, fistula closure has been observed
and reopening developed with drug discontinuation.

mechanisms of action
thiopurines can exert a cytotoxic effect in multiple
ways. thiopurines are prodrugs that require activation
by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( xxxg1075xxx ;
 xxxg1075xxx ) to exert a cytotoxic effect [25]. metabolism of 6tg by  xxxg1075xxx  produces 6-thioguanosine 5′-monophosphate
(tgmp), which is further metabolized by a series of kinases
and reductases to produce deoxy-6-thioguanosine 5′ triphosphate (dgs). incorporation of dgs into dna has been shown
to trigger cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by a process that
involves the mismatch repair pathway [26]. cytotoxicity is

cell cycle-specific for the s-phase of the cell cycle. the
delayed cytotoxicity of  xxxd2573xxx  (mp) in p388 murine
leukemic cells was found to be compatible with the mitotic
death caused by dna damage due to incorporation of tg
into dna as tg nucleotide. the mp-treated leukemic cell
demonstrated morphological changes of cell size enlargement
and multinucleated nuclei. as a result of these findings,
mitotic cell death may be a mechanism of mp for killing the
cycling cells from residual dormant leukemic cells in g0 or
long g1 phases in the treatment of childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [27].
in addition to being activated by biotransformation,
 xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd3352xxx  are eliminated by biotransformation to
inactive metabolites. mp is catabolized by  xxxg2431xxx 
(ec 1.17.3.2) to thiouric acid, which is the primary
metabolite identified in plasma and urine following mp
administration [28, 29]. another competing pathway is
s-methylation of  xxxd2573xxx  to 6-methylmercaptopurine (6mmp) by  xxxd2573xxx  methyl transferase ( xxxg2319xxx ).  xxxg2319xxx 
represents the predominant inactivation pathway of thiopurines in hematopoietic cells; thus, patients who inherit  xxxg2319xxx 
deficiency accumulate excessive concentrations of the active
tg nucleotides in blood cells when treated with conventional doses of these medications.
the metabolism of  xxxd2573xxx  to tgmp is less direct than
that of  xxxd3352xxx , involving two additional enzymes, inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh; e.c.1.1.1.205)
and  xxxd1067xxx  synthase ( xxxg920xxx ;
ec 6.3.4.1). this difference is potentially important because
the intermediate of the aza/ xxxd2573xxx  pathway, thioinosine
monophosphate, can act as a substrate for  xxxg2319xxx , leading to
the production of s-methyl-thioinosine 5′-monophosphate
(6-me-thio-imp) as shown in fig. 1. 6-me-thio-imp is a
strong inhibitor of purine de novo synthesis (pdns) [30,
31]. inhibition of pdns is a well-established protocol to
achieve immunosuppression and to block proliferation of
various types of lymphocyte lines [32]. thus it seems likely
that significant pdns inhibition by metimp can be
achieved in vivo after oral thiopurines and can contribute
to the cytotoxic action of aza/ xxxd2573xxx  [33].
the mechanism of action of thiopurines in treating ibd
is not completely characterized. as shown in fig. 1, both
 xxxd2573xxx  and aza are converted to active metabolites,  xxxd3352xxx 
nucleotides (6-tgn). 6-tgn is incorporated into cellular
nucleic acids, resulting in inhibition of nucleotide and
protein synthesis and ultimately in inhibition of lymphocyte
proliferation [25]. investigators have shown that the
mechanism of action of aza and  xxxd2573xxx  may include
increased apoptosis (or programmed cell death) of activated
t-lymphocytes. aza or  xxxd2573xxx  therapy results in accumulation of 6-tgn in lymphocytes. in the presence of t-cell
activation, as occurs in immunologically driven diseases,
6-tgn blocks the expression of trail, tnfrs7, and

[34]. lamina propria t-cells in patients with ibd demonstrate increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis, leading
to t-cell accumulation in the gut and recruitment of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes culminating in epithelial
cell destruction. [35–37].
another report described the role of aza and its
metabolites in the control of t-cell apoptosis by modulation
of rac1 activation upon cd28 costimulation. specific
blockade of rac1 activation is achieved by aza-generated
6-thio-gtp that binds to rac1 instead of gtp. consequently, the activation of rac1 target genes such as mek,
 xxxg1559xxx , and  xxxg251xxx  is suppressed by aza, leading to a
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. aza thus converts a
costimulatory signal into an apoptotic signal by modulating
rac1 activity. these findings may explain the beneficial
immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine and have important implications for the design of novel specific therapies for
organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. this mechanism may be particularly important in autoimmune and
chronic inflammatory diseases that rely on pathogenic
memory t-cells [38].

 xxxd2573xxx  pharmacokinetics and metabolism
aza is approximately 50%  xxxd2573xxx  by molecular
weight, and about 88% of aza is converted to  xxxd2573xxx . the
oral bioavailability of aza ranges from 27 to 83% and that
of  xxxd2573xxx  from 5 to 37%; bioavailability is inversely proportional to the oral dose [39, 40]. estimates of bioavailability
are based on measurements of  xxxd2573xxx  because intact aza is
undetectable after oral administration due to conversion in
the red blood cells (rbc) before hepatic metabolism. a

conversion factor of 2 is typically used when calculating
equivalent oral doses of the two agents (e.g., 1 mg of  xxxd2573xxx 
is equivalent to 2 mg of aza). after absorption, the
prodrug aza undergoes approximately 90% conversion to
 xxxd2573xxx  by non-enzymatic attack by sulphydryl-containing
compounds such as glutathione or cysteine that are present
in every mammalian cell.
as analogues of hypoxanthine and guanine, mp and tg
are anabolized and catabolized through many of the same
enzymatic pathways as endogenous purines [28, 41]. one
important difference between the thiopurines and the
naturally occurring purines is that both tg and mp are
substrates for  xxxg2319xxx  [42, 43], which catabolizes mp and
tg to 6-methyl-mp and 6-methyl-tg. thiouric acid is the
principal catabolite of mp and tg found in urine [28, 29]. mp
is converted to thioxanthine and thiouric acid by xanthine
oxidase [32]. when the  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor allopurinol is administered with oral mp, plasma mp concentrations
are fivefold higher, and the toxicity of mp is enhanced [44,
45]. the nucleoside metabolite mp-riboside is a minor
circulating metabolite of mp [46]. tg is not a substrate for
 xxxg2431xxx  [47], thus when allopurinol and tg are
administered simultaneously, there is no known drug
interaction.
in a pediatric phase 1 trial and pharmacokinetic study of
tg administered as a continuous i.v. infusion [48] and an
earlier study of i.v. tg [49], an unknown metabolite was
detected in plasma. pharmacokinetic modeling of the data
suggested that tg was eliminated by a capacity-limited
(saturable) elimination mechanism. the enzymatic conversion of tg to the unknown metabolite may be the ratelimiting step in the elimination of tg from plasma [48]. this
metabolite was later identified as 8-hydroxy- xxxd3352xxx 
(8-oh-tg), and data were provided to suggest that its

756

formation is catalyzed by  xxxg168xxx  (ao; ec:1.2.3.1).
thus there are two potential pathways for thiouric acid
formation from tg (see fig. 2):
1.  xxxg880xxx  (gd;  xxxg880xxx ) converts tg to
thioxanthine [50], which is then converted to thiouric
acid by  xxxg2431xxx .
2.  xxxg168xxx  converts tg to 8-hydroxy-tg [51],
which is then converted to thiouric acid by xanthine
oxidase.
another metabolic pathway of mp and tg involves
anabolic transformation by the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
transferase ( xxxg1075xxx ) to the active metabolites  xxxd3352xxx 
nucleotides (6-tgn), which are incorporated into dna,
ultimately resulting in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.
the pro-apoptotic nucleotide 6-gtp may be related to
phosphorylation of the final nucleotide in the activation
pathway. the plasma half-life of the biologically active
6-tgn metabolites is several days or more [52], and steadystate concentrations of these nucleotides have been reported
after 2–4 weeks of oral aza at 2mg/kg per day [40]. this
provides the rationale for once-daily dosing and the delayed
onset of action. efficacy may appear as early as 8 weeks, but
most clinicians feel the typical onset of efficacy is about
12 weeks [53]. the slow accumulation of 6-tgn in the cells
may partially explain the delayed onset of action. the plasma
kinetics of aza,  xxxd2573xxx  and 6-tgn show wide interindividual variation [25, 39, 54].
administration of food significantly reduces the plasma
exposure of  xxxd3352xxx  in children with acute lymboblastic
leukemia. however, there were no differences in the
concentrations of the metabolite 6-tgn in rbc, probably
indicating a lack of clinical significance for the food effect
[54]. higher levels of methylated mp metabolites were
observed in rbc after once-daily administration of oral mp
in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to

twice-daily administration. however, there were no significant differences in tgn levels between the two dosing
regimens [55].
thiopurines do not induce  xxxg2319xxx . however,  xxxg2319xxx 
expression decreased during  xxxd2573xxx  treatment, but no
change in enzyme activity was observed [56]. organic
anion transporter-3 (oatp3) has been shown to be an
efflux transporter of thiopurines across the blood-brain
barrier resulting in limited distribution in the brain [57].
this may be a reason for cns relapses during antileukemia
treatment.
concentrations of 6-tgn and 6-mmp were not detected
in blood of infants breast-fed by women taking aza [58].
a recent study showed that concentrations of  xxxd2573xxx  were
not detected in the breast milk of women on aza treatment
[59]. concentrations of 6-tgn and 6-mmp were not
measured in this study. while the exposure to  xxxd2573xxx 
metabolites in infants appears to be negligible, the safety of
thiopruine in breast-feeding remains largely unknown.

 xxxg2319xxx —genetic polymorphism
 xxxd2573xxx  drugs have a relatively narrow therapeutic index
and are capable of causing life-threatening toxicity, most
often myelosuppression [25]. individual differences in tgn
accumulation after drug therapy have been shown to be
associated with bone marrow toxicity and in the case of
 xxxd2573xxx , its antileukemic effects [60–62]. in the 1980s, large
interindividual differences were reported in  xxxg2319xxx  activity,
which was found to be inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion. when individuals with low or undetectable
 xxxg2319xxx  activity received standard doses of aza, they had
elevated concentrations of the active metabolites 6-tgn
and drug-induced myelosuppression [63, 64]. because
 xxxg2319xxx  reduces the available pool of  xxxd2573xxx  for
conversion to 6-tgn,  xxxg2319xxx  activity is inversely correlated

with levels of the active metabolites of  xxxd2573xxx . this
phenomenon was first observed in children treated with
aza for leukemia [65] and was recently confirmed among
pediatric patients receiving  xxxd2573xxx  for ibd [66]. this inverse
correlation has important patient care implications from
both efficacy and safety perspectives. patients with high
functional  xxxg2319xxx  activity may convert the majority of
 xxxd2573xxx  into 6-mmp with inadequate production of 6-tgns
to provide therapeutic efficacy.
the hereditary nature of the  xxxg2319xxx  deficiency in humans
was initially identified by weinshilboum and sladek in
1980 in a study of  xxxg2319xxx  activity in rbc [67]. distribution
of  xxxg2319xxx  activity in rbc is considered to be trimodal in
large populations studied to date: approximately 90% of
individuals have high activity, 10% have intermediate
activity, and 0.3% have low or no detectable enzyme
activity [68–70]. patients with intermediate activity are
heterozygous at the  xxxg2319xxx  gene locus, and the tpmtdeficient subjects are homozygous for low activity alleles,
as determined by molecular genetic and familial studies.
the cellular accumulation of tgn nucleotides is inversely
proportional to  xxxg2319xxx  activity, since high  xxxg2319xxx  activity
shunts more drugs down the methylation pathway, leaving
less for activation to cytotoxic tgns [68–70]. conversely,
 xxxg2319xxx -deficient patients accumulate very high tgn concentrations in tissues, including rbc [60, 62]. in addition,
it has been shown that the evolution of  xxxg2319xxx  activity
correlates with both short- and long-term results after renal
transplantation [71]. erythrocyte  xxxg2319xxx  activity correlates
with  xxxg2319xxx  in other cells and tissues and is a convenient
assay for enzyme activity [72]. determination of the
patient’s  xxxg2319xxx  genotype or phenotype, a priori, can
identify the rare patient (1 in 300) who should not receive
a  xxxd2573xxx  because of little or no  xxxg2319xxx  enzyme activity,
placing the patient at risk for potentially fatal complications
of severe neutropenia. patients with intermediate  xxxg2319xxx 
levels can safely receive thiopurines at lower doses (30–50%
of the standard dose) and can undergo dose escalation safely
under close monitoring. thiopurines provide an excellent
example of the successful use of pharmacogenetics to
individualize human drug therapy [73, 74].
 xxxg2319xxx  was first partially purified and characterized by
woodson and weinshilboum in 1983 [75, 76]. it is encoded
by a 27-kb gene on human chromosome 6p22.3 [68, 69, 77].
 xxxg2319xxx  has ten exons, eight of which encode the 28-kda
protein. seventeen variant  xxxg2319xxx  alleles have been identified to date (table 2), including three alleles ( xxxg2319xxx *2,
 xxxg2319xxx *3a, and  xxxg2319xxx *3c) that account for 80–95% of
intermediate or low enzyme activity [78–83]. the first
identified variant allele,  xxxg2319xxx *2, contains a single nucleotide transversion (g238c) leading to the substitution of a
rigid proline for a more flexible alanine residue at codon 80
(ala>pro) [84]. as a result, the tertiary structure of the

 xxxg2319xxx  protein is changed, leading to protein instability and
decreased catalytic activity.  xxxg2319xxx *3a, the most common
variant allele responsible for low  xxxg2319xxx  activity in whites,
encodes a protein with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp), g460a in exon 7 and a719g in exon 10,
leading to amino acid substitutions at codon 154 (ala>thr)
and codon 240 (tyr>cys) [81].  xxxg2319xxx *3c allele is more
frequently identified in african and southeast asian
populations [85, 86].
when heterologously expressed in yeast or cos-1 cells,
 xxxg2319xxx *3a had more than 200-fold lower  xxxg2319xxx  activity
and immunodetectable protein compared to wild-type
cdna [81]. heterologous expression in yeast established
an enhanced rate of proteolysis of mutant  xxxg2319xxx  proteins
encoded by  xxxg2319xxx *2 and  xxxg2319xxx *3a alleles, with degradation half-lives of ∼15 min for both mutant proteins compared with 18 h for the wild-type protein [81]. subsequent
studies also established that  xxxg2319xxx *3b and  xxxg2319xxx *3c
proteins have an enhanced rate of proteolysis when expressed
in mammalian cells [87], consistent with the lower protein
levels in individuals who inherit these alleles [88].
the mutant alleles  xxxg2319xxx *4–8 have also been identified
during clinical genotype-phenotype analysis, but the molecular mechanism underlying the low activity has not been
thoroughly evaluated for these variants.  xxxg2319xxx *4 has a
g>a transition at the intron 9–exon 10 junction, which

758

disrupts the final nucleotide of the intron at the 3′ acceptor
splice site sequence [78, 79].  xxxg2319xxx *5 was identified as a
t146c transition in a heterozygous individual of undefined
ethnicity who had intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity [78]. this
mutation results in a leu>ser amino acid substitution at
codon 49.  xxxg2319xxx *6 was identified in a korean subject with
intermediate activity [78]. this a539t transversion in exon
8 results in a tyr>phe substitution at codon 180.  xxxg2319xxx *7
was identified in a single european subject with intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity [80]. this allele contains a t681g
transversion in exon 10, which results in a his>glu amino
acid substitution at codon 227.  xxxg2319xxx *8 contains a single
nucleotide transition (g644a) leading to an amino acid
change at codon 215 (arg>his) [89]. this allele has been
identified in one heterozygous african-american individual
with intermediate activity.
in another study, dna samples from four leucopenic
patients treated with aza were screened by pcr-sscp
analysis for mutations in the ten exons of the  xxxg2319xxx  gene
[90]. four missense mutations, a83t ( xxxg2319xxx *13, glu>val
at codon 28), c374t ( xxxg2319xxx *12, ser>leu at codon 125),
g430c ( xxxg2319xxx *10, gly>arg at codon 144) and t681g
( xxxg2319xxx *7, his>gln at codon 227) were identified.
 xxxg2319xxx *11 is associated with deficient activity and was
identified in a 5-year-old boy with all [62]. in a study
conducted in a large population of german caucasians,
four novel variants ( xxxg2319xxx *9,  xxxg2319xxx *16,  xxxg2319xxx *17,
 xxxg2319xxx *18) were identified leading to amino acid changes
(k119t, q42e, r163h, g71r, prbc). two novel sequence
variants were identified in highly conserved nucleotide
positions of the human  xxxg2319xxx  gene, resulting in a loss of
enzyme activity [91], when comparing the phenotype with
the genotype in swedish patients with ibd and healthy
individuals. an a>g transition in the start codon was
identified (exon iii, 1a>g, met>val,  xxxg2319xxx *14) in one of
the patients and her father. the mother in this family carried
the 460g>a and 719a>g nucleotide substitutions ( xxxg2319xxx *
1/*3a). in the second family, sequencing revealed a g>a
transition in the acceptor splice site in intron vii/exon viii
(ivs7 – 1g>a,  xxxg2319xxx *15) in the patient and his mother.
in addition to the  xxxg2319xxx  mutant alleles described above,
variable-number tandem repeats (vntr3 to vntr9) have
been identified in the promoter region of the  xxxg2319xxx  gene.
significance of occurrence of the vntrs is controversial.
a few studies suggest a high number of vntr repeats or
specific combinations may be weakly associated with lower
 xxxg2319xxx  activity [92–95]. however, investigation of genetic
determinants in british asians and caucasians with
intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity suggested that vntr variation
in the 5′-untranslated region of the  xxxg2319xxx  gene does not
significantly modulate  xxxg2319xxx  activity [96].

evidence of severe bone marrow toxicity, particularly
myelosuppression [97].

 xxxg2319xxx —ethnic distribution of mutant alleles
in studies conducted in various ethnic groups around the
world, predominant variant alleles identified were  xxxg2319xxx *3c,
*3a, and *2, which accounted for over 95% of inherited
 xxxg2319xxx  deficiency (table 3). based on the population
genotype-phenotype studies performed to date, assays for
the molecular diagnosis of  xxxg2319xxx  deficiency have focused
on mutant alleles  xxxg2319xxx *2,  xxxg2319xxx *3a, and  xxxg2319xxx *3c. in
most of these studies, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was used to detect
mutations in the  xxxg2319xxx  alleles.
a high degree of concordance was demonstrated
between  xxxg2319xxx  genotype and phenotype in caucasians
[83, 114]. the presence of mutant alleles is predictive of
the phenotype. heterozygous patients have intermediate
activity, and homozygous patients have low activity, although
a variability can be seen between these groups [69, 86, 115,
116]. african-american subjects also have a frequency
distribution similar to that of caucasian-american subjects,
but with an average level of activity that is 17% lower [70].
in addition, a trimodal allelic distribution has been shown in
caucasians in contrast to southeast asians who apparently
have a unimodal distribution [68, 70, 85, 109, 117]. this
may be due to the absence, or very low frequency, among
southeast asians of  xxxg2319xxx *3a, the most common variant
allele in caucasians, although the *3c allele is present in
southeast asian subjects [109].  xxxg2319xxx *3c is the predominant  xxxg2319xxx  mutant allele in african and african-american
populations, whereas the only mutant allele identified to date
in southwest asians (indian, pakistani) is  xxxg2319xxx *3a [85].
the  xxxg2319xxx *3c allele (a719g), with a frequency of 1.0%,
has been shown in several other ethnic groups including the
kenyans, ghanaians, chinese, japanese, thai and brazilian
(table 3). in addition, this is the only variant allele found in
many southeast asian and african populations (table 3).
 xxxg2319xxx *3c is also the predominant deficiency-associated
allele reported in a saami (“lapp”) population from northern
scandinavia. the saami population has a trimodal frequency
distribution, but the average level of activity is approximately
29% higher than in “southern” norwegians [118]. other
variant alleles have been observed in very few individuals. in
some cases, they appeared in only a single person, which led
to the suggestion that the variant nucleotide may be a
mutation and not a true polymorphism [119].
several studies focused on  xxxg2319xxx  genotype-phenotype
relationship, and overall concordance rates from different
population studies range from 76 to 99%. especially in the

case of intermediate metabolizers, the correlation is much
less, as confirmed by two recent studies in argentine and
bulgarian populations [104, 105]. here, only 57 and 63% of
intermediate methylators, respectively, could be explained
by known  xxxg2319xxx  alleles, even after considering rare alleles
(e.g., *4, *6, *8). moreover, some clinical studies have
failed to demonstrate a homozygous mutant genotype in
patients with  xxxd2573xxx -related severe hematotoxicity and
very low  xxxg2319xxx  activity [120, 121]. these genotype–
phenotype discrepancies could be explained by the possible
influence of genetic factors involving regulatory elements
of the  xxxg2319xxx  gene or other loci as well as with epigenetic
factors such as  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition by concomitant drugs.

 xxxg1213xxx —genetic polymorphism
the majority of adverse drug reactions to aza are not
explained by  xxxg2319xxx  deficiency. most recently, genetic
polymorphisms have also been identified in the gene
regulating  xxxg1213xxx  ( xxxg1213xxx ;
ec3.6.1.19) enzyme. this enzyme phosphorylates the
intermediary metabolite timp to 6-thioinosine triphosphate, which may compete with, or have similar proapoptotic properties as, 6-gtp [122].  xxxd2573xxx  is activated through
a 6-thio-imp intermediate and, in  xxxg1213xxx -deficient patients,
potentially toxic 6-thio-itp is predicted to accumulate
(fig. 3) [123]. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1213xxx  gene may

account for non– xxxg2319xxx -related adverse effects from aza/
 xxxd2573xxx  therapy such as influenza-like symptoms, rash, and
pancreatitis.
 xxxg1213xxx  catalyzes the pyrophosphohydrolysis of inosine
triphosphate (itp) to  xxxd557xxx  (imp) and is
encoded by  xxxg1213xxx  gene on chromosome 20p. to date, five
single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified,
three silent (138g→a, 561g→a, 708g→a) and two associated with  xxxg1213xxx  deficiency (94c→a, ivs2+21a→c)
[124]. homozygotes for the 94c→a missense mutation
(pro32 to thr) had zero erythrocyte  xxxg1213xxx  activity,
whereas 94c→a heterozygotes averaged 22.5% of the
control mean.  xxxg1213xxx  activity of ivs2+21a→c homozygotes averaged 60% of the control mean. in order to
explore further the relationship between mutations and
enzyme activity, the association between genotype and
 xxxg1213xxx  activity was examined in 100 healthy caucasians.
ten subjects were heterozygous for 94c→a (allele frequency: 0.06), 24 were heterozygotes for ivs2+21a→c
(allele frequency: 0.13) and two were compound heterozygous for these mutations. the activities of ivs2+21a→c
heterozygotes and 94c→a/ivs2+21a→c compound heterozygotes were 60 and 10%, respectively, of the normal
control mean, suggesting that the intron mutation affects
enzyme activity. in all cases when  xxxg1213xxx  activity was
below the normal range, one or both mutations were found.
the  xxxg1213xxx  genotype did not correspond to any identifiable
rbc phenotype.
in another study, a possible relationship between  xxxg1213xxx 
deficiency and increased drug toxicity of purine analogue
drugs was investigated in patients treated for ibd [123]. a
significant association between aza-related adverse drug
reactions and the  xxxg1213xxx  94c→a polymorphism was
observed. the majority of patients with  xxxg1213xxx  94c→a
alleles were heterozygous, a genotype associated with 25%
residual rbc  xxxg1213xxx  activity. by contrast,  xxxg1213xxx  ivs2+
21a→c genotypes were not associated with adverse drug
reactions. carriers of the  xxxg1213xxx  ivs2+21a→c polymorphism
have  xxxg1213xxx  activity in the normal range and homozygotes
have approximately 60% residual activity. only one of the
four  xxxg1213xxx  ivs2+21a→c homozygotes was in the adverse
drug reaction cohort, suggesting that this level of  xxxg1213xxx 
activity is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of toxic
 xxxd2573xxx  metabolites. results from a study conducted in
patients with ibd showed no significant association between
the  xxxg1213xxx  94c→a polymorphism and adverse effects from
 xxxd2573xxx  drugs [125]. there was no difference in the  xxxg1213xxx 
allele frequency between patients who had experienced an
adverse effect from a  xxxd2573xxx  drug and those who
tolerated a  xxxd2573xxx  drug. additionally, there is no
significant over-representation of the  xxxg1213xxx  94c→a polymorphism in any single adverse effect group, particularly
those experiencing flu-like symptoms, pancreatitis, or rash.

eur j clin pharmacol (2008) 64:753–767

frequencies of  xxxg1213xxx  polymorphisms in 100 healthy
japanese individuals was examined [122]. the allele frequency of the 94c→a variant in the japanese sample was
0.135 (caucasian allele frequency 0.06). the iv2+21a→c
polymorphism was not found in japanese (caucasian allele
frequency 0.130). allele frequencies of the 138g→a,
561g→a, and 708g→a polymorphisms were 0.57, 0.18,
and 0.06, respectively, in the japanese population, and with
the exception of the 138g→a polymorphism, similar to
allele frequencies in caucasians. it has been demonstrated
that proline-to-threonine substitution at codon 32 in the
 xxxg1213xxx  gene is found at low frequency in central/south
american populations (1–2%), at a constant frequency
across caucasian and african populations (6–7%), and is
highest in asian populations (14–19%) [126].

drug interactions
concomitant medications can alter the pharmacokinetics of
aza or  xxxd2573xxx  to a clinically significant degree and increase
the risk of adverse effects if therapies are not closely
monitored and appropriate adjustments made. allopurinol
inhibits first-pass metabolism of  xxxd2573xxx  by  xxxg2431xxx ,
resulting in fivefold increases in plasma mp and threefold
increases in steady-state erythrocyte 6-tgn concentrations,
according to one report [46]. concomitant methotrexate can
increase mp levels and the formation of active metabolites
via  xxxg2431xxx  inhibition and other mechanisms,
although the clinical significance of this effect is questionable [25]. these interactions are, however, of concern in
patients with ibd.
among agents used to treat ibd, the 5-aminosalicylates
cause in vitro inhibition of  xxxg2319xxx  [127], and a clinically
significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been reported
with  xxxd2781xxx  [128]. in a clinical study in patients with
ibd, the addition of aminosalicylates to ongoing aza or
 xxxd2573xxx  resulted in increases in whole-blood 6-tgn and a
high frequency of leucopenia [129]. both  xxxd2579xxx  and
 xxxd3255xxx  induced mild or moderate leukopenia in this
study, with  xxxd282xxx  having lesser effects. other studies
have also shown increases in  xxxd3352xxx  levels during combination therapy with  xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  [130]. since
 xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd2781xxx , and  xxxd3255xxx  are all relatively
potent inhibitors of  xxxg2319xxx  activity, careful monitoring of
blood counts is recommended in patients receiving concomitant therapy with  xxxd2573xxx .
interactions were observed between aza and infliximab
in treatment of crohn’s disease [131]. patients receiving
ongoing aza experienced transient increases in 6-tgn
levels and decreases in the mean leukocyte count in the
initial weeks following infliximab infusion, which returned
to previous pre-infliximab infusion levels after 3 months.

eur j clin pharmacol (2008) 64:753–767

increases in 6-tgn levels were predictive of clinical
response and good tolerance of infliximab and may have
been related to mucosal healing and improved absorption.
although not formally evaluated, other agents, e.g., corticosteroids, may have similar effects of increased absorption if
acute inflammation is improved in the proximal small bowel.
 xxxd2573xxx  has been reported to diminish the anticoagulant
effects of warfarin [132], and discontinuation of  xxxd2573xxx  has
led to bleeding in a patient previously stabilized on warfarin
[133]. the mechanism has not been fully explored, but
possible actions of  xxxd2573xxx  include induction of hepatic
enzymes that metabolize warfarin and induction of synthesis or activation of prothrombin [132].
the administration of  xxxd390xxx  and  xxxd3352xxx  in
combination is likely to be associated with the development
of nodular regenerative hyperplasia, with portal hypertension and esophageal varices occurring in a substantial
proportion of cases. in a randomized trial comparing  xxxd390xxx  with  xxxd390xxx  and  xxxd3352xxx , portal hypertension with
varices developed in 18/675 patients with chronic myeloid
leukaemia (cml). all 18 had received the drug combination and none received  xxxd390xxx  alone (p<0.0001) [134].
live virus and bacterial vaccines should not be administered to a patient receiving an immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent. at least 3 months should elapse between
the discontinuation of chemotherapy and vaccination with a
live vaccine. vaccination with a live vaccine in a patient
immunocompromised by a chemotherapeutic agent has
resulted in severe and fatal infections [135].
in recipients of renal implants, administration of azathioprine along with an  xxxg36xxx  (ace)
inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in hematocrit
and hemoglobin and in the development of severe anemia
[136]. however no pharmacokinetic interaction between
azathioprine and the ace inhibitor enalapril was observed
in renal transplant recipients [137]. the development of
anemia has been suggested to be causally linked to the
erythropoietin-lowering effect of ace inhibitors happening
as a result of feedback between erythropoietin and the
renin-angiotensin system [137].
inhibition of  xxxg2319xxx  activity by diuretics such as furosemide,  xxxd299xxx , and  xxxd3425xxx  has
been demonstrated in vitro [138]. furosemide has also been
shown to inhibit  xxxg2319xxx  activity in an ex-vivo study [139].
however, the clinical significance of inhibition by diuretics
is not known.
a recent study investigated the inhibitory potential of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) on human
 xxxg2319xxx  activity in vitro. naproxen,  xxxd2556xxx  acid, and
tolfenamic acid showed noncompetitive inhibition of
 xxxg2319xxx , while  xxxd3029xxx  derivatives (ibuprofen and
 xxxd2423xxx ) were weak inhibitors. these results indicate
possible interactions between thiopurines and nsaids.

safety and tolerability
thiopurines are associated with two categories of adverse
events: idiosyncratic (non–dose dependent, including allergic effects) and dose dependent. in most clinical trials, up to
25% of patients treated with purine antimetabolites have
non–dose-dependent side effects including nausea, fever,
rash, flu-like symptoms, and arthralgias that may require
dosing at night or discontinuation of therapy. these effects
may be partially accounted for by altered  xxxg1213xxx  enzyme
activity. nausea, fever, rash, flu-like symptoms, and
arthralgias can occur in patients who are rechallenged with
aza or  xxxd2573xxx  after an initial adverse reaction [123].
in a retrospective investigation of  xxxd2573xxx  safety and
tolerability in 396 patients, the incidence of pancreatitis was
3.3%, of allergic reactions (rash, fever, joint pain) 2%, and
of drug hepatitis 0.3% [140]. in a recent meta-analysis of
clinical trials encompassing 214 patients receiving aza or
 xxxd2573xxx , allergic reactions and pancreatitis occurred in 2.3 and
1.4% of patients, respectively [141].
mild leukopenia (3.0–4.0×109/l) is the most common
hematological side effect occurring with standard doses
(2.0 mg/kg) of aza [142]. studies have shown that a druginduced fall in the wbc count is associated with an
improved clinical outcome [143]. however, excessive bone
marrow suppression is the most common serious complication of aza treatment. myelosuppression has been
associated with high levels of 6-tgn. reported frequencies
in some of the larger patient populations investigated range
from about 2 to 15%, depending on how leukopenia is
defined [140, 142, 144]. in 27 years of observation at a
single hospital, leukopenia developed in 28 (3.8%) of 739
patients followed with monthly blood counts for the
duration of treatment with aza 2 mg/kg per day [142].
leukopenia was usually asymptomatic but was severe
(wbc counts <2,000/mul) in nine patients, of whom five
were symptomatic and two died of sepsis (other symptomatic illnesses were one case of pneumonia and two mild
upper respiratory infections).
in another patient population treated with  xxxd2573xxx , transient
myelosuppression was common and easily reversible
with dose reduction or temporary discontinuation [140].
the incidence of infectious complications in this patient
population was 7.4%, and severe infections, occurring in
1.8% of patients, were often associated with the use of
multiple immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids.
leukopenia was reported as an adverse event of  xxxd2573xxx 
therapy in 1.4% of patients included in the meta-analysis of
clinical trials [141]. in another report, leukopenia occurred
in 10 of 95 children monitored every 3 months during
treatment with aza or  xxxd2573xxx  and resolved without
sequelae, either spontaneously or with dose reduction or
drug discontinuation [144].

762

a substantial proportion of patients receiving thiopurines
experience mild elevations in transaminases that are
transient or reversible with dose reduction [66, 144, 145].
these elevations are often associated with flu-like symptoms such as fatigue or headache. although drug hepatitis
can occur as an early immune-mediated reaction to
thiopurines, these milder reactions appear to be related
both to the drug dose and individual variations in mp
metabolism. nodular regenerative hyperplasia and venoocclusive disease are other types of hepatotoxicity recently
described in patients treated with tg [146, 147]. these
reactions are seen far less frequently in patients with ibd
receiving aza or  xxxd2573xxx  [144, 148].
there is currently no evidence that  xxxd2573xxx  therapy
increases patients’ risk of malignancy. cancer incidence
was not elevated compared with population rates in two
large ibd cohorts, and the types of malignancies in patients
treated with thiopurines were not unusual [140, 142]. there
were no occurrences of cancer in the randomized clinical
trials covered in the meta-analysis [148]. in a large
retrospective cohort study from the uk, based on more
than 10,000 patients with ulcerative colitis and more than
6,600 with crohn’s disease, the incidence of lymphoma
was not elevated compared with controls without ibd
[149]. in a retrospective cohort study that included 454
incident cases of ibd in residents of olmstead county,
minnesota, during a 43-year period, the incidence of
lymphoma was identical to the background population
rate [150]. however, in a study from the mayo clinic,
 xxxd2573xxx  therapy for ibd was associated with a small but
statistically significant increase in risk of epstein-barr
virus-positive lymphoma [151].
reports from a trial, in which children were randomized
to receive oral  xxxd2573xxx  (75 mg/m2) or  xxxd3352xxx  (60 mg/m2) as
part of the maintenance regimen, described the occurrence
of veno-occlusive disease (vod) in approximately 20% of
patients in the  xxxd3352xxx  arm [152]. the development of vod
during  xxxd3352xxx  therapy was also observed in another study in
pediatric patients, and the subjects were switched to  xxxd2573xxx 
[153]. although  xxxd3352xxx  therapy showed higher rbc 6-tgn
concentrations and absence of cns relapses, the incidences of vod negatively affect the benefit-to-risk ratio with
 xxxd3352xxx .  xxxd3352xxx  in combination with  xxxd390xxx  chemotherapy
for chronic myeloid leukemia has been implicated in the
development of noncirrhotic or idiopathic portal hypertension. idiopathic portal hypertension was attributed to
nodular regenerative hyperplasia (nrh) of the liver.
another study reported a strong association between 6tg use and the subsequent development of nrh in
patients with ibd [146]. the authors concluded that the
toxicity profile of  xxxd3352xxx  outweighs its clinical efficacy and
 xxxd3352xxx  should not be considered as a therapy for patients
with ibd.

summary
the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs are used widely to treat malignancies,
rheumatic diseases, dermatologic conditions, inflammatory
bowel disease, and solid organ transplant rejection. as these
drugs have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, it is
important to recognize the risk factors that may lead to
toxicity, especially myeslosuppression. one risk factor is the
genetic polymorphism of the enzyme  xxxg2319xxx , which is
involved in the metabolism of the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs; patients
with intermediate or deficient  xxxg2319xxx  activity are at risk for
excessive toxicity after receiving standard doses of  xxxd2573xxx 
medications. recent insights into pharmacogenomics of
 xxxd2573xxx  drugs have led to labeling revisions.  xxxg2319xxx  testing
is now recommended for patients with clinical or laboratory
evidence of severe bone marrow toxicity, particularly myelosuppression. adverse drug reactions such as influenza-like
symptoms, rash, and pancreatitis are not explained by  xxxg2319xxx 
deficiency. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1213xxx  gene may account
for these non– xxxg2319xxx -related adverse effects.
adverse events and toxicities resulting from drug-drug
interactions are also a concern with  xxxd2573xxx  drugs. drugs
that inhibit  xxxg2319xxx  activity and alter the metabolism of
thiopurines should be avoided as concomitant medications.
live virus and bacterial vaccines should also be avoided in
patients receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic
agents. there is in vitro evidence of likely interaction
between thiopurines and other classes of drugs such as
diuretics and nsaids, and it would be useful to explore
these interactions in clinical studies as well.
