the effects
of tiaprofenic
acid
(tpa),
a nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drug
with
high
potency
as a cyclooxygenase
inhibitor,
on the metabolism
of normal
and degenerating
articular
cartilage
were
examined.
when
present
in the culture
medium
in clinically
relevant
concentrations
encompassing
those
achieved
in synovial
fluid
of patients
treated
with
the drug,
tpa had no significant
effects
on net proteoglycan
synthesis
in
organ
cultures
of normal,
osteoarthritic
or atrophic
canine
articular
cartilage.
when
fed
to dogs for 8 weeks
in a daily
dose of 100 mg, tpa had no apparent
effect
on cartilage
water
content
or uronic
acid
concentration.
the suppression
of net cartilage
proteoglycan synthesis
caused
by immobilization
was not affected
by administration
of tpa nor
did
the drug
affect
the proportion
of newly
synthesized
glycosaminoglycans
recovered
from
the spent
culture
medium,
suggesting
that it did not increase
proteoglycan
catabolism or affect
the integrity
of the cartilage
matrix.

in the

in the present

the degree of suppression

i.e., approximately

to a level

than that produced

alone,
and heightened
the decrease

despite
the suppression
of gag synthesis
caused
by immobilization,
the mean
uronic
acid concentration of atrophic
cartilage
in the present
study
was
normal
(table
i). in our previous
studies
on atrophic
cartilage,
the cartilage
uronic
acid concentration
was moderately
diminished.10
this difference
may
be due to the fact that in the current
study
the cast
was removed
every
few days
for skin
inspection,
whereas
in the previous
study
the cast was undisturbed
throughout
the period
of immobilization.
the uronic
acid concentration
of the oa cartilage
was higher
than that of the corresponding
ck cartilage, reflecting
the hypertrophic
repair
which
is a
common
feature
of this canine
model.21
the effects
of sal on joint cartilage
in the canine
model
of oa employed
herein
have
been
studied
extensively
and it has been
shown
that
sal suppresses
gag
synthesis
in oa cartilage
in vivo
as
well
as in vitro.14’22
thus,
in dogs that
were
fed
aspirin
daily
for 9 weeks
after acl transection,
the
articular
cartilage
degeneration
in the unstable
knee
was much
more
marked
than that in the oa knees
of dogs not treated
with aspirin.14
although
in vivo
effects
of tpa in the oa model
were not studied
in
the present
paper,
exposure
of canine
oa cartilage
to tpa in vitro
had no appreciable
effect
on gag
synthesis.

we did not directly
measure
gag catabolism
in
the present

the proportion
of 35sgags

in conclusion,
the present
studies
show that tpa,
in clinically
relevant
concentrations,
had no significant effect on gag synthesis
by normal
canine

in vitro and, when

to dogs during
