abstract
heparin as well as low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) have polypharmacological actions at various levels. earlier studies focused on the plasma anti-xa and anti-iia
pharmacodynamics (pd) for the different lmwhs. other important pd parameters for
heparin and lmwhs might explain the diverse clinical impacts of this class of agents in
thrombosis and beyond: the release of the vascular  xxxg2266xxx  ( xxxg2266xxx ),
inhibition of key matrix-degrading enzymes, and other mechanisms. there is much evidence for the key role of lmwhs in hypercoagulation in thrombosis and cancer,
angiogenesis, and inflammatory disorders. many cancer patients reportedly have a hypercoaguable state, with recurrent thrombosis due to the impact of cancer cells and chemotherapy or radiotherapy on the coagulation cascade. studies have demonstrated that
unfractionated heparin (ufh) or its low molecular weight fractions interfere with various
processes involved in tumor growth and metastasis. clinical trials have suggested a clinically relevant and improved efficacy of lmwhs, as compared to ufh, on the survival of
cancer patients with deep vein thrombosis. our laboratory has demonstrated a significant
role for lmwhs and for lmwh-releasable  xxxg2266xxx  on the regulation of angiogenesis,
tumor growth, and tumor metastasis; we have also seen potent inhibition of matrix-degrading enzymes by lmwhs but not by  xxxg2266xxx . the antiangiogenesis effect of lmwhs or
non-anticoagulant lmwh derivatives was shown to be reversed by anti- xxxg2266xxx . thus,
modulation of  xxxg748xxx /viia noncoagulant activities by lmwh-releasable  xxxg2266xxx  and
the inhibitory effects on matrix-degrading enzymes beside the anticoagulant efficacy have
provided an expanded clinical utility for lmwhs in angiogenesis-associated disorders,
including human tumor growth and metastasis.

introduction
in the nearly 130 years since trousseau first described migratory thrombophlebitis in
cancer patients, thromboembolism has become a well-established presenting sign and
complication of cancer (32). the coagulation system is activated in cancer and is further
amplified by treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. thrombosis is seen in
virtually all cancer types, albeit at different rates, and is the second leading cause of death
in cancer patients. the relationship between clotting activation and carcinogenesis supports the view of cancer as a hypercoagulable state and holds implications for the development of thrombosis, enhancement of tumor growth, and risk of poor clinical outcomes.
although it is well recognized that cancer can activate the coagulation cascade, it is less
well known that activation of the coagulation system may also support tumor progression.
the problem of thrombosis in patients with metastatic diseases is a serious concern for
clinicians. this monograph will explore the mechanisms and clinical implications of coagulation activation in cancer. the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism
(vte) in cancer also will be discussed by reviewing data from key clinical investigations.
finally, the emerging role of low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) as antineoplastic
agents will be explored.

blood coagulation and cancer
according to virchow, the hallmarks of thrombosis are pathological changes in blood
flow, coagulability, and the condition of the vessel wall. patients with cancer exhibit all
three conditions. proposed mechanisms to explain the hypercoagulation associated with
cancer include general factors related to the host’s response to the tumor (for example, abnormal protein synthesis, angiogenesis and neovascularization, cell necrosis, and new hemodynamic arrangements) and more specific factors related to tumor-mediated hemostatic
activities (in which cancer cells interact with monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells,
as well as the clotting and fibrinolytic systems) (5,30). see table 1 for the effects of malignant tumors on the three components involved in thrombosis.

tumor-related mechanisms
most patients with cancer have hemostatic abnormalities, which may include
upregulation of the coagulation cascade; increased platelet activation and aggregation;

release of cancer procoagulants; activation of endothelial cells (table 1), leading to the
overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1); and decreased hepatic synthesis of anticoagulation proteins, such as protein c and antithrombin (at) (9,30). this
abnormal activation of the coagulation cascade is mediated by the expression of procoagulants from tumor cells.
two particularly important tumor-derived mediators of hypercoagulation are cancer
procoagulant (a  xxxg548xxx  that can activate  xxxg741xxx ) and  xxxg748xxx  (tf; a cell
membrane receptor for  xxxg750xxx  that triggers the extrinsic coagulation
pathway via the tf/viia/xa complex). in addition, tumors promote excessive or unregulated angiogenesis by stimulating the activation, adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
transmigration of endothelial cells across cell matrixes. this, too, is a prothrombotic state
(3,6,30,47).

treatment-related mechanisms
chemotherapeutic agents are associated with thrombogenic mechanisms, including the
release of procoagulants and cytokines from tumor cells, production of toxic agents that
act directly on the endothelium, and reductions in levels of natural anticoagulants, such as
proteins c and s, and at. surgery, which is first-line therapy for many cancer patients, is
also well known to activate the hemostatic system. in so doing, cancer therapies initiate
the coagulation cascade, promoting thrombosis and tumor growth and producing unfavorable outcomes (5,24).

epidemiology of thrombosis in cancer
approximately 15% of cancer patients have clinically relevant thrombosis (32). on
postmortem examinations, anatomical thrombosis is evident in 20 to 50% of patients with
metastatic cancers, particularly mucinous carcinomas of the pancreas, lung, and gastrointestinal tract (39). fibrin or platelet thrombi also have been noted in many tumor types
during histological examination of tissues. in fact, thrombosis ranks as the second most
common cause of death in patients with overt malignant disease (5). see table 2 for the
different tumor types associated with venous thrombosis.
thrombosis may be the first clinically evident sign of a malignant tumor. as many as
15 to 20% of patients who develop vte and lack identifiable risk factors will subse-

quently be diagnosed with cancer (29,33). the standardized incidence ratio for cancer
within 1 year of a vte episode is 2.3 (95% ci, 2.0 to 2.7) (38). an 8-year follow-up of
355 patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (dvt) found that nearly 10% had
developed new malignancies (34).
analyses of large databases have revealed that the frequency of thromboembolic complications varies in different types of tumors, with cancers of the pancreas, brain, and
ovary most commonly implicated (26,41). conversely, the risk of vte is lower in patients
with head or neck, breast, uterine, or prostate cancer than in patients who are hospitalized
for noncancer-related reasons.
although a clear link has been established between cancer and vte (fig. 1), little is
known about the prognosis of patients in whom a cancer is discovered at the time of or following a thrombotic event. an analysis of population-based data from the danish national registry of patients, the danish cancer registry, and the danish mortality files revealed that a diagnosis of cancer within 1 year of an episode of vte was associated with a

poor prognosis (37). one year after the diagnosis of cancer, the survival rate was 38% in
such patients compared with 47% in a demographically matched population of cancer patients without vte. this difference was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). the
mortality ratio was 1.35 (95% ci, 1.20 to 1.50) at 1 year and 1.30 (95% ci, 1.18 to 1.42)
for the entire period analyzed. the investigators concluded that cancer diagnosed in close
proximity to an episode of vte is associated with an advanced stage of cancer and a poor
prognosis. however, these results do not take into account the possible effects of antineoplastic therapies or the fact that patients with vte received antithrombotic therapy that
may improve cancer outcome. these points will be addressed later.

prevention and treatment of vte in cancer
challenges
the prevention of vte in cancer patients presents several challenges. of pivotal
concern is the fact that no consistently reliable markers are available to determine precisely which patients are at risk of a thrombolic event. consequently, decisions regarding
specific measures for thromboprophylaxis must be tailored to the individual patient. although the need for perioperative prophylaxis has been well established, several different
options are available, as discussed below.
a variety of challenges are also involved in the diagnosis of vte. this is especially
true with respect to cancer patients, many of whom are asymptomatic. in particular, d-dimer testing sometimes can be problematic because levels are more often normal in dvt
with cancer than in dvt without cancer. the explanation for this fact is unknown but may
be due to fibrinolytic shutdown associated with certain tumor types. the essential point is
that d-dimer assays differ; therefore, highly sensitive tests must be used (23,40).
the treatment of vte also raises a number of specific considerations in cancer patients, compared with patients without cancer. cancer patients have more extensive and
aggressive thrombosis characterized by increased coagulation, more widespread clot formation, and higher recurrence rates, as demonstrated in a study of more than 1100 patients
with acute dvt, of whom 125 had cancer (19). the results of laboratory tests revealed
differences in a variety of coagulation parameters between cancer patients and noncancer patients. in addition, at 3 months, the rate of clinical recurrence of dvt was significantly higher in cancer patients than in non-cancer patients (8.8 vs 3.3%, respectively;
p = 0.007). thus, careful monitoring of these patients is critical.
finally, although the coagulation system is stimulated in cancer, bleeding also is
common and may be provoked by some cancer therapies. clinicians must judiciously
balance the potential for thrombosis and hemorrhage when treatment decisions are made (4).

treatment options
several options are available for the treatment of vte in cancer patients. these include
subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin (ufh) on an outpatient basis, followed by oral anticoagulation; the use of an inferior vena cava filter (which should be considered only when anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated); administration of intravenous
ufh, followed by an oral anticoagulant, on an inpatient basis; and administration of sub-

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 22, no. 2, 2004

s. a. mousa

cutaneous lmwh, with or without an oral anticoagulant, in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. generally, initial treatment with either lmwh or ufh, followed with oral
anticoagulation, is appropriate for the majority of cancer patients with vte (32).

differences between lmwhs and ufh
the characteristics of lmwhs and ufh differ in several important respects (14,31,45,
47). compared with ufh, lmwhs have a reduced affinity for binding to plasma proteins
and cells, resulting in more favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles as
well as in potentially superior clinical utility (14,31). the greater affinity of ufh for plasma-protein binding limits its anticoagulant activity and, along with variations in plasma
concentrations of heparin-binding proteins, helps explain the erratic anticoagulant response to this agent. other properties of lmwhs that contribute to their superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles include improved subcutaneous bioavailability,
longer half-lives, altered number of at-iii binding sites, altered degree of sulfation
(charge density), altered  xxxg745xxx  inhibitory activities (anti-xa, anti-iia, and antixa/anti-iia ratio), and enhanced vascular endothelial cell binding and promotion of the release of  xxxg2266xxx  ( xxxg2266xxx ).
these characteristics of lmwhs translate into clinical advantages, which include more
convenient fixed or weight-based dosing regimens, lack of a need for laboratory monitoring, reduced lengths of stay in hospitalized patients, and potentially greater clinical efficacy (31). consequently, a number of studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of
lmwh therapy. although lmwhs are more expensive than ufh, patients receiving
lmwhs require fewer venipunctures for laboratory assays and less attention from professional staff, and they have increased options for outpatient therapy. for all these reasons,
lmwhs are increasingly becoming the treatment of choice for the prevention and
treatment of vte. regulatory bodies in the us and europe have set up dosing regimens
for the three lmwhs that have been approved for the prevention and treatment of vte
(8,17,27). see table 3 for possible mechanisms of heparin action in cancer.
an extensive body of evidence has demonstrated that lmwhs are at least as effective
as ufh for preventing vte in surgical and high-risk medical patients. numerous randomized studies have also compared the use of lmwh and ufh as initial treatment for
vte (14). a meta-analysis, based on studies in non-cancer patients and a small number of
cancer patients, found a significant reduction in major hemorrhagic events as well as
overall mortality with lmwh vs ufh in patients with acute dvt (10,14). rates of recurrent vte did not differ significantly by treatment.

lmwhs, thrombosis, and cancer

127

the cortes study, involving 125 cancer patients with acute dvt, found a significantly better phlebographic response to initial treatment with both lower and higher doses
of a lmwh (reviparin) compared with ufh when both agents were given in combination
with a  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist (19). rates of clinical recurrence likewise favored lmwh
over ufh, although the differences were not statistically significant. these results suggest
that ufh and lmwh may act differently on thrombosis associated with hypercoagulation
in cancer. furthermore, as noted above, lmwhs offer a variety of practical advantages
over ufh, including ease of administration, which may help facilitate the initial treatment
of vte in cancer patients.

differences among lmwhs
different methods are used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce lmwhs, and
these differences account for the variation in the compounds’ physical and chemical properties (14,31,45). in particular, the degree of sulfation (charge density) varies from product
to product, generating distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for each of
the agents. as a consequence, the several lmwhs have different dosing regimens and biological activity, and may produce dissimilar clinical efficacy and safety. these characteristics have prompted various scientific and regulatory bodies to declare that the various
lmwhs are dissimilar.
initial attempts to standardize the agents on the basis of their biologic activity, especially their anti-xa potency, have failed, in part because activity against this coagulation
factor is but one of many essential properties of lmwhs, including effects on  xxxg741xxx 
and iia inhibition, release of  xxxg2266xxx , inhibition of cell adhesion molecules, decrease of circulating  xxxg2423xxx  levels, and modulation of blood flow. most of these effects
cannot be measured by conventional anticoagulation tests. to this extent, the several
lmwhs are not interchangeable.

considerations for secondary prophylaxis
as noted, cancer patients have increased coagulation, more extensive clot formation,
and higher rates of recurrence of vte than do patients without cancer. in addition, coagulation is further amplified by cancer treatments themselves. for these reasons, secondary
prophylaxis should continue until cancer treatment is terminated and the cancer has either
stabilized or resolved. for many patients, this will entail lifelong prophylaxis.
compared with warfarin, lmwh offers several advantages for secondary prevention
of vte (25,28,42). treatment with lmwh is associated with lower rates of recurrent
vte and bleeding, provides more consistent anticoagulation, and does not require routine
monitoring. for these reasons, lmwh is becoming an increasingly popular option for the
prevention of recurrent vte in cancer patients.
cancer patients with acute vte who receive long-term oral anticoagulation therapy
with  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists have an elevated risk of thromboembolic complications and
bleeding when compared with non-cancer patients. long-term oral anticoagulation with
 xxxd3522xxx  antagonists can also be limited by difficulty in maintaining the international
normalized ratio (inr) within the therapeutic range, the presence of thrombocytopenia
(and thus an increased bleeding risk), and poor venous access. the use of lmwh may be
a preferable alternative. an open-label, randomized study of cancer patients with symptomatic acute proximal dvt compared  xxxd1805xxx  (200 iu/kg subcutaneously once daily

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 22, no. 2, 2004

128

s. a. mousa

for 5 to 7 days) followed by a coumarin derivative (target inr = 2.5) for 6 months vs.  xxxd1805xxx  alone (200 iu/kg for 1 month, followed by 150 iu/kg for 5 months) (25). over
the 6-month duration of the study, the hazard rate for recurrent vte in the group receiving
 xxxd1805xxx  alone relative to the group receiving  xxxd1805xxx  plus oral anticoagulant was 0.48
(p = 0.0017). the cumulative rate of recurrent vte was 8.8% in the  xxxd1805xxx -alone arm
compared with 17.4% in the combination therapy arm. major bleeding and cumulative
mortality rates were similar in the two groups. the investigators concluded that long-term
lmwh was more effective than oral anticoagulant therapy for reducing the risk of recurrent vte in cancer patients, with no increased risk of bleeding.

special considerations in thrombosis management
in view of the fact that lmwhs are eliminated by the kidneys and the reticuloendothelial system, the pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents may be altered in elderly patients who have renal impairment (14). periodic monitoring of anti-xa is thereby recommended in these patients.
 xxxd3379xxx  has an anti-xa/anti-iia ratio of 2.0, the highest of the most commonly used
agents. in a study of elderly hospital patients (>70 years old) with a mean creatinine
clearance of 40.6 ± 15.3 ml/min (range, 20 to 72 ml/min), anti-xa activity did not
increase after repeated subcutaneous administration of a standard dose of  xxxd3379xxx 
(175 iu/kg) once daily on days 2, 5, and 7 of a 10-day period (36). the mean level on day
2 was 0.66 iu/ml and did not vary during the study period. analysis of anti-iia activity
also confirmed the absence of accumulation at peak levels between days 2 and 10. the investigators concluded that  xxxd3379xxx  may be administered safely at recommended doses
in elderly patients with age-related renal impairment. however, monitoring of  xxxd3379xxx 
dosing may still be advisable and would be particularly appropriate with other lmwhs.
obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for vte, and lmwh treatment regimens are
dosed based on weight. the question of whether weight-based dosing adjustments are
suitable for obese patients remains unresolved. however, insights into this issue were provided by a study that examined the pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd3379xxx  in subjects who
weighed more than 100 kg or had a body mass index above 30 kg/m2 (12). the analysis
revealed that mean values for anti-xa and anti-iia activity were consistent and similar in
patients with higher weight compared with historical controls. the investigators concluded that subcutaneous dosing of  xxxd3379xxx  based on body weight is appropriate in patients with increased weight (35). likewise, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
studies of once daily enoxaparin in obese and nonobese healthy individuals suggest there
is no need to modify the currently recommended dose of this drug in obesity. here, too,
monitoring remains appropriate when doubt exists about the efficacy of weight-based
lmwh dosing.

effects of heparins on human cancer
a growing body of data suggests that adjunctive therapy with heparin may improve
prognosis in cancer patients. one of the first studies to demonstrate heparin’s potential to
increase survival in this population was conducted by kakkar and colleagues (21). the investigators retrospectively reviewed a cohort of more than 1000 patients undergoing

major abdominal surgery with or without perioperative thromboprophylaxis with heparin.
the investigators found that, not only did those patients who received heparin therapy for
vte prophylaxis show a significantly lower 3-year mortality rate (heparin = 7.6% vs.
control = 12.5%, p = 0.0005) than those not receiving heparin, but deaths from disseminated cancer in the subgroup of patients undergoing surgery for malignancies were also
dramatically reduced (heparin = 9.2% vs. control = 21.4%; rr 2.23, 95% ci 1.33–4.09).
while this trial did not control for important cancer prognostic variables, such as tumor
type and standard treatment, it provided an impetus for researchers to continue investigating heparin’s potential role as an antineoplastic agent.
a prospective trial using heparin as anti-cancer therapy was conducted with 281 patients with small cell lung cancer (sclc) (22). the researchers reported that complete response rate was significantly greater in the group receiving chemotherapy plus subcutaneous ufh compared to chemotherapy alone (37 vs. 23%, respectively; p = 0.004). the
median survival was also significantly longer in the ufh group (317 vs. 261 days, respectively; p = 0.01).
the effectiveness of lmwhs in this tumor type was evaluated more recently by
altinbas et al. (1). in this trial, 281 patients with sclc were randomized to receive either
chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,  xxxd2008xxx , and vincristine, or cev) or cev plus
lmwh ( xxxd1805xxx ). at 18 weeks, response rate (complete plus partial) was significantly
higher in patients receiving lmwh plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone
(78 vs. 36%, respectively; p = 0.004). moreover, the duration of progression-free survival
was significantly longer with the addition of lmwh (9 months vs. 5 months with chemotherapy alone; p = 0.02). a final report is forthcoming.
wojtukiewicz et al. (46) evaluated survival in a pilot study of enoxaparin in patients
with melanoma, one of the most difficult cancers to treat with standard chemo- and immunotherapy regimens. of the 71 patients in this study, 18 had not received any prior systemic chemotherapy, and no patients received prior immunotherapy. even though a very
low dose of enoxaparin was used (20 mg daily), the survival rates for patients with stage
iii and iv disease compared favorably with those seen in historical controls receiving
standard chemotherapy (estimated to range from 3 to 11 months). further studies based
upon this pilot investigation are warranted.
the comparative effects of perioperative lmwh and ufh on survival after cancer
surgery also have been examined. in a prospective, randomized study of women with previously untreated breast or pelvic cancer, investigators found that the risk of mortality was
significantly lower with lmwh than with ufh at 650 days after surgery (5.7 vs. 15.6%,
respectively; p = 0.006) (43). a survival advantage of lmwh over ufh remained apparent at 1050 days, although the difference was no longer significant. subgroup analyses
by type of cancer revealed that mortality rates for the breast-cancer cohort were not significantly lower with lmwh compared with ufh at either the first or second time point.
however, the survival rate in patients with pelvic cancer was significantly lower with
lmwh vs. ufh at 650 days (8.7 vs. 28.6%, respectively; p = 0.0139) and an advantage
persisted at 1050 days (15.2 vs. 28.6%, respectively), although the difference was no
longer significant. the investigators suggested that different tumor types in different
stages of disease might have different responses to prophylactic treatment with lmwh.
they called for further prospective, randomized trials to examine outcomes in patients
stratified by tumor cell type, stage, and other prognostic variables.

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 22, no. 2, 2004

retrospective analyses have also suggested that lmwhs may offer a survival advantage over ufh in cancer patients with thromboembolic disorders. one such analysis
evaluated the relative effects of  xxxd3379xxx  and ufh on total and cancer-related mortality
in patients with proximal dvt, compared with a group of patients without cancer (16).
the rate of cancer-related mortality was significantly reduced with  xxxd3379xxx  compared
with ufh (12.6 vs. 27%, respectively; p = 0.041), whereas no significant difference was
apparent between the agents in patients without cancer. an analysis of all patients in the
study revealed a significant reduction in all cause mortality with  xxxd3379xxx  vs. ufh (mortality rates of 4.6 and 9.6%, respectively; p = 0.044). green and colleagues suggested that
the mechanisms of benefit with lmwh might include the inhibition of endothelial cell
growth and intimal thickening following endothelial injury, as well as a dampening of the
activity of excitatory angiogenesis mediators (11). another possible explanation is the
greater promotion of  xxxg2266xxx  release by lmwh compared with ufh.
famous was the first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine
possible effects of lmwh therapy ( xxxd1805xxx ) on survival in patients with various
cancers without underlying thrombosis (20). a total of 382 patients were randomized to
receive either 5000 anti-xa units of  xxxd1805xxx  daily (via injection) or placebo (saline)
along with standard cancer therapies.  xxxd1805xxx  was associated with a survival advantage
at 12, 24, and 36 months, although the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. however, a subgroup analysis found that lmwh treatment was associated with a
significant increase in survival at 25 and 36 months in patients considered to have a “good
prognosis” (i.e., those who survived at least 17 months after randomization). the investigators concluded that while lmwh therapy did not produce an immediate survival
benefit, it may offer an advantage in patients who survive longer. an additional analysis,
focusing on survival by tumor type, is currently being performed.
the oncenox study, presented at the 2003 american society of clinical oncology
annual meeting, noted a trend toward reduced recurrent venous thromboemboli in patients
with primary intracranial malignancies who were treated with the lmwh enoxaparin.
the oncenox and clot trials, along with the lite trial (personal communication,
r. hull and s. deitcher, 2003), essentially have shown the efficacy of treatment with
lmwh. however, due to the differing sizes of the trials, only the clot trial is considered to be statistically significant, but they all show that lmwh in a cancer patient
population is well tolerated, with good compliance, and that these patients had lower
thrombosis recurrence rates. a patient population that may be difficult to monitor and treat
with one antithrombotic can actually do better on a different antithrombotic agent, one that
does not even require monitoring.

effects of heparins in cancer
mechanisms of action
a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of heparin on
tumors (7,13,15,18,30,47) (table 3). these mechanisms can be broadly classified as direct
antitumor effects, antiangiogenic effects, and immune modulation. therapeutic heparin
may influence tumor cell growth because of its chemical resemblance to cell-surface-associated and extracellular matrix (ecm) heparin-like glycoaminoglycans. these molecules

regulate the way in which cells perceive their environment by interacting with growth
factors, enzymes, chemokines, and matrix proteins at the interface of the cell and ecm so
as to modulate signal transduction and thereby regulate malignant cell growth. under
certain experimental conditions, heparin may also induce apoptosis and differentiation of
neoplastic cells. work in experimental models has demonstrated that heparin regulates the
expression of certain oncogenes, including c-myc and c-fos (2,44).
the antiangiogenic effects of heparin likely play a central role in its potential utility as
an antineoplastic agent. these effects appear to be unrelated to the anticoagulant actions
of the compound. the evidence suggests that heparin acts by stabilizing angiogenic
growth factors stored in the ecm.
the effects of heparin on the coagulation cascade include the inhibition of factor iia,
inhibition of tf expression, and activation of  xxxg2266xxx , which down-regulates the activity of
tf and factors viia and xa (the extrinsic coagulation pathway). in addition, heparin promotes the release of tissue plasminogen activator and pai-1 from endothelial cells, facilitating fibrinolysis.

the role of  xxxg2266xxx 
there is great interest in exploring the vascular versus plasmatic effects of lmwhs,
and this interest has focused on the role of  xxxg2266xxx  in both thrombosis and noncoagulant processes. a number of preclinical investigations have begun to describe the broad range of
 xxxg2266xxx  actions. some of those studies are described below.
 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) is a potent proangiogenic molecule produced by a variety of cell types.  xxxg2266xxx , by blocking both the coagulant and noncoagulant
activities of the tf/viia/xa complex, can modulate the metastatic processes induced by
pathological angiogenesis (30,31,47). in a study using a chick chorioallantoic membrane
(cam) model of human colon cancer, the administration of  xxxd3379xxx  at 24 hs after stimulation of angiogenesis by vegf returned the angiogenesis index to levels comparable to
untreated controls (30).
similar effects of  xxxd3379xxx  were observed when colon carcinoma (hct-116) was used
to stimulate angiogenesis. additional research demonstrated approximately an 80% reduction in the growth of colon cancer and fibrosarcoma 1 week after the administration of
a single 0.1 mg dose of  xxxd3379xxx  in the cam tumor implant model. the investigators
concluded that  xxxd3379xxx  may play an important role in retarding tumor growth and metastasis by stimulating the production of endothelial  xxxg2266xxx .
a third study looked at platelet count, a sensitive marker of intravascular coagulation
and useful indicator of tumor-induced clotting activation. using an animal model of lung
metastasis, mousa observed that the number of platelets fell rapidly and significantly (by
nearly 50%) after the injection of tumor cells (30). this effect was almost completely reversed by  xxxd3379xxx . with daily administration of  xxxd3379xxx  over the next 14 days,
the formation of lung metastases was reduced by 96% relative to controls. no bleeding
problems were observed.
it is important to keep in mind that manufacturing differences between the several
lmwhs affect the agents’ biological and chemical properties, including the release of endothelial  xxxg2266xxx . in general, the higher the molecular weight and degree of sulfation, the
greater the release of endothelial  xxxg2266xxx . among the most commonly used lmwhs,  xxxd3379xxx , with an average molecular weight of 6500 kda, has the highest degree of sulfation
and, therefore, generates the highest levels of  xxxg2266xxx  immediately after administration (31).

this advantage is maintained for 2 hs, after which the  xxxg2266xxx  levels become comparable to
those of the other lmwhs. in light of  xxxg2266xxx ’s manifold vascular and plasmatic effects,
these differences may be of therapeutic importance, especially with regard to the use of
lmwhs as cancer therapy.

future directions
the safety and utility of lmwh in the prevention and treatment of vte in a wide
range of medical and surgical conditions have now been established. in oncology, evidence is emerging that lmwhs may be superior to ufh as prophylaxis and initial
therapy for vte. the lmwhs offer improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
profiles as well as a more predictable anticoagulant response when compared with ufh.
in addition, lmwhs have increased bioavailability, longer half-lives, variability in the
number of at binding sites, and a higher anti-xa/anti-iia inhibitory ratio. however, the
different lmwhs vary with regard to endothelial cell binding kinetics and potency for releasing  xxxg2266xxx  from the endothelium. compared with ufh, lmwhs offer greater ease of
administration, as these agents can be given subcutaneously by a health professional, caregiver, or the patient, allowing use in both inpatient and outpatient settings. regular monitoring is not required. treatment with lmwh may also be superior to oral anticoagulants
for secondary prevention of vte.
several of the characteristics of lmwhs suggest that these agents may have an important role to play in future research on new cancer treatment regimens. through direct
antitumor and antiangiogenic effects, as well as modulation of the immune system,
lmwhs appear to have significant antineoplastic activity. the results of retrospective and
prospective trials suggest that lmwhs may help modulate certain processes in cancer and
provide a survival benefit. further clinical trials, controlling for treatment regimen, tumor
cell type, stage, performance status, and other prognostic variables, are in order to shed
more light on the potential role of lmwhs in the treatment of cancer.
