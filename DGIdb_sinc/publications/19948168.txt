a b s t r a c t
 xxxd3564xxx  is an fda-approved antiepileptic drug that blocks voltage-dependent na+ channels and t-type
ca2+ channels and improves clinical outcome in parkinson's disease (pd) patients when used as an
adjunct to other pd therapies.  xxxd3564xxx  also modiﬁes dopamine (da) activity, provides protection in
ischemia models and inﬂuences antioxidant systems. thus, we tested it for its ability to protect da
neurons in a mouse model of pd and investigated mechanisms underlying its protection. concurrent
treatment of mice with  xxxd3564xxx  and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetraydropyridine (mptp) attenuated
the reduction in striatal contents of da, its metabolite dopac and  xxxg2276xxx  (th). we also
discovered that  xxxd3564xxx  inhibited  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b) activity in vitro with an ic50 of
25 mum, a concentration that is well within the therapeutic range used for treating epilepsy in humans.
moreover, the irreversible binding of systemically administered selegiline to mao-b in mouse brain was
attenuated by  xxxd3564xxx  as measured by ex vivo assays.  xxxd3564xxx  treatment alone did not produce any
lasting effects on ex vivo mao-b activity, indicating that it is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme.
consistent with the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  on mao-b, the striatal content of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
(mpp+), which is derived from the administered mptp via mao-b actions, was substantially reduced in
mice treated with mptp and  xxxd3564xxx . the potency and reversibility with which  xxxd3564xxx  blocks
mao-b may contribute to the ability of the drug to improve clinical symptoms in pd patients. the results
also suggest that caution in its use may be necessary, especially when administered with other drugs, in
the treatment of epilepsy or pd.

introduction
 xxxd3564xxx  is an fda-approved drug for use in treating epilepsy. it
has many actions which include blocking voltage-dependent sodium
channels, inactivating t-type calcium channels and reducing calcium
inﬂux during membrane depolarization, actions involved with
preventing seizure spread (biton, 2007; kito et al., 1996; meldrum
and rogawski, 2007). it is also reported that  xxxd3564xxx  improves
clinical outcome when used as an adjuvant in therapy for parkinson's
disease (pd) (murata et al., 2007) possibly due to its ability to modify
dopamine (da) neurotransmission.
 xxxd3564xxx  exerts neuroprotection in several experimental animals of neuronal injury including seizure models (asanuma and
miyazaki, 2007; ueda et al., 2005) and ischemia models (minato et al.,
1997). a preliminary report indicates it protected against damage to

the nigrostriatal da system induced by the dopaminergic neurotoxin,
6-hydroxydopamine (asanuma and miyazaki, 2007). it is proposed
that mechanisms by which  xxxd3564xxx  may exert neuroprotection are
via free radical scavenging, elevating brain glutathione content and
reducing oxidative stress (asanuma et al., 2008; tokumaru et al.,
2000; ueda et al., 2005). taken together, these actions suggest that
 xxxd3564xxx  may provide neuroprotection by reducing the burden of
oxidative stress which is increased in the brains of pd patients and
experimental pd models.
presently, there is no therapy for slowing the progression of
neuronal loss in pd. the possibility that an fda-approved drug,
which improves clinical symptoms in pd, might also slow the
progression of the disease, prompted us to consider the possibility
that  xxxd3564xxx  would protect da neurons in an animal model of pd.
the purposes of the study were to examine the effects of  xxxd3564xxx 
on neurotoxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp), on mptp metabolism, on the activity of monoamine
oxidase b (mao-b) and on da homeostasis. our ﬁndings indicate
that  xxxd3564xxx  is an effective inhibitor of mao-b at concentrations
that are within the plasma therapeutic concentrations achieved in
humans.

materials and methods

glutathione (gsh) assay

animals and treatment

striatal levels of total glutathione (gsh and  xxxd2811xxx ) were measured
by a kinetic assay according to kit directions (sigma-aldrich). brieﬂy,
pca extracts used for hplc measurements were incubated with 5,5″dithrobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb),  xxxg981xxx , and
nadph. the rate of formation of the reduction product of dtnb was
monitored at 412 nm with a spectrophotometric plate reader
(spectramax, molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). concentrations of
unknown samples were determined from standard curves generated
with known amounts of gsh.

male swiss webster mice (10–12 weeks of age, taconic farms,
germantown, ny) were used in accordance with the national
institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals
and as approved by the university's institutional animal care and use
committee. mice were treated with mptp (free base, 30 mg/kg s.c.,
sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo),  xxxd3564xxx  (various doses, i.p., sigmaaldrich) or 2.5 mg/kg selegiline i.p. (sigma-aldrich) and killed at the
times as indicated in the ﬁgure legends. the doses of  xxxd3564xxx 
administered were those in the low to moderate dose range for
blocking seizure activity in mice (borowicz et al., 2007; nagatomo et
al., 1996, 2000). the dose of selegiline used provides selective and
near complete inhibition of mao-b and protects against mptp toxicity
in mice (sonsalla et al., 1987). striata were rapidly removed from the
brain, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -60°c until assayed.
determination of striatal th content
th was measured with elisa as previously described (alﬁnito et
al., 2003). brieﬂy, striata were homogenized in phosphate buffered
saline and aliquots of the homogenates were incubated in 96-well
microplates which had been coated with monoclonal anti-th and
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, followed by co-incubation with
rabbit polyclonal anti-th (calbiochem, san diego, ca) and polyclonal
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). reaction products from exposure to amplex red
(molecular probes, eugene, or) and horse radish peroxidase substrate
were measured ﬂuorometrically (excitation/emission ratio of 530/
580 nm).
measurement of da and dopac
an aliquot of the striatal homogenate was immediately removed
after homogenization and added to 0.2 n perchloric acid (pca)
containing 100 mum edta. after centrifugation, the supernatant was
analyzed for da and dopac with hplc and electrochemical detection
(antec leyden, the netherlands) as previously described (moy et al.,
2000).
 xxxg1358xxx  (mao) activity
mao-b activity in homogenates from mouse striata or cerebral
cortices was determined with the amplex red  xxxg1358xxx 
assay kit (molecular probes) as previously described (rocha et al.,
2008). brieﬂy, homogenates were incubated with the mao-b
substrate  xxxd314xxx  in the presence or absence of  xxxd3564xxx 
(concentrations from 10 to 300 mum) or selegiline (1 mum; mao-b
inhibitor) for 30 min. for mao-a activity, homogenates were
incubated with tyramine and selegiline (the latter was required to
block the mao-b metabolism of tyramine) or  xxxd1730xxx  (1 mum;  xxxg1357xxx  inhibitor) for 30 min. all drugs and substrates were dissolved in
deionized water. activity was measured as the reaction product of
h2o2 generated with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihdroxyphenoxazine in a horseradish peroxidase-coupled reaction. fluorescence was measured
using a multiplate reader (cytofluor 4000, perseptive biosystems,
framingham, ma) with excitation/emission at 530/580 nm, respectively. graphpad prism software (la jolla, ca) was used to determine
the ic50 values for mao-b inhibition. in some experiments striata
were used whereas in other experiments the cortex was used for
evaluating activity. in preliminary studies we found no differences in
mao-b activity or in the extent of selegiline inhibition between striata
and cortex and thus data obtained from the two different brain
regions were combined.

mptp and mpp+ analysis
striata were dissected from the brain, frozen and stored at -20 °c
until analysis. striata (10–15 mg weight) were homogenized in 150 mul
of 12% acetic acid by sonication (20–30 min). the homogenates were
extracted in a mars x microwave sample digester (matthews, nc) for
30 min using 50% of the 300 w power setting. after extraction, both
solid and liquid phases were transferred onto 10 kda cut off microcon
centrifuge ﬁlters and ﬁltered using centrifugation (4 °c, 12,000 × g, 90
min). filtrates were stored at -20 °c until analyzed.
sample analysis
samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in an assay analogous to one for paraquat (prasad et al.,
2007). separation was carried out on a waters alliance separation
module 2690 (waters corporation, milford, ma) with a gradient
elution carried with a three-solvent system: (a) 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in
water, (b) 0.1%,  xxxd2154xxx  in methanol (c) 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in
acetonitrile on a zorbax rx-c8, 4.6 mm × 15 cm, 5 mum column
(agilent technologies, santa clara, ca). mpp+ was eluted at 9.4 min
and mptp  xxxd1891xxx .1 min monitored by both uv detector and mass
spectrometer. the analytes were quantiﬁed on an lcq itms mass
spectrometer (thermo finnegan, san jose, ca) equipped with an
electro spray ionization source (esi) operated using xcalibur1.3
software. mass spectrometric settings were optimized using a
standard solution (1 mug/ml) and electro spray ionization in the
positive mode with sheath gas ﬂow rate 1.4 l/min, heated capillary
temperature 275 °c, and spray voltage 5.0 kv. data acquisition was
performed in selective ion monitoring (sim) mode for mptp and mpp
+
at 174 m/z and 170 m/z respectively, with an isolation width 1 m/z.
concentrations were determined from a calibration curve using
integrated peak areas. integration was performed using xcalibur
software.
data analysis
data were analyzed using graphpad prism and are presented as
the mean ± sd. treatment effects on the neurochemical measures
were compared with one-way anova followed by tukey's multiple
comparison test. all values at p b 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

 xxxd3564xxx  protects against mptp-induced reductions of striatal
da measures
the administration of mptp (one injection of 30 mg/kg/day for
4 days) produced profound reductions in the content of striatal
th (-84%), da (-92%) and dopac (-65%) in mice killed 7 days after the
last mptp injection; see fig. 1. the pretreatment of mice with
 xxxd3564xxx  signiﬁcantly attenuated these losses in a dose-dependent
manner. at 20 mg/kg  xxxd3564xxx , the reductions in th, da and

before each mptp injection. mice received four daily injections of mptp (30 mg/kg/day s.c.) and were killed 7 days after the last treatment. results are the mean ± sd from 3 to 5
mice/group (control n = 4,  xxxd3564xxx  n = 3, all other groups n = 5). analysis of the data by one-way anova with post hoc testing revealed a signiﬁcant effect for th (f6

dopac were only -57%, -58% and -37%, respectively. signiﬁcant
protection was also seen with the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses but not the
1 mg/kg dose.
 xxxd3564xxx  pretreatment reduces content of striatal mpp+ in mice
treated with mptp
the next studies were designed to examine if the neuroprotective
effect observed with  xxxd3564xxx  was possibly due to its ability to alter
mptp metabolism. thus, mice were treated with or without
 xxxd3564xxx  (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and mptp (30 mg/kg, s.c.) and killed
90 min later. the 90 min time point was selected because mpp+ levels
in the mouse brain peak at this time (giovanni et al., 1991). the
amount of striatal mpp+ in mice treated with  xxxd3564xxx  and mptp
was signiﬁcantly lower than that seen in mice treated with vehicle
and mptp (0.8 ng/mg tissue vs. 3.1 ng/mg tissue, respectively); see
table 1. mptp levels were similar in both groups at this time point. in
previous studies in which measurements were made at the 90 min
time point, mptp levels in mice treated with the mao-b inhibitor
selegiline and mptp were not different from those in mice treated
with vehicle/mptp although mpp+ levels were reduced by 65% and
were similar to the reduction observed in the present studies
(heikkila et al., 1988). these data are consistent with an inhibitory
action of  xxxd3564xxx  on mptp metabolism.
 xxxd3564xxx  inhibits mao-b activity in vitro and in vivo

formation (data not shown). ex vivo studies were also conducted to
determine if  xxxd3564xxx  were a reversible or irreversible inhibitor of
mao-b and whether it could attenuate the irreversible binding of the
well-known inhibitor selegiline in vivo. for theses studies, mice
received an injection of  xxxd3564xxx  (20 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by an
injection of selegiline (2.5 mg/kg) and ex vivo measurements were
performed. there was no inhibition of ex vivo mao-b activity in brain
homogenates derived from mice treated with  xxxd3564xxx , indicating
that it was a reversible inhibitor (fig. 3). however, in mice treated
with  xxxd3564xxx  followed by selegiline treatment, there was a
signiﬁcant prevention of the irreversible binding of selegiline in the
brain. selegiline treatment signiﬁcantly reduced ex vivo mao-b
activity and this reduction was signiﬁcantly prevented in  xxxd3564xxx /selegiline treated mice (fig. 3). these ﬁndings indicate
 xxxd3564xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of mao-b in vitro and in vivo at
doses that exert anti-seizure activity in mice.
 xxxd3564xxx  does not alter da transport, da turnover or gsh levels
in striatum
protection of da neurons by drugs can occur by modifying da
transport, da activity or by substances that increase antioxidant
systems.  xxxd3564xxx  increases da synthesis and da release in rats as
measured by microdialysis (okada et al., 1995). however, in our
studies,  xxxd3564xxx  treatment of mice (20 mg/kg) did not alter
the striatal contents of da, dopac, th, or gsh nor did it modify

because mao-b is the enzyme that converts mptp to mpp+, we
next examined the inhibition proﬁle for  xxxd3564xxx  on mao-b
activity in mouse brain homogenates.  xxxd3564xxx  was discovered to
be a fairly potent inhibitor of mao-b and inhibited enzyme activity by
50% (ic50) at 24.8 ± 4.3 mum (mean ± sd, three experiments; see
fig. 2). the well-characterized mao-b inhibitor selegiline (1 mum)
completely blocked mao-b activity (data not shown). no inhibition of
mao-a was seen up to the highest concentration tested (300 mum)
although the mao-a inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx  (1 mum) blocked product

da turnover as calculated for the dopac/da ratio in mice killed
6 h after drug administration (see table 2). moreover, selegiline
administration did not affect da metabolism or turnover. in the
mouse, da is metabolized by mao-a. thus these data indicate that
neither  xxxd3564xxx  nor selegiline had any effect on mao-a activity at
the doses tested. we also examined if  xxxd3564xxx  had any effect on
the  xxxg2149xxx  by measuring 3h-da uptake into striatal
synaptosomal preparations. no appreciable effect of  xxxd3564xxx  was
found at concentrations up to 100 mum and are in agreement with
previously published ﬁndings (okada et al., 1995). thus, it is unlikely
that  xxxd3564xxx  prevented mpp+ uptake into da neurons or exerted
any long-lasting effect on da function.
discussion
 xxxd3564xxx  is an fda-approved drug used for seizure therapy and
is also being used as an adjunct to improve clinical outcome in pd
patients (murata et al., 2007). several properties of  xxxd3564xxx 
suggested that it might exert neuroprotection towards da neurons via
its ability to block sodium channels, t-type calcium channels and
enhance antioxidant systems (asanuma et al., 2008; asanuma and
miyazaki, 2007; czapinski et al., 2005; murakami et al., 2001; okada
et al., 1995; sobieszek et al., 2003), actions which would be beneﬁcial
to the survival of stressed da neurons.
in our studies,  xxxd3564xxx  treatment protected against the
mptp-induced decrements in da nerve terminal measures in a
dose-related manner. furthermore, our ﬁndings indicate that this
protection is mostly, if not completely, due to the drug's inhibition
of mao-b and a reduction in mptp metabolism rather than to any
intrinsic action on da turnover or antioxidant systems. evidence in
support of this conclusion comes from both in vitro and in vivo
studies.

mice were treated with  xxxd3564xxx  (20 mg/kg i.p.) approximately 30 min before
selegiline (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and killed approximately 5.5 h later. results are the mean ±
sd from the number of mice indicated in the table.

 xxxd3564xxx  was found to be a potent inhibitor of mao-b in mouse
brain homogenates with an ic50 ∼25 mum, a concentration well within
the recommended plasma therapeutic range for seizure control in
humans. in vivo, two separate experiments demonstrated that
 xxxd3564xxx  was an efﬁcient blocker of mao-b activity in mouse
brain. first,  xxxd3564xxx  markedly reduced the in vivo formation of
mpp+ from mptp, a process that is dependent on mao-b. second,
 xxxd3564xxx  treatment attenuated the irreversible binding of systemically administered selegiline. the greater effect of  xxxd3564xxx  in
inhibiting mptp metabolism than in preventing irreversible selegiline
binding is likely due to the differences in afﬁnities of mptp and
selegiline for mao-b with selegiline having a much higher afﬁnity
than mptp. the km for mptp metabolism by mao-b is approximately
100 mum whereas mao-b is completely inhibited by selegiline at
concentrations less than 1 mum (sonsalla et al., 1987). thus,  xxxd3564xxx 
(with a km ∼25 mum) would be more able to compete with mptp than
selegiline for the enzyme and thus exert a greater effect in blocking
mptp metabolism than in preventing selegiline binding. in addition,
because selegiline binds irreversibly to mao-b, access by  xxxd3564xxx 
to its binding site is markedly diminished as compared to other
reversible substances which exhibit the dynamic pharmacological
“on/off” rate of a compound at its site of action.
the doses of  xxxd3564xxx  used in these studies were selected based
on literature reports of their anti-seizure efﬁcacy in mice and their
ability to produce plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range
for humans. it was not expected that these doses would provide brain
concentrations that would interfere with mao-b. in mice, brain levels
of  xxxd3564xxx  are nearly 2-fold higher than plasma levels (approximately 70 vs. 40 mum, respectively) after a 20–25 mg/kg dose in mice
or rats (nagatomo et al., 1996, 2000; okada et al., 1995). okada et al
(1995) reported that  xxxd3564xxx  inhibited mao-b activity with an
ic50 value of approximately 700 mum which is 10 fold higher than the
expected brain concentration in our mice treated with a 20 mg/kg
dose of  xxxd3564xxx . however, with the discovery that  xxxd3564xxx  is
more potent than previously reported in inhibiting mao-b (ic50 of
25 mum) and with brain concentrations approaching 70 mum after a 20
mg/kg dose, it might be expected that signiﬁcant mao-b inhibition
would occur. that it did is documented by the in vivo inhibition of
mptp metabolism and selegiline binding. the reason why  xxxd3564xxx 
was much more potent as an mao-b inhibitor in our studies vs. the
okada studies is not clear, but may reﬂect species and/or tissue
differences in the source of mao-b (rat liver vs. mouse brain) or in the
preparation or storage of the drug solutions (e.g., use of methanol for
drug dissolution in the in vitro experiments of okada et al.). we found
that refrigeration or freezing of solutions of  xxxd3564xxx  dissolved in
water caused a precipitation of the drug. thus, we used only fresh
drug solutions for testing.
our data indicate that  xxxd3564xxx  had little effect on the striatal
content of da or dopac or on da turnover. these observations differ
from previous ﬁndings in which tissue da content was slightly, but
signiﬁcantly, increased and dopac content slightly decreased with
 xxxd3564xxx  treatment of rats at the same dose that we administered
to mice (okada et al., 1995). the differences in our ﬁndings vs.
previous studies may reﬂect the species used (rat vs. mouse) and/or
the time of measurement (2 vs. 6 h) after drug administration. it is
important to note that in rodents, da metabolism and turnover is
primarily a function of mao-a and not of mao-b as it is in humans
(shih et al., 1999). thus, the lack of an effect of  xxxd3564xxx  treatment
on da turnover in mice is consistent with the lack of an effect of
 xxxd3564xxx  on mao-a activity. given the species differences in da
metabolism by mao, the effect of  xxxd3564xxx  treatment in our mouse
studies does not exclude the possibility, and indeed our studies
indicate a high likelihood, that  xxxd3564xxx  exerts da-enhancing
effects in humans by inhibition of mao-b.
the doses of  xxxd3564xxx  used in seizure disorders range from 200
to 600 mg/day and produce plasma concentrations in humans

p.k. sonsalla et al. / experimental neurology 221 (2010) 329–334

ranging from 43 to 171 mum (mimaki, 1998, peters and sorkin, 1993). if
concentrations of  xxxd3564xxx  are higher in brain than in plasma in
humans, as they are in rodents, then doses that produce blood levels
within the therapeutic range would also likely produce substantial
inhibition of brain mao-b. targeted steady state serum concentrations of  xxxd3564xxx  for humans approximate 85 mum (mimaki, 1998)
and are close to 3-fold above the ic50 we determined for mao-b
inhibition. thus, there is likely to be substantial mao-b inhibition in
humans taking therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  for the treatment of
seizures. this may require caution in its use, particularly when used in
conjunction with other drugs.
the doses of  xxxd3564xxx  administered to pd patients were lower
than those used to control for seizures and ranged from 25 to 100 mg/
day (murata et al., 2007). although plasma  xxxd3564xxx  concentrations
were not determined in the pd patients, it seems likely that these
doses, particularly the higher doses, would produce brain concentrations capable of signiﬁcant inhibition of mao-b. as such, this action of
 xxxd3564xxx  would be beneﬁcial for enhancing da actions in the brains
of pd patients.
our discovery that  xxxd3564xxx  is a potent and effective in vivo
inhibitor of mao-b was surprising but adds to the list of drugs
serendipitously found to be substrates or inhibitors of this enzyme.
one of the ﬁrst surprises was the discovery that mptp was a substrate
for mao-b. subsequently, several other structurally unrelated
compounds have been found to be substrates or inhibitors of  xxxg1358xxx  and include mptp analogs, caffeine analogs, plant alkaloids and
pioglitazone (a  xxxg1807xxx  agonist)
(chen et al., 2001; khalil et al., 2006; kong et al., 2004; quinn et al.,
2008; yang et al., 2007; youngster et al., 1987; zhou et al., 2001).
these discoveries underscore the need to examine any potential
neuroprotective drug for possible interference with the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the toxicant being used to
create the animal model of pd.
after completion of the studies and during the writing of this paper,
we became aware of a very recent publication in which it was reported
that  xxxd3564xxx  did not protect against mptp toxicity in mouse or
marmoset although it increased da turnover in the mptp-treated
animals (yabe et al., 2009). reasons for these differences between our
studies and those of yabe et al. are not clear but may reﬂect differences
in mouse strain used, doses and dosing protocols. we used swiss
webster mice whereas yabe et al. used c57bl mice. we dosed once per
day (30 mg/kg mptp s.c. and ≤20 mg/kg  xxxd3564xxx  i.p.) whereas
yabe et al. dosed four times in 1 day at 2 h intervals (mptp, 15 mg/kg/
inj s.c. for a total dose of 60 mg/kg).  xxxd3564xxx  was also administered
four times at 2-h intervals at a dose of 40 mg/kg/inj s.c. for a total dose
of 160 mg/kg. while it might be expected that better protection would
have been seen with a larger dose of  xxxd3564xxx , the dose and dosing
protocol with  xxxd3564xxx  alone produced a signiﬁcant decrease in
striatal da content 1 week later as compared to controls which
indicates the drug may have had an adverse effect on the da system
which was compounded in mice also treated with mptp. previous
studies showed that low doses of  xxxd3564xxx  increase da release
whereas high doses inhibit release (okada et al., 1995). further studies
are needed to more completely characterize the dose–effect of
 xxxd3564xxx  on da neurotransmission, particularly under the stressed
conditions which arise following a toxic insult.
