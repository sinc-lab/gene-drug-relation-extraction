mu-opioid receptor downregulation contributes to opioid tolerance in vivo.  the present study examined the contribution of downregulation of mu-opioid receptors to opioid tolerance in an intact animal model. mice were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps that infused  xxxd2070xxx  (50-250 microg/kg/day) for 7 days. other mice were implanted subcutaneously with a morphine pellet (25 mg) or a morphine pellet plus an osmotic minipump that infused morphine (5-40 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. controls were implanted with an inert placebo pellet. at the end of treatment, pumps and pellets were removed, and saturation binding studies were conducted in whole brain ([3h]damgo) or morphine and  xxxd2070xxx  analgesic ed(50)s were determined (tail-flick). morphine tolerance increased linearly with the infusion dose of morphine (ed(50) shift at highest infusion dose, 4.76). no significant downregulation of mu-receptors in whole brain was observed at the highest morphine treatment dose.  xxxd2070xxx  produced dose-dependent downregulation of mu-opioid receptor density and tolerance (ed(50) shift at highest infusion dose, 6.97). downregulation of mu-receptors only occurred at the higher  xxxd2070xxx  infusion doses (> or =150 microg/kg/day). unlike morphine tolerance, the magnitude of  xxxd2070xxx  tolerance was a nonlinear function of the dose and increased markedly at infusion doses that produced downregulation. these results suggest that mu-opioid receptor downregulation contributes to opioid tolerance in vivo. therefore, opioid tolerance appears to rely upon both "receptor density-dependent" and " receptor density-independent" mechanisms.
