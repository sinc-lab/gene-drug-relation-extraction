summary
the mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) is a serine/
threonine kinase that functions as a key regulator of cell
growth, protein synthesis, and cell-cycle progression through
interactions with a number of signalling pathways, including
pi3k/akt, ras, tcl1, and  xxxg23xxx . many haematological
malignancies have aberrant activation of the mtor and
related signalling pathways. accordingly, mtor inhibitors, a
class of signal transduction inhibitors that were originally
developed as immunosuppressive agents, are being investigated
in preclinical models and clinical trials for a number of
haematological malignancies. sirolimus and second-generation
mtor inhibitors, such as  xxxd3307xxx  and  xxxd2072xxx , are
safe and relatively well-tolerated, making them potentially
attractive as single agents or in combination with conventional
cytotoxics and other targeted therapies. promising early
clinical data suggests activity of mtor inhibitors in a number
of haematological diseases, including acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma,
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and lymphoproliferative
disorders. this review describes the rationale for using mtor
inhibitors in a variety of haematological diseases with a focus
on their use in leukaemia.

are being investigated in a number of tumour types in both
pre-clinical models and clinical trials. sirolimus (rapamycin),
a macrocyclic lactone produced by streptomyces hydroscopicus, was the first mti to be used in a clinical setting
(schmelzle & hall, 2000). sirolimus is us fedral drug
administration (fda)-approved as an immunosuppressive
agent in solid organ transplantation, but the drug has clear
anti-neoplastic activity and is in phase ii–iii trials against a
variety of cancers (baldo et al, 2008). sirolimus has poor
aqueous solubility and variable bioavailability, requiring
therapeutic drug monitoring. a number of second-generation mtis, including  xxxd3307xxx  ( xxxd3307xxx ),  xxxd2072xxx 
( xxxd2072xxx ), and deferolimus ( xxxd3114xxx ) have been developed
to circumvent those problems. these agents are also being
investigated in a number of malignancies.  xxxd3307xxx  was
the first mti to gain fda approval for any malignancy,
having been approved for the treatment of advanced renal
cell carcinoma (baldo et al, 2008).
when used as monotherapy, mtis are relatively welltolerated. unlike the commonly used immunophillins, ciclosporin and tacrolimus, mtis cause little nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity. mtis may cause hyperlipidemia, mild myelosuppression, hypertension, and mucositis (baldo et al, 2008).
the toxicities of combining mtis with conventional cytotoxic
agents have not been fully explored in both preclinical and
clinical studies.
because mtor signalling has been demonstrated to be
important in cell growth and survival in a number of
haematological malignancies, mtis are being investigated in
a myriad of diseases. preclinical studies have demonstrated
mtis have activity either when used as single agents and/or
when used in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics
and other targeted agents in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,
acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
chronic myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin
lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and non-malignant
haematological disorders, including lymphoproliferative
disorders. numerous clinical trials are underway for these
diseases and early clinical data has shown potential activity in a
number of these conditions. this review will focus on the use

of mtis in leukaemia, but will also briefly summarize on-going
work in other malignant and non-malignant haematological
disorders.

the mtor signalling network
mammalian target of rapamycins is a 210 kda protein that has
c-terminal homology to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3k)
and is therefore a member of the pi3k-related kinase family
(wullschleger et al, 2006). mtor is a  xxxg1377xxx 
that acts as a central regulator of cell growth, survival,
metabolism, and proliferation and functions as a sensor to
ensure that the cell is in an appropriate nutritional and
bioenergenic state to support these processes prior to committing to growth and division (schmelzle & hall, 2000).
when mtor is activated, a number of cellular processes
occur, including an increase in ribosomal biogenesis, capdependent translation (initiation of translation involving
5¢-end of mrna), top-protein translation (translation of
specific class of mrnas containing oligopyrimine tracts in
5¢untranslated region), expression of metabolism-related
genes, cell growth, nutrient and amino acid uptake, and an
increase in cell cycle transit time (wullschleger et al, 2006).
conversely, the activation of mtor leads to an inhibition of
apoptosis and autophagy (asnaghi et al, 2004; zeng & kinsella,
2008). the import of nutrients and amino acids is critical for
the generation of atp and cell metabolism. mtor regulates
these processes in part by up-regulating the protein translation
machinery, which results in the synthesis of nutrient and
amino acid transporters (e.g. glut 1), as well as key molecules
that promote cell growth and survival, such as  xxxg1048xxx , cyclin
d1, and myc (gera et al, 2004; majumder et al, 2004).
mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  can form two distinct
complexes, mtorc1 and mtorc2 (fig 1) (bhaskar & hay,
2007). mtorc1 is sensitive to mtis, including sirolimus, and
is thought to regulate cell growth, proliferation, autophagy and
translation in response to nutrients and energy availability.
data suggest that mtorc2 is insensitive to mtis in some cell
types whereas mtorc2 remains sensitive to mtis in other
cancer cell types (rosner & hengstschlager, 2008). mtorc2’s
function, regulation and response to mtis remains unclear,
and seems to vary by cell type. mtor is activated by a number
of upstream signalling pathways, including pi3k/akt, ras/
mapk/rsk, cytokine signalling (ikk), tcl1, bcr-abl, and
nutrient (amino acid) sensing via the rag gtp-binding
proteins (shaw & cantley, 2006; kharas et al, 2008). the
main downstream targets of activated mtorc1 are  xxxg1989xxx  and
the inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, 4e- xxxg693xxx  (wullschleger et al, 2006). figure 1 summarizes the mtor signalling
pathway.
a number of mechanisms that lead to mtor deregulation
have been identified. these include overexpression of growth
factors (such as insulin-like growth factor, igf), overexpression or mutations of growth factor receptors [e.g.  xxxg1145xxx ,
human  xxxg681xxx  egf receptor (her/egfr)],
570

point mutations in the  xxxg1745xxx  ( xxxg1745xxx  pi3k) gene, loss of
tumour suppressor genes (e.g. pten or  xxxg2337xxx : xxxg2338xxx  complex),
and gain-of-function mutations in mtor or mtor-linked
pathways (e.g. formation of the aberrant protein bcr-abl in
ph + leukaemia cells or stimulation of pi3k by aberrant ras/
raf/mapk pathway intermediates) (inoki et al, 2005). of these
mechanisms, the most common ones are related to the
overexpression or constitutive activation of pi3k or akt
and/or the loss of pten (inoki et al, 2005). through mtormediated deregulated signalling or pathway cross-talk,
increased mtor activity supports cancer cells by stimulating
the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell growth, proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, nutrient uptake and metabolism.

leukaemia
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all)
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a malignancy of lymphoid
origin, arising from transforming events that occur in early b
cell progenitors. it is the most common cancer in children,
accounting for 35% of new paediatric cancer diagnoses
(plasschaert et al, 2004). unfortunately, 20–25% of children
and 80% of adults with all relapse and the majority of these
patients succumb to their cancer despite aggressive therapy
(plasschaert et al, 2004). current all treatment protocols use
combinations of multiple cytotoxic chemotherapeutics with
overlapping toxicity and the potential for long term sequelae,
especially in the most intensively treated patients. new agents
with activity against all are needed, and targeted biological
agents have the potential to add efficacy without additional
toxicity in patients with refractory all.
as mtis have activity against lymphocytes and abnormal
signalling can lead to neoplastic transformation, our group
hypothesized that all cells may be dependent on mtor
signalling and studied the effects of mtis on all blasts
(brown et al, 2003). we demonstrated that sirolimus inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis in all cell lines and
improved survival in a eu-ret transgenic mouse model of
leukaemia/lymphoma (brown et al, 2003). since that initial
report, the mtor signalling pathway has been extensively
studied by our group and others in preclinical models of all
(brown et al, 2003, 2007; avellino et al, 2005; teachey et al,
2006a, 2008; hirase et al, 2008; houghton et al, 2008). mtis
(sirolimus,  xxxd3307xxx , and  xxxd2072xxx ) have been shown to
be effective not only against cell lines and transgenic mouse
models, but also against primary human all cells using
in vitro (bone marrow stromal cell culture) and in vivo [nonobese diabetic severe comined immunodeficient (nod/scid)
xenografts] models (avellino et al, 2005; teachey et al, 2006a;
crazzolara et al, 2007).
the use of primary human all cells xenografted into
immunodeficient mouse strains, such as nod/scid mice, is a
powerful tool to study all biology and response to therapy.
all cell lines can be useful tools, especially for signal

fig 1. mtor signalling cascade. mtor regulates a number of key cellular processes in mammalian cells, including protein translation. mtor can
bind to gbl, mlst8, pras40, and raptor, forming the mti sensitive complex, mtorc1 (bhaskar & hay, 2007). in comparison, the components
of mtorc2 include mtor, gbl, msin1, rictor, and protor/prr5 (bhaskar & hay, 2007). mtorc2, in concert with pdk1, activates akt by
phosphorylation. activation of growth factor receptors, including il-7r,  xxxg1145xxx , c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx , via insulin, hormones, and growth factors, leads to
activation of  xxxg1198xxx . the activation of  xxxg1198xxx  in turn leads to pi3k upregulation. pi3k can also be activated by directly associating with the growth
factor receptor at the cell membrane. activated pi3k generates pip3, which can recruit akt to the cell membrane so that pdk1 and torc2 can
activate it (wullschleger et al, 2006). the tumour suppressor pten negatively regulates pi3k by dephosphorylating its second messengers, i.e. pip3
(mills et al, 2001). inactivating mutations of pten, which are found in many tumour types, leads to excess activation of akt, mtor, p70s6 kinase 1
( xxxg1989xxx ) and can increase sensitivity to mtor inhibition (neshat et al, 2001). activated akt then can phosphorylate  xxxg2338xxx , resulting in the
inactivation of the  xxxg2337xxx : xxxg2338xxx  complex, allowing for  xxxg1954xxx  to activate mtorc1 (wullschleger et al, 2006). the main downstream targets of
activated mtorc1 are  xxxg1989xxx  and the inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, 4e- xxxg693xxx  (wullschleger et al, 2006). mtorc1 kinase phosphorylates
 xxxg1989xxx . phosphorylated- xxxg1989xxx  induces top-translation and ribosomal biosynthesis and blocks apoptosis by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic
molecule bad. in addition, p- xxxg1989xxx  acts as a negative feedback mechanism for the mtor pathway by down-regulating  xxxg1198xxx  (harrington et al,
2005). mtorc1 regulates cap-dependent protein translation via phosphorylation of 4e- xxxg693xxx  (huang et al, 2003). when hypophosphorylated,  xxxg693xxx  binds tightly to  xxxg692xxx , blocking the association of  xxxg692xxx  with eif-4g. this blocks the formation of the eif-4f translation initiation complex,
which is necessary for cap-dependent translation. when  xxxg693xxx  is phosphorylated by mtorc1, it is released from  xxxg692xxx , thereby facilitating
translational initiation of mrnas for a number of key intracellular proteins, including c-myc,  xxxg366xxx , and  xxxg1626xxx  (faivre et al,
2006).  xxxg366xxx  forms a complex with  xxxg411xxx  ( xxxg411xxx ) which is required for activation via phosphorylation of rb (retinoblastoma
protein) (ewen et al, 1993). mtor also facilitates the elimination of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor  xxxg419xxx  through interactions with  xxxg407xxx ,
allowing cell cycle progression under the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases, including  xxxg365xxx  (faivre et al, 2006). arrows represent activation;

transduction experiments, but they are difficult to establish
from primary blasts, do not represent the heterogeneity of
primary disease, and are thus suboptimal models for many
preclinical studies. nod/scid xenografted all maintains its
phenotypic characteristics even after serial passage and
response of leukaemic blasts to chemotherapeutic agents in
the nod/scid xenograft model has been shown to correlate
directly with human response to therapy (liem et al, 2004).
since treatment response in the mice correlates with human
disease, these models can be used to compare chemotherapeutic responders to non-responders to delineate mechanisms
of resistance. one problem with laboratory investigation of
primary leukaemia cells has been the limited quantity of blasts
for analysis. the nod/scid xenograft model allows for
significant expansion of all in the mouse in order to generate
sufficient quantities of cells for study.
our group has studied the activity of mtis using xenografts
generated from 13 different all patients and found that mtis
were effective in 62% of samples (brown et al, 2008). mtis
appear to be active against both pre-b and pre-t all,
however, they may be most active in pre-t cell disease
(houghton et al, 2008). while mtis have been clearly shown
to kill all cells, debate exists in the literature as to whether it
is through apoptosis or autophagy (avellino et al, 2005;
crazzolara et al, 2007). as more data is accumulating that
suggests all cells are dependent on the pi3k/akt/mtor
signalling pathway, the activity of pi3k inhibitors, akt
inhibitors, and multi-kinase inhibitors (mtor plus pi3k) is
being investigated in all (brown et al, 2008; kharas et al,
2008; levy et al, 2008). also, as cancer cells may become
resistant to mtis through upregulation of other intermediaries
in the pi3k/akt/mtor signalling pathway, combinations of
mtis with pi3k inhibitors and akt inhibitors are being
actively explored to overcome mtor resistance with promising results (breslin et al, 2005; brown et al, 2008; kharas
et al, 2008).
because mtis are less likely to be effective in a clinical
setting when used as single agents against leukaemia, combination treatment is the next logical step in the therapeutic
development of mtis in all. it is important to choose
rationally-designed combinations, building on an understanding of the mechanism(s) of action of mtis in all blasts. mtis
have been shown to be effective and potentially synergistic in
combination with a number of chemotherapeutics in vitro,
including methotrexate, dexamethasone, etoposide,  xxxd230xxx , and doxorubicin (saydam et al, 2005; teachey et al, 2008).
mtis have also been studied in combination with methotrexate and vincristine in vivo using nod/scid models with a
marked response to both combination regimens (crazzolara
et al, 2007; teachey et al, 2008). the combination of  xxxd3307xxx  and methotrexate resulted in cure in some xenografted
animals. all cells treated with  xxxd3307xxx  had marked
reduction of  xxxg366xxx  and  xxxg631xxx , potentially
increasing the sensitivity of all cells to methotrexate and
explaining the combined effect (teachey et al, 2008). while
572

this combination appears extremely promising in preclinical
studies, both methotrexate and mtis can cause mucositis and
clinical trials are needed to determine tolerability. nevertheless,  xxxd2072xxx  and methotrexate have been successfully used
in combination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis without
significant toxicity, including mucositis (bruyn et al, 2008).
another promising combination studied by our group and
others in all is corticosteroids with mtis (wei et al, 2006;
brown et al, 2008; teachey et al, 2008). wei et al (2006)
screened a database of drug-associated gene expression profiles
in all cells to evaluate gene expression signatures of
glucocorticoid sensitivity as compared to resistance. they
found the profile generated by sirolimus matched the signature
of glucocorticoid sensitivity and demonstrated that sirolimus
could restore steroid sensitivity to steroid-resistant all.
similar work performed by other groups suggests that mtis
may reverse glucocorticoid resistance in all cells, an important finding especially since all patients frequently develop
steroid resistance at relapse (gu et al, 2008; haarman et al,
2008).
patients with all that express the philadelphia chromosome (ph + all) have a particularly poor prognosis; however,
the development of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors against bcr-abl
appears promising and will hopefully improve outcome.
resistance to these  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors is a real clinical
concern. because bcr-abl is upstream of the pi3k/akt/
mtor signalling pathway, mtis maybe effective in ph + all,
including bcr-abl tki resistant disease (kharas et al, 2004).
promising data suggests that ph + all cells may be especially
sensitive to mtor inhibition (see section on chronic myeloid
leukaemia below) (hirase et al, 2008; kharas et al, 2008).
based on the preclinical work that investigated mtis in all,
there are a number of on-going clinical trials evaluating mtis
in patients with all as single agents and in combination with
other agents (table i). two phase i/ii trials of mtis in patients
with relapsed or refractory malignancies, including patients
with all, have been completed (yee et al, 2006; rizzieri et al,
2008). both of these trials had one patient each with all and
both patients tolerated therapy, but neither had an objective
response. rheingold et al (2007) recently reported interim
results of an on-going phase 1 trial of sirolimus in children
with relapsed/refractory all. all patients tolerated sirolimus
and three of seven patients had stable disease.
given the potential activity of mtis against all, and
considering that haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(hsct) is used as a major salvage strategy for patients with
relapsed or refractory all and sirolimus has been used as
graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) prophylaxis in a number of
transplant trials, the use of sirolimus in the the post-hsct
setting has been proposed. this was tested in a phase ii study,
with promising results (pulsipher et al, 2008). as a result, the
children’s oncology group has initiated a nationwide phase
iii randomized trial, asct0431, evaluating the addition of
sirolimus to gvhd prophylaxis during hsct for relapsed
all. the primary hypothesis of this trial is that the addition of

sirolimus to gvhd prophylaxis will increase leukaemia-free

the novel benefit of using a drug that has the potential to
both control gvhd and directly suppress leukaemic blasts.
a strategy such as this would be a major advance in
antileukaemia therapy and transplantation.

acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) and myelodysplastic
syndromes (mds)
acute myeloid leukaemia is a clonal disorder of myeloid
haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. while the prognosis for
patients with aml has been poor, in general the outcome has
improved with aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens and
hsct, at the cost of increased toxicities and long-term

sequelae. a number of newer and more targeted agents with
promise are in use and under development, including  xxxd2190xxx ,  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors. nevertheless, the only targeted therapies that
have made significant improvements to date in the prognosis
of aml have been used in patients with acute promyelocytic
leukaemia with the additions of arsenic and all-trans retinoic
acid (sanz et al, 2009).
recent interest has focused on targeting the pi3k/akt/
mtor pathway in aml, as a majority of patient’s blasts have
constitutive activation of akt with subsequent phosphorylation of down-stream targets of mtor, including  xxxg693xxx  and
 xxxg1989xxx  (xu et al, 2003). as direct inhibitors of akt and pi3k
inhibitors remain in early development, the primary focus thus
far has been to evaluate mtis in aml. promising results have

review
been demonstrated using monotherapy with mtis in preclinical models of aml; however, these have not translated into
substantial clinical benefit in early phase trials (recher et al,
2005; yee et al, 2006; perl & carroll, 2007; rizzieri et al, 2008).
this discrepancy may be due to the fact that early phase
clinical trials are performed in patients with more aggressive
disease (relapsed and/or refractory disease), and/or that the
majority of preclinical work testing mtis in aml has occurred
in vitro. until very recently, there were no murine models of
aml that would allow testing of agents in vivo after the
development of measurable disease. prior preclinical work
involved exposing aml cells to drugs in vitro and then testing
the ability of cells to engraft in xenografted animals. this is in
contrast to xenograft models of other haematological diseases,
including all, where agents can be tested in vivo after the
development of measurable disease. despite these findings,
interest remains as targeting the mtor pathway may enhance
the cytotoxicity of existing chemotherapeutic agents and other
targeted agents. xu et al (2005a) demonstrated that sirolimus
enhanced the sensitivity of aml blasts to etoposide in vitro
and the combination could prevent engraftment of aml cells
in nod/scid mice better than either single agent alone if cells
were treated in vitro prior to injection. other groups have
demonstrated that blocking mtor increases the sensitivity of
aml cells to hdac (histone deacetylase) inhibitors and
inhibitors of glycolysis (xu et al, 2005b; nishioka et al, 2008).
as other inhibitors of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway are
developed and tested in clinical trials, these agents may prove
superior to mtis, because targeting pi3k with  xxxd2523xxx , akt
with  xxxd2886xxx , and both mtor and pi3k with the dual
inhibitor  xxxd2942xxx  have shown promise in preclinical studies (xu
et al, 2003; papa et al, 2008; park et al, 2008). because
combination therapy with mtis and either cytotoxics or
biologicals may be beneficial in patients with aml, clinical
trials testing mtis in aml are actively enrolling patients
(table i). at the university of pennsylvania, a phase i/ii trial
of sirolimus plus etoposide, mitoxantrone, and  xxxd1790xxx  has
compelling preliminary data and is being broadened into a
multi-centre randomized trial (luger et al, 2006). in addition,
trials using mtis in elderly patients with aml who cannot
tolerate more aggressive cytotoxic therapy and in combination
with cytotoxics or biological agents in relapsed or refractory
aml are ongoing (table i).
myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogenous group of
disorders characterized by cytopenias caused by defects in
haematopoietic stem cell differentiation which frequently
transform into aml. patients are classified by the international prognostic scoring system (ipss) into low, intermediate
(groups 1 and 2), and high prognostic risk groups based on
patient characteristics, pathology, and tumour biology (greenberg et al, 1997). as pi3k/akt/mtor signalling has been
shown to be important in cellular proliferation and malignant
transformation, follo et al (2007) hypothesized that aberrant
activation of these survival signals may lead to transformation
of mds into aml. this group found that mtor and its
574

downstream intermediates,  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg693xxx , were activated
in high risk mds patients (ipss: intermediate risk group-2 and
high risk) and were not activated in low risk patients
(intermediate risk group-1 and low risk). they also found
that sirolimus was effective in vitro against the cd34+ cells
from high risk patients but not those from low risk or normal
controls. mtis were noted to be active in some patients with
mds, resulting in either stable disease or improvement in
cytopenias in early phase clinic trials and additional trials are
under development (yee et al, 2006; rizzieri et al, 2008).

chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll)
cll is the most common form of leukaemia and arises
from transforming events in cd5+ b cells. with aggressive
chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and novel therapeutics,
including monoclonal antibodies, the prognosis for cll has
improved; however, it remains largely an incurable disease
(lin, 2008). two cell populations are thought to exist in
cll: a very large non-proliferating population of peripheral
blood b lymphocytes and a smaller pool of cycling
malignant b cells found in pseudofollicles in lymph nodes,
spleen, and bone marrow (dighiero & hamblin, 2008). the
crux of targeted therapy is currently directed at the smaller
cycling compartment.
as mtis have been shown to inhibit proliferation of
malignant and non-malignant b lymphocytes and because
pi3k was found to be constitutively active in cll cells from
patients, it has been hypothesized that targeting the pi3k/
akt/mtor signalling pathway may be effective in patients
with cll (ringshausen et al, 2002, 2005). preclinical studies
have shown that mtis do not induce apoptosis in cll cells
but can cause cell cycle arrest through targeting the expression
of cyclins d3, e, a and survivin (decker et al, 2003;
ringshausen et al, 2005). in addition, sirolimus was shown
to improve survival in a cll transgenic mouse generated by
overexpressing tcl1a under the control of the l immunoglobulin gene enhancer (zanesi et al, 2006). these preclinical
studies led to a phase i clinical trial of  xxxd2072xxx  in patients
with cll (decker et al, 2008). three patients on this trial had
stable disease and one patient had a partial response.
unfortunately, this trial was stopped after only seven patients
were enrolled because four patients developed opportunistic
infections. patients on this trial did not receive infectious
prophylaxis, and all had received aggressive and immunosuppressive regimens prior to  xxxd2072xxx . interestingly, a high
infectious risk has not been seen in other trials using
 xxxd2072xxx  even when used in combination with other
immunosuppressives, including corticosteroids and ciclosporin (dunn & croom, 2006; decker et al, 2008). smith et al
(2008) recently presented similar preliminary results from a
phase ii non-randomized single institution trial at m.d.
anderson, demonstrating stable disease and partial responses
in a number of patients with cll who were treated with
 xxxd3307xxx . infections were noted but not to a degree that

review
required the trial to be stopped. other clinical trials using
mtis in cll are ongoing (table i).

chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml)
chronic myeloid leukaemia is a myeloproliferative disorder
characterized by malignant cells with a bcr- xxxg23xxx  (9;22)
translocation. the bcr- xxxg23xxx  oncogene in cml encodes a
210 kda oncoprotein, whereas in ph + all the translocation
produces a 190 kda oncoprotein. both fusion proteins have
aberrant  xxxg2198xxx  activity (piccaluga et al, 2007). prior
to the development of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) with
activity against bcr-abl, cml was only curable with hsct.
over the past few years, complete responses have been
documented with a number of targeted agents, including
imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx , and front-line use of a tki is
now the standard of care for the disease (gora-tybor & robak,
2008). imatinib was the first tki to be used in cml;
unfortunately, approximately 25% of patients will either have
innate resistance or more commonly acquire resistance to
imatinib, because of bcr-abl mutations (gora-tybor & robak,
2008). the majority of these patients will respond to second
line tkis, but a subset have a particular mutation (t3151) that
is not treatable with current bcr-abl targeting tkis (goratybor & robak, 2008). three reasons to develop alternative
agents for patients with cml are: (i) to treat those with
resistant disease; (ii) to identify relatively non-toxic agents that
target pathways down-stream of bcr-abl and could be used in
combination with bcr-abl targeting tkis front-line in certain
high-risk patients to potentially prevent the development of
resistant clones; (iii) to treat patients in accelerated phase or
blast crisis as they have a particularly poor prognosis and
are less likely to respond to bcr-abl targeting tkis as
monotherapy.
multiple groups have demonstrated that mtor-dependent
pathways are activated in bcr-abl transformed cells both in cml
and in ph + all (ly et al, 2003; kim et al, 2005; mayerhofer
et al, 2005). bcr-abl has been shown to regulate translation of
critical targets in cml, including s6 and 4ebp-1 via mtor (ly
et al, 2003). in preclinical studies, sirolimus has been shown to
not only be effective when used as a single agent against bcr-abl
transformed cells, but also to be potentially synergistic when
combined with imatinib (mohi et al, 2004; mayerhofer et al,
2005). sirolimus has also been shown to be effective in vitro
against resistant cml, including cells with t3151 mutations
(sillaber et al, 2008). similar results have been described in
ph + all (hirase et al, 2008; kharas et al, 2008). accordingly,
clinical trials are underway using mtis in patients with relapsed/
refractory cml and ph + all. sillaber et al (2008) treated six
patients with imatinib-resistant cml with sirolimus and two
patients had a major response and two others had a minor
response. wetzler et al recently completed a phase i–ii study of
 xxxd2072xxx  in combination with imatinib in patients with
imatinib-resistant cml (nct00093639). results of this trial
are not currently available.

other haematological malignancies
targeting mtor signalling has also been investigated in hodgkin (hl) and non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and multiple myeloma.
arguably, the subtype of lymphoma that has been the most
studied and has the most potential for clinical benefit from
targeting mtor is mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) (younes, 2008).
mcl is an extremely aggressive and incurable form of b cell
lymphoma with a median overall survival of 3–5 years (schmidt
& dreyling, 2008). mcl is characterized by a t(11;14) translocation juxtaposing  xxxg366xxx  with the immunoglobulin heavy
chain, resulting in increased production of  xxxg366xxx  (hartmann
et al, 2008).  xxxg366xxx  is a down-stream target of mtor and
mtis can inhibit the cap-dependent translation of this protein in
many cell types (hipp et al, 2005). accordingly, hipp et al (2005)
hypothesized that targeting mtor would be an effective
treatment in mcl by down-regulating  xxxg366xxx  expression.
they found that sirolimus was effective against mcl cell lines
in vitro; however, while other cyclins (d3, e, and a) were
reduced,  xxxg366xxx  expression did not change (hipp et al, 2005).
subsequent work by rudelius et al (2006), demonstrated
that akt, mtor, and a number of mtor down-stream
signalling intermediates are constitutively activated in mcl,
giving an alternative explanation for the potential effectiveness of targeting akt/pi3k/mtor signalling; these results
were confirmed by peponi et al (2006). other preclinical
work has demonstrated that mtis synergize in vitro with a
number of agents used to treat mcl, including rituximab,
vincristine, doxorubicin, and bortezomib (haritunians et al,
2007). these findings led to a phase ii trial of  xxxd3307xxx 
in patients with relapsed lymphoma. results from this study
are impressive, with a 41% overall response rate and a
median time to progression of 6 months (ansell et al, 2008).
based on these results, additional trials are underway
(table i).
akt and the down-stream intermediates,  xxxg693xxx  and  xxxg1989xxx ,
were shown to be activated in hl cell lines; however, targeting
either pi3k with  xxxd2523xxx  or mtor with sirolimus only
showed a modest effect in vitro. nevertheless, a combination of
doxorubicin and sirolimus was found to be synergistic and
profoundly inhibited the same cell lines (dutton et al, 2005).
a more pronounced single agent effect was demonstrated in a
nod/scid xenograft model of hl treated with  xxxd2072xxx 
(jundt et al, 2005). mtor has also been shown to be activated
in follicular lymphoma through a syk-dependent mechanism,
and sirolimus has some activity in follicular lymphoma cell
lines (calastretti et al, 2001; leseux et al, 2008). similarly,
mtor and its intermediates have been shown to be activated
in alk-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma and mtor
inhibition is effective in preclinical models of the disease
(jundt et al, 2005; vega et al, 2006). chumsri et al (2008)
reported that treating a patient with refractory cutaneous
anaplastic large cell lymphoma with sirolimus resulted in a
durable complete response. targeting mtor has also been

review
shown to be effective in preclinical models of diffuse large b
cell lymphoma (wanner et al, 2006). all of these studies have
led to a number of phase i-iii clinical trials of mtis as single
agents or in combination in aggressive and/or refractory
lymphomas (table i).
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (ptld) is a
rare but serious complication of transplantation (solid organ
or hsct), resulting from a defective cytotoxic t cell response
to viral infection, primarily epstein–barr virus (ebv), in the
setting of chronic immunosuppression (lewin, 1997). the
goals of treatment are to reduce and/or alter immunosuppression to allow partial t cell recovery and/or to target the
ebv-infected b cells with rituximab or anti-viral agents
(lewin, 1997). some patients with ptld have very aggressive
disease with transformation to lymphoma and need definitive
chemotherapy. recently, el-salem et al (2007) demonstrated
constitutive activation of mtor signalling in patients with
ptld, regardless of the ebv genome expression status, and
preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mtis in
ptld (majewski et al, 2003; el-salem et al, 2007). accordingly, a number of investigators have changed immunosuppression to mtis in ptld patients (sirolimus and  xxxd2072xxx )
with improvement in ptld and, in some cases, documented
complete responses (pascual, 2007; boratynska & smolska,
2008).
multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy characterized
by monoclonal proliferation of b cells producing a single
immunoglobulin and affecting bone marrow and osseous bone
(kyle & rajkumar, 2008). treatment has improved over the
past decade with the introduction of thalidomide (and
thalidomide analogues) and bortezomib; however, even with
these agents, aggressive chemotherapy, and stem cell transplant, median overall survival is 2 years in patients with highrisk disease (kyle & rajkumar, 2008). the pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway is altered frequently in multiple myeloma with
constitutive activation of akt and loss of pten function
(pene et al, 2002; shi et al, 2002). akt and pi3k inhibitors
have profound effects against multiple myeloma in preclinical
models; however, mtis were found to have lesser effects,
demonstrating efficacy in cells with loss of pten function but
showing significantly less activity in cells with normal pten
function (pene et al, 2002; shi et al, 2002; hideshima et al,
2006).  xxxd3307xxx  demonstrated efficacy in a xenograft
model of multiple myeloma. in other studies, sirolimus was
found to sensitize multiple myeloma cells to dexamethasone,
and mtis were found to synergize with other targeted agents,
including sunitinib, a hsp90 inhibitor, and lenalidomide
(frost et al, 2004; raje et al, 2004; francis et al, 2006; ikezoe
et al, 2006; yan et al, 2006). clinical trials in multiple
myeloma are ongoing (table i).

non-malignant haematological disorders
in addition to the recent interest of mtis in haematological
malignancies, targeting mtor signalling has been studied in
576

non-malignant haematological disorders, particularly autoimmune disorders, for two reasons: (i) mtis can cause
apoptosis in abnormal lymphocytes, whereas many immunosuppressive agents only inhibit growth; and (ii) mtis increase
peripheral blood regulatory t cells (tregs). tregs are a t cell
population that suppresses the immune system. tregs are
frequently decreased in autoimmune diseases and increasing
tregs may improve autoimmune disorders (brusko et al,
2008). we have studied the activity of sirolimus in a rare
paediatric haematological disorder, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (alps). alps is a disorder of disrupted
lymphocyte homeostasis caused by defective fas-mediated
apoptosis, leading to chronic lymphoproliferation, systemic
autoimmunity, and a propensity to develop secondary cancers
(bleesing et al, 2000). the most common autoimmune
manifestation is autoimmune cytopenias and many patients
have severe disease. we hypothesized that targeting mtor
would be effective in alps through inducing apoptosis in the
abnormal lymphocytes found in the disease and/or by
increasing tregs. we found marked improvement in lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity following the treatment of
murine models of alps (teachey et al, 2006b). based on those
results, we have treated six refractory alps patients with
sirolimus and found profound improvement in all patients
with complete responses in the majority of patients (teachey
et al, 2009). we have an open clinical trial for alps patients
and plan to expand the trial to include patients with chronic
severe and/or refractory autoimmune cytopenias either as an
idiopathic condition (immune thrombocytopenic purpura,
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune neutropenia,
or evans syndrome) or as a consequence of a syndrome
(systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease).
sirolimus has also been used as a immunosuppressive
salvage regimen in patients who develop transplant-associated
microangiopathy or autoimmune cytopenias (teachey d.t.,
jubelirer t., baluarte h.j., wade a. and manno c.s., in
preparation; yango et al, 2002). finally, mtis are under
investigation in preclinical models and/or clinical trials in
aplastic anaemia and for haematological manifestations of
systemic lupus erythematosis (tisdale et al, 2000; ramosbarron et al, 2007).

conclusion
interest in mtis has grown considerably over the recent years
as the important role of mtor signal transduction in cell
growth and proliferation has become better elucidated. as
a class, mtis are safe and well-tolerated. because aberrant
activation of the akt/pi3k/mtor signalling network is a
common finding in many haematological and non-malignant
diseases, mtis have the potential to be efficacious in a variety
of disorders. to date, mtis have demonstrated substantial
activity against abnormal haematopoietic cells of multiple
lineages. nevertheless, as mtis are unlikely to be curative as

single agents in many malignancies, elucidating the most
effective way of combining mtis with conventional cytotoxic
agents and new targeted therapies is imperative in order to
improve cure rates in these difficult-to-treat diseases.
