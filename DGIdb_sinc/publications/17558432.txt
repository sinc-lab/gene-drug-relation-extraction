background and purpose: rodent a2a-adrenoceptors bind the classical a2-antagonists yohimbine and rauwolscine with lower
affinity than the human a2a-adrenoceptor. a serine-cysteine difference in the fifth transmembrane helix (tm; position 5.43)
partially explains this, but all determinants of the interspecies binding selectivity are not known. molecular models of
a2a-adrenoceptors suggest that the second extracellular loop (xl2) folds above the binding cavity and may participate
in antagonist binding.
experimental approach: amino acids facing the binding cavity were identified using molecular models: side chains of residues
5.43 in  xxxg2318xxx  and xl2.49 and xl2.51 in xl2 differ between the mouse and human receptors. reciprocal mutations were made in
mouse and human a2a-adrenoceptors at positions 5.43, xl2.49 and xl2.51, and tested with a set of thirteen chemically diverse
ligands in competition binding assays.
key results: reciprocal effects on the binding of yohimbine and rauwolscine in human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors were
observed for mutations at 5.43, xl2.49 and xl2.51. the binding profile of rs-79948-197 was reversed only by the xl2 substitutions.
conclusions and implications: positions 5.43, xl2.49 and xl2.51 are major determinants of the species preference for
yohimbine and rauwolscine of the human versus mouse a2a-adrenoceptors. residues at positions xl2.49 and xl2.51 determine
the binding preference of rs-79948-197 for the human a2a-adrenoceptor. thus, xl2 is involved in determining the species
preferences of a2a-adrenoceptors of human and mouse for some antagonists.

introduction
the a2-adrenoceptors, members of the rhodopsin-like family
of g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), are involved in
many physiological processes through their activation by the
neurotransmitters/hormones noradrenaline and adrenaline.
for example, a2-adrenoceptors mediate feedback inhibition
of catecholamine release in sympathetic nerve endings,
vascular smooth muscle contraction and central regulation
of blood pressure (link et al., 1996; macmillan et al., 1996;
altman et al., 1999). the a2-adrenoceptors are currently

targeted by several clinically important drugs, including
clonidine and dexmedetomidine, but a better understanding
of the structural determinants of selectivity among the
a2-adrenoceptor subtypes would have obvious therapeutic
applications. for example, subtype-selective agonists and
antagonists could possibly improve the treatment of hypertension, depression, pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms
(ruffolo and hieble, 1994; macdonald et al., 1997).
in mammals, three distinct genes encode three a2-adrenoceptor subtypes, named a2a, a2b and a2c. they differ in their
patterns of tissue expression and mechanisms of regulation
(eason et al., 1994; macdonald et al., 1997; richman et al.,
2001). recently, in zebrafish, we have identified a fourth
a2-adrenoceptor subtype present as two duplicates that has
no ortholog in mammals; this new subtype is present in
many other fish species as well as in some tetrapods
(ruuskanen et al., 2004). in accordance with iuphar rules,

1294

xl2 affects yohimbine binding to a2a-adrenoceptors
jmm laurila et al

we have named the duplicates of this new receptor subtype
a2da- and a2db-adrenoceptors (ruuskanen et al., 2004;
bylund, 2005).
the three mammalian a2-adrenoceptor subtypes bind the
endogenous catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline
with similar affinities, while their binding affinities for nonnatural ligands may differ (uhlén et al., 1998; molderings
et al., 2000; bylund, 2005). in addition, when orthologs of a
given a2-adrenoceptor subtype are compared between species, the ligand binding affinities may also differ, for
example, the murine and rat a2a-adrenoceptor subtypes bind
the classical a2-antagonists yohimbine and rauwolscine
with lower affinity in comparison to the orthologous
a2a-adrenoceptor subtypes of several other species, for example,
human, pig, rabbit and zebrafish (link et al., 1992; bylund,
2005; ruuskanen et al., 2005). indeed, based on these
pharmacological differences, the rodent a2a-adrenoceptor
was at one time called the a2d-adrenoceptor (michel et al.,
1989; simonneaux et al., 1991).
rodents are frequently used as animal models in pharmaceutical development. it is therefore important to understand, on the molecular level, the origin of their
pharmacological differences from humans. currently, a
detailed experimental structure of an adrenoceptor is still
lacking, hampering our understanding of the origin of
specificity of different drug molecules for diverse receptors,
receptor subtypes and species variants. adrenoceptors, like
other gpcrs, fold into a bundle of seven hydrophobic
transmembrane a-helices (tm1–tm7), as seen in the bovine
rhodopsin structure (palczewski et al., 2000), the only highresolution gpcr structure known so far. in rhodopsin, the
photoactivatable 11-cis-retinal ligand binds within a pocket
embedded within the protein core and formed by amino
acids from tm2–tm7. for the adrenoceptors, a similar
location of the binding site was predicted long ago and is
now commonly accepted (wong et al., 1988; trumppkallmeyer et al., 1992). earlier studies have focused on the
amino-acid differences along the tms in order to explain the
distinct pharmacology of the murine a2a-adrenoceptor
compared to its human ortholog. a serine-cysteine aminoacid substitution in  xxxg2318xxx  (position 5.43) only partly explains
the species-specific differences between the human and
rodent a2a-adrenoceptors in the recognition of yohimbine
and rauwolscine (link et al., 1992; bylund, 2005). in
this paper, amino-acid residues are numbered according to
the ballesteros–weinstein nomenclature (ballesteros and
weinstein, 1995). in this indexing system, the first number
refers to the transmembrane helix where the residue is
located and the number after the decimal point refers to the
residue position with respect to the most conserved residue
in that helix, which has been arbitrarily assigned
the number 50. the ballesteros–weinstein numbering
scheme was extended to the second extracellular loop; thus,
the conserved cysteine in xl2 that forms a putative
disulphide bond is indicated as cxl2.50 (xhaard et al., 2005).
in rhodopsin, the second extracellular loop (xl2) that
connects tm4 and  xxxg2318xxx  folds down between the transmembrane domains and forms part of the binding site, in direct
contact with 11-cis-retinal (palczewski et al., 2000; teller
et al., 2001; okada et al., 2002). a disulphide bond between
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1293–1304

cysteines at positions 3.25 and xl2.50 (see above for
numbering convention extended to xl2) constrains the
position of xl2 in rhodopsin. as these cysteines are
conserved among most rhodopsin-like gpcrs, the disulphide bond would very likely be present and serve to
constrain the xl2 domain to a similar location ‘above’ the
binding cavity in many gpcrs, including the a2-adrenoceptors. the structure of rhodopsin and molecular models of the
a2-adrenoceptors suggest that residues in xl2, especially in
the vicinity of the cysteine at xl2.50, may contribute to the
differences in ligand binding among a2-adrenoceptors from
different subtypes and species (ruuskanen et al., 2005;
xhaard et al., 2005). experimental evidence has been
reported for other types of gpcrs where determinants of
the binding affinities for amine ligands were attributed to
xl2 (zhao et al., 1996; wurch et al., 1998; shi and javitch,
2004).
in this study, we have investigated in more detail the
interspecies differences between the human and mouse
a2a-adrenoceptors. reciprocal mutations were generated
for arginine/serine (human/mouse) at xl2.49 (residue 187
in both human and mouse; located adjacent to the conserved
cysteine, residue 188, at position xl2.50) and glutamate/
lysine at xl2.51 (residue 189), as well as for cysteine/serine at
position 5.43 (residue 201). a panel of 13 structurally diverse
ligands was selected and tested with transfected recombinant
cells expressing wild-type and mutated a2a-adrenoceptors.
ten of these ligands are antagonists, among which arc239,
atipamezole, wb4101, rauwolscine, rs-79948-197 and
yohimbine discriminated between the human and mouse
receptors with at least threefold differences in affinity. the
four remaining antagonists, chlorpromazine, doxazosin,
mk-912 and  xxxd3000xxx , served as controls to rule out any
indiscriminate effects of the mutations, as they are known to
bind to mouse and human a2a-adrenoceptors with similar
affinities. an earlier modelling study (xhaard et al., 2006)
had suggested a potential role for xl2, also in agonist
binding. therefore, we tested the effects of the mutations
within xl2 on the affinity of the a2-adrenoceptors for the
endogenous catecholamines adrenaline, noradrenaline and
dopamine. we show that reciprocal substitutions at positions 5.43, xl2.49 and xl2.51 reverse the binding profiles of
human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors for yohimbine, rauwolscine and rs-79948-197, indicating a role of xl2 in the
determination of species-specific ligand binding profiles.

methods
molecular modelling of the binding cavities, human–mouse
comparisons and construction of receptor–ligand complexes
the amino acids facing the binding cavity were defined
using modelled receptor–ligand complexes. structural models
of individual receptors were constructed as reported
previously (nyrönen et al., 2001; xhaard et al., 2005, 2006).
briefly, bovine rhodopsin solved at 2.6 å resolution in the
inactive state was used as a structural template (palczewski
et al., 2000; okada et al., 2002; li et al., 2004; pdb codes
1f88, 1hzx, 1l9h). the inactive state of bovine rhodopsin
should be well suited to model the site where antagonists

jmm laurila et al

bind (bissantz et al., 2003; xhaard et al., 2005). in order
to construct the models, pairwise sequence alignments
obtained previously using malign (johnson and overington,
1993) and corrected manually were used, and the models
were constructed using modeller v8.0 (sali and blundell,
1993) with the standard options.
the antagonists yohimbine, rauwolscine, rs-79948-197
and mk-912 (see figure 1 for ligand structures) were
manually docked into structural models of the human and
mouse a2a-adrenoceptors in two different ways; first, based
on the classical hypothesis of ion pairing between d3.32 and
the protonated amine of the ligands, and secondly, using the
alternative hypothesis proposed by xhaard et al. (2005)
based on cation–p interactions. before docking, the threedimensional structures of yohimbine (csd code: yohimb,
yohimb10) were taken from the cambridge structure
database (csd) and the three-dimensional structures of
rauwolscine, rs-79948-197 and mk-912, which are not

1295

available in the csd, were constructed using sybyl (tripos
corp., st louis, mo, usa).

mutagenesis and expression vectors
a human a2a-adrenoceptor cdna clone was obtained from
the umr cdna resource center (university of missouri-rolla,
rolla, mo, usa). the murine a2a-adrenoceptor cdna
clone was originally provided by dr bk kobilka (stanford
university, stanford, ca, usa; clone ma2-10h; link et al.,
1992).
the human a2a-adrenoceptor wild-type cdna was cloned
into the pcdna3.1 þ expression vector (invitrogen, nv
leek, the netherlands). the cdnas encoding the murine
wild-type and s5.43c-mutated a2a-adrenoceptors were
subcloned into pcdna3.1 þ from expression constructs
in prep4 (marjamäki et al., 1998). mutagenesis primers
were obtained from tag copenhagen a/s (copenhagen,
denmark). site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing
the gene editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system
(promega, madison, wi, usa). the mutated expression
vector constructs were sequenced with vector- and genespecific primers to confirm the correctness of the sequence
and the success of the desired xl2 mutations.

cell culture and transfections
adherent chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells (k1 strain)
(american type culture collection, manassas, va, usa) were
cultured in a-minimum essential medium supplemented
with 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm nahco3, 5% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 u ml1) and streptomycin
(50 mg ml1). cells were grown in 5% co2 at 371c. cho cells
expressing human c5.43s-mutated a2a-adrenoceptors, reported previously (peltonen et al., 2003), were revived from
liquid nitrogen and cultured. the pcdna3.1 þ -based expression constructs were transfected into cho cells using the
lipofectamine 2000 reagent kit (invitrogen life technologies
inc., rockville, md, usa) with slight modifications to the
manufacturer’s instructions. stable transfections were
selected using 800 mg ml1 of the neomycin analogue  xxxg418xxx 
(calbiochem, san diego, ca, usa). after selection, transfected cell cultures were examined for their ability to bind
the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand [3h]rx821002
(see below). the transfected cell clones with the highest
expression levels were chosen for further competition
binding studies and were subsequently maintained in
200 mg ml1  xxxg418xxx . confluent cells were harvested into
chilled phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted and frozen at
701c.

membrane preparation
all procedures were performed on ice. the harvested
recombinant cho cell pellets were thawed and suspended
in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm tris-hcl, 0.1 mm edta,
0.32 mm sucrose, ph 7.4) and homogenized using an ultraturrax homogeniser (3  10 s at 800 r.p.m.). the homogenate
was centrifuged at 23 000 g for 30 min, and the pellet was
re-homogenized and again centrifuged at 23 000 g for 30 min.

the membrane pellet was suspended in hypotonic lysis
buffer and stored at 701c until used. protein concentrations were determined with the method of bradford (1976)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as reference.

saturation binding assays
the receptor expression levels of the transfected cell lines
were determined in saturation binding experiments using
the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist [3h]rx821002 as radioligand. saturation binding assays were performed as described
previously (halme et al., 1995). briefly, whole-cell homogenates (40–120 mg of protein per sample) or membrane
preparations (4–20 mg of protein per sample) were incubated
(in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) with final
concentrations of [3h]rx821002 ranging from 0.125 to 8 nm.
after 30 min incubation at 251c, reactions were terminated
using rapid filtration through glass fibre filters (whatman
gf/b). the filters were washed (50 mm tris-hcl, 10 mm
edta, ph 7.4), placed into scintillation vials with optiphase
‘hisafe’ iii (wallac oy, turku, finland) and bound radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (wallac
1410). nonspecific binding was defined in parallel tubes
with  xxxd2914xxx  (10 mm). specific binding was defined as
the difference between total and nonspecific binding. for
each studied cell line, saturation experiments were performed at least three times. the bmax values were different
between the cell lines, but no relationship between the
observed expression levels and kd values for [3h]rx821002
was seen. equilibrium dissociation constants (kd) and
receptor expression levels (bmax) were calculated from
saturation binding experiments (graphpad prism software,
san diego, ca, usa).

competition binding assays
competition binding assays were carried out using two
systems: either a beckman biomek 2000 laboratory automation workstation (beckman instruments inc., palo alto,
ca, usa) with 96-well plates, or a multiscreen vacuum
manifold system (millipore corporation, bedford, ma, usa)
with millipore multiscreen fb 96-well filtration plates. the
affinities of adrenaline,  xxxd3000xxx , yohimbine and rauwolscine at c5.43s-substituted human a2a-adrenoceptors were
determined using both systems, with an excellent correlation (r ¼ 0.99) between the results obtained, indicating that
the type of system had no significant influence on the
outcome. competition binding experiments were performed
in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) using
[3h]rx821002 at concentrations close to its affinity constant
(kd) for each receptor variant, 6–8 serial dilutions of
the competitor ligands, and cell membrane preparations
with 2–10 mg of protein per sample. after 30 min incubation
at room temperature, reactions were terminated by rapid
vacuum filtration. filters were washed three times with icecold buffer, dried and impregnated with meltilex b/hs
scintillation wax (1205-422, wallac, turku, finland) or super
mix cocktail (wallac), depending on the system used. the
incorporated radioactivity was determined in a wallac 1205
or wallac 1450 betaplate liquid scintillation counter.
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1293–1304

ligands included in the competition binding assays were
chosen on the basis of their chemical structure: some ‘bulky
antagonists’ (arc239, doxazosin,  xxxd3000xxx , wb4101), the
imidazole atipamezole, the tricyclic antipsychotic drug
chlorpromazine, yohimbine and its structural analogues
rauwolscine, mk-912 and rs-79948-197. in addition,
endogenous catecholamines were tested (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine). the apparent affinity (apparent ki) of
each ligand was determined using nonlinear regression
analysis (graphpad prism), assuming one-site binding. for
conversion of ic50 into ki values, the cheng–prusoff
equation was applied (cheng and prusoff, 1973). the
statistical significance of affinity differences between receptor variants was evaluated with unpaired t-tests.

materials
[3h]rx821002 was purchased from amersham pharmacia
biotech (bucks, uk). arc239 and rs-79948-197 were
obtained from tocris (bristol, uk). mk-912 (l-657.743) was
a gift from merck & co. (whitehouse station, nj, usa), and
atipamezole was a gift from orion pharma (turku, finland).
other ligands were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st louis,
mo, usa). cell culture reagents were supplied by life
technologies inc. (rockville, md, usa). other reagents were
of analytical or reagent grade and were purchased from
commercial suppliers.

results
identification of amino acids likely to face the ligand-binding
cavity: tm regions and xl2
adrenoceptors bind their endogenous ligands adrenaline
and noradrenaline inside a binding cavity that has been
defined over the last 20 years (dixon et al., 1987; strader
et al., 1987; schwartz, 1994). there is compelling evidence
that this cavity is located within the tm region, surrounded
by tm2–tm7. this notion is based on several lines of
evidence, including site-directed mutagenesis studies combined with modified ligands, studies based on cysteinereactive probes (nyrönen et al., 2001; peltonen et al., 2003),
and consideration of the three-dimensional structure of the
distant but recognizably similar rhodopsin (wong et al.,
1988), whose ligand-bound complex is now known. the
location of the site of antagonist binding is less well defined
than that of agonists, and some bound antagonists may only
partially overlap with the location of bound agonists.
most of the amino acids forming the agonist binding site
are located in the tms (salminen et al., 1999; nyrönen et al.,
2001; xhaard et al., 2005, 2006). for endogenous agonists,
the amino acids predicted to face the ligand in the human
a2a-adrenoceptor are from tm2 (v2.53 and v2.57); from
 xxxg2318xxx  (c3.25, y3.28, d3.32, v3.33, c3.36, t3.37 and i3.40);
from tm4 (i4.52, i4.56 and p4.60); from  xxxg2318xxx  (y5.38, v5.39,
s5.42, c5.43, s5.46 and f5.47); from tm6 (f6.44, w6.48,
f6.51, f6.52 and y6.55); and from tm7 (f7.39, g7.42, y7.43
and n7.45). for antagonists, the most common way to place
(dock) them in the binding cavity is to form an ion pair
between a positively charged nitrogen of the ligand and the

xl2 affects yohimbine binding to a2a-adrenoceptors
jmm laurila et al

side chain of d3.32 in the receptor (strader et al., 1987),
based on analogy with agonist binding. such a binding mode
shifts the location of the antagonist ligands away from  xxxg2318xxx 
and positions them close to tm1 (xhaard et al., 2005); thus,
gpcrs modelled on the basis of the rhodopsin structure
would require expansion of the agonist binding site in order
to accommodate antagonists. for example, surgand et al.
(2006) suggest that l1.35, a1.39, l1.42, i2.58, s2.61 and
e2.65 in the monoamine receptors face antagonist ligands in
this expanded binding site. alternatively, other binding
modes for antagonists have been proposed that do not
require an expanded binding site: we have suggested (xhaard
et al., 2005), based on automatic docking and supported by
the covalent binding of the antagonist phenoxybenzamine
to c3.36 (frang et al., 2001), that antagonists also could fully
occupy the ‘agonist’ binding pocket and take advantage of
cation–p interactions and carboxylate–ring interactions that
would effectively replace the classical ion pair seen for
agonist–receptor interactions.
the second extracellular loop, xl2, folds as a b-hairpin
and covers the binding cavity in the x-ray structure of
bovine rhodopsin, where it interacts directly with the
endogenously bound ligand 11-cis-retinal. in rhodopsin,
cysteine cxl2.50 in xl2 is attached to cysteine c3.25 in  xxxg2318xxx 
with a disulphide bridge; cysteine xl2.50 and its neighbouring residues are thus constrained to form the extracellular
surface – the ‘top’ – of the binding cavity. as cysteines c3.25
and cxl2.50 are conserved among the gpcrs, it is very likely
that xl2 is similarly constrained and forms the ‘top’ of the
binding cavity in the a2-adrenoceptors, too (figure 2). in the
d2 dopamine receptor, a close relative of the a2-adrenoceptors (xhaard et al., 2006), xl2 has been shown by a sitedirected cysteine accessibility study to be exposed to the
binding cavity (shi and javitch, 2004). thus, in the modelled
structures of the human a2a-adrenoceptor, the side chains of
the amino acids neighbouring xl2.50, that is, rxl2.49,
exl2.51 and ixl2.52, as well as some main-chain atoms from
xl2.49–xl2.52, are likely to form the extracellular surface of
the binding site where they could participate in important
interactions with ligands.

comparisons of the binding cavities of the modelled human
and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors
the predicted binding cavities of the a2a-adrenoceptors of
human and mouse (or rat; mouse and rat a2a-adrenoceptors
have identical amino acids facing the binding cavity) are
very similar: the amino acids facing the binding cavities are
identical except for three, that is, c5.43, rxl2.49 and exl2.51
in the human receptor and s5.43, sxl2.49 and kxl2.51 in the
mouse and rat receptors (figure 3). in the extended binding
cavity model of surgand et al. (2006), the number of
differences in the binding site does not increase, since all
amino acids closest to the binding cavity in tm1, tm2 and
tm7 are identical in the human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors. based on the comparison of the mouse and human a2aadrenoceptors, we have focused on the three amino acids
that are different within the binding cavity. we have
introduced replacements in the human and mouse receptors
by site-directed mutagenesis and tested their effects on

ligand binding. five mutants were constructed: a human
a2a-adrenoceptor with two mutations in xl2 (rxl2.49s
and exl2.51k) and the reciprocal mouse a2a-adrenoceptor
double mutant (sxl2.49r and kxl2.51e); a human  xxxg2318xxx  mutant
(c5.43s) and the reciprocal mouse  xxxg2318xxx  mutant (s5.43c). in
order to validate the results of the double mutants, an
additional mouse receptor construct was mutated at all three
positions (s5.43c, sxl2.49r and kxl2.51e).

here, in table 2 and figure 3, receptor variants are named based on the amino
acids at positions 5.43/xl2.49/xl2.51, for example, c/r/e for the human wildtype a2a-adrenoceptor.

a2a-adrenoceptor by about 20-fold over the mouse ortholog,
while for yohimbine this ratio was 15-fold. another four
antagonist compounds discriminated moderately between
the human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors: wb4101 (sevenfold) and rs-79948-197 (fourfold) preferred the human
a2a-adrenoceptor, while arc239 (o4-fold) and atipamezole
(o4-fold) preferred the mouse ortholog.
the apparent affinities of another four antagonists,
doxazosin, chlorpromazine, mk-912 and  xxxd3000xxx , were
similar with at most twofold differences (chlorpromazine,
doxazosin) between the human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors. since their affinities remained similar in all mutant
receptors, it is likely that the properties of the mutated
binding pockets remained intact, and that the receptor
mutants provided a valid framework for studying the
selectivity of antagonists that discriminate between human
and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors.

mutations in  xxxg2318xxx  and xl2 reciprocally reverse the binding
profiles of human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors for yohimbine,
rauwolscine and rs-79948-197
for the reciprocal mutations in xl2 and  xxxg2318xxx , reciprocal
changes in the binding affinities were seen for the four
ligands, rauwolscine, yohimbine, rs-79948-197 and
wb4101, which preferred the human a2a-adrenoceptor over
the mouse receptor (figure 4). the human double mutant
substituted at positions rxl2.49s and exl2.51k changed the
ligand binding profile so that the ki increased for rauwolscine (fourfold), yohimbine (sixfold) and rs-79948-197
(sevenfold). the reciprocal double mutation (sxl2.49r and
kxl2.51e) in the mouse receptor led to opposite effects on
the binding of these ligands: decreases in the ki for
rauwolscine (o2-fold), yohimbine (fourfold) and rs-79948197 (fourfold). a corresponding reciprocal effect for rauwolscine and yohimbine was seen with substitutions at position
5.43, and the mutation c5.43s in the human receptor led to
an increase in the ki for rauwolscine (eightfold) and
yohimbine (sixfold), whereas the reciprocal s5.43c mutation
in the mouse receptor led to a reduced ki for rauwolscine
(threefold) and yohimbine (sixfold). the mutations at 5.43
did not, however, alter the affinity for rs-79948-197. when

xl2 affects yohimbine binding to a2a-adrenoceptors
jmm laurila et al

1299

mouse a2a-adrenoceptor (s5.43c, sxl2.49r and kxl2.51e),
the largest affinity shifts were observed, with significant
increases seen for yohimbine (16-fold; p ¼ 0.0007), rauwolscine (sixfold; p ¼ 0.0084) and rs-79948-197 (sixfold;
p ¼ 0.026). the affinities were now similar to those of the
human wild-type a2a-adrenoceptor.
of the other ligands, wb4101 preferred the human
a2a-adrenoceptor by about sevenfold over the mouse receptor (apparent ki, 4.5 versus 32 nm; p ¼ 0.0051), with a
tendency for improved affinity at the  xxxg2318xxx  and triple mutant
of the mouse receptor; however, reciprocal effects were not
seen in the human receptor. these results were characterized
by large overlapping confidence intervals, and thus remain
inconclusive. two ligands, arc239 and atipamezole, preferred the mouse ortholog by less than fourfold over the
human ortholog, but none of the mutations significantly
affected the binding affinity of arc239 compared to the
wild-type receptors. for atipamezole, mutations in both xl2
and  xxxg2318xxx  in the mouse receptor significantly decreased its
binding affinity (xl2, threefold;  xxxg2318xxx , sixfold) to resemble
the human receptor, and correspondingly in the human
receptor, the mutation of 5.43 in  xxxg2318xxx  (but not those in xl2)
tended to increase the affinity.
in summary, positions xl2.49 (s/r) and xl2.51 (e/k) in
xl2, and position 5.43 (c/s) in  xxxg2318xxx  are important for
determining the binding preference of yohimbine and
rauwolscine for the human a2a-adrenoceptor versus its
mouse ortholog. in contrast, xl2.49 (s/r) and xl2.51 (e/k),
but not the residue at 5.43, are important for determining
the binding preference of rs-79948-197 for the human
a2a-adrenoceptor. for wb4101 and atipamezole, for which
the initial difference between the mouse and human
receptor affinities was small, no definitive conclusions can
be reached. for arc239 and  xxxd3000xxx , which share rather
poor affinity for the human (and zebrafish, ruuskanen et al.,
2005) a2a-adrenoceptor, the mutations did not explain the
small preference for the mouse receptor observed here.
binding preferences of wild-type human and mouse
a2a-adrenoceptors for endogenous agonists
three endogenous agonists of a2a-adrenoceptors, adrenaline,
noradrenaline and dopamine, were also tested. the agonist
affinities did not differ significantly between the wild-type
mouse and human a2a-adrenoceptors (table 2). in most
cases, the agonist affinity values exhibited greater experimental variability – larger confidence intervals – than those
of the antagonists. the agonist results are more likely to be
affected by the variation in the expression levels of the
receptors, as a high level of expression leads to a predominance of the low-affinity conformation of the receptor, thus
shifting the agonist binding curve to the right. the order of
preference (ki) for the catecholamines was conserved
between the receptor variants: adrenaline onoradrenaline
odopamine.

discussion and conclusions
in the present study, we have investigated the effects of
mutations on ligand selectivity towards the mouse and

human a2a-adrenoceptors. only three positions that are
accessible in the binding cavity are predicted to differ. we
confirmed that position 5.43 in  xxxg2318xxx  affects reciprocally
the binding of two classical a2-adrenoceptor antagonists,
yohimbine and rauwolscine (link et al., 1992; cockcroft
et al., 2000). in addition, we show that two residues in the
xl2 domain of the a2a-adrenoceptors, xl2.49 and xl2.51,
affect the binding affinities of yohimbine and rauwolscine,
contributing to the discrimination between the mouse and
human receptors to the same extent as the residue at 5.43.
the binding of rs-79948-197 was significantly influenced by
the xl2 mutations but not by changes at 5.43.

xl2 and 5.43 may provide anchoring points for antagonists
molecular modelling was used to predict the amino acids
facing the ligand-binding cavity, and identified three
positions that differ within the cavity (figures 2 and 3).
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1293–1304

our results (table 2 and figure 4) suggest that two positions
in xl2, combined with 5.43, contribute to the speciesdependent discrimination by the receptors of some yohimbine-like antagonists. the presence of xl2 as a b-hairpin,
forming the extracellular surface of the binding cavity, is
supported by the proposed disulphide bridge connecting
c3.25 and cxl2.50, which is found in the rhodopsin
structure and is undoubtedly present in these receptors,
too. the disulphide bridge provides an extremely valuable
spatial restraint since the sequence similarity between
rhodopsin and the a2-adrenoceptors is low within the
loop regions. since the mutated positions in xl2 are
located adjacent to cxl2.50, the position of xl2.49 and
xl2.51 relative to the binding cavity should be very well
modelled.
we manually docked yohimbine, rauwolscine, rs-79948-197
and mk-912 into the binding site of the a2a-adrenoceptor model structures built for the human (figure 5) and

human a2a-adrenoceptor. the view is from the plane of the

(d) rs-79948-197 and (e) mk-912 was superposed on the ring from
yohimbine docked to the human a2a-adrenoceptor. mk-912, in
contrast to yohimbine, rauwolscine and rs-79948-197, clashes with
the receptor (especially with w6.48 in tm6) and thus another mode
of binding likely takes place. the three side chains mutated in this
study are shown: cysteine 5.43 (left of the ligand), glutamate xl2.51
(above the ligand, left) and arginine xl2.49 (above the ligand, right).
carbon atoms are shown in green.

mouse receptors. our assumption, based on the experimental results, was that these ligands would be bound in direct
contact with the side chains at 5.43, xl2.49 and xl2.51. in
order to fulfil these requirements, the antagonist ligands
should be placed close to  xxxg2318xxx  (xhaard et al., 2005), where
they fully occupy the agonist-binding pocket. note that our
proposed modes of binding differ from those where the
ligand must be shifted away from  xxxg2318xxx  in order to form a
direct ion-pair interaction between d3.32 and the ligand’s
protonated amine (surgand et al., 2006).
the agonist binding cavity is elongated and oriented
horizontally with respect to the cell membrane. yohimbine,
rauwolscine and rs-79948-197 are also elongated, nearly
planar, ‘l’-shaped molecules formed from four or five ring
systems. both yohimbine and rauwolscine have an aromatic,
hydrophobic end, as well as a polar group (carboxymethyl
and hydroxyl groups) at the opposite end, which in the
models would match well the location of the residues at 5.43
and xl2.49 and xl2.51 (figures 5b and c). in line with this
view, the human a2a-adrenoceptor with a non-polar cysteine
at 5.43 binds yohimbine and rauwolscine with higher
affinity than the mouse/rat receptor having a serine. when
the so2 group of rs-79948-197 is superimposed on the polar

1301

carboxymethyl group of yohimbine and rauwolscine
(figure 5d), the methoxy group at the other end of
rs-79948-197 is located near  xxxg2318xxx  and could form favourable
interactions with either a cysteine or a serine at 5.43;
accordingly, the binding of rs-79948-197 was not affected
by c/s substitutions at 5.43. like the yohimbine analogues,
mk-912 contains a ring system. when mk-912 was docked
onto yohimbine with their aromatic ends similarly placed
closest to  xxxg2318xxx  (figure 5e), clashes with the receptor
structure, especially with w6.48 in tm6, occurred as a result
of the molecules being bent in opposite directions. thus, it is
probable that mk-912 on one hand and yohimbine,
rauwolscine and rs-79948-197 on the other hand adopt
different modes of binding. binding of mk-912 was affected
neither by mutations at 5.43 nor at xl2.49/xl2.51.
we have previously suggested (xhaard et al., 2006) that the
b-hydroxyl group of the adrenoceptor agonists noradrenaline and adrenaline could hydrogen-bond to the amide
backbone of xl2 at xl2.52 and possibly to the functional
groups of long side chains at xl2.49 or xl2.51, too. however,
although long side chains are often found at these positions
in the adrenoceptors, the residue types are generally not
conserved. here, the preference order for the agonists,
adrenaline4noradrenaline4dopamine, was conserved, and
the introduced mutations did not significantly influence the
binding of adrenaline and noradrenaline relative to dopamine. this result is consistent with the proposal that the
b-hydroxyl of adrenaline and noradrenaline interacts with
the amide backbone of xl2, possibly from xl2.52, rather
than with the side chains of xl2.49 or xl2.51.

relative contributions of xl2 and 5.43 to the binding affinity
of a2a-adrenoceptors for yohimbine in different species
yohimbine binds with relatively low affinity to guinea-pig
and bovine a2a-adrenoceptors that have pharmacological
profiles similar to mouse and rat a2a-adrenoceptors, while
chicken, zebrafish, rabbit and pig a2a-adrenoceptors have
profiles more similar to the human receptor ortholog
(bylund et al., 1988; o’rourke et al., 1994; svensson et al.,
1996; uhlén et al., 1998; bylund, 2005). the binding cavity
of the a2a-adrenoceptor was modelled for each of these
species (figure 6). in seven out of the eight animal species,
the presence of a cysteine or serine at position 5.43
correlated well with the receptor’s affinity for yohimbine,
that is, serine is linked to the lower affinity binding (except
in chicken), whereas cysteine is present in receptors that
bind yohimbine with higher affinity. indeed, the pharmacological profiles of four species, human, rabbit, cow and
guinea-pig, which are otherwise identical at xl2.49 and
xl2.51, are segregated according to the residue present at
position 5.43, that is, cow and guinea-pig have here a serine
and mouse-like pharmacology, while human and rabbit have
a cysteine and human-like pharmacology (svensson et al.,
1996; uhlén et al., 1998). therefore, the amino acid at
position 5.43 alone is a major determinant of the binding
profile for these species, consistent with the findings of this
study. the chicken receptor is an exception to this pattern,
suggesting that also other regions of the binding site may
have significant effects on ligand binding (bylund, 2005).

xl2 affects yohimbine binding to a2a-adrenoceptors
jmm laurila et al

figure 6 schematic comparison of the binding cavities of
a2a-adrenoceptors from (a) pig, (b) cow, (c) rabbit, (d) guinea-pig,
(e) zebrafish and (f) chicken. the codes used for comparison to
the human receptor are as in figure 2, but amino-acid deletions
are shown as triangles. the receptors of species with ‘mouse-like’
pharmacology are boxed – with lower affinity for yohimbine.

this study provides the first evidence that substitutions at
positions xl2.49 and xl2.51 influence the pharmacological
profiles of human and mouse a2a-adrenoceptors for yohimbine, rauwolscine and rs-79948-179, showing that these
positions have an effect on their own. indeed, the triple
mutant with substitutions at xl2.49, xl2.51 and 5.43
produces a fully reversed pharmacological profile for yohimbine binding, showing that the effect of xl2.49/xl2.51
is additive to that of 5.43. for yohimbine, rauwolscine and
rs-79948-197, the observed differences for mutants at xl2.49
and xl2.51 were two- to sevenfold with respect to the wildtype receptors, that is, in the same order as was observed for
mutants at 5.43 (0- to 8-fold). thus, the impact of residues
from the xl2 domain on species selectivity for these
yohimbine analogues appears to be equivalent to that of
5.43. since amino acids at xl2.49 and xl2.51 are identical
among human, rabbit, cow and guinea-pig a2a-adrenoceptors, these two positions would not explain any differences
between these species in the binding of a ligand, but this
does not mean that they do not mediate important
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1293–1304

interactions with ligands. indeed, for other species comparisons, for example, human versus mouse, differences at these
positions reveal their importance for ligand binding.
curiously, the chicken a2a-adrenoceptor, with a serine
at position 5.43 as in the mouse receptor, has a pharmacological profile closer to that of the human a2a-adrenoceptor
(bylund et al., 1988; blaxall et al., 1993). the a2a-adrenoceptors of mouse and chicken differ at several positions
within xl2, for example, one amino acid downstream of
xl2.49 is deleted in the chicken receptor, and glycine is
found at xl2.49 in the chicken receptor whereas serine
is present in the mouse receptor. this suggests that xl2
also contributes to the binding preferences of the chicken
a2a-adrenoceptor. in addition to xl2, for several
species, amino acids facing the binding cavity in the tm
regions also differ (figure 6). for example, chicken
and zebrafish a2a-adrenoceptors have isoleucine at position
5.39 (valine in human and mouse), the rabbit receptor has
methionine at position 3.33 (valine) and guinea-pig and
zebrafish receptors have valine at position 1.39 (alanine).
these differences may contribute to some extent
to the binding profiles of the receptors towards different
ligands.
the present study provides further evidence that antagonist affinities at monoamine gpcrs may be significantly
influenced by interactions with xl2. in the a1-adrenoceptor
subtypes a and b, amino-acid substitutions in xl2 at xl2.51,
xl2.52 and xl2.53 have altered the subtype-selectivity of
 xxxd2914xxx  and wb4101 (zhao et al., 1996). positions
xl2.52 and xl2.53 are conserved between the human and
mouse a2a-adrenoceptors, and therefore cannot contribute
to the species preferences observed here. for another
monoamine gpcr, the type-1d serotonin receptor, an
8-amino-acid replacement in xl2, positions xl2.44 to xl2.51,
affected the binding of  xxxd2419xxx  (wurch et al., 1998). xl2
also has a role in antagonist binding to the d1 and d2
dopamine receptors (lan et al., 2006). in conclusion, this
is the first study to show that xl2 has a direct role in
the binding of some a2a-adrenoceptor ligands, that is,
yohimbine, rauwolscine and rs-79948-197.
