hypermethylation of cpg islands is associated with the silencing of
various tumor suppressor genes.  xxxg1932xxx  (rarbeta), cellular  xxxg1938xxx  ( xxxg1938xxx ), and tazaroteneinduced gene 1 (tig1) have been linked to  xxxd3417xxx  signaling.
little is known about the involvement of these three genes in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc). in this study, we
investigated the methylation status of these genes and analyzed
the role of methylation of their dna in escc. methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to study
the methylation of cpg islands in 28 escc (stages i, ii, and iii) and
10 samples of corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa. the mrna
expression levels of the three genes were measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr. dna hypermethylation
of  xxxg1932xxx  was found in seven (25.0%) of the 28 escc, of  xxxg1938xxx 
in five (17.9%), and of tig1 in five (17.9%). dna methylation of
 xxxg1932xxx  was identified in one of 10 samples of corresponding
non-neoplastic mucosa (10.0%), whereas no dna methylation of
 xxxg1938xxx  or tig1 was detected. in total, at least one of the three
genes was hypermethylated in 12 (42.9%) escc. reduced
expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 was found in 14
(50.0%), 15 (53.6%), and 13 (46.4%) escc, respectively. dna
methylation of each gene was significantly associated with
reduced expression of the respective mrna. no correlation was
found between the dna methylation status of  xxxg1932xxx  and
clinicopathological factors such as depth of invasion, lymph node
metastasis, or tumor stage. in contrast, dna methylation of both
 xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 was observed only in stage iii escc. these results
show that inactivation of the  xxxd3417xxx  signaling-associated
genes  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 by dna methylation occurs
frequently in escc. (cancer sci 2005; 96: 571–577)

sophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) is one of the
most common cancers worldwide, but the prognosis for
patients with this condition is extremely poor because of
difficulties with early diagnosis and a lack of effective
treatments.(1) the development of escc is a multi-step and
progressive process, an early indicator of which is the increased
proliferation of epithelial cells, including basal cell hyperplasia and dysplasia, which are regarded as precancerous

lesions. multiple genetic alterations are involved, including
amplification /overexpression of the  xxxg681xxx 
(egf )/egf receptor (egfr)(2,3) and  xxxg366xxx / xxxg789xxx /int-2
genes,(4) abnormal retention of intron 9 in the cd44 gene,(5) loss
of heterozygosity (loh) at multiple chromosomal loci, (6,7)
microsatellite instability,(8) and mutation of the tp53 gene.(9)
in addition to genetic alterations, epigenetic alterations, such
as hypermethylation of cpg islands, are commonly observed
in human cancers. hypermethylation of cpg islands is associated
with the silencing of several tumor-related genes, and has
been proposed as an alternative way to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in cancer.(10,11) the expression of some tumor
suppressor genes, such as  xxxg421xxx ,  xxxg797xxx , cdh1, ecrg4,
mgmt, and  xxxg1341xxx (12–17) is commonly downregulated by cpg
island hypermethylation in escc. however, despite recent
advances in dna methylation studies of esophageal adenocarcinoma,(18,19) gastric cancer,(20,21) and colorectal cancer,(22,23)
the extent of dna methylation in escc is poorly understood.
several lines of evidence suggest that retinoids suppress
carcinogenesis and prevent the development of cancer. retinoids regulate the growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of
normal cells during embryonic development, and of premalignant and malignant cells during carcinogenesis. the
effects of retinoids are mediated predominantly by retinoic
acid receptors ( xxxg1931xxx , -beta, and -gamma), which act as
 xxxd3417xxx -dependent transcriptional activators in their
heterodimeric forms with retinoid x receptors (rxr-alpha,
-beta, and -gamma).(24,25) among rar and rxr,  xxxg1932xxx  is
thought to function as a tumor suppressor. previous studies
have shown that overexpression of  xxxg1932xxx  induces growth
arrest and apoptosis in several cancer cells.(26,27) in addition,
the  xxxg1932xxx  gene is hypermethylated in cancers of the
stomach,(27) breast,(28) lung,(29) and head and neck.(30) although
diminished expression of  xxxg1932xxx  in escc has been
reported,(31) the dna methylation status of  xxxg1932xxx  in
escc is unclear.

another key component of retinoid signaling is cellular
 xxxg1938xxx  ( xxxg1938xxx ).  xxxd3417xxx  is present
in the circulation, but most tissues rely on the uptake and
cytosolic metabolism of  xxxd3417xxx  to activate rar and
rxr.  xxxg1938xxx  possesses high-affinity binding for  xxxd3417xxx ,
possibly functioning as a chaperone-like protein to regulate this
prenuclear phase of  xxxd3417xxx  signaling.(32) the  xxxg1938xxx 
gene is known to be hypermethylated in various human cancers.(33)
however, there are no reports on the role of  xxxg1938xxx  in escc.
 xxxd3297xxx -induced gene 1 (tig1) is one of the genes induced
by  xxxd3297xxx , a synthetic retinoid that binds  xxxg1932xxx  and
 xxxg1933xxx .(34) tig1 may function as a cell adhesion protein,
and its expression on the cell surface may lead to increased
cell–cell contact and reduced proliferation.(35) the tig1 gene is
also known to be hypermethylated in various human cancers.(36,37)
however, little is known about the role of tig1 in escc.
in the present study, we examined the methylation status of
the  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 genes, and the expression
levels of these genes in 28 primary escc samples, as well as
in samples of corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa. to
determine whether hypermethylation causes transcriptional
inactivation, we compared the methylation status with the
mrna expression levels of these genes. we also studied the
relationship between the  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 genes
with respect to methylation status.

materials and methods
tissue samples
twenty-eight escc tissue specimens from 28 patients were
analyzed for methylation of the  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1
genes. ten samples of corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa
were also analyzed. total rna was available for the 28 pairs of
cancer tissues and corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa to
study expression of these genes. cancers and corresponding
non-neoplastic samples were surgically removed, immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°c until use. we
confirmed microscopically that the tumor specimens consisted
mainly (> 50%) of cancer tissue and that the non-neoplastic
samples did not exhibit any tumor cell invasion or significant
inflammatory involvement. tumors were evaluated according to
the tnm staging system.(38) because written informed consent
was not obtained, for strict privacy protection, identifying
information for all samples was removed before analysis; the
procedure was in accordance with the japanese government’s
ethical guidelines for human genome/gene research.
genomic dna extraction and methylation analysis
to examine the dna methylation patterns of the  xxxg1932xxx ,
 xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 genes, we extracted genomic dna with a
genomic dna purification kit (promega, madison, wi,
usa) and performed methylation-specific pcr (msp).(39) in
brief, 2 µg of genomic dna was denatured by treatment with
2 m naoh and modified with 3 m sodium bisulfite for 16 h.
dna samples were purified with wizard dna purification
resin (promega), treated with 3 m naoh, precipitated with
ethanol, and resuspended in 25 µl water. two-microliter
aliquots were used as templates for pcr reactions. the
sequences of primers and the annealing temperature for rarbeta,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 msp were as described previously

(table 1).(33,36,40) we determined the number of pcr cycles
according to the correlation between the mrna expression
and dna methylation of each gene in gastric cancer cell
lines.(41) hot-start pcr with a total cycle number of 30 was
used in all msp dna amplifications.
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr analysis
total rna was extracted with an rneasy mini kit (qiagen,
valencia, ca, usa), and 1 µg of total rna was converted to
cdna with a first strand cdna synthesis kit (amersham
biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa). pcr was performed with
a sybr green pcr core reagent kit (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca, usa). real-time detection of the emission
intensity of sybr green bound to double-stranded dna was
performed with an abi prism 7700 sequence detection
system (applied biosystems), as described previously.(42)
primer sequences are listed in table 1. we calculated the
ratio of target gene mrna expression levels between escc
tissue (t) and corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa (n). we
considered t/n < 0.5 to represent reduced expression. actbspecific pcr products were amplified from the same rna
samples and served as internal controls.

 xxxg1932xxx  gene was detected in samples 1t and 3t. a methylated allele of the  xxxg1938xxx  gene was detected in samples 1t, 2t, and 4t. a
methylated allele of the tig1 gene was detected in sample 2t. in corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, a methylated allele of the rarbeta gene was detected in sample 4n. methylated alleles of  xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 were not detected.

statistical methods
statistical analysis was performed by using fisher’s exact
test. p-values of less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically
significant.

frequencies of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 methylation in
escc and corresponding non-neoplastic esophageal
mucosa
representative msp results for the  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and
tig1 genes in escc tissues and corresponding non-neoplastic
samples are shown in figure 1. among the 28 escc, dna
hypermethylation was detected in seven (25.0%) for rarbeta, five (17.9%) for  xxxg1938xxx , and five (17.9%) for tig1.
the overall results are shown in figure 2. concordant
hypermethylation of  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1938xxx  was found in only
one escc sample, and concordant hypermethylation of
 xxxg1932xxx  and tig1 was found in only one escc sample.
there was a tendency toward concordant methylation of
 xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 (p = 0.0269, fisher’s exact test; table 2).
among the 28 escc, at least one of the three genes was
hypermethylated in 12 (42.9%). we analyzed the relationship
between the methylation status of each gene and the
clinicopathological factors. there was no correlation between
the dna methylation of  xxxg1932xxx  and clinicopathological
data (table 3). however, dna methylation of both  xxxg1938xxx 
and tig1 was detected only in escc of advanced t grade,
n grade, and tumor stage (tables 4,5). the frequency of
dna methylation of  xxxg1938xxx  was significantly higher in stage
iii escc (five of 10, 50.0%) than in stage i/ii escc (0 of
18, p = 0.0026, fisher’s exact test). the frequency of dna
methylation of tig1 was also significantly higher in stage iii
escc (five of 10, 50.0%) than in stage i/ii escc (0 of 18,
p = 0.0026, fisher’s exact test).
in samples of corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, dna
methylation of  xxxg1932xxx  was detected in one (10.0%) of 10
samples. on the other hand, the corresponding tumor sample

(case no. 4) did not show  xxxg1932xxx  methylation. thus, the
origin of this tumor may not be non-neoplastic mucosa with
dna methylation of  xxxg1932xxx . it is possible that tumor cells
may be heterogeneous with regard to aberrant methylation,
resulting in a lack of dna methylation. dna methylation of
 xxxg1938xxx  or tig1 was not detected (fig. 1).
mrna expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 in escc
we used quantitative reverse transcription (rt)–pcr analysis
to determine whether dna methylation of the  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx ,
574

and tig1 genes affects the expression of the their respective
mrna. overall results are shown in figure 2. reduced
expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx , and tig1 was found in 14
(50.0%), 15 (53.6%), and 13 (46.4%) of the 28 escc,
respectively. among the 14 escc with reduced expression of
 xxxg1932xxx , seven (50.0%) had dna methylation of rarbeta, whereas of the 14 escc without reduced expression of
 xxxg1932xxx , no  xxxg1932xxx  methylation was detected (p = 0.0058,
fisher’s exact test; table 3). reduced expression of  xxxg1938xxx 
and of tig1 mrnas was also associated with hypermethylation

of respective genes (p = 0.0437 for  xxxg1938xxx , p = 0.0131 for
tig1, fisher’s exact test; tables 4 and 5). among the 14
escc with reduced expression of  xxxg1932xxx , 12 (85.7%)
were positive for lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0461,
fisher’s exact test). there was no statistically significant
association between clinicopathological factors and mrna
expression of  xxxg1938xxx  or tig1.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the dna methylation and mrna
expression status of three genes associated with retinoid
signaling. dna methylation of these genes was significantly
associated with reduced gene expression, suggesting that
dna methylation plays an important role in transcriptional
inactivation of these genes in escc. it is important to note
that several samples showed reduced mrna expression in
the absence of dna methylation. alternative gene-inactivating
mechanisms, such as hemizygous deletion or alteration of
transcription factors, may account for the reduced gene
expression in these samples. the  xxxg1932xxx  gene is located on
chromosome 3p24, the  xxxg1938xxx  gene is located on chromosome
3q23, and the tig1 gene is located on chromosome 3q25.
loh in chromosomes 3p and 3q has been reported in 35%
and 30% of escc, respectively.(7) previously, lack of
correlation between expression of  xxxg1932xxx  and loh on
3p24 in escc has been reported,(31) thus only loh on 3p24
does not cause the reduced gene expression of  xxxg1932xxx . in
the present study, because the mrna expression levels of the
 xxxg1932xxx  gene in tumor tissues were correlated with dna
methylation, it is possible that the  xxxg1932xxx  gene may have
monoallelic methylation in non-neoplastic tissue and biallelic
methylation or monoallelic methylation plus loh in tumors.
high-level gains at 3q25–29 have been reported in escc by
comparative genomic hybridization.(43)
reduced expression of  xxxg1932xxx  was detected in 50.0% of
escc, and half of these cases showed dna methylation of
 xxxg1932xxx . although dna methylation of  xxxg1932xxx  was
detected in the corresponding non-neoplastic samples
(10.0%), the frequency of methylation in escc (25.0%) was
higher, suggesting that methylation of the  xxxg1932xxx  gene
may contribute to esophageal carcinogenesis. dna methylamizuiri et al.

tion occurs in premalignant and histologically normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus.(19,44) the frequency of
 xxxg1932xxx  methylation did not differ significantly between
early-stage and late-stage escc in this study. however,
among the 14 escc with reduced expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,
12 (85.7%) were positive for lymph nodes metastasis. a previous study indicated that  xxxd3417xxx  induces the expression of  xxxg1568xxx -h1,(45) which is known to reduce cell
motility.(46,47) reduced expression of  xxxg1932xxx  followed by
reduced expression of  xxxg1568xxx -h1 may occur frequently in
escc with lymph node metastasis.
dna methylation of  xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 was detected only
in late-stage escc, and no methylation was detected in corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, indicating that dna
methylation of these two genes may contribute not to carcinogenesis but to tumor progression. however, reduced
expression of both  xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 was not associated with
tumor stage. therefore, the correlation between dna methylation of these two genes and tumor stage may be a secondary effect of global changes in chromatin structure. in breast
cancer, it has been reported that global dna hypomethylation occurs during tumor progression.(48) nevertheless, dna
methylation of both  xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 may be a marker of
tumor progression.
although concordant hypermethylation of  xxxg1932xxx  and
 xxxg1938xxx (33) and of  xxxg1932xxx  and tig1(36) has been reported,
there was no such tendency in escc in our study. approximately half of the escc in our study had methylated dna
for at least one of the three genes, indicating that alterations
of  xxxd3417xxx  signaling are widely involved in escc and
that inactivation of  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1938xxx  as well as of tig1
may not occur synergistically, but rather are random events.
in contrast, concordant hypermethylation of  xxxg1938xxx  and
tig1 was observed. because both  xxxg1938xxx  and tig1 genes
are located on chromosome 3q, it is possible that global dna
methylation effected this change.
in conclusion, our results show that inactivation of the
 xxxd3417xxx  signaling-associated genes  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1938xxx ,
and tig1 due to dna methylation occurs frequently in
escc. because methylated dna can be induced by demethylating agents,(37) these three genes may be good molecular
targets for effective therapeutic strategies for escc.
