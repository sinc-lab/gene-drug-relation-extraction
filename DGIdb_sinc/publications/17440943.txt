background. the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr) is required for actions of  xxxd2019xxx . the
binding of  xxxd408xxx  to the vdr on prostatic epithelial cells prompts the
regulation of cancer-related genes.
methods. we conducted a nested case-control study in the health professionals follow-up
study to investigate the role of the vdr  xxxg425xxx , fok1, and bsm1 gene polymorphisms and
associated haplotypes and their interaction with plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites in relation to
prostate cancer (pc) risk.
results. no association was found between these snps or their associated haplotypes and
all pc subtypes except that haplotype 2 (a-f-b) with  xxxg425xxx  a, fok1 f, and bsm1 b alleles and
haplotype 3 (a-f-b) with  xxxg425xxx  a, fok1 f and bsm1 b alleles compared to the most common
haplotype (a-f-b), were associated with reduced risk of aggressive pc (high stage or gleason
sum 7; p ¼ 0.02), both with two alleles suspected of being low risk. carriers of the variant  xxxg425xxx 
a allele who were deficient in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d (15 ng/ml) compared to noncarriers with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin d, had a lower risk of total and poorly differentiated
pcs (gleason sum 7) (p for interaction ¼ 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d deficiency (26 pg/ml) was associated with a threefold risk of poorly
differentiated pc (p for interaction ¼ 0.01) when comparing carriers of the  xxxg425xxx  a allele to noncarriers with normal  xxxd408xxx .

introduction
studies have linked ultraviolet (uv) exposure,
 xxxd2019xxx , and the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr) to
prostate cancer risk [1–21]. the first study of the
association of  xxxd2019xxx  and prostate cancer was based
on the observation that men living in u.s. states with
higher levels of uv radiation had lower prostate cancer
mortality rates [2]. the discovery that prostate cells
contain the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin d
to  xxxd408xxx  has stimulated additional
studies of how latitude, sun exposure and higher levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin d may be linked to prostate
cancer risk [22]. however, while two nested casecontrol studies showed statistically significant inverse
associations between higher serum levels of 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d [3] or 25-hydroxyvitamin d [4]
and prostate cancer risk, another nested case-control
study showed a u-shaped relationship [23], while other
studies [24] including the health professionals followup study (hpfs) [25] have not found any clear
association.
 xxxd408xxx  exerts its endocrine and
autocrine/paracrine local effects upon binding to and
activating its intracellular receptor vdr, which is
found in many types of tissues, including the prostate
[26]. vdr is a ligand-dependent transcription factor,
because once activated, it can bind to dna and
function as a transcription factor by modulating gene
expression [27,28]. upon exposure to  xxxd408xxx  in vitro, prostate cancer cells that possess
vdr are induced to differentiate and are inhibited from
proliferation [29].
the vdr gene is on chromosome 12 cen-q12-14 and
is approximately 75 kb long [30]. it contains eight
protein-coding exons 2–9, six untranslated non-coding
exons 1a–1f, and several promoter regions [31,32]. the
vdr gene has a thymine to cytosine (t ! c) single
nucleotide polymorphism (snp) at the fok1 restriction
site in the first of two potential start (atg) codons
located in the 50 region, resulting in a vdr protein that
is shorter by three amino acids [8]. the f allele lacks the
first atg; thus, translation starts at the second atg,
instead of the first atg, where translation of the f allele
starts [33]. most data indicate that the f allele is more
effective than the f allele in transactivation of the 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d signal [34]. however, the vdr f
the prostate doi 10.1002/pros

allele has been linked to an increased risk of developing
rickets among nigerian children [35]. the variants in
the 30 region do not alter the amino acid sequence of the
vdr protein or its binding capability [31,33]. we chose
to only study bsm1 snp in the 30 region because it is in
linkage disequilibrium (ld) with apa1 snp located in
intron 8 [36] and with the 30 untranslated region taq1
snp and the poly-a microsatellite, both of which are
suspected of being linked to prostate cancer risk [5,6].
finally, an a ! g substitution in the cis element of the
promoter has been reported, and a lower transcriptional activity is attributed to the g allele because of its
decreased ability to bind with caudal-related homeodomain transcription factor cdx-2 [15].
significant associations, all in the same direction,
were found for the relationship between the six most
studied vdr polymorphic sites (fok1, bsm1, apa1,
taq1,  xxxd81xxx ,  xxxg425xxx , and gata3) and total prostate
cancer risks, in three studies among whites [11,17,37]
and in four studies among non-whites [9,10,12,38] with
f at the fok1, b at the bsm1, a at the apa1, t at the taq1, l
at the  xxxd81xxx , g at the  xxxg425xxx  and a at the gata3
restriction sites as the expected higher risk alleles; nonsignificant associations were found in three studies
among whites [21,27,39] and in two studies among nonwhites [40,41]; no evidence of a genotype effect was
found in one published abstract [42] and in eight
published studies [7,13–15,37,40,43,44] among whites
and in three studies [14,43,45] among non-whites.
finally, two meta-analyses studied two or more vdr
snps mentioned above and found that these vdr
snps were unlikely to be major determinants of
susceptibility to prostate cancer on a population basis
[46,47]. rukin et al. [20] agree with the results of the
meta-analysis but believe that the effect of the vdr
gene as a candidate susceptibility gene should be
looked according to environmental exposures (e.g., uv
radiation).
although a specific haplotype may exhibit a greater
or lesser specificity than individual snps [48], a few
studies have studied the role of vdr haplotypes
individually [17,19,21] while no study has investigated
the role of vdr haplotypes together with plasma
 xxxd2019xxx  in relation to prostate cancer risk. we used
the health professionals follow up study (hpfs)
cohort to investigate prospectively the association of
vdr snps and haplotypes, and their interaction with

vdr gene polymorphisms and haplotypes and prostate cancer risk
plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites, in relation to risk of
various prostate cancer subtypes among whites.
materials and methods
study design and study population
we conducted a nested case-control study within the
hpfs. the hpfs began in 1986 with 51,529 us male
health professionals. eligible for inclusion in the
present study were all men who were diagnosed with
prostate cancer after returning a blood sample in 1993–
1995 but prior to february 2000. reasons for exclusion
from the baseline cohort and detailed descriptions of
hpfs blood collection procedures have been reported
elsewhere [25]. cases were excluded if they were
diagnosed with any other cancer except non-melanoma
skin cancer prior to the date of blood draw. additionally, indolent microscopic focal tumors (t1a) found
incidentally during transurethral resection of the
prostate (turp) were excluded in order to minimize
detection bias and because of their low biologic
potential. cases were ascertained by the participant
(or next of kin for decedents) reporting his diagnosis of
prostate cancer or from death certificates if cause of
death was prostate cancer. the study investigators,
upon receiving permission, successfully obtained
medical and pathology records for 90% of the cases in
the cohort. the remainder of the cases was self reported
with some confirmatory information (e.g., report of
treatment). seven hundred four total prostate cancer
cases, detected mainly by a  xxxg1281xxx 
(psa) test, were diagnosed, between the date of blood
return and january 2000.
controls were eligible for selection if they were still
alive and if they had a psa test following the blood
draw and remained free of prostate cancer at the time of
the case’s diagnosis. one control was matched to one
case on year of birth (1 year) and year of blood return,
history of a psa test before blood draw (yes/no), time
of day at blood draw (midnight to before 9 am, 9 am to
before noon, noon to before 4 pm, 4 pm to before
midnight), and season (winter: january–march,
spring: april–june, summer: july–september and fall:
october–december).
to evaluate whether the  xxxd2019xxx  pathway
influenced the growth and dissemination versus
differentiation stage of the tumor, we classified prostate
cancer by stage using the 1992 version of the american
joint committee on cancer (ajcc) [49] tnm staging
manual and by grade using gleason sum at diagnosis.
‘early stage’ cases were those that were apparently
organ-confined with no involvement of the seminal
vesicle (t1b or t1c or t2a or t2b or t2c or t3a or t3b
and n0m0 stage) whereas ‘advanced stage’ cases were
the prostate doi 10.1002/pros

913

those with local spread to the seminal vesicle and
beyond (t3c or t4 and n0m0, any t and n (1–3), or any
t and m1 stage). tumors with gleason sum <7 were
classified as ‘well to moderately well differentiated,’
while those with a gleason sum 7 were classified as
‘poorly differentiated.’ finally, tumor aggressiveness
was defined based on a combination of stage and
gleason grade: the apparently organ-confined tumors
and gleason sum <7 were defined as ‘less aggressive;’
advanced stage or gleason sum 7 were defined as
‘more aggressive.’
laboratory analyses
blood analyses were done in three batches. the first
batch (1996) included cases diagnosed from 1993
through january 1996 (and their matched controls);
the second batch (1998) included cases diagnosed from
february 1996 through january 1998; and the third
batch (2000) included cases diagnosed from february
1998 through january 2000. the main effect of plasma
 xxxd2019xxx  metabolites on prostate cancer risk was
previously assessed in this cohort, with 65% of the cases
in the present study, using cases diagnosed through
1998 [25].
 xxxd2019xxx  assays. plasma  xxxd2019xxx  levels were
assayed in the laboratory of dr. bruce hollis [50,51].
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d was measured using a
direct radio immunoassay [50]. plasma  xxxd408xxx  was determined using a radioceptor assay
with calf thymus receptors following extraction and
purification of the supernatant of the acetonitriletreated plasma on a nonpolar octadecyl-silanol cartridge [51].
vdr genotyping. one hundred fifty microliters of
pbs was used to dilute 50 ml of buffy coat to extract
dna in a 96-well plate format using the qiamp blood
kit protocol (qiagen, chatsworth, ca). a random
10% of the samples were included in the 96-well plates
as duplicates for quality-control purposes. the results
across the duplicate samples were 100% concordant.
all samples were genotyped blind to case-control
status, using the 50 nuclease assay taqman technology
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) in a 384-well
format [52]. primer and probe sequences for pcr
amplification are available from the authors on request.
initially, 1,408 samples (704 matched case-control
pairs) were selected. fourteen samples (including their
matched pairs) were excluded for the following
reasons: diagnosis of prostate cancer was determined
to be prior to the date of blood draw (n ¼ 6), data were
missing on plasma  xxxd408xxx  (n ¼ 4), or
plasma was insufficient for analysis (n ¼ 4). for the

914

mikhak et al.

overall analyses, 10 more samples were deleted
because either their genotype data or the genotype
data of the case or control they were matched to was
missing on all three snps. eight samples were deleted
from the analyses because they were controls in one
cycle who had become cases in the next cycle and thus
did not have plasma data available. thus, for analyses
with plasma  xxxd2019xxx  as the main exposure, the final
number of samples available was 1,376 while the final
number of matched pairs available was 684. for
analyses with each genotype as the main exposure,
the number of matched pairs was smaller due to
missing genotypes: n ¼ 681 for  xxxg425xxx , n ¼ 649 for fok1,
and n ¼ 619 for bsm1.

statistical analysis
vdr genotypes. we evaluated hardy–weinberg
(hw) equilibrium among controls utilizing a w2 test
[53]. to assess genotype effects, indicator variables
were created for  xxxg425xxx  (ga and aa), fok1 (ff and ff) and
bsm1 (bb and bb) genotypes using gg, ff, and bb
genotypes as references hypothesized to be the high
risk categories, respectively [15,34,35]. conditional
logistic regression models were used to estimate the
odds ratios (or) and their 95% confidence intervals
(cis). to study subtypes of advanced prostate cancer
while maximizing power, we used all the controls in
unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for
the matching factors.
in addition to taking into account the matching
factors, we included in the multivariable models,
known and suspected risk factors for prostate cancer:
first degree cumulative family history of prostate
cancer (yes/no); race (african-american, asian, other
ancestry vs. white); region of residence (west, south,
and midwest vs. northeast); average daily intake of
tomato sauce (two or more servings/week vs. never or
less than two servings/week), calcium (mg/day),
retinol (iu/day),  xxxd2490xxx  (g/day), alcohol (g/
day), energy (kcal/day), fish (servings/week); vitamin
e supplement use (yes/no) and selenium supplement
use (yes/no); body mass index (kg/m2), cigarette
smoking status (current vs. past and never smoker),
low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d (yes/no) and plasma
 xxxd408xxx  (pg/ml). we also estimated
the or of prostate cancer for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency (yes/no) and for plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin deficiency (yes/no). when plasma
25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency was the main exposure, we did not adjust for plasma  xxxd408xxx  because we considered it an intermediate
variable, otherwise, we mutually adjusted for plasma
 xxxd2019xxx  metabolites.

identification and modeling of vdr haplotypes. first, in order to assess d’ which is a measure of ld, we
converted the three vdr genotypes into linkage format
for import into haploview [54]. we observed that the
three snps were not in ld [55]. the haplotype
frequencies were estimated from the genotype data
based on the expectation-substitution algorithm [56–
58] using proc haplotype in sas genetics (version
8.0; sas institute, cary, nc) and haplotypes with a
frequency of less than 4.5% in the total population were
excluded from the analysis. based on the additive
inheritance model, omnibus tests of haplotype association were performed and haplotype-specific ors were
calculated by haplotype replacement regression [56]. in
doing a global test of association, we designated the
most common haplotype (a-f-b) as the reference.
under the additive model, using all the other common
haplotypes as the reference category, haplotypespecific logistic regression coefficients represent the
change in log odds of disease for every additional copy
of the haplotype.
based on the codominant inheritance model, a
model with indicator variables for heterozygotes and
homozygotes of all common haplotypes was compared
to a model with no indicator variable for common
haplotypes. furthermore, individual models with
indicator variables for heterozygotes and homozygotes
of each common haplotype were compared to models
with all the other haplotypes as reference. here, the
haplotype-specific logistic regression coefficients
represent the change in log odds of disease for
heterozygotes or homozygotes of each common haplotype.
plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites. the distributions of
plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites were compared between
the matched case-control pairs using the wilcoxon
signed rank test. a test for trend was conducted with
levels of plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites entered as
single ordinal variables with values of 1–5 corresponding to categories created using the batch-seasonspecific quintile cut points from the controls. the or
and 95% ci from conditional logistic regression models
were estimated with levels of plasma  xxxd2019xxx 
metabolite entered into the models as a series of
indicator variables for quintiles. separate quintile
cutpoints were defined based on the distributions
among the controls specific to each analytical run in
which the assay was done and specific to the season of
the year in which the blood was drawn.  xxxd2019xxx 
metabolite deficiencies were defined as 15 ng/ml for
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d and 26 pg/ml for
plasma  xxxd408xxx , which correspond
to risk of developing osteoporosis, rickets, or
osteomalacia [59]. insufficiencies in plasma vitamin

vdr gene polymorphisms and haplotypes and prostate cancer risk
d metabolites were defined as below the batch and
season-specific median cutpoints captured from the
controls.
evaluation of gene-environment interaction. multivariable models including the dichotomous genotype
(carriers vs. non-carriers) cross-classified with the
dichotomous plasma  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency (low vs.
normal) or the dichotomous plasma  xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency (below vs. above median) were used to obtain
the joint ors. to test the null hypothesis of no
interaction between carriers of the vdr variant allele
and plasma  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency (or insufficiency),
likelihood ratio test (lrt) was conducted by comparing the log likelihood from the model with the main
effect of the dichotomous vdr genotype and the main
effect of the dichotomous plasma  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency
(or insufficiency) to the multivariate model that
included the main effects along with the interaction
term, which was the product of the dichotomous vdr
genotype and the dichotomous plasma  xxxd2019xxx 
deficiency (or insufficiency) variables. finally, lrt
was used to test the departure from a multiplicative
model which included only the main effects of the vdr
haplotypes and plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolite deficiencies.
results
the mean  standard deviation (sd) age at blood
draw for both cases and age-matched controls was
66  7 years. mean time between blood draw and
prostate cancer diagnosis was 3.1  1.7 years. 93.4% of
our study population was white. 8.7% of cases were of
advanced stage and of the 90% cases for whom
information was available on grade, 35.1% were poorly
differentiated, and 38.3% were considered aggressive
(poorly differentiated or advanced stage) prostate
cancer. 8.4% of total cases and 12.7% of controls had
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations below 15
ng/ml, which is the cutoff suggestive of  xxxd2019xxx 
deficiency. 17.2% of total cases and 15.3% of controls
had plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin concentrations
below <26 pg/ml.
vdr genotypes
the control group was in hw equilibrium (p ¼ 0.15,
p ¼ 0.40, and p ¼ 0.64 for  xxxg425xxx , fok1, and bsm1,
respectively). no association was observed between
any vdr genotype and risk of total (table i), aggressive, poorly differentiated, well differentiated and
advanced prostate cancers (tables ib–ie suppl.).
vdrhaplotypes
eight common haplotypes with frequencies 4%
were predicted from genotype data from the three

snps (table ii). under the additive inheritance model,
a statistically significant difference was observed in
vdr haplotype frequencies between aggressive prostate cancer cases and all controls (p ¼ 0.02; table ii) but
not between total or other prostate cancer subtypes and
controls (table ii b–ii e suppl.). compared to the most
common haplotype (a-f-b), haplotype 2 (a-f-b:
or ¼ 0.59, 95% ci: (0.39–0.91), p-trend ¼ 0.19) and
haplotype 3 (a-f-b: or ¼ 0.62, 95% ci: (0.41–0.96),
p-trend ¼ 0.26) were associated with lower susceptibility to aggressive prostate cancer risk (table ii).
under the codominant inheritance model, no difference was observed in vdr haplotype frequencies
between total prostate cancer cases and their matched
controls (p ¼ 0.20; table ii f suppl.).
plasmavitamin d metabolites
no statistically significant differences were seen in
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d and plasma  xxxd408xxx  among total prostate cancer cases and
their matched controls (data not shown). for plasma 25hydroxyvitamin d the median (i.q.r.) in cases was
25.1  12.2 ng/ml and the median (i.q.r.) in controls
was 24.5  12.1 ng/ml (p ¼ 0.22) and for plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d, the median (i.q.r.) in cases was
33.4  10.3 pg/ml and the median (i.q.r.) in controls
was 32.6  9.8 pg/ml (p ¼ 0.36). there was no association of either plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolite with total
prostate cancer (comparing top to bottom quintile, 25hydroxyvitamin d: or ¼ 1.00, 95% ci: 0.79–1.62,
p-trend ¼ 0.88;  xxxd408xxx : or ¼ 0.96,
95% ci: 0.66–1.40, p-trend ¼ 0.59) (data not shown).
however, from the quintile 2 cutoff, a subtle inverse
relationship can be visually detected between plasma
25-hydroxyvitamin d and aggressive and poorly
differentiated prostate cancer subtypes only. the only
significant inverse association was found between
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d and advanced prostate
cancer (comparing quintile 4 to the bottom quintile:
or ¼ 0.39, 95% ci: 0.16–0.96 and compare quintile 5 to
the bottom quintile: or ¼ 0.59, 95% ci: 0.27–1.31,
p-trend ¼ 0.12) (data not shown).
we also examined men who were deficient either in
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d or in plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d compared to men who were
non-deficient. contrary to the hypothesis that low
 xxxd2019xxx  would increase risk, men with clinically
deficient levels of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d had a
38% lower risk of total prostate cancer (or ¼ 0.62, 95%
ci: 0.43–0.91; p ¼ 0.01), a 58% lower risk of poorly
differentiated prostate cancers (or ¼ 0.42, 95% ci:
0.23–0.78; p ¼ 0.01; table iii) and a 49% lower risk of
aggressive prostate cancers (or ¼ 0.51, 95% ci: 0.29–
0.88; p ¼ 0.02; data not shown). similar patterns of risk

of the variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele who were deficient in

reduced risk of total (or ¼ 0.41, 95%ci: 0.21–0.82; pvalue, test for interaction ¼ 0.02, table iv), aggressive

compared to non-carriers with normal levels. conversely, carriers of the variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele who
were deficient in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
d compared to non-carriers with normal levels
were observed to have elevated total (p-value, test
for interaction ¼ 0.07, table iv), aggressive and
the prostate doi 10.1002/pros

poorly differentiated prostate cancer risks (both p
values, test for interaction ¼ 0.01, tables iv b and iv
c suppl. respectively). risk of aggressive (or ¼ 3.1,
95% ci: 1.4–7.2) and poorly differentiated (or ¼ 3.2,
95% ci: 1.4–7.7) prostate cancers were elevated by
threefold for individuals who were deficient in plasma
 xxxd408xxx  and were carriers of the
variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele compared to non-carriers with
normal  xxxd408xxx .
risk of aggressive (or ¼ 0.41, 95% ci: 0.18–0.95, pvalue, test for interaction ¼ 0.04) and poorly differentiated (or ¼ 0.42, 95% ci:0.18–1.00, p-value, test for
interaction ¼ 0.05) prostate cancers were reduced by
about sixty percent for individuals deficient in plasma

vdr gene polymorphisms and haplotypes and prostate cancer risk
 xxxd408xxx  compared to normal, when
comparing carriers of the variant fok1 f allele to noncarriers. there was a suggestion that low plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d is associated with increased risk
of total prostate cancer among individuals with ff
genotype (or ¼ 1.90, 95% ci:1.08–3.36, p-value, test for
interaction ¼ 0.06, table iv). no interaction was noted
between the bsm1 polymorphism and plasma vitamin
d metabolites. furthermore, we investigated whether
the effect of  xxxd2019xxx  treated as continuous is the same
in each category of genotype (carrier of the variant
allele vs. wild-type) but found no statistically significant interaction with respect to any of the prostate
cancer types.
although there was no evidence of an interaction
between the most common vdr haplotypes and
deficiency in plasma  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites in relation
to all prostate cancer subtypes including aggressive
prostate cancer (p-value, global test for interaction ¼ 0.81, data not shown), there was a suggestion
of an interaction between plasma  xxxd408xxx  deficiency and haplotype 2 (a-f-b) with respect
to aggressive prostate cancer risk (p-value, test for
interaction ¼ 0.04, data not shown). with every additional copy of haplotype 2, risk of aggressive prostate
cancer was marginally reduced by 56% (or ¼ 0.44, 95%
ci: 0.19–1.01) when comparing those deficient in
plasma  xxxd408xxx  to those not deficient,
although this was marginally statistically significant
(p ¼ 0.06).
discussion
consistent with two meta-analysis studies [46,47],
and consistent with one study [7] and one published
abstract of a study [42] among the physicians’ health
study cohort, we found that polymorphisms in bsm1
and fok1 are unlikely to be the major determinants of
prostate cancer risk. in contrast to findings by xu et al.
[34] and cicek et al. [21], we did not find that
individuals with the ff (vs. ff or ff) genotype to have
a lower risk of poorly differentiated and advanced
prostate cancers respectively and in contrast to findings
by huang et al. [38], we did not find the vdr ff
genotype (vs. ff or ff) to be associated with an increase
in risk of aggressive prostate cancer. furthermore, in
line with findings from several recent studies [15–
17,60], we observed no association between  xxxg425xxx 
genotype and prostate cancer risk. a significant ld
(d0 ¼ 0.98 in cases) is identified between  xxxg425xxx  and the
gata3 snp which is a g ! a substitution further in
the promoter region upstream of the exon 1a transcription start site [61] suggesting that published associations of risk with  xxxg425xxx  may have resulted from this ld
[17]. finally, no association was found between
the prostate doi 10.1002/pros

919

haplotypes, globally or with individual  xxxg425xxx , fok1,
and bsm1 common haplotypes, and risk of all prostate
cancer subtypes except aggressive prostate cancer. two
common haplotypes (a-f-b and a-f-b) compared to the
most common haplotype (a-f-b), with both haplotypes
carrying two alleles (a, f) or (a, b) suspected of being
the low risk allele, were associated with a lower
susceptibility to aggressive prostate cancer. the inverse
associations we found for aggressive prostate cancer
between the three-locus vdr haplotypes that included
either the f-b or the f-b variants were also observed in a
recent family-based study by cicek et al. [21] that found
inverse associations between the four-locus vdr
haplotypes that also included either the f-b or the f-b
variants and total and advanced prostate cancers.
carriers of the variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele were found to
have a lower risk of total, aggressive and poorly
differentiated prostate cancers if they were low in
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d. furthermore, plasma
 xxxd408xxx  deficiency was associated
with elevated risks of aggressive and poorly differentiated prostate cancers among carriers of the variant
 xxxg425xxx  a allele compared to non-carriers. since we
assessed plasma  xxxd2019xxx  levels instead of uv
exposure status, our findings cannot be directly
compared to findings from bodiwala et al. [15] and
john et al. [16], investigating the association between
vdr snps and prostate cancer risk in sub-populations
with different uv exposures. john et al. [16], found that
the  xxxg425xxx  a allele was associated with a reduction in
advanced prostate cancer risk among men with high
sun exposure. in contrast, bodiwala et al. [15] found
that the  xxxg425xxx  a allele is associated with increased total
prostate cancer risk among men with high sun
exposure. our findings suggest that fok1 snp might
lead to a reduction in aggressive and poorly differentiated prostate cancer risks among individuals
with at least one copy of the fok1 f allele who were
deficient in plasma  xxxd408xxx . furthermore, our findings suggest an increase in risk of
total, aggressive and poorly differentiated cancers
for individuals with ff genotype who were deficient
in plasma  xxxd408xxx  that was only
statistically significant for total prostate cancer. findings from the phs [42] cohort suggest a reduction in
well differentiated prostate cancer risk among individuals with two copies of the fok1 f allele who were
sufficient in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d.
finally, our findings did not confirm ma et al.’s
report that those with the bb (vs. bb) genotype have a
significant reduction in prostate cancer risk in the
presence of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d insufficiency
[7]. possible reasons for differences in findings may
be due to the spectrum of prostate cancer cases
available for analysis (e.g., psa-detected vs. advanced),

variations in the extent of confounder adjustment, the
degree of contributions made by other environmental
factors in modifying the relationship of the vdr
genotype with cancer risk, or chance.
as we had previously observed [25], with the
addition of 232 more case-control pairs, no linear trend
was detected between either of the plasma  xxxd2019xxx 
metabolites and prostate cancer risk except there was a
suggestion of an inverse linear relationship between
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d and advanced prostate
cancer risk. recent studies suggest that prostate cancer
cells tend to lose the ability to convert plasma 25hydroxyvitamin d to  xxxd408xxx 
because of a loss of 1-a hydroxylase activity [62–64];
thus, we speculate one reason why elevated prostate
cancer risk was associated with low plasma 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d among carriers of the  xxxg425xxx  a
allele and not with low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d is
that plasma  xxxd408xxx  levels become
potentially more important in prostate cancer that
cannot efficiently convert 25-hydroxyvitamin d to 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d. another potential explanation
for our findings is that high intake of calcium can
decrease the catabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin d,
which tends to elevate plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d
levels, and can depress plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
d [65]. in addition, milk is a source of  xxxd2019xxx  and
hence increases 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels. if high
calcium or high milk intake are associated with an
increase in prostate cancer risk, then high plasma 25hydroxyvitamin d and low plasma  xxxd408xxx  may reflect a diet high in calcium and milk [65].
interestingly, we found that men with plasma 25hydroxyvitamin d deficiency were at a lower risk
for total and poorly differentiated prostate cancers.
because  xxxd2019xxx  is hypothesized to be protective, a
lower risk in men deficient in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d was unexpected. this finding could be
due to chance but this pattern was observed previously [25] and persisted with our additional followup. we speculate that there are biologic reasons
for this observation.  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency causes
secondary hyperparathyroidism, which stimulates
25-hydroxylvitamin d-1a-hydroxylase production in
the kidneys, and then elevates plasma  xxxd408xxx  [28,66,67]. for example, in a study
comparing asian indians and caucasians living in
the u.s., asian indians had significantly lower serum
levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d and significantly
higher serum levels of  xxxd408xxx  [68].
men who are deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin d but not
deficient in  xxxd408xxx  may represent a
subpopulation that is likely to have a compensatory
increase in plasma  xxxd408xxx  due to
25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency. with more extreme
the prostate doi 10.1002/pros

25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency,  xxxd408xxx  levels drop due to inadequate substrate.
because plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d has a much
longer half-life than plasma  xxxd408xxx ,
a single measure of low 25-hydroxyvitamin d may
better reflect men who are likely to have a compensatory increase in  xxxd408xxx , which
could be protective. thus, if circulating  xxxd408xxx  levels are relevant, men with normal
or high  xxxd408xxx  and low 25-hydroxyvitamin d may be those most likely to have
clinically high  xxxd408xxx . whether
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin d and  xxxd408xxx  are relevant to intraprostatic levels needs
to be determined [69–71].
our study was based on a single measure of plasma
 xxxd2019xxx  levels. the stability of plasma  xxxd2019xxx  over
time has been assessed in this cohort. high pearson
correlation coefficients were found from blood taken
from two time points about 3 years apart: in 1993/94
and again in 1997 [25] for plasma  xxxd408xxx  (r ¼ 0.5) and 25-hydroxyvitamin d (r ¼ 0.7)
measurements. the specific mean intrapair coefficients
of variation (cv%) were <8.2% for  xxxd408xxx  and 25-hydroxyvitamin d in all three batches,
suggesting little within-assay measurement error.
finally, in order to offset the influence of batch-tobatch variability and to prevent potential exposure
misclassification due to within-season variability
between batches, our analyses of plasma  xxxd2019xxx 
were done using the batch-season-specific quintile
cutoffs from the controls.
our findings with respect to genetic associations are
not necessarily generalizable to men other than white
men since the hpfs is a relatively homogenous white
population (1% african americans and 2% asian
americans). our study had sufficient power to address
the hypothesis of interest with respect to the primary
plasma  xxxd2019xxx  hypotheses in relation to total
(n ¼ 684), aggressive (n ¼ 260), poorly differentiated
(n ¼ 238) and well-differentiated (n ¼ 376) prostate
cancers. however, with only 60 advanced cases, we
lacked the statistical power to investigate any but very
strong associations with this potentially relevant endpoint.
in summary, in this cohort of mainly white men,
none of the vdr polymorphisms studied was associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer. two
common haplotypes: (a-f-b) and (a-f-b) compared to
the most common haplotype (a-f-b), were associated
with a reduced risk of aggressive prostate cancer.
carriers of the variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele with low
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d may experience a reduction in risk of total and poorly differentiated prostate
cancers compared to non-carriers with adequate

vdr gene polymorphisms and haplotypes and prostate cancer risk
25-hydroxyvitamin d. in addition, plasma  xxxd408xxx  deficiency compared to normal,
among carriers of the variant  xxxg425xxx  a allele compared
to non-carriers is associated with elevated risk of
aggressive and poorly differentiated prostate cancers.
interestingly, plasma  xxxd408xxx  deficiency compared to normal is associated with a
significant elevated risk of total prostate cancer among
individuals with ff genotype while among carriers of
the variant fok1 f allele compared to non-carriers, it is
associated with reduced risk of aggressive and poorly
differentiated prostate cancers. however, these findings must be replicated in studies with more cases
before any possible role for the fok1 and  xxxg425xxx  snps as
modifiers of the relationship between plasma vitamin
d and prostate cancer risk can be inferred.
