the crystal structure of the p-protein of the glycine cleavage system from thermus thermophilus hb8 has been
determined. this is the first reported crystal structure of
a p-protein, and it reveals that p-proteins do not involve
the a2-type active dimer universally observed in the evolutionarily related pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (plp)-dependent enzymes. instead, novel ab-type dimers associate to
form an a2b2 tetramer, where the a- and b-subunits are
structurally similar and appear to have arisen by gene
duplication and subsequent divergence with a loss of one
active site. the binding of plp to the apoenzyme induces
large open–closed conformational changes, with residues
moving up to 13.5 å. the structure of the complex formed
by the holoenzyme bound to an inhibitor, (aminooxy)acetate, suggests residues that may be responsible for substrate
recognition. the molecular surface around the lipoamidebinding channel shows conservation of positively charged
residues, which are possibly involved in complex formation
with the h-protein. these results provide insights into the
molecular basis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia.

introduction
the glycine cleavage system (gcs) is a multienzyme complex
composed of four different components (p-, h-, t- and lproteins). this system catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of
glycine in a multistep reaction (figure 1) (motokawa et al,
1995). in almost all organisms, the gcs plays a crucial role in
the degradation of glycine, and it has been studied extensively (perham, 2000; douce et al, 2001). in humans, a
mutation in the gcs genes can lead to a dramatic accumula*corresponding author. advanced protein crystallography research

tion of glycine in the blood, resulting in severe neurological
diseases, termed nonketotic hyperglycinemia (nkh) (tada
and kure, 1993; applegarth and toone, 2001). in plants, large
amounts of gcs proteins are present in leaf mitochondria,
where they are involved in the photorespiratory pathway
(douce et al, 2001). in vivo, the gcs acts as a stable complex
with an approximate ratio of 2p:27h:9t:1l; in vitro, it easily
dissociates into its component proteins, and the h-protein
acts as a mobile cosubstrate that commutes between the
other three enzymes (oliver et al, 1990). the three-dimensional structures of h-protein from pea (pares et al, 1994;
cohen-addad et al, 1995; faure et al, 2000) and thermus
thermophilus hb8 (tth) (nakai et al, 2003a), t-protein from
thermotoga maritima (lee et al, 2004), and l-protein from
pea and six other species (faure et al, 2000, and references
therein) have been published, and only the structure of the
p-protein has not yet been reported.
p-protein, also known as  xxxg896xxx  (glycine:
lipoylprotein oxidoreductase (decarboxylating and acceptoraminomethylating),  xxxg896xxx ), is a pyridoxal 50 -phosphate
(plp)-dependent enzyme (plp-enzyme). plp-enzymes have
been classified into fold-types i–v (grishin et al, 1995;
jansonius, 1998; mehta and christen, 2000; schneider et al,
2000), and p-protein belongs to fold-type i based on sequence
similarities (grishin et al, 1995). fold-type i, of which aspartate aminotransferase (ford et al, 1980) is the prototype, is
the best-characterized structurally among the five types. all
of the fold-type i enzyme structures determined so far have
shown that the protein occurs as a homodimer (ai2-type active
dimer) with an internal two-fold axis or as multimers (ai4, ai6
or ai12) (supplementary table i), where each ai-subunit (ai,
b50 kda) contains one molecule of plp. on the other hand,
the subunit compositions of p-proteins from many species
have been classified into two types: those from eukaryotes
(e.g. human (kume et al, 1991) and pea (bourguignon et al,
1988)) and some of the p-proteins from prokaryotes (e.g.
escherichia coli (okamura-ikeda et al, 1993)) are in the
homodimeric form (anc
2 ), while the rest of those from prokaryotes (e.g. clostridium acidiurici (gariboldi and drake,
1984), eubacterium acidaminophilum (freudenberg and
andreesen, 1989) and tth (nakai et al, 2003b) are in the
c
n
c
heterotetrameric form (an
2 b2 ), where the a - and b -subunits
(an and bc, each b50 kda) correspond respectively to the nand c-terminal halves of the b100 kda anc-subunit (anc-n
and anc-c, each b50 kda) based on sequence similarities.
interestingly, while plp is attached not to anc-n and an but
to anc-c and bc (fujiwara et al, 1987), all of these proteins
exhibit sequence similarities to ai. thus, the roles of anc-c
and bc appear to correspond to those of ai, but those of anc-n
and an have remained unknown.
the tth p-protein used in this study has a total molecular
mass of 200 kda (an 47.1 kda with 438 residues and bc
52.7 kda with 474 residues), where an and bc have 31 and

figure 1 the multistep reaction catalyzed by the glycine cleavage
system. first, p-protein catalyzes the decarboxylation of the glycine
molecule concomitantly with the transfer of the residual aminomethyl group to a sulfur atom on the lipoyl group of the oxidized
h-protein (hox), generating the aminomethylated h-protein (ham).
next, the t-protein catalyzes the transfer of a methylene group from
ham to tetrahydrofolate (thf), resulting in the release of nh3 and
the generation of reduced h-protein (hred). finally, the dihydrolipoyl group of hred is oxidized by l-protein and the lipoyl group of
hox is regenerated, thereby completing the catalytic cycle. the
figure is adapted from douce et al (2001).

37% sequence identities with anc-n and anc-c of human
p-protein, respectively. this suggests that tth and human
p-proteins have the same folding topology and similar threedimensional structures. in humans, more than 80% of nkh
patients have a specific defect in p-protein (tada and kure,
1993; toone et al, 2000). therefore, we expected the tth
p-protein structure to be a suitable model for understanding
the molecular basis of nkh. moreover, determination of the
p-protein structure should greatly facilitate studies aimed at
understanding the roles of active-site residues, the reaction
mechanisms and the structural architecture of this multienzyme complex.
here we report the crystal structures of three forms of
tth p-protein: the apoenzyme (papo) at 2.4 å resolution, the
holoenzyme (pholo) at 2.1 å resolution and pholo in complex
with a substrate analog inhibitor (aminooxy)acetate (aoa)
(pholo . aoa) as an external aldimine intermediate model at
2.4 å resolution. these structures reveal a novel anbc-type
active dimer and show that the enzyme undergoes large
conformational changes with movements up to 13.5 å upon
binding of the cofactor. neither of these characteristics have
ever been observed in the other fold-type i enzymes. we
discuss the molecular mechanisms of these enzymes in light
of the new structural information, and in particular how the

results
description of the structure
c
the p-protein has an an
2 b2 -tetrameric structure with an overall size of approximately 114  79  82 å (figure 2), where
two pairs of an and bc form intimate anbc dimers that are
related by a noncrystallographic two-fold axis. thus, the
tetramer can be described as a dimer of heterodimers.
furthermore, an and bc of the anbc dimer exhibit a similar
folding topology (root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of
2.01 å for 395 ca atoms) and thus appear to be related by
an approximate two-fold axis (figure 3a), resulting in the
(anbc)2 tetramer, which mimics a homotetramer with pseudo222 symmetry (figure 2). the designation of the subunits as
an, an0 , bc and bc0 (a prime after a greek letter indicates the
other subunit related by a two-fold axis) has been chosen
such that the an- and bc-subunits (or an0 and bc0 ) form
intimate anbc (or an0 bc0 ) dimers, that is, the active dimeric
form, as shown in figure 2. each subunit in the tetramer
interacts with the other subunits through six interfaces, and
the accessible surface areas buried in the an–an0 , an–bc (an0 –
bc0 ), an–bc0 (an0 –bc) and bc–bc0 interfaces are 1512, 17 222
(17 125), 1433 (1418) and 2199 å2, respectively. notably, the

an–bc interface buries a large hydrophobic surface of
11 058 å2, which would likely render each subunit insoluble
in aqueous solution if an and bc were expressed separately
(nakai et al, 2003b). this may be the reason why coexpression of the two subunits is essential for obtaining functional
recombinant p-protein (nakai et al, 2003b).
the an-subunit is composed of three parts: an n-terminal
arm (n-arm) (residues 1–65), a large a/b domain (residues
79–337) and a small a þ b domain (residues 66–78 and
338–438) (figures 3c and 4). the n-arm, which contains
two a-helices, makes contact with the other three subunits.
the n-arm is connected to the large domain via a loop
belonging to the small domain. the large domain consists
of a central seven-stranded b-sheet (a, g, f, e, d, b and c) plus
nine a-helices, which surround the sheet on both the interior
and surface of the protein, and a small two-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (h and i). the small domain consists of a
four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (a0 , b0, c0 and d0 ) and three
a-helices that make up part of the protein surface. the
bc-subunit is composed of four parts: an n-arm (residues
439–505), a large domain (residues 518–775), a small domain
(residues 506–517 and 776–889) and a c-terminal arm (residues 890–912) (note that the residue numbering starts from
439, as described in the legend to figure 4). the former three
domains correspond to those of an and share common
structural features described above except for a few short

the degree of structural similarity) better than 14.1.
(supplementary table i; the highest z-score for excluded
structures is 7.0). all of these structures belong to fold-type
i, indicating that p-protein should be classified as a member
of fold-type i. however, since all the fold-type i enzymes
other than p-protein occur as an ai2-type active dimer or its
multiple, the anbc-type active dimer observed in the
p-protein is a remarkable exception.
the highest z-scores for an and bc of p-protein were
calculated to be 28.3 and 31.5, respectively, and both were
from comparisons with ai of  xxxg913xxx 
(gludc) from e. coli (capitani et al, 2003), indicating that
gludc is the closest homolog with a known three-dimensional structure. while gludc forms an ai6 hexamer
(figure 2d), unlike p-protein, the overall polypeptide fold
of p-protein is indeed similar to that of gludc (figure 3e);
the superimposition of an and bc onto ai of gludc yields
r.m.s.d.s of 3.8 and 3.0 å, and sequence identities of 12 and
12% for 354 and 369 ca atoms, respectively. the most
notable differences between these structures, other than
subunit compositions, are found at the n-terminal half of
each n-arm (figure 3a and b). the an- and bc-subunits of
p-protein and ai of gludc have an n-arm that crosses over

and embraces the adjacent subunit. in gludc, the n-terminal
half (residues 1–30) of the n-arm mostly participates in
interactions with the neighboring dimer, leading to trimerization of the ai2 dimers; in p-protein, residues 1–39a and 439–
447b participate in interactions with the adjacent subunit,
contributing to dimerization of an and bc. these regions also
participate in interactions with the other dimer (an0 bc0 dimer)
and thus participate in dimerization of anbc dimers.
therefore, p-protein and gludc are similar in that their
n-termini are involved in assembly of active dimers, in
spite of differences in the final assembly of subunits (figure
3a and b).
open–closed conformational changes upon binding
of the cofactor plp
binding of plp to papo induces an open–closed conformational change involving primarily two regions that are adjacent to the active site, with backbone shifts of up to 13.5 å
(figure 5). the first region is a loop that includes an a-helix
(helix 10) from the an large domain (residues 305–322a),
which we will refer to as the ‘mobile loop’. the second region
is composed of a subdomain from the bc large domain
(residues 591–671b), which we will refer to as the ‘mobile

subdomain’. the p-protein ca atoms, except for those of the
mobile loop and mobile subdomain, plus a few other residues
(described later), in the open and closed forms, were superimposed by least-squares fitting, giving an r.m.s.d. of 0.37 å,
with a maximum displacement of 1.15 å for 797 ca atoms
(figure 5b). in contrast to the good agreement of the ca
atoms of these residues, larger differences were observed in
the loop and subdomain ca atoms, which gave r.m.s.d.s of
7.31 and 1.28 å, with maximum displacements of 13.5 å
(ile309a) and 2.5 å (arg636b), respectively.
the mobile loop in papo contains an a-helix (helix 10).
binding of plp induces conformational changes in the loop
involving shortening of helix 10 (from arg306a–arg311a to
gln308a–arg311a) and formation of two 310-helices (helices
z7 and z8; figure 4a). the mobile subdomain consists of
three a-helices (helices 7, 8 and 9) and three b-strands
(strands b, c and d). the motion of the subdomain can be
approximated by a 4.01 rotation as a rigid body to close
the active site, because the subdomain ca atoms of papo are
superimposable onto those of pholo with an r.m.s.d. of
0.30 å and a maximum displacement of 1.13 å for 81 ca
atoms (figure 5b). besides the loop and the subdomain,
four regions (glu33a–pro38a, pro267a–his268a, ala569b–
gly570b and glu739b–glu740b) exhibit prominent conformational changes (figure 5b). the first three regions are located
around the active site and interact with plp directly or
indirectly via other mobile regions (figure 5a). notably, the
peptide bond preceding pro267a undergoes trans–cis isomerization. ala569b–gly570b move up to 4.1 å, allowing their
main-chain nh groups to form hydrogen bonds with the
phosphate group of plp. in contrast, the fourth region
(glu739b–glu740b) lies at a molecular surface distant from
the active site and is involved in crystal packing environments that differ between the papo and pholo forms, resulting
in different conformations in this region.
cofactor binding to proteins often results in conformational changes. another plp-enzyme, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, also shows similar conformational changes
(alexeev et al, 1998), including movement of two regions
corresponding to the mobile loop and subdomain of the pprotein. however, the conformational changes in 8-amino-7oxononanoate synthase involve smaller backbone shifts of up
to 5.3 å (except for the c-terminus) as compared with 13.5 å
in the p-protein. this is likely due to the absence of refolding
of the helices, as observed in the p-protein. the mobile loop
of the p-protein also corresponds to a disordered loop found
in the crystal structure of  xxxg618xxx  (burkhard
et al, 2001). the disordered loop includes highly conserved
residues that are essential for catalytic activity (ishii et al,
1996). bertoldi et al (2002) have reported that one of the loop
residues is responsible for protonation of the decarboxylated
reaction intermediates to form biological amines. it is also
notable that in p-protein, highly conserved residues are
located in the mobile loop (figure 4). these data imply that
the mobile loop may also play a catalytic role in the latter
catalytic steps carried out by the p-protein (supplementary
figure 1c–f).
the active site
the (anbc)2 p-protein tetramer has two active-site pockets at
the an–bc and an0 –bc0 interfaces (figure 2). each pocket is
situated also at the domain interface of bc (figure 3d). the
& 2005 european molecular biology organization

residues constituting the pocket can be considered as two
regions. the first region is the bottom of the active-site
pocket, which consists of residues at one end of the sevenstranded b-sheet from the bc large domain (gly570b,
ala571b, glu574b, his604b, ser606b, thr648b, thr652b,
asp677b, ala679b, asn680b, his699b, asn701b, his703b
and lys704b) (figure 6a). the second region is the top of
the pocket, which consists of residues from the bc small
domain (ser511b and cys512b) and from the an large domain
(tyr95a, thr96a, tyr98a, gln308a, tyr309a, thr320a and
thr321a) (figure 6b). of the 23 residues comprising these
two regions, 20 are strictly conserved (figure 4), suggesting
that structure and function of the active site are essentially
conserved among the p-proteins.
the cofactor plp is bound to the active-site pocket by
extensive noncovalent interactions with all the bottom
residues of the pocket and with some of the top residues
(ser511b, tyr95a, thr320a and thr321a). plp also forms an
internal aldimine bond (schiff base linkage) with the catalytic
residue lys704b (figure 6b and supplementary figure 1a).
the pyridine ring of plp is sandwiched by the methyl group
of ala679b and the imidazole ring of his604b. the pyridine
ring of the cofactor makes an angle of 14.91 with the
imidazole ring of his604b. the phosphate group of plp is
involved in a number of hydrogen bonds and one ion pair,
and acts as an anchor to fix the cofactor to the active site.
the negative charge of the phosphate group is likely to be
balanced by the positive charge of his703b and the dipole of
helix 6 of bc, which is positioned with its n-terminus close to
the phosphate group. in addition, asp677b forms an ion pair
with the protonated nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring of plp,
as in other plp-enzymes, and ser511b forms hydrogen bonds
with the o3 atom of plp.
binding of substrate
the substrate-binding site of the p-protein consists mostly of
the top residues of the active-site pocket (tyr95a, thr96a,
tyr98a, gln308a, tyr309a, thr320a, ser511b, cys512b and
his604b) (figure 6); in the pholo . aoa complex, the aoa
moiety makes van der waals contacts with these residues.
aoa is a substrate analog in which the amino (nh2) group of
glycine is replaced by an aminooxy (onh2) group.
in the substrate-free form, seven water molecules (w1–
w7) in the substrate-binding site are involved in hydrogenbond networks, where w1–w4 together with the oh group of
tyr95a form a linear hydrogen-bond network (figure 6b).
this network is connected to the phosphate group of plp
through w1 and to the side-chain c¼o of gln308a and the
main-chain nh of gly605b through w4.
upon binding of aoa, two water molecules (w1 and w2)
are liberated from the substrate-binding site and the cofactor
makes a new covalent bond with aoa in place of lys704b
(figure 6c and supplementary figure 1a and b). this may
be an aldimine bond, based on the good agreement between
the substrate model and electron density (figure 6c). in this
case, this bond corresponds to the external aldimine shown
in supplementary figure 1b. the released e-amino group of
lys704b makes an ion pair with the phosphate group of plp.
while a new hydrogen-bond network is formed between aoa
and the surrounding residues, the active-site residues, except
for lys704b, do not change their positions, and the interactions among them are retained upon aoa binding; the

corresponding active-site residues of pholo and pholo . aoa
were superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 0.15 å and with a
maximum displacement of 0.55 å (figure 6d).
the carboxylate of aoa occupies the space formed by the
liberated water molecules. one of the carboxylate oxygen
atoms of aoa forms hydrogen bonds with the oh group of
tyr95a and with the oh group of thr96a through w6, and
the other forms hydrogen bonds with the oh group of
tyr98a, with the nh2 group of gln308a and with w3. w3
is also involved in the hydrogen-bond network described
above. the n1 atom of aoa forms a hydrogen bond with
the imidazole ne2 atom of his604b. the pyridine ring of the
cofactor and the imidazole ring of his604b rotate by 18.3 and
6.31 toward the solvent side, respectively, compared with
their positions in the free enzyme (figure 6d).
aoa is fixed at the substrate-binding site by extensive
interactions with the active-site residues. the aoa and
glycine structures are nearly identical except for the one
extra oxygen atom proximate to the amino group, which
suggests that the binding mode of aoa is similar to that of
glycine but is not strictly identical, due to displacement (up to
b1.5 å) of the distal carboxylate. nevertheless, the pocket
residues surrounding aoa are likely to be involved in substrate recognition. this is supported by the facts that all
residues involved in the above interactions with aoa are
highly conserved (figure 4) and that the orientation of the
carboxylate is appropriate for decarboxylation. the latter fact
is based on the model for control of the reaction specificity of
plp-enzymes (dunathan, 1966); the scissile bond of the
external aldimine intermediate must be oriented perpendicular to the p system of the cofactor. in the pholo  aoa structure,
the carboxylate of the inhibitor is in an orientation approximately orthogonal to the plane of the cofactor ring (figure 6c
and supplementary figure 1b).

the lipoamide-binding channel and the surface
properties neighboring its entrance
after formation of the external aldimine between plp
and glycine, p-protein catalyzes a second reaction: the decarboxylation and reductive aminomethylation of lipoamide
(supplementary figure 1). the lipoamide is presented to
p-protein in the form of a 16 å long lipoyl-lysine arm of
h-protein (figure 7). molecular recognition and interaction
between h- and p-proteins have been suggested by biochemical experiments, in which h-apoprotein lacking lipoamide
was found to behave as a competitive inhibitor relative to
h-protein in the second reaction (neuburger et al, 2000). the
active site of p-protein is connected to the molecular surface
by an b18 å deep channel with a broad entrance facing the
solvent (figure 7). the channel is lined by residues from both
an and bc (figure 7d), most of which are hydrophobic
residues that could interact with the aliphatic chain of the
lipoyl-lysine. in the model structure (figure 7d), the disulfide
of the lipoamide lies close to the side chains of tyr95a,
tyr98a, gln308a and his604b. while these residues should
be involved in the substrate recognition as described above,
one of the residues may also act as a proton donor in the
reduction of the disulfide bond (supplementary figure 1d).
note that gln308a is located at the mobile loop, and its
counterpart in  xxxg618xxx  is important for catalysis,
as described above.
& 2005 european molecular biology organization

the molecular surface neighboring the entrance of the
channel possesses two remarkable properties. as shown in
figure 7b and c, the molecular surface of the p-protein
reveals that conserved residues cluster around the entrance
of channel and that several of them are positively charged
(lys146a, arg280a, arg306a, arg311a, arg312a, lys314a,
lys316a, arg894b and lys902b). in contrast, negatively
charged residues are situated around the lipoyl-lysine arm
of the h-protein, and most of them are highly conserved
(nakai et al, 2003a). the data imply that these residues play a
critical role in the interaction between the p- and h-proteins.

discussion
the structure of p-protein presented here reveals that the
enzyme is present as an (anbc)2 tetramer containing a unique
arrangement of anbc-type active dimers. the molecular mass
of the tetramer is consistent with dynamic light scattering
results in aqueous solution (nakai et al, 2003b), indicating
that the tetramer is the native oligomeric state. p-protein has
been classified as a member of fold-type i plp-enzymes,
based on sequence similarities (grishin et al, 1995), and
this is now confirmed experimentally. all other fold-type i
enzymes with known structures are intimate ai2 dimers, each
with an internal two-fold axis, or loose multiples thereof,
where an ai2-type dimer has two active sites at the ai–ai0
interface. in contrast, two intimate anbc dimers in the pprotein are related by a two-fold axis to form an (anbc)2
tetramer, in which each anbc-type dimer has only one active
site at the an–bc interface. the an- and bc-subunits show
24% sequence identity and have similar structures, and so
the anbc dimer appears to have an approximate two-fold axis
(figure 3a) and to mimic an ai2 dimer such as those seen in
gludc (figure 3b). these data suggest that the anbc-type
active dimer of the p-protein arose by gene duplication of a
homodimeric ancestor, after which the ancestral p-protein
has structurally diverged such that the protein has been
specifically adapted for use as a multienzyme complex component, even though this involved the loss of one active site.
more specifically, in the other fold-type i enzymes including
the presumed homodimeric ancestor, the pocket size of the
active site has remained fixed so that only small substrates
have been recognized (supplementary table i). in the pprotein, the pocket size had to expand to recognize macromolecular substrates such as h-protein, and this may have
required major rebuilding on a molecular scale, involving the
loss of one active site, and thereby leading to an asymmetric
active dimeric form for the enzyme.
in contrast to the tth p-protein, the human p-protein
occurs in a homodimeric form (anc
2 ). our results suggest
that the human p-protein consists of ‘dimer-like active monomers’, each of which corresponds to the anbc-type active
dimer seen in the tth p-protein. figure 8 shows a model
structure of the human p-protein. the structures of anc-n
and anc-c of the human p-protein model are essentially the
same as those of an and bc of the tth p-protein, respectively.
the two halves of the model are connected by a 17-residue
stretch of residues from ser492 to ile508. the corresponding
31-residue linker region in the tth p-protein stretches from
residues 437a to 467b (figure 4). these regions in the human
and tth p-proteins do not exhibit significant sequence identity, and the different lengths of the linker regions indicate

that the structures are locally divergent here. from the viewpoint of molecular evolution, we suggest that a dimer-like
active monomer (anc) has evolved by gene fusion of the two
subunits of the anbc-type active dimer. the two subunits had
arisen by gene duplication and evolutionary divergence,
as described in the previous paragraph. this hypothesis
is supported by the higher sequence identity between

nc
and a -c share b31 and b37% sequence identities with

an and bc, and between anc-n and anc-c, respectively. many

alleles of non-finnish patients. meanwhile, our results support the hypothesis that the human and tth p-proteins share

disease are shown in magenta. the orientation is the same as that in figure 3a. the linker region connecting anc-n and anc-c is represented by
a cyan curve with spheres placed at intervals of 3.8 å (the mean length between two successive ca atoms), while the corresponding region of
tth p-protein is shown in semitransparent gray. the other regions are colored by domain according to figure 3a. in constructing the model, we
started with the tth p-protein backbone, and then added a linker region along the molecular surface, so as to select the shortest distance
between the an c-terminus (leu437a in tth) and one of the residues in the n-terminal region of bc or bc0 , assuming that the overall
n c
arrangement of the human anc
2 dimer subunits is similar to that of the tth (a b )2 tetramer. the resulting linker region starts from leu437a and
leads to leu467b, and is composed of 13 residues. our model linker is shorter than the actual linker in the human p-protein, which consists of
17 residues connecting ser492 with ile508. the human p-protein linker thus may contain helical and other regions that are similar to the
corresponding region in the tth p-protein.

tion of the cofactor, substrate and possibly the h-protein, and
show that most of these residues are well conserved among
these p-proteins. hence, the catalytic mechanisms should be
essentially the same for both the tth and human p-proteins.
we will now discuss the possible molecular mechanisms of
the human p-protein, with our arguments based on the tth
p-protein structure, and we will also explore how pathogenic
mutations (figure 8) lead to loss of enzymatic activity. the
tth p-protein residue phe706b (phe756 in the human pprotein; note that the corresponding residue number in the
human p-protein is shown in parentheses) is fully conserved
(figure 4), and is situated close to the active site, where it is
only two residues from the catalytic residue lys704b; thus,
f756del would disrupt the active site. ala221a (ala283) and
ala251a (ala313) lie in the middle of helix 8 and strand f,
respectively, and a283p or a313p would therefore break
these secondary structures. pro267a (pro329) is fully conserved and is involved in the conformational changes upon
binding of plp, suggesting that p329t affects binding of the
cofactor. pro650b (pro700) is a fully conserved residue in the
conserved sequence motif mhtxpxt, where ‘x’ indicates any
amino acid and ‘h’ is a hydrophobic residue. this proline
residue adopts the cis-conformation and lies adjacent to the
active site, and therefore p700a is likely to affect the activesite structure. arg474b (arg515) is a fully conserved residue
located at the an–bc interface. the side chain of arg474b
forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain c¼o groups of
glu119a and leu120a, both of which are situated at the
c-terminus of helix 5. the dipole of this helix is well balanced
with the positive charge of arg474b. hence, r515s would
destabilize the corresponding interface. pro518b (ser564) is
located in tightly packed structure proximate to the con& 2005 european molecular biology organization

served sequence motif plgsctmkhn constituting the active
site, suggesting that s564i affects the active-site structure.
gly711b (gly761) and gly712b (gly762) are fully conserved
residues in the sequence motif phggggpg. both residues lie
in a tightly packed structure at the an–bc interface neighboring the active site. in g761r or g762r, the introduction
of bulky side chains likely hampers the subunit association
at the corresponding interface and disrupts the active site.
therefore, there are compelling structural arguments that
can explain the observed loss of enzymatic p-protein activity
associated with each of these mutations. there is, however,
no structural explanation for the effect of the other two
mutations: a802v is situated at a region where the sequences
of the two proteins are locally divergent, and the residue
altered by the mutation r410 k aligns with lys348a in the
tth p-protein. nevertheless, in most of the cases, the tth
p-protein structure provides a molecular basis for understanding how the nkh mutations lead to loss of enzymatic activity.
in conclusion, the tth p-protein structure greatly aids in
understanding the molecular pathology of nkh in humans.
plausible arguments have been presented for the molecular
basis of point mutations associated with this disease, including three recurrent mutations (applegarth and toone, 2001).
the structural information will be useful in interpreting
other nkh mutations that may be identified in the future.
furthermore, our work on p-protein provides a structural
characterization of the final gcs component with an unknown structure. it gives new insights into the molecular
evolution of p-proteins, provides a structural basis for understanding the architecture and function of this fascinating
complex, and should stimulate further structure/function
studies.

materials and methods
crystallization
the expression of tth p-protein by e. coli, and purification and
crystallization of the expressed protein have been reported elsewhere (nakai et al, 2003b). briefly, the purification was accomplished by heat treatment and four-step column chromatography
using 20 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 8.0). the purified protein was
crystallized by vapor diffusion at 298 k using 30% (w/v)
 xxxd2982xxx  (peg) 3350 and 300 mm kscn as the
precipitant (form i in table i). however, since the crystallization
rate of form i proved to be insufficient for structure determination
by using heavy-atom derivatives, we searched for new crystallization conditions to find a new crystal form more suitable for
structure determination (form ii in table i).
the purification conditions for form ii were essentially the same
as those for form i except that 20 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 8.0) was
replaced with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0). the
purified protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion at 277 k using
22% (w/v) peg 3350, 300 mm li2so4 and 100 mm mes–naoh (ph
6.5) as the precipitant. a droplet containing 2 ml protein solution
(10 mg ml1 protein, 20 mm hepes–naoh (ph 8.0), 200 mm plp
and 1 mm dtt) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir
solution and equilibrated against 400 ml of reservoir solution to give
crystals of form ii. finally, the structures of forms i and ii were
revealed to be papo and pholo, respectively.
crystal soaking and data collection
a crystal of pholo was soaked for 3 h in artificial mother liquor
containing an inhibitor, aoa (26% (w/v) peg 3350, 300 mm
li2so4, 5 mm aoa, 100 mm mes–naoh (ph 6.5)), generating a
crystal of pholo . aoa. a mercury derivative was prepared by soaking
a crystal of pholo in the same liquor containing 1 mm methylmercury
chloride (ch3hgcl) for 3 h. all soaking experiments were
performed at 277 k.
prior to data collection, each crystal of pholo, pholo . aoa and the
mercury derivative was soaked for a few seconds in a cryoprotectant solution containing 18% (w/v) peg 400, 22% (w/v) peg 3350,
300 mm li2so4 and 100 mm mes–naoh (ph 6.5) and then
transferred to a nylon loop and flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas
stream at 90 k. the data collection preparation for papo was the
same as above, except that its cryoprotectant solution contained
35% (w/v) peg 3350 and 300 mm kscn. x-ray diffraction data
were collected at 90 k using synchrotron radiation from bl45xu
(yamamoto et al, 1998) or bl44b2 (adachi et al, 2001) at spring-8
(table i). data processing was completed using the program
hkl2000 (otwinowski and minor, 1997) (table i).
structure determination
the structure of pholo was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (siras) with a ch3hgcl derivative. a total of 11 mercury sites of the derivative were identified and
refined at 3.38 å resolution by the program solve (terwilliger,
2002), which gave an overall figure of merit of 0.32. the solve
phases were subsequently input to the program resolve (terwilliger, 2002) for density modification and automatic model building.
resolve gave an overall figure of merit of 0.48 and built 79% of
the peptide backbone in the asymmetric unit including 62% of the
side chains. the electron density map after density modification
was of good quality, and the remaining model was built manually
into the map using the program xfit within the software package
xtalview (mcree, 1992).

the structure of papo was solved by molecular replacement using
the program amore (navaza, 1994), using the refined coordinates
of pholo as the search model. the model was constructed from the
(anbc)2 tetramer, in which all the plp and water molecules were
removed. a rotational search using data from 15 to 4 å resolution
gave a distinct solution, which was followed by a translational
solution showing an (anbc)2 tetramer in the asymmetric unit with
an rfactor of 34.1%.
structure refinement
the structure of pholo was refined by simulated annealing and
energy minimization with the program cns (brunger et al, 1998).
after several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding, the
difference fourier map clearly exhibited residual electron density
corresponding to the bound plp. the electron density of plp was
connected to the e-amino group of lys704b (figure 6b), indicating
that plp is covalently bound to lys704b via an aldimine bond, like
those observed for other plp-enzymes. water-molecule picking
using the program cns and further model building and refinement
cycles produced the final model (table i). the structure of
pholo . aoa was refined using the same procedure as that used for
pholo. the refined coordinates of pholo, except for the plp and water
molecules, were used as the initial model. when the rwork was
below b25%, the difference fourier map clearly exhibited residual
electron density corresponding to the aoa and plp molecules. the
electron density of aoa was connected to the c40 atom of plp and
the density corresponding to the linkage between plp and lys704b
found in pholo was absent (figure 6c). this result indicates that the
internal aldimine between plp and lys704b is cleaved and a new
external aldimine is formed between plp and aoa. the structure of
papo was refined using the same procedure as pholo, except that the
coordinates obtained by molecular replacement were used as the
initial model. no electron density for plp was observed, showing
that the crystals represented the apo-form of the enzyme.
analysis of the stereochemistry showed that every model was of
good quality, with more than 99.0% of the residues falling in the
allowed regions (table i). eight proline residues of each heterodimer (205a, 267a, 373a, 650b, 715b, 733b, 845b and 887b), except
for pro267a in papo, were found in the cis-conformation.
graphical representations of protein models were generated
by molscript (kraulis, 1991) (figures 2, 3 and 5–8), xfit (mcree,
1992) (figure 6) and grasp (nicholls et al, 1991) (figure 7), and
rendered with raster3d (merritt and bacon, 1997) (figures 2, 3 and
5–8).
