objective: to assess whether hormonal agents used in the medical treatment of endometriosis, such as
 xxxd1806xxx  and gnrh agonist, exert direct regulatory action on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( xxxg357xxx )
expression by endometrial epithelial cells.
design: primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from human endometrium were exposed to different
concentrations of cytokines and steroid hormone analogs. expression of  xxxg357xxx  was analyzed at the levels of
protein and messenger rna.
setting: gynecology clinic and laboratory of endocrinology of reproduction.
patient(s): women presenting for infertility or pelvic pain in whom endometriosis was diagnosed by using
laparoscopy.
intervention(s): endometrial tissue biopsy performed at laparoscopy.
main outcome measure(s): secretion of  xxxg357xxx  protein was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mrna steady-state levels were measured by performing northern blot analysis.
result(s):  xxxd388xxx , a gnrh agonist (0.1–10 ng/ml), had no significant effect on  xxxg357xxx  expression,
whereas  xxxd1806xxx  (10⫺7–10⫺5 m), a testosterone analog, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid hormone (10⫺12–10⫺6 m), showed a direct and a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on  xxxg357xxx  expression. this effect occurred at the level of protein and mrna.
conclusion(s): the findings of the study may affect understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal
treatments act on endometriosis and influence its clinical manifestations. (fertil steril威 2000;74:969 –75.

endometriosis, the proliferation of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is a common
gynecologic disease that causes pelvic pain and
infertility in about 10% of the female population (1). endometriosis is associated with numerous immunologic changes in the eutopic
endometrium of affected women (2); these
include the presence of antibodies to specific
endometrial antigens (3), increased secretion of
interleukin-6 by stromal cells (4), elevated
level of complement component c3 (5), marked
leukocyte infiltration (6), increased expression
of heat-shock protein 27 (7), and augmented
release of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by
endometrial stromal cultures (8). according to
our previous in vitro and in vivo studies, the

endometrial cells of women with endometriosis
abnormally express increased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( xxxg357xxx ) (9, 10).
this factor has the potent ability to chemoattract
and activate monocytes and macrophages (11,
12) and may be involved in the increased recruitment of these cells into the endometrium
of women with endometriosis.
endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disorder that primarily affects women of reproductive age (13). estradiol is believed to be the
hormonal factor that plays a key role in development of the disease (13–15). current medical
therapy for endometriosis is based on suppression of ovarian function (16, 17).  xxxd1806xxx , a

gonadotropins and suppresses gametogenesis and gonadal
steroidogenesis, has been shown to have direct immunosuppressive properties (18, 19). on the other hand,  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonists, which are
known to mainly act by desensitizing the pituitary gonadotropes with resultant reduction in circulating serum gonadotropin levels and inhibition of ovarian function, do not
appear to directly affect immune function (16, 17).

endometrial biopsy specimens were obtained by aspiration with an endometrial suction curette (unimar inc.,
neuilly-en-tchelle, france). they were immediately placed
in sterile hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  containing penicillin,
100 u/ml; streptomycin, 100 ␮g/ml; and 0.25 amphotericin
b, ␮g/ml (gibco brl, burlington, ontario, canada) at
4°c and were transported to the laboratory.

our previous data revealed enhancement of  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells of women with endometriosis
in response to administration of ovarian steroids (personal
communication, annie boucher). these observations indicate a possible direct action of sex steroid on the inflammatory processes that take place in the endometrium. the
objective of the present study was to investigate whether
hormonal agents used in the medical treatment of endometriosis have a direct effect on  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells.

endometrial tissue was minced into small pieces and
incubated with collagenase (sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo) to dissociate epithelial glands from fibroblast-like cells.
the material was further separated by differential sedimentation and adhesion as described elsewhere (9). epithelial
glands were dissociated by using 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mm
ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (edta) (gibco brl) for
10 minutes at 37°c, and 5% co2; they were then cultured in
56-cm2 tissue culture dishes in dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium f12 (gibco brl) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs) (gibco brl); insulin, 10 ␮g/ml
(sigma), transferrin, 5 ␮g/ml (sigma); and 1% antibiotics–
antimycotics (gibco brl). the purity of endometrial epithelial cell cultures has been verified morphologically by
using phase-contrast microscopy and immunocytochemically on parallel coverslip cultures as described elsewhere
(9). no cd-45 positive leukocytes were detected in culture,
and less than 1% contamination by stromal vimentin–positive or endothelial factor viii–positive cells was generally
observed (data not shown).

materials and methods
source and handling of tissue
endometrial biopsy specimens used in this study were
obtained from 13 women with endometriosis (table 1). four
women had stage i disease, 4 had stage ii disease, 3 had
stage iii disease, and 2 had stage iv disease. all women
gave signed informed consent, and the research protocol was
approved by the ethics committee on human research of
hôpital saint-françois d’assise. participants were 23 to 42
years of age, had had consultation for infertility or pelvic
pain (or both), were found to have endometriosis at the time
of laparoscopy, had no endometrial hyperplasia or neoplasia,
and had not received any anti-inflammatory or hormonal
medication in the 3 months before laparoscopy.

culture stimulation and  xxxg357xxx  synthesis
primary epithelial cell cultures grown to confluence were
subcultured (using only one passage) with a split ratio of 1:2
in 56-cm2 petri dishes in roosevelt park memorial institute
(rpmi) medium (gibco brl) containing 10% dextranvol. 74, no. 5, november 2000

coated charcoal-treated fbs; insulin, 10 ␮g/ml; transferrin,
5 ␮g/ml; and 1% antibiotics–antimycotics.
optimization of cell stimulation with interleukin-1␤
to evaluate the effects of hormonal therapeutic agents, we
used interleukin (il)-1␤ (genzyme, cambridge, ma) to
induce  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells. to determine the optimal conditions of stimulation with il-1␤, subcultured endometrial cells were grown to confluence and
incubated overnight in fbs-free medium before being exposed to different concentrations of il-1␤ (0.01–10 ng/ml)
in a fresh fbs-free medium for varying times (0 –24 hours).
assays of the agents
 xxxd1806xxx  (sigma), 10⫺7–10⫺5 m, and gnrh agonist ( xxxd388xxx  [suprefact; hoechst, montreal, quebec, canada]), 0.1–10 ng/ml, were used. the ranges of concentrations
were chosen according to previously established therapeutic
plasma levels of these agents (19, 20). treatment of endometrial cell cultures with  xxxd1806xxx  or with gnrha was begun
2 days after cell passage. the culture medium was replaced
with a fresh medium supplemented with hormones and was
refreshed every 2 days. at confluence, cells were washed
with serum-free rpmi, and incubation with hormones in
rpmi medium enriched with 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium-linoleic acid (becton-dickinson inc., mississauga, ontario, canada) was performed for 3 more days. cells were
then rinsed and exposed (or not exposed) to il-1␤, 0.1
ng/ml, for 6 hours. the culture supernatant was then collected and stored in small aliquots at ⫺20°c until  xxxg357xxx 
assay using elisa, as described elsewhere (21). cells were
dissociated with trypsin/ethylenediamine tetracetic acid and
stored at ⫺80°c until northern blot analysis.
for dexamethasone (sigma), cells grown to confluence
were incubated overnight with serum-free rpmi, then with
dexamethasone (10⫺12–10⫺6 m) (22) for 18 hours in the
same medium. cells were then exposed to il-1␤, 0.1 ng/ml,
for an additional 6 hours. cells and culture supernatants were
recovered as described above.
the ranges of concentrations were chosen according to
previously established therapeutic plasma levels of dexamethasone (23, 24).

northern blot analysis
total rna was extracted from cells with trizol reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (gibco brl).
the rna was size-fractionated by using electrophoresis on
1% agarose gels containing 10% formaldehyde and transferred to a hybond-n⫹ membrane (amersham, oakville,
ontario, canada). the membrane was then dehydrated at
37°c for 30 minutes, prehybridized with a hybridization
buffer composed of 5⫻ ssc; 5⫻ denhardt’s solution; 50
mm nah2po4;  xxxd3215xxx , 0.5%; salmon sperm
dna, 200 ␮g/ml; and 50% formamide. it was hybridized
with 32p-labeled  xxxg357xxx  complementary dna (atcc,
fertility & sterility威

rockville, md) in the hybridization buffer and washed with
1⫻ ssc (0.15 m  xxxd3213xxx  and 0.015 m sodium
citrate), 0.2⫻ ssc, and 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx  before
being exposed to x-ray film (biomax; eastman kodak,
rochester, ny) at ⫺80°c for about 18 hours. staining with
ethidium bromide (gibco brl) and hybridization with 28s
(svedberg), cdna probe (atcc) were performed to ensure
equal loading of rna.

statistical analysis
all experiments were repeated at least three times. data
were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance; the
tukey test was used post hoc for multiple comparisons.
p⬍.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
endometrial cells were first incubated with different concentrations of  xxxd1806xxx  in the absence of any stimulation. the
effect of  xxxd1806xxx  was difficult to ascertain because spontaneous  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion in the culture medium and
steady-state mrna levels in nonstimulated cells were barely
detectable (data not shown). on the basis of this finding, we
assessed whether  xxxd1806xxx  or other therapeutic agents used to
treat endometriosis affect  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial
cells in response to il-1, one of the major proinflammatory
cytokines. elevated concentrations of interleukin-1 were
found in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis
(25, 26). in addition, peripheral blood monocytes secrete
higher levels of il-1 in women with endometriosis (27), and
an increased number of macrophages (known to be major
source of il-1) was detected in such patients (6).
to determine the optimal concentration of il-1 that can
enable detection of possible effects of the hormonal agents,
endometrial cells were first stimulated with different concentrations of il-1␤ for varying periods. dose–response data
indicated dose-dependent stimulation of  xxxg357xxx  protein and
mrna expression during 6 hours of treatment, reaching
maximal levels at 1 ng/ml (fig. 1, a and b). secretion of
 xxxg357xxx  protein was detectable 2 hours after stimulation with
0.1 ng/ml of il-1␤ and gradually increased during 24 hours
of treatment. the highest level of mrna was measured after
6 hours of stimulation; after this point, levels decreased over
time (fig. 1, c and d) (table 1, patient 1). similar cell
response profiles were obtained in endometrial cell cultures
of two additional endometrial biopsy specimens (table 1,
patients 2 and 3), even though  xxxg357xxx  secretion at baseline
differed (data not shown). therefore, an il-1␤ concentration
of 0.1 ng/ml and 6 hours of treatment with cytokine were
subsequently used to evaluate the effect of hormonal therapeutic agents on il-1␤–induced  xxxg357xxx  expression. figure
2a shows that  xxxd1806xxx  (10⫺7–10⫺5 m) inhibited il-1␤–
induced  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion by endometrial cells in a
dose-dependent manner. this effect was also observed on
northern blot analysis of  xxxg357xxx  mrna steady-state levels

in endometrial cells, which declined as  xxxd1806xxx  concentrations increased in the culture medium (fig. 2b). interleukin1␤–induced  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion and mrna steadystate levels were also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
by dexamethasone (10⫺12–10⫺6 m), an antiinflammatory
agent known to inhibit  xxxg357xxx  expression in various cells
(22, 28, 29) (fig. 3). in contrast,  xxxd388xxx , a gnrh
agonist, had no significant effect on  xxxg357xxx  expression by
endometrial cells compared with benzalkonium chloride
used at concentrations (0.01–1 ng/ml) equivalent to those
present in the various  xxxd387xxx  acetate dilutions (0.1–10
ng/ml) (fig. 4).

reduced  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion and mrna steady-state
levels after these cells were stimulated by il-1. the  xxxd1806xxx 
concentrations that produced an inhibitory effect were well
within the range of plasma levels achieved after short-term
and long-term oral administration of this agent in a clinical
setting (18). our findings may have interesting significance.

matory process. interleukin-1 is one of the major proinflammatory cytokines detected in elevated concentrations in the
peritoneal cavity of patients with endometriosis (25, 26). the
cytokine is mainly produced by activated macrophages,
which are more actively recruited into the peritoneal cavity
(30, 31) and infiltrate the ectopic and eutopic endometrial
tissues of women with endometriosis (6, 32, 33). peripheral
blood monocytes from such women have been reported to
release increased amounts of il-1 as well (27). taken together, these data strongly suggest that il-1 may be involved

locally in cell activation and may stimulate  xxxg357xxx  secretion
by ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues.
 xxxd1806xxx , a testosterone analog, is one of the principal
hormonal agents used in the medical management of endometriosis. it acts by inhibiting gonadotropin secretion and
thus ovarian secretion of e2, creating a hypoestrogenic milieu inadequate for the development of endometriotic tissue.
moreover, this steroid analog is also known to have immuno-downregulating properties (18).  xxxd1806xxx  has been
shown to reduce serum levels of autoantibodies in women
973

with endometriosis and to inhibit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes (34, 35). in previous studies,
we have shown that e2 stimulates endometrial cell responsiveness to il-1 and increases  xxxg357xxx  gene transcription
(personal communication, annie boucher). on the basis of
these observations, it could be suggested that  xxxd1806xxx  inhibits  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells not only indirectly by reducing e2 levels, but directly through interaction
with these cells. of note, clinical data indicate that  xxxd1806xxx 
therapy in patients with endometriosis reduced peripheral
blood monocyte activation (36), the number of macrophages
that infiltrate the eutopic endometrium, and peritoneal levels
of proinflammatory cytokines produced by these cells (6,
26). these findings are in agreement with our in vitro data
and indicate that inhibition of  xxxg357xxx  expression by  xxxd1806xxx 
may account for its overall biological effects.
 xxxd1806xxx  has been shown to interact with androgens, progesterone, and the glucocorticoid receptors present on endometrial cells (19, 37) and to exert a direct inhibitory action
on their growth (20). it is still unknown whether androgens
have regulatory action on  xxxg357xxx  expression. progesterone
has been shown to inhibit  xxxg357xxx  expression by many types
of cells (38, 39), but it seems to have no direct or measurable
effect on  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells (personal
communication). these findings suggest that the direct
down-regulation of  xxxg357xxx  expression in endometrial cells
produced by  xxxd1806xxx  administration could be mediated at
least in part by androgen and/or  xxxg1601xxx .
in the present study, dexamethasone, an antiinflammatory
glucocorticoid hormone, had potent inhibitory action on
il-1–induced  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells both
at the level of protein and mrna. according to recent
studies,  xxxg1601xxx  inhibits the activity of nuclear factor-␬b, one of the main transcriptional factors that
mediates  xxxg357xxx  gene activation by il-1, by physical interaction and by inducing inhibitory-␬b.  xxxg1601xxx  can also directly interact with cis-active elements in the
promoter region of the  xxxg357xxx  gene (40, 41). thus, it is
plausible that both dexamethasone and  xxxd1806xxx  can inhibit
 xxxg357xxx  gene expression at the transcriptional level. further
studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
the inhibitory action of  xxxd1806xxx  that we observed and to
determine whether there is any effect on  xxxg357xxx  mrna
stability. we did not find a detectable direct effect of  xxxd388xxx  on  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial epithelial
cells. the presence of gnrh and  xxxg931xxx  mrna in
human endometrium was recently demonstrated (42), but it
is still unknown whether functional gnrh receptors are
expressed by endometrial cells. on the other hand, the
gnrh agonists widely used in the treatment of endometriosis are known to act mainly by inhibiting gnrh production
and release of gonadotropin hormones, which suppresses
steroidogenesis (16, 17). according to our results, which do
not indicate a direct effect of gnrh agonist on  xxxg357xxx 
974

boucher et al.

 xxxg357xxx  regulation by hormonal agents

expression by endometrial epithelial cells, gnrh agonist
would act by an indirect mechanism related to estrogen
suppression. this mechanism of action is consistent with
results of our recent studies demonstrating that e2 can potentiate  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometrial cells in response
to il-1 (personal communication, annie boucher).
in conclusion, we found a direct inhibitory action of
 xxxd1806xxx  and dexamethasone on  xxxg357xxx  expression by eutopic endometrial cells of women with endometriosis and
that  xxxd387xxx  acetate, a gnrh agonist, had no detectable
direct effect. these result may contribute to our understanding of the biochemical and biological mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of the hormonal therapeutic agents
currently used to treat endometriosis. to our knowledge,
glucocorticoids have rarely been used to treat endometriosis,
but they appeared to decrease sera embryotoxicity in a clinical setting (43). the use of these drugs may be of clinical
interest in view of the biological properties of  xxxg357xxx , levels
of which are elevated in the serum, peritoneal fluid, and
eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and in
view of the immunoinflammatory process frequently associated with the disease (44 – 46).
