abstract
previously, we described the construction of a rapid yeast bioassay stably expressing human  xxxg730xxx  ␣ (her␣) and yeast
enhanced green fluorescent protein (yegfp) in response to estrogens. in the present study, the properties of this assay were further studied
by testing a series of estrogenic compounds. furthermore, a similar assay was developed based on the stable expression of human estrogen
receptor ␤ (her␤). when exposed to 17␤-estradiol, the maximum transcriptional activity of the er␤ cytosensor was only about 40%
of the activity observed with er␣, but the concentration where half-maximal activation is reached (ec50 ), was about five times lower.
the relative estrogenic potencies (rep), defined as the ratio between the ec50 of 17␤-estradiol and the ec50 of the compound, of the
synthetic hormones  xxxd1878xxx , hexestrol and especially  xxxd2581xxx  were higher with er␣, while des was slightly more potent with er␤.
the gestagens progesterone and medroxyprogesterone-acetate showed no response, whereas the androgen testosterone showed a very
weak response. the anabolic agent, 19-nortestosterone showed a clear dose-related response with  xxxg730xxx  ␣ but not ␤. the
phytoestrogens coumestrol, genistein, genistin, daidzein,  xxxd1803xxx  and naringenin were relatively more potent with er␤. ranking of the
estrogenic potency with er␣ was: 17␤-estradiol  8-prenylnaringenin > coumestrol > zearalenone  genistein  genistin > naringenin.
the ranking with the er␤ was: 17␤-estradiol  coumestrol > genistein > zearalenone > 8-prenylnaringen  daidzein > naringenin >
genistin   xxxd1803xxx . the hop estrogen 8-prenylnaringenin is relatively more potent with er␣. these data show that the newly developed
bioassays are valuable tools for the rapid and high-throughput screening for estrogenic activity.

1. introduction
there is serious concern that chemicals in our food, water and environment may affect human health by disrupting normal endocrine function. this relates both to certain
chemicals with previously unknown hormonal properties,
and compounds used, e.g. for their growth-promoting properties in animals. on the other hand, the estrogenic properties of the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein are thought
to play a role in their putative health-enhancing properties,
such as prevention of certain cancers [1], decreased risk of
cardiovascular diseases [2], and the improvement of bone

health [3]. soy isoflavones have also been reported to prevent growth of breast cancer cells [4,5].
an important role in this apparent controversy may be
played by the two estrogen receptors (er) that have been
identified to date [6,7]. these receptors, derived from two
different genes and referred to as er␣ and er␤, both bind
to the consensus estrogen responsive element (ere) enabling the transcription of an ere-based reporter construct.
the dna-binding domains of er␣ and er␤ show a high
degree of homology but the ligand-binding domains show
only 59% homology. in general, both receptors display similar ligand-binding profiles, but phytoestrogens like genistein and coumestrol induce receptor-dependent transcription
stronger with er␤ than with er␣ [8,9]. furthermore, the
tissue distribution of er␣ and er␤ also differs substantially
[8,10]. er␤ is very important in the bone, urogenital tract,

cardiovascular system, central nervous system and the developing brain [11,12]. er␣ seems the more important receptor
type in the mammary gland and the uterus. it has been hypothesised that er␤ is important for the protection against
hyperproliferation and carcinogenesis in breast, prostate and
the gastrointestinal tract [11,13–18]. these observations led
to the hypothesis of potential differences in the biological
function and tissue-selective actions of the two receptors.
these observations also suggest the existence of two previously unrecognised pathways of estrogen signalling: via
the er␤ subtype in tissues exclusively expressing this subtype and, since estrogen receptors are known to function as
dimers [19], via the formation of heterodimers in tissues expressing both subtypes. the differences in tissue distribution
may also be very important from a pharmaceutical point of
view, as hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal
women is an increasingly significant health issue [20].
in order to investigate the properties of chemicals and the
presence of hormonally active substances in food and water, it is important to have rapid, robust and high-throughput
bioassays. the effects of estrogens on different tissues stress
the need for bioassays with both  xxxg730xxx  types.
when sensitivity is required, like in cases of small sample volumes and/or low concentrations, mammalian assays
can best be used as they display lower detection limits than
yeast-based assays [21]. however, because of the differences observed in the er␣ and er␤ activity in different
cell lines [22,23], the differences in estrogenic activities of
substances by both receptor types can as well be studied in
yeast estrogen transcription activation assays with a consensus ere-reporter construct. furthermore, toxicity of samples to yeast or mammalian cells is a potential problem in
assessing estrogenic activity in complex samples. as cytotoxicity occurs more frequently in mammalian cell assays
than in yeast assays [24,25] and because yeast is more resistant to environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals
and bacterial endotoxins [26], yeast assays can best be used
to study the estrogenic activity in such samples.
several different yeast assays have been described, all
of them using plasmid-based constructs for either the receptor or reporter construct, and ␤-galactosidase as the
reporter protein [9,27–29]. with the exception of morito
et al. [9] these assays only use the human  xxxg730xxx 
␣ (her␣). previously, we described the construction of a
rapid yeast bioassay, with constructs for the human estrogen
receptor ␣ and the ere-reporter construct stably integrated
into the genome [30]. this ere-reporter construct consists
of two consensus eres with a centre-to-centre spacing
of 40 bp that was placed in a truncated  xxxg568xxx  promoter.
furthermore, yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein
(yegfp) was used as reporter protein, allowing a much
easier and more rapid detection of estrogenic activity. in the
present study, we describe the development and properties
of a similar assay based on the stable expression of human
 xxxg730xxx  ␤ (her␤). in order to validate both assays, a large number of compounds with known estrogenic

properties were tested. these include natural hormones and
their conjugated forms and metabolites, synthetic hormones
like  xxxd2054xxx , estradiolbenzoate and des, phytoestrogens like genistein, coumestrol and daidzein, the mycotoxin zearalenone and its derivatives, and environmental
pollutants like p-nonylphenol.

were made in either ethanol or dmso as indicated.
2.2. yeast strain
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae (cen.pk 102-5b,
k20, ura3− , his3− , leu− ) was a gift from h. silljé
(university of utrecht).
2.3. plasmids
for the expression of the human  xxxg730xxx  ␣,
the p403-gpd yeast expression vector was used. for the
expression of the human  xxxg730xxx  ␤, the p405-

t.f.h. bovee et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 91 (2004) 99–109

gpd yeast expression vector was used. for the construction
of the reporter plasmid, the p406- xxxg568xxx  yeast expression
vector was used. all three plasmids were obtained from
the american type culture collection (atcc, rockville,
maryland, usa) and are described by mumberg et al.
[31].
2.4. construction of the p405-gpd- xxxg731xxx  receptor
expression vector
the construction of the p403-gpd-er␣ receptor expression vector, that contains the his3 marker gene, is already
described in bovee et al. [30]. the p405-gpd-er␤ receptor expression vector, containing the leu marker gene, is
made in a similar way. briefly, synthesis of cdna was carried out on isolated mrna of t47d human breast cancer
cells and of mrna isolated from human intestinal caco-2
cells. full-length human  xxxg730xxx  ␤ cdna was
obtained by pcrs using the t47d cdna, marathon uterus
cdna (human, clontech) and the human intestine cdna
with the expand high fidelity pcr system (boehringer
mannheim). pcr was performed using the following conditions: 34.2 ␮l ultra pure water, 5 ␮l 25 mm mgcl2 , 5 ␮l
expand hf 10× concentrated buffer (without mgcl2 ),
0.8 ␮l 25 mm dntp mix, 1 ␮l of the enzyme mix, 2 ␮l of
the different cdnas and 2 ␮l of a primer mix containing
10 ␮m of each primer were pipetted into a thin-walled pcr
tube and pcr was performed in an eppendorf mastercycler
gradient using the following cycle profile: (1) denature template 3 min at 95 ◦ c; (2) denature template 30 s at 94 ◦ c;
(3) anneal primers 1 min at 60 ◦ c; (4) elongation 2 min at
72 ◦ c; (5) go to step (2) and repeat 35 times; (6) elongation 7 min at 72 ◦ c; and (7) for over 10 ◦ c. after this first
pcr, a second pcr was performed with the same conditions as described above but now 2 ␮l of the first pcr
mixture was used instead of 2 ␮l of the different cdnas.
the sequence of the 5 -primer was as follows: 5 -cgtctagagctgttatctcaagacatggatataa-3 and this
primer contains a restriction site for xbai just before the
atg start codon. the sequence of the 3 -primer is as follows: 5 -taggatccgtcactgagactgtgggttctg3 and this primer contains a restriction site for bamhi
just after the tga stop codon. this pcr generated a fulllength ds cdna of 1626 bp containing the 1593 bp coding
sequence of the human  xxxg730xxx  ␤ gene with a 5 xbai and a 3 -bamhi restriction site just outside the coding
sequence. this full-length er␤ pcr product was isolated
from a 1% low-melt agarose gel and ligated into a pgem-t
easy vector (promega). plasmid digestion control revealed
several good clones and good clones were sequenced in
both directions using the seq 4×4 apparatus and the
thermo sequenase cy5.5 dye terminator cycle sequencing
kit, all used according to the manufacturers instructions
(amersham pharmacia). all 1593 bp, from the atg start to
the tga stop, were compared with the  xxxg730xxx  ␤
sequence published by ogawa et al. [32].

101

compared to this sequence, the er␤ cdna clone obtained from the breast cells contained two mutations. the bp
at position #430 consisted of t instead of a and #1030 consisted of g instead of a. both mutations resulted in changed
codons that will change the amino acid translated from it,
arginine to tryptophan and from methionine into valine, respectively. probably this clone also misses a g at bp position
#216. this clone was therefore not used. the er␤ cdna
clone obtained from human uterus contained five mutations.
the bp at position #349 consisted of c instead of t, #601 c
instead of t, #800 g instead of a, #965 c instead of t and
#1245 consisted of g instead of a. the mutations at bp positions #349 and #1245 result in changed codons, but these
changed codons will be translated into the same amino acids
as the original codons. however, the mutations at bp positions #601, #800 and #965 result in changed codons that also
change the amino acid that will be translated from it, cysteine to arginine, glutamine to arginine and from leucine
to proline, respectively. this clone was therefore not used.
the er␤ cdna clone obtained from human intestine contained 7 a nucleotides instead of 6 a nucleotides at bp position #9 to #14. this will result in a frame shift that changes
the entire sequence and therefore this clone was not used.
to obtain a cdna clone that is fully complementary to
the sequence published by ogawa et al. [32], the xbai–msci
part from this intestine er␤ cdna clone, containing the
7 a instead of 6 a, was replaced by the xbai–msci part
of the uterus er␤ cdna clone. although the uterus er␤
cdna clone contained five mutations, the first mistake is at
bp position #349 and so the xbai–msci part of this clone
does not contain any mistake. in this way a human er␤
cdna clone was obtained that fully corresponded to the
 xxxg730xxx  ␤ sequence published by ogawa et al.
[32]. this uterus/intestine human er␤ cdna was cut out
of the pgem-t easy plasmid with xbai and bamhi and
cloned into the corresponding xbai–bamhi site of the p405gpd expression vector. this p405-gpd-er␤ vector was
used to transform epicurian coli xl-2 blue cells. plasmid
digestion controls and pcr controls of single white colonies
were performed and revealed several good clones (data not
shown).
2.5. construction of yeast heralpha and herbeta cytosensors
the yeast cytosensor expressing the her␣ is the one
already described in bovee et al. [30]. the yeast cytosensor
expressing the her␤ and the yeast cytosensor that expresses
both er␣ and er␤ are made in a similar way. briefly,
construction of yeast her␣ and her␤ cytosensors was
started with the stable transformation of yeast k20 (ura− ,
his− and leu− ) with the p406-ere2 s2- xxxg568xxx -yegfp reporter vector, integrated at the chromosomal location of the
uracil gene via homologous recombination. transformants
were grown on mm/lh plates and pcr and southern blot
hybridisation were used to select clones in which the integration has occurred at the desired ura3 site with only a

102

t.f.h. bovee et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 91 (2004) 99–109

single copy of this reporter vector. subsequently, this yeast
reporter strain was stably transformed with the p403-gpder␣, the p405-gpd-er␤ or both expression vectors and
transformants were grown, respectively on mm/l, mm/h
or mm plates. actually, the cytosensor containing both receptor types was made by transforming the er␣ cytosensor
with the p405-gpd-er␤ receptor expression vector.
2.6. yeast culturing conditions
before running an assay, an agar plate containing the selective mm/l, mm/h or mm medium was inoculated with
the yeast er␣, er␤ or er␣/␤ cytosensor, respectively from
a frozen −80 ◦ c stock (20% glycerol, v/v). the plate was
incubated at 30 ◦ c for 24–48 h and then stored at 4 ◦ c. the
day before running the assay, a single colony of the yeast
cytosensor was used to inoculate 10 ml of the corresponding
selective medium. this culture was grown overnight at 30 ◦ c
with vigorous orbital shaking at 225 rpm. at the late log
phase the yeast er␣ cytosensor culture was diluted (1:10)
in mm/l, the yeast er␤ cytosensor was diluted (1:20) in
mm/h and the yeast er␣/␤ cytosensor was diluted (1:20)
in mm. this minimal medium (mm) consisted of yeast
nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulphate
(1.7 g/l), dextrose (20 g/l) and ammonium sulphate (5 g/l).
the mm/l and mm/h medium were supplemented with lleucine (60 mg/l) or  xxxd2282xxx  (2 mg/l), respectively.
2.7. yegfp assay: exposure to different substances and
the measurement of estrogenic activities
for exposure in 96 well plates (costar), aliquots of 200 ␮l
of the yeast culture were pipetted into each well. exposures
to different doses of 17␤-estradiol and all the other substances were performed through the addition of 1 ␮l of an
ethanol or dmso stock solution to each well, resulting in
0.5% final concentration of the solvent. ethanol and dmso
only controls were included in each experiment and each
sample concentration was assayed in triplicate. exposures
were performed for 4 and 24 h. fluorescence at these time
intervals was measured directly in the cytofluor multi-well
plate reader (series 4000, perseptive biosystems) using excitation at 485 nm and measuring emission at 530 nm. the
densities of the yeast culture at these time intervals were
also determined by measuring the od at 630 nm. this was
done to check whether a substance was toxic for yeast. if
there were no differences in yeast densities, the fluorescence
signals were corrected with the signals obtained with the
blank medium (supplemented mm containing 0.5% ethanol
or dmso solvent only).

3. results
recombinant yeast cells were constructed that either express the human  xxxg730xxx  ␣, ␤ or both, and yegfp

in response to exposure to estrogens. all constructs, both the
receptor construct as well as the reporter constructs, were
stably integrated into the yeast genome by the use of yeast
integrating plasmids. the construction of the yeast cell expressing the her␣ was described previously, including that
of the cdna encoding for the alpha receptor [30]. this
cdna, constructed from mrna of t47d cells, had the same
sequence as described by greene et al. [33]. the construction of cdna for the her␤-receptor was initially attempted
from the mrnas isolated from t47d human breast cancer
cells, human intestinal caco-2 cells and from human uterus
cdna. since all three cdnas contained mutations in comparison to the sequence published by ogawa et al. [32], the
eventual cdna introduced into the yeast cytosensor was
constructed from the latter two cdnas (see section 2.4).
a number of compounds with known estrogenic properties were tested in the er␣-assay. as shown in fig. 1, compounds like des,  xxxd2054xxx , and genistein all caused
a dose-related increase in the production of green fluorescent protein after a relatively short exposure period of 4 h.
dose–response curves were similar after 24 h but in general
allowed a better curve-fit (fig. 2a and 2b).
fig. 3 shows the dose–response curve for 17␤-estradiol
obtained after 4 h with the yeast cytosensors expressing
her␣, her␤ or both the her␣ and her␤ receptors. the
maximal transcriptional activity of the er␤ cytosensor is
only about 40% of the maximal activity observed with the
er␣ cytosensor, but the er␤ cytosensor showed a higher
response at lower concentrations. this is reflected in the
much lower ec50 for 17␤-estradiol, the concentration where
half-maximal activation is reached, being 0.06 and 0.6 nm,
respectively for the er␤ and er␣ cytosensor. in contrast
to the er␣ cytosensor, the dose–response curves obtained
with the er␤ and the er␣/er␤ cytosensors after a 24 h
exposure period were very poor (data not shown).
fig. 4a and 4b show dose–response curves obtained with
the er␤ cytosensor after a 4 h exposure to a number of different compounds. table 1 shows the calculated ec50 values
for 17␤-estradiol, a number of metabolites and other hormonal substances, as obtained by a mathematical non-linear
regression curve-fit formula (y = a0+a1/(1+(x/a2)∧ a3)).
the relative estrogenic potencies (rep) of these substances,
defined as the ratio between the ec50 of 17␤-estradiol and
the ec50 of the compound, with both the er␣ and the er␤
cytosensor are also shown in table 1. fig. 5 presents a graphical comparison of these ec50 values. these data show that,
e.g. estrone, the main metabolite of 17␤-estradiol, showed a
rep of 0.2 with er␣ and 0.1 with er␤. other metabolites
of e2␤, like the hydroxy metabolites and the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, are much less potent than e2␤ itself,
displaying relative potencies of less than 0.05. however, the
hydroxy-metabolites are more potent than the conjugated
forms. there are only small differences between the relative potencies with er␣ and er␤ of these natural hormones
and their conjugated forms and metabolites. however, like
estrone, the conjugated forms ( xxxd2046xxx  and estrone

table 2 shows the ec50 values and reps for the phytoestrogens and resorcyclic acid lactones. based upon these

8-prenylnaringenin > coumestrol > zearalenone  genistein
 genistin > naringenin. for er␤, the ranking is as follows: 17␤-estradiol  coumestrol > genistein > zearalenone

nearly all compounds were tested twice and some of them
even three times. the differences in the determined ec50
and rep values were very small and negligible (data not
shown). the variation in the determined ec50 values for the
17␤-estradiol reference (see tables 1 and 2) is mainly due to
the solvent used, either ethanol or dmso [30]. the variation
due to inter-experimental differences is less important. to

4. discussion
the present paper demonstrates the successful construction of yeast cells stably expressing the human estrogen receptors ␣ and ␤, and producing green fluorescent protein in
response to compounds with known estrogenic properties. in
addition to the biomolecular controls, this is clearly shown
by the very reproducible dose-related transcription activation of the yegfp gene in both yeast er␣ and er␤ cytosensors after exposure to 17␤-estradiol (figs. 1–4). the poor
dose–response curves obtained with the er␤ and er␣/er␤
cytosensors after 24 h exposure indicates that the er␤ receptor protein is not as stable as the er␣ or that a complex
with the er␤ receptor is involved in a quicker signalling
pathway.
one of the potential applications of the cytosensors is
their use for detecting increased hormonal activity in sam-

ples of illegally treated animals. therefore, it is essential to
obtain data on the estrogenic potency of known and putative metabolites and to show the specificity of the assay for
estrogenic compounds. the data in table 1 show that the
cytosensors are specific for estrogens, since the gestagens
progesterone and  xxxd2554xxx , and the
androgen testosterone did not show a clear response. only
19-nortestosterone gave a full dose–response curve, but this
compound appears to have both androgenic and estrogenic
properties, possibly explaining its excellent anabolic properties requiring both types of hormonal activity. here, we
show for the first time that 19-nortestosterone is a full agonist
with er␣ and that this compound is relatively more potent
with er␣ than it is with er␤ (table 1, fig. 5). a number
of metabolites of 17␤-estradiol and estrone showed a clear
response, but in general at least a factor 5 to 105 less then
their parent compounds. there are only small differences
between the relative potencies with er␣ and er␤ of the natural hormones and their conjugated forms and metabolites.
however, like estrone, the conjugated forms e1-3-sulfate
and e1-␤-d-glucuronide and metabolites 2-oh-e1 and 4oh-e1 appear to be slightly more potent with er␣ than with
er␤. the glucuronidated forms of 17␤-estradiol, e2␤-3-

fig. 5. relative estrogenic potencies (rep) of all compounds with the er␣ and er␤ cytosensor. exposure to 17␤-estradiol and other substances was
started by adding to 200 ␮l of a yeast culture of the corresponding cytosensors, an aliquot of 1 ␮l of a stock solution, using either ethanol or dmso as
a solvent as indicated in tables 1 and 2. fluorescence was determined after 4 or 24 h as described in section 2 (see section 2.7) and as indicated in
tables 1 and 2. the growth promoters are: des, hexestrol,  xxxd1878xxx ,  xxxd2581xxx  and 19-nort; e1 con. and met. are: e1,  xxxd346xxx -e1, 4oh-e1, e-3-sulfate
and e1-␤-d-glucuronide; zear are: z-lenone, z-lanone, ␣-z-lenol, ␣-z- xxxd1683xxx , ␤-z-lenol and ␤-z- xxxd1683xxx ; phytoestrogen are: coumestrol, genistein, genistin,
daidzein,  xxxd1803xxx , nar and 8-prenyln; no diff. are: e2␤,  xxxd2054xxx , e2-benz, e3,  xxxd346xxx -e2, 4oh-e2, e2-sul and np; and the e2-gluc. are: e2-3-gluc and
e2-17-gluc. the line x = y and the dotted lines x = 3y and 3x = y are also shown. compounds between the lines have more or less the same activity
with er␣ and er␤, whereas compounds above the upper dotted line are three times or more active with er␤ than with er␣. compounds below the
lower dotted line are three times or more active with er␣ than with er␤.

␤-d-glucuronide and e2␤-17-␤-d-glucuronide, on the other
hand seem slightly more potent with er␤ (see fig. 5) and
17␣-estradiol is more potent with er␣. the present data
also show that for testing of, e.g. urine of calves a deconjugation step is a requirement for gaining sensitivity. as 1%
deconjugation of the 17␤-estradiol conjugates would already
result in a rep of 0.01 and as the reps of these conjugates are much lower than 0.01 and because dose–response
curves after a relatively short exposure period of 4 h were
similar to those after 24 h, it is most likely that yeast is
not able to deconjugate these compounds. for the same reasons the estrogenic activity of ␤- xxxd2038xxx , rep
of 8.6e−3, is probably not due to metabolic conversion of
the ester. in the present study, no attempts were made to investigate the metabolism of the test compounds by the cells,
which may result in activation or deactivation of compounds
and may explain possible differences in estrogenic potencies
with other test systems [8,9,21–29].
a specific difference in the ligand-binding properties of
the two receptors is the affinity for phytoestrogens [8,9].
as described previously, the isoflavones genistein, genistin,
daidzein and  xxxd1803xxx , the coumestran coumestrol and the
flavonoid naringenin were relatively more potent with er␤
than with er␣ (see table 2 and fig. 5). coumestrol and
genistein were by far the most potent of these compounds

with er␤. however, 8-prenylnaringenin, a phytoestrogen
present in hops, was relatively more potent with er␣ than
with er␤ and was actually the most potent phytoestrogen
with er␣. until now, comparison of 8-prenylnaringenin
with er␣ and er␤ was only performed in a receptor binding assay [34], revealing comparable binding activity to
both receptor forms. here we describe for the first time,
that 8-prenylnaringen is more potent with er␣ than with
er␤, using a yeast transcription activation assay. although,
the data obtained from transcription activation assays are
in general comparable with results from radioligand competition binding assays, kuiper et al. also observed that although coumestrol bound to the er␤ with the same affinity as 17␤-estradiol, transcription activation started at 1000
times higher concentrations for coumestrol [8]. furthermore,
ligand-binding assays do not disclose the biological activity
of a compound, i.e. whether it is an agonist or an antagonist
and therefore, transcription activation assays are supposed
to correspond better with effects found in vivo. the characteristics of 8-prenylnaringenin, being a very potent compound that is relatively more potent with er␣ than with
er␤, are in agreement with effects described upon the intake of the female flowers of the hop plant, as they have long
been used as a preservative. more recently, they have also
been included in some herbal preparations for women for

breast enhancement [34,35]. both applications indicate that
8-prenylnaringenin is an active agonist with er␣. naringenin, a flavonoid present in citrus fruits, is relatively more
potent with er␤, but compared to 8-prenylnaringenin, this
compound is only a weak estrogen. the lignans enterolactone and enterodiol did not show any response with both
receptor types and are therefore characterised as being nonestrogenic in our yeast cytosensors.
there are no great differences between the relative potencies of zearalenone and its derivatives with both receptor
types (table 2, fig. 5). however, compared to the natural phytoestrogens, zearalenone is about as potent as the
most potent phytoestrogens coumestrol, genistein and 8prenylnaringenin, whereas the derivatives ␣-zearalenol and
␣-zearalanol are even more potent. the latter is not unexpected, since ␣-zearalanol is used as a legal growth promoter
for cattle breeding in the us [36]. very similar reps for this
series of resorcyclic acid lactones have been reported by le
guevel and pakdel [37], also using a yeast assay with her␣.
recently, iccvam [38] included the environmental pollutant 4-n-nonylphenol [casrn 104-40-5] as a positive
control in a set of reference compounds for transcriptional
activation assays. in our hands this compound did not show
a response in neither of the yeast cytosensors. others how-

ever, have reported 4-n-nonylphenol to be active in these
type of assays [39,40]. thorough review of these studies
showed that a technical mixture like the one available from
fluka (approximately 85–92.7% of branched isomers) or
p-nonylphenol (cas no. 84852-15-3) was used instead
of the unbranched nonyl chain. when the 4-nonylphenol
technical mixture of fluka was used, it also showed a
dose–response curve in our test with an ec50 of 100 nm
(see table 1). chemical analysis with gc/ms showed that
there was actually no 4-n-nonylphenol, the aliphatic straight
chain, in this technical mixture of fluka (data not shown).
from this, it can be concluded that 4-n-nonylphenol is not
estrogenic and that the estrogenicity of the technical mixture
is due to one or more isomers with a branched side-chain. a
similar conclusion was presented by pedersen et al. studying the induction of plasma vitellogenin in rainbow trout
by linear and technical nonyl- and octylphenol [41].
the relatively very high estrogenic potencies of estrone
and 4-hydroxyestradiol, as observed in the er-calux
assay with t47d cells, giving rise to reps of 1.0 and 0.45,
respectively [42], were not observed with our er␣ cytosensor, in which reps of 0.2 and 0.0026, respectively were
observed. this possibly points to important differences
between yeast cells and mammalian cells, in for example

108

t.f.h. bovee et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 91 (2004) 99–109

the metabolism and absorption of compounds and the transcription activation pathway. however, as shown in the case
of  xxxd343xxx  and estrone for metabolism [8,42] and for
transcription activation [22,23], similar differences exist
between different mammalian cell lines. this yeast assay
therefore represents another appropriate assessment of the
relative activity of various estrogens.
in general the response obtained for e2␤ with the er␣
receptor is in a similar dose-range as described for yeast by
other authors [9,27,37,40]. the lower maximum response
for er␤, as compared to er␣, has been reported for mammalian cells as well [22,23], but the observation that the
yeast cells expressing er␤ show a response at lower concentrations of 17␤-estradiol has not been observed previously.
morito et al. [9] used a yeast estrogen assay and found that
the dose–response curve obtained with 17␤-estradiol for the
yeast expressing the er␣ was similar to the one obtained
with the yeast expressing the er␤. in chinese hamster ovary
cells (cho) transiently transfected with an er␣ or er␤
expression construct and an ere-based reporter construct,
the transcriptional activity after exposure to 17␤-estradiol
of er␤ was only about 50% of the activity observed with
er␣. however, in this study with cho cells, half-maximal
activation was reached at lower concentrations for er␣
than for er␤, giving ec50 values for 17␤-estradiol of 0.04
and 0.3 nm, respectively [7,22]. at the same time, this latter study also revealed that the ability of er␤ to function
as an estrogen-dependent transcriptional activator is highly
dependent on the cellular context. it was shown that in
human endometrial cancer (hec-1) cells and mda-231
breast cancer cells transcription activation after exposure to
17␤-estradiol by er␤ was respectively only about 15% and
less than 5% of the transcriptional activity by er␣. in this
case, half-maximal activation was again reached at lower
concentrations for er␣ than for er␤. similar results were
obtained with human embryonal kidney 293 cells.
another interesting observation is the apparent lower response in the cells expressing both receptor types (fig. 3),
indicating that either er␤ is dominating in the possible heterodimers or that er␤ prevents the formation or activity
of the er␣ homodimer. thus, just like er(beta)cx [17], it
seems that er␤ is a dominant repressor of er␣ function,
at least in the case of yeast. these differences between both
receptor types might reflect characteristics of the er␤ and
support the hypothesis that er␤ may have a role in protection against hyperproliferation and carcinogenesis. therefore, the repressor (er␤) has to be more sensitive to 17␤estradiol, explaining the lower ec50 for er␤ than for er␣,
but the maximum response should be lower, repressing the
activity of the er␣. even a lower stability of the repressor
(er␤) could support this hypothesis, as repressor activity is
not needed all the time in a cell. also, the inability to obtain
a full-length cdna of the er␤ without any mutations (see
section 2.4) from mrna isolated from the human t47d
breast cancer and caco-2 colon cancer cells, might point at
a contribution of an inactivated er␤ function, to the origin

of the cancer. at the same time, this observation stresses the
need to reinvestigate the identity and functionality of the estrogen receptors in the different bioassays used for testing
estrogenic activity.
in conclusion, both the er␣ cytosensor and er␤ cytosensor show clear dose–response curves when exposed to
estrogenic compounds. these yegfp assays are not only
very sensitive, as shown by ec50 values for e2␤ of 0.5 and
0.06 nm for the er␣ and er␤ cytosensor, respectively, but
are also very rapid, convenient, reproducible and most likely
more robust than cell-lines. both cytosensors can be used
to study the estrogenicity of different compounds in order
to determine the relative estrogenic potency of these compounds. since good dose–response curves can be obtained
after only 4 h of exposure, the often questioned permeability of the yeast cell wall does not seem to be an obstacle in
our yeast estrogen assay.
