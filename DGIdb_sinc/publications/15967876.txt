the delayed rectifier potassium current (ik) is the principal current responsible for cardiac repolarization. ik is subdivided into the rapidly and slowly activating components ikr
and iks, respectively (sanguinetti and jurkiewicz, 1990). the
human ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg), encodes the
pore-forming subunit of the ikr channels (sanguinetti et al.,
1995; trudeau et al., 1995). reduction of ikr results in the
prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration and
causes the human long qt syndrome (lqts) (keating and
sanguinetti, 2001), a disorder of myocellular repolarization
that predisposes affected persons to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (keating
and sanguinetti, 2001). congenital lqts is relatively rare,

the present study, we examined the effect of inactivation gating
on  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg. modulation of herg inactivation
was achieved by either changing extracellular k⫹ or cs⫹ concentrations or by mutations of the channel. we found that
although inactivation facilitated  xxxd1708xxx  block of the herg k⫹
current, it was not coupled with  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg when
the cs⫹ current was recorded. furthermore,  xxxd1708xxx  block of
the herg k⫹ current was not linked with inactivation in the
mutant herg channels f656v and f656m. our results suggest
that inactivation facilitates  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg channels
through affecting the positioning of phe-656.

but acquired lqts is far more frequent and is a side effect of
a variety of common medications. in theory, a reduction of
any voltage-gated k⫹ current that contributes to ventricular
repolarization could cause lqts. however, almost all known
drugs that cause lqts preferentially block the herg channels (roden et al., 1996; mitcheson et al., 2000a). herg
blockade by different drugs represents one of the major concerns in drug safety. thus, it is imperative to understand the
molecular mechanisms that underlie drug-induced herg
channel block.
herg displays a characteristic fast voltage-dependent inactivation gating. when depolarized, herg channels open at
a rate slower than that of inactivation (smith et al., 1996;
spector et al., 1996). upon repolarization, inactivated channels quickly reopen and then deactivate. hence, depolarized
herg channels exist primarily in either the open or the
inactivated state (smith et al., 1996; spector et al., 1996).
previous studies have shown that for most herg-blocking
agents, block develops only when the channel is depolarized
(kiehn et al., 1996; snyders and chaudhary, 1996; zhang et
al., 1999), suggesting that one or both of the depolarizationinduced states (open versus inactivated) represent high-af-

abstract
many commonly used medications can cause long qt syndrome and thus increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. high-affinity human ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg)
 xxxg1232xxx  blockade by structurally diverse compounds is almost exclusively responsible for this side effect.
understanding drug-herg channel interactions is an important
step in avoiding drug-induced long qt syndromes. previous
studies have found that disrupting herg inactivation reduces
the degree of drug block and have suggested that the inactivated state is the preferential state for drug binding to herg
channels. however, recent studies have also shown that inactivation does not dictate drug sensitivity of herg channels. in

materials and methods
molecular biology. we made three mutations in the pore and s6
region to assess the role of inactivation in the  xxxd1708xxx  block of
herg channels. the s620t mutation was made to remove herg
inactivation gating (ficker et al., 1998; zhang et al., 1999). the
f656v and f656m mutations were made to modify  xxxd1708xxx  binding
to herg. the f656v and f656m mutations were selected for two
reasons. first, the phe-656 residue of herg has been shown to be a
molecular determinant of high-affinity dofetilide and  xxxd1708xxx  binding (lees-miller et al., 2000; mitcheson et al., 2000a). second, these
mutant channels have been shown to display properties that are
similar to those of wt channels (lees-miller et al., 2000; fernandez
et al., 2004).
herg cdna in pcdna3 was obtained from dr. gail a. robertson
(university of wisconsin, madison, wi) (trudeau et al., 1995). point
mutations in the p-loop and s6 of herg were introduced via pcr
using overlap extension (ho et al., 1989) (table 1).
the forward and reverse flanking primers were designed to cover
two unique restriction sites (bsteii at nucleotide 2038 and sbfi at
nucleotide 3093). the first round of pcrs was performed using the
forward flanking primer-reverse mutant primer and the reverse
flanking primer-forward mutant primer. in the first round of pcrs,
the total reaction volume was 50 ␮l, including 50 pmol of each
primer, 70 ng of herg cdna, and 0.125 units of vent dna polymerase (new england biolabs, beverly, ma). reaction temperatures
were varied using a thermal cycler (mycycler; bio-rad, hercules,
ca): 95°c for 120 s; 94°c for 60 s, 55°c for 60 s and 72°c for 60 s for
30 cycles; and 72°c for 10 min. the resulting pcr products were
used as templates and amplified by flanking primers in a second
round of pcr. the final pcr product was digested with bsteii and
sbfi and ligated to herg expression plasmid digested with the same

two restriction enzyme sites. all mutations were verified by using a
high-throughput 48 capillary abi 3730 sequencer (ucdna services,
university of calgary, calgary, ab, canada).
herg s620t, f656v, and f656m mutant channels were transiently expressed in hek 293 cells (american type culture collection, manassas, va). hek 293 cells were seeded at 5 ⫻ 103 cells/
60-mm diameter dish. the cells were transiently transfected using
10 ␮l of lipofectamine with 4 ␮g of herg mutant expression vector.
after 24 to 48 h, at least 50% of cells expressed channels. nontransfected hek 293 cells contain a small-amplitude background current
that is usually less than 100 pa upon a depolarizing pulse to 50 mv.
thus, the effects of overlapping endogenous currents of hek 293
cells on the expressed current are minimal (zhou et al., 1998).
a hek 293 cell line stably expressing herg channels was obtained from dr. craig january’s lab (university of wisconsin, madison, wi) (zhou et al., 1998), where the herg cdna (trudeau et al.,
1995, 1996) was subcloned into bamhi/ecori sites of the pcdna3
vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the stably transfected cells were
cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and contained 400 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  to select for transfected cells. for electrophysiological study, the cells were harvested
from the culture dish by trypsinization and stored in standard minimal essential medium at room temperature for later use. cells were
studied within 8 h of harvest.
patch-clamp recording method. the whole-cell, patch-clamp
method was used. the pipette solution contained 135 mm kcl or
cscl, 5 mm egta, 1 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm hepes, ph adjusted
to 7.2 with koh or csoh. the bath solution contained 10 mm
hepes, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm mgcl2, 2 mm cacl2, and 135 mm
nacl and was adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh. for recordings in the
presence of different external k⫹ or cs⫹ concentrations, the concentration of na⫹ was reduced as the k⫹ or cs⫹ concentration was
elevated to maintain a constant osmolarity, and the ph was adjusted
to 7.4 with the appropriate hydroxide solution. all chemicals were
from sigma (st. louis, mo).
aliquots of cells were allowed to settle on the bottom of a ⬍0.5-ml
cell bath mounted on an inverted microscope (te2000; nikon, tokyo,
japan). cells were superfused with specific bath solutions. the bath
solution was constantly flowing through the chamber and the solution was changed by switching the perfusates at the inlet of the
chamber. this bath solution change took 10 s. patch electrodes were
fabricated using thin-walled borosilicate glass (world precision instruments, sarasota, fl). the pipette had an inner diameter of ⬃1.5
␮m and a resistance of ⬃2 m⍀ when filled with the pipette solution.
an axopatch 200b amplifier was used to record membrane currents.
computer software (pclamp9; axon instruments, foster city, ca)
was used to generate voltage clamp protocols, acquire data, and
analyze current signals. data were filtered at 5 to 10 khz and
sampled at 20 to 50 khz for all protocols. in most cases, 80% series
resistance compensation was used and leak subtraction was not
used. conductance/voltage data were fitted to a single boltzmann

finity states for drug binding. it has been found that mutations of herg that disrupt inactivation reduce herg block
by e-4031, dofetilide, and verapamil (ficker et al., 1998;
zhang et al., 1999), suggesting that the inactivated state
forms the high affinity receptor for drug binding. however, a
recent study suggested that the positioning of s6 aromatic
residues relative to the central cavity of the channel, not
inactivation per se, determines the drug block of herg channels (chen et al., 2002).
it has been reported that the elevation of extracellular k⫹
concentration ([k⫹]o) relieves drug block of ikr/herg channels (yang and roden, 1996; wang et al., 1997). because
most herg blockers access herg channels from the cytosolic side of the membrane (zhang et al., 1999, 2001;
mitcheson et al., 2000b), whether intracellular k⫹ concentration ([k⫹]i) regulates drug binding to herg channels is
relevant.
in the present study, we used the well studied herg
blocker  xxxd1708xxx  (mohammad et al., 1997; mitcheson et al.,
2000a; chen et al., 2002; fernandez et al., 2004) to investigate the molecular mechanisms of drug-herg channel interactions. whole-cell patch-clamp technique (zhang et al.,
2003b) was used to record currents from the wild-type (wt)
and mutant herg channels heterologously expressed in
hek 293 cells. by using cs⫹ permeation and site-directed
mutations, we have found that when intracellular k⫹ was
replaced by cs⫹ or when phe-656 was mutated to valine or
methionine, the  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg channels was no
longer dependent on inactivation gating. we propose that
inactivation re-orientates phe-656 to a position that favors
high-affinity binding of  xxxd1708xxx  to herg channels, and the
presence of intracellular k⫹ is required for this process.

changes in extracellular k⫹ concentration ([k⫹]o) have
been shown to influence the binding of drugs such as dofetilide and e-4031 to ikr/herg channels (yang and roden,
1996; wang et al., 1997). we found that the potency of  xxxd1708xxx  block of the wt herg channel was also strongly
modulated by [k⫹]o as demonstrated in fig. 1, d and e.
figure 1d shows the superimposed currents before and after
exposure to 50 nm  xxxd1708xxx  in bath solutions containing 0, 5,
or 135 mm k⫹ with a pipette solution containing 135 mm k⫹.
from a holding potential of ⫺80 mv, herg currents were
evoked by a depolarization to 50 mv for 4 s, followed by a step
to ⫺50 mv to record tail current. because  xxxd1708xxx  is reported to bind to herg only after the channel opens (mohammad et al., 1997), a series of depolarizing pulses was
delivered every 15 s until a steady-state block was reached.
the blocking effects were measured by the degree of peak tail
current suppressions. the  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg is
strongly [k⫹]o-dependent. as can be seen in fig. 1d, 50 nm
 xxxd1708xxx  blocked ⬃80% of the current in the absence of [k⫹]o,
⬃60% at 5 mm [k⫹]o, and ⬃20% at 135 mm [k⫹]o. to obtain
a concentration-dependent relationship for block of herg
current by  xxxd1708xxx , six to eight cells were studied at each
drug concentration. under each [k⫹]o condition, the tail current peak amplitude was normalized to the respective control
value and was plotted as relative current amplitude against
 xxxd1708xxx  concentration (fig. 1e). data points were fitted to

external k and inactivation gating regulate  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg channels. consistent with previous
studies (mohammad et al., 1997; mitcheson et al., 2000a;
chen et al., 2002), we found that  xxxd1708xxx  potently blocks
herg channels in a stably transfected hek 293 cell line.
figure 1, a and b, shows families of current traces from one
cell for control conditions (fig. 1a) and after exposure to 100

(i-v) relationships of the pulse currents measured at the end

the pulse and tail currents.

control conditions, depolarizing steps activated a time-dependent outward current that increased in amplitude as voltage
steps became more positive. the inward rectification seen in
wt herg channels was absent (fig. 2c). in the presence of
100 nm  xxxd1708xxx , the s620t current displayed a time-dependent decay during the depolarizing steps (fig. 2b).  xxxd1708xxx 
has been shown to preferentially block activated (open) channels (mohammad et al., 1997). therefore, the decay reflects
time-dependent drug binding to open channels. because release of  xxxd1708xxx  block occurs during the resting potential,
the time-dependent block could be observed upon each depolarization (mohammad et al., 1997; zhang et al., 1999). figure 2c shows the i-v relationship of currents measured at
the end of depolarizing steps in control and in the presence of
100 nm  xxxd1708xxx .
the  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg s620t channels and its [k⫹]o
dependence were studied in fig. 2, d and e. herg channels
were activated by a depolarizing pulse to ⫹50 mv for 4 s
every 15 s. there was no clear sign of inactivation in control
recordings. unlike wt channels, the s620t mutant channel
was blocked by  xxxd1708xxx  in a [k⫹]o-independent manner.
the steady-state block measured at the end of a 4-s depolarizing step under each  xxxd1708xxx  concentration was normalized to its control value. four to seven cells were studied at
each concentration, and the blocking effects were plotted
against  xxxd1708xxx  concentrations. the data were fitted to the

the hill equation. the half-maximal inhibition concentration
(ic50) for  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg current was 7.5 ⫾ 0.8 nm
at 0 [k⫹]o, 24.1 ⫾ 1.2 nm at 5 mm [k⫹]o, and 108.8 ⫾ 12.9 nm
at 135 mm [k⫹]o. the ic50 values are significantly different
from one another (n ⫽ 6–8 cells for each data point, p ⬍ 0.01).
the corresponding hill coefficients were 0.8, 1.0, and 1.0,
respectively, suggesting that the occupation of a single binding site accounts for the block by  xxxd1708xxx .
because [k⫹]o regulates herg inactivation and because
inactivation has been shown to play an important role in
high-affinity drug binding to herg channels (zhang et al.,
1999, 2003a), we assessed the role of herg inactivation in
altering  xxxd1708xxx  block at different [k⫹]o. we constructed an
inactivation-deficient mutant herg channel, s620t (fig. 2).
the s620t mutation lies in the s5-s6 linker of the channel
pore. previous studies have shown that this mutation interferes with the c-type inactivation and modifies the blocking
of herg channels caused by dofetilide, clofilium, and verapamil (suessbrich et al., 1997; ficker et al., 1998; zhang et
al., 1999). consistent with these previous reports, we found
that the conservative substitution of serine with threonine at
position 620 resulted in a complete removal of inactivation.
figure 2, a and b, shows families of the s620t currents from
one cell for control conditions (fig. 2a) and after exposure to
 xxxd1708xxx  (fig. 2b). the cell was clamped at a holding potential of ⫺80 mv. depolarizing steps were applied for 4 s to
voltages between ⫺70 and ⫹70 mv in 10-mv increments. for

intracellular kⴙ modulation of  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg

wt herg cs⫹ currents display features very similar to
those of k⫹ currents, except there is a larger outward current
peak upon depolarization which decays quickly as channels
inactivate (see fig. 5a for the current voltage relationships of
cs⫹ current).  xxxd1708xxx  blocked herg cs⫹ current in a
concentration dependent manner. however, as shown in fig.
3, in contrast to that of the k⫹ current,  xxxd1708xxx  block of
herg cs⫹ current was entirely independent of extracellular
cs⫹ concentration ([cs⫹]o) which has been shown to slow
herg inactivation gating (zhang et al., 2003a). the ic50 for
 xxxd1708xxx  at [cs⫹]o of 0, 5, or 135 mm was 173.6 ⫾ 12.6,
191.5 ⫾ 9.4, and 195.6 ⫾ 20.6 nm, respectively (n ⫽ 4–7
cells). the corresponding hill coefficients were 1.3, 0.9, and
1.0, suggesting that the occupation of a single binding site
accounts for the block of herg cs⫹ current by  xxxd1708xxx .
to address the effect of [cs⫹]o on the inactivation time
course of the cs⫹ current, herg cs⫹ current was fully
activated and inactivated by a depolarizing step to ⫹40 mv
for 500 ms. the cell was then repolarized to ⫺100 mv for 10
ms to allow recovery from inactivation but not enough to
allow significant deactivation of the herg channels (smith
et al., 1996; spector et al., 1996; zhang et al., 2003a). a test
step was then applied to different voltages to observe inactivation time courses every 15 s. the inactivation time constant (␶inact) was obtained by fitting the current decay to a
single exponential function. data in fig. 4, a–c, show herg
cs⫹ currents during the test steps to voltages between ⫹20
and 120 mv in 20 mv increments at 0 (a), 5 (b), or 135 mm
[cs⫹]o (c). the expanded traces during the test pulses are
shown in fig. 4, d–f. the averaged ␶inact in 0 (e), 5 (f), and

not regulate  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg cs⫹ currents.
whole-cell cs⫹ currents were recorded with a pipette
solution containing 135 mm cs⫹ and bath solutions
containing 0, 5, or 135 mm cs⫹. a, cs⫹ current recorded in absence and presence of 200 nm  xxxd1708xxx  at
[cs⫹]o of 0, 5, and 135 mm. the currents were elicited
by depolarizations to ⫹50 mv from a holding potential
of ⫺80 mv. the depolarization was followed by a repolarization to ⫺50 mv to record the tail currents. b,

mv were normalized to the control and plotted versus
 xxxd1708xxx  concentration. fits to data points at 0 (f), 5
(œ), or 135 mm [cs⫹]o () to the hill equation are
shown.

mm was 49.5 ⫾ 2.1, 77.5 ⫾ 6.0, and 87.7 ⫾ 11.5 nm, respectively (n ⫽ 4–7 cells). the hill coefficients for the fits were
1.0, 1.2, and 1.0 at 0, 5, or 135 mm [k⫹]o, respectively.
two observations are obvious. first, the s620t mutation
reduced the sensitivity of the herg channel to  xxxd1708xxx . for
example, at [k⫹]o of 0, the ic50 of  xxxd1708xxx  block of s620t
was 49.5 nm, which is significantly higher than the ic50 (7.5
nm) for the wt channels (p ⬍ 0.01). second, compared with
wt channels, the [k⫹]o dependence of  xxxd1708xxx  block was
significantly diminished in the s620t mutant channel. for
example, whereas changing [k⫹]o from 135 mm to 0 increased  xxxd1708xxx  block in the wt channel by 14.5-fold, the
same decrease in [k⫹]o increased  xxxd1708xxx  block of the
s620t channel by only 1.8-fold (p ⬍ 0.01). these results
indicate that the [k⫹]o dependence of  xxxd1708xxx  block of the
wt herg channel is largely related to the ability of [k⫹]o to
slow herg inactivation gating.
 xxxd1708xxx  block of herg csⴙ current is independent of inactivation gating. we have found that herg
channels display a unique high permeability to cs⫹ (zhang
et al., 2003a). because  xxxd1708xxx  blocks herg by binding to
the internal cavity of the channel (mitcheson et al., 2000a),
we hypothesized that intracellular k⫹ ([k⫹]i) may play a role
in drug binding to the herg channel. we reasoned that
intracellular cs⫹ (cs⫹i) may differ from [k⫹]i in regulating

depolarizing steps to voltages between ⫺70 and 70 mv for 4 s
followed by a repolarizing step to ⫺50 mv (fig. 5, a and b,

in control conditions, the herg current was activated at

135 mm [cs⫹]o (œ) in five to eight cells are plotted as a
function of test potential in fig. 4g. elevated [cs⫹]o slowed
herg cs⫹ current inactivation at all voltages tested. for
example, ␶inact at 60 mv increased from 6.7 ⫾ 0.9 ms in the
absence of [cs⫹]o (n ⫽ 8) to 23.2 ⫾ 5.7 ms at 5 mm [cs⫹]o (n ⫽
7, p ⬍ 0.01), and to 198.7 ⫾ 23.6 ms at 135 mm [cs⫹]o (n ⫽
5, p ⬍ 0.01). thus, elevation of [cs⫹]o markedly slowed
herg inactivation. the effects of [cs⫹]o on the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation were also studied. to
construct the steady-state inactivation, ratios of the current
measured 100 ms after the onset of inactivation relative to
instantaneous peak current at each test potential were calculated. the ratios were normalized to the maximal value,
plotted as a function of the test voltage, and fitted to a
boltzmann function (fig. 4h). data were obtained from five
to eight cells. the half-inactivation voltage and slope factor
were ⫺7.9 ⫾ 0.7 and 16.2 ⫾ 0.7 mv at 0 [cs⫹]o, 5.6 ⫾ 0.6 and
16.7 ⫾ 0.6 mv at 5 mm [cs⫹]o, and 24.7 ⫾ 1.2 and 15.1 ⫾ 1.3
mv at 135 mm [cs⫹]o, respectively. elevation of [cs⫹]o significantly shifted the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve to more depolarized potentials (p ⬍ 0.01) without
significantly affecting the slope factor (p ⬎ 0.05). these results demonstrated that changing [cs⫹]o significantly slowed
herg inactivation but did not affect  xxxd1708xxx  block of the
cs⫹ current. therefore,  xxxd1708xxx  block and inactivation gating was not coupled in herg cs⫹ current recordings.
to further evaluate the role of inactivation in the  xxxd1708xxx 
block of the herg cs⫹ current, effects of  xxxd1708xxx  on the wt
and s620t cs⫹ currents were compared (fig. 5). the pipette

potential was ⫺80 mv. figure 6b shows the i-v relationship
of the f656v pulse currents. the outward currents measured
at the end of 4-s depolarizing pulses were plotted against
depolarizing voltages. the herg f656v current was activated at voltages positive to ⫺50 mv, and the maximum
current was reached at 0 mv. at more positive voltages,
inward rectification was apparent because of the rapid voltage-dependent inactivation (smith et al., 1996; spector et al.,
1996; zhang et al., 1999). figure 6c shows the activation
curve for the f656v channel. tail current amplitude was
used to construct the activation curve (n ⫽ 5 cells), which
shows that the threshold voltage for the f656v channel activation was close to ⫺40 mv. the channels were fully activated at voltages ⬎20 mv. when fitted to a boltzmann function, the half-maximum activation voltage (v1/2) and slope
factor (k) were ⫺10.1 ⫾ 2.7 mv and 8.7 ⫾ 0.6, respectively.
these values are not significantly different from those in wt
channels (v1/2, ⫺11.1 ⫾ 4.0 mv; k, 7.9 ⫾ 0.7 mv). to assess
deactivation of the f656v channel, the decay of tail currents
at ⫺50 mv were fitted to double exponential functions. the
fast and slow components of deactivation time constants
(␶deact) at ⫺50 mv were 186.1 ⫾ 13.4 and 723.9 ⫾ 42.3 ms
(n ⫽ 5), respectively. the fast component accounted for 0.59
of the current amplitude. for wt channels, the fast and slow
components of ␶deact at ⫺50 mv were 370.5 ⫾ 18.9 and
1762.2 ⫾ 156.5 ms (n ⫽ 6), respectively. the fast component
accounted for 0.47 of the current amplitude. therefore, the
f656v channel displayed a significantly faster deactivation
than the wt channel (n ⫽ 5 or 6, p ⬍ 0.01).
figure 6, e and f, shows the i-v relationship (e) and the
activation curve of f656m (f). the v1/2 and slope factor were
⫺17.1 ⫾ 3.7 mv and 7.2 ⫾ 0.4, respectively (n ⫽ 5). although
the v1/2 of f656m displayed a moderate but significant shift
to the negative potentials (p ⬍ 0.05), the slope factor of
f656m was not different from that of wt channels. the
deactivation time course of f656m was evaluated at ⫺50 mv.
the fast and slow components of ␶deact at ⫺50 mv were
385.4 ⫾ 45.1 and 2092.4 ⫾ 190.8 ms, respectively (n ⫽ 5). the
fast component accounted for 0.42 of the current amplitude.

 xxxd1708xxx  almost completely blocked the s620t cs⫹ current.
to quantify the potency of  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg current,
the concentration-dependent relationships were constructed
with four to six cells studied at each drug concentration. for
wt channels, herg channels were activated and inactivated by a depolarization to 50 mv, the peak tail current
upon repolarization to ⫺50 mv was recorded to measure the
channel block. for s620t channels, block was measured by
current amplitudes at the end of a depolarizing step to 50
mv. the current amplitudes in the presence of  xxxd1708xxx  were
normalized to the control and plotted against  xxxd1708xxx  concentration (fig. 5c). data points were fitted to the hill equation. the ic50 for the wt and s620t channels were 173.6 ⫾
12.6 nm (n ⫽ 6) and 194.9 ⫾ 19.6 nm (n ⫽ 4) with a hill
coefficient of 1.3 and 0.9, respectively. these concentrationdependent relationships were similar. thus, in contrast to
the k⫹ current, the blocking of the herg cs⫹ current by
 xxxd1708xxx  is independent of the inactivation gating.
phe-656 of herg is involved in the inactivationfacilitated  xxxd1708xxx  block of kⴙ current. our results
thus far have demonstrated that when [k⫹]i is replaced by
[cs⫹]i,  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg is no longer affected by
herg inactivation gating. this indicates a critical role of
[k⫹]i in the state-dependence of  xxxd1708xxx  binding to herg
channels. phe-656 has been shown to be critical for  xxxd1708xxx 
binding to herg channels (mitcheson et al., 2000a). we
hypothesized that the positioning of phe-656 may differ between open and inactivated state, and this may affect the
binding of  xxxd1708xxx  to herg channels. the positioning of
phe-656 may be influenced by the types of the permeating
ions. therefore, k⫹ and cs⫹ will result in different phe
positioning, ultimately affecting  xxxd1708xxx  binding. when
cs⫹ is permeating the channel, the optimal positioning of
phe-656 for  xxxd1708xxx  binding may be less favored. to test the
role of phe-656 in the inactivation-induced changes of drug
affinity, we mutated phenylalanine at 656 to valine or methionine. figure 6 shows the activation properties of the
herg f656v (a–c) and f656m (d–f). the currents were
recorded in 135 mm [k⫹]i and 5 mm [k⫹]o by 4-s depolarizing
steps to voltages between ⫺70 and ⫹70 mv. the holding

a modest effect. we found that  xxxd1708xxx  block of both f656v
and f656m channels was not affected by changes of [k⫹]o
which modulate inactivation gating of both channels (see fig.
7). the ic50 for  xxxd1708xxx  block of f656v at 0, 5, or 135 mm
[k⫹]o was 99.9 ⫾ 7.5, 101.1 ⫾ 5.7, and 134.3 ⫾ 13.2 nm,
respectively (p ⬎ 0.05, n ⫽ 4–7 cells). the corresponding hill
coefficients were 1.2, 1.3, and 1.0, respectively. the ic50 for
 xxxd1708xxx  block of f656m at 0, 5, or 135 mm [k⫹]o was 27.6 ⫾
2.1, 30.6 ⫾ 4.1, and 34.0 ⫾ 2.8 nm, respectively (p ⬎ 0.05, n ⫽

discussion
the exact role of inactivation in mediating drug block of
herg is not well understood. in the present study, we found
that  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg was significantly attenuated by
the impairment of inactivation gating. first, elevation of
[k⫹]o, which slows inactivation, reduced the degree of  xxxd1708xxx  block. second, the inactivation deficient mutant s620t
had a reduced  xxxd1708xxx  affinity. site-directed mutagenesis
has identified aromatic residues, particularly phe-656 in the
s6 transmembrane domain of herg subunits, to be one of
the most important molecular determinants of high-affinity
binding to herg channels for many drugs such as mk-499,
dofetilide,  xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, quinidine, and chloroquine
(lees-miller et al., 2000; mitcheson et al., 2000a). to assess
whether the facilitation of  xxxd1708xxx  binding by inactivation
gating is via the phe-656 site, we evaluated the effects of
[k⫹]o on  xxxd1708xxx  block of f656v and f656m channels. we
reasoned that if phe-656 is involved in the inactivation-induced facilitation of  xxxd1708xxx  binding to herg channels,
changing inactivation gating by [k⫹]o might differently affect
the ic50 of herg f656v and f656m. indeed, we found that
block of both mutant channels by  xxxd1708xxx  was not affected
by changing [k⫹]o, indicating that phe-656 is involved in the
inactivation-induced high-affinity binding of  xxxd1708xxx  to
herg channels. the loss of [k⫹]o regulation of  xxxd1708xxx -

these values were not significantly different from those of
wt channels.
figure 7 compares the inactivation properties of wt channels (a), f656v (b) and f656m mutant channels (c). figure
7a shows the voltage dependence of the inactivation time
course of k⫹ currents from wt, f656v, and f656m at 5 mm
[k⫹]o. the inactivation time constant (␶inact) was obtained by
fitting the currents to a single exponential function at each
test voltage. the averaged ␶inact in 0, 5, and 135 mm [k⫹]o
(n ⫽ 6–8 cells) are plotted against test potentials in fig. 7b.
although there was no significant difference in the ␶inact
between the wt and f656v channels, ␶inact was significantly
smaller for the f656m channel. for example, the mean time
constants at 20 mv in the absence of [k⫹]o were 9.2 ⫾ 0.9,
7.4 ⫾ 1.2, and 6.3 ⫾ 0.4 ms for wt, f656v, and f656m
channels, respectively (n ⫽ 5⬃6 cell each, p ⬎ 0.05 between
wt and the f656v, and p ⬍ 0.05 between wt and the
f656m). despite the small difference of ␶inact between wt
and the f656m channel, elevation of external k⫹ caused a
similar slowing of the inactivation time course in the wt,
f656v, and f656m channels. fig. 7c shows the steady-state
inactivation relationships at different [k⫹]o of wt, f656v,
and f656m channels. the data were fitted to a boltzmann
function. the half-inactivation voltage (v1/2) and slope factor
(k) values are summarized in table 2. although the inactivation properties of f656v were similar to those of wt channels, the v1/2 for the f656m was significantly more negative
than that of wt (n ⫽ 5, p ⬍ 0.01). however, despite a
moderately accelerated inactivation for the f656m channel,
elevation of [k⫹]o caused a similar shift of the steady-state
inactivation in the wt, f656v, and f656m channels to the
depolarized direction without significantly affecting the slope
factors.
consistent with the concept that phe-656 is a critical site
for drug binding, both f656v and f656m affected  xxxd1708xxx 
binding to the channel (fig. 8). although the f656v mutation
significantly reduced  xxxd1708xxx  affinity, the f656m had only

mediated block of f656v and f656m channels does not result
from the altered drug sensitivity of the mutant channels. in
our study, the f656v herg mutation displayed reduced
 xxxd1708xxx  sensitivity, but the f656m mutant channel displayed  xxxd1708xxx  sensitivity similar to that of wt channels at
5 mm [k⫹]o. the difference of the  xxxd1708xxx  affinity between
the f656v and f656m seems to be related to the measures of
hydrophobicity at the position 656. the potency for block of
herg by  xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, and mk-499 correlate well
with measures of hydrophobicity, especially the two-dimensional approximation of the van der waals hydrophobic surface area of the side chain of residue 656 (fernandez et al.,
2004). the van der waals hydrophobic surface area of methionine more closely resembles that of phenylalanine than does
the hydrophobic surface area of valine (fernandez et al.,

863

2004). however, although the methionine residue mimics
more closely the phenylalanine residue with regard to hydrophobicity, both methionine and valine lack the aromatic ring
of phenylalanine, which may be important for the inactivation-facilitated  xxxd1708xxx  binding to the channel. based on
the crystal structure of the kcsa k⫹ channel (doyle et al.,
1998), phe-656 of herg (thr-107 in kcsa) faces the central
cavity of the intracellular mouth of the channel. the presence
of a phenylalanine at this site in herg seems to be important in creating a binding site for dofetilide, quinidine, mk499, terfenadine, and  xxxd1708xxx  (lees-miller et al., 2000;
mitcheson et al., 2000a). these compounds consist of an
aliphatic chain with benzene rings at each end. benzene
rings are known to stack via ␲ bonds, and it is possible that
the benzene head groups of  xxxd1708xxx  could interact with the

benzene ring of phenylalanine. because of the structural
nature, we propose that the positioning of the benzene ring of
phenylalanine is more likely to be affected by the channel’s
inactivation gating, which affects drug binding. on the other
hand, the positioning of the methionine residue may be less
likely to be affected by the inactivation gating. therefore,
although f656m displayed  xxxd1708xxx  sensitivity similar to
that of the wt channels, it lost the [k⫹]o dependence of the
 xxxd1708xxx  block.
the loss of [k⫹]o regulation of  xxxd1708xxx -mediated block of
f656v and f656m channels seems not to have been caused
by the altered channel gating behaviors. the inactivation
properties of f656v were similar to those of wt channels,
whereas the f656m displayed a slightly accelerated inactivation. like wt channels, elevation of [k⫹]o significantly
slowed inactivation of both f656v and f656m mutant channels. we have found that the f656m mutation moderately

shifted the activation curve to hyperpolarized potentials.
this result is consistent with data presented in a previous
report (fernandez et al., 2004). we also found that the activation properties of f656v were not altered, but deactivation
of the f656v was significantly faster than wt channels. the
finding of the accelerated deactivation of the f656v is consistent with the previous studies (lees-miller et al., 2000;
fernandez et al., 2004). it seems that the accelerated deactivation may not be the primary cause for the reduction in
drug sensitivity for the f656v. the f656w mutation significantly alters the voltage dependence of activation/deactivation gating, but this mutation does not significantly alter the
ic50 values for the block by mk-499,  xxxd1708xxx , and terfenadine (fernandez et al., 2004).
the present study also revealed that the intracellular k⫹
is involved in modulating  xxxd1708xxx  binding during inactivation gating. we found that when cs⫹ replaces intracellular

k⫹, inactivation gating no longer affects the  xxxd1708xxx -mediated block of herg. with cs⫹ ions in the pipette solution,
the ic50 values of  xxxd1708xxx  were similar between the wt and
inactivation-deficient s620t channels. although elevation of
extracellular cs⫹ concentration significantly slowed the cs⫹
current inactivation of wt herg channels, it did not alter
the  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg cs⫹ current. furthermore, we
observed that altering inactivation affects the ic50 of  xxxd1708xxx  block of herg less than does intracellular cs⫹ replacement and that cs⫹ replacement further reduced the ic50 of
 xxxd1708xxx  in the inactivation-deficient mutant channels. for
example, whereas s620t inactivation-deficient mutation reduced the  xxxd1708xxx  affinity by 6.6-fold in a bath solution
containing 135 mm na⫹, under the same bath solution replacement of the intracellular [k⫹]o by cs⫹ reduced the  xxxd1708xxx  affinity of wt channels by 23-fold. replacement of
intracellular [k⫹]o by cs⫹ also reduced the  xxxd1708xxx  affinity
of s620t inactivation-deficient channels by 4-fold (ic50 from
49.5 to 194.9 nm; figs. 2 and 5) in a bath solution containing
0 k⫹ and cs⫹ (135 mm na⫹). these results argue against
inactivation as being the sole primary determinant of drug
block.
the mechanism by which cs⫹ replacement affects  xxxd1708xxx  block is not known but may be related to the positioning
of the drug binding site. c-type inactivation reflects a stabilized p-type inactivation and s5–s6 arrangements might be
involved in this process to affect the selectivity filter and
adjacent structures. on the other hand, the permeant ions
may modify the selectivity filter and adjacent structure
(zhou and mackinnon, 2004). the occupancy of the selectivity filter by particular permeant ions might stabilize a conformation of the s5–s6 arrangement. we propose that the
s5–s6 is stabilized by k⫹ ions to a molecular state/position in
which inactivation gating can further induce a conformational change that increases  xxxd1708xxx  affinity to the channel.
in contrast to k⫹, cs⫹ stabilizes the s5–s6 in a different
molecular state/position such that inactivation gating cannot
increase  xxxd1708xxx  affinity to the channel. thus, in addition to
direct interactions or via changes in channel inactivation, k⫹
ions are also critical for maintaining a proper conformation of
the channel required for drug-channel interactions.
in summary, we have found that both intracellular k⫹ and
phe-656 are required for inactivation-related high-affinity
 xxxd1708xxx  binding to herg. we propose that intracellular k⫹
ions stabilize the herg channel in a state in which inactivation can alter the receptor site of phe-656 to a position that
favors high-affinity  xxxd1708xxx  binding. our findings suggest a
possible explanation for how inactivation gating facilitates
drug affinity to herg channels. it has been shown that block
of na⫹ or ca2⫹ channels by many drugs is facilitated by
channel inactivation. whether intracellular k⫹ plays a role
in the state dependent block of na⫹ or ca2⫹ channels by
drugs (hille, 1977; hondeghem and katzung, 1984) requires
further investigation.
