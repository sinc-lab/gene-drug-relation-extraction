abstract
thyroid hormone receptors (tr) are members of the
nuclear receptor superfamily. there are at least two tr
isoforms, tr and tr, which act as mediators of thyroid
hormone in tissues. however, the relative expression of
each tr isoform in target tissues is still elusive. herein,
we have developed an rt-pcr and restriction enzyme
digestion method to determine the expression of tr1
and tr1. we analyzed the expression of tr isoforms in
3t3-l1 preadipocytes induced to diﬀerentiate by an
adipogenic cocktail in the presence or absence of 100 nm
triiodothyronine (t3). the tr1 isoform was predominantly expressed in 3t3-l1 adipocytes, and its expression
was increased at the stage of development concomitant
with the emergence of lipid droplets. little, if any, tr1
mrna was detected in adipocytes. administration of t3
to the diﬀerentiating 3t3-l1 cells enhanced the accumulation of triglyceride. the expression profile of tr1 in

t3-treated adipocytes was similar to that in non-treated
cells. the transcripts of adipogenic factors, ccaat/
enhancer binding protein  (c/ebp) and peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor  (ppar), were not
altered by t3. lipid binding protein, ap2, that is downstream of these transcription factors was also unaﬀected by
t3. in contrast, the lipogenic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase mrna was significantly increased in the presence of t3. therefore, t3 appears to be
a hormone capable of modulating the expression of lipogenic enzyme and augments the accumulation of lipid
droplets. we conclude that the tr isoform might play
an important role in the generation and maintenance of the
mature adipocyte phenotype, regulating the expression of
lipogenic enzymes.

introduction

part, to missing a critical portion of the amino terminal
ligand-binding region (koenig et al. 1989, lazar et al.
1989). despite a high degree of structural homologies,
minor divergence in the amino-terminal sequences of tr
isoforms may modulate an isoform-dependent function.
the extensive and tissue-specific action of thyroid
hormone has been well documented, but little is known
about the relative contribution of each tr isoform to t3
action in target tissues. initial attempts to determine the
role of each of the tr proteins indicated the wide
distribution of tr1, tr2, and tr1 mrnas among
target tissues, whereas tr2 mrna is limited to the
anterior pituitary or to a certain region of the central
nervous system (thompson et al. 1987, hodin et al. 1989,
wood et al. 1991). schwartz et al. (1992) compared the
concentration of tr and tr mrna to nuclear t3
binding capacity in rat tissues by using specific antibodies
against each tr type. marked variation in the ratio of the

thyroid hormone, 3,5,3 -triiodothyronine (t3), exerts
profound eﬀects via nuclear thyroid hormone receptors
(trs) on energy metabolism, homeostasis, development
and diﬀerentiation in all vertebrates (evans 1988, lazar
1993). there are at least two thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
(tr) genes, designated as tr and tr, each of which
generates two or more mrnas and polypeptide products
through alternate splicing or alternative promoter (sap
et al. 1986, weinberger et al. 1986, benbrook & pfahl
1987, wrutniak et al. 1995). to date, three functional
trs have been described: tr1, tr1 and tr2,
which can bind t3 and regulate transcription by binding
to specific thyroid hormone response elements within
promoters of their target genes (lavin et al. 1988, harvey
& williams 2002). in addition, a variant molecule, tr2,
does not bind t3 and may act to inhibit t3 action due, in

· tr in 3t3-l1 adipocytes

expression of tr isoforms among tissues raises the question of redundancy and specificity of tr isoforms in target
tissues.
adipose tissue that consists of white adipose tissue
(wat) and brown adipose tissue (bat) plays a vital role
in lipid metabolism and energy balance. thyroid hormone
modulates the development and metabolism of adipose
tissue in both physiological and pathological conditions.
previous studies showed that the numbers of adipocytes
were increased or decreased in hyper- or hypothyroid
animals (picon & levacher 1979). recently, it has been
reported that thyroid hormone is an adipogenic factor in
the ob17 adipocyte cell line where t3 regulated adipocyte
proliferation, as well as induced preadipocyte diﬀerentiation (darimont et al. 1993, gharbi-chihi et al. 1993). on
the other hand, some studies supported the view that
thyroid hormone increased basal oxygen consumption and
lipolysis (oppenheimer et al. 1991, viguerie et al. 2002).
the contradictory data might be obtained by using diﬀerent cell types or distinct experimental conditions, which
indicate the intricate eﬀects of thyroid hormone on adipose
tissue. it has been shown that trs are expressed in wat
and bat (reyne et al. 1996), but the precise isoformdependent function in adipose tissue has not been clarified.
in the present study, we have developed an rt-pcr
and restriction enzyme digestion method to define the
relative roles of the tr1 and tr1 isoforms in 3t3-l1
adipocytes. our observations suggest that tr1 plays a
role in adipocytes through regulating the expression of
lipogenic enzymes.

materials and methods

oil red o staining
3t3-l1 cells were grown on 24-well plates and induced to
diﬀerentiate as described above. after incubation for 8
days (day 8), plates were washed three times with
phosphate-buﬀered saline (pbs), fixed with 7% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, then replaced with
fresh fixing solution and incubated for at least one hour.
after fixation, cells were stained with a filtered oil red o
solution (0·5 g oil red o (sigma) in 100 ml isopropanol) for
15 min at room temperature. cells were then washed
twice with distilled water and visualized under the
microscope.
after the microscopic examination, we quantified the
amount of triglyceride in each well. isopropanol (300 µl/
well) was added to the staining plates and the plates were
incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then the
optical density (od) of the solution at 500 nm was
measured.
to distinquish between tr and tr isoforms using
rt-pcr and the restriction enzyme digestion method
we designed one common primer set for the amplification
of the ligand-binding domain (lbd) of the tr and
tr isoforms. the primer sequences are: trs p1 5 gaagaccagatcatcctcct-3 and p2 5 -agg
aagcggctggc-3 . pcr amplification of both tr
and tr isoforms produces a 426 bp product, but after
digestion with the tr-specific restriction enzyme, pst i,
the tr transcript is converted into two fragments of
222 bp and 204 bp; meanwhile, the tr transcript is left
intact as a 426 bp fragment.

cell culture and diﬀerentiation

rna isolation and rt-pcr

the mouse 3t3-l1 preadipocytes were obtained from the
american type culture collection (manassas, va, usa)
and were grown at 37 c in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% calf serum
(gibco), 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin
in 24-well plates or 100 mm2 plates. two days after cell
confluence (designated as day 0), diﬀerentiation was initiated with 1 µg/ml insulin, 1 µm dexamethasone (dex),
and 0·5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) in dmem
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) in the presence
or absence of 100 nm t3. after incubation for 2 days (day
2), the culture media were replaced with dmem supplemented with 10% fbs and 1 µg/ml insulin, and the cells
were then fed every two days with dmem containing
10% fbs. 3t3-l1 cells were fully diﬀerentiated by day 8.
for t3-treated cells, t3 was added to the media over the
full course of the diﬀerentiation.
in the above mentioned experiments, fbs was
depleted from t3 by anion exchange resin (teboul et al.
1991).

total rna was extracted from 3t3-l1 cells harvested at
the indicated time points during diﬀerentiation using an
rneasy kit (qiagen) and quantified by spectrophotometry. first-strand cdna was synthesized by mulv reverse
transcriptase with oligo (dt) primer (roche). the cdna
was used as a template for pcr to amplify the specific
product. the sequences of each set of primers are listed

order to allow the discrimination of contaminating
genomic dna from cdna. in control experiments,
rt-pcr was performed under the same experimental
conditions but lacking reverse transcriptase. rt-pcr
products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis
in tae buﬀer (40 mm tris-acetate ph 8·0, 2 mm
edta) and stained with ethidium bromide. identities of
the pcr products were confirmed by using an abi 310
sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa).
northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated from 3t3-l1 cells at the indicated
time points during the diﬀerentiation process using the
rneasy kit (qiagen). fifteen micrograms total rna
were size fractionated in 1% denaturing agaroseformaldehyde gel, then transferred to a hybond-n+
nylon membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech) and
cross-linked with uv light (stratalinker, stratagene,
la jolla, ca, usa).
hybridizations were performed in expresshybtm

with cdnas labeled with [32p]dctp using a random
hexamer labeling kit (amersham pharmacia biotech). the
results were visualized using a phosphor imager (fuji bas

elongation factor- that was considered as an internal
control.

t3 increases the accumulation of lipid droplets in 3t3-l1
adipocytes
to assess the role of thyroid hormone receptors in adipocytes, we first tried to examine the eﬀect of thyroid
hormone on the diﬀerentiating 3t3-l1 cells. two days
after cell confluence (day 0), diﬀerentiation was induced
by adipogenic stimuli in the absence or presence of
100 nm t3. cytoplasmic triglyceride droplets were visible
by day 3. the oil red o staining of these cells on day 8 is
shown in fig. 1a. in the presence of an adipogenic
cocktail, 3t3-l1 cells revealed a morphological appearance of mature adipocytes, converting from a fibroblastlike to a spherical shape and containing large lipid-laden
droplets in the cytoplasm (fig. 1a). compared with

figure 2 t3 exerts its effect at the late stage of differentiation.
quantitative analysis of triglyceride accumulation. 3t3-l1
preadipocytes were treated with differentiation-permissive medium
(dex,  xxxd2388xxx  and insulin) and cultured for 8 days. the data are
derived from two independent experiments and represent the
means s.d. control, without adipogenic mixture and t3; t3 (),
cells were cultured in the differentiating media in the absence of
100 nm t3; t3 (+) day 0, 100 nm t3 were added to the
differentiating media on day 0; t3 (+) day 3, 100 nm t3 were
added to the differentiating media on day 3.

t3 increased droplet accumulation by about 1·5-fold
(fig. 1b), indicating that thyroid hormone enhances lipid
accumulation in mature adipocytes.
in general, the process of adipocyte diﬀerentiation can
be divided into three stages: early, intermediate and late
(ntambi & young-cheul 2000). to ascertain at which
stage t3 exerts its eﬀect on triglyceride accumulation, 100 nm t3 were added to the media containing
an adipogenic cocktail at various time points during
diﬀerentiation, and the accumulation of lipid droplets in
cytosol was monitored on day 8. consistent with the
results above, a similar increment of lipid accumulation
was observed in adipocytes treated with t3 on the third
day (day 3) (fig. 2), suggesting that the addition of t3 to
the media at the late stage of diﬀerentiation is suﬃcient for
increasing lipid accumulation.
the expression of tr1 in 3t3-l1 adipocytes
because the structure of the lbds of tr1 and
tr1 have a high degree of similarity, a common
primer set can be used to amplify both receptor isoforms.
although the pcr products from both transcripts are
indistinguishable in length, the tr1 but not the tr1
transcript has a unique pst i restriction enzyme site in the
middle region of the pcr products, and produces two
fragments after restriction enzyme digestion (fig. 3). here
we amplified the same array of the lbds of tr1 and
tr1 from plasmid templates containing each cdna in a
single pcr reaction as a 426 bp product (fig. 3, lane 1 and
lane 2), using a common primer set. after digestion of the

tr and tr from each cdna template (lane 1, tr; lane 2, tr),
and digestion of the pcr products with pst i restriction enzyme
(lane 3, tr; lane 4, tr).

pcr product with pst i enzyme, the tr1 transcript
produced fragments of 222 bp and 204 bp (fig. 3, lane 3)
while the 426 bp product of the tr1 transcript remained intact (fig. 3, lane 4). thus, in these experiments,
a reliable simplified method for the comparison of the
expression of tr1 with tr1 isoform has been
established.
to determine the expression of tr1 and tr1 in
3t3-l1 adipocytes, pcr amplifications were performed
on cells submitted to synchronization experiments. figure
4a illustrates the rt-pcr results obtained at diﬀerent
days of diﬀerentiation (day 0 to 4). it appears that tr was
already present in preadipocytes, and the expression level
of tr mrna was increased on day 3 and day 4 after
inducing diﬀerentiation. pst i digestion converted almost
all of the pcr products into 222 bp and 204 bp fragments,
indicating that tr1 is predominantly expressed in
3t3-l1 preadipocytes and throughout diﬀerentiation.
strikingly, tr1 mrna was hardly detectable at any
stage, even when pcr cycles were extended up to 35
cycles to increase the sensitivity (fig. 4a). these results
indicate the importance of tr1 isoform as a master
regulator of thyroid hormone signaling in adipocytes. as
shown in fig. 4, tr1 was expressed at all stages
examined and its expression level was increased at the
stage concomitant with emergence of lipid droplets on day
3 and day 4, which is in close agreement with the results
shown in fig. 2. the expression pattern of the tr1
isoform was not altered by t3 throughout the entire period
of diﬀerentiation (fig. 4b). in control experiments, elongation factor- mrna levels were constant during the
diﬀerentiation period.

and c/ebps families (brun et al. 1996, schwarz et al.
1997, rosen et al. 2000). these results led us to investigate whether t3 regulates the expression of these
transcription factors.
to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of
thyroid hormone action in 3t3-l1 cells, rt-pcr was
performed with rna samples isolated at various time
points of the diﬀerentiation process. figure 5 illustrates the
expression profiles of adipogenic factors during diﬀerentiation in the absence or presence of 100 nm t3. the
expression of c/ebp was increased very early and
transiently under standard conditions as reported by
ntambi & young-cheul (2000). the expression level of
c/ebp was not aﬀected by the administration of t3. the
transcript for ppar, whose induction may be regulated
by c/ebp, began to be increased as early as day 1 and
rose progressively during the diﬀerentiation process. as
shown in fig. 5, no significant diﬀerence in the expression
pattern of the ppar transcript was detected between the
absence and presence of t3. the adipocyte-selective fatty
acid binding protein, ap2, that is known to be downstream
of these adipogenic transcription factors, was increased
over the basal level from day 2 to day 8. the expression of
ap2 was also unaﬀected by t3. however, t3 increased the
expression of the lipogenic enzyme  xxxg861xxx  involved in
lipid metabolism at the terminal phase of diﬀerentiation. in
control experiments, elongation factor- mrna levels
were expressed constantly.
www.endocrinology.org

as shown in fig. 6, similar results were obtained in
northern blot analysis. we could not detect any considerable alteration by t3 in the expression of the adipogenic
factors c/ebp and ppar, nor in their downstream factor, ap2. however, the peak levels and also the
basal expression levels of the  xxxg861xxx  transcript were
augmented by the addition of t3. quantitative determination using phospho imager revealed that t3 increased
the expression of  xxxg861xxx  by 2-fold and 1·7-fold on days
3 and 4 respectively (fig. 7). elongation factor- mrna
expression was not altered by t3 (data not shown).
discussion
as lipid metabolism is closely associated with a number of
health problems, regulation of adipocytes represents an
area of emerging interest. so far, tr has been implicated
as a major factor in the regulation of the development and
function of adipose tissue (flores-delgado et al. 1987,
chawla & lazar 1993, dace et al. 1999, yen 2001). in this
paper, we demonstrate that triiodothyronine increases the
accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression of
lipogenic enzyme in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. moreover, we
show that the tr isoform is predominantly expressed in
adipocytes, suggesting that tr seems to be involved in a
complex process of lipid accumulation in adipocytes.

1974). when 100 nm t3 were added to the 3t3-l1 cells
in the presence of adipogenic mixture, the numbers of
triglyceride droplets were significantly augmented at the
terminal phase. we tried to explain which tr isoform
mediates the action of thyroid hormone in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. there are several reports regarding the determination of the expression of tr isoforms using specific
antibodies or specific probes (strait et al. 1990, schwartz
et al. 1992). in the present study, we have employed a
simple and reliable method to determine the relative
amount of tr1 and tr1 transcripts in the cells. it has

been shown that both tr and tr are expressed in
ob17 preadipocytes, although there is a predominance of
tr (teboul et al. 1991, dace et al. 1999). in these
experiments, we have come to the same conclusion that
the tr subtype is the predominant tr transcript in
3t3-l1 adipocytes. because of its extremely low expression, the role of the tr isoform is less clear; however,
tr might maintain a basal responsiveness to thyroid
hormone in adipocytes (dace et al. 1999). furthermore,
we have shown that tr expression is increased at the
time of conversion from the intermediate to the late stage

of diﬀerentiation, which is coincident with the accumulation of lipid droplets, suggesting a prominent role of tr
isoform in the generation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype. compared with previous reports showing that t3 is an adipogenic factor necessary at an early
stage of diﬀerentiation in ob17 cells, we found that t3
alone could not promote the conversion from preadipocyte
to mature adipocyte (data not shown). these results
suggest that t3, by itself, is not an adipogenic hormone in
3t3-l1 cells, and that the role of t3 in adipocytes might
diﬀer between cell types.
to understand the role of trs in 3t3-l1 adipocytes,
mrna expression of the adipogenic factors was monitored. it is known that up-regulation of lipogenic enzymes
is required for lipid storage (dugail et al. 1992, briquetlaugier et al. 1994, ratledge 2001).  xxxg861xxx  is one of the
lipogenic enzymes involved in glycolysis, which is a major
metabolic pathway for providing lipogenic substrates
(barroso et al. 1999). our results showed that administration of t3 to the diﬀerentiating 3t3-l1 cells augmented the accumulation of lipid droplets and significantly
increased transcripts of  xxxg861xxx  and glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (data not shown). similar regulation of
malic enzyme in adipocytes was also documented in
previous studies (flores-delgado et al. 1987, lorenzo et al.
1988). collectively, we speculate that t3 enhances lipid
accumulation in 3t3-l1 adipocytes by inducing the
expression of these lipogenic enzymes. in the present
experiments, we could not elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby t3 could regulate the transcript of
 xxxg861xxx . there is an hypothesis based on the fact that the
promoter region of malic enzyme has response elements
for tr and is regulated by thyroid hormone (petty et al.
www.endocrinology.org

w jiang

and others

1990, desvergne et al. 1991), and a similar mechanism
might be involved in the regulation of  xxxg861xxx  by t3
(barroso et al. 1999).
by contrast, t3 does not aﬀect the expression of an early
transcription factor, c/ebp, which belongs to a family of
transcription factors containing a highly conserved basic/
leucine zipper (bzip) domain and has been implicated in
transcriptional control of cell growth and diﬀerentiation
(porse et al. 2001). this observation might be in conflict
with earlier investigations showing that c/ebp and
c/ebp are regulated by thyroid hormone in the rat liver
(menendez-hurtado et al. 2000). it is possible that hormonal control of c/ebp genes is regulated in a tissue- or
cell-specific manner. furthermore, thyroid hormone does
not alter the expression of ppar, which is considered to
be a potent adipogenic inducer, or of ap2, which is a
downstream factor under the control of ppar (gurnell
et al. 2000, tamori et al. 2002). these results are consistent
with the finding that t3 itself is not an adipogenic inducer.
the findings reported here, as well as recent studies
suggest that tr plays a pivotal role in mediating the
action of thyroid hormone in adipocytes. it is possible that
t3 increases lipid accumulation through regulating the
expression of lipogenic enzymes. however, the function of
trs in adipose tissue is not entirely clear, and the
preadipocyte line does not precisely reflect the in vivo
process. further investigations will be required to fully
elucidate the role of tr in adipocytes.
