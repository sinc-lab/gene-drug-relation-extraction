abstract. to examine the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency
on the  xxxg1601xxx , we examined the binding of [3h]
dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal subjects and patients
with adrenal insufficiency before and after glucocorticoid replacement therapy. using a whole cell competitive binding assay,
normal human lymphocytes had 5977 ± 1487 (mean ± sd)
binding sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 10 ± 2 nm.
lymphocytes from patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency
had fewer binding sites (3364 ± 322) and a 2-fold increase in

g

binding affinity (5.4 ± 0.9 nivt). the administration of conventional replacement doses of  xxxd1754xxx  for 6 months
caused no change in receptor number, but was associated with
a decrease in binding affinity toward normal. after long term
glucocorticoid replacement therapy, binding parameters were
similar to those in patients before treatment. the physiological
implications of the decreased receptor number and increased
binding affinity in adrenal insufficiency remain to be elucidated.

of glucocorticoid replacement. blood samples were drawn at
0800 h and 24 h after the last dose of medication in glucocorticoid-treated patients. fourteen healthy subjects of both sexes,
aged 23-50 yr, served as controls.
binding assays were performed using a major modification
of the method of lippman (1, 5). forty-five milliliters of peripheral blood were heparinized and separated over a ficollhypaque gradient (8). the mononuclear cell layer was removed
and suspended in eagle's minimal essential medium (mem)
supplemented with 600 mg/liter glutamine, 25 mm n-tris [hydroxymethyl]methyl glycine, and 10% fetal calf serum. this cell
suspension was incubated in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 c
for 45 min to remove monocytes (9). after this procedure,
differential cell counts of wright's stained smears showed less
than 2 monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes/100 nucleated cells, and less than 3% of the cells remaining after
adherence ingested latex particles. the lymphocytes were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), ph 7.2, and
resuspended in mem at a density of 4 x 106 cells/ml. five
hundred microliters of this suspension were added to 12 x 75ml glass tubes containing 50 jul [3h]dexamethasone and 50 \i\
unlabeled dexamethasone. the final concentration of [3h]dexamethasone was 1 nm, and the final concentration of unlabeled
dexamethasone ranged from 0.5-50 nm. the unlabeled steroids
were dissolved in ethanol, and the final ethanol concentration
was always less than 0.01%. a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled
steroid was used to determine the nonspecific binding. the
tubes were vortexed gently and incubated at 37 c for 6 h.
at the end of the incubation, 2 ml pbs at 4 c were added to
each tube, and the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000
x g in a beckman centrifuge (model j6, beckman instruments,
palo alto, ca). after washing with cold pbs twice, the cells
were suspended in 1 ml 95% ethanol and 0.5 ml pbs and
transferred to counting vials containing 10 ml scintillation fluid.

lucocorticoid receptors are present in many
tissues, including human lymphocytes. the binding characteristics of this receptor have been determined
previouly (1-4), and the ready availability of this tissue
makes it ideal for an examination of the glucocorticoid
receptor in disease states. we have recently demonstrated that the administration of glucocorticoids to normal subjects causes a decrease in the glucocorticoid
receptor concentration in peripheral lymphocytes (5),
but modulation of the  xxxg1601xxx  in states of
cortisol deficiency has not been described in man.
to determine the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on
the  xxxg1601xxx , we have examined the binding of [3h]dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal
subjects and patients with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency before and after glucocorticoid replacement
therapy.
subjects and methods
after obtaining informed consent, six patients with newly
diagnosed adrenal insufficiency were studied before treatment.
the diagnosis was confirmed by a 24-h urinary free cortisol
excretion less than 10 /xg/g creatinine, a blunted serum cortisol
response to a 3-day iv infusion of acth (6), or a serum 11deoxycortisol response of less than 8.5 jug/dl after the administration of a single dose of  xxxd2633xxx  (7) (table 1). we repeated
the binding studies in four patients at intervals after the start
received january 14, 1981.

radioactivity was counted in a packard tricarb liquid scintillation spectrometer (model 3375, packard, downers grove, il)
at approximately 50% efficiency. the number of binding sites
per cell and the dissociation constants were estimated from
computer-assisted analysis of the binding data according to the
method of scatchard (10). the best-fit line was computed by
least squares regression using the mean of duplicate samples
from multiple experiments. specific binding was calculated as
the difference between total and nonspecific binding. the statistical analysis used was student's t test.
we purchased [l,2-(a0-3h]dexamethasone (20ci/mmol)
from amersham (arlington heights, il); ficol (type 400), unlabeled testosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, dexamethasone,
and hydrocortisone from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo);
fetal calf serum and eagle's mem from grand island biological
supply co. (grand island, ny); sodium diatrizoate from winthrop laboratories (new york, ny); and universal high counting efficiency liquid scintillation fluid from baker chemical co.
(phillipsburg, nj).

results
the binding of [3h]dexamethasone to lymphocytes
from healthy subjects was time and temperature dependent (fig. 1). at 37 c, steady state binding was achieved
at 6 h and was stable for up to 12 h. cell viability
exceeded 95% at the end of the incubation, as determined
by trypan blue exclusion. binding was maximal at ph 7.2
and rapidly reversible upon the addition of a 1000-fold

excess of unlabeled hormone (fig. 2). under these assay
conditions, the specific binding of [3h]dexamethasone
was linear with respect to cell number (fig. 1). a comparison of the relative binding affinities of various steroids for the lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  revealed
that dexamethasone and hydrocortisone competed more
effectively for the receptor than did 11-deoxycorticosterone or testosterone (fig. 2). the  xxxg1601xxx 
in lymphocytes from patients with untreated adrenal
insufficiency demonstrated the same time and temperature dependence and the same rapid reversibility as that
in lymphocytes from normal subjects.
figure 3 shows a typical competiton curve at 37 c for
the binding of [3h]dexamethasone to lymphocytes. scatchard analysis of the binding revealed a linear plot consistent with a single class of receptors of uniform binding
affinity. at 37 c, normal human lymphocytes had 5977
± 1487 (mean ± sd) binding sites/cell and an equilibrium
dissociation constant of 10 ± 2 nm. lymphocytes from
patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency had significantly fewer binding sites per cell (3364 ± 322; p < 0.005,
by t test) and a 2-fold increase in binding affinity (5.4 ±
0.9 nm; p < 0.005, by t test; fig. 4 and 5). binding
parameters in lymphocytes from patients with primary
adrenal insufficiency were not different from those in

patients whose adrenal insufficiency was secondary to
acth deficiency (table 1).
we examined the effects of glucocorticoid replacement
therapy in four patients at varying intervals after the
administration of  xxxd1754xxx . the administration
of doses of  xxxd1754xxx  ranging from 12.5-37.5 mg
daily for 2 weeks to 6 months caused no change in
receptor concentration. after 2 months of replacement
therapy, the binding affinity appeared to return toward
normal (fig. 5).
to determine if these changes were also present after
long term glucocorticoid therapy, we studied two additional patients whose primary adrenal insufficiency was
treated with 37.5 mg  xxxd1754xxx  daily for over 2 yr.
lymphocytes from these individuals showed the same
decreased receptor concentration (2475 ± 319 sites/cell)
and high binding affinity (3.9 ± 0.1 nm) seen in the
untreated subjects.

characterized and quantified in human lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. the linear scatchard plots
and dissociation constants determined for the binding of
[3h]dexamethasone to lymphocytes correspond closely
to those reported in previous studies using human white
blood cells (1-5). in addition, we have shown that patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency have decreased  xxxg1601xxx  concentrations and increased binding affinity.
these findings contrast with animal studies, which
demonstrated an increase in hepatic cytosol  xxxg1601xxx  concentrations without a change in binding
affinity 2-3 days after adrenalectomy (11, 12). in a study
using human mononuclear cells, kontula et dl. (13) reported no change in the  xxxg1601xxx  concentration in three patients with adrenal insufficiency. however, this study was done with a nonuniform population
of white cells, which could have obscured a change in

receptor concentration. more importantly, the study was
done with a single concentration of [3h]dexamethasone
rather than a complete saturation analysis. these conditions allow only an estimate of the number of receptor
sites and cannot be used to determine changes in binding
affinity.
there are several possible explanations for the decreased receptor concentration and increased binding
affinity in patients with adrenal insufficiency. it is possible that cortisol deficiency is associated with a change
in lymphocyte subpopulations. all human lymphocytes
possess glucocorticoid receptors (14-16), but the binding
of [3h]dexamethasone differs in various subclasses. human t and b lymphocytes have similar binding characteristics, while monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes have higher receptor concentrations (2, 15). our
experimental method ensures that only lymphocytes are
used for receptor determinations but does not distinguish
between t and b lymphocytes. however, since differences in receptor number and binding affinity in b cells,
t cells, and t cell subtypes are negligible (2, 17), it is
unlikely that small changes in a subpopulation of lymphocytes account for the difference in the number of
binding sites and receptor affinity in patients with glucocorticoid deficiency.
the presence of endogenous steroids could also explain
the difference in binding parameters between normal
lymphocytes and those in patients with adrenal insufficiency. normal lymphocytes would demonstrate lower
binding affinity if endogenous hormone were not adequately removed. however, at 37 c, the dissociation of
specifically bound dexamethasone from receptor sites is
rapid and complete after 30 min. this rapid dissociation
and the prolonged incubation time allow adequate time
for free exchange of the ligand with receptor sites and
make it unlikely that reversible receptor occupancy is
responsible for the decrease in affinity seen in normal
cells. furthermore, if the glucocorticoid was irreversibly
bound to the receptor, the presence of endogenous cortisol would cause a decreased receptor concentration in
normal individuals.
it is also possible that results using a whole cell assay
may reflect a different population of receptor sites than
does a cytoplasmic assay. there is evidence from both
human and animal studies that the binding properties of
cytoplasmic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors are different. at physiological temperature, the binding of [3h]
dexamethasone to intact human lymphocytes and rat
thymocytes is primarily to nuclear receptors (18,19). the
decreased receptor concentration in patients with adrenal insufficiency may therefore reflect a decrease in the
number of nuclear binding sites. this is consistent with
the finding of beato et al. (20), who observed a marked
decrease in hepatic nuclear receptor sites in adrenalec-

tomized rats. it will be necessary to confirm the findings
in human adrenal disease by studying the distribution of
nuclear and cytoplasmic binding sites in lymphocytes.
it is unclear why the  xxxg1601xxx  concentration does not normalize after conventional glucocorticoid treatment of adrenal insufficiency. in preparations
of liver nuclei, beato et al. (20) demonstrated that the
administration of cortisol to adrenalectomized rats was
associated with a return to the normal glucocorticoid
receptor number. in this in vivo system, it is possible
that factors other than changes in circulating glucocorticoid concentration are required to modulate receptor
number and binding affinity, or that the dose and time of
administration of  xxxd1754xxx  are insufficient to
cause a sustained plasma level of glucocorticoid.
