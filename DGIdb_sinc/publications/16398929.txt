abstract
background: the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors have complicated and poorly
characterized pharmacokinetics. there are two binding sites per ace (high affinity "c", lower
affinity "n") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. most inhibitors are
given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. this paper
describes the first human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model of this drug class.
methods: the model was applied to the experimental data of van griensven et. al for the
pharmacokinetics of ramiprilat and its prodrug ramipril. it describes the time course of the
inhibition of the n and c ace sites in plasma and the different tissues. the model includes: 1) two
independent ace binding sites; 2) non-equilibrium time dependent binding; 3) liver and kidney
ramipril intracellular uptake, conversion to ramiprilat and extrusion from the cell; 4) intestinal
ramipril absorption. the experimental in vitro ramiprilat/ace binding kinetics at 4°c and 300 mm
nacl were assumed for most of the pbpk calculations. the model was incorporated into the freely
distributed pbpk program pkquest.
results: the pbpk model provides an accurate description of the individual variation of the plasma
ramipril and ramiprilat and the ramiprilat renal clearance following iv ramiprilat and iv and oral
ramipril. summary of model features: less than 2% of total body ace is in plasma; 35% of the oral
dose is absorbed; 75% of the ramipril metabolism is hepatic and 25% of this is converted to systemic
ramiprilat; 100% of renal ramipril metabolism is converted to systemic ramiprilat. the inhibition
was long lasting, with 80% of the c site and 33% of the n site inhibited 24 hours following a 2.5 mg
oral ramipril dose. the plasma ace inhibition determined by the standard assay is significantly less
than the true in vivo inhibition because of assay dilution.
conclusion: if the in vitro plasma binding kinetics of the ace inhibitor for the two binding sites
are known, a unique pbpk model description of the griensven et. al. experimental data can be
obtained.

background
the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors are
one of the worst characterized drug classes in terms of
their quantitative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. there are a number of factors that complicate the
analysis of this drug class:
1) the ace enzyme in plasma and tissue has a very high
affinity (sub nanomolar) for the ace inhibitors. this produces extremely non-linear kinetics as the concentration
falls from high concentrations when most of the drug is
free, to low concentrations when most of the drug is
bound to ace.
2) although it is known that more than 90% of the total
ace is in the tissues, the quantitative distribution of tissue
ace is not well characterized.
3) although it is known that ace has two sites with different inhibitor binding constants, the physiological values
of these binding constants are not known.
4) the two ace binding sites have different catalytic substrate selectivity. predicting the pharmacodynamics of the
ace inhibitors requires knowledge of these substrate
activities.
5) the rate of dissociation of the inhibitor from ace is so
slow (hours) that one cannot assume that there is instantaneous equilibrium between the free and bound inhibitor.
6) assays of the ace inhibition are unreliable because of
uncertainties about the relationship between the in vivo
inhibition and the inhibition measured in the standard
ace assay.
7) most ace inhibitors are administered orally in the
form of a prodrug that is systemically converted to the
active inhibitor. prediction of the pharmacokinetics of the
active form requires an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug and drug and the details of the conversion of the prodrug to the active form in the liver and
kidney.
this paper presents the first attempt to describe a quantitative human physiologically based pharmacokinetic
model (pbpk) of the ace inhibitors. the model describes
the pharmacokinetics in terms of realistic human parameters such as the organ blood flows, tissue cellular and
extracellular volume and cell membrane permeability.
the model incorporates all of the complexities listed
above. it is implemented in pkquest, a general pharmacokinetic software routine that has now been applied to
more than 25 different solutes with a wide range of phar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/6/1

macokinetic properties [1-8]. many of the physiological
parameters of the model have been determined previously
by application of pkquest to other drugs and are used
directly without modification in this ace inhibitor
model. this includes the tissue blood flows, extracellular
volume of distribution of the different tissues, and the tissue albumin concentration (which is important because
of non-specific ace inhibitor albumin binding).
although it is now generally recognized that rational drug
therapy should be based on the quantitative degree on tissue ace inhibition [9], the dependence of the pharmacodynamic effect on plasma drug levels and ace activity is
still not clear [10-12]. huge efforts have been directed at
determining optimum dosage with limited results [13]. it
will be shown that this pbpk model has the potential to
provide direct quantitative information about the time
and dose dependence of the ace inhibition in the different tissues.
it has been known for many years that inhibitor binding
to ace was of the "slow tight" class, with dissociation
constants in the sub-nanomolar range, and time constants
for release from the tight complex of many hours. because
of the non-linear binding curves, it was initially assumed
that the binding of the inhibitor (r) to the free enzyme
(e) was a two step process:

r + e ↔ rel r ret

(1 )

with rapid formation of a loose complex (rel) followed
by a slow conversion to the tight form (ret) [14-18].
when it was recognized that ace had two homologous
extracellular binding sites (referred to as the "n" and "c"
terminal sites), it became apparent that the non-linearity
resulted from the presence of these two sites and that the
kinetics of each site could be described as a one step process characterized by two equilibrium dissociation constants kn and kc (nm) and unbinding rate constants k-n
and k-c (1/min) [19]:
k

n

k c = k−c / kc
k n = k− n / kn

(2)

there is conflicting data about the interaction between the
two sites (see [20] for recent discussion). in the most
detailed experimental measurements of the ace binding
kinetics, wei et. al. [19] found that the two sites acted
independently in the binding of [3h]trandolaprilat. it is
assumed here that the n and c site binding of ramiprilat
is also independent.

of the

of prodrug ramipril (r)
pbpk model of the pharmacokinetics of prodrug ramipril (r)
and active drug ramiprilat (d). the figure schematically illustrates the events in three different tissues (typical "tissue",
the liver and the kidney), the intestinal absorption, the renal
clearance and enterohepatic recirculation.

the only quantitative kinetic measurements of ki and k-i
for ramiprilat binding to the two sites is at 4°c and 300
mm nacl [21]. measurements of the rate of substrate
hydrolysis indicates that, in going from 25°c and 300
mm cl- to 37°c and 120 mm cl-, the change in apparent
ki of ramiprilat is small because the temperature and chloride change tend to cancel each other [22]. in the following analysis, as a first approximation, it will be assumed
that the physiological (37°c and 100 mm cl) binding
constants for the two sites (eq. (2)) are equal to the experimental values at 4°c and 300 mm nacl.
although there have been some reports of different binding properties of plasma and tissue ace [23-27], the differences are small and could be an artifact of the difficulty
of assaying these very high affinity ("tight") enzymes (see
below). since it has been established that the circulating
ace in the plasma is derived from the membrane bound
tissue ace by post-translational proteolytic cleavage
[28,29], it will be assumed, as a first approximation, that
the circulating and tissue ace are identical. (a major
exception is testis ace which contains only the c terminal
domain binding site [21].) this is an important consideration because it allows one to use measurements of the
fraction of the circulating plasma ace that is occupied by

bound inhibitor to determine the ace inhibition in the
different tissues – the clinically important factor.
previous attempts to model the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of the ace inhibitors have used compartmental models and were not physiologically based
(i.e., using known organ blood flows, etc.) [30-34].
toutain and colleagues have developed detailed compartment models and used them to accurately describe the
non-linear pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of a
number of high affinity ace inhibitors in animals [3032]. the most important previous modeling of ramiprilat
in humans is that of brockmeier [35,36] who recognized
that the renal clearance of ramiprilat provided a direct
measurement of the fraction that was free in plasma and
used this measurement to estimate the physiological ramiprilat ace binding constant. all of these earlier models
have been limited by the assumption of a single ace
binding site and equilibrium binding and they have not
attempted to model the processes involved in the conversion of the prodrug to the drug.
the pbpk model that is applied here to the ace inhibitors
is summarized in fig. 1. it has two features that are implemented for the first time in a pbpk model. the first is the
use of a time dependent binding (eq. (2)) in each of the
tissues, in place of the usual assumption of equilibrium
binding. the second is the physiological model of the cellular uptake and intracellular conversion of ramipril to
ramiprilat and the subsequent extrusion to the circulating
blood. these features have been implemented in the
freely distributed software program pkquest [37].
the model is applied to the detailed pharmacokinetic
analysis of ramipril (prodrug) and ramiprilat (the active
 xxxd2537xxx  ace inhibitor) previously described by
van griensven et. al[38]. this is an open, randomized,
three-way cross-over study that measured: 1) the plasma
ramiprilat following an intravenous (iv) ramiprilat infusion; 2) plasma ramipril and ramiprilat following an iv
ramipril infusion; and 3) plasma ramipril and ramiprilat
after oral ramipril. in addition, plasma ace activity and
the urinary excretion of ramipril, ramiprilat and the major
metabolites were measured in all 3 arms. the requirement
that a single pbpk model must be able to describe all these
data sets places strong constraints on the model and
severely limits the range of the allowed model parameters.

the pbpk model
this section describes the main features of the model. see
additional file ace_supplemental_31oct05.doc (section
i) for a detailed mathematical description. the arrangement of the different tissues is shown in fig. 2. the tissue
parameters (blood flow, volumes, etc.) are listed in table
1 and are identical to those used in previous applications
of pkquest [1-8]. the connective tissue is divided
between two organs: "tendon" with a relatively low blood
flow, and "other" with a higher blood flow. the "standard" organ blood flows are assumed and the small
changes in peripheral blood flow produced by ramipril
[39] are neglected. ace inhibitors do not produce a significant change in cardiac output [40].

figure 1 shows a more detailed view of the model that
focuses on 3 tissues: the liver, kidney, and one representative "tissue" region. "d" is the free prodrug (ramipril)
concentration, and "r" is the free active drug (ramiprilat)
concentration. the top square, labeled "tissue" shows the
kinetic processes in a typical tissue region. both the highly
water soluble ramiprilat (r) and the tissue ace binding
sites are restricted to the extracellular space (ec). (exceptions are the liver and kidney which have ramiprilat cell
membrane transport systems.) the fraction of tissue volume that is extracellular has been determined previously
[6]. as described in eq. 2, it is assumed that ace has two
non-interacting binding sites (labeled as "c" and "n" terminal) with different ramiprilat binding constants
[19,21] (only one binding site is shown in fig. 1). the
binding for each site is characterized by the two parameters: k-i the unbinding rate constant; and ki the dissociation equilibrium constant (ki = k-i/ki). the amount bound
is described quantitatively by the differential equations:

d(rec )
= kc r ec − k−c rec
dt

d(ren )
= kn r en − k− n ren

there is also a non-specific, non-saturating equilibrium

as
describe
in
the
additional
file
1
ace_supplemental_31oct05.doc (section i), the amount
of albumin binding in the different tissues can be determined from the experimental value for the fraction of
albumin bound ramiprilat in plasma (= 0.56 [41]) and
the previously determined "standard human" pkquest
values for the tissue extracellular albumin [6]. this supplemental file section also describes in more detail how
the above relations for ramiprilat are incorporated into
the pkquest pbpk routine.
the pbpk analysis indicates that ramipril has a finite cell
membrane permeability that allows it to enter the intracellular space (ic) (see fig. 1, "tissue"). this is consistent
with the relatively high octanol/water partition coefficient
at ph 7 of 1.12 of ramipril, one hundred fold greater than
that of ramiprilat (0.011) [42]. the rate of exchange
between the intracellular and extracellular space is determined by two parameters: 1) the cell membrane permeability coefficient (ps); and 2) the fraction of intracellular
solute that is unbound (fu_cell):

tral venous and arterial compartment (binding not shown
in fig. 1). each tissue i is characterized by 3 parameters: 1)
total ace concentration (acei) with two sites per each
ace molecule (etci = etni = acei); 2) ramipril cell membrane permeability coefficient (psi) and 3) intracellular
ramipril binding (fu_cell). in addition, the ramiprilat liver
and kidney ps and fu_cell must be defined. the ramiprilat
ace binding constants (kn, kc, k-n, k-c) are assumed to be
identical for all tissues.
both the liver and kidney metabolize the intracellular
ramipril (d'). as shown in fig. 1, the liver metabolizes
ramipril to ramiprilat (r') and to a number of other
metabolites (indicated by m). three parameters characterize this metabolism: the intrinsic liver (clint_l) and kidney
(clint_k) clearance and the fraction of total liver ramipril
metabolism that is converted to ramiprilat (frl). (1- frl is
converted to other metabolites). it is assume that all the
ramipril metabolized by the kidney is converted to ramiprilat. the rate that the liver converts intracellular ramipril
(free concentration = d') to intracellular ramiprilat (r') is:
qr = clint_lfrl d'

d(d ’)
= fu _ cell ps(d − d ’) ps = ps / vw
dt

( 5)

where d and d' are the free extracellular and intracellular
ramipril concentration and ps is the cellular permeability
coefficient (p = permeability, s = surface area, and vw =
intracellular water volume). extracellular ramipril is also
bound to albumin, similar to the binding of ramiprilat
(eq. (4)).

(6)

all the intracellular ramiprilat generated by the liver and
kidney eventually enters the systemic circulation (see eq.
(5)). the intrinsic clearance is in terms of the free concentration. for a flow limited, well stirred tissue, the absolute
clearance (cl) can be approximately related to the intrinsic clearance (clint) in terms of the organ flow (f), and
fraction unbound (fu):
cl = fu clint f/(f + fu clint)

the ramiprilat and ramipril kinetics discussed above and
illustrated in fig. 1 for the box labeled "tissue" is present
in all the tissues, including the liver and kidney and cen-

(7)

as illustrated in fig. 1, the extracellular ramiprilat is not
metabolized or excreted by the liver. the only excretory

pathway removing ramiprilat is the renal excretion (qkidney) which is assumed to be proportional to the free,
unbound, arterial ramiprilat concentration (rart):
qkidney = clu rart

(8)

where clu is the unbound renal clearance. the unbound
concentration is related to the total arterial plasma concentration (rt_art) by the fraction unbound in arterial
plasma (fu):
qkidney = clu rart = clu furt_art = clrrt_art

clr = fuclu

(9)

where clr is the renal total plasma clearance. because of
the highly non-linear ramiprilat binding that results from
saturation of the ace binding sites, the total renal clearance (clr) is non-linear: at high concentrations when
most of the ramiprilat is free (fuo 1), the clearance is
equal to the intrinsic unbound clearance (clr | clu | 0.4
l/min), while at long times and low concentrations, when
most of the ramiprilat is bound, the clearance falls to values less than 0.02 l/min [35,36].
the observed delay in the systemic appearance of ramiprilat after either an oral or iv ramipril input depends on the
processes involved in the liver and kidney ramipril cellular uptake, intracellular conversion to ramiprilat and then
transport to the plasma. these processes have been
directly identified in an extensive series of investigations
of pang and colleagues on the behavior of enalapril and

enalaprilat in perfused rat liver, kidney and intestine [4349].
although there was an initial report that the intestinal
absorption was carrier mediated [50], morrison et. al. [51]
have clearly shown that the absorption of enalapril is primarily a non-saturable, passive diffusion process. there
are three different components for absorption of oral ramipril (fig. 1). the major component is direct absorption of
ramipril into the portal circulation where it is subject to
first pass metabolism. this component is described by the
3 parameter gamma distribution (ad, t, a):
i(t) = adbata-1 exp(-bt)/*(a)

b = a/t

(10)

where ad is the total amount absorbed, * is the gamma
function, a is the dimensionless gamma number and t is
a time constant. for most drugs this 3 parameter function
provides a good description of the time delay in oral
absorption produced by gastric emptying [5]. the three
parameters ad, a and t are adjusted for each subject. pang
et. al. [48] have shown in the rat that there is a second
component in which some of the oral ramipril can be
directly converted to ramiprilat either in the lumen or the
intestinal epithelial cells and absorbed into the portal
blood. this second component produces a more rapid
systemic appearance of ramiprilat than the first component because it bypasses the slower processes involved in
the liver and renal production of ramiprilat from ramipril.
it is assumed that this ramiprilat absorption has the same

time course as the major ramipril component (eq. (10))
with the same values of a and t and a value of a (= ar)
about 10% that of ad. finally, in some subjects it was necessary to add a second, much slower rate of ramipril
absorption that was described by a constant rate that
extended from 200 to 3000 minutes:

( 11 )

where aslow is the total amount absorbed by this component. in summary, the oral absorption is characterized by
5 parameters: ad, ar, aslow, a and t (see table 4).
all of these features were incorporated into pkquest and
can be activated using a simple interactive menu. the
parameters describing the individual pbpk models of
each of the two solutes (ramipril and ramiprilat) are
entered first. the two solutes are then coupled by defining
the parameters vmax [i,j,m] and km [i,j,m] which are the
michaelis-menten parameters for metabolism of substrate
i to product j in tissue m. it is assumed that the ramipril
metabolism is liner, so that km is set to a very large value
and vmax is set equal to kmclint. an arbitrary number of
substrates and products are allowed. most of the figures
used in this paper represent standard pkquest output.
model parameters
the pbpk model is characterized by a large number of
parameters. most of these parameters are fixed and are
identical for all subjects (see table 1). in addition there
are 12 parameters that are adjusted (see below) to fit the
data for each subject: 4 characterizing the ramiprilat phar-

macokinetics (table 2); 3 characterizing the ramipril
metabolism (table 3); and 5 characterizing the ramipril
intestinal absorption (table 4). a brief description of
these parameters is listed here:
ramiprilat ace binding kinetics
the values determined by deddish et. al. [21] at 4°c and
300 mm nacl were used as the default "standard" values
for all subjects (see eq. (2)): n site (low affinity): kn = .276
nm; k-n = 0.0234/min; c site (high affinity): kc = 0.039
nm; k-c = 0.00168/min.
plasma and tissue ace concentration
the ace concentration in normal human plasma determined using a radioimmunoassay varies from 220 to 730
ng/ml [29,52]. (a single genetic polymorphism accounts
for 50% of this normal variation). this corresponds to
1.29 to 4.29 nm, assuming a molecular weight of circulating ace of 170 kda [53]. the plasma ace (aceplasma) in
the pbpk model is a variable parameter, adjusted to optimize the fit to the experimental data. the model values
varied from 1.13 to 2.9 nm for the different subject (table
2). this is the lower end of the experimental range for
humans. the tissue ace is defined by a standard tissue/
plasma ratio (listed in table 1) and is identical for all subjects. the lung, liver, heart, brain and gi tract ratios are in
rough agreement with experimental measurements in rats
or rabbits [23,54-56]. the skeletal muscle values are based
on needle biopsy measurements in humans [57,58].
although there are high ace concentrations in the kidney, most of this activity is in the lumen of the proximal
tubule [59], a region that will have limited and slow contact with the circulating ace inhibitor [56]. the total tissue ace is 68 times the blood ace. an essential

qualitative feature of the pbpk modeling is the requirement for this large total ace tissue/blood ratio (see
results). high ace concentrations have been assigned to
the loose connective tissue organs ("tendon" and "other")
and to "adipose" tissue based on the observation of sun
et. al. [60] that there was high ace concentration in subcutaneous connective tissue. especially important is the
high adipose tissue/plasma value of 6.8 because adipose
tissue makes a large contribution to the pharmacokinetics
because of it large weight (table 1). although there is no
quantitative adipose date in humans, it has been shown
that ace mrna is expressed in human adipose tissue
[61]. in rats, the subcutaneous fat/plasma ramiprilat binding ratio at 24 hours after an oral dose was about 5 [41].

values listed in table 1 were assigned to provide optimal
fits to the iv ramipril input.

ramiprilat renal clearance
the intrinsic renal clearance (clu, eq. (9)) was adjusted to
fit the data for each subject (table 2).

ace assay
it is well recognized that the standard ace plasma assay
in the presence of inhibitors may give a result that differs
significantly from the in vivo plasma activity [35,62,63].
the problem arises from the dilution and time dependent
effects that become important for the very tight and slow
ace binding. in order to compare the experimental
plasma assay measurements with the pbpk model predictions of the fraction of plasma ace that is complexed with
inhibitor, it is necessary to develop a detailed kinetic
model of the assay procedure. the following analysis is
similar to that of weisser and schloos [63], except that
they assumed rapid, equilibrium binding, while this analysis use the more general time dependent binding model
(eq. (3)).

ramiprilat liver and kidney cell membrane permeability and
intracellular binding
the product of the two parameters fu_cell and ps determines the rate that the intracellular ramiprilat formed
from ramipril enters the systemic circulation (eq. (5)).
the value of fu_cell for the kidney and liver were assigned
arbitrary large values, corresponding to a low binding
(table 1) and the values of ps were adjusted for each subject (table 2) to fit the experimental data.
ramipril liver cell membrane permeability and intracellular binding
the ramipril ps is finite for all tissues, allowing ramipril to
distribute in all the body water. the value of fu_cell determines the equilibrium volume of distribution and ps
determines the time course of this equilibrium. the fixed

ramipril metabolic parameters
the intrinsic liver (clint_l) and kidney (clint_k) clearance
and the fraction of the liver clearance that is converted to
ramiprilat (frl) were adjusted for each subject to fit the
oral and iv ramipril data (table 3).
ramipril intestinal absorption parameters
the values of the 5 parameters describing the intestinal
ramipril absorption (ad, a, t, ar, aslow, eqs. (10) and
(11)) were adjusted to fit the individual subject data
(table 4).

the ace assay of the ramipril study used the vertex kit
ace assay [17] in which a 10 fold dilution of plasma is
incubated with 8 mm of the substrate p- [3h]benzoylgly-

where ec, en and eti are the free c and n site and total
enzyme concentration, s is the free concentration of assay
substrate and i, iec and ien are the free inhibiter (e.g. ramiprilat) and the inhibitor ace complex concentration. it is
assumed that the substrate concentration (s) is much
greater than et or it and, therefore, s is a constant, equal
to the fixed assay concentration. the reported ace equilibrium dissociation constant (ks) for this substrate is 5
mm [17]. this represents the average for the two sites and,
since the individual values for each site are not known, it
has been assumed that each site has a ks of 5 mm.
the true "in vivo" enzyme activity is proportional to the
fraction of ace that is not complexed with inhibitor. this
differs from the measured assay activity because the dilution associated with the assay results in a time dependent
dissociation of inhibitor during the 60 minute assay. the
experimental assay activity (= assay60) is defined as the
ratio of the amount of substrate that is hydrolyzed in 60
minutes by the plasma sample in the presence of ace

inhibitor relative to the activity in the same subject when
no inhibitor is present (before inhibitor administered).
this ratio is the weighted average of the individual catalytic activity of the two sites. in the analysis used here it is
assumed that the two sites are independent and what is
plotted in the results is the relative activity of each site
which is described by:

the concentration of the inhibitor-enzyme complex
(iex(t)) decreases during the 60 minute incubation as
inhibitor dissociates because of dilution and competition
with substrate. the value of iex(t)) is determined from a
solution of a differential equation obtained from eq. (12).

experimental data
the pbpk model was fitted to the results described previously by van griensven et. al. [38] of a 3 way crossover
trial using 12 healthy young (19 to 28 years), non-obese
(average weight = 76.25 kg and height = 1.86, bmi 19.9 to
24) males [38]. only 11 subjects were used in the analysis
because there was no oral data for subject 2. the three
arms of the study were: 1) 2.5 mg oral ramipril; 2) approximately 2.5 mg (range 2.59 – 2.97) iv ramipril given as a
constant 1 min infusion; and 3) approximately 2.5 mg
(range 2.59 – 3.19) iv ramiprilat given as a 1 min infusion.

the value of the antecubital vein plasma ramipril and
ramiprilat and the serum ace activity (ventrix kit) was
determined at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes and 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 72 hours. it is assumed that
the antecubital vein concentration can be approximated
by the central vein concentration. the urine concentration
of ramipril, ramiprilat and the major metabolites was
determined at varying times out to 72 hours. the plasma
ramiprilat was determined by a 125i-radioimmunoassay
using rabbit antibodies to ramiprilat. the plasma ramipril
was determined by measuring the difference between the
ramiprilat concentration before and after enzymatic
hydrolysis of the ramipril to ramiprilat. this procedure
could lead to relatively large errors in the ramipril measurements in the presence of high ramiprilat concentrations and is, presumably, the explanation for the large
fluctuations in the plasma ramipril concentrations at long
times (see below). the reported detection limits were 1
ng/ml (2.4 nm) for ramipril and 0.5 ng/ml (1.3 nm) for
ramiprilat [64].
the selection of the parameters was based entirely on simple trial and error and subjective adjusting of parameters.

the current version of pkquest does not allow automated
fitting when more then one data set is used. (in this application, parameters must be optimized to fit 4 different
data sets: iv ramiprilat, iv ramipril, oral ramipril and
urine ramiprilat.) in addition, the fitting is complicated
by choices of how to weight the data. because of the large
fluctuations in plasma ramipril, less weight was given to
the model predictions at low ramipril concentration. the
individual model predictions for each subject and each
data set is shown in the results section. this is the best
qualitative measure of the model. in addition, the "average weighted residual error" is tabulated for each individual data set (tables 2, 3, 4):
n

wre = (1 / n)∑ experimentali − modeli / modeli
i =1

( 14 )

given the number of adjustable parameters and the complexity of the experimental data, this subjective aspect of
the model fitting cannot be avoided. several subjects had
a bimodal ramiprilat concentration curve following iv
ramipril with a sharp peak at 5 or 10 minutes that is not
predicted by the model and may be a result of hydrolysis
occurring in the hand and arm tissues drained by the
antecubital vein. these points were not included in the
calculated weighted error. as demonstrated by the parameter variation studies described in the results, some
parameters are highly constrained, while others have wide
ranges of possible values. the major emphasis of this
analysis is on the potential of the pbpk approach to determine the time and dosage dependence of the ace inhibition, not on the quantitative value of the parameters.

results
iv ramiprilat infusion
of the 3 sets of data that were modeled, the iv ramiprilat
is the simplest because the ramiprilat systemic input is
known and there is no ramipril present. the ramiprilat
pbpk parameters are: 1) the 4 ace binding constants (kn,
kc, k-n, k-c, eq. (2)); 2) the renal intrinsic clearance (clu,
eq. (9)) and 3) the total ace concentration in plasma and
each tissue (eti, 1 = 1..12). (the ace albumin binding (eq.
(4)) was determined directly from experimental measurements). only two of these parameters (clu and etplasma)
are varied to optimize the fit for each subject. the other
parameters were fixed at their "standard values" (see
methods). other pbpk parameters, such as tissue volume
and blood flow, extracellular water, tissue albumin, etc.
are taken from the default "standard human" data set that
was determined previously by application of pkquest to
other solutes.

the confidence limits of values of these model parameters
were determined by an analysis of the sensitivity of the
model predictions to variations in the parameters. a sum-

mary of this analysis is described here. (see the additional
file 1 ace_supplemental_31oct05.doc section iii for a
detailed sensitivity analysis). the values of the renal clearance (clu), the plasma ace and the total tissue ace are
uniquely determined (to within about ± 30%) by the
experimental data. as brockmeier [35,36] emphasized,
the renal clearance of ramiprilat provides a direct measurement of the fraction that is free in plasma and the
experimental urine ramiprilat excretion data has a crucial
role in the assignment of a unique set of parameters. the
model results are relatively insensitive to the distribution
of the total ace among the different tissues. the values of
the ramiprilat binding constants (kn, kc, k-n, k-c) cannot
be uniquely determined by the experimental data and
only qualitative constraints can be placed on them. values
of k-n and k-c varying from 10% of the standard value, up
to infinity provide similar fits. only the average value of
kn and kc can be uniquely assigned. for example, an identical kn = kc = 0.140 nm for both sites (equivalent to the
single binding site assumption of brockmeier [35,36])
provides as good a fit to the data as the "standard" model
(kn = .276, kc = 0.039 nm).
figure 3 shows the relationship between the plasma concentration (black) and the fraction of the n and c sites
that are occupied by ramiprilat (red) for subject 4. the
plasma ace for subject 4 is 1.65 nm, so that the total
binding site concentration is 3.3 nm. at early times (< 400
minutes), most of the ramiprilat is free, both sites are
nearly 100% occupied, and the plasma ace is determined
by the renal clearance (clu) and is independent of the ace
concentration and binding kinetics. at long times most of
the ramiprilat is bound and the plasma concentration is
determined primarily by the ace concentration and binding kinetics. at 72 hours, the total plasma ace equals 1.68
nm, the c site is 70% occupied, the n site is 24% occupied
and 95% of the ramiprilat is bound to ace.
figures 4 and 5 show the model fits for the iv ramiprilat
input data for each of the 11 subjects. two parameters
were adjusted for each subject – the renal clearance (clu)
and the plasma ace concentration. the values of these
two parameters and the weighted average error (eq. (14))
are listed in table 2. the ramiprilat binding constants and
the ace tissue/plasma ratio are identical for all subjects.
the agreement between the pbpk model predictions and
the experimental data is quite good, with an average error
of 18%.

culation while the ramiprilat appearance is significantly
delayed. this delay results from the intracellular accumulation and slow release of the ramiprilat produced from
ramipril in the liver and kidney (fig. 1). there are large
fluctuations in the plasma ramipril curve at long time and
low concentrations that cannot be attributed to enterohepatic recirculation since it would require impossibly large
and rapid rates of secretion and reabsorption. it is
assumed that this fluctuation is an artifact of the analytical
ramipril methodology discussed in the methods. seven
parameters are required to model the iv ramipril experiments (see methods): clint_l, clint_k and frl describe the
liver and kidney metabolism of ramipril and its conversion to ramiprilat; psl and psk describe the rate that this
ramiprilat leaves the liver and kidney and enters the systemic circulation; pst describes the rate that ramipril
enters the intracellular water of the peripheral tissues and
fu_cell describes the intracellular fraction unbound which
determines the ramipril equilibrium volume of distribution. figure 7 shows the plasma ramipril and ramiprilat
following an oral dose of 2.5 mg ramipril in the same subject. five additional parameters (ad, a, t, ar, aslow) are
required to model the oral ramipril intestinal absorption.
in total, 12 new parameters are required to describe the
oral and iv ramipril data. although it is not possible to
specify a unique, quantitative parameter set, an analysis of
the sensitivity of the model fits to variation in the parameters indicates that all of these parameters make significant contributions to the quality of the model fit. this
sensitivity analysis is summarized here. (see the additional file 1 ace_supplemental_31oct05.doc section iv
for a detailed analysis).
the 3 metabolic parameters (clint_l, clint_k frl) are
required to describe conversion of ramipril to systemic
ramiprilat in the kidney and liver. the requirement for
these two organ components arises from the different way
the liver and kidney act on an iv (no first pass metabolism) versus an oral input (with first pass metabolism). a
significantly poorer fit is obtained if only liver metabolism is included in the model. the parameters psl and psk
characterize the rate that the intracellular ramiprilat produced from ramipril enters the systemic circulation from
the liver and kidney. they are adjusted to fit the delayed
systemic appearance of ramiprilat following iv or oral
ramipril and are determined within factors of about 30%
by the experimental data. the sensitivity analysis indicates
that a finite peripheral tissue cell membrane ramipril permeability (pst), which allows the ramipril to distribute in
all the body water, clearly provides a better fit then
restricting the ramipril to the extracellular space. any permeability value ranging from the standard value up to
infinity provides an equally good fit.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/6/1

five parameters are required to describe the intestinal
absorption of oral ramipril. the major component is
described by the 3 parameter (a, a and t) gamma distribution function (eq. (10)) which is routinely used to
describe oral uptake in pkquest [5]. in some subjects
there is an early peak in the plasma ramiprilat following
oral ramipril that can only be explained by adding an
absorption component (ar) where the ramipril is directly
converted to ramiprilat either in the intestinal lumen or
epithelial cell and directly absorbed, bypassing the slower
liver and kidney pathways. finally, in some subjects the
plasma ramiprilat following oral ramipril remained constant between 200 and 3000 minutes (about 2 days),
requiring the addition of a slow delayed ramipril absorption component (aslow), presumably representing enterohepatic recirculation and/or large intestinal absorption.
figures 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 show the model plots and
tables 2, 3 and 4 list the values of the adjustable parameters for the iv and oral ramipril input for each of the 11
subjects. the plots provide a good view of the large individual variation. for example, although the plasma ramipril concentration following an iv ramipril dose is nearly
identical for subjects 1 and 4 (fig. 8), the resulting peak
plasma ramiprilat concentration for subject 4 is nearly 5
times higher than for subject 1 (fig. 8). this is an indication of the large subject to subject variation in ramipril
metabolism. it can be seen that the pbpk model provides
an adequate description of this variation, with an average
weighted error of about 20% (tables 2 and 3). the only
exception is subject 5 (fig. 11) where the plasma ramiprilat following oral ramipril falls much more rapidly to
non-detectable levels than the model predicts. figure 14
shows a plot of the sum of the intestinal absorption rate
of the major and slow ramipril components for all subjects. (this does not include the direct ramiprilat absorption component.) the total oral absorption varies from
1500 to 3487 nanomoles, representing 25 to 58% of the
2.5 mg dose. the average total absorption was 35% of the
oral dose. this is 12% greater than the 23.2% total
amount of ramipril and its metabolites that was recovered
in the urine in these same subject [38] and is consistent
with measurements of verho et. al. [65] that an additional
17% of the oral dose is excreted in the bile in humans.
ace assay
in addition to the ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations,
the experimental ace activity was also determined for
each plasma sample. what is reported is the fractional
enzyme activity which is defined as equal to the amount
of the test substrate hydrolyzed in 60 minutes relative to
the hydrolysis in the absence of ace inhibitor (see methods). this activity is proportional to the fraction of the
ace sites that are unoccupied by ramiprilat. the assay
activity is not equal to the true in vivo activity because the

(kc = 0.039 nm) there is little change in inhibitor binding,
while for the lower affinity n site (kn = .276 nm), there is

a large change during the 60 minutes as the ramiprilat dissociates because of the assay dilution. the activity at time

incubation (assay60, eq. (13)). figure 16 shows a comparison of the "true" in vivo fractional ace inhibition (at t =
0) versus the 60 minute assay activity for varying concentrations of the plasma ramiprilat. for the high affinity c
site, the experimental assay does not differ significantly
from the true activity, while for the lower affinity n site
the assay activity can be as much as 70% greater than the
true activity.

the iv ramiprilat, iv ramipril and oral ramipril input in
subject 4. if the two sites are independent, the experimental ace activity should be the weighted average of the
individual catalytic activity of the n and c sites which
have different substrate selectivity [19,21,66]. since there
is no information about the individual site activity for the
substrate used in this assay ([3h]benzoylglycylglycylglycine), one cannot determine which one (or both) of the
sites is being assayed by this procedure. the ace activity
is closest to that of the n site suggesting that this substrate
is hydrolyzed primarily by the n site. (for the n site, the
assay activity should be about 50% greater than the "true"
fraction inhibited, see fig. 16). the relationship between
the fraction of the sites occupied by ramiprilat and the
experimental activity will be further complicated if there is
negative cooperativity between the sites, as suggested by
skirgello et. al. [20]

arrangement required to describe the experimental ramipril/ramiprilat kinetics. there is direct experimental evidence that qualitatively supports all of the model
assumptions. the following lists the major assumptions
of the model along with the experimental support.
1. plasma ace has two independent high affinity binding
sites (n and c terminal) with kinetics described by eq. (2).
this is directly supported by in vitro measurements
[19,21]. however, the only known values of the kinetic
constants for ramiprilat binding are at 4°c and 300 mm
nacl (see methods). for lack of better information, these
are the values that have been used in the pbpk model.
2. tissue ace is identical to circulating plasma ace. the
strongest support for this assumption is that it has been
shown that plasma ace is directly derived from the membrane bound tissue ace by post-translational proteolytic
cleavage [28,29]. this is a critical assumption. tissue ace
represents more than 90% of the total ace and is the site
of the clinical action of the ace inhibitors [9]. this
assumption allows one to use a single set of binding constants derived from in vitro measurements on tissue ace
to predict the plasma and tissue kinetics.

3. ramiprilat is an extracellular solute and ramipril distributes in all the body water. the ramiprilat assumption
is supported by the relatively low ramiprilat octanol/water
distribution coefficient of 0.011 at ph 7.0 [42]. direct
support for this assumption is provided by the observation that ramiprilat has a very slow rate of crossing the
blood-brain barrier, with a free ramiprilat csf/plasma
ratio of about 0.02 2 hours after an iv ramiprilat injection
in dogs [67]. this assumption simplifies the description of
the ramiprilat distribution kinetics since it allows the use
of the previously determined pbpk set of extracellular volume and albumin binding parameters [6]. (the special
transport systems that extrude ramiprilat from liver and
kidney cells are an exception to this assumption). in contrast, the free ramipril csf/plasma ratio 2 hours after iv
ramipril is about 2 [67], supporting the model assumption that ramipril has a high cell membrane permeability
and distributes in all the body water.
4. both the liver and kidney cells take up ramipril, hydrolyze it to ramiprilat and release it back to the circulation.

the pbpk modeling of the rate of uptake, metabolism and
release determines the kinetics of plasma ramipril and
ramiprilat following a ramipril input. the investigations
of pang and colleagues [43-49] of enalapril and enalaprilat kinetics in perfused rat liver and kidney provide direct
qualitative confirmation of this assumption. for the subjects in this study, 0 to 60% (mean = 25%) of the total
ramipril metabolism occurs in the kidney (table 3). this
is consistent with the observation that ramipril clearance
decreases by about 50% in patients with renal failure [6870]. (one publication found no change in ramipril clearance in renal failure [71].)
5. the only site of ramiprilat removal is renal clearance.
this is consistent with the observation of a 3 to 4 fold
decrease in ramiprilat clearance in renal failure patients
with a 3 to 4 fold reduction in creatinine clearance
[69,71].

6. all of the ramiprilat produced from ramipril by the kidney is released back to the systemic circulation and is not
excreted in the urine. this can be directly tested by comparing the renal ramiprilat clearance for the iv ramipril
input versus the iv ramiprilat input. if some of the ramipril is directly converted to ramiprilat and excreted by the
kidney then one would expect a greater apparent ramiprilat clearance with the iv ramipril input. comparing the
average value of this clearance in the 11 subjects for the
first 240 minutes when most of the ramiprilat is
unbound, there was no significant difference in the clearances for the two inputs (0.364 vs 0.365 l/min).
7. there are 3 components of intestinal absorption of oral
ramipril (table 4): 1) the major ramipril component
described by a gamma function (eq. (10)) that is similar
to what has been used to describe the absorption of many
other drugs [5] (81% of the total absorption); 2) a much
slower ramipril component that extends out to 3000 minutes (13%); 3) direct intestinal conversion of ramipril to
ramiprilat which is then absorbed (6%). the slow component could represent either enterohepatic recirculation
[65] or slow absorption from the large intestine. although
there is no evidence in humans to support the existence of

the direct ramiprilat absorption, pang et. al. [48] have
observed this component using a perfused rat intestine
preparation.
there are a total of 12 adjustable parameters in the pbpk
model: 4 for ramiprilat (renal clearance, plasma ace, and
renal and liver cell membrane permeability, table 2); 3
describing the ramipril metabolism and conversion to
ramiprilat (table 3); and 5 characterizing the rate of oral
ramipril absorption (table 4). although this may seem
like a lot, it should be emphasized that they are used to
describe 3 separate data sets (iv ramiprilat, iv ramipril
and oral ramipril) along with the renal ramiprilat excretion data. in addition to describing the distribution and
clearance of ramipril and ramiprilat, this pbpk model also
describes: 1) the liver and kidney cellular uptake and
metabolism of ramipril; 2) the fraction of the total ramipril metabolism that is converted to ramiprilat; 3) the rate
of intracellular ramiprilat production in the liver and kidney; 4) the rate that intracellular ramiprilat enters the systemic circulation; 5) the intestinal absorption of ramipril;
and 6) the time dependent binding to plasma and tissue
ace. for comparison, a simple linear compartmental

parameters) and intestinal absorption (5 parameters).
additional parameters would be required to describe the
non-linearity and the individual c and n binding sites.
the pbpk model uses experimentally realistic parameters
and, as shown in figs. 4 and 5 and figs. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
provides a good description of the individual subject variation, with an average weighted residual error of about
20% for all the data (table 2 and 3).
clinical implications
there is now a general consensus that the most rational
approach to answering questions about dosage and efficacy of the different ace inhibitors should be based on an
analysis of the quantitative inhibition of tissue ace [9].
the most direct approach to this question is to measure
the plasma ace activity as a function of time. this should
provide a good measure of tissue ace inhibition because,
as is shown below, tissue and plasma ace should have the
same fractional inhibition at long times. unfortunately,
the standard plasma ace activity measurements have an
uncertain relationship to the true in vivo activity for two
reasons: 1) during the assay, the ace activity decreases
because of dilution of the ace inhibitor (see figs. 15 and
16); and 2) the assay represents a weighted average of the
sum of the activity of the n and c sites for the test substrate used in the assay (see fig. 17). the activity of the c
site is most important for the renin-angiotensin system,

since, at physiological conditions (37°c, 50 mm nacl)
the c site has a 3 fold higher kcat and a 2.7 fold higher kcat/
km for hydrolysis of  xxxg99xxx  than the n site [66]. the
c site also has a higher activity for bradykinin and  xxxg2240xxx  hydrolysis [72]. since the physiological inhibitor
and substrate binding constants and the specific assay
substrate activity of the two sites are not known, it is not
possible to relate the assay activity to the true in vivo activity. another approach that has been used in animals is
direct measurements of tissue ace activity using radioinhibitor binding [26,59]. however, these displacement
binding measurements suffer from the same problems of
dilution and competition as the plasma assay measurements.
the major advantage of a pbpk model is that it has the
potential to predict the detailed time dependent tissue
ace activity for arbitrary dosage regimens of the different
ace inhibitors. the accuracy of these predictions

depends, of course, on the accuracy of the pbpk model.
the major uncertainty in the model described here is the
uncertainty in the value of the ramiprilat binding constants at physiological conditions. although the values
assumed for the "standard model" which are based on
measurements at 4°c and 300 mm nacl provide good
fits to the data, other combinations of binding constants
for the two sites also provide good fits. for example, an
equally good fit is obtained by assuming that the two sites
are identical and have a k of 0.14 nm, intermediate
between the standard value for the c site (kc = 0.039 nm)
and the n site (kn = .276 nm). the following analysis uses
the standard model fixed parameters and the average values of the adjustable parameters (table 2, 3, 4) to illus-

centration in a high (heart) and low (skeletal muscle)
blood flow tissue. after about 600 minutes, most of the
ramiprilat is bound to ace and the concentration in the
different tissues primarily reflects the difference in the tissue ace concentration (ace tissue/plasma = 1.0 for muscle and 1.7 for heart, table 1). the bottom two panels in
fig. 18 show the fraction of n and c ace sites that are
occupied by ramiprilat (i.e. the fraction inhibited) in the
plasma and the two tissues. the ace in the high blood
flow heart rapidly equilibrates with the plasma, while the
low flow skeletal muscle lags slightly behind the plasma.
the differences in fraction inhibited in the different tissues are small and, as a first approximation, the ace fractional activity in plasma is an accurate measure of the
fractional activity in tissue.
for this 2.5 mg oral dose, which is the lowest that is clinically recommended, the higher affinity c site is 80%
inhibited after 1 day and 55% inhibited after 4 days. since
the c site has the primary action on the renin-angiotensin
system (see above), a single, daily 2.5 mg dose of ramipril
should reduce the average activity of this system by about
80% or more (assuming the "standard" binding constants
and independent sites).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/6/1

figure 19 shows the plasma ramiprilat and the fractional
inhibition of the c and n site as the oral ramipril dose varies from 2.5 to 20 mg, the clinically recommended range.
this figure dramatically illustrates the non-linearity in the
pharmacokinetics produced by the high ace affinity
binding. at short times, the plasma ramiprilat is roughly
proportional to the dose and most of it is unbound and is
rapidly cleared by the kidney. at long times, most of the
ramiprilat is bound to ace and the plasma concentration
is determined primarily by the plasma ace concentration
and is relatively independent of the dose. the fractional
ace inhibition is also non-linear. this analysis suggests
that increasing the oral dose above 5 mg/day should not
significantly increase the clinical action of the drug since
it does not produce a significant increase in the fraction of
ace that is inhibited.
figure 20 shows the plasma ramiprilat and the fractional
inhibition of the c and n site for multiple oral ramipril
doses of either 2.5 mg once per day or 1.25 mg twice a day.
the once/day results agree with the experimental observation that the plasma concentration reaches a steady state
within one week with increases in peak concentration of
about 1.5 times that of the first dose [73]. an interesting
prediction of this analysis that may be clinically relevant
is that for the lower affinity n site the twice/day regimen
results in a significant increase in the average inhibition.
figure 21 shows the effect of a reduction in renal function
on the plasma ramiprilat for an oral ramipril dose of 2.5
mg once per day for 4 days. renal function has two effects
on the pharmacokinetics. about 23% of the conversion of
ramiprilat to ramipril occurs in the kidney (table 3).
reducing renal function will produce a small reduction in
plasma ramipril since it will shift some of the metabolism
of ramiprilat from the kidney where 100% is converted to
ramipril, to the liver where only about 25% (frl, table 3)
is converted to ramipril. the second effect of a reduction
in a renal function is a proportional reduction in systemic
clearance of ramiprilat. the summation of the two effects
can be seen in fig. 21 – with 50% and 75% reductions in
renal function producing an increase of 1.46 and 2.04 in
the peak ramiprilat concentration on the 4th day (approximately steady state). this increase for a 75% reduction is
similar to the increase on day 12 observed by schunkert
et. al. [68] in patients with similar reductions in creatinine
clearance.
although it has been known for many years that ace contains two functionally distinct and catalytically active
sites, little attention has been paid to the clinical implications of this. as this pbpk analysis demonstrates, the
quantitative clinical time and dosage dependence of the
ace inhibition for a particular ace inhibitor can be predicted if the in vitro binding kinetics of the two sites for

page 24 of 27

that ace inhibitor are known. surprisingly, no kinetic
binding measurements at physiological conditions (37°c
and 100 mm nacl) are available for any ace inhibitor.
probably the single most important implication of this
pbpk analysis is to emphasize the importance of the
measurement of these in vitro binding constants.

conclusion
because of the high affinity tight binding of the ace
inhibitors and the presence of two (n and c) ace binding
sites with different substrate specificity, the standard ace
assay cannot be directly related to the in vivo inhibition of
the renin-angiotensin system. the error in the assay
depends critically on a number of factors that are currently
not known, such as the inhibitor and substrate binding
constants, the catalytic activity of the two ace sites for the
assay substrate and possible interaction between sites.
thus, there are no reliable measurements of the time
dependence of the physiological plasma ace activity for
any ace inhibitor. this pbpk model provides the first
quantitative predictions of the pharmacokinetics of the
plasma and tissue ace inhibition of the individual n and
c binding sites. its main limitation is that it is assumed
that the n and c site in vitro binding constants determined at 4°c and 300 mm nacl are valid at physiological
conditions.
