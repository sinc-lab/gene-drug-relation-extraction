1987.-the
histamine
hz-receptor
on the human parietal cell has been characterized
by using
dose-response curves and the negative logarithm
of the molar
concentration
of an antagonist
(pa2) analyses of cimetidine
antagonism
of  xxxd324xxx , histamine,
and impromidine
stimulation in isolated human and rabbit gastric glands. to evaluate
the in vitro results,  xxxd324xxx -stimulated
gastric acid secretion
with and without cimetidine
was also studied in healthy subjects. in the in vivo model, individual
dose-response curves were
shifted to the right with increasing cimetidine
concentrations,
but this was counteracted
by increasing
 xxxd324xxx  doses, indireversible
antagonism.
the pa, values
cating competitive,
ranged from 6.1 to 6.3. in isolated human gastric glands, impromidine
was shown to be eight times more potent than
histamine,
indicating
higher receptor affinity, but the maximally stimulated
aminopyrine
accumulation
was the same as
for histamine,
and the pa, values for cimetidine
antagonism
did not dii’fer significantly,
i.e., 5.7 (histamine)
and 6.1 (impromidine).
in isolated rabbit gastric glands, cimetidine
inhibited the histamineand impromidine-stimulated
response with
pa, values of 6.0 and 7.3, respectively. impromidine
was shown
to be -100 times more potent than in human gastric glands,
whereas histamine
had the same potency. this confirms the
role of the histamine
hz-receptor
and suggests a difference
between the species concerning receptor affinity.

histamine
h2-receptors
were originally defined as
those cell membrane sites mediating histamine responses
such as dilatation of blood vessels and stimulation of
gastric acid secretion (4). the importance of histamine
in the stimulatory pathway(s) of gastric acid secretion is
today widely recognized, and it has also been established
that cimetidine behaves as a simple competitive inhibitor
of histamine on acid secretion (1). in most models for
studying the h2-receptor of the parietal cell, the isolated
lumen-perfused stomach of the mouse has been used (1,
6). the technique of preparing isolated gastric glands
from rabbit mucosal tissue (3), using aminopyrine (ap)
accumulation as an index of acid secretion, enables further characterization
of the h2-receptor of the parietal

cell (7). this technique has been adapted to humans (10).
the aim of this study is to characterize the h2-receptor
on the human parietal cell using the isolated gastric
gland preparation and also to compare the human and
the rabbit parietal cell h2-receptor under as uniform
conditions as possible.
the isolated gastric gland preparation offers advantages such as standardized experimental conditions and
straightforward
stimulus-response
detection. on the
other hand, all in vitro models involve certain steps in
their preparation that may influence or even damage the
receptors on the cell surface. therefore, to evaluate the
in vitro results and to further characterize the h2-receptor of the human parietal cell in vivo, the  xxxd324xxx ( xxxd324xxx , eli lilly) stimulated gastric acid secretion in
healthy subjects was determ ined with di fferen t background
doses of cimetidine.
the present study was designed to allow h2-receptor
characterization using dose-response curves and the negative logarithm of the concentration
of an antagonist
(pa2) analyses in vitro as well as in vivo.

acid secretion by the human gastric gland in vitro. the

technique is described in detail elsewhere (10). tissue
was obtained at surgery from nine patients (32-73 yr,
median 50) undergoing partial gastrectomy necessitated
by gastric ulceration. after the antrum had been removed, a wedge-shaped piece of the fundic mucosa was
resected from the major curvature of the corpus region
to facilitate the creation of the anastomosis, and in
oxygenated phosphate-buffered
saline solution the mucosa was transported to the laboratory. the resected
mucosa was prepared as described (10).
the acid production was calculated as the ratio between ap in intraglandular
and extraglandular
water
(ap ratio) (2). in all experimental series glands were also
incubated with low2 m sodium thiocyanate (ap ratio
being -6.7), which was considered as blank value and
subtracted from all experimental ap ratios (11). all
incubations were run in duplicate, and the mean value
was calculated.

preparation.
the procedure was in other respects as
described above for human gastric glands.
acid secretion by the human gastric gland in uivo. eight
healthy males (24-34 yr old, median 26) were intubated
with a double-lumen nasogastric tube (salem sump tube,
argyle, division of sherwood medical) after an overnight
fast and, under fluoroscopic control, the tube was placed
in the antrum. the gastric juice was collected in 15min
aliquots by a suction pump giving a negative pressure
once per second. phenol red was used as a marker to
estimate losses of gastric juice to the duodenum.
the phenol red concentration in the collected gastric
contents was determined spectrophotometrically
at 565
nm after millipore filtration and alkalinisation to ph 12.
the gastric acidity was determined by automatic titration to ph 7.0. after correction for pyloric losses, the
calculated gastric output was expressed in millimoles per
15min. the basal gastric secretion was determined for 1
h before a continuous intravenous infusion of cimetidine
was started. three different doses (16, 26, and 40 mg/h)
were used, except in two cases when 8 mg/h was also
tested. to allow the serum concentration
of cimetidine
to reach a steady state before the experiment was commenced, the infusion of  xxxd324xxx  was not started until 1
h later. the concentrations
of cimetidine were then
found to vary ~10% during the infusion of  xxxd324xxx .
graded doses of  xxxd324xxx  were administered by intravenous infusion for 1 h at each dose (3, 9,52, 162, and 298
mg/h). the output of acid during the last 15-min period
of each  xxxd324xxx  dose was used for dose-response calculations. during this period, blood samples in duplicate
were also taken to determine the serum concentration of
cimetidine. the mean value was then used in calculating
the pa, value. when no cimetidine was given and the
response to  xxxd324xxx  only was determined, the highest
dose of  xxxd324xxx  was omitted. thus six subjects had four
secretion tests and two subjects had five tests.
this study was approved by the ethical committee of
the university of goteborg, sweden.
definition of pa2. by definition,
pa, is the negative
logarithm of the molar concentration
of an antagonist
that necessitates a doubling of the agonist concentration
to maintain the effect (16). hence, the pa, of a competitive antagonist has the same importance as the dissociation constant of the antagonist-receptor
interaction and
is useful in characterizing receptors. for example, similar
receptors can be expected to give the same pa, for a
particular antagonist, and the pa, value will be independent of the agonist used.
use of agonists and antagonists. in the experiments
with isolated gastric glands, dose-response curves for
histamine, impromidine, and  xxxd324xxx  were constructed
in the absence and presence of cimetidine. the agonist
concentrations used are given in the figures. the concentrations of cimetidine were 5 x 10m6, 10m5, and 10m4 m
with histamine and 10b7, lo-“, and 10m5 m with impromidine.
in the in vivo experiments, the histamine analogue
 xxxd324xxx  was used instead of histamine, since histamine

the slopes are close to unity (table l), indicating competitive antagonism between histamine and cimetidine.
by definition, the pa, value for cimetidine should be
constant for any agonist used on the assumption that
cimetidine exclusively interacts with the hz-receptor. to
test this hypothesis,
dose-response curves were also ob-tained with impromidine and- xxxd324xxx . impromidine is a
specific histamine hz-receptor agonist, whereas  xxxd324xxx 
is known as an agonist of human acid secretion in vivo
and as having at least some specificity for the hz-receptor. from the dose-response curves (fig. 2) it is evident
that in human parietal cells impromidine was more potent than histamine (-8 times), whereas the maximally
stimulated ap accumulation was about the same as for
histamine (table 1). a pa, value of 6.1 was calculated
for cimetidine antagonism to impromidine stimulation.
thus almost identical pa, values were obtained for cimetidine irrespective of whether histamine or impromidine was used.  xxxd324xxx  was -100 times less potent than
histamine (table 1) and not potent enough to allow the
construction of accurate dose-response curves with increasing concentrations of cimetidine when the human
gastric gland preparation was used.

the experiments performed in human-isolated gastric
glands were repeated with isolated glands from rabbit
mucosal tissue. the dose-response curves for histamine,
impromidine,
and  xxxd324xxx  are shown in fig. 3. there
was a clear difference in the stimulatory effect of impromidine and  xxxd324xxx  on ap accumulation between
human and rabbit isolated gastric glands, whereas the
ecso for histamine was about the same (table 1). impromidine was -100 times more potent in the rabbit vs.
human gastric glands.  xxxd324xxx  was even less potent in
the rabbit glandular system than in human glands, which
makes it difficult to estimate accurate ec= values. the
pa, values for cimetidine were relatively constant, although a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)
was seen between histamine and impromidine

individual dose-response curves were shifted to the right
with increasing concentration of cimetidine, but it was
possible to counteract the inhibitory effect with increasing doses of  xxxd324xxx , indicating competitive, reversible
antagonism. by use of the gastric acid responses in each
experiment and in each individual, the edw values were
calculated according to hofstee. the mean pa, value was
then 6.3 t 0.28.
the material was also pooled and eds0 determined.
the results are shown in table 2. the pa, value for
cimetidine antagonism of  xxxd324xxx  stimulation calculated
on the pooled data was 6.1.
discussion
the isolated gastric gland preparation makes it possible to characterize the histamine hz-receptor on the
parietal cell surface under as uniform conditions as possible. together with the isolated cell preparation (17),
the isolated glands constitute unique preparations
in
which the conditions at the parietal cell level can be
studied. in contrast to the isolated cell preparation, the
isolated glands provide the parietal cell with a cellular

the calculations of paz can, in principle, be made by
determining the dose ratio of a1:a resulting from a molar
concentration
of the antagonist. in practice, however,
inherent errors and biological variability require a set of
dose ratios corresponding to a set of antagonist concentrations. a particular level of response to the agonist is
selected, and the dose ratios for this response are paired
with antagonist molar concentration.
the dose ratio
should be determined in the midrange (linear) portion of
the response to avoid errors that may arise near the
physiological limit of the response. therefore e& values
were calculated.
because histamine itself has certain side effects, the
histamine analogue  xxxd324xxx  was used in the in vivo
experiments. until now, there has been no conventional
method for determining serum concentration of  xxxd324xxx .
therefore, no data are available on the relationship
between the serum concentration
of  xxxd324xxx , administered dose, and glandular concentration. in this study we
have used an intravenous infusion of  xxxd324xxx , and it
cannot be excluded that the  xxxd324xxx  concentration
at
the glandular level might vary interindividually.
therefore, in the in vivo experiments, each individual has been
studied separately as well as the material as a whole. the
pa, values vary from 6.1 when the data were pooled to
6.3 when each individual was studied separately. this
difference is of no significance, since the variability of
the pa, value itself is up to 0.5 (16).
in the in vivo model the infusion of cimetidine was
commenced 1 h before the  xxxd324xxx  infusion was started
to minimize an accumulation of cimetidine during each
experiment. an increase of the cimetidine concentration
would shift the latter part of the dose-response curves
further to the right, thereby reducing its slope. also the
ecso values would be elevated. starting the cimetidine
infusion 1 h before the experiment meant that the increase in the serum concentrations
did not exceed 10%
during the experiment. furthermore,
to increase the
accuracy of the gastric acid responses obtained, these
were corrected for losses to the duodenum.
in the human parietal cell, the pa, characterization
of
the histamine hz-receptor shows values ranging from 6.1
to 6.3 in the in vivo model and from 5.7 to 6.1 in the
isolated gastric gland preparation for cimetidine antagonism. these very similar results indicate that there was
no significant difference regarding the histamine hzreceptor between the in vivo and in vitro models used in
the present study.

on

parietal

cells

in isolated rabbit gastric glands, chew et al. (7) found
that histamine stimulated acid production by exclusively
activating the histamine hz-receptor, and that cimetidine antagonized histamine stimulation with a pa, of
6.8. our results on isolated rabbit gastric glands further
confirm these findings, since cimetidine inhibited both
the histamine and the impromidine stimulatory response
with pa, values of 6.0 and 7.3, respectively, which is well
within the range previously found (7, 17).
at the human parietal cell level, it can also be concluded that histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion
via the histamine hz-receptor, since the highly specific
hz-receptor agonist impromidine was more potent than
histamine. cimetidine also antagonized both the histamine and the impromidine responses with the same pa,
value. another finding supporting this conclusion was
that the  xxxd3050xxx , a highly potent hi-receptor antagonist (pa2 -9), failed to inhibit histamine-stimulated
ap
accumulation
in concentrations
<low5 m (data not
shown). this has also previously been described in the
canine parietal cells (17) and the rabbit gastric glands
(7)
even if the isolated rabbit and the human gastric
glands showed similarities regarding antagonism of the
hz-receptor and the response to histamine, there are
some considerations about the effect of impromidine. in
both species, the increased potency of impromidine
seemed to be due to an increased affinity to the hzreceptor, whereas the maximal stimulatory response was
unchanged. this is in contrast to the findings concerning
isolated whole rat stomach (15), where impromidine was
-100 times more potent but only reached half the maximal response obtained with histamine. in bullfrog gastric mucosa, impromidine failed to stimulate respiration,
and furthermore, acted as an inhibitor of the histamine
response (12). the difference in the potency of impromidine found in the rabbit and human gastric glands might
therefore very well be due to differences in the species
with respect to receptor affinity, although changes during
preparation altering the affinity for impromidine,
but
not histamine, cannot be excluded.
in conclusion, our results indicate that the isolated
gastric gland preparation is suitable when studying the
hz-receptor. furthermore,
our results confirm the histamine-acid secretion- xxxg1079xxx  concept.
