the autonomic nervous system is divided into the parasympathetic and
sympathetic systems, with three types of adrenergic receptors: alpha (smooth muscle
contraction), beta, (cardiac acceleration and fatty acid mobilization) and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
(smooth muscle relaxation). substances affecting the function of the adrenergic
system are the agonists or stimulators, which mimic the effects of endogenous
norepinephrine or epinephrine, and antagonists or blockers, which block the receptors
and prevent stimulation by the agonists. autonomic stimulation in the eye mediates
various changes which apparently affect outflow facility and rate of formation of
aqueous humor. alteration of either or both of these factors by autonomic agonists or
antagonists may have a direct or an indirect effect on intraocular pressure. betaadrenergic blocking substances have been used to treat a variety of diseases. some of
the effects of these drugs are attributable to properties other than beta blockade, such
as intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and local anaesthetic activity. side effects of
this class of drugs require caution in cases of congestive heart failure and in
asthmatics. autonomic agents used in the treatment of ocular hypertension and
glaucoma include pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, epinephrine, an adrenergic
agonist, and various beta adrenergic blockers or antagonists including propranolol,
atenolol and  xxxd3377xxx . the physico-chemical properties and pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3377xxx  are reviewed. data showing a significant reduction in intraocular pressure as a
result of ocular instillation of  xxxd3377xxx  are presented. reduction of the rate of aqueous
formation appears to be the mechanism of action. a low incidence of non-serious side
effects is reported. (surv ophthalmol 23:347-362, 1979)

overview of the development of the betaadrenergic blocking agents as therapeutic
agents for the treatment of glaucoma. the
autonomic nervous system, specifically the
adrenergic components, will be reviewed. we
will also briefly discuss the concept and
classification of these receptors as applicable
to the adrenergic nervous system, the general
medical uses of the beta-adrenergic blockers,
a classification system for these agents, and
the influence of the adrenergic nervous
system on aqueous humor dynamics and intraocular pressure. some historical perspective on and general uses of the betaadrenergic blocking agents for the treatment
of glaucoma and a summary of the basic
scientific and clinical studies of  xxxd3377xxx  will be
presented.

i. autonomic nervous system
a. autonomic

nervous

system

components

the nervous system is composed of two
major divisions, the afferent and the efferent.
the efferent nervous system is divided into
the somatic or “voluntary” nervous system
and the autonomic or “involuntary” nervous
system. the autonomic system is further divided into the parasympathetic system, using
acetylcholine as the chemical that bridges the
neural junction, and the sympathetic system
affected by epinephrine (adrenalin) and using
norepinephrine as the neurotransmitter at the
effector site. stimulation of the sympathetic
system releases norepinephrine
into the
neural junctions and also causes the adrenal

medulla to release epinephrine into the circulation, which produces a simultaneous
“whole body” adrenergic response. the
adrenergic receptors have been subdivided
into alpha and beta, and the beta receptors
divided into beta, and beta*. (table 1).
both the parasympathetic and sympathetic
systems innervate the heart, smooth muscle
and most glands. the cholinergic system acts
to maintain normal body functions in a
steady state or homeostasis, and is in control
during rest and repose. the adrenergic system responds to change in the environment
with bodily changes designed to meet the
challenge, the “fight or flight” reaction, including increasing blood flow to the skeletal
muscles, inhibiting gastrointestinal tract activity, and increasing energy production
(table 2).
the effects obtained through the activation
of the adrenergic system are mediated by the
stimulation of receptors in the target tissue by
the transmitter or agonist. conversely, the
effect of the agonist can be prevented by the
introduction of a correspondingly specific antagonist or blocker which prevents the agonist
from binding with the receptor. it is the
specificity of the alpha, beta, and beta, receptors that divides the adrenergic system into
three parts, although some agonists and antagonists react with more than one type of
receptor. acetylcholine,
epinephrine, and
norepinephrine are the endogenous transmitters in the cholinergic and adrenergic systems; however, many substances have been
found to either mimic or block their effects.

to different sympathomimetic
amines are used extensively to discriminate
alpha receptors from beta, and beta, from
beta,.
the concept of receptors or “receptive substances” was first proposed by langley,72v’3
and the division of the adrenergic receptors
into two types was suggested by dale’p work
as early as 1906. in 1939, youmans145j46
the responses

postulated two or more adrenergic receptors
to explain the effects of a series of sympathomimetic
amines on a variety of tissues.
ahlquist,1*2-3 in 1948, classified the receptors

as alpha and beta depending on the strength
of response to a set of sympathomimetic
amines. according to his division, the alpha
adrenergic receptors mediate generally excitatory or contractile functions such as
vasoconstriction and other smooth muscle
contraction.
beta-adrenergic
receptors
generally mediate inhibitory or relaxation
functions, such as vasodilation and relaxation
of smooth muscle. one contradiction in this
scheme was the finding that beta receptors
mediate one excitatory function, the stimulation of heart muscle contractility.
landf7“ proposed in 1949 dividing the
receptors into three groups, which eventually
evolved into the current classification of
alpha adrenergic
receptors
(mediating
smooth muscle contraction), beta, adrenergic
receptors (mediating cardiac acceleration and

fatty acid mobilization), and beta, adrenergic
receptors (mediating smooth muscle relaxation).122*5*71
drugs which affect the function of the
adrenergic nervous system are divided into
two categories: stimulators, the alpha and
beta agonists, which mimic the effect of endogenous norepinephrine and epinephrine;
and blockers, the alpha and beta antagonists,
which bind to the receptors and prevent their
stimulation by endogenous agonists (table 3).
b. ocular autonomic

nervous system

components

in the eye, the autonomic
nervous system
mediates various changes, some of which are
apparently related to changes in intraocular
pressure.
stimulation of the alpha receptors in the
meridional smooth muscle of the iris by the
adrenergic nervous system causes dilation of
the pupil (mydriasis).6 the opposing sphincter
muscle of the iris is constricted (miosis) by the
stimulation of mostly cholinergic receptors; it
may be that the sphincter also has beta receptors which relax the muscle, working in concert with stimulation of the meridional muscle to dilate the pupil.‘ooantagonists would in
each case block the receptors, and cause a
reduction or elimination of the expected
effect of stimulation.

although
there is not yet general agreement on alpha
versus beta classification in the various
species. the rabbit has both alpha and beta
receptors;“’
the monkey apparently has
mostly beta receptors,g4 and humans probably
follow this latter pattern. stimulation of these
receptors seems to increase outflow, but the
mechanism is unclear.
the ciliary muscle responds to both
adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation, having both types of receptors and innervation.
cholinergic stimulation constricts the muscle,
rounding up the lens for accommodation and
increasing outflow facility by mechanically
distorting the chamber angle during muscular
contraction. this is the mechanism of action
of pilocarpine and other miotic drugs used in
the treatment
of elevated
intraocular
pressure.64
stimulation of beta receptors in monkeys
relaxes the ciliary muscle, with the resultant
small accommodation change and a decrease
in outflow.22~128
adrenergic receptors (probably both alpha
and beta) in the afferent and efferent blood
vessels may regulate the blood supply to the
ciliary processes,** possibly affecting the rate
of aqueous formation.
this speculation
awaits further study.

adrenergic innervation has been found in
association with the pigmented epithelial cells
of the ciliary processes underlying the nonpigmented epithelium;86 if there is similar innervation of the nonpigmented epithelial cells
(which comprise the secretory tissue that
forms aqueous humor), adrenergic stimulation. could directly affect the rate of aqueous
formation. at this time, this also is still only
speculation.
c. autonomic

influence on intraocular

pressure

the autonomic nervous system presumably
affects intraocular pressure by influencing the
rate of formation and the rate of outflow of
aqueous humor. since intraocular pressure is
dependent on both of these rates, any substance which affects either factor will produce
a net change in intraocular pressure. intraocular pressure is reduced by cholinergic
agonists, and by both alpha and beta agonists
and antagonists. some of these substances
affect rate of formation, some affect rate of
outflow, and some affect both rates to varying
degrees. pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist,
reduces slightly the rate of aqueous formation, but greatly increases the rate of aqueous
outflow.4o it has been reported that  xxxd2401xxx , a beta adrenergic agonist, has lit-

351

beta adrpnergicrlocking agents and glaucoma

tle effect on the rate of outflow, but greatly
reduces the rate of aqueous formation.‘12
both means produce the same end - a net
drop in intraocular pressure. it is extremely
difficult to understand the influence of the
autonomic
drugs
on aqueous
humor
dynamics. if the literature is searched in this
respect, one can find opposing agents having
the same effect and the effects of the same
agent varying. some of the confusion arises
from studies done in animals followed by
loose extrapolation to man; some of the
problems may be due to differences in innervation between animals and man.75 care must
be taken in the extrapolation of experimental
animal data to man, as pharmacological
effects5’m60 and anatomy may be quite
different. hopefully, further pharmacologic
and anatomic studies will clear up some of
this confusion.
ii. beta adrenergic blocking agents
a. history of the beta blockers

the first specific beta adrenergic blocker
dichloroisoproterenol
(dci) was introduced
by powell and slater in 1958 and was found
to cause transient beta stimulation before exerting the blocking effect.104,118pronethalol,
developed shortly thereafter,
shows less
stimulating effect preceeding blocking action.‘3,33 however, when tested for use as a
hypotensive agent, pronethalol was found to
be linked with tumor production in mice98 and
had other unattractive side effects in man.
the first therapeutically useful beta adrenergic antagonist or blocker, proprano101,12j06
introduced in 1964, was the only beta blocking agent released for clinical use in the
united states uniil recently, although more
than 18 drugs of this class are in current use
overseas. in 1968,  xxxd2991xxx  was developed as
the first beta blocking agent which selectively
inhibits cardiac receptors3’ atenolol, another
selective beta blocker, was synthesized in
1973,7 and, in the intervening years, other
similar molecules with beta, selectivity have
come to light.  xxxd3377xxx , recently released for
topical ophthalmic use, is the first beta blocker
released for such use in this country.
b. general medical use of beta blockers

beta antagonists, such as propranolol, have
been used to reduce systemic hypertension,lo6
and to treat angina pectoris, cardiac arrhyth-

mias, and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
they have been considered as possible palliatives for a broad range of disorders including thyrotoxicosis, tremor, anxiety and migraine. 8.21.23.30-32.54~58,65,74,99,111,116,1~1,1~4.~27,13~,141
the effects of anxiety are seen to be partly
a result of beta-adrenergic stimulation; blocking this stimulation by beta antagonists may
diminish such anxiety related symptoms as
tachycardia, tremor, sweating and paipitations.123*125
not all the effects of beta antagonists are
due directly to the blockade of the beta receptors. some of these drugs also display various
additional effects, such as intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (transitory stimulation
of adrenergic receptors prior to blocking action) and membrane stabilizing effects (local
anaesthetic properties).34,92 (table 4). this
latter characteristic is probably what makes
propranolol useful in the treatment of cardiac
arrhythmias.
in their review of the psychopharmacology
of beta adrenergic blockade, greenblatt and
shader49 cite the central nervous system
(cns) effects of propranolol as sedative, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxing, similar to
those of pronethalol. inpea, on the other
hand, seems to have a central stimulant
effect;  xxxd2991xxx  penetrates the cns poorly;
 xxxd123xxx 
shows only some of the
propranolol cns effects, and sotalol has a
sedative effect only at very large doses.
c. side effects of systemically
administered

beta

blockers

as described above, pronethaiol, when
tested clinically as a treatment for hypertension, produced lightheadedness and slight incoordination leading to nausea and vomiting
in patients.lo5 its use was discontinued when
pagetea found that prolonged administration
was linked with production of tumors in mice.
propranolol, in current clinical use mainly
as a hypotensive agent, has shown few side
effects in otherwise normal patients, but
because of its status as a blocker of beta,
receptors, it exacerbates the effects of heart
failure in patients who require intense sympathetic stimulation of the heart to remain
compensated. also, it blocks beta, receptors,
causing relaxation of the smooth muscle of
the bronchioles, and is not recommended for
asthmatics. various other side effects have
been reported, 24,27,53,62,67,83,86,37,93.122.129 including

d. beta blockers and glaucoma

the first report of a beta-adrenergic
blocking
drug’s decreasing
intraocular
pressure in man was published by phillips et
al in 1967.1°2in seven glaucoma patients they
found a decrease in intraocular pressure when
10 mg propranolol
was injected intravenously. these findings were corroborated
by several other studiesz5,“’ and several
patients were found to have sustained
decreases in intraocular pressure following
oral treatment
with proprano101.10~11~g6+‘g
topical application of propranolol in concentrations of 1 to 4% has been shown to lower
intraocular pressure,20~101~1so~1a’
but ocular discomfort and stinging limited the use of
propranolol
in eye drops.26 however,
systemic propranolol is still being clinically
tested as an ocular hypotensive agent.g1
in 1973, vale and phillips132 showed that
 xxxd2991xxx  also decreased intraocular pressure,
but enthusiasm for this drug waned following

the treatment of glaucoma
a. physico-chemical

properties

 xxxd3377xxx  maleate, c13hz,n,0ss*clh104, is
a white crystalline powder, soluble in water,
methanol and alcohol, with a pk, of approximately
9 in water at 25°c. the
crystalline powder is sparingly soluble in
chloroform and  xxxd3034xxx , insoluble in
ether and cyclohexane, and very stable with
respect to light and temperature.  xxxd3377xxx 
maleate is available in concentrations of
0.25% and 0.5%. the active ingredient in each
milliliter of  xxxd3377xxx @ ophthalmic solution
0.25% (merck sharp & dohme) contains 2.5
mg  xxxd3377xxx  (3.4 mg of  xxxd3377xxx  maleate). each
milliliter of  xxxd3377xxx @ ophthalmic solution
0.5% contains 5.0 mg  xxxd3377xxx (6.8 mg  xxxd3377xxx 
maleate). other ingredients in  xxxd3377xxx @ include monobasic
and dibasic sodium
phosphate with sodium hydroxide to adjust
the ph. benzalkonium chloride 0.01% is used
as a preservative, the formulated product has
an approximately neutral ph ranging from
6.5 to 7.5. the solution is packaged in a white
polyethylene ophthalmic dispenser which is
opaque in order to protect the formulated
product from light. although the pure
chemical is extremely light stable, the formulated product is not as stable. expiration
date for  xxxd3377xxx @ ophthalmic solution is 2
years.bs~115

b.pharmacokinetics
there is very little information concerning
the fate of ocularly instilled  xxxd3377xxx  maleate
in humans because tissue sampling methods
are unsuitable for use in humans and because
blood levels of topically administered  xxxd3377xxx 
at recommended clinical doses are seldom
above the limit of detection using existing
assay methods.
animal studies of topically administered
 xxxd3377xxx  have proven more useful. aqueous
humor levels of  xxxd3377xxx  determined by gasliquid chromatography (glc) were similar in
sedated and nonsedated rabbits. the peak
levels of  xxxd3377xxx  in aqueous humor after a
single instillation of 50 ~1 0.5%  xxxd3377xxx  into
each eye were 272 ng/loo mg in the nonsedated rabbit and 339 ng/loo mg in the
levopromazine-sedated rabbit. after applying
50 ~1 1.5%  xxxd3377xxx  into each eye, the peak
aqueous humor level was 1338 ng/loo mg.
the peak level measurements by either gasliquid chromatography (glc) or liquid scintillation counting (lsc) were in the same
range, and the areas under the time concentration
curves were not significantly
different.88*115
in contrast to the aqueous humor levels,
serum levels in the area under the time concentration curves following instillation of
 xxxd3377xxx  were significantly higher by lsc than
by glc. as lsc measures total radioactivity and glc measures  xxxd3377xxx  only, it can
be concluded that only  xxxd3377xxx  is present in
the aqueous humor, whereas  xxxd3377xxx  and its
metabolites are present in serum. levels of
 xxxd3377xxx  equivalents in red blood cells (determined by lsc) measured 8, 16 and 24 hours
after a single instillation (50 ~1 of 1.5% into
each eye) ranged from 1.15 to 1.18 ng/loo
mg_89,115

the disposition
of topically instilled
 xxxd3377xxx  (50 ~1 of 1.5% “c- xxxd3377xxx  into each
eye) in the sedated rabbit is shown in table 5.

three groups of tissues were ranked by liquid
scintillation counting (lsc) according to the
order ofmagnitude of peak content of  xxxd3377xxx 
and metabolites. peak levels of radioactivity
were obtained within 10 to 60 minutes in all
tissues except the liver, in which peak levels
were obtained within 4 to 16 hours.8b+11s
although there is no information on the
pharmacokinetics of topically applied  xxxd3377xxx 
in humans, there has been some work done in
on systemically
administered
europe*
 xxxd3377xxx .  xxxd3377xxx  appears to be widely distributed in the body tissues with the apparent
volume of distribution approximately
1.5
liters/kg after oral or intravenous doses.136in
healthy volunteers,  xxxd3377xxx  was found to be
excreted primarily in the urine (73% of administered
radioactivity
in three days),
mainly as unidentified metabolites.126 after a
4 to 10 mg oral dose, elimination half-life
appeared to be about 2 to 5 hours.12s,136
according to vermeij et a&is6the plasma
half-life of orally administered  xxxd3377xxx  is
closer to 2.5 hours, and distribution in the
tissues is extensive; however, accumulation
after repeated oral administration is not
large, they theorize that the short plasma
half-life of the drug will lead to disadvantageous fluctuations during the dose intervals
which may be a problem with the orally administered form of the drug.
c. mechanism

of action

numerous suggestions based on relatively
scant evidence have been made concerning
the mechanism of the ocular hypotensive
effect of  xxxd3377xxx  and the other beta-blockers.
the possibilities include increased outflow
facility, reduced formation
of aqueous
humor, or some combination of the above.
other suggestions disregard beta blocker
effects on inflow or outflow, postulating
changes in the corneal-scleral envelope, action of the non-adrenergic tension effecters of
the central nervous system or effects from
surface anesthetic or quinidine-like properties.lsl
however, it has been shown that d-isomers
of propranolol
have virtually no betablocking activity and also no pressure lowering effect.lgl this is fair evidence that the
reduction in iop effected by the beta

continued use.16g’8similar single-dose studies
in which the rate of aqueous formation is
measured by fluorophotometry2s~144 have
shown decreases in this rate large enough to
account for the concomitant decrease in intraocular pressure (table 6). electrooculogram studies in healthy volunteers@’ also
support the theory that the decrease in intraocular pressure effected by  xxxd3377xxx  is due to a

similar to those in humans. norepinephrine
and epinephrine produced an additional
hypotensive response when added to the treatment of rabbits receiving  xxxd3377xxx . -topical
 xxxd3377xxx  not only decreased pressure in the eye

but also
produced a significant reduction in pressure

katz et a1.63 showed that  xxxd3377xxx , used
topically, in concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and
1.5% on 30 healthy volunteers, significantly
reduced intraocular pressure. there were no
significant differences among the three doses.
data from 17 clinical studies (5 18 patients)

used once or twice daily. onset of significant
decrease from base-line intraocular pressure
was approximately 20 to 30 minutes with all

labeled, longterm maintenance studies were
conducted on 252 patients with elevated intraocular pressure and open angles with the
usual concentrations
and dose schedule of
 xxxd3377xxx  applied for as much as 15 months. in

combining data from the four studies, it
became apparent that elevated intraocular
pressure was lowered to clinically acceptable
levels without significant loss of efficacy.8e
an interesting phenomenon occurs in some
patients who have good to excellent initial
responses to  xxxd3377xxx . after several weeks of
continued therapy, there appears to be a waning of the ocular hypotensive effect. in these
patients, the intraocular pressure does not
rise to the pretreatment baseline value, but
stabilizes at an approximate 20 to 25%
decrease from pretreatment level.“’ further
studies examining this effect are in progress.
seventeen independent clinical studies were
conducted which included 57 aphakic patients
(80 eyes) with glaucoma. some of these
patients were receiving other, concomitant
therapy. in follow-up as long as one year,
significant intraocular
pressure reduction
with  xxxd3377xxx  was observed in 43 of the 57
aphakic patients (76.8%). adverse reactions
were observed in 3 of the 57 aphakic patients

developed cystoid macular edema.
a study of 19 contact lens wearers using
 xxxd3377xxx  for chronic open-angle glaucoma
found that intraocular pressure was lowered
in 15 of the 19 patients without drug-related
adverse experience.bb~116
in the 5 18 patients from 17 comparison
studies mentioned above,  xxxd3377xxx  had no
more effwt on pupillary size than placebo and
caused
significantly
less conjunctival
hyperemia than epinephrine. schirmer testing
on 104 of these patients for a one-year period
showed no decrease in tear production. no
clinically significant changes in systolic or
diastolic blood pressure were seen in any of
the patients. resting pulse rate decreased
slightly (up to six beats per minute) in
several of the studies; this was usually seen
only during the first six months of  xxxd3377xxx 
therapy
after
which the effect
disappeared.*sj16

medication for the treatment of glaucoma. it
appears to be more effective in lowering intraocular pressure than any of the other
topical agents and seems to be better
tolerated than these agents.
it is of paramount
importance
that
longterm studies of  xxxd3377xxx  continue. yet to
be defined is a possible significant loss of efficacy in some patients using this medication
for extended periods. further studies must examine the waning of the ocular hypotensive
effect noted in some patients who initially
show a dramatic response to the drug.
preliminary studies have also shown  xxxd3377xxx 
to be additive with other ocular hypotensive
medications. these results have been shown
in only a small group of patients over a short
period of time and will need further study to
detail the interaction between  xxxd3377xxx  and
other ocular hypotensive drugs.
we have some indication of potential side
to date, we can state
effects of this agent. 15+16
that  xxxd3377xxx  should be used with caution in
patients with cardiovascular diseases,78 such
as bradycardia, second degree heart block, or
heart failure, and in patients with asthma.
there may be other ocular and systemic side
effects that will only be discovered through
longterm followup. three-to-five year studies
of a large number of patients have been
started to ascertain the safety and range of
effectiveness of  xxxd3377xxx  over long periods of
time.
