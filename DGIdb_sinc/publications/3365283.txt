effects of the novel 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor indalpine and ethanol on psychomotor performance.  twelve healthy male volunteers were treated double-blind and cross-over with 4-(3-indolyl-2-ethyl)piperidine (indalpine), a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake inhibitor with antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, and placebo for two weeks. soon after starting the treatment with indalpine (50 mg/d) they felt subjectively mild sedative-like effects which were abolished when retested after two weeks' maintenance (150 mg/d). objectively measured psychomotor performance (coordinative and reactive skills, standing steadiness, nystagmus, flicker recognition) was not, however, affected by indalpine. the only adverse effect attributable to indalpine was ejaculatory dysfunction which was spontaneously reported by 67% of the subjects. when alcohol (1 g/kg) was administered during the treatment periods most tests showed impairment. however, indalpine neither enhanced nor counteracted the effects of alcohol in this trial.
