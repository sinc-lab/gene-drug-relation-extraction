1 the long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2155xxx  (1010–106 m) inhibited the ige-dependent
release of histamine from human lung mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  xxxd2155xxx 
was more potent and a full agonist relative to the nonselective b-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2398xxx . by
contrast, the long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist salmeterol (1010–106 m) was about two-thirds less
efficacious than either  xxxd2155xxx  or  xxxd2398xxx  as an inhibitor of histamine release.
2  xxxd2398xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol (all  xxxd1891xxx 5 m) increased total cell camp levels in mast
cells over basal by 361790 (po0.05), 321789 (po0.05) and 64724% (p40.05), respectively.
3 long-term (24 h) incubation of mast cells with  xxxd2155xxx  (106 m) or salmeterol (106 m)
essentially abolished the subsequent ability of  xxxd2398xxx  to inhibit histamine release. both
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol were more effective at inducing the functional desensitisation than
 xxxd2398xxx  (106 m) or the short-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (106 m).
4 the desensitisation induced by long-term treatments with salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  was specific
for b2-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of histamine release as the inhibitory effects of alternative
camp-elevating compounds,  xxxd1903xxx , a receptor-mediated activator of adenylate cyclase,
and  xxxd1742xxx , a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, were unaffected by desensitising treatments.
5 radioligand binding studies were performed to determine b2-adrenoceptor density in cell
membranes after pretreatment (24 h) of cells with agonists.  xxxd2398xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol
(all  xxxd1891xxx 6 m) reduced b2-adrenoceptor density by 1375 (p40.05), 49713 (po0.05) and 35717%
(p40.05), respectively.
6 these data indicate that long-term exposure of mast cells to both salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  can
cause substantial levels of desensitisation to b2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mast cells.

introduction
the development of the b2-adrenoceptor agonists, salmeterol
and  xxxd2155xxx , constitutes an important advance in the
therapeutic management of asthma (waldeck, 2002). as
bronchodilators, both drugs have been shown to provide
symptomatic relief for longer periods (b12 h) compared to
older generation bronchodilators, such as salbutamol and
terbutaline, whose duration of action (b4 h) is shorter (dahl,
1995; lötvall, 2001). salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  are useful,
therefore, in situations where control of symptoms is desirable
for longer periods, such as in nocturnal asthma.
the mechanism by which salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  exert
long-lasting effects has been the topic of some debate. one
suggestion, to explain the long-lasting actions of salmeterol, is
the ‘exosite’ hypothesis wherein the aliphatic tail of salmeterol
engages an exosite, which may or may not be part of the
b2-adrenoceptor itself, permitting the active portion of the

molecule, potentially, to interact repeatedly with the
b2-adrenoceptor (coleman et al., 1996). this concept has not
been accepted universally and alternative explanations include
the suggestion that the lipophilicity of both salmeterol and
 xxxd2155xxx  allows their accumulation within lipid membranes
and, thereby, a more sustained availability of these drugs for
interaction with b2-adrenoceptors either by diffusion or by
gradual leaching of the drugs from the membrane (anderson
et al., 1994).
despite the benefits that bronchodilators afford, continued
exposure of asthmatics to bronchodilators can lead to
tolerance (svedmyr, 1990). both short-acting and long-acting
agonists have been shown to cause tolerance (o’connor et al.,
1992; cockcroft et al., 1993; yates et al., 1997; van der woude
et al., 2001). at the molecular level, tolerance may reflect b2adrenoceptor desensitisation. desensitisation is a complex,
time-dependent process that may involve the uncoupling,
sequestration and degradation of the receptor (lefkowitz,
1998). other processes that may contribute to the development

164

a.-m. scola et al

of tolerance include the downregulation of gsa, the protein
coupling the receptor to adenylate cyclase, and the upregulation of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme involved in degrading
camp (giembycz, 1996; finney et al., 2001).
although the main action of b2-adrenoceptor agonists is to
relax airways smooth muscle, additional effects may include
the stabilisation of inflammatory cell activity and, in this
regard, inhibitory effects on the pulmonary mast cell may be
important (barnes, 1999). indeed, a large number of studies
have shown that b-adrenoceptor agonists are very effective
inhibitors of mediator release from lung mast cells (butchers
et al., 1980; 1991; church & hiroi, 1987; lau et al., 1994; nials
et al., 1994). however, both in vivo and in vitro studies show
that mast cells can become tolerant to the effects of badrenoceptor agonists (van der heijden et al., 1984; o’connor
et al., 1992; cockcroft et al., 1993; chong & peachell, 1999).
our own studies show that long-term exposure of human lung
mast cells to short-acting b-adrenoceptor agonists attenuates
the inhibitory effects of b-adrenoceptor agonists on mast cells
(chong et al., 1995; 2000; 2003; drury et al., 1998; chong &
peachell, 1999). the aim of the present study was to determine
whether the long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists, salmeterol
and  xxxd2155xxx , are also capable of inducing desensitisation to
b-adrenoceptor agonists in mast cells.

b-adrenoceptor desensitisation in mast cells

isolation of mast cells
mast cells were isolated from human lung tissue by a
modification of the method described (ali & pearce, 1985).
the tissue was stripped of its pleura and chopped vigorously
for 15 min with scissors in a small volume of tyrode’s buffer.
the chopped tissue was washed over a nylon mesh (100 mm
pore size; cadisch and sons, london, u.k.) with 0.5–1 l of
tyrode’s buffer to remove lung macrophages. the tissue was
reconstituted in tyrode’s-bsa (10 ml per g of tissue) containing collagenase ia (350 u per ml of tyrode’s-bsa) and
agitated by using a water-driven magnetic stirrer immersed
in a water bath set at 371c. the supernatant (containing some
mast cells) was separated from the tissue by filtration over
nylon mesh. the collagenase-treated tissue was then reconstituted in a small volume of tyrode’s-bsa buffer and
disrupted mechanically with a syringe. the disrupted tissue
was then washed over nylon gauze with tyrode’s-bsa (300–
600 ml). the pooled filtrates were sedimented (120  g, room
temperature, 8 min), the supernatant discarded and the pellets
reconstituted in tyrode’s-bsa (100 ml). the pellet was washed
a further two times. the dispersion procedure generated 0.2 to
1  106 mast cells per g of lung tissue at 5–20% purity as
assessed by alcian blue staining (gilbert & ornstein, 1975).
these cell preparations were used in histamine release
experiments. mast cell-enriched preparations (430% purity)
were generated by countercurrent elutriation (beckman j6b
centrifuge, je-5.0 elutriator head) and further purification
(x85%) was achieved by flotation of mast cell-enriched
preparations over percoll density gradients using slight
modifications of the methods that have been described in
detail elsewhere (schulman et al., 1982; ishizaka et al., 1983).
purified mast cells were used in camp assays.

histamine release
histamine release experiments were performed in pbs.
histamine release from mast cells was initiated immunologically with an optimal releasing concentration of anti-ige
(1 : 300). secretion was allowed to proceed for 25 min at 371c
after which time the cells were pelleted by centrifugation
(400  g, room temperature, 3 min). histamine released into
the supernatant was determined by a modification of the
automated fluorometric method of siraganian (1974). when badrenoceptor agonists or alternative camp-active compounds
were employed, cells were incubated with agonist for 10 min at
371c before the addition of stimulus and then samples were
processed as indicated above. total histamine content was
determined by lysing aliquots of the cells with 1.6% perchloric
acid. cells incubated in buffer alone served as a measure of
spontaneous histamine release (o6%). histamine release was
thus expressed as a percentage of the total histamine content
after subtracting the spontaneous histamine release.
when long-term incubations were performed, rpmi 1640
buffer supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (10 mg ml1)
and gentamicin (50 mg ml1) was employed. cells were
incubated (24 h) at a density of 0.1  106 mast cells per ml in
six-well plates with, usually, 0.5  106 mast cells per condition
with or without a b-adrenoceptor agonist. after completion of
the incubations, the cells were washed three times with pbs
and reconstituted in the same buffer for mediator release
experiments. incubations of mast cells with the b-adrenoceptor

agonists had no effect on either the total number of mast cells
recovered, the total histamine content or the spontaneous
histamine release compared to mast cells incubated in buffer.
in preliminary experiments, the effect of long-term incubation
(24 h) of mast cells with the vehicle dmso (0.001%), which
was used to prepare some of the drugs (salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx ), on the  xxxd2398xxx  inhibition of histamine release was
determined. following this treatment with dmso, there was
no difference in the potency (control pd2 (negative logarithm
of the ec50), 8.470.2; pd2 after dmso, 8.670.3) or efficacy
(control emax, 3676% inhibition; emax after dmso, 3273%
inhibition) of  xxxd2398xxx  compared to control (n ¼ 7).

assays for camp
total cell camp levels were monitored according to methods
that have been described in more detail elsewhere (chong et al.,
1998). purified cells were incubated (10 min) without or with a
b-adrenoceptor agonist and the reaction terminated by the
addition of ice-cold acidified ethanol and snap-freezing of
samples in liquid nitrogen. after thawing, samples were
pelleted by centrifugation, supernatants saved and the ethanol
evaporated using a rotary evaporator. samples were reconstituted in assay buffer and camp levels were determined
using commercially available eia kits.

radioligand binding
mast cell-enriched (33–67% purity) preparations were employed for radioligand binding studies. highly purified mast
cell preparations were not used in these binding experiments as
the numbers of cells required could have only been generated
on a very occasional basis. however, previous studies of ours
have shown that these mast cell-enriched populations reasonably parallel the behaviour of purified mast cell preparations in
the context of b-adrenoceptor expression following exposure
to b-adrenoceptor agonists (chong et al., 2003). mast cellenriched (chong et al., 2003) preparations, like lung mast cells
(chong et al., 2002), express a homogeneous population of
b2-adrenoceptors.
membrane fractions were prepared from mast cell-enriched
preparations (x3  106 cells per condition) after treatment
(24 h) with buffer or a given b-adrenoceptor agonist. membranes were prepared by homogenising in ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx 
using an ultra turrax homogeniser for 20 s followed by four
strokes (  4) of a teflon homogeniser. the homogenate was
centrifuged (500  g, 40 min), the supernatant was harvested
and subjected to further centrifugation (40,000  g, 15 min) in
an ultracentrifuge (l80, beckman). the pellet was washed and
the high-speed centrifugation step repeated. the pellet was
resuspended in  xxxd3449xxx  and used in receptor binding assays.
all procedures were carried out at 41c. in saturation binding
assays, the membrane preparations were assayed for badrenoceptor binding sites using [125i]-cyanopindolol
([125i]cyp). membrane suspensions (100 ml) were incubated
(1 h, 371c) using a range of radioligand concentrations
(0.03125–2 nm) in a total volume of 250 ml. nonspecific
binding was determined by displacement with propranolol
(1 mm). specific binding, expressed as a percentage of the total
binding, ranged from 67 to 76% at a [125i]cyp concentration
of 0.0625 nm. additions of ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx  were used to
terminate the reactions followed by rapid filtration through

whatman gf/b glass fibre filters. the filters were rapidly
washed four times with 3 ml ice-cold buffer and the radioactivity remaining on filters measured in a packard cobra
auto-gamma counter. all binding experiments were performed
in duplicate. protein content of the membranes was determined by the method of lowry et al. (1951).

materials
the following were purchased from the sources indicated; antihuman ige, bsa, collagenase, dnase, hsa, percoll,  xxxd2398xxx , salbutamol, propranolol (all sigma, poole, u.k.);
[125i]cyp (new england nuclear, stevenage, u.k.); camp
eia kits (amersham, little chalfont, u.k.). salmeterol and
the aliphatic tail of salmeterol (gsk, stevenage, u.k.) and
 xxxd2155xxx  (yamanouchi, ibaraki, japan) were all kindly
provided as gifts.

data analysis
maximal responses (emax) and potencies (pd2) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (graphpad prism,
version 2). receptor densities (bmax) and radioligand affinity
(kd) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of
saturation curves (graphpad prism). to determine whether
there was any difference in the responses of mast cells after
treatments, either paired t-tests or repeated measures anova
was performed.

results
effects of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol on mast cells
the effects of  xxxd2398xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol (all at
1010–105 m) on the ige-mediated release of histamine from
human lung mast cells were investigated (figure 1).  xxxd2398xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  inhibited histamine release in a concentration-dependent manner.  xxxd2155xxx  was a full agonist and
about 10-fold more potent than  xxxd2398xxx  (table 1). the
effects of salmeterol, however, were more complex. up to
106 m, salmeterol inhibited ige-mediated histamine release

weakly (figure 1) being about two-thirds less efficacious than
either  xxxd2398xxx  or  xxxd2155xxx  (table 1). at the highest
concentration employed (105 m), salmeterol was an effective
inhibitor of histamine release (figure 1). the inhibitory
activity of salmeterol, at the highest concentration used
(105 m), was probably due to the aliphatic side chain of
salmeterol as salmeterol (105 m) and the aliphatic tail (105 m)
inhibited histamine release by 3077 and 3273%, respectively
(data not shown, n ¼ 5).
over the course of this study, salmeterol, up to concentrations of 106 m, displayed variable inhibitory activity among
mast cell preparations displaying weak effects in many
preparations. this variable inhibitory activity of salmeterol is
illustrated in figure 2.
the effects of  xxxd2398xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx , salbutamol and
salmeterol (all  xxxd1891xxx 5 m) on camp generation in mast
cells were evaluated (figure 3). the extent of camp generated
by these b-adrenoceptor agonists was isoprenalinexformoterol4salbutamol4salmeterol.

in the present study, we determined the effects of long-term

salbutamol (all  xxxd1891xxx 6 m) on the subsequent ability of

and  xxxd2155xxx  substantially compromised (po0.001) the
subsequent inhibition of histamine release by  xxxd2398xxx .
long-term treatment with salbutamol caused a less profound
but statistically significant (po0.05) reduction in the maximal
inhibitory effects of  xxxd2398xxx  (control emax, 3976%; emax

washed extensively and then incubated (10 min) with  xxxd2398xxx  (1010–105 m) before challenge with anti-ige (n ¼ 8).
there was no difference in the maximal inhibitory effect of
 xxxd2398xxx  following the treatment (control emax, 3574%;
emax after treatment, 3275%; p40.05) although there
was a modest rightward shift in the  xxxd2398xxx  concentration–response curve (control pd2, 8.070.3; pd2 after treatment, 7.770.3; p40.05). in further studies to determine
whether the aliphatic tail might facilitate desensitisation,
mast cells were incubated (24 h) with either salmeterol,
salbutamol, the aliphatic tail or the aliphatic tail plus
salbutamol (all  xxxd1891xxx 6 m), and the subsequent inhibitory
effects of  xxxd2398xxx  (106 m) determined (figure 7). the
presence of the aliphatic tail increased the desensitising
capability of salbutamol but the increase was not significantly different (p40.05) from desensitisation obtained with
salbutamol alone.
in order to establish whether long-term treatments affected
the responses to alternative camp-elevating agents, mast cells
were incubated (24 h) with either  xxxd2155xxx , salmeterol or
 xxxd2398xxx  (all  xxxd1891xxx 6 m) and then the effects of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), a receptor-mediated activator of adenylate
cyclase,  xxxd1742xxx , a direct activator of adenylate cyclase,
theophylline, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, and the badrenoceptor agonists,  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol, were
evaluated (table 2). long-term exposure of mast cells to
salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx  or  xxxd2398xxx  had no influence on the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd1742xxx  and pge2. however, long-term
treatment of mast cells with salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  (but
not  xxxd2398xxx ) reduced (po0.05) the effectiveness of
theophylline as an inhibitor of histamine release. overall,
long-term treatment of mast cells with salmeterol or  xxxd2155xxx  reduced the inhibitory effects of b-adrenoceptor agonists to
a greater extent than long-term treatment with  xxxd2398xxx .

salmeterol acting as an antagonist

table 3 effect of extensive washing on the inhibitory
activity of agonists

as salmeterol is a partial agonist in this system, the possibility
exists that the effects attributed to desensitisation reflect
salmeterol acting as an antagonist. indeed, preincubation
of mast cells with salmeterol (106 m) before incubation
with  xxxd2398xxx  (1010–105 m) caused an approximately
100-fold shift in the concentration–response curve for the
inhibition of histamine release by  xxxd2398xxx  (figure 8).
further experiments indicated that pretreatment of mast
cells with the aliphatic tail did not antagonise the  xxxd2398xxx  (1010–105 m) inhibition of histamine release (data
not shown).
in order to determine whether the inhibitory effects of
salmeterol can be removed by washing, mast cells were
incubated (20 min) with or without salmeterol (106 m) and

salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  have both been introduced as longacting bronchodilators for the therapeutic management of
asthma. both drugs act primarily to relax airway smooth
muscle and thereby provide symptomatic relief in asthma
(barnes, 1999). additional effects could include the stabilisation of pulmonary inflammatory cells and, in this context,
inhibition of mast cell responses could be important (barnes,
1999). certainly, a number of in vitro studies show that b2adrenoceptor agonists are effective inhibitors of mediator
release from lung mast cells (butchers et al., 1980; 1991;
church & hiroi, 1987; lau et al., 1994; nials et al., 1994). in
keeping with these findings,  xxxd2155xxx  was a very effective
inhibitor of the stimulated release of histamine from mast cells
being about 10-fold more potent than  xxxd2398xxx  and acting
as a full agonist. by contrast, salmeterol was about two-thirds
less efficacious as an inhibitor of histamine release and showed
highly variable inhibitory activity from preparation to
preparation. the variability in activity observed for salmeterol
may relate to differences in receptor reserve among mast cell
preparations (drury et al., 1998). the finding that  xxxd2155xxx

mast cell-enriched preparations (4877% purity) were incubated (24 h) without (control) or with a b-adrenoceptor agonist (106 m), the
cells washed three times and then membranes prepared. receptor density (bmax) was determined employing [125i]cyp and the kd values
are for this ligand. there was no difference in the kd values following the different treatments. treatment with  xxxd2155xxx  caused a
significant (po0.05) reduction in receptor density, whereas the effects of  xxxd2398xxx  and salmeterol were not statistically significant
(p40.05). values are means7s.e.m. from four experiments. the mast cell purities were 33, 44, 47 and 67%.

is both more potent and efficacious than salmeterol has also
been observed by others in mast cell systems (lau et al., 1994;
nials et al., 1994) and in alternative in vitro systems (nials
et al., 1993; kallstrom et al., 1994). these data suggest that, in
the clinical context,  xxxd2155xxx  is likely to prevent mast cell
degranulation to a greater extent than salmeterol.
as bronchodilators are thought to interact with b2adrenoceptors to activate adenylate cyclase, the effects of
salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  on the generation of total cell
camp were determined.  xxxd2155xxx  increased camp in mast
cells to a similar extent to that seen with  xxxd2398xxx  whereas
salmeterol caused very modest increases in camp that were
not statistically significant. salbutamol, which is related to
salmeterol except that it does not have the aliphatic tail, caused
increases in camp that were about 50% of that seen with
 xxxd2398xxx  and inhibited histamine release to about 60–70%
of that obtained with  xxxd2398xxx . therefore, there appears to
be a good correlation between the increases in camp induced
by these agonists and the effects of these compounds on
histamine release.
these preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol affect the responses of mast cells to substantially
different degrees. in experiments to address the comparative
effects of these two agonists on functional desensitisation in
mast cells, an expectation might be, based on the relative
efficacies of these compounds as inhibitors of histamine release
and activators of adenylate cyclase, that  xxxd2155xxx  would
promote far greater levels of desensitisation than salmeterol.
however, incubation (24 h) of mast cells with either salmeterol
or  xxxd2155xxx  substantially attenuated the inhibitory effects of
 xxxd2398xxx  and alternative b-adrenoceptor agonists. indeed,
agonists ( xxxd2398xxx  and salbutamol) with higher intrinsic
activities than salmeterol were less effective at causing the
functional desensitisation. this outcome was, perhaps, surprising given that studies in transfected cells demonstrate a
correlation between the relative efficacy of agonists and the
extent of receptor desensitisation (january et al., 1997; 1998).
that salmeterol, despite showing weak efficacy, caused
substantial levels of functional desensitisation prompted us to
determine whether the aliphatic tail might influence the
responses to mast cells. that the tail may have some effect
on mast cells is illustrated by the fact that, at high
concentrations (105 m), it inhibited histamine release to a
similar extent to that seen with salmeterol (105 m) although
these effects of both salmeterol and the tail are probably not
b2-adrenoceptor-mediated (bergendal et al., 1996; chong et al.,
1998). further studies demonstrated that long-term (24 h)
incubation of mast cells with the aliphatic tail (106 m) had no
significant effects on the inhibition by  xxxd2398xxx  of

histamine release. long-term incubation of mast cells with
salbutamol plus the aliphatic tail did appear to increase the
extent of desensitisation over that seen with salbutamol alone
but not to a statistically significant degree. thus, it is uncertain
whether the aliphatic tail makes a direct contribution to the
overall desensitising capability of salmeterol.
as salmeterol is a partial agonist in this system, the
possibility exists that the effects attributed to desensitisation
reflect salmeterol acting as an antagonist. indeed, salmeterol
has been shown to act as an antagonist to higher efficacy
agonists in a number of tissue and cell systems (dougall et al.,
1991; kallstrom et al., 1994) and similar effects were observed
in the present system. in attempts to address whether
salmeterol acts as an antagonist or induces desensitisation
following long-term treatments with salmeterol, experiments
were performed attempting to wash out salmeterol. a short
incubation (20 min) of mast cells with salmeterol followed by
thorough washing of the cells reversed the salmeterol inhibition of histamine release but not completely. it is difficult to
assess, therefore, to what extent salmeterol persists after a
longer (24 h) incubation followed by washing. perhaps the best
evidence to suggest that salmeterol is washed away effectively
after longer (24 h) incubations comes from binding studies in
which the kd of the radioligand [125i]cyp was no different in
membranes generated from control or salmeterol-treated cells.
it is probable, therefore, that the attenuation of the  xxxd2398xxx  inhibition of histamine release following long-term
incubation (24 h) of mast cells with salmeterol, followed by
extensive washing, reflects desensitisation by salmeterol of b2adrenoceptor-mediated effects rather than antagonism.
long-term treatment of mast cells with salmeterol or
 xxxd2155xxx  did not affect the responses of  xxxd1742xxx , a direct
activator of adenylate cyclase, or pge2, a receptor-mediated
activator of adenylate cyclase. the inhibitory effects of
theophylline were attenuated to a modest degree by treatments
with salmeterol or  xxxd2155xxx . overall, these data suggest that
the mechanism by which long-term treatments with salmeterol
and  xxxd2155xxx  attenuate the inhibition by b-adrenoceptor
agonists in mast cells involves effects at the b2-adrenoceptor
itself. it is probable that the functional desensitisation
observed in the present system involves receptor-related
processes such as uncoupling, sequestration or downregulation
of the b2-adrenoceptor (lefkowitz, 1998). however, it is
interesting to note that, in our studies, the extent of functional
desensitisation observed with  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol does
not correlate with the degree of b2-adrenoceptor downregulation induced by these agonists, perhaps, indicating that
processes leading to uncoupling and/or sequestration of the
receptor are more important.

an interesting aspect of the present study is that an
apparently weak partial agonist can cause extensive levels of
functional desensitisation. at equivalent concentrations
(1 mm), salmeterol, a weak inhibitor of histamine release and
a poor activator of adenylate cyclase, caused greater levels of
functional desensitisation than the full agonist  xxxd2398xxx 
(see table 2). although this comparison between  xxxd2398xxx 
and salmeterol, at equivalent concentrations, does not account
for greater occupancy of b2-adrenoceptors by salmeterol (kd,
6.7 nm) than  xxxd2398xxx  (kd, 197 nm), even if this factor is
taken into consideration (see figure 9), salmeterol still appears
to cause greater levels of functional desensitisation than
 xxxd2398xxx . this finding would suggest that agonist efficacy
is not necessarily the only factor that influences functional
desensitisation.
how relevant these studies are in the clinical context is
difficult to address. if, indeed, the system employed in the
present study is representative of mast cell responses in vivo,
then  xxxd2155xxx  is likely to be a more effective stabiliser of
mast cell degranulation than salmeterol. another consideration is the suggestion that inhalation of bronchodilators can
lead to very high (micromolar) topical concentrations of
b2-adrenoceptor agonists in the airways (anderson et al., 1994)
although other studies suggest that the concentrations attained
are lower (lipworth & clark, 1997). should concentrations of
inhaled b2-adrenoceptor agonists reach micromolar levels in
vivo then, based on data from the present study, both
salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  are likely to induce extensive
tolerance to the mast cell stabilising properties of
b2-adrenoceptor agonists. another potentially important
consideration is that should salmeterol persist in the airways
then, as well as causing desensitisation, it may act as an
antagonist to higher efficacy agonists, such as salbutamol, that
are used on an as-required basis.
in summary, the present study has shown that long-term
treatment with salmeterol or  xxxd2155xxx  causes extensive
levels of functional desensitisation to b2-adrenoceptormediated responses in mast cells. these data may have wider
