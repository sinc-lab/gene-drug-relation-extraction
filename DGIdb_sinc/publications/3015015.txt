nick and by changing the linking number by ± 1. besides
their effects on bacterial  xxxg2312xxx , both  xxxd2757xxx 
and nalidixic acid are known to inhibit eucaryotic
topoisomerases purified from hela cells (29), rat liver (8),
and embryos of drosophila melanogaster (34). the eucaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  was slightly more resistant (5-fold or
less) to inhibition by nalidixic acid and was about 1,000-fold
more resistant to inhibition by  xxxd2757xxx  than was its
bacterial counterpart (29, 30, 34).
nalidixic acid and  xxxd2757xxx  not only inhibit the enzymes modifying dna topology but also interfere with the
other elements of procaryotic and eucaryotic dna replication. nalidixic acid, e.g., alters the chainlength distribution
of replication products synthesized by the murine dna
polymerase (6). inhibition of dna polymerase from other
mammals by  xxxd2757xxx  has been reported (4, 7, 11, 24, 25,
32, 36, 42). moreover, nalidixic acid and  xxxd2757xxx  influence dna repair (5, 20, 26, 27). in e. coli, nalidixic acid is
an effective inducer of sos functions (20). studies on human
fibroblast strains demonstrated that amounts of  xxxd2757xxx 
and nalidixic acid as low as s ,ug/ml may be sufficient to
retard repair-type dna synthesis (26). so far, there are no
reports in the literature on whether the new 4-quinolones
ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin interfere with eucaryotic dna replication. hence, we tested the influence of
nalidixic acid,  xxxd2757xxx , and the new 4-quinolones on the
function of topoisomerases i and ii and on dna synthesis
by the polymerase a primase complex. the fidelity of dna
replication was determined by copying bacteriophage
4x174am16 single-stranded dna with polymerase a in vitro
(19). as an overall estimate of the influence of the 4quinolones on replicative dna synthesis, we measured the
proliferation of cells of human lymphoblastoid lines which

the nalidixic acid analogs ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and
ofloxacin are highly active bactericidal agents, effective
against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria (3, 22, 31, 37). the mics generally range between
0.01 and 10 ,ug/ml. according to the outcome of the first
clinical trials, the new 4-quinolones show promise as safe
and effective antimicrobial agents (see proc. 14th int. congr.
chemother., 1985).
the antibacterial activity of the 4-quinolones is probably
caused by the inhibition of dna synthesis (15, 35, 38, 40).
the drugs inhibit  xxxg2311xxx , a bacterial type ii
topoisomerase that negatively supercoils dna (15, 35).
according to sato et al. (k. sato, y. inoue, s. yamashita,
m. inoue, and s. mitsuhashi, proc. 14th int. congr. chemother., p. 49, 1985), ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and
ofloxacin inhibit the atp-dependent supercoiling activity
and the atp-independent relaxing activity of the dna
gyrase from escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa
at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 ,ugiml. the subunit
a of  xxxg2311xxx  is assumed to be the direct target of the
4-quinolones (15, 35); however, recently published data
provide evidence that binding to single-stranded regions of
dna may be the primary mechanism of drug action (38).
the subunit b of  xxxg2311xxx  is inhibited by  xxxd2757xxx  (15,
35).
the dna gyrases belong to the type ii topoisomerases
which alter the topology of dna by passing a dna helix
through a transient double-stranded break in another helical
structure, changing the linking number by ±+2 (15). in
contrast, the type i enzymes are able to relieve torsional
constraints in dna by making a transient single-stranded

the influence of ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin,  xxxd2757xxx , and ofloxacin on elements of
eucaryotic dna replication was investigated in vitro. each of the 4-quinolones, when present in amounts of
more than 100 ,ig/mi, reversibly inhibited the dna synthesis performed by the 9s dna polymerase a primase
complex from calf thymus.  xxxd2757xxx  at 500 glg/ml or at higher concentrations irreversibly inactivated dna
polymerase a primase complex. the accuracy of in vitro dna synthesis in the absence of repair mechanisms
was determined from amber-revertant assays with 4x174aml6(+) dna as template. the antimicrobial agents
did not significantly increase the frequencies of base pairing mismatches during the course of replication,
indicating that the basal mutation rate is not affected by  xxxd2757xxx  and the 4-quinolones. the ki values of 50%
inhibition of dna topoisomerases from calf thymus by ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin,  xxxd2757xxx , nalidixic acid,
and ofloxacin were 300, 400, 1,000 or more, 1,000 or more, and 1,500 or more ,ug/ml, respectively, in the case
of topoisomerase i, and the ki values were 150, 300, 500, 1,000, and 1,300 ,ug/ml, respectively, in the case of
 xxxg2312xxx . the procaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  is approximately 100-fold more sensitive to inhibition by
ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin than is its eucaryotic counterpart. growth curves of lymphoblasts
were recorded in the presence of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. neither 1 nor 10 ,ug of ciprofloxacin or of ofloxacin
per ml affected cell proliferation. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at 100 ,ug/mi inhibited cell growth; 1,000 gig/mi
led to cell death. no correlation exists between the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the 4-quinolones.

and dried. the acid-precipitated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
amber-revertant assays. the principle of the amberrevertant assay has been described previously (12, 45). to
determine the basal mutation rate in the absence of repair

mechanisms, the dna of the amber mutant aml6 of the
bacteriophage 4~x174 is copied by the dna polymerase a
primase complex in vitro, and the dna is expressed in vivo
to produce progeny. the accuracy of dna replication is
measured by scoring the proportion of revertants to amber
stock in the progeny.
preparation of spheroplasts. a 100-ml amount of l broth
supplemented with 0.4 mg of vitamin b1 was inoculated with
2.5 ml of an overnight culture of e. coli c600. cells were
grown in an orbital shaker at 37°c and were harvested in the
logarithmic phase by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 x g). the
pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of 30% (vol/vol) bsa and 1 ml
of 1.5 m sucrose. after the addition of 50 ,ul of lysozyme (2
mg/ml in 250 mm tris hydrochloride [ph 7.8]) and 200 ri of
4% (vol/vol) edta, the suspension was incubated for 2 min
at room temperature. subsequently, 17.8 ml of pa medium,
made up of 10% sucrose, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% (vol/vol)
casamino acids (difco), was added slowly. after another 12
min, 0.3 ml of 10%  xxxd2534xxx , 37.5 ,li of 1% (vol/vol) protamine
sulfate, and 50 ,ul of  xxxd3234xxx  chloride (250 mg/ml) were
added, and the spheroplast preparation was put on ice. after
3 h, the spheroplasts were competent for the uptake of phage
dna.
replication and transfection. 40x174am16(+) dna was
replicated in a 50-pu reaction mixture for 90 min at 37°c by
dna polymerase a in the presence of  xxxd2757xxx  or 4quinolones as described above. dna was precipitated by
the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m
ammonium acetate. after 20 min of incubation at -80°c, the
sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 4°c in an eppendorf
centrifuge. the pellet was lyophilized and dissolved in 50 pi
of 10 mm tris hydrochloride [ph 7.81-1 mm edta. a
of 10 pul, in the case of the progeny-revertant assay,
portion p1
and 10 of a 103- to 104-fold dilution, in the case of the
progeny-expression assay, were mixed with 0.4 ml of 50 mm
tris hydrochloride [ph 8.11-1 mm edta and then with 0.4
ml of the spheroplast suspension. after 10 min of incubation
at 30°c, the spheroplasts were mixed with 2.5 ml of prewarmed ltas soft agar (45°c) and 250 p1 of a suspension of
indicator bacteria in logarithmic phase. the mixture was
plated immediately on l agar. the supf strain of e. coli cq2
was used for the expression of unchanged progenies, and the
wild-type strain of e. coli c was used for the expression of
revertants. plaques were scored for e. coli cq2 plates after
4 h of incubation at 37°c, and plaques were scored for e. coli
after 8 h of incubation at 30°c.
assays of dna topoisomerases i and ii. the purification
procedures for dna topoisomerases i and ii from calf
thymus will be published separately. the enzyme preparations were free of proteases, nucleases, and dna polymerases.  xxxg2312xxx  was purified to near homogeneity
and was not contaminated by topoisomerase i activity.

the activity of topoisomerase i in the presence and
absence of 4-quinolones or  xxxd2757xxx  was assayed by
measurement of the relaxation of supercoiled doublestranded dna in the absence of atp and mg2+ ions. the

contained in addition 0.72 g of bacto-agar (difco laboratories) per liter and 15 g of l agar per liter. ltas soft agar was
supplemented with 10% sucrose, 1% (vol/vol) bsa, and 10
mm cacl2. strain cq2 was host for phage 4~x174aml6 (12,
13), and strain jm103 was host for phage m13mp7.
dna substrates. activated dna as template primer was
obtained by the digestion of 100 mg of calf thymus dna in
40 ml of a 5 mm mgcl2-10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.8) mixture
with 125 ,ug of dnase for 15 min at 37°c. the reaction was
stopped by subsequent incubation at 77°c for 5 min and then
at 65°c for 10 min (2). single-stranded xx174am16(+) and
m13mp7(+) dnas were prepared from  xxxd2982xxx 
precipitates by the method of yamamoto et al. (47). the
double-stranded supercoiled replicative form i (rfi), of
4x174am16 was isolated from 6- to 8-h fermentations of
phage-infected e. coli cq2 cells in the presence of chloramphenicol (17). the dna substrates were more than 99% pure
as checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.
dna synthesis assays. calf thymus dna polymerase a
primase complex (9s enzyme) was prepared to a specific
activity of 50,000 u/mg as described previously (18). one
unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the
incorporation of 1 nmol of  xxxd3365xxx  per h at 37°c with activated
dna as template primer. the dna synthesis assays each
(50 pal) contained 20 mm tris acetate (ph 7.2), 75 mm
 xxxd2987xxx , 5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.1 mg of bsa per
ml, 0.1 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and various
concentrations of antimicrobial agents. when activated
dna was used, the initial rate of dna synthesis was
measured by incubation of the assay mixture for 10 min at
37°c in the presence of 0.5 mg of dna per ml and 100 u of
dna polymerase ot primase complex per ml. for the replication of single-stranded phage dna, each assay mixture
was supplemented with ribonucleotides (1 mm atp, 0.1 mm
ctp, 0.1 mm gtp, and 0.1 mm utp) as substrates for
the primase activity of dna polymerase a. replication of
m13mp7(+) (10 pug/ml) was performed with 100 u of
dna polymerase a per ml (90 min, 37°c); replication of
4x174am16(+) (20 pugiml) was performed with 300 u of
enzyme per ml (90 mim, 37°c). the incorporation of nucleotides was followed by inclusion of [a-32p] xxxd1148xxx  into the
assay mixture. after incubation, a portion was pipetted onto
a whatman gf/c filter disk. the filter disk was incubated for
10 min in ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% [vol/vol], 10 mm

results
dna synthesis assays. with activated dna as template
primer, the dna synthesis by the 9s dna polymerase a
primase complex from calf thymus was measured in the
presence of 0, 10, 33, 100, 333, and 1,000 ,ug of 4-quinolones
per ml. a significant decrease in the amount of synthesized
dna was only observed with drug concentrations of more
than 100 ,ug/ml (fig. 1). an amount of 1 mg/ml significantly
reduced the activity of dna polymerase a by about 20% in
the case of ofloxacin, by approximately 60% in the case of
nalidixic acid and norfloxacin, and by more than 80% in the
case of ciprofloxacin. this inhibition of dna polymerase a
primase complex was reversible. dilution of the reaction
mixture with buffer restored the initial enzyme activity.
control experiments with various amounts of dmso revealed that 10% (vol/vol) dmso in the assay had no influence on dna synthesis and the accuracy of dna replication.
in agreement with data from the literature (11, 42),
 xxxd2757xxx  was found to be an effective inhibitor of dna
polymerase a primase complex. taking a 100-,ug/ml concentration of activated dna as template, the enzymatic activity
linearly decreased from 100% to nearly zero in the narrow
concentration range from 0.4 to 0.8 mg of  xxxd2757xxx  per ml.
concentrations of activated dna of more than 10 ,ug/ml
reduced the enzymatic activity by about 20% per added 100
,ug/ml (substrate inhibition). assays with m13mp7(+) dna
as a template of definite length and sequence yielded the
same result. measurements of the michaelis-menten kinetics
of dna synthesis as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration revealed that with increasing  xxxd2757xxx  concentration the km and vmax values decreased. thus,  xxxd2757xxx  did

agents for 30 min at 37°c. the reaction mixture contained 1
,ug of protein per ml of topoisomerase i preparation with a
specific activity of 2 x 107 u/mg. one unit was defined as the
amount of enzyme required to achieve complete relaxation
of 0.5 ,ug of supercoiled 4x174 dna in 15 min at 37°c. the
products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis as
described in the next paragraph.
 xxxg2312xxx  activity was assayed by the catenation
of double-stranded supercoiled dna in the presence of
histone hi, atp, and mg21 ions. the catenation can only be
observed in a narrow concentration range of histone hi, and
hence the optimum amount of hi in the assay was determined separately for each enzyme preparation and enzyme
concentration. the reaction was performed in a 20-,ul volume containing 100 mm tris hydrochloride (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm
edta, 5 mm mgcl2, 50 mm nacl, 50 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
p- xxxd26xxx , 2 mm atp, 30 ,ug of bsa per ml, 50 ,ug
of supercoiled double-stranded dna (4)x174am16 rf1) per
ml, about 8 to 12 ,ug of histone hi per ml, 5 u of homogeneous  xxxg2312xxx  preparations, and various concentrations of antimicrobial agents dissolved in 10% (vol/vol)
dmso. the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37°c, and
the products were separated on a neutral agarose gel. one
unit of  xxxg2312xxx  activity was defined as the amount
of enzyme required to achieve complete catenation of 0.5 ,ug
of supercoiled q)x174 dna in 1 h at 37°c. the specific
activities of the  xxxg2312xxx  preparations varied between 5 x 105 and 2 x 106 u/mg of protein, which leads to an
enzyme concentration of approximately 0.7 nm in the assay.
under the chosen experimental conditions,  xxxg2312xxx 
catalyzed both the catenation and the relaxation of
supercoiled dna, and, accordingly, the two products of
catenated and relaxed rings were always observed. the
homogeneous  xxxg2312xxx  preparations did not contain
any nicking activity.
for both topoisomerases i and ii, the 50% inhibition of
relaxation and catenation was determined visually from
repetitive titrations narrowing the concentration range of
drug from titration to titration.
agarose gel electrophoresis. neutral agarose gels were
prepared as horizontal slabs from a solution of 1% agarose in
90 mm tris phosphate (ph 8.3)-5 mm sodium acetate-2 mm
edta. the loading buffer contained 250 mm edta (ph
8.2), 0.2% sodium  xxxd3215xxx , 0.1% bromphenol blue,
and 25% sucrose. samples were prepared for electrophoresis
by the addition of s ,ul of loading buffer to 10 f±l of the
respective reaction mixture. electrophoresis was performed
at 80 ma for 1 to 3 h. the gel was stained with ethidium
bromide (5 ,ug/ml), and the dna was visualized with a uv
lamp at 256 nm.
lymphoblastoid cell lines and cell culture. the lymphoblast
cell lines hsc49, hsc50, hsc89, hsc92, and hsc93 were
derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes by the method of
glade and broder (16). cells were grown in alpha medium
(41) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum without antibiotics. the cultures were maintained at 37°c in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% c02, and the culture medium was
changed twice a week.
growth inhibition experiments. lymphoblasts (1.5 x 104)
were seeded in 0.3-ml aliquots into each well of a 96-well
plate (becton dickinson labware). cells were grown in the
absence or presence of various concentrations of ofloxacin
or ciprofloxacin. cell viability, defined by the exclusion of a
0.4% (wt/vol) aqueous trypan blue solution, and cell number
were determined at 24-h intervals in a hemacytometer over a
period of 7 days. the sensitivity of a cell line was defined as

all the values are corrected for mismatch repair and minus-strand expression

presence of mn2+ was initiated with the haeiii fragment h1sa of xx174 (19).

growth curves of lymphoblasts in the presence of ofloxacin
and ciprofloxacin. the growth of the cell lines was defined by
cell number and viability. samples were taken during the
stage of the onset of growth, during the exponential growth
phase, and in the late-logarithmic phase. low amounts of
ofloxacin, 1 or 10 ,ug/ml, delayed the onset of growth in vitro
by 1 to 2 days without affecting cell viability. ciprofloxacin
at 1 and 10 fg/ml had no effect on cell proliferation when
compared with controls. ofloxacin at 100 ,ug/ml slightly
inhibited cell growth by about 20% (statistically not significant). ciprofloxacin at 100 jig/ml inhibited cell growth completely. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at 1 mg/ml induced the
cell death of lymphoblasts.

discussion
the purpose of this study was to discover whether the
recently developed nalidixic acid analogs interfere with
elements of eucaryotic dna replication. our data demonstrate that the 4-quinolone antimicrobial agents are able to
inhibit mammalian dna polymerase ot primase complex and
dna topoisomerases i and ii. however, amounts of at least
50 ,ug of drug per ml were needed before an inhibitory effect
on the function of the eucaryotic enzymes could be observed.
interestingly, no correlation exists between the antimicrobial activity of a drug and its cytotoxic ability to inhibit
eucaryotic dna replication. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are
the most active antibacterial agents within the series of drugs
investigated. our in vitro assays revealed that ciprofloxacin
is the most potent inhibitor of the topoisomerases and
polymerase a and that ofloxacin is the weakest inhibitor of
these mammalian enzymes.

not act as a reversible competitive or noncompetitive inhibitor. when the reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min
with the completely inhibiting  xxxd2757xxx  concentration of 1
mglml and subsequently diluted with buffer to less-inhibiting
concentrations of 0.5 or 0.25 mg/ml, the enzymatic activity
was not restored. we conclude that  xxxd2757xxx  irreversibly
inactivates mammalian dna polymerase a primase complex.
accuracy of dna polymerase a primase complex in the
presence of the antimicrobial agents. the error rates of dna
replication were analyzed by amber-revertant assays. the
90-min incubation with dna polymerase a primase complex
at 37°c yielded mainly the complete double-stranded relaxed
circle of 4)x174 (rfii) and some linear double-stranded
rfiii as by-product. in some assays, nalidixic acid led to
overreplication, indicating strand-displacement synthesis.
the misinsertion frequency at the amber codon was determined to be in the range of 10-4 to 10-5. the presence of
4-quinolones or  xxxd2757xxx  had no significant influence on
the mean error rate of the dna polymerase a primase
complex (table 1). as a positive control of the assay, the
obligatory cation mg2+ was substituted by 1 mm mutagenic
cation mn2 . in the presence of manganese ions, a 10-fold
decrease of accuracy was observed. this result is in accordance with data obtained by kunkel and loeb (23) with the
4x174am3-revertant assay and dna polymerase i.
inhibition of eucaryotic dna topoisomerases i and ii by
 xxxd2757xxx  and 4-quinolones.  xxxd2757xxx , nalidixic acid, and
ofloxacin had no effect on the eucaryotic topoisomerase i
from calf thymus in the concentration range of 1 to 1,000
,ug/ml. on the other hand, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin
were found to be inhibitors of topoisomerase i. the k1
values of 50% inhibition by these drugs were determined to
be between 300 and 400 jig/ml (table 2). norfloxacin or

ciprofloxacin at 100 jig/ml was sufficient to resolve the
various intermediate topoisomers of the incomplete relaxation of supercoiled dna in the agarose gel (fig. 2).
 xxxg2312xxx  from calf thymus was more strongly
affected by the antibiotics than was topoisomerase i. the k,
values of 50% inhibition varied within one order of magnitude, between 150 and 1,300 p.g/ml for the various drugs
(table 2). amounts of less than 50 ,ug/ml were found to be
noninhibitory for  xxxg2312xxx . the variation of the ph
of the stock solution of the antimicrobial agent between 6
and 8 had no influence on the results. the potency of
inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx  increased in the order
ofloxacin < nalidixic acid <  xxxd2757xxx  < norfloxacin <
ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin and nalidixic acid were found to be
weak inhibitors. only high concentrations of antibiotic,
more than 1 mg/ml, induced the occurrence of intermediate
topoisomers. a 10% concentration of dmso (vol/vol) in the
assays did not influence the activity of topoisomerases i and
ii.

fig. 2. relaxation of supercoiled double-stranded 4x174am16 dna (rfi) by topoisomerase i in the presence of  xxxd2757xxx  or
4-quinolones. lanes: 1,povobiocin (1 mg/ml); 2, nalidixic acid (1 mg/ml); 3, ofloxacin (1 mg/ml); 4, norfloxacin (1 mg/ml); 5, control (rfi and
rfii of 4x174am16); 6, control (no antimicrobial agent); 7, ciprofloxacin (1 mg/ml); 8, ciprofloxacin (0.67 mg/ml); 9, ciprofloxacin (0.33
mg/ml); 10, ciprofloxacin (0.1 mg/ml); 11, ciprofloxacin (0.01 mg/ml).

the 4-quinolones only slightly affected dna synthesis by
dna polymerase a primase complex from calf thymus.
even in the presence of 1 mg of drug per ml, dna synthesis
was only reduced by 20 to 80%. the ability of nalidixic acid
to inhibit dna polymerase a primase complex is comparable to its ability to inhibit eucaryotic aminoacyl-trna
synthetases (46).
the amber-revertant assays revealed that  xxxd2757xxx  and
the 4-quinolones do not impair the accuracy of dna polymerase a pnmase complex. because the test measures the
basal mutation rates of eucaryotic dna replication in vitro
in the absence of repair mechanisms, it may represent a
useful supplement to the common tests of mutagenicity. the
only practical disadvantage is its requirement of a pure dna

polymerase preparation.
dna topoisomerases are essential for the function of
eucaryotic cells (9, 10, 14, 33, 43, 44, 48). the inhibition of
these enzymes would be an undesirable side effect of antimicrobial therapy with 4-quinolones. however, the ki values are relatively high. the minimum concentration to

the standard deviation of the ec50 values of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin
was determined to be about 30%. the values were determined from growth

inhibit  xxxg2312xxx  in vitro was determined to be about
50 ,ug/ml. table 2 presents the ki values of 50% inhibition of
procaryotic and eucaryotic dna  xxxg2312xxx  by the
4-quinolones. the selectivity of nalidixic acid between the
bacterial enzyme and its eucaryotic counterpart is poor; the
ki values are within the same order of magnitude. however,
in the cases of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin,'and norfloxacin, the
procaryotic type ii topoisomerase is about two orders of
magnitude more sensitive to inhibition by the 4-quinolones
than is the eucaryotic enzyme.
the cell growth of lymphoblasts was inhibited 50% by
ciprofloxacin concentrations of approximately 100 pum or
ofloxacin concentrations of 300 ,um. these ec50 values are
high compared with dna-modifying drugs which are known
to be cytotoxic for eucaryotic cells (table 3). the same
lymphoblast cell lines were about 10-fold more sensitive to
the nitrosourea compound 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-nnitrosourea and about 100- to 1,000-fold more sensitive to
dna-cross-linking agents ( xxxd1709xxx ,  xxxd2655xxx  c,
 xxxd2562xxx ) and to the monofunctional  xxxd3249xxx  nmethyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (21). our ec50 values of
ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin for lymphoblasts are comparable
to the data reported by m. negishi, c. young, and h. suzuki
(proc. 14th int. congr. chemother., p. 129, 1985) for the
inhibition of c57bl mouse bone marrow cells as
hemopoietic stem cells by ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and nalidixic acid.
