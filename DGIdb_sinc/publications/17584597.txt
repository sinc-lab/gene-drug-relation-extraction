abstract
the  xxxg1174xxx  alpha chain (il-2ra, cd25) plays a major part in shaping the dynamics of t cell populations following immune
activation, due to its role in t cell proliferation and survival. strategies to blunt the effector responses in transplantation have been developed by
devising pharmaceutical agents to block the il-2 pathways. however, such strategies could adversely affect the cd25+foxp3+t regulatory (t reg)
populations which also rely on intereukin-2 signaling for survival. the present study shows that a cohort of heart allograft recipients treated with
 xxxd1798xxx  (a humanized anti-cd25 antibody) display foxp3 expression patterns consistent with functional t regulatory cell populations. high
levels of foxp3 were observed to correlate with lower incidence of and recovery from acute rejection, as well as lower levels of anti-donor hla
antibody production. therefore, t reg populations appear fully functional in patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx , even when 5 doses were
administered. by comparison, patients treated with fewer doses or no  xxxd1798xxx  had a higher incidence of acute rejection, antibody production and
graft failure. therefore, our data indicates that  xxxd1798xxx  treatment does not interfere with the generation of regulatory t cells and has a beneficial
effect on heart allograft survival.

1. introduction
the use of calcineurin inhibitors as part of standard immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplantation has resulted in a
remarkable increase in the rate of allograft survival. the
additional use of various monoclonal ( xxxd2676xxx ) and polyclonal
(antithymocytic/lymphocytic) antibodies (as depletional induction agents) has further contributed to prevention of early
episodes of acute rejection [1]. however, the risk of infection,
malignancy and late rejection remains a looming concern. more
recently, a new generation of immunosuppressive agents has
been introduced to fine tune t cell responses by specifically

targeting activated t cells. the humanized anti-cd25 monoclonal antibody ( xxxd1798xxx , zenapax®, hoffmann-la roche) is
such an example. its efficacy in conjunction with triple
immunosuppression has been documented in several studies
[1–4].
the underlying hypothesis for the development of this drug
has been that blocking of the  xxxg1174xxx  may prevent
the proliferation and differentiation of effector t cells. however,
studies in the field of regulatory t cells have shown that cd25
represents a crucial marker of foxp3+ t cells with suppressor
function [5–12]. in the light of this data, the obvious question is
whether anti-cd25 treatment results in the blockade or depletion
of regulatory t cells and whether quiescence can be attained in
their absence. to answer this question we have performed serial
determinations of markers deemed to be characteristic of regulatory/suppressor t cells (treg/ts), such as foxp3, ctla-4,

and il-10, in a cohort of 110 heart recipients transplanted between 2003 and 2006 (table 1). as putative markers for rejection
we used  xxxg1141xxx  and vegf. in addition, given the fact that
development of anti-donor hla antibodies is detrimental to the
graft we monitored such antibodies in patients' sera. we now
report on the positive correlation between quiescence and
expression of these treg markers in peripheral blood cd4+and
cd8+ t cells, demonstrating that the development of regulatory
t cells is not impaired in patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx . such
regulatory t cells were negatively associated with the occurrence of early acute rejection episodes and development of
alloantibodies [13–15].
2. material and methods
2.1. patients
110 heart allograft recipients (84 males and 26 females) with a mean age of
49.4 years (49.4 ± 13.0 s.d., range 18–72) were recruited for these studies at the
time of transplantation. the demographic of this study population is shown in
table 1. all patients gave informed consent under the auspices of the appropriate
institutional review board. patients were treated with cyclosporine (csa),
 xxxd2677xxx  (mmf), prednisone (mp) and with or without
 xxxd1798xxx  (administered at 1 mg/kg body weight).

1b), multifocal aggressive infiltrates with myocyte damage (grade 3a), diffuse
inflammatory process with necrosis (grade 3b) and diffuse aggressive polymorpho/mononuclear infiltrate with edema, hemorrhage, vasculitis and necrosis
(grade 4) [16].
a baseline angiogram was performed within one month of transplantation to
detect unsuspected vascular disease. angiograms were repeated annually. the
diagnosis of cav was made when contrast angiography demonstrated diffused
small vessel involvement, defined as concentric and symmetrical narrowing of
terminal branches.

2.3. molecular hla typing and testing of anti-hla antibodies
hla genotypes of transplant recipient/donor pairs were determined by pcr
with sequence specific primers (ssp) using commercially available kits (one
lambda, los angeles, ca). sequential samples of sera obtained from each
patient prior to and following transplantation were tested for anti-hla
alloantibodies by lymphocytotoxicity and solid-phase assays to determine the
frequency of panel reactive antibodies (pra). the specificity of the antibodies
for the donor's hla antigens was assessed by screening and direct crossmatching procedures as previously described [17].

2.4. lymphocyte growth assay
a biopsy fragment (1 mm3 piece) was placed in medium supplemented with
recombinant il-2 (5 units/ml) and examined microscopically at 48 h. growth
was scored on a semi quantitative scale from 0 to 3 on the basis of circumferential
t cell aggregation. a score of 1 or greater was deemed positive [18].

2.2. endomyocardial biopsies (emb)
2.5. quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr
endomyocardial biopsies were performed by the standard transjugular
approach weekly for the first month and then at progressively longer intervals to a
baseline schedule of every 6 months. the mean number of biopsies per patient
was 10 ± 2. a minimum of four biopsy fragments were fixed in 4% buffered
formalin, paraffin embedded, and multiple hematoxylin and eosin stained
sections from the three levels in the block were examined. an additional fragment
was frozen for rt-pcr and lymphocyte growth assays (lga). histological
grades were assigned according to the criteria of the international society for
heart and lung transplantation (ishlt): no rejection (grade 0), focal (grade 1a)
or diffuse interstitial mononuclear infiltrates without myocyte necrosis (grade

a total of 508 peripheral blood samples from 110 transplant patients were
tested by qrt-pcr for expression of various genes at the transcriptional level.
cd4 and cd8 cells were isolated from each of these samples by use of
commercially available magnetic isolation kits (miltenyi biotec, gladbach,
germany). additionally, qrt-pcr studies of were performed on 104 emb
samples. biopsies were stored overnight at 4 °c in 5 volumes of rnalater tissue
collection/rna stabilization solution (ambion, foster city, california). after
removal of the rna stabilization solution biopsies were stored at − 80 °c for
subsequent rna extraction.
total rna was isolated from biopsies with the rnaqueous-4pcr kit
(ambion) following the manufacturer's recommendations. complementary
cdna was synthesized using the 1st strand cdna synthesis kit for rt-pcr
(roche diagnostics, basel, switzerland). quantitative real-time pcr was performed using taqman gene expression assays (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca). the gene expression assays used in these studies are identified below, by
gene name, manufacturer's abbreviation and part number: cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen 4 (ctla-4, hs00175480_m1),  xxxg813xxx  (foxp3,
hs00203958_m1),  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ,
4326317e),  xxxg1161xxx  (il-10, hs00174086_m1), interferon-gamma
( xxxg1141xxx , hs00174143_m1), and  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf,
hs00173626_m1) all from applied biosystems. forward and reverse primers
are contained in different exons, to prevent amplification of genomic dna. we
used the 7300 rt-pcr instrument (applied biosystems), applying the manufacturer's protocols and recommended amplification conditions, as follows:
one cycle at 50 °c (2 min), then 95 °c (10 min), followed by 50 cycles at 95 °c
(15 s) and 60 °c (1 min). data were collected and analyzed using the 7300 sds
1.3.1 software (applied biosystems). each assay plate included “no template”
negative controls and a control cdna. the relative amount of gene expression
was calculated according to the formula: 2− deltact, where deltact = [ct(gene) − ct
( xxxg861xxx )] and ct is the “crossing threshold” value returned by the pcr
instrument for every gene amplification.

2.6. statistical analysis
the generalized estimating equation (gee) approach with working independence was used to study the association between two variables. two gee
modeling approaches were used, one with constant intercept and the other with

different intercept term for each subject. the identity link was used for continuous variables, while the logit link was used for rejection, which is binary.
time to death was used as the end point in overall graft survival analysis, and
patients who were alive were censored at the date of last clinical contact. the
cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis of
 xxxd1798xxx  treatment. overall graft survival was computed using kaplan–
meier product–limit estimators and compared by log rank tests. the influence
of  xxxd1798xxx  treatment on the development of anti-hla antibodies was
evaluated by kaplan–meier estimators, with p values obtained using log rank
statistics. for categorical variables, a 2 × 2 table was constructed and compared
by either chi-square analysis or fisher's exact (2-tail) test. a non-parametric
wilcoxon exact test was used for analysis of changes in the level of foxp3
expression in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from patients with resolving acute rejection episodes. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. all statistical tests were 2-sided. statistical analysis of data was performed using the
sas version 9.1 software package (sas institute, cary, nc) [19,20].

analysis of peripheral blood samples showed a negative correlation
between the level of foxp3 expression in cd4+ t cells and emb
grade 3a (p = 0.025, fig. 1) rejection episodes.
although within the cd8 compartment the level of foxp3 expression was 5-fold higher during quiescence compared to high-grade
rejection, the difference did not reach significance (p n 0.296).
similarly, analysis of foxp3 expression in biopsy tissue (n = 103)
showed a negative association with the grade of rejection which did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.416). however, the consistent trend
for high expression of foxp3 in peripheral blood and biopsies during
quiescence and low expression during episodes of acute rejection
suggests that regulatory t cells play a role in allotransplantation.

3. results

resolving rejections were defined as lymphocytic infiltrates grade 3a
emb subsiding to grade 1 or 0 within 1 week. we examined the expression of foxp3 in peripheral blood tcells from 9 such cases. in one of
these 9 cases, the cd4+ t cells were not testable for technical reasons. of
particular note was the finding that the level of foxp3 expression
went from low levels to higher values during resolving rejection. thus, in
7/8 rejection episodes, the level of foxp3 in peripheral blood cd4 t
cells increased 7-fold (p = 0.036) during the resolving rejection. similarly,
peripheral cd8 t cells showed a 13-fold increase (p = 0.028), in 9/9 cases
of resolving rejection (fig. 2).
an exception seemed to occur in a patient who showed low foxp3
(in both cd4 and cd8 peripheral cells) in conjunction with emb grade
3a, followed one week later by a 10-fold decrease in the level of
foxp3 as rejection appeared to resolve to grade 1 emb. this patient,
however, showed a second episode of rejection grade 3, two weeks
after the first grade 3 episode (fig. 3) consistent with the low level of
foxp3 seen at the time when emb showed only grade 1b infiltrates.

3.1. expression of foxp3 in cd4 and cd8 t cells from the peripheral
blood of heart allograft recipients
regulatory t cells are characterized by their capacity to suppress
the reactivity of other effector populations of antigen-stimulated
t cells. several distinct populations of regulatory t cells, such as
thymus-derived cd4+cd25+foxp3+natural t reg [5,6], antigeninduced cd4+cd25+foxp3+peripheral t reg [7–9], il-10-producing cd4+cd25+foxp3-tr1 [10,11], cd8+foxp3+ts [8,9,21–23]
and cd8+il-10-producing ts [12] have been shown to play a role in
human transplantation and experimental models [8]. to assess the
presence of t reg in human allotransplantation, we analyzed the
expression of foxp3 in peripheral cd4 and cd8 t cell populations
(n = 508) as well as in heart allograft biopsies (n = 1557). emb grade
3a or higher was considered indicative of acute cellular rejection [16].

3.2. the dynamic of foxp3 expression in peripheral blood t cells
during resolving rejection

fig. 2. the dynamic of foxp3 expression in peripheral t cells during resolving rejection.

the finding that during recurrent rejection the level of foxp3 expression in peripheral blood t cells stays at a low value reinforces the
concept that foxp3 is associated with t regulatory cells that may play
a role in protecting the graft.
3.3. foxp3 associations with the expression of other markers of t cell
function
ctla-4 negatively regulates the classical costimulation pathways
required for efficient t cell activation. this molecule is highly
expressed by both cd4 and cd8 regulatory t cells [6,17,18]). there is
also evidence that  xxxg1161xxx  mediates the suppressor function of
several types of regulatory t cells [8,10–12]. because different
populations of regulatory t cells may be simultaneously present in the
circulation [24,25], we analyzed the relationship between the level of
expression of foxp3 and that of these suppressor markers in cd4 and
cd8 cells from sequential samples of blood. we found a significant
correlation between the level of expression of foxp3 and ctla-4 as
well as foxp3 and il-10, irrespective of rejection status (table 2).
no association between the level of expression of foxp3 and that of
 xxxg1141xxx  in cd4 and cd8 t cells from the circulation of transplant patients
was found during quiescence or rejection (gee test, p values n 0.05,
table 2).
studies of emb tissue showed no significant relationships between the level of expression of foxp3, il-10, ctla-4 or  xxxg1141xxx 
(p values n 0.05). this most likely reflects the fact that within the
emb tissue, infiltrating t cells represent only a small fraction of the cell
sample. unexpectedly however, there was a significant correlation
between the levels of expression of foxp3 and vegf (p = 0.007,
table 2). this observation was unexpected because vegf, a factor active

in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth, was
previously shown to be increased in allograft rejection [26].
3.4. foxp3 is inversely related to the production of anti-donor hla
antibodies
the generation, differentiation, and maturation of antibody producing b cells are highly dependent on t cell help. such help can be

provided via the production of th2-type cytokines, or by direct t–b
interaction [27]. by inhibiting th, t reg can interfere with b cell
proliferation and differentiation into ig secreting plasma cells, [28,29]
and reviewed in ref. [8]. to determine whether the presence of t reg
may affect the antibody status of the patients, we analyzed the
relationship between the level of foxp3 expression in cd4 and cd8
t cells and the presence of anti-hla (igg) antibodies in the patients'
circulation. this analysis revealed a negative correlation between
high levels of foxp3 in the cd4 compartment and the development
of anti-hla igg antibodies (p = 0.014, fig. 4a). patients developing
high pra following transplantation also showed low expression of
foxp3 in cd8 t cells. however, this correlation was not statistically
significant (p = 0.976, fig. 4). these findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that regulatory t cells suppress the activation and differentiation of alloantibody producing b cells, either directly or acting
on allospecific t helper cells.

3.5. relationship between  xxxd1798xxx  treatment and immune responses
against the graft
within this study cohort of 110 patients, 7 were not treated with
 xxxd1798xxx . all 7 patients showed an early, post-transplantation
“spike” of anti-hla ab. in three recipients this phenomenon was
transient, although the patients remained prone to subsequent sporadic,
short-term bouts of anti-hla antibodies as late as one year after
transplantation (fig. 5a, b, c). in the remaining four patients not
receiving treatment with  xxxd1798xxx  anti-hla antibodies persisted in
the circulation over the entire period of observation as illustrated in
fig. 5d. the anti-donor-hla specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by a direct cross match of the patients' sera with t cells and
b cells from the specific donor spleens.
study of patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx  showed that only 42% of
the patients that have received 4 or more doses developed anti-hla
antibodies within 24 months post-transplantation, compared to 69% and
100% of those who received 1–3 doses or no  xxxd1798xxx , respectively
(p b 0.0001) (fig. 5e, f). thus, it appears that the activation of the
humoral arm of the immune response against the graft was inhibited by
 xxxd1798xxx  in a dose related manner.
we analyzed the frequency of emb grade 3a or higher in our cohort
of patients, after completion of the  xxxd1798xxx  treatment course.
patients receiving more than 3 doses had a significantly lower incidence
of emb grade 3a rejection compared to patients receiving 0–3 doses
(p b 0.04, fig. 6). acute rejection (emb grade 3+) was strongly associated with positive lga results which reflect the growth capacity of
graft infiltrating cells and their implicitly aggressive nature (p b 0.0001,
fig. 7). this data indicates that  xxxd1798xxx  inhibits both the cellular
and humoral immune response against the graft.
3.6. effect of  xxxd1798xxx  treatment on patient survival
among patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx  (n = 103), 73.6% received
5 courses of the drug while the remaining 25.4% received lesser
amounts. the cox proportionate hazards model shows that  xxxd1798xxx 
had a protective effect against graft loss, and that this effect was dosage

dependent. thus, receiving three  xxxd1798xxx  doses or less exposes a
patient to 4.3-fold higher risk of graft loss compared to patients receiving four or more treatments (fig. 8a, b). patients receiving five or
more doses of  xxxd1798xxx  showed the same (about 4-fold) protection
from graft loss as those receiving 4 doses, suggesting no further benefit
from additional doses. the 12-month actuarial heart allograft survival
was 82% among patients receiving 0–3 doses of  xxxd1798xxx  and 96%
among those receiving more (fig. 8c, d).

4. discussion
over the last decade, the literature has been dominated by the
concept that regulatory t cells which have the cd4+cd25+
foxp3+ phenotype are crucially important to the maintenance
of tolerance to self and non-self antigens [5–8]. studies in
rodents have demonstrated unambiguously that this population
of regulatory t cells is primarily responsible for protecting the
animal from autoimmune diseases [5–8,30,31]. evidence
that both cd4+ and cd8+ foxp3+ t cells mediate allogeneic
tolerance has also been provided by numerous studies in rodents
[30,32,33].
in spite of the large body of information about the capacity of
t reg to inhibit t cell responses in malignancy [34,35] and
certain autoimmune diseases, the data regarding their mechanism of action and clinical significance is still controversial. the

controversy emerges primarily from the finding that in human
cd25, foxp3 and ctla-4 are markers which are shared by
treg with a stable phenotype and by ‘transient’ regulatory t cells
which represent only a stage in the differentiation of activated t
cells [36,37]. the promiscuity of foxp3 expression in activated
human t cells may explain our finding that foxp3 and  xxxg1141xxx 
showed no negative association either in emb or circulating
t cells. similarly, the positive correlation between the expression of foxp3 and a putative rejection marker vegf [26]
may be caused by the presence of activated rather than regulatory t cells within the graft. on the other hand, it is possible
that, by analogy to the situation encountered in cancer, vegf
and il-10 create an immunosuppressive environment within the
graft, inhibiting t cell reactivity [38].
similarly, the finding of foxp3 and ctla-4 expression in
peripheral blood cd4 and cd8 t cells even during emb grade 3
rejection episodes, may also indicate ongoing t cell activation
rather than presence of treg. however, the significant rise in the
level of expression of these markers after successful treatment
of a rejection episode, together with the negative association
between high level of foxp3 and development of alloantibodies
indicates that foxp3+ cd4 and cd8 t cell subsets have a
protective role against rejection in humans, similar to animal
models [9,22,23,39,40]. therefore, our data is consistent with a
recently proposed model [36,37], which suggests that in

20

g. vlad et al. / transplant immunology 18 (2007) 13–21

humans, transient expression of foxp3 is characteristic of all
activated t cells. however, stable expression of foxp3 differentiates t regulatory cells from activated t cells committed to
other effector functions [28,41]. the clinical consequences of
this observation cannot be underestimated as they warn against
the use of these markers for identifying t suppressors for either
diagnostic or prognostic purposes.
although it is difficult to discriminate between the possibility
that the cells expressing cd25, foxp3 and ctla-4 are precursors of th or treg, the quantitative changes which we observed
during resolving rejection argue in favor of continuous monitoring
of these markers to predict the outcome of a rejection episode.
this view is further supported by the finding that declining levels
of foxp3 occurring following treatment of rejection are
indicative of recurrence rather than remission of acute rejection.
the fact that cd25 is expressed by all t cells upon activation
explains the apparent inconsistency between the clinical
efficacy of  xxxd1798xxx  as an immunosuppressive agent and
its potential to block or deplete cd25+ t reg. our data contribute evidence that  xxxd1798xxx , particularly after repeated
administration, inhibits the production of alloantibodies and
improves patient survival, consistent with other authors finding
that it reduces the rate of acute rejection. [1–4,42] furthermore,
the data indicate that cd4+and cd8+ t regulatory cells develop
in patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx  together with standard
calcineurin — inhibitory therapy arguing against the view that
this type of immunosuppression prevents the differentiation of
regulatory t cells.
