abstract
this review describes current knowledge of the main
causes of vitamin b12 and folate deficiency. the most
common explanations for poor vitamin b12 status are a
low dietary intake of the vitamin (i.e., a low intake of
animal-source foods) and malabsorption. although it has
long been known that strict vegetarians (vegans) are at
risk for vitamin b12 deficiency, evidence now indicates
that low intakes of animal-source foods, such as occur in
some lacto-ovo vegetarians and many less-industrialized
countries, cause vitamin b12 depletion. malabsorption of
the vitamin is most commonly observed as food-bound
cobalamin malabsorption due to gastric atrophy in the
elderly, and probably as a result of helicobacter pylori
infection. there is growing evidence that gene polymorphisms in transcobalamins affect plasma vitamin b12
concentrations. the primary cause of folate deficiency is
low intake of sources rich in the vitamin, such as legumes
and green leafy vegetables, and the consumption of these
foods may explain why folate status can be adequate in
relatively poor populations. other situations in which
the risk of folate deficiency increases include lactation
and alcoholism.

deficiency are inadequate dietary intake of the vitamin,
and, primarily in the elderly, malabsorption due to
gastric atrophy. vitamin b12 absorption is a complex
process, involving a series of steps that can be affected
adversely by intestinal disease, infections, and medications (table 1). cobalamin mixes with  xxxg2255xxx —a
cobalamin-binding protein produced by salivary and
esophageal glands—during chewing and swallowing of
food. after its release from proteins in food by gastric
acid and pepsin, it is bound to  xxxg2255xxx  in the acid
ph of the stomach, then released from  xxxg2255xxx  by
proteolytic enzymes in the alkaline ph of the small
intestine, and bound to intrinsic factor secreted by the
stomach. subsequently, the vitamin is absorbed as a
cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex by binding to specific receptors in the ileal mucosa. the complex is taken
into lysosomes, where the cobalamin-intrinsic factor
complex is released and intrinsic factor is degraded.
the cobalamin is metabolized to its methyl and deoxyadenosyl forms, and released into plasma mainly in the
methyl form. in plasma, cobalamin is transported and
transferred to body cells bound to transcobalamin,
which carries about 25% of the cobalamin in plasma.
the remainder is bound to  xxxg2255xxx , the function
of which is not well understood.
when the recommended dietary allowance (rda)
for vitamin b12 was revised by the united states and
canada in 2002, it was based on the amount needed to

maintain normal serum vitamin b12 concentrations,
and to sustain normal hematopoiesis. for adults, the
rda is 2.4 to 2.8 µg/day depending on gender and
physiological status; for children aged 1 to 18 years,
the rda is from 0.9 to 2.4 µg/day. the median intake
of the vitamin from food (not including supplements)
in the united states is about 5 µg/day for men and 3.5
µg/day for women [1], but is considerably less where
animal-source food intake is low. who and fao, in
determining their recommended nutrient intakes
(rni) for vitamin b12, accepted the approach and
values developed by the institute of medicine, with
minor differences such as setting an ear and rni for
infants [2].
bioavailability (efficiency of absorption) of the
vitamin is assumed to be about 50% from the usual
diet, but lower from sources containing high amounts
(e.g., only 11% is absorbed from liver) [1]. synthetic
(crystalline) vitamin b12 is more efficiently absorbed:
approximately 60% from a low dose. in healthy adults,
about 50% of a 1-µg dose of vitamin b12 is absorbed
from food, but only 20% of a 5-µg dose, and 5% of
a 25-µg dose [3]. although the intestinal receptors
become saturated at high cobalamin intakes, about
1% of free vitamin b12 can be absorbed passively from
a high dose when given alone, or 0.5% when the dose
is given with food [4], a process that enables deficient
individuals to be repleted by taking large oral doses of
the crystalline form (i.e., 500 µg/day).
one aspect of vitamin b12 metabolism that is often
misunderstood is the time that it takes to deplete body
stores. this rate of depletion depends on the initial
amount stored, and the efficiency of absorption from
the diet and reabsorption from bile. hence, it is possible
to estimate the length of time it will take for the stores
to be depleted under various scenarios [1]. normal
body stores are about 1 to 3 mg; the turnover of the
vitamin in healthy persons is about 0.1% per day; and
signs of deficiency appear when the pool drops below
300 µg. if there is no intake from food or supplements,
and absorption is normal, a 1-mg store would meet
the body’s needs for 3 years, 2 mg for 5 years, and 3

mg for 6 years. in people with less efficient absorption
of the vitamin from food because of gastric atrophy,
these estimates would be reduced to 2, 3.6, and 4 years,
respectively. only if some of the vitamin is consumed
daily, absorption is normal, and initial stores are reasonable, does it become possible to avoid symptoms for
the ~25-year period that is often quoted as the time it
takes for deficiency symptoms to appear.
inadequate dietary intake
food sources of vitamin b12

vitamin b12 is found only in animal-source foods, so
intake is entirely dependent on the amount of animalsource foods in the diet, except where foods are fortified with the vitamin. table 2 provides information on
the amount of vitamin b12 in some common animalsource foods. other sources are fortified foods, and
supplements. although it has been suggested that foods
such as spirulina, nori, kelp, chlorella, and algae provide
useful amounts of the vitamin for vegans, it is likely that
the cobalamins in these foods are not biologically active
[5, 6]. in fact, they contain cobalamin analogs which
may inhibit cobalamin-dependent enzymes [7] and
cause further deterioration of vitamin b12 status [5].
more research is needed on whether foods prepared
with bacterial fermentation can provide useful amounts
of biologically active vitamin b12, but to date there is
little or no evidence that they can sustain adequate
vitamin b12 status. to be biologically active, all parts of
the cobalamin molecule must be present. the bacteria
in the human large intestine probably produce some
biologically active vitamin b12, but since the bacteria
are located below the ileum, the vitamin will not be
absorbed from this source.
strict vegetarians (vegans)

it is well known that strict vegetarians (vegans) are at
high risk for vitamin b12 deficiency, and multiple case
reports describe the clinical and biochemical symptoms
of vitamin b12 deficiency in this group. most of these
cases are infants who were born to, and breastfed by,
vegan mothers [8]. there are a few studies of larger
groups of vegans. for example, of 110 adults and 42
children from a macrobiotic community in the united
states, 51% of adults had low plasma cobalamin and
30% of adults and 55% of the children had elevated
urinary methylmalonic acid (mma) [9]. in healthy
vegan adults in california (n = 25, age 20 to 60 years),
40% had evidence of vitamin b12 depletion based on
either low plasma cobalamin (< 200 pg/ml), macrocytosis, or elevated serum mma [10]. in a group of
131 german vegans aged 20 to 82 years who did not
take vitamin b12 supplements, 40% of strict vegans had
plasma cobalamin < 150 µg/ml, and approximately the
same proportion had elevated plasma homocysteine

s22

[11]. in a longer-term study of dutch adherents to
macrobiotic diets, low plasma cobalamin was prevalent
in their infants and young children, accompanied by
megaloblastic anemia, elevated urinary mma, and
low breastmilk concentrations of the vitamin [12]. in
adolescence, those who had been fed macrobiotic diets
during early childhood had a greater risk of vitamin
b12 depletion, even though they had subsequently consumed omnivorous diets [13]. however, to what extent
this was due to persistently lower intakes of the vitamin
during the intervening years is uncertain.
because about half of the vitamin excreted in bile
is reabsorbed through enterohepatic circulation, it
used to be believed that it took about 20 to 30 years
for stores of the vitamin to become depleted in vegans
[14]. however, as discussed above, individuals starting
with normal stores and then changing to a vegan diet
would develop signs of deficiency in only 6 years. this
is consistent with observations in several studies. for
example, in the german vegan study discussed above
[11], vegan diets had been consumed for 7.1 years on
average, and those who had been vegans for > 5 years
had 1.8 times the rate of deficiency compared with
those who had followed this diet for < 5 years. in the
california study, the mean duration of veganism was
4.2 years, although on average the group had been
following some type of vegetarian diet for a total of 12
years [10]. few were taking supplements.
lacto-ovo vegetarians

more recently, evidence has accumulated to reveal that
lacto-ovo vegetarians are at greater risk of cobalamin
depletion than omnivores. this important observation,
which runs contrary to the traditional belief that only
vegans are at risk for deficiency, suggests that people
who avoid meat, or who consume relatively small
amounts of animal-source foods, are at risk for vitamin b12 deficiency. meat contains substantially more
vitamin b12 (2.3 µg/100 kcal raw meat, and 1.3 µg/100
kcal cooked meat) than milk (0.6 µg/100 kcal). for
example, in the netherlands, 40% of pregnant lacto-ovo
vegetarians failed to consume their estimated average
requirement (ear) for vitamin b12, compared with
6% of those who consumed small amounts of meat,
and none of those who consumed a typical western
diet [15].
several studies have shown low serum or plasma
vitamin b12 concentrations in lacto-ovo vegetarians.
the mean concentration in elderly dutch lacto-ovo
vegetarians was 273 pg/ml, significantly lower than in
omnivores (350 pg/ml) [16]. in new zealand, adults
who never ate red meat, yet ate chicken or fish once a
week or less, consumed only 1.6 µg/day of the vitamin
(median intake) and 50% had a serum vitamin b12
concentration < 200 pg/ml [17]. low intake of vitamin
b12 due to avoiding meat, although dairy products
were consumed, explained why one-third of a group of

l. h. allen

lacto-ovo vegetarians in england had low serum vitamin b12 concentrations [18]. young “new vegetarians”
recruited from a meditation center in sydney, australia,
consumed dairy products and had avoided meat for
only 7 years on average. however, 16% had vitamin
b12 deficiency (plasma vitamin b12 < 200 pg/ml) and
many more (number not stated) had “marginal” plasma
concentrations [19]. serum mma concentrations were
elevated in 0% of 79 middle-aged german omnivores,
5% of low consumers of meat (n not stated), 32% of
lacto-ovo vegetarians (n = 66), and 43% of vegans
(n = 28) [20].
we have analyzed the association between reported
intake of animal-source foods and the prevalence of
marginal (200–300 pg/ml) and deficient (< 200 pg/ml)
plasma vitamin b12 concentrations in the us national
health and nutrition evaluation survey (nhanes iii)
(allen et al., not published). the data set has plasma
cobalamin values for 12,020 individuals aged ≥ 4 years.
of those aged 19 to 50 years, 16% had deficient or marginal plasma vitamin b12, compared with 43% of those
who reported consuming meat or fish less than four
times a month. this prevalence of deficiency is similar
to that in the german lacto-ovo vegetarians described
by herrmann et al. [21]. the association between the
frequency of meat consumption, but not dairy product
or egg intake, and plasma vitamin b12 concentrations
was highly significant (p < .001) in nhanes iii.
how much animal-source food needs to be consumed to ensure adequate vitamin b12 status (assuming
that absorption is normal)? unfortunately there are few
data on the association between dietary vitamin b12
intake, and even fewer on intakes of specific foods, and
plasma vitamin b12. the institute of medicine review
of studies of individuals with low intake concluded
that at least 1.5 µg/day must be consumed to prevent
deficiency symptoms [1]. among pregnant low meateaters in the netherlands, those consuming 0.3 µg/day
from meat + fish + eggs had significantly lower plasma
vitamin b12 than those consuming 1.3 µg/day, who in
turn had lower concentrations than those consuming 3.2 µg/day from these sources. intakes from milk,
yogurt, and cheese were similar [15].
malabsorption

malabsorption tends to cause vitamin b12 depletion
more rapidly than does low dietary intake of the vitamin, and malabsorption combined with low intake
causes the most rapid depletion. deficiency symptoms
appear within 2 to 5 years when malabsorption is due
to lack of intrinsic factor or to intestinal abnormalities,
because absorption of the enterohepatically recirculated
vitamin is also impaired. however, when malabsorption is caused by poor release of the vitamin from food,
as in gastric atrophy, the efficiency of enterohepatic
recirculation may be normal, but the quantity reab-

causes of vitamin b12 and folate deficiency

sorbed is low once liver stores become depleted.
malabsorption of vitamin b12 is usually measured by
the schilling test, which basically requires the patient
to consume 1 µg of radioactively labeled synthetic
cyanocobalamin in the fasted state, and to collect his or
her urine for the subsequent 24 hours. a patient with
malabsorption will excrete lower amounts of radioactivity in the urine. in most cases, the labeled vitamin is
given in an aqueous solution, which will enable detection of malabsorption due to lack of intrinsic factor or
intestinal problems, but will not test ability to absorb
the vitamin from food. thus, a better way to administer
the test dose is to mix it with food, most commonly
egg yolk, in an eycat (egg yolk cobalamin absorption test) or “food-bound” schilling test [22]. the
food-bound test detects a much higher proportion of
malabsorption, especially in groups such as the elderly,
in whom gastric atrophy reduces gastric acid secretion
and the ability to release the vitamin from food [23].
unfortunately, few clinics in the world administer the
food-bound test, and the common failure to detect
existing malabsorption in other centers explains in
part why even the crystalline schilling test is rarely
prescribed.
malabsorption due to gastric atrophy

atrophic gastritis is a common condition in the elderly. it is diagnosed by elevated serum gastrin and/
or low serum pepsinogen i concentrations, or a low
pepsinogen i:pepsinogen ii ratio. based on elevated
serum gastrin, we observed a 30% prevalence of gastric
atrophy in a representative group of 1,546 californian
latinos aged ≥ 60 years [24]. similarly, in boston, usa,
31% of elderly (n = 359, age 60 to 99 years) had a low
pepsinogen i:pepsinogen ii ratio [25].
in atrophic gastritis, the stomach atrophy is accompanied by low or absent gastric acid secretion, and
sometimes by bacterial overgrowth in the upper small
intestine. type a atrophic gastritis is relatively uncommon, mainly affects the body of the stomach, and is
associated with pernicious anemia. intrinsic factor
secretion is low or absent so that both food-bound
and supplemental vitamin b12 are poorly absorbed.
type b atrophic gastritis, where mainly the antrum is
affected, is the most common type in the united states
[25]. since intrinsic factor secretion is usually relatively
normal in type b, except in severely affected, longterm cases, only the food-bound form of the vitamin
is poorly absorbed.
it is well documented that the elderly suffer from
a high prevalence of vitamin b12 deficiency, even in
industrialized countries. for example, in 548 surviving members of the original framingham study in the
united states, 40% had a serum cobalamin concentration < 350 pg/ml compared with 18% of younger
controls [26]. atrophic gastritis is one cause of the high
prevalence of deficiency in elderly. in the 1,546 califor-

nian latinos aged ≥ 60 years, 16% had plasma vitamin
b12 values in the marginal range (200–300 pg/ml), and
6% had deficiency (< 200 pg/ml) [24]. when elderly
with deficient plasma vitamin b12 concentrations (n =
57) were compared with those with marginal (n = 68)
and normal (n = 52) values, serum gastrin was inversely
related to plasma vitamin b12 and significantly higher
in the deficient group [24].
in the california latinos with elevated serum gastrin
(gastric atrophy), plasma vitamin b12 was significantly
correlated with vitamin b12 intake from supplements +
fortified food, but not from unfortified food, because
synthetic (crystalline) vitamin b12 can be absorbed by
individuals with gastric atrophy. although the lack
of gastric acid in this condition impairs the release
of vitamin b12 from proteins in food, the intrinsic
factor secretion is usually adequate until the gastric
atrophy is very severe. this explains why the elderly
can usually absorb vitamin b12 from fortified foods or
supplements. for this reason the us-canada rda for
vitamin b12 is not set higher for the elderly, who cannot
absorb enough from food even if more is consumed,
but rather it is recommended that the majority of their
vitamin b12 should be obtained from fortified foods or
supplements. moreover, since about 1% of the vitamin
is absorbed by passive transport, even in conditions
where intrinsic factor is lacking, vitamin b12 repletion
can be achieved by high dose oral supplementation
(e.g., 500 µg/day).
malabsorption due to pernicious anemia

pernicious anemia is the final stage of an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies against h+k+adenosine triphosphatase destroy parietal cells in the
stomach. it was first described in the early 1800s, and
diagnosed on the basis of neurological and gastric
problems and anemia. in the late 1800s, it was observed
that the condition was associated with atrophy of the
gastric mucosa. in 1948, vitamin b12 was identified
as the “anti-pernicious anemia principle.” pernicious
anemia results from lack of gastric acid and intrinsic
factor, and its prevalence is lower than commonly
assumed. it can be detected by measuring anti-intrinsic
factor antibodies in serum. prevalence in californian
women was 4.3% in blacks and 4% in whites (n = 729,
age ≥ 60 years) [27]. the prevalence may be higher in
blacks than in whites [28].
causes of vitamin b12 deficiency in developing
countries

typically the diets of populations in low-income countries, and especially those of the most disadvantaged
groups, are low in animal-source foods because of
their relatively high cost, lack of availability, and/or
cultural and religious beliefs. it has become apparent
that many such populations have a high prevalence of

s24

l. h. allen

deficient and marginal plasma vitamin b12 concentrations. table 3 provides a summary of some reported
prevalences of low and marginal cobalamin values
in latin america. a similar situation is emerging in
other poor regions of the world; in urban india 60%
of plasma vitamin b12 values were < 150 pg/ml [29],
and in nepal, 49% of pregnant women had serum
vitamin b12 < 225 pg/ml and 61% had elevated mma
[30]. in rural kenya we found 31% deficient + 24%
marginal plasma vitamin b12 concentrations in rural
schoolchildren [31]. the new who prevalence data
are provided in the report by mclean et al. [32] in this
supplement.
there is some evidence that an inadequate intake
of vitamin b12, rather than malabsorption, is the main
cause of this high prevalence of deficiency, although
the latter cannot be ruled out because it has not been
assessed. in 94 lactating women in guatemala city,
usual vitamin b12 intake was correlated with, and the
main predictor of, maternal plasma cobalamin concentrations (r = − 0.20, p < .05) [33]. replacement of
breastmilk with cow’s milk, which is much higher in
vitamin b12, predicted higher plasma cobalamin concentrations in a group of predominantly vitamin b12deficient guatemalan infants [34]. vitamin b12 intake
was the only significant predictor of plasma vitamin
b12 in 180 guatemalan schoolchildren—60 each in
deficient, marginal, and normal plasma vitamin b12

groups [35]. helicobacter pylori infection and bacterial overgrowth were not significant predictors. the
most definitive study to date was conducted in kenyan
schoolchildren enrolled in a school feeding intervention [31, 36]. at baseline, 69% of the 503 children had
low or marginal plasma vitamin b12 concentrations.
those in the lowest tertile of animal-source food
intake (0% to 1.3% of daily energy intake) had a six
times greater risk of low serum cobalamin compared
with those in the highest tertile of animal-source food
intake (4% to 37% of daily kcal). the children were
randomly assigned (by schools) to receive isocaloric
daily snacks of maize and beans alone, maize and beans
plus meat (60 g minced beef, an additional 1.3 µg/day
of vitamin b12), or milk (200 ml, an additional 1 µg/
day of vitamin b12), or to no intervention, for 2 years.
at the end of 1 year of supplementation, the reduction
in prevalence of deficient + marginal plasma vitamin
b12 values was significantly greater in the meat- and
milk-supplemented groups. at the end of 2 years, the
prevalence of deficient + marginal concentrations fell
from 56% to 4% in the meat-supplemented group, and
from 41% to 9% in the milk-supplemented group. this
study shows that the high prevalence of vitamin b12
deficiency in these kenyan schoolchildren at baseline
was predicted by their low intake of animal-source
foods, and that a daily food supplement providing
about the daily recommended intake (on about 50% of

causes of vitamin b12 and folate deficiency

the days in each year) could be absorbed, and restored
adequate vitamin b12 status.
vitamin b12 deficiency in infants and young children

the liver of well-nourished newborn infants contains
only 25 to 30 µg of vitamin b12, and even less when the
mother is vitamin b12 depleted during pregnancy [37].
at birth, concentrations of vitamin b12 in cord blood
(n = 173) were strongly correlated with maternal levels
in a norwegian sample [38]. higher maternal parity
predicted lower infant plasma vitamin b12 at age 6
months. even in well-nourished norwegian infants,
plasma cobalamin is low during the first 6 months
of life; total plasma homocysteine and cobalamin are
strongly correlated, but homocysteine and folate are
not; and serum mma tends to be elevated. the norwegian investigators concluded that a substantial number
of infants have insufficient vitamin b12 to support
homocysteine remethylation in this well-nourished
population [39].
infants born to vitamin b12-deficient mothers are at
very high risk of developing deficiency because of their
low stores of the vitamin at birth [37] and the fact that
concentrations of the vitamin in their mothers’ breastmilk will be inadequate [33, 40, 41]. maternal plasma
and breastmilk vitamin b12 concentrations are quite
strongly correlated in most studies.
there are two larger-scale studies of the vitamin
b12 status of vegetarian women and their children. in
boston, usa, participants included 64 women and
42 children (median age 3.9 years) [9]. low serum
cobalamin (< 220 pg/ml) was present in half of the
women who had been strict vegetarians for 1 year, and
in all after 5 years. over half the children had high
urinary mma, one-third were stunted, and elevated
mma was associated with stunting. vitamin b12 in the
breastmilk averaged 0.3 µg/l in vegetarians (n = 17)
and 0.5 µg/l in omnivores (n = 6) [42]. women who
had eliminated animal-source foods from their diet
for only 4 to 5 years clearly secreted less vitamin b12
in their breastmilk. maternal serum and breastmilk
vitamin b12 concentrations were strongly correlated
(r = 0.79, p < .0001), and inversely correlated with
maternal urinary mma (r = –0.830, p < .0001). infant
urinary mma increased when milk vitamin b12 fell
below 0.5 µg/l. these are the only data available on
which to base a cutoff for adequate breastmilk vitamin
b12 concentration. the boston studies show that the
onset of vitamin b12 deficiency is more rapid after
animal-source foods are eliminated than is usually
believed, and that breastfed infants are very vulnerable
to poor maternal vitamin b12 status. this is likely to be
the situation in many areas of the world where animalsource food intake is low.
in mexico we observed that 62% of women at 6 to
8 months postpartum had low vitamin b12 concentra-

tions in breastmilk, and milk and infant plasma levels
were significantly correlated [40]. in guatemala city,
31% of women had low vitamin b12 in breastmilk at 3
months postpartum [33]. in another study in guatemala city, 24% of 127 infants aged 7 to 12 months had
deficient (< 200 pg/ml), and 37% had marginal (200 to
300 pg/ml), plasma vitamin b12 concentrations. surprisingly, plasma vitamin b12 was lower in those infants
who consumed more breastmilk (r = − 0.33, p < .0001
with measured breastmilk intake, kcal/day) [34]. in a
different group of infants (n = 304) aged 12 months in
guatemala city, deficient and marginal plasma vitamin
b12 values were found in 30% and 20% of infants, and
36% and 32% of their mothers, respectively [43]. the
main predictors of plasma cobalamin concentrations
were higher maternal plasma vitamin b12, higher intake
of the vitamin from complementary foods (notably
cow’s milk), lower frequency of breastfeeding, and
larger household size. the better vitamin b12 status of
infants consuming more cow’s milk may be due to the
fact cow’s milk vitamin b12 content is 10 times higher
than that in breastmilk in well-nourished women, and
probably closer to 20 times higher than in breastmilk of
the vitamin b12-depleted women in guatemala city.
infections
helicobacter pylori infection

helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative, spiral bacterium
with four to six flagellae that causes acute and chronic
gastritis, and over time, gastric atrophy. it is probably
the main cause of gastric ulcers, and of gastric atrophy
in the elderly. the bacteria reside at the interface of the
gastric epithelial cells and the gastric mucosa. h. pylori
uniquely produces urease, so it can be diagnosed by
giving the patient a dose of isotopically labeled urea
which the bacteria will hydrolyze to ammonia and
water; and measuring the presence of labeled ammonia in exhaled breath. diagnosis is also possible from
detection of h. pylori antibodies in serum.
h. pylori infection is very widespread, and once gastric colonization has occurred, it persists throughout
life unless treated. in developing countries and areas
of poor sanitation, almost all infants and children may
be infected by the first years of life [44]. in western
countries, the prevalence is closer to 20% in persons
aged < 40 years, and 50% in those aged > 60 years. the
standard treatment (antibiotics, bismuth, and acid
suppressors) for 1 to 2 weeks is usually effective, but is
often not provided unless there are clinical symptoms.
in many people the infection is asymptomatic while
others may develop acute gastritis.
infection with h. pylori causes a series of changes in
gastric function prior to the final stage of gastric atrophy. the initial infection causes transient hypochlorhydria and usually few or no clinical symptoms [45].
in some persons, the infection causes gastric  xxxd2315xxx -

s26

mation with elevated serum gastrin and pepsinogen
and reduced somatostatin concentrations [46]. the
elevated gastrin and reduced somatostatin then cause
elevated acid secretion from gastric parietal cells [45],
but over time (usually many years) some but not all
infected persons develop peptic ulcer disease, gastric
cancer, and eventually atrophic gastritis with low gastric acid secretion, and possibly inadequate production
of intrinsic factor.
since h. pylori infection eventually causes achlorhydria and gastric atrophy, it may be the major cause
of food-bound vitamin b12 malabsorption and gastric
atrophy in the elderly. however, proof of causality has
been somewhat inconsistent; it is not usually known
how long the infection has been present or the density
of bacteria, and the different genotypes of the bacteria have different effects. of vitamin b12-deficient
patients from california diagnosed with food-bound
vitamin b12 malabsorption, 78% had serum antibodies against h. pylori compared with 42% of those with
normal vitamin b12 absorption [47]. in another study
in california, h. pylori infection was associated with
food-bound cobalamin malabsorption, and 78% of
subjects with severe malabsorption were infected [48].
h. pylori infection, gastrin levels, ethnic origin, and age
were independent risk factors for food-bound vitamin
b12 malabsorption. in 174 guatemalan schoolchildren
aged 8 to 12 years, 83% were infected so its prevalence
was not different among those with deficient, marginal,
and normal plasma vitamin b12 concentrations [35].
on average the infected children had elevated serum
gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations, suggesting that
they had gastric inflammation but not gastric atrophy
at this life stage. however, elevated serum gastrin was
associated with elevated serum mma, perhaps indicating an early stage of vitamin b12 depletion. few studies
have measured the effect of h. pylori treatment on
vitamin b12 status or absorption. an intervention trial
in turkey reported that h. pylori was present in 56% of
138 patients with vitamin b12 deficiency, but eradication of the bacteria improved anemia and serum vitamin b12 in 40% of the infected patients [49]. overall, it
is probable that h. pylori is a risk factor for vitamin b12
malabsorption, at least in adults and elderly who may
have had long-term exposure to the bacteria. however,
a review of 25 studies on this question concluded that
the results are still inconclusive due to methodological
differences among studies, and that h. pylori does not
play a major role in the development of cobalamin
deficiency [50].
giardia lamblia infection

giardia lamblia is a parasite that infects about 20% of
the world’s population, especially in areas of developing
countries where sanitation is poor. the parasite cysts
are ingested in contaminated food or water, and about
three times more children are infected than adults. the

l. h. allen

parasite causes nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps,
and weight loss, although there is substantial variation
in the intensity of symptoms. in 29 danish children
with diarrhea caused by giardia, one-third had poor
absorption of vitamin b12 but this did not cause low
plasma vitamin b12, perhaps due to the short period
of infection [51]. twelve percent of giardia-infected
patients had vitamin b12 malabsorption in another
study [52], but none in another [53]. thus it is uncertain to what extent giardia infection causes vitamin b12
deficiency, but any malabsorption would be expected to
occur in longer-term and more severe infection.
fish tapeworm infection

the fish tapeworm, diphyllobothrium latum, occurs
in northern europe, latin america, japan, and many
other countries [54]. infection with the parasite can
occur due to eating raw or undercooked fish, such as
salmon, from cold-water lakes and rivers. it used to be
common around the great lakes in the united states,
causing diphyllobothriasis in jewish and scandinavian
fish consumers, although it is now rare in these locations. the fact that it causes vitamin b12 deficiency was
first recognized in 1886 when it was identified as the
cause of “fish tapeworm anemia” [55], which mimics
pernicious anemia. the tapeworm competes for vitamin b12 with its human host, taking up large amounts
of the vitamin from the intestinal lumen [56].
bacterial overgrowth

bacterial overgrowth refers to the presence of substantial numbers of bacteria in the upper intestine,
which is normally relatively sterile. this condition
occurs primarily as a result of low intestinal motility,
with hypochlorhydria having less clinical importance
[57]. low gastrointestinal motility can result from gastrointestinal surgery, including gastric bypass, jejunal
diverticulosis, and blind-loop syndrome after intestinal
surgery, or structural abnormalities, including diverticulosis in the duodenum or jejunum.
bacterial overgrowth impairs absorption of vitamin
b12 from food. the mechanism may be competition
with intestinal bacteria for the uptake of vitamin b12
[58], bacterial conversion of the vitamin to inactive
analogs, and in hypochlorhydria, reduced absorption
of the vitamin from food. in subjects with bacterial
overgrowth due to hypochlorhydria, poor absorption
of food-bound vitamin b12 was rapidly normalized by
antibiotic (tetracycline) treatment [58].
malaria

plasma vitamin b12 concentrations were not different
in kenyan or senegalese schoolchildren with malaria
diagnosed based on serum antigens [31, 60].
hiv and aids

plasma cobalamin concentrations are often low in

s27

causes of vitamin b12 and folate deficiency

patients infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv), and fall further with progression of the
disease [61, 62]. malabsorption of the vitamin is more
likely among persons with gastrointestinal symptoms
[63], and whose hiv infection is more advanced [64].
of 310 hiv+ patients in the baltimore-washington
dc area, followed for 9 years on average, those with
low serum vitamin b12 (< 160 pg/ml) at baseline were
free of aids for 4 years, compared with 8 years for
those with normal values [65]. these differences persisted after removing from analysis those with more
advanced disease at baseline and other relevant parameters. these investigators and others [62] concluded
that low serum vitamin b12 concentrations preceded
progression of hiv+ to aids, and predict more rapid
progression. there is no evidence that vitamin b12 supplementation will slow progression of the disease.

sorption and lower serum vitamin b12 concentrations
in these patients [70].
pancreatic insufficiency may also impair vitamin b12
absorption from food. the pancreas secretes trypsin
and bicarbonate, which are required for release of
vitamin b12 from r-binder in the intestine. impaired
trypsin secretion occurs in chronic pancreatitis in
which vitamin b12 absorption is impaired in 40% of
cases, and in cystic fibrosis in which absorption is
almost always impaired [71, 72]. in spite of the clearly
impaired absorption of the vitamin from food, it is
uncommon to find vitamin b12 deficiency in patients
with pancreatitis [73]. administration of trypsin with
vitamin b12, or bicarbonate to increase ileal ph, can
improve vitamin b12 absorption and status in these
conditions.
medications

other medical problems

because vitamin b12 is absorbed in the ileum, its
absorption is impaired in several diseases and conditions in which ileal function is abnormal. malabsorption occurs after surgery where > 60 cm of the ileum
is removed [66], and in both tropical and nontropical
sprue. tropical sprue, as its name suggests, occurs
mostly in the tropics and subtropics. symptoms include
diarrhea, malabsorption, vitamin b12 and folate deficiency, and anemia.  xxxd2716xxx  12 malabsorption is
probably caused by the ileal mucosa lesions. studies
in india [67] reported that between two-thirds and all
of the patients with this condition have vitamin b12
deficiency. the resulting anemia responds to vitamin
b12 and antibiotics. the prevalence of this condition
has diminished so that it has “virtually disappeared
from reports” [68].
nontropical sprue, more commonly known as celiac
disease or gluten enteropathy, is most common in
caucasians of european ancestry, and in 70% of cases
affects women. it is caused by an allergic reaction to
gluten in wheat, rye, oats, barley, and triticale. inflammation of the small intestine causes flattening of the
villi and loss of absorptive capacity. a gluten-free diet
(which patients must consume for the rest of their
lives) allows mucosal repair and improves vitamin b12
absorption compared with a diet containing gluten
[69]. this condition might only occur if there are ileal
lesions.
zollinger-ellison syndrome affects 6 out of 100,000
young adults, and is caused by a gastrinoma in the duodenum or pancreas that results in excessive amounts
of gastric acid secretion secondary to high gastrin
production. vitamin b12 malabsorption occurs in these
patients due to the low ileal ph, and can be relieved in
the short-term by acid-suppressing drugs. however,
long-term administration of these drugs, especially
omeprazole, can cause food-bound vitamin b12 malab-

the most commonly reported adverse effects of medications on vitamin b12 status are from drugs that impair
gastric acid and pepsin secretion, and subsequently
impair release of the vitamin from proteins in food.
frequently used medications of this type, for patients
with gastric ulcers or gastroesophageal reflux disease,
include h2-receptor antagonists such as cimetidine,
and  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors. cimetidine inhibits both
gastric acid and pepsin secretion [74, 75] and possibly
secretion of intrinsic factor [75, 76]. the effect of
cimetidine on vitamin b12 absorption is dose-related,
with intakes > 1,000 mg/day reducing food-bound
vitamin b12 absorption [74, 77], but not 400 mg/day
[77].  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors, such as omeprazole and
 xxxd2444xxx , strongly inhibit gastric acid secretion and
subsequently food-bound vitamin b12 absorption [78].
a 20 mg/day dose of omeprazole reduced vitamin b12
absorption from a protein-bound source by about 70%,
while 40 mg/day reduced absorption by about 90%
[78]. long-term omeprazole treatment of patients with
zollinger-ellison syndrome did lower plasma vitamin
b12 concentrations, especially in achlorhydric patients
[70]. however, there are few indications that taking
lower doses of acid-suppressing drugs often causes
vitamin b12 depletion, possibly due to their not being
taken for a long enough time.
gene polymorphisms

mild  xxxg2255xxx  deficiency has been associated with increased risk of low serum cobalamin
concentrations and may explain 15% of low values
[79]. a common polymorphism has been identified
in the vitamin b12 carrier protein, transcobalamin ii,
where proline (p) is substituted for arginine [80]. in
the relatively small groups of samples analyzed so far,
prevalence is about 20% 259-arginine, 25% 259-proline
arginine, and 50% heterozygotes [81-83]. binding to

s28

vitamin b12 and vitamin b12 receptor binding affinity
are similar between the tc-ii 259-proline and tc-ii
259-arginine phenotypes. mean total plasma vitamin
b12 and homocysteine concentrations did not differ
among those homozygous for the arginine or proline
form of tc-ii, but mean mma concentrations were
lower in the pp and pr groups compared with the
rr group. it is possible that the pp genotype delivers cobalamin to tissues more efficiently [81]. much
remains to be learned about how polymorphisms might
affect vitamin b12 status. none of six tc-ii polymorphisms was associated with increased risk of neural
tube defects (ntd) in a large sample of ntd mothers,
fathers, and their affected children [84].
juvenile pernicious anemia is an inherited disorder
manifested by lack of intrinsic factor, and accompanied by cobalamin malabsorption. malabsorption
also occurs in immerslund-gräsbeck syndrome, due
to abnormalities in the cubulin/ xxxg155xxx  complex.
defects in  xxxg2255xxx  binding proteins do not produce
abnormalities, although severe cobalamin deficiency
can result from defects in the transcobalamin binding
proteins.

causes of folate deficiency
overview of folate absorption and requirement

the generic term “folate” includes the many chemical
forms of the vitamin.  xxxd2146xxx  is the synthetic form
used as a food fortificant and vitamin supplement. it
consists of a p-aminobenzoic acid molecule joined
at one end to a pteridine ring and at the other to a
single  xxxd2431xxx  molecule. most naturally occurring folates in food (“food folates”) contain one to
six additional glutamate molecules linked through a
peptide bond to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamine.
to be absorbed, the food folate polyglutamates must
be hydrolyzed by  xxxg887xxx  in the brush border.
when  xxxd2146xxx  is given at high doses, absorption
becomes less efficient due to saturation of the intestinal folate transport systems, but smaller amounts of
the monoglutamate form are also absorbed by passive
diffusion. in general, the bioavailability of food folate
is about half that of the crystalline form.  xxxd2146xxx  is
also more stable than food folate.
folate stores in well-nourished adult men are ≈12
to 28 mg, and based on biopsies, the liver contains
about half of the total. a substantial amount of folate
is secreted in bile, with bile folate flux over five times
higher than usual daily intake [85]—most of which is
reabsorbed in the small intestine [86]. renal reabsorption is also efficient and most urinary folate consists
of cleavage products. some fecal folate loss occurs,
but some fecal folate derives from intestinal bacteria.
low intake or poor absorption of the vitamin is readily

l. h. allen

detected as low serum folate, followed by low erythrocyte folate, an increase in plasma homocysteine, and
eventually megaloblastic anemia. it has been estimated
that, based on tracer studies in humans, plasma and
erythrocyte folate pools would fall by 50% in 100 to
130 days after dietary folate is removed, then to 75%
of baseline in another 200 to 300 days, although other
body pools turn over more slowly [85].
the recommended intake of folate by adults is based
on that required to normalize erythrocyte folate, which
is similar to the intake needed to maintain serum folate
and suppress plasma homocysteine. the rda increases
from 150 to as much as 400 µg/day from age 1 year
to 18 years, and is 400 µg/day for adults. who/fao
adopted the institute of medicine recommendations
for folate [1].
inadequate folate intake

the main dietary sources of folate include green leafy
vegetables, legumes, some fruits, and fortified cereals
and cereal products (table 4). it is probable that these
data underestimate the true dietary folate content, as
past extraction or folate digestion procedures were not
optimal. a tri-enzyme approach is now recommended
for folate analysis in cereal grains, and gives substantially higher results than older methods [87, 88]. there
are few data on folate intakes in different locations, but
one would anticipate that status is poorer in populations who rely on unfortified wheat or rice as a staple,
and consume low amounts of legumes and green leafy
vegetables. this may explain why lower serum folate
concentrations occur in some industrialized countries,
such as sweden, and in the united states and chile
before fortification. in contrast, 1 cup of cooked beans
or 6 maize tortillas each provide about 70% of the rda
for folate for adult women, so the risk of deficiency may
be low in populations consuming substantial amounts
of maize and beans, such as in many countries in latin
america.
there has been a substantial amount of research on
the association between level of dietary folate intake
and folate status, mostly in the context of exploring
links between folate intake and risk of ntd, and the
need for  xxxd2146xxx  fortification. a review of existing
studies concluded that if usual dietary folate intake
is low (≤ 100 µg/day), adding 300 µg/day of  xxxd2146xxx 
from fortified foods or supplements is adequate to
maintain folate status even during pregnancy when
folate requirements are substantially higher [1]. mean
plasma homocysteine concentrations in adults stabilize when folate intakes are ~300 µg/day and are not
further lowered by intakes > 400 µg/day [89]. when
20 women consuming 281 mg from food were given
supplemental doses of 100, 150, 200, and 400 µg/day
of  xxxd2146xxx  incrementally over 32 weeks, serum folate
increased over the range of intake, but the maximum

a. fortified with  xxxd2146xxx  and converted to dietary folate equivalents.

reduction in plasma homocysteine occurred with the
200 µg/day supplement [90]. the institute of medicine
committee that set recommended folate intakes for
the united states and canada concluded that the risk
of ntd increased below a dietary folate equivalent
(dfe) intake of 400 µg/day, but no reduction was
apparent with higher intakes [1]. data are lacking at
higher intakes, however.
folate bioavailability

it is generally accepted that the bioavailability of folate
is ≈100% for  xxxd2146xxx  supplements taken on an empty
stomach; 85% for fortificant  xxxd2146xxx  consumed in
foods (based on absorption from fortified orange juice,
as absorption from whole meals has not been assessed)
[87]; and 50% from food [1, 91]. because 85% of folic
acid is absorbed when consumed with food, and 50%
of food folate is absorbed,  xxxd2146xxx  taken with food is

1.7 times more available than food folate. this means
that the content of folate in fortified food should be
calculated as: dietary folate equivalents = actual µg of
food folate + (1.7 × µg of  xxxd2146xxx ) [1]. the validity of
the 1.7 multiplier was supported by a recent long-term,
controlled folate feeding study in women, where food
folate bioavailability from a mixed diet was about 60%
that of added  xxxd2146xxx  [92].
there is little evidence that other nutrients or dietary
constituents affect folate bioavailability, including dietary fiber [93], although organic acids in orange juice
can reduce the activity of intestinal  xxxd2146xxx 
hydrolase, which has a ph optimum of 6 to 7, thus
impairing absorption of heptaglutamate [94]. although
a naturally occurring inhibitor of  xxxd2146xxx 
hydrolase exists in the skin of some pulses, bean
consumption did not reduce the bioavailability of
heptaglutamates in humans [95]. in general, the activity
of  xxxd2146xxx  hydrolase exceeds that needed to

s30

hydrolyze usual amounts of polyglutamyl folates consumed, and in most [96], although not all [97], studies
the bioavailability of monoglutamyl and polyglutamyl
folates is similar [96].

and increased urinary excretion [114]. in a micro-pig
model, the onset of alcoholic liver disease was much
more rapid when the animals were provided with
a folate-deficient diet than when folate intake was
adequate 115].

losses during food preparation

unlike  xxxd2146xxx , food folates are relatively unstable to
oxidation and heat, so large losses can occur during
food preparation and cooking. boiling destroys 50%
to 80% of the folate in green vegetables [98] and 50%
of that in legumes [99]. chopping and grinding spinach increases folate bioavailability [100], but ascorbic
acid in foods improves folate stability [101]. there is
inadequate information on the overall impact of these
food preparation practices on folate status.
increased requirements during lactation

breastmilk folate concentrations are relatively well
maintained even when maternal intake and status are
poor. thus lactation, especially if prolonged, may be a
cause of folate depletion of some women in developing countries [102, 103]. iron deficiency significantly
reduces milk folate secretion in rats, but it is not clear
whether this occurs in human subjects [104].
alcoholism

folate deficiency, as evidenced by low serum or erythrocyte folate and elevated homocysteine concentrations,
is common in chronic alcoholic patients. in the united
states prior to flour fortification with  xxxd2146xxx , and in
europe, folate deficiency occurred in the majority of
those consuming > 80 g ethanol per day [105–108].
alcoholics with liver disease have even poorer folate
status than those who do not [107, 109]. in one study,
78% had low serum folate [109], and in another, 33%
had a megaloblastic bone marrow [110].
multiple factors contribute to causing folate deficiency in chronic alcoholism. these include low
folate intake [107, 111], poor folate absorption due to
impaired transcription of the intestinal folate carrier
[112]; reduced liver uptake and storage [111, 113];

polymorphisms

several gene polymorphisms affect folate metabolism,
as discussed by finnell et al. elsewhere in this supplement [116]. some of these are associated with reduced
folate absorption and poorer status, while others are
not. a polymorphism (c1561t) in the gene encoding  xxxd2146xxx  hydrolase reduces activity of the
enzyme in vitro, but it is present in only about 0.5%
of the population. it has been associated with folate
status in some studies [117], but not others [118]. the
677c→t polymorphism in methyltetrahydrofolate
reductase affects ≅ 10% to 30% of various population
groups studied, mostly in industrialized countries, and
the homozygote is associated with increased plasma
homocysteine and a tendency to lower serum and
erythrocyte folate concentrations [119]. in a recent
study, only t/t (and not c/c) subjects had a significant inverse correlation between plasma homocysteine
and erythrocyte 5-methyl folate concentrations, but
the effect of dietary folate restriction on red blood
cell folates was not different between the genotypes
[120]. current knowledge on the associations between
gene polymorphisms and risk of ntd and other birth
defects is reviewed by finnell et al. elsewhere in this
supplement [116].
medications

medications known to impair folate status include
methotrexate (a folate antagonist used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, and dilantin),
 xxxd3255xxx  for treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis,
and pyrimethamine for treatment of malaria. very large
doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ≅
3,900 mg/day) can have antifolate activity, but routine
use is not known to impair folate status.
