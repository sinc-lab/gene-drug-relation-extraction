objective: to investigate matrix metalloproteinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx ) in heart failure caused by
ischaemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and the impact of angiotensin converting enzyme
(ace) inhibition on mmp.
design and main outcome measures: mmp were extracted from myocardium of patients with heart
failure (coronary artery disease, n = 13; idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (idcm), n = 16) and from
controls (n = 6). the active form of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  was measured by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay; activity of mmps by zymography; mrna expression of mmps by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
results: active  xxxg1440xxx  was significantly increased in coronary artery disease (mean (sd) 1.6
(0.35) ng/ml) and idcm (2.11 (0.54) ng/ml) in comparison with controls (0.53 (0.15) ng/ml).
increased  xxxg1428xxx  was only found in idcm (3.68 (0.41) ng/ml). there were corresponding increases
in mmp activity but no upregulation of mrna expression was found. the ace inhibitors captopril and
ramiprilate inhibited  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activity in vitro (inhibitory capacity (ic50), in mmol/l:  xxxg1428xxx :
captopril 2.0 (0.16), ramiprilate 2.1 (0.3);  xxxg1440xxx : captopril 1.65 (0.18), ramiprilate 2.0 (0.3)). lisinopril inhibited  xxxg1440xxx  significantly but did not inhibit  xxxg1428xxx  in vitro (ic50  xxxg1428xxx : 7.4 (0.88);  xxxg1440xxx :
7.86 (2.23)). inhibition of mmp activity by ace inhibitors was blunted by zinc excess.
conclusions: upregulation of  xxxg1440xxx  activity is common in the failing myocardium, independent of
the underlying disease. missing upregulation of transcription suggests that activation of latent forms of
mmp is the source of increased mmp activity, rather than increased de novo synthesis. some ace
inhibitors may influence mmp activity by a direct effect.

ecent results from the elite-2 (evaluation of losartan in
the elderly) study,1 which was designed to show the
superiority of losartan over captopril, failed even to give
an assurance that these two agents are of equivalent benefit in
heart failure treatment. this result has led to a re-examination
of the factors that determine the actions of angiotensin
converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and sartans in the failing
heart. ace inhibitors inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme,
which catalyses the formation of  xxxg99xxx  from
 xxxg99xxx ; sartans are thought to inhibit the ace system
more effectively by  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonism. on the
other hand, the haemodynamic consequences of ace inhibition and  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonism only partially
explain their beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling in heart
failure.2 local mechanisms have been suggested—for example, inhibition of the tissue ace system and a decrease in the
breakdown of bradykinin.3 sorbi and colleagues4 suggested
that reduced proteinuria in hypertensive patients treated with
captopril reflected a direct effect of captopril on matrix
metalloproteinase-2 ( xxxg1428xxx ) and  xxxg1440xxx  activity, mediated
by the sulfydryl group on the ace inhibitor.
comparing the effect of ace and mmp inhibition on
cardiac remodelling in a rapid pacing induced heart failure
model in pigs, mcelmurray and colleagues showed that both
mmp and ace inhibitors significantly reduced the degree of
left ventricular dilatation.5 however, mmp activity in the left
ventricular myocardium did not differ between animals
treated with mmp inhibitors, ace inhibitors, or combined
treatment. so the question arises as to whether ace inhibitors
have a direct influence on myocardial mmp activity.

in the light of increasing interest in the role of the cardiac
proteolytic system, our aim in this study was to investigate the
gelatinases  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in hearts that had failed
because of coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (idcm), and the influence of ace inhibitors
on these enzymes.

methods
subjects
human left ventricular heart tissue was obtained from
explanted hearts at the time of heart transplantation. samples
of myocardium from 16 hearts with idcm, 13 with ischaemic
cardiomyopathy, and six brain dead organ donor hearts
(which could not be used for heart transplantation) were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen after explantation and stored at
−80°c until analysis. idcm was diagnosed according to recent
world health organization criteria.6 the severity of heart failure did not differ between the idcm and coronary artery disease groups.
the protocol of the study was approved by the ethics commission at the university of jena.

preparation of mmp
approximately 25 mg of frozen adult left ventricle was
washed three or four times with cold saline. cardiac tissue was
then incubated in 1000 µl of extraction buffer (10 mmol/l
 xxxd402xxx  at ph 5, 0.15 mol/l nacl, 1 µmol/l  xxxd3556xxx ,
20 mmol cacl2, 1.5 mmol/l nan3, and 0.01% (vol/vol) triton x
100) at 4°c for 72 hours. the extraction buffer was collected
and the ph was raised by the addition of 1.5 mol/l tris hcl
buffer (ph 8.8). aliquots from these samples were loaded
directly onto substrate gels.
total protein in extracts
a bio-rad dye binding assay (palo alto, california, usa) was
used to estimate the total protein concentration in tissue
extracts according to bradford.7
visualisation of gelatinolytic activities on sds substrate
gels (zymography)
sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) substrate gels were prepared as
published elsewhere,8 with modification.9 gelatine (porcine
skin, 300 bloom from sigma, st louis, missouri, usa) was
added to standard laemmli acrylamide polymerisation
mixture at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. tissue extract was
mixed with substrate gel sample buffer (10% sds, 0.25 mol/l
tris hcl ph 6.8, and 0.1% wt/vol bromphenol blue) to a final
protein concentration of 1000 mg/ml, and 20 µl were loaded
under non-reducing conditions immediately without boiling
into wells of a 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide laemmli stacking gel on
a cast vertical gel. gels were run at 15 ma/gel while stacking,
and at 20 ma/gel during the separation phase at room
temperature. following electrophoresis the gels were soaked
in 2.5% (wt/vol) triton x 100 with gentle shaking for 30 minutes at room temperature with one change of detergent solution. the gels were rinsed and incubated overnight at 37°c in
substrate buffer (50 mmol/l tris hcl ph 8, 5 mmol/l cacl2, and
0.02% wt/vol nan3).
after incubation, the gels were stained for three minutes in
coomassie blue r250 in acetic acid: xxxd2400xxx :water
(1:3:6 by volume), and destained in water overnight with or
without ace inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril: sigma; ramiprilate: aventis, bad soden, germany). gels were scanned and
analysed by densitometry for lysis band intensity (herolab
imaging system, wiesloch, germany). the mmp gelatinolytic
activity results are expressed in arbitrary units expressing the
videodensitometrically determined ratio of the mmp to the
activity of mmp purified standard proteins (invitek, berlin,
germany). all experiments were done in triplicate.
measurement of active mmp
measurement of active  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in human tissue
extracts and pleural and pericardial effusion was undertaken
using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) kits (amersham life science, burlingame,
usa).
western blot
mmp protein was detected by monoclonal antibodies against
the proenzyme and active  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  (calbiochem,

www.heartjnl.com

san diego, california, usa), employing a standard western
blot technique.8
rna isolation: cdna synthesis and quantitative rt-pcr
total rna from myocardial tissue was isolated according to
the rneasy protocol from qiagen (hilden, germany) and
converted to cdna using a commercially available kit from
promega (madison, wisconsin, usa). the polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) mimic construction kit from clontech (palo
alto, california, usa) was used to produce a dna fragment of
known size and amount, with primer binding sites for the
housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase
( xxxg861xxx ) as previously reported.10 to normalise cdna
samples, a competitive pcr from the housekeeping gene
 xxxg861xxx  was undertaken using this competitor fragment,
under conditions reported before.10 separate reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (rt-pcr) from 2 µl
of the equilibrated cdna were done using the  xxxg861xxx  primer
pair (forward: 5′agc cac atc gct cag aac ac; reverse
5′gag gca ttg ctg atg atc ttg, patent pending) and the
primer specified in table 1. the resulting pcr products were
separated on 2.0% agarose gel. the mmp mrna results are
given in arbitrary units expressing the videodensitometrically
determined ratio of the mmp to the  xxxg861xxx  rt-pcr products.
data analysis
statistical analysis was done using microsoft excel data
analysis software and spss (spss inc, chicago, illinois, usa).
differences in the mean value were considered significant at a
probability value of p < 0.05. values are presented as mean
(sd). student’s t test was used to compare baseline characteristics between groups.

results
 xxxg1440xxx  activity and mass in failing myocardium
human cardiac mmps showed gelatinolytic activity in several
bands on the overnight incubated, coomassie stained, gelatine
enriched sds-page gel. from the known molecular weights
of the active forms of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx , the gelatinolytic
bands of the purified proteins  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx , and
protein detection using western blot analysis, active  xxxg1428xxx 
could be identified as  xxxd2907xxx  kda band and  xxxg1440xxx  as an 86 kda
band at zymography (fig 1). bands observed in some cases at
92 and 72 kda should be regarded as gelatinolytic active
enzymes, fragments, and proenzymes, partially activated by
interaction with sds-page components.
concentrations of active forms of  xxxg1440xxx  measured by
elisa, as well as the gelatinolytic activity of  xxxg1440xxx , were
found to be increased in myocardium from patients with
idcm and coronary artery disease in comparison with the
activity in non-failing hearts (table 2). the active form of
 xxxg1428xxx  and its gelatinolytic activity were increased in idcm
hearts, but there were no significant differences in  xxxg1428xxx 
determinations between non-failing and coronary diseased
myocardium.

source of increased mmp activity
expression of  xxxg1428xxx  mrna measured by quantitative
rt-pcr showed no significant differences between coronary
artery disease, idcm, and non-failing myocardium (table 3).
with respect to  xxxg1440xxx  expression, no increase could be
detected in coronary artery disease and idcm myocardium in
comparison with non-failing myocardium. in coronary artery
disease,  xxxg1440xxx  mrna expression was detectable only by a
highly sensitive nested pcr.
except for the expression of  xxxg1418xxx  in one patient with
idcm, we could not detect  xxxg1418xxx  or  xxxg1437xxx  expression in
any of the diseased myocardium samples or in non-failing
myocardium. timp-2 was highly expressed in all groups, with

a tendency to increased expression in the diseased hearts. this
did not reach significance because of the highly scattered data
in both the idcm and the coronary artery disease groups.
effects of captopril, lisinopril, and ramiprilate on
human  xxxg1440xxx  in vitro
the inhibitory capacity of each ace inhibitor on the mmps was
titrated. figure 2 shows a representative example of dose
dependent inhibition of zymographic activity by captopril. to
compare the inhibitory effects of different ace inhibitors on
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in vitro, we titrated mmp inhibition of
each ace inhibitor until the gelatinolytic activity in zymography gel had disappeared. untreated controls were regarded as

having 100% activity. table 4 shows the ace inhibitor
concentration that inhibits 50% of the gelatinolytic activity
(ic50). owing to the methodological characteristics of zymography and the fact that we used heart extracts containing several
gelatinolytic enzymes, fragments, and activated proenzymes
rather than purified enzymes, the ic50 value is only approximate.
captopril and ramiprilate significantly inhibited  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  activity in vitro, while lisinopril inhibited  xxxg1440xxx  but
not  xxxg1428xxx  (table 4). inhibition of mmp activity was blunted by
excess zinc.

discussion
the extracellular matrix (ecm) is responsible for cardiac cell
alignment and myocardial structural integrity. synthesis and
degradation of ecm are balanced and tightly controlled in normal myocardium.11 12 in pathophysiological processes, an imbalance of proteinase/antiproteinase systems occurs, resulting in

have been implicated in the proteolytic process. as collagen represents the major structural protein of ecm, it has long been
postulated that collagenolytic mmp plays a pivotal role in
cardiac remodelling. inhibition of the proteolytic activity of
mmp has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target in
various diseases, including heart failure.13–21
the data we present here show different regulatory patterns
of mmp depending on the underlying aetiology of heart failure.  xxxg1440xxx  upregulation is a common feature of matrix activation in terminal heart failure, irrespective of the underlying
disease, whereas in our study  xxxg1428xxx  was upregulated only in
idcm and remained unchanged in coronary artery
disease—in line with a previous report.22
the fact that we could not detect increased mmp mrna
expression in failing myocardium suggests the presence of
additional regulatory mechanisms. in particular, the strikingly
low mrna expression of  xxxg1440xxx  in coronary diseased
myocardium compared with normal myocardium contrasts
with the large amount of activated  xxxg1440xxx  measured by
elisa. a possible explanation for this phenomenon is the circadian synthesis of mmp, with inactive proenzymes kept in
stock, implying a chronological imbalance between mmp
synthesis and activation.23 24
sources of mmp are fibroblasts, myocytes, endothelial cells,
and infiltrating inflammatory cells.12 25 monocytes stimulated
by  xxxg2296xxx , which have been found to be
increased in heart failure, are capable of expressing  xxxg1440xxx .26–28 it is possible that these cells may serve as carriers of
 xxxg1440xxx  synthesised before they infiltrate the myocardium.
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that in reperfusion of infarcted myocardium, infiltrating neutrophils are
the predominant source of  xxxg1440xxx  and activating enzymes.25
the source and regulation of mmp activity in normal and diseased myocardium, with a focus on  xxxg1440xxx  in coronary artery
disease, warrants further investigation.
another interesting question arises: what is the result of the
abundant  xxxg1440xxx  in the myocardium in coronary artery
disease and idcm? heart failure is a progressive disease.
 xxxg1440xxx  is a key enzyme in matrix component degradation,
suggesting a role in matrix remodelling that results in left
ventricular enlargement and depression of systolic function.
some of the known substrates of  xxxg1440xxx  are collagen
fragments, gelatin, elastin,  xxxg33xxx ,  xxxg2407xxx , and fibronectin. some of these have important roles in the remodelling
process.  xxxg1440xxx  has been implicated in angiogenesis and
apoptosis.16 29 30 rouet-benzineb and colleagues localised
 xxxg1440xxx  immunohistochemically in cardiomyocytes and
showed myosin heavy chain cleavage by  xxxg1440xxx  in vitro, suggesting a direct impairment of the contractile apparatus by
 xxxg1440xxx .31 there is increasing evidence in studies from
transgenic animals that mmp mediates crucial steps in the
development of heart failure. the fact that  xxxg1440xxx  knockout
mice survive with no apparent defect has been related to
redundancy—expression of related proteins covering for the

same function is assumed.32 33 as the disease progresses, the
knockout animals show a decreased ability to adapt or
compensate. after experimental myocardial infarction in an
 xxxg1440xxx  knockout model, it was convincingly shown that the
targeted deletion of  xxxg1440xxx  attenuated left ventricular
enlargement and collagen accumulation.32 in another mouse
myocardial infarction model it was found that  xxxg1440xxx 
deficiency protected against cardiac rupture.34
except for ace inhibitors, no other drugs used in the care of
heart failure patients have been shown to inhibit mmp activity directly. however, the mmp inhibitory capacity of ace
inhibitors determined by zymographic assay in vitro is not
easily transferable to the situation in vivo. there are no data on
tissue ace inhibitor concentrations in human heart, but
selective enrichment of ace inhibitors has been assumed.35
concentrations of ace inhibitors in zymography are necessarily higher than in blood owing to the need to permeate the
sds-page gel. other technical points should be mentioned,
such as different solubility, different ph, and the application of
active metabolites of prodrugs (such as ramiprilate in place of
ramipril). however, a non-specific effect of ace inhibitors on
mmp can be excluded by its reversibility by an excess of zinc.
the finding of a direct inhibitory effect of ace inhibitors on
mmp in vitro is of uncertain clinical relevance. the course of
the proteolytic activity in the human disease process—from
starter event to end stage heart failure—remains unknown.
the question of timing arises; do ace inhibitors affect remodelling more in the earlier stages or in the end stage of heart
failure? do patients who do not respond to ace inhibition
predominantly develop end stage heart failure requiring
transplantation?
conclusions
no definitive statement on the relevance of the interaction of
ace inhibitors and the mmp system is possible. in considering the assumed influence of ace inhibitors on mmp, we have
emphasised the differences in mmp inhibiting capacity
between the various different ace inhibitors.
