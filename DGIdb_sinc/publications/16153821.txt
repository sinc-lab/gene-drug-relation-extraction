abstract
 xxxd2798xxx  is a new selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator (serm) that is being developed for the treatment of urogenital atrophy and
osteoporosis. similarly to other serms,  xxxd2798xxx  exhibits antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue, which led to the hypothesis that it may be
a potential breast cancer chemopreventive agent. we first assessed the ability of  xxxd2798xxx , compared to tamoxifen and raloxifene, to prevent
dimethylbenzanthracene (dmba)-induced mammary tumors in female sencar mice.  xxxd2798xxx  (n = 18), tamoxifen (n = 20) and raloxifene
(n = 17), each dosed at 50 mg/kg, were administered daily by oral gavage, in combination with 20 ␮g dmba for the first 6 weeks. control mice
(n = 21) received vehicle plus dmba only for the first 6 weeks. daily treatment then continued for 37 weeks. as hypothesized,  xxxd2798xxx 
greatly reduced the incidence of mammary carcinomas compared to control mice (p = 0.003), similar to tamoxifen (p = 0.0004); however,
in the raloxifene group, no significant effect was seen in mammary tumor prevention (p = 0.20). a follow-up study comparing  xxxd2798xxx 
(n = 20) to tamoxifen (n = 20) in the same model was then performed to confirm the results of the first study. the results of the follow-up study,
which extended the treatment to 52 weeks, confirmed the results of our previous study, with  xxxd2798xxx  (p = 0.01) and tamoxifen (p = 0.004)
significantly decreasing mammary carcinomas compared to controls. the results of these two studies suggest that women taking  xxxd2798xxx 
for osteoporosis and/or urogenital atrophy may further benefit from  xxxd2798xxx ’s breast cancer chemopreventive effects.

1. introduction
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) are a
unique class of compounds that induce structural changes
in the  xxxg730xxx  (er), which lead to either an estrogen agonistic response or an estrogen antagonistic response,
depending both on the target tissue and the pharmacological
activity of a particular serm [1–4]. the goal in serm development, especially for prophylactic use in healthy women,

is to design a compound with specific target tissue activity,
which would optimize the beneficial effects of the drug and
minimize the adverse effects. for example, the ideal serm
would have er antagonistic effects on breast tissue while
having estrogenic or agonistic effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, and neutral effects on the endometrium.
the activity of serms is thought to be regulated through
two ers, er-␣ and er-␤. the ligands, or serms, diffuse into the cell and bind to either er-␣ or -␤, causing
a conformational change, which results in receptor dimerization. this promotes the interaction of the receptor with
the promoter regions of the dna, causing either a tran-

scriptional activation or repression of estrogen target genes
[5].
tamoxifen, the first clinically useful serm, is a triphenylethylene (fig. 1) that has been used for the treatment
of breast cancer for over 25 years [6–9]. as a result of
tamoxifen’s clinical activity in breast cancer, the national
surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project’s (nsabp)
breast cancer prevention trial was initiated to evaluate
tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent. the trial showed
tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49%
and noninvasive breast cancer by 50%, ultimately resulting
in fda approval of tamoxifen for reducing the risk of breast
cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease
[10,11].
raloxifene is a benzothiophene serm (fig. 1) that has
been approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, and similar to tamoxifen, is associated with several
adverse effects including hot flashes, leg cramps, influenzalike symptoms and thromboembolic events [12,13]. however,
unlike tamoxifen, it has not been associated with an increased
risk of endometrial cancer, which is most likely a result of
its clinically insignificant effects in the endometrium [12].
though raloxifene is approved to treat osteoporosis, it is now
being evaluated for chemopreventive effects on breast cancer as a result of its antiestrogenic activity in breast tissue
[12].
 xxxd2798xxx , a triphenylethylene compound, is currently
in phase iii trials for the treatment of urogenital atrophy
and secondarily for the prevention of osteoporosis (fig. 1)
[14,15]. phases i and ii trials have demonstrated that

231

 xxxd2798xxx  is well tolerated in healthy postmenopausal
women [15–18]. though it has primarily been studied for
its effects on improving bone mass and inhibiting bone
loss,  xxxd2798xxx  has also been shown to have antiestrogenic
effects on breast tissue [14].  xxxd2798xxx  appears to have few
clinically significant side effects. unlike tamoxifen which
acts as an estrogen agonist in endometrial tissue,  xxxd2798xxx 
has been shown to have neutral effects in the endometrium
at clinically relevant doses [15–17].  xxxd2798xxx  treatment does not result in a high incidence of side effects
commonly associated with tamoxifen and raloxifene, such
as hot flashes, insomnia [15–17], nervousness, dizziness,
melancholy, weakness, joint or muscle pain, headache,
breast tenderness or skin itch [17].  xxxd2798xxx  also has a
significant estrogenic effect in vaginal tissue [15,17], and
unlike other serms, does not cause vaginal dryness [15,16].
furthermore, to date, no thromboembolic complications
have been reported [16], which is a common fear among
patients receiving hormonal therapies. with the decline in
hormone replacement therapy (hrt) use following the report
from the women’s health initiative (whi) study that hrt
increases the incidence of breast cancer [19],  xxxd2798xxx 
may also provide an alternative to postmenopausal women
seeking hormonal therapies. given the overall tolerability
of  xxxd2798xxx  and its antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue,
it is important to determine whether  xxxd2798xxx  may be a
good candidate for breast cancer chemoprevention.

2.2. chemoprevention studies
to compare the chemopreventive effects of  xxxd2798xxx ,
tamoxifen, and raloxifene on er-positive breast tumors, we
have modified established dmba mouse models [20,21] to
chemically induce mammary carcinoma. in our study, sencar
mice were given a daily dose of dmba for 6 weeks to induce
carcinogenesis, and mpa, formulated as a slow release pellet, to promote mammary tumor formation. sencar mice were
chosen because they are sensitive to carcinogens; however,
they develop dmba-induced mammary tumors at a much
slower rate than rats, which more closely resembles human
carcinogenesis. because there is such a long (approximately
1 year) latency period for dmba-induced mammary tumor
development in mice, it is desirable in studies such as these
to obtain control tumors in less time. to accomplish this, we
used the synthetic progestin mpa, which has been reported
to accelerate the formation of mammary tumors following
the administration of dmba [21]. tumor incidence and histology were then compared among treatment groups. the
er status of the tumors was determined, as serms have
only been shown to be effective in er-positive tumors. drug
distribution of  xxxd2798xxx  and its metabolites was assessed
using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc).
to confirm the results observed in our first study in regard
to the prevention of mammary carcinomas, a follow-up study
was performed. this study was designed as described above,
except for the treatment groups, which were  xxxd2798xxx ,
tamoxifen and control.
2.2.1. animals
female sencar mice were purchased from the national
cancer institute (bethesda, md). eighty-one mice arrived
at about 40 days of age, and were housed in 19 cages of
four, except for two cages, one with three mice and the other
with two. all cages were kept in a room maintained at constant temperature and humidity with a 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle. all mice received free access to water and purina
laboratory rodent diet (richmond, in). the rodent diet
consisted of not less than 23% crude protein, 4.5% crude
fat, 6.0% crude fiber, 8% ash and 2.5% minerals. the specific components of the diet include the following: ground
corn, dehulled soybean meal, dried beet pulp, fish meal,
ground oats, brewers dried yeast, cane molasses, dehydrated
alfalfa meal, dried whey, wheat germ, porcine meat meal,
wheat middlings, animal fat preserved with bha, salt, calcium carbonate, choline chloride, cholecalciferol,  xxxd3105xxx 
acetate,  xxxd2146xxx , pyridoxine hydrochloride, dl-methionine,
thiamine mononitrate, calcium pantothenate,  xxxd2715xxx ,
dl alpha  xxxd3389xxx , cyanocobalamin, riboflavin, ferrous sulfate, manganous oxide, zinc oxide, ferrous carbonate, copper sulfate,  xxxd3557xxx , calcium iodate and cobalt
carbonate. the total metabolizable energy in this diet was
3.04 kcal/g.
in the follow-up study, 63 female sencar mice, 30 days of
age, were housed in 15 cages of four and one cage of three

mice. housing conditions and feed were identical to those
described above.
2.2.2. pellet implantation
the mice were allowed to acclimate to their surroundings
for 1 week prior to mpa pellet implantation, which occurred
at 47 days of age (37 days of age in the follow-up study).
mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneally injecting 0.4 ml
of the anesthetic tribromoethanol (avertin® ), which was prepared by dissolving tribromoethanol in 2-methyl-2-butanol
and water, then sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 ␮m
millipore filter. once mice were sedated, the neck area was
shaved with rodent clippers then cleaned with 70% ethanol. a
small incision was then made vertically through the first layers of skin using a pair of sterile scissors. using forceps, two
pockets were created on either side of the incision. two mpa
pellets (20 mg each) were then inserted, one in each pouch, to
act as tumor promoters to accelerate the formation of tumors.
the incisions were then closed with wound clips. following
a 10 day healing period, the wound clips were removed.
2.2.3. animal treatments
the mice (57 days old) were weighed and assigned to
cages to maintain an average weight per cage (approximately 33 g). the cages were then randomly divided into
four groups: control (n = 21), tamoxifen (n = 20), raloxifene
(n = 17) and  xxxd2798xxx  (n = 18). for the first 6 weeks of
treatment, all mice received 20 ␮g/day dmba in combination with 50 mg/(kg day) tamoxifen, raloxifene or  xxxd2798xxx 
delivered by oral gavage. the control mice received vehicle
plus dmba. the drugs and dmba were dissolved in peanut
oil so that 100 ␮l delivered the appropriate doses. after the
first 6 weeks, dmba treatment was withdrawn, while drug
therapy continued on a daily basis until the conclusion of the
study (approximately 37 weeks total).
in the follow-up study, the average weight of the mice in
each cage was approximately 27 g at 44 days of age. the
cages were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups,
with the cage containing only three mice being placed in the
control group. thus, the treatment groups were composed as
follows: control (n = 23),  xxxd2798xxx  (n = 20) and tamoxifen
(n = 20). daily dosing was performed for a total of approximately 52 weeks.
2.2.4. chemoprevention study design
the mice were weighed weekly in cages for the first 28
weeks, and then once mice rapidly began to develop tumors,
individual mice were weighed on a weekly basis. mice were
evaluated once each week for new mammary tumors by palpation. larger tumors were measured weekly using calipers,
and an approximate volume was calculated using the formula
v = piw2 l/12, where v is volume, calculated by measuring the
width (w), which is the smaller dimension and the length (l),
which is the longer dimension of the tumor. once the tumor(s)
reached the size of 1.5 cm3 , or the tumor was visibly impairing the mobility of the mouse, the mouse was sacrificed.

g.t. wurz et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 97 (2005) 230–240

in the follow-up study, all mice were weighed individually
once a month for the first 16 weeks, and then every 2 weeks
for the remaining 36 weeks of the study. all other procedures
were performed as described above.
2.2.5. terminal procedures
mice were terminated once tumor burden became excessive (see section 2.2.4) or when they appeared to be having
difficulty breathing. otherwise, mice were terminated at the
conclusion of the study. to euthanize, mice were anesthetized
with ether, then whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture and placed into a glass tube containing heparin. the
blood was centrifuged to separate plasma for hplc analysis. following blood collection, the following tissues were
harvested for hplc analysis: liver, uterus, brain, bone and
tumor, if present. a portion of each tumor was retained for
histological examination and for er status determination.
in the follow-up study, mice were sacrificed by carbon
dioxide asphyxiation and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. during necropsy, any tumors or suspicious growths
were removed, preserved in neutral buffered formalin, and
submitted for histological analysis. the following additional
tissues were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
for future study: fat, uterus, liver, spleen, heart, lungs and
brain.
2.3. histology
2.3.1. tissue collection
portions of the tumors were either fixed in neutral buffered
formalin and sent to the university of california, davis comparative pathology laboratory to determine the tumor type
and origin (both studies) or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
for er status determination at the uc davis m.i.n.d. institute (first study).  xxxg730xxx  status was determined by
using immunohistochemistry (ihc) and real-time pcr.
2.3.2. immunohistochemical analysis of hormone
receptor status
tumors were fixed in ph-neutral buffered 4% formalin
(american master tech scientific inc., lodi, ca), embedded
in paraffin, cut into 4 ␮m sections, and stained with mayer’s
hematoxylin and eosin (h&e).
the 4 ␮m paraffin sections were placed onto superfrost/plus slides (fisher), deparaffinized and cleared.
immunohistochemistry was performed after inhibition of
endogenous peroxidase activity in a solution of 3% hydrogen
peroxide (h2 o2 ) in methanol and hydration in graded alcohol to distilled water. before antibody incubations, antigen
retrieval was performed by high temperature (microwave)
incubation in 0.01 m  xxxd1710xxx  buffer (ph 6.0) for 3 × 4 min.
slides were allowed to cool for 10 min in  xxxd1710xxx  buffer
then transferred to pbs (ph 7.4) (2 × 5 min each). ten percent normal horse serum (vector laboratories, burlingame,
ca) was applied to sections and incubated for 20 min in a
humidified chamber at room temperature.

233

immunohistochemistry for er-␣ was performed using
a 1:600 diluted rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (mc20) against the c terminus (the ligand-binding domain) of
murine er-␣. the envision + kit (dako, carpentaria, ca)
was used as an amplification system according to manufacturer’s instructions. slides were covered with primary
antibody solution and were incubated overnight at room temperature. slides were counterstained in mayer’s hematoxylin,
dehydrated, cleared and cover slipped. one negative control
slide per tumor was run without primary antibody. normal
mouse uterus slides were incorporated as positive control for
the antibodies into each run and gave nuclear staining.
2.3.3. real-time pcr
total rna was isolated from 75 to 150 mg of tissue for
each specimen using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) and further purified with rnaeasy silica columns (qiagen, valencia, ca). rna quality was determined utilizing an
agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (agilent technologies, palo alto,
ca), and the ratio of absorbance at lambda = 260 versus lambda = 280
was used to determine purity.
in order to quantify the transcript levels of er-␣ and ␤, we performed real-time taqman® rt-pcr. total rna
from the tumors was used in conjunction with superscript
ii reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (invitrogen) to
generate first strand cdna. for the pcr step, cdna generated from 20 ng of total rna was used in 25 ␮l reactions
with taqman® universal pcr master mix (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) and the corresponding er-␣ and
-␤ sequence-specific primer/probe assay mixes (assays-ondemand, applied biosystems). each reaction was performed
in triplicate according to the default pcr thermal cycling
conditions described in the product protocol. fluorescence
detection was measured utilizing an abi prism 7700 platform (applied biosystems). the endpoint, ct , was identified
by the abi software as the pcr cycle number at which the
signal crosses a specified threshold value.
transcript abundance is directly related to the cycle at
which this threshold is crossed. fold difference was calculated for both er-␣ and -␤, between prelactating and quiescent mammary gland and tumor samples from each treatment
group and control, utilizing the comparative ct method, as
outlined in the abi sequence detector user bulletin #2, and
normalized to an 18s endogenous reference.
2.4. hplc analysis
 xxxd2798xxx  in plasma samples from the first study was
quantified using a previously published bioanalytical method
[22]. tamoxifen in plasma samples was quantified using a
previously published assay [23], with the following changes:
a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used, and the fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 266 nm and an
emission wavelength of 370 nm. raloxifene samples were
not analyzed by hplc due to the lack of availability of a
bioanalytical method.

2.5. statistical analysis
for both studies, fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was used
to calculate p-values for comparing tumor incidence between
the various treatment groups. time to diagnosis of the first
mammary tumor was compared graphically for different
treatment groups using kaplan–meier estimates. statistical
significance for this difference was assessed by the log-rank
test. bonferroni’s adjustment for multiple tests was used to
lessen the likelihood of a false positive result, and the significance level was adjusted to alpha = 0.0167 (three tests) in
the chemoprevention study, and to alpha = 0.025 (two tests) in
the follow-up study. all calculations were performed using
microsoft excel® (redmond, wa) and sas (cary, nc).
statistical significance was assessed only for the mammary
tumors in each study to avoid introducing an overabundance
of tests and thus a greatly reduced significance level.

3. results
3.1. chemoprevention study
to evaluate the effects of  xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen and
raloxifene on the incidence of mammary carcinomas in the
dmba-induced mammary carcinoma mouse model, four
groups of mice were implanted with mpa pellets and were
treated daily by oral gavage for 6 weeks with 20 ␮g dmba,
in combination with 50 mg/(kg day)  xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen
or raloxifene. the control mice were treated with vehicle plus
dmba only. at the end of the first 6 weeks, dmba treatment
was discontinued, however, daily drug treatments continued
until the termination of the study. during the course of dmba
administration, five mice were removed from the study as a
result of infection from mpa pellet implantation (two in the
 xxxd2798xxx  group and three in the raloxifene group). over the
course of this approximately 37-week study, mouse weights
among the treatment groups mostly increased, with the control mice exhibiting the greatest weight gain (fig. 2a). it is
unclear as to the significance of the weight differences, as the
tumor growth may have caused either weight gain or weight
loss.
the first tumor appeared in the control group 14 weeks
into the study, and was discovered by palpation, which was
performed weekly. the design of the study was such that
the control mice were hypothesized to develop the greatest
number of mammary tumors, as they were not administered a
chemopreventive agent. ten of the control mice (48%) developed mammary tumors over the 37-week period. these were
histologically classified: four were solid carcinomas, six were
adenocarcinomas, four were adenosquamous carcinomas and
one was an adenomyoepithelial carcinoma. all were of mammary origin. tumors were analyzed for the presence of er-␣
and -␤ using ihc and real-time pcr (taqman analysis).
for all the mammary carcinomas, er-␣ was negative by ihc.
with taqman analysis, er-␣ was present and expressed at

low levels, with approximately a 22- to 32-fold decrease in
expression as compared to prelactating and quiescent mammary gland, respectively. er-␤ was essentially negative by
taqman analysis for all the mammary tumors.
log-rank tests were used to compare the incidence of
mammary tumors in the  xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen and raloxifene groups to the control group. one  xxxd2798xxx -treated
mouse (6%) developed a mammary tumor, a solid mammary carcinoma, while the tamoxifen-treated mice did not
develop any mammary tumors.  xxxd2798xxx - and tamoxifentreated mice had significantly fewer mammary tumors than
the control mice, p = 0.003 and 0.0004, respectively, indicating significantly longer survival (time to first mammary
tumor) in both treatment groups. the raloxifene group on the
other hand, did not significantly prevent mammary tumors
in this mouse model, as five mice (29%) developed tumors
(p = 0.20). these tumors were all of mammary origin, and one
was a solid carcinoma, two were adenocarcinomas and three
were adenosquamous carcinomas. the mean tumor latency

weekly and mice were sacrificed once tumor volumes exceeded 1 cm3 , or
the health of the mouse appeared to be compromised. survival curves show
 xxxd2798xxx  (p = 0.003) and tamoxifen (p = 0.0004) had a significant chemopreventive effect on mammary tumor development, while raloxifene did
not significantly prevent the development of mammary tumors (p = 0.20).

and tamoxifen (p = 0.004) again had significant chemopreventive effects on
mammary tumor development.

(standard deviation) for the control and raloxifene groups was
22 (4.0) and 26 (5.7) weeks, respectively (fig. 3a). these
results from the log-rank test were consistent with the results
from the fisher’s exact test, where the p-values were 0.005,
0.0005 and 0.33 for the  xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen and raloxifene
groups, respectively.
in addition to mammary tumors, other tumors were discovered through the course of the study, including thymic
lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (fig. 4a). the total
tumor incidence for raloxifene-treated animals was 88%,
which was higher than 39% in  xxxd2798xxx -treated mice,
35% in tamoxifen-treated mice and 52% in the control mice
(fig. 5a). corresponding p-values calculated by fisher’s
exact test were 0.03, 0.52 and 0.35, respectively. the control group had the greatest tumor multiplicity (number of

tumors/mouse in mice with tumors), with an average of 1.9
tumors/mouse, followed by 1.3 tumors/mouse in the raloxifene group. tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx  mice each had 1
tumor/mouse.
the first thymic lymphoma was discovered in week 24,
when a control mouse was found deceased. thymic lymphomas were often predictable by a rapid weight loss, approximately 2 g per week. once this significant weight loss was
evident, mice were terminated, and in all cases, a thymic lymphoma was present. the incidence of thymic lymphomas was
similar across treatment groups (fig. 4a), with fisher’s exact
test p-values of 0.70, 1 and 1 in the tamoxifen,  xxxd2798xxx  and
raloxifene groups, respectively. this indicates that dmba
is likely the agent responsible for this tumor type. it has
been previously documented that lymphomas are a side
effect of dmba treatment in this mouse model and the
ratio of mammary carcinomas to thymic lymphomas is a
result of the dose. a low dose (20 ␮g/day), which is the
dose used in this study, results in low lymphoma incidence,
while optimizing the incidence of mammary carcinomas
[20].
ovarian tumors first began to appear in raloxifenetreated mice in week 31. though most ovarian tumors never
reached a size where they were palpable or visible prior to
necropsy, some mice did have palpable masses and a darkened abdomen. these mice were terminated once this was
observed, and very large ovarian tumors were discovered.

mice were monitored for palpable tumors, and were sacrificed once tumor
volumes exceeded 1 cm3 , or the health of the mouse appeared to be compromised. raloxifene-treated animals had substantially more tumors at the
completion of the 37-week study than in mice treated with  xxxd2798xxx  or
tamoxifen. (b) effects of  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen on the incidence of total
tumors in the follow-up study. error bars represent standard error.

these tumors were also tested for er-␣ and -␤. there was
patchy nuclear er-␣ positivity by ihc. with taqman analysis, er-␣ showed higher expression than in the mammary
tumors, at nearly equivalent levels of transcript as compared
to the prelactating and quiescent mammary gland. for these
ovarian tumors, there was no apparent difference in er-␣
expression between treatment groups with either ihc or taqman. taqman analysis for er-␤ showed high levels in all the
ovarian tumors. raloxifene had a substantially higher ovarian tumor incidence (71%), compared to tamoxifen (10%)
and  xxxd2798xxx  (17%). corresponding fisher’s exact test pvalues for the raloxifene, tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx  groups
were 0.000002, 0.23 and 0.09, respectively. the significance
level in this study was p = 0.0167. no ovarian tumors were
seen in the control group (fig. 4a).

several other tumor types were seen, though the significance of these is not known. one  xxxd2798xxx  mouse had
an invasive liver sarcoma, and a squamous cell carcinoma
was discovered on the forestomach of a tamoxifen mouse. a
histocytic sarcoma was present on the abdomen of a raloxifene mouse, and a mass on the back of a control mouse was
determined to be a sarcoma of unknown origin (fig. 4a).
hplc was used to verify the dosing of  xxxd2798xxx ,
which was found at clinically relevant concentrations in the
plasma (table 1). the median plasma concentration in the
 xxxd2798xxx -treated mice was 38.4 ng/ml. the major metabolite of  xxxd2798xxx , osp vi (fig. 6), was also quantified in this
assay, and the median plasma concentration was 35.6 ng/ml.
although a broad range of concentrations was seen for both
 xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen, all mice in these treatment groups
had detectable drug levels. the distribution of  xxxd2798xxx 
showed no specificity and was detected in all tissues tested,
which include the liver, brain, bone, uterus and tumor tissue,
with the highest levels of the parent compound detected in
the liver, followed by plasma. no  xxxd2798xxx  or  xxxd2798xxx 
metabolites were detected in the control mice. osp vi could
not be quantified in the tissues, due to a peak seen in several
control mice with an overlapping retention time.
3.2. follow-up study
in the follow-up study conducted to confirm the chemopreventive effects of tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx  with respect
to mammary carcinomas, 63 mice were divided into three
treatment groups: control,  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen. the
study design, procedures and dosages were as described for
the first study, except that this study ran for a year (52 weeks).
as observed in our first study, the average weight of control
group mice in this study was consistently higher than in the
tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx  groups, which remained very similar throughout the study (fig. 2b). the differences in average
weight between the control and treated groups became apparent by 8 weeks of treatment, and were maintained throughout
the study. again, the significance of this weight difference is
unclear.
the first mammary carcinoma was observed in the control
group during week 19 of treatment, 13 weeks after the discontinuation of dmba administration (fig. 3b). the control
group had the greatest number of mammary tumors, with 13
out of 23 control mice (57%) developing mammary carci-

briefly, mice received 20 ␮g dmba in combination with 50 mg/(kg day) tamoxifen,  xxxd2798xxx , or raloxifene for 6 weeks. drug therapy then continued on a
daily basis until the conclusion of the study. mice were sacrificed and tissues and plasma samples were collected. hplc was used to quantify drug levels in all
groups except raloxifene. the average serm concentration (standard deviation) from each group is reported in the table.

nomas. a total of 16 mammary carcinomas were observed
in the control group, 11 of which were classified as mammary gland carcinomas and two of which were classified as
mammary adenocarcinomas. the mean latency (±standard
deviation) of these tumors was 37.4 ± 9.8 weeks, an average
of 15 weeks longer than in the first study. by comparison,
 xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen once again appeared to exert a sig-

nificant breast cancer chemopreventive effect in this mouse
model, with only one mammary tumor (5%), a mammary
gland carcinoma, being observed in the  xxxd2798xxx  group
and none in the tamoxifen group. the single mammary tumor
observed in the  xxxd2798xxx  group was detected following 39
weeks of treatment. as assessed by the log-rank test, mice in
the  xxxd2798xxx - (p = 0.01) and tamoxifen-treated (p = 0.004)

238

groups developed significantly fewer mammary tumors compared to the control group. these results were confirmed
by fisher’s exact test, where the p-values were 0.0003 and
0.00003, respectively. as in the first study, the results suggest that the  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen treatment groups had
significantly longer survival (time to first mammary tumor).
ovarian tumors and lymphomas were also observed
among the treatment groups, as in the previous study. however, unlike the first study, an ovarian tumor, detected during
week 35, was observed in the control group of this study
(4% incidence). in the  xxxd2798xxx  group, a total of six mice
(30%; p = 0.04) developed ovarian tumors, the first during
week 37, compared to five in the tamoxifen group (25%;
p = 0.08), where the first ovarian tumor was observed in week
42. although both  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen did not reach
significance (p < 0.0167), a trend suggested both agents were
associated with ovarian cancer following prolonged administration. the incidence of ovarian tumors among the respective
study groups is shown in fig. 4b.
for lymphomas, a total of four mice in the control group
(17%), eight mice in the  xxxd2798xxx  group (40%) and
six mice in the tamoxifen group (30%) developed tumors
(fig. 4b). the first lymphoma was found in a tamoxifen
mouse in week 14. this result, similar to the first study where
the incidence of lymphomas was roughly equal among the
study groups, provides further evidence that the observed
lymphomas are likely due to dmba exposure.
the incidence of tumors of any type was similar between
the control and the  xxxd2798xxx - and tamoxifen-treated
groups. total tumor incidence for the control,  xxxd2798xxx 
and tamoxifen groups was 78, 80 and 60%, respectively
(fig. 5b). fisher’s exact test showed p-values of 0.32 and
1 for the tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx  groups, respectively.
these data suggest that  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen significantly reduced the incidence of mammary carcinomas while
not increasing the incidence of other cancers, confirming the
results from the first study. average tumor multiplicities for
the control,  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen groups were 1.4, 1.2
and 1.3 tumors/mouse in mice with tumors, respectively.
there were several types of tumors other than mammary, lymphoma, or ovarian found during the course of
the follow-up study (fig. 4b). in the control group, three
mice developed lung tumors, two of which were low-grade
bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas, and one of which was a
bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma, a common incidental finding
in mice. one of the control mice with a bronchiolo-alveolar
carcinoma also developed a highly aggressive spindle cell
sarcoma in the outer ear. in the  xxxd2798xxx  group, one
mouse had an undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown origin in its abdomen, and another mouse had a squamous
cell carcinoma of the stomach, possibly related to long-term
daily gavaging. in the tamoxifen group, another mouse with
an abdominal carcinoma of unknown origin was seen, in
addition to a mouse found to be suffering from myeloid
leukemia. the significance of these additional tumors is
unknown.

4. discussion
two separate studies were conducted to determine the
ability of  xxxd2798xxx  compared to tamoxifen to prevent
development of dmba-induced mammary carcinoma in a
sencar mouse model. the first, comparing  xxxd2798xxx  to
tamoxifen and raloxifene, ran for a period of 37 weeks. to
verify the effects of  xxxd2798xxx  observed in the first study, a
second, longer-term (52 weeks) study comparing  xxxd2798xxx 
to tamoxifen was performed. in both studies,  xxxd2798xxx  and
tamoxifen were able to prevent the development of mammary
tumors, as hypothesized.
in our study, raloxifene did not provide a preventive effect
on mammary tumors. this study is supported by two clinical
trials suggesting that raloxifene is not an effective treatment for breast cancer [24,25]. in addition, our study showed
that raloxifene treatment dramatically increases the incidence
of ovarian tumors in mice, but the significance of this is
unknown, as metabolic profiles differ among species, and this
occurrence may be limited to rodents. in our studies, only one
ovarian tumor was found in the control animals (n = 44), suggesting that dmba is probably not the agent responsible for
their formation. it is more likely that this effect was, in fact,
pharmacologically induced by raloxifene. previous studies
support this finding, reporting that raloxifene causes ovarian
tumors in rats following chronic dosing [26,27] and supports
the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro [28], however,
this effect has not been observed in postmenopausal human
patients [29].
several ovarian tumors were also seen in the  xxxd2798xxx 
and tamoxifen-treated animals in both studies, again suggesting pharmacological induction, but the differences between
these two treatments and control animals were not as profound as the difference between control and raloxifene.
we did, however, observe a trend toward increased ovarian
tumors in the  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen-treated groups of
both studies, and this effect may be associated with the cumulative dose of the agents administered.
although the  xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen and raloxifene doses
used in these studies (50 mg/(kg day)) were high compared
to typical human doses of tamoxifen (20 mg/day, or approximately 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg woman), raloxifene (60 mg/day,
or about 0.9 mg/kg), or  xxxd2798xxx  (60 mg/day), tamoxifen
is known to be metabolized at a much higher rate in mice
than in humans [30]. in humans, the terminal elimination
half-life of tamoxifen is approximately 5–7 days [31], while
in mice it is only about 12 h [30]. similarly,  xxxd2798xxx 
also has a shorter elimination half-life in mice compared to
humans, in whom the half-life is approximately 25 h [32].
for raloxifene, the elimination half-life in humans is approximately 28 h [31], and it is much shorter in rats (6.6 h) [33].
thus, in order to compensate for the increased metabolism,
50 mg/kg was chosen as the dose for all three compounds. in previous studies of tamoxifen and  xxxd2798xxx ,
we have found this dose to be well tolerated in mice
[34].

g.t. wurz et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 97 (2005) 230–240

although serms are thought to act through er in preventing mammary carcinoma, we also considered a potential metabolic mechanism. since dmba is a procarcinogen
that requires metabolic activation [35], it is possible that
 xxxd2798xxx , tamoxifen and raloxifene could have affected
this process, altering the ultimate carcinogenicity of dmba
in the treated animals. however, the fact that the incidence
of lymphomas, which are known to be associated with the
administration of dmba in mice [20], was similar across
all groups in both studies suggests that the carcinogenicity
of dmba in the treated versus the control groups was similar. furthermore, the cytochrome p450 isoforms involved in
the metabolic activation of dmba ( xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx )
[35] are not known to play a role in the metabolism of tamoxifen, which is primarily metabolized by the  xxxg590xxx  family
and cyp2d6 [31], or  xxxd2798xxx , which is primarily metabolized by cyp3a4 (unpublished data). the incidence of
cancers other than mammary, ovarian and lymphoma were
also roughly equal in the control and treated groups, except
for raloxifene, suggesting that the chemopreventive effects
of  xxxd2798xxx  and tamoxifen in this model are specific for
mammary carcinoma.
in our studies, it was noted that the average weight of
the control mice was consistently higher than in the treated
groups throughout the course of the studies. while the significance of this observation is unclear, a difference between
the control and treated groups in the toxic dose of dmba
administered is unlikely. it is much more likely that the various antiestrogens used are associated with the lower average
weights in the treated groups, which may be a hormonally
associated side effect.
in conclusion,  xxxd2798xxx  significantly reduced the incidence of mammary tumors, similar to tamoxifen, in mice.
this finding, coupled with the positive clinical phases i–ii
data, supports the further clinical development of  xxxd2798xxx .
