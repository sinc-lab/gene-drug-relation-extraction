involvement of atp-sensitive potassium channels in proliferation and differentiation of rat preadipocytes.  this paper was aimed to investigate the effects of atp-sensitive potassium channels on the proliferation and differentiation of rat preadipocytes. we examined the expression of sulphonylurea receptor 2 ( xxxg20xxx ) mrna in preadipocytes and adipocytes obtained by inducing for 5 d and the effects of the inhibitor ( xxxd2215xxx ) and opener ( xxxd1868xxx ) of atp-sensitive potassium channels on the expression of  xxxg20xxx  mrna in preadipocytes by real-time pcr. preadipocyte proliferation and cell cycle were measured by mtt spectrophotometry and flow cytometer. the content of intracellular lipid was measured by oil red o staining, cell diameter was determined by image-pro plus 5.0 software and the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ) mrna was estimated by rt-pcr.  xxxg20xxx  mrna was expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes obtained by inducing for 5 d, and the expression in adipocytes was obviously higher than that in preadipocytes.  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited the expression of  xxxg20xxx  mrna in preadipocyte, promoted preadipocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, increased the cell percentages in g(2)/m + s phase, increased lipid content, augmented adipocyte diameter, and promoted the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna. but the actions of  xxxd1868xxx  were contrary to those of  xxxd2215xxx . these results suggest that atp-sensitive potassium channels regulate the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes, and  xxxg1807xxx  is probably involved in the effect of atp-sensitive potassium channels.
