abstract  xxxd3148xxx  ( xxxd3148xxx ®) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist developed for the once daily treatment of
parkinson’s disease (pd) using a transdermal delivery
system (patch) which provides patients with the drug
continuously over 24 h. to fully understand the pharmacological actions of  xxxd3148xxx , the present study determined
its extended receptor profile. in standard binding assays,
 xxxd3148xxx  demonstrated the highest affinity for dopamine
receptors, particularly the  xxxg657xxx  (ki =
0.71 nm) with its affinities to other dopamine receptors
being (ki in nm): d4.2 (3.9), d4.7 (5.9), d5 (5.4), d2 (13.5),
d4.4 (15), and d1 (83). significant affinities were also
demonstrated  xxxd2216xxx -adrenergic (alpha2b, ki = 27 nm) and
serotonin receptors (5-ht1a ki =30 nm). in newly developed reporter-gene assays for determination of functional

activity,  xxxd3148xxx  behaved as a full agonist at dopamine
receptors (rank order: d3 >d2l >d1 =d5 >d4.4) with potencies 2,600 and 53 times higher than dopamine at dopamine
d3 and d2l receptors, respectively.  xxxd2216xxx -adrenergic sites,
 xxxd3148xxx  acted as an antagonist on alpha2b receptors. at
serotonergic sites,  xxxd3148xxx  had a weak but significant
agonistic activity at 5-ht1a receptors and a minor or
nonexistent activity at other serotonin receptors. thus, in
respect to pd,  xxxd3148xxx  can be characterized as a specific
dopamine receptor agonist with a preference for the d3
receptor over d2 and d1 receptors. in addition, it exhibits
interaction with d4 and d5 receptors, the role of which in
relation to pd is not clear yet. among non-dopaminergic
sites,  xxxd3148xxx  shows relevant affinity to only 5-ht1a and
alpha2b receptors. further studies are necessary to investigate
the contribution of the different receptor subtypes to the
efficacy of  xxxd3148xxx  in parkinson’s disease and possible
other indications such as restless legs syndrome.

introduction
since the discovery that patients with parkinson’s disease
(pd) exhibit a dopamine deficiency in the striatum,
research has focused on the development of dopaminergic
drugs for the treatment of the disease. levodopa was the
first of these drugs and is remarkably effective for reversing
akinetic symptoms (cotzias 1971; sit 2000). this agent has
been in use for over 40 years and continues to be the most
widely prescribed drug for the disease (sit 2000; tan et al.
2005). however, despite its substantial efficacy over the

74

short-term, levodopa is not an ideal therapy. after longterm use, the response to levodopa diminishes and most
patients experience extreme fluctuations in efficacy (“on–
off” phenomenon) and disabling motor complications
(dyskinesia; fahn 1999).
in order to improve the therapy of pd, a number of
dopamine agonists have been developed. many of these
were developed to replace levodopa with the additional
goal of providing a more continuous dopaminergic stimulation. that treatment regimen is considered to avoid the
motor complications which are believed to be associated
with pulsatile administration of dopaminergic drugs (fahn
1999; maratos et al. 2003; olanow and obeso 2000).
clinical trials have confirmed that the treatment of patients
with early pd with dopamine agonists is effective,
potentially neuroprotective, and by delaying the use of, or
reducing, levodopa therapy, can avoid the motor complications (clarke and guttman 2002; jenner 2003; rascol et al.
2002).
 xxxd3148xxx  ([−]2-(n-propyl-n-2-thienylethylamino)-5hydroxytetralin, previously known as  xxxd3148xxx ) is a new
drug developed for the once daily treatment of idiopathic
pd (fig. 1). due to its extensive gastrointestinal metabolism
(swart and de zeeuw 1992),  xxxd3148xxx  is poorly suited for
oral administration. however, its high lipid solubility and
other physiochemical properties suggested its development
for a transdermal administration (e.g., via a patch). preclinical studies with  xxxd3148xxx  have demonstrated potent effects
in rat and monkey models of pd (belluzzi et al. 1994) even
after transdermal administration as well as neuroprotective
properties (scheller et al. 2007). clinical trials have shown
that once-daily  xxxd3148xxx  patch application provides doserelated improvements in patients’ motor function (parkinson
study group 2003; watts et al. 2004). moreover, a stable
drug release profile was maintained throughout the
24-h period that the patch was in place resulting in stable
plasma levels and providing the basis for a potential
continuous dopaminergic stimulation (metman et al. 2001).
in order to characterize its pharmacologic properties in
detail, the interaction of  xxxd3148xxx  with a broad range of
receptors, transporters, and ion channels was investigated.
cell-based functional assays were developed to characterize its
functional properties regarding dopaminergic, serotonergic,
and adrenergic receptors.

cell lines
every recombinant receptor was expressed in chinese
hamster ovary cell lines (cho-dukx) except for the d3
receptor, which was expressed in human neuroblastoma cell
lines (sh-sy5y). all human receptor cdnas were cloned
from human preparations by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) with sequence-specific primers covering the start and stop codons, respectively, using
high-fidelity dna polymerases (pfu turbo, stratagene, la
jolla, ca, usa; platinum pfx, invitrogen, san diego, ca,
usa). cdna inserts were directionally subcloned into the
expression vector pcineo (promega, mannheim, germany)
and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences (including a kozak sequence gcc a/g ccc atg in front of
the start codon) were in accordance with those published in
genbank (d1: s58541, d2l: m29066, d3: u32499, d4.4:
l12398, and d5: m67439). expression plasmids were
introduced into eukaryotic cells (cho-dukx-cre,
cho-dukx-sre, or sh-sy5y-sre) harboring the luciferase reporter gene driven 5× cre- or 2× sre elements
(corresponding to −357 to −276 from the c-fos gene in front
of a minimal promoter driving the expression of the
luciferase gene), as indicated by the name of the cell line.
transfections were performed in six-well plates using the
lipofectamine plus reagent (invitrogen) according to
instructions of the manufacturer. two days after transfection, cells were selected for  xxxg418xxx  (0.4 mg/ml) resistance
and grown for 10 days. cells were seeded into 96-well
plates in a limited dilution of 200 cells per plate. two
weeks later, single colonies were split into three wells and
tested for agonist responsiveness. the clonal cell lines used
exhibited the most robust signal and highest assay-specific
increment and were pharmacologically further characterized. for cho-dukx-sre-luci-d2–17, cho-dukxsre-luci-d4.4–69, and sh-sy5y-sre-luci-d3–121e cells,
receptor plasmids were co-transfected with pcmvsportgalphaqo5-ires-hygro in a ratio of 10:1 receptor plasmids.
co-transfection has been done only with galphai-coupled
receptors. the g-protein galphaq was amplified from human
cerebellar cdna using pfu turbo polymerase and the
upstream primer encoding the c-terminal five amino acids
of the galphaq protein. the resulting pcr product was direc-

stable transfected cho-dukx cells were cultivated in
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem)/f12-mix
(invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-activated fetal
bovine serum (fbs; invitrogen), ht supplement (invitrogen),
0.2 mg/ml hygromycin b (invitrogen), and 0.4 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx 
(invitrogen). cells were grown in a humidified chamber at 37°c
and 5% co2. stable transfected sh-sy5y cells [sh-sy5ysre-luci-d3-121e were cultivated in dmem (invitrogen)]
supplemented with 15% heat-activated fbs, 0.2 mg/ml
hygromycin b, and 0.4 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . cells were grown in a
humidified chamber at 37°c and 8% co2.
 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation assay
cells were detached from the culture dish by treatment with
versene (3–5 min, invitrogen) and seeded in 384-well
microtiter plates (packard optiplate new, packard bioscience, meriden, ct, usa, part no. 6007290) at a density of
approximately 10,000 cells per well in stimulation buffer
[hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) containing 0.5 mm
 xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes), and 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa)] already containing 75 µg/ml anticamp acceptor bead solution. five microliters of stimulation buffer was added to each well prior to the addition of
2.5 µl of agonist. cells were incubated in the dark at room
temperature for 30 min. after incubation, 15 µl biotinylated-camp/streptavidin donor beads detection mix was
added and incubated for 1 to 4 h. plates were read in a
fusion-alpha microplate analyzer. camp formation assays
were performed using the alphascreen camp kit according

to the instructions provided by the supplier (packard
bioscience). data points were run in triplicate and
concentration–response experiments were performed twice.
[35s]gtpgammas binding assay
for the preparation of cell membranes, cells were first
cultured in 176 cm2 petri dishes. at 90% confluency, 5 mm
butyrate was added to increase the receptor expression
level, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h.
the medium was removed and petri dishes were washed
once with 5 ml phosphate-buffered saline(pbs; 1.54 mm
kh2po4, 155.17 mm nacl, 2.71 mm na2hpo4–7h2o),
incubated in 4 ml versene [0.2 g/l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)– xxxd1195xxx  in pbs) for 10 min at room
temperature and detached. cells were pelleted at 460×g and
resuspended in 5 mm tris–hcl buffer (containing 5 mm
edta, 5 mm egta, 0.1 mm phenyl-methylsulphonyl
fluoride and inhibitor cocktail 100 µg/ml  xxxd502xxx , 100 µg/ml
bacitracin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin a; ph 7.6).
cells were homogenized, centrifuged for 15 min at 50,000×g
and resuspended in 5 mm tris–hcl buffer, frozen, and
stored at −80°c in aliquots until used.
for the [35s]gtpgammas binding assay, cell membranes (10–
25 µg) were incubated in a total volume of 200 µl containing
binding buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 100 mm
nacl, and 2–20 µm gdp; ph 7.6) and 0.2 nm [35s]gtpgammas.
following a 60-min incubation period at 30°c in the absence
or presence of various concentrations of agonist, the assay
mixture was rapidly filtered through unifilter® gf/b filters
using a filtermate® filtration device (perkin elmer life
sciences, zaventem, belgium). filters were quickly washed
with 1 ml of 50 mm tris–hcl, 10 mm mgcl2, and 100 mm
nacl at ph 7.6. radioactivity retained on the filters was

determined by liquid scintillation counting. each data point
was performed in triplicate, and each assay was designed to
fit into a single 96-well microtiter plate. concentration
response experiments were repeated two or four times in
order to show reproducibility. non-specific gtpgammas binding
was determined by incubation with a 50,000-fold excess of
cold gtpgammas.
luciferase reporter-gene assays
cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of
approximately 30,000 cells per well in growth medium,
supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin and 0.4 mg/ml
 xxxg418xxx . after 24 h, the medium was replaced by 90 µl medium
without supplements and serum. cells were starved under
these conditions for 15–18 h prior to stimulation by agonist.
subsequently, the corresponding endogenous agonist or
 xxxd3148xxx  (dissolved in pbs containing 1 mg/ml bsa) at the
concentrations indicated at the graphs, was added. the cells
were kept for another 4 h in the incubator at 37°c, the medium
was removed, 20 µl lysis buffer (promega) was applied, and
30 µl of luciferase assay reagent (promega) was added. after
shaking, the luminescence of the solution was measured,
integrative for 3 s with a fluoroskan ascent® fl (labsystems, helsinki, finland). concentration response curves using
 xxxd3148xxx  as agonist or antagonist were performed twice (with
n=3 replicates). when  xxxd3148xxx  behaved as an agonist, a
receptor selective antagonist was used (when available) to
confirm this receptor-dependent activation.
monoamine uptake and release assays
table 2 lists the origins for the synaptosomes used in
the norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-ht uptake/release
assays, reference compounds tested, experimental conditions, and a bibliography documenting the methodology.
scintillation counting was used to detect the quantity of
radioactive tracer ([3h]dopamine, [3h]norepinephrine, or
[3h]5-ht) incorporated into synaptosomes or released
from synaptosomes.

calculations
for radioligand binding and monoamine uptake/release
experiments, ic50 and ec50 values were determined (via
computer software) by nonlinear regression analysis of the
competition curves using hill equation curve fitting. in the
functional assay experiments for all receptors tested, ec50
values were determined by sigmoidal curve fitting using
origin (originlab, northampton, ma, usa).
inhibition constants (ki) were calculated from the cheng–
prusoff equation ðki ¼ ic50 =ð1 þ l=kd þ, where l=concentration of the radioligand in the assay, and kd =affinity of the
radioligand for the receptor.
drugs
 xxxd3148xxx  was provided by schwarz biosciences (monheim, germany). dopamine, r(+)-sch-23390, and l745,870, were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis,
mo, usa). l-741,626 and gr103691 were purchased
from tocris cookson (ballwin, mo, usa).

results
 xxxd3148xxx  binding/affinity assays
using well-established techniques, the ability of  xxxd3148xxx 
to inhibit the binding of typical radioligands (ki) was tested
in detail for 28 receptors, ion channels, and transporter
molecules (table 1). the selection of these 28 cell surface
molecules was based on a previously performed screening
for the potential binding of  xxxd3148xxx  at a fixed concentration of 1 µm with a broader range of 78 different receptors,
channels, and transporters. these receptors were with the

(sites 1 and 2), and cl−. table 3 displays the specific
receptor radioligands which  xxxd3148xxx  effectively (>20% at
1 µm) competed with. the receptor affinity for these
receptors was studied in detail.
binding analysis revealed highest affinity of  xxxd3148xxx  at
dopamine receptors, particularly at the  xxxg657xxx  (ki =
0.71 nm). the overall rank order for the binding affinities of
 xxxd3148xxx  at dopamine receptors was: d3 >>d4.2 ∼d5 ∼d4.7 ∼
d2 ∼d 4.4 >d1. the affinity to the  xxxg657xxx  was 5.5 to 117
times higher than those of the other dopamine receptors.
 xxxd3148xxx  also demonstrated significant, but lower affinities

for alpha-adrenergic receptors (alpha2b, ki =27 nm) and for 5-ht
receptors (5-ht1a and 5-ht7 with ki values of 30 or 86 nm,
respectively), but only minor affinities to 5-ht2 receptors (5ht2b, ki =1,950 nm), which are probably insignificant in
vivo. affinities at muscarinic–acetylcholine and histamine
receptors were low (ki =330–576 nm). the binding studies
have been repeated with the aid of another contract research
organization which confirmed the aforementioned observations (data not shown, but are on file at schwarz biosciences).
 xxxd3148xxx -mediated binding inhibition was also measured at
norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-ht transporters (table 1).
the affinity at dopamine transporters was the highest among
the transporters tested (by 2.7–5.8 times) with ki =826 nm.
its relevance for in vivo effects is also questionable. plasma
levels in humans are in the low nanomolar range (~2.5 nmol/l).

of  xxxd3148xxx  at dopamine receptors

b
 xxxd3148xxx  ec50 value calculated for first phase of the apparent biphasic response. the first phase of the response reaches the maximal response
of dopamine and is assumed to result from activation of a high-affinity site on the dopamine d2l receptor. an ec50 value could not be calculated
for the second phase.

 xxxd3148xxx  on these dopamine receptors, the relative ability
of  xxxd3148xxx  and dopamine to induce production of cyclic
amp was measured in cho cells. for the dopamine d1
receptor,  xxxd3148xxx  was equipotent (ec50 values) to
dopamine, but for the dopamine  xxxg659xxx ,  xxxd3148xxx 
exhibited a fourfold lower potency (table 4). interestingly,
these results are in contrast to radioligand-binding experiments (ki values), where  xxxd3148xxx  was 16-fold more
selective for dopamine d5 over dopamine d1 receptors.
similarly, the reference compound sch23390 has also
shown substantially different profiles in binding experiments versus functional assays. sch23390 was equally
effective for d1 and d5 receptors in binding assays (ki 471
and 418, respectively) but was seven times more potent at
d5 than d1 receptors in functional (luciferase) assays (ec50
38.9 and 277.7 pm, respectively). the maximal response to
 xxxd3148xxx  was similar to the maximal response to dopamine
after activation of either dopamine d1 or d5 receptors
(fig. 2). these results suggest that  xxxd3148xxx  is a full
agonist at dopamine d1 and d5 receptors in this assay.
the d2-like receptors (d2l, d3, and d4.4) are prototypic

and  xxxd1773xxx  production, and activate k+ channels
(missale et al. 1998). to inhibit the production of camp,
stimulation by  xxxd1742xxx  is required. to avoid that requirement, the functional activities of  xxxd3148xxx  and dopamine
were determined in cho and sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells as a function of their ability to induce gdp/[35s]
gtpgammas exchange by receptor-associated  xxxg2224xxx  protein. table 4
lists ec50 values for both agonists at dopamine d2l, d3,
and d4.4 receptors. at all of these receptors,  xxxd3148xxx 
showed a significantly higher functional activity (ec50
values) in comparison to dopamine (3- to 193-fold). based
on gdp/[35s]gtpgammas exchange activity,  xxxd3148xxx  behaved
as a full agonist at d3 receptors and as a partial agonist at
d2l and d4.4 receptors (emax =92.3±9.2%, 68.0±13.9%,
and 48.5±2.1%, respectively, graphs not shown).
in addition to the gtpgammas assay, the intrinsic activity of
 xxxd3148xxx  at dopamine receptor subtypes was also investigated in a more downstream reporter gene assay (luciferase
assay; table 4). in these studies,  xxxd3148xxx  behaved as an
agonist at all tested human dopamine receptor subtypes as
evidenced by concentration-related increases in luciferase
enzyme activity (fig. 3). ec50 values for  xxxd3148xxx  at

fig. 3  xxxd3148xxx - and dopamine-induced luciferase reporter-gene
activity in chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human dopamine
d1, d2l, d3, d4.4, and d5 receptors. cells were stimulated with
increasing concentrations of either dopamine (filled circles) or
 xxxd3148xxx  (filled triangles). concentration response curves using
 xxxd3148xxx  as agonist or antagonist were performed twice (with n=3

replicates). for the d2l response curve, the dotted line depicts the first
phase of activation by  xxxd3148xxx  at an apparent high-affinity d2l
binding site. higher concentrations of  xxxd3148xxx  caused nonspecific
effects (gray symbols), and these data points were not included in the
regression analysis

dopamine d1, d2l, d4.4, and d5 receptors were lower than
those of dopamine (by as much as 53 times); however, at
the  xxxg657xxx , the ec50 value for  xxxd3148xxx  was almost
2,600-fold less than that of dopamine (table 4).
in luciferase-reporter assays for the d1 and d5 receptors,
 xxxd3148xxx  behaved as a full agonist, eliciting a similar maximal response to that of dopamine (fig. 3a,e). however, with
the dopamine d2l receptor luciferase assays, the maximal
activation by  xxxd3148xxx  was higher (‘supramaximal’) than by
dopamine and the concentration–response curve seemed to be
biphasic (fig. 3b). an artificial mathematical approximation
suggests an ec50 of 0.36 nm for the first phase of the
biphasic response curve—a value closer to that at the
 xxxg657xxx  (table 4, fig. 2b)—and a much higher
ec50 value for the second phase of activation, which
however, could not be calculated. based on that approximation, the affinity of  xxxd3148xxx  for this apparent high-affinity
site on the d2l receptor was greater than its affinity for dopamine d1, d5, or d4.4 receptors (2.6 to 11.4 times). while
considering ec50 values including a calculated value for the
high-affinity d2l site, the rank order of potency for  xxxd3148xxx 
at dopamine receptors is d3 >d2l >d1 =d5 >d4.4. the maximal
activation by  xxxd3148xxx  at the dopamine d3 and d4.4 receptors

was slightly (≈10%) less than that of dopamine (fig. 3c,d), but
it may be considered a full agonist at these receptors in this
assay.
with each of the five dopamine receptor constructs,
 xxxd3148xxx -induced (10 nm) luciferase activity was inhibited
by specific antagonists (1 µm) of the respective receptor
subtypes, demonstrating the binding and activation by
 xxxd3148xxx . the inhibition of the reporter gene response for
d1 and d5 (antagonist r(+)-sch-23390) was 65% and
87%, respectively.
d2-like receptors d2l, d3, d4.4 (antagonists l-741,626;
gr103691; l-745,870) responses were inhibited by 79%,
58%, and 86%, respectively. as described, the inhibition of
the  xxxd3148xxx -induced receptor activation by the antagonists
was not complete. this is in accordance with investigations
with the natural agonist dopamine. partial antagonism
(similar to inhibition of percent) could be demonstrated for
the natural agonist dopamine except at the d2l receptor,
where l-741,626 was a full antagonist (data not shown). it
might be possible that the antagonist concentrations were not
sufficient, or the antagonists may not be full antagonists.
obviously, the different functional assays yielded different
results which may be due to the methods and assay specifics.

intrinsic activity of  xxxd3148xxx  at non-dopaminergic
receptors
in radioligand binding studies,  xxxd3148xxx  displayed moderate affinity for only a few, but potentially important nondopamine receptors (adrenergic and serotonergic receptors).
therefore,  xxxd3148xxx  was further tested in luciferasereporter assays to determine the functional interaction with
these receptors compared to their natural ligands. agonistic
effects (ec50 and emax) for  xxxd3148xxx  and control ligands
are listed in table 5. regarding functional activity,
 xxxd3148xxx  displayed the highest potency (ec50 values) at
alpha1a-adrenergic receptors where it was identified as a partial
agonist (emax =45%). this partial agonistic activity of
 xxxd3148xxx  could be completely blocked by the selective
alpha-1 antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (data not shown).
for the  xxxg1108xxx , the ec50 value was found to be
1,040 nm. after extrapolation, the emax at that receptor was
90±6%. minor agonistic activations were also seen at alpha2aadrenergic, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (table 5).
activity of  xxxd3148xxx  at 5-ht1a, alpha1a-adrenergic, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors was abrogated in a concentration-dependent
way by the specific antagonists way100635, yohimbine,
and methiothepin. these investigations determined that the
rank order for the agonistic activities of  xxxd3148xxx  (consid-

ering ec50 and emax  xxxd1891xxx  µm) at these receptors was alpha1aadrenergic>5-ht1a >ht1b = xxxg1110xxx .
possible antagonistic activities of  xxxd3148xxx  at nondopamine receptors were determined by evaluating its
ic50 values (on reporter-gene activity induced by the
natural ligand) at each receptor as listed in table 5. based
on ic50 value and percent inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  mum, we
demonstrated that  xxxd3148xxx  inhibited the activity of the
natural ligands of alpha2b- and alpha2c-adrenergic receptors at ic50
concentrations of ≈500 nm. inhibition of reporter-gene
activity also occurred at alpha1a-, and m2 receptors (ic50
concentrations of ≈700 nm) and alpha1b-, m1, and h1 receptors
(ic50 concentrations of >2,000 nm; table 5).
these results correlated fairly well with the results of
radioligand binding experiments:  xxxd3148xxx  had the highest
affinity for alpha2b-, and alpha2c-adrenergic receptors, with lesser
affinity demonstrated for the others (alpha1a >alpha1b =h1 >m2).
due to the binding and functional activation of
monoamine receptors by  xxxd3148xxx , its effects on monoamine uptake and release in synaptosomes were also
measured.  xxxd3148xxx  inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled
monoamines up to different degrees (norepinephrine
ic50 =48 nm, dopamine ic50 =160 nm, and 5-ht ic50 =
710 nm, data not shown).  xxxd3148xxx  had little effect on
monoamine release from synaptosomes with an ec50 of

82

6,000 nm for dopamine and 15,000 nm for 5-ht. the ec50
could not be determined for norepinephrine as it was above
the highest  xxxd3148xxx  concentration tested (30 µm; data not
shown).

discussion
the present study was undertaken to characterize the
receptor profile of  xxxd3148xxx  using a broad spectrum of
receptors. as has recently been shown (millan et al. 2002),
the clinically used dopamine agonists for the treatment of
pd do not only interact with d2 and d3 receptors (although
they might previously have been characterized as such) but
also with other receptors (with different affinities). therefore, it was of importance to determine the receptor profile
of  xxxd3148xxx  in detail as the interaction with the various
receptors may play a role not only concerning the motor
effects in pd but also regarding disease progression,
propensity to induce dyskinesia or potential other effects.
it was found that  xxxd3148xxx  acts as an agonist for all
dopamine receptors with a moderate selectivity for the d2like subtypes, particularly the  xxxg657xxx .  xxxd3148xxx  also
was found to bind solely to the  xxxg1108xxx  and the alpha2b receptor
subtypes as non-dopamine receptors when taking into
account the clinically relevant plasma concentrations. the
interaction with these receptors may be considered as
potentially relevant for its activity as anti-parkinsonian
agent.
to determine its functional activity, different assays
based on different technologies were used. a camp assay
was used to determine the intrinsic activity of  xxxd3148xxx 
with respect to the d1 and d5 receptors which per se
stimulate the production of camp and thus allow for a
precise measurement. the [35s]gtpgammas assay was used with
respect to the d2-like receptors which pre se inhibit the
production of camp and thus cause a decline of intracellular camp levels; the decline of camp cannot be directly
measured without stimulation of camp production by
 xxxd1742xxx  which was to be omitted. in addition, a luciferase
reporter gene assay was used which allowed for a direct
comparison of the responses via the different dopamine
(and non-dopamine) receptors. however, although the readout is more downstream of the intracellular signaling
cascade when compared to the camp or the 35s]gtpgammas
assay, the validity of the results should be confirmed by
using these assays. in addition, the luciferase reporter gene
assay has a high sensitivity and has the advantage that the
responses of gi coupled d2-like receptors could be measured
without the use of  xxxd1742xxx  by the sre-based reporter gene
assay (george et al. 1998; fan et al. 2005; al-fulaij et al.
2007; jiang et al. 2005). this should help to primarily
identify and confirm the intrinsic activity of  xxxd3148xxx ; it was

naunyn-schmiedeberg’s arch pharmacol (2009) 379:73–86

not intended to compare potencies or efficacies in the various
assays and among the investigated receptors, which were to
be expected to be different when using different methods
(vanhauwe et al. 1999). indeed, some of the discrepancies in
receptor signaling are attributable to the different assay
conditions (temperature, buffer composition, membrane
binding compared to cellular assay). however, the results
were considered to be more conclusive than previous
investigations which used membrane fractions of calf
caudate nuclei (van der weide et al. 1987, 1988) or rat or
mouse vas deferens (friedman et al. 1992; martin et al.
1993), which required more complex pharmacological
procedures and were difficult to interpret due to the
complexity of the organ incubations (see the efforts of
(friedman et al. 1992; martin et al. 1993). in addition, only
d2 and d1 receptors were known at that time, and thus,
 xxxd3148xxx  could only be characterized regarding potential
interaction with d2 or d1 dopamine receptors. in fact, the
previous observations regarding the agonism of  xxxd3148xxx  on
d1 and d2 receptors were confirmed by our investigations
thus validating our approach.
the data obtained here show that  xxxd3148xxx  is a potent
agonist at the dopamine receptors with ki values in the
nanomolar or even subnanomolar (for the  xxxg657xxx )
range. in functional terms,  xxxd3148xxx  was about 2,600 times
more potent than dopamine at the  xxxg657xxx , whereas it
was more or less equally potent as dopamine at the other
dopamine receptor subtypes. thus, at therapeutic concentrations (~0.8 ng/ml or ~2.5 nm plasma concentration),
 xxxd3148xxx  is to be expected to activate all five of these
dopamine receptors (poewe and leussi 2005). however, it
is theoretically possible that  xxxd3148xxx  may stabilize a
distinct conformational state of the dopaminergic gpcr or
may regulate signals via different g proteins that are
coupled to the dopamine gcprs “agonist-directed trafficking” in comparison to dopamine, thus acting as a “protean”
agonist (lane et al. 2007).
the utility of  xxxg656xxx  activation in pd is well
established. most dopamine agonists with proven efficacy
in parkinson’s bind to the d2-like subtypes as opposed to
the d1-likes (millan et al. 2002). the d2 receptors not only
are highly expressed in the striatum (missale et al. 1998),
but are also supersensitive in pd (pd; rinne et al. 1993)
and models of pd (doudet et al. 2000). however, there is
growing evidence for an important modulatory role of the
dopamine d3 receptors (joyce 2001). in fact, the binding
affinities of antiparkinsonian agents in clinical use are
similar or even higher at d3 than at the d2 receptors
(gerlach et al. 2003; piercey 1998; millan et al. 2002).
although d3 receptors are sparse relative to d2 in the
caudate–putamen, the ventral striatum is densely populated
with d3 receptors (joyce 2001) having a modulatory role
on the motor output as well as on the affective state.

naunyn-schmiedeberg’s arch pharmacol (2009) 379:73–86

evidence suggests that in pd, the  xxxg656xxx  number is
enhanced, whereas the  xxxg657xxx  density is decreased in
the ventral striatum, particularly in later stages of the
disease (joyce 2001). thus, not only d2, but also d3
receptor agonism may be of importance for the effective
treatment of both motor and mood disturbances in pd.
additionally, recent data have suggested that d3-preferring
dopamine agonists have neuroprotective effects (joyce and
millan 2007; carvey et al. 2001; hall et al. 1996).
of the dopamine-receptor subtypes, the  xxxg655xxx  is the
most widely distributed in the central nervous system and,
like the  xxxg656xxx , highly expressed in the striatum
(missale et al. 1998). although agonists that selectively
activate the  xxxg655xxx  have not been developed for clinical
use, activation of d1 receptors has been shown to provide
marked antiparkinsonian activity (taylor et al. 1991).
however, no d1 agonist is currently being marketed. the
reasons could be the limited bioavailability of the compounds synthesized to date (potentially due to the catechol
moiety), the development of tolerance, and the risk of
inducing epilepsy (mailman et al. 2001; corvol et al. 2006).
it is generally agreed that selective d2 agonists are far
less efficacious in the treatment of the parkinsonian
symptoms in humans than levodopa. a simple explanation
could be that the d1 receptors play a crucial role
(loschmann et al. 1992; giardina and williams 2001;
mailman et al. 2001; mailman and nichols 1998; williams
et al. 1997). importantly, rascol et al. (2001b, 1999)
showed that abt-431 (a full d1 agonist similar to
dihydrexidine; see giardina and williams 2001) was equieffective to levodopa, the only d1 agonist to ever show
effectiveness in humans. together, this suggests an important role for d1 receptors in the effective treatment of pd.
in fact, the simultaneous activation of dopamine d1 and d2
receptors is known to produce greater locomotor stimulation than d2 activation alone (clark and white 1987).
 xxxd3148xxx  indeed shows affinity to the  xxxg655xxx  which
might contribute to its efficacy (loschmann et al. 1992),
although it is far less than to the d2 and d3 receptors. in
contrast to that,  xxxd3145xxx  or pramipexole do not show d1
activity (gerlach et al. 2003; millan et al. 2002), which
might explain weaker activity in experimental models
(loschmann et al. 1992).
the possible role of d4 or  xxxg659xxx  activation in pd
has not been established. although most antiparkinsonian
drugs have significant binding affinities at d4 receptors
(millan et al. 2002), the range of affinity/efficacy seen for
this receptor varies widely and its activation does not
appear to impact clinical efficacy (newman-tancredi et al.
1997). this may be due to very low levels of expression of
dopamine d4 receptors in the striatum (missale et al. 1998).
although dopamine d5 receptors are more abundant in
striatum (missale et al. 1998), the binding affinities of anti-

83

parkinsonian agents at these receptors is generally low or
even negligible (pki <5 for pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx ;
millan et al. 2002), explaining perhaps why the role of d5
receptor activation by anti-parkinson drugs has not been
taken into consideration so far. interestingly, dopamine d5
receptors are highly expressed in hippocampus where they
may mediate learning and memory (missale et al. 1998).
in summary and regarding the actual knowledge available,  xxxd3148xxx  may be considered as a dopamine agonist
eliciting its efficacy in pd via d3/d2/d1 receptors.
although activation of dopamine receptors is considered
a prerequisite for antiparkinsonian action, other monoaminergic receptors may play a role in the efficacy and sideeffect profiles of agents used to treat pd (millan et al.
2002). the activity of  xxxd3148xxx  at alpha2b-adrenergic and  xxxg1108xxx  receptors may be considered as of importance.
experimental studies have shown that the  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic
antagonists idazoxan, rauwolscine, and yohimbine were
active, e.g., reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesia in rat
(henry et al. 1999) or exhibiting neuroprotective properties
(srinivasan and schmidt 2004). idazoxan also was found to
be active in monkeys (grondin et al. 2000). clinical
studies, however, remain contradictory (rascol et al.
2001a; manson et al. 2000). the  xxxg1108xxx  is known
to modulate dopaminergic activity and motor function in
the basal ganglia and can reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia without reducing, and potentially increasing, the
therapeutic effects of levodopa (nicholson and brotchie
2002; carta et al. 2007). in a monkey model of pd, the
selective 5-ht1a agonist sarizotan reduced levodopainduced dyskinesia by more than 90% (bibbiani et al.
2001). in patients with advanced pd, concomitant sarizotan
and levodopa therapy was shown to reduce dyskinesias and
prolong antiparkinsonian action (bara-jimenez et al. 2005).
furthermore, 5-ht1a agonists also have been shown to
inhibit excitotoxic mechanisms and thus impart neuroprotection in vitro (madhavan et al. 2003) and in vivo
(mauler and horvath 2005). the  xxxg1108xxx  also is
supposed to mediate antidepressant activity (blier and
abbott 2001). thus, although these observations suggest a
beneficial role of the alpha2b and  xxxg1108xxx , detailed
investigations regarding the potential interactions of  xxxd3148xxx  with these receptors have not been performed. it is
noteworthy that  xxxd3148xxx  lacks affinity for the 5-ht2b
receptor, which is involved in valvular diseases (setola et
al. 2003; launay et al. 2002; zanettini et al. 2007).
in summary,  xxxd3148xxx  is a non-ergolinic dopamine d3/
d2/d1 dopamine receptor agonist with therapeutic potency
in pd; its potential interaction with d4/d5 receptors needs
further evaluation in that respect. although  xxxd3148xxx 
shows specificity for the dopaminergic system, it also
exhibits a characteristic interaction with 5-ht1a and alpha2b
receptors which might contribute to its efficacy especially

84

with respect to dyskinesia or disease progression but also
needs further investigations.
