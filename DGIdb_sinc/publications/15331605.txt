an afa operon (5) that expresses the afa/dr adhesion complex
on the surface of the bacteria.
although originally thought to be afimbrial, the afa/dr adhesins have been shown to form extended fimbrial structures
on the surface of bacteria (5–9). these structures are made up
of the e protein, which acts as both the adhesin and the major
structural subunit (10, 11), and the d protein, which caps the
structure and acts as the invasin (12). they mediate location of
bacteria to the gut or urinary tract via adhesion to the mammalian complement regulatory protein, the decay accelerating
factor (daf1 or  xxxg394xxx ). daf is a 70-kda protein found on the
apical surface of host epithelial cells and attaches to the cell
surface via a glycophosphotidylinositol anchor (13–15). the
afa/dr adhesins have also been shown to bind to members of
the  xxxg427xxx  family, although the significance
of this is yet to be determined (16, 17).
the afa/dr adhesins comprise afae-i to afae-viii, f1845,
drae, and entropathogenic e. coli afa (9). although these
adhesins differ in sequence, they all bind to the third ccp
domain of daf with the exception of afae-vii and afae-viii
(18). two of the afa/dr adhesins, afae-iii and drae, differ in
sequence by only three amino acids but possess significantly
different properties. for example, drae has been reported to
bind to the 7s domain of type iv collagen (19), but afae-iii does
not. the binding of drae to both daf and type iv collagen is
blocked by the presence of chloramphenicol (20 –22), whereas
the binding of afae-iii to daf is unaffected.
recent structures (11) for an engineered form of the afae-iii
adhesin (afae-dsc) have allowed an atomic understanding of
its assembly into fimbrae and have also allowed mapping of the
sites of  xxxg394xxx  interaction onto the adhesin. dr family fimbrial
assembly is seen to proceed in the same way as bacterial pili
assembly (11). briefly, adhesin subunits are found to consist of
an immunoglobulin-like fold that misses a central antiparallel
␤-strand and also possess an n-terminal extension. in the
bacterial periplasm the missing strand is provided by a
periplasmic chaperone in a process termed donor strand
complementation that aids folding and also targets the adhesin
subunits to the outer membrane usher protein for export (23–
28). assembly into fimbrae on the bacterial surface proceeds
via the free n-terminal strand that allows attachment to another adhesin subunit by taking over the role previously performed by the chaperone in an anti-parallel arrangement, a

pathogenic escherichia coli expressing afa/dr adhesins are able to cause both urinary tract and diarrheal
infections. the afa/dr adhesins confer adherence to epithelial cells via interactions with the human complement regulating protein, decay accelerating factor (daf
or  xxxg394xxx ). two of the afa/dr adhesions, afae-iii and
drae, differ from each other by only three residues but
are reported to have several different properties. one
such difference is disruption of the interaction between
drae and  xxxg394xxx  by chloramphenicol, whereas binding of
afae-iii to  xxxg394xxx  is unaffected. here we present a crystal
structure of a strand-swapped trimer of wild type drae.
we also present a crystal structure of this trimer in
complex with chloramphenicol, as well as nmr data
supporting the binding position of chloramphenicol
within the crystal. the crystal structure reveals the precise atomic basis for the sensitivity of drae- xxxg394xxx  binding to chloramphenicol and demonstrates that in contrast to other chloramphenicol-protein complexes, drug
binding is mediated via recognition of the chlorine “tail”
rather than via intercalation of the benzene rings into a
hydrophobic pocket.

process termed donor strand exchange (24, 27–29). chemical
shift mapping was used to map  xxxg394xxx  binding and localized it to
one face of the structure (11). the engineered afae-dsc used for
these structural studies (11, 30) is maintained in a monomeric
state by relocation of the n-terminal extension to the c terminus where it is able to fold back and provide the missing strand
within the ig fold, a process termed self-complementation.
this paper presents x-ray structures for native drae and
afae-iii in isolation and also of a drae-chloramphenicol complex and seeks to understand the basis for the differential
receptor and inhibitor binding exhibited by the two proteins.
these structures reveal a novel mode of chloramphenicol binding that provides potential for the design of a new class of
anti-bacterial agents.
experimental procedures

cloning, expression, and purification of afae-dsc, native drae, native afae-iii, and  xxxg394xxx —native afae-iii and drae (strain o75) were
expressed separately as n-terminal hexahistidine fusions in e. coli
strain m15 (qiagen) as described previously (11). briefly, the adhesins
were purified from the supernatant using nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography in an s75-sepharose
column (amersham biosciences) to separate the trimeric forms from
small amounts of monomeric, dimeric, and aggregated forms of the
adhesins.  xxxg394xxx  was purified and refolded from e. coli also as described
previously (31). afae-dsc, drae-dsc, and the mutants of the two were
expressed from prseta plasmid in bl21(de3) cells. they were purified via an n-terminal hexahistidine tag using nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid superflow resin (qiagen) as described previously for afae-dsc
(11, 30).
chloramphenicol sensitivity assayed using surface plasmon resonance—native afae-iii and drae were covalently coupled to the carboxylated dextran matrix on the surface on an activated cm5 sensor

chip using the primary amine coupling kit (biacore ab). after activation according to the standard protocol, 0.5 mg/ml of drae or afae-iii
in 10 mm sodium acetate (ph 4.5) was injected. differing levels were
immobilized (⬃8,000 resonance units of afae-iii and ⬃3,500 of drae)
by varying the volume of protein injected. all interaction sensorgrams
were collected at 20 °c by flowing 80 ␮l (at 20 ␮l/min) of a  xxxg394xxx /
chloramphenicol (cm) mixture where the  xxxg394xxx  concentration was 1
␮m, and the cm concentration varied between 0 and 3.8 mm. measurements were taken as triplets where the first injection was of  xxxg394xxx  with
no cm added, the second contained cm at the specified concentration,
and the third contained cm only. the maximum response obtained was
corrected for bulk effects (using data from a mock coupled channel
where no afae-iii or drae were coupled) and nonspecific chloramphenicol binding (using the signal from the cm-only injections). data were
plotted by taking the maximum response obtained with and without
cm and reporting the signal as a percentage of that obtained without
drug. data presented are the mean and standard deviations of three
independent repeats.
crystallization and structure determination—crystals of afae-iii
and drae were grown at 21 °c using sitting drop vapor diffusion.
afae-iii was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml, whereas drae was concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml. afae-iii-se-met crystals (i432) grew against a
reservoir solution containing 2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene
glycol 400, and 0.1 m sodium hepes (ph 6.8 –7.0). native afae-iii
crystals (p3121) grew against a reservoir of 0.2 m  xxxd2534xxx ,
20 –21%  xxxd2982xxx  4000, and 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.8). drae
crystals (p212121) were obtained against a reservoir solution of 2 m
ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7). co-crystals of the drae-cm
complex (p3) grew against a reservoir of 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 100
␮m cm (as reported in biological assays (22)) or 2.8 mm cm and 0.1 m
nahepes (ph 7). all crystals were flash frozen in nitrogen gas, and
data were collected at 100 k with crystals in a fiber loop. data were
collected in-house, at the european synchrotron radiation facility
(bm-14), grenoble, france, and at the synchrotron radiation source
(stations 9.6 and 14.2), daresbury, united kingdom.

results and discussion

x-ray structures for oligomeric forms of afae-iii and
drae—whereas earlier structural work (11) used a form of
afae-iii engineered to be monomeric (afae-dsc), heterologous
expression of native afae-iii and drae sequences in e. coli
lacking the dr fimbrial assembly machinery leads to the production of oligomeric forms of the adhesins. these oligomers
have been extensively studied (e.g. refs. 12, 35, and 36) and
have been seen to possess the biological functions of the assembled adhesins (e.g. ability to bind host cell receptors, inhibition
profiles, antigenic properties) with the exception that they do
not assemble to form fimbrae. therefore we sought to determine the structures of these oligomeric forms to facilitate comparisons with the structure of afae-dsc and interpretation of
existing biological data. size exclusion chromatography (11)
has previously shown that the majority of the soluble oligomers
are likely to be trimers and once purified, trimeric oligomers of
afae-iii and drae readily produced crystals suitable for structure determination. the structure of an afae-iii trimer was
solved at a resolution of 3.3 å using multiple anomalous dispersion methods and a  xxxd3187xxx -labeled form of afaeiii (table i, fig. 1a, and “experimental procedures”). the
structure of drae was then solved using this model as a starting model for phasing by molecular replacement. in all three
differently packed crystal forms have been obtained (two afaeiii forms and a single drae form), with the exception of the
naturally differing side chains derived from the sequence differences, afae-iii and drae possess identical structures (fig.
1b); the structures superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.6 å over all backbone atoms. moreover, structural
comparison reveals a close superimposition between the aver2

despite possessing an identical fold to monomeric afae-dsc,
the trimer (fig. 1a) consists of intermolecular disulfide bonded
monomers in which the n-terminal donor strand is folded back
to form an intramolecular, anti-parallel ␤-strand g. this is

the afae-iii-se-met structure (protein data bank accession number
1usz) was solved at 3.1 å by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion
with the suite of programs autosharp (32) and built and refined (as all
the other structures in this paper) with the program xtalview (33) and
buster-tnt (41). the se-met model was used to solve the afae-iii
native crystal structure by molecular replacement with the program
molrep (34) (3.3 å resolution, protein data bank accession number
1ut2). the native drae structure (1.7 å resolution, protein data bank
accession number 1ut1) was also solved with molrep using protein
data bank accession number 1usz as a search model. finally, the
drae-cm complex (1.9 å resolution, protein data bank accession number 1usq) was again solved by molecular replacement with molrep
using the coordinates of the native drae as the search model. for the
drae-cm complex, rebuilding and refinement proceeded with the simple addition of water and remodeling of protein side chains until no
difference density could be identified in the fo ⫺ fc map other than that
associated with the cm, at which point the model for the cm molecule
was built.
chemical shift mapping—15n-labeled nmr samples of afae-dsc,
drae-dsc, and mutants were prepared to a final concentration of 1 mm
and a volume of 500 ␮l in 50 mm acetate buffer (ph 5.0), 100 mm sodium
chloride, and 10% d2o. samples were quantified using uv absorbance
at 280 nm wavelength. chloramphenicol was prepared up to a concentration of 7 mm in the same buffer as the protein and solubilized by mild
heating. chloramphenicol was added to each sample in increments
described in the text. all experiments were carried out on a 500 mhz
four-channel bruker drx500 spectrometer equipped with a z-shielded
gradient triple resonance cryoprobe.
coordinates and figure preparation—coordinates and x-ray crystallographic data for the structures have been deposited at the protein
data bank under the accession codes 1usq, 1usz, 1ut1 and 1ut2.

chloramphenicol binding by drae
suggest that the thr88met mutation may also play an important role in the lack of cm binding to afae-iii.
to provide additional evidence for the observations seen in
the crystal structure of the drae-cm complex, we performed an
nmr chemical shift mapping experiment on monomeric draedsc in the presence of increasing concentrations of cm. a number of heteronuclear single quantum coherence peaks shift
upon titration with cm, which is consistent with a weak but
specific interaction between cm and drae (fig. 2c). based on
changes in 15n against 1h ppm, significant peak shifts were
grouped into large, medium, and small. the largest chemical
shift changes were seen in amide peaks corresponding to residues tyr-115 and ile-114, both of which are implicated by our
crystal structure to be crucial for the drae-cm interaction.
furthermore, the medium and small peak shifts map to the
region of the drae-cm interface (fig. 2, d and e). these observations were further probed with surface plasmon resonance
experiments to examine  xxxg394xxx  binding by the adhesins in the
presence of cm (fig. 3c). these studies confirm earlier reports
in that  xxxg394xxx  binding by drae is seen to be cm sensitive with
⬃50% inhibition seen to occur with 2.8 mm cm, whereas afaeiii binding to  xxxg394xxx  is not significantly altered by cm at this
concentration. these results confirm that the subtle alterations
seen between the afae-iii and drae are indeed sufficient to
ablate cm sensitivity.
the structure of the drae-cm complex may provide the start
point for the design of novel antimicrobial compounds because,
in contrast to earlier structures for cm-ligand complexes (37,
40) where binding of cm involves burial of the benzene ring,
the interactions seen here are focused on burial of the chlorines. this observation may allow design of novel therapeutics
that maintain the geometry of the adhesin-cm interaction
without the nitro-benzene ring and hence avoid the toxic side
effects associated with therapeutic use of cm caused by intercalation into the human ribosome. because the lack of sensitivity to cm of the afae-iii is seen to be dependent on covering
of the cm site by a single side chain we speculate that agents
designed to bind with higher affinity would be able to displace
this side chain and so achieve more wide ranging action against
this whole class of bacterial adhesins.

in a neighboring subunit (fig. 1, a and c). we believe this to be
an artifactual domain swapping that occurs as a result of
cytoplasmic expression in the absence of the chaperone and
illustrates the potential problems that can occur in unassisted
assembly of fimbrae/pilins. it also represents one of only a few
observations describing cyclic domain-swapped trimers (38, 39)
and reflects the inherent conformational malleability of these
domains. non-reducing sds-page (fig. 1d) confirms this conclusion as analysis of adhesive organelles purified from the
surface of dr⫹ bacteria could not detect the existence of a
disulfide bonded polymer. despite this misfolding, the atomic
structures of the trimeric adhesins differ from the correctly
folded form at only five residues (those in the a1-a2 linker)
because for the majority of the residues it is simply which
subunit they originate from that differs rather than their location within the protein fold being changed. therefore it is not
surprising that earlier biological analyses using oligomeric adhesins found them to be biologically active (12, 35, 36).
x-ray structure of a drae-chloramphenicol complex—the
high degree of structural similarity between afae-iii and drae
does not facilitate an understanding of their subtly different
biology; in particular, the precise structural basis of the differential susceptibility to inhibition of  xxxg394xxx -binding by cm (22).
therefore we decided to determine the structure of a drae-cm
complex. high resolution data for the drae-cm complex (1.9 å,
table i) were collected from co-crystals grown in the presence
of 2.8 mm cm (see “experimental procedures”). these crystals
were in space group p3 and were phased by molecular replacement with the drae coordinates described above (see “experimental procedures”). calculation of unbiased fo ⫺ fc difference fourier maps prior to construction of a model for the
bound cm (fig. 2a) allowed unambiguous positioning of the
drug, and the coordinates for the complex were subject to
further rounds of refinement to yield the model described in
table i (fig. 2). other data sets collected from crystals that
were grown in the absence of cm and then soaked in cm at a
range of concentrations (down to 0.1 mm) prior to data collection showed cm to be bound in identical fashion (data not
shown). the drae-cm complex structure reveals that cm
binds in a surface pocket between the n-terminal portion of
strand b and the c-terminal portion of strand e and lies within
the  xxxg394xxx -binding site identified by chemical shift mapping
(11). cm is anchored at one end by van der waals contacts of its
chcl2 moiety with the methylene groups of gly-113 and
gly-42 and pro-40 and pro-43 residues and at the other end by
stacking of the p-nitro group against the side chain of ile111
(fig. 2). the ring of tyr-115 closes the bottom of this hydrophobic pocket with contacts to the chlorine atoms and additional contacts to the c-␣ atoms of ile-114. binding of cm in
this site clearly suggests that the cm sensitivity of drae is
caused by a direct disruption of the  xxxg394xxx -binding surface of
drae because the cm masks a portion of the drae surface
previously shown to be involved in binding of  xxxg394xxx  (11).
this cm binding site is seen to be in close proximity to two of
the three sequence differences between afae-iii and drae
(fig. 3a) and may therefore provide an explanation for the
reported lack of activity for cm against afae-iii binding of
 xxxg394xxx . in the crystal structure of afae-iii, the thr88met mutation puts the side chain of met-88 into the hydrophobic
pocket occupied by cm in drae (fig. 3b), and the ile111thr
mutation replaces the ile, which packs against the p-nitro
group and neighboring residues crucial for cm recognition.
these structural differences seem sufficient to produce the
reported lack of cm sensitivity for afae-iii. carnoy and moseley (22) have demonstrated previously that the single
ile111thr mutant completely abolishes cm binding. our data
