severe congenital neutropenia (scn) is
an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. like
most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked
propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to mds/leukemia that exceeds 20%.
the genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes
that contribute to malignant transformation in scn are largely unknown. in this
study, we performed mutational profiling
of 14 genes previously implicated in leu-

kemogenesis using 14 mds/leukemia
samples from patients with scn. we used
high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome–amplified genomic
dna with a semiautomated method to
detect mutations. the sensitivity and
specificity of the sequencing pipeline was
validated by determining the frequency of
mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de
novo aml samples. as expected, mutations of  xxxg2198xxx  genes ( xxxg801xxx , kit,
and jak2) were common in de novo aml,
with a cumulative frequency of 30%. in

contrast, no mutations in these genes
were detected in the scn samples; instead, mutations of  xxxg529xxx , encoding the
 xxxg529xxx , were common. these
data support the hypothesis that mutations of  xxxg529xxx  may provide the “activated  xxxg2198xxx  signal” that is
thought to be important for leukemogenesis. (blood. 2007;110:1648-1655)

introduction
bone marrow failure syndromes are characterized by a deficiency
of 1 or more hematopoietic lineage. a common feature of both
congenital and acquired forms of bone marrow failure is a marked
propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (aml) or a
myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). the cumulative risk of developing aml or mds in patients with chronic bone marrow failure
ranges from 2% to greater than 20%.1-7 distinct genetic changes are
associated with aml arising in the setting of bone marrow failure.
the most prevalent genetic changes are abnormalities of chromosome 7; while only 5% of de novo aml samples display a loss of
some or all of chromosome 7, they are present in 35% to 68% of
aml arising in the setting of bone marrow failure.3,8-14 these data
suggest that distinct genetic mechanisms mediate leukemogenesis
in patients with bone marrow failure syndromes.
severe congenital neutropenia (scn) is a congenital bone
marrow failure syndrome characterized by severe neutropenia
present from birth, an arrest of myeloid differentiation at the
promyelocyte/myelocyte stage, and frequent infections.15,16 treatment with granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  (g-csf) is effective in increasing neutrophil counts in most patients.4,17 like other

bone marrow failure syndromes, scn is associated with a marked
propensity to develop mds or aml. the french neutropenia
registry reported a cumulative incidence of mds or aml in
patients with scn of 10.8% at 20 years of age.18 a recent update of
the severe chronic neutropenia international registry (scnir)
showed that the cumulative incidence of mds or aml was 21%
after 10 years of g-csf therapy.4 moreover, no plateau in the
incidence of aml or mds was observed, suggesting that the
cumulative risk of progression may be even higher.
the molecular mechanisms that mediate leukemic transformation in scn are poorly understood. transformation has been
associated with acquired clonal cytogenetic changes, most
commonly involving the partial or complete loss of chromosome
7, activating ras mutations, or abnormalities of chromosome
21.3,10 in addition, acquired mutations of the  xxxg529xxx  gene
encoding the  xxxg529xxx  (g- xxxg525xxx ) are present in a subset
of patients with scn and are strongly associated with the
development of aml or mds.19-23 however, the contribution of
these  xxxg529xxx  mutations to leukemogenesis remains unclear,
since transgenic mice expressing mutant g- xxxg525xxx  do not

develop aml or mds,24,25 despite displaying a hyperproliferative response to g-csf.
in the present study, the frequency of mutations in 14 genes
previously implicated in the pathogenesis of aml was determined
in 14 scn patients who had transformed to mds or acute
leukemia. a high-throughput sequencing pipeline was established
using exon-based resequencing of whole-genome–amplified
genomic dna (since sample abundance was extremely low for
these samples) and a semiautomated method to detect mutations.
the sensitivity and specificity of the resequencing pipeline was
validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these
14 genes in 188 de novo aml samples. as expected,  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1584xxx ,
and cebpa were the most frequently mutated genes in the de novo
aml samples, but no mutations in these genes were detected in the
scn samples. the pattern of gene mutations in scn-mds/aml
has implications both for the design of targeted therapies and for
our understanding of the mechanisms of leukemic transformation
in scn patients.

patients, materials, and methods
human subjects
ninety-four adult patients with de novo aml (discovery set) were enrolled
in a study at washington university to identify genetic factors contributing
to leukemia initiation and progression. approval was obtained from the
washington university institutional review board for these studies. informed consent was obtained in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki. eligibility criteria included age greater than 18, more than 30%
myeloblasts in the bone marrow, and the absence of antecedent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or history of myelodysplasia. samples with 2 or
fewer clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were given preference for inclusion
in the study. peripheral blood and bone marrow were obtained for analysis
of tumor cells, and a 6-mm punch biopsy of skin was obtained for analysis
of unaffected somatic cells. dna was prepared from both tissues using
standard protocols. ninety-four de novo aml samples from patients with
the same entry criteria were also obtained from cancer and leukemia
group b (calgb); similar numbers of patients with the m0/1, m2, m3,
and m4 french-american-british (fab) subtype were selected for analysis.26 the scn bone marrow samples were obtained from the scnir and
french neutropenia registry. the institutional review boards of all
participating institutions approved this study.
sequencing
due to the limited amounts of starting material available for many
samples, phi29-based whole-genome amplification was performed on
genomic dna samples (both scn and de novo aml samples) using the
qiagen repli-g service (qiagen, valencia, ca).27 gene sequences were
extracted from 2 public draft human genome databases, genbank28 and
ensembl,29 and used as reference sequences for assembly and primer
construction. the 500-bp 5⬘ flanking region and exonic regions,
including the exon/intron boundaries, were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) to generate amplicons for resequencing. universal
tails were added to the 5⬘ ends of amplification primers to serve as the
sequencing primer sites. the primers were either designed by abi
variantseqr (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/probe/doc/projvariantseqr.shtml) or with scripts that are based on the use of the
primer 3 program version 1.1.1.30 amplicons were purified by exonuclease/
sap treatment and then directly sequenced using bigdye terminator
chemistry on an abi3730 automated sequencer (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca).
sequence analysis
the sequence traces were assembled and scanned for variations from the
reference sequence using 2 parallel mutation detection pipelines: the

1649

mutation profiling pipeline and the polyscan (washington university, st
louis, mo) informatics suite.31 the mutation profiling pipeline consists of
the following steps: (1) analyze data using phred version 0.20425.c to
determine sequence quality;32,33 (2) assemble sequence into contigs using
phrap version 0.990329 (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html);
(3) align contigs to the reference sequence using needle (staden’s package
version 1.6.0);34 and (4) perform automated mutation detection using
informax automated sequence assembly and analysis pipeline (asaap)
version 1.2 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). to manually confirm the tagged
sequence variations, we developed a new graphical user interface called
mutation viewer (mv), where the mutations/polymorphisms are painted
onto a dna schematic showing protein motifs (eg, kinase domain). this
program also prioritizes mutations based on their potential functional
significance (conservative vs nonconservative substitutions), frequency,
and whether they are known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps;
derived by scanning the ncbi28 and ensembl29 snp databases). finally,
specimens from the same patient (eg, tumor versus germ line) were
covisualized, allowing for the rapid identification of somatic mutations. all
gene mutations reported in the literature (eg,  xxxg1605xxx  g12d) or discovered in
our initial analysis were considered “hot spots,” and the relevant sequence
tracings were manually reviewed for all other samples. detailed protocols
and primer sequences are available through the washington university
school of medicine genome sequencing center (gsc) website.35 the
primary sequence data are available at the bioinformatics core website.36
sequence coverage for each amplicon was assessed as follows. sequence traces for each amplicon were aligned with the reference sequence;
alignments with a blast expect score of greater than 1 ⫻ 10⫺35 indicate
poor sequence quality and were considered inadequate coverage. for
amplicons in which more than 15% of samples failed, primers were
redesigned and new amplicons were generated until adequate coverage for
all amplicons was obtained.
statistical analysis
pairwise mutation analyses were done by permutation testing. each pair of
genes was tabulated to determine the frequency of the number of cases with
both mutations present. permutations were done by shuffling the mutation
present/absent values within each gene independently and recalculating
how often both genes were mutated within a single case. this null
distribution was used to determine the significance value of the unpermuted
number of double mutations. the fisher exact test was used to test the
independence of  xxxg1584xxx  mutations from mutations in the grouped tyrosine
kinase pathway genes.

results
patient characteristics

a total of 188 de novo aml samples were analyzed (table 1). for
the discovery set of 94 de novo aml samples obtained at
washington university, both skin (“germ line”) and leukemic cell
genomic dna were obtained. this allowed us to determine
whether an observed nucleotide change in a leukemic sample was
somatically acquired. of note, most of the de novo aml samples
displayed normal or simple cytogenetic abnormalities (table 1);
abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7 were rare.
a total of 17 samples from 14 patients with scn were analyzed
(table 2); 2 of the patients (nos. 14251 and 14252) have been
described previously.18 nine patients had aml, 3 had mds, 1 had
acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), and 1 had a mixed aml/all
picture. most of the scn samples were obtained from children (age
range, 2.9-49.3 y; median, 10.8 y). consistent with previous
reports,3,10 abnormalities of chromosome 7 were common, observed in 6 of the 13 samples where cytogenetics was available.
the dose and duration of g-csf therapy were variable.

sequencing strategy

the genetic progression factors that contribute to leukemogenesis
in the setting of scn are largely unknown. we reasoned that genes
that are frequently mutated in de novo aml might also contribute
to leukemic transformation in scn. a total of 14 genes were
chosen for resequencing; they included  xxxg2198xxx  genes and
genes involved in the transmission of  xxxg2198xxx  signals
( xxxg801xxx , kit,  xxxg525xxx , jak2,  xxxg1605xxx , kras, and  xxxg1894xxx ), myeloid

transcription factors ( xxxg1996xxx , cebpa, and spi1), and  xxxg1584xxx  and
tp53. in addition, we sequenced the  xxxg694xxx  and  xxxg529xxx  genes, since
mutations of these genes have been implicated in leukemic
transformation in scn. the specific exons that were sequenced for
each gene are shown in table s1 (available on the blood website;
see the supplemental materials link at the top of the online article).
a high-throughput sequencing pipeline was employed using
whole-genome–amplified genomic dna and a semiautomated
method to detect mutations. the amount of tumor and/or skin dna
available for many of these samples was very limited, necessitating
whole-genome amplification to create adequate amounts of template for exonic amplification and resequencing. since large-scale
resequencing with whole-genome–amplified dna has not previously been reported, it was first necessary to “credential” this
material for analysis by assessing the frequency of known mutations in a large cohort of de novo aml patients.
a crucial factor in assessing mutation frequency is the quality and
coverage of the sequences obtained. therefore, we developed an
automated method to rapidly assess sequence quality and coverage.
figure 1 contains a representative sequence coverage map for exon 2 of
 xxxg1605xxx . high-quality double-stranded (green) or single-stranded (yellow)
sequence was observed for nearly all of the samples. for the purposes of
this study, a given sample had to meet 2 criteria to be considered to have
adequate sequence coverage. first, for genes with mutational hot spots
(eg, codons 12, 13, and 64 for  xxxg1605xxx ), this region had to have at least
single-stranded sequence coverage. second, sequence gaps (if any) in
the coding region had to be less than 10 nucleotides in length. based on
these criteria, only 5 of 210 tumor samples (both de novoaml and scn
samples) had inadequate sequence coverage for  xxxg1605xxx  (figure 1). in
fact, the sequence quality and coverage was high for all analyzed genes,
with an average of 95% plus or minus 4.3% of samples having adequate
coverage (range, 86%-100%). in each case where inadequate sequence
coverage was obtained, the sample was eliminated from the final
analysis of the relevant gene mutation frequency.
frequency of gene mutations in de novo aml

to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our sequencing pipeline,
we first sequenced the 188 de novo aml samples, since the
frequency of mutations in these genes had previously been
established. figure 2 summarizes the nucleotide deletions, insertions, and nonsynonymous single-nucleotide changes that were

detected in the discovery set of 94 de novo aml samples;
single-nucleotide changes present in the ncbi28 or ensembl29 snp
databases were excluded from analysis. consistent with previous
reports, the 4 genes most often mutated were  xxxg801xxx ,38  xxxg1584xxx ,39
 xxxg1605xxx ,37,40 and cebpa,41 with frequencies in our discovery set of
27.7%, 25.5%, 9.6%, and 5.3%, respectively (table 3). as reported
previously, somatic mutations of kit,42 kras,40  xxxg1894xxx ,43 jak2,44
 xxxg1996xxx ,45 tp53,46 and spi147,48 were observed but infrequent
(⬍ 5%). no somatic mutations of  xxxg525xxx  (encoding  xxxg525xxx ),  xxxg694xxx ,
or  xxxg529xxx  were detected. very similar data were obtained with the
calgb set of de novo aml samples (figure s1). to conserve
resources,  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg529xxx  were not sequenced in this set.
collectively, the frequency of gene mutations in our de novo aml
samples was comparable to that reported in the literature, validating our use of whole-genome–amplified dna for the resequencing
pipeline (table 3).
the multiplexed gene sequencing approach allowed us to look
for associations between gene mutations; 2 significant associations
were observed (figure 2). although the numbers were small, a
significant positive association between kit mutations and  xxxg1996xxx 
mutations was observed (p ⫽ .027). as reported previously,49 a
trend toward a positive association between  xxxg801xxx  mutations and
 xxxg1584xxx  mutations was also observed (p ⫽ .076). indeed, after

grouping the  xxxg2198xxx  pathway genes ( xxxg801xxx , kit,  xxxg525xxx ,
 xxxg1605xxx , kras,  xxxg1894xxx , and jak2) together, the association with
mutations of  xxxg1584xxx  was significant (p ⫽ .049). a negative association of  xxxg2198xxx  pathway gene mutations with each other was
observed, but it was not statistically significant (ie, mutations of
 xxxg801xxx , kit, jak2, or  xxxg1894xxx  were never seen in the same sample;
figure 2). the same pattern does not appear to hold true for ras
mutations, since  xxxg1605xxx  and kras mutations were seen in association with  xxxg801xxx  or kit mutations.
frequency of gene mutations in scn aml/all/mds

for the scn samples, only tumor (bone marrow) samples were
available, so we were unable to directly address whether the
observed nucleotide changes were acquired. as expected, over
40% of patients (6 of 14) with scn carried mutations (presumably germ line) in  xxxg694xxx  (figure 3). consistent with a previous
report,18 g185r  xxxg694xxx  mutations are frequent in patients with
scn who have progressed to leukemia or aml.  xxxg529xxx 
mutations were observed in 6 of 14 patients (42.8%). in 1 case
(no. 12400), the  xxxg529xxx  mutation was clearly acquired, since it
was not present in a preleukemic sample (no. 12380) from the
same patient. in contrast to the de novo aml samples, no

in this study, we used high-throughput exonic resequencing to
determine the mutation frequency of 14 aml-associated genes in
patients with scn-associated aml. to validate our resequencing
methodologies, we sequenced the regions containing these common mutations in 188 de novo aml samples and found that our
pipeline detected all of these mutations at the expected frequencies.
the pattern of mutations in the scn-mds/leukemia samples was
distinct, since no mutations in  xxxg1584xxx , cebpa, or  xxxg801xxx  were
detected. as expected, we found that the  xxxg529xxx  gene was
frequently mutated in scn-aml but not in de novo aml. these

results therefore suggest that the genetic basis of scn-aml is
different from that of de novo aml. however, it is important to
note that de novo aml samples analyzed in this study had
certain favorable biologic features compared with the scn
samples, including the lack of antecedent myelodysplasia and
relatively few cytogenetic abnormalities. these features make
comparisons of the 2 groups difficult, but the new information
regarding the scn-aml patients is still informative regarding
their pathophysiology.
mutations of  xxxg529xxx  are present in a substantial proportion of
patients with scn. in the largest published series, which included
121 patients with scn,  xxxg529xxx  mutations were detected in 41%.23
these mutations are acquired, typically heterozygous, and nearly
always introduce a premature stop codon resulting in the truncation
of the distal cytoplasmic portion of the g- xxxg525xxx .19-22  xxxg529xxx 
mutations are strongly associated with the development of aml/
mds. germeshausen et al23 reported that the incidence of  xxxg529xxx 
mutations was 78% (18/23) in individuals with scn and monosomy 7, mds, or aml compared with 34% (43/125) in patients
without mds or aml. in the present study,  xxxg529xxx  mutations were
detected in 43% (6/14) of scn patients with malignant transformation. the lower incidence of  xxxg529xxx  mutations in our study is likely
due to differences in the methods used to detect  xxxg529xxx  mutations.
in the study by germeshausen et al,23 sequencing was performed
on pcr-amplified cdna after reverse transcription of hematopoietic cell rna; using this approach, they were able to detect  xxxg529xxx 
mutations in samples in which only 5% of the cells contained this
mutation. in contrast, our method of direct amplification of tumor
dna to generate amplicons for resequencing has been shown to
reliably detect mutations that are present in at least 33% of cells
(this applies to all genes sequenced in this study).26 consistent with
previous reports,23,52,53 no  xxxg529xxx  mutations were detected in the de
novo aml samples, suggesting that  xxxg529xxx  mutations are rare in
de novo aml.
accumulating data suggest that activating mutations of
 xxxg2198xxx  genes may play a key role in leukemogenesis.
indeed, we detected mutations of  xxxg2198xxx  genes ( xxxg801xxx ,
kit, and jak2) in 30% of de novo aml samples. there is
evidence suggesting that the truncation mutations of  xxxg529xxx 
observed in scn are likewise activating. expression of mutant
g- xxxg525xxx  in myeloid cell lines results in enhanced proliferative
and survival signals.19,54,55 moreover, transgenic mice carrying
truncating mutations of  xxxg529xxx  display a hyperproliferative
response to g-csf.24,25 since the g- xxxg525xxx  and receptor tyrosine

kinases share many signaling pathways, these observations
suggest that the mutant g- xxxg525xxx  present in many cases of
scn-aml may provide the “activated  xxxg2198xxx  signal
[pathway].” this hypothesis predicts that mutations of tyrosine
kinase genes associated with de novo aml would not be
required for disease progression. consistent with this prediction, no activating mutations of the  xxxg2198xxx  genes were
observed in the scn samples (0/14; p ⫽ .007 compared with de
novo aml). the rarity of  xxxg2198xxx  gene mutations in
scn is unlikely to be related to the age of the patients or the
complexity of karyotypic abnormalities. the mutation frequency of  xxxg801xxx  and kit in childhood aml is 19% and 3%,
respectively56,57; similar to that reported for adult aml. of
particular relevance to scn, the frequency of  xxxg801xxx  mutations
in aml with karyotypic abnormalities of chromosome 7 is
5.8%.38 in addition, since therapy-related mds/aml shares
many features with scn-aml (including a high incidence
of chromosome 7 abnormalities and a history of antecedent
mds), it is noteworthy that the reported frequency of  xxxg801xxx 
mutations in therapy-related mds/aml ranges from 4.3% to
7.8%.58,59 finally, a recent study reported that activating kit
mutations were present in 19% of patients with aml arising in
the setting of mds (mds-aml), another condition associated
with a high frequency of chromosome 7 abnormalities.61
collectively, these data suggest that the rarity of  xxxg2198xxx  gene
mutations is a unique finding in scn-mds/aml and support the
hypothesis that  xxxg529xxx  mutations provide the activated  xxxg2198xxx 
signal that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.
in the present study, only a single  xxxg1605xxx  or kras mutation
was detected in the 14 scn-aml/mds samples. similarly, a
preliminary study reported a 7% frequency of ras mutations
(1/14 cases of scn aml/mds).61 in contrast, an earlier study
reported a ras mutation frequency of 38% (5/13 cases of scn
aml/mds).10 interestingly, most of the patients in this earlier
study were older and had not been treated with g-csf from
infancy. consequently, it is possible that long-term g-csf
therapy selects for  xxxg529xxx  mutations, reducing the need for ras
mutations during disease progression. consistent with this
possibility, resequencing of 3 of the original 5 cases of scn
aml/mds with ras mutations revealed that none of these
cases had mutations of  xxxg529xxx .61 the mutual exclusivity of
activating ras and  xxxg529xxx  mutations suggests that these genes
may act on a shared pathway; however, it should be noted thatthe sole
scn sample in our study with a kras mutation also
had a  xxxg529xxx  mutation. in any case, combining data from all of these
studies, the frequency of ras mutations in scn mds/leukemia is
approximately 15%, similar to that reported for de novo aml.
the frequency of  xxxg1584xxx  mutations has been reported to be
approximately 35% in adult de novo aml39 and 6.5% in pediatric
de novo aml.63 in the present study, no  xxxg1584xxx  mutations were
detected in the 14 scn samples versus 24% in the de novo aml
samples (p ⫽ .04). of note,  xxxg1584xxx  mutations are more fre-

quently detected in aml samples with a normal karyotype; the
frequency of  xxxg1584xxx  mutations in de novo aml with an
abnormal karyotype is only 6.4%.63 since most cases of
scn-mds/aml are associated with an abnormal karyotype,
this may partially account for the reduced  xxxg1584xxx  mutation
frequency in these samples. nonetheless, the data suggest that
mutations of the  xxxg1584xxx  are rare during leukemic progression in
scn patients.
there is accumulating evidence that the genetic changes that
contribute to secondary leukemias, including therapy-related
aml and aml arising in the setting of mds (mds-aml), are
distinct from those that contribute to the pathogenesis of de
novo aml. the present data suggest that the mutations that
contribute to scn-aml are more similar to those of the
secondary aml syndromes. similar to therapy-related aml and
mds-aml, mutations of  xxxg1584xxx  and cebpa are rare in
scn-mds/aml, whereas abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and
7 are more common than in de novo aml. the one outlier is
 xxxg529xxx , where mutations appear to be uniquely associated with
scn. given the poor prognosis of scn-aml and other
secondary leukemia syndromes, it will be important to identify
the genes that contribute to transformation under these circumstances. these data will improve our understanding of the
mechanisms of leukemic transformation and may provide new
targets for drug design.
