expert opinion

importance of the field: more than 1 million epilepsy patients suffer from
insufficiently controlled epilepsy, both in the usa and in europe.  xxxd3564xxx 
is an antiepileptic drug with multiple mechanisms of action, corresponding to
efficacy in diverse epilepsy syndromes.
areas covered in this review: here, an update on pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety in childhood and adult epilepsies is
given based on an analysis of controlled and uncontrolled studies, european,
us and east asian, and on clinical experience with  xxxd3564xxx  (zns) published
up to 2009.
what the reader will gain: evidence is presented that zns is effective not only
in adult focal epilepsies, for which it has been approved in the usa and in europe,
but also may offer treatment options for compassionate use in a spectrum of
difficult-to-treat epilepsy syndromes. its favorable pharmacokinetic profile
allows for easy combination with most available antiepileptic drugs.
take home message: provided that additional studies on zns are performed
to extend approval and to generate comparative data, zns has a potential to
gain importance in the treatmnt of a wide spectrum of epilepsy patients.

introduction

epilepsy is one of the most common diseases of the brain, with more than 5 million
patients affected in the eu (2003), and more than 3 million in the usa [1]. in the
wide spectrum of epilepsy syndromes, about 2/3 of this patients can be treated
satisfactorily, that is complete and long-lasting seizure control can be achieved with
no or tolerable side effects. about 40% of patients with focal epilepsy, and at least
10 – 20% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy pose problems to available
epilepsy treatments, related to efficacy and tolerability of drugs [2,3]. the increased
number of available ‘second-generation’ antiepileptic drugs since 1992 has markedly
broadened treatment options that are at hand to achieve an individual optimization
of medical treatment. a proper selection for a given patient requires profound
knowledge with regard to the individual antiepileptic substances.
a number of treatment of guidelines have been published which give some
priorities to certain treatment regimens, yet tolerability and efficacy of treatments are
hardly predictable on an individual basis. typically, use of monotherapy is
advocated in early phases of the epilepsy and polytherapy only after failure of
monotherapy attempts; and sometimes the use of first-generation antiepileptic
drugs like carbamazepine or valproate before newer agents, in part based on
economic reasoning.
a preference for monotherapy in the initial treatment of epilepsy is based on
advantages related to simplicity of intake and patient compliance, a lesser risk of
interactions, and to possible cost savings. data supporting these notions, however,
mostly stem from the 1970s and 1980s, when antiepileptic drugs with a limited

spectrum of mechanism of action and strong enzyme inducers
with high liability for pharmacokinetic interactions were
available. by contrast, there is little evidence showing inferiority of second-generation combination therapy, and the few
available more recent drugs even point to possible advantages
of early combinations [4]. certainly, combination therapy is
used widely in patients refractory to initial monotherapy
attempts. again, evidence supporting a particular type
of combination therapy is lacking, thus giving a wide
range for individual treatment decisions by physicians in
everyday practice.
a number of aspects can influence the selection of drugs
used in combinations. the mode of action of antiepileptic
drugs to be combined may be complementary in controlling
epilepsy. this has been shown in a large number of randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies performed to
provide evidence for the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs released
from 1992 to 2009. besides, a similar efficacy as a high-dosed
action on a single target may be achieved with fewer side
effects. thus, combinations of several sodium-channel blockers may be inferior both in efficacy and in tolerability compared with drugs targeting independent mechanisms
controlling epileptic activity, for example substances affecting
presynaptic transmitter release, postsynaptic efficacy of
gaba-ergic inhibition or glutamatergic excitation, and
other mechanisms like targeting opening probabilities of
voltage-gated ion channels.
pharmacokinetic interactions within a combination therapy
and in relation to other drugs administered, at present a
potential source of problems, may be highly relevant to
drug selection in an individual patient. thus, the use of
enzyme inducers in combination with drugs undergoing
hepatic or renal metabolism may render it difficult to achieve
appropriate drug concentrations in the blood serum and at
cerebral target structures. the availability of antiepileptic
drugs without hepatic enzyme induction may help to avoid
116

some long-term side effects of antiepileptic therapy (e.g., with
regard to bone health) [5]. furthermore, combinations of drugs
not highly bound to serum proteins may help to avoid
nonlinear interactions on the effective, free drug levels.
a reliable bioavailability and the possibility to use once- or
twice-daily dosing also contribute to a good acceptance of
antiepileptic drugs, in monotherapy or in combination.
improvements in the pharmacokinetic profile of secondgeneration antiepileptic drugs thus may be relevant to
antiepileptic long-term treatment.
 xxxd3564xxx  (zns; box 1) has been available in japan since
1989, in south korea since 1992, in the usa since 2000, and
in the eu since 2005. whereas it is being used in japan and
korea in a wide spectrum of focal and generalized epilepsies,
its approval in the usa and europe is limited to focal
epilepsies. in addition, zns is licensed for children and adults
in japan and korea, for adolescents older than 16 years and
adults in the us, but only for adults in europe. overall, there
is experience with more than 2 million patient years in
treatment with zns [6]. in the following, information on
structure and function of zns, its clinical pharmacology and
practical issues of treatment is given.
2.

structure of  xxxd3564xxx 

 xxxd3564xxx  is a benzisoxazole compound with a sulfonamide
side chain ( xxxd3564xxx , figure 1).
it is structurally unrelated to other available antiepileptic
drugs. it is metabolized by the liver and by the kidney
involving glucuronide conjugation, acetylation, hydroxylation, oxidation of the sulfamoylmethyl group, and cleavage
of the n–o bond. the enzyme primarily involved in its
reduction before glucuronide conjugation is cyp 450 3a4;
there is no induction of inhibition of cyp450 isoenzymes and
no self-induction of metabolism. both n-acetylated and
glucuronized metabolites are inactive [7]. reduction and glucuronation contribute to about 50% of the drug metabolism
in caucasians, n-acetylation another 20%; 15 – 30% of zns
are renally excreted unchanged; in east asia, the n-acetylation
pathway is preferentially used [8]. renal clearance is higher in
children, and in patients with marked renal impairment dose
adjustment may be necessary.
the drug is commercially available in tablets of 25, 50 and
100 mg. most commonly, daily dosages between 100 and
600 mg have been applied, but higher doses have been used
and may be considered individually.
3.

pharmakodynamics

several modes of action are known which are thought to
contribute to the antiepileptic properties of  xxxd3564xxx . at a
presynaptic level, gaba-release is increased [9], whereas glutamate release is decreased [10]. at the level of the synapse,
 xxxd3564xxx  downregulates the gaba-transporter 1, which
removes gaba from the synaptic cleft, and upregulates

n-acetyl-zns (c).

glutamate-transporter 1, which removes glutamate from the
synaptic cleft [11]. in summary, these mechanisms lead to an
increased concentrations of gaba and decreased levels of
glutamate in the synaptic cleft.
at the level of membrane intrinsic voltage-gated ion channels,  xxxd3564xxx  prolongs the inactive state of voltage-sensitive
sodium channels [12] similar to carbamazepine, phenytoin,
lamotrigine, and of voltage-sensitive t-type calcium channels
similar to  xxxd2056xxx  and valproate [13].  xxxd3564xxx  also
effects the role of which for epilepsy treatment is less clear: this
includes increases in extracellular serotonin and dopamine
levels [14,15], an increase in acetylcholine turnover, an inhibition of carboanhydrase (although expressed less than 1/100
times that of acetazolamide [16,17]), and activity as a free radical
scavenger [18].
 xxxd3564xxx  thus affects epileptic activity at several levels
which may be related to efficacy in a wide spectrum of epilepsy
models and human epilepsy syndromes [19]. it has been shown
to have antiepileptic actions in the maximal electroshock
model of generalized seizures in the mouse and in the rat,
in genetic models of reflex epilepsy and of epilepsies with tonic
seizures, whereas it was not effective in pentylenetetrazolinduced generalized tonic-clonic seizures and in genetic
absence models. furthermore, it has been shown to be
effective in several kindling models of focal epilepsy.
4.

pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3564xxx 

pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and in epilepsy
patients have proven a rapid and almost complete absorption
(> 95%), which is not affected by food intake. there is a linear
dose–plasma concentration relationship in single doses from
100 to 800 mg/day [20,21], yet clearance may decrease at high
dosages under steady-state conditions [22].  xxxd3564xxx  is
rapidly absorbed with maximal serum concentrations reached
within 2 – 5 h in fasted state and within 4 – 6 h if taken with
meals [21]. the elimination half-life (t½) ranging from 50 to
68 h is the longest of all second-generation drugs. this allows
for once-daily dosing with only minor fluctuations in plasma
concentrations; bioavailability with once-daily intake is 84%
of that achieved in b.i.d. intake [23]. once-daily dosing may
increase compliance of intake [24,25], whereas twice-daily
intake may be preferred to maintain fairly stable drug

concentrations even if a single dose is missed. long elimination half-life, however, also implies a latency of 10 – 14 days
until steady-state plasma concentrations are reached.  xxxd3564xxx  readily binds to erythrocytes; only 40 – 60% of the drug
are protein-bound. protein-binding is not affected by other
antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin,  xxxd2908xxx  and carbamazepine [26].  xxxd3564xxx  readily penetrates across lipid
membranes and the blood–brain barrier and achieves similar
concentrations in the brain as in the plasma; similarly, it passes
into breast milk.
 xxxd3564xxx  has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. used in combination therapy with other antiepileptic
drugs, mostly no effects on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine [27], lamotrigine [28], phenytoin [29] and valproate [30]
were found. there may be, however, a reduction of phenytoin
elimination by 14% [31], an increase in concentrations of
carbamazepine-epoxide in patients treated with carbamazepine [32]. there are no interactions with sulfonamides, cimetidine,  xxxd3535xxx  or oral contraceptives [21]. strong enzyme
inducers like phenytoin, carbamazepine and  xxxd2908xxx 
reduce the plasma half-life to 27 h and 38 h, respectively [19];
also valproate decreases plasma half-life to a lesser degree.
higher dosages may thus be required in such combinations,
and drug dosages may have to be adjusted in the case of a
combined enzyme-inducing drug being withdrawn. in individual cases, an increase in zns concentration was reported
with addition of lamotrigine [33].
5.

clinical efficacy

clinical efficacy of  xxxd3564xxx  has been shown in four
randomized, controlled trials in focal epilepsy and in a large
number of open studies involving both children and adults
with idiopathic generalized and focal epilepsies in japan,
although most of them are available in english only in
summaries [34,35].
 xxxd3564xxx  in the treatment of focal epilepsy
licensing for the add-on treatment of focal epilepsy in
the usa and in europe is based on four randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of
850 patients [36-39]. patients included were male or female
aged 12 – 77 years (mean age 33 – 37 years) with simple partial

or complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. after a prospective baseline period of 4 – 12 weeks,
 xxxd3564xxx  at daily dosages of 100 – 600 mg/day given once or
twice daily was added to 1 – 3 pre-existing antiepileptic drugs;
blinded evaluation periods consisted of 12 – 24 weeks.
studies unanimously showed significant effects on median
seizure rates and on the number of patients showing a 50%
seizure reduction compared with placebo in dose ranges of
300 – 600 mg/day (figure 2) with the only exception of the
study of brodie et al. [39], in which a mean reduction of complex
partial seizures by 40.1% did not achieve statistical significance.
simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalized
tonic-clonic seizures were similarly reduced in frequency. at
maximal applied dosages of 400 – 600 mg in these trials, seizure
reduction rates ranged from 25 to 46% corresponding to
responder rates (patients with more than 50% seizure

reduction) of 28 – 46% (figure 2). in these add-on trials,
effects of low dosages of  xxxd3564xxx  (100 – 200 mg/day) on
seizure rates were not consistently better than placebo.
reported seizure-free rates at high zns dosages were 6
versus 3% [37] and 5 versus 2% [39] under placebo treatment.
in the study of brodie et al. [39], seizure-free rates of up to 9%
were reported when analyses were confined to the last 4-week
period. a cochrane review regards the efficacy of  xxxd3564xxx  in
the treatment of focal epilepsy as consistent between trials [40].
in addition to the evidence for the efficacy of  xxxd3564xxx  in
add-on treatment of focal epilepsy, open-label and active
comparator studies provide relevant data on the efficacy of
 xxxd3564xxx  under more realistic treatment conditions.
long-term follow-up studies in patients undergoing adjunctive  xxxd3564xxx  treatment at dosages of 300 – 600 mg/day
support sustained efficacy in those patients having profited

adapted from [48].

from the introduction of the drug [41-47]. in a comparative
analysis on retention rates of second-generation antiepileptic
drugs [48], zns retention after 2 years of treatment was 60.2%,
which ranked it second after lamotrigine, but higher than
 xxxd2809xxx ,  xxxd2466xxx  and topiramate (figure 3).
retrospective open analyses of zns treatment have given
rather diverse results. whereas most studies report responder
rates of 35 – 57% in adjunctive therapy [49-53], some reports
suggest low efficacy [54], whereas others reported seizure-free
rates of up to 45% of 60 patients. one prospective open-label
study reported improvements in quality of life in parallel
with improved seizure control under add-on zns therapy [55]. in addition, epilepsy syndromes were not well
specified. so far, there is little information as to which
drug combinations with zns are particularly favorable;
the combination of zns with topiramate may, however,
be disadvantageous [56].
zns use in monotherapy
although approved only for adjunctive therapy in europe and
in the usa, efficacy in monotherapy has been reported in a
number of trials [35,57,58]. only one study used an active
comparator to evaluate zns treatment efficacy also in monotherapy [59]. here, a mean dosage of 330 mg zns was
compared with 600 mg carbamazepine (cbz), showing at
least similar efficacy of zns in controlling partial seizures:
reduction in seizure frequency was 68.4% with zns
versus 46.6% with cbz, responder rates 82% with zns
and 71% with cbz (difference ns). discontinuation rates
were also similar, with a tendency towards frequent occurrence
of ataxia under treatment with cbz, and of somnolence
with zns.
a comparison of 7.3 mg/kg/day zns with 27.6 mg/kg/day
valproate in children with generalized seizures showed similar
efficacy [60].
5.2

as expected in these patient groups, monotherapy more
often resulted in complete seizure control and had higher
responder rates (often 80 – 90%) compared with difficultto-treat patients undergoing polytherapy, even when only
retrospective data are compared [7,35,57,58,61]. a reporting
bias was present in a korean study reporting seizure freedom
in 45% and an additional reduction of seizure frequency by
50% in one third of patients under zns monotherapy [62], as
patients withdrawing from the medication during the first
6 months of treatment were not included. in general, better
seizure control in patients treated in monotherapy probably
reflects the earlier stage of epilepsy and correspondingly higher
responsiveness to medical treatment compared with often
highly refractory patients undergoing add-on treatment. it
is also of interest that, in patients groups treated in monotherapy, often dosages as low as 100 mg/day, which were of
questionable effect in trials of adjunctive zns therapy in
pharmacoresistant patients with focal epilepsy, were effective
and could lead to complete seizure freedom (e.g., in 44% of
patients in a report from houston [57]).
efficacy in the treatment of idiopathic generalized
epilepsy

5.3

 xxxd3564xxx  is licensed for the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (ige) only in asia, whereas multicentric
european studies to evaluate its potency was cancelled. there
are a number of japanese studies in children with ige
reporting a good efficacy of the drug (for review see [34,35]),
often with low numbers of patients included. recent reports
unanimously report zns efficacy in a diversity of ige
subsyndromes, including absence epilepsy [63-66], in epilepsy
with generalized tonic-clonic seizures [66-68], and in juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy (jme) [66,69-75]. it is of particular interest
that most of the patients reported here were nonresponders to
valproate and other drugs considered as first- or second-line

drugs in ige, and that patients could profit considerably,
sometimes achieving complete seizure control for all or most
seizure types when treated with zns [75]. as data from
uncontrolled studies indicate, zns efficacy may be even
higher in ige compared with focal epilepsies [35,76]. recent
reviews suggest zns as a possible option for first-line therapy
in jme particularly in obese patients [77].
in the author’s view, it is unfortunate that there are no
ongoing randomized controlled studies which could render
zns approval for ige patients. thus, only compassionate use
in individual patients with unsatisfactory seizure control with
other antiepileptic drugs can be considered for zns use in the
usa and europe.
experiences in neuropediatric and difficult-to-treat
syndromes

5.4

both japanese trials in children [34,61,78] and retrospective
reports from compassionate use in the usa and europe
show that zns is effective also in children suffering from
diverse epilepsy syndromes. in particular, efficacy has been
shown in focal epilepsies [78], iges (see above), in landau–
kleffner syndrome [79], dravet syndrome [80], ohtahara
syndrome [81,82], west syndrome [35,83-86], and in lennox
gastaut syndrome [35,87-89], both in monotherapy and in
adjunctive therapy.
it is of particular interest that also patients with the
difficult-to-treat progressive myoclonus epilepsies both of
unverricht lundborg and of lafora type may show a
considerable response to zns treatment [90-95].
a case series has furthermore suggested that zns treatment
might be particularly effective in patients with glucose transporter 1 deficiency [96]; this observation certainly needs
replication in larger patient numbers.
in summary, the numerous reports of efficacy also in these
difficult-to-treat syndromes and in mentally retarded children
(table 1) [97] support the notion that zns has to be ranked
among antiepileptic drugs with a wide therapeutic spectrum
and high anticonvulsant efficacy.

6.

safety and tolerability

as with all antiepileptic drugs, treatment-emergent side effects
occur with zns. these include both cns-related and other
types. the characterization of purely zns-related side effects
is hampered by limited available data on zns monotherapy.
in placebo-controlled add-on trials in focal epilepsy, zns
treatment led to some form of adverse events in 78% of
patients versus 68% in placebo treatment [6]. severe adverse
events were rare and in controlled trials did not
occur significantly more frequent than in the placebo arm.
it is of note that many side effects occurred in the titration
phase and not during treatment at steady state with the
highest individually prescribed dosages; this points to the
importance of slow introduction of zns to improve
tolerability [36,44].
cns-related side effects
under add-on treatment, somnolence, dizziness, agitation/
irritability, fatigue, tiredness and ataxia were more frequent
than under placebo treatment [98]. these side effects belong to
a similar spectrum as those observed in many antiepileptic
drugs (e.g., sodium channel inhibitors). a recent meta-analysis
found only somnolence and dizziness to be significantly
reported as zns-related side effects [99].
6.1

cognition
systematic evaluations of cognition under therapy with zns
are rare. often, cognitive side effects are not specified and
summarized as ‘sedation’. although reported in several analyses, only three pilot studies and one prospective assessment of
cognitive functions using neuropsychological test batteries are
available. berent et al. [100] reported dose-related worsening of
cognitive functions, particularly in memory, after introduction of zns in nine patients. deficits were mostly reversible
after 24 weeks of ongoing zns treatment. wilensky et al. [101]
revealed in a very small crossover pilot study that patients
under zns compared with cbz had lower scores in the
wechsler intelligence test. in a prospective randomized study
in 43 patients treated with 100 – 400 mg/day zns in
monotherapy, park et al. [102] recently reported cognitive
and mood problems, which led to a withdrawal of the
medication in 3/43 patients. in 34 patients undergoing
repeated neuropsychological testing, deterioration in word
list learning, immediate and delayed word recall, visual reproduction, mental flexibility, verbal fluency and verbal shortterm and working memory were found even after 1 year of
therapy. some of these changes were related to dosage, as
particularly patients under 300 or 400 mg/day showed impairments. sixteen patients (47% of those undergoing testing)
complained of subjectively experienced cognitive effects
(memory, attention/concentration, speech and calculation);
this was significantly more frequent under 400 mg/day than
with lower dosages. these cognitive side effects have been
reported as similar as with topiramate [102]. in our experience,
6.1.1

schulze-bonhage

especially impairment of short-term memory functions
are, however, milder expressed with zns compared with
topiramate [103]. in this limited patient sample, no deterioration in long-term memory functions occurred under
zns therapy.

under zns treatment remain asymptomatic [107]. patients
with a family history of renal calculi may be at higher risk, and
appropriate fluid intake may be protective. drug discontinuation is not required in all cases [116], and in our personal
experience, calculi readily dissolve without sequelae.

psychiatric effects
in a study of park et al. [102], no significant effects of zns
treatment on either beck depression inventory or beck anxiety
inventory were found under zns monotherapy; for both scales,
scores were lower under zns than before initiation of therapy.
mood stabilization has been reported in patients with bipolar
disorder treated with zns; in individual patients, however, a
deterioration of mood could happen. individual cases of
psychoses and behavioral disorder have been reported [104-106];
these episodes were reversible with withdrawal of the drug.

oligohidrosis
in some reports of children treated with zns, oligohidrosis
and hyperthermia have been reported under treatment with
zns [61,117], similar to topiramate and acetazolamide.
the incidence was estimated as 1/4590 patient years, and
oligohidrosis is reversible with drug discontinuation [118].
severely handicapped children may be particularly liable to
this rare side effect [119].

6.2

non-cns related side effects
anorexia

6.2.1

a common non-cns-related side effect is a decrease in
appetite (anorexia), sometimes associated with gastrointestinal
problems, resulting in weight loss [58,65,94,107]. in a review, a
mean weight decrease of 3.1 kg was reported after a mean
treatment duration of 11 months [108]. this corresponds well
to a recent report, which found a mean weight reduction by
3 kg after a mean zns treatment duration of 13 months [109];
35% of patients lost more than 5% of their body weight. also
in placebo-controlled trials, weight losses were mostly below
5 kg within the period of observation. in individual
cases, however, and particularly in overweight patients, weight
loss may be expressed more and may proceed with longer
treatment periods. subjectively, anorexia under treatment
with zns was reported in 12.3% of patients undergoing
zns treatment in placebo-controlled trials [43]; this figure
corresponds to 16% in patients under long-term topiramate
treatment [110].  xxxd3564xxx  is believed to have potential as a
weight-control drug for a range of conditions [111,112]. weight
reduction may be welcomed by some patients, but the loss of
appetite may also be regarded as a relevant side effect leading
to drug discontinuation in others.
renal calculi
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors induce a shift of urine ph in
distal renal tubules to the alkaline; this increases the risk of
renal calcium phosphate calculi in patients treated with zns,
similar to treatments with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
like topiramate [113], and acetazolamide [114]. whereas no
such side effects were reported during us and european
placebo-controlled trials of zns, they may be related to
long-term treatment and to treatment at high dosages [44].
reported incidences range from < 1% in a european openlabel extension study [43] to 3.5% in a long-term extension

allergic reactions
allergic reactions are known to occur with sulfonamide
antimicrobials [120]. in placebo-controlled trials in the usa
and europe, the incidence of severe rash was 3 in 1207 cases,
and there was no clear dose relation. similar frequencies of
rash were also reported in retrospective analyses (e.g.,
1.8% [58]). severe allergic reactions like stevens–johnson
syndrome are known from zns use in japan [121].
as the sulfonamide side chain is assumed to play a role in
allergic reactions, patient history should include active questioning as to the presence of any previous allergic reaction to
sulfonamide-containing drugs.
6.2.4

other
one study performing repeated ecg acquisitions reported a
qt-prolongation of uncertain significance under znstreatment by 1.2% (4.7 ms) [117]. in rare cases, pareasthesias
have been reported [122] similar to those occurring with
topiramate, although the incidence may be lower.
so far there are insufficient data available on possible
teratogenic effects of zns. according to data from the
pharmaceutical industry, animal studies showed abortive
and teratogenic effects; thus, the use of zns thus cannot at
present be recommended during pregnancy. the exact teratogenic potential of zns cannot be assessed from preliminary
reports on pregnancy outcome [123]. in the future, data from
pregnancy registers will in the long term clarify how the risks of
zns treatment compare to other antiepileptic drugs.
some studies also report favorable side effects, not only with
respect to weight loss but also to improvement in mood,
alertness and pain (see, for example, [58]); the potential benefit
of zns (e.g., in neuropsychiatric disorders [124]) and headache
(see, for example, [125]) is increasingly discussed.

conclusions

 xxxd3564xxx  is an antiepileptic drug with unique structure and
multiple mechanisms of antiepileptic action which render it
efficacious in a wide range of focal and generalized epilepsies.
in europe and in the usa, it is licensed for the treatment of

focal epilepsy in adults, but there is ample evidence for widespectrum efficacy of the drug including primary generalized
epilepsies and various difficult-to-treat childhood syndromes
including west syndrome and lennox gastaut syndrome.
a lack of large-scale randomized controlled studies limits a
more extensive use of zns also in monotherapy, in children
and in epilepsies other than focal both in europe and in the
usa. this is regrettable as uncontrolled data indicate that
zns might be helpful also in difficult-to-treat epilepsy syndromes in which currently approved drugs often do not
provide the desirable efficacy.
a low potential for interactions renders zns a treatment
option in various combinations with other antiepileptic drugs.
long plasma half-life allows for simple dosing schemes
but require some patience during up-titration to avoid
unnecessary cns-related side effects. both slow up-titration
and therapy starting with low dosages (100 – 300 mg/day
or 2 – 5 mg/kg/day in children) often improves
tolerability considerably.
experiences with long-term treatment of large patient
populations in east asia, the usa and europe suggest an
overall favorable safety profile, and recent data indicate that its
retention rate ranks well among second-generation antiepileptic drugs. although the drug has been marketed for 20 years
now, however, data from prospective trials are scarce, and
there is certainly a need for additional studies in a number of
pediatric epilepsy syndromes, and to address several aspects of
tolerability, for example regarding the effects of zns of mood
and cognition. data on teratogenicity of zns are to be
expected from pregnancy registries only in the long term.
furthermore, additional comparative studies are necessary to

122

establish the relative role of zns compared with other current
antiepileptic drugs, not only in focal epilepsies.

expert opinion

 xxxd3564xxx  is an antiepileptic drug that adds an agent with
multiple mechanisms of action and efficacy in a wide
spectrum of epilepsy syndromes. advantages include easy
handling both in monotherapy and in adjunctive therapy
with other antiepileptic drugs, efficacy in several difficult-totreat epilepsy syndromes in which other antiepileptic drugs
do not provide sufficient seizure control, and an overall good
tolerability as expressed by few severe side effects and long
retention rates. often, desirable weight effects make it a
particular treatment option in the obese patient; the role of
possible cognitive and mood effects remains to be assessed. in
the view of the author, the role of zns has suffered in the
past and still suffers now from a lack of prospective studies
which presently limits its approval in the usa and europe to
focal epilepsies and adult patients. monotherapy trials, trials
in idiopathic generalized epilepsies and in childhood syndromes like progressive myoclonus epilepsies could open up
the window to a full appraisal of the potential of this drug in
epilepsy therapy.
