decreased incidence of anterior uveitis in
patients with  xxxg1055xxx  treated with the
anti– xxxg2296xxx  agents  xxxd2355xxx  and etanercept

logic agents directed against tnf␣ is associated with a
significant decrease in the number of anterior uveitis
flares. this reduction was slightly more marked among
patients treated with  xxxd2355xxx , but the difference was
not significant.

objective. to estimate the incidence of anterior
uveitis in patients with  xxxg1055xxx  (as) who
underwent anti– xxxg2296xxx  (anti-tnf) therapy, using data from recently performed trials.
methods. data from 4 placebo-controlled studies
with anti-tnf agents in as (2 with etanercept and 2
with  xxxd2355xxx ) and 3 open-label studies were analyzed
for the prestudy prevalence and the incidence of reported flares of anterior uveitis.
results. a total of 717 patients who received
treatment for anterior uveitis during the course of
published clinical studies were identified by a systematic literature search using medline. followup information on the course of anterior uveitis was available for
397 patients. of these, 297 were exposed to etanercept
and 90 were exposed to  xxxd2355xxx  for a total of 430 and
146.4 years, respectively. among 190 patients who received placebo, the overall exposure was 70.5 years. the
frequency of flares of anterior uveitis in the placebo
group was 15.6 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence
interval 7.8–27.9), while the patients treated with antitnf agents had a mean of only 6.8 anterior uveitis
flares per 100 patient-years (p ⴝ 0.01). flares of
anterior uveitis occurred less frequently (although not
significantly) in patients treated with  xxxd2355xxx  than in
patients treated with etanercept (3.4 per 100 patientyears and 7.9 per 100 patient-years, respectively).
conclusion. treatment of as patients with bio-

 xxxg1055xxx  (as) is a frequently occurring chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease that causes
inflammation at diverse sites, such as the spine, peripheral joints, and entheses. the most frequently occurring extraspinal involvement is inflammation of the uvea.
in fact, the prevalences reported for anterior uveitis in
patients with as range from 30% to 40% (1). tumor
necrosis factor ␣ (tnf␣) is believed to play a major role
in the pathogenesis of as and other spondylarthritides.
treatment strategies involving anti-tnf agents have
recently proven rather successful (2–4). both  xxxd2355xxx 
and etanercept have been approved for the treatment of
patients with active as, both in europe and in the us.
based on data from trials of  xxxd2355xxx  and etanercept, it
became clear that the main symptoms of as, i.e.,
inflammatory back pain, peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis, are highly responsive to this therapy. however,
the data for anterior uveitis are less clear.
the aim of this study was to analyze the cumulative recent experience in terms of the incidence of
anterior uveitis among patients with as who were
treated with anti-tnf agents and placebo.

patients and methods
although the total number of published reports of
controlled trials with anti-tnf␣ agents is already quite substantial, the number of reports that describe the history of
anterior uveitis or the incidence of flares during treatment is
small. we performed a systematic pubmed search to identify
all articles on this topic published up to october 10, 2004. the
search terms used were as follows:  xxxg1055xxx ,

 xxxd2355xxx , etanercept, and incidence and prevalence of anterior uveitis. in addition, information from 2 studies was
available on the basis of co-authorship (4,5). no other data
were obtained from investigators or pharmaceutical companies.
information was collected on the number of patients
included in the studies; the number of cases in which a history
of anterior uveitis was reported; the cumulative exposure time
to  xxxd2355xxx , etanercept, or placebo; the incidence of anterior
uveitis flares in the treatment groups during the placebocontrolled phases; and the number of flares of anterior uveitis
that occurred during the open-label phase of the studies. all
data were analyzed for the different phases of the studies.
anterior uveitis was usually defined in the studies as “as
diagnosed by an ophthalmologist.”
the number of flares of anterior uveitis depends on the
time period of observation (exposure time). for subjects who
completed the trials, these exposure times were obtained from
the data in the original publications (2–4,6–9). the exposure
time for the subjects who withdrew was calculated by using the
published data (2,3,6,8) or by estimation, using the mean of the
time period during which the withdrawal occurred (4,9). the
total exposure time was calculated by summing the observation
times for every patient into person-years of followup. the
number of flares that occurred during exposure to both drugs
was related to the corresponding total number of available
person-years of followup.
fisher’s exact test was applied to compare the proportions of patients who experienced a flare of anterior uveitis.
exact poisson fiducial confidence limits were calculated for the
anterior uveitis rates per 100 patient-years.

results
overall, 14 references that matched the search
for the prevalence and incidence of anterior uveitis in
as patients were identified by a pubmed search. seven

clinical trials included useful data on the history of
anterior uveitis (5–11) (n ⫽ 717 patients). in 4 of these
studies (6–9), followup data on the incidence of anterior
uveitis (n ⫽ 397 patients) were additionally available.
history of anterior uveitis. the reported prevalence of anterior uveitis before the treatment period of
the trial was higher among patients who received  xxxd2355xxx  (35.6%; 146 of 410 patients) compared with the
prevalence among patients who received etanercept
(29.3%; 90 of 307 patients) (p ⫽ 0.08). the reported
prevalences of anterior uveitis are presented in table 1.
for all studies combined, a history of anterior uveitis
was reported in 236 (32.9%) of 717 patients (95%
confidence interval [95% ci] 29.5–36.5). in studies with
available followup data, a history of anterior uveitis was
reported in 127 (32.0%) of 397 patients (95% ci 27.4–

treated with etanercept for a cumulative exposure time
of 430 years.
among patients treated with  xxxd2355xxx , the incidence of anterior uveitis flares was 3.4 per 100 patientyears (95% ci 1.1–8.0). in comparison, among patients
treated with etanercept, the incidence of anterior uveitis
flares was 7.9 per 100 patient-years (95% ci 5.5–11.1)
(table 2).
the difference between the incidence of anterior
uveitis flares during placebo treatment and the incidence
during treatment with anti-tnf␣ agents was significant
(p ⫽ 0.01). this trend was somewhat stronger for
 xxxd2355xxx  (p ⫽ 0.005) than for etanercept (p ⫽ 0.05).
however, the differences between  xxxd2355xxx  and etanercept did not reach statistical significance (p ⫽ 0.08).
discussion
this study shows that anti-tnf therapy prevents
flares of anterior uveitis in a clinically relevant number
of patients with severe as. this positive effect of
anti-tnf therapy on the incidence of flares of anterior

uveitis could be shown for the currently available agents,
 xxxd2355xxx  and etanercept, while data on adalimumab
are still lacking. because the patient numbers in the
individual trials were too small to allow valuable conclusions to be reached, a combined analysis of all studies
was necessary.
in comparison with the numbers reported in
previous trials, the incidence of flares of anterior uveitis
was reduced in those trials with anti-tnf agents in
which data on eye involvement were available. the
incidence of anterior uveitis in the trials with  xxxd2355xxx 
was as low  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx .4 per 100 patient-years. although the
direct comparison of  xxxd2355xxx  with etanercept did not
reveal a statistically significant difference, it must be
taken into account that in the etanercept studies, the
prestudy prevalence of anterior uveitis was relatively
low. this difference most probably can be explained only
by chance, because the inclusion criteria in the studies
were similar. however, it is possible that the allowance
of  xxxd3255xxx , methotrexate, and corticosteroid treatment in some trials with etanercept (4), but not in those

2450

with  xxxd2355xxx  (5,8), may have influenced that difference. at least for  xxxd3255xxx , a preventive effect on
flares of anterior uveitis has been shown (12).
nevertheless, based on the data presented here,
the value of anti-tnf therapy for the prevention of
anterior uveitis in patients with as seems to be proven.
this was recently indicated in a brief report on patients
with as who were receiving etanercept (13). however, it
must be stressed that clearly not all patients in the
studies have had benefit in terms of anterior uveitis,
because a small number of patients did have a flare of
anterior uveitis. no information is available regarding
whether the severity of the flares differed and whether
these flares represented new onset or relapses of anterior uveitis. there is also no information on the correlation between the efficacy of anti-tnf therapy on
spinal symptoms and uveitis.
there was no major difference in the incidence of
anterior uveitis in the early phases of the studies compared with the later periods, in the open extension phase
(data not shown). because after several months, the
number of withdrawals from trials increases steadily, in
the patients treated with  xxxd2355xxx  (7,8) somewhat more
frequently than in the patients treated with etanercept
(4,6), it is possible that the calculated proportion of
patients with a flare was falsely low because patients who
were prone to experiencing a flare had already dropped
out of the study.
overall, the prevalence of anterior uveitis reported for the pretreatment periods of the studies was
similar to the prevalence reported in the periodical
literature (1) and in textbooks, with a range of 30–40%
of patients with as. because of the weak association
between disease severity and reported flares of anterior
uveitis (14), the prevalence in the studies could have
been even higher, but this apparently was not the case.
in future studies, it will be interesting to examine the
clinical severity of anterior uveitis in relation to both the
prevalence and the incidence, as well as in relation to the
efficacy of treatment, of anterior uveitis in patients with
rheumatic manifestations, as compared with patients
with anterior uveitis without concomitant rheumatic
symptoms.
there is some evidence from open-label studies
that  xxxd2355xxx  is effective for the treatment of posterior
uveitis in patients with behçet’s disease (15) and in
treatment-resistant active uveitis in other patients (16).
the reported efficacy of etanercept in children with
active uveitis (17) was not confirmed in a recent controlled study (18). in contrast to such severe cases, in

braun et al

which uveitis often leads to compromised vision, the
anterior uveitis associated with as and hla–b27 is
mostly unilateral and rather transient and mild in the
majority of cases (15,19). however, some cases of severe
anterior uveitis have been successfully treated with
 xxxd2355xxx  (20). more study is needed to define the role
of anti-tnf agents in the treatment of severe anterior
uveitis.
