aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic agent:  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist.  it is obvious that da is an important neurotransmitter in vivo. it is involved in a variety of physiological processes such as mental processes, motor function and hormone regulation. in this context, it is quite understandable that a da  xxxg656xxx  antagonist that inhibits the da  xxxg656xxx  regardless of the state of activity of dopaminergic neurotransmission and inhibit the physiological function of da can have a variety of adverse effects. in contrast to da d2 antagonists, aripiprazole acts as an antagonist at the da  xxxg656xxx  in the state of excessive dopaminergic neurotransmission, while it acts as an agonist at the da  xxxg656xxx  in the state of low dopaminergic neurotransmission, and thus attempts to bring the state of dopaminergic neurotransmission to normal. this activity of aripiprazole to regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission is physiologically reasonable, and can be regarded as a stabilizing effect, for which aripiprazole is called a dopamine system stabilizer.
