 xxxd2421xxx  is a strong opioid analgesic, structurally related to pethidine, which has been in clinical use for more
than forty years. in the scandinavian countries  xxxd2421xxx  is only available in combination with a spasmolytic
substance n,n-dimethyl-3,3-diphenyl-i-methylallylamine
(a29). despite its widespread use, to date only one study
has explored the opioid receptor binding of  xxxd2421xxx 
(ensinger et al. 1984). it has been performed with ligands
for p & k which are not highly selective. i therefore decided
to study the binding affinity of  xxxd2421xxx  in comparison
with morphine to p, 6 & k opioid receptors using highly
selective ligands in a p2 preparation from bovine caudate
nucleus. this model contains about 64% p, 23% 6 & 13%
k opioid receptors (christensen & reiff 1991).
bovine brains were placed on ice within minutes after the
slaughter. the caudate nuclei were dissected and homogenized in 20 vol. of 0.32 m sucrose. the homogenate
was centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 min. the pellet was
resuspended in 10 vol. of 0.05 m tris-hci buffer, ph 7.4
and stored at -80" until use. for inhibition studies the
synaptic membrane fraction was incubated with either [3h]dago (1 nm), [3h]-dpdpe(1 nm) or [3h]-u69593(2nm)
and 6-8 different concentrations of either  xxxd2421xxx  or
morphine as previously described (christensen & reiff
1991). in brief, the experiments were performed in a reaction
mixture (550 pl) containing 0.05 m tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4.
incubations at 37" were of 15 min. duration. the reaction
was stopped by immersion into an ice bath and subsequent
filtration through whatman g f / c filters followed by washing of the filters with iced incubation buffer. filters were
shaken thoroughly in vials with 10 ml filter counttmbefore
[3h]-counting. specific binding was defined with naloxone
2 x lo-' m (p & k) or 2 x
m (6). the ic50 values were
obtained by log-probit analysis and the ki values were
calculated from ki = ic50/( 1 + [l]/kd) where [l] is the concentration of labelled ligand and kd its equilibrium dissociation constant (cheng & prusoff 1973). the kd of rh]dago was determined by saturation experiments using 68 concentrations of ligand (0-17 nm). the protein content

was measured by the method of lowry using bovine serum
albumin as standard (lowry et al. 1951). the protein content in the incubation tubes were about 1 mg. the kd values
of [3h]-dpdpe and [3h]-u695932.6 & 1.6 nm originate
from a previous publication (christensen & reiff 1991).

[3h]-dago([d-ala2,me-phe4,glyol5]enkephalin,p-agonist),['h]-dpdpe( [d-penicillamine2,d-penicillamine5]enkephalin, 6-agonist) and [3h]-u69593, (k-agonist) were obtained from amersham (buckinghamshire, england).
naloxone was supplied by endo laboratories inc., garden
city, new york, u.s.a., morphine hydrochloride by the
pharmacy, rigshospitalet, copenhagen, and  xxxd2421xxx 
hydrochloride by lundbeck pharma ais, copenhagen,
denmark.
all values reported are means k s.d. differences were
tested for significance using a stundent's t-test.
in saturation binding studies [3h]-dag0 apparently
bound to a single site as suggested by linear scatchard
plots. the kd was 1.15k0.09 nm and the binding capacity
(bmax) 135k4.8 fmol/mg protein (table 1). the results of
inhibition studies are presented in table 2. it appears that
the affinity of  xxxd2421xxx  to the preceptor is significantly lower than that of morphine considering ki values of
5.5 k0.4 and 2.4k0.2 respectively. at the &binding site the
two opioids have equal affinity (ki values 143 versus 136
nm), whereas  xxxd2421xxx  has much lower affinity than
morphine to the k-receptor (ki 599 versus 130 nm). the
ratio kik/kip for  xxxd2421xxx  and morphine is 109 and
54 respectively, which means that  xxxd2421xxx  discriminates better between p & k sites than morphine. however,
 xxxd2421xxx  is less p / 6 binding selective than morphine

(ratios kis/kip 26 and 57). our results concerning the p i
selectivity of  xxxd2421xxx  are in agreement with the
findings of ensinger et al. (1984). using [3h]- xxxd1888xxx  and [3h]-ethylketocyclozocineas p- and k-ligands in
rat brain membranes they found p and k ki values for
 xxxd2421xxx  of 1.1 and 140 nm respectively.
it is uncertain whether the different receptor profiles of
 xxxd2421xxx  and morphine imply different occurrence of
side effects. only few controlled clinical trials have studied
this issue. wolf et al. (1988) have compared the effect of
a29 (ketogana) and morphine in analketobemidone
gesic treatment of acute myocardial infarction. they found
no significant difference in the occurrence of nausea and
vomiting. morphine produced greater reduction of systolic
blood pressure than ketogans, but the effect of both drugs
on pulse rate and respiration was the same. in a recent
comparison between  xxxd2421xxx , morphine and meperidine in continuous intravenous infusion for postoperative
pain relief no significant differences were demonstrated between the three analgesics with regard to nausea, vomiting
and shivering (ohqvist et al. 1991). it is probable that the
different receptor selectivity of  xxxd2421xxx  and morphine
plays a significant role in chronic high-dose treatment, but
this important matter has not been examined in controlled
trials. in spite of a relatively low p-receptor affinity ketok

+

bemidone has a higher analgesic potency than morphine by
systemic administration. it is probably due to its higher
lipophilicity and consequently more easy penetration into
the cns (herz & teschemacher 1971). thus it is to be
expected that the undersirable effects on peripheral organs
(e.g. constipation) is less pronounced with  xxxd2421xxx 
than with morphine.
in summary  xxxd2421xxx  discriminates better between
p and k sites than does morphine, but it is less p / h binding
selective,
