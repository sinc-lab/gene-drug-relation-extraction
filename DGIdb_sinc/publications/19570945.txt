abstract
drug-induced valvular heart disease (vhd) is a serious side
effect of a few medications, including some that are on the
market. pharmacological studies of vhd-associated medications (e.g., fenfluramine, pergolide,  xxxd2621xxx , and  xxxd400xxx ) have revealed that they and/or their metabolites are
potent 5-hydroxytryptamine2b (5-ht2b) receptor agonists. we
have shown that activation of 5-ht2b receptors on human heart
valve interstitial cells in vitro induces a proliferative response
reminiscent of the fibrosis that typifies vhd. to identify current
or future drugs that might induce vhd, we screened approximately 2200 u.s. food and drug administration (fda)approved or investigational medications to identify 5-ht2b
receptor agonists, using calcium-based high-throughput screening. of these 2200 compounds, 27 were  xxxg1114xxx  agonists

(hits); 14 of these had previously been identified as  xxxg1114xxx  agonists, including seven bona fide valvulopathogens. six of
the hits (guanfacine, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx , oxymetazoline,
 xxxd2097xxx , and  xxxd3145xxx ) are approved medications. twentythree of the hits were then “functionally profiled” (i.e., assayed in
parallel for  xxxg1114xxx  agonism using multiple readouts to
test for functional selectivity). in these assays, the known valvulopathogens were efficacious at concentrations as low as 30 nm,
whereas the other compounds were less so. hierarchical clustering analysis of the pec50 data revealed that  xxxd3145xxx  (which is not
associated with valvulopathy) was clearly segregated from known
valvulopathogens. taken together, our data demonstrate that patterns of  xxxg1114xxx  functional selectivity might be useful for
identifying compounds likely to induce valvular heart disease.

in 1997, the anorexigen fenfluramine was voluntarily withdrawn from the u.s. market because of its association with
valvular heart disease (vhd) and pulmonary hypertension
(connolly et al., 1997). valve tissue obtained from affected
persons revealed plaques of proliferating myofibroblasts beneath the elastic surface of the valves (steffee et al., 1999). as
lesions develop, valve function becomes impaired and valvular
insufficiency ensues. indistinguishable histopathologic results

functional profiling of 5-ht2b agonists

materials and methods
plasmid construct and cell lines. cells stably expressing
human 5-ht2b receptors were generated using the flpin system

(invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca). in brief, a cdna for the human
 xxxg1114xxx  was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from
pusf-5-ht2b (setola et al., 2005) using 5⬘ and 3⬘ bamhi linkers,
and then subcloned into the bamhi site of pcdna5.0/frt to produce
pflpin-5-ht2b. next, subconfluent (60%) flpin hek293 cells in
10-cm dishes were cotransfected with 3 ␮g of pflpin-5-ht2b and 3 ␮g
of pog5 (bearing the frt recombinase; invitrogen corp.) using 30 ␮l
of fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche applied science, indianapolis, in). twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split
1:5 into growth/selection medium (dmem, 10% fbs, 500 mg/liter
 xxxg418xxx , and 50 mg/liter hygromycin b; all from invitrogen) and allowed to expand. after selection, multiple aliquots of cells at passage
0 were collected, frozen in cell recovery medium (invitrogen) overnight at ⫺80 degrees c, then stored in liquid nitrogen. receptor
expression was verified by 1) radioligand competition binding assays
using [3h] xxxd2527xxx  (⬃1 nm final; perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences, waltham, ma) to label 5-ht2b receptors and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand (spanning at
least 5 orders of magnitude) to compete for radioligand binding
(setola et al., 2005) and 2) calcium flux assays (see calcium flux
assay) using varying concentrations of 5-ht and bw 723c86 to
measure  xxxg1114xxx  activation. cells were passaged fewer than
10 times beyond passage 0 to ensure stable  xxxg1114xxx  expression. the geneblazer cell line (cho-nfat-bla) stably expressing
human 5-ht2b receptors was from invitrogen (madison, wi) and was
maintained and prepared for assay exactly as described by the
manufacturer.
calcium flux assay. flpin hek239 5-ht2b cells were seeded in
384-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well in dmem containing
1% dialyzed fbs 24 h before the calcium flux assay. the next day,
the cells were incubated (20 ␮l/well) for 1 h at 37°c with calcium
plus dye (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca) reconstituted in
flipr buffer (hanks’  xxxd2988xxx , 2.5 mm probenecid,
and 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4) (15 ml buffer/bottle of lyophilized dye
yielded a 30⫻ dye stock). after the dye load, cells were placed in a
fliprtetra fluorescence imaging plate reader (molecular dynamics); drug dilutions, prepared at 2⫻ final concentration in flipr
buffer and aliquotted into 384-well plates, were also added to
the fliprtetra. the fluidics module and plate reader of the
fliprtetra were programmed to read baseline fluorescence for 10 s
(1 read/s), then to add 20 ␮l of drug/well and to read for 6 min
(1 read/s). fluorescence in each well was normalized to the average
of the first 10 reads (i.e., baseline fluorescence). then, the maximum
-fold increase, which occurred within 2 to 3 s after drug addition, over
baseline fluorescence elicited by vehicle or drug was determined and
plotted as a function of drug concentration. the data were analyzed
by regression against a three-parameter logistic equation (prism ver.
4.0; graphpad software, san diego, ca), with the “bottom” shared
for all samples in a plate. finally, the data were normalized such
that the baseline fluorescence was set to 0% and the emax for 5-ht
(measured on each plate) was set to 100%.
transcription factor activation assay. the activation of the
transcription factor nfat was measured using the geneblazer
 xxxg1114xxx -nfat-bla cho-k1 cell-based assay (invitrogen corp.), as
specified by the manufacturer. in brief, cells were seeded in polylysine–coated 96-well plates at approximately 3 ⫻ 104 cells/well 1
day before assay in nfat-bla assay medium (dmem, 1% dialyzed
fbs, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 25 mm hepes, ph 7.3).
on the day of the assay, dilutions of test compounds and reference
compounds (prepared at 5⫻ final concentration in pbs) were added
to the cells, and plates were incubated for 4 h at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co2. next, the nfat-␤-lactamase (bla) fret substrate was added to the cells and followed by 2-h incubation at room
temperature in the dark. cleavage of the substrate by bla results in
the loss of fret activity. samples were excited at 409 nm and
fluorescence was read from the bottom of the plates on a flexstation
ii plate reader (molecular dynamics) at 460 nm (donor fluorescence)
and 530 nm (fret fluorescence). the ratio of the two fluorescence

occur in patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome and in
persons undergoing therapy with certain ergots and ergolines
for migraines (e.g.,  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine) or parkinson’s
disease [e.g., pergolide,  xxxd400xxx  (connolly et al., 1997;
pritchett et al., 2002; horvath et al., 2004; roth, 2007)].
we and others have identified the  xxxg1114xxx  as a
likely molecular target for drug-induced vhd based on the
preferentially potent agonism of norfenfluramine (fenfluramine’s active metabolite),  xxxd2621xxx , and methylergonovine (the active metabolite of ergotamine) at human cloned
5-ht2b receptors (fitzgerald et al., 2000; rothman et al.,
2000; setola et al., 2003). additional evidence implicating
5-ht2b receptors in drug-induced vhd came from the observations that 1) 5-ht2b receptors are enriched in heart valve
tissue from various species (fitzgerald et al., 2000; setola
et al., 2003; elangbam et al., 2005; regard et al., 2008);
2) activation of human valvular interstitial 5-ht2b receptors
is mitogenic, resulting in  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and
[3h] xxxd3364xxx  incorporation (setola et al., 2003); 3) 5ht2b receptor activation has been implicated in 5-htinduced valvulopathy in experimental animals (elangbam et
al., 2008); and 4) other drugs with potent 5-ht2b agonist
activity [pergolide,  xxxd400xxx , mdma, 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine (setola et al., 2003)] induce valvular heart disease
in humans (droogmans et al., 2007; schade et al., 2007;
zanettini et al., 2007), whereas chemically similar drugs
lacking 5-ht2b agonism [e.g.,  xxxd2498xxx  and bromocriptine
(roth, 2007; berger et al., 2009)] are not associated with an
increased risk of vhd (schade et al., 2007; zanettini et al.,
2007).
given the strong associations between 5-ht2b agonism
and drug-induced vhd, we sought first to identify medications (either approved or investigational) that might induce
vhd. second, we attempted to determine which signal transduction pathway might be correlated with a drug’s propensity to induce valvulopathy. to achieve the first goal, we
screened a composite library of approximately 2200 approved
or investigational medications and drug-like scaffolds for
 xxxg1114xxx  agonism using a high-throughput, calcium
flux-based assay done on cells stably expressing exogenous
human 5-ht2b receptors. subsequently, we measured the
activity of the bona fide agonists using five additional readouts of  xxxg1114xxx  activation: nuclear factor of activated
t cells (nfat)-mediated transcription of a ␤-lactamase reporter gene,  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation, ␤-arrestin recruitment
to agonist-occupied 5-ht2b receptors, accumulation of inositol phosphates (insp), and cell proliferation. we reasoned
that the valvulopathogens might share a pattern of functional selectivity (urban et al., 2007) distinct from the non–
vhd-associated medication  xxxd3145xxx  and/or other 5-ht2b
receptor agonists.
less than 1% of the compounds screened were 5-ht2b
receptor agonists. because the identification of  xxxg1114xxx  agonists is relatively straightforward, we suggest that
current and candidate drugs be screened for 5-ht2b agonism
before clinical trials and that the clinical use of 5-ht2b
agonist medications be avoided when possible.

sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (complete edta-free
protease cocktail; roche applied science), ph 7.5] for 15 min at 4°c.
cells were scraped off plates, and the supernatants were collected
after centrifugation. a bradford protein assay (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) was performed to determine the protein concentration of each lysate (bradford, 1976). samples were diluted to
equal concentrations in sample buffer containing sds, heated, and
separated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by
transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. blots were blocked
in 3% bsa and probed for perk with a rabbit anti-perk antibody
(cell signaling technology, danvers, ma) at a 1:1000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:1000; vector
laboratories, burlingame, ca), and detection as detailed previously
(sheffler et al., 2006). blots were then stripped in stripping buffer
containing 100 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx  and 2% sds and reprobed for
total erk using a rabbit anti-erk antibody (cell signaling technology) at 1:1000, followed by secondary antibody and detection as
above. blots were imaged on a kodak gel logic 2200 (carestream
health, rochester, ny) imager and the bands quantified by densitometry using imagej software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
insp accumulation assay. measurements of insp accumulation
in agonist-stimulated flpin hek293 5-ht2b cells were made using
the scintillation proximity assay method (bourdon et al., 2006;
jensen et al., 2008). in brief, 3 ⫻ 104 cells/well were plated into
96-well tissue culture plates in dialyzed culture medium. the cells
were inositol-starved for 1.5 h and then incubated for 18 h at 37°c
with labeling medium [inositol-free basal media eagle’s solution]
(lonza walkersville, inc., walkersville, md) with 5% dialyzed fbs
and 0.01 ␮ci/ml [myo-3h]inositol (perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences)]. labeling medium was removed and agonists [dissolved in
dmso and diluted in assay buffer (1⫻ hanks’  xxxd2988xxx ,
24 mm nahco3, 11 mm glucose, and 35 mm licl, ph 7.4)] were
added to the cells for 1 h at 37°c. the assay was terminated by
replacement of the incubation medium with 40 ␮l of 50 mm formic
acid. after a 20-min incubation in  xxxd2154xxx  to extract the cytosolic
fraction from the cells, the  xxxd2154xxx  was incubated with 0.2 mg of
yttrium silicate beads (ge healthcare, chalfont st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk). radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting using a wallac microbeta trilux plate reader (perkinelmer life
and analytical sciences). insp levels (in disintegrations per minute)
were analyzed as above for ca2⫹ flux assays. finally, the data were
normalized such that the shared baseline was set to 0% and the emax
for 5-ht (measured on each plate) was set to 100%.
tetrazolium salt-based cell proliferation assay. cell proliferation was assessed using the xtt cell proliferation assay (roche
applied science) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
stable flpin hek293-5-ht2b cells or the parental flpin hek293
cells were seeded into poly-l-lysine–coated 96-well plates at density
of 3 ⫻ 104 cells/well and grown for 16 h in dmem containing 1%
serum (37°c, 5% co2). cells were then exposed to various concentrations of test or reference compounds for 48 h. during the final 4 h
of treatment, 50 ␮l of xtt tetrazolium salt reagent was added to
each well, and incubation was continued at 37°c. metabolic mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity of the cells converts the tetrazolium salt to a water-soluble formazan dye product, providing a colorimetric index proportional to cell number. the formazan dye
absorbance peak at 490 nm was measured using a spectramax
microplate reader (molecular dynamics). the absorbances obtained
were normalized to the values of untreated cells and expressed as a
percentage.
statistics. data were analyzed for statistical significance by twoway analysis of variance followed by a bonferroni post test using
prism 4.0. a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
cluster analysis. for hierarchical clustering analysis, pec50
data (expressed as pec50 ⫺ 5) were clustered using genecluster
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genecluster2/
 xxxg2121xxx .html) with “assays” and “drugs” representing the two axes. the
similarity matrix used was produced via the correlation (uncentered)

values (460 nm/530 nm) was calculated for each sample. these fret
ratios were analyzed as above for ca2⫹ flux assays. the data were
then normalized so that the shared baseline was set to 0%, and the
emax for 5-ht (measured on each plate) was set to 100%.
arrestin translocation assay. arrestin recruitment to ligand
activated 5-ht2b receptors was carried out using tango  xxxg1114xxx -bla
u2os cell line (invitrogen). these cells stably express c-terminally
modified  xxxg1114xxx , protease-tagged ␤-arrestin, and ␤-lactamase reporter gene. arrestin recruited to the activated receptors was
measured by the amount of ␤-lactamase activity. the cells were
plated in 384-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well in 32 ␮l of
assay medium (dmem supplemented with 1% dialyzed fbs, 25 mm
hepes buffer, ph 7.3, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm
sodium pyruvate). the cells were stimulated with indicated concentration of the test compounds or reference compound. after overnight
incubation in a humidified incubator at 37°c with 5% co2, the cells
were loaded with cell-permeable liveblazer fret b/g substrate
(invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. fret emission ratios were
obtained on a tecan infinite 200 fluorescence plate reader (excitation
at 409 nm, emission 450 nm and 525 nm). the ratio of two fluorescence
values (450 nm/525 nm) was calculated for each sample. the data were
analyzed as described above for transcription factor activation assay.
 xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation assay. the gfp- xxxg1366xxx  expression vector
was generated by gateway cloning technology. entry clone ioh12327
(invitrogen) encoding  xxxg1366xxx  was recombined with a plenti-bsd destination vector modified with an n-terminal emgfp tag. using the
resulting plentiemgfp- xxxg1366xxx  construct, lentivirus was generated using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (invitrogen). geneblazer  xxxg1114xxx -nfat-bla cho-k1 cells were then transduced with
lentivirus and placed under blasticidin selection. blasicidin-resistant
clonal populations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using gfp fluorescence as a sorting marker. geneblazer
 xxxg1114xxx -nfat-bla cho-k1 gfp- xxxg1366xxx  cells were seeded in white
384-well flat-bottomed cell culture-treated plates (corning life sciences, acton, ma) at densities of approximately 2 ⫻ 104 cells/well in
32 ␮l of assay medium (consisting of 99% opti-mem, supplemented
with 0.1% charcoal/dextran-treated fbs, 100 u/ml penicillin, and
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm
sodium pyruvate, 25 mm hepes ph 7.3, and lacking phenol red). all
media reagents were obtained from invitrogen. after an overnight
serum-starvation, the cells were exposed to 4 ␮l of antagonist or 1%
dmso (vehicle) for 10 min. then, 4 ␮l of serial-diluted test compound was added to each well simultaneously using a hamamatsu
functional drug screening system instrument (hamamatsu city, japan). immediately after a 6-min stimulation at room temperature,
cell medium was removed by inverting the plate onto a dry paper
towel. cells were then lysed by addition of 20 ␮l of lysis buffer/well
(consisting of 2 nm terbium-anti- xxxg1366xxx  [pthr/ptyr 185/187] antibody (invitrogen), 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 1% nonidet p-40, 5 mm
edta, 5 mm naf, 150 mm nacl, and 1:100 of protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails; sigma, st. louis, mo). after allowing the
assay to equilibrate for 2 h at room temperature, time-resolved
fret emission ratios were determined on a bmg pherastar fluorescence plate reader (bmg labtech, durham, nc) using the following settings: excitation at 340 nm, emission at 520 nm and 490 nm;
100-␮s lag time, 200-␮s integration time. emission ratios were then
calculated by dividing the 520 nm emission value by the 490 nm
emission value. data were then normalized as described above.
immunoblot analysis. flpin hek293 5-ht2b cells were plated
in dmem containing 5% dialyzed fbs. twenty-four hours later,
cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium overnight.
drugs (except 5-ht) were initially dissolved  xxxd1891xxx  mm in dmso and
then diluted in serum-free medium; 5-ht was dissolved directly in
serum-free medium. when necessary, cells were pretreated for 15
min with 1 ␮m sb 206553 before addition of agonist or vehicle.
agonists were applied at 1 ␮m for 5 min, and then cells were
immediately placed on ice, and lysed in lysis buffer [1.5% chaps, 50

results
to identify potential valvulopathogenic  xxxg1114xxx 
agonists, we compiled a small molecule library of fda-approved and investigational drugs and drug-like scaffolds.
this composite library contained the prestwick chemical
library, the national institutes of health clinical collection,
the national institute of mental health-rti international
screening set, and our own internal library (approximately
2200 compounds; see supplementary table 1, which contains
all the drugs and the initial screening results). for the initial
screen, we assayed compounds at 3 to 10 ␮m final concen-

tration for agonist activity at recombinant human 5-ht2b
receptors stably expressed in hek293 flpin cells using a
calcium flux-based flipr assay. in parallel, we also assessed compound activity in the parental hek293 flpin cells
to identify false positives. from the list of confirmed agonists
(see supplementary table 2), several compounds were chosen for further study. the selected compounds were 1) known
5-ht2b agonists, 2) vhd-associated medications and/or metabolites thereof, and/or 3) investigational compounds and
medications not previously known to activate 5-ht2b receptors (table 1).
we next generated concentration-response isotherms for
the selected, putative 5-ht2b agonists listed in table 1 to
obtain estimates of potency (pec50) and efficacy relative to
5-ht (emax) (fig. 1, table 1). it is noteworthy that the caldownloaded from molpharm.aspetjournals.org at aspet journals on april 11, 2015

cium response for each agonist was blocked by the 5-ht2b/2c
receptor-selective antagonist sb 206553 (supplementary
fig. 1). fourteen of the 27 hits were previously identified
 xxxg1114xxx  agonists [quipazine, 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine, ru 24969, sch 23390, bw723c86, doi,
way 161503, pergolide, norfenfluramine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,  xxxd400xxx ,  xxxd2021xxx , methylergonovine].
of the 14 known  xxxg1114xxx  agonists, 7 were medications (or metabolites thereof) associated with vhd (pergolide, norfenfluramine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,  xxxd400xxx ,  xxxd2021xxx , methylergonovine). the remaining 13
hits were not previously known to be  xxxg1114xxx  agonists, although some were known to be functionally active at
other 5-ht receptors (l 694247, sr 57227a, cp 132484-42,
and cp 123,479-11). skf 83566 was a known d1-like receptor-selective antagonist. six of the newly discovered 5-ht2b

receptor agonists (guanfacine, quinidine,  xxxd2097xxx ,
oxymetazoline,  xxxd3539xxx , and  xxxd3145xxx ) are currently
approved medications.
on the basis of potency and efficacy estimates in the agonist-induced calcium flux assay, the vhd-associated hits
(pergolide, norfenfluramine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,
 xxxd400xxx ,  xxxd2021xxx , and methylergonovine) could not be
clearly distinguished from  xxxd3145xxx , which is thought to be
“safe” in terms of vhd. the vhd-associated drugs  xxxd400xxx  and dihydroergotamine had potencies similar to  xxxd3145xxx  (pec50 values of 6.40 ⫾ 0.10, 5.30 ⫾ 0.22, and 5.59 ⫾
0.02, respectively) and were as efficacious (emax values of
98.5 ⫾ 1.9, 81.6 ⫾ 7.9, and 73 ⫾ 1%, respectively) (table 1).
other vhd-associated compounds, such as pergolide and
methylergonovine, were more potent (pec50 values of 7.13 ⫾
0.08 and 7.67 ⫾ 0.07, respectively) but not more efficacious

than  xxxd3145xxx  (table 1). thus, we postulated that other
readouts of  xxxg1114xxx  activation might better distinguish the vhd-associated drugs from  xxxd3145xxx , and thus
permit us to assess the valvulopathic risk of the other fdaapproved hits (guanfacine, quinidine,  xxxd2097xxx , oxymetazoline, and  xxxd3539xxx ).
we generated concentration-response isotherms using four
additional assays of  xxxg1114xxx  activity as follows: 1)
calcium-sensitive nfat-mediated transcription of a ␤-lactamase reporter gene, 2) accumulation of insps in licl-treated
cells, 3) recruitment of ␤-arrestin to agonist-occupied receptors, and 4) phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  xxxg1366xxx . in control assays, we established that
these agonist-induced responses were blocked by sb 206553,

and/or absent in parental cell lines not expressing recombinant human 5-ht2b receptors (data not shown). it is noteworthy that the time scale of the four additional assays— but
not of the calcium flux assay—permits measurement or response under equilibrium conditions of agonist-receptor
occupancy.
the ␤-lactamase (bla) assays revealed all vhd-associated
drugs to have pec50 values greater than 7.5; i.e., they had
ec50 values less than 30 nm (table 1; representative isotherms appear in fig. 2). in contrast,  xxxd3145xxx  was markedly less potent than known valvulopathogens in bla assays,
having a pec50 value of 5.0 ⫾ 0.1 (i.e., an ec50 value of 10
␮m) (table 1, fig. 2). the medications guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx , and  xxxd2097xxx  had intermediate bla pec50 values ranging from 6.91 ⫾ 0.06 to 6.00 ⫾

0.9%, respectively) (table 1).
to validate the results of the  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation assays, we performed conventional immunoblot analyses. we
focused our attention on the six currently prescribed medications (guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx ,  xxxd2097xxx , and  xxxd3145xxx ) and included 5-ht and
norfenfluramine as positive controls. at 1 ␮m after a 5-min
challenge, all drugs stimulated significant  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in serum-deprived hek293 flpin cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-ht2b receptors, as assessed
by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody (fig. 4). it is noteworthy that drug-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2
activation was blocked by the 5-ht2b/2c receptor-selective
antagonist sb 206553 (fig. 4) and was absent in parental
hek293 flpin cells (data not shown).
in ␤-arrestin recruitment assays, the known valvulopathogens were again more potent [pec50 values ranged from
8.96 ⫾ 0.02 to 6.89 ⫾ 0.05 (i.e., ec50 values between 1.1 and

0.04 (i.e., ec50 values between 123 and 1000 nm) (table 1,
fig. 2). relative efficacy measurements in bla assays did not
distinguish  xxxd3145xxx  (emax value of 89 ⫾ 6%) from the
vhd-associated compounds dihydroergotamine and methylergonovine (emax values of 92 ⫾ 1 and 56 ⫾ 2%, respectively)
(table 1).
a similar distinction between the vhd-associated drugs
and  xxxd3145xxx  was apparent in the phospho- xxxg1366xxx  assays.
the valvulopathogens all stimulated  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation
with pec50 values greater than 7.5 (i.e., ec50 values less
than 30 nm) (table 1; representative isotherms appear in
fig. 3), whereas  xxxd3145xxx  induced  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation
with a pec50 value of 5.60 ⫾ 0.05 (table 1, fig. 3). the
fda-approved drugs guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,
 xxxd3539xxx , and  xxxd2097xxx  had pec50 values for  xxxg1366xxx 
phosphorylation ranging from 8.00 ⫾ 0.04 to 6.23 ⫾ 0.03 (i.e.,
ec50 values between 10 and 589 nm) (table 1, fig. 3). the
relative efficacy of  xxxd3145xxx  at stimulating  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation (emax value of 67 ⫾ 3%) was not markedly different
from the values for the vhd-associated drugs dihydroergot-

guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx , and
 xxxd2097xxx  stimulated ␤-arrestin translocation with pec50
values ranging from 5.51 ⫾ 0.04 to 5.18 ⫾ 0.07 (i.e., ec50
values between 3100 and 6600 nm) (table 1, fig. 5). in terms
of relative efficacy, the emax value of  xxxd3145xxx  in ␤-arrestin
recruitment assays was difficult to estimate because of its
low affinity; however,  xxxd3145xxx  was at least as efficacious as
the valvuopathogen norfenfluramine (emax value of 52 ⫾ 1%)
(table 1, fig. 5). it is noteworthy that for the 23 drugs we
characterized in all five functional assays, partial agonism
(i.e., an emax value less than 80%) was markedly rarer in
␤-arrestin translocation assays (4 of 23) than in the other
assays (13 of 23 in calcium flux-based assays, 10 of 23 in bla

assays, 18 of 23 in  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation assays, and 12 of
23 in insp accumulation assays) (table 1, figs. 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 6).
as was true in the previous assays, the bona fide vhdassociated drugs also exhibited greater potencies in insp
accumulation assays [pec50 values ranged from 8.64 ⫾ 0.03
to 6.73 ⫾ 0.05 (i.e., ec50 values between 2.3 nm and 186 nm)]
than did  xxxd3145xxx  [pec50 value was 4.46 ⫾ 0.02 (i.e., an
ec50 value ⬎10 ␮m)] (table 1, fig. 6).  xxxd3145xxx  displayed
an emax of 163 ⫾ 4% in insp accumulation assays; as such, it
is more efficacious by this measure than the valvulopathogen
pergolide (emax value of 95 ⫾ 1%) (table 1, fig. 6).

nolly et al., 1997; steffee et al., 1999). the proliferative
plaques precede, and probably contribute to, valve dysfunction (roth, 2007). we showed that valvulopathogens elicit
 xxxg1114xxx -dependent proliferative responses in primary cultures of human heart valve interstitial cells, consistent with the putative actions of vhd-associated drugs in
vivo (setola et al., 2003). along these lines, we predicted that
the six currently prescribed medications we had identified as
 xxxg1114xxx  agonists, as well as the known valvulopathogens, would stimulate the proliferation of hek293 flpin
cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-ht2b receptors. in xtt-based proliferation assays, all compounds
seemed to stimulate proliferation at 1 ␮m, an effect that was
blocked by the 5-ht2b/2c receptor selective antagonist sb
206553 (fig. 7). in terms of apparent potency, 5-ht and the

719

vhd-associated drugs tested (pergolide,  xxxd400xxx , dihydroergotamine, and norfenfluramine) were all active at 30
nm in the proliferation assays (fig. 7a). furthermore, the
apparent proliferative activity at 30 nm distinguished  xxxd3145xxx  from the known valvulopathogens (fig. 7a). of the
other fda-approved medications tested, only guanfacine and
 xxxd3539xxx  were active at 30 nm, thus resembling the
valvulopathogens (fig. 7b). it is noteworthy that none of the
drugs seemed to stimulate proliferation in hek293 flpin
cells not expressing recombinant human 5-ht2b receptors
(supplemental fig. 2), ruling out a nonspecific effect (e.g., on
metabolism of the xtt colorimetric substrate).
we finally conducted hierarchical clustering analysis to
determine whether any patterns of functional activity at the
various read-outs of 5-ht2b agonism distinguish bona fide

from potential valvulopathogens. as shown in fig. 8,  xxxd3145xxx  (a drug not associated with vhd) was clearly separated
from known vhd-inducing drugs. in addition, ergoline and
ergot-like drugs associated with vhd were all clustered on
the same node. finally, norfenfluramine was clustered on a
node with 5-ht, indicating a similar pattern of functional
selectivity for these two known valvulopathogens. these results indicate that ergot and ergoline medications induce a
pattern of functional selectivity at 5-ht2b receptors that is
distinct from that induced by indoleamines and other small
molecules.

the major findings of this study are that known valvulopathic 5-ht2b agonists are distinguished by relatively high
potencies across a variety of signaling measures and that
potent  xxxg1114xxx  agonism is a relatively rare occurrence among drugs and drug-like compounds. in addition,
our results demonstrate that no single pattern of functional
selectivity (urban et al., 2007) distinguishes bona fide valvulopathic drugs from nonvalvulopathic drugs. on the other

hand, a composite analysis of the signaling data indicates
that  xxxd3145xxx  (a 5-ht2b agonist not associated with vhd)
has a distinctly different pattern of functional selectivity
compared with known vhd-inducing medications.
to arrive at these conclusions, we screened a composite
library containing three publicly available collections of
fda-approved and investigational medications and one internally compiled library (approximately 2200 compounds in
all). after removing nonspecific “agonists” (false positives)
from the initial hit list, 27 bona fide  xxxg1114xxx  agonists
remained; thus, the validated hit rate was 1.2%. among the
hits identified in our blinded screen were 1) previously identified  xxxg1114xxx  agonists used in preclinical biomedical
research (e.g., bw 723c86, doi, way 161503) and 2) all
seven vhd-associated medications/metabolites in the composite library (pergolide, norfenfluramine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,  xxxd400xxx ,  xxxd2021xxx , and methylergonovine), all of which are reported  xxxg1114xxx  agonists
(fitzgerald et al., 2000; rothman et al., 2000; setola et al.,
2003). these findings validate our screening strategy.
another major finding is the identification of six currently
prescribed medications (guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx ,  xxxd2097xxx , and  xxxd3145xxx ) as 5-ht2b
receptor agonists. it is noteworthy that, in 2003, we discovered that mdma, its metabolite 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, and pergolide were potent  xxxg1114xxx  agonists,

functional profiling of 5-ht2b agonists

associated drugs is an important determinant of valvulopathic risk (connolly et al., 1997; roth, 2007; schade et al.,
2007), the short-term use of  xxxd3539xxx  and oxymetazoline (nasal decongestants) and the one-time use of  xxxd2097xxx  (antihypertensive agent used postoperatively and inhospital during hypertensive crisis) may not be as risky.
in conclusion, we report that  xxxg1114xxx  agonism is
rare among drugs and drug-like compounds. in addition, we
provide evidence that  xxxg1114xxx  agonist potency in
several functional assays might afford a means for separating compounds likely to induce vhd in humans from those
that are not. based on our data, we suggest that calcium
flux-based screening is well suited to the initial identification
of  xxxg1114xxx  agonists but not to the discrimination of
ones that might induce vhd from ones that are unlikely to do
so. hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a clear separation between  xxxd3145xxx  (which is not known to induce vhd)
and other known valvuopathogens when a multiplicity of
functional readouts was considered. finally, our results suggest that parallel studies of the in vitro pharmacology and
the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine and quinidine and their
metabolites are warranted.

and that these drugs stimulated heart valve cell proliferation
in vitro (setola et al., 2003). thus, we predicted that mdma
and pergolide use might be associated with vhd—predictions that were validated in 2007 (droogmans et al., 2007;
roth, 2007; schade et al., 2007; zanettini et al., 2007). therefore, there is precedent for predicting vhd liability based
solely on agonist activity at recombinant 5-ht2b receptors.
in this regard, it is noteworthy that  xxxd3145xxx , which is
approved for treating parkinson’s disease and restless legs
syndrome, seems not to induce vhd. if one assumes that
 xxxd3145xxx  is “safe” with respect to valvulopathy, then what
additional factor(s) distinguish vhd-associated  xxxg1114xxx  agonists from  xxxg1114xxx  agonists?
the present results suggest that  xxxd3145xxx  is distinct from
the seven known valvulopathic  xxxg1114xxx  agonists we
studied in that it is much less potent, albeit not less efficacious, than the vhd-associated drugs in all but one of the
 xxxg1114xxx  functional assays employed. in bla assays,
 xxxd3145xxx  was 526-fold less potent than the least potent
vhd-associated drug (pergolide); in  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation
assays,  xxxd3145xxx  was 631-fold less potent than the least
potent valvulopathogen ( xxxd400xxx ); in ␤-arrestin recruitment assays,  xxxd3145xxx  was 77-fold less potent than the least
potent vhd-inducing compound (norfenfluramine); finally,
in insp accumulation assays,  xxxd3145xxx  was 301-fold less
potent than the least potent valvulopathic compound (pergolide) (table 1). in cell proliferation assays, all vhd-associated
drugs elicited a robust response (in terms of the maximum
measured 5-ht response) at 30 nm;  xxxd3145xxx  was active
only at 1 ␮m but not at 30 nm (fig. 7a). in none of the assays
was there a clear distinction between  xxxd3145xxx ’s relative
efficacy and the relative efficacies of the vhd-associated
drugs. it is not surprising that hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a clear separation of  xxxd3145xxx  from known
vhd-inducing medications.
safety and efficacy studies are under way examining the
anorexigen lorcaserin, a 5-ht2c/2b receptor full agonist with
a reported 100-fold selectivity for 5-ht2c receptors over
5-ht2b receptors in vitro (thomsen et al., 2008). in terms of
vhd risk, the results seem promising: after 12 weeks, daily
lorcaserin use did not seem to have fenfluramine-like valvulopathic liability (smith et al., 2009). one possible explanation for the apparent safety of lorcaserin is its biodistribution; in rodents, levels of lorcaserin in the brain exceed
plasma levels by a factor of 13 (thomsen et al., 2008). assuming similar pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in humans, therapeutic doses of lorcaserin may not generate sufficiently high levels of plasma lorcaserin to activate heart
valve interstitial cell 5-ht2b receptors or other 5-ht2b receptors relevant to vhd.
in light of our present results, and our previous work
linking  xxxg1114xxx  agonists to vhd, we believe it would
be prudent for guanfacine, oxymetazoline, quinidine,  xxxd3539xxx , and  xxxd2097xxx  to be studied further in terms of
their pharmacodynamics to determine whether they are safe
with respect to vhd. of particular concern are guanfacine
(an antihypertensive agent) and quinidine (an antiarrhythmic agent), each of which is administered over sustained
periods. furthermore, given the recent fda approval of
guanfacine for the treatment of adhd, increasing numbers
of patients (and children) might be exposed to a potentially
valvulopathic agent. because duration of therapy with vhd-
