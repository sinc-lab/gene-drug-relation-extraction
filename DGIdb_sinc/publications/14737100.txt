the expression of the nh2 terminally truncated erbb2
receptor (p95erbb2) in breast cancer correlates with
metastatic disease progression compared with the expression of full-length  xxxg721xxx . we now show that heregulin
(hrg), but not egf, stimulates p95erbb2 phosphorylation
in bt474 breast cancer cells. furthermore, phosphop95erbb2 forms heterodimers with  xxxg722xxx , but not egfr,
while  xxxg721xxx  heterodimerizes with both egfr and
 xxxg722xxx . the predilection of p95erbb2 to heterodimerize with
 xxxg722xxx  provides an explanation for its regulation by hrg,
an  xxxg722xxx  ligand.  xxxd2445xxx , a reversible small molecule
inhibitor of egfr and erbb2 tyrosine kinases, inhibits
baseline p95erbb2 phosphorylation in bt474 cells and
tumor xenografts. inhibition of p95erbb2,  xxxg721xxx , and
egfr phosphorylation by  xxxd2445xxx  resulted in the
inhibition of downstream phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, phospho-akt,
and cyclin d steady-state protein levels. increased
phosphorylation of p95erbb2 and akt in response to
hrg was abrogated to varying degrees by  xxxd2445xxx . in
contrast, trastuzumab did not inhibit p95erbb2 phosphorylation or the expression of downstream phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2,
phospho-akt, or cyclin d. it is tempting to speculate that
trastuzumab resistance may be mediated in part by the
selection of p95erbb2-expressing breast cancer cells capable
of exerting potent growth and prosurvival signals through
p95erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimers. thus, p95erbb2 represents a
target for therapeutic intervention, and one that is
sensitive to  xxxd2445xxx  therapy.

introduction
the erbb2 gene encodes an mr 185 kda member of
the  xxxg682xxx  family of  xxxg1608xxx  tyrosine
kinases, whose expression in certain normal tissues plays
a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation
(sibilia and wagner, 1995; threadgill et al., 1995). in

addition, aberrant activation of erbb2 in breast and
other adenocarcinomas predicts for a poor clinical
outcome (slamon et al., 1987, 1989; gullick et al.,
1991; bacus et al., 1994). consequently, therapeutic
monoclonal antibodies or small molecules, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors targeting erbb2 and/or the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr or  xxxg682xxx ), have been
developed. for example, trastuzumab a humanized antierbb2 monoclonal antibody is approved for treating the
25–30% of breast cancers that overexpress erbb2 or
demonstrate erbb2 gene ampliﬁcation (cobleigh et al.,
1999).
the regulation of  xxxg682xxx  receptor signaling is in large
part mediated by a family of peptide ligands that bind to
and activate  xxxg682xxx  receptors, for example, epidermal
growth factor (egf) and transforming growth factor a
(tgfa) bind egfr, while heregulin (hrg) binds
 xxxg722xxx  and  xxxg723xxx  (salomon et al., 1995; reise and
stern, 1998). ligand binding induces  xxxg682xxx  receptor
phosphorylation with subsequent formation of either
receptor homo- or heterodimers. phosphorylation of
speciﬁc tyrosine residues contained within the cytoplasmic domain of  xxxg682xxx  receptors establishes docking sites
for the  xxxd1075xxx -binding domain and/or srchomology 2 (sh2) containing proteins. the activation
of these adapter proteins initiates a signaling cascade
involved in regulating cell growth and survival (luttrell
et al., 1994; levkowitz et al., 1996; tzahar et al., 1996;
olayioye et al., 1998; hackel et al., 1999; klapper et al.,
2000). erbb2 is the preferred heterodimeric partner,
potentiating  xxxg682xxx  receptor signaling (stern and kamps,
1988; ullrich and schlessinger, 1990; wada et al., 1990;
karunagaran et al., 1996; graus-porta et al., 1997).
although it lacks a peptide ligand, erbb2 is transactivated through heterodimerization.
the biological effects elicited by  xxxg682xxx  receptor
complexes vary depending upon the peptide ligands
expressed in the tumor microenvironment as well
as the cellular repertoire of  xxxg682xxx  receptors. certain
sh2 and  xxxd1075xxx -binding-domain proteins
preferentially associate with speciﬁc  xxxg682xxx  receptors.
for example,  xxxg722xxx  contains multiple cytoplasmic
docking sites for the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (pi3k), a prosurvival factor involved in
resistance to hormonal/chemotherapy (cheng et al.,

1992; prigent and gullick, 1994; soltoff et al., 1994;
bacus et al., 2002; vivanco and sawyers, 2002; yakes
et al., 2002). accordingly,  xxxg722xxx -containing heterodimers, speciﬁcally erbb2– xxxg722xxx  complexes, elicit potent
mitogenic and prosurvival signals (alimandi et al., 1995;
siegel et al., 1999).
full-length erbb2 ( xxxg721xxx ) undergoes proteolytic
cleavage, shedding its extracellular domain (ecd),
which is detectable in cell culture medium or patients’
sera (lin and clinton, 1991; zabrecky et al., 1991; pupa
et al., 1993). elevated levels of erbb2 ecd in sera of
breast cancer patients correlate with a poorer response
to therapy (kandl et al., 1994; brandt-rauf, 1995;
yamauchi et al., 1997; colomer et al., 2000). truncated
erbb2 receptor (p95erbb2) exhibits increased autokinase
activity and enhanced transforming efﬁciency compared
with  xxxg721xxx , implicating the ecd as a negative
regulator of erbb2 kinase and oncogenic activity (di
fiore et al., 1987; bargmann and weinberg, 1988;
segatto et al., 1988).
p95erbb2 expression correlates with positive lymph
node metastasis in erbb2-overexpressing breast cancers
(christianson et al., 1998; molina et al., 2002). it is
therefore tempting to speculate that enhanced signaling
through p95erbb2-containing receptor complexes plays a
role in metastatic progression. we now show that
 xxxd2445xxx , a reversible inhibitor of erbb2 and egfr
tyrosine kinases (cockerill et al., 2001), blocks p95erbb2
phosphorylation in breast cancer cell lines and tumor
xenografts, whereas trastuzumab has no effect. in
contrast to the full-length receptor, p95erbb2 almost
exclusively associates with  xxxg722xxx  compared with
egfr, providing an explanation for the activation
of p95erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  by hrg.  xxxg722xxx -p95erbb2 heterodimer formation and subsequent activation of the
pi3k-akt prosurvival pathway provide a possible
explanation for the link between p95erbb2 expression
and metastatic progression in breast cancer. the inhibition of activated p95erbb2 by  xxxd2445xxx  has clinical
implications for treating metastatic breast cancer and
early-stage tumors that express p95erbb2.

inhibition of p95 by  xxxd2445xxx  in erbb2 overexpressing
breast cell lines and its identification as the truncated
erbb2 receptor (p95erbb2)
exposure of erbb2 overexpressing bt474 breast cancer
cells to  xxxd2445xxx  (1 mm) for 16 h not only inhibited
phosphorylation of  xxxg721xxx  (figure 1, upper arrow)
but also that of a 95 kda  xxxd1075xxx  protein (p95)
(arrowhead). in addition,  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited  xxxg721xxx 
and p95 phosphorylation in s1 cells, a cell line
established by single cell cloning of hb4ac5.2 cells, a
nonmalignant mammary epithelial line stably transfected with erbb2 (xia et al., 2002). in contrast, p95 was
not identiﬁed in the egfr-overexpressing head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma line hn5 or in parental
hb4a cells, although exposure to 5 mm  xxxd2445xxx

and egfr as well as a 95-kda  xxxd1075xxx  protein (p95) in
bt474, hn5, s1, and hb4a cell lines. western blot analysis was
performed on equal amounts of protein from whole-cell extracts using
a ptyr mab. steady-state protein levels of phosphorylated  xxxg721xxx ,
p170egfr (arrows), and p95 (arrowhead) are shown. cells were treated
with vehicle alone () (dmso at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1%) or
gw572106 (1 or 5 mm as indicated for 24 h)

figure 2 identiﬁcation of p95 as the truncated erbb2 receptor
(p95erbb2). exponentially growing bt474 cells were cocultured with
0.5 mm  xxxd2445xxx  (lanes 2, 5, 8) or 10 mg/ml trastuzumab (lanes 3, 6, 9)
for 24 h. equal amounts of protein were separated by sds–page and
then erbb2, p95erbb2, ptyr/p95erbb2, and ptyr/erbb2 steady-state
protein levels assessed by western blot. blots were probed with the
following abs: (a) a erbb2 ecd (lanes 1–3), (b) a intracytoplasmic
erbb2 peptide (aa 1243–1255) (lanes 4–6), and (c) a ptyr (lanes 7–9).
controls were treated with vehicle (0.1% dmso) alone (lanes 1, 4, 7)

inhibited phosphorylation of p170egfr (lower arrow)
and  xxxg721xxx , respectively (upper arrow).
proteolytic cleavage of the ecd of  xxxg721xxx  results in
a phosphorylated, truncated 95 kda erbb2 receptor
(p95erbb2) (christianson et al., 1998). to determine if p95
and p95erbb2 are the same molecules, equal amounts of
protein from the total cell extracts were analysed by
western blot using a erbb2 mab recognizing an epitope
within the erbb2 ecd (figure 2, lanes 1–3). steadystate  xxxg721xxx  protein levels (arrow) were unchanged in
bt474 cells treated with vehicle alone (control) (lane 1),
0.5 mm  xxxd2445xxx  (lane 2), or 10 mg/ml trastuzumab
(lane 3). in contrast, p95 was not identiﬁed using this
particular mab (figure 2, lanes 1–3).
however,  xxxg721xxx  (arrow) and p95 (arrowhead) were
identiﬁed in western blots from bt474 whole-cell
extracts using a erbb2 ab recognizing peptide 1243–
1255, an intracytoplasmic erbb2 sequence distinct from
egfr or  xxxg722xxx  (figure 2, lanes 4–6). thus, p95 is the
truncated erbb2 receptor, p95erbb2. exposure to
 xxxd2445xxx  (0.5 mm) for 24 h inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of both  xxxg721xxx  and p95erbb2 in bt474 cells
(lane 8). although p95erbb2 steady-state protein levels
were somewhat reduced in trastuzumab (10 mg/ml)
treated bt474 cells (lane 6), it had no effect on p95erbb2
phosphorylation (lane 9).

cancer xenografts
we next examined the in vivo effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on
p95erbb2 in mice bearing established bt474 tumor
xenografts. as shown in figure 3a, steady-state protein
levels of total  xxxg721xxx  and p95erbb2 were unchanged in
tumor xenografts from vehicle (lanes 1–3),  xxxd2445xxx 
(lanes 4–6), or trastuzumab (lanes 7–9) treated mice.
using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody for western
blot analysis, we show that phospho- xxxg721xxx  steadystate protein levels were inhibited in bt474 tumors
isolated from  xxxd2445xxx -treated mice (100 mg/kg/dose)
(figure 3b, lanes 4–6). similarly,  xxxd2445xxx  completely
inhibited phospho-p95erbb2 steady-state protein levels
(lanes 4–6). we also examined the effect of  xxxd2445xxx 
on the phosphorylation state of tyrosine 1248 (y1248),
a key erbb2 autophosphorylation site linked to downstream mapk- xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling. using a phosphopeptide-speciﬁc antibody, we show that  xxxd2445xxx 
inhibited y1248 phosphorylation in p95erbb2 (figure 3c,
lanes 4–6), whereas trastuzumab had little effect
(lanes 7–9).

figure 4  xxxd2445xxx  blocks the activation of mapk- xxxg1369xxx /2 and
pi3k-akt pathways and reduces  xxxg366xxx /2 total steady-state
protein levels in bt474 xenografts. equal amounts of protein from
tumor xenograft whole-cell extracts from vehicle (lanes 1–3),
 xxxd2445xxx  (lanes 4–6), and trastuzumab-treated animals (lanes 7–9)
were separated by sds–page and steady-state protein levels of total
and phosphorylated forms of  xxxg1369xxx /2, and akt assessed by western
blot.  xxxg366xxx /2 steady-state protein levels were also determined.

the inhibition of  xxxg721xxx  and p95erbb2 phosphorylation by  xxxd2445xxx  in turn abrogated downstream
signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell
growth and survival.  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and
p-akt steady-state protein levels without affecting the
total steady-state protein levels of either molecule
(figure 4, lanes 4–6). in addition, cyclin d steady-state
protein levels were inhibited by  xxxd2445xxx . conversely,
trastuzumab (100 mg/kg) had little effect on p- xxxg1369xxx /2,
p-akt, or cyclin d protein (lanes 7–9). actin steadystate protein levels demonstrate equal loading of
protein.

mice. when tumors were palpable, animals were administered
 xxxd2445xxx  (lanes 4–6), trastuzumab (lanes 7–9), or vehicle alone
(lanes 1–3) (see materials and methods). (a) the total  xxxg721xxx  and
p95erbb2 steady-state protein levels were assessed by western blot using

(ptyr/p95erbb2) were assessed using a ptyr mab. (c) phosphorylated
p95erbb2 and  xxxg721xxx  were assessed using a phospho-tyrosine-speciﬁc
mab recognizing y1248
oncogene

bt474 cells also express egfr and  xxxg722xxx . to
determine whether truncated p95erbb2 forms heterodimers, whole-cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation (ip) with either a egfr, erbb2, or  xxxg722xxx 
abs followed by western blot analysis using a ptyr
mab. as shown, egf (50 ng/ml) increased egfr
phosphorylation in bt474 cells (figure 5, upper panel).
 xxxd2445xxx  (1 mm) markedly inhibited baseline egfr
phosphorylation and partially blocked that induced by
egf. in contrast, hrg had little effect on phosphorylation of egfr (upper panel). moreover, phosphop95erbb2 did not coprecipitate with egfr (upper panel).
using an ab directed against the intracytoplasmic
erbb2 peptide (1243–1255) to immunoprecipitate both
full-length and truncated receptors, we show that
 xxxd2445xxx  inhibited phosphorylation of  xxxg721xxx  and
p95erbb2 in the presence or absence of hrg and egf
(figure 5, middle panel).
importantly, p95erbb2 coimmunoprecipitated with
 xxxg722xxx  (figure 5, lower panel). hrg is an  xxxg722xxx 
ligand.  xxxg722xxx  phosphorylation increased 6.3-fold following stimulation with hrg, while phosphorylation of

16 h and then exposed to egfr (50 ng/ml) or hrg (5 mm) for 15 min

assessed by ip (as indicated in the upper, middle, and lower panels)

an odyssey infrared imaging system. these results are representative
of three independent experiments

p95erbb2 that coprecipitated with  xxxg722xxx  increased 4.5fold (figure 5, lower panel). treatment with  xxxd2445xxx 
blocked hrg-induced phosphorylation of coimmunoprecipitated p95erbb2 by 50%. in contrast, egf had no
effect on  xxxg722xxx  phosphorylation or the phosphorylation of coprecipitated p95erbb2. hrg is also a ligand for
 xxxg723xxx ; however, we were unable to demonstrate  xxxg723xxx 
expression in these cells (data not shown).
in vivo, treatment with  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited phosphorylation of  xxxg721xxx  and p95erbb2 in bt474 tumor
xenografts when compared with vehicle treatment alone
(figure 6a, upper and lower panels). we next examined
bt474 tumor xenografts for the presence of erbb3p95erbb2 heterodimers in mice treated with  xxxd2445xxx 
(100 mg/kg/dose) or vehicle alone.  xxxg722xxx  ips were
analysed by western blot using either a ptyr
(figure 6b, upper panel) or a erbb2 (peptides 1243–
1253) (figure 6b, lower panel) abs.  xxxg722xxx -p95erbb2
heterodimers were identiﬁed in tumor xenografts
(figure 6b, upper and lower panels). furthermore,
 xxxd2445xxx  treatment inhibited  xxxg722xxx  and p95erbb2
tyrosine phosphorylation compared with vehicle treatment alone (figure 6b, upper panel).
p95erbb2 did not associate with egfr (figure 6c,
upper and lower panels). in contrast, full-length
 xxxg721xxx  formed heterodimers with egfr (lower
panel). moreover,  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited egfr tyrosine
phosphorylation (upper panel).
the cytoplasmic domain of  xxxg722xxx  contains at least
seven tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for the
p85 subunit of pi3k (prigent and gullick, 1994; soltoff
et al., 1994). phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues
leads to akt phosphorylation and activation. since

discussion
despite recent advances in breast cancer therapy, nearly
40 000 people died from metastatic breast cancer in
2001. elucidating the pathways regulating breast cancer
cell growth and survival might provide additional
targets for therapeutic intervention. proteolytic cleavage
of the erbb2 ecd results in the expression of a
truncated erbb2 receptor (p95erbb2), which exerts potent
oncogenic signals in preclinical models (di fiore et al.,
1987; bargmann and weinberg, 1988; segatto et al.,
1988). moreover, tumor expression of p95erbb2 has been
linked to metastatic progression in erbb2-overexpressing breast cancers (christianson et al., 1998; molina
et al., 2002). whereas the role of  xxxg721xxx  in regulating
breast cancer cell growth and survival has been
extensively studied, relatively little is known about
p95erbb2. here, we show that p95erbb2 is constitutively
activated in breast cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts. since erbb2 tyrosine phosphorylation is a
biochemical marker of increased cell transformation
activity, these data implicate activated, phospho-p95erbb2
as playing a role in metastatic progression of breast
cancer. we now show that p95erbb2 preferentially
heterodimerizes with  xxxg722xxx  in bt474 breast cancer
cells and tumor xenografts. consequently, hrg, but
not egf, stimulates p95erbb2 phosphorylation, which
has consequences on downstream mediators of tumor
growth and survival (e.g., akt). these data identify
p95erbb2 as a target for therapeutic intervention.
oncogene

engineered truncated erbb2 receptors possess enhanced cell transformation activity compared with
 xxxg721xxx  (di fiore et al., 1987; bargmann and weinberg, 1988; segatto et al., 1988). deletions within the
ecd of erbb2 increase erbb2 autokinase and transformation activities, implicating sites within the ecd as
exerting repressive effects on erbb2 activity. these
ﬁndings are reminiscent of a deletion mutation within
the ecd of egfr (viii mutation) present in a variety
of malignancies and associated with constitutive, ligandindependent activation of egfr (wong et al., 1992).
the increased oncogenic properties of p95erbb2 are
consistent with the link between p95erbb2 expression
and metastatic progression in erbb2-overexpressing
breast cancers.
to elucidate the link between p95erbb2 expression in
breast cancer and metastatic progression, we investigated the regulation of p95erbb2 in human breast cancer
cells and tumor xenografts. since  xxxg682xxx  receptors signal
primarily through heterodimer complexes, it was necessary to address whether p95erbb2 forms heterodimers,
and if so, with what  xxxg682xxx  receptors.  xxxg722xxx  and
 xxxg721xxx  are frequently coexpressed in breast cancers
(lemoine et al., 1992; rajkumar and gullick, 1994;
alimandi et al., 1995; siegel et al., 1999). moreover,
 xxxg722xxx - xxxg721xxx  heterodimers represent one of the most
potent mitogenic, transforming receptor complexes.
coexpression of  xxxg722xxx  and  xxxg721xxx , but not egfr
and  xxxg722xxx , synergizes to transform nih3t3 cells,
whereby erbb2 transphosphorylates and activates
 xxxg722xxx  (alimandi et al., 1995). since  xxxg722xxx  contains
multiple docking sites for the sh2 domain of the p85
subunit of pi3k,  xxxg722xxx -containing heterodimers are
potent activators of the pi3k-akt growth and survival
pathway (prigent and gullick, 1994; soltoff et al., 1994).
consequently, cotransfection of  xxxg722xxx  and  xxxg721xxx 
activates the pi3k-akt pathway. in addition, heterodimerization with  xxxg721xxx  enhances the binding afﬁnity
of hrg for  xxxg722xxx . in this context, aberrant activation
of the pi3k-akt pathway in breast and other
carcinomas predicts for a poorer clinical outcome
(cheng et al., 1992; vivanco and sawyers, 2002; yakes
et al., 2002).
here, we show that p95erbb2 preferentially associates
with  xxxg722xxx , whereas  xxxg721xxx  heterodimerizes with
both egfr and  xxxg722xxx . this provides an explanation
for the regulation of p95erbb2 phosphorylation by hrg,
but not egf with subsequent downstream activation of
akt. however, hrg-induced  xxxg722xxx  phosphorylation
was not effectively blocked by  xxxd2445xxx  despite
inhibition of  xxxg721xxx  and p95erbb2 tyrosine phosphorylation (figure 5, lower panel). although hrg also
activates  xxxg723xxx , we were unable to detect  xxxg723xxx  in
these cells (data not shown). these data are consistent
with a recent observation, suggesting that some of the
biological effects of hrg may be mediated via a
mechanism independent of  xxxg722xxx  or  xxxg723xxx  (beerli et al.,
1995).

xenografts (rusnak et al., 2001; xia et al., 2002).
although preliminary,  xxxd2445xxx  has shown antitumor
activity in early-phase clinical trials in heavily pretreated
subjects with metastatic cancers, notably breast cancer
(manuscript in preparation). in this context, we now
show that  xxxd2445xxx  inhibits p95erbb2 phosphorylation,
blocking the activation of downstream  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt,
and cyclin d protein levels in bt474 breast cancer cells
and tumor xenografts. in contrast, trastuzumab, which
binds to the ecd of erbb2, did not block p95erbb2
activation. in our hands, trastuzumab had little effect on
steady-state protein levels of p- xxxg1369xxx /2, p-akt, and
cyclin d in tumor cell lines and tumor xenografts. the
mechanism(s) by which trastuzumab exerts its antitumor
activity remains unknown and is likely multifactorial,
mediated through both immunological effects, which are
independent of its modulation of erbb2 phosphorylation, as well as effects on signal transduction pathways.
nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that signaling
through p95erbb2-containing heterodimers, which would
not be affected by an antibody like trastuzumab directed
against the erbb2 ecd, might contribute to trastuzumab resistance, which is most likely a multifactorial
process.
p95erbb2 has been implicated in the progression of
erbb2-overexpressing breast cancers. cleavage of the
ecd of erbb2 appears to be mediated by an mmp
family member (codony-servat et al., 1999). increased
mmp activity stimulates tumor angiogenesis and
degradation of the extracellular matrix, both key events
for metastases (stamenkovic, 2000). during metastatic
progression, increased mmp activity may explain the
increased cleavage of  xxxg721xxx . in addition, erbb3p95erbb2 heterodimers potently activate the pi3k-akt
pathway, the latter being implicated in hormonal/
chemotherapy resistance. this explanation is particularly relevant to breast cancer where coexpression of
 xxxg722xxx  and erbb2 occurs frequently. however, the
nature of the signal generated by  xxxg682xxx  receptor
complexes is not only dependent upon the repertoire
of  xxxg682xxx  receptors expressed by tumors but also the
 xxxg682xxx  receptor ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment. hrg, an  xxxg722xxx / xxxg723xxx  ligand, is expressed in the microenvironment of many tumors,
notably breast cancer (tsai et al., 2003). our data
suggest that hrg, but not egf, activates p95erbb2erbb3 heterodimers, which has downstream effects on
akt activation and clinical implications related to
disease progression and resistance to therapy.
in the future, cancer therapy will be based on
molecular tumor proﬁles rather than histology. elucidating the biological effects of targeted therapies will
help identify those factors regulating tumor cell growth
and survival, thereby facilitating identiﬁcation of likely
responders and providing a rationale for therapeutic
strategies to overcome resistance. although trastuzumab may reduce erbb2 cleavage by binding to the ecd
(molina et al., 2001), in our hands it did not block
p95erbb2 activation or downstream signaling. resistance
to trastuzumab therapy may therefore be partly
mediated through increased expression of p95erbb2

during disease progression. one potential clinical
advantage of  xxxd2445xxx  over trastuzumab is that the
former potently inhibits not only the activation of
egfr and  xxxg721xxx  but also that of p95erbb2. identiﬁcation of p95erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimers and their activation
by hrg implicate this receptor complex as a mediator
of prosurvival signals and a target for therapeutic
intervention. hence, the expression of p95erbb2 may
identify patients more likely to beneﬁt from  xxxd2445xxx 
therapy compared with trastuzumab. combining trastuzumab with  xxxd2445xxx  is an appealing therapeutic
strategy in breast cancer since it may abrogate p95erbb2
signaling by simultaneously inhibiting erbb2 cleavage
and blocking p95erbb2 autophosphorylation.

hn5, an egfr-overexpressing licr-lon-hn5 head and
neck carcinoma cell line, was kindly provided by helmout
modjtahedi at the institute of cancer research, surrey, uk.
the erbb2 overexpressing human breast adenocarcinoma cell
line, bt474, was obtained from the american type culture
collection (manassas, va, usa). hb4a cells are derived from
human mammary luminal tissue; erbb2 transfection of
parental hb4a cells yielded the hb4a c5.2 cell line (harris
et al., 1999). s1 cells, which express elevated levels of p-erbb2,
were established by subcloning hb4a c5.2 (xia et al., 2002).
egf was purchased from sigma chemical (st louis, mo,
usa). recombinant human  xxxg881xxx -b1/hrgb1 egfr
domain (hrg) was obtained from rd system (minneapolis,
mn, usa). antiphosphotyrosine antibody was purchased
from sigma and upstate (lake placid, ny, usa). antiegfr (ab-12) and anti-c-erbb2 (ab-11) mabs were obtained
from neo markers (union city, ca, usa). anti-erbb2
(aa1243-1255), antiphospho-erbb2 (y1248), and anticyclin
d1/2 were obtained from upstate. antiphospho-akt (ser
437) mab was obtained from cell signaling technology, inc.
(beverly, ma, usa). anti- xxxg722xxx  (c17), anti-akt1/2, antiphospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, anti- xxxg1369xxx , and anti- xxxg1366xxx  antibodies were

boehringer mannheim (germany). irdye800 conjugated
afﬁnity puriﬁed anti-rabbit igg and anti-mouse igg were
obtained from rockland (gilbertsville, pa, usa). alexa
fluor680 goat anti-rabbit igg was obtained from molecular
probes (eugene, or, usa).  xxxd2445xxx , n-{3-chloro-4-[(3ﬂuorobenzyl)oxy]phenyl}-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)-2-furyl]-4-quinazolinamine, was synthesized as previously described (cockerill et al., 2001).  xxxd2445xxx  for cell
culture work was dissolved in dmso.
cell cultures
bt474 cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with lglutamine, 10% fbs (hyclone), and 5 m/ml insulin. hb4a cells
were cultured under identical conditions to bt474 cells, in
addition, with 10 mg/ml hydrocortisone. s1 cells were cultured
in rpmi 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fbs, and
50 mg/ml hygromycin. hn5 cells were cultured in dmem
supplemented with high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum
oncogene

(fbs). all cell cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% co2 at 371c.
egf and hrg stimulation experiments
cells were seeded at low density in serum-free medium
supplemented with 1.5%. bsa, and then exposed for 6–24 h
to  xxxd2445xxx  at various concentrations indicated in the ﬁgure
legends, or 10 mg/ml trastuzumab. cells were stimulated with
50 ng/ml egf or 5 nm hrg for 15 min, harvested on ice, and
then lysed in ripa buffer (150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.5, 0.25% (w/v)  xxxd1835xxx , 1% np-40, 5 mm sodium
orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium ﬂuoride, and a protease inhibitor
cocktail).
ip and western blots
ips and western blots were performed as previously described
(xia et al., 2002). brieﬂy, protein concentrations were
determined using a modiﬁcation of the bradford method
(bio-rad laboratory), and equal amounts of protein subjected to ip and western blot. efﬁciency and equal loading of
proteins were evaluated by ponceau s staining. membranes
were blocked for 1 h in tbs (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 150 mm
nacl, 2.7 mm kcl) containing 4% (w/v) low-fat milk or 3%
bsa (w/v). membranes were then probed with speciﬁc
antibodies recognizing target proteins, which were visualized
with the supersignal west femto maximum sensitivity
substrate kit (pierce). other blots were visualized and
quantiﬁcation performed using the odyssey infrared imaging

system (li-cor, inc., lincoln, ne, usa). for the odyssey,
membranes were incubated with ﬂuorescent-labeled secondary
antibody at 1 : 10 000 dilution with 3% bsa in pbs for 60-min
protected from light. after washing in pbs þ 0.1% tween-20,
the membranes were scanned using an odyssey infrared
imaging system.
tumor xenografts
bt474 tumors were maintained by serial passage of fragments
into female c.b-17 scid mice, for up to 10 passages. once
tumor implants were palpable, mice were administered either
vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/0.1% tween 80)
given orally (p.o.), ﬁve doses of  xxxd2445xxx  at 100 mg/kg (p.o.)
twice daily at 8 h intervals, or trastuzumab at 100 mg/kg given
intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 3 days. tumors were removed
4 h after the last dose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
801c until analysis. for the terminal biopsy, mice were
euthanized with co2 inhalation. cell extracts were prepared
by homogenization in ripa buffer at 41c.
