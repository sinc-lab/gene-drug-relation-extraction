 xxxd3078xxx 
 xxxd3078xxx 
abstract

 xxxd3078xxx  [ xxxd3078xxx ] is a melatonin (mt1/mt2) receptor agonist that is being
developed by takeda as a treatment for sleep disorders. it is undergoing regulatory review in the us, phase iii trials in europe, and phase ii trials in japan for the
treatment of insomnia. phase ii trials are also being conducted in the us for the
treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders
in september 2004, takeda submitted an nda to the us fda for  xxxd3078xxx 
for the treatment of insomnia.[1]
in may 2003, data presented at the 156th annual meeting of the american
psychiatric association report that  xxxd3078xxx  is highly selective for the mt1
receptor, and has greater affinity, selectivity and potency than melatonin.[2]

1. profile
1.1 pharmacokinetics

in a randomised, double-blind study in 60 volunteers,  xxxd3078xxx  (4–64mg) was rapidly absorbed at
all dose levels, with a tmax of <1h. reasonably good
dose proportionality was demonstrated by auc and
cmax values, with elimination half-lives being independent of dose.[3]
the oral absorption of  xxxd3078xxx  is excellent, but
the drug undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.
in a two-period, crossover study, 18 healthy male

subjects received a tablet formulation (16mg) and
a 5-minute iv infusion (2mg) of  xxxd3078xxx . the
absolute bioavailability, based on the ratio for
auc0-omega,norm between the tablet and iv formulation
following a single oral dose was <2% (ranging from
0.5% to 12%). previous studies with radiolabelled
 xxxd3078xxx  have shown that up to 84% of the orally
administered dose was recovered in the urine.[4]
1.2 adverse events

animal toxicology:  xxxd3078xxx  (3–30 mg/kg po)
and melatonin (3–100 mg/kg po) did not affect
learning and memory in rats. this was assessed by

the morris water-maze task and the delayed matching-to-position task. in contrast, the benzodiazepines diazepam and triazolam markedly impaired learning and memory in both tasks.  xxxd3078xxx  (3–30 mg/kg po) had no significant effect on
motor coordination in mice, as assessed by the rotarod performance test, while diazepam did impair
motor coordination. unlike melatonin,  xxxd3078xxx 
did not exacerbate benzodiazepine-induced motor
dysfunction.[5]
nocturnal melatonin levels in rats were not significantly affected by chronic treatment with
 xxxd3078xxx  (0.3 or 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days).[6]
1.3 pharmacodynamics
1.3.1 anxiety disorders

receptor binding studies:  xxxd3078xxx  had a ki
value of 25.4 pmol/l for chick forebrain melatonin
mt1 receptors, and a ki value of 2600 nmol/l for
hamster brain mt2 receptors. the affinities of
 xxxd3078xxx  for mt1 and mt2 receptors were 15 times
higher and 100 times lower, respectively, than those
of melatonin.  xxxd3078xxx  had weak affinity for
dopamine d1 receptors and serotonin1a receptors.
 xxxd3078xxx  had no significant affinity for any other
receptors tested in binding assays, including various
neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, cytokines, growth
factors and ion channels.[7,8]
 xxxd3078xxx  has 10-fold greater affinity for mt1
receptor and a 100-fold smaller affinity for mt2
receptor than endogenous melatonin. it has no affinity for gaba, opiate, peptide or cytokine neurotransmitters.[2]

 xxxd3078xxx  (0.03–3 mg/kg po) shortened the latency to sleep onset in freely moving monkeys in a
dose-dependent manner. duration of sleep was increased by  xxxd3078xxx , particularly the amount of
slow-wave sleep.  xxxd3078xxx  also had a tendency to
increase rem sleep. as evidenced by eeg, sleep
patterns in response to  xxxd3078xxx  were indistinguishable from those of naturally occurring sleep.
 xxxd3078xxx  did not have any effect on the general
behaviour of the monkeys. in contrast to the effects
of  xxxd3078xxx , zolpidem (10–30 mg/kg po) had little
effect on sleep latency. zolpidem (30 mg/kg) tended
to decrease rem sleep and increase slow-wave
sleep, but also induced apparent sedation and myorelaxation. the eeg power spectrum after administration of zolpidem was qualitatively different from
that of naturally occurring sleep.[9,10]
1.4 therapeutic trials
1.4.1 anxiety disorders

results from a phase ii study showed that
 xxxd3078xxx  reduced the time to sleep onset and increased the total sleep duration in patients with
primary chronic insomnia according to dsm iv
criteria. the study enrolled 107 patients who were
randomised to receive  xxxd3078xxx  doses of 4mg,
8mg, 16mg and 32mg, or placebo, 30 minutes before
bedtime on two consecutive nights; patients were
treated for five cycles, with a 5- or 12-day washout
period between each. compared with placebo,
 xxxd3078xxx  at all doses significantly reduced the
mean objective latency to persistent sleep (37.7 min
vs 22.9–24.3 min, respectively; p < 0.001). a signifdrugs r d 2005; 6 (3)

icant increase in the mean total sleep time was
observed in patients treated with  xxxd3078xxx  doses of
4–23mg, compared with those given placebo
(411–418.2 min vs 400.2 min, respectively).[11]
