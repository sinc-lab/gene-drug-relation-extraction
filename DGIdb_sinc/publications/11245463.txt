abstract
regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as
aspirin and  xxxd3259xxx  is associated with a decreased mortality from colorectal cancer.  xxxd3259xxx  causes regression of precancerous adenomatous
polyps and inhibits the growth of cultured colon cell lines. whereas
induction of apoptotic cell death is thought to account for the growth
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3259xxx , less is known about its biochemical mechanism(s) of action.  xxxd3259xxx  is metabolized in vivo to sulfide and sulfone
derivatives. both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of  xxxd3259xxx  as well as
more potent  xxxd1274xxx -dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitors were
shown to cause inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(erk)1/2 phosphorylation at doses (40 – 600 ␮m) and times (1–5 days)
consistent with the induction of apoptosis by the drugs. treatment of
hct116 human colon cancer cells with the specific mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase,  xxxd3462xxx  (5–50 ␮m) resulted in a time- and dosedependent inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis.  xxxd3462xxx  treatment (20 ␮m) increased basal apoptosis, and potentiated the apoptotic effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. these
results suggest that the inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation is responsible for at least part of the induction of programmed cell death by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity may, therefore, be a
useful biochemical target for the development of chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic drugs for human colon cancer.

introduction
colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the
united states (1). a large body of animal model and human epidemiological and clinical intervention data indicate that nsaids3 have
chemopreventive activity for colorectal cancer. numerous casecontrol and cohort studies show an inverse relationship between
ingestion of nsaids and development of colon cancer (2). nsaids,
including  xxxd3259xxx , inhibit adenoma formation in the min-mouse, an
animal model of human fap (3) and also inhibit azoxymethaneinduced colorectal cancer in rats and mice (4 – 6).  xxxd3259xxx  treatment
also causes regression of existing colonic polyps and prevents formation of new polyps throughout the colon in patients with fap (7–11).
the striking regression of colonic neoplasms by  xxxd3259xxx  is one of the
most dramatic examples of the power of a chemopreventive agent not
only to prevent but also to reverse the process of carcinogenesis.
 xxxd3259xxx  is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized to two major
derivatives; the sulfide metabolite is an active nsaid that inhibits
both cox-1 and cox-2 and, thereby, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis
(12). by contrast, the sulfone metabolite is not an nsaid because it
received 7/27/00; accepted 12/13/00.

does not inhibit either cox-1 or cox-2 and does not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (6, 12, 13) both  xxxd3259xxx  and its sulfone metabolite have chemopreventive activity; both drugs prevent tumor formation in chemically induced animal models of colon (4 – 6), breast (14,
15), and lung cancer (16, 17). these observations originally suggested
that cox inhibition was not necessary for the chemopreventive
activity of some of the nsaids and related compounds.
several lines of evidence suggest that the biological mechanism of
the chemopreventive action of  xxxd3259xxx  is the selective induction of
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in neoplastic cells. both  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induce apoptosis in many cancer cell
lines in vitro (12, 18 –23).  xxxd3259xxx  treatment also increases the rate of
apoptosis in adenomas from fap patients 3-fold, with no apparent
effect on cell proliferation (24). whereas apoptosis primarily accounts
for the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx , less is known about the
biochemical mechanisms of apoptotic induction by  xxxd3259xxx . nsaids
are classically defined by their ability to inhibit cox-1 and -2.
however, nsaids including  xxxd3259xxx  can induce apoptosis in cell
lines such as hct15 that have no cox-1 or -2 expression (13). in
addition, the sulfone metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx , which does not inhibit
cox-1 or -2, induces apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and prevents
tumor formation in animal models of colon (6), breast (14, 15), and
lung cancer (16, 17).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone and related compounds inhibit cgpde, increase
cgmp concentrations, and increase pkg activity in colon cancer cell
lines with a dose and time dependence that suggests that cgpde
inhibition is the proximate mediator of growth inhibition and apoptosis of these drugs (25). pkg is known to affect several signal
transduction pathways that could mediate apoptosis. however, the
mechanism of apoptotic cell death that follows cgpde inhibition by
these drugs is not known.
mutation of the  xxxg1285xxx  proto-oncogene is a common, early event in
colon cancer development (26). activated ras recruits c-raf to the
plasma membrane where it activates  xxxg1361xxx /2, which then phosphorylates its only known substrate,  xxxg1369xxx /2. activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 culminates in phosphorylation of transcription factors responsible for
regulating genes that enhance cell proliferation and protect cells from
apoptosis (27). cancer cells with ras mutations appear to be more
susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx  than those with
wild-type ras. in a rat model of azoxymethane-induced colonic neoplasia,  xxxd3259xxx  preferentially inhibited the growth of tumors with
 xxxg1285xxx  mutations from 90 to 36% of all tumors (28). similarly,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone preferentially suppressed the number of mammary tumors
containing h-ras mutations in a  xxxd2685xxx -induced model of
rat mammary carcinogenesis (15).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide has been reported
to physically bind to ras protein in vitro, and this interaction prevented binding of c-raf to ras (29). in addition, pkg can phosphorylate c-raf and inhibit its interaction with ras (30). taken together,
these data suggest the hypothesis that the biochemical mechanism of
apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites may be attributable to effects on
ras signaling pathways.
as a downstream effector of ras signaling,  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation is often up-regulated in cancers harboring ras mutations. colon
tumors displayed especially high levels of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in

 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation

a screening study of ⬎100 tumors (31). inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in vitro by a synthetic  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd1688xxx ,
decreased soft agar growth and inhibited the transformed phenotype
of colon 26 cells. in vivo,  xxxd1688xxx  suppressed the growth of mouse
and human colon tumor xenografts (32). we, therefore, tested the
hypothesis that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites cause apoptosis by down-regulating  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling in human colon cancer cells. this was
determined by western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies
raised against  xxxg1369xxx /2 and  xxxg1361xxx /2. both of the  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites
caused the inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation at times and doses
consistent with cleavage of caspase-3 and -7 and nuclear morphology
indicative of apoptotic cell death. to further examine the role of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 down-regulation and apoptotic induction, colon cancer cells
were treated with the  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx .  xxxd3462xxx  substantially
inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, induced apoptosis alone, and potentiated apoptosis induced by both of the  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. these
results indicate that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2, and this
inhibition is sufficient to cause programmed cell death in human colon
cancer cells, which suggests that this is one mechanism of the chemopreventive effect of  xxxd3259xxx .
materials and methods

immunoreactive protein was detected by incubating blots with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h followed by chemiluminescent substrate for 1 min. immunoreactive proteins were visualized by exposure
to film. quantitation of protein levels was determined by densitometry using a
computerized visual imaging system (bio-rad, hercules, ca). after the first
western blot using phospho-specific antibodies, the membranes were stripped
for 30 min in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfide, 67 mm tris (ph 6.7), and 0.8%
 xxxd26xxx , while rocking at 50°c, and washed twice for 10 min each
in tris-buffered normal saline with 0.05% tween 20. blots were then reblocked
and probed with pan- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1 ␮g/ml) or pan- xxxg1361xxx /2 (1:5000) primary antibodies as described above. independent experiments validated that this stripping
procedure did not lead to loss of signal.

results
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in
human colon cancer cells.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide treatment of hct116
cells resulted in a time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis
(fig. 1a), as determined by examining nuclear morphology after
staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. low levels of
apoptosis were seen at 24 h at the highest dose (120 ␮m) of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide; both doses resulted in progressively increased levels of apoptosis at 48, 72, and 120 h.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide caused a similar timeand dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (figs. 1b
and 2a and b), as determined by western blotting with a monoclonal
antibody raised against phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx  (the same peptide sequence is present in phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx ). significant inhibition of

american type cell culture (manassas, va) and maintained in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/

treatment with vehicle or drug in the experiments described below.
morphological apoptosis assay. apoptosis and viability were quantified
by staining cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, then by assaying

 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation

fig. 2.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide inhibits phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx  ( xxxd1355xxx ; a) and  xxxg1366xxx  (p42; b) proteins, but not total  xxxg1369xxx  ( xxxd1355xxx ; c) or total  xxxg1366xxx  (p42; d) protein. line graphs, the mean
and se from at least three independent experiments. ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.05 versus day 0 control.

 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation occurred by 12 h and persisted
through 72 h after treatment (p ⬍ 0.05). decreased phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2
was detected by 12 h, but not earlier than 8 h after  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide
treatment (data not shown). phosphorylation of both  xxxg1369xxx  ( xxxd1355xxx ) and
 xxxg1366xxx  (p42) was reduced to similar extents. the inhibitory effect of
 xxxd3259xxx  on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity was confirmed using an in vitro  xxxg1369xxx /2
kinase assay using elk-1 as a substrate (data not shown). the amount
of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein expression was similar to vehicle-treated cells
except at 72 h of treatment, when  xxxg1369xxx  was significantly reduced
compared with vehicle control (p ⬍ 0.05; figs. 1b and 2, c and d).
like the nsaid  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, the non-nsaid  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone also caused a dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis
that was detectable at the higher dose (600 ␮m) by 24 h, with
progressively increased apoptotic levels with both drug doses at 72
and 120 h (fig. 3a).  xxxd3259xxx  resulted in inhibition of phosphoerk1/2 expression by 12 h of drug treatment that persisted
through 72 h (figs. 3b and 4a and b), without decreased expression of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein, except for total  xxxg1369xxx  at 72 h after
treatment (figs. 3b and 4, c and d). the  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibitory effect
of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone was confirmed with an in vitro  xxxg1369xxx /2 kinase
assay using elk-1 as a substrate (data not shown). similar apoptotic
induction and  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition were seen for both  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone using two additional human colon
cancer cell lines, ht29 and sw480 (data not shown).
in addition to  xxxg1369xxx /2, we also examined the phosphorylation state
of two other map kinases, jnk and p38, by western blotting with
phospho-specific antibodies. no consistent changes in the phosphorylation of jnk or p38, or in the expression of total jnk or p38
proteins were detected after treatment with either  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide or
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone metabolites (data not shown). in some individual
experiments, increased levels of phospho-jnk were detected; how-

ever, the drugs could induce apoptotic cell death in the absence of any
apparent change in jnk phosphorylation.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation in
human colon cancer cells. the only characterized upstream activator of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is  xxxg1361xxx /2 (27). we, therefore, determined whether
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by inhibiting its
upstream activator,  xxxg1361xxx /2. like  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1361xxx /2 is activated by
phosphorylation, and phospho-specific antibodies were used to assay
 xxxg1361xxx /2 activity by western blotting.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (fig. 1b) and
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (fig. 3b) inhibited  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation with a
time and dose dependence similar to that of  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition, which
indicated that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
by acting upstream of, and not at the level of,  xxxg1369xxx /2. unlike total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 expression, total  xxxg1361xxx /2 expression, as determined by
western blotting with pan- xxxg1361xxx /2 antibody, was decreased after
treatment with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (fig. 1b) or  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (fig. 3b).
however, inhibition of  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation, apparent by 12 h
after treatment, preceded the loss of total  xxxg1361xxx /2 protein, which
occurred after 24 h of treatment.
more potent cgpde inhibitors cp248 and cp461 inhibit
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. the more potent inhibitors of cgpde,
cp248 and cp461, induce apoptosis of cancer cells at substantially
lower doses than do  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (25). to
determine whether  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and apoptotic induction were
common mechanisms of cgpde-inhibitory agents, colon cancer cells
were treated with cp248 and cp461 and analyzed for phospho-erk
expression. cp248 (5 and 10 ␮m) and cp461 (10 and 50 ␮m) caused
a dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis (data not shown)
and inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (fig. 5). this suggests that
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation may be a common mechanism
of action of this class of antineoplastic agents, and that the effect is not

induce apoptosis. apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear morphology
(data not shown).
next, we determined the effect of  xxxd3462xxx  on  xxxd3259xxx  metaboliteinduced  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and apoptosis. hct116 cells were pretreated with vehicle (0.1% dmso) or 20 ␮m  xxxd3462xxx  and, after 30 min,
were treated with vehicle (0.1% dmso), 80 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, or
200 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. western blotting of phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2
was performed to confirm inhibition by  xxxd3462xxx .  xxxd3462xxx  caused substantial inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation from 30 min (data not
shown) to 48 h after treatment (fig. 8a). total  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein levels
were not decreased in  xxxd3462xxx -treated compared with control lysates.
 xxxd3462xxx  treatment alone induced apoptosis of hct116 cells and potentiated the apoptotic effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
(fig. 8b).
discussion

fig. 3. in a,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces apoptosis of human colon cancer cells. hct116
cells were treated with vehicle (0.2% dmso) or with 400 or 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone and
harvested at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days after treatment. apoptotic induction was determined by
staining cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. apoptotic cells were determined
by nuclear morphology. samples were done in triplicate; error bars, se. in b,  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone inhibits phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and  xxxg1361xxx /2. hct116 cells were treated with
0.2% dmso or with 400 or 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone and were harvested at 0, 24, 48, and
72 h after treatment. cell lysates were prepared for sds-page and analyzed by western
blotting with phospho-specific  xxxg1369xxx /2 or phospho-specific  xxxg1361xxx /2 antibody; they were
then stripped and reprobed with pan- xxxg1369xxx /2 or pan- xxxg1361xxx /2 antibody.

limited to  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites alone. there was a similar level of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition by cp248 and cp461 compared with  xxxd3259xxx 
doses that induced equivalent apoptotic responses.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites activate cleavage of caspase-3 and
caspase-7.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (120 ␮m) and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (600 ␮m)
both induced cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (fig. 6) at times
preceding morphological apoptosis. cleavage of caspase-3 and -7 was
detectable as early as 12 h after treatment, whereas changes in nuclear
morphology were usually not apparent until at least 24 h and were
maximal at 5 days after treatment. cleavage of both caspase-3 and
caspase-7 occurred at similar times and to the same extent in both
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide- and sulfone-treated cells. in all of the experiments,
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation was seen concomitant with
caspase cleavage.
 xxxd3462xxx  stimulates apoptosis and potentiates apoptosis induced
by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. to determine whether inhibition of erk
activity alone could induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells, an additional method of suppressing erk phosphorylation was sought.
 xxxd3462xxx  is a highly specific inhibitor of  xxxg1361xxx /2 that has been used
extensively as a tool to manipulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling (36). hct116
cells were treated with 0, 10, 25, or 50 ␮m  xxxd3462xxx  and were harvested
after 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h after treatment. at all of the doses,  xxxd3462xxx 
completely blocked erk phosphorylation by 30 min (fig. 7). a
persistent dose-dependent inhibition of erk phosphorylation was
seen at 24 and 48 h after treatment. at these doses,  xxxd3462xxx  induced
cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7 at 48 h (fig. 7b), which indicated
that persistent down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation is able to

 xxxd3259xxx  has a dramatic chemoregressive effect on the colonic
adenomas of patients with familial polyposis (7–11). there is evidence that the biological mechanism of this chemopreventive effect is
the induction of apoptosis in neoplastic cells, but the biochemical
mechanism of this apoptotic effect is incompletely understood.
nsaids inhibit cox-1 and -2 and thereby decrease prostaglandin
synthesis. in this study, however, we have shown that both the active
nsaid metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx  ( xxxd3259xxx  sulfide) and the non-nsaid
metabolite ( xxxd3259xxx  sulfone) selectively inhibit the  xxxg1361xxx /2- xxxg1369xxx /2
arm of the ras signaling pathway at doses and times consistent with
apoptotic induction. the comparable inhibitory effects of both of the
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites indicate that these effects are independent of
cox inhibition. furthermore, we have shown that  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition
by  xxxd3462xxx , a highly selective  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor that is structurally
unrelated to nsaids, also induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells.
these studies indicate that  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition alone is sufficient to
induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells and suggest that down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 may be a mechanism of the apoptotic cell death
induced by  xxxd3259xxx .
although apoptotic induction of cultured cells by chemical inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 has been described in other systems (37), to our
knowledge, this is the first report that  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition can cause
apoptotic cell death in cultured human colon cancer cells. erk
activation is commonly thought to protect many different types of
cells from apoptosis, predominantly in neuronal models of growth
factor withdrawal (37). one mechanism by which cancer cells maintain their growth advantage may be via activation of antiapoptotic
pathways such as  xxxg1369xxx /2. this may be particularly relevant to colon
cancer because mutation of  xxxg1285xxx  occurs commonly during colon
cancer development, and these mutations result in activation of the
 xxxg1369xxx /2 arm of the ras signaling pathway (26).  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity is
higher in colon cancer cells with mutant  xxxg1285xxx  than in those with
wild-type  xxxg1285xxx  (38), and ras mutant cell lines are differentially
sensitive to the apoptotic effects of nsaids (39). cells that have
become dependent on high levels of  xxxg1285xxx  signaling for survival may
be more affected by inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2. our results indicate that
persistent inhibition of the pro-proliferative  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is sufficient to cause the colon cancer cells in culture to undergo apoptotic
cell death.
our results are also the first indication that inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
signaling plays a role in  xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis. both of the
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation at times and
doses that are consistent with apoptotic induction, without causing an
equivalent decrease in total  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein expression. the time
course of effects indicate that the onset of erk inhibition occurs
before the earliest morphological evidence of apoptotic cell death and

concomitant with the earliest evidence of caspase cleavage. these
results suggest that erk inhibition may not be the result of apoptotic
cell death and that it occurs in a time frame such that it could be
inducing the apoptotic process.

fig. 6.  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites induce cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7. hct116 cells
were treated with 0.2% dmso or with 120 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide or 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone and were harvested 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. cell lysates were prepared for
sds-page and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies specific for cleaved
caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-7.

fig. 5. potent cgpde inhibitors inhibit phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. hct116 cells
were treated with 0.1% dmso or with 5 ␮m or 10 ␮m cp248 (a) and 0.1% dmso or 10
␮m or 50 ␮m cp461 (b), and were harvested 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. cell
lysates were prepared for sds-page and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies
specific for phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 or phospho- xxxg1361xxx /2; they were then stripped, and reprobed
with total  xxxg1369xxx /2 or total  xxxg1361xxx /2 antibody.

the observation that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit phosphorylation
of  xxxg1361xxx /2, the upstream activator of  xxxg1369xxx /2, suggests that  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity by decreasing  xxxg1361xxx /2-dependent phosphorylation. these effects are likely to be at the level of
 xxxg1361xxx /2 or upstream. the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide to bind ras
protein in vitro and inhibit association with c-raf (29), the upstream
activator of  xxxg1361xxx /2, is a possible mechanism of the effects of
 xxxd3259xxx  on  xxxg1369xxx /2. the decrease in total  xxxg1361xxx /2 protein at later
times indicates that  xxxd3259xxx  induces proteolytic cleavage or inhibits
the transcription or translation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 protein.
cgpde is a direct biochemical target for non-nsaid apoptotic
agents such as  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, cp248, and cp461 (25). we found
that several of the cgpde inhibitors have in common the ability to
inhibit erk activity at doses that induce apoptotic cell death. pkg
activation that follows cgpde inhibition by  xxxd3259xxx -like compounds
may result in down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling. of interest,
c- xxxg1924xxx  is a substrate for activated pkg, and pkg-mediated phos-

 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation

phorylation of c- xxxg1924xxx  results in the inhibition of raf activity and
dissociation from ras (30). the inhibition of c- xxxg1924xxx  activity would
down-regulate  xxxg1361xxx /2 and, therefore,  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling.
treatment of colon cancer cells with  xxxd3462xxx  led to a profound
transient inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation followed by a doserelated persistence of the effect that was associated with the induction
of apoptotic cell death. thus, to the extent that  xxxd3462xxx  has selective
effects on mek and erk, this result suggests that erk inhibition is
sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells. the time
course suggests that the duration of erk inhibition may be important
for the apoptotic effect in that both the  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites and the
higher doses of  xxxd3462xxx  led to comparable erk inhibition that lasted
24 – 48 h and led to the induction of apoptotic cell death.  xxxd3462xxx 
substantially potentiated the apoptotic effect of both of the  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites, which suggests that these compounds together lead to
greater inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2-mediated signaling. however, the level
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition did not correlate well with the level of apoptotic
cell death by these structurally unrelated compounds. for example, 20
␮m  xxxd3462xxx  and 200 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induced similar amounts of
apoptosis, whereas  xxxd3462xxx  was much more effective at inhibiting
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation than  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (fig. 8). this implies
that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites also have effects on additional apoptotic
pathways, which have an additive or synergistic effect on the induction of apoptotic cell death. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 may, therefore,
account for part, but not all, of the apoptotic effect of  xxxd3259xxx .
 xxxd3259xxx  affects additional signaling pathways that may induce apoptotic cell death, including cgpde (25), nuclear factor-␬b (40), and
lipoxygenase (41). it is possible that some of these separate biochemical effects are in fact interdependent. future studies will address
possible interactions between  xxxg1369xxx /2 and these alternate biochemical
targets of  xxxd3259xxx .
establishing the mechanism of apoptotic induction by  xxxd3259xxx  and
its metabolites is an important step in understanding the potent chemoregressive activity of this drug in colonic adenomas. the results
presented in this paper provide direct evidence of a link between one
biochemical effect of  xxxd3259xxx  ( xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition) and the induction
of apoptosis by the drug. although it is possible, even likely, that
 xxxd3259xxx  affects more than one apoptotic pathway, we believe that we
have identified  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition as at least one of the biochemical
mechanisms of apoptotic activation by  xxxd3259xxx  and its metabolites.
chemopreventive drugs that maintain this erk inhibitory activity
may be more potent than those that have more transient effects.
