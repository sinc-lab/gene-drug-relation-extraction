abstract: the  xxxd2019xxx  hormone,  xxxd408xxx  [1,25(oh)2d3], binds with high affinity to
the nuclear  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr), which recruits its retinoid x receptor (rxr) heterodimeric partner
to recognize  xxxd2019xxx  responsive elements (vdres) in target genes. 1,25(oh)2d3 is known primarily as a
regulator of calcium, but it also controls phosphate (re)absorption at the intestine and kidney. fibroblast
growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced in osteoblasts that, like pth, lowers serum
phosphate by inhibiting renal reabsorption through npt2a/npt2c. real-time pcr and reporter gene transfection assays were used to probe vdr-mediated transcriptional control by 1,25(oh)2d3. reporter gene and
mammalian two-hybrid transfections, plus competitive receptor binding assays, were used to discover novel
vdr ligands. 1,25(oh)2d3 induces fgf23 78-fold in osteoblasts, and because fgf23 in turn represses
1,25(oh)2d3 synthesis, a reciprocal relationship is established, with fgf23 indirectly curtailing 1,25(oh)2d3mediated intestinal absorption and counterbalancing renal reabsorption of phosphate, thereby reversing hyperphosphatemia and preventing ectopic calcification. therefore, a 1,25(oh)2d3–fgf23 axis regulating phosphate is comparable in importance to the 1,25(oh)2d3–pth axis that regulates calcium. 1,25(oh)2d3 also
elicits regulation of lrp5, runx2,  xxxg1738xxx , trpv6, and npt2c, all anabolic toward bone, and rankl, which
is catabolic. regulation of mouse rankl by 1,25(oh)2d3 supports a cloverleaf model, whereby vdr-rxr
heterodimers bound to multiple vdres are juxtapositioned through chromatin looping to form a supercomplex, potentially allowing simultaneous interactions with multiple co-modulators and chromatin remodeling
enzymes. vdr also selectively binds certain ␻3/␻6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) with low affinity,
leading to transcriptionally active vdr-rxr complexes. moreover, the turmeric-derived polyphenol, curcumin, activates transcription of a vdre reporter construct in human colon cancer cells. activation of vdr
by pufas and curcumin may elicit unique, 1,25(oh)2d3-independent signaling pathways to orchestrate the
bioeffects of these lipids in intestine, bone, skin/hair follicle, and other vdr-containing tissues.

1,25(oh)2d3,(4,5) but phosphate homeostasis additionally
involves a newly recognized phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23), which is secreted by
osteoblasts to regulate phosphate and calcium metabolism
in a reciprocal manner to 1,25(oh)2d3.(6,7) elevated
1,25(oh)2d3 acts to promote expression of fgf23 in the
osteoblast(6,8) (fig. 1, bottom). fgf23 has dual actions to
(1) suppress phosphate reabsorption from the kidney filtrate and (2) to repress 1,25(oh)2d3 synthesis, thus closing
this endocrine regulatory loop. similarly, elevated ca+2 and
1,25(oh)2d3 negatively regulate pth synthesis (fig. 1,
top), a feedback that closes the loop comprising  xxxg1885xxx ,25(oh)2d3–elicited correction of hypocalcemia. added
to its role in controlling calcium and phosphate ion concentrations in the blood, the 1,25(oh)2d3–vdr complex also
controls the renal production of 1,25(oh)2d3 by feedback
regulatory loops (fig. 1, center), one of which entails the

fig. 1. calcium and phosphate homeostasis as mediated by 1,25(oh)2d3. feedback loops to control calcium, involving pth, and
phosphate, including the novel phosphaturic hormone fgf23, are explained in the text. targets of 1,25(oh)2d3-mediated gene
regulation probed in this study (white text on black background) include several anabolic factors for bone (runx2, lrp5, and
osteocalcin [oc]), the respective calcium and phosphate (re)absorbing gene products, trpv6 and npt2c, the osteoclast differentiating
factor rankl, and a gene involved in the curtailing of fgf23 levels,  xxxg1738xxx . the inset in the lower right displays the effect of
1,25(oh)2d3 treatment (10−7 m) on the levels of each mrna after 24 h as monitored by real-time pcr in the following cultured cell
lines: mg-63 for human oc and rankl; caco-2 for human trpv6 and npt2c; umr-106 for rat fgf23 and  xxxg1738xxx ; and mc3t3-e1
for mouse runx2 and lrp5. levels of mrna in each cell line are normalized against the unregulated  xxxg861xxx  control mrna, and
the fold effects of 1,25(oh)2d3 are expressed as mean ± se for three to four independent experiments with each experiment performed
in triplicate (n ⳱ 9–12). all mean values for induction or repression by 1,25(oh)2d3 are significantly different from vehicle controls
at p < 0.05.

feedback repression of pth. the latter point presents a
clue to the likely physiological role of fgf23 as a “long
acting pth” in preventing hyperphosphatemia when
1,25(oh)2d3 is in the process of correcting hypocalcemia.
because pth becomes suppressed rapidly during the action of 1,25(oh)2d3, the sterol hormone marshals a second
phosphaturic principle, fgf23, to ensure that phosphate is
eliminated while calcium is being acquired. this concept
explains the requirement for two phosphaturic hormones,
pth and fgf23, with the former repressed and the latter
induced by 1,25(oh)2d3.
a major focus of our current research is the characterization of vdr-regulated genes, particularly those supporting intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, including
the molecular mechanisms whereby vdr exerts this primary action, details of which only now are being appreciated. therefore, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of 1,25(oh)2d3–vdr signaling and associated
pathophysiology. what emerges is a more complete picture
of the contribution of vdr signaling to bone mineral homeostasis that involves (1) stimulation of intestinal calcium
and phosphate absorption to prevent rickets/osteomalacia,
(2) enhancement of bone remodeling through osteoblastinduced osteoclast maturation, and (3) regulation of novel
target genes involved in mineral homeostasis that possess

anabolic or catabolic activity in terms of their function in
either enhancing the formation or degradation of the mineralized skeleton. the 1,25(oh)2d3 ligand may also signal
through rapid plasma membrane or cytoplasmic target cell
actions that result in ca2+ influx, mapk stimulation, and
increased pkc activity, events that are either supportive of
the genomic functions of 1,25(oh)2d3–vdr or in some
cases independent.(9–13) because the major calcium and
bone actions of 1,25(oh)2d3 are ablated by inactivating
the dna binding function of vdr, the molecular details
and pathophysiologic significance of rapid actions of the
1,25(oh)2d3 hormone will require further elucidation.
vdr actions in noncalcemic tissues may, in some cases,
not involve the endocrine 1,25(oh)2d3 ligand. for example, hair cycling is greatly affected in vdr knockout
animals(14,15) and in many patients with hereditary hypocalcemic  xxxd2019xxx –resistant rickets type ii (hvdrrii),(16) although this process is not compromised in vitamin
d deficiency. in addition, the secondary bile acid, lithocholate, has been recently recognized as a bona fide vdr
ligand in the colon, capable of activating vdr to induce
detoxifying, cytochrome p450-containing enzymes.(17) accordingly, this study also seeks to characterize binding and
activation of vdr by novel ligands, including essential
 xxxd2154xxx  and their derivatives, and other nutritionally de-

rived beneficial lipids. these ligands might underlie or support vdr actions in skin, small intestine, and colon, not
only to promote normal differentiation and detoxification,
but also because they may possess value in cancer prevention in these and other epithelial tissues.

materials and methods
general procedure for transfecting cultured
mammalian cells
all cell lines in this study originated from atcc and
were maintained according to atcc guidelines. cells were
transfected in 24-well plates using lipofectamine transfection reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. each well received
250 ng of pluc-mcs plasmid (stratagene, la jolla, ca,
usa) containing two copies of a nuclear receptor responsive element upstream of the firefly (photinus pyralis) luciferase gene. the vdr element (vdre) used (designated xdr3) was the distal element from the human
cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 gene.(18) cells were also cotransfected with 50 ng of a psg5-based plasmid for expression of the appropriate nuclear receptor. a vector encoding
renilla luciferase (prl-null; 20 ng) was included in each
experiment to assess the efficiency of transfection and to
serve as an internal standard. the cells were treated with a
variety of known or potential ligands 18 h after transfection;
treatment times ranged from 24 to 30 h. after incubation
with ligand, cells were collected and analyzed using the
dual-luciferase reporter assay system (promega, madison, wi, usa) as described below. all data are reported as
either the average of two or more experiments or are representative of two or more independent experiments. each
experimental treatment group was replicated in at least
three, and often as many as six, wells.

mammalian two hybrid transfections
the cells were transfected with components of the mammalian two hybrid system from stratagene. retinoid x
receptor ␣ (rxr␣) and steroid receptor co-activator-1
( xxxg1510xxx ) were cloned into pcmv-bd (bait), and a human
vdr cdna was inserted into pcmv-ad (prey). each
well received 50 ng of bait and prey vectors along with 500
ng of pfr-luc, a firefly luciferase reporter construct, that
was also introduced into the cells.

analysis of transfected mammalian cells
the amount of reporter gene product (luciferase) produced in the transfected cells was measured using the dualluciferase reporter assay system from promega according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the mean ratio of firefly
luciferase to renilla luciferase signal was determined for
each experimental group, and the sd was calculated for the
replicates (usually three to six wells) using ms excel (expressed as error bars in figures).

competitive binding assays
cos-7 cells were transfected with vdr and rxr expression vectors followed by sonication and centrifugation

at 58,000 rpm at 4°c for 30 min. aliquots of supernatant (10
␮l) were mixed with 5 ␮l of 1,25(oh)2-26,27[3h]dimethyl-cholecalciferol (amersham, piscataway, nj, usa;
183 ci/mmol; final concentration ∼4.0 × 10−10 m and 51
ci/mmol). selections from a panel of known and putative
ligands were added to the resulting solution and allowed to
equilibrate with radiolabeled 1,25(oh)2d3 for 15 h. the
unbound 1,25(oh)2d3 was removed, and the samples were
analyzed using a beckman (fullerton, ca, usa) ls 5801
scintillation counter.

real-time pcr
total rna was isolated from the indicated cells (treated
with ligands for 24 h) using an acid guanidinium-phenolchloroform method (trizol reagent; invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by treatment with
dnase i (dna-free; ambion, austin, tx, usa). dnase
i–treated rna (2 ␮g) was reverse transcribed using modified mmlv-derived reverse transcriptase and random
hexamer primers (iscript cdna synthesis kit; biorad,
hercules, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the cdna synthesized was used as a template in 20
␮l pcr reactions containing 10 ␮l iq sybr green supermix (bio-rad), 1 ␮l primers, 2 ␮l cdna synthesis reaction,
and 7 ␮l molecular grade water. reactions were performed
in 96-well pcr plates and analyzed on a bio-rad icycler
iq real-time pcr detection system. data were analyzed
using the comparative ct method for relative quantitation;
all raw values were normalized to an endogenous reference
( xxxg861xxx  cdna) and compared with a calibrator (i.e., the
normalized ct value from vehicle-treated cells) and expressed as 2−⌬⌬ct according to applied biosystems user
bulletin 2: rev b, “relative quantitation of gene expression.”

results and discussion
as described in the introduction and fig. 1, we now have
a more complete understanding of the hormonal control of
phosphate and calcium, based on the recent discovery of
fgf23 as a new phosphaturic hormone that negatively controls renal 1,25(oh)2d3 biosynthesis and possibly bone
mineralization.(19) although fgf23 expression was originally localized to the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus of the
brain and thought to be undetectable in bone, more recent
data have shown that fgf23 mrna is expressed in osteoblasts.(6,20) the fgf23 protein is detected in mature osteoblasts,(21) and the fgf23 promoter has been shown to respond positively to 1,25(oh)2d3 in transfected ros 17/2.8
osteoblasts.(22) we showed through real-time pcr that endogenous fgf23 mrna is detectable both in cultured rat
umr-106 osteoblasts, where it is upregulated 78-fold by
1,25(oh)2d3 (fig. 1, inset at bottom right), and in mouse
bone, where it is strikingly upregulated by 1,25(oh)2d3
treatment.(6) concomitantly, fgf23 is elevated 80-fold in
the serum of 1,25(oh)2d3-injected mice.(6) therefore, we
propose that fgf23 is not only at least one component of
the long sought phosphatonin, but that it is an osteoblastic
phosphatonin upregulated by 1,25(oh)2d3 (as well as by
high phosphate, independently). aberrations in the fgf23
pathway result in hyper- and hypo-phosphatemic diseases

molecular action of vdr ligands
of bone mineral metabolism in which the fgf23 feedback
loop is either missing or dysregulated. for example,
fgf23-null mice have increased serum 1,25(oh)2d3, hyperphosphatemia, ectopic calcification in soft tissues, and
excessive mineralization of bone. in contrast, hypophosphatemic osteomalacia results from malignant cells that
constitutively express fgf23, and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by fgf23 mutations that
prevent its proteolytic inactivation. taken together, these
vital observations allow the construction of a “balanced”
mineral homeostasis scheme (fig. 1), in which renal
1,25(oh)2d3 is central and interplays with both pth for
calcemic control and fgf23 for phosphatemic control, with
the final result being the fine tuning of resorption and mineralization to maintain the functional skeleton.
another factor with implications for the 1,25(oh)2d3–
fgf23 axis is phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, x-linked ( xxxg1738xxx ).  xxxg1738xxx  is synthesized in osteoblasts
and participates in a complex cascade of protein degradation, the net effect of which is to reduce fgf23 synthesis
and thereby allow kidney phosphate reabsorption to continue.(23,24) the double knockout of  xxxg1738xxx  (hyp mouse)
and fgf23(25,26) shows that deletion of fgf23 reverses
the hyp phenotype of hypophosphatemia, inappropriately
low 1,25(oh)2d3, and rickets, further confirming the reciprocal relationship of these two factors. mutations in
 xxxg1738xxx  lead to the human disorder of x-linked hypophosphatemia ( xxxg1738xxx ).(7) like fgf23,  xxxg1738xxx  is also regulated by 1,25(oh)2d3, but its expression is repressed by the
 xxxd2019xxx  hormone.(20,27,28) we have shown this repression
of  xxxg1738xxx  by 58% after 1,25(oh)2d3 treatment of osteoblast-like cultured umr-106 cells (fig. 1, inset at bottom
right). thus, one key to calcium and phosphate homeostasis
is the interplay and feedback control of fgf23, pth, and
 xxxg1738xxx , with 1,25(oh)2d3 acting as the central integration
and signaling molecule to appropriately control the blood
levels of these ions.
not only do we theorize that 1,25(oh)2d3 is the master
integrator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis through
its cross-regulation of fgf23,  xxxg1738xxx , and pth, but also
that 1,25(oh)2d3 impacts the genesis of both osteoclasts
and osteoblasts, in part because of the regulation of key
genes. thus, in addition to 1,25(oh)2d3-mediated regulation of fgf23 and  xxxg1738xxx , several other genes have been
identified as targets for 1,25(oh)2d3 transcriptional control (fig. 1, white text on black ovals, and data inset at
bottom right). these genes can generally be classified as
anabolic or catabolic in terms of their function in either
enhancing the formation or degradation of the mineralized
skeleton. bone mineral anabolic genes that we have shown
to be regulated by 1,25(oh)2d3 (fig. 1, inset at lower right)
include (1) lrp5, the wnt co-receptor that is essential for
osteoblast proliferation and function, which is induced 6.6fold; (2) runx2,(29) an osteoblast-specific transcription factor that is absolutely required for bone formation, which is
repressed by 50%; (3) trpv6,(30) the intestinal epithelial
calcium channel that is vital for absorption of calcium required for proper bone mineralization, which is induced
4.9-fold; and (4) npt2c,(31) a renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter that facilitates the reabsorption of phosphate at

v5
the kidney, which is induced 4.7-fold. catabolic genes regulated by 1,25(oh)2d3 include pth, which is repressed by
1,25(oh)2d3,(32) and rankl, an osteoblast cell surface
protein that stimulates osteoclastogenesis, which is induced
4.8-fold (fig. 1, inset at bottom right). we hypothesize that
1,25(oh)2d3 is anabolic to bone in physiologic concentrations by inducing lrp5, trpv6, and npt2c, but in the
face of excess or sustained 1,25(oh)2d3, the hormone is
catabolic to bone by inducing rankl, repressing  xxxg1738xxx ,
and inducing fgf23 to elicit phosphaturia. excessive
1,25(oh)2d3 signaling may also delimit bone through repression of runx2 and induction of fgf23, which would
result in decreased bone formation and mineralization, respectively.
furthermore, we are in the process of elucidating, within
the context of bone mineral regulating tissues/cells, the molecular details of signaling events mediated by the
1,25(oh)2d3-liganded vdr in controlling these anabolic
and catabolic genes. although the precise mechanism
whereby liganded vdr regulates target gene transcription
has yet to be completely characterized, vdr can be considered a typical nuclear  xxxg1603xxx ,(33) comprised
of a dual zinc finger-based dna-binding domain (dbd),
nuclear localization signal(s), and a ligand-binding domain
(lbd) that binds the cognate ligands.(17) furthermore,
vdr is a member of the thyroid hormone,  xxxd3417xxx ,
oxycholesterol, and xenobiotic subfamily of nuclear receptors that primarily heterodimerizes with rxr in response
to 1,25(oh)2d3 binding to recognize direct repeat responsive elements in the promoters of regulated genes (fig. 2a,
steps 1 and 2).(34–36) previous research with vdr-activated
genes has indicated that many factors participate in transactivation.(1) these include the following (figs. 2a and 2c):
step 3, factors capable of histone acetylation (hats), such
as  xxxg1510xxx ,(37) cbp/p300, or  xxxg1227xxx , or of atp-dependent
chromatin remodeling, such as the mammalian homologs of
swi/snf(38); step 4, tata binding protein associated
factors (tafs, especially tafs 28, 55, and 135(39,40));
step 5, basal transcription factors such as tfiib(41); step 6,
d-receptor interacting proteins (drips, especially
 xxxg1396xxx , which is  xxxg220xxx  of the mediator complex that
couples transactivators to the c-terminal tail of rna polymerase ii)(42); and step 7, ncoa-62, a factor reported to
serve as a co-activator for vdr and related nuclear receptors that seems to couple transcription to rna splicing.(43)
step 8, interaction with trip1, the mammalian homolog of
the yeast sug factor, results in progressive ubiquitination
of vdr and ultimately leads to its recognition and degradation by the proteasome.(44) many of these co-factors interact with a common region of vdr, namely the cterminal af-2 motif(1); thus, it is difficult to conceive of
these factors all interacting with vdr to effect transactivation except in a sequential manner (fig. 2a) or in a complex in which multiple vdr-rxr heterodimers are present (fig. 2c).
the rankl gene promoter (fig. 2b) is being used as a
model system for studying the steps in transcriptional activation by the liganded vdr-rxr heterodimer using in
silico analysis as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation
(chip), gel mobility shift, and transcription assays. based

vdr-rxr heterodimer. numbers inside circles refer to discreet
stages in the activation of a vdr target gene as discussed in the
text. (b) the presence of several potential vdres in the 5⬘ flanking region of the mouse rankl gene, as reported by kim et
al.(46) and verified by our experiments (data not shown). (c) how
these vdres might cooperate in a chromatin-looping model. as
discussed in the text, multiple vdr-rxr heterodimers may be
capable of simultaneously recruiting co-activators and other factors (pictured are the factors from the numbered stages of a) to
form a regulatory supercomplex at the promoter.

on our studies(45) and those of kim et al.,(46) fig. 2c depicts
a postulated chromatin looping model for the mouse
rankl gene. instead of separate events in which various
factors bind to a single vdr-rxr heterodimer in a de-

jurutka et al.
fined sequence (fig. 2a),(1) we propose that the chromatin
looping model (fig. 2c) allows for simultaneous binding of
multiple factors in a supercomplex at the promoter.
most evidence for a chromatin-looping model in transcriptional control is derived from studies of the globin
genes(47) and the t-helper type 2 cytokine locus.(48) there
is also direct evidence for such looping in transactivation by
nuclear receptors. multiple binding sites for the estrogen
receptor have been reported flanking single genes, some as
far as 144 kb from the transcriptional start site (tss).(49)
chromosomal looping has also been postulated for androgen-dependent transcription.(50) although direct evidence
for chromosomal looping in vdr-mediated transcriptional
modulation is not yet available, there are data that multiple,
active vdres are located at considerable distances from
the tss in 1,25(oh)2d3 target genes. recent results from
kim et al. using chip-chip and other techniques, as well as
recent data from our laboratory using in silico, chip, gel
mobility shift, and transcription analyses (data not shown),
have provided evidence for active vdres located anywhere from 76 kb upstream in the rankl gene(46) (fig.
2b) to 19–29 kb downstream (within the first two introns) in
the mouse lrp5(45,51) and vdr(52) genes, as well as 2–4 kb
upstream of the trpv6 gene.(30,45) it therefore seems
likely that nuclear receptors, including vdr, also use chromosomal looping in their mechanism of transactivation, at
least in some settings.
the existence of multiple enhancer elements, some of
varying strengths, may provide an explanation for hitherto
unresolved phenomena. for example, the dramatically different patterns of 1,25(oh)2d3-dependent regulation for
the rankl and opg genes observed in different cell lines
can perhaps be attributed to differing abilities to form the
chromatin looping complex suggested by fig. 2c. this is an
especially attractive hypothesis if, for example, the complex
requires factors other than vdr and rxr that are limiting
in certain cell lines. the time that may be required to form
such complexes might also explain why, for many hormones, there is a distinctly different regulatory result when
the hormone is chronically present versus situations in
which there is an acute spike in hormone concentration.
there is additional evidence, in the case of vdr-mediated
regulation of rankl, that overexpressing vdr in osteoblasts can eliminate or even reverse the induction of
rankl by 1,25(oh)2d3.(53) one could speculate that
high concentrations of vdr might lead to formation of
supercomplexes in which low-affinity vdres might attract
co-repressors rather than co-activators. further characterization of the multiple potential vdres at the rankl
locus will be required to obtain a complete picture of the
complex regulation of rankl by 1,25(oh)2d3-bound
vdr, and the current working model depicted in fig. 2c
may serve as a paradigm for other 1,25(oh)2d3–vdr
regulated genes that contain multiple vdres with differential vdr binding affinity.
in addition to the role of vdr in bone mineral homeostasis, evolutionary considerations indicate that vdr predates mineralized tissue and hair in vertebrates.(54) moreover, vdr is closely related to  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx )
and  xxxg1599xxx  (car), which induce

enzymes that detoxify xenobiotics, and to  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr), the bile acid sensor.(1) it is therefore not
surprising that vdr also likely functions as a low-affinity
sensor for detoxification in certain tissues such as the colon,
where vdr has already been shown to bind the carcinogenic secondary bile acid, lithocholate.(17) the vdr is also
absolutely required for a functional hair cycle as exemplified by the known phenotype of alopecia in hvddr-ii
patients(16) and in vdr knockout mice.(14,15) furthermore,
essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) deficiency has
adverse effects on skin, including impaired hair growth and
dermatitis.(55–58) administration of pufas such as linoleic
acid has been shown to reverse these symptoms.(57,58) intriguingly, the skin phenotype in vdr knockout mice resembles pufa deficiency, strongly suggesting that vdr
plays an important role in the health of skin and hair.(14)
the notion that vdr could have additional ligands is supported by the aforementioned identification of lithocholate
(fig. 3a, “l”) as a bona fide, low-affinity vdr ligand.(17)
thus, novel vdr ligands, likely related to pufas, may be
important for vdr actions in the skin.
along with pufas, a variety of other compounds listed
in fig. 3a were tested as potential vdr ligands. figure 3b
presents results of a mammalian two hybrid assay performed in human embryonic kidney-293 (hek-293) cells to
evaluate ligand-induced association between vdr and
rxr. figure 3b shows that all of the tested pufas significantly induced vdr-rxr heterodimerization (6- to 13fold). in addition, all pufas tested significantly activated
vdre-mediated transcription in hek-293 cells transfected with a vdre reporter construct (data not shown).
moreover, these findings were consistent with the results of
mammalian two hybrid assays performed in human colon
cancer (caco-2) and osteoblast-like rat osteosarcoma cells
(ros 17/2.8), and vdre-mediated transcription was also
activated by pufas in human osteosarcoma cells (te-85,
data not shown). thus, pufas facilitate vdr-rxr heterodimerization and activate vdr-mediated transactivation in renal, intestinal, and skeletal cells. importantly, at
similar concentrations, other compounds, including ligands
of  xxxg1598xxx , the receptor evolutionarily closest to vdr, failed
to stimulate interactions between vdr and rxr (fig. 3b,
right half of panel), thus excluding the possibility that high
levels of any small lipophilic molecule can nonspecifically
activate vdr.(59,60)
another compound evaluated as a potential vdr ligand
is the turmeric-derived polyphenol, curcumin (fig. 3a,
“cm”). chemoprevention by cm has been documented in
the intestine and skin, two major vdr target tissues.(61)
there is also evidence that cm potentiates 1,25(oh)2d3stimulated differentiation in human leukemia cells (hl60).(62) therefore, we hypothesized that vdr may be a
direct mediator of curcumin bioactions. figure 3c shows
the results of an experiment performed in human colon
cancer cells (caco-2) transfected with a vdre-containing
reporter plasmid. cells treated with 6.7 × 10−6 and 10−5 m
cm showed a dose-dependent increase (2.1- and 5.0-fold,
respectively) in the level of transcription of the reporter
plasmid, the latter of which is comparable to stimulations
by 10−8 m 1,25(oh)2d3 and 10−4 m lithocholate (l); cm

jurutka et al.
also facilitates vdr-rxr heterodimerization in a mammalian two hybrid system (caco-2 cells; data not shown)
similar to the actions of pufas depicted in fig. 3b. some
of the tested compounds (fig. 3a) also stimulated rxrmediated transcription, but neither pufas nor cm activated the  xxxg1601xxx  to a significant extent,
indicating a specific effect on vdr and/or rxr. to show
that curcumin can bind directly to vdr and does not activate transcription solely by binding to rxr or some other
co-factor, in vitro competition vdr-binding assays were
performed. as shown in fig. 3d, cm successfully competed
with radiolabeled 1,25(oh)2d3 for binding to overexpressed vdr present in a cos-7 cellular extract.  xxxd1891xxx −4
m, cm effectively competed >50% of the amount of radiolabeled 1,25(oh)2d3 bound to vdr compared with negligible competition by 10−4 m dex, a lipophilic ligand without appreciable binding to vdr. lithocholate was included
for comparison with cm and was only slightly more effective than cm in competing with 1,25(oh)2d3 for vdr
binding. the pufas evaluated in this study were likewise
capable of competing with labeled 1,25(oh)2d3 for binding
to vdr (data not shown), indicating that both pufas and
curcumin represent low affinity activating ligands of vdr,
effective in concentrations that, like lithocholate, actually
occur naturally at select vdr targets such as colon and
skin.
overall, these new findings indicate that cm and pufas
not only directly bind to vdr, but also induce rxr recruitment and activate transcription through a vdre. the
evidence presented herein supports the hypothesis that curcumin and pufas are bona fide ligands for vdr and suggest that at least some of their bioeffects, particularly in the
colon and skin, are mediated by this nuclear receptor. because all tested pufas activate vdr at very high concentrations, it is possible that a specific pufa metabolite generated enzymatically in a select vdr target site, such as the
hair follicle, is a high-affinity vdr ligand that actually functions to drive the mammalian hair cycle through vdr mediation of transcriptional control. in addition, these observations provide a novel explanation for beneficial effects of
certain pufas on bone, which may result from direct activation of vdr.(63) thus, this study implicates vdr as a
sensor of circulating essential  xxxd2154xxx  and other beneficial dietary lipids, such as curcumin.
the complete spectrum of vdr bioactions is therefore
expanding to include responses to the presence of alternative lipophilic ligands to effect 1,25(oh)2d3-independent
actions in nontraditional target tissues, with likely implications for nutritional and pharmacological interventions to
promote epithelial tissue health and potential cancer prevention. as for the mechanisms by which the liganded
vdr-rxr heterodimer influences gene transcription, we
are beginning to appreciate the true complexity of these
actions at a single promoter, which in many cases seems to
involve multiple, widely separated vdres that may cooperate in ways that remain to be elucidated. this complexity,
combined with the likelihood of many alternative (and
largely uncharacterized) mechanisms for negative regulation of transcription by liganded vdr, underscores the
need for further elucidation of vdr signaling to reveal the

molecular action of vdr ligands
full repertoire of this intriguing nuclear  xxxg1603xxx 
and its array of physiologically and pharmacologically relevant ligands.
