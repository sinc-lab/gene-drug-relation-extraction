we investigated the effects of the aldosterone blocker  xxxd2010xxx  alone and in combination
with  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibition on ventricular remodeling in rats with
left ventricular (lv) dysfunction after extensive myocardial infarction (mi).
background adding an aldosterone antagonist to ace inhibition reduces mortality and morbidity in
heart failure.
methods
starting 10 days after mi, rats were treated with placebo,  xxxd2010xxx  (100 mg/kg/day), the
ace inhibitor  xxxd3409xxx  (0.3 mg/kg/day), or a combination of both for nine weeks.
results
both monotherapies attenuated the rise in lv end-diastolic pressure (lvedp) and lv
end-diastolic volume (lvedv) compared with placebo, whereas combined treatment further
attenuated lvedp and lvedv, significantly improved lv function and reduced plasma
norepinephrine levels. the time constant of lv pressure isovolumic decay (␶) was prolonged
in placebo mi rats, significantly shortened by  xxxd2010xxx , and normalized by  xxxd2010xxx /
 xxxd3409xxx . increased collagen type i gene expression and collagen content in the noninfarcted lv myocardium from mi placebo rats was attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx , but almost
completely prevented by  xxxd2010xxx  and  xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx . the addition of  xxxd2010xxx 
to ace inhibition prevented sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium atpase downregulation and
the increases in lv gene expression of ␤-mhc and atrial natriuretic factor more effectively
than either monotherapy. furthermore, combination treatment attenuated the increase in
myocardial  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor expression and increased phosphorylated endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase protein levels.
conclusions the aldosterone blocker  xxxd2010xxx  improved lv remodeling in rats with lv dysfunction
after extensive mi. combination therapy with an ace inhibitor substantially potentiates this
effect by a complementary prevention of lv fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and molecular
alterations. (j am coll cardiol 2003;42:1666 –73) © 2003 by the american college of

objectives

left ventricular (lv) remodeling after myocardial infarction
(mi) involves myocyte hypertrophy, chamber dilation, and
increased collagen accumulation remote from the infarct
site, leading to impaired contractile function and heart
failure (1,2).
see page 1674
aldosterone production in the heart (3,4) as well as
aldosterone plasma levels (5–7) are increased after mi and
in congestive heart failure (chf), correlating with the
severity of disease. moreover, despite complete vascular
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibition, plasma
aldosterone levels are elevated in chf patients, suggesting

 xxxg99xxx -independent aldosterone production (8). aldosterone may contribute to the progression of ventricular
remodeling by promoting sodium and water retention,
sympathoadrenergic activation, endothelial dysfunction, and
vascular and myocardial fibrosis (9 –13).
 xxxg1602xxx  blockade (for four weeks, started
early [14] or seven days [3] after mi) reduced fibrosis in the
viable myocardium of rats with moderate mi. moreover,
long-term monotherapy with  xxxd2010xxx , a novel aldosterone blocker, prevented progressive lv dysfunction and
remodeling in dogs with moderate heart failure (15). the
randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study (rales)
showed that the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist spironolactone added to ace inhibition reduces morbidity and
mortality among patients with severe heart failure (16). post
hoc substudies of the rales and subsequent smaller trials
in postinfarction patients reported a decrease in serum
markers for cardiac collagen synthesis and a reduction of lv
dilation (17–19). however, the role of aldosterone in
addition to ace inhibition in the pathophysiology of
postinfarction ventricular remodeling is still uncertain.
in the present study, we investigated the effects of

in rats with lv dysfunction after extensive mi.

methods
all procedures conformed to the guiding principles of the
american physiological society and were approved by the
institutional animal research committee.
mi and study protocols. left coronary artery ligations
were performed in adult male wistar rats (200 to 250 g) (7).
briefly, under ether anesthesia, the thorax was opened, the
heart exteriorized, and a ligature was placed around the
proximal left coronary artery. the heart was returned to its
normal position, and the thorax was closed. mortality was
46% within the first 24 h. sham-operated control rats
underwent the same surgical procedure except that the
suture around the coronary artery was not tied. starting on
the tenth postoperative day, sham-operated animals received placebo treatment, and surviving mi rats were
randomly allocated to one of the following four treatment
groups: placebo, the aldosterone blocker  xxxd2010xxx , the
ace inhibitor  xxxd3409xxx , or a combination of  xxxd2010xxx 
and  xxxd3409xxx  for nine weeks.  xxxd2010xxx  was given in
food, and  xxxd3409xxx  was administered by gavage once
daily. the dose of  xxxd2010xxx  (100 mg/kg/day) was selected
from previous studies in which  xxxd2010xxx  provided marked
end-organ protective effects in the heart and kidney of
hypertensive rats (20).  xxxd3409xxx  was used at a dose of 0.3
mg/kg/day, which is the most commonly used dose for this
drug in rats with heart failure (7,11).

hemodynamic and lv volume measurements. left ventricular systolic pressure, lv end-diastolic pressure
(lvedp), mean arterial pressure, maximal rate of pressure
rise and decline (dp/dtmax and dp/dtmin, respectively), and
heart rate were measured 10 weeks after mi, under pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). saline-filled catheters (polyethylene-50) were advanced from the right carotid artery into the lv and
connected via a three-way stopcock to a millar micromanometer and statham transducer. the time constant of lv
pressure isovolumic decay (regression of log [pressure] vs.
time) was calculated by the weiss method (21). correlation
coefficients for all studies were ⱖ0.99. the in vivo lv
pressure-volume relationship was analyzed using a conductance catheter (spr-774, millar instruments, houston,
texas). the 1.4 f catheter was advanced from the right
carotid artery into the lv through the polyethylene-50,
saline-filled catheter after hemodynamic measurements.
pressure-volume signals were acquired by biobench software (national instruments, austin, texas). pvan software
(millar instruments) was used to analyze all pressurevolume loop data recorded at steady-state and during
injection of hypertonic saline for the calibration of parallel
conductance volume (22). the lv volume was calculated
for each rat from conductance volume corrected by the
relative parallel conductance volume.
sample collection, infarct size. the right ventricle (rv)
and the lv, including septum, were separated in ice-cold
saline and weighed. infarct size was quantified histologically
by planimetry. the lv was cut into three transverse
sections: apex, middle ring (⬃3 mm), and base. from the
middle ring, 5-␮m sections were cut at 100-␮m intervals
and stained with picrosirius red. infarct size (fraction of the
infarcted lv) was calculated as the average of all slices and
expressed as a percentage of length. only rats with extensive
infarcts (⬎45%) were included in the study.
neurohormonal assay. after hemodynamic measurement,
a blood sample was collected from the right carotid artery.
plasma norepinephrine was measured with highperformance liquid chromatography, and n-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (nt-proanp) was measured by
radioimmunoassay (immunodiagnostik, bensheim, germany).
quantification of cardiac gene expression. total ribonucleic acid was isolated from lv samples (noninfarcted
lv myocardium) using trizol reagent (invitrogen,
karlsruhe, germany). atrial natriuretic factor (anf), collagen
␣1(i), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase
( xxxg861xxx ) gene expression were determined by competitive
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as described (7). heterologous internal standards were constructed with a competitive dna pcr kit (takara, shiga, japan). products
of pcr amplification were separated on 2% agarose gel. a
given messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) level was expressed as a ratio with respect to the level of mrna for
 xxxg861xxx . ␣- and ␤-myosin heavy chain (mhc) mrna
was amplified by pcr as previously described (7). after

digestion with the restriction enzyme tru9i, fragments of
the pcr amplification product were separated on 8%
polyacrylamide gel.
myocardial hydroxyproline. for hydroxyproline determination, lv samples (noninfarcted lv myocardium) were
freeze-dried, weighed, and hydrolyzed in 6n hcl at 110°c
for 24 h. hydroxyproline concentration was measured
spectrophotometrically, and collagen content was expressed
in ␮g/mg dry tissue weight assuming that collagen contains
an average of 13.4% in hydroxyproline (7).
western blot analysis. the lv samples (noninfarcted lv
myocardium) were homogenized in ice-cold ripa buffer
(150 mmol/l nacl, 50 mmol/l tris-cl, 5 mmol/l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% v/v nonidet p-40, 0.5% w/v
 xxxd1835xxx , 10 mmol/l naf, 10 mmol/l sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2
␮g/ml aprotinin, and 2 ␮g/ml leopeptin). proteins were
determined by bradford assay. myocardial extracts (30 ␮g
protein per lane) were mixed with sample loading buffer and
under reducing conditions separated on 10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel. proteins were electrotransferred overnight at 4°c onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (immun-blot, bio-rad, münchen, germany).
the bands were detected using chemiluminescence assay
(ecl⫹plus, amersham, freiburg, germany). primary antibodies used recognize the following: matrix metalloproteinase 13 ( xxxg1422xxx ) (mab-13426, chemicon international, hofheim, germany);  xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at1)
receptor (sc-579, santa cruz biotechnology, heidelberg,
germany); sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium adenosine
triphosphatase (serca2 atpase; ma3-919, affinity
bioreagents, alexis biochemicals, grunberg, germany);
endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) (n-30020, transduction laboratories, bd biosciences, heidelberg, germany); and phosphorylated enos at ser1177 (9571, cell
signaling technology, frankfurt, germany).

statistical analysis. the main effects of the drug were
tested by two-factor analysis of variance (anova) for
repeated measures, and differences between the groups were
assessed by one-factor anova with post hoc comparisons
by the fisher protected least significant difference test.
statistical analysis was performed using the superanova
statistic program (abacus concepts, california). statistical
significance was assumed at p ⬍ 0.05. relationships between two variables were tested by linear regression analysis.

results
global parameters. infarct size and body weight were
similar among the experimental groups (table 1). the lv
weight and lv weight/body weight were reduced in the
 xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx -treated mi group compared with
placebo. the rv weight and rv weight/body weight were
markedly higher in placebo-treated mi rats compared with
sham-operated control rats and were significantly reduced
by both monotherapies. combination therapy led to a
significant further decrease in rv compared with monotherapy with either  xxxd2010xxx  or  xxxd3409xxx  (table 1).
hemodynamics and lv remodeling. mean arterial pressure and lv systolic pressure were reduced in all mi groups
irrespective of treatment (table 1). the mi rats on placebo
developed elevated lvedp and a markedly lower dp/dtmax
and dp/dtmin. monotherapy with  xxxd2010xxx  or  xxxd3409xxx 
attenuated lvedp and tended to enhance dp/dtmax and
dp/dtmin, whereas combined treatment further prevented
the rise in lvedp and significantly improved dp/dt (table
1). the time constant of lv pressure isovolumic decay (␶)
was prolonged in placebo mi rats, attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx , significantly shortened by  xxxd2010xxx , and normalized
by  xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx  (fig. 1a). myocardial infarction
resulted in a rightward shift of the lv pressure-volume
loops to high volumes (fig. 1b).  xxxd2010xxx  and trandola-

 xxxd1989xxx  prevented the rightward shift of lv volume and
significantly attenuated the lv end-diastolic volume
(lvedv) compared with placebo. however, combination
therapy led to a substantial further leftward shift of the lv
pressure-volume curve and a decrease in lvedv compared
with monotherapies. the lv ejection fraction was lower in
placebo mi rats compared with control rats (30 ⫾ 2% vs. 69

the  xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx -treated mi group (42 ⫾ 3%, p

nt-proanp and norepinephrine. myocardial infarction
was characterized by a marked increase in circulating ntproanp and norepinephrine levels (table 1). the ntproanp levels tended to be reduced by  xxxd2010xxx  (p ⫽
0.11) and were significantly decreased by  xxxd3409xxx . however, combination therapy significantly further attenuated
plasma nt-proanp concentrations compared with monotherapies. the increase in plasma norepinephrine levels was
attenuated by  xxxd2010xxx  (p ⫽ 0.06) and  xxxd3409xxx  (p ⫽

lv fetal gene expression. the ratio of lv ␤-mhc to
␣-mhc mrna and anf gene expression, molecular
markers of hypertrophy, were substantially increased in
placebo mi rats and attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx  and, to a
lesser degree, by  xxxd2010xxx  monotherapy.  xxxd2010xxx /
 xxxd3409xxx  treatment led to an additional attenuation of
cardiac ␤-mhc and anf mrnas (fig. 2).
lv fibrosis. the lv collagen concentrations were increased in placebo mi rats, attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx , and
nearly normalized by  xxxd2010xxx  and  xxxd2010xxx /
 xxxd3409xxx  (fig. 3). the rise in collagen type i gene
expression in the noninfarcted lv myocardium from mi
placebo rats was attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx  but almost
completely prevented by  xxxd2010xxx  and  xxxd2010xxx /

significantly prevented only by combination therapy (fig.

rats was attenuated by  xxxd3409xxx  and completely prevented by  xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx . the serca2 atpase

resulted in a significant enos phosphorylation at ser1176 in
mi rats (fig. 4).

discussion
our study shows improvement of lv remodeling by longterm  xxxg1602xxx  antagonism in rats with severe lv
dysfunction after extensive mi. we suppose that the favorable effects of  xxxd2010xxx  were likely mediated in part by the
reduction of lv fibrosis in the remote noninfarcted myocardium, a major determinant of ventricular remodeling in
ischemic cardiomyopathy (2). alterations in the collagen
matrix impair myocyte relengthening, leading to relaxation
abnormalities, progressive diastolic dysfunction, and heart
failure (2,13). in patients with hypertensive heart disease,
regression of myocardial fibrosis was associated with improvement of lv relaxation (23). in dogs with moderate
heart failure, suzuki et al. recently reported that  xxxd2010xxx 
reduced interstitial fibrosis and improved ventricular func-

tion (15). thus, the beneficial effects on isovolumetric
relaxation by  xxxd2010xxx  might partly be due to the prevention of collagen deposition in the remote lv myocardium.
limitation of the aldosterone-related excessive collagen
synthesis may be one of the various extrarenal mechanisms
contributing to the clinical benefit of spironolactone in the
rales trial (17). in fact, serum markers for cardiac
collagen synthesis were associated with poor outcome in
chf patients and were decreased by spironolactone therapy. moreover, the reduction of  xxxg1422xxx  could account for
the improvement of lv remodeling. indeed, upregulation
of mmps results in increased deposition of poorly structured fibrotic tissue in the myocardium and contributes to
the development of progressive ventricular dilation and
failure (24). locally produced or circulating aldosterone
stimulates cardiac fibrosis either directly via mineralocorticoid receptors or indirectly by interfering with at1 receptors (13,25). in addition, involvement of other factors has
been implicated in aldosterone-induced myocardial fibrosis
such as endothelin (26), bradykinin (27), and calcium (28).

may contribute to decreased cardiac fibrosis, similar to
observations in aldosterone-salt-treated rats, where spironolactone attenuated the upregulation of cardiac  xxxg100xxx 
(25).
the beneficial effects of long-term  xxxd2010xxx  treatment
on lv remodeling were probably also related to the prevention of pathologic hypertrophy, as shown by the reduction of fetal genes such as ␤-mhc and anf. recent
evidence that targeted overexpression of human  xxxg1602xxx  resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy and
increased cardiac anf expression supports our hypothesis
(29). experimental animal data suggest a role for aldosterone in mediating cardiac hypertrophy.  xxxg1602xxx  blockade attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in dogs with
chf (15) and in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive

rats (30). in rats harboring the human renin and  xxxg99xxx  genes, aldosterone antagonism, like  xxxg100xxx  inhibition, reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis,
suggesting that  xxxg99xxx -induced end-organ damage
might arise via aldosterone-related mechanisms (31). however, the mechanisms underlying aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy are not completely understood. increased
 xxxg100xxx  expression as well as calcineurin activity
caused by aldosterone may play a role (32).
additive effects of combination therapy with ace inhibitor and  xxxd2010xxx . several studies have shown that
monotherapy with ace inhibitors after mi improved lv
loading conditions, remodeling, and neurohormonal activation, as confirmed in the present study (33). however, ace
inhibition combined with aldosterone antagonism provided
additional beneficial effects on lv hemodynamics and
remodeling. this may be related to the observation of
complementary effects on lv fibrosis and hypertrophy of
the respective monotherapies: although  xxxd2010xxx  was
superior to ace inhibition in reducing lv fibrosis, ace
inhibition had a greater effect on fetal gene expression and
serca2 atpase protein levels. therefore, aldosterone
receptor and ace inhibition might be a particularly favorable combination regarding their action profile.
combination therapy improved lv contractile function
and both the load-dependent (dp/dt min) and loadindependent (␶) indices of lv relaxation (34,35). because
serca2 atpase downregulation in hypertrophied and/or
failing myocardium is linked to systolic and diastolic dysfunction (36), the improved cardiac function by combined
therapy might partly be due to prevention of serca2
atpase downregulation. in rats with heart failure,
serca2 atpase gene transfer improved not only contractile function but also survival, cardiac energetics, and remodeling (37), suggesting that impaired serca2 atpase
function represents a key mechanism linking deleterious

effects of the upregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system post mi to contractile dysfunction, hypertrophy, and
heart failure. moreover, the favorable functional effects of
beta-blockers in chf patients are related to serca
atpase upregulation (38).
combination therapy particularly increased myocardial
phosphorylated enos protein levels. phosphorylation of
enos activates the enzyme leading to  xxxd2738xxx  production (39). the pivotal role of enos for lv remodeling after
mi was recently demonstrated in enos knockout mice that
exhibited excessive lv dysfunction, hypertrophy, and dilation (40). furthermore, in these mice, the beneficial effects
of ace inhibitor and at1 antagonist therapy on lv
remodeling were substantially attenuated (41), suggesting
that an increase in cardiac enos activity contributes to the
cardioprotective effects of various established pharmacologic
interventions. the addition of spironolactone to ace
inhibitor therapy in rats with heart failure after mi particularly increased the bioavailability of endothelium-derived
 xxxd2738xxx  associated with reduced superoxide anion formation (11). the impact of oxidative stress on lv remodeling after mi has been convincingly demonstrated in recent
studies (42). as  xxxd2010xxx  reduces superoxide formation
(43), a beneficial shift in the balance of  xxxd2738xxx  and
superoxide may have improved cardiac performance and
remodeling.
the reduction in plasma norepinephrine may have contributed to more benefit of combination therapy by preventing the adverse cardiovascular effects of excessive sympathetic stimulation. because in post-mi rats the anf system
(44) is activated in relation to the increase in intracardiac
pressures, in the treated groups hemodynamic improvement
and prevention of cardiac failure likely accounted for the
reduction of atrial natriuretic peptide. results from the
rales neurohormonal substudy (45) and of tsutamoto et
al. (18) also showed decreased circulating levels of natriuretic peptides in patients with severe chf after spironolactone treatment.
clinical implications. although smaller trials in postinfarction patients and post hoc substudies of the rales
trial reported a reduction in lv dilation and a decrease in
myocardial collagen synthesis after spironolactone therapy
(17–19), our results provide important new insights into the
potential mechanisms underlying cardioprotection by aldosterone antagonism combined with ace inhibition.
study limitations. similar to previous observations in placebo rats with extensive mi, arterial pressure was lowered
(42) without an additional hypotensive effect of the pharmacologic intervention. as we did not assess changes in
systemic vascular resistance, it remains unclear from this
study whether the more favorable effects of combined
treatment were achieved in part by afterload reduction.
furthermore, we did not evaluate the lv end-systolic
pressure-volume relationships at different loading conditions. thus, future experiments should elucidate the effects
of  xxxd2010xxx  and  xxxd2010xxx / xxxd3409xxx  on the inotropic

state under acutely changing conditions independent of
end-diastolic volume and the systolic pressure. finally, the
employed post hoc fisher protected least significant difference test is limited to exert a real control for multiple
comparisons.
in summary,  xxxg1602xxx  blockade with
 xxxd2010xxx  improved lv remodeling in rats with lv
dysfunction after extensive mi. combination therapy with
an ace inhibitor substantially potentiated this effect.
complementary prevention of neurohormonal activation,
cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy appear to contribute to these beneficial effects.
