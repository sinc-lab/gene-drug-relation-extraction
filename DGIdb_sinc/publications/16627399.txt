therapeutic options in development
for management of diabetes:
pharmacologic agents and new technologies
harold e. lebovitz, md, face

abstract

introduction

objective: to review new pharmacologic therapies
and technologies relevant to the management of diabetes
and its complications.
methods: new treatment options for diabetes, made
available through research efforts during the past 2
decades, are discussed.
results: several new drugs and drug classes for the
management of diabetes are under development, including
the incretin mimetic agents (exenatide,  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors, and  xxxg873xxx  analogues),
the amylin analogue  xxxd2994xxx , the cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist rimonabant, the mixed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists muraglitazar and
tesaglitazar, the inhaled insulin preparation exubera, and
the insulin analogues ( xxxd2363xxx  and insulin
 xxxd2361xxx ).
conclusion: new drugs and technologic advances
being made available will help achieve the goals of treating patients with diabetes to all the appropriate metabolic
targets. many other agents that act on fundamental abnormalities such as energy imbalance, inflammation, and vascular biologic conditions are in very early stages of development but are likely to become available during the next
5 to 10 years. (endocr pract. 2006;12[suppl 1]: 142147)

basic research during the past 2 decades has provided
the foundation for the development of numerous new
pharmacologic agents and technologies for the treatment
of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and the components
of the metabolic syndrome. the appropriate use of these
new treatments alone or in combination with previously
available agents will provide additional means for achieving target metabolic goals. the newer agents that either
have recently been approved for clinical use or have completed phase 3 studies and are currently being reviewed by
the us food and drug administration (fda) are the
incretin mimetic agent exenatide, the amylin analogue
 xxxd2994xxx , the alpha cannabinoid-1 (cb1) receptor
antagonist rimonabant, the mixed peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar) agonist muraglitazar, the
inhaled insulin exubera, and the insulin analogues glulisine and  xxxd2361xxx  insulin.

exenatide
it had been known for 40 years that substances
released from the gastrointestinal tract during nutrient
ingestion potentiate glucose-mediated insulin secretion
and improve nutrient metabolism. these substances were
given the name incretins. two incretins were isolated, gastric inhibitory polypeptide and  xxxg873xxx 
(glp-1), and their effects in both normal subjects and
patients with diabetes were extensively investigated (1).
patients with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the actions of
gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and it appears to have little
or no pharmacologic value in these subjects. in contrast,
glp-1 secretion is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes, and the administration of glp-1 to such patients
results in profound metabolic effects, as listed in table 1
(1). the consequences of glp-1 actions are that hyperglycemia related to ingestion of nutrients results in greater
release of insulin and greater suppression of glucagon than
would occur from the hyperglycemia alone. these actions
have a salutary effect in reducing postprandial glucose
excursions (1). when the plasma glucose level is in the
normal fasting range or is low, however, glp-1 has no
effect on either insulin or glucagon secretion; thus, the

(demonstrated in animal models but not yet in
humans)

metabolic responses to a low blood glucose level are maintained, and the person is protected from hypoglycemia (1).
the delay in gastric emptying facilitates reduction of the
postprandial glucose excursions, and the satiety effects
help to keep caloric intake from being excessive.
currently, whether glp-1 influences beta cell mass in
normal subjects or in patients with diabetes is unclear.
after being secreted, glp-1 is very rapidly degraded
in the plasma by the enzyme  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ), which cleaves the n-terminal 2 amino acids (1). the
replacement or pharmacologic administration of native
glp-1 must be given by continuous intravenous infusion
if it is to be effective. the development of effective  xxxg873xxx  therapies has necessitated modifying the molecule to
make it resistant to dpp-4 degradation (as in  xxxd2495xxx ),
finding a naturally occurring molecule that binds to and
activates the  xxxg899xxx  yet is structurally different
enough to resist dpp-4 degradation (exenatide), or creating molecules that inhibit the dpp-4 enzyme ( xxxd3510xxx )
(1).

exenatide is a synthetic 39-amino acid peptide that is
structurally identical to native  xxxd2076xxx , which is found
in the saliva of a desert lizard (gila monster) indigenous to
the southwestern united states. its  xxxg899xxx  binding is equivalent to that of native glp-1 (2). it is resistant
to inactivation by dpp-4. moreover, it is rapidly absorbed
after subcutaneous injection, and its duration of action is 6
hours (2).
the usual dose of exenatide is 5 to 10 mug given with
breakfast and the evening meal. a dose of exenatide
administered before a meal in patients with type 2 diabetes
dramatically reduces the postprandial glucose excursion.
three large phase 3 trials (amigo studies) examined the
effects of adding exenatide to the treatment of patients
with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control
during treatment with metformin (3), sulfonylureas (4), or
the combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea (5). the
effects of exenatide on both hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) and
body weight in comparison with placebo (control groups)
in each of the studies are summarized in table 2. the addition of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes who had
inadequate glycemic control with use of orally administered agents resulted in a decrease in hba1c values of
approximately 1.0%. of particular importance, the improvement in glycemic control was associated with a substantial weight loss. longer term follow-up in some of the
studies showed that the weight reduction continued up to
at least 2 years, with a mean weight loss in excess of 5 kg.
the major side effect of exenatide is nausea, which
occurs during the first few weeks of therapy and decreases with advancing duration of treatment. in most patients,
the nausea is mild; however, in a few patients (approximately 2% to 3%), it may be severe. the nausea may be
minimized by beginning therapy with a low dose (5 mug or
less twice a day) and titrating the dose up to 10 mug. the
weight loss occurs equally in patients who have nausea
and in those who do not. low-titer antibodies have been

*patients received 5 mug of exenatide before breakfast and the evening meal for the first 4
weeks, after which they received 10 mug for 26 weeks. baseline mean hemoglobin a1c
(hba1c) and weight for the individual studies were 8.1% to 8.5% and 96 to 101 kg,
respectively. data are the mean difference between exenatide and placebo treatments.

detected in some patients receiving long-term treatment
with exenatide, but they neither interfere with its effectiveness nor cause any clinical side effects.
a recent 6-month study (6) comparing the effects of
adding exenatide versus adding insulin  xxxd2362xxx  to the
treatment regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes who had
inadequate glycemic control with metformin plus
sulfonylurea (mean hba1c of 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively) showed similar improvements in hba1c (decrease of
1.0% and 1.1%, respectively). the addition of exenatide,
however, was associated with a mean weight loss of 2.3
kg, whereas the addition of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  was associated with a mean weight gain of 1.8 kg (6).
 xxxd3510xxx 
 xxxd3510xxx  is a dpp-4 inhibitor that is currently
being studied in phase 3 clinical trials. in a core 12-week
double-blind placebo-controlled trial followed by a 40week extension study,  xxxd3510xxx  added to the treatment
of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin further decreased hba1c levels at 12 weeks by 0.7% (7).
 xxxd3510xxx  was given orally in a dosage of 50 mg once
daily. the effect of  xxxd3510xxx  was sustained for the 52
weeks of the study. dpp-4 inhibitors increase meal-mediated active glp-1 levels 2- to 3-fold by inhibiting the
degradation of glp-1. in contrast to glp-1 and exenatide,
dpp-4 inhibitors (including  xxxd3510xxx ) do not cause satiety and are not associated with weight loss. their effects
in stimulating meal-mediated insulin secretion seem to be
somewhat less than the effects of glp-1 and exenatide.
 xxxd2994xxx 
 xxxd2994xxx  is a synthetic modified amylin analogue
(8). amylin (a 37-amino acid peptide) is localized and
secreted concurrently with insulin in the pancreatic beta
cell. after secretion, amylin is taken up and binds to neurons in the area postrema. its effects, which include delay
in gastric emptying, suppression of glucagon secretion,
and stimulation of satiety, apparently are mediated by the
central nervous system (8,9). the immediate effect of
amylin secretion is modulation of the increase in postprandial glucose excursions. amylin deficiency accompanies insulin deficiency. in amylin-deficient states, there is
more rapid gastric emptying, which in association with
insulin deficiency causes an increase in postprandial glucose excursions. in contrast to incretin hormones, amylin
has no effect on secretion of insulin.
 xxxd2994xxx  has been approved by the fda for additive therapy in patients with insulin-treated type 1 (10-12)
and type 2 (13) diabetes. it notably reduces postprandial
glycemic excursions, lowers hba1c levels an additional
0.4% to 0.6%, increases satiety, and decreases food intake,
resulting in a modest weight loss of 1 to 2 kg during a period of 6 months. in patients with type 1 diabetes, who are
extremely sensitive to the effects of  xxxd2994xxx  (10-12),

therapy is usually initiated with 15 mug given subcutaneously in conjunction with each meal. the insulin dose is
decreased 50%. the  xxxd2994xxx  dose is slowly titrated up
to 30 mug and, if tolerated, to 60 mug with each meal. the
insulin dose can then be titrated to yield optimal glycemic
control without severe hypoglycemia. the limiting factor
in dosing is the side effect of nausea. patients with type 2
diabetes, in comparison with those who have type 1 diabetes, are much more resistant to the effects of  xxxd2994xxx 
(13). therefore, treatment can be started at higher doses
(30 mug) and titrated to higher doses (120 mug). nausea is
dose dependent, is usually mild to moderate, and decreases with long-term administration of  xxxd2994xxx . because
patients taking  xxxd2994xxx  experience an increase in satiety, they reduce the size of their ingested meals and lose
weight. this effect has been noted in overweight and
obese patients.
 xxxg479xxx  antagonist
the  xxxg479xxx  is present throughout the brain and
other tissues. studies with marijuana and  xxxd1943xxx  had indicated that stimulation of the cb1
receptor increased feeding behavior.  xxxg479xxx  antagonists were developed as potential agents to treat obesity.
phase 3 studies of rimonabant, a  xxxg479xxx  antagonist,
have been completed, in which its effects on obesity and
the metabolic syndrome were investigated (14,15).
currently, it is being reviewed by the fda as a new drug
application. in a 1-year study (rimonabant in obesitynorth america) in obese subjects, rimonabant (20
mg/day) decreased body weight and waist circumference,
decreased triglycerides, increased the level of high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol, and reduced the number
of patients who had the metabolic syndrome as determined
by the national cholesterol education program adult
treatment panel iii criteria (table 3) (16). as in all obesity studies, the dropout rate was high, so that a completer
analysis rather than an intention-to-treat analysis showed
somewhat better results with a weight loss of 8.7 kg in
comparison with 2.8 kg in the placebo-treated control subjects. glucose tolerance curves were somewhat improved,
as was insulin resistance as measured by homeostasis
model assessment of insulin resistance. clinically significant adverse events were primarily attributable to psychiatric symptoms.
in the second year of the rimonabant in obesitynorth america study, patients who continued to receive
rimonabant maintained but did not increase their weight
loss. patients who discontinued the rimonabant regained
some weight and ultimately had no different results than
the group that received placebo for 2 years (16).
it appears that rimonabant in a dosage of 20 mg/day
can decrease appetite and reduce weight. the effect is
modest, is maximal at 6 to 8 months, and necessitates continuous treatment to be sustained. some analyses suggest
that the improvements in insulin sensitivity and the com-

*the study enrolled 3,486 obese or overweight patients without diabetes. all patients were fed
a hypocaloric diet that was 600 kcal below requirements. patients were randomized to receive
placebo; rimonabant, 5 mg/day; or rimonabant, 20 mg/day. the approximate mean baseline
data were as follows: age 45 years, body mass index 38 kg/m2, weight 102 kg, and waist
circumference 107.5 cm. data are based on intention-to-treat analysis, last observation carried
forward.

ponents of the metabolic syndrome are only partially
attributable to the weight loss and that rimonabant has
direct effects that account for the rest of the benefit.
mixed ppar agonists
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists have a major effect in increasing the
transcription of genes that regulate adipose tissue differentiation, insulin action, and lipid storage. the clinical
consequences of treatment with  xxxg1807xxx  agonists are
increased insulin sensitivity and diminished abnormalities
of the metabolic syndrome.  xxxg1805xxx  agonists exert their
major effect on the liver to increase the transcription of
genes that promote fatty acid oxidation as well as increase
the clearance and decrease the synthesis of triglyceriderich very-low-density lipoprotein particles. the consequences of these actions are a reduction in plasma triglycerides, an increased level of plasma hdl cholesterol, and
an increased conversion of small, dense low-density
lipoprotein particles to large, buoyant, less atherogenic
particles. gemfibrozil and  xxxd2096xxx  are examples of
 xxxg1805xxx  agonists.
the ppar binding sites have been identified by x-ray
crystallography, and it is possible to synthesize molecules
that can activate multiple ppar sites (17). combining
 xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  activities into a single compound has
the potential to provide a more effective agent for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
previous attempts to create such a mixed agonist yielded
compounds with increased activity; however, their side
effect profiles were serious enough to preclude their clinical development. two mixed  xxxg1805xxx - xxxg1807xxx  agonists are
currently in clinical development. phase 3 studies of
muraglitazar have been completed (18,19), and the fda is

currently reviewing a new drug application for this agent.
tesaglitazar is currently being studied in phase 3 clinical
trials.
phase 3 data from muraglitazar investigations were
presented at the 2005 annual meetings of the american
association of clinical endocrinologists and the
american diabetes association (19). muraglitazar was
initially evaluated in dosages ranging from 1.5 to 20
mg/day. fluid retention and weight gain were considerable
with dosages of 10 and 20 mg/day, and phase 3 studies
were done with use of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/day. the effects of
muraglitazar were compared with placebo in patients with
type 2 diabetes and a baseline mean hba1c of 7.89% to
8.02%. after 24 weeks, the patients treated with muraglitazar showed a significant decrease in hba1c and triglycerides and a significant increase in hdl cholesterol level
(table 4). the side effects of weight gain and edema, however, were also increased (table 4). in another phase 3
study, muraglitazar (5 mg/day) or pioglitazone (30
mg/day) was added to the treatment of 1,159 patients who
had inadequate glycemic control with metformin therapy.
after 12 weeks, muraglitazar had a greater effect in
decreasing the levels of triglycerides, free  xxxd2154xxx , and
 xxxg175xxx  and a greater effect in increasing the
level of hdl cholesterol than did pioglitazone. at the end
of the study (24 weeks), muraglitazar lowered the hba1c
and fasting plasma glucose values more than did pioglitazone (table 5).
a recent report in the journal of the american
medical association, which analyzed the safety data presented at the fda advisory committee meeting, stated that
âcompared with placebo or pioglitazone, muraglitazar
was associated with an excess incidence of the composite
end point of death, major adverse cardiovascular events

approval of muraglitazar be withheld unless a long-term
cardiovascular safety study shows that the drug is safe
(20).
newer insulin analogues and new
insulin delivery systems
insulin therapy is critical for achieving target
glycemic control in all patients with type 1 diabetes and
many patients with type 2 diabetes. the availability of true
basal and bolus insulins has been possible only with the
development of insulin analogues.  xxxd2363xxx  is a

recently approved bolus insulin (21). clinical trials show
it to be as effective as insulin lispro or insulin aspart.
pharmacokinetic data suggest that it may have advantages
in obese patients, but clinical trials must be undertaken to
determine whether that projection proves to be accurate.
 xxxd2361xxx  is a new basal insulin recently approved by
the fda. clinical trials have demonstrated that it has very
favorable characteristics as a basal insulin (22).
the first inhaled insulin preparation (exubera) has
completed phase 3 clinical trials and is currently being
reviewed as a new drug application by the fda. clinical
trials show it to be as effective as, but no better than, bolus
insulin to control postprandial glucose excursions (23).

the issue of long-term pulmonary safety in the diabetic
population at large is still a major concern.
conclusion
patients with diabetes are finally receiving the
rewards of the huge investment that has been made in diabetes and related research during the past 2 decades. the
plethora of new drugs and technologic advances being
made available will help achieve the goals of treating
patients with diabetes to all the appropriate metabolic targets. many other agents that act on fundamental abnormalities such as energy imbalance, inflammation, and vascular biologic disorders are early in development but are
likely to become available during the next 5 to 10 years.
as clinicians, our goals should be to learn to use
effectively all the new tools that have been developed and
to integrate them with the strategies that have been available to achieve the best clinical outcomes possible for our
patients with diabetes.
