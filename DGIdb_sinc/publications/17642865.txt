randomised controlled trial of topical  xxxd394xxx  in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.   xxxd394xxx  is a new antifungal agent similar to allyl amine antifungals. a randomized controlled trial was conducted in 75 patients to compare its efficacy with  xxxd1732xxx  in tinea cruris and corporis that was diagnosed on clinical features and demonstration of hyphae in a potassium hydroxide (koh) preparation. twenty patients treated with  xxxd394xxx  once daily for 2 weeks and 20 treated with  xxxd1732xxx  twice daily for 4 weeks were analysed. at the end of treatment, 2 weeks and 4 weeks later, the koh preparation was negative in 90.9%, 95.5% and 90.9% of patients respectively in the  xxxd394xxx  group and 100%, 96.4% and 92.85% respectively in the  xxxd1732xxx  group. there was a reduction of 81.5% in the sign and symptom score at 4 weeks following treatment in the  xxxd394xxx  group and 85.93% in the  xxxd1732xxx  group. there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. adverse effects were mild in both groups and did not require discontinuation of therapy except one patient treated with  xxxd1732xxx  who developed dermatitis at the site of application.  xxxd394xxx  appears to be as effective as  xxxd1732xxx  in the treatment of tinea cruris and corporis while requiring a single daily application for a shorter of 2 weeks.
