characterization of esterases
involved in the hydrolysis of
 xxxd1912xxx  hydrochloride

 

abstract

we characterized the interaction of the prodrug  xxxd1912xxx 
hydrochloride (dpe) with esterase activity in the rabbit cor-
nea. the esterases which were identified included: (1) cholin-
esterase, (2) acetylcholinesterase, (3) a mixture containing car-
boxylesterase, acetylesterase and arylesterase, and (4) a non-
specific esterase. dpe suppressed all of their activities as well
as that of the mixture containing carboxylesterase, acetyl-
esterase and arylesterase, and a nonspecific esterase. however,
its effect on cholinesterase was larger than on any of the other
activities, suggesting that dpe is a better substrate for choli-
nesterase than for any of the other esterases. these measure-
ments along with those of substrate-dependent inhibition of
'4c_dpe hydrolysis indicated that the dpe-esterase interac-
tion was competitive based on changes in the apparent k,
values which were extracted from lineweaver-burk plots of
esterase activity. the substrate for cholinesterase competed
with dpe most strongly among substrates. these results seem
to suggest that dpe is hydrolyzed by various corneal esterases,
mainly cholinesterase.

ation for two reasons: (1) esterase activity has
not been extensively classified in the cornea;
and (2) the kinetics of a dpe-esterase interac-
tion have not been described.

we report here on the characterization of
esterase activity in the rabbit cornea. the par-
ticular activities considered were: (1) cholin-
esterase [ xxxg248xxx ], (2) acetylcholinesterase
[ xxxg38xxx ], (3) a mixture containing  xxxd2809xxx -
ylesterase [ xxxg430xxx ], acetylesterase [ec
3.1.1.6] and arylesterase [ec 3.1.1.2], and (4)
a nonspecific esterase. this characterization
included measurements of the effects of dpe
on their activities as well as substrate-me-
diated changes in '4c-dpe release.

materials and methods

preparation of corneal enzyme sample

male white rabbits, weighing 2-3 kg, were main-
tained and used in conformance with the arvo reso-
lution on the use of animals in research. the rabbits
were killed by an intravenous overdose of pentobarbi-
tal. the eyes were enucleated and the corneas imme-
diately removed. the corneas were rinsed with a physi-
ological saline buffer and then homogenized in 5 ml of
an ice-cold isotonic  xxxd2988xxx  per
gram of cornea in a potter- elvehjem glass homogeniz-
er. the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g and
the supernatant used to assay for esterase activity.

 

  

measurement of esterase activity

cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. cholines-
terase and acetylcholinesterase were determined by
using butyrylthiocholine (busch) and acetylthiochol-
ine (asch) as specific substrates, respectively [11, 12].

the assay mixture contained either busch or asch
and the corneal enzyme sample, 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitro-
 xxxd306xxx ) (0.21 mm) and phosphate buffer (4 mm,
ph 7.2) and was incubated at 37°c for 10 min. the
reaction was stopped by the addition of quinidine sul-
fate (0.55 mm), and the production of 5-thio-2-benzoic
acid was measured in an absorption spectrophotome-
ter (shimadzu, uv-190) at 412 nm.

carboxylesterase, acetylesterase and arylesterase.
activities of carboxylesterase, acetylesterase and aryl-
esterase were determined as total activity. the activity
was determined by using p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-
npa) as a substrate [13-15]. the reaction mixture
contained p-npa, the corneal enzyme sample and
sodium phosphate buffer (2 mm, ph 7.2). it was incu-
bated at 37°c. after mixing, formation of p-nitrophe-
nol was monitored in an absorption spectrophotome-
ter at 405 nm. the activity was calculated from mea-
suring the rates of the initial change in absorption.

nonspecific esterase. nonspecific esterase was de-
termined according to ecobichon and kalow [16] by
using a-naphthyl acetate (a-na) as a substrate. the
reaction mixture of a-na and corneal enzyme sample
was incubated at 37°c. after mixing, formation of a-
naphthol was monitored at 470 nm in a spectrofluor-
ometer (shimadzu, rf-500lc) following excitation at

inhibition of rabbit corneal esterase by dpe

to assess esterase-mediated hydrolysis of dpe, the
effects of dpe were determined on the kinetic parame-
ter, apparent km and via, using lineweaver-burk
plots, in the condition as shown in table 1.

the esterase activities were measured with dpe
over the range between 0.001 and 10 mm, with the
substrate concentration at 0.8 mm. the percent inhibi-
tion of esterase activity by various concentrations of
dpe was calculated.

inhibition of dpe hydrolysis by substrate

'4c-labeled dpe (7-!4c-dpe, specific activity 1
mci/mmol; allergan pharmaceutical co., ltd., usa)
was used. the chemical structure of 7-'4c-dpe is
shown in figure |. the reaction mixture contained 7-
'4c-dpe (0.19 wci/ml), each substrate solution and
corneal enzyme sample, and it was incubated at 37°c
for 20 min. the reaction was stopped by the addition
of quinidine sulfate (0.43 mm). dpe and epi were
added to the reaction mixture as standards for thin-
layer chromatography. this mixture was spotted on
silicagel-plates (merck, no. 5735). chcl3, ch;0h
and  xxxd2154xxx  (30:20:1 vol/vol) were used as the devel-
oper. after developing, these plates were sprayed with

esterases with and without dpe. table 2

of the presence or absence of dpe. the inhi-

because the apparent k,, values significantly
increased with dpe, whereas the vinax values
were not changed, as shown in table 2.

ner. cholinesterase was more inhibited by
dpe than any of the other esterases. the
order of inhibition for these other esterases
was nonspecific esterase > mixture of  xxxd2809xxx -

acetylcholinesterase.

figure 4 shows the percent inhibition of
dpe hydrolysis by the specific substrates for
these esterases. hydrolysis of dpe was inhib-
ited by all of these substrates in a dose- xxxd2870xxx -

inhibitor of hydrolysis of dpe than any of the
other substrates. the rank order of these other
substrates was p-npa > a-na > asch.

discussion

acetylcholinesterase, cholinesterase and
arylesterase activities in the rabbit cornea
have been previously described [4-10]. these
activities are responsible for hydrolysis of the
prodrug dpe to form epi. however, the
types of esterases involved may not be fully

described, and the mechanism of dpe inter-
action with these esterases has not been pre-
viously described. accordingly, a more de-
tailed examination of esterase activity in the
rabbit cornea was warranted and is also rele-
vant to determining which esterases can hy-
drolyze dpe. in the present study, we ad-
dressed these questions by classifying the
types of esterase in the cornea and quanti-
tated changes in esterase activity stemming
from the presence of !*c-dpe. furthermore,
the nature of dpe interaction with an esterase
was determined based on an evaluation of the
kinetic parameters. the results of this endea-
vor also permitted the evaluation of the thera-
peutic efficacy of applying dpe in combina-
tion with a cholinesterase inhibitor.

our results showing the presence of cholin-
esterase, acetylcholinesterase and carboxyl-
esterase are in agreement with previous de-
scriptions of their activities in the rabbit cor-
nea [4-10]. we also found that their specific
substrate-dependent activities were competi-
tively inhibited by dpe because '4c release
from dpe was suppressed in the presence of
one of these substrates. furthermore, dpe
supplementation decreased the apparent km

values characteristic of these reactions. that
the activities of all of these esterases were
competitively inhibited by dpe suggests that
dpe can be hydrolyzed by more than one
esterase. on the other hand, the extent of inhi-
bition by dpe of a nonspecific esterase was
less than that measured for cholinesterase but
greater than that for acetylcholinesterase.
this lack of an apparent requirement for a
specific esterase for dpe hydrolysis is also in
agreement with the rate of '4c release mea-
sured in the presence of a mixture of esterases;
namely it was intermediate to the values ob-
tained with specific esterases. therefore, our
results show that dpe exhibits competitive
inhibition with all of the esterases in the rab-
bit cornea.

in order to clarify if any of these esterases
was more effective in hydrolyzing dpe, the
ratios of apparent k,, values were calculated
in both the absence and presence of dpe.
furthermore, the concentrations of dpe
needed to inhibit esterase activity by 50%,
1cso, and conversely the substrate concentra-
tion needed to decrease '4c release from dpe
were evaluated. the results shown in table 3
indicate that busch had the highest ratio of
apparent k,, values, followed by p-npa and
asch. in addition, dpe hydrolysis was best
inhibited by busch but less so by p-npa and
asch. therefore, dpe competitively inhib-
ited cholinesterase more than the mixture of
carboxylesterase, acetylesterase and arylester-
ase, and acetylcholinesterase. this order of
effectiveness suggests that of cholinesterase is
the main esterase for dpe hydrolysis. it was
reported that cholinesterase is the main ester-
ase in ocular tissues, whereas carboxylesterase
is the major esterase in the liver and other
organs [17, 18]. therefore, dpe is hydrolyzed
by all esterases but more so by cholinesterase.

two kinds of esterase inhibitors are used
in the treatment of glaucoma: phosphorylat-
ing drugs, e.g.  xxxd1962xxx  iodine, and car-

 

50 nakamura/shirasawa/hikida

 xxxd1912xxx  hydrolysis esterase
bamoylating drugs, e.g. physostigmine sulfate.
dpe isalso used in glaucoma therapy. if choli-
nesterase inhibitors inhibit arylesterase and
alkylesterase, both of which hydrolyze dpe, a
combination therapy including cholinesterase
inhibitors and dpe would not be effective.
this possibility was investigated in pigmented
rabbits and humans [19-22]. in an earlier
work, the prior administration of echothio-
phate inhibited the hypotensive effect of dpe.
however, it was subsequently realized that
cholinesterase inhibitors did not inhibit the
enzymatic conversion of dpe to epi. from

our present study, though, dpe is mainly
hydrolyzed by cholinesterase. however, dpe
can also be hydrolyzed by other esterases,
e.g. acetylcholinesterase and carboxylester-
ase, acetylesterase and arylesterase. therefore,
it seems that the hydrolysis of dpe would not
be inhibited when it is used in combination
therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors.
