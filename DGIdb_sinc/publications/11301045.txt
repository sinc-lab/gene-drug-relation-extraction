inhibition of liver methionine adenosyltransferase gene expression by 3-methylcolanthrene: protective effect of  xxxd3156xxx .  methionine adenosyltransferase (mat) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ), the most important biological methyl donor. liver mat i/iii is the product of the  xxxg1378xxx  gene. hepatic mat i/iii activity and  xxxg1378xxx  expression are compromised under pathological conditions such as alcoholic liver disease and hepatic cirrhosis, and this gene is silenced upon neoplastic transformation of the liver. in the present work, we evaluated whether  xxxg1378xxx  expression could be targeted by the polycyclic arylhydrocarbon (pah) 3-methylcholanthrene (3-mc) in rat liver and cultured hepatocytes.  xxxg1378xxx  mrna levels were reduced by 50% following in vivo administration of 3-mc to adult male rats (100 mg/kg, p.o., 4 days' treatment). this effect was reproduced in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in cultured rat hepatocytes, and was accompanied by the induction of  xxxg575xxx  gene expression. this action of 3-mc was mimicked by other pahs such as benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[e]pyrene, but not by the model arylhydrocarbon receptor (ahr) activator 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. 3-mc inhibited transcription driven by a  xxxg1378xxx  promoter-reporter construct transfected into rat hepatocytes, but  xxxg1378xxx  mrna stability was not affected. we recently showed that liver  xxxg1378xxx  expression is induced by  xxxd3156xxx  in cultured hepatocytes. here, we observed that exogenously added  xxxd3156xxx  prevented the negative effects of 3-mc on  xxxg1378xxx  expression. taken together, our data demonstrate that liver  xxxg1378xxx  gene expression is targeted by pahs, independently of ahr activation. the effect of  xxxd3156xxx  may be part of the protective action of this molecule in liver damage.
