we investigated the effects of intravenous administration of  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride, a dual vasopressin
v1a and  xxxg231xxx  antagonist, on blood electrolytes and plasma osmolality in rats with an experimental syndrome of inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3495xxx  (siadh). the experimental siadh rat model was developed by means of continuous administration of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pump, and hyponatremia was induced by additional water loading. this model possesses similar
characteristics to those observed in patients with siadh, specifically decreases in blood sodium concentration
and plasma osmolality. in this experimental model, intravenous administration of  xxxd1747xxx  (0.1, 1 mg/kg) significantly increased blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality. on the other hand, intravenous administration of furosemide (10 mg/kg) did not increase either blood sodium concentration or plasma osmolality in the
siadh rats. moreover, furosemide significantly lowered blood potassium concentration. these results show that
 xxxd1747xxx  improves hyponatremia in rats with siadh, supporting the therapeutic potential of  xxxd1747xxx  in
treatment of patients with hyponatremia associated with siadh.

the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
hormone (siadh) is a clinical state in which the secretion of
 xxxd3495xxx  (adh), also called  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), is not suppressed appropriately when plasma
osmolality falls below the osmotic threshold and may lead to
impaired renal water excretion, increased total body water,
and hyponatremia.1) siadh is associated with a number of
underlying clinical conditions, such as malignancy, lung disease, and central nervous system and hormonal disorders.2)
avp is a peptide hormone that is released from the posterior pituitary gland in response to an increase in plasma osmolality and volume depletion. three classes of specific receptor have been identified in the periphery. the vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx , which has been identified in vascular smooth
muscle cells, hepatocytes and platelets, and the vasopressin
 xxxg230xxx , which is found predominantly in the anterior
pituitary, are coupled to the phosphoinositide pathway and
elevation of intracellular ca2. the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx ,
which is located in the kidney and the vascular endothelium,
is coupled to the adenylate cyclase pathway, causing an increase in c-amp.3)
avp elicits a potent water reabsorption effect in the collecting ducts of the kidney via the vasopressin v2 receptors,
as well as systemic vasoconstriction via the vasopressin v1a
receptors.4—6) the facilitation of renal water reabsorption via
the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  results in an increase in total
body water, which in turn causes a decrease in blood sodium
concentration and plasma osmolality. the increased total
body water causes inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the
proximal tubule via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as elevation of glomerular filtration
rate and facilitation of the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) from the atrium.7) these stimuli produce sus∗ to whom correspondence should be addressed.

tained urinary sodium excretion, and result in hyponatremia,
the most common electrolyte disorder associated with
siadh.
clinical manifestations of hyponatremia range from mild
symptoms, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, to severe
symptoms, such as disorientation, disturbed consciousness
and seizures.8) although the treatment of hyponatremia
should be directed at the primary underlying etiology of disorder, this is not always entirely possible. thus, the general
approach to the management of hyponatremia is normalization of blood sodium concentration by the prevention of
water retention in the body.9)
one treatment used for acute severe hyponatremia is the
intravenous administration of furosemide concomitantly with
hypertonic saline. diuretics are used in the treatment of
chronic hyponatremia, however, resistance to loop diuretics
such as furosemide is a common problem in hyponatremia
patients.10) further, loop diuretics may worsen hyponatremia
and induce hypokalemia, a potentially serious electrolyte disorder that can result in the prolongation of qt interval and
the subsequent risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
the recent development of non-peptide vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonists11,12) has allowed further understanding of
the pathophysiological role of avp in hyponatremia.13) study
results indicate that vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonism may
be an effective and rational treatment for hyponatremia associated with siadh.14,15)
 xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride is a novel non-peptide vasopressin receptor antagonist with a high affinity for rat and
human vasopressin v1a and v2 receptors and rather weak
affinity for oxytocin receptors.16,17)  xxxd1747xxx  have been
shown to exert a dose-dependent aquaretic effect in several
animal models.18,19) however, the question of whether coni-

vaptan can alleviate the hyponatremia caused by experimental siadh has not been determined.
in this study, we investigated the effects of intravenous
 xxxd1747xxx  and furosemide, a loop diuretic, on blood electrolyte concentration and plasma osmolality in an experimental siadh rat model.
materials and methods
materials  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride was synthesized by
astellas pharm inc. (tokyo, japan).  xxxd1747xxx  weighed to
the necessary amount, 10% w/v ethanol (special grade;
kanto chemical co., inc.; tokyo, japan) was added and
stirred, and 30% w/v  xxxd3034xxx  (kanto chemical co.,
inc.) was added to this mixture. after stirring and dissolving
well, the ph of the solution was adjusted to approximately
3.3 with an appropriate volume of lactic acid (wako pure
chemical industries, ltd.; osaka, japan), and the resulting
solution was used as the 1 mg/kg  xxxd1747xxx  dosing solution.
this solution was diluted with distilled water for injection to
adjust the volume. the 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg  xxxd1747xxx  dosing
solutions were prepared by diluting the 1 mg/kg dosing solution with vehicle. furosemide was commercially supplied in
ampoules (hoechst japan; tokyo, japan, 20 mg/2 ml). each
drug was administered intravenously at 1 ml/kg. sham and
control groups received the same volume of vehicle, composed of 10% ethanol, 30%  xxxd3034xxx , and 60% distilled water for injection. avp was commercially purchased
(peptide institute inc.; osaka, japan).
preparation of rat siadh model male wistar rats
weighing 244 to 313 g were used. the siadh model was
prepared by continuous avp infusion via an implanted osmotic mini pump along with oral water loading according to
the method reported by kinter.20) briefly, rats anesthetized
with ether underwent dorsal subcutaneous implantation of an
osmotic mini pump (alzet model 2001; durect corp.; ca,
u.s.a.) filled with avp solution. the avp solution was prepared by dissolving avp in distilled water to deliver a dose
of 3 m g/d. sham-operated rats underwent dorsal subcutaneous implantation of an osmotic mini pump filled with distilled water. the experimental protocol is shown in fig. 1.
the day of surgical implantation was defined as day 1. water
loading (30 ml/kg p.o.) was conducted three times (around
9:00, 13:00, 17:00) on day 2, and once on day 3 (around
9:00) in both the siadh and sham-operated rats.
study protocols this study consisted of two experiments. in experiment 1, the siadh rats were divided into 4
groups of 5—6 animals each following water loading on day
3 and administered intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  (0.01, 0.1 or
1 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg) via the left femoral vein under
light ether anesthesia (fig. 1).
in experiment 2, groups of 4—5 siadh rats were given
intravenous furosemide (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg) just
after water loading on day 3, as in experiment 1. sham-operated rats were given vehicle in both experiments. at 4 h
after dosing, blood samples were collected under ether anesthesia to determine sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations in blood by the electrode method with an electrolyte
analyzer (chiron 348; chiron diagnostics corp.; ma,
u.s.a.). plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation of
blood at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °c. plasma osmolality was

measured by the freezing point depression method using an
osmometer (model 3c2, advanced instruments, inc.; ma,
u.s.a.).
statistical analysis data were analyzed using the sas
software (sas institute inc.; nc, u.s.a.). all data are expressed as the means.e.m. analysis between the sham-operated group and the vehicle-treated group (referred to as the
control group) in both experiments, and between the control
and furosemide-treated groups in experiment 2, was performed by the unpaired student’s t-test. analysis between the
control and  xxxd1747xxx -treated (0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg) groups
was performed with dunnett’s multiple range test in experiment 1. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the effect of intravenous
 xxxd1747xxx  in siadh rats, and demonstrated that  xxxd1747xxx 
increased blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality
in this animal model. in contrast, furosemide did not significantly increase blood sodium concentration or plasma osmolality, but did induce hypokalemia in siadh rats. these
findings indicate that  xxxd1747xxx  has therapeutic potential for
the effective treatment of hyponatremia associated with
siadh.
siadh is a condition in which the plasma avp level is
not appropriately suppressed despite of hypoosmolality. the
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  plays a prominent role in the regulation of water homeostasis. therefore, the effect of sustained
high level of avp via the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  are closely
implicated in water retaining diseases, including hyponatremia, renal disease, cirrhosis and edema.21) we produced
siadh rats by means of continuous administration of avp
via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pump. the
siadh rat model, which exhibits a dilutional reduction in
blood sodium concentration due to water retention caused by
continuous administration of avp, was originally developed
by kinter.20) in experiments 1 and 2, blood sodium concentration in siadh rats of the control group significantly fell
to 123 and 120 meq/l, respectively, compared to the shamoperated groups (142, 144 meq/l, respectively). given that
hyponatremia is clinically defined as a serum sodium level
less than 136 meq/l,22) these findings indicate that continuous
infusion of avp and additional forced water loadings for 3 d
promptly produced hyponatremia in the siadh rats.
siadh is associated with abnormal water retention mediated by inappropriate avp release despite hypotonicity.23)
since excess avp continuously exerts a potent water retention effect via vasopressin v2 receptors in the distal renal
tubule, dilutional hyponatremia can be induced in siadh
rats. in clinical practice, hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that is frequently undertreated. although the
pathophysiological process of hyponatremia is complex,
siadh is a common etiologic factor.
in the present study, intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  significantly
increased blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality
in the siadh rats 4 h after dosing. no marked change in
blood potassium concentration was seen in the  xxxd1747xxx 
treated groups.  xxxd1747xxx  has been shown to inhibit the
binding of radiolabeled avp to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
in a competitive manner.16,17) additionally intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  has been reported to increase urine volume in a dose-

vol. 30, no. 1

dependent manner without an increase in urine electrolytes in
rats and dogs.16,19,24) in our study, we confirmed a dose-dependent aquaretic effect of intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  (0.01, 0.1,
1 mg/kg) (data not shown) in an siadh rat model. we therefore consider that the increase in water excretion caused by
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  blockade is closely related to the increase in blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality
in these siadh rats. this finding is supported by clinical evidence in patients with siadh. patients treated with intravenous opc-31260, a vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonist,
demonstrated an increase in urine volume and decreased
urine osmolality during the initial 4 h after dosing, resulting
in a significant increase in serum sodium level.15)
song et al. reported a slight increase in mean blood
pressure in desmopressin (1-deamino-[8- xxxd862xxx ]-vasopressin)-infused rats which also showed water retention and
hyponatremia.25) desmopressin is an avp analogue which
shows a strong antidiuretic effect but less potent vasoconstrictive effect because of its agonistic effect on the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  and antagonistic effect on the vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx .26) volume expansion may therefore contribute
to the increase in mean blood pressure in desmopressin-infused rats. in the present study, blood pressure was not determined in the siadh rats, although it was presumed that
blood pressure rose on continuous infusion of avp which exerts vasoconstrictive effect via the vasopressin  xxxg229xxx 
in addition to water retention via the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx .
clinical reports of elevation in blood pressure in association
with siadh also exist.27,28)  xxxd1747xxx  is a combined
v1a/ xxxg231xxx  antagonist16,17) and the use of the dual antagonist has the theoretical advantage of reducing blood pressure elevated by excessive avp.
intravenous administration of  xxxd1747xxx  was shown to
improve hyponatremia in a dose-dependent fashion in
siadh rats. the fundamental principle of treatment for hyponatremia is normalization of the decreased blood sodium
concentration. however, the optimal rate of blood sodium
correction in patients with chronic hyponatremia remain controversial owing to the risk of developing brain damage, such
as osmotic demyelinolysis, if rapid correction of blood
sodium concentration occurs in patients who have already
undergone a cerebral adaptation.29) as a general, the decreased blood sodium concentration in patients with chronic
or severe hyponatremia must be normalized by limiting the
correction rate.30) an intravenous formulation of  xxxd1747xxx 
allows the flexible adjustment of doses and may be useful to
the management of patients with chronic hyponatremia, in
whom blood sodium levels should be corrected with caution.
even if so, it is recommended that the blood sodium levels
and neurologic status in the patients treated with intravenous
 xxxd1747xxx  should be closely monitored to avoid overcorrection.
furosemide is commonly prescribed when immediate
treatment is required in patients with acute developed hyponatremia, who are at high risk of cerebral oedema, cerebral
herniation.31) in the present study, intravenous furosemide at
a dose of 10 mg/kg had no effect on either blood sodium concentration or plasma osmolality in the siadh model. the
dosage of furosemide was confirmed to increase urine volume in the siadh rats to a closely similar degree to intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  at 0.1 mg/kg, and to increase urinary

sodium excretion (data not shown). therefore, this diuretic
might not directly address a hyponatremia induced by the effect of excess avp. the excessive natriuretic effect of these
diuretics may further decrease plasma sodium concentration,
resulting in an imbalance in plasma electrolytes. in addition,
it is reported that treatment by long-term administration of
loop diuretics enhances water retention, resulting from water
reabsorption in the kidney collecting duct stimulated by enhanced physiological avp secretion.32) further, furosemide
in the present siadh rats was shown to simultaneously decrease blood potassium concentration. given that furosemide
facilitates sodium and potassium excretion in the renal
tubule,33) the potential may exist for hypokalemia as well as
hyponatremia. it has been demonstrated that hypokalemia increases susceptibility of the heart to ventricular arrhythmia in
experimental studies.34,35) particularly in the diseased heart,
hypokalemia might be a risk factor for secondary prolongation of qt interval and consequent life-threatening cardiac
arrhythmia.36—38) considered together, these findings may
offer a warning that the use of furosemide in patients with
hyponatremia resulting from persistently high avp levels
theoretically seems inappropriate.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that  xxxd1747xxx  improves hyponatremia in the rat siadh model. in
contrast, furosemide was not only unable to correct hyponatremia in these rats, but additionally induced hypokalemia.
these results indicate that the vasopressin antagonist  xxxd1747xxx  may be a specific and appropriate treatment option for
patients with hyponatremia secondary to siadh.
