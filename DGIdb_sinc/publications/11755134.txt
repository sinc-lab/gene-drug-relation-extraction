abstract
agonist and antagonist properties of antipsychotics at human (h) recombinant 5-hydroxytryptamine1a (h5-ht1a) receptor have been
examined previously in transfected chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells using 50-o-(3-[35s]thio)-triphosphate ([35s] gtpgs) binding. na + dependent [35s] gtp g s binding to membranes from human epithelioid carcinoma (hela) cells, expressing 500 fmol/mg protein of h5-ht1a
receptor (ha7 cells), appears suitable to characterize not only agonist and antagonist properties of  xxxg1108xxx  ligands, but also inverse
agonist properties. we therefore examined agonist, antagonist, and  xxxd1422xxx  activity of antipsychotics at h5-ht1a receptor in ha7
cells. some antipsychotics had agonist activity and stimulated [35s] gtp g s binding with the following order of efficacy:
nemonapride > ziprasidone > clozapine > ocaperidone. tiospirone and trans-5-chloro-2-methyl-2,3,3a,12b-tetrahydro-1h-dibenz[2,3:6,7,5]oxepino-[4,5c]pyrrole (org 5222), were more potent h5-ht1a receptor antagonists than raclopride, olanzapine, and risperidone.
haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine,  xxxd2956xxx , and  xxxd3195xxx  showed na + -dependent  xxxd1422xxx  activity at h5-ht1a receptor that
could be antagonized by (s)-n-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide [(s)-way 100135]. these results are
further evidence that interactions with h5-ht1a receptors could play a role in the pharmacological profile of certain antipsychotics, and that
na + affects the ability to detect  xxxd1422xxx  activity at h5-ht1a receptors, likely by influencing receptor precoupling. also, the manner in
which compounds interact with 5-ht1a receptors appears to be related to their kb/ki ratio. d 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
growing evidence indicates 5-hydroxytryptamine1a ( xxxg1108xxx ) receptors to be a potential target for novel antipsychotic drugs (for a review, see bantick et al., 2001). for
example,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, such as 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat), block haloperidol- and raclopride-induced catalepsy in rats (e.g. mcmillen
et al., 1988; wadenberg and ahlenius, 1991; andersen and
kilpatrick, 1996), and enhance antipsychotic-like effects of
haloperidol and raclopride (wadenberg and ahlenius, 1991;
prinssen et al., 1996).  xxxg1108xxx  agonists also increase dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex of rodents
(rollema et al., 1997), an effect that has been predicted to
improve negative symptoms (sharma and shapiro, 1996).
moreover, (putative) atypical antipsychotics such as cloza-

pine, ziprasidone, and tiospirone exert partial agonist activity at h5-ht1a receptors, while conventional antipsychotics
such as haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , raclopride and chlorpromazine, and some atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone
and  xxxd3195xxx , have been characterized as ‘‘silent’’ antagonists at h5-ht1a receptors expressed in chinese hamster
ovary cells (cho) (newman-tancredi et al., 1998).
drug effects at recombinant human receptors expressed in
heterologous systems can be affected by spontaneous receptor precoupling that is influenced by receptor density, g
protein pools, and cation concentrations (see de ligt et al.,
2000 for a review). the na + dependency of h5-ht1a receptor precoupling in human epithelioid carcinoma hela cells
expressing 500 fmol/mg protein of human recombinant  xxxg1108xxx  receptor (ha7 cells) allowed us to show that n-[2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-(2-pyridinyl)
cyclohexanecarboxamide (way 100635), characterized initially as ‘‘silent’’ 5-ht1a antagonist (newman-tancredi et
al., 1997), has marked  xxxd1422xxx  properties at h5-ht1a
receptors (cosi and koek, 2000). this latter finding agrees
with previous reports that described a tendency of way

100635 to decrease basal 50-o-(3-[35s]thio)-triphosphate
([35s] gtpgs) binding in h5-ht1a cho cells (newmantancredi et al., 1996), in h5-ht1a c6 glioma cells (pauwels
et al., 1997), and in cos-7 cells transiently expressing
recombinant h5-ht1a receptor fusion proteins (dupuis et
al., 1999). thus, na+ -dependent [35s] gtp g s binding to
membranes from ha7 cells appears to be especially suitable
to characterize  xxxd1422xxx  properties of  xxxg1108xxx 
ligands. here, we therefore examined, in this system, the
possible  xxxd1422xxx  properties of antipsychotics at the
h5-ht1a receptor.

sion (sigmoidal model with unit slope; graphpad prism).
linear regression analyses were performed using graphpad
prism.
pkb values were calculated from the ec50 values of the
concentration – response curves of 5-carboxamidotryptamine
maleate (5-ct) in the absence (ec50 5-ct) and in the presence of a single concentration of the antagonist (ec50 5ct + antagonist) as follows: pkb = log(dr  1)  log ([anta
gonist]); dr=(ec50 5-ct + antagonist)/(ec50 5-ct). pkb
values for nemonapride and ziprasidone were calculated
using the ec50 values of the concentration –response curves
of 5-ct with the minimum constrained to the minimum
value of the 5-ct curve obtained in presence of the antagonist (see fig. 1).

2.1. cell culture

2.3. 5-ht1a radioligand binding assay

ha7 cells (fargin et al., 1989) were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem) (gibco) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, gentamicin (100 mg/ml), and
 xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ) (400 mg/ml), in 5% co2 at 37 c in a watersaturated atmosphere. the cells were plated in 150-cm2 petri
dishes until they reached a 90 – 100% confluence, after which
they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
stored at  80 c until used for [35s] gtpgs binding or  xxxg1108xxx  radioligand binding assays.

the membranes were prepared from frozen ha7 cells as
described below. cells were harvested in ice-cold tris (2amino-2-hydroxymethylpropane-1,3-diol) – hcl ph 7.4,
homogenized and centrifuged at 40 000  g, 4 c for 10

2.2. [35s] gtpgs binding
the membranes were prepared from the frozen cells, on
the day of the experiment, according to stanton and beer
(1997) with some modifications. cells were harvested in icecold 20 mm hepes [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulphonic acid] buffer containing 10 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) (ph 7.4, room temperature), and
were homogenized and centrifuged at 40 000  g, 4 c for 15
min. the pellet was suspended in ice-cold 20 mm hepes
containing 0.1 mm edta (ph 7.4, room temperature) and
centrifuged again at 40 000  g, 4 c for 15 min. the final
pellet was suspended in 20 mm hepes containing 10 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm  xxxd2850xxx , 30 mm gdp, and 100 mm nacl
(called the standard nacl condition) or no nacl added
(called the low nacl condition). the membranes, 100 –50
mg/tube, were incubated in the presence of the test compounds, for 1 h, at 30 c. in the antagonism studies, different
compounds were added at the same time. after 15 min at 0
c, [35s] gtpgs (specific activity  1000 ci/mmol) was
added to a final concentration of 0.1 nm. the membranes
were then incubated for an additional 30 min, at 30 c. the
reaction was terminated by filtration through whatman
filters using a brandel harvester, and radioactivity was
counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
each concentration– response experiment was performed
in triplicate and replicated three to six times. for each
replication, pec50 and emax values were estimated from
concentration –response data by means of non-linear regres-

min. the pellet was suspended in the same buffer and
centrifuged again. after the second centrifugation, the pellet
was suspended in an assay buffer consisting of  xxxd2850xxx  (10
mm) and cacl2 (4 mm) in tris – hcl (50 mm, ph 7.4).
membrane protein, 0.031 – 0.084 mg/tube, was incubated
with [3h] 8-oh-dpat (1 nm final concentration) and the
test compounds at seven concentrations, for 30 min, room
temperature. the reaction was terminated by filtration
through whatman filters using a brandel harvester, and
radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. the experiments were performed in triplicate. data were
analyzed using the non-linear curve fitting program ebda/

mal effects were lower than that of the full agonist 5-ct
(pec50= 8.40 ± 0.03; emax = 394.5 ± 2.56% ) (fig. 2). among
the antipsychotics tested, nemonapride was the most efficacious. (table 1). raclopride stimulated basal [35s] gtp gs
binding only at a single, high (100 mm) concentration, which
precluded the estimation of emax and pec50 values by nonlinear regression.
olanzapine, org 5222, and tiospirone did not appear to
affect basal [35s] gtp g s binding. risperidone tended to
decrease basal [35s] gtp g s binding, but the size of the
effect precluded the calculation of a pec50 value.
 xxxd2956xxx , thioridazine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and
serindole, decreased basal [35s] gtp g s binding to a similar
extent (about 50% of basal [35s] gtp gs binding).
3.2. na+ dependency of  xxxd1422xxx  activity at h5-ht1a
receptors
the antipsychotics that either did not affect or decreased
basal [35s] gtpgs binding in the standard na + condition
were tested also in the low (no nacl added) na + condition,
in comparison with the 5-ht1a inverse agonists, way
100635, (+)-butaclamol, methiothepin, and spiperone. the
low na + condition did not appear to affect the potency of the
compounds to inhibit basal [35s] gtp gs binding, because
the pic50 values obtained under both conditions were highly
correlated (r = 0.99, slope = 0.86, p < 0.0001).
when nacl was omitted from the reaction buffer, the
emax value varied to an extent that differed among the
compounds (table 2, fig. 3). lowering the na + concentration decreased the emax value of raclopride by 28%. it
affected significantly the emax of spiperone, chlorpromazine,
serindole, and thioridazine by 48 – 50%, the emax value of
way 100635, risperidone, and  xxxd2956xxx  by16– 24%, and
appeared to affect the emax value haloperidol, methiotepin,
and (+)-butaclamol by 21– 26%. org 5222 and olanzapine
were inactive with or without nacl. although the na +
concentration affected the emax value of the various compounds in a different manner, it did not markedly affect their
rank order (spearman rank correlation r = 0.87, p < 0.0001).
in the absence of nacl, (s)-way 100135 (100 nm)
shifted the concentration –response curve of serindole, haloperidol, thioridazine, and chlorpromazine to decrease basal
[35s] gtpgs binding to the right with a pkb varying between
8.37 and 8.91 (fig. 4). these values are similar to the pkb of
(s)-way 100135 to shift the concentration –response curve
of 5-ct to the right in the presence of 100 mm nacl
[pkb = 8.33 ± 0.05, similar to the pki of (s)-way 100135 at
5-ht1a receptors, that is, 8.29] (table 3). (s)-way 100135
shifted the concentration –response curves of each of the
compounds to the right in an apparent parallel manner,

h5-ht1a receptor antagonist potencies (pkb) were calculated from the shift of the concentration – response curve of 5-ct by a single concentration of the
antagonist, in the presence of nacl. h5-ht1a affinity values (pki) were determined in competition experiments with [3h] 8-oh-dpat. the effects of the
compounds alone are also reported (emax). values are means ± s.e.m. of three to six determinations.

except that of  xxxd2956xxx , which was shifted not only to the
right, but also upward (the emax of  xxxd2956xxx  changed from
38.46 ± 1.76 to 71.66 ± 2.58) (fig. 4).
3.3. antagonist activity at h5-ht1a receptors
antagonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors was examined, in
standard na + conditions, by testing the ability of the compound, at a single concentration, to shift the concentration –
response curve of 5-ct to the right. the effects of 5-ct
could be antagonized with all the compounds listed in table
3, which all had affinity for 5-ht1a receptors, but exerted
different activity at these receptors, ranging from inverse

agonism via neutral antagonism to partial agonism. the pkb
values of the compounds to antagonize 5-ct (table 3)
correlated significantly but weakly with their pki values at
5-ht1a receptors (r = 0.67, p < 0.025). this weak correlation
is likely due to the marked variation among the compounds
with respect to the ratio of kb and ki, which ranged from 26.3
for spiperone to 0.004 for ziprasidone. note that all compounds with a 5-ht1a antagonist potency at least about 3fold higher than their 5-ht1a affinity (i.e. having a kb/ki
ratio greater than  3) were able to decrease basal [35s]
gtp g s binding when tested alone. such inverse agonism
was not observed with compounds that had a smaller kb/ki
ratio. compounds with a kb/ki ratio lower than 3 but higher
than 0.24 were inactive, and those with a kb/ki ratio of 0.24
or lower exerted agonist activity. together, the results
obtained with all compounds described in table 3 showed
emax values not to correlate significantly with either kb or ki
values (r =  0.28 and 0.40, respectively), but to correlate
strongly (r =  0.89, p < 0.0001) with the logarithm of the
kb/ki ratio (fig. 5). thus, a pkb value higher than the pki
appears to be predictive of  xxxd1422xxx  activity, similar
pkb and pki values suggest neutral antagonism, and pkb
values lower than the pki suggest agonist properties.

4. discussion

fig. 5. correlation between kb/ki ratio and efficacy of antipsychotics and  xxxg1108xxx  receptor ligands. compounds are indicated by the numbers listed in
table 3.

in agreement with previous reports, certain antipsychotics
exerted agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors and others
behaved as silent  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists. the main
finding of the present study is that several antipsychotics
(e.g. haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , chlorpromazine, thioridazine,

c. cosi, w. koek / european journal of pharmacology 433 (2001) 55–62

and  xxxd3195xxx ) exerted  xxxd1422xxx  activity at 5-ht1a
receptors. this  xxxd1422xxx  activity, which was na +
dependent, was shown by all the compounds whose potency
to antagonize the full agonist 5-ct was higher than its
affinity for 5-ht1a receptors.
when tested for their ability to affect basal [35s] gtp g s
binding to h5-ht1a expressed in ha7 cells, the antipsychotics, nemonapride, ziprasidone, and clozapine were
found to have  xxxg1108xxx  agonist properties, consistent
with previous reports (assié et al., 1997; seeger et al., 1995;
zorn et al., 1999).  xxxg1108xxx  agonist activity was
observed also with ocaperidone. from their maximal stimulation of basal [35s] gtp gs binding, the following efficacy
order was apparent: 5-ct > nemonapride > ziprasidone> clozapine > ocaperidone. because ziprasidone and clozapine
had similar affinities for h5-ht1a and hd2 receptors (newman-tancredi et al., 1998)  xxxg1108xxx  agonist activity
may play a role in their pharmacological profile.
olanzapine and org 5222 behaved as silent antagonists
at h5-ht1a receptors: they neither stimulated nor inhibited
basal [35s] gtp gs binding, either in the presence or in the
absence of added na + , and they antagonized the effects of 5ct with potencies similar to their affinity at 5-ht1a receptors. in the presence of added na + , tiospirone (a buspirone
analogue reportedly effective in the treatment of schizophrenia while having minimal extrapyramidal side-effects; jain et
al., 1987; moore et al., 1987) and risperidone behaved the
same as olanzapine and org 5222, that is, they neither
stimulated nor inhibited basal [35s] gtpgs binding, and they
antagonized the effects of 5-ct with potencies similar to
their affinity at 5-ht1a receptors. under low na + conditions, however, tiospirone and risperidone tended to decrease
basal [35s] gtp gs binding.
in agreement with previous reports, way 100635,
methiothepin, spiperone, and (+)-butaclamol were inverse
agonists at 5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et al., 1998;
mcloughlin and strange, 2000; cosi and koek, 2000). in
contrast with a previous report (newman-tancredi et al.,
1998) that described the conventional neuroleptics haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and  xxxd2956xxx , as neutral 5-ht1a
receptor antagonists, here they showed, together with thioridazine and  xxxd3195xxx , marked  xxxd1422xxx  activity at
h5-ht1a receptors as evidenced by their ability to decrease
basal [35s] gtp g s binding, which was enhanced in the
absence of added na + . they were all able to shift the
concentration – response curve of 5-ct to the right, and their
pkb value to antagonize 5-ct was higher than their pki at
h5-ht1a receptors, and ranging from about 3-fold higher for
haloperidol to almost 30-fold higher for spiperone. neutral
antagonists and partial agonists had a pkb similar to or lower
than their pki. the results obtained with all compounds
showed that the emax values in the [35s] gtpgs binding
assay correlate strongly (r =  0.89, p < 0.0001) with the kb/
ki ratio. this correlation supports the idea that a high kb/ki
ratio may be predictive of  xxxd1422xxx  activity, a kb/ki
ratio close to one predictive of neutral antagonism, and a

61

ratio lower than one predictive of agonist activity (newmantancredi et al., 1996).
the decrease of basal [35s] gtp g s binding caused by
some antipsychotics and  xxxg1108xxx  ligands was
enhanced by omitting nacl from the reaction buffer, without
affecting their ic50. the extent of the enhancement differed
among compounds. maximal inhibition to about 25% of
basal [35s] gtpgs binding was produced by  xxxd3195xxx  and
thioridazine, in the low na + condition. these results,
together with previous findings (see below), suggest that
there may be a limit to the extent to which basal [35s] gtp gs
binding can be inhibited that depends on the level and
efficacy of spontaneous receptor precoupling. for instance,
mcloughlin and strange (2000) recently reported that the
maximal effect of the  xxxd1422xxx , spiperone, was not
significantly affected by the concentration of na + in h5ht1a – cho cells, in contrast with the present results.
further, they reported that the basal level of [35s] gtpgs
binding in untransfected cho cells was about 35% lower
than that in transfected cells, suggesting that the maximum
effect a full  xxxd1422xxx  can exert in this system is about
35%. basal [35s] gtpgs binding in untransfected hela
cells, however, has been shown to be almost 70% lower than
in ha7 cells (cosi and koek, 2000). it is conceivable that
differences in g-protein pools account in part for these
differences between h5-ht1a – cho and ha7 cells. indeed,
the affinity of the  xxxg1108xxx  for the g protein asubunit gia3 is higher than that for the gia2 subunit (see
references in raymond et al., 1999). in hela cells, gia3 is
much more expressed than gia2 (which is almost undetectable by immunoblot), whereas in cho cells, there is
 9-fold more gia2 than gia3 (raymond et al., 1993); the
former could be a more favorable condition for spontaneous
receptor precoupling and consequently more favorable to
detect  xxxd1422xxx  activity. be that as it may, the observation that the difference of basal [35s] gtp g s binding
between transfected and untransfected cells is almost twice
as large in ha7 cells than in cho cells suggests that ha7
cells may afford a more sensitive measure of maximal effect
differences of inverse agonists at 5-ht1a receptors.
evidence for the involvement of 5-ht1a receptors in the
antipsychotics —induced decrease of basal [35s] gtpgs
binding, and further evidence for the existence of precoupling of 5-ht1a receptors in ha7 cells (cosi and koek,
2000) was provided by the observation that their effects
could be antagonized by a selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, (s)-way 100135. in the absence of na + , (s)-way
100135 (100 nm) shifted the concentration – response curves
of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, and  xxxd3195xxx ,
to the right (with a pkb similar to its pkb to shift the
concentration– response curve of 5-ct in the presence of
na + ), which indicates that the inverse activity of the compounds was mediated by 5-ht1a receptors. the concentration – response curve of  xxxd2956xxx , however, was shifted not
only rightward but also upward, suggesting that that the
 xxxd2956xxx -induced decrease of basal [35s] gtp g s binding

62

may involve interactions with sites other than the 5-ht1a
receptor.
the therapeutic relevance of the present data for several
drugs, including inverse agonists, is unclear since they acted
only at very high concentrations at 5-ht1a versus d2 sites
(see affinity values in transfected cho cells, newmantancredi et al., 1998; hall and strange, 1997). nevertheless,
the present finding that antipsychotics interact with 5-ht1a
receptors, and do so in a different manner, reinforces the idea
that  xxxg1108xxx  interactions could play an important
role in the pharmacological profile of certain antipsychotic
agents. in particular,  xxxg1108xxx  agonist properties
associated with balanced 5-ht1a/ xxxg656xxx  affinities
might be important for antipsychotic activity with less
extrapyramidal side effects. also, the results show that the
manner in which compounds interact with the 5-ht1a
receptor appears to be related to their kb/ki ratio. finally,
the present findings are further evidence that the nacl
concentration can affect the ability to detect  xxxd1422xxx 
activity at cloned human 5-ht1a receptors, likely by influencing receptor precoupling.
