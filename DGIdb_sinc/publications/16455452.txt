deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi-3k)/pdk-l/akt signaling cascade is associated
with pancreatic cancer tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. as such, it has been postulated that pdk-1/akt signaling inhibitors may hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for pancreatic
cancer. disadvantages of currently available akt inhibitors include tumor resistance, poor specificity, potential toxicity, and poor bioavailability. previous studies have demonstrated that osu-03012, a  xxxd457xxx 
derivative, specifically inhibits pdk-1 mediated phosphorylation of akt with ic50 values in the low mm
range. human pancreatic cancer cell lines aspc-1, bxpc-3, mia-paca 2, and panc-1 were cultured
in media containing varying concentrations of osu-03012, 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), and gemcitabine,
and changes in akt phosphorylation and cell viability were evaluated using western blotting and
a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay, respectively. treatment
with osu-03012 resulted in decreased pdk-1-mediated akt phosphorylation and cell growth inhibition for all cell lines with ic50 values ranging between 1.0 and 2.5 mm. resistance to 5-fu and gemcitabine was observed in cell lines aspc-1 and bxpc-3. further analyses indicate that osu-03012
induces both proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects in these cells. taken together, these data suggest that osu-03012 has potential value as a novel therapy for pancreatic cancer. ( j gastrointest

pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common
cancer-causing death in the united states1 and prognosis is almost universally dismal with currently reported five-year survival rates of only 4%.2 surgical
resection remains the only hope for cure, but most
patients present with locally advanced or metastatic
disease, factors that preclude attempts at resection.
chemotherapy and radiation offer only modest improvements in survival.3,4 novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed, and this topic has been
the subject of a recent progress review group sponsored by the national institutes of health.5
recent advances in pancreatic cancer research
have identified a number of tumorigenesis-associated
genetic events including akt activation.6â€“8 as a key
component in the pi3k/akt signaling pathway, activated akt is involved in the regulation of several important cellular events, including apoptosis, cellular
proliferation, and the response to hypoxic stress

(fig. 1). constitutive activation of akt has been reported in 78% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell
lines,9 and mutations in pten, a negative regulator
of akt activation, have also been identified in pancreatic tumor specimens.10â€“12 moreover, pi3k/aktinhibiting agents have been shown to induce
apoptosis in several pancreatic cancer cell lines
exhibiting akt activation.13â€“17 therefore, akt activation appears to represent a viable target for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic cancer.
we have recently identified a series of akt signaling inhibitors with high antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in human prostate cancer cell
lines and mouse xenografts.18 one of these, osu03012, has been approved by national institutes of

we hypothesize that treatment with osu-03012
will result in enhanced apoptosis and an antiproliferative effect through modulation of akt signaling in
pancreatic cancer cells. the purpose of the present
study was to evaluate the effects of osu-03012
treatment on pancreatic cancer cell growth, akt

cell viability assay
five thousand cells per well were seeded into a
96-well plate in media containing 10% fbs. after
incubation at 37  c, 5% co2 for 24 hours, cells
were treated with 1% fbs media containing various
concentrations of compounds and incubated at 37 
c for another 48 hours.18 cell viability was evaluated
using an mtt assay. briefly, 200 ul of 10% fbssupplemented medium containing mtt at a concentration of 75 mg/ml was added to each well, and cells
were incubated in the presence of mtt for 2 hours.
mitochondrial dehydrogenate activity reduced the
yellow mtt dye to a purple formazan, which was
then solubilized with 200 ul of dmso, and absorbance at 570 nm was read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) plate reader; 0.1% of
dmso was used as a control. for aspc-1 and
bxpc-3, the medium was rpmi1640, while dmem
was used for miapaca-2 and panc-1. the value of
ic50 was defined as the concentration at which cell
viability decreased to 50%. the experiments were
performed in six replicates.
western blotting
5

pancreatic cancer cells (5 3 10 ) were cultured in
a t-25 flask and incubated for 24 hours in the presence of 10% fbs. cells were treated with media
containing different concentrations of agents under
investigation, or 0.1% dmso (negative control)
for 4â€“24 hours. cells were collected by centrifugation at 6-hr intervals. following pbs washing, the
cells were resuspended in 200â€“400 ml of m-per lysate buffer. after being gently vortexed at room temperature for 10 minutes, the cells were centrifuged at
14,000 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes, and
the supernatants were transferred into new

209

eppendorf tubes and stored at 220  c. after protein
concentration determination using a bca kit, the
supernatants were mixed with 5 3 sds-page loading buffer and boiled at 100  c for 5 minutes. equal
amounts (50 mg) of the supernatants were loaded
onto 10% sds-page gels and separated by
electrophoresis.
proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes using a biorad mini-ii system. the
transblotted nitrocellulose membranes were washed
three times with tbs buffer (15 mm tris-borate0.15 m  xxxd3213xxx , ph 7.5) containing 0.05%
tween 20 (tbst), and then blocked with tbst containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for
2 hours. after incubation with the primary antibody
at a 1:1000 dilution in tbst-5% nonfat dry milk
at 4  c overnight, the membranes were washed three
times with tbst and probed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution in
tbst-5% nonfat dry milk for 1.5 hours at room temperature. immunoblots were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence using an ecl kit after washing
with tbst. for all western blot assays, actin was used
as an internal control.
cell growth inhibition analysis
pancreatic cancer cells were seeded into six-well
plates at 50,000-75,000 cells per well in 10% fbscontaining rpmi1640 or dmem media.18 after incubation at 37  c in 5% co2 for 24 hours, cells
were treated in duplicate with 1 mm or 5 mm of
osu-03012 in 10% fbs-containing media, and
the control groups were treated with 0.1% dmso.
cells were harvested by trypsin digestion at various time intervals and numerated using a coulter
counter (model zl d/t) (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca). the relative proliferation index was
defined as the ratio of osu-03012-treated cells to
dmso-treated cells for any given time point.
results
expression and phosphorylation of akt in
pancreatic cancer cell lines
because osu-03012 acts as a specific pdk-1 inhibitor, we first investigated the expression and
phosphorylation of akt in these cell lines by western
blotting. while high concentrations of akt were detected in the cell lysates of aspc-1, miapaca-2, and
panc-1, only basal levels were detected in the cell
lysate of bxpc-3 (fig. 3). furthermore, increased
concentrations of phosphorylated akt (ser473) were
detected only in the cell lysate of aspc-1, and phosphorylation of akt in miapaca-2 and panc-1

phosphorylation after treatment with varying concentrations of osu-03012. treatment with osu03012 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of
akt phosphorylation in all cell lines tested (fig. 5).
these findings indicate that osu-03012 specifically
and efficiently inhibits akt phosphorylation in pancreatic cancer cells regardless of basal akt phosphorylation status.18

lines.

approximated that of bxpc-3. in regards to the expression and phosphorylation of akt, these four cell
lines can be divided into three groups: (1) aspc-1
with high expression and phosphorylation of akt,
(2) miapaca-2 and panc-1 with high expression
but low phosphorylation akt, and (3) bxpc3 with
low expression and phosphorylation of akt.
osu-03012 inhibits the growth of all
tested pancreatic cancer cell lines
treatment with osu-03012 resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of cell viability for all pancreatic
cancer cell lines tested (fig. 4, a). in the presence of
5 mm of osu-03012, only trace cell viability was observed. although the four cell lines varied widely in
regards to expression and phosphorylation of akt
(fig. 3), effects on cell viability were comparable (table 1). while the ic50 values of aspc-1, bxpc-3,
and miapaca-2 are nearly identical (1.5 mm, 1.8
mm, and 1.3 mm, respectively), there was a moderate
increase in the ic50 value of panc-1 (2.3 mm).
osu-03012 appears to be an order of magnitude
more potent than  xxxd457xxx  (ic50 20â€“50 mm).22
as controls, two drugs commonly used for human
pancreatic cancer therapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and
gemcitabine, were also evaluated. results varied
among the four cell lines (fig. 4, b, c ). while miapaca-2 and panc-1 are sensitive to both 5-fu and
gemcitabine, aspc-1 is resistant to both 5-fu and
gemcitabine. bxpc-3 is sensitive to 5-fu but resistant to gemcitabine. osu-03012 demonstrated
more potent inhibition of cell proliferation than
either 5-fu or gemcitabine for all cell lines tested
(table 1).

osu-03012 induces antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects in all tested
pancreatic cancer cell lines
to investigate the biological consequences resulting from osu-03012-mediated inhibition of akt
phosphorylation, we examined the effects of osu03012 treatment on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation (fig. 6). in general, osu-03012 treatment
resulted in decreased cell proliferation in a time
and dose-dependent manner. the antiproliferative
effect of osu-03012 treatment was most pronounced in the miapaca-2 cell line. of note, the effects of osu-03012 on cell growth are strikingly
different in the presence of varying concentrations
of fbs. as demonstrated in the cell viability assay
(fig. 4, a), the cell growth of all four cell lines was
completely inhibited after incubation with media
containing 1% fbs and 5 mm of osu-03012 for
48 hours (2 days), while 40â€“60% of proliferation activity was retained after incubation with media containing 10% fbs and 5 um of osu-03012 for 3
days. this apparent inconsistency was also observed
in previous studies using pc-3 cells and may be attributed to serum-induced growth factor/receptor
 xxxg2198xxx -mediated activation of pi3k/akt signaling or altered cellular uptake of osu-03012.
finally, osu-03012-mediated changes in apoptosis were evaluated using a poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) cleavage assay18 (fig. 7). treatment
of all pancreatic cancer cell lines with osu-03012
resulted in a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis
as measured by parp cleavage. the proapoptotic
effect of osu-03012 did vary among cell lines and
was most pronounced in the aspc-1 and bxpc-3
cell lines. the findings indicate that osu-03012
treatment results in both antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in all tested pancreatic cancer cells.

uncontrolled cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis.23 after binding of the regulatory  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  subunit of pi3k to an activated receptor
 xxxg2198xxx , or through binding of the p110 catalytic subunit of pi3k to activated ras, pi3k is activated and subsequently leads to the translocation of
akt to the plasma membrane.7,8,24 the p110 subunit

of pi3k catalyzes the conversion of pip2 to pip3.
pip3 promotes phosphorylation of akt by  xxxg1718xxx 
and  xxxg1715xxx , at thr308 and ser473, respectively, resulting in full activation. activated akt ( xxxg118xxx   xxxg1890xxx , pkb) is involved in several important
cellular events including apoptosis, cellular proliferation, and the response to hypoxic stress.

antiapoptotic activity is partially mediated through
bad, ikb kinase, forkhead transcription factor, and
caspase-9. downstream regulators of cell cycle progression mediated by pi3k/akt include p21,
 xxxg978xxx , and p27. phosphorylation of  xxxg978xxx  inhibits its kinase activity and allows cyclin dl to accumulate.24 in addition, activated akt enhances expression
of hypoxia-inducible factor-1, resulting in increased
cellular hypoxia tolerance.25,26
a number of recent investigations support the
evalution of pi3k/akt pathway inhibitors as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic
cancer.7,8 the  xxxg147xxx  metabolite, 5(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(s)-hete), is known
to significantly stimulate the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells lines and markedly increases akt
phosphorylation.13 treatment of these cells with
the pi3k inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx , results in the
blockade of 5(s)-hete-induced akt phosphorylation and dna synthesis. inhibition of the antiapoptotic regulator,  xxxg1559xxx , has been reported to result
in potentiation of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in
a group of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer
cell lines.14 in this study, inhibition of the pi3k/
akt pathway by  xxxd2523xxx  did not result in an attenuation of  xxxg1559xxx  mediated apoptosis. furthermore,
basal akt activity did not correspond to gemcitabine
resistance. these findings suggest that gemcitabineinduced apoptosis may not be modulated by the pi3k/
akt pathway in certain pancreatic cancers. others
have reported, however, that pi3k/akt pathway inhibitors may induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell
lines.15â€“17 possible downstream mediators of apoptosis
following pi3k/akt inhibition in gemcitabine-treated
pancreatic cancer cells lines include  xxxg1559xxx , bcl-2,
and bax. pi3k/akt inhibition augments the proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects of  xxxg2296xxx  induced
 xxxg1559xxx  inhibition in several pancreatic cancer cell
lines. this suggests that the pi3k/akt pathway may,
in part, modulate  xxxg1559xxx  mediated chemoresistance
in pancreatic cancer. finally, treatment of pancreatic
cancer cells with  xxxd2523xxx  and the cyclooxygenase

cancer cell lines.

inhibitor,  xxxd3259xxx , resulted in enhanced growth inhibition, alteration of cell cycle distribution, and decreased apoptotic threshold as compared to
treatment with  xxxd3259xxx  alone.27
despite these potentially encouraging findings,
early generation pi3k/akt inhibitors exhibit a number of clinically significant disadvantages, including
poor specificity, potential toxicity, and poor bioavailability.7,8  xxxd3536xxx  is known to have unfavorable
pharmacokinetic properties. both  xxxd3536xxx  and
 xxxd2523xxx  are likely to have broad inhibitory activities and may have nonspecific effects on other regulatory cellular molecules. for example, there are
different isoforms of p110, the pi3k catalytic subunit.  xxxd3536xxx  and  xxxd2523xxx  exhibit inhibitory
activities against all of these isoforms, as well as distant pi3k-like kinases such as atm and atr. finally, delivery issues have precluded the study of
pi3k/akt inhibitors in available animal models of
pancreatic cancer.
in this study, all tested pancreatic cancer cell lines
demonstrated sensitivity to osu-03012. the ic50
values (1.5â€“2.5 mm) are an order of magnitude lower
than those previously reported values for other
pi3k/akt inhibitors.7,8,27,28 the high potency of
osu-03012 appears to be mediated through both
antiproliferative and proapoptotic mechanisms.18 it
has been previously reported that inhibition of
pdk-1/akt signaling represents the underlying antitumor mechanism for osu-03012 in pc-3 cells.18
considering the conserved role of pdk-1/akt signaling in cell proliferation and survival, we believe
that a similar molecular mechanism underlies the
high antitumor activity of osu-03012 in different
pancreatic cancer cell lines. our data are further

supported by antitumor screening studies of osu03012 in the developmental therapeutic program
at the national cancer institute.18 osu-03012
demonstrated potent growth inhibition in 60 cell
lines from human lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast,
prostate, kidney, leukemia, and melanoma cancers
with a mean ic50 value of 1.2 mm. while it is still
unclear whether antiproliferative or proapoptotic effects are predominant in specific cancer cell lines, the
bifunctionality of osu-03012 appears to counteract
cell resistance.
the data presented here indicate that osu-03012
uniformly inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth and
suggest that this effect is mediated by inhibition of

akt phosphorylation. the widely varying effects of
5-fu and gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer cell
growth undoubtedly are a result of heterogeneity
among various cell lines with regards to their mechanisms of action.27,28 this may explain why these
agents have demonstrated only limited clinical activity for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. these results support further investigation of this novel
therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer therapy in
preclinical and clinical studies.
