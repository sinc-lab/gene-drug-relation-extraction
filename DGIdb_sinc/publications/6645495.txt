summary-with
the aim of finding an explanation
for the biological properties of progestagens
currently
used for contraceptive
purposes,
we have assessed their specificity for progesterone,
androgen
and
oestrogen receptors in mcf-7 cells. the specificity of progestagens for the progesterone receptors in the
cytosol fraction of mcf-7 cells was similar to that for progesterone
receptors in human and rabbit
myometrial
cytosol but different from that for the progesterone
receptor in rat myometrial
cytosol. at
37’c the relative affinity of  xxxd2067xxx ,
the major metabolite of  xxxd1849xxx , for the progesterone
receptor in intact mcf-7 cells was twice that of levonorgestrel
and org 2058, three times that of
medroxy-progesterone
acetate (mpa), 4.5 times that of  xxxd2751xxx 
and 5 times that of progesterone
and cyproterone
acetate whereas at 4°c in the cytosol fraction of mcf-7 cells exposed to molybdate
(nontransformed
receptor complexes)
 xxxd2067xxx 
and org 2058 displayed similar affinity. the
stronger binding of  xxxd2067xxx 
in intact cells was due to the higher stability of its complex wtth the
progesterone
receptor.
at 37°c the relative affinity of 3-kcto- xxxd1849xxx 
for the androgen
receptor in
intact mcf-7 cells was half that of lcvonorgestrel.
similar to that of  xxxd2751xxx 
and  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) and at least three times higher than that of progestagens
with anti-androgenic
activity
whereas at 4yz in the cytosol fraction exposed to molybdatc
there was no clear difference between the
relative affinities of progestagens
with androgenic
and anti-androgcnic
propertics.
of the progestagens
tested in this study, only norethinodrel
displayed
measurable
but very low relative affinity for the
oestrogen
receptor in mcf-7 cells. we conclude that the present results of binding studies wtth intact
mcf-7 cells correlate better with the known hormonal properties
of progcstagens
than those obtained
with the cytosol fraction exposed to molybdate
at 3°c.

introduction

clinical studies and experiments
in animals have
shown that synthetic progestagens
not only display
progestational
activity but may also display oestrogenic, androgenic
or anti-androgenic
activity [ xxxd745xxx . in general the biological potency of these steroid
hormones
has been found to be related to their
affinity for cytoplasmic
receptors
and the different
hormonal
activities of progestagens

traceptive purpose have been explained on the basis of
their interaction
with different receptor sites [2, 51.
however such a correlation between biological activity and cytoplasmic
receptor binding is not always
adequate to define the activity of these compounds.
for instance binding studies with androgen receptors
in the cytosol
fraction
cannot
be used
for
differentiating
the androgenic
and anti-androgenic
properties of progestagens
[6, 71. several factors may
account for this. firstly metabolism
and binding to
plasma proteins play an important role. secondly the
competitive binding technique performed at 4’c in a
cytosol fraction
has its limitations.
the relative
affinities of strong progestagens
for the progesterone
receptor may be underestimated
when tested at 4c
even after relatively long periods of incubation since
equilibrium
may still not be reached [s-lo]. the
specificity of receptor binding may be temperaturedependent [ 1 l] and results at 4’c do not reflect physiological conditions. moreover in the cytosol fraction
only initial binding to the receptor can be measured
whereas subsequent steps such as transformation
of
the complex and nuclear binding are also important
for biological activity. only the transformed
complex
will trigger the hormonal response in the nucleus as
has been found for unresponsive
mutant cells with a
defective transformation
system for the  xxxg183xxx  [ 121.

in the present study we have estimated the binding
of progestagens
in intact human mcf-7 cells at 37°c
and in a cytosol preparation
of these cells to investigate the relationship
between binding affinity results
and the known clinical effects of these progestagens.
a apecitic consideration
in this study was the use of
molybdate in the cytosol buffer; this stabilizes receptors [13] and blocks the transformation
of receptor
complexes
[1417].
this enabled
us to estimate
receptor affinities under more defined conditions.

[“h]org
2058, [‘hiprogesterone
and [3h]17boestradiol were about 80, 100. 75 and 80% respectively. more than 90% of the bound radioactivity
remaining
after charcoal treatment
of the cellular
extract incubated for 45 min at 37°c accounted for
the unmetabolized
tritiated
steroids used in this
study. we conclude
that a period of incubation
shorter than 45 min may be insufficient
to allow
equilibrium to be reached for intracellular
receptor
binding whereas longer periods lead to extensive
metabolism of some of the ligands used in this study
as has been reported previously [18].
we have developed a freeze-thaw/high-salt
extraction procedure
followed by a dextran-coated
charcoal method in low salt because binding studies with
intact cells without these procedures are limited by a
very high level of nonspecific binding. the present
procedures
resulted
in combined
extraction
and
detection of the extra-nuclear
fraction and the highsalt extractable
nuclear fraction with less than 30%
interference
by non-specific binding sites. when the
mcf-7 cells were incubated with [‘h]17@ xxxd2037xxx 
or (‘hisa-dihydrotestosterone
less than 10% of the
specifically bound cellular label was found in the
extra-nuclear
compartment
compared to the amount
present in the total cellular extract. however when
the cells were incubated
with [jh]org 2058 about
40% of the label was found to be of extra-nuclear
origin. thus a fraction of the receptor complexes
present in the cellular extract was from extra-nuclear
origin; the percentage varied depending on the tracer
used.

in the next set of experiments
we analyzed the
displacement
of [3h] xxxd3240xxx 
(4 nm)
and [sh]l7poestradiol(4
nm) from the androgen and
oestrogen receptors in mcf-7 cytosol using increasing concentrations
of different
progestagens.

reference
compound
 xxxd2631xxx 
prevented
very
the
binding
of
[3h]5ueffectively
dihydrotestosterone
for the human  xxxg183xxx  as has been previously reported [ 19-221. testosterone
was a less effective
competitor
for the
androgen
receptor
(table 3). the various progestagens only displayed
moderate
to low relative
affinity for the cytosolic human  xxxg183xxx .
all but one of the progestagens
used in this study
were found to have unmeasurably
low affinity for the
 xxxg730xxx  in the cytosol fraction of mcf-7
cells. only norethinodrel
displayed measurable
hut
low (0.8%) relative affinity (table 3).
intact cells (spc)
the specificities of the progestagens
for the extractable progesterone,
androgen and oestrogen receptors present in intact cells are summarized
in
table 3. the ranking of the relative affinities for the
progesterone
receptor
was as follows:

(table 3). the only progestagens
tested in this study
with detectable affinity for the  xxxg730xxx  in
intact mcf-7 cells was norethinodrel
(table 3).

about 60 min, whereas faster rates of dissociation
were found for levonorgestrel
and org 2058 (about 30
min). the stability of the [‘hiprogesterone
receptor
complex was much lower: only 10% of the initial
complex was found after a 15 min chase at 37°c.

previous studies have shown that progestagens
currently used for contraceptive
purposes interact
with the progesterone
receptor in human myometrium [s, 23-271. competitive
binding studies using
the  xxxg183xxx  in human and rat prostate [2,
3] and in mouse kidney [7, 271 indicated
that a
number of progestagens
also display some affinity for
the  xxxg183xxx .
studies with the oestrogen
receptor from human and rabbit myometrium
indicated that some progestagens
(e.g. lynestrenol
and
norethinodrel)
display a low but measurable affinity
for the  xxxg730xxx  [sl.
in a previous study [s] we found that the results
obtained with cytosolic receptor preparations
may
explain some of the clinical characteristics
of progestagens.
however the results of binding studies
performed
at 4°c in a cytosol fraction do not always
reflect the potency of test compounds in \+\w[7. 271
and in the present study we have investigated
the
binding
characteristics
of progestagens
in intact
mcf-7 cells at 37°c and in the cytosol fraction
prepared at 1°c from these cells. we selected mcf-7
cells since these cells contain human progesterone,
oestrogen
and androgen
receptors
1281 and since

the strong
competitive
potency
of  xxxd2067xxx 
for the progesterone
receptor in intact
mcf-7 cells as shown in table 3 and the very low
equilibrium dissociation constant as shown in table 1
could be due to either a high stability of the  xxxd2067xxx  receptor complex or a relatively fast rate
constant for association.
in order to gain a better
understanding
of the kinetics of interaction between
 xxxd2067xxx 
and its receptor.
mcf-7 cells
were incubated
at 37°c with either [‘hj3-ketodesogestrel.

or

and after the receptor-binding
sites
were fully occupied (45 min) an excess of nonradioactive org 2058 was added. at different time points the
amount of specifically bound tritiated steroid in the
high salt extraction buffer was estimated. the results
in fig. 1 shows that at 37°c the half-life of dissociation of the  xxxd2067xxx

binding

of progestagens

to receptor

oestrogens
and androgens
are known
to have specific effects on these cells [29, 301.
the specificity of progesterone
receptors present
in the cytosol fraction of mcf-7 cells was similar to
that of progesterone
receptors in human myometrial
cytosol. this is in agreement
with the results of a
previous study showing that the specificity of progesterone receptors found in different target issues of
the same species are identical [31]. the specificity of
the progesterone
receptors
in human and rabbit
myometrial
cytosol
was also comparable
and
confirms previous findings [.5.24,27]. however the
specificity
of the progesterone
receptor
in rat
myometrium
was different
from that in human
tissues.
the relative affinities of the progestagens
used in
this study for the progesterone
receptor
in intact
mcf-7 cells corresponded
well with those found for
the progesterone
receptor in mcf-7 cytosol exposed
to molybdate.
indicating that the initial binding step
in the cytoplasm is important. molybdate is known to
block the transformation
of the progesterone
receptor complex 1161.  xxxd2067xxx 
displayed
a
much higher relative affinity at 37°c in intact cells
than in cytosol at 4°c. at 4°c  xxxd2067xxx .
levonorgestrel
and org 2058 displayed
a similar
competitive potency for the binding of [jh]org 20.58
to the human progesterone
receptor whereas at 37°c
in intact cells  xxxd2067xxx 
competed
more
strongly than levonorgestrel
and org 20.58. this
difference was due to a higher stability of the binding
of  xxxd2067xxx 
to the progesterone
receptor
and is in agreement with the values estimated for the
equilibrium
dissociation
constants.
this difference
may explain the stronger progestational
activity of
 xxxd2067xxx 
compared to that of levonorgestrel in clinical studies [32. 331.
the relative affinities of the androgenic reference
compounds
 xxxd2631xxx 
and testosterone
for the
 xxxg183xxx  in intact mcf-7 cells were similar
to those estimated in the cytosol fraction exposed to
molybdate.
molybdate
is also known to block the
transformation
of the androgen
receptor complex
[ 171. thus unlike intact cells with transformed receptor complexes who bind to dna-cellulose
(results
not shown) the cytosol exposed to molybdate
only
contained nontransformed
 xxxg183xxx  complexes who did not bind to dna-cellulose
(results
not shown).
apparently
transformation
of the
 xxxg183xxx  complex in mcf-7 cells is not a
limiting step for the biological activity of strong
androgen
agonists like  xxxd2631xxx 
( xxxd2631xxx ) and
testosterone.
it may however be a limiting step for
the progestagens
with anti-androgenic
properties
such as cyproterone
acetate, chlormadinone
acetate
and  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate since these compounds
displayed a much lower relative affinity for the androgen
receptor in intact cells than that for the androgen
receptor in the cytosol fraction exposed to molybdate. progestagens

trel) and weak (e.g.  xxxd2067xxx 
and mpa)
androgenic
activity displayed slightly lower relative
affinity for the  xxxg183xxx  in intact cells than
in cytosol exposed to molybdate the difference was
not nearly as large as that observed for progestagens
with known anti-androgenic
activities. the present
study confirms that investigations
carried out only at
4°c do not discriminate between anti-androgenic
and
androgenic properties as previously reported [7, 27).
however a combination
of investigations
carried out
in intact cells at 37°c and in cytosol preparation
of
mcf-7 cells (4°c) exposed to molybdate can distinguish androgenic
from anti-androgenic
activity. the
most likely explanation
for this difference
is that
transformation
of receptor complexes changes the
specificity of anti-androgens
for the  xxxg183xxx  and that compounds with anti-androgenic
activity
not only may stabilize the  xxxg183xxx  complex in an inactive form as has been suggested for the
mode of action of the anti-oestrogen
tamoxifen [34]
or in a form unable to undergo translocation
[35] but
also may have a very low affinity for the binding site
of sa-dihydrotestosterone
on the transformed
receptor complex in the nucleus. such an explanation may
suggest an allosteric model which has been proposed
to explain agonistic and antagonistic
features
of
certain pregnene derivatives [36].
in a previous study [s] a difference
was found
between the relative affinities of  xxxd2067xxx ,
levonorgestrel
and  xxxd2751xxx 
for the androgen
receptor in cytosol prepared from rat prostate. in the
present study similar differences were found between
the relative
affinities
of levonorgestrel.
 xxxd2067xxx 
and  xxxd2751xxx 
for the androgen
receptor in the cytosol fraction and in intact mcf-7
cells. these differences may explain the differences
in androgenic properties of these compounds [33.37]
as suggested before [s].
in conclusion binding studies (together with other
factors such as binding to plasma proteins or rate of
metabolism)
with mcf-7 cells may help to explain
the different
hormonal
activities
of some progestagens in current use.
