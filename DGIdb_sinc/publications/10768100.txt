abstract
aims/hypothesis. increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) concentrations are characteristic for subjects with insulin resistance and could
contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this
state. in this study, we investigated the effect of troglitazone, a ligand of the nuclear receptor peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor-g, on pai-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes.
methods. we used two models: in vitro differentiated
subcutaneous and omental adipocytes cultured under
serum-free conditions and isolated subcutaneous and
omental fat cells kept in suspension culture. plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein was measured by
elisa, pai-1 mrna by a semiquantitative rtpcr technique.
results. exposure of in vitro differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from young normal-weight females
to 1 mg/ml troglitazone for 72 h caused a reduction of
both pai-1 secretion (by 29  5 %; p < 0.01) and

pai-1 mrna expression (by 26  3 %; p < 0.05). in
cultures from severely obese subjects, troglitazone induced a decrease of pai-1 antigen secretion from
newly differentiated omental adipocytes by 49  8 %
(p < 0.01) and from subcutaneous adipocytes by
30  7 % (p < 0.05). exposure of freshly isolated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes in suspension culture to troglitazone induced a similar reduction of
pai-1 concentration in the culture medium (by
35  11 %, p < 0.05. and 33  8 %, p < 0.05 compared
with control, respectively).
conclusion/interpretation. this study provides evidence that troglitazone reduces pai-1 production in
human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional
level. this observation could point to a new beneficial effect of troglitazone, particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk. [diabetologia (2000) 43: 377±383]

ol [1]. among the multiple mechanisms which could
explain the relation between insulin resistance and
cardiovascular disease, disorders of the fibrinolytic
system seem to play an important part [2]. the impairment of fibrinolysis in insulin resistance and
type ii diabetes is characterized by increases in plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (pai-1) antigen
and its activity [2]. increased plasma concentrations
of pai-1 are observed particularly in subjects with
an abdominal distribution of adipose tissue [3±5],
but are also positively associated with other components of the insulin-resistance syndrome [5±8]. although liver and endothelial cells are considered to
be major sources of plasma pai-1 [9, 10], recent stud-

378

ies have shown that adipose tissue, especially in the
visceral depot, produces substantial amounts of  xxxg2058xxx  and could contribute to the increased pai-1 concentrations in obesity [11±15].
thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone are new
insulin sensitizing agents that have favourable effects
on many components of the insulin-resistance syndrome, lowering not only plasma glucose but also hyperinsulinaemia and triglycerides and decreasing
blood pressure [16±18]. recently, it has been reported that treatment of a small group of type ii diabetic
patients with troglitazone for 6 months significantly
reduced plasma pai-1 concentrations [19]. moreover,
another group showed that treatment of women with
the polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) with troglitazone significantly decreased plasma pai-1 protein
concentration and activity [20]. very recently, it has
been shown that troglitazone and pioglitazone inhibit
pai-1 expression and secretion in human endothelial
cells after  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation [21].
irrespective of these observations, it is currently
not known whether troglitazone affects pai-1 production in human adipose tissue, the main site of thiazolidinedione action and a major source of increased
plasma pai-1 concentrations in the insulin-resistance
syndrome. therefore, it was the aim of this study to
investigate the effect of troglitazone on pai-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes.

materials and methods
materials. collagenase cls type 1 was obtained from worthington (freehold, n. j., usa);  xxxd2364xxx  and cortisol
were kindly donated by hoechst marion roussel (frankfurt,
germany);  xxxd2193xxx  was purchased from sigma (munich,
germany); troglitazone was kindly donated by sankyo (tokyo, japan); the pai-1 elisa kit was purchased from wak
chemie (hamburg, germany); trizol, superscript rt reverse transcriptase, random hexamers, taq polymerase, pcr
buffer, dctp,  xxxd1837xxx , dttp,  xxxd1148xxx  and culture media were obtained from gibco (berlin, germany); all other chemicals
were from boehringer (mannheim, germany) or merck
(darmstadt, germany). sterile plasticware for tissue culture
was purchased from flow laboratories (irvine, scotland).
subjects. subcutaneous adipose tissue samples (10 to 80 g wet
weight) were obtained from the mammary adipose tissue of
ten young normal-weight women (bmi < 26 kg/m2, age-range
19 to 40 years) undergoing surgical mammary reduction. in addition, we also collected abdominal subcutaneous and omental
adipose tissue samples (2 to 15 g wet weight) from ten extremely obese people (bmi: 44.6 ± 8.7 kg/m2, age-range 26 to
52 years) who underwent vertical gastric banding for weight
reduction. all subjects were of caucasian origin and did not
suffer from acute infection, cancer or any other consuming disease. informed consent was obtained from all subjects. tissue
collection was approved by the ethical committee of the heinrich-heine-university düsseldorf.
isolation and culture of stromal cells. the adipose tissue samples were transported in dmem/ xxxd2143xxx . the

h. gottschling-zeller et al.: troglitazone reduces pai-1 production
stromal cell fraction was isolated by collagenase digestion as
described previously [22]. the isolated cells were suspended
in dmem/ xxxd2143xxx  (vol/vol, 50:50), supplemented
with 10 % fetal calf serum. after cell adhesion for 16 h cultures
were kept under serum-free, hormone-supplemented conditions to allow adipose differentiation [22]. during the 16-day
culture period 40 to 70 % of the stromal cells underwent morphological adipose differentiation. cells were defined as adipocytes differentiated in vitro when their cytoplasma was completely filled with small or large lipid droplets which can be
easily detected under the microscope. cultures were then incubated with troglitazone (0.1 or 1 mg/ml) for the times indicated.
human adipocytes in suspension culture. human adipose tissue samples were transported in dmem/ xxxd2143xxx 
containing 4 % bsa. fat cells were isolated by collagenase digestion according a method reported previously [23] with
some modifications to minimize traumatization of the fragile
adipocytes. after enzymatic disaggregation of the tissue, the
floating adipocyte layer was washed three times with pbs buffer containing 4 % bsa. finally, the fat-cell solution was filtered through a nylon mesh of 280 mm pore size.
after isolation, the sizes and numbers of fat cells were determined in diluted aliquots. the assessment of mean fat-cell
diameter was based on at least 150 cells from each adipose tissue sample. the mean fat-cell volume was calculated from the
diameter.
the freshly isolated fat cells were incubated in dmem/
 xxxd2143xxx  containing 4 % bsa in the absence or
presence of troglitazone (0.1 or 1 mg/ml final concentration)
for 24 h at 37 °c in a smoothly shaking waterbath at a dilution
of 1:10.
for assessment of fat-cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase
was assayed in the culture medium after 2 h, 6 h and 24 h of incubation. no statistically significant change of ldh activity
was observed during the 24-h period (data not shown).
rna extraction. we prepared rna from primary cultures and
suspension culture according to a rna isolation technique described previously [24]. cells were harvested in trizol and
200 ml chloroform was added to newly differentiated adipocytes per dish or 500 ml to a sample of isolated fat cells, respectively. after centrifugation for 15 min at 12000 g, the aqueous
phase was mixed with an equal volume of isopropylalcohol.
after 12 h at ±20 °c, the rna was pelleted for 15 min at
10000 g, redissolved in licl4, washed twice with 70 % ethanol,
dried and redissolved in h2o. the purity of the rna yield
was verified by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde containing
agarose gel.
cdna generation and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). total
rna was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in h2o and 1st strand cdna
was prepared using 5 ml of rna, superscript rt reverse transcriptase and random hexamers according to the instructions
of the manufacturer. then 2.5 ml of cdna and a pcr primer
mix containing 2 u taq polymerase in pcr buffer, 200 mmol/l
of dctp,  xxxd1837xxx , dttp,  xxxd1148xxx  and 500 pmol/l of each primer
were diluted in a 50 ml volume and 50 ml  xxxd2648xxx  were added. pcr condition was a denaturating step at 94 c for 2 min
followed by 30 cycles of 94 °c, 30 s; 51 °c, 30 s; 72 °c, 45 s for
the detection of pai-1 mrna. polymerase chain reaction
products were transferred on a 2 % tbe-agarose gel, stained
with ethidiumbromid and were analysed using the lumianalyst system from boehringer (mannheim, germany).
for the semiquantificative analysis, two primer sets were
used simultaneously in the same tube: one primer set was spe-

confirmed using the abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (perkin elmer, weiterstadt,
germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
immunhistochemical staining of cd-31 and pai-1 in newly differentiated adipocytes. to detect a possible contamination by
endothelial cells, the stromal fraction from omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue was cultured on cell chamber slides
(becton dickinson, franklin lakes, n. j., usa) for up to
16 days. immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using
a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against cd-31 (dako,
carpentina, calif., usa) and a primary sheep polyclonal antibody (chemicon, temecula, calif., usa) directed against
pai-1. after washing with pbs, the newly differentiated fat
cells were fixed with ethanol containing 10 % methanol.
then, cell cultures were subjected to the protocol of dako
(lsab kit, carpentina, calif., usa). to determine the specificity of the immunostaining procedure, cells were also incubated in the absence of the primary antibody. finally, the slides
were counterstained with haematoxylin for 30 s, rinsed with
tap water, mounted in entellan (merck, darmstadt, germany)
and examined using an em109 microscope (carl zeiss, jena,
germany). the specificity of the antibodies was also controlled by staining huvec cultures (obtained from dr. p. rösen from diabetes research institute, biochemical department, düsseldorf) using the same protocol.
measurement of pai-1 protein. the culture medium for the determination of pai-1 protein was stored at ±80 c. we assayed
pai-1 protein using a commercially available specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (elisa, wak-chemie, hamburg, germany). the inter-assay and intra-assay
variations were less than 10 % and 5 %, respectively.

results
effects of troglitazone on pai-1 secretion and expression by newly differentiated adipocytes. basal pai-1
secretion from subcutaneous adipocytes differentiated in vitro was 57.1  7.0 ng × ml±1 × 72 h±1. a positive
correlation between the percentage of differentiated
cells and the concentration of pai-1 released was
found (r = 0.97; p < 0.05). when 1 mg/ml troglitazone
was added to the culture medium of subcutaneous adipocytes differentiated in vitro from eight subjects,
pai-1 secretion was reduced by 29  5 % compared
with control cultures (p < 0.01) (fig. 1). a smaller,
but also statistically significant inhibitory effect was
seen in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml troglitazone (by
18  3 %, p < 0.01) (fig. 1). lower concentrations of
troglitazone did not statistically significantly affect
pai-1 secretion (data not shown). exposure of differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from three subjects
to 1 mg/ml troglitazone for different periods of time
caused a decrease of pai-1 secretion into the culture
medium: by 21  6 %, ns, after 2 hours; by 11  1 %,
p < 0.05. after 6 h; by 18  1 %, ns, after 24 h; by
17  12 %, ns, after 48 h and by 28  5 %, p < 0.05.
after 72 h of incubation, respectively.
to find out whether troglitazone affects pai-1 production at the mrna expression, we studied the effect of the compound on steady-state pai-1 mrna
expression in newly differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from three subjects. a 72-h incubation with
1 mg/ml troglitazone caused a reduction in the expression of pai-1 mrna by 26  3 % (p < 0.05) (fig. 2).

sentially free of endothelial cells [22]. immunohistochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody
against cd-31 was negative in all cultures obtained
from omental as well as from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, arguing against a relevant contamination by endothelial cells. furthermore, staining of
the cultures with a polyclonal antibody against pai-1
revealed a positive reaction only in differentiated adipocytes (data not shown).

one on pai-1 secretion, we additionally investigated
the effect of the thiazolidinedione on pai-1 secretion
from abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipocytes differentiated in vitro in paired samples from
four extremely obese subjects. the reduction of
pai-1 secretion after an exposure to 1 mg/ml troglitazone for 72 h was greater in cultures of omental adipocytes (by 49  8 %; p < 0.01 compared with control
cultures) than in cultures of subcutaneous adipocytes
(by 30  7 %; p < 0.05 compared with control cultures) (fig. 3a). the relative reduction by troglitazone was, however, not statistically different between
the two depots.
human adipocytes that are differentiated in vitro
are a valuable model to study the long-term regulation of adipose tissue metabolism. because the total
stromal cell fraction is cultured, it cannot, however,
be excluded that other cell-types present in adipose
tissue contribute to the effect we observed. therefore, we did additional experiments for clarification.
one approach was to determine a possible contamination of the stromal fraction by endothelial cells.
previous immunohistochemical studies had already
shown that the subcutaneous stromal fraction is es-

effect of troglitazone on pai-1 secretion by isolated
adipocytes kept in suspension culture. to obtain further evidence that the effect of troglitazone is specifically exerted in adipocytes, we studied the effect of
the compound in an in vitro model of isolated fat cells
maintained in suspension culture which was free of
other contaminating cell-types. the basal rate of
pai-1 antigen secretion into the culture medium was
lower in isolated subcutaneous abdominal fat cells
than in isolated omental adipocytes (82.2  33.4
vs 183.5  95.6 ng × 106 fat cells±1 × 24 h±1; n = 6;
p < 0.05). to further investigate a possible depot-specific difference in the inhibitory effect of troglitazone
on pai-1 secretion, we incubated isolated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes in paired samples from
six extremely obese subjects with 1 mg/ml troglitazone for 24 h. this treatment caused a similar decrease
of pai-1 protein concentration in the culture medium
from both subcutaneous (by 35  11 %, p < 0.05) and
omental adipocytes (by 33  8 %, p < 0.05) (fig 3b).
a moderate, but not significant decrease of pai-1 secretion from abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes was
already detectable at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
troglitazone (by 26  8 %; n = 3; ns).
we also studied the effect of troglitazone on  xxxg2058xxx  mrna expression in isolated abdominal subcutaneous fat cells from three subjects. a 24-h incubation
with 1 mg/ml troglitazone caused only a small but not
significant reduction in the expression of  xxxg2058xxx  mrna (by 11  5 %, ns).

discussion
in this study, we analysed the effect of troglitazone on
pai-1 production in human fat cells using two in vitro
models: newly differentiated subcutaneous and
omental adipocytes cultured under serum-free, hormone-supplemented conditions and freshly isolated
adipocytes from subcutaneous and omental adipose
tissue maintained for 24 h in suspension culture. the
first model has the advantage of allowing the investigation of long-term effects under stable conditions
and providing a reliable preparation of rna. it
should be noted that despite the limited percentage
of full differentiation the stromal cell fraction is a homogenous population according to morphological
criteria, i. e. there is an accumulation of very small lip-

id inclusions [26]. the second model is characterized
by an almost pure preparation of fat cells but is not
so ideal for long-term tissue culture. both methods
gave very similar results clearly indicating that troglitazone reduces pai-1 expression and secretion in
cultured human adipocytes.
increased plasma pai-1 concentrations have been
reported to be characteristic for the insulin-resistance
syndrome [2, 13, 14], although the mechanisms linking the two conditions are still not clear. one plausible explanation is that an increased adipose expression of  xxxg2296xxx  and tgf-b could mediate the link between insulin resistance and increased pai-1 in obesity [27]. the clinical relevance of this association is unambigous, as increased plasma concentrations of
pai-1 have been found to be a cardiovascular risk
factor in epidemiological studies [2, 7]. therefore it
is important to establish how drugs that are advocated for the treatment of insulin resistance affect  xxxg2058xxx  concentrations.
thiazolidinediones are activators of peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor (ppar-g) a nuclear
receptor [28], and are a new class of oral hypoglycaemic drugs that enhance the insulin action.
these agents were found to reduce insulin resistance
in obese and type ii diabetic subjects by increasing
insulin-dependent glucose uptake and reducing hepatic glucose output [18], thereby reducing hyperglycaemia, raised insulin and triglyceride concentrations and hypertension [16±18]. recently, a beneficial effect of troglitazone, a member of the class of
thiazolidinediones, has been shown on both impaired fibrinolysis and activated coagulation associated with type ii diabetes [19]. in that study, treatment of diabetic patients with 200±600 mg/day troglitazone for 6 months led to a statistically significant
decrease of plasma pai-1 concentrations [19]. another recent study investigated the effect of troglitazone in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, who were characterized by defects in insulin
action, insulin secretion, ovarian steroidogenesis
and fibrinolysis. treatment with troglitazone for
12 weeks also caused a decrease in plasma pai-1
protein and activity [20]. despite these clear-cut effects, these clinical studies cannot show which sites
of pai-1 production are involved and which mechanisms are responsible for the decrease of pai-1 by
troglitazone treatment.
recent studies suggested that human adipocytes
are an important source of pai-1 [13, 14]. increased
circulating pai-1 concentrations were associated
with increased fat-cell size and fat mass in humans indicating that adipose tissue contributes to the increased pai-1-concentrations found in obesity [14].
our results clearly indicate that the decrease in
pai-1 concentrations after treatment with troglitazone is at least in part due to a suppression of pai-1
production by adipocytes.

381

in newly differentiated adipocytes, the inhibitory
effect of troglitazone on pai-1 secretion was at maximum only after 72 h. the first statistically significant
reduction of pai-1 release was, however, already observed after a 6-h exposure to the compound. in
freshly isolated adipocytes in suspension culture the
relative inhibitory effect of troglitazone was similar
in both subcutaneous and omental adipocytes, although the absolute decrease in pai-1 secretion was
greater in omental fat cells due to their greater secretory rate [13, 14]. in cultures of differentiated adipocytes from omental adipose tissue the down-regulation of pai-1 release was moderately more pronounced than in cultures of the stromal fraction
from subcutaneous adipose tissue, but this small difference was not statistically significant. note even in
abdominal obesity most of pai-1 secretion is from
subcutaneous fat cells because of the much larger tissue mass compared with the omental depots.
the results of our experiments also indicate that
the reduction of pai-1 expression and secretion by
troglitazone is not due to effects on other cell-types.
cultures of the stromal cell fraction from both adipose tissue depots were free of contamination by endothelial cells, which are also a potential source of
pai-1 [10]. additional immunohistochemical experiments done in this study further argue against a statistically significant contamination by endothelial cells
in cultures from subcutaneous and omental adipose
tissue. although it cannot be completely excluded
that other possibly contaminating cell-types such as
smooth muscle cells could contribute to the pai-1 release of the cultures, their relative contribution is
probably rather low.
it was recently reported that exposure of tnf-astimulated vascular endothelial cells to thiazolidindiones for 24 h resulted in an inhibition of pai-1 expression and secretion possibly through a ppar-gmediated mechanism, whereas basal secretion was
not statistically significantly reduced [21]. the
ppar-g, the cellular target of troglitazone is expressed in a relative adipose-selective fashion in
both rodents and humans, but is also expressed in a
variety of other tissues [29]. in another recent study
ppar-g activation in human endothelial cells was
followed by an increased expression of pai-1 and it
was hypothesized from this in vitro study that
ppar-g acts as a potential mediator of vascular disease [30]. in our model of adipocytes differentiated
in vitro, ppar-g expression is already up-regulated.
under these conditions, ppar-g mrna expression
is only moderately modulated by troglitazone and
there is no other evidence that even addition of troglitazone for 72 h significantly affects the differentiation state (m. birgel, personal communicationn).
recent studies on the depot-related expression of
ppar-g showed a lower expression in visceral adipose tissue in lean and moderately overweight sub-

382

jects, whereas in obese patients, ppar-g mrna expression was similar in the two depots [31]. this possible weight-dependent difference in ppar-g-expression is not reflected by a difference in the potential of troglitazone to suppress pai-1 production according to our results. in another study, a consistent
depot-specific difference in ppar-g mrna expression between isolated human subcutaneous and
omental adipocytes could be not shown [32].
the results of our study show that troglitazone reduces pai-1 production in cultured human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional level. this observation could help to explain the beneficial effect
of troglitazone on plasma pai-1 concentrations reported in clinical studies. this observation could be
another mechanism, by which troglitazone can reduce the increased cardiovascular risk of patients
with the insulin-resistance syndrome.
