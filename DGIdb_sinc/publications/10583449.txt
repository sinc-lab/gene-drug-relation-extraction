abstract

background in essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular resistance (rvr) may be a
marker of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-mediated impairment of renal sodium
excretion. this hypothesis was tested by investigating whether, in subjects with essential
hypertension, the natriuretic response to specific renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(raas) blockade by renin-inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx  could be predicted from pretreatment
renal vascular tone.
materials and methods renal hemodynamics, and the effects of single (n ¼ 17) and
multiple doses (n ¼ 8, 8 days) of  xxxd3095xxx  (600 mg day¹1) on sodium excretion were
studied under conditions of carefully controlled sodium balance.
results pretreatment renal vascular tone showed considerable individual differences:
filtration fraction (ff) ranged from 21·2 to 30·3% and rvr from 18·8 to 33·5
10¹2 mmhg min ml¹1 in the single dose study, and ff from 20·8 to 24·9% and rvr
from 14·8 to 28·8 10¹2 mmhg min ml¹1 in the multiple dose study.  xxxd3095xxx  induced a
fall in blood pressure, ff and rvr, with considerable interindividual variability in
natriuretic response. during single dose, cumulative sodium loss was 5·1 mmol per 5 h
(¹8·8 to þ24·6), whereas after 8 days treatment cumulative sodium loss was 72 6 30 mmol
(¹46 to þ187). the natriuretic response to  xxxd3095xxx  during single as well as multiple dose
significantly correlated with pretreatment renal vascular tone (estimated from ff and rvr)
but not with  xxxd3095xxx -induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in hormonal parameters.
cumulative sodium loss was largest in patients with a higher pretreatment ff and rvr
(r ¼ 0·74, p < 0·001 and r ¼ 0·52, p < 0·05, respectively, single dose; and r ¼ 0·75, p < 0·05
and r ¼ 0·73, p < 0·05, respectively, multiple dose).
conclusion these data support the hypothesis that in essential hypertension an elevated
renal vascular tone is a marker of raas-mediated impairment of sodium excretion.

essential hypertension is characterized by abnormalities in
renal hemodynamics and sodium handling, which are
assumed to play a role in its pathophysiology [1–3]. effective renal plasma flow (erpf) is reduced in many patients,
with a preserved glomerular filtration rate (gfr), resulting
in elevated renal vascular resistance (rvr) and an elevated
filtration fraction (ff) [4,5]. the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (raas) is implicated in the elevated
rvr in essential hypertension [6–8]. as an elevated rvr
is also found in patients with low levels of circulating
raas parameters, it has been hypothesized that intrarenal
raas activity is involved. intrarenal raas activity cannot

be measured directly in man, therefore the evidence supporting this assumption is mainly derived from the renal
hemodynamic responses to raas-blockade and to  xxxg99xxx  (angii), respectively. an enhanced renal vasodilator response to ace inhibition was found in a subset of
essential hypertensives in whom the renal vasoconstrictor
response to angii infusion was blunted [9]. these data are
consistent with an elevated intrarenal angii in these subjects, as manifest from an inappropriately elevated renal
vascular tone. these abnormalities could well be involved
in the impairment of renal sodium excretion in essential
hypertension [9,10].
from the above data it can be hypothesized that in
essential hypertension an elevated rvr is a marker of
raas-mediated impairment of renal sodium excretion. if
so, one would expect that blockade of the raas induces
natriuresis in proportion to pretreatment renal vascular tone.
to test this hypothesis we measured renal hemodynamics
and the effects of specific raas-blockade by renin-inhibitor
 xxxd3095xxx  on sodium excretion in essential hypertensives,
both for the acute effects on sodium excretion and the
eventual effect on sodium balance during multiple dosing.

methods
patients and protocols
two separate sets of experiments were performed: on the
acute natriuretic response and on the eventual effects on
sodium balance during multiple dosing, respectively.
seventeen subjects were included in the single dose study
and eight subjects in the multiple dose study, four of whom
had also participated in the single dose study. patient
characteristics at entry are presented in table 1; all had
mild to moderate essential hypertension without clinically
relevant end-organ damage. sitting diastolic blood pressure
was between 95 and 115 mmhg. excluded were patients
with secondary hypertension, patients overweight by more
than 120% of their ideal body weight (metropolitan life
insurance table), and patients with a history of alcohol or
drug abuse. women of childbearing potential or taking
birth control pills were also excluded. all subjects gave
informed consent and the study was approved by the

local ethical committee. in both studies antihypertensive
medication was withdrawn at least 3 weeks before entry.

single dose study
all subjects adhered to a moderately sodium restricted diet
(50 mmol 24 h¹1) for at least 2 weeks. they visited the
outpatient clinic once weekly. only if sodium excretion
stabilized below 70 mmol 24 h¹1 on two consecutive occasions were they included in the study. this single dose
study had a double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over
design. subjects were studied on two different days, separated by a 3 day wash-out. they were randomized to receive
either an oral dose of 600 mg  xxxd3095xxx  or placebo on the
first or second study day. after an overnight fast all subjects
were in hospital in a supine position during the study day
except when voiding. from 08.00 to 18.00 h blood pressure
was recorded, and renal hemodynamics as well as urinary
excretion of sodium and creatinine were measured. the
run-in period lasted from 08.00 until 11.00 h. from 11.00
until 13.00 h baseline data were obtained. after  xxxd3095xxx 
or placebo at 13.00 h, effects were monitored for 5 h. urine
was collected at hourly intervals. during the study day a
constant infusion of 150 ml glucose 5% per hour was
administered in a forearm vein, in order to maintain
adequate diuresis and meals (every second hour in identical
portions) and drinks (150 ml each hour) were supplied.
this added to a total amount of 3000 ml fluids, 50 mmol
sodium and 100 mmol potassium over the study day. blood
was drawn at 13.00, 14.00, 15.00, 16.00 and 18.00 h for
determination of immunoreactive renin (irr) and hourly
from 11.00 until 18.00 h for measurement of renal hemodynamics.

multiple dose study
all patients were hospitalized for 18 days. patients were
ambulant during the study, except during the times of
measurements, with fixed times for activities, meals, and
rest. they adhered to a diet containing 50 mmol sodium,
100 mmol potassium, 60 g of proteins and 2500 ml fluids
per day. the 24 h urine was collected daily to measure
urinary creatinine, sodium and potassium. blood pressure

was measured daily between 11.00 and 12.00 h in the
supine position. after a run-in period of 5 days the patients
were studied for a 5 day period without treatment, to
ascertain steady state sodium balance by stable urinary
sodium excretion and stable body weight. this was followed by 8 days treatment with  xxxd3095xxx , 600 mg p.o.
administered at noon. renal hemodynamics were assessed
in the pretreatment phase at day eight, and on the fifth day
of renin inhibition. blood was drawn for determination of
plasma irr, plasma renin activity (pra), immunoreactive
angii and plasma aldosterone concentration at noon, when
patients had been supine for 1 h.

gfr and erpf were measured by constant infusion
of 125i-iothalamate and 131i-hippuran, respectively, and
corrected for standard body surface area (1·73 m2). the
day-to-day coefficient of variation of this method is 2·2%
and 5%, respectively [13]. for the single dose study seven
1-h clearances of both tracers were measured, for the
multiple dose study two consecutive 2-h clearances were
measured. ff is calculated as gfr/erpf and expressed as
a percentage. rvr is calculated as the ratio of mean arterial
pressure and erpf. in healthy volunteers, during a similar
study performed in our hospital, rvr was 18·1 6 0·7
10¹2 mmhg min ml¹1 (range 14–21·1).

methods

data analysis

blood pressure was recorded by an automatic noninvasive
device (dinamap, criticon inc, tampa, florida, usa).
this was done  xxxd1891xxx  min intervals during both single dose
study days. during the multiple dose study, blood pressure
was measured daily during 1 h at 5 min intervals. furthermore, during renal function days and on both the first and
last day of treatment, blood pressure was measured from
10.00 until 18.00 h every 10 min. map was calculated as
diastolic blood pressure plus one third of the pulse pressure. for each hour the mean of six measurements was
calculated.
urinary sodium, potassium and creatinine were measured by a standard autoanalyzer technique (sma-c,
technicon, tarrytown, ny, usa). blood samples for
measurement of irr, pra and pac were collected into
vacutainer tubes containing edta as an anticogulant; at
room temperature for irr and prechilled for pra and pac,
respectively. after immediate separation plasma was stored
at ¹20 8c until analysis. the irr was determined using
the renin irma pasteur kit, with a coefficient of variation
of 15·9% (interassay) and 6·6% (intra-assay), both at
31 pg ml¹1, and a detection limit of 1·5 pg ml¹1 [11].
pra was assessed by the quantitation of generated angi as
measured by radioimmunoassay (rianen angi ria kit)
[12]. the detection limit is 0·2 ng l h¹1. pac was measured
by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay (coat-a-count aldosterone, dpc, los angeles, ca). the coefficients of variation are 3·1% (intra-assay, mean value 227 pg ml¹1) and
3·6% (interassay, mean value 454 pg ml¹1). the lower
detection limit is 16 pg ml¹1. blood samples for the measurement of angii were collected into prechilled vacutainer
tubes containing an inhibitor cocktail consisting of edta,
the ace-inhibitor cilazaprilat, and the renin-inhibitor ro
42–5892, in order to prevent the formation of angii during
further analysis. after immediate separation plasma was
stored at ¹20 8c until analysis. angii was measured by the
nichols institute diagnostics angii ria with a coefficient
of variation of 5·3% (interassay, mean value 19 pg ml¹1)
and 4·4% (intra-assay, mean value 22 pg ml¹1). during
analysis, plasma was first separated from plasma proteins
by ethanol extraction. the extracted plasma angii was
measured in a sensitive and specific competitive proteinbinding radioimmunoassay (detection limit 3·6 pg ml¹1).

results are expressed as mean 6 sem. ranges are given
when appropriate. the effect of single dose  xxxd3095xxx  is
expressed as the mean of the individual maximal 1-h effect
during the 5-h post  xxxd3095xxx  for all parameters after
calculation of the mean hourly values. for each subject
the hour of maximum response was compared to the
corresponding hour during placebo. cumulated sodium
loss was calculated as the sum of the differences between
urinary sodium excretion during each of the 5 h post dose
and the mean of the last two pretreatment hours. the
resulting value was compared to the corresponding value
during placebo.
during the multiple dose study cumulated sodium loss
was calculated as follows. first, for each of the five pretreatment and eight treatment days, baseline steady state
sodium excretion (the mean of the last two pretreatment
days) was subtracted from the actual natriuresis. next, we
calculated the surplus sodium loss (or retention) during
treatment.
statistical analysis was performed by paired, nonparametric anova (friedman) for repeated measurements
followed by dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons,
and by the paired wilcoxon’s signed rank test. to evaluate
relationships between variables, pearson’s correlation
coefficients were calculated. p-values of less than 0·05
(two-sided) were considered statistically significant.

results
single dose
all patients adhered well to the diet, as reflected by urinary
sodium excretion prior to the study days (45 6 4 and
47 6 5 mmol 24 h¹1, respectively). no change in natriuresis was observed during placebo (4·6 6 0·6 to 4·6 6
0·6 mmol h¹1) whereas a nonsignificant increase was
observed in response to  xxxd3095xxx  (4 6 0·5 to 5·1 6
0·8 mmol h¹1, mean of 5 h; ns vs. placebo). cumulated
sodium loss was 5·1 6 2·2 mmol (as compared to placebo)
with a range from ¹8·8 to þ24·6 mmol, indicating sodium
retention in some patients and natriuresis in others.

the effects of  xxxd3095xxx  on blood pressure, sodium

decrease from 108 6 3 to 96 6 2 mmhg (11·4%, p < 0·05)
on the fifth day of treatment. sodium excretion increased
from a baseline of 40 6 3 to 54 6 8 mmol 24 h¹1 on the
third day of treatment (p < 0·05) with a return to 45 6
7 mmol 24 h¹1 towards the end of the study. cumulative
sodium loss was 72 6 30 mmol (ns) in 8 days. urinary
excretion of potassium fell from 90 6 3 to 75 6 4 mmol
24 h¹1 (p < 0·05), corresponding with a cumulative potassium retention of 42 6 11 mmol (p < 0·05). the interindividual variation was considerable, ranging from ¹46 to

90 mmol for cumulative potassium retention, respectively.
cumulative urinary fluid loss was 715 6 397 ml (range
¹1171 to 2752) corresponding to a decrease in body
weight of 0·9 6 0·1 kg (p < 0·05). the 24-h urinary creatinine excretion remained stable. cumulative sodium loss

the effects of  xxxd3095xxx  on renal hemodynamics and

gfr was unchanged whereas erpf increased. accordingly, ff and rvr fell significantly. pra, plasma angii
and aldosterone decreased significantly, whereas plasma
irr increased.
individual differences in cumulative sodium loss were
predicted by pretreatment renal vascular tone, with the
highest cumulative sodium loss in patients with the highest
pretreatment ff (r ¼ 0·75, p < 0·05) and rvr (r ¼ 0·73,
p < 0·05, fig. 3). in addition, pretreatment angii (r ¼ 0·85,
p < 0·01) correlated with the  xxxd3095xxx -induced sodium
loss. pretreatment rvr was highest in patients with the
highest pretreatment angii (r ¼ 0·84, p < 0·01), whereas
for ff this correlation was of borderline significance
(r ¼ 0·63, p < 0·1). neither pretreatment pra, irr, aldosterone nor their treatment-induced changes correlated with
cumulative sodium loss or with renal hemodynamics. the
 xxxd3095xxx -induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in
blood pressure did not correlate with cumulative sodium
loss during  xxxd3095xxx .

discussion
this study shows that specific blockade of the raas by
single and by multiple dose  xxxd3095xxx  reduces blood pressure and rvr. the effect on sodium excretion displayed
considerable interindividual variability. the pretreatment
indices of renal vascular tone, i.e. rvr and ff, consistently
correlated with natriuresis during  xxxd3095xxx , with a greater
acute natriuresis and a greater effect on eventual sodium
balance in patients with a higher pretreatment renal
vascular tone. our findings are the first to demonstrate
such a relationship. these data support the hypothesis
that in essential hypertension a high rvr is a marker of
raas-mediated impairment of renal sodium excretion.
as anticipated, the natriuretic response to  xxxd3095xxx 
varied considerably between individuals, for the acute effects

resistance (rvr, 10¹2 mmhg min ml¹1; right panel).

on sodium excretion as well as for the eventual effects on
sodium balance. we scrupulously monitored sodium intake
and urine collection. prior to treatment all patients were
in sodium balance, as indicated by the stable natriuresis
prior to treatment. accuracy of urine collection is apparent
from the stable creatinine excretion. furthermore, cumulative sodium loss in the multiple dose study corresponded
with the fall in body weight. thus, the individual differences in natriuresis are likely to reflect real differences in
responsiveness to raas blockade rather than confounding
factors.
most previous data on the role of the raas in the
renal abnormalities in essential hypertension were obtained
by studies applying ace-inhibition [3]. thus nonspecific
effects of ace-inhibition such as bradykinin breakdown
may have affected study outcomes. the present data
obtained by renin-inhibition provide more specific evidence for causal involvement of the raas. renininhibitors have been criticized for their poor bioavailability.
in the present study, however, the effects on hormonal
parameters as well as blood pressure, renal hemodynamics
and sodium excretion indicate a clear-cut pharmacological
action of  xxxd3095xxx . moreover, in a similar setting we have
documented adequate plasma levels of  xxxd3095xxx  [14].
what insights could our data provide on the role of the
raas in the renal abnormalities in essential hypertension?
first, an increased rvr and ff might simply reflect
greater raas-activity with, consequently, a more pronounced effect of raas blockade at all parameters. this

would be supported by the correlation between pretreatment angii and rvr in the multiple dose study, and by the
predictive value of angii for the  xxxd3095xxx -induced natriuresis in this study. yet, for this explanation to be valid, one
would also have expected a correlation between pretreatment pra and irr and the subsequent renal responses to
renin inhibition, and a correlation between the remikireninduced changes in hormonal parameters and natriuresis.
such correlations, however, were absent in both studies.
thus, interindividual differences in natriuresis cannot
simply be explained by different responses of circulating
raas parameters. in this respect, however, possible confounding effects of methodological factors in the assessment of raas-components should be considered. the
sustained decrease of pra during  xxxd3095xxx  suggests adequate suppression of circulating raas activity, but pra
may not be a reliable indicator of raas activity during
renin inhibition [15]. pra and angii did not fall in a
parallel fashion in our study, which is in accordance with
other studies with renin inhibitors [16]. this could be
because of differences in individual ace-activity, alternative angii forming pathways or as a result of methodological factors in the assay. we should note in this respect
that we measured immunoreactive—and not biologically
active—angii, which could have overestimated true
circulating angii levels because of cross-reactivity.
second, would the above explanation be valid, one
would also expect more pronounced renal vasodilation
during  xxxd3095xxx  in patients with high pretreatment rvr

rvr predicts natriuresis by  xxxd3095xxx 

and ff. such a relationship, however, was absent in the
present study. it can be argued that in the multiple dose
study cumulative sodium loss represented a continuous
measurement, whereas renal hemodynamics were measured at a single time point, which could obscure a relationship between these two parameters. in the single dose
study, however, renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion
were measured simultaneously, suggesting that disparacies
in time course between renal hemodynamic effects and
natriuresis cannot explain the absence of a correlation
between these two parameters. we should note, however,
that our assessment of erpf does not allow the assessment
of differences in renal blood flow distribution. intrarenal
infusion of angii at a dose that did not alter whole-kidney
renal blood flow, for instance, has been shown to markedly
reduce medullary blood flow and sodium excretion [17].
we cannot exclude, therefore, the possibility that in
patients with a higher pretreatment renal vascular tone,
 xxxd3095xxx  induced a relatively greater increase in medullary
blood flow, and consequently a greater impact on sodium
excretion in these patients.
despite these restrictions being taken in mind the consistent predictive value of the pretreatment parameters of
renal vascular tone for natriuresis during  xxxd3095xxx  stands
out as the main finding of our study. the concordance of
these correlations for single and for multiple dosing
enhances the robustness of this finding. the multiple
dose data, moreover, demonstrate that the predictive
value holds true not only for the acute pharmacological
effects, but also for the final effect on sodium balance. as
the latter reflects the net effect of pharmacological intervention and counter-regulatory homeostatic responses, it
may provide a better indicator of the pathophysiological
significance of the observations.
what could this pathophysiological significance be? in
our opinion our findings could imply that pretreatment
rvr and ff reflect inappropriate intrarenal raas activity
with concomitant effects on sodium status that are
unmasked by specific raas blockade. several reports
showed that renal vascular tone in essential hypertensives
does not correlate with circulating raas parameters. on
the other hand, there is consistent evidence supporting the
association of elevated rvr with inappropriate intrarenal
raas activity in a subset of essential hypertensive patients,
denoted as nonmodulators [18–23]. whereas in the present
study we did not attempt to delineate specific subgroups,
our data are certainly consistent with the assumption of
inappropriate renal raas activity in some, but not all
essential hypertensive patients. in accord with this assumption we previously found that, during high sodium intake,
renin inhibition increased renal plasma flow only in hypertensive patients in whom high sodium intake had failed to
increase renal plasma flow [24].
to link these abnormalities to the pathogenesis of high
blood pressure, it was suggested that they lead to impairment of renal sodium excretion that results in higher blood
pressure, in particular during the challenge of a high
sodium intake [25–28]. so far, however, no data were
available on a specific response pattern of sodium excretion

to raas-blockade in relation to pre-existent renal vascular
tone, and our present findings are the first to establish such
a relationship. moreover, our data support the impact of
abnormal renal hemodynamics and inappropriate intrarenal raas regulation on renal sodium handling, even
during a moderately restricted sodium intake.
in conclusion, our data show that pretreatment renal
hemodynamics consistently predict the individual natriuretic response to raas-blockade. these data support the
hypothesis that inappropriate renal raas activity is
involved in the impaired renal sodium handling in a
subset of essential hypertensive patients.
