indirect immunofluorescence studies on the steroid-producing activity of hamster ova.  steroidogenesis in the unfertilized hamster ova was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence study. delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (delta 5-3 beta-hsd) activity was found in hamster follicular and ovulatory ova with pregnenolone used as the substrate. a significant quantity of  xxxd2037xxx  was detected in the ooplasm of follicular and ovulatory ova. no progesterone was found. the activity of delta 5-3 beta-hsd in follicular and ovulatory ova was inhibited by preincubation with 10 iu of human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg) in 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution.  xxxd3436xxx , a potent new inhibitor of the delta 5-3 beta-hsd system, was found to inhibit the activity of delta 5-3 beta-hsd in ovulatory ova in 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution at a concentration of 10(-7)m. after these results were obtained, steroidogenesis of hamster ova was suggested in an indirect immunofluorescence study, and the implications of steroidogenesis for oocyte maturation and subsequent fertilization are discussed.
