abstract aims/hypothesis: recombinant dna technology is a useful tool that can be used to create insulin
analogues with modified absorption kinetics to improve
glycaemic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. among conventional insulin analogues, which are
usually created by amino acid exchange,  xxxd2361xxx  is
the first analogue to be acylated with a fatty acid to enable
reversible albumin binding. in this study we determined
activation of the  xxxg1194xxx  (ir)-signalling cascade
by  xxxd2361xxx  at the level of ir and ir substrate (irs)
phosphorylation, as well as downstream signalling elements such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and akt,
and performed epidural eeg in vivo. methods: c57bl/6
mice were injected i.v. with either  xxxd2361xxx  or
 xxxd2364xxx  and western blot analysis was performed
on liver, muscle, hypothalamic and cerebrocortical tissues.
moreover, cerebrocortical activity was detected by eeg in
awake mice and cerebral insulin concentrations were
measured following  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx 
injection. results: the time course and extent of ir
phosphorylation in peripheral tissues were similar following  xxxd2361xxx  treatment compared with human
insulin, but insulin signalling in hypothalamic and
cerebrocortical tissue determined by tyrosine-phosphorylation of the ir and  xxxg1199xxx  proteins occurred faster and was
enhanced due to a higher  xxxd2361xxx  concentration in

introduction
the treatment strategies for patients with type 1 and type 2
diabetes have been continually improved over the past
decades. one milestone towards optimised glycaemic
control are rapid and long-acting insulin analogues that
more closely mimic the physiological insulin response to a
meal following injection [1, 2] and achieve sufficient basal
day-long glycaemic control [3]. the characteristics are
based on the fact that modification of the amino acid
sequence of the insulin molecule results in distinguished
hexamer formation and therefore altered absorption kinetics. among conventional insulin analogues that are usually
created by amino acid exchange,  xxxd2361xxx  is the first
analogue that is acylated with a fatty acid to enable
reversible albumin binding [4–7]. albumin binding is a
common principle to delay absorption and results in
retention of the insulin molecule in the s.c. depot for a
longer period of time [8]. due to the profile of action of
 xxxd2361xxx  and the fact that the albumin-bound insulin
buffers against rapid changes of absorption,  xxxd2361xxx 
action is supposed to be more predictable in terms of the
risk for hypoglycaemic episodes compared with other basal
insulins [9–11].

1275

the initiation of insulin therapy in type 1 and type 2
diabetes is usually associated with weight gain [12, 13].
indeed, there is a positive correlation between improved
glycaemic control and weight gain, which is clearly
undesirable as obesity is present in most patients with
type 2 diabetes.
over the past years data have accumulated supporting
the fact that insulin therapy using  xxxd2361xxx  leads to
both improved glycaemic control and weight stability [14],
opening new perspectives for insulin therapy. however, the
mechanism(s) underlying the altered weight gain with
 xxxd2361xxx  are unknown.
at the molecular level, insulin binds to its cell surface
receptor and stimulates autophosphorylation of the betasubunit, followed by phosphorylation of substrates,
including the  xxxg1194xxx  substrate (irs) protein family
members and activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase) [15]. in peripheral tissue,
activation of this pathway is involved in processes like
glucose transport, suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis,
protein synthesis and gene transcription [7, 16]. however,
in the brain, intact insulin signalling via the irs-pi 3-kinase
pathway is essential for nutrient homeostasis and appetite
regulation as pharmacological inhibition of insulin signalling, especially in the hypothalamus, leads to obesityinduced diabetes [17, 18]. keeping in mind that insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  therapy is characterised by weight stability or even
weight loss, we reasoned that the kinetics of insulin
signalling in the brain might be altered by  xxxd2361xxx .
in this study we tested this hypothesis and provide in
vivo data on the impact of  xxxd2361xxx  on the insulinsignalling cascade in peripheral and brain tissues. c57bl/6
mice were injected with either  xxxd2364xxx  or the
analogue and ir phosphorylation and activation of downstream signalling elements were analysed in muscle and
liver and hypothalamic and cerebrocortical tissues. the
data suggest that during regular activation of the insulinsignalling cascade in the periphery,  xxxd2361xxx  displays
a predominant activation of the cerebral insulin-signalling
cascade.

materials and methods
animals ten-week-old male c57bl/6 mice were obtained
from charles river wiga gmbh (sulzfeld, germany)
and studied after 2 weeks of acclimatisation. all
procedures were conducted according to the guidelines
of laboratory animal care and were approved by the local
governmental commission for animal research. mice were
kept on a normal light/darkness cycle and on a regular
chow. glucose levels were sampled from tail bleeds of
ketamine-anaesthetised mice using a glucometer elite
(bayer, elkhart, in, usa).
in vivo insulin stimulation and western blot analysis for in
vivo stimulation, a bolus of either 1 u/kg body weight of
 xxxd2364xxx  (0.6 mmol/l, 100 u/ml) or 2 u/kg body
weight of  xxxd2361xxx  (2.4 mmol/l, 100 u/ml) diluted

in phosphate buffer was injected into the inferior vena
cava of ketamine-anaesthetised mice after an overnight
fast. this dose was used to achieve comparable peripheral
insulin-signalling kinetics and glucose-lowering effects.
tissues (liver, muscle, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex)
were removed at the indicated time points and homogenised at 4°c as described [19]. homogenates were
allowed to solubilise for 30 min on ice and then clarified
by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 20 min. for detection of
insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, supernatants
were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against
the carboxy terminus of the ir (kkngriltlprsnps; a
gift from r. lammers, university of tübingen, germany)
and  xxxg1199xxx  (no. 06-506; upstate, charlottesville, va, usa).
visualisation of immunocomplexes after gel electrophoresis and western blotting with anti- xxxd1075xxx 
(p-tyr) antibody (py20; santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca, usa), anti-phospho-akt (ser473) and
anti-akt (upstate) was performed with a non-radioactively
enhanced chemiluminescence system.
assay of pi 3-kinase activity the same amount of total
protein from tissue lysates was immunopurified with antip-tyr antibody and immunocomplexes were absorbed by
protein a-sepharose for 12 h. immunoprecipitates were
washed three times and pellets were directly incubated
with 0.1 mg/ml l-alpha-phosphatidylinositol (sigma, munich,
germany) and 50 mumol/l [gamma32p]atp (perkin elmer life
science, zaventem, belgium) at room temperature for
10 min. after addition of 150 mul 1 mol/l hcl, lipids were
extracted twice with 450 mul chloroform/methanol (1:1 by
volume). products were separated by thin layer chromatography as described [20]. 32p-labelled phospholipids
were detected by autoradiography.
insulin extracts of total brain mice were stimulated i.v.
with either  xxxd2364xxx  (1 u/kg mouse) or insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  (2 u/kg mouse). at the indicated time points, total
brain was homogenised in 1.0 ml acid-ethanol and insulin
was extracted overnight at −20°c. the following day,
samples were centrifuged and insulin concentration was
measured in the supernatant with a competitive ria kit
(linco research, st charles, mo, usa) using a human
insulin and  xxxd2361xxx  standard curve. the data
presented for  xxxd2361xxx  are divided by eight to
normalise for the injected dose.
electroencephalography telemetric eeg analysis was
performed using implantable radio transmitters (physiotel
transmitter ta10ea-f20; data sciences international
[dsi], lexington, ma, usa). all surgical procedures
were conducted with the mouse under isoflurane (5%
induction, 1.5% maintenance) anaesthesia. the mouse was
placed in a stereotaxic head holder fitted with a mouse
incisor bar. midline skin incisions (10 mm on the head and
15 mm down the neck) were made and the s.c. tissue was
bluntly separated. the body of the telemetry transmitter
was implanted s.c. in a pouch made in the loose skin of the
back and neck. the two lead wires were tunnelled s.c.

1276

through the incision on the scull. holes (0.7 mm diameter)
were drilled in the cranium to implant two screws, around
which the tips of the eeg leads were wrapped. for the
recording electrode, the screws were placed epidurally
1 mm anterior to the lambda and 1 mm left of the sutura
saggitalis, and for the reference electrode they were placed
1 mm anterior to the bregma and 1 mm right to the sutura
coronaria. the electrodes and screws were then covered
with dental acrylic cement, and the scalp sutured closely
around the resulting wound with non-absorbable 5–0
suture material (ethilon polyamide; ethicon, germany).
proper screw placement was confirmed histologically post
mortem. the mice were given 1 week of post-surgical
recovery before undergoing eeg recordings for further
analysis. for in vivo stimulation,  xxxd2364xxx  (1 u/kg
body weight) or  xxxd2361xxx  (2 u/kg body weight) was
administered i.v. in the tail vein of awake, overnight-fasted
mice in a cross-over design 5 days apart. after the
injection, the mice were placed separately in their
transparent home cages and an eeg was immediately
recorded, lasting 30 min. basal eeg data represent 1 h
measurement in fed mice between 09.00 and 10.00 h when
insulin was usually applied. telemetry signals (eeg and
motor activity) were processed by a data-sciences analog
converter (data exchange matrix; dsi) and stored
digitally using the dataquest a.r.t. 3.1 software (dsi).
eeg activity was sampled at 250 hz with a filter cut-off of
40 hz. a video monitoring system was used in order to
record referential eegs and simultaneous video images
showing the behaviour of the mice.

spectral analysis were calculated. power spectral estimates
provided the basic frequency characteristics of each
recorded region. consecutive 2-s epochs were subjected
to a fast fourier transform routine (hanning smoothing
window, each epoch divided into three 256-point overlapping segment windows with 50% overlap). epochs of
2 s are to be preferred in intraoperative monitoring because
they allow more rapid detection of change by increasing
the statistical reliability of the power spectral estimate
[21]. eeg power density (the square of the amplitude) was
computed for a frequency range of 0.5–100 hz (delta: 0.5–
4 hz, theta: 4–8 hz, alpha: 8–12 hz, beta: 12–30 hz, and
gamma: 30–100 hz). the value of the eeg power density
in each one of the different frequency bands was then
examined and compared.
statistical analysis statistical analyses for western blot
analysis were done by a two-sided unpaired student’s ttest. data in figures are expressed as means±sem. the

with  xxxd2361xxx  to determine whether the insulin
analogue  xxxd2361xxx  activates the insulin-signalling
cascade to the same extent as  xxxd2364xxx , we injected
either  xxxd2364xxx  or  xxxd2361xxx  into 12-week-old
mice. insulin administration in this study was performed
by injection into the inferior vena cava to avoid the effect
of altered s.c. absorption kinetics and to focus on direct

were injected with either  xxxd2364xxx  or  xxxd2361xxx  into the
inferior vena cava. tissues were harvested after 2, 5, 10, 15 and
30 min and tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting in ir immunoprecipitates from muscle tissue. to ensure

ir-signalling characteristics. throughout the 30-min experiment, glucose levels significantly dropped from 9.7±
0.3 to 3.5±0.2 mmol/l for  xxxd2364xxx  and to 4±
0.6 mmol/l for  xxxd2361xxx  (p<0.01, n=7).
following insulin injection, muscle tissue was dissected
after 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min and western blot analysis was
performed in order to determine the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ir. an intense phosphorylation was observed
after 2 min and preserved for 30 min (fig. 1). both
insulins displayed comparable kinetics with no significant
difference being observed between the two insulins (all
p>0.1). at the level of pi 3-kinase (fig. 2a) and phosphoakt (fig. 2b),  xxxd2361xxx  showed results comparable
with  xxxd2364xxx , which suggests an equal activation of
the ir-signalling cascade in muscle tissue (all p>0.1).
autophosphorylation of the ir and downstream elements
in liver tissue after stimulation with  xxxd2361xxx  to test
whether ir activation in liver is altered, we further injected
mice with either  xxxd2364xxx  or  xxxd2361xxx  and
determined ir phosphorylation states in liver tissue. ir
tyrosine phosphorylation could be clearly detected in
mice stimulated with  xxxd2364xxx  as well as in mice
stimulated with  xxxd2361xxx  as early as 2 min after
injection, and statistical analysis revealed no significant
difference between the two insulins (fig. 3, all p>0.1).
moreover, insulin stimulates the activation of pi 3-kinase
(fig. 4a) and phospho-akt (fig. 4b) in liver, and the extent
and time course were similar for both insulins over the 30min period (all p>0.1), suggesting that peripheral insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  receptor-signalling kinetics in vivo are not altered
due to the attachment of the fatty acid chain.

phosphorylation of the ir and  xxxg1199xxx  in hypothalamic tissue
after stimulation with  xxxd2361xxx  recent studies
revealed that dysregulation of ir signalling in the brain
is associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.
since ir and  xxxg1199xxx  are expressed in the hypothalamus, we
evaluated the ir-signalling characteristics in vivo after
insulin injection.
the mice were stimulated with insulin and hypothalamic tissue was harvested after 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min.
phosphorylation of the ir was detected by western blot
analysis using anti-p-tyr antibody. concurrent immunoblots revealed an earlier and more pronounced ir phosphorylation for  xxxd2361xxx  as compared with human
insulin (fig. 5a), favouring the idea that  xxxd2361xxx 
acts faster and more strongly in the brain.
 xxxg1199xxx  is essential for intact insulin signalling in the brain,
as partially dysregulated  xxxg1199xxx  signalling is responsible for
hyperphagia and obesity [17]. therefore, we determined
the tyrosine phosphorylation state of  xxxg1199xxx  in the hypothalamus of mice. after insulin injection, tissues were
removed after 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min, and western blot
analysis was performed. these data suggest that the
activation levels of  xxxg1199xxx  in mice treated with insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  are significantly elevated compared with human
insulin with a shift to an earlier activation of the insulinsignalling cascade for  xxxd2361xxx  (fig. 5b).
phosphorylation of the ir in cortical tissue, eeg and total
brain insulin concentrations following  xxxd2361xxx 
treatment in addition to insulin signalling in hypothalamic
tissue we determined the impact of  xxxd2361xxx 
stimulation on tyrosine phosphorylation in cortical tissue.

membranes were blotted with anti-ir antibody (lower panel).

(solid bars) is given in the bar graph. scanning data obtained from

in agreement with the data obtained from the
hypothalamus, ir phosphorylation was more enhanced
by  xxxd2361xxx  than by  xxxd2364xxx  (fig. 6a). to
prove the fact that altered activation of the insulinsignalling cascade in cortical tissue is related to changes in
brain activity, eeg recordings were obtained in the basal
state and from mice that had been treated i.v. with either
 xxxd2364xxx  or  xxxd2361xxx  in a cross-over design 5
days apart.  xxxd2361xxx  induced activation in delta,

theta, alpha and beta eeg frequency activity (fig. 6b).
this suggests that as a consequence of improved cerebral
insulin signalling,  xxxd2361xxx  modulates electrical
activity in the mouse cortex.
to determine the impact of an altered transport across
the blood-brain barrier that might contribute to the brain
data obtained, we measured total insulin concentrations in
 xxxd102xxx acid brain extracts. following i.v. injection,
 xxxd2361xxx  reached significantly higher concentrations

we therefore conclude that treatment of mice with an

the cerebral insulin-signalling cascade while there is an
equal ir activation in the periphery.

characteristics, insulin was administrated by i.v. injection.
thereby, plasma concentrations immediately rose and a
comparable onset of action and tissue distribution was
achieved.
in our in vivo experiments,  xxxd2361xxx  activates the
insulin-signalling cascade in muscle and liver tissues to the
same extent as  xxxd2364xxx  does. however, in hypothalamic and cerebrocortical tissues, insulin-signalling kinetics determined by tyrosine-phosphorylation of the ir and
 xxxg1199xxx  proteins were enhanced and the maximum was shifted
to earlier time points, suggesting an altered profile of
 xxxd2361xxx  action in the cerebral nervous system.
as the time course and extent of activation of the insulinsignalling cascade in liver and muscle were comparable,
we believe that  xxxd2361xxx  action in the brain is
enhanced due to the attachment of the fatty acid chain. this
is reflected by elevated  xxxd2361xxx  concentrations in
the brain.
although several mechanisms are suggested by which
insulin may enter the brain from the blood, including

discussion
recombinant dna technology has been used for almost
two decades now to develop insulin analogues with
advanced kinetic profiles and distinguished absorption
[2]. recently, the analogue  xxxd2361xxx  was developed
by the attachment of a 14-carbon fatty acid chain to lysb29
resulting in delayed absorption kinetics.
here we report in vivo data from mice that were treated
with either  xxxd2364xxx  or the insulin analogue insulin
 xxxd2361xxx . in order to overcome the effect of altered s.c.
absorption kinetics and to focus on direct ir-signalling

receptor-mediated transport processes, conclusive data are
not available [22]. however, it is known that albumin
directly penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid across
choroids plexus epithelial cells [23], and there is evidence
that as lipophilicity and membrane permeability of a
molecule increases, the concentration in the cerebrospinal
fluid rises [24]. moreover, one could speculate that in the
presence of a low albumin concentration such as in the
cerebrospinal fluid, the rate of unbound  xxxd2361xxx  is
increased, and therefore an enhanced amount of ‘active’
 xxxd2361xxx  molecules is available to bind to the ir. in
addition, the impact of the fatty acid chain on ir binding in
the brain is unknown; however, it could indeed also count
towards enhanced ir signalling.
the observation of enhanced insulin signalling in the
brain using  xxxd2361xxx  is of particular interest in the
context of former studies in humans using intranasal
insulin, which enters the cerebrospinal fluid compartment
without affecting circulating insulin levels in the bloodstream. in these healthy subjects the administration of nasal
insulin led to a loss of body weight and body fat over an 8week treatment accompanied by a drop in plasma leptin
levels. these data provide a profound basis for a negative
feedback signal of insulin in the regulation of body weight
and adiposity [25]. moreover, a recent study in humans
compared the effect of  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx 
on hepatic glucose production [26]. while the glucose
infusion rate and glucose disposal were similar after s.c.
injection, hepatic glucose production within a 16-h

euglycaemic clamp was increased using  xxxd2361xxx .
these data are somehow contradictory to our in vivo data
on equal ir signalling in liver tissue; however, the altered
observation time (short-term vs long-term) and the route of
administration (s.c. vs i.v.) might be responsible for these
findings.
on a molecular basis, impressive data from mouse
models have accumulated over the past years suggesting
that dysregulation of insulin action at the level of the ir
and downstream signalling targets in the central nervous
system is associated with obesity and diabetes [27, 28]. the
precise underlying mechanisms are uncertain and difficult
to establish, but it is known that female mice lacking the ir
specifically in the brain display increased food intake, and
both male and female mice developed diet-sensitive
obesity with elevated body fat and plasma leptin levels
including mild insulin resistance. furthermore, experimental desensitisation of the cerebral ir resulted in both a
cognitive deficit and abnormalities in cerebral oxidative
glucose metabolism [29], supporting the idea that intact
insulin signalling in the brain is a pivotal element for brain
function and glucose homeostasis. at the irs level,  xxxg1199xxx  is
potentially important since a lack of  xxxg1199xxx  in the hypothalamus results in increased appetite and body mass, leading
to insulin resistance and finally diabetes [17]. moreover,
the loss of  xxxg1199xxx  in the mouse brain is associated with
reduced neuronal proliferation during development, as well
as accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing
phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, favouring intact

1281

 xxxg1199xxx  signalling in the hypothalamus as neuroprotective
[30]. this is in agreement with a study in humans showing
that intranasal administration of insulin leads to an
improvement of cognitive function and memory, opening
a whole new aspect in insulin therapy [25].
at the level of pi 3-kinase, it has been demonstrated that
the food-intake-lowering effect of insulin in mice is
reversed by intracerebroventricular infusion of pi 3-kinase
inhibitors [31], further supporting the idea that the irs-pi 3kinase pathway is a strong mediator of appetite and weight
control.
since the impact of an earlier and increased tyrosine
phosphorylation of the ir and  xxxg1199xxx  in hypothalamic tissue
observed during  xxxd2361xxx  treatment remains to be
further elucidated, it can be suggested that pronounced
activation of the insulin-signalling cascade in the brain is
sufficient to prevent hyperphagia and weight gain in insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  therapy. if this is the case, effects obtained in this
study might be related to the differences in weight
development observed in clinical trials comparing insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  with nph insulin treatment.
moreover, enhanced cortical eeg delta and theta activity represent the control of neuronal plasticity, and presumably learning and reprocessing of memories [32, 33].
taken together, the current in vivo data suggest that the
novel insulin analogue  xxxd2361xxx  is characterised by
an increased rate of brain action vs peripheral action. this
characteristic profile of  xxxd2361xxx  may provide a new
concept for insulin therapy in obese people with diabetes.
acknowledgements we wish to thank r. lammers for providing
