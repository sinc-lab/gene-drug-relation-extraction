proteins with reactive sulfhydryls are central to many
important metabolic reactions and also contribute to
a variety of signal transduction systems. in this report, we examine the mechanisms of oxidative damage to the two reactive sulfhydryls of  xxxg294xxx .  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2), peroxy radicals,
or hypochlorous acid (hocl) produced irreversibly
oxidized forms, primarily  xxxd519xxx  or cysteic acid, of  xxxg294xxx  if glutathione
(gsh) was not present. when gsh was approximately equimolar to protein thiols, irreversible oxidation
was prevented. h2o2 and  xxxd2298xxx  radicals both generated s-glutathiolated  xxxg294xxx  via partially oxidized protein sulfhydryl intermediates, while
hocl did not cause s-glutathiolation. thus, oxidative
damage from h2o2 or aaph was prevented by protein
s-glutathiolation, while a direct reaction between
gsh and oxidant likely prevents hocl-mediated protein damage. in cultured rat hepatocytes, carbonic
anhydrase iii was rapidly s-glutathiolated by  xxxd2563xxx . when hepatocyte glutathione was depleted,
 xxxd2563xxx  instead caused irreversible oxidation. we
hypothesized that normal depletion of glutathione in
aged animals might also lead to an increase in irreversible oxidation. indeed, both total protein extracts
and  xxxg294xxx  contained significantly
more  xxxd519xxx  in older rats compared to
young animals. these experiments show that, in the
absence of sufficient gsh, oxidation reactions lead to
irreversible protein sulfhydryl damage in purified proteins, cellular systems, and whole animals.

introduction
glutathione (gsh) is an essential component in the protection of cells from oxidants. it is thought to prevent oxidation of proteins by two major mechanisms. first, it
may function as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen
species (wefers and sies, 1983; winterbourn, 1993; winterbourn and metodiewa, 1994; pichorner et al., 1995).
this first function allows proteins to avoid modification
during oxidative events. second, it can form mixed disulfides with proteins, termed s-glutathiolation of proteins
(park and thomas, 1988; mallis et al., 2000). s-glutathiolation is a reversible oxidation of protein cysteine
residues that may prevent further oxidation (park and
thomas, 1988; lii et al., 1994, hamann et al., 2001). both
the oxidation of gsh to  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) and
the s-glutathiolation of proteins occur within seconds of
addition of oxidants to cell cultures and are among the
earliest measurable reactions to occur during an oxidative event (chai et al., 1994; lii et al., 1994; ravichandran
et al., 1994; schuppe-koistinen et al., 1994; dafré and
reischl, 1998). it is important to understand the relationship between direct scavenging and protein-mediated
scavenging of reactive oxygen species by gsh because
both mechanisms may affect the functioning of a wide
range of proteins in cells during oxidative events.
 xxxg294xxx  is a cytosolic protein that can
be used as a model to study s-glutathiolation. it has two
cysteine residues that are reactive to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (dtnb), alkylating agents, and oxidants (engberg et al., 1985; chai et al., 1991). it has been shown in
vitro to be s-glutathiolated by  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2),
diamide,  xxxd2811xxx  and the xanthine/ xxxg2431xxx 
h2o2/superoxide-generating system (chai et al., 1991; lii
et al., 1994; jung and thomas, 1996). when gsh is not
present to protect protein cysteines, oxidants will also
cause irreversible oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  in
vitro (lii et al., 1994; hamann et al., 2001; thomas and
mallis, 2001). irreversible oxidation is the formation of oxidized protein cysteine residues that are not reducible by
thiol-disulfide exchange. these products may be either
 xxxd519xxx  (cysteineso2h) or cysteine sulfonic
acid (cysteineso3h) (wefers and sies, 1983; miller and
claiborne, 1991; yeh et al., 1996; becker et al., 1999;
hamann et al., 2001). h2o2 has been shown to produce
 xxxd519xxx  in creatine kinase and both sulfinic
and sulfonic acid in  xxxg294xxx  (hamann
et al., 2001). cysteine sulfinic and sulfonic acid are present in a wide range of purified proteins and cysteine

sulfinic acid is found in total protein extracts of rat liver
(hamann et al., 2001), and so the formation of cysteine
sulfinic or sulfonic acid may be a general mechanism for
damage to proteins by oxidants.
differences in protein cysteine oxidation (reversible
and irreversible) which occur with changing gsh levels
may be responsible for redox regulation of cellular
processes (storz et al., 1990; sen and packer, 1996; cotgreave and gerdes, 1998), although the mechanism for
oxidant-mediated regulation of individual proteins is not
well-characterized on a molecular level. cellular glutathione can affect such diverse processes as transcription (storz et al., 1990; sen and packer, 1996), apoptosis
(cotgreave and gerdes, 1998), damage to dna (park
et al., 1998), cell division (park et al., 1998), proliferation of
cancer cells (terradez et al., 1993), susceptibility to diseases (terradez et al., 1993; herzenberg et al., 1997;
müller and gebel, 1998), and enzyme activity (thomas
et al., 1995b). gsh was presumed to regulate these
processes either by acting as an antioxidant, preventing
oxidation of critical cysteines (winterbourn and
metodiewa, 1999), or through formation of  xxxd2811xxx  and
subsequent s-thiolation of the proteins involved (dröge
et al., 1994). because  xxxd2811xxx  levels in cells rarely reach
levels necessary for s-glutathiolation, other mechanisms
are necessary to explain s-glutathiolation in vivo. in fact,
available evidence suggests that proteins are better scavengers of oxidants than low molecular weight thiols such
as gsh (mallis et al., 2001). there is no reason to suspect
that glutathione is a required intermediary between oxidant and protein; instead, it most likely functions to provide a free reactive thiol where steric factors prevent formation of a protein-protein disulfide. carbonic anhydrase
iii is in fact s-glutathiolated in hepatocytes without corresponding increases in  xxxd2811xxx  levels (chai et al., 1994).
when gsh is depleted from hepatocytes using the  xxxd1388xxx  synthase inhibitor  xxxd396xxx 
(bso), the radical generator  xxxd2563xxx  causes irreversible oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  (lii et al.,
1994). thus, at normal gsh concentrations, reduced and
s-glutathiolated forms of protein should predominate after oxidation. irreversibly oxidized proteins may predominate when gsh concentrations are low. for example, it
has been proposed that tyrosine phosphatase is reversibly regulated by s-glutathiolation, and that s-glutathiolation prevents permanent inactivation of this protein by reactive oxygen species (barrett et al., 1999a, b).
the effects of three different oxidants, h2o2, 2,2’azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (aaph), and
hypochlorous acid (hocl) on  xxxg294xxx  are
studied here. this study attempts to determine the role of
gsh concentration in the protection of protein cysteine
residues from irreversible oxidation. in particular it defines at what concentrations gsh reacts directly with
oxidants to prevent protein oxidation, and at what concentrations it participates in s-thiolation reactions. differences between three oxidants, h2o2, aaph, and hocl,
are explored in this context. experiments are also per-

formed in intact hepatocytes to demonstrate the validity
of the in vitro model system. evidence shows that proteins are good scavengers of oxidants relative to gsh,
and that a major role of gsh in protection of proteins is in
s-glutathiolation reactions. furthermore, irreversibly oxidized forms of  xxxg294xxx  are more abundant
in normal aged rat tissue as well as in oxidant treated hepatocytes when gsh is depleted.

results
gsh protects  xxxg294xxx  from
irreversible oxidation by h2o2
purified  xxxg294xxx  is modified specifically on
up to two cysteine residues following addition of 1-chloro2,4-dinitrobenzene (dtnb),  xxxd2811xxx , diamide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and xanthine/ xxxg2431xxx  (engberg
et al., 1985; chai et al., 1991; lii et al., 1994; jung and
thomas, 1996). it is modified in cells treated with diamide,
 xxxd2563xxx , and t-butyl hydroperoxide (lii et al., 1994;
jung and thomas, 1996).
h2o2 reacts readily with thiols to form sulfenic acid
which reacts readily with available thiols to form disulfides (figure 1). in the absence of available thiols, sulfenic
acid will continue to react with h2o2 to form sulfinic acid
and sulfonic acid (miller and claiborne, 1991; yeh et al.,
1996; hamann et al., 2001).  xxxg294xxx  reaction with oxidants was analyzed by isoelectric focusing
(ief). in ief gels, addition of negative charge to the protein by either s-glutathiolation or oxidation to sulfinic and
sulfonic acids, results in a more acidic protein band. reversible modifications are defined by the loss of the
acidic protein band on reduction with dtt. irreversible
modifications are resistant to dtt reduction. iam, nem
and dtt were equally effective for preventing any oxidation of  xxxg294xxx .
when  xxxg294xxx  was incubated with h2o2
for 15 minutes (figure 2a), acidic bands with pi’s of 7.2
and 6.8 appeared. these bands were mostly irreversible
to dtt reduction (indicated by the 5% change between
lanes 2 and 3), suggesting the cysteines were almost entirely irreversibly oxidized. when oxidized with h2o2 in
the presence of gsh (lanes 4 and 5), carbonic anhydrase
iii was modified to a greater extent and the acidic forms
were mostly sensitive to dtt. a minor amount of the reactive protein cysteine (~10%) remained insensitive to

fig. 1 the reaction mechanism of h2o2 with sulfhydryls.
h2o2 reacts directly with sulfhydryls to form sulfenic acid (winterbourn and metodiewa, 1999). sulfenic acid will then react
rapidly with free thiols to form a disulfide.

modification of  xxxg294xxx  was not reversible
by dtt (compare the right and left half of the gel). when
gsh was added to the reaction (figure 3b), the oxidative
modification was more pronounced and reversible (compare right and left half of each gel). figure 3c quantifies
the oxidatively modified  xxxg294xxx . as the
gsh concentration increased, reversible modification
(open symbols) increased and irreversible modification
(closed symbols) decreased. this indicates that reversible modification of  xxxg294xxx  is a facile
reaction in comparison to irreversible modification and is
favored when gsh is available.

fig. 2 gsh prevents irreversible oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  by h2o2.
(a)  xxxg294xxx  (30 µm) or s-glutathiolated carbonic
anhydrase iii was incubated with 2 mm h2o2 for 15 min at 37 °c
in 20 mm beta-glycerophosphate buffer ph 7.4.  xxxg294xxx  was treated with h2o2 in either the absence or presence
of 0.3 mm gsh. the reactions were stopped by treating the samples with 40 mm iam. a portion of each was reduced with 10 mm
dtt for 30 min at 37 °c before addition of iam. (b)  xxxg294xxx  was analyzed for irreversibly oxidized cysteine by
densitometry of ief gels or protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid
analysis as described in materials and methods. irreversibly oxidized cysteine was found to be entirely sulfinic acid; sulfonic
acid was not detected in these samples. (detection limit=2.5%).

dtt. fully s-glutathiolated  xxxg294xxx  migrates with a pi of 6.8 (lane 6). when this thiolated form of
 xxxg294xxx  was treated with h2o2, no additional bands appeared on the gel, and all modification
was completely reversible (lanes 7 and 8). these results
indicated that a disulfide bond between  xxxg294xxx  and gsh prevented oxidation of the protein cysteine residues to sulfinic and sulfonic acids.
when h2o2-treated  xxxg294xxx  was analyzed for protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid, the amount of
sulfinic acid was comparable to the amounts of irreversibly oxidized  xxxg294xxx  detected by ief
(figure 2b). sulfonic acid was not detected in these samples, indicating it was not a major product of h2o2-mediated oxidation. untreated  xxxg294xxx  did not
contain a measurable amount of sulfinic or sulfonic acid
(data not shown).
oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  was progressive
with time and reversibility depended on gsh concentration (figure 3). in the absence of gsh (figure 3a), the

the concentration of gsh needed to protect carbonic
anhydrase iii from h2o2-mediated damage was determined at two concentrations (10 µm and 30 µm) of  xxxg294xxx . figure 4a shows that reversible modification (open symbols) reached nearly maximal levels,
and the protein was protected from irreversible oxidation
(closed symbols) by 50 µm gsh at both protein concentrations. at gsh concentrations below 50 µm, irreversible
oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  was dependent on
 xxxg294xxx  concentration. h2o2 caused more
irreversible oxidation at 5 µm and 15 µm gsh at the higher concentration of  xxxg294xxx . complete
protection of 30 µm  xxxg294xxx  from irreversible oxidation required 50 µm gsh, while 10 µm  xxxg294xxx  was maximally protected at 15 µm
gsh. thus, protection of proteins by gsh was efficient
when gsh:protein molar ratios approached one. when 5
µm gsh was present, s-glutathiolated protein accounted
for 50% and 100% of the gsh available in reactions of
h2o2 with 10 µm and 30 µm  xxxg294xxx , respectively. thus, when gsh is limiting, s-glutathiolation
is likely to be the primary function of gsh in protection of
 xxxg294xxx  from irreversible oxidation by
h2o2. at 1.3 mm gsh, 50% of the  xxxg294xxx 
was s-glutathiolated, and none was irreversibly oxidized
(data not shown).  xxxg294xxx  was modified by
h2o2 even when gsh concentrations were 130 times
greater than the protein concentration.

modification by h2o2.
 xxxg294xxx  (10 µm or 30 µm) with the indicated concentrations of gsh was incubated with 2 mm h2o2 for 10 minutes at 37 °c and in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at ph 7.4.
reactions were stopped,  xxxg294xxx  was reduced,
and results were analyzed as in figure 3.

the reaction between  xxxg294xxx  and 75
µm  xxxd2811xxx  produces little protein modification in comparison to that of  xxxg294xxx , 150 µm gsh, and
h2o2 (data not shown).  xxxd2811xxx  clearly is not an intermediate in the s-glutathiolation of  xxxg294xxx  by
h2o2.

by thermal decomposition (figure 5). it has been used as

37 °c in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4. all other conditions were the same as described in figure 2a, except that reactions were stopped with 20 mm nem. (b) the amount of irreversibly oxidized cysteine found in aaph oxidized carbonic
anhydrase iii was determined by densitometry of ief gels or protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid analysis. irreversibly oxidized cysteine was determined to be 25% sulfinic acid, 75% sulfonic acid
in samples treated with aaph alone; 37% sulfinic acid, 63% sulfonic acid in samples treated with aaph in the presence of gsh.

aaph splits homolytically at 37 °c to form 2 mol of alkyl radical per mol of aaph (niki, 1990), which then react quickly with molecular
oxygen to form peroxyradicals.

glutathione and protein protection from oxidative damage

a model for peroxyradical-mediated oxidation both in
vitro and in vivo (thomas et al., 1995a; gesquiere et al.,
1999; marangon et al., 1999; wang and joseph, 1999).
aaph-mediated oxidation produced protein bands
with the same acidic pi’s as those produced by h2o2 (figure 6a, lanes 2 and 3) and an additional band with a more
alkaline pi. these bands were largely insensitive to dtt
reduction. a protein band with a more alkaline pi could
result from the radical addition of a positively charged
amidinopropane group from aaph, or by the loss of a
negative charge by decarboxylation of an acidic amino
acid. it is interesting to note that either s-glutathiolation
(figure 6a) or nem pretreatment (not shown) of carbonic
anhydrase iii prevented formation of the positively
charged band, suggesting that protein cysteine residues
are involved. the modification affected less than 10% of
the protein.
in the presence of gsh, aaph produced reversible oxidation (lanes 4,5) while irreversible oxidation was almost
entirely prevented. when fully s-glutathiolated carbonic
anhydrase iii was treated with aaph, no additional modification of the protein occurred (lanes 7, 8). figure 6b
compares the amount of sulfinic and sulfonic acid in
aaph-oxidized  xxxg294xxx  to the amount of
oxidized protein determined by ief. unlike oxidation with
h2o2, aaph-treated  xxxg294xxx  produced a
considerable amount of cysteine sulfonic acid. seventyfive percent of the irreversibly oxidized cysteine detected
from aaph-treated  xxxg294xxx  was recovered
as sulfonic acid. the presence of gsh decreased the total amount of irreversibly oxidized cysteine detected, and
63% of this was recovered as sulfonic acid. sulfinic and
sulfonic acid were not detected in untreated  xxxg294xxx  or in aaph treated s-glutathiolated carbonic
anhydrase iii (data not shown).
since the ratio of gsh to protein is a critical factor in
preventing oxidative damage to proteins, the effect of
gsh on aaph oxidation was examined in detail. when
gsh was varied from 0 to 150 µm (a five-fold molar excess of gsh), the amount of irreversible damage decreased to less than 5%, while the amount of reversible
oxidation was nearly a mirror image of that effect (figure
7a). total modification of  xxxg294xxx  remained quite constant (approximately 30% of the reactive cysteines were modified). when gsh was raised to
1.3 mm, total protein modification decreased as a result
of the scavenging effect of the free glutathione pool on
peroxyradicals (data not shown). the amount of modification caused by aaph in the presence of gsh could not
be accounted for by the concentration of  xxxd2811xxx  produced by direct oxidation of that molecule (not shown).
when  xxxg294xxx  concentration was varied
from 30 µm to 240 µm during aaph oxidation with 150 µm
gsh, reversible modification increased in proportion to
 xxxg294xxx  concentration (figure 7b). irreversible modification was negligible in this experiment
(data not shown). s-glutathiolation was about 30% at 30
µm  xxxg294xxx  and decreased only slightly to

modification by peroxyradicals.
 xxxg294xxx  was incubated with 50 mm aaph for 20
minutes at 37 °c in sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4. reactions
were stopped,  xxxg294xxx  was reduced, and results
were analyzed as in figure 3. (a)  xxxg294xxx  (30 µm)
was incubated with varying concentrations of gsh in the presence of aaph. (b) aaph was incubated with 30 µm to 240 µm

about 20% modification when carbonic anhydrase concentration was 240 µm. since the amount of s-glutathiolated  xxxg294xxx  increased with  xxxg294xxx  concentration, it appears that carbonic
anhydrase iii trapped peroxyradicals very efficiently.
when the concentration of  xxxg294xxx  was
240 µm, there was 40 µm of protein bound glutathione,
accounting for 25% of the total gsh available. s-glutathiolated protein therefore accounts for a significant
fraction of  xxxd2811xxx  in this experiment.
gsh does not protect hocl-treated carbonic
anhydrase iii by s-glutathiolation
although hocl oxidizes gsh to the sulfonamide (winterbourn and brennan, 1997), less is known about its effect
on protein thiols. the sulfenyl chloride has been proposed as a possible intermediate in the oxidation of gsh
(winterbourn and brennan, 1997; pullar et al., 2001). it
seems likely that such an intermediate would occur with
protein thiols, as well. in the presence of excess gsh,
this intermediate might react to produce an s-glutathiolated protein.
when  xxxg294xxx  was oxidized with hocl
(figure 8a, lanes 2 and 3) the protein migrated to the lower pi’s indicative of irreversibly oxidized  xxxg294xxx . the extent of irreversible oxidation determined
by ief was in agreement with values determined by
analysis of protein sulfinic and sulfonic acids (figure 8b),

of interest with respect to the potential oxidative modifications that might occur in vivo (pullar et al., 2001).
cysteine acts via s-thiolation to protect carbonic
anhydrase iii thiols from oxidative damage

fig. 8 hocl causes irreversible oxidation but not s-glutathiolation of  xxxg294xxx .
(a)  xxxg294xxx  or s-glutathiolated  xxxg294xxx  (30 µm) was incubated with 150 µm hocl for 20 min at
37 °c in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4. all other conditions were the same as described in figure 6. (b) the amount of
irreversibly oxidized cysteine found in hocl oxidized carbonic
anhydrase iii was determined by densitometry of ief gels or protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid analysis. irreversibly oxidized cysteine was determined to be 59% sulfinic acid, 41% sulfonic acid
in samples treated with hocl alone; 25% sulfinic acid, 75% sulfonic acid in samples treated with hocl in the presence of gsh.
the error in the irreversible oxidation analysis by ief is smaller
than the linewidth in this illustration.

gsh has been shown to be the major thiol participating in
s-thiolation reactions in cells (chai et al., 1994). this may
be because of a special affinity of  xxxg1850xxx -thiolation
sites for gsh, or because of the relatively high concentration of gsh compared to other low molecular weight
thiols in cells (mallis and thomas, 2000). we therefore
studied whether cysteine would also protect carbonic
anhydrase iii from oxidative damage by h2o2. when  xxxg294xxx  was incubated with h2o2, 15% of the
reactive cysteines were modified by a single negative
charge (figure 9, second bar). cysteine prevented this
modification by h2o2 as shown by its nearly complete inhibition of negative charge modification (third bar). in order to be able to detect the neutrally charged s-cysteylated  xxxg294xxx , the protein was reacted with
the negatively charged  xxxd3249xxx  iodoacetic acid
(iaa). s-cysteylation appears in this assay as an inhibition
of iaa derivitization, while irreversible oxidation and iaa
derivitization are indistinguishable (thomas et al., 1995a).
when  xxxg294xxx  reacts with iaa, it is modified with a negative charge on 50% of the reactive sites
(fourth bar), which agrees with previously published reports of rat liver  xxxg294xxx  (thomas et al.,
1995a). if  xxxg294xxx  is incubated with h2o2
before iaa derivitization, there is a modest increase in
negatively charged modification (fifth bar). this small increase indicates that little of the modification caused by
h2o2 occurred on the thiol which is does not react with
iaa. only 15% of the reactive cysteines are modified with

of which protein sulfonic acid represented 41% of the total. however, in the presence of excess gsh, about 8%
of the protein reactive cysteine was reversibly modified
(lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that  xxxg1850xxx -glutathiolation
is not a major mechanism occurring with hocl. when
these samples were analyzed for protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid, 20% of the reactive cysteine was irreversibly
oxidized, mostly to the sulfonic acid (75% of the total irreversibly oxidized cysteine). the discrepancy between
the ief analysis and the protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid
analysis could result from the formation of a charge neutral adduct, possibly a form of sulfinamide (raftery et al.,
2001), which was converted to a sulfonic acid during acid
hydrolysis of the protein sample. if this hypothesis is correct, gsh may simply trap hocl, thus delaying oxidation
of a reactive intermediate to the sulfinic or sulfonic acid
and allowing the putative sulfinamide to form. since this
modification apparently results in the formation of sulfonic acid in protein samples with no apparent charge differences, it might in fact be detectable by these characteristics in any protein sample under study. this concept is

mm nem (open bars) or 10 mm iaa (crosshatched bars) as indicated. ief was performed as described in materials and methods. negative charge modification was then calculated as the%

a negative charge when cysteine is present during the reaction of h2o2 with  xxxg294xxx  (sixth bar), indicating that more than 35% of the sites are s-cysteylated. therefore cysteine also acts to protect proteins via
s-thiolation.
gsh protects  xxxg294xxx  from
irreversible oxidation in hepatocytes
since relatively small changes in the molar ratio of gsh
to protein sulfhydryls can have significant effects on the
protection of reactive protein sulfhydryls, the protein
modifications occurring in oxidant-treated rat hepatocytes were studied. because hepatocytes contain a large
amount of endogenous  xxxg294xxx , they provide a suitable model to examine modification of that protein in vivo.
cellular glutathione pools of primary hepatocytes were
depleted with dem, a substrate for cellular glutathione stransferase, and oxidative stress was initiated with  xxxd2563xxx , a redox cycling compound that generates reactive
oxygen species. it has previously been shown that  xxxd2563xxx  promotes s-glutathiolation of carbonic anhydrase
iii as well as other hepatocyte proteins (lii et al., 1994).
figure 10 describes the experimental conditions for depletion of total glutathione by dem. after 20 minutes,
0.03 mm dem depleted total glutathione to 80% of normal, while 2 mm dem depleted total glutathione to 15%
of normal. after a medium change, the cells were incubated with 2 mm  xxxd2563xxx  for 15 minutes and then the
medium was again changed. total glutathione remained
at approximately the same level or increased slightly after
dem-containing medium was removed.  xxxd2563xxx  had
no measurable effect on total glutathione. dem caused
no increase in cell lysis as measured by lactate dehydro-

fig. 10 effects of dem and  xxxd2563xxx  on hepatocyte glutathione.
hepatocytes were first incubated in medium b for 1 h, and dem
was added to a final concentration of 0.03 mm or 2 mm. after 20
min the medium was replaced with fresh medium b and 0.2 mm
 xxxd2563xxx  was added 15 min later. after 15 min medium was replaced with fresh medium a. at the times indicated, cells were
rinsed twice with cold buffered saline and lysed as described in
materials and methods. (a) glutathione is expressed as the
mean of duplicate cultures. duplicates varied by less than 6%.

genase activity found in the culture medium and  xxxd2563xxx  caused only a slight (5%) increase even two hours
after its addition to cells (not shown). thus, the initial loss
in total glutathione with dem treatment was not the result
of a loss of cellular integrity.
modified forms of  xxxg294xxx  in cells were
monitored by ief coupled with western blot analysis (lii
et al., 1994; thomas et al., 1995a). figure 11a shows an
analysis of  xxxg294xxx  after dem and  xxxd2563xxx  treatment of hepatocytes. lanes 1 and 2 are samples of pure  xxxg294xxx  which show the positions of the reduced, singly and doubly s-glutathiolated
forms of the protein. a single irreversibly oxidized form of

rat hepatocytes were treated with dem followed by  xxxd2563xxx 
as described in figure 10.  xxxg294xxx  was separated
by electrofocusing and detected by western blot analysis. a
portion of each sample was treated with 50 mm dithiothreitol before separation by electrofocusing. each pair of lanes shows the
 xxxg294xxx  forms in an untreated and a reduced sample (50 mm dithiothreitol) of the hepatocyte protein mixtures indicated below. each lane contained 0.5 µg total proteins. in panel
(a), lanes 1 and 2 show the reduced, partially s-glutathiolated,
and fully s-glutathiolated forms of  xxxg294xxx . lanes
3,4 contain the protein mixture from untreated hepatocytes.
lanes 5,6 show proteins from cells treated with 2 mm dem for 20
min. lanes 7 and 8 are proteins from untreated cells exposed to
0.2 mm  xxxd2563xxx  for 15 min. in panel (b) hepatocytes were pretreated with either 0.03 mm dem (lanes 1 – 4) or 2 mm dem (lanes
5 – 8) followed by 0.2 mm  xxxd2563xxx  for 15 min. at the times indicated (0 time is the time when  xxxd2563xxx  was added to the
culture) hepatocytes were washed and protein extracts were
prepared.

 xxxg294xxx  resistant to reduction by dtt was
found in untreated hepatocytes (lanes 3,4). serial dilution
of these samples shows that nearly one third of the protein contains a single irreversibly oxidized cysteine (data
not shown). dem (lanes 5,6) had no effect on carbonic
anhydrase iii, while  xxxd2563xxx  caused a reduction-sensitive oxidation on up to two cysteine residues in hepatocytes (lane 7, 8) as reported previously (lii et al., 1994).
dem and  xxxd2563xxx  were used in combination in the experiment shown in figure 11b.  xxxd2563xxx  potentiated a
rapid oxidation within 15 minutes after 0.03 mm dem
treatment (lane 1) that was not completely reversible with
dtt treatment (lane 2, compare to panel a, lane 8). two
hours after the addition of  xxxd2563xxx , s-glutathiolation
had disappeared (lane 3) while irreversible oxidation appears unchanged from that at the initial observation
(compare lane 2 and 4). in a similar experiment where glutathione was more extensively depleted by 2 mm dem,
 xxxd2563xxx  produced less s-glutathiolation (lane 5) and
considerably more irreversible oxidation (lane 6, compare
to panel a, lane 8). two hours later, there was no s-glutathiolated protein and again the irreversibly oxidized
forms persist (lanes 7,8).

livers of older female animals (23 months) contained approximately 1.3 mol %  xxxd519xxx , i. e., a 62%
increase. the difference between young and old female
rats was significantly different by the student’s t-test.
protein sulfonic acid was below detection limits in these
samples (<0.15%).
when the  xxxg294xxx  of old rats was compared to that in young animals, increased irreversible oxidation was observed (figure 12). two gel-based separation methods gave similar results in this experiment. first,
malpeg (wu et al., 2000) was used to derivatize the protein sample since it increases the overall molecular
weight of a protein by 5 kda per reactive thiol (figure
12a). the apparent molecular weight of the malpegtagged protein appears higher than expected when analyzed by sds-page. the addition of the large, uncharged
 xxxd2982xxx  group probably retards the migration
of a protein through the gel since electrophoretic mobility
is a function of both protein charge and size. the reagent
does not react with cysteine residues that are irreversibly
oxidized, and irreversibly oxidized forms of carbonic anhydrase can be separated from undamaged protein by

irreversible oxidation of protein cysteines occur
increasingly with age
one of the hallmarks of the aging process is a decrease
in overall gsh levels (hagen et al., 1999). since glutathione was necessary to protect  xxxg294xxx 
via s-glutathiolation in hepatocytes, it was thought that
aged animals, containing less glutathione than normal,
might have increased protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid.
table 1 shows that the soluble protein fraction from
young rat livers (1 month old male and female) contained
 xxxd519xxx  equivalent to approximately 0.8 mol
% of the total protein cysteine content. the livers of older male animals (16 months) contained approximately 1.1

glutathione and protein protection from oxidative damage

sds-page western blots. as described previously
(cabiscol and levine, 1995), the  xxxg294xxx 
level was five-fold higher in young rats than in old rats
(data not shown). it was necessary to normalize the samples from young and old rat for this difference in  xxxg294xxx . in a control experiment, pure carbonic
anhydrase iii, added to young and old rat liver extracts,
migrated as a single band on sds-page gels with a molecular size of 30 kda, while malpeg-treated carbonic
anhydrase iii was approximately 72 kda (not shown). the
left lane in figure 12a shows a sample in which equal
amounts of reduced  xxxg294xxx  were mixed
with malpeg-derivatized  xxxg294xxx  before
gel separation. the two lanes on the right were obtained
from malpeg-treated protein extracts from young and
old animals. the  xxxg294xxx  from older rats
contained an increased amount of  xxxg294xxx 
that did not react with malpeg (two bands with lower molecular size). an analysis of these protein samples by ief
gels gave similar results (figure 12b). the sample from
old rats showed a significant increase in the amount of
protein focusing with a pi of 7.2, i. e., protein with one irreversibly oxidized reactive sulfhydryl, and even a faint
band with a pi of 6.8 that corresponds to protein with
damage to both reactive sulfhydryls.
gel-based methods of analysis can be quantified by
densitometry, but since malpeg-derivitization produces

657

a significant broadening of the derivatized band it is not
as amenable to such evaluation as the electrofocusing
gels. quantification of the ief gel results showed that the
 xxxg294xxx  in young rats contained 1.5% of
the total cysteine as irreversibly oxidized forms while the
old rats contain approximately 2.5% oxidized. since only
two of the cysteines in  xxxg294xxx  are reactive
and the protein contains 5 cysteines, the observed oxidation represents 3.7% of the reactive cysteine in young
animals and 6.2% in old animals. when these data are
compared to the total protein cysteine pool (data from
table 1), it appears that the oxidation state of carbonic
anhydrase iii is similar to or slightly higher than the entire
protein pool.

discussion
the experiments presented here suggest that three distinct mechanisms for protection of protein cysteines may
be important during oxidative stress (figure 13). first, an
oxidant can react directly with a protein molecule (probably by oxidation of a variety of different exposed protein
structural components), resulting in the formation of a
partially oxidized protein cysteine residue that is activated for further reaction with other cellular constituents. a
protein thiyl radical, protein cysteine thioperoxide, pro-

fig. 13 mechanisms for protection of protein cysteine from irreversible oxidation.
oxidants (lower left corner of figure) react with the protein to form an activated intermediate, (denoted s*, e. g. thiyl radical or cysteine
sulfenic acid), which then reacts with gsh to form s-glutathiolated protein or may react with oxidants or o2 to form protein cysteine
sulfinic (so2) or sulfonic acid (so3). oxidants can also react with gsh to form an activated intermediate, gs*, which then reacts with a
protein sulfhydryl to form s-glutathiolated protein or with gsh to form  xxxd2811xxx . while  xxxd2811xxx  may s-glutathiolate proteins, the rate of this
reaction is slow in comparison to the direct oxidation mechanisms discussed above.

tein cysteine thioperoxyradical, or protein cysteine
sulfenic acid (stortz et al., 1990; thomas et al., 1995b;
denu and tanner, 1998; winterbourn and metodiewa,
1999) might represent the partially oxidized protein cysteine. this modified cysteine most frequently reacts with
gsh to form the s-glutathiolated protein because of the
abundance of gsh as a reactant. this mechanism suggests an antioxidant role of gsh that has not previously
been appreciated. thus, if the concentration of gsh is
decreased, the activated protein sulfhydryl intermediate
might instead react with molecular oxygen or some other
oxidant which can result in further oxidation of the cysteine to forms that seem to be metabolically inert, i. e., irreversibly oxidized. protein cysteine sulfinic or cysteine
sulfonic acid (figures 2 and 6) are possibly the major
highly oxidized forms of cysteine present in normal cells.
second, the oxidant may react first with gsh to form an
activated form of glutathione, which then reacts with protein cysteine to form s-glutathiolated protein. finally, the
oxidant might react with glutathione exclusively and
thereby form significant amounts of  xxxd2811xxx . since  xxxd2811xxx 
can potentially react with protein sulfhydryls to form sglutathiolated species, the possibility of protein modification by this mechanism is dependent on formation of significant amounts of  xxxd2811xxx . however, the reaction of
 xxxd2811xxx  with  xxxg294xxx  (and other proteins as
well) appears to be too slow to generate significant s-thiolated protein in cells (mallis et al., 2001). although these
mechanisms are all of potential importance, most data
suggest that the first mechanism is of primary importance in vivo. since this mechanism also provides a
unique hypothesis for the potential role of glutathione as
a trapping antioxidant for damaged protein sulfhydryls, it
is well suited to explain the results of the experiments reported in this manuscript.
oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  with hocl, aaph
or h2o2 produced considerable irreversible oxidation in
the absence of gsh. multiple acidic bands are generated
on the ief separation which are not reducible by dtt
treatment. these bands also occur in oxidation of  xxxg294xxx  by a variety of other mechanisms (lii
et al., 1994; thomas et al., 1995a; thomas and mallis,
2001). reactions between thiols and reactive oxygen
species often result in the formation of sulfinic acid or sulfonic acid (wefers and sies, 1983; miller and claiborne,
1991; yeh et al., 1996; becker et al., 1999; hamann, et al.,
2001), both of which are negatively charged sulfur compounds. indeed, hocl, aaph and h2o2 treatment of  xxxg294xxx  all result in the formation of protein
 xxxd519xxx  (figure 2) or both sulfinic and sulfonic acid (figures 6 and 8). gsh prevented irreversible
oxidation by aaph or h2o2 and simultaneously participated in s-glutathiolation of  xxxg294xxx  (figures 2 and 6). the protection of  xxxg294xxx 
and formation of s-glutathiolated protein was dependent
on the concentration of gsh relative to the concentration
of the protein. additionally, as s-glutathiolation increased, irreversible oxidation decreased in a gsh-de-

pendent manner. this suggests that s-glutathiolation is
linked to the prevention of irreversible oxidation (park and
thomas, 1988; lii et al., 1994; thomas et al., 1995b). indeed, when s-glutathiolated  xxxg294xxx  was
treated with the oxidants used in this study, formation of
irreversibly oxidized  xxxg294xxx  was not observed (figures 1, 4, and 6). while it is not unreasonable
to expect that a disulfide bond between protein cysteine
and glutathione could be oxidized to forms such as thiosulfinate esters, it is probable that these reactions are
significantly less favorable than oxidation of a protein thiol to a disulfide.
at lower gsh concentrations, initial oxidation of both
proteins and glutathione are possible, since s-glutathiolated protein is a measured endpoint in both reactions.
the increase in total protein modification at low gsh
concentrations suggests either that initial formation of
 xxxd2811xxx  is an important mechanism, or that
formation of irreversible oxidation products is less favored than the s-glutathiolation reaction. because formation of  xxxd519xxx  and cysteine sulfonic acid
require multiple oxidation events, this supposition is reasonable. s-glutathiolation of  xxxg294xxx  remained extensive when gsh was several-fold more concentrated than the protein. this indicates that interaction
of oxidant with the protein is important. the fact that irreversible oxidation occurs and that levels of irreversible
oxidation in the absence of gsh are comparable to levels
of total oxidation in the presence of gsh is further evidence that the protein reacts directly with the oxidant.
 xxxd2811xxx  formation is not an important mechanism of sglutathiolation in hocl, aaph or h2o2-mediated oxidation, and so  xxxd2811xxx  formation may be important only at
very high gsh:protein ratios. this corroborates studies
with purified h-ras in reactions with h2o2 and gsh
(mallis et al., 2001), suggesting that this is a general phenomenon for proteins and not limited to  xxxg294xxx . in reactions using rat liver  xxxg294xxx 
(thomas and mallis, 2001), identical molar ratios of
gsh:protein (approximately 10:1) produced a wide variety of results depending on the oxidant. this shows that
 xxxg294xxx  is an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species, but that its scavenging ability is
heavily dependent on the nature of the oxidant.
the reaction of h2o2 with  xxxg294xxx  and
cysteine shows that cysteine is as effective as an s-thiolating agent as gsh when  xxxg294xxx  is the
protein substrate. if  xxxg294xxx  is typical of
cytosolic proteins with reactive cysteines, then the predominance of s-glutathiolated proteins in oxidized cells
is likely the result of the greater concentration of gsh in
cells (chai et al., 1994). since  xxxg294xxx  does
not appear to have a binding site for gsh (mallis et al.,
2000), this result should be relevant to many surface-exposed cysteine sites on proteins.
a previous study using bso to deplete glutathione in
hepatocytes had shown formation of irreversibly oxidized
 xxxg294xxx  with  xxxd2563xxx  (lii et al., 1994).

glutathione and protein protection from oxidative damage

the present experiments suggests that a minimal depletion of cellular glutathione may allow  xxxd2563xxx  to cause
irreversible oxidation of  xxxg294xxx . further
depletion results in extensive irreversible oxidation. using dem to deplete cellular glutathione has the advantage over using bso in that the depletion occurs within
20 minutes. thus, the irreversible oxidation does not
seem to be a result of long-term secondary effects of glutathione depletion, but rather is likely to be the direct result of gsh deficiency. the results obtained with the purified protein show that decreasing the amount of
available gsh is sufficient to result in irreversibly oxidized
protein instead of s-glutathiolated protein and thus, the
same is likely to be true in vivo. because irreversibly oxidized  xxxg294xxx  increased slightly with
 xxxd2563xxx  treatment after a minimal depletion of gsh,
the concentration of gsh in hepatocytes may be just sufficient to protect the proteins in these cells from oxidative
damage. this implies that in disease states where glutathione is depressed, there may be a significant impact
on the protein pool even in situations when the depression is minimal. the persistence of irreversibly oxidized
forms for over two hours after  xxxd2563xxx  challenge suggests that turnover of irreversible oxidation products is
quite slow and buildup of damaged proteins can occur
over time. this is borne out by the observed increase in
irreversible modification of  xxxg294xxx  and in
 xxxd519xxx  content overall in rat livers of older
animals versus younger animals. the fact that a variety of
oxidants produced either cysteine sulfinic or sulfonic
acid in vitro and that sulfinic acid is found in the proteins
of young and old animals suggests that these irreversible
modifications are important cellular modifications warranting further study.
finally, the reaction mechanisms postulated here
strongly suggest that regulation of proteins can occur
through s-glutathiolation without the necessity of forming  xxxd2811xxx  as an intermediate. this makes s-glutathiolation a plausible initial event in the activation of signaling
cascades by oxidants. while the prevention of irreversible oxidation by s-glutathiolation has obvious value
in preserving the function of cysteine-containing proteins, progressive irreversible oxidation of cysteines may
contribute to degeneration of signaling seen in aging,
cancer and other disease states (liu et al., 1996; rattan
and clark, 1996; barrett et al., 1999a, b; navarro et al.,
1999).

protein assay
protein concentrations were determined as described by lowry
et al. (1951).
isoelectric focusing (ief) of  xxxg294xxx 
purified  xxxg294xxx  was separated on horizontal slab
gels [5.0% (acrylamide/2.7% bisacrylamide)/0.3% ampholyte
ph 4.0 – 6.0/1.7% ampholyte ph 5.0 – 8.0] at 1500 v and 1.1
w/cm for 50 minutes as previously described for rat liver  xxxg294xxx  (chai et al., 1991). the reduced form of the
human erythrocyte enzyme separated at pi 7.6, a slightly more
basic pi than the rat liver enzyme (reduced form pi=7.0) used
previously in this laboratory (chai et al., 1991). gels were stained
with coomassie brilliant blue r-250 and air-dried.
quantification of ief gels
gels were scanned and bands were quantified using imagequant v3.3 (molecular dynamics inc.). the extent of modification of  xxxg294xxx  was calculated by determining relative band densities within individual lanes. the percent
modification of  xxxg294xxx  reactive cysteines was
calculated from the following relationship:
% modification = (density of band with 1 oxidized cysteine
+ 2× density of bands with 2 oxidized cysteines)/
(2× density of all bands) × 100%
reversible modification is the difference in % modification between dtt-untreated and dtt-treated lanes. irreversible modification is the % modification in dtt-treated lanes.
protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid analysis
samples were analyzed for irreversibly oxidized forms of cysteine (hamann et al., 2001). briefly, samples were denatured by
incubation at 37 °c for 15 min in 120 mm phosphate buffer, ph
7.4 containing 7 m urea and 10 mm dtt. the samples were then
treated with 40 mm iam and incubated at room temperature for
20 min to block any remaining reduced cysteine residues. each
sample was split into two fractions, one of which was treated
with 10 mm hocl for 5 min at room temperature in order to oxidize sulfinic acids to sulfonic acids. the reactions were terminated after five minutes with the addition of 30 mm dtt. the
samples were extensively dialyzed and hydrolyzed by vapor
phase acid. amino acid analysis was conducted using precolumn derivatization with opa, and the amino acids were separat-

ed by reverse phase hplc. individual samples of hydrolyzed
 xxxg294xxx  were compared by determining the moles
of leucine in each sample. since carbonic anyhydrase iii contains 22 leucine residues, the total leucine was divided by 22 to
determine the moles of carbonic anyhydrase iii. the percent of
reactive cysteine converted to cysteic acid was calculated according to the following relationship:
% cysteic acid = (mol of cysteic acid/2 reactive cysteine
residues)/(mol of carbonic anyhydrase iii) ×
100%
hocl converts sulfinic to sulfonic acid; therefore, the percent of
cysteic acid found in a sample treated with hocl represents the
percent of total irreversibly oxidized reactive cysteine. cysteic
acid found in samples not treated with hocl represents the percent of reactive cysteine detected as protein sulfonic acid. the
percent of protein sulfinic acid can be calculated by subtracting
the total protein sulfonic acid from the total irreversibly oxidized
cysteine.
liver protein extracts were compared on the basis of total
cysteine content. the molar amount of cysteic acid detected
was divided by the total mol of cysteine detected.
hepatocyte isolation and culture
male sprague-dawley rats (200 – 250 grams) were from sasco
co. (omaha, usa). water and a crude cereal-based diet were offered freely. hepatocytes were isolated by perfusion with 0.05%
collagenase as described (thomas et al., 1995a). a male rat was
anesthetized with  xxxd3183xxx  sodium (100 mg/kg body
weight), and the liver was perfused at 37°c through the portal
vein with 0.05% type i collagenase. after approximately 15 min
of perfusion, the liver was removed, sieved through nylon mesh,
and cells were washed with l-15 medium. the cells were suspended in a 10% percoll solution and centrifuged to separate
parenchymal cells from dead cells. isolated hepatocytes
(0.5×106 cells/ml) were plated on collagen precoated culture
plates in medium a (leibovitz’s l-15 medium, ph 7.6, supplemented with 18 mm hepes, 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 5
µg/ml insulin/transferrin, 1 µm dexamethasone, 5 mg/ml galactose, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 100 iu/ml  xxxd2871xxx , and 100
mg/ml streptomycin sulfate). cell viability was greater than 90%
by trypan blue exclusion. the culture medium was changed after 5 h to remove dead and unattached cells and again after 24
h. hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h before starting experiments.
hepatocytes that would be treated with diethyl maleate (dem)
and  xxxd2563xxx  were first incubated in medium b (leibovitz’
medium without bsa, insulin, transferrin and dexamethasone)
for 1 h. dem was added to this culture medium and the medium
was replaced with fresh medium b for subsequent cell treatment. after a 15 min equilibration,  xxxd2563xxx  (in a dmso vehicle) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. the final concentration of dmso was 0.2% in the medium. since dmso did
not cause  xxxg1850xxx -thiolation, alter cellular glutathione, or alter
the cellular response to  xxxd2563xxx , it was not directly added to
control cultures in the experiments described here.  xxxd2563xxx 
was left on the cultures for 15 min, then the medium was removed, and cells were incubated in medium a for up to 24 h.
hepatocyte extract preparation
if glutathione was to be determined, experiments were terminated by rinsing the cells twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs). cells were immediately placed in 250 µl cold buffer containing 20 mm hepes, 5 mm edta, 5 mm egta, 1 mm pmsf, 1
mm  xxxd302xxx , and 5 µg/ml leupeptin, ph 7.4. cells were

completely disrupted with a small cell homogenizer, and homogenates were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 g at 4° for 30 min. an
aliquot of each culture extract was treated with sulfosalicylic
acid (final concentration was 10%) and the acid-soluble material was used to measure total glutathione by the dtnb- xxxg981xxx  recycling method (tietze, 1969).
for preparation of protein extracts of hepatocytes, washed
cell cultures were lysed as above in 20 mm hepes, 5 mm edta,
and 5 mm egta, ph 7.4, containing 50 mm  xxxd2684xxx . nethyl maleimide reacts with protein and non-protein sulfhydryls
rapidly to prevent artifactual modification of protein sulfhydryls
during sample preparation. two aliquots of each sample were
prepared, one of which was treated with 50 mm dithiothreitol at
37° for 20 min before separation on electrofocusing gels.
electrofocusing/western blot analysis of protein extracts
the molecular forms of  xxxg294xxx  in protein extracts
were determined by separation on ief gels as described above.
this separation was combined with antibody detection after
transfer to pvdf membranes as previously described (lii et al.,
1994; thomas et al., 1995). the electrofocusing gel containing
netfix was separated from the gelbond, equilibrated with cold
0.7% acetic acid for 15 min, and transferred at constant voltage,
12 v or 15 v (3 ma/cm2) for 30 min in a bio-rad trans-blot sd
semi-dry transfer cell (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, usa).
because proteins have a net positive charge in acetic acid, they
were transferred to the membrane placed on the cathodic side
of the gel. the pvdf membrane was washed with 150 mm nacl,
15 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, containing 0.3% tween-20, and incubated with a rabbit anti- xxxg294xxx  antiserum (supplied by s. hendrich, iowa state university, usa). anti-rabbit
igg alkaline phosphatase conjugate from sigma chemical company, along with p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (nbt) and 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, were used to visualize the
bound  xxxg294xxx  antibody.
lactate dehydrogenase activity
medium was collected from hepatocytes and lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured directly with ldh lactate-dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.27) uv-test from sigma. total cellular lactate dehydrogenase was determined by lysing washed cells in
250 µl 20 mm hepes, 5 mm edta, 5 mm egta, 1 mm pmsf, 1 mm
 xxxd302xxx , and 5 µg/ml leupeptin, ph 7.4 buffer. the particlefree cellular supernatant was prepared by centrifugation and
used to determine lactate dehydrogenase activity.
preparation of soluble liver protein extracts from young
and old rats
one month and 16 month old male, and one month and 23
month old female fisher 344 rats were used. food (teklad diet #
7002) and water were provided ad libitum. rats were sacrificed
by co2 inhalation, the liver was removed, rinsed with ice cold
saline, and frozen immediately using a liquid nitrogen cooled
clamp. livers were powdered using a liquid nitrogen cooled,
stainless steel mortar and pestle and stored at – 80° until use.
soluble liver protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing
liver tissue in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm beta-glycerophosphate, 10 mm dtt, 5 mm edta, and 5 mm egta, ph 7.4)
the homogenate was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 10 min at 4 °c,
the supernatant was recovered, and centrifuged in a beckman
airfuge ultracentrifuge at 160 000 g for 30 min (twice). the soluble protein extract produced by this procedure was incubated at
37 °c for 30 min to remove any dtt reversible modifications prior to protein sulfinic and sulfonic acid analysis or malpeg analysis.

glutathione and protein protection from oxidative damage

malpeg analysis of protein extracts
soluble liver protein extracts were diluted ten-fold in 20 mm betaglycerophosphate buffer, ph 7.4, containing 5 mm malpeg.
samples were applied to a 10% sds-page gel. proteins were
transferred to pvdf membrane, and  xxxg294xxx  was
detected as described above, with the exception that the gel
was equilibrated in buffer containing 48 mm tris, 39 mmv glycine,
1.3 mm sds, and 20% methanol prior to transfer. anti-rabbit igg
horseradish peroxidase conjugate with ecl chemiluminescent
detection from amersham pharmacia biotech (piscataway,
usa), was used to visualize the bound  xxxg294xxx 
antibody.
