acute methadone treatment reduces myocardial infarct size via the delta-opioid receptor in rats during reperfusion.  methadone is an opioid agonist often given to manage acute and chronic pain. we sought to determine whether methadone compared with morphine dose dependently reduces myocardial infarct size (is) and whether the mechanism is delta-opioid receptor mediated. furthermore, we examined whether myocardial is reduction varies with the timing of methadone administration or duration of induced ischemia.
