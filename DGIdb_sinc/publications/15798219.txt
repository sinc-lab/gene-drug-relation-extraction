ctp: xxxd2929xxx  cytidylyltransferase (cct) catalyzes a rate-controlling step in the biosynthesis of
phosphatidylcholine (ptdcho). multiple cct isoforms, cct␣, cct␤2, and cct␤3, are encoded by two genes,
 xxxg1686xxx  and  xxxg1687xxx . the importance of cct␣ in mice was investigated by deleting exons 5 and 6 in the  xxxg1686xxx 
gene using the cre-lox system. pcyt1aⴚ/ⴚ zygotes failed to form blastocysts, did not develop past embryonic day
3.5 (e3.5), and failed to implant. in situ hybridization in e11.5 embryos showed that  xxxg1686xxx  is expressed
ubiquitously, with the highest level in fetal liver, and cct␣ transcripts are significantly more abundant than
transcripts encoding cct␤ or phosphatidylethanolamine (ptdetn) n-methyl transferase, two other enzymes
capable of producing ptdcho. reduction of the cct␣ transcripts in heterozygous e11.5 embryos was accompanied by upregulation of cct␤ and ptdetn n-methyltransferase transcripts. in contrast, enzymatic and
real-time pcr data revealed that cct␤ ( xxxg1687xxx ) expression is not upregulated to compensate for the reduction
in cct␣ expression in adult liver and other tissues from pcyt1aⴙ/ⴚ heterozygous mice. ptdcho biosynthesis
measured by choline incorporation into isolated hepatocytes was not compromised in the pcyt1aⴙ/ⴚ mice. liver
ptdcho mass was the same in pcyt1aⴙ/ⴙ and pcyt1aⴙ/ⴚ adult animals, but lung ptdcho mass decreased in the
heterozygous mice. these data show that cct␣ expression is required for early embryonic development, but
that a 50% reduction in enzyme activity has little detectable impact on the operation of the cdp-choline
metabolic pathway in adult tissues.
similar catalytic and membrane interaction domains. an amphipathic helix in the membrane interaction domain regulates
enzyme activity by controlling the reversible interaction of the
protein with phospholipid bilayers (8). however, cct␣ has a
nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal domain and is
found predominantly in the nucleus (22, 23), while cct␤ lacks
this signal and localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum and in
the cytosol (13). the cct␣ isoform is the product of the
 xxxg1686xxx  gene and is ubiquitously expressed in cell lines and
animal tissues, whereas the cct␤2 and cct␤3 isoforms are
the products of the mouse  xxxg1687xxx  gene and are most highly
expressed in the brain (9, 11, 13). disruption of cct␤2 expression results in gonadal dysfunction in mice, but the mice
are otherwise normal, including the histology of the brain (9),
illustrating that cct␣ and cct␤3 can substitute for cct␤2
function in most tissues. a mouse conditional knockout model
to study the role of cct␣ in specific tissues was developed
(24). the selective deletion of cct␣ expression in cells of the
macrophage lineage showed a surprisingly mild phenotype
(24). the mice had normal numbers of macrophages, and
macrophage development was supported in these cells by the
upregulation of  xxxg1687xxx  gene expression. similarly, the liverspecific knockout of cct␣ yielded viable mice with visually
normal livers (10). although these animals had reduced
ptdcho levels both in their liver and in serum lipoproteins, it is
clear that cct␣ is not essential for liver development, due to
the expression of  xxxg1482xxx  or perhaps cct␤. these two experiments with conditional knockouts suggested that the hypothesis that cct␣ is essential for mammalian cell survival may not
be correct and prompted us to determine if one could derive
mice that lack the expression of the  xxxg1686xxx  gene in all tissues

phosphatidylcholine (ptdcho) is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian cells and plays an important structural
role in cellular membranes and lipoprotein metabolism (8, 20).
the cdp-choline pathway is the primary route to ptdcho, and
ctp: xxxd2929xxx  cytidylyltransferase (cct) is the ratecontrolling enzyme in this three-step pathway. cct activity is
tightly regulated by its reversible interaction with lipid regulators and protein phosphorylation (8, 20). a second route to
ptdcho is the phosphatidylethanolamine (ptdetn) n-methyltransferase ( xxxg1482xxx ) reaction; however, this pathway is thought
to be only of significant importance in the liver (19, 21).
 xxxg1482xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have a mild phenotypic defect in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism (15) but die when choline starvation is
used to eliminate the cdp-choline pathway for ptdcho synthesis in the liver (21), illustrating that  xxxg1482xxx  is an important
alternate route to ptdcho in the liver. esko et al. (6) developed
a temperature-sensitive cell line that was conditionally defective in cct activity, and when this cell line is shifted to the
nonpermissive temperature ptdcho synthesis ceases, cell
growth halts, and apoptosis ensues (4). similar results are
obtained using chemical inhibitors of cct (2, 16). these results led to the hypothesis that cct is essential for mammalian
cell survival.
complexity was introduced into the field with the discovery
of a second cct isoform, called cct␤ (13, 14). cct␣ and
cct␤ are highly related proteins. both proteins have very

targeted disruption of the mouse  xxxg1686xxx  gene. homozygous pcyt1aflox mice
were derived previously (10, 24) and crossed with transgenic strain fvb/ntgn( xxxg53xxx -cre)2mrt (the jackson laboratory, bar harbor, maine) expressing
cre recombinase driven by the human ␤-actin gene promoter. the floxed  xxxg1686xxx 
locus in the resulting heterozygous embryos was deleted by the blastocyst stage
of development, and the heterozygous pups carrying a wild-type and a deleted
 xxxg1686xxx  gene were identified by pcr-mediated genotyping of tail dna as described below. the heterozygous mice were intercrossed and anticipated to yield
embryos and pups which were wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous for a
deleted  xxxg1686xxx  allele in a 1:2:1 ratio. littermates were used as comparison
controls.
genotyping. the  xxxg1686xxx  genotypes were assessed by pcr analysis of genomic
dna extracted from mouse tails or embryos by incubation overnight at 55°c in
50 ␮l of lysis buffer made up of 20 mm nacl, 50 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm disodium
edta (na2edta), 1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx , and 1 mg of proteinase k/ml.
aliquots of the digestion mixture were used in a pcr with redtaq genomic
dna polymerase (sigma). two sets of primers, illustrated in fig. 1, detected the
wild-type or the  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ allele. the sequence of forward primer 1 (fp1) was
5⬘-aatgtcttccaggctccatagg; fp2 was 5⬘-gaacttagggcctta
ttcaaagc; rp1 was 5⬘-ttgcctggtttgtgtttatgc. primers fp1 and
rp1 yielded a 255-bp product specific for the wild-type allele, and primers fp2
and rp1 yielded a 255-bp fragment specific for the deleted  xxxg1686xxx  allele. the
pcr consisted of an initial incubation at 94°c for 2 min, then five cycles at 94°c
for 30 s and 65°c for 30 s; and another five cycles at 94°c for 30 s, 63°c for 30 s,
and 72°c for 1 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°c for 30 s, 60°c for 30 s, and 72°c
for 5 min. the amplified dna fragments were distinguished by agarose gel
electrophoresis. preimplantation embryos were collected from pregnant dams on
e3.5, where the morning of the day on which a vaginal plug was detected was
designated day e0.5. the uterine horns were flushed with hepes-buffered m2
culture medium and transferred into individual eppendorf tubes containing 5 ␮l
of lysis buffer (0.05% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  and 0.035 n naoh) by using a
mouth pipette assembly. the samples were boiled for 3 min, and 2.5 ␮l of this
mixture was used in the pcr with either primer set fp1 and rp1 or primer set
fp2 and rp1. the pcr products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. due to
their low yield, they were detected by southern blot hybridization with radiolabeled probes corresponding to the sequences amplified by the primers fp1 and
rp1 or fp2 and rp1, as appropriate. blots were visualized using a typhoon 9200
phosphorimager (molecular dynamics). the probe templates had previously
been cloned into the pcr2.1 vector, and the dna sequences were confirmed by
the hartwell center for biotechnology at st. jude children’s research hospital.
in situ hybridization. riboprobe templates were generated by pcr from
plasmid dna containing the cdna from  xxxg1686xxx  (nm_00981.2) nucleotides (nt)
1088 to 1662,  xxxg1687xxx  (nm177546) nt 1358 to 1944, and  xxxg1482xxx  (bc026796.1) nt 26
to 651. the 3⬘-untranslated regions of  xxxg1686xxx  and  xxxg1687xxx  were selected as templates to achieve sufficient sequence diversity between these two transcripts, and
the cdna sequences were verified by the hartwell center for biotechnology.
the templates were cloned into pbluescript, and t7 rna polymerase was used
for in vitro transcription reactions to generate [␣-33p]utp antisense radiolabeled riboprobes for in situ hybridization. e11.5 embryos were removed from the
mother by cesarean section and immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1
m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) for 24 h. embryos were cryoprotected in
30% sucrose (in pbs) and embedded in triangle biosciences freezing medium
and frozen on dry ice. sixteen-micrometer tissue sections in the sagittal plane
were cut using a cryostat, and tissues were mounted onto superfrost plus microscope slides. several slides with e11.5 tissue were processed identically as the
experimental slides, except that they were not hybridized with probe, to document the background signal from the tissues. gene expression was evaluated by
in situ hybridization as described previously (17, 18). microscope slides were
dipped in nbt2 liquid emulsion, and autoradiography proceeded for 9 days at
4°c. nbt2 emulsion-treated slides were developed in kodak d19 developer and
fixer before slides were dehydrated and coverslips were attached with permount.
all treatments, hybridizations, and wash conditions were identical for the probes
used in this assay. a nearby section in the tissue block used was stained with

targeted disruption of the  xxxg1686xxx  gene results in early embryonic lethality.  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice were intercrossed to obtain
 xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, and we investigated the phenotype associated
with homozygous cct␣ deficiency. the genotypes of the offspring were determined by pcr analysis of tail dna at age 3
weeks. from 120 pups total, 40 were wild type and 80 were
heterozygous, but no homozygous mutant mice were obtained
(table 2) and no neonatal deaths occurred. these data suggested that  xxxg1686xxx  gene deficiency caused embryonic lethality.
to determine the time of embryonic death, timed-pregnant
mice were euthanized at day e11.5, embryos were removed,
and embryonic dna was analyzed for the presence of wildtype and deleted  xxxg1686xxx  genes. of 60 embryos analyzed, 19
were wild type and 41 were heterozygous for the  xxxg1686xxx  deletion, but no  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos were identified (table 2).
thus,  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos appeared to die before day e11.5. to
identify further the time of embryonic death, timed matings
were done and day e3.5 preimplantation embryos were isolated by flushing the uterine horns. analysis of the embryonic
dna by pcr followed by southern blotting demonstrated the
presence of 10  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos out of 44 total. we noted
that all of the homozygous  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos exhibited retarded development at day e3.5. whereas the vast majority of
both wild-type and heterozygous embryos were blastocysts
composed of a hollow trophoectoderm surrounding a fluidfilled cavity, with a small group of internal cavity mass cells as

each tissue were averaged and compared using the ct method, where the
amount of target rna (2⫺⌬⌬ct) was normalized to the endogenous  xxxg861xxx 
reference (⌬ct) and related to the amount of target cct␣ in liver from
 xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ mice (⌬⌬ct), which was set as the calibrator at 1.0. standard deviations from the mean ⌬ct values were ⬍10%.
cct enzyme activity. cct activities in murine tissues of adult  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ and
 xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice were determined essentially as described previously (12). selected organs from  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ and  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice were lysed in a dounce
homogenizer and cold 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 5 mm na2edta, 1 ␮m
na3vo4, 5 mm naf, 2% aprotinin, 10 ␮g of leupeptin/ml, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the lysate was centrifuged at 2,000 ⫻ g for 20 min at 4°c
to remove large debris. protein concentration was determined according to the
method of bradford using gamma globulin as a standard (3). the standard assay
mixture contained 150 mm bis-tris-hcl (ph 6.5), 10 mm mgcl2, 4 mm ctp,
100 ␮m lipid vesicles (ptdcho: xxxd2777xxx , 1:1), and 1 mm phospho[methyl14
c]choline (american radiolabeled chemicals; specific activity, 4.5 mci/mmol)
in a final volume of 50 ␮l. the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°c for 10 min.
the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ␮l of 0.5 m na2edta, and the
tubes were vortexed and placed on ice. next, 40 ␮l of each sample was spotted
onto a preadsorbent silica gel g thin-layer plate (analtech), which was developed in 2% ammonium hydroxide, 95% ethanol (1:1, vol/vol). cdp–[methyl14
c]choline was identified by comigration with authentic radiolabeled standard
(american radiolabeled chemicals). cct activity was calculated from a series
of assays that were linear with time and protein.
metabolic labeling. fresh livers were harvested from adult  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ and
 xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice, rinsed in buffer containing 66.7 mm nacl, 6.7 mm kcl, 100 mm
hepes (ph 7.6), and 36 mm glucose, and chopped with a mcllwain tissue
chopper (the vibratome company, o’fallon, mo.). the minced tissue was
digested in the same buffer plus 5 mm cacl2 䡠 2h2o, collagenase (0.5 mg/ml),
and dnase (6 ␮g/ml) for 20 min at 37°c three times successively. the debris was
allowed to settle each time, and the supernatant containing the cell suspension
was collected. after filtering the combined cell suspension through 41-␮m spectra/mesh nylon (fisher scientific), the hepatocytes in the filtrate were collected
by centrifugation at 100 ⫻ g for 2 min and washed three times with buffer
containing 137 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 0.65 mm mg2so4 䡠 7h2o, 1.2 mm
cacl2 䡠 2h2o, 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4), and 15 mg of bovine  xxxg124xxx /ml.
the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of dulbecco’s pbs containing 5 mm glucose
and 3.3 mm pyruvate plus 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx . cells were counted using
a hemocytometer, and viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. cells
were incubated at 37°c with aeration and gentle mixing in the same buffer with
3 ␮ci of [methyl-3h]choline/ml for up to 6 h. after incubation, cells were
transferred to ice and washed three times with pbs, and the cell pellets were
extracted using a two-phase system (1) to separate the chloroform-soluble metabolites. the amount of radiolabel incorporated into ptdcho (⬎95% of the
total) in the organic phase was determined by scintillation counting.
lipid determinations. flash-frozen liver or lung tissue was thawed and
weighed, and approximately 50 mg was extracted by the method of bligh and
dyer (1). the organic phase containing lipid was concentrated under nitrogen
and resuspended in 400 ␮l of chloroform-methanol (2:1). a 1-␮l aliquot was
loaded onto a thin-layer silica gel rod, developed first in ether, dried, and then
developed in chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-water (50:25:8:3) for phospholipid determinations or hexane- xxxd2052xxx -acetic acid (80:20:0.5) for neutral lipid
determinations. lipid mass was detected by flame ionization using an iatroscan
instrument (iatron laboratories, inc., tokyo, japan) with peak simple software (sri instruments), and peaks were identified by comigration with authentic
standards. ptdcho mass was calculated using a standard curve prepared with egg
ptdcho (matreya, inc.).

relative expression in embryos (fig. 1d), suggesting that these
genes play a larger role in embryo development, with the
exception of the  xxxg1482xxx  in adult liver. we cannot evaluate how
much the slight, and perhaps insignificant, elevation of cct␤
expression contributes to total ptdcho production in adult
tissues, but the data suggest that cct␣ expression is sufficient
in the  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ animals, since there are no overt phenotypic
differences compared to wild type.
ptdcho biosynthesis in tissues. the biochemical consequence of disruption of one  xxxg1686xxx  allele on cct␣ protein and
enzyme activity was determined by measuring the cct specific
activity in tissue lysates (fig. 3a) and in intact hepatocytes
isolated from wild-type and heterozygous mice (fig. 3b).
within each tissue, the activity from  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice decreased
significantly, by about 50% in most tissues compared with
 xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ littermate controls (fig. 3a). whereas the lung had
a higher cct␣ transcript abundance than the liver, the cct
enzyme specific activity was higher in liver compared to lung,
probably due at least in part to normalization of the enzymatic
values to total protein content. real-time pcr values, on the
other hand, were normalized to total rna. liver is one of the
few tissues where cct␤ is not expressed at detectable levels
(fig. 2) (9), and so the reduction in cct activity, measured
using the same optimal conditions, from 0.466 ⫾ 0.034 in
wild-type liver to 0.198 ⫾ 0.026 pmol/min/␮g of protein (p ⬍
0.0001) in heterozygous liver was truly due to reduction in
cct␣ protein. on the other hand, the total cct activity in
brain did not decrease significantly (p ⫽ 0.07) in the  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺
mice, suggesting that the relatively high level of cct␤ expression in this organ (9) compensated for the loss of one active
cct␣ allele. livers from a total of three mice of each sex and
each genotype were included in the determination. there was
no difference between males and females within a genotype,
and so the values were combined and averaged.
liver did not express detectable levels of cct␤, and so we
determined whether the significant reduction of cct␣ protein
would alter the rate of ptdcho synthesis in primary hepatocytes isolated from heterozygous animals. hepatocytes were
isolated from  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ and  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ mice and incubated
with [3h]choline to estimate the rate of ptdcho synthesis in
vivo (fig. 3b). incorporation into ptdcho was linear from 2 to
6 h and, surprisingly, there was no statistical difference between the heterozygous livers and those from wild-type animals, i.e., 4.0 ⫻ 104 cpm versus 5.0 ⫻ 104 per 106 viable cells
after 6 h of incubation. the data certainly did not reflect the
approximate 50% difference in lysate specific activity noted
above (fig. 3a), but the results explained the lack of phenotypic distinction between heterozygous and wild-type animals.
there was no difference in the metabolic labeling results between the sexes, and thus the values are the averages of a total
of six independent determinations from each genotype, i.e.,
hepatocytes from three males and three females. these results
indicated that the amount of cct activity in wild-type cells was
more than sufficient to maintain physiological ptdcho production and that cct activity was biochemically regulated in cells
to maintain ptdcho synthesis at homeostatic levels. tissue
lipids were quantified in  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ and  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ mice and did
not exhibit a substantive change in ptdcho content in liver
(32.5 ⫾ 4.8 and 35.57 ⫾ 1.69 ␮g/mg [wet weight], respectively),
consistent with the metabolic labeling results. the highest rel-

expected, 100% of the homozygous mutant embryos failed to
form blastocysts. these results indicated that targeted disruption of both  xxxg1686xxx  alleles caused delayed or abnormal embryonic development prior to implantation. to determine whether
homozygous knockout embryos became implanted in the
uterus, we isolated day e8.5 embryos with surrounding yolk
sacs from pregnant  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ dams and found neither homozygous mutant embryos nor evidence of uterine resorption of
embryos. the data support the conclusion that  xxxg1686xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos did not develop successfully beyond the preimplantation
stage.
 xxxg1686xxx  gene expression is dominant at day e11.5. rna in
situ hybridization of frozen sagittal sections at day e11.5 of
murine gestation showed widespread expression of cct␣ encoded by the  xxxg1686xxx  gene throughout the mouse embryo (fig.
1a), and a particularly high level of cct␣ expression was
observed in the liver. there was more restricted expression of
cct␤ (fig. 1d) encoded by the  xxxg1687xxx  gene compared to that
of cct␣. cct␤2 and -␤3 expression could not be distinguished from each other using this technique, because the
optimum probe size necessitated that the 3⬘-untranslated portion of the transcripts be used to signal the ␣ and ␤ isoforms
and this region is identical for the ␤2 and ␤3 species.  xxxg1482xxx 
transcripts were also investigated, since this enzyme catalyzes a
reaction significant for ptdcho biosynthesis in liver (21) and
was found to be expressed at a very low level in e11.5 embryos
(fig. 1c). the negative control (background) showed no signal
on the tissue, whereas the  xxxg1482xxx  showed barely detectable
levels above background. using a different approach, quantitative real-time pcr showed that cct␣ transcripts in wildtype e11.5 embryos constituted 77%, whereas cct␤2 made up
approximately 11%, cct␤3 transcripts were 2%, and  xxxg1482xxx 
made up 10% of the four transcripts (fig. 1b). these data
support the in situ hybridization results, demonstrate that
 xxxg1686xxx  gene expression is dominant at day e11.5 in wild-type
embryos, and support a role for cct␣ expression during embryonic development beyond the blastocyst stage.
disruption of one  xxxg1686xxx  allele adjusts cct␤ and  xxxg1482xxx 
expression. the heterozygous  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ embryos and adult
mice did not exhibit an apparently different phenotype compared to wild-type littermate controls. therefore, we investigated the relative expression of the cct transcripts in day
e11.5 embryos (fig. 1d) as well as multiple adult tissues (fig.
2) by quantitative real-time pcr to determine if expression of
alternate genes compensated for the  xxxg1686xxx  reduced gene dosage. the value for cct␣ expression in the  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ embryos
was set at 1.0, and in the  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ embryos cct␣ was expressed at approximately 0.7 times the amount found in the
wild type. the expression of cct␤2, cct␤3, and  xxxg1482xxx  increased at least twofold in the heterozygous embryos in response to reduced cct␣ expression. on the other hand, reduction of cct␣ expression in  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ adult liver, lung,
heart, brain, or kidney did not elicit an increase in the expression of the alternative transcripts (fig. 2), suggesting that the
lower cct␣ expression in adult heterozygotes was sufficient
for maintaining ptdcho production via the cdp-choline pathway. the general distribution of transcripts in wild-type adult
animals was consistent with previously measured values (9).
cct␤2, cct␤3, and  xxxg1482xxx  transcripts were considerably
lower overall in the adult animals (fig. 2) compared to their

ative cct␣ expression was previously found in lung, where
cct␤ expression was roughly 40 times lower (9), and so we
examined if the ptdcho content of this organ was more sensitive to the reduction in cct␣ gene expression. there was a
small but significant reduction in the ptdcho content of
 xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ animals (19.18 ⫾ 2.54 in  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ compared to
23.19 ⫾ 1.74 ␮g/mg [wet weight] in  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹; p ⬍ 0.01), but
the other lipids, i.e., ptdetn, triglyceride, and cholesterol, did
not change.
discussion
deletion of cct␣ expression in mice revealed its essential
role in early embryonic development. the ability of the knockout preimplantation embryos to progress through the first few
cell divisions is likely due to the expression of maternal cct␤
that is present at high levels in mature ova (9). retarded
development of the cct␣-deficient embryos is seen at the
morula stage, indicating that cell division arrests at an earlier
stage. cct plays a central role in membrane ptdcho synthesis

(8) and, although embryonic cell size decreases during preimplantation development, there is an increase in total membrane surface area which requires the activity of cct␣ plus
cct␤. these data are consistent with observations in the liverspecific cct␣ knockout, where the organ contains fewer hepatocytes than control liver, suggesting that the hepatocytes lacking cct␣ do not produce enough ptdcho for normal cell
division (10). cct␣ expression dominates over cct␤ and
 xxxg1482xxx  expression during embryogenesis, and cct␣ is found
throughout the different cell types, with highest expression in
liver (fig. 1). these data are consistent with the very low level
of  xxxg1482xxx  activity observed in prenatal rat livers (5) and the
lack of detectable  xxxg1482xxx  pathway activity in e9.5 embryos with
impaired cct activity (7). although cct␣ is reduced in heterozygous embryos, the cct␤ isoforms and  xxxg1482xxx  expression
both are increased, and so it is difficult to judge whether the
level of cct␤ expression alone would be sufficient to support
the normal development that is observed.
in contrast to the essentiality of cct␣ in embryonic development, cct␣ expression is not critical for the function of

were removed from  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫹ and  xxxg1686xxx ⫹/⫺ mice. rna was isolated from liver, brain, heart, kidney, and lung of three mice of each gender

of target rna (2⫺⌬⌬ct) is normalized to the endogenous  xxxg861xxx  reference (⌬ct) and related to the amount of target cct␣ in liver from

some adult tissues. significant reduction of cct␣ in heterozygous adult liver does not invoke a compensatory increase in the
transcript levels of the cct␤ proteins or  xxxg1482xxx  (fig. 2), nor
is there a significant difference in the ptdcho mass compared
to that in wild type. despite a ⬎50% reduction in total cct
enzyme specific activity in heterozygous liver lysates, the metabolic activity of the cdp-choline pathway in isolated hepatocytes was the same as in wild-type hepatocytes (fig. 3). furthermore, it was reported previously that homozygous deletion
of cct␣ in liver does not have a severe phenotype, probably
because the  xxxg1482xxx  enzyme activity increases in response to
cct␣ deletion (10). the mild phenotype is found primarily in
female mice lacking liver cct␣ expression, which have reduced ptdcho and increased triglyceride content (10). in the
macrophage-specific cct␣ knockout, homozygous deletion of
cct␣ is accompanied by increased expression of cct␤,
whose activity is sufficient for macrophage development (24).
the phenotypic similarity between the heterozygous and wildtype adult mice in this report suggests that the amount of
cct␣ enzyme in wild-type liver is more than sufficient to
maintain ptdcho-associated functions. reduction of cct␣ expression in the lungs of heterozygous animals results in reduced ptdcho content, in contrast to the livers from the same
animals. cct␣ expression in wild-type lung is comparatively
the highest of those tissues examined thus far, with the exception of testis (9), and the lung is a very lipogenic organ, secreting large amounts of disaturated ptdcho as a major component of airway surfactant. taken together, these data suggest
that homozygous deletion of cct␣ expression in lung would
be very deleterious, and future investigation will determine
whether upregulation of cct␤ expression can compensate for
the lack of cct␣.
