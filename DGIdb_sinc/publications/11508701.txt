effect of exercise on the metabolism of  xxxd3049xxx  and some plp-dependent enzymes in young rats fed a restricted  xxxd3049xxx  diet.  the effect of exercise on  xxxd3049xxx  metabolism and plp-dependent enzymes was studied in rats fed a diet with or without  xxxd3049xxx . metabolism of some amino acids (citrulline, arginine, ornithine and threonine) inhibited in the b6-deficient rats was normalized during exercise. exercise was also effective in storing  xxxd3049xxx  in the body by lowering excretion of  xxxd3049xxx , when intake of  xxxd3049xxx  was restricted. aspartatae aminotransferase activity was higher in the red portion of the gastrocnemius muscle than that of the white one, whereas glycogen phosphorylase activity was vice versa and furthermore glycogen content in the white portion was very low in the  xxxd3049xxx -deficient rat. from the data obtained, it has been suggested that the red and white portions of the gastrocnemius muscle seemed to be more important in metabolizing amino acids and hydrolyze glycogen, respectively.
