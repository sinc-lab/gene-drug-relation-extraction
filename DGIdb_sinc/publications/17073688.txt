abstract: immunoglobulin e (ige) plays a central role in the development of allergic diseases. in sensitized individuals,
ige antibodies bind to receptors on mast cell and basophil surfaces, releasing preformed and newly generated mediators
that initiate an immunologic cascade and inflammatory symptoms.  xxxd2784xxx  (xolair®) is a humanized monoclonal
antibody designed to bind specifically to ige. it was approved by the united states food and drug administration in 2003
for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma that is inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen. in clinical trials in such
patients,  xxxd2784xxx  reduced the incidence of asthma exacerbations, severe exacerbations, the use of rescue medication,
and improved both symptoms and quality of life (qol).

introduction
in 1919, ramirez reported a case of asthma, caused by an
allergy to horse dander that was passively transferred by
blood transfusion from an allergic to a nonallergic individual
[1]. two years after this first known case of a transferable
substance mediating an allergic reaction, prausnitz and
küstner demonstrated transfer of humoral reactivity by injecting prausnitz with serum from küstner, who was allergic
to fish. an immediate wheal-and-flare reaction occurred
when fish antigen was injected into the sensitized area. the
factor in the serum that caused the transfer of allergy was
referred to as reagin [2]. in the mid 1960s, 2 independent
groups led by ishizaka and johannson identified reagin as
immunoglobulin e (ige), a novel class of serum antibody [36]. in 1968, the world health organization officially recognized ige [7].
similar to other immunoglobulins, ige is a 4-chain polypeptide composed of 2 identical heavy (epsilon) and 2 identical
light ( lambda or kappa) peptide chains. it is present at lower levels in
plasma than other immunoglobulins and has a shorter halflife. when exposed to allergen, plasma cells produce ige
under the control of the th-2 subset of cd4+ t helper cells
and the cytokines interleukin (il)-4 and il-13 [8].
ige receptors
ige binds via the constant fc region to specific highaffinity cell-surface receptors (fcepsilonri). fcepsilonri (fig. 1) is
composed of 4 polypeptides: an alpha-chain, a beta-chain, and a
pair of gamma chains that form an integral transmembrane complex. although it is the alpha-chain that binds ige, the beta- andgammachains are required for insertion of the alpha-chain into the
membrane and for signal transduction [9, 10]. the receptor

is primarily expressed on mast cell and basophil surfaces
[11]; it is also found on antigen-presenting cells such as cutaneous langerhans cells [12], dendritic cells [13], and
monocytes [14], as well as on eosinophils [15, 16], and
platelets [17]. fcepsilonri has a high affinity for ige (ka of 10 -9 to
10-10 m) [18], and the half-life of cell-bound ige on basophils is estimated  xxxd1891xxx  days [19].
antigen-specific ige, produced by plasma cells in response to exposure to an allergen, binds to fcepsilonri expressed
on the surfaces of tissue mast cells. allergen molecules reintroduced into the body bind to the protruding arms of the
surface-bound allergen-specific iges, cross-linking igereceptor complexes and activating the mast cell. representing type i hypersensitivity, this reaction releases preformed
and newly synthesized pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, including histamine, interleukins, leukotrienes, and
prostaglandins (fig. 2).
the presence of fcepsilonri on other cell types accounts for
additional pro-inflammatory activities. in patients with allergic diseases, fcepsilonri receptor expression is upregulated on
eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells
[20]. fcepsilonri expression on dendritic cells correlates with serum ige levels [21], appears to increase the efficiency of
antigen presentation, and augments the activation of allergen-specific th-2 subsets [13]. the low-affinity ige receptor, fcepsilonrii or cd23 (fig. 1), is present on many cell types
including b cells, t cells, monocytes, follicular dendritic
cells, langerhans cells, and eosinophils; its primary functions include regulation of ige production and antigen presentation [22]. when cd23 is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes, soluble cd23 has multiple cytokine-like functions on
b cell growth and differentiation, t cell growth, and ige
synthesis [22].

are low and rise steeply during the first year, continuing to
rise until they plateau by approximately age 5, and begin
decreasing after approximately age 70. the wide range of
adult ige levels makes it difficult to diagnose atopy by
measuring total serum ige. in addition, ige levels may be
elevated in other conditions, including parasitic infections,
human immunodeficiency virus infection, and wiskottaldrich syndrome.

positive test result to an allergen demonstrates ige sensitization, it does not prove that the allergen caused the symptoms;
however, detecting allergen-specific ige in serum has a
higher reproducibility than the skin test and is not influenced
by ongoing symptoms or treatment such as antihistamines. it
is also safe and eliminates the risk of anaphylaxis, which can
occur with skin-prick testing.
ige and allergic disease

skin test for allergy
skin tests can demonstrate ige sensitization. drops of
allergen solution, chosen on the basis of the patient’s clinical
history and the physician’s knowledge of common allergens
in the region, are placed on the skin (usually the forearm).
the skin is pricked with needles to introduce the allergens
into the dermis. the presence of a raised wheal ≥3 mm in
diameter indicates ige-mediated sensitivity to the allergen(s). results are interpreted by comparing to positive
(histamine) and negative (saline) controls.
serum allergen-specific ige tests
in serum allergen-specific ige tests, allergens are adsorbed on paper discs or polyurethane caps (cap) and exposed to an individual’s serum. the presence of allergenspecific ige is detected by using an enzyme-linked antihuman ige antibody in a colorimetric reaction. although a

there is a correlation between serum ige levels and
asthma, and ige-mediated inflammation is critical in the
pathophysiology of asthma. in showing a correlation between asthma rates, skin-prick test positivity, and serum ige
levels, burrows and colleagues concluded that “asthma is
almost always associated with some type of ige-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis” [24]. sears [25]
investigated the relationship between serum total ige levels
and airway hyperresponsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  in children
and found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness was linked to a higher serum ige
level. although many other studies also have demonstrated a
relationship between asthma and sensitization to allergens
[26-28], the association between high serum ige levels and
allergic rhinitis is unclear. burrows and colleagues observed
that allergic rhinitis is associated with reactivity to skin tests
independent of total serum ige levels [24].

ige, allergic diseases, and  xxxd2784xxx 

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30 3931

in atopic individuals, initial exposure to an allergen results in sensitization. the allergen is processed and presented to th2-cells by antigen-presenting cells.
these th2-cells release mediators that activate b cells to produce antigen-specific ige. upon re-exposure to the same allergen, an acute response is triggered
through cross-linking of antibody-loaded high-affinity ige receptors on mast cells and basophils.

fig. (2). allergic sensitization and mechanism of response to subsequent exposure to allergen.

there is considerable overlap between total ige levels in
atopic and nonatopic individuals; between 35% and 50% of
people with allergic rhinitis have normal total ige levels,
whereas up to 20% of nonatopic individuals have elevated
total ige levels [29]. for this reason, detecting allergenspecific ige antibodies by skin or in vitro testing is a better
indicator of allergic rhinitis than the serum total ige level,
with the added benefit of identifying the allergen to which
the patient is sensitive.
ige and pathophysiology
in an allergic immune response, allergen-specific b cells
are stimulated by cytokines il-4 and il-13 to produce ige
antibodies. cross-linking of cell-surface ige-receptor complexes on inflammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils stimulates the release of preformed and newly generated mediators of inflammation, including histamine, tryptase,  xxxd14xxx , and leukotriene c 4. the inflammatory
mediators released when ige-coated mast cells are activated
by allergen molecules cause multiple effects on bronchial
and vascular smooth muscle and on the mucosal microvasculature. these immediate effects, which constitute the allergen-induced early-phase asthmatic response, include bronchoconstriction, edema, increased mucous production, and
airway hyperresponsiveness. the result is narrowing of the
airways and the characteristic asthmatic airflow obstruction.

more than 30 years ago, pepys showed that when sensitized individuals inhale specific allergens, early reactivity
promotes bronchoconstriction that occurs in 5 to 15 minutes
and lasts up to 1 hour. in addition, a late response can occur
within 2 to 6 hours and last up to 24 hours. the late-phase
asthmatic response is accompanied by increased bronchial
hyperresponsiveness to stimuli such as inhaled histamine and
 xxxd2586xxx  [30]. during the late-phase asthmatic response,
neutrophil and eosinophil chemoattractants are released in
the airway and recruit additional inflammatory cells, activating them to secrete inflammatory mediators such as major
basic protein,  xxxg1965xxx , leukotrienes, and
 xxxd2973xxx . these mediators damage respiratory epithelial cells and provoke bronchoconstriction and
airway edema.
unmet needs in ige-mediated disease management
asthma morbidity and mortality
in the national health interview survey, conducted in
the united states in 2002, 30.8 million responders reported
being diagnosed with asthma, and 20 million people had
asthma at the time of the interview [31]. between 1980 and
1996, the self-reported 12-month prevalence of asthma increased 74%. in 1996, an estimated 14.6 million people in
the united states reported having asthma [32].

3932

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30

in the 2002 national health interview survey, asthma
rates were greater in adults than children; with ≥14 million
adults and 6.1 million children aged 0 to 17 years having
asthma at the time of the interview. women had a 30%
higher prevalence compared with men; however, this pattern
was reversed in children, with the prevalence rate for boys
>30% higher than the rate among girls. the number of
deaths from asthma in the united states gradually increased
from 1980 to 1995. mortality rates, however, may recently
have begun to plateau. for example, in 1995, asthma accounted for 5637 deaths [32]. in 2002, this figure dropped to
4261 [31].
the epidemiology and natural history of asthma: outcomes and treatment regimens study (tenor)
although patients with severe asthma may not constitute
the majority of the asthma population, they are the most
challenging to manage and are associated with the highest
costs and morbidity. a prospective study in 2001 was initiated to collect data over 3 years on patients with severe or
difficult-to-treat asthma [33]. the epidemiology and natural
history of asthma: outcomes and treatment regimens
(tenor) study collected data on the natural history of
asthma, the relationship between asthma treatments and outcomes, lung function testing, the frequency of predefined
comorbid conditions, and the relationship between ige levels
and disease.
more than 400 us pulmonologists and allergists enrolled
4756 patients ≥6 years of age in the study. patients were eligible for inclusion in this study if they had been diagnosed
with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma by their physician; if
they had received care from their physician or health care
provider for at least 1 year; had a smoking history of ≤30
pack-years, and had either high use of the health care system
or high medication use in the previous 12 months [33]. during the 3-year study period, patients had 7 study visits and
completed questionnaires assessing health care coverage,
characteristics of asthma, medical history, comorbid medical
conditions, and self-reported allergen exposure. the results
of the study demonstrated a common lack of disease control
in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. hospitalizations,
emergency department visits, history of intubation, and use
of steroid bursts were consistently high in all age groups,
with higher than expected health care utilization and missed
work or schooldays in patients with the most severe disease.
cost of asthma
costs incurred with asthma include direct health care
costs (medication, visits to the emergency department, outpatient care, and hospitalizations) and indirect health care
costs (loss of productivity and absence from work or school).
the annual direct health care cost of asthma in the united
states is approximately $11.5 billion, with $4.6 billion in
indirect costs including lost productivity, for a total of $16.1
billion [34]. in a recent study of 401 adults with selfassessed asthma severity, the average total per-person annual
cost for asthma was approximately $5000 [35]. the largest
direct costs were drugs (50%), hospital admissions (15%),
and nonemergency room visits (11%). the largest indirect
costs were cessation of work (61%) and loss of entire work-

l.m. dubuske

days (28%). the total cost for a person with severe asthma
was almost 5 times the cost of mild asthma. a substantial
portion of the high costs of asthma may be attributable to
uncontrolled disease [36]. although patients with severe or
difficult-to-treat asthma represent only a small portion of the
total asthma population, they appear to account for much of
the morbidity, mortality, and cost of the disease.
health-related quality of life (qol) measures indicate
that people with asthma tend to have poorer qol than those
without the condition [37]. studies also indicate that patients
with poorer qol questionnaire scores have higher asthmarelated health care utilization and costs [38, 39].
asthma disease management guidelines
in addition to maintaining near-normal pulmonary function and activity, the goals for successful asthma management are minimizing symptoms, exacerbations, rescue medication use, and adverse effects from asthma medications
[40]. according to the global initiative for asthma (gina)
guidelines [40], successful asthma management requires
interrelated features: patient education; severity assessment
and monitoring; avoiding risk factors (triggers); establishing
individualized long-term treatment plans (including plans for
exacerbation management); and providing regular follow-up
care.
gina and the national asthma education and prevention program (naepp) [41, 42] guidelines recommend a
stepwise approach to long-term management of asthma. selection of asthma therapy is informed by disease severity, the
patient’s current treatment, properties and availability of
medication, and economic considerations. when asthma
control is maintained for 3 months, therapy is reduced to the
minimum required to maintain control.
despite the availability of clear recommendations and
guidelines, inadequate management of asthma continues to
contribute to asthma-related morbidity and mortality. in a
recent european survey of 2803 people with asthma, only
5.3% met all goals according to the gina guidelines [43].
there were high rates of unscheduled urgent care visits
(25%), emergency department visits (10%), and hospitalizations due to asthma (7%).
poor adherence to prescribed treatment regimens, including inhaled corticosteroids (ics), is an important contributing factor in poor asthma control. patients must be educated to understand the importance of taking their prescribed
medications regularly even when they are feeling well rather
than waiting until their pulmonary function deteriorates. one
study of 85 adults with moderate or severe persistent asthma
reported that poorer adherence was associated with lower
educational achievement (p=0.01), lower household income
(p=0.002), and more baseline symptoms (p=0.003) [44].
poor adherence is particularly prevalent among the poor and
underprivileged [45].
allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis is estimated to affect 20 to 40 million
people in the united states annually, including 10% to 30%
of adults and up to 40% of children [29]. the prevalence of
allergic rhinitis has increased in developed countries in re-

ige, allergic diseases, and  xxxd2784xxx 

cent decades: in 1 swedish study between 1971 and 1981,
the prevalence increased from 4.4% to 8.4% (p<0.001) [46].
the cost of treating allergic rhinitis and the indirect costs
related to loss of workplace productivity are considerable. in
1995, the estimated cost was $2.7 billion, excluding costs
related to associated medical problems such as sinusitis and
asthma [29]. rhinitis also results in an estimated 2 million
missed school days annually [29].
comorbidities of allergic rhinitis
comorbid conditions commonly associated with allergic
rhinitis include asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media (om).
the majority of patients with asthma have seasonal or
perennial allergic rhinitis [47] the results of 1 study demonstrated a strong association between asthma and perennial
rhinitis among atopic subjects (odds ratio=8.1; 95% confidence interval=5.4 to 12.1) and among nonatopic subjects
(odds ratio=11.6; 95% confidence interval=6.2 to 21.9) [48].
adults with a family history of asthma or rhinitis have a 3- to
4-fold higher risk of developing asthma and a 2- to 6-fold
higher risk of developing allergic rhinitis compared with
adults with no relevant family history [49].
clinical evidence suggests that the treatment of allergic
rhinitis can improve co-existing asthma. for example, nasal
beclomethasone prevents a seasonal increase in bronchial
hyperresponsiveness in patients with allergic rhinitis and
asthma [50]. although systemic absorption of nasal corticosteroids is minimal, nasal corticosteroids and nasal  xxxd1763xxx  have been shown to prevent seasonal asthma worsening [51].
sinusitis is one of the most commonly reported chronic
diseases in the united states, affecting more than 30 million
individuals [52]. sinusitis is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis; 60% of patients with par have x-ray evidence
of sinus disease. patients with sinusitis are generally treated
with antibiotics and may require surgical intervention [29].
medical treatment for sinusitis is expensive, with an estimated $5 billion spent annually and additional billions of
dollars spent on surgical treatment each year [52].
om is common in children: 50% of children will have an
episode before their first birthday and 80% of children will
have an episode before their third birthday [53]. an estimated $3 to $4 billion is spent annually on care of patients
with acute om and related complications [53]. in addition,
caregivers for children with om typically miss 2 workdays
per episode due to the need for the affected child to remain at
home, adding to lost productivity costs [54]. although the
mechanisms linking allergic rhinitis and om are undefined,
several studies correlate allergic reactions with om [55, 56].
allergic rhinitis treatment guidelines
allergic rhinitis may precede the onset of asthma symptoms, and when the 2 conditions coexist, asthma may not be
optimally controlled without effective management of the
allergic rhinitis. this reflects the common underlying igemediated pathophysiology in the upper and lower airways. in
1999, the world health organization investigated the association between asthma and allergic rhinitis. based on this

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30 3933

investigation, the allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma
(aria) guidelines were developed [47]. to reduce confusion based on the previous classification of allergic rhinitis,
the aria guidelines proposed reclassifying rhinitis as intermittent or persistent instead of seasonal or perennial. disease severity is now classified as mild, moderate, or severe
based on symptoms and qol. the guidelines emphasize that
asthma and allergic rhinitis are common comorbidities that
require comprehensive evaluation and an integrated strategy
for treating upper and lower airway disease.
food allergy
food allergies with acute symptom onset after eating are
usually ige-mediated; subacute or chronic food hypersensitivity is primarily mediated by t cells [57]. ige-dependent
food allergies may affect 1 or more target organs, including
skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system, while subacute and chronic food allergies tend
to affect the gastrointestinal tract or skin [58, 59].
allergen avoidance is the best way to reduce symptoms.
when exposure does occur, antihistamines may be used to
relieve itching or rash; anaphylaxis requires immediate
treatment with epinephrine and supportive care. food allergies seldom cause isolated respiratory symptoms.
 xxxd2784xxx  development—preclinical
monoclonal antibodies developed against human ige
have provided a novel approach to treating allergic disease.
in 1990, chang and colleagues [60] produced a murine antihuman ige antibody. murine monoclonal antibodies, however, are highly antigenic to humans and can stimulate production of human anti-mouse antibodies. in 1993, presta [61]
reported the humanization of a murine monoclonal antibody
(mae11) specific for human ige. sequenced and cloned at
genentech, mae11 was produced by immunizing mice with
human ige. the technique for humanizing mae11 involved
transplanting antigen-binding loops, the complementaritydetermining regions from mae11, onto a human igg1 antibody. binding comparable to that of the original murine antibody was achieved by modifying 5 amino acid residues.
this humanized monoclonal antibody,  xxxd2784xxx  (formerly  xxxd328xxx e25; xolair®), contains only 5% murine
residues, most of which are hidden from the immune system
when the antibody binds to ige.
preclinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
 xxxd2784xxx  forms immune complexes with free ige. it
binds to the same ige fcepsilon3 domain that binds to fcepsilonri [62].
therefore,  xxxd2784xxx  can bind to free ige but not to an ige
molecule that is bound to a cell-surface receptor or directly
to the cell-surface receptor. as a result,  xxxd2784xxx  cannot
cross-link bound ige molecules and induce mast cell activation.
in vitro analysis shows that the circulating omalizumabige immune complexes are small, typically being trimers or
hexamers, and slowly clear from the serum.  xxxd2784xxx  is
largely distributed in the blood and serum compartment. the
lack of specific tissue uptake and slow clearance of the complexes is consistent with the low-avidity interaction of small

3934

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30

immune complexes with fcgamma receptors of leukocytes and the
reticuloendothelial system. characteristic of igg antibodies,
the half-life of  xxxd2784xxx  is approximately 26 days.
the ability of  xxxd2784xxx  to block ige binding to human
lung mast cells was assessed using strips of normal human
lung tissue sensitized to ige by overnight incubation in a
solution containing serum from ragweed-allergic subjects in
the presence or absence of  xxxd2784xxx  [63]. adding ragweed antigen in the absence of  xxxd2784xxx  caused histamine release and tissue contraction consistent with a bronchoconstrictor response. histamine release and tissue contraction were not observed when tissue was incubated in the
presence of  xxxd2784xxx .
preclinical safety
 xxxd2784xxx  was safe and well tolerated in toxicologic
studies in cynomolgus monkeys treated with high doses, and
there was no evidence of immune complex disease following
administration of  xxxd2784xxx . neither the  xxxd2784xxx -ige
complex nor free  xxxd2784xxx  binds complement factor c1q
or generates factor  xxxg282xxx  [64], and neither mediates complement-dependent cytotoxicity. in addition, there was no evidence of renal toxicity or a systemic anaphylactic response.
 xxxd2784xxx  in clinical development
downregulation of ige receptors
 xxxd2784xxx  downregulates fc_ri expression on basophils. macglashan and colleagues [65] studied subjects with
elevated ige levels and par who were given intravenous
 xxxd2784xxx  for 3 months. at the end of treatment, average
ige receptor numbers were reduced from approximately 220,
000 to approximately 8300 receptors per cell. in addition, the
responsiveness of basophils to stimulation with allergen
(dust mite) decreased by approximately 90%. a decrease in
responsiveness of skin mast cells also was observed with a
100-fold increase in the amount of antigen required to produce a skin test response equal to that seen before  xxxd2784xxx  treatment. therefore, the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2784xxx  appears to be associated with a combination of reduced
free ige levels and ige receptor downregulation.
inhibiting allergen-induced early and late asthmatic
responses
the early asthmatic response to allergen was significantly reduced during  xxxd2784xxx  therapy in a study of 19
patients with mild asthma and a positive skin test to a common aeroallergen [66]. a 2.7-fold increase in allergen concentration was required to produce a 15% decrease in fev1
on day 77. this change is similar to that produced by antiinflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. in a
second study of 18 subjects with mild asthma and a positive
skin test to a common aeroallergen,  xxxd2784xxx  treatment
significantly inhibited the early and late asthmatic responses.
the early decline in fev 1 decreased from 30% at baseline to
19% at the end of treatment, and the late decline in fev1
decreased from 24% at baseline to 9% at the end of treatment
[67].
exhaled  xxxd2738xxx  (no) has been investigated as a
marker of inflammatory activity in the airway. silkoff and

l.m. dubuske

colleagues [68] measured no levels in a subgroup of 29
children with asthma participating in a phase 3 study [69].
despite a substantial reduction in inhaled corticosteroid
doses while receiving  xxxd2784xxx  therapy, a significant decrease in exhaled no levels was detected in children in the
 xxxd2784xxx  group compared with an increase in exhaled no
in the placebo group.
clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
 xxxd2784xxx  is absorbed slowly following subcutaneous
administration, reaching peak serum concentrations within 7
to 8 days via linear pharmacokinetics. the volume of distribution is similar to plasma volume, indicating there is little
or no accumulation in peripheral tissue. the terminal halflife of  xxxd2784xxx  is approximately 26 days and the clearance rates averaged 2.4 ± 1.1 ml/kg/d. no dose adjustments
are necessary for people aged 12 to 76 years, regardless of
race, ethnicity, or gender. following subcutaneous dosing,
free ige levels are rapidly reduced in a dose-dependent manner after administering  xxxd2784xxx . sixteen weeks after the
first dose, serum total ige levels increase approximately 5fold, due to the presence of  xxxd2784xxx -ige immune complexes in the blood; the total ige assay measures ige that is
bound in complexes and therefore inactive [70].
 xxxd2784xxx  dosing strategy
preliminary clinical evidence suggested that the clinical
benefit of  xxxd2784xxx  is most pronounced when free ige
levels are reduced to <40 ng/ml [66, 71]. the relationship
between free ige levels and clinical efficacy also was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled study of  xxxd2784xxx  in
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (sar) [72], in which
clinical efficacy was greatest in patients whose free ige levels were reduced to <25 ng/ml. to achieve such levels,
 xxxd2784xxx  has to be given at a molar excess of 10:1 to 15:1
relative to the baseline ige level which causes accumulation
of ige, as the half life of free ige is 1-2 days, whereas the
half life of  xxxd2784xxx -bound ige is 26 days. [71].
in a pooled analysis of 2 studies involving a total of 859
asthma patients, administration of the minimum dose calculated to achieve a free ige level of 25 ng/ml resulted in free
ige levels of <50 ng/ml in more than 95% of patients [73].
based on these results, and the fact that body weight also
affects the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2784xxx , dosing tables
(tables 1 and 2) were developed according to which patients
receive 150 mg to 375 mg of  xxxd2784xxx  via subcutaneous
injection every 2 or 4 weeks [70].
patients requiring a dose <300 mg of  xxxd2784xxx  are
treated once every 4 weeks, while those requiring higher
monthly doses (450 mg to 750 mg) are given 2 divided doses
every 2 weeks. individual doses >150 mg are divided and
administered at more than 1 injection site. this dosing protocol was used in the large phase 3 clinical studies, which
achieved median serum-free ige levels below the target of
25 ng/ml [73].
clinical trials of  xxxd2784xxx 
in the first 3 large-scale phase 3 studies, significant clinical benefits were reported in adults (studies 008 and 009)

xolair® doses (milligrams) administered by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with asthma (xolair® prescribing information, genentech inc. and novartis pharmaceutical corp. 2003).

[74, 75] and children (study 010) [69] with moderate-tosevere persistent asthma inadequately controlled with ics
and a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial
aeroallergen. all were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
in which patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous
injections of  xxxd2784xxx  or placebo every 2 or 4 weeks
based on the dosing schedule shown in tables 1 and 2. each
patient had a diagnosis of asthma for at least 1 year, baseline
serum ige levels within the specified range (30 iu/ml to
700 iu/ml in adults and 30 iu/ml to 1300 iu/ml in children), and reactivity to at least 1 common allergen. patients
in all 3 studies had to have stable asthma, defined as no significant change in their regular asthma medication and no
acute asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid rescue
for at least 1 month prior to enrollment.
during the run-in period, patients were switched from
their previous ics to an equivalent dose of beclomethasone
dipropionate (bdp). patients then received  xxxd2784xxx  or

placebo and a stable dose of bdp for 16 weeks (the steroidstable phase). in the following 12 weeks (the steroidreduction phase), attempts were made to gradually reduce or
withdraw bdp. over the subsequent 28 weeks (extension
phase), patients continued their study medication ( xxxd2784xxx  or placebo) and were encouraged to maintain their reduced corticosteroid doses or remain steroid-free if the bdp
had been eliminated during the steroid-reduction phase [76,
77]. in the children’s study, the extension phase was openlabel, with all patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx  [78].
outcomes in adult studies (008 and 009)
study 008 [74] involved 525 randomized adult and adolescent patients aged 12 to 75 years ( xxxd2784xxx  group:
n=268; placebo group: n=257). study 009 [75] involved 546
randomized adult and adolescent patients aged 12 to 75
( xxxd2784xxx  group: n=274; placebo group: n=272). patients

bdp and as-needed rescue medication such as a short-acting
bronchodilator.

during the 28-week extension phases, patients receiving
 xxxd2784xxx  continued to have fewer asthma exacerbations
than placebo-treated patients, and fewer  xxxd2784xxx  patients
had 1 or more asthma exacerbations (table 3), even with
their lowered or eliminated ics therapy [76, 77]. in both
studies, treatment with  xxxd2784xxx  was well tolerated and
the incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups.

during the steroid-stable phases in both studies, the incidence of asthma exacerbations and the proportion of patients
with at least 1 asthma exacerbation were significantly reduced in the  xxxd2784xxx -treated group compared with the
placebo group (table 3). during the steroid-reduction phase,
the reduction in bdp dose required for asthma control was
significantly greater in the  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients than
in patients receiving placebo (study 008: 75% reduction vs
50% reduction, p<0.001; study 009: median dose at end of
steroid reduction phase was 100 µg vs 300 µg; p< 0.001).
complete withdrawal of bdp was achieved in a greater
number of  xxxd2784xxx -treated than placebo-treated patients
(in study 008: 39.6% vs 19.1%, p<0.001; in study 009: 43%
vs 19%). despite the reduced or eliminated ics doses, the
incidence of exacerbations and the proportion of patients
with at least 1 asthma exacerbation continued to be significantly lower in the  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients (table 3).

outcomes in the children’s study (010)
study 010 involved 334 children aged 6 to 12 years
( xxxd2784xxx  group, n=225; placebo group, n=109) with
well-controlled moderate or severe asthma. bdp was withdrawn completely in 55% of patients in the  xxxd2784xxx 
group versus 39% of placebo patients (p=0.004). during the
steroid-stable phase, 15.6% of  xxxd2784xxx  patients had an
exacerbation episode compared with 22.9% of placebo patients (p=0.095). during the steroid-reduction phase, significantly fewer patients treated with  xxxd2784xxx  experienced
an exacerbation compared with placebo (18.2% with  xxxd2784xxx  vs 38.5% with placebo, p<0.001). there was also
evidence of less need for rescue medication in patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx ; at the end of the steroid-reduction
phase, the median number of puffs of rescue medication
taken daily was 0 in the  xxxd2784xxx  group and 0.46 in the
placebo group. this change from baseline was significant in
favor of  xxxd2784xxx  (p=0.004).

patients completed the asthma quality of life questionnaire (aqlq) at baseline and at the end of the steroid-stable
and steroid-reduction phases. both  xxxd2784xxx - and placebo-treated patients experienced clinically meaningful improvements (>0.5 points from baseline) in the aqlq score.
 xxxd2784xxx -treated patients had significantly greater improvements versus placebo in overall scores at the end of the
steroid-stable phase (study 008: mean change from baseline
was 0.93 with  xxxd2784xxx  and 0.66 with placebo, p<0.01;
study 009, p<0.001) and at the end of the steroid-reduction
phase (study 008: mean change from baseline was 0.97 with
 xxxd2784xxx  and 0.7 with placebo, p< 0.01, study 009:
p<0.001) and for each domain (including activities, emotions, symptoms, and environmental exposure) [79, 80].

table 3.

there was no significant difference between treatment
groups in juniper pediatric aqlq scores at the end of the
steroid-stable phase; however, at the end of the steroidreduction phase, improvement in qol from baseline was
significantly greater in the  xxxd2784xxx  group than in the
placebo group for activities and symptom domains, and

overall scores (p<0.05). in addition, the proportion of patients achieving clinically important improvements at the end
of the study was greater in the  xxxd2784xxx  group than in the
placebo group; these differences reached levels of significance in the activities domain scores and overall scores
(p<0.05) [81].
during the 24-week extension phase, all patients received
open-label  xxxd2784xxx  [78], which was safe and well tolerated. the incidence of adverse events (aes) for patients
treated with  xxxd2784xxx  for 1 year (n=225) was similar to
aes in patients treated for 28 weeks in the core trial (92.9%
vs 89.3% of patients with an ae), which also was generally
comparable to the ae rate in the placebo group (87.2% of
patients with an adverse event). during 52 weeks of treatment, upper respiratory tract infection (47.1% of patients)
and headache (42.7% of patients) were the most frequently
reported aes.
effect of  xxxd2784xxx  in patients with mild-tomoderate asthma
a small phase 3 trial (study 0112) in adult patients with
persistent asthma demonstrated that  xxxd2784xxx  significantly decreased airway inflammation [82]. patients were
between 19 and 48 years of age and had stable, mild-tomoderate asthma for at least 1 year; baseline serum ige levels within a specified range (≥30 to ≤700 iu/ml); skin reactivity to at least 1 common allergen; airway hyperresponsiveness as defined by a  xxxd2586xxx  pc20 value of <8
mg/ml; and sputum eosinophils of ≥2% of total nonsquamous cells.
study 0112 was a 4-month, multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in
which 45 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or
 xxxd2784xxx  (150 mg to 300 mg every 4 weeks or 225 mg to
375 mg every 2 weeks) based upon concentration of serum
ige and body weight ( xxxd2784xxx  group: n=22; placebo
group: n=23). outcomes included inflammatory cells in induced sputum and bronchial biopsies, and  xxxd2586xxx  responsiveness [82].
a total of 43 patients completed the full protocol ( xxxd2784xxx , n=21; placebo, n=22). the mean percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum was significantly reduced in the
 xxxd2784xxx  group (6.6 to 1.7%, p<0.001) but was not significantly reduced in the placebo group (8.5 to 7.0%). the
between-group difference was significant (p=0.05). the significant decrease in sputum eosinophils in the omalizumabtreated group was mirrored by a significant decrease in eosinophil levels in tissue biopsies. the median eosinophil
counts in the submucosa of  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients decreased from 8.0 (1.9 to 21.7) cells/mm2 to 1.5 (0 to 20)
cells/mm2 (p<0.001) compared with a nonsignificant placebo-induced decrease from 6.3 (0.3 to 71) cells/mm2 to 6.4
(0.7 to 69.8) cells/mm2 [82].
all  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients had a free ige concentration <50 ng/ml (21 iu/ml) at study end, whereas no
subjects in the placebo group had free ige concentrations
below this level. there were no significant between-group
changes in airway responsiveness by 16 weeks. the lack of

gests that ige or eosinophils may not be causally linked to
airway hyperresponsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  in mild-tomoderate asthma or that the study was too short in duration
to determine the physiologic impact on airway reactivity of
the pathologic reduction in airway inflammatory parameters
which was seen [82].
effect of  xxxd2784xxx  on serious asthma exacerbations
bousquet and colleagues [83] performed a pooled analysis of 7 studies to assess the effects of  xxxd2784xxx  on
asthma exacerbations in patients with severe persistent
asthma: 5 were randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies in which patients received subcutaneous
injections of  xxxd2784xxx  or placebo [74, 75, 84-86]; 2 were
randomized and controlled but open-label [87; asthma subjects already treated with other therapies [alto] unpublished data). in all studies,  xxxd2784xxx  was given as
add-on therapy to concomitant asthma treatment [83]. definitions of asthma exacerbations included: a worsening of
asthma requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids [84,
86, 87]; a worsening of asthma requiring treatment with
systemic corticosteroids or a doubling of the baseline ics
dose [74, 75, 85]; a worsening of asthma requiring unscheduled medical care or emergency room visit or hospitalization,
and 1 or more of the following: doubling of ics dose, increase in dose of oral corticosteroids, or initiation of systemic corticosteroids (alto study, unpublished data). absolute differences in annualized exacerbation rates were calculated to enable comparison of results from studies of different duration.
the 7 studies included 4308 patients ( xxxd2784xxx : 2511;
control: 1797), 93% of whom had severe persistent asthma
according to gina guidelines [41]. pooled data showed that
 xxxd2784xxx  significantly reduced the annualized rate of
asthma exacerbations by 38% compared with control (0.910
and 1.474 respectively, p<0.0001) and the annualized rate of
total emergency visits by 47% (0.332 and 0.623 respectively,
p<0.0001).  xxxd2784xxx  reduced hospital admissions by
52% (p=0.041), emergency room visits by 61% (p=0.013)
and unscheduled doctor visits by 47% (p=0.0003) compared
with the control group. the pooled population data for emergency visits did not include the study by vignola and colleagues (2004) as these data were not collected in this study.
analysis of demographic subgroups indicated that the effect
of  xxxd2784xxx  on asthma exacerbations was unaffected by
patient age, gender, baseline ige, or by 2- versus 4-weekly
dosing schedule; however, the benefit in absolute terms appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe asthma.
factors associated with a response to  xxxd2784xxx 
therapy
bousquet and colleagues [88] analyzed pooled data from
the 16-week steroid-stable phases of the core phase 3 trials
[74, 75] to identify patient characteristics that might predict a
response to  xxxd2784xxx  therapy. a history of emergency
asthma treatment in the previous year was the most predictive of best response to  xxxd2784xxx  (p=0.015). response
rates were 67% for  xxxd2784xxx  and 42% for placebo for
patients with such a history; for those without this history,
response rates were 63% and 54% respectively. high bdp

3938

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30

dose was another predictor of best response to  xxxd2784xxx 
(p=0.037). response rates for those treated with ≥800 µg/d
were 65% for  xxxd2784xxx  and 40% for placebo; for those
treated with <800 µg/d, the response rates were 63% and
55% respectively. a low fev1 was also predictive of responsiveness to  xxxd2784xxx  (p=0.072). response rates for
those with fev1 ≤65% were 60% for  xxxd2784xxx  and 40%
for placebo; response rates for those with fev1 ≥65% were
67% and 53% respectively. patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx 
could be classified as responders after 4 weeks of treatment.
sixty-one percent of those who responded by 16 weeks had
already responded by 4 weeks; 87% showed evidence of a
response by week 12.
this finding is consistent with the results of a metaanalysis of data from 3 trials of  xxxd2784xxx  therapy in patients with moderate or severe ige-mediated asthma in which
 xxxd2784xxx  treatment halved the exacerbation rate in a subgroup of high-risk patients [89]. high-risk patients were
those who had prior intubation, visited an emergency department, experienced an overnight hospitalization, or had
treatment in an intensive care unit within the previous year.
poorly controlled or severe asthma
patients with poorly controlled or severe asthma represent only a small proportion of asthma patients but account
for much of the morbidity, mortality, and cost of the disease.
an open-label 1-year randomized study was conducted to
evaluate  xxxd2784xxx  treatment in addition to and compared
with best standard care (bsc), as defined by national heart,
lung and blood institute guidelines [41], in 312 adolescent
and adult patients (aged 12 to 73 years) with moderate-tosevere poorly controlled asthma [87]. the results showed
that  xxxd2784xxx  treatment significantly reduced the annual
mean number of asthma deterioration-related incidents from
9.76 with bsc alone (n=106) to 4.92 with bsc plus  xxxd2784xxx  (n=206; p<0.001), and reduced the incidence of
asthma exacerbations from 2.86 per patient year with bsc
alone to 1.12 per patient-year with bsc plus  xxxd2784xxx 
(p<0.001).  xxxd2784xxx  also improved fev1 compared with
bsc alone (2.48 and 2.28 respectively, p<0.05), reduced the
use of rescue medication (0.60 puffs per day bronchodilator
vs 3.00 puffs per day with bsc alone, p<0.001), and reduced
symptom scores relative to bsc alone (decrease of 6.5 and
0.7 respectively, p<0.001). in addition, patients treated with
 xxxd2784xxx  experienced a reduction in the mean daily dose
of ics by study end relative to baseline compared to bsc
alone (-342 µg/day and +68 µg/day respectively; p<0.001).
treatment was well tolerated, with comparable ae rates in
both treatment groups.
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 32week study of  xxxd2784xxx  therapy in 246 adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 to 75 years) with severe asthma and
positive skin tests to aeroallergens [86] ( xxxd2784xxx  group;
n=126; placebo group; n=120), patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx  achieved a greater reduction in fluticasone dose than
patients receiving placebo (mean reduction 57.2% vs 43.3%;
p=0.003). seventy-four percent of patients in the  xxxd2784xxx  group reduced their fluticasone dose by at least 50%
compared with 51% of patients in the placebo group
(p=0.001). despite the significant reduction in ics dose,

l.m. dubuske

there was no loss of control on  xxxd2784xxx  and 35% to 45%
of patients experienced lower exacerbation rates than patients treated with placebo. treatment with  xxxd2784xxx  led
to a significant decrease in the use of rescue medications
throughout the study (p<0.01 at week 32). asthma-related
qol also improved with  xxxd2784xxx  therapy: 58% of
 xxxd2784xxx -treated patients experienced clinically detectable improvements in qol scores compared with 39% of
patients receiving placebo (p<0.01).
 xxxd2784xxx  was evaluated as an add-on therapy in 419
adolescents and adults (aged 12 to 75 years) with severe persistent asthma, inadequately controlled despite best available
therapy [84]. this was a phase 3, 28-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group
study ( xxxd2784xxx : n=209; placebo: n=210). the clinically
significant asthma exacerbation rate (primary efficacy variable), adjusted for imbalances in the history of clinically
significant asthma exacerbations, was 0.68 for  xxxd2784xxx 
and 0.91 for placebo (26% reduction) during the treatment
phase (p=0.042).  xxxd2784xxx  significantly reduced the severe asthma exacerbation rate (0.24 vs 0.48, p=0.002) and
emergency visit rate (0.24 vs 0.43, p=0.038). asthma-related
qol improved significantly in response to  xxxd2784xxx 
therapy, with a significantly greater proportion of patients
receiving  xxxd2784xxx  achieving a clinically meaningful
(≥0.5 point) improvement from baseline compared with placebo (60.8% vs 47.8%, p=0.008).  xxxd2784xxx  add-on therapy also improved morning peak expiratory flow (pef)
(p=0.042), fev 1 (p=0.043) and total asthma symptom score
(p=0.039) compared with placebo. while the use of rescue
medication decreased with patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx ,
the between-group difference did not reach levels of significance.
allergic rhinitis
 xxxd2784xxx  has been evaluated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with sar [72, 90, 91].
patients received a fixed dose of  xxxd2784xxx  every 3 or 4
weeks depending on the patient’s baseline ige level. the
first study was a double-blind, dose-ranging, placebocontrolled trial conducted during the ragweed pollen season
in the united states [90]. a total of 536 adolescent and adult
patients with ≥2-year history of moderate-to-severe ragweedinduced sar and a baseline ige level of 30 iu/ml to 700
iu/ml were randomized to receive  xxxd2784xxx  50 mg
(n=137), 150 mg (n=134), 300 mg (n=129), or placebo
(n=136) subcutaneously once prior to the ragweed season
and every 3 (baseline ige levels 151 iu/ml to 700 iu/ml; 4
total treatments) or 4 (baseline ige 30 iu/ml to 150 iu/ml;
3 total treatments) weeks during the season. during the 12week study, patients completed symptom score selfassessments, records of rescue antihistamine use, and rhinitis quality of life questionnaires (rqlq).
sar symptom severity and duration scores were significantly lower in patients who received 300 mg of  xxxd2784xxx 
compared with those who received placebo (table 4), despite
their significantly lower use of rescue medication. a significant difference in the proportion of patients with a meaningful change from baseline (>0.5 points) in the rhinitis-related
qol score was observed in patients receiving 300 mg of

ige, allergic diseases, and  xxxd2784xxx

 xxxd2784xxx  (patients with >0.5 point improvement in overall score: 44.1% in the 300 mg  xxxd2784xxx  group vs 30.6%
in the placebo group, p=0.008). the frequency of adverse
events was similar in all  xxxd2784xxx  treatment groups and
the placebo group.
in the ragweed pollen season the following year, an
open-label 12-week extension to the study was conducted to
evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated exposure to
 xxxd2784xxx  [92]. all patients who had been treated with
 xxxd2784xxx  and who completed the initial study were eligible; 287 patients were enrolled and received 300 mg of
 xxxd2784xxx  every 3 (baseline serum ige >150 iu/ml) or 4
(baseline serum ige ≤150 iu/ml) weeks over a 12-week
period. the results showed that retreatment with  xxxd2784xxx 
was well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety
profile. in this extension study, 2.4% of patients experienced
an adverse event, but there were no severe or serious adverse
events thought to be study drug-related.
the second study was a 6-week, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study of 24 rhinitic patients (aged
19 to 50 years) with ragweed allergy [91]. after pd30 ragweed nasal allergen challenge, patients were randomized 2:1
to receive either  xxxd2784xxx , approximately 0.016 mg/kg
per ige (iu/ml), or placebo at days 0 and 28 and were rechallenged with ragweed pd 30 dose biweekly. fc epsilonri expression on blood basophils was determined by flow cytometry
at baseline and 7, 14, 28, and 42 days after treatment. free
ige levels were measured at baseline and on days 3, 28, and
42. within 3 days, mean free ige levels in the  xxxd2784xxx 
group decreased from 281 ± 55 ng/ml to 10.9 ± 1 ng/ml
(p<0.001) representing a 96% decrease from baseline. this
 xxxd2784xxx -induced decrease in free ige levels was maintained on days 28 and 42 (28.1 ± 3.7 ng/ml and 17.5 ± 2.5
ng/ml respectively, p<0.001 vs baseline). the ragweedinduced 30% nasal volume decrease at baseline dropped to

20.4%  xxxd2274xxx  to 14 days (p<0.001), 20% at 21 to 28 days
(p<0.001) and 12.2% at 35 to 42 days (p<0.001) in the
 xxxd2784xxx  group. a median decrease of 73% in basophil
fcepsilonri expression was observed in the  xxxd2784xxx  group
(p<0.001) with maximum inhibition occurring within 14
days of treatment. no significant changes in free ige levels,
nasal allergen challenge responses, or basophil fcepsilonri expression were observed throughout the study in the placebo
group [91].
a third sar study was conducted in 251 patients (aged
17 to 66 years) with birch pollen-induced sar in scandinavia [72]. patients were randomized to receive  xxxd2784xxx 
300 mg (n=165) or placebo (n=86) 2 (baseline serum ige
<150 iu/ml) or 3 (baseline serum ige >150 iu/ml) times
during the pollen season. pollen counts were higher than
usual and the season was longer than in previous years. despite this,  xxxd2784xxx  treatment was highly effective compared with placebo in reducing the average daily nasal and
ocular symptom severity scores; the proportion of days with
rescue medication use; and the amount of anti-histamine
rescue medication used (table 4).
the effectiveness of  xxxd2784xxx  treatment in perennial
allergic rhinitis (par) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week parallel group study
involving 289 patients aged 12 to 70 years ( xxxd2784xxx 
n=144; placebo n=145) with moderate-to-severe symptomatic par [93].  xxxd2784xxx  treatment significantly improved nasal symptoms, with 69% of  xxxd2784xxx -treated
patients experiencing a decrease in symptom severity compared with 49% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.001). in
terms of qol, patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx  experienced
greater improvements in rhinitis quality of life (rqol)
compared to those receiving placebo with 52% of  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients experiencing a large clinically important difference in total score (>1.5 improvement in score

from baseline) compared with 27% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.001). the treatment was well tolerated, with
similar rates of aes in both groups.
concurrent asthma and allergic rhinitis
asthma and allergic rhinitis frequently coexist [47]. the
study of  xxxd2784xxx  in co-morbid asthma and rhinitis
(solar) was a 28-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2784xxx  in 405 patients ( xxxd2784xxx  n=209; placebo n=196)
with asthma and par [85].  xxxd2784xxx  significantly reduced the asthma exacerbation rate, with 20.6% of  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients experiencing at least 1 exacerbation
compared with 30.1% of patients receiving placebo
(p=0.02), and a mean exacerbation rate of 0.25 compared
with 0.40 in the placebo group (p=0.02).  xxxd2784xxx  treatment significantly reduced the total asthma (treatment difference -1.8, p=0.023) and total rhinitis (treatment difference 3.53, p<0.001) symptom scores and improved lung function
parameters with increases from baseline in fev1 (treatment
difference 73 ml, p=0.032), fvc (treatment difference 84
ml, p=0.016), and mean daily pef (treatment difference 11
l/min, p<0.001). more patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx  experienced a significant improvement (≥1.0 improvement in
score from baseline) in qol (on aqlq and rqlq) compared with those receiving placebo (57.7% vs 40.6%,
p<0.001). treatment was well tolerated, with no significant
differences in rates of aes between treatment groups.
safety of  xxxd2784xxx 
in clinical studies the incidence of aes and safety profiles have been similar in the  xxxd2784xxx  and placebo treatment groups. the most commonly observed aes included
viral infections (23%), upper respiratory tract infection
(20%), sinusitis (16%), headache (15%) and pharyngitis
(11%) [70]. local injection-site reactions have generally
table 5.

been mild and have occurred at a similar rate in the  xxxd2784xxx  (45%) and placebo (43%) treatment groups [70].
no reactions indicative of serum sickness or serum sickness-like syndrome have been reported in the clinical trials.
three cases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions were
reported. in all cases, anaphylaxis occurred 90 minutes to 2
hours of an  xxxd2784xxx  dose, 2 episodes occurring during
first administration of  xxxd2784xxx , and one episode occurring after the fourth dose. none of the patients had vascular
collapse, but upper airway symptoms, skin symptoms and
lower airway symptoms were reported. the patients recovered fully and were discontinued from the studies. low antiomalizumab igg antibody levels were detected in 1 of 1723
patients treated with  xxxd2784xxx .
malignant neoplasms have occurred in 0.5% of  xxxd2784xxx -treated patients compared with 0.2% of placebotreated patients, with 60% of malignancies developing within
6 months of therapy [94]. among patients treated with
 xxxd2784xxx , the following malignancies each occurred more
than once: breast, nonmelanoma skin, prostate, melanoma,
and parotid. five other malignancies occurred once each
[69]. the incidence of malignancy in the  xxxd2784xxx -treated
patients is similar to that in the general population based on
data from the national cancer institute surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) initiative (table 5) [94].
there were fewer than expected malignancies among controls, suggesting that the group may not accurately represent
a random population. the number of malignant neoplasms
reported is small and the data are not statistically significant;
therefore, stochastic events leading to less than expected
numbers of malignancies in the control group cannot be excluded. furthermore, there is no dose or time of exposure
relationship between  xxxd2784xxx  and risk of malignancy, no
patients under 30 years of age have developed malignancy,
and there were no new onsets of hematologic malignancies.
the cumulative evidence suggests that a causal relationship
between  xxxd2784xxx  and malignancies is unlikely [94].

ige, allergic diseases, and  xxxd2784xxx 

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 30 3941

other clinical studies

venting ige-mediated activation of mast cells and other cells
provides an opportunity to interrupt the inflammatory cascade at a very early point, preventing a great deal of “downstream” inflammatory activity.  xxxd2784xxx , a humanized
monoclonal antibody, binds to circulating free ige and reduces the amount of ige available for responses to environmental allergens.

adjunctive therapy with allergen immunotherapy
a clinical trial was recently conducted to determine
whether  xxxd2784xxx  administered concurrently with specific
immunotherapy (sit) could improve the risk/benefit ratio of
sit in 221 polysensitized children aged 6 to 17 years during
consecutive pollen seasons [95]. each patient was started on
sit-birch (birch plus placebo, n=54; birch plus  xxxd2784xxx ,
n=55) or sit-grass treatment (grass plus placebo, n=53;
grass plus  xxxd2784xxx , n=59) for 14 weeks prior to the start
of the birch pollen season. then, 1 group in each arm received  xxxd2784xxx  for 24 weeks and the other group received placebo. sit-plus- xxxd2784xxx  therapy reduced
symptom load over the 2 pollen seasons (birch and grass) by
48% over sit alone (p<0.001) and reduced the use of rescue
medication (birch group median rescue medication score
reduced by 78% [0.27  xxxd2784xxx  vs 0.06 placebo]
p<0.001; grass group median rescue medication score reduced by 81% [0.16  xxxd2784xxx  vs 0.03 placebo] p=0.001).
in addition, patients receiving  xxxd2784xxx  required almost
no additional allergic rhinitis medication.
latex allergy
while allergy to latex was not reported extensively until
the last 2 decades, descriptions of apparent allergic reactions
to natural rubber first emerged in 1927 [96]. it is commonly
reported by health care workers who are exposed to latex
gloves and latex-containing medical supplies. latex allergy
is ige-mediated. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
conducted to investigate  xxxd2784xxx  therapy in patients
with latex allergy [97], 18 health care workers with occupational latex allergy and a positive skin-prick response to latex were randomized to receive  xxxd2784xxx  (n=9) or placebo (n=9) for 16 weeks. the primary efficacy parameter
was a conjunctival allergen test score after 8 and 16 weeks of
treatment. the mean conjunctival challenge test scores decreased substantially from baseline in the  xxxd2784xxx  group
(from 10.0 to 5.0) but not in the placebo group (from 9.67 to
9.0; p=0.003). at the end of the treatment period, scores
were negative in 57.1% of  xxxd2784xxx -treated subjects
compared with none of the placebo subjects (p=0.019). all
subjects then received 16 weeks of open-label  xxxd2784xxx 
treatment. at the end of this period, all but 1 of the previously placebo-treated subjects and all of the omalizumabtreated subjects achieved negative scores on the conjunctival
allergen test.
conclusion
ige is central to the development of allergic disease and
participates in the initiation of the inflammatory cascade
following allergen exposure in sensitized individuals. allergens bind to cell-bound specific ige molecules and, by
cross-linking the ige molecules, activate mast cells and other
cells, triggering the release of preformed and newly synthesized inflammatory mediators. these mediators cause the
early allergic response and, through chemoattractant and
other effects, recruit additional inflammatory cells to the site
and activate them. this leads to the late allergic response
and, upon repeated exposures to the allergen, chronic inflammation. the ability to intervene in this process by pre-

many patients with moderate-to-severe asthma remain
poorly controlled despite the availability of multiple therapeutic options and clear treatment guidelines. it is possible
that the “missing link” for many of these patients involves
ige-mediated inflammation, which is not addressed by ics
and long-acting beta-agonists (laba). the results of clinical trials of  xxxd2784xxx  support this possibility, as these
trials have demonstrated improvements in symptoms, reductions in exacerbation rates, improvements in qol, and other
beneficial outcomes in patients with inadequate asthma control on current standard asthma therapy. in fact, some of
these improved outcomes were seen while patients reduced
their ics doses, and many were able to eliminate their ics
doses entirely.  xxxd2784xxx  provides a valuable option for
such patients who clearly need something more than what is
offered by current standard asthma therapies.
