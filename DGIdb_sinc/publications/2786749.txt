abstract
the inhibitory effect of a diphtheria toxin-related  xxxg1173xxx  fusion
protein, il-2-toxin, on protein synthesis in adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma (atl) cells was examined in vitro. peripheral blood atl cells
from 12 patients (six acute type, four chronic type, and two smoldering
type atl) and the lymph node cells from three atl patients (two acute
type and one lymphoma type atl) were examined. at a concentration
of id * m, il-2-toxin inhibited protein synthesis by 60 to 98% in lymph
node atl cells, whereas protein synthesis in peripheral blood atl cells
was inhibited from 20 to 57% in acute type, and from 3 to 13% in chronic
type. in contrast, il-2-toxin had no measurable effect on t-cells from
either patients with smoldering type atl or normal controls. the cytopathic effects of il-2-toxin were blocked by the addition of anti-cd25
monoclonal antibody, suggesting that the inhibition of protein synthesis
in target cells was mediated by the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ). the degree of
inhibition of protein synthesis, however, was not closely correlated with
expression of  xxxg1174xxx  (low-affinity \l, 55,000 glycoprotein,  xxxg1175xxx ,
 xxxg1174xxx ) on atl cells. there was an apparent correlation between
the degree of inhibition and the rate of protein synthesis in atl cells.
we demonstrate that atl cells from patients with acute or lymphoma
type disease were more sensitive to il-2-toxin than cells from chronic or
smoldering disease. these findings suggest that the high affinity  xxxg1175xxx 
present on acute and lymphoma type atl cells may serve as a target for
therapy with this recombinant chimeric toxin.

introduction
atl2 â¡setiologically associated with htlv-1 (1-3). since
takatsuki et al. (4-6) reported a series of patients with atl,
many atl cases have been diagnosed in endemic areas of
southwest japan, the caribbean islands, and africa. clinical
observations have revealed four different types of atl: acute;
chronic; smoldering; and lymphoma type. the prototype, or
acute type atl, disease may progress acutely or subacutely; in
these patients, increased numbers of atl cells in peripheral
blood, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement
are evident. in addition, elevation of serum ldh and hypercalcemia are often observed. in lymphoma type atl, circulat
ing leukemic cells are absent; otherwise, clinical features are
similar to acute type disease. clinical manifestations of patients
with chronic type atl also include the presence of peripheral
blood atl cells, skin lesions, and sometimes a slight lymph
adenopathy and/or elevation of ldh. smoldering type atl is
characterized by circulating atl cells (0.5 to 3%) in peripheral
blood. these patients sometimes present with skin lesions as

premonitor symptoms, but have no other symptoms or clinical
abnormalities. even without therapy, patients with smoldering
or chronic type atl show relatively mild clinical symptoms.
in fact, some patients may not reach a critical stage for many
years (7, 8). both the acute and lymphoma type atl are
progressive and resistant to chemotherapy. because there are
no effective chemotherapeutic agents for treatment, the 50%
mortality rate generally falls within 5 mo of diagnosis.
the proliferation of normal activated peripheral blood tcells is mediated by an autocrine interaction between il-2 and
the high affinity  xxxg1175xxx  (10, 11). recent investigations clearly
demonstrate that the high affinity  xxxg1175xxx  is composed of at least
two polypeptides: gp55, a low-affinity glycoprotein (cd25, tac
antigen) and gp70, an intermediate-affinity glycoprotein (1216). once bound to the high affinity receptor, il-2 is rapidly
internalized into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
however, il-2 or anti-tac monoclonal antibody bound to monomeric gp55 low affinity  xxxg1175xxx  is not internalized into the cell
(17, 18). atl cells and htlv-1-infected t-cell lines have been
shown to bear the  xxxg1174xxx  (19-21) and to express cell
surface high and low affinity  xxxg1175xxx .
williams et al. (22) have recently described the genetic con
struction of a chimeric toxin in which the diphtheria toxin
receptor binding domain has been genetically replaced with  xxxg1173xxx  sequences. the resulting fusion protein, il-2-toxin, has been
purified from recombinant escherichia coli and shown to selec
tively intoxicate high affinity  xxxg1175xxx -bearing t-cells both in
vitro (22, 23) and in vivo (24). il-2-toxin has been shown to
bind to the high affinity form of the  xxxg1175xxx , to be internalized
by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and to inhibit protein syn
thesis by the adp-ribosylation of  xxxg679xxx  in
htlv-1-infected transformed t-cell lines (23). in this paper,
we have examined in vitro the cytotoxic action of il-2-toxin
toward leukemic cells isolated from patients with acute, chronic,
or smoldering atl.

cells were collected on glass fiber filters (whatman gf/c), washed,
dried, and counted by liquid scintillation according to standard methods
(23). all experiments were performed in duplicate.

and one-way test for analysis of variance were used.

results
cell surface marker analysis of peripheral blood t-cells and
lymph node t-cells. cell surface markers of pb-t and ln-t
cells are listed in table 2. as reported previously, atl cells
express the phenotype of activated t-cells and are positive for
cd2, cd3, cd4, cd25, and hla-dr antigens. the percent
age of cd4-positive cells was more than 85% in acute type
atl cells, and 74 and 86% in chronic type atl cells. in case
6, 91.4% of the ln-t expressed  xxxg388xxx , and 27.4% of it
expressed cds antigen, so a minor population of ln-t coexpressed cd4 and cds antigens. the percentage of cd25
antigen-positive cells ranged from 21.3 to 83.4% in pb-t and
49.6 to 99.5% in ln-t, respectively.

the rate of [l4c]leucine incorporation by atl cells which de
pended upon the source of leukemic t-cells (ln-t vis-a-vis pbt), as well as the clinical stage of disease. we have compared
the percentage of inhibition of protein synthesis in the presence
of 10~8 m il-2-toxin and the rate of [mc]leucine incorporation
(fig. 4b) by leukemic cells. the cytotoxicity of il-2-toxin was
correlated with the rate of leucine incorporation (/â€¢
= 0.832). in
addition, the relationship between the expression of cd25
antigen and the percentage of inhibition of protein synthesis
was examined. as shown in fig. 4a, there is no close correlation
between il-2-toxin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis
and  xxxg1174xxx  expression (r = 0.412). it is possible that
leukemic cell-bearing high-affinity il-2rs have a higher rate of
protein synthesis than cell-bearing monomeric cd25  xxxg1175xxx ,
given that  xxxg1175xxx  radioreceptor assays or  xxxg1175xxx  structure was
not probed.

recombinant dna and protein engineering methodologies
have been applied to the design and genetic construction of
chimeric toxins that are targeted toward specific cell surface
receptors (22, 26-28). the substitution of the native toxin
receptor binding domain with amino acid sequences of polypeptide hormones or growth factors has resulted in the formation
of "new" toxins with potential for therapeutic application. in
this paper, we have examined the cytotoxic action of il-2-toxin
on leukemic cells freshly isolated from atl patients. il-2toxin is a unique fusion protein which combines the receptor
binding properties of il-2 with the adp ribosyltransferase and
membrane translocation domains of diphtheria toxin (22). we
have shown that il-2-toxin effectively inhibits protein synthesis
in leukemic t-cells from patients with acute and chronic atl.
moreover, since the action of il-2-toxin was specifically
blocked by the monoclonal antibody 33b3-1 (anti-cd25), we
conclude that the action of il-2-toxin on atl cells is mediated
through the  xxxg1175xxx . leukemic t-cells purified from lymph node
aspirates of atl patients were more metabolically active with
respect to basal rates of protein synthesis, as well as more
sensitive to il-2-toxin action, than lymphoid cells from periph
eral blood. these results are consistent with earlier observations
that only  xxxg679xxx  that cycles off the ribosome is
sensitive to adp-ribosylation by diphtheria toxin fragment a;
and as a result the higher the basal rate of protein synthesis,
the greater the sensitivity of a given cell line to the action of
toxin (29).
we were not able to demonstrate an inhibition of protein
synthesis by il-2-toxin in leukemic t-cells purified from the
peripheral blood of patients with smoldering atl. since these
preparations only contained 2 to 3% leukemic cells, il-2-toxinmediated inhibition of protein synthesis would be difficult to
detect against the background of normal cell incorporation.
there are differences between peripheral blood atl cells
with respect to the percentage of inhibition of protein synthesis
by il-2-toxin from acute and chronic cases of atl. it has been
recently shown that the action of il-2-toxin is most efficiently
mediated through the high affinity form of the  xxxg1175xxx .' our
examinations suggest that leukemic cells from acute atl have
a higher number of high affinity  xxxg1175xxx  than the corresponding
cells from chronic atl. uchiyama et al. (30) have examined
the number of high and low affinity  xxxg1175xxx  with a radiolabeled
il-2 binding assay and have found that acute atl cells express
250 high affinity and 2250 low affinity il-2rs per cell. to date

il-2 toxin cytotoxicity toward ati. lymphocytes

there are no reports which describe the numbers of high and
low affinity receptors on the surface of chronic atl cells. it is
well known that atl cells freshly isolated from patients do not
proliferate and respond poorly to exogenous il-2. arima et al.
(31) have recently reported that acute atl cells respond to
added il-2, but chronic atl cells failed to do so. the results
presented in this paper suggest that il-2 and its receptor may
play a role in the proliferation of leukemic cells from patients
with acute type atl.
the basal rate of protein synthesis in atl cells was examined
by monitoring the incorporation of [mc]leucine in the absence
of added il-2-toxin. lymph node cells of acute and lymphoma
type atl consistently showed a high level of leucine incorpo
ration, whereas peripheral blood leukemic cells from acute atl
patients showed moderate levels of incorporation, and periph
eral blood cells from chronic atl patients incorporated leucine
poorly. we have also observed that, from the same patient,
rates of leucine incorporation were higher in lymph node cells
than peripheral blood cells. these results suggest that atl cell
proliferation mainly occurs in the lymph node or other tissues
including skin. indeed, the basal rate of protein synthesis in
atl cells may bear a significant relationship to the severity of
disease.
waldmann et al. (32) have treated three patients with acute
atl using anti-cd25 antibody and have observed partial re
mission in one patient. however, the use of monoclonal anti
bodies, or their corresponding immunotoxins, for the treatment
of atl may have several disadvantages. monoclonal anti-tac
(anti-cd25) is not easily internalized by the  xxxg1175xxx , thereby
suggesting poor clinical efficacy for anti-cd25-based immu
notoxins. moreover, since murine antibodies fail to efficiently
bind human complement, cytolysis of leukemic t-cells would
not be expected following treatment with anti-cd25 monoclo
nal antibody alone.
for clinical management, patients with acute and lymphoma
type atl need intensive chemotherapy (which is generally
ineffective), while patients with chronic atl are generally not
treated until they progress to acute type disease. since il-2toxin is selectively active against high affinity  xxxg1175xxx -positive
proliferating t-cells, its administration may be a rational ap
proach to the treatment of acute, chronic, and lymphoma type
atl.
