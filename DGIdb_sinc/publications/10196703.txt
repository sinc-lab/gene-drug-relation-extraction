an elevated level of homocysteine in plasma is associated with the occurrence of
cardiovascular disease. a common ala-to-val mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase gene ( xxxg1475xxx ) is associated with an elevated level of plasma homocysteine. we
studied the possible detrimental effects of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation on mortality. within a
population-based study in the city of leiden, the netherlands, we first compared the  xxxg1475xxx 
genotype distribution among 365 elderly subjects aged 85 years and over born in leiden, and
250 young subjects aged 18 to 40 years whose families originated from the same geographical
region. second, the complete cohort of 666 subjects aged 85 years and over was followed over
a period of 10 years for all-cause and cause-specific mortality and stratified according to
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype. the frequency of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation was significantly lower in the
elderly than in the young (0.30 and 0.36, respectively; p = 0.03). the difference in genotype
distribution was only present in men. the estimated mortality risk up to 85 years in men
carrying the val/val genotype was 3.7 (95% confidence interval (ci), 1.3–10.9). over the age
of 85, mortality in men with the val/val genotype was increased 2.0-fold (95% ci, 1.1–3.9) and
appeared to be attributable to cancer rather than cardiovascular causes of death. among
women aged 85 years and over, no deleterious effect of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation was observed.
in conclusion, the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation is associated with increased mortality in men in middle
and old age, but not in women.

introduction
an elevated level of homocysteine in plasma is associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease1
and increased mortality in patients with coronary artery
disease.2 a recent meta-analysis estimated that every
5 µmol/l increment in plasma homocysteine increases
the risk of coronary heart disease by 60% for men and
80% for women.1 homocysteine is formed when the
methyl-group of methionine is transferred to dna,
proteins or other molecules. the basal level of plasma
homocysteine is mainly determined by the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.3,4 this reaction is
regulated by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx )3 which converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. the
methionine/homocysteine metabolism is disrupted by
deficiencies in the essential coenzymes  xxxd3049xxx , b12
and folate, and by homozygosity for rare mutations in
the genes encoding  xxxg1475xxx  and cystathionine beta
synthase.5,6 these genetic defects give rise to greatly
elevated homocysteine levels in plasma and result in
mental retardation, bone malformations and premature
atherosclerotic disease.5,6
recently, a common  xxxd2692xxx -to-t (ala-to-val) mutation
in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene was identified7 which leads to a
less severe disturbance of the methionine/homocysteine
metabolism. about half the general population carries
at least one mutated allele and the frequency of the
homozygous mutated genotype (val/val) varies from
8% to 18% depending on the population.8–19 the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation was shown to render the enzyme
thermolabile, and homozygotes and heterozygotes had
about a 70% and 35% reduced  xxxg1475xxx  activity,
respectively.7 furthermore, homozygosity for the mutation is associated with elevated levels of homocysteine
in plasma.7,9,11,15–17,19–21 this association is dependent
on age15,17 and nutrition. plasma homocysteine levels
are predominantly elevated among carriers of the val/
val genotype who have a low level of plasma
folate.9,11,15 moreover, it was shown that especially in
val/val carriers the level of plasma homocysteine was
lowered by  xxxd2146xxx  supplementation.22 in various
reports the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation has been implicated in
the risk of cardiovascular disease4,10,14–16,18,19,21,23–28 and
cancer12,29 but the data are equivocal.
to explore the possible detrimental effects of a
disturbed methionine/homocysteine metabolism, we
studied the association between the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation
and mortality, nested in a population-based study of
subjects aged 85 years and over (leiden 85-plus study).

this was done (i) in a cross-sectional analysis comparing the occurrence of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation between
subjects aged 85 years and over and young subjects
aged 18–40 years whose families originated from the
same geographical region as the elderly subjects, and
(ii), prospectively, over a 10-year follow-up period in
the entire elderly cohort. the follow-up study included
the analysis of cause-specific mortality risks.

materials and methods
the leiden 85-plus study is a population-based study in
which all inhabitants of leiden aged 85 years and over were
invited to take part.30 of a total of 1258 eligible subjects, 221
died before enrolment which lasted from 1 december 1986 to
1 march 1988. of the 1037 remaining subjects, 977 (94%)
participated and were medically interviewed at home.31 after
the exclusion of subjects with a non-dutch (n = 29) or
unknown (n = 69) place of birth, sufficient cell material was
available from 666 (188 men, 478 women) subjects for the
present genetic study. dna was extracted32 and  xxxg1475xxx 
genotypes were determined by the pcr-amplification of a
198 bp fragment containing the  xxxd2692xxx -to-t transition, followed
by digestion with hinfi as previously described.7 the
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype was independently assessed by two
observers. as a standard laboratory procedure a randomly
chosen 10% of the samples was reamplified. no genotyping
errors were observed. the study was approved by the medical
ethics committee of leiden university and informed consent
was obtained from all participants.

cross-sectional analysis
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype distributions were compared in elderly
subjects aged 85 years and over and young controls. the
subjects in the elderly population are survivors of a cohort
born between 1887–1901. to avoid false associations with the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation due to differences in geographical origin
rather than age, the cross-sectional comparison of elderly and
young subjects accounted for local variations in  xxxg1475xxx 
genotype distribution that may have existed in the past.
subjects aged 85 years and over who were born in leiden
(n = 365; 56%) were compared with a control population
which consisted of 250 (139 men, 111 women) blood donors
aged 18–40 years of dutch descent with either one parent
born in leiden and the other within 12 km of leiden, or with
two leiden-born parents. information regarding the birthplace of their grandparents was obtained from a written
questionnaire. if a specific leiden  xxxg1475xxx  genotype distribution had existed in the past, the genotype distribution in
young controls would have increasingly deviated, the greater
the number of their leiden-born grandparents. the upper age
limit of the young controls was chosen since selection against
genotypes contributing to population mortality was not
expected to occur before the age of 40 years.

prospective follow-up study
all participants in the leiden 85-plus study were followed up
for mortality until 1 october 1996. among the 666 subjects of
the cohort studied, two were lost to follow-up. primary causes
of death were assessed by linking the death certificate

numbers, obtained from civic registers, to the causes of death
as recorded by the dutch central bureau of statistics. causes
of death were classified according to the ninth revision of the
international classification of diseases (icd-9).33 death
certificates from 1996, coded according to the tenth revision
of the international classification of diseases, were recoded
according to the ninth revision. icd-9 codes were reviewed
and each code was categorised for cardiovascular disease
(icd-9 390–459), cancer (icd-9 140-239) and all causes
(icd-9 000–999). death from infection was coded as previously described.34

statistical analysis
differences in baseline characteristics were tested for significance with the chi2 test for categorical and student’s t-test
for continuous variables. in the cross-sectional analysis,
distributions of alleles and genotypes were compared by the
chi2 test, and mortality risks and 95% cis were estimated using
the exposure odds ratio. mantel’s extension of the mantelhaenszel test was used to test for trend in stratified analyses.35
in the follow-up study, survival times for subjects were
computed from the date of the home visit to the date of one
of the following events: death from a specific cause, death
from any cause, or 1 october 1996. survival was estimated
using the kaplan-meier product limit method and compared
with the log-rank test. adjusted mortality risks and 95% cis
were estimated with cox proportional hazards models.
causes of death were assumed to be independent. p-values of
less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance and all p-values were based on two-sided tests. the
analyses were performed with the spss statistical software
package.

results
cross-sectional analysis
table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study
subjects from the cohort of leiden inhabitants aged
85 years and over (n = 666). a gender difference was
observed with respect to smoking habits, alcohol
consumption and the prevalence of hypertension and

cancer. the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype distribution in the
complete cohort was 46.5% (ala/ala), 44.4% (ala/val)
and 9.0% (val/val). for the cross-sectional analysis,
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype frequencies in the elderly subjects
born in leiden (56% of the complete cohort) were
compared with those in young subjects aged
18–40 years whose families originated from the leiden
area (table 2). genotype frequencies in both groups
were in agreement with the distribution predicted by
the hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the prevalence of the
val/val genotype in the control population (12.4%,
n = 250) was consistent with the 10–18% reported for
other populations greater than 200 subjects of european, north-american and australian origin.8–13,15–17
the frequency of the val allele was significantly lower
in elderly subjects than in young subjects (0.30 and 0.36,
respectively; chi2df = 1 = 4.74, p = 0.030). this observation
was illustrated by the over-representation of the ala/ala
genotype (48.2% vs 40.0%) and the under-representation of ala/val (43.0% vs 47.6) and val/val genotype
(8.8% vs 12.4%) in elderly subjects as compared with
young subjects.
since the mortality and specific death causes differ
between men and women, and the exposure to factors
which potentially modulate the effects of the  xxxg1475xxx 
mutation, may vary between men and women, the
association was explored for men and women separately. the prevalence of the val/val genotype in elderly
men was significantly lower than in elderly women
(4.4% and 10.8%, respectively; chi2df = 1 = 3.97,
p = 0.046), whereas the val/val frequency was virtually
the same in young men and women (12.2% and 12.6%,
respectively; chi2df = 1 = 0.01, p = 0.93). hence, the frequency of the ala/val and val/val genotypes were
significantly reduced in elderly men as compared with

mortality risks were estimated on the basis of the
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype distributions in elderly and young
subjects. the mortality risks associated with the ala/val
and the val/val genotype were estimated at 1.3-fold
(95% ci, 0.9–1.9) and 1.7-fold (95% ci, 1.0–3.0)
increases, respectively (table 2). the mortality risk for
men carrying the val/val genotype compared with those
carrying the ala/ala genotype was estimated at 3.7 (95%
ci, 1.3–10.9), whereas an increased mortality risk was
virtually absent in women.
the elderly subjects were the survivors of a cohort
born in leiden between 1887 and 1901. therefore an
investigation was made of whether the young control
population was likely to represent the leiden genotype
distribution of two generations earlier. the  xxxg1475xxx 
genotype distribution in control subjects was independent of the number of grandparents born in leiden
(table 3). this indicates that the selection criterion for
the control population (i.e. either two leiden-born
parents or one leiden-born parent and the other born

obtain a population representing past leiden genotype
frequencies.

prospective follow-up study
during the 10-year follow-up period, 591 (89%) deaths
occurred in the complete 85-plus cohort investigated in
this study (n = 666; two subjects were lost to follow up).
the cumulative survival of men and women stratified
according to  xxxg1475xxx  genotype is shown in figure 1.
men carrying the val/val genotype survived for a
shorter time (p log-rank = 0.020). the median survival
time of this group was 11 months compared with
38 months and 36 months for men with ala/ala and ala/
val genotype, respectively. among women, the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation was not associated with a difference
in life expectancy (p log-rank = 0.16).
overall, the ala/val and val/val genotypes were not
associated with an increased mortality risk (gender and
age-adjusted relative risk, 0.9 [95% ci, 0.7–1.0] and 0.9
[95% ci, 0.6–1.2], respectively). however, men homozygous for the mutation, but not heterozygous men,
had a significantly increased mortality risk compared
with men carrying the ala/ala genotype (age-adjusted
relative risk, 2.0 [95% ci, 1.1–3.9]) (table 4). this
mortality risk did not appreciably change when
adjusted for smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension and diabetes (relative risk, 2.0 [95% ci,
0.9–4.4]). among women, the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation was
associated with marginally lower mortality risks, which
bordered on the significant.
in the elderly cohort, the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation was not
associated with a self-reported history of myocardial
infarction or cerebrovascular disease (data not shown).

mortality in a cohort of men and women born between
1887–1901. it can be assumed that carriers of the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation, in general, have a mildly disturbed
methionine/homocysteine metabolism during their
whole life. the effect of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation on
mortality before the age of 85 was studied in a crosssectional design that accounted for possible geographical differences in the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype distribution. the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation was associated with an
increased mortality risk as indicated by an underrepresentation of the mutation in elderly compared
with young subjects. the association was predominantly
present in men. men homozygous for the mutation had
about a 4-fold increased mortality risk. our findings are
supported by the reduction of the val/val genotype

the mutation was also not associated with cardiovascular mortality either in men or women (table 4). the
mortality risk from cancer, however, was significantly
higher among men with the val/val genotype (ageadjusted relative risk, 4.2 [95% ci, 1.3–13.5]), whereas
among women carrying the val/val genotype the risk
was not significantly different.

discussion
in this study we have explored the possible detrimental
effects of a disturbed methionine/homocysteine metabolism. this was done by investigating the association
of the common  xxxg1475xxx  ala-to-val mutation with

figure 1 kaplan-meier estimate of 10-year cumulative survival according to  xxxg1475xxx  genotype for men and women aged 85 years

observed in french centenarians17 and the gradual
decline in prevalence of the val/val genotype with
increasing age found in japanese subjects,36 whereas
two other cross-sectional studies37,38 did not observe a
decreased prevalence of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation in old
age. the design of these studies, however, did not
extensively check for geographical variations in genotype distribution or gene-pool effects. also, population
differences in factors modulating the effect of the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation may have contributed to these
variable results.
mortality after the age of 85 years was examined
during a 10-year follow-up period. the mutation
conferred a 2-fold increased mortality risk in elderly
men homozygous for the mutation, but not in women.
the prospective follow-up study thus confirms the
increased mortality risk associated with the  xxxg1475xxx 
mutation observed in our cross-sectional analysis.
the relation of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation with risk of
cardiovascular disease is controversial. some studies
reported an association of the val/val genotype with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease,4,14,18,23 whereas
in other studies evidence for this relation was
absent.10,15,16,19,21,24–28 here, we show that the  xxxg1475xxx 
mutation was associated with an increased mortality in
men before and after the age of 85 years but, by design,
no data were available concerning the causes of death
in middle age. over the age of 85 years, cardiovascular
diseases did not contribute to the increased mortality of
men with the val/val genotype. although half the
elderly men and women died from cardiovascular
disease (data not shown), the mutation was not
associated with increased cardiovascular disease mortality. two interpretations are compatible with these
findings. the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation is not related to
mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in middle and
old age. alternatively, carriers of the mutation are
subject to an increased cardiovascular disease mortality
before the age of 85 years, which has led to the selective
survival of carriers who are less susceptible to cardiovascular diseases.
although the numbers were small, we found that the
increased mortality risk of men aged 85 years and over
with the val/val genotype was largely explained by an
increased risk of death due to cancer. an association
between the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation and the risk of colorectal cancer was reported in two other prospective
studies. united states health professionals12 and physicians29 carrying the val/val genotype were found to
have a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. this protective

effect was abolished by moderate alcohol consumption,
probably because alcohol depletes folate.39 it is not
clear how the opposite effects of the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation
on cancer risk in our population-based study and the
previous studies can be explained. the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation may increase the risk of cancer especially in groups
with a low folate intake, such as the elderly, rather than
in
well-nourished
health
professionals
and
12,29
physicians.
from the present data it remains unclear why men
carrying the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation were at an increased
risk of mortality, whereas mortality in women carrying
the mutation was not affected. hormonal differences
with respect to oestrogens are a less likely explanation
for the association observed, since the genderdependent association with mortality persisted after the
age of 85 years when women are well beyond the
menopause. influence of oestrogens on the methionine/
homocysteine metabolism is further refuted by the
absence of a long-term effect of hormone replacement
therapy on the level of plasma homocysteine.40 since
the level of plasma folate is a critical modulator of the
 xxxg1475xxx  mutation, differences in the level of plasma
folate between men and women may also have contributed to the gender-dependent association. a previous
study in elderly subjects, however, reported no difference in the level of plasma folate between men and
women despite the higher folate intake of women.41
a clear gender difference was present with respect to
smoking habits and alcohol consumption; 51% of the
men and only 4% of the women reported smoking, and
49% of the men reported alcohol consumption vs 16%
of the women. smoking is associated with elevated
plasma homocysteine,15,42 whereas alcohol is a methyl
group antagonist and depletes folate.39 it may be
hypothesised that the combined effects of smoking,
alcohol consumption and the  xxxg1475xxx  mutation on the
methionine/homocysteine metabolism might have led
to an increased mortality risk in men but not in women.
especially among individuals from the 1887–1901 birth
cohort, who were middle aged during the 1930s to
1960s; the majority of men smoked, whereas among
women smoking was uncommon.
in conclusion, our data suggest that homozygosity for
the  xxxg1475xxx  ala-to-val mutation increases the mortality
risk in men both in middle and old age. our study does
not reveal the causes of death contributing to the
increased mortality risk in middle age, but suggests that
cancer rather than cardiovascular disease may be the
primary cause of death in elderly men carrying the val/

val genotype. larger prospective population-based
studies are needed to confirm the effect of the  xxxg1475xxx 
mutation on all-cause and cancer mortality. interventions starting at a young age to restore a balanced
methionine/homocysteine metabolism may prove to be
beneficial to carriers of the val/val genotype.
