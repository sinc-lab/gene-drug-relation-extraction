ca2⫹ entry through voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels initiates
a variety of cellular processes, including neurotransmitter
release, muscle contraction, and gene expression. voltagegated ca2⫹ channels are heteromultimeric complexes consisting of ␣1, ␤, ␥, and ␣2/␦ subunits. the ␣1 subunit is the
pore-forming subunit and contains the key structural determinants required for gating, drug binding, and ion permeation (fig. 1a). ca2⫹ channels of the  xxxg346xxx  subfamily conduct
l-type ca2⫹ currents and are the target proteins for a number of drugs, including the dihydropyridines (dhps). dhps
are allosteric modulators of channel gating and may act as
either agonists favoring an open state (brown et al., 1984;
hess et al., 1984; kokubun and reuter, 1984; thomas et al.,
1985; sanguinetti et al., 1986) or antagonists favoring closed
states of the channel (bean, 1984; sanguinetti and kass,

affinities are decreased up to 10-fold and are up to 150-fold
less sensitive to ca2⫹ than wild-type channels. analysis of
mutations of amino acid residues adjacent to the selectivity
filter led to identification of phe-1013 and tyr-1021, whose
mutation causes substantial changes in dhp binding. thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis of these mutants demonstrates
that phe-1013 and tyr-1021 are energetically coupled when a
single ca2⫹ ion is bound to the channel pore. we propose that
dhp binding stabilizes a nonconducting state containing a
single ca2⫹ ion in the pore through which phe-1013 and tyr1021 are energetically coupled. the selectivity filter in this
energetically coupled high-affinity state is blocked by bound
ca2⫹, which is responsible for the high-affinity inhibition of
ca2⫹ channels by dhp antagonists.

1984; gurney et al., 1985; kokubun et al., 1986; cohen and
mccarthy, 1987; hamilton et al., 1987). although it is clear
that dhps modulate channel-gating mechanisms, the molecular basis for dhp action remains unknown.
localizing the dhp receptor site was an important first
step toward elucidating the mechanism by which dhps modulate ca2⫹ channel gating. nine key residues important for
drug binding and unique to dhp-sensitive channels were
localized to transmembrane segments iiis5, iiis6, and ivs6
(mitterdorfer et al., 1996; peterson et al., 1996; schuster et
al., 1996; he et al., 1997; peterson et al., 1997). when these
nine l-type-specific amino acids are substituted into a dhpinsensitive ␣1 subunit, the resulting channel becomes sensitive to both dhp agonists and antagonists (hockerman et al.,
1997; ito et al., 1997; sinnegger et al., 1997). these studies
indicate that transmembrane segments iiis5, iiis6, and
ivs6 (fig. 1a, dark cylinders) form the dhp receptor site.
the ca2⫹ channel pore contains a ca2⫹ binding site consisting of one negatively charged glutamate residue from
each domain, which collectively form the selectivity filter

abstract
dihydropyridines (dhps) are an important class of drugs, used
extensively in the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension,
and arrhythmia. the molecular mechanism by which dhps
modulate ca2⫹ channel function is not known in detail. we
have found that dhp binding is allosterically coupled to ca2⫹
binding to the selectivity filter of the skeletal muscle ca2⫹
channel  xxxg310xxx , which initiates excitation-contraction coupling
and conducts l-type ca2⫹ currents. increasing ca2⫹ concentrations from approximately 10 nm to 1 mm causes the dhp
receptor site to shift from a low-affinity state to a high-affinity
state with an ec50 for ca2⫹ of 300 nm. substituting each of the
four negatively charged glutamate residues that form the ion
selectivity filter with neutral glutamine or positively charged
lysine residues results in mutant channels whose dhp binding

binding and repulsion of ions within the selectivity filter are
core features of recent models of the pore that are based more
on structure than the original two-site models (dang and
mccleskey, 1998; nonner et al., 1998; boda et al., 2001;
corry et al., 2001; lipkind and fozzard, 2001).
we and others have found that high-affinity dhp binding
is dependent on ca2⫹ binding to the selectivity filter (mitterdorfer et al., 1995; peterson and catterall, 1995). these findings establish an important link between dhp binding to its
receptor site deep within the lipid bilayer and ca2⫹ binding
to the selectivity filter in the outer pore. this relationship
offers a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of
the molecular basis for dhp action, ion permeation, and
gating. we have systematically characterized the dhp and
ca2⫹ binding characteristics of mutant ca2⫹ channels whose
pore-forming glutamate residues have been replaced by glutamine or lysine. we analyzed these mutants using an allosteric binding model that enabled us to determine 1) the
actual dissociation constants for ca2⫹ binding to the selectivity filter at any dhp concentration, 2) the dissociation
constant for dhp binding at any ca2⫹ concentration, and 3)
the magnitude of two allosteric factors that couple dhp and
ca2⫹ binding. we found that all four of the glutamate residues that form the ion selectivity filter are important for
dhp and ca2⫹ binding. mutational analysis of several nonglutamate residues in the outer pore revealed altered dhp
and ca2⫹ sensitivity as well. thermodynamic mutant cycle
analysis (carter et al., 1984; hidalgo and mackinnon, 1995)
of two of these mutants, f1013g and y1021k, indicate that
phe-1013 and tyr-1021 are energetically coupled when a
single ca2⫹ ion is bound in the selectivity filter, suggesting
that dhp binding promotes structural rearrangements in
the outer pore that involve the energetic coupling of phe1013 and tyr-1021 via a single bound ca2⫹ ion. we discuss
our findings in the context of current theoretical and structural models for permeation (nonner et al., 1998; boda et al.,
2001; corry et al., 2001; lipkind and fozzard, 2001; wang et
al., 2005) and propose that dhps block monovalent and
divalent currents by stabilizing a nonconducting blocked
state that is structurally and functionally analogous to a
channel with a single ca2⫹ ion in its selectivity filter.

materials and methods

fig. 1. the selectivity filter consists of four negatively charged glutamate
residues that bind a single ca2⫹ ion with a high affinity or two ca2⫹ ions
with a low affinity. a, the ␣1 subunit of the ca2⫹ channel consists of four
homologous repeats (i, ii, iii, and iv) that assemble to form the pore of
the channel complex. each repeat consists of six transmembrane segments, s1–s6. the loops connecting the 5th and 6th transmembrane
segments from each repeat contain highly conserved glutamate residues
(denoted with an e) that collectively form the selectivity filter. the
selectivity filter is capable of binding a single ca2⫹ ion with a high
affinity or two ca2⫹ ions with a low affinity. dihydropyridine agonists
and antagonists interact with amino acid residues located in transmembrane segments iiis5, iiis6, and ivs6 (dark cylinders). b, the pore
segments from each of the four domains of the dhp-sensitive ( xxxg310xxx -4)
and -insensitive ( xxxg302xxx -3) ca2⫹ channels are aligned. the ca2⫹ binding
glutamate residues that form the selectivity filter are indicated with
boxes.

preparation of wild-type and mutant  xxxg310xxx  membranes.
wild-type and mutant ␣1s ( xxxg310xxx ) ca2⫹ channels were coexpressed
with the ␤1a and ␣2␦ subunits as described previously (peterson and
catterall, 1995). in brief, cdnas encoding all the channel subunits
were cotransfected into tsa-201 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation, and membranes were harvested 2 to 3 days after transfection.
cells were washed twice in buffer a (50 mm tris, 100 ␮m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ␮m  xxxd302xxx  1.0 ␮m pepstatin a,
1.0 ␮g/␮l leupeptin, and 2.0 ␮g/ml aprotinin, ph 8.0). cells were
scraped and homogenized in the same buffer using a glass-teflon
homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 1700g for 10 min,
and the resulting pellet was discarded. the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min, and the resulting membrane pellet was
washed and homogenized in buffer a. membrane aliquots remained
stable for several months, but they were typically used within 1 week
of harvesting.
radioligand binding. saturation binding assays were performed in buffer a using 20 to 100 ␮g of membrane protein, 0.1 to 10
nm (⫹)-[3h]pn200-110 (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences,
boston, ma), and the indicated concentrations of free ca2⫹ for 120

(fig. 1). the selectivity filter is thought to consist of a negatively charged locus capable of binding a single ca2⫹ with
high affinity or two ca2⫹ ions with low affinity (hille, 2001;
sather and mccleskey, 2003). in the absence of divalent
cations, ca2⫹ channels are highly permeable to monovalent
cations. under such conditions, ca2⫹ functions as a channel
blocker with an ic50 in the submicromolar range. monovalent currents are blocked by ca2⫹ ions because monovalent
cations are unable to dislodge tightly bound ca2⫹ ions from
the selectivity filter. currents carried by ca2⫹ ions occur
when ca2⫹ is raised to the millimolar range because repulsive forces from a second ca2⫹ ion entering the pore increase
the exit rate of the bound ca2⫹ ion by more than 10,000-fold
at physiological ca2⫹ concentrations (almers and mccleskey, 1984; hess and tsien, 1984; yue and marban, 1990).
the original two-site barrier model nicely simulates most of
the permeation properties of the channel, but it has limited
value when applied to structural studies. however, the primary features of this model (i.e., binding and repulsion)
almost certainly are dominant forces in a conducting pore.

modulation of l-type calcium channels by dihydropyridines

fig. 2. ca2⫹ is a positive allosteric modulator of dhp binding. a, membranes prepared from cells expressing wild-type ca2⫹ channels were
incubated with [3h]pn200-110 at a concentration equal to its dissociation
constant measured in 1 mm free ca2⫹ (1 ⫻ kd1) and the indicated
concentrations of free ca2⫹ (see materials and methods). data from one
such experiment (circles) demonstrate that increasing ca2⫹ from 10 nm
to 1 mm results in a large increase in dhp binding with an ec50 of
approximately 0.3 ␮m. further increases in ca2⫹ to the 100 mm range
result in a large decrease in dhp binding with an ic50 in the high
millimolar range. the line is a smooth fit through the data points and was
generated using scheme 1 (b). scheme 1 describes  xxxg304xxx  as possessing
a single dhp receptor site that can exist in one of three affinity states,
depending on whether zero, one, or two ca2⫹ ions are bound to the
selectivity filter. scheme 1 is thermodynamically constrained such that
dissociation constants for dhp and ca2⫹ binding are coupled by the
factors ␣ and ␤. high-affinity dhp binding stabilizes a nonconducting,
blocked state that is structurally analogous to a channel with a single
ca2⫹ ion in its selectivity filter (dashed box). scheme 1 is further described in the text.

channels was evaluated using a two-tailed student’s t test and analysis of variance (fig. 3). data are means ⫾ s.e.m., and statistical
significance was set at p ⬍ 0.05 (ⴱ).

results
an allosteric binding model describes the positive
cooperativity between dhp and ca2ⴙ binding. the
dhp receptor site can exist in multiple affinity states depending on the level of ca2⫹ present (glossmann et al., 1985;
mitterdorfer et al., 1995; peterson and catterall, 1995). in
fig. 2a, membranes derived from cells expressing the wildtype skeletal muscle ca2⫹ channel ( xxxg310xxx ) were tested for
binding using the dhp antagonist [3h] (⫹)-pn200-110 in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of free ca2⫹. increasing the free ca2⫹ from less than 10 nm to 100 ␮m
causes a substantial increase in the level of (⫹)-pn200-110
binding with an ec50 of approximately 0.33 ␮m, followed by
a reduction in binding with an ic50 of more than 100 mm. we
initially fit these data using an allosteric model where a
single dhp receptor site could exist in one of three interconvertible affinity states dependent on whether zero, one, or
two divalent cations bound to the channel (peterson and
catterall, 1995). we later found that this model could not
adequately describe our data under all experimental conditions. for example, the ec50 values measured in our ca2⫹
response experiments are dependent on the concentration of
dhp used in the experiment—i.e., increasing dhp levels
shift the ec50 to the left and decreasing dhp levels shift the
ec50 to the right. therefore, we revised this model such that
it is now thermodynamically constrained and better describes the allosteric behavior of our system (fig. 2b, scheme
1). this revised version of scheme 1 is superior to its predecessor for three main reasons: 1) the true dissociation constants for ca2⫹ binding to the selectivity filter at any dhp
concentration can now be determined; 2) two of the three
independent dissociation constants for dhp binding have
been eliminated; and 3) two coupling factors, ␣ and ␤, have
been introduced that couple dhp and ca2⫹ binding. using
this revised version of scheme 1 (fig. 2b), we are now able to
quantitatively assess the binding affinity for ca2⫹ to the
channel and the cooperativity between the ca2⫹ and dhp
receptor sites. it turns out that ␣, which was absent in the
original model, is altered in several of the most interesting
mutant channels assessed in these studies (see below).
figure 2b, scheme 1, is thermodynamically constrained
such that the ratio of dissociation constants for dhp binding
in the absence and presence of ca2⫹ must equal to the ratio
of the dissociation constants for ca2⫹ binding in the absence
and presence of dhp. therefore, the individual dissociation
constants for dhp and ca2⫹ binding are completely determined by kd1, the dissociation constant for dhp binding to a
channel whose selectivity filter is occupied by a single ca2⫹
ion, and kc1, the dissociation constant for ca2⫹ binding to
dhp-occupied ca2⫹ channels, respectively, and the allosteric
factors ␣ and ␤.

min at 22°c. nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of
1 ␮m (⫾)-pn200-110, thus reducing kon for the radiolabeled ligand to
an insignificant level, and bound radioligand was recovered by vacuum filtration using gf/c glass fiber filters.
experiments that measure the ca2⫹ dependence of [3h](⫹)pn200-110 binding were performed on membranes prepared from
cells expressing wild-type and mutant ca2⫹ channels. membranes
were incubated in buffer a containing [3h](⫹)-pn200-110 at a concentration producing an occupancy of 0.5 in optimal ca2⫹ [i.e., equal
to the dissociation constant for [3h](⫹)-pn200-110 for that channel
determined by saturation binding in 1 mm free ca2⫹], and the
indicated concentrations of free ca2⫹. free ca2⫹ was buffered by the
addition of 5 mm edta, 5 mm n-2[2-hydroxyethyl-edta, and 5 mm
 xxxd2739xxx , and the amounts of cacl2 required to yield the
desired concentrations of free ca2⫹ were determined using the ca2⫹buffering calculator maxc (chris patton, stanford university, stanford, ca).

fig. 3. ca2⫹ binding to the selectivity filter is allosterically coupled to
dhp binding. a and b, individual dissociation constants, kd1 (a) and kc1
(b), were determined for [3h]pn200-110 and ca2⫹ binding to wild-type
and the indicated mutant channels as described under materials and
methods. kd1 and kc1 values for all glutamine and lysine substitutions
are significantly different from wild type. kc1 for the glutamine substitutions in domains ii, iii, and iv are significantly different from e292q.
kd1 values for e292q and e1014q are significantly different from
e1323q but not e614q. c, values for the coupling factor ␣ were determined as described under materials and methods using fig. 2b, scheme
1 (also see fig. 2a).

that collectively form the selectivity filter (fig. 1b, boxes)
was replaced by a neutral glutamine or a positively charged
lysine residue, generating the mutants e292q, e614q,
e1014q, e1323q, e292k, e614k, e1014k, and e1323k.
e614k and e1323k exhibited no dhp binding and were not
studied further. kd1 for each mutant was determined by
saturation binding in the presence of 1 mm free ca2⫹ and
increasing concentrations of (⫹)-pn200-110. kd1 values for
wild-type and each of the mutant channels are summarized
in fig. 3a and table 1. the sensitivity of the wild-type and
mutant channels to ca2⫹ was determined by incubating
membranes in a concentration of (⫹)-pn200-110 equal to the
measured kd1 value for that particular channel (resulting in
an occupancy of 0.5) plus increasing concentrations of free
ca2⫹, as described under materials and methods. kc1 and ␣
were determined by fitting these data using fig. 2b, scheme
1, with kd1 and free (⫹)-pn200-110 serving as fixed parameters. kd1, kc1, and ␣ for wild-type and each mutant channel
are summarized in fig. 3 and table 1.
dhp binding, the sensitivity of dhp binding to ca2⫹, and
the coupling factor ␣ are altered for the mutant channels.
the values determined for kd1 are increased 5.5- to 10-fold
by these mutations (fig. 3a; table 1). although the four
glutamate residues are not contiguously localized on the
primary sequence, each functions as an important dhp binding determinant in the presence of ca2⫹, suggesting that the
selectivity filter acts as a unified locus that modulates dhp
binding. alteration of the four glutamate residues affects
kd1, kc1, and ␣ to different extents. these differences indicate that the binding site for ca2⫹ ions is asymmetrical, as
is the coupling of each glutamate residue to dhp binding
(fig. 3).
as expected for mutant channels with amino acid substitutions in their selectivity filters, dramatic changes in kc1
were observed (fig. 3b). the smallest change in kc1 was
observed with e292q, whose binding of ca2⫹ is reduced by
less than 12-fold. kc1 for the other glutamate mutants was
increased by 90- to 150-fold.
the allosteric coupling factor ␣, which reflects the effect of
binding of one ca2⫹ ion on dhp affinity, was reduced from
15.5 for wild type to values ranging from 1.3 to 9.8 for the
glutamate substitution mutants (fig. 3c). e292q, whose
value for ␣ was increased to 54.5, was the only exception to
this trend. the role ␣ plays in determining dhp binding
properties is discussed in greater detail below. together, the
changes in kd1, kc1, and ␣ in these mutants indicate that the
dhp receptor site is allosterically coupled to the selectivity
filter of l-type ca2⫹ channels. therefore, it is plausible that
the molecular details that underlie dhp activity may involve
structural rearrangements in the outer pore and selectivity
filter of the channel.
uncharged residues in the outer pore are critical
for dhp and ca2ⴙ binding. a comparison of the amino
acid sequences in the outer pore segments of each repeat of
the ca2⫹ channel isoforms reveals several residues that are
unique to dhp-sensitive channels and are adjacent to the
ca2⫹ binding glutamate residues in the selectivity filter (fig.
1b). to determine whether these residues are important
dhp- and/or ca2⫹ binding determinants, the mutants
c288a, f1013g, q1018e, q1018m, y1021k, c1319a,
q1326h, and e1327q were constructed and analyzed as
described above and under materials and methods (fig. 4;

modulation of l-type calcium channels by dihydropyridines

ca2ⴙ promotes energetic coupling between
phe-1013 and tyr-1021. qualitatively divergent effects of
ca2⫹ on dhp binding affinity were observed with the mutants f1013g and y1021k (fig. 4; table 2), even though
these two substitutions typically coexist in cav2 channels
within the same nine-amino acid segment of the outer pore
loop of domain iii (fig. 1b). this prompted us to construct a
mutant channel in which phe-1013 and tyr-1021 have been
replaced with glycine and lysine, respectively, resulting in
the double mutant fy/gk. the double mutation causes a
much larger increase in kd1 than either single mutation (fig.
4a; table 2), whereas the values of kc1 and ␣ are intermediate between the two single mutants (fig. 4, b and c; table
2). thus, the parameters for dhp and ca2⫹ binding to
fy/gk differ substantially from the sum of those for the
single mutants, indicating that the two residues interact
energetically in their function as dhp and ca2⫹ binding
determinants.
thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis (carter et al., 1984;
hidalgo and mackinnon, 1995) was used to quantitate the
energetic interaction between phe-1013 and tyr-1021 in
dhp binding (fig. 5). the coupling energy (rtln⍀) between
phe-1013 and tyr-1021 was calculated in nominally zero
ca2⫹ using ␣kd1 values (fig. 5a) and in 1 mm ca2⫹ using
kd1 values (fig. 5b) by subtracting the ⌬⌬g that results
from replacing phe-1013 with glycine in a wild-type background from the ⌬⌬g that results from the same substitution
made in a y1021k background. these analyses demonstrate
that the degree of coupling between phe-1013 and tyr-1021
in dhp binding is highly dependent on the occupancy of the

table 2). c288a, q1018e, q1018m, c1319a, q1326h, and
e1327q have dhp and ca2⫹ binding profiles similar to those
of wild type and are not discussed further.
in contrast to the glutamate mutants, high-affinity binding
of dhp and ca2⫹ is enhanced for mutant f1013g, in which
a glycine conserved in all cav2 channels is substituted for a
phenylalanine residue that is present in all  xxxg310xxx  channels.
kd1 for f1013g is slightly lower than that of wild type (0.22
verses 0.31 nm, respectively), and kc1 for f1013g decreased
2.3-fold from 40 to 17.4 nm (fig. 4, a and b). however, the
most interesting change in the binding profile for f1014g is
the 12.5-fold increase in magnitude of the coupling factor ␣
which results in an 11-fold increase in ␣kd1 compared with
wild type (fig. 4c).
high-affinity binding of dhp and ca2⫹ is also modified for
mutant y1021k, in which a lysine residue found in  xxxg302xxx 
and  xxxg303xxx  channels is substituted for a tyrosine residue
found in all  xxxg310xxx  channels (fig. 4). first, in contrast to
f1013g, kd1 for y1021k is 3-fold larger than kd1 for wild
type (fig. 4a; table 2). second, kc1 for y1021k is more than
30-fold larger than kc1 for wild type (fig. 4b). finally, although the coupling factor ␣ for f1013g is 12.5-fold larger
than that of wild type, ␣ for y1021k is only one-half that of
wild type (fig. 4c).
the results with f1013g and y1021k indicate that nonglutamate residues in the outer pore loop function as important binding determinants for dhps and ca2⫹ ions. the
qualitative differences in the effects of these mutations on
ligand binding suggest that the roles phe-1013 and tyr-1021
play in dhp and ca2⫹ binding are distinct.

pn200-110 binding to its receptor site is driven by a negative change in
gibbs free energy, ⌬g. ⌬g changes for mutant channels whose affinity for
dhp binding is altered and this change in ⌬g, designated ⌬⌬g, is
calculated using the dissociation constants for drug binding to the wildtype and mutant channels, such that ⌬⌬g ⫽ ⫺rtln(kdmut/kdwt), where
r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature in kelvin. ⌬⌬g
values (kilocalories per mole) for each mutant channel are noted by
numbers adjacent to arrows. thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis is
based on the principle that the ⌬⌬g value resulting from the simultaneous alteration of two amino acids is equal to the sum of the ⌬⌬g values
for the individual substitutions that lead to the double mutant. for
example, note in a that the ⌬⌬g for the double mutant fy/gk (⫺1.76
kcal/mol) is equal to the sum of the ⌬⌬g values for the individual steps
that lead to fy/gk [ i.e., {(⫺1.42) ⫹ (⫺0.34)} and {(⫺0.26) ⫹ (⫺1.50)}].
the coupling energy (rtln⍀) between two amino acids can be determined
by calculating the difference between the ⌬⌬g values associated with the
horizontal (or vertical) arrows as described in the text. notice that phe1013 and tyr-1021 are strongly coupled only when a single ca2⫹ ion is
bound to the selectivity filter (also see fig. 2b, vertical box).

selectivity filter by ca2⫹. the coupling energy in nominally
zero ca2⫹ of 0.08 kcal/mol is negligible (fig. 5a). this nearzero coupling energy indicates that, in the absence of ca2⫹
(i.e., state [␣1] of fig. 2b, scheme 1), phe-1013 and tyr-1021
are not energetically coupled. in contrast, the coupling energy between phe1013 and tyr-1021 determined in 1 mm
ca2⫹ is substantial. replacing phe-1013 with glycine is
highly dependent on whether the substitution is placed in a
wild-type backbone (⫹0.22 kcal/mol) versus the y1021k
backbone (⫺1.23 kcal/mol). therefore, when the selectivity
filter is occupied by a single ca2⫹ ion (i.e., state [ca/␣1] of
fig. 2b, scheme 1), phe-1013 and tyr-1021 are strongly
coupled with an energy of 1.45 kcal/mol [(⫹0.22 kcal/mol) ⫺
(⫺1.23 kcal/mol) ⫽ 1.45 kcal/mol]. this “coupled state”, in
which phe-1013 and tyr-1021 are energetically coupled and
a single ca2⫹ ion is bound, may represent a stably blocked,
nonconducting state of the channel, as is addressed in the
discussion below.
the coupling factor ␣ plays an important role in
determining the ca2ⴙ dependence of dhp binding.
the effects of the coupling factor ␣ on the ca2⫹ dependence of
dhp binding to the mutant ca2⫹ channels are illustrated in
fig. 6. these relationships between dhp binding affinity
(kd1⫺1 and ␣kd1⫺1 in nanomolar⫺1) and ca2⫹ concentration
were simulated from the binding model in fig. 2b, scheme 1
and the binding parameters from table 1. the dhp affinity
of e292q is 11-fold less than that of wild type with no ca2⫹
ions bound to selectivity filter, but because of a 3.5-fold
increase in ␣ compared with wild type, the affinity is decreased by only 3-fold when one ca2⫹ ion is bound (fig. 6a).
in contrast to e292q, ␣ values for the other glutamate mutants are smaller than those of wild type (fig. 3). consequently, the increases in dhp affinity upon binding of a

modulation of l-type calcium channels by dihydropyridines

discussion
2⫹

ca binding to the pore of the l-type ca2⫹ channels is
allosterically coupled to dhp binding, which suggests that
the binding of dhps and ca2⫹ promotes reciprocal structural
rearrangements in the outer pore that alter the functional
behavior of the channel. to better understand the roles
amino acid residues residing in the outer pore have on dhp
binding, permeation and gating, the binding properties of 16
mutant ca2⫹ channels were assessed using fig. 2b, scheme
1. in addition to dramatic changes in the dissociation constants for dhp and ca2⫹ binding, we found that the coupling
factor ␣ plays a major role in determining the pharmacological properties of the mutant channels. for example, ␣ for the
nonglutamate mutant f1013g is increased nearly 200-fold,
whereas ␣ for y1021k is only one-half that of wild type.
thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis of these mutants indicates that phe-1013 and tyr-1021 are energetically coupled
only when the outer pore is occupied by a single ca2⫹ ion.
our findings are discussed in the context of current theoretical models for permeation (nonner et al., 1998; boda et al.,
2001; lipkind and fozzard, 2001; wang et al., 2005). we
propose that dhps block monovalent and divalent currents
by stabilizing a nonconducting blocked state that is structurally and functionally analogous to a channel with a single
ca2⫹ ion in its selectivity filter.
binding of dhp antagonists and ca2ⴙ stabilize a
blocked conformation of the outer pore. in the absence
of ca2⫹, the outer pore is held in an open conformation ([␣1])
by electrostatic repulsion between the four glutamate residues of the eeee locus. when a single ca2⫹ ion enters the
selectivity filter, it acts as a countercharge and draws the
four glutamate residues together to form a blockedconformation ([ca/␣1]) (lipkind and fozzard, 2001). according to fig.
2b, scheme 1, dhp binding interacts allosterically with
ca2⫹ to stabilize the blocked conformation, thereby preventing ca2⫹ conductance. neutralizing any one of the four glutamate residues would destabilize this blocked conformation

by reducing the magnitude of the attractive forces between
the bound ca2⫹ ion and the partially neutralized selectivity
filter. in fig. 3, the kd1 values for the glutamate-to-glutamine mutants are all larger than that of wild type. we
postulate that neutralization of the residues in the selectivity
filter would destabilize the open conformation of the outer
pore as well, because the magnitude of the repulsive forces
between the four glutamate residues would be decreased.
the simulations in fig. 6 show reduced dhp binding in the
absence of ca2⫹, indicating that this postulate holds true.
introduction of positively charged lysine residues
mimics binding of ca2ⴙ. replacing the substituted glutamine residues with positively charged lysine residues
would be expected to partially mimic a ca2⫹ ion by acting as
a countercharge in the selectivity filter. if the charge-reversal substitutions were to perfectly mimic a single bound ca2⫹
ion in the pore, ␣kd1 would equal kd1, and the coupling
factor ␣ would equal 1. we were pleased to find that the
charge-reversal substitutions did follow this predicted trend,
but as might be expected, inserting a lysine with a valence of
only ⫹1 into a constrained position in the selectivity filter
does not perfectly mimic a free divalent ca2⫹ ion in the pore.
the affinity for dhp binding in nominal ca2⫹ (i.e., 1/␣kd1) to
e292k and e1014k membranes is 3- and 2-fold higher than
their charge-neutralized counterparts (fig. 6). these findings indicate that the introduction of a positive charge in the
selectivity filter makes the [␣1] state of the outer pore behave
more like the ca2⫹-bound [ca/␣1] state.
the charge-reversal mutants are still sensitive to ca2⫹,
but the -fold change in binding affinity that occurs as the
channel transitions from [␣1] to [ca/␣1] (i.e., the coupling
factor ␣) is reduced. this reduction occurs because replacing
the neutral glutamine residues with positively charged lysine
residues introduces repulsive forces between the positively
charged amine of the lysine residue and the incoming ca2⫹
ion. consequently, ␣ values for e292k and e1014k are decreased 8.5- and 3.3-fold compared with their glutaminesubstituted counterparts. the combined effects on ␣kd1 and
␣ indicate that the introduction of a positive charge in the
pore partially mimics a single ca2⫹ ion coordinated in the
selectivity filter.
mechanism for dhp action. the cooperativity between
dhp and ca2⫹ binding suggests that dhps modulate channel gating by promoting conformational changes in the outer
pore. we used a “volume exclusion/charge neutralization”
model to explain the reduced conductance of ba2⫹ but not
ca2⫹ through the pores of  xxxg304xxx  correlates of f1013g,
y1021k, and fy/gk (wang et al., 2005). the crystal diameters of ca2⫹ and na⫹ ions are nearly identical (2.00 versus
2.04 å, respectively), yet each ca2⫹ ion carries twice as much
countercharge as a na⫹ ion. therefore, ca2⫹ binds tightly to
the selectivity filter because it is able to neutralize the highly
charged eeee locus without overcrowding it with counterions. ba2⫹ and ca2⫹ ions carry the same charge, but the ionic
diameter of ba2⫹ is approximately 36% larger than that of
ca2⫹. thus, ba2⫹ ions exhibit a higher degree of crowding,
lower binding affinity and consequential faster exit rate (i.e.,
larger conductance) than ca2⫹ ions. these results suggest
that ba2⫹ conductance is reduced because ba2⫹ ions in mutant pores are less prone to overcrowding (wang et al., 2000).
according to fig. 2b, scheme 1, ca2⫹ and dhp binding
shifts the configuration of the outer pore from an open state

single ca2⫹ ion to these mutants are much less than for
e292q or wild type, as illustrated for e292k in fig. 6a. in
the absence of ca2⫹, the dhp binding affinity for mutants
e1014k and e1014q are nearly identical to that of wild type
(fig. 6b). increasing ca2⫹ concentration has even less effect
on dhp binding for e1014q and e1014k (fig. 6b) than for
e292q (fig. 6a).
the largest change in the magnitude of ␣ was observed
with mutant f1013g, whose value for ␣ is 12.5-fold greater
than that of wild type (table 2). although the affinity of
mutant f1013g for dhps is more than 11-fold lower than
wild type in the absence of ca2⫹, there is little difference in
dhp binding affinity between wild type and f1013g when
one ca2⫹ ion is bound (fig. 6c). in contrast, the affinity for
dhp binding of y1021k is similar to wild type in the absence
of ca2⫹ but 3-fold less than wild type when one ca2⫹ ion is
bound. this difference in the effect of ca2⫹ on dhp binding
to f1013g and y1021k results from the 12.5-fold increase in
␣ observed for f1013g compared with the 2-fold decrease in
␣ for y1021k. overall, these comparisons illustrate that the
coupling factor ␣ is a key determinant of the effect of ca2⫹ on
dhp binding and of dhp affinity under physiological conditions.

to a blocked state. [␣1] or [2ca/␣1] are designated as conducting states in fig. 2b, scheme 1, because they represent
channels conducting monovalent and divalent currents, respectively. the blocked state, [ca/␣1], is designated as a
nonconducting state because single ca2⫹ ions are known to
block both monovalent and divalent (i.e., ba2⫹) currents
(almers et al., 1984; hess and tsien, 1984; hille, 2001). here,
we combine the volume exclusion/charge neutralization
model with fig. 2b, scheme 1, and propose that dhps block
mono- and divalent currents through the open [␣1] and [2ca/
␣1] states of the outer pore by stabilizing a nonconducting
blocked state that is structurally and functionally analogous
to [ca/␣1].
this postulate is consistent with the structural model of
lipkind and fozzard (2001). in this model, the eight carboxyl
groups from the eeee locus are thought to form three binding sites: a central high-affinity divalent cation binding site
formed by four carboxyl groups flanked by two low-affinity
sites, each composed of two carboxyl groups (lipkind and
fozzard, 2001). divalent cation permeation through such a
pore would depend on the occupancy of the two low-affinity
sites, thus producing a conducting state ([2ca/␣1]). ion permeation would be prevented if the central, high-affinity site
were occupied by a single ca2⫹ ion, thus producing a nonconducting state ([ca/␣1]). in the absence of divalent cations,
repulsive forces in the eeee locus would open the pore to
greater than 4 å and allow the passage of monovalent cations
through the pore, thus producing a conducting state for
monovalent cations ([␣1]).
given this scenario, the outer pore of an activated channel
would switch between conducting ([2ca/␣1]) and nonconducting, blocked ([ca/␣1]) states. the overall open probability of a
channel would be determined by the probability that the
inner gate is open and the probability that the channel is not
in state [ca/␣1], which is dependent on the dwell time of the
single blocking ca2⫹ ion residing in the selectivity filter. we
propose that dhp antagonists increase this dwell time and
that the open probability of the channel decreases as a consequence. it will require single-channel measurements to
determine whether the mean open times decrease in the
presence of dhp antagonists. such experiments are very
challenging using  xxxg310xxx  channels, so this hypothesis will be
tested using the cardiac  xxxg304xxx  channel.
energetic coupling mediated by bound ca2ⴙ. the
conformational changes that underlie the transitions between the open and blocked states of the outer pore and
modulate dhp binding affinity are dependent on the magnitude of the coupling factor ␣. we used thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis to assess the transition of the outer pore
between the open and blocked states, [␣1] and [ca/␣1], respectively. our results demonstrate that phe-1013 and tyr1021 are strongly coupled only when the selectivity filter is
occupied by a single ca2⫹ ion and not when the selectivity
filter is unoccupied by ca2⫹ (fig. 2b, scheme 1, box). it
seems that the bound ca2⫹ ion serves to mediate energetic
coupling between these two aromatic amino acid residues,
which are located on either side of glu-1014 (fig. 1). this
coupling may result from electronic interactions between the
two aromatic residues through the bound ca2⫹ ion, structural rearrangements in the selectivity filter caused by ca2⫹
binding, or both. we postulate that phe-1013 and tyr-1021
are energetically coupled when the pore is in a blocked,

modulation of l-type calcium channels by dihydropyridines

nonconducting state, and that dhp antagonists block the
channel by stabilizing this same nonconducting conformational state. the positive energetic coupling between phe1013 and tyr-1021 revealed here is likely to make a major
contribution to the stability of this ca2⫹-bound, blocked
state.
