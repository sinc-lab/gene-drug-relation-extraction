the inhibition of a newly cloned coral carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx ) has been investigated with a
series of sulfonamides, including some clinically used derivatives (acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx ,  xxxd307xxx , and sulpiride, or indisulam, a
compound in clinical development as antitumor drug), as well as the sulfamate antiepileptic topiramate.
some simple amino-/hydrazine-/hydroxy-substituted aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides have also been
included in the study. all types of activity have been detected, with low potency inhibitors (kis in the
range of 163–770 nm), or with medium potency inhibitors (kis in the range of 75.1–105 nm), whereas
 xxxd2058xxx , several clinically used sulfonamides and heterocyclic compounds showed stronger
potency, with kis in the range of 16–48.2 nm. these inhibitors may be useful to better understand the
physiological role of the stylophora pistillata ca (stpca) in corals and its involvement in biomineralisation in this era of global warming.

1. introduction
carbonic anhydrases (ca,  xxxg287xxx ) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into
bicarbonate and protons: co2 + h2o, hco3  + h+. there are at
least ﬁve classes of cas with polyphyletic origin1–6: the a-class
(in vertebrates, invertebrates, bacteria and some chlorophytes),
the b-class (in eubacteria and chlorophytes), the c-class (archea
and some eubacteria), and the d- and f-family (present only in
marine diatoms). among numerous roles in physiological processes, the cas are involved in biomineralization from invertebrates to vertebrates, although the ensuing mechanisms are
poorly understood at this moment.7–11
scleractinian corals are the major biomineralizing organisms
which precipitate an aragonitic calcium carbonate (caco3) skeleton. as early as 1959, goreau7 showed the ﬁrst evidence of the
involvement of ca in coral calciﬁcation. indeed, he demonstrated
that the sulfonamide ca inhibitor acetazolamide reduces calciﬁcation rates, suggesting that the enzyme has a role in removing carbonic acid (i.e, protons) from the skeletogenic site during the
calciﬁcation process.7 since then, numerous authors have observed
that ca inhibitors decrease calciﬁcation rates, being thus suggested

that these enzymes are involved in the inorganic carbon supply
for calciﬁcation and/or the regulation of ph at the calciﬁcation
site.12–15 all subsequent studies have then conﬁrmed that sulfonamides (acetazolamide or  xxxd2058xxx  were the only compounds
used so far) signiﬁcantly inhibit calciﬁcation up to 73%.12–16
we have recently cloned, sequenced and localized an a-ca from
the scleractinian coral stylophora pistillata, which has been named
stpca.17 we have demonstrated that stpca is a secreted isoform
and, due to its speciﬁc secretion by the calicoblastic calcifying ectoderm, it was proposed that this enzyme plays a direct role in biomineralization. furthermore, we performed the ﬁrst study on the
inhibition, by simple anions such as halides, bicarbonate, sulfate,
cyanide, azide, etc., of an invertebrate ca at the molecular level.18
from these studies it appeared that stpca has a catalytic activity
for the co2 hydration reaction similar to that of the extracellular
secreted human (h) isoform hca vi. indeed, stpca is less effective
as a catalyst for the co2 hydration reaction, as compared to the
very rapid isozymes hca ii (cytosolic) or hca ix (transmembrane),
among the 16 different mammalian ca isoforms known so far, ca
i–xv.5,19,20
sulfonamides are the most important class of ca inhibitors.
however, even if numerous pharmacological studies with  xxxd2058xxx  or acetazolamide have been performed on living corals to
determine the potential role on ca in calciﬁcation, as outlined
above,7,12–16 inhibition studies with sulfonamides on puriﬁed such
enzymes have never been reported up to now. the present work is
aimed at determining the inhibition proﬁle of recombinant stpca

2.2. ca inhibition data
ca activity and inhibition assays with sulfonamides were
performed on coral recombinant stpca obtained as described
earlier..17 as reported, our stpca preparation showed a moderatehigh catalytic activity for the co2 hydration reaction, with a kcat
of 3.1  105 s1 and kcat/km of 4.6  107 m1 s1 at ph 7.5 and
20 °c, that is, of the same order of magnitude as the hca vi.27 inhibition data of stpca with sulfonamides 1–22 and the 15 clinically
used compounds  xxxd810xxx –sac are shown in table 1, together with
hca i, hca ii and hca vi inhibition data (for comparison purposes).
the following sar should be noted regarding data of table 1
(i) a ﬁrst group of compounds, including derivatives 1–4, 11,
12, 20–22, dcp, slp, ind and zns, showed medium-low potency
as stpca inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of
163–770 nm. these compounds mainly include simple benzenemono- and 1,3-di-sulfonamide derivatives (1–4, 11, 12, 20–22,
and dcp).
(ii) a second group of compounds, such as 5–10, 13, and 14
showed better stpca inhibitory properties compared to derivatives mentioned above, with inhibition constants in the range of
75.1–105 nm. most of these compounds were again simple

data of isoforms i and ii are from ref. 20 whereas data of hca vi from ref. 27.

benzenesulfonamide derivatives possessing either the 4-aminoalkyl- or 3-halogeno-4-amino-substitutions. it should be noted that
halogeno (bromo- , iodo-, ﬂuoro- and chloro-) sulfanilamides 7–10
showed the same inhibitor effect on stpca. the other compounds
possessing this type of activity were 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide derivatives (13 and 14).
(iii) a third group of compounds showed much stronger stpca
inhibitory activity than the previously discussed sulfonamides,
with kis in the range of 16–48.2 nm. among these compounds,
there were the heterocyclic derivatives 15–18, together with all
the clinically used compounds except dcp, slp, ind and zns,
which, as shown above, behave as weaker stpca inhibitors. the
most effective inhibitors were acetazolamide  xxxd810xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx 
dza (kis of 16 nm and 18.1, respectively).
(iv) only one compound, the benzene sulfonamide derivative 19
was ineffective on stpca with a ki about 2.5 lm.
(v) it may be observed that stpca has a completely different
inhibition proﬁle when compared to the cytosolic human isozymes
hca i and ii or the secreted isozyme, hca vi. indeed, heterocyclic
sulfonamides ( 13, 14) are more effective inhibitors of stpca
(100 nm) than hca vi ((750 nm). furthermore, the most potent
inhibitors of hca vi (brz and slp) were very much less effective
on stpca (53 and 537 times less potent, respectively). in the same
manner, dcp was about 6 times less effective on stpca compared
to hca vi. on the contrary, the hydroxy-/carboxy-substituted
derivative 20 was 8.67 times more effective on stpca than on
hca vi. it is also surprising that aminobenzolamide 15, which is
a very potent inhibitor of the cytosolic isozymes i and ii, showed
rather weak inhibitory properties against both secreted hca vi
and stpca.
saccharin sac, an intramolecularly acylated sulfonamide
weakly inhibits hca i, hca ii, and hca vi but acts as an effective
stpca inhibitor (40 nm range vs micromolar range against the human isozymes). it should be noted that sac is also less effective on
isoforms hca iii,28 hca ix,29 hca xii.29
in order to try to rationalize the kinetic and inhibition data reported here, an alignment of the amino acid sequences of hcai,
hcaii, stpca and hcavi is shown in figure 2. the zn(i) ion of
cas is essential for catalysis.19,20 sulfonamides bind in a tetrahedral geometry of the zn(ii) ion, in deprotonated state, with the
nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide moiety coordinated to zn(ii).20
furthermore, the aromatic/heterocyclic part of the inhibitor interacts with hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues of the active site
cavity. similarly to all human cas, stpca has the three conserved
histidine residues acting as zn(ii) ligands, that is, his114, his116
and his139 (corresponding to his94, his96 and his119 of hca ii).
furthermore, the proton shuttle residue (his64, hca ii numbering)
is also identical in the human and coral enzymes (residue his86 in
stpca). identical are also the gate-keeper residues of the two enzymes (glu106–thr199, hca ii numbering, corresponding to
glu126–thr221 in stpca), which orient the substrate (co2) for
the nucleophilic attack by the zn(ii) hydroxide species of the enzyme. in addition to previously mentioned amino acids (his94,
his96, his119, his64, glu106 and thr199) which interact with sulfonamides, residues 92 and 131 are known to be involved in the
binding of many sulfonamide/sulfamate inhibitors.19 it should be
noted that residue 131 (hcaii numbering) is different in all compared cas shown in figure 2, and may be one of the factors explaining the rather diverse inhibition proﬁles of these enzymes with
sulfonamides/sulfamates.
in addition, in figure 2, other differences between the sequence
of the four cas considered here are emphasized and may explain
the differences in inhibition proﬁles by the sulfonamides observed
in this study. amino acids identical in hca ii, hca vi and stpca, but

range of response obtained for these cas, and shaded with the
same color in table 1. amino acids identical in hca ii and stpca
are boxed in dark gray and may explain the same identical inhibitory response of sulfonamides against these two cas. for sequences which are different in all four cas (white box), one may
assume this to reﬂect that the sulfonamide inhibitory response is
different for these diverse cas.
3. conclusion
a series of sulfonamides/sulfamate has been tested for interaction with the catalytic domain of the coral enzyme stpca. they include clinically used drugs, as well as the sulfamate antiepileptic
topiramate. all types of activity have been detected for this class
of ca inhibitors, with many low (kis in the range of 163–770 nm)
and medium potency inhibitors (kis in the range of 75.1–105 nm)
being detected. sulfonamides such as  xxxd2058xxx , and several
clinically used sulfonamides together with heterocyclic compounds showed stronger potency against stpca, with kis in the
range of 16–48.2 nm. one compound, saccharin (sac), showed an
excellent selectivity against stpca over all tested human isoforms
(selectivity ratios in the range of 23–460). contrary to anion inhibition studies, the sulfonamide inhibition study presented here
showed that stpca and the secreted hca vi (with which the coral
enzyme shows a high degree of homology as well as the extracellular secretion feature) possess different inhibitory response pro-

ﬁles. further studies, employing a collection of puriﬁed stpca
mutant proteins, will be necessary to determine the binding properties to the different sulfonamides. furthermore, based on the
inhibitory data obtained in this paper, a study on living coral will
be done to characterize the properties of the different sulfonamide
on 45ca-monitored calciﬁcation and consequently the role of
stpca in coral biomineralization. such studies are critical for better understanding this crucial process of biomineralization in the
era of global warming when excessive co2 amounts are present
in the atmosphere and sea water.
4. experimental
4.1. chemistry
buffers and chemicals, including all clinically used sulfonamides/sulfamate ( xxxd810xxx –sac), were from sigma–aldrich, merck or
johnson & johnson, being of highest purity available, and were
used without further puriﬁcation. compounds 1–6, 11, 12, 18,
and 22 are commercially available (sigma–aldrich), whereas 7–
10,21 13–1722, 19,23 20,24 and 21,25 were prepared as reported earlier by this group.
4.2. ca catalytic/inhibition assay
an sx.18mv-r applied photophysics (oxford, uk) stopped-ﬂow
instrument has been used to assay the catalytic/inhibition of vari-

ous ca isozymes as reported by khalifah.30 phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) has been used as indicator, working at the
absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4) as
buffer, 0.1 m na2so4 or naclo4 (for maintaining constant the ionic
strength; these anions are not inhibitory in the used concentration),18 following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration reaction for a
period of 5–10 s. saturated co2 solutions in water at 25 °c were
used as substrate. stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared at
a concentration of 10 mm (in dmso–water 1:1, v/v) and dilutions
up to 0.01 nm done with the assay buffer mentioned above. at
least 7 different inhibitor concentrations have been used for measuring the inhibition constant. inhibitor and enzyme solutions
were preincubated together for 10 min at room temperature prior
to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the e–i complex.
triplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration,
and the values reported throughout the paper are the mean of such
results. the inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear leastsquares methods using prism 3, as reported earlier,21,25 and represent the mean from at least three different determinations. mammalian27–29 and coral17,18 ca isozymes were prepared in
recombinant form as reported earlier by our groups.
