the (r)-(+ )- and (s)-(— )-enantiomers of the anticholinergic compound,  xxxd2816xxx , were syn-
thesized from (r)-(—)- and (s)-(+ )-2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy- xxxd310xxx , respectively. the
potencies of the enantiomers were compared using a cholinergic receptor binding assay. the (r)-(+)-
enantiomer inhibited binding 29 times more potently than the (s)-(— )-enantiomer.

key words:  xxxd2816xxx ; enantiomers; anticholinergic; antimuscarinic activity.

introduction

 xxxd2816xxx  hydrochloride [(+)-1-methyl-
1,4,5,6 - tetrahydro - 2 - pyrimidylmethyl 2 - cyclohexyl - 2 -
hydroxy-2-phenylethanoate hydrochloride] is an antimusca-
rinic agent used in racemic form in the treatment of gastro-
intestinal and genitourinary disorders (1). in the related
anticholinergic drugs,  xxxd3019xxx  and trihexyphenidyl hy-
drochloride, as well as in a series of other substituted 1-cy-
clohexylbenzyl alcohols that possess anticholinergic ac-
tivity, the (r)-enantiomers are more potent than the (s)-en-
antiomers (2—8). we have synthesized both the (r)- and the
(s)-enantiomer of  xxxd2816xxx  (9), and their relative
potencies are described here.

mogenized in so mm tris—acetate buffer (ph 7.4) using a
polytron (setting 6, 30 sec). the homogenate was centri-
fuged (30.000g, 30 min), the pellet resuspended in fresh
buffer, and the process repeated. aliquots of 800 wl of the
final homogenate were mixed with 100 wl of buffer con-
taining 3h-qnb, and 100 pl of buffer, or buffer containing a
drug. the final ligand concentration was 0.1 nm, and the
final tissue concentration was 10 mg wet wt/ml. the mixture
was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr and then fil-
tered. the radioactivity trapped on the filters was measured
by scintillation counting. nonspecific binding was defined as
that occurring in the presence of a 1 um concentration of
atropine.

results

synthesis

the (r)-(+)- and (s)-(— )-enantiomers of oxyphencycli-
mine were synthesized using (r)-(—)- and (s)-(+)-2-cyclo-
hexyl-2-hydroxy- xxxd310xxx  as the chiral
synthon essentially as previously described (9) except for
using (—)-ephedrine as the resolving agent for the (r)-enan-
tiomer of the chiral synthon. the stereochemical purity of
(s)-(—)- xxxd2816xxx  hydrochloride was examined by
the addition of a chiral solvating agent to the 'h nmr solu-
tion according to the method of pirkle et al. (11,12); the ap-
plicability of the method for  xxxd2816xxx  hydrochlo-
ride has been described in ref. 9. detectable amounts of
(r)-(+)- xxxd2816xxx  hydrochloride were not re-
vealed. this fact, together with the nearly coinciding numer-
ical values of rotations, suggests that the samples employed
in the present study are of a high optical purity. previously
reported values are slightly higher (ca. 9.6° vs ca. 8.9° for the
present samples), presumably because of differences in tem-
peratures, concentrations, and instrumental conditions (dif-
ferent polarimeter).  xxxd2816xxx  hydrochloride ap-
pears (9) to crystallize as a conglomerate from ethanol, elim-
inating the requirement of having a strictly pure chiral
synthon, 2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy- xxxd310xxx .

biological evaluation

the relative anticholinergic potencies of the enan-

237

tiomers of  xxxd2816xxx  were inferred from their abili-
ties to inhibit binding of the muscarinic ligand 7h-qnb to
bovine cortex (13,14). ics) values of the muscarinic antago-
nists, atropine and scopolamine, determined by our assay
(table i) agreed with those reported in the literature (14)
using a similar concentration of 7h-qnb. both enantiomers
of  xxxd2816xxx  also inhibited muscarinic binding, al-
though less potently than atropine or scopolamine. the
(r)-(+)-enantiomer was 29 times more potent than the
(s)-( — )-enantiomer.

discussion

the present results are consistent with earlier observa-
tions that in substituted 1-cyclohexylbenzyl alcohols with
anticholinergic properties, the greater activity lies in the en-
antiomer with the (r)-configuration. thus, the potencies of
the (r)-enantiomers of  xxxd3019xxx  and trihexyphenidyl hy-
drochloride are 380 and 5.5 times, respectively, greater than
those of the (s)-enantiomers (6,7). furthermore, potency
differences within this range have been reported for other
substituted 1-cyclohexylbenzyl alcohols that exhibit anti-
cholinergic activity (2—5). in the case of  xxxd2816xxx ,
the (r)-(+ )-enantiomer is 29 times more potent in inhibiting
muscarinic receptor binding than the (s)-(— )-enantiomer.
