abstract
 xxxd2956xxx  is an antipsychotic agent also used to treat facial tics.  xxxd2956xxx  can cause acquired long qt syndrome and ventricular
arrhythmias. to elucidate the mechanism behind these clinical findings, we examined the effects of  xxxd2956xxx  on the cloned human
cardiac kq channels  xxxg1246xxx  ž human ether-a-go-go-related gene; rapid component of delayed rectifier.,  xxxg1234xxx  žultra-rapid delayed
rectifier. and kvlqt1rmink žslow component of delayed rectifier.. using patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that  xxxd2956xxx  was a
potent inhibitor of  xxxg1246xxx  displaying an ic 50 value of 18 nm. in contrast,  xxxd2956xxx  ž10 mm. was a weak inhibitor of kvlqt1rmink and
 xxxg1234xxx . we conclude that  xxxd2956xxx  is a specific, high affinity antagonist of  xxxg1246xxx , and that this interaction leads to prolongation of
cardiac repolarization. q 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
acquired or drug-induced long qt syndrome can be a
dangerous side effect that is associated with certain prescription medications. this pro-arrhythmic activity is characterized by a prolongation of the qt interval on the
electrocardiogram, and can lead to the life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes žben-david and
zipes, 1993.. one mechanism by which drugs can prolong
cardiac repolarization is by blocking one or more types of
voltage-dependent kq channels in the myocardium. advances in molecular biology have lead to the discovery and
cloning of several distinct kq channels that contribute to
repolarization of the human myocardium.  xxxg1234xxx , for example, is the kq channel protein that is thought to underlie
the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier kq current ž i kur . found in
the human atria žfedida et al., 1993.. this channel is also
found in the ventricular myocardium, but its role there is
as yet unknown žmays et al., 1995.. the human ether-ago-go-related gene,  xxxg1246xxx , expresses the rapid component

mv from a holding potential of y80 mv was followed by

2.2. electrophysiology
cells expressing the cloned human kq channels were
seeded on glass or plastic coverslips 24–48 h before use.
 xxxg1246xxx  and kvlqt1rmink currents were recorded using
the whole-cell patch clamp configuration, while  xxxg1234xxx 
currents, due to the high expression levels of this channel
in this cell line, were recorded from cell-free inside-out
membrane patches žhamill et al., 1981; rampe et al.,
1998.. electrodes ž2–5 m v resistance. were fashioned
from tw150f glass capillary tubes žworld precision instruments, sarasota, fl.. for whole-cell recordings, electrodes were filled with the following solution žin mm.:
potassium aspartate, 120; kcl, 20; na 2 atp, 4.0; hepes,
5.0; mgcl 2 , 1.0; ph 7.2 with koh. this served as the
external solution for the inside-out patch experiments. the
external solution for whole-cell recordings contained žin
mm.: nacl, 130; kcl, 5; sodium acetate, 2.8; mgcl 2 , 1.0;
hepes, 10; glucose, 10;  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 1.0; ph 7.4 with naoh.
this served as the internal solution for the inside-out patch
recordings. cells on coverslips were placed in a 0.5-ml
chamber. cells were continuously perfused with external
solution, or external solution containing various concentrations of  xxxd2956xxx , at a rate of 3 ml per min. currents were
recorded at room temperature using an axopatch 1-d or
axopatch 200 b amplifier žaxon instruments, burlingame,
ca. and were conditioned by a four-pole low pass filter
with a cutoff frequency of between one-quarter to one-half

mozide had no detectable effect on tail current kinetics. in
separate experiments, when cells were returned to a potential of y100 mv, inward  xxxg1246xxx  tail currents decayed with
a time constant of 95 " 12 ms ž n s 5.. this value was not
significantly altered in the presence of 30 nm  xxxd2956xxx 
and measured 104 " 11 ms ž n s 5.. the effects of  xxxd2956xxx  were not reversible upon washing the cell with
drug-free solution for several minutes.
fig. 2 shows the effects of  xxxd2956xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  currents
during more prolonged voltage steps. current was activated by 6 s depolarizations to q20 mv from a holding
potential of y80 mv. following several depolarizing
pulses, the cell was held at y80 mv for 3 min while 300
nm  xxxd2956xxx  was allowed to wash in. the first pulse after
this equilibration period showed a reduction in peak current as well as an additional time-dependent block of the
current, which developed over the course of the depolarizing step žfig. 2.. single exponential fit of this block
yielded a time constant of 2.01 " 0.28 s ž n s 5.. subsequent depolarizing pulses delivered at 45-s intervals showed
little or no time-dependent component of block, suggesting
that  xxxd2956xxx  had not dissociated to any great extent from
the channel during the inter-pulse interval.
we also examined the effects  xxxd2956xxx  on two other
cloned human cardiac kq channels, kvlqt1rmink which
underlies i ks in the human heart and  xxxg1234xxx  which underlies i kur . kvlqt1rmink currents were elicited by 4-s
depolarizing pulses to q20 mv from a holding potential
of y80 mv. current measured at the end of these pulses
was reduced by 27 " 5% ž n s 5. by 10 mm  xxxd2956xxx .

fig. 2. effects of  xxxd2956xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  during prolonged depolarizations.
whole-cell  xxxg1246xxx  channel currents were elicited by 6-s depolarizations
to q20 mv from a holding potential of y80 mv. after control pulses
were obtained, the cell was exposed to  xxxd2956xxx  for 3 min without
pulsing the cell. the first pulse following this equilibration period is
pictured and showed a reduction in peak current as well as a time-dependent component of block that developed during the course of the pulse.

 xxxg1234xxx  currents were elicited from inside-out membrane
patches by 1-s depolarizations to q50 mv from a holding
potential of y80 mv žrampe et al., 1998..  xxxg1234xxx  current
measured at the end of these pulses was reduced by
29 " 6% ž n s 5. by 10 mm  xxxd2956xxx . this drug concentration was the highest obtainable due to solubility limitations.

4. discussion
this report is the first to detail the effects of the
neuroleptic agent  xxxd2956xxx  on voltage-dependent kq
channels cloned from the human heart. we found that
 xxxd2956xxx  was a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1246xxx  channel currents
displaying an ic 50 value of 18 nm. significant inhibition
of current was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nm.
during prolonged depolarizing pulses to q20 mv,  xxxd2956xxx  was shown to enhance the rate of  xxxg1246xxx  current
decay suggesting some interaction with an activated state
of the channel. however, since peak current was also
reduced, we do not exclude a further interaction of the
drug with the closed state of the channel. the effects of
 xxxd2956xxx  were poorly reversible, suggesting an intracellular site of action for this hydrophobic drug. in contrast
to its effects on  xxxg1246xxx ,  xxxd2956xxx  demonstrated little affinity for kvlqt1rmink or  xxxg1234xxx , inhibiting these channels
by less than 30%  xxxd1891xxx  mm. these results suggest that
 xxxd2956xxx  inhibits  xxxg1246xxx  with high affinity and is selective
for this channel relative to other human cardiac kq channels.
 xxxd2956xxx  has been shown to prolong the qt interval
and may be associated with torsades de pointes type
ventricular arrhythmia žfulop et al., 1987; krahenbuhl et
al., 1995; desta et al., 1999.. qt prolongation has been
observed following therapeutic doses of  xxxd2956xxx , in cases
of overdose, and may be enhanced by agents which slow
its metabolism including macrolide antibiotics žfulop et
al., 1987; krahenbuhl et al., 1995; desta et al., 1999..
recently, the manufacturer of  xxxd2956xxx  has issued a ‘‘dear
doctor’’ letter warning of such interactions žorap: important labeling changes, 1999..  xxxd2956xxx  blocks ca2q
channels in the mid-nanomolar range žluchowski et al.,
1984; enyeart et al., 1990. and this activity has been
suggested as the cause of these ecg changes žfulop et al.,
1987; krahenbuhl et al., 1995.. the data presented here
strongly suggest that the most likely explanation for these
effects is high affinity block of the  xxxg1246xxx  cardiac kq
channel. the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2956xxx  depend on
blockade of the dopamine d 2 receptor that occurs with an
affinity of approximately 3–4 nm žtam and cook, 1984..
thus, concentrations of  xxxd2956xxx  that block dopamine
receptors in vitro are similar to those that also produce
significant reduction in  xxxg1246xxx  channel current.  xxxd2956xxx 
now joins a growing list of drugs including antihistamines

prokinetic agents žmohammad et al., 1997; rampe et al.,
1997. that prolong cardiac repolarization via a high affinity interaction with  xxxg1246xxx . the present report also underscores the dangers of prescribing  xxxd2956xxx  with other
drugs that inhibit  xxxg1246xxx , where additive effects may be
expected to occur.
