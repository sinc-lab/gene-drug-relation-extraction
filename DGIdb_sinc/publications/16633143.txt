background: motor vehicle accidents (mvas) are a leading cause
of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) in the general population.
alterations in norepinephrine and serotonin systems have been
proposed as mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the
condition, with treatment directed at these neurotransmitter
systems.  xxxd3089xxx , a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor,
exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the human norepinephrine
transporter. inasmuch as ptsd may be associated with dysregulation of noradrenergic activity, the present double-blind randomized
clinical trial intended to evaluate  xxxd3089xxx ’s efficacy in the
management of mva-related ptsd and to compare its efficacy
with a medication commonly used in ptsd, the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine.
methods: forty patients with mva-related ptsd attending a local
community mental health outpatient clinic were randomized to
receive a fixed dose of either  xxxd3089xxx  (8 mg/d) or fluvoxamine
(150 mg/d) in a double-blind fashion for a period of 8 weeks.
results: at baseline and at study end point, the 2 subgroups
demonstrated no statistical differences in scores on ptsd,
depression, and anxiety rating scales. both medications led to
significant improvements in all clinical scales measured. nine
patients receiving  xxxd3089xxx  and 3 receiving fluvoxamine withdrew
from the study because of side effects.
conclusions: study observations indicate comparable efficacy of
 xxxd3089xxx  and fluvoxamine in the management of mva-related
ptsd despite  xxxd3089xxx ’s selective noradrenergic activity.  xxxd3089xxx  appears to be at least as effective as fluvoxamine and may
offer an alternative management option in this often difficult-to-treat
and disabling condition. a lower and flexible  xxxd3089xxx  dosing
schedule will be recommended for future research to improve its
tolerability in ptsd patients.

otor vehicle accidents (mvas) are a leading source of
morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide.1 in
the united states, more than 3.5 million people are injured in
mvas every year.2 in israel, data in 1999 reported 22,798
mvas being responsible for 45,503 persons being injured,
including 476 deaths.3 in addition to significant mortality
and medical morbidity rates, mvas can also lead to a wide
range of acute and chronic psychological consequences,4
with mva-related posttraumatic stress disorder (mvarptsd) being the most common.5 most notably, mvas have
been found to be the leading cause of ptsd in the general
population.6 generally, the symptoms of acute response to
stress after mvas resolve within several weeks. however, a
considerable number of persons (10% – 30%) continue to
experience ptsd symptoms for an extensive period.7 – 11
although much is known regarding the demographics
and epidemiology of mvas and subsequent ptsd incurred,
the management of such conditions is often difficult, and
many individuals remain with difficult-to-treat ptsd conditions that may persist in time. the quest for effective
management of ptsd has focused primarily on current
knowledge regarding the biologic etiology of the illness. in
particular, focus has been directed at alterations in noradrenergic and serotonergic systems and the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical axis in ptsd.12 – 15 many of these
studies have focused on hyperarousal systems operating
under conditions of overwhelming stress.16 treatment
strategies of ptsd have traditionally included the use of
tricyclic antidepressants and  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors.17,18 recently, based on their ease of use and often (but
not always) favorable safety profile, the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have been extensively investigated in the treatment of ptsd.19,20 although agents with
predominant activity on the noradrenergic system such as
clonidine and b-blockers have been studied, investigations
on noradrenergic agents remain highly limited.21 the quest
remains for alternative strategies, perhaps involving the
administration of some of the newer-generation antidepressants with more selective sites of action based on the known
pathophysiology of the condition.
 xxxd3089xxx  was the first commercially available
selective norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitor developed
specifically as a first-line therapy for major depressive
disorder. it appears to exhibit high affinity and selectivity for
the human ne transporter compared with its activity at
serotonin and dopamine transporters in central nervous

system targets. it is considered to act by binding to the ne
transporter and blocking reuptake of synaptic ne back into
its terminals.  xxxd3089xxx  appears to have only minimal
sedative and cardiovascular liabilities, with a favorable
sexual and gastrointestinal side effect profile compared with
the ssris.22 because ptsd may be associated with hyperphysiological levels of catecholamines, such as those that
have been noted in serum and urine,15,23,24 a medication with
selective activity at the noradrenergic system may offer
improved efficacy in the management of the condition. more
specifically, if individuals with ptsd exhibit exaggerated
central nervous system responses to noradrenergic stimulation (through antagonism of presynaptic á2 autoreceptors),11
treatment with a substance such as  xxxd3089xxx , which
exhibits ne reuptake inhibitor activity, would be expected
to normalize ne-mediated neuronal signaling. however,
although  xxxd3089xxx  appears to exhibit positive effects after
treatment of patients with depression and those with panic
disorder,25 its efficacy in the management of ptsd remains
unknown.
because  xxxd3089xxx  has never to our knowledge been
investigated in the management of ptsd, the goal of the
present double-blind randomized clinical trial was therefore
to evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  in the management of
mvar-ptsd and to compare its efficacy against the
efficacy of a medication that is well established and
commonly used in the management of the condition, namely
the ssri fluvoxamine.26 – 28

method
participants
study participants were persons who experienced
mva and were identified as outpatients attending a local
community mental health outpatient clinic near central
israel. inclusion criteria for study participation required that
subjects met a primary current diagnosis of ptsd according
to the structured clinical interview for axis i dsm-iv
disorders – patient version29 and the clinician-administered
ptsd scale for dsm-iv (caps), part 1.30 all subjects
should have experienced ptsd symptoms for at least 1
month before study recruitment and had a total score of at
least 60 on the first 17 items of the caps, part 2 (caps-2)30
at baseline. subjects with a diagnosis of any dsm-iv axis i
psychiatric disorder (except any mood or anxiety disorder
considered to be comorbid with the primary diagnosis of
ptsd), past or current traumatic brain injury and loss of
consciousness, past or current medical or neurological
illness, past or current alcohol or any other substance abuse,
or current major routine laboratory abnormality were
excluded from study participation. also excluded from the
study were subjects who were involved in any current
litigation or who had been treated with any psychotropic
medication for a period of 2 months before study enrolment.
the details of the study were fully explained to all potential
participants before study commencement. before study
participation, all participants signed a written informed
consent. the study protocol was approved by the ness-ziona
and beer yaakov hospital institutional review board.

study design
after a 7- to 14-day screening and diagnostic
assessment period, during which time no medication was
administered, subjects who met the study inclusion criteria
were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to
8 weeks of treatment with either  xxxd3089xxx  (n = 20) or
fluvoxamine (n = 20), which were prepared in identically
looking capsules. although it may be suggested that the best
data regarding the use of an ssri in the management of
ptsd have come from studies with sertraline,31 the use of
sertraline in this study was not possible because sertraline
was unavailable for general use in israel at that time. a
computer-generated randomization sequence was used to
determine each patient’s treatment group assignment. subjects who were randomized to receive  xxxd3089xxx  commenced treatment at 8 mg/d (4 mg bid) and remained at this
fixed dosage for the 8-week duration of the study. patients
randomly assigned to fluvoxamine commenced treatment at
150 mg/d (75 mg bid) and also remained at this fixed
dosage for the 8-week duration of the study. emergency
codes, which were generated by a computer drug labeling
system, were available to the principal investigator in case of
a treatment-emergent serious adverse event.

clinical outcome measures
patients were rated at baseline and at study end point
by means of the caps-230 and the clinician-rated
treatment outcome ptsd scale (top-8).32 the baseline
and end point severity of comorbid depressive and anxiety
symptoms was evaluated using the hamilton scale for
depression (ham-d)33 and the hamilton scale for anxiety
(ham-a).34 all rating scales were administered by a trained
research psychiatrist (es) blinded to the medication
condition. each subject was thus evaluated by the same
research physician for the duration of the study to preserve
continuity and uniformity of assessments.

safety assessments
safety assessments were performed at the screening and
study end point visits (or upon study discontinuation) and
included a complete physical examination, electrocardiography, and blood laboratory screen (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis). in addition to screening assessments,
heart rate and blood pressure were evaluated at each weekly
visit (baseline through week-8 visits). in addition, an extensive
side effect rating scale was administered with any adverse
effects that were assessed and recorded in detail ranging from
mild to severe. patient compliance with study medication was
ensured at each visit by means of direct questioning and by
counting of medication capsules.

statistical analysis
the primary outcome measure of the study was the
change (d) from baseline to the week 8 end point (d =
8-week scores  baseline scores) in the caps-2 total score.
secondary outcome measures were changes in the caps-2
intrusive, avoidance, hyperarousal, and top-8 scores. the
baseline psychometric data and the changes in psychometric
evaluations between the 2 groups were analyzed using

unpaired 2-tailed student t test with bonferroni correction
for multiple tests. fisher exact test was used to compare the
categorical data between the subgroups. the baseline versus
end point psychometric data within the subgroups were
analyzed by paired 2-tailed student t test. all results were
expressed as mean ± sd.

results
study sample
the study sample consisted of 40 patients, all of whom
completed the prerandomization assessment phase and were
equally randomized into the double-blind  xxxd3089xxx  (n = 20)
or fluvoxamine (n = 20) treatment phase. no significant
differences between the 2 subgroups were noted with respect
to age ( xxxd3089xxx -treated patients, 37.45 ± 9.1 vs fluvoxaminetreated patients, 42.7 ± 9.3 years; t = 2.02, df = 38, p = 0.07),
length of education (mean,  xxxd3089xxx -treated patients,
12.5 ± 1.9 vs. fluvoxamine-treated patients, 13 ± 2.1 years;
t = 2.02, df = 38, p = 0.4), number of traumatic events
encountered ( xxxd3089xxx -treated patients, 1.2 ± 0.6 vs.
fluvoxamine-treated patients, 1.1 ± 0.4; t = 2.02, df = 38,
p = 0.5), or sex distribution ( xxxd3089xxx -treated patients,
11 men/9 women vs. fluvoxamine-treated patients, 10 men/
10 women; p = 0.7).
there were no differences between the 2 subgroups in
baseline caps-2 total scores ( xxxd3089xxx -treated patients,
74.9 ± 14.9 vs. fluvoxamine-treated patients, 81.8 ± 11.0;
t = 2.02, df = 38, p = 0.1), caps-2 reexperiencing cluster
scores (22.2 ± 4.9 vs. 24.2 ± 3.9; t = 2.02, df = 38, p = 0.1),
caps-2 avoidance cluster scores (30.3 ± 7.0 vs. 32.9 ± 5.8;
t = 2.02, df = 38, p = 0.2), and caps-2 hyperarousal

 xxxd3089xxx  in mvar-ptsd

cluster scores (22.5 ± 4.7 vs. 24.7 ± 3.9; t = 2.02, df = 38,
p = 0.1).
nine  xxxd3089xxx -treated subjects and 3 fluvoxaminetreated subjects did not complete the study. reasons for early
termination included the respective side effects of  xxxd3089xxx 
(tension, palpitations, insomnia, headache, nausea, and increased sweating) and fluvoxamine (asthenia, headache, constipation, sedation, nausea, and dizziness).
thus, 28 patients (15 men and 13 women) who
completed the 8-week protocol were included in the final study
analysis (table 1). of the 28 subjects, 11 received  xxxd3089xxx 
and 17 received fluvoxamine. no significant differences
between the 2 subgroups were noted with respect to age
( xxxd3089xxx -treated group, 39.7 ± 7.1 vs. fluvoxamine-treated
group, 42.7 ± 9.1 years; t = 2.05, df = 26, p = 0.3) or sex
distribution ( xxxd3089xxx -treated group, 6 men/5 women vs
fluvoxamine-treated group, 9 men/8 women; p = 0.14). in
addition, no differences were noted between the 2 subgroups
regarding the duration of ptsd symptoms (38.9 ± 86.8 vs.
124.2 ± 157.2 months; t = 2.05, df = 26, p = 0.11) and smoking ( xxxd3089xxx -treated group, 5 smokers/6 nonsmokers vs.
fluvoxamine-treated group, 5 smokers/12 nonsmokers; p = 0.1).

clinical ratings
at baseline, the 2 subgroups demonstrated no statistical
differences in total and subtotal scores on the caps-2, top-8,
ham-d, and ham-a clinical rating scales. notably, both
medications led to highly significant improvements in all
clinical scales measured (table 1). no significant differences were noted between the 2 subgroups in the magnitude of improvement (ds) in total and subscale caps-2 and

(table 1).

adverse effects
side effects, albeit minimal, were experienced with
either study medication. in the  xxxd3089xxx  group, mild side
effects included concentration difficulties, depression, increased sleep duration, emotional indifference, reduced
salivation, palpitations, sweating, pruritus, weight loss, and
increased libido and ejaculatory dysfunction (n = 1); moderate
side effects included nausea and vomiting, constipation, and
erectile dysfunction (n = 1), increased sweating (n = 2),
reduced sleep duration (n = 4), tension (n = 5), and palpitations
(n = 5); severe side effects included nausea and constipation
(n = 1), headache (n = 1), and tension and palpitations (n = 3).
in the fluvoxamine group, mild side effects included reduced
salivation and sedation (n = 1); moderate side effects included
sedation, tension, orthostatis, and weight gain (n = 1), fatigue,
nausea, and vomiting (n = 1), headache (n = 1), and erectile
dysfunction (n = 1); severe side effects included fatigue,
constipation, palpitations, increased sweating (n = 1), and
headache (n = 1).

discussion
study results indicate comparable efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  and fluvoxamine in the management of mvar-ptsd.
this is despite the potential theoretical benefit of  xxxd3089xxx 
over fluvoxamine considering its selective noradrenergic
activity, an effect that is considered to be particularly
important regarding the pathophysiology of ptsd. however,
the study results are significant in that they do indicate that
 xxxd3089xxx  is at least as effective as fluvoxamine in the
management of mvar-ptsd, with both medications indicating highly significant improvements. this finding suggests
that  xxxd3089xxx  may offer an alternative in the management
of this often difficult-to-treat and disabling condition.
in addition, despite the apparent similar efficacy of
 xxxd3089xxx  and fluvoxamine in the management of this
condition, it may be suggested that  xxxd3089xxx  may nevertheless be effective in a subset of ptsd patients, considering its
noradrenergic activity, which exhibits its effect at the core
of the physiological abnormality in ptsd. this is in contrast
to fluvoxamine, which has influences at the serotonergic level
as its primary effect and may secondarily or indirectly affect
the noradrenergic system in the physiological pathway.35,36
furthermore, it may be suggested that the improvement of
ptsd symptoms after treatment with either  xxxd3089xxx  or
fluvoxamine may reflect the interaction between the serotonin
and noradrenergic systems in ptsd that is hypothesized to be
localized at the level of emotional memory encoding.35
it should be noted that an increase in catecholamines in
ptsd has been noted to reflect increases in a range of neurotransmitter substances, including dopamine and ne, in the
csf, serum, and urine.12 – 15,24 thus, it may be hypothesized,
although speculative, that because ptsd has been so strongly
associated with the neurobiology and activation of the
noradrenergic system, including an association with the level
of severity of the illness,12,14 the use of a noradrenergic agent

155

might have particular beneficial effects in the management of
ssri-resistant ptsd.
limitations of the study include the relatively small
number of the study sample and the relatively large dropout
rate among  xxxd3089xxx -treated patients, which may be
accounted for by the relatively high daily dose of  xxxd3089xxx 
(8 mg). it may be suggested that future studies be encouraged
to rather use a lower  xxxd3089xxx  dosage and a more flexible
 xxxd3089xxx  dosing schedule that will be better tolerated.
interestingly, a high dropout rate in studies of individuals
with ptsd has also been noted by others.37 in addition, the
study did not include a ‘‘placebo arm.’’ although study
conclusions may report comparable efficacy between treatments with  xxxd3089xxx  and fluvoxamine, because there is no
placebo arm, it cannot be said that either treatment is actually
‘‘effective’’—that is, different from placebo. furthermore, it
should be noted that despite the small sample size, the
magnitude of improvement as assessed by the change in total
caps scores was larger (although not statistically significant) in the fluvoxamine group (fluvoxamine vs  xxxd3089xxx 
45 ± 17 vs. 35 ± 16, respectively, table 1). the power to
obtain a type 2 error in our study is relatively large, that is,
the probability of finding no significant difference where a
significant difference actually exists ( p  0.05) is 0.69.
thus, a larger sample size is essential to obtain sufficient
power for definitive conclusions about the relative efficacy
of the 2 agents and to characterize any factors in ptsd
symptom subsets that appear to respond preferentially to an
agent versus the other.
in conclusion, inasmuch as no differences with respect
to treatment efficacy between  xxxd3089xxx  and fluvoxamine
were noted,  xxxd3089xxx  may be considered as a potential
alternative to the often used ssris in the management of
ptsd. in addition, it may also become a serious consideration in the management of ssri-resistant ptsd. more
research in the context of larger, double-blind, placebocontrolled treatment trials with a flexible dosing schedule is
required to definitively clarify the usefulness, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  in the treatment of ptsd.
