t

he increasing number of people
worldwide with type 2 diabetes
mellitus has major implications
for both health care systems and the
affected individuals, particularly because of the increased potential for
microvascular and macrovascular
complications. results from the
united kingdom prospective diabetes study (ukpds) showed that a reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin
(hba 1c ) reduced the risk of microvascular, and possibly macrovascular, complications and that any reduction in hba1c was beneficial to
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.1-3 the ukpds also found that
type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease characterized by a continuous loss of pancreatic beta -cell
function, regardless of therapy with
diet, insulin, sulfonylurea, or metformin.1,2 treatment of patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus usually advances in a stepwise manner, largely
dictated by the progressive decline of
beta-cell function. treatment begins
with lifestyle intervention consisting
of exercise and diet management,

purpose. the pharmacology and tolerability of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied.
methods. two randomized, single-blind,
placebo-controlled studies were conducted. treatment with oral antidiabetic agents
was stopped 14 days before study initiation. in the first study (study a), eight subjects received placebo, 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and
either 0.4-µg/kg exenatide or placebo five
minutes before a meal combined with liquid acetaminophen (to assess the rate of
gastric emptying) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. in
the second study (study b), subjects received a single s.c. dose of exenatide or placebo on consecutive days. part 1 of study b
used exenatide doses of 0.01 and 0.1 µg/
kg; 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1-µg/kg doses were
given in part 2. after an overnight fast, the
study drug was injected 15 minutes before a meal (part 1) and before a meal
and acetaminophen (part 2). parts 1 and
2 of study b enrolled six and eight patients,
respectively.
results. in both studies, plasma exenatide
pharmacokinetic profiles appeared dose
proportional. exenatide doses of 0.02–0.2

progresses to treatment with one or
two oral antidiabetic agents (oaas),
and culminates with insulin therapy

µ g/kg dose-dependently lowered post-

prandial glucose excursions. exenatide
suppressed postprandial plasma glucagon
and slowed gastric emptying. there were
no serious adverse events and no patient
withdrawals related to treatment. nausea
and vomiting were the most common adverse events and were mild to moderate in
severity at doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2
µg/kg.
conclusion. administration of preprandial exenatide by s.c. injection resulted in
dose-proportional exenatide pharmacokinetics and antidiabetic pharmacodynamic
activity. at doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2
µ g/kg, exenatide dose-dependently reduced postprandial plasma glucose excursion by insulinotropism, suppression of
plasma glucagon, and slowing of gastric
emptying.

quate, with average hba1c values well
above 8%,4 and most of the currently
available therapeutic agents have undesirable metabolic adverse effects,
including weight gain, hypoglycemia,
and edema or fluid retention.5,6
potential new pharmacologic
agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus should ideally not
only treat the hyperglycemia that
characterizes this disease but also exhibit few, if any, of the clinical limitations of currently available drugs.
new agents should preferably also
preserve or enhance beta-cell function,
thereby halting progression of the
disease. one such potential agent is
exenatide, a synthetic form of the 39amino acid peptide  xxxd2076xxx . natural  xxxd2076xxx  was originally isolated
from the salivary secretions of the lizard heloderma suspectum (gila monster).7 in the gila monster,  xxxd2076xxx 
circulates after the animal bites its
prey and may have endocrine functions related to digestion and energy
assimilation.8  xxxd2076xxx  has a 53%
amino acid sequence overlap with
mammalian glucagon-like peptide-1
(glp-1) but is the product of a separate gene, distinct from the proglucagon gene from which lizard glp-1 is
expressed in the gila monster.9 antidiabetic actions of exenatide that are
shared with glp-1 include glucosedependent enhancement of insulin
secretion, glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriately high glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric
emptying (which may be paradoxically accelerated in humans with diabetes), reduction of food intake, and
promotion of beta -cell proliferation
and neogenesis.10-19 some of these antidiabetic actions (e.g., enhancement
of insulin secretion) may be mediated
by exenatide binding to the pancreatic  xxxg899xxx .20 these antidiabetic actions of exenatide, combined
with its robust (>1000-fold) in vivo
potency relative to native glp-1,
make exenatide an attractive potential pharmaceutical agent. the

patients. in study a, patients were
included if they were 35–65 years of
age, were male, and had an hba1c of
8–10% at screening. in study b,
patients were included if they were
18–65 years of age, were male or a
postmenopausal or surgically sterile
female, had an hba1c of 7–12%, and
had a fasting blood glucose concentration of <260 mg/dl at screening.
eligible patients for each study were
required to have type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with diet or oaas or
both for a minimum of six months at
screening. oaa regimens were to
have been stable for at least three
months before screening. in addition, patients must have maintained
a stable weight (±3 kg) for at least
three months before screening and
have no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values (for a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus). the independent institutional
review board (plantation, fl) and
quorum review: an institutional
review board (seattle, wa) approved the protocols (one site for
each study). all patients provided
written informed consent before
study participation. the studies were
conducted in accordance with the
principles described in the declaration of helsinki, including all
amendments through the 1996 south

study design. study a. in this
single-blind, placebo-controlled,
rising-dose study, eight patients received four escalating single doses of
exenatide (amylin pharmaceuticals)
or placebo. patients were instructed
to stop oaa treatment 14 days before day 1 and for the duration of the
study. patients were randomized to
one of four treatment sequences consisting of a single dose of each of the

am j health-syst pharm—vol 62 jan 15, 2005

following: placebo, 0.1 µ g/kg exenatide, 0.2 µg/kg exenatide, 0.3 µg/
kg exenatide, and either 0.4 µg/kg exenatide or an additional dose of placebo (table 1). exenatide was injected
subcutaneously into the anterolateral
aspect of the thigh (injection site was
alternated between left and right
thighs) at approximately 08:00 on
each of the five days the drug was
administered (days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9).
immediately after injection of exenatide, patients received a definedcalorie enteral nutrition formula
(sustacal, mead johnson) (7 kcal/kg)
and liquid acetaminophen (20 mg/
kg) to drink completely within
5 minutes. the rate of appearance of
acetaminophen in the plasma was
used as an indicator of the rate of
gastric emptying.22 patients were given a standardized lunch, when requested, at least eight hours after injection of the study drug and dinner.
on intervening days, a normal
breakfast was also provided. samples
for plasma exenatide measurements
were collected 15 and 5 minutes before study drug administration, then
10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 150
minutes and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, and 15 hours after administration. samples for plasma glucose and
insulin measurements were collected
15 and 5 minutes before study drug
administration, then 10, 20, 30, 45,
60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes and 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after administration. samples for plasma glucagon
measurements were collected 15 and
5 minutes before study drug administration, then 10, 20, 30, 45, 60,
90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after
administration.
study b. this randomized, singleblind, placebo-controlled study consisted of two parts. oaa treatment
was stopped for 14 days before study
day 1 and for the duration of the
study. in part 1, six patients were
randomized to one of three treatment sequences to receive a single
s.c. dose of exenatide (0.01 or 0.1 µg/

dosing days (table 1). after an overnight fast, study drug was injected as
described above 15 minutes before
patients received a defined-calorie
enteral nutrition solution (7 kcal/kg)
at approximately 07:30 on each day
the drug was administered. samples
for plasma glucose measurements
were collected at 15 and 5 minutes
before study drug administration,
then at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, and
300 minutes after drug administration. in part 2, eight patients (none
of whom were enrolled in part 1)
were randomized to one of four
treatment sequences to receive single
s.c. doses of exenatide (0.02, 0.05, or
0.1 µg/kg) or placebo on four consecutive days. after an overnight fast,
study drug was injected as described
above 15 minutes before patients received a defined-calorie enteral nutrition solution (7 kcal/kg) and liquid acetaminophen (20 mg/kg) at
approximately 07:30 each day of
study drug administration. all patients received lunch, dinner, and an
evening snack on each day of the
study. on intervening days, a normal
breakfast was also provided. samples
for plasma exenatide measurements
were collected 15 minutes before
drug administration, then 15, 30, 60,
90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 minutes afterward. samples for plasma

glucose measurements were collected
15 and 5 minutes before drug administration and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
180, 240, and 300 minutes afterward.
samples for plasma acetaminophen
measurements were collected 15
minutes before drug administration,
then 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes
afterward.
in both studies, safety evaluations
were based on reports of treatmentemergent adverse events in response
to nondirected questioning, clinical
laboratory evaluations (hematology,
serum chemistry, urinalysis), vital
signs (blood pressure and pulse rate),
electrocardiograms, and physical examinations of all patients. the intensity of hypoglycemic episodes was
classified as mild to moderate or severe. mild to moderate hypoglycemia was defined as patient-reported
symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia that may have been associated
with a documented plasma glucose
concentration value of <60 mg/dl.
for severe hypoglycemia, patients
were to have required the assistance
of another person to obtain treatment for their hypoglycemia, including i.v. glucose or i.m. glucagon.
quantification of plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon was performed
by esoterix laboratories (calabasas hills, ca) or quest diagnostics

(san juan capistrano, ca) using
well-established methods. plasma
acetaminophen was measured by
quest diagnostics or mds pharma
services (lincoln, ne) with a highperformance liquid chromatography
assay. quantitation of exenatide was
conducted by amylin pharmaceuticals
with an immunoenzymetric assay.23
statistical analyses. in study a, all
patients who received exenatide were
included in the analysis. in study b,
evaluable patients were defined as
those who received at least two doses
and had sufficient data to allow reliable evaluation of the pharmacodynamic parameters. the area under
the concentration–time curve
(auc0–t) was calculated from concentration profiles and logarithmically transformed (base e) before
analysis. baseline-adjusted data were
analyzed without logarithmic transformation for pharmacodynamic parameters relative to the time of dose
administration. pharmacodynamic
analyses were performed using an
analysis of variance (anova) or a
mixed-effect model 24 that included
terms for sequence, period, and
treatment as fixed effects and subjectwithin-sequence as a random effect.
the least-squares means and standard error of means were derived
from the anova or mixed-effect

patients. in study a, 7 of the
8 subjects completed the study.
seven were taking oaas before
screening (six on sulfonylurea, one
on metformin). baseline demographic statistics are provided in table 2. in study b, all 14 patients completed the study; 2 patients in part 1
and 6 in part 2 were taking oaas at
screening (1 receiving sulfonylureas
alone, 2 on metformin alone, and 5
receiving both sulfonylureas and
metformin).
exenatide pharmacokinetics.
plasma exenatide concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner
after single s.c. doses in studies a and
b. in study a, plasma exenatide concentrations appeared to exhibit doseproportional kinetics, reaching peak
concentrations between 2 and
3 hours, and were still detectable
15 hours postdose with doses of
0.2 µg/kg and higher (figure 1a). for
the 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4-µg/kg exenatide doses, the corresponding
geometric mean auc0–15 hr values
were 55,562, 104,225, 144,335, and
205,193 pg • min/ml, respectively.
pairwise comparisons demonstrated
significantly greater auc0–15 hr values
for the 0.4-µg/kg group compared
with all other treatment groups (p ≤
0.02), and plasma exenatide concentrations in all exenatide groups were
significantly greater than those in the
placebo group at all times measured
after exenatide administration (p <
0.0001).
in study b, there was clear differentiation in plasma exenatide concentrations 30 minutes postdose between the three s.c. doses. auc0–5 hr
and maximum concentration(cmax)
were statistically different for all
pairwise comparisons of exenatide
groups with the placebo group (p <

the corresponding geometric mean
auc0–5 hr values were 9,364, 23,224,
and 41,387 pg • min/ml, respectively, and the corresponding geometric
mean cmax values were 45, 109, and
187 pg/ml, respectively. plasma exenatide half-life (t½) and time to
reach maximum concentration (tmax)
were not significantly affected by exenatide dose. mean t½ values ranged
from 3.3 to 4.0 hours, while mean
t max values ranged from 2.1 to
2.2 hours.
pharmacodynamics. in study a,
all doses of exenatide effectively
blunted the initial rise in postprandial plasma glucose, similar to the results in study b, with glucose concentrations peaking between 30 and
45 minutes after the meal (figure
2a). the glucose pharmacodynamic
profiles were similar for all exenatide
doses tested, and all exenatide doses
resulted in significant suppression of
postprandial glucose excursions
compared with placebo (p < 0.05).
within 1.5 to 2 hours, plasma glucose concentrations in all exenatide
groups decreased to below baseline.
in contrast, 5 hours passed before
postprandial plasma glucose concentrations decreased to below baseline
in the placebo group.
in study a, baseline plasma insulin concentrations were similar for
the placebo and exenatide groups

am j health-syst pharm—vol 62 jan 15, 2005

(figure 3a). postprandial plasma insulin concentrations peaked by 2
hours for all treatment groups. by 8
hours after the defined-calorie meal,
plasma insulin concentrations had
returned to near-baseline levels in
the placebo group but remained
above baseline levels for all exenatide
groups.
baseline plasma glucagon concentrations were similar across treatment groups in study a (figure 3b).
by 20 minutes postdose, plasma glucagon concentrations for all exenatide
treatment groups were lower than
those of the placebo group. by
3 hours postdose, plasma glucagon
concentrations in the exenatide
groups were lower than their respective baseline values and at least
45 ng/l lower than the mean glucagon concentration in the placebo
group. all exenatide groups had significantly reduced glucagon auc0–3 hr
values compared with placebo (p ≤
0.0006). the corresponding mean
auc0–3 hr values for the 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-,
and 0.4-µg/kg exenatide groups were
218, 186, 209, and 163 ng • hr/l,
compared with 331 ng • hr/l for placebo. although cmax and tmax tended
to be higher in the placebo group, the
pairwise comparisons between placebo and each exenatide dose were not
significantly different (p > 0.05), except for the comparison of tmax between the placebo and 0.3-µg/kg exenatide groups (p = 0.0213).

gastric emptying. there was a
dose-dependent slowing of gastric
emptying in study b, assessed by decreased mean acetaminophen concentrations (figure 3c). mean plasma
acetaminophen auc0–120 min pairwise
comparisons were significant for the
0.05-µg/kg exenatide group (907 µg •
min/ml) versus placebo (1288 µg •
min/ml) (p = 0.0329) and the 0.1
µg/kg exenatide group (645 µg • min/
ml) versus placebo (p = 0.0011).
the exenatide groups had mean plasma acetaminophen values of 13.8,
11.4, and 7.7 µg/ml for 0.02, 0.05,
and 0.1 µg/kg exenatide, respectively,
compared with 15.6 µg/ml for the
placebo group. mean cmax pairwise
comparisons of acetaminophen were
significant for 0.05 µg/kg exenatide
versus placebo (p = 0.0155) and
0.1 µg/kg exenatide versus placebo
(p = 0.0001).
safety. in study a, a greater frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was reported in the 0.3and 0.4-µg/kg exenatide groups than
in the placebo, 0.1-µg/kg exenatide,
or 0.2-µg/kg exenatide groups. for
patients receiving exenatide doses of
>0.2 µg/kg, a dose-dependent increase in nausea was observed. the
frequency of nausea was 14% (1/7),
13% (1/8), 0% (0/7), 29% (2/7), and
60% (3/5) in the placebo and 0.1-,
0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4-µg/kg exenatide

not associated with changes in standing blood pressure, although slightly
elevated heart rates were noted. the
patient who prematurely discontinued the study had a severe grand mal
seizure on day 2 that was probably
not related to the study drug. this
subject later recalled having similar
episodes before study enrollment
that were not reported to study site
personnel until after the adverse
event.
there were no serious adverse
events in either study and no withdrawals related to exenatide administration in study b. in part 1 of study
b, there were no treatment-emergent
adverse events. in part 2 of study b,
there were no adverse events that led
to premature withdrawal from the
study. the overall frequency of
treatment-emergent adverse events
was no greater in any exenatide
group (0.02 µg/kg, 12.5%; 0.05 µg/
kg, 12.5%; 0.1 µg/kg, 37.5%) than in
the placebo group (37.5%). the most
common treatment-emergent events
in the exenatide groups were mild to
moderate nausea and vomiting,
which occurred in the 0.02- and 0.1µg/kg exenatide groups but not the
0.05-µg/kg group. in the 0.02-µg/kg
group, 1 patient (12.5%) had nausea
and 1 (12.5%) experienced vomiting.
in the 0.1-µg/kg group, 3 patients
(37.5%) developed nausea and 1
(12.5%) experienced vomiting. two
patients (25%) in the placebo group
developed diarrhea. one patient
(12.5%) in the placebo group and 2
(25.0%) in the 0.05-µg/kg exenatide
group experienced headache. one
case of mild hypoglycemia (12.5%)
occurred in the 0.1-µg/kg exenatide
group.

times sampled), demonstrating its
rapid absorption after s.c. injection. in
addition, exenatide was still detectable
in plasma 15 hours after a single s.c.
injection of doses greater than 0.2
µg/kg. this observation confirms the
prolonged half-life of exenatide in
vivo, consistent with its resistance to
degradation by dipeptidyl-peptidase
iv ( xxxg651xxx ) as previously found in
rats.25 this is in sharp contrast to
glp-1, which is rapidly degraded after s.c. injection (half-life, 1–2 minutes) by the  xxxg651xxx  enzyme.26,27 this
observation could also be partially
attributable to extended absorption
of exenatide into the blood from the
s.c. injection site. in normoglycemic
fasted rats, the single-phase decay kinetics of s.c. exenatide (dose range,
approximately 5–560 µg/kg) resulted
in a dose-dependent blood half-life
ranging from 90 ± 3 to 216 ± 13 minutes (mean ± s.d.) that appeared to
be limited by absorption rate.25 in the
current studies, doses of exenatide
0.02 µg/kg or higher reduced postprandial glucose excursion, thus defining the minimally effective exenatide
dose for this action in humans. plasma glucose was dose-dependently
lowered by s.c. exenatide administration during the crucial two hours after a meal. these observations extend
those reported previously that indicate that exenatide reduces plasma
glucose concentrations in the postprandial state in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus.28
exenatide has been reported to
exhibit a number of acute and
chronic actions in animal models
of diabetes that may account for the
glucose-lowering effects observed in
humans. 14 glucose-dependent insulinotropism, glucose-dependent
suppression of glucagon secretion,
and slowing of gastric emptying are
the principal acute actions of exenatide in these animal models. the
chronic effects of exenatide in these
models include reduced food intake,
weight reduction, enhanced insulin
sensitivity, and increased beta-cell mass.

180

chief among the acute mechanisms
of action observed in animal models
of diabetes is glucose-dependent insulinotropism (i.e., amplification of
beta-cell insulin release when glucose
concentrations are above the normal
range but not when glucose concentrations are below the normal range).
the end result of glucose-dependent
insulinotropism is to increase the gain
of glucose–insulin secretion coupling
while maintaining the physiological
glucose-sensing control mechanisms.
this action of exenatide contrasts
with the action of currently available
insulin secretagogues or hypoglycemic agents, such as sulfonylureas,
which increase insulin secretion regardless of glucose concentration29
and thus have a higher potential to
induce hypoglycemia.1
in the current study, plasma insulin concentrations appeared unchanged by administration of exenatide doses of <0.1 µg/kg, rising
postprandially with the same kinetics
as after administration of placebo.
nevertheless, postprandial plasma
insulin levels increased more rapidly
in the exenatide treatment groups
(doses of ≥0.1 µg/kg) than in the placebo group and tended to remain
above baseline for the remainder of
the eight-hour observation period,
hours after the placebo group’s insulin level had returned to baseline.
this continued elevation in insulin
concentrations in the face of lowered, albeit still elevated, ambient
glucose concentrations is consistent
with the glucose-dependent insulinotropic action of exenatide previously observed in other clinical studies.28
exenatide also suppressed postprandial plasma glucagon concentrations
starting at 20 minutes postdose and
extending to the end of the three-hour
observation period. these data confirm the data reported by kolterman et
al.,28 who found that exenatide reduces plasma glucagon concentrations in the postprandial state. currently available insulin secretagogues
and exogenous insulin administra-

am j health-syst pharm—vol 62 jan 15, 2005

tion do not suppress the paradoxical
postprandial rise of glucagon concentrations observed in patients with
diabetes.30 this lack of suppression
results in an inappropriately low
insulin:glucagon ratio in the portal
vein, contributing to sustained rates
of excess hepatic glucose production.31 thus, by virtue of its ability to
enhance endogenous insulin secretion while lowering glucagon secretion, exenatide tends to reestablish a
more physiological and favorable
portal vein insulin:glucagon ratio
compared with currently available
agents.
the data reported here and previously demonstrate a consistent,
dose-dependent slowing of gastric
emptying by s.c. exenatide administration. 28 meal-entrained endogenous enteropancreatic hormones,
such as cholecystokinin, amylin, and
glp-1, slow gastric emptying, attesting to the importance of this
function for overall control of nutrient assimilation. 32 delivery of
nutrients from the stomach to the
small intestine is the rate-limiting
step for glucose absorption from
the gastrointestinal tract and, thus,
is a critical determinant of postprandial glucose excursion. 33 indeed, patients who have undergone
gastrectomy exhibit postprandial
hyperglycemia despite apparently
normal beta-cell function that produces significant postprandial hyperinsulinemia.34 whether gastricemptying rates are slow, normal, or
accelerated in patients with diabetes
without severe autonomic neuropathy is controversial.18 one of the
main confounders in understanding
the pathophysiology of gastric emptying in diabetes is hyperglycemia itself, as elevated glucose concentrations
in nondiabetics slow the gastricemptying rate.35 thus, a “normal”
gastric-emptying rate in the face of
hyperglycemia may be considered
pathophysiologic, as it is relatively
accelerated compared with an expected normal slowing that occurs in

reports

the presence of hyperglycemia. although one mechanism of exenatide
action is to slow gastric emptying,
there was no evidence from a study
examining the effects of 28-day exenatide administration that exenatide
treatment resulted in the induction
or exacerbation of conditions such as
subclinical gastroparesis.23 thus, the
combined actions of exenatide on
postprandial insulinotropism, glucagon suppression, and the slowing of
gastric emptying markedly reduce
postprandial glucose excursions after
exenatide administration.
conclusion
administration of preprandial exenatide by s.c. injection resulted in
dose-proportional exenatide pharmacokinetics and antidiabetic pharmacodynamic activity. at doses
ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 µg/kg, exenatide dose-dependently reduced
postprandial plasma glucose excursion by insulinotropism, suppression
of plasma glucagon, and slowing of
gastric emptying.
