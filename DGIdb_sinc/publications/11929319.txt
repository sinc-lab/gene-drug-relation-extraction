 xxxd3385xxx  is a nonpeptide tyrosine derivative that antagonises platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia (gp iib/iiia) receptors. it is one of three gp iib/iiia antagonists
approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of patients
with acute coronary syndromes. the clinical effect of  xxxd3385xxx  has been shown
in large studies such as prism (platelet receptor inhibition for ischemic syndrome management), prism-plus (prism – patients limited by unstable
signs and symptoms) and restore (randomised efficacy study of  xxxd3385xxx 
for outcomes and restenosis).
 xxxd3385xxx  is administered as an intravenous infusion. volume of distribution
ranges from 21 to 87l, and binding to human plasma proteins is modest at 64%.
metabolism in humans is negligible, and most drug is excreted renally with sys-

temic clearance ranging from 4.8 to 25.8 l/h. renal function may influence the
excretion of  xxxd3385xxx , but concurrent disease or other drugs generally used in
patients with ischaemia seem not to do so.
this review updates what is known about the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3385xxx 
in humans, especially in comparison with the monoclonal antibody against the
iib/iiia receptor,  xxxd53xxx .

1. role of platelet glycoprotein
receptors in platelet function
platelets are activated by several kinds of agonists, for example collagen,  xxxd80xxx 
(adp), thrombin, and thromboxane a2. the final
step for platelet aggregation is the binding of fibrinogen to activated platelets[1] with the membrane bound glycoprotein (gp) complex iib/iiia
being identified as a receptor of fibrinogen.[2] the
iib/iiia receptor changes the spatial orientation of
its extracellular domains during platelet activation,
and the fibrinogen binding site is exposed. since
the binding of fibrinogen to this receptor is a necessary step for normal platelet aggregation with
any inducer, gp iib/iiia receptor inhibiting properties are regarded as targets in suppressing platelet
function.
1.1 discovery and development of  xxxd3385xxx 

in light of the characteristics of gp iib/iiia receptors, ligands for these receptors were investigated and the tripeptide sequence arginylglycyl-aspartyl (rgd) was found to be the minimal
sequence necessary for binding to gp iib/iiia receptors.[2,3] monoclonal antibodies[4,5] or rgdcontaining proteins or peptides derived from the
above results are reported to inhibit iib/iiia receptors.[6,7] since these agents contain various complex
structures beside the minimal rgd sequence, a new
agent with low molecular weight was designed[8]
and was developed as  xxxd3385xxx  ( xxxd3385xxx ). then,
from among iib/iiia receptor antibodies, a chimaeric human-murine monoclonal antibody fab fragment ( xxxd53xxx ) was evaluated and developed as
 xxxd53xxx . both  xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  have

been approved by the us food and drug administration for treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes.
1.2 clinical effects of  xxxd3385xxx 

the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3385xxx  has been demonstrated through large studies such as prism
(platelet receptor inhibition for ischemic syndrome management),[9] prism-plus (prism –
patients limited by unstable signs and symptoms)[10] and restore (randomized efficacy
study of  xxxd3385xxx  for outcomes and restenosis).[11] all these studies were randomised, doubleblinded and placebo-controlled; their design and
outcomes are summarised in table i.
 xxxd3385xxx  tended to reduce negative events, such
as mortality or myocardial infarction (mi) at 2, 7
or 30 days, and 6 months after treatment. in the
prism-plus study,  xxxd3385xxx  showed significant
effects, up to 6 months after treatment, in its composite endpoint of death, mi or ischaemia. in the
prism study,  xxxd3385xxx  significantly reduced the
mortality rate after 30 days. however, some other
benefits and effects of  xxxd3385xxx  revealed in the restore study seemed to decrease during long-term
observation after treatment.
similarly, the clinical effects of  xxxd53xxx  have
been reported through large studies such as epic
(evaluation of  xxxd53xxx  fab in the prevention of ischemic
complications),[12] epilog (evaluation in ptca to
improve long-term outcome with  xxxd53xxx  gp
iib/iiia blockade),[13] capture ( xxxd53xxx  fab antiplatelet therapy in unstable refractory angina)[14]
and rapport (reopro and primary ptca organization and randomized trial). [1 5] the results of
these studies are summarised in table ii.  xxxd53xxx

also decreased mortality rate, mi and the necessity
for coronary intervention, and such effects of
 xxxd53xxx  seemed to persist longer than those of
 xxxd3385xxx .[16]
some papers have reviewed that the potency of
these two drugs cannot be simply compared through
the above clinical studies alone,[17-19] because of the
baseline differences of the enrolled patients or definitions of mi and ischemia. more recent data have
shown, however, that  xxxd53xxx  is more potent
than  xxxd3385xxx  with regard to patients undergoing
stenting, by direct comparison of these two
drugs.[20] this study presented some evidence that
 xxxd53xxx  is superior to  xxxd3385xxx  in clinical effect.
1.3 adverse effects

generally speaking, the most predictable adverse effect of gp iib/iiia antagonists is bleeding
caused by suppression of platelet function. however, in most of the clinical trials described in
section 1.3, significant increases in bleeding events
were not detected, and only the restore study
revealed any tendency for major bleeding.[9-11]
instead,  xxxd3385xxx  tended to cause thrombocytopenia,
defined as a decrease in platelet count <90 000
cells/mm3; in the prism study there was a significant association between  xxxd3385xxx  use and this
adverse effect.
in some patients with renal dysfunction,
bleeding time is prolonged by gp iib/iiia antagonists. in healthy volunteers or in patients with
moderate renal impairment, bleeding time corre-

lates with plasma concentrations of the gp iib/iiia
antagonist and the difference between the two
groups is not very apparent. [21] in patients with
severe renal impairment, however, prolongation of
bleeding time occurs with lower plasma concentrations of the inhibitor. this phenomenon is
explained by the altered response of platelets
from uraemic patients rather than by a pharmacokinetic mechanism. in such platelets, the granular contents of adp and serotonin, and thromboxane production, are reduced, and cytoplasmic
calcium and cyclic  xxxd81xxx 
are increased. binding sensitivity to gp iib/iiia
receptors may be altered by these changes.
as for  xxxd53xxx , the tendency to cause bleeding seems to be clearer than with  xxxd3385xxx . significant increases of major bleeding events were
reported in the epic study, and in the capture
study both major and minor bleeding events
were reported,[12,14] although the incidence of
bleeding seems to depend upon the concomitant
use of heparin.[22,23]
2. drug profiles
2.1 structure and pharmacological profile

 xxxd3385xxx , [l-tyrosine-n-(butylsulfonyl)-o-[4(4-piperidinebutyl)]], is an nonpeptide tyrosine derivative with a molecular weight of 495, much
smaller than that of  xxxd53xxx  which is approximately 50 000 (figure 1). such a small molecule
may fit into the rgd sequence binding pocket of

the iib/iiia receptor, while  xxxd53xxx  may just
cover the receptor.[24] the chemical structure of
 xxxd3385xxx  does not contain the rgd sequence itself,
but its discovery was based on a structural analysis
using nuclear magnetic resonance.
the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of  xxxd3385xxx  for inhibition of platelet aggregation is 0.011
mumol/l (5.45 mug/l). an approximately 10 000fold higher concentration is required to inhibit
binding of fibrinogen,  xxxg2422xxx  or fibronectin
to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, meaning a high selectivity of  xxxd3385xxx  against platelet
iib/iiia receptors.[8] another in vitro study revealed that  xxxd3385xxx  inhibited platelet aggregation
induced by various kinds of agonist including
adp, collagen,  xxxd208xxx , thromboxane analogues or thrombin, but not by ristocetin, which
triggers aggregation mediated by von willebrand
factor.[25] this study also reported that inhibition
of iib/iiia by  xxxd3385xxx  was competitive. when
administered intravenously to humans,  xxxd3385xxx 
inhibits platelet aggregation dose-dependently, but
seems to dissociate rapidly from platelets and its effect is reversed within 3 hours after the end of infusion.
the concentration-effect relationship in human
studies has also been reported.[26] inhibition of adpinduced platelet aggregation showed good correlation with plasma concentration of  xxxd3385xxx , and
this effect saturated within a narrow concentration

range from 10 to 50 mug/l. this concentration-effect
relationship in individual data fitted a sigmoid
maximum effect (emax) model. prolongation of
bleeding time also correlated with plasma concentration of  xxxd3385xxx , but was seen at higher concentration of  xxxd3385xxx  in comparison with that for inhibition of platelet aggregation.[25] this phenomenon
is explained by the number of residual iib/iiia receptors.
in contrast,  xxxd53xxx  binds irreversibly to the
iib/iiia receptor, resulting in a longer effect of 12
to 24 hours.[27,28] gp iib/iiia receptor blocking by
 xxxd53xxx  was rapidly saturated within 30 minutes
from the start of infusion, and maintained >80% of
receptors blocked during the infusion. at 12 hours
after the end of treatment, about a 20% reduction
in receptor blocking was observed. the plasma
concentration of  xxxd53xxx  was reported not to
correlate with inhibition of platelet aggregation,[29]
because of the fast clearance of  xxxd53xxx  from
plasma as described in section 2.2, but the degree
of iib/iiia receptor blocking did correlate with in-

hibition of aggregation.  xxxd53xxx  not only blocks
gp iib/iiia, but also reacts with alphavbeta3 integrin
( xxxg2422xxx  receptor), and simultaneous blocking
of this receptor may affect platelet aggregation or
thrombotic occlusion.[16,30,31]

between platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma labelling. whole blood/plasma ratios of  xxxd3385xxx 
ranged from 0.6 to 0.9, depending on the  xxxd3385xxx 
concentration (20 to 200 mug/l).
2.4 metabolism

2.2 pharmacokinetic parameters

since both  xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  have negligible oral bioavailability they have to be given parenterally.
three clinical studies of the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd3385xxx  are available.[26,32,33] in these studies,
plasma and urine concentrations of  xxxd3385xxx  were
determined using radioimmunoassay.[34] a concentration-time curve for a 1-hour continuous infusion
was reported by barrett et al.[26]mean plasma concentrations of  xxxd3385xxx  reached a peak within 1
hour, and the maximal concentrations were dose
proportional over the range from 0.05 to 0.4
mug/kg/min. similarly, dose proportionality was also
observed during 4 hours of infusion (range 0.1 to
0.2 mug/kg/min). the pharmacokinetic parameters determined in these studies are summarised in
table iii.
the plasma half-life of  xxxd3385xxx  seems to be between 1.0 and 1.5 hours. volume of distribution
ranges from 21 to 87l, and plasma clearance from
4.8 to 25.8 l/h (80 to 430 ml/min).[26,32,33] the disparity of the reported parameters between these
reports could be related to drug dosage or ethnic
(caucasian or asian population) differences.
 xxxd53xxx  is rapidly cleared from plasma, in
contrast to its long duration of platelet binding. its
distribution phase was calculated to be about 26
minutes after single bolus injection.[29] another report also evaluated the plasma half-life of  xxxd53xxx  as 15 to 30 minutes. [35]
2.3 distribution

according to an in vitro study,  xxxd3385xxx  is not
highly bound to plasma proteins; percentage bound
in human plasma was calculated to be 64%.[36] its
distribution in blood was assessed by comparison

biotransformation of  xxxd3385xxx  in human liver
seems to be negligible, as in dogs but unlike in
rats.[36] incubation with human liver microsomes
or liver slices did not lead to metabolism of  xxxd3385xxx ,
while in rat microsomes 30% metabolism was
reported. in contrast, the free circulating form
of  xxxd53xxx  is rapidly cleared from plasma by
proteolytic breakdown.[24,35,37]
2.5 excretion

the kidney is the major route for plasma clearance of  xxxd3385xxx . within 24 hours of a 4-hour infusion of 0.15 mug/kg/min, 38% of unchanged drug
was detected in urine.[26] on the other hand, a preclinical study revealed that biliary excretion can be
a major elimination route of  xxxd3385xxx  in rats or
dogs.[36] according to data from a study of humans,
about 65% of administered  xxxd3385xxx  is calculated
to be excreted in urine and 25% in faeces.[38]
2.6 factors affecting the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd3385xxx 

although there are no reports that directly
demonstrate the relationship between renal dysfunction and the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3385xxx ,
lehne et al.[21] reported a relationship between renal function and the effect of lamifiban, another gp
iib/iiia antagonist. this study demonstrated that
the decreased drug clearance caused by renal dysfunction resulted in an increased potency of the
iib/iiia antagonist. since lamifiban is also a nonpeptide iib/iiia antagonist and, like  xxxd3385xxx , is
mainly excreted into urine, renal dysfunction is
thought to delay  xxxd3385xxx  clearance and enhance
its potency.
similarly, renal dysfunction also affects bleeding time as an adverse effect of gp iib/iiia antagclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

onists.[21] the prolongation of bleeding time occurs, however, by a pharmacodynamic mechanism
rather than for pharmacokinetic reasons, as described in section 1.3.
concomitant diabetes mellitus may also affect
the action of gp iib/iiia antagonists, since increased glycation of iib/iiia receptors and modified platelet function may occur.[39] a retrospective
analysis of the prism-plus study revealed that
diabetic patients had more coronary artery disease,
hypertension and heart failure, but that these patients also received the same benefits of  xxxd3385xxx 
as in nondiabetic patients.[18] the effects of
 xxxd53xxx  are not affected by abnormalities in
platelets.[40]
3. drug interactions
in a clinical situation, gp iib/iiia antagonists
are usually used with other antithrombotic agents.
the effects of some representative drugs on the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3385xxx  are reviewed below.
3.1 aspirin

aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ) is an inhibitor that
blocks just one signal transduction pathway in
platelet aggregation, the thromboxane a2 pathway,
and it is widely used for the treatment of various
thrombotic diseases. the effect of aspirin pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3385xxx  has been
reported.[26] oral administration of 325mg of aspi© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

rin did not affect the plasma concentration of
 xxxd3385xxx  during 4 hours of infusion (0.15 mug/kg/min)
and over the following 6 hours. the pharmacokinetic
parameters of  xxxd3385xxx  in this study are summarised
in table iii. under such conditions, aspirin enhanced the extension of bleeding time caused by
 xxxd3385xxx  (2.3-fold extension by  xxxd3385xxx  alonevs
4.1-fold by coadministration with aspirin). however, the effect of aspirin coadministration seemed
additive and not synergistic.
clinical data demonstrating the effects of concurrent aspirin on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd53xxx  are not available. since almost all the patients in the large studies of  xxxd53xxx  were
already being treated with aspirin, and a cessation
of this drug could have led to a disadvantage for
the patient, a definite comparison was not possible.
however, some researchers suspect that suppression by  xxxd53xxx  may be more obvious in the setting of pronounced baseline aggregation without
aspirin treatment.[29]
3.2 ticlopidine

ticlopidine specifically blocks the platelet aggregation induced by adp. orally administered
ticlopidine 200mg once daily for 4 days significantly enhanced platelet aggregation without affecting the plasma concentration of  xxxd3385xxx  during about 6 hours of infusion (0.05 mug/kg/min,
following bolus injection of 5.0 mug/kg) and a furclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

 xxxd3385xxx 

ther 6 hours after the infusion [see table iii]. [32]
bleeding time was prolonged about 2-fold by
 xxxd3385xxx  and concomitant use of ticlopidine did
not affect the bleeding time. that dosage of
ticlopidine (200 mg/day), the same as used clinically for japanese patients, did not itself prolong
bleeding time.
further, this study has another limitation. it was
not investigated whether a combination of high-dose
 xxxd3385xxx  and ticlopidine might affect bleeding tendency. in patients receiving ticlopidine, it is not
known (as far as we are aware) if high-dose  xxxd3385xxx 
can prolong bleeding time.
similarly, ticlopidine seems not to affect the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd53xxx . steinhubl et al.[40]
reported that concomitant ticlopidine therapy (250
or 500 mg/day) did not influence inhibition of
platelet aggregation by  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 hours), although the pharmacokinetic parameters were not
presented.

3.3 heparin

as well as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulatory
agents are also frequently used for the treatment of
thrombotic diseases. the prism-plus study examined combination therapy with  xxxd3385xxx  and
heparin.[10] however, pharmacokinetic conclusions
are not available from this study. coadministration of
heparin did not enhance but rather decreased the negative outcomes during  xxxd3385xxx  therapy. thus, it can
be inferred that heparin seems not to compete with
the effects of  xxxd3385xxx , nor does it promote its elimination.
for  xxxd53xxx , the epilog study observed the
effects of heparin coadministration.[13] here too,
pharmacokinetic parameters were not presented.
standard doses of heparin tended to increase the
bleeding events in comparison with low-dose heparin
under  xxxd53xxx  treatment, and a significant increase
in minor bleeding was detected. such enhancement
seemed additive, not synergistic.

3.4 low-molecular-weight
heparin (enoxaparin)

although not many pharmacokinetic parameters are available for coadministration of  xxxd1997xxx , one report discussed the
effect of enoxaparin, in comparison with coadministration of unfractionated heparin, on
 xxxd3385xxx  pharmacokinetics.[33] enoxaparin did not
affect the steady-state plasma concentration or
plasma clearance of  xxxd3385xxx  (table iii).
3.5 other drugs

some patients enrolled in the prism study used
beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, cardiac glycosides, diuretics or vasodilators in addition to
 xxxd3385xxx . further analysis of these patients did not
show any influence on the plasma clearance of
 xxxd3385xxx , and there are no reports indicating interaction of these drugs with  xxxd3385xxx .[41]
considering the elimination route of  xxxd3385xxx ,
drugs that are excreted into urine are possible candidates for interaction, for example angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, cardiac glycosides
or diuretics. however, the above analysis[41] suggests that such interactions, if they exist, have no
detectable clinical consequences.
4. conclusion
 xxxd3385xxx  seems to be a more selective iib/iiia receptor antagonist than  xxxd53xxx , which also blocks
 xxxg2422xxx  receptors and may have an effect on
thrombin generation. faster dissociation from gp
iib/iiia receptors also affects the pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic features of  xxxd3385xxx . its clinical
effect does not seem to persist as long as that of
 xxxd53xxx , but its shorter recovery time could be
an advantage from a safety viewpoint.
combination therapy with  xxxd3385xxx  and ticlopidine effectively suppressed adp-induced aggregation. although the suppression enhancement by
ticlopidine was not due to pharmacokinetic reaclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

kondo & umemura

sons, such an effect without bleeding prolongation
was not observed with  xxxd53xxx .
orally available gp iib/iiia antagonists are desirable for the optimal management of acute coronary syndromes. several compounds are now under development, although favourable results are
yet to be reported. although it is not clear whether
long duration of platelet suppression is indispensible or not, a comparative study has indicated that
 xxxd53xxx  was more potent with regard to protection from major ischaemic events.
