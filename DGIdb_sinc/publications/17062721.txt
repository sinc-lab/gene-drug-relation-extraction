treatment-related osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer
matthew r. smith

abstract

the intended therapeutic effect of  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonists is
hypogonadism, a major cause of acquired osteoporosis in men. consistent with this observation,
gnrh agonists increase bone turnover and decrease bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture
risk. large claims-based analyses and other retrospective studies provide compelling evidence
that gnrh agonists increase risk of clinical fractures. estrogens play a central role in homeostasis
of the normal male skeleton, and estrogen deficiency rather than testosterone deficiency seems
to be primarily responsible for the adverse skeletal effects of gnrh agonists. in randomized
controlled trials, bisphosphonates ( xxxd2837xxx  and  xxxd3561xxx ) and selective estrogen
receptor modulators (raloxifene and  xxxd3402xxx ) increased bone mineral density in gnrh
agonist ^ treated men. two ongoing large randomized placebo-controlled studies will prospectively define fracture outcomes in men with prostate cancer and assess the efficacy of novel
pharmacologic interventions (amg162,  xxxd3402xxx ) during gnrh agonist treatment.

osteoporosis in men
osteoporosis is common in both men and women. in the
united states, for example, osteoporosis is prevalent in f2
million men and another 12 million men are at risk (1). men
experience one third of all hip fractures. mortality after hip
fracture is greater in men than in women (2).
alcohol abuse, long-term glucocorticoid therapy, and hypogonadism account for approximately half of all cases of
osteoporosis in men (3). smoking, low dietary calcium intake,
vitamin d deficiency, and sedentary lifestyle contribute to risk
of osteoporosis (4).
hormone therapy for prostate cancer is a major cause of
male hypogonadism.  xxxg930xxx 
(gnrh) agonists are the mainstay of treatment for metastatic
prostate cancer and a routine part of management for many
men with locally advanced or recurrent nonmetastatic prostate
cancer (5). approximately 650,000 men are treated with a
gnrh agonist annually in the united states.

mechanisms of hypogonadal bone loss
gnrh agonists increase bone turnover in men with prostate
cancer (6, 7). biochemical markers of osteoclast and osteoblast
activity increase progressively after treatment with a gnrh
agonist and seem to reach a plateau after f6 months (7). in

prostate cancer, gnrh agonists increase parathyroid hormonemediated osteoclast activation (8), suggesting that changes in
skeletal sensitivity to  xxxg1885xxx  play an important
role in the pathogenesis of hypogonadal bone loss.
estrogens play an important role in skeletal homeostasis in
healthy men. osteoblasts and osteoclasts express estrogen
receptors (9 – 11). estrogens contribute to the regulation of
both osteoclast and osteoblast activity in men (12, 13). serum
estradiol levels are positively associated with spinal bone
mineral density and negatively associated with vertebral
fracture risk in healthy older men (14 – 16). additionally,
medical castration with estrogens does not decrease bone
mineral density (17) or increase bone turnover (18) in men
with prostate cancer.

bone loss during gnrh agonist therapy
gnrh agonists significantly decrease bone mineral density
in men with prostate cancer (table 1; refs. 6, 7, 19 – 22). most
studies have reported a 2% to 3% decrease per year in bone
mineral density of the hip and spine during initial therapy.
notably, significant bone loss has been observed despite
concurrent administration of supplemental calcium and
vitamin d and careful exclusion of secondary causes of
osteoporosis (7, 22). bone mineral density seems to decline
steadily during long-term treatment (23, 24).

three large claims-based studies provide compelling evidence that gnrh agonists increase the risk of clinical fractures.
in a study of medical claims from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program and medicare database, 19.4%
of men with prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy (bilateral orchiectomies or gnrh agonist) had a
fracture compared with 12.6% of those not receiving androgen
deprivation therapy (p <.001; ref. 25). treatment duration
independently predicted fracture risk. in men who received

nine or more doses of a gnrh agonist, for example, the relative risk of any fracture was 1.45 [95% confidence interval
(95% ci), 1.36-1.56]. androgen deprivation therapy independently predicted fracture risk after controlling for other
covariates.
in a study of medical claims data from a 5% national
random sample of medicare beneficiaries, men receiving gnrh
agonist treatment for prostate cancer were more likely to
develop fractures than a control group of men with prostate
cancer who had not received a gnrh agonist (relative risk,
1.21; 95% ci, 1.14-1.29; p <.001). rates of vertebral fractures
(relative risk, 1.45; 95% ci, 1.14-1.69; p = 0.002) and hipfemur fractures (relative risk, 1.30; 95% ci, 1.10-1.53;
p = 0.002) were also significantly greater in men who received
a gnrh agonist. after controlling for age, race, geographic
location, and comorbidity, gnrh agonist treatment independently predicted fracture risk.
increased fracture risk was also observed in a study that used
a database of medical and pharmacy claims from 16 large
companies in the united states (26). rates of any fracture were
7.91 per 100 person-years at risk for men who received a gnrh
agonist compared with 6.55 per 100 person-years at risk for
men who did not receive a gnrh agonist (relative risk, 1.21;
95% ci, 1.09-1.34). after controlling for other factors, gnrh
agonist treatment was independently associated with fracture
risk. age and comorbidity were also independent risk factors
for fractures.
other retrospective studies have consistently reported high
rates of clinical fracture in gnrh agonist – treated men with
prostate cancer (27 – 30). bilateral orchiectomies are also
associated with increased fracture risk in men with prostate
cancer (31, 32).
several factors may account for the increased rates of clinical
fractures in men receiving androgen deprivation, including
increased fall risk due to metastatic disease, increased fall risk
due to treatment-related frailty, and decreased bone mineral
density, a surrogate for fracture risk. the relative contributions
of each of these factors have not been adequately characterized,
but treatment-related changes in bone mineral density seem to
be sufficient to explain most of the increase in fracture risk in
men with prostate cancer.

prevention and treatment
calcium and vitamin d. high dietary calcium intake
(>2,000 mg/d) is associated with increased risk of prostate
cancer (33, 34). this association has been attributed to low

clin cancer res 2006;12(20 suppl) october 15, 2006

concentrations of active  xxxd408xxx  due to
decreased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin d to 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d (35). the link between dietary calcium
and prostate cancer risk has led to concern about the
potential effect of supplemental calcium on disease progression in men with prostate cancer. there is no evidence,
however, that dietary calcium intake is causally related to
prostate cancer risk or that the recommended dietary calcium
intake of 1,200 to 1,500 mg/d influences prostate cancer
progression. moreover, treatment with the combination of
supplemental calcium and vitamin d during gnrh agonist
therapy increases serum levels of both 25-hydroxyvitamin d
and  xxxd408xxx  (7).
the food and nutrition board of the nih recommends
supplemental vitamin d (400 iu/d) and supplemental calcium
to maintain a total dietary calcium intake between 1,200 and
1,500 mg/d (3). in older men and women, dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin d moderately reduces
bone loss in the hip and spine and decreases fracture incidence
(36). calcium and vitamin d are recommended to help
prevent bone loss during gnrh agonist therapy. consistent
with recent data in postmenopausal women, however, supplemental calcium and vitamin d are not sufficient to prevent
bone loss in most men receiving androgen deprivation therapy
for prostate cancer.
bisphosphonates. intermittent administration of either i.v.
 xxxd2837xxx  or  xxxd3561xxx  prevents treatment-related
bone loss in men with prostate cancer (refs. 7, 22, 37;
table 2). we evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2837xxx  during
androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate
cancer (7). forty-seven men with prostate cancer were
randomly assigned to receive leuprolide alone or leuprolide
and  xxxd2837xxx  (aredia, novartis oncology; 60 mg i.v. every
12 weeks). all subjects were treated with supplemental calcium
and vitamin d. study participants had locally advanced, lymph
node – positive, or recurrent prostate cancer and no bone
metastases by bone scan. the primary outcome measure was
the percentage change in bone mineral density of the lumbar
spine after 1 year. mean changes in bone mineral density at
1 year differed significantly between groups in posterioranterior lumbar spine (p <.001), trochanter (p = 0.003), and
total hip (p = 0.005). in men treated with leuprolide alone,
mean bone mineral density decreased by 3.3% in posterioranterior lumbar spine and 1.8% in total hip (p < 0.001 for each
comparison with baseline). in contrast, mean bone mineral
density did not change significantly at any skeletal site in men
treated with both leuprolide and  xxxd2837xxx .

in another prospective study, 21 men with prostate cancer
and bone metastases were randomly assigned to treatment with
 xxxd2837xxx  (90 mg) or placebo at study entry (37). subjects
were crossed over to the other treatment at 6 months. the
study included only men who had received androgen
deprivation therapy for at least 6 months before study entry.
primary study end points were bone mineral density by dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed
tomography. subject data for the two placebo treatment
periods (first 6 months and the 6 months after crossover)
were pooled and compared with the pooled data for subjects
during the  xxxd2837xxx  treatment periods. among 18 evaluable men,  xxxd2837xxx  significantly increased bone mineral
density of the hip and spine.
a third study evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd3561xxx . in a
multicenter prospective study, 106 men with locally advanced
or recurrent prostate cancer and no bone metastases were
randomly assigned to receive androgen deprivation therapy
plus  xxxd3561xxx  (zometa; novartis oncology; 4 mg i.v.
every 12 weeks) or androgen deprivation therapy plus placebo
(22). men with other conditions associated with osteoporosis
were excluded. bone mineral densities of posterior-anterior
lumbar spine and proximal femur were measured by dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry. changes in bone mineral density
differed significantly between the groups at all skeletal sites. in
men receiving  xxxd3561xxx , mean bone mineral density
increased from baseline by 5.3% in the lumbar spine and 1.1%
in the total hip. in the placebo group, mean bone mineral
density decreased by 2.0% in the lumbar spine and 2.8% in the
total hip. these results indicate that  xxxd3561xxx  (4 mg i.v.
every 3 months) not only prevents bone loss but also increases
bone mineral density during androgen deprivation therapy for
prostate cancer.
receptor activator of nuclear factor kb ligand inhibition. the
receptor activator of nuclear factor nb (rank) signaling
pathway regulates the activation, differentiation, proliferation,
and apoptosis of osteoclasts (38). the pathway consists of
rank ligand, its receptor rank, and its decoy receptor

 xxxg2299xxx . rank ligand binds and activates rank, a
 xxxg1608xxx  expressed on hematopoietic stem
cells, monocytes, and osteoclasts. rank expression on stem
cells is required for osteoclast differentiation and activation.
hormones and other factors that stimulate bone resorption
induce the expression of rank ligand by bone stromal cells
and osteoblasts.
amg162 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds and
neutralizes human rank ligand. in postmenopausal women, a
single administration of amg162 resulted in marked (>80%)
and sustained (6 month) suppression of osteoclast activity
(39). amg162 is under development for the treatment and
prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment-related
osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer and in women with
breast cancer, and bone metastases. in an ongoing phase 3
study, termed hormone ablation bone loss trial in prostate
cancer, f1,400 men receiving a gnrh agonist for prostate
cancer were randomly assigned to either amg162 s.c. every 6
months or placebo (table 3). study outcomes include incident
vertebral body fractures and bone mineral density.
estrogens. in contrast to bilateral orchiectomies or treatment with a gnrh agonist, medical castration with estrogens is
not associated with treatment-related osteoporosis. in a small
nonrandomized study of men with prostate cancer, for
example, changes in bone mineral density were compared
between men who underwent castration by either bilateral
orchiectomies or treatment with estrogen (17). hip bone
mineral density decreased by 10% after 1 year in men who
underwent bilateral orchiectomies compared with only 1% in
men treated with estrogen.
estrogen replacement therapy may prevent osteoporosis in
gnrh agonist – treated men, although information about the
efficacy and safety of estrogens in castrated men with prostate
cancer is limited. in a randomized controlled trial of 25
castrated men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, estradiol
(1 mg/d) significantly decreased biochemical markers of osteoclast activity after 9 weeks (40). a small cross-sectional study
reached similar conclusions (18).

to date, no controlled trial has assessed the effects of
medical castration with estrogen on bone mineral density or
fracture risk in men with prostate cancer. similarly, no
controlled trials have assessed estrogen replacement therapy
on clinical outcomes in castrated men with prostate
cancer.
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators. raloxifene is a
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator approved to prevent
and treat osteoporosis in women. raloxifene mimics the
beneficial effects of estrogens in bone without stimulatory
effects in most other tissues (41). raloxifene prevents early
postmenopausal bone loss in women and reduces the rate of
vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (42, 43). in a 12-month open-label study, men with
nonmetastatic prostate cancer (n = 48) who were receiving
a gnrh agonist were assigned randomly to raloxifene
(60 mg/d) or no raloxifene. bone mineral density of the
posteroanterior lumbar spine and proximal femur was
measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. raloxifene
significantly increased bone mineral density of the hip and
tended to increase bone mineral density of the spine.
raloxifene also decreased biochemical markers of bone
turnover, suggesting that raloxifene increases bone mineral
density by similar mechanism(s) in postmenopausal women
and hypogonadal men.
 xxxd3402xxx  is a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
 xxxd3402xxx  is also being developed for treatment of
osteoporosis and other complications associated with hormone therapy for prostate cancer. in a 6-month placebocontrolled study, 46 men with prostate cancer who were
receiving a gnrh agonist were assigned randomly to either
 xxxd3402xxx  or placebo (44).  xxxd3402xxx  (60 mg/d) significantly increased bone mineral density and reduced hot
flashes. in an ongoing phase 3 study, >1,200 men who are
receiving a gnrh agonist for prostate cancer have been
randomly assigned to either  xxxd3402xxx  or placebo (table 3).
study outcomes include fractures, bone mineral density, and
hot flashes.
antiandrogen monotherapy.  xxxd334xxx  is a peripherally
selective, nonsteroidal antiandrogen that competitively inhibits
the action of androgens by binding to androgen receptors in
the target tissue.  xxxd334xxx  (50 mg/d by mouth) is indicated
for use in combination with a gnrh agonist to treat metastatic
prostate cancer. monotherapy with  xxxd334xxx  at higher
doses (150 mg/d by mouth) has been evaluated as adjuvant
therapy for early-stage prostate cancer and as alternative to
medical or surgical castration in men with nonmetastatic
prostate cancer.  xxxd334xxx , 150 mg monotherapy, is
approved to treat locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate
cancer in more than 50 countries but not in the united states.
 xxxd334xxx  does not have an established role in early-stage disease.
 xxxd334xxx  monotherapy increases serum concentrations
of estradiol (45). consistent with the important role of
estrogen in male skeletal homeostasis,  xxxd334xxx  monotherapy has beneficial effects on bone. in two prospective
randomized controlled trials of men with nonmetastatic
prostate cancer,  xxxd334xxx  monotherapy significantly
decreased markers of bone turnover and increased bone
mineral density compared with treatment with a gnrh
agonist (46, 47).

clin cancer res 2006;12(20 suppl) october 15, 2006

conclusions
gnrh agonists increase bone turnover, decrease bone
mineral density, and increase fracture risk in men with prostate
cancer. estrogens play a central role in homeostasis of the
normal male skeleton, and estrogen deficiency rather than
testosterone deficiency seems to be primarily responsible for the
adverse skeletal effects of gnrh agonists. in small randomized
controlled trials, bisphosphonates ( xxxd2837xxx  and  xxxd3561xxx ) and selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators
(raloxifene and  xxxd3402xxx ) increased bone mineral density in
gnrh agonist – treated men. at present, no consensus guidelines exist for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of
osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer. in recent reviews,
most authors recommend screening for osteoporosis with dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, weight-bearing exercise,
supplemental calcium and vitamin d, and selective treatment
with bisphosphonates for men at the greatest risk of fracture
(48, 49). at least two large randomized placebo-controlled
fracture studies in gnrh agonist – treated men are ongoing.
these studies prospectively define fracture outcomes in men
with prostate cancer and assess the efficacy of novel pharmacologic interventions (amg162,  xxxd3402xxx ) in this setting.

open discussion
dr. bruland: one aspect in these men with androgen
deprivation is obviously the direct endocrine effect on the
skeleton. furthermore, many of our patients have cognitive
dysfunction and are in a state of low physical activity. do you
think physical exercise can do some good?
dr. smith: absolutely. these are older men, and fracture
risk is one issue they face while receiving hormone therapy.
changes in bone mineral density are sufficient to explain the
increase in fracture risk, but there are certainly other issues,
including muscle loss. i recommend diet and exercise to all of
my patients whether or not they are receiving hormone therapy.
dr. pearse: what is the anticipated rate of bone metastases?
how many patients are you going to have to look at before you
know whether administration of a bisphosphonate will have
an impact?
dr. smith: nearly all of the 30,000 to 40,000 men per year
who die in the united states have bone metastases. many men
with fatal prostate cancer develop metastases early. a lot of the
patients receiving long-term treatment, even when hormone
therapy fails, were previously thought to be at extraordinarily
high risk of developing bone metastases. we now have other
ways to identify a higher risk.
dr. coleman: i was amazed when i saw in the new england
journal of medicine that the risk of fracture  xxxd1891xxx  years is 50%.
do you think there is any reason now not to give some kind of
bone protection?
dr. smith: fracture-free survival was about 50%. about
20% of men receiving hormone therapy had any at 3 years
compared with 12% for men not receiving hormone therapy.
however, it is high and that becomes one of the challenges. in
breast cancer and prostate cancer, we have fairly convincing
data that we increase fracture risk with our treatments. then
the question becomes, ‘‘do we know enough to intervene in
all or most patients or do we need to do fracture prevention
studies?’’

osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer

dr. suva: wouldn’t a certain proportion of men already be
eligible for bisphosphonate therapy independent of their
prostate cancer?
dr. smith: that’s how i treat a lot of the patients on
trials, but those who aren’t on trials i manage in the same
way. if they are going to receive long-term treatment to
salvage therapy, we perform a baseline dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry scan. if they have osteoporosis they get

treated, and if they don’t i typically give them calcium and
multivitamins.
dr. weilbaecher: are there data that raloxifene kills cancer?
dr. smith: in prostate cancer there are no good human data,
but there are some preclinical data that would suggest that may
be the case. we’ve studied a number of approaches and it turns
out estrogen works in androgen-independent prostate cancer, at
least with  xxxg1281xxx  responses.
