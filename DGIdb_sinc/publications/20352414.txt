abstract
background initial hypotheses regarding the role of the kappa
opioid system in drug addiction suggested that  xxxg1633xxx 
stimulation had anti-addictive effects. however, recent
research suggests that  xxxg1633xxx  antagonists may reverse
motivational aspects of dependence. in the present review,
we revisit the studies that measured the effects of  xxxg1633xxx 
ligands on the reinforcing and rewarding effects of drugs
and postulate underlying neurobiological mechanisms for
these effects to elaborate a more complex view of the role
of  xxxg1633xxx  ligands in drug addiction.
results the review of studies indicates that  xxxg1633xxx 
stimulation generally antagonizes the acute reinforcing/
rewarding effects of drugs whereas  xxxg1633xxx  blockade has
no consistent effect. however, in a drug dependent-like
state,  xxxg1633xxx  blockade was effective in reducing
increased drug intake. in animal models of reinstatement,
 xxxg1633xxx  stimulation can induce reinstatement via a stresslike mechanism. results in conditioned place preference/
aversion and intracranial self-stimulation indicate that kappa
receptor agonists produce, respectively, aversive-like and
dysphoric-like effects. additionally, preclinical and postmortem studies show that administration or selfadministration of cocaine, ethanol, and heroin activate the
kappa opioid system.
conclusion  xxxg1633xxx  agonists antagonize the reinforcing/
rewarding effects of drugs possibly through punishing/

activate the kappa opioid system, which may play a key role in

over two decades, research on the relationship between the
dynorphin/kappa opioid system and drug addiction has increased, and extensive reviews on this issue have been
made. in the present review, we focus on the effects of the kappa
opioid system on the reinforcing/rewarding effects of drugs
of abuse and postulate underlying neurobiological mechanisms for these effects. we also briefly discuss neuroadaptations in the dynorphin/kappa opioid system during
chronic exposure to drugs of abuse.

physiological function of the dynorphin/kappa opioid system
dynorphins are opioid peptides derived from the  xxxg1722xxx  precursor, along with the enkephalins and the
endorphins, and contain the leucine (leu)-enkephalin
sequence at the n-terminal portion of the molecule (rossier
1982; rossier and chapouthier 1982; schwarzer 2009).
except dynorphin a(2–13), an inactive metabolite of
dynorphin a(1–17), dynorphins bind to all three opioid
receptors (schwarzer 2009). however, dynorphins, especially dynorphin a, are considered to show a preference for
kappa receptors (chavkin et al. 1982). dynorphins have
widespread distribution in the central nervous system
(watson et al. 1982) and play a role in a wide variety of
physiological systems, including neuroendocrine regulation, pain regulation, motor activity, cardiovascular function, respiration, temperature regulation, feeding behavior,
and stress responsivity (fallon and leslie 1986). activation
of the dynorphin/ xxxg1633xxx  system produces actions that
are similar to other opioids but also actions that are
opposite to those of mu receptors (table 1). for example,
both the  xxxg1635xxx  agonist morphine and  xxxg1633xxx  agonist
ketocyclazocine exert antinociceptive effects in rats, but
these drugs increase and decrease, respectively, locomotor
activity in rats (iwamoto 1981). ketocyclazocine is a kappa

receptor agonist with a weak affinity for µ receptors (i.e., ki
value, 909 µg/kg compared with 7.1 µg/kg of naloxone or
26 µg/kg of buprenorphine) (rosenbaum et al. 1985).
based on the data in a three-choice drug discrimination
paradigm (white and holtzman 1983) and the receptorbinding comparison with that of [3h]-u69593 (nock et al.
1988), ketocyclazocine appears to mainly act at kappa
receptors (leander 1983; locke et al. 1982), although
we cannot completely exclude µ receptor-mediated action
of the drug (ko et al. 1998; picker 1994). similarly, mu
agonists decrease milk or water drinking behavior in
rodents, whereas kappa agonists increase these behaviors
(hartig and opitz 1983; locke et al. 1982). because of
diuretic actions of kappa agonists, the effect of kappa agonists on
water intake is less clear than that on feeding. it appears
that kappa agonists initially suppress drinking with increased
latency to drinking, whereas morphine decreases drinking
without behavioral disturbance. however, after the initial
suppression, kappa agonists enhance drinking. for example,
u50488, a kappa agonist, dose-dependently suppressed water
drinking (adipsia) during the first hour of treatment,
followed by a period of polydipsia likely caused by
diuresis in normally hydrated rats (badiani and stewart
1992). similarly, a study by lee and clifton (1992) also
showed the initial suppression of water drinking by
pd117302 and u50488h, which was followed by sustained increase of drinking. in the motivational domain, mu
agonists produce rewarding effects, whereas kappa agonists
produce aversive effects in animals and humans
(mclaughlin et al. 2003; shippenberg et al. 2007; zimmer
et al. 2001). neurochemically,  xxxg1633xxx  stimulation
decreases dopamine release in the brain, whereas activation of mu receptors increases it (di chiara and imperato
1988). therefore, to a large extent, kappa receptors may be
hypothesized to act in opposition to activation of mu
receptors (fig. 1).

fig. 1 neurocircuitry associated with the positive reinforcement of
drugs of abuse and the negative reinforcement of dependence and how
it changes in the transition from nondependent drug taking to
dependent drug taking (modified with permission from koob and
le moal 2008). key elements of the reward circuit are dopamine (da)
and opioid peptides at both the ventral tegmental area (vta) and
nucleus accumbens, which are activated during initial use and the
early binge/intoxication stage of the addiction cycle. key elements of
the stress circuit are  xxxg517xxx  (crf) and
norepinephrine (ne) neurons that converge on  xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) interneurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, which are
activated during the development of dependence. the hypothesis
elaborated here is that in nondependent animals, opioid peptides that
preferentially activate µ opioid receptors have a facilitatory effect on
the positive reinforcing actions of drugs of abuse but that opioid
peptides that preferentially activate kappa opioid receptors have an
inhibitory effect on the positive reinforcing actions of drugs of abuse.
in contrast, in dependent animals, the mu opioid system is compromised
via tolerance-like neuroadaptations, and the kappa opioid system becomes
either activated or sensitized indirectly by drugs of abuse via the
dopaminergic–creb system and via an interaction with the stress
system, manifesting its influence on compulsive drug seeking. mu and
kappa receptors are distributed across all of these brain regions and the
spinal cord. for example, “a high correlation between  xxxg1635xxx 
mrna expression and binding is observed in the striatal clusters and

patches of the nucleus accumbens and caudate–putamen, diagonal
band of broca, globus pallidus and ventral pallidum, bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis, most thalamic nuclei, medial and cortical
amygdala, mammillary nuclei, presubiculum, interpeduncular nucleus,
median raphe, raphe magnus, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus,
nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. differences in mu
receptor mrna and binding distributions are observed in regions such
as the neocortex, olfactory bulb, superior colliculus, spinal trigeminal
nucleus, and spinal cord, which might be a consequence of receptor
transport to presynaptic terminals.” with respect to  xxxg1633xxx 
distribution, “a high degree of correlation between kappa1 receptor mrna
expression and binding is observed in regions such as the nucleus
accumbens, caudate–putamen, olfactory tubercle, bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, dorsomedial, and ventromedial hypothalamus, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei,
parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and
the nucleus of the solitary tract. differences in kappa1 receptor binding and
mrna distribution in the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral
tegmental area, and neural lobe of the pituitary might be due to
receptor transport” [koob and le moal (2006), opioids. in neurobiology of addiction pp. 152–153. academic press, london]. the
arrows indicate the increase of activities in the positive and negative
reinforcement circuits, and the relative differences in the size of the
arrows represent the relative differences in the activities

the kappa opioid system also appears to play a role in stress
responses. stress increases dynorphin in brain regions
related to stress responses (chartoff et al. 2009; shirayama
et al. 2004). anatomically, one third of  xxxg1722xxx 
neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala co-express
crf, implying a close interaction between the kappa opioid and
crf systems (marchant et al. 2007). additionally, dynorphin neuron project and make direct synaptic contacts with
noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brain region
related to arousal, attention, and stress responses (reyes et
al. 2007). endocrinologically, kappa agonists can stimulate the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis (calogero et al.
1996; nikolarakis et al. 1987). behaviorally, the kappa opioid

system participates in stress-induced analgesia. forced
swim stress-induced increases in the latency to withdraw
the tail from hot water in mice was blocked by norbinaltorphimine (nor-bni), a kappa antagonist, or by disruption
of the  xxxg1722xxx  gene in mice (mclaughlin et al.
2006b; mclaughlin et al. 2003). similarly, inhibition of the
dynorphin system, but not the enkephalin and  xxxg1801xxx 
systems, was effective in antagonizing restraint-induced
increases in antinociception measured in the tail-flick and
tail-pinch methods in mice (suh et al. 2000; takahashi et al.
1990), although all three opioid systems have also been
suggested in stress-induced analgesia (yamada and
nabeshima 1995). additionally, nor-bni and  xxxg1722xxx 

124

deletion inhibited forced swim-induced and crf-induced
place aversion in mice (land et al. 2008). it is suggested
that disruption of the  xxxg1722xxx  gene produces compensations in the µ opioid system (clarke et al. 2003).
however, the evidence that both  xxxg1722xxx  gene
disruption and nor-bni blocked forced swim-induced
and crf-induced place aversions (land et al. 2008) and
forced swim stress-induced analgesia (mclaughlin et al.
2003) supports the role of kappa receptors in stress responses.
the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptors are also suggested to
mediate stress-induced deficits in learning and memory
(carey et al. 2009).
dynorphin activation is also hypothesized to contribute
to negative emotional states. for example, kappa agonists
produce place aversions in rats and mice (mucha and
herz 1985; shippenberg and herz 1986; zhang et al.
2005) and aversive effects in humans, such as confusion,
dizziness, sweating, and dysphoria, (pfeiffer et al. 1986;
walsh et al. 2001). moreover, kappa agonists produce
depression-like behaviors when measured in forced swim
and brain reward stimulation tests in rodents (carlezon et
al. 2006; dinieri et al. 2009; mague et al. 2003;
todtenkopf et al. 2004; tomasiewicz et al. 2008), whereas
kappa antagonists have antidepressant effects (carr et al. 2009;
mague et al. 2003; newton et al. 2002; pliakas et al. 2001;
shirayama et al. 2004). kappa antagonists also exert
anxiolytic effects in rats (knoll et al. 2007). similarly,
dynorphin depletion or kappa antagonists decrease anxiety-like
behavior in mice, which is reversed by treatment with
u-50488h, a kappa agonist (wittmann et al. 2009). consistent
with these results, dynorphin gene deletion abolished the
stress effect on the enhancement of immobility in a tail
suspension test and stress-induced hyperthemia, suggesting a clear role of dynorphin in the stress effect. however,
wittmann et al. (2009) also found that dynorphin deletion
produced an increase of immobility in a tail suspension
test, although the gene deletion produced only a minor
difference in immobility at the third trial out of five trials
in a forced swim test. the ventral tegmental area and its
projection terminals were identified as neuroanatomical
sites for the place aversion effects of kappa agonists
(bals-kubik et al. 1993).

effect of the kappa opioid system on the reinforcing/
rewarding effects of drugs
numerous studies have been performed on the effects of kappa
agonists and antagonists on various actions of drugs of
abuse, especially cocaine. these studies have led to the
hypothesis that  xxxg1633xxx  stimulation may have antiaddictive effects (prisinzano et al. 2005; shippenberg et
al. 2001, 2007). however, the potential of kappa antagonists in

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:121–135

drug addiction treatment has also been recently proposed
(bruchas et al. 2009; shippenberg 2009). in the section
below, we revisit the studies that measured the effects of kappa
receptor ligands on the reinforcing actions of abused drugs.
opioids
unlike mu agonists, kappa agonists do not produce reinforcing
effects. u50488h, a kappa agonist, failed to substitute for
heroin self-administration in rats (koob et al. 1986; xi et al.
1998). rather, kappa agonists dose-dependently decreased
morphine self-administration in rats and mice (glick et al.
1995; kuzmin et al. 1997), whereas nor-bni, a kappa
antagonist, had no effect on morphine and heroin selfadministration in rats and monkeys (glick et al. 1995;
negus et al. 1993; xi et al. 1998). very low doses of
u50488h [0.1, 0.5 mg/kg compared with 2.5–10 mg/kg in
glick et al. (1995) and kuzmin et al. (1997)] increased
(0.1 mg/kg) and then decreased (0.5 mg/kg) heroin selfadministration in mice (xi et al. 1998). the very low dose
effect of u50488h is similar to those of dopamine receptor
antagonists on psychostimulant self-administration. increased psychostimulant self-administration by dopamine
receptor antagonists is viewed as initial compensatory
increase of drug intake by animals to the antagonizing
effect of the treatment. thus, the data may suggest an
antagonistic effect of u50488h at a very low dose on
heroin self-administration reflected as a possible shift to the
right of the dose–response function. regarding the effect of
kappa agonists on µ agonist-induced conditioned place preference (cpp), it is well established that kappa agonists themselves
produces conditioned place aversion. therefore, the decreased morphine-associated cpp by kappa agonists (tsuji et al.
2001) is likely to result from the addition of the aversive
effects of kappa agonists to the rewarding effect of µ agonists
via a separate circuit, rather than the direct involvement of
the kappa agonists in mediating the reward activity of µ
agonists. additionally, co-administration of u69593, a kappa
agonist, failed to alter morphine pretreatment-induced
potentiation of morphine-induced cpp in rats (shippenberg
et al. 1998). thus, although the stimulation of kappa receptors
can decrease the self-administration and cpp of mu agonists,
 xxxg1633xxx  activation may have more of a punishment action
than a key role in the acute reinforcing/rewarding mechanism of mu agonists.
early studies showed that rats physically dependent on
morphine self-administered dynorphins in a stable manner
under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement and showed
no morphine-like withdrawal signs during selfadministration (khazan et al. 1983). similarly, rats dependent on morphine also self-administered ketocyclazocine
and ethylketocyclazocine, kappa agonists, for 15 days without
morphine-like withdrawal signs (young and khazan 1983).

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:121–135

blockade of kappa receptors by nor-bni potentiated naloxoneprecipitated morphine withdrawal symptoms in rats
(spanagel et al. 1994). however, gene disruption of kappa
receptors reduced naltrexone-precipitated morphine
withdrawal in mice (simonin et al. 1998), and 5′guanidinonaltrindole, a kappa antagonist, had no effect on the
withdrawal-induced increase in heroin choice over food in
a choice self-administration paradigm in rhesus monkeys
(negus and rice 2009). in humans,  xxxg1722xxx  and kappa
receptor polymorphisms were reported to be associated
with opioid dependence (clarke et al. 2009; gerra et al.
2007). collectively, the data suggest that the kappa opioid
system may modulate morphine dependence, but unclear
is how the kappa opioid system interacts with motivational
aspects of opioid dependence.
alcohol
kappa agonists decreased free-access ethanol drinking in
rats when injected once per day for 4 or 5 days (lindholm
et al. 2001; nestby et al. 1999). in mice, the acute
stimulation of brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  receptor,
which increased  xxxg1722xxx , also decreased free ethanol
drinking, an effect that was attenuated by nor-bni, a
selective kappa antagonist (logrip et al. 2008). similarly, acute
injections of enadolin (ci-977, a  xxxg1633xxx  agonist) dosedependently decreased operant responding for both ethanol
and water, whereas continuous infusion of enadolin for
4 days increased free-access ethanol drinking and preference, especially a high concentration of ethanol, in
chronically (>16 months)  xxxd102xxx drinking rats (holter et
al. 2000). bremazocine also reduced responding for
ethanol, saccharin, and food under a fixed ratio schedule
in rhesus monkeys (cosgrove and carroll 2002). bremazocine has similar affinities for both µ and kappa receptors in
vitro (lahti et al. 1982), while it has weak delta opioid actions
(richards and sadee 1985). however, behaviorally,
u50488h was cross-tolerant with bremazocine but not
with morphine (lahti et al. 1982). similarly, an in vivo
comparison study (vonvoigtlander et al. 1983) shows that,
while chronic morphine produced tolerance to the analgesic
effect of itself by the 5.9-fold increase of an ed50 dose in
mice, it did not produce cross-tolerance with u50488 and
bremazocine. in contrast, chronic u50488 produced tolerance with itself and bremazocine by the 26-fold and over
12.5-fold increases of ed50 doses, respectively, whereas it
did not produce cross-tolerance with morphine. this
finding suggests that, despite similar affinities of bremazocine at µ and kappa receptors in vitro, in vivo actions of
bremazocine is similar to those of u50488, a selective kappa
agonist but not to those of morphine.
collectively, acute treatment with kappa agonists appears to
decrease ethanol drinking and non-selectively decrease

125

operant responding, although continuous infusion of a kappa
agonist might enhance the rewarding effect of ethanol
based on one study (holter et al. 2000). note that the kappa
opioid system has been associated with feeding and
drinking (see above). therefore, the results with kappa agonists
using a free-access drinking paradigm may involve more
general appetitive actions. additionally, it is suggested that
the kappa opioid system may affect ingestive behaviors by
mediating palatability, especially sweet taste (beczkowska
et al. 1993; lynch et al. 1985; woolley et al. 2007),
although the effect of kappa agonists on bitter taste like alcohol
hasn't yet been studied. using conditioned place preference
(cpp), it was shown that the dose of u50488 (1 mg/kg),
that produced place aversion, decreased stress (foot shock
or fear stress)-induced ethanol place preference, while norbni had no effect or enhanced it in rats (matsuzawa et al.
1998, 1999). these results suggest again that the kappa opioid
system may antagonize the rewarding effect of ethanol by
producing an aversive effect rather than by directly
modulating the rewarding mechanism of ethanol. however,
logrip et al. (2009) has recently demonstrated that u50488,
a kappa agonist (1, 3 mg/kg), inhibited  xxxd102xxx induced cpp
under the condition in which the drug did not produce place
aversion, suggesting actual modulation of the rewarding
effects of ethanol.
under conditions of dependence, the role of kappa receptors
on the reinforcing effect of ethanol may shift. in a
nondependent state, nor-bni had no effect on operant
responding for ethanol in rats and monkeys (doyon et al.
2006; williams and woods 1998). in a free-drinking
paradigm, nor-bni increased unlimited access ethanol
drinking in high-drinking rats (approx. 1.5 g/kg ethanol
intake) (mitchell et al. 2005), whereas it decreased 18 h
ethanol drinking in mice (logrip et al. 2008). to induce
ethanol dependence especially within a short period (in
2 weeks), it is necessary to maintain blood alcohol level
(bal) at 150–200 mg% (gilpin et al. 2008; o’dell et al.
2004), which is difficult to be achieved by voluntary ethanol
intake (binge-like drinking, approx. 1.5 g/kg, 80 mg% bal)
(ji et al. 2008). however, a prolonged exposure to ethanol
intake might also induce a dependence-like state. in
chronically (>16 months)  xxxd102xxx drinking rats, nor-bni
clearly decreased the 24-h withdrawal-induced increase in
first-hour ethanol intake under a fixed ratio schedule but not
free-access ethanol drinking (holter et al. 2000). similarly,
nor-bni significantly attenuated the withdrawal-induced
increase in ethanol intake under a fixed ratio schedule in
 xxxd102xxx dependent rats but not in nondependent rats (walker
and koob 2008).
time course of the action of nor-bni can be critical for
interpretation of results. nor-bni can act on both µ and kappa
receptors, but the µ action of a single injection of nor-bni
is short-lived (<1 day, spanagel et al. 1994; <1 h after an

126

icv injection, horan et al. 1992), while kappa actions last long.
for example, the antagonism of kappa opioid antinociceptive
effects by a single injection of nor-bni is reported to last
more than 21 days in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys
(butelman et al. 1993; horan et al. 1992; jones and
holtzman 1992). moreover, it is shown that up to
20 mg/kg of nor-bni (s.c.) selectively antagonized the kappa
antinociceptive effect of u50488 in mice without influencing the antinociceptive effects of µ and  xxxg1632xxx  agonists
(takemori et al. 1988). regarding repeated injections,
spanagel et al. (1994) reported that chronic nor-bni was
able to block the µ and  xxxg1632xxx -mediated antinociception
only 1 and 2 days after the last injection while it was able to
do so at kappa receptors over 20 days, which again suggests a
short µ action of repeated nor-bni. therefore, under
conditions of the cited studies (one injection with a long
pretreatment), nor-bni may have acted as a selective kappa
antagonist.
collectively, while activation of the kappa opioid system may
have a general suppressant effect on ethanol reinforcement
in nondependent animals, the endogenous kappa opioid system
may contribute to the motivation to seek ethanol in a
dependent state (fig. 1).
psychostimulants
extensive studies on the effects of the kappa opioid system on
cocaine actions have been performed. in studies of
psychostimulant self-administration, acute and continuous
activation of kappa receptors decreased cocaine selfadministration under a fixed ratio schedule, respectively,
in rats (glick et al. 1995; schenk et al. 1999) and monkeys
(mello and negus 1998; negus et al. 1997). however,
decreased cocaine self-administration was observed only
with low cocaine doses and was associated with a
concomitant decrease in responding for food (mello and
negus 1998; negus et al. 1997; schenk et al. 1999).
u69593, a kappa agonist, decreased cocaine self-administration
that was presented with a cue light in rats (schenk et al.
2001), but failed to do so consistently in rats that were
trained to self-administer cocaine without a cue light
(schenk et al. 2001). specifically, the kappa agonist initially
decreased responding for cocaine for an hour after the
injection in both groups with and without a cue light.
however, the suppressed responding for cocaine gradually
recovered to the baseline within 4 h in rats without a cue
light, which suggests that kappa agonist initially exerted nonspecific effect on responding. however, the kappa agonist
consistently reduced cocaine intake in rats trained with a
cue light, which may suggest the specific effect of the kappa
agonist on the conditioned reinforcement of cue rather than
unconditioned drug reinforcement. the finding that daily
treatment with u69593 had no effect on the acquisition of

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:121–135

cocaine self-administration in rats (schenk et al. 2001) further
supports the lack of a major effect of kappa agonists on the acute
reinforcing mechanism of cocaine. in contrast, u50488, a kappa
agonist, produced the leftward-shifted dose–response function
of cocaine self-administration (7–60 µg/infusion) in naïve rats
(kuzmin et al. 1997). specifically, the leftward shift was
observed when u50488 at the highest dose tested enhanced
the sensitivity of the animals to the reinforcing effect of very
low doses of cocaine while the drug decreased selfadministration of 30 µg/infusion of cocaine in a dosedependent manner. similarly, pseudo-continuous intravenous
administration of u50488 dose-dependently shifted the
choice dose–response function of cocaine to the left under a
concurrent choice paradigm with food pellets in monkeys, an
effect that was attenuated by nor-bni (negus 2004),
suggesting the increased sensitivity of the animals to the
reinforcing effects of cocaine. overall, the data suggest that kappa
agonists decreased cocaine intake not by playing a specific
role in the reinforcing mechanisms of cocaine, but perhaps by
producing a non-specific effect on responding and that kappa
agonists can also enhance the sensitivity of animals to the
reinforcing effect of cocaine under certain conditions.
savinorin a, a kappa agonist, did not decrease responding for
10% sucrose (morani et al. 2009), which might argue against
the general non-specific effect of kappa agonists on responding.
however, salvinorin a is a psychomimetic and hallucinogenic kappa agonist with abuse potential, which is quite different
from other kappa agonists. moreover, it is shown that salvinorin a
is reinforcing and rewarding (braida et al. 2008; braida et al.
2007), ruling out the generalization of salvinorin a to kappa
agonists.
nor-bni, a kappa antagonist, had no effect on cocaine selfadministration in rats (glick et al. 1995) and monkeys (negus
2004; negus et al. 1997). one study showed that, only at
low doses of cocaine, nor-bni shifted the dose–response
function of cocaine self-administration to the right in rats
(kuzmin et al. 1998), suggesting the decreased sensitivity of
animals to the reinforcing effects of cocaine. in rats with
extended access to cocaine, a hypothesized rodent model of
cocaine dependence, 15 mg/kg of nor-bni, the dose with a
selective kappa action, significantly decreased cocaine selfadministration under a pr schedule only in lga rats 5 days
after the injection (wee et al. 2009). however, when the dose
of nor-bni increased to 30 mg/kg, a high dose with µ and kappa
actions, the drug significantly decreased cocaine selfadministration only in sha rats right after the injection, a
time point when µ actions of the drug were effective,
whereas it did so only in lga rats at the time points when
selective kappa actions of the drug were effective (wee et al.
2009). therefore, while acute stimulation of kappa receptors may
suppress cocaine self-administration, increased activation of
the kappa opioid system may contribute to the reinforcing actions
of cocaine in cocaine dependence (fig. 1).

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:121–135

in a cpp paradigm, a similar pattern was observed.
activation of kappa receptors was shown to block cocaineinduced cpp in rodents (crawford et al. 1995; mori et al.
2002; zhang et al. 2004). in a time-course study, however,
u50488 enhanced cocaine-induced cpp when injected
60 min before cocaine conditioning, a time interval in
which u50488 did not produce place aversion on its own,
while it decreased cocaine-induced cpp when injected
15 min before cocaine conditioning, a time interval in
which u50488 produced place aversion on its own
(mclaughlin et al. 2006a). co-pretreatment of cocaine
with kappa agonists (u50488, u69593) selectively abolished
cocaine pretreatment-induced potentiation of cocaine cpp
in rats (shippenberg et al. 1996, 1998). on the other hand,
nor-bni had no effect on cocaine-induced cpp in sham
rats, whereas it restored cocaine-induced cpp in rats that
showed aversion to cocaine-associated chamber after
creb overexpression (carlezon et al. 1998). therefore,
similar to the self-administration data, it appears that the
stimulation of kappa receptors antagonizes the rewarding effects
of cocaine in cpp, perhaps by producing aversive effects
although it can also enhance the rewarding effects of
cocaine under a certain conditions. consistent with this
conclusion, in an intracranial self-stimulation paradigm,
u69593 alone attenuated brain stimulation in rats, suggestive of a dysphoria-like state (todtenkopf et al. 2004), and
also antagonized cocaine-induced facilitation of brain
stimulation in rats (tomasiewicz et al. 2008).
nicotine and cannabinoids
data on the role of the kappa opioid system in the reinforcing
effects of nicotine and cannabinoid are scarce. one study
showed that  xxxg1722xxx  deletion slightly enhanced the
sensitivity of mice to the reinforcing effect of nicotine
(galeote et al. 2009). however, gene deletion had no effect
on nicotine-induced cpp and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in mice (galeote et al. 2009). in one study, u50488
attenuated  xxxd2550xxx -precipitated nicotine withdrawalinduced place aversion in rats (ise et al. 2002). with respect
to cannabinoids, it was shown that  xxxd1943xxx  (delta9-thc)-induced place aversion was abolished in
dynorphin knockout mice and  xxxg1633xxx  knockout mice
implying an involvement of the kappa opioid system in the
dysphoric component of delta9-thc (ghozland et al. 2002;
zimmer et al. 2001). consistent with this observation, norbni and  xxxg1722xxx  knockout enhanced, respectively,
the acquisition of self-administration of win 55,212-2, a
cannabinoid agonist, and the sensitivity of the reinforcing
effect of the cannabinoid agonist in mice (mendizabal et al.
2006), suggesting that the inhibition of the kappa opioid system
may enhanced the reinforcing effect of win 55,212-2 by
attenuating dysphoric-like effects of cannabinoids. further

research with animal models of nicotine dependence
(o'dell et al. 2007) and cannabinoid self-administration
are merited.

effect of the kappa opioid system on reinstatement
of responding for drug self-administration
data on the effects of kappa agonists on reinstatement of
extinguished responding for drug self-administration or
cpp give a clearer view of the actions of kappa agonists. an
acute pretreatment with u69593 decreased cocaine- or
amphetamine-primed reinstatement of responding for cocaine or amphetamine, respectively (schenk and partridge
2001; schenk et al. 1999). however, u69593 did not alter
the ability of other psychostimulants (amphetamine,
gbr12909, win35428) to reinstate responding for cocaine
self-administration in rats (schenk et al. 1999, 2000). in
contrast, kappa agonists themselves reinstated responding for
cocaine, an effect that was blocked by naltrexone and a
crf1 receptor antagonist in monkeys (valdez et al. 2007).
moreover, kappa antagonists inhibited stress-induced, but not
cocaine-primed, reinstatement of responding for cocaine in
rats (beardsley et al. 2005). similarly, u50488, a kappa agonist,
induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-associated
place preference (redila and chavkin 2008), and kappa
antagonists inhibited stress-induced, but not cocaineprimed, reinstatement of cocaine-associated cpp in mice
(carey et al. 2007; redila and chavkin 2008). additionally,
genetic deletion of kappa receptors or  xxxg1722xxx  also
abolished stress-induced reinstatement of cpp in mice
(redila and chavkin 2008). therefore, the data clearly
suggest that the kappa opioid system plays a role in stressinduced drug seeking, and stimulation or inhibition of kappa
receptors, respectively, induces or inhibits drug seeking
via stress responses in laboratory animals. the reinstatement data further suggest that stress responses induced by
kappa agonists may underscore the observed increase in
animals' sensitivity to the reinforcing/rewarding effect of
cocaine by kappa agonists in some studies (kuzmin et al.
1997; mclaughlin et al. 2006a; negus 2004).

neural mechanisms of the dynorphin/kappa opioid system
in the interactions with the reinforcing effects of drugs
the activation of the dynorphin system in the nucleus
accumbens has been associated with activation of the
dopamine system by cocaine and amphetamine. activation
of dopamine d1 receptors stimulates a cascade of events
that ultimately leads to  xxxd1773xxx 
response element binding protein (creb) phosphorylation
and subsequent alterations in gene expression, notably

128

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:121–135

activation of  xxxg2240xxx  expression and  xxxg1722xxx 
mrna in the nucleus accumbens. subsequent activation of
the dynorphin system is hypothesized to decrease dopamine
release via a negative feedback loop (nestler 2004). the kappa
opioid system exerts tonic influences on dopamine neurons
in the nucleus accumbens (chefer et al. 2005), whereas it
has no tonic activity on dopamine neurons in the ventral
tegmental area (margolis et al. 2006; spanagel et al. 1992).
studies show that kappa agonists decrease dopamine release or
dopamine neuron activity in the nucleus accumbens
(maisonneuve et al. 1994; spanagel et al. 1992; xi et al.
1998), ventral tegmental area (margolis et al. 2003), and
prefrontal cortex (heijna et al. 1990; margolis et al. 2006),
whereas nor-bni produce the opposite effect in the nucleus
accumbens (spanagel et al. 1992). similarly, a microdialysis study demonstrated that acute stimulation of kappa
receptors attenuated cocaine-evoked dopamine release in
the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (gehrke et al.
2008). repeated administration of u69593 for 3 days
decreased the level of d2 receptors in the nucleus
accumbens (izenwasser et al. 1998). the involvement of
d1 receptors in the dysphoric actions of the kappa opioid system
has also been demonstrated in rats (shippenberg and herz
1988). therefore, the inhibitory actions of the kappa opioid
system on dopamine release, particularly in the ventral
striatum, are postulated to underlie the behavioral effects of
 xxxg1633xxx  ligands. a key role of creb in mediating the
dysphoric-like and depressive-like effects of kappa agonists was
the observation that the effect of u50488 on icss thresholds was absent in mutant mice expressing dominantnegative creb (dinieri et al. 2009).
however, the behavioral effects of kappa agonists do not
appear to solely result from actions within the dopamine
system. for example, although a single treatment of

dynorphin or salvinorin a decreased dopamine release in
the dorsal striatum (zhang et al. 2004, 2005), three to five
repeated injections of kappa agonists had either no effect or
augmented cocaine-, amphetamine-, and k+-evoked dopamine release (fuentealba et al. 2006, 2007; gehrke et al.
2008; heidbreder et al. 1998). additionally, three days of
u69593 administration had no effect on basal dopamine
dynamics in rats although it attenuated the quinpirole (a d2
agonist)-induced decrease of dopamine level (acri et al.
2001) while it potentiated quinpirole -induced locomotor
sensitization in rats (perreault et al. 2006). more importantly, whereas kappa agonists can reinstate responding for
extinguished cocaine self-administration, dopamine antagonists only inhibit context- or cocaine-induced reinstatement of responding for cocaine (anderson et al. 2003,
2006; crombag et al. 2002). therefore, the behavioral
effects of kappa agonists are unlikely to be mediated only by
actions within the dopamine system. the kappa opioid system
can also modulate glutamate and  xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) release in the striatum (hjelmstad and fields
2001, 2003; rawls and mcginty 1998). thus, this action
may contribute to some of behavioral effects of  xxxg1633xxx 
ligands.
one hypothesis that has gained support (bruchas et al.
2009; shippenberg 2009) is that the aversive and stress-like
effects produced by the stimulation of kappa receptors are
responsible for the antagonism of the reinforcing/rewarding
effects of drugs and the reinstatement of drug seeking.
stress has been strongly associated with relapse to
compulsive drug use in drug addiction (koob 2009). the
kappa opioid system has been implicated in behavioral
responses to stress (knoll and carlezon 2009). moreover,
the crf system has long been implicated in drug addiction
(koob 1999a, b, 2008; koob et al. 1993), and valdez et al.

(2007) showed that a crf1 receptor antagonist inhibited kappa
agonist-induced reinstatement of responding for cocaine in
monkeys. furthermore, land et al. (2008) showed that norbni inhibited swim stress-conditioned aversion of neutral
odorant, whereas the drug had no effect on cocaineconditioned preference of the odorant in mice, which
strongly supports the role of the kappa opioid system in an
aversive, rather than rewarding, mechanism. additionally,
nor-bni and  xxxg1722xxx  deletion inhibited footshockinduced and crf-induced place aversion in mice (land et
al. 2008). these results support the role of the kappa opioid
system in stress responses through an interaction with the
crf system. whether crf drives dynorphin and/or
dynorphin drives crf remains to be elucidated under
different conditions.
the serotonergic system may also play a role in the
dysphoric-like effects of activation of the kappa opioid system. a
local injection of damgo, a mu agonist, increased serotonin
release in the dorsal raphe nucleus, whereas a local injection of
u50488, a kappa agonist, decreased it (tao and auerbach 2005).
crf administration activated kappa receptors in the dorsal raphe
nucleus in addition to the basolateral amygdala, dorsal
hippocampus, ventral pallidum, ventral tegmental amygdala,
nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (land
et al. 2008), and the local inhibition of kappa receptors in the
dorsal raphe nucleus abolished stress-induced enhancement
of analgesia and reinstatement of cocaine-associated cpp in
mice (land et al. 2009). similarly, kappa receptors in the dorsal
raphe nucleus were hypothesized to be responsible for the
aversive effect of u50488 in mice (land et al. 2009).

adaptations in the dynorphin/kappa opioid system
during chronic exposure to drugs of abuse
in postmortem studies of cocaine abusers, increased
immunoreactivity of dynorphin or kappa receptors in the
caudate and ventral pallidum was found, which suggests
an upregulated kappa opioid system in cocaine dependence
(frankel et al. 2008; hurd and herkenham 1993; staley et
al. 1997). similarly, cocaine self-administration or administration increased  xxxg1722xxx  mrna in the striatum of
rats and monkeys (daunais et al. 1993; fagergren et al.
2003; hurd et al. 1992; schlussman et al. 2005). in alcohol
self-administration/administration,  xxxg1722xxx  mrna
and the release of  xxxg1722xxx -derived peptides were
shown to increase in the nucleus accumbens of rats during
early and protracted ethanol withdrawal (lindholm et al.
2000; przewlocka et al. 1997). prolonged heroin selfadministration (6 weeks) also significantly increased  xxxg1722xxx  mrna expression in the central nucleus of
amygdala and nucleus accumbens shell but not in the dorsal
striatum and nucleus accumbens core, in rats (solecki et al.
2009). this increased kappa opioid activity induced by abused
drugs is consistent with manifestation of withdrawal-related
negative emotional states in drug addiction (fig. 1).
consequently, although kappa agonists can acutely antagonize
the reinforcing effects of abused drugs, presumably in part
via an action to decrease dopamine release (nestler 2001),
the use of kappa antagonists may be beneficial in treating drug
addiction by antagonizing motivational withdrawal symptoms, thereby reducing relapse to drug use, a core symptom

of drug addiction. one clinical study tested the hypothesis
that the potent kappa antagonism of buprenorphine combined
with naltrexone would improve compliance compared with
naltrexone treatment alone (gerra et al. 2006). the results
showed significantly enhanced compliance and drug abstinence from heroin and cocaine compared with naltrexone
alone in heroin-dependent humans (gerra et al. 2006).
these findings were postulated to be attributable to less
aversive responses of the buprenorphine/naltrexone combination compared with naltrexone alone. this study further
supports the hypothesis of the therapeutic potential of kappa
antagonists in drug addiction.

summary
findings in conditioned place preference/aversion and intracranial self-stimulation studies clearly indicate that kappa agonists
produce, respectively, aversive-like and dysphoric-like effects
in laboratory animals. data in stress-induced reinstatement of
cpp or responding for a drug corroborate the stress-like effect
of kappa agonists. consistent findings in drug self-administration
and drug-induced cpp studies are that the stimulation of kappa
receptors generally antagonizes the reinforcing/rewarding
effects of cocaine, morphine, heroin, and ethanol, whereas kappa
receptor blockade has no consistent effect (table 2). these
observations suggest that the kappa opioid system is not directly
involved in the reinforcing/rewarding mechanism but modulates them by producing punishing/aversive effects. under
certain conditions, however, kappa agonists can enhance the
sensitivity of animals to the reinforcing or rewarding effect
of cocaine. considering that stress can also enhance the
sensitivity to the reinforcing (covington et al. 2005;
covington and miczek 2001) and rewarding effect of a drug
(mclaughlin et al. 2003), the enhanced sensitivity may
result from the stress-like effects of kappa agonists (mclaughlin
et al. 2006b). in a drug-dependent-like state associated with
compulsive drug use,  xxxg1633xxx  blockade was effective in
reducing the increased intake of ethanol and cocaine
(table 3). the role of the kappa opioid system in physical
withdrawal symptoms of morphine and nicotine was
equivocal suggesting that the increase of drug intake during
the development of drug dependence may be related to the kappa
opioid-mediated development of negative emotional states.
thus, when a state of drug dependence is reached, the
inhibition of kappa receptors may be effective in attenuating
compulsive drug intake. consistent with this hypothesis, the
data from animal models of reinstatement indicate that the kappa
receptor stimulation can induce reinstatement of drug
seeking by producing stress-like effects in animals (table 4).
consequently, the inhibition of the kappa opioid system is a
potential target for blocking compulsive drug use and
vulnerability to relapse during drug abstinence.
