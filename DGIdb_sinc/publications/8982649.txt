abstract

in vivo microdialysis in rat ventral hippocampus was used (i) to verify the importance of 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the raphe as targets
for drugs that enhance the citalopram-induced elevation of forebrain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), and (ii) to further examine the
specificity of (-)- xxxd2869xxx  in this regard. the selective 5-htia receptor antagonist way100635 (s.c., or intra-raphe) or the mixed
5-ht~a/~b/13-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)- xxxd2869xxx  (s.c.), potentiated the citalopram-induced 5-ht rise, whereas local 'reverse'
dialysis of way100635 into the ventral hippocampus did not. furthermore, the (-)- xxxd2869xxx -induced augmentation proved stereoselective and not mediated by 13-adrenoceptors (no effect of s.c. (+)- xxxd2869xxx , or 13l- and 132-adrenoceptor blockers (betaxoloi,
ici118.551)). these data provide direct evidence that increased stimulation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the midbrain raphe impedes the
effect of citalopram on forebrain extracellular 5-ht, whereas neither postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors nor ~-adrenoceptors appear to be
involved.

1. introduction

previous in vivo microdialysis studies have indicated
that systemic administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht) reuptake blockers may elevate extracellular levels of
5-ht more in the midbrain raphe than in corresponding
forebrain projections, tentatively due to a concomitant
increase in autoreceptor tone (adell et al., 1991; bel and
artigas, 1992). subsequent work suggested that the 5-htia
autoreceptors, in particular, may be responsible for restraining the elevation of extracellular 5-ht induced by
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) like citalopram. however, the results of these latter studies are
incomplete, since they involve the use of imperfect phar-

(hjorth, 1993) rather than direct intra-raphe drug administration. moreover, the potential contributions from postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors and [3-adrenoceptors in the
ssri-potentiating effects of selective 5-htia and mixed
5-htlg/13-adrenoceptor agents have not been addressed
previously. the purpose of the present experiments was
two-fold, (i) to complement and verify, by means of
subcutaneous (s.c.), intra-raphe or hippocampal 'reverse'dialysis administration of the new potent and selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, way100635 (forster et al.,
1995), the importance of 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the
raphe (vs. postsynaptic 5-htia receptors), as targets for
drugs that potentiate the citalopram-induced elevation of
extracellular 5-ht, and (ii) to further examine the specificity of the mixed 5-htia/1b and [3-adrenoceptor blocker
(-)- xxxd2869xxx  - in particular, with respect to stereoselectivity and involvement of [3-adrenoceptors - in this regard.

annual meeting of the scandinavian society for psychopharmacology (hjorth et al., 1996).

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
the studies were carried out in male sprague-dawley
rats (280-350 g; b & k universal, sollentuna, sweden).
the animals were housed in our animal quarters, 4 - 5 / c a g e
under controlled environmental conditions (temperature
22-25°c; humidity 55-65%; 14/10 h dark/light cycle,
lights on 06.00 a.m.; rat chow and tap water available ad
libitum) for at least one week after arrival until used in the
experiments. the experimental procedures were carried out
in accordance with international guidelines for care and
use of laboratory animals, and were approved by the
animal ethics committee of the university of g~steborg.
all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to
reduce the number of animals used in the experiments.

for the intra-raphe injection, a 250 ~zm od stainless
steel hollow guide cannula was stereotaxically implanted
at a lateral angle of 32 ° to the vertical off the midline, with
the cannula tip aimed at the border of the dorsa raphe
nucleus (ap - 7 . 8 , ml +0.2, dv - 6 . 0 vs. bregma and
dura surface; paxinos and watson, 1986), ipsilaterally to
the hippocampal dialysis probe. an injection unit, constructed from fused silica (sge, uk; 140/75 ~m od/id)
glued to polyethylene tubing and connected to a 5  xxxd1919xxx 
hamilton syringe, was inserted to the full depth of the
guide cannula. the hamilton syringe was placed in a
micro-perfusion syringe pump (md-1001; bas, w.
lafayette, in, usa) which delivered 1  xxxd1919xxx  of drug
(way100635) or saline solution over a period of 5 min;
after completion of the infusion, the injection unit was left
in position for the remainder of the experiment. immediately following the experiment, 1 ixl of fast green dye
solution was injected in the same manner, to aid in subsequent gross histological verification of the site of the
injection. only data obtained in rats where the dye spots
were found within the confines of the dorsa raphe nucleus
were included in the calculations.

2.2. drugs
2.4. statistics
citalopram (hbr; h. lundbeck, copenhagen-valby,
denmark), betaxolol (synthelabo, paris, france),
ici118.551 ( xxxd2033xxx -dl-l-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropyl-amino-butan-2-ol hc1; ici, macclesfield, uk),
( - ) - and (+)- xxxd2869xxx  hemisulphate (hoechst, stockholm, sweden) and way100635 (n-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-n-(pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide oxalate; courtesy dr. c. sanchez, h. lundbeck, copenhagen-valby, denmark) were dissolved in
0.9% saline and given subcutaneously (s.c.; either agent).
in some experiments, way100635 (in saline) was instead
administered directly into the dorsal raphe area, or dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) and applied
by 'reverse' dialysis into the ventral hippocampus (cf.
below).

the experimental data are expressed as absolute differences (fmol/20 ill sample) from the individual pre-injection 5-ht values (baseline). statistical analysis of the
overall responses in the different treatment groups was
carried out by means of a repeated measures analysis of
variance (anova) followed by fisher's protected least
significance differences (plsd) test, using statview 4.0
for the macintosh. probabilities of ~ 5% were considered
statistically significant.

3. results

2.3. microdialysis and raphe injection procedures

3.1. basal 5-ht levels, effect of citalopram alone

the microdialysis experiments were performed in chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats (initial dose 400 mg/kg, i.p.;
suppl, dosing - = 80-100 m g / k g / h - assured adequate
surgical anaesthesia for the remainder of the experiment),
as described elsewhere (hjorth and sharp, 1993; sharp et
al., 1989). a u-shaped microdialysis probe, continuously
perfused with acsf (composition: see e.g. hjorth, 1993),
was implanted in the ventral hippocampus, with the probe
tip at ap - 4 . 8 , ml +4.6, dv - 8 . 5 vs. bregma and dura
surface (paxinos and watson, 1986). twenty-minute
dialysates were collected and immediately analysed for
5-ht by standard hplc-ec methods (hjorth, 1993). stable baseline dialysate levels of 5-ht were typically obtained 2 - 4 h after probe implantation.

the average basal 5-ht levels in the dialysates were
6.7 + 0.5 fmol/20 ixl sample (n = 35). the present data
represent results from two separate experimental series: (1)
citalopram plus way100635 (s.c. injection, intra-dorsa
raphe nucleus or hippocampus infusion), and (2) citalopram plus  xxxd2869xxx  isomers or betaxolol/ic 118.551. as
seen in figs. 1 and 2, citalopram (5 mg/kg, s.c.) consistently elevated the ventral hippocampal dialysate 5-ht
levels throughout, although the absolute magnitude of the
increase in the citalopram control groups varied slightly
between the two experimental series. by and large, the
maximum elevation induced by citalopram corresponded
to about a doubling of the initial pre-injection baseline
values.

as shown in fig. 1a, the citalopram-induced rise in
dialysate 5-ht was clearly potentiated by way100635
(0.3 m g / k g , s.c.), administered 1 h after the reuptake
inhibitor, the resulting levels being approximately 4 times
the initial, pre-citalopram, baseline value. this dose of
way100635 did not significantly change the 5-ht output
when given alone (fig. 1a).

fig. 1. effect of systemic, intra-raphe or intra-hippocampal administration
of way100635 on the citalopram-induced elevation of extracellular
5-ht. (a) citalopram (5 mg/kg, s.c.) was given at time zero (lst arrow),
and way100635 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) 1 h thereafter (2nd arrow). a separate
group received wayi00635 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) only, at time zero. (b)
citalopram (5 mg/kg, s.c.) was given at time zero (lst arrow), and,
starting 1 h thereafter (2nd arrow), wayi00635 was either injected into
the dorsa raphe nucleus (drn; 1 i~g in 1 p.1), or applied by 'reverse'
dialysis (10 ixm via the perfusion medium for 2 h) into the hippocampus.
each point represents the mean + s.e.m. of 3-6 observations. the dashed

way100635, but not by the intra-hippocampal 'reverse'-dialysis application of the compound.

4. discussion
the results of this study extend and validate previous
observations by our group and others concerning the involvement of 5-ht autoreceptors in the short-term restraint of the 5-ht-promoting action of citalopram. specifically, the present data provide direct evidence that citalopram's effect is impeded by increased stimulation of cell
body 5-htia autoreceptors (secondary to raised extracellular 5-ht levels) in the midbrain raphe. thus, the local
administration into the dorsa raphe nucleus of
wayi00635, a new selective 5-ht]a receptor blocker
(forster et al., 1995), strongly augmented the capacity of
systemically given citalopram to increase extracellular levels of 5-ht in the ventral hippocampus. although we

46

s. hjorth et al. / european journal of pharmacology 316 (1996) 43-47

cannot entirely exclude that way100365 also diffused to
areas outside the dorsa raphe nucleus in our studies, it
should be noted that the local application of way100635
by 'reverse' dialysis in the hippocampus was ineffective,
arguing against the involvement of postsynaptic 5-htia
receptors in this area. these data thus extend previous
reports, where less selective drugs or systemic rather than
intra-raphe drug administration (hjorth, 1993; invernizzi et
al., 1992) were used to potentiate the 5-ht-elevating
action of citalopram. also consistent with this are recent
findings that the reduction in frontal cortical 5-ht release
elicited by intra-raphe infusion of citalopram is antagonized by the systemic administration of way100635
(romero and artigas, personal communication), and that
this antagonist offsets the inhibitory action of paroxetine
(both drugs given systemically) on 5-ht neuronal firing in
the dorsa raphe nucleus, and, at the same time, promotes
the elevation of extracellular 5-ht in the rat frontal cortex
(gartside et al., 1995). (it should be noted that the ability
of 5-htia receptor blocking drugs to enhance the ssri-induced elevation of 5-ht output is not dependent on whether
or not anaesthetized animals are used (cf., e.g., dreshfield
et al., 1996).)
the present data additionally show that the ability of
the 5-ht1a + 1b receptor antagonist (-)- xxxd2869xxx  to promote the 5-ht response to citalopram (hjorth, 1993) (cf.
fig. 2) is stereoselective, and is not due to its [3-adrenoceptor blocking properties. thus, whereas (-)- xxxd2869xxx 
causes a marked accentuation of the rise in extracellular
5-ht following citalopram, an identical dose of the inactive isomer - (+)- xxxd2869xxx  - failed to do so. further, a
combination of the potent lipophilic [3i- and [32-adrenoceptor blocking agents betaxolol and ici118.551, respectively,
which lack  xxxg1108xxx  affinity (middlemiss et al.,
1985), did not significantly alter the citalopram response.
it is well established that drugs which enhance 5-ht
neurotransmission are effective in the treatment of depression. current theory assumes that a net rise in 5-ht
availability is important for clinical efficacy. in particular,
the mechanism of action of drugs like citalopram has been
proposed to involve a sustained increase in agonistic tone
at, and thus a gradual down-regulation of, raphe 5-htia
autoreceptors during prolonged 5-ht reuptake blockade corresponding to the 2-3 week delay typically required for
a therapeutic response to occur (blier et al., 1987; chaput
et al., 1991). logically, the direct drug-induced blockade
of 5-htia autoreceptors should be functionally comparable to a desensitization of these sites. if the above is
correct, it can thus be expected that co-treatment with
5-htia autoreceptor blocking drugs would avoid the therapeutic time lag of 5-ht reuptake-blocking antidepressants,
and possibly also enhance their effectiveness in refractory
patients. interestingly, the results of recently reported open
clinical studies are consistent with this idea. in patients
with unipolar major depression, the addition of the 5-ht~a
receptor (/[3-adrenoceptor) antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  to antide-

pressant medication with 5-ht reuptake blocking agents
resulted in an accelerated onset of action, and remission of
depression also in previously treatment-refractory patients
(artigas et al., 1994; blier and bergeron, 1995; hjorth et
al., in preparation).
in summary, our data corroborate the conclusion that
indirect stimulation of 5-htia autoreceptors - secondary
to increased extracellular 5-ht in the raphe cell body areas
- limits the overall 5-ht transmission-promoting action of
ssri; postsynaptic 5-htia receptors and [3-adrenoceptors
do not appear involved. the data are thus also relevant to
the aforementioned clinical strategy to use  xxxd2957xxx  to
augment the efficacy and accelerate the onset of action of
5-ht reuptake blockers in the treatment of depression.
based on current hypotheses, selective 5-htia autoreceptor antagonists, or novel drugs carrying both 5-ht reuptake and 5-ht~a autoreceptor blocking properties, may be
anticipated to become of clinical value as augmentation
treatment or mono-therapy, respectively, in the management of conditions with presumed 5-ht deficiency, such
as depression. however, as yet no such agents are available for clinical use. meanwhile, it might therefore be
suggested that not only  xxxd2957xxx , but also  xxxd2869xxx , and
possibly other similar-acting agents, could be tried as
augmentation therapy in combination with 5-ht reuptakeblocking drugs.
