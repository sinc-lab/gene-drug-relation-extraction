abstract:  xxxd1722xxx  is a second generation of  xxxd2705xxx  analogues designed to combine the most favorable
pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine.  xxxd1722xxx  acts by inhibiting dna polymerases and ribonucleotide reductase as well as by inducing apoptosis in cycling and non-cycling cells. phase i/ii clinical studies revealed its
efficacy in hematological malignancies, and in 2004  xxxd1722xxx  was approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least two prior
chemotherapy regimens. the mechanism of action, pharmacology and clinical activity of  xxxd1722xxx  is the subject of this
review.

key words:  xxxd1722xxx ,  xxxd2705xxx  analogues, mechanism of action, clinical application, acute leukemia.
introduction
for the last few years  xxxd2705xxx  analogues
(pnas), such as cladribine ( xxxd1712xxx ) and  xxxd2120xxx  (fa)
(fig. 1), have been approved by united states food and
drug administration (fda) for the treatment of hematological malignancies [1-3]. these drugs have chemical structure
similar to adenosine (ado) or deoxyadenosine (dado) and
are made up a purine base which is linked to a deoxyribose
sugar through a glycosidic bond [4]. deactivation of pnas
occurs through deamination by  xxxg62xxx  (ada)
and by cleavage of the glycosidic bond by the enzyme purine
 xxxg1792xxx  (pnp) [4-6]. since these drugs
were susceptible to glycosidic bond cleavage, with  xxxd2120xxx  subject to some phosphorylase cleavage and cladribine subject to hydrolytic and enzymatic cleavage, a search
for compounds overcame this limitation have developed [7,
8].  xxxd1722xxx  ( xxxd1722xxx ) (fig. 1) is a second generation of
pnas which has been designed to combine the most favorable pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine. the structure of  xxxd1722xxx , similarly to  xxxd1712xxx , consists of
deoxyadenosine with substitution of hydrogen by chlorine at
the 2-position of the adenine ring causing electronic changes
that make the amino group resistant to deamination by ada
[9]. substitution of a fluorine atom at the arabinosyl configuration at the 2’-position of the carbohydrate decreased the
susceptibility of  xxxd1722xxx  to phosphorolytic cleavage by pnp
(fig. 1). additionally, it makes  xxxd1722xxx  more acid stable and
leads to an increase of its oral bioavailability [10].  xxxd1722xxx  shows significant efficacy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) patients and was approved by the

us fda in december 2004 ( xxxd1722xxx , genzyme) and by the
european commission in may 2006 ( xxxd1722xxx ®, bioenvision)
for the treatment of relapsed or refractory all in children
after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. in adults,
 xxxd1722xxx  is also active in acute myeloid leukemia (aml),
myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) and chronic myelogenous
leukemia in blastic phase (cml-bp), both as a single agent
and in combination with other anticancer drugs [8, 11-14]. in
june 2008  xxxd1722xxx ® was approved in europe for the treatment of aml in elderly patients who have one or more of
the following: adverse cytogenetics, secondary aml, greater
than or equal to 70 years old or significant co-morbidities
and are therefore not considered suitable for intensive chemotherapy.
this review article summarizes current knowledge about
mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological
properties, clinical activity and toxicity of  xxxd1722xxx .
mechanism of action
the mechanism of action of  xxxd1722xxx  is well described
and is similar to that of cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx  [15-17].
 xxxd1722xxx  is a slightly lipophilic prodrug entering into cells
via active nucleoside-specific membrane transporters (nts),
and at higher concentration and longer exposure time, by
passive diffusion across lipid membranes [18]. recently, a
few different nts have been identified [18, 19]. three of
them were defined as human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hents) which are sodium-independent-facilitated
system and transport the nucleoside down the concentration
gradient. other three nts known as human concentrative
nucleoside transporters (hcnts) are sodium-dependent and
can transport nucleosides against the concentration gradient
[20]. hent1 and hent2 are found in plasma membranes
and hent1 is also present on mitochondrial membranes.
hent3 is associated with lysosomal/endosomal membranes

and its nucleoside transport activity is broadly selective and
proton-dependent [21]. the hcnts exhibit selective transport activity for pyrimidine nucleosides ( xxxg2129xxx ), purine
nucleosides ( xxxg2130xxx ), and both pyrimidine and purine nucleosides (hcnt3) [18]. nts are integral membrane proteins
responsible for mediating nucleosides and nucleobasis across
the cellular membrane and they accept only dephosphorylated forms of nucleosides.  xxxd1722xxx  is transported into the
intracellular compartments by hent1, hent2 and hcnt3
and with low activity by  xxxg2130xxx  [18, 20]. the importance of
membrane nts was suggested by results in cultured human
leukaemic cells in which the rate of  xxxd1722xxx  intake into
cells was about 10-fold higher in transport-competent than in
transport-deficient cells [8, 18]. additionally,  xxxd1722xxx 
was more cytotoxic to cells having the hent1 transport
process than either  xxxd1712xxx  or fa [18].
like other pnas,  xxxd1722xxx , after the uptake into the cells,
is converted by  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) to the 5’monophosphate metabolite, and then by mono- and diphosphokinases to the active 5’-triphosphate form ( xxxd1722xxx -tp).
human  xxxg611xxx  can phosphorylate the pyrimidine nucleoside
 xxxd1836xxx  (dcy) and the purine nucleosides deoxyadenosine (dado) and deoxyguanosine (dguo), with a much higher
activity for dc [22].  xxxg611xxx  phosphorylates  xxxd1722xxx  with a
50% lower michaelis-menten constant (km) but a 4-fold
higher maximum velocity (vmax) than the physiological substrate dcy [23, 24]. additionally,  xxxd1722xxx  was reported to
be more efficient substrate for purified recombinant  xxxg611xxx 
than fa and  xxxd1712xxx  [17, 23]. in lymphoid tissues, a high
ratio of  xxxg611xxx  to 5’-nucleotidase (5’-nt) activity favours the
accumulation of phosphorylated metabolites, however a substantial concentration of  xxxg611xxx  was also revealed in nonlymphoid tissues [25]. malignant cells were reported to have
higher  xxxg611xxx  concentrations than their normal counterparts
[26]. it is known that  xxxg611xxx  activity is augmented by dnasynthesis inhibitors and ribonucleotide reductase (rr) inhibitors, which reduce deoxynucleotide pools of  xxxd1836xxx  mono-, di-, and triphosphate (dcmp, dcdp, dctp)
and  xxxd1789xxx  (ctp) that are feedback inhibitors
of  xxxg611xxx  [25, 26]. since  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits rr, it has been suggested that this drug may increase cellular  xxxg611xxx  activity and
enhance its own activation [8].  xxxg611xxx  is
known to be rate-limiting enzyme for many of adenosine
analogues, but is not rate limiting with  xxxd1722xxx  and clo-

farabine 5’-monophosphate that serve as a reservoir for the
formation of 5’-triphosphate metabolites [27-29].  xxxd1722xxx  is also a good substrate of deoxyguanine kinase
(dgk), which may contribute to its role in mitochondrial
damage [24, 30]. the 5’-mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms
of  xxxd1722xxx  must be dephosphorylated by 5’-nt for transport
out of the cell. the cellular elimination kinetics of the phosphorylated metabolites of  xxxd1722xxx  showed triphasic kinetics
with a -half life of 8-24 hours and a -half life lasting more
than 24 hours which indicates prolonged cellular retention
[27]. additionally, the cellular retention of phosphorylated
 xxxd1722xxx  metabolites was longer than that of fa and  xxxd1712xxx 
[16, 23].
 xxxd1722xxx  acts via four mechanism of action: incorporation into dna and inhibition of dna polymerases, inhibition of rr, as well as induction of apoptosis (fig. 2) the
 xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate form ( xxxd1722xxx -tp) is required for its
cytotoxicity.  xxxd1722xxx , in contrast to other anticancer drugs
but similarly to the whole class of pnas, is active both in
mitotic and quiescent cell cycle phase [8, 31]. the cytotoxicity of  xxxd1722xxx -tp in the dividing cells is mainly due to the
inhibition of either dna polymerases or rr, leading to
disequilibrium in deoxynucleotide triphosphates pool and via
endonuclease activation results in dna strand breaks [16,
32]. the  xxxd1722xxx -tp inhibits dna polymerases, mainly polymerases  and , whereas dna polymerases  (involved
in dna repair process) and polymerase  (mitochondrial) are
much less sensitive to  xxxd1722xxx  [8, 32]. the incorporation of
the monophosphate of  xxxd1722xxx  into dna by dna polymerase  results in chain termination and strand breakage.  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate inhibits rr, presumably by binding to
the allosteric site on the regulatory subunit [8, 16]. the inhibition of rr in consequence reduces the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dntp) available for
dna synthesis, mainly dctp and  xxxd1148xxx  ( xxxd1148xxx ) but not  xxxd3364xxx  triphosphate (dttp)
[16]. the depletion of the dctp pool is sufficient to limit
dna synthesis, and reduction in  xxxd1148xxx  concentration allows
 xxxd1722xxx -tp to compete with  xxxd1148xxx  for incorporation into
dna [8, 16]. when the ratio of  xxxd1722xxx -tp to  xxxd1148xxx  is more
than 1,  xxxd1722xxx  monophosphate is preferentially inserted
into the end of the dna chain resulting in termination of
chain elongation [16, 27]. if this ratio is less than 1,  xxxd1722xxx  monophosphate is incorporated into the middle of

the dna structure leading to the inhibition of dna repair
[16, 27]. in comparison with fa and  xxxd1712xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits
more completely both rr and dna polymerases [17, 23].

should be also taken into consideration. however, it is still
little known about the induction of apoptosis via the death
receptor fas/ xxxg764xxx  [35].

 xxxd1722xxx  can also induce the apoptosis, and both p53dependent and p53-independent cytotoxicity mechanisms are
suggested [33]. it is known that p53 influences bax and
other proapoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial changes
typical for apoptosis, resulting in secretion of  xxxg569xxx 
from mitochondria to cytosol and its binding with procaspase-9 and  xxxg169xxx  (apoptotic protease activating factor1).  xxxg569xxx  release is a critical point during apoptosis,
however the mechanism by which it exits mitochondria is
not well understood.  xxxg169xxx ,  xxxg569xxx  and procaspase9 form a complex termed apoptosome which after binding
with  xxxd1722xxx -tp influences the activation of caspase-9 cascade and via dna condensation and fragmentation leads to
apoptosis (fig. 2) [30, 34]. additionally,  xxxd1722xxx -tp similarly to  xxxd1712xxx  can induce apoptosis by binding directly to
proteins located in mitochondrial membrane. on this way
 xxxd1722xxx -tp via mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(mpt) results in the release of either  xxxg569xxx  and formation of apoptosome, or apoptosis-inducing factor (aif)
leading to chromatine condensation and dna fragmentation
without caspase-9 cascade activation [9, 30]. thus, the direct
mitochondrial effects of  xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd1712xxx  may explain
why these drugs are toxic to cll cells at concentrations 510-fold lower than fa [9, 30]. apoptosis induced by
 xxxd1722xxx -tp is mainly mediated on the intrinsic pathway described above, nevertheless the role of the extrinsic pathway

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1722xxx  were evaluated both in
adult and pediatric patients in the phase i studies [11, 28,
36]. during the initial phase i clinical studies conducted in
patients with hematological malignancies and refractory
solid tumours the maximum tolerated doses (mtd) and the
dose-limiting toxicities (dlt) were assessed [28, 36, 37].
 xxxd1722xxx  was given as 1-hour infusion daily for 5 days, every
3 to 6 weeks. dose-escalation studies in acute leukemias
started at the dose of 7.5mg/m2, with escalation to 55mg/m2
daily for 5 days. since the dlt was a reversible hepatotoxicity at the dose of 55mg/m2, therefore the recommended dose
for phase ii studies was 40mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) for 5
days in patients with acute leukemias, mds and cml-bp
[28, 36]. in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lpds) and solid tumors, the dlt was myelosuppression at the dose of 15mg/m2, therefore  xxxd1722xxx  at the doses
of 2mg/m2 or 4mg/m2 i.v. daily for 5 days were recommended for phase ii clinical trials in these patients [37].
based on phase i studies conducted in pediatric patients with
relapsed and refractory all and aml,  xxxd1722xxx  at a dose of
52mg/m2 i.v. over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days was recommended [11]. the dlt was a reversible hepatotoxicity
and skin rash at 70mg/m2 i.v. daily for 5 days [38].

after administration of  xxxd1722xxx  at a dose of 40mg/m2 as a
1-hour i.v. infusion, the median plasma level of  xxxd1722xxx  was
1.0 m (range 0.26-1.94m) [36]. the peak level of  xxxd1722xxx 
in plasma occurred at the end of the infusion and, despite
heterogeneity among patients, a linear increase in plasma
 xxxd1722xxx  concentration with increasing doses was observed
[28].  xxxd1722xxx  was only 47% bound to plasma proteins,
predominantly to albumin and showed extensive tissue distribution, having a volume of distribution at steady state
(vdss) of 179 litre for a 40-kg patient (about 4.5 l per kg) [8,
28, 29].  xxxd1722xxx  appeared to be eliminated in a biphasic
manner with faster kinetics during the first 6 hours followed
by slower kinetics up to 24 hours [28, 36]. the elimination
half-lives were not calculated in the studies, however there
was a measurable plasma  xxxd1722xxx  concentration of 0.038
mm (range, 0.013 mm-0.11 mm) at 24 hours. the pathway
of elimination is primarily via renal excretion, and the renal
clearance was 10.8 l/h/m2 with 57% of the dose excreted
unchanged in the urine [8, 28, 29]. the total systemic clearance for  xxxd1722xxx  was 28.8 l/h/m2. compared with pediatric patients, adults showed lower clearance and smaller volume of distribution [8].
similar to plasma  xxxd1722xxx  levels, the concentration of
intracellular  xxxd1722xxx -tp measured in circulating leukemic
blasts varied among patients and the median value was 15
m with a range of less than 1 m to 44 m. a doseproportional accumulation was observed at lower doses but
this correlation was lost with no further increases for the
doses >30mg/m2 [36]. no differences were observed between myeloid and lymphoid leukemic blasts regarding the
retention of intracellular  xxxd1722xxx -tp [36]. it has been reported that in blast cells of responding patients, the accumulation of  xxxd1722xxx -tp was greater and retained more than
50% of the initial concentration of  xxxd1722xxx -tp at 24 hours
after first infusion of  xxxd1722xxx  [28, 36]. additionally, blast
cells from patients with aml or all treated with  xxxd1722xxx  retain more than a half of the initial concentration of
 xxxd1722xxx -tp for 24 hours, in contrast to the mean half-life
time (t1/2) of 8-10 hours for fa or  xxxd1712xxx  in similar patient
populations [28, 39]. dna synthesis was inhibited by 7590% at the end of infusion with  xxxd1722xxx  at doses ranging
from 22.5 to 55 mg/m2. a partial recovery of dna synthesis
was observed at 24 hours in blasts of patients treated with
22.5 and 30 mg/m2. when a dose of 40 and 55 mg/m2 was
used, the inhibition of dna synthesis was maintained for
more than 72 hours [12, 39].
clinical trials
 xxxd1722xxx  is the most promising pna in current clinical trials in pediatric and adult patients with hematological
malignancies. during phase i studies the antileukemic activity at tolerable doses was well established thus several phase
ii clinical trials with  xxxd1722xxx  alone or in combination
with other cytotoxic drugs have been recently conducted1,2,3.

 xxxd1722xxx  clinical trials in pediatric patients
jeha et al. [11] conducted a first pediatric patients trial of
 xxxd1722xxx  in relapsed or refractory all and aml. in total,
17 patients with all and 8 with aml were entered into this
study.  xxxd1722xxx ’s doses ranged from 11.25 to 70mg/m2
i.v. daily for 5 days. five patients (20%) achieved complete
response (cr), and 3 (12%) achieved partial response (pr),
for an overall response (or) rate of 32%. based on the results of phase i clinical trials with  xxxd1722xxx  in pediatric
patients with advanced leukamias, the mtd was established
as 52 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. the dlt was reversible hepatotoxicity and skin rash at 70mg/m2 i.v. per day for 5 days
[11].
a phase ii multicenter studies were performed in children
with refractory or relapsed all or aml. the or rate was
31% in all patients including 6 cr, 4 crp (complete response with incomplete platelet recovery), and 5 pr. in
aml patients the or rate was 26% (1 crp and 8pr). median survival was 42 weeks for responding all patients and
39 weeks for responding aml patients. the most  xxxd1722xxx -related adverse events were febrile neutropenia,
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, fever, skin rash, headache,
elevation in liver enzymes and bilirubin, infusion-related
flushing and anxiety*1.
in a phase ii, multicenter study, 61 children with refractory or relapsed acute all received  xxxd1722xxx  at a dose of 52
mg/m2 i.v. over 2 hours daily for 5 days, every 2 to 6 weeks
[40]. the response rate was 30%, consisting of 7 cr, 5 crp ,
and 6 pr. the most common adverse events of grade 3-4
were febrile neutropenia, anorexia, hypotention, and nausea.
based on this study,  xxxd1722xxx  was approved by the us
fda in december 2004 for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory all after at least two prior
chemotherapy regimens.
recently gidwani et al. [41] have published the results of
the first report of successful remission induction in multiple
relapsed all in a 9-year-old boy after combined treatment
with  xxxd1722xxx  and arabinoside cytosine ( xxxd1790xxx ).
 xxxd1722xxx  clinical trials in adult patients
in a phase ii study, 62 patients with relapsed or refractory
aml, all, cml-bp, and mds received  xxxd1722xxx  at a
dose of 40 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 hour infusion daily for 5 days,
every 3 to 6 weeks [36]. in all patients, the or rate was
48%, consisting of 20 cr, 9 crp, and 1 pr, however, it differed by diagnosis, salvage status, and duration of first remission. the or rate was 55% in aml, 50% in mds, 64%
in cml-bp, and 17% in all patients. the most frequently
observed adverse events included hepatotoxicity, skin rashes
and mucositis.
a single institution phase ii trial was conducted with
 xxxd1722xxx  as first line treatment in 28 elderly patients (> 70
years) with aml who were not suitable for conventional
chemotherapy.  xxxd1722xxx  was given at a dose of 30mg/m2

burnett ak, baccarani m, johnson p, yin j, saunders a, russell n, hills r. effectiveness of  xxxd1722xxx  in elderly aml patients with adverse cytogenetics unfit for
intensive chemotherapy. blood, 2006, 108, abstract 1985.

recently, the results of combined therapy of  xxxd1722xxx 
with other antileukemic drugs have also been published [4246]. the combined phase i and ii study was performed in 32
patients with relapsed acute leukaemia consisting of 25
aml, 2 all, 1 cml-bp, and 4 high-risk mds patients
[42]. in phase i trial, the optimal dose of  xxxd1722xxx  was
established when combined with  xxxd1790xxx . the optimal increase
of ara-ctp levels was demonstrated when  xxxd1722xxx  was
dosed 4 hours prior to  xxxd1790xxx  exposure [43]. in a phase ii
trial,  xxxd1722xxx  was given at a dose of 40mg/m2 i.v. daily on
days 2-6 followed 4 hours later by  xxxd1790xxx  at a dose of 1g/m2
i.v. over 2-3 hours daily for on days 1-5. the or rate was
40% in aml patients (28% cr, 12% crp) and 50% in patients with mds. no response was observed in all or
cml-bp patients [42].

810 mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2009, vol. 9, no. 7

another phase ii study, with combination of  xxxd1722xxx 
and  xxxd1790xxx , was performed in patients aged 50 years and older
with previously untreated aml [44].  xxxd1722xxx  was given
at a dose of 40mg/m2 as a 1-hour iv infusion for 5 days (days
2 to 6) followed 4 hours later by  xxxd1790xxx  at a dose of 1g/m2 as
a 2-hour i.v. infusion for 5 days (days 1 to 5). of note, 48%
had secondary aml, 50% had abnormal karyotypes, and
21% showed  xxxg801xxx  abnormalities. the or rate was 60%
including 52% cr and 8% crp. toxicity observed in this
trial was acceptable.
in a randomized study  xxxd1722xxx  versus  xxxd1722xxx  plus
low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  as front line therapy was assessed in patients
aged 60 years and older with aml and high-risk mds [45].
patients received 30mg/m2  xxxd1722xxx  i.v. daily for 5 days
with or without 20mg/m2  xxxd1790xxx  subcutaneously (s.c.) daily
for 14 days as induction. consolidation regimen consisted of
3 days of  xxxd1722xxx  with or without 7 days of  xxxd1790xxx .
for the both treatment groups the or rate was 59% and
56% of patients achieved cr. however the or and cr rates
were significantly higher in patients treated with the combined regimen than compared to those receiving  xxxd1722xxx 
alone (67% vs 31%, p=0.012, and 63% vs 31%, p=0.025,
respectively). the toxicity was comparable in both groups of
patients.
 xxxd1722xxx  was also used in combination with alkylating
agents based on the results of preliminary studies showing
synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibition of dna repair for
combining regimen. eighteen patients with relapsed acute
leukemias were treated with cyclophosphamide (cy) alone
at the dose of 200mg/m2 on day 0, and with  xxxd1722xxx  at the
dose of either 20mg/m2 or 10mg/m2 plus cy on day 1 [46].
pharmacodynamic end points along with clinical results suggest usefulness of this combination strategy, whereas toxicity
data suggest reduction of chemotherapeutic intensity.

lech-maranda et al.

central nervous system. myelosuppression associated with
febrile neutropenia is observed in more then 81% of patients
treated with  xxxd1722xxx  [36, 37]. other side effects recorded
after  xxxd1722xxx  administration include transient headache,
infusion-related irritability, acral erythema, infusion-related
facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and myalgia [12, 36, 37].
conclusions
 xxxd1722xxx  is the most promising  xxxd2705xxx  analogue in current clinical development. this agent is active in
pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed all as well as
demonstrates efficacy alone or in combination with other
cytotoxic drugs in adults with aml. the toxicity of  xxxd1722xxx  is acceptable. an oral formulation of  xxxd1722xxx  is
also being developed.

 xxxd1722xxx  clinical trials in lymphoproliferative disorders and solid tumors
clinical trials with  xxxd1722xxx  in patients with lpds and
solid tumors are limited [5]. in the phase i trial in patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and nonhodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl), a significantly myelosuppression was observed which led to the decreasing of  xxxd1722xxx 
dose to 2mg/m2 i.v. daily for 5 days. the evidence of its activity, including decrease in lymphadenopathy and peripheral
lymphocytosis, was seen in these patients even at low doses
of  xxxd1722xxx , however, no objective response was observed
[37]. the role of  xxxd1722xxx  and its optimal dose schedule in
lpds and solid tumors patients needs to be defined [5]. a
recent study was performed in 8 patients with refractory multiple myeloma (mm).  xxxd1722xxx  was given at a dose of
4mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle [47]. no objective evidence of antineoplastic activity of such regimen was
observed. all patients experienced grade 3-4 neutropenia and
a greater than 50% decrease in platelets counts during treatment. phase i/ii trials with  xxxd1722xxx  in adult patients are
listed in table 1.
