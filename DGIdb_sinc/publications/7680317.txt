the myotonic activity of mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles induced by either a combination of k + channel
blockers ( xxxd1804xxx ) and a ci- channel blocker ( xxxd188xxx ) or a ci- channel blocker in low ca 2÷ (0.25
mm) krebs or a na + channel activator (veratridine) was characterized in this paper. myotonic activity was characterized by an
increase in both the contraction amplitude and contraction duration accompanied by stimulus-related repeated action potentials.
the slow soleus and fast extensor digitorum longus muscles appeared to differ in their responses to these ion channel modifiers.
nevertheless, ehlorpromazine at a low concentration of 1/~m significantly inhibited all kinds of myotonic activity; it reduced the
prolonged contraction duration and attenuated the stimulus-related repeated action potential firing. this depressant action of
chlorpromazine was apparently not correlated with inhibition of either calmodulin or phospholipase a 2 activity, since the
myotonic depressant action of calmodulin inhibitors, such as  xxxd1869xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx , chlorpromazine,  xxxd3431xxx  and
diltiazem, was unrelated to their potency in inhibiting the activity of calmodulin or phospholipase a 2. however, phosphatidylcholine was found to inhibit the myotonic depressant action of chlorpromazine. it is therefore, tentatively concluded that
chlorpromazine interacted with membrane phospholipids, thereby changing membrane ion channel activity and depressing
myotonic activity. these findings indicate that chlorpromazine might be useful in the management of clinical myotonia.

1. introduction
myotonia is a phenomenon characterized by the
generation of repeated action potentials in the sarcolemma in response to a brief stimulus (landau,
1952). it has been reported that a reduction in membrane c1- conductance is capable of inducing myotonia in skeletal muscles (barchi, 1975; palade and
barchi, 1977a, b). we have demonstrated that k ÷
channel blockers ( xxxd1804xxx , uranyl nitrate) in
combination with ci- channel blockers (9-anthracene
carboxylic acid, cd a÷) induce myotonia in mouse diaphragm, characterized by an increased amplitude and
duration of muscle contractions accompanied by stimulus-related repeated firing of action potentials (fu et
al., 1989; lin-shiau et al., 1991). since the muscle
fibres of the diaphragm contain mostly fast-contracting
fibres with only about 20% slow-contracting fibres
(close, 1972), it is worthwhile to study if k ÷ and ci-

channel blockers in combination can induce myotonia
in the slow soleus and fast extensor digitorum longus
skeletal muscles. any defect in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction by membrane ion channels is
considered to be important in the clinical manifestation of myotonia. thus, membrane-stabilizing agents or
modulators of membrane ion channels may be useful in
the management of myotonic symptoms. we attempted
in this paper to study the effects of chlorpromazine on
myotonic activity in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscle, since chlorpromazine has recently
been shown to be a modulator of membrane ion channels (changeux and revah, 1987; mccann and welsh,
1987; ogata et al., 1989). in addition to these actions,
chlorpromazine has long been known to be an inhibitor
of calmodulin (roufogalis, 1985; veigl et al., 1989),
phospholipase a 2 (blackwell and flower, 1983),
dopamine receptors (creese et al., 1975) and leukotriene release (dell'osa and temple, 1986). the resuits obtained indicate that at a therapeutic dose chlorpromazine significantly depressed myotonic activity in
mouse skeletal muscle, suggesting a possible application of chlorpromazine in the management of clinical
myotonic symptoms.

2. materials and methods

2.1. mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus preparations
soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles were
obtained from mice of the icr strain weighing about
20-25 g. the soleus and extensor digitorum longus
muscles were isolated from mice anesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). modified krebs solution of the following composition was used (mm):
naci 130.6, kc1 4.8, caci 2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco 3
12.5 and glucose 11.1. the ph of this solution was 7.4.
the preparations were suspended in the krebs solution in a 10-ml organ bath which was constantly gassed
with 95% 0 2 + 5% co 2 at 37.0 + 0.5°c. the muscle
was stimulated with rectangular pulses of 0.5 ms width
at 0.2 hz to evoke single twitch responses or with a 1-s
train of pulses at 50 hz to evoke tetanic contractions in
the presence of 14 /~m d- xxxd3456xxx . contractions
were recorded isometrically with a force-displacement
transducer (grass ft.03) on a grass model 7d polygraph.

(1976). egg lecithin was emulsified with equimolar na
 xxxd1835xxx  in the presence or absence of 0.05 mm
edta and 10 mm caclz. the hydrolytic activity of
cobra venom was determined by measuring the amount
of 2 mm naoh required to titrate the fatty acid
liberated from egg lecithin. the reaction was performed at 37°c, and the titration end point was set at
ph 7.4.

2.4. statistics
means + s.e. are given. the significance of differences was assessed by using student's t-test. when
more than one group was compared with one control,
significance was evaluated according to anova. p
values < 0.05 were regarded as significant.

2.5. materials
the following compounds were used: chlorpromazine, diltiazem,  xxxd2125xxx ,  xxxd1869xxx , veratridine, 4aminopyridine (all from sigma, st. louis, mo, usa),
 xxxd188xxx  (aldrich, milwaukee, wi,
usa).

2.2. intracellular microelectrode recording
conventional microelectrode recording techniques
(fatt and katz, 1951) were used. glass microelectrodes
filled with 3 m kci and having a resistance in the
range of 5-20 mo were used. the mouse muscle
preparation was placed in modified krebs solution at
37.0 + 0.5°c and gassed with 95% 0 2 + 5% co 2. an
axoclamp-2 preamplifier and hitachi v-352 oscilloscope were used for recording. a data 6000 waveform
analyser (data precision) was used to store and analyse
waveforms. muscle fibre action potentials were elicited
intracellularly by injecting a depolarizing current (1015 na, 50 ms) delivered through the bridge mode of
axoclamp-2. the fibre input resistance was determined
by using the discontinuous current clamp mode of
axoclamp-2. the voltage recorded at the tip of microelectrode was stored by a sample-and hold circuit between each current-passing period after all transient
voltages due to the passing current had decayed. thus
the membrane potential could be recorded independently of ir voltage drops across the electrode. the
fibre input resistance was thus obtained by dividing the
membrane potential drop by the magnitude of the
hyperpolarizing current.

2.3. measurement of phospholipase a 2 activity of cobra
venom
purified egg lecithin was used as the substrate and
the hydrolytic activity of cobra (naja naja atra) venom
was measured by the method described by strong et al.

by k + and c l - channel blockers and the depressant

as shown on fig. 1a and c, 0.1 mm  xxxd1804xxx 
slightly increased the contraction amplitude but did not
prolong the contraction duration. subsequent application of 0.03 mm  xxxd188xxx  which
alone did not significantly potentiate the muscle contractions, markedly prolonged the contraction duration
of the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles
and increased the amplitude of the contractions of

latter but not of the former muscle (fig. 1 and table 1).
in 0.25 mm ca 2÷ krebs solution, 0.03 mm  xxxd188xxx  not only induced spontaneous
contractions but also increased both the amplitude and
duration of soleus muscle contractions (fig. 2), but
failed to induce spontaneous contractions of the extensor digitorum longus muscle.
pretreatment with 1 /zm chlorpromazine markedly
reduced the prolongation of contraction duration of
soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles induced
by  xxxd1804xxx  plus  xxxd188xxx ,
while the increased amplitude of extensor digitorum
longus muscle contractions remained unaltered unless
a higher concentration (10/~m) of chlorpromazine was
applied (fig. 1b and d, table 1). tetrodotoxin at a low
concentration of 0.03 /zm was as potent as 1 /xm
chlorpromazine in depressing myotonic activity in extensor digitorum longus muscle and was more potent in

fig. 3. effects of chlorpromazine on the prolongation of contraction
duration induced by veratridine and  xxxd188xxx  in
mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles, note that
chlorpromazine at concentrations higher than 0.5/zm inhibited the
prolongation of contraction duration of soleus muscle (zx) induced
by  xxxd188xxx  in low ca 2+ medium. chlorpromazine at a lower concentration (0.2 /zm) significantly inhibited the
prolongation of contraction duration induced by veratridine (1.5/~m)
in both soleus ( o ) and extensor digitorum longus (e) muscles in
normal krebs.

inhibiting the prolongation of contraction duration in
the soleus muscle than in the extensor digitorum longus
muscle (table 1).
although  xxxd188xxx  had little effect on the muscle contractions elicited in the normal
ca z+ (2.5 mm) krebs solution, it induced marked
spontaneous contractions of soleus muscle in low (0.25
ram) ca 2+ medium (fig. 2a). chlorpromazine not only
markedly reduced spontaneous contractions (fig. 2b),
but also inhibited the prolongation of contraction duration induced by  xxxd188xxx  in low
c a 2+ medium in a concentration dependent manner
over the concentration range 0.5 to 10 /~m. the ics0
value was 3.8/zm (fig. 3).
we also found that chlorpromazine (3/xm) significantly reduced the prolongation of tetanic contraction
duration induced by  xxxd188xxx  in

3.1.2. characterization of the myotonic activity induced
by a na + channel activator and the depressant action of
drugs
veratridine (1.5 tzm) potentiated the amplitude and
duration of contractions of both soleus and extensor
digitorum longus muscles (table 2). the myotonic activity induced in these muscles by veratridine was also
inhibited by chlorpromazine and tetrodotoxin (table 2);
it appeared that the prolonged contraction duration
was inhibited more than the increased contraction amplitude by 1/~m chlorpromazine. chlorpromazine at a
low concentration (0.2 /~m) significantly reduced the
prolongation of contraction duration induced by veratridine but not that induced by 9-anthracene carboxylic
acid (fig. 3). however, increasing the concentration of
chlorpromazine to 10/zm resulted in a greater inhibition of responses elicited by 9-anthracene carboxylic
acid than responses elicited by veratridine (fig. 3).
thus, chlorpromazine had a differential action on the
myotonic activity induced by veratridine and  xxxd188xxx .
3.2. effects of chlorpromazine on action potential, membrane potential and membrane input resistance of soleus
and extensor digitorum longus muscles
both  xxxd1804xxx  plus 9-anthracene carboxylic
acid and veratridine were able to trigger repeated
action potential firing in soleus muscle upon a single
electrical stimulation (figs. 4c and 5c). this stimulusrelated repeated discharge was also demonstrated in
extensor digitorum longus muscle (data not shown).

membrane potential but significantly increased the
membrane input resistance of the soleus and extensor
digitorum longus muscles both in the presence and
absence of 1/zm chlorpromazine (table 3). however, a
high concentration of chlorpromazine (10/xm) significantly attenuated the increased membrane input resistance of extensor digitorum longus muscle but not that
of soleus muscle. veratridine was found to decrease
the membrane potential as well as membrane input
resistance, effects which were significantly inhibited by
chlorpromazine (table 3).

and diltiazem depressed the drug-induced myotonia of
the soleus muscle in this order of gradually declining
potency. this inhibitory potency was not correlated
with the potency of these agents to inhibit calmodulin
activation of phosphodiesterase (table 4), or with their
order of potency to inhibit the phospholipase a 2 activity of formosan cobra venom (naja naja atra).

4. discussion

in this study, we characterized the potentiation of
contractions induced by either a k ÷ channel blocker
( xxxd1804xxx ) combined with a c1- channel blocker
( xxxd188xxx ) or  xxxd188xxx  alone in 0.25 mm ca 2÷ krebs. comparison of the contraction potentiation induced in the slow
soleus muscle and the fast extensor digitorum longus
muscle revealed some differences (see table 5). these
differences were apparently correlated with the finding
that the resting membrane potential of soleus muscle
was significantly lower, by about 3 mv, than in extensor digitorum longus.  xxxd1804xxx  plus  xxxd188xxx  induced a smaller increase in
membrane input resistance in soleus muscle than in
extensor digitorum longus. the inhibition by tetrodotoxin of potentiation of muscle contractions induced by  xxxd1804xxx  plus 9-anthracene carboxylic
acid or veratridine in soleus muscle was significantly
greater than that in extensor digitorum longus. the
spontaneous repeated action potential firing in most
fibres (66.7%, n = 40/60) of soleus muscle produced
by  xxxd188xxx  in 0.25 mm ca 2÷ krebs
was correlated with the induction of spontaneous contractions, while fewer fibres (32.5%, n = 27/83) produced spontaneous repeated action potential firing in
extensor digitorum longus and no spontaneous contractions occurred. these results suggest that in muscle,
the membrane c1- channels which regulate the resting
membrane potential are more active and na + channels
are more sensitive to the tetrodotoxin in soleus muscle
than those in extensor digitorum longus muscle. these
findings further point out that the differences in slow
and fast skeletal muscles are not only the well-known
biochemical parameters (higher ca z÷ transport system
in sarcoplasmic reticulum and lower content of myoglobin in fast muscle, kauffman and albuquerque,
1970; mommaerts et al., 1977), but also the membrane

ion properties revealed by many studies (toshikazu
and sato, 1967; duval and leoty, 1978; d'alonzo et
al., 1979; mcardle et al., 1980) and in this study
regarding ci- and na ÷ channels. comparison with our
previous findings in the mouse diaphragm, which contains fast- and slow-contracting muscle fibres, show
that the responses of diaphragm to  xxxd188xxx  were intermediate between those of the
fast extensor digitorum longus muscle and the slow
soleus muscle (table 5).
chlorpromazine is a useful therapeutic agent for
schizophrenia (baldessarini, 1990). it not only antagonizes central dopamine receptors (creese et al., 1975)
but also blocks the channel activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (changeux and revah, 1987). it has
been reported that chlorpromazine can inhibit ca 2÷activated k ÷ channels in airway smooth muscle (mccann and welsh, 1987) as well as voltage-gated ion
channels (na ÷, ca 2+ and k ÷) in neuroblastoma cells
(ogata et al., 1989). whether these diverse effects of
chlorpromazine can be attributed to its inhibitory action on calmodulin (weiss et al., 1982) or on membrane phospholipase a 2 (kunze et al., 1976; blackwell
and flower, 1983) still awaits clarification. the inhibition by chlorpromazine of leukotriene release (dell'osa
and temple, 1986) and the protection of myocardial
cells from injury induced by excessive intracellular ca 2÷
(rabkin, 1987) may partly be due to inhibition of
calmodulin as well as phospholipase a 2. in this study,
we demonstrated that at a therapeutic concentration of
1 /xm chlorpromazine significantly inhibited the contraction potentiation and the repeated action potentials induced by  xxxd1804xxx  plus 9-anthracene
carboxylic acid or  xxxd188xxx  alone in
low ca 2+ krebs or veratridine (an alkaloid isolated
from veratrum album with na + channel opening activity; shanes, 1958; hills, 1984). this myotonic-like action, described by barchi (1975) and adrian and marshall (1976), was attenuated by chlorpromazine with
little inhibition of normal twitches evoked by electrical

stimulation. thus chlorpromazine may be a useful agent
for the therapy of clinical myotonia without causing
inhibition of generalized muscle activity.
in order to elucidate the possible mechanism of this
depressant action of chlorpromazine, we studied five
compounds ( xxxd1869xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx , chlorpromazine,
 xxxd3431xxx  and diltiazem) for their myotonia-depressant action and  xxxg1759xxx -inhibitory activity. the results obtained (table 4) showed that the
myotonia-depressant actions of these five compounds
did not correlate with their inhibitory actions on phospholipase a 2 or calmodulin, as described by veigl et
al. (1989). moreover, we found that chlorpromazine at
1/zm had no effect on the changes in membrane input
resistance induced by  xxxd1804xxx  plus  xxxd188xxx , whereas it significantly inhibited
the decrease in membrane input resistance induced by
veratridine in soleus and extensor digitorum longus
muscles. both chlorpromazine and tetrodotoxin inhibited the myotonic effects of  xxxd1804xxx  plus 9anthracene carboxylic acid and veratridine. these findings suggest that chlorpromazine exerts its myotoniadepressant action, at least in part, by modifying na +
channels.
as chlorpromazine could be used in the clinical
management of myotonia, we tried to induce myotonia
in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles
with tetanic pulses in the presence of 9-anthracene
carboxylic acid in low ca 2+ medium. the results
showed that chlorpromazine indeed exerted an inhibitory effect on drug-induced myotonia. moreover, in
the in vivo study, myotonia induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of  xxxd188xxx 
was effectively reversed by chlorpromazine (data not
shown).
in conclusion, we induced myotonic activity in the
slow soleus and fast extensor digitorum longus muscles
with either a combination of blockers of k + and c1channels, a ci- channel blocker alone in low ca 2+
medium or a na + channel activator. chlorpromazine

at a therapeutic concentration was able to attenuate
the myotonic activity, possibly by modulating ion channels rather than by inhibiting phospholipase a 2 or
calmodulin.
