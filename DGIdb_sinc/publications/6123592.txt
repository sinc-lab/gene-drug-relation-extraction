receptor interactions of imidazolines. ix.  xxxd1707xxx  is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist and an alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist.  the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic effects of  xxxd1707xxx  were evaluated in guinea-pig aorta and field-stimulated guinea-pig ileum, respectively.  xxxd1707xxx  was found to be a full agonist  xxxd2216xxx -1 receptors having an ed50, dissociation constant (ka) and relative efficacy similar to that of (-)-norepinephrine. in contrast,  xxxd1707xxx  does not possess agonist activity at presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the guinea-pig ileum. thus, whereas norepinephrine and  xxxd1707xxx  both inhibited the twitch response of the field-stimulated ileum, only the response to norepinephrine was blocked by the selective alpha-2 antagonist, yohimbine. the nonadrenergic inhibition of the twitch response observed in the ileum with  xxxd1707xxx  resulted from weak anticholinergic activity (antimuscarinic) at the level of the postsynaptic effector organ and was observed only at high concentrations. at concentrations far below the level required to inhibit the twitch response,  xxxd1707xxx  was found to competitively antagonize the alpha-2-mediated inhibition of the twitch response elicited by norepinephrine. a schild plot analysis indicated that  xxxd1707xxx  is a potent competitive alpha-2 receptor antagonist characterized by a pa2 value (i.e., -log kb) of 7.56. these results indicate that  xxxd1707xxx  is unique among imidazolines in that it is a potent alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist and an even more potent alpha-2 receptor antagonist. this unusual combination of activities could make  xxxd1707xxx  a particularly effective vasoconstricting agent.
