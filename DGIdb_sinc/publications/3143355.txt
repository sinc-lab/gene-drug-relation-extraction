high-molecular-mass proteins from pea (pisum sativum) mitochondrial matrix retained on an xm-300
diaflo membrane ('matrix extract') exhibited high rates of glycine oxidation in the presence of nad+ and
tetrahydropteroyl- xxxd2431xxx  (h4folate) as long as the medium exhibited a low ionic strength. serine
hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) (4 x 53 kda) and the four proteins of the glycine-cleavage system,
including a  xxxd3047xxx -containing enzyme ('p-protein'; 2  xxxd1800xxx  kda), a carrier protein containing
covalently bound  xxxd2494xxx  ('h-protein'; 15.5 kda), a protein exhibiting  xxxg641xxx  activity
('l-protein'; 2 x 61 kda) and an h4folate-dependent enzyme ('t-protein'; 45 kda) have been purified to
apparent homogeneity from the matrix extract by using gel filtration, ion-exchange and phenyl-superose fast
protein liquid chromatography. gel filtration on sephacryl s-300 in the presence of 50 mm-kcl proved to
be the key step in disrupting this complex. during the course of glycine oxidation catalysed by the matrix
extract a steady-state equilibrium in the production and utilization of 5, 10-methylene-h4folate was reached,
suggesting that glycine cleavage and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  are linked together via a soluble pool of h4folate. the rate of
glycine oxidation catalysed by the matrix extract was sensitive to the nadh/nad+ molar ratios, because
nadh competitively inhibited the reaction catalysed by  xxxg641xxx .
introduction
during photorespiration in the leaves of higher plants
having the 'c3' pathway of photosynthesis, glycine is
rapidly oxidatively decarboxylated in the mitochondria
to yield co2, nh3, serine and nadh (lorimer &
andrews, 1981; tolbert, 1980). the available evidence
suggests that, in green-leaf cells, the complete process
occurs within the mitochondrial matrix via a co-ordinated
sequence of reactions (keys, 1980). glycine is cleaved in
the matrix space (douce, 1985) by the glycine-cleavage
system ( xxxg156xxx ,  xxxg156xxx ) to c02,
nh3 and 5,10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl-lglutamic acid (5,10-ch2h4folate). the latter compound
produced reacts with a second molecule of glycine to
form serine in a reaction catalysed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ;  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) (schirch, 1982;
rao & rao, 1982). the glycine-cleavage system has been
purified from plants (walker & oliver, 1986a), animals
(kikuchi & hiraga, 1982) and bacteria (klein & sagers,
1966, 1967; kochi & kikuchi, 1974) and consists of four
protein components (klein & sagers, 1967; kikuchi &
hiraga, 1982), which have been tentatively named
'p-protein' (a  xxxd3047xxx -containing protein),
h-protein (a  xxxg879xxx , t-protein (a
protein catalysing the tetrahydrofolate-dependent step of
the reaction) and l-protein (a  xxxg641xxx ).

the  xxxg896xxx  is present in low amounts in
etiolated pea leaves, but increases dramatically upon
light exposure (day et al., 1985; walker & oliver,
1986b). in addition this enzyme has been successfully
solubilized from pea leaf mitochondria as an acetonedried powder (sarojini & oliver, 1983; walker & oliver,
1986a).  xxxg896xxx  thus prepared could
catalyse the reverse of the  xxxg896xxx  reaction
by converting serine, nh4 + and co2 into glycine.
however, no attempt has been made to monitor the
forward reaction, that is, the conversion of glycine into
serine and nadh in the presence of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . the studies
of walker & oliver (1986a) indicated that precipitation
of the enzyme from pea leaf mitochondria by cold
acetone produced a crude extract exhibiting glycinebicarbonate exchange. under these conditions, the p-,
h- and t-proteins can be separated by (nh4)2so4 and
poly(ethylene glycol) precipitations, gel filtration and
ion-exchange chromatography (walker & oliver, 1986a).
however, the isolation of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  was not carried out,
and the l-protein was not purified but was studied
immunochemically. the results of walker & oliver
(1986a) therefore suggest that, after acetone extraction,
the  xxxg896xxx  multienzyme complex exists in
solution predominantly as four separate enzymes.
fairly recently a fully active glycine-cleavage system
associated with  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  has been isolated from the matrix

of pea leaf mitochondria (neuburger et al., 1986). the
physiological integrity of this complex was maintained if
the preparation of the enzymic extract was carried out at
low ion concentrations and at about neutral ph in order
to prevent the release of the h-protein from the glycine
decarboxylase (kikuchi & hiraga, 1982). with the aim
of further clarifying the mechanisms of glycine oxidation
in green leaf mitochondria, the present paper details the
rapid isolation of all the protein components involved in
glycine oxidation coupled to serine production. in
addition, we here report some regulatory properties of
this multienzyme complex.
material and methods
isolation of mitochondria
mitochondria were isolated and purified from pea
leaves as described by douce et al. (1987), using selfgenerating percoll gradients and a linear gradient of
0-10 % (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone 25 (top to bottom).
the mitochondria were found in a tight white band near
the bottom of the tube, whereas the thylakoids remained
near the top of the tube. the mitochondria were
subsequently concentrated by differential centrifugation.
the purified mitochondria were suspended in a medium
(suspending medium) containing 0.3 m-mannitol, 10 mmphosphate buffer, ph 7.2, 1 mm-edta and 1 mm-/fmercaptoethanol at approx. 50-100 mg of protein/ml.
02 uptake was measured at 25 °c with a clark-type
oxygen electrode purchased from hansatech (king's
lynn, norfolk, u.k.). the reaction medium contained
0.3 m-mannitol, 5 mm-mgcl2, 10 mm-kcl, 10 mmphosphate buffer (ph 7.2), 0.1 0% (w/v) defatted bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and known quantities of mitochondrial
protein in a total volume of i ml. with 10 mm-glycine as
substrate, the respiratory-control index was routinely'
better than 4 and the state-3 rate of 02 uptake was
higher than 100 nmol/min per mg of protein (douce
et al., 1987). the mitochondria were better than 9500
intact as judged by their impermeability to  xxxg569xxx 
(douce et al., 1972).
solubilization of the glycine-cleavage system and
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  from pea leaf mitochondria
pea leaf mitochondria (about 100 mg of protein) were
diluted in 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 5 mm-mops,
5 mm-tris, 1 mm-/j- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm-egta,
20 ,sm- xxxd3047xxx , 1 mm-serine, 1 mm-octyl
,-d-glucopyranoside (calbiochem), ph 7.0. the addition
of 4,um-leupeptin to the lysis buffer provides further
protection of the enzymes against endogenous proteinases. total release of the matrix protein was achieved
by three cycles of freezing and thawing (neuburger et al.,
1986). the mitochondrial suspension was frozen by
placing it at liquid-n2 temperature for 2 min. the frozen
mitochondrial suspension was then maintained at 30 °c
until thawed. this procedure breaks about 980 of the
mitochondria. the suspension of broken mitochondria
was centrifuged at 100000 g for 2 h (36000 rev./min in a
beckman sw-40 rotor) to remove all the mitochondrial
membranes. the high-molecular-mass complexes (above
300 kda) from the matrix fraction were obtained by
filtration of the supernatant on a diaflo membrane xm300 using a stirred cell on a magnetic-stirring table
(amicon). the flow rate was i ml/min. all the proteins
involved in the conversion of glycine into serine were

retained by this selectively retentive membrane (matrix
extract, final volume 2 ml) as long as the ph is maintained
at about neutrality and the medium exhibits a low ionic
strength. under these conditions we have verified that
the small protein component of the glycine-cleavage
system ('h-protein'; 15.5 kda), as well as  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , did
not pass through the diaflo membrane. at this stage, the
glycine-cleavage/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  system could be stored at
-80 °c under n2 without deterioration for many
months. however, after several cycles of freezing and
thawing the glycine-cleavage complex lost part of its
activity, owing to p-protein denaturation.
assay of glycine oxidation in matrix extract
glycine oxidation was assayed at 25 °c by measuring
the formation of nadh or serine that was dependent
upon the presence of both glycine and h4folate
(l-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl- xxxd2431xxx ) (cossins,
1987). the standard reaction mixture contained, in a
total volume of 400 1ll: 5 mm-mops, 5 mm-tris (ph 7.2),
1 mm-mgcl2, 1 mm-egta, 20 ,tm- xxxd3047xxx ,
1 mm-/j- xxxd26xxx , 2 mm-nad', 5 jug of antimycin a, 0.35 mm-h4folate [h4folate had been prepared chemically by the catalytic hydrogenation of
l- xxxd2146xxx  according to the method of
huennekens et al. (1963)] and known quantities of
matrix extract or proteins isolated from the matrix
extract. the medium and all the stock solutions were
bubbled with argon [in the presence of atmospheric 02
there was a rapid oxidation of h4folate to h2folate
(l-7,8-dihydropteroyl- xxxd2431xxx ), which has an
absorption maximum at 282 nm]. when h4folate is
freshly dissolved, the absorption maximum is at 298 nm,
but within 10 min, in the presence of 02, the spectrum
shifts to 282 nm (hatefi et al., 1959). the reaction,
carried out under strict anaerobic conditions, was
initiated by addition of 20 mm-glycine, unless otherwise
stated. the rate of nadh formation was measured
at 340 nm using a kontron (uvikon 810) spectrophotometer. at various times, 50 gul aliquots were taken
and added to 50/11 of cold 1 m-hci. the samples were
centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 g (beckman microfuge b)
to remove proteins. the supernatant was used for serine
determination. serine was analysed in sodium citrate
buffers with an amino acid analyser (model 11 8c;
beckman instruments, palo alto, ca, u.s.a.).
assay of serine hydroxymethyltransferase
the rate of the reaction was monitored by trapping the
formaldehyde product isolated from 5,10-ch2-h4folate
as the dimedon complex and extracting it into a layer of
toluene (schirch, 1984).
the assay mixture contained 20 mm-potassium
phosphate, ph 7.4, 1 mm-,8- xxxd26xxx , 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm-edta, 4 mm-l-[3-'4c]serine (2.4 x
104 bq/nmol) and enzyme in a total volume of 0.2 ml.
all components were first incubated for 5 min at 370
under argon. the reaction was then initiated by the
addition of 2 mm-h4folate and was terminated with
0.4 m-sodium acetate (ph 4.5), 20 mm-formaldehyde and
0.1 m-dimedon (added in succession). the mixture was
heated for 5 min at 100 °c to accelerate the formation of
the [14c]formaldehyde-dimedon derivative. the tubes
were then cooled for 5 min in an ice bath before the
,dimedon derivative was extracted by vigorous shaking

glycine-cleavage reaction in green-leaf mitochondria

with 3 ml of toluene (taylor & weissbach, 1965). after
centrifugation at 2000 rev./min for 10 min (kontron
ss34 rotor), 2 ml of upper phase were removed for
radioactivity counting in an intertechnique sl 4000
liquid-scintillation spectrometer.
assay of p-, h- and t-proteins
the activities of p- and h-proteins were determined by
measuring the amounts of ["4c]bicarbonate fixed to the
carboxy-group carbon atom of glycine during the
exchange reaction (hiraga & kikuchi, 1980). the assay
mixture, in a final volume of 200 ,ll, contained 25 mmpotassium phosphate, ph 7.0, 1 mm-dithiothreitol,
20 ,tm- xxxd3047xxx , 25 mm-glycine and 40 mm["4c]bicarbonate (500 bq/nmol), 30 ,tg of h-protein for
p-protein assay or 30 ,tg of p-protein for h-protein assay,
and an appropriate amount of the enzyme preparation to
be tested. the reaction was initiated by addition of
bicarbonate. at 5 and 10 min of incubation, a portion
(200 4tl) of the reaction mixture was transferred to a glass
radioactivity-counting vial containing 80 ,ul of acetic
acid and the mixture was dried on a hot plate. the
radioactivity was determined with an intertechnique
sl 4000 spectrometer after addition of 10 ml of aqueous
counting scintillant. a unit of p-protein (in the presence
of saturating amount of h-protein) was defined as the
amount of p-protein that catalysed the fixation of 1 ,umol
of `co2 into glycine/min. likewise 1 unit of h-protein
(in the presence of saturating amount of p-protein) was
also defined as the amount of h-protein that catalysed
the fixation of 1 /smol of "4co2 into glycine/min.
the activity of t-protein was assayed by measuring
the formation of nadh that was dependent upon the
presence of saturating amounts of p-, h- and l-proteins
and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . the assay mixture contained, in a total
volume of 400 ,ll, 5 mm-mops, 5 mm-tris, ph 7.3, 1 mm,/- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm-mgcl2, i mm-edta, 20 /tmpyridoxal phosphate, 0.35 mm-h4folate, 20 ,g of pprotein, 20 #sg of h-protein, 20 ,ug of l-protein and 40 ,tg
of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . the reaction was initiated by the addition of
an appropriate amount of the enzyme preparation (tprotein) to be tested. the rate of nadh formation was
measured under anaerobiosis at 340 nm by using a
kontron (uvikon 810) spectrophotometer. t-protein
activity was expressed as ,tmol of nadh formed/min.
assay of l-protein
the activity of l-protein was assayed by measuring
the formation of nadh that was dependent upon the
presence of  xxxd1887xxx . the standard reaction
mixture contained 5 mm-mops, 5 mm-tris, ph 7, 1 mm1 mm-egta, 2 mm-nad' and
2 mm- xxxd1887xxx  and enzyme (l-protein) in a total
volume of 400 ,tl. the reaction, carried out under strict
anaerobic conditions, was initiated by addition of
 xxxd1887xxx . the rate of nadh formation was
measured at 340 nm by using a kontron (uvikon 810)
spectrophotometer.  xxxd1887xxx  was prepared
from  xxxd2494xxx  (dl- xxxd2494xxx ; sigma) as described
by kochi & kikuchi (1976).
assay of pyruvate dehydrogenase
the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was assayed at
340 nm by using a kontron (uvikon 810) spectrophotometer. the sta-ndard assay mixture contained
50 mm-mops, ph 7.5, 0.2 mm-thiamin pyrophosphate,

enzyme in a total volume of i ml (rapp et al., 1987).
purification of p-, l-, t- and h-proteins and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
from matrix extract
step 1: matrix-extract fractionation. the matrix extract
(2 ml; 80 mg of protein) supplemented with 4/tmleupeptin was applied to a 2.5 cm x 35 cm column of
sephacryl s-300 (superfine grade; pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mm-kcl/5 mm-mops/5 mm-tris(ph 7.5)/
2 mm-,/- xxxd26xxx / 1 mm-egta/ 1 mm-serine/
i mm-glycine (buffer a). the column connected to a
pharmacia f.p.l.c. system was eluted with the same buffer
at 4 °c (flow rate 0.5 ml/min; fraction size 2 ml).
p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were eluted together (heavy
fraction), as were t- and h-protein (light fraction), and
l-protein activity was eluted between light and heavy
fractions (intermediary fraction). the heavy and lprotein fractions were combined separately and concentrated to 1-2 ml by ultrafiltration (xm-50 membrane;
amicon). pooled fractions containing h- and t-protein
activities (light fraction) were dialysed and concentrated
to 1-2 ml by ultrafiltration (pm 10 membrane; amicon)
in s mm-mops/s mm-tris (ph 7.5)/2 mm-,/- xxxd26xxx /i mm-egta (buffer d).

step 2: purification of p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  from heavy
fraction. a portion of the heavy fraction (see step 1)
(19 mg of protein) was applied to a trisacryl m deae
column (industrie biologique francaise; 1 cm x 41 cm)
designated to fit into pharmacia's f.p.l.c. system and
previously equilibrated with buffer a containing 10 mmphosphate buffer, ph 7.5, instead of tris and mops
buffers. p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were eluted at 4 °c with a
continuously increasing kcl gradient (50-1000 mm) in
the same buffer (flow rate 0.5 ml/min; fraction size 2 ml).
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  activity was eluted in the- void volume. by
contrast, p-protein activity emerged as a very large peak
at 100 mm-kcl. fractions containing  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  and pprotein were concentrated by ultrafiltration through a
diaflo membrane xm-100 (amicon). the pooled
fractions of p-protein were then applied to a phenylsuperose hr 5/5 column (pharmacia; 0.5 cm x 5 cm)
previously equilibrated with buffer b containing 10 mmpotassium phosphate, ph 7.5, 1 mm-egta, 1 mm-/imercaptoethanol, 1 mm-glycine and 1 m-(nh4)2so4. the
column, connected to a pharmacia f.p.l.c. system, was
eluted with a decreasing (nh4)2so4 gradient (1-0 m)
(flow rate 0.5 ml min-'; fraction size 1 ml). p-protein
emerged as a peak at 250 mm-(nh4)2so4.
the pooled fractions of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were applied to a mono
q hr 5/5 column (pharmacia; 5 cm x 5 cm) previously
equilibrated with buffer c containing 10 mm-potassium
phosphate, ph 6.8, 1 mm-egta, i mm-/3- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm-serine. the column, connected to a
pharmacia f.p.l.c. system, was eluted with a continuously
increasing potassium phosphate gradient (10-200 mm)
(flow rate 0.3 ml min-'; fraction size 0.9 ml).  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
emerged as a sharp peak at 100 mm-potassium phosphate.
the fractions containing proteins were combined
separately, and each was concentrated to 0.5 ml by use
of ultrafiltration on a xm-100 membrane or by use of a
fast desalting hr 10/10 f.p.l.c.. purified p-protein and
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were stored at -80 °c in buffer b without
(nh4)2so4 or buffer c.

step 3: purification of h- and t-proteins from light
fraction. a portion of the light fraction (see step 1) (6 mg
of protein) was applied to a mono q hr 5/5 column
previously equilibrated in buffer d. h- and t-protein
were eluted at 4 °c and at ph 7.5 with a continuously
increasing potassium phosphate gradient (0-500 mm) in
buffer d (flow rate 0.3 ml min-'; fraction size 0.9 ml).
t-protein, which is positively charged at physiological
ph, was eluted in the void volume; by contrast, hprotein emerged as a sharp peak at 210 mm-potassium
phosphate. purified h- and t-protein fractions concentrated to 0.5 ml by use of ultrafiltration on a ym-10
membrane were stored at -80 °c in buffer d.

(b) native gels. gels consisting of 5 % acrylamide and
0.2 % bisacrylamide in 40 mm-tris/hcl, ph 8.0, were
prepared as described by laemmli (1970), except that
detergent was omitted from the different buffers.
electrophoresis was performed at 15 ma/gel at 4 °c for
6 h.
m, determination
the mr values for the proteins were determined by gel
filtration (andrews, 1965) by using ultrogel aca-34
(gel-filtration range 20000-350000 mr; ibf) equilibrated
in buffer a. protein standards (pharmacia calibration
kit) were ferritin (molecular mass 440 kda), bovine liver
catalase (232 kda), aldolase (158 kda), bovine serum
albumin (67 kda), ovalbumin (43 kda), chymotrypsinogen (25 kda) and  xxxg569xxx  (12.5 kda). the
mr was calculated from a plot of log mr against elution
volume.

-

step 4: purification of l-protein from intermediary
fraction. l-protein activity was eluted between the light
and heavy fractions (see step 1) (12 mg of protein) was
applied to a mono q hr 5/5 column previously
equilibrated in 10 mm-potassium phosphate, ph 7.5.
l-protein was eluted at 4 °c and at ph 7.5 with a
continuously increasing potassium phosphate gradient
(10-500 mm) (flow rate 0.3 ml min-'; fraction size,
0.9 ml). l-protein emerged as a single peak at 270 mmpotassium phosphate.
electrophoresis
(a) lds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. the
electrophoresis was performed at 4 °c in lds/polyacrylamide slab gels containing a 7.5-15 % or 10-15 %
linear acrylamide gradient. the experimental conditions
for gel preparation, sample solubilization, electrophoresis
and gel staining were detailed by chua (1980).

results
protein components of the  xxxg896xxx  system
and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
the isolation method described in the materials and
methods section provides all the protein components of
the  xxxg896xxx  and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  in good yield and
at a high level of purity in 2 working days. gel filtration
on sephacryl s-300 in the presence of 50 mm-kcl and at
ph 7.5 proved to be the key step in disrupting the
'multienzyme complex' obtained by filtration of the
matrix proteins on a diaflo membrane xm300 and
involved in glycine oxidation (neuburger et al., 1986). a

typical elution profile is shown in fig. 1. under these
conditions, all the proteins (p, h, t and l) associated
with the  xxxg896xxx  were clearly resolved.
however, p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , which exhibit the same
mr, were eluted almost together (heavy fraction).
interestingly, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
which is more stable, was eluted in the void volume (fig.
1). when the same experiment was carried out at low
ionic strength and at a ph of about neutrality, a
considerable amount of h-protein was eluted in
association with p-protein (results not shown; see also
kikuchi & hiraga, 1982).
purification of p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . the overall
scheme and results of the purification procedure for pprotein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  are shown in table 1. the procedure
resulted in a 9-fold purification for p-protein and 59-fold
purification for  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . after the subsequent gel-

filtration and ion-exchange-chromatography steps, pprotein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were almost pure, with molecular
masses of 97 + 2 kda and 53+2 kda respectively, as
determined by lds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis
(fig. 2). the molecular masses of p-protein and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
were estimated to be 210 + 7 kda and 220+ 10 kda by
using a calibrated ultrogel aca-34 gel column (andrews,
1965) and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under nondenaturating conditions. this would therefore suggest

shown in table 2. the procedure resulted in a 9.6-fold
purification for h-protein and 8.8-fold for t-protein.
lds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of purified hand t-proteins resulted in single bands corresponding to
15.5 + 1 kda for h-protein and of
a molecular mass of
45+2 kda for t-protein (fig. 2). the molecular mass
of h-protein was estimated to be 15.5 +1 kda by
using polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under nondenaturating conditions. since t-protein is positively
charged (okamura-ikeda et al., 1987), its molecular mass
was estimated to be 45+2 kda by using a calibrated
ultragel aca-34 gel column. these results strongly
suggest that both proteins are composed of a single
polypeptide (walker & oliver, 1986a).

basis of lds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, the lprotein that emerges from the ion-exchange column was
more than 95 % pure and exhibited  xxxg220xxx  molecular

fig. 3. effect of h4folate (h4f) on glycine (gly) oxidation
catalysed by a matrix extract isolated from pea leaf
nitochondria
the preparation of the matrix extract is described in the
text. the standard reaction mixture (see the text) contained
0.28 mg of matrix extract protein. glycine oxidation was
assayed at 25 °c by measuring the formation of nadh at
340 nm with a kontron (uvikon-810) spectrophotometer.
the values along the traces refer to nmol of nadh
formed/min per mg of protein. note that, especially at low
14folate concentrations, the rate of glycine oxidation was
clearly biphasic.

between 6.8 and 7.5. we have verified that the smaller
proteins of this complex [h-protein (15.5 kda) and tprotein (45 kda)] (see fig. 2) did not pass through the
xm300 diaflo membrane, suggesting that, at low ionic
strength and at a ph of about neutrality, all the proteins
of the glycine-cleavage system exist in the form of an
enzyme complex which is easily disrupted (fig. 1).
furthermore the addition of purified h-protein or
t-protein to the enzymic extract in the presence of
saturating amounts of h4folate did not significantly
change the rate of glycine oxidation (table 4). these
results demonstrate, therefore, that t-protein and hprotein, which acts as a co-substrate with glycine during
the decarboxylation catalysed by p-protein (fujiwara &
motokawa, 1983) were present in saturating amounts in
the matrix extract.
we have shown previously that the rate of glycine
oxidation catalysed by the matrix extract was clearly

biphasic (neuburger et al., 1986). at low h4folate
concentrations the change of slope was pronounced,
whereas at high h4f concentrations it was hardly visible
(fig. 3). interestingly, when the nadh concentration
attained at the change of slope was plotted against the
amount of h4folate initially added, a straight line was
obtained (results not shown), suggesting that this
unexpected phenomenon was attributable to partial
exhaustion of h4folate for  xxxg896xxx . in
other words this would suggest that, in this particular
condition, the rate-limiting step of glycine oxidation
after the change of slope may be the regeneration of h4folate from 5,10-ch2-h4folate by  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  for glycine
decarboxylase functioning. in support of this suggestion,
fig. 4, showing the accumulation of nadh and 5,10ch2-h4folate during the course of glycine oxidation,
indicates that 5,1 0-ch2-h4folate accumulated very
rapidly up to the change of slope in the rate of nadh
production. from this point a steady-state equilibrium in
the production and utilization of 5, 10-ch2-h4folate was
reached, and nadh and serine were formed equally
(neuburger et al., 1986), indicating that the glycinecleavage system and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  operate in a concerted
manner. the concentration of 5,10-ch2-h4folate
attained at the equilibrium was dependent upon several
critical factors, including the initial concentration of h,folate (fig. 5) and the respective strengths of glycine
cleavage and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (results not shown). for example,
addition of a large excess of purified  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  to the matrix
extract oxidizing glycine in the presence of a low initial
concentration of h4folate led to a linearity of the nadh
production rate (fig. 4) and to a decline of 5,10-ch2h4folate attained at the equilibrium (fig. 4). all these
results together demonstrate that  xxxg896xxx 
and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  are not linked together and interact via a
soluble pool of h4folate.
the rate of glycine oxidation catalysed by the matrix
extract exhibited saturation with increasing nad+
concentration, with an apparent km of 75 jum (neuburger
et al., 1986). however, the product of the glycine

fig. 4. simultaneous measurement of nadh and 5,10-ch2-h4folate formation during the course of glycine oxidation
catalysed by a matrix extract isolated from pea leaf
mitochondria.
the preparation of the matrix extract is described in the
text. the standard reaction mixture contained 148 ,tm-h4folate, 0.19 mg of matrix extract protein (a) and 0.19 mg of
matrix extract protein +35,tg of purified  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (b).
glycine oxidation was assayed at 25 °c by measuring the
formation of either nadh at 340 nm, using a spectrophotometer, or 5,10-ch2-h4folate, using [2-3h]glycine
(1.1 tbq/mmol; amersham international) and trapping
the formaldehyde product isolated from 5,10-ch2-14folate as the dimedon complex (see the materials and
methods section).

oxidation, namely nadh, competitively inhibited the
reaction when nad+ was the varied substrate at
saturating concentrations of h4folate and glycine
(neuburger et al., 1986). interestingly, the apparent ki
value (15 /tm) for nadh was 5 times lower than the km
for nad'. since the reoxidation of the dihydrolipoyl
moiety of the h-protein catalysed by lipoamide
dehydrogenase utilized nad+ as the ultimate electron
acceptor, we have examined pea leaf lipoamide
dehydrogenase (l-protein) activity as a function of
nad+ and nadh concentrations. fig. 6 indicates that
l-protein had, in contrast with the  xxxg896xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  system (matrix extract), a relatively
high km for nad+. on the other hand, the apparent
ki value for nadh was in the same range as the value
reported for  xxxg896xxx / xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  system.
these results demonstrate, therefore, that the steadystate activity of the complex is sensitive to the nadh/
nad+ molar ratios and strongly suggest that nad+ and
nadh act directly on l-protein via a lipoyl moiety
covalently bound to the h-protein, a constituent element
of the glycine-cleavage system (kikuchi & hiraga, 1982).
in support of this last suggestion, we have shown that
neither the glycine-bicarbonate exchange reaction
catalysed by p- and h-protein nor  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were inhibited
by nadh (results not shown). interestingly, since
isolated  xxxg641xxx  had an apparent km
for nad' (fig. 6) higher than the value reported for the
matrix extract (neuburger et al., 1986), it is very likely
that l-protein once associated with the glycine-cleavage
system does not determine the final rate of glycine
oxidation in the presence of saturating amounts of
nad+. this view is strengthened by the fact that
addition of purified l-protein to the enzymic extract in
the presence of saturating amounts of nad+, glycine

discussion
the experiments described concern the fragile enzyme
system from leaf mitochondria, isolated as described by
neuburger et al. (1986) and capable of very rapidly
oxidizing glycine to nadh and serine. it is obvious that
the physiological integrity of this system is maintained at
low ion concentrations and at a ph of about neutrality.

under these conditions, once released from the matrix
all the enzyme constituents of this 'complex',
including h-protein (molecular mass 15.5 kda) are
retained on an xm-300 diaflo membrane. on the other
hand, all the protein components of the complex become
separable non-associated polypeptides as the concentration of ions and ph of the medium are increased.
furthermore, since the glycine-cleavage system and
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were readily solubilized by freezing and thawing
the mitochondria, the results imply that all the proteins
of the glycine-cleavage system, as well as  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , are not
firmly bound to the inner membrane, in contrast with
previous suggestions (sarojini & oliver, 1983).
two points of interest emerge from these studies with
respect to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. firstlythere is a clear difference in the aggregation state of
protein components of pyruvate dehydrogenase and
glycine-cleavage complexes. it is apparent that, in
contrast with pyruvate dehydrogenase, all the protein
components of the glycine-cleavage system dissociate
very easily and perhaps behave as separate components
in the matrix space. this point requires further investigation. interestingly, walker & oliver (1986a) have
also shown that the  xxxg896xxx  multienzyme
complex from pea leaf mitochondria exists in solution
predominantly as four separate enzymes after acetone
extraction. secondly, molecular-mass similarities
between the purified  xxxg641xxx  of glycine
decarboxylase (molecular mass 120 kda) and pyruvate
dehydrogenase (reed, 1981) raise the question whether a
unique protein is involved in the reoxidation of the
dihydrolipoyl moieties of both lipoamide dehydrogenasecontaining enzyme complexes or whether isoenzymes are
involved. preliminary results carried out by walker &
oliver (1986a) indicate that a monoclonal antibody
against the  xxxg641xxx  of pea leaf glycine
cleavage complex produced indistinguishable inhibition
profiles for both complexes. on the other hand, rat liver
mitochondria contains two immunologically distinct
forms of  xxxg641xxx  (carothers
et al., 1987).
the results presented here strongly suggest that a
soluble pool of h4folate located in the matrix constitutes
a biochemical link between the glycine-cleavage system
and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . it is very likely that the concentration of
5,10-ch2-h4folate attained at the equilibrium (that is,
when its rate of formation by the glycine-cleavagecomplex matches its rate of utilization by  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) is
strongly dependent on the respective strengths of glycine
cleavage and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . in support of this suggestion we
have shown that, when the activity of the glycine
decarboxylase is powerful, 5,10-ch2-h4folate is
maintained at a high level. conversely, a large excess of
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  decreased the level of 5, 10-ch2 h4folate attained
at the equilibrium. it was previously shown that glycine
decarboxylase represents a large proportion of the
matrix protein in green leaf mitochondria (day et al.,
1985; walker & oliver, 1986a). furthermore, we have
shown that, after centrifugation on percoll gradients,
space

mitochondria from etiolated leaves were located in
a band higher in the tube than those from mature
leaves containing the glycine-cleavage/ xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  system,
suggesting the mitochondria from etiolated leaves are
lighter (day et al., 1985). if the large amount of glycine
decarboxylase present in the matrix space is associated
with a large pool of soluble h4folate, we can speculate

1988

glycine-cleavage reaction in green-leaf mitochondria

that in vivo during the course of glycine oxidation a large
pool of 5,10-ch2-h4folate is maintained in the matrix
space owing to  xxxg896xxx  activity continuously pushing  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  towards serine production
( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  catalysed a freely reversible reaction). such a
situation triggers a rapid rate of 02 consumption. this is
in contrast with the situation observed in mammalian
mitochondria, where glycine added to intact mitochondria is unable to trigger 02 consumption because
 xxxg896xxx  represents a minute fraction of
the total matrix protein. in support of this suggestion,
preliminary experiments carried out in this laboratory
indicate that, during the greening process, the concentration of h4folate in isolated purified mitochondria
increased steadily. to date, long-chain polyglutamates
(coffin & cossins, 1986; cossins, 1987) have not been
examined as substrates for  xxxg896xxx  and
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , and the substrate specificity of these enzymes
warrants further studies.
the data reported here also demonstrate that glycinecleavage activity in vivo in green leaf mitochondria is
regulated by the nadh/nad+ molar ratio and that
nad+ and nadh act directly on l-protein via the
lipoyl moiety covalently bound to the h-protein. the
activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase
and a-oxo glutarate dehydrogenase complexes containing
 xxxg641xxx  are also regulated by nadh,
which is competitive with respect to nadi (for a review,
see douce, 1985). however, in the case of pyruvate
dehydrogenase an increase in the nadh/nad+ molar
ratio decreases the steady-state activity of the complex by
increasing the proportion of the phosphorylated inactive
form of pyruvate dehydrogenase (reed, 1981).
interestingly, the low km for nad+ of glycine oxidation
by the enzymic extract, which is lower than those of
other nad+-linked dehydrogenases (douce, 1985),
indicates that glycine cleavage competes favourably at
the level of matrix nadi. in fact the preferential
oxidation of glycine observed by several groups utilizing
green leaf mitochondria is achieved by a dominance of
complex i over both complex ii and the external nadh
dehydrogenase of the respiratory chain (for a review, see
douce, 1985), by the ability of  xxxg896xxx  to
compete favourably at the level of nadi (present
results) and by the high concentration of glycine
decarboxylase present in the matrix space. however, it is
very likely that green cells in vivo will generally be
respiring in states between 4 and 3, especially under highlight conditions, because the cytosolic atp/adp ratio is
considerable. that is, the rate at which a green cell
respires is limited by the availability of adp for oxidative
phosphorylation. such a situation will lead to an increase
in the matrix nadh/nad+ ratio impeding glycinecleavage functioning. since nadh strongly inhibits
 xxxg896xxx , we are therefore forced to imagine
that, in vivo, nadh produced during the course of
glycine oxidation is reoxidized very rapidly by oxaloacetate, owing to the  xxxg1739xxx  located in
the matrix space working in the reverse direction. in
support of this suggestion a very powerful oxaloacetate
carrier has been characterized in all the plant mitochondria isolated so far (douce & bonner, 1972; woo &
osmond, 1976) with a very high affinity to its substrate.
this rapid malate-oxaloacetate transport shuttle appears
to play an important role in the photorespiratory cycle in
catalysing the transfer of reducing equivalents generated
