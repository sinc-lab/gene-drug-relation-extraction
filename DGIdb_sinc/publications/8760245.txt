whether
functional pz-adrenoceptors

enhanced
sodium transport
(22na
flux at ph 7.50 was 68.1 t 44% above ph 7.00, p < 0.05).
cultured
proximal
tubules also exhibited
basolateral
s6rb
uptake, 65% of which was ouabain sensitive. thus cultured
cells maintain
apical na/h antiport
and basolateral

( 10v6 m), a selective pz-agonist,
stimulated
na-k-atpase
activity by 36 t 6% above control (p < 0.05). the stimulatory
effect was blocked by ici-118551,
a selective l32-antagonist.
to
determine
whether
 xxxd2583xxx -dependent
increases in
na-k-atpase
were dependent on apical sodium entry, apical
entry was blocked with dimethylamiloride
or maximized
with
monensin. both dimethylamiloride
and monensin prevented
 xxxd2583xxx 
activation
of na-k-atpase.
metaproterenolmediated increases in na-k-atpase
activity were associated
with increases in sodium transport
(27 2 10% above control,
p < 0.05), which was prevented
by dimethylamiloride.
in
contrast to  xxxd2401xxx ,
 xxxd2583xxx

in summary, we have shown that functional p2-adrenoceptors
are present on cultured rat proximal
tubules. p2-adrenoceptor

results in increases in
na-k-atpase
and na transport

apical sodium entry.

system is important in the regulation
of renal sodium excretion. whereas activation of the
adrenergic system indirectly controls sodium excretion
by altering systemic and renal hemodynamics as well
as the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (9), catecholamines also directly modulate proximal tubule sodium reabsorption (18). morphological
studies have shown adrenergic nerve endings in direct
contact with basolateral surfaces of proximal tubules
(2). moreover, radioligand binding studies reveal both
al- and az-adrenoceptors in the proximal nephron (19,
29). both al- and az-adrenoceptors increase sodium
uptake in proximal tubules by stimulating apical na/h
antiport (l&31).
the subtype and function of l%adrenoceptors in the
proximal tubule is unclear. in rat kidneys, autoradiographic and radioligand binding studies demonstrate a
predominance of p1-adrenoceptors distributed in glomeruli and distal tubules (36). p2-adrenoceptors have
been reported in the glomeruli and medullary tubules

(17). however, there is evidence that  xxxd2401xxx , a
nonselective p-agonist, stimulates membrane volume
flux (j,) and adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate
(camp) in proximal tubules (3, 20). in addition, we
identified p-adrenoceptors by radioligand binding in
primary cultures of rat proximal tubules (16); however,
the subtype was not defined. recent studies show the
presence of pz-receptor mrnain two different proximal
tubule cell lines (39); however, the function of pzadrenoceptors in proximal tubules is not known.
since we found that p-adrenoceptors were present on
cultured rat proximal tubule cells and p2-mrna has
been found in proximal cell lines, the purpose of these
studies was to determine whether l&adrenoceptors are
present and functional on primary cultures of proximal
tubules. since nonselective p-adrenoceptor agonists
increase proximal tubule sodium transport and since
pz-adrenoceptor agonists activate na-k-adenosinetriphosphatase (na-k-atpase)
in nontransporting
tissues such as skeletal muscle (8), we questioned whether
pz-adrenergic receptor activation was coupled to na-katpase and sodium transport in polarized proximal
tubule cells.
methods
primary cultures. proximal tubule cell isolation techniques
were derived from modification
of methods of vinay et al. (38)
and previously
described
in detail by our laboratory
(34).
briefly, kidneys were removed from male sprague-dawley
rats and digested in collagenase
(272 u/ml) for 30 min at
37°c. proximal
tubules were isolated
by percoll gradient
centrifugation,
and mixed with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium and ham’s nutrient
mixture (dmem-f12)
containing 1.7 nm epidermal
growth factor, 6.5 um transferrin,
10
um dexamethasone,
87 um insulin,
14 mm nahcos, 10%
bovine calf serum, 100 u/ml penicillin
g, 100 ug/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 5 mm nonessential
amino acids, ph 7.40.
proximal
tubules were plated on type i collagen-coated,
6.5-mm diameter,
0.45~urn pore, permeable
supports
and
suspended
in 24-well,
16-mm diameter
culture dishes (for
s6rb uptake studies), and on 12-mm diameter,
0.4~urn pore,
snapwell
permeable
supports suspended in six-well culture
dishes (for 22na transport
studies). the basolateral
surface
was bathed with dmem-f12
containing
10% bovine calf
serum. all studies were done after cells reached confluence
between 6 and 9 days of culture.
measurement
of sodium
flux. unidirectional
apical-tobasolateral
sodium flux was determined
by a modification
of
methods previously
described by our laboratory
(35). transport studies were carried out in a diffusion chamber (costar,
cambridge,
ma) with a continuous
flow of 95% 02-5% co2
and temperature
maintained
at 37°c by a circulating
water
system. the inserts were removed from the six-well plates
and placed in individual
chambers. 22na (1 pci/ml) was added
to solution a (transport

surfaces were exposed to the
same buffer without 22na. initiation
of transport
was defined
as the time when apical buffer was added. the final volume
on both apical and basolateral
sides was 4 ml. aliquots of 100
ul were removed from the basolateral
buffer 10, 20, and 30
min after initiation
of transport.
22na was quantified
by
liquid scintillation
(packard tri-carb
460), and 22na mass
was calculated
from simultaneously
determined
standard
curves. 22na flux was defined as total quantity of basolateral
22na divided by permeable
support surface area. since 22na
transport varied from plate to plate, each experiment
had its
own control. results were expressed
as femtomoles
per
square millimeter.
in studies evaluating
the effect of ph, preincubation
was
performed for 60 min in solution a or sozution b consisting of
(in mm> 136 nacl, 5 nahc03,5

studies were performed
as
above. to determine
the effect of extracellular
ph on sodium
transport,
cells were first acid loaded (exposed to solution b
for 60 min) and then transport
studies were performed
as
described
above with extracellular
ph 7.50 vs. ph 7.00.
changes in the ph were accomplished
by adjusting sozution a
with sodium bicarbonate.

was maintained
by
removing nacl.
measurement
of na-k-atpase
activity. na-k-atpase
activity was determined
by measuring
s6rb uptake in the presence
of ouabain (15). at the time of study, medium was aspirated
from apical and basolateral
sides and replaced with rpm1
buffer (in mm: 102 nacl, 5.6 na2hp04, 5.4 kcl, 0.4 cac12, 0.4
mgs04, 24 hepes, 3 lactate, and 5 glutamine,
ph 7.45). all
studies were of 90-min duration. during the last 30 min, 86rb
(1 pcilm1) w as added to the basolateral
side in the presence or
absence of 2 mm ouabain. at the end of study, supports were
removed and washed with ice-cold mgc12 (100 mm) to stop
flux. the supports
were counted by gamma
scintillation
(packard auto-gamma
scintillation
spectrometer
model 5330).
ouabain-sensitive
s6rb uptake was calculated
as the difference between total counts per minute (cpm) of s6rb and cpm
s6rb in the presence of ouabain. since 86rb uptake varied
from plate to plate, each experiment
had its own control.
ouabain-sensitive
86rb uptake was converted to k uptake
and expressed
as picomoles
of k uptake per microgram
protein per minute.
first the amount (pmol) of 86rb was
calculated
by comparison
of sample cpm to cpm obtained
using standard
solutions of 86rb of known specific activity.
uptake of 86rb was converted to k uptake based on assumption of proportional
behavior and using the equation
[k]; =
[k] 0 x ( [86rb]./[86rb]
where the subscripts
“i” and “0”

indicate the intracellular
and extracellular
concentrations,
respectively (25). [86rb]o was 0.004651 mmol/l (86rb 1 uci/ml,
specific activity = 2.5 mci/mg). [k], was 5.4 mmol/l. hence,
[86rb]d[k]o was 0.0861296 x 10m2.

was added to basolateral
surfaces of
confluent monolayers for 7 min at 37oc. cells were then lysed
with 0.01 n hcl. the supernatant

1251-labeled camp and 100 ul antiserum
for 3 h at 4°c. the
suspension was then incubated with a second polymer-bound
antibody for 10 min at 21°c then centrifuged
at 1,500g for 30
min at 4°c. 1251 in the antibody-bound

results

we first conducted studies to characterize na-katpase and na/h antiport in the control of sodium
transport in cultured proximal tubule cells. ouabainsensitive s6rb uptake was used to estimate na-katpase activity. we found 68.3 t 1.7% (n = 9) of the
total @rb uptake was ouabain sensitive. basal na-katpase activity was 3.8 ? 0.6 pmol kq@.min-l.
basal sodium transport was reduced by 66.1 t 12.3%
(n = 3) in cells exposed to 10°c (22na flux = 124
fmol/mm2 at 37°c and 42 fmol/mm2 at 1ooc).this data
indicates that in cultured proximal tubule cells, approximately two-thirds of sodium transport is active and
na-k-atpase dependent.
we next determined the role of apical sodium entry
on sodium transport. since proximal tubule sodium
transport is mediated, in part, by apical na./h antiport,
we first compared cells that had been acid loaded (ph
6.9) with cells that had not been acid loaded. the
results are shown in fig. 1a. acid loading resulted in
increased 22na flux (22na flux = 150 t 23% of control).
figure 1b shows that after acid loading, raising extracellular ph further increased sodium transport (22na
flux at extracellular ph 7.50 was 168 ? 44% of that at
ph 7.00). these data indicate that proximal tubule cells
in culture express apical na/h antiport. since apical
sodium entry regulates basolateral na-k-atpase activity in vivo, we next determined the effect of sodium
entry on na-k-atpase in cultured proximal tubule
epithelial cells. figure 2a shows that dimethylamiloride (which, at the concentration used, inhibits na/h
antiport and sodium entry) decreased na-k-atpase
activity. in addition, monensin, a sodium ionophore,
increased na-k-atpase activity. since dimethylamilo-

(monensin, 119 ? 2%; monensin

associated with 23 t 5% decreases in 22na flux. decreases in na-k-atpase and 22na flux after dimethylamiloride were comparable. these data indicate that in
cultured proximal tubule cells, apical sodium entry is
an important determinant of basolateral na-k-atpase
and transcellular sodium transport.
to determine the effect of p2-adrenoceptor activation
on na-k-atpase and sodium transport, cells were
exposed to selective p2-agonist,  xxxd2583xxx . exposure to  xxxd2583xxx  resulted in activation of na-katpase (fig. 3). compared with basal values, na-katpase activity was increased by 36% after 90 min. to
determine whether the effect of  xxxd2583xxx  was
mediated through p2-adrenoceptors, experiments were
performed in the presence of the selective p2-antagonist, ici-118551. figure 4 shows that the stimulatory
effect of  xxxd2583xxx  on na-k-atpase was blocked
by the p2-antagonist. ici-118551 alone did not affect
basal na-k-atpase activity. these results indicated
that p2-adrenoceptors activate na-k-atpase in cultured proximal tubule cells.
the stimulatory
effect of p2-agonists on na-katpase could be on apical sodium entry or on na-katpase itself. to answer this question, p2-adrenoceptor
control of na-k-atpase was determined in the presence of the apical sodium entry blockade. as shown in
fig. 5, apical sodium entry blockade with dimethylamiloride prevented  xxxd2583xxx -mediated increases
in na-k-atpase activity. moreover, when apical sodium entry was maximized with monensin,  xxxd2583xxx  did not increase na-k-atpase above that seen
with the ionophore. we considered the possibility that
the failure of  xxxd2583xxx  to increase na-k-atpase
in the presence of monensin resulted from the fact that
monensin maximized na-k-atpase. this seemed unlikely, however, since monensin-induced increases (1620%) in na-k-atpase were less than those caused by
 xxxd2583xxx  (30-35%). in addition,  xxxg99xxx 
(10e7 m, 90 m in ) a1so caused increases na-k-atpase
that were not blocked with monensin (data not shown).

discussion

proximal tubule epithelial cells in culture have been
utilized for signaling studies, but there are limited data
on na transport. to better characterize vectorial sodium transport in cultured proximal tubule cells, we
conducted studies on the role of na/h exchange and
na-k-atpase. our results suggest that proximal tubule cells in culture reproduce results from microperfusion studies. there is apical na/h exchange as evidenced by the observation that cellular acidification
and apical buffer alkalinization enhanced sodium transport. there is basolateral na-k-atpase, which is driven
by apical sodium entry, since decreases in sodium entry
(dimethylamiloride)
decreased pump activity while increases in sodium entry (monensin) increased pump
activity. moreover, most sodium transport was active

p2-adrenergic

receptors

(transcellular)
as evidenced by the fact that sodium
transport
was reduced by -67%  xxxd1891xxx °c.
while a-adrenoceptors
have been identified on proximal tubules, the presence of p-adrenoceptors
in this
nephron segment is controversial
(18, 32). we recently
demonstrated
the presence of p-adrenoceptors
in cultured proximal tubule cells using radioligand
binding
and signaling techniques
(16). the current
study extends these earlier observations
by demonstrating
the
presence of functional
pz-adrenoceptors
on cultured
proximal tubule cells. pz-adrenoceptor
activation
with
a selective l&agonist,
 xxxd2583xxx ,
resulted in activation of na-k-atpase,
an effect which was abrogated
by the selective pz-adrenoceptor
antagonist
ici-118551.
moreover, increases
in na-k-atpase
were associated
with increases in active sodium transport.
p2-adrenoceptors have been shown to be coupled to na-k-atpase
in nonpolarized
systems such as skeletal muscle, where
p2-adrenoceptor
activation results in potassium
movement from the extracellular
to intracellular
compartment (8). these transcellular
shifts in potassium
have
been postulated
to mediate p2-adrenoceptor-induced
hypokalemia.
in addition,
l&-adrenoceptors
activate
na-k-atpase
in erythrocytes
and brain (5). there are
limited data on pz-adrenoceptor
coupling
to na-katpase in polarized tissues such as proximal tubules.
while norepinephrine
was found to activate
renal
na-k-atpase,
norepinephrine
predominantly
activates ar-adrenoceptors.
moreover,
the norepinephrine
studies were performed
on cortical homogenates,
a
preparation
that contains multiple nephron segments
in addition to proximal tubules. our data clearly indicate that l&adrenoceptors
activate na-k-atpase
in
proximal tubule epithelial cells.
our results also indicate that in cultured
proximal
tubule cells, p2-adrenoceptors
are indirectly
coupled to
na-k-atpase.
pz-adrenoceptor
activation
of na-katpase was prevented by both sodium entry blockade
with dimethylamiloride
and maximizing
sodium entry
with monensin. these results are consistent
with models of proximal tubule function in which apical sodium
entry through
na/h exchange
is a determinant
of
proximal tubule sodium reabsorption
(3a). moreover,
the lack of l&adrenoceptor-generated
camp responses
is also consistent
with currently
proposed models of
proximal
tubule function,
since camp-dependent
kinases inhibit sodium transport
in proximal tubules by
inhibiting
na/h exchange (23, 27). although a number
of hormone agonists have been shown to be coupled to
na/h antiport
in proximal
tubules,
l&adrenoceptor
coupling to na/h antiport
has not been reported
in
either polarized
or nonpolarized
tissues
(1, 21). to
determine the functional effect of pz-adrenoceptor
coupling to na/h antiport and na-k-atpase,
we measured
22na transport
across cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. in concert with the aforementioned
increases
in transporter
activity, p2-adrenoceptor
activation
resulted in increases
in proximal
tubule sodium transport.
the signaling
pathway
mediating
p2-adrenoceptor
action in proximal tubule is not known. although camp

in the

kidney

f75

transduces
p2-adrenoceptor
activation in many tissues,
this does not appear to occur in proximal tubule cells,
since exposure
to  xxxd2583xxx 
failed to elicit increases in camp. p2-adrenoceptors
have been reported
to regulate cell functions independent
of protein kinase
a. for example, in proximal
tubules,
isoproterenolinduced depolarizations
are camp independent
(22,
28). in addition to  xxxg1836xxx , other short-term
regulators
of na/h antiport include protein kinase c, g
proteins,
and calciumcalmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase (11, 13, 33). since other hormone agonists such
as angiotensin
ii and ar-adrenoceptors
activate na/h
exchange in proximal
tubules through
protein kinase
c, this signaling system could mediate p2-adrenoceptor
action in proximal tubules (24). however, p2-adrenoceptors have not been reported
to be coupled to protein
kinase c. in addition, protein kinase c has dual effects
on sodium transporters
in the proximal tubules. while
protein kinase c activates
na/h antiport,
protein kinase c phosphorylates
and inactivates
na-k-atpase
(4,26). thus the role of protein kinase c in transducing
p2-adrenoceptor
activation
in proximal tubule epithelial cells remains to be elucidated. finally, it is possible
that the effects observed were mediated by serotonin
receptors,
since there is cross-reactivity
and homology
between serotonin and adrenoceptors
in the kidney (7).
the adrenergic
nervous
system regulates
sodium
excretion in multiple ways. of special importance
are
the effects of adrenergic
activation
on systemic
and
renal hemodynamics
and glomerular
filtration
rate. in
addition, there are direct adrenergic
effects on proximal tubule function
(18). adrenergic
nerve endings
have been demonstrated
on proximal
tubules
(2).
whereas
(x1- and a2-adrenoceptor
control of proximal
tubule function
is well documented,
p-adrenoceptor
control of proximal
tubule function is less certain (11,
3 1). autoradiographic
and radioligand
binding studies
showed l+adrenoceptor
distribution
predominantly
in
glomeruli
and distal tubules
and p2-adrenoceptor
in
glomeruli and medullary
tubules (17,36). there appear
to be species differences in the distribution
of p-adrenoceptors. one group demonstrated
pz-adrenoceptor-mediated camp production
in canine but not rat proximal
tubules
(30). moreover,
while
neither
pl- nor p2blockade alters the antinatriuretic
response
to renal
nerve stimulation,
 xxxd2401xxx -induced
stimulation
of jv, depolarization,
and increases in camp production
have been reported in rat proximal tubules (10,20,22).
pi-mrna
has been demonstrated
in mct, llc-pk,
and hamster
proximal
tubules
(37, 39). earlier
we
demonstrated
that p-adrenoceptors
are present on cultured rat proximal
tubule epithelial
cells (16). the
current results extend this information
by demonstrating the presence
of functional
p2-adrenoceptors
on
cultured proximal tubule epithelial cells.
an important
caveat to our studies is the concentrations of the p2-agonist (1 um) that we used. while these
concentrations
are greater than basal circulating
catecholamines
(l-5 nm), much higher levels are found in
stress situations
(e.g., lo-50 nm) or in pheochromocytoma (100-500
nm) (6, 14). moreover,

catecholamine
excretion is 0.5-0.75 umol/24 h. furthermore, in sodium-retaining
states such as cirrhosis
or
circulating
catecholamines
congestive
heart failure,
are high, and renal cortical catecholamines
could reach
the concentration
used in our studies.
in summary,
we have demonstrated
the presence of
functional
pz-adrenoceptors
in cultured
rat proximal
tubules.
pz-adrenoceptor
activation
results
in increases in na-k-atpase
and in sodium transport.
both
of these effects result from increases in apical na entry.
