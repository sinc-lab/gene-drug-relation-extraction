we developed a method for the simultaneous determination of drug affinity constants for rat ly,~-and ff~a-~drenoceptor
subtypes by using [“h]rx821002 radioligand binding in the kidney. three competition curves were obtained for each drug: one
for the test compound in the absence of arc 239 (a drug found to have io&fold higher affinity for (~~a- than for
a,,-adrencccptors),
one in the presence of arc: 239, and one for arc 239. it is possible to determine the k,s of a tested drug
for both cystand ry,,-adrenoceptors by simultaneous computer modelling because of the increased constraint in the calculations
given by the inch&& of arc 239 into the assay. using this approach, we found guanfacine and oxymetazoline to be highly
ryz,-selective. the most a,,-selective
were arc 239,  xxxd3000xxx  and co~nanthinc.
a number of other drugs, for example
uk-14,304, rilmenidine and clonidine, were non-selective or showed minor selectivity for tyta- or a,,-adrenoceptors.
moreover,
using monte carlo simulations, we showed that the three-curve method gives more accurate estimates of drug binding constants
for assays when two receptor sites arc present than methods analysing only one competition curve.

i. introduction

radioligand binding studies in a variety of mammalian species and tissues have shown that cy,-adrenoceptors exist in at least two pharmacologically distinguishable subtypes, termed aza and azb (cheung et
al., 1982; nahorski et al., 1985; petrash and bylund,
1986; bylund et al., 1988; for review see bylund, 1988).
moreover, three human (kobilka et al., 1987; regan et
al., 1988; lomasney et al., 1990) and two rat (zeng et
al,, 1990; chalberg et al,, 1990) ~~-adren~eptors
have
been cloned, sequenced and expressed in mammalian
cell lines. in the course of our studies on a,-adrenoceptors we recently observed that [3h]rx821002 labelled both aza. and cw,,-adrenoceptors in the rat
kidney: 14% of the receptors were of the tuz,,-subtype
and 86% of the czza-subtype. in the present study we
took advantage of this property of [‘h]rx821002 to
determine simultaneously drug binding constants for
in the kidney, using a
cyzi\- and azn- adrenoceptors
computer modelling approach. we evaluated some new

2. i. metnbrane preparatiot?
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were
decapitated and their kidneys rapidly excised and homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm tris-hci, 5 mm edta,
0.1 mm pmsf (pbenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride), 10
@g/ml soybean  xxxd207xxx  and 200 ,ug/ml t?acltracin, ph 7.5, using a motor-driven teflon glass homogenizer. the homogenates were spun at 500 xg,
and the superllatants were collected and spun at 38000
xg for 30 min. the pellets were then washed once
with the same buffer and then once again with a
similar buffer containing a lower concentration of
edta (1.5 mm). the final pellets were diluted to
protein concentrations of about 2.4 mg l?rotein/ml
with 50 mm tris-mci, 1.5 mm edta. ph 7.x aliquots
of the membranes were frozen and stored at -80°c
until used, protein was determined according to the
method of lowry et al. (1951).

radioligand binding was performed by incubating
about 240 p g of the membranes in 150 fl i of 1 mm
edta, i(io $iv gpp(nh)p (guanyl-s’-yl-imido-diphosphatr), 140 mm naci. 33 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5 with
[‘h]rxs21003 and drugs, as indicated, for 1 h at 25°c.
assays were stopped by filtering the incubation mixture through whatman gf/c fibre glass filterpapers
and washing the filters with 20 ml ice-cold 50 mm
t&cl.
ph 7.5, using a cell harvester (brandel.
gaithersburg. md, u.s.a.). the filters were then
placed in three millilitrcs of ready protein” scintillation cocktail (beckman instruments) and counted in a
beckman ls 1801 p-counter. the counting efficiency
was determined by using an external standard and the
beckman instruments h-number method. assays were
performed in duplicate.
2.3. stcrtisricalr7lrtiwds

computer modeiling of radioligand binding data
was performed essential!y as described (de lean et al.,
198; bergstrijm and wikberg, 19x6) by using programmes coded by us suitable for the macintosh and
ibm-pc computers. in brief the experimental data
were fitted to the equation:

+

n, f,

(1)

by using marquardts algorithm for non-linear regression analysis !marquardt, 1063). the equation assumes
that ligands bound reversibly to independent sites according to the isw of mass action. in the formula b, is
the concentration of ligand i bound to the membranes,
k,, and k,, the affinity constants for ligand i and a for
receptor b, respectively, fi and e, the free concentrations of ligands i and a, respectively, r, the concentration of receptor site b, and ni the constant ratio of
bound/free (i.e. non-specific binding) for ligand i. the
free concentrations of liganc’s were estimated numerically from their total concentrations, as described by
de lean et al. (1982). residuals were weighted according to the reciprocal of their expected variance using
the formula var(b) = a,, + a, . j3;‘: (eq. 2) (see de lean
et al., ly82). constants used were atr = 3 x 10m7, a i = 3
x io-' and a3 = 1.5, which approximated the variance
when the reactants were expressed in nanomolar concentrations. in the calculations, all of the curves from a
separate experiment were fitted simultaneously by setting the appropriate values for n (number of sites) and
m (number of ligands) and arranging the data fed to
the computer algorithm appropriately. moreover, several separate fits were performed for each set of data
assuming that one or several sites were present. an

f-test comparing the sums of squares for the different
models (see de lean et al., 1982) was then used to
judge which model approximated the data the best.
this procedure to select the best model is referred to
as computer modelling.
2.4. monte carlo simulations

for the purpose of testing the aj1 over behaviour of
the computer modelling methods, theoretical competiton curves were generated by applying standard methods (bard, ly74) to eq. (1) as well as by using eq. (2) to
calculate the variance for the data points. the same
procedure as above was used to estimate the free
ligand from the total. for each set of data, three
competition curves with 16 assays each were generated
in order to simulate data obtained in the present study
(see results for details). the simulated data were then
subjected to computer modelling as detailed under
results. programmes were coded for turbo pascal*
for pc computers and light speed pascal@’ for macintosh.

~“h]iw?21002 for rat kidney (y?.~-aud a,,-adrenoceptors

preliminary experiments
indicated that [“h]rx
821002 bound to both lye,,-and cy?,-adrenoceptors in

237

rat kidney membranes. in order to obtain binding
constants for [ “hlrx821002 at the two sites, saturation
curves for [‘h]rx821002 were made by adding various
concentrations of the tritiated ligand to the incubation
mixtures in the absence and presence of 100 nm arc
239 or 1 pm bdf 8933 (bdf 8933 was used to define
non-specific binding). moreover, in the same experiment, competition curves for arc 239 were obtained
by adding various concentrations of arc 239 in the
presence of fixed concentrations of [“h]rx821002 (w
0.6, 2 and 8 nm, respectively) (fig. 1). all data were
then simultaneously subjected to computer model!ing.
the analysis indicated that a two-site model approximated the data the best, since fitting the data to a
two-site model resulted in a drastic reduction in the
sums of squares as compared to fitting the data to a
one-site model (p < 0.001). moreover, fitting the data
to a three-site model did not cause significant further
reduction in the sums of squares compared to the
two-site model, from nine separate experiments the
k,s of [‘h]rx821002 for a,,-sites and ala-sites were
estimated to be 0.678 f 0.036 and 4.58 k 0.20 nm
(mean t_ s.e.m.; n = 91, with capacities 14.6 k 0.9 and
96.6 + 5.7 fmol/mg protein, respectively. i’he k,s of
arc 239 for (ye,,-sites and a&tes
were determined
to be 1570 + 200 and 15.0 + 1.3 nm (n = 9), respectively. these differences in drug affinity are clearly
reflected in the curves shown in fig. 1. firstly, the
competition curves shown in fig. 1c are biphasic, rcfleeting the * loo-fold higher affinity of arc 239 for
cyz,-adrenoceptors. secondly, as the concentration of
[3h]rx821002 increased from 0.6 to 8 nm, the proportion of the competition curve that correspond to com. .
petition at a,,-sites (the upper sigmoid part of the
curve) increased relative to that resulting from compe. .
tltlon at a,,-sites (the lower sigmoid part of the curve).
this is because [“h]rx821002 binds mainly to crzaadrenoceptors at low concentrations. more ly,,-adrenoceptors will became occupied when the concentration
of [3h]rx821002 is increased. moreover, as can bc
seen from the scatchard transform of the saturation
studies (fig. la), the curve representing total specific
binding is slightly curved, reflecting the binding of
[“h]rx821002 to two sites. when 100 nm arc 239
was added the transform was seen as a sharply bent
curve. this is because 100 nm of arc 239 will compete substantially with [‘h]rx821002 at a,,-sites but
not at a,,,-sites, thus reducing the slope of the transform at high but not at low concentrations of the
radioligand.

out of nine showing essentially the sal~r results.

competition curves were constructed for each drug,
both in the absence and in the presence of a fixed
concentration of arc 239 (200 nm). a full competition curve for arc 239 was also obtained (fig. 2). the
three curves were then subjected to simultaneous computer modelling.
figure 2 shows six representative experiments. the
competition curves of arc 239 were strongly biphasic.

presence of arc 239 the biphasicity of the  xxxd3000xxx 
competition curve was eliminated, so that the curve
covered only the low affinity range of the original
 xxxd3000xxx  competition curve. this pattern indicates the
a,,-selectivity of  xxxd3000xxx .
in contrast, the (ye,,-selective drug oxymetazoline
(bylund et al., 1988) gave a completely different pattern (fig. 2b). the competition curve for oxymetazoline
obtained in the presence of arc 239 covered only the
high affinity range of the original oxymetazoline competition curve. this pattern demonstrates the cy**selectivity of oxymetazoline.
figure 2c,d show results for (-i-adrenaline
and
w-14,304.
f’he competition curves for these compounds obtained in the absence and in the presence of
arc 239, covered exactly the same concentration

several of the drug competition curves obtained in the
absence of arc 239 were also clearly biphasic or bent.
in contrast, all drug competition curves were uniphasic
when 3w nm arc 239 was present. simultaneous
computer modelling of the three curves of each experiment showed that a two-site model fitted the data the
jest. thus. fitting the data to a two-site model resulted
in highly significant decreases in the sums of squares
(p < 0.001) compared to when a one-site model was
used. three-site models gave only insignificant reductions in the sums of squares compared to the two-site
model.
as can be seen from fig. 2, different patterns were
obtained depending on which drug was tested. figure
2a shows results for  xxxd3000xxx , a drug which is (y?~selective, like arc 239 (bylund et al., 1988). in the

and uk-14,304 are non-selective for kidney a,-adrenoceptor subtypes.
figure 2e shows results for the cu,-adrenoceptor
agonist guanfacine. the pattern obtained was the same
as that for oxymetazoline. the pattern for brl 44408,,
a drug claimed to be an a,,-selective antagonist (young
et al., 19891, was similar to that for oxymetazoline and
guanfacine (fig. 2f).
table 1 summarizes the results from the analysis of
22 drugs, all assayed in an identical fashion as shown in
fig. 2. the most cy*,-selective drug was arc 239,
which had a iv3-fold selectivity.  xxxd3000xxx  and corynanthine were also (~*a-selective (26- and 17-fold, respectively). the most aza-selective drugs were guanfacine
and oxymetazoline (60 and 51-fold, respectively), followed by brl 44408, which showed 35fold a,,-selectivity. rauwolscine showed minor ru,,-selectivity (9selectivity was found for  xxxd2241xxx 
fold). minor lye*and fla 151 (20- and 13-fold, respectively). other
drugs showed virtually the same affinity for the (ye*and a,,-adrenoceptors.
the data from the computer
calculations indicated that the proportions of (y?table

adrenoceptor sites labelled by [“hlrx821002 in the
kidney membranes were 14 & 0.5% for (y?* and 86 f
0.5% for (y?~(n = 33).
3.3. monte carlo sitndations
in order to verify the ability of the present approach
to determine binding constants for drugs in radioligand
assays when two sites are present, competition experiments were simulated by using the monte carlo approach. in these tests 12 hypothetical compounds with
systematic variations in selectivitiy for (y~*- and cyzbsites were analysed. three competition curves were
obtained by simulation for each compound, as is detailed under methods, using the same design as described in paragraph 3.2. a random normally distributed error was added to the data to simulate experimental variations, as shown in fig. 3. five simulations
were performed for each drug. the data were then
analysed by computer modelling, and the results are
summarized in table 2. with the three-curve approach
to simultaneously analyse the data of each experiment
our prediction of drug k,s by computer modelling was

simultaneously fitted to a model on the assumption that ligands bound to two independent sites according to the law of mass action (e.g. the
three-curve approach). all tests indicated that a two site model gave statistically significant (p < 0.001) better fits than a one-site model. a shows

good. for comparison, the data were also analysed by
compute: modehing of the competition curve of the
tested drug (e.g. a standard one-curve experimental
design). as can be seen from table 2, this procedure
predicted binding constants only for compounds with
high selectivity ratios. moreover, for these compounds
the errors in the estimates of drug k,s were much
higher than when the three-curve approach was used.

oceptors. qur data confirm that [‘h]rx821002 is a
good radioligand for a,-adrenoceptors
(langin et al.,
1489; galitzky et al., 1990). the ligand shows negligible
non-specific binding (less than 3% of the total binding)
thereby providing a high signal to noise ratio. our
results show that [“h]rx821002 labels kidney aza’
adrenoceptors
with m 7-fold higher affinity than it
labels ~*a-adreno~~ptors. in comparison to ~~~jyohimbine and ~~~)rauwolscine, which are two popular radiohgands used to assay ~~-adrenoceptors,
[“hjrx

affinity and much lower non-specific binding. moreover, our data indicate that rauwolscine and yohimbine
may be slightly tr,,-selective for rat kidney cu2-adreno-

(table 11. this makes it difficult to use
i3hlyohimbine or [“hlrauwolscine to zssay both lyzadrenoceptor
subtypes in the kidney as binding to
cy,,-adrenoceptors will predominate.
with respect to nomenclature we chose to refer to
the cu,-adrenoceptors of the kidney as ‘rat ayza’and
‘rat ~*a’. the classification is according to the original
classification of bylund (19851, i.e. a,,-types have low
affinity for  xxxd3000xxx  and a,,-types high affinity for
 xxxd3000xxx , whereas the opposite is valid for oxymetazoline. however, there is reason to believe that there are
species differences for a,-adrenoceptors
(see for example michel et al., 1989b; brown et al., 1990; connaughton and docherty, 1990) and that this has added
confusion to the nomenclature of a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes. we therefore prefer to refer to our receptors
as ‘rat-types’. besides, we regard our nomenclature as
provisional since, in the future, molecular cloning data
and pharmacological data will serve as a basis for a
rational nomenclature of a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes.
the increased accuracy of the three-curve method
now described is accomplished by the inclusion into
each experiment of arc 239, a drug which we found
to have 108-fold higher affinity for rat cola- than for
a,,-adrenoceptors.
the inclusion of a cuil competition
curve for arc 239 accurately defines the proportions
of aza- and (~~a-adlenoceptor sites when the data is
subjected to computer modelling. this will in turn help
to define the k,s for the tested drug since the magnitude of the proportion of sites will not be dependent
solely on data frcm the competition curve for the
tcstcd drug. moreover, the affinity of the tested drug
for a,,-adrenoceptorj p is unambigously derived from
the competition curve for the drug obtained in the
ceptors

presence of 200 nm arc 239. at this concentration
arc 239 will nearly completely block the binding of
[“h]rx81002 to (~~a-adrenoceptors, without affecting
binding to ayzaadrenoceptors. since ali k, values are
determined by simultaneous computer modelling of all
curves, the k, value of a tested drug for a,,-adrenoceptors can be determined accurately, because the
possible values for this parameter are restricted when
the other parameters are defined accurately.
our method appears to be useful to determine drug
k,s of both agonists and antagonists for the cu,-adrenoceptor subtypes. it is well known that agonists may
bind to a high affinity conformation of the a,-adrenoceptors consisting of a ternary complex with agonist,
receptor and a g-protein, as well as to a low affinity
conformation, consisting of the receptor uncoupled
from its g-protein (see hoffman et al., 1980a,b; hoffman and lefkowitz, 1982; van megen et al., 1990). in
the present study we obtained competition curves using
an incubation buffer containing edta, gpp(nh)p
and naci. the reason for this was that a number of
previous studies have indicated that the,;? conditions
will eliminate the high affinity conformation of the
a,-adrenoceptor,
so that agonists only bind to the low
affinity conformation of the receptor (snavely and insel, 1982; u’prichard, 1984; nunnari et al., 1987;
schloos et al., 1987, michel et al., 1989a). snavely and
lnsel (1982) showed that these conditions rendered
(- jepinephrine competition curves in the rat kidney
resolvable into only one-site fits when they used
[ “hlyohimbine as radioligand in conjunction with computer modelling procedures similar to those described
in the present paper. ([‘hlyohimbine is expected to
adrenoceptors in the rat kidlabel predommantely myraney because of its slightly higher affinity for this receptor type and the predominance of  xxxg1352xxx ,-adrenoceptors
in the organ). moreover, we have recently shown for a
pure rat a,,-adrenoceptor
system (the rat spinal cord)
that edta, gpp(nh)p and nacl render ( - iepinzphrine competition curves resolvable into one-site fits
(uhlen and wikberg, submitted manuscript). the data
of our present study are consistent with the notion that
high affinity conformations of cy,-adrenoceptors for
agonists do not interfere in the assays because the
two-site model described the experimental data equally
well for both agonists and antagonists (cf. the computer
fitted curves for the agonists (-)-adrenaline,
uk14,304, oxymetazoline and guanfacine with the computer
fitted curves for the antagonists  xxxd3000xxx  and
brl 44408 in fig. 2).
we have shown that guanfacine is selective for ff?aadrenoceptors in the rat kidney. guanfacine has never
before been reported to be an a,-adrenoceptor
subtype selective
drug. another substance which has been
described as a,,-selective
is oxymetazolinc (bylund,
1988). the at,,- selectivity of guanfacine was similar to

that of olymetazoline.
apart from these two corn-pounds. there do not appear to bc many q,,,-selective
compounds. young et al. (ly8y) found that brl 44408
tv3s 7:-fold more selective for a,,-adrcnoceptors
than
for fljk-adrenoceptors in the rat cerebral cortex, using
[-‘h]rau\volscine as lahcllcd ligand. thcst: investigators
found oqmctazoline
to be 31-fold more selective for
ruz,-adrenoceptors
than for n_.a-adr-enoceptors when
assayed in the same way. in our present
study we
found brl 44408 to be 35fold selective for the crz,lcompared to the ‘y?~-adrenoceptors in the rat kidney,
whereas oxymetazoline was 5 l-fold more selective.
thus, our data is consistent with that of young et al.
(1989). nevertheless, since gene cloning data show that
there arc more than two species of cu:-adrenoccptors
(lomasney et a]., 19%); zeng et al.. 1990: chalberg et
a!., lyy11).more studies are required to compare various cy,-adlenoceptors before one can establish their
similar or dissimilar natures with certainty.
previous studies of the pharmacology of guanfacine
do not give much indication that its a,,,-selectivity
plays a role in its pharmacological properties (see van
zwieten. ly86; scholtysik and fetkovska, 1987). however, in a rcccnt study we observed that whereas the
antinociceptive effect of intrathecal uk-14,304 was
highly susceptible to up-regulation after chronic depletion of spinal cord noradrenaline, the antinociceptive
effect of intrathecal guanfacine was not (uhlcn et al.,
1990). since our data (table 1) indicate that uk-14,304
is non-selective. it is tempting to speculate that the
difference in susceptibility for the regulation of guanfacine and uk-14,304 effects is caused by the difference in their selectivity for a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes.
it was interesting that whereas fla 151 was clearly
a,,,-adrenoceptor
selective, fla 163 was non-selective
(table 1). both compounds are structurally similar
guanidinium analogues, the only difference being that
fla 1.51possess two chlorine atoms at position 2 and
6 whereas fla 163 contains only one at the 2 position
of the aromatic ring. moreover, guanfacine and  xxxd2241xxx , which were found to be a?,,-adrenoceptor selective (table 11, are structurally similar to fla 1.51 as
they also have 2,6-chlorine substitutions in their aromatic rings. this information should be useful for the
future design of new a,-adrenoceptor
subtype-selective
ligands.
in summary, we have developed a method for the
simultaneous determination of drug binding constants
for ~r?,~- and a,,-adrenoceptors.
using a computer
modelling approach. our experimental design takes
advantage of the labelling of both a?,,- and a?,-adrenoceptors in the rat kidney by [“h]rx821002 and of the
ability of arc 239 to markedly distinguish between
these sites. by simultaneous computer analysis of drug
and arc 239 competition curves, as wei] as drug
competition curves obtained in the presence of a fixed

concentration of arc 239, the k,s of tested drugs can
be determined accurately. using this approach we evaluated some new a,-adrenoceptor
subtype selective
d;ugs. of these, guanfacine was found to be strongly
a?,,-selective.
