a b s t r a c t
in order to explain cognition-enhancing effects of standardized  xxxd2199xxx  extract (egb761® ), an
increase of central monoaminergic neurotransmission has been suggested, but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. here, we conﬁrm that the norepinephrine ( xxxg2148xxx ), the serotonin
(sert), the dopamine (dat) uptake transporters and mao activity are inhibited by egb761® in vitro,
although rather high concentrations are required for inhibition of mao-a and mao-b activity. however,
after 14 days of daily oral treatment with 100 mg/kg egb761® only ne uptake is signiﬁcantly decreased in
nmri mice, while 5-ht uptake and mao activity are not affected. as synaptic dopamine clearance in the
frontal cortex is mediated by  xxxg2148xxx , not dat, these ﬁndings may give an explanation for the enhancement
of dopaminergic neurotransmission by egb761® seen in animal models, presumably linked to its positive
effects on cognition and attention.

1. introduction
 xxxd2199xxx  has a long history of medical use for treating conditions of cerebral dysfunction associated with brain aging and
neurodegenerative dementia [1,2]. substantial evidence for clinical
efﬁcacy of standardized extracts (egb761® ) exists [3,4,5,6], even if
this topic is still a matter of scientiﬁc debate [6,7,8]. many molecular
mechanisms have been suggested to explain its ability to alleviate
or even improve cognitive impairment associated with brain aging
or dementia, such as improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction
[9,10,11], inhibition of amyloid beta-neurotoxicity [12,13], improvement of membrane ﬂuidity parameters [14,15] or attenuation of
increased oxidative stress [11,16]. all these mechanisms share close
relationship to the current understanding of the neuropathology
of alzheimer’s disease [16,17,18]. however, additional mechanisms
might be assumed as egb761® also seems to have behavioral effects
in man and animals not easily explainable with the mechanisms
given above [19,20,21]. for example, egb761® has been reported
to elevate biogenic amine levels in animals [22,23], but investi-

gations into the underlying mechanisms have been inconclusive
so far. earlier ﬁndings addressing this issue found that egb761®
affects synaptosomal uptake of biogenic amines in vitro [24], but in
vivo signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings was not demonstrated. ramassamy et al. [24] also found that egb761® at very low concentrations
enhances synaptosomal serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht))
uptake similar to the antidepressant drug tianeptine. studies for
other uptake transporters (e.g.  xxxg2148xxx ) are yet lacking. several groups
have reported in vitro  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) inhibiting properties of egb761® [22,25,26], but again in vivo relevance of these
ﬁndings has been challenged by negative ﬁndings in functional and
biochemical studies [27,22]. accordingly, we performed a comparative in vitro and in vivo study on the possible effects of egb761® on
synaptosomal uptake of biogenic amines and on mao-a and mao-b
activity.
2. materials and methods

2.2. animals and treatment procedures
female nmri mice (naval medical research institute; 3 months
old, body weights from 25–30 g) were obtained from harlanwinkelmann (borchen, germany); female wistar rats were from
charles river (sulzfeld, germany). all animals were housed and
treated in strict accordance with the guidelines of the german protection of animals act.
for acute treatment studies, the mice were randomly assigned
to groups of 10 animals per group. animals were weighed, and
received individually dosed oral treatments according to their body
weights in 0.2% agarose as vehicle, or vehicle only. they were killed
1 or 4 h after treatment for determination of acute ex vivo effects.
for subchronic treatment studies, mice were randomly assigned to
groups of 10 animals per group and received the treatments once
daily, adjusted to their body weight and were killed 24 h after the
last treatment for the determination of subchronic ex vivo effects.
2.3. synaptosomal uptake assays
the synaptosomal uptake assays were performed as published
earlier [28]. brieﬂy, freshly obtained brain tissue from either nmri
mice or wistar rats was immediately homogenized with a potter
s homogenizer (b. braun, melsungen, germany) with 10 strokes
at 300 rpm in 15 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose solution and subsequently diluted with another 10 ml. the nuclear fraction was
eliminated by centrifugation (10 min at 750 × g; 0–4 ◦ c) and the
supernatant again centrifuged (20 min at 17400 × g; 0–4 ◦ c) to
obtain the crude synaptosomal pellet. the pellet was resuspended
in modiﬁed ice-cold krebs-hepes buffer (ph 7.4, nacl 150 mm, kcl
6.2 mm, na2 hpo4 1.2 mm,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2 mm, hepes 10 mm, glucose
10 mm,  xxxd228xxx  1% and  xxxd2850xxx  10 ␮m) to different concentrations of wet weight/ml depending on the assay performed: 5-ht
50 mg/ml (frontal cortex, nmri mice), ne 35 mg/ml (occipital cortex, nmri mice), da 25 mg/ml (striatum, wistar rat). uptake into
synaptosomes was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of test substances. after preincubation at 37 ◦ c (15 min),
all metabolic processes were disrupted in an ice-cold water bath
(4 ◦ c, 5 min), before addition of [3 h] labeled substrates and main
incubation at 37 ◦ c started quantiﬁable uptake (5-ht: 4 min, ne:
10 min, da: 5 min). after ﬁltration with a brandel 24-well harvester
machine and whatman gf/c ﬁlters, ﬁlters were washed three times
(ne-uptake: two times) with 2 ml buffer (or ice-cold 0.9% nacl
solution for da-uptake). radioactivity was determined by liquid
scintillation counting (lsc). all determinations were performed in
triplicates.

2.5. mao activity and uptake measurement in ex vivo studies
in all ex vivo studies, one or two vehicle treated control animals
were killed at the same time as the respective drug treated animals
and investigated in parallel. data were expressed in percent of the
respective control.
2.6. liquid scintillation counting
for determination of radioactively labeled substances, 4 ml
of lumasafe plus® (perkinelmer, rodgau-jügesheim, germany)
were added to samples in “zinsser-mini” tubes (zinsser analytic,
eschborn, germany) and shaken for 2 h on a conventional vertical
shaker. subsequently liquid scintillation counting was performed
in a canberra packard tricarb 1900 tr with 60 s counting time with
optimized protocols.
2.7. statistics
data are presented as means ± sem. to determine ic50 values
in uptake experiments eight concentration points and graphpad
prism 4.03 software’s nonlinear regression analysis were used. for
statistical comparison the following levels of signiﬁcance were
used: p > 0.05: n.s.; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. for statistical comparison
of different treatment groups for ex vivo effects, one-way anova
with dunnett’s multiple comparison test was calculated, with the
respective control group (vehicle treated) as reference.
3. results
first, we investigated possible effects of egb761® on mao activities in vitro and ex vivo after subchronic daily treatment. we found
a preferential mao-a over mao-b inhibition by egb761® (about 10fold, see fig. 1). however, with an ic50 value of close to 200 ␮g/ml
inhibition of mao-a is rather weak. this was supported by ex vivo
experiments, where no effects on mao-a (fig. 2a) or mao-b activities (fig. 2b) were found after 2 weeks of daily oral treatment with
100 mg/kg egb761® . positive control  xxxd2850xxx  (10 mg/kg), a preferential mao-b inhibitor, reduced mao-b activity by about 50% under
these conditions.
next, we investigated effects of egb761® on monoaminergic reuptake transporters in vitro. as shown in fig. 3, egb761®
concentration-dependently inhibited synaptosomal uptake
of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine (ic50 values:
281 ± 148 ␮g/ml, 97 ± 69 ␮g/ml and 35 ± 9 ␮g/ml). to clarify
if the uptake is also affected after oral treatment with egb761® ,
we tested ex vivo effects of acute and subchronic treatment on
5-ht and ne uptake. 1 and 4 h after acute treatment, 5-ht uptake

2.4. mao activity assays
the mao activity assay was performed as published earlier
[28]. in short, aliquots of brain homogenate were diluted 1:5 (v/v)
with assay buffer (k2 hpo4 50 mm, dtt 10 ␮m, edta 2.5 mm, bsa
0.5 mg/ml, ph 7.5), and 50 ␮l thereof were preincubated with 60 ␮l
of the test substances for 30 min at rt. subsequently, after addition
of 30 ␮l of 14 c-5-ht (65 ␮m, for mao-a assay) or 14 c-␤-pe (10 ␮m,
mao-b assay) enzymatic reaction was started in a water bath at
37 ◦ c for 6 min and terminated by addition of 250 ␮l 4 mol/l hcl.
the 14 c-labeled deaminated products are more lipophilic and were
extracted with 1 ml toluene/ethylacetate (1:1) by vigorous shaking
for 1 min 600 ␮l of the organic phase were carefully removed for lsc
quantiﬁcation. “blank” samples were obtained by incubating heat
inactivated brain homogenates (96 ◦ c, 10 min) with radio labeled
substrates. all determinations were performed in triplicates.

shown). data are means ± sem of three determinations.

since egb761® consists of many different constituents, we
investigated if ne- and 5-ht-inhibition could be attributed to one
or more of the known pharmacologically active compounds, i.e.
ginkgolides a, b, c and j, bilobalide or the ﬂavonoid fraction. as
depicted in fig. 5, all of the before mentioned compounds signiﬁcantly inhibited 5-ht uptake at 100 ␮g/ml, but none of them was
signiﬁcantly active  xxxd1891xxx  ␮g/ml. at 100 ␮g/ml, the ﬂavonoid fraction had the strongest effect (57% reduction), followed by ginkgolid
a (48% reduction) and bilobalide (43% reduction), the other ones
only about 25% or less (fig. 5a). ne-uptake, however, was signiﬁcantly affected only by two of the compounds tested: the ﬂavonoid
fraction, at both 100 and 10 ␮g/ml, and ginkgolid a (fig. 5b).

4. discussion

fig. 2. after 14 days of daily oral treatment with egb761® (100 mg/kg daily) does
not affect mao-a or mao-b activity compared to vehicle treated control animals.
positive control  xxxd2850xxx  (10 mg/kg for 14 days) reduced mao-b activity by 51.3%
(p < 0.05). data are means ± sem of six animals.

appeared to be higher in egb761® -treated animals compared to
control animals (20% increase 1 h after, 15% increase 4 h after treatment). however, both failed to reach the p < 0.05 signiﬁcance level
(see fig. 4a and c). positive controls for 5-ht and ne uptake were
the ssri ﬂuoxetine (10 mg/kg) and the tricyclic drug desipramine
(25 mg/kg), both showing signiﬁcant and robust ex vivo reduction
in speciﬁc synaptosomal uptake of 5-ht (fig. 4a andc) or ne
(fig. 4b and d), respectively, 1 and 4 h after treatment.
for subchronic treatment, animals received 100 mg/kg egb761®
daily for 14 consecutive days. 24 h after the last treatment speciﬁc
uptake was compared to vehicle treated control animals (fig. 4e and
f). egb761® -treatment did not affect 5-ht uptake, but ne-uptake
was reduced signiﬁcantly by 30% (p < 0.05). again, positive controls
ﬂuoxetine and desipramine were much more active.

fig. 3. egb761® inhibits uptake of dopamine (ic50 : 281 ± 148 ␮g/ml), but at
even lower concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine (97.2 ± 69 and
34.7 ± 9 ␮g/ml) in vitro. depicted are representative experiments for each neurotransmitter. ic50 data are means ± sem of six determinations using 10 different
egb761® concentrations.

the mechanisms behind cognition-enhancing effects of the
standardized g. biloba extract egb761® are not fully understood
yet. a number of animal studies points towards an increase
in monoaminergic neurotransmission [26,29,30]. earlier studies
implicated inhibition of mao as possibly involved in these effects
[25,26,30]. however, several other studies provided evidence that
mao inhibition by egb761® might not be relevant in vivo. fowler
et al. [27] showed in 10 healthy subjects receiving a commercially
available egb761® preparation for 4 weeks. using a pet detection
method for mao-a and mao-b, no signiﬁcant differences between
active treatment and placebo treated subjects were found. as the
method is speciﬁc to have a minimum sensitivity level to detect
changes of about 15%, it cannot be excluded that an even lower
level of inhibition of mao might have occurred. porsolt et al. [31]
reported possible effects of egb761® in four functional tests indicative of in vivo mao inhibition and found signiﬁcant effects only in
one of the tests for the highest concentration tested (100 mg/kg, 4
days, i.p.). he concluded that “mao inhibition was not the mechanism primarily responsible for egb761’s antistress activity”.
in the present study, we ﬁrst conﬁrmed that egb761® in vitro
preferentially inhibits mao-a over mao-b (∼10×), although at
rather high concentrations. however, egb761® did not affect ex vivo
brain mao activities after 14 days of treatment in agreement with
the studies mentioned above.
a few studies have addressed possible inﬂuences of egb761® on
monoaminergic uptake mechanisms in different experimental settings. ramassamy et al. [32,33] reported that egb761® prevents a
reduction of synaptosomal 5-ht or da uptake potentially via reactive oxygen species, which can be easily explained by the free radical
scavenging properties. in another investigation, they found that in
vitro and ex vivo egb761® enhanced 5-ht uptake at very low and
potentially therapeutically relevant concentrations [24]. in accordance with these ﬁndings, in our present study we found a similar,
however smaller and not signiﬁcant trend towards an increase of
5-ht uptake 1 and 4 h after acute application (fig. 4a and c). our in
vitro studies also conﬁrm uptake inhibitory properties for 5-ht at
higher concentrations (fig. 3), however, a in vitro uptake enhancing effects at low concentrations were not consistently seen in our
experiments (data not shown).
investigations addressing noradrenergic neurotransmission
have been performed by huguet and tarrade [34], who found that
the age-related decrease of ␣2 -binding-sites in rat cerebral cortex
was prevented by g. biloba extract treatment, indicating a relative
increase of noradrenergic neurotransmission. pointing in the same
direction, brunello et al. [29] reported a 5-fold increase of the ne
metabolite normethanephrine ( xxxd323xxx ) in the cerebral cortex of rats
after 14 days of treatment with g. biloba extract. in our study, we
show that egb761® not only inhibits ne uptake in vitro, but more
importantly that this effect can also be seen ex vivo after 14 days of
daily oral treatment using a daily dose which also has been shown

fig. 4. inﬂuence of egb761® on ex vivo uptake of 5-ht and ne. a–d show acute treatment studies, e and f results after subchronic treatment. fluoxetine reduces 5-ht uptake
by 73% 1 h after treatment (a), and by 77% 4 h after treatment (c). desipramine reduces ex vivo ne uptake by 89% 1 h after treatment (b), and by 92% 4 h after treatment (d).
after subchronic treatment with ﬂuoxetine, 5-ht uptake is decreased by 91% (e). desipramine treatment for 14 days results in no detectable speciﬁc ne uptake (f). subchronic
treatment with egb761® reduces ne uptake by 30% (f). data are means ± sem of 10 animals for vehicle control and egb761® group, and ﬁve animals for positive control
groups.

fig. 5. effects of different major compounds of egb761® on in vitro 5-ht uptake (a)

determinations.

to exhibit antidepressant effects under similar conditions [35,36].
trying to attribute these effects to a particular fraction of the standardized g. biloba extract, we were able to show that the most
promising constituents seem to be the ﬂavonoid fraction.
in line with our ﬁndings of ne uptake inhibitory properties of
egb761® not only in vitro but also in vivo are reports on antidepressant activities in preclinical tests [21]. in an investigation on
age-dependant behavioral effects, egb761® was found to reduce
immobility time in the forced swim test in 24 months old, but not
8 months old rats [35]. in another study with young rats, porsolt
et al. [36] also found no activity of egb761® in the forced swim
test paradigm. yet in the same investigation, egb761® prevented
learned helplessness, a well accepted behavioral paradigm indicative of antidepressant activity [36]. two recent reports in rats and
mice conﬁrmed the putative antidepressant properties of egb761®
in the forced swim test and the learned helplessness paradigms
[45,46]. supporting the notion of antidepressant-like properties of
egb761® are observations from clinical studies, where substantial improvement of impaired mood and depressive symptoms was
observed [37,38].
treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine that
affects ne uptake preferably over 5-ht uptake, and other inhibitors
of the ne transporter have been shown to enhance cognition in
behavioral tests, supporting the idea of a link between ne uptake

and cognition [39,40]. moreover, in the prefrontal cortex, dopaminergic synapses are different from elsewhere in the brain due to
the lack of dat for synaptic clearance of dopamine [41,42,43].
dopamine transporters are known to be rather promiscuous, for
example  xxxg2148xxx  is known to transport da with even higher afﬁnities
than ne [44]. as a result, da released in the frontal cortex also activates postsynaptic receptors of neighbored synapses until reaching
a noradrenergic nerve ending expressing  xxxg2148xxx , where it is transported across the membrane and thus cleared from a rather distant
synaptic cleft than where it was released (“volume neurotransmission”) [41]. thus, it seems quite likely that egb761® , like other
inhibitors of  xxxg2148xxx  also enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission
in the prefrontal cortex [42].
our novel ﬁndings are perfectly in line with the report by kehr
et al. [23], who showed that a similar subchronic treatment with
egb761® enhanced extracellular concentrations of dopamine and
norepinephrine but not of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex of the
rat. considering the crucial role of the prefrontal dopamine for cognitive function in general and working memory in speciﬁc [43] and
the cognition improving properties of other drugs that inhibit ne
uptake [47], this effect of egb761® very likely can contribute to its
beneﬁcial properties on attention, learning, and memory function.
taken together, our results show an additional and probably
therapeutically relevant mechanism for egb761® . by inhibition
of  xxxg2148xxx , some cognition enhancing and mood elevating effects of
egb761® are easily explainable.
