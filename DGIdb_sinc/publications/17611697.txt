raralpha is a regulatory factor for  xxxd3284xxx -induced cell growth inhibition of hematologic malignant cells.  retinoids are used for treatment of acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl).  xxxd3284xxx ,  xxxd3284xxx , binds to  xxxg1931xxx  (raralpha) more specifically than  xxxd3417xxx . we studied the tumor cell suppressive effects of  xxxd3284xxx , with respect to cytotoxicity and growth inhibition using eight myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells in culture (hl-60, hl-60r, k-562, kasumi-1, meg01, raji, u266b1, and u937). the effects of  xxxd3284xxx  were examined during 9 days of incubation with 10(-7)-10(-5) m of  xxxd3284xxx  in culture medium, which was changed every 3 days. hl-60 were the only cells sensitive to  xxxd3284xxx -induced cytotoxicity; the latter reached more than 95% after 9 days of incubation, and death was primarily through apoptosis. the total mass of raralpha in hl-60 was significantly greater (p<0.006) than in atra-resistant hl-60 (hl-60r) as well as all of other cells tested. however, in all cells excluding hl-60,  xxxd3284xxx  induced time- and dose-dependent cell growth inhibition without noticeable cytotoxicity. tgf- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  was released into the media containing cells incubated with  xxxd3284xxx  for 3 days. a dose-dependent increment of phosphorylation of smad-2 was also detected. the relative amount of secreted tgf- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  correlated with the growth inhibition rates in all cells tested excluding hl-60, and with the total mass of raralpha in the cells (p=0.0137). our results indicate that  xxxd3284xxx -induced cell-type non-specific growth inhibition is mediated by tgf- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , where the total mass of raralpha could be an important regulatory factor in hematologic malignant cells.
