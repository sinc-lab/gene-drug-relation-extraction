tolerance (11), the reduction of side effects by administration
of a pro-drug [ps-15 (12)] and the potency of this drug on the
opportunistic pathogens pneumocystis carinii (13), toxoplasma
gondii (14), and mycobacterium avium complex (15) have led
to renewed interest in its use.
in marked contrast to the clear evidence for the action of
pyrimethamine against p. falciparum dhfr, data from various studies have suggested that wr99210 might hit another
target in addition to or instead of this enzyme (16). inhibition
studies demonstrated that although wr99210 resulted in
depletion of dttp pools (consistent with inhibition of
dhfr), addition of 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (a source of
reduced folate) with drug neither restored dttp levels nor
readily attenuated the effects of wr99210, leading to the
proposal that this drug was acting on an alternative enzyme
involved in the folate synthesis and metabolism pathway (17).
in a separate study in which dhfr-deficient yeast were
transformed with different variants of p. falciparum dhfr,
relative differences in the levels of susceptibility to wr99210
were maintained between these variants in both yeast and p.
falciparum (18). however, the ic50 values of this drug were up
to 10-fold higher in the transformed yeast, leading to the
proposal that a second target present in p. falciparum had not
been brought over in the transformation (18). the possibility
of a second target has also been thought to explain the slow and
difficult appearance of resistance to wr99210 in animal
models (19) and the fact that wr99210 retains full potency on
lines resistant to pyrimethamine or cycloguanil (9, 10).
a related question has also emerged in studies of  xxxd1672xxx ,
used since the 1940s to treat falciparum and vivax malaria and
now formulated in combination with the electron transport
inhibitor  xxxd243xxx  as the new drug malarone (20).  xxxd1672xxx  is metabolized to cycloguanil in the liver principally by the
hepatic cytochrome p450 isoenzyme cyp2c19 (21). although
it is widely assumed that the effect of  xxxd1672xxx  is due solely
to activity of the cycloguanil metabolite, and several studies
argue strongly that cycloguanil acts upon dhfr (4, 5, 8), early
reports described an intrinsic activity of  xxxd1672xxx  separate
from cycloguanil, suggesting inhibition of a separate target. in
addition,  xxxd1672xxx  was found to be equally effective in vitro on
lines of p. falciparum that were either resistant or sensitive to
cycloguanil (22). when tested in humans or simian models,
 xxxd1672xxx  was found to be 2- to 4-fold more active than the
same concentration of cycloguanil (23, 24), with subsequent
studies demonstrating that this was not due to differences in
rates of metabolism, indicating that a significant part of the
antimalarial activity resided in the parent compound (25).

abstract
increasing resistance of plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites to chloroquine and the dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) inhibitors pyrimethamine and cycloguanil
have sparked renewed interest in the antimalarial drugs
wr99210 and  xxxd1672xxx , the cycloguanil precursor. to investigate suggestions that wr99210 and  xxxd1672xxx  act against a
target other than the reductase moiety of the p. falciparum
bifunctional dhfr– xxxg2366xxx  enzyme, we have
transformed p. falciparum with a variant form of human
dhfr selectable by methotrexate. human dhfr was found
to fully negate the antiparasitic effect of wr99210, thus
demonstrating that the only significant action of wr99210 is
against parasite dhfr. although the human enzyme also
resulted in greater resistance to cycloguanil, no decrease was
found in the level of susceptibility of transformed parasites to
 xxxd1672xxx , thus providing evidence of intrinsic activity of this
parent compound against a target other than dhfr. the
transformation system described here has the advantage that
p. falciparum drug-resistant lines are uniformly sensitive to
methotrexate and will complement transformation with existing pyrimethamine-resistance markers in functional studies of p. falciparum genes. this system also provides an
approach for screening and identifying novel dhfr inhibitors
that will be important in combined chemotherapeutic formulations against malaria.
the development and wide use of synthetic antimalarial drugs
in the latter half of the 20th century has been accompanied by
the rapid genesis and spread of drug-resistant strains of the
deadliest of human malaria species, the apicomplexan protozoan plasmodium falciparum. among the most serious losses
are chloroquine and the  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr, ec
1.5.1.3) inhibitors pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, the latter
being the active metabolite of  xxxd1672xxx . dhfr catalyzes the
nadph-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor in de novo nucleotide synthesis. in
the case of the dhfr inhibitors, several point mutations in the
reductase moiety of the bifunctional p. falciparum dhfr–
 xxxg2366xxx  (dhfr-ts) enzyme have been linked to
different profiles of resistance against pyrimethamine or cycloguanil (1–5). these findings have led to the suggestion that
drug-resistant strains might be countered by combinations of
alternative dhfr inhibitors (4, 6–8).
one promising antimalarial compound is the dihydrotriazine wr99210, an antifolate that has been found to be
effective against p. falciparum in vitro at exquisitely low
concentrations (in the nano- to picomolar range) (9, 10).
although early clinical trials revealed poor absorption and

the unambiguous identification and characterization of the
targets of wr99210 and  xxxd1672xxx  has important and clear
implications for the development and testing of new antimalarial drugs. to directly investigate the role of dhfr in the
action of these drugs, we have transformed p. falciparum with
a human dhfr sequence that is innately resistant to antimalarial agents and confers resistance to the folate analog
methotrexate (mtx). this report relates the findings from
these experiments and discusses their implications for drug
screening and combination chemotherapy.

materials and methods
plasmid constructs. the human dhfr gene was amplified
from a cdna clone (26) using pcr with the primers 59cctttttatgcatggttcgctaaactgcatcg and 39-aatttcaagcttaatcattcttctcatatacttc. this cdna encodes the introduced mutation
leu 3 tyr at residue 22 located within the active site (27). this
mutation greatly decreases the affinity of mtx for the apoenzyme in the presence of dihydrofolate and nadph (ki
increase of 3,200 relative to wild-type enzyme) while leading
to only minimal loss in catalytic efficiency at physiological ph
(26). the vector phd22y (see fig. 2 a) was generated by
inserting the human dhfr gene (as a nsii–hindiii fragment) in
the place of the luciferase gene in the phlh-1 construct (28).
expression occurs under the control of the flanking p. falciparum regulatory elements 59hrp3 and 39hrp2 (28).
p. falciparum transfection, selection of transformants, and
dna analysis. p. falciparum parasites (fcb strain) were
cultivated as described (29). transfection of parasites was as
previously reported (28), except for adjustments in the electroporator settings to improve the delivery of supercoiled
dna. these adjustments were made based on results from
transfection experiments with the luciferase reporter construct
phlh-1 (28). immediately after transfection, electroporated
samples were mixed with 10 ml of culture medium [rpmi 1640
with l-glutamine (catalogue no. 31800, life technologies,
gaithersburg, md), 50 mgyliter hypoxanthine (sigma), 25 mm
hepes (ultrol grade, calbiochem), 0.225% nahco3 (biofluids, rockville, md), 0.5% albumax i (life technologies), and
10 mgyml  xxxd2193xxx  (life technologies)] and grown at 37°c
in tissue culture flasks gassed with 5% co2, 5% o2, and 90%
n2. for the luciferase assays, parasites were harvested by
centrifugation 72 hr later and each culture was lysed for 5 min
at room temperature with 0.5 ml 13 pbs (ph 7.4) containing
0.15% saponin. a total of 10 ml 13 pbs was then added and
the sample spun 10 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 3 g. following removal of
the supernatant and erythrocyte ghosts, the parasite pellet was
washed once with 1.0 ml 13 pbs and transferred to a 1.5-ml
eppendorf tube. after recentrifugation (5 min at 13,000 3 g),
remaining ghosts were removed and the pellet was gently
resuspended in 50 ml 13 lysis buffer (promega). to each
luminometer cuvette was added 100 ml luciferin substrate
(promega) at room temperature. luciferase activity was measured 30–60 sec following the addition of 20 ml of parasite
lysate to the cuvette. initial experiments with low voltage, high
capacitance conditions showed high luciferase activity with
0.3–0.32 kv, 960 mf, with a steep decrease in signal at lower
voltages (data not shown). the settings 0.31 kv, 960 mf (used
with 0.2-cm cuvettes) were subsequently chosen for comparison with the previous values of 2.5 kv, 25 mf (ref. 28;
employing 0.4-cm cuvettes). the same cell numbers and dna
quantities were transfected in the 0.4-cm cuvette (one sample)
and 0.2-cm cuvettes (two transfections of half the sample
each). the low voltage, high capacitance setting was found to
increase expression signals in transfected parasites by 4- to
10-fold (table 1).
p. falciparum genomic dna was prepared from 25–100 ml
of culture at $5% schizonts as described (30). rescue of
plasmids into escherichia coli was performed by electroporat-

cells (stratagene) and plating out on luria–bertani broth plus
100 mgyml ampicillin. for southern hybridization analysis,
plasmid and p. falciparum genomic dna were digested to
completion and 2 mg and 0.2 ng, respectively, were loaded onto

to x-ray film (kodak bio-max) for 30 min at 270°c.
drug response assays. mtx (tissue culture grade) was
purchased from sigma. wr99210 [ xxxd720xxx  (31)],  xxxd1672xxx 
( xxxd1672xxx ), and cycloguanil were obtained from w.
milhous and d. kyle (walter reed army institute of research, washington, dc). all drugs were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide at 5–10 mgyml and stored at 280°c. working
solutions (made in complete medium) were kept at 4°c and
renewed every week. drug susceptibilities were determined by
the method of thaithong and beale (32). parasites were
cultured at a starting parasitemia of 0.2–0.4% in 96-well tissue
culture plates and exposed to drug for 72 hr, with one change
of medium at 48 hr. giemsa-stained smears were made at the
end of the 72-hr incubation. parasitemia was calculated after
counting a total of at least 2,000 red blood cells (rbc) or, in
the case of parasitemia ,0.2%, examining 25–30 fields of
150–100 rbcyfield. percentage inhibition of growth and
inhibition constants (ic) were calculated by comparison with
parasitemia determined from $4,000 cells counted in two
control wells without drug.

results
uniform susceptibility to mtx in p. falciparum isolates
expressing known dhfr variants. to test the possible effect
of p. falciparum dhfr point mutations on susceptibility to
mtx [a powerful dhfr inhibitor (33)], we performed drug
assays on representative parasite lines chosen to cover the set
of substitutions reported at five different positions in this
enzyme (4, 5) (fig. 1a). results showed no differences in levels
of susceptibility, with 50–83% inhibition at 50 nm and 100%
inhibition at 100 nm (fig. 1b). these values were reproduced
in tests on fcr-3 and 3b-d5 whose dhfr sequences match
those of fcb and hb3, respectively (data not shown).

(28). (b) detection of phd22y dna replicated as episomes in
transfected p. falciparum. t11mtx genomic dna (prepared 2
months posttransfection) and dna from a representative plasmid
rescued from t11mtx were restricted with scai (s; which cuts once
in the vector) or scai 1 dpni (s1d; with over a dozen recognition
sites) and hybridized with a probe corresponding to the pbluescriptii
sk(1) vector backbone. although p. falciparum-replicated episomes
were resistant to dpni digestion, digestion of e. coli-replicated plasmids resulted in detection of bands of the expected sizes 2.3, 1.0, 0.7,
and 0.3 kb (the largest being fainter as the majority of this fragment
contains 59-hrp3 sequences).

electroporation of this vector into p. falciparum, the culture
was split into two lines (t11mtx and t21mtx) and mtx
(2.2 mm and 8.8 mm, respectively) was added 48 hr later.
parasites were detected by microscopy at days 16–18 and
subsequently maintained at a mtx concentration of 8.8 mm.
these high mtx levels prevented selection of nontransfected
mtx-resistant mutants. control cultures electroporated with
equivalent amounts of the control vector phrpcat (28) and
maintained under the same mtx levels for as long as 50 days
posttransfection showed no parasite growth.
plasmid rescue performed on t11mtx and t21mtx
genomic dna prepared 1 and 2 months after transfection
yielded comparable numbers of e. coli transformants (1–1.5 3
105 cfuymg of genomic dna), indicating that episomes were
maintained in the transfected cultures. restriction enzyme and
pcr analyses of a dozen plasmid clones from each rescued
sample showed no dna rearrangements compared with the
pretransfection phd22y plasmid (data not shown). to demonstrate replication of the episomes by p. falciparum, we
employed the restriction enzyme dpni, which depends on
dna methylation for cleavage and therefore cuts dna replicated by e. coli but not by p. falciparum (34). results showed
lack of dpni cleavage of plasmid sequences present in the
t11mtx parasite genomic dna preparation, whereas this

enzyme produced multiple fragments from e. coli-replicated
phd22y dna, indicating that the transfected plasmid dna
had been replicating episomally in p. falciparum (fig. 2b). for
both sources of replicated dna, scai digestion alone gave the
expected size of the linearized 5.8-kb construct. identical
results were obtained with dna from the t21mtx line (data
not shown).
mtx resistance of p. falciparum transformed by phd22y.
mtx drug assays on lines t11mtx and t21mtx transformed with the phd22y plasmid showed ic90 values of 100
mm and 400 mm, over 4,000-fold higher than the control value
of 0.1 mm found for the nontransfected parental strain fcb
(fig. 3a). the killing curve for the episomally transformed
lines extended to even higher concentrations, as viable ringstage t21mtx parasites were found to grow even at 1,100
mm. to confirm that increased resistance was due to episomal
replication of the human dhfr vector, parallel tests were
conducted on the lines t1-mtx and t2-mtx, which 1 month
earlier had been split from the transformed lines and allowed
to propagate in the absence of drug. this regimen results in
loss of episomes from the parasites due to outgrowth of
daughter progeny lacking these elements (34–36). without
mtx pressure the phd22y episomes were lost and the

effect of wr99210. transfected and control parasites were
compared for their response to the experimental antimalarial
compound wr99210 (fig. 3b). this drug was found to exert
a profound effect on nontransformed parasites at 0.65 nm
(87% inhibition) and was fully effective at 2.6 nm, consistent
with values previously reported for the fcb strain (10). in
contrast, 2,660 nm was required to produce 87% and 62%
inhibition in the t11mtx and t21mtx lines containing the
phd22y episomes. even at concentrations .5,000 nm, viable
transformed parasites were detected (data not shown). full
sensitivity to wr99210 was completely restored in parasites
that had lost the episomes following removal of mtx pressure.

required for cycloguanil on the parental strain fcb closely matched
those recorded for this same strain by childs and lambros (10), though
the concentrations are 10-fold higher than those determined by
peterson et al. (4). sequencing of the dhfr loci confirmed identity
between fcb used in this study and that previously described (4).

55–71% whereas 100 mm resulted in .98% inhibition. this
finding for  xxxd1672xxx  was in marked contrast to the cycloguanil
response, which was decreased in the transformed parasites
(fig. 4b). indeed, whereas 1.6 mm of cycloguanil inhibited
77–97% of the control parasites fcb, t1-mtx, and t2-mtx,
similar inhibition (75–92%) was only seen at 25 mm in the
episomally transfected lines (t11mtx and t21mtx) and up
to 100 mm was needed to obtain full inhibition of the
t21mtx line. we can discount the possibility that the effect
of  xxxd1672xxx  was due to any conversion into the metabolite
cycloguanil as otherwise an increase in resistance to  xxxd1672xxx 
would have been observed in the transformed parasites, and
previous data has shown lack of metabolism of  xxxd1672xxx  to
cycloguanil in vitro (22). in the transformed parasites, the 20to 40-fold reduction in susceptibility to cycloguanil, compared
with the 4,000-fold reduction for mtx, is presumably explained by the presence of the paired a16v and s108t
mutations in the dhfr locus that reduce binding of cycloguanil
to the parasite enzyme (8).

discussion
in the development of antimalarial agents there have been
important and unresolved questions regarding the targets and
mechanisms of action of two compounds presumed to affect
the folate pathway. for both of these compounds, wr99210
and  xxxd1672xxx , various lines of evidence have suggested the
chemotherapeutic action was directed against one or more
targets independent of the dhfr enzyme. using the dhfr
inhibitor mtx, we have selected transformed lines of p.
falciparum in which the parasite dhfr activity is supplemented by a mtx-resistant human dhfr. transformed
parasites showed a 4,000-fold increase in resistance to both
mtx and wr99210. this result demonstrates that the action
of wr99210 must be against parasite dhfr and is consistent
with previous data indicating the excellent therapeutic window
of this drug (37). significant inhibition of a second target in p.
falciparum by wr99210 is not supported by these results.
wr99210 shows no cross-resistance with pyrimethamine or
cycloguanil (refs. 10 and 18; our unpublished results); in fact
one study reported that pyrimethamine-resistant cycloguanilsensitive parasites display collateral hypersensitivity to
wr99210 (18). in vivo studies in aotus monkeys have also
revealed that wr99210 and its pro-drug (which are rapidly
eliminated, possibly favorable for reducing selection pressure
on inducing resistance) are far more potent than  xxxd1672xxx  or
cycloguanil (12). recently, an in vitro study on alternatives to
pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine ( xxxd3051xxx ; hoffman–la roche)
found the greatest synergistic potency with wr99210 and the
dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor dapsone, their inhibitory
concentrations being 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those
required for pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (37). the efficacy of
wr99210 against opportunistic pathogens (13–15, 40) and the
synergistic effects of combining this drug with sulfa compounds (38, 39) should help promote pharmaceutical interest
in wr99210 and may provide an effective addition to the
antimalarial pharmacopoeia.
 xxxd1672xxx  contrasts with both cycloguanil and wr99210 in
that the level of susceptibility is unaltered in human dhfrtransformed parasite lines. these results suggest that  xxxd1672xxx 
has an intrinsic activity independent of dhfr, an activity that
may be an alternative target for the development of antimalarial drugs. our data help to explain previous findings that
 xxxd1672xxx  can be equally effective on cycloguanil-resistant or
-sensitive parasites and is considerably more effective in
monkeys than the equivalent dose of cycloguanil (22, 23, 25).
watkins et al. (22), however, calculated that the concentrations
required for parasite inhibition by the parent compound
 xxxd1672xxx  exceed levels achievable by standard therapeutic
doses and thus proposed that the clinical activity of the drug
is due principally to the cycloguanil metabolite. this apparent
paradox may be resolved by the recent report that  xxxd1672xxx  is
concentrated in red blood cells (12).
an alternative explanation for the unchanged  xxxd1672xxx 
response of the transformed parasites is that the parasite and
human enzymes could be equally affected by this drug, thereby
conferring no increase in resistance from the presence of
human dhfr. we consider this unlikely because  xxxd1672xxx 
has a high therapeutic window with no serious toxicity even
after long-term prophylaxis or administration of exceedingly
high doses [up to 1,400 mg daily (41)]. indeed, studies have
shown that some individuals convert  xxxd1672xxx  to cycloguanil
very poorly (16), with one large study in tanzania revealing
that the proguanilycycloguanil ratio varied from 0.8 to 249
(42). poor metabolizers of  xxxd1672xxx  can account for up to
70% of the population in endemic areas (43). importantly,
several studies have indicated that prophylactic failure following  xxxd1672xxx  administration is no more frequent in these poor
metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers that actively convert  xxxd1672xxx  to cycloguanil (44–46). equivalent efficacy of

10935

 xxxd1672xxx  in poor versus extensive metabolizers has recently
been confirmed in a large prophylactic study in vanuatu (a.
kaneko, personal communication). these clinical data complement and strengthen our transformation results, indicating
an intrinsic activity of  xxxd1672xxx  that may act on a target
separate from dhfr.  xxxd1672xxx  in combination with new
compounds such as  xxxd243xxx  may therefore prove to be an
efficient therapeutic tool even in regions where poor metabolizers are frequent or where resistance to cycloguanil already
exists.
in apicomplexan and kinetoplastid protozoa, dhfr resides
on the same polypeptide chain as ts. these two enzymes
catalyze sequential reactions in the biosynthesis of  xxxd3365xxx .
evidence for channeling of the dihydrofolate product from the
ts moiety to dhfr (47) is thought to support the proposal
that physical association and coordinated expression of these
two enzymes conferred an evolutionary advantage resulting in
fixation of the bifunctional dhfr-ts gene (48). while such a
selection advantage may exist, our results indicate that the
noncoupled human dhfr enzyme is able to provide the
parasite with sufficient tetrahydrofolate pools at concentrations of mtx (or wr99210) that block the function of the
parasite dhfr moiety, thus showing that physical association
of these two crucial enzymes is not a necessity for the parasite.
we also note that complementation of the parasite enzyme by
the human dhfr selectable marker provides the means to
genetically manipulate parasites already resistant to pyrimethamine. given the uniform susceptibility of p. falciparum
dhfr variants to mtx, this system will be broadly applicable
to in vitro transformation of drug-resistant or -sensitive p.
falciparum.
parasites transformed with the human enzyme provide a
potentially powerful resource in the search for dhfr inhibitors that are effective against the various mutant forms of p.
falciparum dhfr. wr99210 is an example of an inhibitor that
acts with very high and comparable efficiency against known
mutant forms of the parasite enzyme while leaving the human
enzyme unaffected. numerous triazines, diaminoquinazolines,
diaminopyrimidines, and pyrrolopyrimidines have been described (49, 50) and some of these have been shown to be
effective against forms of parasite dhfr-ts expressed in e.
coli or yeast (18, 50, 51). using p. falciparum transformed with
the human enzyme will now facilitate assessment of the
relative activities of novel lead compounds against parasite and
host dhfr. such a system can be expanded to incorporate
parasites differing in their drug-resistant profiles and cloned
transformants in which the human enzyme sequence is integrated into the parasite genome.
note. since preparation of this manuscript we have identified integration of the phd22y construct into a targeted region of the parasite
genome. this removes the inherent instability of episomes in the
transformed lines and provides stable lines that will facilitate the
screening of novel dhfr inhibitors.
we are grateful to anna liu for technical help. we thank dr.
raymond blakley for the human dhfr cdna clone; dennis kyle and
wilbur milhous for the antimalarial agents; kirk deitsch and osamu
kaneko for discussions; and akira kaneko for sharing unpublished
results.
