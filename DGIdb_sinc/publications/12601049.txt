purpose. the purpose of this study was to determine whether
budesonide inhibits expression of vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) in a retinal pigment epithelial cell line (arpe-19)
and to determine whether subconjunctivally administered
budesonide nano- and microparticles sustain retinal drug levels.
methods. the effect of budesonide (100 pm to 10 ␮m) on
vegf secretion, expression of vegf mrna, and cytotoxicity
were determined in arpe-19 cells by elisa, rt-pcr, and a
cell-viability assay, respectively. to determine the involvement
of  xxxg1601xxx  in the observed effects of budesonide, secretion and mrna expression studies were also performed in the presence of a  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist
(ru486). dl-polylactide (pla) nano- and microparticles containing budesonide were prepared by a solvent evaporation
technique, and the particles were characterized for size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release. budesonide-pla nano- and microparticles were administered subconjunctivally to one eye of sprague-dawley rats and drug levels in
the retina, vitreous, lens, and cornea of both eyes were determined at the end of 1, 7, and 14 days.
results. at concentrations devoid of cytotoxicity, budesonide
inhibited vegf secretion as well as mrna expression in
arpe-19 cells in a dose-dependent manner. ru486 treatment
prevented budesonide-mediated inhibition of vegf secretion
and vegf mrna expression. budesonide-pla nano- (345 nm)
and microparticles (3.6 ␮m), with an encapsulation efficiency
of 65% and 99%, respectively, sustained budesonide release in
vitro. after subconjunctival administration, both budesonidepla nano- and microparticles produced sustained budesonide
levels in the retina and other ocular tissues.
conclusions. budesonide is capable of inhibiting vegf expression through  xxxg1601xxx  activity. subconjunctivally administered budesonide-pla nano- and microparticles
sustain retinal drug delivery. (invest ophthalmol vis sci. 2003;

onide (molecular weight [mw], 430.5; log p ⫽ 3.2), a potent
nonhalogenated corticosteroid that is currently in clinical use
for treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and ibd, has a relative
 xxxg1601xxx  affinity of 935 compared with 100 for
dexamethasone and a 200-fold higher  xxxg1601xxx 
affinity and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol.1 through its ability to inhibit the expression of several proinflammatory genes, such as interleukin
(il)-6, il-8, and  xxxg2296xxx -␣, budesonide inhibits
inflammatory symptoms such as edema and vascular hyperpermeability at nanomolar concentrations.2,3 in airway and alveolar epithelial cells, we have shown that budesonide inhibits the
expression of  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf),4 a
potent endothelial cell mitogen capable of inducing inflammatory symptoms such as vascular hyperpermeability, edema, and
angiogenesis. indeed, vegf is implicated in the pathogenesis
of inflammatory disorders such as asthma, ibd, and arthritis.5–7
in the eye, vegf has been implicated in the progression of
several vascular disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy, cystoid
macular edema, choroidal neovascularization, and macular degeneration, which affect the posterior segment of the eye and
resemble inflammatory disorders.8 –13 as a first step to determine the applicability of budesonide to these disorders, one
objective of this study was to determine the effect of budesonide on vegf expression in a cultured human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line (arpe-19). retinal pigmented epithelial (rpe) cells form the outer blood–retinal barrier and
express vegf constitutively.14 we have demonstrated the ability of arpe-19 cells to secrete vegf.15
drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye including
choroid, retina, and vitreous is a challenging task, because of
the formidable obstacle posed by the blood–retinal barrier and
the extraocular epithelia. only a minute fraction of the drug,
administered orally or by other extravascular routes (e.g., subcutaneous and intramuscular injections), reaches the target
retina, requiring large and often toxic doses for therapeutic
effectiveness.16 this challenge is further aggravated because
the drug levels must be sustained for prolonged periods at the
target site. furthermore, because budesonide undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism to the extent of 85%, use of
this drug necessitates frequent administration and/or high
doses by the oral route.17 one possible approach to improve
retinal drug delivery is to facilitate localized delivery to the
posterior segment by using injectable, sustained-release, biodegradable particulate systems.
localized drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye
can be achieved by administering drugs through the subconjunctival route,18,19 which has been in clinical use for administering anti-inflammatory agents and anesthetics intended for
ocular therapy, primarily for the anterior segment. the potential of this route for retinal delivery and the underlying mechanisms of delivery have been determined recently.20 –22 the
vitreous concentrations of 14-c mannitol are significantly
higher when the drug is administered by the subconjunctival
route, as opposed to the intracameral route,22 and the drug
levels in the contralateral eyes are much lower after subconinvestigative ophthalmology & visual science, march 2003, vol. 44, no. 3

junctival administration in one eye, indicating that the drugs
can directly diffuse across the sclera to reach the posterior
segment of the eye. the peak subretinal fluid concentrations of
dexamethasone in humans after oral (7.5 mg), peribulbar (5
mg), and subconjunctival (2.5 mg) administration were 12.3 ⫾
1.61, 82.2 ⫾ 17.6, and 359 ⫾ 82.2 ng/ml, respectively, indicating that use of the subconjunctival route delivers greater
amounts of drug to the retina.23 in addition, subconjunctivally
administered carboplatin effectively inhibits intraocular tumor
growth in a dose-dependent fashion in transgenic murine retinoblastoma models.24 besides the retinal delivery of low-molecular-weight molecules, an osmotic pump delivery system
connected to the subconjunctival space has been shown to be
useful in sustaining detectable levels of a large macromolecule
in the tissues of the posterior segment of the eye.25
a clinically applicable way to achieve sustained drug delivery is to use drug-encapsulating polymeric microparticles (1–
1000 ␮m) or nanoparticles (1–1000 nm). by controlling drug
diffusion and/or polymer degradation, these systems can prolong drug release. artificial or natural polymers that are biocompatible and biodegradable are often used for the preparation of particulate systems. such polymers include polylactide
(pla), poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (plga), acrylic polymers or
copolymers,  xxxd2289xxx  derivatives, and alginates. among
the available biodegradable polymers, the pla and plgas are
the most widely used. in vivo, the lactide-glycolide polymer
chains are hydrolyzed to form natural metabolites (lactic and
glycolic acids) that are eliminated from the body through the
kreb’s cycle. depending on their composition and molecular
weight, the poly (lactic acid) and its copolymers with glycolic
acid provide degradation rates ranging from months to years.26
thus, there is compelling evidence that sustained drug
delivery to the retina can be achieved by administering drugs
through the subconjunctival route. thus, as a second objective
of this study, we tested the hypothesis that subconjunctival
administration of budesonide-pla nano- and microparticles can
sustain budesonide delivery to the retina.

dl/g was obtained from birmingham polymers, inc. (birmingham, al).
hydroxy-propyl-␤-cyclodextrin was a gift from cerestar usa, inc.
(hammond, in). the hplc grade methylene chloride and acetonitrile
were obtained from fisher scientific (pittsburgh, pa).

cell culture
arpe-19 cells were cultured in dmem-f12 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm
l-glutamine. the medium was changed every 2 days, and all studies
were conducted with day 8 confluent cells of passages 20 to 30.

vegf secretion studies
on day 8, serum-containing medium was removed from arpe-19 cells
plated in 96-well cluster plates, fresh medium without serum was
added, and the monolayers were allowed to remain in quiescence for
12 hours. after the quiescence period, the monolayers were incubated
with budesonide (0 –10 ␮m) in the presence and absence of a  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist (ru486: 0.1, 1, and 10 ␮m) for 12
hours. at the end of 12 hours, secreted vegf in the supernatants was
quantified by an elisa method capable of detecting  xxxg1608xxx  and
vegf121 isoforms (research diagnostics inc., flanders, nj).

rt-pcr studies
using rt-pcr (promega), we determined the effect of budesonide on
vegf mrna expression in the presence and absence of ru486 (1 ␮m).
briefly, after an initial quiescence period of 12 hours in serum-free
medium, confluent arpe-19 cells were treated with budesonide (0 –10
␮m). also, budesonide’s (0.1 ␮m) effects were determined with and
without ru486 (1 ␮m). after the 12-hour treatments, a kit was used to
isolate the total rna (rna stat-60; tel-test, friendswood, tx), and the
rna (3 ␮g) was used to amplify vegf mrna as described earlier.4,27
the primers used can detect all the splice variants of vegf. the
products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, and
 xxxg1608xxx  (584 bp) and vegf121 (452 bp) mrnas were identified and
quantified using densitometric analysis (nucleovision imaging system;
nucleotech, san mateo, ca). the vegf mrna expression was normalized to the expression of 18s rrna, an internal control. rt-pcr for the
␣ and ␤ isoforms of  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) mrna expression
was performed as described previously.28 the amplified gr mrna
products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and the gr-␣ (557 bp)
and gr-␤ (294 bp) mrna were identified. the sense and antisense
primers used for performing the rt-pcr analysis are shown in table 1.

mtt assay
the effect of budesonide treatment on cytotoxicity was assessed by
colorimetric mtt assay, as described previously.27,31 the cell viability
was determined by the relative formation of formazan after budesonide
treatments when compared with the control treated with budesonidefree medium.

budesonide-pla particle formulation
polymeric-budesonide nano- and microparticles were formulated by a
solvent-evaporation method.32 briefly, budesonide and the polymer

1194

kompella et al.

were dissolved in 1 ml dichloromethane, and this solution was added
to 10 ml of an aqueous pva (2% wt/vol) solution. the resultant
mixture was sonicated for 1.5 minutes at 20 w or 5 minutes at 50 w
with a probe sonicator (misonix inc., farmingdale, ny), to obtain an
oil-and-water (o/w) emulsion for microparticle and nanoparticle formulations, respectively. the o/w emulsion was immediately added
drop-wise to 125 ml of an aqueous pva (2% wt/vol) solution. the
contents were stirred overnight at room temperature to evaporate the
methylene chloride, allowing the formation of a turbid particulate
suspension. the nano- and microparticles were separated by ultracentrifugation (35,000g for 1 hour) and centrifugation (1000g for 30
minutes), respectively. the pellets were washed two times, resuspended in deionized water, and freeze dried to obtain lyophilized
particles.

electron microscopy of budesonide-pla particles
nanoparticles. transmission electron microscope (tem) was
used to analyze the morphology of budesonide-pla nanoparticles.
initially, carbon-coated grids were floated on a droplet of the nanoparticle suspension on a flexible plastic film (parafilm; pechiney plastic
packaging, neenah, wi), to permit the adsorption of the nanoparticles
onto the grid. after the grid was blotted with a filter paper and air dried
for 5 minutes, it was transferred onto a drop of the negative stain. after
this, the grid was blotted with a filter paper and air dried for 5 minutes.
ammonium molybdate was used as a negative stain in these experiments. finally, the samples were examined with an electron microscope set at 60 kv (em410; phillips, eindhoven, the netherlands).
microparticles. the morphology of the budesonide-pla microparticles was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (sem). briefly,
a small quantity of microparticles were layered on the sem stubs and
coated with gold palladium under an argon atmosphere using a goldsputter module in a high-vacuum evaporator. samples were then observed for their surface morphology with a scanning electron microscope set  xxxd1891xxx  kv (sem51s; phillips).

particle size and drug-loading measurement of
budesonide-pla particles
size. the particle size of budesonide-pla nano- and microparticles
was determined with a particle-size analyzer (brookhaven instruments
corp., holtsville, ny). briefly, a 0.5-mg sample of polymeric-budesonide particles was suspended in 5 ml of distilled water, and the
diluted suspension was then subjected to particle size measurement.
drug loading. the loading efficiency of budesonide in the
polymeric particles was determined by extracting and quantifying the
encapsulated budesonide. briefly, budesonide-polymeric particles (2
mg) were placed in a glass tube, and 2 ml methylene chloride was
added and mixed thoroughly at room temperature for 16 hours. the
resultant solution was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and the
dried residue was reconstituted with 1000 ␮l acetonitrile-water mixture (70:30). this reconstituted solution was vortexed for 1 minute and
centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 minutes, and 100 ␮l of the supernatant
was injected onto the hplc column.

in vitro drug release
the in vitro release of budesonide from the pla particles was performed at 37°c with dialysis membrane bags (molecular weight cutoff:
10,000; spectrum laboratory, gardenia, ca) as described previously.33
briefly, a 0.5-ml suspension of the budesonide-pla particles containing
250 ␮g budesonide was taken into the dialysis bag, and the unit was
allowed to float in 50 ml of release medium (phosphate-buffered
saline; pbs, ph 7.4) containing 0.025% sodium azide as a preservative).
at discrete time intervals, 1 ml of the release medium was removed
and replaced with fresh release medium. the released budesonide was
analyzed by hplc assay.

subconjunctival administration
sprague-dawley rats weighing 180 to 200 g were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg). after
this, 50 or 75 ␮l of either solution (containing 10% wt/wt of hydroxypropyl-␤-cyclodextrin as a solubilizing agent) or particulate suspension
of budesonide (50 ␮g for nanoparticles and 75 ␮g for microparticles),
with pbs (ph 7.4) used as the vehicle, was injected into the subconjunctival space of one eye (ipsilateral) by 27-gauge needle. the other
eye (contralateral) served as the control. at the end of 1, 3, 7, and 14
days the animals were killed, the eyes were enucleated, frozen immediately, and stored at ⫺80°c. the frozen eyes were dissected, and the
ocular tissues including retina, vitreous, lens, and cornea were isolated
and the drug levels estimated with a hplc method described in the
next section. the animal experiments were performed in compliance
with the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and
vision research.

budesonide hplc assay
the isolated ocular tissues were homogenized in 200 ␮l of pbs buffer
(tissue tearor; fisher scientific). to the homogenate, 2.5 ␮l of a
40-␮g/ml solution of celecoxib was added as an internal standard and
mixed thoroughly. methylene chloride (2 ml) was added and mixed
thoroughly at room temperature for 5 minutes. the resultant solution
was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and the dried residue was
reconstituted with 150 ␮l acetonitrile:water (70:30) mixture. this
reconstituted solution was vortexed for 1 minute and centrifuged at
12,000g for 5 minutes, and 100 ␮l of the supernatant was injected on
to an hplc system (waters, milford, ma) equipped with a pump
(tm616; waters), a controller (600s; waters), an autoinjector
(717plus; waters), and a pda detector (996; waters). the peak areas
were integrated on computer (millennium software, ver. 2.15.01; millennium software, torrance, ca). the drugs were separated with a
25-cm long c-18 column (discovery; supelco, emeryville, ca) with a
particle diameter of 5 ␮m and a pore size of 10 nm. the mobile phase
for the assay consisted of acetonitrile and aqueous buffer mixture
(70:30 vol/vol). the buffer was 0.1% acetic acid in water at ph 3. the
aqueous samples obtained from drug loading, and in vitro release
studies were analyzed under the same hplc conditions. the limit of
detection of the hplc assay was 1 ng, and the budesonide recovery
from the tissues with the extraction procedure was more than 95%.

statistical analysis

encapsulation efficiency. budesonide encapsulation
studies indicated that the encapsulation efficiency of budesonide in the pla nano- and microparticle formulations was 65%
and 99%, respectively (table 3). the observed drug loading
was 16.25% and 8.74% wt/wt budesonide in the nano- and
microparticles, respectively.

in vitro drug release
the release of budesonide from pla nano- and microparticles
into phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) was measured in vitro at
37°c (fig. 5a). for the nanoparticles, after an initial burst
release of 25% budesonide, the drug release was sustained over
the 2-week study. the cumulative budesonide release at the
end of 2 weeks was approximately 50% of the initial drug
loading. the microparticles sustained release over the 6-week
study period and the cumulative budesonide release at the end
of 6 weeks was 23% of the initial drug loading. the microparticles were devoid of burst release. the release rates estimated
between two consecutive time points in the cumulative drug
release plots of nano- and microparticles are shown in figure 5b.

detection limits in both the solution and nanoparticle groups.

tissue levels of budesonide after budesonide-pla
microparticle administration
ocular tissue levels of budesonide were compared after a
single subconjunctival injection of either budesonide solution
(containing 75 ␮g of budesonide) or budesonide-pla microparticles (containing 75 ␮g of budesonide) at the end of days 1,
7, and 14 (fig. 6). on day 1, drug levels in the solution group
were 3.5, 5.5, 3, and 2 times higher in the retina, vitreous,
cornea, and lens, respectively, when compared with microparticle group (p ⬍ 0.05 for all tissues). on day 7, drug levels in
the microparticle group were 37, 5, 4.2, and 3.4 times higher
in the retina, vitreous, cornea, and lens, respectively, compared with the solution group (p ⬍ 0.05 for all tissues). similarly, on day 14, drug levels in the microparticle group were

discussion
elevated retinal expression of vegf, a potent 42-kda endothelium-specific angiogenic mitogen is thought to play a role in
the development of several vascular disorders of the eye, including diabetic retinopathy, cystoid macular edema, choroidal
neovascularization, and age-related macular degeneration.8 –13
therefore, retinal delivery of drugs capable of inhibiting vegf
expression is an attractive therapeutic option for alleviating
retinal vascular changes. indeed, retinal vascular changes were
inhibited by intravenously administered vegf-neutralizing soluble receptor construct (vegf trapa),34 intravitreously administered vegf-neutralizing antibody,35 and vegf-receptor chimeric proteins,36 indicating that inhibition of vegf expression
is a viable strategy to inhibit retinal vascular changes. however,

antibodies and aptamers are macromolecules and have poor
stability, limited permeability, and rapid clearance,37–39
prompting the need to identify and develop low-molecular
weight drugs that can inhibit vegf expression. to overcome
these limitations with macromolecules, we are investigating
low-molecular-weight drugs capable of inhibiting vegf expression4,15 (ayalasomayajula sp, kompella ub, arvo abstract
1314, 2002).
in this study, budesonide inhibited vegf protein secretion
and vegf mrna expression in arpe-19 cells (fig. 1), an effect
likely to facilitate its application as a new agent capable of
inhibiting retinal vegf expression. we observed an intense
band corresponding to gr-␣ mrna in arpe-19 cells (fig. 2a).
budesonide inhibited vegf secretion by its glucocorticoid
receptor activity, as indicated by the prevention of budesonidemediated inhibition of vegf secretion upon cotreatment with
ru486, a  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist (figs. 2, 3). we
obtained similar evidence in airway and alveolar epithelial
cells.4
retinal delivery of budesonide is attractive because of its
favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties. the
rank of the local-to-systemic potency ratio of various corticosteroids is: budesonide ⬎  xxxd294xxx  ⬎
 xxxd3418xxx  ⬎  xxxd2126xxx  acetate.40 also, the
plasma elimination half-life of budesonide is short (2.3
hours),41 providing lower plasma accumulation of budesonide
at steady state concentration and resulting in reduced systemic
side effects such as adrenal suppression. in the eye, posterior
subcapsular cataract has been reported in 9% of the patients
with asthma treated with corticosteroids.42 these incidents
often occur in patients previously exposed to oral corticosteroid therapy. however, in the case of budesonide, after a mean
dose of 0.75 mg/d for a mean duration of 5 years in 95 patients,
no posterior subcapsular cataracts were observed.43 although,
some corticosteroids including dexamethasone have been
shown to cause ocular hypertension after either systemic,
topical, or inhalation administration, no association was found
between prolonged use of budesonide (nasal or inhalation
modes of delivery) and ocular hypertension or open-angle
glaucoma.44 thus, the very high local-to-systemic activity ratio,
low plasma half-life, and absence of reported ocular toxicity of
budesonide in conjunction with its clinical availability provide
impetus to develop budesonide for treating retinal disorders
associated with elevation of vegf.
subconjunctival administration of budesonide solution resulted in detectable drug levels in the retina and vitreous (fig.
6), suggesting the usefulness of this route to deliver drugs to
the posterior segment of the eye. we have seen detectable
drug levels only in the ipsilateral eye, and no drug was detected
in the contralateral eye, suggesting that the contribution of
systemic absorption and recirculation is minimal. similarly, lee
and robinson22 observed lower 14-c mannitol levels in the
contralateral eye than in ipsilateral eye after subconjunctival
administration. thus, budesonide entered the intraocular tissues primarily through a nonsystemic pathway, possibly by

sustained retinal delivery of budesonide

figure 6. budesonide nano- and
microparticles sustained ocular tissue levels of budesonide after subconjunctival administration in rats.
budesonide was administered in the
eyes of rats, either in the form of a
solution (50 or 75 ␮g to one eye;
small and large open circles, respectively), nanoparticles (50 ␮g to one
eye; small filled circle), or microparticles (75 ␮g to one eye; large filled
circle), and drug levels were estimated in (a) retina, (b) vitreous, (c)
cornea, and (d) lens. data are expressed as the mean ⫾ sd of results
in four experiments. data are shown
for the ipsilateral eye. drug levels
were below detection limits in the
contralateral eye. also, budesonide
levels were below detection limits
on day 14 in the solution and nanoparticle groups.

diffusion across the sclera and choroid layers. after budesonide
administration as a solution, detectable budesonide levels were
seen in most of the intraocular tissues for up to 3 days (fig. 6).
a similar dose administered intravenously disappeared completely from the blood, based on its elimination half-life of 3.4
hours in rats,41 suggesting that the drug disappears at a slower
rate from the subconjunctival space. this may be due to the
binding of highly lipophilic budesonide to the tissue matrix,
thereby sustaining the drug levels. indeed, drug binding to the
scleral extracellular matrix was proposed as a contributor to
transscleral drug delivery.18,19
because exposure to the drug in inflammatory and/or neovascular disorders is often needed for more than 3 days, development of sustained drug delivery systems for subconjunctival
administration are desirable. to this end, there is growing
interest in developing various sustained-release formulations,
including gels, microparticles, nanoparticles, and liposomes.
simpson et al.45 recently demonstrated that a subconjunctivally
injected fibrin sealant formulation can sustain retinal drug
delivery. in the current study, we used injectable, sustainedrelease, biodegradable particulate systems for sustaining budesonide delivery. although intravitreously administered microparticle systems sustained vitreous drug levels,46 the
suspended particles in the vitreous increase polymeric burden
in the eye and are likely to interfere with vision. therefore, we
administered budesonide particles by the subconjunctival
route, which is less invasive to the eye than the intravitreous,
subretinal, and subtenon modes of drug administration.
in this study, budesonide was encapsulated in pla. because
of its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and formulation flexibility, pla is used in the fabrication of several fda-approved
sustained release injectable products including doxcycline hyclate ( xxxd1939xxx ; atrix pharmaceuticals, ft. collins, co),  xxxd2463xxx  ( xxxd2463xxx ; tap pharmaceuticals, deerfield,
il), and  xxxd2229xxx  acetate (zoladex; zeneca pharmaceuticals,
wilmington, de). the results of our studies indicated that the
encapsulation efficiency of budesonide particles formulated
using a solvent-evaporation technique was higher for the mi-

croparticles (99%) than the nanoparticles (65%; table 3). the
observed values for the budesonide microparticles and nanoparticles were comparable to those reported for sustainedrelease estradiol microparticles (99%)47 and sustained-release
taxol nanoparticles (50%).48 the observed encapsulations are
consistent with the previous reports that the encapsulation
efficiency of particulate systems increases with their diameter.49,50 this can be explained by the fact that an increase in
the particle diameter results in decrease in the surface area per
unit volume, thereby reducing the possibility of drug loss by
diffusion from the surface toward the continuous medium
during the particle formation. in vitro release profiles indicated
different profiles for nano- and microparticles (fig. 5). the
cumulative budesonide release from the nanoparticle formulations was higher, with an initial burst of approximately 25%,
but the microparticles exhibited no discernible burst effect and
maintained a steady release rate. the drug release rate declined
more rapidly with the nanoparticles. similarly, berkland et al.51
reported lower burst release with larger particles. one possible
reason for this difference is the decrease in surface drug due to
a decrease in the surface area with increasing particle size.
the intraocular tissue concentrations of budesonide exhibited different trends after the administration of budesonide
solution, budesonide nanoparticles, and budesonide microparticles (fig. 6). on day 1, budesonide levels in the retina,
vitreous, cornea, and lens achieved in the solution- and nanoparticle-treated groups were significantly higher than in the
microparticle-treated group. the high burst release of budesonide from nanoparticles and/or diffusion of nanoparticles
across the sclera is a likely reason for the equivalent tissue
levels compared with the solution. on day 7, the retinal,
vitreous, and corneal budesonide concentrations were significantly higher in the nanoparticles group than in the solution
group, suggesting the ability of nanoparticles to sustain tissue
drug levels. in the microparticle group, on days 7 and 14, the
retinal, vitreous, corneal, and lens levels of budesonide were
significantly higher than in the nanoparticle and solution
groups (fig. 6). this can be explained on the basis of a decline

in drug release rate from the nanoparticles below that of
microparticles on these days.
in summary, budesonide, an fda-approved corticosteroid
for inflammatory disorders, is capable of reducing vegf expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells through its  xxxg1601xxx  activity. this indicates the potential value of
budesonide for treating vascular disorders of the retina,
wherein vegf expression is elevated. sustained-release nanoand microparticles of budesonide were successfully prepared
with pla, a biodegradable polymer. these particulate systems
sustained retinal budesonide levels when compared with a
solution form in a rat model. thus, subconjunctivally administered biodegradable particulate systems were found to be useful in sustaining retinal drug delivery.
