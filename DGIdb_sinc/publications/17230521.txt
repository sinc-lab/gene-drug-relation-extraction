twist, a  xxxg1553xxx , has been
reported to be associated with development and progression of
human cancer. recently, over expression of twist is found in
cancer patients with shorter survival and poor response to chemotherapy. previously, we found that upregulation of twist was responsible for the development of acquired resistance to taxol in a
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) cell line, hne1-t3 (wang et al.,
oncogene, 2004;24:274). in this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the twist-mediated
taxol resistance. by comparison of the parental hne1 and its derivative hne1-t3 cell lines, we found that the resistance to taxol
in hne1-t3 cells was associated with suppression of taxol-induced
apoptosis evidenced by decreased expression of bak and bax and
increased  xxxg250xxx , as well as inhibition of parp and caspase cleavage and dna ladder formation. however, there was no correlation between taxol sensitivity and alterations on g2/m cell cycle
distribution, suggesting that the twist-induced taxol resistance
is mediated through protection against apoptosis but not mitotic
arrest. analysis of additional 8 npc cell lines showed that upregulation of twist was associated with resistance to microtubule
disrupting agents, especially taxol, and inactivation of twist
through small rna interference led to increased sensitivity to
taxol-induced cell death. subsequent studies also demonstrated
that the twist-mediated taxol resistance may be regulated
through its positive involvement with the akt pathway. our ﬁndings suggest an underlying molecular mechanism responsible for
the twist-mediated chemodrug resistance and suggest a target
for overcoming taxol resistance in cancer cells.

twist, a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor, was ﬁrst reported to play a key role in mesodormal, myoblast and osteoblast differentiation.1–3 mutational inactivation of
the twist gene is suggested to be responsible for the saethrechotzen syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized
by premature fusion of the cranial sutures, skull deformations,
limb abnormalities and facial dysmorphisims.4–6 recently,
twist has been suggested to play a positive role in the development and progression of human cancer. for example, over expression of twist is reported in human rhabdomyosarcoma,7 gastric
carcinoma,8 melonoma,9 breast cancer,10–13 prostate cancer14 and
glioma.15 in addition, increased twist expression levels are
associated with advance tumour stage and poor prognosis in several types of cancer.9,14–16 more recently, increased twist in
cancer cells has been shown to promote metastatic ability of breast
cancer in in vivo animal models.12,13 in osteosarcoma, upregulation of twist is found to be a predictor in patients with poor
response to chemotherapy.17 several in vitro studies also agree
with these ﬁndings. for example, exogenous twist expression in
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts promotes soft agar colony formation,7 indicating its role in malignant transformation. gene proﬁling analysis shows that upregulation of twist is associated with
malignant transformation of melanoma and t cell lymphoma.9,18
transfection of twist in human cancer cells also increases invasion and metastatic abilities through promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition.12–15 previously, we have found that twist
gene ampliﬁcation is associated with the development of acquired
resistance to an anticancer drug, taxol, and ectopic expression of
publication of the international union against cancer

twist leads to resistance to microtubule disrupting agents.19
these results strongly suggest that twist may be a potential
oncogene. although the underlying mechanisms responsible for
the positive role of twist in human cancer are not clear, several
studies suggest that the ability of twist to promote cell survival
rather than interfering with proliferation may account for its oncogenic effect. for example, the transformation effect of twist in
mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts is thought to be regulated through its
ability to inhibit arf/mdm2/p53 mediated apoptosis.7 in addition, while overexpression of twist in human breast and prostate
cancer cells promotes cell survival and invasion ability, but it did
not alter cell proliferation rate.13,14 previously, we found that the
twist-mediated acquired taxol resistance is associated with suppression of bax, indicating its role as an-antiapoptotic factor in
mediating chemodrug resistance.19 the aim of this study was to
continue our previous investigation to establish the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the twist-induced taxol resistance,
and to explore the possibility of using twist as a therapeutic target to overcome taxol resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(npc) cells. using the 2 previously established cell lines, hne1
and hne1-t3, we found that the twist-mediated taxol resistance was mediated through its protection against apoptosis but not
its effect on mitosis. we also observed a positive association
between twist and akt phosphorylation in hne1-t3 cells, suggesting that the twist-mediated taxol resistance may be regulated through the akt pathway. studies on additional 8 npc cell
lines and small rna interference experiments demonstrated that
upregulation of twist may be a predictor for taxol resistance
and downregulation of twist may be a therapeutic target to
overcome taxol resistance in cancer cells.

brieﬂy, cells (5 3 105) were plated in 5% fcs culture medium and
different concentrations of taxol were added for indicated time
points. both ﬂoating and attached cells were collected and ﬁxed in
ice-cold 70% ethanol. the cells were then washed with pbs and
incubated with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (50 lg/ml) and rnase (1 lg/ml)

proﬁle analyzer and analyzed using the modfit lt2.0 software
(coulter). results represented average of 3 experiments.
colony forming assay
experimental details have been described elsewhere.21 brieﬂy,
200 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates and 5 doses of
taxol or vincristine were added 24 hr later for 10 days continuously. the cells were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol and stained with 10%
(v/v) giemsa (merck, damstadit, germany). colonies consisted
of more than 50 cells were counted. two wells were used for each
dose and 2 wells treated with solvent were only used as controls.
colony forming ability after drug treatment was calculated as the
ratio between the number of colonies in the treated wells and the
untreated controls multiplied by 100. results represented the average of 3 independent experiments.

detailed experimental procedures were described previously.14
protein suspension from the whole-cell lysate (1530 lg) was
loaded onto a  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel (sdspage) for electrophoresis and then transferred to a pvdf membrane (amersham, piscataway, nj). the membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies for 12 hr at room temperature
against twist (h-81; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz,
ca),  xxxg250xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology), bax (cell signaling
technology, beverly, ma), bak (cell signaling technology),
parp(cell signaling technology), caspase-3 (cell signaling

membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody against
mouse, rabbit or goat igg accordingly and the signals were visualized using ecl plus western blotting system (amersham, piscataway, nj). relative od ratio was calculated by comparing to
actin from 3 experiments.

detailed experimental procedures were described previously.22
generation of stable si-twist transfectants
twist si-rna vector was generated using the block ittm
rnai letiviral expression system according to manufacture’s

instructions (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). brieﬂy, the primers containing the short hairpin rna sequence targeting the twist coding region was annealed and cloned into pentrtm/u6vector.
then the u6 rnai cassette in pentrtm/u6vector was transferred to plenti6/block-it-dest vector using gateway lr
clonase ii enzyme mix. the sequences of the si-twist primers
were: si-twist-forward: 50 -cac cgg aca agc tga gca

vector was generated using the same procedures as the si-rna
vector except that the short hairpin rna sequence was replaced
with nonsense sequences that are not homologous to the human
genome. the sequences of the control primers were: si-con-forward: cac cgc gta ttg cct agc att acc gaa gta

were collected 48 hr later, mixed with polybrene (6 lg/ml), and
then incubated with cne1, cne2 and hone1, cells respectively.
positive si-twist clones were then selected in blasticidin (2.5
lg/ml for cne1 and cne2, and 9 lg/ml for hone1) and stable
transfectants were isolated after 6 days drug selection. a pool of
transfectants containing >20 positive clones were isolated from
each cell line.
results
association between cellular sensitivity
and taxol-induced apoptosis
as discussed previously, twist has been suggested as an antiapoptotic factor which protects cells against apoptosis in several
cell types5,7,14 and our previous studies on these 2 lines showed
that upregulation of twist in hne1-t3 cells was associated
with increased  xxxg250xxx /bax ratio,19 indicating a possible suppression
of apoptosis pathway. to investigate if upregulation of twist in
hne1-t3 cells played a protective role against taxol-induced apoptosis, we studied the expression of  xxxg250xxx , bak, bax as well as
 xxxg341xxx  and parp. as shown in figure 1a, we found that the
increased twist expression in hne1-t3 cells was associated
with lower levels of pro-apoptotic factors, bak and bax, and
higher levels of  xxxg250xxx  compared to hne1 cells in response to
taxol (5 ng/ml; 10 ng/ml) in a time dependent manner. in addition,
there were no detectable levels of cleaved  xxxg341xxx  or parp, an
indication of activation of the apoptotic pathway, in hne1-t3
cells after exposure to taxol. in contrast, increased cleaved caspase
3 and parp was observed in a dose-dependent manner in hne1
cells. these ﬁndings indicate that the high levels of twist in
hne1-t3 may provide a protection against taxol-induced apoptosis. to further conﬁrm these results, we performed dna ladder
assay. as shown in figure 1b, while there was no evidence of
dna fragmentation in hne1-t3 cells under the conditions tested,
dna laddering was evident in hne1 cells after exposure to the
same doses of taxol (5, 10 ng/ml). these results suggest that high
levels of twist may be able to function as an anti-apoptotic factor leading to resistance to taxol.
role of akt and p38map kinases in twist-mediated
taxol resistance
several signaling pathways have been suggested to play important roles in mediating anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. for example, activation of akt is believed to protect
taxol-induced apoptosis,23 while stimulation of the p38mapk
pathway leads to increased sensitivity to taxol.24 next we investigated the involvement of akt and p38mapk in the twist-mediated taxol resistance. as shown in figure 2a, activation of p-akt
and suppression of p-p38mapk, evidenced by alterations of phosphorylated protein expression, were observed in hne1-t3 cells
compared to hne1 cells. after exposure to taxol (5, 10 ng/ml),

ml) and expression of apoptosis related proteins was examined at indicated time points. (b) evidence of dna ladder formation in hne1 and
hne1-t3 cells after exposure to same doses of taxol. note that increased twist expression in hne1-t3 cells is associated with protection
against taxol-induced apoptosis in hne1-t3 cells.

the differential p-akt and p-p38mapk expression between these
2 cell lines was more apparent in a dose dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of these 2 pathways in taxol response in
these 2 cell lines. to further conﬁrm this hypothesis, we then
treated hne1-t3 cells with 2 pi3k inhibitors,  xxxd2523xxx  (20 lm)
and  xxxd3536xxx  (100 nm) to study if suppression of pi3k/akt activity could reverse its resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis. as
shown in figure 2b, after treatment with  xxxd2523xxx , the level of
taxol-induced p-akt was decreased in the cells treated with both
taxol and  xxxd2523xxx  (lanes 4, 7) compared to the cells treated
with taxol alone (lanes 3, 6) at both time points examined. this
inhibitory effect of  xxxd2523xxx  was associated with an appearance
of cleaved-parp expression at 24 hr post-exposure time (lane 7
vs. lane 6). similar results were observed in the cells treated with
 xxxd3536xxx  (fig. 2c, lane 3 vs. lane 2). these results demonstrate that suppression of taxol-induced pi3k/akt activity led to
increased sensitivity to taxol-induced apoptosis in hne1-t3 cells.
to conﬁrm the positive role of p38mapk in taxol-induced apoptosis, we then treated hne1 cells with a p38mapk inhibitor,
 xxxd3177xxx  (20 lm). as shown in figure 2d, the  xxxd3177xxx  treatment suppressed the taxol-induced p38mapk phosphorylation
(lanes 4, 7 vs. lanes 3, 6) which was correlated with disappearance of cleaved-parp (lane 7 vs. lane 6) after exposure to taxol
for 24 hr, suggesting that inhibition of p38mapk activity is able
to confer resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis in hne1 cells. an
inactive analog of the p38mapk inhibitor, sb202474 (20 lm)

was also used to treat hne1 cells as a negative control. as shown
in figure 2e, sb202474 treatment did not inhibit p38mapk phosphorylation which was associated with increased expression of
cleaved-parp. these results implicate that akt and p38mapk
pathways may play a key role in the twist-mediated taxol resistance in these cells.
effect of taxol on cell cycle distribution in hne1
and hne1-t3 cells
it is generally believed that the antitumour effect of taxol is
mainly through its interference with microtubules which leads to
mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death.25 to investigated if upregulation of twist played a role in taxol-induced cell cycle alterations, we performed ﬂow cytomeric analysis on hne1 and hen1t3 cells. first, we treated these two cell lines with their corresponding ic50 (inhibition concentration of 50% cell survival;
ic50hne1 5 0.2 ng/ml; ic50hne1-t3 5 0.45 ng/ml) and ic90 (inhibition concentration of 90% cell survival; ic90hne1 5 2.6 ng/
ml; ic90hne1-t3 5 6.0 ng/ml) concentrations to study if same cytotoxic doses of taxol could lead to differential cell cycle distribution between these 2 cell lines. as shown in figure 3a, no g2/m
arrest was observed in either cell lines treated with 2 concentrations of taxol at 3 time points (24, 48 and 72 hr), indicating that
upregulation of twist did not play a role in cell cycle distribution in response to taxol. in fact, there was a decrease in the per-

centage of g2/m phase cells in a time dependent manner in both
cell lines which was associated with an increased g1 phase fraction. to further conﬁrm these results, we then treated these 2 cell
lines with 2 relatively high doses of taxol (5 ng/ml; 10 ng/ml) and
then studied cell cycle distribution. as shown in figure 3b, as
expected, the sensitive hne1 cells showed a high percentage of
sub-g1 phase cells, indicating large number of cells undergoing
apoptosis in a time and dose-dependent manner. on the contrary,
the percentage of sub-g1 phase cells was much lower in hne1t3 cells in response to the same doses. however, with an exception of a transient g2/m arrest in both cell lines treated with relatively high dose (10 ng/ml, 12 hr post-exposure time), we did not
observe any close association between g2/m arrest and sensitivity
to taxol in these 2 cell lines. these results suggest that the
twist-induced taxol resistance in hne1-t3 cells is not associated with taxol-induced g2/m arrest.
correlation of twist expression and cellular sensitivity to taxol
and vincristine in npc cell lines
to further conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of twist in cellular sensitivity to microtubule disrupting agents, we then examined twist
expression and cellular sensitivity to taxol and vincristine in additional 8 npc cell lines, cne1, cne2, cne3, hone1, tw01,
tw04, sune1 and  xxxg1053xxx   xxxg1233xxx   xxxg1280xxx . as shown in figure 4a, 7 out of 8 cell
lines (87.5%) expressed twist at different levels, with the highest levels in cne2, hone1 and  xxxg1053xxx   xxxg1233xxx   xxxg1280xxx  cell lines. colony forming
assay presented in figure 4b showed that the 3 cell lines with high

twist expression (solid lines) were more resistant to both anticancer drugs, especially to taxol. in contrast, the cell lines with
relatively lower twist (dotted lines) were much more sensitive
to both drugs, especially cne3 which showed undetectable levels
of twist and most sensitive to both drugs. these results suggest
that upregulation of twist is associated with resistance to microtubule disrupting agents, especially to taxol in npc cell lines.
effect of twist inactivation on taxol sensitivity in npc cells
microtubule disrupting anticancer drugs, especially taxol, are
widely used in the treatment of human cancer and development of
resistance is a frequent clinical problem. to explore the possibility
of using twist as a target to increase taxol-induced cancer cell
death, we inactivated twist in 3 npc cell lines (cne1, cne2,
hone1) through small rna interference and studied if suppression of twist could lead to increased sensitivity to taxol-induced
apoptosis. as shown in figures 5a and 5b, transfection of sitwist (si-t) in the 3 npc cell lines led to suppression of
twist expression at both mrna (fig. 5a) and protein (fig. 5b)
levels compared to the controls (si-c). mtt assay showed that
the decreased twist expression in the transfectants was associated with decreased cell viability in a dose dependent manner after
exposure to 5 concentrations of taxol for 24 hr (fig. 5c, open columns). western blotting analysis showed that inactivation of
twist in the si-twist transfectants led to suppression of p-akt
expression in all 3 cell lines compared to the control (fig. 5d, time
0 hr). after exposure to taxol (10 ng/ml), the differential p-akt

expression became more prominent which was associated with
increased cleaved-parp in the si-twist transfectants (fig. 5d).
however, we did not observe any signiﬁcant association in
p38mapk levels between the cells with high or low levels of
twist (data not shown). these results further conﬁrm the importance of akt pathway in the twist-mediated taxol resistance and
suggest that inactivation of twist may be a potential therapeutic
target in reversing taxol resistance in npc cells.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that twist acted as an anti-apoptotic factor in inducing taxol resistance in npc cells. the ﬁndings that activation of akt kinase was associated with twistmediated taxol resistance suggest that increased twist in npc
cells may be able to activate the akt pathway which in turn suppresses taxol-induced apoptosis leading to drug resistance. since
upregulation of twist has been correlated with advanced stage,
poor survival as well chemodrug resistance in cancer patients,9,14–17
our ﬁndings provide a possible underlying mechanism responsible
for its action and a therapeutic target for overcoming taxol resistance in cancer cells.
recently, twist has been reported to participate in the regulation of cell survival. for example, twist-null mice show a massive wave of apoptosis in the sites where twist is normally
expressed.2 in addition, mutations causing twist haploinsufﬁciency in human calvarial osteoblasts lead to promotion of apoptosis.5 on the other hand, ectopic twist expression is able to protect mouse ﬁbroblast cells from apoptosis.7 therefore, it has been
suggested that the anti-apoptotic role of twist in human calvarial osteoblasts, together with alterations in osteoblast proliferation
and differentiation, may play a key role in the development of
saethre-chotzen and mutational inactivation of twist may result
in osteoblast apoptosis leading to premature suture ossiﬁcation.6
although several signalling pathways such as arf/mdm2/p53,

 xxxg2296xxx  and igf have been reported to be associated with its antiapoptotic effect in osteoblasts and ﬁbroblasts,5,7,26 molecular
mechanisms responsible for its role in the development and progression of human cancer, especially chemodrug resistance, are
largely unknown. in this study, we demonstrated that high twist
expression in the resistant hne1-t3 cells was not only correlated
with suppression of taxol-induced apoptosis (fig. 1) but also associated with increased p-akt and suppression of p-p38mapk
expression (fig. 2a). in addition, the fact that treatment with
pi3k/akt inhibitors,  xxxd2523xxx  or  xxxd3536xxx , was able to promote taxol-induced apoptosis in hne1-t3 cells evidenced by the
appearance of cleaved-parp (figs. 2b and 2c), suggests that akt
activation may play a key role in the twist-mediated taxol resistance. this hypothesis was further supported by the small rna
interference studies on additional npc cell lines that downregulation of twist was associated with suppression of akt phosphorylation and increased sensitivity to taxol-induced apoptosis (fig. 5).
although results on hne1-t3 cells showed a signiﬁcance of
p38mapk suppression in the twist-mediated taxol resistance
(figs. 2a and 2c), we did not observe any close association
between p38mapk and cellular sensitivity in the si-twist transfectants (data not shown). it is possible that suppression of
p38mapk observed in hne1-t3 cells may be a speciﬁc event in
this cell line or a consequence of long term drug selection during
generation of acquired resistance. nevertheless, our results indicate that the twist-mediated drug resistance may be regulated
through its positive interaction with the akt pathway leading to
suppression of taxol-induced apoptosis in npc cells. although the
precise molecular mechanism responsible for the twist-induced
akt activation is not clear, recently, a possible link between
twist and akt pathway has been suggested. for example, akt
has been shown to interferer with p53/mdm2 pathway,27,28 which
is also a target of twist.7 in addition, it was reported that inactivation of stat3 in a breast cancer cell line, 4t1, led to downregulation of akt-phosphorylation which was associated with completely abolished twist protein expression.29 furthermore, a

cell lines.

separate study reported that another effector of stat3, c-myc,
was able to co-operate with twist to override p53-dependent apoptosis leading to malignant transformation of primary mef.30
since both stat3 and akt pathways are crucial in controlling
cell survival and protection against apoptosis in cancer cells,31 it
is highly possible that the anti-apoptotic function of twist may
be mediated through interaction with these pathways. currently,
we are in the process of conﬁrming this hypothesis.
disruption of mitosis through interfering with microtubules is
one of the main targets of taxol-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells.
it is believed that the taxol-induced mitotic arrest is a trigger for
taxol-induced cell death.25 in addition, recently, upregulation of
twist has been reported to be associated with chromosomal instability in breast cancer specimens.12 however, in the present study,
in spite of treating hne1 and hne1-t3 cell lines with different
doses but same cytotoxic effect of taxol (ic50 or ic90 concentrations), and relatively high doses (5, 10 ng/ml), we did not observe
any association between g2/m phase accumulation and taxol sensitivity in both cell lines (fig. 3). this may be due to the fact that the
mitotic checkpoint control is partially defective in hne1 cells as a
results of its relatively low expression of a key regulator, mad2.21
these results further support our previous suggestion that the

twist-mediated taxol resistance is not regulated through its interference with mitosis but its role as an anti-apoptotic factor.19
microtubule disrupting anticancer drugs have been used widely
in the treatment of many types of human cancer. however, with
initial high response rates, resistance often develops in the majority of patients with advanced disease. therefore, early identiﬁcation of potentially resistant patients may be able to facilitate clinical management of cancer patients. in this study, our ﬁndings that
high levels of twist expression were associated with resistance
to taxol and vincristine in npc cell lines (fig. 4) suggest a potential marker for identiﬁcation of patients with poor clinical
response. this hypothesis is also supported by a recent study
which reported that upregulation of twist in osteosarcoma
patients was associated with poor response to chemotherapeutic
drugs, and suggested that twist may be used as a predictor for
poor clinical response.17 since overcoming drug resistance is a
main obstacle in the successful treatment of human cancer, our
results that downregulation of twist led to increased sensitivity
to taxol-induced apoptosis and cell viability (fig. 5) provide a molecular target in reversing taxol resistance in cancer cells. in addition, as the pi3k/akt signally pathway has been considered as an
attractive target for the development of novel anticancer drugs,

zhang et al.

our results also implicate twist as an alternative target for the
akt signaling pathway.
in summary, the current study demonstrates an underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the twist-mediated chemodrug resistance as well as its role in cancer progression. our ﬁndings also suggest a potential marker for identiﬁcation of tumours
that are likely to be resistant to microtubule disrupting agents

especially taxol and provide a target for overcoming taxol resistance in cancer cells.
