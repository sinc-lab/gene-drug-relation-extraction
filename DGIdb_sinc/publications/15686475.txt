abstract
in this work, we report that the recombinant glutathione
s-transferase (gst)-human l- xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
(hgad) isoforms, 65-kda l- xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
(gad) (gst-hgad65) fusion protein or free truncated
hgad65, were activated by apocalmodulin (apocam) to an
extent of 60%. both truncated forms of  xxxg849xxx  (tgad67),
hgad67(d1–70) and hgad67(d1–90), were markedly activated by apocam to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively,
while gst-hgad67 was not significantly affected. the activation appears to be due to an increase of gad affinity for its
cofactor,  xxxd3047xxx  (plp). this conclusion is based
on the following observations. firstly, the vmax of gad was
increased when apocam was present whereas the affinity for

the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. secondly, the
affinity of gad for plp was increased in the presence of apocam. thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column
chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding
between apocam and gad. fourthly, apocam was found to be
copurified with  xxxg850xxx / xxxg849xxx  by anti- xxxg850xxx /67 immunoaffinity
column using rat brain extract. hence, it is proposed that a
conformational change is induced when apocam interacts with
 xxxg850xxx  or tgad67, resulting in an increase of gad affinity for
plp and the activation of gad. the physiological significance of
the interaction between gad and apocam is discussed.

gaba is well documented as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian cns (kravitz 1967; roberts and
kuriyama 1968; roberts 1975). alterations in the level of
gaba in the cns lead to several neuronal disorders
including huntington’s chorea (perry et al. 1973; wu et al.
1979), parkinson’s disease (soghomonian and laprade 1997)
and epilepsy (kash et al. 1997). the rate-limiting step in
gaba biosynthesis is the a-decarboxylation of glutamate by
l- xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad; ec 4.1.1.15). because
of the importance of gaba in brain function, numerous
studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms
involved in the regulation of gad at the level of gene
expression (somogyi et al. 1995), protein synthesis (rimvall
and martin 1994), interaction with cofactor,  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) (kaufman et al. 1991; martin et al. 1991a,b;
martin and rimvall 1993) and post-translational modiﬁcation
(bao et al. 1994, 1995; hsu et al. 1999; wei et al. 2004).

in addition to regulation at the level of gene expression,
protein synthesis and response to plp, the activity of gad
could be regulated by post-translational modiﬁcation, e.g.
phosphorylation. indeed, we found that soluble gad,
presumably  xxxg849xxx , is activated by dephosphorylation
mediated by a ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin,

and is inhibited by protein phosphorylation mediated by
camp-dependent  xxxg1836xxx  (bao et al. 1994, 1995).
the phosphorylation site has been identiﬁed as threonine 91
in vitro (wei et al. 2004). conversely, membrane-bound
gad, presumably  xxxg850xxx , is activated by phosphorylation.
furthermore, the activation of membrane-bound gad by
atp depends on the integrity of the electrochemical gradient
of synaptic vesicles (hsu et al. 1999). however, the identity
of the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of membrane-bound gad remains unknown (namchuk et al. 1997).
recently, it was found that recombinant human  xxxg850xxx 
(hgad65) is phosphorylated and activated by protein kinase
c e but the phosphorylation site has not yet been determined
(wei et al. 2004). another post-translational modiﬁcation is
proteolytic cleavage. it is interesting that a truncated form of
hgad65 (thgad65, molecular weight 58 kda) and two
truncated forms of hgad67 (molecular weights 59 and
57 kda, respectively) are released in addition to the fulllength hgad67 when  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)hgad67 fusion protein is cleaved by  xxxg741xxx  or trypsin
(wei et al. 2003, 2004). the thgad65 is more stable and
more active than the full-length hgad65 (wei et al. 2003,
2004). in contrast, both truncated forms of hgad67, namely
hgad67(d1–70) and hgad67(d1–90), are much less active
than the full-length hgad67 (data not published).
plant gad has been reported to be a ca2+/calmodulin
(cam)-binding protein and its activity shown to be
ca2+/ cam dependent (baum et al. 1993, 1996; snedden
et al. 1995, 1996). cam is a ubiquitous modulator of
enzymes and proteins. it can exist in a ca2+-bound or ca2+free form. the physiological role of cam is considered to
be that of a ca2+ sensor translating a transient calcium
signal into a variety of cellular processes. the binding of
ca2+ causes a conformational change in cam leading to its
interaction with and activation of its target proteins (means
1988; ikura et al. 1992; meador et al. 1992; weinstein and
mehler 1994; crivici and ikura 1995). most studies have
focused on the roles of ca2+-bound cam. however, recent
studies have shown that there are a number of proteins
regulated by cam in a ca2+-independent way, which is
apocalmodulin (apocam). examples include actin-binding
proteins (baudier et al. 1991; cheney and mooseker 1992;
espreaﬁco et al. 1992; swanljung-collins and collins 1992;
houdusse et al. 1996), cytoskeletal and membrane proteins
(cimler et al. 1985; chapman et al. 1991; weissbach et al.
1994; brill et al. 1996; slemmon et al. 1996), enzymes and
channels (cohen 1980; greenlee et al. 1982; burger et al.
1983; xie et al. 1992; ling et al. 1994; yang et al. 1994;
anagli et al. 1995; arazi et al. 1995; ruan et al. 1996;
venema et al. 1996) and receptors (tripathy et al. 1995;
patel et al. 1997). furthermore, it is suggested that the role
of apocam is as important as that of ca2+/cam (rhoads
and friedberg 1997; jurado et al. 1999). in brain, cam
constitutes 0.5% of the total protein present and about

15% of the cell’s cam is bound to membranes in a ca2+independent state (teshima and kakiuchi 1978). in rat
cerebellum, the post-synaptic membrane contains abundant
cam (lin et al. 1980).
as plant gad activity is ca2+/cam dependent and cam
is abundant in the brain, it is natural to speculate that cam
may also be involved in the regulation of brain gad. it is
interesting that hgad67 is reported to be an apocambinding protein (interpro protein archive, http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/interpro). in this communication, evidence is presented showing that apocam is involved in the regulation of
hgad activity, presumably through a direct binding
between apocam and hgad resulting in an increase of
afﬁnity for plp binding.

materials and methods
materials
puriﬁed bovine cam and anti-cam were obtained from upstate
technology (lake placid, ny, usa). luria-bertani broth,
dithiothreitol, edta, nacl, cacl2, tris, potassium phosphate
monobasic and dibasic were purchased from fisher scientiﬁc
(pittsburgh, pa, usa). trypsin, soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin
inhibitor (bowman-birk inhibitor), agarose and  xxxd2213xxx  agarose, plp, 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide, benzethonium hydroxide (hyamine base, 1 m solution in methanol), cam
agarose and egta were purchased from sigma (st louis, mo,
usa). [1-14c] xxxd2431xxx  was from dupont research productsnen (boston, ma, usa). all other chemicals were also
commercially available.
purification of recombinant human brain  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx 
recombinant human brain  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  were puriﬁed as
described previously (davis et al. 2000; wei et al. 2003). brieﬂy,
hgad was overexpressed in dh5a escherichia coli, which was
transformed with either a hgad65 or hgad67 recombinant
pgex-3x plasmid as gst fusion proteins. the lysate of bacteria
containing gst-hgad65 or gst-hgad67 was applied to a
 xxxd2213xxx -agarose afﬁnity column. gst-hgad fusion
proteins were eluted from the afﬁnity column with reduced
glutathione, followed by cleavage of the fusion proteins with
trypsin. free hgad65 and hgad67 were separated from gst
and the uncleaved gst-hgad fusion proteins using reduced
glutathione afﬁnity chromatography. for the truncated  xxxg850xxx  and
 xxxg849xxx , similar procedures were used except that dh5a was
replaced by bl21 e. coli and the pgex-3x was replaced by
pgex-6p-1. the puriﬁcation steps were as described except that
the free thgad65 and thgad67 proteins were obtained from
cleavage by prescission protease (wei et al. 2003).
preparation of apohgad65
the presence of hologad or apogad was determined by
spectrophotometry. in the presence of plp, the absorption
spectrum of hologad65 exhibits two peaks at 331 and 391 nm
in addition to the protein absorption at 280 nm. the peaks at 331
and 391 nm disappear when plp is removed from hgad65 to

form the apohgad65 as described previously (chen et al. 1998).
to form apohgad65, puriﬁed hgad65 solution was ﬁrst loaded
into a microcentrifuge ﬁlter tube, followed by repeated rinsing
with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm 2aminoethylisothiuronium bromide but no plp, ph 7.2, until the
absorption peaks of gad-bound plp were not detectable.
preparation of apohgad67 and apothgad67
apohgad67 and apothgad67 were prepared as described
previously (wei et al. 2004). brieﬂy, hgad67, hgad67(d1–70)
and hgad67(d1–90) were puriﬁed as described before, except that
plp was omitted from all the buffers. the puriﬁed protein was
further dialysed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide, ph 7.2, and
deemed as apogad.
enzyme assay
acid decarboxylase activity was assayed by a radiometric method measuring the formation of 14co2 from [1-14c]glutamic
acid as described previously (wu et al. 1986). unless indicated
otherwise, the buffer used for the enzyme activity assay was 50 mm
potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide and 0.2 mm plp, ph 7.2 (standard
gad buffer). all the reactions were initiated with the addition of
[1-14c] xxxd2431xxx  to a ﬁnal  xxxd2431xxx  concentration of 2 mm.
the total volume for each assay was 200 ll.
for analysing the response of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  to ca2+/cam
and apocam, puriﬁed gst-hgad65 and gst-hgad67 fusion
proteins or thgad67 were pre-incubated in the presence or absence
of 2 lm puriﬁed bovine cam plus 0.2 mm ca2+ (referred to as
holocam) or 2 lm cam plus 2 mm egta (referred to as apocam)
at room temperature (22c) for 30 min with continuous agitation
before the initiation of the enzyme reaction.
l-glutamic

kinetic studies
kinetic studies of hgad in the presence or absence of apocam were
conducted as described in the preceding section. brieﬂy, a constant
amount of hgad (1.45 lg or 0.125 lm as the ﬁnal concentration)
was employed, whereas apocam concentrations were varied from
8.125 nm to 1 lm. gad activity determined in the absence of
apocam under the same conditions was used as the control. the
kinetic parameter of activation of hgad by apocam was determined
by ﬁtting the data to the michaelis–menten equation.
the time-course of activation of hgad by apocam was
performed as described in the previous section, except that the
reaction was terminated at different time intervals as indicated. the
rate of activation of hgad by apocam was obtained by analysing
the data with linear regression.
the dependence of activation of hgad by apocam as a
function of substrate or plp concentrations was conducted as
described in the previous section, except that different concentrations of [1-14c]glutamate (0.2–20 mm) or plp (0.05–2.5 lm) were
used as indicated. the data were analysed using the michaelis–
menten equation.
calmodulin-agarose affinity chromatography
calmodulin-agarose afﬁnity chromatography was conducted at 4c
as described previously (chapman et al. 1991) with minor modi-

ﬁcations. brieﬂy, cam-agarose columns (0.5 ml) were ﬁrst
equilibrated with buffer a (50 mm tris, ph 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol,
2 mm edta and 2 mm egta). gst-hgad65, thgad65 and
thgad67, respectively, in buffer a were applied to the cam-agarose
column. the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer a followed
by elution with 10 ml of buffer b, which is the same as buffer a
except that it contains 8 mm cacl2 without edta/egta. a volume
of 1 ml per fraction was collected and the protein pattern of the
fractions was analysed by sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.
immunopurification of l- xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase protein
complex
all experiments were conducted at 4c. puriﬁed anti- xxxg850xxx  igg
and anti- xxxg849xxx  igg were coupled to hitrap n-hydroxysuccinimide-activated sepharose according to the manufacturer’s instructions (amersham pharmacia, piscataway, nj, usa). anti- xxxg850xxx 
igg and anti- xxxg849xxx  igg immunoafﬁnity columns were then used
for puriﬁcation of the gad-associated proteins from rat brain
extract. in a typical experiment, whole rat (sprague–dawley) brain
was homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose buffer (5–10 ml/g brain) at
4c and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to
remove nuclei and debris. the resultant supernatant liquid (s1) was
centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min and the pellet thus obtained was
gently suspended in krebs–ringer phosphate buffer (123 mm nacl,
3 mm kcl, 0.4 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm nah2po4, 0.25 mm na2hpo4
and 1 mg/ml glucose, ph 7.4) with or without 1 mm edta and
1 mm egta and referred to as crude synaptosomal fraction. the
synaptosomal fraction was further subjected to sonication for
3 · 3 s. the suspension was centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h.
the resulting supernatant liquid was collected and used as the
source of gad. the crude gad sample was ﬁrst recirculated into a
1-ml anti- xxxg850xxx  or anti- xxxg849xxx  igg immunoafﬁnity column at
4c for 8 h. the column was then washed extensively with standard
gad buffer followed by 200 mm potassium phosphate gad buffer.
the column was further eluted with 0.2 m acetic acid, ph 2.5. oneml fractions were collected and dried with a speed-vac concentrator
(savant instruments inc., farmingdale, ny, usa). the samples
were resuspended in a small volume of 5 mm potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 7.2, and dialysed extensively in the same potassium
phosphate buffer. the samples were analysed by immunoblotting
with pre-adsorbed anti- xxxg850xxx /anti- xxxg849xxx  and anti-cam (upstate
technology).

the activity of gst-hgad65 was increased by apocam
more than 60% at 2 lm (fig. 1a, column 3), whereas
ca2+/cam had no signiﬁcant effect on gst-hgad65 activity
(fig. 1a, columns 4 and 5). thgad65 was also activated by
apocam to a similar extent as gst-hgad65 (fig. 1b). in
contrast, apocam did not signiﬁcantly affect the activity of
gst-hgad67 (fig. 1c) even when the concentration of

materials and methods. gad activity was expressed as percentage of
control. (a) effect of apocam and holocam on  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)-hgad65. the activity of gst-hgad65 was assayed
under the following conditions: 1, standard gad buffer alone as control; 2, 2 mm egta; 3, 2 lm calmodulin (cam) plus 2 mm egta; 4,
2 lm cam alone; 5, 2 lm cam plus 0.2 mm ca2+. (b) effect of apocam
on gst-hgad65 fusion protein and free truncated hgad65

assayed in the presence of standard gad buffer alone, 2 mm egta or
2 lm cam plus 2 mm egta. (c) effect of apocam and holocam on
gst-hgad67. gst-hgad67 activity assays were conducted in
standard gad buffer with the presence of 2 lm cam plus 0.2 mm ca2+

was taken as 100%. (d) effect of apocam and holocam on gst free

an increase of activation to extents of 141 and 85%,
respectively, in the presence of 2 lm apocam (fig. 1d).
however, holocam at the same concentration has no
signiﬁcant effect on both thgad67 (fig. 1d).
dose-dependent activation of thgad65 and thgad67 by
apocalmodulin
the activation of thgad65 by apocam appeared to be dose
dependent and reached a maximum at 0.260 lm as shown in
fig. 2(a). as the concentration of thgad65 used was
0.125 lm and the maximal activation was reached when
0.260 lm of apocam was used, the interaction between
thgad65 and apocam might involve a molar ratio of 1 : 2
(fig. 2a). similar results were obtained for thgad67 as shown
in fig. 2(b). the value of km for apocam and the vmax for
thgad65 were calculated as 0.109 ± 0.026 lm and
374.9 ± 27.8 nmol co2 formed/min/mg protein, respectively.
similarly, a km for apocam was obtained as 0.153 ± 0.024
and 0.177 ± 0.041 lm for hgad67(d1–70) and hgad67
(d1–90), respectively. the vmax for hgad67(d1–70) and
hgad67(d1–90) was calculated to be 111.3 ± 5.8 and
100.1 ± 8.1 nmol co2 formed/min/mg protein, respectively.

apocam used was as high as 10 lm (fig. 1e). however, the
truncated forms of hgad67, hgad67(d1–70) and
hgad67(d1–90), were markedly activated as indicated by

kinetic analysis of recombinant  xxxg850xxx 
the activity of thgad65 was found to be linear for 45 min
in either the presence or absence of apocam. the initial
velocity of thgad65 was calculated as 225.8 ± 13.0 and
648.7 ± 23.5 nmol co2 formed/min/mg protein in the
absence or presence of apocam, respectively (fig. 3).
the effect of apocam on the activity of thgad65 was
conducted at different concentrations of the substrate,

and 39.8 nmol co2 formed/min/mg protein for hgad67(d1–90),

and 1117.0 ± 18.1 nmol co2 formed/min/mg protein for
thgad65 alone and thgad65 plus apocam, respectively.
the value of km for plp towards thgad65 was calculated
to be 0.73 ± 0.26 lm in the absence of apocam and
0.21 ± 0.02 lm in the presence of apocam. the value of
vmax was determined to be 36.2 ± 6.0 and 94.7 ± 3.5 nmol
co2 formed/min/mg protein for thgad65 in the absence and
presence of apocam, respectively (fig. 5).
effect of apocalmodulin on hgad67: kinetic analysis
the mechanism of the activation of hgad67 by apocam
was further studied by testing the effects of apocam on the

activity was measured at various concentrations of l-glutamate including 0.2, 0.4, 0.625, 0.8, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mm in the presence or
absence of 0.52 lm apocam as described in materials and methods.

glutamate as well as the cofactor, plp. as shown in table 1,
in the presence of apocam, the km values of glutamate for
full-length and both truncated forms were not changed
signiﬁcantly. in addition, apocam did not show any
signiﬁcant effect on the km value of plp for full-length
hgad67. however, apocam decreased the km value of
plp for thgad67 by 30–35%. the estimated vmax values for

was measured at 2 mm of l-glutamate and plp concentrations of 0.05,
0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 2.5 lm in the presence or absence of
0.52 lm apocam as described in materials and methods. the activity
of thgad65 in the presence (r) or absence (s) of apocam was
plotted as a function of plp concentrations. bars indicate the sd with
n ¼ 3.

both forms of thgad67 were increased by about 100–150%
when apocam was present, suggesting that activation of
thgad67 by apocam is probably not due to a change in the
substrate afﬁnity for the enzyme but to an increase of afﬁnity
for plp.
demonstration of direct binding between apocalmodulin

to demonstrate a direct binding between hgad and

the application of gst-hgad65, thgad65 and thgad67
samples. if there was no interaction between gad and
apocam, gad would be eluted out with the equilibrating
buffer (50 mm tris, ph 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm
edta and 2 mm egta). however, if gad did bind to
apocam but not cam then gad would be retained on the
column until the column was eluted with an excess of ca2+.
as shown in fig. 6(a–d), gst-hgad65, thgad65 and
thgad67 proteins were retained by cam-agarose in the
presence of excess edta/egta and were eluted out only
after elution with a high concentration of calcium. results
from a gad activity assay (figs 6e and f) revealed that most
of the gad activity (> 90%) was in the fractions after
calcium elution, which was compatible with the protein
pattern and conﬁrmed the results obtained from sodium
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting a direct binding of gst-hgad65, thgad65 and
thgad67 to apocam.

proteins associated with gad were isolated from synaptosome soluble extract by using an anti- xxxg850xxx /antigad67 afﬁnity column. the results from immunoblotting
assays revealed that gad samples that were prepared
either in the presence or absence of 1 mm edta/egta
and puriﬁed by anti- xxxg850xxx , as well as anti- xxxg849xxx 
immunoafﬁnity chromatography, contained cam/apocam
(figs 7a and b), suggesting that apocam was associated
with gad in synaptosome preparation. the protein proﬁle

discussion

among 40 glutamate decarboxylases of different origin
(sukhareva and mamaeva 2002), only plant gad has been
reported to be a ca2+/cam-binding protein and its activity
shown to be ca2+/cam dependent (baum et al. 1993, 1996;
snedden et al. 1995, 1996). recently, hgad67 has been
stated to be an apocam-binding protein (interpro protein
archive). in this work, we report that both gst-hgad65
fusion protein and thgad65 were activated by apocam
whereas in the  xxxg849xxx  system only thgad67 and not gstgad67 fusion protein was activated. gad is composed of
two major domains: a c-terminal domain of about 500 amino
acids and a 95–100 amino acid n-terminal domain. as both
the full-length hgad65 and thgad65 were activated by
apocam, it seems reasonable to propose that apocam
interacts with hgad65 at the c-terminal domain. the
underlying mechanism for the activation of hgad65 by
apocam might be due to a conformational change in the
plp-binding domain (amino acids 210–460) resulting in an
increase in plp binding afﬁnity and subsequent activation of
hgad. this conclusion is based on the following observations. (i) apocam increased the vmax of gad but did not
alter the afﬁnity for the substrate, glutamate (fig. 4 and
table 1). (ii) apocam increased the vmax with a concomitant
increase of afﬁnity for the cofactor, plp (fig. 5 and table 1).
(iii) the full-length  xxxg849xxx  has high afﬁnity for plp
(kaufman et al. 1991; martin et al. 1991a) and hence its
activity was not signiﬁcantly affected by apocam, whereas
tgad67, full-length  xxxg850xxx  and tgad65 had low afﬁnity for
plp and hence their activities were increased by apocam
through its effect on increasing the afﬁnity of gad for plp
(fig. 5 and table 1). (iv) a direct binding between gad and
apocam was demonstrated in cam-agarose afﬁnity chromatography (fig. 6). the molar ratio between apocam and
gad appeared to be 2 : 1 as the concentration of apocam
required for maximal activation of puriﬁed recombinant
gad was about 0.260 lm when 0.125 lm of thgad65 or
thgad67 was included (figs 2a and b).
the cofactor plp plays an important role in the regulation
of gaba biosynthesis in mammalian brain. more than half
of gad is present in its plp-free form (apoenzyme) (miller
et al. 1978; itoh and uchimura 1981) and serves as a
reservoir that can be activated by plp when additional
gaba synthesis is required.  xxxg850xxx  is present mostly as
apogad, whereas  xxxg849xxx  is present as a plp-saturated form
(holoenzyme) (kaufman et al. 1991; martin et al. 1991a;
martin and rimvall 1993). our results demonstrated that
apocam activated gad via an increase in the afﬁnity for
plp. it is conceivable that apocam could regulate gad
activity in two ways. firstly, it could directly activate gad
by converting apogad to hologad through its action in
increasing the afﬁnity of gad for plp (fig. 5 and table 1).
secondly, the binding of apocam by gad would reduce the

amount of apocam available for free ca2+ and hence the
intracellular free calcium, [ca2+]i, would be elevated. the
increase of [ca2+]i would activate calcineurin resulting in
dephosphorylation and activation of  xxxg849xxx  (bao et al.
1994, 1995; wei et al. 2004). furthermore, the increase of
[ca2+]i could also activate protein kinase c and facilitate its
translocation as, under this condition, the activity of phospholipase c would be increased, resulting in the production of
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3) and diacylglycerol, leading
to the activation of protein kinase c and its translocation
from cytosol to membrane anchored (huang and walker
2004; wei et al. 2004).
it is interesting to note that plant gad is activated by cam
but not apocam whereas hgad is activated by apocam
but not cam as reported here. for plant gad the ca2+/cambinding domain has been identiﬁed as a 26-amino acid region
at the c-terminus (amino acids 470–495) (arazi et al. 1995).
without ca2+/cam binding, plant gad is inactive. the
underlying mechanism postulated is that the cam-binding
region is involved in autoinhibition of gad like other camregulated proteins (crivici and ikura 1995; james et al.
1995) and the binding of cam induces a conformational
change resulting in the disruption of autoinhibition and the
activation of gad (snedden et al. 1996).
calmodulin is a ubiquitous modulator of enzymes and
proteins (for review see jurado et al. 1999). it can exist in a
ca2+-bound or ca2+-free form. the physiological role of cam
is considered to be a ca2+ sensor, translating a transient
calcium signal into a variety of cellular processes (weinstein
and mehler 1994). the binding of ca2+ causes a conformational change in cam leading to its interaction with and
activation of its target proteins (weinstein and mehler 1994).
although much attention has been focused on the roles of
ca2+-bound cam, there are a number of proteins regulated by
cam in a ca2+-independent way that is apocam. examples
include plant gad (o’day 2003), actin-binding proteins
(espreaﬁco et al. 1992; houdusse et al. 1996), cytoskeletal
and membrane proteins (slemmon et al. 1996), enzymes and
channels (ruan et al. 1996) and receptors (patel et al. 1997).
furthermore, it is suggested that the role of apocam is as
important as ca2+/cam in cellular function (jurado et al.
1999). in the brain, cam constitutes 0.5% of the total protein
present and about 15% of cam in the cell is bound to the
membranes in a ca2+-independent state (teshima and kakiuchi 1978). at the synapse of the rat cerebellum, the postsynaptic membrane contains abundant cam (lin et al. 1980).
currently, two types of apocam-binding motifs have
been identiﬁed, namely via an iq motif and synergistic
binding of non-contiguous sequences (jurado et al. 1999).
based on the primary structure, gad does not contain the
consensus iq amino acid sequence iqxxxrgxxxr (deﬁning for iq motif) for apocam binding. however, proteins
without this apocam binding motif have also been shown to
bind to apocam (newbell et al. 1997). our apocam

effect of apocalmodulin on human brain gad 747

titration data revealed that the km of apocam for thgad65
is 10)7 m (fig. 2). this indicates that the association between
apocam and  xxxg850xxx  is reasonably strong. furthermore, the
interaction between gst-hgad65/thgad65 as well as
thgad67 and apocam was conﬁrmed by cam-agarose
column chromatography. the binding of apocam to hgad
could induce a conformational change of hgad, resulting in
the activation of gad. in addition, apocam may also
regulate gad activity through its effect on gad phosphorylation. one of the known functions of apocam is to
bind to target proteins and alter their susceptibility to
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. as both  xxxg850xxx  and
 xxxg849xxx  are regulated through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (bao et al. 1994, 1995; hsu et al. 1999; wei et al.
2004), apocam could therefore regulate gad directly
through conformational change or indirectly through facilitation or inhibition of gad phosphorylation. this aspect of
the study is currently under investigation.
