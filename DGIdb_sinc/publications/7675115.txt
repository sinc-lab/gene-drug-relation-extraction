fi-adrenoceptor regulation and functional responses in the
guinea-pig following chronic administration of the long-acting
p2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2155xxx 

received: 5 september 1994/accepted: 18 january 1995

abstract  xxxd2155xxx  is a long acting fi2-adrenoceptor
agonist designed for the alleviation of the symptoms of
asthma. this study examined the effects of 14 day
administration of  xxxd2155xxx  (200 btg/kg/day i.p.) on
ill- and fi2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig cardiac and
lung tissue. quantitative autoradiography was used to
measure changes in receptor density and organ bath
studies determined alterations in functional response.
 xxxd2155xxx  treatment produced marked reductions
of between 43% and 77% in fi2-adrenoceptor density
in all regions of the heart (atrioventricular node, bundle
of his, right and left bundle branches, interventricular
and interatrial septa, right and left atria, ventricles and
apex) and lung (bronchial and vascular smooth muscle
and parenchyma) (p < 0.01, n = 6). fil-adrenoceptor
density remained unchanged in all cardiac and lung
regions. in functional studies (-)- xxxd2398xxx  was
4 fold less potent at causing relaxation of carbachol
(1 pm) precontracted tracheal smooth muscle (pd2:
control 8.49 + 0.03,  xxxd2155xxx  7.91 _+ 0.10, p < 0.001,
n = 4), but  xxxd2155xxx  treatment did not change the
ability of (-)- xxxd2398xxx  to elicit a maximum response. the pkb values for ici 118,551, 7.33 + 0.08 in
the control and 7.20 _ 0.01 in  xxxd2155xxx  treated animals, were between those expected for ill- and fia-adrenoceptors suggesting involvement of both subtypes
in the response. in spontaneously beating right atria
and electrically paced left atria, tissues in which responses are largely mediated by fil-adrenoceptors,
there was no significant change in responses to ( - )  xxxd2398xxx  (right atria pd2: control 8.45 _+ 0.02;  xxxd2155xxx  8.42 + 0.11; p = 0.77, n = 4) (left atria pd2:
control 8.25 + 0.03;  xxxd2155xxx  8.47 ___0.08; p = 0.09,
n = 4). in the presence of cgp 20712a (100 nm) the
pkb values did not change with  xxxd2155xxx  treatment

(left atria: control 9.59 _+ 0.12,  xxxd2155xxx  9.66 -- 0.12;
p = 0.70, n = 4) (right atria: control 8.93 ± 0.11,  xxxd2155xxx  9.11 _+ 0.07; p = 0.25, n = 4).
the doses and route of administration of  xxxd2155xxx  used in this study differs from those used
clinically. however, this study demonstrates that chronic  xxxd2155xxx  administration produces selective downregulation of fi2-adrenoceptors in the lung and heart.
the changes in the lung are accompanied by a shift to
the right in the concentration-response curve to fiagonist stimulation with no change in the maximum
response.

introduction
 xxxd2155xxx  is a selective, long-acting fi2-adrenoceptor
agonist currently utilized in the treatment of asthma. it
compares in selectivity for fi2-adrenoceptors with salbutamol and terbutaline (l6fdahl and svedmyr 1989),
but has greater potency and a longer duration of action
of up to 12 h (l6fdahl and svedmyr 1989; l6fdahl and
chung 1991).  xxxd2155xxx  is a full agonist with 200 fold
selectivity for the fi2-adrenoceptor (decker et al. 1982),
which causes a concentration-dependent relaxation of
guinea-pig lung parenchyma and trachea at a lower
concentration than  xxxd2398xxx ,  xxxd2098xxx , salbutamol
or terbutaline (ida 1976; tomioka et al. 1984).  xxxd2155xxx  provides effective prophylaxis in exerciseinduced asthma (mcalpine and thomson 1990; tsoy
et al. 1990), and because of its long duration of action is
successful in the treatment of nocturnal asthma (maesen et al. 1990b). it is generally well tolerated, although
palpitations and tremor may occur at higher doses
(kawakami 1984) and tachycardia has been observed
with higher oral doses (kawakami et al. 1983). the

577

range and incidence of adverse effects observed with
 xxxd2155xxx  are not significantly different from those of
other  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonists (faulds et al. 1991). in
clinical trials lasting up to 5 years, there has been no
report of tachyphylaxis (faulds et al. 1991). this may
be explained by the route of administration with inhalation requiring only a fraction of the oral dose (l6fdahl and chung 1991), or by a large receptor reserve in
the target tissue.
terbutaline, a/?2-adrenoceptor agonist used in the
treatment of asthma, has been shown to reduce/?-adrenoceptor density is guinea-pig gastrocnemius muscle
(predominantly/?2-adrenoceptors) without affecting/?adrenoceptors in the left ventricle (predominantly/?~adrenoceptors) (elfellah and reid 1990). the aim of this
study was to determine the effect of chronic administration of  xxxd2155xxx  on the regulation of /?~- and /?2adrenoceptors in cardiac and lung regions by quantitative autoradiography, and to determine whether any
changes have functional consequences.

lung sections were treated the same way as cardiac sections
except that  xxxd228xxx  was omitted from the incubation buffers, to
prevent  xxxd228xxx  dependent icyp binding (goldie et al. 1986c;
molenaar et al. 1992).

quantitation of autoradiographs. film images were then quantitated
on the mcid system (imaging research, ontario, canada) using
a set of 12si standards prepared in guinea-pig heart paste. the
density of ill- and fi2-adrenoceptors was determined from the extent
of inhibition of icyp binding by the fil-adrenoceptor antagonist
cgp 20712a (100 gm), which can be described by the equation
developed by neve et al. (1986) and was used later in autoradiography (murphree and saffitz 1988; molenaar et al. 1990a):
b =

+ (bmax2 xl)/(l + kd2 x [1 + i/k~2])

densitometric analysis

(1)

where b is the amount of radioligand bound, bm,~ and bronx2 are
densities of fi~- and fi2-adrenoceptors, l is the concentration of
radioligand [icyp], km and kd2 are dissociation constants of the
radioligand at ill- and fi2-adrenoceptors, kil and ki2 are dissociation constants of the competing ligand (cgp 20712a) at /~a- and
fi2-adrenoceptors and i is the concentration of the competing ligand.
in the absence of competing agents the equation is reduced to:
b

methods

(bmaxl × l)/(l + k m x [1 + l / k i l l )

=

(bmaxl

x

l)/(l + kin) + (bmax2 × l)/(l + kin)

(2)

equations 1 and 2 can be used to solve bm,~a and bm,x;. values used
for dissociation constants of icyp and cgp 20712a were obtained
from a previous autoradiographic study in guinea-pig (molenaar et
al. 1987). receptor densities were corrected for protein concentration as previously described (molenaar et al. 1990a).

preparation of cardiac sections. male guinea-pigs (400-500 g) were
treated for 2 weeks with  xxxd2155xxx  (200 lag/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle
(distilled water). animals were then killed by a blow to the head 24 h
after the last dose, the thoracic cavity exposed, and the heart and
lungs quickly removed and perfused through the aorta with equal
parts of sucrose 0.32 m and krebs buffer (composition mm; naci,
118.4; kc1, 4.7;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; cac12, 1.27; na2po4, 10.0; ph 7.4).
tissues were then lightly fixed by perfusion with the same solution
containing 0.l% formaldehyde. the heart was then dissected to
obtain the atrial and ventricular septum, containing regions of
the atrioventricular conducting system (molenaar et al. 1990a).
the lungs were cut into longitudinal strips and frozen together
with the heart in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored
at - 80 ° c. sections (10 gm) were cut on a reichert-jung cryostat
at - 22 ° c and mounted onto cleansed gelatin/chromic potassium
sulphate coated microscope slides (young and kuhar 1979).
haematoxylin and eosin staining of every tenth slide was used to
histologically identify cardiac and lung regions and to check tissue
morphology.

guinea-pigs were pretreated with  xxxd2155xxx  for 2 weeks as above,
and pretreated with reserpine (1 mg/kg i.p.) 18 h before sacrifice.
this regime does not alter agonist potency (molenaar, unpublished
observations). left and right atria and trachea were dissected and
mounted in warm krebs solution (composition ram:  xxxg2020xxx , 118.4;
kc1, 4.7; cac12, 1.9; nahco3, 25; mgso~, 1.2; glucose, 11.7;
nah2po4, 1.2; edta, 0.1;  xxxd228xxx , 0.1) maintained at 37°c
under 0.5 g tension and aerated with 95% co2 and 5% 02. left
atria were electrically paced at 2.5 hz with square-wave pulses of
1 ms duration at 1.5 times the threshold voltage using a grass sd9
stimulator. right atria were allowed to beat spontaneously. tracheal zig-zag strips were prepared as described by emmerson and
mackay (1979). isometric tension was recorded using a grass forcedisplacement transducer (ft03c) and a maclab system (analog
digital instruments).

radiolabelling (~f sections. sections fi'om control and treated ani-

atria. left and right atria were allowed to stabilize under 0.5 g

mals were preincubated in krebs buffer containing  xxxd228xxx 
(0.1 mm), phenylmethylsulphonyfluoride (pmsf 10 gm) and  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp 0.1 mm) for 30 min at 25°c to prevent
tight agonist binding (nerme et al. 1985). sections were then incubated at 25°c for 150 min in krebs buffer containing  xxxd228xxx 
(0.1 ram) and p m s f (10 ~tm), with ( )[a2si]-cyanopindolol (icyp,
50 pm) (lew and summers 1985), in the absence and presence offi2and fll-adrenoceptor selective antagonists ici 118,551 (70 nm) (bilski et al. 1983) and cgp 20712a (100 nm) (dooley et al. 1986;
molenaar and summers 1987). non-specific binding was determined
using the non-selective fl-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-propranolol
(1 gm). sections were briefly rinsed and washed in buffer (2 x 15 min
washes, 37 ° c), and dipped (2 s) in distilled water before being dried
in a cooled stream of dehumidified air. labelled sections were then
apposed to kodak (ec-1) x-ray film and kept at 4°c for 2 weeks
before being developed with kodak d-19 (17 ° c, 5 rain) and fixed
with kodak rapid fix (17 ° c, 5 rain).

tension before alpha-adrenoceptors, neuronal and extraneuronal
uptake were blocked with phenoxybenzamine (50 ~tm, 30 rain). this
was followed by 6 washes over a 30rain period. a cumulative
concentration-response curve to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  was constructed,
followed by a 30 rain wash-out and stabilization period. atria were
then incubated with the fll-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712a
(100 nm) for 70 rain and a second concentration-response curve to
( )- xxxd2398xxx  was constructed, pkb values calculated from doseratio's (dr) obtained at half maximal responses to (-)- xxxd2398xxx 
were determined for the antagonist concentration [b] from the
equation, pk~ = log (dr-1)-log [b] (furchgott 1972).

functional studies

trachea.  xxxd2914xxx  (10 gm), desipramine (1 gm), corticosterone
(100 ~tm) were added to block alpha-adrenoceptors and neuronal
and extraneuronal uptake. after 30 rain, carbachol (t ~tm) was added and allowed to equilibrate until maximum tension was reached.
a cumulative concentration-response curve to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  was

578
constructed, followed by a 30 min washout period. a series of
fll-(cgp 20712a) and  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist (ici 118,551)
concentrations (1, 10, 100 or 1000 nm) were added to the organ bath
and allowed to incubate for 70 min before carbachol (1 btm) was
added. another cumulative concentration-response curve to ( - )  xxxd2398xxx  was then constructed followed by a 30 rain washout
period before the next highest concentration of antagonist was
added and the procedure repeated so that antagonist affinities (pkb
values) could be determined.

ethanol; and the remaining drugs in distilled water. all other chemicals were of analytical grade.

results

histological identification of areas in heart and lung
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to
identify the conducting regions of the heart and regions
in the lung. the conducting regions comprised the
atrioventricular node, identified as small irregularly
arranged, spindle-like cells at the base of the interatrial
septum, and separated from the interventricular septurn by a fibrous region (fig. 1), the bundle of his which
consists of regularly arranged cells superior to the interventricular septum and separated from the interatrial septum by a fibrous region (not shown), and the
right and left bundle branches (fig. 2) which extend
down the subendocardium of the right and left sides of
the interventricular septum and at times penetrate the
myocardium. in the heart the following regions were
examined, atrioventricular node (av), bundle of his
(bh), right (rb) and left bundle (lb) branches, interventricular (ivs) and interatrial septum (ias), right
(ra) and left atria (la), ventricles (rv and lv) and
apex (ax). in the lung, the three regions identified by
light microscopy and examined were, vascular smooth
muscle (vsm), bronchial smooth muscle (bsm) and
the parenchyma (par) (figs. 3 and 4). bsm was measured at the level of the bronchioles as distinct from the
bronchus, vsm in the nearby vasculature and par

was taken as the remaining area consisting mainly of
alveoli.
effect of  xxxd2155xxx  on fi-adrenoceptor density
in the heart
in the control guinea-pigs, the av had a higher density
of fi-adrenoceptors than other regions (p < 0.05, n = 6;
fig. 1, table 1). conducting regions had a higher density of fi2-adrenoceptors than the surrounding myocardium (p < 0.05, n = 6; figs. 1 and 2, table 1).  xxxd2155xxx  treatment was associated with widespread
down-regulation of fi2-adrenoceptors in all cardiac regions (p < 0.01, n = 6), with no effect on fil-adrenoceptors (figs. 1 and 2, table 1). the fll-/fi2-adrenoceptor
ratio was also increased following  xxxd2155xxx  treatment
(p < 0.01, n = 6; table 2).
effect of  xxxd2155xxx  on fl-adrenoceptor function
in the heart
 xxxd2155xxx  treatment had no effect on responses to
(-)- xxxd2398xxx  in the electrically driven left atrium
(control p d 2 8.28 -4- 0.05;  xxxd2155xxx  p d 2 : 8.47 _ 0.08;
p = 0.09, n = 4) or in the spontaneously beating right
atrium (control p d 2 : 8.45 -}- 0.02;  xxxd2155xxx  p d 2 :
8.42 _ 0.11; p = 0.77, n = 4) (fig. 5). addition of the
fil-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712a (100nm)
caused a 94 _ 22 fold rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  in control right
atria. the pkb value for cgp 20712a was 8.93 _ 0.11
in control and 9.11 _+ 0.07 in  xxxd2155xxx  treated right
atria (p = 0.25, n = 4). in control left atria cgp
20712a (100 nm) produced a 437 _+ 112 fold rightward
shift in the concentration-response curve to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  with pkb values of 9.59 _+ 0.12 in control and
9.66 _+ 0.12 following  xxxd2155xxx  treatment (p = 0.70,
n = 4). the maximal chronotropic and inotropic effect
of (-)- xxxd2398xxx  was not altered as a result of the
widespread down-regulation of the fi2-adrenoceptors
(fig. 5).
effect of  xxxd2155xxx  on fi-adrenoceptor density
in the lung
in control guinea-pigs total fi-adrenoceptor density
was 9 to
10 fold greater in the par
(127.01 +_ 14.01fmol/mg protein) than in bsm
(14.15 _+ 1.49 fmol/mg protein) or vsm (12.09 _+ 1.48
fmol/mg protein) with fi2-adrenoceptors predominating in all regions (fig. 3; table 1). in the high power
illustration in fig. 3 the high density of fl-adrenoceptors in the parenchyma results in overexposure of the
film, with the result that changes in fi-adrenoceptor
density between control and treated animals are

difference (fig. 4). in all lung regions,  xxxd2155xxx  significantly reduced ~2-adrenoceptor density (p < 0.001,
n = 6), while /?l-adrenoceptor density remained unchanged (table 1). quantitative autoradiography revealed /~l-adrenoceptors were present in all regions.
in the control animals the /31-//~2-adrenoceptor ratio

in bsm and vsm was 27:73 and 32:68 respectively.
in  xxxd2155xxx  treated animals the /~l-//32-adrenoceptor ratio altered to 58 : 42 for both bsm and vsm (fig.

effect of fortnoterol on fi-adrenoceptor function
in the lung
functional studies in the trachea showed that  xxxd2155xxx  treatment produced a 4 fold rightward shift in
the concentration-response curve to (-)- xxxd2398xxx 
(pd2 control 8.49 _+ 0.03,  xxxd2155xxx  7.91 ___0.10,
p < 0.001, n = 4). in the trachea of control animals
(fig. 6 upper panel), (-)- xxxd2398xxx  in the presence of
increasing concentrations of the fi2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551 produced rightward shifts.  xxxd2155xxx  treatment produced similar rightward shifts,
however the response to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  alone had
moved to the right (fig. 6 lower panel). the pkb values
for ici 118,551 in control 7.33 _+ 0.08 and  xxxd2155xxx 
7.20 _+0.01 treated trachea showed no significant
change (p = 0.14, n = 4). in the presence of increasing
concentrations (up to 1 btm)of the fit-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712a, there was no significant rightward shift in the  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response
curve to both control and  xxxd2155xxx  treated animals
(fig. 7).

discussion
quantitative autoradiography was used to determine
the effects of long term treatment with  xxxd2155xxx  on
fix- and fi2-adrenoceptors in cardiac and lung tissue.
we have previously demonstrated that guinea-pig
heart contains both fix- and fi2-adrenoceptors and that
there is a higher density of fi2-adrenoceptors in the
conducting regions than in the surrounding myocardial
regions (molenaar et al. 1990a,b; kompa et al. 1992).
 xxxd2155xxx  reduced fi2-adrenoceptor density in all car-

diac regions after 2 weeks of chronic treatment, without
an effect on fil-adrenoceptor density. these changes
were reflected in functional studies in which there was
no difference in the pd2 values for (-)- xxxd2398xxx  in
guinea-pig left and right atria from  xxxd2155xxx  treated
animals. inotropic responses to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  in
guinea-pig left atria are primarily caused by activation
of fix-adrenoceptors. molenaar and summers (1987)
showed that guinea-pig left and right atria predominantly contain fll-adrenoceptors in the ratio 75:25.
despite a significant proportion of fi2-adrenoceptors,
they showed that inotropic responses to  xxxd3017xxx ,
a fla-adrenoceptor agonist, were mediated entirely
through activation of fil-adrenoceptors although
a small  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor mediated response was obtained in the right atrium. this was also seen in the
present study as shown by the greater pkb value for
cgp 20712a in the left atrium compared with the right.
 xxxd2155xxx  treatment also caused reductions in fi2adrenoceptor densities in the lung regions (vsm, bsm
and par) without affecting fix-adrenoceptors in these
regions and there was desensitization of the fi2-adrenoceptor mediated relaxant response in the trachea.
responses in the trachea were mediated largely by fi2adrenoceptors, as cgp 20712a (1 btm) did not cause
a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve
to (-)- xxxd2398xxx . however, in the presence of
low concentrations of the fi2-adrenoceptor antagonist
ici 118,551, (-)- xxxd2398xxx  can produce relaxation
by activating fil-adrenoceptors. at higher concentrations of(-)- xxxd2398xxx  in the presence of i ci 118, 551
both fix- and fi2-adrenoceptors may be involved.
the pkb value for 1ci 118,551 in trachea was
7.33 + 0.08, and lay between the affinity values in
guinea-pig left atria 6.86 _+ 0.04 (predominantly ill-)
and guinea-pig uterus 8.67 + 0.04 (predominantly fi2-)

fig. 7 effects of (-)- xxxd2398xxx  on relaxation responses in carbachol (1 lam) precontracted guinea-pig trachea in the absence ([~)
and presence of increasing concentrations of cgp 20712a 1 nm (o),
10 nm (a), 100 nm (i) and 1 ktm (o), from control (upper panel)
and formoteroi treated animals (lower panel). each response is
expressed as a percentage of the maximum response to (-)- xxxd2398xxx  and points show mean values with se from n = 4 experiments
(mcpherson et al. 1984). this is in agreement with
other reports that show both fi-adrenoceptor subtypes
mediate relaxation in guinea-pig trachea (eurchgott
et al. 1975; o'donnell and wanstall 1979; carswell and
nahorski 1983). binding studies have shown the existence of both receptor subtypes in varying proportions
(fll:fi2-adrenoceptor) between species, guinea-pig
15:85 (carswell and nahorski 1983), dog 20:80
(barnes et al. 1983) and mouse 33:67 (henry et al.
1990). in  xxxd2155xxx  treated animals the rightward shift
in the  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response curve in the
presence of increasing concentrations of ici 118,551
was diminished especially at the lower concentrations
when compared to the control, suggesting desensitization of fi2-adrenoceptors.
 xxxd2155xxx  is a long-acting high affinity agonist
that has increased lipophilicity (faulds et al. 1991), and

some of the functional data could be explained by
retention of the agonist rather than desensitization. in
an in vitro study  xxxd2155xxx  has been shown to bind to
the smooth muscle membrane adjacent to the fi-adrenoceptor (jeppsson et al. 1989). however, pharmacokinetic studies in man show that after inhalation,
the elimination half life of  xxxd2155xxx  ranges between
1.7-2.3 h (maesen et al. 1990a). although the half life in
guinea-pigs is unknown, in the current study the last
dose of  xxxd2155xxx  was given 24 h before the animals
were killed.
previous autoradiographic studies have shown
a higher density of fi-adrenoceptors localized to the
alveoli of guinea-pig lung than in other regions such as
vsm and bsm (gatto et al. 1984, 1987; engels et al.
1989). in this study the region identified as par contained primarily alveoli and had a higher density of
fi-adrenoceptors than either bsm or vsm. this is also
in agreement with findings in several other species
including rat (xue et al. 1983), rabbit (barnes et al.
1984), mouse (henry et al. 1990), pig (goldie et al.
1986a) and human (carstairs et al. 1984, 1985). the
present study also revealed the presence of fll-adrenoceptors in vsm and bsm, with the fil:fi2-adrenoceptor ratio being approximately 30:70 for both
regions.
 xxxd2155xxx  is a potent fi2-adrenoceptor agonist
with reported pd2 values of 9.29 in guinea-pig trachea
and 6.98 in atria and so is about 200 fold selective for
the fi2-adrenoceptor (decker et al. 1982). minimal cardiovascular effects have been reported, but these become more apparent when the drug is taken orally
(karwakami et al. 1983). clinical studies carried out
with  xxxd2155xxx  in asthmatics have demonstrated
a rapid onset of action and a prolonged bronchodilator
effect lasting up to 12 h with as little as 12 pg of the
inhaled drug (faulds et al. 1991). treatment of asthma
with conventional fi2-adrenoceptor agonists is not associated with the development of tolerance (svedmyr
et al. 1976; harvey and tattersfidd 1982; tashkin et al.
1982). it is also apparent that subjects taking  xxxd2155xxx  do not develop tolerance (faulds et al. 1991).
in a recent study administration of clenbuterol to
calves reduced fi-adrenoceptor density in the lung,
however camp production remained constant in the
epithelium and increased in the smooth muscle of the
trachea (roets and burvenich 1993). therefore, desensitization of fi-adrenoceptors in the trachea was not
observed suggesting that this might be a reason for the
continued effectiveness during long-term treatment of
asthmatics with fi-adrenoceptor agonists. in man it has
been shown that terbutaline treatment desensitized fi2adrenoceptor mediated effects on other tissues, reducing the  xxxd2398xxx -induced decreases in diastolic pressure and  xxxd2398xxx -induced increases in plasma
noradrenaline (brodde et al. 1992).
asthma is a disease associated with marked inflammatory changes in the submucosa of the airways

586

(dunnill 1960) and bronchial tissue from asthmatics
shows shedding of the epithelium and infiltration of
cells involved in the inflammatory response, mainly
eosinophils and lymphocytes (barnes 1989). it has been
suggested that defective/~-adrenergic function was responsible for the underlying asthma (szentivanyi 1968;
reed 1974) since/~-adrenoceptor agonists reverse bronchoconstriction in asthmatic airways. defective /~-adrenoceptor function as a cause of asthma seems unlikely since chronic blockade of/3-adrenoceptors does not
produce asthma in healthy subjects (boushey et al.
1980; tattersfield et al. 1983). although there have been
reports that severe asthma is associated with decreased
bsm /~2-adrenoceptor function (goldie et al. 1986b;
lulich et al. 1988; spina et al. 1989), studies on receptor
densities from patients with chronic obstructive lung
disease have shown reductions in/3-adrenoceptor density in the bronchiolar epithelium (raaijmakers et al.
1987). other studies, have shown increases in total
/3-adrenoceptor number (raaijmakers et al. 1985; spina
et al. 1989), thought to be partly due to the infiltration
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes containing /3-adrenoceptors (galant et al. 1978) into the lung (demonchey et al. 1985; metzger et al. 1987). whatever changes
may occur, it has been suggested that the clinical significance of /3-adrenoceptor dysfunction is small since
most asthmatics respond well to /~2-adrenoceptor
agonists (barnes 1986).
previous studies have suggested, in patients with
chronic bronchial obstruction, that /~-adrenoceptors
are subjected to agonist-induced down-regulation
(conolly et al. 1971; weber et al. 1982). although
reductions in fl-adrenoceptors are observed in lymphocytes from patients treated with fi-adrenergic bronchdilators (galant et al. 1978; brodde et al. 1985), the
relevance of this finding is still a matter of debate. in
a recent study decreases in/~-adrenoceptors in mononuclear leukocytes were not accompanied by a reduction in the number of/~-adrenoceptors in lung (b6hm
et al. 1991). the same study showed that in vitro exposure of human peripheral lung strips to terbutaline
produced a time- and concentration-dependent decrease of/~-adrenoceptors (b6hm et al. 1991).
there are differences between this study and clinical
studies where no tachphylaxis has been reported. the
dose used in this study in guinea-pigs was at least 10
times the maximum recommended daily dose of
72 ~tg/day in humans (faulds et al. 1991), in terms of
oral dose (personal communication dr g. anderson).
the possibility of a large receptor reserve in the target
tissue, as seen in the trachea, could account for the lack
of tachyphylaxis seen to most 32-adrenoceptor agonists. the frequency of use could also be a factor, since in
less severe cases of asthma /~2-adrenoceptor agonists
are used intermittently so the receptors are not continuously exposed to high concentrations of agonist
and are not desensitized.
in conclusion,  xxxd2155xxx , 200 ~tg/kg/day i.p., over

a 2 week period effectively down-regulated /32-adrenoceptors in cardiac and lung regions, with no effect
on/31-adrenoceptor numbers or responses.  xxxd2155xxx 
treatment did not decrease the maximum response mediated through /~2-adrenoceptors in trachea because
there is a receptor reserve. however in the absence of
a receptor reserve, loss of receptors would be expected
to be accompanied by a decrease in the maximum
response.
