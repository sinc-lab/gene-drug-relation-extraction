abstract
the glycine site-specific n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonist 5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (acea 1021, 4  30 mg/
kg, ip) given 30 min before dexfenfluramine (4  15 mg/kg, ip, every 2 h) was unable to prevent dexfenfluramine-induced depletion of 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) content, and 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) density. another glycine sitespecific nmda antagonist, r(+)-3-aminohydroxypyrrolidin-2-one [(r)-ha 966] (2  30 mg/kg, ip), given 30 min before dexfenfluramine
(2  10 mg/kg, ip, 2 hourly) was also unable to prevent regional depletion of 5-ht, 5-hiaa, and  xxxg2150xxx  density. however, acea 1021
(4  30 mg/kg, ip) given 30 min before (s)- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma, 4  10 mg/kg, 2 hourly, ip) attenuated the
regional depletion of dopamine (da), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), 5-ht, 5-hiaa content, and  xxxg2150xxx  density. acea 1021
combined with (s)-mdma also prevented (s)-mdma-induced hyperthermia without causing hypothermia or preventing an (s)-mdmainduced increase in locomotor activity. d 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
 xxxd2611xxx  (mdma), a chemical analogue of dexamphetamine, has been used as a
recreational drug of abuse for the last two decades with a
perception by the lay press that it is ``safe,'' although this is
changing (e.g., see time magazine, june 7). there has been
an increasing number of reports of its wide spread use
(lenton et al., 1997; webb et al., 1996). however, there has
also been an increasing number of reports involving severe
toxicity and death following its ingestion, including
abnormalities of water homeostasis (henry et al., 1998),
and renal or hepatic failure, related to hyperthermia and
dehydration (fallon et al., 1999). mdma-induced neurotoxicity in rodent studies (commins et al., 1987) and
observations that doses taken by recreational users of
mdma are comparable to those that produce nerve
damage in nonhuman primates (hatzidimitriou et al.,
1999; ricaurte et al., 1988) raised concerns about possible
long-term toxic effects in humans. most recently, mdma

has been shown to reduce the number of 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) density in humans (mccann et
al., 1998; semple et al., 1999) adding weight to the
argument that it is neurotoxic.
fenfluramine is also an analogue of dexamphetamine and
is of particular interest because it differs pharmacologically
from the large majority of amphetamines. it does not cause
psychomotor stimulation (tessel et al., 1975), or have the
abuse potential of other amphetamines. fenfluramine selectively induces a loss of 5-ht axonal markers in rats that is
evident for weeks (johnson and nichols, 1990) or even
months (kleven et al., 1988) after drug discontinuation.
these effects are unlikely to be related to the acute pharmacological effects of fenfluramine as the half-life of this
compound and its metabolites is relatively short (brownsill
et al., 1991), suggesting that fenfluramine is neurotoxic, like
mdma, regardless of the different behavioral and stimulant
effects it may cause. this neurotoxicity is determined by a
sustained decrease in the content of 5-ht, 5-hiaa (5hydroxyindoleacetic acid), and  xxxg2150xxx  density in neuronal
tissues (johnson and nichols, 1990; kleven et al., 1988).
fenfluramine can induce either hypo- or hyperthermia in
humans, rats, mice, rabbits, and chickens (clark and lipton,
1986), depending on the ambient temperature at which the

animals were dosed. for example, in an early study, fenfluramine was given to rats at 4°c, 20°c, and 37°c; at the
lower temperatures hypothermia resulted and at 37°c
hyperthermia was produced (yehuda and wurtman, 1972).
a recent study using biotelemetry has shown that fenfluramine causes hypothermia in the rat at a normal ambient
temperature of 24°c and, in contrast to mdma, neurotoxicity still occurs (malberg and seiden, 1997). this is
markedly different from other amphetamines, such as
methamphetamine (meth) and mdma, because hypothermia protects against their monoamine depleting effects
(bowyer et al., 1994; miller and o'callaghan, 1995).
earlier work established that fenfluramine does not
produce acute locomotor stimulation, unlike other meta
substituted n-ethylamphetamines, such as m-chloro-n-ethylamphetamine (tessel et al., 1975). in fact, dexfenfluramine
(even and nicolaidis, 1986) and the racemate have been
found to suppress locomotor activity in animals (callaway
et al., 1993) and produces sedation or lethargy in humans
(aulakh et al., 1988).
experiments have shown that core body temperature
effects of mdma are also dependent on ambient temperature. treatment of rats with mdma and raised ambient
temperature causes hyperthermia, while giving mdma at
a lower ambient temperature results in hypothermia (broening et al., 1995; gordon et al., 1991; malberg and
seiden, 1998). mdma administration also increases locomotor activity (gordon et al., 1991) along with signs of
sympathetic stimulation, such as mydriasis, salivation,
piloerection, and hyperthermia (frith et al., 1987; hardman
et al., 1973).
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists have been
used in experiments to prevent fenfluramine- or mdmainduced changes in the cns; it has been suggested that
nmda receptor activity may play an important role in the
consequent neurotoxicity (dragunow et al., 1991; sabol et
al., 1992). the noncompetitive channel blocking nmda
antagonist, mk-801, prevents fenfluramine from increasing
striatal  xxxg1618xxx  levels and fos expression, (guerra et al.,
1998; hanson et al., 1991), although fenfluramine-induced
decreases in 5-ht content are not prevented by mk-801
(farfel and seiden, 1995b).
mk-801 also prevents mdma-induced neurotoxicity.
however, several investigators have suggested that the
neuroprotection provided is solely dependent on the ability
of mk-801 to produce hypothermia (farfel and seiden,
1995b; miller and o'callaghan, 1994). moreover, this type
of nmda antagonist has a number of other effects, such as
increasing locomotor activity, that may not be directly
related to nmda antagonism (morrow et al., 1995).
alternative neuroprotective agents may be those acting at
the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the nmda receptor, such as r(+)-3-aminohydroxypyrrolidin-2-one [(r)-ha966] and 5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (acea
1021). glycine site-specific nmda antagonists such as (r)ha 966 have shown protective effects against the toxicity

induced by mptp and cocaine (kanthasamy et al., 1997;
matsumoto et al., 1997). they have a significantly different
spectrum of activity than noncompetitive nmda antagonists, for example, they do not possess the rewarding
properties (papp et al., 1996) or the stimulant effects
(morrow et al., 1995) of mk-801. the lack of stimulant
effects may play an important role in these studies because
amphetamine-induced hyperthermia may result from the
build up of heat following increased locomotor and consequent muscular activity (cox, 1977).
these experiments were designed to test if the glycine
site-specific nmda antagonists protect against the toxicity
induced by the stereoisomers dexfenfluramine or (s)mdma without altering locomotor activity or causing a
profound decrease in core body temperature.
2. methods
2.1. animals
male sprague ± dawley rats (35 ± 42 days old) were
obtained from the animal breeding station, university of
otago. animals were housed in pairs with plain shredded
newsprint bedding that was changed every second day. drug
administration was always carried out on the day following
bedding changes. the animal house was kept at a constant
23  1°c with a 12-h dark/light cycle. standard laboratory
food and water was constantly available to all animals. a
period of 2 days was allowed for the animals to become
accustomed to their new surroundings before surgery and all
surgical procedures allowed a 4-day recovery period before
drug administration. the university of otago animal ethics
committee approved all experiments.
2.2. drugs
(s)-mdma hcl was synthesized, and its chemical
identity and purity confirmed by 1h-nmr, melting point
analysis, and measurement of optical rotation following
standard methods (nichols et al., 1986). servier donated
dexfenfluramine hcl. cosensys of california donated
acea 1021 and tocris uk supplied (r)-ha 966.
2.3. doses and regimen
to compare the neurotoxicity produced by both (s)mdma and dexfenfluramine a four-dose regimen was
chosen for most experiments. many investigators have
previously used a four dose, 2 hourly regimen (bowyer et
al., 1994; shankaran and gudelsky, 1998). farfel and
seiden (1995a) used a 40 mg/kg total dose of mdma or
50 mg/kg of fenfluramine, split over four doses. splitting
the dose of (s)-mdma into four also decreases the risk
of causing potentially lethal hyperthermia (broening et
al., 1995).

b.r. russell, r. laverty / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 68 (2001) 565±574

(r)-ha 966 at 30 mg/kg was chosen on the basis of
earlier experiments (kanthasamy et al., 1997) that found
that a single dose provided significant protection against
mptp-induced dopaminergic damage. for this particular
experiment, it was decided to test a regimen with only two
doses of dexfenfluramine and (r)-ha 966.
acea 1021 (20 ± 30 mg/kg) effectively reduced infarct
volumes and hemiparesis without inducing catalepsy in a
model of cerebral ischaemia (warner et al., 1995). in
experiments using acea 1021, a minimal amount of
tween 20 was used to solubilise the drug in sterile saline.
the same amount of tween 20 was added to the sterile saline before being given to animals used as controls.
all other drugs were dissolved in sterile saline and given
as a dose of 1 ml/kg. doses were calculated and given as
the salt.
2.4. dissection
rats were killed by decapitation without anaesthesia 7
days after drug treatment. the brain was quickly removed
from the skull and chilled in ice-cold isotonic saline for 1 min
before the cerebellum was carefully removed and discarded.
the brain was frozen over dry ice, carefully wrapped in
aluminium foil, and stored at ÿ 80°c until dissection.
serial transverse sections of the brain were cut at ÿ 12°c
and identified using the atlas of paxinos and watson (1997).
beginning at the section corresponding with plates 7, 11,
19, 30, or 40, 12 consecutive 20-mm thick slices and a 250mm thick slice were taken. the 20-mm thick slices were
thaw-mounted on gelatin-subbed slides and fan dried at
room temperature for 1 h before being frozen at ÿ 20°c
until autoradiographic analysis. the 250-mm thick slice was
dissected while still frozen using the micropunch method of
palkovits and brownstein (1988) for hplc analysis.
2.5. hplc analysis
micropunch samples were stored in a vial containing 50
ml of ice-cold tissue buffer, capped, and immediately frozen
on dry ice. tissue buffer was composed of 0.05 m disodium
hydrogen phosphate, 0.03 m  xxxd1710xxx  monohydrate, and
15% methanol in water. samples were stored at ÿ 80°c
until required.
the hplc system used consisted of a hewlett-packard
1100 system composed of an online degasser, high-pressure
pump flow rate 0.6 ml/min, cooled autosampler 4°c,
column oven 27°c, phenomonex prodigy 150  4.6 mm 3
mm c18 column with hewlett-packard series 1100 chemstation software. the analytical detection system (ecd)
used an esa 5200 coulochem ii with a guard cell 5020 at
375 mv, conditioning cell 5021 at 350 mv, high sensitivity analytical cell 5011 set with e1 = ÿ 150 mv and e2=
+ 350 mv.
the mobile phase in this system consisted of 0.05 m
disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.03 m  xxxd1710xxx  monohy-

567

drate, 0.1 mm na2edta, 1.29 mm octanesulphonic acid in
12.5% methanol made to volume with water. hplc-grade
chemicals were used wherever possible.
samples were homogenized using a cooled ultrasonic
homogenizer. samples were then centrifuged at 4°c for 10
min (18,200  g). the supernatant was injected onto the
column by autosampler and protein content determined on
the remaining pellet.
standards for dopamine (da), dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (dopac), 5-hiaa, and 5-ht were used, n-w-5-ht
was used as an internal standard. sample monoamine and
metabolite concentrations were calculated from the percentage recovery of the internal standard and related to the
amount of protein determined in each sample.
protein was determined using a commercially supplied
bio-rad dc protein assay kit. monoamine and metabolite
concentrations are expressed as picogram/microgram of
protein and compared well with published data (colado
and green, 1994; palkovits et al., 1979) suggesting an
accurate, comparable, and reliable method for measurement.
2.6. autoradiographic analysis
an autoradiographic method was used to determine  xxxg2150xxx  density (hrdina et al., 1990). 3h-paroxetine was
chosen to label the  xxxg2150xxx  because it is a more selective
ligand than alternatives, such as imipramine (hrdina et al.,
1990), in addition to being extensively used by others in this
field, for example appel et al. (1990) and scheffel and
ricaurte (1990).
briefly, the method is as follows. for total binding, the
slides were incubated for 2 h in  xxxd3449xxx  with 120 mm
nacl, 5 mm kcl at ph 7.4 with 0.2 nm 3h-paroxetine. for
nonspecific binding alternate slides were incubated for 2 h
with 0.2 nm 3h-paroxetine and 30 mm fluoxetine in tris
buffer with 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl at ph 7.4. following
this, the slides were air-dried, then exposed to amersham
hyperfilm in cassettes at 4°c for 7 weeks. standards were
incubated in each cassette along with all samples. sample
and standard images were digitized for further analysis
using a sony dxc151-ap digital video camera controlled
by a 486 pc with scion image software and lg-3 frame
grabber card.
areas measured correspond with those dissected by
micropunch from which tissue was removed for hplc
analysis. results obtained compare well with (appel et
al., 1990; de souza and kuyatt, 1987).
2.7. radiotelemetry
a dataquest 3 automated data acquisition system
(mini-mitter, or, usa) was used. mini-mitter transmitters
model vm-fh were coated with an inert paraffin/elvax film
supplied by mini-mitter that is biocompatible and does not
cause inflammation. transmitters were surgically implanted
using aseptic techniques. transmitter calibration was checked

568

b.r. russell, r. laverty / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 68 (2001) 565±574

with a temperature controlled water bath placed over a
receiver pad.
this information was recorded and collected by an ibm
compatible 486 pc for later analysis. minimitters have a
resolution of  0.01°c (clement et al., 1989) and have been
shown to be valid and reliable (dilsaver et al., 1992) for
measuring core temperature. locomotor activity was also
measured using the same system.
2.8. statistics
all statistics for data obtained by hplc and autoradiography were carried out by graphpad prism version 2.01.
the statistical significance of differences between groups
was carried by a one-way analysis of variance (anova)
followed by a neuman ±keuls post-hoc comparison.
radiotelemetry data was analysed by spss for windows
ver. 8.0. between group comparisons were determined by
calculating the mean temperature and mean activity count
(mac) for individual animals in each group over 120 min,
then using a 2-way anova with repeated measures followed by student ±neuman± keuls post-hoc comparison.
3. results
3.1. effect of dexfenfluramine, (r)-ha 966, and acea 1021
on the regional content of 5-ht, 5-hiaa content, and  xxxg2150xxx  density and core body temperature
four doses of dexfenfluramine (15 mg/kg) induced (after
7 days) decreases in 5-ht, 5-hiaa content, and  xxxg2150xxx 
density in the sensory cortex, ca1, caudate putamen, and
hypothalamus (table 1).
basal levels in the sensory cortex of 5-ht were 3.2  0.3
pg/mg, 5-hiaa 2.7  0.2 pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx  59.1  4.7 fmol/
mg of protein. basal levels in the ca1 region of 5-ht were
8.9  0.9 pg/mg, 5-hiaa 6.5  0.6 pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx 
87.1  11.4 fmol/mg of protein. basal levels in the hypothalamus of 5-ht were 10.0  0.6 pg/mg, 5-hiaa 6.9  0.5 pg/

mg, and  xxxg2150xxx  80.7  5.1 fmol/mg of protein. basal levels
in the caudate putamen of da were 86.7  8.0 pg/mg,
dopac 10.4  1.0 pg/mg, 5-ht 7.0  0.6 pg/mg, 5-hiaa
4.7  0.2 pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx  65.6  9.1 fmol/mg of protein.
dexfenfluramine significantly decreased 5-ht basal
levels in the sensory cortex [ f(3,26) = 14.4, p < .05], ca1
[ f = 13.6, p < .05], caudate putamen [ f(3,28) = 6.0,
p < .05], and hypothalamus ( f = 5.9, p < .05), 5-hiaa basal
levels were significantly decreased in the sensory cortex
( f = 6.0, p < .05), ca1 ( f = 15.9, p < .05), caudate putamen
[ f(3,28) = 4.4, p < .05], and hypothalamus ( f = 10.0,
p < .05). the  xxxg2150xxx  density was significantly decreased
in the sensory cortex [ f(3,24) = 4.38, p < .05], ca1 [ f(3,
27) = 4.55, p < .05], and hypothalamus [ f(3,28) = 21.23,
p < .05].
acea 1021 was unable to prevent this depletion when
given 30 min before dexfenfluramine. a further experiment using the same dosing regimen was carried out
using a lower dose of dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg) in
combination with acea 1021 (4  30 mg/kg). however,
acea 1021 was still unable to prevent dexfenfluramineinduced decreases in 5-ht, 5-hiaa, and  xxxg2150xxx  density
(data not shown).
3.2. effect of dexfenfluramine and (r)-ha 966 on the
regional content of 5-ht, 5-hiaa content, and  xxxg2150xxx 
density and core body temperature
basal levels in the cingulate cortex of 5-ht were
0.9  0.1 pg/mg, 5-hiaa 0.5  0.1 pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx 
224.6  27.7 fmol/mg of protein. basal levels in the ca1
region of 5-ht were 18.9  3.0 pg/mg, 5-hiaa 18.0  2.3
pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx  194.1  33.0 fmol/mg of protein. basal
levels in the caudate putamen of da were 156.9  13.5 pg/
mg, dopac 23.4  2.8 pg/mg, 5-ht 1.7  0.4 pg/mg, 5hiaa, 2.9  0.3 pg/mg, and  xxxg2150xxx  118.1  24.1 fmol/mg
of protein.
dexfenfluramine significantly decreased 5-ht levels in
the cingulate cortex [ f(3,18) = 5.5, p < .05], caudate putamen [ f(3,19) = 5.8, p < .05], and 5-hiaa levels in the

p < .05], and caudate putamen ( f = 3.8, p < .05).
two doses of dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg) caused depletion of 5-ht and 5-hiaa and  xxxg2150xxx  density in the
cingulate cortex and caudate putamen (table 2). dexfenfluramine also appears to have decreased 5-ht content in
the ca1; although this was not statistically significant, the
decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  density suggested that damage to
serotonergic neurons did occur. (r)-ha 966 failed to
prevent depletion of 5-ht, 5-hiaa, or  xxxg2150xxx  if given
before dexfenfluramine.
there was a significant drug effect on temperature
relative to controls over the entire test period in experiments
using dexfenfluramine combined with either acea 1021
(fig. 1) [ f(3,5) = 5.1, p < .029] or (r)-ha 966 (fig. 2)
[ f(3,5) = 44.8, p < .0005]. dexfenfluramine alone caused a
significant decrease in body temperature compared to control animals beyond 180 min in both experiments
(xå = 37.0°c, p < .05, fig. 1; xå = 36.9°c p < .05, fig. 2).

in the group given (r)-ha 966 alone, no significant
change in body temperature occurred at any time point.
in contrast, the group given acea 1021 showed a significant decrease in temperature (xå = 36.3°c, p < .05)
between 180 and 300 min compared to animals given
saline only (xå = 37.8°c).
however, dexfenfluramine combined with (r)-ha 966
significantly decreased body temperature between 0 and 120
min (xå = 37.1, p < .05) that further decreased between 180
and 300 min (xå = 36.2, p < .05).
in the group given acea 1021 before dexfenfluramine,
a significant decrease in body temperature occurred that
further decreased until the period between 380 and 500 min
(xå = 35.6°c, p < .05).
body temperature slowly returned to approximately
37.8°c by 700 min in groups given either acea 1021 or
(r)-ha 966 before dexfenfluramine.
locomotor activity was monitored in both experiments, and although small significant changes were
measured in some groups, the results were not considered
biologically significant.

(s)-mdma significantly decreased da levels in the
caudate putamen [ f = (3,20) = 7.0, p < .05], 5-ht levels in
the cingulate cortex [ f(3,20) = 3.8, p < .05], caudate putamen ( f = 13.8, p < .05), ca1 ( f = 9.4, p < .05), and 5hiaa levels in the caudate putamen [ f(3,20) = 5.2,
p < .05] and the ca1 ( f = 3.6, p < .05). the  xxxg2150xxx  density
was significantly decreased in caudate putamen [ f(3,20),
p < .05], ca1 ( f = 10.0, p < .05), and cingulate cortex
( f = 10.1, p < .05).
acea 1021 provided complete protection against (s)mdma-induced 5-ht and 5-hiaa depletion in the cingulate cortex and ca1 region, while only providing partial
protection in the caudate putamen.
acea 1021 also appears to attenuate an (s)-mdmainduced decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  density in the caudate putamen
and ca1 region, although this was not statistically significant. in this experiment, (s)-mdma did not deplete
the density of  xxxg2150xxx  in the cingulate cortex (table 3);
however, this has occurred in other experiments (results
not published).
there was a significant drug effect on temperature over
the entire test period [ f(3,5) = 14.0, p < .001] (fig. 3). a
significant increase in core body temperature occurred
between 30 and 90 min after the injection series began in
the groups given (s)-mdma (xå = 38.7°c, p < .05) relative
to the group given saline (xå = 37.8°c). this group exhibited

a further increase (xå = 39.9°c, p < .05) that continued until
450 min before the temperature returned to baseline 600 min
from the beginning of the test period.
during the time period between 90 and 210 min, a
significant decrease in body temperature occurred in the
group given acea 1021 (xå = 36.4°c, p < .05) compared to
those given saline that returned to baseline approximately
360 min after the beginning of the test period.
the group given (s)-mdma and acea 1021 combined
did not exhibit a significant decrease in core body temperature.
over the test period, drug treatment caused a significant
change in the mac [ f(3,5) = 16.0, p < .001] (fig. 4). there
was a significant increase in mac in animals given (s)mdma (xå = 60, p < .05) by 90 min.
the group given combined acea 1021 and (s)mdma also showed a significant increase after 90 min
(xå = 34, p < .05) when compared with the group given
saline (xå = 15). the increase in mac continued between
90 and 210 min (xå = 74, xå = 58, p < .05, respectively)

4. discussion
these experiments have clearly shown that glycine sitespecific nmda antagonists, acea 1021 and (r)-ha 966,
are unable to prevent dexfenfluramine-induced serotonergic
depletion. it has also been demonstrated that acea 1021
can prevent mdma-induced dopaminergic and serotonergic toxicity.
dexfenfluramine depleted 5-ht, 5-hiaa content, and  xxxg2150xxx  density 7 days after drug treatment, as found in other
laboratories (mccann et al., 1994; stewart et al., 1997).
dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg) did not produce a consistent
depletion of serotonergic markers in all regions, consequently, the dose was increased to 15 mg/kg, which produced more consistent results (see table 1).
the failure of acea 1021 or (r)-ha 966 to prevent
dexfenfluramine-induced serotonergic depletion indicates
that glycine site-specific nmda antagonists are unable
to modulate dexfenfluramine-induced serotonergic toxicity.
investigation has shown that dexfenfluramine causes widespread 5-ht and extracellular glutamate release in vivo
(rocher et al., 1999), although mdma does not (nash
and yamamoto, 1992). in comparison with dexfenfluramine, meth also increases glutamate release and produces damage (nash and yamamoto, 1992), and glycine
site-specific nmda antagonists also do not prevent
meth-induced neurotoxicity (layer et al., 1993). this
suggests that dexfenfluramine or meth-induced neurotoxicity is unrelated to nmda receptor activation and
does not involve excitatory amino acids, in particular
glutamate (glu).
dexfenfluramine produced minor decreases in core body
temperature of approximately 1°c that do not appear to be
dose-dependent (see figs. 1 and 2). following administration of the fenfluramine racemate, small changes in ambient

571

temperature can induce hypo or hyperthermia (malberg and
seiden, 1997). in the experiments by malberg and seiden
(1997), the first dose of fenfluramine decreased body
temperature by more than 1.5°c, considerably more than
the minor decreases observed in these experiments. this
suggests that the fenfluramine racemate, through the lisomer, has a greater effect on body temperature than
dexfenfluramine. the difference in temperature effects is
unlikely to be a dose effect because malberg and seiden
(1997) used a dose of 12.5 mg/kg ip, which is comparable to
the present study. however, malberg and seiden (1997) did
give one dose each hour, four times, as opposed to one dose
every 2 h as in the present experiments, consequently the
greater total decrease of ÿ 2.8°c could be the result of
cumulative dosing.
these experiments have demonstrated that when given
alone the glycine site-specific nmda antagonist acea
1021 causes significant hypothermia (fig. 3). although (r)ha 966 did not produce a significant change in core body
temperature when given alone, if given before dexfenfluramine, significant hypothermia occurred (fig. 2). in addition, dexfenfluramine combined with either acea 1021 or
(r)-ha 966 induced a significantly greater decrease in core
body temperature than dexfenfluramine alone (figs. 1 and
2), without significantly altering locomotor activity (data
not shown).
when using this method of radiotelemetry as a measure
of locomotor activity, the monitor counts changes in position of the radiotransmitter over a series of receivers beneath
the animal cage. hence, when recording movement counts
by this method, the animal may be moving over small
distances, for example, swaying, or exhibiting stereotyped
behavior, so the count may not be the result of increased
locomotor activity but a reflection of these other behaviors.
consequently, the recorded mac may not be a true reflection of locomotor activity unless the mac is very high and/
or the animal is hyperactive and moving about the cage.
dexfenfluramine, acea 1021, and (r)-ha 966 produced
only minor differences in locomotor activity when compared with saline (data not shown). so, although dexfenfluramine induced significant differences in mac that were
modified by acea 1021 and (r)-ha 966, the changes were
not considered to be biologically significant.
(s)-mdma-induced regional decreases in 5-ht and 5hiaa content are comparable to those found by other
laboratories (colado and green, 1994; schmidt, 1987). a
significant decrease in the regional density of  xxxg2150xxx  also
compares well with figures shown by other laboratories
(battaglia et al., 1987; de souza and battaglia, 1989). (s)mdma also caused an unexpected significant decrease in
da and dopac content in the striatum. in the past, this
laboratory has observed an occasional inconsistent decrease
in da content in rats after giving the mdma racemate (r.
laverty, unpublished observations). early work examining
the neurotoxicity caused by (s)-mdma also observed
regional da depletion (commins et al., 1987; schmidt,

572

b.r. russell, r. laverty / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 68 (2001) 565±574

1987; slikker et al., 1988). in general, however, mdma has
been usually regarded as a selective serotonergic neurotoxin
in rats.
in the majority of studies carried out, (  )-mdma is
used. (s)-mdma is more toxic than (r)-mdma and causes
da depletion (commins et al., 1987; schmidt et al., 1987).
(s)-mdma is also a more potent releaser of da than (r)mdma, although both are similar in potency with respect
to their ability to induce 5-ht release (johnson et al., 1986).
consequently, (  )-mdma administration would produce
differing effects on da and 5-ht release from those caused
by an individual isomer.
the neurotoxicity of amphetamine analogues increases
with their ability to increase da release (schmidt and
kehne, 1990), so, given the relative potencies of the two
mdma stereoisomers in this respect, it is not surprising
that (s)-mdma is more toxic than (r)-mdma. behavioral studies have also demonstrated that the (s)-mdma
isomer is more potent than (r)-mdma (glennon et al.,
1987). in addition, the two isomers of mdma and the
racemate produce different responses in humans. for
example, subjects stated that the effects of (s)-mdma
were slower in onset than those of the racemate (nichols et
al., 1986). the fact that different behavioral responses in
both animals and humans alone are induced by individual
isomers suggests there are significant differences in their
neurochemical effects.
toxicity may also vary within major structures, such as
the striatum, with the result that subtle changes within
regions could be missed. for example, the results here show
a (s)-mdma-induced decrease in da content in one
specific portion of the caudate, but it is uncertain if this
depletion is evident within all areas of the caudate. incorrect
assumptions could also have been made about the mechanism behind mdma-induced neurotoxicity. higher doses of
mdma may also be required to induce dopaminergic
damage in rats. regardless, the assumption that mdma is
selective only for serotonergic markers requires revision.
(s)-mdma induced a significant hyperthermia, as has
been previously demonstrated with (  )-mdma (broening
et al., 1995; farfel and seiden, 1995b; gordon et al., 1991).
the hyperthermia produced by (  )-mdma is dependent on
ambient temperature and changes of less than 4°c can make
the difference between inducing hyper- or hypothermia
(malberg et al., 1996). this appears to be the first study
examining core body temperature that has used the (s)mdma isomer and not the racemate.
the glycine site-specific nmda antagonist acea 1021
alone produced hypothermia. however, when combined
with (s)-mdma, it prevented (s)-mdma-induced hyperthermia, which is possibly how it protects against (s)mdma-induced da and 5-ht depletion.
administration of the noncompetitive channel-blocking
nmda antagonist mk-801 produces hypothermia. indeed,
many investigators attribute the neuroprotective properties
of this class of drug to its ability to produce hypothermia

because, by maintaining the hyperthermia produced by
mdma, the neuroprotective properties of mk-801 were
abolished (farfel and seiden, 1995b; miller and o'callaghan, 1995). although experiments conducted by these
groups used either competitive or noncompetitive channelblocking nmda antagonists rather than a glycine sitespecific nmda antagonist.
acea 1021 provides a neuroprotective effect when
combined with (s)-mdma without producing marked
hypothermia. it may be that the ability of this class of drug
to provide protection in this model is reliant on its ability to
maintain a normal body temperature. however, it has been
shown that mdma can cause neurotoxicity without inducing hyperthermia (broening et al., 1995).
(s)-mdma caused a significant increase in locomotor
activity, an effect also observed by many others. behavioral
studies have been carried out examining schedule-controlled
responding that indicate that (s)-mdma is more potent than
its stereoisomer (r)-mdma (callaway and geyer, 1992).
the finding that acea 1021 blocks serotonergic and
dopaminergic neurotoxicity induced by (s)-mdma was of
interest, because another group (layer et al., 1993) using
glycine site-specific antagonists, i.e., (r)-ha 966 (50 mg/
kg) and acpc, were unable to protect against methinduced neurotoxicity in mice. this could be accounted
for by differences between the neurotoxic mechanism
behind meth or mdma-induced neurotoxicity or the
sensitivity of neurons in either mice or rats to mdmainduced da depletion, which commonly occurs in mice but
is rarely observed in rats (logan et al., 1988).
glycine site-specific nmda antagonists, while blocking
the same receptor function as channel-blocking nmda
antagonists, have different physiological effects, and so
their neuroprotective mechanisms are probably different.
this suggests that nmda receptors are not a key factor
in neuroprotection against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. these experiments illustrate the interplay between
physiological and pharmacological factors, for instance
body temperature, activity, and receptor type, all of which
need careful control to perform useful experiments. they
also demonstrate that while many amphetamine derivatives
induce neurotoxicity, they do so by different mechanisms
susceptible to different antagonists.
