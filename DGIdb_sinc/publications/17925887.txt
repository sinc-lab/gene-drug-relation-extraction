 xxxd3284xxx .   xxxd3284xxx  is a new synthetic retinoid drug recently approved for relapsed or refractory acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl) in japan. it is a specific agonist for  xxxg1931xxx /beta. compared to  xxxd3417xxx  (atra), a natural retinoid indicated for a first-line treatment of apl,  xxxd3284xxx  is chemically more stable and several times more potent as an inducer of differentiation in  xxxg1785xxx  cells. in contrast to atra, whose plasma concentration declines considerably during daily administration,  xxxd3284xxx  sustains plasma level probably due to a lower affinity for cellular  xxxd3417xxx  binding protein. furthermore, adverse side effects were milder than those of atra in clinical trials. clinical trials held in japan showed that  xxxd3284xxx  had efficacy in apl patients who had relapsed from atra-induced complete remission. recently, better understanding of the various mechanisms of action of retinoids has stimulated great interest in its potential use for treatment of various diseases.  xxxd3284xxx  is being investigated for treatment of multiple myeloma and crohn's disease in clinical trials. this review focuses on  xxxd3284xxx 's mechanisms of action, chemical properties, pharmacokinetics and its use in apl as well as its potential use in various disorders.
