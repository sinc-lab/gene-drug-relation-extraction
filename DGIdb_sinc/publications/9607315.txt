abstract l-type ca 2+ channels are important targets for drugs,
such as dihydropyridines (dhps), in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. channel expression is regulated by alternative
splicing. it has been suggested that in the cardiovascular system
tissue-specific expression of different l-type ca 2+ channel splice
variants may underlie the observed differences in sensitivities to
channel block by dhps. we investigated the sensitivity of ca 2+
channel splice variants derived from the human k1c gene to the
dhp isradipine. among seven k1c channels we observed up to
10-fold differences in ic50 values for isradipine, as well as
changes in the voltage dependence of dhp action.

1. introduction
voltage-gated ca2 channels are heteromeric protein complexes where the main subunit, k1 , forms the voltage-sensitive
functional pore structure [1^3]. it is composed of four homologous domains (i^iv), each of which contains six putative
transmembrane segments (s1^s6). the k1c subunit is a part
of the dihydropyridine (dhp)-sensitive l-type ca2 channel.
sites of dhp interaction with k1c subunits have been located
in and around domains iiis5^s6 and ivs6 [4^10]. more recently, high a¤nity dhp sensitivity could be conferred to
non-l-type ca2 channels by transferring only 8^9 amino
acids [11^13], which therefore provide the minimal constituents of the dhp binding site. however, amino acid sequences
located outside these regions [14^16] as well as the interaction
between k1c subunits and auxiliary subunits [17^20] appear to
modulate dhp sensitivity.
we have studied the dhp sensitivity of several ca2 channels which are splice variants of the human k1c gene that was
originally cloned from ¢broblasts [21], but is virtually identical to that in other tissues, such as heart and brain. these
channel k1c subunits were coexpressed in xenopus oocytes
with the auxiliary k2 /n and l1 subunits. we show that amino
acid sequences located in segments iiis2 and ivs3 can slightly
a¡ect the interaction between the dhp isradipine and ca2
channels. however, the strongest e¡ects on the isradipine sen*corresponding author. fax: (41) (31) 632 49 92.

sitivity were seen in isoforms where alternative splicing modi¢es sequences before and in is6 and in the c terminus of k1c .
di¡erences in ic50 values for isradipine spanned an up to
10-fold range. this adds additional evidence to previous
results [14^16] indicating that structures distant from the
high a¤nity dhp binding site are involved in the modulation
of channel block by dhps.
2. materials and methods
2.1. preparation of human k1c subunit isoforms
the construction of the recombinant plasmids phlcc77,
phlcc70, phlcc72, and phlcc86, encoding k1c;77 , k1c;70 ,
k1c;72 , and k1c;86 , respectively, has been described elsewhere [15,22].
however, please note that in our earlier paper [15] the two isoforms
k1c;77 and k1c;70 were called k1c;22 and k1c;21 , respectively, which
emphasized the di¡erent exons present in the two constructs.
partial clones and nucleotide positions (in parentheses) in the following description refer to the human ¢broblast ca2 channel cdna
[21]. the recombinant plasmid phlcc69 (embl database accession
number z34809), encoding k1c;69 , was prepared by using the mroi
(3462)/aatii (4275) fragment from f39, and aatii (4275)/sphi (4747)
fragment from uf11 in the scheme leading to phlcc70 [15]. the
plasmid phlcc78 (embl database accession number z34816), encoding k1c;78 , was obtained by the replacement of the muni (721)/sfui
(3726) fragment of phlcc69 with the respective fragment of
phlcc70. for the construction of phlcc105 (embl database
accession number aj224873), the plasmid that encodes the k1c;105
subunit, a fragment (1404^1738) containing the alternative exon 8a
was ¢rst cloned by rt-pcr using poly(a) rna from human hippocampus (clontech, palo alto, ca) as template. the rsai (1421)/
sphi (1711) fragment from this ampli¢cation product (clone p23/45)
was further subcloned into phlcc77. the construction of the mutant
k1c;77 containing two amino acid substitutions in iiis3 (g954f,
y958i) has been described [15].
2.2. electrophysiological measurements
xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as described before [15,23].
for microinjection, crnas were transcribed in vitro after linearization of template cdna [15,24]. crnas encoding the di¡erent k1c
subunit isoforms were always coinjected with crnas encoding the
auxiliary subunits k2 n [25] and l1 [26,27]. electrophysiological experiments were carried out at room temperature 4^7 days after the injection. the oocytes were continuously superfused with a solution
containing (in mm): ba(oh)2 40, naoh 50, koh 1, hepes 10,
ph 7.4 ( xxxd390xxx  acid). the dhp sensitivity was studied by
using the dhp ca2 channel blocker (+)-isradipine, kindly provided
by dr. r.p. hof (sandoz, basel, switzerland). isradipine-containing
media were prepared fresh from a concentrated stock solution (1 mm
in ethanol) and superfused until a steady-state inhibition of the ba2
current (iba ) was reached. the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique
was applied to measure iba , either with an axoclamp 2-a ampli¢er
(axon instruments, foster city, ca, usa) or with a warner oocyte
clamp oc-725c ampli¢er (warner instruments, hamden, nj, usa).
cumulative dose-response curves were plotted and ic50 values and
slopes were estimated by applying a double logarithmic regression
through data points between ic80 and ic20 .
in some batches of injected oocytes we observed an endogenous,
dhp-resistant ca2 current [28], which could in£uence the dose-response curves obtained in xenopus oocytes when only small currents

through the heterologously expressed k1c isoforms were recorded. we
therefore excluded all recordings from oocytes with less than 500 na
iba at a test pulse to +20 mv applied from a holding potential (vh ) of
390 mv. based on this criterion, we also re-analyzed data presented
before [15].

3. results
3.1. structural and electrophysiological properties of human
k1c splice variants
the putative transmembrane topology of the human k1c
subunit is schematically presented in fig. 1a. the gene encoding the human k1c subunit is composed of at least 50 exons
[29] and its expression is characterized by alternative splicing
[21,29,30]. based on our reference channel k1c;77 , we constructed cdnas encoding six isoforms of the k1c subunit,
containing various combinations of alternatively spliced exons
in four regions of the k1c gene. three of these alternative
regions, located in segments iiis2, ivs3, and the c-terminus
(fig. 1a), have already been documented [21,29]. the isoforms k1c;70 , k1c;69 , k1c;78 , k1c;72 , and k1c;86 contain alternative exons within these three regions (fig. 1b). another site of
diversity, identi¢ed in k1c from human hippocampus (n. soldatov, unpublished) and encoding segment is6 (fig. 1a), is
due to equally sized alternative exons 8a and 8. in the human
k1c gene, exon 8a precedes exon 8 and both are separated by
a 303-bp intron (embl database accession number z26263).
the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 8 and 8a, respectively, are identical to those found in k1c from rabbit smooth
muscle [31] and rabbit cardiac ca2 channels [32]. the isoform k1c;105 contains exon 8a instead of exon 8 in k1c;77 (fig.
1b).
in xenopus oocytes, when coexpressed with auxiliary sub-

units k2 n and l1 , all constructs gave rise to functional ca2
channels with some distinct electrophysiological features (fig.
2a^c). the isoforms k1c;69 , k1c;70 , and k1c;78 exhibit ba2
currents similar to k1c;77 , with almost the same voltage ranges
of activation (i-v curves, fig. 2b) and inactivation (fig. 2c).
this indicates that sequences in segments iiis2 and ivs3,
encoded by alternatively spliced exons 21/22 and 31/32, do
not seem to be critically involved in channel gating. in contrast, k1c;105 , k1c;72 , and k1c;86 show di¡erences in gating
behavior when compared to k1c;77 . while the i-v curve of
k1c;86 is shifted towards more positive potentials, the isochronic inactivation curves of all three constructs are more
negative than k1c;77 (fig. 2c). in addition, the two isoforms
k1c;72 and k1c;86 , which contain alterations in c-terminal sequences because of alternative splicing of exons 40^43,
showed signi¢cantly faster inactivation kinetics of iba (fig.
2a and [22]). thus, certain amino acid residues near and within is6 as well as in the c-terminus a¡ect the i-v relationship
and/or inactivation of k1c isoforms.
3.2. isradipine sensitivity of k1c splice variants
our main interest in this study concerned the pharmacological properties of the k1c isoforms. injected oocytes were voltage-clamped from vh = 390 mv or 340 mv. step depolarizations to +20 mv were applied every 30 s, as described before
[15]. we have observed that endogenous, dhp-insensitive currents may occur in some batches of xenopus oocytes injected
with crna combinations containing k2 n and l1 . therefore,
we re-analyzed data obtained before [15] and performed new
experiments with channel subunits k1c;77 (formerly k1c;22 ) and
k1c;70 (formerly k1c;21 ).
fig. 3a shows cumulative dose-response curves for k1c;77
and its isoforms encoded by cdnas containing di¡erent

fig. 1. schematic representation of the k1c subunit and its isoforms. a: the human k1c subunit is characterized by four homologous domains
(i^iv), each containing six transmembrane segments (s1^s6). segments encoded by alternatively spliced exons are indicated. b: the cdna
constructs with alternatively spliced exons are schematically presented, with the respective exon combinations indicated in the right column.
exons 8 and 8a, 21 and 22, as well as 31 and 32 are pairs of mutually exclusive homologous exons. the presence of exon 41a in k1c;72 leads
to an insertion of 19 amino acids in the c-terminus. in k1c;86 , the combination of exons 40a, 40b, and 43a encodes a segment of 81 amino
acids replacing 80 non-identical amino acids in k1c;77 .

vh = 390 mv are shown. the values of the depolarizing test potential are indicated on the left. b: normalized current-voltage (i-v) curves.
c: isochronic inactivation curves for all k1c isoforms. the inactivation curves were obtained by using a double-pulse protocol consisting of a

boltzman equation of 3^21 experiments. for clarity, error bars were not added.

exons in iiis3 and ivs2 coding regions. the presence of exon
21 (¢lled symbols) in combination with either exon 32 or 31,
encoding k1c;70 or k1c;78 , respectively, shifted the dose-response curves slightly to the right when compared to corresponding channels k1c;77 and k1c;69 encoded by cdnas containing exon 22 (fig. 3a, open symbols, and table 1). the
largest ic50 was obtained for k1c;70 at 390 mv, with a signi¢cant reduction of the slope for the dose-response curve
(table 1). the data obtained for k1c;77 and k1c;70 are qualitatively similar to the previous results [15], although the differences are less pronounced. our former results [15] with
k1c;77 , where two amino acids in segment iiis2 had been
mutated (g954f, y958i), could only be partially reproduced.
the ic50 value at vh 390 mv was signi¢cantly larger in
k1c;77 g954f;y958i , which qualitatively resembles our previous
results. unlike before, however, slopes of dose-response
curves and voltage dependence (ic50 ratio) of isradipine action at both holding potentials were very similar to those in
wild type k1c;77 (table 1). our explanation for the discrepancies with the published data [15] is a larger contribution of the
endogenous current in the earlier experiments, resulting in a
reduced sensitivity to isradipine with higher ic50 values at vh
390 mv.
replacement of exon 32 (fig. 3a, dotted lines) by exon 31
(fig. 3a, solid lines), in combination with either exon 21 or
22, shifted the dose-response curves toward slightly higher
concentrations of isradipine (compare k1c;77 with k1c;69
(open symbols) and k1c;70 with k1c;78 (closed symbols), and
table 1).
in fig. 3b dose-response curves are presented with channel
subunits k1c;105 , k1c;72 , and k1c;86 . changes of amino acid
sequences around segment is6, encoded by exons 8/8a

(k1c;77 , k1c;105 ) or in c-terminal segments encoded by exons
40^43 (k1c;72 , k1c;86 ) had a pronounced e¡ect on the sensitivity of the channels towards isradipine. the dose-response
curve for channel k1c;105 is shifted to the right compared to
channel k1c;77 (dotted lines in fig. 3b), with 2^3-fold increases of the ic50 values at the two holding potentials (table
1). in contrast, k1c;72 and k1c;86 show an increase of the
isradipine sensitivity with more than 3-fold reduction in ic50
values compared to k1c;77 (table 1). in addition to ic50 values for isradipine dose-response curves, table 1 also indicates
di¡erences in slopes and in voltage dependence of isradipine
action. thus, the strongest voltage-dependent e¡ect on ic50
values was seen with k1c;78 and the weakest with k1c;105 .
4. discussion
l-type ca2 channels are important targets for drug treatment of human cardiovascular disorders. among a variety of
known ca2 channel blockers [33], dhps are the most speci¢c
and most potent drugs to inhibit l-type ca2 currents. this
channel block occurs in a voltage-dependent manner [34,35].
channel structures for high a¤nity dhp binding have been
identi¢ed in segments iiis5, iiis6, and ivs6 [11^13,33]. the
molecular mechanisms by which the potency of dhp action is
a¡ected by the membrane potential, however, have yet to be
elucidated in detail. a recent report [36] suggests that residues
which are part of the dhp binding sites are also involved in
the voltage dependence of dhp block. our results partially
con¢rm and extend previous evidence presented by us [15] and
by others [14,16], indicating that additional structural components modulate this voltage dependence. our data also show
that alternative splicing of k1c genes can have important im-

plications for the dhp sensitivities of l-type ca2 channels.
the channel subunits k1c;70 , k1c;69 , and k1c;78 are isoforms of

k1c;77 originally derived from human ¢broblasts [21], while
transcripts leading to k1c;72 , k1c;86 , and k1c;105 were identi¢ed
in human hippocampus ([29] and unpublished). notably exons
8 and 8a, encoding sequences in constructs k1c;77 and k1c;105
respectively, are interesting because the distinct spatial distribution of the homologous exons in the rat cardiovascular
system underlies the tissue speci¢city for dhp action [16].
although our channel isoform k1c;105 di¡ers from that studied
by welling et al. [16] in containing exon 22 instead of exon 21,
our results con¢rm the lower dhp sensitivity of k1c subunits
with an amino acid sequence encoded by exon 8a. it would be
interesting to see whether the combined sequences encoded by
exons 8a and 21 would lead to an even lower a¤nity for
isradipine binding, since each sequence alone increases ic50
values several-fold (compare k1c;70 and k1c;105 in table 1).
in conclusion, our results show substantial variability in
isradipine sensitivity between several splice variants of human
l-type ca2 channels. additional studies of their tissue-speci¢c expression and function would be desirable. they could
provide further information about the clinical potency and
speci¢city of ca2 channel blockade in di¡erent organs.
