gastric mucin secretion in response to beta-adrenergic  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  activation is mediated by src kinase-dependent epidermal growth f...  in many systems, the integration of converging regulatory signals that relay on  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  (gpcr) activation into functional cellular pathways requires the involvement of receptor  xxxg2198xxx . in this report, we provide evidence that activation of gpcr by beta-adrenergic agonist leading to stimulation in gastric mucin secretion requires  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) participation. using [(3)h]glucosamine-labeled gastric mucosal cells, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx , on mucin secretion was inhibited by egfr kinase inhibitor, pd153035, as well as  xxxd3536xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx . both inhibitors, moreover, blunted the mucin secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second messenger, camp as well as adenylate cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx . the gastric mucin secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx , furthermore, were inhibited by  xxxd1307xxx , a selective inhibitor of  xxxg2198xxx  src responsible for ligand-independent egfr autophosphorylation, but not by erk inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx . the inhibition of erk, moreover, did not cause attenuation in mucin secretion in response to camp and  xxxd1742xxx . the findings underline the role of egfr as a convergence point in gastric mucin secretion triggered by beta-adrenergic gpcr activation, and demonstrate the requirement for src kinase in egfr transactivation.
