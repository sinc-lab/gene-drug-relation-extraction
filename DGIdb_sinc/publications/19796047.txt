melatonin-induced  xxxg730xxx  alpha-mediated calbindin-d9k expression plays a role in h2o2-mediated cell death in rat pituitary gh3 cells.  calbindin-d9k (cabp-9k) is a 9-kda polypeptide possessing two calcium-binding sites that is expressed in the mammalian intestine, uterus, and pituitary gland. the factors regulating the expression of the  xxxg730xxx  (er) and cabp-9k in the pituitary gland are currently unknown. in this study, we investigated whether the er and cabp-9k expression are regulated by melatonin during h(2)o(2)-induced cell death in rat pituitary gh3 cells. cell survival increased by approximately 27-36% in h(2)o(2) plus melatonin compared to h(2)o(2) alone, and cabp-9k expression was augmented by treatment with h(2)o(2) plus melatonin. these results suggest that the increase in cell survival and the melatonin-induced cabp-9k expression may play a role in protecting cells against h(2)o(2)-mediated cell death. this result is also consistent with the increase in cabp-9k expression leading to rises in p-erk and p-bad (s112). over-expression of cabp-9k caused an increase in p-erk.  xxxg730xxx  expression was higher in h(2)o(2) plus melatonin-treated cells compared to those treated with h(2)o(2) alone, while  xxxg731xxx  expression was not. also,  xxxg730xxx  in the nuclear fraction increased in the presence of melatonin and decreased in the presence of  xxxd2165xxx  780 or  xxxd2165xxx  780 plus melatonin. the relative binding affinity of  xxxg730xxx  for melatonin was higher than that of  xxxg731xxx , suggesting that melatonin has the potential to preferentially bind  xxxg730xxx . in conclusion, these results indicate that melatonin may increase cabp-9k expression through  xxxg730xxx .
