abstract two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of lutein and fat or  xxxd2318xxx 
(epa) interaction on  xxxg1578xxx  (inos), ppars a, b, and g, and  xxxd3417xxx  x receptor (rxr)
a and g mrna levels. in expt. 1, macrophages were collected from broiler chicks fed 3 or 6% dietary fat (g/100 g)
with 0, 25, and 50 mg lutein/kg feed for 23 d. in expt. 2, using a 3 3 3 factorial,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) at 0, 15
and 50mmol/l and lutein at 0, 10 and 100mmol/l were applied to hd11 cell culture for 24 h. in both experiments, cells
were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide before rna isolation. lutein interacted with fat in expt. 1 and with epa in
expt. 2 to affect mrna levels of inos,  xxxg1807xxx , and  xxxg1998xxx  in chicken macrophages and hd11 cells, respectively
(p , 0.05). at 3% dietary fat or up to 15 mmol/l epa in the medium, increasing lutein increased the inos mrna.
however, at 6% dietary fat or 50 mmol/l epa, lutein did not cause a rise in inos mrna. increasing lutein in the
medium from 0 to 100 mmol/l decreased inos mrna. increasing lutein with high fat (6%) or epa (15 mmol/l epa)
increased  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  mrna levels. lutein increased  xxxg1805xxx  mrna levels in both macrophages (p , 0.01)
and hd11 (p ¼ 0.01) cells and  xxxg2000xxx  (p , 0.01) mrna levels in macrophages.  xxxd1216xxx , a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist,
prevented (p , 0.01) the lutein-induced inos mrna downregulation in hd11 cells. lg101208, a rxr antagonist,
prevented (p , 0.01) inos upregulation induced by 10 mmol/l lutein and inos mrna downregulation induced by
100 mmol/l lutein. we conclude that lutein and epa interact through the  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr pathways to modulate
inos mrna. j. nutr. 136: 1610–1616, 2006.

xanthophylls, a group of carotenoids, have diminished or no
provitamin a activity. lutein, a xanthophyll lacking  xxxd3105xxx 
activity, is enriched in the lens of the eye and in the retinal
macular region (1). derivatives of another xanthophyll, canthaxanthin, activate nuclear hormone receptors (nr)3 (2).
xanthophylls modulate immunity and cancer cell proliferation
in humans (1). among leukocytes, macrophages are particularly sensitive to modulation by xanthophylls (3).
macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) produce
 xxxd2738xxx  using  xxxg1578xxx  (inos).
inappropriate upregulation of inos is associated with cancers
and inflammatory disorders (4). we showed previously that
dietary lutein and fat interact to modify nitrite production in
lps-stimulated macrophages (5). high levels of dietary lutein
increase nitrite production; however, high levels of fat reverse
the stimulatory effect of lutein.
nuclear factor (nf) kb, a transcription factor with highly
regulated activity, increases inos gene expression. ppar/
 xxxd3417xxx  x receptor (rxr) complexes act through
1
2

sequestration of essential coactivators, receptor mutual antagonism, or by cross-coupling to inhibit nfkb (6).
pufa and eicosanoids activate ppar. higher levels of
dietary (7) or plasma  xxxd2154xxx  (8) upregulate different ppar
isomers through ppar coactivator 1a protein (8). modulation
of gene activity by ppar requires the presence of ligated rxr
(9). ligand-bound ppar/rxr heterodimerize and bind coactivators, and this complex further binds to response elements
(re) in dna to increase downstream transcription (10). a
carotenoid derivative, 9 cis  xxxd3417xxx , pufa (11), and many
other synthetic compounds bind to the rxr ligand binding
domain. in addition, the possibility of xanthophylls activating
nr (2) and antioxidant re during transcription (12) was
explored. the presumed oxidation product of xanthophylls,
acyclo- xxxd3417xxx , transactivates a reporter gene containing
the  xxxd3417xxx  re (rare) but with a lower potency than
 xxxd3417xxx  (13). rxr activating agents upregulate rxr
isomer mrna and protein (14). we hypothesized that lutein
and fat interact to affect macrophage inos production through
ppar-rxr heterodimers, with pufa or their metabolic
products acting as a ligand for ppar, and lutein or its metabolic
products activating rxr. because ppar-rxr heterodimers act
to suppress nfkb and therefore inos (10), depressed inos
may serve as an indirect marker for increased ppar-rxr
heterodimers.
lutein (15) and pufa (9) are commonly supplemented in
human nutrition as well as in poultry diets (5). avian species

lutein- xxxd2318xxx  interaction on inos

possess the same enzymes as humans for metabolizing dietary
lutein and are excellent nonprimate animal models for metabolic studies of xanthophylls (16). the avian model is useful
because hens can be depleted of lutein so that the chicks
receive all of their lutein via the diet (17). therefore, the
following study examined the interaction of different dietary
lutein and fat levels on macrophage inos,  xxxg1805xxx , b, and g,
and  xxxg1998xxx  and g gene expression in chickens hatched from
carotenoid-depleted eggs. protein levels and mrna expressions are highly correlated for ppar isomers (18); because
commercial antibodies for chicken ppar and rxr isoform
proteins are not available, the mrna levels of the inos,
 xxxg1805xxx , b, and g, and  xxxg1998xxx  and g genes were measured as
indicators. additional in vitro studies using hd11 cells (a
chicken macrophage cell line) examined the underlying mechanism by which lutein and fat interact to influence inos.
furthermore,  xxxd1216xxx , a  xxxg1807xxx -specific antagonist, and
lg101208, a rxr-specific antagonist, were used to probe further the role of these nuclear receptors in mediating the interaction between lutein and fat.

materials and methods
the general scheme of the in vivo and in vitro experiments is
shown in figure 1. the levels of lutein and  xxxd2154xxx  in the media
used in the in vitro experiments were chosen so that the resulting
levels in phospholipids of the cultured cells would approximate the
range found in the macrophage phospholipids of chicks in the in vivo
experiment.
in vivo trial. eggs were depleted of carotenoids by feeding hens
(cobb) a carotenoid-free diet (#0.1 ng lutein, zeaxanthin, or canthaxanthin/kg diet) (17) and chicks were hatched from carotenoiddepleted eggs.
birds and experimental design. broiler c-chicks (n 5 108; 1 d
old; cobb 3 cobb) of mixed sex were distributed randomly to 1 of the
6 treatments using a 2 3 3 factorial design with 2 levels of fat (3 and
6%, by weight) and three levels of lutein (0, 25, and 50 mg/kg feed).
each treatment contained 3 replicate pens of 6 chicks/pen. the fat was
a 1.00:0.86 mixture of sunflower oil and refined menhaden fish oil
(omega proteins). this ratio was chosen to meet the minimum nrc
linoleic acid requirement (19) of chicks fed the diet with 3% fat.
isocaloric and isonitrogenous rice-soybean meal–based diets were
formulated for the groups fed 3 and 6% fat. the diets were made
isocaloric by varying the cornstarch and cellulose contents (table 1).
the basal diet contained 28 ng lutein/kg feed. lutein (oro glo dry,
kemin industries) was added at 0, 25, and 50 mg/kg feed. the chicks
were raised in petersime brooder battery cages, and experimental diets
and water were consumed ad libitum from the day of hatch. these

experiments were reviewed by the uc davis animal use and care
committee to ensure adherence to animal care guidelines.
macrophage collection. birds were bled from the vena cava and
peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by density centrifugation
(750 3 g; 15 min) from 5 ml of heparinized blood (20). purity was
determined to be .90% as indicated by modified giemsa staining.
macrophage culture and stimulation. monocytes (1 3 107) from
2 birds/pen (pooled within pen), in 2 ml of rpmi-1640, were supplemented with 1% penicillin:streptomycin (media) and 10% luteinfree chicken serum (lfcs) and incubated in 6-well culture plates at
418c in a humidified atmosphere with 5% co2. lfcs was prepared
from chickens fed a lutein-free diet (table 1). adherent cells at 4 h of
incubation were stimulated with lps (1 mg/l; sigma chemicals, #
l7261) in 2 ml of medium containing 5% lfcs for 9 h before extracting their total rna; 9 h was chosen because at this time, inos
mrna level increases in lps-stimulated chicken macrophages (21).
the chicken hd11 macrophage cell line was used for in vitro
experiments. cells were depleted of their lutein content by resuspending them in media supplemented with 5% lfcs and
incubating at 418c in a humidified atmosphere (5% co2, 95% air).
preliminary trials were conducted with  xxxd208xxx ,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha), and their combinations to determine which combination(s) interacted with lutein to
modify macrophage nitrite production. among the  xxxd2154xxx  studied,
epa showed a significant interaction with lutein in modifying macrophage nitrite production (data not shown); hence, further experiments
in cell cultures were done with epa. stock solutions (10 mmol/l) of
lutein (sigma, x6250) and epa (nu-chek-prep) as the free fatty acid,
with 4 mmol/l bht, were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)
and ethanol, respectively.
interaction between lutein and epa in hd11 cell culture. a
factorial design with 3 levels of lutein (0, 10, and 100 mmol/l) and
epa (0, 15, and 50 mmol/l) was applied to hd11 cell cultures with
3 replications/treatment. cells (1 3 107) were grown in 1 ml of
medium with 5% lfcs and appropriate levels of lutein and epa.
regardless of treatment, all of the wells had 1% dmso and 0.5%
ethanol. after 24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of medium
containing 5% lfcs and lps (0.5 mg/l). a time course was employed
to determine the optimum time for evaluating expressions of inos,
 xxxg1805xxx , b, and g, and  xxxg1998xxx  and g mrna levels as influenced by
lps at 0, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after lps stimulation. except

for  xxxg1806xxx  and inos, all of the genes were downregulated at 4 h of
lps stimulation and remained depressed until 8 h. at 8 h, inos
expression increased.  xxxg1806xxx  expression was not stimulated by lps.
because all genes that responded had altered expression levels at 8 h,
the cell cultures were stimulated with lps for 8 h before extracting
total rna.
nuclear receptor antagonists. hd11 cells (1 3 107) were
incubated with the treatment medium (3 3 3 factorial; with lutein
at 0, 10, and 100 mmol/l; epa at 0, 15, and 50 mmol/l) for 24 h. at
24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of medium containing 5%
lfcs, lps (0.5 mg/l), and either 0 or 10 mmol/l  xxxd1216xxx  (sigma
m6191), a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist in dmso. after 6 h, the medium was
replaced with medium containing 5% lfcs and lps (0.5 mg/l).
mrna was collected at 9 h after the initial lps addition. in another
experiment, lg101208 (0 or 10 nmol/l; ligand pharmaceuticals), a
rxr antagonist in dmso, was added in place of  xxxd1216xxx  for a period
of only 30 min.
rna isolation and rt-pcr. cells (1 3 107) were detached
from wells with a cell scraper, total rna was isolated, and the rt
reaction was run as described previously (22). quantitative real-time
pcr analysis of inos,  xxxg1805xxx , b, and g, and  xxxg1998xxx  and g mrna was
performed with a abi prism 7700 sequence detection system
(applied biosystems). primers were developed for inos,  xxxg1805xxx ,
b, and g, and  xxxg1998xxx  and g based on the published sequences with
the following respective genbank accession numbers, q90703,
np_001001464, np_990059, nm_001001460, xp_415426 and
p28701, respectively. the forward and reverse primers for inos
were agtggtatgctctgcctgct and ccagtcccattcttcttcc; for  xxxg1805xxx : caatgcactggaactggatg and cgtcaggatggttggtttg; for  xxxg1806xxx : catggagcccaagtttgagt and cggaggatgttgtcttggat; for  xxxg1807xxx : gggcgatcttgacaggaa and gcctccacagagcgaaac; for
 xxxg1998xxx : gatgcgagacatgcagatg and gtcggggtatttgtgcttg, and for  xxxg2000xxx : caaacacatctgtgccatctg
and gatgaggcagtccttgttgtc, respectively.
preliminary experiments confirmed that all primer pairs produced
only one product at their predicted size; when sequenced (davis
sequencing) they had 99% homology to their respective gene
transcripts (22). the 25-ml final pcr reaction volume contained
0.5 ml rt product and 2.5 ml 10x sybr green buffer, 2 ml dntp,
0.125 ml taqgold, and 0.25 ml amperase (applied biosystems
4804886) together with 300 nmol/l of forward and reverse primers
and 3 mmol/l mgcl2. in optimizing  xxxg1998xxx , the forward primer was
added at 900 nmol/l and in optimizing  xxxg2000xxx , mgcl2 was added at 4.5
mmol/l. the pcr cycle was set at 508c for 2 min followed by a
denaturation step at 958c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of
denaturing, annealing, and extension at 958c for 15 s and 608c for
1 min. the melting profile of each sample was analyzed as reported
earlier (22) after every pcr run to confirm pcr product specificity.
quantification of mrna by real-time pcr was done as reported
previously (22). all data were normalized to the mrna level of the
reference group (group fed 0 mg lutein and 3% fat in the in vivo
experiment; group with 0 mmol/l lutein and 0 mmol/l epa in the cell
culture experiments) and reported as the fold-change from the reference. fold-change from the reference was calculated as es(40-ct sample)/
er(40-ct reference), where es and er are the sample and reference pcr
amplification efficiencies, respectively, as determined in the log-linear
phase using the linregpcr program (23).
in silico analysis. using the nubiscan matrix (24), nr re in
direct repeat (dr) 1, dr2, dr3, and dr4 in the upstream 2000 bp of
the  xxxg1807xxx  chicken gene (4916652 to 4937426 bp chromosome
washuc1:12) and  xxxg1805xxx  chicken gene (67845090 to 67879306
bp chromosome washuc1:1) were identified using the suggested
general nr matrix or specific  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1805xxx  matrix and score
cut-off point of 0.70. direct repeats consist of hexameric nucleotide
sequences separated by $1 nucleotide.
statistical analysis. treatments were applied to the birds and
cells in a completely randomized design. a 2-way anova (jmp
software) was used to examine the interactive and main effects of
dietary or media treatments on the dependent variables. a 3-way
anova (jmp software) was used to examine the interactive and
main effects of dietary or media or antagonist treatments on the

dependent variables. interactions were removed from the model when
the observed p-value for an interaction was .0.20. when interaction
or main effects were significant (p , 0.05), differences between means
were determined using tukey’s least-square means comparison.

results
in vivo experiments
macrophage inos mrna. lutein and fat interacted (p ¼
0.01) to affect inos mrna levels in chicken macrophages
(fig. 2). macrophages from chicks fed 0 mg lutein with either 3
or 6% fat had the lowest inos level. chicks fed either 25 or 50
mg dietary lutein with 3% fat had more inos mrna than
those fed 0 mg lutein, but this did not occur when the fat level
was 6%.
macrophage  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  mrna. lutein and fat
interacted to affect  xxxg1807xxx  (p ¼ 0.05) and  xxxg1998xxx  (p ¼ 0.03)
mrna levels in chicken macrophages (fig. 3). macrophages
from chicks fed 50 mg lutein and 6% fat had higher (p ¼ 0.05)
 xxxg1807xxx  mrna levels than those from chicks administered any
other treatment. macrophages from chicks fed 6% fat and
either 25 or 50 mg lutein had higher  xxxg1998xxx  mrna levels than
those from chicks fed 0 or 25 mg lutein and 3% fat. in the group
fed 3% fat, macrophages from birds fed 50 mg lutein had higher
(p ¼ 0.03)  xxxg1998xxx  mrna than the group fed 0 mg lutein.
macrophage  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg2000xxx  mrna. lutein
and fat did not interact to affect and fat level did not affect
 xxxg1805xxx  or  xxxg2000xxx  mrna levels in chicken macrophages.
lutein increased both  xxxg1805xxx  (p , 0.01) and  xxxg2000xxx  (p ,
0.01) mrna levels (table 2).  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  mrna
levels were significantly greater in chickens fed 50 mg lutein
than in those fed 0 mg lutein.  xxxg1806xxx  mrna levels in chicken
macrophages were not affected by lutein, fat, or their interaction.

hd11 cell  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  mrna. lutein and epa
interacted to increase  xxxg1807xxx  (p , 0.01) and  xxxg1998xxx  (p ¼
0.01) mrna levels in hd11 cells (fig. 5). hd11 cells treated
with 0 mmol/l lutein had lower  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  mrna
than those treated with 50 mmol/l lutein. increasing the lutein
to 100 mmol/l in the absence of epa did not affect the
expression of  xxxg1807xxx  or  xxxg1998xxx , but in the presence of 15 or 50
mmol/l epa, lutein increased  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  expression.
epa in the absence of lutein did not change  xxxg1807xxx  or  xxxg1998xxx 
expression, but at 100 mmol/l lutein, 50 mmol/l epa increased
 xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  mrna levels compared with the group
treated with 0 mmol/l epa.
hd11 cell  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg2000xxx  mrna.  xxxg1805xxx 
mrna levels in hd11 cells were not affected by epa, or an
epa 3 lutein interaction. lutein increased (p ¼ 0.01)  xxxg1805xxx 
mrna levels in hd11 cells (table 2). hd11 cells incubated
with 100 mmol/l lutein had a higher  xxxg1805xxx  mrna level than
those incubated with 0 mmol/l lutein (p ¼ 0.01).  xxxg1806xxx  and
 xxxg2000xxx  mrna levels in hd11 cells were not affected by lutein
(p ¼ 0.31, p ¼ 0.87), epa (p ¼ 0.22, p ¼ 0.73), or their
interaction (p ¼ 0.67, p ¼ 0.93), respectively.
inos expression in the presence of a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist. cells treated with 10 mmol/l  xxxd1216xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx  antagonist) expressed 14-fold more inos than the group treated
with 0 mmol/l  xxxd1216xxx  (p , 0.01; data not shown). because
of this large difference in inos mrna, the data for the 10
mmol/l  xxxd1216xxx  were normalized within the antagonist
treatment to the 0 mmol/l lutein with 0 mmol/l epa group.
the antagonist, epa, and lutein interacted (p , 0.01) to affect
inos expression in hd11 cells (fig. 6). the addition of 10
mmol/l  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist reversed the inos-depressing
effect of 100 mmol/l lutein, and this effect was most
pronounced at 15 and 50 mmol/l epa. the inos mrna–
depressing effect of 50 mmol/l epa in the 10 mmol/l lutein
group was not affected by the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist.
inos expression in the presence of a rxr antagonist.
cells treated with 10 nmol/l lg101208 (rxr antagonist)
expressed 18-fold more inos than those treated with 0 mmol/l
lg101208 (p , 0.01; data not shown). because of this large
difference in inos mrna, the data for the 10 nmol/l
lg101208 were normalized within the antagonist treatment to
the 0 mmol/l lutein with 0 mmol/l epa group. the antagonist,
epa, and lutein interacted (p , 0.01) to affect inos
expression in hd11 cells (fig. 7). the addition of 10 nmol/l
rxr antagonist reversed the inos-depressing effect of 100
mmol/l lutein and reversed the inos-stimulating effect of 10
mmol/l lutein. lg101208 treatment reversed the inos-

discussion
this study examined the effects of different levels of dietary
lutein and fat on lps-induced inos mrna levels in chicken
macrophages. an interaction between dietary lutein and fat
levels occurred in which lutein increased the inos mrna
levels only when dietary fat was low. because the trial was
conducted in vivo and numerous factors could have contributed to this effect, we employed a chicken macrophage cell line
(hd11) to examine the underlying mechanisms (fig. 1).
 xxxd2154xxx  and their metabolic products are ligands for
ppar. ppar are active only as heterodimers with rxr (9).
we hypothesize that lutein or its metabolites could activate
rxr through its antioxidant properties because  xxxd3521xxx  (25)
and the redox state of a cell (26) change rxr activity (25). if
lutein activates rxr, the effect of lutein-stimulating inos
(figs. 2, 4), observed only when the fat or epa was at lower
levels, could be explained from the net balance of the nfkbinos pathway as described below.  xxxd2154xxx  suppress the
nfkb- inos pathway through ppar (9). at a high lutein
concentration, the rxr could be active. this would facilitate
ppar activity and depress inos mrna. at low lutein
concentrations, the rxr would not be active and would result
in suppression of ppar activity, thereby stimulating inos
mrna.

high lutein and high epa increased  xxxg1807xxx  mrna levels
(figs. 3a, 5a). the presence of the dr1 sequence specific for
 xxxg1807xxx  in the  xxxg1807xxx  promoter indicates that  xxxg1807xxx  are
sensitive to ppar. in addition, we found dr2 and dr4
sequences in the  xxxg1807xxx  promoter region. this indicates that
 xxxg1807xxx  is also highly sensitive to rxr. lutein increased  xxxg2000xxx 
(discussed below) in macrophages and  xxxg1998xxx  in hd11 cells
and macrophages. this change, together with increased ligands
(in the form of oxidized  xxxd2154xxx  from increased  xxxd2154xxx )
for  xxxg1807xxx , could have increased  xxxg1807xxx  mrna synergistically, as reported earlier (7). here, we report that for  xxxd2154xxx 
to increase  xxxg1807xxx , a rxr agonist is needed.
 xxxd3417xxx  and several unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  specifically
bind and activate rxr (27). this indicates that rxr are fatty
acid sensors in vivo and can influence rxr-mediated gene
transcription. oxyretinoic acid, a metabolic breakdown product of xanthophylls, was proposed to activate nr (2). in our
study, cells with high lutein and epa had higher  xxxg1998xxx 
expression than those with no lutein and epa (figs. 3b, 5b).
thus, increased  xxxd2154xxx  and lutein interact to increase
 xxxg1998xxx  mrna levels.
 xxxg1805xxx  is a receptor for  xxxd2154xxx  and regulates their
cellular uptake and b-oxidation (28). to our knowledge, the
ability of lutein to increase  xxxg1805xxx  has not been reported. the

presence of a  xxxg1807xxx  dr1 sequence in the  xxxg1805xxx  promoter
region suggests that  xxxg1805xxx  would be upregulated in response
to the upregulation of  xxxg1807xxx .  xxxg1807xxx  was upregulated with
high lutein (table 2); hence, we propose that the lutein
upregulation of  xxxg1805xxx  is through upregulation of  xxxg1807xxx .
feeding chickens higher levels of lutein increased  xxxg2000xxx 
mrna levels (table 2), but hd11 cells treated with high
lutein did not have altered  xxxg2000xxx  levels. it is not clear why the
lutein effect was absent in the hd11 cells but was present in
vivo. rexinoids, by regulating the activity of multiple nuclear
receptor heterodimers, can generate integrated control of

complex metabolic pathways in ways that are not replicated by
individual nuclear receptor ligands; hence,  xxxg2000xxx  may be
governed by more complex pathways in vivo than in vitro.
both in vivo and in vitro, there were significant interactive
effects of lutein and fat or epa on inos,  xxxg1807xxx , and  xxxg1998xxx 
mrna levels and a significant independent effect of lutein on
 xxxg1805xxx . increases in  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  with high fat or epa
and lutein were accompanied by decreased inos mrna
levels. upregulation of ppar/rxr leads to transcriptional
regulation of ppar/rxr-responsive genes (28). hence, we
hypothesized that lutein and epa/fat affect inos via  xxxg1807xxx /
 xxxg1998xxx  heterodimers, with higher levels of  xxxg1807xxx / xxxg1998xxx 
suppressing inos. a synergistic effect of  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx 
ligands on reporter gene activation was reported previously
(29). to test this hypothesis, we used a  xxxg1807xxx -specific antagonist,  xxxd1216xxx , and a rxr-specific antagonist, lg101208, to
determine whether the interactive effect of lutein and epa
could be reversed. we found that blocking either nr ameliorated the interaction between lutein and epa.
earlier reports confirmed the inos-stimulating effect of
 xxxd1216xxx , wherein this  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist stimulates inos
through nfkb (30). similarly, lg101208 stimulates  xxxg2296xxx 
production in human myelomonocytic cell lines (31). natural
and synthetic  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr ligands inhibit the lps
induction of inflammatory genes. two different mechanisms
were proposed: one inhibits nfkb-dependent transcription
through a  xxxg1807xxx -dependent mechanism (10), and one is
independent of  xxxg1807xxx  (32). we observed that the action of
lutein on inos was reversed by an rxr antagonist (fig. 7),
suggesting that lutein activates rxr. to examine further the
role of lutein on rxr, we determined the effect of an rxr
antagonist on 9 cis  xxxd3417xxx  (rxr agonist)–mediated inos
suppression in lps-stimulated hd11 cells and found that 9 cis
 xxxd3417xxx  at 0.5 mmol/l depressed inos expression. this
inos depression was reversed by rxr antagonist (data not
reported).
in our experiment, the addition of lutein  xxxd1891xxx  mmol/l
increased inos expression, whereas it was suppressed at 100
mmol/l. the inos-stimulating effect of 10 mmol/l lutein was
reversed by increasing epa or rxr antagonist. the inosdepressing effect of 100 mmol/l lutein was reversed by
increasing the epa or rxr antagonist or the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist. the epa effect of suppressing inos  xxxd1891xxx  mmol/l
lutein was not reversed by the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist but was
reversed by the rxr antagonist. we propose that lutein and
epa interact through  xxxg1807xxx /rxr heterodimers to modify
lps-stimulated inos expression. increasing lutein and epa in
the presence of each other increased  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx 
mrna. at lower concentrations of lutein and epa,  xxxg1807xxx 
and rxr levels would be expected to be upregulated, but the
rxr could be unliganded. this unliganded rxr in the ppar/
rxr heterodimer would act to stimulate the nfkb pathway
(33), thus increasing the inos. this appears to be dependent
on the rxr pathway because an rxr antagonist prevented 10
mmol/l lutein from stimulating inos production. increasing
epa decreased the stimulating effect of 10 mmol/l lutein on
inos mrna.  xxxd2154xxx  act as a ligand for rxr (11),
suggesting that epa, by liganding rxr, decreases inos. this
was further confirmed when the epa-depressing effect on
inos at low lutein levels was reversed by an rxr antagonist,
but not by a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist. early reports that unliganded
rxr responses on downstream targets were independent of
 xxxg1807xxx  (10,32), would also explain our results. but because the
lutein level is increased further, the rxr in the ppar/rxr
heterodimers could be expected to be activated and suppress
inos (29). this was confirmed when either rxr or  xxxg1807xxx

antagonists reversed the inos-depressing effect of 100 mmol/l
lutein as well as the effects of epa at 100 mmol/l lutein.
because a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist reversed the inos-depressing
effect of high lutein and epa, it appears that high concentrations of lutein and epa act through rxr/ xxxg1807xxx  to suppress
inos. because the inos-stimulating effect of low lutein was
not influenced by the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist but was stimulated by
the rxr antagonist, this part is dependent on rxr but
independent of ppar.
we conclude that lutein and fat or epa act through the
 xxxg1807xxx  and rxr pathway to change inos expression, and
that this effect is dependent on the dose of lutein and fat or
epa. lutein showed rxr ligand–like activity. because of the
strong interaction between dietary lutein and fat, both of these
nutrients should be considered when examining the immunomodulatory properties of diets. functional assays with macrophages recovered from wild-type or tissue-specific ppar null
mice would provide a more compelling molecular and mechanistic basis for the regulation of the pathway inos via the
ppar and rxr pathways.
