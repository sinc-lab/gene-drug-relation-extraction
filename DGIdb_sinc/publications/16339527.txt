itamin a has long been called the “the anti-infective
vitamin” (1). this designation is appropriate because  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency impairs both innate and adaptive immunity and increases the risk of death from infectious disease (2).
 xxxd3105xxx  (retinol) is converted to its active metabolites all-transand 9- xxxd2404xxx  by specific enzymes (3).  xxxd3417xxx  then
regulates gene expression by binding to two nuclear receptors, the
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar-␣),3 -␤, and -␥, also referred to as
 xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1932xxx , and  xxxg1933xxx , respectively, and the retinoid x receptor (rxr-␣), -␤, and -␥, or  xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx , and  xxxg2000xxx , respectively (4).  xxxd3417xxx  binds with high affinity to
rar while 9- xxxd2404xxx  binds with high affinity to both rar
and rxr (5, 6). rxr homodimers or heterodimers formed with
rar or other partner receptors bind to response elements in the
promoter-enhancer region of target genes to regulate transcription (4).

nuclear receptors, including rar and rxr, play an important
role in the immune system, including t lymphocyte development,
function, and survival (7–11). for example, treatment of naive t
lymphocytes with 9- xxxd2404xxx  and the rxr-selective agonist  xxxd1731xxx  enhance in vitro development of th2 memory
cells (12).  xxxd3417xxx  has similar effects (13, 14).
apoptosis is an important regulator of the innate and adaptive
immune response (15). for example, apoptosis is induced during
thymic selection to minimize the development of self-reactive t
lymphocytes, and protection of “appropriately” stimulated thymocytes from apoptosis helps ensure generation of a naive t lymphocyte repertoire adequate for defense against pathogenic organisms (16). in the periphery, naive t lymphocytes induce
expression of the antiapoptotic proteins bcl2a1 and  xxxg251xxx  following stimulation via the tcr to ensure survival during the first few
days following antigenic stimulation. during the same time period,
cytokines such as il-2 and il-4 also enhance survival by stimulating  xxxg250xxx  expression (17). in contrast, apoptosis may be induced
by overstimulation of the tcr (activation-induced cell death, mediated by  xxxd3135xxx  engagement on targeted lymphocytes) and by
cytokine withdrawal (death by neglect, which can be reversed by
cytokines such as il-2, il-4, and  xxxg1183xxx ) (18). this balance of survival and apoptosis helps maintain protective immune responses
and ensures their successful termination and also protects the host
from damaging autoimmune responses.
little is known about the effect of retinoids on the survival of
naive or memory t lymphocytes. however, retinoids are known to
affect the survival of thymocytes, t cell hybridomas, and t lymphoma cell lines. for example,  xxxd3417xxx  and rar-selective
ligands can inhibit fas-mediated apoptosis by diminishing cell surface  xxxd3135xxx  expression in t cell hybridomas activated via the
tcr (19 –22). this antiapoptotic effect is mediated via rar-␣/
rxr heterodimers (23), whereas rar-␥ agonists can up-regulate
 xxxd3135xxx  and thus facilitate apoptosis in t cell hybridomas (24)

 xxxd3105xxx  affects many aspects of t lymphocyte development and function. the  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic
acid regulate gene expression by binding to the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar), while 9- xxxd2404xxx  also binds to the retinoid
x receptor (rxr). naive do11.10 t lymphocytes expressed mrna and protein for rar-␣, rxr-␣, and rxr-␤. dna microarray analysis was used to identify rxr-responsive genes in naive do11.10 t lymphocytes treated with the rxr agonist
 xxxd1731xxx . a total of 128 genes was differentially expressed, including 16 (15%) involved in cell growth or apoptosis. among
these was bcl2a1, an antiapoptotic  xxxg250xxx  family member. quantitative real-time pcr analysis confirmed this finding and demonstrated that bcl2a1 mrna expression was significantly greater in nonapoptotic than in apoptotic t lymphocytes. the rxr agonist
9- xxxd2404xxx  also increased bcl2a1 expression, although  xxxd3417xxx  and ligands for other rxr partner receptors
did not. treatment with  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  significantly decreased apoptosis measured by  xxxg166xxx  staining but
did not affect expression of  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx . bcl2a1 promoter activity was examined using a luciferase promoter construct. both
 xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  significantly increased luciferase activity. in summary, these data demonstrate that rxr
agonists increase bcl2a1 promoter activity and increase expression of bcl2a1 in naive t lymphocytes but do not affect  xxxg250xxx  and
 xxxg251xxx  expression in naive t lymphocytes. thus, this effect on bcl2a1 expression may account for the decreased apoptosis seen in
naive t lymphocytes treated with rxr agonists. the journal of immunology, 2005, 175: 7916 –7929.

materials and methods
mice
rag1⫺/⫺ do11.10 mice were bred in our facility. they were a gift from
dr. c. london (university of california, davis, ca). to confirm their
identity, peripheral blood from these mice was screened by two-color flow
cytometric analysis using anti-cd4 ab and the tcr clonotypic mab
kj1–26 (36). balb/c mice were purchased from charles river
laboratories.

rar-␥, sc773; rxr-␣, sc553; and rxr-␥, sc555. the ab for rxr-␤
( xxxd2211xxx -815) was purchased from affinity bioreagents. the secondary goat
anti-rabbit ab for western blots was purchased from jackson immunoresearch laboratories.
the rxr-selective agonist  xxxd1731xxx  (38) and other nuclear receptor
agonists were diluted in cell culture-grade dmso (sigma-aldrich) and
stored at ⫺70°c. aliquots were thawed and diluted into medium immediately before addition to lymphocyte cultures. the final concentration of
dmso in the cell culture medium was 0.1%. the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar)-␥ agonist ciglitazone was purchased from cayman chemical, whereas 9- xxxd2404xxx ,  xxxd3417xxx , 1␣,25dihydroxyvitamin d3, 3,3⬘,5-triiodo-l-thyronine,  xxxd1660xxx   xxxd3479xxx ,

for reporter gene analysis, the cat reporter plasmid a1/l-cat, containing 2 kb of genomic dna cloned from immediately upstream of the
bcl2a1a gene (39), was provided by s. gerondakis (the royal melbourne
hospital, parkville, victoria, australia) and cloned in a luciferase reporter
plasmid ( xxxg2041xxx /bcl2a1). the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)-␤-galactosidase reporter plasmid was provided by r. modlin (university of california,
los angeles, ca). the expression plasmid for pcmx/rxr␣ and pcmx
were provided by d. mangelsdorf (southwestern medical center,
dallas, tx).
3t3 cells (a murine fibroblast cell line, atcc crl1658) and el4 cells
(a t lymphoma cell line, atcc tib-39) were obtained from the american
type culture collection. raw 264.7 cells (a murine monocytic cell line,
atcc tib-71) were a gift from dr. d. hwang (u.s. department of ag-

riculture western human nutrition research center, university of california, davis, ca).

cell culture
for microarray analysis, t lymphocytes were isolated and stimulated as
described in two independent experiments (12). briefly, cd4⫹ cells were
purified from rag1⫺/⫺ do11.10 mice by positive selection using cd4specific magnetic beads (dynal biotech). these cells were stimulated with
ova323–339 peptide (alpha diagnostics international) and irradiated
splenocytes from balb/c mice as apcs. cultures were treated with the
rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  (10 nm in 0.1% dmso) or 0.1% dmso (vehicle control). for rna extraction and microarray analysis cd4⫹/kj1–
26⫹ t lymphocytes were sorted to ⬎96% purity using a moflo (dakocytomation) high-speed cell sorter.
three independent experiments were done to confirm the microarray
results and to determine whether cytokines regulating th1/th2 development affected expression of putative rxr-responsive genes identified in
the microarray experiments. these experiments were done as just described
with the following treatments: 1)  xxxd1731xxx  (10 nm ⫹ 0.1% dmso)
plus neutralizing abs for il-4, ifn-␥, and il-12 (5 ␮g/ml of each ab); 2)
 xxxd1731xxx  plus isotype control abs (5 ␮g/ml of each ab); 3) vehicle
control (0.1% dmso) plus neutralizing abs; 4) vehicle control plus isotype control abs; and 5) il-4 (10 ng/ml ⫹ 0.1% dmso).
in other experiments, cd4⫹ cells were purified from draining lymph
nodes and spleens of rag1⫺/⫺ do11.10 mice by positive selection using
cd4-specific magnetic beads and then stimulated with plate-bound anticd3 (1 ␮g/ml; clone 145-2c11; bd pharmingen) and anti-cd28 added to
the medium (5 ␮g/ml; clone 37.51; bd pharmingen). culture conditions
have been described previously (12).
the th1 and th2 cell cultures were stimulated every 2 wk with
ova323–339 peptide ag and irradiated splenocytes plus added il-2 (50
u/ml). culture conditions have been described previously (12).

mrna analysis
dna microarray analysis. microarray analysis was done twice, using
rna from two independent experiments. rna quality and integrity was
determined using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (agilent technologies) and
absorbance at a260/a280. only high-quality rna, having a 28s/18s
rrna ratio of 1.5:2 and an a260/280 ratio of 1.8:2, was used for further
experimentation. rna was converted to double-stranded cdna and to
biotin-labeled crna by in vitro transcription labeling with a highyield
bioarray rna transcript labeling kit (enzo biochem). the quality of in
vitro transcription and fragmentation products was assessed using the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer.
we used the u74av2 murine oligonucleotide arrays (affymetrix) that
contain 12,488 probes representing 5,890 genes. fifteen micrograms of
fragmented, biotin-labeled crna was hybridized at 45°c overnight as defined in the affymetrix7 expression analysis protocol. the hybridization
buffer contained 100 mm mes, 1 m nacl, 20 mm edta, 0.01% tween
20, four eukaryotic hybridization controls (1.5 pm biob, 5 pm bioc, 25
pm biod, and 100 pm cre), 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm dna (promega), and
0.5 mg/ml acetylated bsa. after hybridization, the arrays were washed
and stained with an affymetrix fluidic station following the ab amplification washing and staining protocol (affymetrix). hybridization was detected with streptavidin-pe and a confocal laser scanner (affymetrix).
pcr analysis. qualitative pcr analysis to confirm rar and rxr expression, and quantitative pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis to compare levels of
gene expression were done as described previously (12). primers are described in table i and were developed using  xxxg873xxx  software (genetics
computer group). primers used for  xxxg250xxx  for were purchased from biosource international. qrt-pcr was performed using a lightcycler rapid
thermal cycler system with sybr green i dye (roche diagnostic systems). rna quality for qrt-pcr analysis was assessed as described for
microarray analysis. melting curve analysis was used to confirm specificity
of the products. products were cloned and sequenced during assay development to confirm specificity.

apoptosis analysis
apoptotic cells were identified using flow cytometric analysis of cells
stained with pe-labeled  xxxg166xxx  to identify apoptotic cells and 7-aminoactinomycin d (7-aad) to label permeable (dead) cells (bd pharmingen), and staining was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using a facscalibur flow cytometer (bd pharmingen). apoptosis assays
were performed on cd4-selected naive t lymphocytes stimulated with
 xxxd2676xxx  and anti-cd28 ab. in one experiment, these reagents were used
to sort viable, nonapoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫺/7-aad⫺) from viable, apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹/7-aad⫺) using a moflo high-speed cell sorter.

as well as thymocytes (25). thymocyte apoptosis has also been
reduced by  xxxd3417xxx  treatment (26). however, in t lymphoma
cells,  xxxd3417xxx  has been shown to induce apoptosis, although
the mechanism is not known (27). to our knowledge, the effects of
retinoids on apoptosis have not been examined in primary t
lymphocytes.
in the present study, we have identified genes that are differentially regulated by the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  during primary
antigenic stimulation of naive cd4⫹ t lymphocytes from
rag1⫺/⫺ do11.10 tcr-transgenic mice (28). many genes playing a role in apoptosis were identified. one of these was bcl2a1,
which encodes the antiapoptotic  xxxg250xxx  family member a1 (also
called bfl-1 and hbpa1) (29). bcl2a1 is expressed in many cells of
the immune system, including myeloid progenitor cells (30), macrophages (31), neutrophils (32), thymocytes (13), t lymphocytes
(33), and b lymphocytes (34). in t lymphocytes, bcl2a1 expression is induced by engagement of the tcr (17) via activation of
nf-␬b (17, 34, 35). our data suggest that rxr agonists enhance
survival of naive t lymphocytes by increasing bcl2a1 gene expression and thereby decreasing apoptosis.

to determine the purity after sorting, some cells were collected into  xxxg166xxx  binding buffer (bd pharmingen) to retain binding of  xxxg166xxx .
sorted cells were ⬎90% pure.

western blots
cells were washed in cold pbs containing 0.5 mm pmsf before protein
extraction. whole-cell protein extracts were prepared as follows: washed
cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% nonidet p-40, 30 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 0.5 mm edta (ph 8.0), 150 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm
pmsf, and 1/500 dilution of protease inhibitor solution) and were incubated for 5 min on ice. the protease inhibitor solution consisted of one
complete protease inhibitor tablet (roche diagnostic systems) dissolved in
250 ␮l of water. a total of 5 m nacl was added to a final concentration of
400 mm, and cells were incubated for an additional 10 min on ice. cells
were then passed through a qiashredder (qiagen) by centrifugation for 10
min at 20,800 ⫻ g at 4°c. nuclear extracts were prepared as follows:
washed cells were resuspended in 100 ␮l of solution a (0.5% nonidet
p-40, 10 mm hepes (ph 7.9), 1.5 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm kcl) per
million cells and incubated for 5 min on ice. samples were then pelleted by
centrifugation at 6800 ⫻ g at 4°c for 5 min. the pellet was resuspended
in 25 ␮l of solution b (20 mm hepes (ph 7.9), 25% glycerol, 400 mm
nacl, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm edta (ph 8), 0.2 mm pmsf, 0.5 mm
dtt, and 1/500 dilution of protease inhibitor solution) per million cells.
samples were frozen and thawed three times and passed through a
qiashredder as described above.
proteins were resolved by sds-page on 4 –12% gradient gels (novex)
and transferred to nitrocellulose (invitrogen life technologies). blots were
blocked using 10% skim milk powder in pbs containing 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (sigma-aldrich) (pbst) overnight at 4°c.
blots were washed three times with pbst and were blocked again in 5%
goat serum (jackson immunoresearch laboratories) in pbst overnight at
room temperature. each blot was then probed using appropriate abs diluted at 1/500 at room temperature for 1.5 h and washed three times with
pbst. after washing, the secondary ab diluted at 1/20,000 was added and
incubation lasted another 1.5 h at room temperature. finally, the blots were
washed three times with pbst and developed using the ecl kit (amersham biosciences).

reporter gene analysis
cell lines were maintained in dmem (invitrogen life technologies) supplemented with 10% fbs (fcs) (invitrogen life technologies) and 1⫻
antibioticum/antimycoticum (invitrogen life technologies) at 37°c in a
5% co2/air environment. cells for reporter assays were seeded in 24-well
plates at a density of 1.5–2.0 ⫻ 105 cells/well 1 day prior transient cotransfections. before transfection, the growth medium was replaced with
dmem, supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fbs. per well,
3t3 cells were transfected with 500 ng of pcmx or pcmx/rxr␣, 400 ng

of  xxxg2041xxx -basic/bcl2a1, and 200 ng of hsp70-␤-galactosidase reporter plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen life technologies), following
the manufacturer’s instructions; raw 264.2 cells were transfected in the
same way with 500 ng of pcmx or pcmx/rxr␣, 800 ng of  xxxg2041xxx -basic/
bcl2a1, and 400 ng of hsp70-␤-galactosidase reporter plasmid. twentyfour hours after transfections, the cells were treated with dmso,  xxxd3417xxx ,
or agn 194204 at 1 ␮m or at a range from 1 nm to 10 ␮m. twenty-four
hours after treatment, the cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (promega). luciferase and ␤-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined
using luciferase assay system and ␤-galactosidase enzyme systems (promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. luciferase activity was
determined by a td-20/20 luminometer (turner designs); ␤-galactosidase activity was assayed using an elx800 universal microplate reader
(bio-tek instruments).

statistical analysis
microarray analysis. microarray suite 5.0 (affymetrix) was used to determine the probe intensities and to compare expression among different
arrays; the average intensity for each array was normalized by scaling to a
target median intensity value of 125. the gene expression values were log
transformed (log base 2). genes were ranked on t test scores, p values ( p ⬍
0.05), and fold changes computed as actual expression values. a particular
transcript was considered significantly differentially expressed between the
groups if it had a fold change ⬎ 1.29 (rxr agonist vs vehicle control or
vice versa) and a value of p ⬍ 0.05, and this finding was concordant in the
two independent experiments. the cutoff of ⬎1.29 was selected because
previous quantitative rt-pcr analysis (12) showed that changes of this
magnitude in th2-enhancing genes (il-4 and gata-3) were both statistically significant and predicted later development of a th2 phenotype. the
annotation of the differentially expressed genes was performed using information from the affymetrix and national center for biotechnology information entrezgene web sites.
other statistical analysis. statistical analysis was performed using sigmastat for windows 2.03 or 3.1 (spss). multiple comparisons of rna
levels determined by rt-pcr and percentage of apoptotic cells were made
using several methods. paired student’s t tests were used to control for
experiment or time within an experiment when comparing retinoid treatments. one-way anova was used to compare retinoid treatments within
a particular experiment. two-way anova was used to compare retinoid
treatments while controlling for the experiment when results from multiple
experiments were pooled for analysis. three-way anova was also used
to control for experiment when comparing two treatment variables, such as
retinoid treatment and partner ligand treatment, or cytokine treatment and
retinoid treatment. two-way repeated-measure anova was used to compare retinoid treatments when controlling for time and experiment. duplicates to quadruplicate measurements were made within each experiment,

expression of rar and rxr in cd4⫹ t lymphocytes

rar and rxr expression following primary stimulation of naive
cd4⫹ t lymphocytes
we previously reported that treatment of naive do11.10 t lymphocytes with the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  increases th2 development and early expression of th2-promoting genes (12). to
determine whether expression of rar and rxr were also affected
by this treatment, samples from these experiments were examined

density gradient centrifugation 7–14 days after stimulation with ova323–
339 peptide ag. top panel, expression of rar and rxr mrna was assessed by qualitative pcr in total rna extracted from naive t lymphocytes (cd4). plasmid dna from each gene served as a positive control.
rt-pcr mixes without template served as negative controls for each reaction (⫺). bottom panel, nuclear extracts from naive (th0) do11.10 t
lymphocytes and do11.10 th1 and th2 cells (th1, th2) were analyzed by
western blot analysis. cell lysates containing the appropriate baculovirusexpressed mouse receptor protein were included as a positive control (ctrl).
the protein content of each lane for rar-␣, rar-␥, and rxr-␣ were th0
(3 ␮g), th1 (0.5 ␮g), and th2 (1.5 ␮g); for rxr-␤, 15 ␮g were used for
each cell type.

by qrt-pcr. rna levels for both rar-␣ and rar-␥ decreased
after antigenic stimulation (fig. 2). no differences among the three
treatments (rxr agonist, vehicle control, il-4) were seen for
rar-␥, but rar-␣ rna levels were higher in the il-4 treatment
than in the vehicle control (fig. 2). although both rxr-␣ and
rxr-␤ mrna levels were higher in the il-4 treatment than in the
vehicle control after stimulation (fig. 2), treatment with the rxr
agonist did not have a consistent effect on rar or rxr
expression.
dna microarray analysis following primary stimulation of naive
cd4⫹ t lymphocytes
comparison of cultures treated with the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx 
(100 nm) or vehicle control (0.1% dmso) revealed differential
expression of 128 genes (table ii), 108 of which have a known
function. when examined by functional category, regulation of
cell growth and apoptosis encompassed the greatest number of
genes (16 of 108 ⫽ 15%), followed by regulation of transcription
(10 of 108 ⫽ 9%). other functional groups (table ii) were represented at ⬍7%/group.
several genes known to be directly regulated by rxr homo- or
heterodimers were identified. for example, mrna levels of the
 xxxg2014xxx  1 ( xxxg2014xxx ) gene are increased by both rar
and rxr agonists (42). in this analysis, the mean fold-increases
for  xxxg2014xxx  rna was 17.1 (table ii). the  xxxg512xxx  ( xxxg512xxx ) gene, which contains prototypical direct
repeat (dr)1 and dr2 response elements and is up-regulated by
both rar and rxr agonists (43), showed the greatest increase of
all genes 24-fold (table ii and fig. 3). these observations confirm
that genes regulated by rar and rxr can be identified from these
experiments.
this microarray analysis also confirmed our previous observations (12) that rna levels for th2-enhancing genes are increased
by treatment with the rxr agonist. in this analysis, these included
genes for il-4 (1.9-fold), gata3 (1.5-fold), il-4r␣-chain (1.4fold), and growth factor independent (gfi-1) (1.3-fold), although
mrna for il-13 was decreased (⫺2.8-fold). mrna levels for
genes involved in th1 growth and development were decreased by
treatment with the rxr agonist, including il-2 (⫺1.4-fold),  xxxg1174xxx ␣-chain (⫺1.4-fold), and il-12r␤1- (⫺1.4-fold) and il12r-␤2 chains (⫺1.8-fold).
the high percentage of cell growth and apoptosis genes identified in this analysis was of interest for two reasons. first, retinoids
are known to regulate apoptosis in t lymphocytes, thymocytes,
and t lymphoma cells (7, 21, 44). second, in addition to promoting th2 development, treatment with the rxr agonist
 xxxd1731xxx  during primary antigenic stimulation reproducibly
caused a greater accumulation of viable cells after 1 wk of culture
than did treatment with the vehicle control. in eight independent
experiments the number of viable cells (⫾sd) in the rxr agonist
(10⫺7 or 10⫺8 m), il-4 (10 ng/ml) and vehicle control (0.1%
dmso) treatments were 3.80 ⫾ 2.78, 3.73 ⫾ 1.50, and 2.36 ⫾
1.91 ⫻ 106 cells/ml, respectively. cell counts in the rxr and il-4
treatment groups were both significantly greater than the counts in
the vehicle control ( p ⫽ 0.032 and p ⫽ 0.024, respectively, by
paired student’s t test), while the rxr agonist and il-4 treatments
did not differ from one another ( p ⫽ 0.92). the mean fold increases for the rxr and il-4 treatments were 2.24 and 2.37,
respectively.
because treatment with the rxr agonist increases cell number,
we examined differential expression of cell growth and apoptosis
genes in more detail. the expression of bcl2a1 mrna (table ii;
fig. 3) was significantly greater in cultures treated with
 xxxd1731xxx  than in the vehicle control cultures (⬃2-fold). bcl2a1

treatment of naive cd4⫹ t lymphocytes from do11.10 mice
with rar and rxr agonists affects th1/th2 memory cell development (12, 40, 41). therefore, we wished to determine which
rar and rxr receptors are expressed in naive or memory cd4⫹
t lymphocytes from these mice. using qualitative pcr analysis of
cdna, we detected a single band of appropriate size for rar-␣,
rar-␥, rxr-␣, and rxr-␤ in naive do11.10 cd4⫹ t lymphocytes (fig. 1, top panel) and in th1 and th2 cells derived from
do11.10 mice (data not shown). the cdna sequences of these
products were essentially identical to the published sequences for
these receptors. western blot analysis of nuclear extracts found
that rar-␣, rxr-␣, and rxr-␤ but not rar-␤, rar-␥, or
rxr-␥ were present in naive cd4⫹ t lymphocytes as well as in
the th1 and th2 cultures (fig. 1, bottom panel). although rar-␥
mrna was found at levels similar to the other receptors, protein
was not seen in either whole cell or nuclear extracts.

rxr agonists increase bcl2a1 expression

also stood out because of the high signal intensity for the two
bcl2a1 probe sets (third and fourth highest of all differentially
expressed genes). these two probe sets represent the genes
bcl2a1b and bcl2a1d, two members of a family of four genes (also
including bcl2a1a and bcl2a1c, although the latter gene is not
expressed) that code for the b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2-related
protein a1 (45). these genes have high sequence identity and are
 xxxg250xxx  family members. as with  xxxg250xxx , the bcl2a1 protein acts at the
mitochondrial level to prevent apoptosis and is known to be expressed and protective against apoptosis in naive t lymphocytes
undergoing primary ag stimulation (33).

 xxxg512xxx  mrna levels were also analyzed in this experiment to
confirm transcriptional activity of the rxr agonist (fig. 4). mean
 xxxg512xxx  rna levels following treatment were also higher compared with the levels of dmso-treated cells either in the presence
( p ⬍ 0.001, fold increase ⫽ 4.11) or in the absence ( p ⬍ 0.001;
fold increase ⫽ 5.58) of the cytokine-neutralizing abs. treatment
with the rxr agonist produced no consistent, statistically significant differences in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( xxxg1075xxx ) mrna levels either in the presence or absence of
neutralizing ab (fig. 4). this result was also consistent with our
microarray studies (fig. 3).

rxr-stimulated increase in bcl2a1 is independent of il-4, il12, and ifn-␥ stimulation

time course of bcl2a1 rna expression: effect of  xxxd1731xxx 
and 9- xxxd2404xxx 

to confirm the microarray results, we examined bcl2a1 gene expression by qrt-pcr using primers that detect all bcl2a1 family
members. in addition, because treatment with  xxxd1731xxx  and
other retinoids affect th1/th2 cytokine production (12), neutralizing abs for il-4, il-12, and ifn-␥ were included in some cultures to determine whether rxr-mediated increases in bcl2a1 expression were independent of effects on these cytokines (fig. 4).
the mean bcl2a1 mrna levels in the  xxxd1731xxx  treatment
groups was greater than in the vehicle control groups either in the
presence ( p ⬍ 0.001, fold increase ⫽ 1.83) or in the absence ( p ⬍
0.001, fold increase ⫽ 2.38) of the cytokine-neutralizing abs (fig.
4). treatment of cultures with il-4 did not enhance bcl2a1 expression (fig. 4). these results are consistent with the findings
from the microarray studies and also indicate that rxr-induced
increases in bcl2a1 mrna occur independent of il-4, il-12, and
ifn-␥ stimulation.

the expression of bcl2a1 is induced in t lymphocytes by stimulation via the tcr complex. expression peaks before 24 h and
then decreases by 48 h (17, 46). purified cd4⫹ do11.10 t lymphocytes were stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  plus anti-cd28 ab in the
presence of  xxxd1731xxx , the natural rxr agonist 9-cis-retinoic
acid (100 nm), or vehicle control (0.1% dmso). bcl2a1 mrna
levels were greatest at 20 h in cells treated with vehicle only (fig.
5). the pattern was similar following retinoid treatments.
 xxxd1731xxx  significantly increased bcl2a1 expression at both
20 h (41% higher) and 44 h (38% higher). the effect of 9-cisretinoic acid on bcl2a1 expression was similar to that of
 xxxd1731xxx  (fig. 5), although the magnitude of the effect was
less. at 20 and 44 h following 9- xxxd2404xxx  treatment, the
increases in bcl2a1 expression over the vehicle control were 23
and 42%, respectively ( p ⫽ 0.027, paired t test).  xxxg512xxx  rna
expression was examined as a positive control for the retinoid

rxr agonists increase bcl2a1 expression

treatments. both treatments significantly increased  xxxg512xxx  expression over levels seen in the vehicle control (fig. 5).
effect of rxr partner ligands on bcl2a1 rna expression
rxr may regulate bcl2a1 expression by forming a heterodimer
with a permissive partner receptor. such receptors include the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr,  xxxg2412xxx ), thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (tr,
 xxxg966xxx ),  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr,  xxxg1597xxx ), liver x receptor
(lxr, nr1h), rar (nr1b), ppar (nr1c) (47). thus, treatment of t lymphocytes with the partner ligand alone might increase bcl2a1 expression. to test this hypothesis, cultures of naive
cd4⫹ do11.10 t lymphocytes were stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx 
and anti-cd28 abs and treated with partner-receptor ligands (100
nm 1,25(oh)2  xxxd1682xxx , 100 nm 3,3⬘,5-tri-iodothyronine, 50
␮m  xxxd1660xxx   xxxd3479xxx , 5 ␮m 22(r)-hydroxycholesterol, 100
nm  xxxd3417xxx , and 100 nm ciglitazone) in the presence
the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  (100 nm) or vehicle control (0.1%
dmso). in four independent experiments, treatment with
 xxxd1731xxx  alone significantly increased bcl2a1 expression
above the level seen with the vehicle control, as was expected, but
none of the partner ligands used alone significantly increased
bcl2a1 expression (data not shown). treatment with each partner
ligand in combination with the rxr agonist also significantly increased bcl2a1 expression above the level seen with the vehicle
control, but none of these combinations significantly increased
bcl2a1 expression above the level seen with  xxxd1731xxx  alone
(data not shown). thus, these ligands for vdr, tr, fxr, lxr,
rar, and ppar-␥ do not increase bcl2a1 mrna under these
experimental conditions.
rxr agonist decreases t lymphocyte apoptosis following
primary stimulation
because bcl2a1 inhibits apoptotic death of naive t lymphocytes
following antigenic stimulation, we anticipated that treatment of
stimulated t lymphocytes with  xxxd1731xxx  would also decrease

figure 4. mrna expression of bcl2a1,  xxxg512xxx , and  xxxg1075xxx  measured
by qrt-pcr in naive do11.10 t lymphocytes sorted to ⬎96% purity 64 h
following primary antigenic stimulation with irradiated splenocytes and
ova323–339 peptide ag. at the time of antigenic stimulation, cultures were
treated with the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  (10 nm in 0.1% dmso) or
vehicle control (0.1% dmso) either with neutralizing abs for il-4, ifn-␥,
and il-12 (neutralizing abs) or with isotype control abs (5 ␮g/ml each) or
with il-4 (10 ng/ml). results are the mean (⫾se) from three independent
experiments. two-way anova comparing rna levels for the rxr agonist vs vehicle control within ab treatments showed that rna levels for
the rxr agonist treatment were greater than for the vehicle control for
bcl2a1 and  xxxg512xxx  for both ab treatments (p ⬍ 0.001). neither difference
was significant (p ⬎ 0.05) for  xxxg1075xxx  rna.

apoptosis. to test this hypothesis we treated cd4⫹ do11.10 t
lymphocytes (stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  and anti-cd28 ab) with
the rxr agonist  xxxd1731xxx  or vehicle control (0.1% dmso),
stained cells with pe-labeled  xxxg166xxx  and 7-aad, and analyzed
cells by flow cytometry. the percentage of cells positive for both
 xxxg166xxx  and 7-aad was lower in the rxr agonist-treated cultures at all time points. these differences were statistically significant by two-way anova at 24 h ( p ⬍ 0.001, n ⫽ 3 experiments)
and 48 h ( p ⬍ 0.001, n ⫽ 3 experiments) but not at 72 h (n ⫽ 2

and the median (25th, 75th percentile) was 279 (142, 518). the bcl2a1b,

apoptosis in cultures treated with the rxr agonist at both 48 and
72 h ( p ⬍ 0.001) (fig. 6, bottom panel). thus, treatment with the
rxr agonist decreased apoptosis of naive t lymphocytes during
initial stimulation via the tcr with cd28-mediated costimulation.
growth factor deficiency may contribute to apoptosis of t lymphocytes following antigenic stimulation. to determine whether
growth factor deficiency was a factor in these experiments, we
measured the effect of  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  on apoptosis 48 h after stimulation in the presence of il-2 or il-4 or
without cytokine. the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was
highest without cytokine (43.6%), significantly lower with il-2 treatment (41.4%) and (significantly) lower still with il-4 treatment
(37.2%) (fig. 7). both  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  significantly decreased the percentage of cells that were positive for both
 xxxg166xxx  and 7-aad with our without cytokine treatment (fig. 7).
thus, the effect of these rxr agonists on protection from apoptosis
is independent of treatment with il-2 and il-4.
effect of  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  on  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx 
expression
because  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx  are antiapoptotic genes that act in a manner similar to bcl2a1, we examined the effect of retinoid treatment
on their expression in stimulated t lymphocyte cultures (fig. 5).
 xxxg250xxx  expression was highest at 2 h and decreased steadily through
20 and 44 h, but the rxr agonists  xxxd1731xxx  and 9-cis-retinoic

acid had no significant effects on  xxxg250xxx  expression.  xxxg251xxx  expression was lowest at 2 h, increased by 20 h, and then decreased
slightly by 44 h. neither rxr agonist significantly affected  xxxg251xxx 
expression (fig. 5). thus, these rxr agonists did not affect expression of the antiapoptotic genes  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx .
bcl2a1 rna expression is higher in nonapoptotic than apoptotic
t lymphocytes
given the direct effect of bcl2a1 on protection from apoptosis in
naive t lymphocytes (17), we anticipated that bcl2a1 mrna levels would be higher in nonapoptotic than in apoptotic cells (i.e., the
ratio in sorted cells would be ⬎1.0). to confirm this expectation,
we stimulated naive do11.10 t lymphocytes with  xxxd2676xxx  and
anti-cd28 abs, separated viable, nonapoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫺/
7-aad⫺) from viable, apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹/7-aad⫺) by
cell sorting, and measured bcl2a1 expression by qrt-pcr 24, 48,
and 72 h after stimulation. cultures were treated with  xxxd1731xxx 
(100 nm) or vehicle control (0.1% dmso), and one sample from
each treatment was sorted and analyzed at each time point. the
overall mean ratio (⫾sd) of bcl2a1 mrna levels in nonapoptotic
vs apoptotic cells was 3.97 ⫾ 1.20 (n ⫽ 6), significantly greater
than 1.0 ( p ⫽ 0.002 by paired student’s t test controlling for time
point). the ratios increased over time (2.8, 4.4, and 4.7 at 24, 48,
and 72 h) but did not differ by retinoid treatment. thus, nonapoptotic cells from both treatments had higher bcl2a1 expression than

cd4⫹ t lymphocytes were purified by positive selection from rag⫺/⫺ do11.10 mice. cells were treated with the rxr agonists  xxxd1731xxx  (100 nm
in 0.1% dmso), 9- xxxd2404xxx  (100 nm in 0.1% dmso), or vehicle (0.1% dmso) and stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  and anti-cd28 ab at 0 h. rna
was extracted at 2, 20, and 44 h, and mrna levels were determined using qrt-pcr. each data point represents the mean ⫾ se from five independent
experiments. two-way repeated measures anova of all treatments and time points was used to determine whether the retinoid treatments differed
significantly from the vehicle control. significant differences (p ⬍ 0.05) for the  xxxd1731xxx  treatment were seen for  xxxg512xxx  (p ⫽ 0.005) and bcl2a1 (p ⫽

expression ratios were found between nonapoptotic and apoptotic
cells (mean ratio 1.06 ⫾ 0.44, p ⫽ 0.74), as would be expected for
a gene not known to be involved in apoptosis.
 xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  increase transcription from
the bcl2a1 promoter
because both  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  increased
bcl2a1 mrna levels in stimulated t lymphocytes, we wished to
determine whether the 5⬘-regulatory region of bcl2a1 responds
directly to treatment with these rxr agonists. therefore, we examined the effects of  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  on the
ability of 2.0 kb of genomic dna found immediately upstream of
the bcl2a1 structural gene to regulate expression of a luciferase
reporter gene. this region contains several transcription factor
binding sites or importance to regulation of bcl2a1 gene expression (39). because the effect of retinoids on transcription may vary
by cell type, we initially attempted to transfect this reporter construct into primary t lymphocytes and a t lymphocyte line (el4).

efficiencies were very low (data not shown) so we used murine
macrophage (raw) and fibroblast (3t3) cell lines.
in both raw and 3t3 cells, we found that luciferase activity was
increased significantly by treatment with either  xxxd1731xxx  or 9-cisretinoic acid. as shown in fig. 8, 9- xxxd2404xxx  increased luciferase activity by 103% in raw cells and 91% in 3t3 cells. when an
expression plasmid for rxr-␣ was cotransfected with the reporter
plasmid, basal expression in the raw and 3t3 cells was 70 and 416%
higher than without the expression plasmid. addition of 9-cis-retinoic
acid again increased luciferase activity in the presence of the reporter
plasmid by 136% in raw cells and by 103% in 3t3 cells. the effect
of different concentrations of 9- xxxd2404xxx  and  xxxd1731xxx  on
transcriptional activity was assessed in 3t3 cells. both retinoids
showed an ability to increase luciferase activity at low concentrations
(1 nm for 9- xxxd2404xxx  and 10 nm for  xxxd1731xxx ) and a doseresponse effect was seen at higher concentrations, with the maximum
increase being 94% for 9- xxxd2404xxx  and 52% for  xxxd1731xxx .
thus, the bcl2a1 promoter is responsive to retinoids at physiologically relevant concentrations.

discussion
many nuclear receptors are expressed in t lymphocytes, including
rar, rxr, ppar, vdr, ror-␥ (nr1f3),  xxxg1603xxx  ( xxxg1603xxx ), and
nor1 (nr4a3) (7, 10, 48, 49). in tcr-transgenic do11.10 t
lymphocytes, we detected mrna for rar-␣, rar-␥, rxr-␣,
and rxr-␤. protein was also detected for three of these four receptors, with the exception of rar-␥. it is possible that our western blot analysis was not sensitive enough to detect rar-␥, although rna levels for rar-␣ and rar-␥ were similar. other
investigators report the presence of rar-␥ mrna in t lymphocytes and biological activity for rar-␥-selective ligands (24). to

our knowledge, rar-␥ protein has not been identified in t lymphocytes by western blot analysis, thus the significance of rar-␥
rna levels in these cells remains uncertain.
rar mrna levels decreased after antigenic stimulation while
rxr mrna levels increased (with il-4 treatment) or remained
stable, suggesting a requirement for rxr-mediated signaling in
developing memory t lymphocytes. increased rxr-␣ expression
has also been reported following tcr stimulation in proliferating
human t lymphocytes (50), although stimulation of resting human
t lymphocytes decreases rxr-␣ mrna and protein levels (51).
the latter situation is more analogous to the present study, although our murine, tcr-transgenic t lymphocytes were activated
with apcs and specific ag, rather than the polyclonal stimulation
used in the studies of resting, human peripheral blood t lymphocytes. this difference in stimulation, or the many differences between these murine and human culture systems, may account for
the differences in rxr-␣ expression seen between the two studies.
our microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of
many genes involved in th1/th2 development, cell proliferation,
and cell survival were regulated by rxr in naive t lymphocytes
during primary antigenic stimulation. regulation of these genes
may occur directly or indirectly. many genes directly regulated by
rxr agonists, including  xxxg512xxx  and  xxxg2014xxx , were identified in these
experiments. although many microarray studies use cell lines,
which may not adequately represent the same cell type in vivo, or
use tissues from treated animals, which contain many cell types,
our study used primary cells that were purified to ⬎96% homogeneity before rna extraction. thus, we have a high degree of
confidence that the genes identified by this method are expressed
in primary t lymphocytes and that differences in mrna levels
reflect actual differences in gene expression in these cells, rather
than differences in frequencies of cells in a mixed population.
one of the genes induced by  xxxd1731xxx  in our microarray
studies was bcl2a1. this gene is induced by tcr stimulation (33)
and treatment with  xxxd1731xxx  enhanced bcl2a1 expression

above levels seen by tcr stimulation alone, using either apcs
and peptide ag or ant-cd3 plus anti-cd28 abs. rar and rxr
agonists can also affect expression of il-12 by apcs and of il-4
and ifn-␥ by t lymphocytes (2). however, neutralizing abs were
used to rule out an effect of these cytokines on bcl2a1 expression
in our experiments. because  xxxd1731xxx  is a synthetic agonist,
we also tested the naturally occurring rxr agonist 9-cis-retinoic
acid for the ability to increase bcl2a1 rna expression. 9- xxxd2404xxx  also increased bcl2a1 mrna levels, although the magnitude of the response was not as great as seen with equal concentrations of  xxxd1731xxx . this may be because the binding
affinity and transactivation activity (ec50 concentration) are 10fold lower for  xxxd1731xxx  than for 9- xxxd2404xxx  (38), making  xxxd1731xxx  a more potent agonist. these results confirm that
bcl2a1 mrna levels are greater in primary t lymphocyte cultures
treated with rxr agonists, and are consistent with an rxr-mediated increase in transcription.
to determine whether  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  directly regulate transcription from the bcl2a1 promoter, we conducted experiments using a luciferase reporter construct containing
2.0 kb of cloned genomic dna from the 5⬘ noncoding region of
the bcl2a1a gene (39). these experiments confirmed that both
 xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx  increased luciferase activity in
3t3 and raw cells. to our knowledge, these are the first data to
directly indicate that retinoids regulate bcl2a1 gene expression.
additional experiments will be needed to determine how these
agonists affect transcription. it is possible that an rxr homodimer
or heterodimer binds to an appropriate response element in the
bcl2a1 promoter and thereby enhance transcription (52). preliminary examination of the bcl2a1 promoter revealed a nearly canonical dr4 element (data not shown), but agonists for two nuclear receptors that typically act via a dr4 element, tr and lxr,
did not significantly enhance bcl2a1 expression in the present
study, nor did the ligands for ppar-␥, fxr, rar, or vdr enhance bcl2a1 expression. these negative results suggest that these

in the first 24 h following stimulation than decreases to basal levels
within 3 days, while bcl2a1 protein is detectable on days 1 through 3,
with a peak on day 2 (17, 46). transgenic expression of bcl2a1a using
the lck promoter (which is stimulated by activation of the tcr)
enhances survival of stimulated t lymphocytes for at least 3 days
(46). these findings are similar to our observations that rxr agonists
prolong bcl2a1 expression 2 and 3 days after stimulation, with corresponding decreases in apoptosis. our observation that expression of
rna for  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx  was not increased by retinoid treatment
supports our hypothesis that rxr agonists diminish apoptosis by increasing bcl2a1 expression. additional experiments to block bcl2a1
expression or function following rxr stimulation will be needed to
confirm this hypothesis.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that rxr agonists increase bcl2a1 expression, decrease apoptosis, and increase cell
number following primary antigenic stimulation of naive cd4⫹ t
lymphocytes. in addition, these agonists induce the transcriptional
activity of bcl2a1 using a luciferase reporter gene. thus, rxr
appears to promote the survival of t lymphocytes during initial
exposure to ag. retinoids may be pro- or antiapoptotic, depending
on the type of cell involved, with proapoptotic effects often being
seen in transformed cells (63), including t cell lymphomas (27). in
the present experiments, rxr ligands play an antiapoptotic role,
as has been seen recently for rxr and lxr in macrophages during antibacterial responses (64). thus, ligands for rxr appear to
promote cell survival during the initiation and effector phases of
both innate and adaptive immune responses. this role should be of
benefit in fighting infectious diseases but may be a mixed blessing
during chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease when increased cell survival may mean more severe disease. further work
is needed on the specific mechanisms of action of rxr and its
partner receptors to understand how the immune response may be
modified by dietary and pharmacologic ligands for these receptors.

partner receptors are not involved in regulation of bcl2a1 expression. however, the results are not definitive because these experiments were conducted using cell culture medium containing fbs,
which may contain partner ligands (e.g.,  xxxd3417xxx  or
thyroid hormone) that could obscure enhancement of bcl2a1 expression by added partner ligands.
rather than bind to a response element, rxr could interact
directly with transcription factors, such as nf-␬b, and thereby
affect transcription (53). this is plausible because bcl2a1 transcription is regulated by nf-␬b (35), but such interactions often
result in decreased rather than increased transcription as a result of
competition among different transcription factors for access to the
transcription complex. however, a recent study revealed that retinoids induced apoptosis via an rar-␣/rxr pathway in immature
dendritic cells. but when dendritic cells were also stimulated with
inflammatory signals cell survival, maturation, and ag presentation were enhanced. the latter effects depended on rxr were
independent of rar and appeared to be mediated by increased
nuclear translocation of nf-␬b (54). because bcl2a1 transcription is
increased by nf-␬b binding to its promoter following tcr engagement (39), the same rxr-mediated enhancement of nf-␬b activity
could be responsible for increased bcl2a1 expression in the present
experiments. further work is needed to address this hypothesis.
previous studies have found that  xxxd3417xxx  increases
bcl2a1 mrna levels and decreases apoptosis in the nb4 and
pbl985 acute  xxxg1785xxx  cell lines (55–58). in a more
recent study with pbl985 cells, 9- xxxd2404xxx  increased bcl2a1
expression but the rxr-selective agonist sr11237 did not (59).
these results are consistent with our findings that 9- xxxd2404xxx 
increased bcl2a1 mrna levels in both the leukemia cell lines and in
primary t lymphocytes. however, in the present study,  xxxd3417xxx  did not increase bcl2a1 mrna without coadministration of
 xxxd1731xxx . it is possible that rar was not expressed at a sufficient
level to mediate these effects in our experiments as expression decreased after antigenic stimulation. in addition, the profile of coactivator and corepressor proteins undoubtedly differs between  xxxg1785xxx  cells and primary cd4⫹ t lymphocytes. such
differences could account for the disparate results with rar and rxr
agonists between these two sets of experiments.
different mechanisms regulate t lymphocyte survival and loss
during the different phases of the immune response. during the
postactivation phase, stimulated t lymphocytes are susceptible to
activation-induced cell death by restimulation via the tcr. apoptosis can then be induced by binding of  xxxd3135xxx  to fas expressed on the surface of susceptible cells. t cell hybridomas are
used as models of activation-induced cell death (18). in this system,  xxxd3417xxx  inhibits fas-mediated apoptosis by decreasing
cell surface  xxxd3135xxx  expression (19 –22). however, this mechanism is of limited importance following primary antigenic stimulation as naive t lymphocytes are resistant to activation-induced
cell death (18, 46).
survival of naive t lymphocytes during the first few days following primary stimulation is enhanced by several factors, including the
activity of growth-promoting cytokines such as il-2 and il-4 (15,
18). although cytokine withdrawal can induce apoptosis and retinoids
are known to affect il-2 production and receptor expression (60, 61),
addition of il-2 and il-4 to cultures in the present studies did not alter
the antiapoptotic effects of  xxxd1731xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx . this
result was not unexpected because these cytokines do not induce
bcl2a1 expression in naive t lymphocytes, although il-4 can induce
 xxxg250xxx  expression (17).
stimulation of naive t lymphocytes via the tcr, with appropriate
costimulation, induces expression of prosurvival  xxxg250xxx  family members bcl2a1 and  xxxg251xxx  (17, 46, 62). bcl2a1 mrna expression peaks
