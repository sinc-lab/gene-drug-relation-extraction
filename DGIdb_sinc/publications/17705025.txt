reduced ability to mobilize glucose from glycogen. six
mutations of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene, which encodes the liver
isoform of the enzyme, have been identified in the
literature. we have characterized eight patients from
seven families with gsd type vi and identified 11 novel
 xxxg1909xxx  gene defects. the majority of the mutations
were missense, resulting in the substitution of highly
conserved residues. these could be grouped into those
that were predicted to affect substrate binding
(p.v456m, p.e673k, p.s675l, p.s675t), pyridoxal
phosphate binding (p.r491c, p.k681t), or activation
of glycogen phosphorylase (p.q13p) or that had an
unknown effect (p.n632i and p.d634h). two mutations were predicted to result in null alleles, p.r399x
and [c.1964_1969inv6;c.1969+1_+4delgtac]. only 7 of
the 23 (30%) reported  xxxg1909xxx  alleles carry nonsense,
splice site or frameshift mutations compared to 68–
80% of affected alleles of the highly homologous
 xxxg1908xxx  gene,  xxxg1910xxx , that
underlie mcardle disease. there was heterogeneity in
the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals.
these varied from hepatomegaly and subclinical hypoglycaemia, to severe hepatomegaly with recurrent severe
hypoglycaemia and postprandial lactic acidosis. we
conclude that deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase
is predominantly the result of missense mutations affecting enzyme activity. there are no common mutations and
the severity of clinical symptoms varies significantly.

introduction

materials and methods

as the principal store of carbohydrate, liver glycogen
has an important role in the maintenance of blood
glucose levels. deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase (ec 2.4.1.1), in  xxxg1909xxx  or glycogen storage
disease (gsd) type vi (omim 232700) results in a
reduced ability to mobilize glucose from glycogen.
deficiency is autosomal recessive with symptoms that
are often indistinguishable from phosphorylase kinase
(ec 2.7.11.19) deficiency in gsd type ix (omim
306000). these are described as generally relatively
mild and include gross hepatomegaly and, in some
cases, hypoglycaemia (lederer and stalmans 1976).
deficiency of the muscle isoform results in mcardle
disease (gsd type v, omim 608455), while deficiency
of the third, brain, isoform has not been identified
(martı́n et al 2001).
liver glycogen phosphorylase, a 184.8 kda homodimer, catalyses the phosphorylytic cleavage of a-1,4glucosidic bonds to release glucose 1-phosphate from
glycogen. the enzyme is principally expressed in liver
with additional isoforms—muscle and brain—predominating in skeletal muscle and brain tissue, respectively (newgard et al 1988). regulation of the liver
isoform occurs through phosphorylation of a serine
residue at position 15 by phosphorylase kinase,
converting inactive  xxxg1908xxx  to the
active a form. phosphorylase kinase is in turn under
the control of hormonal, particularly glucagon, and
neuronal signals. the essential cofactor to glycogen
phosphorylase, pyridoxal 5¶-phosphate (plp) is bound
as a schiff base to a lysine residue within the active
site at position 681 of the 847 residue monomer
(oikonomakos et al 1987).
liver glycogen phosphorylase is encoded by the
 xxxg1909xxx  gene. its 20 exons span 40 kb of the long arm of
chromosome 14 at q21-22 (newgard et al 1987). a
single cdna is transcribed from the  xxxg1909xxx  gene that
shows 73% and 74% identity to the muscle ( xxxg1910xxx 
gene) and brain ( xxxg1908xxx  gene) isoform cdnas,
respectively (newgard et al 1988).
the result of molecular analysis of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene
has been reported in just five patients, in whom six
mutations were described (burwinkel et al 1998;
chang et al 1998; tang et al 2003). we report here
our results from a series of eight patients from seven
families with gsd type vi. we have characterized 11
novel mutations of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene, the majority of
which were missense mutations.

glucose loading
an intravenous glucose loading test (glt) was used
for the differential diagnosis of glycogen storage
disease types 0, iii, vi and ix. following an overnight
fast (minimum 6 h), two independent peripheral vein
catheters were inserted, one for glucose infusion and a
second for blood sampling. glucose (20% w/v) was
given (0.5 g glucose per kg body weight, maximum
25 g) over 3 min. glucose and lactate concentrations
were measured at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60,
75, 90, 120 and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min, respectively.
lactate normal or low at baseline and markedly
increased above 2 mmol/l at between 30 and 60 min
was interpreted as abnormal.
dna analysis
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood
leukocytes using standard procedures. exons and
intron/exon boundaries of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene were
amplified using the pcr from genomic dna samples.
the sequences of the amplification primers can be
obtained from the authors. pcrs were performed in a
volume of 20 ml containing, in the case of amplicons
covering exons 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14–15 and 17, 1
ampligold mastermix (applied biosystems, warrington, uk), 6 pmol of forward and reverse primers and
100 ng dna. for the remaining exons, 20 ml reactions
contained 1 reaction buffer iv (75 mmol/l tris-hcl
(ph8.8 at 25-c), 20 mmol/l (nh4)2so4, 0.01% (v/v)
tween 20 (abgene uk, epsom, uk)), 1.5 mmol/l
mgcl2, 2.5% (v/v) dmso, 250 mmol/l dntps, 6 pmol
of forward and reverse primers, 0.4 units red hot
dna polymerase (abgene) and 100 ng dna. following denaturation for 7 min at 95-c, reactions were
subjected to 35 cycles of 95-c for 30 s, 53-c for 30 s
and 72-c for 1 min, with a final extension step of
7 min. pcr products were purified using exosap-it
(amersham biosciences uk ltd, amersham, bucks,
uk) in a 7 ml volume containing 5 ml pcr product and
0.4 ml of the exonuclease i and shrimp alkaline
phosphatase mixture by incubation at 37-c for
30 min then 80-c for 10 min. between 1.5 ml and 3 ml
of the purified pcr product was sequenced in forward
and reverse directions using the bigdye terminator
v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems) with
primers m13f1 (5¶-cacgacgttgtaaaacgac-3¶)

724

and m13r (5¶-caggaaacagctatgacc-3¶), respectively. twenty-microlitre reactions were precipitated in 70% (v/v) ethanol following supplementation with
3 ml 100 mmol/l edta and 2 ml 3 mol/l naoac ph
4.8, washed twice in 70% ethanol and resuspended in
10 ml hidi formamide (applied biosystems). electrophoresis was performed on an applied biosystems 3730
dna analyzer. electrophoretograms were compared,
using the staden suite of programs, against each other
and against genomic dna sequences from the
ensembl database (ncbi build 35: chromosome 14:
50441394-50481279.1) (bonfield et al 1998). the  xxxg1909xxx 
cdna, (nm_002863.3) was numbered from the a of
the atg, which encodes the initial methionine, defined
as position 1 of the protein. where potential mutations
were identified, freshly amplified pcr product was
re-sequenced to confirm the sequence change. crossspecies conservation was assessed for residues affected
by potential missense mutations using protein sequences from the ensembl database aligned using clustelw
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).
structural analysis of glycogen phosphorylase
the position and interactions of residues affected by
missense mutations within the glycogen phosphorylase
monomer were modelled using coot and pymol
based on rabbit muscle  xxxg1908xxx 
(pdb id: 3gpb) (delano 2002; emsley and cowtan
2004).
analysis of variations in splice sites
the effects on splicing of sequence variations in intron–
exon boundaries were assessed using the spliceview
program on the webgene website (http://www.itb.cnr.it/
sun/webgene/) and the nnsplice 0.9 splice site
prediction software on the berkeley drosophila genome
project website (http://www.fruitfly.org/index.html)
(reese et al 1997; rogozin and milanesi 1997).
case studies
patient 1 is the first child of consanguineous british
asian parents. she presented at 16 months of age with
the parents complaining that she was miserable when
she did not eat. she had hepatomegaly and low weight
(<0.4th centile). liver function tests revealed elevated
transaminases while glt identified pre- and postprandial lactic acidosis. an electrocardiography was

j inherit metab dis (2007) 30:722–734

normal and there was no elevation in plasma creatine
kinase. nocturnal episodes of hypoglycaemia (blood
sugar <3 mmol/l) were treated with corn starch and a
high-carbohydrate diet. treatment resulted in the normalization of liver size and function, glt and weight
(>50th percentile), but at 4.5 years learning difficulties
are suspected. blood cell enzymology was normal (see
table 1) with the exception that the ratio of glycogen
phosphorylase a activity to total phosphorylase activity
was reduced (0.19; normal range 0.42–0.78).
patient 2 is a nonidentical twin, born to nonconsanguineous british caucasian parents. incidental
hepatomegaly was detected when she presented at 5
months of age with vomiting and loose stools, which
subsequently resolved. she had been noted from 6
weeks of age by the parents as having a mildly
distended abdomen. investigations revealed elevated
liver transaminases, triglycerides and lactate, the latter
rising further post-prandially. although she had a
degree of hypotonia, creatine kinase was normal.
fasting tolerance was 9.5 h, maintaining the plasma
glucose above 3 mmol/l. there had been no documented episodes of hypoglycaemia, either clinically or
biochemically. motor development was slightly behind
her unaffected twin, and therefore management was
maximized with an overnight feed and 4-hourly
daytime boluses. liver transaminases and triglycerides
normalized on treatment and the degree of hepatomegaly reduced markedly. developmentally she is
now ahead of her twin. phosphorylase enzyme activities were within the normal range (see table 1).
patients 3 and 4 are brothers born to nonconsanguineous french parents. patient 3 presented at 14
months while patient 4 presented 41=2 years later at 2
years 3 months. both had hepatomegaly, exercise
fatigue, muscle weakness, cramps and short stature.
patient 3 also had splenomegaly. both patients experienced hypoglycaemia which, in patient 4, progressed
to convulsions and has resulted in developmental
delay. upon investigation, transaminases, plasma lipids
and plasma  xxxd3472xxx  were found to be elevated, while
glt identified pre- and post-prandial lactic acidosis in
both brothers. plasma creatine kinase was measured
in patient 3 and found to be within the normal
range. blood cell enzymology was performed at the
same time in the two brothers to reveal significant
reductions in glycogen phosphorylase activity in granulocytes (table 1).
patient 5 was born pre-term as the third child of
nonconsanguineous polish parents. he suffered from
recurrent upper airways infections. allergy was sus-

j inherit metab dis (2007) 30:722–734

pected. he presented at about 12 months with an
enlarged abdomen. hepatomegaly was found at the
age of 25 months. there was no complaint of muscle
abnormalities. biochemical analysis demonstrated
hypertransaminasaemia with slight elevation of triglycerides. levels of cholesterol,  xxxd3472xxx , lactate or
creatine kinase were within normal values. up to
5 years he was short statured (below j2.5 sd), with
further catch-up (probably familial short stature).
liver biopsy was performed at the age of 2 years
5 months in a local hospital. hepatitis protrahens was
suggested. a second biopsy was done at 2 years
7 months and revealed glycogen storage in histological
staining. an intravenous glt showed significant postprandial increase in lactic acid, while blood cell
enzymology was normal (table 1). a third liver biopsy
confirmed glycogen storage on histological staining
and quantitative analysis. enzymology from a liver
sample showed reduced phosphorylase a activity
(table 1).
patient 6 is the first child of nonconsanguineous
polish parents. he presented with enlarged abdomen
from infancy, but hepatomegaly was first observed at
31=2 years. growth and weight were normal. history of
muscle abnormalities was negative. biochemical analysis revealed mildly elevated transaminases without
increase in levels of cholesterol, triglycerides,  xxxd3472xxx ,
lactate or creatine kinase. a liver biopsy was performed in a local hospital and suggested glycogen
storage disease, but a sample was not stored for
enzymatic examination. an intravenous glt showed
a postprandial increase in lactic acid while blood cell
enzymology revealed slight reduction in glycogen
phosphorylase a activity in leukocytes (table 1).
patient 7 is the first child of nonconsanguineous
polish parents. she presented at 2 years 3 months with
enlarged abdomen. physical examination revealed
hepatomegaly, without any muscle complaints. growth
and weight were normal. biochemical analysis
revealed significant elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides levels with only slight hypertransaminasaemia.
levels of  xxxd3472xxx , lactate and creatine kinase were
within reference ranges. an intravenous glt showed
postprandial lactic acidosis but blood cell enzymology
was normal (table 1). liver biopsy was performed,
revealing glycogen storage on histological staining and
quantitative analysis. enzymology from a liver sample
revealed reduced phosphorylase a activity (table 1).
patient 8 is the second child of unrelated austrian
parents. birth weight was 4150 g, length 50 cm at term.
she first presented at the age of 5 weeks with recurring

725

feeding difficulties and borderline blood glucose concentrations of 50–60 mg/dl. between the ages of 4 and
19 months she gained only 500 g of body weight. at
this age her weight was 2 kg below the 3rd centile and
her length 9.5 cm below. physical examination
revealed hepatomegaly and mild hypotonia. her bone
age was 9 months at 19 months chronological age.
biochemical analysis demonstrated normal to mildly
elevated transaminases and triglycerides. plasma concentrations of  xxxd3472xxx , lactate and creatine kinase
were within reference ranges. analysis did, however,
identify growth hormone deficiency and latent hypothyroidism that is being substituted with thyroxine.
liver and muscle biopsies were performed, revealing
glycogen storage in the liver but not in muscle.
enzymology from liver and muscle samples revealed
reduced phosphorylase a activity not apparent in the
blood cell analysis (table 1). at the age of 5 years, on
a hypercaloric diet via a percutaneous gastrostomy, she
is now thriving on the 25th centile for weight, but
growth remains substantially retarded (11.5 cm below
the 3rd centile). her intellectual and psychomotor
development is in the normal range.
results
enzymology results are shown in table 1. the results
of intravenous glt in patients 5, 6 and 7 showed that
glucose peaked at 5 min post infusion, returning to a
baseline of between 3.2 and 4.1 mmol/l at around
75 min. plasma lactate peaked at 2.7–4.4 mmol/l at
60 min post infusion and returned to a baseline of 1.1–
1.4 mmol/l after 2 h.
identification of mutations
patient 1 was initially diagnosed as having a deficiency
of phosphorylase kinase owing to the low ratio of
phosphorylase a to total phosphorylase activity
(table 1). analysis of the phka2, phkg2 and
phkb genes did not, however, identify a causative
mutation (data not shown). given the significant
similarity of symptoms between gsd type ix and
type vi, a diagnosis of glycogen phosphorylase deficiency was considered. analysis of  xxxg1909xxx  identified a
homozygous missense mutation c.2042a>c in exon 17
resulting in the substitution p.k681t (table 2). alignment of the amino acid sequence of liver glycogen

phosphorylase demonstrated that this residue is absolutely conserved in all cases (fig. 1).
two mutations of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene were identified in
patient 2. an inversion of six nucleotides and deletion
of four nucleotides [c.1964_1969inv6;c.1969+1_+
4delgtac] was characterized that removed the donor
splice site of intron 16. analysis of the surrounding
sequence using spliceview and nnsplice 0.9 programs identified the nearest available donor splice site
to be between positions c.1969+56_+57. use of this
splice site would lead to the substitution of glutamate
by glycine at position 655, a translational frameshift
and the introduction of a stop codon after a further
79 novel residues (p.e655gfsx81). the software predicted eight further cryptic donor splice sites the use of
which would lead to the introduction of between 104
and 954 nucleotides of intron 16 into the mature
mrna but result in an identical premature termination of translation, p.e655gfsx36. the second defect
identified in patient 2 was a missense mutation in exon
12, c.1471c>t leading to the amino acid substitution
p.r491c. the substituted residue is, again, within a

region of the protein conserved across isoforms and
species (fig. 1).
sequence analysis of dna samples from patients 3, 4,
5 and 6 demonstrated that each was compound heterozygous for novel missense mutations of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene
(table 2). alignment of the affected residues again
revealed complete conservation in all cases with the
exception of the glutamate at position 13 (fig. 1). the
amino-terminal region of glycogen phosphorylase,
which includes the glutamate residue at position 13, is
conserved in higher eukaryotes but is absent in the yeast
homologue and in e. coli maltodextrin phosphorylase.
patient 7 was shown to be compound heterozygous
for a novel missense mutation, c.2017g>a, p.e673k,
in exon 17 and a c.1195c>t transition within exon 10
that resulted in the introduction of a termination
codon at position 399 (table 2). once again the
 xxxd2431xxx  residue at position 673 was completely
conserved across species (fig. 1).
analysis of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene in genomic dna
samples from patient 8 identified a single heterozygous
missense mutation (table 2). the c.1900g>c trans-

version, which results in a p.d634h substitution, was
also observed in patient 6. no further sequence variations were identified other than those previously
identified as polymorphisms.

identification of polymorphisms
sequence analysis of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene in the eight
patients agreed with the coding sequence corrections
identified by burwinkel and colleagues (burwinkel
et al 1998). only one of the four exonic polymorphisms
they reported was identified in our patients, c.1020c/t
p.d340d. however, other nucleotides, both exonic
and intronic, were identified as polymorphic in these
patients (table 3). all are listed in the ncbi small
nucleotide polymorphism database, dbsnp (build 124)
except for c.2544+78g/a within the 3¶ untranslated
region, observed only in patient 2. where frequency
data were not available in dbsnp (for c.1828j2a/dela,
c.2178j27dupt/-, c.2544+11t/delt), both alleles were
observed in both patients and in normal individuals.
the effect of the c.1828j2a/dela polymorphism on
the intron 15 acceptor site was assessed in silico using
the spliceview and nnsplice 0.9 programs. analysis of the two alleles using spliceview revealed only a
minor difference in the score assigned to the two forms
of the polymorphism. the c.1828j2a allele scored 86,
while the c.1828j2dela allele scored 85. analysis
using nnsplice 0.9 revealed a greater difference in
the degree of match to a consensus splice site, with
scores of 0.91 for the c.1828j2a allele and 0.66 for the
c.1828j2dela allele.

discussion
we have identified 11 novel mutations of the  xxxg1909xxx 
gene in eight patients with gsd type vi (table 2).
nine of these result in the substitution of residues of
liver glycogen phosphorylase. we also describe the
first nonsense mutation, p.r399x, and the first small

table 3 polymorphisms
identified in the  xxxg1909xxx  gene
(nm_002863.3)

deletion [c.1964_1969inv6;c.1969+1_+4delgtac],
which in this case is coupled to a small inversion.
the inversion/deletion identified in patient 2
(table 2) leads to the destruction of the donor splice
site of intron 16. it was not possible to obtain a sample
of mrna from this patient, so we could not assess the
effect of the mutation on transcript splicing. we
therefore performed in silico analysis using splice site
prediction software to identify possible cryptic splice
sites within exon 16 or intron 16. nine possible sites
were identified. all would result in premature termination of translation and removal of a large part of the
carboxy-terminal domain of the protein, containing the
catalytic site. of the three other splice site mutations
identified in  xxxg1909xxx  only one, c.1768+1g>a in intron
14, results in the disruption of the reading frame and
the introduction of a premature stop codon (burwinkel
et al 1998; chang et al 1998). stable, aberrantly spliced
mrna products were observed, indicating the absence of nonsense-mediated mrna decay (chang and
kan 1979). the mutation identified in patient 2, as
with the nonsense mutation, r399x, in patient 7, is
therefore likely to affect protein rather than transcript
stability, leading to rapid degradation or, if a stable
protein is produced, to have a severe effect on its
function.
we identified nine novel missense mutations that
result in amino acid substitutions (table 2). eight of
these are highly conserved in isoforms of glycogen
phosphorylases from yeast to humans and in e. coli
maltodextrin phosphorylase (fig. 1). the exception,
gln13, substituted by proline in patient 7, is two
residues from ser15, which is phosphorylated by
the  xxxg218xxx  of phosphorylase kinase to convert
the inactive b form of glycogen phosphorylase into the
active a form. residues 1–20, forming the aminoterminal tail, show conservation throughout the glycogen phosphorylase isoforms of the higher eukaryotes
but are absent in yeast phosphorylase and in e. coli
maltodextrin phosphorylase. maltodextrin phosphorylase is not regulated by phosphorylation, while yeast glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by phosphorylation

within a nonhomologous amino terminal extension
(buchbinder et al 2001). recognition of glycogen
phosphorylase by phosphorylase kinase occurs primarily,
but not entirely, through specific contacts of the gamma
subunit with the amino-terminal tail (andreeva et al
2002; xu and carlson 1999). the glutamine residue at
position 13 contributes to these contacts by forming
specific hydrogen bonds with residues within the catalytic groove of the  xxxg218xxx . substitution by
proline, as in patient 6, is likely to have a profound
effect on the formation of these bonds and the flexibility
of the amino-terminal tail while it rotates to form an
alpha helix and binds to the dimer following phosphorylation of ser15 (lowe et al 1997).
three of the amino acid substitutions identified in
the patients (p.e673k in patient 7, p.s675l in patients 3
and 4 and p.s675t in patient 5) affect residues that are
involved in interactions with glucose 1-phosphate
(fig. 2a) (hudson et al 1993). schinzel and palm
(1990) highlighted the importance of the glutamate
residue at position 673 in stabilizing the transitionstate intermediate during phosphorylysis and promoting

the active dianion form of the catalytic cofactor plp.
hydrogen bonds formed by both this residue and the
serine residue at 675 with glucose 1-phosphate are likely
to have a significant role in positioning the substrate
(fig. 2a). the substitution of these residues would
therefore be predicted to have a significant effect on
the activity of the enzyme (martin et al 1990). in a
similar way the arginine residue at position 491,
substituted by cysteine in patient 2, lies in close proximity to plp, forming hydrogen bond interactions with
adjacent residues and a water molecule (fig. 2b). its
substitution could be predicted to disrupt the hydrogen
bond network in this region and the binding or
orientation of the plp molecule. an identical change
has also recently been identified in the gene encoding
the muscle isoform,  xxxg1910xxx , in a patient with mcardle
disease (bruno et al 2006).
the valine residue at position 456, while not
predicted to interact directly with glucose 1-phosphate,
does occupy a position that forms part of the activesite pocket (fig. 2a). substitution by the much bulkier
methionine residue would be predicted to impede

entry or positioning of the substrate into the pocket.
the valine residue is on the internal end of b-strand 17
that forms part of the main b-sheet within the
activation domain of the enzyme monomer. two of
the three residues affected by previously reported
missense mutations in  xxxg1909xxx  (p.n339s and p.n377k)
occupy similar positions on adjacent strands of the bsheet (burwinkel et al 1998). the edge of this b-sheet
may have an important role in the structural integrity
of the enzyme, or its interaction with glycogen, and its
disruption appears to be a significant mechanism in
glycogen phosphorylase deficiency (geremia et al
2002).
plp is bound to glycogen phosphorylase via a schiff
base to the lysine residue at position 681. this amino
acid is substituted by threonine as a result of the
homozygous mutation identified in patient 1 (table 2)
(oikonomakos et al 1987). the complete removal of
the cofactor has been demonstrated to result in an
inactive enzyme (shaltiel et al 1969). the severe
phenotype of the patient would suggest that the
mutation does eliminate all glycogen phosphorylase
activity in the liver. the mutation did not, however,
result in a reduction of glycogen phosphorylase
activity in leukocytes from the patient (table 1).
instead, the ratio of phosphorylase a activity to total
phosphorylase activity suggested that this patient had a
defect in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase,
perhaps through a deficiency of phosphorylase kinase,
but none could be identified. this case indicates that in
some instances phosphorylase activity in leukocytes is
not an accurate reflection of activity in the liver and
may suggest that a different isoform, either brain or
muscle, predominates in the leukocytes of this patient.
it also suggests that gsd type vi may be underdiagnosed and should be considered in cases where there
is a low ratio of phosphorylase a to total phosphorylase
activity.
patients 5, 6 and 8 are either heterozygous or
compound heterozygous for mutations which resulted
in the substitution of the asparagine residue at position
632 or the  xxxd233xxx  at 634. they inhabit the distal
end of a-helix 19 on the exterior of the molecule in a
region without an ascribed function. substitution of
these residues may have an effect on the structure of
the molecule during folding. both residues form
hydrogen bonds with adjoining secondary structures:
the asparagine residue at 632 with a valine residue on
the adjacent b-strand, and asp634 with a lysine on ahelix 18 (fig. 2c and 2d). disruption of the distal end
of a-helix 19 may alternatively have an effect at the
proximal end of the helix. the tyrosine residue at
position 614 is involved in an interaction with phe286

j inherit metab dis (2007) 30:722–734

on the f280s loop_ or gate (residues 281–290) at the
entrance to the catalytic-site tunnel that prevents
access to the active site in the inactive form of the
enzyme (barford and johnson 1989). the gate undergoes major rearrangement during activation of glycogen
phosphorylase, allowing substrate into the active site
(rath et al 2000). by disturbing a-helix 19 these mutations may disrupt this process, inhibiting activation of
glycogen phosphorylase.
only a single heterozygous mutation was identified
in patient 8 (table 2). it is unlikely that deficiency
results from a dominant negative effect, as the
identical mutation was also observed in compound
heterozygous form in patient 6. instead, it is probable
that a second mutation is present in this patient that
could not have been identified by the analysis
performed. two possibilities are currently being investigated, either a large deletion covering part of the
 xxxg1909xxx  gene or an intronic or promoter change, falling
outside the regions examined, that disrupts expression
of the gene.
this is the first report of mutations in the  xxxg1909xxx 
gene in patients who are of nonconsanguineous,
european descent (patients 2–8, table 2). the absence
of consanguinity is emphasized by the lack of homozygous mutations in these patients. it may also indicate
that the frequency of defects in the  xxxg1909xxx  gene has
been underestimated.
in four of the eight patients reported here there was
some degree of muscle and/or neuronal involvement in
the clinical symptoms experienced by the patients
(table 2). these included mild hypotonia, delayed
motor development and muscle weakness and cramps.
in patient 8 a muscle biopsy revealed a significant
reduction in the activity of activated glycogen phosphorylase. total glycogen phosphorylase activity was,
however, normal and there was no excess storage of
glycogen in the muscle, which was observed in the liver
biopsy. it is possible that the symptoms seen in these
patients result from the inability of the liver to control
plasma glucose levels. however, it is also feasible that
expression of the liver isoform of the enzyme is
essential in these tissues. the distribution of the
expression of the different isoforms of glycogen
phosphorylase in human tissues at various stages of
development has not been fully investigated.
from the data presented in table 2 it is possible to
make a generalized picture of the presentation of
patients with gsd type vi. patients present at around
the age 2–3 years with hepatomegaly, due to storage of
glycogen in the liver, and in some cases growth
retardation. in the majority of patients post-prandial
levels of lactate in plasma are increased (data obtained

in patients 5, 6 and 7 demonstrate that levels peak at
1 h following intravenous glucose infusion). hypoglycaemia is observed in a minority of cases but in these
cases it can be severe and lead to convulsions. the
activity of glycogen phosphorylase is generally within
normal ranges in leukocytes but significantly reduced
in liver biopsy.
with the routine introduction of genetic analysis of
the  xxxg1909xxx  gene it will be possible for patients to avoid
liver and muscle biopsy. both patients 1 and 2, despite
inconclusive results from the enzymology performed
on leukocyte samples, were diagnosed without resorting to liver biopsy. it is now feasible for this to be the
case for all patients with gsd type vi.
the mutations described here increase the number
of reported mutations in the  xxxg1909xxx  gene from 6 to 17
in a total of 11 patients (table 4) (burwinkel et al 1998;
chang et al 1998; tang et al 2003). this compares with
46 missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations of the
 xxxg1910xxx  gene, which encodes the muscle isoform of
glycogen phosphorylase, described in over 175 patients
with gsd type v or mcardle disease (http://www.
hgmd.cf.ac.uk/). comparison of the range of mutations
described in the  xxxg1909xxx  gene with the  xxxg1910xxx  gene
highlights some important differences. a single change,
the p.r50x mutation accounts for between 32% and
80% of affected  xxxg1910xxx  alleles (dependent on geographical location) (martı́n et al 2001). furthermore,
the two recent genotype–phenotype correlation studies
of spanish and italian mcardle patients demonstrated
that between 68% and 70% of affected alleles carried
nonsense, splicing or frameshift mutations leading to
premature termination of protein translation (bruno

et al 2006; martı́n et al 2001). this compares with no
single common change of the  xxxg1909xxx  gene observed in
patients with liver deficiency (only the p.d634h has
been observed in more then one unrelated patient)
and a substantially lower frequency, 7 of 23 (30%)
alleles, carry nonsense, splicing and frameshift mutations. this may be a result of the lower number of
gsd type vi patients that have been investigated.
alternatively, it is possible that it is necessary to have
complete, or near complete, deficiency of muscle
glycogen phosphorylase for a clinical phenotype to
develop. in liver, however, a partial reduction in the
available phosphorylase activity may be sufficient for
clinical symptoms to manifest. the range of mutations
present in gsd type vi also has an implication for
screening patients with gsd type vi. targeted
mutation detection in patients is not possible at
present; it is still necessary to use a whole-gene
approach.
acknowledgements this study was partly funded by a perfect project grant (eu qlg1-ct-202-90358). we would also
like to thank professor david rice and mr john berrisford for
their help in producing the structural representations of glycogen
phosphorylase.
