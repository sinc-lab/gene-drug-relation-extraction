aim: in the diabetic state, energy must be supplied mainly by amino acids and fat; therefore the
metabolic processes are very similar to those of animals fed a high-protein diet. vitamin b6dependent enzymes, which are highly involved in amino acid metabolism, are important in
diabetics. we investigated  xxxd3049xxx  content, and aspartate aminotransferase and glycogen
phosphorylase activities, in several tissues of  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic and control rats.
methods: the rats were fed a  xxxd3049xxx -free diet and administered an equivalent amount of
pyridoxine based on body weight.
results:  xxxd3049xxx  content in all tisues examined, except for the liver, was lower in the diabetics
than in controls. aspartate aminotransferase activity was higher in the liver of diabetics than in the
controls, but not in the other tissues. glycogen phosphorylase activity in the gastrocnemius
muscle of diabetics decreased to two-thirds of the control level.
conclusions: these data might indicate that diabetic animals should have a higher intake of
 xxxd3049xxx  because a diabetic state can lead to a  xxxd3049xxx -de®ciency.

introduction
there are contradictory reports regarding  xxxd3049xxx 
metabolism in diabetes. one report stated that hyperglycaemia induces  xxxd3049xxx  de®ciency [1] and others
reported that  xxxd3049xxx  de®ciency induces a decrease in
circulating insulin levels which results in diabetes [2,3]. in
previous studies, the glucose content in the plasma of
 xxxd3049xxx -depleted rats never exceeded that of the
controls, but rather tended to decrease in the vitamin b6de®cient rat [4±6].  xxxd3049xxx , as the active coenzyme
 xxxd3047xxx  (plp), has an important role in
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. cytosolic aspartate
aminotransferase (cast) [e.c.2.6.111], which functions
in gluconeogenesis, increases in the liver of diabetic rats
[6,7 8,9,10]. in the diabetic state, energy must be supplied
by amino acids and fats; therefore, the metabolic processes

are very similar to those of animals fed a high protein diet.
intake of a high protein diet requires a higher level of
 xxxd3049xxx  than does a low protein diet [11±15]. these
considerations led usto investigate theeffect ofdiabetes on
 xxxd3049xxx  requirement. in the present study, the
distribution of  xxxd3049xxx  in several tissues of diabetic
and non-diabetic rats administered an equivalent amount
of pyridoxine based on body weight was investigated and
the activities of some plp-dependent enzymes were
determined in the same animals.

intraperitoneally with 14.5 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride
solution in saline/100 g body weight (b.w.) every day in
the morning. the rats were divided into two groups and
group 1 was injected with intraperitoneal  xxxd3249xxx  (80 mg/kg b.w.) in citrate buffer, ph 4.5, once in the
evening on the second day to induce a diabetic
condition. group 2 was administered vehicle and served
as the controls.

phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and the supernatant, centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 3 g for 20 min, was used to analyse ast
activity. another piece of each liver, kidney, and muscle
tissue was homogenized with 9 vol. of 1 n-hcio4 (v/g)
and the supernatant, centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 3 g for
10 min, was used to analyse  xxxd3049xxx  content. antirat cast antiserum was prepared in rabbits as described
previously [18].

chemicals

methods

all reagents used were of the highest grade available and
were purchased from wako pure chemicals co. (osaka,
japan), boehringer (mannheim, germany), sigma
chemicals co. (st louis, mo, usa), or oriental yeast
co. (osaka, japan). all dietary materials were purchased
from oriental yeast co.

b6 vitamers were determined using high performance
liquid chromotography according to the method
originally described by edwards et al. [19] and
described previously [16]. a shimazu rf-535 ¯uorescence monitor was used to detect the ¯uorescence of
 xxxd3049xxx  (ex. 325 nm, em. 420 nm). glycogen
phosphorylase activity was determined by analysing
inorganic phosphate levels during the formation of
glycogen in the presence of 1 mm amp [20]. ast
activity was determined in the presence or absence of
10±4 m plp by measuring the rate of nadh oxidation
in the presence of  xxxg1739xxx  as described
by karmen [21]. cast activity (muscle and kidney)
was determined by subtracting the mitochondrial ast
activity from the total ast activity, in which the
mitochondrial activity was obtained using anticast
antiserum. ast activity in the erythrocytes was
followed by preincubation with lactate dehydrogenase
to remove endogenous pyruvate prior to starting the

preparation
all preparation procedures were carried out at 4 °c
unless otherwise stated. rats were decapitated and
blood was collected into heparinized tubes. a portion
of the blood was used to analyse haemoglobin and the
remaining blood was centrifuged at 2000 r.p.m. for
l0 min. the resultant packed cells were washed twice
with an equal volume of saline, suspended in 2 vol. of
water, and homogenized with a polytron for 1 min at 15
000 r.p.m. the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx 
000 3 g for 20 min and the supernatant was used to
measure ast activity and haemoglobin. the plasma
fraction was used for the determination of b6 vitamers
as described previously [16]. brie¯y, plasma (0.5 ml)
was diluted to 1 ml with water, 27 ml of 9 n-hcio4 was
added, the sample was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 3 g for
5 min, and the resultant supernatant was used for
analysis of the  xxxd3049xxx  content. rat tissues were
immediately removed, divided into two or three pieces
depending on the analysis and, except for a piece of
liver tissue for the measurement of cast, all tissue
samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a
freezer until they were used. pieces of liver tissue (not
frozen) were homogenized with 9 vol. of 0.25 m sucrose5 mm phosphate (ph 7.4) (v/g) buffer using a te¯on
homogenizer for 30 s at 1000 r.p.m., centrifuged at 40
000 r.p.m. for 60 min, and the supernatant was used to
analyse cast activity [17]. a piece of gastrocnemius
muscle was homogenized with 9 vol. of 0.1 m pipes
buffer (ph 6.0) (v/g) [15] and the supernatant, centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 3 g for 20 min, was used to analyse
phosphorylase [ xxxg909xxx   xxxg2386xxx .1] and ast activities. a piece
of kidney tissue was homogenized with 4 vol. of 0.1 m

results

statistical analysis

as shown in table 1, the growth of diabetic rats was
impaired and at the end of the experimental period the
body weight of the diabetics was almost half that of the
controls. blood glucose level was elevated by  xxxd3249xxx  injection. liver and kidney weights were higher
in the diabetics than in controls, whereas muscle weight
was lower when these tissue weights were based on b.w.

data were analysed using either students t-test or
scheffe's multiple test to determine which means were
signi®cantly different from each other.

effect of diabetes on growth of animals, tissue
weight, and plasma glucose

effect of diabetes on  xxxd3049xxx  content in several
tissues of rat
as shown in table 2,  xxxd3049xxx  content in the liver of
diabetic rats was higher than in controls and in the other
tissues, including kidney, muscle, and plasma, its
content was lower in diabetic rats than in controls.
 xxxd3049xxx  in the plasma of diabetics was only 14% of
the controls. the types of vitamers in the plasma varied
between groups; plasma in the control rats contained
plp and pyridoxal (pl), whereas pl was the only form
in the diabetics. in the liver of control rats, the pmp: plp
ratio was 2 : 1 and the content of  xxxd3048xxx  (pmp) tended to increase in the diabetics and this
increased pmp content may be re¯ected to an increase
in ast activity in the liver of diabetics. the kidney in
both diabetics and controls contained approximately
90% pmp and 10% plp. on the other hand, in the
muscle the ratio of plp to pmp was approximately 3 : 1
and these levels were very similar in the two groups.

diabetes and b6 requirement

effect of diabetes on the activities of plpdependent enzymes
table 3 shows the cast activity in the tissues of
diabetic and control rats. the enzyme activity in the
liver of diabetic rats was more than four times higher
than that in controls. in contrast, ast activity in the
erythrocytes of diabetics decreased by 45% of the
controls for the holo-activities and 32% of the controls
for the apo-activities. there was little change in ast
activity between diabetics and controls in the kidney
and muscle. the addition of plp on ast activity was
more effective in the diabetic rats, except for in the liver,
suggesting that diabetic rats tended towards a vitamin
b6 de®ciency under the experimental conditions. this
was most remarkable in the erythrocytes. muscle
phosphorylase activity was signi®cantly decreased in
the diabetic rats, again con®rming a tendency for
 xxxd3049xxx -de®ciency in the diabetics.

discussion
in our previous study, when rats were fed ad libitum on a
diet containing pyridoxine, diabetic rats ate almost oneand-a-half times more than did the controls and as the
result of such an excess intake of food, the plasma of
diabetic rats contained more  xxxd3049xxx  than that of the
controls [6]. in this study rats were given equivalent
amounts of pyridoxine based on the body weight (14.5 mg/
100 g b.w.) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to avoid such
an excess  xxxd3049xxx  infusion due to the increase of food
intake inthe diabetic group. the amount of pyridoxine was
just enough to maintain the normal physiologic conditions
with a 20% casein diet [15].
the gastrocnemius muscular weight of the diabetic
rats, based on b.w., was signi®cantly lower than that of
the controls (table 1), possibly re¯ecting an increase in
protein degradation to obtain amino acids as an energy
source in the diabetic condition. rodriguez et al. [23]
reported a 30% decrease of gastrocnemius muscle mass
in diabetics and they also reported that the muscle waste
associated with the diabetic state was a consequence of
changes in muscle protein turnover. conversion of
amino acids to an energy source is carried out by either
transaminase or a deamination reaction, both of which
are mainly catalysed by pyridoxal-dependent enzymes.
 xxxd3049xxx  levels in the plasma and aspartate or alanine
aminotransferase activity in the erythrocytes are commonly used for nutritional assessment of  xxxd3049xxx . in the
plasma of controls,  xxxd3049xxx  occurred mainly in the
forms of plp and pl, whereas only pl was present in the
plasma of the diabetic rats because of an increase in

alkaline phosphatase [6].  xxxd3049xxx  levels in the plasma
of diabetic rats were much lower than in the controls,
suggesting that more  xxxd3049xxx  was incorporated into the
liver in diabetic rats (table 2). an increased  xxxd3049xxx 
level in the liver of diabetic rats would result from the
induction of transaminases, including ast. indeed, as
shown in table 3, ast in the diabetic rat liver was more
than four times higher than in the controls and the ast
molecules were present mostly in the holo-form in both
groups. more ast molecules than observed in the present
study should be found in the liver of diabetic rats, because
there are also some ast molecules that have been
inactivated by a glycation reaction [10,24]. in contrast,
 xxxd3049xxx  levels were lower in thekidneys of the diabetics
than in the kidneys of the controls. furthermore, the plp
effect on ast activity was higher in the diabetics,
re¯ecting a tendency towards a  xxxd3049xxx  de®ciency in
the diabetic state. the forms of  xxxd3049xxx  in the tissues
examined, except for plasma, were pmp and plp, and the
ratios of pmp/plp were different between tissues. these
differences seemed to correlate to the type of vitamin b6dependent enzyme involved in each tissue; i.e. pmp and
plp are active on ast, whereas plp is only active form on
glycogen phosphorylase.
these data on  xxxd3049xxx  levels and vitamin b6dependent enzyme activities obtained in several tissues
indicate that the diabetic group had a weak vitamin b6de®ciency under the conditions employed in this study.
thus, we might emphasise the importance of supplementary  xxxd3049xxx  for diabetics.
