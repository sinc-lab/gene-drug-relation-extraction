abstract. amyloid imaging is limited by an inconsistent relationship between cerebral cortex amyloid- ␤ (a␤) plaques
and dementia. autopsy studies suggest that a␤ plaques first appear in the cerebral cortex while subcortical plaques are
present only later in the disease course. the presence of abundant plaques in both cortex and striatum is more strongly
correlated with the presence of dementia than cortical a␤ plaques alone. additionally, detection of striatal plaques may allow,
for the first time, pathology-based clinical staging of ad. striatal plaques are reportedly identifiable by amyloid imaging
but the accuracy and reliability of striatal amyloid imaging has never been tested against postmortem histopathology. to
determine this, we correlated the presence of histopathologically-demonstrated striatal a␤ deposits with a visually positive
panel consensus decision of a positive [18 f]flutemetamol striatal pet signal in 68 subjects that later came to autopsy. the
sensitivity of [18 f]flutemetamol pet striatal amyloid imaging, for several defined density levels of histological striatal a␤
deposits, ranged between 69% and 87% while the specificity ranged between 96% and 100%. sensitivity increased with
higher histological density thresholds while the reverse was found for specificity. in general, as compared with pet alone,
pet with ct had slightly higher sensitivities but slightly lower specificities. in conclusion, amyloid imaging of the striatum
with [18 f]flutemetamol pet has reasonable accuracy for the detection of histologically-demonstrated striatal a␤ plaques
when present at moderate or frequent densities. amyloid imaging of the cerebral cortex and striatum together may allow for
a more accurate clinicopathological diagnosis of ad and enable pathology-based clinical staging of ad.

relationship between cerebral cortex amyloid plaques
and dementia. recent amyloid imaging results
[1–8] have confirmed longstanding neuropathological reports [9–20] that many non-demented elderly
individuals have cortical amyloid plaques. additionally, amyloid imaging cannot provide a direct
estimate of the extent of neurofibrillary tangle (nft)
spread throughout the brain, and candidate nft or tau
imaging agents have not yet been validated against

autopsy findings. the neuropathological diagnosis
of ad, recently reformulated under the sponsorship of the national institute on aging and the
alzheimer’s association (nia-aa) requires the
presence of a minimal brain load of both plaques and
nfts [21, 22].
autopsy studies suggest that abundant striatal
amyloid plaques may be mainly restricted to subjects
in higher braak nft stages that are more likely to
meet clinicopathological diagnostic criteria for ad;
amyloid imaging of striatal plaques might therefore
be expected to offer greater diagnostic accuracy for
dementia due to ad than cortical amyloid imaging alone [23–27]. additionally, by analogy with
histopathological staging based on cerebral amyloid progression [24], striatal amyloid imaging could
allow the separation of subjects that have corticallyrestricted amyloid deposits from those with both
cortical and striatal amyloid deposition; this would
enable, for the first time, pathology-based clinical
staging of ad. a small number of reports indicate that striatal amyloid plaques may be identifiable
by amyloid imaging [28–33] but the accuracy and
reliability of striatal amyloid imaging has never
been tested against the gold standard of postmortem
histopathology. this study was designed as a preliminary test of the ability of striatal pet amyloid
imaging to detect histopathologically-demonstrated
striatal amyloid plaques.
the agent [18 f]flutemetamol [7, 34–36] has been
recently approved by the us fda and the eu ema
for the detection of brain amyloid (marketed as
vizamyltm by ge healthcare). as a continuation
of a phase iii clinical trial designed to test the concordance of antemortem [18 f]flutemetamol positron
emission tomography (pet) cortical amyloid imaging (by visual assessment) with postmortem histological amyloid presence [7], the [18 f]flutemetamol
pet striatal amyloid signal, together with histological amyloid-␤ (a␤) staining, was evaluated in 68
subjects who came to autopsy. the results were used
to obtain estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of
[18 f]flutemetamol pet striatal amyloid imaging for
the presence of histologically-verified striatal amyloid deposits.
material and methods
study design and participants
the initial study was a phase iii, multicenter pet study of  xxxd2144xxx  injection for

estimating cerebral cortex neuritic plaque density
[7]. local institutional review boards or ethics
committees approved the study protocol before initiation. all subjects or their caregivers/relatives gave
written informed consent before study procedures
were performed. the clinicaltrials.gov identifier is
nct01165554.
eligible subjects were ≥55 years of age, terminally ill with a life expectancy ≤1 year, with general
health adequate to undergo the study procedures.
pregnant/lactating women were excluded. subjects
were ineligible if they had known/suspected structural brain abnormalities, a contraindication for pet,
a known or suspected hypersensitivity/allergy to
flutemetamol 18 f injection (or any of its components), or had participated in any clinical study using
an investigational agent within 30 days of signing
consent.
a clinical diagnosis of ad, other dementing disorder, mild cognitive impairment, or no cognitive
impairment was determined by chart review. before
pet imaging, enrolled subjects underwent diagnostic head x-ray computed tomography (ct), unless
images of research quality, obtained within 12 months
of the screening visit, were available. the objective was to determine the sensitivity of blinded
visual interpretations of striatal [18 f]flutemetamol
pet images for estimating amyloid plaque densities
in the same regions.
pet imaging
injection of flutemetamol 18 f injection was
administered intravenously within 40 seconds; the
dose was 185–370 mbq at the physician’s discretion,
based on how long the patient could tolerate lying in
the scanner. pet image data were collected over 10
minutes, starting 90 minutes after injection.
all pet images were randomized and approximately 10% of the images were duplicated and
randomly combined with the other images to measure
intra-reader reproducibility.
reading methodology
reading of the images was conducted by five
readers, who underwent image-read methodology
training that has formed the basis of an interactive
electronic system which is now available online. the
training instructed readers on recognizing anatomy
in  xxxd2144xxx  pet images and specified image orientation and intensity adjustments. following this,

fig. 1. morphological approach to reading cortical and striatal [18 f]flutemetamol pet signals. for cortical assessment (a–d; f–i), a negative
or normal appearance (top row of images, a–d) for regions is characterized by a white matter pattern with the sulcal-gyral contour apparent
and with intensities tapered in the white to grey matter direction; a positive or abnormal appearance (bottom row, f–i) is characterized by the
absence of a sulcal-gyral contour, due to the merging of the white non amyloid-specific tracer uptake and the amyloid based elevated uptake
in the grey matter. for striatal assessment, a negative or normal appearance (top row, e) is characterized by a gap of low signal intensity that
separates the higher signal intensities of the frontal white matter anteriorly and the thalamus posteriorly; a positive or abnormal appearance
(bottom row, j) is characterized by the appearance of a “bridge” of high intensity signal that fills in the gap. images are in the axial plane
except for d and i, which are in the parasagittal plane. f, frontal gyri; lt, lateral temporal gyri; ins, insular gyri; pc, precuneus; s, striatum
(head of caudate nucleus and putamen).

readers were trained in techniques for reviewing the
frontal and temporal lobes as well as the posterior
cingulate/precuneus regions, insula and the striatum.
scrolling was emphasized and examples were presented and reviewed for trainee readers. images were
reviewed in the axial plane, except for the posterior
cingulate gyrus and precuneus, where the parasagittal
plane was used. for cortical assessment, a negative
or normal appearance for cortical regions was characterized by a white matter pattern with the sulcal-gyral
outtime apparent and with intensities tapered in the
white to gray matter direction. a positive or abnormal appearance was characterized by the absence of a
sulcal-gyral pattern, due to the merging of the white
non amyloid-specific matter, tracer uptake and the
amyloid based elevated uptake in the gray matter. the
assessment of the striatum was performed by looking for a bridge in intensity between the thalamus
and frontal white matter (positive) or by a clearly
reduced region of intensity between the two structures (negative). this assessment was performed in
an axial plane in slices adjacent to and co-planar with
that defined by the anterior-posterior commissures.
examples of normal and elevated intensity are shown
for the five reviewed regions in fig. 1.
after suitable training in [18 f]flutemetamol image
assessments, five independent qualified readers blind
to subjects’ clinical and postmortem status independently interpreted scans at a central image review
center. images of four cortical regions and of the
striatum (fig. 1) were each assessed as positive
or negative: the cortical regions included standard
levels of 1) frontal/anterior cingulate, 2) posterior cingulate/precuneus, 3) insula, and 4) lateral temporal
lobe, while 5) the striatum was assessed at the level

of the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen. the
cerebral cortex and striatum regions were each classified as positive or negative based on the majority
decision of the five readers. the case was considered
positive if any region was positive.
after readers interpreted the pet images and
locked their decisions, the images were randomized
again and were re-read with ct images for anatomic
guidance. inter-reader agreement and intra-reader
reproducibility were determined for the visual pet
interpretations without and with ct images.
postmortem histological procedures
postmortem procedures were performed on 68
subjects who died during the study period and
had postmortem brain examination. immunohistochemical staining for a␤ was performed on brain
tissue from subjects who died during the study and
underwent brain autopsy. postmortem histopathology
analysis was performed at a central pathology laboratory. tissue blocks were chosen to closely match
the regions evaluated with [18 f]flutemetamol pet.
therefore, the striatum was assessed at the level
of the head of the caudate and putamen. the a␤
staining procedure utilized  xxxd2154xxx  pretreatment
and the monoclonal antibody 4g8 at 1:100 dilution
(covance, usa). signal development employed a
biotinylated secondary antibody (dakocytomation
e0354, uk) and visualization with the dabmap
kit (ventana, usa). striatal amyloid plaques (all
plaque types, e.g., diffuse, cored, neuritic, etc., were
considered together) were graded blind to clinical
or neuropathological status by two neuropathologists (tgb and dt). plaque density scores were

obtained by assigning values of none, sparse, moderate and frequent, analogously to the published
consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer’s
disease (cerad) guidelines [37]. disagreements
between the two pathology-readers were resolved by
alternating the decision between readers.
brains were classified according to the level of
national institute on aging – alzheimer’s association (nia-aa) ad neuropathological change (not,
low, intermediate or high) [21, 22], by the amyloid
phase [24] and the braak neurofibrillary degeneration
stage [38].
statistical analysis
the blinded visual interpretations of pet images,
with or without concurrent reference to ct images
for anatomical clarification, were used to calculate
the sensitivity and specificity of positive imaging
decisions for varying levels of a␤ plaque density.
sensitivity and specificity were determined as point
estimates with exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals (cis). inter-reader agreement and intra-reader
reproducibility in the blinded visual image assessments were determined as percentage agreement and
kappa coefficient. differences between group means
were tested with unpaired, two-tailed t-tests or mannwhitney u-tests as appropriate.
results
characteristics of study subjects
the clinical and neuropathological characteristics
of the 68 autopsied subjects are shown in table 1.
subjects died at a median age of 82. imaging with
[18 f]flutemetamol pet was performed a mean of
3.5 months (range, 0 to 13 months) before death.
fifty-eight subjects were demented while 10 were
non-demented. of those with dementia, 30 had been
clinically diagnosed with ad dementia (3 of these
also had parkinson’s disease), 19 were classified as
dementia, not otherwise specified, 3 were parkinson’s
disease with dementia, 1 was corticobasal degeneration, 1 was dementia with lewy bodies or parkinson’s
disease, 2 were classified normal pressure hydrocephalus with dementia, 1 was pick’s disease, and 1
was vascular dementia. there were 10 non-demented
subjects; two of these had parkinson’s disease while
the other 8 had no other neurological diagnosis.
in terms of ad histopathology, subjects had appreciable amyloid plaque and nft burdens. for all

subjects considered together, the median amyloid
phase was 4, the median braak neurofibrillary degeneration stage was 4, the median cerad neuritic
plaque density was moderate and the median niaaa neuropathological change level was intermediate.
striatal [18 f]ﬂutemetamol pet readings
thirty-seven subjects were classified as positive
for striatal amyloid (figs. 1–3) on [18 f]flutemetamol
pet striatal majority reads while 40 were classified as striatal positive using [18 f]flutemetamol pet
with ct (table 2). the three additional positive
cases ascertained with pet/ct were confirmed as
positive with immunohistochemical a␤ staining on
postmortem sections of striatum, indicating that the
usage of ct may increase the sensitivity for striatal
amyloid detection by pet. subjects positive for striatal amyloid using [18 f]flutemetamol pet with ct
were significantly older (82.7 versus 78.1; p < 0.05)
and had significantly higher amyloid phase, braak
nft stage, cerad cortical neuritic plaque density,
and nia-aa ad neuropathological change level,
compared to subjects negative for striatal amyloid
(p < 0.0001).
there were only two cases in this group of subjects where cortex and striatum were not both positive
or both negative by majority assessment. these two
cases both had a positive cortical signal and a negative striatal signal. all cases with a positive striatal
signal also had a positive cortical signal.
pairwise between-reader agreement was ≥90%
with ct and ≥87% without ct, except for comparisons involving reader 3 (72%–84% without ct and
78%–82% with ct); kappa scores were also lower for
reader 3. kappa scores were higher with ct. withinreader reproducibility ranged from 83%–100% both
with and without ct images, and kappa ranges were
0.67–1.00.
antemortem-postmortem correlations for striatal
amyloid
the hypothesis was that a positive striatal amyloid
image assessment by the majority of trained readers
would predict, with high sensitivity and specificity,
the presence of histologically-demonstrated striatal
amyloid plaques at or above specified densities. in
the examination of this hypothesis, different levels of
histological striatal amyloid plaque densities (fig. 4)
were used as the “gold standard” or “standard of
truth” as it is assumed that striatal amyloid image

fig. 3. series of horizontal plane [18 f]flutemetamol pet images. these show the transition from negative to positive striatal signal in
five different subjects, as marked by the development and widening of a higher intensity signal “bridge” between the high intensity signal
normally present, in all subjects, in the thalamus posteriorly and the frontal lobe white matter anteriorly. arrows show the absence of a
bridge in a–c, with the beginnings of a bridge in d and a well-formed bridge in e. for the first three subjects (a–c), the striatum was
read as pet-negative, while for the two other subjects (d,e), the striatum was read as pet-positive (d,e). postmortem histology confirmed
the presence of amyloid phase 3 (a␤ deposition with spread from cortex to striatum but not to substantia nigra or cerebellum) in the two
subjects read as striatum pet-positive while the three subjects read as striatum pet negative had no striatal a␤ histopathology. amyloid
phase 3 is the first phase at which striatal a␤ deposition occurs, so the two subjects in d and e are the lowest amyloid phase that a positive
[18 f]flutemetamol pet signal might be observed, with some phase 3 subjects read as pet-negative and some as pet-positive.

reading will not be as sensitive to the presence of amyloid as the histological stains. as amyloid angiopathy
was only observed in 5 subjects and was present at
only sparse densities, the pet signal in the striatum
is assumed to be due entirely to plaques.
inter-reader agreement (tgb and drt) for the
histopathological grading of striatal amyloid plaque
density, as none, sparse, moderate or frequent, was
60/68 subjects (88.2%). for the 8 subjects for whom
there was a disagreement, the decision was made by
alternating between the two readers.
the sensitivity of [18 f]flutemetamol pet imaging for detecting varying densities of striatal amyloid

plaques ranged from 68.5 to 86.7% while the specificity ranged from 96 to 100% (table 3) depending
upon which histologic threshold was applied. using a
higher plaque density to define the true positive state
resulted in higher sensitivity but lower specificity.
imaging with ct to assist with anatomical localization gave slightly higher sensitivity but slightly lower
specificity.
discussion
amyloid imaging is an excellent diagnostic tool
for determining whether dementia is due to ad or

t.g. beach et al. / striatal plaques with [18 f]ﬂutemetamol pet

not [39]. however, due to the high prevalence of
amyloid plaques in non-demented elderly subjects,
amyloid imaging cannot, in the absence of clinical
information, distinguish between clinically relevant
and irrelevant cortical amyloid plaque loads. amyloid imaging does not indicate the extent of nft
spread throughout the brain and this also limits its
usefulness, as it is widely accepted that a minimal
brain load of both plaques and tangles is necessary
to cause dementia [21, 22]. autopsy studies, however, have suggested that the amount of striatal a␤
deposition might be a useful marker of the presence
of clinicopathological ad as abundant striatal plaque
densities occur only at later histopathological stages
of ad, and largely after dementia onset [23–27].
this is the first study to evaluate the accuracy of
striatal pet amyloid imaging for the detection of
striatal amyloid plaques. the results indicate that
[18 f]flutemetamol pet imaging of the striatum has
approximately 77 to 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of striatal a␤ plaques when
they are present at moderate or frequent densities.
sparse striatal plaque densities were not detected. the
ability of striatal [18 f]flutemetamol pet imaging to
provide a reasonably accurate prediction of the presence of striatal amyloid plaques allows, for the first
time, pathology-based clinical staging of ad, as subjects with a positive striatal amyloid signal will be at a
more advanced stage of ad than subjects with only a
positive cortical amyloid signal [24]. this may be of
considerable importance for the analysis of the effects
of experimental agents in clinical trials for ad, or for
ad prevention, as it is likely that therapeutic agents
would be more likely to be efficacious in subjects at
lower rather than higher histopathological stages of
ad.
in this study, there were only two subjects with
a positive cortical amyloid pet signal but a negative striatal signal. this scarcity may have been
due to an under-representation of non-demented subjects (10/68) and subjects with lower amyloid phases.
data from large autopsy studies with a greater representation of non-demented subjects indicate that
cortical amyloid is often present in the absence of
striatal amyloid, potentially allowing a practically
useful clinical separation of two pathological stages
of ad. large autopsy-based studies also indicate that
cortical amyloid imaging may have reasonably high
sensitivity, over 90%, but low specificity, between
50% and 70%, for distinguishing demented ad
subjects from non-demented subjects while striatal
amyloid imaging (based on histopathology) should

871

have similar sensitivity but much greater specificity,
about 85% [26].
in conclusion, amyloid imaging of the striatum has reasonable accuracy for the detection
of histologically-demonstrated striatal a␤ plaques
present at moderate or frequent densities. amyloid
imaging of the cerebral cortex and striatum together
may allow for a more accurate clinicopathological
diagnosis of ad and for pathology-based clinical
staging of ad but this will require further testing
in studies that evaluate both striatal and cortical amyloid in large numbers of non-demented and demented
subjects.
