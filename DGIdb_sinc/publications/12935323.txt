beneficial effects of fish liver preparations of sea bass (lates calcarifer) versus gemfibrozil in high fat diet-induced lipid-intolerant rats.  abnormal lipid metabolism is a main cause of dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and obesity and is even linked to diabetic-dyslipidemic complications. fifteen days of high-fat feeding in charles foster rats resulted in a significant increase in baseline serum lipid levels accompanied by pronounced dyslipidemia. treatment with fish liver preparations (flps) from sea bass and the standard drug gemfibrozil produced a lowering of serum lipids and glucose levels, along with a fall in very-low-density and low-density lipoprotein and an increase in high-density lipoprotein levels. simultaneously, reactivation of plasma postheparin lipolytic activity (phla) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase ( xxxg1305xxx ) activity was also observed. a positive correlation was observed between low-density lipoprotein activity and fecal bile acid excretion, which was enhanced on treatment with flps and gemfibrozil, indicating the catabolic process for normal lipids and cholesterol homeostasis. these data suggest that flps and gemfibrozil not only lower lipid intolerance but also reduce diabetic-dyslipidemic complications by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppar).
