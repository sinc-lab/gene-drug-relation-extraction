f161–f169, 2000.—the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter (tsc) is the major pathway for salt reabsorption
in the apical membrane of the mammalian distal convoluted
tubule. when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes, rat tsc
exhibits high affinity for both cotransported ions, with the
michaelis-menten constant (km) for na⫹ of 7.6 ⫾ 1.6 mm and
for cl⫺ of 6.3 ⫾ 1.1 mm, and hill coefficients for na⫹ and cl⫺
consistent with electroneutrality. the affinities of both na⫹
and cl⫺ were increased by increasing concentration of the
counterion. the ic50 values for thiazides were affected by
both extracellular na⫹ and cl⫺. the higher the na⫹ or cl⫺
concentration, the lower the inhibitory effect of thiazides.
finally, rtsc function is affected by extracellular osmolarity. we propose a transport model featuring a random order
of binding in which the binding of each ion facilitates the
binding of the counterion. both ion binding sites alter thiazide-mediated inhibition of transport, indicating that the
thiazide-binding site is either shared or modified by both na⫹
and cl⫺.

na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter is the major nacl transport pathway in the apical membrane of
the mammalian distal convoluted tubule (dct). the
presence of such a cotransporter was suggested by
kunau et al. (21), following the observation that chlorothiazide inhibited salt reabsorption in the distal portion of the nephron. later micropuncture studies (7, 9)
provided strong evidence supporting the existence of a
na⫹, cl⫺-coupled transport mechanism of salt reabsorption in the mammalian dct that was specifically
inhibited by thiazides. after these studies, beamount
et al. (2) observed that tracer [3h] xxxd2627xxx  was able
to bind with two different binding sites in plasma
membranes: one with high affinity [dissociation constant (kd) ⫽ 4.27 nm] and the other with low affinity

(kd ⫽ 289 nm). the high-affinity [3h] xxxd2627xxx  binding site was found to be present only in renal cortical
membrane preparations, and not in those from outer or
inner renal medulla or other organs; the binding was
selectively blocked by thiazides, with an affinity profile
that was similar to their potency as clinical diuretics.
these binding properties of the high-affinity site for
 xxxd2627xxx  were considered compatible with a putative thiazide receptor, that is, with the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter. [3h] xxxd2627xxx  binding to
renal cortical membranes was subsequently used to
study this receptor (3, 6, 30).
the primary structure of the thiazide-sensitive na⫹cl⫺ cotransporter [tsc or ncc] has been elucidated
from cloning of cdnas from the winter flounder urinary bladder (15) and from rat (rtsc) (14) and human
kidney (htsc) (29). tsc belongs to the superfamily of
electroneutral cation-coupled cl⫺ cotransporters from
which seven genes have been identified: one encodes
for the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter (14,
15), two genes encode the bumetanide-sensitive na⫹k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter (14, 32) and four genes encode
the k⫹-cl⫺ cotransporters (16, 23, 25). rtsc mrna is
expressed in renal cortex and rtsc protein is expressed at the apical membrane of dct cells of rat and
human kidney (24, 26). in humans, the tsc gene is
localized on chromosome 16 and mutations of this gene
have been linked to gitelman’s syndrome (29), an autosomal recessive disease featuring chronic arterial
hypotension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. targeted disruption of
the tsc gene in mice resulted in a partial gitelman’slike syndrome (27).
the functional characteristics of tsc from the winter flounder urinary bladder have been studied in some
detail (15), revealing that teleost tsc exhibits km
values for na⫹ and cl⫺ of 25.0 ⫾ 0.4 and 13.5 ⫾ 0.2
mm, respectively. hill coefficients for both ions were
close to unity, consistent with electroneutral cotransport. in addition, thiazide inhibition of flounder tsc
function revealed a potency profile that was similar to

functional characterization of rtsc

that previously shown for inhibition of cl⫺-dependent
na⫹ absorption in the flounder urinary bladder [assessed as the short-circuit current (22)] and for thiazide competition for the high-affinity [3h] xxxd2627xxx 
binding site on rat kidney cortical membranes (2). in
this study we present a functional characterization of
the mammalian na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter, rtsc, as expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes.
methods

x. laevis oocytes preparation. adult female x. laevis frogs
were purchased from two different vendors: nasco (fort
atkinson, mi) and carolina biological supply (burlington,
nc). oocytes were surgically harvested from anesthetized
frogs under 0.17% tricaine and incubated during 1 h under
vigorous shaking in nd-96 [(in mm) 96 nacl, 2 kcl, 1.8
cacl2, 1 mgcl, and 5 hepes/tris, ph 7.4] in the presence of
2 mg/ml of collagenase b after which oocytes were washed
four times in nd-96 and manually defolliculated. oocytes
were incubated overnight in nd-96 at 18°c supplemented
with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 mg/100 ml of gentamicin. stage v-vi oocytes (8) were then injected with 50 nl of
water or rtsc crna at a concentration of 0.5 ␮g/␮l or 25 ng
crna per oocyte. after injection, oocytes were incubated 3–4
days in nd-96 with sodium pyruvate and gentamicin. the
incubation medium was changed every 24 h. the day before
the uptake experiments were performed, oocytes were
switched to a cl⫺-free nd-96 [(in mm) 96 na⫹-isethionate, 2
k⫹-gluconate, 1.8 ca2⫹-gluconate, 1.0 mg2⫹-gluconate, 5
hepes, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 5 mg% gentamicin, ph 7.4] for
at least 12 h (15).
in vitro rtsc crna translation. to prepare the rtsc
crna, rtsc cdna in psport1 (14) was linearized at the 3⬘
end by using not i from boehringer (mannheim, germany)
and crna was transcribed in vitro, by using the t7 rna
polymerase mmessage kit (ambion). transcription product integrity was confirmed on agarose gels, and concentra-

cl⫺ (control), in absence of extracellular cl⫺ or in presence of 10⫺4

assessment of the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter function. functional analysis of the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter was assessed by
measuring tracer 22na⫹ uptake (new england nuclear) in
groups of at least 15 oocytes. 22na⫹ uptake was measured by
using the following protocol: a 30-min incubation period in an
isotonic k⫹- and cl⫺-free medium [(in mm) 96 na⫹-gluconate, 6.0 ca2⫹-gluconate, 1.0 mg2⫹-gluconate, 5 hepes/
tris, ph 7.4] with 1 mm ouabain, 100 ␮m bumetanide, and
100 ␮m amiloride, followed by 60-min uptake period in a
k⫹-free isotonic medium. for most experiments the isotonic
medium contained (mm) 40 nacl, 56 n-methyl-d-glucamine
(nmdg)-cl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 5 hepes, ph7.4, supplemented with 1 mm ouabain, 100 ␮m bumetanide, 100 ␮m
amiloride, and 2.5 ␮ci of 22na⫹. ouabain was added to
prevent sodium exit via the na⫹-k⫹-atpase, bumetanide to
inhibit the oocyte na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter, and amiloride
to block other na⫹ pathways in the oocytes, such as the
na⫹-h⫹ antiporter and na⫹ channels.
to determine the ion transport kinetics and the order of
ion binding to the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter, we performed
experiments using varying concentrations of na⫹ and cl⫺.
to maintain osmolality and ionic strength, gluconate was
used as a cl⫺ substitute and nmdg as a na⫹ substitute. the
sensitivity and kinetics for thiazide-type diuretics were assessed by exposing groups of rtsc crna-injected oocytes to
each diuretic at concentrations varying from 10⫺9 to 10⫺4 m.
for these experiments, the desired concentration of the diuretic was present in both the incubation and uptake periods.
in addition, concentration-dependent effect of thiazides on
rtsc function was assessed by using uptake solutions containing different concentrations of extracellular na⫹ or cl⫺.
finally, uptake experiments were also performed by using
three different osmolarity conditions for the oocytes: hypotonicity (110 mosmol/kgh2o), isotonicity (210 mosmol/kgh2o),
and hypertonicity (305 mosmol/kgh2o). all solutions for
these experiments contained 40 mm nacl, which resulted in
an osmolarity of ⬃110. for the isotonic and hypertonic solutions, osmolarity was adjusted by adding 90 mm or 190 mm
sucrose, respectively.
all uptakes were performed at 30°c. at the end of the
uptake period, oocytes were washed 5 times in ice-cold up-

groups was tested by one-way anova with multiple com-

expression of rtsc in x. laevis oocytes. we have
previously shown that x. laevis oocytes do not exhibit
endogenous expression of the thiazide-sensitive na⫹cl⫺ cotransporter (14, 15). figure 1 shows a summary
from six experiments of rtsc expression in oocytes.
na⫹ uptake increased from a level of 157 ⫾ 10 pmol 䡠
oocyte⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 in water-injected oocytes to a value of
7,555 ⫾ 228 pmol 䡠 oocyte⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 in rtsc crnainjected oocytes. thus injection of x. laevis oocytes
with rtsc crna resulted in an average 48-fold increase in na⫹ uptake (range 40 to 150-fold in different
experiments). the increased na⫹ uptake was chloride
dependent and thiazide sensitive, with uptake in the
absence of extracellular cl⫺ being 709 ⫾ 114 pmol 䡠

figure 2 shows that na⫹ uptake in water-injected
oocytes was small and linear during 30 min of uptake.
in rtsc crna-injected oocytes, the uptake increased
rapidly and was also linear during the first 30 min.
thus we used a 60-min uptake period for all experiments, except when evaluating ion kinetic analyses
where 15-min uptakes were performed.

to unity: 1.04 ⫾ 0.17 and 1.07 ⫾ 0.14 for na⫹ and cl⫺,
respectively.
to test whether extracellular na⫹ and cl⫺ concentrations influence the binding of the counterion, we
examined the counterion concentration dependency of
na⫹ uptakes at varying fixed concentrations of extracellular na⫹ or cl⫺. tables 1 and 2 show the results of
these experiments as the kinetic parameters (km and
vmax) for cl⫺ or na⫹, respectively. table 1 shows that
the apparent km for cl⫺ was significantly affected by
extracellular na⫹ concentration. the apparent km for
cl⫺ increased from 6.46 ⫾ 1.7 to 21.2 ⫾ 0.4 mm (p ⬍
0.01) when extracellular na⫹ decreased from 40 to 2
mm. thus the higher the sodium concentration, the
higher the affinity of rtsc for extracellular cl⫺. similarly, the km for na⫹ also was affected by extracellular
cl⫺. as table 2 shows, km for extracellular na⫹ varied
from 7.26 ⫾ 2.4 to 41.9 ⫾ 6.9 mm (p ⬍ 0.01), when
extracellular cl⫺ concentration varied from 40 to 2
mm. thus the higher the chloride concentration, the
higher the affinity of rtsc for na⫹.
kinetics of thiazide inhibition of rtsc. thiazideinduced inhibition of rtsc has been considered for
years as the hallmark of the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter
that is expressed in the apical membrane of the mam-

malian dct and the teleost urinary bladder. thus we
analyzed the inhibitory kinetics of several thiazidetype diuretics on rtsc crna injected-oocytes. the
results of this series of experiments are shown in fig.
4. the rank of order for rtsc inhibition was  xxxd2983xxx  ⬎  xxxd2627xxx  ⫽  xxxd299xxx  ⬎  xxxd3425xxx  ⬎ hydrochlorothiazide ⬎  xxxd1680xxx 
( xxxd1680xxx  not shown). rtsc function was not
affected by the addition of a nondiuretic thiazide derivative such as  xxxd1868xxx , tested in concentrations
from 10⫺14 to 10⫺4 m in the uptake medium (data not
shown). in addition, rtsc function was not inhibited
by furosemide or acetazolamide (data not shown).
effect of ph on rtsc function and thiazide inhibition. table 3 shows that there is no effect of extracellular ph in the range of 6.0 to 8.0 on both rtsc
function and thiazide sensitivity. uptakes were performed in solutions containing 40 mm nacl, with ph of
6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. as table 3 shows, all groups
exhibited similar uptakes. in addition, we tested two
different thiazides:  xxxd2627xxx  at a concentration of
5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m that is just above ic50 and  xxxd299xxx  at 5 ⫻ 10⫺7 m that is just below ic50. in these
experiments, ph had no effect on  xxxd2627xxx  or  xxxd299xxx  rtsc inhibition of na⫹ uptake (not
significant by using one-way anova).
effects of extracellular ions on thiazide inhibition of
rtsc. tran et al. (30) observed that binding of tracer
[3h] xxxd2627xxx  to its putative receptor was inhibited
by increased cl⫺ and stimulated by increased na⫹
concentrations. they proposed that thiazides and cl⫺
competed for the same site or at least for part of the
same binding site on the protein. to examine this issue
at a functional level, we evaluated the effect of extracellular cl⫺ on the kinetics of inhibition of several
thiazides. to this end, we assessed kinetics of rtsc
inhibition of five different thiazide-type diuretics, in
the presence of 2 or 100 mm extracellular cl⫺. we used
2 mm cl⫺ because this concentration is clearly below

the apparent km for cl⫺ (figs. 3 and 4). the results of
these series of experiments are shown in fig. 5 and
table 4. it is clear that the affinity of rtsc for each
thiazide is shifted to the left in the presence of a lower
extracellular cl⫺ concentration, indicating that cl⫺
affects the binding of thiazide diuretics to rtsc. we
also assessed the effect of extracellular na⫹ on inhibition of rtsc by  xxxd2627xxx . as illustrated in fig. 6, the
ic50 was shifted to the left as na⫹ concentration decreased in the uptake medium. when na⫹ concentration was 2 mm, the ic50 was 3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m, whereas in
the presence of 100 mm na⫹, the ic50 was 2 ⫻ 10⫺6 m.
thus the concentration of na⫹ in extracellular fluid
also influences the inhibition of rtsc function by  xxxd2627xxx .
to further examine the effect of ions on thiazide
inhibition of rtsc function, we assessed the effect of
increased concentrations of extracellular na⫹ or cl⫺ on
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2627xxx  at a concentration of
5 ⫻ 10⫺7 m, the ic50 of this diuretic. for these exper-

regulation of rtsc by osmolarity. the  xxxg2080xxx , rtsc, is highly expressed in the apical
membranes of the dct (24, 26). in this nephron segment, the tubular fluid arriving from the medullary
thick ascending limb can vary in osmolarity from hypotonic to isotonic. accordingly, we studied the effect of

cl⫺-dependent fraction and the thiazide-sensitive fraction of na⫹ uptake was assessed in rtsc-injected oocytes that were exposed to an uptake medium containing 40 mm nacl at three different osmolarities:
hypotonic (⬃110 mosmol/kgh2o), the osmolarity obtained by the 40 mm nacl concentration in the uptake
medium; and isotonic (⬃205 mosmol/kgh2o) or hypertonic (⬃310 mosmol/kgh2o) by adding sucrose to the
40 mm nacl uptake medium. thus uptakes were performed in different osmolar conditions, without chang-

in the present study we have functionally characterized the rat thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter,
rtsc. as shown previously (14), rtsc gives rise to
thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransport when expressed in x. laevis oocytes. the kinetic analyses for
both ions reveal that rtsc exhibits very high affinities
for na⫹ and cl⫺. hill coefficients for each ion were
unity, consistent with a stoichiometry of 1na:1cl and
the electroneutral nature of the cotransport process.
the km values for both ions were ⬍ 8 mm. these ion
affinities are somewhat higher than those obtained for
the  xxxg2080xxx  from winter flounder urinary
bladder [km for na⫹ and cl⫺ were ⬃25 and 13 mm,
respectively (15)]. the large central hydrophobic domain containing the 12 transmembrane segments of
the related na-k-2cl cotransporter has been shown to
determine the diuretic [in this case bumetanide] and
ion binding (20). because rat and flounder tsc exhibit
⬃80% amino acid identity in this central domain, it
seems likely that small changes in tsc sequences in
this region account for the kinetic differences between
these two tsc proteins.
in the dct, urinary fluid arrives from the loop of
henle with nacl concentrations and osmolarities
that are usually significantly lower than in plasma,
due to the intense reabsorption of ions, without water, in the thick ascending limb. thus, to maintain
an appropriate rate of salt reabsorption, the apically
expressed  xxxg2080xxx  in the dct must have
very high affinities for both cotransported ions. the
high na⫹ and cl⫺ affinities of ⬃8 mm for rtsc are
consistent with this model and with the previous
observations by velázquez and coworkers (31) using

functional characterization of rtsc

in vivo microperfusion experiments in rat dct in
which they found half-maximal stimulation of salt
transport at na⫹ or cl⫺ concentrations of ⬃10 mm.
in addition, any reduction of ion reabsorption in the
thick ascending limb or increased flow out of the loop
of henle will result in increased salt (and osmolarity)
delivery to dct. in this latter circumstance, the rate
of nacl transport has been shown to be directly
related to the rate of nacl delivery to the dct. in
this regard, we found in the present study that nacl
transport by tsc was regulated by osmolarity, independently of changes in nacl concentration or ionic
strength, at least in oocytes. thus it is possible that
osmotic-induced activation of tsc could be one of the
mechanisms that account for the known immediate
increase in nacl reabsorption rate in dct when a
loop diuretic is administered (4).
our functional study confirms the predictions
made by tran et al. (30) using [3h] xxxd2627xxx  binding analysis to renal cortical membranes and by
chang and fujita (5) using a recently developed
computer-based program that tsc possesses two
binding sites: one selective for na⫹ and another for
cl⫺. however, in contrast to their findings, we observed that the affinity of the cotransporter for na⫹
or cl⫺ is clearly affected by the concentration of the
counterion in the uptake medium. the km for na⫹ is
affected by cl⫺ and the apparent km for cl⫺ is
affected by extracellular na⫹. the higher the counterion concentration, the higher the na⫹ or cl⫺ affinity of the cotransporter. we suggest that these
results indicate that the order of binding for na⫹ and
cl⫺ to the cotransporter is random. as shown in the
appendix, to analyze the order of binding of both ions
to the cotransporter we followed the “rapid equilibrium” approach suggested by segel (28). according to
this model, in random bireactant systems, when ␣ ⫽
1, one ion has no effect on the binding of the other
and the apparent km (kapp) is held constant as the
counterion concentration increases; when ␣ ⬎ 1 the
binding of one ion decreases the affinity for the
second ion and the kapp increases as the concentration of counterion increases, and when ␣ ⬍ 1 the
binding of one ion increases the affinity of the cotransporter for the counterion, and the kapp for the
varied ion decreases as the concentration of the
fixed ion increases. thus the observed mutual effects
of na⫹ and cl⫺ concentration on kapp and vmax in our
results are characteristic for random binding of
these ions with an ␣ ⬍ 1. if the ion binding were
ordered, with na⫹ binding first, then we would expect that the vmax for chloride remains unaffected.
as table 1 and 2 show, the vmax for both ions was
affected by the concentration of the counterion.
the binding of the thiazide-like compound [3h] xxxd2627xxx  exclusively to cellular membranes from renal
cortex has been used for years as a surrogate to study
changes in cotransporter expression with modulation
of physiological conditions and during different pathophysiological states (1, 3, 6, 11–13). our results show
that tsc function is inhibited by several different

f167

thiazides with an inhibitory profile similar to their
potency in clinical medicine, as well as their potency to
block the [3h] xxxd2627xxx  binding to renal cortical
membranes (2). in addition, the benzothiadiazine derivative and vasodilator drug  xxxd1868xxx , which causes
vasodilation but does not cause diuresis, possesses no
inhibitory effect on tsc function.
our data show that the concentration of na⫹ as well
as cl⫺ in the extracellular medium affects the affinity
of rtsc for thiazides. the higher the concentration of
both ions, the lower the thiazide-induced inhibition of
rtsc function. for example, the ic50 for  xxxd2627xxx 
inhibition of rtsc was shifted by one order of magnitude to the left when either cl⫺ (fig. 5) or na⫹ (fig. 6)
in the extracellular uptake medium was decreased
from 100 to 2 mm. as shown in fig. 7, the higher the
na⫹ or cl⫺ concentration, the lower the rtsc inhibition by thiazides. on the one hand, our findings are in
agreement with the observations of tran and co-workers (30), who found an inhibitory effect of cl⫺ on
thiazide binding to renal cortical membranes, but otherwise diverge from their finding of a stimulatory effect
of na⫹ on thiazide binding. we show that both na⫹
and cl⫺ decrease the inhibitory potency of thiazides on
tsc, whereas tran and co-workers found that raising
the na⫹ concentration increases the binding of thiazides to plasma membranes from renal cortex (5, 30).
thus, regarding the na⫹ and thiazide interactions, our
result appears to be inconsistent with those of tran et
al. (30).
differences between predictions based on tracer diuretic binding to plasma membranes and analysis of
the cotransporter function have been shown to occur. it
was predicted by studies using [3h]bumetanide binding to renal outer medulla membranes that, in the
na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter, bumetanide binds to the
second cl⫺ site (17). however, recent studies of the
na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporters using chimeras and point
mutations demonstrate that altering the second transmembrane domain affects na⫹, k⫹, and bumetanide
kinetics, but not cl⫺ kinetics (18 –20). if bumetanide
and cl⫺ bind to the same site on the protein, the
kinetics of both should be affected by the same alterations in amino acid sequence. thus bumetanide binding to the na-k-2cl cotransporter appears to be distinct from the cl⫺-binding site.
finally, on the basis of our data, we propose a
modification of the presently accepted tsc model for
nacl transport and inhibition by thiazides. in this
revised  xxxg2080xxx  model, either ion can
first (and presumably randomly) bind to the transporter, but the binding of this first ion affects the
binding affinity of the second ion (or counterion). in
other words, the occupancy of either ion binding site
increases the probability for occupancy of the other
one. moreover, both ion binding sites alter thiazidemediated inhibition of transport, indicating that the
thiazide binding site is either shared or modified by
both na⫹ and cl⫺.

the dissociation constants for na⫹ and cl⫺, respectively, and
