[3h] xxxd2343xxx  bound to a single class of binding sites in pig renal cortex membranes with a dissociation constant
k d = 35 + 13 nm and a binding site density bm~x = 40 + 9 p m o l / m g of protein. [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was
inhibited by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, and by thiazide diuretics with the following rank order
of potency: chlorothiazide > hydrochlorothiazide --  xxxd2627xxx  >  xxxd2297xxx . the effect of the latter drugs to
inhibit [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was not related to their activity as thiazide diuretics, but was significantly correlated
with their inhibitory effect on  xxxg293xxx . these results suggest that the major renal binding site of
[3h] xxxd2343xxx  is a membrane form of carbonic anhydrase. inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may play a role in the
antihypertensive effect of  xxxd2343xxx .

1. introduction

the molecular mechanism of action of the
atypical thiazide diuretic,  xxxd2343xxx  (fig. 1), is
still not dearly established.
the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2343xxx  have
generally been ascribed to its diuretic properties
(allen, 1983), and  xxxd2343xxx  can interact with
the renal binding sites of the thiazide diuretic,
[3h] xxxd2627xxx  (fig. 1) (beaumont et al., 1988).
like classical thiazide diuretics,  xxxd2343xxx  was
thus thought to inhibit the electroneutral distal
tubule  xxxg2020xxx  transporter (allen, 1983; beaumont
et al., 1988). however, only 5% of  xxxd2343xxx  is
excreted unchanged through renal pathways

(campbell et al., 1977), thereby distinguishing  xxxd2343xxx  from other thiazide diuretics and suggesting that vasodilatory mechanisms independent
of diuresis may be more important for  xxxd2343xxx 
than for other thiazide derivatives. actually, indirect pharmacological (mironneau et al., 1981) and
electrophysiological (mironneau and gargouil,
1979) studies have suggested that  xxxd2343xxx  may
affect smooth muscle contraction by mechanisms
unrelated to its diuretic properties, possibly by
interacting with smooth muscle calcium channels.
we report the identification and pharmacological characterization of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding
sites in membranes from pig renal cortex and
discuss the implications of these observations in
relation to the mechanism of action of  xxxd2343xxx .

2. materials and methods

2.1. [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding studies
cortical tissue from pig kidney was homogenized with a polytron (3 times 5 s, position 5) in
ice-cold 50 mm tris/phosphate (ph 7.4) buffer.
the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of
the homogenate at 1000 × g for 15 min was
centrifuged again for 15 rain at 8000 × g. the
resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at
70000 × g for 30 min, and the final pellet was
resuspended in tris/phosphate (ph 7.4) buffer at
a protein concentration of 10 mg protein/ml and
stored at - 80 ° c.
binding studies were performed by incubating
renal membrane preparations (final concentration
0.5 mg protein/ml) with [3h] xxxd2343xxx  and
drugs for 2 h in tris/phosphate buffer in an
ice-cold water bath. bound radiohgand was isolated by rapid filtration of the incubation mixture
through whatman g f / c filters followed by two
washes with 5 ml of ice-cold tris/phosphate
buffer. the filters were treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine for at least 1 h before use. under these
conditions, specific [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding to
filters could not be detected. non-specific binding

was defined as [3h] xxxd2343xxx  bound in the presence of 100/~m of unlabelled  xxxd2343xxx .
association (k÷l) and dissociation (k_l) rate
constants for the interaction of [3h] xxxd2343xxx 
with its binding sites were determined by non-linear regression of the time course data fitted to the
equation b -- b~ (1 - e ( - k a p p t ) ) , where k a p p = k+l
[[3h] xxxd2343xxx ] + k 1 and b = [3h] xxxd2343xxx 
bound, b~ = [3h] xxxd2343xxx  bound at equilibrium, k+l and k_ 1 were calculated by linear
regression of k~pp versus [3h] xxxd2343xxx  concentration. all experimental points were obtained
in duplicate.

2.2. carbonic anhydrase inhibition studies
the hydrolytic activity of purified carbonic
anhydrase ii against p-nitrophenyl acetate was
assayed as described by pocker and janjic (1988).
briefly, bovine erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx 
(100 nm) was incubated for 20 min at 22°c with
1 mm of p-nitrophenyl acetate and drugs in 100
mm hepes/tris ph 7.4 buffer. the concentration of the p-nitrophenolate ion released by enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate was
determined spectrophotometrically at 400 nm (extinction coefficient c = 18400 cm -1 m -1) and did
not exceed 5% of the initial substrate concentration. results were corrected for the spontaneous
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate in the absence
of enzyme. as the substrate concentration (1 ram)
was lower than the k m of the enzyme for pnitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (k m = 6 mm), the
concentration of compounds producing 50% inhibition of enzyme activity could be considered to
be equal to the k i of the compounds for inhibition of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (maren et
al., 1976).

2.3. drugs
[3h] xxxd2343xxx  (specific activity 22 ci/mmol)
was a gift from drs. guez and schatz from
laboratoires servier (paris, france). bovine
erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx  and other drugs
were from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, usa).
all other reagents were analytical grade.

in fig. 2b (inset), the a p p a r e n t rate constant for
association of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  (kap~) was linearly

according to the equation k app = k+ l[[3h]indapa mide] + k _ 1 (r = 0.998), with k + l = 1.8 10 4 m -1

constant ( k d ) of the  xxxd2343xxx -receptor complex was calculated f r o m these kinetic constants to

be k d = k _ l / k + l = 2 0 nm and was in good
agreement with the k d value determined in equilibrium binding studies.
the effect of different diuretics on [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was then studied. as shown in
fig. 3 a and table 1, [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was
inhibited by furosemide and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, as well as by different thiazide diuretics, with the rank order of
potency chlorothiazide > hydrochlorothiazide =
 xxxd2627xxx  >  xxxd2297xxx . [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was not affected by up to 100/~m of
other diuretic compounds like bumetanide,
amiloride, ethylisopropylamiloride, phenamil,
 xxxd2049xxx ,  xxxd2723xxx  and triamterene.
the inhibition of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding by
low concentrations of acetazolamide and the rank
order of potency of thiazide diuretics were not
consistent with the idea that the [3h] xxxd2343xxx 
binding site is the thiazide receptor, but suggested
that [3h] xxxd2343xxx  bound to a carbonic anhydrase. therefore the activity of  xxxd2343xxx  and of
thiazide diuretics on the activity of bovine
erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx  was also assessed. as shown in fig. 3b, drugs that interacted
with [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding sites also inhibited

furthermore, inorganic anions like no3--, br-,
c1- and i-, which are known inhibitors of
carbonic anhydrase (maren et al., 1976), also inhibited [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding. as would be expected from these results, the potency of different
compounds as inhibitors of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding was significantly correlated with their k i as
inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (r = 0.98, slope

4. discussion

we identified high-affinity binding sites for
[3h] xxxd2343xxx  in pig renal cortex. although  xxxd2343xxx  has generally been reported to act
through the renal  xxxg2020xxx  transporter, the pharmacological characteristics of the [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding site identified in this study are not consistent
with those of the thiazide target site. the excellent
correlation between the effect of numerous organic
and inorganic compounds on [3h] xxxd2343xxx 
binding and on carbonic anhydrase provides con-

507

clusive evidence that the major renal [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding site has the properties of a
carbonic anhydrase. soluble carbonic anhydrase
would not be expected to persist in our membrane
preparations, and addition of soluble carbonic
anhydrase ii to the membranes did not increase
the binding of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  (not shown).
therefore the renal [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding site is
probably a membrane form of carbonic anhydrase,
like  xxxg295xxx  identified in human
kidney (mckinley and whitney, 1976) and lung
(whitney and briggle, 1982) and rat brain (sapirstein et al., 1983).
the question of the significance of these binding sites in the mechanism of action of [3h] xxxd2343xxx  arises. concentrations of  xxxd2343xxx 
acting on the renal  xxxg2020xxx  transporter identified
with [3h] xxxd2627xxx  (beaumont et al., 1988) and
on carbonic anhydrase (this study) are about the
same. however, the diuretic activity of  xxxd2343xxx  is very similar to that of the other thiazide
diuretics (allen, 1983), suggesting that carbonic
anhydrase inhibition may not play a major role in
the diuretic properties of  xxxd2343xxx .
although the diuretic properties of  xxxd2343xxx 
may explain its antihypertensive effects, there is
extensive evidence that other mechanisms of action may also contribute. thus, contrary to the
other thiazide derivatives, the urinary excretion of
 xxxd2343xxx  is very low (less than 5% of the initial
dose, campbell et al., 1977), suggesting that nonrenal sites of action may be more important for
 xxxd2343xxx  than for other thiazide or sulfonamide
diuretics. this is in line with the observation that
the antihypertensive properties of  xxxd2343xxx  are
apparent at concentrations which do not induce
significant diuresis (allen, 1983). interestingly, extracellular co 2 and h ÷ concentrations, which are
likely to be influenced by membrane carbonic
anhydrase, are important factors in the autoregulation of cerebral (kontos, 1981; wagner and
mishra, 1988), skeletal, and cardiac muscle (olsson, 1981) blood flow. accordingly, acetazolamide
has been reported to produce cerebral vasodilatation through inhibition at carbonic anhydrase and
subsequent effects on co 2 and h ÷ concentrations
(allen, 1983). these considerations, together with
the fact that the k i of  xxxd2343xxx  for carbonic

anhydrase reported in this study (400 nm) is one
order of magnitude lower than that for the putative effects of  xxxd2343xxx  on calcium channels
reported in electrophysiological studies (mironneau and gargouil, 1979), suggest strongly that
carbonic anhydrase inhibition may actually participate in the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2343xxx .
in conclusion, we have identified a [3h] xxxd2343xxx  binding site in pig renal cortex with the
characteristics of a membrane form of carbonic
anhydrase. the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase
may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of
 xxxd2343xxx  in addition to its well-known diuretic
properties.
inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the kidney
will indirectly lead to inhibition of the n a ÷ / h ÷
exchange system (morel et doucet, 1986), and
then to a decrease of na ÷ transport, which explains the well-known inhibition of naci reabsorption by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor,
acetazolamide (preisig et al., 1987).  xxxd2343xxx 
seems to exert its pharmacological effects by (i)
inhibiting a carbonic anhydrase, (ii) acting on the
thiazide-sensitive na ÷ transport system (presumably the n a + / ci- co-transport (greger, 1988))
previously identified with [3h] xxxd2627xxx  (beaumont et al., 1989).
