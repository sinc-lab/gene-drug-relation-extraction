interaction of 5-ht1b/d ligands with recombinant h 5-ht1a receptors:
intrinsic activity and modulation by g-protein activation state

received: 28 october 1997 / accepted: 14 february 1998

abstract many 5-ht1b/d receptor ligands have affinity for
5-ht1a receptors. in the present study, the intrinsic activity
of a series of 5-ht1b/d ligands was investigated at human  xxxg1108xxx  (h 5-ht1a) receptors by measuring g-protein activation in recombinant c6-glial and hela membranes, using
agonist-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas binding. in these two membrane preparations, the density of h 5-ht1a receptors (i.e.,
246 to 320 fmol mg–1 protein) and of their g-proteins, and
the receptor: g-protein density ratio (0.08 to 0.18) appeared
to be similar. it was found that: (i) the maximal [35s]gtpgammas
binding responses induced by the 5-ht1b/d receptor ligands
in the hela preparation at 30 µm gdp were comparable to
that of the native agonist 5-ht; (ii) as compared to 5-ht
(1.00), similar potencies but lower maximal responses were
observed in the c6-glial preparation at 0.3 µm gdp
for  xxxd3562xxx  (0.89), dihydroergotamine (0.81),  xxxd3135xxx  (0.71), cp122638 (0.69), naratriptan (0.60) and
sumatriptan (0.53); and that (iii) maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses induced by 5-ht1b/d ligands in the c6-glial
preparation were either unaffected or significantly enhanced by increasing the gdp concentration from 0.3 to
30 µm and higher concentrations. these features differ
from those observed with  xxxg1108xxx  agonists; the latter display the same rank order of potency and efficacy in
both membrane preparations, and increasing the amount of
gdp with c6-glial membranes results in an attenuation of
both the agonist’s maximal effect and the apparent potency
of partial agonists. the differential regulation of 5-ht1a
and 5-ht1b/d agonist responses by gdp suggests that different g-protein subtypes are involved upon  xxxg1108xxx  activation by 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b/d agonists.

introduction
the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht) elicits diverse physiological responses in the mammalian central nervous system through multiple distinct
receptor subtypes (hoyer et al. 1994). of these, 5-ht1a receptors have been extensively investigated and characterized in many pharmacological, biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral studies using, in particular, the
5-ht1a agonist 8-(hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl)aminotetralin
(8-oh-dpat; hjorth et al. 1982; gozlan et al. 1983). the
 xxxg1108xxx  belongs to a superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors that consist of a single polypeptide chain with
seven putative transmembrane domains, characteristic of
receptors coupled to heterotrimeric g-proteins (julius
1991). the interaction between 5-ht1a receptors and gproteins has been studied indirectly by the modulatory effect of gtp or its nonhydrolysable analogs on agonist binding sites labeled by [3h] 8-oh-dpat (golzan et al. 1983;
hall et al. 1985; schlegel and peroutka 1986; harrington
and peroutka 1990). the involvement of pertussis toxinsensitive g-proteins (gi and/or go) in the 5-ht1a receptormediated response was demonstrated by utilizing pertussis
toxin-catalyzed adp ribosylation of these types of proteins
(andrade et al. 1986; clarke et al. 1987; harrington et al.
1988; okada et al. 1989).
the interaction between 5-ht1a receptors and g-proteins allows to investigate more directly the receptor-mediated functional activation of g-proteins or receptor-g-protein coupling. this is possible with an agonist-stimulated
gtp hydrolyzing assay (milligan 1988) or by monitoring
the high affinity binding of a non-hydrolysable analogue of
gtp, such as [35s]gtpgammas, providing a measure of agonist
efficacy (bertin et al. 1992; newman-tancredi et al. 1996,
1997a,b; stanton and beer 1997; pauwels et al. 1997). in
the case of human 5-ht1a (h 5-ht1a) receptor-transfected
c6-glial cells and amongst the 5-ht receptor agonists that
were being investigated (pauwels et al. 1997), only the nonselective 5-ht agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct;
hoyer et al. 1994) and the 5-ht1a/b/d receptor agonist 2-[5-

491

[3-(4-methylsulphonylamino)benzyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]1h-indol-3-yl]ethanamine (l694247; beer et al. 1993) displayed an efficacy similar to that of 5-ht at this receptor.
other agents (e.g., 8-oh-dpat and flesinoxan) acted as
apparently partial agonists at the h  xxxg1108xxx  and increasing the amount of gdp resulted in an attenuation both
of the maximal effect and of the apparent potency of these
partial agonists. the finding that efficacy differences were
magnified by increasing gdp concentration also suggests
that a guanine nucleotide affinity component is involved in
the determination of agonist efficacy. similar observations
were recently reported for the maximal effects of µ-opiate
receptor agonists (selley et al. 1997). therefore, it is conceivable that in addition to the receptor:g-protein density
ratio and the intrinsic ability of an agonist to activate the receptor, the activity state of the g-proteins co-determines the
magnitude of responses produced by 5-ht1a ligands at their
receptors.
other than 5-ht1a agonists, a number of 5-ht1b/d agonists also bind to 5-ht1a receptors (pauwels et al. 1997;
newman-tancredi et al. 1997c). the aim of the present
study was to explore the  xxxg1108xxx -mediated g-protein activation by 5-ht1b/d receptor ligands. membrane
preparations of transfected c6-glial and hela cells with h
5-ht1a receptors (pauwels et al. 1997) were used for this
purpose. the experiments analysed the relationship between ligand efficacy and the activated state of g-proteins
which was modulated by varying the gdp concentration.
the maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses to different 5ht1b/d receptor agonists in membranes from recombinant
c6-glial cells were found not to be attenuated by increasing
the gdp concentration. the present data are discussed in
view of those previously obtained with 5-ht1a agonists
(pauwels et al. 1997).

materials and methods
cell lines with stable expression of human 5-ht1a receptors. the hela/ha7 cell line containing the prk7/h  xxxg1108xxx  plasmid and stably
expressing h 5-ht1a receptors (fargin et al. 1989) was cultured as
previously described (pauwels et al. 1993). c6-glial cells stably transfected with a pcdna3/h 5-ht1a plasmid (wurch et al. 1996) were
cultured as described elsewhere (pauwels et al. 1997), and used for
the [3h]8-oh-dpat and [35s]-gtpgammas binding assays.
[3h]8-oh-dpat binding experiments. membrane preparations of the
hela/ha7 and c6-glial/5-ht1a cell lines were prepared in 50 mm
tris-hcl ph 7.7 containing 4 mm cacl2, 10 mm  xxxd2850xxx  and 0.1%
 xxxd228xxx  as described previously (pauwels et al. 1996). binding
assays were performed with 1 nm [3h] 8-oh-dpat. incubation mixtures consisted of 0.4 ml cell membrane preparation (60 to 110 µg),
0.05 ml radioligand and 0.05 ml compound for inhibition or 1 mm
spiroxatrine to determine nonspecific binding. the reactions were
stopped after a 30 min incubation at 25°c by adding 3.0 ml ice-cold
50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.7 and rapid filtration over whatman gf/b
glass fiber filters using a brandel harvester, washed and counted as
described (pauwels et al. 1996). data were analysed graphically with
inhibition curves, and ic50-values (concentration of the compound
producing 50% inhibition of specific binding) were derived. ki values
were calculated according to the equation ki=ic50/(1+c/kd) with c
the concentration and kd the equilibrium dissociation constant of [3h]
8-oh-dpat. saturation [3h] 8-oh-dpat binding experiments were
performed as described (pauwels et al. 1993).

[35s]gtpgammas binding responses with membrane preparations of h  xxxg1108xxx  receptor transfected c6-glial and hela cell lines. cells were
collected in phosphate-buffered-saline (ph 7.4) and centrifuged for
20 min at 48,000 g. the pellet was homogenised with a polytron in 20
mm hepes containing 10 mm edta (ph 7.4) and recentrifuged for
10 min at 48,000 g. the resulting pellet was washed twice in 20 mm
hepes (ph 7.4) containing 0.1 mm edta. the pellet was stored at
–80°c in fractions of 1500 µg protein. for [35s]gtpgammas binding assays, the pellet was thawed, diluted 20-fold in 20 mm hepes (ph 7.4)
supplemented with either 0.3, 30 or 300 µm of gdp, 100 mm nacl,
3 mm mgcl2 and 0.2 mm  xxxd228xxx . incubation mixtures were
prepared in glass tubes and consisted of 0.4 ml of membrane preparation (30 to 90 µg of protein) and 0.05 ml of compound. after an incubation period of 30 min at 25°c, 0.05 ml [35s]gtpgammas (500 pm) was
added for an additional period of 30 min. the reactions were stopped
by adding 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mm hepes (ph 7.4) containing 3 mm
mgcl2 and rapid filtration over whatmann gf/b glass fiber filters using a brandel harvester. the filters were rinced three additional times
with 3 ml hepes buffer, placed in scintillation vials and the radioactivity was extracted in 4 ml of emulsifier-safe. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 10 µm unlabeled gtpgammas. maximal
stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding was defined in the presence of
10 µm 5-ht and emax values were expressed as a percentage there of,
ec50 values were defined as the concentration of compound at which
50% of its own maximal stimulation was obtained. saturation
[35s]gtpgammas binding experiments were performed as previously described (pauwels et al., 1998) using non-linear regression analysis
(ligand).

dye-binding assay using the bio-rad kit (bradford 1976). bovine  xxxg124xxx  was used as a standard.
statistical analysis. statistical analysis was performed on the emax values of the investigated ligands between hela and c6-glial membrane
preparations, and at the various concentrations of gdp with the nonparametric mann-whitney u-test.

saturation binding experiments with [3h] 8-oh-dpat on
membrane preparations of c6-glial and hela cells stably
transfected with a h  xxxg1108xxx  gene are compatible
with the presence of a single high affinity binding site (fig.
1) with similar affinity for [3h] 8-oh-dpat (pkd: 9.12,
95% cl: 0.22 and 9.28, 95% cl: 0.10 for c6-glial and hela preparations, respectively). the maximal binding capacity for [3h] 8-oh-dpat in the two cell lines appeared similar, 246±11 and 320±91 fmol mg–1 protein for the hela
and c6-glial preparation, respectively. figure 2 shows nonlinear regression analysis of basal and 5-ht-stimulated
[35s]gtpgammas binding to membranes of c6-glial cells in the
presence of either 0.3 or 30 µm gdp. relatively little high
affinity [35s]gtpgammas binding was observed in the absence of
5-ht as demonstrated by both the homologous displacement of [35s]gtpgammas binding by increasing concentrations
of gtpgammas and non-linear regression analysis of the data.
the addition of 5-ht (10 µm) produced 52 and 222% stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding above basal levels in the
presence of 0.3 and 30 µm of gdp, respectively. the 5-ht
stimulation resulted in a biphasic scatchard plot with an increase in high affinity [35s]gtpgammas binding and almost no
change in low affinity [35s]gtpgammas binding. analysis of 5ht-specific-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas binding indicated a single class of high affinity [35s]gtpgammas binding sites. the corresponding pkd and bmax values for each of these conditions are summarized in table 1. a similar non-linear regression analysis of basal and 5-ht-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas

cp122638 for stimulation of
[35s]gtpgammas binding to c6-glial
and hela membranes with
h 5-ht1a receptors. binding was
performed in the presence of either 0.3, 30 or 300 µm gdp as
described in methods. stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding is
expressed as a percentage of that
obtained with 10 µm 5-ht at
the corresponding gdp concentration. curves were constructed
using mean values ±sem from 3
to 6 independent experiments,
each one performed in triplicate.
mean emax and pec50 values are
summarized in table 2. c6-glial

300 (▼) µm of gdp; hela
membranes: 30 µm gdp (∆). insets illustrate emax values of
[35s]gtpgammas binding responses
versus gdp concentration (c6glial membranes: ●; hela

density of high affinity [35s]gtpgammas binding sites is 2.7-fold
lower than that in the c6-glial preparation (table 1).
comparison between [35s]gtpgammas binding responses
to  xxxd2498xxx , dihydroergotamine and 5-ht1b/d receptor
ligands in recombinant hela
and c6-glial membrane preparations
a comparison between the concentration-effect curves of
 xxxd2498xxx , dihydroergotamine and various 5-ht1b/d ligands
that yielded stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding in hela and
c6-glial membranes with that of r(+)-8-oh-dpat is
shown in figs. 4 and 5. the corresponding emax and pec50
values under conditions of either 0.3, 30 and 300 µm gdp
are summarized with those of 5-ht and flesinoxan in table
2, and compared with their pki values for the h  xxxg1108xxx . each of the ligands dose-dependently increased
[35s]gtpgammas binding in both hela and c6-glial preparations. besides  xxxd2498xxx  and dihydroergotamine, the rank order of potency for stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding of the
other ligands was in both cell lines and at the different concentrations of gdp similar to competition binding at the h
 xxxg1108xxx . agonist potencies were 5- to 12-times inferior to the corresponding pki values for the h  xxxg1108xxx  with the exception of dihydroergotamine and  xxxd2498xxx  as measured in the hela preparation. similar agonist
potencies were observed with each of these ligands in the
c6-glial preparation at 0.3 µm gdp. the potencies were attenuated in the c6-glial preparation in the presence of 30
µm gdp; this was particularly evident for 5-ht, naratriptan,  xxxd2498xxx  and cp122638.

the maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses of the various ligands could be less well differentiated in the hela
preparation compared to the c6-glial preparation. whereas
the responses of cp122638, r(+)-8-oh-dpat,  xxxd3135xxx 
and flexinoxan yielded a maximum between 75 and 88%
compared to that of 5-ht in the hela preparation at 30 µm
gdp, the other ligands being investigated attained maximal
responses between 95 and 100%.  xxxd2498xxx  was the only
compound that displayed similar maximal responses in hela and c6-glial preparation regardless of the gdp concentration that was used. r(+)-8-oh-dpat (fig. 4b) and
flesinoxan (table 2) showed a similar maximal response in
hela (30 µm gdp) and c6-glial (0.3 µm gdp) preparation, however their maximal responses were attenuated by
41 and 21% (p<0.05) in the c6-glial preparation in the
presence of 30 µm gdp and higher concentrations (fig.
4a). the maximal effects of  xxxd3562xxx , dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  were similar in the c6glial preparation at 0.3 and 30 µm of gdp; however they
were inferior (10 to 42%, p<0.05) compared to the hela
preparation at 30 µm gdp (fig. 5). the maximal
[35s]gtpgammas binding responses of cp 122638 and naratriptan in the c6-glial preparation were also not attenuated by increasing the gdp concentration. indeed, they were
respectively 17 and 28% higher (p<0.05) at 30 than 0.3 µm
gdp (table 2). each of these [35s]gtpgammas binding responses, measured at 30 µm gdp in the c6-glial preparation,
were antagonised by 10 nm of the selective 5-ht1a antagonist way 100635 (not shown). a final set of experiments
was performed at an even higher gdp concentration (300
µm) in order to examine the gdp dependency of maximal
[35s]gtpgammas binding responses of 5-ht1b/d ligands. with

discussion
the present study reports on the intrinsic activity of 5ht1b/d receptor agonists at h 5-ht1a receptors as measured
by agonist-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas binding to membrane
preparations containing recombinant h 5-ht1a receptors.
we have previously shown that membrane preparations of
c6-glial and hela cell lines displayed the same rank order
of potency and efficacy for a number of different  xxxg1108xxx  agonists (pauwels et al. 1997). differences between
the maximal responses of the various  xxxg1108xxx  agonists were more pronounced in the c6-glial preparation; increasing the amount of gdp resulted in an attenuation of
both the maximal effect and the apparent potency of the
partial agonists. therefore, almost all of the investigated  xxxg1108xxx  receptor ligands exerting intrinsic activity at h 5-ht1a
receptors acted as partial agonists, and thus differed from
the native agonist 5-ht. this has been clearly documented
for flesinoxan, 8-oh-dpat and its enantiomers (pauwels
et al. 1997). interestingly, mc loughin and strange (1997)
showed that a recombinant cho/h  xxxg1108xxx  membrane preparation was also capable, at 3 µm gdp, to differentiate between the maximal effects of 5-ht and those of 5carboxamidotryptamine or 8-oh-dpat. in the present
study, we have identified experimental conditions in which
 xxxd3562xxx , dihydroergotamine, naratriptan,  xxxd2498xxx  and
cp122638 yield greater maximal  xxxg1108xxx -mediat-

ed responses in comparison to flesinoxan and r(+)-8-ohdpat.
the observed [35s]gtpgammas binding responses of the 5ht1b/d ligands in hela and c6-glial membranes are mediated by a  xxxg1108xxx : (i) the absence of a 5-ht-mediated [35s]gtpgammas binding response in the nontransfected
cell types together with a lack of specific [3h]8-oh-dpat
binding (pauwels et al. 1997); (ii) the blockade of the diverse agonist-mediated [35s]gtpgammas binding responses by
the selective 5-ht1a antagonist way100635; and (iii) the
observed agonist order of potency for stimulation of
[35s]gtpgammas binding in line with competition binding at the
h  xxxg1108xxx . the maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses to the various 5-ht1b/d receptor ligands tested here
in the hela preparation, at 30 µm gdp, were comparable
to those produced by the native agonist 5-ht. newmantancredi et al. (1997c) obtained similar results for
sumatriptan and naratriptan using a recombinant cho
membrane preparation containing h 5-ht1a receptors in the
presence of 3 µm of gdp. otherwise, the [35s]gtpgammas binding responses to 5-ht1b/d receptor ligands could be differentiated in the c6-glial preparation. in addition, their maximal responses were differentially attenuated compared to
the hela preparation. in particular, the responses to
sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  were attenuated to about 60% of
the maximal 5-ht response. this observation underlines
the notion that the failure to observe a difference in apparent ligand efficacy in a particular model system does not
necessarily preclude the absence of such a difference, only
that the system was inadequate to make it observable. thus,
under the conditions used in the present study, the c6-glial
preparation in comparison to the hela cells, was found to
have a higher capacity to resolve differences in maximal re-

497

sponses of ligands at h 5-ht1a receptors. in contrast with
the  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists, the maximal responses to  xxxd3562xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  were apparently not attenuated by increasing the gdp concentration
up to 30 µm. moreover, the maximal responses to naratriptan and cp122638 were greater at 30 µm than at 0.3
µm gdp. this illustrates that even in a particular model
system, experimental conditions may be critical to the analysis of ligand-induced receptor: g-protein interactions. the
maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses to the nonselective
agonists  xxxd2498xxx  and dihydroergotamine were similar to
that of  xxxd3562xxx . their maximal responses were also resistant to gdp regulation by modulation between 0.3 and
300 µm.  xxxd2498xxx  has been reported to be a highly efficacious agonist in a recombinant cho/h 5-ht1a membrane
preparation, where its maximal response was similar to that
of 5-ht and greater than 8-oh-dpat (mc loughin and
strange 1997).
the present study demonstrates that at a gdp concentration of 30 µm, there is a 2.7-fold difference in maximal gprotein labeling between hela and c6-glial membranes
upon stimulation by 5-ht. it is important to note that analysis of [35s]gtpgammas binding actually measures the competition of a radioligand ([35s]gtpgammas) for a nonlabeled ligand
(gdp) under nonequilibrium conditions. these conditions
are necessary to measure agonist-stimulated binding (selley et al. 1997). this type of analysis is not quantitative accurate in the sense that a given bmax represents the exact
maximal number of g-proteins that are capable of being activated by the agonist-occupied receptor. however, this type
of analysis is useful for relative comparisons (selley et al.
1997). the apparently higher g-protein number in the c6glial preparation, together with the observed h  xxxg1108xxx  densities, results in a receptor: g-protein density ratio of approximately 0.08 and 0.18 for c6-glial and hela
membranes, respectively. these ratios are inferior to those
reported by newman-tancredi et al. (1997b), who found
them to be 1.4 and 4, depending on the culture conditions
used for the recombinant cho cells. these authors also
found that a 3-fold increase in receptor: g-protein density
ratio was sufficient to augment the apparent potency of full
agonists, increase the efficacy of partial agonists, and, to increase the negative efficacy of inverse agonists at h 5-ht1a
receptors in cho cells. our present observations suggest
that under similar  xxxg1108xxx : g-protein density ratios
as measured by 5-ht stimulation, differences can be found
in the maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses for 5-ht1b/d
ligands between hela and c6-glial membranes.
5-ht1a receptors mediate a variety of cell-specific responses (e.g., inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, stimulation of phospholipase c activity and closing of ca++ channels) via discrete g-protein-effector systems (liu and albert 1991; lembo et al. 1997). raymond et al. (1993) have
shown that the  xxxg1108xxx  can physically couple to
multiple, distinct gi proteins in hela cell membranes and
that 8-oh-dpat-mediated functional coupling to adenylyl
cyclase inhibition may be mediated by gialpha1, gialpha2 and
gialpha3. selective activation of inhibitory g-protein alpha-subunits by the partial agonists rauwolscine and ipsapirone of

the h  xxxg1108xxx  has been suggested using a photoreactive gtp analog, 4-azidoanilido-[alpha-32p]-gtp, and
plasma membranes from recombinant chinese hamster
ovary cells (gettys et al. 1994). we postulate that different
g-protein subtypes are involved in  xxxg1108xxx  activation by 5-ht1b/d and  xxxg1108xxx  ligands. the g-protein subtypes activated principally by  xxxg1108xxx 
ligands are likely to be present at a same receptor:g protein
density ratio for both investigated cell lines, whereas the ratio for the g-protein subtypes activated by 5-ht1b/d ligands
may be different. this difference may explain the distinct
pharmacological responses observed between both cell lines.
the differential regulation of the maximal agonist responses by gdp suggests that the [35s]gtpgammas binding responses of the various ligands are mediated by diverse gprotein subtypes upon activation of the h  xxxg1108xxx .
a single  xxxg1108xxx  is likely to adopt multiple binding
sites for diverse agonists. as a consequence, the activated
receptor could promote multiple and distinct conformations, thereby coupling to diverse  xxxg2224xxx -protein subtypes,
which in turn could activate a particular g-protein: effector
pathway. these various  xxxg2224xxx -proteins may have different
dissociation constants with regard to gdp, thus explaining
the differential effects of gdp on [35s]gtpgammas binding responses for the different types of 5-ht ligands.
two structural subgroups can be distinguished within the
5-ht1b/d ligands being investigated: the tryptamine derivatives sumatriptan,  xxxd3135xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx , which display a similar maximal response at 0.3 and 30 µm gdp, and
the conformationally restricted analogues of tryptamine, naratriptan and cp122638, which yield a greater maximal response at 30 than 0.3 µm gdp. this indicates that structurally distinct 5-ht1b/d ligands can be differentiated in the
functional [35s]gtpgammas binding response. both subgroups of
5-ht1b/d ligands also show responses of different magnitudes using autoradiography of  xxxg1108xxx -activated
g-proteins in guinea-pig brain sections (dupuis et al.,
1998). naratriptan and cp122638 stimulate [35s]gtpgammas
binding in the hippocampus, lateral septum and dorsal raphe
of guinea-pig brain sections, to an extent similar to that observed with the highly efficacious 5-ht1a agonist l694247
(pauwels et al. 1997). moreover, these compounds stimulate
g-protein activation via guinea-pig 5-ht1a receptors with
an apparently higher magnitude than the 5-ht1a partial agonists 8-oh-dpat and flesinoxan. this observation fits
with the maximal [35s]gtpgammas binding responses found in
the c6-glial preparation. otherwise,  xxxd3562xxx  induces
only a partial [35s]gtpgammas binding response in the guineapig hippocampus (48 to 50% versus l694247; dupuis et al.,
1998). sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  stimulate even less
[35s]gtpgammas binding in the guinea-pig hippocampus (20 to
35% versus l694247, dupuis et al., 1998), in accordance
with the weaker responses which these ligands produced in
the c6-glial preparation. taken together, it appears that the
5-ht1b/d ligands tested here consist of two structurally distinct subgroups which behave differently at the recombinant
h  xxxg1108xxx  in c6-glial cells and native 5-ht1a receptors in guinea-pig brain.

498

in vivo evidence for  xxxg1108xxx -mediated effects of
5-ht1b/d ligands is scarce. pagniez et al. (1998) recently
observed that sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  elicit dose-dependent and marked hypotension and bradycardia in the normotensive anaesthetized rat, predominantly via activation
of central 5-ht1a receptors and reduction of sympathetic
vascular tone.  xxxd3562xxx , a compound reported to readily cross the blood brain barrier (goadsby and edvinsson
1994), failed to induce major haemodynamic effects
(pagniez et al. 1998).  xxxg1108xxx -mediated effects of
5-ht1b/d receptor ligands may be difficult to observe in in
vivo experimental conditions simply because of their preferential affinity for 5-ht1b/d receptors versus 5-ht1a receptors.
in conclusion, some 5-ht1b/d ligands demonstrate substantial efficacy at h 5-ht1a receptors in recombinant cell
lines in a manner distinct from that of 5-ht1a agonists. the
hypothesis that different g-protein subtypes are involved in
mediating  xxxg1108xxx  activation in response to different agonists opens new perspectives for pharmacological
diversity through a single receptor.
