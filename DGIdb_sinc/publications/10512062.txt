 xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx , engineered  xxxd2207xxx  monoclonal antibodies
to the interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor a-subunit, were approved to prevent acute
rejection after renal transplantation.  xxxd1798xxx  was studied in adult and
pediatric renal allograft recipients, liver allograft recipients, and calcineurinsparing protocols in renal transplant recipients.  xxxd286xxx  was studied in
renal allograft recipients and subgroups of recipients of living-related and
cadaveric transplants, and in patients with diabetes mellitus. both agents
reduced acute rejection and were associated with few adverse effects.
however, information regarding their long-term effects on infection,
malignancy, chronic rejection, and patient survival must be available before a
final decision is made regarding their proper administration. we propose that
a likely role the drugs will play in the field of solid organ transplantation is in
new protocols that allow sparing of other more toxic immunosuppressive
agents.

graft and patient survival rates in solid organ
transplantation have increased dramatically.
these improved results were achieved, in part, by
increasing knowledge of transplant immunology
that allowed for the design of more specific
prophylactic therapies against acute allograft
rejection. several biologically engineered
antibodies were developed for rejection
prophylaxis, including  xxxd2676xxx  cd3 ( xxxd2676xxx )
and antithymocyte globulin (atg); however,
they have characteristics that may preclude their
use, such as cytokine release syndrome, a
common first-dose reaction to  xxxd2676xxx  due to mass
release of cytokines after opsonization and
destruction of mature t cells, and serum
sickness, a flu-like syndrome response to the
administration of foreign proteins that is caused
by deposition of immune complexes. all potent
immunosuppressive agents can increase the risk
of developing cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease
and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease
(ptld).1 in addition, any nonhuman protein is
immunogenic in humans, and it often results in

1128

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 10, 1999

formation of antibodies to the foreign protein,
known as antiidiotype antibodies. in some cases,
these antibodies may be present in high enough
titers to preclude administration of the agent.2
the newest prophylactic therapies to be
approved target the interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor
a (il-2ra) subunit on the human t cell that is
integral in the acute rejection process.
interleukin-2 is a cytokine produced by t
lymphocytes and is responsible for the growth
and differentiation of t and b lymphocytes. it is
important in the rejection process because it
serves as the intercellular communicator that
stimulates cytolytic t cells to attack the allograft.
the allograft releases foreign antigens that are
recognized by the immune system and presented
to t lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells.
the t lymphocytes become activated and release
il-2. interleukin-2 stimulates growth of clonal t
and b lymphocytes that are specific for the
antigen on the allograft, and activates these cells
to release more il-2, further magnifying the
inflammatory response. the other t and b
lymphocytes also become activated to attack the
allograft. they migrate to the graft and cause
damage by releasing their proinflammatory
intracellular contents and by occluding the graft’s
vasculature. proinflammatory chemicals are
chemotactic and draw additional lymphocytes
and macrophages to the graft. if left untreated,
vascular stasis will result and the vessels will
become thrombotic and unable to support the
graft.1, 2
interleukin-2 is the messenger for many parts
of the acute rejection process. for messages to
be transmitted from cell to cell, il-2 must bind to
the  xxxg1175xxx  on the receiving cell. the
receptor is expressed only on activated t cells
and consists of three transmembrane protein
chains: a (cd25), b ( xxxg1175xxx ), and g ( xxxg1176xxx )
(figure 1).2, 3 also known as the  xxxg1174xxx ,
il-2ra must associate with the b-subunit to
form the il-2 binding site. binding of il-2 with
the receptor transduces a signal across the cell
membrane and triggers t lymphocytes to
undergo clonal expansion. engineered antibody
products directed at this receptor are designed to
block the activation of antigen-specific t
lymphocytes selectively by binding the a-subunit
and inhibiting formation of the complete binding
site, therefore inhibiting binding of il-2 and
transduction of the signal.2
murine-derived monoclonal antibodies were
developed against il-2ra, and they reduce the
frequency of acute rejection in humans.

unfortunately, they are associated with several
limitations including a short circulating half-life
that necessitates daily dosing, and development
of antiidiotype antibodies due to the host
response to the foreign murine protein.4, 5 it also
is hypothesized that murine antibodies may be
less efficient activators of human effector
functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity.5
recently approved il-2ra antagonists were
biologically engineered to contain more human
genetic regions and fewer murine-derived
regions.  xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx  are
theorized to have two advantages: less sensitization because they have less mouse-derived
protein, and increased clinical utility in humans.6, 7
they have several proposed mechanisms of
action including promotion of antibodydependent cytotoxicity, t cell elimination by
long-term il-2 depravation, down-regulation of
 xxxg1175xxx  expression, increased shedding of
the bound il-2ra chain, and possible redistribution changes of lymphocyte recirculation. 8
the agents may be an improvement on purely
murine-derived compounds since they have a
long half-life and lack immunogenicity.6, 7

 xxxg1175xxx  antagonists in solid organ transplantation berard et al
 xxxd1798xxx  (zenapax; hoffmann-la roche,
nutley, nj) was the first il-2ra antagonist
approved by the food and drug administration
(fda) in december 1997. 9 it is a modified
human igg1 monoclonal antibody consisting of
90% human and 10% murine amino acid
sequences. the murine sequences are the
complementarity-determining regions to cd25
and are fused with human constant and variable
regions of the igg molecule. saturation of  xxxg1174xxx  by  xxxd1798xxx , and subsequent blockage of
t cell activation, occurs at serum levels of 5–10
µg/ml. at the recommended biweekly dose, the
il-2ra subunit was estimated to remain
saturated for approximately 12 weeks after
transplantation.6 in kidney transplant recipients,
peak serum concentrations are 20.9 ± 14.4 µg/ml
(sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
after the first 1-mg/kg dose and 31.9 ± 22.0 µg/ml
after the fifth dose. trough concentrations before
the fifth dose are estimated to be 7.6 ± 4.0
µg/ml.10
additional pharmacokinetic data were
evaluated in a phase i trial of 12 patients (mean
age 45 yrs) who were randomized to receive one
of four regimens: 0.5 or 1 mg/kg either weekly
or biweekly.6 over a weight range of 40–120 kg,
the mean volume of distribution of  xxxd1798xxx 
was 5.3 l, suggesting that the drug has limited
penetration into the extravascular space. the
terminal half-life ranges from 11.4–20 days and
allows administration every 14 days. 6, 8 it is
indicated as concomitant therapy with
cyclosporine and corticosteroids for prophylaxis
of acute rejection in renal allograft recipients.
the recommended weight-based dosage is 1
mg/kg (maximum 100 mg/dose) infused
intravenously over 15 minutes every 14 days for
five doses. the first dose should be given no
more than 24 hours before transplantation.
dosage adjustments for differences in age, race,
gender, or degree of proteinuria are not
recommended9 but have not been studied.
clinical trials
adult renal allograft recipients
the efficacy of  xxxd1798xxx  was studied in two
phase iii trials. in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial at centers in the united
states, canada, and sweden, adults were eligible
if they were recipients of a primary cadaveric
renal transplant. 8 exclusion criteria were
transplantation of more than one organ and
positive cross-match for t lymphocytes. patients

1129

received immunosuppressive therapy consisting
of cyclosporine (target trough concentration not
specified), azathioprine, and prednisone.
 xxxd1798xxx  or placebo was administered as five
doses of 1 mg/kg intravenously infused over 15
minutes, beginning within 24 hours before and 2,
4, 6, and 8 weeks after transplantation.
the primary end point of the study was
frequency of biopsy-confirmed rejection 6
months postoperatively. secondary end points
were 1-year patient and graft survival, time to
first episode of acute rejection, number of acute
rejection episodes per patient, frequency of
steroid-resistant rejection (defined as failure to
respond to intravenous methyprednisolone and
subsequent antilymphocyte therapy), graft
function (assessed by serum creatinine and
glomerular filtration rate as measured by iohexol,
radioisotope, or inulin clearance), and cumulative
prednisone dosage 6 months after transplantation.
statistical analyses were performed with
stratification according to center. all patients
who were assigned to a treatment group were
included in the analyses of efficacy and safety in
an intent-to-treat fashion.
of 260 patients enrolled, 126 received
 xxxd1798xxx  and 134 placebo. all patients
received at least one dose of study drug, and 107
patients in each group received all five doses.
the frequency of biopsy-documented acute
rejection during the first 6 months after
transplantation was approximately 37% lower in
the  xxxd1798xxx  group than in the placebo group.
in addition,  xxxd1798xxx -treated patients had
fewer mean rejection episodes per patient, and
time to rejection was significantly delayed. oneyear graft and patient survival rates were slightly
higher in the  xxxd1798xxx  group, but they did not
reach statistical significance. of interest, the
frequency of steroid-resistant rejection was
almost double in the placebo group, but this did
not reach statistical significance. no other
statistically significant differences were seen
between groups in secondary end points. in
addition, the groups did not differ in the daily
dose of prednisone or cyclosporine or in whole
blood trough concentrations of cyclosporine at
any time during the study (table 1).
 xxxd1798xxx  was not associated with any
immediate side effects. adverse effects in the
groups did not differ significantly, but serious
effects in both groups (complications that
required or prolonged hospitalization) were fever,
sepsis or bacteremia, pneumonia, local fungal
infection, local infection, any viral infection, and

cmv infection. no cytokine-release syndrome or
formation of antiidiotype antibodies occurred
during 1-year follow-up.  xxxd1798xxx  resulted in
fewer episodes of acute rejection and a trend
toward improved short-term graft survival.
a phase iii international, randomized,
multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial was conducted in 275 adult recipients of
primary cadaveric renal transplants.3 patients in
19 centers in europe, canada, and australia
received immunosuppressive therapy with
cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  xxxd1798xxx  or
placebo 1 mg/kg/dose was administered
intravenously for five doses beginning preoperatively and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks postoperatively.
the primary end point was frequency of
biopsy-proved rejection at 6 months. secondary
end points were patient and graft survival, time
to first episode of graft rejection, number of acute
rejection episodes per patient, graft function as
measured by serum creatinine and glomerular
filtration rate, and need for antilymphocyte or
corticosteroid treatment for rejection. safety was
assessed by spontaneously reported adverse
events and immunosuppression-related events
such as infections and malignancies. patients
were required to withdraw from the study if they

received antilymphocyte therapy or discontinued
cyclosporine. they were allowed to receive
azathioprine at the discretion of the investigator.
all randomized patients who received a
transplant were included in the primary analysis
based on an intent-to-treat design. of 275
patients, 141 received  xxxd1798xxx  and 134
received placebo. all patients received at least
one dose of study drug, and 82% of daclizumaband 83% of placebo-treated patients received all
five doses. the frequency of biopsy-proved
rejection at 6 months was approximately 40%
lower in  xxxd1798xxx  recipients. in contrast to
the previous trial, 1-year patient survival was
statistically significantly greater in the
 xxxd1798xxx  group than in the placebo group.
however, graft survival was not significantly
different, which suggests that factors other than
 xxxd1798xxx  likely contributed to higher patient
survival. patients treated with  xxxd1798xxx  had
significantly fewer mean acute rejection episodes
and fewer second episodes of rejection. adverse
effects and the frequency of infection did not
differ between groups.  xxxd1798xxx  was not
associated with cytokine-release syndrome,
increased fungal or cmv infections, or
malignancies.

 xxxg1175xxx  antagonists in solid organ transplantation berard et al
it is interesting to note that survival at 1 year
in patients who received double immunosuppression (cyclosporine and steroids) was
relatively similar to that in patients treated with
triple therapy (cyclosporine, steroids, and
azathioprine).3, 8 this indicates that  xxxd1798xxx 
may be able to replace an agent such as
azathioprine in a typical regimen, removing a
drug that must be taken orally every day and that
may cause adverse effects. however, the
possibility that some patients in the second
study 3 may have taken azathioprine at the
discretion of the investigator makes this difficult
to evaluate. the number of patients who
required treatment with azathioprine was not
reported, nor was the outcome in this population
described. although graft survival was not
significantly different from placebo in either trial,
rates were higher in the trial with a triple
immunosuppressive regimen.8 this issue should
be evaluated further.
pediatric use
the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd1798xxx  were investigated in children (age ≤
17 yrs) undergoing renal transplantation in an
open-label, multicenter study. 11 results were
available for 25 patients (median age 12 yrs).
patients received an immunosuppressive regimen
containing cyclosporine (90%), tacrolimus
(10%), or  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf; 95%).
 xxxd1798xxx  1 mg/kg was administered intravenously immediately before surgery and
biweekly for five doses. efficacy was evaluated
by graft survival and function as measured by
serum creatinine. at day 56, 24 grafts were
functioning with a mean serum creatinine level
of 0.8 mg/dl. one graft was lost and one patient
experienced mild, acute rejection that resolved
without treatment. in the first 3 months after
surgery, serious adverse effects were uncommon
(4 patients developed urinary tract infections, 1
patient each had bacteremia, gastroenteritis, and
fever), and there were no reports of cmv
infection, epstein-barr virus infection, or ptld.
however, this trial was uncontrolled, and it was
unclear if the adverse effects were due to
 xxxd1798xxx .
pharmacokinetic data were available from six
patients, and serum levels were lower than those
in adults treated with similar doses, but the levels
provided saturation of the il-2ra-subunit
immediately after the first dose and for more
than 1 month after the last dose. the authors

1131

proposed that children may be maintained with
lower  xxxd1798xxx  levels since pretransplantation
percentages of  xxxg1175xxx -positive t cells were also
lower than those in adults. they concluded that
the addition of  xxxd1798xxx  to current centerspecific immunosuppression may reduce acute
rejection in pediatric transplant recipients
without serious adverse effects or increased rates
of opportunistic infection. data in this study
suggest that the drug may be beneficial in this
high-risk group; however, due to the open-label,
uncontrolled design, small number of patients,
and extremely short follow-up, a conclusion
regarding its role in this population awaits
randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term trials.
in addition, the population may have been too
diverse in age to represent all children accurately.
calcineurin-sparing immunosuppressive protocols
 xxxd1798xxx  was evaluated in combination with
mmf and corticosteroids without cyclosporine or
tacrolimus in an uncontrolled cohort of 50
patients receiving primary human leukocyte
antigen (hla)-mismatched renal transplants.12
all patients received  xxxd1798xxx  2 mg/kg
intravenously as a first dose and 1 mg/kg
intravenous biweekly for four doses, steroids,
and mmf 1.5 g orally twice/day for the first 6
months after transplantation and then 1 g orally
twice/day. follow-up ranged from 38–214 days
(mean 77 days) in 32 cadaveric renal transplant
recipients, 11 living-related transplant recipients,
and 7 living, unrelated transplant recipients.
forty-two percent of patients experienced
acute rejection. calcineurin inhibitors were
started in 38 patients (76%), 8 (16%) required
 xxxd2676xxx , and 22 (44%) experienced delayed graft
function. no malignancy, graft loss, or death was
reported, but one patient had cmv viremia.
the percentage of circulating lymphocytes with
detectable il-2ra was evaluated in 23 patients.
levels decreased from 28 ± 7% before transplantation to 0% within 48 hours of the first
dose. at 4 months after transplantation, seven
patients had detectable il-2ra on only 2 ± 1% of
circulating lymphocytes. serum  xxxd1798xxx 
levels were within the expected range in six
patients with available data.12
although the concept of this trial was
interesting, the results do not support this
regimen due to the unacceptably high rejection
rate and the fact that most patients (76%)
eventually required calcineurin inhibitors. it also
should be noted that these patients received a

1132

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 10, 1999

higher initial dose of  xxxd1798xxx , but the
regimen still consisted of five doses. calcineurinsparing regimens are being investigated to reduce
the complexity of immunosuppressive therapy
and to avoid the potential for the long-term
adverse effects and drug interactions inherent
with cyclosporine and tacrolimus.
liver transplantation
an open-label, phase ii study was conducted in
28 liver allograft recipients to determine the
ability of  xxxd1798xxx  to reduce acute rejection.13
all patients received the entire course of
 xxxd1798xxx  1 mg/kg intravenously twice/day on
day 0 and 0.5 mg/kg on day 4 in conjunction
with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  xxxd1798xxx 
was well tolerated. one patient experienced acute
rejection on postoperative day 16. patient
survival at 3 months was 93% and no patients
developed cmv disease. the cd25+ cells were
undetectable for 32 ± 11 days with no decrease in
lymphocyte count.
the investigators evaluated patients treated
with two-drug immunosuppression and an
unconventional regimen of  xxxd1798xxx . followup was short, one patient experienced acute
rejection, and no control group was included.
these are preliminary results and should be
followed by a randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled study to establish the efficacy,
safety, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1798xxx  in
liver transplant recipients.
 xxxd286xxx 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and
administration
 xxxd286xxx  ( xxxd286xxx ; novartis pharma, east
hanover, nj) was approved by the fda in may
1998 for the prevention of kidney allograft
rejection in patients receiving concomitant
cyclosporine and steroids.  xxxd286xxx  is a
monoclonal antibody produced by chimerization
of a cd25-specific murine antibody with the
constant regions of human igg1 heavy chain and
k light chain. this chimerized monoclonal
antibody is obtained from a mouse myeloma cell
line that has been engineered to express plasmids
that contain the human heavy chain- and light
chain-constant regions and mouse heavy chainand light chain-variable regions. complete
binding to il-2ra occurs at serum levels greater
than 0.2 µg/ml, resulting in suppression of il-2
activity.

the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
 xxxd286xxx  were dose dependent in 32 recipients
of primary cadaveric renal allografts.14 after a
40-mg dose, maximum concentration (cmax) was
9.3 ± 4.5 µg/ml and after a 60-mg dose it was
11.6 ± 4.2 µg/ml. the area under the curve was
41 ± 17 µg•day/ml with the 40-mg dose and 72 ±
31 µg•day/ml with 60 mg. the terminal
elimination half-life was 6.5 ± 2.1 days, with
steady-state volume of distribution of 8.9 ± 2.5 l
and clearance of 46 ± 16 ml/hour.
pharmacokinetics also were investigated in 24
recipients of primary cadaveric liver allografts in
a randomized, single-center, open-label study.15
given the agent’s large volume of distribution in
renal allograft recipients, it was hypothesized that
serum concentrations may be affected by
excessive blood loss or drainage of ascitic fluid,
which would be relevant in these patients.
patients received a cumulative dose of
 xxxd286xxx  40 mg either as 20 mg/dose on days 0
and 4, or as 10 mg/dose on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 to
evaluate if more frequent dosing would reduce
drug loss by these means. the cmax increased
but did not double when a double dose was
administered (10 mg/dose, 2.14 ± 0.87 µg/ml; 20
mg/dose, 3.66 ± 0.90 µg/ml), terminal half life
was 4.1 ± 2.1 days, steady-state volume of
distribution was 7.5 ± 2.5 l, and clearance was
75 ± 24 ml/hour.  xxxd286xxx ’s total body
clearance was faster after several doses in liver
allograft recipients than after single doses in renal
allograft recipients. since the antibody is not
expected to be eliminated in the kidneys under
normal conditions, this clearance appears to be
nonrenal. drainage of ascitic fluid resulted in
only small amounts of drug loss relative to total
dose, but patients with substantial drainage may
require individual dosing. a moderate but not
statistically significant correlation was observed
between postoperative blood loss and drug
clearance, suggesting little contribution to drug
clearance.
the recommended dosage of  xxxd286xxx  for
renal allograft recipients is 20 mg intravenously
over 20–30 minutes for two doses, 2 hours before
transplantation and again on postoperative day 4.

performed in 21 centers in europe and canada
by the chib 201 international study group, was
designed to assess the drug’s ability to prevent
acute rejection in renal allograft recipients. 16
patients who had received a primary renal
transplantation from a cadaveric donor with at
least one hla class 1 or class 2 mismatch were
eligible for the intent-to-treat analysis. they
were excluded if they were recipients of one or
more organs or had a history of transplantation.
patients were randomized to receive either
 xxxd286xxx  20 mg by intravenous infusion over
30 minutes on day 0, 2 hours before transplantation and repeated on postoperative day 4,
or placebo. all patients received immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine microemulsion and steroids. whole blood trough

concentrations of cyclosporine were maintained
at 150–450 ng/ml during weeks 1 and 2, 150–300
ng/ml during weeks 3 and 4, and 100–300 ng/ml
for the rest of the study. steroid therapy consisted
of methylprednisolone 30–500 mg intravenously
on the day of surgery and oral prednisolone
0.3–1.0 mg/kg/day started on postoperative day
1. oral steroid dosages were tapered to 20
mg/day by day 21 and to 7.5 mg/day by day 90.
they remained in this range unless clinical
features required a change in the immunosuppressive regimen.
the primary outcome was frequency of at least
one episode of acute rejection confirmed by renal
biopsy and requiring treatment during the first 6
months postoperatively. severity of rejection was
assessed by banff criteria, and rejection was

1134

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 10, 1999

treated with steroid boluses as dictated by local
guidelines. in the case of steroid-resistant
rejection, other agents were given based on local
protocols. data on frequency of acute rejection
were followed for 12 months. secondary
measures were severity of rejection, frequency of
biopsy-confirmed and steroid-resistant rejection
within 6 months of transplantation, graft loss,
and safety and tolerability of the study drug over
12 months.
of 376 patients enrolled in the intent-to-treat
analysis, 333 were available for follow-up for all
12 months; 165 received  xxxd286xxx  and 168
received placebo. no clinically relevant
differences in demographics or other potentially
confounding variables were found between
groups. the primary measure of frequency of
rejection at 6 months was 32% lower in the
 xxxd286xxx  group than in the placebo group. no
statistically significant difference in severity of
rejection was seen between groups or in the
number of patients who experienced more than
one rejection episode; however, there was a
13.1% difference in the number of patients who
experienced steroid-resistant rejection, and at 12
months there was a statistically significant 16.9%
reduction in frequency of rejection in the
 xxxd286xxx  group compared with the placebo
group.
no differences in cyclosporine dosage or in
whole blood cyclosporine trough levels were
recorded between groups throughout the study.
at 2 and 4 weeks placebo-treated patients had
significantly higher dosages of steroids than
 xxxd286xxx -treated patients. no significant
differences were found in graft or patient survival
rates at 12-month follow-up.  xxxd286xxx  was
not associated with additional adverse effects
(data not provided), and no evidence of cytokine
release syndrome was reported. overall rates of
malignancy, ptld, and infection were similar
between groups.
a phase iii trial of  xxxd286xxx  was conducted
in 21 centers in the united states. 17 adult
recipients of primary cadaveric or living-related
renal transplants with one or more hla
mismatches were randomized to receive
immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine
microemulsion (whole blood trough concentrations maintained at 150–400 ng/ml through
week 4 and then at 150–300 ng/ml), steroids, and
either  xxxd286xxx  20 mg intravenously at day 0
and at day 4, or placebo (174 patients in both
groups). of 348 patients originally randomized
to a treatment group, 346 were available for

intent-to-treat analysis (173 in both groups).
the addition of  xxxd286xxx  resulted in a 33%
lower frequency of first rejection at 6 months and
a 28% reduction at 12 months. at 12 months,
 xxxd286xxx -treated patients had fewer second
rejections and fewer episodes requiring treatment
other than steroid augmentation. at that time no
significant difference was seen in patient or graft
survival between groups, nor did the frequency
or pattern of adverse events or rate of infections
differ. adverse effects that occurred in both
groups included infection and various thrombotic events. no cytokine release syndrome was
reported, and antiidiotype antibodies to the drug
were not detected.
of interest, graft loss at 12 months was
reduced among african-american patients
( xxxd286xxx  2%, placebo 12%, p=0.059). this
suggests possible ethnic or racial influences on
the agent’s activity, but this remains to be
determined in larger ethnic studies. this study is
also important because its primary end point was
frequency of acute rejection at 12 months, as
opposed to 6 months in the  xxxd1798xxx  studies,3, 8
investigators used an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay to determine serum levels
and kinetic properties in  xxxd286xxx -treated
patients and found that concentrations of 0.2
µg/ml or less were maintained for 36 ± 14 days
(range 12–91 days) in 164 patients. there was
no difference in duration of cd25 suppression
between patients who experienced an episode of
rejection and those who did not, 34 ± 14 and 37
± 14 days, respectively (p=0.2718). 20 the
elimination half-life in this population was 7.7 ±
3.3 days. rejection episodes occurred at an
average of 21 ± 15 days after transplantation, and
mean serum concentration of  xxxd286xxx  on day
of onset was 1.11 ± 1.09 µg/ml (range 0.2-–5.0
µg/ml). after the offset of receptor blockade, 54
episodes of rejection occurred in 34 patients
(average 78 ± 40 days), with no difference in
duration of receptor suppression compared with
those not experiencing rejection (p=0.1617).
these results do not suggest a relationship
between the drug’s serum concentrations and
protection from acute rejection. overall, this
may indicate that the benefit of  xxxg1174xxx 
suppression is determined early after transplantation and may not support additional doses
of  xxxd286xxx . the lack of difference in duration
of cd25 suppression also suggests that this may
not be an effective monitoring parameter for
protection from rejection.
a post hoc analysis of pooled data from all 42

 xxxg1175xxx  antagonists in solid organ transplantation berard et al
centers in both phase iii trials was conducted in
the subgroup of adults with diabetes mellitus
(dm) to determine the effect of the addition of
 xxxd286xxx .18 in the combined trials, 80 diabetic
patients and 283 nondiabetics received
 xxxd286xxx  and 70 and 289, respectively,
received placebo. the groups did not differ
demographically. in the 150 patients with dm,
the 12-month frequency of death, graft loss, or
first acute rejection, frequency of first acute
rejection, and first steroid-resistant rejection were
significantly reduced. graft survival at 12
months was also significantly reduced. it should
be noted that in this subgroup, the 6-month
acute rejection rate was much higher in the
placebo group (61%) compared with rates in
placebo groups of all patients in the phase iii
studies, 44%16 and 49.1%,17 respectively. this
analysis concluded that  xxxd286xxx  was superior
to placebo when given in conjunction with
cyclosporine and steroids in adults with dm after
renal transplantation.18
forty-one renal transplant patients were
treated with cyclosporine (target serum
concentration 150–200 ng/ml), low-dose
steroids, and either  xxxd286xxx  (21 patients) or
placebo (20 patients).19 the primary outcome
was the frequency of acute rejection during the
first 6 months. secondary objectives were safety,
tolerability, and patient and graft survival up to
12 months. no difference in groups were noted
at baseline. the frequency of biopsy-proved
rejection was decreased by approximately 50% in
patients treated with  xxxd286xxx . no patient
treated with  xxxd286xxx  experienced steroidresistant rejection. at 2 years, patient survival
was 100% in both groups, and no patient in
either group had ptld. the rate of cmv
infection was significantly lower in the
 xxxd286xxx  group. finally, patients treated with
placebo had an interesting trend toward a longer
hospital stay.
this study had a comparatively small number
of patients, and it was unclear if it was
randomized or blinded. at 6 months the
frequency of acute rejection was similar to that in
phase iii trials. however,  xxxd286xxx  reduced
the frequency of acute rejection by 48% in this
study and by only 32% 16 and 33% 17 in other
trials. this trial also reported a significant
difference in the rate of cmv infection compared
with no such difference in the other two trials.
no information was provided regarding
prophylactic therapy, but the decreased rate of
cmv infection is interesting because this study

1135

had a smaller sample and therefore smaller
power.  xxxd286xxx -treated patients also showed
a nonsignificant trend toward shorter hospital
stays. this could be an important benefit of the
agent and result in lower hospital-associated cost
and infection, reductions that must be confirmed
in larger trials.
discussion
 xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx  resulted in
30–40% reduction in acute rejection rates at 6
months in over 1200 renal allograft recipients.
their influence on chronic rejection must be
determined in studies with longer follow-up.
however, since a history of acute rejection is a
known risk factor for the development of chronic
rejection, 21 it is possible that a reduction in
chronic rejection may be gained. in addition,
with the exception of one trial of  xxxd1798xxx ,8 all
controlled trials were conducted with two-drug
regimens (cyclosporine and steroids). addition
of a second agent (azathioprine or mmf) does
not appear to be warranted from the data.
therefore,  xxxg1175xxx  antagonists may be
valuable in avoiding administration of some of
the more toxic and long-term immunosuppressive
agents.
the sparing of calcineurin agents was
investigated and reported in preliminary form12
with higher than acceptable rejection rates.
although this combination regimen did not
appear to be successful, other combinations with
il-2 antagonists as induction or front-line
therapy to spare other therapies such as mmf or
corticosteroids in the long term will continue to
be investigated.
although, to date, the agents have shown no
consistent improvement in patient or graft
survival rates, they appear to be devoid of
toxicities, which is important in transplantation
immunosuppression. induction therapy, in
general, has fallen out of favor in non-high-risk
patients due to risks of overimmunosuppression,
particularly cmv and ptld. so far, the drugs
have not increased the risk for these disorders;
and in one preliminary report, cmv infection
was decreased in the  xxxd286xxx  group. 19
certainly, longer-term data are necessary to
conclude definitively that the drugs are safe in
this respect.
currently, the agents are being given in some
centers for high-risk patients such as those
undergoing retransplantation, recipients with
high panel-reactive antibodies, african-

1136

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 10, 1999

americans, and children. preliminary data with
 xxxd1798xxx  in children11 and with  xxxd286xxx  in
african-americans 17 and diabetic patients 18
suggest that they will be useful in these
populations. whether the drugs have different
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in these
subgroups should be determined in larger,
comparative studies.
 xxxd1798xxx  is administered in five doses over
10 weeks, and  xxxd286xxx  is administered in a
somewhat simpler two-dose regimen over 4 days.
with these dosages, the estimated duration of
cd25 receptor suppression is 12 weeks for
daclizumab6 and 5 weeks for  xxxd286xxx .20 it is
unknown whether the duration of suppression
has a clinically relevant effect on graft or patient
outcomes. as shown with  xxxd286xxx , the
duration of suppression did not correlate with
acute rejection.20 due to the redundancy of the
immune system and the fact that the acute
rejection response involves a multitude of
cytokines and effector cells, blocking the il-2
pathway may not necessarily correlate directly
with the presence or absence of rejection. this is
likely the reason that these agents cannot be
given to treat ongoing rejection and the fact that
they do not dramatically alter acute rejection
rates. if the duration of cd25 suppression is not
important for the risk of rejection, perhaps
 xxxd1798xxx  can be administered in a similar
fashion as  xxxd286xxx  (2 vs 5 doses). the extra
doses of  xxxd1798xxx  usually require coordination
of outpatient visits and extra pharmacy and
nursing time to provide and administer the
doses. studies are under way to assess a twodose  xxxd1798xxx  regimen.
reimbursement may become an issue as payers
choose to cover one, both, or neither of these
expensive agents. for a 70-kg person, the cost of
a course of  xxxd1798xxx  at the recommended
dosing guidelines is approximately $6273, and
the cost of a course of  xxxd286xxx  is approximately $2448.22, 23 the difference is due mainly
to the additional doses required for  xxxd1798xxx .
it must be established whether the dosage of
 xxxd1798xxx  can be modified to bring the cost of
the agents closer while maintaining similar
efficacy.
an economic evaluation of  xxxd286xxx  was
conducted as part of a multicenter trial that
prospectively evaluated direct medical costs from
the perspective of the health care system. 24
information on the resource use of 346 patients
in the intent-to-treat study was collected for 12
months. direct medical costs included

hospitalizations, outpatient visits, medical
procedures, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and
drugs. median total first-year costs were $26,479
and $32,241 for  xxxd286xxx - and placebo-treated
patients, respectively (p=0.03); acquisition costs
of  xxxd286xxx  were not included. this was
thought to be due to reduced frequency of acute
rejection and reduced hospitalization for
rejection. the authors concluded that induction
with  xxxd286xxx  was beneficial both economically
and therapeutically during the first year after
transplantation. it must be kept in mind that
although interesting, this evaluation used costs
incurred during a clinical trial and thus may
reflect an increased level of monitoring and
medical interventions. it may not be representative of actual costs in general practice. also the
investigators did not include the acquisition cost
of  xxxd286xxx  in the comparison.
summary
 xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx  reduce the
frequency of acute rejection in renal allograft
recipients without an apparent increase in shortterm toxicities. however, the additional costs
incurred and lack of long-term outcomes in
chronic rejection, opportunistic infections, and
malignancies may temper enthusiasm for them.
to clarify these outstanding issues, large,
randomized trials have to be conducted with
substantial follow-up.
in the absence of these data, it is likely that the
agents will be administered to high-risk patients
in whom additional immunosuppression in the
early posttransplantation period is desirable. it is
also likely that they will be included in
combination immunosuppressive regimens to
avoid more toxic long-term immunosuppressive
agents after transplantation.
several questions regarding the il-2ra
antagonists are unanswered. the drugs clearly
prevented acute rejection in studies with shortterm follow-up, but will we find that they only
delay the onset of allograft rejection? also, the
transplantation community has to reach
consensus on monitoring the drugs. the current
attitude toward il-2ra antagonists is somewhat
cavalier due to their apparent lack of adverse
effects, but these agents do cause immunosuppression, which is likely to vary among
individuals. the clinical utility of the cd25
marker as a monitoring parameter is unclear, but
other strategies should be investigated to
quantify the relative state of immune function.

 xxxg1175xxx  antagonists in solid organ transplantation berard et al
finally, pharmacoeconomic analyses of the agents
must be conducted to determine if the incremental
benefit in acute rejection outweighs their
considerable expense.
the  xxxg1175xxx  antagonists are a significant
addition to available immunosuppressive
therapies. their expanded administration and
investigation will help determine their role in
transplant immunosuppressive protocols.
