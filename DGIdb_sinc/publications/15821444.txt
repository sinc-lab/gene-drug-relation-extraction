abstract: a common side effect of migraine treatment with triptans
is chest symptoms. the origin of these symptoms is not known. the
aim of the present study was to examine the vasocontractile effect of
triptans in human arteries and veins from the thoracic wall and in
coronary artery bypass grafts. in vitro pharmacology experiments
showed that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) type 1b and 1d receptor agonists,  xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and
 xxxd3562xxx , induced vasoconstriction in the thoracic blood vessels
from 38% to 57% of the patients. 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct)
and sumatriptan elicited a vasoconstriction that was antagonized by
the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb224289, whereas the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor antagonist brl115572 had no effect. 5-ht induced a
contraction that was inhibited by the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist
 xxxd2419xxx . 5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna levels were
detected by real-time pcr in all blood vessels studied. in conclusion,
triptans induce vasoconstriction in arteries and veins from the thoracic
wall, most likely by activation of 5-ht1b receptors. this response
could be observed in only 38% to 57% of the patients, which may
provide an explanation for why a similar number of patients experience
chest symptoms as a side effect of migraine treatment with triptans.

t is believed that migraine results from dilatation of
extracerebral cranial blood vessels and involves neurogenic
inflammation of trigeminal sensory neurons.1,2 several observations indicate that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5ht) is involved because platelet serotonin drops rapidly
during the onset of migraine, and serotonin infusion relieves
the attack.3,4 there are 14 distinct serotonin receptor subtypes,

grouped in 7 classes of receptors (5-ht1â€“7).5 5-ht2a, 5-ht1b,
and  xxxg1110xxx  are g-protein-coupled receptors that have been
shown to mediate vasoconstriction of human blood vessels.5,6
in peripheral blood vessels, the  xxxg1113xxx  subtype is
of major importance,6,7 whereas in the cranial vascular bed, the
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor subtypes have been shown to
mediate strong vasoconstriction.8
the improved understanding for the involvement of
serotonin in migraine has led to the development of selective
5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists, collectively known as triptans.9
the first  xxxd3263xxx , sumatriptan, became clinically available in
1991, followed by second-generation agents such as  xxxd1976xxx ,
naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , and  xxxd3562xxx , which all are highly
effective in the treatment of migraine.10,11 the mechanisms of
actions are vasoconstriction of meningeal vessels, decreased
neurogenic inflammation, and reduced central nociception.12,13
in clinical trials where triptans were used for the treatment of migraine, 1%â€“9% of the patients experienced chest
tightness, pressure, and pain.14â€“17 in a postmarketing study,
24% of the patients receiving oral sumatriptan and 41% of the
patients receiving the subcutaneous formulation experienced
chest symptoms.17 these side effects are of major concern
because the symptoms mimic angina pectoris and myocardial
infarction.18â€“21 the origin of the chest symptoms is uncertain,
although several explanations have been suggested, including
vasoconstriction of coronary and pulmonary arteries, esophageal spasm, intercostal muscle spasm, and bronchoconstriction.17,22â€“24 so far, no study has yet been performed to evaluate
the vasocontractile effect of triptans in small arteries and veins
from the human thoracic wall. in the present study, the effect of
 xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and  xxxd3562xxx  was analyzed. the vasocontractile response was also studied in the human saphenous vein and in the internal mammary
artery, which are commonly used coronary artery bypass
grafts. the left internal mammary artery and small thoracic
arteries and veins were obtained from the original site in the
thoracic wall during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. the
5-ht receptors were characterized by in vitro pharmacology,
and the 5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna expression levels were quantified by real-time pcr, which has
never been done before.

the laboratory, the vessels were dissected free from adhering
tissue, and the luminal side was gently rubbed with a metal
wire to disrupt the endothelium. blood vessels used for the
real-time pcr experiments were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at 280Â°c. the vessels for the in vitro pharmacology experiments were immersed in cold bicarbonate buffer
solution (for composition, see below).

the wall tension was measured at each length. separate vessel
segments were initially contracted by k+ before being
subjected to identical stretches, and the active tension (ta)
was recorded. a subtraction was made between the mean ta

the vessels were cut into cylindrical segments and
mounted on 2 l-shaped metal prongs, one of which was
connected to a forceâ€“displacement transducer for continuous
recording of the isometric tension. the mounted artery
segments were immersed in temperature-controlled (37Â°c)
tissue baths containing a bicarbonate-based buffer solution,
which was continuously gassed with 5% co2 in o2, resulting
in a ph of 7.4. eight to 16 ring segments were studied at the
same time in separate tissue baths. the internal mammary
artery and the saphenous vein segments were stabilized at a
resting tension of 4 mn, and the small thoracic arteries and
veins were stabilized at 2 mn for 1 hour before the
experiments were started (for lengthâ€“tension characteristics,
see below). the contractile capacity of each vessel segment
was examined by exposure to a k+-rich (63.5 mm) buffer
solution with the same composition as the bicarbonate
buffer solution, except that nacl was replaced by an equimolar concentration kcl. for method details, see wackenfors

endothelium. the 5-ht experiments were run in the absence
(control) and presence of the selective 5-ht2a antagonist
 xxxd2419xxx  (0.1 mm and 1 mm). the 5-ctexperiments were run
in the absence (control) and presence of the selective 5-ht1b
antagonist, sb224289 (0.1 mm), or the selective  xxxg1110xxx 
antagonist brl115572 (0.1 mm). all antagonists were added
30 minutes prior to the agonist. each blood vessel was divided
into multiple segments and each segment was used for one
agonist and antagonist only. in this way the receptors have not
been pre-occupied by a different agonist before the experiment
was started.

lengthâ€“tension measurements
the small thoracic arteries and veins from 2 patients
were removed, and each vessel was divided into 8 segments.
the segments were suspended in a bicarbonate-based buffer
solution and mounted for continuous recording of isometric
tension (see above). the vessels were allowed to stabilize for
1 hour, after which they were activated by a potassium-rich
(63.5 mm) buffer solution. following a short accommodation
period of 10 minutes, the distance between the metal prongs
was increased, each time by 0.25 mm, and the tension was
recorded as a function of internal diameter. the tension was
always allowed to reach a steady level in advance of the next
extension. the magnitude of the steady state tension was used
in the calculations. the optimal resting vessel wall tension in
the human internal mammary artery and saphenous vein has
been calculated using the same method before.25 in the study it
was determined that a resting tension of 4 mn can be used for
both the mammary artery and the saphenous vein to obtain an
optimal vascular response and was therefore used in the
present study.

real-time pcr
5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna expression levels were quantified by real-time pcr in the human
internal mammary artery, saphenous vein, and small arteries
and veins from the thoracic wall. trizolÃ²ls was used for the
rna extraction according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions
(life technologies, paisley, uk). reverse transcription of
total rna to cdna was performed with the geneamp rna
pcr kit in a dna thermal cycler (perkin-elmer, applied
biosystems, foster city, ca). first strand cdna was synthesized from 0.5â€“1 mg total rna in a 100-ml reaction
volume with random hexamers as primers. real-time pcr was
performed in a geneamp 5700 sequence detection system
using the geneamp sybrÃ² green kit (perkin-elmer, applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) with the cdna as template in
a 50-ml reaction. the geneamp 5700 sequence detection
system monitors the amplification of dna in real time using
an optic imaging system, via the binding of a fluorescent dye to
double-stranded dna. specific primers for the human 5-ht2a,
5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors were designed as follows:

 xxxd3263xxx -induced contraction in human blood vessels

the real-time pcr was performed with the following
profile: 50Â°c for 2 minutes, 95Â°c for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of
95Â°c for 15 seconds and 60Â°c for 1 minute. the genes for  xxxd3440xxx  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx )
were used as references because they are continuously
expressed in cells.

calculations and statistics
in vitro pharmacology
all calculations and statistics were performed using
graphpad 4.0 software. emax refers to the maximum contraction calculated as percentage of the contractile capacity of
63.5 mm k+. the negative logarithm of the drug concentration
that elicited 50% contraction (pec50) was determined by linear
regression analysis using the values immediately above and
below half-maximum response. the blood vessel segments for
the control experiment were obtained from the same patient as
the vessel segments for the antagonist experiment, which enabled a paired comparison. because not all antagonist experiments could be run on an artery from 1 patient, the control
curves for each agonist in the different figures varied slightly,
although not significantly. in the manuscript, â€˜â€˜nonrespondersâ€™â€™
refers to patients with blood vessel segments that did not
produce a concentration-dependent response that differed from
baseline. the curves are analyzed with the responding vessels
only. statistical significance was accepted when p , 0.05,
using student t test when comparing 2 groups and anova
(analysis of variance) when comparing more than 2 groups.
anova was carried out with bonferroni or dunnettÃµs correction test depending on the type of columns compared.
values are presented as means 6 sem.

real-time pcr
the amount of 5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
mrna was calculated as relative to the amount of  xxxg861xxx  or
b-actin mrna in the same sample by the formula: x0/r0 =
2ctr 2 ctx, where x0 = original amount of 5-ht receptor
mrna, r0 = original amount of  xxxg861xxx  or b-actin mrna,
ctr = ct -value for  xxxg861xxx  or b-actin, and ctx = ct -value
for the 5-ht receptor. statistical significance was accepted
when p , 0.05, using anova with bonferroni or dunnett
correction test, depending on the type of columns compared.
values are presented as means 6 sem relative to  xxxg861xxx 
mrna levels.

vessel segments are shown in figure 1. one group of vessel
segments was kept in k+-rich solution for induction of active
tension (ta), and the other was kept in ca2+-free buffer for
analysis of the passive tension (tp). a subtraction was made
between the mean values for the ta and tp (ta 2 tp) to
visualize the greatest reactivity of the vessels. for the small
thoracic arteries, the optimal resting force was 2.0 mn (fig.
1a). a range between 0.5 and 3.6 mn can be used depending
on the vessel size. for the small thoracic veins, the optimal
resting force was calculated to be 2.0 mn (fig. 1b). a range
between 0.7 and 3.4 mn can be used depending on vessel size.
therefore, in the present study a resting tension of 2.0 mn was
used for the small thoracic arteries and veins. it has previously
been demonstrated that the optimal resting tension for the
internal mammary artery and the saphenous vein is 4 mn.26
 xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and
 xxxd3562xxx  induced vasoconstriction in the human internal
mammary artery from 38% to 41% of the patients, in the small
thoracic arteries from 39% to 50% of the patients, in the small
thoracic veins from 40% to 57% of the patients, and in the
saphenous vein from 73% to 91% of the patients (for details,
see fig. 2 and table 1). in the blood vessels from the other
patients, the triptans did not induce a concentration-dependent
response that differed from baseline. subsequently, not all
patients had blood vessels that responded to triptans. the
vasocontractile response for  xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,
and  xxxd3562xxx  were similar in potency and efficacy (fig. 2
and table 1). the sumatriptan-induced contraction of the
mammary artery was antagonized by sb224289, whereas
brl115572 had no effect (fig. 3a and b), suggesting involvement of 5-ht1b receptors. the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist

 xxxd3263xxx -induced contraction in human blood vessels

striction of pulmonary arteries, esophageal spasm, intercostal
muscle spasm, and bronchoconstriction, are more likely causes
of the chest symptoms.17,22â€“24
in the present study, we show for the first time that
 xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and  xxxd3562xxx  elicit vasoconstriction of small arteries and veins from the
thoracic wall.  xxxd3263xxx -induced contraction could be observed
in blood vessels from 38% to 57% of the patients, whereas
blood vessels from 43% to 62% of the patients did not induce
a vasocontractile response that differed significantly from
baseline. this may provide an explanation for why a similar
number of patients experience chest symptoms as a side effect
when treated with triptans for migraine.17 in a previous study,
sumatriptan was shown to induce vasoconstriction in human
mesenteric arteries from some but not all patients.30 the fact
that not all vessels contracted to triptans may result from
variation among patients in the expression of 5-ht receptors

contraction was antagonized by the selective  xxxg1109xxx 
antagonist, sb224289 (0.1 mm, p , 0.05), whereas the  xxxg1110xxx  antagonist brl115572 (0.1 mm) had no effect (p = ns,
fig. 4 and table 2). 5-ht elicited vasoconstriction of the
internal mammary artery, saphenous vein, and small arteries
and veins from the thoracic wall (table 2). the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1 and 1 mm), inhibited the
5-ht response (p , 0.05, fig. 5 and table 2).
the 5-ct- and 5-ht-induced contractions were more
efficacious in the saphenous vein than in the mammary artery
both when the results were calculated as percentage of k+ and
in millinewtons (fig. 6 and table 3). no such difference could
be observed when the small thoracic arteries were compared
with the small thoracic veins.
5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna were
detected in the internal mammary artery, saphenous vein, and
small thoracic arteries and veins (fig. 7). there was no difference in the 5-ht2a and  xxxg1109xxx  mrna expression
levels among the blood vessels studied. the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
mrna expression was significantly higher in the small thoracic veins than in the saphenous vein (fig. 7).

discussion
triptans are 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists that induce
vasoconstriction of extracerebral, cranial blood vessels and are
effective in the treatment of migraine.1,2 chest tightness,
pressure, and pain are experienced by up to 24% of patients
receiving oral sumatriptan and 41% of patients receiving the
subcutaneous formulation.17 the mechanisms responsible for
these side effects have not been determined. it has been shown
that triptans induce vasoconstriction of human coronary arteries,5,24,26â€“28 although in the patients with chest symptoms,
no electrocardiographic or angiographic changes can be
shown.19,29 therefore, extracardiac events, such as vasoconq 2005 lippincott williams & wilkins

in the vascular smooth muscle cells. the reason for the
difference in response is not known and can not be deduced
from the present study but may be related to the patientsâ€™
different diseases, medication, gender, or other background
factors. it has been shown that treatment with sumatriptan
attenuates the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna and that  xxxd3562xxx 
reduces the 5-ht1b mrna in the rat basilar artery.31 furthermore, the 5-ht receptor expression has been shown to be
affected by age in rats.32 a study on arteries from hypersensitive rats has demonstrated an up-regulation of 5-ht2b
and 5-ht1b receptors.33
interestingly, the 5-ct- and 5-ht-induced contraction
was more efficacious in the saphenous vein than in the internal
mammary artery. furthermore, the expression of the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor mrna expression is higher in the small veins than in
the arteries from the thoracic wall. these results indicate that
the 5-ht receptors are especially important in the venous
vasculature and may play a role in stimulating the pain that is
experienced by patients treated with triptans for migraine.
the internal mammary artery and the saphenous vein are
commonly used as coronary artery bypass grafts, and the
response to triptans may be of importance once they are
grafted into the coronary circulation. sumatriptan has previously been shown to induce constriction of the human
internal mammary artery.34 in the human saphenous vein,
sumatriptan and  xxxd1976xxx  have been shown to elicit vasoconstriction.24,28 because an increasing number of triptans are
being used in the clinic, the present study was aimed to analyze
the effect of  xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan,
and  xxxd3562xxx . all of these proved to induce a strong vasoconstriction in the internal mammary artery and in the saphenous vein. interestingly, vasoconstriction was elicited in
the saphenous vein from 70% to 91% of the patients and in the
internal mammary artery from 38% to 41% of the patients.
special notice should therefore be taken before administering
triptans to patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
several 5-ht receptor subtypes are expressed in the
human vasculature, but only 5-ht2a, 5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  are
known to be involved in human vascular smooth muscle cell
contraction.5,6 in the blood vessels studied, 5-ht elicited a

strong vasoconstriction that was antagonized by the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1 and 1 mm). in the mammary artery, saphenous vein, and in the small thoracic veins,
10 mm  xxxd2419xxx  caused a rightward shift of the concentrationâ€“response curve.  xxxd2419xxx , 100 mm, did not further inhibit the contraction indication that maximum inhibition was
obtained with only 10 mm. the present results confirm that the
 xxxg1113xxx  is the most important vasocontractile receptor
in peripheral blood vessels.6,7 furthermore,  xxxg1113xxx 
mrna expression was detected by real-time pcr experiments
in the internal mammary artery, saphenous vein and small
arteries and veins from the thoracic wall. there was no difference in the amount of  xxxg1113xxx  mrna expression
levels between the blood vessels.
5-ct is a 5-ht1 receptor agonist that has been shown
before to elicit vasoconstriction in several human blood
vessels including cerebral, coronary, and pulmonary arteries.5,24,35,36 in the present study, the vasocontractile effect
of 5-ct was, for the first time, analyzed in small arteries and
veins from the thoracic wall. 5-ct induced vasoconstriction,
although to a lesser extent than 5-ht. the  xxxg1109xxx 
antagonist sb224289 inhibited the 5-ct response, and the
selective  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist brl115572, had no
effect. these results indicate that 5-ht1b receptors are of
major importance in mediating the 5-ct contraction in blood
vessels from the thoracic wall and in the saphenous vein.
furthermore, in the present study, real-time pcr experiments
showed the presence of  xxxg1109xxx  mrna. the
expression levels were similar in all blood vessels studied.
previous results from our group have shown a correlation between  xxxg1109xxx -induced contraction and the appearance of  xxxg1109xxx  protein on smooth muscle cells by
immunocytochemistry in human coronary and cerebral
arteries.5,35 interestingly,  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna was also
detected in the blood vessels included in the study, although no
contractile response could be observed. the functional results
in the present study are in accordance with previous studies
where no expression of  xxxg1110xxx  receptor protein on the smooth
muscle cells in human coronary and cerebral arteries could be
detected by immunocytochemistry.5,35 one explanation for this
discrepancy may be that mrna expression in smooth muscle
cells is not necessarily associated with translation into an
active receptor protein, localized to the cell surface. alternatively, the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna is expressed in other
parts of the vascular tissue, eg, in nerves surrounding the
vessel. previous studies have suggested that the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is involved in peripheral sensory transduction because
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna has been detected by pcr in human
lumbar dorsal root ganglion and by immunocytochemistry in
human trigeminal ganglia.37,38 sumatriptan has also been
shown to inhibit neurogenic inflammation in rat synovium,
which may be a response to activation of peripheral neuronal
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors.37,39
the present study shows a vasocontractile effect of
 xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and  xxxd3562xxx  in human blood vessel in the human thoracic wall as well as
in the saphenous vein. in the present study, the sumatriptaninduced vasoconstriction was antagonized by sb224289 but
unaffected by brl115572, suggesting involvement of 5-ht1b

receptors. this is in accordance with previous studies on
human coronary arteries showing that triptans induce vasoconstriction by activation of 5-ht1b receptors5,24 and on
human mammary arteries showing that 5-ht1-like receptors
mediate the contractile action of sumatriptan.40 the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1 mm) had no inhibitory
effect on the sumatriptan-induced contraction in the mammary
artery, indicating that 5-ht2a receptors were not involved.
similar results have been shown before in experiments with
human coronary arteries.26  xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,
and  xxxd3562xxx  elicited vasoconstrictions that were equally
potent and efficacious in the internal mammary artery,
saphenous vein, and small arteries and veins from the thoracic
wall. this is in accordance with previous findings from in vitro
pharmacological studies on human coronary arteries.28,41

conclusion
in the blood vessels from the thoracic wall and the
saphenous vein, the serotonin receptors were characterized by
in vitro pharmacology and real-time pcr. the 5-ht receptorinduced vasoconstriction was inhibited by  xxxd2419xxx , indicating  xxxg1113xxx  involvement. the contractions elicited
by the 5-ht1 receptor agonists, 5-ct and sumatriptan, were
antagonized by the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb224289, but
the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist brl115572 had no effect.
triptans, which are 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists, are therefore
most likely to induce vasoconstriction via the  xxxg1109xxx 
subtype.
a common side effect of migraine treatment with
triptans is chest symptoms. the mechanisms involved have not
yet been determined. in the present study, we show that
 xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and  xxxd3562xxx  induce vasoconstriction in arteries and veins from the
thoracic wall. this response could be observed in only 38%â€“
57% of the patients, which may provide an explanation for
why a similar number of patients (41%) experience chest
symptoms when treated with triptans for migraine.42 triptans
also induced vasoconstriction in the human saphenous vein
and in the internal mammary artery. these blood vessels are
commonly used as coronary artery bypass grafts, and it may
be of importance to consider the vascular effects of triptans
before treating patients who have undergone coronary artery
bypass graft surgery.
