abstract. the discriminative stimulus effects of direct

and indirect-acting gabaergic drugs were investigated
in rats trained to discriminate 5 mg/kg pentobarbital
(pb) from saline under a two-lever fixed ratio (fr) 32
schedule of food reinforcement. pb and diazepam
produced dose-dependent substitution for the training
dose of pb with response rate reduction only at doses
above those producing full substitution. muscimol,
thiomuscimol and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-@
pyridin-3-ol (thip) produced intermediate levels of pentobarbital-lever responding (40-60%), accompanied by
dose-dependent decreases in rates of responding following thip and muscimol administration. the gabaa
agonist  xxxd3022xxx  and its metabolite 4-{[(4-chlorophenyl) (5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]amino}]
butyric acid (sl 75102) also partially substituted for pb,
producing means of 39-73% pb-lever responding. the
gabab agonist, baclofen, completely failed to substitute
for pb even at doses that decreased rates of responding.
these results show that the discriminative stimulus effects of indirect gabaa agonists, pb and diazepam,
although similar to one another, differ from those of
direct gabaa receptor agonists, which produced only
partial substitution for pb. the gabab agonist,
baclofen, can be distinguished by lacking any ability to
substitute for pb. these results contribute to a further
understanding of the similarities and differences in the
behavioral effects of different types of gaba agonists.

thought to act by enhancement of gabaergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system (sanger 1988;
young 1991). most studies have focused on examining
the indirect gabaa agonists such as the barbiturates
and benzodiazepines. these indirect agonists allosterically modify gaba-mediated chloride flux without direct
actions at the neurotransmitter site (twyman et al. 1989).
the results of these studies provide a complex profile of
both similarities and differences among the discriminative stimulus effects of the barbiturates and benzodiazepines, dependent on the conditions of training and
testing. however, under many circumstances substitution studies reveal complete cross generalization
within and among the barbiturate and benzodiazepine
drug classes in a number of species (colpaert et al. 1976;
herling et al. 1980; winger and herling 1982; de vry and
slangen 1986). these cross generalization data support
the hypothesis that gabaergic activation serves as the
neural basis of the discriminative stimulus effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines. in addition, evidence for
similarities in the discriminative stimulus effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines in animals is consistent
with evidence for similarities in the discriminative and
subjective effects of these drugs in humans (griffiths et
al. 1985; de wit and griffiths 1991; johanson 1991).
little is known about the discriminative stimulus effects of gaba agonists which act directly at the neurotransmitter site. there have been some studies of direct
gabaa agonists in animals trained to discriminate
various benzodiazepines from vehicle. substitution tests
with the direct gabaa agonists nmscimol or thip have
been conducted in diazepam-trained (haug 1983; nielsen et al. 1983), lorazepam-trained (ator and griffiths
1986) and midazolam-trained (rauch and stolerman
1987) rats and midazolam-trained squirrel monkeys
(spealman 1985). in these studies the gaba a agonists
did not fully substitute for the benzodiazepine discriminative stimulus, producing no greater than 45% druglever responding. in addition,  xxxd3022xxx , a gaba prodrug, and its primary metabolite, sl 75102, failed to
substitute for chlordiazepoxide in rodents (sanger 1988).

materials and methods

subjects. fourteen male sprague-dawley rats were obtained from
charles river farms, wilmington, ma. subjects weighed approximately 31 0-390 g and were maintained at these weights for the
duration of the study. the animals were individually housed in wire
mesh cages with water available ad libitum. the animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. all training and testing
procedures occurred during the light phase. upon completion of
training and testing sessions, the rats were fed approximately
10-15 g (purina rodent chow) and returned to their home cages.
two of the fourteen rats had been previously tested with competitive and noncompetitive nmda antagonists (willetts and balster 1989); the remaining 12 were naive at the start of this study.

apparatus. six two-lever, sound- and light-attenuated operant
chambers were used in this study (coulbourn instruments, leigh
valley, pa). each chamber was illuminated during sessions by a
white house light. lever pressing was reinforced with 45-mg food
pellets (dustless precision pellets, bioserv, frenchtown, n j)
delivered to a food trough located between the left and right response levers.
training procedure. rats were shaped to lever press for food reinforcement during daily (monday-friday) training sessions of
30 rain duration. initially, each response on either lever was reinforced. after responding reliably occurred on both levers, discrimination training began. one lever was designated the pb lever, the
other the saline lever. on days when 5 mg/kg pb was administered,
only responding on the pb lever was reinforced. on days when saline was administered, only responding on the saline lever was reinforced. the response requirement was incremented gradually and
independently for each lever to a fixed ratio value of 32 (fr-32).
responses on the incorrect lever reset the ratio value on the correct
lever. the rats received pb or saline injections ip according to a
double alternation schedule (i.e. sal, sal, pb, pb, sal, etc.).
following all injections, the rats were returned to their home cages
and 15 rain later were placed in the operant chambers.
acquisition testing. testing the acquisition of the pb/saline discrimination was completed using a series of four test probes. after stable
responding under the fr-32 schedule on both the pb and saline
lever had been established, 2-min test probes were conducted on
tuesdays and fridays. during test probes, responding on either the
pb or saline lever was reinforced. following these probes, responding on only the correct lever was reinforced for the remaining 28 rain
of the session. successful completion of the acquisition tests by the
animals required: completion of the first fr on the appropriate

lever, greater than 85% correct lever responding and response rates
greater than 1.0 response per second. each subject was required to
successfully complete four consecutive probe tests, two saline and
two pb, before substitution testing began.

substitution testing. test sessions were 30 min in length and occurred on tuesday and fridays if the animal had met the afore
mentioned criteria on the preceding training day. during the 30-min
test sessions, responding on either lever was reinforced under the
fr-32 schedule; responding on one lever reset the fr requirement
on the opposite lever. the fouowing drugs were evaluated in the order
listed: sodium pentobarbital (0.3-17.3 mg/kg), baclofen (1.25-20
mg/kg), sl 75102 (1-200 mg/kg),  xxxd3022xxx  (30-560 mg/kg), muscimol (0.3-3 mg/kg), thip (1-30 mg/kg), thiomuscimol (0.1-3
mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3-5 mg/kg). prior to the evaluation of each
dose-effect curve, control test sessions with 5 mg/kg pb and saline
were conducted. pb, muscimol, and thiomuscimol were administered 15 min prior to the start of the test session. baclofen was given
20 min prior to the test session.  xxxd3022xxx , sl 75102, thip, and
diazepam were administered 30 min prior to testing. all drugs were
given ip in a volume of 1.0 ml/kg except for higher doses of
 xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102 which required volume adjustment. not
all subjects were tested with each drug due to the length of the study
and animal mortality.
drugs. sodium pentobarbital (harvey laboratories, philadelphia,
pa), ( _+) baclofen (ciba geigy, summit, n j), muscimol hydrobromide, thiomuscimol hydrobromide and thip hydrochloride
(research biochemicals inc, natick, ma) were dissolved in saline.
 xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102 (synthelabo, bagneux, fr) were suspended in a distilled water- 1% tween 80 vehicle. diazepam (elgin-sinn,
cherry hill, n j) was administered in a  xxxd3034xxx /ethanol/
benzyl alcohol/water vehicle. doses refer to the drug forms listed
above. the compounds were generally dissolved on either the day
before or the day of substitution testing.

analysis of data. for each 30-min test session, response rate and
percentage of pb-lever responding were calculated. when the response rate was less than 0.05 responses per second, the lever
selection data for that subject for that dose was not included in the
group analysis. group data for the subjects was presented as the
mean and standard error of the mean (sem). edso values (with
95% confidence limits) are the doses estimated to produce a 50%
decrease in response rate compared to the response rate during the
saline control test conducted before the dose-effect curve as determined by linear regression of the linear portion of the group doseeffect curve after loglo transformation of dose.

with complete suppression at the highest dose tested
(3 mg/kg muscimol and 30 mg/kg thip).
response rate decreasing effects of thiomuscimol were
not obtained at the doses tested. higher doses o f thiomuscimol were not examined due to limited drug supply. the edsos for response rate decreasing effects
were 1.2 mg/kg (95% c i = 0 . 6 - 2 . 3 ) for muscimol and
7.0 mg/kg (95% ci=4.3-11.3) for thip.
results of stimulus generalization testing with the
gabaa agonist  xxxd3022xxx  and its primary metabolite,
sl 75102, are shown in fig. 4.  xxxd3022xxx , at doses of
30-560 mg/kg, resulted in dose-dependent partial substitution for pb, with a maximum of 39% pb-lever responding at 560 mg/kg. doses of 30 and 56 mg/kg engendered primarily saline-lever responding with no significant decrease in response rates. full substitution (i.e.

dose-effect curves for muscimol, t h i p and thiomuscitool are shown in fig. 3. all three o f these drugs
produced intermediate levels of pb-lever responding
(40-60%); however, there was no systematic dose-effect
relationship except for thip. for both muscimol and
thiomuscimol, the highest doses tested were associated
with the lowest level of pb-lever selection. this partial
substitution for pb as reflected in the group means represents some animals responding almost exclusively
( > 85 %) on the pb lever and others almost exclusively on
the saline lever. there was not a pattern to the individual
subject differences (i.e. substitution did not occur in a
subset of the animals). dose-dependent decreases in rates
of responding were produced by muscimol and t h i p ,

> 85 % pb-lever responding) occurred at doses of 100 and
173 mg/kg  xxxd3022xxx  in only one animal and at
300 mg/kg in two rats. at the 560 mg/kg dose, two rats
responded primarily on the pb-lever, but rate-decreasing
effects were seen in all animals at this dose. the edso for
 xxxd3022xxx 's response rate decreasing effects was greater
than the highest dose tested (560 mg/kg).
sl 75102 also partially substituted for pb. at doses
of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg, sl 75102 substituted fully in one
animal, but this occurred in a different subject at each
dose. at 100 mg/kg, sl 75102 produced full substitution
in two of six subjects. complete substitution occurred in
only one subject at both the 50 and 100 mg/kg doses. at
200 mg/kg, a maximum of 73% pb-lever responding
occurred, but this dose also substantially decreased rates
of responding. taken together, five of six subjects fully
substituted (> 85 % pb-lever responding) for pb at doses
greater than 100 mg/kg sl 75102. an edso value of
164 mg/kg (95% ci= 80.2-336.8) was obtained for the
response rate decreasing effects of sl 75102.
discussion

the discriminative stimulus properties of the indirectacting gaba agonists pb and diazepam, although similar to each other, differ from those of direct gabaa and
gabab agonists. in rats trained to discriminate pb from
saline, diazepam fully substituted for pb; the direct
gabaa agonists, muscimol, thip, thiomuscimol,
 xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102, produced intermediate levels of
pb-lever responding; and the direct gabab agonist,
baclofen, completely failed to substitute for pb.
these results are generally consistent with previous
reports showing similarities in the discriminative stimulus effects of pb and diazepam (overton 1966; j/irbe
1976; herling et al. 1980; winger and herling 1982;
balster and moser 1987) and between barbiturates and
benzodiazepines in general (colpaert et al. 1976; spealman 1985; de vry and slangen 1986), although exceptions to this general finding have been reported (ator and
griffiths 1983, 1989). it can be suggested that enhancement of gabaergic neurotransmission is the basis of
barbiturate discrimination, and the overlap in the discriminative stimulus effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines is among the strongest evidence for a
gabaergic basis of barbiturate discrimination (colpaert et al. 1976; herling et al. 1980; winger and herling
1982). on the other hand, it is clear that the benzodiazepine receptor site itself is not involved in barbiturate discrimination (herling and shannon 1982;
garcha et al. 1985; stolerman et al. 1986).
cross-generalization between pb and direct gaba
agonists would have provided additional support for an
hypothesis of gaba receptor activation mediating the
pb discriminative stimulus, but this was not obtained in
the present study. the partial generalization from pb to
direct gabaa agonists, but not to the gabab agonist
baclofen, can be viewed as suggesting that the gabaa
receptor complex might be involved in mediating pb
discriminative stimulus effects: however, it should be

noted that similar or greater levels of pb-lever responding can also be produced by selective n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists (willetts and balster 1989).
baclofen is the prototypical  xxxg828xxx  agonist
(bowery 1982) and fails to bind to the gabaa receptor
complex (hill and bowery 1981) except at non-pharmacological concentrations (olsen et al. 1978). the behavioral effects of baclofen differed from those of pb and the
direct gabaa agonists. generalization from pb to baclofen failed to occur, occasioning no greater than 16 %
pb-lever responding. in previous studies, baclofen failed
to substitute for either chlordiazepoxide in rats (colpaert
et al. 1976) or pb in pigeons (herling et al. 1980). in
contrast, baclofen produced dose-dependent generalization from diazepam in diazepam-trained rats (bennett
and amrick 1986).
an important finding of this study is that drug discrimination procedures can be used to distinguish between the behavioral effects of classes of gabaergic
drugs acting at different sites on the gaba, receptor
complex. the lack of complete cross-generalization from
pb to the direct gaba, agonists muscimol, thip,
thiomuscimol,  xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102 is consistent with
previous studies reporting that muscimol did not fully
substitute for pb in pigeons (herling et al. 1980) and that
thip did not substitute for pb in rats (ator and griffiths
1986). in addition, ator (1991) has reported that rats
could be trained to discriminate thip from vehicle injections, and pb did not substitute for thip in these animals. the results are also generally consistent with
previous studies showing a lack of substitution by muscimol and/or thip in animals trained on a benzodiazepine
discrimination (haug 1983; nielsen et al. 1983; spealman 1985; ator and griffiths 1986; rauch and stolerman 1987). interestingly, thip enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of diazepam in rats (nielsen et al.
1983).  xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102 failed to substitute for
chlordiazepoxide in chlordiazepoxide-trained rats (sanget 1988).
the evidence for differences in the discriminative stimulus effects of direct and indirect gaba agonists is also
consistent with data showing differences in the profile of
other behavioral effects of these drug classes (see sanger
1985 for review). these gaba agonists have been compared for effects on learned behavior, seizure activity,
food and water intake, nociception, stereotypy and
myorelaxation. one possibility to consider in assessing
the relevance of data showing lack of complete
generalization from pb to direct gabaa agonists is that
muscimol, thip, thiomuscimol,  xxxd3022xxx  and sl
75102 may not have in vivo effects entirely mediated by
gabaa receptor activation. the best evidence for a
gabaergic basis for the pharmacological effects of this
class of drugs comes from studies showing their ability
to antagonize convulsant actions of bicuculline and
 xxxd2947xxx  and the antagonism of their in vivo effects by
these gabaa antagonists (worms et al. 1979, 1982;
lloyd et al. 1982; gray et al. 1984). on the other hand,
such agonist-antagonist relationships with bicuculline
and  xxxd2947xxx  are not always found for the direct
