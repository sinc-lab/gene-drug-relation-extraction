characterization of  xxxd2056xxx  reduction
of iowthreshold calcium current in
thalamic neurons
douglas a. coulter, phd, john r. huguenard, phd, and david a. prince, md
the mechanism by which  xxxd2056xxx  reduces thalamic low-threshold calcium current (ltcc) was analyzed using
voltage-clamp techniques in acutely isolated ventrobasal complex neurons from rats and guinea pigs. the  xxxd2056xxx -induced reduction of ltcc was voltage dependent: it was most pronounced at more-hyperpolarized potentials
and did not affect the time course of activation or inactivation of the current.  xxxd2056xxx  reduced ltcc without
altering the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or the time course of recovery from inactivation. dimethadione reduced ltcc by a similar mechanism, while  xxxd3485xxx  had no effect on ltcc. we conclude that
 xxxd2056xxx  reduction of ltcc in thalamic neurons is consistent with a reduction in the number of available ltcc
channels or in the single ltcc channel conductance, perhaps indicating a direct channel-blocking action of this drug.
given the importance of ltcc in thalamic oscillatory behavior, a reduction in this current by  xxxd2056xxx  would be
a mechanism of action compatible with the known anticonvulsant effects of this drug in typical absence seizures.

 xxxd2056xxx  is an anticonvulsant frequently used in
the treatment of typical generalized absence (petit mal)
epilepsy {i, 2). in fact, its anticonvulsant action is
specific for this type of epilepsy; it is ineffective in the
treatment of other types of generalized seizures and
against all types of partial seizures el, 2). however,
few cellular actions of  xxxd2056xxx  have been described that are consistent with its specific anticonvulsant effects (reviewed in 131). characterization of the
cellular mechanism of action of  xxxd2056xxx  could
have direct bearing on our understanding of the pathogenesis of petit mal epilepsy, and could also aid in the
development of other anticonvulsant drugs.
evidence from depth recordings in petit mal patients
141, and extracellular recordings in animal models of
petit mal {5-71, indicates that the 3-hz spike-wave
rhythms in the electroencephalogram, characteristic of
absence seizures, are generated by rhythmic reverberating interactions between mutually interconnected
thalamic and cortical areas. in different experimental
models of petit mal the thalamus may either lead or
follow the cortex in the genesis of these spike-wave
rhythms. in rat genetic models of petit mal the discharge in the thalamus may lead that in the cortex {7),
whereas in feline generalized penicillin epilepsy the
reverse is true 15, 6). however, what is clear in all of
these models, and in recordings from petit mal patients

{4),is that the thalamus plays an important role in the
generation of 3-hz spike-wave rhythms characteristic
of petit mal epilepsy.
most studies of the cellular actions of  xxxd2056xxx 
have employed cultured cortical mammalian 18) and
spinal neurons (81; in some cases neurons from invertebrate species have been used 19). no cellular
mechanisms consistent with the anticonvulsant action
of  xxxd2056xxx  have been demonstrated in these
types of cells when the drug is applied in concentration
ranges appropriate for its clinical action [2, 3). we
chose to examine  xxxd2056xxx  actions on thalamic
neurons because of the important role of the thalamus
in generation of petit mal epilepsy. neurons in virtually all areas of the thalamus are characterized physiologically by the presence of a large-amplitude, lowthreshold calcium spike { 10- 14). this conductance
underlies bursts of:action potentials generated in thala m i ~neurons and plays an important role in thalamic
oscillatory behavior (e.g., in the generation of thalamic
sleep spindles, as reviewed in {14)).
we have previously shown that the petit mal anticonvulsant  xxxd2056xxx  reduces the low-threshold
calcium current (ltcc) underlying the low-threshold
calcium spike in rodent thalamic neurons in vitro {ls].
in the present study, we further examined this action
of  xxxd2056xxx  and also tested the effects of another

specific petit mal anticonvulsant, dimethadione, on calcium currents in thalamic neurons. our goal was to
investigate the mechanism by which these anticonvulsants reduce the ltcc.

methods
dissociation
all experiments were performed on thalamic neurons
acutely isolated from the ventrobasal complex of rats and
guinea pigs (ages 1 day-adult) using the methods described
by kay and wong 1163. animals were anaesthetized with
pentobarbital and decapitated. a portion of the brain containing the thalamus was removed, trimmed, and glued to the
stage of a vibratome (lancer) for slicing. thalamic slices (600
pm thick) were then cut and placed in an oxygenated pipes
(piperazine-n, n‘-bis[2 ethanesulphonic acidlbbuffered solution containing trypsin (0.8 mg/mi, sigma, st louis, mo)
for 45 minutes to 1 hour. the pipes solution contained the
:
120; kci, 5; caci2, 1; mgc12, 1;
following (in m ~ )nacl,
d-glucose, 25; pipes 20 (ph 7.0). slices were then removed
from the enzyme solution, rinsed, cut into chunks, and triturated using fire-polished pasteur pipettes. cells were plated
onto culture dishes and stored in an oxygenated incubator
for 0.5 to 12 hours prior to use.

recording
patch recordings of calcium currents were made using the
whole-cell voltage-clamp method described by hamill and
colleagues 117 ) . the intracellular solution used to isolate
calcium currents was a variation of one previously described
118) and consisted of the following (in mm):  xxxd3449xxx  phosphate (dibasic), 110;  xxxd3449xxx , 28; ethylene glycol bis-(p
amhoethylether)-n, n , n‘, ”-tetraacetic acid, 11; mgc12,
2; cac12, 0.5; na- xxxd83xxx , 4; p h 7.35. the
external solution was composed of the following (in mm):
 xxxg2020xxx , 155; kci, 3; mgc12, 1; cac12, 3; hepes-na+, 10;
tetrodotoxin, 0.0005; p h 7.4. all recordings were conducted at room temperature (20-22°c). a 8-mv liquid
junction potential was measurable between the electrode and
bath solutions, so all voltage command levels were compensated accordingly. patch electrodes were pulled on a list li
m-3p-a puller (darmstadt, frg)using a two-stage pull, and
had resistances of 6 to 8 m a . currents were monitored
either with a list l/m-epc-7 or with an axopatch 1a (axon
instruments, burlingame, ca) and filtered at 5 k h z with an
%pole bessei filter prior to digitization. all data were stored
and analyzed using a dec pdp-11/73 computer with a cheshire data interface (indec, sunnyvale, ca). a backup copy
of most data was recorded on videotape using a pulse-code
modulated interface (neurocorder, neurodata instruments,
new york, ny). leak and capacitance currents are subtracted from active currents in all figures.

series resistance errors and escape
compensation circuitry was used whenever possible to minimize potential series resistance errors. this circuitry could
compensate 90% of the series resistance. typical series resistance (&) errors with a 10 ms1 r, (compensated to 1 m a )
and a 500 pa current would be 0.5 mv. when drugs were
applied using bath perfusion with high flow rates (for ex-

ample, in obtaining  xxxd2056xxx  dose-response data), fluctuations in solution level often induced oscillations due to
the r, compensation circuitry. for this reason, r, compensation was not used in these instances, and the potential r,
error therefore increased to 5 mv. voltages during command potentials eliciting calcium currents were judged to be
well controlled based on smooth voltage-dependent activation and activation and inactivation kinetics, which were independent of current magnitude (for example, see current
traces in steady-state inactivation data).

drag concentrations and method of application
all anticonvulsantswere applied in concentration ranges that
were clinically relevant (i.e., in concentrations that are
achieved as free serum levels in epileptic patients medicated
with a particular anticonvulsant). for  xxxd2056xxx  and dimethadione this concentration range was 280 to 700 +m
(40-100 pg/ml) 11, 2) and 5 to 9 mm (700-1,200 pg/ml)
119, 203, respectively. drugs were applied either by changing the extracellular bathing medium or by perfusion onto
the cell produced by applying pressure to the back of drugcontaining broken micropipettes (tip diameter 2-4 bm).

results
results presented in this paper are summarized from
recordings of drug effects in 143 cells: 80 from rat, and
63 from guinea pig, ventrobasal complex neurons. results from the two species were indistinguishable and
so were pooled for subsequent data analysis.

thakamic calciam cawents
it was possible to identify at least two, and possibly
three, distinct calcium currents in whole-cell voltageclamp recordings from thalamic neurons on the basis
of activation and inactivation kinetics, voltage thresholds, and pharmacological sensitivity [21}. figure 1 illustrates the properties of the two largest, most easily
distinguishable calcium currents, whch were the focus
of our studies of anticonvulsant pharmacological action. at holding potentials of - 100 mv, depolarizing
voltage commands to -60 mv or more positive potentials elicited a transient calcium current that inactivated rapidly during the time course of the 200-msec
voltage command (see fig la, left traces). this current
was similar to the “ t [22}, type i (231, or 1.v.a. [24}
calcium current described by others, and will henceforth be called the low-threshold calcium current. the
ltcc became larger with increasing voltage commands and peaked in isolation during voltage commands to -40 mv (see fig la, left traces and fig lb,
iv plot). during voltage commands to -30 mv or
more positive potentials, a sustained noninactivating or
slowly inactivating calcium current began to appear
that peaked at 0 mv (see fig lb, right traces and iv
plot). this current was similar to the “l” 1221, type 11
{23}, or h.v.a. [24} calcium current described by

others, and will be referred to as the high-threshold
calcium current (htcc). steps to potentials more depolarizing than 0 mv resulted in a gradual decrease in
the size of the htcc, as the voltage command approached the reversal potential for the calcium current
(see fig 1, iv plot). at holding potentials of - 30 mv
the ltcc was inactivated, and the htcc could be
evoked in isolation by depolarizing steps (not shown).
the effects of anticonvulsants on these two components of whole-cell calcium current could thus be examined by eliciting responses from a holding potential
of - 100 mv to step commands of -40 mv (to illustrate effects on the ltcc in isolation), and to 0 mv
(where the htcc is maximal). both of these currents
were blocked by perfusion of 500 p~ cd2+ (not
shown).

a maximal dfictestimate of40%. this equation assumes a oneto-one stoichiometry between es concentration and e f f t on calcium current.

 xxxd2056xxx  reductions of calcium currents
applications of  xxxd2056xxx  in concentrations of 50
to 1,000 p~ reversibly reduced the ltcc and in some
cases the htcc (fig 2a) in 77 of 101 neurons, as we
have previously described cl5l. a portion of the population (23%) was unresponsive to  xxxd2056xxx . no
differences in calcium current properties between
 xxxd2056xxx -unresponsive and  xxxd2056xxx -responsive neurons were detected.  xxxd2056xxx  reduction
of ltcc was maximal at concentrations of 500 pm.
for 10  xxxd2056xxx -responsive cells, application of
500 p~  xxxd2056xxx  resulted in a reduction of ltcc

(assessed by voltage commands to -40 mv from a
holding potential of - 100 mv) of 31.9 +- 4% (mean
+- se). for the same cells,  xxxd2056xxx  reduced the
htcc (assessed by voltage commands to 0 mv from a
holding potential of - 100 mv) by 2.8 k 7.5% (cf.,
upper and lower traces of fig 2a).  xxxd2056xxx  reduction of ltcc was dose dependent and could be fit
by a curve generated by an equation that assumed oneto-one stoichiometry, a maximal reduction of ltcc of
40010, and an ec50of 200 fm (curve in fig 2b).
 xxxd2056xxx  reduced calcium currents over the full
range of activation potentials (fig 3), although the percentage reduction was largest at more hyperpolarized
step commands and decreased with more depolarized
step commands. this effect is illustrated in figure 4a,
where percentage reduction in calcium currents by
 xxxd2056xxx  is plotted versus step command potential
for the  xxxd2056xxx  application illustrated in figure 3.
this plot clearly shows that the  xxxd2056xxx  effect on
the ltcc is voltage dependent. this voltage dependence may explain some of the specificity of ethosuxh i d e action on the ltcc as compared with the
htcc: the ltcc is evoked by more hyperpolarized
step commands than the htcc, and therefore would
be more affected by  xxxd2056xxx . in figure 4b, the
amplitude of the  xxxd2056xxx -blocked current is plotted versus the voltage eliciting the current for the cell
shown in figures 3 and 4a.  xxxd2056xxx  reduction of
calcium currents occurred only in potential ranges
overlapping the activation range of the ltcc (cf., figs
1, 3c).

mechanism of etbomximide block of calcium currents
the  xxxd2056xxx -induced reductions in ltcc might
be produced by a change in the activation or inactivation kinetics or voltage dependence of the current, a
decrease of the number of ava'lable ltcc channels, or
a decrease in the single channel conductance. we performed experiments to test some of these possibilities.
records of control and  xxxd2056xxx -reduced ltcc
traces were normalized so that the peak amplitudes of
both traces were the same. the time course of acti586 annals of neurology vol 25

vation and inactivation of the ltcc could then be
directly compared under control and ethosuximideexposed conditions. if  xxxd2056xxx  reduced ltcc by
slowing activation or speeding inactivation kinetics, a
change in the time course of the current would be
expected. the time course of the ltcc was identical
in normalized current traces from control and drugtreated neurons (fig 5), suggesting that  xxxd2056xxx 
reduces the ltcc without affecting the kinetics of
activation or inactivation.
a second mechanism by which  xxxd2056xxx  could
reduce the ltcc might be to shift the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of this conductance
to more hyperpolarized levels. this would reduce the
number of available ltcc channels that could be activated by a given depolarizing command and consequently reduce the amplitude of the total ltcc. figure 6 shows a comparison of steady-state inactivation
curves under control and  xxxd2056xxx  (350 p ~ ) exposed conditions (in a neuron where the drug reduced the ltcc by 46%). when the available fraction
of ltcc was plotted against the holding potential, no
shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was found (see fig 6b).
another possibility is that  xxxd2056xxx  reduces
ltcc by prolonging the time course of recovery from

demethylated to dimethadione, the active metabolite,
which is only poorly metabolized and accumulates in
high concentrations (therapeutic free serum levels are
5-9 m ~ c19,
) 203. when applied to acutely isolated
thalamic neurons in concentrations of 4 or 8 m ~ di-,
methadione reversibly reduced both the ltcc and
htcc (ltcc reduction 52.4 ? 3.676, htcc reduction 34 ? 5.876, concentration 8 m ~n ,= 10; ltcc
reduction 40.0 -+ 5.576, htcc reduction 31.2
+- 4.596, concentration 4 mm, n = 5 ) (fig 8). like
 xxxd2056xxx , dimethadione caused a reduction of
ltcc over the full range of activation voltages (see
fig 8a,b). dimethadione-reduced calcium currents
showed no changes in their time course of activation or
inactivation when compared with control currents (see
fig 8a). the reductions of ltcc showed similar voltage dependence to those produced by  xxxd2056xxx 
(see fig 8c). dimethadione also had no effect on the
voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (fig
8d) or on the time course of recovery from inactivation (not shown). these findings suggest that dimethadione may reduce calcium currents in thalamic
neurons through a mechanism similar to  xxxd2056xxx ’s. structural parallels between these two molecules may be related to their similar actions on calcium
currents (fig 9).

from  xxxd2056xxx  and dimethadione (see fig 9). it
has a very broad spectrum of action, including effectiveness in control of other types of generalized seizures 1251. when applied to thalamic neurons, valproic

discussion
we have previously reported that  xxxd2056xxx  reduces the ltcc in enzymatically dissociated thalamic
neurons el51 in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations very similar to the free serum levels achieved
in petit mal patients whose seizures were controlled
[21. our present results provide additional information about the nature of this reduction of ltcc by
 xxxd2056xxx .  xxxd2056xxx  effects occurred without

changes in the time course of activation or inactivation
of the ltcc and were evident over the entire voltage
activation range. further, reductions in ltcc occurred without alterations in the voltage dependence
of activation or steady-state inactivation, or the time
dependence of recovery from inactivation. taken together, these data suggest that ethoswimide does not
reduce the ltcc by exerting direct effects on channel
kinetics or gating mechanisms. rather, the results are
compatible with a decrease in the number of available
ltcc channels or in the elementary single ltcc
channel conductance. direct studies of ltcc channels
will be required to confirm this conclusion. dimethadione appeared to reduce ltcc by a similar voltage-dependent mechanism, but was less specific in that it significantly reduced the htcc as well as the ltcc.
twenty-three percent of the thalamic neurons studied did not respond to any concentration of  xxxd2056xxx  with a reduction in calcium current, even
though they possessed an ltcc that was indistinguishable from that in other, responsive neurons. this finding appears inconsistent with the ltcc channelblocking hypothesis:  xxxd2056xxx  channel-bloclung
actions would be expected to occur in all cells with
low-threshold calcium channels. it is possible that the
enzymatic treatment in some way altered the nonre-

sponsive cells so that they could not bind  xxxd2056xxx . by analogy with the actions of dihydropyridines
on sustained calcium current in other cells [28), the
receptor for  xxxd2056xxx  could be the low-threshold
calcium channel itself, somehow modified in a subset
of the cells so as to be inaccessible to ethoswimide.
alternatively, there may be subsets of relay neurons
that differ in their pharmacological sensitivity to these
agents.
consideration of the normal role of ltcc in the
behavior of thalamic neurons may provide insights
about the mechanisms by which  xxxd2056xxx -induced
depression of this current could lead to control of
spike-wave discharges. in contrast to its size in other
mammalian neurons [18,22,24], the ltcc is particularly prominent in thalamic cells, where its overall peak
amplitude is usually equal to or greater than that of the
htcc (e.g., figs 1, 4c, and [21)). this proportionally
large ltcc influences the behavior of thalamic neurons, as seen in current-clamp recordings, where large,
low-threshold calcium-dependent spikes (ltcss) are a
prominent feature of cell behavior [lo-131. given the
kinetics of its voltage- and time-dependence of activation, inactivation, and deinactivation (see figs 1-7)
111, 17, 22,241, the ltcc is the only calcium conductance that could be responsible for the ltcss. the
ltcs is particularly important in regulating the normal
oscillatory behavior of thalamic neurons [lo, 12-14].
normal afferent barrage, as occurs in the waking state,
will maintain the resting membrane potential at a depolarized level sufficient to inactivate the ltcs, so
that simple relay behavior without bursting predominates. under conditions where the membrane potential is hyperpolarized, either by reduction of afferent
drive (as in quiet sleep) or by strong hyperpolarizing
inputs (e.g., [13]), the ltcs will be deinactivated and
tend to promote bursting. sequential activation of the
ltcc and repolarizing potassium conductances can
produce intrinsic oscillatory behavior [lo- 12). these
properties, together with the tight reciprocal connectivity between the thalamus and cortex, predispose the
network to thalamocortical oscillations (reviewed in
[141) such as occur during sleep spindles.
although direct evidence is not available in animal
models of petit mal, or in humans, the above considerations make it likely that the ltcs and underlying
ltcc play in important role in generating the abnormal rhythmicity that characterizes spike-wave discharges. this conclusion is further supported by the
close relationship between spindles and spike waves
present both in the feline penicillin model of generalized spike-wave discharge 161 and in human petit mal
during spindle stage sleep (see kellaway 1291 for review) when spike-wave discharges are most prominent.

vate the ltcs in a postsynaptic population (e.g., [30)),
with resulting spike burst generation in thalamic neurons that would propagate over thalamocortical axons
and reactivate the cortical population. even small reductions in the ltcs with  xxxd2056xxx  would tend to
dampen or abolish this type of oscillation and hence
reduce spike-wave discharges and absence seizures.
these effects would be significantly enhanced by the
voltage dependence of the  xxxd2056xxx -induced
ltcc reduction (see fig 4), which would cause
threshold calcium conductances, evoked by small depolarizations from hyperpolarized potentials, to be
particularly affected. thus, the action of  xxxd2056xxx 
on ltcc of thalamic neurons seems consistent with its
anticonvulsant action in petit mal seizures, as does its
ability to reduce thalamocortical transmission selectively at 3 to 4 hz in vivo in cats [31, 321.
dimethadione reduced the ltcc to a greater extent than did  xxxd2056xxx  (maximal ltcc reductions, assessed during a voltage command to - 40 mv,
were 52.4% versus 31.9% for dimethadione and  xxxd2056xxx , respectively), although both drugs appeared
to act through similar mechanisms (cf., figs 3-6, 8).
this greater efficacy of dimethadione appears to be at
odds with the relative clinical effectiveness of these
two agents as anticonvulsants. because of their voltagedependent actions, however, these two agents were
equally effective in reducing calcium currents at
threshold potentials (cf., figs 4a, 8c). phenytoin,
which is also structurally similar to  xxxd2056xxx  (see
fig 9), reduces ltcc only at toxic concentrations (see
fig lo), and so its actions on ltcc are most likely
unrelated to its anticonvulsant action.
not all petit mal anticonvulsants share the action of
 xxxd2056xxx  on calcium currents in thalamic neurons.
 xxxd3485xxx  had no effect on ltcc in concentrations
up to 1 m.other effects of valproate 18, 33, 341 may
be responsible for its diverse anticonvulsant actions.
it is also conceivable that valproate metabolites not
tested in our acute experiments (e.g., 2-en-valproate,
3-keto-valproate, or various hydroxy-valproates; see
uscher and colleagues [351) have effects on the ltcc.
the finding that specific petit mal anticonvulsants
reduce ltcc in thalamic neurons does not necessarily
imply that abnormalities of ltcc regulation or function play a role in the pathogenesis of petit mal
epilepsy, although this will certainly be an interesting
hypothesis to explore. this result does suggest, however, that the ltcc is important in the generation and
maintenance of spike-wave discharges underlying petit
mal seizures and that modulation of the properties of
the ltcc could influence petit mal attacks. the wellknown effects of the level of arousal on both petit mal
seizures 1291 and thalamic ltcss 1141 may be an example of such modulatory influences. we are not implying that reductions in the ltcc are the only mech-

anism of action of  xxxd2056xxx , since other possible
effects in the thalamus or at other sites have not been
examined in this study (but see e31 for review). the
important finding is an effect of  xxxd2056xxx  that is
consistent with its anticonvulsant action. the ltcc
reduction occurs in clinically relevant drug concentration ranges and is shared by another specific petit mal
anticonvulsant (dimethadione). the effects of these
compounds on the ltcc are not mimicked by succinimide 1151, a close structural relative that is inactive
as an anticonvulsant 131. thus, ltcc reduction appears to be closely related to specific petit mal anticonvulsant effectiveness.
