pharmacological alterations of anxious behaviour in mice depending on both strain and the behavioural situation.  a previous study comparing non-emotive mice from the strain c57bl/6/byj with abp/le mice showed abp/le to be more anxious in an open-field situation. in the present study, several compounds affecting anxiety were assayed on abp/le and c57bl/6/byj mice using three behavioural models of anxiety: the elevated plus-maze, the light-dark discrimination test and the free exploratory paradigm. the compounds used were the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide, and the antagonist, flumazenil, the gaba(a) antagonist, bicuculline, the full 5-ht(1a) agonist 8-oh-dpat, and the mixed 5-ht(1a)/5-ht(1b) agonist, ru 24969. results showed the effect of the compounds to be dependent on both the strain and the behavioural task. several compounds found to be anxiolytic in abp/le mice had an anxiogenic effect on c57bl/6/byj mice. more behavioural changes were observed for abp/le in the elevated plus-maze, but the clearest findings for c57bl/6/byj mice were observed in the light-dark discrimination apparatus. these data demonstrate that anxious behaviour is a complex phenomenon which cannot be described by a single behavioural task nor by the action of a single compound.
