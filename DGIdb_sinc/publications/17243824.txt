abstract: identification of protein targets of bioactive small molecules has been a technical hurdle of
chemical genetics. here we report a polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets of small molecules
from cell lysates. the results indicate that insertion of a long, rigid polyproline helix between a smallmolecule bait and a biotin tag boosts the capacity of affinity purification and thereby permits isolation of
low-abundance or low-affinity proteins. in the course of the proof-of-concept experiments, we isolated
glyoxalase 1 ( xxxg898xxx ) as a new target of indomethacin, a widely used antiinflammatory drug. molecular
biological experiments suggest that inhibition of  xxxg898xxx  enzyme activity is related to the clinically recognized
beneficial side effects of the indomethacin family of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

introduction

one of the technical challenges in forward chemical genetics
and phenotype-based drug discovery is the identification of
protein targets of bioactive small molecules.1 the most straightforward approach to identifying protein targets is biochemical
isolation with affinity resins, in which a close analogue of a
small-molecule ligand is covalently attached to a solid support,2-5
or its biotinylated version is bound to avidin-agarose beads.6-13
the avidin-biotin affinity approach is based on the remarkably
strong noncovalent interaction between biotin and avidin and
has been offering a convenient preparation of affinity columns

of bioactive molecules since its introduction in 1976 by
hofmann and co-workers.14,15
one problem of the widely used avidin-biotin approach is
the low recovery of binding proteins relative to a high-density
direct conjugation approach. the crystal structure of avidin
bound to biotin indicates that biotin binds within a deep cleft
inside the core of avidin, and the distance from the bound biotin
molecule to the surface of avidin is as long as 7 å.16,17
commercially available biotinylation reagents are usually
composed of relatively short methylene or ethylene glycol
linkers (up to 14 å) and may not project the small-molecule
ligand away enough for the isolation of bulky binding proteins.
a longer linker with optimized chemical and physical properties
would be desirable.
our approach to designing such a linker stems from the
analogy of affinity purification to fishing, in which a rod is often
used to cast a fishhook away and to prevent tangles of fishing
lines. in our design, a rod-like polyproline helix is inserted
between a small-molecule bait and a biotin molecule. the stretch
of l-prolines forms a stable left-handed helix, and the length of
the 9-proline helix has been measured to be 27 å by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments.18,19 the rigid
polyproline helix may prevent folding of the linker and project

a small-molecule bait away from the biotin-avidin complex to
permit its interaction with protein targets.
here we demonstrate that the rigid polyproline linker
facilitates the biochemical isolation of protein targets. during
the course of the proof-of-concept experiments, we were able
to isolate glyoxalase 1 ( xxxg898xxx ) as a new target of indomethacin,
a clinically used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that is
known to inhibit cyclooxygenases. although the generality of
the approach needs to be addressed by many other molecules,
the results may suggest the utility of rod-like linkers in
increasing the success rates of biochemically isolating protein
targets of small molecules.
results

proof of concept with glutathione. the small molecule
that we initially used for proof of concept was glutathione, a
naturally occurring peptide that binds specifically to glutathiones-transferase (gst). biotinylated glutathione with varied lengths
of polyproline linkers (zero, six, and nine l-prolines) were
synthesized (figure 1a) and incubated with e. coli cell lysates
containing gst. while commercially available glutathionesepharose, in which a high density of glutathione molecules are
attached directly to the solid resin, works well in general due
to its high effective concentration, the biotinylated glutathione
with a methylene linker (1) bound to the avidin agarose resin
showed the limited ability to recover gst from the lysates
(figure 1b), representing the low-recovery problem of the
avidin-biotin affinity approach. in contrast, when a polyproline
linker (2 or 3) was inserted between glutathione and biotin, the
recovery rates of gst went up, and a longer 9-proline linker
(27 å) showed a higher recovery than the one with six prolines
(18 å) (figure 1b).
to compare the polyproline linker with poly(ethylene glycol)
(peg) linkers, water-soluble linkers widely used for affinity
purification, a series of peg-based linkers with varied lengths
(4-7; 11-32 å) were inserted between glutathione and biotin.
the longer peg linkers exhibited the higher recovery of gst
from the lysates. however, even the longest peg linker (7, 32
å) purified ∼1/4 times less gst than the 27-å polyproline
linker (3) (figure 1b). these results encouraged us to pursue
the idea of employing a proline-helix linker, rather than flexible
linkers, for isolating protein targets.
proof of concept with indomethacin. we next used
indomethacin (8) as a model of more drug-like organic
compounds. indomethacin is a clinically used antiinflammatory
drug that targets cyclooxygenases (coxs) and thereby inhibits
the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. as is often with smallmolecule drugs, biotin-indomethacin conjugates had limited
water solubility, rendering them hard to purify by reversedphase hplc. to improve the water-solubility, two lysine
residues were introduced between a biotin molecule and a
polyproline linker (figure 2a). the soluble version of the nineproline-rod-biotin-indomethacin conjugate (11) was then
examined for its ability to isolate endogenous cox-1 from
mammalian cell lysates. whole cell extracts of mouse sto cells
were incubated with conjugate 11, and bound proteins were
analyzed by western blots. as shown in figure 2b, conjugate
11 had greater ability to isolate cox-1 than control conjugates
9 and 10. excess amounts of free indomethacin abolished the
interaction between 11 and cox-1 (figure s1), suggesting that

affinity purification of gst from bacterial lysates. increasing amounts of
gst were purified by the biotinylated glutathione with a longer proline
linker (2 and 3) bound to the avidin agarose resin, whereas the one without
a polyproline linker (1) exhibited only limited ability to purify gst (upper
panel). the 27 å polyproline linker was also compared with polyethylene
glycol (peg) linkers (4-7) (lower panel). the 27 å polyproline linker
exhibited ∼4 times better recovery of gst than the 32 å peg linker.

the interaction is selective. silver staining of the gel showed a
faint but selective protein band whose electrophoretic mobility
matched that of cox-1 in the western blots (figure 2b). to
confirm the identity of the band, we scaled up the purification
100 times and excised a coomassie blue-stained band from a
gel. microsequencing analysis revealed three peptide sequences
that matched the amino-acid sequence of mouse cox-1
(alghgvdlghiygdnler, nfdyhvlhvavdvik, and
qlpdvqllaqqlllr). to our knowledge, this result represents the first successful isolation and microsequencing of an

polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets

improvement: capture and release. the cox-1 band in
figure 2b is specific but hard to detect due to the overlap with
nonspecific bands. microsequencing of 10 representative nonspecific bands revealed that many of them are associated with
the polyproline linker, including proline hydroxylase, 14-3-3,
and a number of heat-shock proteins. these nonspecific bands
can be removed by taking a capture and release approach, in
which a specific protease cleavage site is inserted between a
small molecule bait and a proline linker so that the bait and its
binding protein can be released by protease cleavage
(figure 3a).
the protease-based capture and release technique is not new
in affinity purification in general, but in many cases  xxxg741xxx 
is used as a releasing protease. in our attempt, a 6his-tagged
recombinant protein of bacterial hrv-c3 protease was chosen
due to its neutral recognition sequence and high activity and

selectivity even at 4 °c.20 the presence of a 6his tag also
permits convenient removal of the protease from the sample
after cleavage.
such a capture-and-release version of the indomethacin
conjugate 12 was synthesized and tested for the ability to purify
cox-1 from sto cell lysates. when a protease-treated sample
was analyzed on a silver-stained sds gel, the number of
nonspecific bands was reduced, and, as a result, the cox-1
band became more visible on the gel than it was in a sample
eluted simply by sds (figure 3b). the combination of the
capture-and-release and proline-rod approaches may permit the
isolation and detection of the low-abundance proteins that bind
to drug-like small molecules.
identification of glyoxalase 1 as a target of indomethacin.
while conducting the capture-and-release experiments with
indomethacin, we noticed another specific band in the lower
molecular weight region of the gels (figure 3b). microsequencing analysis of the band revealed 14 peptide sequences that all
matched the amino acid sequence of mouse glyoxalase 1
( xxxg898xxx ).

glycolysis, to d-lactate.21,22 the direct substrate of  xxxg898xxx  is the
hemithioacetal form of methylglyoxal produced by the nonenzymatic conjugation with glutathione, and its product is s-dlactoylglutathione, which is then hydrolyzed by  xxxg1015xxx  to
d-lactate (scheme 1). notwithstanding the numerous previous
studies,  xxxg898xxx  has never been reported or suggested to be a
binding target of indomethacin or any other antiinflammatory
drugs.
to examine the effect of indomethacin on the enzymatic
activity of  xxxg898xxx , the catalytic activity of recombinant  xxxg898xxx 
was measured in the presence of varied concentrations of
indomethacin. dixon plot and lineweaver-burk plot analyses
showed that indomethacin competitively inhibits  xxxg898xxx  with a
ki value of 18.1 µm (figure s2). this high range of ki may
still be comparable to the ki value reported for cox-2 (5 µm),
a known pharmacological target of indomethacin, and could be
physiological considering a high dose administration of indomethacin in the clinic.23 when 12 other antiinflammatory
drugs that target cox-2 (figure 4) were evaluated, acemetacin,
a close analogue of indomethacin, exhibited comparable inhibitory activity (ki ) 12.1 µm), and other members of indomethacin class of drugs ( xxxd3259xxx ,  xxxd3396xxx ,  xxxd3563xxx ) showed weak
but detectable activity. in contrast, antiinflammatory drugs of
other chemical classes including aspirin, ibuprofen, and vioxx
had little or no detectable effects on  xxxg898xxx  (table 1).
a similar trend was observed when kd was measured by
isothermal titration microcalorimetry (itc). the kd of indomethacin for  xxxg898xxx  was estimated to be 4.0 µm with
stoichiometry of 1.06 ( 0.08, and  xxxd3563xxx , which had a five
times weaker ki, exhibited a paralleled kd (18 µm) (figure s3).
nmr titration experiments indicated that the addition of  xxxg898xxx 
diminished selective proton signals of indomethacin, especially
those arising from the methylene (3.53 ppm), 2-methyl (2.18
ppm), and methoxy (3.82 ppm) protons (figure 5). the signal
losses are consistent with the low-µm kd of the interaction where
the exchange rate between the free and bound states is often
intermediate at the nmr time scale and the perturbations of
the methylene and 2-methyl groups are also in agreement with
their importance in the structure-activity relationship for  xxxg898xxx .
[in slow exchange (<∼100 s-1), separate resonances are seen
for each of the two states. by contrast, in fast exchange
(>∼1000 s-1), a single averaged resonance is observed. in the
intermediate exchange region, resonances broaden, often becoming unobservable. detailed descriptions of these exchange

flammatory drugs including indomethacin have mild anticancer
properties as a side effect, especially when combined with
chemotherapy.24-27 epidemiological studies have also shown
that regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs reduces
the risk of developing cancers.27,28 in cultured cells, the
indomethacin family, but not other types of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, potentiates the cytotoxicity of anthracycline anticancer drugs,29 implying that the property is unique
to the indomethacin family. indomethacin retains such activity

against hct15 human crc cells (which do not express either
cox-1 or cox-2) and cox-1/cox-2-null transformed murine
embryonic fibroblasts.30 therefore, the beneficial side effect of
indomethacin appears to occur via a cox-independent mechanism.
to evaluate a relationship between  xxxg898xxx  and the side effect,
we chose three antiinflammatory drugs, indomethacin (strong
 xxxg898xxx  inhibition),  xxxd3396xxx  (mild  xxxg898xxx  inhibition), and aspirin
(no  xxxg898xxx  inhibition) and assayed their ability to enhance the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, a prototypic anthracycline anticancer
drug.29 although indomethacin alone had no cytotoxic effects
on lung cancer a549 cells up to 32 µm, indomethacin at lower
concentrations potentiated the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin
(figure 6a).  xxxd3396xxx  showed no potentiation of doxorubicin
in the same concentration range, but at the higher concentrations
(up to 400 µm),  xxxd3396xxx  enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (figure 6b). in contrast, aspirin had no detectable effects
even at 1 mm (figure 6c). these results correspond with the
ki value of the three drugs for  xxxg898xxx , suggesting that indomethacin sensitizes cells to doxorubicin by inhibiting the
enzymatic activity of  xxxg898xxx .
to further evaluate the role of  xxxg898xxx  in the synergy of
indomethacin and doxorubicin, we modulated expression levels
of  xxxg898xxx  by transfecting its cdna or sirna and examined
the effects on the drug response. stable transfection of a  xxxg898xxx 
expression vector into a549 cells yielded three  xxxg898xxx -overexpressing cell lines that have 1.4- to 6.6-fold expression levels
of  xxxg898xxx  compared with the parental cells (cell line i; 6.6 fold,
cell line ii; 1.4 fold, and cell line iii; 3.8 fold, figure 7b). when
the cells were cotreated with doxorubicin and indomethacin,
the cell lines with the higher  xxxg898xxx  expression were more

resistant to the drug treatment than the parental cells (figure
7a), presumably because the higher concentrations of indomethacin are required for complete inhibition of  xxxg898xxx  in
the overexpressing cells.
selective silencing of the  xxxg898xxx  expression was achieved by
transiently transfecting  xxxg898xxx  sirna (figure 8a). the glo1silenced cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin than the mocktransfected cells were, and indomethacin had limited ability to
further potentiate the doxorubicin activity in the  xxxg898xxx -silenced
cells (figure 8b). therefore, selective silencing of  xxxg898xxx 
expression replaced indomethacin for enhancing the doxorubicin
activity. these results support our notion that inhibition of  xxxg898xxx 
is responsible for indomethacin-mediated enhancement of the
doxorubicin activity.

biochemical isolation of small molecule targets. the small
molecules whose target identification provided significant
impacts on biology are mostly natural products with potent
biological activity, with a few exceptions including those of beta

blockers6 and more recently tws119.4 the naturally validated
bioactive compounds tend to be highly specific toward the gene
products with which they coevolved, and therefore natural
products have generally been thought more suited for target
identification than synthetic molecules have been. however, an
increasing number of research tools and drug leads are
discovered from phenotypic screening of synthetic compound
libraries. target identification of the synthetic molecules is a
bottleneck in chemical genetics and phenotype-based drug
discovery.
one drawback of the library-derived compounds is that they
are usually not highly potent and may bind several different
proteins with low affinity, typically with a kd of low µm.
successful isolation of these low-affinity targets would increase
the value of the library-derived synthetic molecules for biological investigation. in this particular study, the polyproline-linker
approach enabled isolation of  xxxg898xxx  as a target of indomethacin.
the ki and kd of indomethacin to  xxxg898xxx  are in a low µm range,
but  xxxg898xxx  inhibition appears to be responsible for the additive
effects of indomethacin and anthracyclines on cultured cells and
could be relevant to the clinical observation. our results
encourage exploration of low-µm affinity yet pharmacologically
relevant targets with affinity-based biochemical purification.
a problem common in natural products and library-derived
synthetic compounds is that physiological targets may not be
abundant in cell lysates and could be underrepresented on a
stained sds gel. in such a case, high recovery or enrichment
of the target is required for the successful isolation.1 in our
particular case, the insertion of a long, rigid polyproline linker

polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets

enhanced the recovery of cox-1, a low-abundance protein in
cell lysates. further design of rod-like, and preferably hydrophilic, linkers would increase the success rates of isolating lowabundance proteins.
the generality of the approach needs to be addressed by many
other bioactive small molecules including natural products, and
such studies are currently underway. we note that the applicability of the polyproline-linker approach may depend on
the characteristics of binding proteins. for instance, a biotinylated methotrexate molecule without a proline linker isolated
its target,  xxxg631xxx , at a reasonable yield, and
coupling of a proline linker enhanced the isolation only less
than 2-fold in our hands (data not shown). the proline-linker
approach may prove to be useful for isolating hard-to-isolate
proteins.
 xxxg898xxx  and indomethacin. our study identified  xxxg898xxx  as a
binding protein of indomethacin and implicated the inhibition
of  xxxg898xxx  in the sensitization of lung cancer cells to the effects
of doxorubicin. further support for the involvement of  xxxg898xxx 
in the cancer-drug sensitivity can be found in literature. a
subtractive gene hybridization study on chemoresistant leukemia
cells has shown that  xxxg898xxx  is overexpressed selectively in the
chemoresistant cells, and stable integration of a  xxxg898xxx  gene into
human jurkat cells rendered the cells resistant to adriamycin, a
prototypic anthracycline cancer drug.31 increased  xxxg898xxx  expression has also been found in invasive ovarian,32 prostate,33 and
breast cancers.34
it remains unclear how the inhibition of  xxxg898xxx  enhances the
effects of anthracycline cancer drugs. it is possible to imagine
that  xxxg898xxx  directly reacts and detoxifies the drugs. however,
this possibility may be unlikely because 1 day-incubation of
 xxxg898xxx  with doxorubicin had no impacts on the chromatographic
and the spectroscopic profile of doxorubicin (data not shown).
a recent study has shown that increased glycolytic flux causes
increased methylglyoxal modification of corepressor msin3a
and thereby modulates gene expression.35 such methylglyoxalinitiated modulation of gene expression may mediate the synergy
between indomethacin and anthracycline cancer drugs.
there is now ample clinical evidence that indomethacin has
a number of side effects including the beneficial one in oncology
as well as adverse ones such as gastroduodenal ulceration,
headache, and dizziness. it is not difficult to suppose that
indomethacin interacts with a number of unknown targets that
our approach failed to detect. nonetheless, the finding of  xxxg898xxx 
as an additional target of indomethacin may lead to a better
understanding of these pharmacological effects other than
antiinflammation and to development of novel anticancer agents
or safer derivatives of indomethacin.

96-well plates, and doxorubicin and each antiinflammatory drug were
added on day 2. four days after the drug addition, cell viability was
evaluated by using wst-1 reagent.29 the results were also confirmed
by manual cell counting.
isothermal titration microcalorimetry (itc) measurement. the
binding of  xxxg898xxx  to indomethacin was analyzed by a microcal vpitc calorimeter. a solution of the recombinant mouse  xxxg898xxx  (10 µm)
was titrated with an indomethacin solution (280 µm) or a  xxxd3563xxx 
solution (2 mm) at 28 °c in a tris-buffered saline containing 1% dmso
(tbs: 20 mm tris, 100 mm nacl, 1% dmso, ph 6.8). binding
enthalpy (∆h), equilibrium-binding constant (ka), and binding stoichiometry (n) were obtained through the analysis of titration data.
nmr studies. indomethacin and methanol was dissolved in pbs
containing 5% d2o at a concentration of 100 µm. assignments of the
proton signals were achieved by 1d and 2d nmr experiments. a pbs
solution of  xxxg898xxx  (100 µm) was gradually added to an nmr sample
of indomethacin, and a one-dimensional 1h spectrum was collected
after each addition of the protein. nmr experiments were performed
on a bruker avance 600 mhz spectrometer. the data were processed
using uxnmr (bruker), and proton chemical shifts were referenced
to the h2o resonance (4.70 ppm at 298 k). the one-dimensional 1h
nmr spectra were recorded with 14 ppm spectral width, 8192 data
points, and 298 k temperature. suppression of the h2o resonance was
achieved by an excitation sculpting gradient pulse.
