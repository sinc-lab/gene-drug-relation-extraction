in mouse uterine tissue

abstract. the effect of estrogens on incorporation of labeled precursor into inositol-containing phospholipids (pi) from
ovariectomized mouse uterus was investigated. the results indicate that diethylstilbestrol (des) a potent mitogen, stimulated
incorporation of myo-[3h]inositol into uterine pi in 1-3 h, with
maximal incorporation occurring at 6 h. this activity followed
a dose-dependent increase, with a maximal effect at 5 ^s/kgincorporation of radiolabeled phosphorous into the polyphosphoinositides was also increased in estrogen-stimulated uterine

tissue. studies using a weak uterotropic des derivative, z,zdienestrol, produced an early stimulation of the pi response
comparable to des. this activity was increased by z,z- xxxd1878xxx , with minimal  xxxg730xxx  occupancy, and did not
result in stimulation of dna synthesis. these findings would
suggest that uterine pi stimulation may not occur via an estrogen
receptor-mediated mechanism related to tissue proliferation induced by estrogens. {endocrinology 121: 1083-1088,1987)

t

is not completely understood, it is thought that stimulation of proliferation occurs via a receptor-mediated
process within the target tissue. inherent in such a
mechanism is the estrogen-induced synthesis of a variety
of proteins, one or more of which may be involved in the
proliferation response. recently, it has been reported
that estrogens may stimulate an increase in certain
growth factors in rodent uterine tissue (10-12). other
evidence suggests that estrogen stimulates epidermal
growth factor receptor levels in uterine tissue (13).
therefore, it is possible that uterine cell proliferation
may be mediated in part by growth factors not classically
associated with estrogen action.
since estrogens possibly stimulate the release of
growth factors in rodent uteri, and since the pi cycle
may play a role in mediating the action of certain growth
factors, an investigation was undertaken to determine if
estrogen treatment would stimulate the pi cycle in uterine tissue.

he metabolism of inositol-containing phospholipids (pi) is thought to play a key role in the
mechanisms of several cellular processes (including secretion, platelet aggregation, and proliferation) induced
by a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and other
mitogenic agents (1-3). these agents bind to and activate
plasma membrane receptors. the activated receptors
stimulate a pi-specific phospholipase c, which degrades
the phospholipids to phosphorylinositols (ips) and 1,2diacylglycerol. one of the ips (ip3) has recently been
reported to bind to a specific receptor in the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane and cause the release of ca2+ from
the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol (4-6). diacylglycerol is known to activate the ca2+- and phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase c (6, 8). both ips and
diacylglycerol are metabolized and reused in the synthesis of new pi (8). the stimulated degradation followed
by the synthesis of pi constitutes the pi cycle and results
in the generation of second messengers (ip3 and diacylglycerol), which are implicated in the mechanism of cell
proliferation induced by some growth factors (6-8).
estrogens, when administered to mature ovariectomized mice, stimulate proliferation of the luminal epithelial cells of the uterus (9). although the mechanism

dium. for receptor binding assays, uteri were removed and
placed in ice-cold tegm buffer, ph 8.0, at 4 c (10 mm tris,
1.5 mm disodium edta, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm mgcl2).
nuclear and cytoplasmic  xxxg730xxx  levels were quantified as previously described (14). dna values were determined
by the burton procedure (15) or the hoescht dye method (16),
using calf thymus dna (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo)
as standard.
labeling conditions
the basal medium used in these experiments was ham's
f-12-dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, and it was supplemented with 10 fig/m\ insulin, 10 mg/ml transferrin, and 10 ng/
ml selenium (complete medium). the time of incubation and
half of one uterine horn per 2 ml medium were shown to be
optimal, and linearity of incorporation of labeled inositol was
achieved (data not presented). multiple tissue samples were
taken from different animals. to begin incorporation of myo[3h]inositol into uterine phospholipids, the tubes were warmed
for 2 min in a 37 c water bath and placed in a humidified
incubator under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 at 37
c. after every 0.5 h of incubation the tubes were vortexed
briefly. after termination of incubation the tubes were placed
on ice, and the tissue was washed four times with ice-cold
radioisotope-free labeling medium at 2 ml/wash. after the last
wash, the tissue was homogenized with a polytron (brinkmann
instruments, westbury, ny) for 10 sec at a setting of 6 in 0.8
ml ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered
saline (ph 7.4). in experiments in which protein was analyzed,
the tissue was homogenized in 1 ml cmf-pbs, and 200 ixi were
saved for analysis by the method of lowry et al. (17). the 0.8
ml homogenized tissue were extracted using the bligh-dyer
(18) lipid extraction method or a modified bligh-dyer technique
using 3 ml of an extracting solution [chloroform-methanolconcentrated hc1-edta (10:20:1:3)]. two phases were formed
by adding 1 ml chloroform followed by 1 ml water to each tube,
with vortexing after each addition. after incubating at room
temperature overnight, the upper phases were discarded, and
the lower phases containing the extracted lipids were washed
with fresh upper phase prepared using identical ratios of extraction mixture components. half of the chloroform layer
(lower phase) was saved for phosphate analysis by the method
of ames (19), and the remaining phospholipids were dried under
a stream of n2 and counted in a scintillation counter (beckman,
palo alto, ca) or subjected to tlc.
tlc
phospholipids to be resolved by tlc were solubilized in 100
(a chloroform, spotted, and separated on silica gel-60 plates
(e. merck reagents, rahway, nj). the tlc plates were developed with the system of pappas et al. (20), which resolves
phosphotidylcholine,  xxxd1857xxx , phosphotidylethanolamine, and pi or with  xxxd3026xxx -ammonium hydroxide (4 n)
at a ratio of 65:35, which separates the polyphosphoinositides
(21) from other phospholipids. phospholipid standards (sigma
chemical co.) were added to the tubes containing the extracts
before drying with n2 and were chromatographed along with

the samples. the standards were identified with iodine vapor,
and the appropriate regions on some tlc plates were scraped
and counted in a gel containing 1 ml water and 3 ml aquasol
(new england nuclear, boston, ma). tlc plates that contained [32p] -labeled phospholipids were dried at room temperature for 1 h and autoradiographed using xar-5 kodak x-ray
film (eastman kodak, rochester, ny) or cronex 4 medical
x-ray film (dupont, wilmington, de). the phospholipid standards along with exposed spots on the autoradiographs were used
in determining areas on the tlc plate to be scraped and
counted.
source of chemicals
myo-[a-n-3h]inositol (12.5 ci/mmol), [me£/ry/-3h]choline
chloride (80 ci/mmol), and [32p]orthophosphoric acid (hc1free) were obtained from new england nuclear. medium components were purchased from gibco (grand island, ny), except
for insulin, transferrin, and selenium which were obtained from
collaborative research (waltham, ma). organic chemicals
used in phospholipid extraction or for developing tlc plates
were obtained from j. t. baker chemical co. (philipsburg,
nj). 17i8-[2,4,6,7-3h]estradiol (98 ci/mmol) was purchased
from new england nuclear and brought to greater than 98%
radiochemical purity by tlc (benzene- xxxd2052xxx , 1:1). a
varian radiochromatogram scanner (lb-2723, varian associates, palo alto, ca) was used for analysis; steroids were also
identified by reference to simultaneously chromatographed unlabeled standards. unlabeled estradiol and diethylstilbestrol
(des) were obtained from steraloids, inc. (wilton, nh) and
used without further purification. nylestriol (17a- xxxd2054xxx -3-cyclopentyl ether) was a gift of lilly research laboratories (indianapolis, in). z,z- xxxd1878xxx  was a gift of dr.
manfred metzler (university of wiirzburg, wiirzburg, west
germany).

results
when uterine tissue from ovariectomized mice that
had been injected with des for various times before
death was incubated in the presence of labeled inositol,
there was an increase in incorporation of label into pi
which was dependent on the length of time after injection
of des (fig. 1). the data suggest that des stimulated
synthesis of pi, compared to that in vehicle controls, by
2 h, maximally by 6 h, and synthetic activity remained
elevated through the first 24 h after treatment (fig. 1).
analysis by tlc of the extracted radioactive lipids from
the des-treated group indicated that greater than 96%
of the incorporated label chromatographed with authentic pi standard (data not shown). comparative studies
on incorporation of [me£/i;y/-3h]choline revealed a lack
of stimulation at early times (2 h), with only a weak
(~30%) increase by 24 h after des treatment (data not
shown).
in the preceding experiments a dose of des that
maximally stimulated proliferation of uterine epithelium
(20 mg/kg) was employed. when different des doses

various times were incubated with labeled inositol (4 ^ci/ml), and
radioactivity incorporated into pi (disintegrations per min/nmol phosphate) was determined, as discussed in materials and methods. data
represent analysis of six uteri and are expressed as the mean and sem.
analysis of variance indicated no variation between control groups (p
> 0.10) and a significant overall effect of treatment (f = 50.59; p <
0.0001). individual groups were tested by dunnett's t test, with 3.5 h
not different from the control value; all others were different (4 h, p <
0.05; 6-24 h, p < 0.003).

the stimulated synthesis increased to 550% of the control
value by 24 h of treatment. the delayed nylestriol time
course is consistent with delayed  xxxg730xxx  interactions of this compound and suggests that stimulation
of pi synthesis may be an estrogen-specific response
rather than a generalized effect of hormone treatment.
compared to incorporation of [3h] inositol into pi,
incorporation of [32p]inorganic phosphate into the polyphosphoinositides is a much more sensitive measure of
pi metabolism. to further support the findings in figs.
1-3, we investigated the effects of des and nylestriol on
incorporation of [32p] inorganic phosphate into the polyphosphoinositides. after tlc in a system that resolves
the polyphosphoinosides, both des and nylestriol stimulated incorporation of radioactivity into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) and also into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pip) 3 h after injection (table
1). there was no apparent increase in incorporation of
inositol into the other phospholipids in any of the samples. the stimulation induced by nylestriol remained
higher at 6 h for pip2, but showed a return to control by
24 h after injection. these results confirm that both
estrogens stimulate pip 2 and pip metabolism in mouse
uterine tissue.
to study further the specificity of the des-induced
stimulation, the effect of a very weak estrogen agonist
(z,z- xxxd1878xxx ) on stimulation of pi metabolism was
investigated. z,z- xxxd1878xxx  is chemically similar to
des, with comparable lipophibicity, but significantly

above the saline control value.
this pi response occurred at doses of z,z- xxxd1878xxx 
that produced minimal nuclear  xxxg730xxx  occupancy at 1 h (fig. 4). a low dose (2.5 ng/kg) of des
produced the same level of nuclear  xxxg730xxx 
occupancy as the 100 or 200 ng/kg dose of z,z- xxxd1878xxx .
uterotropic stimulation could not be achieved by a single
injection of z,z- xxxd1878xxx  at doses of 50-200 fxg/kg.
three multiple injections every 4 h of 200 mg/kg did not
significantly stimulate uterine growth. the  xxxd1878xxx 
response was not delayed, as seen with nylestriol (22),
since uterine weight was followed up to 72 h after injection with no increase observed. the low nuclear receptor
occupancy induced by z,z- xxxd1878xxx  resulted in no uterine dna synthesis (fig. 5) even at a dose of 100 ixg/kg,
which produced maximal early pi cycle stimulation.
however, this low level of receptor was sufficient to
produce a significant dna synthesis response to des.

discussion
estrogens have been reported to stimulate the synthesis of lipids in rat uteri by the activation of a biosynthetic
step(s) that is common to lipid synthesis in general (25,
26). evidence presented in this communication suggests

either dose of z,z- xxxd1878xxx  was comparable to that seen

that in mouse uteri, estrogens specifically stimulate the
synthesis of pl possibly, the differences in stimulated
rat (25, 26) and mouse uterine lipid metabolism are due
to different mechanisms of hormone action or different
estrogens used, since in the earlier study estradiol was
the test compound. this is consistent with other work
showing that the time course of dna synthesis and cell
division is different in the uteri of rats (27) and mice (9).
most likely, these differences may arise from differences
in techniques. whereas the previous investigators used
general lipid precursors, such as radiolabeled acetate or
orthophosphate (25, 26), we used radiolabeled inositol,
which is a specific precursor for pi, in order to investigate
pi synthesis. the use of inositol as a specific precursor
facilitates the investigation of differences in the synthesis of pi that could be obscured by the other more
abundant phospholipids in studies using general phospholipid precursors. this would be especially true if
complete resolution of pi from the other phospholipids
did not take place during tlc.
the mechanism by which estrogens stimulate incorporation of radiolabeled inositol into pi may be via
stimulation of the de novo synthesis of pl such a mechanism would by necessity involve the induction or activation of an enzyme specific for pi synthesis, such as
cdp-diacylglycerol inositol phosphatidyltransferase. if
de novo synthesis of pi were induced at a step before
phosphatidic acid, one would expect to observe a non-

1087

specific stimulation of the synthesis of the total phospholipid fraction, since phosphatidic acid is a precursor
of phospholipids in general. another way that estrogens
could stimulate incorporation of label specifically into
pi is by stimulating the pi cycle. this possibility is
intriguing since there is a reported correlation between
the pi cycle and mitogenesis induced by platelet-derived
growth factor (1), lymphocytic proliferation stimulated
by phytohemagglutinin (2), or a number of cellular responses in a variety of tissues possessing receptors for
appropriate stimuli (for review, see ref. 3).
nylestriol, an estrogen steroid derivative which stimulates the rat uterus at a time later than des or estradiol
(22), also stimulated pi synthesis on a later time course.
this difference in temporal pattern is consistent with
the later time course of receptor interaction observed in
the mouse uterus and previously reported in the rat
uterus. the nylestriol data suggested some involvement
of the  xxxg730xxx  in the stimulation of the pi
response.
results from the studies with the  xxxd1880xxx  derivative
and metabolite z,z- xxxd1878xxx  indicate a possible  xxxg730xxx -independent action, at least for the early
times. this compound shares similar chemical features
with des, except for its poor receptor binding and uterotropic activity (28, 29). at low concentrations of z,zdienestrol (20 ng/kg) there is a dramatic stimulation of
the pi response above the control value for the first 2 h
even though there is only a slight (2-fold) increase in
nuclear  xxxg730xxx  occupancy. in time-course
studies, not using a 200 iig/kg dose of z,z- xxxd1878xxx , the
earlier increase in nuclear  xxxg730xxx  is transient
and returns to control levels in 2 h, and there is no
uterine wet weight stimulation. therefore, the compound
is not similar to estriol, since neither high doses nor
multiple injections will produce uterine weight stimulation even at early times. the low nuclear receptor levels
produced by z,z- xxxd1878xxx  are consistent with both the
low receptor-binding affinity and uterotropic activity and
the inability to stimulate uterine dna synthesis. the
apparent lack of association between the early pi response and nuclear  xxxg730xxx  interaction is further strengthened by the results of studies using the 100
/ig/kg z,z- xxxd1878xxx  dose, where stimulation of dna
synthesis is not evident. only a small increase in nuclear
 xxxg730xxx  levels is seen, but this is sufficient to
stimulate a maximal pi response. this low nuclear receptor level produced by z,z- xxxd1878xxx  is not the reason
for the inability to stimulate dna synthesis, since des
samples at 2.5 ixg/kg produced essentially the same level
of nuclear receptor but resulted in a 400% increase in
dna synthesis.
one explanation for the data from the z,z- xxxd1878xxx 
experiments is that the early hormone-stimulated pi

uterine phosphatidylinositol metabolism

response is probably not a nuclear receptor-mediated
response. if such is the case, the stimulation of pi synthesis may be related to early aspects of uterine estrogen
hormone action and not to later growth responses (27,
28). one example of a possible effect that is not receptor
mediated is the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis
by estrogenic hormones acting as cooxidative substrates
for prostaglandin synthesis (29). recent evidence indicates that prostaglandin synthesis (30) and phospholipid
methylation (31) activity occur within uterine epithelial
cells. such an estrogen-induced increase in prostanoids
could stimulate the increase in the pi response, since
prostanoids are known to induce the pi cycle in some
cell types (32). however, since the des metabolite did
bind slightly to nuclear receptor at 20 /xg/kg, a spare
receptor mechanism is also possible, in which the early
pi response occurs at much lower receptor occupancy
levels than does stimulation of dna synthesis. such a
concept would suggest that pi metabolism is not sufficient by itself and requires other nuclear receptor-mediated events to initiate dna synthesis. on the other hand,
the longer time of pi stimulation seen with des compared to z,z- xxxd1878xxx  may indicate a longer temporal
requirement for pi activity as it relates to stimulating
dna synthesis. such a possibility is strengthened from
studies on the mitogenic action of a-thrombin on fibroblasts that suggest a requirement for continued stimulation by a-thrombin of pi turnover (33, 34). additional
studies are in progress to investigate the relationship of
protein kinase c and phospholipids to estrogen action
and to determine the exact site where estrogens act in
the pi cycle.
