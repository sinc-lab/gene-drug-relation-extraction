abstract
3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma; ‘ecstasy’) is a
popular recreational drug used worldwide. this study aimed to
determine the effects of this compound on the expression of
nerve terminal serotonergic markers in rats. experiment 1
investigated mdma-induced changes in levels of the serotonin transporter (sert) and the  xxxg2099xxx  ( xxxg2099xxx -2) in the hippocampus, a region with sparse
dopaminergic innervation, after lesioning noradrenergic input
with n-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (dsp-4).
adult male sprague–dawley rats were administered 100 mg/
kg dsp-4 or saline 1 week prior to either an mdma (10 mg/
kg · 4) or saline binge. two weeks following the binge treatment, the dsp-4/mdma group unexpectedly showed little
change in hippocampal  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein expression compared

with dsp-4/saline controls, despite large reductions in sert
levels in all regions examined in the mdma-treated animals.
furthermore, animals treated with binge mdma (experiment
2) showed a striking decrease in sert gene expression (and
a lesser effect on  xxxg2099xxx -2) measured by quantitative rt-pcr
in pooled dorsal and median raphe tissue punches, when
compared with saline-treated controls. these results demonstrate that mdma causes substantial regulatory changes in
the expression of serotonergic markers, thus questioning the
need to invoke distal axotomy as an explanation of mdmarelated serotonergic deficits.

3,4- xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma; ‘ecstasy’) is a ring-substituted amphetamine
derivative, the use of which is prevalent among adolescents
and adults (banken 2004; unodcc, 2008). high doses of
this compound in rats lead to signiﬁcant decrements in
markers of serotonergic axons and terminals while sparing
cells of the raphe nuclei (o’hearn et al. 1988; battaglia et al.
1991). more speciﬁcally, mdma causes depletions in
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) and the major 5-ht
metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, decreases in tryptophan hydroxylase (tph) activity, and reduced levels of the
serotonin transporter (sert) as measured either by membrane binding or autoradiography (green et al. 2003). several
studies have also found reductions in 5-ht-, tph-, or sertimmunoreactive ﬁber density (green et al. 2003; xie et al.
2006), which has been interpreted as mdma-induced
degeneration of distal serotonergic axons and nerve terminals.
the signiﬁcance of mdma effects on levels of these
axon/terminal markers has been debated for over two

decades (see molliver et al. 1990; ricaurte et al. 2000;
baumann et al. 2007). although it is certainly possible that
the observed changes result from neurotoxic damage (i.e.

‘terminal pruning’), it should also be recognized that these
measures are all indirect and subject to regulation. for
example, it is well known that mdma acutely inhibits tph
(schmidt and taylor 1987) and, in the case of multiple doses,
causes long-term reductions in tph activity (stone et al.
1987). because tph is rate-limiting for 5-ht biosynthesis, it
is likely that decreases in this enzyme restrict the extent of 5ht production, thus reducing the levels of this neurotransmitter regardless of whether or not axonal damage has
occurred. moreover, mdma has been reported to alter sert
gene expression (kovács et al. 2007; kirilly et al. 2008),
which could lead to changes in sert protein levels
independent of axotomy. finally, this transporter is subject
to endosomal trafﬁcking (ramamoorthy and blakely 1999;
carneiro and blakely 2006), bringing into question the
signiﬁcance of mdma-induced reductions in sert binding
when such assays involve the use of plasma membrane
preparations. consequently, it is difﬁcult to distinguish
whether diminution in expression of various serotonergic
markers following mdma exposure results from actual
damage, as a consequence of selective depletion or downregulation of each marker in the absence of axotomy, or both.
to help resolve this controversy, this study provides new
evidence concerning the effects of mdma on protein and
gene expression of two different markers of serotonergic
nerve terminals. two weeks following binge administration
of mdma in rats, we used validated immunoblotting
methods as well as quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis
to measure drug-induced changes in the protein (experiment
1) and gene expression (experiment 2) of sert and the
 xxxg2099xxx  ( xxxg2099xxx -2). the differential pattern of mdma effects on these markers suggests that
this compound may adversely affect serotonergic neurons
without necessarily inducing neurodegeneration.

standard plastic tubs with a bedding of wood shavings, with food
and water available ad lib. pregnant dams were singly housed
under a standard 12 : 12 h light–dark cycle, while all other
animals were pair-housed under a reverse 12 : 12 h light–dark
cycle (lights on  xxxd2274xxx  pm). all male rats and mice were habituated
to the experimenters by gentle handling for 1 min each day for
at least 3 days prior to the beginning of drug administration or
killing. animal care was in accordance with the guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals (institute of laboratory
animal resources, commission on life sciences, national
research council, 1996), and the experimental protocols were
approved by the university of massachusetts-amherst institutional animal care and use committee.

materials and methods

5,7-dihydroxytryptamine administration
as part of the initial validation of our sert immunoblotting
procedures in experiment 1, neonatal rats were administered the 5ht neurotoxin 5,7-dht to lesion serotonergic ﬁbers. this compound was given to neonatal animals because they lack an efﬁcient
blood–brain barrier, thereby allowing peripheral administration
(towle et al. 1984; pranzatelli and martens 1992). on the day of
parturition (postnatal day 0; pd0), litters were culled to eight male
pups, and each litter was randomly assigned to the treatment or
control condition (n = 1 litter per group). on pd2, pups in the
treatment group were administered 20 mg/kg desipramine i.p.
60 min prior to a 100 mg/kg i.p. administration of 5,7-dht
dissolved in 0.9% nacl vehicle containing 0.1%  xxxd228xxx .
this treatment was repeated on pd 5. pups in the control group were
given i.p. injections of saline vehicle on both days. all pups were
housed with their respective dams until weaning at pd 25, after
which they were pair-housed until pd 35 when they were killed and
brain tissues were collected as described in the section on animal
killing and tissue dissection.

drugs and antibodies
mdma hcl was generously provided by the national institute
on drug abuse drug supply program (rti international,
research triangle park, nc, usa). 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
(5,7-dht) creatinine sulfate, methamphetamine (meth) hcl,
and
n-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine
(dsp-4)
were obtained from sigma chemical company (st louis, mo,
usa). anti-sert (pc177l) and anti- xxxg2099xxx -2 (ab1767) antibodies were obtained from calbiochem (san diego, ca, usa).
anti-b-actin antibodies were purchased from sigma chemical
company.
vertebrate animals
adult male sprague–dawley rats (experiments 1 and 2) or
pregnant dams (experiment 1) were obtained from charles river
laboratories (kingston, ny, usa). male wild-type and sertknockout (ko) bj.6 mice (experiment 1) were obtained from
taconic farms (hudson, ny, usa). all animals were housed in

animal killing and tissue dissection
in experiment 1, on the day of killing, animals were lightly
anesthetized with co2 and decapitated. brains were rapidly
removed, chilled by immersion in ice-cold 0.9% nacl for 1 min,
and then placed into an acrylic brain block (braintree scientiﬁc,
braintree, ma, usa). a 2-mm thick slice beginning 4 mm from
the anterior pole was removed, and the parietal cortex was
separated from the underlying striatum. where applicable, the
hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum were dissected free
hand from remaining tissue. all brain regions were frozen on dry
ice and stored at )70c until time of analysis. the hippocampus
and striatum were chosen based on their extensive serotonergic
innervation and their vulnerability to mdma-induced serotonergic deﬁcits (o’hearn et al. 1988; green et al. 2003). similarly
the parietal cortex, though less extensively innervated than the
frontal cortex, shows a greater mdma-induced loss of 5-htimmunoreactive ﬁbers than the frontal cortex (o’hearn et al.
1988). in addition, the occipital cortex and cerebellum were
selected for analysis of regional sert levels as discussed in
experiment 1. in experiment 2, on the day of killing, all animals
were anesthetized and decapitated as described. whole brains
were removed and immediately frozen in 2-methyl-butane
previously cooled in powdered dry ice. frozen brains were then
stored at )70c until the day of processing.

mdma effects on sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 expression | 953

methamphetamine administration
the  xxxg2099xxx -2 immunoblotting procedures in experiment 1 were
validated, in part, by means of meth lesioning of striatal dopamine
(da) terminals. adult rats (n = 5 per group) were administered s.c.
injections of either (±)-meth hcl (4 · 10 mg/kg, 2-h interdose
interval) or 0.9% saline vehicle. one week after the treatment, all
animals were killed and striatal samples were obtained for later
analysis.
administration of mdma and n-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2bromobenzylamine
in both experiments, young adult male rats (pd 72) were subjected
to an mdma binge dosing paradigm previously used in our
laboratory (piper et al. 2006) and similar to that reported in many
other studies of mdma neurotoxicity (green et al. 2003). the
dosing regimen consisted of four s.c. injections of 10 mg/kg (±)mdma hcl in 0.9% nacl, with an interdose interval of 1 h.
control animals received the same regimen of saline vehicle only
(n = 10 per group in experiment 2). rectal temperatures during
mdma dosing were monitored as described in piper et al. (2005).
in experiment 1, we used the selective noradrenergic neurotoxin
dsp-4 to lesion ascending noradrenergic projections from the locus
coeruleus (fritschy et al. 1990) prior to mdma administration.
rats in this experiment were given i.p. injections of either 100 mg/
kg dsp-4 or saline 1 week prior to either the binge dose of mdma
or saline, thus forming four groups: saline/saline (n = 8), dsp-4/
saline (n = 6), saline/mdma (n = 8), and dsp-4/mdma (n = 6).
in both experiments, animals were killed 2 weeks following mdma
treatment for analysis. the same post-drug period has been used in
many previous studies to document signiﬁcant decrements in
serotonergic axon and terminal markers (green et al. 2003).
serotonin transporter binding
serotonin transporter binding analysis was performed as described
in piper et al. (2005). brieﬂy, washed membrane preparations were
assayed in triplicate using a 1.0 nm concentration of [3h]citalopram
(84.2 ci/mmol; perkinelmer, waltham, ma, usa). non-speciﬁc
binding was determined in parallel incubations containing 10 lm
unlabeled ﬂuoxetine. protein levels in each sample were determined
by means of the bio-rad dc protein assay (hercules, ca, usa)
using bovine gamma globulin as the standard.
norepinephrine transporter binding
norepinephrine (ne) transporter (net) binding was conducted as
described by tejani-butt (1992), with minor modiﬁcations. samples
were weighed and homogenized with a polytron in 30 vols of ice-cold
assay buffer containing 50 mm tris, 120 mm nacl, and 5 mm kcl,
ph 7.4. homogenates were then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min at
4c and resuspended, followed by three additional homogenizations
and washes. membrane preparations were ﬁnally homogenized in icecold buffer containing 50 mm tris, 300 mm nacl, and 5 mm kcl,
ph 7.4, as the increased concentration of nacl enhances binding of
nisoxetine to net (tejani-butt 1992). the binding reaction was
carried out by incubating the washed membranes in triplicate with
2.0 nm [3h]nisoxetine (87.2 ci/mmol; perkinelmer) for 4 h at 4c.
non-speciﬁc binding was deﬁned using 10 lm desipramine. the
reaction was terminated by addition of 5 ml ice-cold buffer and
ﬁltration through gf/b ﬁlters presoaked in 0.05% polyethyleneimine.

filters were washed twice more with buffer and then counted in a
packard 1900ca liquid scintillation analyzer (perkinelmer). the
protein concentration of each sample was determined as described in
the section on serotonin transporter binding.
preparation of whole-cell lysates/protein extraction for
immunoblotting
tissue preparation conformed to the basic methodology of wang
et al. (2004, 2005) with minor modiﬁcations. frozen tissues were
weighed and homogenized using a teﬂon-glass motorized pestle in
30 vols of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, ph 7.4,
containing 0.05 m tris, 1% igepal ca-630, 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (sds), 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 1 mm sodium ovanadate, and 1% of a commercially available protease inhibitor
cocktail (p8340; sigma chemical company). the use of a
detergent-containing lysis buffer allowed solubilization of all
membrane-bound (both plasmalemmal and endosomal) proteins
for subsequent analysis. following homogenization, samples were
agitated on a rocker for 30 min at 4c, and then centrifuged at the
same temperature for 15 min at 22 000 g. the resulting supernatant
was collected and frozen at )70c for subsequent polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (page) under denaturing conditions (sds–
page). protein concentration of samples was determined as
described in the section on serotonin transporter binding.
preparation of synaptosomes/protein extraction for
immunoblotting
frozen tissues were weighed and homogenized in 30 vols of icecold 0.32 m sucrose using a teﬂon-glass motorized pestle as before.
although it is preferable to use fresh tissue when preparing
synaptosomes for metabolic studies, frozen samples can readily be
used for synaptosomal preparations when the goal is to determine
protein expression in the sample (e.g. see eravci et al. 2008; hallett
et al. 2008). the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g to remove
nuclei and cellular debris, and the resulting supernatant was then
centrifuged at 16 000 g to yield a crude synaptosomal fraction.
synaptosomes were resuspended and homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (30 vols for striatal samples and 5 vols
for hippocampal samples) to solubilize the synaptosomal membrane-bound proteins as mentioned in the section on preparation of
whole-cell lysates/protein extraction for immunoblotting. after a
ﬁnal centrifugation at 22 000 g, the resulting supernatant was
collected and frozen at )70c for later sds–page.
immunoblotting
on the day of analysis, loading buffer (thermo scientiﬁc, waltham,
ma, usa) was added to a volume of sample calculated to contain
30–60 lg of protein, and the resulting mixture was boiled for 5 min
using a dry bath. molecular weight ladders (magicmark) were
prepared according to manufacturer’s recommendations (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa). all samples were run on 10% precast
polyacrylamide gels (pierce, rockford, il, usa) at 100 v for
60 min. proteins were electrotransferred at 100 v onto immobilon polyvinylidine diﬂuoride membranes (millipore, billerica,
ma, usa) for 80 min at 4c. following transfer, polyvinylidine
diﬂuoride membranes were washed in tris-buffered saline (tbs) for
10 min and blocked in 5% non-fat milk buffer in tbs for 1 h at
22c. membranes were then probed with primary antibodies against

sert or  xxxg2099xxx -2 overnight at 4c, with the exception of
membranes containing striatal protein, which were incubated with
 xxxg2099xxx -2 antibody for 1 h at 22c. membranes were rinsed twice
with tbs containing 0.2% tween 20 (tbs-t), and then washed in
tbs-t for 10 min followed by three 5-min washes. membranes
were then incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with
horseradish peroxidase at 22c for 2 h, washed for 10 min followed
by three 5-min washes in tbs-t, and ﬁnally immersed in enhanced
chemiluminescent reagent (ecl-plus; amersham biosciences,
piscataway, nj, usa) for 1 min. the resulting chemiluminescent
reaction was exposed on hyperﬁlm ecl (ge healthcare, piscataway, nj, usa), after which membranes were stripped and reprobed
with an antibody against b-actin to verify equal protein loading. as
an additional control, an identical ‘standard sample’ was run on all
gels to normalize variability in band density across blots in
subsequent analyses. protein bands were quantiﬁed using scion
image densitometry software (scion corporation, frederick, md,
usa), and the optical density of bands was expressed as percent of
control.
dorsal/median raphe tissue punches for real-time pcr
whole brains were cut coronally using a cryostat set at )10c.
approaching the midbrain, the anterior boundaries of the dorsal and
median raphe (same plane) were identiﬁed using the following two
landmarks: (i) complete lateralization of the hippocampus concomitant with (ii) rapid enlargement of the cerebral aqueduct (paxinos
and watson 1998). a 1-mm section encompassing the entire rostralcaudal extent of both nuclei was then taken and placed on an ionized
glass slide (thermo electron corporation, waltham, ma, usa).
the slide was chilled on dry ice for 1 min, after which punches of
both nuclei were taken using a sterile needle/expeller with an
internal diameter of 1 mm. tissue punches from each animal were
pooled and stored at )70c until rna extraction.
rna extraction and real-time pcr analysis
total rna was extracted from combined dorsal/median raphe
punches using an rneasy micro kit (qiagen, germantown, md,
usa). brieﬂy, punches were disrupted and homogenized in qiazol
reagent, after which chloroform was added, the samples were
centrifuged at 12 000 g, and the clear, upper phase containing total
rna was carefully collected. samples were then mixed with 70%
ethanol and loaded onto microcentrifuge columns. before ﬁnal rna
extraction using rnase-free water, columns were subject to multiple
washes using proprietary buffers, dnase i treatment, and at least two
additional washes in 80% ethanol. the rna eluate was analyzed for
purity (260od/280od ratio of 1.9–2.1 in conjunction with curve
analysis of 220od ﬁ 320od scan) and concentration using a nd1000 nanodrop spectrophotometer (thermo scientiﬁc). extracted
rna was diluted in rnase-free water as needed and stored at )70c
until real-time pcr analysis.
quantitative, real-time pcr was performed using a one-step rtpcr quantitect kit from qiagen, with sybr green as the
amplicon ﬂuorescence marker. brieﬂy, template rna (10 ng/
reaction) was added to a master mix containing random primers (rt
step), sensiscript and omniscript (rt step), and for the
ampliﬁcation step, gene-speciﬁc forward and reverse primers
(quantitect primer assays, qiagen; sequences are proprietary),
hot-start taq polymerase (qiagen), deoxynucleotidetriphosphates

(dntps), and magnesium buffer. all thermocycling steps, as well as
detection of sybr green ﬂuorescence intensity, were performed in
triplicate on an mx3000p pcr instrument (stratagene, la jolla,
ca, usa). relative mrna abundance between treatment groups
was calculated by means of the 2)ddct method (livak and
schmittgen 2001), using the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase to normalize rna loading in each
reaction. all data are expressed as fold-difference in gene
expression.
statistical analysis
for validation of sert westerns (experiment 1), pearson’s product–
moment correlation analysis was used to determine correspondence
between immunoblot and radioligand binding analyses of regional
sert. all statistical comparisons between saline and mdma
groups in experiments 1 and 2 were performed by means of
student’s t-tests. in experiment 2, one outlier in the saline/sert
group was detected using the extreme studentized deviation
(grubb’s) method and was removed from all subsequent analyses.
a value of p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance.

results
validation experiments: control procedures validated our
immunoblotting methods for analyzing sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2
protein expression
as described in xie et al. (2006), it is crucial when using
immunoblotting to validate the choice of band(s) selected for
measurement to ensure that it corresponds to the authentic
protein of interest. in this study, we performed a series of
validation procedures for both sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 using
tissue sources known to have differing amounts of either
protein. for sert validation, we included tissue from sertko mice (no sert), tissue from rats treated with the 5-ht
neurotoxin 5,7-dht (low sert), and tissues from various
brain regions heterogeneous for sert expression (e.g. cortex
vs. cerebellum; kish et al. 2005). we also determined the
correlation between regional sert levels assessed by
radioligand binding and sert assessed by immunoblotting
using the band selected according to the preceding criteria.
upon testing a panel of commercially available antibodies,
only calbiochem pc177l anti-sert proved satisfactory in
our hands (see table s1). using this antibody, we conﬁrmed
the identity of an authentic sert band near the predicted
molecular weight of the protein of 76 kda (qian et al.
1995) based on the protein band patterns from whole-tissue
lysates derived from sert-ko mice (fig.  xxxd3227xxx ), 5,7-dht
treated rats (fig.  xxxd3227xxx ), and regional brain expression in
normal rats (fig. s1b). in some blots, the sert band
resolved into a doublet, which may represent different
phosphorylation states of the protein (jayanthi et al. 2005).
additionally, we found a signiﬁcant correlation between
sert binding and sert immunoblotting in their respective
measurement of regional levels of the protein (fig. s1c and d).

sal/sal].

(c)

for the validation of our  xxxg2099xxx -2 immunoblots, we
analyzed striatal tissue from animals treated with a neurotoxic regimen of meth, a substance known to damage
nigrostriatal dopaminergic projections and thus leading to
signiﬁcant loss of  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein expression in this region
(kita et al. 2003). analysis of synaptosomal  xxxg2099xxx -2 levels
in the striatum 1 week following a meth binge conﬁrmed
the identity of a single protein band corresponding to the
transporter (70 kda) (fig. s1e). the established sert and
 xxxg2099xxx -2 protein bands were selected for quantiﬁcation in all
subsequent analyses.

experiment 1: mdma reduced synaptosomal sert but not
 xxxg2099xxx -2 protein expression
we reasoned that if high doses of mdma cause degeneration
of distal serotonergic axons and nerve terminals as suggested
by the well-established loss of sert binding as well as
sert-immunoreactive ﬁber staining, then a vesicular marker
such as  xxxg2099xxx -2 should also be signiﬁcantly decreased in
mdma-treated animals. the limitation of this approach is
that  xxxg2099xxx -2 is expressed not only by serotonergic neurons
but also by neurons that use da and ne as their
neurotransmitter. therefore, to develop a preparation in
which  xxxg2099xxx -2 expression is limited mainly to serotonergic
sources, we focused on the hippocampus because (i) this
structure is only sparsely innervated by dopaminergic
afferents (see discussion) and (ii) ascending noradrenergic
ﬁbers can be selectively lesioned with the compound dsp-4
(fritschy et al. 1990).
one week following dsp-4 (or saline) pre-treatment,
animals were given either an mdma binge or saline, after
which they were killed 2 weeks later for analysis. during the
mdma binge, all mdma-treated animals experienced
hyperthermia compared with the saline-treated controls
(fig. 1a), which was not signiﬁcantly affected by dsp-4
pre-treatment (fig. 1c). the efﬁcacy of dsp-4 in lesioning
the noradrenergic innervation of the hippocampus was
conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcant reduction in net binding (61–
65%) in the dsp-4- pre-treated groups compared with their
respective saline controls (fig. 2). immunoblotting revealed
that hippocampal levels of synaptosomal  xxxg2099xxx -2 remained
relatively unchanged in the dsp-4/mdma group (fig. 3a
and b) compared with the dsp-4/saline controls, despite a
large reduction in regional sert levels in all groups given
mdma (fig. 4a and b).
experiment 2: mdma produced a striking reduction in
raphe sert gene expression with a lesser effect on  xxxg2099xxx -2
to examine the possible role of altered gene expression in
mdma-related effects on sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein levels,

campus (piñeyro and blier 1999). importantly, these nuclei
contain very few other monoaminergic neurons with the
exception of a small population of da-containing cells
(descarries et al. 1986), thus ensuring that  xxxg2099xxx -2 gene
expression in the tissue punches would almost exclusively
reﬂect activity in serotonergic neurons (piñeyro and blier
1999; vertesa and linley 2007). during treatment, animals
given mdma again experienced signiﬁcant elevations in
body temperature compared with saline-treated controls

animals in the mdma group exhibited a tremendous
reduction (50-fold) in sert transcript levels with a smaller
(10-fold) but still signiﬁcant reduction in  xxxg2099xxx -2 compared with saline-treated controls (fig. 5).

discussion
in this study, we examined the inﬂuence of mdma on two
different markers of 5-ht ﬁbers and terminals to test the
possibility that drug-induced serotonergic deﬁcits may result
from reduced cellular expression rather than neurodegeneration. to that end, we compared relative changes in the
protein (experiment 1) and transcript (experiment 2) levels
of sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 at 2 weeks following a binge regimen
of mdma. given the sparse da innervation of the
hippocampus (ciliax et al. 1995; kitahama et al. 2007),
experiment 1 aimed to limit  xxxg2099xxx -2 expression in this area

we measured transcript levels of both markers 2 weeks
following an mdma binge. real-time pcr methods were
used to quantify sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 mrna in combined
dorsal and median raphe nuclei, both of which contain
serotonergic perikarya that project extensively to the hippo-

mainly to serotonergic sources by initially lesioning ne input
with the known noradrenergic neurotoxin dsp-4 (jaimetcheverry and zieher 1980). in the hippocampus of dsp-4/
mdma-treated animals, immunoblot analysis revealed only
a small, non-signiﬁcant effect of mdma on  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein
expression compared with the expression seen in dsp-4/
saline controls. in contrast, levels of sert were substantially
reduced in all mdma-treated groups, suggesting that
mdma may reduce the amount of sert protein without
inducing terminal loss. in experiment 2, we explored the
contribution of altered gene expression to mdma-induced
changes in the levels of sert and  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein by
measuring transcript levels of both markers in combined
dorsal/median raphe punches 2 weeks following mdma or
saline administration. gene expression of both proteins was
severely reduced by mdma treatment, again raising the
possibility that this compound may regulate markers of
serotonergic neurons without inducing distal axotomy.
3,4- xxxd2611xxx  is a substrate for
 xxxg2099xxx -2 (partilla et al. 2006), and administration of mdma
to rats transiently reduces vesicular da uptake and [3h]dihydrotetrabenazine binding to  xxxg2099xxx -2 in the striatum
(where the large majority of this protein is found in da
nerve terminals) (hansen et al. 2002). the da system has
also been the focus of research using  xxxg2099xxx -2 as a marker
for nerve terminal integrity. for example, postmortem studies
have revealed signiﬁcant reductions in both  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein
expression and  xxxg2099xxx -2-immunoreactive ﬁber density in the
caudate and putamen of parkinson’s disease patients compared with age-matched controls (miller et al. 1999).
furthermore, the extent of these depletions was shown to
parallel reductions in the levels of the  xxxg2149xxx  in the
same regions, another measure of da-terminal integrity
(miller et al. 1997). non-human primates treated with the
selective nigrostriatal da neurotoxin mptp have shown
similar decreases in both  xxxg2099xxx -2 and  xxxg2149xxx 
(miller et al. 1999). interestingly, reveron et al. (2005)
found long-lasting reductions in striatal  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein
expression in 10-week-old mice given an mdma binge,
which is consistent with the well-known da neurotoxicity of
mdma in mice compared with rats. ricaurte et al. (2000)
also reported 35–40% decreases in [3h]dihydrotetrabenazine
binding in the caudate and putamen 2 weeks following
repeated mdma administration to baboons, and even larger
effects were observed in the frontal cortex. as non-human
primates, like rats, display mainly serotonergic neurotoxicity
to mdma, the authors interpreted their results as a sign of 5ht terminal loss in those brain areas. on the other hand,
there is reason to question the baboon ﬁndings on the basis
that even a total serotonergic denervation of the caudate and
putamen seems unlikely to produce 35–40% reductions in
 xxxg2099xxx -2 because of the much greater dopaminergic compared with serotonergic innervation of those structures. more
importantly, the present results showed little change in

 xxxg2099xxx -2 protein expression under conditions that attempted
to maximize the serotonergic contributions to the overall
 xxxg2099xxx -2 synaptosomal content (particularly in the hippocampus). we considered the possibility that hippocampal
 xxxg2099xxx -2 in the dsp-4/mdma group might be relatively
preserved even in the face of a partial axotomy if the
serotonergic neurons compensatorily up-regulated  xxxg2099xxx -2
gene expression and vesicle recycling to enhance 5-ht
sequestration in the remaining terminals. such a scenario
could potentially have normalized the  xxxg2099xxx -2 signal in our
immunoblots. however, the opposite ﬁnding, namely a
signiﬁcant decrease in  xxxg2099xxx -2 gene expression, argues
against this interpretation.
several studies have recently investigated the effects of
mdma administration on sert protein expression in
various forebrain regions as determined by immunoblotting.
the results have been mixed, with two studies ﬁnding
reduced sert expression (bhide et al. 2009; xie et al.
2006) but others reporting no effect (de silva et al. 2005;
wang et al. 2004, 2005). given the ample evidence for
mdma-induced sert reductions measured either by
radioligand binding (reviewed by green et al. 2003) or
immunohistochemistry (xie et al. 2006), we suggest that the
above mentioned negative results are most likely because of
a lack of adequate validation of the antibodies used in the
immunoblotting procedures (see supplementary table s1).
importantly, the decrease in synaptosomal sert immunoreactivity found in this study was accompanied by only a minor
decrease in  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein levels, suggesting that mdmainduced reductions in sert may be related to a downregulation phenomenon and not necessarily dependent on
neurodegeneration.
additional evidence against a neurodegenerative effect of
mdma is supported by research showing a failure of
mdma to provoke glial responses thought to occur in
reaction to neural damage. importantly, several studies
(o’callaghan and miller 1993; pubill et al. 2003; wang
et al. 2004, 2005) found no mdma-induced increases in
glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap), an astroglial marker
that is elevated following treatment with meth, mptp, 5,7dht, and other recognized neurotoxins (o’callaghan and
miller 1993). another measure of astrogliosis, the expression
of heat-shock protein 27, followed the same trend. finally,
mdma similarly failed to produce evidence for microglial
activation as measured by ox-6 immunoreactivity or
[3h]pk-11195 binding to the peripheral benzodiazepine
receptor (pubill et al. 2003). it should be noted, however,
that at least two studies have documented increases in gfap
expression in the hippocampus (but not other brain regions)
following mdma treatment, suggesting that this region may
be particularly vulnerable to mdma-induced neural damage
(aguirre et al. 1999; adori et al. 2006). another study
showed post-mdma increases in gfap immunoreactivity in
the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum in response to a

very high dose (40 mg/kg) of the drug administered i.p.
(sharma and ali 2008). given these latter ﬁndings, it would
be of interest for future studies to investigate whether
mdma affects glial responses in the context of our present
effort as an absence of mdma-induced gliosis would further
support our contention that this compound reduces sert
expression in the absence of terminal loss. on the other hand,
if such responses were indeed evidenced, it would be critical
to assess the neurochemical phenotype of the affected
terminals as this would clarify whether glial reactivity
following mdma was occurring in response to serotonergic
or non-serotonergic damage.
despite much focus on the neurochemical effects of
mdma on serotonergic neurons, little research exists
investigating changes in the gene expression of 5-ht
neuronal markers following exposure to this compound.
regarding the effects of mdma on sert gene expression,
in situ hybridization studies found decreases in sert gene
expression 2 weeks (kirilly et al. 2008) and up to several
months following mdma (li et al. 2006). this study is the
ﬁrst to quantify mdma-related changes in midbrain raphe
sert gene expression by qrt-pcr, an approach that
permits more precise quantiﬁcation than in situ hybridization.
it is noteworthy that despite an average 50-fold reduction in
sert gene expression 2 weeks after an mdma binge,
similarly treated animals exhibited only a 50% reduction in
synaptosomal sert protein levels. this apparent disconnect
has previously been documented for this protein (rattray
et al. 1996), and may reﬂect post-treatment increases in
sert mrna translation efﬁciency, alterations in posttranslational modiﬁcation of sert, or inherently slow
turnover rates of the sert protein. likewise, these possibilities may also in part explain our ﬁnding of only marginal
decreases in  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein levels despite a 10-fold
reduction in  xxxg2099xxx -2 gene expression in mdma-treated
animals. future studies should aim to determine the effects of
mdma on the molecular machinery governing production
of proteins used to identify monoaminergic and other neural
subtypes.
importantly, our interpretation of the results of experiment 1 relies, in part, on the success of dsp-4 lesioning of
hippocampal ne ﬁbers. as documented by jaim-etcheverry
and zieher (1980) and fritschy and grzanna (1992), dsp-4
is an  xxxd3249xxx  that targets net as well as structures
within ne terminals, presumably causing a pruning of locus
coeruleus afferents throughout the brain that peaks at 2–
4 weeks following administration. interestingly, the notion
that dsp-4 induces neurodegeneration of ne ﬁbers is based
on indirect measures similar to those typically used to
assess mdma neurotoxicity. such measures include severe
depletions in ne, inhibition of radiolabeled ne uptake
in vivo, and most convincingly, long-lasting reductions in
da b-hydroxylase immunoreactivity (landa et al. 1984;
fritschy et al. 1990). using net as an alternative marker

for ne axons and terminals, we achieved a signiﬁcant
reduction in hippocampal levels of this protein following
dsp-4 pre-treatment, implying success in lesioning ne
input to this region. however, as is the case with sert and
da b-hydroxylase, net is yet another marker liable to
regulation, bringing into question the validity of considering
reductions in these proteins as evidence for neurodegeneration (see booze et al. 1988). notably, we found no change
in regional  xxxg2099xxx -2 expression in the dsp-4/saline group,
despite the fact that this protein is abundant in noradrenergic ﬁbers. given the presence of signiﬁcant numbers of
da and 5-ht nerve terminals in the striatum and parietal
cortex, respectively (reader et al. 1989; kabani et al.
1990), the relative contribution of  xxxg2099xxx -2 from noradrenergic sources in those regions may have been insufﬁcient to
allow detection of loss following dsp-4 treatment. however, this explanation is less clear for the hippocampus, as
the number of noradrenergic and serotonergic varicosities
bearing  xxxg2099xxx -2 may be similar (oleskevich et al. 1989;
oleskevich and descarries1990) (though this has never
been directly examined). consequently, we cannot exclude
the possibility that a failure of dsp-4 to produce noradrenergic terminal degeneration in the hippocampus contributed to our inability to ﬁnd an effect of mdma on vmat2 protein expression. however, even if dsp-4 failed to
lesion ne ﬁbers in the hippocampus, it is important to point
out that  xxxg2099xxx -2 levels were almost completely unchanged
in the sal/mdma group, where modest reductions (30%
assuming equal 5-ht : ne contribution to overall  xxxg2099xxx -2
content) would have been expected if serotonergic terminals
were damaged by an order of magnitude relative to the
extent of sert depletions in this region (60%). in further
support of this argument, we have recently found a lack of
effect of mdma on tph protein expression (another
marker of 5-ht terminals) in synaptosomes when measured
by validated immunoblotting (manuscript in preparation).
together, these ﬁndings reinforce the notion that the
majority of serotonergic nerve terminals may indeed be
spared following mdma exposure, though additional
experiments are necessary to conﬁrm our ﬁndings by use
of more direct measures not dependent on marker staining.
such experiments should investigate ways to directly
highlight and subsequently measure changes in 5-ht ﬁber
density in response to mdma, such as through the use of
anterograde or retrograde tracers, or by using reporter genes
(e.g. green ﬂuorescent protein) driven by 5-ht neuronspeciﬁc promoters. lastly, it bears mention that dsp-4 is a
commonly used tool in neuropharmacology research, and
thus future studies should more carefully address the
neurotoxic capacity of this compound. this will enable
greater conﬁdence in use of dsp-4 to lesion ne ﬁbers in
other studies, as well as potentially clarify the nature of
mdma effects on serotonergic neurons in the context of
the present ﬁndings.

despite many years of intensive research, the exact
nature of mdma neurotoxicity remains controversial.
substantial evidence has been offered both for (molliver
et al. 1990; ricaurte et al. 2000; green et al. 2003) and
against (o’callaghan and miller 1993; pubill et al. 2003;
baumann et al. 2007; wang et al. 2007) the neurodegeneration hypothesis. wang et al. (2007) have proposed three
possible models of mdma neurotoxicity: (i) neurodegeneration, (ii) neuroadaptation, and (iii) a mixed model
involving both kinds of changes (i.e. signiﬁcant loss of
serotonergic nerve terminals along with adaptive changes in
the functioning of the remaining terminals). the present
results demonstrating a profound down-regulation of sert
gene expression accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction in
expression of the  xxxg2099xxx -2 gene certainly conﬁrms that the
serotonergic neurons of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei
undergo major adaptive changes following a high-dose
mdma treatment regimen. moreover, even with the
caveats expressed earlier, the lack of a signiﬁcant decrease
in synaptosomal  xxxg2099xxx -2 protein expression suggests at the
very least that mdma does not produce a massive loss of
serotonergic nerve terminals. therefore, our ﬁndings are
consistent either with the neuroadaptation or mixed model
of wang et al. (2007), as we cannot exclude the possibility
of a partial degenerative response in the mdma-treated
animals.
finally, a general implication of our ﬁndings is that druginduced depletions in protein markers liable to regulation
may not necessarily reﬂect neurodegeneration. other factors,
such as changes in gene expression of these proteins, must be
addressed to determine the nature of adverse effects of any
purported neurotoxin.
