summary
rapid, nongenomic actions of glucocorticoids (gcs) have
been well documented, but information about putative
membrane receptors that mediate them is scarce. we used
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to search for
membrane gc-binding on the mouse pituitary cell line
att-20. a slowly diffusing fraction (tau3; diffusion constant
3⫻10–10 cm2 s–1) of fluorescein-labeled dexamethasone on
the cell membrane corresponds to fluoresceindexamethasone binding. preincubation experiments were
performed to test binding specificity: a 500-fold excess of
unlabeled
dexamethasone
abolished
subsequent
fluorescein-dexamethasone membrane binding from 58±2
(control) to 8±1 (% of tau3, mean ± s.e.m.), the natural ligand
corticosterone prevented it partially (29±2), while the sex
steroids estradiol (56±4) and progesterone (50±4) and the
gc-receptor antagonist ru486 (56±2) had no effect.

preincubation with pertussis toxin resulted in
disappearance of the slowest diffusion component (11±4)
suggesting association of the receptor with a g-protein.
varying the concentration of fluorescein-dexamethasone
showed that membrane binding is highly cooperative with
an apparent kd of 180 nm and bmax of 230 nm. taken
together, these results demonstrate high-affinity gcbinding on the cell membrane of att-20 cells with
characteristics distinct from intracellular binding.

introduction
during the last decade, rapid steroid effects, i.e. effects
occurring on a timescale of seconds to minutes, have been
recognized as physiologically relevant and widespread through
all classes of steroid hormones (norman et al., 2004; losel and
wehling, 2003). these effects cannot be explained by
interaction with the well-characterized intracellular steroid
receptors acting as ligand-activated transcription factors (losel
et al., 2003). steroids have repeatedly been shown to act
independently of gene transcription (nongenomically) on
several pathways that are typically used by membrane
receptors, such as the activation of phosphoinosite 3-kinase
( xxxg1743xxx  kinase) (simoncini et al., 2000) or protein kinase c (pkc)
(winter et al., 2004); they mediate vasorelaxation, cell lysis
and insulin release, and inhibit apoptosis [losel and wehling
(losel and wehling, 2003) and the references therein]. for
membrane steroid receptors by contrast, relatively few data are
available. in some instances the ‘classical’ intracellular steroid
receptors can somehow be attached to the cell membrane and
are then able to elicit rapid steroid responses. so is the estrogen
receptor alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) translocated to the plasma membrane upon
stimulation with estradiol to form a protein complex together
with shc and the  xxxg1145xxx  (kousteni et al., 2003; song
et al., 2004). recently, it has been shown that the dna-binding

domain of  xxxg730xxx  is responsible for the interaction of the receptor
with  xxxg1743xxx  kinase (chambliss et al., 2004).
additionally, a distinct class of membrane steroid receptors,
unrelated to their intracellular counterparts, exist: the first
unique vertebrate membrane steroid receptor, a progestin
receptor that belongs to a new family of g-protein-coupled
receptors, has been cloned and characterized recently (zhu et
al., 2003a; zhu et al., 2003b).
glucocorticoids (gcs) are, like cortisol or corticosterone
(the main glucocorticoids of humans and rodents,
respectively), a class of steroid hormones produced in the
adrenal gland upon stimulation by the pituitary hormone
 xxxg1801xxx  (acth). they are of vital importance in
stress- and immune reactions as well as for metabolism, and
affect virtually every cell in the body. gc blood levels are thus
tightly regulated. by means of a feedback mechanism, gcs
inhibit acth synthesis (muglia et al., 2000) and release (hinz
and hirschelmann, 2000; antoni et al., 1992; loechner et al.,
1999). this latter effect occurs in vivo on a timescale of
minutes (hinz and hirschelmann, 2000) and can be considered
a physiological, nongenomic steroid effect.
the acth-producing mouse pituitary cell line att-20 is
used as a model system for the fast-feedback inhibition of
acth-release by gcs (antoni et al., 1992; loechner et al.,

1999). dexamethasone, a potent synthetic gc, inhibits acthrelease in this cell line in less than 10 minutes (loechner et al.,
1999). the existence of a membrane  xxxg1601xxx 
(mgr) was suggested as the result of binding studies of
isolated att-20 cell membranes with radiolabeled ligands
(harrison et al., 1979; spindler et al., 1991), and confocal
microscopy with antibodies directed against the intracellular
 xxxg1601xxx  (igr) on lymphoma cells (gametchu,
1987) and blood leukocytes (bartholome et al., 2004). to our
knowledge, data on affinity and binding characteristics of these
membrane gc-binding sites have, until now, never been
published.
the aim of our study was to find specific binding of a gc
ligand to the cell membrane of living att-20 cells. we decided
to use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs) (magde et
al., 1972; maiti et al., 1997) for this purpose. fcs
measurements are non-invasive and can be carried out under
equilibrium conditions in aqueous solution. fluctuations in
signal-intensity are recorded when fluorescence-labeled
molecules diffuse through the excitation volume, and are
quantified by autocorrelation analysis. thus, faster and slower
diffusion times can be assigned to unbound and bound ligand
states, respectively. fcs has been used to investigate bacterial
motor proteins (cluzel et al., 2000), p53 latency (yakovleva et
al., 2001), active transport in plastid tubules (köhler et al.,
2000), amyloid-beta-protein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid
(pitschke et al., 1998) and ultrasensitive pathogen detection
(oehlenschlager et al., 1996; korn et al., 2003), and to study
diffusion behavior of and ligand binding to membrane
receptors on single cells (briddon et al., 2004; patel et al.,
2002; rigler et al., 1999; zhong et al., 2001; pramanik et al.,
2001; pick et al., 2003; licht et al., 2003; schwille et al.,
1999a; schwille et al., 1999b).
in the case of studying gc membrane-binding, a possible
interference of ligand, binding to the igr, had to be excluded
when measuring on whole cells. in a preliminary
methodological study we used a ‘scanning’ procedure through
the cell to measure membrane-binding as opposed to
intracellular diffusion and/or binding of fluorescein-labeled
dexamethasone (f-dexa) and found a characteristic, slowly
diffusing component that was present exclusively on the cell
membrane (maier et al., 2002). based on this model, the data
presented here demonstrate specific and high-affinity binding
of f-dexa on the membrane of att-20 cells.
materials and methods
materials
att-20 cells (ccl-89) were purchased from the american type
culture collection (atcc, manassas, va). cell culture media and
reagents were from gibco brl (paisley, uk). f-dexa was obtained
from molecular probes (leiden, the netherlands). all other
chemicals were from sigma (st louis, mi). all steroids were
purchased in a water-soluble form (estradiol as glucuronide,
dexamethasone and corticosterone as cyclodextrin complex, and
progesterone as pure substance); stock solutions were prepared
directly in binding buffer. dexamethasone was also purchased as pure
substance, which was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to final
concentrations with binding buffer. mifepristone (ru486) was
dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and diluted to final
concentrations in binding buffer (less than 0.1% dmso). pertussis
toxin (ptx) was purchased from sigma (p-2980) as 0.2 mg/ml stock

solution and diluted to final concentrations with binding buffer.
labtek chambered coverglass (8 chambers) was from nalgenunc
(naperville, il).
cell culture
cells were maintained at 37°c, 6% co2, 95% relative humidity in 75
cm2 cell culture flasks in ham’s f10 medium (supplemented with
12.5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics). the
medium was changed twice weekly and cells were subcultured every
4 weeks. for the binding experiments only cells with a passage
number up to five were used.
incubation
cells were transferred to poly-d-lysine coated labtek chambered
coverglass on the day of experiments and allowed to attach for 1 hour
before washing them gently two times with phosphate buffered saline
and replacing the culture medium with non-fluorescent binding buffer
(containing 145 mm nacl, 4 mm kcl, 1 mm na2hpo4, 0.8 mm
cacl2, 25 mm hepes and 22 mm glucose). att-20 cells showed a
very low uncorrelated autofluorescence of approximately 0.3 khz.
the viability of the cells was >90% after 3 hours of incubation at room
temperature in the binding buffer (as assessed by trypan blue
staining). the time required for measurements did not exceed 1.5 h.
to generate the binding curve, f-dexa was added in varying
concentrations and cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37°c;
measurements were carried out immediately afterwards at 20°c. pure
f-dexa was used for the low-concentration range (up to 80 nm); for
the higher concentrations (240 and 540 nm) 80 nm f-dexa was mixed
with unlabeled dexamethasone. measurements using 100, 120, 140
and 160 nm were done with mixtures as well as with pure f-dexa
solutions. for each concentration five cells from at least two
independent incubation experiments were measured, and
measurements were taken in triplicates.
the specificity of f-dexa binding was tested in a 3-hour
preincubation
experiment,
with
the
unlabeled
steroids
dexamethasone, corticosterone, estradiol and progesterone at a 500fold excess (60 mum) at 37°c, followed by a 1-hour incubation with
120 nm f-dexa. for each steroid, at least eight cells from three
independent incubation experiments were measured in triplicates.
preincubation experiments with dexamethasone were done with both
cyclodextrin-complexed and pure substance, and since the effects did
not differ between the two groups, resulting data were pooled together.
preincubation with binding buffer alone was used as control in each
experiment.
preincubation with the gc-receptor antagonist ru486 (60 mum) and
ptx (1 mug/ml) were performed in the same way as described for the
specificity experiments; heat-inactivated ptx (1 mug/ml) served as
negative control for the latter experiments. for each substance, at least
seven cells from three independent experiments were measured in
triplicates.
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
fcs measurements were carried out on a confocor spectrofluorimeter
(carl zeiss-evotec, jena, germany) equipped with an ar-laser, a
water immersion objective (c-apochromat 63⫻/1.2 w korr), an
avalanche photodiode (spcm-cd 3017) and a hardware
autocorrelator (alv 5000, alv, langen, germany).
samples were excited with the 488-nm ar-laser-line attenuated by
optical density filters, the fluorescence signal was detected through a
dichroic mirror with bandpass filters. the pinhole diameter was set to
45 mum, resulting in a confocal volume element of 0.17 mum in the radial
and 2.4 mum in the axial dimension as determined by calibration using
rhodamine 6g.
the confocal volume was positioned in the cells using an x-y stage

gc-binding on the pituitary membrane
with 1 mum resolution, whereas the correct focus positioning on the
cell membrane was ascertained by a scanning procedure (maier et al.,
2002). briefly, the focus position was moved in 1-mum steps from
outside the cell across the cell membrane towards the glass surface
and measurements (15 seconds correlator scaling and 30 seconds
measurement) were taken at each position. measurements at the
membrane position (typically 7-9 mum from the coverglass) were taken
in triplicates and the correct positioning was re-evaluated at the end
of each measurement series.
the signal response of f-dexa in solution was determined to be
linear for up to 200 particles (corresponding to 1.6 mum f-dexa) in the
focus; a negative control of pure fluorescein-dye incubated with the
cells revealed unrestricted diffusion in all cellular compartments.

solution and component tau2 representing dio diffusion on the cell
membrane derived from the fitting procedure.
in total, 22 (27 for control) autocorrelation curves taken at the
membrane position from four individual cells were evaluated for each
experimental subgroup. statistical evaluation was performed using
spss 12.0 statistical software. diffusion times and percent fraction
of the slower diffusion component from the co, dexa and ptx
subgroups were compared by one-way anova followed by dunnett-test (two-sided, for comparison of either treatment group with co)
as post-hoc statistics, when appropriate. p<0.05 was set as level of
statistical significance. data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

data evaluation
a normalized autocorrelation function g(tau) describes fluctuations
with time around the mean measured intensity f, where angular
brackets represent the ensemble average:
g(tau) = 1 + 〈deltaf(t) · deltaf(t+tau)〉 / 〈f〉2 .
g(tau) depends on the measurement geometry and on the diffusion
properties of the fluorescent species. for a single diffusing species in
a gaussian confocal volume it has the following analytical form:

journal of cell science

g(tau) = 1 + 1 / [n(1+tau/taud) (1+tau/(z/r)2taud)0.5] ,
where n is the particle number and taud the characteristic diffusion time
for the fluorescent molecule moving through the confocal volume with
an axial (z) to radial (r) dimension. the confocal volume was
determined by measurements of the correlation time for the
fluorescent dye rhodamine 6g with the known diffusion coefficient
d of 2.8⫻10–6 cm2 s–1 employing the relationship d=r2/4taud.
experimental autocorrelation functions were evaluated using a two or
three component model including the triplet state with the triplet
fraction ft and the triplet lifetime taut. the analytical formula for the
two component model is given by:
1
g(tau) =

with

an analogous expression is valid for the three component model,
which according to preliminary work (maier et al., 2002) is adequate
to fit the data obtained from scanning whole cells. confocal volume
calibrations using rhodamine 6g were carried out on each
experimental day as described above and used as an input for the fits,
which yielded a diffusion time tau1 corresponding to free f-dexa in
solution and two further cell-related diffusion times tau2 and tau3 as well
as the corresponding relative amount of each component. the
software fcs access® (evotec) and origin® (microcal) was used for
nonlinear least squares fits.
probing of membrane fluidity
the lipophilic membrane marker 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine
perchlorate (dio) was from molecular probes. to label cells with dio
they were incubated with 10 mum dio (in binding buffer) for 20
minutes. after this time, dio was replaced with binding buffer
containing either 60 mum dexamethasone (dexa), 1 mug/ml ptx
(ptx) or binding buffer alone (control, co). cells were then
incubated for 1 hour before fcs measurements were performed.
autocorrelation curves were best fitted to the two-component model
with component tau1 corresponding to the diffusion time of dio in

affinity of f-dexa–binding
to determine the localization of f-dexa, att-20 cells were
scanned by moving the laser focus along the z-direction
through the cell. in fig. 1 a fluorescence intensity profile of a
z-scan (fig. 1a) is shown together with recorded fluorescence
fluctuations (fig. 1b) and corresponding autocorrelation
curves (fig. 1c) for three distinct focus positions. examination
of the brownian motion of free f-dexa in the buffer medium
above the cell surface showed a homogeneous distribution of
the intensity fluctuations. when the focus was positioned at the
upper cell membrane, an increase and broadening of the
fluctuation peaks was observed together with a large shift of
the autocorrelation function towards longer diffusion times.
these characteristics were significantly reduced when the
focus was positioned completely inside the cell. analysis of
the autocorrelation curves yielded consistently the following
three diffusion coefficients: d1=1.8⫻10–6 cm2 s–1, d2=2⫻10–8
cm2 s–1, and d3=3⫻10–10 cm2 s–1.
increasing the concentration of f-dexa in the buffer-medium
led to an increased proportion of the slowest component. in
fig. 2 the intensity fluctuation and autocorrelation curves are
displayed for low, medium and high concentrations of f-dexa.
increase and broadening of the fluctuation peaks corresponded

gc-binding on the pituitary membrane
isotherm over a suitably broad range of concentrations, it was
necessary to mix labeled with unlabeled dexamethasone in the
high concentration range (see materials and methods). in the
intermediate range (100-160 nm), measurements were
performed with pure f-dexa solutions as well as with mixtures
to exclude a possible bias caused by this procedure.
fig. 3a shows the average values of the relative statistical
weights s(tau3) of the slowly diffusing component (tau3) as a
function of the concentration of f-dexa on a logarithmic scale.
with the assumption that tau3 is the specific signature of the
membrane-bound ligand, s(tau3) can be equaled to the bound
fraction. fig. 3a can thus be read as a binding curve reflecting
the simultaneous presence of free and bound ligand; the
magnitude of the bound fraction necessarily decreases at high
ligand concentrations once the binding sites are saturated. the
molar concentrations of membrane-bound ligands were
calculated from the bound fraction s(tau3) and the f-dexa
concentrations, and are shown in fig. 3b for both the
individual measurements and for the average of measurements
for each particular concentration on a log scale. the average
data are shown in the insert of fig. 3b on a linear concentration
scale; this representation clearly demonstrates a sigmoidal
shape of the binding curve, which obviously cannot be fitted
by a hyperbolic function, suggesting cooperativity. evaluation
of the binding curve was performed by nonlinear fitting, based
on the hill equation with a variable slope (cantor and
schimmel, 1980) yielding a hill constant of 2.1±0.2, an
apparent kd value for the interacting sites of 180±10 nm and
a maximum concentration of bound ligand bmax of 230±10 nm;
the best fits are shown in fig. 3b and its insert. the data were

concave shape is again characteristic of positive cooperativity.
the transformed regression curve of fig. 3b may be used to

specificity of f-dexa–binding
the specificity of f-dexa–binding was assessed by
preincubation for 3 hours in 500-fold excess of unlabeled
dexamethasone, the natural ligand corticosterone, the sex
steroids estradiol (which does not bind to the igr) and
progesterone (which binds with low affinity to the igr),
followed by an 1-hour incubation with f-dexa. results are the
mean of at least eight cells from three independent
experiments.
representative intensity fluctuations and corresponding
autocorrelation curves for the various steroid hormones are
given in fig. 4. preincubation with unlabeled dexamethasone
reduced f-dexa membrane-binding from 58±2% (fraction of
membrane-bound f-dexa in the control, mean ± s.e.m.) to
8±1%. corticosterone, the natural ligand of the rodent gc
receptor, reduced subsequent f-dexa–binding to 29±2%,
whereas progesterone (50±4%) and estradiol (56±4%) were
unable to prevent f-dexa–binding on the cell membrane. an
overview of the results is given in fig. 5.

the possible interaction with a gi protein was assessed by
preincubation with ptx (1 mug/ml). after 3 hours of ptx
treatment, a subsequent incubation with f-dexa still led to
enrichment of f-dexa in the cell membrane, but the tau3
component was reduced to the same extent as in the
preincubation experiments with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled
dexamethasone (see above): 11±4 vs 58±2% (control). instead,
the tau2 component (the component which is normally seen
predominantly in the cytosol) showed a maximum on the
position of the cell membrane. by contrast, heat-inactivated
ptx was unable to alter subsequent f-dexa–binding (data not
shown).

effects on membrane fluidity
incorporation of dio in the cell membrane resulted in a
characteristic diffusion behavior at the membrane position
(supplementary material fig.  xxxd3227xxx ). autocorrelation curves

were best fitted with a two-component model, with the first (tau1)
component representing diffusion of free dio in solution and
the second (tau2) component diffusion of dio in the cell
membrane. a two component fit with tau1 fixed resulted in a
diffusion time of tau2=2.23±0.2⫻10–3 seconds (mean±s.e.m.)
corresponding to a diffusion constant of 3.7⫻10–8 cm2 s–1.
treatment with 60 mum dexa (the highest concentration used
in the competition experiments) or 1 mug/ml ptx did not have
any influence on the diffusion of dio on the cell membrane:
diffusion times were 2.10±0.1⫻10–3 seconds (dexa) and
1.78±0.2⫻10–3 seconds (ptx), respectively (p=0.2, one-way
anova).
the fraction of the tau2 component on the cell membrane was
significantly different between groups (p<0.0001, one-way
anova). dexa treatment led to a significant reduction of
the tau2 fraction (22.0±1.2%, dexa vs 33.5±1.2%, co;
p<0.0001, dunnet-t). by contrast, ptx did not change the tau2
fraction (36.9±1.7%, ptx vs 33.5±1.2%, co; p=0.15,
dunnet-t). representative autocorrelation curves together
with their two-component fits are shown in supplementary
material, fig. s1.
discussion
the data presented here show for the first time specific, highaffinity membrane-binding of a gc ligand to whole pituitary
cells. applying the highly sensitive fcs technique to the
mouse pituitary cell line att-20, we were able to discriminate
the diffusion behavior of f-dexa inside the cell, on the cell
membrane and outside the cell in solution. the small
measuring volume of fcs makes it possible to measure steroid
membrane-binding on whole cells without interference of
intracellular receptor-binding. moreover, fcs allows to study
ligand-binding without any manipulation of the cells. this is
particularly important when considering that most membrane
steroid-receptors seem to be very sensitive to changes of cellculture conditions when studied in vitro (watson et al., 2002).
another advantage is the possibility to directly discriminate,
by autocorrelation of the diffusion behavior of the
fluorescently-labeled ligand, between specific binding and

unspecific attachment to the cell membrane. thus, even a high
level of unspecific binding owing to the lipophilic nature of
steroid hormones does not hamper detection of specific binding
to the cell membrane, as would be the case when using
radioligands (watson and gametchu, 2001).
affinity data were obtained by incubation with different
concentrations of f-dexa that resulted in an average kd of 180
nm and a bmax of 230 nm, indicating a binding affinity
significantly lower than that of the igr, which was determined
using radioligands to be in the range of 5 nm or less (schaaf
and cidlowski, 2003 and the references therein). indeed, the
nongenomic gc effects described so far all occur at higher
concentrations than those necessary to saturate igr binding.
this also includes in vivo data, such as the vasorelaxing effect
of dexamethasone in mice where the plasma concentrations for
maximal effect were in the range of 100 nm (hafezimoghadam et al., 2002). gcs are used therapeutically in lifethreatening conditions such as status asthmaticus, severe
episodes of multiple sclerosis or systemic autoimmune
diseases, and leukaemia. initially, very high doses, resulting in
gc plasma concentrations of several 100 nm, are used that are
necessary for therapeutical effect. it has been postulated that at
very high concentrations, gcs might be able to alter physicochemical properties of cell membranes (the so-called
‘unspecific nongenomic effects’ of gcs) and thus inhibit cation
cycling across the cell membrane (buttgereit et al., 2000). the
highest concentration of dexamethasone used in this study, 60
mum, competed with dio for membrane incorporation but was
unable to alter membrane fluidity. it is therefore highly unlikely
that an unspecific nongenomic effect could cause the changes
in diffusion behavior of f-dexa observed in our work.
most remarkably, the binding curve that we were able to
obtain with fcs revealed positive cooperativity of the binding
process. thus, ligand binding to the membrane binding sites
enhances further binding. in other words, once a certain
threshold in the concentration of gcs is reached, small changes
in the gc concentration can elicit pronounced effects.
physiologically, gc plasma levels undergo diurnal variations,
and the body can react very precisely to sudden alterations of
cortisol (or corticosterone, for rodents) concentrations. it is not
known, which gc concentrations are reached locally at the
pituitary gland but – under the assumption that the membrane

3359

binding sites described here are related to the feedback
inhibition of acth release – a membrane receptor with
cooperative binding properties would be well suited to mediate
rapid adaptations of the system required in situations of acute
stress. basal regulation might be mediated by gc-inhibition of
acth synthesis via genomic pathways.
specificity of dexamethasone binding was shown by
preincubation experiments with various steroids. not only
unlabeled dexamethasone, but also the natural ligand
corticosterone were able to prevent subsequent fdexa–binding, whereas the sex steroids estradiol and
progesterone had no influence. thus, f-dexa binds to gcspecific binding sites on the cell membrane of the corticotrope
cell line att-20.
like the affinity of binding, the binding characteristics were
also clearly distinct from the igr. the igr antagonist ru486
was unable to prevent f-dexa membrane-binding, as was
progesterone, which is known to bind – albeit with low affinity
– to the igr (which is expressed in the att-20 cell line in high
abundance). distinct membrane binding sites – possibly related
to opioid-like receptors – have been found in the amphibian
brain (evans et al., 2000). by contrast, the mgr found on
lymphoma cells and peripheral blood leukocytes was detected
using an antibody against igr (gametchu, 1987; bartholome
et al., 2004), indicating structural resemblance of these binding
sites with the igr. with the data presented here, no direct
conclusion on the structure of the binding sites can be drawn,
because attachment to the cell membrane would certainly alter
the binding characteristics of the igr as well. however, it
seems reasonable that distinct binding characteristics should be
associated with distinct function.
another remarkable feature of the observed binding is the
small diffusion constant (3⫻10–10 cm2 s–1) obtained for the
bound ligand. measurements of ligand binding to cell
membranes typically result in diffusion constants that are one
order of magnitude higher (e.g. briddon et al., 2004; rigler et
al., 1999). possible interpretations of a smaller diffusion
constant are that the binding sites form huge clusters or,
alternatively, that they are not freely diffusing in the cell
membrane but are more closely attached to, e.g. the
cytoskeleton. this interpretation is supported by the fact that
preincubation with ptx abolished the tau3 component in the
autocorrelation function on the membrane position while fdexa enrichment was still apparent. pertussis toxin decouples
g-proteins from the receptor through adp ribosylation of the
 xxxg2224xxx  subunit. since f-dexa can still bind to the receptor (the
ligand is enriched in the cell membrane) it can be concluded
that upon g-protein decoupling also clustering and/or
cytoskeleton attachment of the receptor is disrupted. like
dexamethasone, ptx was unable to change membrane fluidity
at the concentration used in our experiments.
redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role
in acth-release (mains et al., 1999) and has also been shown
to be involved in rapid steroid effects. the steroid hormone
testosterone has been described to increase psa secretion from
a prostate cell line through binding to a membrane receptor and
modifying the actin cytoskeleton (papakonstanti et al., 2003).
testosterone is also able to act on gnrh release through a
membrane receptor and this membrane ar-signaling has been
shown to be coupled to a gi protein (shakil et al., 2002). the
 xxxg730xxx  alpha has been shown to interact with the

3360

cytoskeletal protein p130cas (which is involved in the linkage
of the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix) resulting
in  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk activation (cabodi et al., 2004).
in summary, this study demonstrates for the first time
specific, positive cooperative and g-protein-coupled
membrane glucocorticoid receptors, distinct from their
intracellular counterparts and well suited to mediate acute
hpa-axis regulation.
this project was supported by a grant of the austrian science
foundation (project number p15958).
