preattachment embryos and adult tissues

the alkaline phosphatases are a small family of isozymes. bovine preattachment embryos transcribe mrna for two tissue-specific alkaline phosphatases (tsap2 and
tsap3) beginning at the 4- and 8-cell stages. whereas no mrna has been detected in oocytes, there is maternally inherited alkaline phosphatase activity. it is not known which
isozyme(s) is responsible for the maternal activity or when tsap2 and tsap3 form functional protein. no antibodies are available that recognize the relevant bovine alkaline
phosphatases. therefore, sensitivity to heat and chemical inhibition was used to separate
the different isozymes. by screening tissues, it was determined that the bovine tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( xxxg148xxx ) is inactivated by low temperatures (65c) and low concentrations of levamisole (1 mm), whereas bovine tissue-specific isozymes require higher
temperatures (90c) and levamisole concentrations ( 5 mm). inhibition by  xxxd1576xxx 
and l-phenylalanine was less informative. cumulus cells transcribe two isozymes and the
pattern of inhibition suggested heterodimer formation. inhibition of alkaline phosphatase
in bovine embryos before the 8-cell stage indicated the presence of only  xxxg148xxx . at the 16cell stage the pattern was consistent with  xxxg148xxx  plus tsap2 or -3 activity, and in morulae
and blastocysts the pattern indicated that the maternal  xxxg148xxx  is fully supplanted by tsap2
or tsap3. (j histochem cytochem 50:415–422, 2002)
summary

the alkaline phosphatases are a small family of
isozymes expressed in diverse species, including bacteria, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, nematodes, and
insects (mccomb et al. 1979; millan 1988,1990).
conservation of alkaline phosphatase expression hints
at an important role, but to date there is little biochemical evidence for alkaline phosphatase function
except in bone mineralization (yoon et al. 1989; beertsen and van den bos 1992; fedde et al. 1999) and dephosphorylation of adenosine nucleotides (gallo et al.
1997). the alkaline phosphatases have been postulated to be involved in a range of other processes, including cell adhesion (hui et al. 1993),  xxxd2716xxx 
transport (rindi et al. 1995), metastasis (manara et al.

2000), and cell signaling (swarup et al. 1981; muller
et al. 1991). we are interested in their role in the development of mammalian preimplantation embryos.
in mammals, the alkaline phosphatase family consists of two groups, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase and the tissue-specific alkaline phosphatases.
the single tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase
( xxxg148xxx ) gene is expressed in many tissues, including
liver, bone, and kidney (garattini et al. 1987; hsu et
al. 1987; harris 1989; hahnel et al. 1990; macgregor
et al. 1995; hoshi et al. 1997; mcdougall et al. 1998).
humans with mutations in the  xxxg148xxx  isozyme have
defective bone mineralization (infantile hypophosphatasia; henthorn et al. 1992), and mice engineered
to lack  xxxg148xxx  have poor bone mineralization plus a
range of defects that result in postnatal death (narisawa et al. 1997).
the number of tissue-specific alkaline phosphatases
expressed depends on the species. there are two tissue-specific isozymes in mice (manes et al. 1990):  xxxg149xxx  and embryonic alkaline

phosphatase (eap). the eap isozyme is the major
isozyme expressed by 2-cell to blastocyst stage embryos and m-phase spermatogenic cells in the testis
(hahnel et al. 1990; manes et al. 1990; narisawa et
al. 1992; macgregor et al. 1995). mice homozygous
null for the mouse eap gene (eap knockout) are viable (narisawa et al. 1997). however, we found that
its absence disadvantages preimplantation embryos
(dehghani et al. 2000). fewer homozygous null embryos survive than wild-type, particularly under even
mild stress, such as culture. the results suggest that, in
mice, eap is part of an essential process in blastocyst
formation, although its role appears to be duplicated
by another molecule. whether alkaline phosphatase
plays a similar role in preimplantation development in
other mammals remains to be determined. there are
three human tissue-specific alkaline phosphatases: intestinal, germ cell, and placental (harris 1989). ectopic expression of alkaline phosphatases is often
found in cancer cells (millan 1988,1992; millan and
manes 1988). it is not known whether human preimplantation embryos express a tissue-specific alkaline
phosphatase. in cattle, several different cdna sequences have been cloned from intestine (weissig et al.
1993; manes et al. 1998), and we have cloned two tissue-specific cdnas (tsap2 and tsap3) from blastocysts (mcdougall et al. 1998). transcription of tsap2
is first detected at the 4-cell stage in the in vitroderived bovine embryo and tsap3 at the 8-cell stage.
this is equivalent to the mouse 2-cell stage relative to
the initial burst of transcription from the embryonic
genome (telford et al. 1990). therefore, one or both
of these bovine isozymes may be the functional equivalent of the mouse eap. tsap2 also is transcribed in
testis, spleen, and cumulus cells, and tsap3 is transcribed by kidney and oviduct epithelial cells (mcdougall et al. 1998). a complication in the comparison to
mouse is that alkaline phosphatase activity is detected
in all stages from oocyte to blastocyst, although transcription of alkaline phosphatase does not begin until
the late 4-cell stage (mcdougall et al. 1998). it is assumed that the early activity is due to maternal protein from mrna transcribed during oogenesis. which
isozyme is responsible for the maternal activity is unknown. this research was designed to determine the
isozyme(s) responsible for the protein activity encountered in preattachment bovine embryos at the various
stages.
antibodies are currently available for only bovine
 xxxg149xxx . in other species, however,  xxxg148xxx  and the tissue-specific isozymes have different sensitivities to temperature and chemical inhibition by various l-form amino acids and levamisole.
both mouse and human  xxxg148xxx  are particularly sensitive to inhibition with levamisole and  xxxd1576xxx ,
and are comparatively insensitive to l-phenylalanine

(harris 1989; lepire and ziomek 1989; millan 1990).
the tissue-specific isozymes are comparatively insensitive to levamisole and  xxxd1576xxx  and sensitive to
l-phenylalanine inhibition (harris 1989; lepire and
ziomek 1989; millan 1990). the human and murine
tnaps are inactivated by temperatures less than 60c,
whereas the tissue-specific isozymes typically withstand higher temperatures (up to 90c; harris 1989;
lepire and ziomek 1989). therefore, we began this
study with examination of the response of bovine
tissues transcribing various alkaline phosphatase
isozymes to heat and chemical inhibition and subsequently used the information to assay the ap isozymes
expressed in preattachment bovine embryos. because
of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient material for
biochemical tests of alkaline phosphatase from preattachment bovine embryos, a histochemical assay was
used throughout.

materials and methods
tissue preparation
adult bovine tissues (liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, testis)
were recovered at slaughter, flash-frozen in oct embedding
compound (immucore canada; edmonton, alberta, canada) in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80c. sections (7 m)
were cut using a cryostat, mounted on slides, fixed for 20
min with 4% paraformaldehyde (sigma; st louis, mo),
washed three times in pbs, and held briefly in pbs before
treatment.
cumulus cells and bovine oviduct epithelial cells were
prepared during the culture of embryos. cumulus cells were
recovered during the stripping of presumptive zygotes by
gentle pipetting (see below), washed three times in pbs containing 0.1% polyvinyl pyrolidone (pbspvp; fisher scientific, unionville, ontario, canada), and the cells were
smeared on slides. bovine oviduct epithelial cells were recovered from co-culture preparation (see below), washed three
times in pbspvp, and smeared on slides. cells were allowed to dry overnight, then fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and held in pbs until treatment.

embryo preparation
embryos were produced by in vitro maturation, fertilization,
and culture as described previously (xu et al. 1992), with
the following modifications. cumulus–oocyte complexes
were aspirated from visible follicles less than 1 cm in diameter using an 18-gauge needle into modified ham’s f-10 medium (gibco brl; burlington, ontario, canada) containing
10 mm hepes (gibco brl), 2 u/ml heparin (hepalean; organon teknica, toronto, ontario, canada), and 2% heatinactivated steer serum. they were matured for 22–24 hr in
tcm-199 medium (hepes buffered medium 199 with
earle’s salts; gibco brl) containing 55 mg/ml sodium pyruvate and 29 g/ml l-glutamine (sigma) and 1.2% heat-inactivated steer serum. after maturation, oocytes were washed
twice in sperm-talp (greve et al. 1987) buffered with 10
mm hepes (ivf medium) and placed in this medium for
fertilization. sperm were prepared by thawing two 0.5-ml

straws at 38c for 1 hr in ivf medium, subjecting to swimup for 1 hr in ivf medium, and pelleting by centrifugation.
sperm were added to the matured oocytes at a concentration
of 1.0  106 sperm per ml, and incubated for 18 hr at 38c
in 5% co2 in humidified air. presumptive zygotes were
stripped of cumulus by gentle vortexing and co-cultured
with oviduct epithelial cells in medium 199 with earle’s
salts to which was added 55 mg/ml pyruvate, 29 g/ml glutamine, 0.35% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (fraction v; sigma)
and 1.2% steer serum (ivc medium). embryos were removed from culture at specific stages of development (1-cell,
2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell, morula, and blastocyst) to assay
for ap activity. they were rinsed three times in pbspvp,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr, washed three times
in pbspvp, and held in pbspvp.
bovine oviduct epithelial cells for co-culture were prepared as follows. oviducts were trimmed and rinsed and the
epithelium stripped by squeezing the oviduct with fine forceps, forcing sheets of epithelial cells from the oviduct into
ivc medium. large sheets of cells were broken by aspiration
through a 25-gauge needle and cultured in 1.5 ml ivc medium for 24 hr. in vitro culture medium for embryos (see
above) was conditioned for 24 hr by the addition of the oviduct epithelial cells to culture wells on the day of fertilization, 18–24 hr before adding embryos (xu et al. 1992).

als. inhibitors were prepared as 500 mm stock solutions in
pbs, then further diluted to working solutions in 0.1 m tris,
ph 10.0, directly before use. working inhibitor concentrations were 50 mm, 25 mm, 10 mm, 5 mm, and 1 mm for
levamisole (sigma), l-phenylalanine (sigma), and  xxxd1576xxx  (icn biomedicals; costa mesa, ca). tissue sections on slides were incubated for 1 hr in 0.1 m tris, ph
10.0, containing an inhibitor. alkaline phosphatase enzyme
activity was then determined by incubation for 20 min in the
same inhibitor as the previous incubation, containing nbt/
bcip substrate as above, at room temperature in the dark.
sections were rinsed three times in pbs and coverslips were
mounted with aqua-polymount and observed under a light
microscope.
results from adult bovine tissues showed that incubation
in 50, 25, or 10 mm l-phenylalanine and  xxxd1576xxx ,
and 10, 5, or 1 mm levamisole, in 0.1 m tris, ph 10.0, for
1 hr would provide a characteristic pattern of alkaline phosphatase inactivation. embryos were incubated in inhibitor in
0.1 m tris, ph 10.0, for 1 hr, then for 20 min in 0.1 m tris,
ph 10.0, plus inhibitor containing nbt/bcip substrate as
described above. embryos were washed three times in
pbspvp, mounted, and scored as above.

heat inactivation

heat inactivation

there were three independent trials of tissues and embryos.
each trial used tissue from a different individual or a different batch of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. tissue sections were incubated at temperatures ranging from 25c to
100c (in 5c increments) for 1 hr in pbs in an oven (for temperatures less than 80c) or in a water bath (for temperatures
over 80c). sections were removed after 1 hr and rinsed in
pbs. tissue sections were equilibrated for 10 min in 0.1 m
tris, ph 10.0 (sigma). they were then incubated for 20 min
in the same buffer containing nbt/bcip substrate [200 l
substrate per 10 ml 0.1 tris, ph 10.0, nbt (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride), bcip (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; boehringer mannheim, montreal, quebec, canada)]
in the dark at room temperature. sections were rinsed three
times with pbs, counterstained for 5 sec with methyl green
(0.1% w/v solution; allied chemical, new york, ny),
rinsed another three times in pbs, and coverslips mounted
with aqua-polymount (polyscience; warrington, pa).
using bovine tissue sections, incubation at 70c was
found to distinguish  xxxg148xxx  from tissue-specific alkaline
phosphatase activities, so embryos were incubated for 1 hr
at 70c in pbspvp in capped 200 l eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes (to prevent loss of volume due to evaporation).
embryos were recovered from tubes, equilibrated for 10 min
in 0.1 m tris, ph 10.0, and subjected to the ap protein activity assay as previously described, except that embryos
were not counterstained with methyl green. embryos were
mounted in pbs under coverslips sealed with petroleum jelly
to prevent evaporation and were scored immediately.

bovine tissues known to transcribe only tissue-specific
alkaline phosphatase mrna (mcdougall et al. 1998)
were found to require a higher temperature (90c) to
fully eradicate alkaline phosphatase activity than bovine liver (65c), which transcribes only tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (table 1). three trials gave
identical results. figure 1 shows examples of intestinal
tissue incubated at room temperature, 80c, and 90c.
bovine spleen, which transcribes mrna for tsap2
and tsap3, also required incubation for 1 hr at 90c
to fully eradicate activity (figures 1i–1j). kidney, bovine oviduct epithelial cells, and cumulus cells transcribe both  xxxg148xxx  and a tissue-specific isozyme, as determined by rt-pcr (mcdougall et al. 1998), and
therefore could, in theory, express a combination of

alkaline phosphatase proteins. these tissues required a
temperature similar to that of liver  xxxg148xxx  for inactivation (table 1). as shown for kidney in figures 1e–1g,
all positive cells were inactivated at the same temperature (60c); there were no cells with residual thermotolerant activity.
embryos were incubated at 70c for 1 hr, because
we found that this temperature distinguished  xxxg148xxx ,
or a combination of isozymes containing  xxxg148xxx , from
the tissue-specific isozymes in adult tissues. oocytes
and embryos, up to and including the 16-cell stage,
were negative for alkaline phosphatase activity when
incubated for 1 hr at 70c. morulae, blastocysts, and
hatched blastocysts still were positive after 1 hr of incubation (table 2), showing a change from  xxxg148xxx  to
tsap2 or 3-expression after the 16-cell stage. figures
2a, 2b, 2e, and 2f compare alkaline phosphatase activity of 8-cell embryos and early blastocysts incubated at room temperature and 70c.
chemical inactivation

table 1 summarizes the concentration of inhibitor
that eliminated bovine alkaline phosphatase activity in

adult tissues. again, this occurred at the same incremental step for each tissue in all three trials. figures
1d and 1h show examples of intestine and kidney
incubated with 10 mm and 1 mm levamisole, respectively, and figures 1k and 1l compare spleen incubated
in 10 mm and 25 mm  xxxd1576xxx . levamisole is
a potent bovine  xxxg148xxx  inhibitor, effectively blocking
all alkaline phosphatase activity in liver at 1 mm,
whereas levamisole did not block the intestinal activity until 10 mm and spleen activity (tsap2 or -3) until 5 mm. kidney and bovine oviduct epithelial cells,
which transcribe a combination of  xxxg148xxx  and tsap3,
require 1 mm lev, similar to liver  xxxg148xxx , but cumulus cells, which contain message for  xxxg148xxx  
tsap2, required 5 mm levamisole for inactivation,
like spleen. bovine liver  xxxg148xxx  was inactivated by 25
mm  xxxd1576xxx , bovine  xxxg149xxx  by 50 mm, and bovine spleen by 50 mm.
but kidney again behaved as  xxxg148xxx , while bovine oviduct epithelial cells and cumulus cells required concentrations like those of the intestinal isozyme (50
mm  xxxd1576xxx ). liver required 50 mm l-phenylalanine for inactivation, while intestinal tissue required 50 mm and spleen 25 mm. again, kidney and
oviduct epithelial cells did not match, although containing mrna for the same isozymes, with kidney requiring 50 mm and the oviduct cells needing 50
mm. cumulus cells also required 50 mm l-phenylalanine for inactivation.
in preattachment embryos, the inactivation of alkaline phosphatase by chemical inhibitors changed with
each stage examined (table 2). examples of early
blastocysts and 8-cell embryos incubated in 5 mm levamisole and 50 mm l-phenylalanine are shown in
figures 2c, 2d, 2g, and 2h. oocytes, 2-, 4-, and 8-cell
embryos required 1 mm levamisole to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity. sixteen-cell through hatched
blastocysts required 1 mm levamisole, 5 mm for
16-cell and morula, 10 mm for blastocysts, and 10
mm for hatched blastocysts. oocytes and 2-cell embryos required 10 mm  xxxd1576xxx , while 4and 8-cell embryos required 50 mm and 16-cell embryos required 50 mm for inactivation of alkaline
phosphatase activity. oocyte activity was inhibited by
10 mm l-phenylalanine, 2-cell through 16-cell embryos by 25 mm, morula and all blastocysts by 50
mm. again, there was no evidence of two-step inactivation, even in embryos known to have mrna for

discussion
inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by temperature and levamisole provided the clearest distinctions
between bovine isozymes in this histochemical analysis. adult bovine tissues transcribing only a tissue-specific or combination of tissue-specific mrna require
higher temperatures and higher levamisole concentrations to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity than tissues expressing  xxxg148xxx  alone (see intestine and spleen
vs liver in table 1). this corresponds with data from
mice reported by lepire and ziomek (1989) and with
data from humans reported by harris (1989).
the alkaline phosphatases usually are described as
homodimers. in mouse and humans there is expression of different isozymes (homodimers) by different
cell types, e.g., in the testis (narisawa et al. 1992).
however, formation of functional heterodimers has
been found in human cell lines (wray and harris
1982; kodama et al. 1994) and in neutrophils of individuals with down’s syndrome (vergnes et al. 1999).
in bovine preattachment embryos there is simultaneous transcription of tsap2 and tsap3 by what appears to be a homogeneous population of embryonic
cells. therefore, it is interesting to compare the bovine
tissues transcribing a combination of isozymes to tissues transcribing a single class of alkaline phosphatase. the results suggest that  xxxg148xxx /tsap2 heterodimers may be formed in cumulus cells. if there
were two distinct homodimer populations in cumulus
cells, it would be expected that  xxxg148xxx  would be inactivated before tsap2 with heat and levamisole. this
would result in a loss of activity from some cells or a
partial loss of activity in all cells at approximately
60c and 1 mm levamisole, with a further loss at

90c and 5 mm levamisole. this was not observed.
if only one isozyme formed functional protein in cumulus cells (although two are transcribed), then the
inhibition profile would probably resemble that of either tsap2 or  xxxg148xxx  alone. heat inactivation of cumulus cells was like  xxxg148xxx , and the levamisole inhibition like that of a tissue-specific alkaline phosphatase.
one explanation for the response to the different inhibitors is suggested by the report that functions of
human  xxxg149xxx  subunits are
only partly independent of each other (hoylaerts et al.
1997). in contrast, bovine kidney and oviduct epithelial cells transcribe  xxxg148xxx  and tsap3. neither tissue
had an inhibition profile that was clearly distinct from
liver with  xxxg148xxx  alone. it is possible that tsap3 is not
translated or that it behaves differently from tsap2
in combination with  xxxg148xxx . unfortunately, bovine
tsap2 and tsap3 messages were not detected alone
in a tissue, and therefore their individual temperature
and levamisole sensitivities could not be determined.
inhibition of bovine  xxxg149xxx 
and  xxxg148xxx  with  xxxd1576xxx  and l-phenylalanine
was similar to what has been described for the mouse
isozymes (lepire and ziomek 1989) and human (fishman 1974; harris 1989; millan 1990). however, the
differences between the classes were smaller in our histochemical assay and were not helpful in further distinguishing the different isozymes.
the inhibition profiles of the bovine alkaline phosphatases in adult tissues proved to be useful for analyzing expression in preattachment bovine embryos.
bovine embryos transcribe mrna for tsap2 and
tsap3 starting at the 4-cell and 8-cell stages, respectively (mcdougall et al. 1998). however, maternally
derived activity is found in the oocyte and is presumably the predominant activity present on at least 1-cell
to 4-cell embryos. the inhibition profile of alkaline
phosphatase activity on oocytes through 8-cell em-

at low temperature and high levamisole. therefore,
 xxxg148xxx  is the maternally-inherited isozyme and the
predominate alkaline phosphatase during cleavage. by
the 16-cell stage the inhibition was similar to that of
cumulus cells, suggesting residual maternal  xxxg148xxx 
plus a newly transcribed tissue-specific isozyme (either
tsap2 or tsap3). after the 16-cell stage the profile
was that of a tissue-specific alkaline phosphatase, indicating full replacement of maternal  xxxg148xxx  with embryonic tsap2 or -3. in hatched blastocysts,  xxxg148xxx 
message is again detected but the activity profile still is
that of a tissue-specific isozyme, indicating that little
or no functional  xxxg148xxx  is synthesized before implantation. whether both tsap2 and tsap3 are translated in morulae and blastocysts could not be determined, but this study shows that  xxxg148xxx  is expressed
during early cleavage and is supplanted by tsap2 or
tsap3 by the morula stage.
transition from a cleavage-stage embryo to a blastocyst is required for further development and is associated with a number of processes. the first burst of
transcription from the embryonic genome in cows occurs at the 8-cell stage (telford et al. 1990), and an
outer epithelium (the trophectoderm) differentiates
over the 16- to 32-cell stage (morula). during the
equivalent stages in mice, there is evidence for chromatin remodeling and post-translational modifications in the activities of a variety of proteins commonly associated with epithelia (reviewed in pratt
1989; collins and fleming 1995; thompson 1996).
although there is strong evidence that phosphorylation is important in these events, there has been little
research on the enzymes that dephosphorylate proteins in preimplantation embryos. we found that a homozygous null mutation of eap in preimplantation
mouse embryos is associated with loss of 8-cell stage
embryos, when epithelialization of the outer cells begins (dehghani et al. 2000). in the bovine, tsap2 or
tsap3 protein activity is first detected in 16-cell stage
embryos and morulae, as an epithelium begins to form
in this species. this lends support to a hypothesis that
a tissue-specific alkaline phosphatase is generally expressed by mammalian preimplantation embryos, and
that it plays a role in forming the trophectoderm.
