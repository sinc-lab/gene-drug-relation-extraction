abstract
background: caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in the
world, and individual differences in response to its stimulating effects may explain some of the variability in caffeine consumption
within a population.
objective: we examined whether genetic variability in caffeine
metabolism [ xxxg576xxx  (cyp1a2) ҁ163a3 c] or the
main target of caffeine action in the nervous system [adenosine a2a
receptor (adora2a) 1083c3 t] is associated with habitual caffeine consumption.
design: subjects (n ҃ 2735) were participants from a study of
gene-diet interactions and risk of myocardial infarction who did not
have a history of hypertension. genotype frequencies were examined among persons who were categorized according to their selfreported daily caffeine intake, as assessed with a validated foodfrequency questionnaire.
results: the adora2a, but not the cyp1a2, genotype was associated with different amounts of caffeine intake. compared with
persons consuming 쏝100 mg caffeine/d, the odds ratios for having
the adora2a tt genotype were 0.74 (95% ci: 0.53, 1.03), 0.63
(95% ci: 0.48, 0.83), and 0.57 (95% ci: 0.42, 0.77) for those consuming 100 –200, 쏜200 – 400, and 쏜400 mg caffeine/d, respectively. the association was more pronounced among current smokers than among nonsmokers (p for interaction ҃ 0.07). persons with
the adora2a tt genotype also were significantly more likely to
consume less caffeine (ie, 쏝100 mg/d) than were carriers of the c
allele [p ҃ 0.011 (nonsmokers), p ҃ 0.008 (smokers)].
conclusion: our findings show that the probability of having the
adora2a 1083tt genotype decreases as habitual caffeine consumption increases. this observation provides a biologic basis for
caffeine consumption behavior and suggests that persons with this
genotype may be less vulnerable to caffeine dependence.

introduction

caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in the world
with an estimated 80 –90% of adults reporting regular consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and foods (1). caffeine
intakes vary widely from country to country and from person to
person (2, 3). the pleasurable and reinforcing effects of caffeine
have led to some concern that it is a potential drug of dependence

240

(1, 4, 5). however, some persons experience anxiety, tachycardia, nervousness. or other adverse effects with low-to-moderate
intakes of caffeine (4). these differences in response to caffeine
may explain some of the variability in caffeine intake within a
population (1, 6, 7). although demographic, psychosocial,
health-related, and environmental factors such as smoking have
been linked to habitual caffeine consumption (8 –11), there is
some evidence that genetic factors are also important (12–15).
twin studies report heritability estimates of up to 77% for caffeine use, toxicity, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms (12–15),
but the specific genes involved are not yet identified.
caffeine is metabolized primarily by  xxxg576xxx 
(cyp1a2) in the liver through an initial n3-demethylation (16,
17). cyp1a2 accounts for 앒95% of caffeine metabolism and
shows wide variability in enzyme activity between persons (17–
19). an a to c substitution at position ҁ163 (rs762551) in the
cyp1a2 gene decreases enzyme inducibility as measured by
plasma or urinary caffeine-to-metabolite ratios after a dose of
caffeine (20). carriers of the ҁ163c allele can be considered
slow caffeine metabolizers, whereas persons who are homozygous for the ҁ163a allele are more rapid caffeine metabolizers
(20). it is not clear, however, whether cyp1a2 genotype alters
caffeine consumption.
in amounts typically consumed from dietary sources, caffeine
antagonizes the actions of adenosine at the  xxxg82xxx  (1), which was shown to play an important role in the stimulating and reinforcing properties of caffeine (21, 22).  xxxg82xxx 
knockout mice have been found to have less of an appetite for
caffeine than do their wild-type littermates (23). a c-to-t substitution at nucleotide position 1083 (rs5751876) (also referred to
as 1976c3 t) in the adora2a gene, which codes for the a2a

adora2a genotype and caffeine consumption

receptor, was associated with caffeine-induced anxiety among
nonhabitual caffeine consumers (24). persons who were homozygous for the 1083t allele experienced greater anxiety after
consuming 150 mg caffeine (24). however, it is not known
whether persons with that genotype limit their habitual caffeine
intake because of such adverse physiologic effects. the purpose
of the present study was to examine whether genetic variability
in caffeine metabolism (ie, cyp1a2) or the major target of caffeine action in the central nervous system (cns) (ie, adora2a)
is associated with habitual caffeine consumption in a free-living
population.

subjects and methods

study design and participants
details of the study design (case-control study) and participants were reported previously (25). subjects were selfdescribed hispanic americans living in costa rica and participating in a study of gene-diet interactions and risk of myocardial
infarction (mi). eligible cases were men and women who were
survivors of a first acute mi between 1994 and 2004. cases were
ineligible if they died during hospitalization, were 욷75 y old on
the day of their first mi, were physically or mentally unable to
answer the questionnaire, or had a previous hospital admission
related to cardiovascular disease. one control for each case,
matched for age (앐5 y), sex, and area of residence (county), was
randomly selected with the use of information available at the
national census and statistics bureau of costa rica. because of
the comprehensive social services provided in costa rica, all
persons living in the catchment areas had access to medical care
without regard to income. controls were ineligible if they were
physically or mentally unable to answer the questionnaires or if
they had a previous hospital admission related to mi or other
cardiovascular disease. participation for eligible cases and controls was 98% and 88%, respectively. for the current study, all
subjects reporting a history of hypertension were excluded because these persons may have reduced their caffeine intake on the
advice of their physician. indeed, a significantly (p 쏝 0.001)
smaller proportion of persons with a history of hypertension
(14%) than of persons with no history of hypertension (21%)
reported consuming 쏜400 mg caffeine/d. all subjects were visited at their homes for the collection of information on diet and
medical history, for anthropometric measurements, and collection of biologic specimens.
cases and controls gave written informed consent. the study was
approved by the ethics committees of the harvard school of public
health and the university of costa rica, the office of protection
from research risk at the national institutes of health, and the
ethics review committee at the university of toronto.
all data were collected during an interview with trained fieldworkers who used 2 questionnaires. the questionnaires consisted of closed-ended questions about smoking, sociodemographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, physical activity,
diet, and medical history, including use of medication and personal history of diabetes and hypertension. dietary intake was
collected with the use of a 135-item semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaire specifically developed and validated to
assess dietary intake during the previous year in the costa rican
population (26). for cases, average intake represented the year
preceding their mi. included in the food-frequency questionnaire

were questions about the consumption of caffeinated coffee, tea,
cola beverages, and chocolate. total caffeine intake was calculated with the use of the us department of agriculture foodcomposition data file. subjects were categorized into 4 groups
with self-reported caffeine intakes of 쏝100, 100 –200, 쏜200 –
400, or 쏜400 mg/d.
genotyping
blood samples were collected in the morning at the subject’s
home after an overnight fast and were centrifuged at 1430 ҂ g for
4 min at 20 °c to separate the plasma and leukocytes for dna
isolation by standard procedures. the cyp1a2 ҁ163a3 c
(rs762551) and adora2a 1083c3 t (rs5751876) polymorphisms were detected by restriction-fragment length polymorphism–polymerase chain reaction as described previously (27,
28). genotype distributions among subjects did not deviate from
hardy-weinberg equilibrium (p 쏜 0.05).
statistical analysis
all data were analyzed with the use of sas software (version
8.2; sas institute, cary, nc). dna was available from 2873
subjects with no history of hypertension. because caffeine consumption data were based on the year before incidence of mi,
cases with nonfatal mi as well as population-based controls were
included in the analyses. nine subjects with missing data on
caffeine intake and smoking status and 129 who could not be
genotyped for either cyp1a2 or adora2a were also excluded
from the study. these exclusions left a total sample size of 2735
for the final analyses.
significant differences in the distribution of lifestyle characteristics by cyp1a2 and adora2a genotype were tested with
the use of pearson’s chi-square test (categorical variables) or t
tests (continuous variables). analyses were conducted with the
use of a dominant cyp1a2 c allele model with ac and cc
genotypes (slow metabolizers) combined, because the 2 groups
have a similar rate of caffeine metabolism (20). for adora2a,
results are presented with the use of a recessive adora2a t
allele model with cc and ct genotypes combined because no
differences in caffeine-induced anxiety were reported between
persons with the cc or ct genotype (24). odds ratios and 95%
cis were estimated by unconditional logistic regression to determine the relation between caffeine consumption and the risk of
having the cyp1a2 c allele or adora2a tt genotype with the
lowest caffeine intake (쏝100 mg/d) as the reference group. a test
for linear trend was calculated across categories of caffeine intake for each polymorphism by treating caffeine intake as an
ordinal variable. pearson’s chi-square test with 1 df was used to
compare the proportion of light caffeine consumers (ie, persons
consuming 쏝100 mg caffeine/d) among each genotype. nonsmokers (never or past smokers) and current smokers were examined separately because smokers metabolize caffeine more
rapidly than nonsmokers, and smokers may respond differently
to the stimulating effects of caffeine as a result of the interaction
of the  xxxg82xxx  with the  xxxg656xxx , which plays
a role in the behavioral effects of both caffeine and nicotine (1).
caffeine-smoking interactions were tested by comparing ҁ2 log
(likelihood) ratios from a model with caffeine intakes and smoking as main effects only and from another that included their
interaction term. all statistical analysis were 2-sided, and p values 쏝 0.05 were considered significant.

observed among current smokers and nonsmokers. we next examined whether persons consuming different amounts of caffeine varied genetically at the  xxxg82xxx , the main target of
caffeine action in the cns. compared with persons consuming
쏝100 mg caffeine/d, the odds ratios of having the adora2a
1083tt genotype were 0.74 (0.53, 1.03), 0.63 (0.48, 0.83), and
0.57 (0.42, 0.77) in those consuming 100 –200, 쏜200 – 400, and
쏜400 mg caffeine/d, respectively (p for trend 쏝 0.001; table 3).
this association was more pronounced among current smokers
than among nonsmokers (p ҃ 0.07 for caffeine-smoking interaction). among smokers, the odds ratios of having the
adora2a 1083tt genotype were 0.77 (0.37, 1.66), 0.47 (0.25,
0.86), and 0.37 (0.12, 0.70) in those consuming 100 –200, 쏜200 –
400, and 쏜400 mg caffeine/d, respectively. we next examined
whether those with the adora2a 1083tt genotype limit
their caffeine intake; we found that persons with this genotype
were significantly (p ҃ 0.0007) more likely to consume 쏝100
mg caffeine/d than were carriers of the adora2a 1083c
allele (figure 1).

discussion

although caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in
the world, there is large interindividual variability in its consumption (1–3). this variability may, in part, be due to individual
differences in response to the stimulating effects of caffeine (1,
6, 7). twin studies have suggested that genetic factors play an
important role in determining habitual caffeine consumption and
response to caffeine (12–15). however, the specific genes involved are not yet identified. in the present study, we examined
whether genetic polymorphisms affecting caffeine metabolism
or the main site of caffeine action influence habitual caffeine
consumption in a free-living population. our findings show that
the probability of having the adora2a 1083tt genotype decreases as the caffeine intake increases in a population, and that
persons with that genotype are more likely to limit their caffeine

intake. however, we found no association between the cyp1a2
ҁ163a3 c polymorphism and caffeine intake. this is consistent with our previous study showing no differences in cyp1a2
genotype frequencies across categories of coffee intake (25).
although coffee is the main source of caffeine in this population
(쏜90% of total caffeine intake), our previous study included
subjects with a history of hypertension who may have been
avoiding caffeine because of its link with high blood pressure
(29). these observations suggest that, for caffeine consumption
behavior, persons may not be sensitive to differences in the rate
of caffeine metabolism, but they appear to be sensitive to differences in the interaction between caffeine and the adenosinergic
system.
previous studies have identified numerous environmental factors that are associated with caffeine consumption, many of
which have been accounted for in observational studies of caffeinated beverage consumption and various health outcomes.
because our findings suggest that the adora2a 1083c3 t
polymorphism is associated with caffeine consumption within a
population, this polymorphism may be a potential genetic confounder in these observational studies.
 xxxg82xxx –mediated adenosinergic neuromodulation was
implicated in the development of various neurologic disorders,
such as parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and panic disorder.
studies have examined the association between the adora2a
1083c3 t polymorphism and the risk of these disorders (30,
31), but findings have been inconsistent. on the basis of mendel’s principle of independent inheritance, these studies reasonably assume that the adora2a 1083c3 t polymorphism is a
marker of  xxxg82xxx  function, which is unlikely to be associated with diet or other lifestyle characteristics (32). therefore,
any difference in risk should provide evidence for the role of the

 xxxg82xxx  in the development of these disorders. although
adora2a genotype may reflect  xxxg82xxx  function, our findings show that it is also associated with caffeine consumption,
thereby violating the assumption of independence. as a result,
caffeine consumption may be a confounder in studies examining
the main effect of adora2a genotype on various health outcomes.
debate is ongoing as to whether caffeine is a potential drug of
dependence (1, 4). the 10th edition of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems
from the world health organization recognizes a diagnosis of
substance dependence due to caffeine, but the fourth edition of
the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders from
the american psychiatric association does not. caffeine elicits
pleasurable and reinforcing effects in some persons that may lead
to dependence (1, 4, 5). other persons, however, experience
anxiety, tachycardia, nervousness, or other adverse effects with
low-to-moderate intakes of caffeine, and they are unlikely to
develop dependence (1, 4). a polymorphism of the adora2a
gene was previously associated with caffeine-induced anxiety
(24), and we now show that persons with this genotype limit their

244

cornelis et al

caffeine intake. this observation provides a biological basis for
caffeine consumption behavior and suggests that persons with
this genotype may be less vulnerable to caffeine dependence.
our results are consistent with evidence showing the important role that behavioral responses to caffeine play in habitual
caffeine consumption (1, 6, 7). however, the role of other genetic
or environmental factors affecting caffeine consumption cannot
be excluded. for example, genetic differences in taste were
shown to affect how persons rate the bitter taste of caffeine,
which may in turn affect their preference for caffeinated beverages (33). we excluded persons with a history of hypertension,
but some persons may avoid caffeinated beverages because of
other perceived adverse health effects. finally, the social context
in which caffeinated beverages are consumed could also contribute to habitual caffeine consumption. these factors, however,
would have attenuated the effect of adora2a genotype on
caffeine consumption.
in summary, genetic variation in the  xxxg82xxx , the main
target of caffeine action in the cns, is associated with caffeine
consumption in a free-living population. the association between adora2a genotype and caffeine consumption suggests
that this genetic variant might be a confounder in observational
studies that relate caffeine intake to certain health outcomes.
variation in the adenosinergic system also may be an important
factor in studies of a genetic predisposition to caffeine dependence, a subject of ongoing debate (1, 5).
