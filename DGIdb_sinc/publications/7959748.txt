opioid receptors are the membrane proteins that
mediate the pain-relieving effect of opioid drugs, such
as morphine and fentanyl] as well as endogenous opioid
peptides enkephalins and endorphins. using cdnas
for the » and the « opioid receptors, we mapped the
chromosomal locations of their genes in mouse.
multilocus cross analysis located the y receptor gene
 xxxg1635xxx  on chr 10 and the « receptor gene oprki1 on chr
1. both genes are near centromere, with no markers
more centromeric. these data indicate that the two
opioid receptors are different gene products, ruling
out the possibility that they may be differential splic-
ing products from the same gene. © 1994 academic press, inc.

opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, are some of
the most widely used analgesics in the clinical manage-
ment of pain (10). opioids selectively affect the percep-
tion of pain, without significantly influencing other sen-
sory modalities such as touch, smell, or vision. opioid
compounds include endogenous peptides and their syn-
thetic analogues, alkaloids derived from opium, and
semisynthetic alkaloids. the powerful effects of opioids
in the body are mediated through the opioid receptors
localized on the plasma membrane of neurons and
other peripheral cells. there are at least three types of
opioid receptors, mu (,:), kappa (x), and delta (5), each
with a distinct pharmacological profile (11). because
the cellular effects of opioids can be blocked by reagents
known to interfere with the function of heterotrimeric
gtp binding proteins (g proteins), opioid receptors are
thought to belong to a family of membrane receptors
that transduce their intracellular signals via g protein-
coupled pathways (6, 16).

we have recently cloned cdnas for the y and x opioid
receptors from the rat brain (4, 5). these receptors pos-
sess a putative secondary structure of seven transmem-
brane domains common to g protein-coupled receptors
and display functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase.

the cloning of these opioid receptors thus provides the
opportunity to determine the chromosomal location of
the respective genes. here we report the results of such
a mapping analysis.

to map the receptor genes, we analyzed the progeny
of two multilocus crosses: (nfs/n or c58/j x mus mus
musculus) x m. m. musculus (14), and (nfs/n x mus
spretus) x m. spretus or c58/j (1). genomic dnas from
parental and backcross mice were used in southern
blot hybridizations following electrophoresis on 0.4%
agarose gels run at 24 v for 48 h to separate large
fragments as described previously (13) to identify re-
striction length variants. radioactive hybridization
probes were prepared by random priming with the
cdnas for the » and « opioid receptors (4, 5) as tem-
plates. distinct sets of fragments were recognized by
the cdnas for the opioid receptors, whether the protein
coding region or the 3’ untranslated region was used
(data not shown). progeny of these crosses in mice have
also been typed for over 550 markers, including the
chr 1 markers d1mit1 (chr 1 dna marker, mit-1),
gis ( xxxg907xxx ), [dhi (isocitrate dehydrogenase-1),
and mtap2 ( xxxg1360xxx ) and the
chr 10 markers i/gr (interferon-y receptor),  xxxg1486xxx  (mye-
loblastosis oncogene), and pfp (pore-forming protein).
the markers mtap2 and  xxxg1130xxx  were typed as previously
described (3), and gls was typed using as probe the
529-bp insert of the clone pga-1 obtained from atcc
following digestion with ssti in the m. spretus cross.
iliri ( xxxg1171xxx , type i) was typed follow-
ing ecori digestion in the m. spretus cross and bamhi
digestion in the m. m. musculus cross using as probe
a 535-bp ecori/hindui fragment of the cytoplasmic
domain of the il-1 receptor kindly provided by dr. john
sims (immunex) (19). the sslp marker dimiti was
typed as described by dietrich et al. (8), and the pcr
products were sized on agarose gels following staining
with  xxxg677xxx . ifgr,  xxxg1486xxx , and pfp were typed in the m. m.
musculus cross as described (14), and the same probes
were used to type these markers in the m. spretus cross
following digestion with ecori, bamhi, and bgill, re-
spectively.

for the » opioid receptor, digestion with ecori gener-
ated fragments of 16.5 and 2.7 kb in parental nfs/n

and 12.0, 3.0, and 2.7 kb in m. m. musculus, and diges-
tion with psti generated fragments of 5.6 kb and 5.2
and 4.0 kb in nfs/n and m. spretus, respectively. for
the « opioid receptor, nfs/n and m. spretus produced
apal fragments, both of which were greater in size than
the largest size marker (28 kb) but which were clearly
distinguishable in size (not shown), whereas nfs/n
and m. m. musculus produced hindiii fragments of 5.5
and 6.0 kb, respectively.

comparison of the inheritance of the restriction frag-
ments with over 550 markers previously typed in these
two crosses established linkage between the p opioid
receptor gene  xxxg1635xxx  and markers on proximal chr 10
(fig. 1). these data position  xxxg1635xxx  in a region with
conserved linkage with human chromosome 6q.

linkage was also established between the x opioid
receptor gene  xxxg1633xxx  and the markers on proximal chr
1 (fig. 2). the region of chr 1 where oprki maps con-
tains a recessive mutation, tumbler (¢b) (7). homozy-
gous tumbler mice show neurological symptoms by 15
days of age with a crab-like forward gait and have
poorly controlled motor functions, such as falling over
when trying to go forward and inability to hold on to a

rope. there are no major lesions in the central nervous
system, but the endocrine glands and lymphoid tissues
show abnormalities (9, 15). since the opioids are known
to have effects on the endocrine and lymphoid systems
(2, 17, 18), further investigation of the potential role
of the « opioid receptor in this mutant phenotype is
warranted.
