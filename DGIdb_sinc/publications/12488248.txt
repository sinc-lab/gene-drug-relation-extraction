basolateral uptake of organic anions in renal proximal tubule
cells is indirectly coupled to the na⫹ gradient through na⫹dicarboxylate cotransport and organic anion/dicarboxylate
exchange. one member of the organic anion transporter (oat)
family, oat1, is expressed in the proximal tubule and is an
organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger. however, a second
organic anion carrier,  xxxg2115xxx , is also highly expressed in the
renal proximal tubule, but its mechanism is unclear. thus we
have assessed  xxxg2115xxx  function in xenopus laevis oocytes and
rat renal cortical slices. probenecid-sensitive uptake of paminohippurate (pah, an oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx  substrate) and
 xxxd2046xxx  (es, an  xxxg2115xxx  substrate) in rat  xxxg2115xxx -expressing oocytes was significantly trans-stimulated by preloading
the oocytes with the dicarboxylate glutarate (ga). ga stimulation of es transport by oocytes coexpressing rabbit na⫹dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 and rat  xxxg2115xxx  was significantly
inhibited when the preloading medium contained li⫹ or
methylsuccinate (ms) or when na⫹ was absent. all these
treatments inhibit the na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter, but
not rat  xxxg2115xxx . li⫹, ms, and na⫹ removal had no effect when
applied during the es uptake step, rather than during the
ga preloading step. concentrative es uptake in rat renal
cortical slices was also demonstrated to be probenecid and
na⫹ sensitive. accumulation of es was stimulated by ga,
and this stimulation was completely blocked by probenecid,
li⫹, ms,  xxxd3296xxx , and removal of na⫹. thus  xxxg2115xxx  functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that couples organic anion uptake indirectly to the na⫹ gradient.

nephron. the first step in renal organic anion secretion, i.e., uptake at the basolateral membrane of renal
proximal tubule cells, is mediated, uphill, and na⫹
dependent (for a review, see refs. 38 and 47). mechanistically, this step is driven by indirect coupling to the
na⫹ gradient through na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransport
and organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange (tertiary active transport; fig. 1) (34, 36, 37, 42). there is some
uncertainty about the nature of the final step in organic anion secretion, i.e., efflux across the apical
membrane.
oat1 was the first renal oat to be cloned (25, 41,
49). not only was oat1 localized to the basolateral
membrane of renal proximal tubules (45, 51), but also
it was shown to support organic anion/dicarboxylate
exchange (49). thus it was assumed that oat1 was
indeed the transporter that drove the classic, na⫹dependent renal organic anion system. however, basolateral organic anion transport appears to be considerably more complex and may also be driven by one of the
other oats that have been cloned recently and partially characterized:  xxxg2114xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  (10, 23, 40,
43). together with oat1, they comprise a subfamily of
the amphiphilic solute transporter family (slc22a)
within the major facilitator superfamily (7, 44, 47, 52).
the mechanisms by which  xxxg2114xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx 
couple transport to cellular metabolism have not been
defined. this lack of understanding is particularly important for  xxxg2115xxx , inasmuch as it is the most highly
expressed oat in kidney and choroid plexus (28, 46).
recent immunolocalization studies detected the rat
and human  xxxg2115xxx  orthologs (roat and hoat, respectively) in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules (9, 22, 28). functional analysis of an  xxxg2115xxx  knockout mouse model confirmed that murine  xxxg2115xxx  was
present in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells and in the apical membrane of choroid plexus
epithelial cells (i.e., the correct locations to mediate
concentrative organic anion uptake) and that the
transporter mediates a substantial fraction of organic
anion uptake across the basolateral membrane of the

 xxxg2115xxx  is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger

fig. 1. model for classic renal organic anion (oa⫺) secretion. basolateral oa⫺ uptake on the classic renal oa⫺ transport system is
indirectly coupled to the na⫹ gradient by what has been termed a
tertiary active process. this process derives energy from atp hydrolysis when na⫹-k⫹-atpase (atp) pumps na⫹ out of the cell. energetically downhill movement of na⫹ into the cell drives an na⫹dicarboxylate cotransporter (nadc), which maintains an outwardly
directed dicarboxylate gradient. finally, the dicarboxylate is used as
a counterion by a dicarboxylate/oa⫺ exchanger (oat) to drive entry
of the oa⫺ substrate into the cell. it is uncertain whether efflux
across the apical membrane occurs via oa⫺ exchange or membrane
potential difference-driven facilitated diffusion. ␣-kg, ␣-ketoglutarate; prob, probenecid; ms, methylsuccinate.

renal proximal tubule and at the apical membrane of
choroid plexus (46). when  xxxg2115xxx  was initially cloned
and expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes, experiments
indicated that  xxxg2115xxx -mediated organic anion uptake
was neither coupled to the na⫹ gradient nor transstimulated by dicarboxylates (9, 23). no mechanism
explaining how  xxxg2115xxx  could mediate uphill oa transport was demonstrated, and it was argued that  xxxg2115xxx  is
not energetically coupled to metabolism but, rather, is
simply a facilitated-diffusion carrier (9, 23). however,
facilitated diffusion cannot drive organic anion uptake
in the face of opposing electrical and concentration
gradients, as required in the renal proximal tubule and
choroid plexus.
we recently found reduced uptake of p-aminohippurate (pah), the model substrate for the classic renal
oat system, in renal cortical slices from  xxxg2115xxx  knockout mice (46). because in every species tested, from
mammals to invertebrates, pah uptake by renal tissue
is concentrative and almost entirely na⫹ dependent,
these results argued for a reassessment of the mechanism of  xxxg2115xxx -mediated transport. in the present study,
we have assessed the energetics of  xxxg2115xxx  using x. laevis
oocytes expressing roat3 and rat renal cortical slices.
our experiments unequivocally show that  xxxg2115xxx , similar to oat1, is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that indirectly couples concentrative organic
anion uptake to the na⫹ gradient. thus, on the basis of
energetics, transport on  xxxg2115xxx  is indistinguishable from
transport on oat1.
materials and methods

transport assays. x. laevis oocytes were obtained from
dissected ovaries by collagenase a treatment. substrate uptake assays were performed 3 days after injection with 20 ng
of capped crna as previously described (14, 45, 48). oocytes
were randomly divided into experimental groups of four to
eight each and incubated for 10 or 60 min at room temperature in oocyte ringer 2 (or-2) medium (in mm: 82.5 nacl,

␮ci/ml) or 100 nm 3h-labeled  xxxd2046xxx  (es; 2 ␮ci/ml)
in the absence or presence of 1 mm probenecid, 5 mm licl, or
1 mm methylsuccinate (ms). individual oocyte radioactivity
was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy with external quench correction. for experiments involving expression
of oat1 and an na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter, crna synthesized from  xxxg2113xxx  and rabbit na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (rbnadc-1) cdna (33) were coinjected at a ratio of
2:1. for trans-stimulation studies, oocytes were preloaded by
90 min of incubation in or-2 medium containing 0–5 mm
glutarate (ga) or ms and quickly rinsed in ga- or ms-free
medium before initiation of uptake. na⫹-free uptake was
determined in or-2 medium isosmotically adjusted using
n-methylglucamine.
rat renal tissue slice preparation and uptake assays were
performed according to standard laboratory protocols (35,
37). animals were euthanized by co2 inhalation, and kidneys were dissected into freshly oxygenated ice-cold saline.
tissue slices (ⱕ0.5 mm, ⬃5–10 mg wet wt) were maintained
in ice-cold modified cross and taggart saline (in mm: 95
nacl, 80 mannitol, 5 kcl, 0.74 cacl2, and 9.5 na2hpo4, ph
7.4). substrate (100 nm [3h]es) uptake was determined after
5–60 min of incubation in the presence and absence of inhibitors or na⫹ (na⫹-free medium was isosmotically adjusted
using n-methylglucamine). after uptake was determined,
slices were rinsed, blotted, and weighed and then dissolved in
1 ml of 1 m naoh, neutralized with 1 ml of 1 m hcl, and
assayed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. duplicate medium samples (50 ␮l) were also assayed. uptakes were calculated as uncorrected tissue-to-medium ratios [i.e., (dpm/mg
tissue) ⫼ (dpm/␮l medium)].
all animal experiments were conducted under protocols
approved by the national institute of environmental health
sciences animal care and use committee.

chemicals. [3h]pah (4 ci/mmol) and [3h]es (40 ci/mmol)
were purchased from perkinelmer life sciences (boston,

take of pah and es by roat3-expressing oocytes (figs.
2 and 3). this trans stimulation of roat3-mediated es
uptake increased in a ga concentration-dependent
manner, with 2.5 mm ga preloading causing a maximal increase over nonpreloaded oocytes (data not

oocytes with ms, a dicarboxylate that cannot substitute for ␣-ketoglutarate (␣-kg) or ga on oat1 (11, 18,

to determine whether the ga trans-stimulation of
roat3-mediated transport observed in figs. 2 and 3

established that the na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter
(but not the organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger) is
inhibited by 5 mm li⫹, 1 mm ms, and na⫹ replacement (6, 34, 37). we therefore determined the effects of
those treatments on the ability of ga preloading to
stimulate es uptake in doubly injected oocytes (fig. 4).
cells incubated in or-2 medium containing 100 ␮m
ga for 90 min before es uptake showed a significant
increase in es accumulation (fig. 4). li⫹ and ms
added to the preloading buffer completely blocked the
trans-stimulatory effect of ga, and preincubation in
na⫹-free medium significantly reduced stimulation by
ga (fig. 4). these treatments were without effect
when imposed during the 10-min es uptake period,
rather than the preloading period (data not shown).
thus these oocyte experiments demonstrated that
 xxxg2115xxx  is an organic anion exchanger that could be coupled to the na⫹ gradient through na⫹-dicarboxylate
cotransport.
es uptake in rat renal cortical slices. es is well
established to be an  xxxg2115xxx  (but not an oat1) substrate
(fig. 2) (9, 23, 46). thus, to determine whether transport on  xxxg2115xxx  was indeed indirectly coupled to na⫹ in
the kidney, we measured es accumulation in rat renal
cortical slices, a preparation that tracks basolateral
transport into the tubules (5, 54). figure 5 shows the
time course of 100 nm es accumulation by renal slices.
uptake was linear for ⱖ15 min and then appeared to
approach steady state during the subsequent 45 min.
uptake was clearly concentrative, e.g., tissue-to-medium ratios at 60 min were ⬃22. es accumulation was
markedly inhibited by 1 mm probenecid throughout
the time course. removal of na⫹ from the uptake
medium was as effective as probenecid in inhibiting es
uptake (fig. 5). because this result is consistent with
tertiary active, indirect coupling to na⫹, as previously
shown for oat1 (14, 49), the ability of externally applied ga to stimulate es uptake by the slices was

evaluated. external ga stimulated es accumulation
in a concentration-dependent manner, with peak stimulation at 20 ␮m ga (fig. 6a). this ga concentration
was used in all subsequent experiments. as in the
oocyte experiments shown above (figs. 2–4), 5 mm li⫹
and 1 mm ms (inhibitors of na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransport) significantly inhibited es uptake in the
presence of 20 ␮m ga, effectively reducing its accumulation to levels observed in the presence of 1 mm
probenecid. removal of na⫹ from the uptake buffer
(na⫹-free) was equally effective (fig. 6b).
na⫹ removal and probenecid did not completely inhibit concentrative es transport by renal slices. to
investigate the remaining component of transport further, tc was used as an inhibitor of es uptake (fig.
6c). tc is known to be a substrate for several oats,
including  xxxg2115xxx  and members of the organic aniontransporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ) family (1, 8, 20, 53).
tc reduced es uptake in a concentration-dependent
manner. at 100 ␮m, tc inhibited es uptake to a
greater extent than 1 mm probenecid or na⫹ removal
(fig. 6c). when applied together, 1 mm probenecid ⫹
100 ␮m tc reduced uptake to a greater extent than
probenecid alone, indicating the presence of a probenecid-insensitive, tc-sensitive component to es uptake
in renal slices.
discussion

understanding renal oat function at the molecular
level is essential to our ability to improve drug design,
delivery and therapeutic strategies and to understand
and intervene in disease progression.  xxxg2113xxx -mediated
transport has been implicated in the nephrotoxicity
associated with nucleoside phosphonate antiviral (adefovir and cidofovir) therapy (13, 14, 19). indeed, inhibition of active drug uptake into kidney proximal tubule cells via coadministration of an oat1 substrate
ajp-renal physiol • vol

may mitigate their nephrotoxicity without compromising their therapeutic value (29). oat function may also
be a key factor in the progression of disease resulting
from exposure to increased levels of toxic endogenous
or xenobiotic substances. during chronic renal failure,
uremic toxins accumulate in the blood, and recent
studies have shown that several uremic toxins are
transported by, or are inhibitors of,  xxxg2113xxx  and roat3
(15, 17, 30, 31). thus these transporters may control
the progression of nephrotoxicity as well as urinary
excretion of potentially toxic anionic drugs and metabolites.
categorizing the contributions of individual oat
family members to overall kidney transport function,
although clinically important, has been experimentally
difficult, because multiple transporter paralogs (i.e.,
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx ) are expressed in the
proximal tubule and appear to be responsible for renal
organic anion excretion. however, increased knowl-

 xxxg2115xxx  is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger

edge of individual oat specificity and subcellular localization is expanding our ability to interpret transport studies along these lines. for example, pah is
transported by oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx , but not by  xxxg2114xxx  or  xxxg2109xxx 
(9, 10, 23, 40, 41, 46, 49); renal transport of es is
mediated by  xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx , but not by oat1 or  xxxg2114xxx  (9,
10, 23, 40, 46); and tc is transported by  xxxg2115xxx , but not
by oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , or  xxxg2109xxx  (9, 10, 40, 46). thus, on the
basis of specificity,  xxxg2114xxx  should not play any role in the
renal transport of any of these three substrates.  xxxg2113xxx 
(45, 51) and, recently, mouse  xxxg2115xxx  (46) have been
localized to the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. in contrast,  xxxg2109xxx  has been observed
in the apical membrane (3). this suggests that transport of pah across the basolateral membrane of renal
proximal tubule cells (e.g., in renal cortical slices)
would be predominantly mediated by oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx 
and that, for the oats, uptake of es and tc would
serve as a measure of transport mediated solely by
 xxxg2115xxx . in agreement with this interpretation, when
expressed in x. laevis oocytes,  xxxg2113xxx  and roat3 transported pah (fig. 2) (23, 49). on the other hand, as
shown previously for oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx  (9, 23, 46), es is
transported by  xxxg2115xxx , but not by oat1 (fig. 2). thus, in
oocytes and renal slice [reflects only basolateral uptake
by the tubules (5, 54)], measurement of es transport
allows us to focus on  xxxg2115xxx -mediated events.
previous reports on  xxxg2115xxx  function in the x. laevis
oocyte expression system found no evidence for energetic coupling of transport to na⫹ or dicarboxylate
gradients (9, 23). in the present experiments, careful
control of imposed dicarboxylate gradients and coexpression of an na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter along
with  xxxg2115xxx  has revealed indirect coupling to na⫹. our
data clearly show that roat3-mediated uptake of pah
and es is markedly trans-stimulated by ga (figs. 2
and 3). this is precisely the behavior previously demonstrated for the basolateral organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger  xxxg2113xxx / xxxg2113xxx  (14, 49). in addition, similar to the trans-stimulatory effect of ga on  xxxg2113xxx /
 xxxg2113xxx , ga stimulation of roat3 uptake was
concentration dependent (data not shown), whereas
ms did not stimulate roat3 uptake (fig. 3). these
findings strongly suggest that  xxxg2115xxx , similar to oat1,
functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger
and could be energetically coupled to the na⫹ gradient
through an na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransporter that generates the dicarboxylate counterion gradient utilized
for organic anion exchange.
to directly test the indirect coupling hypothesis, es
uptake was measured in oocytes coexpressing rbnadc-1 and roat3 (fig. 4). again, preloading with ga
stimulated uptake. however, as expected for the coupled system, preloading in the presence of li⫹ or ms
(inhibitors of renal na⫹-ga cotransport) or removal of
na⫹ blocked stimulation by preventing uptake of ga
by rbnadc-1 during the preincubation step (fig. 4).
none of these treatments was inhibitory when applied
during es uptake (data not shown). thus, when ga
entry was prevented by inhibition of the na⫹-ga cotransporter, roat3-mediated es uptake was not stimajp-renal physiol • vol

ulated by external ga. these findings in x. laevis
oocytes demonstrate that roat3 (similar to oat1) is an
organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that can be
driven by indirect coupling to the na⫹ gradient.
the same indirect coupling mechanism was demonstrated for the  xxxg2115xxx  substrate es at the basolateral
membrane of proximal tubular cells. es uptake by rat
renal cortical slices in vitro was clearly na⫹ dependent
(fig. 5). moreover, as seen in roat3-expressing oocytes,
es uptake was stimulated by addition of external ga,
and this stimulation was prevented by li⫹, ms, and
probenecid and by na⫹ removal (fig. 6b). this pattern
of stimulation and inhibition is that expected for organic anion transport indirectly coupled to the na⫹
gradient through na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransport. it is
the same pattern seen previously for renal uptake of
the oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx  substrate pah (34, 35, 37, 49).
these experiments also demonstrate that  xxxg2115xxx  is not
the only transporter responsible for es uptake by rat
renal cortical slices. results from inhibition experiments using another  xxxg2115xxx  substrate, tc, indicate the
presence of an na⫹-independent, probenecid-insensitive organic anion transporter (i.e., non-oat). another
family of transporters,  xxxg2163xxx  (slc21a), mediate na⫹independent, probenecid-insensitive transport of es
and tc (1, 2, 8, 20, 21, 32). of these family members,
 xxxg2163xxx  is expressed on the apical membrane in the
kidney, whereas expression of  xxxg2164xxx , oatp3, and
oatp4 was not detected in the kidney (1, 4, 21, 24, 53).
the remaining member cloned thus far, oatp5, is
highly expressed in the kidney; however, it has not
been localized or functionally characterized (12, 24).
thus this residual transport activity may be attributable to oatp5.
in conclusion, we demonstrate here the first data
identifying the mechanism of organic anion uptake by
 xxxg2115xxx . when studied in the x. laevis oocyte expression
system or in rat renal cortical slices, roat3 proved to be
an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that could be
energetically coupled to the na⫹ gradient through
na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransport. thus, on the basis of
energetic considerations (not specificity), oat1 and
 xxxg2115xxx  appear to be indistinguishable. this conclusion
has important implications in several areas. first, it
will be important to reevaluate past conclusions concerning the relative roles of these two transporters
(and the other oats) in transport of endogenous metabolites, toxins, and therapeutic drugs and in drugdrug or drug-xenobiotic interactions. second, renal
transport of small organic anions (pah and fluorescein) is regulated by multiple signals, including hormones and protein kinases (27, 39, 55). because transport was na⫹ dependent, it was assumed that the
target of regulation was oat1. however, oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx 
appear to respond to protein kinase c activation (26,
50). thus, in light of the present findings, it will be
important to determine in intact renal tissue how signaling affects each of the transporters. finally, the
present results raise the following question: do other
members of the oat family of transporters utilize a
similar mechanism? although this question has not

 xxxg2115xxx  is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger

been addressed directly,  xxxg2114xxx , which appears to be
localized to the basolateral membrane in the kidney
and liver, transports dicarboxylates, suggesting that it
too may be an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger
(16, 40, 43). it remains to be demonstrated that this is
indeed the case.
