abstract
elevated plasma homocysteine is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (cad). although
there is general agreement on the importance of micronutrients and genetic predisposition to elevated plasma homocysteine, the
exact influence of the known prevalent mutations in genes which regulate homocysteine metabolism is not clear. we studied 376
cases of individuals with premature cad with respect to their fasting and post-methionine load (pml) total homocysteine (thcy)
concentrations. we also determined the presence or absence of the t833c and g919a mutations of the cystathionine-b-synthase
(cbs) gene, the c677t mutation of the methylene  xxxd3334xxx  reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene, and the a2756g transition of the b12
dependent  xxxg1479xxx  (ms) gene. our objectives were therefore both to confirm the relationship of plasma homocysteine
with premature cad and to examine the importance of genetic influence on both fasting and pml homocysteine. approximately
32% of the cad patients had fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and 16% had pml hyperhomocysteinemia. of these, 8.5% had both
forms of hyperhomocysteinemia (combined hyperhomocysteinemia). the t833c mutation in the cbs gene and the thermolabile
c677t mutation in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene seem to play an important role in the subset of individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia. the a2756g transition in the ms gene is not associated with elevated plasma thcy. many cases (47%) of hyperhomocysteinemia are not associated with micronutrient deficiencies, impaired renal function, and/or currently known genetic mutations.
further work is needed to study whether unknown mutations, particularly those residing in the intronic sequences of the genes
involved in homocysteine metabolism, other environmental factors, or interaction of gene, nutrient, and environmental factors
may be the cause of currently unexplained cases of mild hyperhomocysteinemia. © 1999 published by elsevier science ireland ltd.

atherosclerotic occlusive vascular disease and may explain, at least in part, the occurrence of coronary artery
disease (cad) in patients who do not have dyslipidemia, hypertension and other conventional risk factors. a large number of case-control and cross-sectional
studies [1,2] and several prospective studies [3– 5] have
demonstrated that mildly elevated plasma total homocysteine (thcy) measured during fasting is associated

with increased risk of occlusive vascular diseases. a
recent report indicates that plasma thcy concentration
is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with
angiographically confirmed cad [6].
the majority of epidemiological studies have focused
on fasting hyperhomocysteinemia. in addition, thcy
can be measured after methionine loading. presence of
an elevated thcy 2– 6 h after a dose of methionine is
known as post-methionine load (pml) hyperhomocysteinemia. early clinical studies [7 – 9] have shown that
obligate heterozygous relatives of patients with classic
homocystinuria due to cystathionine-b-synthase (cbs,
 xxxg350xxx ) deficiency are more likely to have pml
hyperhomocysteinemia than fasting hyperhomocysteinemia. preliminary results from the nhlbi family
heart study showed that pml and fasting hyperhomocysteinemia are independent of each other in the majority of individuals and that without methionine loading,
approximately 40% of the cases of elevated plasma
thcy could be missed [10]. more recently, the european
concerted action project studied 750 cases of atherosclerotic vascular disease and 800 controls with respect to
fasting and pml homocysteine and found that among
the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, 27% had only
pml hyperhomocysteinemia [2].
mild hyperhomocysteinemia, whether measured during fasting or after a methionine load, can be caused by
micronutrient deficiencies, such as insufficient folate,
 xxxd3049xxx , and  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  intake [11], and by impaired renal function [12]. genetic defects in either the
transsulfuration or the remethylation pathways of homocysteine metabolism have also been shown to predispose individuals to elevated plasma homocysteine.
in the transsulfuration pathway, presence of mutations in the cbs gene in the heterozygous carrier state
was thought to be the major cause of pml hyperhomocysteinemia [7,8]; however, two recent studies were
unable to confirm this hypothesis [13,14]. in the
remethylation pathway, a ‘thermolabile’ variant form
(c677t)
of
methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
( xxxg1475xxx ,  xxxg1475xxx ) has been reported to be more
prevalent in patients with cad (17%) than controls
(5%) [15,16]; however, recent reports indicate that homozygosity of this mutation is not associated with
increased risk of cad [17 – 21]. deficiency of b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx  (ms,  xxxg1479xxx ), an
enzyme which catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, may also result in hyperhomocysteinemia. recently, the gene coding for ms has been
cloned and sequenced, and several mutations of the ms
gene have been identified [22 – 25]. the one most prevalent mutation is that of the a2756g transition, resulting
in the substitution of  xxxd233xxx  by glycine [22].
in the current investigation, we studied a relatively
large number of patients with documented premature
cad and controls. we measured thcy levels during

fasting and 4 h pml and determined four common
mutations: the t833c and g919a transitions—the two
most prevalent mutations of the cbs gene [9,14,26–28];
the c677t mutation of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene; and the
a2756g mutation of the ms gene with the objective of
(1) to examine the relationships between plasma thcy
levels and premature cad; and (2) to determine the
importance of genetic influence on plasma thcy levels,
both during fasting and 4 h pml.

2. material and methods

2.1. subjects
we studied 376 patients (297 males ranging in age
from 27 to 65 years, mean age 48.7 years; and 79
females ranging in age from 36 to 62 years, mean age
48.4 years) with premature cad as documented by
angiographically-proven atherosclerosis, and/or one or
more episodes of myocardial infarction or coronary
artery bypass surgery before the age of 55 years. for
the control group, we concurrently recruited 82 apparently healthy individuals, most of whom were either
present or past employees of the fairview-university
medical center (39 males ranging in age from 25 to 69
years, mean age 44.4 years; and 43 females ranging in
age from 25 to 72 years, mean age 46.4 years). serum
creatinine concentrations were determined on all hyperhomocysteinemic individuals, and plasma fasting and
pml thcy, plasma  xxxd3049xxx , serum  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx , red
cell folate were determined on all patients and controls.
dna was obtained from all individuals for mutation
studies.
patients and controls were of mixed ancestry common to the upper midwestern region of the us and
belonged to no particular ethnic group. this study was
approved by the human studies committee of the
university of minnesota institutional review board,
and all subjects gave informed consent.

2.2. fasting and post-methioine load total
homocysteine, b 6itamin and creatinine assays
fasting blood samples were drawn and separated
within 12 h for the measurements of baseline thcy,
vitamins b6, b12, red cell folate, and serum creatinine.
methionine (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered
orally and a second blood sample was collected 4 h
after loading for the determination of pml thcy.
both pre- and pml plasma samples were assayed for
thcy concentrations as previously described [9].
 xxxd3049xxx  was measured in plasma by a radioenzymatic assay (american laboratory products company,
ltd. windham, nh).  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  was determined in

cad patients with and without hyperhomocysteinemia. the f-test was used to determine if there were
differences in homocysteine concentrations between the
various genotypes. all statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis system (sas) version 6.6 [30].

2.3. mutation analysis

3. results

genomic dna was extracted from peripheral leukocytes isolated from acid-citrate-dextrose-anticoagulated
blood using a commercially available dna isolation kit
(puregene, gentra systems, minneapolis, mn).
we used digestion by the restriction enzymes bsr i
and alu i to detect the presence or absence of the t833c
and g919a mutations of the cbs gene, respectively [9].
the c677t mutation of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene was detected
by the use of hinf i, as described by rozen and
associates [16]. the a2756g mutation/polymorphism of
the ms gene was detected using hae iii restriction
analysis [22]. all digestion products were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and silver
stained.

2.4. statistical analysis
fasting thcy, pml thcy, and pml rise in thcy had
a skewed distribution; therefore, these variables were
natural log transformed and geometric means were
used. fasting and pml hyperhomocysteinemia were
defined based on the 90th percentile cut-off of the
control population [12]. pml hyperhomocysteinemia
was defined based on the rise in thcy levels above
fasting thcy levels. we used the rise (calculated as the
difference between the fasting and 4 hr pml thcy
concentrations) because the rise in thcy is independent
of fasting thcy levels, unlike the absolute pml thcy
level which can be confounded by an elevated fasting
thcy level [29]. individuals with both fasting and pml
hyperhomocysteinemia were classified as having combined hyperhomocysteinemia. odds ratios (or) and
95% confidence intervals (ci) were calculated to estimate the relative risk of fasting and/or pml hyperhomocysteinemia. low b vitamin levels were defined
based on the 10th percentile cut-off for all individuals
with normal thcy levels. age- and sex-adjusted geometric mean thcy levels and 95% ci were calculated for
the purpose of comparison between patients and controls. the differences in plasma thcy levels between
patients and controls were then tested for significance
with the student’s t-test for continuous variables. we
used the student’s unpaired t-test to determine whether
the prevalence of mutations (t833c in the cbs gene,
c677t in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene and a2756g in the ms gene)
differed between patients and controls and also between

fig. 1 compares the concentrations of plasma fasting
and pml rise in thcy concentration after adjustment
for age and gender on 82 apparently healthy controls
and 376 patients with premature cad. the mean
geometric fasting thcy concentration in cad patients
(9.7 mmol/l; 95% ci, 9.3–10.2 mmol/l) was significantly
(p =0.007) higher than the mean concentration in controls (8.7 mmol/l; 95% ci, 7.9–9.5 mmol/l). the mean
pml rise in thcy concentration in cad patients (22.3
mmol/l; 95% ci, 21.3–23.4 mmol/l) was also higher than
the mean concentration in controls (21.4 mmol/l; 95%
ci, 19.4–23.6 mmol/l); however, this difference did not
reach statistical significance.
elevated thcy levels were defined based on the 90th
percentile of the control population (fasting thcy:
males ] 12 mmol/l and females ]11 mmol/l; pml rise
in thcy: males ] 30 mmol/l and females, ] 31 mmol/l).
elevated fasting thcy concentrations were identified in
119 (31.6%) of the cad patients and 8 (9.8%) of the
controls; elevated pml rise in thcy levels were identified in 59 (15.7%) of the cad patients and 8 (9.8%) of
the controls. the corresponding or were 4.3 (95% ci,
2.0–9.2) for elevated fasting thcy and 1.7 (95% ci,
0.8–3.7) for elevated pml rise in thcy levels. thirtytwo (8.5%) of the cad patients had both elevated
fasting thcy and rise in pml thcy values as compared
to 3 (3.7%) of the control population (or 2.4 (95% ci,
0.7–8.2)).

thcy levels for controls and cad patients. while distributions of plasma homocysteine levels were skewed for

we studied known prevalent mutations (t833c and
g919a in the cbs gene, c677t in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene,
and a2756g in the ms gene) in cad patients and in
controls (table 1). as shown, there was no significant
difference in prevalence of these mutations between
patients and controls.

two individuals were heterozygous carriers of the
t833c mutation of the cbs gene. the mean fasting
thcy concentration of these 2 patients (17.1 mmol/l) was
significantly (pb0.001) higher compared to that of
individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele (9.4
mmol/l). likewise, the mean pml rise in thcy concentration of these two individuals (54.6 mmol/l) was significantly (pb 0.001) greater than that of individuals
homozygous for the wild-type allele (21.7 mmol/l).
for the c677t mutation in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene, geometric mean levels of fasting and pml rise in thcy
were highest among the individuals homozygous for the
c677t mutation and lowest among the individuals homozygous for the wild-type (c/c) allele. however,
these differences did not reach statistical significance.
likewise, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean fasting and pml rise in thcy concentration in individuals with the a/a, a/g, and g/g
genotypes of the a2756g mutation of the ms gene.

patients and controls with normal plasma thcy and
those with fasting, pml, or both forms of hyperhomocysteinemia (combined hyperhomocysteinemia).
two patients (one male, one female) with premature
cad who had combined hyperhomocysteinemia were
heterozygous for the t833c transition. the prevalence
of this mutation was significantly higher in individuals
with combined hyperhomocysteinemia (5.7%, pb
0.0001) as compared to individuals with normal thcy
(0%).
the prevalence of the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation in
the homozygous form was slightly increased in individuals with fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and decreased
in individuals with pml hyperhomocysteinemia as

compared to individuals with normal thcy, but neither
of these differences reached statistical significance.
however, homozygosity of the c677t mutation was
present in a significantly (p b0.05) larger percentage
(22.8%) of individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia as compared to normohomocysteinemic individuals (10.7%) or individuals with fasting (10.9%) or
pml (6.2%) hyperhomocysteinemia.
the a2756g mutation/polymorphism of the ms gene
was not associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. the
presence of the a/g and g/g genotypes was decreased
in individuals with the different forms of hyperhomocysteinemia as compared to individuals with normal
homocysteine levels, although none of these differences
reached statistical significance.

3.5. association of total homocysteine le6els with
genetic, renal, and/or micronutrient deficiencies
fig. 3 shows the presence of genetic, renal, and/or
micronutrient deficiencies in the combined population
of individuals with each of the three forms of hyperhomocysteinemia. genetic defects include heterozygosity
of the t833c mutation in the cbs gene and/or homozygosity of the c677t mutation in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene.
the a2756g mutation/polymorphism was not included
because of our finding that it was not associated with
hyperhomocysteinemia. low b vitamin concentration(s) as a potential cause of elevated plasma homocysteine in the hyperhomocysteinemic group was
defined as having one or more vitamin level(s) below
the 10th percentile of individuals with normal thcy
levels (folate b255 nmol/l, b12 b256 pmol/l, and b6
b 23 nmol/l). we used a serum creatinine concentration
of \1.4 mg/dl as the cut-off for possible impaired
renal function.
as shown, 10 of the 92 individuals (10.9%) with
fasting hyperhomocysteinemia were homozygous for

the c677t mutation. approximately 50% of the patients
had low b vitamin(s) and/or impaired renal function
while 41 (44.6%) had none of these risk factors.of the
32 individuals with pml hyperhomocysteinemia, 2
(6.2%) were homozygous for the c677t mutation, and 7
(21.9%) had low b vitamin(s). these risk factors were
not found in 24 of the 32 individuals (75.0%) with pml
hyperhomocysteinemia.
genetic influences were most significant in the group
of individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia.
two of the 35 individuals (5.7%) were heterozygous for
the t833c mutation, and 7 (20.0%) were homozygous
for the c677t mutation. of the 35 individuals, 20
(57.1%) had low b vitamin(s) and/or impaired renal
function. these risk factors were not found in 10 of the
35
individuals
(28.6%)
with
combined
hyperhomocysteinemia.

4. discussion
most large epidemiological studies of homocysteine
metabolism in cad patients have measured thcy only
in the fasting state. of the clinical studies which used
post-methionine loading, relatively small numbers of
patients were involved. since these studies include patients with different vascular diseases, even smaller
numbers of patients studied had documented cad.
the current investigation of 376 patients represents
one of the largest studies of both fasting and pml
homocysteine patients with documented cad. in our
study, 39% of the cad patients had elevated plasma
thcy. of those 39%, 81.5% had fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and 40.4% had pml hyperhomocysteinemia.
combined (both fasting and pml) hyperhomocysteinemia was present in 21.9% of these individuals. our
findings support previous reports that patients with
cad are more likely to have elevated plasma homocys-

teine. more importantly, our study confirms recent
findings that measurement of both fasting and pml
homocysteine is important in identifying elevated homocysteine in 27–40% of individuals [2,10]. although
the distribution of fasting and pml thcy levels was
skewed in both cases and controls, the cases have a
much more pronounced skew to the right, indicating
that there may be a dose-response effect between thcy
and risk to cad.
the etiologies of elevated plasma thcy either during
fasting or pml have been attributed to defects in either
the transsulfuration or the remethylation pathways.
thus mutations in cbs,  xxxg1475xxx , and ms genes or
deficiencies in the b vitamins are generally thought to
be responsible for elevated thcy. to understand the
genetic etiologies of both fasting and pml hyperhomocysteinemia, we studied the prevalence of known major
mutations in the cbs,  xxxg1475xxx , and ms genes and
also documented the levels of b vitamins.
since the frequency of homocystinuria in the us due
to cbs enzyme deficiency is estimated to be about
1:400,000, approximately 1:300 individuals in the general population may be expected to be heterozygous
carriers of cbs mutant alleles. the two most prevalent
mutations of the cbs gene are the t833c and g919a
transitions [14,26–28]. in our own study [9], these two
mutations account for about 50% of mutant alleles in
the mixed us population. thus, assuming the t833c
allele in this study represents 50% of all mutant cbs
alleles, our finding of two carriers of the t833c allele in
376 cad patients suggests that the estimated frequency
of heterozygous carriers of cbs mutant alleles in our
population of cad patients is about 1% (4/376). this
result has been confirmed in another large epidemiological study where 0.7% of the cad patients were heterozygous carriers of the t833c mutation [31]. thus,
these studies suggest that heterozygous carriers of these

mutations may be increased by several fold in patients
with cad as compared to the general population.
however, heterozygosity for mutations found in patients with classic cbs-deficient homocystinuria is most
likely
not
the
major
cause
of
pml
hyperhomocysteinemia.
our studies of the c677t (thermolabile) mutation of
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene show that the frequency of individuals homozygous for this mutation is not increased in
patients with premature cad (10.6%) as compared to
controls (14.6%), a finding which is in agreement with
recent publications [17–21]. the prevalence of this mutation in homozygous form is increased in the subset of
individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia compared to individuals with either normal or elevated
fasting or pml thcy levels. these results confirm a
previous report on a relatively smaller number of patients [32].
while ms plays a major role in homocysteine
metabolism, there has only been recent interest in the
role of this enzyme in causing mild hyperhomocysteinemia. several mutations/polymorphisms have been reported, but only the a2756g transition is relatively
prevalent [22–25]. our study showed that the presence
of this mutation, either in the heterozygous or in the
homozygous form, is not over-represented in individuals with any one of the three forms of
hyperhomocysteinemia.
in conclusion, the present study of a relatively large
number of patients with premature cad confirms previous studies that both fasting and pml hyperhomocysteinemia are present in excess in patients with
premature cad. our study of known prevalent mutations in three genes showed that genetic influence is
most pronounced in individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia, suggesting that this form of hyperhomocysteinemia may be metabolically distinct from

fig. 3. presence of genetic, renal and/or micronutrient deficiencies in cad patients with hyperhomocysteinemia who were heterozygous for t833c
(a), homozygous for c677t (d), homozygous for c677t and have ] 1 b vitamins below the 10th percentile (d), have ] 1 b vitamins below the
10th percentile ( ), have ] 1 b vitamins below the 10th percentile and creatinine ]1.4 mg/dl (a), have creatinine ] 1.4 mg/dl (a), and have
no known risk factors for hyperhomocysteinemia ( ).

hyperhomocysteinemia manifested only during fasting
or pml. in an attempt to unravel the specific etiologies
of the various forms of hyperhomocysteinemia, we also
studied b vitamins and serum creatinine in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals. we used vitamin levels below
the 10th percentile of individuals with normal thcy and
serum creatinine concentrations of \1.4 mg/dl in addition to homozygosity for the c677t transition in the
 xxxg1475xxx  gene and heterozygosity of the t833c transition in the cbs gene as potential etiologies for elevated
plasma homocysteine. while the presence of these risk
factors may or may not be sufficient by themselves to
cause elevated homocysteine, it is noteworthy that overall, 47% of the individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine did not have any of the risk factors studied
here.
we speculate that the etiology of elevated plasma
homocysteine, whether fasting, or pml, may be multifactorial. the interplay between mild mutation and
vitamin level has been exemplified by the c677t mutation of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene and folate concentration [33].
other mutations which may predispose individuals to
hyperhomocysteinemia in the presence of low vitamin
levels may exist in the three genes coding for enzymes
involved in homocysteine metabolism. given the strong
influence of genetic predisposition to hyperhomocysteinemia documented in twins [34], more studies are
needed to search for these mutations, in both the exons
and introns of the cbs, ms and  xxxg1475xxx  genes, which
may either qualitatively or quantitatively affect the
expression of these genes. thus, further studies of the
genetic predisposition to hyperhomocysteinemia and
gene/vitamin interaction are needed to give us a better
understanding of the etiology of fasting and pml
hyperhomocysteinemia.
