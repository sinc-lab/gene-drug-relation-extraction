abstract

aripiprazole, a quinolinone derivative, is a new dopaminergic agent which has been recently developed and demonstrated to be
clinically useful as an antipsychotic drug with reduced extrapyramidal motor side effects. here, we found that aripiprazole competed
[3h]spiperone binding with a 100-fold higher affinity than [3h]sch23390 binding, and inhibited the quinpirole-induced facilitation of
high-affinity gtpase activity in rat striatal membranes. the effects of chronic administration of aripiprazole and haloperidol on dopamine
d 2 receptor binding and mrna level in rat striata were examined by a [3h]spiperone binding assay and a ribonuclease protection assay.
haloperidol induced a significant rise in bmax of [3h]spiperone binding at 1 mg/kg and in the level of dopamine d2l receptor mrna at
4 mg/kg. a high dose of aripiprazole (100 mg/kg) only tended to increase the bm~x of [3h]spiperone binding non-significantly, and had
no effect on the level of dopamine d2l receptor mrna. these results indicated that aripiprazole had an antagonistic activity to dopamine
d~ receptors with a high affinity, but that the potency of aripiprazole to up-regulate dopamine d. receptors in the striatum was much
smaller than that of haloperidol. this small up-regulation may be related to the ability of aripiprazole to act without side effects including
tardive dyskinesia.

1. introduction

antipsychotic drugs have been used effectively in ameliorating some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. however, they simultaneously induce serious extrapyramidal
side effects as well as hyperprolactinemia (levinson, 1991;
meltzer, 1991). it is now necessary to elucidate the mechanisms by which antipsychotic drugs exert their therapeutic
effects and side effects, which will guide the design of the
ideal drugs that will direct one disorder without affecting
the other. antipsychotic drugs can be loosely divided into

two categories, i.e., typical drugs which are associated
with extrapyramidal side effects, and atypical drugs which
are less associated with these side effects. buckland et al.
(1993a,b) have investigated the effects of the typical and
atypical antipsychotic drugs on dopaminergic systems in
the rat central nervous system, and suggested that distinct
dopamine receptor subtypes may be associated with the
therapeutic or side effect of antipsychotic drugs.
the dopaminergic system is known to be associated
with cognitive, emotive, motor and endocrine functions. a
recent development in molecular biology concerning
dopamine receptors indicates multiple dopamine receptor
subtypes generated from at least 5 distinct dopamine receptor genes (d~. d 2, d 3, d 4 and d 5 receptor, sibley and
monsma, 1992; strange, 1993; o'dowd, 1993). the two
isoforms of the d e receptor mrna, called dzl and dzs
receptor mrna, were identified as generated by alterna-

rive splicing (bunzow et al., 1988: giros et al., 1989).
binding techniques and studies of determination of their
mrna location revealed that some of them are preferentially distributed in the limbic area of the brain, which
suggested that they are involved in mental illness. indeed,
dopamine receptors have been thought to be the primary
targets in the medical treatment of schizophrenia.
aripiprazole, a quinolinone derivative ( xxxd221xxx , 7[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)- 1-piperazinyl] butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(ih)-quinolinone), is a new dopaminergic agent
which has both a dopamine autoreceptor agonistic activity
and a postsynaptic d 2 receptor antagonistic activity (fig.
1. kikuchi et al., 1995: semba et al., 1995). it was
developed as an effective antipsychotic agent without extrapyramidal side effects in consideration of the following
two points: (1) the clinically effective doses of the conventional antipsychotic drugs in treating psychosis correlate
remarkably well with their affinity for binding to block the
postsynaptic d~ receptor (seeman et al., 1976) and (2)
dopamine autoreceptor agonists are suggested as antipsychotic drug candidates devoid of the motor disturbances
associated with the conventional antipsychotic drugs (clark
et al., 1982). aripiprazole has recently been demonstrated
to be clinically useful to alleviate both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia with reduced side effects
(toru et al., 1994), and in animal behavioral studies,
aripiprazole showed weak cataleptogenic effects in spite of
strong postsynaptic d, receptor antagonistic activity as
compared with chlorpromazine and haloperidol (kikuchi et
al., 1995).
the ultimate aim of the present study was to understand
the clinical mechanisms of aripiprazole in the treatment of
schizophrenic patients without extrapyramidal side effects.
we first investigated the effects of aripiprazole on the
binding activity to dopamine receptors and on the high-affinity gtpase activity in the rat brain striatal membranes
in vitro. then, since the therapeutic action of antipsychotic
drugs takes a much longer time to develop, the effects of
chronic treatment of aripiprazole on the dopamine receptor
binding activities and on the levels of d: receptor mrna
in the rat brain striatum were also investigated using a
radioligand binding experiment and a sensitive and specific ribonuclease protection assay. the effects of a typical
antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, were also investigated.

other drugs were purchased from nacalai tesque (kyoto,

2.2. drug treatment of animals
male wistar rats (200-300 g) were housed in a 12 h
light-dark cycle with free access to food and water at 25°c.
they were orally administered 1, 2, or 4 m g / k g / d a y
haloperidol, 12 or 100 m g / k g aripiprazole, or vehicle (5%
arabic gum-saline) once a day for 21 days in a volume of 1
ml/kg. rats were decapitated 3 days after the last injection, and the striatum from each rat was immediately
removed and used for dopamine receptor binding experiments and the measurement of gtpase activity. for the
mrna determination, rats were decapitated on the day 6 h
after the last injection.
2.3. binding experiments for d i- and d,-like receptors in
the rat brain striatal membranes
membrane preparations and binding experiments were
performed as described earlier (zhang et al., 1990). the
striatum was homogenized in 10 vols. of 50 mm tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4) and then centrifuged at 49000 × g for 10
rain. the pellet was washed once with 50 mm tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kc1, 2
mm caci~. and 1 mm mgci, and resuspended in the
same buffer to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.
[3h]sch23390 and [3h]spiperone were used as radioligands for the binding experiments of dj- and dmike
receptors, respectively. after striatal membranes were incubated with each radioligand [or 30 min at 37°c, the
reaction mixture was rapidly filtered under vacuum through
g f / b glass-fiber filters (whatman int.. maidstone. uk)
with five 2-ml rinses with ice-cold 50 mm tris-hci buffer
(ph 7.4). in both binding experiments of d 1- and d2-1ike
receptors, the specific binding was defined as the excess
over the non-specific binding taken in the presence of
(+)-butaclamol (2 ixm). the protein concentration was
determined according to the method of lowry et al. ( 1951 ).

pellet was washed once with 10 ml of 10 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), containing 0.1 mm edta and 5 mm dithiothreitol and resuspended in the same buffer to a protein
concentration of 0. 1-0.2 m g / m l . the reaction mixture (80

approximately 70000 cpm of [3,-32p]gtp, drugs to be
tested and 20 ~1 of the membrane suspension was incubated at 37°c for 15 rain. the reaction was terminated by
adding 0.9 ml of 5% charcoal prewashed with 6.7 mm
phosphoric acid (ph 2.3). after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000 x g
for 20 rain, radioactivity of 500 ~1 of the supernatant was
measured as the 33pi release from [~,_32p]gtp indicating
gtpase activity. high-affinity (low k m) gtpase activity
was calculated by subtracting gtpase activities in the
presence of 50 ~m gtp from that in the presence of 0.1
p,m gtp.

2.5. determination o[" mrna of d2£ and d:s receptor in
the rat brain striatum
determination of mrna of d2l and d 2 s receptor in the
rat striatum was performed as described by inoue et al.
(1994).

2.5.1. preparation o/" rna and radiolabelled antisense
crna probe
total rna was isolated from the striatum according to
the method of chomczynski and sacchi (1987). the two
template cdnas prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were one which contained the region
corresponding to a segment extending from base 541 in the
second extracellular loop to base 1227 in the third extracellular loop of the rat d2l receptor (pd2(1/2)), defined a
fragment of 673 bases for d2l receptor and a fragment of
410 bases for d2s receptor (fig. 2, inoue et al., 1994) and
the other which contained the fourth exon of the rat
13-actin (pac), defined a fragment of 310 bases.

units of rnase-free dnase were added to the reaction
mixture, and further incubation was carried out for 15 rain
at 37°c. labelled rna was precipitated after extraction
with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1).

2.5.2. ribonuclease protection a s s a y
approximately 100000 cpm and 10000 cpm of the
radiolabelled antisense rna probes for d~ receptor and
[3-actin, respectively, were added to 10 p,g of total rna to
be tested in the hybridization buffer composed of 40 mm
pipes (ph 6.4), 1 mm edta, 0.4 m  xxxg2020xxx  and 80%
formamide in a total volume of 30 ~1. the hybridization
was perlbrmed at 45°c for 12 h. after incubation, 40
# g / m l  xxxg1963xxx  in 350 ill of rnase digestion buffer
composed of 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 5 mm edta and
300 mm naci was added to the mixture. digestion was
carried out for 60 rain at 30°c. 20 ~1 of 10% sds and 5
~1 of 10 m g / m l proteinase k were added, and further
incubation was carried out for 15 rain at 37°c. after
extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1), hybridized rna with 10 ~,g yeast transfer rna
was precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70c~ ethanol
once and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel. after completion of the electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. alternatively, the dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate to
analyze the intensity of each band by bas2000 bioimaging analyzer (fuji film, tokyo, japan).
2.6. statistics
data are expressed as mean + s.e.m. effects of drug
treatments in binding studies and in mrna measurements
were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with
pairwise comparison by bonferroni method. in measuring
gtpase activities, statistical comparison was carried out
using the student's t-test compared to the value in the
presence of the corresponding dose of quinpirole. the
difference was considered to be significant when the p
value was less than 0.05.

which corresponds to the third intracellular loop containing
the additional sequences existing in the d2l isoform
(bunzow et al., 1988; giros et al., 1989), the d2l and d2s
isoforms can be distinctively identified in the same sample
simultaneously. the band for d2l migrates at the position
corresponding to 673 bases, and the band of d2s migrates
at the position corresponding to 410 bases. the band for
[3-actin used as an internal standard migrates at the position corresponding to 310 bases. to assess the ability of
 xxxg1963xxx  to degrade non-hybridized rna and the specificity of the probes, a blank assay using yeast transfer
rna in place of sample rna was performed. we observed no protected band in the blank assay, indicating that
the radiolabelled probe is specifically hybridized with respective mrna and fully degraded by  xxxg1963xxx  in the
blank assay (data not shown). to quantify and compare the
level of mrna, the relationship of d 2 receptor mrna
signals and those of [3-actin mrna was verified. as
shown in fig. 5b, the band intensities for each mrna
were increased in proportion to the increasing amount of
total rna used, and the ratio of band intensities for d2l
and d=s receptor mrnas relative to those of 13-actin
mrna was almost constant in the range of the amounts of
total rna used (fig. 5a).

4. discussion

we demonstrated that aripiprazole (1) competed for
spiperone binding sites with a high affinity, (2) had a
100-fold higher affinity for spiperone than for sch23390
and (3) inhibited quinpirole-evoked facilitation of high-affinity gtpase activity in the rat striatum. these findings
indicate that aripiprazole has a selective antagonistic activity for d2-1ike receptor subfamilies over de-like receptors
in the striatum, which is the case in conventional antipsychotic drugs (creese et al., 1976; seeman et al., 1976;
farde et al., 1989; wiesel et al., 1990). since therapeutic
efficacy can be achieved after several weeks of administration of antipsychotics, we determined the effects of repeated administration of aripiprazole on d2-1ike receptor
activity in rats.
the chronic administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg), a
typical antipsychotic drug, significantly increased the maximal numbers of [3h]spiperone binding in the rat striatum.
aripiprazole only tended to increase the bm~x of
[3h]spiperone binding, even at the high dose of 100
m g / k g . thus, the potency of up-regulation of d 2 receptors by aripiprazole seems to have been weaker than that
by haloperidol in the striatum. this result is consistent
with previous behavioral results in rat models. chronic
treatment with aripiprazole in rats induced supersensitization to apomorphine measured as stereotyped behaviors,
but its efficacy and duration were smaller than those with
chronic treatment of haloperidol (kikuchi et al., 1995).
the doses of i m g / k g of haloperidol and 12 m g / k g of
aripiprazole are twice the eds0 to inhibit the stereotyped
behavior induced by apomorphine, and the dose of 100
m g / k g of aripiprazole was the high dose that would evoke
catalepsy in 75% of the treated rats (kikuchi et al., 1995).
it is difficult to pharmacologically distinguish d2-1ike
receptors as d 2, d 3 and d 4 receptors by the binding
experiment using [3h]spiperone as a ligand, because
spiperone has fairly high affinities for each d2-1ike receptor subtype (strange, 1993). in order to specifically determine the effect of drugs on d 2 receptors in the present
study, the mrna for this receptor was analyzed. the level
of mrna is thought to directly reflect the rate of receptor
synthesis. the rate of synthesis of a receptor may be an
important factor when studying the effects of a drug at the
molecular level when there is a high level of receptor
turnover due to high levels of a ligand. therefore, we also
investigated the effects of chronic treatment of drugs on
the levels of the d 2 receptor mrna in the rat striatum.
two isoforms are known to be generated by alternative

splicing in the rat brain (d2l and d2s, giros et al., 1989;
monsma et al., 1989). it is possible to determine both dzl
and d2s mrna simultaneously in the same sample by a
sensitive and specific ribonuclease protection assay with
the crna probe we used. chronic treatment with haloperidol (4 m g / k g ) elicited a small but significant increase
(21%) in the level of d2l mrna, suggesting that the
increase in the maximal binding by haloperidol was partly
the result of an increase in d2l mrna. a similar up-regulation of d 2 receptor mrna was reported by a number of
groups, but the magnitude of increase differed among one
another (le moine et al., 1990; giros et al., 1989; buckland et al., 1992, 1993a,b; rogue et al., 1991; etc.). in the
present study, the percent change in bin,x (40%) was not
similar to that in the level of mrna (21%), and the dose
of haloperidol (4 m g / k g ) that could increase the level of
dzl receptor mrna was more than that (1 m g / k g ) to
increase bm,~x. these results suggest that the regulation of
do receptors following haloperidol occurs not only by
mrna transcription but also by one or more processes
such as translation, transport, insertion, internalization and
degradation. furthermore, the effect on the stability of
mrna, which is degraded soon after it is used for protein
synthesis, may be involved in the change of the mrna
level. haloperidol had no apparent effect on d2s mrna.
buckland et al. (1993a) reported that haloperidol increased
both d2l and d2s receptor mrna in the rat brain. although the reason for these discrepancies is unclear, variations in experimental protocol, such as differential drug
doses, time period of administration, drug administration
route, differences in dissection of brain regions and so on
may be causal factors. in our protocol, the change of d2s
receptor mrna may be too small to detect at this time
course, even by a ribonuclease protection assay. since d2l
is the predominant form in the rat striatum (giros et al.,
1989), the  xxxd1876xxx  receptor may have more plasticity than
does the d2s form to antipsychotic drugs. rogue et al.
(1991) reported rather similar magnitudes of increase in
both total d~ and d21- receptor mrnas in a northern blot
analysis.
in contrast, the chronic treatment of aripiprazole in the
present study had no effect on del and d2s mrna.
treatments with the atypical antipsychotic drugs sulpiride
and clozapine were reported to up-regulate the rat brain d 3
receptor mrna level without affecting the d~ or d 2
receptor mrna level, while the typical antipsychotic drugs
haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx  up-regulated d~, d 2 and d 3
receptor mrna levels in the rat brain, suggesting that the
up-regulation of d 3 receptor mrna may be associated
with the therapeutic action of antipsychotic drugs (buckland et al., 1992, 1993b). our present results also indicate
that the up-regulation of d e receptors may be associated
with the occurrence of side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia) but not the clinical mode of action of antipsychotics.
the finding that clinically aripiprazole has reduced extrapyramidal side effects may reflect the small potency of

a. lnoue et al. / european journal o['pharmacology 321 (1997) 105-111

aripiprazole to up-regulate d 2 receptors in the striatum.
aripiprazole has been demonstrated to have fairly high
affinities for both d 2 and d 3 receptors; the effects of
aripiprazole on d 3 receptors and the mechanisms of its
therapeutic action remain to be determined.
