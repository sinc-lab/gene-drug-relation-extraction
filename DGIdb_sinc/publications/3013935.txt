inhibition by human  xxxg2277xxx  of  xxxg741xxx -mediated cleavage of prothrombin.  human  xxxg2277xxx  significantly inhibited the rate of prothrombin conversion to thrombin by  xxxg741xxx  in the presence of phospholipid or platelets, calcium, and  xxxg749xxx . sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125i-prothrombin activation revealed that  xxxg2277xxx  reduced the rate of prothrombin activation but did not alter the cleavage pattern. the inhibition was reversed by the inclusion of a highly specific rabbit antithrombomodulin antibody. if  xxxg2277xxx  was replaced by hirudin, the rate of thrombin generation was not decreased excluding the possibility that the inhibition by  xxxg2277xxx  was secondary to the binding of small amounts of thrombin formed early in the reaction and the prevention of feedback breakdown of prothrombin by thrombin. the inhibitory activity of  xxxg2277xxx  was overcome by increasing the concentration of  xxxg741xxx  and specific, saturable binding of  xxxg2277xxx  to  xxxg741xxx  was demonstrated. these results indicate that  xxxg2277xxx  binds to  xxxg741xxx  and thereby inhibits the activity of the  xxxg741xxx  complex.
