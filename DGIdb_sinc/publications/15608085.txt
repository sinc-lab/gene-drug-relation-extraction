phenylpropanolamine (dl-norephedrine) was one of the
most widely used therapeutic agents to act by modulating the
sympathetic nervous system. first synthesized in 1912,
phenylpropanolamine was introduced as a  xxxd2565xxx  in the 1930s (lasanga, 1988). its therapeutic use, therefore, predated major discoveries in sympathetic neurophysiology, including the identification of the neurotransmitter
norepinephrine (von euler, 1946, cited in lasanga, 1988),
and the concept of adrenoceptors (ahlquist, 1948, cited in
lasanga, 1988). because of concerns regarding episodes of
stroke in individuals ingesting phenylpropanolamine, it was
withdrawn as a therapeutic agent in 2000 (kernan et al.,
2000).
an early report suggested that phenylpropanolamine may
possess a cardiac-specific, indirect activity to release norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves (trendelenburg et al.,
1962). however, subsequent studies demonstrated that the

man veins, but not mesenteric arteries. the lack of constriction
to uk14,304 was also observed in endothelium-denuded
mesenteric arteries. phenylpropanolamine constricted both
types of artery but was 62-fold more potent in tail arteries.
in mesenteric arteries, constriction to phenylpropanolamine
was not affected by the selective ␣2-adrenergic antagonist,
rauwolscine (10⫺7 m) but was abolished by the selective
␣1-adrenergic antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m). in contrast,
constriction to phenylpropanolamine in tail arteries and in human veins was inhibited by rauwolscine but not  xxxd3000xxx .
therefore, phenylpropanolamine is a preferential ␣2-adrenergic
agonist. at low concentrations, it constricts blood vessels that
express functional ␣2-adrenoceptors, whereas at much higher
concentrations, phenylpropanolamine also activates vascular
␣1-adrenoceptors. this action likely contributed to phenylpropanolamine’s therapeutic activity, namely constriction of the
nasal vasculature.

cardiovascular effects of phenylpropanolamine result from
direct activation of adrenoceptors (e.g., moya-huff and maher, 1987; hricik and johnson, 1996). phenylpropanolamine
can inhibit the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine, although
this property plays only a minor role in its cardiovascular
effects (hricik and johnson, 1996). phenylpropanolamine
binds to all three subtypes of ␣1-adrenoceptors (␣1a, ␣1b, and
␣1d) with relatively low affinity (buckner et al., 2002) and
functions as a low-efficacy agonist at these receptors (minneman et al., 1983; minneman and johnson, 1984; fox et al.,
1985; alberts et al., 1999; nishimatsu et al., 1999; buckner et
al., 2002). it has minimal activity at ␤-adrenoceptors (moyahuff and maher, 1987; hull et al., 1993) and is therefore
considered a selective ␣-adrenergic agonist. although often
described as an ␣1-adrenergic agonist, phenylpropanolamine
binds to ␣2-adrenoceptors with approximately 35-fold higher
affinity compared with ␣1-adrenoceptors and may be an efficacious agonist at these receptors (buckner et al., 2002).
␣1- and ␣2-adrenoceptors are both expressed on vascular
smooth muscle cells and initiate vasoconstriction (guimaraes
and moura, 2001). although ␣1-adrenoceptors are expressed

abstract
phenylpropanolamine (dl-norephedrine) was one of the most
widely used therapeutic agents to act on the sympathetic nervous system. because of concerns regarding incidents of
stroke, its use as a  xxxd2565xxx  was discontinued.
although considered an ␣1-adrenergic agonist, the vascular
adrenergic pharmacology of phenylpropanolamine was not
fully characterized. unlike most other circulations, the vasculature of the nasal mucosa is highly enriched with constrictor
␣2-adrenoceptors. therefore, experiments were performed to
determine whether phenylpropanolamine activates vascular ␣2adrenoceptors. mouse tail and mesenteric small arteries and
human small dermal veins were isolated and analyzed in a
perfusion myograph. the selective ␣1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine caused constriction of tail and mesenteric arteries
and human veins. the selective ␣ 2 -adrenergic agonist
uk14,304 [5-bromo-n-(4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-6quinoxalinamine] caused constriction in tail arteries and in hu-

materials and methods
blood vessel chamber. male mice (c57bl6) were euthanized
by co2 asphyxiation. small arteries/arterioles were then rapidly and
carefully isolated from the mesenteric and tail circulations and
placed in cold krebs-ringer-bicarbonate solution: 118.3 mm nacl,
4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm kh2po4, 2.5 mm cacl2, 25.0
mm nahco3, and 11.1 mm glucose (control solution). skin biopsies
(6 mm, inner aspect of the upper arm) were obtained from human
volunteers, following irrigation of the site with local anesthetic
(chotani et al., 2004). small cutaneous dermal veins were then
carefully isolated from the biopsy and placed in control solution.
blood vessels were cannulated at both ends with glass micropipettes,
secured using 12-0 nylon monofilament suture, and placed in a
microvascular chamber (living systems, burlington, vt) (chotani et
al., 2000). blood vessels were studied in the absence of flow and
maintained at a constant transmural pressure (ptm) of 60 mm hg
(small arteries) or 7.5 mm hg (small veins). the chamber was placed
on the stage of an inverted microscope (nikon tms-f; nikon, tokyo,
japan) connected to a video camera and superfused with control
solution (maintained at 37°c, gassed with 16% o2, 5% co2, balance
n2; ph 7.4). the blood vessel image was projected onto a video
monitor and internal diameters continuously monitored by a video
dimension analyzer (living systems) and biopac data acquisition
system (santa barbara, ca). animal procedures were approved by
the ohio state university animal care and use committee. human
volunteers gave informed consent, and the biopsy procedure was
approved by the ohio state university human subjects irb committee.
experimental protocol. blood vessels were allowed to equilibrate for 30 to 40 min before commencing experiments. concentration-effect curves to the selective ␣1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, the selective ␣2-ar agonist uk14,304 [5-bromo-n-(4,5-dihydro1h-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine], or to phenylpropanolamine
were generated by increasing the concentration of the agonists in
half-log increments, once the constriction to the previous concentration had stabilized (flavahan et al., 1984; chotani et al., 2000).
following completion of the concentration-effect curve, the influence
of the agonists was terminated by repeatedly exchanging the buffer
solution and allowing the blood vessels to return to their stable
baseline levels. in some experiments, concentration-effect curves to
phenylpropanolamine were determined under control conditions and
then in the presence of the selective ␣2-adrenergic antagonist rauwolscine (10⫺7 m) and/or the selective ␣1-adrenergic antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m) (flavahan et al., 1984). when these inhibitors
were used, the blood vessels were incubated for 30 min with the

drugs prior to and during exposure of the arteries to the agonist.
experiments were also performed to confirm that repeated exposure
of blood vessels to phenylpropanolamine in the absence of antagonists evoked similar constrictor responses. in some experiments,
endothelial cells of mesenteric and tail arteries were removed by
gently placing a wire (70 ␮ in diameter) through the vessel lumen.
this procedure abolished endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (10⫺9 to 10⫺6 m), assessed during constriction to phenylephrine (by ⬃35% baseline diameter).
drugs. acetylcholine chloride, phenylephrine hydrochloride,
phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride,  xxxd3001xxx , rauwolscine hydrochloride, and uk14,304 were obtained from sigmaaldrich (st. louis, mo). stock solutions of drugs were prepared
freshly each day and stored at 4°c during the experiment. drugs
were dissolved in distilled water with the exception of uk14,304,
which was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (highest chamber concentration of 0.001%). drug concentrations are described as final molar
concentration (moles/liter) in the chamber superfusate.
data analysis. vasoconstriction and vasodilation were expressed
as a percentage of the internal diameter of the blood vessel prior to
administrating the agent. because of the phasic behavior of vasomotion in tail arteries, the signal was electronically averaged to obtain
diameter measurements (chotani et al., 2000). data are expressed as
means ⫾ s.e.m. for n number of experiments, where n equals the
number of animals or humans from which blood vessels were studied. because intense constriction of isolated blood vessels may result
in arterial injury, constrictor responses were restricted to ⬍50%
of baseline diameter. because of this restriction, we were unable
to determine the maximal responses to ␣1-adrenergic activation.
concentration-effect curves to constrictor agonists were analyzed by
determining the agonist concentration causing 15% constriction
(cc15) (chotani et al., 2000). statistical evaluation of the data was
performed by student’s t test for either paired or unpaired observations. when more than two means were compared, analysis of variance was used. if a significant f value was found, scheffe’s test for
multiple comparisons was employed to identify differences among
groups. values were considered to be statistically different when p
was ⬍0.05.

ptm of 60 mm hg, the internal diameters of tail and mesenteric arteries were similar: 124.9 ⫾ 10.0 ␮ (n ⫽ 16) and
136.3 ⫾ 6.5 ␮ (n ⫽ 10), respectively (p ⫽ ns). the selective
␣1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10⫺9 to 10⫺6 m) caused
concentration-dependent constriction of both types of artery,
with a 2.7-fold higher potency in tail compared with mesenteric arteries (log cc15 values of ⫺6.84 ⫾ 0.08 and ⫺6.41 ⫾
0.17, respectively; n ⫽ 10, p ⬍ 0.05) (fig. 1a). the selective

constriction of tail arteries (log cc15 of ⫺8.72 ⫾ 0.08, n ⫽ 9)
but not mesenteric arteries (n ⫽ 10) (fig. 1b).
in addition to vascular smooth muscle ␣2-adrenoceptors,
which initiate constriction, endothelial cells express ␣2-adrenoceptors that can mediate dilation (flavahan et al., 1989).
the inability of ␣2-adrenoceptor stimulation to initiate constriction could therefore reflect increased activity of endothelial ␣2-adrenoceptors in mesenteric compared with tail arteries. in mesenteric arteries constricted by ⬃ 35% of baseline
diameter with phenylephrine, uk14,304 (10⫺9 to 10⫺7 m)
caused relaxation (maximal observed effect equal to 10.9 ⫾
2.5% of baseline diameter, n ⫽ 4, p ⬍ 0.05), which was
abolished by endothelial denudation (fig. 2a). during a similar degree of constriction with phenylephrine, acetylcholine

by most blood vessels, functional constrictor ␣2-adrenoceptors have a unique distribution in the human vasculature
(e.g., guimaraes and moura, 2001). because of their role in
vascular thermoregulation, ␣2-adrenoceptors are more active
in cutaneous compared with deep blood vessels (chotani et
al., 2000, 2004). they also have considerable activity in blood
vessels of the nasal mucosa, where their activity can predominate over ␣1-adrenoceptors (andersson and bende, 1984;
lacroix and lundberg, 1989; wang and lung, 2003). indeed,
activation of ␣2-adrenoceptors may be the preferred choice
for causing nasal vasoconstriction and nasal decongestion
(mcleod et al., 2001). the present experiments were therefore performed to evaluate the activity of phenylpropanolamine at vascular ␣1- and ␣2-adrenoceptors. blood vessels
were selected that should contain functional ␣1- and ␣2adrenoceptors (mouse tail artery and human dermal veins) or
contain only ␣1-adrenoceptors (mouse mesenteric artery)
(e.g., flavahan et al., 1984; nase and boegehold, 1998;
chotani et al., 2000).

although ␣1-adrenoceptors mediate constriction of most
blood vessels, ␣2-adrenoceptors have a more restricted distribution in the vasculature. within the arterial system, smooth
muscle ␣2-adrenoceptors are generally not functional in large

arteries, with their activity increasing in distal vessels (flavahan et al., 1987; nielsen et al., 1990; chotani et al., 2000).

1998), whereas in certain systems, notably the cutaneous
circulation, ␣2-adrenergic constrictor activity is greatly increased (flavahan et al., 1987). indeed, in the present study,

transmission and the release of norepinephrine (davies et
al., 1993; buckner et al., 2002), consistent with activation of
prejunctional ␣2-adrenoceptors. the results of the present
study demonstrate that phenylpropanolamine functions as a
preferential ␣2-adrenergic agonist in the vasculature. in the
tail artery, which unlike the mesenteric artery expresses
functional ␣2a-adrenoceptors (chotani et al., 2000), phenylpropanolamine caused constriction at 62-fold lower concentrations than those needed to activate ␣1-adrenoceptors in
mesenteric arteries. indeed, constriction to phenylpropanolamine in the tail artery was not affected by the ␣1-adrenergic
antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m) but was profoundly inhibited by the ␣2-adrenergic antagonist, rauwolscine. rauwolscine caused a 56-fold shift in the concentration-effect curve,
consistent with a kb of 2 ⫻ 10⫺9 m and ␣2-adrenoceptor
antagonism (flavahan et al., 1984; guimaraes and moura,
2001). indeed, after rauwolscine, phenylpropanolamine had
similar sensitivity in tail and mesenteric arteries. however,
after ␣2-adrenergic blockade in tail arteries, the residual
response to phenylpropanolamine was still resistant to inhibition by  xxxd3000xxx , suggesting that phenylpropanolamine
had still not reached threshold for activating ␣1-adrenoceptors. based on sensitivity to agonists and antagonists, the
␣1-adrenoceptors mediating constriction of these blood vessels are similar (daly et al., 2002). therefore, these results
are consistent with the radioligand binding studies (minneman et al., 1983; buckner et al., 2002) and demonstrate that
phenylpropanolamine is a preferential ␣2-adrenergic agonist,
activating ␣2-adrenoceptors at lower concentrations (⬎60fold) than those required to stimulate ␣1-adrenoceptors. the
increased functional selectivity of phenylpropanolamine, relative to its binding activity at these receptors, may reflect a
lower efficacy at ␣1- compared with ␣2-adrenoceptors (e.g.,
buckner et al., 2002). the radioligand binding analysis was
performed using human ␣2a-adrenoceptors (buckner et al.,
2002), whereas constriction of tail arteries is dependent on
the rodent homolog of this receptor (␣2a/d-adrenoceptor)
(chotani et al., 2000). therefore, the results suggest that
phenylpropanolamine does not discriminate between these
receptors.
activation of vascular ␣2-adrenoceptors generally produces
a lower maximal response compared with ␣1-adrenoceptors
(flavahan and mcgrath, 1984; flavahan et al., 1984). in tail
arteries, ␣2-adrenergic stimulation generates a maximum of
approximately 30% constriction, whereas ␣1-adrenergic constriction is capable of almost complete closure of tail and
mesenteric arteries. from fig. 3, the selectivity ratio of phenylpropanolamine between tail and mesenteric arteries (or
between ␣2- and ␣1-adrenoceptors) is greatest at a low level of
response and decreases at higher levels of constriction. this
reflects the distinct profile of ␣1- and ␣2-adrenergic vascular
responses and the low maximal effect of ␣2-adrenoceptors.
indeed, the increased potency of uk14,304 compared with
phenylephrine (fig. 1) also decreases at higher levels of constriction. in the most extreme case, when responses exceed
the maximum response attainable by ␣2-adrenoceptors, then
only ␣1-adrenoceptor activity is observed (flavahan et al.,
1984). concentration-effect curves were assessed at agonist
concentrations causing 15% constriction of baseline diameter. although this may be a relatively low level of constriction
for ␣1-adrenoceptors, it represents ⬃50% of the ␣2-adrenergic
maximum and is the most appropriate level for comparing

activation with uk14,304 constricted only the tail arteries.
this latter effect is mediated by ␣2a-adrenoceptors (chotani
et al., 2000). the failure of ␣2-adrenoceptors to mediate constriction of mesenteric arteries did not reflect activity of
endothelial ␣2-adrenoceptors. although uk14,304 caused a
small endothelium-dependent relaxation in mesenteric arteries, endothelium denudation did not uncover constriction to
the ␣2-adrenergic agonist.
phenylpropanolamine is a low-efficacy agonist at ␣1-adrenoceptors, interacting with similar low affinity at ␣1a-, ␣1b-,
and ␣1d-adrenoceptors (ki values of ⬃9 ⫻ 10⫺6 m) (minneman et al., 1983; buckner et al., 2002). in smooth muscle
preparations replete with ␣1a (human, pig, and rabbit urethra; rat vas deferens) or ␣1b-adrenoceptors (rat spleen; rabbit aorta), phenylpropanolamine caused contraction with
maximums of 13 to 60% (compared with high-efficacy ␣adrenergic agonists) and with ed50 values exceeding
⬃10⫺4 m (minneman et al., 1983; fox et al., 1985; alberts et
al., 1999; nishimatsu et al., 1999; buckner et al., 2002; dillon
et al., 2004). in rat aorta, which is replete with ␣1d-adrenoceptors, phenylpropanolamine was slightly more effective
(maximum, 87%; ed50 value, 6 ⫻ 10⫺5 m) (buckner et al.,
2002). other ␣-adrenergic agonists also had increased activity in rat aorta (buckner et al., 2002), likely reflecting the
large receptor reserve (bognar and enero, 1988), rather than
preferential activity of phenylpropanolamine for ␣1d-adrenoceptors. in the present study, phenylpropanolamine caused
constriction of mesenteric arteries, which was abolished by
the ␣1-adrenergic antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  but not affected by the
␣2-adrenergic antagonist rauwolscine. this ␣1-adrenergic response to phenylpropanolamine occurred at concentrations
similar to those reported previously. all three subtypes of
␣1-adrenoceptors may contribute to constriction of mouse
mesenteric arteries (yamamoto and koike, 2001; daly et al.,
2002).
phenylpropanolamine is often described as a selective ␣1adrenergic agonist. however, previous analyses of smooth
muscle contraction were generally restricted to preparations
that lacked functional ␣2-adrenoceptors (human, pig, or rabbit urethra; rat vas deferens; rat spleen; rat or rabbit aorta;
minneman et al., 1983; fox et al., 1985; alberts et al., 1999;
nishimatsu et al., 1999; buckner et al., 2002; dillon et al.,
2004). furthermore, when phenylpropanolamine was analyzed in systems expressing ␣1 and ␣2-adrenoceptors, the
selected responses were restricted to ␣1-adrenoceptors (minneman and johnson, 1984; fox et al., 1985) dominated by
␣1-adrenoceptors (wellman and davies, 1991; wellman and
davies, 1992) or not characterized with regard to ␣-adrenergic subtypes (stevens and moulds, 1981). in the pithed rat,
phenylpropanolamine evoked pressor responses that were
more sensitive to  xxxd3000xxx  compared with rauwolscine, suggesting that phenylpropanolamine preferentially activated
␣1-adrenoceptors (moya-huff and maher, 1987). however,
the animals had been treated with the long-acting anesthetic
urethane (moya-huff and maher, 1987), which is an ␣2adrenergic antagonist (armstrong et al., 1982) and could
have reduced any ␣2-adrenergic component.
phenylpropanolamine binds directly to human ␣2a-adrenoceptors with a ki of 3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m, demonstrating an approximate 35-fold higher affinity for these receptors compared
with ␣1-ars (minneman et al., 1983; buckner et al., 2002).
indeed, phenylpropanolamine inhibits sympathetic neuro-

responses (flavahan et al., 1984; chotani et al., 2000). furthermore, because vascular resistance is inversely related to
the 4th power of the vessel radius, a 15% decrease in diameter generates a stimulus to decrease blood flow by ⬃50%.
this level of response is therefore of pharmacological and
physiological relevance.
in contrast to their selective distribution in the arterial
circulation, ␣2-adrenoceptors are widely expressed and
functional within the venous system (flavahan et al.,
1984; steen et al., 1984a,b; tornebrandt et al., 1985;
sjoberg et al., 1987). in the present study, human small
dermal veins responded with constriction to phenylephrine
or uk14,304 consistent with the presence of ␣1 and ␣2adrenoceptors. the identity of the ␣1- and ␣2-adrenoceptor
subtypes was not further characterized. as with mouse
arteries, constriction of human veins by phenylpropanolamine was not affected by  xxxd3000xxx  but was markedly
inhibited by rauwolscine. rauwolscine caused a 29-fold
shift in the concentration-effect curve, consistent with a
kb of 3.6 ⫻ 10⫺9 m and with its activity in the tail artery.
therefore, in mouse and human blood vessels, phenylpropanolamine acts as a preferential ␣2-adrenergic agonist,
demonstrating considerable selectivity for this receptor
subtype. the potency of phenylpropanolamine was slightly
reduced in human veins compared with tail arteries. this
was paralleled by a similar decrease in sensitivity to
uk14,304, suggesting reduced activity of ␣2-adrenoceptors
rather than any difference in activity of phenylpropanolamine at human and mice receptors. indeed, ␣2-adrenergic
activity is reduced in small compared with large cutaneous
veins (guimaraes and moura, 2001).
regulation of nasal venous systems plays a prominent role
in controlling mucosal congestion and patency of the nasal
cavity (wang and lung, 2003). sympathetic nasal decongestants act by constricting the vasculature of the nasal mucosa,
mediated by activation of ␣1- and/or ␣2-adrenoceptors. interestingly, ␣2-adrenoceptors predominate over ␣1-adrenoceptors in regulating blood flow and constriction of the collecting
veins of the nasal mucosa (andersson and bende, 1984; lacroix and lundberg, 1989; wang and lung, 2003). indeed,
␣2-adrenergic activation has been proposed as a preferred
mechanism for nasal decongestion (mcleod et al., 2001).
when used as a  xxxd2565xxx , therapeutic administration of phenylpropanolamine (25 mg immediate release) generated peak circulating levels of approximately 90 ng/ml (6 ⫻
10⫺7 m) (saltzman et al., 1983), with the free concentration
reduced by plasma protein binding (stockley et al., 1994). at
this concentration, phenylpropanolamine can constrict blood
vessels by activating smooth muscle ␣2-adrenoceptors, but it
is far below the threshold for activating ␣1-adrenoceptors.
therefore, ␣2-adrenoceptor activation by phenylpropanolamine likely contributed to its therapeutic effect, namely
constriction of the nasal vasculature.
