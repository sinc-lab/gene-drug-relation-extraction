summary – atypical neuroleptics that block serotonin 2a (5-ht 2a) and dopamine 2 (d2) receptors have been shown
to possess efficacious antipsychotic activity. we assessed the efficacy of the addition of the 5-ht 2a/2c and  xxxg831xxx 
antagonist  xxxd2637xxx  to ongoing haloperidol treatment in chronically hospitalized (> 10 years) drug-resistant schizophrenic patients (n = 12). the patients were assessed at baseline and every three months for one year with the brief
psychiatric rating scale and the clinical global impression. results showed a significant (but < 10%) improvement in
the core symptoms of schizophrenia; however, only the reduction (by 43%) in anxiety was clinically relevant
(p < 0.0001). the beneficial effect of  xxxd2637xxx  may be related to the combined blockade of 5-ht 2a and histamine
(h1) receptors. © 2000 éditions scientifiques et médicales elsevier sas

introduction
agents that block serotonin 2a (5-ht 2a) and dopamine 2 (d2) receptors, such as the atypical neuroleptics
risperidone,  xxxd3195xxx , clozapine and olanzapine [2,
11], have been reported to possess efficacious antipsychotic activity. apparently the serotonin-dopamine
interaction plays a regulatory role in dopamine neurotransmission in the limbic and nigrostriatal pathways, and the 5-ht2 antagonistic property of the
atypical neuroleptics alleviates the extrapyramidal symptoms resulting from d2 blockade [9].
ritanserin is a selective 5-ht 2a receptor antagonist
that has no effect on dopamine receptors. it has been

shown to alleviate psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic
patients, with a possible preference for negative symptoms [2, 4, 5]. reyntjens et al. [16] and mizuki et al.
[12, 13] reported that the addition of ritanserin or
 xxxd2637xxx  to ongoing neuroleptic treatment increased
the therapeutic effect, at least in terms of negative
symptoms; however, these findings were not confirmed
in another study [10].
the aim of the present work was to assess the efficacy
of the addition of the 5-ht 2a/2c and  xxxg831xxx  antagonist
 xxxd2637xxx  [15] to ongoing haloperidol treatment in
drug-resistant chronically hospitalized (> 10 years)
schizophrenic patients.

 xxxd2637xxx  addition schizophrenia

subjects and methods

sion (cgi) [6] were used to evaluate the severity of the
psychotic symptoms.

subjects
statistical analysis
twelve schizophrenic inpatients (five women, seven
men) aged 39–67 years (mean ± sd 52.8 ± 6.9 years)
were included in the study. the diagnosis of chronic
schizophrenia was established according to the dsm-iv
criteria. the duration of the disease ranged from 20 to
43 years (33.1 ± 6.6 years). all the patients had been
hospitalized in closed departments for the last 3 to 26
years (14.9 ± 5.6 years) without remission.
the patients had all been treated with adequate doses
of various neuroleptic agents, including phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes, and the atypical
neuroleptic sulpiride, for at least four months, and
maintained
on
haloperidol
10–30 mg/d
(14.1 ± 2.7 mg/d) for at least one year. none had
responded to the conventional antipsychotic drugs, and
treatment with the atypical neuroleptic clozapine was
being considered. however, because clozapine is associated with a risk of agranulocytosis and significant side
effects, we decided to first attempt the addition of the
5-ht 2a/2c antagonist  xxxd2637xxx  to the ongoing treatment with the typical d2 antagonist haloperidol.
 xxxd2637xxx , 30 mg/d, was administered at bedtime.
only in one patient was the dosage increased to 60 mg/d
after three months of non-response.
the patients were assessed at baseline (three days
before  xxxd2637xxx  addition) and every three months, for
a total follow-up of 12 months. the brief psychiatric
rating scale (bprs) [14] and clinical global impres-

one-way analysis of variance (anova) with repeated
measures was used to assess the alterations in clinical
status. all results are expressed as mean ± sd.
results
the impact of  xxxd2637xxx  addition to ongoing haloperidol treatment on the scores for the total bprs, individual bprs clusters (subscales), and cgi is
summarized in table i. a significant reduction was
achieved in the anxiety subscale of the bprs (–43%;
p < 0.0001) in week 12. there were also statistically
significant reductions in mean cgi score, total bprs
score, and thought withdrawal, but they did not reach
clinical significance (< 10%). the hostility subscale
score did not change significantly following  xxxd2637xxx 
addition. three patients improved enough to be discharged the following year.  xxxd2637xxx  addition was
well tolerated; however, four patients complained of
sedation during the first month of the treatment. in
these four patients, the reduction in anxiety (table i)
was not associated with the decrease in vigilance level.
discussion
the major finding of this study is that the addition of
the 5-ht 2a/2c and  xxxg831xxx  antagonist  xxxd2637xxx  to ongo-

ing haloperidol treatment in drug-resistant, chronically
hospitalized schizophrenic patients significantly
improves the core symptoms of schizophrenia, as
reflected by the cgi and total bprs scores (including
three of the four bprs subscales) (table i).
these results are consistent with a recent study demonstrating the beneficial effect of high-dose  xxxd2637xxx 
(60–90 mg/d) given for ten months as adjuvant therapy
to standard long-acting antipsychotic agents [3], as well
as with a study demonstrating the efficacy of  xxxd2637xxx 
for psychosis induced by antiparkinsonian drugs [8].
however, from a clinical point of view, only the reduction in the anxiety subscale of the bprs was clinically
relevant (> 40%), while the changes in all the other
parameters were less than 10% (table i). it has been
hypothesized that it is the combined antagonistic activity at the 5-ht2 and d2 receptors that is important in
the mechanism of action of atypical neuroleptics, as
reflected by the beneficial effect of the 5-ht2/d2
antagonists risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine in
schizophrenia [2, 9, 11]. in view of our findings, we
suggest that in drug-resistant chronic schizophrenia,
the antagonistic activity of several neuroreceptors may
be required to achieve clozapine-like antipsychotic activity; as demonstrated recently [3], longer treatment (> 12
months) with this combination or a higher dose of
 xxxd2637xxx  (up to 90 mg/d) is needed to achieve sufficient 5-ht blockade for a clinically significant effect.
it is likely that it was  xxxd2637xxx ’s combined 5-ht 2a
and histamine (h1) antagonism that was responsible
for its anxiolytic effect in our chronic schizphrenic
patients, and not its antagonistic action at the  xxxg831xxx 
noradrenergic autoreceptor, since selective  xxxg831xxx  antagonists such as yohimbine usually provoke anxiety rather
than reduce it [1, 7].
we conclude that  xxxd2637xxx  addition is clearly associated with a prominent reduction in anxiety level in a
subset of drug-resistant long-term (20–43 years) hospitalized schizophrenic patients. this reduction may be
related to the additional blockade of 5-ht 2a/2c and
h1 receptors. future large-scale, long-term, doubleblind placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm
the efficacy of the addition of 5-ht 2a antagonists to
typical neuroleptics in drug-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients.
