a series of phenoxyalkyl and phenylthioalkyl amides were prepared as melatoninergic ligands. modulation of afﬁnity of the newly synthesized compound by applying sars around the terminal amide moiety,
the alkyl chain, and the methoxy group on the aromatic ring provides compounds with nanomolar afﬁnity for both melatonin receptor subtypes. afﬁnity towards mt1 and mt2 receptors were modulated also
exploiting chirality. the investigation of intrinsic activity revealed that all the tested compounds behave
as full or partial agonists.

1. introduction
melatonin ( xxxd2559xxx , mlt, fig. 1) is a
neurohormone secreted primarily by the pineal gland, the highest
levels occurring during the period of darkness.1 it plays a major
role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and the control of seasonal cycles.2 extensive studies have demonstrated that administration of mlt alleviates jet-lag and regulates delayed sleep
phase syndrome.3 furthermore, exogenous mlt acts as sleep promoter, chronohypnotic and/or chronobiotic.4,5 neuroprotective,6
free radical scavenging, antioxidant,7–9 and immunomodulatory10
properties of mlt have also been reported. recently, mlt has been
investigated for its potential use as anticancer,11–13 antinﬂammatory,14 antihypertensive,15 radioprotector in radiotherapy,16 and
it has been even postulated the existence of a possible link
between it and type 2 diabetes.17 the obvious impact of mlt is actually underlined by more than 14,000 articles. many of its physiological actions are mediated through g-protein coupled
receptors18 expressed in a wide variety of tissues. cloning studies
have revealed at least three mlt receptor subtypes, two of which
have been found in mammals, mt1 (mel1a) and mt2 (mel1b),19
localized in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues.20,21 recently, another mlt binding site (mt3) has been

described in hamster as homologue of the cytoplasmic quinone
reductase 2.22 the way in which mlt binds at these receptors
and the possible therapeutic potential of mlt in a wide variety of
clinical conditions has led to a rising interest in the development
of compounds capable of mimicking the effects of mlt, also considering that the use of mlt as a drug is limited by its short biological half-life, poor oral bioavailability, and ubiquitous action.23
thus, during the past decade, a great number of structurally different mlt receptor ligands, which range from simple indole derivatives and their bioisosteres to phenylalkyl amides and constrained
melatoninergic agents, have been reported in the literature.24 it is
noteworthy that nearly all these compounds present an amido
group and an alkoxyaryl moiety that seem to be critical in determining the binding afﬁnity and biological activity of these melatoninergic ligands.25 some mt1/mt2 agonists are currently under
clinical evaluation or have been approved for their hypnotic
properties;  xxxd3078xxx  (fig. 1) is at the present the only non selective mlt receptors agonist marketed in the us for the treatment

a. carocci et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 18 (2010) 6496–6511

of insomnia.26,27 other mt1/mt2 agonists, such as ly-15673528 or
 xxxd3294xxx  ( xxxd3294xxx ),29 are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of sleep disorders.  xxxd95xxx , an mt1/mt2 agonist and 5ht2c antagonist, is under evaluation for the treatment of unipolar
depression.30
several years ago, basing on results obtained on a series of
phenylalkyl amides by garratt et al.31 we examined several substituted phenoxyalkyl amides by exploiting the well known isosteric
relationship between the methylene group and the oxygen atom.32
from structure–activity relationships (sars) on these compounds,
it appeared that the phenoxy moiety is a sufﬁcient core to provide
compounds with signiﬁcant potency as mlt agonists. in this paper,
we report the synthesis, the binding data, and activity results for
human mt1 and mt2 receptors of n-(phenoxyalkyl)amides and
their thioisologues, novel non-indolic mlt-like compounds, that
could be considered simpliﬁed models of mlt (fig. 2). starting
from n-(2-phenoxyethyl) xxxd63xxx  as a scaffold we investigated
in detail: (i) the role and the optimal position of the methoxy group
on the aromatic moiety in structures that do not show the indole
nucleus; (ii) the effect of isosteric substitution of the side chain;
(iii) the effect of formal introduction of a methyl group on the alkyl
chain; and (iv) the effect of a slight modulation of the acyl group.
starting from the observation that both indole33,34 and non-indole35,36 chiral mt1 and mt2 ligands can show stereoselectivity
in terms of afﬁnity and efﬁcacy, we speculated that afﬁnity towards mlt receptors might be modulated exploiting chirality;
thus, we decided to synthesize and test our chiral compounds in
their optically active form.
2. results and discussion
2.1. chemistry
compound 2037 in its racemic and enantiomeric forms and (r)and (s)-23c38 were prepared as previously described.37,38 racemic
propylacetamides 7a,b were prepared via the synthetic route
shown in scheme 1. alkylation of the suitable phenol (1a,b) with
racemic ethyl 2-bromopropanoate 2 gave 3a,b which were hydrolyzed and then converted into the corresponding amides (5a,b).
reduction of the amides and successive n-acetylation with acetic
anhydride afforded the target compounds.
ethylacetamides (12a–h) were prepared either by condensation
of the phthalimido alcohol 8 with the appropriate phenol (1a–d)
under mitsunobu conditions39 or by a williamson reaction of n(2-bromoethyl)phthalimide (9) with the suitable thiophenol (1e–
h), followed by hydrazinolysis40 of the corresponding phthalimido
derivatives (10a–h) and n-acylation of amines 11a–h with acetic
anhydride (scheme 2).
racemic propyl n-alkanamides (7c–e, 15d–e, and 16d–e) were
prepared according to scheme 3. alkylation of the suitable phenol
or thiophenol (1c–e) with racemic 2 gave the esters (3c–e) which
were submitted to reduction. the alcohols obtained (13c–e) were
condensed with phthalimide following a typical mitsunobu procedure. hydrazinolysis run on the resulting phthalimido derivatives
(14c–e) gave the corresponding amines 6c–e. n-acylation of the
crude amines with acetic or n-butyric anhydride or with cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride provides the desired mlt ligands.

optically active propyl n-alkanamides (7d,e, 15d,e, and 16d,e)
were prepared according to the same route followed for the synthesis of racemic propyl n-alkanamides except for the ﬁrst step
where the alcohols 13d,e were obtained by condensation of the
appropriate phenol or thiophenol (1d,e) with enantiomerically
pure methyl 2-hydroxypropanoates [(r)- and (s)-17] under mitsunobu conditions (scheme 4).
1-methylethylacetamides (23c,d) in their racemic and optically
active forms were prepared according to the synthetic route reported in scheme 5, which involved the mitsunobu reaction of
2-aminopropanols (19), efﬁciently protected with phthalic anhydride, with the appropriate phenol (1c,d). hydrazinolysis of the
resultant phthalimido derivatives (21c,d) and n-acylation of the
obtained amines (22c,d) with acetic anhydride gave the desired
acetamides.
phenylthio methylethylacetamides (23e,f), in their racemic and
optically active forms, were prepared as reported in scheme 6, by
modifying a one-pot literature procedure,41 which involved the
reaction of the appropriate thiol (1e,f) with 2-aminopropanol and
acetic acid.
enantiomeric excess (ee) values for all the homochiral compounds were determined either by chiral hplc or gc analyses.
2.2. structure–afﬁnity and structure–intrinsic activity
relationships
the binding afﬁnities of n-(phenoxyalkyl)amides and n-(phenylthioalkyl)amides for human mt1 and mt2 receptors measured by
competition binding analysis using the radioligand 2-[125i]- xxxd2377xxx  are shown in table 1.
comparison of phenoxyethyl acetamides 12a–d reveals clearly
that the isomer with the methoxy group in the meta-position of
the aromatic moiety (12d) has the highest binding afﬁnity; these
results agree with the data obtained by garratt et al.31 in the corresponding series of phenylpropyl acetamides, which demonstrated the superiority of compounds with methoxy groups in
the meta-position over their isomers. it is noteworthy that the
unsubstituted phenoxy derivative 12c shows a slightly higher
afﬁnity than the corresponding ortho- and para-methoxy derivatives 12a,b. furthermore, 12d behaves as full agonist, whereas
compounds 12a–c are partial agonists.
results for compounds 7a–d, in which a methyl group has been
formally introduced into the position adjacent to the oxygen atom
of the alkyl chain, reveal an interesting increase of binding afﬁnity
at both receptor subtypes for all derivatives of this series when
compared to the related compounds 12a–d. also in this case, the
highest binding afﬁnity occurs for the meta-methoxy derivative
7d, followed by the unsubstituted derivative 7c.
on the other hand, the formal introduction of a methyl group
into the position adjacent to the nitrogen atom, as in 23c,d, leads
to a decrease in mt1 and mt2 binding afﬁnity (23d vs 12d) or
has no effect (23c vs 12c). in order to optimize the biological proﬁle
of the highest-afﬁnity ligand 7d, we modulated the acyl chain by
replacing the methyl group with substituents that are often present in other mlt ligands, such as cyclopropyl or n-propyl, obtaining 15d and 16d, respectively. the replacement of the methyl
group in 7d with a cyclopropyl gave the most interesting compound of the series, 15d, which showed an excellent binding afﬁnity for mt1 receptors (pki = 9.03) close to that of mlt (pki = 9.48)
with a mt2/mt1 selectivity ratio of 13. on the other hand, mt1
and mt2 binding afﬁnities were substantially unaffected by substitution of the methyl group with a n-propyl as in 16d. the most potent compounds (7d, 15d, and 16d) act as full agonists.
in order to probe the lipophilic and electronic requirements of
the receptors binding pocket accommodating the aromatic moiety,
we replaced the oxygen atom of the alkyl chain by a sulphur.

despite a slight increase or no signiﬁcant difference in afﬁnity
showed by phenylthioethyl acetamides 12e–h with respect to
the corresponding phenoxyethyl acetamides 12a–d, the same
modiﬁcations to the alkyl chain as were carried out for the phenoxyethyl derivatives generally reduces the afﬁnity for both mt1
and mt2 receptors (see 7e, 15e, 16e, and 23e vs 7d, 15d, 16d,
and 23d, respectively). functional analysis on mt1 and mt2 receptors of the most potent sulphurated isologues (12e and 16e)

showed them to be full agonists except for compound 15e which
behaves as partial agonist.
furthermore, in order to investigate the stereochemical requirements for the binding site, the enantiomers of the chiral compounds were prepared in their highly optically enriched
enantiomeric forms and examined for their binding afﬁnity. as
expected, a signiﬁcant difference between the enantiomers was
observed; in particular, among the most potent compounds, the

s-enantiomers behave as eutomers. the highest stereoselectivity was
observed for the thioderivative 7e, being ki distomer/ki eutomer
ratio of 460 and 94 for mt1 and mt2 receptors, respectively. it is
noteworthy that the most potent compound of the series (s)-15d
shows a certain degree of selectivity in favour of mt1 with a
mt2/mt1 selectivity ratio of 6. as regards the intrinsic activity, all
the most potent homochiral compounds behave as agonists, with

the exception of compounds 15e and 16e for which the eutomers
(s-enantiomers) are full agonists, whereas the distomers are partial
agonists.
in summary, a novel series of n-(phenoxyalkyl)amides and their
thioisologues were prepared in order to investigate structure–
afﬁnity and structure–intrinsic activity relationships for mt1
and mt2 receptors. within this series, the effect of bioisosteric

substitution of the indole nucleus, the role of the methoxy group
and changes in the n-acyl side chain were considered. furthermore,
in order to gain more insight into the receptor stereochemistry,
we have examined the afﬁnities of the single enantiomers of the
chiral compounds. our experience establishes the substituted
phenoxy and phenylthio moieties as novel bioisosteres for the indole nucleus of the endogenous ligand and its close analogues.
the data highlight that derivatives with a methoxy group (12d vs
12a–c, 12e vs 12f–h, and 7d vs 7a–c) placed in a position that
can be easily superposed to position 5 of the indole ring of mlt
usually have the highest binding afﬁnity, a behaviour consistent
with what was observed for other series of mlt receptor ligands.31,42 shift of the methoxy group from the meta- to the paraor ortho-positions, in fact, greatly reduces binding afﬁnity and
intrinsic activity at both receptor subtypes; the pki values obtained
for these compounds are even lower than those of the unsubstituted analogues. these data are in agreement with the results obtained on mlt derivatives in which the shift of the methoxy
group from position 5 to position 6 led to a drastic reduction in
binding afﬁnity and to partial agonist behaviour.43 reduction of
binding afﬁnity and intrinsic activity because of the shifting of
the methoxy group has also been observed in other series of mlt
receptor ligands.44 the effect of acyl chain modulation has been
evaluated on the basis of compounds 15d,e and 16d,e. the n-propyl
substituent is tolerated at both receptor subtypes. interestingly,
pursuing a similar substitution pattern with the cyclopropyl
derivatives 15d resulted in the achievement of subnanomolar
mt1 afﬁnity. the positive effect of cyclopropyl group had already
been observed for other mlt ligands.45 our experience evidenced
a stereoselective behaviour of the most potent compounds both
in phenoxyalkyl and phenylthioalkyl series; in all cases the s-enantiomers were found to be more potent agonists than the r-ones.

in general, replacement of the ether function with a thioether
one slightly inﬂuences receptor binding afﬁnity, but provides compound 7e which shows the highest stereodifferentiation especially
for mt1 subtype. a reasonable interpretation of this result could be
related to the different lipophilic and electronic properties of
oxygen and sulphur atoms.
3. conclusions
sars have been deﬁned around the terminal amide moiety, the
alkyl chain, and the methoxy group on the aromatic ring of a new
series of phenoxyalkyl and phenylthioalkyl amides as novel melatoninergic ligands. a methoxy group in the meta-position is crucial for receptor binding afﬁnity. intrinsic activity and afﬁnity
towards mt1 and mt2 receptors can be modulated by replacing
the methyl group of the acyl function with a propyl one. on the
other hand, receptor binding afﬁnity strongly depends on the presence and the location of a methyl group on the alkyl chain. afﬁnity
towards mt1 and mt2 receptors can be modulated also exploiting
chirality. these chemical modiﬁcations have afforded potent nanomolar compounds for both receptor subtypes. the highest level of
stereoselectivity was found in the series of the thioisologues for
compound 7e (ki distomer/ki eutomer ratio: 457 for mt1 subtype).
of particular interest, compound (s)-15d shows a binding afﬁnity
for the mt1 receptors (pki = 9.14) close to that of mlt
(pki = 9.48). these ﬁndings establish the meta-methoxyphenoxy
or meta-methoxyphenylthio ring as a novel bioisostere for the alkoxyaryl moiety of the endogenous ligand. the synthetic procedures
used are facile and versatile and allow insertion on the alkyl chain
of groups of different size and shape and, in general, modiﬁcation
of the scaffold according to classical medicinal chemistry procedures, thus envisaging further development of the present study.

4.11. general procedure for the preparation of cyclopropanecarboxamides (15d,e)
the method adopted for the synthesis of n-[2-(3-methoxyphenoxy)propyl]cyclopropane carboxamide (15d) is described. to a stirring solution of 6d (0.50 g, 2.76 mmol) and et3n (0.11 ml,
0.83 mmol) in dry toluene (5 ml) under n2 atmosphere, a solution
of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride (0.29 g, 2.76 mmol) was added
dropwise. the reaction mixture was reﬂuxed for 3 h, then the residue was taken up with etoac and washed twice with 2 n naoh,
twice with 2 n hcl and twice with a saturated aqueous nacl solution. the combined organic layers were dried (na2so4) and concentrated to give a yellow oil (78%) which was puriﬁed by

4.12. mlt receptor binding assay
binding afﬁnities of compounds were determined using 2[125i] xxxd2377xxx  as the labelled ligand in competition experiments on cloned human mt1 and mt2 receptors expressed in
nih3t3 rat ﬁbroblast cells. the characterization of nih3t3-mt1
and -mt2 cells was already described in detail.53,54 membranes
were incubated for 90 min at 37 °c in binding buffer (tris/hcl
50 mm, ph 7.4). the ﬁnal membrane concentration was 5–10 lg

of protein per tube. the membrane protein level was determined
in accordance with a previously reported method.55 2-[125i] xxxd2377xxx  (100 pm) and different concentrations of mlt and/or the
new compounds were incubated with the receptor preparation
for 90 min at 37 °c. ic50 values were determined by nonlinear ﬁtting strategies with the program prism (graphpad software inc.,
san diego, ca). the pki values were calculated from the ic50 values
in accordance with the cheng–prusoff equation.56 the pki values
are the mean of at least three independent determinations performed in duplicate. to deﬁne the functional activity of the new
compounds at mt1 and  xxxg1477xxx  subtypes, [35s]gtpcs binding
assays in nih3t3 cells expressing human-cloned mt1 or mt2
receptors were performed. the amount of bound [35s]gtpcs is proportional to the level of the analogue-induced g-protein activation
and is related to the intrinsic activity of the compound under
study. the detailed description and validation of this method were
reported elsewhere,53,57 membranes (15–25 lg of protein, ﬁnal
incubation volume 100 ll) were incubated at 30 °c for 30 min in
the presence and in the absence of mlt analogues in an assay buffer consisting of [35s]gtpcs (0.3–0.5 nm), gdp (50 lm), nacl
(100 mm), and mgcl2 (3 mm). nonspeciﬁc binding was deﬁned
using [35s]gtpcs (10 lm). in cell lines expressing human mt1 or
mt2 receptors, mlt produced a concentration-dependent stimulation of basal [35s]gtpcs binding with a maximal stimulation,
above basal levels, of 370% and 250% in mt1 and mt2 receptors,
respectively. basal stimulation is the amount of [35s]gtpcs specifically bound in the absence of compounds, and it was taken as
100%. the maximal g-protein activation was measured in each
experiment by using mlt (100 nm). compounds were added at
three different concentrations (one concentration was equivalent
to 100 nm mlt, a second one was 10 times smaller, and a third
one was 10 times larger), and the percent stimulation above basal
was determined. the equivalent concentration was estimated on
the basis of the ratio of the afﬁnity of the test compound over that
of mlt. it was assumed that at the equivalent concentration the
test compound occupies the same number of receptors as
100 nm mlt. all of the measurements were performed in triplicate. the relative intrinsic activity (iar) values were obtained by
dividing the maximum ligand-induced stimulation of [35s]gtpcs
binding by that of mlt, as measured in the same experiment. by
convention, the natural ligand mlt has an efﬁcacy (emax) of
100%. full agonists stimulate [35s]gtpcs binding with a maximum
efﬁcacy close to that of mlt itself. if emax is between 30% and 70%
that of mlt (0.3 < iar < 0.7), the compound is considered a partial
agonist, whereas if emax is lower than 30% (iar <0.3), the compound
is considered an antagonist.58
