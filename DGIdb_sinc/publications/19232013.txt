abstract
the aim of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of the intraocular-pressure (iop)-lowering
response in monkeys to the nonselective prostaglandin (pg)f2a-isopropyl ester (ie) can be reproduced by combining other pg-subtype-selective compounds. iop was lowered by approximately 25% after 4–5 days of topical administration with  xxxd2446xxx  (fp agonist, 1.5 mug, q.d.),  xxxd340xxx  ( xxxd340xxx , whose metabolites have
been shown to be fp agonists; 9 mug, q.d.), or  xxxd3414xxx  (fp agonist, 1.2 mug, q.d) or the  xxxg1873xxx  agonist, butaprost
(25 mug, b.i.d.). the ep1 agonist, 17-phenyl trinor (pht) pge2 (b.i.d.), and ep3 agonist, sulprostone (b.i.d.), had no
iop-lowering effects. the addition of butaprost, sulprostone (10 mug), or 17phtpge2 (25 mug) to  xxxd2446xxx  did not
lower iop more than  xxxd2446xxx  alone. however, treatment with the combination of  xxxd2446xxx , 17phtpge2,
butaprost, and sulprostone produced a similar 50–55% reduction in iop, as did pgf2alpha-ie (b.i.d.). in conclusion,
 xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd340xxx  produce similar iop-lowering responses in normotensive monkeys and
are most efficacious when administered q.d. pm, compared to b.i.d. the combination of the fp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and
ep3 agonists used in this study was sufficient to lower iop by the same magnitude as pgf2alpha-ie, suggesting that
combining pg-subtype agonists may be a potent antiglaucoma strategy.

introduction

pgf2alpha has a substantial affinity for ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx 
pg receptor subtypes as well as for fp receptors.2,8 therefore,
it may be possible to add subtype-selective pg agonists to the
current clinical fp-selective analogs 9 to produce additional
iop-lowering efficacy without increased side effects.
we first directly compared the iop responses of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  in monkeys that
responded strongly to pgf2alpha-ie and found that there was no
difference in iop-lowering efficacy. therefore, subsequent
studies were conducted by adding other ep-selective subtype compounds to  xxxd2446xxx . then, the most effective
iop-lowering combination of  xxxd2446xxx  and available ep
agonists was compared to that of pgf2alpha-ie.

p

rostaglandin (pg) analogs are the most potent, efficacious topical ocular hypotensive agents currently known
for the treatment of human glaucoma.1 the most effective
pgs for lowering intraocular pressure (iop) in humans
are derivatives of pgf2alpha modified structurally to enhance
ocular penetration and, after metabolism to the free acid,
specifically activate the fp-prostanoid receptor.2 the most
undesirable side effects have also been eliminated as a result
of these modifications (historic reviews 3,4).
in normotensive monkeys, pgf2alpha- isopropyl ester (ie) dramatically lowers iop following 3–5 days of twice-daily topical treatment before the onset of any adverse ocular effects.5
however, direct comparison in monkeys of pgf2alpha-ie to three
of the most commonly prescribed pg analogs for glaucoma
therapy in the united states,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and
 xxxd3414xxx ,6,7 has not been done. therefore, it is unknown if
maximum iop-lowering capability with pg derivatives has
been achieved.

methods
all animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the university of wisconsin (madison, wi) iacuc and
national institutes of health (nih; bethesda, md) guidelines.

gabelt et al.

animals and anesthesia
thirty-five (35) ocular normotensive cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) (both sexes, 3.1–7.6 kg) were studied, usually in groups of 4, 8, or 9. all monkeys were free of
any ocular abnormalities. the monkeys were anesthetized
with intramuscular (i.m.) ketamine (10 mg/kg, initial, supplement 5 mg/kg, as needed) for drug administration and
iop measurements. lactated ringer’s fluids (10 ml/kg)
were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 2–3 times during
the course of the 6- and 8-h iop studies.

drug administration
the following agents from cayman chemical (ann arbor,
mi) were studied: pgf2alpha-ie (2 mug);  xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 or 4.5 mug);
 xxxd340xxx  (9 or 27 mug);  xxxd3414xxx  (1.2 or 3.6 mug;); 17-phenyl trinor (pht) pge 2 (25 mug, 50 mug; ep1>ep3 selective 10,11);
butaprost (25 mug, 50 mug;  xxxg1873xxx  selective 11,12); and sulprostone (5
mug, 10 mug, 50 mug; ep3>ep1 selective 11,13,14).
if solvent was present, it was first blown off with a stream
of nitrogen passed through a 0.2-mum filter. stock solutions
of the study agents were prepared in 100%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and kept at –20ºc. with some noted exceptions,
treatment solutions and vehicles were formulated in 20%
dmso/phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and were given as
two 5-mul drops (unless otherwise noted) administered to
the central cornea of the supine, anesthetized monkeys. this
vehicle was chosen to minimize sources of confounding due
to formulation variations in clinical preparations.
the eyelid was held open for 30 sec following administration, and 1 min elapsed between drops. when a given eye
received more than one drug solution during a given treatment
session, the agents were separated by 5 min. once- (pm) and
twice-daily treatment regimens for 4–5 days were evaluated.

iop, slit-lamp examination
before drug administration, slit-lamp examination (sle)
ensured that no inflammation was present and that the eyes
were normal. baseline iop (with nondairy creamer as the
interface)15 was measured by goldmann applanation tonometry.16 for  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  comparisons, animals were selected that demonstrated at least a
5-mmhg iop reduction at 3–4 h on day 4 of b.i.d. treatment
with 2 mug pgf 2alpha-ie. these animals were studied in groups
of 3 as follows:

some of these animals were included in the remainder
of the studies; no prescreening was done for any additional
animals that were used.
iop measurements for once-daily (q.d.) treatments were
performed at 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20, and sometimes 36 h, and
sle at 14 and 20 h after the last treatment, usually given at
approximately 7:30–8:00 pm on day 4. iop measurements
for twice-daily (b.i.d.) treatments were taken prior to and at

0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h (also  xxxd2274xxx  and 8 h for studies including
butaprost), and sle prior to, and at 3 and 6 h after, either the
seventh or ninth treatment. the monkeys were allowed to
recover for at least 2 weeks between experiments.

data analysis
the percentage change in iop between treated and control eyes for pretreatment baseline, or for treated or control
eyes compared to pretreatment baseline, was calculated as
follows:
{[(t – bl)/bl] – [(c – bl)/bl]} × 100%
or [(t – bl)/bl] × 100%
or [(c – bl)/bl] × 100%
where t = experimental eye; c = vehicle or control eye; and
bl = baseline prior to the first treatment. data are given as
the mean ± standard error of the mean. significance was
determined by the two-tailed paired t-test for differences
compared to 0.0.

results
comparison of iop responses of  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and pgf2alpha-ie
iop responses following once-daily pm treatments. the clinical doses of  xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug),  xxxd340xxx  (9 mug), and
 xxxd3414xxx  (1.2 mug) were equally effective in significantly
lowering iop by approximately 25% from hours 12–20 following the fourth treatment (p < 0.001 at 12–20h; p < 0.005 at
36h; fig. 1a). despite the apparent trend toward a lower iop
response with q.d. pgf2alpha-ie (1.6 mug in this case) there was no
significant difference in percent change in iop compared to
that of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx , when the
same 4 monkeys were compared from each group.
iop response was also determined at 3x the clinical
doses of each compound,  xxxd2446xxx  (4.5 mug),  xxxd340xxx 
(27 mug), and  xxxd3414xxx  (3.6 mug), administered q.d. in subsets
of 3 animals (fig. 1b). agents were given in 6 × 5 mul drops.
comparisons of the results to those for the corresponding
animals studied by using the clinical doses described above
suggested no enhancement of the iop-lowering response;
therefore, additional animals were not studied. the combined data from the three compounds (3 different animals
for each compound; therefore, n = 9) also indicated that the
1x dose of each compound was as effective as the 3x dose at
16–20 h after the fourth treatment.

iop responses following twice-daily treatments
twice-daily treatment with the clinical dose of  xxxd2446xxx 
(1.5 mug) caused slight and variable decreases in iop measured prior to, and for, 6 h following the seventh treatment.
 xxxd340xxx  (9 mug) had essentially no effect on iop during
this time. in contrast, previous screening of these animals
for their iop responsiveness to pgf2alpha-ie demonstrated a significant and dramatic decrease in iop of nearly 50% (p <
0.001) at 3–4 h after the seventh dose. for screening studies
only (fig. 1c), the pgf2alpha-ie dose (2 mug), was formulated in
5 mul containing 0.4% tween 80/pbs. for subsequent studies,
pgf2alpha-ie was formulated in 20% dmso/pbs, as were other
compounds, as stated in methods. as can be seen in table 1

fig. 1. intraocular pressure (iop) following once- or twice-daily treatments with  xxxd2446xxx  (lat),  xxxd340xxx  (bim),
 xxxd3414xxx  (trav), and/or pgf2alpha-isopropyl ester (ie). (a) monkeys were treated once-daily in the pm with lat (1.5 mug), bim
(9 mug), trav (1.2 mug), or pgf2alpha-ie (1.6 mug) in 2 × 5 mul of 20%  xxxd1896xxx /phosphate-buffered saline (dmso/pbs). iop
was measured the next day, beginning 12 h after the last dose. lat, bim, and trav all lowered iop by approximately 25%,
but were slightly, although not significantly, less effective than pgf2alpha-ie. (b) subsets of 3 monkeys were treated once-daily in
the pm with 3x the clinical doses of lat (4.5 mug), bim (27 mug), or trav (3.6 mug) in 6 × 5 mul of 20% dmso/pbs and iop measured as in a. iop lowering was no greater than with the 1x clinical doses used in a, even when the data from the 3 drugs
were combined. (c) twice-daily administration of lat (1.5 mug) and bim (9 mug) was less effective in lowering iop than oncedaily administration. twice-daily treatment with pgf2alpha-ie (2 mug in 5 mul of 0.4% tween 80/pbs) was the most effective ioplowering regimen. see table 1 for initial iop values and summary. significantly different from 0.0: *p < 0.05, minimum.

(panels 1c vs. 3e and 3f), there was no diminution of the iop
response to pgf2alpha-ie (and, presumably, all the other compounds studied) by formulation in 20% dmso/pbs instead
of tween 80/pbs.
following the iop measurements shown in figure 1c,
the corresponding monkeys received the eighth dose of
 xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug) or  xxxd340xxx  (9 mug). the next day, 12–20
h after the eighth dose, iop measurements were repeated.
neither agent consistently decreased iop, compared to baseline, prior to the first treatment (not shown).

iop dose responses to b.i.d. 17phtpge2,
sulprostone, and butaprost
there was essentially no change in iop prior to, and
for, 6 h following the seventh doses of b.i.d. treatment with
17phtpge2 (25 or 50 mug) or sulprostone (5, 10, or 50 mug;
fig. 2a and 2c). the 50-mug dose of sulprostone was formulated in 2 × 5 mul drops of 30% dmso/pbs.
butaprost significantly (p < 0.05, minimum) decreased
iop by approximately 15–30% from hours 4–7 following the
seventh 25-mug dose of b.i.d. treatment (fig. 2b, 2d, and 2e).
no greater response was attained with the 50-mug dose. the
50-mug dose of butaprost was formulated in 2 × 5 mul drops of
30% dmso/pbs.
the addition of 17phtpge2 (25 mug) or sulprostone (10 mug)
to 25 mug of butaprost (fig. 2d and 2e) did not significantly
alter the iop-lowering response to butaprost alone.

additivity of butaprost and sulprostone, or
17phtpge2, butaprost, sulprostone, in combination
with  xxxd2446xxx ; comparison to pgf2alpha-ie
 xxxd2446xxx  was used in subsequent subtype combination
studies, since there was no difference in the iop-lowering response to  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , or  xxxd3414xxx , as shown
in figure 1.

first, 17phtpge2 (25 mug; fig. 3a), butaprost (25 mug; fig.
3b), or sulprostone (10 mug; fig. 3c) was administered b.i.d.
to one eye;  xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug) was administered q.d. in the
afternoon to both eyes. for the afternoon treatment, 17phtpge2, butaprost, or sulprostone was administered first.
 xxxd2446xxx  was administered 5 min later. on day 5, 17phtpge2, butaprost, or sulprostone was administered immediately after the 12-h post- xxxd2446xxx  iop measurement.
compared to baseline iop prior to the initial treatment,
 xxxd2446xxx  alone decreased iop on day 5 by approximately
15–22% from 14 to 18 h after the fourth  xxxd2446xxx  treatment
(fig. 3a, 3b, and 3c; table 1).  xxxd2446xxx  in combination
with 17phtpge2 or butaprost may have slightly enhanced
the iop-lowering response to  xxxd2446xxx  alone, although
differences between the eyes were not significant at any
time points.  xxxd2446xxx  in combination with sulprostone
may have slightly attenuated the iop-lowering response to
 xxxd2446xxx  alone, but no differences were significant.
sulprostone (10 mug) and butaprost (25 mug) formulated together in a single solution were administered b.i.d. to one eye;
 xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug) was administered q.d. in the afternoon to
both eyes. for the afternoon treatment, sulprostone+butaprost
or vehicle were administered first.  xxxd2446xxx  was administered 5 min later. on day 5, sulprostone+butaprost were
administered immediately after the 12-h post- xxxd2446xxx 
iop measurement. the combination of  xxxd2446xxx  with
sulprostone+butaprost further decreased iop by an additional
15% at the 16–18-h time points (p < 0.05; n = 11), compared to
 xxxd2446xxx  alone (fig. 3d).
in another series of experiments, treatment with the
combination of sulprostone+butaprost+ xxxd2446xxx , as described above, was then compared to b.i.d. pgf2alpha-ie (2 mug).
compared to initial baseline iop prior to the first treatment, the combination of  xxxd2446xxx +sulprostone+butaprost decreased iop by approximately 30–40% from 14 to
16 h after the fourth  xxxd2446xxx  treatment (2–4 h after the
ninth sulprostone+butaprost treatment). however, pgf2alpha-ie

fig. 2. effect of 17phtpge2, butaprost, sulprostone, and their combinations on intraocular pressure (iop). (a) unilateral
17phtpge2 (25, 50 mug) b.i.d. had no effect on iop on day 4. (b) unilateral butaprost (25, 50 mug) b.i.d. lowered iop by approximately 15% on day 4. (c) unilateral sulprostone (5, 10, and 50 mug) administered b.i.d. had no effect on iop on day 4. the
combination of (d) butaprost (25 mug) and 17phtpge2 (25 mug) or (e) butaprost and sulprostone (10 mug) did not lower iop any
more than butaprost alone in the contralateral eye. data for a, b, and c are the difference in %delta in treated and control eyes
corrected for the initial iop prior to the first treatment. data for d and e are the %delta in iop corrected for the initial iop prior
to the first treatment. see table 1 for initial iop values and summary. the 50-mug doses of sulprostone and butaprost were
formulated in 2 × 5 mul of 30%  xxxd1896xxx /phosphate-buffered saline (dmso/pbs). all other doses were formulated
in 2 × 5 mul of 20% dmso/pbs. significantly different than 0.0: *p < 0.05, minimum.

decreased iop by an additional 20% or more following the
ninth dose (p < 0.05; n = 8; fig. 3e).
last, all three ep subtype-selective agonists were formulated together in a single solution, that is, 17phtpge2
(25 mug)+sulprostone (10 mug)+butaprost (25 mug) and administered b.i.d. to one eye, and pgf2alpha-ie (2 mug) b.i.d. to the
opposite eye.  xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug) was administered q.d.
in the afternoon to the ep agonist–treated eye. on day 5,
17phtpge2+sulprostone+butaprost or pgf2alpha-ie were administered immediately after the 12-h post– xxxd2446xxx  iop
measurement to the corresponding eyes. the combination
of  xxxd2446xxx  with 17phtpge2+sulprostone+butaprost decreased iop on day 5 at 4 h post-treatment by 52%, whereas
pgf2alpha-ie decreased iop by 58% (fig. 3f). there were no significant differences in iop-lowering response between the
eyes at any time point.

slit-lamp examinations
all eyes were free of biomicroscopic cells and flare, except in 4 different monkeys receiving butaprost alone or in
combination with sulprostone or sulprostone and  xxxd2446xxx . in both eyes 1+, trace or rare cells were present. in 2
cases, the measurements were discontinued and the data not
included. in 2 other cases (rare or trace cells), the data were
calculated with and without those monkeys. since there was
no difference in the results with or without those monkeys,
the data were included.

discussion
clinical doses of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx 
administered q.d. pm produced maximal iop-lowering
responses in normotensive monkeys, compared to b.i.d

treatments or threefold higher doses given q.d.  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd340xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  were similar in their efficacies. prescreening the monkeys for strong responsiveness
to pgf2alpha-ie may have eliminated some variability in iop
efficacies, as reported in humans, where nonresponders to
 xxxd2446xxx  may still respond to  xxxd340xxx .17–19
the ep1 (ep1>ep3) agonist 17phtpge2 had little effect on
iop alone or in combination with butaprost or  xxxd2446xxx .
the  xxxg1872xxx  was shown to mediate the iop-lowering
response to pgf2alpha in cats.10 ep1 and ep3 receptors were
shown to be prominently expressed in human ciliary body
and cornea 20 as well as in trabecular cells.21  xxxg1872xxx 
mrna transcripts were present in all muscle fibers of the
human ciliary body.22 it is also possible the b.i.d. treatment
regimen utilized in the current study may not be optimal, as
was the case with  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx .
the  xxxg1873xxx  agonist, butaprost, lowered iop similarly to what
has been previously reported.23 the addition of butaprost to
 xxxd2446xxx  did not significantly enhance the iop-lowering
response to  xxxd2446xxx . immunohistochemistry studies showed that  xxxg1873xxx  receptors were the most abundantly
expressed ep subtype in human ocular tissues.20
the ep3 (ep3 ≥ ep111,13,14) agonist, sulprostone, had very
little effect on iop when used alone. this is in contrast to
early studies in monkeys, where a 2.5–3-mmhg reduction
was reported after a single 25-mug dose of sulprostone or an
~4-mmhg reduction after twice-daily treatment with 25
mug of another ep3 agonist, mb 28767.24 the addition of sulprostone to  xxxd2446xxx  did not further enhance the ioplowering response. in ep and  xxxg1878xxx  knockout mice,
part of the ocular hypotensive response to the pgf2alpha analog,  xxxd3274xxx , were found to be mediated by ep3 receptors.25 similarly, in knockout mice, it was concluded that the
 xxxg1874xxx  plays a role in the iop-lowering response to

fig. 3. additivity of intraocular pressure (iop) effects of 17phtpge2, butaprost, and sulprostone with  xxxd2446xxx ; comparison to pgf2alpha-isopropyl ester (ie). the combination of  xxxd2446xxx  (1.5 mug, q.d.) and (a) 17phtpge2 (25 mug, b.i.d.), (b)
butaprost (25 mug, b.i.d.), or (c) sulprostone (10 mug, b.i.d.) had no greater iop-lowering effect on day 5 than  xxxd2446xxx  alone.
(d) the combination of  xxxd2446xxx +butaprost+sulprostone lowered iop more than  xxxd2446xxx  alone. (e) pgf2alpha-ie (2 mug,
b.i.d.) was significantly more effective in lowering iop than the combination of latanonprost+butaprost+sulprostone. (f)
the magnitude of the iop-lowering response to pgf2alpha-ie was matched by combining  xxxd2446xxx +17phtpge2+butaprost+
sulprostone. data are the %delta from the initial iop prior to the first treatment. see table 1 for initial iop values and summary.
all treatments were formulated in 2 × 5 mul of 20%  xxxd1896xxx /phosphate-buffered saline. significantly different
from 0.0: *p < 0.05, minimum. significantly different from the opposite eye: § p < 0.05, minimum.
 xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd340xxx .26 this is in contrast to what would be expected from in vitro receptor binding 2,14 and functional assays,2 in which fp-receptor binding
and functional responses (e.g., phosphoinositide turnover)
were at least two orders of magnitude greater than for ep3
receptors. the  xxxg1874xxx  has also been detected in trabecular cells in human donor eyes.21
it was hypothesized that the fp+ xxxg1873xxx +ep3 combination
would give the greatest effect, based on individual agonist
iop-lowering studies conducted in monkeys by other investigators.23,24 combined therapy with  xxxd2446xxx +sulprostone+
butaprost decreased iop more that  xxxd2446xxx  alone, but the
iop-lowering response was not as great as with the nonselective agonist, pgf2alpha-ie, in normotensive cynomolgus
monkeys (table 1). however, the addition of the ep1 agonist,
17phtpge2, to the combination of  xxxd2446xxx +sulprostone
+butaprost did reproduce the magnitude and time course
of the iop-lowering response to pgf2alpha-ie. perhaps pg subtypes, which alone have no effect on iop, may act in synergistic ways to enhance iop reduction when combined with
current iop-lowering pg compounds. the combination of
 xxxd2446xxx +17phtpge2+butaprost was not tested, so it is
not known if sulprostone is necessary in the formulation
to reproduce the magnitude of the pgf2alpha-ie iop-lowering
response. once-daily treatment with the other compounds
should be investigated as well in order to possibly further
optimize the iop-lowering responses and minimize side
effects. also, there was no analysis of the combined formulation to determine if any alteration of the individual

components occurred when they were combined that could
have contributed to the response.
the  xxxg1875xxx  agonist, ono-123a, has been reported to increase outflow facility by 43% in monkeys after a single
dose.27 another  xxxg1875xxx  agonist, 3,7-dithia  xxxd124xxx , did not relax
primate ciliary muscle precontracted with carbachol.28 pgf2alpha
is known to effectively bind to  xxxg1875xxx  receptors.2 no further enhancement would be expected by the addition of an  xxxg1875xxx  agonist, since the magnitude of the pgf2alpha-ie iop lowering was
achieved with the combination of the fp+ep1+ xxxg1873xxx +ep3
agonists.* however, this does not exclude the possibility
that the addition of the  xxxg1875xxx  agonist to pgf2alpha-ie, or to the
combination that equaled it, might produce iop lowering
beyond either of those. it is also possible that an  xxxg1875xxx  agonist might be substituted for one of the others to produce
the same, or more consistent, iop-lowering response and to
eliminate adverse side effects, such as were encountered in
some instances with butaprost.

conclusions
pgf2alpha-ie lowers iop in vivo by primarily increasing uveoscleral outflow 29,30 with variable, if any, effects on total outflow facility and no apparent effects on trabecular outflow
facility.31 similar morphologic changes of the uveoscleral

* xxxg1875xxx  agonists were not studied due to a legal impass regarding
material transfer agreements.

prostaglandin subtype effects on iop
pathway in monkeys have been shown after long-term treatment with  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and fp agonists.32 increased scleral permeability also seems of similar magnitude with pgf2alpha and
 xxxd2446xxx .33,34 therefore, combined therapy may be useful
for short-term enhancement of iop reduction, but long-term
effectiveness may be similar, regardless of the receptor subtypes stimulated.
