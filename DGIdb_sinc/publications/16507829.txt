ret is a single-pass transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  receptor
and is part of a cell-surface complex that binds growth factors of
the glial-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (gdnf) family in association with four different coreceptors, gfralpha1–4 (1). the ret
gene is a potent oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of
several human tumors. in papillary thyroid carcinoma (2), chromosomal inversions or translocations cause the in-frame fusion
of the  xxxg2198xxx -encoding domain of ret with the 5′-end
of heterologous genes. the resulting ret/papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) chimeric sequences are oncogenic. the most
frequent rearrangements are ret/ xxxg1867xxx  and ret/ptc3 formed
326 articles

by the fusion with the h4/d10s170 or the rfg/ele1genes,
respectively (1). virtually all of the translocated amino termini
that have been found to be fused to ret are predicted to fold
into coiled coils. these motifs provide ret/ptc kinases with
the ability to undergo ligand-independent dimerization and
allow constitutive activation of ret. moreover, the promoters
of the fused gene drive the expression of the rearranged ret
alleles (1).
germline point mutations in ret cause the dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (men) type 2a and 2b and
familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. men 2 patients are affected by medullary thyroid carcinoma, a malignant tumor that
arises from calcitonin-secreting c cells. familial medullary thyroid carcinoma predisposes patients to medullary thyroid carcinoma alone, whereas other features can be associated with men
2a (pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and hereditary localized pruritus) and men 2b (pheochromocytoma, ganglioneuromatosis of the intestine, thickening of corneal nerves,
and marfanoid habitus) (3–5). most men 2b patients carry the
m918t mutation in the ret kinase domain, and only a small
fraction harbor the a883f substitution (4,5). most men 2a and
familial medullary thyroid carcinoma patients carry mutations
that affect a cysteine residue in the extracellular cysteine-rich
domain of ret (most often c634). familial medullary thyroid
carcinoma is also associated with changes in the n-terminal
(e768d, l790f, y791f, v804l, and v804m) or c-terminal
(s891a) regions of the ret kinase (3–5). point substitutions
at v804, m918, and e768 are found in approximately 30% of
patients with sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (3–5). the
mechanisms that lead to ret oncogenic conversion in men 2
depend on the location of the amino acid change. extracellular
cysteine mutants display constitutive kinase activity after homodimerization. constitutive activation and altered substrate
specificity have been implicated in the case of ret intracellular
domain mutations (1).
although ret kinase is constitutively active in both papillary thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, the
diseases are physiologically different. local disease control by
surgical resection, adjuvant radioiodine treatment, and thyroid
hormone replacement are the cornerstones of treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma (2). however, if this treatment fails,
patients may succumb to the disease (6). early diagnosis and

background: medullary and papillary thyroid carcinomas
are often associated with oncogenic activation of the ret
 xxxg2198xxx . we evaluated whether the biaryl urea bay
43-9006, which is known to inhibit several other tyrosine
kinases, blocks ret kinase function and oncogenic activity.
methods: we examined  xxxd3226xxx  activity against oncogenic ret in vitro and in cellular ret signaling in oncogenic
ret-transfected nih3t3 fibroblasts by using immunocomplex kinase assays and immunoblotting with phospho-specific
antibodies. the effects of  xxxd3226xxx  on proliferation of
human tpc1 and tt thyroid carcinoma cells, which harbor
spontaneous oncogenic ret alleles, and on rat1 fibroblasts
transformed with oncogenic ret mutants, including mutants
that are resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents, were
determined using growth curves and flow cytometry. growth
of tt cell–derived xenograft tumors in athymic mice treated
orally with  xxxd3226xxx  or with vehicle was measured. all
statistical tests were two-sided. results:  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited oncogenic ret kinase activity at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) of 50 nm or less in nih3t3 cells.
it also arrested the growth of nih3t3 and rat1 fibroblasts
transformed by oncogenic ret and of thyroid carcinoma
cells that harbor spontaneous oncogenic ret alleles. moreover,  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited the growth of cells carrying ret
v804l (ic50 = 110 nm, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 88 to
133 nm) or ret v804m (ic50 = 147 nm, 95% ci = 123 nm
to 170 nm), both mutants that are resistant to anilinoquinazolines and pyrazolopyrimidines. after 3 weeks of oral
treatment with  xxxd3226xxx  (60 mg/kg/day), the volume of
tt cell xenografts (n = 7) was reduced from 72.5 to 44 mm3
(difference = 28.5 mm3, 95% ci = 7 mm3 to 50 mm3), whereas
in vehicle-treated mice (n = 7), mean tumor volume increased
to 408 mm3 (difference = 320 mm3, 95% ci = 180 mm3 to 460
mm3; untreated versus treated, p =.02). this inhibition paralleled a decrease in ret phosphorylation. conclusions: bay
43-9006 is a powerful inhibitor of the ret kinase. its potential as a therapeutic tool for ret-positive thyroid tumors,
including those expressing v804 mutations merits study.

treatment are essential for the survival of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, because the disease does not respond to
standard chemotherapy or to conventional radiotherapy. unfortunately, medullary thyroid carcinoma is often incurable because the cancer has metastasized to regional lymph nodes or
distant sites before diagnosis. thus, for many patients with hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma and for some
patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, there is no effective
treatment (6).
protein kinases have become one of the most important targets for anticancer drug development. the approval of imatinib
(gleevec) for chronic myeloid leukemia and gefitinib (iressa)
and  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva) for non–small-cell lung cancer has provided proof of the principle of the effectiveness of small-molecule
kinase inhibitors (7). the causative role played by ret germline
mutations in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (3–5), the
presence of ret alterations in very early phases of papillary
thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma (8), and the
ability of ret oncogenes to initiate tumor formation in tissuespecific transgenic animals (8) make ret a prime target for
thyroid cancer therapies. small molecules of various chemical
classes have been reported to inhibit ret; these include two
pyrazolopyrimidines (pp1 and  xxxd1307xxx ) (9–11), the 2-indolinone
rpi-1 (12), two indolocarbazole derivatives ( xxxd2458xxx  and cep751) (13), and the anilinoquinazoline zd6474, which is in an
advanced phase of clinical study (14,15). a methionine or leucine
substitution for valine 804 (v804m and v804l) in ret confers
resistance to zd6474, pp1, and  xxxd1307xxx  (16). v804 mutations are
present alone or with other ret mutations in men 2 carriers
(approximately 4% of patients) and in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma patients (4,17–23). v804 in ret corresponds
to residues in abl (t315) (24),  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) (t790) (25,26), kit (t670) (27), and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor a ( xxxg1709xxx ) (t674) (28), whose mutation mediates resistance to inhibitors of various chemical
classes.
 xxxd3226xxx  is a biaryl urea that targets the serine/threonine
kinases  xxxg1924xxx  and braf (29,30) and the  xxxg2198xxx  receptors  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ),  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ),  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b, and
kit (30).  xxxd3226xxx  is an orally available cytostatic agent that
is undergoing advanced clinical trials (30). in this study, we exploit the ability of  xxxd3226xxx  to inhibit ret activity/signaling
and the autonomous growth and tumorigenicity of human cell
lines carrying oncogenic ret alleles.

mutation (34), was cultured in rpmi-1640 with 20% fetal
calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillinstreptomycin (gibco). parental fischer rat–derived rat1
fibroblasts and rat1 transformed by ret/c634r, ret/v804l,
or ret/v804m are described elsewhere (35) and were cultured
in dmem with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and
100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (gibco). all ret constructs used in this study encoded the short isoform of the ret
protein (ret-9) (1).
in vitro kinase assays

growth curves and cell cycle analysis
nih3t3 (10 000/dish) and rat1 fibroblasts (10 000/dish) and
human thyroid carcinoma tpc1 (35 000/dish) and tt (90 000/
dish) cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes. fibroblasts were maintained in medium supplemented with 1% calf (nih3t3) or fetal
calf (rat1) serum. human cells were maintained in 2% (tpc1)
or 10% (tt) fetal calf serum. the next day,  xxxd3226xxx  or vehicle was added to the medium and changed every 2 days. cells
were counted every 2 (fibroblasts) or 2–3 (human cell lines) days.
for flow cytometry analysis, cells were grown to subconfluence
in 100-mm dishes and then treated with vehicle or 1.0 mum bay
43-9006 for 24 hours. after harvesting, cells were fixed in cold
70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline. cells were washed
and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
(25 mug/ml) was added, and samples were analyzed with a
facscalibur flow cytometer (becton dickinson, san jose, ca)
interfaced with a hewlett packard computer (palo alto, ca).

for the in vitro ret autophosphorylation assay, subconfluent nih3t3 cells stably transfected with ret/ptc3 were solubilized in lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors (sodium
fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium vanadate). then,
200 mug of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ret;
immunocomplexes were recovered with protein a–sepharose
beads, washed five times with kinase buffer (20 mm hepes
at ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% triton x-100,
15 mm mncl2, and 15 mm mgcl2) and incubated 20 minutes
at room temperature in kinase buffer containing 2.5 muci of
[gamma-32p]atp and unlabeled atp (20 mum) (9). samples were
separated by 10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. gels were dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. signal intensity was analyzed using a phosphorimager (typhoon 8600) interfaced with the imagequant software.
for phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate, ret immunocomplexes were incubated (20 minutes at room temperature)
in kinase buffer containing 200 mum poly-( xxxd2431xxx -ltyrosine [poly-gt]) (sigma), 2.5 muci of [gamma-32p]atp, and unlabeled atp (20 mum). samples were spotted on whatman 3mm
paper (springfield mill, uk), and 32p incorporation was
measured with a beta counter scintillator (beckman coulter,
unterschleissheim-lohhof, germany). each experiment was
performed at least three times.

at the dipartimento di biologia e patologia cellulare e molecolare (university of naples “federico ii,” naples, italy). this
study was conducted in accordance with italian regulations for
experimentation on animals. all manipulations were performed
while mice were under isoflurane gas anesthesia. no mouse
showed signs of wasting or other signs of toxicity. tt cells
(1 × 107/mouse) were inoculated subcutaneously into the right
dorsal portion of 4-week-old male balb/c nu/nu mice (the
jackson laboratory, bar harbor, me). when tumors measured
~70 mm3, after approximately 30 days, mice were randomized
to receive  xxxd3226xxx  (n = 7, 60 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (n =
7, cremophor el–ethanol) alone by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days/week for 3 weeks. tumor diameters were measured at
regular intervals with calipers. tumor volumes (v) were calculated with the formula: v = a × b2/2 (a = axial diameter; b =
rotational diameter). mice were killed by cervical dislocation,
and tumors were excised and divided in two parts. half of
the tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for protein extraction. the other half was fixed overnight in neutral

buffered formalin and processed by routine methods. paraffinembedded blocks were sliced into 5-mum sections and stained by
hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination or processed
for immunohistochemistry.
statistical analysis
kinase activity curves were graphed using the curve-fitting
prism software (graphpad software). to compare cell growth
we used the unpaired student’s t test (normal distributions and
equal variances) and the jmp software program (version 5.1.1;
sas institute, inc, austin, tx). to compare tumor growth we
used the paired student’s t test (normal distributions and equal
variances) and the jmp software program (version 5.1.1; sas
institute), an analysis of variance (linear mixed-effect model) test
for repeated measures and the wilcoxon’s rank-sum test and the
instat software program (graphpad software). all p values were
two-sided, and differences were statistically significant at p<.02.

 xxxd3226xxx  effects on oncogenic ret
autophosphorylation in vitro
oncogenic ret proteins undergo autophosphorylation in vitro
in the absence of ligand (32). we used an in vitro autophosphorylation assay to determine whether  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited
the autophosphorylation of ret/ptc3 (i.e., oncogenic variant)
kinase immunopurified from stably transfected nih3t3 cells.

inhibition of ret signaling and cell proliferation in
ret-transformed cells by  xxxd3226xxx 
we next determined whether  xxxd3226xxx  could also inhibit the kinase activity of oncogenic ret mutants in intact
cells. we treated nih3t3 fibroblasts expressing one of three
oncogenic versions of ret (ret/ptc3, ret/c634r, or ret/
m918t) with  xxxd3226xxx  for 2 hours. we then measured ret
phosphorylation levels by immunoblotting with an antibody
that recognizes ret only when it is phosphorylated at tyrosine
905 (y905) (10,36). treatment with  xxxd3226xxx  reduced
the  xxxd1075xxx  content of ret/ptc3, ret/c634r, and
ret/m918t with an ic50 of 20–50 nm (fig. 2, b–d). the three
ret kinases were almost completely inhibited by 100 nm
 xxxd3226xxx  (fig. 2, b–d). we used two cell systems to test
whether  xxxd3226xxx  could also inhibit wild-type ret:
nih3t3 fibroblasts that express the egfr/ret chimera (in
which the ret kinase can be stimulated by egf) and those that
coexpress wild-type ret and gfralpha1 (in which the ret kinase
can be stimulated by gdnf) (fig. 2, a).  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited autophosphorylation of both egfr/ret and wild-type
ret (fig. 2, e–f).

 xxxd3226xxx  inhibited ret/ptc3 autophosphorylation with an
ic50 of roughly 50 nm (fig 1, a). we performed a second in vitro
enzymatic assay to measure the ability of ret/ptc3 to phosphorylate a synthetic poly-gt substrate.  xxxd3226xxx  blocked this
activity of ret/ptc3 with an ic50 of 47 nm (95% ci = 34 nm
to 61 nm) (fig. 1, b).

representative blot from three independent experiments is shown. b) the indicated
cell lines were incubated with dmso or 1.0 mum  xxxd3226xxx  in 1% calf serum,
and the cells were counted at different time points. each point represents the mean
value for five dishes, and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. p values
were determined by the two-tailed unpaired student’s t test. *p<.001.

constitutively active oncogenic versions of ret activate the
ras/raf/mapk pathway by recruiting grb2/sos complexes
through the shc protein (1,37). accordingly, we treated ret/ptc3
cells with increasing concentrations of  xxxd3226xxx  and analyzed
shc and  xxxd1355xxx / xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation by immunoblotting with
phospho-specific antibodies.  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited ret/ptc3dependent phosphorylation of shc and  xxxd1355xxx /42mapk with an ic50
of approximately 50 nm (fig. 3, a). similar results were obtained
with ret/c634r and ret/m918t mutants (not shown).
we studied the effects exerted by  xxxd3226xxx  on the growth
of nih3t3 cells transformed by ret/ptc3, ret/c634r, and
ret/m918t that were grown in low serum (2.5%) for 10 days.
proliferation of nih3t3 cells transformed with any of these ret
mutants was virtually arrested after treatment with 1 mum of bay
43-9006 (fig. 3, b). fewer ret/ptc3 cells remained after treatment with 1 mum of  xxxd3226xxx  than after treatment with vehicle (8.4 × 103, 95% ci = 7.2 × 103 to 9.6 × 103 versus 730.5 ×
103, 95% ci = 684 × 103 to 776 × 103; p<.001). results were
similar for ret/c634r and ret/m918t cells after treatment
with 1 mum of  xxxd3226xxx  or with vehicle (ret/c634r cells,
8.1 × 103, 95% ci = 6.7 × 103 to 9.6 × 103, versus 552 × 103, 95%
ci = 509 × 103 to 594 × 103; p<.001; and ret/m918t cells,
11 × 103, 95% ci = 7.9 × 103 to 14 × 103, versus 612 x 103, 95%
ci = 591 × 103 to 634 × 103 p<.001). hence,  xxxd3226xxx 
antagonized ret oncogenic activity by blocking its kinase function and its signaling and mitogenic effects.

we next investigated the effects of  xxxd3226xxx  on the tpc1
cell line, which is derived from a human ptc bearing the ret/
 xxxg1867xxx  rearrangement (33), and the tt cell line, which is derived
from a human mtc harboring the ret/c634w mutation (34).
treatment of either cell line with 100 nm  xxxd3226xxx  almost
completely abrogated ret and shc phosphorylation (fig. 4, a
and b). this treatment abrogated  xxxd1355xxx /p42 mapk phosphorylation in tt cells and strongly reduced it (by approximately 50%)
in tpc1 cells (fig. 4, a and b).
we next measured the growth rates of tpc1 (grown in 2%
serum) and tt (grown in 10% serum) cells treated with three

nih3t3 cells transfected with ret/papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) 3 were serumstarved for 24 hours and then treated with vehicle ( xxxd1896xxx  [dmso]) or
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3226xxx . cell lysates (50 mug) were immunoblotted

the two-tailed unpaired student’s t test. *p<.002. d) after 24 hours of serum
starvation, tpc1 and tt cells were treated with vehicle or with 1.0 mum bay
43-9006 for 24 hours and subjected to flow cytometry. the percentages of cells
in the sub-g1 (apoptotic), g0/g1, s, and g2/m compartments are indicated.

confidence intervals are shown.

(109 × 103, 95% ci = 100 × 103 to 118 × 103, versus 541 × 103, 95%
ci = 487 × 103 to 584 × 103; p<.001). the number of tt cells
remaining after 10 days of treatment with 250 nm  xxxd3226xxx 
was lower than that after treatment with vehicle (199 × 103,
95% ci = 187 × 103 to 211 × 103, versus 541 × 103, 95% ci =
487 × 103 to 584 × 103; p<.001). we also observed growth inhibition at 100 nm  xxxd3226xxx  (309 × 103, 95% ci = 285 × 103
to 332 × 103, versus 541 × 103, 95% ci = 487 × 103 to 584 × 103;
p<.001).
examination of the tt and tpc1 cell cycle profiles by flow
cytometry showed a marked g1 arrest of both cell lines upon
treatment with 1 mum  xxxd3226xxx  (fig. 4, d). there were approximately 10-fold more tpc1 cells in the sub-g1 fraction after
 xxxd3226xxx  treatment compared with vehicle treatment.
in addition to its cytostatic effect,  xxxd3226xxx  exerts a proapoptotic effect at this drug concentration. thus,  xxxd3226xxx 
blocks oncogenic ret signaling in tt and tpc1 cells and has a
mainly cytostatic effect.

kinase/ret inhibitors pp1,  xxxd1307xxx , and zd6474 (16). we measured
the effect of  xxxd3226xxx  on the activity of ret/v804l and
ret/v804m kinases using the in vitro poly-gt kinase assay.
despite their resistance to other inhibitors, both mutants were
only two- to threefold less sensitive than ret/c634r to inhibition by  xxxd3226xxx . the ic50 of  xxxd3226xxx  was 110 nm for
ret/v804l (95% ci = 88 nm to 133 nm) and 147 nm for ret/
v804m (95% ci = 123 nm to 170 nm), whereas the ic50 of bay
43-9006 for ret/c634r was 49 nm (95% ci = 35 nm to 62 nm)
(fig. 5, b).
we sought to verify these findings in intact cells. rat1 fibroblasts expressing the ret/v804l or the ret/v804m alleles were
treated for 2 hours with vehicle,  xxxd3226xxx , or pp1 (500 or
1000 nm), and ret phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting. similar to the in vitro data, only residual phosphorylation
of the two mutant proteins (more pronounced for v804m) was
detected after treatment with 500 nm  xxxd3226xxx  (fig. 5, c).
mutant ret phosphorylation was virtually abrogated by 1000 nm
 xxxd3226xxx  (fig. 5, c). as previously reported (16), pp1 only
slightly inhibited ret phosphorylation at these doses (fig. 5, c).
we studied the effects exerted by  xxxd3226xxx  on the growth
rate of rat1 cells transformed by ret/v804m and ret/c634r
(fig. 5, d). fewer ret/c634r cells remained after 9 days of
treatment with 0.1 mum  xxxd3226xxx  than with vehicle (46 × 104,

of mice treated with vehicle increased (from 87 to 408 mm3, difference = 320 mm3, 95% ci = 180 mm3 to 460 mm3; p<.001)
(fig. 6, a). analysis of variance (linear mixed-effect model) test
for repeated measures and the wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrated that differences between treated and untreated animal
were statistically significant (p<.001 and p = .02, respectively).
treated tumors showed a cytoreduction, probably because of the
extensive necrosis occurring upon treatment (fig. 6, b). ki67/
mib-1 immunostaining was reduced in treated tumors, which is
consistent with a reduced mitotic index (not shown). more
important, we observed a strong reduction of in vivo ret phosphorylation in proteins that were extracted from tumors in bay
43-9006-treated versus vehicle-treated mice (fig. 6, c).

inhibition of tt-induced tumor growth in nude mice
by  xxxd3226xxx 
to investigate the effects of  xxxd3226xxx  on medullary thyroid carcinoma tumor growth, we injected nude mice (subcutaneous, right dorsal) with 1 × 107 tt cells. after approximately
30 days, when tumors measured approximately 80 mm3, mice
(seven in each group) were randomized to receive  xxxd3226xxx 
(60 mg/kg/day) or vehicle 5 days/week for 3 weeks. treatment
with  xxxd3226xxx  strongly reduced tumor growth (fig. 6).
after 21 days, the mean volume of tumors in mice treated with
 xxxd3226xxx  decreased (from 72.5 to 44 mm3, difference =
28.5 mm3, 95% ci = 7 mm3 to 50 mm3; p = .018), whereas that

discussion
here, we have shown that  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits ret
enzymatic function. it inhibited ret signaling and growth of
ret-transfected fibroblasts and human thyroid cancer cells that
harbor ret/ptc and ret/men 2 oncogenes. furthermore,
 xxxd3226xxx  blocked growth of xenograft tumors that were
derived from a mtc cell line.

 xxxd3226xxx  is a biaryl urea that targets the raf family
serine/threonine kinases  xxxg1924xxx  and braf (29,30) and the tyrosine
kinase receptors  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ),  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ),  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , and kit (30).  xxxd3226xxx  probably inhibits the growth
of ret-driven tumors through a combination of these activities
and targets both vegf-dependent tumor angiogenesis and retdependent thyroid cancer cell proliferation. intriguingly, the
anilinoquinazoline zd6474 also exerts both anti-ret (14) and
anti- xxxg800xxx  activities (38).
molecular resistance is the major obstacle to targeted cancer
therapy with small-molecule kinase inhibitors (24). for example,
relapses after an initial response are frequent in chronic myelogenous leukemia due to the emergence of cells that are resistant to
imatinib (39,40). this resistance is primarily mediated by mutations that either 1) allosterically prevent the abl kinase from
adopting the inactive conformation to which imatinib binds or
2) directly target the imatinib binding site. an example of the second type of mutation is the threonine-to-isoleucine substitution
at position 315 in abl (t315i) (39–42). consequently, threonine
315 in abl and the homologous residues in other receptor
tyrosine kinases (threonine 790 in egfr, threonine 674 in  xxxg1709xxx , and threonine 670 in kit) have been designated “gatekeepers,” because their mutation causes resistance to various
small-molecule inhibitors (25–28). the homologous residue in
ret is v804, which is a determinant of susceptibility to pyrazolopyrimidines and anilinoquinazolines (16). here we show that
v804l and v804m only slightly (a two- and threefold increase in
ic50, respectively) affect ret susceptibility to  xxxd3226xxx .
these findings also raise the possibility that  xxxd3226xxx  might
be of benefit in patients who harbor ret mutations at v804 [rare
men 2 families and some sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma
patients (4–5,17–23)], who thus might have a “primary” resistance

to other inhibitors. structural analysis of  xxxd3226xxx  binding
to the ret kinase would give insight as how to design inhibitors
that can overcome drug resistance toward gate-keeper mutants.
the study has several potential limitations. given the lack of
a v804 mutation-positive mtc cell line, we could not verify
the in vivo activity of  xxxd3226xxx  on this oncogenic form
of ret. also we cannot exclude the possibility that ret mutants,
other than those tested in this study, may have resistance to
the compound.
in conclusion, we have shown that  xxxd3226xxx  targets
ret-derived oncoproteins and blocks the growth of mtc xenografts. moreover we have shown the efficacy of the compound
on v804-resistant mutants. the preclinical findings reported
here suggest that  xxxd3226xxx  might offer a potential treatment
strategy for papillary and medullary thyroid carcinomas sustaining oncogenic activation of ret. nevertheless, only by testing
the activity of the compound in thyroid cancer patients will
it be possible to assess the clinical value of ret inhibition by
 xxxd3226xxx .
