problem: endometriosis is associated with a chronic inflammatory process, and the
increased number of activated peritoneal macrophages is one of the major hallmarks
of this process. the medical treatment of the disease, which is based on the creation
of an hypoestrogenic milieu unfavorable to the growth of endometriotic lesions, is
often associated with a reduced peritoneal inflammation. the aim of this study was to
investigate the ability of current therapeutic agents to modulate, through a direct
mechanism, the expression by endometriotic cells of monocyte chemotactic protein-1
( xxxg357xxx ), a chemokine endowed with the potent faculty of recruiting and activating
macrophages.
method of study: cells were stimulated with  xxxg1170xxx  (il-1b) to
induce  xxxg357xxx  expression.  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion and mrna steady-state levels
were evaluated by elisa and northern blot, respectively.
results: our results show that  xxxd1806xxx  concentrations (10 − 7 –10 − 5 m), taking into
account the therapeutic levels found in the plasma of treated patients, inhibited  xxxg357xxx 
protein and mrna steady-state levels in endometriotic cells, whereas  xxxd388xxx 
(0.1–10 ng/ml), a gnrh agonist, had no significant effect. dexamethasone, an
anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, used at concentrations varying between 10 − 12 and
10 − 6 m, also displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory action.
conclusions: these results put into prominence the capability of  xxxd1806xxx  to
directly inhibit the expression of a potent  xxxg357xxx 
by ectopic endometrial cells shedding more light on the mechanisms underlying the
clinical effects of hormonal therapeutic agents used in the treatment of endometriosis.

introduction
endometriosis, the proliferation of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus,
is a common gynecological disease causing pelvic pain and infertility in about
10% of the female population.1 endometriosis is associated with an immunoinflammatory process observed locally in the peritoneal cavity, where

 xxxg357xxx  regulation by therapeutic agents
endometriotic lesions are commonly found.2,3 in
women with endometriosis, peritoneal macrophages
are more numerous 4 and at a higher level of activation.5 – 7 macrophages are believed to contribute in
many ways to the initiation, the development and the
growth of endometriosis by secreting angiogenic8 and
growth factors.9,10 they might also be involved in
endometriosis-associated infertility, directly through
sperm phagocytosis,5 and indirectly by secreting
proinflammatory cytokines11,12 and embryotoxic products.13 we have previously reported that ectopic endometrial cells have the ability to secrete  xxxg357xxx 
following exposure to the proinflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1beta (il-1b) and tumor necrosis factoralpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) in 6itro.14  xxxg357xxx  is an important
determinant of macrophage infiltration into tumors
and tissues, and this recruitment is believed to be
mediated primarily via chemotaxis.15,16 subsequently,
we found that estradiol enhances endometriotic cells
responsiveness to il-1 and upregulates  xxxg357xxx  expression.17 because estradiol is believed to be a hormonal
factor that plays a key role in the maintenance of
endometriosis,18,19 the hormonal therapy of the disease is actually based on the suppression of ovarian
function.20,21  xxxd1806xxx , a synthetic steroid with multiple and diverse biologic effects, centrally inhibits
gonadotropins, suppressing gametogenesis and
steroidogenesis. however,  xxxd1806xxx  also displays immunoregulatory effects, both in 6i6o and in 6itro,
possesses progestin-like properties, and can directly
interact with eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues.22 – 24  xxxg930xxx  agonists
(gnrha) are rather known to act by inhibiting gonadotropin release and therefore steroidogenesis.21,25
the objective of the present study was to determine
the effect of these treatments on  xxxg357xxx  expression by
ectopic endometrial cells.

materials and methods
source and handling of tissue
endometriotic biopsies used in this study were obtained from seven women with endometriosis (table
i). these women signed an informed consent for a
research protocol approved by the saint-françois
d’assise hospital ethics committee on human research. they were aged between 29 and 39 years,
consulted for infertility and/or pelvic pain, had no
endometrial hyperplasia or neoplasia, and had not
received any anti-inflammatory or hormonal medication during a period of at least 3 months before
laparoscopy. endometriosis was staged at laparoscopy
according to the revised american fertility society
classification.26 endometriotic biopsies were immediately placed at 4°c in sterile hank’s balanced salt
solution (hbss) containing 100 u/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml streptamycin, and 0.25 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx 
(gibco brl, burlington, ontario, canada) and
transported to the laboratory.

tissue dissociation and cell culture
endometriotic tissue was minced into small pieces,
incubated with collagenase (sigma chemical co., st
louis, mo) to dissociate epithelial glands from
fibroblast-like cells.27 cells were pelleted by centrifugation (200× g for 10 min), resuspended in dmemf12 containing 10 mg/ml insulin, 5 mg/ml transferrin
and 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), and plated in 100
mm diameter culture dishes then grown at 37°c, in
5% carbon dioxide. in this study, no attempt was
made to separate epithelial cells from stromal fibroblast-like cells. these were identified morphologically in
culture by light microscopy and immunocytochemically with specific monoclonal antibodies to cytoker-

atins and vimentin as previously described.27 no
leukocytes were detected in the endometriotic cells
detached from culture dishes and assessed by flow
cytometry (data not shown).

culture stimulation and  xxxg357xxx  synthesis
endometriotic cells grown to confluence were seeded
at 20,000 cells/cm2 in 25 cm2 culture flasks in rpmi
medium (gibco brl, burlington, ontario, canada)
containing 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fbs
(fbs-dc), 10 mg/ml insulin, 5 mg/ml transferrin and
1% antibiotics-antimycotics. for stimulation with  xxxg1170xxx , cells grown to confluence were incubated
overnight with fbs-free medium before being exposed
to different concentrations of il-1b (0.01 – 10 ng/ml)
(genzyme, cambridge, ma) in a fresh fbs-free
medium for varying periods of time (0 – 24 h). for
treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  (sigma chemical co., st
louis, mo) used  xxxd1891xxx  − 7 – 10 − 5 m22 or  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonists
( xxxd387xxx  acetate, suprefact, hoechst, montreal,
quebec, canada) used at 0.110 ng/ml,28 the culture
medium was removed 2 days following cell passage
and replaced with a fresh medium containing different
concentrations of hormones. media were changed every 2 days and, at confluence, cells were washed with
serum-free rpmi and incubation with hormones pursued in rpmi medium enriched with 1% its + (insulin-transferrin-selenium-linoleic acid) (bectondickinson inc., mississauga, ontario, canada) for a
further 3-day period. cells were then rinsed and exposed or not exposed to il-1b in a fresh medium at a
final concentration of 0.1 ng/ml. six hours later, the
culture supernatant was collected and kept in small
aliquots at − 20°c until use for  xxxg357xxx  assay by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) as previously reported,29 whereas cells were dissociated with
trypsin/edta and kept at −80°c until use for
northern blot analysis. for treatment with dexamethasone (dxs) (sigma chemical co., st louis, mo),
cells grown to confluence were incubated overnight
with serum-free rpmi, then with dxs (10 − 12 –10 − 6
m) 30 for 18 hr in the same medium prior to exposure
to 0.1 ng/ml il-1b for an additional 6 hr. cells and
culture supernatants were then recovered as mentioned earlier.

northern blot analysis
total rna was extracted from cells with trizol
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(gibco brl, burlington, ontario, canada). rna
was size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 1%
agarose gels containing 10% formaldehyde and transferred to a hybond-n + membrane (amersham,
© munksgaard, copenhagen

oakville, ontario, canada). the membrane was then
dehydrated at 37°c for 30 min, prehybridized with a
hybridization buffer comprised of 5× ssc, 5×denhardt’s solution, 50 mm nah2po4, 0.5% sds, 200
mg/ml salmon sperm dna and 50% formamide, hybridized with 32p-labeled  xxxg357xxx  cdna (atcc,
rockville, maryland, usa) in the hybridization
buffer and washed with 1× ssc, 0.2× ssc and 0.1%
sds, respectively, before being exposed to x-ray film
(biomax, eastman kodak, rochester, ny, usa) at
− 80°c for about 18 hr. staining with ethidium bromide (gibco brl, burlington, ontario, canada)
and hybridization with 28s cdna probe (atcc)
were performed to ensure equal loading of rna.
data were analyzed as ratios of the density of the
hybridization signals of  xxxg357xxx  to 28s, as determined
by computer-assisted densitometry (bioimage, visage
110s, genomic solutions inc., annharbour, mi).

statistical analysis
all experiments were repeated at least three times.
data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (anova), and the tukey test was used post-hoc
for multiple comparisons. differences were considered
as statistically significant for pb 0.05.

results
in 6itro, spontaneous secretion of  xxxg357xxx  by endometriotic cells was weak. without any stimulation,
cultured cells did not express detectable amount of
 xxxg357xxx  mrna by northern blot analysis (data not
shown). in order to determine the effect of therapeutic
agents such as  xxxd1806xxx  and gnrha on  xxxg357xxx  expression, we used interleukin-1b (il-1b) as stimulus to
induce the synthesis of  xxxg357xxx  by endometriotic cells.
il-1 is one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines
found in elevated concentrations in the peritoneal
fluid of patients with endometriosis.31,32 il-1 is mainly
secreted by activated macrophages that have been
shown to be actively recruited into the peritoneal
cavity of patients and to infiltrate endometriotic lesions.4,5,33,34 endometriotic cells were first exposed to
different concentrations of il-1b for various periods
of time in order to determine optimal stimulation
conditions. as shown in fig. 1,  xxxg357xxx  mrna and
protein expression were detectable following stimulation with 0.01 ng/ml il-1b during 6 hr and maximal
stimulation was observed at 1 ng/ml.  xxxg357xxx  protein
secretion was detected after 2 hr of stimulation with
0.1 ng/ml of il-1b and increased progressively during
the 24 hr of treatment, whereas  xxxg357xxx  mrna
steady-state levels reached maximal levels after 6 hr of
stimulation and decreased after 24 hr of treatment

were obtained from patients c2 and c3.)

tion of 0.1 ng/ml il-1b were therefore used in the
subsequent experiments to detect any possible effect of
the hormonal agents.
endometriotic cells were continuously exposed to
 xxxd1806xxx  (10 − 7 –10 − 5 m) or to  xxxd387xxx  acetate
(0.1 –10 ng/ml) before being treated at confluence
with il-1b (0.1 ng/ml). the results illustrated in fig.
2a (% of control, mean9 sem from three independent cell cultures) show that  xxxd1806xxx  inhibited il-1binduced  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion by endometriotic
cells in a dose-dependent manner. this was also observed by northern blot analysis of  xxxg357xxx  mrna
steady-state levels in endometriotic cells, which declined as  xxxd1806xxx  concentrations increased in the culture medium (fig. 2b). in contrast,  xxxd387xxx  acetate
had no detectable effect on  xxxg357xxx  protein and
mrna steady-state levels by endometriotic cells as
compared to vehicle (benzalkonium chloride) used at
concentrations (0.01 – 1 ng/ml) equivalent to those
present in the different  xxxd387xxx  acetate dilutions
(0.1 –10 ng/ml) (fig. 3). the il-1b-induced  xxxg357xxx 
protein secretion and mrna steady-state levels were
also reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by dexamethasone (10 − 12 – 10 − 6 m), an anti-inflammatory
agent which is known to inhibit  xxxg357xxx  expression in
a variety of cells (fig. 4).

the hormonal treatment of endometriosis is based on
the suppression of ovarian function and the induction
of hypoestrogenism.20,21,25 such a treatment, while
resulting only in temporary involution of the disease,
has been shown to reduce endometriotic lesion volume
21,25,35
and the immuno-inflammatory process observed in the peritoneal cavity.3 however, it is not yet
clearly known by what mechanisms the inflammation
associated to endometriosis is reduced by therapeutic
agents.
our study shows that  xxxd1806xxx  significantly inhibits
 xxxg357xxx  protein secretion and reduces  xxxg357xxx  mrna
steady-state levels in il-1-stimulated endometriotic
cells.  xxxd1806xxx  concentrations used in the present
study take into account the therapeutic levels found in
the plasma of treated patients.23 this suggests that
 xxxd1806xxx  can exert a direct action on endometriotic
cells and may contribute, in a direct way, to decrease
the related inflammatory process by downregulating
 xxxg357xxx  expression by these cells.

cells. cells were treated with different concentrations of  xxxd1806xxx

or without 0.1 ng/ml il-1b for 6 hr. (a)  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion
in the culture medium was determined by elisa and expressed as

is consistent with these in 6itro and in 6i6o findings,
suggests that such a newly identified property may
account in the overall inhibitory or immunomodulatory action of this agent.
the mechanism(s) underlying the direct inhibitory
action of  xxxd1806xxx  on  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometriotic cells remain to be clearly elucidated.  xxxd1806xxx  has
been shown to interact with progesterone, androgen,
and glucocorticoid receptors on endometrial cells22,38
and to exert a direct inhibitory action on their
growth.28 the presence of progesterone receptors in
ectopic endometrial cells has previously been reported.39,40 however, our previous studies did not
show any detectable direct effect of progesterone on
 xxxg357xxx  expression by endometriotic cells.17 expression of  xxxg183xxx  mrna has also been reported in ovarian endometriosis,41 but the expression
of the functional receptor has not been yet documented. in the present study, endometriotic cells were
responsive to dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, which causes the expression of glucocorticoid

protein secretion in the culture medium was determined by elisa
and expressed as percentage of control (conditioned medium from
cultures having not been submitted to any hormonal treatment but

ribosomal rna demonstrated equal rna loading.

besides its well-known effect to induce a hypoestrogenic state,  xxxd1806xxx  has been shown to possess numerous immunomodulatory effects.23 in several
autoimmune diseases,  xxxd1806xxx  appeared to modulate
the ratio of t-helper/t-suppressor lymphocytes and to
inhibit b-cell proliferation and autoantibody production. treatment of endometriosis patients with  xxxd1806xxx  has been shown to inhibit peripheral blood
monocytes and peritoneal macrophage activation, and
to downregulate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced by these cells36 and found to be elevated
in the peritoneal fluid of patients.31,32,37 in 6itro,  xxxd1806xxx  has been shown to suppress macrophage-dependent t-cell proliferation and activation of b cells.22

fig. 4. effect of dexamethasone on  xxxg357xxx  expression by endometriotic epithelial cells. cells grown to confluence were incubated with different concentrations of dexamethasone (dxs)
(10 − 12 – 10 − 6 m) for 18 hr, then with 0.1 ng/ml il-1b for a further
6 hr. conditioned media and cells were then recovered for elisa
and northern analyses of  xxxg357xxx  protein and mrna expression
respectively. (a)  xxxg357xxx  protein secretion was expressed as a percentage of control (cultures stimulated with 0.1 ng/ml il-1b without any previous incubation with dexamethasone). values are
means 9sem of duplicate determinations in two different patients
( c6, c 7). (*) significantly different from control (pb 0.05); (b) a

levels and 28s ribosomal rna demonstrating equal rna loading
(patient c 6).

 xxxg357xxx  regulation by therapeutic agents
receptors by these cells and a glucocorticoid receptormediated action. according to recent studies,  xxxg1601xxx  inhibits the activity of nuclear
factor-kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ), one of the main transcriptional factors that mediate  xxxg357xxx  gene activation by
il-1, by physical interaction and by inducing inhibitory-kappa b (i-kb), and can directly interact with
cis-active elements in the promoter region of  xxxg357xxx 
gene.42,43
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression by ectopic endometrial cells was markedly inhibited by
dexamethasone and in a dose-dependent manner. this
is consistent with the anti-inflammatory properties of
dexamethasone and its capability to inhibit  xxxg357xxx 
expression by a variety of cell types.30,44,45 on the
other hand, this may have a potential clinical interest,
considering the widely reported inflammatory process
frequently associated with endometriosis.2,3,46 few
clinical studies addressing the usefulness of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of endometriosis are
available. simon et al.47 have shown that glucocorticoid treatment decreases sera embryotoxicity in this
disease. this could be of benefit for patients undergoing ivf to promote early embryonic development.
in the present study,  xxxd387xxx  acetate, a gnrh
agonist, did not show any direct effect on  xxxg357xxx 
expression by endometriotic cells. the presence of
gnrh receptors on endometriotic cells has been reported.48 however, there are no available data indicating that these receptors are functional. many in 6i6o
and in 6itro studies have shown immunomodulatory
effects for gnrh agonists.49,50 gnrh agonists are
known to act via their ability to suppress the production of ovarian steroid hormones and could downregulate  xxxg357xxx  expression by rather an indirect
mechanism. in fact, our previous investigations have
shown that estradiol enhanced ectopic endometrial
cell responsiveness to the proinflammatory cytokine
il-1 and increased  xxxg357xxx  expression by these cells.17
in summary, our results revealed the capability of
 xxxd1806xxx  to directly inhibit the expression of  xxxg357xxx , a
potent  xxxg357xxx ,
by endometriotic cells, and showed that gnrha had
no significant direct effect. these findings shed more
light on the mechanisms underlying the clinical effects
of hormonal therapeutic agents used in the treatment
of endometriosis, and may be of considerable relevance in the physiopathology of the disease in view of
 xxxg357xxx  biological properties.  xxxg357xxx  can be involved
in macrophage recruitment and activation, which have
been reported to release a wide variety of growth and
angiogenic factors that may promote ectopic growth
of endometrial cells and contribute to endometriosisassociated biological changes and clinical symptoms.
