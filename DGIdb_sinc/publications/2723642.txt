abstract: the present study demonstrates for the first time
the solubilization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding
sites (pbs) from cat cerebral cortex. of all detergents tested
{ digitonin, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammon~o]1propane sulfonate (chaps), tween 20,  xxxd1835xxx , and
triton x-loo} in the presence of  xxxg2020xxx , the best solubilization
(1 5% of initial activity) was obtained using 0.5%of the zwitterionic detergent chaps plus 2 m naci. specific binding
of [3h]pk 1 1 195 to membrane-bound and solubilized pbs
was saturable, yielding equilibrium dissociation constants
(kd)of 1.3 k 0.2 and 1.9 k 0.3 nm, respectively, and maximal
numbers of binding sites of 1,435 k 150 and 980 k 126 tmol/
mg protein, respectively. the kdvalue of pk i 1 195 binding
to solubilized pbs obtained from experimental kinetic analysis was 0.95 2 0.09 nm. the relative potencies of various
compounds (pk 11 195, ro 5-4864, diazepam, flunitrazepam,

clonazepam, methyl-/3-carboline-3-carboxylate, and ro i 51788) in displacing [3h]pk 1 1 195 specific binding from
membrane-bound and solubilized pbs were similar. most of
the solubilized binding activity was destroyed by heating at
60°c for 30 min or by treatment with 2 m guanidinium
chloride, which indicates the presence of a protein-binding
site in the solubilized preparation. over 85%of the solubilized
binding activity was retained after 1 week at 4 t , which will
enable future application of purification procedures without
major concern for stability of the material. key words: solubilization-peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-l-propane sulfonate-cat-cerebral

specific benzodiazepine (bz) receptors were first
characterized in the mammalian cns (braestrup and
squires, 1977; mohler and okada, 1977). the binding
of various bzs to these receptors correlates with their
clinical potency as anticonvulsants and anxiolytics
(mohler et al., 1978).
in addition to the central-type bz receptors rnentioned above, another type of bz binding site has been
located in peripheral tissues and also in the brain
(braestrup and squires, 1977; marangos et al., 1982;
taniguchi et al., 1982; fares et al., 1987). these sites,
termed "peripheral-type bz binding sites" (pbs), differ
from the central type in their subcellular localization,
their distribution within the brain, their lack of coupling
to y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) receptors, and their
specificity for ligand binding. clonazepam, which binds

with high affinity to the central type, exhibits very low
affinity for pbs, whereas the reverse is true with regard
to ro 5-4864 and pi( 1 1 195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative.
the precise physiologic and pharmacologk functions
of pbs are as yet unclear. several lines of evidence
indicate that pbs are subject to hormonal modulation
(anholt et al., 1985; gavish et al., 1986, 1987; fares
et al., 1987). recently porphyrins have been characterized as possible pbs endogenous ligands (verma et
al., 1987).
in the present study we demonstrate for the first time
the solubilization of pbs from cat cerebral cortex, using
a combination of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammoniol- 1-propane sulfonate (chaps) plus  xxxg2020xxx .
these results constitute an important step in the pu-

['hipk 11 195 (79.6 ci/mmol) was purchasled from new
england nuclear (boston, ma, u.s.a.). unlabeled bzs were
supplied kindly by drs. h. gutman and e. kyburz, hoffmann-la roche (basel, switzerland). unlabeled pk 11 195
was a generous gift from dr. g. le fur, pharniuka laboratories (gennevilliers, france). digitonin,  xxxd1835xxx

chemical (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.). chaps was purchased
from calbiochem (la jolla, ca, u.s.a.). lumax was obtained
from lumac (schaesberg, the netherlands). all other chemicals were purchased from commercial sources.

membrane preparation
male and female common european house cats (3-3.5 kg
body weight) were killed by overdose of phenobarbital. the
cerebral cortex was removed immediately and frozen at
-70°c until use. thawed cerebral cortex was homogenized
in 50 volumes of 50 mm tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, at 4°c
with a brinkmann polytron (setting 10) for 151 s and centrifuged at 49,000 g for 30 min. the pellet was homogenized
in the same buffer to a final concentration of 5 mg tissue
weight/ml and used for membrane binding studies.

data analysis

the washed membrane pellets were homogeinized (175 mg
tissue weight/ml) in 50 mm tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, containing various concentrations of detergents and naci. the
homogenate was stirred for 30 min at 4°c then diluted 1: 1
with 50 m m tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, to a concentration
(0.25%) that was found to reduce [3h]pk 1 1 105 binding activity by only 10% (see table 1). the homogenate then was
centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min, and the supernatant was
used as the solubilized binding site preparation.

equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and maximal
number of binding sites (bmj were determined by scatchard
analysis. results are expressed as the means of three separate
experiments with < 15% variability.

binding assay
binding activity of pbs was assayed in 50 mm tris-hci
buffer, ph 7.4, in a final volume of 500 pl that contained
400 pl of membrane-bound or solubilized pbs (200-600 wg

incubation, [3h]pk 1 1 195 (2 nm) specific binding was measured as
described in materials and methods. results are the means of three
separate experiments with <15% variability.

results
effect of chaps on pbs binding activity
the effects of various concentrations of chaps on
the specific binding of [3h]pk 1 i195 (2 nm)to cat
cerebral cortical membranes are presented in table 1.
at a concentration of 0.5% chaps, -45% of [3h]pk
1 1 195-specificbinding was inhibited, and at 1% most
of the binding activity was destroyed.
solubilization of pbs from cat cerebral cortex by
various detergents
the capability of various detergents at a concentration of o s % , in the presence and in the absence of 2
m  xxxg2020xxx , to solubilize pbs from cat cerebral cortex is
presented in table 2. the zwitterionic detergent
chaps (in the presence of 2 m  xxxg2020xxx ) was found to
be the most suitable detergent for the solubilization of
pbs from cat cerebral cortex. at a concentration of
0.5% chaps in the presence of 2 m nacl, -25% of
the initial protein and 15%of initial membrane [3h]pk
1 1 195 binding activity were solubilized. similar results
were obtained when dilution was performed either before or after ultracentrifugation (data not shown). solubilization by doc and digitonin in the presence of 2
m nacl was only 15 and 3%, respectively, of that obtained with 0.5% chaps plus 2 mnacl. solubilization

by chaps, doc, and digitonin in the absence of nacl
was 32, 6, and 2%, respectively, of that obtained with
0.5% chaps plus 2 mnacl. no [3h]pk 1 1 195 binding activity was observed when solubilization wa.j* conducted with 0.5% tween 20 or triton x-100 in either
the presence or the absence of nacl. it should be noted
that when used at concentrations <0.5%, most detergents either did not solubilize any pbs activity or
yielded very low activity (data not shown).
the effects of various concentrations of chaps, in
the presence of 2 mnac1, on the solubilization of pbs
from cat cerebral cortex are presented in fig. 1a. maximal binding activity of [3h]pk 11 195 in the soluble
extract was obtained at a concentration of 0.5%
chaps. at chaps concentrations lower or higher
than 0.5%, less binding activity of [3h]pk 11 195 was
obtained in the solubilized materials.
the effects of various concentrations of nacl, in the
presence of 0.5% chaps, on the solubilization of pbs
from cat cerebral cortex are presented in fig. 1b. at a
concentration of 1.5-2 m  xxxg2020xxx , maximal binding activity of [3h]pk 1 1 195 in the soluble extract was obtained. in the absence of nacl, only 32% of the [3h]pk
11 195 binding activity achieved in the presence of 2
m nacl was obtained in the solubilized materials.

[3h]pk 11195 binding characteristics in membranebound and solubilized pbs from cat cerebral cortex
[3h]pk 1 1 195 specific binding to membrane-bound
and solubilized pbs was saturable and reached a plateau at 8- 10 nm (fig. 2). scatchard analysis indicated
that [3h]pk 11 195 bound to a single population of
membrane-bound and solubilized pbs, yielding b,,,
values of 1,435 2 150 and 980 -t 126 fmol/mg protein,
respectively, and kdvalues of 1.3 2 0.2 and 1.9 k 0.3
nm,respectively.
the time course of [3h]pk 1 1 195 association to solubilized pbs is presented in fig. 3. at 4°c the specific
binding of [3h]pk 11 195 to solubilized pbs reached
equilibrium after 15 min of incubation. the observed
constant value for [3h]pk 11 195 specific binding to
solubilized pbs was 0.153 f 0.02 min-'. the association constant value for solubilized pbs obtained from
these experiments was 0.05 17 k 0.007 1 min-' nm-'.
the time course of t3h]pk 11195 dissociation from
solubilized pbs also is presented in fig. 3.one-half of
the amount of specific t3h]pk 1 1 195/solubilized pbs
complexes was dissociated after 14 min. the dissociation constant rate for solubilized pbs obtained from
these kinetic experiments was 0.0495 k 0.0068 min-',
and the kd value was 0.95 f 0.09 nm.
potency of various compounds in displacing bound
['hipk 11195 from membrane-bound and solubilized
pbs from cat cerebral cortex
the potency of various compounds in inhibiting
[3h]pk 1 1195 specific binding to membrane-bound
and solubilized pbs from cat cerebral cortex is presented in table 3. pk 11 195 was the most potent in
displacing bound [3h]pk 11 195 in both solubilized
and membrane-bound pbs from cat cerebral cortex.
ro 5-4864 was two orders of magnitude less potent
than pk 11 195. the difference in potency between
unlabeled pk 11 195 and ro 5-4864 in inhibiting
[3h]pk 11 195 specific binding to membrane-bound
pbs in cat cerebral cortex was in agreement with our
previous findings (awad and gavish, 1987). diazepam
and flunitrazepam were three orders of magnitude less
potent than pk 1 1195 in both membrane-bound and
soluble states. clonazepam, methyl-p-carboline-3carboxylate, and ro 15-1788 were ineffective (icso
> 10,000 nm)in displacing [3h]pk 1 1 195 from either
preparation.

pbs, on the other hand, are more sensitive to detergent
treatment and usually undergo denaturation at lower
detergent concentrations than those commonly used
for receptor solubilization (gavish and fares, 1985;
anholt et al., 1986;awad and gavish, 1988). digitonin
has been found to be most suitable for pbs solubilization from rat kidney and adrenal gland (benavides
et al., 1985; gavish and fares, 1985). triton x-100
was found to be suitable for pbs solubilization from
rat kidney only after the detergent concentration was

of the solubilized material with 1 or 2 m guanidinium
chloride resulted in losses of 50 and 8o?h, respectively,
of the binding activity.
discussion
membrane proteins vary in their response to detergent treatments, depending on their ionic and nonionic
properties. some membrane proteins retain biological
activity following treatment with a wide range of detergents, whereas others lose activity with detergents.
central-type bz receptors have been solubilized
successfully by various detergents, including doc

pbs from membrane-bound and solubilized cat cerebral cortex
were incubated with 1 nm i3h]pk i 1 195 for 60 min at 4°c in the
presence of various concentrations ( 10-'0-10-5 m ) of inhibitors. each

lowered by bio-beads (martini et al., 1983). sodium
 xxxd1685xxx  also was found appropriate for pbs solubilization from rat kidney, but only after addition o f soybean lipids (anholt et al., 1986).
although pbs are known to be distributed widely
in mammalian brain, their solubilization and purification from the brain have not as yet been reported.
solubilization of "active" binding sites will provide the
basis for further purification and characterization of
pbs. the specific binding of [3h]pk 1 1 195 to rat., rabbit, guinea pig, dog, calf, and cat cerebral cortex. was
measured in a recent study (awad and gavish, 1'387).
it was found that cat cerebral cortex exhibited the
highest specific [3h]pk 11 195 binding capacity. this
observation was in agreement with the finding of benavides et al. (1 984). we therefore used cat cerebral
cortex for the solubilization studies reported here:.
in the present study we found that the best solubilization of pbs from cat cerebral cortex was achieved
by 0.5% chaps plus 2 mnacl and that pbs binding
characteristics extant in the membrane-bound state
were retained after solubilization. at a concentration
of 0.5% chaps plus 2 m  xxxg2020xxx , 25% of the initial
protein and 15% of initial membrane [3h]pk 18.195
binding was solubilized and 45% of the binding activity
was destroyed by the detergent.
solubility of pbs in these experimental conditions
was demonstrated by the fact that most of the binding
activity was retained in the supernatant after further
centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h and also by the fact
that binding activity was obtained only when cf/b
filters were pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimiine.
further support is found in the fact that pbs were: adsorbed on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose ion-exchange
column and most of the binding activity was eluted by
nacl in a single peak (data not shown). it should be
noted that gf/b filters pretreated with 0.370polyethyleneimine restored the same binding activity of
[3h]pk 11 195 as did filtration, after precipitation by
the  xxxd2982xxx  method (data not shown).
j a'eurochem , vol 52. no 6, 1989

our results differ in two ways from previously published data concerning pbs solubilization from rat adrenal gland and kidney: ( i ) digitonin, which successfully solubilized pbs from rat adrenal gland and kidney, failed to solubilize pbs from cat cerebral cortex,
in both the presence and the absence of nacl; (2) decreasing the chaps concentration by dialysis or solubilization in the presence of supplementary soybean
lipids did not increase the percentage of recovery of
binding activity. the nature of these differences is as
yet unclear.
the fact that both central and peripheral-type solubilized bz receptors are active in the same preparation
opens the way to investigation of both types of receptors
on the molecular level. it also encourages conducting
experiments designed to separate physically central and
peripheral bz binding sites. these studies should be
of great interest, because the existence of atypical submicromolar-affinity pbs coupled to the gaba/bzreceptor-chloride ionophore complex recently has been
reported (gee et al., 1988).
in addition, the fact that heating or treatment with
guanidinium chloride inactivated most of the binding
activity indicates the presence of a protein binding site
in the solubilized preparation. finally, the fact that
>85% of pbs activity was retained after 1 week at 4°c
will enable application of purification procedures
without major concern for stability of the material.
