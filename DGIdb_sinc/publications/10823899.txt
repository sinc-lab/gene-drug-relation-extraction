the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) is a target of amphetamine (amph)
and cocaine. these psychostimulants attenuate dat clearance efficiency, thereby increasing synaptic dopamine (da) levels. re-uptake
rate is determined by the number of functional transporters at the cell
surface as well as by their turnover rate. here, we present evidence
that dat substrates, including amph and da, cause internalization of
human dat, thereby reducing transport capacity. acute treatment
with amph reduced the maximal rate of [3h]da uptake, decreased
amph-induced currents, and significantly redistributed the immunofluorescence of an epitope-tagged dat from the plasma membrane
to the cytosol in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. conversely, dat
inhibitors, such as cocaine,  xxxd2546xxx , and  xxxd2746xxx , when administered with amph, blocked the reduction in [3h]da uptake and the
redistribution of dat immunofluorescence to the cytosol. the reductions of [3h]da uptake and amph-induced dat internalization also
were inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of
dynamin i (k44a), indicating that endocytosis modulates transport
capacity, likely through a clathrin-mediated pathway. with this mechanism of regulation, acute application of amph would reduce da
uptake not only by direct competition for uptake, but also by reducing
the available cell-surface dat. moreover, amph-induced internalization might diminish the amount of dat available for da efflux,
thereby modulating the cytotoxic effects of elevated extracellular da.

d

opamine (da) signaling in the central nervous system mediates a wide variety of physiologic functions such as movement,
motivational control of voluntary behavior, and lactation (1, 2). the
magnitude and duration of da signaling is defined by the amount
of vesicular release, the sensitivity of the da receptors, and the
efficiency of da clearance. the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) is largely
responsible for regulating da clearance (3).
psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine (amph),
induce da overflow into the synaptic cleft by acting on the dat,
thereby enhancing dopaminergic transmission (4). cocaine acts by
inhibiting the re-uptake of released da (5, 6). amph-like drugs,
however, are thought to promote the release of the transmitter
(carrier-mediated efflux) as well as to inhibit its uptake (7, 8).
repeated administration of amph has been shown to sensitize
monoaminergic synapses to subsequent psychostimulant challenge
(9). furthermore, administration of a single, high dose of amph
acutely (1 h) decreased dat function in vivo as assessed in striatal
synaptosomes prepared from drug-treated rats (10). in contrast,
administration of a high dose of cocaine had no effect on subsequent transporter activity (10).
to explore the mechanism for the differential effects of amph
and cocaine on the homeostatic uptake capacity of the human dat
(hdat), we stably expressed a flag-tagged hdat in em4 cells
(see materials and methods). the use of the flag fusion protein
has provided the opportunity for confocal microscopy analysis of
trafficking of the transporter in cells. here, we report that amph
caused the hdat to redistribute intracellularly in a dynamindependent manner, consequently reducing subsequent da trans-

port capacity. these results provide a mechanism for the amphinduced elevation of synaptic da mediated through a reduction of
the number of transporters on the cell surface.

cell culture. we created a synthetic hdat gene, which was tagged

at the amino terminus with a flag epitope. the gene encodes a
protein with an amino acid sequence identical to that of wild-type
hdat with the met at position 1 replaced by mdykddddka,
but the nucleotide sequence was altered to increase the number of
unique restriction sites and to optimize codon utilization. the
nucleotide sequence of this construct and its creation will be
described elsewhere. the flag-tagged syntheticdat was subcloned into a bicistronic expression vector that expresses the
syntheticdat from a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hygromycin resistance gene from an internal ribosomal entry site. this
vector, pcihyg, was constructed by replacing the nsii to xhoi
fragment from pcin4 (11) (kindly provided by s. rees, glaxo
wellcome) with the nsii to xhoi fragment from pireshygro
(clontech). the final construct is referred to as flag-hdat,
whereas the non-flag-tagged hdat construct is referred to as
hdat. (some biotinylation experiments also were done in a
flag-hemagglutinin hdat construct, in which the first 22 residues of the hdat sequence in flag-hdat were replaced by a
hemagglutinin tag.)
em4 cells, human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells stably
transfected with macrophage scavenger to increase their adherence
to tissue culture plastic (12), were kindly provided by r. horlick

with the flag-hdat with lipofectamine (gibco兾brl) as
described (13), and a stably transfected pool was selected in
hygromycin (250 ␮g兾ml). cells were grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs at 37°c and 5% co2. in addition, in some
experiments, hek 293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type
hdat cdna in pcin4 as described (13) were used.

transient expression of dominant negative dynamin. the stable

flag-hdat expressing em4 cells were transiently transfected
with the human wild-type and k44a mutant dynamin i in pcb1
by using the calcium phosphate transfection method with overnight incubation in the presence of 1 ␮g of dna per 35-mm dish
(immunofluorescence assays) and 0.25 ␮g per well of a 24-well
plate (uptake assays). forty-eight hours after transfection, the
cells were treated with either amph or vehicle for 1 h at 37°c
in uptake buffer, and uptake was determined as described above
except  xxxd1891xxx °c for 2 min in a final volume of 250 ␮l of uptake
buffer containing 50 nm [3h]da, 100 ␮m  xxxd228xxx , and 100
␮m  xxxd2850xxx . the transfection efficiency was 70–80% as assessed by fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (gfp) in parallel transient transfection with pgreen
lanterntm-1 (gibco兾brl) (data not shown).
immunofluorescence analysis. to examine the localization and trafficking of the hdat in the flag-hdat cell line, cells were treated
with amph (2 ␮m) at 37°c for 1 h unless otherwise stated.
preincubations of 20 min were done for experiments involving con
a (250 ␮g兾ml), mz (3 ␮m),  xxxd2746xxx  (2 ␮m), and cocaine (3
␮m), followed by the addition of amph. the immunostaining
steps were conducted at room temperature while rocking the cells
on a rotating platform. the coverslips containing the cells (50–70%
confluent) were washed twice with pbs (154 mm nacl兾11 mm
na2hpo4兾2.7 mm kcl兾1 mm mgcl2兾0.1 mm cacl2, ph 7.4).
they then were fixed for 25 min with 4% paraformaldehyde made
up in pbs. the cells were rinsed twice with pbs and blocked with
5% normal goat serum diluted in 0.05% triton x-100兾pbs (pbst)
for 1 h. the blocking solution then was aspirated and the cells were
rinsed once with pbst. the coverslips were incubated with the
primary antibody (anti-flag m-2 mab, sigma #f3165) at a
dilution of 1:3,000 in pbst for 1 h. the primary antibody was
aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with pbst for
5 min per incubation. after washing, the cells were incubated
with secondary antibody [goat anti-mouse igg (h&l) tritc,
saunders et al.

kirkegarrd & perry laboratories #03–18-06] diluted 1:200 in pbst
for 1 h. the secondary antibody was removed and the cells were
washed three times with pbst (5-min incubations each), and once
with pbs. coverslips then were mounted onto slides with crystal
mount (biomedia, foster city, ca) and allowed to dry. confocal
microscopy was performed by using a bio-rad mrc1024 confocal
imaging system operated via a nikon diaphot inverted microscope.
sample illumination was via a krypton-argon laser with 568-nm
excitation and a 598 ⫾ 40-nm emission filter. lasersharp acquisition software (bio-rad) allowed for z-resolution imaging at 1-␮m
increments.
biochemical analysis of transporter endocytosis using cleavable
biotin. cell surface biotinylation with cleavable sulfo-n-

hydroxysuccinimide-s-s-biotin (0.25 mg兾ml) (pierce) and glutathione strip to cleave all surface-localized biotinylated transporter
were performed on stably transfected em4 cells expressing flagdat (or flag-hemagglutinin-dat) as described (14). after
biotinylation but before the strip, cells were incubated for 1 h at
37°c in dmem supplemented or not with 2 ␮m d-amph. cells
were scraped into pbs-pi buffer (pbs supplemented with 1 ␮g兾ml
leupeptin, 1 ␮g兾ml pepstatin, 2 ␮g兾ml aprotinin, 2 ␮g兾ml pefablock, and 10 mm  xxxd2684xxx ). cells were pelleted at 4°c and
incubated in pbs-pi supplemented with 0.2% digitonin at 4°c for
20 min. cells were pelleted and then incubated in lysis buffer
(pbs-pi containing 1% triton x-100) at 4°c for 45 min. the extract
was centrifuged at 4°c (14,000 ⫻ g) for 30 min. an aliquot of the
extract was removed for determination of total dat. the remaining extract was incubated with 50 ␮l neutravidin plus beads
(pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. the beads were washed twice
with lysis buffer and then eluted with sds sample buffer containing
100 mm dtt. the crude extracts and the eluted proteins were
resolved by sds兾page, transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membranes (millipore), and blocked for 1 h in 5% dry milk, 1%
bsa, 0.1% tween-20 in tris-buffered saline. flag-dat (or
flag-hemagglutinin-dat) was detected by anti-flag m-2 primary antibody and anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology), with ecl-plus (amersham
pharmacia) and fluorescence detection and quantitation on a
storm 840 imager (molecular dynamics).
electrophysiology. parental or stably transfected cells were plated at

a density of 105 per 35-mm culture dish. before electrical recording
(performed at 25°c) attached cells were washed three times with
bath solution at room temperature. the bath contained: 130 mm
nacl, 1.3 mm kcl, 1.3 mm kh2po4, 0.5 mm mgso2, 1.5 mm
cacl2, 10 mm hepes, and 34 mm dextrose. the solution was
adjusted to ph 7.35 and 300 mosm with 1 m naoh and dextrose.
pipette solutions for the whole-cell recording contained: 130 mm
kcl, 0.1 mm cacl2, 2 mm mgcl2, 1.1 mm egta, 10 mm hepes,
and 30 mm dextrose adjusted to ph 7.35 and 270 mosm. free ca2⫹
in the pipette was calculated as 0.1 ␮m. electrodes were pulled with
a programmable puller (sutter instruments, novato, ca, p-2000).
series conductance was 0.1 ␮s or greater, and cell capacitance was
25 to 80 pf. voltage steps ranged from ⫺140 to ⫹60 mv and lasted
500 msec. between test pulses membrane potential was held at ⫺40
mv for 4 sec. values for steady-state currents were taken between
400 and 500 msec after the step. an axopatch 200b amplifier
band-limited at 5,000 hz was used to measure current. data were
stored digitally on vcr and analyzed on a nicolet integra oscilloscope and a pentium computer, using instrumentation and programs written by w.n. goolsby (emory university, atlanta, available on request).

flag-hdat cells were preincubated with or without 2 ␮m
d-amph (sigma) in serum-free dmem (gibco) for 1 h at
37°c, unless stated otherwise. one millimolar tropolone (sigma)
was added during the last 10 min of the incubation. the plate of
cells was placed on ice and washed three times with 200 ␮l
ice-cold uptake buffer (130 mm nacl兾1.3 mm kcl兾10 mm

glucose, ph 7.4). after the washes, the cells were placed on a
37°c plate warmer, and [3h]da (nen) uptake was performed
immediately. in triplicate wells, 7 nm [3h]da together with 3
␮m da was added in a final volume of 50 ␮l unless otherwise
stated. all reagents were diluted in uptake buffer prewarmed to
37°c. the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 1 min and then
aspirated to terminate uptake. after three washes with ice-cold
buffer, cells were permeabilized with 50 ␮l 0.1% triton x-100.
radioactivity was measured in a trilux scintillation counter with
optiphase supermix mixture (wallac, gaithersburg, md). specific uptake was defined as total uptake less nonspecific in the
presence of 5 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx  (mz).
the experimental determination of km and vmax after treatment with amph or vehicle was done as described above with
several modifications. cells were treated for 4 h with 40 ␮g兾ml
cycloheximide at 37°c in serum-free dmem to block the
potential contribution of newly synthesized transporter coming
to the cell surface during the uptake assay. to minimize internalization during the assessment of uptake, the uptake experiments were done at 18°c for 2 min. [3h]da (100 nm) was used
with nine concentrations of unlabeled da between 0.03 ␮m and
60 ␮m, and the data were fit by homologous competition by
nonlinear regression (prism, graphpad, san diego).

substrate and 10 ␮m mz. the substrate-induced current had a
similar steady-state voltage dependence in the hdat and the
flag-hdat cell line.
confocal microscopy images of the immunofluorescence of the
non-flag-tagged hdat cell showed no staining with the antibody
directed against the flag epitope, as seen in fig. 1b. in fig. 1c,
however, a strong peripheral cell surface staining pattern was
observed with the flag-hdat cells. this is consistent with the
steady-state localization of a gfp-hdat fusion construct in
mdck cells (18). the immunofluorescence in fig. 1c is almost
exclusively on the cell surface, as evidenced by sectioning through
the cells at 1-␮m steps (fig. 1d) in the x-z plane. a very small
amount of intracellular fluorescence was observed, however, which
might be caused by anterograde and retrograde trafficking of the
transporter under steady-state conditions.
these data show that the flag-hdat retained the functional
characteristics of the hdat, including affinity for da, maximal
rate of transport, voltage dependence of the substrate-induced
current, and predominant steady-state cell surface localization.

the whole-cell steady-state current recorded upon da bath application minus
the current obtained in the presence of da and mz at a defined membrane
voltage. the membrane potential was held at ⫺40 mv, stepping the voltage
between ⫺140 and 0 mv for 500 msec, with an interval of 4 sec. data were
normalized at ⫺140 mv. confocal microscopy images of hdat cells reveal no
significant fluorescence (b), whereas confocal images of the flag-hdat cells
show a strong cell surface staining pattern (c). z sections of the flag-hdat

inward currents in untransfected cells. thus, the em4 cells
provided a suitable null background in which to study the
function and trafficking of hdat stimulated by amph.
characterization of the flag-hdat cell line. the regulation of dat

by intracellular signaling, and in particular by protein kinase c, has
been described (15–18). using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, those authors demonstrated that trafficking of
dat can play a role in the function of the transporter. the ability
to use a flag-hdat fusion protein for immunocytochemistry in
parallel with uptake and electrophysiological strategies offers a
means to understand whether hdat cell surface distribution is
regulated by substrates and by inhibitors of the carrier.
addition of the n-terminal flag tag did not significantly
alter [3h]da uptake by the transporter, which had a km of 1.2 ⫾
0.3 ␮m and a vmax of 239 ⫾ 42 fmol兾min per well (n ⫽ 3). the
function of the transporter was further assessed electrophysiologically. as seen in fig. 1a, the flag tag did not perturb the
ability of the transporter to produce substrate-induced currents.
in the whole-cell configuration, the membrane potential of the
cell was held at ⫺40 mv and then the voltage was stepped to a
new potential between ⫺140 mv and 0 mv in 20-mv increments.
the application of da or amph induced a substrate-mediated
current (19, 20) in both the hdat and the flag-hdat cells.
the substrate-induced current was defined as the current recorded at a particular voltage in the presence of substrate (in
these experiments, 100 ␮m da) at steady state, minus the
current recorded at the same potential in the presence of the

2 ␮m amph for 1 h, the uptake of [3h]da was significantly
decreased (78 ⫾ 5% relative to control) (n ⫽ 5; p ⬍ 0.01 by paired
student’s t test). this decrease in uptake was caused by a decrease
in vmax, without a change in km [km was 1.2 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m for both
vehicle and amph treatment; vmax was 239 ⫾ 42 and 189 ⫾ 35
fmol兾min per well for vehicle and amph treatment, respectively
(n ⫽ 3; p ⬍ 0.025 by paired student’s t test)]. a similar decrease in
uptake was observed after preincubation with 10 ␮m da (73 ⫾ 4%
relative to control) (n ⫽ 5; p ⬍ 0.01 by paired student’s t test).
to further evaluate the reduction of dat functional activity
upon amph treatment, we evaluated the time dependence of
amph-induced currents. fig. 2a shows that a bath application of
2 ␮m amph generated an inward current in flag-hdat cells.
in the whole-cell configuration, the voltage was stepped from a
holding potential of ⫺40 mv to ⫺120 mv for 500 msec while
recording a control current (control). after perfusing the cell with
2 ␮m amph, an increase of the steady-state inward current
(amph) was detected. both currents were blocked by addition of
3 ␮m mz with amph still present (amph & mz). mz by
reducing the control current is unmasking the existence of an
hdat leak current that has been described both for the hdat and
other neurotransmitter transporters (19–22). the amph-induced
current was defined as the current recorded in the presence of
amph, minus the current recorded after addition of mz to the
bath with amph still present, and was analyzed as a function of
time (between 0 and 40 min). the amph-induced current reached
stability between 1 and 2 min after the addition of amph, and then
decreased in a sigmoidal fashion over time. the time until the onset
of this decreasing phase varied from cell to cell [between 5 and 14
min, averaging 8.75 ⫾ 1.93 min (sem, n ⫽ 4) after amph
application]. to compare the rates of decline between different
cells, time 0 was defined as the experimental time point 2 min before
the amph-induced current began to decline. the current was
normalized to the amph-induced current recorded at time 0 and
plotted over time (fig. 2b). because the equilibrium potential of the
amph-induced current was stable at ⫺7.9 ⫾ 1.7 mv during the
duration of the experiments, it is unlikely that the loss of functional
hdat activity estimated by measuring the amph-induced current
was caused by either a loss of ion gradients or by an intracellular
accumulation of amph. it is noteworthy that amph reduced the
substrate-induced currents to a greater extent than it reduced
[3h]da uptake. thus, amph may have additional effects on the
ionic movements generated by substrate-induced dat activity that
cannot be detected in uptake assays (see below). alternatively, the
difference in the magnitude of the effect may result from differences between single cells assayed under voltage clamp as comsaunders et al.

fig. 2. amph-induced loss of hdat function and
hdat cell surface expression. (a) whole-cell currents
recorded from flag-hdat cells. in this representative
experiment, the cell was held at ⫺40 mv and then the
voltage was stepped to ⫺120 mv for 500 msec. the
labels refer to: control current before addition of substrate (control), current after addition of 2 ␮m amph
to the bath (amph), and inhibited current after addition of 5 ␮m mz to the bath (amph & mz) with amph
still present. (b) amph induced a loss of hdat wholecell current over time. cells were held at ⫺40 mv and
then the voltage was stepped to ⫺120 mv for 500 msec
every 1–2 min. upon amph bath application, the hdat
inward current increased, reaching the maximum
value over a time of 1–2 min. after several minutes of
stability, the amph-induced current began to decrease. from this point, the amph-induced current
recorded at ⫺120 mv was plotted against time (each
symbol type represents a single cell; n ⫽ 4). the current
recorded during the different experimental time
points was normalized to the amph-induced current
recorded at a virtual time 0 (2 min before the onset of
the decreasing phase). (c) confocal microscopy images

concentration dependent, as a greater loss of cell surface transporter was seen at 50 ␮m compared with 2 ␮m amph (data not
shown). however, 2 ␮m amph, a value approximating the km
for amph (20), was chosen to facilitate the removal of amph
in subsequent uptake assays. cell surface redistribution of hdat
was also evident with da at 100 ␮m (data not shown). taken
together, these data imply that there is a substrate-induced
down-regulation of the hdat activity, which is likely a consequence of cell surface redistribution of the transporter.
inhibitors of dat, such as cocaine and mz, block the amph-induced
loss of cell surface flag-hdat. pretreatment of the flag-hdat

pared with determinations of [3h]da uptake in unclamped populations of cells.
amph-induced loss of transporter activity was further investigated by using confocal microscopy. amph (2 ␮m) caused a
significant intracellular accumulation of flag-hdat, as seen
in fig. 2c: the cell surface fluorescence intensity became weaker
with a significant amount of transporter found in the cytosol.
confocal microscopy images of 1 ␮m z-sectioning (fig. 2c)
illustrate that the fluorescence shifted substantially from the cell
surface to the intracellular compartment, and intracellular vesicles are now clearly visible in the gallery of the 1-␮m steps from
the top to the bottom of the cells. the loss of cell surface
transporter caused by 2 ␮m amph was seen as early as 20 min
(data not shown) and was maximal at 1 h, the incubation time
chosen for further studies. the amph phenomenon was also

shown in fig. 3b. the lack of significant intracellular fluorescence
in the presence of either amph plus cocaine or amph plus mz
is evident in the 1-␮m z-sections (fig. 3 e and f) from the top to
the bottom of the cells. neither mz nor cocaine caused internalization when applied in the absence of amph (data not shown).
cocaine, which impaired the amph-induced trafficking of
hdat, also blocked the amph-induced inhibition of [3h]da
uptake (fig. 3g). fig. 3g shows that the amph-mediated
inhibition of [3h]da uptake (22 ⫾ 5%) (n ⫽ 5; p ⬍ 0.01 by
paired student’s t test) was significantly attenuated when the
flag-hdat cells where pretreated (20 min) and coincubated
with 3 ␮m cocaine (5 ⫾ 4%) (n ⫽ 5; p ⬍ 0.05 by paired student’s
t test). thus, different classes of psychostimulants, such as
amph and cocaine, appear to have opposite effects on the cell
surface distribution and functional activity of hdat.
amph-induced loss of cell surface hdat is an internalization event
that is dynamin dependent and results in reduced transporter
capacity. the increase in intracellular flag-hdat caused by

amph may be caused by sequestration and internalization of the
transporter or result from nascent transporter being held up in the
cytosol (i.e., hdat never reached the cell surface). to test this,
flag-hdat expressing cells were pretreated with 250 ␮g兾ml of
con a to prevent internalization by stabilizing cell surface integrity
caused by tetravalent lectin contacts (23). as seen in fig. 4,
pretreatment with con a (fig. 4b) largely prevented the amphmediated loss of cell surface flag-hdat (fig. 4a). preincubation
with con a in the absence of amph resulted in an immunofluorescence profile similar to that of control (data not shown).
cell-surface biotinylation experiments also demonstrated the
presence of amph-induced internalization. incubation with 2 ␮m
amph for 1 h resulted in 27.1 ⫾ 7.9% internalization (n ⫽ 4). this
demonstrates that amph produced its effect through hdat
internalization and not by interfering with the delivery of the
protein to the cell surface. the extent of internalization was similar
to the extent of inhibition of uptake.
to examine the cellular mechanism by which this endocytotic
phenomenon occurred, we explored the possible role of clathrincoated pits by coexpressing the flag-hdat with a dominant
negative mutant of dynamin i (k44a) or wild-type dynamin i.
dynamin is a gtpase that catalyzes the pinching off of clathrincoated pits from the cell surface (24, 25). coexpression with
k44a (fig. 4c) inhibited the amph-mediated internalization of
flag-hdat whereas wild-type dynamin (fig. 4d) did not.
similarly, transient overexpression of k44a has been shown to
block internalization of g protein-coupled receptors (26, 27).
these data suggest that amph-mediated internalization of
hdat may require clathrin-coated pits. although dynamin also
has been suggested to play a role in the budding of caveolae (28,
29) as well as in signal transduction (30, 31), a clathrin-mediated
internalization of the hdat by amph seems more likely. a
similar block by k44a dynamin of  xxxd2925xxx -mediated
internalization of gfp-hdat in mdck cells has been reported
(18), and this was interpreted as a clathrin-mediated mechanism
as well.
we examined whether the amph-induced decrease in da
uptake (fig. 3g) was a direct effect of the flag-hdat internalization process itself, rather than a reduction in the maximal rate of
transport mediated by enzymatic modification of the transporter,
such as phosphorylation. the flag-hdat cell line was transiently
transected with either wild-type or k44a dynamin, or neither. after
1 h preincubation with 2 ␮m amph, da uptake was significantly
decreased, both in flag-hdat cells (56 ⫾ 17% relative to
control) (n ⫽ 3; p ⬍ 0.05 by paired student’s t test) and flaghdat cells transiently transfected with wild-type dynamin 1 (52 ⫾
20% relative to control) (n ⫽ 3; p ⬍ 0.05 by paired student’s t test).
in contrast, uptake in cells transiently transfected with k44a was
unaffected by pretreatment with amph (103 ⫾ 3% relative to

control) (n ⫽ 3). these data further support amph-induced
internalization of hdat as being responsible for the decrease of
transporter activity observed with acute amph treatment.
although it is well known that amph increases the concentration of da at the synaptic cleft, the underlying mechanism has
been under considerable debate. changes in hdat activity and
the extracellular da concentration caused by amph have been
ascribed to a counter transport mechanism by the carrier (7, 32).
regulation of transporter surface distribution may represent an
additional mechanism by which neurons modulate transport
capacity in response to psychostimulants such as amph as well
as elevated levels of extracellular da. in fact, our data show that
acute exposure to amph in flag-hdat cells reduced surface
transport activity, as assessed by [3h]da uptake, amphinduced currents (figs. 2b and 3g), and cell surface localization
of flag-hdat as determined with both confocal microscopy
(fig. 2c) and cell surface biotinylation.
saunders et al.

single high doses of amph and methamphetamine were
found to reduce [3h]da uptake in synaptosomes prepared from
the striatum of rat brains 1 h after drug administration without
altering the amount of overall hdat protein (10, 33). this
decrease resulted from a decrease in transporter vmax that
recovered within 24 h. our in vitro finding of amph-induced
hdat internalization may provide a potential mechanism for
these observations. curiously, methamphetamine administration did not reduce uptake in the nucleus accumbens (33),
suggesting that this effect may not occur in all brain regions and
may be subject to complex regulation.
because hdat controls da clearance from the extracellular
fluid, a decrease in the number of transporters on the cell surface
because of amph exposure would result in an increase in
extracellular da. therefore, loss of membrane transporter
number might contribute to neurotoxicity by decreasing da
clearance, and consequently increasing extracellular da (34,
35). conversely, a reduction of cell surface hdat may be a
neuroprotective mechanism in that it could diminish the amount
of carriers available for da efflux upon amph stimulation.
cocaine inhibits the ability of hdat to traffic in response to
amph stimulation, indicating that there are different mechanisms of action for these two psychostimulants. transport blockers, such as mz and  xxxd2746xxx , appear to behave like cocaine.
therefore, hdat ligands capable of inhibiting dat activity
(e.g., cocaine, mz, and  xxxd2746xxx ) may not only act by
preventing the reuptake of substrate, but also by preventing the
internalization of transporter itself.
a number of studies have implicated internalization of neurotransmitter transporters as a possible means of modulating transporter activity (15, 36–39). in human embryonic kidney 293 cells,
serotonin (5ht) was found to inhibit the  xxxd2925xxx -mediated
phosphorylation, and the associated internalization, of the serotonin transporter (sert) (39). a homeostatic mechanism was proposed for this effect, in that elevated synaptic levels of 5ht could
prevent the internalization of sert and thereby maintain effective
levels of the transporter at the cell surface where it would help to
clear the elevated 5ht. similarly, a 1-h exposure to ␥-aminobutyric
acid was shown to slow internalization of  xxxg2143xxx , another member
of this gene family (40). interestingly, the effect we observed in
dat, in the same parental line of cells as the sert studies, is
opposite to that reported with sert and  xxxg2143xxx , suggesting a

markedly different mechanism of regulation of these closely related
transporters.
a recent study with a gfp-hdat fusion protein stably
expressed in mdck cells reported that 10 ␮m da did not
significantly affect the cellular distribution of gfp fluorescence
(18). whether this discrepancy with our data relates to the
concentration of da, to an impairment in substrate-mediated
internalization of gfp-dat related to the presence of the
n-terminal gfp ‘‘tag’’ compared with the much smaller flag
tag, or from differences in the cell lines used is not yet clear.
it should be noted that amph decreased flag-hdatmediated currents more rapidly and to a greater extent than it
reduced da uptake or produced internalization. thus, it is possible
that amph caused a modification of the transporter, such as
phosphorylation, which rapidly decreased substrate-induced currents. indeed, the regulation of dat by phorbol esters, presumably
mediated by protein kinase c, has been described (15–18). clearly,
however, at 1 h amph-induced internalization of hdat and
decreased uptake was blocked by dominant negative dynamin i,
suggesting that these effects also depend on endocytosis and cannot
be fully explained simply by a modification of the transporter.
moreover, we see evidence of internalization by cell surface biotinylation of a magnitude relatively consistent with the observed
changes in uptake, but less than the amph-induced reduction in
current. thus, the inactivation of hdat upon amph application
is largely but perhaps not exclusively controlled by the trafficking of
this carrier.
taken together our data suggest that cell surface redistribution of hdat is a mechanism that contributes to the enhancement of extracellular da levels in response to psychostimulants
such as amph. greater understanding of this pathway and its
mechanistic details may lead to novel cellular targets for substance abuse therapies.
