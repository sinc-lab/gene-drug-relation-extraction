differences between binding of one-chain and two-chain tissue plasminogen activators to non-cross-linked and cross-linked fibrin clots.  interaction of tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ) with fibrin plays a key role in regulation of plasminogen activation and clot dissolution. previous investigations of  xxxg1766xxx -fibrin interaction, using incorporation of  xxxg1766xxx  into polymerizing fibrin clots, have suggested that no significant differences exist in the binding of one-chain or two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  to non-cross-linked or cross-linked fibrin. in the present study, binding of 125i-labeled and affinity-purified one-chain and two-chain forms of  xxxg1766xxx  to preformed non-cross-linked or cross-linked, sonicated suspension of fibrin was investigated. interaction of one-chain  xxxg1766xxx  with cross-linked fibrin involved a single type of binding site with dissociation constant (kd) of 0.58 mumol/l and a stoichiometry (n) of 1.5. interaction of one-chain  xxxg1766xxx  with non-cross-linked fibrin, however, involved two classes of binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.32 and 1.5 mumol/l and corresponding number of binding sites equal to 0.57 and 2.0, respectively. in contrast to the binding of one-chain  xxxg1766xxx  to cross-linked fibrin by a limited number of sites, two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  appeared to involve a considerably greater number of sites (minimum six) whose dissociation constant was 3.2 mumol/l. interaction of two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  with non-cross-linked fibrin also showed the presence of many binding sites (minimum seven) with approximate dissociation constant of 6.4 mumol/l, as well as a few (n = 0.012) high-affinity sites with a kd of 0.011 mumol/l epsilon- xxxd146xxx  did not completely reverse the binding of either one-chain  xxxg1766xxx  or two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  to fibrin. the present findings suggest that the fibrin-binding properties of  xxxg1766xxx  undergo considerable changes on proteolytic conversion from one-chain to two-chain  xxxg1766xxx , catalyzed under physiologic conditions by plasmin. the cleavage of one-chain  xxxg1766xxx  to two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  allows to bind to a large number of low-affinity binding sites on fibrin. cross-linking of fibrin by  xxxg744xxx  results in masking of high-affinity binding sites that are present in non-cross-linked fibrin. we propose that both plasmin and  xxxg744xxx  play an important regulatory role in dissolution of blood clots by modulating  xxxg1766xxx -fibrin interaction.
