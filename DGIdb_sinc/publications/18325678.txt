summary
opioids can modulate neuroendocrine function. less is known about the involvement of opioid
receptor subtypes in the stimulatory effects of opioids on the primate hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (hpa) axis. the aim of this study was to investigate the stimulatory effects of opioids
selective for each receptor subtype on plasma  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and
cortisol levels in both male and female monkeys. the blood collection procedure was
conducted in home-caged and unanesthetized rhesus monkeys that showed low and stable
basal acth and cortisol levels. three opioid receptor agonists, fentanyl, u-50488h, and
snc80, were used in behaviorally active doses; they are highly selective for mu, kappa, and
delta opioid receptors, respectively. plasma samples were collected at multiple time points
before and after iv administration of each compound and were quantified by radioimmunoassay. neither fentanyl (0.0003–0.02 mg/kg) nor snc80 (0.03–0.3 mg/kg) changed
either acth or cortisol basal levels. in contrast, u-50488h (0.01–1 mg/kg) dose-dependently
stimulated acth and cortisol release in both male and female monkeys. importantly, the
stimulatory effects of u-50488h on the secretion of acth were blocked by a selective kappa
opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine. the antagonist effect of nor-binaltorphimine
lasted up to 20 weeks. these results indicate that only synthetic kappa, but not mu or delta
opioid receptor agonists stimulate hpa axis activity after acute administration in primates.

opioid modulation of the primate hpa axis

1. introduction
the analgesic effect produced by opioids has long been used
to treat moderate to severe pain in humans (peng and
sandler, 1999; martin and eisenach, 2001). the discovery of
opioid receptor subtypes, mu, kappa, and delta opioid
receptors, has fostered more pharmacological studies of
each receptor subtype’s physiological functions. whereas
the administration of opioid receptor agonists suppress the
body’s natural response to pain, it also affects other systems
in the body, such as neuroendocrine function. the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis is an example of a
neuroendocrine system that is significantly influenced by
opioids. the secretion of hypothalamic releasing factors
and hormones from the pituitary and adrenal glands can
be stimulated or inhibited depending on which opioid
receptor subtype is activated (pechnick, 1993; mellon and
bayer, 1998).
there are numerous contradictions in the literature
regarding the effects of opioids on the hpa axis. for
example, human studies using mu opioid analgesics, such
as morphine, fentanyl, and buprenorphine, have indicated
an inhibitory role of mu opioid receptors in the modulation
of hpa activity (mcdonald et al., 1959; zis et al., 1984;
pende et al., 1986; hoehe et al., 1988). conversely, mu
opioid receptor agonists have been shown to increase
plasma  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and corticosterone levels in rodents and other non-primate species
(iyengar et al., 1987; nikolarakis et al., 1987; ignar and
kuhn, 1990; gonzalvez et al., 1991; pechnick, 1993). these
differences have led to different interpretations for the
effects of opioid receptor antagonists and the expected
roles of endogenous opioids in the regulation of hpa axis. it
is clear that differences in the species used, as well as the
receptor binding selectivity, doses, and administration
routes of opioid compounds could contribute to different
results. nevertheless, the use of opioid analgesics as part of
anesthesia may alter the hpa response to the surgery, and
the hpa responses to other stressors may be altered in
individuals who take opioids for the pain medication or who
abuse opioids. therefore, it is important to study the acute
effects of opioid agonists selective for each receptor
subtype on regulating the hpa activity in non-human
primates.
although most opioid analgesics used for the clinical
management of pain are  xxxg1635xxx  agonists,
studies using monkeys have suggested that kappa and delta
opioid receptor agonists have therapeutic potential as
analgesics and for other indications (dykstra et al., 1987;
butelman et al., 1993; negus et al., 1998; brandt et al.,
2001). despite their clinical potential, the interaction of
kappa and  xxxg1632xxx  agonists on the hpa axis has
not been extensively studied in primates. there is one
human study showing that a  xxxg1633xxx  agonist
stimulated cortisol release in men (ur et al., 1997). the
effect of a  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist on this effect
was not determined, so it is uncertain that the stimulation
was via the kappa opioid receptors. we have reported that a
 xxxg1633xxx -selective antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni), produced a transient increase in plasma
acth and cortisol concentrations in monkeys (williams
et al., 2003), but the duration of nor-bni-stimulated hpa

479
activity (i.e., 3 h) was much shorter than its typical long
duration of  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist action
(i.e., 3–5 weeks) (butelman et al., 1993; ko et al., 1999).
prior studies suggest non- xxxg1633xxx  selective
actions of nor-bni in the period immediately after administration (endoh et al., 1992). given that highly selective kappa
opioid receptor agonists and antagonists are available and
their active doses have been documented in various monkey
behavioral assays (butelman et al., 1993, 1998; ko et al.,
1999, 2003), it was possible to determine the role of kappa
opioid receptor in modulating the hpa activity in monkeys.
in the previous study, we utilized indwelling iv catheters
in monkeys to show reliable and low basal acth and cortisol
levels before drug administration (williams et al., 2003).
this procedure provides the opportunity to detect stimulatory effects of test compounds in awake, behaving monkeys.
the aim of this study was, therefore, to determine whether
selective mu, kappa, and  xxxg1632xxx  agonists
increased plasma acth and cortisol levels in monkeys.
selective receptor antagonists were used to determine if the
predicted stimulatory effects were selective for mu, kappa,
or delta opioid receptors.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
eight adult male and female rhesus monkeys (macaca
mulatta), weighing 6.2–12.9 kg, were used in this experiment. these monkeys had intact gonads and adrenal glands.
the monkeys were housed individually with free access to
water and were fed approximately 25–30 biscuits (purina
monkey chow; ralston purina, st. louis, mo) and fresh fruit
daily. these monkeys had only received opioid receptor
antagonists in our previous study (williams et al., 2003).
they were not involved in any drug self-administration
studies and they had never received any opioid receptor
agonist before the present study. the female monkeys had
normal menstrual cycles, ranging between 28 and 32 days.
all monkeys were housed in facilities accredited by the
american association for the accreditation of laboratory
animal care. the studies were conducted in accordance
with the university committee on the use and care of
animals in the university of michigan and the guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals (national academy
press, washington dc, revised 1996).

2.2. apparatus
the monkeys were housed individually in 83  76  91 cm3
deep stainless steel cages (bryan research equipment
corporation, bryan, tx). initially, the monkeys were
acclimated to wearing teflon mesh jackets ( xxxd2405xxx , malone,
ny) that were attached to the backs of the cages by flexible,
stainless steel tether arms. once habituated to the cage and
the restraint device (i.e., steel tether), the monkeys had
indwelling silastic catheters inserted into their femoral vein
during aseptic surgery using 10 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg
xylazine anesthesia. upon placement in the vein, the
catheter was maneuvered subcutaneously to the midscapular region where it exited the monkey. the catheter was

480
then threaded through and protected by the stainless steel
tether and exited via the back of the cage. such an
apparatus enabled the monkey to remain conscious and to
move with minimal restraint during blood collection. the
setup and surgical procedures are described in detail
elsewhere (winger et al., 1975).

2.3. drugs
fentanyl (national institute on drug abuse, bethesda, md),
u-50488h (upjohn company, kalamazoo, mi), and nor-bni
(sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) were all dissolved in sterile
water. snc80 (dr. k.c. rice, national institute on drug
abuse, bethesda, md) was dissolved in 3% lactic acid in
sterile water. all compounds were administered intravenously through the indwelling iv catheter at a volume of
0.1 ml/kg.

2.4. experimental protocols
the first part of the study was to characterize the effects of
opioid receptor agonists on the hpa axis. four male and four
female monkeys (n ¼ 8) were used in these experiments.
a selective  xxxg1635xxx  agonist, fentanyl
(0.0003–0.02 mg/kg), a  xxxg1633xxx  agonist,
u-50488h (0.01–1 mg/kg), and a  xxxg1632xxx 
agonist, snc80 (0.03–0.3 mg/kg) at different doses were
given in a random order. each single dosing procedure was
conducted once per week. these doses of opioid receptor
agonists were chosen based on previous studies showing that
they were active doses in various behavioral assays in
monkeys (butelman et al., 1993, 1998; negus et al., 1998;
ko et al., 1998, 2002). the second part of the study was to
determine the receptor mechanism of u-50488h-evoked
acth and cortisol release. in this antagonist experiment,
one group of four monkeys (two males and two females)
received iv the selective  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist
nor-bni 3.2 mg/kg and the other group of four monkeys
(two males and two females) received iv vehicle (sterile
water, 0.1 ml/kg). the stimulatory effect of u-50488h
(0.3 mg/kg) on acth and cortisol level was determined 7
days before, and re-determined at 1 and 3 days, and 1, 3, 6,
9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 weeks after the pretreatment. the
dose of u-50488h was chosen because it was the smallest
dose that produced maximal effects in the first part of the
study. the dose of nor-bni was chosen based on a previous
study showing that nor-bni produced a selective, longlasting  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist effect at this dose
(butelman et al., 1993).

2.5. blood sample collection and measurement
every blood-sampling session began at 09:30 am (i.e., the
time point 30 in the figures) and the agonist or vehicle
injections were given  xxxd1891xxx :00 am (time 0). the sessions
ended at 13:00 pm for a total session time of 3.5 h. every
15 min for the first 1.5 h and every 30 min thereafter,
approximately 2 ml of blood were drawn. this regimen
totaled 11 blood samples per session. each blood sample was
initially placed in a 2-ml vacutainer (beckton dickinson co.,
franklin lakes, nj) containing 0.04 ml of 7.5% edta and

j.e. pascoe et al.
immediately placed on ice. the catheter was flushed with
approximately 3 ml heparinized saline (30 u/ml) after
collecting each sample. the same catheter was used for iv
drug delivery and was also flushed with 3 ml heparinized
saline after drug administration.
blood samples were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min at
4 1c. the plasma was pipetted into 2-ml cryovials (corning
costar co., cambridge, ma) and stored at 80 1c until
assayed for acth and cortisol. there was no analysis for
drug blood levels. the acth and cortisol concentrations
were measured using commercially available radioimmunoassay kits (acth: nichols institute diagnostics, san juan
capistrano, ca; cortisol: diagnostic products co., los
angeles, ca). the range of detection for the acth kit was
1–1500 pg/ml. the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients
of variation were 3–3.2% and 6–8%, respectively. the range
of detection for the cortisol kit was 0.2–50 mg/dl. the intraassay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3–5% and
4–6.5%, respectively.

2.6. data analysis
the data are displayed as the time course and the area
under curve (auc). the time course data consist of the mean
and sem of actual hormone concentrations at various time
points throughout the session. all data were analyzed by
two-way repeated measures of anova followed by the
dunnett test for multiple (post hoc) comparisons. as noted,
we did not find a significant difference in the effects of
agonists between male and female monkeys, so mean values
for all monkeys in the same condition were used for data
analysis. in addition, the trapezoidal rule was used to
calculate the auc. the reference for the calculation of the
auc for acth (pg min/ml) and cortisol (mg min/dl) was the
second sample (15 min time point). the auc was then
calculated for each subject and averaged across all
subjects. the auc data were analyzed by using one-way
repeated measures of anova followed by the dunnett test
for multiple comparisons. the significance criterion for all
data was set at po0.05, and po0.01.

3. results

plasma of monkeys receiving opioid receptor agonists.
neither the  xxxg1635xxx  agonist fentanyl
[f(5,35) ¼ 1.1, p ¼ 0.4] nor the  xxxg1632xxx 
agonist snc80 [f(3,21) ¼ 1.6, p ¼ 0.2] stimulated acth
release. as noted, a higher dose of fentanyl was not
evaluated due to the risk of respiratory arrest. a higher
dose of snc80 (i.e., 1 mg/kg) produced convulsions in the
first two subjects; therefore, the effect of snc80 was only
tested up to 0.3 mg/kg. the duration of snc80-induced
convulsions was not assessed because diazepam was used
immediately to treat convulsing subjects. in contrast,
u-50488h dose-dependently stimulated acth release
[f(5,35) ¼ 31.4, po0.01]. post hoc comparisons indicated
that both 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of u-50488h significantly
increased the release of acth between 15 and 180 min
following iv administration (po0.01). in addition, figure 2

increased the values of acth-auc [f(5,42) ¼ 22.7,

indicated that u-50488h at doses between 0.03 and 1 mg/kg

vehicle or nor-bni administration. the asterisk represents a significant difference from each group’s bl condition (po0.05;

comparisons indicated that nor-bni blocked u-50488hstimulated acth-auc from 3 days to 20 weeks after
administration (po0.01). nevertheless, nor-bni only
blocked u-50488h-stimulated cortisol-auc from 3 to 7 days
after administration (po0.05).

4. discussion
the present study showed that a kappa opioid receptorselective agonist, u-50488h, dose-dependently increased
plasma acth and cortisol levels in both male and female
monkeys. these results agree with an earlier study,
reporting  xxxg1633xxx  agonist-stimulated cortisol
secretion in humans (ur et al., 1997). it is worth noting that
the active doses of u-50488h (0.03–0.3 mg/kg) for both
stimulating the hpa activity and inhibiting vasopressin
release (i.e., diuresis) are similar, but they are smaller than
those (0.3–3 mg/kg) for producing antinociception and
sedation in monkeys (dykstra et al., 1987; butelman
et al., 1993; ko et al., 1999, 2003). this potency difference
indicates that  xxxg1633xxx  agonists may have
therapeutic potential as hormonal regulators, especially
for treating patients with underproduction of acth
and cortisol.

pretreatment with a  xxxg1633xxx -selective
antagonist, nor-bni 3.2 mg/kg, blocked u-50488h-stimulated acth and cortisol secretions. there was no
development of tolerance to the effects of u-50488h in
the vehicle-treated group, indicating that both factors of
time and repeated dosing regimen did not affect the
measurement of the effects of u-50488h’s in the nor-bnitreated group under these experimental conditions. these
results clearly demonstrate that the  xxxg1633xxx 
mediates the stimulatory effect of u-50488h on the hpa axis
in primates. although the study was not designed to
examine the gender difference in the effects of opioid
receptor agonists on the hpa activity, future studies with
more subjects are needed to determine whether female
monkeys have different hpa responses to opioid receptor
agonists between their follicular and luteal phases of
menstrual cycles.
the duration of nor-bni-induced blockade of u-50488hstimulated acth versus cortisol release was different
(i.e., 20 weeks versus 1 week). there may be several
factors contributing to this time course difference. for
example, it is likely that there are substantially fewer kappa
opioid receptor binding sites in anterior pituitary than in
hypothalamus (simantov and snyder, 1977; sim-selley et al.,
1999; peckys and landwehrmeyer, 1999). the high density of

article in press
484
kappa opioid receptors in the hypothalamus may play an
important role in eliciting u-50488h’s stimulatory effect on
hpa activity and may be more susceptible to the kappa
opioid receptor antagonist effect of nor-bni. in addition,
acth acts on the adrenal cortex to release cortisol into
blood (pechnick, 1993; wand and schumann, 1998; miller
and o’callaghan, 2002). repeated exposures to u-50488h in
the presence of nor-bni may gradually increase the
efficiency of acth in stimulating cortisol release.
the long duration (i.e., for weeks) of the nor-bni-induced
 xxxg1633xxx  antagonist effect is well known in the
literature (horan et al., 1992; butelman et al., 1993; jewett
and woods, 1995). nevertheless, this study presents the
longest duration (20 weeks) of  xxxg1633xxx 
antagonism in vivo following systemic administration of
nor-bni. as reported previously, nor-bni itself produced a
transient increased secretion of acth and cortisol for 2–3 h
(williams et al., 2003). it is possible that nor-bni displayed
different pharmacological actions through kappa opioid
receptors by first showing acute partial kappa opioid
receptor agonist effects following by long-term kappa
opioid receptor antagonist effects. there are other opioid
compounds that also display changing pharmacological
actions over time. for example, buprenorphine produced
acute analgesia (i.e.,  xxxg1635xxx  agonist action)
followed by long-term  xxxg1635xxx  antagonist effects
(cowan et al., 1977; walker et al., 1995). nevertheless,
additional study will be needed to verify the role of kappa
opioid receptors in the early action of nor-bni on hormonal
regulation. it will be interesting to see whether pretreatment with nor-bni blocks subsequent administration
(i.e., second administration) of nor-bni-stimulated acth
and cortisol release.
in a previous study, intracisternal administration of
nor-bni 0.32 mg significantly blocked u-50488h-induced
diuresis for 20 weeks in monkeys; this dose of nor-bni
was not an effective antagonist following systemic administration (ko et al., 2003). these results demonstrated
that central kappa opioid receptors in the hypothalamus
mediate  xxxg1633xxx  agonist-induced diuresis in
primates. together with the present findings, these
results indicate that nor-bni produces a long-lasting kappa
opioid receptor antagonist effect against kappa opioid
receptor agonist-induced hormonal regulation. although
the present study did not investigate the site of action of
u-50488h on stimulating acth release, other studies have
suggested that  xxxg1633xxx  agonists acts to
stimulate the secretion of  xxxd1752xxx -releasing factor
(crf) from the hypothalamus (buckingham and cooper,
1986; nikolarakis et al., 1987). given that the kappa
opioid receptor is abundant in the primate hypothalamus
(sim-selley et al., 1999; peckys and landwehrmeyer, 1999),
it is important to determine whether crf blockers can
modulate  xxxg1633xxx  agonist-stimulated acth
release in primates.
a  xxxg1635xxx -selective agonist, fentanyl, did
not stimulate acth and cortisol release in monkeys.
the doses of fentanyl used here have been shown to
produce antinociceptive and reinforcing effects in monkeys
(ko et al., 1998, 2002; butelman et al., 2004). this finding
differs with the reports of a stimulatory effect of mu opioid
receptor agonists on the rodent hpa axis (iyengar et al.,

j.e. pascoe et al.
1987; nikolarakis et al., 1987; ignar and kuhn, 1990;
gonzalvez et al., 1991), but it agrees with the finding of
inhibition or no effect of  xxxg1635xxx  agonists on
human hpa activity (mcdonald et al., 1959; zis et al., 1984;
hoehe et al., 1988; pechnick, 1993). on the other hand,
opioid receptor antagonists stimulate the hpa axis by
increasing plasma levels of acth and cortisol in humans,
indicating the hpa axis may be tonically inhibited by
endogenous opioids (volavka et al., 1979; morley, 1983;
jackson et al., 1995). the magnitude of acth response to
naloxone in mu opioid-dependent subjects exceeds the
magnitude of the response in nondependent, healthy
subjects given higher doses of naloxone, suggesting the
hpa axis in opioid-dependent subjects may also reflect
neuroadaptation to the basal signal activity of mu opioid
receptors (volavka et al., 1979; naber et al., 1981; rosen
et al., 1996).
a  xxxg1632xxx -selective agonist, snc80, also did
not stimulate acth and cortisol secretion in monkeys. the
doses of snc80 used here have been shown to produce
antinociceptive and other behavioral effects in monkeys
(negus et al., 1998; brandt et al., 2001). this finding differs
with the stimulatory effects of dor agonists on the rodent
hpa axis (iyengar et al., 1987; gonzalvez et al., 1991).
interestingly, the single human study reported that a delta
opioid receptor agonist, deltorphin, inhibited acth and
cortisol responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, while it
had no effect on acth and cortisol responses to crf (degli
uberti et al., 1992). given that anatomical data indicate a
sparse density of  xxxg1632xxx  mrna in the human
hypothalamus (peckys and landwehrmeyer, 1999), studies
using elevated basal levels of the hpa axis to compare the
inhibitory effects of mu and  xxxg1632xxx  agonists
will help clarify the role of delta opioid receptors in the
primate hpa axis.
it is important to note that both mu and kappa opioid
receptors are abundant in the primate hypothalamus (simselley et al., 1999; peckys and landwehrmeyer, 1999).
studies using selective mu and  xxxg1633xxx 
agonists have provided a pharmacological basis of endogenous opioids action in the modulation of the primate hpa axis.
given  xxxg1635xxx ’s inhibitory and kappa opioid
receptor’s stimulatory roles on the hpa activity, it is
expected that when endogenous opioids are released, only
dynorphin-like ligands, but not endorphin- or enkephalinlike ligands, may stimulate the hpa axis. although this study
focuses on the stimulatory effects of opioid receptor
agonists, future studies of mixed opioids with high affinity
for both mu and kappa opioid receptors such as butorphanol
(lee et al., 2007) will facilitate our understanding of
whether mu and kappa opioid receptors interact in the
primate hpa axis. in addition, the subjective effects such as
euphoria and dysphoria may not correlate with the hpa
activity. studies have indicated that drugs with abuse
liability in humans have different effects on the hpa activity.
for example, cocaine stimulated acth and cortisol secretion, but fentanyl inhibited acth and cortisol secretion
(broadbear et al., 1999, 2004). ur et al. (1997) also reported
that mild dysphoric effects were noted in some subjects
following administration of the  xxxg1633xxx 
agonist, spiradoline, but these did not correlate with the
rise of cortisol.

article in press
opioid modulation of the primate hpa axis
taken together, this study provides new and important
information on the primate hpa axis. it demonstrates that
acute administration of synthetic kappa, but not mu or delta
opioid receptor agonists stimulates the monkey hpa axis.
both mu and  xxxg1632xxx  agonists may be used as
analgesics without stimulating hpa activity. studies of
exogenous compounds selective for each opioid receptor
subtype facilitate our understanding of the roles of
endogenous opioids in the primate hpa activity. kappa
opioid receptor agonists and antagonists may have some
utility in the treatment of neuroendocrine disorders
(i.e., underproduction or overproduction of acth). given
the corresponding anatomical evidence, mu and kappa
opioid receptor agonists can be used to test the functional
integrity of the primate hpa axis. the study supports the use
of the non-human primate model for exploring and predicting effects of opioids on hormones secreted by the
hypothalamus and the pituitary in humans (bowen et al.,
2002; butelman et al., 1999, 2007).
