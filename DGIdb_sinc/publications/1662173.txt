interaction of  xxxd364xxx  tosylate with guinea-pig myocardial na(+)-k(+)-atpase.  1. the effects of  xxxd364xxx  on myocardial mg(2+)-dependent, na(+)-k(+)-atpase ( xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3) activity were compared with those of ouabain in guinea-pig heart preparations. 2. both ouabain and  xxxd364xxx  inhibited microsomal na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity in a concentration-dependent fashion in the range of 0.01-100 and 1.0-4000 microm, respectively. the ic50 values were 1.93 +/- 0.27 microm for ouabain and 2.45 +/- 0.17 mm for  xxxd364xxx . 3. in another set of experiments, the effects of  xxxd364xxx  on the enzyme activity were tested in combination with 2.5 or 5.0 microm ouabain. 4. the combined effects of the two drugs resulted in a net reduction in the total inhibitory activities of the individual drugs, which became more marked the higher the  xxxd364xxx  concentration. this trend seems to suggest a competitive mode of interaction of the two drugs in their inhibitory actions on na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity. 5. the results demonstrate therefore that  xxxd364xxx  is a potent inhibitor of ouabain-inhibited atp hydrolysis by myocardial na(+)-k(+)-atpase. these actions may be pertinent with regard to some of its cardiac actions.
