(vi) treatment of s. cerevisiae with azole or  xxxd3314xxx 
resulted in transcriptional upregulation of genes
fks2 and  xxxg214xxx  known to be ca2+ regulated. a model
to explain the role of ca2+-regulated signalling in
azole/ xxxd3314xxx  tolerance is proposed.

summary

introduction

the most important group of antifungals is the azoles
(e.g.  xxxd2640xxx ), which act by inhibiting lanosterol
demethylase in the sterol biosynthesis pathway.
azole activity can be modulated through structural
changes in lanosterol demethylase, altered expression of its gene erg11, alterations in other sterol
biosynthesis enzymes or altered expression of multidrug transporters. we present evidence that azole
activity versus saccharomyces cerevisiae is also
modulated by ca2+-regulated signalling. (i) azole
activity was reduced by the addition of ca2+. conversely, azole activity was enhanced by the addition
of ca2+ chelator egta. (ii) three structurally distinct
inhibitors (fluphenazine, calmidazolium and a w-7
analogue) of the ca2+-binding regulatory protein calmodulin enhanced azole activity. (iii) two structurally
distinct inhibitors (cyclosporin and fk506) of the
ca2+-calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin
enhanced azole activity. (iv) strains in which the ca2+
binding sites of calmodulin were eliminated and
strains in which the calcineurin subunit genes were
disrupted demonstrated enhanced azole sensitivity;
conversely, a mutant with constitutively activated calcineurin phosphatase demonstrated decreased azole
sensitivity. (v) crz1/ xxxg2255xxx  encodes a transcription
factor regulated by calcineurin phosphatase; its disruption enhanced azole sensitivity, whereas its overexpression decreased azole sensitivity. all the above
treatments had comparable effects on the activity of
 xxxd3314xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg2197xxx  within
the sterol biosynthesis pathway, but had little or no
effect on the activity of drugs with unrelated targets.

opportunistic fungal infections have increased dramatically in recent years as a result of increased immunosuppression associated with aids, organ and bone marrow
transplantation and aggressive treatment of cancer and
autoimmune disorders. the yeast candida albicans is the
most commonly encountered fungal pathogen, primarily
because it is normal mucosal flora in most humans.
many non-immunosuppressed individuals also suffer from
relatively benign candidiasis of the vaginal tract, skin or
nails. treatment or prophylaxis of c. albicans infection
most often uses an azole antifungal, e.g.  xxxd2640xxx ,
fluconazole or itraconazole. azoles inhibit lanosterol
14a-demethylase, one of about 20 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway leading to ergosterol, the major
fungal membrane sterol (for a review, see lees et al.,
1999). remarkably, this pathway is the arget of three
additional antifungal classes: allylamines (e.g.  xxxd3314xxx ), thiocarbamates and morpholines (for a review, see
georgopapadakou and walsh, 1996).
a major limitation of azole antifungals is their general
lack of fungicidal activity. as a result, many individuals
require long-term treatment, and this in turn frequently
results in the selection of azole-resistant fungal strains (for
a review, see white et al., 1998). these in vivo limitations
of azoles have in vitro correlates: the ‘trailing’ or background growth observed in broth dilution or agar diffusion
assays with many c. albicans isolates (ruhnke et al.,
1996; revankar et al., 1998; rex et al., 1998; marr et al.,
1999). that is, fully susceptible c. albicans cultures maintain a slow but consistent rate of growth at azole concentrations well above the minimum inhibitory concentration
(mic; typically defined as the concentration inhibiting
growth by 80%). consequently, increased incubation time
(e.g. 48 h versus 24 h) can lead to large increases in mic.
we refer to this as azole tolerance to distinguish it from
azole resistance. however, tolerance is not limited to

fig. 1. model of ca2+-regulated signalling in s. cerevisiae (see text
for references and further details). ca2+ (from external environment
or internal stores) binds to calmodulin, which then binds to and
activates specific proteins including calcineurin phosphatase and the
protein kinases cmk1p and cmk2p. the only known substrate for
activated calcineurin is crz1p/tcn1p; dephosphorylation results in its
translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, where it activates the transcription of multiple genes including fks2 (one of two genes encoding b-1,3-glucan synthase) and  xxxg214xxx  (encoding a golgi-localized
ca2+/mn2+ importer). sites of action of calmodulin antagonists (e.g.
fluphenazine) and calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. fk506) are indicated;
note that the latter must first bind to specific peptidyl prolyl
isomerases (e.g. the fkbp immunophilin homologue encoded by
fpr1).

calcineurin phosphatase is activated by the ca2+binding protein calmodulin, also highly conserved among
eukaryotes. in s. cerevisiae, calmodulin is encoded by
cmd1. null mutants of cmd1 are lethal; on the other
hand, cmd1 mutants specifically lacking all ca2+ binding
sites display normal viability during vegetative growth
(geiser et al., 1991; moser et al., 1996). analogous to the
fk506 and cyclosporin studies noted above, it has been
shown in c. albicans that calmodulin antagonists can act
synergistically in combination with azoles (krajewskakulak and niczyporuk, 1993; henry et al., 1999; marchetti
et al., 2000).
using s. cerevisiae as a model, we have pursued these
clues to investigate systematically the relationship of calcium signalling to azole and  xxxd3314xxx  activity. thus, we
studied the effects of: (i) ca2+ addition or chelation; (ii)
structurally distinct calmodulin and calcineurin inhibitors;
(iii) genetic lesions in calmodulin and calcineurin, along
with the calcineurin-activated transcription factor crz1p/
tcn1p (fig. 1; matheos et al., 1997; stathopoulos and
cyert, 1997); and (iv) genetically upregulated calcium signalling. finally, the effects of azole and  xxxd3314xxx  on the
expression of known calcium signalling targets was studied. the results indicate that calcium signalling modulates
azole and  xxxd3314xxx  activity.

azoles and is equally or more pronounced with other
inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis such as  xxxd3314xxx 
(ryder et al., 1998).
recent studies have provided potential clues as to the
mechanism(s) behind azole tolerance. the addition of
fk506 (tacrolimus) or cyclosporin greatly enhanced the
in vitro activity of azoles against selected c. albicans
strains (maesaki et al., 1998; marchetti et al., 2000). in
mammalian cells, fk506 and cyclosporin bind to the peptidyl prolyl isomerases fkbp and  xxxg798xxx , respectively,
and these complexes subsequently inhibit calcineurin and
suppress the immune response (liu et al., 1991). calcineurin is a protein phosphatase that is widely conserved
in eukaryotes, including the model yeast saccharomyces
cerevisiae, and a key component of calcium signalling
(fig. 1; for reviews, see hemenway and heitman, 1999;
aramburu et al., 2000; cyert, 2001). it is a heterodimer of
a catalytic subunit (encoded in s. cerevisiae by either
 xxxg1819xxx  or  xxxg1820xxx ) and a regulatory subunit (encoded by
 xxxg1820xxx ). null mutants in  xxxg1820xxx  or  xxxg1819xxx  and  xxxg1820xxx  are
viable, but result in hypersensitivity to mono- and divalent
ions and pheromone-induced growth arrest (nakamura
et al., 1993; breuder et al., 1994; mendoza et al., 1994;
garrett-engele et al., 1995).

like other azoles,  xxxd2640xxx  inhibits lanosterol demethylase in the sterol biosynthesis pathway (lees et al.,
1999).  xxxd2640xxx  had potent effects on s. cerevisiae
strain w303-1a, inhibiting growth by 50% (ic50) at
0.022 mg  xxxg1167xxx  and by nearly 100% at 0.031 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in a
typical 48 h assay (fig. 2). as an initial test of the hypothesis that calcium signalling modulates azole activity, the
effects of adding or removing ca2+ were examined. the
addition of cacl2 (3 mm) reduced  xxxd2640xxx  activity twofold (fig. 2a). conversely, the addition of the ca2+ chelator
egta (1 mm) enhanced  xxxd2640xxx  activity threefold. by
themselves, cacl2 and egta at the concentrations tested
had no effects on s. cerevisiae growth. similar effects of
cacl2 and egta on the activities of the structurally distinct
azoles itraconazole and ketoconazole were also observed
(data not shown; crowley et al., 1998).
the allylamine  xxxd3314xxx  targets an earlier enzyme
in the sterol biosynthesis pathway,  xxxg2197xxx 
(lees et al., 1999). in a 48 h assay, w303-1a growth
was strongly inhibited by  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations of
2 mg  xxxg1167xxx  or above (fig. 2b). as with  xxxd2640xxx , however,  xxxd3314xxx  activity was reduced twofold by the addition of cacl2 (3 mm) and enhanced twofold by the addition
of egta (1 mm).

fig. 2. microbroth dilution assays of  xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd3314xxx  or cycloheximide activity versus s. cerevisiae w303-1a in the presence of 3 mm
cacl2 (triangles) or 1 mm egta (circles); control with no added compound (crosses). absorbance was recorded after 48 h incubation.

as a comparison, the effects of cacl2 and egta on the
activity of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(ic50 = 0.06 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) were examined. in contrast to the
results presented above, the addition of cacl2 (3 mm) and
egta (1 mm) had no significant effect on cycloheximide
activity (fig. 2c).
finally, mncl2 (0.3 mm) was observed to have a similar
effect to egta, enhancing azole and  xxxd3314xxx  but not
cycloheximide activity (data not shown). this could result
from mn2+ acting as a competitive inhibitor of ca2+,
although other mechanisms are clearly possible.
calmodulin antagonists enhance azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity
the effects on azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity of cacl2 addition
or its depletion by egta could be mediated by the ca2+binding regulatory protein calmodulin. to test its role,
azole and  xxxd3314xxx  activities versus s. cerevisiae w3031a were examined in the presence of three structurally
distinct compounds known to inhibit mammalian cal-

modulin. at the concentrations tested, fluphenazine (3
or 6 mg  xxxg1167xxx ), calmidazolium (r24571; 3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) and j-8
(w-7 analogue; 6 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) had little or no inhibitory activity
of their own, but all enhanced the activities of  xxxd2640xxx ,
itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx  (table 1). the enhancement
varied from 1.6- to >11-fold.
as a comparison, the effects of one calmodulin antagonist on the activities of three drugs with mechanisms of
action other than sterol biosynthesis inhibition were examined. fluphenazine (3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) had minimal (£1.1-fold)
effects on the activities of the membrane-targeted  xxxd164xxx , the microtubule inhibitor  xxxd2745xxx  or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (table 1).
calcineurin inhibitors enhance azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity
a well-characterized target for ca2+-calmodulin activation
is calcineurin (fig. 1). the potential role of this phosphatase in modulating azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity was
examined using the calcineurin inhibitors fk506 (tacroli-

mus) and  xxxd1781xxx . these structurally distinct compounds bind to two different peptidyl prolyl isomerases
(fkbp and  xxxg798xxx  in mammalian cells, fkb1p and
cph1p in s. cerevisiae), and these complexes subsequently bind to calcineurin and block its activation.
fk506 (3 or 6 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) enhanced  xxxd2640xxx , itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx  activity versus w303-1a 2.2- to 3.3fold (table 1).  xxxd1781xxx  (3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) had little effect
after the standard incubation time (24–48 h), but a 1.4- to
2.1-fold enhancement of azole and  xxxd3314xxx  activity was
apparent after 66 h incubation (table 1). at a higher concentration (15 mg  xxxg1167xxx ), cyclosporin had an effect comparable to fk506 on the related strain yjn433 (see below.)
with respect to drugs with other mechanisms of action,
fk506 (3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) had variable effects.  xxxd2745xxx 
activity was unaffected by fk506 addition, amphotericin
b activity was reduced 1.9-fold, whereas cycloheximide
activity was enhanced twofold (table 1).
genetic lesions in calmodulin, calcineurin and crz1p
enhance azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity
although the above studies implicate calmodulin and calcineurin in the modulation of azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity, it is
possible that the signalling inhibitors used were not truly
specific for these protein targets. therefore, antifungal
activity was examined in two strains (yjn434 and
yjn435) in which three putative ca2+ binding sites of
calmodulin were modified by site-directed mutagenesis
(calmodulin is an essential protein and so null mutants
could not be tested), and strains in which the calcineurin

regulatory (yjn519) or catalytic (yjn520) subunits were
eliminated by gene disruption. on agar plates with appropriate concentrations of  xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd3314xxx  (fig. 3) or
itraconazole (not shown), these calmodulin and calcineurin mutant strains demonstrated increased sensitivity
relative to the parent strain (yjn433). conversely, no
consistent differences between strains were apparent
on plates with cycloheximide (fig. 3) or  xxxd2745xxx  (not
shown) at concentrations ranging from subinhibitory to
highly inhibitory. as noted previously (farcasanu et al.,
1995), calcineurin deletion also resulted in increased mn2+
sensitivity; the same was observed for the calmodulin
mutants (fig. 3). after submission of this manuscript,
bonilla et al. (2002) reported findings similar to those
above using  xxxd2640xxx  and an s. cerevisiae calmodulin
mutant.
the transcription factor crz1p/tcn1p has been identified as a target of the calcineurin phosphatase (matheos
et al., 1997; stathopoulos and cyert, 1997); dephosphorylation results in its translocation from cytoplasm to
nucleus (stathopoulos-gerontides et al., 1999) (fig. 1).
consistent with these studies, a crz1-deleted strain
(yjn522) was hypersensitive to mn2+ (fig. 3). as with the
calmodulin and calcineurin mutants above, on agar plates,
the crz1d strain displayed enhanced sensitivity to  xxxd2640xxx , itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx , but unaltered sensitivity to cycloheximide and  xxxd2745xxx  (fig. 3; data not
shown). similar results were obtained in strain by4743;
specifically, after 30 h incubation,  xxxd3314xxx  ic50s of 6.0
and 1.5 mg  xxxg1167xxx  were obtained for the parent and its crz1d
derivative respectively.

a. yjn433 strains were incubated for 48 h; by4743 strains were
incubated for 30 h.

in addition to calcineurin, ca2+-calmodulin activates the
protein kinases cmk1p and cmk2p (fig. 1). two different
cmk1 cmk2 double disruption strains were tested along
with their parent strains for altered sensitivity to itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx ; no differences were observed (not
shown).

constitutive activation of calcineurin and overexpression
of crz1 diminish azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity
as loss of calcineurin and crz1p enhanced azole/ xxxd3314xxx  sensitivity, then constitutive activation or overexpression of these proteins was predicted to decrease azole/
 xxxd3314xxx  sensitivity. a strain (yjn521) with a deletion in
the carboxy-terminal autorepressor domain of cna1p,
which leads to constitutive calcineurin phosphatase
activity (moser et al., 1996), was tested for its antifungal
sensitivity. as predicted, it demonstrated decreased
 xxxd2640xxx ,  xxxd3314xxx  and mn2+ sensitivity, but unaltered
cycloheximide and  xxxd2745xxx  sensitivity in agar plate
assays relative to the parent strain yjn433 (fig. 3; data
not shown).
as shown in fig. 4, overexpression of crz1 from a
 xxxg935xxx  promoter on a multicopy plasmid similarly resulted
in decreased  xxxd2640xxx  and  xxxd3314xxx  sensitivity.
furthermore, crz1 overexpression negated the enhancement of  xxxd3314xxx  activity by the addition of the
calcineurin inhibitor ascomycin (a close relative of fk506).
finally, this experiment also demonstrated that s. cerevisiae (with or without crz1-expressing plasmid) continued

fk506 effects on  xxxd3314xxx  activity are mediated by
calcineurin and fk506 binding protein
if the enhancement of azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity by fk506
and cyclosporin (see above) is mediated by calcineurin
inhibition as expected, then this enhancement should not
be apparent in calcineurin deletion strains. to test this, the
 xxxd3314xxx  plus fk506 experiment (table 1) was repeated
in strains yjn433, yjn519 and yjn520 (table 2). the
addition of fk506 (3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) reduced the  xxxd3314xxx  ic50
3.5-fold in yjn433, similar to previous results with w3031a. in the absence of functional calcineurin (strains
yjn519 and yjn520), fk506 reduced  xxxd3314xxx  ic50
only 1.4-fold. these results are consistent with expectations, although the residual effect of fk506 in the calcineurin mutants suggests that it can affect antifungal
sensitivity in ways other than calcineurin inhibition. equivalent results were obtained with cyclosporin (15 mg  xxxg1167xxx ;
data not shown).
calcineurin inhibition by fk506 and cyclosporin is
mediated by their binding proteins fkbp (encoded by
fpr1) and  xxxg798xxx . the ability of fk506 to enhance
 xxxd3314xxx  activity was compared in strain by4743 and
its fpr1d derivative (table 2). comparable ic50s were
obtained for the deletion and parent strains in the absence
of fk506, which was expected as fpr1p is not a component of ca2+ signalling. the addition of fk506 enhanced
 xxxd3314xxx  activity ninefold in by4743 but only 2.1-fold in
by4743fpr1d. the residual enhancing effect of fk506 in
the fpr1d mutant was eliminated by the use of a lower
fk506 concentration (0.3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ), which still enhanced
 xxxd3314xxx  activity 4.2-fold in the parent strain (table 2).

to grow slowly in the presence of these antifungals, e.g.
growth in 4 mg  xxxg1167xxx   xxxd3314xxx  was nearly undetectable at
65 h but clear at 90 h, and the number of colonies formed
approached 100% of those on the control plate. thus, the
growth was not caused by the selection of rare resistant
(suppressor) mutants.
azole/ xxxd3314xxx  treatment upregulates expression of
ca2+-responsive genes
if ca2+-regulated signalling modulates azole/ xxxd3314xxx 
activity, then treatment of cells with these drugs should be
associated with upregulation of genes normally upregulated by increased ca2+. there are likely to be many such
genes. we examined by rna hybridization the expression
of two genes shown previously to be ca2+ regulated: fks2
encoding one of two b-1,3-glucan synthases found in s.
cerevisiae, and  xxxg214xxx  encoding a golgi-localized ca2+/
mn2+ importer (mazur et al., 1995; matheos et al., 1997;
stathopoulos and cyert, 1997). as shown in fig. 5a,
 xxxd3180xxx  signal (rna loading control) initially increased as
the culture entered mid-log phase and then levelled off.
this increase was slightly reduced with cacl2 (10 mm)
treatment, but  xxxd2640xxx  (0.1 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) and  xxxd3314xxx 
(3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) treatment had a much greater effect on  xxxd3180xxx 
levels, especially by 8 h, consistent with their inhibition of
cell growth. (an equal number of cells from the untreated

(mico) or 3 mg  xxxg1167xxx   xxxd3314xxx  (terb). rna was
purified, slot-blotted to membranes and hybridized to the indicated gene probes. note that
approximately equal numbers of cells (2 ¥ 107)
from the untreated control culture were processed at each time point, and equivalent
volumes of the treated cultures were processed
similarly; thus, the drug-treated samples
contained fewer cells, especially by 8 h.
b. gene expression was quantified by densitometric scanning of the autorads above with
normalization to  xxxd3180xxx  levels, and the ratios of
expression in treated versus control cultures
were calculated and graphed.

control culture was processed at each time point, and
equivalent volumes of the treated cultures were processed regardless of cell number.) in the control culture,
expression of fks2 and  xxxg214xxx  decreased, relative to
 xxxd3180xxx , after 4 h and especially after 8 h. treatment with
cacl2 reversed this decrease. these effects are quantified
in fig. 5b, which shows, for example, that fks2 expression was 1.5- or 6.3-fold higher in cacl2-treated versus
control cultures after 4 or 8 h incubation respectively. as
predicted, treatment with  xxxd2640xxx  or  xxxd3314xxx  had
comparable or greater effects on fks2 and  xxxg214xxx  expression (fig. 5a and b). specifically, fks2 expression was
2.2- or 19-fold higher in  xxxd2640xxx -treated versus control cultures and 6.3- or 58-fold higher in terbinafinetreated versus control cultures after 4 or 8 h incubation
respectively.
expression of the multidrug transporter gene pdr5 provides an interesting comparison with fks2 and  xxxg214xxx . a
variety of drugs including azoles are known substrates for
the pdr5p transporter (kolaczkowski et al., 1998). treatment of cultures with several of these drugs has been
observed to upregulate pdr5 expression (hirata et al.,
1994; t. edlind, unpublished data). as shown in fig. 5,
pdr5 expression was unaffected by cacl2 but was upregulated by both  xxxd2640xxx  and  xxxd3314xxx ; e.g. 3.2- or
sevenfold, respectively, compared with control after 4 h
incubation.

pdr5p plays a minor role in the enhancement of
azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity by fk506
it was reported previously that fk506 enhanced the activity of the azole derivative ketoconazole against s. cerevisiae (egner et al., 1998). furthermore, certain mutations
in the multidrug transporter pdr5p increased or decreased
this ability of fk506 to enhance ketoconazole activity,
leading to the suggestion that the enhancement resulted
from direct inhibition of pdr5p by fk506 (egner et al.,
1998; 2000). as this mechanism is distinct from the mechanism we propose here, we tested a pdr5 deletion strain
to determine the role of this transporter under our experimental conditions (table 3). as expected, relative to its
parent, by4741pdr5d was hypersensitive to the five antifungals tested, although to variable extents (2.4- to 50-fold
after 30 h incubation). the addition of fk506 (1 mg  xxxg1167xxx )
enhanced the activity of  xxxd3314xxx  (4.0- and 3.4-fold at
30 h), itraconazole (3.0- and >2.2-fold) and  xxxd2640xxx 
(2.5- and 3.7-fold) comparably in both strains (by4741
and by4741pdr5d respectively). this indicates that pdr5p
is not required for the azole/ xxxd3314xxx -enhancing effects
of fk506. in contrast, fk506 at the same concentration
had little or no effect (1.1- and 0.80-fold) on ketoconazole
activity in either strain. only at a higher concentration
(3 mg  xxxg1167xxx ; data not shown) did fk506 enhance ketoconazole activity (2.2-fold), and only in by4741 not
by4741pdr5d; this is consistent with the previous reports
(egner et al., 1998; 2000).
these differences in fk506 activity can be correlated
with a second difference between ketoconazole and the
other antifungals: although by4741 exhibited substantial
tolerance (in terms of time-dependent increase in ic50)
to  xxxd3314xxx  (6.8-fold increase between 30 and 54 h),
itraconazole (14-fold increase) and  xxxd2640xxx  (3.1-fold
increase), it was not tolerant to ketoconazole (1.1-fold
increase; table 3). there was also minimal tolerance to a
fourth azole, fluconazole (1.8-fold increase). fk506
enhanced fluconazole activity versus by4741 only modestly (1.7-fold) and had no effect in the pdr5d strain. thus,
these results support the hypothesis that the primary
© 2002 blackwell publishing ltd, molecular microbiology, 46, 257–268

effect of fk506 is on azole/ xxxd3314xxx  tolerance mediated
by ca2+ signalling. however, azole derivatives vary in their
ability to induce (or repress) this tolerance and, in its
absence, a direct effect of fk506 on pdr5p function may
be observed.
discussion
clinically important candida species including c. albicans
display varying degrees of tolerance to the widely used
azole antifungals, inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis
(revankar et al., 1998; rex et al., 1998; marr et al., 1999).
we are using s. cerevisiae as a model to examine the
molecular basis for antifungal tolerance. this information
may prove useful in the development of improved antifungal therapies. previous studies in c. albicans with
calmodulin and calcineurin inhibitors (krajewska-kulak
and niczyporuk, 1993; maesaki et al., 1998; henry et al.,
1999; marchetti et al., 2000) led us to hypothesize that
ca2+-regulated signalling was involved in azole tolerance. the s. cerevisiae data presented here strongly
support this hypothesis and extend it to a second group
of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors represented by
 xxxd3314xxx .
model
the combined results of previous studies with specific
inhibitors and the present studies with specific inhibitors
and genetic lesions have to date identified three protein
components of azole/ xxxd3314xxx  tolerance: calmodulin,
calcineurin and the crz1p transcription factor. as shown
in fig. 1, we propose that cytoplasmic or organellar membrane perturbation resulting from inhibition of ergosterol
synthesis initiates ca2+-mediated azole/ xxxd3314xxx  tolerance. (other treatments that perturb normal membrane
structure or function might also activate this pathway.)
membrane perturbation leads to an influx of extracellular
ca2+ or its release from intracellular stores into the cytosol.
this promotes ca2+-calmodulin formation (prevented in
the cmd1-3 and cmd1-6 mutants in which ca2+ binding

264 t. edlind et al.
sites have been eliminated). ca2+-calmodulin specifically
binds to calcineurin (blocked by calmodulin antagonists or
calcineurin inhibitors). calcineurin is a phosphatase consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits (loss of either
by gene deletion reduced tolerance) and is normally
autorepressed. ca2+-calmodulin binding (or the specific
cna2d deletion of the autoregulatory domain) blocks this
autorepression, activating the phosphatase. one recently
characterized substrate of the calcineurin phosphatase is
the crz1p transcription factor (crz1 deletion reduced tolerance; multicopy expression increased tolerance). after
dephosphorylation, crz1p can enter the nucleus to activate the transcription of specific genes encoding, for
example, the glucan synthase fks2p and the vacuolar or
golgi ca2+ importers pmc1p or pmr1p respectively. the
gene target (or targets) directly responsible for azole/
 xxxd3314xxx  tolerance, and the mechanism by which it
elicits tolerance, will be examined in future studies.
putative components of s. cerevisiae calcium signalling
that have yet to be characterized are the cytoplasmic
and organellar membrane ca2+ transporters. mid1p and
cch1p are strong candidates (iida et al., 1994; fischer
et al., 1997; paidhungat and garrett, 1997), and we
have preliminary evidence of their involvement in azole/
 xxxd3314xxx  tolerance (unpublished data).

roles of pdr5p and other signalling pathways
fk506 was reported previously to enhance the inhibitory
activity of the azole ketoconazole versus s. cerevisiae
(egner et al., 1998; 2000). the proposed mechanism
involved direct inhibition of the multidrug efflux pump
pdr5p, which is known to transport azoles (kolaczkowski
et al., 1998), as a specific pdr5 mutation resulted in
loss of fk506–ketoconazole synergism. however, we
observed comparable fk506 enhancement of azoles
 xxxd2640xxx  and itraconazole (as well as  xxxd3314xxx ) activity in pdr5 wild-type and null strains. it appears that
this discrepancy results from varying degrees of tolerance
to different azoles: in our hands, s. cerevisiae displayed
little tolerance (growth at inhibitory concentrations after
longer incubation) to ketoconazole, but considerable
tolerance to  xxxd2640xxx , itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx .
enhancement of azole activity via direct inhibition of
pdr5p also appears to require a several-fold higher concentration of fk506 than enhancement via inhibition of
ca2+ signalling. in addition, direct inhibition of a multidrug
transporter was proposed to be the mechanism behind
the calcineurin- and  xxxg798xxx -independent synergism of
fk506–fluconazole combinations versus the basidiomycetous yeast cryptococcus neoformans (del poeta et al.,
2000).

‘cross-talk’ and redundancy between signal transduction pathways and their targets are not uncommon. for
example, the glucan synthase gene fks2 involved in cell
wall synthesis is a target for both calcium and cell integrity
(protein kinase c) signalling pathways (matheos et al.,
1997; stathopoulos and cyert, 1997; de nobel et al.,
2000). thus, it is not unlikely that multiple signalling pathways would contribute to antifungal tolerance. indeed,
initial studies indicate that the cell integrity pathway
also modulates azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity (t. edlind,
unpublished).
saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model
although s. cerevisiae clearly provides a useful model for
antifungal studies, it is important to note that the laboratory strains studied here and typical c. albicans clinical
isolates do not respond identically to the agents studied.
first of all, azole/ xxxd3314xxx  tolerance, defined as ‘trailing’
growth that leads to a substantial time-dependent
increase in mic, is more pronounced in c. albicans.
consequently, inhibition of calcium signalling had different
effects on azole/ xxxd3314xxx  activity versus these fungi.
in s. cerevisiae, the effects were largely in terms of
decreased ic50 or mic, whereas in c. albicans, a
decrease in trailing is more apparent (henry et al., 1999;
marchetti et al., 2000). a second difference between
s. cerevisiae and c. albicans involves fluconazole, the
most widely prescribed antifungal. s. cerevisiae was
relatively insensitive to fluconazole (mic = 8 mg  xxxg1167xxx )
compared with other azoles such as  xxxd2640xxx 
(mic = 0.03 mg  xxxg1167xxx ). this may explain why calcium signalling plays only a minor role in fluconazole activity versus s. cerevisiae, i.e. the addition of cacl2 or egta and
the presence of genetic lesions in calmodulin, calcineurin
or crz1 had little effect on fluconazole activity, as did the
addition of fluphenazine or fk506 (unpublished data). in
contrast, initial studies in c. albicans, which is about 10fold more sensitive to fluconazole, demonstrate that calcium signalling strongly modulates fluconazole activity in
that organism (henry et al., 1999; marchetti et al., 2000).
finally, although fk506 had potent effects on azole/
 xxxd3314xxx  activity in both s. cerevisiae and c. albicans,
the same was not true for cyclosporin, which had much
less of an effect on s. cerevisiae. although the basis for
this difference is unknown, it could result from cyclosporin
interaction with the  xxxg1812xxx  cpr3p
(matouschek et al., 1995) in addition to the cytosolic
cph1p involved in ca2+ signalling. in s. cerevisiae, mitochondrial defects have been shown to diminish azole sensitivity (hallstrom and moye-rowley, 2000; kontoyiannis,
2000), which would presumably offset the enhancing
effects resulting from inhibition of ca2+ signalling.

antifungal activity is modulated by calcium signalling 265
imidazoles as potential inhibitors of both calmodulin and
lanosterol demethylase
several imidazoles including  xxxd2640xxx  and  xxxd1732xxx 
have been shown to inhibit mammalian calmodulin in the
low micromolar range (hegemann et al., 1993; macneil
et al., 1993). indeed, one of the calmodulin antagonists
used here, calmidazolium (r24571), is chemically derived
from  xxxd2640xxx  (louis et al., 1983). this raises the
intriguing possibility that the relatively potent antifungal
activity of these imidazoles reflects both inhibition of
ergosterol biosynthesis and inhibition of calmodulinmediated tolerance. at least, this dual activity might
contribute to the long recognized fungicidal activity of
 xxxd2640xxx  and related imidazoles at high concentrations
(beggs, 1984).
conclusions
the calcium signalling pathway is highly conserved:
human and yeast homologues of calmodulin and calcineurin have 59% and 50% amino acid identity respectively. this implies that calcium signalling evolved to play
a basic function in eukaryotic cells. preservation of normal
membrane structure and function would qualify as such a
function. of course, the currently used antifungal inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis are evolutionarily recent
inventions. it may be that calcium signalling plays a normal regulatory role in membrane biogenesis and maintenance. if so, its role in protecting yeast from specific
antifungal inhibitors may be fortuitous. alternatively,
ergosterol biosynthesis may be a common target of environmental insults and stresses or of naturally occurring
inhibitors.
in any case, the observations presented here support
a previously unrecognized role for signal transduction as
a defence response to antifungal treatment. this response
is at present limited to inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis; it remains to be seen whether signalling pathways
modulate the activity of other antifungals, such as the
recently developed cell wall synthesis inhibitors. a practical implication of these findings is that specific inhibitors
of signal transduction could be clinically useful adjuvants
to conventional antifungals. although the calmodulin and
calcineurin inhibitors tested to date (e.g. fluphenazine and
fk506) do not have selective toxicity for fungi, it should
be possible to identify derivatives that are acceptable in
this respect.
finally, after submission of this manuscript cruz et al.
(2002) reported that fk506 and cyclosporin enhancement of azole activity versus c. albicans is mediated by
calcineurin. thus, our observations with s. cerevisiae
appear to have direct relevance to this opportunistic
pathogen.

experimental procedures
drugs and media
except where noted, all experiments were done in ypd
medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose,
ph 6.3). drugs were obtained from sigma, with the following
exceptions: itraconazole (janssen), fluconazole (pfizer),  xxxd3314xxx  (novartis), fenpropimorph (crescent chemical) and
fk506 (fujisawa). drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso; except fluconazole, which was provided in
saline); the final dmso concentration was £0.5% in all cases
and had no detectable effect on growth.

strains
saccharomyces cerevisiae strain w303-1a (mata  xxxg1661xxx  leu2
ura3 his3  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx  can1) was used, except where noted. calmodulin and calcineurin mutants were obtained from t. davis
(university of washington, seattle, wa, usa). the parent
strain is cry1 (moser et al., 1996; referred to here as
yjn433), which is derived from w303. the cmd1-3 mutant
(yjn434) has six substitutions in the first three ef-hand
calcium-binding domains (d20a, e31v, d56a, e67v, d93a,
e104v), whereas the cmd1-6 mutant (yjn435) has three
substitutions in the first three ef-hand calcium-binding
domains (d20a, d56a, d93a) (geiser et al., 1991). the
 xxxg1820xxx ::leu2 disruption strain (yjn519),  xxxg1819xxx ::leu2
 xxxg1820xxx ::ura3 double disruption (yjn520) and constitutively
activated calcineurin mutant cna2dc (yjn521) have been
described previously (moser et al., 1996).
a crz1 disruption (yjn522) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product-mediated recombination as described previously (longtine et al., 1998). the
forward primer included the 50 nucleotides immediately
upstream of the crz1 start codon, and the reverse primer
included 50 nucleotides complementary to nucleotides 985–
1034 of the coding sequence. the 20 nucleotides at the 3¢
end of each primer derived from the vector sequence immediately flanking the schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene
in plasmid pfa6a-his3mx6 (longtine et al., 1998), which
served as the pcr template. the pcr product was transformed into yjn433 by the lithium acetate method (ausubel
et al., 1997), and disruptants were selected on dob plates
with complete supplement mixture minus histidine (bio 101).
colonies were reisolated by streaking on fresh plates, and
crz1 disruption was confirmed by pcr using primers representing internal and flanking crz1 sequences and minipreps of genomic dna (prepared by suspending cells in
10 mm tris-hcl/1 mm edta, vortexing for 2 min with glass
beads, heating for 2 min in boiling water bath and microcentrifuging for 2 min).
to construct pjr1133-crz1, the crz1 coding region was
amplified from w303-1a dna (prepared as above) using the
primers
5¢-cagacggatccaggaagatgtcattcagca
(bamhi site and start codon underlined) and 5¢-aaaaagtc
gacaataattaactctcttgtcccga (sali site and complement of stop codon underlined). pjr1133 is a 2 mm shuttle
vector with ura3 and a  xxxg935xxx  promoter cloned upstream of
a multiple cloning site (obtained from c. beh, university of
california, berkeley, ca, usa). crz1 pcr product and

266 t. edlind et al.
pjr1133 were cleaved with bamh and sali, ligated and
transformed into escherichia coli dh5a by standard techniques (ausubel et al., 1997). after confirmation of its structure, pjr1133-crz1 was transformed into w303-1a with
selection on supplemented dob plates minus uridine.
diploid strain by4743 and homozygous deletion derivates
cnb1d, crz1d, fpr1d and pdr5d were obtained from resgen.
cry1 cmk1d cmk2d and yph499 cmk1d cmk2d strains
were obtained from t. davis and j. thorner (university of
california, berkeley, ca, usa) respectively.

drug sensitivity assays
drug sensitivities were assayed by microbroth dilution in 96well plates essentially as described previously (henry et al.,
2000). briefly, fresh overnight cultures were diluted in ypd to
1 ¥ 104 cells  xxxg1167xxx  and 100 ml aliquoted to wells, except for the
initial well, which received 200 ml. drug (1 ml of the appropriate stock in dmso) was added to the initial well. after mixing,
100 ml was removed to the second well, and this was
repeated for all but the final well, which served as a drug-free
control. after incubation at 30∞c for the indicated time periods, absorbance at 630 nm was determined in a microplate
reader. drug concentrations inhibiting growth to 50% of control levels (ic50) were estimated by extrapolation.
drug sensitivities were also assayed on ypd agar plates
containing drugs at the indicated concentrations. dmso, the
drug vehicle, was £0.5% in all cases. plates were spotted
with 3 ml of a fresh overnight culture diluted to ª 1 ¥ 105
cells  xxxg1167xxx , then incubated at 30∞c for the indicated times.

rna hybridization
log phase cultures (2 ml) were treated as indicated. rna
was prepared by acid–phenol extraction, slot-blotted to nylon
membrane and hybridized to 32p-labelled dna probes as
described previously (henry et al., 1999). comparable rna
preparations were shown to be free of dna contamination in
previous studies (henry et al., 1999; 2000). probes were
prepared from pcr products amplified from genomic dna
by standard techniques using the following primer pairs:
 xxxd3180xxx  (5¢-accgaagctccaatgaatccaaaatcc and 5¢gtttggtcaataccagcagcttccaaa); fks2 (5¢-gtcc
tacaacgatccaaacttg and 5¢-tccggggtaaatctga
cttgat);  xxxg214xxx  (5¢-aggtgacagaatccccgcaga and
5¢-gtcatgtggtttgaggttagtg); and pdr5 (5¢-atgc
ccgaggccaagcttaa and 5¢-ctgacgatgtcgttacca
act).
