leukemia and indolent b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma that
has progressed within 6 months of treatment with rituximab
or a rituximab-containing regimen. histone deacetylase
(hdac) inhibitors, when combined with a proteasome
inhibitor, can result in the excessive buildup of misfolded
proteins leading to apoptosis. both  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd2839xxx  have been studied for their activity with bortezomib in
multiple myeloma. currently, median survivals in patients
with myeloma are approaching 7–8 years. we can anticipate
breaking the 10-year barrier shortly.

partial responses (31%). survival was shorter for patients
with treatment-emergent extramedullary disease, median
16 months. this encouraging activity of  xxxd2984xxx  in
extramedullary disease would make its use in myelomatous
meningitis logical [9].  xxxd2984xxx  in patients who were
refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide enrolled
35 patients, each in cohorts receiving 2 and 4 mg daily. the
overall response rate was 49% (14% vgpr, 11% pr and 23%
mr) at 2 mg. in the 4 mg cohort, the overall response rate was
43%. overall survival at 6 months was 78 and 67%, respectively, in the 2 and 4 mg cohorts. myelosuppression was the
most common toxicity [10].
new drug development in multiple myeloma is proceeding at a rapid rate and offers hope for our patients.
in addition to  xxxd2984xxx ,  xxxd441xxx , a tetrapeptide
epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor, was approved by the
united states food and drug administration (fda) on
1 august for patients with myeloma who had received at
least two prior therapies, including both bortezomib and
thalidomide or lenalidomide. the anti-cs1 antibody  xxxd1980xxx  shows no single agent activity, but appears to be active
when combined with bortezomib or lenalidomide. oral
proteasome inhibitors are enrolling patients with myeloma.
 xxxd298xxx  is an agent being studied in myeloma, currently approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic
