ó springer international publishing switzerland 2015

abstract flibanserin (addyitm) is chemically described as
a benzimidazole and is being developed by sprout pharmaceuticals for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder
(hsdd). the drug has a high affinity for serotonin 5-ht1a and
5-ht2a receptors (5-ht1a agonist/5-ht2a antagonist) and is
believed to treat hsdd by increasing levels of dopamine and
noradrenaline and lowering levels of serotonin in the brain.
flibanserin has been approved in the usa for the treatment of
premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hsdd.
earlier phase iii development of the agent for hsdd in the eu
and canada had been discontinued by boehringer ingelheim,
following regulatory feedback. boehringer ingelheim had also
evaluated flibanserin for the treatment of depression but, due
to displaying very mild antidepressant activity, its development in this indication was discontinued. this article summarizes the milestones in the development of flibanserin
leading to its first approval for hsdd.

1 introduction
around one in ten women are thought to be affected by
hypoactive sexual desire disorder (hsdd), making it the
most common type of female sexual dysfunction [1, 2].
hsdd (once defined as an absence/deficiency of sexual
interest/desire, leading to significant distress and
this profile has been extracted and modified from the adisinsight
database. adisinsight tracks drug development worldwide through the
entire development process, from discovery, through pre-clinical and
clinical studies to market launch and beyond.

interpersonal difficulties [3]) is now considered by the
dsm-5 as a female sexual interest/arousal disorder,
requiring any three of the following criteria for diagnosis:
absent/decreased sexual interest, erotic thoughts/fantasies,
excitement/pleasure, initiation of sexual activity (or
responsiveness to partner’s attempts to initiate it), sexual
cue responses, and sensations during sexual activity [4].
in august 2015, flibanserin, under the tradename
addyitm, became the first medication approved in the usa
for the treatment of acquired, generalized hsdd in premenopausal women (dosage: 100 mg administered orally
once daily at bedtime) [5, 6]. after buying the rights for
flibanserin in 2011 from boehringer ingelheim [7] (who had
discontinued its development, following regulatory advice
that more data were necessary to support the drug’s
safety/efficacy in premenopausal women with hsdd [8]),
sprout pharmaceuticals resubmitted the new drug application (nda) for flibanserin in 2013, based primarily on a
study in over 1000 premenopausal women with hsdd [9].
the us fda issued a complete response letter, which was
subsequently appealed by sprout pharmaceuticals [10]. the
fda responded to the appeal in february 2014, requesting
additional clinical trials (including a driving simulation
study), and sprout pharmaceuticals resubmitted the nda
for flibanserin in february 2015 [11, 12]. to ensure safe use
of flibanserin, sprout pharmaceuticals (in consultation with
the fda) developed a comprehensive risk evaluation and
mitigation strategy (rems) programme, through which
availability of the drug is currently restricted [6, 13]. flibanserin is associated with an increased risk of severe
hypotension and syncope in certain settings [including in
combination with alcohol or strong or moderate inhibitors of
cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes, and in patients with
hepatic impairment]; the manufacturer’s prescribing information carries this information in a boxed warning [6].

2 scientific summary
2.1 pharmacodynamics
exactly how flibanserin may act to ameliorate hsdd in
premenopausal women has not yet been established [6].
flibanserin has a high affinity for serotonin 5-ht1a and
5-ht2a receptors, at which it displays agonist and antagonist activity respectively [6, 14], and may also be a
moderate antagonist of 5-ht2b,2c and dopamine d4
receptors [6]. the drug does not appear to activate presynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the human brain, suggesting
it may have brain region-specific effects [15].
flibanserin was shown to directly activate postsynaptic
serotonin inhibitory responses in the cerebral cortex [16],
antagonize postsynaptic 5-ht2a receptors in the medial
prefrontal cortex [17] and enhance tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the hippocampus [17] of rats.
agonism and antagonism of postsynaptic 5-ht1a of 5-ht2a
receptors by flibanserin could potentially lead to downstream alterations in neurotransmitter release that regulate

reward processing [18]. these neurotransmitter changes
may include increases in dopamine and norepinephrine and
reductions in serotonin [18], as has been seen with flibanserin in some instances in the brains of rats, in regions
such as the prefrontal cortex [19, 20] and hypothalamic
medial preoptic area [20]. indeed, in other rat studies, flibanserin appeared to modulate serotonergic and dopaminergic activity in distinct areas of the brain [21], preferentially
activating regions involved in dopaminergic reward (particularly the ventral tegmental area) and the integration of
sexual cues (i.e. certain hypothalamic structures) [22].
flibanserin increased some sexual-related behaviours
and social interactions between marmoset male and female
pairmates [23] and showed some promise in alleviating
sexual dysfunction in women with major depressive disorder in one of four phase iib trials designed to evaluate
depression (post hoc analysis) [24].

chemical strucure of flibanserin

flibanserin: first global approval

in a thorough qt study, flibanserin was not associated
with clinically relevant qt interval prolongation in healthy
volunteers when administered at a dosage either equivalent
to (50 mg twice daily), or three-times higher than (100 mg
thrice daily), the recommended dosage of 100 mg once
daily [6]. mean increases in heart rate of 1.7–3.2 beats/min
were seen with flibanserin 100 mg thrice daily relative to
placebo in this study [6].
2.2 pharmacokinetics
in healthy premenopausal women who received a single
dose of oral flibanserin 100 mg, the maximum plasma
concentration of the drug (cmax 419 ng/ml) was reached
after a median of 0.75 h and its area under the plasma
concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity
(auc?) was 1543 ngh/ml [6]. the cmax of flibanserin is
proportional to dose following oral administration of single
doses of 100–250 mg; however, compared to a single dose,
exposure to flibanserin is 1.4-fold higher following oncedaily administration of flibanserin 100 mg [6].
flibanserin reaches steady state after 3 days’ administration and has an absolute oral bioavailability of 33 % [6].
administering flibanserin in a fed rather than a fasted state
increased the extent to which flibanserin was absorbed
(auc? up to 1.56-fold and cmax up to 1.15-fold), but
slowed the absorption rate (median time to cmax 0.9–1.8
vs. 0.8 h) [6]. in a population model based on data from
healthy volunteers, there appeared to be little delay
between flibanserin cmax being reached and drowsiness
occurring [25].
flibanserin is highly (&98 %) bound to proteins
(predominantly albumin) in serum [6]. flibanserin
undergoes extensive metabolism primarily via cyp3a4,
with cyp2c19 contributing to a lesser extent; there
appears to be minimal involvement of cyp1a2,
 xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg586xxx , cyp2c9 or cyp2d6. at least 35
flibanserin metabolites are produced, most of which are
present in plasma at low concentrations; only two
metabolites achieve a plasma concentration similar to that
of the parent drug, although neither are pharmacologically
active. elimination of flibanserin was via the faeces
(51 %) and urine (44 %) following a single oral 50 mg
dose of flibanserin solution. the mean terminal half-life
of flibanserin is &11 h [6].
hepatic impairment increases systemic exposure to flibanserin [e.g. 4.5-fold if the hepatic impairment is mild
(child pugh score 6)], which may increase the likelihood of
hypotension, syncope and cns depression occurring; thus,
flibanserin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic
impairment [6]. exposure to the drug is also increased in
poor cyp2c19 metabolizers (auc? by 30 % vs.

extensive cyp2c19 metabolizers), necessitating increased
monitoring for hypotension and other adverse events (aes)
in individuals with poor cyp2c19 metabolism. flibanserin
exposure is likewise increased in poor cyp2d6 metabolizers (auc by 18 % vs. extensive, intermediate or ultrarapid cyp2d6 metabolizers), but decreased in poor
cyp2c9 metabolizers (auc? by 18 % vs. extensive
metabolizers) [6].
renal impairment may increase flibanserin exposure
slightly, with the auc? of the drug being 1.1- and 1.2-fold
higher in patients with mild-to-moderate or severe renal
impairment relative to healthy controls [6]. similarly,
exposure to flibanserin was &1.4-fold higher in japanese
than caucasian women, although this difference appeared
to be due to bodyweight rather than race. how age may
affect flibanserin exposure has not been formally studied;
flibanserin is not indicated for use in paediatric or geriatric
patients [6].
2.2.1 potential drug interactions
flibanserin is contraindicated for use in combination with
moderate or strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice), as the
resultant increase in flibanserin concentrations may
increase the risk of syncope and hypotension [6]. flibanserin should be discontinued c2 days prior to initiating
such cyp3a4 inhibitors and be reinitiated 2 weeks after
cyp inhibitor discontinuation [6]. clinically relevant
increases in flibanserin exposure (and thus risk of adverse
reactions) may also occur if flibanserin is coadministered
with multiple weak inhibitors of cyp3a4 (e.g. cimetidine,
fluoxetine, oral contraceptives, ranitidine, resveratrol,
gingko) or with strong cyp2c19 inhibitors (e.g. benzodiazepines, antifungals, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris),  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors) [6].
drugs that are inducers of cyp3a4 (e.g. rifampicin,
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, etravirine) may
reduce flibanserin exposure; coadministration is not recommended [6].
flibanserin may affect the pharmacokinetics of some
drugs upon coadministration. for instance, flibanserin has
been shown to increase exposure to digoxin (a p-glycoprotein substrate), simvastatin (a cyp3a4 substrate) and
 xxxd2054xxx  by 2.0-, 1.5- and 1.09-fold, respectively,
and decrease exposure to levonorgestrel and the active
metabolite of bupropion (a  xxxg583xxx  substrate) by 1.06-fold
and 9 % [6]. taking flibanserin in combination with
alcohol does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic
profile of flibanserin, although does increase the risk of
cns depression, hypotension and syncope; alcohol is
therefore contraindicated [6].

2.3 therapeutic trials
2.3.1 premenopausal women with hsdd
this section focuses on phase iii trials (collectively known
as the bouquet studies) assessing the efficacy of flibanserin in premenopausal women with hsdd.
treatment for 24 weeks with flibanserin, at dosages of
50 mg once daily at bedtime or 25 or 50 mg twice daily,
did not significantly improve sexual desire relative to placebo in premenopausal women with hsdd, as assessed by
mean changes from baseline in the coprimary efficacy
measures of electronic diary (ediary) desire scores (7.0, 8.8
and 7.7 vs. 7.5) or number of satisfying sexual events
(sses) (1.6, 1.5 and 1.6 vs. 1.6), in a phase iii trial [26].
this randomized, double-blind trial, known as dahlia
(nct00360243), included 1434 north american patients.
in a similarly designed phase iii study (daisy), flibanserin 100 mg once daily at bedtime, but not 50 or
25 mg twice daily, significantly (p \ 0.01) increased the
monthly number of sses compared with placebo over
24 weeks in premenopausal women with hsdd (mean
changes from baseline were 1.9, 1.4 and 1.4 vs. 1.1),
although none of the dosages significantly improved
monthly sexual desire measured by ediary score (mean
changes from baseline were 8.5, 8.8 and 7.9 vs. 6.8 with
placebo) (coprimary endpoints) [27]. however, each flibanserin dosage significantly (p \ 0.05 vs. placebo)
improved sexual desire and function [as measured by the
female sexual function index (fsfi) desire domain score
and total score], as well as the distress associated with
sexual dysfunction [as measured by the female sexual
distress scale-revised (fsds-r) total score and item 13
score]. this trial (nct00360555) included 1584 randomized north american patients.

similar benefits were observed with flibanserin in this
setting in a smaller phase iii study known as violet
(nct00360529) [28]. relative to placebo, flibanserin 50 or
100 mg once daily at bedtime significantly (p \ 0.05)
improved the number of sses (mean changes from baseline were 1.4 and 1.6 vs. 0.8 with placebo), but not sexual
desire measured by ediary score (mean changes from
baseline were 8.2 and 9.1 vs. 6.9) over 24 weeks of therapy
(coprimary endpoints). however, other measures of sexual
desire (fsfi desire domain scores), as well as overall
sexual function (fsfi total score), were significantly
(p \ 0.05 vs. placebo) improved with each of the flibanserin dosages. flibanserin 100 mg, but not 50 mg, once
daily also significantly (p \ 0.001) reduced the distress
associated with sexual dysfunction and low sexual desire
(measured by the total score and item 13 score of the
fsds-r) [28]. this study was of double-blind design and
randomized 880 north american premenopausal women
with hsdd.
the findings of violet and daisy were subsequently
supported by another 24-week phase iii trial, begonia
(nct00996164) [29]. by the end of this study, flibanserin
100 mg once daily at bedtime had significantly (p \ 0.001
vs. placebo) improved both the sse number (adjusted
mean changes from baseline were 2.5 vs. 1.5 with placebo)
and the sexual desire (adjusted mean changes from baseline
in fsfi desire domain score were 1.0 vs. 0.7) experienced
over 4 weeks by premenopausal women with hsdd (coprimary endpoints). the drug was also associated with
significant (p \ 0.001 vs. placebo) improvements in overall sexual function (fsfi total score), sexual distress
(fsds-r total score) and distress associated with low
sexual desire (fsds-r item 13 score). 1090 north american women were randomized in this double-blind trial
[29].

flibanserin: first global approval

in a 24-week trial in european premenopausal women
with hsdd (orchid; nct00491829), flibanserin 50 or
100 mg once daily at bedtime provided no significant
benefit over placebo in terms of sse number (mean
changes from baseline to study end were 1.2 and 1.5 vs.
0.9) (primary endpoint) [30]. however, the women who
received the 100 mg/day dosage did experience significant
(p \ 0.05) improvements in sexual desire (when measured
by ediary, but not by fsfi desire domain score), sexual
distress (fsds-r total score) and distress associated with
low sexual desire (fsds-r item 13 score), but not overall
sexual function (fsfi total score); by contrast, flibanserin
50 mg/day was not associated with significant improvements in these parameters. this study was of randomized,
double-blind design and included 945 women.
longer-term data for flibanserin in premenopausal
women with hsdd are currently available from two
studies, known as rose (nct00277914) [31] and
sunflower (nct00441558) [32]. in rose [31],
women who had responded to flibanserin during a
24-week open-label flexible-dose period continued to
experience benefit with flibanserin at a stable optimized
dosage in a subsequent 24-week double-blind, placebocontrolled period. at the end of this double-blind phase,
flibanserin recipients had significantly (p \ 0.05) smaller
reductions in monthly sse number (mean change from
randomization baseline of -1.4 vs. -2.3) and ediary
sexual desire score (mean change from randomization
baseline of -4.9 vs. -8.2) than placebo recipients (coprimary endpoints). the drug was also associated with
smaller (p \ 0.05) increases in sexual dysfunction-related
distress (fsds-r total score and item 13 score) and
smaller (p \ 0.01) declines in sexual desire (fsfi desire
domain score) and sexual function (fsfi total score) than
placebo. of the 738 women in the open-label period
(flibanserin 50 mg once daily at bedtime for 4 weeks
then, if needed, titrated to 100 mg once daily at bedtime
or 50 mg twice daily over the next 12 weeks), 333
achieved a prespecified response and were subsequently
randomized to receive double-blind therapy [31].
these findings are generally supported by those of
sunflower, which was a 52-week open-label extension
of five trials (violet, daisy, dahlia, rose and a
phase ii pharmacokinetic study) and was primarily

designed to investigate safety [32]. during the extension,
premenopausal women with hsdd experienced improvements in measures of sexual function and distress, including fsfi total score (24.4 %) and fsds-r total score
(27.6 %). moreover, most women (90 %) who were free
from clinical sexual dysfunction (as per fsfi score) when
entering sunflower remained as such at the end of the
study, and 42 % of women with clinical sexual dysfunction
at the sunflower baseline were also free from clinical
sexual dysfunction at this timepoint [32]. a total of 1725
women entered the study and the flibanserin dosage was
flexible (50 or 100 mg once daily at bedtime or 25 or
50 mg twice daily).
2.3.2 postmenopausal women with hsdd
in a 24-week phase iii trial known as snowdrop
(nct00996372), flibanserin 100 mg once daily at bedtime
significantly (p b 0.004) increased sse number (mean
change from baseline of 1.0 vs. 0.6) and sexual desire
(mean change from baseline in fsfi desire domain score of
0.7 vs. 0.4) relative to placebo in naturally postmenopausal
women with hsdd [33]. in addition to these coprimary
endpoints, flibanserin significantly (p \ 0.01) improved
overall sexual function (fsfi total score), sexual distress
(fsds-r total score) and distress related to low sexual
desire (fsds-r item 13 score). a total of 949 women were
randomized in this double-blind study [33].
2.3.3 other studies
the benefits of flibanserin as a hsdd treatment have also
been demonstrated in an open-label extension study
(nct01103362) conducted in both premenopausal
(n = 346) and postmenopausal (n = 249) women [34]. in
this 28-week trial (which was an extension of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; one in
premenopausal women and two in postmenopausal
women), flibanserin 100 mg once daily at bedtime was
associated with consistent reductions in distress associated
with sexual dysfunction and low sexual desire (as measured
by fsds-r total and item 13 scores) as well as increases in
sexual function and desire (as measured by fsfi total score
and desire domain score) [34].

2.4 adverse events
treatment with flibanserin (50 or 100 mg/day) for
24–28 weeks had a generally acceptable tolerability profile
in premenopausal women with hsdd in phase iii studies
[27–29], including magnolia (nct00601367), a flexible-dose, open-label study designed to assess safety [35].
among the 480 women in magnolia, 69 % had aes
(primary outcome), 43 % had drug-related aes and 1.9 %
had serious aes [35].
in a pooled analysis (n = 3099) of four randomized,
double-blind trials of 24 weeks’ duration conducted in this
population, the aes that occurred most often with flibanserin 100 mg once daily at bedtime (i.e. the recommended dosage) and with an incidence c2 % greater than
placebo were dizziness (11.4 vs. 2.2 %), somnolence (11.2
vs. 2.9 %), nausea (10.4 vs. 3.9 %) and fatigue (9.2 vs.
5.5 %) [6]. twice as many flibanserin than placebo recipients discontinued treatment because of aes (13 vs. 6 %),
most commonly dizziness, nausea, insomnia, somnolence
and anxiety (1–1.7 vs. 0.1–0.3 %) [6].
some of the symptoms that occur with flibanserin,
including somnolence, sedation and fatigue, are due to
cns depression, the risk of which is greater if the drug is
taken during waking hours or in conjunction with other
cns depressants (including alcohol) or drugs that many
increase concentrations of flibanserin [6]. hypotension and
syncope can also occur with flibanserin, although the
incidence of these aes was low with the drug in premenopausal women with hsdd in a pooled analysis of five
randomized, double-blind trials (0.2 and 0.4 vs. \0.1 and

0.2 % with placebo); the risk of these events is increased
by taking flibanserin either during waking hours, at a
higher than recommended dosage or in combination with
alcohol or strong/moderate inhibitors of cyp3a4 [6].
it is recommended that activities requiring full alertness
(e.g. driving) are avoided for c6 h after taking flibanserin
[6]. however, when next-day residual effects of the drug
were assessed in healthy premenopausal women, flibanserin 100 mg once daily at bedtime did not impair
cognitive function or driving performance relative to placebo, 9 h after acute or chronic dosing [36]. this was a
preliminary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in which 72 women
completed 57,600 km (cumulative total) of simulated
driving.
taking flibanserin in combination with ssris or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors did not appear to
alter the tolerability profile of flibanserin in 114 premenopausal women with mild/remitted depression in a
randomized, placebo-controlled study [37]. this study had
a 12-week treatment period (during which the flibanserin
dosage was 100 mg once daily at bedtime or 50 mg once
daily at bedtime for 2 weeks uptitrated to 100 mg once
daily at bedtime) and a 1-week post-treatment assessment.
according to longer-term phase iii trials of up to
52 weeks duration [31, 32], the tolerability profile of flibanserin (50 or 100 mg/day) in premenopausal women was
generally similar to that seen in shorter-term studies.
during the 52-week extension study known as sunflower [32], the predefined primary endpoint aes of
somnolence (overall incidence 15.8 %), fatigue (7.6 %),

flibanserin: first global approval

dizziness (6.9 %), nausea (6.3 %), sedation (1.6 %) and
vomiting (1.4 %) were generally mild or moderate in
severity. with the exception of vomiting, these aes were
the most frequent aes considered to be related to flibanserin; no serious aes were considered related to the
drug [32]. likewise, no safety concerns were raised in the
rose trial [31], with the most common aes being somnolence (14.1 %) and fatigue (10.3 %) during the 24-week
open-label flexible-dose phase and nasopharyngitis, upper
respiratory tract infection, headache, urinary tract infection
and sinusitis during the subsequent 24-week double-blind
period (5–13 % of flibanserin recipients vs. 4–11 % of
placebo recipients).
the tolerability profile of flibanserin in postmenopausal
women with hsdd was consistent with that in premenopausal women, according to data from the 24-week
phase iii snowdrop study [33]. most aes in the flibanserin and placebo groups were mild or moderate, the
most common of which were dizziness (9.9 vs. 3.1 %),
somnolence (8.8 vs. 1.5 %), nausea (7.5 vs. 3.5 %) and
