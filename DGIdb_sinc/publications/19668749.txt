abstract:  xxxd367xxx  is a white powder commercially formulated as a 1% ophthalmic
suspension to reduce intraocular pressure (iop). pharmacologically,  xxxd367xxx  is a highly
speciﬁc, non-competitive, reversible, and effective inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx  ( xxxg293xxx ),
able to suppress formation of aqueous humor in the eye and thus to decrease iop. several clinical
trials have evaluated its safety and the most commonly ocular adverse events are blurred vision
(3%–8%), ocular discomfort (1.8%–5.9%), and eye pain (0.7%–4.0%).  xxxd367xxx  has been
introduced to treat ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma. in some clinical
studies it has been estimated that  xxxd367xxx  reduced iop by was about 18%.  xxxd367xxx 
can be added to beta-blockers and prostaglandins. in the latter combination, because prostaglandin derivatives improve the uveoscleral outﬂow but also increase the activity of ca in
ciliary epithelium with a secondary increase in aqueous humor secretion, and slightly reduce the
efﬁcacy of prostaglandin analogues, theoretically topical ca inhibitors (cai) decrease iop by
inhibiting  xxxg293xxx , thus improving prostaglandin efﬁcacy as well as lowering iop.  xxxd367xxx 
could have a secondary possible effect on ocular ﬂow too. some clinical studies showed a mild
improvement of ocular blood ﬂow. theoretically, cai could give rise to metabolic acidosis, with
secondary vasodilatation and improvement of blood ﬂow. systemic acidosis can occur in the
setting of oral cai therapy, and local acidosis within ocular tissues is theoretically possible with
topical cai therapy, with the potential for a local increase in ocular blood ﬂow. in conclusion,
topical cai treatment has efﬁcacy in iop-lowering ranging from 15% to 20%. from published
data,  xxxd367xxx  can be used as ﬁrst-line medication, even if other medications have a higher
efﬁcacy, with few side effects and it is a good adjunctive treatment. in some type of glaucoma
patients with a vascular dysregulation, topical cai could have a double effect: reducing iop
and improving ocular blood ﬂow.

 xxxd367xxx  is a white powder insoluble in water, commercially formulated as a 1%
ophthalmic suspension to reduce intraocular pressure (iop).  xxxd367xxx  empirical
formula is  xxxd367xxx  (figure 1) with a melting point of approximately 131°c
(cvetkvic and perry 2003; shoji 2007). the commercially available preparation of
 xxxd367xxx  is  xxxd367xxx ® (alcon laboratories, inc, ft. worth, texas, usa), with a
ph of approximately 7.5 and osmolarity of 300 mosm/kg (cvetkvic and perry 2003;
shoji 2007; iester 2008).
the efficacy of  xxxd367xxx  0.3%–3% bid has been evaluated in several
randomized double-blind, multicenter comparative clinical trials (march and ochsner
2000; sall 2000; shin 2000, 2000; silver 1998, 2000; michaud and friren 2001).
a dose-response study comparing  xxxd367xxx  in concentrations of 0.3%, 1%, 2%, and

3% demonstrated mean iop reductions of 3 mmhg (11.3%),
4.3 mmhg (16.1%), 4.4 mmhg (16.1%), and 4.2 mmhg
(15.4%), respectively. when diurnal iop was measured,
 xxxd367xxx  1% or 3% reduced iop signiﬁcantly better than
 xxxd367xxx  0.3% (silver 2000).
these observations suggested that the optimal therapeutic
concentration for iop reduction was 1%. its recommended
dosing frequency is 3 times daily in the us and twice daily
in the eu and japan. however, 3 phase iii trials have
reported that  xxxd367xxx  1% bid and tid produced statistically signiﬁcant iop reductions from baseline, and that both
treatments were clinically equivalent to one another (silver
1998; march and ochsner 2000; shin 2000).
pharmacologically,  xxxd367xxx  is a highly speciﬁc, noncompetitive, reversible, and effective inhibitor of carbonic
anhydrase ii ( xxxg293xxx ) (desantis 2000), able to suppress formation of aqueous humor in the eye and thus decrease iop. it can
catalyze the reversible reaction of water and carbon dioxide
(co2) to form negatively charged bicarbonate ions (maren
1967). to achieve pharmacological effects, the near total
inhibition of ca is required (maren 1967; kaur et al 2002).
 xxxd367xxx  is cleared from the aqueous humor and cornea
with half-lives of approximately 3 and 5 hours respectively.
therefore, the cornea acts as a reservoir, providing sustained
release of the drug to the ciliary processes of the ciliary body
long after topical dosing (maren 1967; kaur et al 2002). in
human tissues there are 7 different isoenzymatic forms. the
most active isoenzymatic form is  xxxg293xxx , which is found mainly
in the erythrocytes, followed by kidneys, pancreas, eyes, central
nervous system, and lungs (maren 1967). in the eye, the enzyme
is expressed mainly in the ciliary processes of the ciliary body,
the corneal endothelial cells, and the pigment epithelium.
in the corneal endothelium  xxxg293xxx  plays a role in the
pumping mechanism, which helps to maintain the relatively
dehydrated state of the corneal stroma. inhibition of this mechanism may lead to the development of corneal decompensation
and edema, with secondary impaired vision.

in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 372
glaucomatous and ocular hypertension (oh) patients
received  xxxd367xxx  1% or  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%. after 18 months
of treatment, no signiﬁcant change was found in corneal
thickness and corneal endothelium cell density (march and
ochsner 2000). however, in this study only subjects with
healthy corneas were included. some concern remained in
patients with compromised corneas, because in 2 published
case reports corneal decompensation has been described in
patients with keratopathy after treatment with  xxxd1931xxx 
(adamson 1999; konowal et al 1999).
after topical ocular administration systemic absorption
of  xxxd367xxx  has been demonstrated in the tissues
of healthy volunteers (desantis 2000). topically instilled
 xxxd367xxx  enters the blood circulation binding preferentially to ca in the erythrocytes leaving the concentration of
free  xxxd367xxx  in plasma below the quantiﬁcation level.
in the  xxxd187xxx  less than 1% of  xxxg293xxx  activity is required to
maintain physiological function (march and ochsner 2000).
thus in the erythrocytes the concentration of ca inhibitors
(cai) was insufﬁcient to produce complete saturation of
ca. in the kidney, free  xxxd367xxx  is not sufﬁcient to
inhibit in the proximal convoluted tubules and luminal ca;
therefore systemic metabolic acidosis should not be obtained
(see below). furthermore, the low afﬁnity of  xxxd367xxx  for
the other ca isoforms and the low blood concentration may
explain the low incidence of systemic adverse effects after
topical administration (march and ochsner 2000).
several clinical trials (zeyen and caprioli 1993; silver
1998; sall 2000; shin 2000; wang et al 2004; zhao and chen
2005; menon and vernon 2006) have evaluated the safety
of  xxxd367xxx  1% ophthalmic suspension. the most commonly ocular adverse events were blurred vision (3%–8%),
ocular discomfort (1.8%–5.9%), and eye pain (0.7%–4.0%).
other ocular adverse events occurring at an incidence of less
than 3% included hyperemia, pruritus, tearing, discharge,
blepharitis, keratitis, foreign body sensation, dry eye,
conjunctivitis, and lid margin crusting.
zhau and chen (2005) have reported two cases of corneal
decompensation after 15 months and 2 years of  xxxd367xxx 
therapy. corneal edema reversed with discontinuation of the
treatment; however, the reason was difﬁcult to assess, and
neither patient was rechallenged after recovery. no change
in central corneal thickness was found (wang et al 2004).
the most common systemic adverse event was taste
perversion, occurring in 3.0%–7.8% of patients (silver 1998;
sall 2000; shin 2000). there were no clinically signiﬁcant
changes from baseline in heart rate and blood pressure,

clinical ophthalmology 2008:2(3)

 xxxd367xxx  in poag and oh patients

and in laboratory values for hematology, blood chemistry,
or urinalysis variables. in addition, mean total carbonic
anhydrase activity in red blood cells was reduced by only
51%–55%. however, one case of systemic metabolic acidosis
has been described by menon and vernon (2006).
 xxxd367xxx  has been introduced to treat oh and
primary open-angle glaucoma (poag), which are probably
two different aspects of the same disease in which iop is too
high for the optic nerve head (onh) structure.
glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their
axons. clinically, the glaucomatous optic nerve manifests
progressive enlargement of the optic cup, with commensurate
progressive thinning of the neuroretinal rim and visual ﬁeld
defects. however, it is possible to lose up to 35% of optic
nerve axons before the ﬁrst visual ﬁeld defect is detectable
using standard automated perimetry (pederson and anderson
1980; zeyen and caprioli 1993).
oh is characterized by an increase of iop without any
visual ﬁeld, onh, and retinal nerve ﬁbre layer changes
(european glaucoma society 2003). in other words oh
can be a ﬁrst step forward the glaucoma in most patients,
but not all oh patients will change to glaucoma. indeed,
in the ocular hypertension treatment study (ohts), it was
found that after a follow-up of 5 or 7 years some oh subjects
changed to glaucoma even if patients were treated or not
(van der walk et al 2005). obviously the percentage was
different and in particular among the oh patients treated
with topical hypotonic medication about 5% changed to
glaucoma, while in the other group which did not receive
any medication the percentage change was 9% (kass et al
2002). however, it is still not clear when and which oh
patients need to be treated.
both in poag and oh patients, the main risk factor for progression is an elevated iop which can cause
damage to the onh and then to the visual ﬁeld. some
clinical trials have shown that decreasing the iop can be
useful for slowing down glaucoma progression (cntgs
1998; agis investigators 2000; kass et al 2001; heijl
et al 2002; leske et al 2007), and iop has been the only
treatable risk factor until now (european glaucoma
society 2003). thus the treatment of glaucoma focuses
on the reduction of iop with drugs, lasers, or surgery.
over the past few years, there has been a gradual shift
in the choice of ﬁrst-line medical therapy. six different
classes of iop-lowering molecules are currently available, including alpha adrenergic agonists, beta-blockers,
cai, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandin analogues,

clinical ophthalmology 2008:2(3)

and sympathomimetics. the efﬁcacy differs among these
classes, ranging from about 30% for the prostaglandins/
prostamides to about 18% for the topical cai (european
glaucoma society 2003).
clinically, all types of iop-lowering medications can
be used as the ﬁrst choice, as european glaucoma society
guidelines suggest. if the ﬁrst-chosen medication alone does
not control glaucoma, adjunctive therapy in the form of
other topical agents can be added to the therapeutic regimen.
however, when the first choice is not effective and/or
tolerated in any individual patient, any of the other topical
agents can be substituted as monotherapy.
when choosing the medical treatment for glaucoma, it
is important to understand not only the aims of therapy, but
also the mode of action, side effects, and contraindications
of each individual medication (european glaucoma society
2003). many antiglaucoma drugs are available, and the
choice of therapy must take into account quality of life, cost,
and compliance. if more than two topical medications are
required to control the iop, other forms of therapy, such as
laser trabeculoplasty, or surgery, should be considered.
the reduction of iop can differ based on the iop baseline; however, the cntgs showed that the reduction should
be at least 30% to slow glaucoma progression (cntgs
1998). in contrast the agis investigators showed that in the
group of patients that maintained iop at around 12 mmhg in
all examinations during the 7-year follow-up, visual ﬁeld did
not progress (reis et al 2006). leske et al (2007) evaluated
separately patients with higher and lower baseline iop to
determine progression factors at the end of the early manifest
glaucoma trial (emgt) based on all emgt patients.
patients with early open-angle glaucoma were randomized
to argon laser trabeculoplasty plus betaxolol or no immediate treatment, and examined every 3 months for up to 11
years. treatment and follow-up continued to have a marked
inﬂuence on iop progression, regardless of baseline iop.
other signiﬁcant factors were age, bilaterality, exfoliation,
and disc hemorrhages. lower systolic perfusion pressure,
lower systolic blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease
history emerged as new predictors, suggesting a vascular
role in glaucoma progression. a new risk factor was a thinner central corneal thickness (leske et al 2007), but its role
is still under debate as a confounding factor.
also the ohts showed that topical ocular hypotensive
medication is effective in delaying or preventing the onset
of poag in individuals with elevated iop (oh) and no
evidence of glaucomatous damage (european glaucoma
society 2003).

these data show that iop reduction is fundamental in
poag and oh to delay the onset or prevent the onset of
poag in oh or the progression of the damage in poag.
 xxxd367xxx  can be used alone or in combination with other
medication to treat these patients.
the main ocular effect of  xxxd367xxx  is on iop: in the
ciliary epithelium, the inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  slows the formation of bicarbonate ions and their secretion into the posterior
chamber of the eye. this reduces the sodium transport into the
posterior chamber and decreases aqueous humor production,
resulting in lower iop (maren 1967). interestingly, ca is a
highly efﬁcient enzyme, and it has been estimated that more
than 99% of ca activity must be inhibited in order to suppress aqueous production to lower iop measurably (maren
1967). the efﬁcacy of  xxxd367xxx  1% and  xxxd1931xxx 
2% was compared in 25 normal subjects:  xxxd367xxx 
reduced daytime aqueous ﬂow by 0.47 mul/min and night-time
aqueous ﬂow by 0.16 mul/min, while  xxxd1931xxx  reduced
aqueous ﬂow by 0.34 mul/min and by 0.10 mul/min, respectively. however, the relative reductions of aqueous ﬂow
achieved by  xxxd367xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  were similar for
both medications (ingram and brubaker 1999).

in monotherapy
in a meta-analysis, van der valk et al (2005) estimated the
iop reduction achieved by the most frequently prescribed
glaucoma drugs and a placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials: they found that the highest reduction of
iop achieved by  xxxd367xxx  was of 17%.
wang et al (2004) conducted a small, prospective,
double-masked study comparing  xxxd367xxx  1% bid with
 xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid in 50 patients with open-angle glaucoma.
after 6 weeks of treatment, iop dropped 4.8 mmhg (17%)
in  xxxd367xxx -treated eyes and 5.7 mmhg (19.7%) in
 xxxd3377xxx -treated eyes (p ⬎ 0.05).

adjunctive to beta-blocker
shin (2000) compared the efﬁcacy of  xxxd367xxx  1% (tid)
and  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% (bid) to  xxxd3377xxx  0.5 (bid) and placebo (tid)
in patients with open-angle glaucoma or oh. after 1 month
of  xxxd3377xxx , patients added either  xxxd367xxx  or placebo for
3 months; mean iop reductions after the addition of  xxxd367xxx  to  xxxd3377xxx  ranged from 3.3 to 4.1 mmhg (statistically
signiﬁcant compared with both baseline and placebo).

adjunctive to prostaglandin
as we well know, prostaglandin derivatives improve uveoscleral outﬂow, but they also increase the activity of ca

520

in ciliary epithelium with a secondary increase in aqueous
humor secretion (martinez-de-la-casa et al 2004), causing
a slight reduction in the efﬁcacy of prostaglandin analogues.
theoretically, topical cai decrease iop by inhibiting  xxxg293xxx 
(desantis 2000), thus improving prostaglandin efﬁcacy as
well as reducing iop.
clinically in all adjunctive studies, a signiﬁcant reduction
of iop was observed. shoji et al (2005) added  xxxd367xxx 
to once-daily  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% in a small (n = 14), uncontrolled, open-label study of poag. mean iop signiﬁcantly
(p ⬍ 0.01) decreased by 20%, 21.1%, and 23.5% after 1, 2,
and 3 months of treatment, respectively. also in patients
with normal-tension glaucoma, nakamoto and yasuda
(2007) compared the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2446xxx  alone in one eye
with  xxxd2446xxx  plus  xxxd367xxx  in the fellow eye. mean
diurnal (p ⬍ 0.001) and nocturnal (p ⬍ 0.05) iop and the
mean circadian iop reduction from washout (p ⬍ 0.01) were
signiﬁcantly reduced more in the  xxxd367xxx  adjunct group
(17.1%) than the  xxxd2446xxx  monotherapy group (13.6%).
in a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel
group comparison study, franks et al (2006) compared
the effect of  xxxd367xxx  1% bid or  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid
when added to  xxxd3414xxx . after 3 months, no signiﬁcant
(p = 0.96) difference in the iop reduction was found
between groups. hollo et al (2006) found that patients
receiving combined  xxxd3414xxx  ophthalmic solution 0.004%
and  xxxd367xxx  ophthalmic suspension 1% therapy had
lower iop values than those on  xxxd3414xxx  monotherapy
(p ⬍ 0.0001). combined therapy resulted in a signiﬁcantly
greater percentage of patients achieving iop of 18 mmhg
or less (p ⬍ 0.0001).
feldman et al (2007) compared the efﬁcacy of  xxxd367xxx 
1% bid with brimonidine 0.15% bid when added to  xxxd3414xxx  once daily: after 3 months of treatment, a reduction
of 2.7 mmhg was found in the  xxxd367xxx  group and of
2.1 mmhg in the brimonidine group (signiﬁcant, p = 0.035).
reis et al (2006) compared the additive efﬁcacies of
 xxxd367xxx  1%, brimonidine 0.2%, or  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%, each
dosed twice daily, when added to  xxxd3414xxx  0.004% once
daily. mean adjunctive iop reduction seen with  xxxd367xxx  (4.2 mmhg, 22.7%) was statistically equivalent to
that seen with  xxxd3377xxx  (3.9 mmhg, 20.2%) (p ⬎ 0.05) and
both were signiﬁcantly (p ⬍ 0.02) greater than that seen with
brimonidine (2.3 mmhg, 13.4%).
martinez-de-la-casa et al (2004) compared the ioplowering efﬁcacy of concomitant therapy with  xxxd3414xxx 
once daily and  xxxd367xxx  twice daily versus once-daily
dosing of the  xxxd2446xxx / xxxd3377xxx  ﬁxed combination. mean

clinical ophthalmology 2008:2(3)

 xxxd367xxx  in poag and oh patients

diurnal iop was lower in the  xxxd3414xxx  plus  xxxd367xxx 
group than in the  xxxd2446xxx / xxxd3377xxx  group at 1 month
(p = 0.041), 2 months (p = 0.046), and 3 months (p = 0.015).
the iop differences ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 mmhg.
however, there is some published evidence that the
pathophysiology of glaucoma is multifactorial, and that
impaired blood ﬂow has a role in the disease process (leske
et al 1995; tielsch et al 1995; bonomi et al 2000; quigley
et al 2001). low diastolic perfusion pressure has been linked
to a higher incidence of glaucoma in a population-based
study. furthermore, disc hemorrhage has been identiﬁed as a
risk factor for disease progression in several studies (budenz
et al 2006; leske et al 2003). also, conditions related
to vasospasm are sometimes found in patients with
glaucoma, especially in normal-tension glaucoma. vascular
dysregulation could be one of the most important prognostic
factors for following some patients. the inconstant onh
perfusion could activate the astroglia to produce some
molecules that normally they do not produce or produce in
low levels (grieshaber et al 2007).
as schulzer and drance (1987) showed, the use of
the magic number of 21 mmhg to divide normal-tension
glaucoma ( xxxd2741xxx ) from high-tension glaucoma (htg) is not
sufﬁcient: indeed they found that other risk factors could
be useful to divide poag subgroups. similar results using
a different approach were obtained by nicolela and drance
(1996) who reviewed about 1000 onh slides of glaucomatous patients to divide them into 4 glaucomatous subgroups:
focal ischemic glaucoma, senile glaucoma, myopic glaucoma, and concentric excavation glaucoma. they selected
about 100 pure aspect optic discs that were included in one
of these four subgroups. finally, they checked the clinical
features of each subgroup and found signiﬁcant differences
in iop values, vasospatic symptoms, and visual ﬁeld defects,
suggesting that iop was still an important risk factor to
treat, but other factors were involved in the pathogenesis
of the disease.
 xxxd367xxx  could have a secondary possible effect on
ocular ﬂow. sampaolesi et al (2001) compared the onh
circulation in healthy eyes, oh, and glaucoma eyes and
found that blood ﬂow was decreased in oh and glaucoma
eyes compared with normal ones.  xxxd367xxx  restored
onh blood ﬂow to normal levels in oh eyes, but it did not
change with  xxxd367xxx  therapy, most probably due to the
loss of connective tissue.
however, kothy and hollo (2001) investigated the
potential in vivo inﬂuence of different topical glaucoma
medications on the diameter of retinal arterioles of healthy

clinical ophthalmology 2008:2(3)

volunteers and glaucoma patients through the use of a retinal
vessel analyzer (rva, imedos gmbh, weimar, germany)
and found no significant changes in arteriole diameter
at 2 hours after instillation of the topical antiglaucoma
drugs (ie,  xxxd367xxx  1%,  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%, betaxolol 0.5%,
brimonidine 0.2%,  xxxd2446xxx  0.005%).
siesky et al (2006) reported that eyes with poag, treated
with  xxxd367xxx , beneﬁted from higher diastolic perfusion
pressures than eyes treated with  xxxd1931xxx . thirteen subjects were enrolled in a masked crossover study consisting of
3 months of therapy with each drug. there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in iop, heart rate, mean arterial
pressure, or systolic blood pressure, but diastolic perfusion
pressure was higher in left eyes (although comparable in
right eyes) of subjects treated with  xxxd367xxx  versus
 xxxd1931xxx .
using the heidelberg retina flowmeter in a prospective
study on 20 glaucomatous patients, iester (2003) found that
after  xxxd367xxx  treatment a 19% decrease in iop was
obtained and a concomitant improvement of the retinal blood
ﬂow was obtained at the superior and inferior peripapillary
area. the improvement of the retinal blood ﬂow ranged from
13.15 % to 16.6%. in 30 normal human volunteers, kaup
et al (2004) found that eyes treated with  xxxd367xxx  had
no measurable changes in retrobulbar hemodynamic by color
doppler, but did show a signiﬁcantly reduced arteriovenous
passage time compared with placebo, as determined by video
ﬂuorescein angiogram.
theoretically, cai could give rise to metabolic acidosis,
with secondary vasodilatation and improvement of blood ﬂow.
systemic acidosis can occur in the setting of oral cai therapy,
and local acidosis within ocular tissues is theoretically possible
with topical cai therapy, with the potential for a local increase
in ocular blood ﬂow (kaur et al 2002). topical and systemic
cai have been shown to improve parameters related to ocular
blood ﬂow (harris et al 1996, 1999; barnes et al 2000). in
particular, because systemic cai also results in altered co2
clearance and ph levels (sponsel and shipman 1997), an
increase in tissue pco2 might promote local vasodilatation.
furthermore, several authors found that acetazolamide is
capable of increasing cerebral blood ﬂow in a dose-dependent
manner, which was attributed to extracellular acidiﬁcation
(severinghaus and cotev 1968; hauge et al 1983; volstrup
et al 1984; faraci et al 1987; ringelstein et al 1992).
even if local cais accumulate inside the red blood cells
because of their high afﬁnity for some proteins of  xxxd187xxx  and
plasma (harris et al 1996; costa et al 2003), it has been shown
that topical cai did not affect the retrobulbar hemodynamic

521

iester

parameters, while they enhanced the retinal blood ﬂow velocity
indices, improved retinal blood flow, and increased the
capillary velocity in the superﬁcial vessels of the onh.
several studies have shown blood flow or blood
velocity differences between normal healthy subjects and
glaucomatous ones (galassi et al 1992; gherghel et al
2000); and epidemiological studies have disclosed an
increased risk for glaucoma when ocular perfusion was
low (tielsch et al 1995; bonomi et al 2000). therefore,
the secondary vasoactive effect of  xxxd367xxx  could
be useful in glaucoma since evidence is growing that in
some glaucoma patients vascular dysregulation and lower
perfusion pressure are important risk factors (harris et al
1996, 1999; carlsson et al 2000).
in conclusion, topical cai treatment has an efﬁcacy in
iop-lowering that ranges from 15% to 20%. published data
show that  xxxd367xxx  can be used as ﬁrst-line medication,
even if other medications have a higher efﬁcacy, with few
side effects, and that it is a good adjunctive treatment. in
those patients in which iop must be reduced more than 30%,
 xxxd367xxx  can be combined with either prostaglandin analogues or with beta-blockers. in the near future new formulations with  xxxd367xxx  will be on the market. in particular
it will be combined with a beta-blocker or a prostaglandin
analogue. in the former ﬁxed combination, both molecules
work to decrease iop by suppressing the production of aqueous humor, but in the latter the target of the two medications
to decrease iop is different. in particular, topical cai should
be able to inhibit the activity of ca in the ciliary epithelium
which the prostaglandins tend to increase (shoji et al 2005;
nakamoto and franks 2006; yasuda 2007).
in some types of glaucoma patients with a vascular dysregulation, topical cai could have a double effect: to reduce
the iop and to improve the ocular blood ﬂow. however, it is
still controversial whether topical cai can improve ocular
blood ﬂow, and we have to consider the possibility that the
improvement of the ocular ﬂow could be also be due to
simply iop reduction. even if some clinical studies showed
that  xxxd367xxx  could improve blood ﬂow, no long-term
trial has been performed to answer this question.
