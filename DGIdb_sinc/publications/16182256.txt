clozapine and haloperidol differentially alter
the constitutive activity of central serotonin2c
receptors in vivo
sylvia navailles, philippe de deurwaerdère, and umberto spampinato
background: central serotonin2c (5-ht2c) receptors are known to play a role in the mechanism of action of the antipsychotic drugs
(apds) clozapine and haloperidol. however, evidence for the involvement of the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors in the
dopamine (da)ergic effects of apds is lacking in vivo.
methods: using in vivo microdialysis in halothane-anesthetized rats, we assessed the ability of selective 5-ht2c compounds to
modulate the release of da induced by haloperidol and clozapine in the nucleus accumbens and striatum.
results: both apds induced a dose-dependent increase in accumbal and striatal da extracellular levels. the effect of .01 mg/kg
haloperidol was potentiated by the 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  sb 206553 (5 mg/kg) but unaltered by the 5-ht2c antagonists sb 243213
and sb 242084 (1 mg/kg). conversely, the effect of 1 mg/kg clozapine, a dose able to reverse the decrease in da outflow induced by
the 5-ht2c agonist ro 60-0175 (3 mg/kg), was unaffected by sb 206553 but blocked by sb 243213 (1 mg/kg) and sb 242084 (.3 and
1 mg/kg).
conclusions: these results show that clozapine and haloperidol differentially alter the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors and
suggest that clozapine behaves as a 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  in vivo.

he serotonin2c (5-ht2c) receptor, a member of the gprotein coupled receptors superfamily (hoyer et al 2002),
is widely expressed within the central nervous system
(pazos et al 1985), where it is thought to play a major role in the
regulation of neuronal network excitability (tecott et al 1995).
central 5-ht2c receptors are known to exert tonic and phasic
inhibitory control on mesencephalic dopamine (da) neuronal
activity in vivo (gobert et al 2000; grottick et al 2000; navailles
et al 2004), and numerous studies have proposed the use of
5-ht2c antagonists for improved treatments of disorders associated with a dysfunction of da neurons (di giovanni et al 2002;
jones and blackburn 2002). recently, the constitutive activity of
5-ht2c receptors has been demonstrated to be a new form of
heteroregulation of da neuron activity in vivo (de deurwaerdère et al 2004). however, this property of the  xxxg1115xxx 
has not yet been taken into consideration in evaluating the
mechanism of action of therapeutic drugs in vivo.
the 5-ht2c receptors are known to play a role in the daergic
effects of antipsychotic drugs (apds) (meltzer et al 2003; wood et al
2001). most atypical apds, like clozapine, show high affinity for
5-ht2c receptors (roth et al 1992). specifically, evidence suggests
that clozapine may behave as a 5-ht2c antagonist in vivo. indeed,
clozapine reverses the inhibition of accumbal da release induced
by the 5-ht2c agonist ro 60-0175 (di matteo et al 2002) and blocks
the hypolocomotion induced by the 5-ht2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) (prinssen et al 2000). it is noteworthy that
clozapine, like several apds, behaves as a 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  in

heterologous expression systems in vitro (herrick-davies et al 2000;
rauser et al 2001). although this pharmacological profile is also
compatible with the above reported effects of clozapine, evidence
for the involvement of 5-ht2c inverse agonism in clozapine’s effects
is lacking in vivo.
the 5-ht2c receptors may also participate in the daergic effects
of the typical apd haloperidol. indeed, it has been reported that the
increase in striatal da release induced by haloperidol is dramatically
potentiated by the purported 5-ht2c antagonist sb 206553 (lucas et
al 2000). however, the recent finding that sb 206553 behaves as a
5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  in vivo (de deurwaerdère et al 2004) raises
the possibility that the potentiating effect reported above is not
strictly related to the simple blockade of 5-ht2c receptors by sb
206553. altogether, these findings suggest that the constitutive
activity of 5-ht2c receptors may participate in the 5-ht2c receptordependent modulation of clozapine- and haloperidol-stimulated
da release, an effect that, as mentioned above, is currently attributed to the blockade of the action of endogenous 5-ht at 5-ht2c
receptors.
thus, the present study was designed to determine whether the
constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors participates in the daergic
effects of apds in vivo. for this purpose, we assessed the influence
of the 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  sb 206553 (de deurwaerdère et al
2004), the well-known neutral 5-ht2c antagonist sb 242084 (de
deurwaerdère et al 2004), and the recently available neutral 5-ht2c
antagonist sb 243213 (shilliam and dawson 2005; navailles, unpublished results, 2005) on clozapine- and haloperidol-induced da
release. experiments were performed using in vivo microdialysis in
halothane-anesthetized rats, an experimental procedure permitting
simultaneous monitoring of da outflow in the ipsilateral nucleus
accumbens (nac) and striatum, to evaluate possible differences in
the  xxxg1115xxx  control of the mesoaccumbal and the nigrostriatal da pathways (de deurwaerdère and spampinato 2001; di
matteo et al 2001).

constant room temperature (21°c ⫾ 2°c) and relative humidity
(60%) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle (dark from 8:00 pm) and
had free access to water and food. all animals use procedures
conformed to international european ethical standards (86/609eec) and the french national committee (décret 87/848) for the
care and use of laboratory animals. all efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals
used.
drugs
the following compounds were used: ro 60-0175.hcl (s-2(6-chloro-5-fluoroindol-1-yl)-1- xxxd2612xxx .hydrochloride) kindly donated by dr. p. weber (f hoffmann-la roche,
basel, switzerland); sb 243213 (5-methyl-1-[[2-[(2-methyl-3pyridyl)oxy]-5-pyridyl]carbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline)
generously provided by dr. m. wood (psychiatry cedd, glaxosmithkline, harlow, united kingdom); sb 242084.2hcl (6chloro-5-methyl-1-[6-(2-methylpiridin-3-yloxy)pyridin-3-yl

(sigma-rbi, saint quentin fallavier, france); and haloperidol
(4-[4-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidino]-4’-fluorobutyrophenone) as the commercially available solution (haldol 5
mg/ml) (janssen pharmaceutica, beerse, belgium). all other
chemicals and reagents were the purest commercially available (vwr, strasbourg, france; sigma, illkirch, france).
microdialysis
surgery and perfusion procedures were performed as previously described (de deurwaerdère et al 2004), with minor
modifications. briefly, rats were anesthetized with a mixture of
halothane and nitrous oxide-oxygen (2%; 2:1 vol/vol). after
tracheotomy for artificial ventilation, the animals were placed in
a stereotaxic frame, and their rectal temperature was monitored
and maintained at 37.3°c ⫾ .1°c with a heating pad. two
microdialysis probes, 2 and 4 mm long (cma/11, 240 ␮m outer
diameter, cuprophan) (carnegie medicin, phymep, paris,
france) were implanted simultaneously using a dual probe
holder (carnegie medicin, phymep) in the right nac and striatum
(coordinates from interaural point: anteroposterior [ap] ⫽ 11,
lateral [l] ⫽ 1.3, ventral [v] ⫽ 2; and ap ⫽ 9.8, l ⫽ 3.3, v ⫽ 2.7,
respectively) according to the atlas of paxinos and watson
(1986). probes were perfused at a constant flow rate of 2 ␮l/min
by means of a microperfusion pump (cma 111, carnegie medicin, phymep) with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) containing
(in mmol/l): 154.1 cl-, 147 na⫹, 2.7 k⫹, 1 mg2⫹, and 1.2 ca2⫹,
adjusted to ph 7.4 with 2 mmol/l sodium phosphate buffer.
dialysates (30 ␮l) were collected on ice every 15 minutes. the in
vitro recoveries of the probes were about 10% for da. at the end
of each experiment, the brain was removed and fixed in sodium
chloride (nacl) (.9%)/paraformaldehyde solution (10%). the
location of the probes was determined histologically on serial
coronal sections (60 ␮m) stained with cresyl violet, and only data
obtained from rats with correctly implanted probes were included in the results.
chromatographic analysis
dialysate samples were immediately analyzed by reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) coupled
with electrochemical detection, as previously described (bonhomme et al 1995). the mobile phase (containing [in mmol/l] 70

sodium dihydrogen phosphate (nah2po4), .1 disodium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (na2edta), .7 triethylamine, and .1
octylsulfonic acid plus 10% methanol, adjusted to ph 4.8 with
ortophosphoric acid) was delivered at 1 ml/min flow rate
(system lc-10ad-vp, shimadzu, champs sur marne, france)
through a hypersyl column (c18; 4.6 ⫻ 150 mm, particle size 5
␮m) (touzard & matignon, paris, france). detection of da was
carried out with a coulometric detector (coulochem ii, esa,
paris, france) coupled to a dual-electrode analytical cell (model
5014, esa). the potential of the electrodes was set at -175 and
⫹175 mv. output signals were recorded on a computer (system
class vp-4, shimadzu france). under these conditions, the
sensitivity for da was .5 ␳g/30 ␮l with a signal/noise ratio of 3:1.
pharmacological treatments
pharmacological treatments were performed after the stabilization of da levels in the perfusate. a stable baseline, defined as
three consecutive samples in which da contents varied by less
than 10% in both structures, was generally obtained 135 minutes
after the beginning of the perfusion (stabilization period).
clozapine, diluted in a 99:1 vol/vol mixture of apyrogenic
water and lactic acid, was administered subcutaneously at .3, 1,
or 3 mg/kg in a volume of 2 ml/kg. haloperidol, diluted in nacl
.9%, was administered subcutaneously at .01 or .1 mg/kg in a
volume of 1 ml/kg. the 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  sb 206553 was
diluted in a 99:1 vol/vol mixture of apyrogenic water and lactic
acid; the selective 5-ht2c antagonists sb 243213 and sb 242084
were dissolved in a mixture of nacl .9% containing hydroxypropyl␤-cyclodextrin (8% by weight) plus  xxxd1710xxx  (25 mmol/l). sb
206553 (5 mg/kg), sb 243213 (1 mg/kg), and sb 242084 (.3 and
1 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneal (ip) in a volume of 2
ml/kg, 15 minutes (sb 206553 and sb 242084) or 30 minutes (sb
243213) before apds or appropriate vehicles. the 5-ht2c agonist ro 60-0175 was dissolved in nacl .9% and administered
intraperitoneally at 3 mg/kg in a volume of 1 ml/kg, 30 minutes
before 1 mg/kg clozapine or appropriate vehicle. the doses of
the different 5-ht compounds used were chosen on the basis of
previous studies to keep both selectivity and efficiency toward
the targeted sites (de deurwaerdère et al 2004; kennett et al
1996, 1997). also, the administration time of 5-ht agents was
chosen on the basis of their pharmacokinetic properties such that
they were at their pharmacodynamic maximums when the effect
of apds on da release was maximal (de deurwaerdère et al
2004; navailles, unpublished results, 2005). all drug doses were
calculated as the free base. in each experimental group, animals
received either drugs or their appropriate vehicle.
statistical analysis
dopamine contents in each sample were expressed as the
percentage of the average baseline level calculated from the
three fractions preceding any treatment. data correspond to the
mean ⫾ sem values of the percentage obtained in each experimental group. drug overall effect was calculated as the average
of da content from dialysates collected after their administration.
the statistical analysis of the effect of the apds haloperidol and
clozapine on basal da outflow was assessed by a one-way
analysis of variance (anova) (using group as the main factor)
with time as repeated measures, performed for the eight samples
that followed drug administration. when significant (p ⬍ .05), the
one-way anova was followed by the fisher’s protected least
significance difference test (plsd) to allow adequate multiple
comparisons between groups. the interaction between 5-ht2c
compounds and apds was studied by a two-way anova

performed for the eight samples that followed the apds administration. thereafter, a one-way anova (using group as the main
factor) followed by the post hoc fisher’s plsd test was performed to allow adequate multiple comparisons between groups
or, when the two-way anova was not significant (p ⬎ .05), to
determine the own effect of apds and 5-ht2c compounds in our
experimental conditions. finally, for each experiment, statistical
differences in basal da values among groups were assessed by a
one-way anova (using group as a main factor).

and sb 206553/vehicle (⫹35%) groups (p ⬍ .001 versus the
vehicle/haloperidol group, fisher’s plsd test). the increase in
da outflow elicited by sb 206553 reached statistical significance
in both brain regions (p ⬍ .001, fischer’s plsd test). to verify
that the ability of sb 206553 to potentiate haloperidol-stimulated
da release is dependent on the dose of haloperidol (lucas et al
2000), the effect of sb 206553 was also assessed in the presence
of .1 mg/kg haloperidol. the increase in da outflow induced by
.1 mg/kg haloperidol was not significantly affected by sb 206553
in both the nac [two-way anova, f (1,19) ⫽ .0002, ns] and the
striatum [two-way anova, f (1,19) ⫽ 1.1, ns] (data not shown).
conversely to sb 206553, the increase in accumbal and striatal
da extracellular levels induced by .01 mg/kg haloperidol was
not significantly affected by sb 243213 [two-way anova,
f (1,23) ⫽ .1 and f (1,23) ⫽ .04 for the nac and the striatum,
respectively, ns; figure 5 right panels]. sb 243213 per se exhibits
a trend toward increase in da efflux in both regions reaching
about 125% and 115% of baseline at the end of the experimental
period in the nac and the striatum, respectively (ns, fischer’s
plsd test). similarly, sb 242084 failed to affect .01 mg/kg
haloperidol-induced da efflux [two-way anova, f (1,20) ⫽ .56
and f (1,20) ⫽ 1.2 for the nac and the striatum, respectively, ns].
the increase in da outflow elicited by sb 242084 reached

da- xxxg656xxx  occupancy (schotte et al 1996) and a significant
increase in da release in both the nac and the striatum
(navailles et al 2004; rollema et al 2000).
the major finding of this study is that clozapine may modulate
subcortical da release by acting as an  xxxd1422xxx  at 5-ht2c
receptors in vivo. indeed, 1 mg/kg clozapine-stimulated da
release was blocked (dose dependent) by the 5-ht2c antagonist
sb 242084. a similar significant blockade of clozapine-stimulated
da release was also observed in the presence of the new 5-ht2c
antagonist sb 243213 (shilliam and dawson 2005). as in the case
of clozapine, the increase in da release induced by the 5-ht2c
 xxxd1422xxx  sb 206553 is blocked by the 5-ht2c antagonists
sb 242084 (de deurwaerdère et al 2004) and sb 243213 (navailles, unpublished results, 2005). as anticipated from its inverse
agonist profile (lefkowitz et al 1993), we showed that clozapine,
while blocking the inhibitory effect of the 5-ht2c agonist ro
60-0175 on da release, had no significant influence on the
increase in da release induced by the 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  sb
206553. these findings, arguing against the previous proposal
that clozapine behaves as a simple 5-ht2c antagonist in vivo (di
matteo et al 2002; prinssen et al 2000), point out that clozapine,
in agreement with its high affinity for 5-ht2c receptors in vitro
(8.1 nm) (roth et al 1992) and with its ability to reduce the basal
formation of inositol phosphate in cells expressing 5-ht2c
receptors (herrick-davies et al 2000; rauser et al 2001), enhances
subcortical da release by acting as an  xxxd1422xxx  at 5-ht2c
receptors to silence their level of constitutive activity in vivo.

discussion
the present study shows that the apds clozapine and haloperidol differentially alter the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c
receptors in vivo. the obtained results also provide the first in
vivo evidence that clozapine may modulate subcortical da
release by acting as a 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx .
a critical step when assessing the influence of 5-ht2c agents
on apd-stimulated da release is to determine the doses of apds
to be administered. indeed, it is known that the degree of central
da- xxxg656xxx  blockade is a limiting factor for the expression of
the  xxxg1115xxx -dependent control of da release (kapur and
remington 1996; lucas et al 2000). optimal doses of apds were
chosen on the basis of dose-response experiments showing that
.01 mg/kg haloperidol and 1 mg/kg clozapine elicit 5% to 10%

among all biogenic amine receptors targeted by clozapine,
our results supplement the knowledge of the 5-ht mechanisms
involved in the increase in da extracellular levels elicited by
clozapine at the dose used (kapur and remington 1996; meltzer
et al 2003). indeed, several studies have claimed that the
serotonin1a (5-ht1a) agonist and the serotonin2a (5-ht2a)/5ht2c antagonist components of clozapine account for the increase in cortical da extracellular levels (ichikawa et al 2001;
millan et al 1998; rollema et al 2000). however, 5-ht1a and
5-ht2a mechanisms have been discarded in subcortical areas
(ichikawa and meltzer 2000; kuroki et al 1999; liégeois et al
2002; lucas et al 2000; rollema et al 2000). furthermore, previous
studies have shown that da-d2 receptors, although occupied by
clozapine (schotte et al 1996), may not be primarily involved in
the da effects of low-dose clozapine (lidsky and banerjee 1992;
masson et al 2003). taken together, these data strengthen our
findings showing that it is mainly 5-ht2c receptors that are
involved in 1 mg/kg clozapine-induced increase in da extracellular levels in the nac and the striatum.
another important finding of this study is that the 5-ht2c
 xxxd1422xxx  sb 206553 and the 5-ht2c antagonists sb 243213
and sb 242084 exert different effects on haloperidol-stimulated
da release. the increase in da release induced by .01 mg/kg
haloperidol in both the nac and the striatum was dramatically
potentiated by sb 206553 but unaffected by sb 243213 and sb
242084. furthermore, in support of a functional potentiation by
sb 206553, it is noteworthy that the increase in da outflow
induced by higher doses of haloperidol, however, is not affected
by sb 206553 (lucas et al 2000; data not shown). as the doses of
5-ht2c antagonists used are known to be effective within the
central nervous system (de deurwaerdère et al 2004; kennett et
al 1997; navailles, unpublished results, 2005), these results
indicate that the potentiating effect of sb 206553 on haloperidolinduced da release is not based on the blockade of the
endogenous 5-ht effect at 5-ht2c receptors. more likely, considering the pharmacological properties of the 5-ht2c compounds used, the observed interaction relies on the ability of sb
206553 to silence the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors in
vivo (de deurwaerdère et al 2004). these findings indicate that
the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors is involved in the
effect of haloperidol on da release. although the mechanisms
underlying this interaction remain unknown, the potentiating
action of sb 206553 on haloperidol-induced da release suggests
that the typical apd haloperidol, despite its absence of affinity
for 5-ht2c receptors (schotte et al 1996), increases the level of
their constitutive activity. in line with this possibility, it has been
shown that an acute treatment with haloperidol, without affecting 5-ht extracellular levels (millan et al 1998), produces an
increase in protein kinase c (pkc) activity in the striatum
(dwivedi and pandey 1999). it is noteworthy that the phosphatidylinositol (pi)-signaling pathway has been shown to play a
role in mediating the effect of the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c
receptor on da release in vivo (de deurwaerdère et al 2004) and
that d2 receptors are also coupled to this signaling system
(hernandez-lopez et al 2000). thus, it is tempting to speculate
that haloperidol may indirectly alter  xxxg1115xxx  function
through an action at the level of common effector pathway
(dwivedi and pandey 1999; wolf and schutz 1997).
in general, all of the presently reported results provide further
insight into the mechanisms underlying the 5-ht/da interaction
and suggest the existence of distinct tonic and phasic inhibitory
controls exerted by central 5-ht2c receptors on da neuron
activity. on the one hand, as previously reported for the striatum

biol psychiatry 2006;59:568 –575 573
of freely moving animals (lucas et al 2000), we found that sb
206553 is able to potentiate the release of da induced by a low
(.01 mg/kg) but not a high dose (.1 mg/kg) of haloperidol in both
the nac and the striatum. this finding extends to the nac the
idea that the degree of da neuron activity, consequent to central
 xxxg656xxx  blockade, is a limiting factor for the ability of sb
206553 to disinhibit haloperidol-induced da release (lucas et al
2000; navailles et al 2004 . furthermore, this suggests that
constitutive activity of the  xxxg1115xxx  modulates da release
by controlling da nerve firing rate (lucas et al 2000). on the
other hand, we confirmed that basal da release is sensitive to
phasic inhibitory control by agonist-driven  xxxg1115xxx 
activation (de deurwaerdère et al 2004). furthermore, the fact
that sb 242084 potentiates the release of da induced by cocaine
and phencyclidine (hutson et al 2000; navailles et al 2004) but
not haloperidol, suggests that endogenous 5-ht by acting at
5-ht2c receptors phasically inhibits da release. indeed, cocaine
and phencyclidine, as contrasted with haloperidol (ferré and
artigas 1995; ichikawa et al 1998), increase central 5-ht extracellular levels in the brain. thus, it can be hypothesized that
5-ht2c antagonists may affect da released by drugs increasing
both da neuronal firing and 5-ht extracellular levels. it is
therefore conceivable that increased endogenous 5-ht may
exert phasic inhibitory control on cortical and subcortical da
release via  xxxg1115xxx  stimulation in conditions of enhanced da function (navailles et al 2004; pozzi et al 2002). the
occurrence of distinct tonic and phasic controls on da release
may involve changes of the level of constitutive activity of 5-ht2c
receptors (barker et al 1994; niswender et al 1999; price et al
2001) or the recruitment of regionally distinct populations of
5-ht2c receptors (filip and cunningham 2003; lucas and spampinato 2000; prisco et al 1994).
from a clinical point of view, it is important to remember that
the therapeutic effects of apds occur only after long-term
treatments at doses eliciting about 65% to 70% occupancy of
da-d2 receptors (kapur et al 2000; strange 2001). the low doses
of apds used in the present study to unmask the influence of
 xxxg1115xxx  function on apd-induced da release lead to
only 5% to 10% occupancy of da-d2 receptors (schotte et al
1996). it is well known that acute (millan et al 1998) and chronic
(shilliam and dawson 2005) treatment with apds lead to different modifications of mesoaccumbal and nigrostriatal da neuron
activity (blackburn et al 2002). thus, the experimental design
used in this study (acute administration of low doses of apds)
does not allow one to directly ascribe a clinical significance to the
obtained results. beyond these considerations, we believe that
our findings deserve attention from a therapeutic point of view,
in that they underline the need to take into account the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors in the mechanism of action of
apds in vivo. the fact that clozapine and haloperidol may affect
the level of constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors in an
opposite manner emphasizes the clinical potential of 5-ht2c
inverse agonism (milligan et al 1995). indeed, the significance of
the 5-ht2c inverse agonism for apd atypicity is an issue currently debated in the literature (herrick-davies et al 2000; rauser
et al 2001) that needs to be further evaluated in vivo with other
typical and atypical apds displaying different affinities and
 xxxd1422xxx  properties at 5-ht2c receptors. in vitro long-term
treatment with 5-ht2c inverse agonists induces novel effects that
differ from those induced by 5-ht2c antagonists (berg et al
1999). the high affinity together with the  xxxd1422xxx  activity
of some apds at 5-ht2c receptors in vitro have been proposed
to account for the atypical downregulation of 5-ht2c receptors
www.sobp.org/journal

574 biol psychiatry 2006;59:568 –575
following long-term treatment of apds (tarazi et al 2002), an
effect that could contribute to the maintenance of their therapeutic actions (milligan and bond 1997; van oekelen et al 2003).
long-term in vivo studies are needed to gain a deeper insight
into the role of the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors and
extend this issue to other apds.
in conclusion, the present study provides in vivo evidence
that the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors participates in
the daergic effects of the apds clozapine and haloperidol and
suggests for the first time that clozapine modulates subcortical
da release by acting as a 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  in vivo. these
findings extend the in vivo identification of the constitutive
activity of 5-ht2 receptors (de deurwaerdère et al 2004; harvey
et al 1999) and underscore the need for a better understanding of
the pathophysiological role of constitutive receptor activity and
of the therapeutic potential of inverse agonism (milligan et al
1995; rauser et al 2001).
