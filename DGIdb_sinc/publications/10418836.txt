 xxxd3522xxx  deficiency and osteopenia in disuse-affected limbs of  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx -deficient elderly stroke patients.  bone mineral density is reduced in stroke patients on the hemiplegic and contralateral sides, reflecting a degree of paralysis and  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  deficiency. because the deficiency of  xxxd3522xxx , a factor essential for site-specific carboxylation of  xxxg260xxx , is also associated with reduced bone mineral density, an additional contribution of  xxxd3522xxx  to bone changes was assessed in 168 elderly patients with long-standing post-stroke hemiplegia and hypovitaminosis d. sera were analyzed to relate  xxxd2941xxx  concentrations to bone-related biochemical indexes and bone mineral density measured by radiodensitometry of the second metacarpal. bone mineral density was lower on both sides in patients than in the 56 controls (p < 0.02). serum  xxxd2941xxx  concentrations, which correlated positively with  xxxg260xxx  concentrations (p < 0.0001), were lower in patients (0.48 +/- 0.47 nmol/l) than controls (1.33 +/- 0.49; p < 0.0001). serum  xxxg260xxx  and 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations were lower in patients than controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ionized ca concentrations were higher in patients (1.277 +/- 0.041 mmol/l) than controls (1.210 +/- 0.049; p < 0.0001), correlating with the barthel index. multivariate linear regression identified  xxxd2941xxx ,  xxxg260xxx , 25-hydroxyvitamin d, ionized calcium, and the barthel index as independent bone mineral density determinants on the hemiplegic side and 25-hydroxyvitamin d, calcium, and the barthel index on the intact side. immobilization and  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency had stronger osteopenic effects on the hemiplegic side than contralaterally.
