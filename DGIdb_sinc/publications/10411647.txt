 abstract 
 
 kinetic studies of tetrameric recombinant human  xxxg2276xxx  isoform 1 (hth1) have revealed properties so far not reported for this enzyme. firstly, with the natural cofactor (6 r )‐ l  xxxd2033xxx  ‐5,6,7,8‐tetrahydrobiopterin (h 4 biopterin) a time‐dependent change (burst) in enzyme activity was observed, with a half‐time of about 20 s for the kinetic transient. secondly, nonhyperbolic saturation behaviour was found for h 4 biopterin with a pronounced negative cooperativity (0.39 <  h  < 0.58; [ s ] 0.5  = 24 ± 4 mu m ). on phosphorylation of ser40 by protein kinase a, the affinity for h 4 biopterin increased ([ s ] 0.5  = 11 ± 2 mu m ) and the negative cooperativity was amplified ( h  = 0.27 ± 0.03). the dimeric c‐terminal deletion mutant (delta473–528) of hth1 also showed negative cooperativity of h 4 biopterin binding ( h  = 0.4). cooperativity was not observed with the cofactor analogues 6‐methyl‐5,6,7,8‐tetrahydropterin ( h  = 0.9 ± 0.1;  k m  = 62.7 ± 5.7 mu m ) and 3‐methyl‐5,6,7,8‐tetrahydropterin (h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin)( h  = 1.0 ± 0.1;  k m  = 687 ± 50 mu m ). in the presence of 1 m m  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin, used as a competitive cofactor analogue to bh 4 , hyperbolic saturation curves were also found for h 4 biopterin ( h  = 1.0), thus confirming the genuine nature of the kinetic negative cooperativity. this cooperativity was confirmed by real‐time biospecific interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance detection. the equilibrium binding of h 4 biopterin to the immobilized iron‐free apoenzyme results in a saturable positive resonance unit (deltaru) response with negative cooperativity ( h  = 0.52–0.56). infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a reduced thermal stability both of the apo‐and the holo‐hth1 on binding of h 4 biopterin and  l  xxxd2033xxx  ‐dihydrobiopterin (h 2 biopterin). moreover, the ligand‐bound forms of the enzyme also showed a decreased resistance to limited tryptic proteolysis. these findings indicate that the binding of h 4 biopterin at the active site induces a destabilizing conformational change in the enzyme which could be related to the observed negative cooperativity. thus, our studies provide new insight into the regulation of th by the concentration of h 4 biopterin which may have significant implications for the physiological regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis in neuroendocrine cells.

 aromatic amino acid hydroxylases such as  xxxg2276xxx  (th, ec 1.14.16.2) and  xxxg1660xxx  (pah, ec 1.14.16.1) require the reduced pterin cofactor (6 r )‐ l  xxxd2033xxx  ‐5,6,7,8‐tetrahydrobiopterin (h 4 biopterin) to activate dioxygen and hydroxylate the aromatic ring of the amino acid substrate (reviewed in [ [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ]). based on steady‐state kinetic studies of the recombinant rat th‐catalyzed reaction, a sequential reaction mechanism has been proposed with an ordered binding of h 4 biopterin as the first substrate, followed by dioxygen and  l ‐tyrosine ( l ‐tyr) [ [ 3 ] ]. human th (hth) is phosphorylated by a variety of protein kinases at four ser residues (in positions 8, 19, 31 and 40) in the n‐terminal regulatory domain [ [ 4 ] ], and phosphorylation of ser40 by camp‐dependent protein kinase results in a decrease in the  k m  for the cofactor h 4 biopterin as well as a reduced affinity for the catecholamine feed‐back inhibitors [ [ 5 ] ].
          
 the recent x‐ray crystal structure at 2.3 å resolution of the ‘catalytic domain’ of rat th [ [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] has yielded valuable new information on the active‐site structure. the iron is coordinated by three strong ligands, his331, his336 and glu376, arranged in a trigonal planar configuration. at the axial positions there are two weakly interacting water molecules completing the coordination geometry. the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of rat th in the presence of the oxidized cofactor  l  xxxd2033xxx  ‐7,8‐dihydrobiopterin (h 2 biopterin) has also recently been solved showing that a pi‐stacking with phe300 is the main interaction of the pterin with the enzyme [ [ 7 ] ]. the bound pterin also forms hydrogen bonds from n‐8 to the main chain carbonyl of leu295, from the hydroxyl at c‐1′ to the main chain amides of leu294 and leu295, and from the hydroxyl at c‐2′ to glu332. the distance from the iron to the pterin 4alpha carbon was 5.6 å. this crystal structure is in agreement with the conformation of the amino acid substrate and pterin cofactor when bound at the active site of hth1 as estimated by  1 h‐nmr spectroscopy [ [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] ].
          
 previous observations have led to the suggestion that th may be an allosteric enzyme with a positive cooperativity of cofactor binding [ [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] ]. it has also been suggested that the four isoforms of hth (hth1–4) show regulatory kinetic properties for the natural enantiomer (6 r )‐tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor, showing two apparent  k m ‐values when assayed at high (> 200 mu m )  l ‐tyr concentration [ [ 12 ] ]. here we have investigated  in vitro  the steady‐state kinetics of the recombinant tetrameric human th isoform 1 (hth1), a dimeric truncated c‐terminal deletion mutant (delta473–528) of hth1 produced in  escherichia coli  and a native form isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. it is shown that the binding of  l ‐tyr to all three forms of the enzyme follows michaelis–menten kinetics whereas the cofactor h 4 biopterin binds with negative cooperativity, which increases on phosphorylation of ser40. to examine this finding in more detail, we also report here for the first time the use of surface plasmon resonance (spr) analysis to determine the binding isotherm of a substrate to an enzyme, by which the negative cooperativity of the cofactor binding was confirmed. moreover, we have used infrared spectroscopy and limited tryptic proteolysis to study potential conformational changes associated with the binding of the pterin cofactor.

  enzymes 
 recombinant human  xxxg2276xxx  isoform 1 (hth1) was expressed in the pet system of  e. coli  and purified as a tetramer to > 90% homogeneity as previously described [ [ 13 ] ]. a truncated c‐terminal deletion mutant of hth1 was constructed and expressed/purified as a dimer by the same protocol as the full‐length form. a stop signal was introduced in codon 473 of the hth1 cdna as described [ [ 14 ] ] using the mutagenic primer ctg gac agc ccc tag gcc. all clones were sequenced to verify the authenticity of the mutagenesis and to exclude mutations due to taq dna polymerase misincorporation. the oligomeric state of both the full‐length hth1 and the truncated delta473–528 was determined by gel permeation chromatography as described [ [ 15 ] ]. phosphorylation by camp dependent protein kinase was performed as described [ [ 16 ] ].
             
  xxxg2276xxx  was isolated from bovine adrenal medulla as described [ [ 17 ] ], giving an electrophoretically (sds/page) homogenous enzyme preparation.
             
 recombinant human  xxxg1660xxx  (hpah) was expressed in the pmal system of  e. coli  and purified as described [ [ 15 ] ].
             
 recombinant human pterin‐4a‐carbinolamine dehydratase was a generous gift from dr sandro ghisla, university of konstanz, germany. 
 
 
  assay of  xxxg2276xxx  activity 
 th activity was assayed by two alternative methods. routinely the th activity was assayed at ph 7.0 (hepes buffer) at 25 °c as described [ [ 18 ] ] using an incubation mixture containing about 1 mu m  (subunit concentration) hth1, 0.5 mg·ml −1  bovine  xxxg124xxx , 1 m m  dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg·ml −1  catalase, 20 mu m  ferrous ammonium sulfate in 100 m m  nahepes, ph 7.0 and variable concentrations of  l ‐[3,5‐ 3 h]‐tyrosine and h 4 biopterin (50 mu m  tyosine and 500 mu m  h 4 biopterin under standard conditions, described above). the enzyme preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen and diluted in the assay buffer containing bovine  xxxg124xxx  and fe(ii). at selected time intervals (1–10 min), the release of  3 h 2 o was measured in aliquots of the reaction mixture. alternatively, the product  l ‐dopa was assayed by hplc [ [ 19 ] ]. the time‐course of the reaction was also followed by a coupled reaction in which the consumption of the cofactor h 4 biopterin was measured by its regeneration with nadh and  xxxg1912xxx  [ [ 20 ] ]. hth1 was preincubated with 50 µ m l ‐tyr (5 min) and 20 mu m  ferrous ammonium sulfate in 100 m m  nahepes (1 min) at 25 °c prior to the addition of the cofactor. data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program  enzfitter  (biosoft, mo, usa) and knack and röhm[ [ 21 ] ].
             
 
 
  surface plasmon resonance analyses 
 the interactions between hth1 and its substrates were studied by real‐time biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance detection with a dual‐channel biacorex instrument (biacore ab, uppsala, sweden). the enzyme (diluted in 10 m m  acetate buffer to a concentration of 0.34 mug·mul −1 ) was immobilized covalently on a hydrophilic carboxymethyl dextran matrix (sensor chip cm5) by the standard amine coupling reaction, as described by the manufacturer, at ph 5.4. a surface concentration of 10–17 ng·mm −2  (42–71 pmol·mm −2 ) and a deltaru of 10 000–17 000 was obtained. egg white lysozyme was immobilized on the matrix of the reference channel. after the coupling reactions 70 mul of 10 m m  dithiothreitol in hbs‐buffer (10 m m  hepes, 150 m m  nacl, 3.4 m m  edta and 0.005% (v/v) of the surfactant p20) was passed through both channels in order to decrease the time for baseline stabilization (empirical observation) followed by an equilibration with the hbs‐buffer ph 7.4 for 1–2 h at a standard flow rate of 5 mul·min −1 ; a typical baseline drift of −0.01 ru·s −1  was then obtained. the analytes (h 4 biopterin, its analogues and  l ‐tyr) were diluted in hbs‐buffer ph 7.4 or the same buffer without 3.4 m m  edta immediately before injection; the pterin cofactor stock solutions contained 10 m m  dithiothreitol or no dithiothreitol. in order to exclude any contribution to the deltaru responses related to changes in matrix conformation, e.g. by a small change in ph, the ph of the injected analyte was controlled to an accuracy of ± 0.01 relative to the mobile phase; the cofactors were dissolved and stored in acidic solution to avoid auto‐oxidation. thus, no response artifacts associated with changes in the dextran matrix were then observed. a new sensor chip was used for each titration experiment; the enzyme was stable for at least 6 h at 25 °c, as the deltaru response to added analyte was reproducible within this time period.
             
 
 
  infrared spectroscopy 
 samples for infrared spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized apo‐hth1 in 20 m m  na‐hepes, 150 m m  nacl, ph or pd (h 2 o or d 2 o based buffers) 7.4, in the presence or the absence of 200 mu m  ferrous ammonium sulfate, as indicated. to study the effect of h 4 biopterin and analogues on the conformation and thermal stability of hth, the enzyme was incubated (5 min at 25 °c) with 0.5 m m  h 4 biopterin and 5 m m  dithiothreitol (to keep h 4 biopterin reduced), or with 5 m m  h 2 biopterin. prior to the measurements, samples were centrifuged (10 min  xxxd1891xxx  500  g ) to remove any sedimentable protein aggregates. samples with a protein concentration of 15–18 mg·ml −1  were applied to a thermostated cell between two caf 2  windows with a pathlength of 6 mum (h 2 o) or 50 mum (d 2 o). samples in deuterated buffer were left 3 h at room temperature to allow isotopic substitution of the protein exchangeable nh protons. spectra were recorded in nicolet 520 (d 2 o samples) or magna 550 (h 2 o samples) spectrometers equipped with mct detectors. a total of 200 (d 2 o) and 1000 (h 2 o) scans were accumulated for each spectrum, using a shuttle device. thermal stability was studied on samples heated in steps of about 3 °c in the interval of 25–85 °c. after each heating step, the sample was left to equilibrate for 5 min and the corresponding spectrum recorded. solvent subtraction, deconvolution, determination of band–position and curve fitting of the original amide i band were performed as described [ [ 22 ] ]. experiments were performed in duplicate.
             
 
 
  limited proteolysis by trypsin and sds/page 
 tryptic digestion of hth1 (1.4 mg·ml −1 ; 23 m m  subunit) was performed at 25 °c in 20 m m  na/hepes, 200 m m  nacl at ph 7.4, in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of fe(ii) (added as sodium ammonium sulphate) and in the presence or absence (as indicated) of 0.5 m m  h 2 biopterin (or h 4 biopterin) with a trypsin : hth1 ratio of 1 : 200. aliquots (14 mug hth1) were removed at 0, 0.1, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 min; 0.015 mg·ml −1  soybean  xxxd207xxx  and sds‐buffer were added in order to stop the reaction. sds/page (10%) was performed at 180 v and the gels stained with coomassie brilliant blue. the gels were scanned using deskscan ii (hewlett packard co.) and the raw volume of the bands was measured using the phoretix 1d analysis software (nonlinear dynamics ltd, 1996).

  essential properties of the enzyme preparations used 
 in the present study we have used the recombinant tetrameric human  xxxg2276xxx  isoenzyme 1 (hth1) and its dimeric c‐terminal truncated (delta473–528) form produced in  e. coli  and purified by affinity chromatography on heparin–sepharose [ [ 13 ] ]. both forms of the enzyme revealed a purity of > 90% on sds/page with the expected subunit  m r  values of 60 000 and 53 000 for the wild‐type and truncated form, respectively (data not shown). gel‐permeation chromatography revealed that the wild‐type enzyme was a tetramer and the truncated form was a dimer (data not shown) as expected from the deletion of the tetramerization domain [ [ 6 ] ]. the wild‐type enzyme revealed approx. eighty percent stimulation of its specific activity by adding fe(ii) to 1230 nmol dopa min −1 ·mg −1 . in the equilibrium binding studies by spr analysis, an apoenzyme was obtained by including 3.4 m m  edta in the flow buffer and a 5‐min exposure to 10 m m  dithiothreitol.
             
 in addition, we have studied the kinetic properties of th purified from bovine adrenal medulla, which contains 0.6 mol iron per mol subunit, and is isolated as a partially inhibited enzyme due to catecholamines bound at the active site (about 0.1 mol noradrenaline per mol subunit and 0.25 mol adrenaline per mol subunit) [ [ 17 ] ].
             
 
 
  kinetic studies of the recombinant human enzyme 
 in our coupled assay of th activity, in which the consumption of the cofactor h 4 biopterin was measured by its regeneration with nadh/ xxxg1912xxx  (at saturating concentrations), we observed that there was a time‐dependent change (burst) in the enzyme activity, i.e. a change from an initially high activity to a low, almost linear, steady‐state rate (data not shown). this time‐course was confirmed by the standard assay ( fig. 1 ) in which the product  l ‐dopa was measured by hplc at increasing time points. no significant difference was observed in the time‐course when hth1 was preincubated with 50 µ m l ‐tyr (5 min) and 20 mu m  fe(ii) (1 min) at 25 °c prior to the addition of h 4 biopterin ( fig. 1 ), when the reaction was started by the simultaneous addition of  l ‐tyr and h 4 biopterin or when 2.5 mu m  pterin‐4a‐carbinolamine dehydratase was present in the reaction mixture (data not shown). an apparent rate constant of tau = 25 s −1  was estimated for the transition between the initial and almost linear steady‐state velocities, with a half‐time of about 20 s. when the enzyme was preincubated with h 4 biopterin instead of  l ‐tyr, the half‐time of the transient did not change, but the steady‐state velocity was slightly increased ( fig. 1 ). the transient was not affected by the preincubation with 15 mu m  of the product  l ‐dopa, although the hydroxylation of  l ‐tyrosine was reduced by 16% at  t  = 3 min (data not shown).

(•), preincubation for 3 min with h 4 biopterin and (○), preincubation for 3 min with  l ‐tyr.14% of  l ‐tyr was converted to  l ‐dopa after 60 s. 
 
 
 
 
 with  l ‐tyr as variable substrate in the standard assay the rate of hydroxylation ( t  = 1 min) revealed an apparent  k m ‐value of 6.6 ± 0.2 µ m  with substrate inhibition observed at concentrations > 50 µ m , essentially as described [ [ 13 ] ]. in contrast, nonhyperbolic saturation behaviour was observed for h 4 biopterin ( fig. 2a ), and the data analyses revealed a pronounced negative cooperativity for the binding of the cofactor, with a hill coefficient ( h ) of 0.45–0.60 and half‐maximal activity at 19–26 mu m  (range for seven experiments). these parameters do not seem to be significantly affected by the reaction time ( table 1 ), and similar saturation curves were observed when the product was measured after 1, 4 and 7 min; the highest specific activity was obtained in the 1‐min assay as expected from the time‐course ( fig. 1 ). saturation curves for h 4 biopterin were also determined in the presence of lower concentrations of the substrate  l ‐tyr, but similar results were obtained. at a fixed concentration of 20 mu m l ‐tyr the values [ s ] 0.5  = 24 ± 0.1 mu m  and  h  = 0.6 ± 0.06 were obtained for h 4 biopterin. on phosphorylation of ser40 by protein kinase a [ [ 23 ] ], both the negative cooperativity ( h  = 0.27 ± 0.03) and the affinity for the cofactor ([ s ] 0.5  = 10 ± 2 mu m ) increased ( table 1 ). on the other hand, negative cooperativity was not observed with the commonly used cofactor analog 6‐methyl‐tetrahydropterin (h 4 6‐methyl‐pterin)( h  = 0.90 ± 0.1 and [ s ] 0.5  =  k m  = 63 ± 6 mu m ).

 the effect of the oligomeric state of the enzyme on the cooperativity was also studied using a dimeric c‐terminal truncated form (delta473–528), lacking the tetramerization motif [ [ 6 ] ]. the specific activity of this dimer (38 nmol  l ‐dopa min −1 ·mg −1 ) was only about 4% of the full‐length hth1 activity. however, the affinity ([ s ] 0.5  = 9.3 ± 1.9 mu m ) and cooperativity ( h  = 0.37 ± 0.06) for the cofactor were similar to those of the tetrameric full‐length enzyme ( table 1 ); the  k m ‐value for l‐tyr was 4.0 ± 0.9 mu m .
             
 
 
  3‐methyl‐tetrahydropterin as a substrate and its modulation of enzyme kinetics with h 4 biopterin as the cofactor
             
 the 3‐methyl‐tetrahydropterin (h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin) cofactor analogue gave a hyperbolic saturation behaviour ( h  = 1.0), a high apparent  k m ‐value of 687 ± 50 mu m  and low  v max  of 30 nmol  l ‐dopa min −1 ·mg −1  (i.e. about 2.5% of that with h 4 biopterin) with hth1. thus, h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin represents a noncooperative analogue to h 4 biopterin suitable to give further information on the cooperativity‐generating mechanism [ [ 24 ] ]. in the presence of h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin an increase in the hill coefficient for h 4 biopterin was observed ( fig. 2b ), and at 1 m m  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin the negative cooperativity was abolished ( table 1 ). the increase in the hill coefficient was accompanied by a 1.5‐fold increase in the apparent  v max , a twofold decrease in the [ s ] 0.5 ‐value for h 4 biopterin and a 2.7‐fold increase in the rate at 100 mu m  h 4 biopterin ( fig. 2 ). in the presence of 1 m m  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin, hyperbolic saturation curves for h 4 biopterin were also obtained for the truncated (delta473–528) and the phosphorylated full‐length hth1 forms (data not shown). due to the low specific activity of the truncated dimeric form, no significant transient could be measured.
             
 for comparison, the effect of h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin on the activity of a homologous enzyme, recombinant human  xxxg1660xxx  (hpah) was also studied. at assay conditions comparable to that of hth, hpah revealed a noncooperative binding of h 4 biopterin ( h  = 1) both in the absence and the presence of h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin. furthermore, we found that 1 m m  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin decreased the  v max  for the phenylalanine catalyzed reaction by 43% and increased the  k m ‐value for the cofactor (data not shown).

 the negative cooperativity of h 4 biopterin‐binding observed in steady‐state kinetics and its abolition on coincubation with the cofactor analogue h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin sugests that site–site interactions may be involved in generating the negative cooperativity. this possibility was further examined by studying the saturation behaviour of the enzyme in equilibrium binding experiments with h 4 biopterin (and  l ‐tyr) by biospecific interaction analyses based on spr detection. the iron‐free apoenzyme form was selected for these studies because the recombinant hth is isolated essentially as apoenzyme [ [ 9 ] ]. ten to fifteen nanograms of the tetrameric wild‐type apoenzyme (240 kda) were immobilized to the dextran matrix to serve as the reaction surface (channel 1), and lysozyme (14.6 kda) was immobilized on to a separated matrix as a control surface (channel 2) as described in the materials and methods section. due to the low molecular mass of the analytes (h 4 biopterin and  l ‐tyr) their binding to the enzyme is expected to occur without any limitation in mass transfer [ [ 26 ] ]. as the spr response is linearly related to the change in surface mass concentration of the analyte, a theoretical spr response of 68 ru at maximum binding of h 4 biopterin (241.2 da) was estimated at a deltaru of 17 000 (240 kda) for the immobilized tetrameric enzyme and an expected stoichiometry of 4 : 1 at saturation (four identical subunits in the tetramer). the immobilized enzyme remained stable in terms of substrate binding for at least 6 h at 25 °c.
             
 results shown in  fig. 3  show that the immobilized apoenzyme binds h 4 biopterin. as expected, the time‐course looks like a square wave, with the equilibrium response being reached within seconds, and the signal rapidly returning to the baseline level at the end of the injection. thus, the estimation of the on and off rates was not possible. a signal‐to‐noise ratio of > 30 was obtained at an analyte concentration of 300 mu m . when the deltaru value at equilibrium binding was measured as a function of cofactor concentration, the affinity ([ s ] 0.5  = 8 mu m ), calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the binding isotherm ( fig. 4a ), was slightly higher than that observed by steady‐state kinetic analysis (24 mu m  < [ s ] 0.5  < 54 mu m ). furthermore, the spr binding isotherm also revealed a negative cooperativity of cofactor binding ( h  = 0.52–0.56) with a deltaru value of 74 at saturation ( fig. 4a ). this value is close to the theoretically expected (deltaru = 68, see above) for the binding of four molecules of h 4 biopterin per enzyme tetramer.

 from  fig. 4b  it is further seen that the pterin cofactor analogue h 4 3‐methylpterin also binds to the immobilized apoenzyme, but with a lower affinity than h 4 biopterin as observed in the steady‐state binding isotherm, in agreement with the steady‐state kinetics ( k m  = 687 ± 50 mu m ). however, in this case the spr binding isotherm could not be used to calculate the affinity (the nonlinear regression analysis did not converge).
             
 
 
  effect of pterin cofactor on thermal stability of hth1 
 we then used fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to characterize possible conformational changes in hth1 as a consequence of h 4 biopterin or h 2 biopterin binding to the enzyme. h 2 biopterin was used as an inactive oxidized analogue of h 4 biopterin, which inhibits the enzyme competitively against the cofactor [ [ 8 ] ]. the infrared spectrum of apo‐ and holo‐hth1 can be resolved after deconvolution into several components both in d 2 o and in h 2 o [ [ 16 ] ]. the secondary structure of the enzyme was previously estimated to be 42–43% alpha‐helix, 35% beta‐extended structures (beta‐sheet and beta‐strand), 14% beta‐turns and 8–10% unordered structure, with essentially the same findings for the apo‐ and the holoenzyme [ [ 16 ] ]. this finding was confirmed in the present study. the high alpha‐helix content of the full‐length enzyme is in good agreement with that determined for the crystal structure of a truncated form of rat th lacking 163 amino acids at the n‐terminus [ [ 6 ] ]. no significant changes in the infrared spectrum of hth1 were observed in either the apo‐ or the holoenzyme upon h 4 biopterin and h 2 biopterin binding, indicating that these ligands do not induce significant changes in the secondary structure of hth1 (data not shown).
             
 the thermal stability of the enzyme was also studied by infrared spectroscopy in the presence and the absence of h 4 biopterin and h 2 biopterin. the holoenzyme (containing iron at the active site) has been shown to be more thermostable and resistant to limited proteolysis than the apoenzyme (essentially iron free) due to a more compact subunit tertiary structure [ [ 16 ] ]. this finding was confirmed in the present study by following the thermal unfolding of the enzyme by the empirical parameter i 1618  : i 1650 [ [ 16 ] ]; the midpoint denaturation temperature ( t m ) was 55 °c and 49 °c for the holo‐ and apoenzyme, respectively ( fig. 5a ). interestingly, the  t m ‐value decreased on binding of h 2 biopterin to the holoenzyme ( t m  55 °c→51 °c) as well as to the apoenzyme ( t m  49 °c→43 °c). for the holoenzyme the effect of h 4 biopterin binding was similar to that of h 2 biopterin ( t m  55 °c→51 °c). however, no significant change was observed for the temperature interval (delta t ) in which the denaturation took place. this ligand‐induced decrease in thermostability might be, in the absence of significant alterations of the secondary structure, a consequence of a conformational change affecting the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of the enzyme.

 the effect of pterin binding on the conformation and stability of hth1 was also examined by studying the susceptibility of the substrate‐free and substrate (h 2 biopterin and h 4 biopterin)‐bound enzyme to limited tryptic proteolysis. both in the absence and presence of either h 2 biopterin or h 4 biopterin, proteolyzed forms of molecular mass close to the 58‐kda full‐length enzyme were observed on sds/page at initial time points using a trypsin : protein ratio of 1 : 200 (results not shown). the major proteolytic product at later time points was a 47‐kda catalytically active fragment which was further processed to species of lower electrophoretic mobility, e.g. a 32‐kda band [ [ 16 ] ]. based on scanning and quantification of the resulting electrophoresis bands, the susceptibility of the enzyme to limited proteolysis is increased in the presence of h 2 biopterin ( fig. 5b ) and h 4 biopterin (not shown).
             
 
 
  comparative studies on bovine adrenal  xxxg2276xxx  
 th isolated from bovine adrenal medulla contains a considerable amount of adrenaline/noradrenaline‐inhibited enzyme [ [ 27 ] ]. from  fig. 6  it is seen that the rate‐concentration curve, with h 4 biopterin as the variable substrate, is biphasic, and the data can be fitted to a sigmoidal curve indicating an apparent positive cooperativity of h 4 biopterin binding ( h  = 2.2 ± 0.2) and a high apparent [ s ] 0.5 ‐value. however, when the bound catecholamines were removed by short‐term exposure to ph 5.0, the enzyme was converted to a form with negative cooperativity ( h  = 0.36 ± 0.03) and increased affinity ([ s ] 0.5  = 47 ± 4 mu m ) for cofactor binding ( fig. 6 ). furthermore, when the dopamine complex of hth1 was prepared [ [ 23 ] ] by preincubation of the enzyme with stoichiometric amounts of fe(ii) and dopamine (18.3 mu m  of th subunit), followed by removal of any free ligands, a similar biphasic rate–concentration curve as shown in  fig. 6  for bth was observed with a fivefold increase in the apparent [ s ] 0.5 ‐value for the cofactor (data not shown).

  discussion 
  xxxg2276xxx , by catalyzing the hydroxylation of  l ‐tyr to  l ‐dopa, is considered to be the rate‐limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline) (reviewed in [ [ 1 ] ]). although this nonheme iron enzyme has been studied intensively for years, the detailed mechanism of action and regulation have remained elusive (reviewed in [ [ 2 ] ]). in the present study, we focus on the cooperative properties of the enzyme, using the full‐length hth1 human enzyme (a tetramer) and a truncated form in which the c‐terminal tetramerization domain was deleted (a dimer). it is shown that the natural pterin cofactor (h 4 biopterin) binds at the active site of the tetrameric form with negative cooperativity, both in kinetic studies and in equilibrium binding as studied by spr analysis. moreover, we show that the apparent positive cooperative binding of h 4 biopterin reported in previous kinetic studies [ [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] ] is related to the presence of iron‐coordinated catecholamine inhibitors in enzyme preparations isolated from different biological materials. heterogeneity in the enzyme preparations as an explanation for the appearance of negative cooperativity in the binding curve has been excluded on the basis of: (a) several highly purified enzyme preparations from different sources revealing negative cooperativity of cofactor binding, and (b) the negative cooperativity being rather specific for h 4 biopterin and modulated by cofactor analogues as well as by phosphorylation of the enzyme.
          
 
  cooperative binding of the pterin cofactor at the active site of  xxxg2276xxx  
 the recent crystal structure analyses of a truncated tetrameric form (n‐terminal deletion) of rat th [ [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ], containing the catalytic and tetramerization domains of the enzyme, have revealed that the active site in each monomer consists of a 17‐å deep cleft at the centre of the catalytic domain basket, with the catalytically active iron atom 10 å below the enzyme surface. thus, the tetrameric enzyme contains four potentially equivalent binding sites for the substrates (h 4 biopterin, l‐tyr and o 2 ). so far, only the crystal structure of the binary rth‐h 2 biopterin complex has been determined, demonstrating the mode of pterin binding at the active site [ [ 7 ] ].
             
 the possibility that th is an allosteric enzyme has been considered based on steady‐state kinetic studies of partially purified rth from pc12 cells [ [ 10 ] ] and from striatum [ [ 11 ] ]. for both enzyme forms, an apparent positive cooperativity of cofactor binding was reported, with a hill coefficient of 2.52 ± 0.13 [ [ 10 ] ] and 1.79 ± 0.23 [ [ 11 ] ] for the natural pterin cofactor (h 4 biopterin). another kinetic property reported in these studies was very high ‘ k m ‐values’ for h 4 biopterin, i.e. 351 ± 64 µ m [ [ 10 ] ] and 337 ± 189 µ m [ [ 11 ] ], which are quite representative of previous literature values obtained for similar enzyme preparations. when compared to our data obtained for the recombinant hth ( table 1 ), their kinetic parameters can be explained by the difference in enzyme source. thus, the th obtained from cell/tissue extracts is known to yield a variable amount of enzyme forms containing tightly bound catecholamines [ [ 27 ] ], which bind by bidentate coordination to the active site iron in hth1 [ [ 28 ] ] and in  xxxg1660xxx  [ [ 29 ] ] and reversibly inhibit the enzyme [ [ 23 ] ]. as shown in  fig. 6 , an apparent positive cooperativity for the low‐affinity binding of h 4 biopterin was found for th isolated from bovine adrenal medulla, but on removal of bound catecholamines (at ph 5.0) the enzyme was converted to a form in which h 4 biopterin binds with increased affinity and negative cooperativity ( h  = 0.34 ± 0.04). by contrast, the human recombinant hth1 enzyme used in the present study is devoid of any bound catecholamine and is isolated in a nonphosphorylated form [ [ 5 ] ]. however, the stable dopamine complex of hth1 revealed a similar biphasic rate‐concentration curve as shown for bth as isolated.
             
 our results have shown that h 4 biopterin binds to the active site of hth1 with negative cooperativity as evidenced by the rate concentration curves, at  l ‐tyr concentrations (20–50 mu m ) where substrate inhibition is not observed. this behaviour is further supported by equilibrium binding studies based on real‐time biospecific interaction analyses by spr detection. for the apoenzyme, occupancy of the four potential h 4 biopterin binding sites of the tetrameric wild‐type enzyme results in a saturable spr response, with an affinity ([ s ] 0.5  = 8 mu m ) and hill coefficient ( h  = 0.5) which are remarkably similar to that observed in the steady‐state kinetics ( table 1 ). this cooperativity has not been observed in previous steady‐state kinetic studies of  e. coli  expressed hth isoforms [ [ 12 ] , [ 30 ] ]. thus, nasrin  et al . [ [ 12 ] ] interpreted similar rate concentration curves in terms of two different  k m ‐values for h 4 biopterin, based on lineweaver–burk plots.
             
 
 
  effect of phosphorylation and cofactor analogues on kinetic parameters 
 the activity of th has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation by camp‐dependent protein kinase [ [ 31 ] ], and on phosphorylation of ser40 in hth1 the enzyme shows an increased affinity for the cofactor, as determined by kinetic analyses ([ [ 5 ] ], and this study) as well as a decreased affinity for catecholamine binding/inhibition [ [ 23 ] ]. in the present study it is shown ( table 1 ) that this phosphorylation decreases the cofactor concentration for half‐maximal activity ([ s ] 0.5 ) from 23 ± 2.4 to 10.5 ± 2.2 mu m , and that the degree of negative cooperativity is increased ( h  = 0.27 ± 0.03 for the phosphorylated hth1), making the enzyme more sensitive to changes in the concentration of cofactor in the low micromolar range.
             
 the finding that negative cooperativity was not observed with the commonly used cofactor analogue h 4 6‐methyl‐pterin, which binds with a lower affinity than h 4 biopterin, may indicate that the dihydroxypropyl side‐chain in h 4 biopterin is required for cooperative binding. the conformation of the hydroxyls at c‐1′ and c‐2′ in the dihydroxypropyl‐side chain at c‐6 in h 2 biopterin has been found to be in an almost‐ cis  configuration for the enzyme bound pterin, both by nmr [ [ 9 ] ] and by crystal structure analysis [ [ 7 ] ]. the crystal structure of the binary h 2 biopterin‐rth complex has also revealed that a hydrogen bond is formed between the c‐2′ oh and the carboxyl group at glu332.
             
 the modulatory effects of the cofactor analogue h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin on the kinetic parameters for h 4 biopterin further enlighten the mechanism of the negative cooperativity. thus, in the presence of h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin, which binds without cooperativity ( h  = 1.0) and with low affinity ( k m  = 687 ± 50 mu m ) to the cofactor site [martinez  et al . 1998], the rate‐concentration curve for h 4 biopterin changes. thus, in the presence of 1 m m  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin the kinetic cooperativity of h 4 biopterin is abolished ( table 1 ) which is accompanied by an increased specific activity and apparent  v max ‐value ( fig. 2 ). interestingly, in comparative studies on the structurally and functionally homologous enzyme  xxxg1660xxx  h 4 3‐methyl‐pterin functions only as a competive inhibitor. thus, the analogue increased the  k m ‐value for the noncooperative binding of h 4 biopterin.
             
 
 
  slow transient in kinetic analyses and ligand‐induced conformational changes 
 in addition to the negative cooperativity of the cofactor (h 4 biopterin) binding, the time‐course of the reaction revealed an initial ‘burst’ which slowly transforms into an almost linear steady‐state rate ( fig. 1 ). the half‐time for the kinetic transition was about 20 s, and was not significantly affected by preincubation at a high concentration (15 mu m ) of the product  l ‐dopa, although the hydroxylation of  l ‐tyr was reduced by 16% ( t  = 3 min). furthermore, the transient does not seem to be linked to the conformational changes observed as a result of pterin cofactor binding ( fig. 5 ) as it was not affected by preincubation with h 4 biopterin.
             
 in multisubstrate reactions, kinetic transients and negative cooperativity of substrate binding may be explained by alternative mechanisms [ [ 32 ] ], and at this point sufficient experimental details are not available for a thorough understanding of the th‐catalyzed reaction. the finding that the enzyme binds h 4 biopterin in the absence of  l ‐tyr with negative cooperativity ( fig. 4 ) as well as the elimination of the kinetic cooperativity by a high concentration of the low‐affinity competing cofactor analogue 3‐mph 4 , support a site–site interaction, similar to that reported for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase [ [ 24 ] ]. for both enzymes, the negative cooperativity can be explained by the ligand‐induced sequential conformational model of koshland  et al . [ [ 33 ] ]. the experimentally observed ligand‐induced decreased thermostability and increased susceptibility of the enzyme to limited proteolysis further suggest the existence of such a conformational change, which is not yet defined. the finding by fourier transform infrared that the secondary structure of hth1 is maintained upon ligand binding is in good agreement with the crystal structure analyses of the binary h 2 biopterin complex and the ligand‐free catalytic domain of rth [ [ 7 ] ]. therefore, this conformational change mainly involves modifications of the tertiary and/or quaternary structural features of the protein. unfortunately, no structural information is yet available for the regulatory domain.
             
 
 
  physiological significance of cooperative binding of the cofactor 
 th is generally considered to be the rate‐limiting enzyme in the pathway of catecholamine biosynthesis, and its activity is regulated (activated)  in vitro  and  in vivo  by phosphorylation at multiple serine residues in the regulatory domain which,  in vivo , involves distinct signaling pathways (reviewed in [ [ 34 ] ]). furthermore, th is subject  in vitro  to feedback inhibition by catecholamines, which bind to the active site and compete with h 4 biopterin [ [ 23 ] ], but the physiological significance of this inhibition is not fully understood [ [ 35 ] ]. the present study has demonstrated that a third mechanism operates at least  in vitro , i.e. a cooperative binding of the pterin cofactor modulated by phosphorylation of the enzyme ( table 1 ). negative cooperativity in ligand binding is a rare phenomenon occurring in very few enzyme systems [ [ 24 ] ]. it represents, however, a potentially important mechanism for the physiological regulation of th‐activity and catecholamine biosynthesis in neuroendocrine cells. thus, in contrast to the structurally and functionally homologous catabolic enzyme  xxxg1660xxx , which demonstrates a positive cooperativity of  l ‐phe binding/activation [ [ 36 ] ], the negative cooperativity of h 4 biopterin binding to th may create an efficient way to regulate catecholamine biosynthesis in response to changes in the cofactor concentration within a narrow, low micromolar range, corresponding to the estimated concentrations in catecholaminergic neuroendocrine cells ( table 2 ). thus, independent measurements of the total biopterin (mainly h 4 biopterin) concentration in the basal ganglia of rats and humans have given values in the range of 0.26–1.25 mug·g −1  wet weight (1.1–5.2 nmol·g −1  wet weight) ( table 2 ). although it is difficult to convert such numbers to intraneuronal concentrations [ [ 42 ] ], it is generally considered that the concentration of h 4 biopterin is limited relative to the concentration required for half‐maximal activity of th and tryptophan hydroxylase [ [ 38 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] ]. the concentration of the pterin cofactor is suboptimal within dopamine neurons because intracerebroventricular injection of h 4 biopterin increases the biosynthesis of  l ‐dopa by 100–240% [ [ 40 ] , [ 45 ] ]. thus, the negative cooperativity observed for human and bovine th with respect to high affinity pterin cofactor binding  in vitro  favours the regulation of dopamine biosynthesis by changes in h 4 biopterin concentration in the low micromolar concentration range, with a [ s ] 0.5 ‐value of 23 mu m  and 10.5 mu m  for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated hth1, respectively ( fig. 2  and  table 1 ). such a regulatory mechanism is particularly relevant in dopaminergic neurons of the basal ganglia (for review, see [ [ 46 ] ]). in patients with the dominant form of  l ‐dopa responsive dystonia, due to mutations in the gtp‐cyclohydrolase i (gtpch i) gene, a deficiency of h 4 biopterin within dopaminergic neurons explains the clinical symptoms from the basal ganglia, i.e. the difficulty in carrying out voluntary motoric activity. recent studies in rats [ [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] ] may offer an explanation for this selective dysfunction. thus, quantitative  in‐situ  hybridization studies on the distribution of gtpch i mrna within the rat brain have shown that dopamine neurons by far contain the lowest levels of transcripts [ [ 47 ] ]. furthermore, quantitative immunofluorescence studies indicate that heterogeneity of gtpch i protein expression is even greater than that of the mrna, with 7.3‐fold more of the protein in serotonin neurons than in dopamine neurons of substantia nigra [ [ 48 ] ]. nigrostriatal dopamine neurons thus appear to synthesize and maintain h 4 biopterin at low levels which may play an important role in the regulation of dopamine biosynthesis, notably in patients with l‐dopa responsive dystonia [ [ 46 ] ].
