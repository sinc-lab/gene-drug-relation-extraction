abstract
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide, a by-product of the carboxylation of blood coagulation factors, is reduced to  xxxd3522xxx  by
an enzymatic system possessing  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) activity. this system is the target of
coumarin-derived drugs widely used in thrombosis therapy and prophylaxis. recently, the key protein of the
 xxxg2418xxx  system has been identified. the human  xxxg2418xxx  gene maps to chromosome 16 and consists of 3 exons
encoding a 163-amino acid integral er membrane protein with three or four predicted transmembrane helices. expression of human  xxxg2418xxx  in spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells and in pichia pastoris results in
enhanced  xxxg2418xxx  activity over low endogenous constitutive levels. sequence based search methods reveal that
human  xxxg2418xxx  belongs to a large family of homologous genes found in vertebrates, insects, plants, protists,
archea, and bacteria. all orthologs share five completely conserved amino acids, including two cysteines
found in a tetrapeptide motif presumably required for redox function. the recent discovery of the  xxxg2418xxx 
gene has initiated renewed interest in understanding  xxxg2418xxx  activity. analysis of  xxxg2418xxx  protein structure
and function will be crucial in understanding the  xxxg2418xxx  catalytic mechanism, how anticoagulant drugs modulate  xxxg2418xxx  activity, and the role of  xxxg2418xxx  in downstream physiological and pathological pathways. antioxid. redox signal. 8, 347–353.

introduction

i

n 1929, henrik dam published the first detailed observations of  xxxd3522xxx  deficit symptoms as a result of studying
cholesterol metabolism in chickens fed fat-extracted diets
(10). although he was not yet aware of what caused the symptoms, including subcutaneous and internal hemorrhage, development of crooked bones, markedly prolonged coagulation times, and early death, he insightfully suggested that
poor development in affected animals was likely due to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. having ruled out scurvy and
calcium deficiency as the cause of the symptoms induced by
the fat-extracted diet (11), dam turned his research focus to

identifying the causative factors of the new dietary deficiency
disease (13). in 1935, he published a milestone report in
which, after having excluded the absence of any known fatsoluble vitamins (a, d, and e) as possible cause of the disease, he concluded that the substance whose absence in the
diet was responsible for the coagulation and bone growth pathologies should be a new fat-soluble vitamin he named  xxxd3522xxx  (from the danish and german words koagulation)
(12). for the discovery of  xxxd3522xxx , dam was awarded the
nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1943, together with
edward doisy for the purification, characterization, and synthesis of the vitamin. after that, quite some time passed until
the first light was shed on the biochemical pathways requir-

ing  xxxd3522xxx  and, ultimately, the target proteins upon which
it acts.
eventually, it was found that a number of clotting factors
present in blood plasma require  xxxd3522xxx  for their activation
(reviewed in ref. 45). the enzyme system responsible for
activating the clotting factors effects a post-translational
-carboxylation of glutamate residues (18), while abstracting
electrons from  xxxd3522xxx  to produce the oxidized form,  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide.
earlier, the oxidized epoxide form of  xxxd3522xxx  had been
discovered in metabolic labelling experiments in rats (31) and
elucidating its role in -carboxylation was pursued. it was also
noted that administration of warfarin, an anticoagulant drug
developed around 1943, caused an increase in the level of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide by blocking enzymatic  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) activity in the liver (2, 3). hepatic coagulation factors ii, vii, ix, and x, as well as protein c,  xxxg1850xxx ,
and protein z were shown to be -carboxylated at several
amino terminal glutamyl residues in a  xxxd3522xxx  dependent
process (18). in 1978, chick osteocalcin (also referred to as
 xxxg260xxx ) was found to be the first  xxxd3522xxx  dependent -carboxylated protein not involved in blood coagulation
(22). since then, several other -carboxylated proteins have
been discovered in key positions of physiological processes.
examples include matrix gla protein (bone metabolism) (37),
growth arrest protein  xxxg864xxx  (cell growth and survival) (30), various receptor  xxxg2198xxx  ligand proteins (apoptosis and
cell survival) (43), connexin26 and connexin32 (members of
the gap junction family of proteins that facilitate direct intercellular signaling and homeostasis) (28), and four putative

oldenburg et al.
transmembrane proteins of unknown function including
prgp1, prgp2 (24), tmg3, and tmg4 (25).
in humans and animals,  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide, resulting from
the -carboxylation of  xxxd3522xxx  dependent proteins, is reduced to  xxxd3522xxx  by the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase
( xxxg2418xxx ) system. the reduced  xxxd3522xxx  serves as a cofactor
in the -glutamyl carboxylase ( xxxg870xxx   xxxg886xxx )-mediated carboxylation reaction. the carboxylation process begins with the abstraction of hydrogen from glutamyl residues (glu). this generates a carbanion that can incorporate co2, resulting in
-carboxylated glu (abbreviated as gla). simultaneously,  xxxd3522xxx  is oxidized to  xxxd3522xxx  2,3- epoxide (17, 35). due to
the limited availability of  xxxd3522xxx  in tissues in vivo, the
epoxide must be rapidly reduced again to  xxxd3522xxx  in what is
known as the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle (6) (fig. 1). it was also recognized that administration of anticoagulant drugs including
warfarin and  xxxd2911xxx  led to a significant accumulation of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide. although it was initially believed
that the epoxide was merely a degradation product of vitamin
k, it was soon hypothesized that the epoxide is reconverted to
 xxxd3522xxx  by a warfarin-sensitive enzymatic reaction (31).
the action of coumarin derivatives gained worldwide recognition through use as the first oral anticoagulant drug for the
treatment of human thromboembolic disorders as well as for
use as a potent rodenticide. in humans, problematic and sometimes fatal bleeding represents a serious complication during
oral anticoagulant therapy (33, 48). among wild rodent populations where coumarin derivatives have been used for pest
control, at least eight independent natural point mutations in
 xxxg2418xxx  have resulted in anticoagulant resistance (34).

fig. 1. the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle. vitamin kdependent -carboxylase uses reduced  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone (kh2), carbon dioxide,
and oxygen as cofactors to -carboxylate  xxxd2431xxx  side chains in various vitamin kdependent proteins.  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide (ko)
is generated as a by-product and, due to the
overall scarcity of  xxxd3522xxx  in cells, must be
rapidly recycled to kh2 to sustain further carboxylation reactions. coumarin-derived
anticoagulants such as warfarin or  xxxd2911xxx  block recycling of ko by inhibiting
the two dithiol-dependent steps putatively performed by  xxxg2418xxx . nadph-dependent  xxxd3522xxx  reductase, formerly known as  xxxg1592xxx , can also reduce  xxxd3522xxx  quinone
to the fully reduced kh2, but is not capable of
reducing ko. thus,  xxxg2418xxx  is the only enzyme that has been shown to catalyze ko deepoxidation.

identification of the  xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) gene
since the first direct evidence of  xxxg2418xxx  activity was published in 1970 (2), all attempts to purify the membrane associated enzyme system have failed (1, 7, 26, 32, 52). the repeated failure in purifying proteins exhibiting  xxxg2418xxx  activity
led to the assumption that the putative  xxxg2418xxx  enzyme complex was very labile and sensitive to detergent treatment. additionally, some experiments provided evidence that the
 xxxg2418xxx  system may be a multiprotein complex consisting of
at least a member of the glutathione-s-transferase family and
a microsomal epoxide hydrolase that is closely associated
with -glutamyl carboxylase (7). furthermore, calumenin, an
endoplasmic reticulum-localized chaperone, had been shown
to partially inhibit  xxxg2418xxx  activity, suggesting a direct interaction with the  xxxg2418xxx  complex (53).
more recently, two independent genetic approaches have
both identified a single protein that forms an essential component of the putative  xxxg2418xxx  complex. our group chose the
classical approach of positional cloning in order to identify
candidate proteins that display warfarin-sensitive  xxxg2418xxx  activity. first, we mapped the locus for a rare human disorder,
combined  xxxd3522xxx -dependent clotting factor deficiency
type 2 ( xxxg2418xxx , omim #607473), to a 20 mb region on
chromosome 16p12-q21 (16). this region is orthologous to a
previously mapped locus for warfarin resistance in the rat
genome on chromosome 1 and on chromosome 7 in mice (21,
23, 51). pursuing the hypothesis that allelic mutations in the
orthologous gene could cause warfarin resistance in rodents
and man (omim #122700), as well as cause  xxxg2418xxx , we
narrowed the search to a 4 mb region on the short arm of
human chromosome 16.
the annotated human genome available in the ensembl
database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ensembl/) revealed some 129
putative genes distributed across approximately 1100 exons
mapped to this region. using dna from two diagnosed
 xxxg2418xxx  patients and from four warfarin resistant probands,
we systematically screened genes in this region and found putative mutations in a gene of unknown function. this gene extended over 5126 base pairs and comprised three exons encoding a protein of 163 amino acids with a calculated relative
molecular mass of about 18 kda ([41]). we named this gene
 xxxg2418xxx ( xxxg2418xxx ),
as recombinant overexpression of the respective cdna in
hek293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells with little endogenous  xxxg2418xxx  activity, an immortalized cell line created
by transformation with adenovirus) resulted in robust  xxxg2418xxx 
activity as assessed by a standard in vitro  xxxg2418xxx  activity
assay (54). the activity of the overexpressed wild type protein was inhibited by warfarin.
furthermore, recombinant expression of warfarin-resistant
rat  xxxg2418xxx  mutants in hek293 cells resulted in reduced
 xxxg2418xxx  activity, relative to wild-type rat  xxxg2418xxx , along with
resistance to warfarin inhibition. expression of  xxxg2418xxx 
mutant proteins identical to those found in patients suffering
from  xxxg2418xxx  almost completely abolished  xxxg2418xxx  activity.
this proved the expected functional correlation of  xxxg2418xxx  ac-

349
tivity, warfarin resistance, and  xxxg2418xxx  disease phenotype
with  xxxg2418xxx  expression. additionally, northern blot analysis revealed highest levels of  xxxg2418xxx  expression in fetal
and adult liver, with lesser amounts expressed in fetal heart,
kidney, lung, and in adult heart and pancreas.
independently, the laboratory of darrel w. stafford identified the  xxxg2418xxx  gene by an alternative approach (27). starting from published data on  xxxg2418xxx  in human and warfarin
resistance in rat, the same region of human chromosome 16
was analyzed. considering that  xxxg2418xxx  activity is a membrane-bound process, they identified just 13 candidate genes
for membrane proteins of unknown function in the critical
chromosome segment. the stafford lab’s strategy was to perform sirna knockdown experiments for each of the 13 gene
candidates in a cell system (a549 cultured cells) with high
intrinsic  xxxg2418xxx  activity in order to identify the gene. several
different interference rnas were synthesized for each of the
target genes. knockdown of only one gene resulted in significant reduction of  xxxg2418xxx  activity. the putative  xxxg2418xxx  gene
was cloned and heterologously overexpressed in insect cells
to confirm  xxxg2418xxx  function and warfarin sensitivity. this is
the first time a mammalian gene has been identified using the
sirna gene knockdown approach (42).
examining available sequences from the human, rat, and
mouse genomes, highly conserved homologs and orthologs,
as well as pseudogenes, were identified (27, 41). orthologs
have now been identified in xenopus, drosophila, anopheles,
bacteria, protists, and plants (20, 27, 39, 41). the unexpected
high level of sequence identity across these species points toward an important, and likely ancient, conserved function. in
vertebrates,  xxxg2418xxx  activity is closely coupled to  xxxd3522xxx 
recycling in -carboxylation. in protist and plant genomes,
searches for the complementary carboxylase sequences, that
would indicate the presence of  xxxd3522xxx  cycling, revealed no
homologs. this finding suggests that  xxxg2418xxx , and  xxxg2418xxx 
activity, likely arose very early in the development of cellular
life and may fulfil another function not directly related to carboxylation of proteins (39).

 xxxg2418xxx  protein structure
and function
from biochemical studies it is well known that  xxxg2418xxx  activity copurifies with the microsomal membrane fractions
from liver and kidney (15, 52) and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of mammalian cells (7). these results have been confirmed by more recent studies using gfpand myc- tagged  xxxg2418xxx -cdna constructs and antibodies
against the er specific protein  xxxg334xxx , demonstrating
 xxxg2418xxx  localization in the meshlike structures of the er
(41).
with a calculated isoelectric point of 10.73 and extremely
high hydrophobicity (gravy hydrophobicity index =
0.546012, calculated using the sosui algorithm, gravy =
grand average of hydropathicity; http://sosui.proteome.bio.

ogy prediction algorithms propose between one and five
transmembrane domains (depending on the program used)
(20, 47). recent data strongly suggest a three-transmembrane
topology from in vitro translation/cotranslocation experiments (47). the suggested structure can be described as follows: er-lumenal n-terminus (~10 aa), 3 trans-membrane helices bracketing one large cytoplasmic loop (~69 aa)
between the first and second transmembrane helices and a
small er-lumenal loop (~7 aa) between the second and third
helices, and a cytoplasmic c-terminus (~16 aa) (fig. 2).
alignments of amino acid sequences of  xxxg2418xxx  orthologs indicate several conserved amino acids and functional motives (20, 27, 41). two absolutely conserved cysteine residues (cys43 and cys51 in human  xxxg2418xxx )
together with a conserved serine/threonine (ser57) are located within the cytoplasmic loop (20, 47). two additional
conserved cysteines (cys132 and cys135) predicted to be
partially buried in the er membrane form a possible civc
redox motif (20, 40) (fig. 2). these five conserved polar
residues have been proposed to form the active center of
 xxxg2418xxx  (20). none of the conserved residues are found to
be naturally mutated in humans or rodents. in vitro mutagenesis of cys132 or cys135 to serine completely eliminates
 xxxg2418xxx  activity, confirming that the civc redox motif plays a
crucial role in  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction (50). conserved
throughout all species investigated, cysteine residues 43 and
51 and the redox motive confirm previous observations that
 xxxg2418xxx  activity is dependent on external reducing agents (46).
interestingly, in some plant  xxxg2418xxx  orthologs as well as in
those of cyanobacteria and bacteria, c- or n-terminal fusion
with thioredoxin-like (trx) protein domains or with thioldisulfide interchange protein-like domains (dsba) is observed. these fusion proteins suggest the possible involvement of trx-like proteins as biological reducing partners for
 xxxg2418xxx . as cytoplasmic trx seems not to directly provide

oldenburg et al.
reducing equivalents for  xxxg2418xxx  (36), protein disulfide isomerases appear to be candidates for providing reducing
equivalents that sustain  xxxg2418xxx  activity (44). as both warfarin
and  xxxd3522xxx  are known to partition into the lipid bilayer of
the cell membrane, the predicted location of the redox motif
and the warfarin binding motif (tya motif, fig. 2) within a
hydrophobic transmembrane domain is consistent with the intramembrane distribution of both the enzyme’s substrate and
inhibitor, respectively (55).
inhibition of  xxxg2418xxx  activity by coumarin derivatives, including warfarin, is the most commonly used approach to
anticoagulant therapy world-wide. recently, the 18 kda protein  xxxg2418xxx  was identified as a warfarin-sensitive vitamin
k epoxide reductase (27, 41). yet, there are other known
warfarin-sensitive reductases, such as  xxxg521xxx  (nqor, previously referred to as  xxxg1592xxx ; 14),
that are capable of reducing oxidized  xxxd3522xxx  quinone to
the reduced hydroquinone form required as a cofactor for
-carboxylation of clotting factors. however, none of these
other warfarin-sensitive enzymes is capable of converting  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide to the more reduced forms (quinone or hydroquinone) of  xxxd3522xxx . furthermore,  xxxg2418xxx  possesses
a hydrophobic sequence motif, thr-tyr-ala (tya), identified
by photoaffinity labelling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments as essential for  xxxd1875xxx  binding in rat liver
nqor (29). recently, pelz et al. (34) demonstrated that several different mutations in rat  xxxg2418xxx  at residue y139 produce warfarin-resistant phenotypes, suggesting that the tya
motif forms at least part of the binding site for coumarins in
 xxxg2418xxx . interestingly, this sequence is found just adjacent
to the civc redox motif. the physical adjacency of structural
elements important for  xxxg2418xxx  warfarin binding and  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction suggests possible mechanisms for
warfarin inhibition of  xxxg2418xxx  activity. high resolution structural data will likely be required to discern the actual mecha-

fig. 2. proposed membrane topology of  xxxg2418xxx  according to tie et
al. (47).
the model predicts three
transmembrane -helices. the amino
terminus (10 aa) of the enzyme is located in the er lumen, followed by helix 1 (aa 11–30), a large cytoplasmic
loop comprising 69 aa, -helix 2 (aa
101–120), a small er lumenal loop of 7
amino acids, -helix 3 (aa 128–147),
and finally a 16 aa carboxy terminus located in the cytoplasm. various hatchings are used to indicate amino acids
belonging to five completely conserved
residues (cys 43, cys51, ser/thr57,
cys132, cys135), the proposed warfarin binding motif (tya, aa 138–140),
the proposed redox motif (civc, aa
132–135), and a proposed er retention
signal motif (aa 159–163).

nism from among the possibilities and such data can now be
obtained through large-scale production of  xxxg2418xxx  using
heterologous expression systems (38).

 xxxg2418xxx -complex structure
for a long time, it has been a generally accepted model
that a membrane-bound multienzyme complex is required to
perform the reaction steps of complete  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction (7, 8). a microsomal epoxide hydrolase and a
membrane-bound member of the glutathione-s-transferase
family, as well as calumenin have been proposed to be members of this complex (7, 8, 49, 53). in contrast to these previous studies,  xxxg2418xxx  appears not to require association with
other proteins for its primary function. recombinant expression of  xxxg2418xxx  in spodoptera frugiperda cells (sf9), which
possess undetectable constitutive  xxxg2418xxx  activity, elevates  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide recycling to high levels (27). however, we
cannot exclude the possibility that endogenous cofactors or
coenzymes required for  xxxd3522xxx  recycling are present in
sf9 cells and, together with heterologously expressed
 xxxg2418xxx , reconstitute a functional, albeit non-native, complex capable of reducing  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide.
similarly, the observation that heterologous expression of
 xxxg2418xxx  in  xxxd3522xxx  recycling-deficient cells of the
methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris results in measurable
 xxxg2418xxx  activity (our unpublished results) suggests that the
presence of  xxxg2418xxx  is necessary, if not sufficient, to reduce
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide.
in another recent study focusing on the -carboxylase,
 xxxg870xxx   xxxg886xxx  , wajih et al. used an engineered recombinant expression system to demonstrate that  xxxg2418xxx -dependent  xxxg2418xxx 
activity is the rate-limiting step for -carboxylation (50). due
to the oxidative environment in the er lumen,  xxxg2418xxx  and
 xxxg870xxx   xxxg886xxx  likely reside in close proximity in order to limit oxidation of nascent recycled  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone. however, it
does not appear that  xxxg2418xxx  and  xxxg870xxx   xxxg886xxx  form a stable complex, as the two enzymes can be easily separated by mild
chromatographic methods (7).

conclusion
cloning of  xxxg2418xxx , the rate-limiting enzyme of vitamin
k recycling, has elucidated the molecular basis of  xxxg2418xxx ,
a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder, and of warfarin
resistance in man and rodents (34, 41). further structural and
functional characterization of the protein will be crucial for
understanding the mechanism of the redox reaction in  xxxg2418xxx 
and its inhibition by warfarin. this may lead to the design of
more potent and less harmful coumarin derivatives for use in
anticoagulant therapy in humans.
unexpectedly, recent reports have opened a much wider
perspective on realizing near-term improvements in the therapeutic application of existing anticoagulants. several independently conducted studies have explained the basis for
interindividual and interethnic differences in therapeutic re-

sponse to coumarin drugs based on common genetic variants
that may modulate  xxxg2418xxx  activity through altered levels of
protein production (5, 9, 19, 48). moreover, we are tempted to
speculate that naturally occurring  xxxg2418xxx  gene variants
(i.e., variants encompassing mutations in nontranslated regions of the gene) may also have important influence on
downstream function of  xxxd3522xxx  dependent proteins, including matrix gla protein and osteocalcin, which have been
suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke (4).
