abstract:  xxxg2099xxx  proteins are targets for many psychoactive compounds, including therapeutic and
abused stimulant drugs. this paper reviews recent work from our laboratory investigating the interaction of stimulants
with transporters in brain tissue. we illustrate how determining the precise mechanism of stimulant drug action (uptake
inhibitor vs. substrate) can provide unique opportunities for medication discovery. an important lesson learned from this
work is that drugs which display equipotent substrate activity at dopamine (da) and serotonin (5-ht) transporters have
minimal abuse liability and few stimulant side-effects, yet are able to suppress ongoing drug-seeking behavior. as a
specific example, we describe the development of pal-287 (alpha-methylnapthylethylamine), a dual da/5-ht releasing
agent that suppresses cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys, without the adverse effects associated with older
phenylethylamine 5-ht releasers (e.g., fenfluramine) and da releasers (e.g., amphetamine). our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of developing non-amphetamine releasing agents as potential treatments for substance abuse disorders and
other psychiatric conditions.

psychomotor stimulants

table 1.

psychomotor stimulants are drugs that produce a spectrum of effects in humans characterized by cardiovascular
activation, increased energy and mood elevation. after high
doses or extended periods of use, stimulants can induce a
range of disordered thought processes, including severe
psychotic episodes. in laboratory animals, stimulants produce
hyperactivity and support self-administration behavior,
effects that are mediated by increases in extracellular
dopamine (da) in mesolimbic reward circuits (da) [1]. the
effects of stimulants are often described as “amphetaminelike” since amphetamine is the prototypical stimulant agent.
table 1 shows some examples of stimulants. many of these
drugs are medications with long histories of efficacy and
safety, whereas others are highly addictive substances
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. in some
cases, as with amphetamine itself, the same drug can be
therapeutic or abused depending upon the context in which
the drug is administered. indeed, the route of administration
can play a crucial role in determining the addictive potential
stimulants, since a slower rate of drug action is associated
with diminished reinforcing strength [2, 3].
most stimulants exert their pharmacological effects by
interacting with  xxxg2099xxx  proteins expressed
on various cell types. nerve cells that synthesize, store,
release and metabolize monoamine transmitters [da, norepinephrine (ne) and serotonin (5-ht)] are widely
distributed in the mammalian cns. these cells display
specialized membrane proteins that transport previously
released transmitter from the extracellular space back into
the cytoplasm [4, 5]. distinct transporter proteins are

expressed on ne neurons (i.e., ne transporters,  xxxg2148xxx ), da
neurons (i.e., da transporters, dat), and 5-ht neurons
(i.e., 5-ht transporters, sert). these proteins belong to a
superfamily of na+/cl- dependent transporters that share
genetic, structural, and functional homologies [6, 7]. under
normal circumstances, the transporter-mediated uptake of
amine transmitters is the principal mechanism for inactivation of monoamine signaling in the brain. accordingly,
stimulants that interact with monoamine transporters can
have profound effects on normal neurotransmission [8]. it is
important to note that certain stimulant drugs, especially
substituted amphetamines, interact with other neuronal

proteins such as  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) [9] and the
vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  type 2 (vmat2) [10].
stimulants that target transporter proteins can be divided
into two classes based on their precise molecular mechanism
of action - reuptake inhibitors and substrate-type releasers.
reuptake inhibitors (e.g., methylphenidate and cocaine) bind
to transporter proteins but are not transported. these drugs
elevate extracellular transmitter concentrations by blocking
transporter-mediated recapture of transmitters from the
synapse. substrate-type releasers (e.g., amphetamines) also
bind to transporter proteins, and these drugs are subsequently
transported into the neuronal cytoplasm where they evoke
non-exocytotic transmitter release. releasers elevate
extracellular transmitter concentrations by a two-pronged
mechanism: (1) they promote efflux of transmitter by
reversing the normal direction of transporter flux and (2)
they increase free cytoplasmic levels of transmitter by
interacting with vmat2 to disrupt vesicular storage [11, 12].
the precise underpinnings of transporter-mediated release
involve complex processes that are the topic of intensive
investigation [13-15]. because substrate-type releasing
agents must be transported into nerve terminals to promote
transmitter release, reuptake inhibitors can block the effects
of releasers. in some cases, drugs can act as allosteric
modulators of transporter function [16-20].
for more than a decade, we have carried out experiments
investigating the interaction of psychostimulants with
monoamine transporters in order to understand how these
drugs affect the brain. it is anticipated that the knowledge
gained from these studies will aid in the development of
pharmacotherapies for treating stimulant dependence and
other psychiatric disorders [21]. specific aspects of our work
have been recently reviewed [22-25]. in the present paper,
we illustrate how determining the mechanism of action of a
wide range of transporter ligands (uptake inhibitor vs.
substrate) can provide unique opportunities for medication
development.
transporter mechanisms
as noted above, stimulants can be classified as either
uptake inhibitors or releasers based on their molecular

rothman and baumann

mechanism of action. both types of agents increase synaptic
concentrations of transmitter via transporter-dependent
processes, and there are important differences in their modes
of action at the cellular and organismic level. in particular,
the activity of reuptake inhibitors requires ongoing release of
transmitters via exocytosis – a cellular mechanism directly
dependent upon electrical depolarization and extracellular
calcium. thus, the ability of reuptake inhibitors to increase
synaptic transmitter levels is described as being impulse- and
calcium-dependent. substrates, on the other hand, increase
synaptic transmitter levels by a process that is largely
independent of ongoing cell firing and exocytotic transmitter
release. plasma membrane autoreceptors mediate negative
feedback mechanisms that serve to dampen the ability of
reuptake inhibitors to elevate synaptic transmitter [26]. such
negative feedback effects exist for 5-ht [27-29], da [30],
and ne [31] neuronal systems. while autoreceptor activation
can abolish the ability of reuptake inhibitors to elevate
synaptic transmitter levels, autoreceptor mechanisms have
little or no effect on substrate-induced neurotransmitter
release [32-36]. because of autoreceptor-mediated feedback
inhibition, reuptake inhibitors tend to produce small
increases in extracellular neurotransmitter whereas releasers
tend to produce more robust increases [37]. the in vivo
microdialysis data in fig. 1 illustrate the modest and
sustained elevation of extracellular 5-ht evoked by the 5ht reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, compared to the much
larger and transient effect of the 5-ht releaser, (+)fenfluramine [33, 38, 39].
given the important distinctions between uptake inhibitors and releasers, we sought to develop assays which could
easily determine if test drugs interacted with transporters as
inhibitors or substrates. this work served to identify the
mechanism of action of known stimulant-type agents [40-43]
and to guide the synthesis and evaluation of novel treatment
agents for addictive disorders [21]. traditionally, it has been
difficult to use simple test tube assays to discriminate
between drugs that are uptake inhibitors vs. those that are
substrate-type releasers [8, 11]. thus we spent considerable
time and effort in developing a rapid high-throughput
method for measuring the release of preloaded [3h]da,

fig. (1). effects of fluoxetine (a 5-ht reuptake inhibitor) and (+)-fenfluramine (a 5-ht releaser) on extracellular 5-ht in rat nucleus

expressed as a percentage of the mean of three basal dialysate samples collected prior to drug treatment. basal dialysate 5-ht level was 0.46
± 0.17 nm. values are mean ± sem for n=5 rats/group.

[3h]ne and [ 3h]5-ht from nervous tissue in vitro [44]. the
basic strategy employed in the release assay is to first
incubate synaptosomes with [3h]neurotransmitter for
sufficient time to achieve steady state. at steady state, test
drugs are added to synaptosomes and the reaction is
terminated by rapid filtration after 5 min. transmitter
“release” is quantified by measuring the amount of tritium
retained on the filter – decreases in retained tritium reflect
increases in [3h]neurotransmitter released. a key
requirement of our release assay is the inclusion of reserpine
in the assay buffer; reserpine prevents accumulation of
neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles thereby maximizing
the amount of preloaded [3h]neurotransmitter available for
substrate-induced release.
the activity of transporter substrates can be readily
distinguished from that of transporter blockers using our in
vitro release assay. as depicted in fig. 2, the non-selective
uptake inhibitor indatraline, which has high affinity for
dat,  xxxg2148xxx  and sert, displays very weak activity in release
assays. by contrast, the transporter substrate, methamphetamine, causes dose-dependent release of [3h]da, [3h]ne
and [3h]5-ht. methamphetamine is much more potent at
releasing da and ne when compared to its effects on 5-ht,
consistent with the known pharmacology of this drug [40,
44]. the data in fig. 3 demonstrate that low concentrations
of indatraline antagonize methamphetamine-induced release
of [3h]da, shifting the methamphetamine release curve to
the right. thus, indatraline blocks the da-releasing activity
of methamphetamine by binding to dat sites in the tissue.
the apparent ki value for indatraline (~2 nm) calculated
from the shift of the methamphetamine release curve is
similar to its ki value for inhibition of [3h]da uptake (1.9
nm). in more recent studies, we have employed [3h]1methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3h]mpp+) as a radiolabeled
substrate for dat and  xxxg2148xxx  assays. [3h]mpp+ yields results
comparable to the endogenous substrates da and ne, with
an improved signal-to-noise ratio [43]. the collective
findings illustrate that our assay systems can readily
discriminate releasers from uptake blockers. moreover, the
assays can be used to evaluate the pharmacological profile of

fig. (3). effects of indatraline (5 nm and 25 nm) on
methamphetamine-evoked release of [3h]dopamine. each point is

test drugs at all three monoamine transporters under similar
experimental conditions. table 2 reports the results obtained
with a wide range of pharmacological agents using these
assays. although the results are discussed in detail in the
individual papers cited in table 2, we highlight important
findings here.
appetite suppressants
figure 4 shows that many clinically available appetite
suppressants are phenylethylamines structurally related to
amphetamine. not surprisingly, these drugs share behavioral
properties with abused stimulants but are typically less
potent and less addictive [45-48]. preclinical studies have
shown that amphetamine-type appetite suppressants decrease
cocaine and methamphetamine self-administration in various
animal species [49-53]. thus, we believed that clinically
available appetite suppressants, such as phentermine, diethylpropion, and phendimetrazine, might be logical candi-

dates for the pharmacotherapy of stimulant dependence [54].
we have performed experiments to examine the molecular
mechanisms associated with anorectic drugs.
phentermine is one of the more widely prescribed
appetite suppressant medications. in vitro studies (table 2)
reveal that phentermine is a substrate at  xxxg2148xxx , dat and
sert, with its most potent action being ne release (ec50 =
39 nm). while the administration of phentermine to rats
evokes da release in the brain [55], the in vitro data suggest
that phentermine might increase ne release at much lower
doses than those required to release da. the same holds true
for (±)-ephedrine, which is at least 10-times more potent at
releasing ne than da. (+)-amphetamine, in contrast, is only
3-times more potent at ne release than da release.

unfortunately, to our knowledge, a dose-response comparison of the ne- and da-releasing effects of these stimulants
has not been directly determined using in vivo microdialysis
methods in rats.
to help clarify this issue, a recent study was conducted in
baboons to compare the effects of phentermine, (±)ephedrine and (+)-amphetamine in vivo [56]. following
administration of high (1.5 mg/kg) iv doses of the drugs to
anesthetized baboons, both dopaminergic (central da release
and plasma prolactin) and noradrenergic (plasma ne)
endpoints were measured. central da release was
determined via positron emission tomography using the
method of [ 11c]raclopride displacement. as shown in figs. 5
and 6, only (+)-amphetamine decreases plasma prolactin and

increases central da release as indicated by reductions in the
binding potential of [11c]raclopride. in contrast, all three
stimulants increase plasma ne and da (fig. 7). given that
plasma da levels are about 10-fold less than plasma ne
levels, and da is a precursor in ne biosynthesis, we believe
that these stimulants release both ne and da from
peripheral noradrenergic nerves. the plasma levels of the
various drugs tested in baboons were at the high end of
typical therapeutic plasma levels observed in human subjects
(1-3 µm) [57, 58]. these data suggest, therefore, that typical
clinical doses of phentermine and (±)-ephedrine may not
release central da in humans. both phentermine [59] and
(±)-ephedrine [60, 61] produce amphetamine-like subjective
effects in humans, and the ec50 values of stimulants to
release ne, but not da, correlate with the oral doses that
produce amphetamine-type subjective effects (fig. 8) [40].
viewed collectively these data support the hypothesis that

stimulant-induced increases in ne contribute to the acute
subjective effects of amphetamine-like agents. more studies
are needed to determine the role of ne in mediating effects
of psychomotor stimulants.
diethylpropion and phendimetrazine are clinically
available anorectic agents that display minimal interactions
with monoamine transporters in vitro (table 2). on the other
hand, these medications are known to be psychomotor
stimulants when administered in vivo as indicated by their
shared properties with illicit drugs like cocaine. for example,
diethylpropion and phendimetrazine are self-administered by
animals [45, 62], and both drugs exhibit discriminative
stimulus properties that generalize to cocaine [47, 48]. one
hypothesis consistent with the available data is that
diethylpropion and phendimetrazine are “prodrugs” which
are converted to bioactive metabolites upon systemic
administration. in the case of diethylpropion, the n-deethyla-

ted metabolite, n-ethylaminopropiophenone, appears to be
the bioactive metabolite since this compound potently
releases ne (ec50 = 99.3 nm) with less potent effects on 5ht release (ec50 = 2118 nm). interestingly, n-ethylaminopropiophenone is not a dat substrate, but instead
blocks da reuptake (ec50 = 1014 nm) [63]. in the case of
phendimetrazine, the n-demethylated metabolite  xxxd2907xxx  potently releases ne and da (table 2). stereochemistry plays an important role in the transporter activity
of (±)- xxxd2907xxx . while the clinically available transstereoisomer ((+)- xxxd2907xxx ) is a potent ne and da
releaser, the cis-stereoisomer ((-)- xxxd2907xxx ) is somewhat less active. a more intriguing finding is that enantiomers of (±)-pseudophenmetrazine display different molecular mechanisms at dat. specifically, (-)-pseudophenmetrazine is a da uptake inhibitor whereas (+)-pseudophenmetrazine is a dat substrate. to our knowledge, this represents
the first example of two enantiomers exhibiting differential
transporter mechanisms [41].
ephedrine-related compounds
ephedrine is a familiar and widely-used stimulant that
was once available in over-the-counter (otc) preparations.
table 3.

ephedrine has attracted unfavorable attention because of its
use as a synthetic precursor in the clandestine production of
methamphetamine [64], and due to its potential for toxicity
(including death) [65]. the compound is obtained as an
herbal extract derived from plants of the genus ephedra or as
a synthetic chemical. all forms of ephedrine have been
removed from the otc market due to the occurrence of
cardiovascular side-effects, but the synthetic chemical is still
available as a prescription product. current and past therapeutic applications of ephedrine include treatment of asthma
and use as a hypertensive agent, decongestant, central
stimulant, and anorectic agent.
ephedrine has a complex stereochemistry due to the
presence of two chiral centers. specifically, ephedrinerelated phenylpropanolamines can exist as four distinct
stereoisomers (see table 3 for chemical structures). [1r,2s](−)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropan-1-ol is typically identified as (−)-ephedrine, while [1s,2r]-(+)-2-(methylamino)-1phenylpropan-1-ol is typically identified as (+)-ephedrine.
[1r,2r]-(−)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropan-1-ol is (−)pseudoephedrine, and [1s,2s]-(+)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropan-1-ol is (+)-pseudoephedrine. n-demethylation
also results in four optical isomers: [1r,2s]-(−)-2-(amino)-1-

phenylpropan-1-ol, commonly termed (−)-norephedrine or
(−)-phenylpropanolamine, [1r,2s]-(−)-2-(amino)-1-phenylpropan-1-ol, commonly referred to as (+)-norephedrine or
(+)-phenylpropanolamine, (−)-norpseudoephedrine or (−)cathine, and (+)-norpseudoephedrine or (+)-cathine. table 3
shows how the structures of the phenylpropanolamines can
be related to those of the phenylisopropylamines (i.e.
phenylethylamines) methamphetamine and amphetamine.
the phenylpropanonamines methcathinone and cathinone
differ from methamphetamine and amphetamine with respect
to stereochemistry and the oxidation state of the benzylic
position. methamphetamine and amphetamine lack a
benzylic substituent, and s(−)-methcathinone and s(−)cathinone can be viewed as analogs of ephedrine and
norephedrine where the benzylic hydroxyl group has been
oxidized to the corresponding ketone.
ephedrine has been extensively studied for decades, but
the pharmacological activity of ephedrine-related phenylpropanolamines across a wide array of cns receptors and
transporters was not reported until our study published in
2003 [43]. the most potent action of ephedrine-like
phenylpropanolamines is substrate activity at  xxxg2148xxx . in
contrast, methcathinone, cathinone, methamphetamine and
amphetamine, release both ne and da. importantly, the
ephedrine-like phenylpropanolamines have much lower or
negligible affinity for adrenergic receptors, indicating that
the pharmacological effects of these agents most likely result
from the “indirect”  xxxg2148xxx -mediated release of ne. this latter
finding is unexpected, since pharmacology text books teach
that the phenylpropanolamines stimulate the sympathetic
nervous system by a variety of mechanisms that include
direct agonist activity at adrenergic receptors and “indirect”
effects via carrier-mediated exchange with ne [66].
adverse effects
the clinical utility of amphetamine-type anorectic agents
is limited by a number of adverse side-effects. cardiovascular complications and high abuse liability are
table 4.

established risks of prescribed  xxxg2148xxx  and dat substrates (e.g.
amphetamine). more recently, adverse effects associated
with the use sert substrates have been widely publicized;
these serious side-effects include cardiac valve disease
(cvd) and primary pulmonary hypertension (pph). (±)fenfluramine, and its more potent enantiomer (+)-fenfluramine, were once commonly prescribed anorectic agents.
these medications were removed from clinical use in 1997
due to the occurrence of cvd in some patients [67]. we
reported that fenfluramine, aminorex, and other amphetaminerelated drugs known to increase the risk for developing pph
(e.g., chlorphentermine) share the common feature of being
sert substrates [68]. our findings implicated sert in the
mechanism underlying fenfluramine-induced pph. it is
noteworthy that not all sert substrates are associated with
pph, and the specific role of sert proteins in this disease
likely involves a complex array of factors that requires further
study.
experimental data from a mouse model of hypoxic
pulmonary hypertension have suggested that 5-ht2b
receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of pph [69].
aminorex is a sert substrate that caused an epidemic of
pph in the 1960s [70] and case reports implicate the related
designer drug, 4-methylaminorex, as a potential cause of the
disease [71]. if 5-ht2b receptors are involved in the
pathogenesis of aminorex-associated pph, then we surmised
that aminorex should display activity at 5-ht2b sites. as
reported in table 4, aminorex activates the cloned human 5ht2b receptor with moderate potency and high efficacy
(emax = 76%). however, the ec50 of aminorex for 5-ht2b
receptor activation (870 nm) is 33-times higher than its ec50
for  xxxg2148xxx  release (26.4 nm). moreover, the activity of
aminorex at 5-ht2b sites is nearly 50-fold less than the
known 5-ht2b agonist (+)-norfenfluramine, the ndeethylated metabolite of (+)-fenfluramine. chlorphentermine is a substituted amphetamine analog that causes pph
in animal models. as shown in table 4, this drug has
negligible affinity for  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes. collectively,

the data argue against an important role for 5-ht2b receptors
in the pathogenesis of anorectic-associated pph. on the
other hand, it seems feasible that a metabolite of aminorex or
chlorphentermine may act more potently at 5-ht2b receptors, and this possibility deserves to be examined.
the evidence supporting a role for 5-ht2b receptors in
the pathogenesis of fenfluramine-associated cvd is much
stronger. as noted above, the association of fenfluramine
with an increased prevalence of cardiac valvulopathy led to
its withdrawal from the market place. numerous investigations have demonstrated that the fenfluramine metabolite,
norfenfluramine, activates 5-ht2b receptors on heart valves
to stimulate mitogensis, and this action may represent the
principal mechanism underlying fenfluramine-induced cvd
[72-74]. findings summarized by setola et al. [74]
emphasize that valvulopathic agents are “pro-drugs” in many
instances, since it is the bioactive metabolites which serve to
stimulate  xxxg1114xxx  sites. specific examples of this
pro-drug phenomenon are shown in fig. 9, where ndemethylated metabolites of mdma and  xxxd2621xxx  are
potent efficacious 5-ht2b agonists.

results in the formation of norfenfluramine, mda and
methylergonovine. these metabolites are  xxxg1114xxx  agonists
and are associated with cardiac valve disease. from [74].

as comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [75], certain
sert substrates, such as mdma and fenfluramine, produce
5-ht neurotoxicity. the term ‘5-ht neurotoxicity’, when
used in the present context, refers to the fact that high-dose
administration of 5-ht releasers often causes persistent
depletion of brain tissue 5-ht and 5-ht transporters. a key
observation is that not all sert substrates deplete 5-ht. for
example, repeated administration of the sert substrate mchlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) fails to deplete brain 5-ht,
despite producing elevations of extracellular 5-ht compar-

able to fenfluramine [76]. other examples of sert substrates that do not cause 5-ht neurotoxicity include the
tetralin and indan analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)
amphetamine (mda) reported by nichols et al. [77] and
pal-287, which is discussed in the next section. like
mcpp, pal-287 produces elevations in extracellular 5-ht
but does not produce long-term 5-ht depletion, even after
exposure to very high doses (i.e., 18 mg/kg, i.p. x 3). these
data indicate that sert substrate activity is necessary, but
not sufficient to produce long-term depletion of brain 5-ht.
pal-287 and related agents
along with other researchers, we have advocated the use
of amphetamine-type monoamine releasers as agonist therapies for cocaine dependence [54, 78]. similar to cocaine,
these compounds target monoamine transporters to elevate
synaptic levels of ne, da and 5-ht [8, 25]. preclinical
studies support the utility of amphetamines as agonist
treatments [49, 79]. for example, negus and mello [80]
demonstrated that slow infusion of the da releaser (+)amphetamine decreases cocaine self-administration behavior
in monkeys, with minimal effects on food-maintained
behavior. perhaps more importantly, grabowski et al. [81]
and shearer et al. [82] showed that (+)-amphetamine is an
effective treatment adjunct for reducing illicit cocaine use in
cocaine-dependent human patients. unfortunately, the use of
amphetamine as a medication is limited by at least two
problems. first, da releasers possess significant abuse
potential due to activation of mesolimbic da neurons in
reward pathways [83]. second, da releasers will not correct
5-ht deficits that accompany long-term cocaine abuse [84].
we have suggested the possibility of designing dual
da/5-ht releasers that can overcome both of the aforementioned limitations [85]. for example, a growing body of
evidence indicates that increases in 5-ht release can dampen
the effects of concurrent da release, suggesting that mixed
da/5-ht releasers would exhibit less stimulant side-effects.
to test whether the balance between da and 5-ht transmission can predict the occurrence of stimulant-like behaviors, we examined the neurochemical and locomotor effects
produced by a series of monoamine releasers that display
varying degrees of potency as dat and sert substrates.
the chemical structures of the drugs tested are shown in fig.
10; it should be noted that pal-313, pal-314, pal-303 and
pal-353 are ring-substituted amphetamines whereas pal287 is a non-amphetamine compound [21, 86].
table 5 summarizes in vitro potencies of test drugs as
releasers of [3h]da and [3h]5-ht. the da/5-ht ratio for
each drug was calculated by dividing the ec50 value for da
release by the corresponding value for 5-ht release. with
this method, ratios greater than 1 indicate increasing 5-ht
selectivity while ratios less than 1 indicate da selectivity.
all of the drugs are substrate-type releasers that cause efflux
of preloaded tritiated transmitter via transporter-mediated
mechanisms. the selectivity of drugs for da and 5-ht
transporters differs substantially. (+)-amphetamine has
much higher potency for da release when compared to 5ht release (da/5-ht ratio=0.005). the naphthalene
derivative pal-287 has 500-fold greater potency for 5-ht
release when compared to amphetamine, while effects on

fig. (10). chemical structures of (+)-amphetamine, pal-287, and
pal amphetamines.

da are comparable (da/5-ht ratio=3.706). the substituted
amphetamines, pal-313, -314, -303 and -353, display
roughly equivalent potency as ne and da releasers, but
these compounds have varying potencies as 5-ht releasers,
with pal-313 exhibiting highest potency and pal-353
exhibiting lowest potency.
we first compared the in vivo neurochemical and
behavioral effects of (+)-amphetamine and pal-287 in rats.
fig. 11 shows that i.v. administration of (+)-amphetamine
increases extracellular da in the prefrontal cortex, with
minimal effects on extracellular 5-ht. the microdialysis
data are consistent with in vitro release data demonstrating
(+)-amphetamine is a potent dat substrate (table 5). in

data taken from [86]. data are mean ± sd for n=3

amphetamine-treated rats, forward locomotion is markedly
stimulated and reaches a level of 6000 cm/20 min after the
1.0 mg/kg dose. motor activation produced by (+)-amphetamine increases in parallel with elevations in dialysate da,
suggesting a direct relationship between these two endpoints.
the data in fig. 12 illustrate that i.v. administration of pal287 increases extracellular levels of da and 5-ht in
prefrontal cortex, with effects on 5-ht being somewhat
greater. it is noteworthy that elevations in dialysate da
induced by pal-287 are similar to those induced by (+)amphetamine. despite the large increase in extracellular da
produced by pal-287, this drug produces very little forward
locomotion (fig. 12). specifically, after a 3 mg/kg i.v. dose
of pal-287, dialysate da levels are increased 8-fold above
baseline but ambulation distance is only 1000 cm/20 min.
these data provide compelling evidence that stimulation of
5-ht release can antagonize the locomotor stimulation
produced by da release.

the reinforcing effects of pal-287 have been evaluated
in rhesus monkeys. findings depicted in fig. 13 demonstrate
that pal-287 is not self-administered by monkeys trained to
self-inject cocaine. similar results were obtained when a
series of pal amphetamines were tested in the monkey selfadministration assay. as shown in fig. 14, pal-313 displays
the lowest reinforcing efficacy in vivo, and this drug is the
most potent sert substrate in vitro (table 5). the data
suggest that serotonergic effects of pal-287 and pal-313

blunt the reinforcing effects normally associated with da
release. it should be noted that pal-287 can readily
suppresses on-going cocaine self-administration, even
though pal-287 drug lacks stimulating and reinforcing
effects [21]. the findings support the feasibility of developing non-amphetamine releasers with low abuse potential, by
designing dual da and 5-ht releasing activity into a single
molecule. additionally, pal-287 displays a more desirable
side-effects profile when compared to amphetamine-type
sert substrates. pal-287 has reduced affinity for 5-ht2b
receptors and does not persistently deplete brain 5-ht.
taken together, our findings support the possibility of
developing dual da/5-ht releasers that will not produce
adverse effects associated with other sert substrates, such
as fenfluramine [22].

we have used our assay procedures to screen a variety of
compounds that might possess transporter activity, and
previously unpublished data for a few specific agents are
mentioned here. the alkaloid nantenine (9,10-methylenedioxy-1,2-dimethoxyaporphine) is a naturally-occurring
compound from the fruit of nandina domestica that bears
structural similarity to mdma. nantenine is reported to
antagonize many of the effects of mdma in mice [87].
because mdma is a substrate of the monoamine transporters, nantenine could block the effects of mdma by acting
as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. as shown in table 2,
nantenine (supplied by dr. fantegrossi) is inactive as a
monoamine releaser and as an uptake inhibitor. tramadol is
an analgesic drug sometimes linked to the development of
the 5-ht behavioral syndrome [88]. as reported in table 2,
tramadol inhibits  xxxg2148xxx  and sert uptake with ki values in
the low micromolar range. our sert results are similar to

those reported by barann et al. [89] and indicate that
tramadol may inhibit sert and dat uptake at therapeutic
doses. finally, jdtic ((3r)-7-hydroxy-n-((1s)-1-([(3r,4r)4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl)-2methylpropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide) is a potent and selective kappa-opioid receptor
antagonist [90] that has been reported to have antidepressantlike effects [91]. such antidepressant activity could be
mediated by blockade of monoamine transporters.
interestingly, the ki of jdtic is 6.8 ± 0.9 nm at cloned
human  xxxg2148xxx  labeled with [125i]rti-55 and 126 ± 23 nm at
rat brain  xxxg2148xxx  labeled with [3h]nisoxetine (table 2).
although the  xxxg2148xxx  binding assays suggest that jdtic might
inhibit  xxxg2148xxx  function at pharmacologically relevant doses,
this seems unlikely because jdtic inhibits dat and  xxxg2148xxx 
uptake with ki values in the low micromolar range, a value
1000-fold higher than its ki for the  xxxg1633xxx  (0.02
nm). the difference between the ki of jdtic in the  xxxg2148xxx 
binding assay and the  xxxg2148xxx  uptake inhibition assay probably
reflects the different assay conditions used [92].
conclusions
psychomotor stimulants are a fascinating group of
compounds that continue to present many challenges to the
researcher and clinician. on one hand, psychostimulants can
be useful therapeutic agents, while on the other hand, many
of these compounds serve as powerful drugs of abuse. we
believe that the findings reviewed herein contribute new
insights with regard to the mechanism of older amphetamine-type agents. more importantly, these data provide a
basis for designing new monoamine releasing agents with
diminished adverse effects that could serve as novel treat-
