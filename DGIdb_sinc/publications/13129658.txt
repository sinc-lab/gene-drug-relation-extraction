schizophrenia is not associated with  xxxg658xxx  48-base-pair-repeat length or individual alleles: results of a meta-analysis.  the gene  xxxg658xxx , coding for  xxxg658xxx , was considered a candidate for association with schizophrenia based on its upregulation in postmortem schizophrenic brain and affinity for clozapine. many studies sought allelic association of a 48-base-pair repeat in  xxxg658xxx  exon 3 with schizophrenia, but found no strong evidence for a relationship. the present work sought to determine if this observation reflected the true absence of association or the low power of individual studies.
