 xxxd1784xxx  on rat diaphragm.   xxxd1784xxx  hydrochloride, an anti-parkinson drug having central cholinolytic properties, was found to cause neuromuscular blockade in the isolated rat diaphragm preparation. the neuromuscular blockade by  xxxd1784xxx  remained unaffected in presence of neostigmine and tetraethylammonium. lower concentrations of  xxxd1784xxx  potentiated the paralytic effect of  xxxd3456xxx . a similar paralytic effect of  xxxd1784xxx  was observed in the pharmacologically denervated rat diaphragm. responses to acetylcholine administered by retrograde i.v. injection were found to be inhibited in presence of  xxxd1784xxx . these results suggest that the neuromuscular blockade by  xxxd1784xxx  is produced by a postsynaptic direct effect on the muscle.
