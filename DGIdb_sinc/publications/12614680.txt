the amino acids gaba and glycine are the major inhibitory
neurotransmitters in the mammalian nervous system. they
mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission by activating
two pharmacologically distinct receptors that gate chloride
channels: gabaa and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. gabaa and glycine receptors share a common transmembrane topology and significant sequence homology,
being members of the same receptor superfamily (bormann et al., 1987; betz, 1990). the gabaa receptor is an
oligomeric protein that has separate but allosterically interacting binding sites for gaba, benzodiazepines and for
picrotoxinin(ptx)-like convulsants. there is a high multiplicity of subunit combinations in gabaa receptors in
mammals, with 19 subunits cloned to date (␣1-6; ␤1-3;
␥1-3; ⑀; ␦; ␪; ␲, and ␳1-3) (macdonald and olsen, 1994;
sieghart et al., 1999; cherubini and conti, 2001; rudolph
et al., 2001). inhibitory glycine receptors are pentameric
protein complexes composed of ␣1-3 and ␤ subunits that
constitute a ligand-gated ion channel permeable for chloride ions (langosch et al., 1990; legendre, 2001; xue et
al., 2001). strychnine-sensitive inhibitory glycine receptors
are distributed throughout the cns. the strength of glycinergic inhibition governs the rhythmic output of mammalian motor systems and  xxxg904xxx  deficits are linked
to human pathologies such as hereditary hyperekplexia or
startle syndrome (legendre, 2001).
the neurotoxic organochlorine pesticides ␥- xxxd2488xxx  (lindane) and the cyclodiene-related compounds dieldrin and ␣-endosulfan induce in mammals a
hyperexcitability syndrome that can progress until the production of convulsions (suñol et al., 1989; bloomquist,
1992, 2002). different studies have shown that lindane and
cyclodienes interact with the gabaa receptor. they inhibit
the binding of t-[35s]butylbicyclophosphorothionate
([35s]tbps) to the ptx recognition site and inhibit the
gaba-induced cl⫺ flux following activation of gabaa receptors, without modifying the benzodiazepine and gaba
recognition sites (abalis et al., 1985, 1986; obata et al.,
1988; woodward et al., 1992; pomés et al., 1993, 1994;
huang and casida, 1996; ikeda et al., 1998; vale et al.,
1997; suñol et al., 1998; bloomquist, 2002). lindane also
blocks chloride channels composed of homomeric ␳
gabaa receptors (woodward et al., 1992) and voltage-

abstract—the neurotoxic organochlorine pesticides ␥- xxxd2488xxx , ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin induce in
mammals a hyperexcitability syndrome accompanied by convulsions. they reduce the gaba-induced clⴚ flux. the
strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx  also regulates clⴚ-flux
inhibitory responses. we studied the effects of these compounds on clⴚ channels associated with glycine receptors in
cultured cerebellar granule cells in comparison to the gabaa
receptor. both gaba (ec50: 5 ␮m) and glycine (ec50: 68 ␮m)
increased 36clⴚ influx. this increase was antagonized by
bicuculline and strychnine, respectively. lindane inhibited
with similar potency both gabaa (ic50: 6.1 ␮m) and glycine
(5.0 ␮m) receptors. ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin inhibited the
gabaa receptor (ic50 values: 0.4 ␮m and 0.2 ␮m, respectively) more potently than the  xxxg904xxx  (ic50 values:
3.5 ␮m and 3 ␮m, respectively). picrotoxinin also inhibited
the  xxxg904xxx , although with low potency (ic50>100
␮m). a 3d pharmacophore model, consisting of five hydrophobic regions and one hydrogen bond acceptor site in a
specific three-dimensional arrangement, was developed for
these compounds by computational modelling. we propose
that the hydrogen bond acceptor moiety and the hydrophobic
region were responsible for the affinity of these compounds
at the gabaa receptor whereas only the hydrophobic region
of the molecules was responsible for their interaction with
the glycine receptors. in summary, these compounds could
produce neuronal hyperexcitability by blocking glycine receptors besides the gabaa receptor. we propose that two
zones of the polychlorocycloalkane pesticide molecules (a
lipophilic zone and a polar zone) differentially contribute to
their binding to gabaa and glycine receptors. © 2003 ibro.

dependent chloride channels (matsumoto et al., 1988). all
these findings suggest that other chloride channels besides the gabaa receptor could serve as target for these
compounds. in a preliminary study we have found that
lindane also blocked the cl⫺ flux induced by glycine (suñol
et al., 1998).
therefore, in order to gain more insight into the mechanism of neurotoxicity of polychlorocycloalkane insecticides we wished to investigate and compare the effect of
lindane, ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin on chloride channels
associated with gabaa and glycine receptors. computational studies were performed to establish a 3d pharmacophore hypothesis for the identification of the minimum
requirements for lindane, ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin recognition of gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  channels. primary
cultures of cerebellar granule cells, which express both
gabaa and glycine receptors, were used through the
study.

experimental procedures
materials
seven-day-old nmri mice were obtained from iffa credo (st.germain-sur-l’arbreste, france). plastic tissue-culture dishes and
multiwell plates were purchased from costar (corning science
products, acton, ma, usa), and nunc ltd. (roskilde, denmark).
foetal calf serum was obtained from gibco (glasgow, uk) and
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem) was from biochrom
(berlin, germany). 36cl⫺ was from nen, life sciences products,
inc. (ma, usa). liquid scintillation cocktail optiphase “hisafe” two
was from wallac oy (turku, finland). (⫺)-bicuculline methiodide,
gaba, glycine, ptx and strychnine were from sigma chemical
co. (st. louis, mo, usa). ␣-endosulfan was from cromlab sl
(barcelona, spain) and dieldrin and ␥- xxxd2488xxx 
were from lgc (teddington middlesex, uk). polychlorocycloalkanes were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) at a final
dmso concentration of 0.2% v/v. all the other chemicals were of
the purest grade available from commercial sources.

cell cultures
primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells were obtained from
cerebella of 7-day-old mice following the method described by
schousboe et al. (1989). in brief, cells were dissociated by mild
trypsinisation at 37 °c, followed by trituration in a dnase solution
(0.004% w/v) containing a soybean  xxxd207xxx  (0.05% w/v).
the cells were suspended in dmem containing 25-mm kcl,
31-mm glucose, and 0.2-mm glutamine supplemented with pamino benzoate, insulin, penicillin and 10% foetal calf serum. the
cell suspension was seeded in 24-multiwell plates precoated with
poly-l-lysine and incubated for 7–9 days in a humidified 5%
co2/95% air atmosphere at 36.8 °c. a mixture of 5-␮m 5-fluoro2'-deoxyuridine and 20-␮m uridine was added before 48 h in
culture to prevent glial proliferation.
animal handling was accomplished according to an accepted
protocol (407/99, university of barcelona, generalitat de catalunya, spain) following eu guidelines. the university of barcelona
has the statement of compliance on file with the office of laboratory animal welfare/national institutes of health (olaw/nih, a
5224-01). experiments were designed in order to minimize the
number of animals used and animal suffering.

clⴚ flux
cl⫺ flux was determined by the 36cl⫺ uptake assay in intact
cellular cultures (pomés et al., 1994; vale et al., 1999 with mod-

ifications, kardos and guidotti, 1988). briefly, cell cultures were
rinsed and the culture medium was replaced with an earle’s
 xxxd2988xxx  containing (in mm): 116 nacl, 0.8  xxxd2534xxx ,
1.8 cacl2, 1 nah2po4, 15.2 nahco3, and 5.5 glucose, adjusted
to ph 7.4. after 30 min of preincubation in a humidified 5%
co2/95% air atmosphere at 36.8 °c, the cells were preincubated
for an additional period of 10 min at room temperature. cultures
were incubated 7 s with hepes buffer (135-mm nacl, 5.4-mm
kcl, 1.4-mm mgcl2, 1.2-mm cacl2, 1-mm nah2po4, 20-mm
hepes, and 9-mm glucose, adjusted to ph 7.4) containing 36cl⫺
(0.2– 0.7 ␮ci/ml) without/with the agonists gaba or glycine.
gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  antagonists and polychlorocycloalkanes, when used, were present during the preincubation (10 min)
and incubation (7 s) time. inhibition of cl⫺ flux by antagonists and
polychlorocycloalkanes was performed using 100-␮m gaba and
300-␮m glycine. controls contained buffer or 0.2% dmso (v/v). at
this concentration, dmso did not modify 36cl⫺ uptake. each well
was rinsed three times with 1 ml ice-cold buffer. cells were collected in 0.2-n naoh and aliquots were measured for determination of radioactivity and protein content. radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. well protein content was
measured by a micro-test using the bradford method adapted to
microtiter plates, with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard. basal
36
cl⫺ uptake in the absence of agonists was determined in each
experiment and subtracted from all culture wells to obtain the net
36
cl⫺ uptake. net 36cl⫺ uptake values were used in the calculations of percentage of maximum cl⫺ uptake.

analysis of data and statistics
the data were expressed as means⫾s.e.m. cl⫺ uptake values
were normalised to the responses obtained at 100-␮m gaba and
300-␮m glycine, which gave maximum responses.
concentration-response data were fit by non-linear regression analysis to sigmoid curves using a three- or four-parameter
logistic equation (prism programme, graphpad software, san
diego, ca, usa). two-way analysis of variance followed by the
bonferroni test was used to assess whether significant differences
existed. p⬍0.05 was considered to be significant.

computational methods
all computations were accomplished using the programme catalyst, version 4.6 (accelrys inc., burlington, ma, usa) running on a
silicon graphics octane2 workstation operating under irix 6.5.
pharmacophore hypothesis generation was performed using the
module hiphop as implemented in catalyst. briefly, this approach
tries to identify common features present in a set of active compounds. within the software, molecules are described as a set of
chemical functions distributed in the 3d space. molecular flexibility
is taken into account for each compound by sampling the conformational space in order to specify the number (maximum of 255)
of conformations which are accessible to the molecule within a
given energy range (20 kcal/mol). pharmacophore models are
described as a set of features distributed in 3d space. the types
of features taken into account considering the structure of the
molecules were hydrophobic centres and hydrogen bond donor/
acceptors. the hydrophobic centres were represented as centroids with tolerance spheres. the hydrogen bond donor/acceptors were represented by centroids with projection points, both
with their respective tolerance spheres. we generated several
hypotheses by considering different training sets (minimum of two
molecules per training set) and the software ranked them according to fit quality and uniqueness criteria. additionally, visual inspection of the fit of each training-set molecule to the hypotheses
as well as consideration of the experimental data were used to
choose the best pharmacophore model.

results
gaba- and glycine-induced clⴚ flux in primary
cultures of cerebellar granule neurons
in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells both gaba
and glycine induced a concentration-dependent cl⫺ influx.
fig. 1a, shows the concentration response curves for both
inhibitory neurotransmitters. log ec50 values for gabaand glycine-induced cl⫺ flux were ⫺5.33⫾0.14 (n⫽3) and
⫺4.17⫾0.06 (n⫽4), which correspond to ec50 values of 5
␮m and 68 ␮m respectively.
fig. 1b shows that gaba-induced cl⫺ flux was inhibited by the competitive gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline (100 ␮m), but not by the  xxxg904xxx  antagonist
strychnine (20 ␮m) in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. contrarily, bicuculline (100 ␮m) failed to reduce
the cl⫺ flux induced by glycine whereas the  xxxg904xxx  antagonist strychnine (20 ␮m) inhibited glycine-induced
cl⫺ flux. strychnine was highly potent on  xxxg904xxx 
in cultured cerebellar granule cells with an ic50 value
against the glycine-induced cl⫺ flux of 60 nm (data not
shown). fig. 1b also shows that the non-competitive
gabaa receptor antagonist ptx, which acts as a cl⫺
channel blocker, inhibited 50% of the gaba-induced cl⫺
flux at around 10 ␮m and completely blocked the cl⫺ flux
at concentrations ⱖ100 ␮m. the glycine-induced cl⫺ flux
was inhibited by ptx in a concentration-dependent manner; however, ptx concentrations ⬎100 ␮m were needed
to inhibit cl⫺ flux by 50% in primary cultures of cerebellar
granule cells.
effects of ␥- xxxd2488xxx , ␣-endosulfan
and dieldrin on gaba- and glycine-induced clⴚ flux
fig. 2 and table 1 show the effect of the organochlorine
pesticides ␥- xxxd2488xxx  (lindane), ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin on gaba- and glycine-induced cl⫺ flux.
two-way analysis of variance of ic50 data represented on
table 1 revealed statistically significant differences for the
receptor type (f1,17⫽20.53; p⫽0.0003) and the neurotoxic
polychlorocycloalkane pesticide (f2,17⫽13.04; p⫽0.0004),
as follows. lindane inhibited both glycine- and gabainduced cl⫺ flux with similar potency (fig. 2a, table 1).
fig. 2b and 2c shows the concentration-response curves
for the inhibitory effect of ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin on
glycine- and gaba-induced cl⫺ flux. both compounds
inhibited with higher potency the gaba- than the glycineinduced cl⫺ flux (table 1). furthermore, ␣-endosulfan and
dieldrin were more potent than lindane at the gabaa receptor. no differences were found amongst the ic50 values
of the three neurotoxic pesticides against the  xxxg904xxx  (table 1).
3d pharmacophore model
in order to correlate the observed cl⫺ flux inhibition elicited
by the channel antagonists considered in this study with
their structure, a common feature analysis on ptx, lindane, ␣-endosulfan, dieldrin and its stereoisomer endrin
was performed. although endrin was not included in the

300-␮m glycine. cultures were preincubated with buffer or antagonists
for 10 min and incubated for 7 s with 36cl⫺ and gaba (white bars) or
glycine (black bars) in the absence or in the presence of antagonists.

cl⫺-flux inhibition studies described above, it was incorporated into the generation of the pharmacophore hypothesis. endrin is a polychlorocycloalkane pesticide, it shows
similar potency to that of ␣-endosulfan or dieldrin in the
inhibition of gaba-dependent chloride flux in cultured neurons (pomés et al., 1993, 1994) and, like dieldrin and
␣-endosulfan, it partially inhibited glycine-dependent chloride flux at high concentrations (suñol et al., 1998). fig. 3
shows the chemical structure of these compounds.

c. vale et al. / neuroscience 117 (2003) 397– 403

from the different hypotheses generated, the best one
was obtained from a training set constituted by ␣-endosulfan, dieldrin and endrin. this pharmacophore model consisted of five hydrophobic regions (h1–h5) and one hydrogen-bond acceptor site in a specific three-dimensional
orientation (fig. 4, table 2). the three compounds in the
training set can simultaneously align four chlorine atoms
and the gem-dichloromethylene group with the five hydrophobic centers. likewise, they can arrange an oxygen
atom (the thiocarbonylic oxygen of ␣-endosulfan and the
epoxide oxygen atoms of dieldrin and endrin) with the
centroid of the hydrogen-bond acceptor site (fig. 4). by
contrast, lindane can only be aligned with the hydrophobic
regions of the model, whilst ptx fits only partially to the
hydrophobic and the hydrogen-bond acceptor sites (fig.
4). according to this model both the hydrophobic regions
and the hydrogen-bond acceptor centre are necessary to
efficiently block the chloride flux through the gaba-dependent channels. on the other hand, the model suggests the
absence of a hydrogen-bond acceptor site in the glycinegated channels with the geometry shown in the pharmacophore model of fig. 4. overall, this pharmacophore hypothesis shows a good qualitative correlation with the experimental results observed for each of the compounds.

(a), ␣-endosulfan (b) and dieldrin (c) of gaba- and glycine-induced
cl⫺ flux. cultures were preincubated with buffer or polychlorocycloalkanes for 10 min and incubated for 7 s with 36cl⫺ and agonists (䊐)
100-␮m gaba, or (ƒ) 300-␮m glycine) in presence of different polychlorocycloalkane concentrations. results are expressed as percentage of net 36cl⫺ uptake of agonist response (gaba or glycine)
(mean⫾s.e.m. of three to five experiments; each point of the individual curves was determined in three to four culture wells). concentration-response data were fit using a three-parameter logistic equation
(one-site competition curve): y⫽yo⫹(100⫺yo)/(1⫹10(x⫺log ec50)),
where x is the log concentration of polychlorocycloalkane and y is the
percentage of net uptake in response to agonist.

the present results support and extend previous findings
demonstrating that cerebellar granule cells in culture express both gabaa and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors that are functionally active. gabaa and glycine receptors are oligomeric proteins, each subunit having four
transmembrane segments (m1–m4). the cl⫺ channel in
both the gabaa and the  xxxg904xxx  is formed by the
alignment of the m2 domains from the receptor subunits.
in the present work ptx showed a stronger inhibition
of the gabaa-induced cl⫺ flux than the glycine-induced
cl⫺ flux. according to a model proposed by zhorov and
bregestovski (2000) ptx binds to the cytoplasmic half of
the pore and this binding is stabilised by hydrogen bonds
as well as by an interaction with a hydrophobic ring of
amino acid residues within the m2 segment. threonine
residues donate hydrogen bonds and proline and alanine
residues in the pore facing of the m2 segments support
hydrophobicity. experimental data are in agreement with
this model (pribilla et al., 1992; ffrench-constant et al.,
1993; buhr et al., 2001; shan et al., 2001). a conserved
threonine residue in the m2 segment is present in most
gabaa receptor subunits as well as in the ␣ subunit of the
 xxxg904xxx , whereas this residue is lacking in the ␤
subunit of the  xxxg904xxx  (pribilla et al., 1992; zhorov
and bregestovski, 2000; shan et al., 2001).
both heteromeric gabaa receptors and homomeric ␣
glycine receptors, but not heteromeric ␣␤ glycine receptors, are supposed to have five threonine residues facing
the cl⫺ channel lumen at the same sectional level of the
receptor. primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells constitutively express ␣, ␤ and ␥ gabaa receptor subunits in
a pattern resembling that found in adult animal, and ␣ and

1994; gao and fritschy, 1995; kaneda et al., 1995; nadler
et al., 1996; carlson et al., 1998; elster et al., 1998). the
presence of the ␤ subunit of the  xxxg904xxx  should
confer less sensitivity to ptx against the glycine-induced
cl⫺ flux in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. the
reduced potency of ptx in the  xxxg904xxx  relative to
that in the gabaa receptor found in this work is in agreement with ptx forming hydrogen bonds with a different
number of threonine residues in both gabaa and glycine
receptors expressed in cultured cerebellar granule cells.
our results are also in agreement with the findings for ptx
inhibition of glycine-induced currents in cultured cerebellar
granule cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (virginio and cherubini, 1997; elster et al., 1998).
it has been demonstrated that the subunit composition
of the gabaa receptor determines the pharmacology of
benzodiazepines (rudolph et al., 2001), but there are few
studies with regard to the pharmacology of non-competitive gabaa receptor antagonists related to receptor subunit composition. ratra et al. (2001) have reported that
␣-endosulfan and lindane displayed a similar and very high
potency in recombinant ␤3 homooligomeric gabaa receptors, whereas ␣-endosulfan was more potent than lindane
in native gabaa receptors (abalis et al., 1986; obata et
al., 1988; pomés et al., 1993, 1994; huang and casida,
1996; this work). other authors found that lindane showed
similar potencies in gabaa receptors composed of differ-

ent ␣, ␤ and ␥ subunits (nagata et al., 1996; maskell et al.,
2001). these findings suggest that receptor subunit composition may determine the sensitivity and selectivity of
polychlorocycloalkane toxicity.
in the present work we found that lindane blocked with
similar potency gabaa and glycine receptors whereas
␣-endosulfan and dieldrin were more potent at inhibiting
gabaa than glycine-gated cl⫺ channels in cultured cerebellar granule cells. here we also found that both ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin molecules fit to a pharmacophore

model containing a hydrophobic zone and a hydrogenbond acceptor site, whereas lindane fit only to the hydrophobic zone. this would conform to a model where the
hydrophobic zone would increase the probability of the
compound to interact with the ring composed of non-polar
amino acid residues in the channel lumen, a feature common to gabaa and glycine receptors, whereas the hydrogen-bond acceptor zone would increase the probability of
the compound to interact with the ring composed of threonine residues (lacking in  xxxg904xxx  ␤ subunits). by
analogy with the model proposed for the interaction of ptx
with gabaa and glycine receptors, the molecules with a
hydrogen-bond acceptor zone would be more potent at the
gabaa receptor than at the  xxxg904xxx . thusly, ␣-endosulfan and dieldrin conformed to a pharmacophore hypothesis having a hydrogen-bond acceptor zone and were
more potent at the gabaa than at the  xxxg904xxx 
(table 1), suggesting that this part of the molecule determines the high affinity of these compounds for the gabaa
receptor. endrin, which also fit to the same model, is highly
potent at the gabaa receptor (abalis et al., 1986; pomés
et al., 1993, 1994). in the same way, the pharmacophore
model shows that ␣-endosulfan, dieldrin, and lindane
shared a hydrophobic zone. this part of the molecule
would contribute to the binding of the polychlorocycloalkane pesticides to the lipophilic ring of both gaba and
glycine receptors. the pharmacophoric features included
in this hypothesis are not necessarily the only conditions
that a molecule must have to be a good inhibitor of the
receptors considered. other factors like the steric limitations imposed by the structure of the channel are difficult to
be taken into account in the absence of three-dimensional
data of the channel. this could justify, for example, the
differential activity at the gabaa receptor observed for the
isomers of lindane, ␣-, ␤- and ␦- xxxd2488xxx ,
which show a similar degree of hydrophobicity as lindane,
but a relatively different molecular shape. it has been
suggested that  xxxd2488xxx  isomers could bind
to different sites at the gabaa receptor (nagata et al.,
1996; aspinwall et al., 1997).
in summary, in this work we show that ␣-endosulfan,
dieldrin and lindane inhibited the glycine-induced cl⫺ flux.
the studied organochlorine pesticides displayed similar
potencies at the  xxxg904xxx  in comparison with their
different potencies at the gabaa receptor. we propose
that two parts of the polychlorocycloalkane pesticide molecule differentially contribute to its binding to gaba and
glycine receptors: the lipophilic part being common for both

receptors and the polar part being determinant for the
increased affinity of ␣-endosulfan, dieldrin and endrin at
the gabaa receptor in relation to the  xxxg904xxx . in
this way, the similar interaction of lindane with both gabaa
and  xxxg904xxx  would agree with a contribution of
chloride channels other than the gabaa receptor to the in
vivo toxicity of lindane, as suggested by bloomquist (1992,
2002). more experimental data including different organochlorine pesticides and their activity on the gabaa and
glycine receptors would be necessary to test the predictive
capacity of this model. however, this model provides information regarding pharmacophoric features for the interaction of compounds with gabaa and glycine receptoroperated channels whose crystallographic structures are
not yet known.
