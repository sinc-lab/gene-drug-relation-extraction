abstract
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of indomethacin alone and with phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitory agents
( xxxd3142xxx , theophylline) on the isolated trachea preparations from control and ovalbumin sensitized guinea-pigs. adult male guineapigs, weighing 300–350 g, were randomly allocated to 2 experimental groups each consisting of 12 animals. guinea-pigs were
sensitized by i.m. injections of 0.35 ml of a 5% (w/v) ovalbumin/saline solution into each thigh (0.7 ml total) on days 1 and 4. tissues
were ﬁrst contracted with a submaximal concentration of histamine (106 m). we tested the effects of indomethacin (107–104 m)
on the resting tension and precontracted with histamine on the isolated trachea preparations from control and ovalbumin sensitized
guinea-pigs. we also tested the effects of the  xxxd3142xxx , theophylline and  xxxd2401xxx  isolated trachea preparations precontracted
with histamine in indomethacin incubated or non-incubated groups.
we found that the relaxant effects of  xxxd3142xxx  and theophylline increased, but not of  xxxd2401xxx , in the presence of
indomethacin in isolated trachea preparations precontracted from control and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs. in the presence of
indomethacin there was no difference in relaxant responses between both groups. therefore, we concluded that the increased
relaxant responses may be due to inhibitor effect of this agent on pde isoenzymes.

1. introduction
asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by
episodic wheezing, coughing and chest tightness associated with airway obstruction [1]. the studies show that
increases in cellular concentrations of camp or cgmp
mediate the relaxation of airway smooth muscle [2].
recently, it has been reported that phosphodiesterase
(pde) inhibitors have potential use in asthma treatment
by increasing the camp and cgmp levels. indomethacin, an anti-inﬂammatory agent, is a drug which is used
in the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
 xxxg1055xxx  and acute gut arthritis. there are
some studies which have been shown that there is an
interaction between prostaglandins and pde isoenzymes [3,4]. in vitro studies, it has been suggested that
indomethacin inhibits pde isoenzymes and increases
camp concentration [5].

allergic asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, allergen-speciﬁc immunoglobulin e in
serum, and inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells into the
airways [6–8]. ovalbumin-induced asthma in guineapigs is widely accepted as an experimental model of
bronchial asthma and was applied in this study [9]. it is
well known that non-steroidal inﬂammatory drugs can
trigger asthmatic crisis. the aim of this study was to
investigate whether the indomethacin is useful in
asthmatic patients who are in need of anti-inﬂammatory
drug treatment. for this reason, we investigated the
effects of indomethacin alone and with pde inhibitory
agents on the isolated trachea preparations from control
and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs.

adult male guinea-pigs, weighing 300–350 g, were
randomly allocated to 2 experimental groups each
consisting of 12 animals. the animal’s weight was

recorded. they were individually placed in metal cages
in a quiet and temperature and humidity-controlled
room (2273 c and 6075%, respectively) in which a
12–12 h light–dark cycle was maintained (08:00–20:00 h
light). the animals were provided with ad librium food
and water.
2.2. sensitization of guinea-pigs
guinea-pigs were sensitized by i.m. injections of
0.35 ml of a 5% (w/v) ovalbumin/saline solution into
each thigh (0.7 ml total) on days 1 and 4. the guineapigs were ready for use after day 25.
2.3. experimental procedures
guinea-pigs were stunned and killed by decapitation.
the trachea was removed rapidly and transverse rings
(3 mm long) were cut and then mounted in thermostatically controlled (37 c) organ baths. the organ
baths contained 20 ml krebs–henseleit solution (khs)
of the following composition (in mm): nacl 118, kcl
5.9,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco3 25.5, nah2po4 1.2, cacl2
2.5, glucose 5.6 and  xxxd2534xxx  1.2 or free. the ph of the
solution was 7.4 during bubbling with 5% co2 in o2.
isometric tension was continuously measured with a
force transducer (fdt10-a, commat ltd., turkey),
connected to a computer-based data acquisition system
(tda 97, commat ltd., turkey). the tissues were
stretched initially to a tension of 1 g for 30 s and
thereafter maintained for 60 min under a resting tension
of 0.5 g, which was found to be optimal for measuring
the changes in tension. the preparations were washed
with khs every 15 min during the equilibration period.
2.4. experiments on isolated tracheal rings
to examine the effects of drugs, tissues were ﬁrst
contracted with a submaximal concentration of histamine (106 m). this histamine concentration was
determined from preliminary experiments to elicit 70%
of its maximum concentration. we tested the effects of
indomethacin (107–104 m) on the resting tension and
precontracted with histamine on the isolated trachea
preparations from control and ovalbumin-sensitized
guinea-pigs. we also tested the effects of the  xxxd3142xxx ,
theophylline and  xxxd2401xxx  on isolated trachea
preparations precontracted with histamine in the indomethacin incubated or non-incubated groups. all
drugs and their solvents were added in a cumulative
manner.
2.5. drugs
the following drugs were obtained from the sigma
chemical company (st. louis, mo, usa): indometha-

cin,  xxxd2401xxx , theophylline, histamine, and papaverine.  xxxd3142xxx  ( xxxd3142xxx ) was obtained from schering
(germany).

2.6. preparation of drug solutions
indomethacin:  xxxd102xxx  was used to dissolve
this drug to make a solution of 102 m.  xxxd3142xxx  was
dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso).
ethanol and dmso did not have signiﬁcant effect on
trachea preparations in both groups.
although, forget et al. has shown that ethanol
exposure in airway epithelium increases camp-dependent protein kinase activity in bovine bronchial epithelial cells [10], we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect of
ethanol in the guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscles.
other drugs were dissolved in distilled water.
drugs solutions were prepared fresh on the day of
experiment by diluting the stock solution in distilled
water.

2.7. analysis of results
at the end of each experiment, tracheal rings were
detached from the recording set up, blotted and
weighed. the contractile and relaxant responses were
expressed as milligrams (mg) of tension developed per
mg of tissue-wet weight. at the end of the experiment
papaverine (104 m) was added to elicit maximal
relaxation and results expressed as a percentage of this
maximum responses. it is well known that this agent has
potent relaxant effects on smooth muscle preparations.
all values are expressed as means7s.e.m. and ‘‘n’’
indicated the number of animal preparations. statistical
analysis of the results was performed using student’s ttest. p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. results
3.1. effect of indomethacin on trachea preparation
although indomethacin induced concentration-dependent contractile responses in resting tension (data
not shown), it induced relaxant responses on the isolated
trachea preparations precontracted with histamine from
control and ovalbumin sensitized guinea-pigs (figs. 1
and 2). these contractile and relaxant effects produced
by indomethacin were not statistically different between
control and ovalbumin-sensitized groups.

ogy of asthma has been seen. asthma has been described
as a ‘chronic desquamative eosinophilic bronchitis’ [11–
13]. so this new description makes a new therapeutic
approach to asthma. therefore, the importance of the
drugs such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which have an
inﬂammatory effect, increased in the treatment of asthma
[14]. the intracellular levels of camp are regulated by the
rate of camp production by receptor-coupled adenylate
cyclase and the rate of camp degradation by 30 ,50 -cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterases. pde isoenzymes have been
classiﬁed into seven distinct families [15]. of these,  xxxg1695xxx ,
pde4 and  xxxg1704xxx  appear to be most important for the
regulation of camp in different cell types. especially,
pde4 isoenzymes play a more dominant role in inﬂammatory cells [16]. pde isoenzymes (i–v) have also been
demonstrated in airways smooth muscle and isoenzymeselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors have relaxant effects
on airways smooth muscle of several species including man
[17,18]. also, it has been shown that selective pde iv
inhibitors also cause bronchodilatation in guinea-pigs [19].
in our study, theophylline and  xxxd3142xxx  produced
concentration-dependent relaxant responses in histamine
precontracted isolated trachea preparations from control
and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs. also,  xxxd2401xxx

induced concentration-dependent relaxant responses in
histamine precontracted isolated trachea preparations in
both groups. incubated indomethacin did not cause a
signiﬁcant alteration in response of control and ovalbumin
sensitized guinea-pigs. there are some studies that indicate
indomethacin inhibits camp phosphodiesterase activity.
beatty and co-workers showed that indomethacin inhibits
camp pde in the myometrium of the pregnant rhesus
monkey under in vitro and in vivo conditions [20]. also,
other studies have suggested that indomethacin has
relaxant effects on various types of agent-induced
bronchoconstriction [5,21,22].
in this study, as we have found that the relaxant
effects of  xxxd3142xxx  and theophylline but not those of
 xxxd2401xxx  increased in the presence of indomethacin
in isolated trachea preparations from control and
ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs, we conclude that the
increased relaxant responses may be due to the inhibitor
effect of indomethacin on pde isoenzymes such as
camp-dependent pde iv isoenzymes. but, to clarify
more on this subject, further experiments and biochemical studies are needed. in some studies, it was shown
that 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-hete) has
multiple potential pro-inﬂammatory activities, including
stimulation of the release of mediators from mast cells,
induction of the release of mucous glycoprotein from
human airways in vitro, and concentration of human
bronchial smooth muscle in vitro [23–25]. thus 15hete could be regarded as a trigger or a mediator of
asthmatic and inﬂammatory reactions in the airways of
aspirin-hypersensitive asthmatic patients. it was shown
that aspirin added to leukocytes in aspirin-sensitive
asthmatic patients induced an increase in production of
15-hete. in another study peripheral blood leukocytes
from 7 of 9 aspirin-sensitive patients challenged with
naproxen reacted with an increase of 15-hete production. another preferential cox-1 inhibitor, indomethacin, tested in a separate experiment, failed to induce a
consistent 15-hete response [26]. furthermore, we
found that indomethacin increased the relaxant effects
of  xxxd3142xxx  and theophylline. for these reasons,
indomethacin may not be an appropriate choice as
anti-inﬂammatory drug for the asthmatic patients.
