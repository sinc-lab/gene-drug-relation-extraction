objectives: the degree and duration of protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction afforded
by three doses of a specific leukotriene d 4 receptor antagonist,  xxxd1702xxx , were assessed after an initial
dosing and after 1 week of therapy.
methods: a placebo-controlled crossover study was performed in eight male patients who had mild,
stable asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. treatment consisted of four 7-day periods of
placebo and three dose levels of the drug (lo, 50, and 200 mg administered orally). exercise challenge
was performed at 2 hours and 8 hours after treatment on the first and seventh treatment days. the
response was measured as the area under the fevl-ttme effect cutve (auec).
results: on the first day of treatment, the mean (++_sem) a u e c at 2 hours was 24.2 + 3.3 l .min
afler placebo and was 5.5 +_ 2.2 l • rain, 6.3 +_ 2. 7 l • min, 3.3 -- 3.8 l • min after 10 rag, 50 mg, and
200 mg, respectively (p < 0.05 for all values compared with placebo). the a u e c at 8 hours on the first
day was 25.1 +- 4.4 l • min afterplacebo and was 6.8 + 4.1 l • rain, 11.2 +_ 2.5 l . min, and 5.0 +_ 2.8
l . min after 10 rag, 50 mg, and 200 rag, respectively (p < o.05 for all values compared with placebo).
the protection afforded by 10 mg o f  xxxd1702xxx  was lost after 7 days of treatment but persisted with 50 mg
and 200 mg doses.
conclusion: orally administered  xxxd1702xxx  provides at least 8 hours o f protection against exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction. this protection is lost with regular treatment for 1 week for the lowest dose
studied. (j allergy clin immunol 199799.'210-5.)

exercise is a common stimulus for bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma?, 2 the exact mechanism
causing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (eib) has
not yet been fully elucidated, although release of bronchoconstrictor mediators caused by changes in airway
temperature and/or osmolality likely plays a major
role?, 4 the cysteinyl leukotrienes (lts) c4, d4, and e4
are potent bronchoconstrictor mediators 5, 6 involved in
causing eib. increased urinary excretion of lte4 by
patients with asthma after exercise has been shown in
one 7 but not in another study. 8 however, the most
compelling evidence is that several different lt receptor
antagonists have been shown to attenuate eib. 9-~2considerable variation exists in the degree of protection
afforded against eib by the different antagonists. however, the different antagonists have varied in potency,

selectivity, and mode of administration. to date, neither
the duration of protection nor the effects of regular
treatment on the degree of protection have been reported.
the objective of this study was to assess the degree
and duration of protection afforded by a new orally
delivered, potent and specific  xxxg599xxx  antagonist,
 xxxd1702xxx , 13 against eib. also, the effects of single
dosing and dosing for 7 days were studied. the protection was measured at both 2 hours and 8 hours after the
first and last dose during each of four multiple-dose
7-day treatment periods with 10, 50, and 200 mg or
placebo taken orally three times per day. an additional
objective was to measure plasma concentration profiles
at each dose level to determine whether variations in
protection against eib were associated with differences
in drug pharmacokinetics after regular dosing.

methods
subjects
eight male subjects with mild stable asthma and documented
eib (table i) gave written informed consent before taking part
in the study, which was approved by the research ethics
committee of mcmaster university. all subjects had asthma
that was controlled by inhaled [3z-agonist s taken only as needed,
were taking no other medications, and had a baseline fee1
greater than 70% of predicted normal value on all study days. 14
before the study, all subjects had to be free of respiratory tract
infections for at least 4 weeks. we have previously shown, in a
reproducibility study, that eight subjects are sufficient to demonstrate a 50% attenuation of eib attributable to treatment
effects.15

study design
subjects attended the laboratory on 10 occasions. subjects
were not permitted to use inhaled 132-agonists for at least 8
hours before each visit. at the first visit, screening history,
physical examination, spirometry, and resting electrocardiogram were performed. providing that results of these tests were
normal, a stage 1 incremental exercise test was performed on a
cycle ergometer 16,17 to assess work capacity. fev~ was measured before and after exercise by using a water-filled spirometer (collins) to document the presence of eib. on the second
visit, subjects performed a 5-minute exercise challenge with a
constant work rate on the cycle ergometer while breathing dry
room air (<10% relative humidity). the work rate was chosen
to produce a drop in fev 1 of at least 15% and to increase the
heart rate to approximately 80% of maximum. on this day,
venous blood and urine samples were obtained to ensure
normal chemistry values. in some subjects, in whom the fall in
fev~ was less than 15% or was considered to be too great, this
screening visit was repeated at a correspondingly higher or
lower work rate. the work rate used in the final screening
challenge was used in all subsequent exercise challenges during
treatment.
after successful screening, all subjects returned for 8 treatment visits, corresponding to days 1 and 7 of each of four
treatment periods. all treatment periods were separated by at
least 10 days. on the first and seventh days of each treatment
period, subjects arrived at the laboratory  xxxd2274xxx :30 am and had
baseline spirometry and vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate,
blood pressure) measured. the first dose of drug was then
orally administered. exercise challenges were performed 2
hours and 8 hours after drug administration. fev~ was measured before and immediately after completion of the challenge
and again at 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes after
exercise. vital signs were monitored at the same times as fevv

treatment
treatment was given according to a double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomized, crossover trial design, a8 treatment
consisted of four 7-day periods corresponding to placebo and
three dose levels of the drug. tablets (10, 50, or 200 mg) were
orally administered three times per day, except on the seventh
day, on which only the morning dose was given. the first doses
on day 1 and day 7 were administered in the laboratory; the
remaining medication was provided for the subjects in blister
packs for each treatment day.

pharmacokinetics
blood samples (7 ml) were collected by venipuncture into
heparinized tubes before drug administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4,

6, and 8 hours after dosing on days 1 and 7 to determine plasma
concentrations of  xxxd1702xxx . the blood samples were centrifuged immediately, and the plasma was stored at - 7 0 ° c until
analysis. one milliliter of 0.1 mol/l sodium phosphate solution,
ph 4.3, was added to the plasma samples, and the samples were
thoroughly mixed. after liquid-liquid extraction with etherchloroform (4:1 vol/vol), the sample was analyzed by reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (excitation, 358 nm; emission, 405 nm). the
mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: 0.05 mol/l nah2po 4
buffer (ph 4.3, 65:35, vol/vol). the lower limit of assay sensitivity was 2 ng/ml with 0.5 ml. the calibration curve was linear
with 0.5 ml samples from 2 to 1000 ng/ml. the interassay
coefficient of variation for the quality control samples (2 to 1000
ng/ml) was less than 10%.

analysis
the degree of eib was assessed as both the maximum
percent fall in postexercise f e e 1 below the pre-exercise baseline levels and the area below the fevl-time effect curve during
the hour after exercise (the pre-exercise fee1 was used as a
baseline for area measurements). treatment, duration of protection, and effect of multiple daily dosing for 1 week were
assessed by using a three-way repeated-measures analysis of
variance. 19the levels in this analysis were dose (placebo: 10 mg,
50 rag, 200 mg), time (2 hours, 8 hours), and study day (day 1,
day 7). post hoc comparisons were made by using newmankeuls tests after significant main effects or interactions were
observed. statistical significance was set at ~ < 0.05.

discussion

this study has demonstrated that pretreatment with
the specific lt receptor antagonist,  xxxd1702xxx , affords
significant protection against eib in patients with
asthma. this is in accordance with a number of studies
investigating the effects of other lt antagonists on
eib. 9-12 in addition, this study has examined the duration of the protection and the effects of multiple dosing
on the magnitude of protection of three doses of  xxxd1702xxx . the duration of protection afforded by the
initial singl e administration of all three doses of drug
lasted for at least 8 hours, and the degree of protection
did not differ between the 2-hour and 8-hour challenges.
the results were analyzed as both maximum percent fall
in fev1 and auec. the auec analysis provides
additional information about both the magnitude and
the extent of the protection afforded by the antagonist
against eib. after regular treatment for 1 week with the
10 mg dose of  xxxd1702xxx , the protective effect against
eib was not different from that observed with placebo ,
whereas the protective effect of 50 mg and 200 mg doses,
compared with placebo i was maintained for both the
2-hour and 8-hour challenges after treatment on day 7.
the significant reduction in eib after 1 week of
placebo treatment clearly illustrates the importance of
including placebo control conditions in studies of this

nature. this response to placebo does not influence the
interpretation of results presented here, because all
analyses of treatment effects were made relative to
placebo effects.
the importance of the cysteinyl lts in causing eib
has been suggested by a number of previous studies,
which have shown that a variety of lt receptor antagonists with different chemical structures attenuate
eib.9,12 the magnitude of protection in this study is
similar to that described for other antagonists, such as
mk 5719 and ici 204,219. l°, 12 all of these studies have
demonstrated a residual bronchoconstrictor response,
resistant to lt antagonism. this residual bronchoconstriction is of short duration (see fig. 1) and probably
represents another bronchoconstrictor mediator, such as
histamine; released along with the cysteinyl lts. however, the effects of ha-receptor antagonists together with
lt antagonists on this response have not yet been
studied.
the currently recommended management of eib
consists of pretreatment with either an inhaled f32agonist or  xxxd1763xxx  5 to 20 minutes before exercise? ° the duration of protection afforded by these
drugs is less than 4 hours. 21 more prolonged protection
against eib may be useful in children with asthma, in
whom pretreatment before each of their repeated bouts
of exercise is often impractical. prolonged protection
against eib has been demonstrated after treatment with
the long-actinginhaled [32-agonist , salmeterol, with pro-

tection t h a t lasts m o r e t h a n 12 hours. 21,z2 however,
regular t r e a t m e n t for 4 weeks with salmeterol results in
loss of this protective effect against eib. 14 interestingly,
as with i n h a l e d salmeterol, we have f o u n d t h a t regular
t r e a t m e n t with t h e lowest dose of  xxxd1702xxx  for 1 w e e k
results in loss of the p r o t e c t i o n against eib. t h e reasons
for t h e loss of the p r o t e c t i o n are unknown. this effect
has n o t b e e n previously r e p o r t e d for l t r e c e p t o r antagonists, possibly b e c a u s e the effects of single c o m p a r e d
with multiple dosing have n o t b e e n studied. this new
o b s e r v a t i o n is s t r e n g t h e n e d by the power of our analysis
(0.92) and the fact t h a t t h e loss of p r o t e c t i o n was evident
at b o t h the 2 - h o u r a n d 8-hour challenges after 1 w e e k of
10 m g dosing. o n e possible explanation for this finding
is e n h a n c e d m e t a b o l i s m a n d clearance of the drug after
regular t r e a t m e n t . this seems unlikely, because t h e
p l a s m a levels after the 10 m g dose are t h e same o n days
1 a n d 7. however, the possibility exists t h a t t h e clearance
of active m e t a b o l i t e s (not m e a s u r e d in this study) may
b e altered after multiple dosing. a n o t h e r p e r h a p s m o r e
plausible e x p l a n a t i o n is t h a t u p r e g u l a t i o n of the lt
r e c e p t o r occurs after regular t r e a t m e n t with a r e c e p t o r
antagonist, resulting in loss of efficacy of low doses of the
antagonist, a n effect o v e r c o m e by higher doses. f u r t h e r
studies n e e d to b e p e r f o r m e d to d e t e r m i n e w h e t h e r the
loss of p r o t e c t i o n afforded for t h e 10 m g dose after 1
w e e k would occur with longer periods of t r e a t m e n t at
h i g h e r doses. also, w h e t h e r loss of p r o t e c t i o n occurs
with low doses t a k e n less frequently would b e i m p o r t a n t
to know; this is b e c a u s e it is possible that low doses
t a k e n once daily would provide p r o t e c t i o n against e i b
t h r o u g h o u t the day without loss of p r o t e c t i o n with
p r o l o n g e d use.
in conclusion, this study has d e m o n s t r a t e d t h a t treatm e n t with the l t r e c e p t o r antagonist  xxxd1702xxx  protects
