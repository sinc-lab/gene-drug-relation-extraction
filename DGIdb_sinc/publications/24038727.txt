abstract
background:  xxxd3016xxx  is an anticancer agent that also inhibits  xxxg1357xxx , an enzyme
responsible for the metabolism of various catecholamines, including serotonin.
methods: a retrospective chart review of lymphoma patients who were treated with both  xxxd3016xxx 
and an antidepressant, as well as  xxxd3016xxx  alone, was performed to determine if signs and symptoms
of serotonin toxicity were present.
results: a total of 65 patients received  xxxd3016xxx  between 2004 and 2010 and were eligible to be
included in the study. twenty-six of these patients received an antidepressant in combination with
 xxxd3016xxx , with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors being the most common type of antidepressant.
no patients in the study were diagnosed with serotonin toxicity, nor did any meet hunter’s diagnostic
criteria for serotonin toxicity. diarrhea, tremor, and shivering were the symptoms from sternbach’s
criteria that were further analyzed, with diarrhea occurring 8.54% of the time, tremor occurring
5.53% of the time, and shivering occurring 2.51% of the time in patients who received an antidepressant
with their  xxxd3016xxx . despite these symptoms, the diagnosis of serotonin toxicity according to
sternbach’s criteria was determined to be unlikely.
conclusions: in this small sample of patients treated with  xxxd3016xxx  plus an antidepressant
(most typically ssris), there were no reports of serotonin toxicity, nor did any patients demonstrate
symptoms consistent with serotonin toxicity. the authors urge clinicians to ensure depression is
adequately managed in cancer patients who are undergoing  xxxd3016xxx  therapy, starting with
typical ﬁrst-line antidepressant agents.

introduction
in addition to its anticancer mechanism,  xxxd3016xxx , a drug
used in the treatment of hodgkin’s and non-hodgkin’s
lymphoma and various brain tumors, has a metabolite
demonstrating weak serotonergic activity through
nonselective inhibition of the  xxxg1357xxx  enzyme
[1,2]. the combination of a  xxxg1357xxx  inhibitor
(maoi) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri)
is the most common cause of serotonin toxicity (st), a
toxidrome that can be life-threatening [3]. the question
remains as to the clinical signiﬁcance of this interaction
among patients treated with  xxxd3016xxx . literature searches
for reports of patients who developed st from concomitant
treatment with  xxxd3016xxx  and an antidepressant revealed
no cases of an interaction. further, interaction-checking
databases provide inconsistent results when the combination
of an antidepressant with  xxxd3016xxx  is queried, ranging
from no interaction to contraindicated [3–6]. when a risk of
using concomitant therapy is recognized, this risk is cited as

ranging from theoretical to established [3–6]. based upon this
information, it appears that the concern over an interaction
is based solely on  xxxd3016xxx ’s classiﬁcation as a maoi
with no supporting clinical accounts, and the true clinical
signiﬁcance of this interaction is unclear. the information
provided by the manufacturer in regard to this interaction
did not contain any studies with  xxxd3016xxx  and antidepressants [sigma-tau pharmaceuticals, e-mail communication
july 2013]. the substantial difference in these results
provides practitioners with conﬂicting information and no
evidence-based guidance for treating depression in patients
receiving treatment with  xxxd3016xxx . this is particularly
problematic given the prevalence of comorbid mood
disorders in cancer patients. more speciﬁcally, a 2009 review
article published by roper, et al. evaluated 35 studies of
patients treated for hodgkin’s disease and estimated the
prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among this
population to be up to 50% within the ﬁrst year after diagnosis [7]. this number is signiﬁcantly higher than in the general
us population, in which an estimated 18% suffer from

 xxxd3016xxx  and antidepressants

anxiety and 9.5% from mood disorder each year [8]. further,
the majority of those experiencing mental illness are not
treated or are inadequately treated [9], highlighting the urgency of addressing mood disorders and understanding the
need for safe and effective treatments in cancer patients. serotonergic drugs such as ssris and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the medications of choice
for the treatment of depression [10–12]; however, clinicians
may be hesitant to utilize these medications due to the
theoretical risk of serotonin toxicity when these antidepressants are used in combination with  xxxd3016xxx . failure
to treat depression in this population could have devastating
effects, as cancer patients suffering from depression have an
increased rate of relapse and are less adherent to antineoplastic therapy [10]. the objective of this study is to
determine if concomitant treatment with  xxxd3016xxx  and
an antidepressant places patients with cancer at risk for
serotonin toxicity.
serotonin toxicity generally occurs when serotonergic
antidepressants are used in combination with other
serotonergic drugs. st is most likely to be fatal when ssris
are co-administered with maois [12]. following the use of
serotonergic agent(s), the onset of serotonin toxicity is rapid
and typically occurs within the ﬁrst 24 hours following
initiation, change in dose, or overdose [13]. data from the
national poison data system from 2011 notes among 46,587
exposures to ssris, there were 1,623 mild outcomes, 134
major outcomes, and 11 deaths. the majority of fatalities
reported were due to combinations of various agents [14].
the actual incidence of serotonin toxicity is not well
characterized due to lack of recognition from variations in
presentation, among other reasons [15,16].
while the gold standard of diagnosing serotonin toxicity
is via a toxicologist, the likelihood of serotonin toxicity
may be more readily assessed using sternbach’s diagnostic
criteria and the hunter serotonin toxicity criteria (hstc)
[15,17], sternbach’s criteria is an older tool in which three
or more of clinical features must be present to be considered
positive for st, as well as having a serotonergic drug
recently added to therapy or an increase in dose. these clinical features include confusion, hypomania, restlessness,
myoclonus, hyperreﬂexia, diaphoresis, shivering, tremor,
diarrhea, or incoordination [15]. the primary shortcoming
of this assessment is its lack of speciﬁcity because many
of the clinical features overlap with symptoms seen in

109

alcohol withdrawal states, catecholamine excess, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, or anticholinergic delirium, for example [18]. conversely, hstc is a newer
diagnostic technique that is considered a highly sensitive
(84%) and speciﬁc (97%) approach to st diagnosis when
compared with the gold standard [17]. this method employs a series of decision rules to assess a patient for st
based on symptom presentation, which are summarized in
figure 1 [17] and is deemed to be the most accurate criteria
available, using a more narrow range of clinical features,
most namely, clonus [16,18].

methods
sample and procedures
this retrospective cohort study was conducted at the
university of michigan health system, which includes a
990 bed university hospital. this study protocol was
approved by the university of michigan institutional review
board. eligible patients included those with cancer at the
university of michigan health system that were at least
18 years of age and had been prescribed at least once cycle
of  xxxd3016xxx  alone for the control group, or those who
were treated concomitantly with  xxxd3016xxx  and an
antidepressant between 2004 and 2010. patient demographics,  xxxd3016xxx  regimen, antidepressant regimen,
comorbidities, and coadministration of additional serotonergic medications were collected. medications that interact
with cyp 2d6 or 3a4 enzymes should also be noted as they
may impact the level of circulating antidepressant.

measures
each patient’s multidisciplinary chart was reviewed for
the signs and symptoms of st. because several conditions
have features similar to st, patients suspected to be
positive for st were further evaluated for symptoms that
would indicate another condition. because two sets of
criteria are commonly used to diagnose st, sternbach’s
diagnostic criteria and the hstc, as described earlier,
both were used to evaluate patients for st in this study.

analyses
categorical data were analyzed using chi 2 or fisher exact
test. continuous data were analyzed with the student t-test

(for dichotomous variables) or mann–whitney u-test (for
nonparametric variables). all tests were 2-sided and
p-values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
the model used for correlating serotonin toxicity symptoms was a generalized linear model with generalized estimating equations to take into account the fact that there
could be multiple  xxxd3016xxx  cycles for a given patient,
and thus, observations for the same patient could be
correlated in each cycle. all analyses were conducted
using sas software, version 9.1 (sas institute).

results
patient characteristics
a total of 65 patients received  xxxd3016xxx  between 2004
and 2010 and were eligible to be included in the study.
twenty-six of these patients also received an antidepressant.
there were slightly more males (61.5%), patients with a stage
4 diagnosis (48.7%), and more patients with lymphoma
diagnosis (53.8%) included in the study. the overall mean
age was 57.7 ± 16.7 years. patient characteristics based on
cancer diagnosis are summarized in table 1. patients with
lymphoma tended to be older, male, and have undergone
more previous chemotherapy regimens than patients with
brain tumors. the majority of lymphoma patients were stage
4, whereas the patients with brain tumors were evenly distributed amongst stages 2, 3, and 4. the average  xxxd3016xxx 
dose in patients with a brain tumor was almost double the
average daily dose of those patients with lymphoma. patient
characteristics comparing those that received an antidepressant to those that did not are summarized in table 2. the
patients who received antidepressant were more likely to

have a diagnosis of lymphoma, have had two prior
chemotherapy treatments, and be slightly younger compared
with those who did not receive an antidepressant, although
none of these differences were statistically signiﬁcant. of
the 26 who received an antidepressant, ssris were the most
common type (53.8%), followed by either mirtazapine or
trazodone (23.1% and classiﬁed as other), followed by
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (19.2%),
and only one patient received a tricyclic antidepressant. no
patients received maois as treatment for depression.
speciﬁcally, seven patients received trazodone, six patients
received citalopram, four patients received venlafaxine,
three patients received sertraline, two patients received
escitalopram, and one patient each received amitriptyline,
mirtazapine, imipramine, and paroxetine. all of the trazodone patients were receiving it for sleep. the patient receiving imipramine was receiving it to treat urinary symptoms.
the individual dosing are demonstrated in table 3. in those
patients receiving both antidepressant and  xxxd3016xxx , the
reason of mortality for discontinuation of  xxxd3016xxx  was
higher than those patients receiving  xxxd3016xxx  alone,
although this was not statistically signiﬁcant.

evaluation of serotonin toxicity
no patients were positive for st according to hunter’s
criteria. diarrhea, tremor, and shivering were the symptoms from sternbach’s criteria that were further analyzed,
because these symptoms are not likely to be related to the
patient’s condition but may be more closely associated
with antidepressant use. no patients were positive for
hyperreﬂexia or hypomania. patients who were positive
for agitation, diaphoresis, ataxia, confusion, or myoclonus
had many other confounding factors and were deemed by
the provider in the medical chart to be multifactorial and/
or due to disease, infection or other causes. of the patients
who received an antidepressant concomitantly with their
 xxxd3016xxx , diarrhea occurred 8.54% of the time, tremor
occurred 5.53% of the time, and shivering occurred 2.51%
of the time. tremor and shivering occurred simultaneously 1.01% of the time, diarrhea and tremor occurred
together 0.5% of the time, and all three occurred 0.5% of
the time. although the presence of all three occurred 0.5%
of the time, other etiologies could not be ruled out. thus,
the diagnosis of serotonin toxicity according to sternbach’s
criteria was determined to be unlikely. there were a total of
18 patients that experienced diarrhea, tremor, or shivering.
nine of these patients were on an antidepressant
concomitantly with their  xxxd3016xxx  and 8 of the 18
patients had a brain tumor as their cancer diagnosis. three
of these nine patients were taking citalopram, two were taking trazodone, and the remaining patients were individually
taking sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine.
ten of 18 patients had stage 4 diagnosis, and 5 of the 18
had received four or more prior cancer treatments. the

average dose of  xxxd3016xxx  for these 18 patients was
73.1 ± 71.2 mg/day each cycle. reason for discontinuation
of the  xxxd3016xxx  was progression of disease (44.44%),
intolerability (33.33%), death (16.67%), or completed
treatment (5.56%). of the patients who discontinued
 xxxd3016xxx  due to intolerability, none were due to
diarrhea, tremor, or shivering. there was no correlation

between these symptoms and diagnosis,  xxxd3016xxx  dose,
number of prior chemotherapy cycles, nor stage at diagnosis.

discussion
no patients in the study were diagnosed with serotonin
toxicity, nor did any meet hunter’s diagnostic criteria for
serotonin toxicity. there were several limitations to this
study. first, our sample size was small because  xxxd3016xxx  is not a ﬁrst-line chemotherapy agent, and its use is
relatively uncommon. second, because this was a retrospective study, patient evaluation was limited to the notes
recorded in medical records. a prospective design would
allow a far more thorough assessment of signs and symptoms of serotonin toxicity. this would also allow for more
accurate start and stop dates of  xxxd3016xxx , antidepressants, and other medications. another consideration is
the signiﬁcant overlap in symptoms of progression of
central nervous system (cns) cancers and serotonin
toxicity. cns malignancies often cause patients to exhibit
confusion, agitation, seizures, tremor ,and incoordination,
all features consistent with st. we collected stage at diagnosis to further delineate if symptoms were related to
advanced disease versus a potential drug interaction.
distinguishing st in patients on chemotherapy is even
more difﬁcult, as anticancer drugs can elicit additional
st-like symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and changes
in blood pressure. had there been severe symptoms
concerning for an interaction, we expect that these would
have been reported in the medical record. because
symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea can be dose related
with  xxxd3016xxx  [19], our ﬁnding that there wasn’t a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in mean dose between
those with or without an antidepressant further supports
that nausea and diarrhea were due to disease or other
factors and less likely related to a drug interaction.
although mild symptoms of st may have occurred without being attributed to the  xxxd3016xxx -antidepressant
drug interaction, the authors feel  xxxd3016xxx  can be
safely used concomitantly with ﬁrst-line antidepressants,
provided patients are appropriately monitored.
in addition to the symptom overlap, a number of conditions exhibit features similar to st, including neuroleptic
malignant syndrome, anticholinergic delirium, cns infection, and malignant hyperthermia. while evaluating charts
for st symptoms, these differential diagnoses were

considered and ruled out. the authors did not examine
speciﬁc diagnosis of infection and steroid-induced psychosis.
because patients on immunosuppressive medications are at
increased risk for infection and are frequently treated with
steroids, these should have been considered during data
collection. however, when symptoms of either condition
appeared these were noted. although not statistically signiﬁcant, the mortality rate was higher in patients who were
receiving both  xxxd3016xxx  and an antidepressant. it is
difﬁcult to explain this result due to the retrospective nature
of the study and the small sample size with the  xxxd3016xxx 
with an antidepressant group having the smaller denominator
compared with the  xxxd3016xxx  alone group. additionally,
the  xxxd3016xxx  with an antidepressant group has more
lymphoma patients than the  xxxd3016xxx  alone group.
 xxxd3016xxx  is often used in patients in lymphoma who cannot tolerate traditional therapy due to comorbidities and who
have exhausted other treatment modalities [20,21].
one important observation made while performing this
study was the counseling provided to patients starting
 xxxd3016xxx . multiple chart notes indicated that patients
were instructed to follow strict dietary limitations, including avoidance of cheese, chocolate, and alcohol. the
intention is presumably to limit tyramine, an amine whose
metabolism is inhibited by  xxxd3016xxx  and accumulation
can lead to hypertensive crisis. the accuracy and consistency of education regarding tyramine restriction varied
signiﬁcantly among prescribers. several factors may limit
the risk of dietary tyramine to patients receiving
 xxxd3016xxx . one such factor includes the extent to which
 xxxd3016xxx  inhibits  xxxg1357xxx , which is
unclear but appears to be relatively low. another aspect
of  xxxd3016xxx  treatment that may reduce the risk of these
foods is the cyclical schedule that is utilized in many
 xxxd3016xxx -containing chemotherapy regimens. short
cycles are likely to give the body time to eliminate
excessive tyramine. instructing patients to avoid foods
that they enjoy can further reduce their quality of life. it
is also necessary to consider the nutritional deﬁciencies
of patients receiving chemotherapy or with cancers that
reduce appetite. patients often ﬁnd eating difﬁcult, and
adding unnecessary restrictions or associating food with
fear or danger may increase the risk for nutritional deﬁcits.
it is unclear if this education on tyramine restriction is
necessary, and one paper suggests that dietary restrictions
are not clinically indicated [22].
another practice that was occasionally included in chart
notes was instructing patients to hold antidepressants
during  xxxd3016xxx  treatment. this suggestion stems
from the need to stop all antidepressants at least 2 weeks
prior to initiation of an maoi, with the exception of
ﬂuoxetine, which requires at least a 5-week washout
period due to the long half-life, to avoid potentially fatal
consequences like serotonin syndrome or hypertensive
crisis [12]. the documentation indicated that some
copyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.

patients were told to stop their antidepressant ‘15 days
around’  xxxd3016xxx , and others were advised to stop
taking the antidepressant the day  xxxd3016xxx  was initiated without mention of a taper in order to discontinue
the antidepressant. many patients on antidepressants
appear to have been given no instruction to discontinue
their antidepressant and were allowed to continue their
medication during  xxxd3016xxx  treatment. the inconsistencies among these recommendations, as well as the appropriateness of these recommendations, are concerning.
for example, if an antidepressant would be held at initiation, the washout would not be adequate, and it would
likely not impact the risk of serotonin toxicity, if a true
risk exists. further, these examples highlight the needed
for provider of education regarding the risk for the interaction as well as strategies to minimize this risk. further, it
should be noted that patients receiving  xxxd3016xxx  with
or without an antidepressant should also be monitored
for worsening or new psychiatric symptoms. the product
labeling notes potential psychiatric effects of  xxxd3016xxx 
include hallucinations, depression, nervousness, apprehension, nightmares, and confusion [23]. it is unclear if
 xxxd3016xxx  itself may precipitate the need for an
intervention to manage depression. therefore, close
monitoring is critical if  xxxd3016xxx  is initiated alone or
in combination with an antidepressant, or if the antidepressant is discontinued in the setting of  xxxd3016xxx 
use. the results of this study, although of a small sample,
suggest that the risk of serotonin toxicity posed by the
interaction between  xxxd3016xxx  and antidepressants is
not likely worth the risk to a patient’s mental health posed
by discontinuing antidepressant treatment. with that said,
if continuation of the patient’s antidepressant treatment is
not warranted at the time  xxxd3016xxx  is to be initiated, it
would be judicious to abide by the recommended
antidepressant washout periods.

conclusion
in this small sample of patients treated with  xxxd3016xxx 
plus an antidepressant (most typically ssris), there were
no reports of serotonin toxicity observed, nor did any patient
meet diagnostic criteria for st. the authors urge clinicians
to ensure depression is adequately managed in cancer
patients who are undergoing  xxxd3016xxx  therapy,
starting with typical ﬁrst-line antidepressant agents or
psychotherapy, as appropriate. although there is a risk
of serotonin toxicity due to  xxxd3016xxx ’s weak maoi
activity, to our knowledge, there has been no clinical cases
published reporting on such an interaction. clinicians must
assess the risk for drug interactions when making treatment
decisions, as always. however,  xxxd3016xxx ’s inhibition of
 xxxg1357xxx  should not dissuade prescribers from
addressing a patient’s depressive symptoms, whether it is with
pharmacologic or behavioral therapy, ensuring close

monitoring ensues and high risk antidepressants, like other
monamine oxidase inhibitors, are avoided. further, patients
and caregivers should be provided with both verbal and
written information detailing the signs and symptoms of
serotonin toxicity, although the suspected risk is low.
