abstract
human  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).  xxxd3118xxx , a
human  xxxg1598xxx  activator, is in clinical trials for treatment of ibd and
has demonstrated efficacy in crohn’s disease and active ulcerative colitis. in the current study, the protective and therapeutic
role of  xxxd3118xxx  in ibd and its respective mechanism were
investigated.  xxxg1598xxx -humanized (hpxr), wild-type, and  xxxg1598xxx -null
mice were treated with  xxxd3118xxx  in the  xxxd1860xxx  sodium
(dss)-induced and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced ibd models to determine the protective function of human  xxxg1598xxx  activation in ibd. the therapeutic role of  xxxd3118xxx  was
further evaluated in dss-treated hpxr and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice. results demonstrated that preadministration of  xxxd3118xxx  ameliorated the clinical hallmarks of colitis in dss- and tnbs-treated

hpxr mice as determined by body weight loss and assessment
of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon length, and histology. in
addition, higher survival rates and recovery from colitis symptoms were observed in hpxr mice, but not in  xxxg1598xxx -null mice,
when  xxxd3118xxx  was administered after the onset of symptoms.
nuclear factor ␬b (nf-␬b) target genes were markedly downregulated in hpxr mice by  xxxd3118xxx  treatment. in vitro nf-␬b
reporter assays demonstrated inhibition of nf-␬b activity after
 xxxd3118xxx  treatment in colon-derived cell lines expressing hpxr.
these findings demonstrated the preventive and therapeutic
role of  xxxd3118xxx  on ibd through human  xxxg1598xxx -mediated inhibition
of the nf-␬b signaling cascade, thus suggesting that human
 xxxg1598xxx  may be an effective target for the treatment of ibd.

have also indicated the potential role for  xxxd3118xxx  in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) (day and gearry, 2010).  xxxd3118xxx  seems to have more efficacy in the therapy of irritable
bowel syndrome than do other antibiotics such as neomycin,
doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin(yang
et al., 2008). other studies revealed that two-thirds of adult
patients with crohn’s disease entered remission after  xxxd3118xxx  therapy (shafran and burgunder, 2010). a retrospective
review revealed a well tolerated and favorable role for  xxxd3118xxx  in pediatric ibd (muniyappa et al., 2009; trehan et al.,
2009). however, the role of  xxxd3118xxx  in irritable bowel syndrome and ibd therapy and its mechanisms of action are not
understood.
a previous study demonstrated that  xxxd3118xxx  is a gut-

 xxxd3118xxx  protects against ibd via human  xxxg1598xxx 

materials and methods
animals. hpxr, wild-type, and  xxxg1598xxx -null male mice were housed
in temperature- and light-controlled rooms and given water and
pelleted chow ad libitum. the hpxr mice express the human  xxxg1598xxx  in
the  xxxg1598xxx -null background. all animal experiments were carried out in
accordance with the institute of laboratory animal resources guidelines and approved by the national cancer institute animal care
and use committee.

experimental design. two- to 3-month-old hpxr, wild-type,
and  xxxg1598xxx -null male mice were subjected to dss- and tnbs-induced
ibd models. mice were placed into four groups (n ⱖ 6 per group) in
the dss-induced ibd study: control, dss,  xxxd3118xxx  or rifampicin,
and dss treatment after  xxxd3118xxx  or rifampicin pretreatment. the
control and dss groups received a control diet for 11 consecutive
days, and mice in the  xxxd3118xxx  (salix pharmaceuticals, inc., morrisville, nc) or rifampicin (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) groups
received  xxxd3118xxx  (1 mg/kg/day) or rifampicin (3 mg/kg/day or 10
mg/kg/day), respectively, in the diet for 11 consecutive days. dosages
of  xxxd3118xxx  or rifampicin were calculated based on mouse daily
dietary intake. mice in the  xxxd3118xxx  and dss or rifampicin and dss
groups received the compounds in the diet for 11 days, and on the 5th
day of treatment the mice were administered 2.5% dss (mp biomedicals, solon, oh) in drinking water (wt/v), and all mice were
killed 11 days after treatment with the  xxxd3118xxx  or rifampicin diets
or the control diet. serum samples were collected by retro-orbital
bleeding. hpxr and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice were used for the therapeutic
studies (n ⱖ 10 per group) in which mice were treated with 2.5% dss
and control diet for 5 consecutive days, then dss was withdrawn and
 xxxd3118xxx  was administered and compared with vehicle-treated mice.
the mice were observed for 7 consecutive days after the onset of
 xxxd3118xxx  treatment. the tnbs-induced ibd protocol was also used
to confirm the role of  xxxd3118xxx  and human  xxxg1598xxx  in ibd (n ⱖ 6 per
group). a 2-mg aliquot of tnbs in 50% ethanol was administered
intrarectally to anesthetized mice via a round-bottom (50.8 mm)
needle (popper, lake success, ny), followed by control diet or  xxxd3118xxx  diet treatment for 6 consecutive days. the mice were killed 5
days after tnbs administration, and the colons were flushed and
resected. all of the above ibd studies were repeated twice. all mice
were killed by co2 asphyxiation at the end of the study, and tissue
samples were harvested and stored at ⫺80°c before analysis.
colitis evaluation. daily changes of body weight, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and bloody stool were assessed and reported as a score
from 0 to 4. for assessment of macroscopic colon damage, the colon
was opened longitudinally, flushed with phosphate-buffered saline,
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. colitis was measured by blinded
analysis on a routine hematoxylin and eosin (h&e)-stained section
according to the morphological criteria described previously (cooper
et al., 1993).
rna analysis. rna was isolated and mrna expression was
assessed by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) as described previously (cheng et al., 2009).
cell lines and luciferase assays. human epithelial colorectal
adenocarcinoma cells (caco-2) and human colonic epithelial cells
(ht-29) were grown at 37°c with 5% co2 in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (gemini bio-products, woodland, ca) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (invitrogen). caco-2 and ht-29 cells were
seeded at a density of 5 ⫻ 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. expression
vectors for human  xxxg1598xxx , retinoid x receptor (rxr), and nf-␬b luciferase reporters were transfected into cells by using the fugene
transfection reagent (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in). twentyfour hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with dmso
(vehicle) or  xxxd3118xxx  for 24 h, followed by incubation with tumor
necrosis factor ␣ (tnf␣) (10 ng /ml) for 24 h. a standard dual
luciferase assay was used and normalized to a cotransfected control
reporter plasmid (promega, madison, wi).
protein analysis of human  xxxg1598xxx  and microsomal stearoylcoa desaturase-1. fresh colon tissues were collected, and epithelial cells isolated. nuclear protein was isolated with a ne-per kit
(thermo fisher scientific, rockford, il). liver tissues were collected
and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (1.15% kcl, 50 mm tris-hcl, and
1 mm edta, ph 7.4) and microsomes were prepared by differential
centrifugation. pellets were resuspended in 100 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.4), 0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 m kcl, and 20% (v/v)
glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at ⫺80°c. primary antibodies to human  xxxg1598xxx  (h5017) and  xxxg2014xxx -1 (scd-1) (santa

specific human  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) agonist (ma et al.,
2007b).  xxxg1598xxx  is a ligand-activated transcription factor important for its induction of drug transport and metabolism, in
particular induction of the cytochrome p450 cyp3a4 involved in the metabolism of many clinically used drugs. recent data indicate that  xxxg1598xxx  may be involved in ibd. gene
expression analysis of colon tissues from ulcerative colitis
and patients with crohn’s disease demonstrated a significant
inhibition of  xxxg1598xxx  and its target genes compared with normal
intestinal samples (langmann et al., 2004). specific polymorphisms in the  xxxg1598xxx  locus that are associated with a
decrease in  xxxg1598xxx  activity are correlated with an increased
susceptibility to ibd (dring et al., 2006).  xxxg1598xxx  inhibits the
proinflammatory transcription factor nf-␬b, providing a
potential molecular mechanism that links  xxxg1598xxx  signaling
and inflammation (xie and tian, 2006; zhou et al., 2006a).
for example, activation of mouse  xxxg1598xxx  ameliorates dextran
sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis via inhibition of nf-␬b
(shah et al., 2007). however,  xxxg1598xxx  ligands are structurally
diverse and as noted above display species specificity (ma et
al., 2008). rifampicin [3-(4-methylpiperazinyliminomethyl)
rifamycin sv] is an agonist for human  xxxg1598xxx  but does not
activate rodent  xxxg1598xxx , whereas pregnenolone-16␣-carbonitrile, a rodent-specific  xxxg1598xxx  agonist, does not activate human
 xxxg1598xxx  (zhou et al., 2009). because of the specific activation of
 xxxd3118xxx  on human  xxxg1598xxx , the role of this drug in therapy of
ibd has been a focus of interest.
in the current study, the preventive and therapeutic role of
 xxxd3118xxx  was assessed in dss- or tnbs-induced ibd models. rifampicin (ma et al., 2007b), as another rifamycinderived antibiotic and human  xxxg1598xxx  agonist (bertilsson et al.,
1998), was compared with  xxxd3118xxx . because rodent models
cannot accurately predict inducers and potential drug– drug
interactions mediated by human  xxxg1598xxx  due to different responses to  xxxg1598xxx  ligands (jones et al., 2000),  xxxg1598xxx -humanized
(hpxr) mice were used to investigate the potential role of
human  xxxg1598xxx  activation in the mouse ibd models. the hpxr
mice express human  xxxg1598xxx  in the  xxxg1598xxx -null background and
respond only to human  xxxg1598xxx -specific ligands (ma et al.,
2007a). wild-type (wt) and  xxxg1598xxx -null mouse lines were also
assessed to distinguish the antibiotic role from its  xxxg1598xxx  ligand effect. rifampicin treatment demonstrated no protection against mouse ibd and exacerbated the severity of ibd.
however, the hpxr mice treated with  xxxd3118xxx  demonstrated significant protection and a potential therapeutic role
of human  xxxg1598xxx  in ibd. no protection of  xxxd3118xxx  was observed in wild-type and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice, thus demonstrating
that  xxxd3118xxx  functions through activating human  xxxg1598xxx  and
not through its gut-specific antibiotic effects. in addition,
 xxxd3118xxx  inhibited the nf-␬b signaling cascade in a human
 xxxg1598xxx -dependent manner. these data provide the first mechanistic evidence by which  xxxd3118xxx  and human  xxxg1598xxx  influence experimental ibd.

results
rifampicin does not protect hpxr mice in the dssinduced colitis model. rifampicin is a derivative antibiotic of rifamycin sv, which is a systemic drug widely studied
as a typical human  xxxg1598xxx  agonist. long-term treatment in
tuberculosis therapy is thought to increase hepatotoxicity
(tostmann et al., 2008). here, rifampicin was investigated
for the treatment of dss-induced colitis. effective dosages of
3 mg/kg/day (xie et al., 2000) and 10 mg/kg/day were selected
(cheng et al., 2009). hpxr mice pretreated with rifampicin
followed by dss treatment demonstrated no protection
against dss-induced colitis compared with dss treatment
alone. no significant changes were observed in control and
rifampicin-treated (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) mice in the absence of
dss. it is noteworthy that high doses of rifampicin, combined
with dss, led to more severe colitis compared with coadministration of low dosage of rifampicin with dss as revealed by
decreased body weight and increased diarrhea and rectal
bleeding scores (fig. 1). expression of hepatic scd-1, a lipogenic enzyme regulated by  xxxg1598xxx  (zhou et al., 2006b), which is
protective in ibd (chen et al., 2008), was repressed at the
mrna and protein levels after dss alone. whereas 3 mg/kg/
day rifampicin treatment combined with dss did not alter
these low levels, expression was markedly reduced with 10
mg/kg/day of the drug (supplemental fig. 1). this reduction
of scd-1 was associated with a reduction of unsaturated
lysophosphatidylcholine in plasma. human  xxxg1598xxx  target
genes in liver and colon were induced and proinflammatory
factors were unchanged by rifampicin in the dss ibd model
(supplemental fig. 2).
 xxxd3118xxx  protects hpxr mice in the dss-induced
colitis model. unlike rifampicin,  xxxd3118xxx  is a nonsystemic
antibiotic not significantly absorbed into the circulation. the
preventive role of  xxxd3118xxx  was assessed in the dss-induced
colitis model. no significant changes were observed in the
colon after  xxxd3118xxx  treatment alone in hpxr, wt, and
 xxxg1598xxx -null mice compared with the control groups (supplemen-

metabolomics analysis of serum. a 1-␮l aliquot of diluted
serum samples was injected into a waters (milford, ma) uplctofms system. an acquity uplc beh c18 column (waters) was
used to separate chemical components at 35°c. the mobile-phase
flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with an aqueous acetonitrile gradient
containing 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  over a 10-min run (0% acetonitrile for
0.5 min to 20% acetonitrile by 5 min to 95% acetonitrile by 9 min,
then equilibration at 100% water for 1 min before the next injection). the qtof premier mass spectrometer (waters) was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode. capillary voltage and cone voltage were maintained at 3 kv and 20 v,
respectively. source temperature and desolvation temperature
were set at 120 and 350°c, respectively. nitrogen was used as
both cone gas (50 l/h) and desolvation gas (600 l/h), and argon was
used as collision gas. for accurate mass measurement, the time of
flight mass spectrometry was calibrated with sodium formate
solution (range m/z 100-1000) and monitored by the intermittent
injection of the lock mass sulfadimethoxine ([m ⫹ h]⫹ ⫽ 311.0814

were acquired and processed by masslynx software (waters) in

principal components analysis of serum metabolomic
data. chromatographic and spectral data were deconvoluted by
markerlynx software (waters). a multivariate data matrix containing information on sample identity, ion identity (retention time and

each ion was calculated by normalizing the single ion counts versus
the total ion counts in the whole chromatogram. the data matrix was
further exported into simca-p software (umetrics, kinnelon, nj)
and transformed by mean-centering and pareto scaling, a technique
that increases the importance of low abundance ions without significant amplification of noise. principal components of serum were
generated by principal components analysis to represent the major
latent variables in the data matrix and were described in a scores

 xxxd3118xxx  may be acting locally in the colon and not systemically to decrease the severity of dss-induced colitis.
 xxxd3118xxx  protects tnbs-induced ibd in hpxr
mice. to confirm results from the dss-induced colitis model,
an additional acute colitis model was used. the tnbs-induced ibd model is driven by an initial il-12 and tnf␣
response of lymphoid cells (strober et al., 2009). the tnbsinduced ibd model was initiated in hpxr mice by intrarectal
administration of tnbs after  xxxd3118xxx  pretreatment. tnbs
triggered weight loss, bloody diarrhea, rectal prolapse, and
large bowel wall thickening.  xxxd3118xxx  significantly improved colon histology (fig. 3a) and body weight (fig. 3b)
and maintained colon length (fig. 3c) in hpxr mice,
whereas no protection was observed in wt and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice
(data not shown). thus, with a second mouse ibd model,
these data further indicate that  xxxd3118xxx  protects against
ibd in hpxr mice.
 xxxd3118xxx  exerts therapeutic efficacy in the dssinduced colitis model in hpxr mice. in addition to a
preventive role of  xxxd3118xxx , a therapeutic study was performed in dss-induced hpxr and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice. acute colitis
was induced by 2.5% dss treatment for 5 days.  xxxd3118xxx  (1
mg/kg/day) was administrated to hpxr and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice
after the onset of ibd. survival rates were markedly increased in hpxr mice (p ⫽ 0.011) compared with  xxxg1598xxx -null
mice (p ⫽ 0.730) administered  xxxd3118xxx  after the withdrawal of dss (fig. 4a). clear signs of recovery from colitis
were noted in hpxr mice administered  xxxd3118xxx  (fig. 4b),
such as increased colon length (p ⫽ 0.002) and increased
body weight compared with controls. a significant resolution

tal fig. 3). in contrast, dss treatment increased crypt and
epithelial cell damage, infiltration of granulocytes and mononuclear immune cells, and tissue edema in hpxr mice. it is
noteworthy that  xxxd3118xxx  pretreatment significantly attenuated dss-induced colon damage in hpxr mice compared
with dss treatment alone (fig. 2a), as noted by an observed
decrease in epithelial loss and mild inflammation.  xxxd3118xxx 
did not protect dss-induced colitis in wild-type and  xxxg1598xxx -null
mice as assessed by colon histology. in addition, several
clinical parameters of colitis were statistically improved with
 xxxd3118xxx  pretreatment in hpxr mice, such as daily body
weight loss, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and colon length compared with dss administration alone (fig. 2b). meanwhile,
there was no protection in wt and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice treated with
dss and  xxxd3118xxx  compared with dss alone as revealed by
clinical indexes of colitis, including body weight, rectal bleeding scores and diarrhea scores, and colon length (supplemental fig. 4). these results suggest that the beneficial effects of
 xxxd3118xxx  may be attributed to its specific activation of human  xxxg1598xxx , high bioavailability in the intestine, and decreased
toxicity compared with rifampicin. to ensure that the protective role of  xxxd3118xxx  in acute colitis is not via inducing
hepatic scd-1, western blot analysis of hepatic microsomal
scd-1 was performed.  xxxd3118xxx  alone had no effect on
scd-1 expression in hpxr, wild-type, or  xxxg1598xxx -null mice,
whereas 2.5% dss administration clearly repressed scd-1
expression in hpxr, wild-type, or  xxxg1598xxx -null mice compared
with control (supplemental fig. 5a). moreover, serum
metabolomics analysis demonstrated that  xxxd3118xxx -treated
hpxr, wild-type, and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice have similar profiles of
score plots and loading plots as determined by principal
components analysis (supplemental fig. 5b), suggesting that

hpxr mice (fig. 4c). no significant protection was afforded
in  xxxg1598xxx -null mice treated with  xxxd3118xxx  with respect to survival (fig. 4d) or improvement of clinical signs (fig. 4e)
compared with hpxr mice.
 xxxd3118xxx  activates hpxr target genes in the colon. human  xxxg1598xxx  expression in colons was measured by qpcr
(fig. 5a) and western blot (fig. 5b). mouse ␤-actin served as an
internal control for qpcr mrna analysis, and  xxxg1065xxx ␣ served as
an internal control for western blot analysis. human  xxxg1598xxx  was
expressed in the colons of hpxr mice; however, the expression was
significantly less than that observed in the liver. previous work
demonstrated that  xxxd3118xxx  is a human  xxxg1598xxx  agonist in the small
intestine (ma et al., 2007b). to assess the potential function of
 xxxd3118xxx  as a  xxxg1598xxx  ligand in the colon, qpcr analysis of mouse
cyp3a11, cyp3a13,  xxxg983xxx , and mdr1a genes in colon was investigated. the expression of cyp3a11, cyp3a13,  xxxg983xxx , and mdr1a
mrnas was increased in hpxr mice after  xxxd3118xxx  treatment
compared with the control group (fig. 6), whereas there was no
induction of cyp3a11, cyp3a13,  xxxg983xxx , and mdr1a mrnas in
wild-type and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice after  xxxd3118xxx  treatment. together,
these data demonstrate that  xxxd3118xxx  is a human  xxxg1598xxx  agonist in
the colon.
activation of hpxr by  xxxd3118xxx  inhibits nf-␬b target gene expression. nf-␬b is the central transcription

factor in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines. previous studies demonstrated that activation
of  xxxg1598xxx  can attenuate nf-␬b signaling (xie and tian, 2006).
to elucidate the potential function of nf-␬b on protection of

tnf␣ (10 ng/ml) induced nf-␬b activation, which was significantly attenuated after cotransfection with human  xxxg1598xxx 
and rxr constructs. these data revealed that human  xxxg1598xxx 
could inhibit tnf␣-induced inflammation. the addition of 1
and 100 ␮m  xxxd3118xxx  potentiated the repression of nf-␬b
activation after tnf␣ treatment (fig. 8a). the significant
inhibition of nf-␬b activity after  xxxd3118xxx  treatment in the
absence of human  xxxg1598xxx  transfection might be caused by basal
expression of human  xxxg1598xxx  in ht-29 and caco-2 cells as assessed by western blot analysis (data not shown). moreover,

a dose response of  xxxd3118xxx  on nf-␬b inhibition was evaluated in ht-29 cells. these results showed that the optimal
inhibition dosage of  xxxd3118xxx  was between 0.01 and 1 ␮m
(fig. 8b). consistent with the in vivo results, the in vitro
luciferase assay indicated that  xxxd3118xxx  protected hpxr
mice from acute colitis through nf-␬b inhibition via gutspecific human  xxxg1598xxx  activation.

the etiology of ibd is still not completely understood;
however, it is widely accepted that the development of ibd is
associated with the interplay of genetic, bacterial, and environmental factors and dysregulation of the intestinal immune system (kaser et al., 2010). among the ibd models,
chemically induced animal models are commonly used, particularly with dss colitis and hapten-induced colitis, using
either dnbs/tnbs or oxazolone. these two models produce
robust and immediate inflammation in the colon and have
high reproducibility (hoffmann et al., 2002). in the present
study, acute colitis was induced by dss and tnbs administration. despite the acute nature of these models, they
clearly show the impact of human  xxxg1598xxx  and  xxxd3118xxx  and
suggest its clinical utility.
the treatment of ibd is highly individualized; however, in
most cases the first-line therapy uses immune-suppressing
drugs, which act systemically.  xxxd3118xxx , an efficient gut-specific antibiotic because of its zwitterionic property, which inhibits absorption into the systemic circulation (marchi et al., 1985),
has been shown to be beneficial in specific cases of ibd
(gionchetti et al., 2006). using a mouse model that accurately
expresses human  xxxg1598xxx , the present study clearly demonstrates
that  xxxd3118xxx  protects through a  xxxg1598xxx -dependent mechanism
and not as a general antibiotic in both dss- and tnbs-induced
ibd. in the therapeutic study, no mice in the dss group survived, whereas  xxxd3118xxx  administered after treatment with
dss resolved the colitis symptoms and led to 60% survival. the
resolution of inflammation in acute models of colitis is not
completely understood; however, these data provide evidence
that  xxxd3118xxx  and hpxr might be worthwhile for the treatment of human ibd.
it is noteworthy that a well known human  xxxg1598xxx  agonist,
rifampicin, which is a systemic antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, demonstrated an increase in hepatotoxicity when
administered before treatment with dss and provided no
significant protection of hpxr mice in the dss-induced colitis model. rifampicin treatment in the colitis model actually
slightly increased the severity of symptoms such as body
weight loss and diarrhea score. this was quite unexpected
because pregnenolone-16␣-carbonitrile, which also induces
 xxxg1598xxx  target genes in liver and colon, protects against dssinduced ibd (shah et al., 2007). the reason for the differences between the protective effect of  xxxd3118xxx  and rifampicin in experimental ibd is not understood. because both
drugs can induce  xxxg1598xxx  target genes in the intestine, the
difference is not caused by the increase in the availability of
 xxxd3118xxx  in the gut compared with rifampicin. further experimentation is required to determine the reason for the
lack of effect of rifampicin on dss-induced colitis in the
hpxr mouse. it was reported that rifampicin led to several
pseudomembranous colitis cases (akbar et al., 2003; mazokopakis et al., 2008; chen et al., 2009) and has been associated
with adverse effects in patients with chronic inflammatory
diseases (yuhas et al., 2009). it is noteworthy that rifampicin
administered with dss markedly lowered the already suppressed scd-1 protein and the serum levels of unsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  compared with dss alone. the current results in

2009). because mouse  xxxg1598xxx  was reported to ameliorate dssinduced ibd by nf-␬b inhibition, it was critical to investigate the mechanism by which human  xxxg1598xxx  was protective in
an acute colitis model. in vivo data demonstrated several
nf-␬b target genes to be significantly attenuated in hpxr
mice after  xxxd3118xxx  pretreatment and dss treatment compared with dss treatment alone, and the attenuation of
nf-␬b signaling by  xxxd3118xxx  was not observed in wild-type
and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice. consistent with the in vivo data, in vitro
evaluation of  xxxd3118xxx  on nf-␬b inhibition suggested a direct role for human  xxxg1598xxx  in the inhibition of nf-␬b signaling.
analysis of nf-␬b response in colon-derived cancer cells
using the nf-␬b response element demonstrated a significant induction with tnf␣ treatment, which was inhibited
after overexpression of human  xxxg1598xxx , and the inhibition was
further potentiated in the presence of  xxxd3118xxx . it was assumed that transrepression of nf-␬b target genes might be
mediated by the sumoylation of  xxxg1598xxx  (zhou et al., 2006b),
and, nf-␬b disrupted binding of the  xxxg1598xxx –rxr complex to its
binding motif (gu et al., 2006).
in summary, the hpxr mice were used to demonstrate the
beneficial effects of  xxxd3118xxx  in acute models of colitis
through the activation of human  xxxg1598xxx , and a critical role for
 xxxg1598xxx  in ibd. in addition, these data provide a mechanistic
basis for novel therapies targeting human  xxxg1598xxx  in the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the gut.
