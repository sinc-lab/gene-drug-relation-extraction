abstract: a novel dna modification system by sulfur (s) in streptomyces lividans 66 was reported to
be encoded by a cluster of five genes designated dnda-e [zhou, x., he, x., liang, j., li, a., xu, t.,
kieser, t., helmann, j. d., and deng, z. (2005) mol. microbiol. 57, 1428-1438]. the dnda gene was
cloned and the protein product expressed in escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized
as a homodimeric protein of ca. 91 kda. purified dnda has a yellow color and uv-visible spectra
characteristic of a  xxxd3047xxx -containing enzyme and was proven to be a cysteine desulfurase
able to catalyze removal of elemental s atoms from l-cysteine to produce l-alanine with substrate specificity
similar to that of e. coli  xxxg1562xxx . dndc was also purified to homogeneity and found to contain a 4fe-4s
cluster by spectral analysis and have obvious atp pyrophosphatase activity. dnda could catalyze ironsulfur cluster assembly by activation of apo-fe dndc protein prepared by removal of its iron-sulfur
cluster using r,r′-dipyridyl. a mutated dnda, with serine substituted for cysteine at position 327, which
was confirmed to have lost its corresponding cysteine desulfurase activity, also lost its ability to reactivate
the apo-fe dndc. the likely involvement of an interaction between dnda and dndc in the biochemical
pathway for the unusual site-specific dna modification in s. lividans 66 is discussed.

cysteine desulfurase ( xxxg1562xxx ) is a pyridoxal 5′phosphate (plp)1 dependent homodimeric enzyme that
catalyzes the formation of l-alanine and elemental s by using
l-cysteine as substrate. the enzymatic activity was first
described for the  xxxg1562xxx  protein from a diazotrophic bacterium,
azotobacter vinelandi. the  xxxg1562xxx  protein is involved in
nitrogenase iron-sulfur cluster formation (1).  xxxg1562xxx -like
proteins, called  xxxg1562xxx , were later observed in a. vinelandii
(2).  xxxg1562xxx  has been found not only in diazotrophs but also in
nondiazotrophic microorganisms.  xxxg1562xxx  homologues are highly
conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes and are required
for the viability of organisms such as escherichia coli (3,
4), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (5), bacillus
subtilis (6), synechocystis sp. (7), helicobacter pylori (8),
saccharomyces cerevisiae (9), and arabidopsis thaliana (10).
most organisms have more than one copy of a  xxxg1562xxx 
homologue. e. coli contains three genes with sequence
homology to a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx , which were named  xxxg1562xxx ,
csda, and sufs (csdb). the deduced  xxxg1562xxx  protein is 40%
identical to a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx , but sufs and csda are only

24% identical to  xxxg1562xxx  (11). these enzymes are classified
into two groups, based on the sequence similarity of a motif
in the active site that contains a conserved cysteine (4). by
this criterion, e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  is a group i enzyme, whereas sufs
and csda are members of group ii. genetic experiments
have generally revealed important or essential functions for
 xxxg1562xxx  homologues. disruption of the e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  gene results
in multiple auxotrophies and severely reduced activity of
iron-sulfur cluster enzymes (12). although deletion of suf
causes no observable growth defects in e. coli, such mutants
are clearly more sensitive to iron starvation than isc mutants.
the sufs gene is part of the suf operon, which is thought to
contribute to iron-sulfur cluster formation under conditions
of stress (13). in addition, the auxotrophies associated with
deletion of the entire isc cluster in e. coli could be corrected
by overexpression of the suf operon, suggesting that the suf
and isc genes have overlapping functions in iron-sulfur
protein biosynthesis.
a specific cysteine residue essential for enzymatic activity
has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. the activity
of a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  is inhibited by thiol-alkylating agents
(1). the cysteine residue acts as a nucleophile to attack the
sulfhydryl group of cysteine, resulting in the formation of
an enzyme-bound cysteine persulfide intermediate (14). the
persulfide s is subsequently incorporated into the biosynthetic
pathways of s-containing cofactors such as molybdopterin,
thiamin, biotin, and  xxxd2494xxx , as well as iron-sulfur
clusters in proteins and thionucleosides in e. coli trnas,
including 4-thiouridine and 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiou-

ridine (15, 16). synthesis of 4-thiouridine requires  xxxg1562xxx ,
which mobilizes s via an l-cysteine desulfurase activity, and
thii, a protein with adenylation and sulfur transferase
activities.  xxxg1562xxx  and thii alone suffice to generate 4-thiouridine.  xxxg1562xxx  converts cysteine into alanine and forms a
persulfide group on an active site cysteine residue, and the
s is transferred to thii for further transfer to trna to
generate 4-thiouridine (17-20).
iron-sulfur proteins are ubiquitous in bacteria, archaea,
and eukaryotes. in most iron-sulfur proteins the clusters
function as electron transfer groups, but in others they have
other functions such as contributing to catalytic activity,
maintenance of protein structure, or regulation of activity
(21). iron-sulfur cluster assembly is important for the de
novo synthesis of a broad spectrum of proteins and also the
repair of certain iron-sulfur proteins that are damaged during
oxidative stress. so far, an understanding of the mechanism
for iron-sulfur protein assembly has mainly been gained
from in vitro experiments. formation of the iron-sulfur
cluster is initiated by the abstraction of s from cysteine in a
reaction catalyzed by cysteine desulfurases such as bacterial
 xxxg1562xxx ,  xxxg1562xxx , sufs, or yeast nfs1p (1, 9, 14). the s atom
derived from l-cysteine is transferred directly to a scaffold
protein such as iscu and nifu for the assembly of ironsulfur clusters. several groups have obtained evidence of
complexation and persulfide transfer between  xxxg1562xxx  and iscu
(22-24). the preformed cluster can subsequently be transferred from iscu to an iron-sulfur apoprotein. furthermore,
some experiments showed that  xxxg1562xxx , cysteine, and iron could
be used in vitro to reconstitute iron-sulfur clusters of several
different iron-sulfur proteins, including the nitrogenase apofe protein (25), regulatory proteins apo-fnr (26) and aposoxr (27) from e. coli, and apo-biotin synthase from
bacillus sphaericus (28). a  xxxg1562xxx -like protein from the
cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc 6803 could be used to
produce holoferredoxin from apoferredoxin (29). similar in
vitro experiments have shown that  xxxg1562xxx  is also effective in
iron-sulfur cluster formation. cysteine desulfurase encoded
by the gene  xxxg1562xxx  of e. coli could directly convert the nitric
oxide-modified ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex to the
ferredoxin [2fe-2s] cluster in the presence of l-cysteine in
vitro (30).  xxxg1562xxx  from e. coli could be used to reconstitute
the iron-sulfur cluster of dihydroxy acid dehydratase (3).
 xxxg1562xxx  can also reconstitute the iron-sulfur cluster of 3′phosphoadenosine- xxxd1564xxx -sulfonucleotide reductase (31). although the exact mechanism of s incorporation
into iron-sulfur clusters remains unclear, cysteine desulfurase is proposed to play a general role in the formation
of iron-sulfur clusters.
in a previous study, we reported identification and
characterization of a dnd gene cluster for a novel dna s
modification in streptomyces lividans 66 (32, 33). the entire
gene cluster (dnd) involved in this modification was localized
on an 8 kb dna fragment. a gene cluster (designated dndae) encoding five open reading frames (orfs) was identified
by sequence analysis. dnda was predicted to encode a protein
of 397 amino acids with a molecular mass of 43 kda and
close sequence resemblance to e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  (a cysteine
desulfurase), and dndc was deduced to encode a protein of
498 amino acids with a molecular mass of 57 kda, with
homology to subunit 2 of the sulfate adenylate transferase
in the paps reductase family of proteins. in order to identify

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007 6127
functions for dnda and dndc, and to characterize their
possible interactions, both proteins were expressed in e. coli
and purified to homogeneity. dnda was first characterized
as a homodimeric protein containing pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
as a coenzyme, and confirmed to catalyze the removal of
elemental s atoms from l-cysteine to produce l-alanine, and
was subsequently shown to be able to directly activate apofe dndc for its reconstitution as a fully functional [4fe4s] cluster protein (dndc) with unambiguously demonstrated
atp pyrophosphatase activity.

plasmid pet-15b were purchased from novagen (darmstadt,
germany). enzymes for dna manipulation were purchased
from new england biolabs (beverly, ma), roche molecular
biochemicals (mannheim, germany), or takara shuzo
(kyoto, japan). synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained
from shanghai sangon biological engineering technology
and services (shanghai, china). molecular mass markers for
gel filtration and columns of hitrap chelating and superose
12 (10/30) were purchased from amersham pharmacia
biotech (uppsala, sweden). centricon plus-20 (pl-10)
centrifugal filter devices were from millipore (bedford, ma).
l-cysteine, l-selenocystine, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp),
and ferrous ammonium sulfate [fe(nh4)2(so4)2] were purchased from sigma-aldrich.  xxxd3186xxx  was prepared
from l-selenocystine as previously described (34). the
enzcheck pyrophosphate assay kit was from molecular
probes inc. (eugene, or). coomassie blue protein assay
reagent was from bio-rad. all other reagents were of
analytical grade.
cloning and expression of the dnda gene. the coding
region of the s. lividans dnda protein was amplified by pcr
with phz1904 as a template (phz1904 harboring the whole
dnd gene cluster). the following two oligonucleotide primers
were used: upstream primer, 5′-ggaattccatatgacgtacgggacgtgcag-3′containing an ndei recognition
site (underlined) with the atg start codon; downstream
primer, 5′-cgggatcctcaatagctcggcttcagcttc3′ containing a bamhi recognition site (underlined) with the
tga stop codon. the ndei/bamhi-digested pcr product
was purified and ligated to the expression vector pet15b
(novagen) to yield phz882 containing a six-histidine tag
attached to the n terminus of the dnda polypeptide. plasmid
dna from a positive clone was sequenced and subsequently
introduced by transformation into e. coli bl21(de3) plyse
competent cells. the bacteria were grown in 500 ml of
luria-bertani medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and
25 µg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °c to an a600 of 0.8. the
dnda gene was expressed by induction at 30 °c for 3 h with
0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-beta-d-galactoside (iptg). the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 5 min at
4 °c. cell pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer a
(20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl).
purification of the dnda protein. resuspended bacteria
were subjected to three complete cycles of freeze-thawing
and then disrupted by sonication. the soluble protein from
the cell lysate was collected in the supernatant after
centrifugation at 15000g for 30 min at 4 °c. the crude extract
was applied to a 5 ml hitrap chelating column (amersham

6128 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007
pharmacia biotech) charged with nickel and preequilibrated
with buffer a. the column was subsequently washed
thoroughly with buffer a, and the protein was eluted with a
linear gradient of buffer b (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0,
150 mm nacl, 500 mm imidazole). fractions were analyzed
by sds-page, and those containing his-tagged dnda were
pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml in centricon plus-20
(pl-10) centrifugal filter devices (millipore). the sample
was then applied to a superose 12 10/30 column (amersham
pharmacia biotech) equilibrated with buffer a using an
äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (amersham pharmacia biotech). proteins were eluted with the same
equilibration buffer with a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. fractions
containing dnda protein were pooled. the purity of purified
dnda protein was greater than 95% judging from its
electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing sds
followed by staining with coomassie blue. the protein
concentration was determined with the bradford protein assay
kit (bio-rad) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard. the
final preparation of the enzyme was stored frozen at
-30 °c in the buffer supplemented with 0.02 mm pyridoxal
5′-phosphate until use.
site-directed mutagenesis. the mutants with cysteine
residues mutated to serine were prepared by overlap extension pcr. to construct the c327s mutant, two pcrs, with
phz1904 as the template, were performed with primer pairs
dnda-1 (5′-ggaattccatatgacgtacgggacgtgcag-3′) plus dnda-2 (5′-gcgctggtggacgccgagc3′) and dnda-3 (5′-gctcggcgtccaccagcgc-3′) plus
dnda-4 (5′-cgggatcctcaatagctcggcttcagcttc-3′). these reactions produced 3′ and 5′ fragments of
dnda, respectively, whose sequences overlapped by 19 bp
at the mutation. by combining the two pcr products as
templates and using the dnda n-terminal and c-terminal
primers, the fused coding sequence of the c327s variant was
amplified by pcr. this pcr product was digested with ndei
and bamhi, ligated into expression vector pet15b, and then
sequenced. a clone with the sequence for the desired c327s
mutation was chosen and introduced into e. coli bl21(de3)
plyse. the recombinant cells were used for overproduction
and purification of the c327s mutant enzyme.
preparation of the dndc protein. the coding region of
the s. lividans dndc protein was amplified by pcr with
phz1904 as a template. two primers were designed to
contain an ndei restriction site in one primer and a bamhi
site in the other. the sequences of the primers are as
follows: dndc-l,5′-ggaattccatatgagcacccccaaggc-3′, and dndc-2, 5′-cgggatccttatgcaggtgcatcggtg-3′. the ndei/bamhi-digested pcr product
was purified and ligated to the expression vector prset-b
(invitrogen) to yield pjtu76 containing a six-histidine tag
attached to the c terminus of the dndc polypeptide. pjtu76
was introduced into e. coli bl21(de3) plyse. the recombinant bacteria were used for overproduction and purification
of dndc protein as described above for dnda protein.
gel filtration. the native molecular masses of dnda and
dndc were determined by gel filtration with a superose 12
10/30 column (amersham pharmacia biotech) equilibrated
with 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl buffer using
an äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (fplc).
the column had previously been calibrated with the following gel filtration molecular mass markers (amersham

aldolase amylase (158 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (67 kda),
ovalbumin (43 kda), and  xxxg1963xxx  (13.7 kda).
assay for cysteine desulfurase activity. dnda desulfurase
activity was measured as sulfide production using l-cysteine
and l-cystine as substrate as previously described (35).
reactions were carried out at 37 °c in glass culture tubes
capped with rubber septa stoppers (waters). the assay was
carried out in a 0.8 ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm
tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 0.02 mm plp, and 5 mm dithiothreitol
(dtt) and various concentrations of dnda. the reactions
were initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm l-cysteine (sigma).
after a 20 min incubation at 37 °c, the reaction was stopped
by adding 100 µl of 20 mm n,n-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 n hcl and 100 µl of 30 mm fecl3 in
1.2 n hcl. after further incubation in the dark for 30 min,
the absorption of  xxxd2610xxx  was measured at 650 nm,
and the sulfide concentration was determined on the basis
of a standard na2s curve.
l-cystine,  xxxd519xxx ,  xxxd3186xxx , and
l-selenocystine were tested as substrates in a different way.
cysteine desulfinase was assayed by determination of alanine
formed from the above substrates with alanine dehydrogenase
(4). a standard reaction mixture containing 5 mm lselenocysteine, 5 mm dtt, 0.02 mm plp, 2.5 mm nad+,
120 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 8.0), and enzyme in a final
volume of 0.5 ml was incubated at 37 °c. a molar turbidity
coefficient of nadh at 340 nm, 6.22 × 106 m-1‚cm-1, was
used. specific activity was expressed as units per milligram
of protein, with 1 unit of enzyme defined as the amount that
catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of the product in 1 min.
assay for atp pyrophosphatase activity. atp pyrophosphatase activity was monitored by using the enzcheck
pyrophosphate assay kit (molecular probes). in this assay,
ppi is converted to pi by  xxxg1804xxx . the
substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine  xxxd2246xxx 
(mesg) is converted enzymatically by  xxxd2705xxx 
phosphorylase (pnp) to  xxxd1585xxx  and 2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine. enzymatic conversion of mesg
results in a shift in absorbance maximum from 330 nm for
the substrate to 360 nm for the product. one unit of enzyme
was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the
formation of 1 nmol of the product (ppi)/min. specific
activity was expressed as units per milligram of protein.
in vitro reconstitution of the iron-sulfur center. the
assembly of the iron-sulfur clusters to the apo-fe dndc
protein was performed under anaerobic conditions (nitrogen
atmosphere), as previously described (25). to prepare apofe dndc, purified dndc protein (0.17 µmol) was incubated
with 1 µm r,r′-dipyridyl in the presence of 2 mm dithionite
in a total volume of 0.6 ml at room temperature for 30 min.
apo-fe dndc protein was purified from the reaction mixture
using an fplc sepharose 12 10/30 column equilibrated with
50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl buffer. the
absorption spectrum of this sample was recorded. the sample
was then made anaerobic and placed in a sealed cuvette. apofe dndc (40 nmol) was incubated with 0.3-0.6 nmol of
dnda protein in the presence of 2.5 mm dtt and 2 mm
fe(nh4)2(so4)2 in a total volume of 0.6 ml in 50 mm trishcl, ph 7.4, and 50 mm nacl. the mixture was incubated
at 37 °c for 5 min before 1 mm l-cysteine (sigma) was
added. reconstituted dndc was separated from the reaction

determination of iron, acid-labile sulfide, and uvvisible spectra. the content of iron in dndc protein was
determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in a varian

25 mm hepes buffer as a standard. acid-labile sulfide was
determined by the method of beinert (36). optical spectra
during dndc reconstitution were recorded on a perkin-elmer
lambda 650 two-beam spectrophotometer under anaerobic
conditions using a slit width of 2 nm and 1 cm light path.
the reference cuvette contained the reaction mixture without
dndc protein.
results
evidence that dnda is a functional cysteine desulfurase.
the nucleotide sequence of the dnda gene incorporated into
the expression plasmid (phz882) was confirmed to be
identical to that registered in genbank accession number
aaz29040. induced expression of the gene by addition of
iptg produced ca. 35% of the total soluble cellular protein
as dnda, with a molecular mass of 45 kda as estimated by
sds-page (figure 1, inset), consistent with the size of
the polypeptide deduced from the dnda gene sequence
(44984 da). the purified dnda, using hitrap chelating and
superose 12, was in the n-terminal his-tagged form, and
ca. 15 mg of homogeneous protein could be obtained per
liter of culture in a representative purification (table 1).
the molecular mass of the purified soluble dnda protein
was determined to be 91 kda by gel filtration (figure 1),
implying its presence as a homodimer. the purified dnda
protein had a bright yellow color, with an absorbance
spectrum (figure 2) typical of a protein to which the cofactor

an absorption maximum at 420 nm (figure 2, curve a) at
ph 8.0. reduction by addition of sodium borohydride
(1 mm) to the dnda protein solution resulted in disappearance of the absorption band at 420 nm within 2 min, with a
concomitant increase in absorbance at 330 nm (figure 2,
curve b). these results are fully consistent with the expected
reduction of the imine linkage between the protein and a
 xxxd3047xxx  cofactor (37). the reduced dnda protein
was catalytically inactive, and the addition of plp did not
reverse the inactivation.
purified dnda from s. lividans could catalyze removal
of a substituent at the beta-carbon of  xxxd3186xxx , lcysteine, and l- xxxd519xxx  to yield l-alanine
(table 2). although the specific activity of the enzyme
toward  xxxd3186xxx  (56.5 units/mg) was lower than that
of e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  protein (3100 units/mg) (11), the specific
activity of the enzyme toward l-cysteine (38.6 units/mg) was
comparable to that of e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  (78 units/mg) (3) and a.
vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  (89 units/mg) (1). the optimal ph value for
the removal of selenium from  xxxd3186xxx  was around
ph 8.0 in tris-hcl, in accordance with other cysteine
desulfurases. the substrate specificity of the enzyme is
summarized in table 3. the enzyme showed the lowest km
value and the highest kcat and kcat/km values for l-seleno-

role of cysteine residues of dnda. as a cysteine
desulfurase, whose representative members ( xxxg1562xxx , csda, and
sufs) could be classified into two groups based on the
sequence similarity of a specific motif in the active site that
contains a conserved cysteine (4), dnda falls into a group
(i) with a consensus sequence, atgsacts, around a
conserved cysteine residue (cys327) in the c-terminal region.
the counterpart cysteine 327 of dnda is highly conserved
in many  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins and was shown to be crucial for
the activity of a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  (3). in  xxxg1562xxx , this conserved
cysteine side chain is thought to bind the s mobilized from
 xxxd1788xxx . consequently, we replaced this conserved
residue with serine by site-directed mutagenesis and determined the cysteine desulfurase activity of the substituted
protein. as suspected, the overexpressed and purified serine
mutant protein had no cysteine desulfurase activity, consistent
with the results obtained using similarly substituted versions
of a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  (3) and e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  (14).
dnda promotes iron-sulfur cluster assembly in dndc.
we also examined whether dnda could play a role in ironsulfur cluster assembly, as was shown for e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  and
a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  that facilitate formation of iron-sulfur
proteins in vitro. as revealed by a blast search, dndc in
the dnd gene cluster has a polycysteine cluster implicating
it as a potential iron-sulfur-containing protein. we therefore
overproduced and purified his6-tagged dndc in e. coli. uvvisible absorption spectroscopy of the recombinant dndc,
eluted from the affinity matrix as a brownish protein, showed
a broad absorption band between 350 and 500 nm with a
shoulder around 410 nm (figure 3, curve a), indicating that
dndc is indeed an iron-sulfur-containing protein. to gain
information regarding the atomic composition of the ironsulfur cluster in dndc, the content of iron and acid-labile s
was determined. analysis of freshly prepared dndc indicated
4.2 ( 0.05 mol of iron and 4.6 ( 0.4 mol of sulfide per
mole of dndc (concentration 0.22 mm per assay, three
independent determinations), consistent with the presence of
a single [4fe-4s] cluster per dndc monomer. when apo-fe
dndc was tested, disappearance of its characteristic uvvisible spectrum was observed (figure 3, curve c). when
apo-fe dndc protein was incubated anaerobically in the
presence of l-cysteine, ferrous ammonium sulfate, dtt, and
dnda, uv-visible spectra recorded after reconstitution
showed an increased peak at 410 nm (figure 3, curve b),
while the 410 nm peak was not observed in a control assay
in which heat-inactivated dnda was used instead of dnda.
the in vitro assembled dndc and purified dndc exhibited
essentially identical spectra, demonstrating successful ironsulfur center synthesis by the addition of dnda.

figure 3: absorption spectra of purified dndc (curve a), restored
dndc (curve b) and apo-fe dndc (curve c). the spectra for purified
dndc and apo-fe dndc were taken in 50 mm tris-hcl buffer
(ph 7.4) with 150 mm  xxxd3213xxx  at a protein concentration
of 0.068 mm. the reconstituted dndc (0.064 mm) was recorded
under anaerobic conditions, containing 50 mm tris-hcl (ph7.4)
with 150 mm  xxxd3213xxx  and 1 mm dtt.

figure 4: atp pyrophosphatase activity of dndc and reactivation
of apo-fe dndc by dnda. (a) atp pyrophosphatase activity was
measured with various amounts of purified dndc (b) or apo-fe
dndc (o). (b) atp pyrophosphatase activity of reconstituted
dndc. apo-fe dndc (40 nmol) was incubated together with various
proteins: 0.6 nmol of dnda (9); 0.3 nmol of dnda (2); 5 nmol
of dnda-c327s (0); 5 nmol of heat-inactivated dnda (4).

reconstitution of the atp pyrophosphatase activity of
dndc by dnda. to provide further evidence that s. lividans
dnda facilitates formation of an iron-sulfur cluster, the
specific activity of dndc was examined. because scrutiny
of sequence data revealed that dndc shares a unique “ploop” motif with the ppi synthetase family of proteins, we
tried to determine its hypothetical atp pyrophosphatase
activity. indeed, while the specific activity of the native
dndc protein as an atp pyrophosphatase was 4.7 (
0.2 units/mg of protein, apo-fe protein, prepared by removing
the iron-sulfur cluster using r,r′-dipyridyl chelation,
lost its atp pyrophosphatase activity almost completely
(figure 4a). spectral data confirmed removal of the ironsulfur cluster in apo-fe dndc, correlating its lack of atp
pyrophosphatase activity with the absence of a 4fe-4s
cluster. subsequently, we investigated the possibility of

dnda and dndc in dna s-modification in s. lividans
restoring enzyme activity by reconstituting dndc by adding
recombinant dnda anaerobically to the apo-fe dndc protein,
in the presence of l-cysteine, dtt, and ferrous ammonium
sulfate. interestingly, a rapid increase of atp pyrophosphatase activity was observed (figure 4b) under these
conditions. reconstitution of the inactive apo-fe dndc
catalyzed by dnda resulted in 80% recovery of the original
activity, and restoration of the enzyme activity was found
to depend on the concentration of dnda; a nearly complete
restoration could be obtained after the apo-fe dndc protein
was incubated with 0.6 nmol of dnda at 37 °c for 40 min.
this increase in atp pyrophosphatase activity was not found
when dnda was replaced by heat-inactivated dnda or the
dnda-c327s mutant protein (figure 4b). in addition, in the
absence of ferrous ammonium sulfate or l-cysteine, reconstitution of atp pyrophosphatase activity was not observed.
these results indicated that iron-sulfur centers in dndc are
required for its enzymatic activity and that they can be
efficiently assembled by dnda.
discussion
the proposed biochemical pathway (33) leading to a novel
dna modification by s involves five putative proteins
encoded by the dnd gene cluster. an initial comparison with
the possible mechanism proposed for e. coli trna modification by s to synthesize 4-thiouridine, which needs only two
enzymes ( xxxg1562xxx  and thii), suggested that the mechanism for
dna modification by s was more complex, as all of the
five proteins (dnda-e) seemed to be essential either for
direct s incorporation or regulation of the dna modification
(33, 38); additional catalytic steps were likely to be involved.
 xxxg1562xxx  involved in e. coli trna modification indeed showed
extensive homology with dnda of the five proteins for dna
modification. the similar role of dnda with  xxxg1562xxx  as an
l-cysteine desulfurase, which might be essential for the
mobilization of s into either dna or trna, and the similar
role of dndc with thii, sharing a unique adenylation-specific
p-loop motif (sggkds for dndc and sggfds for thii),
which may function as a sulfate adenylate transferase for
activation of the nucleotides to be modified, clearly suggested
the existence of common steps in the respective biochemical
pathways. the above information, mostly deduced from
bioinformatic analysis, needed to be confirmed or revealed
by biochemical approaches and prompted us to focus on these
two types of enzymes probably shared, at least to certain
extent, by both pathways.
in a first experiment, we showed that s. lividans dnda
was indeed a plp-containing homodimer that specifically
catalyzes formation of l-alanine and elemental s using
l-cysteine as substrate. the fact that the replacement of the
normal cysteine residue (cys327) by a serine in dnda
abolished its cysteine desulfurase activity proved the requirement of this cysteine for catalytic function to bind s
mobilized from  xxxd1788xxx , agreeing with the identical role
of  xxxg1562xxx  for trna modification in e. coli (18). dnda could
thus be established as an  xxxg1562xxx -counterpart protein.
in a second experiment, we also showed that dndc
possesses an obvious atp pyrophosphatase activity, catalyzing hydrolysis of atp to pyrophosphate (ppi), whose
specific activity (4.7 units/mg) was about 2.5 times of that

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007 6131
catalyzed by thii (1.9 units/mg; unpublished data). this
could be a clear indication that activation of the specific site
for modification by adenylation is necessary, resembling the
situation for thii.
in a further experiment, we demonstrated that the function
of dndc could be mediated by formation of an iron-sulfur
cluster protein, whose reconstitution was activated by dnda.
the exact mechanism for [4fe-4s] cluster formation stimulated by dnda is not proven, but a likely relevance to its
ability to mobilize s for iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution
exists. biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters usually needs
scaffolding proteins, like nifu or iscu, or nifu(iscu)-like
proteins, whose direct counterpart was not obviously found
to be encoded by the dnd gene cluster. although five orfs
that are similar to  xxxg1562xxx  were found in the fully sequenced
genome of strerptomyces coelicolor a3(2), a close relative
of s. lividans, only one (sco1920) was found to encode a
nifu-like protein. our data could not prove or exclude
whether this nifu-like counterpart protein in s. lividans
would function as a scaffold protein for the assembly and
delivery of iron-sulfur clusters to dndc protein. an e. coli
csd system contributing to fe-s biogenesis in vivo, which
was known to contain a  xxxg1562xxx -like enzyme and a sulfur
acceptor protein but no scaffold, was previously reported
(39). the failure of the other potential five  xxxg1562xxx  homologues
to complement the dnda mutation in s. lividans for
incorporation of sulfur into its dna and capability of dnda
in catalyzing the activation of dndc in vitro for iron-sulfur
cluster formation suggested that the activation of dndc in
vivo might be indeed dependent on dnda protein. ironsulfur proteins have been reported to play important roles
in many fundamental processes of life, such as functioning
as electron transfer groups, contributing to catalytic or
regulatory activities (21), as sulfur donor to provide sulfur
for insertion into dethiobiotin (40), playing a purely structural
role as in e. coli endonuclease iii (41) and muty (42) like
zn in zn-finger proteins, in which the cluster controls the
structure of a protein loop essential for recognition and repair
of damaged dna (43). the iron-sulfur-containing dndc
protein and its activated formation might be unique and/or
specific to the dna s-modification system. the iron-sulfurcontaining feature, and fact that the natural dndc was active
only in a dimeric form while apo-fe dndc was inactive in
a polymeric form (data not shown), implied that the
functional role of dndc mimics that of thii in its adenylation
activity but not in other possible structural and/or functional
aspects. it was the obvious presence of the shared regional
homology with a unique p-loop motif between two proteins,
which was known to be important in thii for the adenylation
of the uridine for its subsequent modification forming
4-thiouridine in the trna, that prompted us to propose that
the likely formation of a persulfide group between dnda
and dndc and activation of the site to be modified by
adenylation prior to nucleophilic attack by dndc persulfide
for site-specific dna modification. this resembles the
formation of a persulfide group between  xxxg1562xxx  and thii and
activation of the uridine by adenylation prior to nucleophilic
attack by thii persulfide to generate 4-thiouridine in trna
modification. dndc’s additional property as an iron-sulfur
cluster as suggested by the detected spectroscopic difference
indicates that dndc could also function as a sulfur donor
for nucleophilic attack of the site to be modified and that

6132 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007
this is a specific requirement for site-specific modification
of dna, but not rna.
we propose that adenylation of the site to be modified,
and/or the site specificity of the modification into dna, is
dependent on formation of an iron-sulfur cluster for dna
modification, but not for trna modification, as mechanistically five enzymes are needed for the former but only two
enzymes are needed for the latter. thus, the cysteine
desulfurase dnda is also a central switch for dndc to form
as an iron-sulfur cluster protein, which is a prerequisite for
performing its atp pyrophosphatase activity on the site in
dna. the iron-sulfur center of the dndc protein could also
have an important structural role for recruitment of dndd
and dnde at the modification site. these two proteins,
encoded by genes cotranscribed with dndc, are believed to
be involved in subsequent stages of dna s-modification.
the essential roles of these genes in the proposed biochemical pathway for site-specific dna modification are under
study. additionally, we are also making an effort to purify
dndc protein from a dnda mutant to examine its suspected
nonreconstituted activity in order to prove the activating role
of dnda for iron-sulfur cluster formation of dndc.
