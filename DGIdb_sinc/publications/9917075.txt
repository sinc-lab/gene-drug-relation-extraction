 xxxd3395xxx , a selective  xxxg487xxx 
inhibitor for treatment of parkinson’s disease
david r. p. guay, pharm.d., fcp, fccp, fascp
 xxxd3395xxx  is a selective peripheral and central  xxxg487xxx 
(comt) inhibitor recently approved as adjunctive therapy in patients with
idiopathic parkinson’s disease who are already being treated with a levodopaperipheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor (ddi) combination.  xxxd3395xxx 
potentiates and prolongs the effect of levodopa in the central nervous system
(cns) by enhancing levodopa’s delivery to the cns and slowing dopamine’s
central metabolism. a short terminal disposition half-life of 2 hours mandates
dosing 3 times/day. dosage adjustment is generally unnecessary in the
presence of mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment.
coadministration of  xxxd3395xxx  with levodopa-ddi results in significant
amelioration of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena and frequently allows
significant levodopa dosage reduction. in patients with stable disease,
 xxxd3395xxx  improves “on” time. as might be expected from its potentiation of
levodopa effects, dopaminergic side effects are prominent with this agent.
although the main objective of drug treatment in parkinson’s disease remains
clinical improvement with an optimum dose and frequency of levodopa
administration,  xxxd3395xxx  may prove a useful adjunct to such therapy,
especially in the presence of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena. the
relative merits of this agent vis-a-vis dopamine receptor agonists are
somewhat unclear at present. however, recent guidelines from the american
academy of neurology suggest that a comt inhibitor be added to levodopadopamine agonist therapy in patients with advanced disease.

summary

parkinson’s disease is primarily a syndrome of
nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency. gradual
destruction of dopaminergic neurons gives rise to
the well-recognized symptoms of tremors,
hypokinesia, postural instability, and rigidity.
the hoehn and yahr scale is frequently used to
stage the severity of the disease (table 1).
currently available treatments include
anticholinergic agents; amantadine; levodopa

alone or, more commonly, in conjunction with a
peripheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor (ddi)
such as carbidopa or benserazide, the latter not
being available in the united states; selegiline;
and dopamine receptor agonists such as
bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, and
 xxxd3145xxx . despite these treatments, parkinson’s
disease remains a significant cause of morbidity
and mortality in the aging united states
population.
although levodopa-carbidopa and levodopabenserazide are cornerstones of treatment,
problems remain with these agents, such as
incomplete patient response, emergence of motor
fluctuations, and emergence of dyskinesias
during therapy. potential mechanisms include
the following. first, no more than 5–10% of an
oral levodopa dose reaches the brain despite
peripheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibition.
second, peripheral and central concentrations of
the levodopa metabolite 3-o-methyldopa (3omd) are increased, which may be detrimental;
3-omd decreases the efficacy of levodopa in
animals and humans, possibly by reducing
levodopa transport through the blood-brain
barrier, and elevated brain 3-omd
concentrations have been linked to dyskinesias
and the on-off phenomenon. third, central side
effects of levodopa persist and may even be
intensified.1
discovery of the enzyme catechol-omethyltransferase (comt) in the 1950s and the
resulting explosion in research activity
surrounding this enzyme2, 3 led, in the late 1980s,
to rekindled interest in comt inhibition as an
adjunct to other therapies of parkinson’s disease.
in mammals, comt is extensively distributed
throughout the body, with highest activity in liver
and kidneys. in vertebrates, comt is
predominantly a cellular enzyme and appears

7

mostly in a soluble form ( xxxg487xxx ), with a
minor fraction in a membrane-bound form (mbcomt). the single gene encoding for  xxxg487xxx 
and  xxxg487xxx  is localized to chromosome 22 in
humans. human  xxxg487xxx  and  xxxg487xxx 
contain 222 and 271 amino acids, respectively,
with corresponding molecular weights of 24.4
and 30.0 kd.
comt catalyses the transfer of a methyl group
from s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam) to one of
the hydroxy groups of a catechol substrate in the
presence of magnesium (figure 1).4 physiologic
substrates of comt include levodopa,
catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites,
catechol estrogens, and  xxxd228xxx . numerous
dietary and pharmacologic products are also
good substrates (e.g., triphenols and substituted
catechols, dobutamine,  xxxd2401xxx , rimiterol,
a-methyldopa, benserazide, carbidopa).
generally, comt functions to eliminate
biologically active or toxic catechols and their
hydroxylated metabolites.
the course of the methylation reaction
proceeds through a direct nucleophilic attack by
one of the hydroxyl groups of the catechol
substrate on the methyl carbon of sam in a tight
sn2-like transition state by a sequence-ordered

figure 1. conversion of levodopa to 3-o-methyldopa by
the transmethylating enzyme  xxxg487xxx 
(comt). transmethylation by comt requires mg2+ and sadenosyl-  xxxd2595xxx  (sam) as the methyl donor and
results in generation of  xxxd3157xxx  (sah).

mechanism. sam is the first substrate to bind,
and  xxxd3157xxx  (sah) is the last
product to dissociate from the enzyme.
 xxxd2531xxx  bind to the free enzyme in a
rapid equilibrium reaction.
the kinetic mechanism of  xxxg487xxx  and mbcomt is the same based on calcium inhibition,
magnesium requirement, optimum ph, similar
(k m ) for sam, and recognition by  xxxg487xxx 
antiserum. these are, however, different
enzymes and  xxxg487xxx  is not a precursor of scomt.  xxxg487xxx  has a high km for dopamine
and a very high capacity (vmax 50 pmol/min/mg
protein in skeletal muscle to 14,690
pmol/min/mg protein in the liver), whereas mbcomt has a much lower km and a low capacity
(2–40 pmol/min/mg protein).  xxxg487xxx 
probably still plays an important role in
dopamine metabolism at the normal physiologic
concentrations seen in the central nervous
system (cns).
interest in comt inhibitors generally
surrounds their use as adjuncts to levodopa
therapy of parkinson’s disease based on the
importance of comt in the complex metabolism
of levodopa (figure 2). 5 theoretically, these
agents should reduce the formation of 3-omd
from levodopa, thereby improving the
bioavailability of levodopa, increasing its entry
into the cns, and possibly prolonging its
terminal disposition half-life. a peripherally
acting comt inhibitor would be a logical means
of attaining these effects. a comt inhibitor that
can enter the cns might further potentiate the

effect of levodopa by slowing the metabolism of
brain dopamine. other areas of interest involve
the potential for comt inhibitors to potentiateprolong the action of other catechol-structured
compounds (bronchodilators, e.g., epinephrine,
 xxxd2401xxx , rimiterol; dopamine agonists, e.g.,
dobutamine, fenoldepam; a-methyldopa;
 xxxd2689xxx ) as well as potentiate endogenous
norepinephrine in the treatment of orthostatic
hypotension and depression.1
inhibitors of comt have been investigated as
adjuncts to levodopa therapy of parkinson’s
disease for over 20 years. older compounds such
as tropolone, u-0521, 3′,4′-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone,  xxxd228xxx , and the gallates
are disappointing due to low in vivo efficacy,
short duration of action, nonselectivity, and frank
toxicity.3
second-generation comt inhibitors such as
cgp 28014,  xxxd2000xxx , nitecapone, and
 xxxd3395xxx  are very potent, highly selective, and
orally active. with the exception of cgp 28014,
nitrocatechol is the key moiety in their chemical
structures (figure 3).6 the first comt inhibitor
to be approved in the united states for adjunctive
management of parkinson’s disease is  xxxd3395xxx 
(tasmar; roche laboratories, nutley, nj).

 xxxd3395xxx  functions as a selective peripheral
and central comt inhibitor, exerting no effect
on adrenergic, serotonergic, or cholinergic
receptors or other enzymes involved in synthesis
or catabolism of catecholamines.8 an oral dose
of 30 mg/kg significantly inhibited rat liver
comt activity for more than 8 hours8 and rat
erythrocyte comt activity by over 90% at 4
hours, 60% at 8 hours, and 30% at 16 hours after
dosing.4  xxxd3395xxx  also inhibited rat duodenal
comt activity.8 in in vitro rat liver homogenate
and ex vivo rat liver experiments, ro 47-1868 (a
hydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd3395xxx ) and ro
47-1669 (an acid metabolite of  xxxd3395xxx ), both
of which are found only in trace amounts in
human plasma after usual therapeutic doses of
 xxxd3395xxx , were nearly equipotent as comt
inhibitors as the parent compound. the 3-o-

 xxxd3395xxx  in parkinson’s disease guay
methyl metabolite of  xxxd3395xxx  was inactive as a
comt inhibitor in these models.4
in rat liver, kidney, and jejunal mucosal
homogenates,  xxxd3395xxx  acted as a concentrationdependent comt inhibitor consistent with a
noncompetitive inhibition mechanism, with renal

comt being 4-fold more sensitive to inhibition
than liver comt. 9 however, other studies
suggested that the drug is such a tight-binding
enzyme inhibitor that classic kinetic analysis is
inappropriate.10
aging in rats is associated with reduced liver
and kidney comt affinity for substrate
(manifested by increased k m ) and reduced
sensitivity toward inhibition by  xxxd3395xxx , with
kidney comt being more sensitive to inhibition
than liver comt, regardless of age.11
most pharmacodynamic studies of  xxxd3395xxx 
used various rat models, including microdialysis
(to determine brain extracellular fluid catecholamine
concentrations) and whole brain homogenate
methodologies. in the basal state, the agent
increases levodopa and  xxxd2471xxx 
(dopac) central concentrations5, 12–15 and reduces
homovanillic acid (hva) and 3-methoxytyramine
(3-mt) central concentrations.5, 8, 12–15 in contrast,
basal central concentrations of dopamine are not
altered.5, 8, 14, 15 after levodopa administration,
 xxxd3395xxx  potentiates increases in levodopa,
dopamine, and dopac central concentrations5, 12,
15–18
and levodopa area under the plasma
concentration versus time curve (auc)8,17; and
reductions in 3-omd formation in brain and
plasma,12, 17, 18 hva central concentrations,5, 12, 13,
18
and 3-mt central concentrations.12
one hypothesis of the pathogenesis of
parkinson’s disease involves transmethylation
reactions of the 1-carbon cycle, reducing brain
catecholamine (including dopamine) concentrations.19 interest has thus been focused on the
effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on rat brain concentrations of
sam and sah.  xxxd3395xxx  inhibits methionine
adenosyltransferase activity, inhibiting transfer of
a methyl group from sam to dopamine, a
reaction that results in inactivation of dopamine.
this is manifested by increased brain sam
concentrations and reduced brain sah
concentrations, increasing the transmethylation
ratio (sam:sah).4, 19
similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
effects were noted in limited studies conducted in
monkeys.  xxxd3395xxx  enhanced the peak plasma
concentration (cmax) and auc of levodopa and
reduced plasma 3-omd concentrations after
exogenous levodopa administration.20, 21 it also
reduced striatal dopamine turnover and the
levodopa loss rate constant in the striatum.21, 22
a number of whole animal models illustrated
the potentiation of levodopa’s central activity by
 xxxd3395xxx . the drug potentiates the effect of
levodopa-benserazide on locomotor activity,

catalepsy in rats and mice.14 it also enhances
locomotor hyperactivity induced by amphetamine
and  xxxd2746xxx  and stereotypy induced by
amphetamine, and stimulates exploratory activity
in the open field test in rats and mice. 14
 xxxd3395xxx  potentiates levodopa antagonism of
haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mpp+-lesioned
mice (murine model of parkinson’s disease) and
potentiates and prolongs levodopa-induced
circling behavior in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal pathway lesions
(another animal model of parkinson’s disease).23, 24
it exerts no significant effect on total body or systemic and pulmonary clearance of norepinephrine,
epinephrine, or dopamine in rabbits.25
two studies examined the drug’s effect on
measures of cognition in rats.  xxxd3395xxx  either
slightly improved (healthy adults and poorly
performing healthy elders) or impaired (nucleus
basalis-lesioned rats) memory tasks.26 in a rat
model of cerebral cortical deafferentation
(ethylcholine aziridinium-induced cholinotoxic
lesions of nucleus basalis), defective memory and
learning were partly prevented by prophylactic
 xxxd3395xxx .27 the relevance of these findings to
the management of parkinsonian dementia in
humans is unknown.
depression occurs in 40–50% of patients with
parkinson’s disease.28 the effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on
animal models of depression was evaluated in
two studies. in rats with chronic mild stressinduced anhedonia,  xxxd3395xxx  10 or 30 mg/kg
twice/day by intraperitoneal injection prevented
the stress-induced anhedonic state compared
with vehicle-treated controls.28 another rat study
using the forced swimming test and learned
helplessness paradigm, found no significant
antidepressant activity of the agent. 29 the
relevance of these findings to the management of
depression in humans with both parkinsonian
and nonparkinsonian disease is unknown.
pharmacokinetics
 xxxd3395xxx 
 xxxd3395xxx  plasma concentration can be
determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography. 30 in vitro metabolic data
derived from rat, dog, rabbit, and human
hepatocyte studies in conjunction with allometric
scaling from in vivo rat, dog, and rabbit
pharmacokinetic studies and time transformations predict the human pharmacokinetics of

 xxxd3395xxx  well in terms of metabolic clearance,
total body clearance, half-life, volume of
distribution (vd), and form the basis for dosages
evaluated in phase ii and iii clinical trials.31
according to data on file with the manufacturer, the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd3395xxx 
is approximately 65%, and food does not alter its
bioavailability significantly.7 the drug is highly
plasma protein bound to albumin (> 99%) over
the relevant plasma concentration range. steadystate volume of distribution is small (9 l).
single-dose pharmacokinetic studies in healthy
young volunteers revealed both roughly doseproportional32 and nonproportional33 increases in
 xxxd3395xxx  cmax over a range of doses from 5–800
mg. time to cmax (tmax) is approximately 1 hour
and is dose independent. 32–34 half-life is
approximately 2 hours,33, 34 although one study
reported it to be dose dependent, ranging from
1.7–3.3 hours over a dose range of 5–800 mg.32
the auc rises in both dose proportional33 as well
as nondose-proportional fashion32 over this same
dosing range.
the agent’s multiple-dose pharmacokinetics
were evaluated in a double-blind, placebocontrolled, ascending-dose study in 36 healthy
young volunteers. regimens were  xxxd3395xxx  100,
200, 400, and 800 mg 3 times/day coadministered
with levodopa 100 mg-carbidopa 25 mg 3
times/day, both agents administered for 7 days.
 xxxd3395xxx  pharmacokinetics were assessed on
days 1 and 7. the increase in  xxxd3395xxx  cmax
with dose was slightly nonlinear on day 1,
whereas the auc rose in a linear, doseproportional fashion. the half-life increased with
increasing dose, but only with 400- and 800-mg
regimens. based on trough  xxxd3395xxx  plasma
concentration versus time data, drug did not
accumulate with 100- and 200-mg regimens, but
tended to occur with 400 mg, and definitely
occurred with 800 mg. study days 1 and 7
pharmacokinetic data differed significantly only
with 800 mg. a minor metabolite of  xxxd3395xxx ,
3-o-methyltolcapone, had a half-life of 30–40
hours, and plasma metabolite concentrations
plateaued by study day 5. the metabolite cmax
and auc increased in a dose-dependent
fashion. 35 other studies found that 3-omethyltolcapone has markedly nonlinear
pharmacokinetics and that its formation is
delayed as the  xxxd3395xxx  dose is increased.33, 34
 xxxd3395xxx  is primarily eliminated by hepatic
metabolism, mainly by conjugation reactions
(glucuronidation, sulfation, acetylation,
methylation) in animals and humans. 31 it is

 xxxd3395xxx  in parkinson’s disease guay
classified as a low-extraction ratio compound.31
in rat liver microsomes, glucuronidation follows
michaelis-menten kinetics. 36 of interest, the
kinetic profile of 3-o-methyltolcapone is affected
by the route of administration in rats, probably
due to differences in affinities of  xxxg487xxx  and
 xxxg487xxx  for  xxxd3395xxx . rat intestinal wall
contains a large amount of  xxxg487xxx , and mbcomt has 10-fold the affinity for  xxxd3395xxx 
compared with  xxxg487xxx .37 the existence and
relevance of this phenomenon in humans is
unknown.
few pharmacokinetic studies have been
conducted outside of healthy young volunteers.
an ascending-dose, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multiple-dose study was conducted in
48 healthy elderly volunteers.38 regimens were
 xxxd3395xxx  100, 200, 400, and 800 mg 3 times/day
for 7 days. time to cmax ranged from 1–2 hours,
and auc rose in a dose-proportional fashion.
increases in c max were less than dose
proportional with 400 and 800 mg.  xxxd3395xxx 
half-life ranged from 2–3 hours and rose from
study days 2–7. drug accumulation (based on
trough plasma concentration vs time data)
occurred only with 400 and 800 mg. the 3-omethyltolcapone half-life was approximately 39
hours. it does not appear that age alone exerts a
significant effect on  xxxd3395xxx  pharmacokinetics.
moderate noncirrhotic hepatic impairment has
no significant effect on  xxxd3395xxx  pharmacokinetics
but moderate cirrhotic hepatic impairment
(child-pugh class b) is associated with 50%
reductions in clearance and v d of unbound
drug.7, 39 population pharmacokinetic studies on
file with the manufacturer, conducted with data
from more than 400 patients enrolled in clinical
trials (creatinine clearance 30–130 ml/min),
suggest that renal impairment has no significant
effect, at least when creatinine clearance exceeds
25 ml/minute.7
levodopa and metabolites
numerous studies evaluated the effect of
 xxxd3395xxx  on plasma compartment pharmacokinetics of levodopa and its 3-omd metabolite.32,
34, 35, 38, 40–45

in a single-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, crossover study in 48 healthy
volunteers, the effect of single oral doses of
 xxxd3395xxx  5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800
mg on plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa and
its metabolites was evaluated after a single oral
dose of levodopa 100 mg-carbidopa 25 mg.

11

 xxxd3395xxx ’s maximum effect on levodopa auc
and half-life (both ~ 2-fold increases) occurred
with the 200-mg dose. no significant effect was
noted on levodopa cmax. plasma concentrations
of 3-omd fell progressively with increasing
 xxxd3395xxx  doses (in terms of c max and auc),
with 64%, 64%, 66%, and 76% reductions with
100, 200, 400, and 800 mg. plasma hva fell and
dopac rose due to peripheral inhibition of
comt.32
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascendingdose, multiple-dose study in 36 healthy
volunteers evaluated the effect of 7 days of 3
times/day oral dosing of  xxxd3395xxx  100, 200, 400
and 800 mg on the plasma pharmacokinetics of
levodopa and 3-omd after 7 days of 3 times/day
oral dosing of levodopa 100 mg-carbidopa 25
mg. 35  xxxd3395xxx  had no significant effect on
levodopa cmax or tmax. levodopa auc rose 1.5to 1.8-fold during  xxxd3395xxx  coadministration
and this effect was not dependent on  xxxd3395xxx 
dose. levodopa half-life rose approximately 2fold, and 3-omd cmax and auc fell dramatically
in a  xxxd3395xxx  dose-dependent fashion.
a single-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, ascending-dose study in
48 healthy elderly volunteers assessed the effect
of oral  xxxd3395xxx  100, 200, 400, and 800 mg 3
times/day on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa
and 3-omd after single oral doses of levodopa
100 mg-benserazide 25 mg. 38  xxxd3395xxx 
coadministration resulted in a slight increase in
levodopa cmax but no effect on tmax. levodopa
auc increased 1.6- to 2.5-fold, and half-life rose
up to 1.8-fold. differences in levodopa
pharmacokinetics among  xxxd3395xxx  doses were
very small. marked dose-dependent reductions
in 3-omd cmax and auc were noted. virtually
no 3-omd was detected after  xxxd3395xxx  800 mg.
the half-life of 3-omd was approximately 17
hours and was independent of  xxxd3395xxx  dose.
a single-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, crossover, ascending-dose study in 48
healthy volunteers determined the effect of single
oral doses of  xxxd3395xxx  10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400,
and 800 mg on plasma pharmacokinetics of
levodopa after single-dose oral administration of
levodopa 100 mg-benserazide 25 mg.34 the 2fold elevation in levodopa auc and half-life
plateaued with  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg. levodopa
t max was significantly increased only with
 xxxd3395xxx  800 mg. marked dose-dependent
reductions in 3-omd c max and auc and
increases in t max occurred after  xxxd3395xxx 
administration.

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 1, 1999

the effect of oral  xxxd3395xxx  on plasma
pharmacokinetics of levodopa was evaluated after
single-dose oral administration of levodopabenserazide 50-12.5, 100-25, 200-50 (regularrelease), and 100-25 mg controlled-release
preparation.40 in this randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 16 healthy
volunteers,  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg or placebo was
administered 1 hour before and 3 and 7 hours
after levodopa-benserazide administration. with
the regular-release formulation, approximately 2fold increases in levodopa half-life and auc
occurred during  xxxd3395xxx  coadministration, but
no consistent effect on cmax and tmax was noted.
with the controlled-release preparation, levodopa
auc increased approximately 2-fold and tmax
was slightly but not statistically significantly
delayed. formation of 3-omd fell by approximately 90% with  xxxd3395xxx  coadministration.
ten stable patients with parkinson’s disease
who were taking oral levodopa-carbidopa plus
selegiline, were in hoehn and yahr stage 2.7 ±
0.1 (mean ± sem), and had wearing-off
phenomenon and peak dose dyskinesias,
participated in a placebo-controlled, crossover
study of the effect of single-dose oral  xxxd3395xxx 
50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg on levodopa
pharmacokinetics. 41 after  xxxd3395xxx  400 mg,
levodopa auc increased significantly (1.7-fold)
and tmax (1.8-fold), and after  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg,
t max increased significantly (2.6-fold). in
another study conducted in 10 patients whose
parkinson’s disease was stabilized with levodopacarbidopa, a single 400-mg oral dose  xxxd3395xxx 
resulted in significant increases in levodopa halflife (mean 63 to 83 min) and auc (mean 787 to
1206 nmol/ml•min) and reduction in total body
clearance (mean 0.61 to 0.38 l/hr/kg), but no
effect was noted on levodopa cmax or tmax.42
patients with stabilized parkinson’s disease
receiving oral levodopa-carbidopa, had 8 weeks
of several oral dosages of  xxxd3395xxx  titrated up to
200 mg 3 times/day.43 significant increases in
plasma levodopa half-life (mean 1.37 to 2.43 hrs)
and auc (mean 13.6 to 17.9 µm x hr) were
recorded after administration of a single dose of
levodopa-carbidopa 100 mg. in 10 patients with
parkinson’s disease stabilized with oral levodopa
100 or 150 mg/dose-benserazide, single oral
doses of  xxxd3395xxx  200 and 400 mg resulted in
significant increases in levodopa half-life by 78
and 64%, respectively, and auc by 58 and 81%,
respectively, with no significant change in
levodopa cmax or tmax.44
finally, 12 patients with parkinson’s disease, 8

of whom had the on-off phenomenon and all of
whom were stable with oral levodopa,
participated in a study of the effect of multipledose oral  xxxd3395xxx  on levodopa and 3-omd
plasma pharmacokinetics.45 the starting dosage
of  xxxd3395xxx  was 50 mg 3 times/day for 2 weeks,
escalated to 100 mg 3 times/day for 2 weeks and
then to 200 mg 3 times/day for 4 weeks
depending on clinical response (see clinical
studies). overall, mean levodopa auc was
increased 34%, mean levodopa half-life was
increased 81%, mean 3-omd auc was decreased
79%, and mean 3-omd c max fell 80% during
 xxxd3395xxx  coadministration. no significant
alterations were noted in levodopa cmax or tmax
or 3-omd tmax.
pharmacodynamics
erythrocytes may be used as a rapid screening
tool for comt inhibitors wherein  xxxg487xxx  and
 xxxg487xxx  activities may be measured
separately.46 in healthy young volunteers, time to
peak red blood cell comt inhibition was
approximately 1–2 hours after  xxxd3395xxx 
administration.33, 34 peak inhibition was 80%
with a 200-mg dose and 90% with an 800-mg
dose.33, 34 degree of inhibition increased with
increasing dose but did not rise in a doseproportional fashion.33, 34 median time for red
blood cell comt activity to return to baseline
ranged from 16–24 hours after single doses of
200–800 mg.33, 34
inhibition of comt by  xxxd3395xxx  follows an
inhibitory emax model, and the active metabolites
ro 47-1868 and ro 47-1669 contribute little or
nothing to inhibition, as these moieties are
present in only trace amounts in human plasma
after therapeutic doses of  xxxd3395xxx . plasma
 xxxd3395xxx  concentrations producing 50% of
maximum attainable inhibition of red blood cell
comt (ec50) range from 0.6–2.133 and 0.5–1.3
mg/l34 in healthy volunteers.
in a multiple-dose study in healthy elderly
volunteers receiving oral  xxxd3395xxx  100, 200,
400, and 800 mg 3 times/day for 7 days, tmax of
red blood cell comt inhibition was dose
independent and ranged from 1.5–3.2 hours.35
degree of comt inhibition increased with
increasing  xxxd3395xxx  dosage. peak inhibition
with 200 mg 3 times/day was approximately 80%.
area under the effect curve (auec) was dose
dependent as well. the ec50 ranged from 0.6–1
mg/l on study day 1 and 0.5–0.8 mg/l on study
day 7.

 xxxd3395xxx  in parkinson’s disease guay
in healthy elderly volunteers taking oral
 xxxd3395xxx  100, 200, 400, and 800 mg 3 times/day
for 7 days, t max for red blood cell comt
inhibition ranged from 1–2 hours in most
subjects. 38 degree of inhibition rose with
increasing  xxxd3395xxx  dosage, and was greater
than 90% inhibition with 400 and 800 mg.
morning trough comt inhibition was clearly
dose dependent. time to recovery of comt
activity was dose dependent as well, with mean
recovery times of 16, 21, 30, and 48 hours after
discontinuation of 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg,
respectively. the ec50 ranged from 0.2–2 mg/l
(mean 0.8 mg/l).
in a study in healthy young volunteers given
three oral doses of  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg over 8
hours, 75% inhibition of red blood cell comt
was observed over 13 hours after administration
of the last  xxxd3395xxx  dose.40 inhibition was not
affected by concurrent administration of
levodopa-benserazide.
the correlation of plasma levodopa and 3omd concentrations and csf 3-omd and hva
concentrations with clinical severity was
evaluated in six patients with parkinson’s disease
receiving levodopa-carbidopa alone or with
 xxxd3395xxx  150–600 mg/day for 8 weeks.43 mean
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) concentrations of
levodopa, dopamine, dopac, and hva rose from
189 to 356, 169 to 325, 5.7 to 7.7, and 190 to
335 nm, respectively, with concurrent
administration of  xxxd3395xxx , and mean csf 3omd concentration fell from 2479 to 502 nm
(csf was collected 2 hrs after levodopa 100 mg).
clinical effects correlated with the fall in csf 3omd concentrations but not with the rise in csf
dopamine or levodopa concentrations.
in healthy volunteers, no simple correlation
was found between  xxxd3395xxx  pharmacokinetics
and red blood cell comt inhibition. however,
the 3-omd auc ratio and maximum degree of
comt inhibition were significantly correlated (r2
> 0.6).34
the effects of  xxxd3395xxx  on cognition in
advanced parkinson’s disease were evaluated in
an open-label, noncontrolled trial. 47 study
participants were eight patients with a mean ± sd
duration of disease of 12.3 ± 7.3 years, all of
whom had the wearing-off phenomenon and
some of whom had the on-off phenomenon. all
patients were receiving levodopa-ddi plus
selegiline at baseline. neuropsychiatric and
motor assessments were conducted at baseline
and 6 months after starting  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg 3
times/day, with dosage reductions of levodopa as

13

allowed by clinical response. both evaluations
were performed in the “on” phase. significant
improvements occurred in attentional task,
auditory verbal short-term memory, cued recall,
visuospatial recall, and constructional apraxia
tests and motor symptoms during  xxxd3395xxx 
therapy. although encouraging, results of this
trial must be replicated in placebo-controlled,
double-blind studies.
clinical studies
several studies were conducted with  xxxd3395xxx ,
usually as add-on or adjunctive therapy for
parkinson’s disease in either patients with stable
disease receiving levodopa or in those with motor
fluctuations during long-term levodopa therapy.
patients were generally evaluated for response by
examination by blinded examiners (investigator’s
global assessments) and by review of selfcompleted diaries documenting “on” and “off”
times. severity of disease and quality of life were
usually evaluated with the unified parkinson’s
disease rating scale.48
results of clinical studies of  xxxd3395xxx  in
parkinson’s disease are shown in table 2.41–45, 49–56
 xxxd3395xxx  coadministration with levodopa-ddi
resulted in substantial potentiation of levodopa
effects and amelioration of the wearing-off and
on-off phenomena. selected studies found
beneficial effects on quality of life.  xxxd3395xxx 
allowed significant levodopa dosage reductions as
well. as would be expected from its potentiation
of levodopa effects, dopaminergic side effects
were prominent with  xxxd3395xxx  coadministration.
adverse events
table 3 shows the frequency of treatmentemergent adverse events in all double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials on file with the
manufacturer. 7 in these trials, approximately
16% of  xxxd3395xxx  recipients discontinued
treatment due to adverse events, compared with
10% of placebo recipients. diarrhea was the
most frequent adverse event resulting in
premature discontinuation (6%  xxxd3395xxx , 1%
placebo).7 the importance of orthostasis, and
patient education regarding measures to reduce
the risk, should not be underestimated in a
primarily geriatric patient population prone to
balance instability and bone fractures.
most adverse events are dopaminergic and to
be expected when  xxxd3395xxx  is taken to
potentiate levodopa-ddi therapy. frequently,
they can be ameliorated by reducing the

treatment, followed by every 6 weeks for the
second 3 months.7 enzyme elevations usually
occur within the first 1.5–6 months of therapy
and in about 50% of patients values return to
baseline within a further 1–3 months despite
continuation of  xxxd3395xxx . on discontinuation
of therapy, enzymes generally decline within 2–3
months.7
a study of the effect of intravenous  xxxd3395xxx 
on norepinephrine concentrations in rabbits
revealed significant drug-associated elevations in
plasma norepinephrine concentrations and
evidence of adrenergic stimulation (arrhythmias).57
the relevance of this finding to humans with
hypertension, arrhythmias, and cardiac disease is
unclear.

 xxxd3395xxx  dosage upward. dyskinesias, however,
may not respond to levodopa-ddi dosage

diarrhea is a somewhat unexpected adverse
event. although generally mild or moderate,
severe diarrhea was reported in 3–4% of
 xxxd3395xxx  recipients. typically, it occurs 6–12
weeks after starting therapy and resolves quickly
after drug discontinuation.7
the prevalence of hepatic enzyme abnormalities
(defined as increases in transaminases to more
than 3-fold above the upper limit of normal) is
1% in patients receiving  xxxd3395xxx  300 mg/day
and 3% in those receiving 600 mg/day. it is
therefore recommended that liver enzymes be

drug interactions
apomorphine is a dopamine receptor agonist
administered to patients with parkinson’s disease
in countries outside the united states. a study
conducted in rats evaluated the effect of
 xxxd3395xxx  on its disposition since comt is
important in its metabolism. in both plasma and
striatum,  xxxd3395xxx  produced no significant
changes in apomorphine cmax or tmax, but did
significantly prolong plasma and striatal halflives from 30 to 65 and 27 to 50 minutes,
respectively, and aucs from 16,095 to 21,100
and 188,672 to 210,213 mg/ml or g/kg/minute,
respectively. thus, apomorphine bioavailability
is enhanced in both plasma and brain by
 xxxd3395xxx , probably by suppression of its hepatic
metabolism.58
the combination of  xxxd3395xxx  and a nonselective
monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitor (phenelzine,

18

pharmacotherapy volume 19, number 1, 1999

tranylcypromine) could theoretically inhibit the
majority of pathways responsible for normal
catecholamine metabolism. it may thus be
prudent to avoid concomitant administration.
 xxxd3395xxx  and the selective mao-b inhibitor
selegiline, as well as ephedrine, can be administered concurrently with safety.7
in vitro protein-binding studies with warfarin,
phenytoin,  xxxd3394xxx , and digoxin revealed no
protein-binding displacement potential with
 xxxd3395xxx .7 although no formal studies have been
performed, it may be expected that  xxxd3395xxx  may
impair the metabolism of other drugs metabolized
by comt (a-methyldopa, dobutamine,
 xxxd2401xxx ), and dosage reduction of these
agents should be considered if concurrent
therapy is contemplated.7 in vitro experiments
with  xxxd3395xxx  reported no significant
interactions with substrates for cytochrome p450
isozymes  xxxd577xxx  (warfarin), 1a2 (caffeine), 3a4
(midazolam, terfenadine, cyclosporine), 2c19 (smephenytoin), and 2d6 (desipramine).7 in vivo
human drug interaction studies revealed no
significant effect of  xxxd3395xxx  on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine and  xxxd3394xxx , the
latter being a substrate for the 2c9 isozyme.7
 xxxd3395xxx  is classified in pregnancy category c
and does pass into breast milk (rat studies).7 no
pediatric data are available with this compound.
dosing and administration
 xxxd3395xxx  is supplied as 100- and 200-mg filmcoated tablets. 7 beginning therapy with a
regimen of 100 mg 3 times/day and then
escalating to a maximum dosage of 200 mg 3
times/day may facilitate patient acceptance by
reducing the potential severity of dopaminergic
adverse events and allowing for a timely
downward adjustment in the concomitant
levodopa-carbidopa dosage, if necessary. 7
patients with moderate to severe (child-pugh
classes b and c) hepatic cirrhosis should not be
escalated to 200 mg 3 times/day.7 no dosage
adjustment is necessary provided that creatinine
clearance exceeds 25 ml/minute. efficacy and
tolerability data are not available for patients
with creatinine clearance below 25 ml/minute,
including those receiving dialysis.7
average wholesale price for  xxxd3395xxx  is $162
for ninety 100-mg tablets and $174 for ninety
200-mg tablets.
formulary considerations
although a cure for parkinson’s disease is not

on the horizon, recent developments in therapies
for the disease bring hope to patients. new
dopamine subtype selective agonists such as
pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx , and cabergoline
(investigational) may potentially allow a delay in
the need to start levodopa and reduce the
frequency of dyskinesias or ergot-based side
effects. these agents thus may play a role as both
first-line and adjunctive therapy.  xxxd3395xxx  and
other comt inhibitors provide a means of
managing motor fluctuations in patients with
late-stage disease as an adjunct to levodopa-ddi.
the use of comt inhibitors in other
dopaminergic regimens is the subject of
continuing studies. direct comparative studies of
dopamine receptor agonists and comt
inhibitors are virtually nonexistent, thus making
it difficult to assess their relative benefits and
risks. furthermore, long-term studies are
necessary to define the ultimate role of these
agents in the management of parkinson’s disease.
in spite of these limitations,  xxxd3395xxx  appears to
be worthy of inclusion on the institutional
formulary, especially for the management of the
motor fluctuations consistent with late-stage
disease. of interest, recent guidelines from the
american academy of neurology suggest that a
comt inhibitor be added to combination
levodopa-dopamine agonist therapy in patients
with advanced disease.59
summary
 xxxd3395xxx  is a selective peripheral and central
comt inhibitor approved as adjunctive therapy
in patients with idiopathic parkinson’s disease
who are already being treated with a levodopaddi combination. the drug potentiates and
prolongs the effect of levodopa in the cns by
enhancing levodopa’s delivery to the cns and
slowing dopamine’s central metabolism. because
of its short terminal disposition half-life of 2
hours, dosing 3 times/day is necessary. dosage
adjustment is generally not required in patients
with mild to moderate renal and hepatic
impairment.
coadministration of  xxxd3395xxx  with levodopaddi results in significant amelioration of
wearing-off and on-off phenomena and
frequently allows significant levodopa dosage
reduction. in patients with stable disease,
 xxxd3395xxx  improves “on” time. with its
potentiation of levodopa effects, dopaminergic
side effects are prominent with this agent.
although the main objective of drug treatment in

 xxxd3395xxx  in parkinson’s disease guay
parkinson’s disease remains clinical improvement
with the optimum dose and frequency of
levodopa administration,  xxxd3395xxx  may be a
useful adjunct to such therapy, especially in
patients with wearing-off and on-off phenomena.
the relative merits of this agent vis-a-vis
dopamine receptor agonists are somewhat
unclear at present.
addendum
since this manuscript was accepted for
publication, the manufacturer of  xxxd3395xxx  has
altered its prescribing information in the
following way:
 xxxd3395xxx  should be reserved for use only in
patients with severe movement abnormalities
who do not respond to or are not appropriate
candidates for other available treatments.
liver function monitoring should be performed
every 2 weeks in  xxxd3395xxx  recipients. it is also
recommended that patients self-monitor for
classic signs of liver disease.
if a patient fails to demonstrate substantial
clinical benefit within the initial 3 weeks of
therapy, he or she should be withdrawn from the
drug.
new labeling includes an informed consent
document that clinicians are advised to use when
prescribing  xxxd3395xxx  to facilitate full disclosure
of the risk:benefit profile of the product.
patients are advised not to abruptly discontinue
the drug on their own, as this can lead to a return
of symptoms or other severe complications.
