abstract
recent experimental and clinical studies report beneficial metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs interfering with angiotensin. antagonists at
the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  can reduce blood glucose and triglyceride levels. so far, there is little evidence, however, that angiotensin  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists can also affect food intake. particularly unknown is if drugs of this class can have acute effects on short term feeding. to address this issue,
the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan was studied in a one-hour feeding paradigm in rats. in this study, irbesartan was investigated in
comparison with fenfluramine, an established satiating drug, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor captopril. we found a
significant reduction of one-hour food intake following 100–200 mg/kg (i.p.) irbesartan. the ace inhibitor captopril (25–100 mg/kg i.p.) remained
without effect on food intake and fenfluramine showed the expected hypophagic action starting at 1 mg/kg (i.p.). the hypophagic effect of irbesartan
could not be attributed to sedation or any gross effect on motor activity as determined both upon feeding and independent activity experiments.
fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) and irbesartan (100 mg/kg) did not reduce the latency to feed, but similarly reduced the eating rate at the beginning of the test
meal. in conclusion, the present study demonstrates a hypophagic effect of the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan that cannot be attributed
to sedation or antidipsic effects of the drug.

1. introduction
an increasing prevalence of obesity over the last decades has
been reported from many countries. hence, a considerable
scientific interest emerged to elucidate the physiological
mechanisms underlying eating and satiety as well as their
pathophysiological disturbances leading to obesity. obesity is a
major risk factor for hypertension. weight loss in turn decreases
blood pressure. the major endocrine factor to control blood
pressure is angiotensin. the octapeptide  xxxg99xxx  is a
potent vasoconstrictor, induces thirst, vasopressin release,
sodium appetite, norepinephrine excretion, and adrenocortico⁎ corresponding author. university of nottingham, school of veterinary

tropic hormone (acth) and aldosterone release. synthesis of
 xxxg99xxx  starts out from  xxxg99xxx , a circulating
peptide from the liver.  xxxg99xxx  is enzymatically cleaved
from  xxxg99xxx  by the action of renin.  xxxg99xxx  in
turn is converted into  xxxg99xxx  by the angiotensin
converting enzyme (ace). the predominant effects of  xxxg99xxx , i.e. its action on blood pressure and water balance, are
mediated by angiotensin at1 receptors. however, also  xxxg101xxx  and
at4 receptors have been described (unger et al., 1996).
interestingly, antihypertensive drugs such as ace-inhibitors
and angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonists are particularly
beneficial in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients
(scheen, 2004; zaman et al., 2002).
in animal experiments, various metabolic effects of angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonists have been described. thus, the
angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  augmented
glucose uptake into adipocytes and also the expression of
glucose transporter glut4 expression (fujimoto et al., 2004).

 xxxd3303xxx  reduced glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in
rats fed a high-fat diet (benson et al., 2004) and improved insulin
sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice (schupp et al., 2005).
an observational study in a large group of patients revealed
favourable metabolic effects on lipids and blood glucose for the
angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan (bramlage et al.,
2004). preceding experiments with irbesartan showed an
amelioration of obesity and hyperinsulinemia in a genetically
determined mouse model (ortlepp et al., 2002). further
metabolic actions of irbesartan in animals include improved
insulin sensitivity in obese zucker rats (henriksen et al., 2001;
clasen et al., 2005) and transgenic hypertensive rats (sloniger et
al., 2005), and reduced growth and differentiation of adipocytes
within the adipose tissue (di filippo et al., 2005). long term
treatment with irbesartan not only improved triglyceride
metabolism, but also increased survival rate in obese zucker
rats (janiak et al., 2006).
a few studies also addressed a possible effect of angiotensin
 xxxg100xxx  antagonists on body weight development. benson
et al. (2004) found a diminished increase in body weight after
5 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3303xxx  in rats fed with a high-fat
diet. the other antagonist studied, losartan, remained without
effect in this study. preliminary data also showed very recently a
body weight reduction after 4 weeks of treatment with
candesartan which was paralleled by diminished food intake
(raasch et al., 2006).
it is unknown so far, if, despite their long-term effects,
sartanes act also on short-term food intake following acute drug
administration. therefore, the present study was aimed at
investigating possible effects of irbesartan on food intake. since
irbesartan was shown along with the ace inhibitor captopril to
have beneficial metabolic effects in animal experiments
(ortlepp et al., 2002), the ace inhibitor was included in this
study. both drugs were also compared with fenfluramine as a
reference compound for a hypophagic drug action.
2. material and methods
2.1. subjects
eight weeks old male sprague dawley rats (versuchstierzucht
schoenwalde, further bred for two generations in our animal
facility) weighing between 180 and 220 g were housed in groups

of 5 under standard laboratory conditions (laboratory diet
altromin 1326, 12 h light/dark cycle, room temperature 22 ±
2 °c). a local institutional review committee approved the study.
2.2. drugs
2.2.1. irbesartan
irbesartan (sanofi-aventis, deutschland) was suspended
with one drop cremophor el in 0.9% saline. rats were treated
with 50–200 mg/kg body weight irbesartan. all control animals
received an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline plus one drop
cremophor el.
2.2.2. captopril
captopril (sigma-aldrich, germany) was dissolved in 0.9%
saline and ph-adjusted with 1m naoh. rats were treated with
25–100 mg/kg body weight captopril. all control animals
received an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline.
2.2.3. fenfluramine
d/l-fenfluramine (sigma-aldrich, germany) was dissolved
in 0.9% saline. rats were treated with 0.3–3 mg/kg body weight
fenfluramine. all control animals received an equivalent volume
of 0.9% saline.
all drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a
volume of 10 ml/kg body weight. fenfluramine and irbesartan
were administered 30 min before the feeding experiment and
captopril was administered 60 min before testing.
2.3. feeding experiments
2.3.1. experiments performed in feeding boxes
all feeding experiments were performed in independent
groups of rats between 0900 h and 1200 h. they were conducted
in feeding boxes (coulborn instruments, usa) where food
intake was measured for each rat individually. rats were adapted
to the feeding procedure for three consecutive days. for this
purpose, they were allowed to explore the feeding box for 1 h per
day. the box was equipped with a feeder and a water supply.
rats had access to food pellets by breaking the photobeams of
the feeder with a nose poke response. the feeder was
programmed to drop one 45 mg grain based dustless precision
pellet (bioserv, usa) per light beam interruption. rats also had

free access to water throughout the feeding experiments. access
to the water bottle was also registered by photobeam interruptions. a movement detector was mounted on top of the ceiling to
measure locomotor activity of the rats. responses were recorded
automatically by an ibm pc-compatible microcomputer using a
habitest 0208-lablink interface (coulbourn instruments, usa).
data were acquired by graphic state 2 software (coulbourn
instruments, usa) with a 1 min time bin analysis. sixteen hours
before starting the experiments, rats were deprived of food. after
drug administration, rats were allowed to feed for 1 h. the
following parameters were determined:
1. total amount eaten as expressed by the number of pellets.
this was corrected by subtracting the number of pellets
obtained from the feeder, but not eaten. however, the
number of non-eaten pellets was extremely low and only one
rat was excluded from data processing due to a significant
number of non-eaten pellets.
2. frequency of drinking (photobeam interruption)
3. locomotor activity (units)
4. latency to feed (min)
5. mean number of feeding bouts. one bout is separated from
another by at least 1 one minute non-feeding interval.
6. feeding rate during the first 5 min of the experiment. during
this time most of the pellets were eaten across treatment
groups.
2.3.2. control feeding experiment with limited access to water
since one dose of irbesartan (100 mg/kg) had an effect not
only on feeding, but also on drinking, a control experiment was

performed. two groups of rats were food deprived and exposed
to the same feeding procedure as described before. neither of
the two groups was drug treated. however, in one group, water
was removed from the supply at a certain time point during the
experiment, to see if limited access to water under these
conditions would have an impact on the amount of pellets eaten.
the amount of available water was approximated the amount of
water the rats drunk in the feeding experiment after 100 mg/kg
irbesartan.
2.3.3. feeding experiments in the home cage
to exclude artefacts due to different baseline food intake in
control groups upon testing in feeding boxes, an additional
feeding experiment was performed. the only difference in
experimental conditions as described before was that this
particular experiment was conducted under home cage conditions rather than in automated feeding boxes. the hypophagic
effects of irbesartan (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and
fenfluramine (3 mg/kg i.p.) were studied.
2.4. activity measurements
to exclude any interfering locomotor effects of the drugs
with food intake, a control experiment was performed. freely
feeding rats were exposed to a procedure similar to the feeding
experiment, except that they were not subjected to a feeding
box, but transferred to a new housing cage equipped with
movement detectors. in analogy to the feeding experiment,
locomotor activity was recorded with a pc-driven inframotactivity system (tse-systems, germany) at 1 min time bins

for a total of 1 h. hypophagic doses of fenfluramine (1 mg/kg)
and irbesartan (100 mg/kg) were tested in comparison.
2.5. statistics
all between groups comparisons of more than two groups
were performed with anova followed by dunnet's test and
between two groups comparison were made with student's
t-test. significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. data are
expressed as means ± s.e.m.
3. results
the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan (100 and
200 mg/kg) reduced food intake significantly [f(3,37) = 7.24,
p < 0.001], but had no effect on locomotor activity. in addition,
only 100 mg/kg irbesartan reduced water intake [f(3,37) = 4.50,

p < 0.01] (fig. 1). however, irbesartan had no effect on
drinking in feeding experiments performed in the home cage.
here, 100 mg/kg irbesartan also reduced food intake (control:
4.18 ± 0.39 g/h vs. irbesartan: 1.93 ± 0.50 g/h; t = 3.50 df = 18,
p < 0.01), but not water intake (control: 4.06 ± 0.44 ml/h vs.
irbesartan 3.01 ± 0.70 ml/h; n.s.).
there was also a clear and dose dependent hypophagic effect
of fenfluramine, starting at 1 mg/kg [f(3,37) = 7.03, p < 0.01].
the higher dose of 3 mg/kg also reduced water intake, whereas
no significant effect on locomotor activity was observed (fig. 2).
in contrast to irbesartan and fenfluramine, the ace inhibitor
captopril did not change food intake and water intake, although
a tendency (p < 0.10) towards a reduced locomotor activity was
observed (fig. 3).
the latencies to feed were not significantly altered by irbesartan
and fenfluramine. the higher dose of 3 mg/kg fenfluramine
reduced the number of bouts significantly [f(3,37) = 9.38,

p < 0.001], whereas irbesartan had no significant effect of the
number of feeding bouts (fig. 4).
irbesartan attenuated the feeding rate dose-dependently [f
(3,36) = 8.68, p < 0.001]. such an effect was similarly observed
after fenfluramine treatment [f(3,37) = 8.73, p < 0.001] (fig. 5).
the control experiment on the relation between feeding and
water intake revealed no evidence for a significant impact of
limited access to water on food intake under the present
conditions (fig. 6).
irbesartan (100 mg/kg) also reduced food intake under home
cage conditions [f(2,35) = 12.76, p < 0.001] as did fenfluramine
(3 mg/kg; t = 1.76 df = 18, p < 0.05). obviously, behavior in
vehicle treated control groups was the same (table 1).
in addition, no significant effects of 1 mg/kg fenfluramine and
100 mg/kg irbesartan were observed when locomotor activity
was measured independently from feeding experiments (fig. 7).
4. discussion
the present study demonstrates a significant hypophagic
effect of the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan, but
not of the ace inhibitor captopril on short-term food intake.
as shown in control experiments, this hypophagic effect
cannot be attributed to unspecific sedation or to a primarily
reduced water intake. although control groups showed a
different food intake across experiments, it is unlikely that
these differences had an impact on the outcome of the study. the
feeding experiment performed under home cage conditions also
revealed significant hypophagic effects of irbesartan and
fenfluramine as shown in the automated feeding boxes, but
there was no difference in the amount eaten in the control groups.
although there is a proven relationship between feeding and
drinking with a reduction of food intake due to water deficiency

and an involvement of  xxxg99xxx  in eating induced drinking
(fitzsimons and le magnen, 1969; kraly and corneilson, 1990),
such a partly reduced access to water as utilized here was not
sufficient enough to affect feeding. in addition, feeding
experiments performed in the home cage did show the same
hypophagic effect of irbesartan, but did not show the reduced
water intake. in keeping with our data, a previous study
demonstrated that a complete water deprivation at the beginning
of the dark phase took effect on feeding not before 45 min
(schoorlemmer and evered, 2002). the present study could not
find a hypophagic effect for captopril, suggesting that not every
interference with the renin angiotensin system (ras) will result
in hypophagia. although at least one rat study reported a reduced
food intake following captopril (di nicolantonio and weisinger,
1988), the fenfluramine data presented here verify the necessary
sensitivity of our feeding paradigm.
to our knowledge, clinical studies have not addressed this
particular issue despite the fact that angiotensin  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists proved to have beneficial metabolic effects (kurtz
and pravenec, 2004). two experimental studies investigated
daily food intake under long-term treatment with angiotensin
 xxxg100xxx  antagonists. one study (benson et al., 2004) found
a reduced daily food intake upon  xxxd3303xxx  but not losartan
treatment. another recent study reported a lessened daily food
intake upon candesartan (raasch et al., 2006). although none of
these studies investigated the effects on short-term food intake,
the question arises if this could be a common property of
angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonists, i.e., could there be a
common underlying physiological mechanism? with regard to
mechanisms underlying the metabolic effects of sartanes, an
action at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppar)gamma has been proposed (schupp et al., 2004).  xxxg1807xxx 
is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in lipid
metabolism and insulin sensitivity (auwerx, 1999; picard and
auwerx, 2002).
thiazolidinediones are full agonists at this receptor and have
been introduced as antidiabetic drugs already, but show
increased body weight in patients as a side effect (reginato
and lazar, 1999; fonseca, 2003). the mechanisms underlying
the metabolic effects of angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonists
have been suggested to be a partial agonism of  xxxg1807xxx 
(benson et al., 2004), but also a mixed angiotensin  xxxg100xxx 
antagonism and  xxxg1807xxx  agonism (clasen et al., 2005).

fig. 7. independent measures of locomotor activity: effects of irbesartan (100 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1 mg/kg).

obviously, not all angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  agonists have a
similar activity at the  xxxg1807xxx  receptor and not all of them
have been studied with regards to effects on body weight. erbe
et al. (2006) give a critical review on this issue. therefore, a
general conclusion on the mechanisms underlying the hypophagic effect of irbesartan would still be a matter of speculation,
for two reasons. firstly, there is no evidence so far if other
angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonists also have effects on shortterm food intake, and, secondly, the underlying mechanisms are
not necessarily the same for the hypophagic and metabolic
effects. this may be particularly true, since the hypophagic
effect was observed after relatively high, albeit non-toxic doses
of irbesartan. a reduced blood pressure that could be expected
from a blockade of angiotensin at1 receptors should possibly
result in reduced locomotor activity (singh et al., 1990).
however, our data do not indicate any significant effects on
locomotor activity, and cardiovascular effects in normotensive
rats are likely to occur at even higher doses of irbesartan
(emea 2004, online). the recent data from raasch et al. (2006)
suggest the involvement of further mechanisms known to be
related to the physiological control of feeding behavior. in
particular a down regulation of the orexigenic hypothalamic
peptides mch and orexin seems to be involved. this study also
indicates a central site of action for metabolic effects of
candesartan which is in line with earlier pharmacological work
demonstrating the ability of sartanes to cross the blood brainbarrier (polidori et al., 1998; culman et al., 1999). from a
behavioral point of view, the effects of irbesartan and
fenfluramine on feeding parameters show some similarity.
thus, both drugs do not affect the latency to feed and, at lower
doses also preserve the bout structure during the one-hour test
meal. in addition, however, both drugs reduce the feeding rate.
this has already been known for fenfluramine from animal and
human studies for a long time (simansky, 1998 for review) and
deserves further investigation. a reduction of the eating rate
could possibly be associated with physiological processes of
satiety (rogers and blundell, 1979). in conclusion, the present
study demonstrates a hypophagic effect of irbesartan that cannot
be attributed to sedation or antidipsic effects of the drug.
