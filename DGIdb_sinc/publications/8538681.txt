abstract
the gene encoding the bifunctional  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) and  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) of trypanosoma
has been isolated and expressed in escherichia coli, and the enzyme has been purified and characterized. the
coding sequence of the dhfr-ts is 1581 nt, encoding a 527-amino-acid protein of 58505 da. the gene was expressed
under control of the trc promoter in pkk233-2. the resulting expression plasmid conferred trimethoprim resistance to e.
coli dh~ci and complemented
the ts deficiency in x2913reca cells indicating the presence of active dhfr and ts.
dhfr-ts was purified by methotrexate-sepharose
chromatography.
in addition to the full-length enzyme, the purified
enzyme contained 31 and 31.5~kda forms of the enzyme that cross-reacted with anti-l. major dhfr-ts antibodies; one
was truncated at the n- and c termini, and the other at only the c terminus. despite the presence of sufficient ts for
complementation,
ts activity was not detectable in the crude extract or in the final purified enzyme preparation. although
the majority of the enzyme appears to be full length, it is possible that the ts domain has been degraded by one of more
residues, which would inactivate the ability to synthesize thymidylate. kinetic analysis of dhfr yielded k,,, and k,
values similar to those of related enzymes. the t. brucei dhfr has ki values for antimicrobial antifolates pyrimethamine
and trimethoprim which are significantly lower than the closely related t. cruzi or l. major dhfrs or than human dhfr.

1. introduction
ts and dhfr catalyze sequential reactions in the
de novo synthesis of  xxxd3365xxx . ts catalyzes the reductive methylation of dump with methylenetetrahydrofolate to give  xxxd3365xxx  and dihydrofolate (dhf); dhfr
catalyzes the subsequent nadph-dependent
reduction of dhf to regenerate the tetrahydrofolate (thf)
necessary for continued  xxxd3365xxx  synthesis. dhfr is
usually a monomer of about 20 kda [ll and ts is a
dimer of identical subunits of about 35kda each [2].
in protozoa and higher plants, ts and dhfr exist as
a bifunctional homodimeric protein of 110-140 kda;
the dhfr domain is at the n terminus and is
separated from the ts domain by a junction peptide
that varies in size [3-91. the genes from several
protozoans have been cloned and sequenced [57,10,11], and the enzymes from l. major, p. falciparum and t. cruzi have been expressed in heterologous systems [ll-141.
because of their central role in dna synthesis
and cellular metabolism, ts and dhfr have been
common
targets for potential
chemotherapeutic
agents.
the
antifolates
trimethoprim
(tmp),
pyrimethamine
(pyr) and cycloguanil are potent inhibitors of dhfrs from many bacteria and some
protozoa, while the human enzyme is relatively unaffected. l. major dhfr, the only purified dhfr
from a kinetoplastid previously studied with antifolates, is not selectively inhibited by these inhibitors

wi.
trypanosoma brucei, the causative
agent of
african sleeping sickness, remains a serious world
health problem. it is one of the few remaining
pathogenic protozoans for which the bifunctional
dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate
synthase
(dhfr-ts) is not yet available. in the present paper,
we describe the isolation, sequencing and expression
of the bifunctional
dhfr-ts gene from t. brucei
brucei. we also describe the purification and characterization of the enzyme including the striking sensitivity of t. brucei dhfr to the antifolates, tmp and
pyr.
2. materials and methods

2.1. materials
e. coli k12 strain le392 [16] was used for
plating h phage. a zapii was from stratagene (la

72 (19951 11-22

jolla, ca, usa). e. coli strains x2913reca, a thystrain [17], and pa414, a fol-, thy- strain [18], were
used for ts complementation
analysis and dhfr-ts
protein expression, respectively.
dhsa competent
cells (purchased from brl, gaithersburg, md, usa)
were used to test trimethoprim resistance. the expression vector pet-15b and the e. coli host strains
bl21(de3) and bl21(de3)plyss
were from novagen (madison, wi, usa). the ta cloning vector
pcrloo0 and the e. coli strain invcvf’ were purchased from invitrogen
(san diego, ca, usa).
expression vectors pkk233-2 [19] and pkk223-3
[20] were from pharmacia lkb biotechnology (uppsala, sweden). the yeast vectors pbslo0 and
pab24 and the s. cereviciae strain ai3116 were
kindly provided by p. olson (chiron). geneclean
was obtained from biolol (la jolla, ca, usa),
prep-a-gen
from bio-rad (hercules, ca, usa),
qiagen columns from qiagen (chatsworth,
ca,
usa), the genius kit from boehringer-mannheim
(mannheim, germany) and the sequenase kit from
us biochemical (cleveland, oh, usa). restriction
enzymes were obtained from new england biolabs
(beverly, ma, usa) or gibco brl. nitrocellulose
membranes were from schleicher & schuell (keene,
nh, usa) and problott, a polyvinylidine
difluoride
(pvdf) membrane compatible with protein sequencing, was from applied biosystems (foster city, ca,
usa). all other reagents have been described previously [12,13,21] or were of the highest purity commercially available. oligonucleotides
were synthesized in the biomolecular
resource center at the
university of california (san francisco, ca, usa).
2.2, dna manipulations
general methods for dna manipulations
and
transformation
were performed as described [16].
purification
of plasmids for sequencing
was performed using the qiagen procedure. dna fragments
were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis
and
purified using prep-a-gen or geneclean. to clone
synthetic oligonucleotides,
200 pmol of each strand
were heated to 92°c for 2 min, followed by annealing at 37°c for 2 h. annealed duplexes were ligated
to endonuclease digested vectors at molar ratios of
1o:l and 2o:l (100 ng of vector in 25 ~1) and the
ligated products were transformed
into e. cofi
dh5o.

2.3. preparation of a hybridization probe using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
 xxxd3426xxx -bp dna fragment encoding a highly conserved region of ts (amino acids 145-231 l. casei
ts numbering) was prepared by pcr amplification.
the primers used were on 1 and 2 of edman [22]
and the template was 500 ng of t. brucei genomic
dna, strain 427 (obtained from dr. debra barnes,
wbhii, australia). pcr was carried out using a
perkin-elmer
cetus (norwalk,
ct, usa) dna
thermocycler. reaction conditions and pcr parameters were as described [22]. after analysis on a 5%
polyacrylamide gel, the pcr product was isolated by
low-melting-point
agarose gel electrophoresis (ls%,
seakem nusieve agarose), purified using geneclean
(biolol),
digested with ecori and barnhi, extracted with phenol/chloroform,
ethanol precipitated
and cloned into m13mp18 as described [22].
2.4. screening of genomic dna library and isolation
of plasmids
a genomic library from t. brucei (strain 427) in
a zap11 was kindly provided by drs. m. phillips
and a. campbell from the hormone research institute (university
of california, san francisco, ca,
usa). the titer of the library was determined to be
5.2 x lo* pfu ml-’ by plating on le392 cells on
nzcym plates. the average insert size was 2-4 kb.
140000 plaques at a density of 20000 plaques per
plate were screened for the presence of ts sequence
by overlaying
plates with nitrocellulose
filters in
duplicate. filters were denatured, neutralized, washed
in 20 x ssc and baked for 2 h [16]. prehybridization
was performed by incubation in blocking buffer (5 x
ssc/s%
blocking
reagent
(boehringermannheim)/o.l%
n-lauryl
sarcosine,
sodium
salt/0.02%
sds/50%
formamide) at 42°c for 4 h.
the gel-purified hybridization probe was labeled with
digoxigenin using the genius kit (boehringer-mannheim), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions,
and hybridization
was performed as described [16].
three positive isolates were plaque-purified,
and
phagemids were rescued by coinfection of e. coli
le392 with helper phage r408 as described [23].
dna was prepared from the three independent clones
and mapped by digestion with the restriction en-

13

zymes ecori, barnhi, sal1 and hindiii. fragments
containing the internal region of the ts gene homologous to the pcr product probe were identified by
southern transfer blot analysis.
dna sequencing was performed by the dideoxychain-termination
method using the sequenase kit
version 2.0, and by automated dna sequencing
using the dye-dideoxy
method and an applied
biosystems 370a dna sequencer.
2.5, preparation of dhfr-ts coding cassettes
two coding cassettes were prepared. in the first,
restriction sites were added to the dhfr-ts coding
sequence of t. brucei using pcr. pcr primers were

the 3’ end of the gene. the on6 duplex has bamhi
and kpni overhangs. t. brucei coding sequence is
underlined and restriction sites are bold.
2.6. phenotypic characterization of dhfr-ts
pression plasmids

ex-

plasmids were transformed into the thy- strain,
x2913reca,
and individual colonies were plated in
duplicate on minimal agar plates containing 100 pg
ml-’ ampicillin and containing or lacking 50 pg
ml-’ thymine. colonies which express active ts
could be visualized on plates lacking thymine after
overnight incubation at 37°c.
plasmids were transformed into the tmp-sensitive strain e. coli dhsa, and individual colonies
were plated in duplicate on lb plates containing 100
pg ml-’ ampicillin and containing or lacking 40 pg
ml-’ tmp. colonies expressing active dhfr could
be visualized on plates with tmp after overnight
incubation at 37°c.
2.7. growth conditions and preparation of cell extracts
bacterial clones were grown in lb containing 100
pg ml-’ ampicillin and 50 pg ml-’ thymine. for
evaluation of expression products, 50 ml cultures
were grown under different conditions; temperature
of culture and time of growth were varied. cells
were harvested by centrifugation,
washed with 10
mm kh, po,/1
mm edta, ph 7.0 (buffer a)
containing 100 mm kc1 and stored at -80°c. for
enzyme assays, cell pellets were suspended in buffer
a at lo-20-fold
concentration
of the initial culture
volume and lysed by sonication. homogenates were
cleared by centrifugation at 20000 x g for 30 min at
4°c.
2.8. protein purification
the dhfr-deficient
e. coli strain pa414 was
used as a host for ppg3 for the purification
of
dhfr-ts protein. cells were grown overnight at
room temperature (24-25°c) in lb containing 100
pg ml-’ ampicillin.
cell pellets from 3 liters of
culture were suspended in buffer a containing six
protease inhibitors [21] and lysed by two passages
through a french pressure cell at 1800 psi. after

72 (1995) 11-22

centrifugation
at 20000 x g for 30 min, the clear
supernatant was loaded by circulating twice through
a mtx-sepharose
column (1.6 x 6.0 cm) equilibrated in buffer a at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min-‘.
the column was washed with 8 column volumes of
buffer a containing 1 m kc1 followed by 4 column
volumes of buffer a containing 0.5 m kcl. dhfr
activity was eluted with 50 mm tes/l
mm
edta/s
mm dtt, ph 8.0 containing
5 mm
dhf/o.s m kcl. fractions containing dhfr activity were pooled, diluted lo-fold with buffer a, so
that the kc1 concentration was 50 mm, and loaded
onto a column of phosphocellulose
(whatman pll).
the column was washed with buffer a and developed with a linear gradient of o-o.5 m kc1 in
buffer a. fractions containing dhfr activity were
pooled and concentrated.
2.9. protein analysis
protein concentration
was determined
by the
method of bradford [24] using bsa as a standard.
dhfr and ts activities were measured spectrophotometrically as described [21]. one unit of dhfr is
the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 pmol
of product per min at 25°c. for determination
of
kinetic parameters, the concentration of one substrate
was held constant while the concentration
of the
other was varied. at low dhf concentrations,
a
cuvette with a lo-cm path was used to increase the
signal. ph-rate profiles were determined
using a
constant ionic strength buffer system described by
ellis and morrison [25]. inhibition of dhfr by tmp
and pyr was measured by varying the concentration
of inhibitor in a reaction mixture containing 2.5 nm
enzyme and 20 pm dhf. the equation for competitive inhibition from segel [26] was used to calculate
k,, ts-fdump-ch,thf
covalent complexes were
formed [27,28] and analyzed by sds-page (10%
polyacrylamide)
[29]. the gels were stained with
coomassie blue and fluorography was carried out as
described 1301.
western blot analysis was performed as described
[31], using rabbit antiserum containing
antibodies
raised against l. major dhfr-ts [32]. crude serum
was preadsorbed against an extract of sonified’ e.
coli ~2913reca to reduce the background of e. coli
proteins.

tate cloning. these primers were used in a pcr
reaction with t. brucei genomic dna as a template
to amplify a single approx. 300-bp product. this
fragment was cleaved at the ecori and bamhi sites
of the primers and cloned into m13mp18. dna
sequence analysis verified that the amplified fragment encoded an amino-acid sequence which corresponded to ts.
approx. 140000 plaques from a t. brucei genomic dna library in a zap11 were screened with
the cloned homologous probe. three clones, ptbts5,
ptbts6 and ptbts7, were identified, plaque purified and rescued as phagemids. the phagemids were
characterized by restriction enzyme mapping with
ecori, barnhi, sal1 and hindiii. southern blot
analysis of the fragments together with the sequence
analysis described below established that ptbts7
contained the entire coding sequence of dhfr-ts
while ptbts5 and ptbts6 contained a 3’ portion of
the ts gene plus differing amounts of flanking dna
(fig. 1).

3.2. dna sequence analysis
double-strand
sequencing of the complete gene
was carried out using ptbts7 as a template. internal
fragments (2.7-kb ecori, 1.4-kb ecori-hindiii,
0.6
and 0.7-kb hindiii) were subcloned into m13mp18
and also used as sequencing templates. in addition,
ptbts5 and ptbts6 were used as templates with
the ml3 reverse sequencing
primer and the t7
primer. analysis of the sequence yielded a single
open reading frame of 1581 nt encoding a 527amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass
of 58505 da. the met codon assigned as initiation
codon is the first atg in the open reading frame and
it is preceded by several in-frame termination codons.
the tag amber codon at nt 1582 is the first termination codon in the reading frame, and the c-terminal val is consistent with the conserved c terminus
of ts [34]. there are no intervening sequences within
the coding region of dhfr-ts. the coding sequence for dhfr-ts has an average g + c content
of 51.1% compared to 44.5% g + c found in both
the 5’ and 3’-untranslated regions.
the deduced t. brucei dhfr-ts amino-acid sequence is shown aligned with the t. cruzi sequence

in fig. 2. these two dhfr-ts sequences are very
similar with an overall identity of approx. 70%.

of dhfr-ts

expression

rlectors

two different coding cassettes were generated
from the complete dhfr-ts coding sequence of
ptbts7. restriction sites were added to the 5’ and 3’
ends of the dhfr-ts gene using pcr primers. the
pcr product was cloned into pcrloo0 to yield
pcr-tbl
which contained
the dhfr-ts
gene
flanked by ecori and psti sites. the gene was
excised at these sites and subcloned into ecori +
psti-digested
pkk223-3 to yield ppg1. the sequence of the gene was determined, and a pcr-derived mutation was discovered in the dhfr domain,
a second coding cassette was assembled using
synthetic duplex dna to add restriction sites to the
5’ and 3’ ends. a 1495-bp bspmi-clai
fragment
from ptbts7 containing most of the gene plus two
short synthetic duplexes were cloned into puc18 as
diagrammed in fig. 3. a bspmi site which creates
an ncoi overhang was placed at the atg start
codon. the coding sequence was subcloned into the
e. coli vector, pkk233-2, to yield ppg2 in which
production of bifimctional enzyme is driven from the
trc promoter. however, sequence analysis of ppg2
revealed that a mutation had been incorporated into
the gene in the synthetic c-terminal region of the ts
domain. the presence of this mutation necessitated
construction of ppg3, which is a composite of correct sequences from ppg1 and ppg2. the sequence
of the short ctui-psti fragment (nt 1538-1581 of the
coding sequence) of the pcr-derived cassette was
exchanged into ppg2 to yield ppg3, which contains
the entire authentic dhfr-ts coding sequence.

expression of the dhfr and ts domains. each
plasmid conferred tmp resistance to dh5a signifying the presence of active dhfr, and each supported
complementation
of thye. coli signifying
the
presence of active ts. ppg1, ppg2 and ppg3 were
transformed into the dhfr-, thy- pa414 background to measure enzyme activities in vitro. crude

dhfr activity was measured after culture at different temperatures
and after different time periods.
temperatures below 37°c the optimal growth temperature for e. coli, yielded higher enzyme activities.
in an attempt to further improve expression of the
enzyme, we cloned the expression cassette into the
t7 expression vector, pet-lsb, and the yeast expression vector, pah24. no ts activity was detectable in
either system, and no improvement in the expression
level of dhfr was observed (data not shown).

the kinetic parameters for dhfr were determined under standard assay conditions. the k, for
dhf was 0.6 pm, the k, for nadph was 0.9
pm, and the k,, was 5 s-l. the effects of ionic
strength, urea and ph on dhfr activity were measured. increasing ionic strength by adding either
nacl or kc1 stimulated activity approx. 2.5-3-fold
at 0.1 m and activity remained at a plateau up to 1.0
m. urea added to the reaction mixture stimulated
activity moderately increasing the rate approx. 1.5fold with a broad peak at 0.75-1.5 m. further
increases in urea concentration resulted in decreased

specific activity so that only 10% of the activity
remained at 3.8 m urea. dhfr activity was nearly
constant between ph 5.0 and 8.0.
ts activity in the mtx-sepharose pool was very
low (approx. 0.01 u mg-‘1, and activity was undetectable in the final concentrated pool. therefore
determination of the kinetic parameters could not be
performed. partially purified dhfr-ts formed a
covalent complex with fdump which could be isolated using sds-page [27,28].
western blot analysis of a gel similar to that
shown in fig. 4 showed that the major band cross-reacted with anti l. major dhfr-ts antibodies. two
additional poorly resolved bands at approx. 31 and
31.5 kda (visible in fig. 4) also cross-reacted with
the l. major dhfr-ts antibodies (data not shown).
the smaller bands were blotted to problott and
sequenced together. two sequences were obtained;
one was mlsltri-rk, the n terminus of dhfr.
the other sequence, kkipvhelag, was also from
the dhfr domain starting at the lys residue at
position 10. thus, the minor bands represent partial
dhfr-ts polypeptides comprising the dhfr domain plus part of the ts domain. western blot
analysis of whole cells showed a similar pattern of
cross-reacting bands at 59, 31 and 31.5 kda, indicating that the fragments are present in vivo.
dhfr inhibition constants (k, values) for tmp
and pyr were 0.23 and 0.28 nm, respectively. these
values are compared with the ki values for l.
major, t. cruzi and human dhfrs in table 3. t.
brucei dhfr has ki values 4-fold lower and 103fold lower than human dhfr for pyr and tmp,
respectively. l. major and t. cruzi dhfrs have

f. gamarro et al. /molecular

and biochemical parasitology

similar patterns of sensitivity to pyr and tmp; compared to t. brucei dhfr the ki values for these
enzymes are more than loo-fold higher for pyr and
more than 4000-fold higher for tmp. the ki values
for these two drugs are also somewhat higher than
the human dhfr ki values.

4. discussion
in this paper we describe the isolation and sequencing of the bifunctional gene encoding t. brucei
dhfr-ts, the expression of the gene in e. coli and
the characterization
of the purified enzyme.
to isolate the dhfr-ts gene, a homologous
probe was first constructed
by pcr. degenerate
primers based on highly conserved amino-acid sequences of ts were used to amplify an approx.
300-bp fragment of the target sequence. the probe
was then used screen a genomic library of t. brucei
in a zapii. one of the three overlapping positive
clones contained the complete dhfr-ts gene. the
genomic organization
of t. brucei has not been
studied; however in related organisms, dhfr-ts is
encoded by a single-copy gene [6,11,14,36]. dna
sequencing
of the clone containing
the complete
gene revealed a single open reading frame encoding
a 527-amino-acid
protein with a predicted molecular
mass of 58505 da. the deduced amino-acid
sequence of t. brucei dhfr-ts is very similar to that
reported for t. cruzi (70% identity); the sequence is
also quite similar to the l. major dhfr-ts with an
overall identity of 60%. alignments of t. cruzi and
l. major with other protozoan dhfr-ts sequences
plus sequences of selected monofunctional
enzymes
can be found in refs. 10, 11 and 37.
amino-acids
l-240 are designated as the dhfr
domain. comparison with the structures of monofunctional dhfrs [38,39] and the recently reported
structure of l. major dhfr-ts [37] indicates that
residues 229-237 comprise a conserved p strand of
dhfr; three additional residues were assigned to the
dhfr domain to conform to the c-termini of monofunctional dhfrs. residues 241-527 are designated
as the ts domain. glu-244 is the first highly conserved residue in the ts domain; most monofunctional tss have either a glu or an asp at this
position and at least a few residues preceding this

72 (1995) ii-22

19

conserved residue. these limits on domain boundaries leave only a few residues as a junction peptide
in the t. brucei dhfr-ts. a similar analysis applied to l. major and t. cruzi dhfr-ts leads to the
same conclusion. indeed, the l. major three-dimensional structure verifies a very direct tether between
p-strand h at the c terminus of the dhfr domain
and the initial a-helix of the ts domain [37]. in
contrast, the p. falciparum and t. gondi bifunctional
enzymes display long linker regions between the two
enzyme domains [6,10].
using the vector ppg3, where expression is driven
by the trc promoter, and a temperature of 25°c for
cell growth, the dhfr-ts gene was expressed to a
level of about 0.25% of the soluble cell protein.
based on western blot analysis (data not shown)
additional enzyme is present in cell pellets, presumably as inclusion bodies. the coding sequence was
subcloned into other vectors for expression in e. coli
and saccharomyces, but none provided an improvement in the soluble expression level.
the ability of ppg3 to complement thy- e. coli
cells on media lacking thymine clearly indicated the
presence of catalytically active ts. from data on the
levels of ts necessary to complement thy- e. coli
[40], there should have been sufficient ts to detect
by conventional
in vitro assays. however, no ts
activity was detectable by the spectrophotometric
assay in crude extract or purified enzyme, indicating
a loss of ts activity during the isolation procedure.
one possibility for this loss is proteolytic degradation. proteins of 31 and 31.5 kda were present on
sds-page of crude extracts and also represented
the major contaminants
of purified preparations.
these proteins cross-reacted
with anti-l. major
dhfr-ts; one had n-termini corresponding
to authentic dhfr and the other a form truncated by nine
amino acids. since there is no start codon preceding
the n terminus at residue 10, it must have arisen by
proteolytic cleavage rather than a false translational
start as observed in plasmodium dhfr-ts expressed in e. coli [14]. having shown that the
n-termini of the 31 and 31.5~kda polypeptides are at
or near the dhfr n terminus, it follows that the
c-termini are within ts with about 25 kda missing
from the c terminus of the bifunctional protein. our
data do not address the origin of the c terminus of
the fractional length polypeptides; they could have

20

f. gamarro et al. /molecular

and biochemical parasitology

arisen from either premature translational termination or proteolytic cleavage; however, in the case of
l. major dhfr-ts, protease sensitive sites have
been identified within the ts domain [32]. one of
these sites yielded a product of 31.6 kda, nearly
identical to the products observed here. garvey and
santi [32] also showed that ts activity of l. major
dhfr-ts was lost more rapidly than degradation
could be observed by sds-page; they concluded
that sequential degradations of the c terminus occurred. indeed, it has been shown that the loss of a
single residue from the c terminus of monofunctional ts eliminates thymine synthesis while leaving
intact partial reactions such as the easily detectable
fdump reaction [28,41]. we suggest that similar
degradations at the c terminus of 2’.brucei dhfr-ts
may occur to give a loss of ts activity without
detectable decrease in size of the protein, together
with cleavage of a large fragment of the ts domain
and the n terminus.
even with the aforementioned problems, sufficient amounts of dhfr were available for kinetic
characterization (although as noted above the ts
domain is not active). the k, values for both dhf
and nadph are similar to those determined for
other bifunctional enzymes. the k,, is somewhat
lower, but that could be, in part, a function of the
enzymatic instability. the most significant and interesting property of this dhfr is its potent inhibition
by anti-microbial dhfr inhibitors. t. brucei dhfr
is exquisitely sensitive to both tmp and pyr. interestingly, t. brucei dhfr is inhibited loo-200-fold
more potently in the case of pyr and over 4000-fold
more potently in the case of tmp than the related l.
major and t. cruzi dhfrs. more significant is the
differential sensitivity when compared to human enzyme. t. brucei dhfr is 4-fold more sensitive to
pyr and over 800-fold more sensitive to tmp than
human dhfr. these differential patterns of sensitivity determined using highly purified enzymes confirm observations previously made in crude preparations of t. cruzi, t. brucei and human dhfrs [42].
although conventional antifolates have not been effective in the treatment of trypanosomiasis [43], the
large differential specificity between human and t.
brucei dhfrs’with tmp indicates that the dhfr of
t. brucei could provide a sensitive and selective
target for new chemotherapeutic agents.
