a series of betamethasone 17a-carbamates were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to
dissociate the two main functions of the  xxxg1601xxx , that is, transactivation and transrepression, in rat cell lines. a number of alkyl substituted betamethasone 17a-carbamates were identiﬁed with
excellent afﬁnity for the  xxxg1601xxx  (e.g., 7, gr ic50 5.1 nm) and indicated dissociated proﬁles
in functional assays of transactivation (rat  xxxg2250xxx , tat, and rat  xxxg913xxx ,
gs) and transrepression (human a549 cells,  xxxg1418xxx  assay). gratifyingly, the in-vivo proﬁle of these compounds, for example, 7, also indicated potent anti-inﬂammatory activity with impaired effects on glucose,
insulin, triglycerides, and body weight. taken together, these results indicate that dissociated  xxxg1601xxx  modulators can be identiﬁed in rodents.

1. introduction
glucocorticoids (gcs), for example, betamethasone 1 and prednisolone 2, are among the most effective therapies available for the
treatment of allergic and chronic inﬂammatory diseases.1–3 however, the long-term use of gcs is limited by their severe, and sometimes irreversible, side effects such as diabetes, osteoporosis,
glaucoma, skin atrophy, and muscle wasting. an unmet medical
need, therefore, is the development of agents with improved therapeutic ratios compared to currently available steroids, particularly upon systemic administration. the last decade has provided
important advances in our understanding of the molecular basis
of gc-mediated actions or gene expression, and this work may lead
to the development of improved gcs and more speciﬁc therapies in
the future.4,5 indeed, efforts to identify a new generation of compounds with improved therapeutic proﬁles are currently underway, and recent investigations have focused on the molecular
mechanisms of  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) action.6–9 the effects

of gcs in target tissues are mediated by gr, the expression of
which is ubiquitous. gr is a member of a superfamily of nuclear
receptors, and it modulates gene expression by two different regulatory mechanisms, namely transactivation (ta) and transrepression (tr).10,11 transactivation (ta) depends on the binding of gr
to cis-acting glucocorticoid response elements (gres) in the promoter region of the glucocorticoid target genes leading to an increase in the transcription rate of the respective genes. in
contrast, tr is mediated via protein–protein interactions with
other transcription factors such as ap-112 and nf-jb,13 thereby
suppressing the transcriptional activities of these factors. the dissection of these two mechanisms has been achieved by a single
amino acid substitution in the gr, such as a458t, y735f, and
i747t, which results in reduced transactivational activity.14–16 in
addition, studies of genetically engineered grdim mice that carry
the substitution a458t in the dimerization domain, which impairs
the ability of the gr to bind to dna, revealed that thymocyte apoptosis and erythroblast proliferation require the transactivating
function of gr, whereas the anti-inﬂammatory activity does
not.17 these ﬁndings therefore suggest that gcs lacking transactivation activity, so-called dissociated gcs, would quite likely sepa-

rate the therapeutic effects from the major side effects. in a program aimed at discovering such novel gc ligands while retaining
a major portion of the steroid nucleus for glucocorticoid-like activity, we have synthesized a series of betamethasone derived 17acarbamates represented by the general structure 3. the advantage
of these 17a-carbamate structures is the possible dissociation of
anti-inﬂammatory activity and the associated side effects when
compared to other compounds containing the intact steroidal skeleton. identiﬁcation of such an anti-inﬂammatory steroid would
represent a signiﬁcant structure–activity relationship breakthrough. our initial interest was peaked by recent reports in the literature indicating that certain betamethasone derived steroidal
gcs displayed intriguing in-vivo characteristics. for example, it
has been reported that  xxxd322xxx  exerts much less
thymolytic activity in rats than in mice, although it exhibits strong
therapeutic activity in both species.18 in addition, species speciﬁc
differences in ta function were observed for a series of betamethasone esters.19 also, maternal administration of betamethasone esters induced adrenal hypertrophy in rat fetuses,20 but adrenal
atrophy in mice fetuses,21 whereas betamethasone, dexamethasone, and esteriﬁed dexamethasone induced adrenal atrophy in
both species.22 these observations raise the possibility that betamethasone derivatives can act as dissociated gcs. in the present
study, we have characterized the ta and tr function of a series
of 17a-carbamates derived from betamethasone, both in-vitro
and in-vivo. we demonstrate that these dissociated gcs have potent anti-inﬂammatory activity in the rat with impaired effects
on glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and body weight.

3. biological evaluation

the target compounds were synthesized by the routes as shown
in schemes 1 and 2. the key step involved reaction of the appropriately substituted isocyanates with the monosilyl-protected betamethasone derivative 6. the preparation of 6 began by bis-silyl
protection of betamethasone acetate 4 to afford 5, which was
selectively deprotected using 1.0 m tbaf in acetic acid. treatment
of 6 with a variety of commercially available isocyanates yielded
the desired carbamates, and clean deprotection of both the silyl
and acetyl groups was achieved under acidic conditions (scheme
1). hindered carbamates, for example, 25 were synthesized by
treatment of 6 with excess isocyanate in the presence of a catalytic
amount of copper (i) chloride (scheme 2). non-commercially available isocyanates of interest were prepared by treating a mixture of

the results of the biological evaluation of the compounds are
presented in tables 1–3. each compound was ﬁrst evaluated for
its ability to speciﬁcally bind to the a-isoform of gr in a competition binding assay, which constitutes the primary event in the action of a gr modulator. counter screen binding assays were
routinely performed on a subset of compounds against pr to monitor steroid receptor selectivity and many of the newly synthesized
analogs displayed good selectivity toward gr over pr (table 3).
the ability of the compounds to repress transcription was evaluated by glucocorticoid mediated inhibition of  xxxg1418xxx  expression
as determined by elisa measurement of secreted  xxxg1418xxx  protein
levels from pma stimulated a549 cells. the transactivation potential of each compound was evaluated by its ability to induce tyro-

sine aminotransferase (tat) and  xxxg913xxx  (gs) activity in rat h4 and skeletal muscle cells, respectively. tat is a liver
speciﬁc, gr responsive gene, the product of which initiates tyrosine catabolism.24 gs catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to glutamine, an important regulator of skeletal muscle.25–27 these tat
and gs functional assays were used as markers for hepatic- and
muscle-speciﬁc gr transactivation. in-vivo activity readouts included effects on glucose, insulin, triglyceride, depression of body
weight gain without a change in food consumption, and antiinﬂammatory activity, which constitute signiﬁcant aspects of the
in-vivo proﬁle of a glucocorticoid in the rat. the hgr, transactivation (rtat and rgs), and transrepression ( xxxg1418xxx ) activities for a
selection of compounds are provided in tables 1 and 2.
most of the compounds presented in table 1 exhibited signiﬁcant afﬁnity and selectivity toward the  xxxg1601xxx 
and many bound with approximately the same or better afﬁnity
than prednisolone (ic50 = 13.8 nm). small unbranched alkyl derivatives, for example, r = et 7, bound with exceptional afﬁnity and
selectivity for gr versus pr (ic50 5.1 = nm vs >1000 nm) (table
3). the n-et derivative 7 was evaluated further in functional assays
of ta and tr and, quite gratifyingly, afforded a completely dissoci-

ated proﬁle in rat. interestingly, however, 7 was found to be a potent inducer of gs activity in mouse and human skeletal muscle
cells.28 this apparent species speciﬁc difference in ta activity is
not well understood, but is in line with literature reports for a series of structurally related betamethasone esters.19 in rat, however,
as shown in table 1, 7 exhibited a weak agonist proﬁle in functional assays of ta, yet displayed characteristics of a full agonist
in functional assays of tr. larger alkyl substituents (e.g., 16, 17)
generally led to reduced afﬁnity and selectivity for gr. the introduction of larger substituents also led to partial agonist proﬁles
and produced analogs that no longer appeared to be dissociated.
indeed, an n-butyl substituent (i.e., 9) appeared to be the longest
linear group that could be tolerated while maintaining a fully dissociated proﬁle. both branched alkyl substituents (e.g., 13, 16) and
the introduction of polarity (e.g., 14) led to decreases in afﬁnity and
to less interesting partial agonist proﬁles in our cellular based assays of ta and tr. in fact, our sar studies have shown that among
those variations examined any departure from small straight-chain
alkyl substituents such as n-et of 7, resulted in either loss of afﬁnity for gr or to a partial agonist proﬁle. as shown in table 2, sterically bulkier substituents, for example, n-cyclohexyl 21, were

derivatives n-et 7 (clp 26 ml/min/kg, t1/2 2.2 h, vdss 3.22 l/kg, %f
43) and n-pr 8. on the basis of their dissociated proﬁles in our
in-vitro assays and promising pharmacokinetic data above, 7 and
8 were selected for further in-vivo evaluation. we initially examined 7 under acute inﬂammatory tr conditions using the murine
lps challenge model of inﬂammation.29 thus, upon oral administration of 7, a dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  was observed,
similar for that of prednisolone (ed50 = 0.1 mg/kg for 7 vs 0.5 mg/
kg for prednisolone). figure 1 depicts the dose–response curve
for prednisolone versus 7. the anti-inﬂammatory efﬁcacy of 7
and 8 was also determined in a chronic 7 day rat cotton pellet
granuloma assay30 at total daily doses of 5, 10, and 19 mg/kg given
p.o. b.i.d from day 1. as shown in table 4, compounds 7 and 8 produced dose-dependent inhibition of the cotton pellet granuloma in
female lewis rats on days 4 and 7. at 19 mg/kg, compounds 7 and 8
inhibited the cotton pellet granuloma by 45% and 51%, respectively, and this compared to prednisolone at 2.5 mg/kg which
showed 49% inhibition at this dose. we next turned our attention
toward examining the in-vivo side effect proﬁle of 7 and 8.

data reported were derived from duplicate wells and three independent
experiments. mean ic50 values were determined from 10-point, one-third log
concentration response curves and standard errors were 620%.

4. conclusion
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that a series of 17-a carbamates derived from betamethasone retain signiﬁcant activity
and selectivity for the  xxxg1601xxx . in addition, many

90

triglyceride (mg/dl)

increases in glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels and decreases
in body weight gain constitute signiﬁcant undesired activity of currently available gcs. samples collected from the rat cotton pellet
granuloma study allowed measurement of all of the above parameters and indicated an improved side effect proﬁle for 7 and 8 consistent with a dissociated gr modulator. thus, whereas
administration of prednisolone at 2.5 mg/kg led to signiﬁcant decreases in body weight on day 7 ( 0.4 g ± 2.7 g) versus vehicle
(+14.4 g ± 4.3 g), weight loss with compound 7 at 19 mg/kg on
day 7 was less pronounced (+7.5 g ± 4.6 g). the 7 day organ
weights for the prednisolone treated groups (spleen, thymus, and
adrenal) indicated that these lymphoid organs were subject to
the catabolic actions of the steroid. interestingly, compounds 7
and 8 had similar effects on organ weights compared to the prednisolone treated groups. decreases in plasma insulin and triglyceride levels were also evident (fig. 2) and in the case of plasma
triglyceride levels these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant compared to vehicle. on day 7, the rats were administered
an oral glucose test (ogtt) with dextrose dosed at 3 mg/kg
(fig. 3). rats dosed with 7 exhibited a glucose excursion similar
to vehicle 2 h post dose, while the prednisolone dosed animals possessed a strong spike consistent with conventional steroid therapy.
rats dosed with 8 exhibited a glucose excursion at the higher doses
of 10 and 19 mg/kg, similar to that observed with prednisolone at
2.5 and 6.0 mg/kg (fig. 3). to further proﬁle 7, effects on plasma
glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and % body weight change were assessed in the zucker rat chronic dosing model.31 in this ﬁve day
study, 7 was dosed at 30 mg/kg alongside dexamethasone at
0.3 mg/kg and the gr antagonist ru486 at 30 mpk. as shown in
figure 4, dexamethasone exhibited a profound effect on all four
parameters at low doses. in comparison, the n-et derivative 7
showed little effect on body weight, glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels and the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant compared to vehicle or the gr antagonist  xxxd2643xxx . interestingly, coadministration of compound 7 (30 mg/kg) with dexamethasone
(0.3 mg/kg) led to normalization of glucose, insulin, and body
weight change parameters indicating that 7 was able to antagonize
the ta activity of dexamethasone. a similar effect was observed by
co-administration of the gr antagonist  xxxd2643xxx .

signiﬁcant anti-inﬂammatory response yet showed little effects on
glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels. a reduced catabolic effect
was also observed. taken together, these results indicate that dissociated gr modulators can be identiﬁed in the rat starting from
traditional steroidal platforms and that these compounds may offer therapeutic advantages in the treatment of diseases in which
gr plays a critical role, including inﬂammatory and immunological
disorders.
