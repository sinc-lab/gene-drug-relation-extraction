a chemical biology approach identiﬁes a beta 2 adrenergic
receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) agonist ara-211 ( xxxd2964xxx ), which
causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal
models.  xxxg92xxx  stimulation of camp formation and
 xxxg1836xxx  (pka) activation leads to  xxxg1924xxx  (but
not b-raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of mek-1 kinase
and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (erk)1/2 levels. ara-211 inhibition of the raf/
mek/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is mediated by pka and not
exchange protein activated by camp (epac). ara211 is selective and suppresses p- xxxg1369xxx /2 but not p-jnk,
p-p38, p-akt or p-stat3 levels.  xxxg92xxx  stimulation
results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor
regression in vivo.  xxxg92xxx  antagonists and constitutively
active mek-1 rescue from the effects of ara-211,
demonstrating that  xxxg92xxx  stimulation and mek kinase
inhibition are required for ara-211 antitumor activity.
furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human
tumors where ara-211 induces camp formation and
decreases p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels. thus,  xxxg92xxx  stimulation results
in signiﬁcant suppression of malignant transformation in
cancers where it blocks the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway
by a camp-dependent activation of pka but not epac.

introduction
malignant transformation of normal cells to cancer cells
requires the acquisition of several oncogenic traits such
as uncontrolled cell division, resistance to programmed cell death (apoptosis), invasion and angiogenesis

(hanahan and weinberg, 2000). these malignant
transformation traits are believed to be the consequence
of the accumulation of genetic alterations that result in
deregulated signal transduction circuits. such genetic
alterations can simply be point mutations that result
in constitutive activation of key signal transducers
such as ras, a gtp/gdp binding gtpase that
contributes to 30% of all human cancers (bos, 1989).
alternatively, these alterations can involve entire genes
such as the receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth
factor receptor and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (erbb2) that are found overexpressed
in many major human cancers, including breast and
lung tumors (slamon et al., 1987). often such genetic
alterations result in constitutive activation of common
downstream signal transduction pathways such as
the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase cascades
of several serine/threonine kinases, including  xxxg1924xxx ,
mek-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)1/2,
p38 and  xxxg1372xxx  (jnk) (hagemann and blank, 2001;
johnson and lapadat, 2002). other pathways involved
in uncontrolled proliferation, apoptosis, invasion
and angiogenesis also include those mediated by
the signal transducer and activator of transcription
stat3 and the  xxxg1377xxx  akt (alvarez
and frank, 2004; fresno vara et al., 2004). not
only have these oncogenic and tumor survival pathways
been found constitutively activated in the great majority
of human cancers, but also their hyperactivation
has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance
to chemotherapy in cancer patients (slamon et al.,
1987). this has prompted drug discovery efforts
targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, ras,  xxxg1924xxx ,
mek, akt and stat3 to thwart aberrant signal
transduction pathways in tumor cells (sebolt-leopold
et al., 1999; sebolt-leopold, 2000; weinstein-oppenheimer et al., 2000; blaskovich et al., 2003; redell and
tweardy, 2005). for example, inhibitors of receptor
tyrosine kinases, ras,  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 have all been
identiﬁed and are at various stages of development
(english and cobb, 2002; hao and rowinsky, 2002).
some, like the  xxxg682xxx 
(egfr) kinase inhibitors, iressa and tarceva, were
recently approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of patients with lung cancer
(johnson et al., 2005).

in normal cells, the regulation of the map kinase
pathway is complex. although it is well established that
the activation of erk kinases is regulated by receptor
tyrosine kinases such as egfr and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (pdgfr) via activation of ras,
which in turn activates the  xxxg1924xxx /mek/ xxxg1369xxx /2 cascade
(hagemann and blank, 2001; johnson and lapadat,
2002), more recently, adrenergic receptor (ar) stimulation of camp has also been shown to regulate the
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in normal cells (reviewed in
carman and benovic, 1998; cox et al., 2000; enserink
et al., 2002; stork and schmitt, 2002). for example, in
some normal cells such as cardiac myocytes and bone
cells, camp was shown to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2, whereas in
others such as adipocytes and endothelial cells, it was
shown to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation (vossler et al., 1997;
steinberg, 2000; schmitt and stork, 2001, 2002; troadec
et al., 2002). in tumor cells, however, little is known
about ar regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. in this
manuscript, we have demonstrated that stimulation of
the beta2 adrenergic receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) induces signiﬁcant
tumor growth suppression and tumor regression in
human cancers where this stimulation results in the
inactivation of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway by a
camp-dependent activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka),
but not by the rap1 guanine exchange factor exchange
protein activated by camp (epac).
results
many common genetic alterations in human cancers
result in the hyperactivation of the kinase mek-1,
leading to constitutively phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (hagemann and blank, 2001; johnson and lapadat, 2002).
because aberrant activation of the mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway has been implicated in oncogenesis and tumor
survival, we sought to identify molecules that thwart this
pathway. to this end, we ﬁrst used a chemical biology
approach by screening a 2000 small molecule compound
library (nci diversity set, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/) from
the national cancer institute for pharmacological
agents, capable of suppressing the high levels of perk1/2 in the human breast cancer cell line mda-mb231. treatment of mda-mb-231 cells with compounds
from the nci diversity set (96-well plate assay (25 plates
total), one compound per well – see figure 1a) and
subsequently processing the plates for a cytoblot, using
an antibody speciﬁc for p- xxxg1369xxx /2, resulted in several
compounds that suppress p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels. one of these,
ara-211 (figure 1a) suppressed potently the levels of
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 without affecting the levels of total  xxxg1369xxx /2
(figure 1b).
ara-211 also suppressed p-mek-1 levels but not
p- xxxg1924xxx , p-jnk, p-p38, p-akt or p-stat3 (figure 1b).
these results demonstrated that ara-211 is selective for
disrupting the mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2, but not other oncogenic
and tumor survival pathways. the fact that ara-211
suppressed the levels of p-mek-1 and p- xxxg1369xxx /2 suggested that it might be a  xxxg1924xxx  kinase inhibitor. in vitro
incubation of  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1, immunoprecipitated
oncogene

from mda-mb-231 cells with ara-211, did not inhibit
 xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinase activities (figure 1c). as
expected, the  xxxg1924xxx  kinase inhibitor (rki, emd
biosciences, san diego, ca, usa) and the mek-1
inhibitor ( xxxd3462xxx , emd biosciences, san diego, ca,
usa) blocked  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinase activities
in vitro, respectively (figure 1c). in contrast to the
in vitro studies,  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinase activities were
blocked by ara-211 when intact mda-mb-231 cells
were ﬁrst treated with ara-211 before cell lysis and
immunoprecipitation of  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 (figure 1d).
as expected, only rki but not  xxxd3462xxx  inhibited  xxxg1924xxx 
kinase, whereas both rki and  xxxd3462xxx  inhibited mek-1
kinase when whole cells were treated. in contrast, to the
effects on  xxxg1924xxx  kinase activity, b- xxxg1924xxx  activity
was not affected upon stimulation of cells with ara211 (data not shown).
because ara-211 inhibits  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinase
activities when intact cells are treated, but not in vitro,
suggested that the target for this compound is upstream
of  xxxg1924xxx  kinase. an acs chemical library search
identiﬁed ara-211 as  xxxd2964xxx , a  xxxg92xxx  agonist. to
demonstrate that ara-211 acts as a  xxxg92xxx  agonist in
mda-mb-231 cells, and that this results in blockade of
the raf/mek/erk pathway, we treated these cells with
ara-211 and ﬁrst showed that this compound induced
the formation of camp (figure 2a). we then determined that ara-211 is highly selective for b2ars by
determining that only b2 but not b1, a1 or a2 receptor
antagonists block the ability of ara-211 to induce
camp formation (figure 2a). furthermore, we used
isopreterenol, a b-speciﬁc ar agonist, and showed that
it also stimulates the formation of camp and decreases
the levels of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (data not shown). finally,
treatment of mda-mb-231 cells with a b1 selective
agonist, dobutamine and a b3 selective agonist, ci316,
243, did not inhibit p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (data not shown).
we then demonstrated that the ability of ara-211 to
disrupt the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway requires its
ability to stimulate the b2 adrenergic pathway by
demonstrating that the  xxxg92xxx  antagonists prevented
ara-211 from suppressing p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (figure 2b).
furthermore, we used the adenylyl cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  to directly induce camp production, and
determined that  xxxd1742xxx  alone can inhibit p- xxxg1369xxx /2 in
mda-mb-231 cells (figure 2c). taken together, these
data demonstrate that ara-211 is a b2-selective ar
agonist that suppresses p- xxxg1369xxx /2 by increasing camp
levels.
figures 1 and 2 demonstrated that ara-211 stimulates the production of camp which, in turn, suppresses
the raf/mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway. we next examined
whether camp suppresses the p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels by
activating pka or by activating the rap1 guanine
exchange factor epac. to this end, we treated mdamb-231 cells either with the epac activator 8-cpt20 -o-me-camp or the pka kinase inhibitor  xxxd477xxx .
figure 3a shows that treatment with the epac activator
did not affect p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels. in contrast, treatment
with the pka inhibitor prevented ara-211 from
suppressing the levels of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (figure 3b). we next

figure 1 identiﬁcation of ara-211, a selective suppressor of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels in mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells. (a) high
throughput screening identiﬁes ara-211. mda-mb-231 cells were plated in 25 96-well plates treated with vehicle (eight wells),
 xxxd1169xxx  (two wells) or 2000 compounds (one compound/well) from the nci diversity set, and the plates processed for
immunocytoblotting with an anti-phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody as described under materials and methods. plate no.23 is shown with wells
treated with vehicle as well as those treated with the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx . (b) ara-211 treatment of mda-mb-231 cells and
western blotting were performed as described under materials and methods and resulted in suppression of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and p- xxxg1361xxx  but
not p-raf, p-jnk, p-p38, p-akt and p-stat3. (c) ara-211 does not inhibit  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinases in vitro.  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 were
immunoprecipitated from mda-mb-231 cells and treated in vitro with ara-211, rki or  xxxd3462xxx  and kinase assays followed by sds–
page were performed as described in materials and methods. (d) ara-211 inhibits  xxxg1924xxx  and mek-1 kinases when intact cells are
treated. similar experiments were performed as in (c) except that the intact cells were ﬁrst treated with the compounds before
immunoprecipitation and kinase assays. all experiments in (b, c and d) are representative of at least three independent experiments.

determined if ara-211 is able to activate pka.
figure 3c shows that ara-211 treatment of mdamb-231 cells activated pka kinase activity and that the
pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  prevented ara-211 from activating pka.
figures 1–3 demonstrated that stimulation of the
 xxxg92xxx  with ara-211 suppresses the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /
2 pathway by a camp-dependent activation of pka but
not epac. we next determined whether activation of
the  xxxg92xxx  and inhibition of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2
pathway results in inhibition of tumor cell growth and

survival of human cancer cells. to this end, we ﬁrst used
a panel of six human cancer cell lines, including three
where ara-211 inhibits p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (mda-mb-231
(breast), sf-539 central nervous system (cns) and
achn (renal)), and three where it did not (a-549
(lung), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hct)116 (colon) and snb-19 (cns)). figure 4a and table 1
show that p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels were suppressed only in the
human cancer cell lines where ara-211 induced camp
production. furthermore, ara-211 potently inhibited
anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, and

figure 2 ara-211 is a selective  xxxg92xxx  agonist that inhibits
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels by increasing camp. mda-mb-231 cells were
treated with ara-211 alone or in the presence of b1, b2, a1 or
 xxxg82xxx  antagonists and the levels of camp (a) and p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (b)
were determined as described under materials and methods. mdamb-231 cells were also treated with the adenylyl cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  and its effects on p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels determined (c). data
are representative of at least three independent experiments.

induced apoptosis in cell lines where it stimulated the
 xxxg92xxx  and inhibited p- xxxg1369xxx /2, but not in cell lines in
which ara-211 did not induce camp and decreased
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (figure 4a and table 1). similar data
were obtained with another b selective ar agonist
isopreterenol (data not shown).  xxxd1742xxx , which
activates adenylyl cyclase directly and produces camp,
inhibited the growth of mda-mb-231 cells (figure 4b),
further demonstrating the importance of camp in
ara-211 inhibition of tumor cell growth. to further
demonstrate that the ability of ara-211 to decrease
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels and to inhibit tumor cell growth requires
stimulation of the  xxxg92xxx , we showed that  xxxg92xxx 
antagonists rescued human cancer cells from ara-211
inhibition of tumor cell growth and suppression of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (figure 4c).
the above data clearly demonstrated that the ability
of ara-211 to disrupt the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway and to inhibit tumor cell growth and survival
depends on its ability to stimulate the  xxxg92xxx  and
produce camp. however, the ability of ara-211 to
inhibit tumor cell growth could be due to its ability
oncogene

to affect cellular events other than those leading to
decreased p- xxxg1369xxx /2. therefore, we next determined
whether the inhibition of tumor cell growth by ara211 requires its ability to inhibit the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /
2 pathway. we reasoned that if suppression of  xxxg1924xxx 
and mek-1 is critical to ara-211 inhibition of tumor
growth, then ectopically expressing constitutively active
mek-1 would rescue human cancer cells from the effects
of ara-211. figure 4d shows that mda-mb-231 cells
that ectopically express constitutively active mek-1 are
resistant to ara-211 inhibition of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and
inhibition of tumor cell growth.
the ability of ara-211 to inhibit tumor cell growth
and induce apoptosis in cultured cells in a  xxxg92xxx  and
mek-1-dependent manner suggested that ara-211
might induce tumor regression in human cancers where
it can block the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway. therefore, we determined the ability of ara-211 to interfere
with the growth and progression of nude mice xenografts of several human cancer cells. figure 5a–e and
table 1 show that ara-211 was only able to suppress
tumor growth in human tumors (mda-mb-231 and
achn) where  xxxg92xxx  stimulation occurs but not in
those (a-549, snb-19 and hct-116) in which it does
not. figure 5a demonstrates that treatment with ara211 (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) of mice bearing established
mda-mb-231 breast tumors under the mammary fat

stimulation of the  xxxg92xxx  results in tumor growth inhibition

in this manuscript, a chemical biology approach was
used to interrogate aberrant signal transduction circuits
in human cancer cells about the importance of the  xxxg92xxx 
in regulating cell division and tumor survival. our
studies clearly demonstrated that activation of the
 xxxg92xxx  by ara-211 results in inhibition of anchoragedependent and -independent tumor cell growth, as well
as induction of apoptosis and tumor regression, in
human tumors where stimulation of the  xxxg92xxx  results
in blockade of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway. the
mechanism by which ara-211 inhibits the  xxxg1924xxx / xxxg1361xxx / xxxg1369xxx /2 involves a camp-dependent pka, but not
epac activation. furthermore, ara-211 inhibition of
tumor cell growth is rescued by  xxxg92xxx  antagonists,
suggesting that growth inhibition requires  xxxg92xxx  signaling. this is consistent with other studies that showed
that  xxxd2398xxx , cholera toxin,  xxxd1742xxx  and 8-bromocamp inhibit dna synthesis and cell growth (veber
et al., 1994; slotkin et al., 2000). increases in camp
levels have also been shown to inhibit mitosis and
mmps expression in mda-mb-231 cells (yu et al.,
1998; slotkin and seidler, 2000).
our studies also demonstrated that constitutively
active mek-1 rescues from ara-211 inhibition of tumor
cell growth, suggesting that ara-211 must inhibit  xxxg1924xxx /
mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 to induce its antitumorigenesis effects.
this is an important ﬁnding as a large number of human
cancers harbor genetic alterations that ultimately result in
hyperactivation of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway.
for example, it is estimated that 30% of all human
cancers contain ras mutations that lead to hyperactivation of this pathway (bos, 1989). similarly, a great
majority of human cancers overexpress or contain
constitutively activated receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and/or growth factor autocrine loops that
also result in hyperactivation of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2.

figure 6 ara-211 suppresses p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels, inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in human xenografts in nude mice.
mda-mb-231 cells were implanted under mammary fat pads and the mice treated with vehicle (’) or ara-211 (j, 75 mpk/day) as
described under figure 5, tumors removed on day 12 and processed for p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (ihc), apoptosis (tunel) and proliferation
(ki-67) as described under materials and methods. pictures represent 1/100 of the total slide area analysed for one of the three samples
per treatment group.

(di marco et al., 1989; fleming et al., 1992; watanabe
et al., 1996; graells et al., 2004). more importantly,
hyperactivation of this pathway is critical to the growth
oncogene

and survival of human tumors (sebolt-leopold et al.,
1999). finally, thwarting this pathway in human cancers
may result in great beneﬁts in the treatment of cancer

patients as the genetic aberrations (i.e., ras mutations,
egf-r and erbb2 over expression) that result in
hyperactivation of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway
have all been associated with poor prognosis, resistance
to therapy and shortened patient life (slamon et al., 1987;
weldon et al., 2002; jin et al., 2003).
using b2 stimulation to cause tumor regression by
blocking the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is a novel
and powerful approach that could have a widespread
use in cancer therapy. indeed, tumors activate
this pathway with a broad spectrum of growth factors/
cytokines and their receptors. for example, many
growth factors such as egf, pdgf, ﬁbroblast growth
factor,  xxxg2413xxx , insulin
growth factor-1, heregulin and others all activate
this pathway (di marco et al., 1989; strobl
et al., 1995; dhillon and kolch, 2002). therefore,
tumors that express two or more of these growth
factors may require a cocktail of anticancer drugs. in
contrast,  xxxg92xxx  stimulation will block activation
of the  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway when it is
driven by several growth factors as they all require
mek to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 (graves et al., 1993; sevetson
et al., 1993; wu et al., 1993; sebolt-leopold, 2000;
dumaz and marais, 2005). for example, we have shown
that growth factor (i.e., egf) stimulation of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 is
blocked by ara-211 in mda-mb-231 cells (data not
shown).
this approach, however, is limited to those human
tumors that express the  xxxg92xxx  and to where the
stimulation of this receptor results in blockade of  xxxg1924xxx /
mek-1/ xxxg1369xxx /2. in normal cells, it has been shown that
adrenergic stimulation can either stimulate or inhibit
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and proliferation (sevetson et al., 1993; maudsley et al., 2000; stork and schmitt, 2002). however, in
tumor cells, it is not known if stimulation of the  xxxg92xxx 
can stimulate tumorigenesis. in some normal cells
expressing b-raf, b2ars stimulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 by activating
b-raf which, in turn, activates mek-1 (erhardt et al.,
1995; vossler et al., 1997) whereas in other normal cells,
b2ars inactivate  xxxg1369xxx /2 by blocking  xxxg1924xxx  (hafner
et al., 1994; schmitt and stork, 2001, 2002; tortora and
ciardiello, 2002). therefore, b2ars may also inhibit or
stimulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 and proliferation in tumors, and this
may depend on the expression levels of not only the
 xxxg92xxx  but also  xxxg1924xxx  and/or b-raf.
to translate these important results to clinically
relevant ﬁndings, fresh human tumor biopsies should
be used to determine the effects of  xxxg92xxx  stimulation on
p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels in  xxxg92xxx -expressing tumors as well as to
determine if the ability of  xxxg92xxx  stimulation to inhibit
proliferation and induce apoptosis depends on the ratio
of c-raf to b-raf expression. the fact that ara-211
( xxxd2964xxx ) has previously been used orally and locally
(steen et al., 1974; moore et al., 1978; grassi et al.,
1986) in humans to evaluate its potential as an antiasthmatic and as treatment for congestive heart failure
will facilitate its testing as an anticancer drug in a
hypothesis-driven clinical trial with patients where
 xxxg92xxx  stimulation is predicted to block  xxxg1924xxx /mek-1/
 xxxg1369xxx /2.

materials and methods
cell lines and transfections
all cell lines used were obtained from american type tissue
collection (manassas, va, usa), or from the dctd tumor
repository (frederick, md, usa). dna transfections were
carried out using transit-lt1 transfection reagent (takara
mirus, madison, wi, usa) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. brieﬂy, lt1 was preincubated in 200 ml in optimem (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) before addition of
plasmid (2 mg of pfc-mekk plasmid, stratagene, la jolla,
ca, usa). the mixture was then added to 4  105 mda-mb231 cells grown to approximately 70% conﬂuency and
incubated at 371c for 48 h. at that time, cells were treated
with either  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) or ara-211 (10 mm)
for 48 h and assayed for proliferation via alamar blue and
western blot analysis as described below.
cytoblot screening for small molecules that decrease
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2
mda-mb-231 cells (25 000 cells/well) were plated into sterile,
white opaque, 96-well plates, allowed to attach overnight, and
treated for 1 h in the presence of either vehicle control, 20 mm
 xxxd1169xxx  (emd biosciences), or 10 mm of nci diversity set
of 2000 compounds (one compound/well) (http://dtp.nci.nih.
gov/) as described by us (blaskovich et al., 2003). cells were
washed, ﬁxed, permeabilized, re-washed and rocked overnight
at 41c with anti-phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk and anti-rabbit igg
secondary antibody. the plates were washed and chemiluminescence reagent added, and the x-ray ﬁlm was then directly
placed on top of the plates.
western blotting
this was carried out exactly as described previously by us
(blaskovich et al., 2003). the following antibodies were used:
phospho-stat3, phospho-akt, phospho-c-raf, phosphomek and phospho- xxxd1355xxx /p42 mapk antibodies (cell signaling
technology, danvers, ma, usa). cells treated with ara211, 8cpt-20 -o-me-camp,  xxxd477xxx  and  xxxd1742xxx  to determine
their effects on p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and other signaling events by western
blot were treated for 1 h at varying doses. pretreatment with
 xxxd477xxx  was performed for 15 min followed by 45 min of ara-211
treatment.
in vitro kinase assays
mda-mb-231 cells (2  106) were lysed for 30 min at 41c in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ripa)-150 buffer (10 mm
tris ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm ethylene
diamine tetracetic acid (edta), 1% triton x-100, 1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm
aprotinin, 10 mm leupeptin, 10 mm antipain). the lysates were
rocked overnight with 10 mg of either c-raf or mek
antibodies (santa cruz biotechnologies, santa cruz, ca,
usa). a portion of 25 ml of protein a/g plus agarose beads
(santa cruz biotechnology) was then added and rocked for 4 h
at 41c. beads were resuspended in 30 ml kinase buffer (30 mm
n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n0 -2-ethanesulphonic acid, ph
7.5, 7 mm mncl2, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and
15 mm  xxxd83xxx  (atp) with either 10 mm  xxxd3462xxx  (emd biosciences) ara-211,  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitor
(emd biosciences) or dmso vehicle control. a portion of
0.5 mg mek-1 or  xxxg1366xxx  peptide substrate (upstate biotechnologies, lake placid, ny, usa) was added, followed by
20 mci [g-32p]-atp. samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction terminated by the addition of 30 ml

in vivo kinase assay
intact mda-mb-231 cells (2  106) were treated either with
vehicle control (dmso), 10 mm  xxxd3462xxx , 10 mm  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibitor or 10 mm ara-211. samples were then processed for
kinase assays as described above.
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
thiazolyl blue assay
assays were carried out exactly as described previously by us
(sebti et al., 1991).
alamar blue proliferation assay
for proliferation assays using exogenous constitutively activated mek or the  xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici-118.551, alamar
blue metabolism assay was used to determine cell viability
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (biosource, camarillo, ca, usa). brieﬂy, cells were treated and grown as
described above; alamar blue was added to the media at a 1:10
dilution and incubated for 3 h. media/alamar blue was
removed from the cells and aliquoted into 96-well plates
(100 ml per well), and ﬂuorescence read on a wallac victor 2
plate reader at excitation 540 nm and emission 615 nm.
soft agar assay
anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as
described previously (lerner et al., 1997).
apoptosis assay
cells (1  105) were plated in 60 mm dishes and treated with
various doses of ara-211 or vehicle for 48 h. apoptosis was
analysed using the cell death detection elisa (roche,
indianapolis, in, usa) measuring cytoplasmic histoneassociated mono- and oligonucleosome dna fragments.
total cellular camp measurement
two thousand cells were plated into each well of a 96-well
plate. the next day cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of ara-211 or with vehicle for 1 h. alternatively, mda-mb-231 cells were pretreated with antagonists
to the a1 ( xxxd3000xxx , sigma), a2 (yohimbine, sigma), b1
(metoprolol, sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo, usa), and b2
(ici 118.551, sigma) ars at 100 nm for 15 min followed by
treatment with 10 mm ara-211 for 45 min. the measurement
of total cellular camp was carried out using a camp biotrak
enzyme immuno assay system (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

pka kinase assay
cells were plated (5  106) into 100 mm dishes and treated the
next day with ara-211,  xxxd477xxx  (emd biosciences) or vehicle
for 1 h. when pretreating cells,  xxxd477xxx  was incubated for 15 min
following ara-211 treatment for 45 min. pka kinase assays
were performed with the signatect camp-dependent pka
assay system (promega, madison, wi, usa), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.
antitumor activity in nude mouse xenograft model
female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, 5–6 weeks old, were
purchased from charles river (wilmington, ma, usa) and
allowed to acclimate in the animal facility for 1 week. after
harvesting, a-549, snb-19, achn and hct-116 cells were
resuspended in sterile pbs and injected subcutaneously (s.c.)
into the right and left ﬂanks (10  106 cells per ﬂank) of the
mice as described previously (sun et al., 2005). for mda-mb231, cells were harvested and resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) (10  106 cells per 50 ml) and an equal
volume of matrigel (bd biosciences, san jose, ca, usa).
mda-mb-231 (100 ml) cells in pbs/matrigel were injected s.c.
into the mammary fat pads between the second and third
nipples on each side of the mice. once the tumors reached
approximately 200–300 mm3, the mice were randomized and
treated i.p. with 0.1 ml vehicle (pbs) or ara-211. each
treatment group consisted of ﬁve mice (two tumors per mouse,
a total of 10 tumors). the tumor volumes were determined by
measuring the length (l) and width (w), and by calculating the
volume (v ¼ w2l/2). statistical signiﬁcance between the control
and treated animals was determined using a student’s t-test.
ihc and slide quantitation
mice were euthanized and the tumors were ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin. three tumors per treatment group were
then prepared and stained for proliferation marker ki-67,
apoptosis by tunel and phosphor- xxxg1369xxx /2 as described
previously (sun et al., 2003). the ariol sl-50 automated
image analysis system (applied imaging, santa clara, ca,
usa) was used for quantitation of each slide, as described
previously (jiang et al., 2004). each slide analysed consisted of
54 000–160 000 cells analysed depending on the size of the
tumor when resected. signiﬁcance of the quantitation was
analysed by a two-tailed student’s t-test.
