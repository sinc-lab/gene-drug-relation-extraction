we characterized the pharmacological p~-ofiles of the human mineralocorticoid and  xxxg1601xxx  for 11 natural and
synthetic steroids regarding binding pharmacology, intracellular localization of hormone-receptor complexes, and agonistic or
antagonistic properties at the gene expression level. the sex steroid progesterone bound with an affinity (k i < 0.01 nm) even
higher than that of aldosterone to the human  xxxg1602xxx  and effectively antagonized the effect of aldosterone via
the human  xxxg1602xxx  in functional co-transfection assays. this indicates that progesterone has potent
antimineralocorticoid properties, while its antiglucocorticoid effects were less pronounced. the partial agonistic activities of
antihormones in this assay suggest a direct interaction of antihormone-receptor complexes with the response elements on the
dna. these results are supported by immunofluorescence studies, in which both unliganded human mineralocorticoid and
glucocorticoid receptors were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas agonist- as well as antagonist-receptor
complexes showed an exclusively nuclear localization. these results contribute to the understanding of antihormone pharmacology and increase our understanding of the role of human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in physiological
processes during different endocrine states.

introduction

adrenal steroid hormones are of major importance
for maintaining cellular and humoral homeostasis (mcewen et al., 1986; funder and sheppard, 1987; de
kloet, 1991). these hormones exert their actions via
intracellular receptor proteins which act as ligand-dependent transcription factors in the regulation of gene
expression (evans, 1988).
the inactive form of corticosteroid receptors exists
as a heteromeric complex (baulieu, 1987; binart et al.,
1991; alnemri et al., 1991), mainly associated with
heat-shock proteins. the first step in steroid hormone
action is binding to this receptor complex, leading to a
conformational change and dissociation of the receptor
from the inhibitory heterooligomeric structure. subsequent steps such as nuclear translocation and dimerization enable the hormone-receptor complex to bind to
hormone response elements in the regulatory region of
target gene promoters (beato, 1989). the hormone-in-

duced conformational changes also reveal receptor domains that permit protein-protein interactions between
the receptor and the transcription apparatus, thereby
modulating gene expression (beato, 1989).
molecular cloning of the cdnas for both corticosteroid receptors (hollenberg et al., 1985; arriza et al.,
1987) enabled the structural and functional characterization of the human  xxxg1601xxx  (gigu~re
et al., 1986; hollenberg and evans, 1988) and the
human  xxxg1602xxx  (binart et al., 1991;
alnemri et al., 1991; rupprecht et al., 1993). both
receptors consist of three functional domains, the
carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain, the central
dna-binding domain and the amino terminus (evans,
1988; evans and arriza, 1989). the latter part varies in
size and displays no sequence conservation between
the two types of corticosteroid receptors (arriza et al.,
1987; evans and arriza, 1988). this difference seems
to be a critical determinant for the efficiency in stimulating gene expression by the human mineralocorticoid
and human  xxxg1601xxx  (hollenberg et al.,
1985; arriza et al., 1987, 1988; rupprecht et al. 1993).
because of the great similarity in the dna-binding

146

their activity are still unclear. even less is known about
how antagonists interfere with the hormonal response.
it may be that they are unable to promote one or more
critical steps necessary for the receptor to act as a
transcription factor.
while the pharmacology of corticosteroid receptors
has been rather extensively studied in rodents, no
comparable data are available for human receptors. to
characterize the pharmacological properties of the human mineralocorticoid and the human glucocorticoid
receptor, we used receptor cdnas and the possibility
of expressing these proteins in heterologous cell systems. we obtained competition binding data regarding
11 natural and synthetic steroids for both receptors
expressed in cos-1 cells and determined the intracellular localization of ligand-receptor complexes by im-

domains, the human glucocorticoid and  xxxg1602xxx  can interact with the same or closely
related target dna sequences and may regulate overlapping sets of genes (evans and arriza 1989; arriza et
al., 1988).
as a result of considerable sequence homology in
the ligand-binding domain (57% identity), both the
human glucocorticoid and  xxxg1602xxx 
respond to physiological corticosteroids as well as synthetic derivatives (arriza et al., 1987; arriza et al.
1988). in addition, the ligand-binding domain contains
sequences responsible for heat-shock protein interactions, nuclear translocation, dimerization and transactivation (hollenberg and evans, 1988). although most
of these properties appear to be ligand-dependent, the
exact molecular mechanisms by which hormones exert

sk-n-mc cells (human neuroblastoma) were grown
in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium ( d m e m ) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. transfections
were performed using an electroporation system (biotechnologies & experimental research, san diego,
ca) after determination of the optimal electric field
strength (chu et al., 1987). 2.5 /xg reporter gene
(mtv-luc), 5 /zg receptor expression vector and 2.5
/xg carrier d n a (pgem4) (promega corporation,
madison, w i ) w e r e co-transfected with 5 /xg p c h l l 0
(pharmacia lkb, freiburg, germany), an sv40 promoter-driven /3-galactosidase expression vector. electroporated cells were replated in d m e m supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped steroid-free fetal
calf serum (arriza et al., 1987) and incubated immediately with various concentrations of hormones (rupprecht et al. 1993) as indicated in fig. 3. after 24 h,
cells were harvested and extracts were assayed for
luciferase (arriza et al., 1988; de wet et al., 1987) and
/3-galactosidase (herbomel et al., 1984) activity. 10 izl
cell extract and 25 /zl o-nitrophenyl-/3-d-galactopyranoside dissolved at a concentration of 2 m g / m l were
added to 100 /zl assay buffer containing 60 m m
na2hpo4, 40 m m n a h 2 p o 4, 10 m m kc1, 1 m m

incubation at 37°c the reaction was stopped by adding
50 izl 1 m na2co 3. the optical density ranged from
0.1 to 0.8 at 410 nm. to standardize for transfection
efficiency, the relative light units obtained in the luciferase assay were divided by the optical density obtained in the/3-galactosidase assay. for determination
of hormone-binding parameters and for immunofluorescence studies, cos-1 cells (monkey kidney) were
grown and transfected by electroporation with 5 /.~g

fig. 3. trans-activation properties obtained in the co-transfection
assay for the human mineralocorticoid and human glucocorticoid
receptor in response to dexamethasone. individual plates of sk-nmc cells co-transfected with mtv-luc and either human  xxxg1602xxx  (e) (linear ordinate) or human glucocorticoid
receptor (11) (logarithmic ordinate) expression plasmid were incubated with the indicated hormone concentrations. the induction of
the mtv-promoter was calculated from the relative light units
measured in the individual cell extracts and standardized for transfection efficiency by dividing the relative light units by the optical
density obtained in the/3-galactosidase assay. the baseline activityof
the mtv promoter without addition of hormone, equivalent to
approximately 2000 rlu, was set at 1. results are presented as the
mean + s.d. of three to six independent experiments. similar dose
response curves were obtained for all steroids investigated. the
results are summarized in figs. 4 and 5.

and h g r n x (gigubre et al., 1987) were described
previously. to enable an exchange of functional domains between the human glucocorticoid and  xxxg1602xxx , m r nx, a construct analogous to
grnx, was created. a noti site flanking the d n a binding domain was introduced in the human  xxxg1602xxx  c d n a by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, resulting in the replacement of
ser-600 by pro. similarly, the introduction of a flanking
xhoi restriction site led to substitution of gly-671 by
glu (rupprecht et al., 1993). the hybrid receptor
g m m was constructed by exchange of the kpni-xhoi
fragments of r s h g r n x and rshmrnx (rupprecht et
al., 1993).

2.2. cell homogenization, cytosol preparation and assessment of steroid binding parameters of human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors
pellets of transfected cos-1 ceils were homogenized by 10 strokes at 900 rpm in ice-cold 5 m m
tris-hc1 (ph 7.4) containing 0.5 m m phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 i z g / m l antipain, 5 i z g / m l leupeptin,
5% glycerol, 10 mm  xxxd3216xxx , 1 m m e d t a
and 2 m m 13- xxxd26xxx  using a glass homogenizer with a teflon pestle milled at a clearance of 0.25

149
mm on the radius. the homogenate was centrifuged
(100,000 × g, 0-2°c) for 60 rain to obtain cytosol. the
cytosol was incubated in a total volume of 150 /xl in
duplicate, either with 3-5 nm [3h]aldosterone (87-94
ci/mmol, nen dupont, dreieich, germany) or 2-5
nm [3h]progesterone (153 ci/mmol, nen dupont,
dreieich, germany) to label the human  xxxg1602xxx  or with 3-5 nm [3h]dexamethasone (85106 ci/mmol, amersham, braunschweig, germany) to
label the human  xxxg1601xxx . unlabeled
steroids were included in these incubations to compete
for receptor binding. aldosterone, cortisol, dexamethasone, ru 28362,  xxxd2643xxx  (roussel uclaf, romainville, france), spironolactone, 9a-fluorocortisol,
deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (5a-pregnan-3a-21-diol-20-one; sigma,
deisenhofen, germany) and allotetrahydroprogesterone (5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one; sigma) served as
competitors. the concentrations used for displacement
were 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 nm. after incubation for 20-24 h at 0°c, bound and free 3h-steroid
were separated by sephadex lh-20 (pharmacia, sweden) gel filtration, radioactivity was measured in a
liquid scintillation counter and protein content was
determined by the method of lowry (lowry et al.,
1951) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as a standard.
data are expressed as 3h-steroid receptor binding in
moles per liter (m).
apart from displacement binding analysis, a typical
experiment also consisted of saturation binding of
[3h]aldosterone, [3h]progesterone and [3h]dexamethasone (0.1-15 nm) to determine by scatchard analysis
the k d values of the respective 3h-ligands for human
corticosteroid receptors. the parameter k d was required to calculate the inhibition constant (k i) by a
combined method of hill plot analysis and the chengprusoff equation (cheng and prusoff, 1973). slope
index and k~ were calculated by fitting the experimental data to the expected linear relationship log[(b0/b)
- 1][([3h]/kd3h) + 1] = log[i] - log(ki) , in which b 0
represents the specific binding in the absence and b
the specific binding in the presence of unlabeled competitor. [3h] is the concentration of 3h-ligand. kd3h is
the dissociation constant (apparent affinity constant) of
the 3h-ligand, which was determined by scatchard
analysis, as described earlier, in a parallel experiment.
[i] is the concentration of the unlabeled competitor.

2.3. immunolabeling of transfected cos-1 cells
after transfection with the respective human mineralocorticoid or  xxxg1601xxx  expression vector, cells were cultured in dmem containing 10%
charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 20-24 h in the
presence or absence of hormone in coverslips on 25-well
polystyrene plates (greiner, alphen a / d rijn, nether-

lands). coverslips were pretreated with 1 m g / m l a1cian blue 8 gx (sigma) and sterilized with ethanol.
cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs; ph 7.4) and fixed by adding 2% formaldehyde in pbs to the coverslips. after incubation for 10
min, cells were washed twice with pbs and made
permeable with 0.5% nonidet p-40 (usb, cleveland,
ohio) in pbs for 10 min, followed by two brief washing
steps. then cells were incubated as follows: 5 min with
100 mm glycine in pbs to block free aldehyde groups;
two times 15 min with 0.5% bsa/0.2% gelatin (sigma)
in pbs (pbg); 1 h or overnight with the rabbit antiserum minrec2 (krozowski et al., 1989) against the
human  xxxg1602xxx , diluted 1:500 in
pbg, or with the rabbit polyclonal antibody 59 against
the human  xxxg1601xxx  (affinity bioreagents, neshanic station, n j) (cidlowski et al., 1990) at
a concentration of 5 / x g / m l in pbg. after six washing
steps cells were incubated for 5 min in pbg and 1 h
with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (nordic, breda, netherlands) diluted
1 : 200 in pbg followed by four washing steps in pbg
and four washing steps in pbs. labeled samples were
mounted with 90% glycerol in pbs containing 1 m g / m l
p-phenylenediaminine (sigma) to prevent bleaching
(johnson and nogueira araujo, 1981) and photographed on kodak tri-x films at 400 asa using a
zeiss axiophot microscope with a planapo 63/1.25
phase-contrast objective. immunofluorescence studies
were performed as three independent blind experiments.

results

3.1. binding characteristics of recombinant human m&eralocorticoid receptor and human  xxxg1601xxx 
for the characterization of hormone binding profiles, human mineralocorticoid or  xxxg1601xxx  expression vectors were introduced into cos-1
cells, resulting in a high-level expression of the receptor molecules. labeling of cytosolic extracts with
[3h]aldosterone for cells expressing the human  xxxg1602xxx  or [3h]dexamethasone for cells
expressing the human  xxxg1601xxx  revealed
approximately 2000 fmol receptor/mg protein.
to obtain precise k i values for human mineralocorticoid and  xxxg1601xxx  binding parameters,
displacement curves for a series of steroids were obtained. the mineralocorticoids aldosterone (k i = 0.09
nm) (fig. 1) and deoxycorticosterone (k i < 0.01 nm)
and the glucocorticoids cortisol (ki=0.13 nm) and
dexamethasone (k i = 1.1 nm) (fig. 1a) revealed a high
affinity by competing effectively for [3h]aldosterone

150

binding. progesterone binds to the human  xxxg1602xxx  with an affinity even higher than that of
aldosterone (k i < 0.01 nm). the same results were
obtained when using [3h]progesterone (fig. 1c) instead
of [3h]aldosterone to label the human  xxxg1602xxx  (k i = 0.08 nm for aldosterone; k i < 0.01
nm for progesterone). in contrast, the antimineralocorticoid spironolactone displays a lower affinity (k i = 5.7
nm), while the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist ru
38486 shows no significant binding to the human  xxxg1602xxx  (fig. 1a).
parallel experiments using cell extracts containing
the human  xxxg1601xxx  demonstrate high
affinity binding of the synthetic glucocorticoids ru
28362 (k i = 0.4 nm) and dexamethasone (k i = 1.1 nm)
as well as of the antagonist  xxxd2643xxx  (k i = 2.2 nm),
whereas mineralocorticoid agonists and antagonists
show only a weak binding to the human glucocorticoid
receptor (k i = 40 nm for deoxycorticosterone, k~ = 63
nm for aldosterone, k~ = 79 nm for spironolactone)
(fig. 1b). a noteworthy feature is that cortisol, the
main glucocorticoid in man, has a lower affinity for the
human  xxxg1601xxx  (k i = 15 nm) than for
the human  xxxg1602xxx  (k i = 0.13 nm).
moreover, the affinity of progesterone differs by several orders of magnitude between the human  xxxg1602xxx  (k i < 0.01 nm) and the human  xxxg1601xxx  (k~ = 16 nm).

3.2. intracellular localization of human  xxxg1602xxx  and human  xxxg1601xxx   xxxg1603xxx  complexes
the cos-cell expression system was also employed
to compare the intracellular localization of unliganded,

agonist- and antagonist-bound receptor complexes by
immunofluorescence.
in the absence of steroid hormone, cytoplasmic and
nuclear staining can be observed for the human  xxxg1601xxx . (fig. 2a). the human mineralocorticold receptor shows only a weak staining in the absence of hormone (fig. 2e). the addition of an agonist
(dexamethasone for the human  xxxg1601xxx , aldosterone for the human  xxxg1602xxx ) to the culture medium leads to an exclusively
nuclear staining of both receptors (fig. 2b,f). a similar
increase in nuclear staining can be observed after incubation of the transfected cells with the antiglucocortiocid r u 38486 (fig. 2c) or the antimineralocorticoid
spironolactone (fig. 2g). treatment of the cells with
progesterone also results in a complete nuclear localization of the human mineralocortiocid receptor (fig.
2h). human  xxxg1601xxx  expressing cells
incubated with progesterone show a predominantly
nuclear staining but retain diffuse staining of the cytoplasm in some cells. (fig. 2d).

3.3. functional properties of human mineralocorticoid
and human  xxxg1601xxx  ligands
the agonistic properties of the steroid ligands used
in the binding assays were determined by assessing the
potency of the steroids to induce transcription from the
hormone-responsive mtv promoter. human mineralocorticoid or  xxxg1601xxx  expression vectors
were co-transfected with the mtv-luc reporter gene
in the human neuroblastoma cell line sk-n-mc. in
this system, the agonistic activity of steroid ligands is
proportional to the induction of the mtv promoter as
measured by the extent of luciferase production in the
fold induc~on

cells. using both corticosteroid receptors we obtained
dose response curves for all the steroids investigated.
an example using the synthetic common ligand dexamethasone is given in fig. 3. fig. 4 shows the maximal
response values obtained in this system with the different steroid ligands, and in fig. 5 the eds0 values, which
reflect the functional sensitivity, derived from the dose
response curves are plotted against the k i values obtained in the binding assay.
whereas cortisol and the synthetic compounds dexamethasone, ru 28362 and 9a-fluorocortisol induce a
strong activation of the human  xxxg1601xxx ,
the mineralocorticoids aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone are much less active.  xxxd2643xxx  and progesterone display only a weak agonistic activity, and
spironolactone induces no stimulation of the mtv
promoter via the human  xxxg1601xxx . the
metabolites tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone and allotetrahydroprogesterone, which do not bind to the human
 xxxg1601xxx , do not exert any effect on the
transcription rate of the mtv promoter. in contrast to
their effects on the human  xxxg1601xxx ,
both mineralocorticoids (aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone) and glucocorticoids (cortisol, dexamethasone)
show a clear agonistic activity via the human  xxxg1602xxx . tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3.8fold induction) and progesterone (2.2-fold induction)
display only a weak partial agonistic activity, whereas
ru 28362,  xxxd2643xxx , spironolactone and allotetrahydroprogesterone are completely inactive as inducers of
transcription (fig. 4).
a comparison of binding affinities and the eds0
values obtained in the co-transfection assay revealed
good agreement between both parameters when the
various compounds were assayed with the human  xxxg1601xxx  (fig. 5). the eds0 of the antiglucocorticoid  xxxd2643xxx  is in the range of hgr agonists,

3.4. antagonistic actiuity of steroid ligands
the putative antagonism of steroids at the level of
gene expression was verified in functional competition
experiments. a 1000-fold excess of  xxxd2643xxx  decreases the human  xxxg1601xxx  response to
1 nm ru 28362 to approximately 10%, and progesterone and spironolactone reduce this activity to 45%
and 60%, respectively (data not shown).
using the human  xxxg1602xxx , the
addition of 1 nm progesterone resulted in an almost
complete reduction of the aldosterone-induced human

and progesterone also has an eds0 value comparable
to mineralocorticoids. however, these two compounds
induce only a low transcriptional response (fig. 4),
suggesting that despite their partial agonistic activity
they may be antagonists in vivo. in contrast, spironolactone fails to induce detectable transcriptional activity
(figs. 4 and 5) and therefore may function as an
antiglucocorticoid devoid of any partial agonistic activity besides its well documented antimineralocorticoid
properties.
with regard to the human  xxxg1602xxx , however, the binding affinity and the eds0 values
required for biological activity are significantly different for several ligands. for example, aldosterone shows
a higher functional sensitivity for the human  xxxg1602xxx  than deoxycorticosterone (higher affinity) or cortisol (similar affinity). moreover, the very
high binding affinity of the human mineralocorticoid
receptor for progesterone (k i < 0.0l nm) in combination with the very low agonistic activity indicates that
progesterone may act as a potent human  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist that is even more effective
than spironolactone (k~ = 5.7 nm), which displays no
partial agonistic activity (fig. 4).

fig. 6. competition of minera]ocorticoid action by spironolactone
(©) and progesterone (e) in the co-transfection assay using the
gmm expression plasmid. the value obtained with 1 nm aldosterone without competitor was set as 100%. results are expressed in
terms of% activity following co-incubation of 1 nm aldosterone and
increasing doses of competitor as indicated and represent the mean

 xxxg1602xxx  mediated response (data not
shown). because of the low trans-activation potential
of the human  xxxg1602xxx  the antagonistic properties of spironolactone and progesterone
were assayed again in detail using a chimeric receptor
gmm, which contains the dna-and ligand binding
domain of the human  xxxg1602xxx  fused
to the amino terminus of the human glucocorticoid
receptor containing a strong trans-activation domain.
spironolactone significantly reduces the aldosteroneinduced response of gmm in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibition at 100 nm (ics0) but progesterone is even more effective as an aldosterone antagonist with an ics0 value of 2-3 nm (fig. 6).

discussion

while only few data exist on the pharmacology of
human corticosteroid receptors, a number of studies
have investigated the binding specificity and affinity of
these receptors for naturally occurring ligands in rodents (reul and de kloet, 1985; luttge et al., 1989;
veldhuis et al., 1982; krozowski and funder, 1983;
sutanto and de kloet, 1987). the mineralocorticoid
receptor of rat (reul and de kloet, 1985) and mouse
(luttge et al., 1989) displays a high affinity for aldosterone and corticosterone, the principal glucocorticoid

in these species, but a lower affinity for cortisol, the
main glucocorticoid in man. in the dog, which like
humans uses cortisol as the principal glucocorticoid,
cortisol binds to both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors with considerable affinity (reul et al.,
1990). however, dexamethasone does not exhibit a
high affinity for the canine  xxxg1601xxx 
(reul et al., 1990). there appears to be considerable
variation between mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid
binding specificity and affinity, which renders an extrapolation of pharmacological data across various
species questionable.
therefore, we assessed binding affinities of human
receptor ligands and determined the functional consequences of ligand-receptor interactions on gene expression using recombinant corticosteroid receptors together with a reconstitution of hormone-dependent
gene regulation in heterologous cell lines.
although clinical and pharmacological studies have
already predicted a physiological role of progesterone
as a human  xxxg1602xxx  (landau et al.,
1965) and human  xxxg1601xxx  (rousseau et
al., 1972) antagonist, we show here that progesterone
appears to be a preferential ligand of the human
 xxxg1602xxx . earlier investigations reported an apparently lower affinity of the human  xxxg1602xxx  for progesterone (arriza et al.,
1987). however, they used only a 2.5 h incubation
period during the binding assay (arriza et al., 1987),
which may not represent steady state conditions. we
determined the affinity of the human mineralocorticoid
receptor for progesterone by displacement analysis of
both [3h]aldosterone-labeled and [3h]progesteronelabeled recombinant human  xxxg1602xxx 
under equilibrium conditions (reul et al., 1990). the
affinity of progesterone for the human  xxxg1602xxx  is even higher than that of aldosterone
and for the human  xxxg1601xxx  comparable
to that of cortisol, which suggests a physiological role
of progesterone in the regulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical system via both the human
 xxxg1602xxx  and the human  xxxg1601xxx . at present, no data are available concerning the effects of progesterone on the activity of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system in
man. however, in the co-transfection system, progesterone displayed only a weak partial agonistic activity.
increasing doses of progesterone almost completely
abolished the aldosterone-induced response of the
mtv promoter mediated by the human  xxxg1602xxx  or its derivative gmm, suggesting that
progesterone can act as an antimineralocorticoid that
is even more potent than spironolactone. as observed
in a fibroblast cell line (couette et al., 1992), the
transcriptional activity of the ru 28362-stimulated human  xxxg1601xxx  is only partially antago-

153

nized by progesterone, indicating that its antiglucocorticoid activity is less pronounced.
although the regulation of gene expression by
steroid receptors requires a cascade of various steps
such as hormone binding, dissociation from the  xxxg1098xxx 
complex, dimerization and dna binding (beato, 1989),
which in combination result in the final transcriptional
reponse, the binding profiles of the human  xxxg1601xxx  and the human  xxxg1602xxx  expressed in cos-1 cells generally were consistent
with the relative potency of the compounds as inducers
of human  xxxg1602xxx - or human  xxxg1601xxx -dependent gene transcription. some
compounds, however, display a differential ability in
trans-activation potency and radioligand displacement.
as previously observed in a kidney cell line (arriza et
al., 1988), aldosterone shows a lower eds0 than deoxycorticosterone or cortisol, which display a 10-fold lower
or a similar k i value, respectively. similar variations
are observed with the human  xxxg1601xxx .
the maximal transcriptional activation in response to
 xxxd2643xxx  and progesterone is only a fraction of that
obtained with dexamethasone or ru 28362, suggesting
that binding of  xxxd2643xxx  or progesterone does not
expose the full trans-activation functions of the human
 xxxg1601xxx . however, the eds0 and k i
values for  xxxd2643xxx  are in the range of human  xxxg1601xxx  agonists, while progesterone shows
values similar to mineralocorticoids.
despite the low partial agonistic activity of ru
38486-human  xxxg1601xxx , progesteronehuman  xxxg1601xxx  and progesterone-human  xxxg1602xxx  complexes, an interaction with the cognate response elements is required,
which argues against a role of these two "antihormones" as stabilizators of cytoplasmic receptor-heat
shock protein 90 complexes (baulieu, 1987; groyer et
al., 1987; distelhorst and howard, 1990; formstecher
et al., 1988; segnitz and gehring, 1990). they rather
appear to interfere with transcriptional activation by
agonists at later steps, possibly by inducing a different
structure of the ligand-binding domain (meyer et al.,
1990; vegeto et al., 1992). these data are supported by
studies in which  xxxd2643xxx - xxxg1601xxx  or
 xxxd2643xxx - xxxg1737xxx  complexes have been
found to bind dna in vitro (meyer et al., 1990; guiochon-mantel et al. 1988).
in support of this view are our data on the intracellular localization of agonist- and antagonist-bound receptor complexes. in the absence of hormone, cells
expressing the human  xxxg1601xxx  display a
clear staining of both nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas
ceils transfected with the human  xxxg1602xxx  show only a weak staining. possibly, in the
absence of hormone the human  xxxg1602xxx  is not very well recognized by the antiserum.

alternatively, the unliganded human mineralocorticoid
receptor may be extracted from the cells during the
fixation procedure. however, after agonist exposure
both the human  xxxg1602xxx  and human
 xxxg1601xxx  display an exclusively nuclear
staining. these observations are consistent with previous reports using other cell lines (binart et al., 1991;
alnemri et al., 1991; krozowski et al., 1989; cidlowski
et al., 1990; antakly et al., 1989). however, progesterone-human  xxxg1602xxx  complexes,
spironolactone-human  xxxg1602xxx  complexes and  xxxd2643xxx -human  xxxg1601xxx 
complexes also show an exclusively nuclear localization, indistinguishable from that of agonist-receptor
complexes. the partial cytoplasmic staining of progesterone-human  xxxg1601xxx  complexes may
be explained by the lower affinity of the human  xxxg1601xxx  for progesterone. the subcellular
localization of unliganded steroid receptors appears to
be affected by the histochemical methods employed,
and studies using other fixation methods and confocal
microscopy techniques (brink et al., 1992; martins et
al., 1992) have suggested a predominantly nuclear localization also of unliganded  xxxg1601xxx .
nevertheless, with the fixation method used in the
present study, we can distinguish between liganded and
unliganded receptor at least with regard to stability of
nuclear localization and can clearly show that antihormone-receptor complexes display an intracellular distribution similar to that of agonist-receptor complexes.
in the present study we provide an accurate assessment of pharmacological and functional properties of
human corticosteroid receptor ligands by the use of
recombinant receptors. this approach identified progesterone as a potent human  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist and may contribute to the development
of new pharmacological compounds.
