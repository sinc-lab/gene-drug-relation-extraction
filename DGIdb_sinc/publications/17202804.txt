abstract
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) analogs constitute the most widely employed medical treatment for prostatic cancer. the predominant mechanism of action is presumed to be via the inhibition of gonadotropins and resultant
decrease in  xxxd3327xxx . however, gnrh analogs have also
been shown to directly inhibit prostate cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo through antiproliferative cell cycle arrest
and stimulation of apoptosis. since the  xxxg931xxx  has
been shown to affect sex steroid  xxxg1603xxx  function, we considered that part of gnrh analog actions on
prostate cells may be mediated through modulation of the
human  xxxg183xxx . using a model hek293 cell line
expressing the  xxxg931xxx , we demonstrated a novel signalling pathway of the  xxxg931xxx  that induces nuclear
translocation of the  xxxg183xxx  that renders it transcriptionally inactive. this mechanism involves the calciumdependent  xxxg2198xxx   xxxg1890xxx , the non-receptor tyrosine

kinase  xxxg2198xxx  and the focal adhesion protein/steroid receptor
co-factor, hic-5. in this setting there is a gnrh-induced association and nuclear translocation of the  xxxg183xxx  with hic-5. gnrh-induced  xxxg1890xxx  activation opposed the
association of hic-5 with  xxxg183xxx  as overexpression of a dominant negative  xxxg1890xxx  enhanced the gnrh-induced nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent proteintagged human  xxxg183xxx . gnrh-induced  xxxg2198xxx 
activation resulted in the phosphorylation of expressed hic5 and promoted its association with the human  xxxd3327xxx 
receptor. in contrast to testosterone, gnrh-induced nuclear
translocation did not transcriptionally activate the  xxxd3327xxx 
receptor. we then demonstrated that gnrh can also stimulate  xxxg183xxx  mobilization in human prostate  xxxg1682xxx ,
bph-1 and lncap cells, and in cultured rat ventral prostate
cells through the same mechanism. to determine if gnrh
could antagonize  xxxd3327xxx  effects in normal tissue, we examined the effect of gnrh on rat ventral prostate organ cultures and demonstrated that gnrh can functionally antagonize the actions of testosterone on prostate cell proliferation
and tissue growth. this antagonism of testosterone action
by gnrh may underlie in part the capacity of  xxxg931xxx 
activation to inhibit prostate tumor growth.

a

 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) is the
pivotal regulator of the reproductive system through
its stimulation of pituitary gonadotropin secretion
and consequent stimulation of gametogenesis and
steroidogenesis [1]. sex steroids (e.g. androgens and
estrogens) resulting from this cascade stimulate accessory reproductive tissues such as the prostate and breast.
the pituitary  xxxg931xxx  (type i) is a g-proteincoupled receptor [2] which couples preferentially to gq
to stimulate ca2+, protein kinase c and map kinase
signalling pathways [3]. prolonged  xxxg931xxx  stimulation with agonists results in gonadotrope desensitization and a decrease in circulating gonadotropin which
culminates in reduced steroid hormone production.
gnrh agonist analogs have therefore found wide and
extensive therapeutic application in hormone-dependent diseases [4–6], particularly in the treatment of
prostate cancer in which they constitute the pre-eminent therapy [5, 6].
reports of positive responses of breast cancer to gnrh
analogs in post-menopausal women [7] suggested that
they may also have direct antiproliferative affects independent of their lowering of sex steroid hormones. this
notion was supported by the demonstration of gnrh receptors in breast cancer tissue [8] and the demonstration
of antiproliferation effects of gnrh analogs in breast
cancer cell lines [9, 10]. subsequently, gnrh receptors
and antiproliferative effects of gnrh analogs have been
shown in a number of cell lines of reproductive tract tumors, including uterine, ovarian and prostatic cancers
and in non-reproductive tract tumors [for reviews, see 5,
6, 11, 12]. in prostate cancer tissue and cell lines gnrh
receptors have been identified [12–15] and antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of gnrh analogs demonstrated on prostate lncap,  xxxg1682xxx , du145 and bph-1 cell
lines [5, 12, 16–21]. in contrast to gnrh actions at the
pituitary which are mediated through the gq g-protein,
these antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor
cells are mediated via the gi g-protein, focal adhesion
complexes involving  xxxg2198xxx , and the p38 and jnk stressactivated kinases [16, 22–24].
recently the type i  xxxg931xxx  has been shown
to modulate the functional activity of both the estrogen
[25] and progesterone [26] receptors in the absence
of ligands. we therefore considered that gnrh antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cell lines may in
part be mediated via modulation of  xxxg183xxx 
(ar) function and now present evidence that type i
286

 xxxg931xxx  stimulation can induce nuclear localization of the ar while not activating its transcriptional
capacity. moreover, we could demonstrate functional
antagonism of testosterone by gnrh in prostate organ
culture.
the regulation of the ar has been shown to be controlled in part by the cellular expression of the hydrogen
peroxide-inducible clone 5 protein (hic-5) which is an
ar co-activator, also known as ara-55 [27]. hic-5 can
enhance function in a steroid-independent manner in
several prostate cancer cell lines [27] and tissue distribution studies have demonstrated that ara-55/hic-5 may
be differentially expressed during various progressive
stages of prostate cancer [28].
hic-5 interacts with src-family kinases and also with
cell adhesion kinase- (cak-, or  xxxg1890xxx  [29, 30]) which
can phosphorylate hic-5 [31]. however, the related focal
adhesion kinase (fak) does not posses the capacity to
tyrosine phosphorylate hic-5. underlying its role as an
important adapter protein, hic-5 can also interact via its
carboxyl-terminal lim domains with the cytoplasmic
tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest [32] and the tumor suppressor tyrosine phosphatase pten [33]. it therefore appears that hic-5 can control the critical activity of  xxxg2198xxx  function at focal adhesion sites in several
ways. overexpression of hic-5 could therefore underlie
its ability to induce senescent-like phenotypes in immortalized fibroblasts [34], and promote cellular differentiation in many cell lines [35]. it is of clinical interest that
the expression of  xxxg1890xxx  which is the binding partner for
hic-5, is inversely correlated with the grade of prostate
tissue malignancy [36].
since gnrh affects the activity of  xxxg1890xxx  [37], we investigated whether it could affect ar function. we first used
a model hek293 cell line stably expressing the gnrh
type i receptor to demonstrate that gnrh activation of
 xxxg1890xxx  and  xxxg2198xxx  tyrosine kinases can control the ability of
the steroid receptor co-activator hic-5 to modulate ar
function. we then demonstrated gnrh activation of the
pathway in  xxxg1682xxx  and lncap prostate cancer cell lines and
in the bph-1 prostate hyperplasia cell line. these studies
revealed that the relative contribution of  xxxg1890xxx  and  xxxg2198xxx 
can have profound effects on gnrh-induced ar subcellular localization. these effects were also demonstrable
in primary cultures of rat prostate cells and gnrh was
found to antagonize  xxxd3327xxx -stimulated growth of rat
prostate organ cultures.

introduction

reagents
cytochalasin d,  xxxd2448xxx ,  xxxd1307xxx  (4-amino-5-(4-cholorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), genistein,  xxxd2271xxx -a, ro-31-8220, bapta-am and  xxxd3536xxx  were all obtained from calbiochem. rgds and rges peptides and gnrh
were obtained from sigma. the cdna encoding the flag-tagged
and wild-type hic-5, and the gfp-tagged human ar were generous donations from m. stallcup and o. janne.
cell culture and transfection
hek293 cells stably expressing the rat type i  xxxg931xxx 
(designated scl60) [38] and benign prostate hyperplasia (bph-1)
cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagles medium
(dmem; sigma) and lncap and  xxxg1682xxx  in ham’s f-12. both were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% glutamine and 1%
penicillin (10,000 units/ml)/streptomycin (10,000 g/ml) at 37 ° c
in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere. prior to studies of ar function the media were replaced (for 24 h) with phenol red-free
dmem supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine
serum. scl60 cells were serum-deprived in 0.1% fetal calf serum
for 16h. transient transfections of the hek293 cells were performed using superfect (qiagen) as described previously [39].
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
cellular protein extracts were prepared as described previously [38]. flag-tagged hic-5 was immunoprecipitated with 20
l of a 50% slurry of anti-flag epitope m2 affinity agarose (sigma) with agitation for 16 h at 4 ° c. gfp-tagged human  xxxd3327xxx 
receptor (har-gfp) was immunoprecipitated with 20 l of a
30% slurry of an agarose-conjugated anti-gfp polyclonal (santa
cruz).  xxxg1890xxx  was immunoprecipitated with 4 g of anti- xxxg1890xxx 
monoclonal serum (transduction laboratories) plus 25 l of a
50% slurry of protein g plus/protein a agarose (calbiochem).
 xxxg1890xxx  was immunoblotted using mouse anti- xxxg1890xxx  monoclonal
antiserum (transduction laboratories) at 1: 1,000 dilution. a
1: 7,000 dilution of alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal
anti-mouse igg was used as a secondary antibody (sigma). all
other primary antisera were also subsequently detected using a
species-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary at a
1:7,000 dilution (sigma). human ar was detected using a rabbit
anti-ar polyclonal igg (santa cruz). flag epitope-tagged
hic-5 was detected using a 1:1,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-hic-5
polyclonal sera provided by dr. m. stallcup. src was detected
with anti-src rabbit polyclonal igg ( xxxg1511xxx : santa cruz). detection
of autophosphorylated  xxxg2198xxx  was performed using a rabbit antiy418 phosphorylated  xxxg2198xxx  polyclonal sera (biosource). protein
tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by a 1:1,000 dilution of
mouse antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal (py99: santa cruz). visualization of alkaline-phosphatase labelled proteins was performed using enzyme-linked chemifluorescence (amersham
pharmacia biotech) and quantified using a storm 860 phosphorimager.
 xxxd3327xxx  reporter gene assay
scl60 cells transiently transfected with the har-gfp and or
hic-5 were employed for the steroid response element activation
assay. a basic luciferase-linked ar response element and a -galactosidase reporter was used as transfection efficiency controls.

gnrh antagonism of testosterone
action at the prostate

after incubation for 48 h post-transfection in charcoal-stripped
dmem, growth media cells were stimulated either with testosterone (1 n m, 2 h) or with  xxxd2227xxx  (10 nm, 2 h). the dual-light luciferase and -galactosidase assay system (applied biosystems) was
employed to measure luciferase activity.
immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy
confocal microscopy was performed on a zeiss lsm510 laser
scanning microscope. flag-hic-5 was visualized after fixation
and permeabilization as described previously [38] using a 1: 100
dilution of a cy3-conjugated anti-flag m2 monoclonal (sigma).
the subcellular distribution of har-gfp constructs was detected
using excitation at 488 nm. co-localization studies of the flaghic-5 and har-gfp were performed using dual-line switching
excitation (488 nm for gfp, 568 nm for cy3) and emission (515–
540 nm gfp, 590–610 nm cy3) filter sets. endogenous ars were
visualized with a 1: 100 dilution of anti-ar monoclonal serum
(dako) followed by a 1:100 dilution of anti-mouse tritc-conjugated secondary antibody.
prostate tissue and organ culture
neonatal ventral prostate were microdissected from 0-day-old
wistar rats and cultured in the absence of serum with or without
testosterone as previously described [40] and with various concentrations of  xxxd2227xxx  for up to 6 days in continuous culture. tissue images (leica mz fliii imaging system) were measured for
their cross-sectional areas [40]. ventral mesenchymal pad (vmp)
tissue was removed from day-0 wistar rats and sub-cultured in
rpm1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin and l-glutamine. the gfp-tagged har construct was introduced into subcultured cells by electroporation
with a bio-rad gene pulser and cells assayed for the expression
of the har-gfp 24–48 h after electroporation.

results

effect of gnrh on gfp-tagged human ar
har-gfp largely existed in the cytoplasm after incubation in the absence of steroid receptor ligands (fig. 1).
testosterone and gnrh induced an increase in the
amount of nuclear har-gfp localization (fig. 1). gnrhinduced nuclear localization was sensitive to inhibition
of  xxxg2198xxx  activity by genistein (fig. 1e). in contrast, inhibition of pkc activity (by ro-31-8220) or chelation of intracellular ca2+ (by bapta-am) failed to affect
the gnrh-induced gfp translocation (fig. 1e). nuclear
translocation was sensitive to inhibition of pi-3k with
 xxxd3536xxx  (fig. 1e). since hic-5 can modulate ar function and is itself modulated by  xxxg1890xxx  which is activated by
gnrh, we next examined the ability of gnrh to recruit
focal adhesion complexes.

gnrh activates focal adhesion kinases in scl60
cells expressing the  xxxg931xxx 
gnrh stimulation of lt2 pituitary cells has been
shown to control the activation of the ca2+-dependent
 xxxg2198xxx   xxxg1890xxx  [37]. in our model cell system of
hek293 stably expressing the  xxxg931xxx  (designated scl60), gnrh induced a time-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation of both fak and  xxxg1890xxx  (fig. 2).

we noted a reduced degree of hic-5 and  xxxg1890xxx  association,
thus demonstrating that the transient gnrh-induced interaction was associated with the catalytic activity of
 xxxg1890xxx  (fig. 3c). since the type i  xxxg931xxx  is able to
induce  xxxg1890xxx  association with the steroid receptor co-activator hic-5, we further investigated whether gnrh
could induce association of other signalling proteins with
hic-5.

cellular overexpression of hic-5 results in a
potentiation of the gnrh-induced translocation of
har-gfp
co-expression of hic-5 greatly enhanced gnrh-induced har-gfp nuclear translocation in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 5). even high levels of hic-5 overexgnrh antagonism of testosterone

nuclear ar translocation was sensitive to the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd1307xxx , and to disruptors of cytoskeletal dynamics,
cytochalasin-d and latrunculin-b, suggesting a role for
the cytoskeleton in gnrh stimulated ar translocation
(fig. 5f). pre-incubation of the cells with the integrin antagonist rgds, but not rges, also attenuated the gnrhmediated ar translocation (fig. 5f).
it has been recently demonstrated that the association
of  xxxg1890xxx  with hic-5 acts as an inhibitory regulator of ar
activity [41]. we investigated this by overexpressing the
 xxxg1890xxx  dominant-negative kinase-defective mutant (pkm)
with a sub-threshold level (1 g) of hic-5 expression that
did not elevate the gnrh-induced ar nuclear translocation. co-transfection with pkm potentiated the gnrh
induction of ar translocation (fig. 5e). in contrast, this
did not enhance t-induced ar translocation (fig. 5e). we

gnrh induces the co-association and activation of
hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx 
non-receptor  xxxg2198xxx  src is also present in the
anti-flag hic-5 immune complexes (fig. 3d). there was
a low level of co-association between the two proteins in
the absence of gnrh which was increased by gnrh
stimulation (fig. 3d, e). the catalytic activity of the src
(y148 p-tyr src) associated with hic-5 was elevated by
the gnrh stimulation (fig. 3f). however, in contrast to
the gnrh-induced association between hic-5 and  xxxg1890xxx ,
the association between hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx  was more stable
and persisted after 30 min of gnrh stimulation (data not
shown). we next investigated whether these gnrh-induced hic-5 protein-protein interactions involved any alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation. gnrh (10 nm) induced an initial stimulation at 1 min followed by a second
increase in phosphorylation at 5 min (fig. 4a, b). this biphasic change in hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation status
may be due to the complex interaction induced by gnrh
of hic-5 with both  xxxg1890xxx  and then  xxxg2198xxx . both the  xxxg2198xxx 
kinase chemical inhibitors,  xxxd1307xxx  and  xxxd2271xxx -a, potently inhibited the gnrh-induced hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation while pkm overexpression had a much lower effect on hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation (fig. 4c, d). at
earlier time points the hic-5 phosphorylation was more
sensitive to pkm expression (fig. 3c). therefore the protracted association between hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx  appears to be
dominant and thus responsible for the majority of longlasting tyrosine phosphorylation of hic-5 after gnrh
stimulation. in view of these findings, we next investigated the effects of hic-5 on the subcellular distribution
of the human ar. we employed a gfp-tagged receptor
for these studies, which allowed the monitoring of its activity in cells using confocal laser microscopy.

gfp resulted in an elevation in the association between
 xxxg2198xxx  and har-gfp (fig. 6c, d). therefore it appears that
there is a gnrh-induced  xxxg2198xxx -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of hic-5 which is followed by an association
of the hic-5- xxxg2198xxx  complex with har-gfp. however, it
appears that the  xxxg2198xxx  association with har-gfp is not
as profound or as protracted as the gnrh-induced hic5-har-gfp interaction.
gnrh induces a co-translocation of the
hic-5/har-gfp complex to the cell nucleus
when flag-hic-5 and har-gfp were co-expressed
in the absence of gnrh both proteins existed predominantly in the cytoplasm (fig. 7a). gnrh induced the migration of both har-gfp and hic-5 to the nucleus
(fig. 7b). thus in addition to its ability to induce a dynamic association between har-gfp and hic-5, gnrh
receptor stimulation is capable of inducing co-translocation of both molecules to the cell nucleus. it appears,
therefore, that in appropriate cellular environments (i.e.

induced by testosterone. cells were transfected with the
gfp-tagged har with or without hic-5, a basic nuclear
 xxxd3327xxx  response element linked to the luciferase reporter gene and the control marker -galactosidase, and
then stimulated with gnrh or testosterone. gnrh failed
to elevate luciferase activity in the absence of overexpressed hic-5 while testosterone induced a substantial luciferase response (fig. 8). when hic-5 was overexpressed
there was a minimal gnrh-induced increase in the luciferase reporter activity, but an enhancement of the luneuroendocrinology 2006;84:285–300

ciferase response to testosterone. when gnrh and testosterone were incubated together there was a significant
antagonistic action of gnrh on the luciferase transcription induced by testosterone in a background of moderate

and can antagonize the testosterone-induced transcriptional activity. as the above studies were examined in our
model cellular environment, scl60 cells, we next investigated whether these events also occurred in the  xxxg1682xxx ,
lncap and bph-1 prostate cell lines.
gnrh induces an alteration in the subcellular
distribution of the har-gfp in prostate cell lines
the gfp-tagged har was used to investigate whether
stimulation of endogenous gnrh receptors known to be
present in prostate cell lines could mobilize the ar to the
nucleus. gnrh stimulation induced nuclear translocation of har-gfp in  xxxg1682xxx  cells (fig. 9a) but not in lncap
cells (fig. 9b). in both cell lines, application of testosterone resulted in a significant nuclear translocation of the
expressed har-gfp (fig. 9a, b). examination of the intracellular protein milieu revealed a dearth of  xxxg1890xxx  and
high levels of hic-5 in  xxxg1682xxx  cells compared to a surfeit of
 xxxg1890xxx  and lower levels of hic-5 in lncaps (fig. 9c). the
 xxxg1682xxx  cells also had higher levels of  xxxg2198xxx  than lncaps.
these differences may offer an explanation for the failure
of gnrh to induce nuclear translocation of har-gfp in
the lncap cells. in both cell lines there were similar levels of fak and  xxxg1366xxx . thus it appears that in prostate cell
lines, as in the scl60 model system, the presence of sufficient hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx  is required for gnrh induction of
har. high expression of the negative regulatory  xxxg1890xxx  in

stimulated with either gnrh (10 nm) or testosterone (t, 1 nm) for
2 h. both ligands were also co-incubated for the specified experiments. half of the cell cultures were also co-transfected with the
flag-tagged hic-5 construct (2 g/100-mm plate). the expression of each signalling protein was independently verified for its
expression within the cells by immunoblot (not shown). the relative enhancement in luciferase activity was measured and then
normalized to the degree of -galactosidase expression within the
specific cell population. in spite of its ability to translocate ar to
the nucleus under these conditions, gnrh did not significantly
stimulate ar-transcriptional activity in contrast to t. in the presence of hic-5, gnrh partially antagonized t-mediated transcriptional activity. the data presented in the histogram represents

the har-gfp. gnrh stimulation of  xxxg1682xxx  cells (panel a) induced
a moderate elevation in the nuclear localization of har-gfp (images 2 and 8) in comparison to the effects of t (images 3 and 9).
in contrast, when har-gfp-expressing lncap cells were stimulated with gnrh there was no measurable change in the hargfp nuclear content (images 11 and 17) while t induced a profound nuclear translocation of har-gfp (images 12 and 18). the
endogenous levels of the previously identified proteins associated
with the signal cascade between the  xxxg931xxx  and the hargfp were therefore investigated by immunoblot analysis (panel

seem, at least in part, to be responsible for the inability of
gnrh to mobilize the har in this prostate tumor cell
line. gnrh-induced translocation was attenuated by
 xxxd1307xxx ,  xxxd2271xxx -a and the cytoskeletal disruptors, cytochalasin-d, latrunculin-b, rgds but not rges (fig. 9) as
was found for the scl60 cells. to demonstrate that such
gnrh-mediated effects also pertain to the functioning
of endogenous har, we utilized the human bph-1 cell
line which we have found to express ar in contrast to
some other reports. we noted a moderate level of hic-5
expression in the cells and a moderate gnrh-stimulated
endogenous ar translocation when compared to testosterone (fig. 10). increased expression of hic-5 enhanced
the ability of gnrh to translocate the ar. in addition, a
similar multi-protein complex to that seen in scl60 cells
was induced by gnrh between hic-5,  xxxg2198xxx  and the endogenous bph-1 ar (fig. 10b). when we tested for ar

transcriptional activity induced by gnrh in these cell
lines, a similar lack of activation to that seen in scl60
cells was observed (data not shown).

gnrh controls the growth of whole prostate tissue
in view of our demonstration that gnrh stimulation
can induce nuclear translocation of a transcriptionallyinactive ar in scl60,  xxxg1682xxx  and bph-1 cells, it was of interest to determine whether gnrh was functionally antagonistic to testosterone in a physiological setting. we
tested this hypothesis using rat ventral prostate tissue
(ventral mesenchymal pad, vmp), and an organ culture
model, i.e. the rat ventral prostate [40]. as a prelude to
this experiment, we assayed whether gnrh could control the har in cultured prostatic tissue in a similar manner to that seen in the model scl60 and  xxxg1682xxx  cell lines.
gfp-tagged ar was successfully transfected into rat

the relative surface area of the ventral prostate organ was measured at various time-points. prostate organ growth was measured by flat surface area at days 0, 3 and 5 of treatment with either
no t, t or t plus 10 nm gnrh (n = 3). d represents actual organ
size (in arbitrary units of measured surface area) of collected
pools of organs after 6 days of treatment either with testosterone
alone (control: n = 6) or testosterone with 1 nm gnrh (n = 8), 10
nm gnrh (n = 10) or 100 nm gnrh (n = 6). statistical significance was estimated using an unpaired student’s t test, p values
were as follows (asterisks): 1 n m gnrh, p = 0.044; 10 nm gnrh,
p = 0.016; 100 nm gnrh, p = 0.02.

vmp cells sub-cultured for 2 days after removal from
day-0 rats. treatment with gnrh (10 nm, 60 min) induced a potent nuclear translocation in these cells
(fig. 11a). we also assessed whether the endogenous ar
could be mobilized to the nucleus by gnrh stimulation
of the vmp cells. gnrh stimulation induced translocation of the tritc-labelled ar (fig. 11b). next we tested
whether gnrh would antagonize testosterone stimulation of whole prostate growth. when stimulated with
1 nm testosterone alone there was a 250% increase in
organ surface area compared to organs not stimulated

with testosterone (fig. 11c). however, when 10 nm gnrh
was added with 1 nm testosterone, there was a significant
reduction in the growth rate of the tissue, resulting in a
growth increase of only 150% of control after 5 days of
treatment (fig. 11c). to extend these studies, larger groups
of organs were assessed over 6 days using the same testosterone (1 nm) and gnrh (10 nm) concentrations and
using lower (1 nm) and higher (100 nm) doses of gnrh.
even at 1 nm gnrh there was a significant inhibition of
testosterone-stimulated growth (fig. 11d).

prostatic hyperplasia and cancer represents the largest
group of reproductive pathophysiologies in men. prostate
development, growth, and prostate diseases are profoundly controlled by circulating  xxxd3327xxx  and also by
the functional capacity of the steroid ar. chronic treatment with gnrh analogs inhibits  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx 
and testicular  xxxd3327xxx  production and this approach is
therefore used in the treatment of prostatic cancer. in addition to this indirect action through lowering sex steroids, gnrh analogs have direct inhibitory effects on
proliferation and growth of reproductive tissue tumor
cells of the breast, uterus, ovary and prostate which express gnrh receptors [5, 6, 11, 13–15]. these effects are
apparently mediated through activation of gi, stress-activated protein kinases (erk, jnk and p38), and dephosphorylation of the egf receptor [2, 11, 16, 17, 23, 24]. the
demonstration that gnrh can modulate functional activity of the estrogen [25] and progesterone [26] receptors
suggested that part of the direct inhibitory effects of
gnrh on prostatic cancer cells may be mediated by modulation of the ar.
studies in several cell systems demonstrated that certain functions of the  xxxg931xxx  are mediated through
the dynamic control of focal adhesion proteins such as
fak [38]. recently, focal adhesion proteins have been
shown to affect transcriptional and intermediary cell metabolism in addition to affecting cytoskeletal organization [for review, see 42]. these multi-protein plasma
membrane scaffolds have the potential to facilitate and
discretely control the propagation of cellular signals to
the nucleus. hic-5 was identified as a homolog of the focal adhesion protein  xxxg1904xxx  [43] which is a homologue
of ara-55, a steroid ar co-factor [27]. this protein can
interact with the human ar and induce partial activation
in the absence of testosterone [27]. therefore we hypothesized that this novel protein may form some type of
functional nexus between the capacity of gnrh to control focal adhesion dynamics and effects on peripheral
reproductive tissues that are sensitive to sex steroid hormones such as the prostate.
as a proof of concept we initially utilized the model
scl60 cell line stably expressing the  xxxg931xxx  and
endogenously expressing hic-5,  xxxg1890xxx  and fak. gnrh
stimulation contemporaneously elevated the tyrosine
phosphorylation status of these proteins and modulated
the activation and subcellular localization of transfected
human ar. we further noted that gnrh-activated  xxxg1890xxx 
was able to associate with hic-5. interestingly the assognrh antagonism of testosterone
action at the prostate

ciation was rapid but transient. overexpression of the kinase-dead dominant negative  xxxg1890xxx  diminished the capacity of the endogenous  xxxg1890xxx  to associate with hic-5
suggesting that the catalytic activity of  xxxg1890xxx  is required
for the novel transient association. in contrast to this
transient gnrh-induced association of  xxxg1890xxx  with hic-5,
the association of hic-5 with cytoplasmic  xxxg2198xxx  was protracted. there appears to be a basal linkage between hic5 and  xxxg2198xxx , as would be expected as they both associate
with many cytoskeletal and focal adhesion complex proteins [29, 43, 44]. the catalytic activity of the  xxxg2198xxx  present in the hic-5 immunoprecipitate was significantly elevated in a time-dependent manner demonstrating that
the pre-associated  xxxg2198xxx  and hic-5 were activated by
gnrh. it has been reported that hic-5 possesses the capacity to associate with the endogenous regulator of the
 xxxg2198xxx  family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases csk ( xxxg2198xxx 
kinase), thus suggesting a potential scaffolding function
that may allow hic-5 to co-localize with these two interacting proteins [43]. the hic-5 related protein,  xxxg1904xxx ,
has also been demonstrated to act as a functional scaffolding protein for the adapter protein crk [45–47]. the
overall homology between hic-5 and  xxxg1904xxx  suggests
that these proteins may have overlapping functions. like
 xxxg1904xxx , hic-5 can be found both at cytoskeletal focal
adhesion sites and also in the nucleus [34, 43]. the lim
domains of both proteins appear to enable this specific
subcellular localization. interestingly, despite many similarities between  xxxg1904xxx  and hic-5, they are proposed to
control cell metabolism in contrasting ways. thus, hic-5
has been associated with cell senescence [48] while  xxxg1904xxx  is often linked with cell growth and transformation
[45, 49, 50]. hic-5 and  xxxg1904xxx  have been suggested to act
as functional antagonists of each other. like  xxxg1904xxx  it
appears that hic-5 can be tyrosine phosphorylated upon
interaction with focal adhesion complexes [30]. this tyrosine phosphorylation may serve to create docking sites
for the sh2 domains of cytoplasmic/cytoskeletal proteins
such as  xxxg2198xxx  and crk. when we studied the effects of
gnrh on the expressed hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation
status we noted a biphasic temporal relationship. investigation of the potential mediators of hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation indicated that the increase in  xxxd1075xxx  at the 20-min time-point was almost entirely sensitive to inhibition of src-family non-receptor tyrosine
kinases and relatively insensitive to expression of pkm.
it appears, therefore, that the late and more protracted
phase of hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation is src-based, in
agreement with the previously demonstrated protracted
association of hic-5 with  xxxg2198xxx  compared to  xxxg1890xxx . fujineuroendocrinology 2006;84:285–300

discussion

neuroendocrinology 2006;84:285–300

gnrh-induced nuclear translocation of the har (the
levels of endogenous hic-5 present in both of these cell
types were similar). in addition, the expression of  xxxg2198xxx 
was also greater in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. therefore the presence of
higher levels of hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx  combined with a paucity
of  xxxg1890xxx  in the  xxxg1682xxx  cells explains the greater functional
ar-mobilizing capacity of gnrh in these cells compared
to that in lncap cells. these findings may explain the
observation of a positive correlation of hic-5 and inverse
correlation of  xxxg1890xxx  with the grade of prostate malignancy [28, 36]. however, since  xxxg931xxx  expression is
variable in lncap cells, it is possible that gnrh was ineffective due to an absence of  xxxg931xxx .
although gnrh stimulation can result in a potent nuclear translocation of the har in the scl60 model system and in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia cell lines, the transcriptional activity of the gnrhmobilized har was negligible. this contrasted with the
 xxxd3327xxx -translocated har in the same cellular setting
and suggests that the gnrh-translocated har was transformed into a transcriptionally-inactive state. this suggested that gnrh might functionally antagonize testosterone actions by sequestering the ar into this transcriptionally-inactive state. to test this hypothesis in a
physiologically relevant model we measured the effect of
gnrh on the growth of prostate organ cultures. continuous stimulation with gnrh (1–100 nm) of whole
prostates in organ culture resulted in a reduction in the
growth rate of the tissue induced by testosterone. when
the sub-cultured rat ventral mesenchymal pad prostate
tissue was stimulated with gnrh, both endogenous and
transiently expressed (gfp-tagged) ar were translocated
to the nucleus as seen previously in both our model cell
line and in the  xxxg1682xxx - and bph-1-cultured prostate cell
lines. thus it appears that when pre-incubated with
gnrh and subsequently treated with testosterone, there
is indeed a functional antagonistic effect of gnrh. the
mechanism of gnrh inhibition of  xxxd3327xxx -induced
transcriptional activation of ar was not addressed in our
study. since acetylation [53] and phosphorylation [54] of
ar are known to affect transcriptional activity, these
post-translational modifications may mediate gnrh
effects on ar activity and will be the subject of future
studies.
in conclusion, we have shown that the activation of the
 xxxg931xxx  can control the functional dynamics of
several divergent focal adhesion proteins. alteration of
the tyrosine phosphorylation status of some of these proteins,  xxxg1890xxx , hic-5 and  xxxg2198xxx , can then transfer the signal
generation from the activated  xxxg931xxx  to the humaudsley /davidson /pawson /freestone /

moto et al. [27] noted that the cloned ar co-factor ara55 bore a striking resemblance to the murine hic-5. subsequently, yang et al. [51] demonstrated that hic-5 could
interact with the classical steroid hormone receptors and
that the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger lim domains
were required for its capacity to associate with focal adhesions, the nuclear matrix and steroid receptors. it should
be noted that since gnrh treatment is activating  xxxg2198xxx  in
our system, it appears that hic-5 recruitment by gnrh
does not involve the association with csk.
we therefore investigated the hypothesis that the
 xxxg931xxx -mediated alteration of focal adhesion
complexes [37, 38] may propagate to many other signalling systems, and demonstrated gnrh-induced translocation of the ar to the nucleus. examination of putative
intracellular mediators of the ar translocation revealed
a sensitivity to genistein and  xxxd3536xxx , indicating a
role of  xxxg2198xxx  and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase activity. overexpression of hic-5 enhanced gnrh stimulation of har
translocation to the cell nucleus, comparable to that mediated by testosterone. overexpression of hic-5 has been
shown to enhance the activity and nuclear translocation
of several members of the steroid receptor family [27, 51].
in accordance with a recent report [41] we also noted a
suppressive effect of  xxxg1890xxx  upon hic-5 ar regulatory activity and could successfully counteract this by expression of the dominant negative  xxxg1890xxx  construct (k457a)
and induce an efficient nuclear translocation of the har.
contemporaneous with these effects, we demonstrated
that gnrh stimulation induced a protracted physical association with the har. along with the gnrh-induced
har-hic-5 association there was a time-dependent elevation in the linkage between  xxxg2198xxx  and the har, another characteristic of an activated ar [for review, see 52].
the gnrh-induced association of the har with hic-5
also involved a co-migration of both associated proteins
to the cell nucleus. despite the ability of gnrh to induce
a testosterone-like ar mobilization and association with
hic-5, there was negligible transactivation of a luciferaselinked ar response element in contrast to the robust activation by testosterone. moreover, gnrh markedly inhibited the testosterone stimulation in the presence of
hic-5. we then studied the effects of gnrh upon har
activity in a prostatic cellular background and noted differential effects of gnrh actions depending upon the
intracellular milieu of the specific cells employed. in
lncap prostate cancer cells with relatively high  xxxg1890xxx 
levels, there was a minimal gnrh-induced translocation
of har as might be expected. however, in  xxxg1682xxx  cells in
which  xxxg1890xxx  was undetectable there was an efficient

man ar resulting in modulation of its subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. this effect of gnrh
receptor stimulation was observed in both prostate cell
lines and also whole prostate organ culture. due to the
poor activation of ar transcriptional activity by gnrh
it can act as a potent functional antagonist of testosterone
stimulation of ar-positive cells. this inhibitory action of
gnrh on steroid hormone function may impact upon
the observation that gnrh analogs can inhibit the
growth of steroid-dependent prostate cell lines and tumors. thus the clinical regression of prostate cancer and
benign prostatic hyperplasia induced by gnrh analogs
may be due to the direct inhibition of ar function in addition to the classical  xxxd3327xxx -lowering effects of these
widely employed therapeutics. it appears, therefore, that
gnrh analogs may inhibit prostatic cancer through a

number of mechanisms. in addition to its classical action
of lowering circulating  xxxd3327xxx  through pituitary desensitization, gnrh analogs have direct antiproliferative
and pro-apoptotic effects on prostate cancer cell lines
[16–20], they induce cytoskeletal reorganization which
increases cell adherence [38] which may have implications in metastasis, and they directly inhibit  xxxd3327xxx 
effects. a recent demonstration that castrated men with
 xxxg931xxx -positive prostate cancer respond to
gnrh analog therapy while receptor-negative men do
not [55] supports this notion. the relative contribution of
these diverse effects in gnrh analog treatment of prostatic cancer requires elucidation. the ability of different
gnrh analogs to selectively affect these diverse effects
[16, 23, 56] offers an opportunity to develop more selective antitumor pathway targeting.
