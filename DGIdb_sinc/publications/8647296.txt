abstract a search for sequences homologous to the  xxxg1618xxx 
receptor cdna in a rat hypothalamic library has identified a
novel  xxxg1618xxx  receptor (ntr-2). the 1539 bp cdna encodes
a 416 amino acid protein and shows highest homology to the
previously cloned  xxxg1618xxx  receptor (ntr-i) (64% homology
and 43% identity). binding and pharmacological studies
demonstrate that ntr-2 expressed in cos cells recognizes
 xxxg1618xxx  (nt) with high affinity as well as several other
agonists and antagonists. however, a fundamental difference was
found; unlike ntr-1, ntr-2 recognizes, with high affinity,
 xxxd2469xxx , a histamine h i receptor antagonist previously
shown to compete with nt for low-affinity binding sites in brain.

study comparing the distributions of n t r and n t r transcripts in rat brain strongly suggested the existence of another
n t r [24,25]. n t r transcripts are detected in several regions
of the brain, but not in the subfornical organ, though n t
binding sites were clearly associated with the cell bodies in
this region [24]. these findings prompted us to undertake a
search for other n t r s using a strategy based on sequence
homology with the known n t r . we describe here the molecular cloning of a novel n t r sharing 64% homology with the
previously described receptor. we also report on the binding
and pharmacological properties of this receptor expressed in
cos cells.

2. materials and methods
i. introduction
 xxxg1618xxx  (nt) is a tridecapeptide involved in intercellular communication in the central nervous system and peripheral organs [1]. in the brain, n t acts as a neurotransmitter/
neuromodulator [2,3]. in particular, it modulates dopamine
transmission in the nigrostrial and mesolimbic pathways
[4,5]. additionally, n t plays a role in nociception, hypothermia, control of pituitary hormone secretion and muscle relaxation [6]. in adult rat brain, n t binds at two distinct sites
distinguishable by (i) their sensitivity to  xxxd2469xxx , a  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist and (ii) their differential affinity to  xxxg1618xxx  [7]. the  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive n t r appears after birth and exhibits a distribution in the brain
different from the high-affinity n t r [8].
high-affinity  xxxd2469xxx -insensitive n t r has been
cloned from rat [9] and human [10,11]. this receptor represents less than 30% of the n t binding sites in the rat adult
brain; and is found mainly in tile substantia nigra and the
ventral tegmental area. the cloned rat n t r is a 424 amino
acid protein that belongs to the g-protein-coupled superfamily of receptors. the biochemical and pharmacological properties of this receptor have been extensively studied (for a review
see [6]). it has been shown that upon activation the receptor
modulates intracellular levels of c g m p [12], c a m p [13,14]
and inositol phosphates [15-19]. the recently discovered
non-peptide n t antagonist, sr 48692a inhibits the binding
of n t to the cloned receptor [20]. however, a recent study
shows that in mouse and rat, nt-induced hypothermia and
analgesia are insensitive to sr48692 [21], suggesting that n t
can act through different receptor subtypes. sr48692 has also
been shown to differentially affect nt-induced behavior and
changes in dopaminergic transmission [22,23]. besides pharmacological arguments in favor of n t r subtypes, a recent

2.1. drugs and peptides
a25i-labeled [tyr3] xxxg1618xxx  and unlabeled  xxxg1618xxx  were purchased from nen and sigma, respectively. dulbecco's modified essential medium (dmem), fetal calf serum (fcs) and phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were from gibco (paisley, uk). bovine serum
albumin (bsa), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) and 1,10-phenanthroline were from sigma (st. louis, mo). a selective, non-peptide antagonist sr 48692 was synthesized at sanofi recherche, montpellier, france [20]. the anti-histamine agent,  xxxd2469xxx , was
obtained from janssen pharmaceutica (geel, belgium).
2.2. rna extraction and analysis
total rna was extracted from rat hypothalamus using the acid
guanidinium isothiocyanate phenol chloroform method [26]. poly(a)
containing rna was isolated from total rna by oligo(dt)-cellulose
chromatography as described by aviv and leder [27]. rna was sizefractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels then
blotted to nitrocellulose membranes [28]. hybridization with a 32p_
labeled ntr cdna was performed under low stringency conditions.
2.3. edna library construction and dna sequencing
the cdna library was constructed using the primer-adapter procedure [29] and the  xxxd2923xxx -t7 vector (pharmacia). nucleotide dna
sequences were determined by the dideoxy method of sanger et al.
[301.
2.4. transfection o f cos cells and binding experiments
the pharmacological characterization was performed using cos-3
cells transfected with psvl- xxxg1619xxx  recombinant vector. 3 days after
transfection, cell monolayers in 6-well plates were washed twice with
50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5, 0.1% bsa, 0.1% nan3, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (binding buffer) before the binding of radioligand.
saturation experiments were performed in 1 ml of binding buffer
containing 12~i- xxxg1618xxx  over the range from 0.05 to 14.5 nm.
after 1 h incubation at room temperature, the medium was aspirated
and cell monolayers were washed twice with incubation buffer. finally, cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 1 n naoh and bound radioactivity was evaluated. non-specific binding was defined as binding in
the presence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and under these
experimental conditions was less than 1% of the total counts.
displacement experiments were conducted in an analogous manner
using 0.2 nm 125i- xxxg1618xxx  as radioligand.  xxxg1618xxx ,  xxxg1618xxx , sr 48692 and  xxxd2469xxx  were used as competitors.

3.1. cloning and sequencing o f protein related to the n t
receptor
data from pharmacological studies consistently suggest
that more than one  xxxg1618xxx  receptor might exist. based
on the assumption that ntr subtypes could be structurally
related, we screened by homology a cdna library made from
rat hypothalamus. approximately half a million recombinant
bacteria were plated at high density on filters. hybridization
under low stringency conditions with a labeled rat ntr
edna probe yielded several positive clones which were subsequently isolated. systematic dna sequencing analysis
showed that only one of them shared substantial homology
with the ntr cdna. this 1539 bp long edna contained a
large open-reading frame encoding a 416 amino acid protein.
the putative ntr-2 protein, which shows 43% identity and
64% homology with the ntr-1, has the structural features of
a g-protein-coupled receptor (fig. 1). interestingly, although
the lengths of both proteins are similar, the new receptor has a
shorter n-terminal extracellular region, and a longer cytoplasmic loop between the fifth and sixth putative transmembrane
regions. it should also be noted that the cytoplasmic c-terminal region shows the lowest homology to ntr-1.

bind to untransfected cells, or to cells transfected with the
vector dna alone (not shown). scatchard plot analysis of
12'~'i- xxxg1618xxx  binding (fig. 2a) showed a single high-affinity
population of receptors with a dissociation constant (kd) of
3.7 +-0.2 nm and a binding capacity (b.... ) of 180000 + 3000
sites/cell. fig. 2b shows competition curves of various ligands
with labeled  xxxg1618xxx . agonists and antagonists competed
for the binding of 125i- xxxg1618xxx  with an order of potency
similar to that for the ntr-1 previously described with the
exception of the high affinity of  xxxd2469xxx  [10].  xxxg1618xxx  is the most potent competitor, with an apparent half-maximal inhibiting concentration (ics0) of 0.77 nm, followed by
 xxxg1618xxx , ics0 5.1 nm, and  xxxd2469xxx , ics0 10.0 nm.
the recently described non-peptide antagonist, sr 48692,
showed an ics0 of 22.5 nm.

were also obtained with rna from heart and intestine. two
transcripts were systematically detected, with sizes of 1.6 and

nt site previously described [7]. ntr-2 transcripts are abundant in cortex and hypothalamus (fig. 3) (100 more than
ntr-1 mrna), and absent in pituitary gland and brain embryos (results not shown). ntr-2 transcripts are also found
in heart and gut, suggesting a possible implication of a nt/
ntr-2 pathway in muscle function. however, the functions
of ntr-2 are presently unknown. until now, levocabastinesensitive nt binding sites have been considered as recognition
sites for nt, devoid of signaling activity and hence named
acceptor sites [31]. it will be surprising, considering the gprotein-coupled receptor structure of ntr-2, if this receptor
does not signal to the cells. nonetheless, the molecular cloning
of ntr-2 will allow the testing of this assumption, and biochemical and pharmacological studies of ntr-2 which will
certainly shed light on the biology of this receptor.
in conclusion, it must be pointed out that the sensitivity of
ntr-2 to sr48692 makes its implication in sr-insensitive
nt-induced effects such as hypothermia and analgesia unlikely, and so suggests other(s) ntr subtype(s).
finally, the availability of rat ntr-2 cdna probe will
enable us to answer the important question of the existence
of an homologous receptor in man.

4. discussion

the discovery, almost a decade ago, of  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive nt sites in rat [8] suggested the existence of ntr subtypes. the recent molecular cloning of a  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
in rat [9] and human [10,11] (ntr-1), and the discovery of
selective non-peptide antagonists of the n t r [20] have provided further support for the existence of receptor subtypes.
sr48692, for example, inhibits nt binding to ntr-1 but
only antagonizes some of the effects of nt in vivo [21], suggesting that some of these effects might be mediated through
an sr 48692-insensitive ntr. in addition, recent findings
using a combination of high resolution in situ techniques demonstrated that ntr could be encoded by different mrnas
[24]. these observations constitute evidence for different types
of ntr and prompted us to search for homologous receptors.
we have identified a novel ntr (ntr-2) from rat hypothalamus which shares structural homologies (43% identity and
64% similarity) with ntr-1. interestingly, the lowest homologies between ntr-1 and ntr-2 are in their third cytoplasmic loops and c-terminal domains, two regions bearing coupling specificity to g-protein. binding studies show that the
affinity of nt for ntr-2 is slightly lower than for ntr-1
and that, importantly,  xxxd2469xxx  can efficiently compete
with nt for occupancy of this site.
ntr-2 seems to correspond to the  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive
