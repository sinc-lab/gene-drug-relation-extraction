it is unclear whether the palliative effects of  xxxd3270xxx  (tha) (tacrine, cognex) on the clinical symptoms
of patients affected by alzheimer’s disease (ad) are the result of its inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase or on other
complex sites of action. in order to investigate the cerebral distribution and kinetics of tha in the human brain in vivo,
we performed positron emission tomography (pet) imaging with [!c]n-methyl-tetrahydro-aminoacridine (mtha) in
healthy human volunteers. after intravenous injection, [‘‘c]mtha crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached its
maximum uptake between 10 and 40 minutes, depending on the brain regions. uptake was higher in the grey matter
structures, and lower in the white matter. after this peak, the radioactivity remained quasi-constant until 60 minutes in
all regions with a half-life varying from 2.44 hours in the thalamus to 3.42 hours in the cerebral cortex. the ratios of
regional to whole cerebral cortex brain radioactivity calculated between 50 and 70 minutes after the tracer injection were
1.14 + 0.04, 1.07 + 0.03 and 1.06 + 0.04 in the putamen, cerebellum and thalamus, respectively. overall, these results
show that: (1) [!'c]mtha crosses the blood-brain barrier easily and is highly concentrated in the brain; (2) the regional
brain distribution of [!'c]jmtha does not parallel that of in vivo acetylcholinesterase (ache) concentrations; and (3) the
cerebral kinetics of [''c]mtha are consistent with known plasmatic pharmacokinetics of tha in ad patients. we
conclude that pet imaging with [!'cj]mtha is a useful method for assessing the cerebral distribution and kinetics of
tha in vivo. eur j  xxxd122xxx  6:273-278 © 1999 lippincott williams & wilkins

introduction

the etiology of alzheimer’s disease (ad) is controver-
sial and the mechanisms inducing cellular neuropathol-
ogy are still not fully understood. however, the
impairment of the cholinergic system (whitehouse et
al., 1991) is well established and suggests that replace-
ment, increased availability or decreased degradation of
acetylcholine (ach) might improve memory in patients
affected by ad. among the cholinergic-enhancing
drugs proposed for the treatment of the cognitive
changes associated with ad, acetylcholinesterase in-
hibitors such as   xxxd3270xxx

(tha) (also known as tacrine or cognex) have been
proposed on the basis that they have the ability to
restore brain ach levels by inhibiting its breakdown.
tha was first claimed to produce significant benefits
in a cross-over comparison study with placebo in a
1986 study performed by summers and colleagues.
this first report triggered a wave of clinical trials into
tacrine efficacy, but subsequent studies have failed to
replicate its conclusions on the positive effects of
tacrine (fitten et al., 1990; schneider, 1990). the
results from later controlled trials (davis et al., 1992;

european journal of neurology 1999, vol 6 no3 273
farlow et al., 1992; knapp et al., 1994; forette et al.,
1995) were positive enough to motivate the approval of
the compound by the us food and drug administra-
tion and by the french agence du médicament.

evidence from large cohort trials made it clear that
certain patients respond better than others to tacrine
treatment. several factors may explain these differ-
ences. first, they could be due to individual variability
to the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, such as
rate of absorption, tissue distribution, and permeability
of the blood-brain barrier (ahlin et al., 1992). a
second, more intriguing possibility is that differential
response to tha may be related to the heterogeneity of
ad patients in terms of clinical, neurochemical and
neuropathological alterations. it has been speculated
that different degrees of dysfunction in the cholinergic
system and/or cortical degeneration could account for
different responses to tha (for a review see liberini
et al., 1996; poirier et al., 1996).

in addition, it should be stressed that the mechanism
of action of tha is not limited to the enhancement of
cholinergic function by way of acetylcholinesterase
(ache) inhibition and/or other interactions with choli-
nergic receptors (for a review see freeman and
dawson, 1991). there is evidence that tha also acts
on other sites and neurotransmitter systems which
could lead to different implications in ad patients. it
has been suggested that such a large spectrum of
pharmacological interactions could explain the effec-
tiveness of tha compared to more selective pro-
cholinergic drugs. it could also be speculated that a
difference in response to tha may be related to the
involvement of different tha sites in different sub-
groups of ad patients.

given that ad appears to be restricted to humans
and leads to degeneration of brain tissue, the relevance
of the cerebral distribution and kinetics of tha to
clinical activity is best explored by a method that
permits studying the human brain in vivo. for this
purpose, n-methyl-tetrahydro-aminoacridine (mtha),
a close derivative of tha, was labelled with [!'c] for
positron emission tomography (pet) imaging (bonnot
et al., 1991). in contrast to tha, which cannot be
labelled with a positron emitting isotope, this tha
derivative (methylated on its 9-amino group) can be
labelled with ['!c]. we have already reported that
[!'c]mtha has pharmacological characteristics similar
to those of tacrine in rats (tavitian et al., 1993). n-
methylation of tha does not significantly modify its
inhibitory activity towards ache, and the whole body
and brain distribution of [''cjmtha closely parallels
that of {h]tha (mena and desai, 1991). moreover,
there is competition between tha and [!'c]mtha for
binding sites in the brain. these findings have been

confirmed in vivo in non-human primates (tavitian et
al., 1993). here, we report the results of the first in
vivo pet study of cerebral [!'c]mtha distribution
and kinetics in healthy human volunteers.

materials and methods

patients

four healthy male subjects (mean age 65.5 years [range
47-79]) with no history of neurological or mental
disorders, and free of any drug treatment, were studied.
experimental procedures were approved by an ethical
committee on clinical investigations (comité consulta-
tif de protection des personnes dans la recherche
biomédicale) at the hépital bicétre in paris, france.
all subjects underwent the pet examination after
giving written informed consent.

pet and magnetic resonance imaging (mri)

pet and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies
were performed on the same day in each subject. mri
was performed in order to exclude silent cerebral
lesions, to obtain individual cerebral anatomy and to
determine the plane passing through the bicommissural
line (ac—pc line). for mri, contiguous, t1-weighted,
3 mm thick axial and sagittal slices were obtained using
an mrmax 0.5-t device. the patients’ heads were
positioned so that the transaxial images were parallel to
the ac--pc line defined on the medial sagittal mri t1
slice. external cutaneous marks corresponding to this
position were drawn on the subject’s face. using these
marks and by means of a crossed laser beam system
the head of the subject was carefully repositioned in
the same position on the pet camera. perfect position-
ing of the head was ensured by means of an individual
molded thermoplastic mask. pet scans were performed
using a siemens-cti ecat 931b pet tomograph (31
slices, spatial resolution using a hanning 0.5 recon-
struction filter, 8.4 x 8.4 x 4.8mm at full-width half
maximum). correction for 511-kev y-ray attenuation
by tissue was performed using 68ge—68ga transmis-
sion scans.

a sequence of 17 scans covering 70 minutes (4 x
lmin; 3 x2min; 2x2.5min; 5x 5min; 3 x 10
min) were acquired after the intravenous injection of
[!'c]mtha. in order to calculate the wash-out half-life
(ti/2) of the tracer from the brain, in one subject the
acquisition time was prolonged for 2h after the injec-
tion. [''cjmtha was synthesized in our chemical
facilities as described previously (bonnot et al., 1991)
and diluted in saline. the injected dose ranged from
3.35 to 23.60 mci (mean + sd = 15.86 + 9.61); the
sra was 552.85 + 569.84 mci/umoles (range,
74-1247 mci/umoles). within this range the amounts
in vivo pet study of cerebral [!!c] methyltetrahydroaminoacridine distribution and kinetics

of injected mtha varied from 18.9—133.8 nmoles
(mean + sd; 56.8 + 52.4 nmoles). serial venous blood
samples were simultaneously drawn during the course
of pet data acquisition. after blood centrifugation, the
plasma was separated from  xxxd187xxx  and counted in a
gamma counting system (cg 4000, kronton, france).
in addition, in one subject, the cerebral distribution
of [!'c]phy, a selective radioligand of brain ache,
was measured by means of an intravenous injection of
10.6 mci of {!'c]physostigmine (phy) according to
methods previously described (pappata et al., 1996).

data analysis

for each subject, circular regions of interest (rois)
were placed on different brain areas on the averaged
pet images (obtained between 20 and 40 min after the
injection of [!!cjmtha). the cerebral localization of
rois was done on the basis of the talairach atlas
(talairach and tournaux, 1988). several rois were
grouped to form anatomical-functional regions (ie.
cerebral cortical areas, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebel-
lum, brainstem and white matter). time-activity curves
were obtained for each anatomical-functional region.
both blood and cerebral [!'c]mtha concentrations
were corrected for [!!c] decay, normalized to the
injected dose and expressed as percentage of injected
dose per litre (% id/l). the t/2 of radiotracer elimina-
tion from the brain was calculated using linear regres-
sion analysis of the regional concentration of
radioactivity between 40 and 120 min after tracer
injection. the ratios of radioactivity concentration in
different brain regions relative to that of the cerebral
cortex and white matter were calculated.

results

blood concentration of [''c]jmtha
radioactive concentrations in venous blood peaked at
1.53 40.42 min after the injection, declined rapidly

until 11.0 min and started to increase slightly after that.
this increase corresponds presumably to the emergence
of radiolabelled metabolites formed systemically after
the injection and circulating in the blood (mcnally et
al., 1996). the averaged values were 2.39 + 0.74 at
peak, and 0.43 + 0.09 at 11.0min. the mean blood
kinetics of radioactivity expressed as % id/l are shown
in fig. 1.

kinetics and distribution of (''c]mtha in the brain

radioactive concentrations and kinetics expressed in
%id/l are reported in table 1 and fig. 1. cerebral
radioactivity peaked between 10 and 25 min after the
injection of [!'c]mtha in the brainstem, thalamus,
cerebellum and white matter, and between 25 and
40 min in the putamen and cerebral cortex. the
cerebral clearance of the tracer was faster in the
brainstem than in the remaining brain regions. the t)/2

were: 1.68h in the brainstem, 3.42 h in the cerebral
cortex, 3.05 h in the putamen, 2.75 h in the cerebellum
and 2.44 h in the thalamus.

pet images (averaged 40—70 min after the injection)
revealed a regional distribution of the tracer in favour
of grey matter structures relative to the white matter
(fig. 2).

the radioactive concentrations calculated at peak
and at t = 50—70 min after intravenous injection for the
different brain regions are reported in table 1. at
t=50-70 min the values ranged from 5.07 +
0.55 %id/l in the cortex to 2.4440.14%id/l in
the white matter. little difference was found among
cortical regions. the region/white matter ratios calcu-
lated at t = 50—70 min were 2.38 + 0.24; 2.22 + 0.16;
2.21 + 0.26; 2.08+0.19; and 1.33+0.29 for the
putamen, cerebellum, thalamus, cerebral cortex and
brainstem, respectively. at the same time, the ratios to
the cortex for the putamen, cerebellum, thalamus,
brainstem and white matter were 1.14+ 0.04;
1.07 + 0.03; 1.06+ 0.04; 0.64+40.08; and 0494
0.04, respectively.

no significant correlation was found between the
regional cerebral [!'cjmtha uptake and white matter
ratios at peak or at t=50—70min and the total
quantity of mtha injected to the subjects.

the pet images obtained in one subject 25-35 min
after intravenous injection of [!'c]phy revealed a
regional distribution of the tracer in favour of the
striatum and cerebellum as compared to the cerebral
cortex (fig. 3). at this time, the putamen to cortex ratio
reached 2.03.

activity and blue to the lowest. the pattern of tracer distribution
in the brain appeared differently: the caudate and putamen

highest concentration of ache in these structures. the uptake
of [''c]mtha is homogeneously distributed throughout the grey
matter regions

discussion

tacrine is the first drug to have demonstrated palliative
effects in the treatment of clinical symptoms of ad
patients, but because of its complex pharmacological
profile, it remains unclear which actions are more
relevant to its therapeutic effects. different neuropatho-
logical and/or neurochemical alterations, as well as
differences in drug pharmacokinetics, may account for
the variability of tacrine responsiveness found in pa-
tients with ad. our aim was to visualize in vivo with
pet the cerebral distribution of [''c]mtha in a
normal human brain and to study the regional cerebral
kinetics of the tracer in order to provide a basis for
future application of such methods in clinical investiga-
tions of patients with ad.

[(!'c]mtha rapidly crossed the blood-brain barrier
and, depending on the brain region, reached a peak
between 10 and 40 min after intravenous injection. the
amount of cerebral radioactivity was relatively high
(about 6% of the injected dose/litre) which suggests a
high cerebral/blood extraction (ratio of about 4 at
17 min, 11 at 20 min, and 8 at 65 min). these results
are in agreement with those reported in rats by nielsen
and colleagues (1989) who found [h]tha brain
concentrations eight- to 12-fold in excess of plasma
ee

in vivo pet study of cerebral ['!c] methyltetrahydroaminoacridine distribution and kinetics

levels at between 20 and 120:min. a: similar brain/
blood distribution was observed in rats and baboons
with [!'c]mtha (tavitian et al., 1993).

the cerebral concentration of [!!'c]mtha was high
in the grey matter areas and low in the brainstem and
in the white matter. no differences were found among
the grey matter regions. this cerebral distribution is
close to that previously described in vivo in baboons
(tavitian et al., 1993) with the exception of the
cerebellum. in contrast to baboons, the human cerebel-
lar concentration of [!!'c]mtha reached high values,
close to those of the other cortical and sub-cortical grey
matter regions. different distribution of tha binding
sites in human brain as compared to non-human
primates and/or the interaction between [!!c]mtha
and the anaesthetic compounds used in animal studies
might in part explain this discordance.

after the peak, the radioactivity remained in the
brain and slowly started to decrease in most cerebral
regions with a t)/2 of about 2.5—3 h. the wash-out was
faster in only one region; the brainstem. these results
are also consistent with plasmatic pharmacokinetics of
tha in ad patients (ahlin et al., 1992) and cerebral
pharmacokinetics in rats (mcnally et al., 1989).

overall, our results show that the cerebral retention
of {!'c]mtha is different from that of ache activity
and/or concentration measured in human brains either
postmortem (atack et al., 1986; finkelstein et al.,
1988) or in vivo (pappata et al., 1996) in which the
gradient of cerebral distribution was: caudate-putamen
> cerebellum > cerebral cortex.

the difference between the cerebral distribution of
(!!c]mtha and [!'!c]phy, a selective in vivo ache
marker, is clearly shown in our subject in whom both
radioligands were injected (fig. 3). in this subject,
[!'c]mtha appeared homogeneously distributed with-
in the grey matter regions (putamen to cortex ratio at
t = 50—70 min: 1.10), while [!!'c]phy was mostly con-
centrated in the basal ganglia (putamen to cortex ratio at
t = 30 min: 2.03). this difference cannot be explained
solely by delivery-dependent distribution of the tracer
and/or by high levels of non-specific binding of
[!'c]mtha. in this respect, it should be stressed that
the region to white matter cerebral blood flow (cbf)
ratios are not completely similar to the same ratios
calculated for [!'c]mtha radioactive concentration at
t = 50—70 min (i.e. the brainstem/white matter is 1.99
for cbf and 1.195 for ['!'cjmtha). on the other hand,
although the direct assessment of saturability of
[!'c]mtha cerebral binding sites was not done in this
study in order to avoid undesirable secondary pharmaco-
logical effects in healthy volunteers, the results pre-
viously obtained in baboons suggest the existence of
cerebral [!!'cj]mtha specific binding. we have reported

that in baboons at least 50% of cortical [!!'c]jmtha
could be displaced in vivo by the injection of a large
amount of unlabelled tha (tavitian et al., 1993),
demonstrating a competition between ['!'c]mtha and
tha for the same binding sites. the existence of
saturable cerebral binding sites for (]hjtha was also
reported in rats by mena and desai (1991).

finally, although the metabolites of [''c]mtha
were not directly assessed in the present study, assum-
ing that [''cjmtha metabolites are similar to tha
metabolites, it seems that contamination of cerebral
radioactivity by labelled metabolites can be dismissed.
after administration of a single oral dose of [!4c]tha
in rats (mcnally et al., 1996) 1-hydroxy-tha, the
major metabolite of tha, presents markedly lower
brain levels than tha (ratio of 1:27 at 0.5h and of
1:13 at 2h). as suggested by mcnally and colleagues
(1996), this is probably due, first, to the lack of
biotransformation of tha in the brain and, secondly, to
the more efficient passage of tha through the blood-
brain barrier than 1-hydroxy-tha. concerning the
possible formation of labelled metabolites in the brain,
the same authors reported that in vitro there is no
evidence of ['4c]tha metabolites. thus, we can
assume that tha-metabolite contribution to the overall
brain radioactivity profile can be neglected over the
time period in this study.

the discrepancy between the distribution of cerebral
ache activity and that of [!'cjmtha is intriguing. it
is noteworthy that in large pharmacological doses tha
competes in vivo with ache sites as measured in
baboon brain using ['!c]phy and pet (tavitian et ai.,
1997). however, we would like to suggest that this
apparent discrepancy might reflect, in part, the lack of
selectivity of [''cjmtha for ache binding sites,
especially with the trace doses used in this study.

the widespread spectrum of tha action sites
described by several studies should be placed in
perspective with the brain levels of tha. as estimated
by drukarch and colleagues (1988), clinically active
brain levels were between 0.1 and 1 wm. a similar
brain concentration (>1 ym for the first hour) was
reported by nielsen et al. (1989) following administra-
tion of 3.2 mg/kg in mice and rats. at these levels,
tha interacts not only with ache specific sites (icso,
0.03—0.3 4m, but also with  xxxg248xxx  (icso,
0.007—0.2 4m), muscarinic receptors (icsq, 1-107 ye),
adrenergic receptors (icso, 3.3 um), and histamine-n-
metyltransferase (kj, 35 nm) (for a review see freeman
and dawson, 1991). although the injected [!!'c]mtha
dose in the present study was well below the therapeu-
tic dose for ad patients (range, 18.9—133.8 nmoles), it
is possible that at these trace doses [!!'c]mtha
interacts with some of the previously reported sites.

european journal of neurology 1999, vol6no3 277
finally, the possible existence of an, as yet, unidentified
“tha-binding site’ has been postulated by mena and
desai (mena and desai, 1991) in rat brain. in this
respect, it is noteworthy that the cerebral distribution of
(h]tha (mena and desai, 1991) and [!4c]tha
(mcnally et a/., 1996) in rats is close to that of
(!'cjmtha in animals (tavitian et al., 1993) as well
as in humans, showing highest concentrations in the
grey matter structures and lowest concentrations in the
white matter.

in conclusion, this study shows that the in vivo
cerebral distribution of [''c]mtha in the human
central nervous system does not parallel that of ache.
this is in agreement with previous animal studies and
further suggests that ache is only one of the sites of
actions of tha. future studies might investigate
whether the application of this neuroimaging method
should provide a better understanding of the complex
pharmacological profile of tacrine as well as the drug’s
relevance to the treatment of ad. in particular, it
should be of interest to further define in vivo the
neuronal basis of tha by means of competition studies
with the different potential sites of action of the drug.
finally, the study of ad patients treated with tha
should provide a link between saturation of tha sites
and therapeutic effects.
