abstract
the present study describes the characterization of the binding properties and autoradiographic distribution of a new nonpeptide
antagonist of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors, w3 hxsr 142948a ž2-w5-ž2,6-dimethoxyphenyl.-1-ž4-ž n-ž3-dimethylaminopropyl.-n-methylcarbamoyl.-2-isopropylphenyl.-1h- xxxd3045xxx -3-carbonylx-amino4-adamantane-2-carboxylic acid, hydrochloride., in the rat brain. the
binding of w3 hxsr 142948a in brain membrane homogenates was specific, time-dependent, reversible and saturable. w3 hxsr 142948a
bound to an apparently homogeneous population of sites, with a k d of 3.5 nm and a bmax value of 508 fmolrmg of protein, which was
80% higher than that observed in saturation experiments with w3 hxneurotensin. w3 hxsr 142948a binding was inhibited by sr 142948a,
the related nonpeptide receptor antagonist, sr 48692 ž2-w1-ž7-chloroquinolin-4-yl.-5-ž2,6-dimethoxyphenyl.-1h- xxxd3045xxx -3carbonylxamino4-adamantane-2-carboxylic acid. and  xxxg1618xxx . saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the
histamine h 1 receptor antagonist,  xxxd2469xxx , revealed that w3 hxsr 142948a bound with similar affinities to both the  xxxd2469xxx -insensitive  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptors ž20% of the total binding population. and the recently cloned  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive  xxxg1618xxx  nt2
receptors ž80% of the receptors. ž k d s 6.8 and 4.8 nm, respectively.. the regional distribution of w3 hxsr 142948a binding in the rat
brain closely matched the distribution of w125 ixneurotensin binding. in conclusion, these findings indicate that w3 hxsr 142948a is a new
potent antagonist radioligand which recognizes with high affinity both  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors and represents thus an
excellent tool to study  xxxg1618xxx  receptors in the rat brain. q 1998 elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
 xxxg1618xxx  is a 13-amino acid neuropeptide found in
the central nervous system and peripheral tissues of numerous mammalian species žemson et al., 1982; mai et al.,
1987 ..  xxxg1618xxx  acts as a neurotransmitter–
neuromodulator in a variety of physiological processes. in
particular,  xxxg1618xxx  has been shown to play an important role in the modulation of midbrain dopamine transmission žkasckow and nemeroff, 1991.;  xxxg1618xxx  is also
involved in nociception, hypothermia and control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion žrostene
` and alexander,
1997.. in the adult rat and mouse brain,  xxxg1618xxx  can
bind to two different binding sites which can be distinguished by their affinity for  xxxg1618xxx  žmazella et al.,

1983., as well as by their sensitivity to  xxxd2469xxx , a
histamine h 1 receptor antagonist žschotte et al., 1986.. in
other species, including humans, rabbits and guinea pigs,
only  xxxd2469xxx -insensitive sites have been detected in
the brain žschotte et al., 1986.. until recently, it was
believed that the physiological effects of  xxxg1618xxx  were
mediated through a single class of g protein-coupled
receptors, corresponding to the  xxxd2469xxx -insensitive
binding sites, cloned from rat brain žtanaka et al., 1990.
and human adenocarcinoma ht-29 cell line žvita et al.,
1993.. in contrast, it was assumed that  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive  xxxg1618xxx  binding sites lacked signalling activity and
were thus considered as acceptor sites, devoid of function.
very recently, however, a novel  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
žcalled nt2 . sensitive to  xxxd2469xxx  was cloned in the
rat hypothalamus žchalon et al., 1996. and mouse brain
žmazella et al., 1996.. it also belongs to the family of g
protein-coupled receptors and has about 40% homology

with the previously cloned rat and human  xxxg1618xxx 
receptors žnt1 .. the biological function of the  xxxg1618xxx 
nt2 receptor remains to be determined.
a major advancement in the field of  xxxg1618xxx  research was provided by the discovery of the first highly
potent and selective nonpeptide  xxxg1618xxx  receptor antagonist, sr 48692 žgully et al., 1993.. sr 48692 is orally
active, crosses the blood brain barrier and has a long-lasting action; it shows higher affinity for  xxxg1618xxx  nt1
than for nt2 receptors. this antagonist can counteract the
effects of  xxxg1618xxx  in numerous in vitro and in vivo
assays žgully et al., 1993.; however, sr 48692 is unable
to inhibit  xxxg1618xxx -induced hypothermia and analgesia
in rats and mice ždubuc et al., 1994.. this compound also
fails to reverse dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens
evoked by  xxxg1618xxx  injection in the ventral tegmental
area žsteinberg et al., 1994., as well as the hypolocomotion induced by intracerebroventricular administration of
the peptide žpugsley et al., 1995.. these findings suggest
that these effects of  xxxg1618xxx  could be mediated through
a  xxxg1618xxx  receptor subtype which is insensitive to sr
48692 žle et al., 1996..
although sr 48692 has proved an important pharmacological tool for studying  xxxg1618xxx  receptors and for
exploring the existence of possible  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
subtypes, it has certain properties that could limit its
usefulness. in particular, sr 48692 has very low aqueous
solubility and 100 times lower affinity for the rat brain
when compared to the guinea pig brain žgully et al.,
1993.. thus, the tritiated ligand derived from this antagonist, w3 hxsr 48692, bound with high affinity to the guinea
pig brain ž k d s 2 nm. žbetancur et al., 1995. and to cells
transfected with the rat  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptor ž k d s 3
nm. žlabbe-jullie
´
´ et al., 1995., but exhibited high levels
of nonspecific binding when tested in adult rat brain
homogenates or sections žunpublished observation..
recently, sanofi developed a second nonpeptide antagonist of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors, sr 142948a, which is
chemically related to sr 48692 but has better solubility
and increased affinity in the rat brain žgully et al., 1997..
sr 142948a recognizes with similar affinity žin the
nanomolar range. both  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors
žgully et al., 1997.. interestingly, in contrast to sr 48692,
sr 142948a blocked the hypothermia and analgesia induced by central injection of  xxxg1618xxx , revealing a
wider spectrum of action, probably through inhibition of
different  xxxg1618xxx  receptor subtypes žgully et al., 1997..
in the present study, we examined the binding properties of a newly developed tritiated form of sr 142948a
žw3 hxsr 142948a. in adult rat brain membrane homogenates. furthermore, we studied the autoradiographic
distribution of w3 hxsr 142948a binding sites in the rat
brain and compared it with that of w125 ixneurotensin binding. w3 hxsr 142948a binding was studied in the presence
or absence of  xxxd2469xxx , in order to determine its
binding properties to  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors.

louis, mo., 5 mm dithiothreitol and 40 mgrl bacitracin
and stored as aliquots in liquid nitrogen until used.
2.3. binding assays in brain homogenates
aliquots of brain membranes ž300 m grassay. were
incubated in 0.5 ml žfinal volume. of binding assay buffer
containing the appropriate concentrations of w3 hxsr
142948a and unlabeled drugs. after incubation at 208c for
60 min, the assay medium was diluted with 4 ml of
ice-cold 50 mm tris–hcl buffer žph 7.4. and filtered
rapidly under reduced pressure through whatman glassfiber gfrb filters pretreated with 0.1% polyethylenimine.
the filters were washed 3 times under the same conditions
and transferred to vials containing 4 ml of scintillation
cocktail. the bound radioactivity was determined by liquid
scintillation counting. nonspecific binding was determined
in the presence of 1 m m unlabeled sr 142948a.
saturation experiments were carried out with increasing
concentrations of w3 hxsr 142948a ž0.05 to 16 nm.. in
association kinetic experiments, rat brain homogenates
were incubated with w3 hxsr 142948a ž2 nm. for various
time periods. for dissociation studies, w3 hxsr 142948a
was incubated for 30 min with brain membranes, unlabeled
sr 142948a was then added at a final concentration of 1
m m and incubations were stopped at the indicated times.
competition studies were conducted with a single concentration of w3 hxsr 142948a ž2 nm. and at least 10 concentrations of unlabeled ligands. in addition, saturation and
competition studies with w3 hxsr 142948a were performed
in the presence of a constant concentration of  xxxd2469xxx  ž10 m m., which selectively inhibits binding to  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors. the effect of guanyl nucleotides
on w3 hxsr 142948a binding was examined by adding
increasing concentrations of the nonhydrolyzable gtp analog 5x-guanylylimidodiphosphate žgppžnh.p. to the binding assay. w3 hxneurotensin binding to rat brain membranes
was performed as described previously žgoedert et al.,
1984., in the presence or absence of  xxxd2469xxx  ž10
m m.. nonspecific binding was determined by incubation
with 1 m m  xxxg1618xxx . all experiments were performed 2
or 3 times in triplicate. data from association, saturation
and competition studies were analyzed by using a nonlinear regression program, ligand žmunson and rodbard,
1980.. k i values were calculated according to the cheng
and prusoff ž1973. equation.
2.4. autoradiography of [3h]sr 142948a binding sites
adult male rats were killed by decapitation, the brain
was removed rapidly, frozen on dry ice and stored at
y808c. coronal sections ž20 m m thick. were cut on a
cryostat at y168c, mounted on slides žsuperfrost plus,
menzel-glaser, madison, wi. and stored at y208c until
used. w3 hxsr 142948a binding was performed by incubating the sections for 60 min at room temperature with 300
m l of 2 nm w3 hxsr 142948a in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer

žph 7.4., containing 1 mm edta, 0.1% bovine serum
albumin, 40 mgrml bacitracin and 0.5 mm 1,10 orthophenanthroline, in the presence or absence of 1 m m
 xxxd2469xxx . additional sections were incubated with 10
m m sr 142948a for the determination of nonspecific
binding. after incubation, the sections were washed 3
times for 10 min each at 48c in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer
žph 7.4., containing 1 mm edta and 0.1% bovine serum
albumin. slides were then dipped briefly in distilled water
and dried under a stream of air. sections were placed in
x-ray cassettes, apposed to hyperfilm-3 h žamersham,
france. for 3 weeks and developed by standard photographic procedures.
2.5. autoradiography of [125i x  xxxg1618xxx  binding sites
w125 ixneurotensin binding was performed as described
previously žmoyse et al., 1987.. briefly, slide-mounted
brain sections were incubated for 60 min at 48c with 300
m l of 0.3 nm w125 ixneurotensin in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer
žph 7.4., containing 5 mm mgcl 2 , 0.2% bovine serum
albumin and 0.5 mm 1,10 orthophenanthroline, in the
presence or absence of 1 m m  xxxd2469xxx . nonspecific
binding was determined in the presence of 10 m m unlabeled  xxxg1618xxx . the sections were washed 4 times for 2
min each at 48c in 40 mm tris–hcl buffer žph 7.4.,
dipped briefly in distilled water and dried. radiolabeled
sections were exposed to hyperfilm-b max žamersham.
for 1 week.
2.6. densitometric analysis
quantitative optical density measurements of film autoradiographs were carried out with a computer-based image
analysis system žhisto-rag, biocom, les ulis, france..
optical densities of nonspecific binding were subtracted
from total binding to obtain specific binding. measurements were performed bilaterally on 4 brain sections per
level. values were expressed as ncirmg tissue by using
autoradiographic 3 h and 125 i micro-scales žamersham.
that were exposed together with the tissue sections. brain
structures were identified according to the atlas of paxinos
and watson ž1986..

the addition of increasing concentrations of  xxxd2469xxx  to the w3 hxsr 142948a binding assay resulted in
progressive blockade of  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors žfig.
6.. concentrations greater than 1 m m  xxxd2469xxx  completely inhibited the binding of w3 hxsr 142948a to nt2
receptors, which constituted 80% of the whole population
of sites. the presence of 10 m m  xxxd2469xxx  in the
w3 hxsr 142948a binding assay revealed  xxxg1618xxx  nt1

that w3 hxsr 142948a exhibits similar affinities for the two
subtypes of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors. similar experiments
performed with w3 hxneurotensin žfig. 7b. revealed k d
values comparable to those of w3 hx sr 142948a ž6.8 and
4.8 nm for nt1 and nt2 receptors, respectively.. however, w3 hxneurotensin bound to a lower number of binding
sites than w3 hxsr 142948a ž bmax values of 32 and 265
fmolrmg for nt1 and nt2 receptors, respectively..
3.1.6. effect of guanyl nucleotides on [3h]sr 142948a
binding
in order to determine whether the binding of w3 hxsr
142948a was sensitive to guanyl nucleotides, we examined the affinity of the radioligand in the presence of

73

gppžnh.p, a nonhydrolyzable analog of gtp. the addition of gppžnh.p in concentrations up to 100 m m did not
modify the specific binding of w3 hxsr 142948a to rat
brain membranes ždata not shown..
3.2. autoradiographic localization of [3h]sr 142948a
binding sites in the rat brain: comparison with [125i x  xxxg1618xxx  binding
preliminary experiments showed that the characteristics
of w3 hxsr 142948a binding to rat midbrain sections were
similar to those observed for brain membrane homogenates. w3 hxsr 142948a binding was saturable and

w3 hxsr 142948a and w125 ixneurotensin specific binding to  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors was determined on rat brain sections by autoradiography, in
the presence žq levo. or absence žy levo. of  xxxd2469xxx  ž1 m m.. the occlusion of  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors by  xxxd2469xxx  allowed detection of
nt1 receptors. the difference between binding in the absence and in the presence of  xxxd2469xxx  represents binding to nt2 receptors. optical densities
were measured bilaterally on 4 brain sections per level and expressed as mean " s.e.m. ncirmg tissue.

determined with 2 nm radioligand. analysis of competition studies performed on rat midbrain sections showed
that sr 142948a, sr 48692 and  xxxg1618xxx  induced a
dose-dependent and complete inhibition of w3 hxsr
142948a binding ždata not shown..
fig. 8 shows the regional distribution of w3 hxsr
142948a and w125 ixneurotensin binding sites in the rat
brain. the highest density of w3 hxsr 142948a and
w125 ixneurotensin binding was present in the midbrain, in
the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta. intense labeling was also observed in the perirhinal
area as well as in the dorsal peduncular, anterior cingulate
and agranular insular cortices, posteromedial cortical
amygdaloid nucleus, medial habenula and ventral dentate
gyrus. the endopiriform nucleus, septohippocampal nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus and zona incerta exhibited moderate levels of binding. finally, a low density of
binding sites was observed in the frontal, parietal, temporal
and retrosplenial granular cortices, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and in the superficial
gray layer of the superior colliculus.
table 1 shows the comparative distribution of w3 hxsr
142948a and w125 ixneurotensin binding sites in the rat
brain, in the presence or absence of  xxxd2469xxx . an
excellent correlation between the regional distribution of
the two ligands was observed, in agreement with the
autoradiographic localization of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors in
rat brain described previously žmoyse et al., 1987.. the
presence of  xxxd2469xxx  in the incubation buffer inhibited
binding to  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors and decreased the
amount of labeling with w3 hxsr 142948a and w125 ixneurotensin in all brain regions studied, indicating that both
ligands labeled  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors. this
result is in agreement with the ubiquitous distribution of
nt2 receptors in the rat brain žschotte et al., 1986..

4. discussion
the binding of the nonpeptide  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
antagonist w3 hxsr 142948a to rat brain membranes was
rapid, tissue concentration and time dependent, saturable
and reversible. scatchard analyses of saturation experiments indicated that w3 hxsr 142948a binds with high
affinity ž k d s 3.5 nm. and apparently recognizes a single
class of binding sites. the number of sites labeled by
w3 hxsr 142948a ž bmax s 508 fmolrmg protein. was 80%
greater than the bmax value determined with w3 hxneurotensin under the same experimental conditions ž297
fmolrmg protein.. competition experiments with unlabeled sr 142948a yielded a hill coefficient near unity,
further suggesting that the antagonist bound to an apparently homogeneous population of binding sites.
the potencies of the  xxxg1618xxx  receptor antagonists
sr 142948a and sr 48692 in inhibiting specific w3 hxsr

142948a binding ž k i s 5 and 123.6 nm, respectively.
were similar to their previously reported potencies in
displacing w125 ixneurotensin binding in adult rat brain homogenates žic 50 s 3.96 and 82 nm for sr 142948a and
sr 48692, respectively. žgully et al., 1997.. in contrast,
the potency of the natural peptide agonist  xxxg1618xxx  for
inhibiting w3 hxsr 142948a binding ž k i s 32.8 nm. was
10-fold lower than its potency in displacing w125 ixneurotensin binding žic 50 s 3.2 nm.. this is consistent with
results obtained with other receptor systems, demonstrating
that estimates of agonist affinity are lower when an antagonist rather than an agonist radioligand is displaced. indeed,
a reduced potency for agonists to compete against radiolabeled antagonist ligands has been observed previously for
 xxxg1618xxx  receptors in the guinea pig brain žbetancur et
al., 1995., as well as for muscarinic cholinergic receptors
žwaelbroeck et al., 1982., cholecystokinin cck a žchang
et al., 1986; talkad et al., 1994. and cck b receptors
žchang et al., 1989., tachykinin nk 1 receptors žmclean et
al., 1991. and 5-ht2 receptors žteitler et al., 1990.. these
findings have been interpreted as indicating the existence
of different conformational states of the same receptor,
with different affinities for agonist and antagonist ligands
žschwartz et al., 1995..
the higher number of receptors detected with w3 hxsr
142948a when compared with the number detected with
the agonist radioligand, w3 hxneurotensin, also supports this
hypothesis. the ability of radiolabeled nonpeptide antagonists to recognize a larger number of receptors, characterized by low affinity for the agonist, than agonist-derived
radioligands appears to be a common phenomenon. for
instance, we showed previously that in the guinea pig brain
the number of binding sites labeled by the antagonist
w3 hxsr 48692 exceeded by 20-fold the number of receptors labeled with the agonist w125 ixneurotensin žbetancur et
al., 1995.. the binding sites detected by w3 hxsr 48692
were characterized by a low affinity for  xxxg1618xxx  and
were insensitive to gtp, suggesting that they represent the
uncoupled form of the  xxxg1618xxx  receptor. these data,
together with current hypotheses on the molecular interactions of ligands with their receptors, suggest that agonists
bind with high affinity to the active receptor conformation,
whereas antagonists bind with higher affinity to the inactive conformation žschwartz et al., 1995.. thus, peptide
agonists and nonpeptide antagonists act as allosteric competitive ligands by binding in a mutually exclusive fashion
to sites occurring in different receptor conformations. in
support of this model, recent site-directed mutational studies of the rat  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptor showed that mutations in the n-terminal part eliminate  xxxg1618xxx  binding
without affecting the binding of w3 hxsr 48692 žlabbe-jul´
lie´ et al., 1995.. this finding suggests the existence of
distinct agonist and antagonist binding domains on the
 xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptor, similarly to what has been reported for several other neuropeptide receptors žfor review,
see betancur et al., 1997..

c. betancur et al.r european journal of pharmacology 343 (1998) 67–77

 xxxd2469xxx  is a nonpeptide antagonist of histamine
h 1 receptors that is structurally unrelated to  xxxg1618xxx 
žstockbroekx et al., 1986., but binds also to  xxxg1618xxx 
nt2 receptors žschotte et al., 1986.. the recent cloning of
the mouse nt2 receptor and its expression in xenopus
oocytes indicated that  xxxd2469xxx  acts as an agonist in
this system, since it triggers a cly inward current, as does
 xxxg1618xxx  žmazella et al., 1996.. saturation and competition experiments performed with or without  xxxd2469xxx 
indicated that w3 hxsr 142948a bound with high affinity to
 xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and nt2 receptors ž k d s 3.4 and 8.5 nm,
respectively.. indeed, the addition of  xxxd2469xxx  to the
w3 hxsr 142948a binding assay caused a parallel leftward
shift of the scatchard plot, indicating the displacement of
w3 hxsr 142948a binding from  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive nt2
receptors. the similar affinity of w3 hxsr 142948a for both
subtypes of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors explains the apparently
homogeneous population of binding sites detected with
this ligand in the absence of  xxxd2469xxx . moreover, our
results indicate that  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors constitute
80% of the whole population of sites labeled by w3 hxsr
142948a ž bmax s 104 and 422 fmolrmg protein for nt1
and nt2 receptors, respectively. on rat brain membranes.
guanyl nucleotides differentially affect agonist and antagonist binding in several neurotransmitter receptor systems. accordingly, guanyl nucleotides have been reported
to significantly reduce w125 ixneurotensin binding to nt1
receptors, by interfering with the formation of the high-affinity agonist-receptor-g protein ternary complex žhermans et al., 1996.. in contrast, the present study showed
that addition of gppžnh.p had no effect on specific
w3 hxsr 142948a binding. this finding is consistent with
previous data showing that antagonist ligands bind with
high affinity to the g protein-uncoupled state of receptors
žteitler et al., 1990; rosenkilde et al., 1994; betancur et
al., 1995.. it should be noted, however, that the  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive  xxxg1618xxx  binding site is insensitive to
gtp žvincent, 1995., although recent data indicate that the
cloned mouse  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptor is coupled functionally to phospholipase c when expressed in oocytes
žmazella et al., 1996.. other studies have shown that an
absence of gtp-sensitive binding does not necessarily
indicate failure to activate a second messenger cascade
žchung et al., 1988; maeda et al., 1990; hermans et al.,
1996..
the different sensitivity to gppžnh.p of  xxxg1618xxx 
nt1 and nt2 receptors is particularly interesting in view
of the fact that the lowest homology between the two
 xxxg1618xxx  receptors is in their third cytoplasmic loop and
c-terminal domain žchalon et al., 1996; mazella et al.,
1996., two regions implicated in the coupling to g proteins
žyamada et al., 1994; hermans et al., 1996.. furthermore,
it has been proposed that the extremely high number of
serrthr residues in the third intracytoplasmic loop and the
c-terminal domain of the  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptor protein
could be associated with a basal phosphorylated state

75

resulting in desensitization of the receptor žmazella et al.,
1996.. this could result in a higher proportion of receptors
in the uncoupled form expressed in the membrane and
might explain the insensitivity of the nt2 receptor to gtp
analogs. the use of recently developed radiolabeled agonist ligands specific for the g protein-coupled state of
 xxxg1618xxx  receptors žgaudriault et al., 1996., in the
presence or absence of  xxxd2469xxx , could help to determine the different states of coupling of  xxxg1618xxx  nt1
and nt2 receptors.
the autoradiographic distribution of w3 hxsr 142948a
binding in sections of rat brain was consistent with its
selective binding to  xxxg1618xxx  receptors. the heterogeneous pattern of specific w3 hxsr 142948a binding closely
matched the localization of w125 ixneurotensin binding observed in adjacent sections. the addition of  xxxd2469xxx 
to the incubation buffer resulted in a small and diffuse
reduction of w3 hxsr 142948a and w125 ixneurotensin binding in all brain structures studied, in agreement with
previous studies indicating that  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors
are distributed throughout the rat central nervous system
žschotte et al., 1986; kitabgi et al., 1987. and are predominantly associated with glial cells žschotte et al., 1988.. the
ubiquitous distribution of  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptors contrasts with the highly regional localization of nt1 receptors in the brain. indeed, nt1 receptors are particularly
abundant in brain regions rich in dopamine neurons, such
as the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area, as
well as in certain cortical areas. these results are in
agreement with the previously described distribution of
w125 ixneurotensin binding žmoyse et al., 1987. and  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptor mrna žnicot et al., 1994. observed
in the rat brain.
the functional characterization of the actions of sr
142948a in the central nervous system showed that this
compound, like the first-generation  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
antagonist sr 48692, antagonizes the turning behavior
induced by intrastriatal injection of  xxxg1618xxx  in mice as
well as acetylcholine release evoked by  xxxg1618xxx  in the
striatum žgully et al., 1993, 1997.. neither compound
modified dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after
injection of  xxxg1618xxx  into the ventral tegmental area
žsteinberg et al., 1994; gully et al., 1997.. however,
unlike sr 48692, sr 142948a blocked the hypothermia
and analgesia induced by central injection of  xxxg1618xxx 
in rodents žgully et al., 1997.. these results suggest that
sr 142948a may interact with a  xxxg1618xxx  receptor
subtype which is not blocked by sr 48692. it would be
interesting to assess the potential involvement of the recently identified  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptor in the mediation
of the hypothermia and anti-nociceptive effects induced by
 xxxg1618xxx .
in conclusion, w3 hxsr 142948a represents a new potent
nonpeptide antagonist radioligand specific for  xxxg1618xxx 
receptors. the compound binds to rat  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 and
nt2 receptors with nanomolar affinity, close to that of the

76

c. betancur et al.r european journal of pharmacology 343 (1998) 67–77

natural ligand  xxxg1618xxx . the ligand previously described, w3 hxsr 48692, exhibits a higher affinity for nt1
than for nt2 receptors and has a low ratio of total binding
to nonspecific binding in rat brain membranes and tissue
sections, which limits its utility. consequently, the availability of w3 hxsr 142948a provides a valuable tool for the
study of  xxxg1618xxx  receptors in the central nervous system.
