abstract
among various hypotheses put forth to account for the etiology of schizophrenia, the abnormal function of serotonergic system has
recently gained marked interest. our previous study showed that drug-free schizophrenic patients had a significant increase in maximum
numbers (bmax ) of platelet 5-ht2a receptors that declined to normal level after treatment with different neuroleptic drugs. to elucidate the
role of the serotonin system in schizophrenia, the serotonin transporters on human platelets were examined in this study. platelet serotonin
transporters obtained from normal control subjects and schizophrenic patients were identified by using [3 h]imipramine as the radioligand
and fluoxetine to define the non-specific binding. the data showed that the mean bmax of serotonin transporter sites for schizophrenic patients
without neuroleptic therapy was significantly higher than in normal controls. the bmax values for schizophrenic patients on phenothiazine,
butyrophenone, thioxanthene and serotonin-dopamine antagonist (sda) therapies were significantly lower than the bmax values obtained
from schizophrenic patients without neuroleptic therapy, and were comparable to those found in normal control subjects. the dissociation
equilibrium constant (kd ) values in all subject groups remained unchanged. the effect of various medication periods on platelet serotonin
transporters was also studied. we found that, bmax values of 1–4 weeks, 1–4 months, 4–12 months and >1 year of neuroleptic therapies were
significantly decreased when compared with the unmedicated group. significant reduction of brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) occurred
in all types of neuroleptics and every period of drug treatments compared with the unmedicated group. the present results indicate that
alteration of platelet serotonin transporters is associated with schizophrenia. treatment with various types of neuroleptics suppresses the
hypersensitivity of platelet serotonin transporters. the mechanisms of how neuroleptics achieve their therapeutic effects, whether they act
via or modulate serotonin system in certain brain area, still need to be further evaluated. © 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder, which usually starts in adolescence or early adult life, and often becomes chronic and disabling (warner and de girolamo,
1995). about 1% of people is afflicted with schizophrenia
during their lifetime. most cases have an effect on all aspects
of human thought, emotion and expression. treatments do
not cure the disease, but they can significantly reduce symptoms and reduce the relapse rate by >50%.
the cause of the disease is still unknown. there have
been many hypotheses about schizophrenia, one of which
is that the disease is caused by a neurochemical imbalance

(ashton, 1992). the dopamine hypothesis has dominated
schizophrenia research since the mid-1960s and serotonin
has been implicated in a variety of behaviors and somatic
functions which are disturbed in schizophrenia. since serotonin has been implicated in a broad range of behaviors
including locomotion, feeding, mood and anxiety, considerable research has been conducted in an attempt to determine
the mechanisms by which serotonin functions.
over the last decade, the human blood platelet, which is
a neuroectodermal derivative, has emerged as a peripheral
model for the study of the transporter, storage, metabolism,
and release of serotonin by serotonergic nerve ending
(stahl, 1977). because of biochemical and morphological
similarities between blood platelets and cns serotonin
synaptosomes, and because of data suggesting that virtually all serotonin in blood is associated with the platelet

(yuwiler et al., 1981), platelets have been widely used as a
good model of studying serotonin function.
the earliest studies to examine serotonin in schizophrenia
looked at peripheral measures, such as serotonin concentrations in plasma and uptake in platelets. these studies found
increased concentrations in plasma and, less consistently,
reduced uptake in platelets. studies of csf metabolites have
been mixed and varied and suffer from the same methodological confounds described for dopamine. more direct
measures of central neurotransmission include post-mortem
assays of serotonin activity, including concentrations in
brain tissue, receptor-binding density, re-uptake site binding, levels of mrna for receptor subtypes, re-uptake sites,
and synthetic enzymes for serotonin itself (egan and hyde,
2000). our previous study in platelet  xxxg1113xxx  in
schizophrenic patients with and without neuroleptic therapy
showed that drug-free schizophrenic patients had a significant increase in bmax of 5-ht2a receptors. the expression
of 5-ht2a receptors on these platelets declined to normal level after treatment with different neuroleptic drugs
(govitrapong et al., 2000). it was, therefore, crucial to investigate whether these changes were due to the adaptation
of platelet serotonin transporter. since serotonin transporters
on platelets share similar pharmacological properties with
neuronal serotonin transporters (lesch et al., 1993), it was
considered that they may provide a useful model system
for the study of psychiatric disorders. the objective of this
study was to investigate the human platelet serotonin transporter in schizophrenic patients with and without different
neuroleptic treatment by using [3 h]imipramine as a radioligand. knowledge gained through this study would enhance
our understanding of the role of serotonin in schizophrenia, which may then be used as a basis for selecting the
most appropriate antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of
schizophrenic patients.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
[3 h]imipramine (specific activity, 20–23 ci/mmol), was
purchased from amersham international inc. (buckinghamshire, uk). fluoxetine was purchased from research
biochemical international (natick, ma, usa). all other
chemicals used were purchased from e. merck (darmstadt,
germany) and sigma chemical company (st. louis, mo,
usa). the solutions containing drugs were freshly prepared
for each experiment.
2.2. subjects
forty-two schizophrenic patients diagnosed according
to dsm iv criteria (american psychiatric association,
1994) from the psychiatric clinic, wachira hospital were
recruited for this study after having given informed consent.

this study was approved by the mahidol university ethics
committee and performed in accordance with ethical
standards laid down in the 1964 declaration of helsinki.
complete medical and family histories were obtained from
the patients and informants (when available). all subjects
were assessed in their behavior using the brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) (overall, 1962). schizophrenic
patients were composed of five groups. one group comprised unmedicated patients (4 males and 2 females) who
never received any neuroleptic medication before blood
sampling, while the other four groups were in receipt
of different neuroleptic drug treatments. sixteen patients
(10 males and 6 females) received phenothiazines (perphenazine, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine or thioridazine),
9 patients (5 males and 4 females) received butyrophenones
(haloperidol, haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  or bromperidol), 6 patients (6 males) received thioxanthenes ( xxxd2137xxx  or
 xxxd2137xxx   xxxd1821xxx ) and 5 patients (5 females) received serotonin-dopamine antagonists (olanzapine or quetiapine). the criteria for neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic
patients were that they had not been treated with antidepressant drugs. all healthy adults were recruited as a control
group. they had no history of neurological or psychiatric
illness, including no seriously infectious diseases such
as hiv/aids or hepatitis; they were drug-free and were
matched with the schizophrenic patients for age and sex.
2.3. preparation of platelet membranes
blood (15–20 ml) was withdrawn from an antecubital vein
into plastic tubes containing sodium citrate (0.38% final concentration) as the anticoagulant. platelet was obtained by
centrifugation of the blood sample at 200×g for 20 min in an
iec model hn-s centrifuge, at room temperature. platelet
was isolated and diluted with half of its original volume of
an ice-cold 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), and homogenized for
15 s with a tissue homogenizer (ultra turrax t25) setting at
a moderate speed (13,500 rpm). the suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 ◦ c in a refrigerated
centrifuge (doupont, sorvall rc26 plus). the supernatant
was decanted and the membrane pellet was re-suspended in
20 volumes of 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), homogenized and
centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. the supernatant was
discarded and the final membrane pellet was kept frozen at
−80 ◦ c until used, usually within 2 weeks.
2.4. [3 h ]imipramine binding assay
binding of [3 h]imipramine to platelet membranes was
determined according to a technique modified from biegon
et al. (1987) as follows: the membrane pellets were
re-suspended in 5 ml of ice cold 50 mm tris–hcl salt
buffer, ph 7.5 (containing 120 mm nacl; 5 mm kcl; 2 mm
cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2 ) and homogenized for 15 s with
a homogenizer (ultra turrax t25) setting at a moderate
speed (13,500 rpm). the [3 h]imipramine binding assays

p. govitrapong et al. / neurochemistry international 41 (2002) 209–216

were performed by the addition of 400 ␮l platelet membrane suspension (to give a final protein concentration of
0.2–0.4 mg/ml) into plastic tubes, which contained 50 ␮l
incubation buffer either with or without 10 ␮m fluoxetine
in the buffer. the reactions were started by adding 50 ␮l of
[3 h]imipramine to give a final concentration of 0.1–4 nm
in a final incubation volume of 0.5 ml. the assay mixtures
were incubated at 0 ◦ c for 60 min, during which time binding equilibrium was reached. the reaction was terminated
by rapidly filtering the reaction mixture through whatman
gf/b filters under vacuum. the filters were washed twice
with 3 ml of ice cold 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.5),
dried and the transporter-bound radioactivity trapped on
the filters was counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid by a
scintillation spectrometry counter (beckman ls 1800). the
specific [3 h]imipramine binding accounted for 40–60% of
the total binding.
2.5. determination of protein
the concentration of protein in the platelet membranes
was determined by the method of bradford (bradford, 1976),
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
2.6. analysis of data
saturation curves were analyzed by the non-linear leastsquared regression analysis computer program, ligand
(munson and rodbard, 1980). bmax and kd were obtained.
the data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. derived from
n-experiments, as indicated. statistical evaluation of the result was performed by using analysis of variance (anova)
and the tukey–kramer multiple comparison test.

the kd and bmax values of [3 h]imipramine binding
and also the bprs scores of normal control subjects and
schizophrenic patients are shown in table 1. this study
indicated significantly (p < 0.001) higher bmax values
of [3 h]imipramine binding to the blood platelets of unmedicated schizophrenic patients, compared with normal
control subjects (1557 ± 183 and 751 ± 39 fmol/mg protein, respectively). the bmax values in schizophrenic patients on phenothiazine, butyrophenone, thioxanthene or
serotonin-dopamine antagonist medications (833 ± 114,
879 ± 87, 747 ± 151, 736 ± 135 fmol/mg protein, respectively), were significantly lower (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001),
compared with the unmedicated group (1557 ± 183),
however, they were comparable to values in the control
group. comparison of bmax values in platelets according to
gender or age showed no significant difference. the kd values were not significantly altered in any group in this study.

of bprs scores of unmedicated schizophrenic patients compared with normal control subjects. the scores from four
neuroleptic-treated groups were significantly (p < 0.001)
lower than in the unmedicated group. significant clinical
improvement occurred in all types of neuroleptic-treated patients. on the other hand, no significant difference was found
among different types of neuroleptic treatments. there was
no significant correlation between the bprs scores and
the number of blood platelet [3 h]imipramine binding sites
(bmax ), neither among each individual type of neuroleptic
treatments nor the total population of schizophrenic patients.

schizophrenic patients are shown in table 2. within 1 month
of neuroleptic therapy, the bmax values (865 ± 124 fmol/mg
protein) were significantly decreased (p < 0.01) from those
of unmedicated schizophrenic patients (1557 ± 183 fmol/mg
protein). after that time, the bmax values were also significantly decreased (p < 0.001 in the 1–4 months, and
p < 0.01 in 4–12 months and >1 year groups; bmax values
were 706 ± 83, 615 ± 113 and 923 ± 115 fmol/mg protein,
respectively) when compared with unmedicated subjects.
the degree of decrease in bmax values was highest in the

kd values of platelet serotonin transporter in schizophrenic
patients in relation to the duration of medication found that
there was no significant difference between any group of

7.30 ± 0.68, 5.80 ± 1.86 and 7.25 ± 1.15, respectively.
the scores from four duration periods of neuroleptic treated
groups were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than in unmedicated group. however, there was no significant difference
among different duration of neuroleptic treatments. significance in clinical improvement occurred in all different duration treatments in this study.

4. discussion
4.1. platelet serotonin transporters in unmedicated
schizophrenic patients
the present data showed that the maximum number of
serotonin transporter sites (bmax ) was significantly higher
in the blood platelets of unmedicated schizophrenic patients
compared with normal control subjects. this result was comparable to several previous reports. for example, desmedt
et al. (1987) found that the maximal [3 h]imipramine binding sites in platelets of schizophrenic patients was higher

than that found in normal control subjects, and there was no
significant difference in the kd values between these groups.
in the study of post-mortem brains of schizophrenics, joyce
et al. (1993) reported a large increase in the number of 5-ht
uptake sites in all striatal regions in schizophrenic patients.
they also noted a marked increase in the dorsal striatum
of schizophrenic patients, but not in the motor cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus. in contrast, marazziti et al.
(1989) and rotman et al. (1982) found a significant reduction of maximum binding capacity (bmax ) and kd value
in their schizophrenic group compared with healthy controls, however, some of the patients in their studies were
receiving neuroleptic drugs. in contrast, wood et al. (1983),
gentsch et al. (1985) and weizman et al. (1987) failed to
find any significant difference in platelet [3 h]imipramine
binding between schizophrenic patients and normal controls.
dean et al. (1996) reported no difference in either kd or
bmax of [3 h]paroxetine (a selective serotonin transporter inhibitor) binding in frontal cortex or caudate nucleus from
schizophrenic and normal subjects. similarly, there was no
difference between the density of [3 h]paroxetine binding
to hippocampus of schizophrenic and normal subjects, but
there was a significant increased in kd values. dean et al.
(1999) also found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from
subjects with schizophrenia that there was no alteration in
the density of serotonin transporter compared with normal
controls.
in general, the increase in serotonin transporter binding
sites leads to an increase in 5-ht re-uptake, and results
in the induction of 5-ht levels in pre-synaptic serotonin
terminals and the reduction of 5-ht levels in the synaptic
cleft. however, several groups have reported no change in

214

p. govitrapong et al. / neurochemistry international 41 (2002) 209–216

serotonin uptake in the platelets of schizophrenic patients
(kaplan and mann, 1982; arora and meltzer, 1982). as a
note of caution, wood et al. (1983) observed that there was
no significant correlation between uptake of serotonin and
[3 h]imipramine binding in schizophrenic patients. rotman
et al. (1982) reported that uptake of serotonin was decreased,
but the bmax for [3 h] imipramine binding was unchanged in
their schizophrenic patients.
4.2. platelet serotonin transporter in schizophrenic
patients with different classes of neuroleptic treatments
there have been many studies involving 5-ht uptake in
schizophrenic patients who had been treated with different types of neuroleptics. for example, arora and meltzer
(1983) investigated the effect of chlorpromazine on platelet
5-ht uptake in schizophrenic patients and normal subjects.
5-ht uptake was studied before and after 2–3 weeks of
treatment with chlorpromazine (200–600 mg per day). administration of chlorpromazine was associated with a significant decrease in platelet 5-ht uptake in both groups
of chlorpromazine treatment. lingjaerde (1983) and stahl
et al. (1983) also reported decreased platelet 5-ht uptake in
chronic neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients. in a preliminary report, rotman et al. (1979) found decreased vmax
for 5-ht uptake in schizophrenic patients treated with neuroleptic medications. stahl et al. (1983) also reported decreased platelet 5-ht uptake in schizophrenic patients taking
neuroleptic drugs, but platelet 5-ht uptake was normal in
drug-free chronic schizophrenic patients. a previous study in
the drug-free and chronic neuroleptic treatment ( xxxd2137xxx 
depot, 40–60 mg every 2 weeks, or haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx ,
50–150 mg every month) by desmedt et al. (1987) found
that platelet serotonin uptake site in treated schizophrenics
did not differ significantly from untreated ones, and there
was no significant difference between any subgroup.
the present result showed that maximum numbers (bmax )
of platelet serotonin transporters in schizophrenic patients
under phenothiazine, butyrophenone, thioxanthene and
serotonin-dopamine antagonist treatments were significantly
reduced when compared with the unmedicated group, but
there was no significant difference from normal control
subjects. in addition, the bprs scores from four medication
groups were significantly lower than unmedicated group,
although they were higher (but not significant) than normal
control subjects. concomitantly, the clinical improvements
occurred in all types of neuroleptic-treated groups.
studies of 5-ht platelet uptake in schizophrenic patients
are inconsistent. discrepancies between the population studied (e.g. chronically and drug treatment), as well as variance
of assay techniques, make it difficult to draw definite conclusions. as a whole, however, the present data and previous
studies, by different group of investigators, have shown that
neuroleptic medications decreased platelet 5-ht uptake in
schizophrenic patients. our previous study (govitrapong
et al., 2000) found that the bmax values of platelet 5-ht2a

receptors were significantly lower in schizophrenic patients
treated with butyrophenones, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes
and serotonin-dopamine antagonists, than those obtained
from the drug-free group, but were comparable to control values. our present observation shares similar findings
(peroutka and snyder, 1980) to the down-regulation of
serotonin receptor or brain imipramine binding sites found
after chronic tricyclic antidepressant treatment. however,
the mechanisms by which neuroleptics suppressed the
supersensitivity of serotonin transporter numbers in unmedicated patients are unknown. the reported effect of
selective 5-ht2a antagonists on negative symptoms, as
well as the decreased csf 5-hiaa shown in schizophrenia,
might suggest that the nature of this dysfunction involved
5-ht2 post-synaptic receptor hypersensitivity. serotonergic post-synaptic receptor hypersensitivity would be expected to lead to a compensatory decrease of central 5-ht
metabolism (lowered csf 5-hiaa).
4.3. platelet serotonin transporters in various periods of
neuroleptic treatments
this study was also interested in a comparison of various duration of neuroleptic treatments. different groups
of schizophrenic patients who had been under neuroleptic
treatments for 1–4 weeks, 1–4 months, 4–12 months and
>1 year were studied. our results indicated that the bmax
values in the patients who received neuroleptic drugs in
every treatment period, including the 1–4 weeks group, was
significantly lower compared with unmedicated patients.
the bprs scores in different duration of treatments were
also significantly lower than untreated-group. the present
data are comparable to our previous report (govitrapong
et al., 2000) on the platelet  xxxg1113xxx -binding of
schizophrenic patients during various durations of neuroleptic treatment (2–4 weeks, 1–4 months, 4–12 months and >1
year). the results indicated lower bmax values in patients
who received neuroleptic drugs for every treatment period,
compared with unmedicated patients.
the mechanism by which neuroleptics suppressed the
up-regulation of the 5-ht2a receptors and transporter
numbers are still unclear. according to the hypothesis of
freedman et al. (1981), a subgroup of schizophrenic patients with elevated whole blood 5-ht levels might be due
to a lowered level of 5-ht in the brain. this decreased brain
5-ht concentration might in turn mediate 5-ht receptor
hypersensitivity. several studies (borcsiczky et al., 1996;
muck-seler et al., 1999; meszaros et al., 1998; stahl et al.,
1983) also found that platelet serotonin concentrations
were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia,
compared with normal subjects. however, other studies
(muck-seler et al., 1988; kolakowska and molyneux, 1987;
joseph et al., 1977) failed to find elevated platelet serotonin.
the correlation between the peripheral and central
serotonin systems is still unclear. king et al. (1985) presented positive correlation between peripheral (platelet

serotonin levels) and central (cerebrospinal concentration
of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) measures of serotonin
metabolism in schizophrenic patients. a potential role for
the peripheral self-regulatory system may be speculated as
follows: the changes in the bmax values of 5-ht2a receptors and 5-ht transporter are likely to be consequences
of changes in 5-ht level. studies with rabbit platelets,
wölfel et al. (1988) demonstrated that the platelet shape
change reaction induced by serotonin binding to 5-ht2a
receptor modulates the saturation kinetics of the serotonin
uptake by augmenting the hill coefficient and changing the
affinity of the [3 h]imipramine binding site. this process
was reversed by  xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht2a antagonist; it was
suggested that enhanced serotonin uptake was involved in
 xxxg1113xxx  activation. the intra-individual correlation of 5-ht2a receptors of cortex and platelets suggested
a common regulatory mechanism, and thus, permitted the
speculation that peripheral receptor changes reflect processes in the brain (andres et al., 1993). the possible
implication of the alteration of platelet serotonin transporter
number in these patients might be used as a model to study
changes of 5-ht system in schizophrenia. however, further
studies to examine the roles of 5-ht transmission in the
etiopathology and/or treatment of schizophrenia are likely
to yield productive results.
in conclusion, the present results indicate that an alteration of platelet serotonin transporters is associated with
schizophrenia. treatments with various types of neuroleptics suppressed the up-regulation of platelet serotonin
transporters. significantly, clinical improvement occurred
in all neuroleptic-treated groups and all different treatment
duration in this study. the mechanisms of how neuroleptics achieve their therapeutic effects still need to be further
evaluated.
