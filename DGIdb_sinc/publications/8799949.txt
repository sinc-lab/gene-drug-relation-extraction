abstract—potassium channels closed by increases in intracellular atp levels (k,;+p channels) have been
described in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cell types. these channels are responsive to the
metabolic state of the cells, and can be opened by a decrease in intracellular atp levels and intra- or
extracellular acidosis. hemorrhagic shock is associated with early vasomotor paralysis as well as with early
derangements in the intracellular metabolic status. here we have tested whether activation of karp
channels contributes to the vasodilatation and early mortality in a rat model of severe hemorrhagic shock.
in anesthetized rats hemorrhaged to a mean arterial blood pressure (map) of 35 mmhg, inhibition of karp
channels with  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd3392xxx  (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus injection followed by an infusion of 10
mg/kg/h for 60 min), rapidly increased map and improved survival rate. the same dose of the k,;p channel
inhibitors did not cause a significant increase of map in animals not subjected to hemorrhage. the
approach of inhibition of ka;p channel activation in hemorrhagic shock is worthy of further investigations
to determine whether it may represent a novel approach for early resuscitation during hemorrhage.

introduction

potassium channels closed by increases in intracellular atp
levels (k arp channels) have been described in a variety of cells
including cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells
(1). the channels are responsive to the metabolic state of the
cells, and can be opened by a decrease in intracellular atp
levels and intra- or extracellular acidosis (1). opening of ‘the
channel results in potassium efflux, cellular hyperpolarization,
reduction of the entry of extracellular calcium via voltage-
dependent calcium channels, and ultimately, vascular smooth
muscle relaxation (1).

opening of k,yp channels in the plasma membrane of
vascular smooth muscle cells represents one of the major
vasodilator mechanisms in response to vasoactive agents. it has
recently been established that opening of these channels is
involved in the vasodilatation of blood vessels in response to
the peptides calcitonin gene-related peptide and vasoactive
intestinal peptide (1), and to adenosine (2). interestingly, the
free radical  xxxd2738xxx  (no) has also been shown to open
karp channels (3).

the k,7yp channels can be modulated by a variety of phar-
macological agents that can be used in vitro and in vivo.
known agents that prevent the opening of the channels include
the anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs  xxxd2215xxx  and tolaz-
amide. in fact, the anti-diabetic (insulin releasing) properties of
this drug are related to closing of the k,7p channels in the

pancreatic beta islet cells (and subsequent depolarization of the
cell membrane followed by elevation of intracellular calcium
and eventually, insulin release) (4).

there are a limited number of experimental studies demon-
strating alterations in the activity of the k,yp channels under
pathophysiological conditions. opening of the k,yp channels
has been reported in the heart (2) in response to ischemia. in
endotoxemia and in lactic acidosis, inhibitors of the ky-yp
channels selectively increase blood pressure in dogs, suggest-
ing that shock causes opening of these channels (5, 6). simi-
larly, in a rat model of liver cirrhosis, opening of the k,-+p
channels is suggested by data showing that inhibition of these
channels causes a selective increase in blood pressure, and that
additional pharmacological opening of the channels in cirrhotic
rats has reduced vasodilatory actions (7). in the present study,
we addressed the contribution of the k,yp channels in the
pathogenesis of vascular failure in hemorrhagic shock (hs).

materials and methods

surgical procedures

the animal experiments have been performed in accordance with national
institutes of health guidelines and with the approval of the animal care and
use committee of the children’s hospital research foundation. male wistar
rats weighing 280-300 g (charles river laboratories, wilmington, ma) were
anesthetized with sodium thiopentol (120 mg/kg, i.p.) (abbott laboratories,
chicago, il) and instrumented as described (8). all animals were pretreated
with heparin (500 u/kg, i.v.). the trachea was cannulated to facilitate respi-
ration and temperature was maintained at 37°c using a homeothermic blanket.
the right carotid artery was cannulated and connected to a pressure transducer
for the measurement of phasic and mean arterial blood pressure (map) and
heart rate, which were digitized using a maclab a/d converter (ad instru-
392 shock vor. 5, no. 6

ments, milford, ma), and stored and displayed on a macintosh personal
computer. the left femoral vein was cannulated for the administration of
drugs. the right femoral artery was cannulated for blood withdrawal. upon
completion of the surgical procedure, cardiovascular parameters were allowed
to stabilize for 10 min.

hemorrhagic shock model

ten minutes after the completion of the surgical procedure, rats were
subjected to a severe hemorrhagic shock by withdrawing blood from the
femoral artery into a reservoir until map stabilized at 35 mmhg (9). in this
model, the rate of blood withdrawal was approximately 0.3 ml/min, and the
volume of blood withdrawn was approximately 25 ml/kg, and was not
different between individual groups. after the end of blood withdrawal (ap-
prox. 25 min after the initiation of bleeding), vehicle or drug treatment was
administered. the times represented in fig. 1 are relative to the end of the
hemorrhage. animals were divided into three groups. in the control group,
dimethylsulfoxide, the vehicle for  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3392xxx , was admin-
istered (n = 13). in the two treated groups,  xxxd2215xxx  (sigma, st. louis,
mo) (n = 13) or  xxxd3392xxx  (sigma) (n = 9) were administered as a 10 mg/kg
slow i.v. bolus in .3 ml of saline, followed by an infusion of 10 mg/kg/h in .3
ml. thereafter, map was monitored until t = 60 min. in the vehicle-treated
group, after the end of bleeding, no significant compensatory efforts were
observed and no additional blood was withdrawn. animals that died before the
end of the experiment were excluded from the calculation of blood pressure or

mg/kg/h in .3 ml. initial map values (before the start of the hemorrhage)
were 122 + 5, 114 + 5, and 119 + 4 mmbg in the control group and
in the  xxxd2215xxx - and  xxxd3392xxx -treated groups, respectively, and

survivor animals only at each time point.

control experiments

in control rats, 10 min after the completion of the surgical procedure,
 xxxd2215xxx  (n = 4) or  xxxd3392xxx  (n = 4) was administered as a 10 mg/kg
slow i.v. bolus in .3 ml of saline, followed by an infusion of 10 mg/kg/h in .3
ml. thereafter, map was monitored until t = 60 min.

statistical analysis

data are reported as means + standard error of the mean (sem). statistical
analysis were performed using analysis of variance (anova). when signif-
icant differences were found, student-newman-keuls test was used to identify
the differences between specific groups. for comparisons in survival rate, the
chi-square was used. the level of significance was defined as p < .05.

results

in rats subjected to hs, map remained between 35~—45
mmhg until t = 60 min (fig. 1a). in agreement with previous
findings using this model (9), approximately 80% of the vehi-
cle-treated animals died within 60 min after the hemorrhage
(fig. 1b). treatment of rats subjected to hs with  xxxd2215xxx 
or  xxxd3392xxx  raised map to approximately 70 mmhg within
5-10 min. thereafter, map showed a further increase in the
 xxxd3392xxx -treated group, whereas there was a slow decrease in
map in the  xxxd2215xxx -treated group (fig. 1a). map in the
groups of rats treated with either k,;p channel blocker re-
mained significantly higher than in the vehicle-treated group.
moreover, at the end of experiment, at 60 min after the start of
the hemorrhage, 3 of 13 vehicle-treated animals survived,
whereas 6 of 9 and 9 of 13 animals survived in the groups
treated with  xxxd3392xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , respectively. thus,
at t = 60 min, both k,7p channel blockers produced a signif-
icant (p < .05) improvement in the rate of survival in rats
subjected to hs (fig. 1b). there was no significant change in
the heart rate at 60 min of hs when compared to controls; heart
rate values (control and 60 min value) were 404 + 15 and 379
+ 22 bpm for the vehicle-treated group, 394 + 13 and 375 +
25 bpm for the  xxxd2215xxx -treated group, and 368 + 11 and
356 + 8 bpm for the  xxxd3392xxx -treated group.

in the animals treated with  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3392xxx ,
there was no significant difference in the initial pressor re-
sponses between the survivor and nonsurvivor animals. for
instance, at 15 min, map was 70 + 4 mmhg in the  xxxd2215xxx -
clamide-treated survivors (n = 9) and 73 + 8 mmhg in the
nonsurvivors (n = 4). this suggests that activation of karp
channels occurs in all animals, but other factors are also
involved in determining short-term survival.

in animals anesthetized and instrumented but not subjected
to hs, the same treatment regimen with the k,yyp channel
blockers did not alter map. for instance, map in the tolaz-
amide-treated group was 120 + 5 mmhg before treatment and
134 + 5 mmhg 60 min after the treatment, p > .05 (n = 4),
whereas similar values in the  xxxd2215xxx -treated group were
122 + 2 mmhg before treatment and 115 + 7 mmhg 60 min
after the treatment, p > .05 (n = 4). these treatments did not
cause a significant change in the heart rate (data not shown).

discussion

aggressive resuscitation is necessary to restore perfusion to
critical organs in the early phase of hs. in addition to conven-
tional treatment with intravenous administration of large vol-
umes of fluid, pharmacologic means of increasing perfusion
pressure have been recently proposed as a novel method of
resuscitation, which may be useful, especially for the military
setting. for instance, inhibition of the endothelial no synthase
has been shown in rat and porcine models of hemorrhagic
shock to increase map (9, 10). in the present report we provide
evidence that inhibition of k,y;p channels improves mean
arterial blood pressure and survival in an acute severe model of
hs.

what is the mode of action of the k, 7p channel blockade in
hs? clearly, there is now convincing evidence that tissue
acidosis, hypoxia, and atp depletion occur in response to
supply-dependent oxygen consumption during severe hemor-
rhage (11). patch clamp studies have demonstrated that two of
the defining characteristics of hs, hypoxia and severely dimin-
ished intracellular levels of atp, induce k,7p channel activa-
tion, resulting in potassium efflux, hyperpolarization, reduced
intracellular calcium in the vascular smooth muscle cells, and
vasodilatation (1, 2). acidosis, although not independently
sufficient to cause k,yp channel activation, allosterically po-
tentiates channel opening in response to moderate decrements
in atp concentration, perhaps by protonating the channel itself
(1).

the dose of  xxxd2215xxx  was chosen based on previous
studies in rats (7, 12). vasoconstriction in response to inhibi-
tion of k,yp channels does not represent a nonspecific mech-
anism (unlike inhibition of  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx ), since  xxxd2215xxx -
clamide or  xxxd3392xxx  had minimal effects in normal rats.
gardiner and co-workers have found a slight pressor effect of
karp channel blockade by  xxxd2215xxx  (20 mg/kg) in chron-
ically instrumented rats, which was associated with a mild
vasoconstriction in the renal but not the mesenteric vascular
bed (12). the latter finding may suggest that some k,7p
activation in some but certainly not all vascular beds may
represent a physiological vasoregulatory mechanism. how-
ever, our current data suggest that under conditions of shock
and ischemia, the degree of k,7p channel activation may
increase, and the blockade of this provides beneficial effects.
similar to our observations, previous large animal studies in
dogs and pigs subjected to endotoxin shock have demonstrated
that inhibition of k,7p channels with  xxxd2215xxx  increases
map (5, 6). moreover, in rats with liver cirrhosis,  xxxd2215xxx -
clamide provided a significant increase in portal and systemic
vascular resistance (7). the activation of k,yp channels, again,
was proposed to be related to local ischemia, lactic acidosis,
and atp depletion. in addition to metabolic factors, humoral
mechanisms may also contribute to the opening of the karp
channels in hs: there is evidence demonstrating the release of
calcitonin gene-related peptide (13) and adenosine (14) in hs.
opening of kayp channels is known to contribute to the
vasodilatory effect of both of these agents (1, 2).

is no involved in the early activation of k,yp channels in
hs? clearly, no and peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic oxidant formed

 xxxg1232xxx  inhibition in hemorrhagic shoock 393

by no and superoxide are, indeed, produced in the early phase
of hemorrhagic shock and are involved in the early vasode-
pression (8, 15). moreover, there are in vitro data that no is
able to activate k, +p channels (3). in spite of these data, we do
not believe that no plays a major role in the activation of k,rp
channels in shock for the following reasons: 1) hypotension
elicited by a no-donor agent is not reversed by  xxxd2215xxx 
in dogs (6), and 2) in cirrhotic rats, pretreatment with nos
inhibitors does not prevent the vasoconstrictor effect of glib-
enclamide (7). thus, no production and k, 7p channel activa-
tion are more likely to represent parallel, rather than interre-
lated vasodilator mechanisms in shock.

at 20-50 min after the beginning of the hemorrhage, map
in the  xxxd3392xxx -treated group was higher than map in the
 xxxd2215xxx -treated group. the explanation for this effect
may be, in part, due to the combination of the following facts:
1) the survival rate in the  xxxd3392xxx -treated animals was lower
than in the  xxxd2215xxx  treated groups; and 2) the blood’
pressure is calculated based on the number of surviving ani-
mals only (see “materials and methods”). however, at 60 min,
the map in the  xxxd3392xxx -treated group was still higher than
map in the  xxxd2215xxx -treated group, although the heart
rates and the survival rates were the same. although we do not
have information on the distribution, bioavailability, and me-
tabolism of  xxxd2215xxx  versus  xxxd3392xxx  in our rats, it is
possible that mechanisms other than increase in map also
contribute to the increased survival rate in animals treated with
the k,;p channel inhibitors.

in the present study, all groups of animals received heparin
pretreatment. heparin is known to have protective effects in
hemorrhagic shock, and has been shown to ameliorate the
microcirculatory and cellular energetic alterations (16, 17). of
note, the protective effects of heparin are not necessarily re-
lated to its anti-coagulant activities (16, 17). it is conceivable
that without the heparin pretreatment, the cardiovascular de-
rangement would have been more severe in our experimental
model.

the optimal approach to the initial resuscitation of hemor-
rhagic shock remains controversial. prompt aggressive volume
resuscitation is generally considered optimal to restore perfu-
sion to critical organs within the “golden hour” following
trauma, in the setting of an intensive care unit. however, the
traditional means of accomplishing this goal, the intravenous
administration of large volumes of fluid, has been criticized on
the grounds that replenishment of the vascular compartment
might reopen wounds (18). pharmacologic means of increasing
perfusion pressure have also been disparaged because of fears
that vasopressor therapy might worsen end-organ perfusion. in
addition, many commonly used vasopressor and inotropic
agents, such as norepinephrine, quickly lose their effectiveness
during hemorrhagic shock, which makes their usefulness very
limited (15). our present study suggests that loss of vasopres-
sor effectiveness does not occur with k, 7p channel blockers in
hemorrhagic shock over 60 min. in comparison, marked loss of
the vasopressor effect of norepinephrine can be observed over
60 min in the same experimental model (10) or even in re-
sponse to less severe bleeding (15). we therefore believe that,
394 shock vo. 5, no. 6

based on the current and previous data, inhibition of karp
channels may represent a novel, promising method of resusci-
tation in various forms of refractory circulatory shock—alone,
or perhaps in combination with volume replacement. although
 xxxd2215xxx , in the dose range used in our study, does not
elicit notable hypoglycemia in the rat (7), hypoglycemia may
be one potential side effect in large animal studies or potential
human trials. this side effect, however, may be easily over-
come with glucose co-administration. a more serious concern
in the use of any vasopressor in the resuscitation of hs is the
development of ischemia in critical tissues. further studies
should determine whether k,7p channel inhibition in the early
phase of hs improves map and at what cost or benefit in
terms of regional perfusion and tissue metabolism. in addition,
further work on the longer-term survival and immunological
alterations is necessary before making assumptions as to the
ultimate usefulness of this novel approach. nevertheless, the
present work should encourage further studies with k, 7p chan-
nel blockers in shock.
