antinociceptive action of amlodipine blocking n-type ca2+ channels at the primary afferent neurons in mice.  we investigated the antinociceptive action of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, which acts on both l- and n-type voltage-dependent ca2+ channels (vdccs), in mice. intrathecal injection of amlodipine (300 nmol/kg) significantly shortened the licking time in the late phase of a formalin test, while no effect was found with another dihydropyridine derivative,  xxxd2718xxx  (300 nmol/kg). cilnidipine and omega-conotoxin gvia also showed marked analgesic effects under the same experimental conditions. transcripts of alpha1a, alpha1b, alpha1e, alpha1f, alpha1h,  xxxg838xxx , and beta4 subunits were detected by polymerase-chain reaction (pcr) in the dorsal root ganglion, suggesting the existence of a variety of voltage-dependent ca2+ channels. electrophysiological experiments showed that amlodipine and cilnidipine inhibit n-type currents in the dorsal root ganglion cells. these results suggest that amlodipine, cilnidipine, and omega-conotoxin gvia exert their antinociceptive actions by blocking n-type ca2+ channels in the primary nociceptive afferent fibers. blocking of the ca2+ channels results in attenuation of synaptic transmission of nociceptive neurons. furthermore, it is suggested that some  xxxg303xxx  blockers might have therapeutic potential as analgesics when applied directly into the subarachnoidal space.
