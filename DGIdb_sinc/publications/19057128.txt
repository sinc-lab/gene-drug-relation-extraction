abstract. little is known about the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors
on matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) in right ventricular remodeling. we investigated the effect
of captopril, an ace inhibitor, on  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in monocrotaline-induced right
ventricular hypertrophy. six-week-old male wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with
monocrotaline (60 mg/ kg) or saline. the rats were administrated captopril (30 mg / kg per day) or
a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection. at day 25, echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised. expressions and activities of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were measured by western blotting and by gelatin zymography, respectively. in monocrotalineinjected rats, right ventricular weight / tail length ratio increased significantly. histological
analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections. echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats. the right
ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. however, captopril
did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure.  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  expressions and
activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril
inhibited them. these findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotalineinduced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in
rats.

 xxxg99xxx  may act directly on the myocardium to
promote unfavorable remodeling by causing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis (2). inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace) inhibitors can decrease pathological ventricular remodeling and mortality in patients

matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of zincdependent proteinases, have an important role in the
development of clinical and experimental cardiac
diseases models through degradation of the extracellular
matrix, whose functions include maintenance of tissue
structure and retention of bioactive molecules (4, 5).
inhibition of mmps by ace inhibitors, mmp inhibitor,
and gene deletion attenuated left ventricular remodeling
(6 – 9). however, so far there is no direct evidence for a
relationship between mmps and ace inhibitors in right

introduction
heart failure or myocardial dysfunction is a major
contributor to morbidity and mortality. the myocardial
dysfunction and the attendant reduction of forward
cardiac output lead to stimulation of neurohumoral
systems, particularly the autonomic nervous and reninangiotensin systems. these compensatory responses
maintain blood flow to organs by increasing ventricular
preload, enhancing myocardial contractility, and increasing arterial tone (1). however, each of these compensatory responses would also promote disease progression.
the neurohumoral factors such as noradrenaline and

ventricular remodeling.
monocrotaline produces pulmonary hypertension by
impairing the endothelium of pulmonary artery. the
increased pulmonary arterial pressure by monocrotaline
evokes right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction (10 – 13). the development of monocrotalineinduced right ventricular hypertrophy was ameliorated
by ace inhibitors (14).  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  immunoreactivities were augmented in right ventricular hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline treatment in rats (15).
we hypothesized that ace inhibitors might attenuate
mmps in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular
hypertrophy. therefore, the purpose of the present study
was to evaluate the influence of captopril, a prototypical
ace inhibitor, on expressions and activities of  xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx  during the monocrotaline-induced right
ventricular hypertrophy.
materials and methods

parameter for right ventricular systolic function, was
also measured. briefly, tricuspid annular plane systolic
excursion was measured in the m-mode from the apical
four chamber view and it expresses the motion of
tricuspid annulus.
pulmonary artery pressure measurements
pulmonary artery pressure was measured by the
method of rabinovitch et al. (16). briefly, rats were
anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg / kg, i.p.) and
then the right jugular vein was exteriorized. then
catheter filled with a heparin-saline solution was
inserted into right ventricle through the right jugular
vein with a small incision and advanced into the
pulmonary artery. the catheter was connected to the
mlt0670 disposable bp transducer (adinstruments,
colorado springs, co, usa), and pulmonary artery
pressure was measured using a ml117 bp amp
(adinstruments) and a ml825 powerlab 2 / 25
(adinstruments) system.

animal models
all animals were cared for in accordance with the
kitasato university guidelines for animal treatment,
which meet international guiding principles of laboratory animal care. six-week-old male wistar rats (clea
japan, inc., tokyo) maintained on a standard laboratory
diet and tap water and exposed to a 12 / 12 h light-dark
cycle at 23°c were used in the experiments. rats
received a single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (60 mg / kg; wako pure chemical industries, ltd.,
osaka). monocrotaline was dissolved in 1 n hcl and
neutralized with 1 n naoh. control rats were injected
with saline (2.5 ml / kg). from the day of monocrotaline
injection, captopril (30 mg / kg per day, wako pure
chemical industries, ltd.) or distilled water (1 ml / kg
per day, as a vehicle) were administrated orally for
24 days.

histology
after echocardiographic examination, hearts were
excised for histological and biochemical examinations.
the hearts were separated into right and left atrial or
ventricular tissues. isolated ventricular tissues were
weighed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. thin tissue
sections (2 mum) were made and deparaffinized by the
standard procedure. hematoxylin and eosin (h&e)
staining and azan staining were performed. for azan
staining, deparaffinized sections were immersed in 5%
potassium dichromate solution for 30 min and stained
with azocarmine g for 20 min. then sections were
immersed in 12-tungsto-(vi)-phosphoric acid n-hydrate
solution for 1 h and stained with aniline blue-orange g
for 30 min.

echocardiography
echocardiography was performed at day 25 after
monocrotaline injection under pentobarbital (50 mg / kg
i.p.) anesthesia using sonos 5500 (hewlett-packard
co., andover, ma, usa) with a dynamically focused
s12 probe (5 – 12 mhz. hewlett packard co.). pulsed
doppler of pulmonary artery flow velocity was recorded
in the short axis view at the level of the aortic valve.
acceleration time was measured as the time it takes to
reach the peak velocity from the starting velocity.
ejection time is the time period from the beginning
to the end of pulmonary artery flow. acceleration
time / ejection time ratio was calculated as the index of
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, a

western blot analysis
western blotting was performed as described previously (17). right ventricular samples were homogenized in lysis buffer [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5),
150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta-2na, 1 mm egta, 1%
triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm betaglycerophosphate, 1 mm na3vo4, 1 mg / ml leupeptin;
cell signaling technology inc., danvers, ma, usa]
containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (nacalai
tesque, inc., kyoto). the homogenates were centrifuged
and the supernatant was used as soluble proteins. the
soluble proteins (20 mug) were separated on 7.5% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(sds-page) and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (pall co., ann arbor, mi, usa). after block-

ing with 0.5% skim milk, the membranes were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against  xxxg1428xxx 
(santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca, usa),
 xxxg1440xxx  (millipore co., billerica, ma, usa), and
mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (sigmaaldrich co., st. louis, mo, usa). hrp-conjugated anti

were incubated overnight in incubation buffer [50 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 5 mm cacl2, 1 µm  xxxd3556xxx ] at 37°c.
then the gels were stained with 0.1% coomassie blue
g-250 and destained with ion-exchanged water until
bands were visible. mmp activity was presented as an
unstained band in comparison with mmp standards
(sigma-aldrich co.).

results
biometrical changes
table 1 shows the biometrical changes of the animals
at day 25 after monocrotaline-injection. body weights

decreased significantly in the monocrotaline group
compared with the control (p<0.05). captopril treatment
did not prevent the body weight loss (p<0.05 vs control).
body weight in the captopril alone group was less
than that in the control (p<0.05), but significantly higher
than that in the monocrotaline group (p<0.05). right
ventricular weight was corrected by tail length. right
ventricular weight / tail length ratio increased by about
2-fold in the monocrotaline group compared with the
control (p<0.05). right ventricular weight / tail length
ratio for captopril alone was similar to the control. this
ratio was significantly decreased with monocrotaline +
captopril (p<0.05 vs monocrotaline). while the sum of
left ventricular and interventricular septum weight / tail
length ratio was not different between the control and
monocrotaline group, it significantly decreased with
monocrotaline + captopril or captopril alone (p<0.05 vs
control). lung wet weight increased in the monocrotaline group (p<0.05 vs control) but not in the captopril
alone group compared with the control. this increase
was significantly prevented in the group treated with
monocrotaline + captopril (p<0.05 vs monocrotaline).
histological analysis
h&e and azan staining in the sections revealed that
hypertrophy and fibrosis of right ventricular myocardium
were induced by monocrotaline (fig. 1: c and d).
captopril treatment inhibited hypertrophy (fig. 1e) and
attenuated fibrosis (fig. 1f). no histological abnormality
was observed in the captopril alone group (fig. 1: g
and h).
echocardiography
assessment of right ventricular functional change was
done by echocardiography. acceleration of pulmonary
artery flow velocity was a characteristic change of the
wave form in the monocrotaline group (fig. 2a: b). the

acceleration time / ejection time ratio in the group
treated with captopril alone was similar to the control
(0.386 ± 0.021, n = 13) (fig. 2b). we next examined
tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to assess right
ventricular systolic function (fig. 2a: e – h). tricuspid
annular plane systolic excursion decreased significantly
in monocrotaline group (1.81 ± 0.09 mm, n = 10,
p<0.05) compared with the control (3.11 ± 0.10 mm,
n = 14). this decrease was inhibited significantly in
the monocrotaline + captopril group (2.29 ± 0.13 mm,
n = 13, p<0.05 vs monocrotaline). tricuspid annular
plane systolic excursion in the group treated with
captopril alone was decreased significantly compared
with the control (2.69 ± 0.12 mm, n = 11, p<0.05)
(fig. 2c).
pulmonary artery pressure
pulmonary artery pressure was increased significantly
in the monocrotaline group (41.4 ± 0.8 mmhg, n = 4,
p<0.05) compared with the control (23.0 ± 0.8 mmhg,
n = 6). captopril did not attenuate the increase in
pulmonary artery pressure by monocrotaline (39.2 ± 1.2
mmhg, n = 3). captopril alone had no effect on pulmonary artery pressure (21.6 ± 1.3 mmhg, n = 5).

wave forms in the monocrotaline + captopril group and
captopril alone group were similar to those in the control
(fig. 2a: c and d). acceleration time / ejection time ratio
in the group treated with monocrotaline (0.210 ± 0.021,
n = 12, p<0.05) decreased significantly compared with
the control (0.380 ± 0.018, n = 14). in monocrotaline +
captopril group, acceleration time / ejection time ratio
significantly increased compared with monocrotaline
(0.300 ± 0.017, n = 15, p<0.05 vs monocrotaline).

 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  expressions
western blot analysis showed that  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  expressions increased significantly in the monocrotaline group (408 ± 41% and 248 ± 35% respectively,
n = 19, p<0.05) compared with the control (n = 13).
captopril treatment significantly inhibited  xxxg1428xxx 
expression (277 ± 44%, n = 17, p<0.05 vs monocrotaline) and reversed  xxxg1440xxx  expression (153 ± 22%,
n = 17, p<0.05 vs monocrotaline) to a similar level in the
control. captopril alone had no effect on  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  expressions (116 ± 18% and 84 ± 8% respectively, n = 13) (fig. 3.).
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities
gelatin zymography was used to determine the effect
of captopril on  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities in
monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy.
both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities increased significantly with monocrotaline (149 ± 5% and 268 ± 23%
respectively, n = 19, p<0.05), compared with the control
(n = 13). the increased  xxxg1440xxx  activity was significantly decreased by captopril to a similar level in the
control (148 ± 17%, n = 17, p<0.05 vs monocrotaline).
the increased  xxxg1428xxx  activity tended to decline by
captopril treatment (132 ± 6%, n = 17), but the effect
was not significant. captopril alone had no effect on
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities (111 ± 7% and 91 ± 7%,
n = 13) (fig. 4.).

discussion

rats. to the best of our knowledge, this is a novel finding
about the effects of captopril against mmps in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy.
right ventricular hypertrophy induced by single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg / kg monocrotaline is
confirmed by the increases in right ventricular
weight / tail length ratio and lung wet weight. histological analysis further revealed the cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy and fibrosis in the right ventricles of
monocrotaline-treated rats. these features are generally
confirmative of the previous reports (10 – 13, 18 – 20).

the main findings of this study are that increased
expressions and activities of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in
monocrotaline-induced hypertrophied right ventricle in
rats are attenuated by long-term treatment with captopril.
consistently, captopril suppressed monocrotalineinduced right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. thus we suggest that captopril may attenuate
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  during the development of
monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in

captopril attenuates mmp in rv hypertrophy

additionally, it has been reported that enalapril, an
ace inhibitor, attenuated monocrotaline-induced right
ventricular hypertrophy (14). consistent with the
reports, the present results showed that captopril inhibits
monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy as
well as fibrosis. left ventricle + interventricular septum
weight / tail length ratio was decreased by captopril in
our experiment, which might be due to decrease in the
body weight by captopril. in fact, the ratio of left
ventricle + interventricular septum weight / body weight
was similar to that of the control (data not shown).
pulsed doppler images revealed acceleration of
pulmonary artery flow velocity and significant decrease
in acceleration time / ejection time ratio in the monocrotaline-injected rats. jones et al. (18) observed similar
acceleration of pulmonary artery flow velocity in the
monocrotaline-induced rat right ventricular hypertrophy
model. they suggested that this acceleration is a
characteristic feature of pulmonary hypertension.
shortening of acceleration time / ejection time ratio is
used for a marker of pulmonary hypertension and it
well correlates with the degree of right ventricular
hypertrophy (19). hardziyenka et al. (20) demonstrated
that tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was
significantly decreased in monocrotaline-induced right
ventricular failure in rats. right ventricular systolic
function was evaluated by measuring tricuspid annular
plane systolic excursion in our experiment. monocrotaline significantly decreased tricuspid annular plane
systolic excursion. captopril treatment suppressed this
change. there are controversial reports about the
influence of ace inhibitor on monocrotaline-induced
pulmonary hypertension. van suylen et al. (21) reported
that captopril has no significant effect on pulmonary
artery pressure in monocrotaline-treated rats. on the
other hand, kanno et al. (14) reported that enalapril
attenuated pulmonary hypertension. the present study
showed that increased mean pulmonary artery pressure
by monocrotaline was not attenuated by captopril. from
these results, it is suggested that captopril may attenuate
monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy
and functional disorder without affecting pulmonary
artery pressure. captopril itself decreased tricuspid
annular plane systolic excursion in the present study.
although the decrease might be derived from reduction
in body weight, the precise mechanisms remain unclear.
several studies have reported that mmps have critical
roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart
failure via extracellular matrix remodeling (22 – 25).
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  degrade many components of
extracellular matrices, including type iv collagen,
laminin, and fibronectin.  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  are highly
expressed in the process of ventricular remodeling in

493

several cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure,
cardiomyopathy, and ventricular hypertrophy (5). a
recent study showed that  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  immunoreactivities are upregulated in monocrotaline-induced
hypertrophied right ventricles (15). consistent with the
reports, we found that  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  protein
expressions as well as activities were significantly
increased in monocrotaline-induced hypertrophied right
ventricular tissues. various agents including bioactive
molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors
stimulate induction of mmps (26).  xxxg99xxx  is one
of the major bioactive molecules in cardiac remodeling.
 xxxg99xxx  elicits biologic functions via binding to
 xxxg100xxx . activation of  xxxg100xxx  leads to the
stimulation of transcription factors such as activator
protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor-kappab ( xxxg1559xxx )
(26). in addition, both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  genes
have ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx  binding sites in their promoters
(27 – 29). thus it is possible to speculate that
 xxxg99xxx  activates mmp transcription during
cardiac remodeling and that ace inhibitors prevent
mmp induction via inhibiting  xxxg99xxx  production.
on the other hand, recent studies suggest that ace
inhibitors prevent  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities directly
(9, 30). we demonstrated that captopril treatment
significantly inhibits the expression and activity of
 xxxg1440xxx  and the expression of  xxxg1428xxx . it has not also
been clarified whether ace inhibitors directly affect
the heart or indirectly influence it by improving hemodynamics in cardiac disease (31). in the present study,
captopril attenuated monocrotaline-induced cardiac
hypertrophy without affecting pulmonary artery pressure. thus captopril may directly inhibit  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  during the development of monocrotalineinduced right ventricular hypertrophy.
in summary, captopril attenuates  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx 
expressions and activities during monocrotaline-induced
right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction
in rats. further study is necessary to elucidate the
mechanisms through which captopril attenuates these
mmps.
