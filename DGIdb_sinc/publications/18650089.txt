a b s t r a c t
human  xxxg766xxx  ( xxxg766xxx ,  xxxg766xxx ) is a key gluconeogenic enzyme, responsible for
the hydrolysis of  xxxd2164xxx  to fructose-6-phosphate, and thus presents an opportunity
for the development of novel therapeutics focused on lowering the hepatic glucose production in type
2 diabetics. in its active form  xxxg766xxx  exists as a homotetramer and is allosterically regulated by amp.
in an hts campaign aromatic sulfonylureas have been identiﬁed as  xxxg766xxx  inhibitors mimicking amp.
by bridging two adjacent allosteric binding sites using two aromatic sulfonylureas as anchor units and
covalently linking them, it was possible to obtain dual binding amp site inhibitors that exhibit a strong
inhibitory effect.

the hydrophilic nature of amp binding sites and their widespread use for allosteric regulation of enzymes in metabolic pathways has historically made the drug development of amp
mimetics difﬁcult. by using a structure-based drug design strategy
metabasis discovered a series of furylphosphonates that mimic
amp (scheme 1).1,2 the lead compound, mb05032, exhibited high
potency and speciﬁcity for human  xxxg766xxx . oral delivery of
mb05032 was achieved by using the bisamidate prodrug
mb06322 (cs-917), masking the strongly acidic phosphonate motif
which hampers membrane permeation.3
as part of a program aimed at the discovery of  xxxg766xxx  inhibitors
requiring no prodrug strategy, we performed a high-throughput
screening campaign focusing on the allosteric amp binding site.
inhibition of recombinant human liver  xxxg766xxx  activity was assayed
using the malachite green procedure4 to determine the inorganic
phosphate release that results from dephosphorylation of  xxxd2164xxx .5 by measuring  xxxg766xxx  inhibition with and
without the catalytic site inhibitor fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (f2,6-p) as well as by surface plasmon resonance competition experiments6 with amp,7 we could identify a hit cluster of aromatic sulfonylureas that speciﬁcally bind to this site. the sulﬁde 1a (scheme
2) is a representative of this class and inhibits human liver  xxxg766xxx 
with an ic50 value of 1.6 lm, which is further lowered by a factor
2.5 in the presence of f-2,6-p, characteristic of the cooperative
binding of f-2,6-p and allosteric inhibitors.8

the high ligand binding efﬁciency of compound 1a (0.47 kcal/
mol/atom) in  xxxg766xxx  prompted us to further investigate this complex by x-ray crystallography. we were able to co-crystallize this
compound with human liver  xxxg766xxx  and solve the complex structure to a resolution of 2.2 å.9 figure 1 conﬁrms that the sulfonylureas occupy all four allosteric amp sites of the  xxxg766xxx  tetramer,
each of which is 30 å away from the catalytic site of the respective monomer.
interestingly, the structure reveals clear electron density
between the thiol groups of two molecules 1a that occupy the allosteric amp sites of adjacent  xxxg766xxx  monomers. the two neighboring sulfur atoms are in covalent bond distance (d = 2.02 å)
suggesting a disulﬁde 1b rather than two monosulﬁdes 1a occupy-

ing the two neighboring amp sites. upon analysis by lc/ms the solid sample of the screening hit 1a was found to be contaminated
with about 5% disulﬁde 1b, and the amount of disulﬁde in a 1:1
water/acetonitrile solution grew substantially within a few days
at room temperature. this was assumed to be due to air oxidation
of the thiol (scheme 2).
further analysis of the complex structure reveals that the aniline ring of the ligand sits in the hydrophobic cleft of the amp binding site that is occupied by the adenine base in amp (fig. 2). the
back part of this pocket is not ﬁlled and the para-amino group
not engaged in polar interactions, indicating that a small metasubstituent could be a superior aromatic substitution for improving  xxxg766xxx  afﬁnity. the polar sulfonylurea linker is engaged in several hydrogen bonds, with residues thr31, gly26, and a strongly
interacting water molecule, and has the correct geometry to protrude through a narrow channel into the subunit interface region.
this channel is formed by a short protein stretch ala24–gly28 connecting two adjacent a-helices. the phosphate recognition pocket
of the amp binding site is not occupied by 1b, but by a water molecule, which interacts through four hydrogen bonds with one of
the s@o groups of the ligand as well as leu30, lys112, and
tyr113. this is an elegant indirect way to fulﬁll the binding
requirements of the very polar phosphate recognition pocket without the need for strongly acidic ligand functionalities, such as
phosphates or phosphonates. a similar binding mode in which
the ligand occupies both adenine binding site and interface region
has been described recently for bisarylsulfonamides.10,11 however,
in this case the interaction between two ligand molecules of neighboring  xxxg766xxx  monomers is through non-covalent aromatic p–p
interaction while our inhibitors span the interface by a covalent
linkage.
our experimental observation that two allosteric amp binding
sites can be occupied by a single molecule led us to explore a
new inhibitor design concept for  xxxg766xxx  (scheme 3). the concept
relies on fairly optimized protein–ligand interactions in the classical amp binding site with the search for an optimal covalent linker
connecting two adjacent allosteric sites. it was hoped that the low-

er entropic cost of assembling only two instead of four ligands per
 xxxg766xxx  tetramer could result in improved afﬁnity and selectivity.12
the concept of utilizing two symmetry-related identical binding
sites in multimeric enzymes has been successfully employed in
the design of ligands for, for example, 20s proteasome,13 tryptase,14  xxxg1073xxx ,15  xxxg981xxx ,16, or glycogen
phosphorylase (gp).17 in the last example, two chloroindole
amides in adjacent allosteric binding sites of the dimeric gp were
covalently linked by an 8-atom 1,2-diethoxyethane chain, resulting
in a 2000-fold potency improvement.
the synthesis of the test compounds was accomplished by
known methods18 (scheme 4) starting from corresponding amines
or diamines and reacting them with the complex derived from an
aromatic sulfonylchloride obtained by reaction with sodium cyanate in the presence of pyridine (method a) or by the reaction of
corresponding aliphatic isocyanates with sulfonamides in the presence of sodium hydride (method b).19
physico-chemical properties of a symmetric, dianionic bissulfonylurea core structure as depicted in scheme 3 are in a range (6a:
pka: 5.35, log d (ph 7.4): 0.93, polar surface area: 128 å2; 7a: pka:
5.12, log d (ph 7.4): 0.43, polar surface area: 128 å2) that might
be expected to impair the pharmacokinetic performance of such
compounds, especially with respect to oral bioavailability. gratifyingly, oral bioavailability of (ch2)6 and (ch2)7 linked bissulfonylureas 6a and 7b was found to be almost quantitative in mice when
applied as disodium salts.20
from the structural analysis of figure 2 and work on other aryl
sulfonylureas that bind to only one allosteric site, we identiﬁed 3cl and 3-me substituted phenyls connected to sulfonylureas as
good motifs to interact with the adenine binding site. as schematically drawn in scheme 3, we investigated different linkers connecting these fragments with a focus on the inﬂuence of linker
size, polarity, and rigidity. to quantify the change in inhibitory

(termed ‘dual-site binders’), control compounds that can only bind
to one allosteric site (termed ‘mono-site binders’) but are otherwise similar to the dual-site binders were also synthesized.
bissulfonylureas with alkyl linkers of varying chain length (c2 to
c8) were ﬁrst prepared, and show a consistent trend in  xxxg766xxx  inhibition (table 1) for both the 3-chloro and 3-methylbenzene moiety. a u-shaped curve with an optimal linker length of 7
followed by 6 carbon atoms can be identiﬁed for both series
(fig. 3). this corresponds to the compounds 6a,b and 7a,b, which

are among the most potent inhibitors of human liver  xxxg766xxx  to
date with ic50 values in the low nanomolar range (9–24 nm). xray structures in the 3-chloro phenyl series could be solved for linker lengths c5–c8, and reveal a correlation of the linker length with
the distances between the centers of the phenyl rings in the neighboring adenine binding sites. for c5, the distance is only 17.1 å,
which is 0.7 å below the average distance of the phenyl ring centers of mono-site sulfonylureas for which x-ray structures could
be solved (data not shown). obviously, a c5 linker is too short to
allow for relaxed, optimal interactions in the adenine binding site
leading to an increase in ic50 (entry 5a,b table 1) compared to c6
and c7 linkers. on the other hand, the center distance seems too
long (18.5 å) for c8 linkers.
exemplary for the carbon-linked dual-site binders, figure 4
shows the x-ray structure of bound 7a.9 as for the disulﬁde-bridged
compound 1b, the covalent linker spans the interface region and
connects two adenine binding sites of adjacent  xxxg766xxx  monomers.
as expected, the 3-chlorophenyl substitution points to the back of
the adenine pocket to increase the number of protein–ligand contacts. the electron density in the linker region is less well deﬁned
than for the sulfonylurea anchors, indicating residual ligand ﬂexibility in this region. this ﬂexibility was incorporated into the coordinates using two low-energy conformations that were identiﬁed
by a constrained conformational search of the linker.22 the combined population of the two alternative linker conformations explains the observed electron density.
as demonstrated by our x-ray structures, the stoichiometry of
binding for the bissulfonylureas is two ligands per  xxxg766xxx  tetramer

instead of four as seen so far for allosteric amp site binders. the
difference of two versus four binding events for dual-site and
mono-site binders, respectively, is likely responsible for the qualitatively different cooperativity behavior that was observed in
 xxxg766xxx  inhibition assays. the two types of inhibitors produced sigmoidal dose–response curves with a slope for dual-site binders
that was consistently half of that for mono-site binders.23
substituting one or two carbon atoms of the linker by heteroatoms can considerably affect ic50 values (table 1). the disulﬁdes
17a,b are potent inhibitors, but are less active than their straight
carbon analogs 6a,b, suggesting that the disulﬁde moiety does
not play a signiﬁcant role in the binding apart from connecting
the two sulfonylurea subunits. more polar replacements such as
the ether oxygen in 15b and 18a, and in particular the positively
charged amine nitrogen in 16b and 19a, lead to a signiﬁcant decrease, or almost complete loss in potency. inspection of figure 4
shows that the binding site in the linker region is narrow enough
that at least a part of the solvation shell of the linker heteroatom
is stripped away without compensation by polar protein–ligand
interactions. we hypothesize that the strong dependence on the
polarity of the linker is caused by poorly compensated desolvation
penalties for ether and amine linkers.
preorganizing the predominantly bound ligand conformation
through structure rigidiﬁcation can be a successful strategy to improve binding afﬁnities.24 keeping the chain length close to the
optimum, we have explored double (entries 9a,b) and triple bond
(entry 10b) insertions in the linker to investigate the transferability
of this concept to our series. as can be seen from table 1, all these
conformationally restricted analogs reduce  xxxg766xxx  activity relative
to the more ﬂexible 6a,b. ring insertion to rigidify the linker was
also assessed (entries 11–13), and it either reduced (–ch2-cyclohexyl-ch2–) or only slightly improved (–ch2-phenyl-ch2–) the
activity. in the comparison of 6a,b with 11–13 it should be kept
in mind that the latter compounds contain two additional heavy
atoms that can proﬁt from additional hydrophobic interactions.
overall, these results suggest that any possible preorganization is
outweighed by the hindrance of an optimal geometrical orientation of the two anchor units. moreover, our ﬁnding that several linker conformations rather than a predominant one should be
present in the bound complex reduces the potential afﬁnity gain
through conformational restriction.
the comparison of the ic50 values for the dual-site binders with
their respective control compounds (table 2), which occupy only
one allosteric binding site, reveals a dramatic difference. for example, the highly potent c6 linked bissulfonylurea 6a (17 nm) has a
more than four orders of magnitude (4.1  104) greater inhibitory
potency relative to the corresponding monomer (20a; 690 lm),
which is virtually inactive. surface plasmon resonance measurements of the dissociation constants of 6a and 20a to human liver

 xxxg766xxx  conﬁrm this drastic effect of covalent linkage, however, to a
smaller extent (1.7  103). the observed differences in binding free
energy of 6.3 and 4.4 kcal/mol, respectively, cannot be accounted
for by signiﬁcantly different intermolecular interactions as the
atom count for the two monomers and the dimer are the same
and the protein–ligand contacts in the linker region are relatively
sparse (fig. 4).
to better understand this ﬁnding, we performed mm-pbsa free
energy calculations which can give an estimate of the different
contributions to the free energy of binding.25 the calculated difference in total binding free energy (6.2 kcal/mol)26 for the human liver  xxxg766xxx  complex with four mono-site ligands 20a and two dualsite ligands 6a, respectively, is in good agreement with the experimental results. the individual free energy contributions suggest a
more favorable entropy balance as the dominant contribution for
the lower inhibition constants of the dual-site binders. this is
due to the large translational and rotational entropy penalties for
assembling four mono-site instead of two dual-site binders with
one  xxxg766xxx  tetramer that are only partly compensated by vibrational entropy gains.
in summary, we discovered that the micromolar afﬁnity of the
screening hit 1a to human  xxxg766xxx  was due to a contamination with
the oxidative disulﬁde dimer 1b. as shown by x-ray crystallography,
the active compound 1b spans two adjacent amp binding sites in the
 xxxg766xxx  tetramer. this ﬁnding led to a new inhibitor design concept
covalently connecting two sulfonylurea moieties with linkers of
appropriate lengths. straight chain hexa- and hepta-methylene linkers proved optimal leading to nanomolar inhibitors of  xxxg766xxx .
