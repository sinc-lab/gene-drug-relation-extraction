c1-tetrahydrofolate (thf)1 synthase is a trifunctional enzyme
found in eukaryotes that contains the activities 10-formyl-thf
synthetase ( xxxg1473xxx ), 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase (ec
3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase (ec 1.5.1.5) (fig.
1, reactions 1–3). these activities, along with serine hydroxymethyltransferase (fig. 1, reaction 4), are central to the interconversion
of the one-carbon units carried by the biologically active form of folic
acid, thf. the activated one-carbon units are used in a variety of
cellular processes, including de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, serine and glycine interconversion, methionine biosynthesis,
and protein synthesis in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
in eukaryotic cells, the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments each contain a parallel set of one-carbon unit-interconverting enzymes (1). for example, in the yeast saccharomyces
cerevisiae, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes of c1-thf
synthase (encoded by the nuclear genes mis1 and ade3, respectively) have been purified and characterized (2, 3). both isozymes
exist as homodimers of 100-kda subunits. each subunit consists
of a c-terminal 10-formyl-thf synthetase domain of ⬃70 kda
and an n-terminal bifunctional dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase
domain of ⬃30 kda linked via a proteolytically sensitive connector region. this subunit size and domain structure are shared by
cytoplasmic isozymes from mammalian and avian sources (4 –9).
all three activities of  xxxg1473xxx  are found in mammalian mitochondria as well (10, 11). our studies with intact
rat liver mitochondria and mitochondrial extracts demonstrated the ability of these organelles to oxidize carbon 3 of
serine to formate by a folate-dependent pathway (fig. 1, reactions 1– 4) (11). however, the existence, structure, and function
of the folate-interconverting activities of  xxxg1473xxx  in
mammalian mitochondria have been controversial. mackenzie
and co-workers (12, 13) characterized a bifunctional nad-dependent 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase/5,10-methenylthf cyclohydrolase, originally isolated from ascites tumor
cells. this bifunctional enzyme lacks the large c-terminal domain catalyzing the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity and
thus is unable to produce formate. this enzyme was shown to
be a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein (14, 15), detectable
only in transformed mammalian cells and embryonic or nondifferentiated tissues (12). among adult differentiated tissues,
nad-dependent 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity
is detectable only in rat adrenal tissue (16), although the
mrna encoding this enzyme is present at low levels in all
tissues examined (17). mackenzie and co-workers (18, 19) have

c1-tetrahydrofolate (thf) synthase is a trifunctional
enzyme found in eukaryotes that contains the activities
10-formyl-thf synthetase, 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase, and 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase. the
cytoplasmic isozyme of  xxxg1473xxx  is well characterized in a number of mammals, including humans; but
a mitochondrial isozyme has been previously identified
only in the yeast saccharomyces. here, we report the
identification and characterization of the human gene
encoding a functional mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx .
the gene spans 236 kilobase pairs on chromosome 6 and
consists of 28 exons plus one alternative exon. the gene
encodes a protein of 978 amino acids, including an nterminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. the mitochondrial isozyme is 61% identical to the human cytoplasmic isozyme. expression of the gene was detected in
most human tissues, but transcripts were highest in placenta, thymus, and brain. two mrnas were detected, a
3.6-kb transcript and a 1.1-kb transcript, and both transcripts were observed in varying ratios in each tissue.
the shorter transcript results from an alternative splicing event, where exon 7 is spliced to exon 8a instead of
exon 8. exon 8a is derived from an exonized alu sequence, sharing no homology with exon 8 of the long
transcript, and encodes just 15 amino acids followed by
a stop codon and a polyadenylation signal. this short
transcript potentially encodes a bifunctional enzyme
lacking 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity. both transcripts initiate at the same 5ⴕ-site, 107 nucleotides upstream of the atg start codon. the full-length (2934 bp)
cdna fused to a c-terminal v5 epitope tag was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells. immunoblots of
subfractionated cells revealed a 107-kda protein only in
the mitochondrial fractions of these cells, confirming
the mitochondrial localization of the protein. yeast cells
expressing the full-length human cdna exhibited elevated 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity, confirming its
identification as the human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase.

experimental procedures

materials—all chemicals were of the highest available commercial
quality. difco media components were obtained from vwr (west chester, pa). restriction enzymes, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, calf  xxxg149xxx , and t4 dna ligase were purchased from
invitrogen. primers for pcr and sequencing were made by idt (coralville, ia). [␣-32p] xxxd1148xxx  (3000 ci/mmol) was purchased from
perkinelmer life sciences.
construction of full-length cdna—a partial cdna clone
(dkfzp586g1517) constructed by the german genome project (rzpd
german research center for genome research) (20) was identified in
the genbanktm/ebi data bank (accession number al117452) by a
blast search using the cdna sequence of the human cytoplasmic
 xxxg1473xxx  (21). this cdna contains 390 nucleotides (nt) of
3⬘-noncoding sequence and a poly(a) tail, but lacks a start codon,
indicating that it is truncated at the 5⬘-end. the truncated cdna clone
was obtained from rzpd, and its sequence was confirmed by the dna
analysis facility of the university of texas (austin, tx). the human
genome database contains the entire gene corresponding to this cdna
and predicts an additional 5⬘-exon that encodes 60 additional n-terminal amino acids. the missing 5⬘-exon (exon 1) (see fig. 4) was pcramplified from a genomic p1 artificial chromosome clone (dj44a20)
obtained from the sanger centre (cambridge, uk). the pcr-amplified
product was gel-purified using a qiagen gel extraction kit and subcloned into the pgem-t easy vector (promega, madison wi), and its
sequence was verified. it was necessary to use masteramp tfl dna
polymerase (epicentre technologies corp., madison, wi) in the pcr
due to the high gc content of exon 1 (see “results”). the partial cdna
clone and the exon 1 clone were then used as templates in a splice
overlap extension (soe)-pcr (22) to produce the full-length cdna. the
exon 1 fragment (230 bp) was amplified using tfl polymerase and
primers topo5⬘ (5⬘-caccatgggcacgcgtctgccgctc-3⬘, with
the atg start codon underlined) and humitosoe3⬘ (5⬘-cttctctgacgatggagtcccg-3⬘). the 2719-bp cdna fragment was pcr-amplified using pfu polymerase and primers gs5⬘soe (5⬘-gggactccatcgtcagagaag-3⬘) and topo3⬘ (5⬘-gaacaagcctttaacttgttctgtttc-3⬘). primer topo3⬘ is complementary to the last nine
codons of the open reading frame before the stop codon. both products
were gel-purified using the qiagen gel extraction kit. the 230- and

2719-bp pcr products served as templates in the soe-pcr using
primers topo5⬘ and topo3⬘ and tfl polymerase. the full-length
cdna product (2934 bp) was gel-purified and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcdna3.1d/v5-his-topo (invitrogen) using directional topo cloning according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the topo cloning reaction was transformed into one-shot chemically
competent escherichia coli (invitrogen) by chemical transformation,
and positive colonies were selected on yt (0.5% yeast extract, 0.8%
tryptone, and 0.5% nacl) plates containing 50 ␮g/ml ampicillin. the
colonies were screened by pcr with a vector primer and a gene-specific
primer, and positive plasmids were prepared using a qiagen
miniplasmid preparation kit. sequence analysis revealed a base substitution in the full-length clone compared with the original cdna and
genomic sequences, presumably incorporated during the pcrs. (tfl
polymerase, which was chosen due to the high gc content of exon 1,
lacks a 3⬘ 3 5⬘ proofreading activity.) this substitution was repaired
using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene). the
repaired full-length cdna clone, pcdna3.1-humito, was sequenced
completely, and the correct sequence was confirmed (genbanktm/ebi
accession number ay374130).
cho cell transfection—cho cells (1.5 ⫻ 105) were plated on 35-mm
diameter dishes and cultured in ␣-minimal eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. duplicate plates were then
transfected with 2 ␮g of pcdna3.1-humito/plate using the lipofectamine 2000 reagent method (invitrogen). after transfection, cells
were cultured for an additional 48 h in regular medium before a g418containing selective medium (0.8 mg/ml) was applied. the selective
medium was applied for ⬃1 week until antibiotic-resistant colonies
developed. resistant colonies were picked, replated, cultured, and
collected.
preparation of cell homogenates and subcellular fractions—transfected cells were cultured in two 150-cm2 t-flasks to yield 1–2 ⫻ 108
cells. the monolayer was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (4 ⫻ 5
ml) at 4 °c and then incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm edta (10 ml) at room temperature until the cells detached
(5–10 min). the flasks were tapped gently to dislodge the cells, and the
cells were transferred to a 50-ml plastic conical tube. cells were pelleted
by centrifugation at 300 ⫻ g for 5 min at room temperature, and the cell
pellet was washed with 15 ml of homogenization solution (hms; 250
mm sucrose and 1 mm edta (ph 6.9)) at 4 °c. the cell pellet was
resuspended in hms (2 ml) at 4 °c, transferred to a kontes nitrogen
cavitation device, and exposed to a pressure of 36 p.s.i. for 30 min at
4 °c. the suspension of disrupted cells was collected into a 3-ml conical
ground-glass duall tissue grinder and further disrupted with four
strokes of the homogenizer (23).
nuclei and unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation at
900 ⫻ g for 6 min. the supernatant was removed carefully, transferred
to another centrifuge tube, and stored on ice. the pellet was resuspended in hms (1 ml) and further dispersed by four strokes in the
grinder. after centrifugation at 900 ⫻ g for 6 min, the supernatant was
combined with the first supernatant and stored on ice. the pellet was
washed with hms (3 ⫻ 1 ml), and the final viscous pellet (nuclear
fraction) was resuspended in hms (1 ml). the combined supernatants
were centrifuged at 900 ⫻ g for 5 min, and any pellet was discarded. the

argued that mammalian mitochondria lack a  xxxg1473xxx 
and that the bifunctional nad-dependent dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase is the mammalian homolog of the trifunctional
mitochondrial enzyme.
here, we report the identification and characterization of the
human gene encoding a functional mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx . we show that it is expressed widely in adult human
tissues and that the full-length cdna encodes a protein that
localizes to mitochondria when expressed in chinese hamster
ovary (cho) cells. these data confirm the existence of c1-thf
synthase in mammalian mitochondria, completing the folateinterconverting pathway shown in fig. 1.

for 30 min at 42 °c. the membrane was exposed to a storage phosphor
screen (amersham biosciences) for 48 h and imaged using an amersham biosciences 445 si phosphorimager. the same blot was stripped
and reconstituted for hybridization with each probe according to the kit
manufacturer’s instructions.
transcript mapping—the 5⬘- and 3⬘-ends of the transcripts were
mapped by rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends
using the firstchoice rlm-race kit from ambion inc. human placental total rna (ambion inc.) was used to map the 5⬘-end of the
transcript. nested antisense primers specific to the cdna were designed for use with the two nested 5⬘-race primers provided in the kit
(see fig. 6). the cdna-specific inner primer (gsi2, 5⬘-cgcctcgagacggctggttctcaggggacac-3⬘, with the xhoi site underlined) was complementary to nt ⫺9 to ⫺30 in the 5⬘-untranslated
region. the cdna-specific outer primer (gso2, 5⬘-agcgcgacagggcacacggag-3⬘) was complementary to nt ⫹93 to ⫹73. the
5⬘-race inner primer and the cdna-specific inner primer had bamhi
and xhoi sites, respectively, at their 5⬘-ends to facilitate cloning.
for mapping the 3⬘-end of the 1.1-kb transcript, first-strand cdna
was synthesized from human placental total rna using the supplied
3⬘-race adapter. nested sense primers specific to the cdna were
designed for use with the two nested 3⬘-race primers provided in the
kit. the cdna-specific inner primer (3⬘-race gsi, 5⬘-cgcctcgaggaacttgtttagcaacaaagtcct-3⬘, with the xhoi site underlined)
was equivalent to nt ⫹485 to ⫹508. the cdna-specific outer primer
(3⬘-race gso, 5⬘-cgcctcgagctccctccagatagcagtgaa-3⬘)
was equivalent to nt ⫹390 to ⫹410. the 3⬘-race inner primer and the
cdna-specific inner primer had bamhi and xhoi sites, respectively, at
their 5⬘-ends to facilitate cloning.
pcr fragments generated in the “inner” pcrs of both 5⬘- and 3⬘race were gel-purified, digested with bamhi and xhoi, and ligated
separately into bamhi/xhoi-digested pbluescript ii ks(⫹) vector
(stratagene, la jolla, ca). the ligation reactions were transformed into
chemically competent xl1-blue cells (stratagene), and positive colonies
were selected on yt/ampicillin plates. colonies were screened by pcr
using t7 reverse (5⬘-gtaatacgactcactatagggc-3⬘) and t3 forward (5⬘-aattaaccctcactaaaggg-3⬘) vector primers, and plasmids were prepared for sequence analysis. this 1.1-kb cdna has been
submitted to the genbanktm/ebi data bank under accession number
ay374131.
results

cdna identification and cloning—a cdna encoding an open
reading frame with high similarity to human cytoplasmic c1thf synthase was cloned from human uterine rna by the
german genome project (rzpd; genbanktm/ebi accession
number al117452). the homology extends the length of the
proteins, suggesting that the cdna encodes another trifunctional  xxxg1473xxx  (fig. 2). this cdna encodes 917 amino
acids plus 390 nt of 3⬘-noncoding sequence and a poly(a) tail,
but lacks a start codon, suggesting that it is truncated at the
5⬘-end. blasting this sequence against the human genome
database (ncbi protein database) revealed the corresponding
gene on chromosome 6 at 6q25.2. this gene spans 236 kilobase
pairs and encodes the entire cdna sequence in 27 exons plus
an additional 5⬘-exon that encodes 60 additional n-terminal
amino acids. the predicted initiator codon sits within a nearperfect expanded kozak consensus sequence (32). the first half
of this n-terminal extension has the characteristics of a mitochondrial leader sequence, including the potential to form a
positively charged amphipathic ␣-helix. truncation of the original cdna clone was due to the presence of a noti site near the
3⬘-end of the first exon; noti was used in the cdna cloning
procedure (20). subsequently, the riken mouse gene encyclopedia project (33) identified a full-length mouse cdna
(id22289) that predicts a protein with 88% identity to the
human protein, including the n-terminal extension (fig. 2).
the mouse cdna lacks the noti site that caused truncation of
the human cdna. these data suggest that the gene on human
chromosome 6 encodes a mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx .
attempts to construct a full-length cdna by race using
human uterine rna were unsuccessful, probably due to the
extremely high gc content (⬎80%) of the first exon. instead, a

volume of the supernatant (total post-nuclear supernatant fraction) was
increased to 5 ml by the addition of hms.
the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g for 15
min, and the pellet was stored on ice. the supernatant was recentrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g for 15 min to give a final supernatant (cytosolic
fraction). the second pellet was combined with the first, washed with
hms (2 ml), and resuspended in hms (1 ml) to give the mitochondrial
fraction. glutamate dehydrogenase activity (24) was used as a mitochondrial marker, and lactate dehydrogenase activity (25) was used as
a cytoplasmic marker.
immunoblotting—the protein concentration of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was determined using the bradford assay (26)
with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard. eighty ␮g of cytosolic and
mitochondrial protein from transfected and untransfected cho cells
were fractionated on a 7.5% sds-polyacrylamide gel for 50 min at 180
v. one-half of the gel was stained, and the proteins on the other half
were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (midwest scientific,
valley park, mo) by electroblotting for 90 min at 250 ma. the membrane was then washed with distilled water (3 ⫻ 5 min each) and
blocked in 2% dry milk in tris-buffered saline (tbs; 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
and 0.15 m nacl (ph 8.0)) for 1 h at room temperature. the blocked
membrane was incubated with mouse anti-v5 primary antibody (1:1000
dilution; invitrogen) diluted in tbs and 1% dry milk for 1 h at room
temperature. the membrane was then washed with tbs containing
0.0025% tween 20 (tbst; 3 ⫻ 5 min each) and incubated with goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution; zymed laboratories
inc., san francisco, ca) for 1 h at room temperature. the membrane
was finally washed with tbst and tbs (2 ⫻ 5 min each) and rinsed
with water before visualizing the bands. reacting bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ecl, amersham
bioscience).
expression in yeast and enzyme assays—the full-length human
cdna was subcloned from pcdna3.1-humito into the bamhi and xhoi
sites of the yeast expression vector pvt103u (27). in the resulting
construct, pvt-humito, the entire human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  open reading frame, including the mitochondrial presequence, is
expressed from the adh promoter of the vector. yeast strain day3
(ser1 ura3-52 trp1 leu2 ade3-130) (28) was transformed with pvthumito or empty pvt103u vector using a lithium acetate method (29)
modified as described.2 cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium,
and extracts were prepared and assayed for nad⫹- and nadp⫹-dependent methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity as described (30). 10formyl-thf synthetase activity was determined according to kirksey
and appling (31).
northern analysis—a firstchoice northern human blot i kit was
obtained from ambion inc. (austin, tx), with poly(a)⫹ mrna from the
following adult human tissues: brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, heart,
kidney, pancreas, liver, lung, spleen, and thymus. probes were synthesized by asymmetric pcr using reagents supplied in the kit and
[␣-32p] xxxd1148xxx  according to the kit manufacturer’s instructions. the two
probes represented the 5⬘- and 3⬘-ends of the putative mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx  cdna. the 5⬘-end probe was synthesized using
primer gs5⬘soe for the sense strand and primer gsi (5⬘-ccgctcgagcaaggcattgaggactttgttgct-3⬘) for the antisense strand.
this 304-bp probe covered nt ⫹215 to ⫹518. (the a of the atg start
codon is designated ⫹1.) the 3⬘-end probe was synthesized using
primer dra3 (5⬘-gatgcagtcccctgctatca-3⬘) for the sense
strand and primer topo3⬘ for the antisense strand. this 465-bp probe
covered nt ⫹2469 to ⫹2933, ending just before the stop codon.
a probe was also synthesized for detection of the human cytoplasmic
 xxxg1473xxx . the plasmid puc13/hs230 (obtained from dr. r. e.
mackenzie, mcgill university), which contains a 230-bp fragment near
the 3⬘-end of the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  cdna (21), was
linearized by digestion with saci. a linear pcr amplification method
(following the kit manufacturer’s instructions) was used to synthesize
the probe. the antisense primer used was 5⬘-gtaaaacgacggccagt-3⬘, which is complementary to the vector sequences flanking the
insert.
the membrane was subjected to a 1-h prehybridization at 42 °c with
ultrahyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (ambion inc.). the probe
was added at 106 cpm/ml of hybridization buffer and allowed to hybridize at 42 °c overnight in a roller bottle. the membrane was then
washed twice with northernmax low stringency wash solution (equivalent to 2⫻ ssc; ambion inc.) for 10 min at 42 °c and twice with
northernmax high stringency wash solution (equivalent to 0.1 ⫻ ssc)

human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx

genomic p1 artificial chromosome clone (dj44a20, sanger centre) was used to pcr-amplify the 5⬘-exon. this was then
spliced to the remaining cdna by soe-pcr to construct a
full-length cdna encoding the human protein (genbanktm/
ebi accession number ay374130).
cho cell expression and subcellular localization—to determine whether the protein encoded by this cdna is, in fact,
mitochondrial, we expressed the cdna in cho cells. the fulllength cdna was cloned into the mammalian expression vector
pcdna3.1d/v5-his-topo. this construct fused the 14-amino
acid v5 epitope and a his6 tag to the c terminus of the 2934-bp
coding region. expression of the insert in mammalian cells is
driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. the resulting plasmid, pcdna3.1-humito, was transfected into cho cells, and
 xxxg418xxx -resistant colonies were selected and grown. the cytosolic
and mitochondrial fractions from transfected and untransfected (control) cho cells were isolated as described under
“experimental procedures.” each fraction was assayed for the
mitochondrial marker enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase and
the cytoplasmic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. glutamate dehydrogenase activity ranged from 68 to 95 ␮mol/
min/mg of protein in the mitochondrial fractions, compared
with 2.4 – 4 ␮mol/min/mg of protein in the cytoplasmic fractions. the lactate dehydrogenase activity of the mitochondrial
fraction was only one-seventh that of the cytoplasmic fraction.
these subcellular fractions were then subjected to sds-page
and immunoblotting using antibodies against the v5 epitope
(fig. 3). a clear signal at ⬃107 kda was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of the transfected cho cell line (lane 2), but
not in the cytoplasmic fraction (lane 1). this mobility is consistent with the expected size of the epitope-tagged construct
(⬃1000 amino acids). no signal was seen in either fraction of
the untransfected cho cell line (lanes 3 and 4). these results

confirm that this cdna encodes a protein that localizes exclusively to mitochondria in a mammalian cell line.
expression in yeast—the full-length human mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx  cdna, including the 62-codon n-terminal
extension, was subcloned into a yeast expression vector
(pvt103u) and transformed into an ade3 deletion strain
(day3). disruption of the ade3 gene, which encodes the cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx , results in yeast cells with very low
10-formyl-thf synthetase and 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activities; the residual activity is due to the mitochondrial isozyme (34). day3 cells transformed with pvt-humito
overexpressed 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity ⬃9-fold compared with cells transformed with empty vector (64.6 versus 7.1
milliunits/mg of protein). however, we did not detect any increase in 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity in cells
carrying the pvt-humito plasmid using either nadp⫹ or
nad⫹ as cofactor. the third activity of  xxxg1473xxx , 5,10methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase, was not assayed because it is
difficult to accurately measure this activity in crude extracts.
these results, together with the mitochondrial localization
data above, confirm that this cdna encodes a protein with
10-formyl-thf synthetase activity, further supporting its identification as the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx .
gene structure—the human gene encoding  xxxg1473xxx  spans 236 kilobase pairs on chromosome 6 (fig. 4). the
coding sequence consists of 28 exons and is interrupted by 27
introns ranging from 89 to 55,350 bp in length. the start codon
is present in the first exon, and the 5⬘-end of exon 1 extends 107
bp upstream of the atg start codon (see “transcript mapping”
below). the stop codon is present in exon 27, and exon 28
encodes 360 nt of 3⬘-untranslated region, including a polyadenylation signal (aataaa). exon 1 is very gc-rich (⬎80%
gc), containing a cpg island and a noti restriction enzyme

the cloning of a full-length cdna because noti linkers were
used in the cloning procedure (20). all of the intron/exon splice
sites follow the gt/ag rule (35), except after the terminal
exons, 8a and 28 (table i). a scan of the 5⬘-flanking sequences
by the tess web server3 using the transfac version 4.0
database predicts numerous potential transcription factorbinding sites, including sp1,  xxxd3417xxx  receptor-␣1, and

contains a tataaa sequence at position ⫺985.
northern analysis—a northern blot membrane prebound
with human poly(a) rna from several tissues was obtained
from ambion inc. a 304-bp 5⬘-end probe spanning nt 215–518
of the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  cdna revealed
two bands: one at ⬃3.6 kb and the other at ⬃1.1 kb (fig. 5a).
the upper band corresponded to the expected size of the fulllength transcript. to ensure that the 1.1-kb band was not an
artifact, we washed the membrane for an additional 30 min
with high stringency wash buffer at 50 °c. the additional wash
did not eliminate either band. the upper and lower band distributions were very similar, with the highest transcript levels
being in placenta, thymus, and brain. expression was low in
liver and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in heart.
to determine the relationship of the 3.6- and 1.1-kb transcripts, a 465-bp probe was synthesized that ended just before
the stop codon. this 3⬘-probe detected only the 3.6-kb transcript (fig. 5b), suggesting that the 1.1-kb transcript represents just the 5⬘-end of the cdna.
we also compared the tissue distribution of the mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  transcript with that of the cytoplasmic
isozyme. using a 230-bp probe from the 3⬘-end of the cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  cdna (21), a 3.3-kb transcript was observed (fig. 5c). the tissue distribution of this transcript differed from that of the mitochondrial isozyme, being highest in
liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. thus, the human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  isozymes are encoded
by distinct transcripts that do not cross-hybridize under these
probe and wash conditions.

discussion

the experiments described here confirm that humans express a mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx , with properties very
similar to those of the cytoplasmic homologs previously characterized. the full-length human cdna encodes a protein of
978 amino acids, including an n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. when the full-length cdna was expressed in
cho cells, the targeting sequence directed the protein exclusively to mitochondria (fig. 3). alignment of the deduced amino
acid sequence with the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx 
(935 residues) reveals a 62-residue n-terminal extension in the
putative mitochondrial protein (fig. 2). psort ii analysis4

of total protein.

␮g of human placental total rna for first-strand cdna synthesis by reverse transcription. this was followed by a first
round of pcr (outer pcr), which gave no detectable specific
product. two ␮l of the outer pcr product were used in a second
round of pcr with nested primers (inner pcr), yielding a
specific product of ⬍300 bp. the final pcr product was gelpurified and subcloned. nine colonies were screened by pcr,
and all of them gave a product of between 220 and 298 bp.
three of the nine clones were sequenced, and all of them
exhibited the same 5⬘-end 107 bp upstream of the atg start
codon (fig. 6). these results suggest that the majority of the
transcripts from this gene initiate at or near position ⫺107,
and it appears that both the 3.6- and 1.1-kb transcripts initiate
from this site.
alternative splicing—a 3⬘-race experiment was performed
to determine the 3⬘-end of the short 1.1-kb transcript observed
on northern blots (fig. 5a). one ␮g of human placental total
rna was used for first-strand cdna synthesis. this was followed by a first round of pcr (outer pcr), which gave no
detectable specific race product. one ␮l of the outer pcr
product was used in a second round of pcr with nested primers
(inner pcr). four distinct pcr products of 500, 350, 200, and
100 bp were detectable on a 2% agarose gel. (a smear at the top
of the gel was also observed, produced from the full-length
transcript.) based on the 1.1-kb length of the short transcript
and the position of the inner primer, the 500- and 350-bp race
products were gel-purified and cloned separately. six of the
clones were sequenced to determine the 3⬘-extent of the clones.
all of these clones represented the short transcript, in which
exon 7 is spliced to a previously unrecognized exon, termed
exon 8a, which sits in the intron between exons 7 and 8 (fig.
7a). exon 8a appears to be 139 bp long, although in one clone,
the 3⬘-end extended 162 bp. it contains a stop codon after 45
nucleotides and a polyadenylation signal near its 3⬘-end. thus,
the 3.6- and 1.1-kb transcripts share the first seven exons and
then diverge at exon 8/8a. the 1.1-kb transcript would be
translated into a 275-amino acid protein in which the first 260
amino acids are identical to the full-length protein, followed by
15 unrelated amino acids (genbanktm/ebi accession number
ay374131) (fig. 7, b and c).
an additional variation was observed upon sequencing the
3⬘-race clones. several of the clones contained an extra codon
at position ⫹643, at the junction between exons 6 and 7 (fig. 8).
this extra valine codon appears to arise from variation in the
3⬘-splice acceptor site during the splicing of exon 6 to exon 7.
the 5⬘-splice site has the gt consensus sequence as the first 2
nt of the intron. the 3⬘-splice site has two ag consensus
dinucleotides at the 3⬘-end of the intron. if the first ag dinucleotide is used, exon 7 contains 3 additional nt; if the second is
used, these 3 nt are not present in exon 7.

a very similar n-terminal extension is predicted for the mouse
protein (fig. 2). excluding this n-terminal extension, homology
to the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  is quite high (61%
identity), and the putative mitochondrial protein appears to
possess the same domain structure. in the cytoplasmic protein,
the n-terminal dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain is ⬃300

residues, and the c-terminal synthetase domain is ⬃700 residues (9). the two human proteins share 31% identity in the
dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domains and 73% identity in the
synthetase domains, including conserved active-site residues
and the 10-formyl-thf-binding site in the synthetase domain
(31). however, the putative mitochondrial proteins from human and mouse lack 12 amino acids near the junction between
the two domains (position 318) (fig. 2).

human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 

expression of the full-length cdna in yeast revealed elevated 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity, further supporting
its identification as the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx . we were unable to detect increased 5,10-methylene-thf
dehydrogenase activity in these cells using either nadp⫹ or
nad⫹ as cofactor. is the human mitochondrial enzyme multifunctional like its yeast counterpart? given the low identity
between the human cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isozymes in
the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain (31%), it is conceivable that the mitochondrial protein has lost these activities.
however, other members of this family have diverged as much
or more (e.g. yeast mtd1p (30)) and still retain 5,10-methylenethf dehydrogenase activity. another possibility is that the
dehydrogenase activity of the human enzyme is simply below
detection in crude yeast extracts. depending on the species, the
dehydrogenase activity of these trifunctional enzymes is only
one-half to one-tenth that of the synthetase activity (2–9).
finally, the construct we expressed in yeast contained the
entire 62-amino acid n-terminal extension. the 10-formyl-thf
synthetase activity was found in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, but not in the mitochondrial fraction (data not shown),
suggesting that the presequence was not processed. if it is
retained, this extension could interfere with the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase activities contained in the n-terminal domain of the protein while leaving the c-terminal synthetase
domain unaffected. these questions will have to await purification of the recombinant enzyme.
expression of the gene was detected in most human tissues,
but transcripts were highest in placenta, thymus, and brain.
expression was low in liver and skeletal muscle and barely
detectable in heart. a mouse cdna has also been identified

that predicts a protein with 88% identity to the human protein,
including the n-terminal extension, suggesting that this mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  will be found in all mammals.
the human gene encoding this enzyme has several interesting features. the gene is large, spanning 236 kilobase pairs on
chromosome 6 at 6q25.2. the gene contains 29 exons (table i),
including the alternative exon 8a found in the intron between
exons 7 and 8 (fig. 4). this same intron/exon structure is
observed for the mouse homolog found on mouse chromosome
10, except that the alternative exon 8a is absent in the mouse
gene. moreover, the genes for the cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx 
from rat, mouse, and human have all been shown to contain 28
exons, with introns in nearly identical positions (36, 37). this
suggests that an ancestral  xxxg1473xxx  gene arose before
the divergence of the human and rodent lineages, ⬎75 million
years ago (38), and genes encoding the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes are probably related by a gene duplication
event.
the full-length 3.6-kb transcript is encoded in 28 exons. a
shorter, 1.1-kb transcript is produced by an alternative splicing
event, in which exon 7 is spliced to exon 8a instead of exon 8
(fig. 7). this transcript encodes a 275-amino acid protein in
which the first 260 amino acids are identical to the full-length
protein, followed by 15 amino acids not found in any other
 xxxg1473xxx . the first 11 amino acids of these 15 terminal
amino acids are also found, with one mismatch, near the c
terminus of isoform 2 of the human ␣1a-adrenergic receptor,
and the nucleotide sequence encoding these amino acids has
high homology to an alu repeat subfamily (39). the first 91 nt
of exon 8a share 87% identity with the right half of the consensus alu-sc subfamily (genbanktm/ebi accession number
u14571), suggesting that exon 8a was derived from an alu
element that inserted, in the antisense orientation, into the
intron between exons 7 and 8. this insertion is not present in
the mouse homolog because alu elements are found only in
primates (40). the exonization and alternative splicing of this
alu sequence in the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
gene are apparently due to accumulated mutations in the alu
element that produce a functional 3⬘-splice site (41).
assuming the short transcript is translated in vivo, it is
unlikely that the resulting protein would retain 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase or 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase
activity. modeling the human mitochondrial protein sequence
onto the x-ray structure of the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase
domain of the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  (42) reveals that exons 8 and 9, which are missing in the short
transcript, encode the major portion of the rossman fold of the
nadp-binding site and a critical ␣-helix that forms one wall of
the folate-binding site. it is likely that a truncated protein
lacking these structural elements would not fold into a stable
structure and would be rapidly degraded. however, without
knowing how the 15 novel amino acids affect the structure, it
remains possible that a stable protein with altered function
could be produced. experiments are underway to determine
whether a truncated form of the protein is expressed in vivo.
using rna from human placenta, a single 5⬘-transcriptional
start site at position ⫺107 was identified by 5⬘-race (fig. 6).
it appears that both the 3.6- and 1.1-kb transcripts initiate
from this site because only a single 5⬘-end was identified. a
blast search of the human est database with the 5⬘-end of
the human cdna revealed ⬎100 entries. four ests extended
beyond position ⫺107 (fig. 6). bg481636 (position ⫺276) and
be735249 (position ⫺268) were isolated from choriocarcinoma
mrna; bq062382 (position ⫺119); and bq055629 (position
⫺118) were isolated from a lymphoma cell line. thus, it appears there may be some heterogeneity in the 5⬘-transcrip-

tional start site, depending on the tissue or cell type.
one additional splicing variation was discovered. some transcripts contained an extra codon at position ⫹643, at the junction between exons 6 and 7 (fig. 8). this valine codon appears
to arise from alternative usage of ag splice acceptor sites
separated by 1 nt. this type of variation in splice site selection
has been seen in several other mammalian genes, including
human prothymosin-␣ (43) and the rat transforming growth
factor-␤ type i receptor (44). the extra codon was observed in
most of the 3⬘-race clones we sequenced and can be found in
numerous human ests that represent the full-length transcript. there is no evidence to suggest that this alternative
splice site selection is a regulated process. it may simply be due
to “sloppiness” in the splicing mechanism when two ag splice
acceptor sites fall so closely together.
based on the x-ray structure of the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain of the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx 
(42), the extra valine is predicted to reside on the exposed loop

between ␣-helix d2 and ␤-strand e. this loop is not part of the
dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase active site or the dimerization
interface for this domain. it is thus possible that an extra
valine at this position could be tolerated without affecting
stability or activity of the protein. on the other hand, we do not
know how the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase and synthetase
domains interact, so it will be necessary to express the protein
containing the extra valine to determine its effect.
the tissue distribution of the mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  is quite different from that of the cytoplasmic isozyme
(fig. 5). whereas the cytoplasmic transcript is most abundant
in liver and kidney, the transcripts for the mitochondrial
isozyme are relatively low in those tissues, but highest in
placenta, followed by thymus, spleen, brain, and lung. the low
expression of the mitochondrial isozyme in liver probably contributed to our earlier difficulties in purifying the protein from
liver mitochondria. although the ratio of the two transcripts
varies somewhat from tissue to tissue, both are present in
every tissue assayed, even heart (fig. 5). the short transcript is
significantly reduced in brain. future work will be directed
toward understanding the metabolic role of the mitochondrial
isozyme and how that role relates to the observed tissue
distribution.
the discovery of the human gene for this mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx  confirms our model for the compartmentation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in mammalian
cells (fig. 1). based on the well documented existence of a
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  in yeast (3, 45), we proposed
that mammalian mitochondria also contain this trifunctional
enzyme (10). all three activities of  xxxg1473xxx  are found
in mammalian mitochondria (10). more importantly, intact rat
liver mitochondria and mitochondrial extracts were shown to
oxidize carbon 3 of serine to formate by the folate-dependent
pathway outlined in fig. 1 (mitochondrial reactions 1– 4) (11).
however, all our attempts to purify these activities from rat
liver mitochondria were unsuccessful.

alternative exon 8a is in the intron between exons 7 and 8. in the 3.6-kb transcript, exon 7 is spliced to exon 8. in the 1.1-kb transcript, exon 7 is
spliced to exon 8a. exon 8a contains a stop codon (black dot) after 15 sense codons and contains a polyadenylation signal (aataaa) near its 3⬘-end.
there is no homology between exons 8a and 8. b, potential protein products. the long transcript is translated into a 978-amino acid protein,
whereas the short transcript is translated into a 275-amino acid protein. the amino acid sequences of the two proteins are identical through the
first seven exons, encoding 260 amino acids. the short protein has 15 amino acids from exon 8a in place of the amino acids encoded by exon 8. the
junction between the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (d/c) and synthetase (syn) domains is predicted to lie within amino acids 330 –350 (fig. 2).

cytoplasmic reactions to the 5-methyl-thf required for homocysteine remethylation. consistent with this explanation is the
observation that gcs activity is stimulated by glucagon (53),
and glucagon lowers plasma homocysteine in rats (54), presumably by increasing the mitochondrial production of formate. an
elegant stable isotope study in humans (55) provides further
support for the role of mitochondrial one-carbon units in the
remethylation of homocysteine. gregory et al. (55) showed that
both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial one-carbon units end up in
the methyl group of methionine following infusion of deuterated serine. this result strongly supports mitochondrial formate production as a significant contributor to cytoplasmic
one-carbon units in vivo in mammals and places the mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  in the center of this pathway.

ent 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase/5,10-methenyl-thf
cyclohydrolase, originally isolated from ascites tumor cells.
this bifunctional enzyme lacks the large c-terminal domain
catalyzing the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity and thus is
unable to produce formate. when this enzyme was shown to be
localized in mitochondria (14, 15), mackenzie and co-workers
(18, 19) proposed that mammalian mitochondria lack a trifunctional  xxxg1473xxx  and that this bifunctional nad-dependent dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase is the mammalian
homolog of the trifunctional mitochondrial enzyme. there are,
however, several problems with this proposal. first, the bifunctional enzyme is detectable mainly in transformed mammalian
cells and embryonic or non-differentiated tissues (12). among
adult differentiated tissues, nad-dependent 5,10-methylenethf dehydrogenase activity is detectable only in rat adrenal
tissue, but not adult liver (16). second, the 5,10-methylenethf dehydrogenase activity we detected in rat liver mitochondria is dependent on nadp⫹, not nad⫹ (11). finally, adult rat
liver mitochondria are capable of producing formate by the
folate-dependent pathway (11), and formate production requires the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity (fig. 1, reaction
1) that is missing from the bifunctional enzyme. clearly, only a
trifunctional  xxxg1473xxx , with an nadp-dependent 5,10methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity, is consistent with the
biochemical data.
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  probably supports several
metabolic processes in mammalian mitochondria. folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is involved in the synthesis of
formyl-methionyl-trna for mitochondrial protein synthesis
(fig. 1, reaction 8) (46, 47) and the oxidation of choline methyl
groups via dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase (48). mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  may also play
an important role in homocysteine metabolism. recent studies
of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia reveal a connection between the mitochondrially localized glycine cleavage
system (gcs) (fig. 1, reaction 5) and homocysteine metabolism. nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an autosomal recessive
brain disease caused by defects in subunits of the gcs, resulting in elevated glycine levels (49). loss of gcs activity might
be expected to cause, in addition to elevated glycine, a deficiency of mitochondrial one-carbon units. consistent with this
hypothesis, two recent studies report mild elevations of homocysteine in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of nonketotic
hyperglycinemia patients (50, 51). furthermore, randak et al.
(51) found that the mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels
could be reduced in their three patients by treatment with the
one-carbon donor 5-formyl-thf ( xxxd2147xxx ,  xxxd2462xxx ). this
observation provides strong evidence that the homocysteine
elevations are due to a defect in homocysteine remethylation
resulting from a deficiency of one-carbon units. examination of
fig. 1 suggests two ways in which a loss of mitochondrial gcs
activity could cause a deficiency of cytoplasmic one-carbon
units. first, as suggested by van hove et al. (50), cells lacking
a functional gcs might increase the transport of serine into
mitochondria for metabolism by serine hydroxymethyltransferase to compensate for the deficiency of mitochondrial 5,10methylene-thf. this could, in turn, cause a deficiency of serine, and thus one-carbon units, in the cytoplasm. a second
possibility is that formate production is defective in mitochondria from nonketotic hyperglycinemia patients. as we showed
both in vitro with rat liver mitochondria (10, 11), and in vivo
with yeast (28, 52), mitochondrial 5,10-methylene-thf is rapidly converted to formate and transported to the cytosol, where
it is activated to 10-formyl-thf via cytoplasmic 10-formyl-thf
synthetase (fig. 1, mitochondrial reactions 3, 2, and 1 and
cytoplasmic reaction 1). the 10-formyl-thf is then reduced by
