cell itinerary and metabolic fate of  xxxg1193xxx  in rat liver: in vivo and in vitro studies.   xxxg1193xxx , the  xxxd2364xxx  in pancreatic beta-cells, displays a slower hepatic clearance than insulin and exerts a more prolonged metabolic effect on liver in vivo. to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these differences, the cellular itinerary and processing of  xxxg1193xxx  and insulin in rat liver have been comparatively studied using cell fractionation. as [125i]-insulin, [125i]- xxxg1193xxx  taken up into liver in vivo was internalized and accumulated in endosomes, in which it underwent dissociation from the  xxxg1194xxx  and degradation in a ph- and atp-dependent manner. however, relative to [125i]-insulin, [125i]- xxxg1193xxx  showed a delayed and prolonged in vivo association with endosomes, a slower in vivo and cell-free endosomal processing, and a higher cell-free endosome-lysosome transfer. endosomal extracts degraded to a lesser extent  xxxg1193xxx  than insulin at acidic ph; so did, and even proportionally less, at neutral ph, plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions.  xxxg1193xxx  degradation products generated by soluble endosomal extracts were isolated by hplc and characterized by mass spectrometry. under conditions resulting in multiple cleavages in insulin,  xxxg1193xxx  was cleaved at eight bonds in the c peptide but only at the phe24-phe25 bond in the insulin moiety. as native insulin, native  xxxg1193xxx  induced a dose- and time-dependent endocytosis and tyrosine phosphorylation of the  xxxg1194xxx ; but at an inframaximal dose,  xxxg1193xxx  effects on these processes were of longer duration. we conclude that a reduced proteolysis of  xxxg1193xxx  in endosomes, and probably also at the plasma membrane, accounts for its slower hepatic clearance and prolonged effects on  xxxg1194xxx  endocytosis and tyrosine phosphorylation.
