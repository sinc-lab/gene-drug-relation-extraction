abstract
objectives: the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between
 xxxg468xxx  (muscle-specific creatine kinase) gene polymorphism and the effects of
endurance training on running economy. methods: 102 biologically unrelated male
recruitments from northern china performed a 5000 m running program, with an
intensity of 95-105% ventilatory threshold (vt). the protocol was 3 times per week and
lasted for 18 weeks. running economy (re) indexes were determined by having the
subjects run on a treadmill before and after the protocol, and the a/g polymorphism in
3’ untranslated region of  xxxg468xxx  was detected by pcr-rflp (ncoi restriction enzyme).
results: three expected genotypes for  xxxg468xxx -ncoi (aa, ag and gg) were
observed in the subjects. after training, all re indexes declined markedly. moreover,
vo2revo2re/wvo2re/lbwvere in ag groups were larger than those in aa
and gg groups. conclusions: the findings as noted above indicated that the  xxxg468xxx 
gene polymorphism might contribute to individual re responses to endurance training.
key words:  xxxg468xxx  gene polymorphism, endurance training, running economy
introduction
the  xxxg468xxx  enzyme is bound specifically to the m-line of the myofibril subfragment,
1
one of heavy meromyosin in the vicinity of the myosin atpase and to the
sarcoplasmic reticulum outer membrane and vesicles,2 which might change the ca2+
reassembling 3 and power of muscle. type i (slow-twitch) skeletal muscle fibers and
type ii (fast-twitch) fibers have been shown to differ in their  xxxg468xxx  activities, where
type i fibers demonstrate at least a two-fold lower  xxxg468xxx  activity.4 skeletal muscles
of athletes involved in endurance performance are characterized by a high proportion
of type i fibers as well as by high activity levels of marker enzymes of the
aerobic-oxidative metabolism.5 therefore, the lower activity of  xxxg468xxx  might be essential to
endurance athletes.

running economy (re) is typically defined as the energy demand for a given
velocity of submaximal running, and is determined by measuring the steady-state
consumption of oxygen (vo2) and the respiratory exchange ratio.6 taking body mass
into consideration, runners with good re use less energy and therefore less oxygen
than runners with poor re at the same velocity.7 there is a strong association between
re and distance running performance.8-10
the  xxxg468xxx  gene has been mapped to the q13.2-q13.3 region of chromosome 19.11
there are now several lines of evidences that suggest that the  xxxg468xxx -ncoi
polymorphism in the 3’untranslated region might contribute to the individual
differences in vo2max responses to endurance training.12-13 lucia and co-workers,
however, detected  xxxg468xxx -ncoi polymorphism in 50 top-level spanish professional
cyclists and 119 sedentary controls, and no statistical differences were found for
 xxxg468xxx -ncoi polymorphism between athletes and controls.14 recently, we found that
the  xxxg468xxx -ncoi polymorphism in the 3’untranslated region was a/g variant by
sequencing, and there were significant differences in the allelic frequencies and
genotypic frequencies between chinese han population and those in europe and
america.15 moreover, less is known concerning the association between  xxxg468xxx -ncoi

polymorphism and individual re responses to endurance training. the purpose of this
study, therefore, was to explore the potential relationship between the  xxxg468xxx  gene
a/g polymorphism in chinese and re responses to a 18-week 5000m training
program.
materials and methods
subjects
the sample consisted of 102 biologically unrelated healthy male recruitments from
northern china, who had no experience of endurance training. the mean age was
18.8±0.9 years, the height was 171.8±5.8 cm, and the weight was 60.2±6.6 kg. written
informed consent was obtained from each participant.
training protocol
the subjects underwent a distance running program, which consisted of 5000 m
running 3 times per week lasting for 18 weeks. the heartrate sporttesters (s810finland)
were used to maintain constant training heart rates corresponding to ventilatory
threshold (vt). during the initial 10 weeks, the subjects were trained at a heart rate
associated with intensity of 95% vt. then, they were trained at a heart rate associated
with intensity of 105% vt during 11-18 week. the subjects hadn’t experienced other
endurance training except that.
re and vt measurement
before and after the training program, re and vt were measured with an automated
metabolic measurement cart (erich jaeger, germany). the protocol was that, the
subjects ran at a speed of 7.5km/h (grade 0%) for 2 min after 5 min warming up on the
treadmill. then the load increased gradually to 10.0km/h for 2 min, and 12.0km/h for 5
min. after that, the speed increased by 0.5 km/h and 2% grade every minute until
volitional exhaustion was reached. the stable vo2 during the 5 min running at the
speed of 12.0km/h were used for re (vo2re). the minute ventilatory volume (ve)
oxygen uptake (vo2) and carbon dioxide volume output (vco2) were used to
determine vt during the running, when the ve  vco2 and ve/vo2 appeared
ventilatory breakpoint.16 = (after training - before training)/before training*100%.
genotype analysis
dna was extracted from blood cells by a protocol recommended by the kit
manufacturer (promega, usa). primer pairs for pcr-rflp of the  xxxg468xxx  gene
polymorphism were designed by primer 5.0 software:
forward:
5' gggatgctcagactcacaga 3'
reverse:
5' aacttgaatttagcccaacg 3'
the amplification protocol was: 1) one cycle of denaturation at 94°c for 5 min; 2) 30
cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 40 s, annealing at 50°c for 40 s, and extension at
72°c for 60 s; and 3) one final 10 min elongation cycle at 72°c. preventive
contamination measures were taken by the inclusion of pcr reaction mixture without
dna (negative control). after each amplification, the pcr product was digested by
8u restriction enzyme ncoi (takara, japan) for 5h at 37. the allele without the ncoi
restriction site was designated as 359 bp, while the allele with the ncoi site was
designated as 206 + 153 bp. the resulting fragments were separated by horizontal
3

-4-

electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. each gel was run for 40 min at 100v, stained with
ethidium bromide, and photographed under uv transmitted lights. the puc19
dna/mspi (hpaii) marker, 23mbi, usa was used as length marker to estimate the
size of the digested dna fragments.
statistical analysis
the pearson chi-square was used to determine whether the observed genotype
frequencies were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the pair t-test was used to examine
variables differences before and after training. differences in variables between the
three genotypes were tested by one-way anova: post hoc multiple comparisons.
these tests were performed with spss software for windows 11.5 package. p values
<0.05 were considered statistically significant. the results are presented as means±se.
results
the three expected genotypes for  xxxg468xxx -ncoi (aa, ag and gg) were obtained
(fig 1). the observed genotypic frequencies of  xxxg468xxx -ncoi were 72% (aa), 26%
(ag) and 2% (gg), respectively, and in agreementp>0.05with those expected under
hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
table 1 showed that all re variables decreased significantly after training.
the association between the  xxxg468xxx -ncoi genotype and re variables was
summarized in table2. no significant differences were found in baseline re variables
among three genotypes before training, but the vo2revo2re/wvo2re/lbw and
vere in ag all decreased more significantly than those in aa and gg after
training.

discussion
the present study was first to investigate the association between  xxxg468xxx  gene
polymorphism and the effects of endurance training on running economy, and the
study demonstrated that all re variables decreased significantly after training than
those before the training, so re was improved. the most important finding of this
study was the significant association between the a/g polymorphism in 3’untranslated
region of  xxxg468xxx  gene and re response to endurance training. the heterozygotes with
ag genotype showed the larger vo2re vo2re/w vo2re/lbw vere than
those of the other two genotypes.(fig2)
previous research has indicated that the a/g polymorphism in the 3' untranslated
region of the muscle-specific creatine kinase gene was associated with vo2max to
endurance training. rivera12 analysed the  xxxg468xxx  gene a/g polymorphism among
caucasian participants from the heritage family study (160parents and 80 adult
offspring), and found the significant association between the  xxxg468xxx  gene a/g
polymorphism and vo2max in the sedentary state, as well as its response
(
vo2max) to a standardized 20-wk endurance training program. the heterozygotes
with ag genotype showed a larger  vo2max than that in the gg genotype.
following that, a significant linkage was found between  xxxg468xxx  gene a/g
polymorphism and vo2max in response to 20 weeks of endurance training in 277
full sib-pairs from 98 nuclear families of the heritage family study. 13
the strong relationship between re and distance running performance has been
demonstrated by many independent reports.8-10 conley and krahenbuhl8 showed that
re was a good predictor of performance in runners of comparable ability. in their
study, 12 highly trained male distance runners  vo2max ~72ml/kg/min and
10kmperformance ~32 minuteswere tested 3-6days after they had competed in a
10km race. there were significant correlations between submaximal vo2 and
performance at running speeds of 14, 16 and 18km/h. some 65% of the variation in
race performance could be attributed to differences in re, with the more economical
runners performing the best. the more economical runners were able to run at a lower
percentage of their vo2max, resulting in lower la at a given speed. the latter factor is
closely associated with the pace a runner is able to maintain for races > 15 minutes.17

several studies reported that endurance training has been shown to improve re in
untrained and moderately trained subjects, with trained runners having a better re
than their untrained or less trained counter parts. 18-20
the genotypic effects underlying individual differences in trainability may arise
from dna sequence polymorphisms that translate in gene product polymorphism or
variation in gene expression. the  xxxg468xxx  gene a/g polymorphism examined in this
study lies in 3’untranslated region, 21 which has been found to influence the
intracellular localization of its mrna, and may impact on its stability and the rate of
transcription, leading to differences in its expression. 22 and endurance performance is
influenced by type i fibers known for their high activity level of oxidative enzymes,
along with a low  xxxg468xxx  activity. 5 in addition, research on transgenic mice indicates
an improved endurance performance in the  xxxg468xxx  knock-out mice compared with
that seen in control animals. 23 thus, there was some indirect support for the hypothesis
that  xxxg468xxx  activity plays a role in limiting endurance performance and its
responsiveness to endurance training.
the homozygote for gg was the less frequently observed (2%), which was different
from the europeans or the americans (p<0.05), but had little difference from japanese
(p<0.05). we found that there were differences of races and regions in the a/g
polymorphism in 3’untranslated region of  xxxg468xxx  gene between asian and other
ethnic groups. 15
conclusion
the findings demonstrated that the a/g polymorphism in  xxxg468xxx  gene might
contribute to individual response to endurance training. vo2re vo2re/wvo2re/lbw
and vere declined more significantly in subjects with ag genotype compared to those
with aa or gg after endurance training.
