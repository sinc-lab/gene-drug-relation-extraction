received 4 september 1989, accepted 3 october 1989

the k d value of [3h]ym-09151-2, a potent and highly selective dopamine d-2 antagonist, for binding to rat
striatum was about 20 pm (half of that for [3h]spiperone and one-fiftieth of that for [3h]raclopride), the bmax of
[3h]ym-09151-2 binding was about 30% higher than that of [3h]raclopride or [3]spiperone. the ratio (about 3%) of
non-specific to specific binding of [3h]ym-09151-2 was smaller than that of [3h]spiperone and [3h]raclopride. the
hill coefficient values of dopamine d-2 antagonists, sch23390,  xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2914xxx  for the inhibition of
binding of [3h]ym-09151-2 were near 1.0, and their k i values with [3h]ym-09151-2 were consistent with those for
inhibiting [3h]raclopride and [3h]spiperone binding to d-2 receptors. thus, [3h]ym-09151-2 may be the most
suitable ligand for the labelling of dopamine d-2 receptors in the brain.

1. introduction

a high correlation of anti-schizophrenic action
and antagonistic action of the dopamine d-2 receptor has been reported for neuroleptics (seeman, 1980). regulation of prolactin release from
the pituitary by d-2 receptors has also been demonstrated. among various radioligands for dopamine d-2 receptors, [3h]spiperone has been widely
used due to its high affinity (k d = below 0.1 nm)
for the receptors. [3h]spiperone binds primarily to
d-2 receptors in the striatum, but primarily to
serotonin or aa-adrenoceptors in the other brain
regions (list and seeman 1981; withy et al., 1981;
terai et al., 1983).

ym-09151-2, (_+)-cis-n-(1-benzyl-2-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylamino benzamide (table 1) is a novel dopamine d-2
receptor antagonist neuroleptic with highly selective and potent affinity (k~ =0.1 nm) for d-2
receptors (grewe et al., 1982; terai et al., 1983;
fleminger et al., 1983; madras et al., 1988;
sumiyoshi et al., 1988). niznik et al. (1985) reported that the affinity of [3h]ym-09151-2 to
canine striatal membranes was k a = 60 pm, suggesting that [3h]ym-09151-2 would be useful as a
radioligand for dopamine d-2 receptors. hatano
et al. (1989) also reported the in vivo binding of
[t1c]ym-09151-2 to brain tissue of rats and dogs.
although chivers et al. (1988) reported that the
selectivity of raclopride is higher than that of
ym-09151-2, the affinity of [3h]raclopride for
dopamine d-2 receptors is comparatively low (ka
-- 1.0 nm; kohler et al., 1985). no comparison of
[3h]ym-09151-2 binding and [3h]raclopride binding was reported. we therefore investigated the

3. results

as shown in figs. 1 and 2, the b.... values of
[3h]ym-09151-2, [3h]spiperone and [3h]raclopride for dopamine d-2 receptors in rat striatum
were 418 _+ 9, 326 _+ 8 and 325 _+ 6 f m o l / m g protein, respectively. the k d values of these radioligands were 21.2 _+ 1.1, 38.1 _+ 2.5 and 1130 + 40
pm, respectively, and the hill values were 1.15,
1.09 and 1.01, respectively. as shown in fig. 3, the
ratios of non-specific binding to specific binding
of [3h]ym-09151-2,
[3h]spiperone and
[3h]raclopride were calculated to be 2.9, 14.7 and
8.9%, respectively. the bmax value of [3h]ym09151-2 binding to rat cerebellum was only about
4 f m o l / m g protein, which is 1% of the value for
striatum.
as shown in table 2, various d-2 receptor
agonists and antagonists, including the n-desmethyl metabolite (m-l) of ym-09151-2 (see fig.
4, higuchi et al., 1986) and two enantiomers of
ym-09151-2, inhibited [3h]ym-09151-2 binding
potently. high concentrations of 8-hydroxy-dpat
(5-ht]a agonist),  xxxd2637xxx  (5-ht 2 antagonist)
and  xxxd2914xxx  (a-blocker) were however required for inhibition. six compounds, m-3 (urinary
metabolite of ym-09151-2 in humans),  xxxd2746xxx  (an inhibitor of dopamine re-uptake), metham-

100

phetamine, cocaine, (-)-butaclamol and quipazine, at the concentrations of 10 t~m were unable
to inhibit [3h]ym-09151-2 binding to rat striatum
membranes. the slope values for the inhibition by
dopamine d-2 antagonists,  xxxd2637xxx , sch23390,
 xxxd2914xxx  and metabolites of ym-09151-2
were near 1.0.
as shown in fig. 5a and b, the k~ values for
the inhibition by six dopamine d-2 antagonists,
the metabolite of ym-09151-2 (m-5), sch-23390,
 xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2914xxx  of [3h]ym-09151-2
binding to rat striatum were consistent with those
for the inhibition of [sh]raclopride and
[sh]spiperone binding to dopamine d-2 receptors.

4. discussion

as fig. 5a and b shows, the k~ value of each
drug for the inhibition of [3h]ym-09151-2 binding was similar to that for the inhibition of
[3h]raclopride and [3h]spiperone binding to d-2
receptors. this is consistent with the report of
niznik et al. (1985) which showed the k i values of
d-2 antagonists for the inhibition of [3h]ym09151-2 binding to canine striatum to be highly
correlated with those for the inhibition of
[3h]spiperone binding to porcine anterior pitui-

lower than that of [3h]ym-09151-2 (broken line).

tary. therefore, [3h]ym-09151-2, [3h]raclopride
and [3h]spiperone may label an identical site of
dopamine d-2 receptors.
use of [3h]ym-09151-2 results in higher
specific binding and lower non-specific binding
than found with [3h]raclopride or [3h]spiperone
(figs. 1a and 3). the finding that the bmax of
dopamine d-2 receptors with [3 h]ym-09151-2 was
about 30% greater than the value for [3h]spiperone
or [3h]raclopride binding (figs. 1b and 2b) in the
striatum membranes is in agreement with the results of niznik et al. (1985). the bm,~ (72 f m o l / m g

branes with [3h]ym-09151-2 was similar to that
(77 f m o l / m g protein) with [3h]spiperone. in the
addition to the d-2 receptor, [3h]ym-09151-2
may bind to different sites such as 5-ht1a receptors in the striatum. however, 8-hydroxy-dpat
at the concentration of 100 nm, which completely
inhibits the binding to  xxxg1108xxx  (peroutka,
1986), was unable to affect the binding of
[3h]ym-09151-2 in the striatum. the slope values
for the inhibition by dopamine d-2 antagonists,
 xxxd2637xxx , sch23390,  xxxd2914xxx  and metabolites of ym-09151-2 in the present study were near
1.0 (table 2). these results suggests that [3h]ym09151-2 binds to a single site. as shown in fig. 5a
and b, the k i values of various drugs for [3h]ym09151-2 binding to the striatum were similar to
those for [3h]raclopride and [3h]spiperone binding to d-2 receptors. although it may be possible
that [3h]ym-09151-2 binds to sites other than the
d-2 receptor in the striatum, [3h]ym-09151-2
must have bound specifically to d-2 receptors
under the conditions of our study.
there was no difference in the inhibition of
[3h]ym-09151-2 binding by (r,r)ym-09151-2
and (s,s)ym-09151-2. this was consistent with
the results for [3h]spiperone binding to dopamine
d-2 receptors (k i = 0.10 vs. 0.11 nm), and the
results of pharmacological studies on the antidopaminergic effects (s. usuda, unpublished). the
potency of the desmethyl-derivative of ym-091512, m-1 to inhibit [3h]ym-09151-2 binding was

in summary, [3h]ym-09151-2 is a highly selective ligand for dopamine d-2 receptors with a
remarkablely high affinity (k a = 20 pm), and may
be the most suitable radioligand for the labelling
